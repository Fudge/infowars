[00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:02.610]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now
[00:00:27.992 --> 00:00:30.655]  Eight minutes into this second hour today.
[00:00:30.675 --> 00:00:34.178]  We're going to have open phones in this hour and the next.
[00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:38.102]  The toll-free number to join us on air for first-time callers.
[00:00:38.983 --> 00:00:47.751]  In the fourth hour today, it'll be wide open phones for everyone, but in the first
[00:00:50.692 --> 00:00:52.433]  Section of calls we're going to take today.
[00:00:53.113 --> 00:01:06.578]  I want to leave it open for first-time callers on the oil spill, on the demonization of the Tea Party, set to kick off into a new level tonight with Chris Matthews of MSNBC.
[00:01:07.138 --> 00:01:08.639]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:09.039]  Again, that's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:19.577 --> 00:01:28.479]  Again, we've been live for the last hour and eight minutes, but we are simulcasting now at PrisonPlanet.TV for video viewers out there.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.360]  And I just want to say something.
[00:01:33.141 --> 00:01:40.583]  I can't believe the amount of attention this radio show is starting to get, that my films are starting to get, that
[00:01:43.228 --> 00:01:45.189]  Our news websites are attaining.
[00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:48.131]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:52.894]  It is nothing less than mind-blowing what has been unfolding.
[00:01:54.535 --> 00:02:04.501]  The Drudge Report is now linking to Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com on average three times a week.
[00:02:07.843 --> 00:02:08.483]  That's a big deal.
[00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:23.662]  We are being discussed on Japanese television and radio, Russian television and radio, the biggest newspapers and magazines in France, in Germany, in a positive way.
[00:02:24.402 --> 00:02:26.403]  They say a prophet is not known in his own country.
[00:02:26.763 --> 00:02:37.545]  I am being demonized by Mother Jones, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, MSNBC, Salon, articles three or four a day.
[00:02:39.106 --> 00:02:40.346]  We have hit the zeitgeist.
[00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:46.173]  We have really hit the zeitgeist, and I want to say something right here.
[00:02:47.753 --> 00:02:50.274]  I am ashamed of the job I've done in the past.
[00:02:52.835 --> 00:03:02.499]  I do not get arrogant or on a power trip when I have this level of success.
[00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:03.639]  In fact, it's the opposite.
[00:03:09.241 --> 00:03:10.662]  I'm ashamed of the job I've done.
[00:03:13.715 --> 00:03:17.116]  Because I never intended to be this successful.
[00:03:17.376 --> 00:03:35.141]  I just was angry about attacks on the Second Amendment, attacks on the Bill of Rights, attacks on the Constitution, attacks on private property, abortion, dehumanization, the private Federal Reserve, out-of-control taxation.
[00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:39.122]  I was really a mainline libertarian Ron Paul type, 15, 16 years ago.
[00:03:41.738 --> 00:03:51.386]  And when I get up here and say that pedophile rings are one of the biggest cults or guilds running Washington, that's just what the facts always show.
[00:03:52.988 --> 00:04:01.115]  When I get up here... In fact, where's my newest article that Watson wrote that you guys had just brought in to me?
[00:04:01.135 --> 00:04:02.576]  Because you said it was in here.
[00:04:03.377 --> 00:04:04.978]  The one about population reduction.
[00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:06.600]  You had said it was in here.
[00:04:10.193 --> 00:04:11.635]  Yeah, just give me another one because it's not here.
[00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:14.160]  Thanks.
[00:04:16.383 --> 00:04:22.674]  When MSNBC demonizes me and says I'm insane because
[00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:30.493]  I talk about how the globalists want a world government to carry out an orderly population reduction.
[00:04:31.093 --> 00:04:33.074]  All I'm reading is State Department memorandums.
[00:04:33.454 --> 00:04:36.735]  All I'm reading is the 1996 UN Biological Diversity Assessment.
[00:04:37.135 --> 00:04:43.496]  All I'm reading is the Times of London with the headline, Ultra-rich meet in secret to discuss overpopulation.
[00:04:44.677 --> 00:04:50.078]  I mean, we actually in this office read, Aaron Dykes and I, the hundreds and hundreds of pages
[00:04:53.601 --> 00:05:02.908]  Of the 76 new vaccines being funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and upwards of half of them are for covert sterilization.
[00:05:10.193 --> 00:05:13.916]  Now, let me be clear about, you know, the point of saying I'm ashamed of the job I've done.
[00:05:17.738 --> 00:05:19.360]  I'm proud of the fact I've had a pure heart.
[00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:22.322]  I'm proud of the fact that
[00:05:23.936 --> 00:05:25.678]  I've been like a bulldog and never let go.
[00:05:30.302 --> 00:05:42.193]  I'm proud of the fact that my heart's been in the right place, but I can't help but look at all the opportunities I've had, and the squandered opportunities to wake people up, and the mistakes I've made.
[00:05:44.075 --> 00:05:46.818]  But then I understand that historically nobody's perfect.
[00:05:47.758 --> 00:05:49.240]  None of us have all of the answers.
[00:05:53.547 --> 00:05:55.228]  And that I've done the best I could.
[00:05:55.248 --> 00:06:10.478]  And that I'm trying right now to really go to the next level, to grow up, and to be more focused and more serious, and to really get in-depth into every subject I cover.
[00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:21.486]  Instead of just grazing over the surface, because I can't just make a pronouncement, even if I've documented it a thousand times in the past,
[00:06:22.685 --> 00:06:51.202]  On every TV show, on every radio show, in every article we write, in everything we do, in every film I make, I can't just condense the info and make a claim without going back and pointing to all the proof we've put on, because this information is so incredible, people are going to have trouble believing it, but if we're able to show them the proof each time, then, no matter how outrageous it is, it can be something that supercharges their awakening.
[00:06:53.718 --> 00:07:07.087]  I know it's crazy that every top globalist openly writes books and makes statements about forcibly sterilizing us, covertly sterilizing us, and bringing in an authoritarian world government to establish neo-feudalism.
[00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:20.236]  But that's what Peter Singer, and Dr. Pianka, and Holdren, and Paul Ehrlich, I mean that's all...
[00:07:22.881 --> 00:07:24.902]  There's more of them than you can shake a stick at.
[00:07:28.504 --> 00:07:33.827]  Any direction you look, once you understand this is going on, it's all they talk about.
[00:07:34.267 --> 00:07:35.248]  It's all they do.
[00:07:37.028 --> 00:07:40.811]  The guys printed a bunch of news for me today that was on the website that I hadn't even read.
[00:07:40.831 --> 00:07:42.612]  So I didn't get back until last night.
[00:07:43.233 --> 00:07:47.896]  And there's got to be four or five mainstream news articles about how great it is to not have any children.
[00:07:48.416 --> 00:07:50.498]  First it's only have one, now it's don't have any.
[00:07:51.138 --> 00:07:53.540]  And should there be taxes on having more than one kid?
[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:58.444]  And, oh, Bill and Melinda Gates, you know, have gotten $200 billion from Warren Buffett and themselves and others.
[00:07:58.784 --> 00:08:00.425]  Now they want $400 billion in others.
[00:08:00.825 --> 00:08:03.807]  They want tax breaks for the elite to give their money to eugenics.
[00:08:04.128 --> 00:08:05.529]  That's mainstream news today.
[00:08:06.129 --> 00:08:07.469]  Folks, this is real!
[00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:20.332]  And Chris Matthews writes a big hit piece, MSNBC, and cover-up of a manifestly provable population control plan.
[00:08:22.813 --> 00:08:28.094]  And MSNBC, the last two nights, they've attacked me on multiple shows.
[00:08:29.535 --> 00:08:30.035]  I found out
[00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:34.814]  Chris Matthews has been hitting me night after night, so have other shows on MSNBC.
[00:08:35.374 --> 00:08:39.055]  And on every show, they say, I'm going to cause violence.
[00:08:39.636 --> 00:08:40.836]  I'm calling for violence.
[00:08:41.296 --> 00:08:42.497]  I'm stirring up violence.
[00:08:43.077 --> 00:08:50.901]  And that's in the script we got that one of their people leaked us because they're concerned for the television program, Rise of the Right, that's going to air tonight.
[00:08:51.441 --> 00:08:52.861]  And I'm the finale of the program.
[00:08:53.522 --> 00:08:56.023]  I'm the king of the crazies, in their words.
[00:09:04.759 --> 00:09:10.125]  And they just said that I'm completely insane and there's no plan to reduce world population.
[00:09:13.569 --> 00:09:19.936]  Now, Pat Buchanan was on the panel, and I'm not attacking Pat here, but the issue is...
[00:09:21.092 --> 00:09:42.569]  He was in the Nixon White House, and I've seen his name in papers concerning forced population reduction that Nixon and Kissinger and George Herbert Walker Bush were obsessed with, and Pat Buchanan has actually written about this in the past, and he wrote about this in Death of the West, and he knows fully about it, and he sat there and kept his mouth shut during this.
[00:09:44.232 --> 00:09:54.778]  He was in the White House at a high level when State Department memorandum 200 was secretly published and circulated to the CIA under the orders of Richard Milhouse Nixon.
[00:09:55.118 --> 00:10:07.886]  And when George Herbert Walker was sent to China to sign the secret treaty for a one-child policy and that China would be given hundreds of billions in tax incentives in the U.S.
[00:10:08.993 --> 00:10:09.573]  That is, U.S.
[00:10:09.614 --> 00:10:21.903]  companies would be in the aggregate and lowered tariffs in the aggregate that would be just tens of trillions to move industry there if they would have a one-child policy and be a model for world government.
[00:10:23.664 --> 00:10:27.807]  In this secret alliance between China and the United States that's now been declassified.
[00:10:32.951 --> 00:10:36.094]  Where the two countries actually looked at nuking Russia together.
[00:10:40.939 --> 00:10:46.281]  And of course it's now been declassified as the headlines have been everywhere that McCarthy was right.
[00:10:46.921 --> 00:10:49.222]  The Pentagon ran the Soviet Union basically.
[00:10:50.882 --> 00:10:53.763]  Except for a short time when Stalin broke away and kicked Trotsky out.
[00:10:55.444 --> 00:10:57.665]  Then he came over here and founded the neocons, that's on record.
[00:10:58.845 --> 00:11:04.527]  And that they put him in power and that Mao Zedong was put in power by the CIA in 49.
[00:11:04.867 --> 00:11:06.568]  I mean that is all declassified now.
[00:11:06.928 --> 00:11:09.549]  Think of how monstrous and evil our government is.
[00:11:15.382 --> 00:11:18.064]  Now, you got too many Chinese, you'll never be stable.
[00:11:18.685 --> 00:11:24.869]  If you kill tens of millions of them, and if you set up a one-child policy, the money's gonna flow.
[00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:26.630]  This is in 49.
[00:11:28.672 --> 00:11:33.416]  And that's why the CFR says the Chinese century, and how America's done.
[00:11:33.896 --> 00:11:35.337]  Because China is the model.
[00:11:36.318 --> 00:11:37.098]  But I digress.
[00:11:38.299 --> 00:11:40.701]  Look, I don't care if Chris Matthews demonizes me.
[00:11:41.061 --> 00:11:44.164]  I don't care if Chris Matthews is trying to set me up for a fault.
[00:11:45.225 --> 00:11:47.106]  I don't care if Chris Matthews is framing me.
[00:11:47.907 --> 00:11:50.048]  I can't shut up knowing this information.
[00:11:50.588 --> 00:11:52.990]  We're gonna come back, get to these video clips, analyze it.
[00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:56.092]  Then we'll get into the oil spill, your phone calls, and a lot more.
[00:11:56.112 --> 00:11:56.472]  Stay with us.
[00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:01.039]  The problem.
[00:12:01.139 --> 00:12:03.200]  How do I cook food without power?
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.861]  How do I light my home with no electricity?
[00:12:06.421 --> 00:12:08.621]  How do I get emergency radio broadcasts?
[00:12:09.101 --> 00:12:10.722]  How can I make safe drinking water?
[00:12:11.602 --> 00:12:20.385]  When your power goes out, the solution for cooking, baking, home lighting, listening to the radio, and producing clean water is the Family Emergency Kit from KaroStove.

[00:13:58.539 --> 00:14:08.287]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[00:14:08.567 --> 00:14:14.612]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[00:14:15.012 --> 00:14:23.859]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[00:14:24.239 --> 00:14:33.146]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[00:14:33.427 --> 00:14:38.010]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:39.592]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[00:16:12.686 --> 00:16:35.282]  What I was trying to say in so many words last segment is I am humbled by the incredible attention this broadcast has given worldwide and I am doing my very best to be a hundred percent accurate

[00:16:51.286 --> 00:16:59.573]  Whether it be by spreading the word about the broadcast or defending us when people lie about us.
[00:17:02.981 --> 00:17:05.684]  Financially supporting us by buying the books and videos.
[00:17:06.424 --> 00:17:09.427]  Because I realize that I'm committed to this 110%.
[00:17:09.467 --> 00:17:11.849]  There's no going back.
[00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:15.633]  I passed the point of no return more than a decade ago.
[00:17:17.635 --> 00:17:19.556]  But all of us have passed the point of no return.
[00:17:19.596 --> 00:17:22.459]  This New World Order comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:24.961]  It is tyranny incarnate.
[00:17:25.342 --> 00:17:27.584]  It is evil in its very essence.
[00:17:29.423 --> 00:17:36.450]  It has set itself against everything good and transparent and wholesome and enlightened.
[00:17:38.952 --> 00:17:45.518]  This global system competes with itself to be more wicked and more oppressive.
[00:17:46.439 --> 00:17:50.002]  And I've always told people, don't defend me when the mainstream media attacks.
[00:17:51.483 --> 00:17:51.964]  Move on.
[00:17:54.224 --> 00:18:11.072]  Stay on target, stay on issues, like the North American Union, globalization, inflation tax, illegal wars, torture, federalization of police, stage terror, genetically engineered food, population reduction, the danger of vaccines.
[00:18:12.612 --> 00:18:22.257]  But more and more I realize that it's important to stay on target, to continue to get issues out, but that what I didn't want to happen has happened.
[00:18:23.445 --> 00:18:26.387]  I never wanted this to be about Alex Jones.
[00:18:27.548 --> 00:18:30.290]  I wanted it to be about the information.
[00:18:33.332 --> 00:18:34.753]  And it is about the information.
[00:18:34.913 --> 00:18:36.695]  But people love tribal leaders.
[00:18:36.755 --> 00:18:39.156]  They love characters.
[00:18:39.216 --> 00:18:40.918]  They love the hero archetype.
[00:18:41.698 --> 00:18:52.086]  And so much of my message now, which is just the reality of what's happening in the world, is now bound up in my identity.
[00:18:53.359 --> 00:18:54.500]  Bound up in my name.
[00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:57.062]  Bound up in the symbol of what I am.
[00:19:00.425 --> 00:19:01.746]  And how people perceive me.
[00:19:05.229 --> 00:19:06.330]  And I like to screw around.
[00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:09.473]  I like to play the part of characters and joke and have some fun.
[00:19:09.493 --> 00:19:17.180]  I like to be lazy intellectually and get angry and yell and scream and that's certainly entertaining and part of what built this radio show.
[00:19:18.201 --> 00:19:19.402]  But none of it was intentional.
[00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:45.278]  And now I'm just trying to gauge the true success we've had in affecting the way that hundreds of millions of people see the world, unlocking their minds, taking the blinders off their eyes, and now I am being directly targeted by the system.
[00:19:45.898 --> 00:19:51.580]  And as Gandhi said, first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:56.531]  But many people don't make it to the final process.
[00:19:56.951 --> 00:20:08.753]  The idea makes it to the winning, but many times the leader doesn't make it out, in fact most the time, of the then-they-attack-you phase.
[00:20:09.433 --> 00:20:17.155]  And to have Chris Matthews, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the ADL, the New York Times, Time Magazine, Newsweek, the London Guardian,
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:27.824]  Salon, hundreds of other publications lying about me and saying that I'm basically calling for violence and that I want people to kill cops.
[00:20:28.184 --> 00:20:29.544]  Do you know why that's being done?
[00:20:32.105 --> 00:20:35.587]  That is being done so when they kill me deader than a hammer,
[00:20:37.498 --> 00:20:39.760]  It can be sold as, well, he deserved it.
[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:41.941]  He was messing with our precious protectors.
[00:20:42.822 --> 00:20:46.545]  Or when they stage a terror attack, so it can be blamed on yours truly.
[00:20:47.265 --> 00:20:52.229]  I've now entered that zone of intensifying danger.
[00:20:52.349 --> 00:20:55.531]  And the funny thing is, I'm not concerned about that in the least.
[00:20:55.571 --> 00:20:57.193]  In fact, it's invigorating.
[00:20:58.434 --> 00:21:04.038]  And not on an emotional level, not at an adrenaline level, but at a spiritual level.
[00:21:04.138 --> 00:21:05.299]  It is extremely
[00:21:06.837 --> 00:21:07.537]  Purifying.
[00:21:08.938 --> 00:21:09.678]  Satisfying.
[00:21:10.758 --> 00:21:11.378]  Deep down.
[00:21:12.779 --> 00:21:15.260]  To know that I set out to fight corruption.
[00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:18.020]  I set out to fight the scientific dictatorship.
[00:21:18.621 --> 00:21:21.622]  I am disgusted at every level by tyranny.
[00:21:22.782 --> 00:21:29.144]  And now I have the attentions of the dragon.
[00:21:30.224 --> 00:21:32.465]  Which means I have irritated the dragon.
[00:21:34.758 --> 00:21:36.820]  Which means the dragon is not invincible.
[00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:42.945]  And if I've had this much success, with all of my problems, think of the success you can have.
[00:21:43.505 --> 00:21:46.408]  So don't get caught up in thinking you've got to do a perfect job.
[00:21:46.748 --> 00:21:48.549]  Just engage the evil.
[00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:50.531]  We're on the march.
[00:21:51.011 --> 00:21:52.613]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:53.533 --> 00:21:56.236]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:58.749 --> 00:22:02.992]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:22:03.292 --> 00:22:03.913]  Number one.
[00:22:04.213 --> 00:22:07.375]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:22:07.636 --> 00:22:08.196]  Number two.
[00:22:08.496 --> 00:22:13.040]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:13.840]  It's true.
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:18.684]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:22:19.004 --> 00:22:19.544]  Number three.
[00:22:19.825 --> 00:22:23.107]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:22:23.407 --> 00:22:27.110]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:27.870]  Number four.
[00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:30.471]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:22:30.871 --> 00:22:34.252]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:22:34.552 --> 00:22:35.072]  Number five.
[00:22:35.332 --> 00:22:39.253]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:22:39.473 --> 00:22:44.255]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:22:44.535 --> 00:22:48.556]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:23:58.902 --> 00:24:01.503]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:24:01.924 --> 00:24:06.886]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:24:07.246 --> 00:24:08.967]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:24:09.287 --> 00:24:14.050]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:15.251]  How much do you want?
[00:24:15.471 --> 00:24:16.212]  When do you want it?
[00:24:16.593 --> 00:24:18.194]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:24:18.474 --> 00:24:19.295]  When will you need it?
[00:24:19.555 --> 00:24:21.618]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:24:21.758 --> 00:24:22.859]  Will there be any food?
[00:24:23.099 --> 00:24:24.440]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:29.686]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:24:29.906 --> 00:24:33.089]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:24:33.489 --> 00:24:36.953]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:24:37.293 --> 00:24:38.274]  How much will you need?
[00:24:38.514 --> 00:24:39.135]  We don't know.
[00:24:39.415 --> 00:24:40.336]  How much do you want?
[00:24:40.516 --> 00:24:41.257]  All you can get.
[00:24:41.457 --> 00:24:42.298]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:24:42.538 --> 00:24:45.300]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:24:45.601 --> 00:24:45.961]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:24:46.121 --> 00:24:47.783]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:24:47.803 --> 00:24:48.804]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:25:11.613 --> 00:25:16.855]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us.
[00:25:18.056 --> 00:25:25.179]  And again, I talk about myself sometimes in relation to the New World Order because that's how we all relate to the world as individuals.
[00:25:25.639 --> 00:25:30.341]  Because I know the journey I've gone through is similar to the journey many of you have experienced.
[00:25:31.082 --> 00:25:32.502]  You've experienced things that I haven't.
[00:25:32.923 --> 00:25:34.723]  I've experienced things that you haven't individually.
[00:25:34.763 --> 00:25:37.305]  But overall, our journeys are very similar.
[00:25:40.186 --> 00:25:40.306]  And
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.104]  Together we can beat this new world order.
[00:25:44.625 --> 00:25:47.309]  That's what my mission has been a testament to.
[00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:51.316]  That if we take action against corruption, we can win.
[00:25:52.506 --> 00:25:55.027]  And the system knows that it's discredited.
[00:25:55.067 --> 00:25:58.729]  The system knows that the people are aware of what it's doing.
[00:25:59.229 --> 00:26:03.330]  The system knows that the population is waking up faster and faster.
[00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:09.433]  That's why they're desperate to inject race into every issue or religion into every issue.
[00:26:09.893 --> 00:26:11.514]  They need distractions.
[00:26:11.794 --> 00:26:14.175]  And it's just like the movie The Truman Show.
[00:26:15.076 --> 00:26:19.286]  As Truman wakes up to what's happening, they try to put more and more fear into him.
[00:26:19.366 --> 00:26:23.536]  More and more of these fears that were inculcated into Truman at birth.
[00:26:25.131 --> 00:26:46.796]  They intensify those, and at the final scene of the movie, where he's trying to get across the little sea to the other side of the set, in this controlled paradigm, this controlled reality of the mind that he's in, they turn the storm up on high, and he has to risk his life, and the boat even tumps over, and almost kills him, but that makes him an even bigger hero.
[00:26:47.796 --> 00:26:52.297]  And the system at the end knows they can't kill him, because the whole world is watching.
[00:26:54.619 --> 00:26:57.062]  Well, my awakening's been similar to the Truman Show.
[00:26:57.423 --> 00:27:01.227]  Your awakening, individually, is similar to the Truman Show, or the Matrix.
[00:27:01.528 --> 00:27:12.222]  These are archetypal examples of this, but many of us do have to die in that little boat trying to get to the other side, trying to get out of the Matrix.
[00:27:14.036 --> 00:27:17.459]  Until the people do see the nature of the tyrants.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:23.604]  I mean, look at this incredible news that Rob Jacobson just brought into me a few segments ago.
[00:27:24.225 --> 00:27:29.830]  The IPCC consensus on climate change was phony, says IPCC insider.
[00:27:30.971 --> 00:27:39.999]  The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change misled the press and public into believing that thousands of scientists backed its claims on man-made global warming, according to Mike
[00:27:41.544 --> 00:27:46.825]  Holman, a prominent scientist, climate scientist, and IPCC insider.
[00:27:47.486 --> 00:27:59.089]  The actual number of scientists who backed the claim was only a few dozen experts, he states, in a paper for Progress in Physical Geography, co-authored with student Martin Mahoney.
[00:28:00.209 --> 00:28:01.430]  Now, we told you this day one.
[00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:09.872]  They just put 2,500 scientist names on that, said every scientist in the world agrees the science is set
[00:28:11.024 --> 00:28:15.025]  And then thousands of those scientists sent letters in saying, take my name off.
[00:28:15.565 --> 00:28:16.646]  I never was part of this.
[00:28:16.666 --> 00:28:17.406]  This is a fraud.
[00:28:17.426 --> 00:28:19.287]  And the UN said, no, we won't.
[00:28:21.547 --> 00:28:22.868]  Well, here's the actual paper.
[00:28:23.188 --> 00:28:24.028]  Climate change.
[00:28:24.368 --> 00:28:26.929]  What do we know about the IPCC?
[00:28:32.372 --> 00:28:41.418]  And it says, without a careful explanation about what it means, the drive for consensus can leave the IPCC vulnerable to outside criticism.
[00:28:41.958 --> 00:28:45.200]  This is quoting from an internal IPCC report that they quoted here.
[00:28:45.781 --> 00:28:50.283]  Claims such as 2,500 of the world's leading scientists
[00:28:51.244 --> 00:28:57.473]  Have reached a consensus that human activities are having a significant influence on climate are disingenuous.
[00:28:57.873 --> 00:29:08.087]  That particular consensus judgment as are many others in the IPCC report is reached by only a few dozen experts in the specific field of detection and
[00:29:09.068 --> 00:29:10.169]  Attribution studies.
[00:29:10.249 --> 00:29:33.681]  Well, we have the UN report from seven months ago that got leaked, which the UN admits is their report, from a decade ago where they said we've got to go out and literally finance the heads of these key universities in England, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the US, and Germany to have them be the, quote, leaders of the movement and we're going to get global socialism
[00:29:35.237 --> 00:29:36.578]  Out of this carbon tax.
[00:29:37.138 --> 00:29:39.200]  I mean, what an incredible document that came out.
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.642]  We know exactly what's going on here.
[00:29:45.964 --> 00:29:51.467]  And we have the former head of the IPCC told Jesse Ventura.
[00:29:52.247 --> 00:29:53.948]  They got an interview with a santer.
[00:29:55.169 --> 00:29:55.830]  Bill Santer.
[00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:57.731]  It's amazing what a celebrity can do.
[00:29:58.091 --> 00:29:59.332]  The people that will talk to Ventura.
[00:30:00.032 --> 00:30:04.455]  The word is on this news season, it's unbelievable who they're getting interviews with, but I'll just leave it at that.
[00:30:13.274 --> 00:30:15.055]  By the way, guys, remind me to call Ventura today.
[00:30:15.075 --> 00:30:16.417]  I'm supposed to call him back yesterday.
[00:30:16.437 --> 00:30:23.862]  He's going to be on the show next week or the next week, but I've got to line it up with him in the next week or start of the week after that.
[00:30:28.826 --> 00:30:29.327]  I digress.
[00:30:29.367 --> 00:30:31.088]  I'm just remembering responsibilities I have.
[00:30:31.809 --> 00:30:33.850]  I'm consulting for that show.
[00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:35.271]  I've got a bunch of questions I've got to answer.
[00:30:36.452 --> 00:30:36.993]  Side issue.
[00:30:39.773 --> 00:30:46.542]  Santer admitted, yes, there were a bunch of scientists in our report who disagreed, so we pulled them out.
[00:30:47.864 --> 00:30:49.446]  On the inner panel, not the 2,500 fake list.
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:31:10.078]  You've got Al Gore coming out and saying, this is 100%, 100% of scientists agree man-made global warming is real, and is a real threat to humanity, and that sea levels will rise, and that both the Arctic and Antarctic will completely melt in the next 7 years.
[00:31:10.098 --> 00:31:12.281]  He said that 10 years ago, and again 3 years ago.
[00:31:12.341 --> 00:31:12.982]  It never happens.
[00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:19.431]  Knowing it was all a lie.
[00:31:19.571 --> 00:31:20.792]  Just everyone agrees.
[00:31:20.812 --> 00:31:24.675]  It's like saying everyone loves communism or everyone loves Nazis.
[00:31:24.935 --> 00:31:26.536]  Just there's no questioning.
[00:31:26.636 --> 00:31:27.336]  Everyone loves them.
[00:31:29.998 --> 00:31:32.280]  By the way, I don't watch a lot of unfiltered television.
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:44.308]  By filtered, I end up, you know, watching videos online that people send me and my audience kind of, I guess, filters things because they're just sending me what they're watching or what they're into and it's all New World Order.
[00:31:45.028 --> 00:31:47.450]  I ended up watching probably two hours of television.
[00:31:49.022 --> 00:32:04.573]  This weekend, when I was there in the cabin with my kids on a fishing trip, and they had satellite TV, and I was trying to find stuff for the kids to watch, because it was so hot during the midday, you know, to be outside fishing and swimming.
[00:32:06.415 --> 00:32:10.658]  And I would try to watch PBS kids shows, total brainwashing.
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:16.723]  Pro-vaccine, pro-world government, anti-family, you know, pro-tattle on your parents.
[00:32:17.263 --> 00:32:18.704]  I'd flip over to History Channel.
[00:32:18.744 --> 00:32:20.285]  The humans are killing everything.
[00:32:20.345 --> 00:32:21.066]  Everything's bad.
[00:32:21.546 --> 00:32:23.427]  Then I went to a local store.
[00:32:24.608 --> 00:32:27.750]  They had a children's book about alligators for $4.
[00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:28.910]  I bought it.
[00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:31.432]  It was all about how humans are evil and killing all the alligators.
[00:32:32.052 --> 00:32:34.974]  I mean, it's just, we are bathed in brainwashing.
[00:32:35.054 --> 00:32:37.316]  It's just, it's just everywhere.
[00:32:38.596 --> 00:32:39.177]  I mean, it's just,
[00:32:40.546 --> 00:32:53.386]  You can't go in a store to buy worms and see a couple of kids books on fishing and there was a book uh... something alligator the big lizard was the name of it
[00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:56.251]  I actually own the stinking thing.
[00:32:56.291 --> 00:32:57.672]  I meant to bring it in here and show it to you.
[00:32:58.012 --> 00:32:58.592]  That's what I mean.
[00:32:58.632 --> 00:32:59.733]  There's no way!
[00:33:00.273 --> 00:33:02.074]  How can the public not wake up to this?
[00:33:02.094 --> 00:33:07.778]  Well, it's like being a fish who is swimming in all of this propaganda.
[00:33:07.798 --> 00:33:13.781]  There is so much of it that there's no way to even be able to recognize it when it's one inch away from your face.
[00:33:14.061 --> 00:33:16.603]  But if you pull back and look at it, you can see what it is clearly.
[00:33:26.371 --> 00:33:30.072]  I said I'd take calls, I said I'd get into the oil spill, I said I'd get into Chris Matthews.
[00:33:30.092 --> 00:33:37.055]  It's just fathomless.
[00:33:38.456 --> 00:33:51.861]  More and more I realize that I just can't come to grips myself with how big this is, how real this is.
[00:33:56.155 --> 00:34:02.580]  The globalists know that if they present us something as if it's reality, nine times out of ten people will accept it.
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:15.529]  And so they've been introducing a more and more ridiculous version of reality, a more and more obviously false version, but because we bought into all the other previous versions of this matrix that's being built around us,
[00:34:16.823 --> 00:34:34.099]  That now we're literally being inserted into the virtual reality through our iPhones and computers and electronics and all those false memes and information they're giving us, that we're seeing humanity really being suffocated by this propaganda.
[00:34:39.884 --> 00:34:40.965]  Here are some of the headlines.
[00:34:47.426 --> 00:34:50.231]  American arrested searching for Osama Bin Laden.
[00:34:52.475 --> 00:34:53.156]  There's another one.
[00:34:53.216 --> 00:34:53.897]  London Guardian.
[00:34:54.398 --> 00:35:00.349]  Food prices to rise by up to 40% over next decade, UN report warns.
[00:35:06.505 --> 00:35:13.389]  And you notice that the globalist always poses the saviors for the crisis that they themselves create?
[00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:14.970]  Have you ever noticed that?
[00:35:15.491 --> 00:35:23.996]  Growing demand from emerging markets for biofuel production will send prices soaring, according to OECD and the UN Food Agriculture Organization.
[00:35:24.457 --> 00:35:29.660]  When it's the UN that's been pushing for biofuel the whole time, that's part of Obama's new energy plan.
[00:35:34.091 --> 00:35:39.074]  Steele accuses Obama of exploiting oil spill for political gain ahead of the Republican National Committee.
[00:35:39.434 --> 00:35:40.034]  Well, no kidding.
[00:35:42.096 --> 00:35:43.156]  No kidding, Sherlock.
[00:35:43.777 --> 00:35:44.917]  Price increases.
[00:35:47.178 --> 00:35:49.140]  Fuel fears of food crisis.
[00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:51.741]  That's the Financial Times of London article.
[00:35:52.181 --> 00:35:57.544]  And again, the UN is going to save us from the problem that they've been tasked with organizing.
[00:35:58.405 --> 00:36:00.606]  In State Department Memorandum 200 alone,
[00:36:02.719 --> 00:36:10.163]  It's a giant program for the UN to create artificial food shortages and wars to reduce population.
[00:36:12.144 --> 00:36:19.748]  Nightmare vision for Europe as EU chief warns democracy could disappear in Greece, Spain and Portugal.
[00:36:20.448 --> 00:36:25.250]  EU began emergency bullion pound bailout of Spain.
[00:36:26.451 --> 00:36:33.093]  Says democracy could collapse in Greece, Spain and Portugal unless urgent action is taken to tackle debt crisis, the head of the European Commission has warned.
[00:36:33.533 --> 00:36:35.133]  And then, what are they talking about?
[00:36:35.173 --> 00:36:45.256]  Democracy means giving all your money to the bankers, because when you actually read it says that they're worried about popular uprisings by the people against the banks.
[00:36:45.836 --> 00:36:51.998]  So democracy means keeping the people out of their government and making sure the banks can turn you all into slaves.
[00:36:52.858 --> 00:36:54.919]  We've got to learn how to decipher what they're saying.
[00:36:54.939 --> 00:36:58.061]  But the article goes on to say, the public is going to overthrow us.
[00:36:58.441 --> 00:37:05.605]  Well, the British Ministry of Defense and the Pentagon in 2007 both published detailed reports saying the banks are going to have sold all these derivatives.
[00:37:05.945 --> 00:37:08.807]  It's a debt black hole designed to create a global government.
[00:37:09.987 --> 00:37:13.589]  And when we implode it, the public's going to start rioting as they go bankrupt.
[00:37:13.889 --> 00:37:16.531]  And it's going to be our job to suppress them to bring in the new world order.
[00:37:17.472 --> 00:37:20.875]  I mean, I have NPR today calling it Obama's New World Order.
[00:37:20.895 --> 00:37:22.176]  In fact, here it is.
[00:37:22.236 --> 00:37:22.897]  Here's the headline.
[00:37:24.218 --> 00:37:26.520]  Battle plan for a New World Order.
[00:37:29.073 --> 00:37:31.674]  Their entire carbon tax plan was dead.
[00:37:31.694 --> 00:37:41.698]  Now Obama says he's going to implement it through the EPA regardless of what the Senate does, but praised the House legislation and said he's going to implement it because inaction is not acceptable.
[00:37:42.078 --> 00:37:53.182]  There he is blocking the Dutch, blocking the Norwegians with their big skimmers that could have handled a lot of it, not allowing a mass burn day one when the oil was contained and would have burned off at the surface there in one spot before it spread.
[00:37:53.562 --> 00:37:57.324]  Wouldn't let the counties and cities and states block the oil in the estuaries.
[00:37:58.607 --> 00:38:12.324]  It's BP, the top globalist, biggest funder of carbon tax propaganda, and BP says they're going to put $20 billion in an escrow account based on derivatives when BP is in the top five of hedge funds?
[00:38:15.147 --> 00:38:18.031]  That's nothing for them over a decade, $20 billion.
[00:38:19.272 --> 00:38:23.274]  Off the money the banks that own BP are going to get off of the carbon tax.
[00:38:24.115 --> 00:38:27.537]  BP has invested more than $20 billion.
[00:38:27.997 --> 00:38:29.898]  And Watson's written articles about that in the past.
[00:38:30.339 --> 00:38:31.880]  They don't care if their name gets destroyed.
[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:34.381]  In fact, I said this last week and now it's been announced.
[00:38:34.641 --> 00:38:37.023]  They're going to create new names and new subsidiaries.
[00:38:37.323 --> 00:38:39.804]  DynCorp gets caught running giant child kidnapping rings.
[00:38:40.085 --> 00:38:41.125]  They just change their name.
[00:38:41.505 --> 00:38:42.106]  They don't care.
[00:38:47.213 --> 00:38:47.453]  U.S.
[00:38:47.493 --> 00:38:55.497]  President pushes green energy, yes, windmills, things that cost two jobs for every job they make, things that are payoffs to his crony buddies.
[00:38:58.158 --> 00:39:04.620]  Boehner says Obama exploiting crisis to push job-killing energy tax.
[00:39:05.701 --> 00:39:07.802]  You guys call Watson, there's a typo in that.
[00:39:07.822 --> 00:39:14.665]  It says, thank you, it says Obama exploiting crisis to puss job-killing energy tax.
[00:39:18.114 --> 00:39:19.976]  And I know that's from Boehner's own side.
[00:39:19.996 --> 00:39:21.297]  I'm sure Boehner has the mistake.
[00:39:21.357 --> 00:39:22.257]  Let's just fix it for him.
[00:39:23.258 --> 00:39:23.538]  U.S.
[00:39:23.558 --> 00:39:25.500]  Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:26.961]  Oval Office speech.
[00:39:27.541 --> 00:39:31.865]  Should be an opportunity to unite the country, not call for new national energy tax.
[00:39:33.326 --> 00:39:33.826]  Here's another one.
[00:39:33.886 --> 00:39:37.569]  Obama to demand BP pay for oil spill damage.
[00:39:37.889 --> 00:39:39.791]  They had a 20-minute meeting.
[00:39:40.111 --> 00:39:41.552]  It was all on teleprompters.
[00:39:41.932 --> 00:39:42.713]  Not a real meeting.
[00:39:44.334 --> 00:39:45.055]  They just had that.
[00:39:46.107 --> 00:39:48.288]  Here's another article from the Washington Examiner.
[00:39:48.809 --> 00:39:52.251]  BP was founding member of Cap-and-Trade Lobby.
[00:39:53.672 --> 00:39:58.415]  And I know we've already covered this at Nauseam, but it's interesting to see another article about it that boils down the actual facts.
[00:39:58.455 --> 00:40:01.977]  I mean, they are the greenie, meanie, mighty weenies.
[00:40:02.618 --> 00:40:04.059]  I mean, they are the ones.
[00:40:04.119 --> 00:40:05.920]  They are the King Daddies.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:06.600]  BP.
[00:40:07.301 --> 00:40:08.782]  British Eugenics Petroleum.
[00:40:12.622 --> 00:40:12.982]  Look at this.
[00:40:13.142 --> 00:40:13.563]  Wow!
[00:40:13.983 --> 00:40:16.765]  Jets punch holes in clouds and create rain.
[00:40:16.846 --> 00:40:18.027]  LiveScience.com.
[00:40:18.827 --> 00:40:23.351]  Aircraft can accidentally punch holes in clouds, leaving a trail of snow or rain in their wake.
[00:40:23.651 --> 00:40:29.196]  A new study finds... Oh, it turns out all those trails you're seeing, all those chemtrails now suddenly form lower.
[00:40:30.377 --> 00:40:37.403]  Yeah, we happen to have the Pentagon document where they talk about how they put the chemicals in the jet fuel that are then dispersed by the jet engines.
[00:40:38.344 --> 00:40:40.405]  Oh yeah, this chemtrail film I've got coming out in October.
[00:40:41.331 --> 00:40:42.352]  Or November, I'm not sure.
[00:40:42.792 --> 00:40:44.653]  Yet, it's all documented.
[00:40:44.733 --> 00:40:46.194]  It's all a public secret.
[00:40:46.854 --> 00:40:49.475]  We're not gonna... This film isn't about conspiracy theories, folks.
[00:40:49.795 --> 00:40:52.057]  But, oh, now there's... Oh, there is some trails!
[00:40:52.817 --> 00:40:55.078]  Oh, it's a hot day and you see a trail of 2,000 feet?
[00:40:55.298 --> 00:40:56.139]  That's quite normal.
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:05.703]  Turboprop and jet aircraft that climb or descend under certain atmospheric conditions can invariably trigger what's known as cloud seeding.
[00:41:06.344 --> 00:41:09.225]  The technology is usually associated with schemes to control the weather.
[00:41:09.926 --> 00:41:10.086]  Oh!
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:24.310]  However, cloud seeding can happen by accident as planes soaring through the mid-level clouds can leave behind odd-shaped holes or channels in the clouds and cause narrow bands of snow or rain to develop and fall to the ground.
[00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:26.932]  No, these are chemical clouds that just hang up there.
[00:41:27.592 --> 00:41:32.236]  Holes punched in the clouds are a phenomenon that has been recognized for many years and seen in photos around the world.
[00:41:32.596 --> 00:41:39.562]  A front-page feature on Yahoo carried the headline, a halo over Moscow, after photos emerged of just such a hole in October.
[00:41:40.501 --> 00:41:41.362]  And it's a big whitewash.
[00:41:41.943 --> 00:41:42.444]  Here's another one.
[00:41:42.684 --> 00:41:45.068]  New concerns arise over body scanners, L.A.
[00:41:45.088 --> 00:41:45.408]  Times.
[00:41:45.729 --> 00:41:48.192]  This tells you exactly what we covered last year and this year.
[00:41:49.173 --> 00:41:53.199]  They do not, in the Dutch and British studies, find knives and weapons.
[00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:55.743]  They aren't even as good as x-ray machines.
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:04.145]  But, Chertoff makes a bunch of money, and it does biometrically scan your body for passive scanner systems.
[00:42:04.365 --> 00:42:13.531]  Even if you're wearing a mask, they can then get your identity on the street, and they want your naked images just for their enjoyment, and to humiliate you and set the precedent that they dominate you.
[00:42:14.485 --> 00:42:20.569]  But this admits it, and says people can also hide bombs in their orifices, so the government wants chest x-rays.
[00:42:20.809 --> 00:42:21.670]  And they are going to do it.
[00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:25.152]  They'll say, we don't care if it gives you cancer, we're going to chest x-ray you.
[00:42:25.452 --> 00:42:27.234]  It's all about being outrageous.
[00:42:27.694 --> 00:42:30.136]  Everything the government's doing now is about being outrageous.
[00:42:33.598 --> 00:42:37.861]  Aviation security experts say machines may miss items that metal detectors catch.
[00:42:38.281 --> 00:42:42.464]  Airline passengers may also be able to hide materials in their groin or body cavities.
[00:42:45.851 --> 00:42:47.113]  Here's another one coming soon.
[00:42:47.213 --> 00:42:48.675]  Unmanned aircraft all over U.S.
[00:42:48.695 --> 00:42:49.196]  skies.
[00:42:50.097 --> 00:42:50.637]  Here's another one.
[00:42:50.677 --> 00:42:54.503]  Federal judge cites Voting Rights Act to rig elections in New York.
[00:42:55.184 --> 00:42:56.625]  Yeah, you now get six votes.
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:02.381]  If you suffer from poor sleep, you've got to try MyPillow.

[00:43:50.998 --> 00:43:51.319]  MyPillow.
[00:43:51.399 --> 00:43:52.319]  For the rest of your life.
[00:43:59.389 --> 00:44:00.650]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:06.055]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:44:06.295 --> 00:44:10.919]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:44:11.319 --> 00:44:11.720]  It's true.
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:16.383]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:44:16.884 --> 00:44:21.588]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:44:22.108 --> 00:44:23.990]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:44:24.423 --> 00:44:29.026]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:44:29.227 --> 00:44:30.107]  And here's the best part.
[00:44:30.327 --> 00:44:33.109]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:36.712]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:44:37.032 --> 00:44:39.854]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:44:40.214 --> 00:44:42.116]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:44:42.436 --> 00:44:43.297]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:44:43.317 --> 00:44:43.537]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:44:51.232 --> 00:44:55.744]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:44:56.065 --> 00:44:58.472]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:44:59.597 --> 00:45:02.518]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[00:45:02.598 --> 00:45:04.559]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[00:45:04.659 --> 00:45:07.320]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:09.360]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:10.821]  Okay, here it comes.
[00:45:11.041 --> 00:45:12.942]  But first, the facts.
[00:45:12.962 --> 00:45:14.662]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[00:45:14.882 --> 00:45:16.603]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[00:45:16.863 --> 00:45:20.344]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[00:45:20.544 --> 00:45:27.947]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[00:45:28.307 --> 00:45:28.907]  Sinofresh.

[00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:48.510]  Call right now for $2 off per bottle.
[00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:48.890]  Mention GCN.
[00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:49.710]  Buy Sinofresh.com.
[00:45:49.851 --> 00:45:50.031]  It works!
[00:46:13.024 --> 00:46:18.870]  Back in the start of the hour, I began to thank Matt Drudge.
[00:46:20.832 --> 00:46:26.237]  And I do want to thank him for the tremendous traffic he's sending InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:46:27.867 --> 00:46:29.548]  Well, that's got the system hopping mad.
[00:46:29.708 --> 00:46:35.150]  Millions of new visitors a week to Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com from Matt Drudge.
[00:46:35.991 --> 00:46:44.074]  And he linked to Paul Watson's article about the flick of a switch allows Obama to shut down the Internet.
[00:46:44.914 --> 00:46:47.696]  And that's actually what the National Security Strategy
[00:46:48.757 --> 00:46:58.021]  May 2010 report says, now last year they had said cyber security gives them the power to shut the web off, but now the White House says that in their own words.
[00:46:59.102 --> 00:47:08.005]  So sure, this is newsworthy information, but to have it up on the Drudge Report, we would have probably had maybe 100,000 viewers read that article.
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:12.941]  On our website, then hundreds of other sites would have posted it.
[00:47:13.362 --> 00:47:15.823]  So all totaled, quite a few would have seen it.
[00:47:16.103 --> 00:47:21.946]  But now because Drudge links to it, when Drudge links, that then makes all the other media start reading it.
[00:47:21.986 --> 00:47:29.210]  Because I've been in national radio host offices, I've been in national media studios, I've been everywhere.
[00:47:29.250 --> 00:47:30.791]  And you see the Drudge Report open.
[00:47:31.991 --> 00:47:35.073]  So much of the Drudge Report's traffic is media.
[00:47:35.913 --> 00:47:37.334]  I mean, it really sets the agenda.
[00:47:38.937 --> 00:47:46.785]  And that's why the old line media is dying and the new media, like the Drudge Report, just gets bigger and bigger.
[00:47:47.226 --> 00:47:54.714]  Because Drudge will link to a clip of Herman Van Rompuy calling for world government and defining it as a banking dictatorship.
[00:47:58.211 --> 00:48:00.833]  Drudge will link to Gordon Brown calling for world government.
[00:48:01.094 --> 00:48:02.915]  He will link to Obama calling for it.
[00:48:03.516 --> 00:48:11.162]  I mean, you got Chris Matthews saying none of this exists out of one side of his mouth, while all these world leaders and the UN are setting up world government.
[00:48:11.442 --> 00:48:14.045]  Well, Drudge just says, hey, the emperor's wearing no clothes.
[00:48:15.029 --> 00:48:18.312]  That's what Infowars.com is and presentmoney.com is.
[00:48:19.293 --> 00:48:21.515]  We're like the three-year-old in the parade.
[00:48:21.755 --> 00:48:23.396]  Here comes the king, butt naked.
[00:48:23.416 --> 00:48:25.778]  No one wants to say he's naked.
[00:48:26.078 --> 00:48:28.981]  And the three-year-old steps forward and says, the emperor is naked.
[00:48:30.062 --> 00:48:30.382]  And so...
[00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:36.237]  We appreciate the Drudge Report because they're helping us reach a lot of new people.
[00:48:37.018 --> 00:48:38.700]  I also want to thank Coast to Coast AM.
[00:48:39.141 --> 00:48:44.508]  They've been instrumental in the last six and a half, seven years, having me on, reaching tens of millions.
[00:48:44.528 --> 00:48:47.032]  They have 16 million listeners, conservatively.
[00:48:50.236 --> 00:48:52.617]  So they've helped us reach a lot of new people.
[00:48:52.717 --> 00:48:56.560]  We're very thankful to Coast to Coast AM and George Norring for his courage on that front.
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:00.642]  And you can say what you want about Drudge, you can say what you want about George Norring, you can say what you want about me.
[00:49:01.082 --> 00:49:07.966]  You know, we all are appealing to, you know, different types of audiences, but we're all mavericks.
[00:49:09.907 --> 00:49:14.570]  We're all, you know, covering things from our perspective and trailblazing.
[00:49:15.622 --> 00:49:20.338]  And I just can't believe that I'm in company with people like Matt Drudge.
[00:49:23.578 --> 00:49:24.619]  Because of my message.
[00:49:24.679 --> 00:49:26.420]  I mean, it is an extreme message.
[00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:30.283]  I mean, we have this article out that I'm begging everyone to get to everyone they know.
[00:49:30.663 --> 00:49:36.427]  MSNBC and cover-up of manifestly provable population control plan.
[00:49:36.707 --> 00:49:40.389]  Because that's the big, you know, the TV show tonight that airs.
[00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:44.972]  What time is the stupid Rise of the Right air that they've been hyping up?
[00:49:45.473 --> 00:49:47.894]  Like it's the new Star Wars movie coming out or something?
[00:49:51.474 --> 00:50:01.778]  It ends saying Alex Jones thinks the government wants to kill us, and in TV newscasts, or TV newscasts they've had building up to this, they keep bringing up the fact that Alex Jones thinks the government wants to kill you.
[00:50:03.178 --> 00:50:14.983]  I don't think anything, Matthews, and you're not stupid, you worked in the White House with Zbigniew Brzezinski, you know full well, in your Georgetown, New York City, uh, you know, type crowds, there in D.C.
[00:50:15.023 --> 00:50:20.605]  and New York, that's all you people talk about, is how we're a bunch of ugly humpback scum that have to be killed.
[00:50:21.445 --> 00:50:22.746]  Yes, I know your nickname for us.
[00:50:23.667 --> 00:50:25.128]  And I've had it.
[00:50:25.148 --> 00:50:26.008]  Okay?
[00:50:26.448 --> 00:50:27.189]  We've had it with you.
[00:50:27.709 --> 00:50:28.490]  We know who you are.
[00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:29.410]  We know your game plan.
[00:50:29.751 --> 00:50:31.552]  You want the future for you and your children.
[00:50:31.792 --> 00:50:32.893]  You don't want us to be in it.
[00:50:33.253 --> 00:50:34.574]  We've got all the government documents.
[00:50:34.894 --> 00:50:36.295]  And your intimidation doesn't work.
[00:50:36.375 --> 00:50:37.676]  Your call's coming up.
[00:50:39.657 --> 00:50:43.960]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:50:50.677 --> 00:50:54.298]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:50:54.638 --> 00:51:02.759]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:51:03.499 --> 00:51:07.540]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:18.942]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:51:19.582 --> 00:51:28.591]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:51:29.091 --> 00:51:34.136]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:51:34.536 --> 00:51:41.703]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:51:42.023 --> 00:51:44.425]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:51:51.952 --> 00:51:53.873]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:54.373 --> 00:51:57.235]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:03.958 --> 00:52:04.618]  Big Brother.
[00:52:05.259 --> 00:52:06.319]  Mainstream media.
[00:52:07.039 --> 00:52:08.180]  Government cover-ups.
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:09.621]  You want answers?
[00:52:10.381 --> 00:52:11.361]  Well, so does he.
[00:52:11.922 --> 00:52:15.804]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:16.124 --> 00:52:20.166]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:52:23.308 --> 00:52:29.410]  Well, when I take three days off, I've got a lot I want to say, a lot I want to talk about.
[00:52:30.791 --> 00:52:35.093]  But now we're going to take your calls, John, Chad, Tim, Jim, Ruben, and others.
[00:52:35.713 --> 00:52:38.414]  We'll continue with open phones in the fourth hour today.
[00:52:41.553 --> 00:52:43.615]  And I've only scratched the surface on the news.
[00:52:44.776 --> 00:52:51.641]  Coming up, I will get to it, I will play Chris Matthews last night with Pat Buchanan, trying to demonize Pat Buchanan and myself.
[00:52:52.622 --> 00:52:55.765]  And some of the ways they came at us, I want to analyze that.
[00:52:55.785 --> 00:52:59.368]  And then I am going to get more into the oil spill and my take on it.
[00:53:00.028 --> 00:53:01.470]  But let's go to John in Ohio.
[00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:03.271]  John, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[00:53:03.812 --> 00:53:08.896]  Hey Alex, you know, anymore, as much as I'm reading, and I was just like you, I was basically
[00:53:09.372 --> 00:53:18.116]  Kind of conservative libertarian when I was like 19 or 20, but the more I read and the more I've understood it, I said, this isn't the United States of America anymore.
[00:53:18.136 --> 00:53:21.678]  This is the United Colonies of Great Britain under that queen over there.
[00:53:22.278 --> 00:53:31.242]  She is basically, her and her banking minions have pretty much bought out our money supply since 1913, and they've consolidated more and more and more.
[00:53:31.815 --> 00:53:38.302]  And now with Barack Obama in there, who is by their law a British subject, she pretty much has us by the short hairs.
[00:53:39.083 --> 00:53:45.771]  Well, we're going to get John Coleman back on, who was in British intelligence and who was, of course, a constitutional lawyer.
[00:53:47.092 --> 00:53:51.474]  Not the British people, but the British Empire system and that wealth.
[00:53:51.814 --> 00:53:53.374]  The sun never set on the British Empire.
[00:53:53.654 --> 00:53:59.877]  When the British Empire started getting resistance, they just took their flag down, but used their covert corporate governance.
[00:54:00.317 --> 00:54:02.317]  That's what Carol Quigley at Georgetown said.
[00:54:02.618 --> 00:54:04.458]  That's what Zygmunt Brzezinski says.
[00:54:04.858 --> 00:54:07.439]  That's what Helmut Schmidt, the former German Chancellor, said.
[00:54:07.919 --> 00:54:14.822]  That's what the Japanese leaders... I mean, they all say the British corporate model dominates the earth.
[00:54:15.362 --> 00:54:21.083]  You've got the Israeli stripe in there, because the founders of Israel, the Rothschilds, are also a big part of the British Empire.
[00:54:21.683 --> 00:54:29.665]  But it is the Anglo-American-Dutch interest created the model of covert corporate governance.
[00:54:30.265 --> 00:54:33.506]  And that's what we're going into even deeper right now.
[00:54:33.566 --> 00:54:34.166]  It's a great point.
[00:54:34.186 --> 00:54:35.427]  By the way, when's John Coleman on?
[00:54:36.047 --> 00:54:36.907]  Is he back on this week?
[00:54:39.028 --> 00:54:40.528]  Okay, go ahead and finish your point, Caller.
[00:54:41.288 --> 00:54:44.469]  Basically, Alex, I've been reading, I've read a lot of books.
[00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:49.190]  I'm reading this new book about George III, where he said, freedom of speech is a good thing.
[00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:55.051]  Every man in Britain has the right to express themselves, but only within the parameters of the law.
[00:54:55.591 --> 00:54:58.291]  And so I read that, I said, this is what we're headed to.
[00:54:58.431 --> 00:55:03.452]  It's limited freedoms, limited everything, and eventually what they want is no freedom at all.
[00:55:03.472 --> 00:55:06.073]  It's a revocation of Magna Carta and all these other laws.
[00:55:06.093 --> 00:55:07.453]  Yeah, you have a Second Amendment
[00:55:08.413 --> 00:55:12.295]  And the Second Amendment means under law the government can ban it or restrict it down to nothing.
[00:55:12.615 --> 00:55:25.560]  You have a right to free speech, the speech the government says is okay, and now we see open everywhere where the media every day says, we need the police to be able to secretly arrest you and have you disappear.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:31.903]  You know, just like in Rome, take him away, take him to the dungeon, no trial, no nothing.
[00:55:31.963 --> 00:55:37.145]  This is the cornerstone, the fulcrum, the heart
[00:55:38.405 --> 00:55:46.368]  Around which all tyranny orbits is secret arrest, no due process, and they are promoting it as if it is mother's milk.
[00:55:46.448 --> 00:55:49.208]  I mean, how much more obvious does it have to get?
[00:55:49.849 --> 00:55:55.070]  It's ridiculous, Alex, and I just, I think we have just woken up to it in time.
[00:55:55.450 --> 00:55:59.632]  Most of us did not realize that in 1913 that they bought out our currency.
[00:56:00.032 --> 00:56:02.553]  Most of us didn't realize that in 1893, Andrew Carnegie wrote a
[00:56:04.588 --> 00:56:04.869]  I think?
[00:56:23.851 --> 00:56:29.215]  But what they want to do is they want to institute some worldwide pagan religion and bring back these Babylonians.
[00:56:29.235 --> 00:56:30.335]  You're absolutely right.
[00:56:30.376 --> 00:56:36.520]  When they knocked off their cousins in the French Revolution, they went to a ten-day week, nine days of work.
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:37.560]  They changed the months.
[00:56:37.961 --> 00:56:39.782]  They want to overturn the existing order.
[00:56:40.202 --> 00:56:40.903]  And you said it.
[00:56:41.383 --> 00:56:49.169]  Even if they're not the Merovingian line, the Queen of England and all of them on record say they believe they're the Merovingian line, that they are
[00:56:50.029 --> 00:56:55.251]  The, the, the, the, the, the progeny of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene.
[00:56:55.471 --> 00:56:57.392]  They are lunatics who think they're God.
[00:56:58.752 --> 00:57:02.974]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:57:03.294 --> 00:57:03.914]  Number one.
[00:57:04.214 --> 00:57:07.355]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:57:07.635 --> 00:57:08.175]  Number two.
[00:57:08.495 --> 00:57:13.037]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:57:13.377 --> 00:57:13.817]  It's true.
[00:57:14.117 --> 00:57:18.659]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:57:18.979 --> 00:57:19.520]  Number 3.
[00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:23.103]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:57:23.403 --> 00:57:27.126]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:57:27.306 --> 00:57:27.867]  Number 4.
[00:57:28.107 --> 00:57:30.489]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:57:30.869 --> 00:57:34.272]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:57:34.552 --> 00:57:34.773]  Number 5.
[00:57:35.333 --> 00:57:39.256]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:57:39.476 --> 00:57:44.240]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:57:44.540 --> 00:57:48.563]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:57:48.703 --> 00:57:50.284]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:57:58.584 --> 00:58:02.526]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:58:02.766 --> 00:58:08.810]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:16.274]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:58:16.554 --> 00:58:21.097]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:58:21.437 --> 00:58:29.899]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[00:58:30.099 --> 00:58:33.880]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:40.542]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:58:41.102 --> 00:58:44.543]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:58:45.003 --> 00:58:45.423]  Call us.
[00:58:45.863 --> 00:58:46.083]  At 1-800-340-7091.

[00:58:50.565 --> 00:58:50.886]  Thank you.
[00:58:50.906 --> 00:58:55.108]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[00:59:02.512 --> 00:59:03.433]  Tyranny is here.
[00:59:03.773 --> 00:59:07.497]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:59:07.637 --> 00:59:09.920]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:15.386]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:59:15.806 --> 00:59:22.053]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:59:22.453 --> 00:59:27.997]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:59:28.437 --> 00:59:32.120]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:36.623]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:59:36.903 --> 00:59:42.407]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:59:42.848 --> 00:59:45.850]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:59:46.410 --> 00:59:47.851]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:59:48.391 --> 00:59:48.812]  It's here.

[00:59:59.336 --> 01:00:07.058]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:00:07.078 --> 01:00:11.060]  Okay, I got a long way to go and a short time to get there.
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:17.122]  We're two hours, three hours into the broadcast and I haven't even
[01:00:21.337 --> 01:00:27.443]  I haven't even gotten to Chris Matthews and his demonization piece.
[01:00:27.963 --> 01:00:32.607]  We talked about it some last week when somebody inside MSNBC was concerned, sent us the script.
[01:00:32.948 --> 01:00:35.410]  We've seen promos now for The Rise of the Right.
[01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:37.252]  That's going to air three times today.
[01:00:37.992 --> 01:00:38.793]  Three times.
[01:00:38.933 --> 01:00:41.415]  What, at 5, 7 and midnight Eastern?
[01:00:42.396 --> 01:00:43.397]  On MSNBC.
[01:00:43.857 --> 01:00:46.239]  And it's exactly what we thought it would be, and more.
[01:00:46.619 --> 01:00:49.542]  So that's coming up, and I want to give you my skinny on the oil spill.
[01:00:49.942 --> 01:00:54.806]  Obama is now saying $20 billion to be paid by BP, that they're going to pay all of it.
[01:00:55.346 --> 01:00:56.207]  I don't believe any of that.
[01:00:56.227 --> 01:00:58.208]  They're one of his biggest campaign contributors.
[01:00:58.689 --> 01:01:04.373]  Just like last year in the stimulus bill, Obama said, I'm against CEOs getting bailout money.
[01:01:04.954 --> 01:01:10.058]  Then he pressured Senator Dodd, and Dodd released these emails from the White House,
[01:01:11.553 --> 01:01:33.021]  To add a provision where retroactively all the big companies, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Warren Buffets, Wells Fargo, Citibank, all of them, got to retroactively keep all the bonuses and bonuses going forward and that some small companies had to be under the regulations.
[01:01:34.081 --> 01:01:35.442]  Again, unfair trade practices.
[01:01:38.117 --> 01:01:42.460]  That's what the Banking Association has also said about the new banking bill that just passed here in Texas.
[01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:50.405]  Our Banking Association, the president of it, said, this is the groups that sold derivatives, this is the big criminal mega-banks, we're healthy banks, this allows them to take us over.
[01:01:50.765 --> 01:02:07.015]  And what do you see federal regulators do, filled with Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, former execs, who all hold stock in these companies, like Congress does, many members of Congress, just gobbling up as fast as they can healthy banks and insurance companies and credit unions.
[01:02:11.385 --> 01:02:15.647]  So when Obama says, I'm going to get tough, he knows you'll forget about this in six months, a year.
[01:02:17.268 --> 01:02:19.068]  Look for the taxpayer to pay for it.
[01:02:19.148 --> 01:02:21.469]  And we know that's what green taxes mean.
[01:02:22.310 --> 01:02:22.890]  Green energy.
[01:02:23.170 --> 01:02:25.271]  Oh, we need to have that carbon tax.
[01:02:25.311 --> 01:02:26.892]  We need to have a fuel oil tax.
[01:02:27.212 --> 01:02:34.395]  We need to have a wellhead tax, a car tax, a gas tax on propane, on natural gas.
[01:02:35.868 --> 01:02:37.069]  That's what's in his plan.
[01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:43.355]  He said, my plan through the EPA, separate from the Senate passing it, is what the House passed.
[01:02:44.697 --> 01:02:48.060]  That is cap-and-trade, which is what BP always wanted.
[01:02:48.501 --> 01:02:51.544]  And now you know the BP CEO dumped his stock at record levels.
[01:02:51.864 --> 01:02:54.527]  You know Goldman Sachs that was chairing BP.
[01:02:55.628 --> 01:02:57.570]  The head of BP was co-chairing.
[01:02:59.534 --> 01:03:03.659]  The head of Goldman Sachs was co-chairing BP, and the list goes on and on.
[01:03:03.819 --> 01:03:15.912]  Inside job, inside job, blocking the response by the states, blocking the response by private corporations, blocking the response by foreign governments, letting the oil get into shore, and then not capping it.
[01:03:16.213 --> 01:03:20.778]  They're going to let that thing leak until they get your money.
[01:03:22.472 --> 01:03:24.554]  And the public's been sucked into whining about it.
[01:03:24.574 --> 01:03:25.555]  Oh, I'm still angry.
[01:03:25.615 --> 01:03:26.615]  Do something, Obama!
[01:03:26.655 --> 01:03:27.196]  Do something!
[01:03:27.216 --> 01:03:28.897]  And they're like, you want us to do something?
[01:03:28.937 --> 01:03:29.298]  We will.
[01:03:29.598 --> 01:03:30.138]  Are you sure?
[01:03:30.759 --> 01:03:32.080]  We're going to put a tax on you.
[01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:35.302]  To BP that set up the carbon tax.
[01:03:35.502 --> 01:03:38.725]  We'll have you pay taxes to the subsidiary banks of BP.
[01:03:38.765 --> 01:03:39.366]  That'll show them.
[01:03:39.566 --> 01:03:40.066]  That's right!
[01:03:40.106 --> 01:03:41.287]  You show them, Obama!
[01:03:41.567 --> 01:03:43.189]  You get tough with him right now!
[01:03:46.837 --> 01:03:48.178]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[01:03:48.199 --> 01:03:49.160]  They create the crisis.
[01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:50.761]  The public gets all upset about it.
[01:03:50.982 --> 01:03:53.765]  The media says, what are they going to do about it?
[01:03:53.985 --> 01:03:55.206]  Meaning the mainstream media.
[01:03:55.607 --> 01:04:00.012]  The mainstream media says, what are they going to do about it to the government?
[01:04:01.007 --> 01:04:04.089]  And the government says, we'll put taxes on you and take all your rights.
[01:04:04.109 --> 01:04:15.916]  Kind of like Obama had one of his people on Fox News this morning, one of his spokesmen saying, just like at 9-11, we didn't like it happening, but we used it to get freedom in America and to protect the people from terrorists.
[01:04:15.956 --> 01:04:16.716]  Take all your freedom.
[01:04:17.116 --> 01:04:17.877]  Giving you your freedom.
[01:04:17.917 --> 01:04:18.617]  The Patriot Act.
[01:04:19.358 --> 01:04:20.338]  The New Freedom Initiative.
[01:04:20.358 --> 01:04:21.779]  It always has an Orwellian name.
[01:04:22.299 --> 01:04:26.342]  And so, they're not letting a good crisis go to waste.
[01:04:27.682 --> 01:04:28.863]  Let's go to Chad in Ohio.
[01:04:28.903 --> 01:04:29.604]  Chad, you're on the air.
[01:04:29.644 --> 01:04:29.964]  Go ahead.
[01:04:30.751 --> 01:04:31.251]  Outstanding.
[01:04:31.491 --> 01:04:37.515]  Hey Alex, back in 2009, 2009 of May, I went to renew my license here in Hocking County in Ohio.
[01:04:38.436 --> 01:04:41.457]  They told me my license had been suspended by the state of North Carolina.
[01:04:41.978 --> 01:04:44.339]  So I had to call the state of North Carolina.
[01:04:44.359 --> 01:04:44.839]  I talked to them.
[01:04:44.859 --> 01:04:49.902]  I said, you know, this is Chad, the reason why I was calling is my license was suspended and I want to know why.
[01:04:50.323 --> 01:04:51.984]  Well, they said you had a ticket of February of 2001.
[01:04:52.644 --> 01:04:54.145]  I said, well, I was stationed with the Marine Corps.
[01:04:54.165 --> 01:04:55.986]  I was in the Navy, but I was stationed with the Marines at that time.
[01:04:56.006 --> 01:04:57.087]  I said, that's true.
[01:04:57.147 --> 01:04:57.887]  I paid that ticket.
[01:04:57.947 --> 01:04:58.527]  She looked it up.
[01:04:58.588 --> 01:04:59.328]  She said, yeah, you did.
[01:04:59.850 --> 01:05:00.751]  I said, so what's going on?
[01:05:00.791 --> 01:05:06.895]  She said, well, the Department of Motor Vehicles of North Carolina gave you another traffic violation for driving 20 miles over the speed limit.
[01:05:07.435 --> 01:05:10.077]  And I said, you know, I've never been told about this.
[01:05:10.157 --> 01:05:15.281]  I said, so what you're telling me is after eight years and renewing my license twice in eight years, you're just now telling me about this?
[01:05:16.142 --> 01:05:21.345]  And she wouldn't tell me what was going on, but I did my research, and what I found out was about the Real ID Act.
[01:05:22.146 --> 01:05:29.251]  And I'm even a government employee, and they're starting to, well, not starting, but they're putting those boxes in the ceilings to where
[01:05:29.761 --> 01:05:33.109]  When you walk in, a radio wave comes in, hits your card, and goes back.
[01:05:33.550 --> 01:05:39.104]  But here, ultimately, the fact of it is, is that the state of Ohio is now issuing a national ID card.
[01:05:39.684 --> 01:05:42.025]  Of course they went to a new enhanced driver's license.
[01:05:42.045 --> 01:05:48.708]  Yeah, for those that don't know, for those that don't know, I get questions all the time about how did you get your driver's license?
[01:05:48.748 --> 01:05:54.530]  Because I famously got arrested refusing the thumbprint in Austin, Texas in 1997.
[01:05:54.570 --> 01:06:01.773]  I had the executive order about how it was a national ID card, how they were going to use it for buying and selling, how they were going to track everything we did.
[01:06:02.073 --> 01:06:07.135]  They said ultimately in the executive order, they're going to take our blood at the driver's license facility.
[01:06:07.155 --> 01:06:08.956]  That's why they're getting you trained right now with cops.
[01:06:09.816 --> 01:06:16.579]  And license plate reading cameras have already given everybody tickets for speeding.
[01:06:17.399 --> 01:06:26.103]  And what they're now going to phase in is points on your license and most Americans in the next year or two are going to be told you no longer have your driver's license.
[01:06:26.443 --> 01:06:33.466]  You have hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines with interest for all these hundreds and hundreds of times you were caught speeding.
[01:06:33.826 --> 01:06:35.027]  Camera at point A
[01:06:36.221 --> 01:06:57.599]  said that you went from point A to camera point B at an average speed of 81 miles an hour and so you're going to be given tickets and again the pentagon put in the the license plate readers fifteen years ago for at least ten years it's going into federal databases uh... anybody who didn't have insurance one of my employees uh... nine years ago didn't have insurance
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:25.850]  uh... he was given uh... a ticket he paid for it they don't care they suspended his license for a month they said you gotta pay all these giant fines retroactively and come in and prove you have insurance now but the illegals are above the law they're released so this cashless system is already in and they're already tracking the slaves everywhere they go and so that's probably how you got that ticket even though you don't remember being pulled over by a cop go ahead and so now
[01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:33.153]  They're also saying under the Real ID, and I have my Texas driver's license, I went ahead and got one, because I couldn't get on airplanes, I couldn't live.
[01:07:33.173 --> 01:07:37.016]  You know, I mean, I'm inside Nazi Germany, and people ask, why do I have my Nazi papers?
[01:07:37.316 --> 01:07:39.377]  Well, because I have to be able to move around in the resistance.
[01:07:39.397 --> 01:07:44.600]  If I don't have it, I'll get picked up even quicker, because I'm not an illegal alien who's above the law, part of their program.
[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:46.881]  And it says, USA, Texas.
[01:07:47.401 --> 01:07:55.993]  And it's a National ID card and it's got National ID barcode on the back and it's just a glorified Federal ID and it tracks everything I do.
[01:07:56.474 --> 01:07:58.497]  And this is my slave control card.
[01:07:58.918 --> 01:08:00.159]  And they've now said...
[01:08:01.212 --> 01:08:09.776]  That when your license gets suspended, you're going to be automatically fired from your job, and there's going to be tens of thousands of dollars of fines a month.
[01:08:10.296 --> 01:08:12.037]  See, they're not going to ever bust the illegals.
[01:08:12.057 --> 01:08:18.140]  You're going to have to have an ID card to have a job, and if you haven't paid taxes, they're not going to allow you to have a job.
[01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:28.064]  You've got to voluntarily go turn yourself in on a work release program for forced labor, but it's to pay the taxes, quote, so it's not forced labor, to the government.
[01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:29.925]  This is high-tech slavery.
[01:08:30.305 --> 01:08:31.566]  Everyone is going to enjoy it.
[01:08:31.766 --> 01:08:32.367]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:08:33.227 --> 01:08:34.948]  Oh, well, number one, you're absolutely right.
[01:08:35.649 --> 01:08:42.834]  Our driver's license here in the state of Ohio, pay attention to people in Ohio, do say USA driver's license, and they just started that within a year and a half.
[01:08:43.374 --> 01:08:45.535]  Again, I didn't know any of this until 2009.
[01:08:46.276 --> 01:08:55.162]  Also, in my county, they started already putting, well, they did, they put license plate scanners on the back of their cop cruisers and the sheriff cruisers.
[01:08:55.569 --> 01:08:59.252]  I actually went in and I took a Vietnam veteran, two Purple Hearts, in there with me.
[01:08:59.933 --> 01:09:01.715]  Asked him who purchased those.
[01:09:01.755 --> 01:09:03.596]  He told me the Department of Homeland Security.
[01:09:04.017 --> 01:09:10.142]  I asked him who, uh, are those for... Yeah, but you don't bring a veteran in with Purple Hearts if those cops have been brainwashed.
[01:09:10.462 --> 01:09:11.704]  That means you're bad.
[01:09:12.024 --> 01:09:13.805]  It doesn't, it's not good to be a veteran anymore.
[01:09:13.825 --> 01:09:20.952]  According to their Homeland Security training, that veteran is a potential terrorist who's trying to stop them from taking all the money to the banks.
[01:09:20.992 --> 01:09:21.893]  But, sorry, go ahead.
[01:09:22.608 --> 01:09:23.728]  No, you're right, brother.
[01:09:23.748 --> 01:09:33.672]  Well, I'm a veteran, too, and I just wanted him to know what was going on, actually, if you ever knew about the REAL ID Act.
[01:09:33.933 --> 01:09:38.334]  And also, I showed him my old military license because they never take it back from you.
[01:09:38.354 --> 01:09:39.995]  They conveniently allow you to leave with it.
[01:09:40.415 --> 01:09:46.238]  But what's happening is now in our federal, even our federal government positions, people are getting issued new ID badges
[01:09:47.757 --> 01:09:52.167]  What they're doing is the government is setting up actual things in the ceilings to send off radio waves.
[01:09:52.248 --> 01:09:53.450]  It's happening here in Ohio.
[01:09:54.333 --> 01:09:54.874]  It's a fact.
[01:09:55.513 --> 01:09:57.053]  Uh, what it is, it's a tracking device.
[01:09:57.093 --> 01:09:58.294]  Just imagine if you were at a gun show.
[01:09:58.314 --> 01:09:59.114]  No, no, no, listen, listen.
[01:09:59.134 --> 01:09:59.994]  That's the whole point.
[01:10:00.174 --> 01:10:05.615]  Of course there's RFID in the passports, in the driver's license, and the government is putting readers up.
[01:10:05.655 --> 01:10:12.156]  They were caught 12 years ago in San Francisco, uh, with their, uh, because they had a test there with some of their license that had it.
[01:10:12.656 --> 01:10:17.137]  And now everywhere they ping and they read everywhere you're going, sir.
[01:10:17.477 --> 01:10:19.678]  So of course, I mean, you're a prisoner.
[01:10:19.718 --> 01:10:20.118]  Continue.
[01:10:20.984 --> 01:10:23.345]  Well, uh, I decided to do something about it.
[01:10:23.646 --> 01:10:29.329]  I'm done tired of, uh, you know, I never really got on my TV, but I was naive for many years of, like I said, I was in the military.
[01:10:29.429 --> 01:10:32.491]  I've seen things that I probably shouldn't have seen and heard.
[01:10:32.991 --> 01:10:39.435]  Uh, but that's beside the fact that the real fact of it is, is that American people really need to stand up for themselves and actually do something.
[01:10:39.935 --> 01:10:42.277]  Uh, a lot of apathy and people just talk.
[01:10:42.917 --> 01:10:45.659]  And, uh, so I decided to run for a state house representative.
[01:10:46.321 --> 01:10:47.822]  And I'd love to give you my website.
[01:10:48.162 --> 01:10:49.543]  Yeah, go ahead and give it to us.
[01:10:49.863 --> 01:10:56.767]  Yeah, it's www.ricketts, R-I-C-K-E-T-T-S, forstaterep.com.
[01:10:57.267 --> 01:11:00.769]  And that's where I'm running under a libertarian ticket.
[01:11:00.829 --> 01:11:04.811]  The Republican Party in my county told me that the Democrats are doing a pretty good job.
[01:11:05.251 --> 01:11:10.214]  So that right there was a telltale sign that says, hey, there's serious issues in this county.
[01:11:11.054 --> 01:11:13.896]  Not only in my county, but there's Illuminati set up everywhere.
[01:11:14.523 --> 01:11:17.510]  And it's really time for people to just wake up.
[01:11:17.730 --> 01:11:19.073]  We need some leadership, honestly.
[01:11:19.614 --> 01:11:22.481]  And I'm not going to be able to do it all myself, of course not.
[01:11:22.701 --> 01:11:24.465]  Alex Jones will not be able to do it all himself.
[01:11:24.943 --> 01:11:27.766]  But the fact of it is, is we need people just to get involved.
[01:11:28.246 --> 01:11:29.147]  Especially in Ohio.
[01:11:29.467 --> 01:11:29.747]  We do.
[01:11:29.787 --> 01:11:30.188]  We do.
[01:11:30.268 --> 01:11:35.392]  Because, again, we're individually all being isolated and this control grid's being put in.
[01:11:35.693 --> 01:11:45.221]  We must recognize this grid is being put in to rob the daylights out of us and militarily suppress us so this crime can be expanded and committed.
[01:11:45.982 --> 01:11:46.343]  I mean, look.
[01:11:46.563 --> 01:11:47.305]  Look at this article.
[01:11:47.365 --> 01:11:48.527]  And I've seen the court documents.
[01:11:48.547 --> 01:11:50.350]  We've been talking to Bruno for the last week and a half.
[01:11:50.771 --> 01:11:51.833]  We Are Change L.A.
[01:11:51.933 --> 01:11:56.341]  organizer faces terrorist charge for facial expressions in court.
[01:11:59.471 --> 01:12:00.732]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:12:00.772 --> 01:12:06.138]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:12:06.378 --> 01:12:10.982]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:12:11.383 --> 01:12:11.783]  It's true.
[01:12:11.863 --> 01:12:16.468]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:12:16.968 --> 01:12:21.673]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:12:22.193 --> 01:12:24.055]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:12:24.488 --> 01:12:29.089]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[01:12:29.289 --> 01:12:30.190]  And here's the best part.
[01:12:30.410 --> 01:12:33.170]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:12:33.471 --> 01:12:36.771]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:12:37.092 --> 01:12:39.932]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:12:40.292 --> 01:12:42.173]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:12:42.513 --> 01:12:43.373]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:12:43.393 --> 01:12:43.613]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:12:50.792 --> 01:12:55.815]  0365.
[01:12:51.312 --> 01:12:55.815]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:12:56.135 --> 01:12:58.597]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:13:00.759 --> 01:13:06.482]  The fall of America and the Western world is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.

[01:13:59.161 --> 01:13:59.561]  Good day.
[01:13:59.722 --> 01:14:01.103]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:14:01.343 --> 01:14:01.563]  June 16, 2010.
[01:14:01.643 --> 01:14:02.784]  Gold opened this morning at $12.3540.
[01:14:02.824 --> 01:14:05.987]  A 1-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $12.6827, $6.3413 for a half-ounce, or $3.1707 for the quarter-ounce.
[01:14:06.027 --> 01:14:06.788]  That's $12.6827, $6.3413, and $3.1707.
[01:14:18.812 --> 01:14:21.474]  Making the right decision is a challenge to investors.
[01:14:21.694 --> 01:14:25.617]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or worse, depression?
[01:14:25.957 --> 01:14:30.580]  Many investors are turning to gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:14:30.841 --> 01:14:36.945]  Midas has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks,
[01:14:37.265 --> 01:14:41.349]  The book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:45.594]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.

[01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:52.400]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:14:59.287 --> 01:15:00.888]  Normal blood pressure, naturally.
[01:15:01.048 --> 01:15:02.168]  How would that make you feel?
[01:15:02.388 --> 01:15:03.769]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[01:15:04.109 --> 01:15:06.390]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[01:15:06.650 --> 01:15:13.933]  Then my real health began going downhill, and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[01:15:14.213 --> 01:15:15.574]  I was a mess, pretty much.
[01:15:15.714 --> 01:15:18.375]  Don reports dramatic improvements with heart and body extract.
[01:15:18.475 --> 01:15:23.517]  I started taking heart and body extract, and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better.
[01:15:23.777 --> 01:15:28.839]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[01:15:28.999 --> 01:15:33.881]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.
[01:15:34.101 --> 01:15:38.142]  Order at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[01:15:38.523 --> 01:15:43.544]  That's HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[01:15:43.805 --> 01:15:46.566]  Folks, I did not expect this at all.
[01:15:46.586 --> 01:15:51.287]  By the 7th, 8th, and 9th day, I saw dramatic improvements from taking Heart and Body Extract.
[01:15:51.307 --> 01:15:55.489]  Details at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[01:16:06.886 --> 01:16:11.910]  Alright, let's continue with your phone calls.
[01:16:11.930 --> 01:16:16.514]  Then we're going to look at Fed manipulations in the crosshairs.
[01:16:16.554 --> 01:16:22.839]  An article written by Alex Newman for the New American Magazine dealing with the ways that the private Federal Reserve Network
[01:16:23.459 --> 01:16:31.124]  ...has a rigged economy here in the United States, and I will get to that Chris Matthews video from last night, dealing with his hit piece.
[01:16:32.044 --> 01:16:35.386]  But right now, let's go ahead and talk to Tim in Oregon.
[01:16:35.726 --> 01:16:36.527]  Tim, you're on the air.
[01:16:36.587 --> 01:16:36.947]  Welcome.
[01:16:38.768 --> 01:16:39.048]  Hello.
[01:16:39.349 --> 01:16:39.629]  Yes, sir.
[01:16:40.369 --> 01:16:43.471]  Yeah, I have just a few quick questions, and I won't take up much of your time.
[01:16:43.491 --> 01:16:50.916]  I was curious if you had any conclusive coverage on the oil spill, like an Internet database of real-time evidence video.
[01:16:52.102 --> 01:16:53.583]  Or anything that anybody can now look up?
[01:16:54.724 --> 01:17:05.093]  Well, I mean, there's video of it gushing 60,000 gallons a day, they say now, and them lying from day one, saying it was a few thousand gallons, then 10,000, then 20,000, then 30,000, then 40,000, then 50,000, then 60,000.
[01:17:05.233 --> 01:17:09.197]  And there's the fact that I do, anybody can pull up the mainstream articles, that 44% of BP stock
[01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:18.720]  I think so.
[01:17:34.446 --> 01:17:35.567]  I don't think so.
[01:17:59.554 --> 01:18:06.717]  Well, no, I'm just necessarily looking for ordinary citizens to just look and witness the devastation in real time.
[01:18:07.077 --> 01:18:08.357]  The devastation?
[01:18:08.477 --> 01:18:21.362]  Well, I mean, they do have goons from Halliburton, BP, trying to keep the media off public beaches, over hundreds of miles of public beaches, trying to stop Americans from seeing the oil spill.
[01:18:21.922 --> 01:18:23.523]  Though, from what I've seen, it's bad.
[01:18:24.483 --> 01:18:33.411]  A lot worse to come because most of it's still out in the ocean in those different currents.
[01:18:34.092 --> 01:18:36.514]  So a lot of it's media hype.
[01:18:37.535 --> 01:18:49.805]  I went to Luby's yesterday and they had big signs saying our food is from the North Atlantic, it's from Alaska, it's from the Northern Pacific, it's from Iceland, it's from all these other places.
[01:18:50.866 --> 01:18:52.407]  Most of the food's good in the Gulf.
[01:18:52.988 --> 01:18:54.429]  I mean, it's just a bunch of hype.
[01:18:54.929 --> 01:19:03.596]  I mean, sure, 50 million gallons sounds like a lot until you realize there's got to be trillions and trillions and trillions of gallons of water in the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:19:04.136 --> 01:19:10.321]  I mean, the oil that's come out of this oil rig is not even a drop of oil in a swimming pool.
[01:19:10.341 --> 01:19:12.563]  Do you understand?
[01:19:13.304 --> 01:19:14.464]  Thank you for that perspective.
[01:19:14.504 --> 01:19:15.125]  I appreciate that.
[01:19:15.505 --> 01:19:17.247]  I also had a few other questions for you.
[01:19:18.857 --> 01:19:26.043]  If martial law takes place, do you think it'll be a coast-to-coast thing, like from the Pacific to the Atlantic, or will it be a state-to-state event?
[01:19:26.883 --> 01:19:28.304]  Okay, we're under martial law.
[01:19:28.424 --> 01:19:31.346]  Police all over the country take blood without warrants at checkpoints.
[01:19:31.746 --> 01:19:35.689]  All babies for 38 years have had their blood secretly taken at birth and put in a Pentagon database.
[01:19:35.909 --> 01:19:36.730]  That's martial law.
[01:19:37.010 --> 01:19:42.673]  The military's been trained for over 30 years in covert operations with local police to take on American gun owners.
[01:19:42.994 --> 01:19:43.854]  That's martial law.
[01:19:44.274 --> 01:19:51.539]  Over 50,000 clergy have been trained on what to preach to their flock, to submit to government, and to hand in their guns.
[01:19:51.599 --> 01:19:53.841]  That's creepy, you know, martial law.
[01:19:54.841 --> 01:19:58.925]  You know, that's like the TV show V, but it's not aliens infiltrating, it's our own people.
[01:19:59.705 --> 01:20:00.926]  I mean, this is tyranny.
[01:20:01.767 --> 01:20:09.313]  Face scanning cameras, license plate reading cameras, a government that secretly arrests citizens, that's martial law.
[01:20:10.074 --> 01:20:13.416]  So, it's what increment of martial law will we be under?
[01:20:13.697 --> 01:20:22.283]  Will they have some hot martial law, like Katrina, where they confiscate guns and things like that?
[01:20:23.291 --> 01:20:24.313]  I mean, you know, that's the question.
[01:20:25.114 --> 01:20:25.816]  That is the question.
[01:20:25.836 --> 01:20:33.210]  So it would be more of an event type situation versus just a state-to-state sweep, you're thinking?
[01:20:34.468 --> 01:20:36.489]  Well, I mean, they already have state-to-state sweeps.
[01:20:37.330 --> 01:20:45.754]  I've got all these squad car videos where they have a checkpoint, they're searching people's papers, and they happen to see a pocket Constitution in the front seat, and they take the woman off.
[01:20:46.255 --> 01:20:49.496]  Instead of being Jewish, like in Nazi Germany, she's a patriot.
[01:20:49.997 --> 01:20:59.122]  And the cops are so brainwashed, they think George Washington, they think a Constitution with George Washington's face on it is as scary as Satan.
[01:21:00.142 --> 01:21:02.264]  And so what I'm saying is, it's martial law,
[01:21:03.444 --> 01:21:14.251]  When Henry Paulson in closed-door session of Congress said, martial law will be declared, blood in the streets, quote, this is on record, if you don't give us unlimited trillions.
[01:21:15.291 --> 01:21:18.654]  So see, martial law is when they launch illegal wars.
[01:21:18.714 --> 01:21:18.894]  I mean,
[01:21:20.091 --> 01:21:25.375]  Nazi Germany was under martial law by 1933 when Hitler firebombed his own capital.
[01:21:25.716 --> 01:21:26.957]  They didn't announce martial law.
[01:21:26.997 --> 01:21:27.938]  It's called security.
[01:21:28.198 --> 01:21:30.480]  They don't call it martial law in North Korea.
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:32.221]  It's just tyranny.
[01:21:32.982 --> 01:21:33.962]  I mean, do you see what I'm saying?
[01:21:34.022 --> 01:21:41.569]  But they could set off a nuke and declare national emergency and maybe even use the term martial law just to throw it in our face.
[01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:47.554]  So that would come after the globalists set off a nuke and blamed it on one of their made-up enemies.
[01:21:47.914 --> 01:21:48.935]  I hope that answers your questions.
[01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:52.524]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[01:23:58.939 --> 01:24:01.542]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:24:01.942 --> 01:24:06.907]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:24:07.267 --> 01:24:09.009]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:24:09.329 --> 01:24:14.134]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:24:14.314 --> 01:24:15.295]  How much do you want?
[01:24:15.516 --> 01:24:16.256]  When do you want it?
[01:24:16.637 --> 01:24:18.238]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:24:18.518 --> 01:24:19.339]  When will you need it?
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:21.662]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:24:21.802 --> 01:24:22.783]  Will there be any food?
[01:24:23.123 --> 01:24:27.025]  Will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself?
[01:24:27.185 --> 01:24:29.706]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:24:29.906 --> 01:24:33.088]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:24:33.508 --> 01:24:36.989]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:38.290]  How much will you need?
[01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:39.150]  We don't know.
[01:24:39.451 --> 01:24:40.351]  How much do you want?
[01:24:40.551 --> 01:24:41.271]  All you can get.
[01:24:41.492 --> 01:24:42.292]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:24:42.572 --> 01:24:45.334]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:24:45.615 --> 01:24:48.737]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:24:48.757 --> 01:24:49.258]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:25:03.257 --> 01:25:06.419]  They came and took it all away!
[01:25:06.899 --> 01:25:11.201]  Aaron Dice is popping in the last 15 minutes or so.
[01:25:11.242 --> 01:25:20.147]  He's done an analysis of these 76 new population reduction programs that Bill Gates and Melinda Gates are funding.
[01:25:21.347 --> 01:25:24.989]  We'll also have your phone calls continuing in the next hour.
[01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:27.531]  Jim, Ruben, Mike,
[01:25:28.544 --> 01:25:33.507]  Prop Joe, Kevin, and others that are patiently holding, I appreciate you doing that.
[01:25:35.348 --> 01:25:47.275]  And I haven't gotten to it, because there's been so much other news we've covered, but I am going to play a couple short clips from MSNBC where they're calling for Obama to be a dictator, because a dictator can get stuff done.
[01:25:47.355 --> 01:25:50.918]  Man on a white horse, you know, give us Adolf Hitler, he'll fix Deutschland.
[01:25:51.598 --> 01:25:53.219]  Give us Lenin, he'll fix it.
[01:25:53.239 --> 01:25:54.460]  Give us Stalin, he'll fix it.
[01:25:55.489 --> 01:25:56.990]  We know how that ends, don't we?
[01:25:57.090 --> 01:25:58.190]  All because of an oil spill.
[01:25:58.210 --> 01:26:01.752]  We've got to give up all our rights, and don't worry, pay the government new taxes.
[01:26:01.792 --> 01:26:02.893]  That'll show BP.
[01:26:04.654 --> 01:26:11.157]  So I'm going to get into that, and this MSNBC hit piece airing three times tonight, and upwards of 20 times total.
[01:26:11.898 --> 01:26:14.539]  As I talk to MSNBC, they say it'll probably air 20 times.
[01:26:14.939 --> 01:26:16.840]  And MSNBC was completely deceptive.
[01:26:17.781 --> 01:26:19.382]  But what do I do?
[01:26:19.462 --> 01:26:20.982]  Chicken out and not go on Fox?
[01:26:21.062 --> 01:26:22.083]  Not go on CNN?
[01:26:22.423 --> 01:26:23.484]  Not go on MSNBC?
[01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:29.712]  I saw some people criticizing me, even being interviewed for the piece, you know, as if I was bad.
[01:26:29.752 --> 01:26:34.594]  But I noticed those guys all, I've seen some of them go on, you know, MSNBC, CNN.
[01:26:34.874 --> 01:26:36.035]  I mean, what do you expect?
[01:26:36.335 --> 01:26:39.236]  Obviously, it's the enemy, but I'm not going to sit here and cower.
[01:26:39.816 --> 01:26:45.758]  I'll tell you this, though, I refuse to fly to be interviewed by Good Morning America, Fox News, CNN.
[01:26:46.079 --> 01:26:47.819]  They've all tried to fly me to New York.
[01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:50.520]  No, I won't.
[01:26:51.181 --> 01:26:52.461]  Some have tried to fly me to LA.
[01:26:52.521 --> 01:26:53.201]  I will not do it.
[01:26:56.013 --> 01:26:57.014]  I've been in the car.
[01:26:57.034 --> 01:26:59.896]  They'll send a car to pick you up to make sure you get there on time.
[01:27:00.256 --> 01:27:06.100]  Here in Austin, five or six times, and had the person say, okay, it's off and drive me back to my house.
[01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:10.163]  Almost like they're just wasting my time on purpose.
[01:27:10.783 --> 01:27:11.264]  I'm done!
[01:27:11.284 --> 01:27:13.745]  Alright, I'm digressing.
[01:27:14.886 --> 01:27:19.790]  I wanted to get Alex Newman on because he came on to detail evidence of the
[01:27:21.437 --> 01:27:28.121]  Mumbai attack being a government inside job, and now even more has come out in mainstream news that he was a government agent.
[01:27:28.161 --> 01:27:29.782]  That was the headline in the Chicago papers.
[01:27:30.903 --> 01:27:35.886]  And he's also went to Copenhagen and worked on that story last year.
[01:27:36.547 --> 01:27:39.409]  He's got a new story at the newamerican.com.
[01:27:39.929 --> 01:27:45.092]  Fed manipulation in the crosshairs, where he just breaks down how they're rigging almost everything.
[01:27:45.613 --> 01:27:46.834]  I mean, talk about
[01:27:47.797 --> 01:27:48.978]  Unfair advantages.
[01:27:49.018 --> 01:27:51.060]  Talk about a monopoly takeover.
[01:27:52.441 --> 01:27:52.962]  This is it.
[01:27:52.982 --> 01:27:54.823]  So we're going to be talking to him here in just one moment.
[01:27:55.184 --> 01:27:59.708]  First, I wanted to thank some of the sponsors that have made today's radio broadcast possible.
[01:28:00.829 --> 01:28:01.950]  One of them is a Cola Blue.
[01:28:04.986 --> 01:28:08.451]  Okolablue.com, it's an atmospheric water generator.
[01:28:08.631 --> 01:28:13.737]  It grabs water right out of the atmosphere, basically clouds.
[01:28:14.078 --> 01:28:17.062]  Clouds, humidity is everywhere even if you can't see it.
[01:28:17.622 --> 01:28:21.447]  And then it purifies it through 7 to 12 filters depending on which unit you buy.
[01:28:22.168 --> 01:28:26.749]  And they've got units that do seven and a half gallons a day, units that do a thousand gallons a day.
[01:28:27.469 --> 01:28:34.551]  They've got them inexpensive, you know, for a family, right up to stuff that can support a whole army battalion.
[01:28:35.272 --> 01:28:41.513]  So Ecolablue.com, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com, the best, cleanest, purest drinking water out there.
[01:28:41.533 --> 01:28:41.993]  Ecolablue.com or 800-691-6043, 800-691-6043.
[01:28:42.013 --> 01:28:43.814]  And continuing, I want to tell you about
[01:28:52.614 --> 01:28:53.974]  Essential Survival.
[01:28:55.515 --> 01:29:01.636]  If you get hit by a disaster and are injured, are you going to wait around for FEMA to come and take care of you?
[01:29:02.136 --> 01:29:05.557]  Be empowered and get the Essential Oil Survival Kit from Essential Survival.
[01:29:06.217 --> 01:29:13.959]  Essential Survival Therapeutic Grade Essential Oils are straight from Mother Nature's Pharmacy, powerful, concentrated, portable, cost-effective, and they don't expire.
[01:29:14.459 --> 01:29:18.780]  Go to EssentialSurvival.org forward slash InfoWars

[01:29:39.992 --> 01:29:42.153]  My staff just loves these oils and you will too.
[01:29:42.693 --> 01:29:44.955]  Essentialsurvival.org forward slash
[01:29:45.555 --> 01:29:49.397]  InfoWarsAgainstThat, EssentialSurvival.org.
[01:29:49.437 --> 01:29:51.539]  EssentialSurvival.org.
[01:29:52.339 --> 01:29:58.223]  Okay, going to our guest, Alex Newman of The New American.
[01:29:58.723 --> 01:30:01.785]  Alex, you've got the floor for the next 22 minutes we've got left in this hour.
[01:30:01.805 --> 01:30:13.132]  I appreciate you coming on on short notice, but I saw your article dealing with the redistribution of wealth, and I know people understand the Feds are fraud, but your article, speaking to the experts doing the research, really in just
[01:30:14.721 --> 01:30:27.165]  Ten pages or so condenses it down in easy-to-understand language, and it's so important to get this information out to everybody, because this is how this illegitimate New World Order gets all its power, as you know.
[01:30:27.745 --> 01:30:28.766]  So walk us through this.
[01:30:29.807 --> 01:30:31.148]  Well, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[01:30:31.208 --> 01:30:33.430]  And, yeah, basically, it's what you said.
[01:30:33.450 --> 01:30:35.151]  It's this huge scheme.
[01:30:35.592 --> 01:30:42.197]  And so what I did with this story, I started by looking at basically real estate and the stock market.
[01:30:42.597 --> 01:30:50.123]  And I started noticing that the Fed was, you know, printing trillions of dollars and giving it to their friends at the banks.
[01:30:50.223 --> 01:30:59.431]  And, you know, a lot of this is well known now from testimony in Congress and stuff where he was admitting that they printed $500 billion and gave it to foreign central banks so they could give it to their banks.
[01:31:00.057 --> 01:31:00.878]  I think so.
[01:31:10.467 --> 01:31:16.571]  Then, when you start looking even deeper, you see that this gets even worse than what's on the surface, already terrible.
[01:31:16.991 --> 01:31:22.754]  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, you can even check this out on their website, actually, at NewYorkFed.org.
[01:31:23.154 --> 01:31:26.136]  They have information about these front companies that they created.
[01:31:27.157 --> 01:31:29.718]  It was Maiden Lane 1, Maiden Lane 2, and Maiden Lane 3.
[01:31:30.038 --> 01:31:33.961]  They're LLCs, Limited Liability Companies, incorporated in Delaware.
[01:31:34.501 --> 01:31:36.322]  And, essentially, what the Fed did was just
[01:31:37.279 --> 01:31:37.639]  I don't know.
[01:31:56.181 --> 01:31:57.283]  Imagine investors.
[01:31:58.024 --> 01:32:01.809]  The way I came across this story in the first place was a guy called William Pitts.
[01:32:01.849 --> 01:32:04.773]  He's a developer and an investor down in Florida.
[01:32:04.793 --> 01:32:11.282]  He started telling people that he had sold some of his stock in the big financial companies.
[01:32:12.344 --> 01:32:12.924]  We're good to go.
[01:32:26.693 --> 01:32:35.103]  And so instead of making a fortune, which would have been the natural consequence of properly reading the market, you know, real estate was a huge mess.
[01:32:35.143 --> 01:32:35.983]  The banks were a mess.
[01:32:36.524 --> 01:32:41.550]  What happened was the Fed started bailing them all out without any authorization from Congress.
[01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:44.373]  Of course, the Constitution says Congress should allocate money.
[01:32:44.793 --> 01:32:47.997]  But what happened here was the Fed just started bailing out all these companies.
[01:32:48.684 --> 01:32:57.189]  And so investors who properly read the market, who saw what was going on, lost their money and insiders made a fortune because they knew what was going to happen.
[01:32:57.209 --> 01:32:59.110]  They knew what actions the Fed was going to take.
[01:32:59.871 --> 01:33:07.696]  And then from there, you can look at basically any segment of the economy and you see that it's being rigged by the Federal Reserve.
[01:33:08.866 --> 01:33:10.527]  For example, the precious metals market.
[01:33:11.267 --> 01:33:16.809]  A lot has come out in the last few months here, but even before that we had Alan Greenspan in 1998.
[01:33:17.209 --> 01:33:23.352]  He went to Congress and he told them that as the price of gold rises, the central bank is going to lease out increasing quantities.
[01:33:23.832 --> 01:33:29.094]  So basically if the price of gold goes up, the Fed is going to keep it down by leasing out some of its gold.
[01:33:31.149 --> 01:33:32.751]  We're good to go.
[01:33:52.731 --> 01:34:03.875]  For example, Andrew McGuire, he was a metals trader in London, and he came out and flat out said that the Federal Reserve was, through its agents, J.P.
[01:34:03.915 --> 01:34:12.798]  Morgan and so forth, stopping the rise in the prices of gold and silver, and that it was being insulated from many potential losses by the Fed and the taxpayer.
[01:34:13.809 --> 01:34:24.260]  So, again, you know, we have this manipulation in the precious metals market, you have the manipulations in stocks and bonds, and the ways that they're bailing out the banks, it's too many to count.
[01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:31.828]  You have the Fed giving the banks money, and then the banks, the commercial banks, put the money back with the Fed, and the Fed pays them interest.
[01:34:32.348 --> 01:34:33.348]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:34:52.174 --> 01:34:57.036]  They have much higher interest rates than what the Fed is charging right now for commercial banks to borrow from them.
[01:34:57.316 --> 01:35:01.337]  So, basically, they're doing nothing, and they're getting a huge bailout from the Fed.
[01:35:01.357 --> 01:35:02.857]  It's not even a bailout, it's just a theft.
[01:35:03.017 --> 01:35:05.618]  They're just taking money from taxpayers by doing nothing.
[01:35:05.958 --> 01:35:10.280]  By taking money from the Fed at almost no interest, and just loaning it to the U.S.
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:13.781]  government, and making a fortune off of the backs of people who pay their taxes.
[01:35:14.361 --> 01:35:19.342]  So, it's just in so many ways that the Fed is ripping off the American people.
[01:35:19.642 --> 01:35:20.643]  And then when you get past the
[01:35:21.795 --> 01:35:22.195]  We're good.
[01:35:35.245 --> 01:35:40.391]  They're controlling the money supply, aside from being a debt trap, which I'll get to in just a moment.
[01:35:40.871 --> 01:35:49.380]  It creates the boom and bust cycle, and it allows their friends to get rich while Americans, you know, get in debt.
[01:35:49.521 --> 01:35:51.923]  And it's actually, it's a permanent debt.
[01:35:51.963 --> 01:35:56.228]  It's a debt that we can't ever pay back, because when the Fed loans out money,
[01:35:57.313 --> 01:36:01.875]  You're stuck in a situation where you have to pay interest on that money, but they never created the interest.
[01:36:02.356 --> 01:36:08.919]  So, I'm sure a lot of your listeners are familiar with this already, but I mean, you can't emphasize it enough.
[01:36:09.779 --> 01:36:14.261]  It's not that if there was good people running the Fed, this would all be okay.
[01:36:14.581 --> 01:36:15.722]  It's literally a trap.
[01:36:15.782 --> 01:36:19.044]  It's a Ponzi scheme, and it cannot continue indefinitely.
[01:36:19.064 --> 01:36:25.847]  I mean, it'll work as long as they can keep finding new people to keep borrowing new money into the system so that people can pay off the old debt with the old interest.
[01:36:26.267 --> 01:36:29.608]  But when people stop borrowing the money, then you get a collapse.
[01:36:30.908 --> 01:36:35.489]  And, you know, all this printing of money, it's bankrupting Americans through inflation.
[01:36:35.569 --> 01:36:46.411]  When we originally got the Fed, the dollar was worth something like, our dollar today is worth something like five cents compared to the dollar when we originally got the Federal Reserve.
[01:36:46.451 --> 01:36:48.752]  And that's just all a theft against the American people.
[01:36:49.272 --> 01:36:55.013]  And the money goes to finance big government, it goes to finance the wars, and it goes to finance this
[01:36:55.934 --> 01:37:02.338]  Incredible wealth that the elite class has amassed by manipulating the system to its advantage.
[01:37:02.959 --> 01:37:05.781]  It's, you know, it kind of leaves you at a loss for words.
[01:37:05.821 --> 01:37:13.005]  We're, in my opinion, this is one of the single biggest issues that we need to solve if we hope to get America back on the right track.
[01:37:13.025 --> 01:37:17.829]  Because as long as we don't have honest money, we're never going to have a proper economy.
[01:37:17.869 --> 01:37:22.331]  And you can never say we have a free market because they're manipulating the market for money.
[01:37:22.372 --> 01:37:24.393]  That's the most crucial basic
[01:37:25.313 --> 01:37:25.953]  Are you still there, Alex?
[01:37:53.835 --> 01:37:56.859]  Okay, well, we were talking to our guest.
[01:37:56.899 --> 01:38:08.135]  I was sitting there listening to him break everything down in an eloquent fashion, reading along with his article, and we lost him on his phone system.
[01:38:09.236 --> 01:38:17.539]  Or it might have been our phone system, so we'll get Alex Newman back on with us here just as soon as we can.
[01:38:18.179 --> 01:38:21.980]  Again, his article is, Fed Manipulations in the Crosshairs.
[01:38:22.540 --> 01:38:25.481]  And while he's been talking, I've been going over some of the articles I have.
[01:38:26.021 --> 01:38:30.103]  UK Eugenicists Demand We Need a Global Initiative for Population Reduction.
[01:38:30.703 --> 01:38:33.804]  We Need a Global Debate on Population Now, London Independent.
[01:38:35.404 --> 01:38:37.384]  Corporate media follows government orders.
[01:38:39.505 --> 01:38:41.666]  Runs... Excuse me.
[01:38:50.408 --> 01:38:56.949]  Oh, and it rains, it pours, lose our guest, and suddenly... I've got a parched throat here.
[01:38:58.129 --> 01:38:59.910]  Corporate media follows government orders.
[01:39:04.830 --> 01:39:07.311]  Runs defense for the Etheridge assault.
[01:39:08.271 --> 01:39:09.271]  We've been covering that up.
[01:39:09.311 --> 01:39:11.592]  Continuing on the carbon tax front.
[01:39:11.652 --> 01:39:16.073]  Lieberman says pay $1 a day for climate.
[01:39:20.994 --> 01:39:22.554]  Okay, going back to Alex.
[01:39:22.654 --> 01:39:24.435]  Alex, we lost your phone line there.
[01:39:24.475 --> 01:39:25.855]  Please continue where you left off.
[01:39:27.290 --> 01:39:31.915]  Yeah, so, I mean, we're literally in a really bad situation.
[01:39:31.975 --> 01:39:34.818]  Unfortunately, the rest of the world is in this situation with us.
[01:39:34.878 --> 01:39:37.261]  Almost every country has a central bank that operates.
[01:39:37.859 --> 01:39:38.739]  Similarly to ours.
[01:39:39.179 --> 01:39:43.680]  And you know, some people think that the Federal Reserve is a government agency.
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:46.041]  It's really important for people to understand that it's not.
[01:39:46.101 --> 01:39:48.621]  What it is, is a banking cartel.
[01:39:49.042 --> 01:39:59.044]  And I think cartel really is the best word to describe it, because the way it's structured, you have 12 regional Federal Reserve banks, and each one is owned by its member banks.
[01:39:59.084 --> 01:40:00.824]  They're basically shareholders.
[01:40:00.884 --> 01:40:02.325]  And the Federal Reserve admits to this.
[01:40:02.405 --> 01:40:03.625]  Recently, when they were sued by
[01:40:04.205 --> 01:40:10.050]  Bloomberg, Freedom of Information Request, trying to figure out where that $2 trillion in emergency lending went.
[01:40:11.631 --> 01:40:17.877]  The Fed admitted that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York filed a supplementary brief saying, hey, we're a private institution.
[01:40:17.897 --> 01:40:19.538]  We're owned by private shareholders.
[01:40:19.598 --> 01:40:22.000]  Our board members are appointed by our private shareholders.
[01:40:22.321 --> 01:40:23.862]  You can't force us to disclose anything.
[01:40:23.902 --> 01:40:27.485]  We're not subject to the Freedom of Information Act because we're not part of the government.
[01:40:28.215 --> 01:40:31.777]  And so far the courts have not bought that argument.
[01:40:31.817 --> 01:40:34.278]  So Bloomberg is making some progress on the lawsuit.
[01:40:34.578 --> 01:40:35.839]  They won on appeal as well.
[01:40:35.879 --> 01:40:42.562]  The Fed appealed the decision and Bloomberg was successful on the appeal, but the Fed is still refusing to hand over the document.
[01:40:43.022 --> 01:40:44.703]  So that's one component of
[01:40:45.363 --> 01:40:46.004]  We're good.
[01:41:00.734 --> 01:41:09.781]  So, I mean, this figure is so startling that it comes out to about $75,000 per person in the United States, including children.
[01:41:10.841 --> 01:41:19.167]  So, if you can imagine yourself paying back $75,000 for the actions of the Fed, which, you know, they haven't even benefited you.
[01:41:19.227 --> 01:41:24.171]  If anything, they're helping to bankrupt you, and now you're on the line to pay for it all.
[01:41:24.631 --> 01:41:27.292]  So, I mean, this should really outrage people.
[01:41:27.412 --> 01:41:35.335]  I think, like Ron Paul, it's one of the most important issues for us to get our country back on track is to solve this Federal Reserve mess.
[01:41:35.395 --> 01:41:40.117]  We need to get rid of it and we need to institute sound money, you know, without a question.
[01:41:40.477 --> 01:41:46.059]  Gold and silver, in my opinion, are a good way to go and we can have a debate about where to go with money.
[01:41:46.959 --> 01:41:52.201]  I was listening to your interview the other day with, is his name Peter Joseph from Zeitgeist?
[01:41:53.444 --> 01:41:54.485]  Yeah, that was years ago.
[01:41:54.505 --> 01:41:55.805]  Oh, was it?
[01:41:55.845 --> 01:41:56.045]  Yeah.
[01:41:56.486 --> 01:41:59.367]  And, I mean, I don't think that we need to get rid of money.
[01:41:59.427 --> 01:42:10.152]  His argument about if we get, you know, this scarcity thing... His argument is to have a global computer that decides everything, and it is absolute dehumanization.
[01:42:10.593 --> 01:42:12.513]  But it's always packaged.
[01:42:12.714 --> 01:42:14.875]  That's what the collectivists always do, is they package
[01:42:15.675 --> 01:42:17.016]  That's a good time, that's it.
[01:42:36.784 --> 01:42:43.869]  Yeah, let's come back and talk more about your research and what it found with our guest Alex Newman from the New American Magazine.
[01:42:44.370 --> 01:42:47.973]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are the websites.
[01:42:48.293 --> 01:42:55.698]  I'll finish up with your phone calls early in the next hour, then I'm going to get to a news blitz and Chris Matthews' hit piece and my take on the oil spill.
[01:42:55.939 --> 01:42:56.399]  Stay with us.
[01:42:59.982 --> 01:43:03.204]  So you think the massive Gulf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe?
[01:43:03.724 --> 01:43:04.225]  Think again.
[01:43:05.029 --> 01:43:12.492]  Benzene, a toxic gas emitted from crude oil and a known carcinogen, is now airborne traveling hundreds, even thousands of miles inland.
[01:43:12.672 --> 01:43:19.654]  Whether you live near the Gulf or not, benzene and other volatile organic compounds could cause adverse reactions to those living inside your home.
[01:43:19.914 --> 01:43:25.236]  NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, came to airfiltersandpurifiers.com for answers.
[01:43:25.496 --> 01:43:28.137]  On how to clean the air on boats aiding in the Gulf cleanup.
[01:43:28.458 --> 01:43:29.378]  Do what NOAA did.
[01:43:29.578 --> 01:43:33.901]  Contact air filters and purifiers dot com and ask about the Health Mate Plus.

[01:43:59.216 --> 01:44:01.537]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:44:01.597 --> 01:44:03.817]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:44:03.917 --> 01:44:06.678]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:44:07.138 --> 01:44:11.900]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:16.441]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:44:16.741 --> 01:44:19.104]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:44:19.204 --> 01:44:21.627]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:44:21.647 --> 01:44:24.551]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:44:24.891 --> 01:44:32.500]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:44:32.828 --> 01:44:38.093]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:44:38.233 --> 01:44:41.016]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:44:41.076 --> 01:44:44.500]  So it's gonna be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:45.681]  And I got news for you.
[01:44:45.841 --> 01:44:47.142]  You're everyone else.
[01:44:47.182 --> 01:44:48.203]  Invisible Empire.

[01:44:59.190 --> 01:45:01.252]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[01:45:01.532 --> 01:45:01.812]  Hi.
[01:45:02.072 --> 01:45:04.554]  Summer's coming, and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[01:45:04.874 --> 01:45:09.116]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[01:45:09.417 --> 01:45:11.578]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[01:45:11.878 --> 01:45:14.900]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:16.061]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[01:45:16.081 --> 01:45:17.522]  She's my mom and I watched her do it.
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:47.160]  888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:45:47.621 --> 01:45:48.261]  Start now.
[01:45:48.521 --> 01:45:49.481]  Knowledge is power.
[01:45:50.241 --> 01:45:51.081]  Better take action.
[01:45:51.261 --> 01:45:52.281]  I think a storm's coming.
[01:45:59.243 --> 01:46:00.523]  I was a highway man.
[01:46:00.603 --> 01:46:02.384]  Along the coach roads I did ride.
[01:46:11.472 --> 01:46:23.620]  Coming up, new bill gives Obama a kill switch to shut down the internet.
[01:46:23.740 --> 01:46:25.982]  It's a presentplanet.com article.
[01:46:27.183 --> 01:46:31.646]  And it is one of the stories on the Drudge Report today on the right hand side.
[01:46:32.907 --> 01:46:37.710]  Right above a Washington Times article, epidemic growth of net porn cited.
[01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:38.911]  Briefing
[01:46:40.057 --> 01:46:41.238]  Children in danger.
[01:46:41.258 --> 01:46:52.145]  But when you actually read the National Security Strategy, May 2010, it echoes what Cass Sunstein and others have said.
[01:46:52.705 --> 01:46:58.249]  It's criticism of the government is effective and is discrediting the state.
[01:46:58.809 --> 01:47:04.553]  The state is a structure owned by foreign hedge funds, mainly.
[01:47:08.450 --> 01:47:17.194]  I was reading the latest issue of Vanity Fair about one of the heads of the hedge funds who's made over $10 million just in the last few years himself, personally.
[01:47:18.955 --> 01:47:29.100]  And they admitted what he's doing is illegal, but said how great it was he was basically doing it, and how fun it was, and how it's all insider trading, ha ha ha.
[01:47:32.856 --> 01:47:37.339]  So, a few hundred guys can have tens of billions in the bank.
[01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:45.785]  We're going to let them destroy our entire economy, put us all in debt, and then hire a bunch of paramilitary brainwashed police to oppress us.
[01:47:46.165 --> 01:47:47.606]  I mean, that's the new world order.
[01:47:50.468 --> 01:47:56.853]  Just criminals looting everything, and they've got their people in all the regulatory positions, and so that's the end of it.
[01:47:56.893 --> 01:47:57.633]  Just accept it.
[01:47:58.014 --> 01:47:59.515]  No, I'm not going to accept it.
[01:47:59.935 --> 01:48:01.916]  Alex Newman, you know, the good news is
[01:48:03.104 --> 01:48:06.227]  30 plus years of people trying to audit the Fed.
[01:48:06.267 --> 01:48:14.454]  Almost 30 of Ron Paul and his two different visits to Congress when he was in there and then got kicked out and then went back in the mid-90s.
[01:48:15.494 --> 01:48:17.056]  He almost had no co-sponsors.
[01:48:17.416 --> 01:48:19.718]  Now he's got a lot of co-sponsors.
[01:48:19.738 --> 01:48:20.979]  He got it passed out of the House.
[01:48:21.740 --> 01:48:23.941]  It's in the Senate, got derailed.
[01:48:24.642 --> 01:48:32.310]  But the system knows, as Zbigniew Brzezinski said a month ago, that the people are now really awake to their structure.
[01:48:32.650 --> 01:48:38.476]  And it's only a matter of time until they try to remove these parasites.
[01:48:39.717 --> 01:48:44.021]  But the parasites are planning to maintain their control at a barrel of a gun.
[01:48:47.099 --> 01:48:51.722]  Yeah, and like you said, what's going on now in Congress I think is fascinating.
[01:48:51.882 --> 01:48:53.643]  We really have an opportunity right now.
[01:48:53.683 --> 01:48:56.785]  People are so upset and knowledge about this.
[01:48:57.646 --> 01:49:01.428]  I think a criminal syndicate is a good way to put it, this Federal Reserve.
[01:49:01.848 --> 01:49:05.210]  People are really starting to understand it's a bipartisan issue.
[01:49:05.270 --> 01:49:13.776]  Now some of the fiercest critics of the Fed have actually come from the Democratic Party, like Alan Grayson in Florida, and I disagree with his view of
[01:49:14.296 --> 01:49:16.658]  How government should run and what its purpose should be.
[01:49:17.038 --> 01:49:20.000]  But he's done such a good job of hammering on the Fed.
[01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:23.702]  And it just goes to show you that this isn't a partisan issue in any way.
[01:49:23.742 --> 01:49:26.584]  This is an issue that should concern every American.
[01:49:26.664 --> 01:49:32.988]  And every American who isn't on the dole of the big banks or the government should be really concerned about this.
[01:49:33.008 --> 01:49:36.910]  And polls are showing that 80% of the people now want the Fed audited.
[01:49:37.171 --> 01:49:42.414]  So now is really our opportunity in America to fix this problem, to get rid of this
[01:49:43.034 --> 01:49:45.176]  You call them parasites, and I think it's a perfect description.
[01:49:45.216 --> 01:49:51.381]  They're leeching off of the American people's labor, and they're not contributing anything.
[01:49:51.401 --> 01:50:01.029]  They're bankrupting us, they create bubbles, and this pyramid scheme, literally when it collapses, it leaves them in control of everything.
[01:50:01.950 --> 01:50:02.351]  I think so.
[01:50:19.128 --> 01:50:25.433]  The Fed's days are numbered here, because as people realize what's going on, they can't keep it hidden anymore.
[01:50:25.473 --> 01:50:28.756]  This last economic crisis really put it all out in the open.
[01:50:29.176 --> 01:50:31.098]  Congress has caught on to the scheme now.
[01:50:31.598 --> 01:50:34.961]  And, you know, we don't have enough senators yet to get a proper audit of the Fed.
[01:50:35.041 --> 01:50:35.941]  Well, we're gonna get it!
[01:50:36.041 --> 01:50:37.302]  Well said, Alex Newman!
[01:50:37.342 --> 01:50:38.023]  Great job!
[01:50:39.104 --> 01:50:43.007]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:50:43.347 --> 01:50:44.208]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:50:48.575 --> 01:50:52.818]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:50:53.138 --> 01:50:53.759]  Number one.
[01:50:54.039 --> 01:50:57.201]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:50:57.462 --> 01:50:58.042]  Number two.
[01:50:58.342 --> 01:51:02.886]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:51:03.226 --> 01:51:03.666]  It's true.
[01:51:03.966 --> 01:51:08.530]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:51:08.850 --> 01:51:09.390]  Number three.
[01:51:09.671 --> 01:51:12.953]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:51:13.253 --> 01:51:16.956]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:51:17.156 --> 01:51:17.697]  Number 4.
[01:51:17.957 --> 01:51:20.320]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:51:20.700 --> 01:51:24.104]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:51:24.384 --> 01:51:24.604]  Number 5.
[01:51:25.185 --> 01:51:29.109]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:51:29.330 --> 01:51:34.095]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:51:34.375 --> 01:51:38.396]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:51:38.536 --> 01:51:40.117]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:51:40.337 --> 01:51:42.418]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:51:42.578 --> 01:51:45.179]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:51:45.199 --> 01:51:46.539]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:51:46.559 --> 01:51:52.141]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:52:06.497 --> 01:52:07.998]  All right, here's the game plan.
[01:52:08.018 --> 01:52:11.441]  We're now into the final hour and I'm way behind.
[01:52:11.461 --> 01:52:15.024]  I got a lot of news to cover, a lot of video clips to play, and a short time to get there.
[01:52:15.205 --> 01:52:23.092]  Talking to Dr. Reuben Mike, Krop, Kevin Mark, and others right now.
[01:52:24.845 --> 01:52:31.187]  And then I'm going to get into all the news we haven't covered and recap some of the top stories as well in this final hour.
[01:52:31.207 --> 01:52:40.650]  Aaron Dykes is going to pop in the last 15 minutes with our research on the latest activities, the Bill & Melinda Gates World Population Reduction information.
[01:52:41.870 --> 01:52:43.951]  And of course, I haven't gotten into Chris Matthews.
[01:52:43.991 --> 01:52:46.631]  I've mentioned it some with the big hit piece they're airing tonight.
[01:52:47.092 --> 01:52:49.312]  Yours truly is the finale of the program.
[01:52:49.932 --> 01:52:56.274]  And in the last few nights, he's been foreshadowing that I'm this dangerous radical who's endangering everybody.
[01:52:56.794 --> 01:52:57.554]  So that's coming up.
[01:52:57.914 --> 01:53:00.355]  Right now, let's go to Ruben in Connecticut.
[01:53:00.655 --> 01:53:01.575]  Ruben, thanks for holding.
[01:53:01.595 --> 01:53:02.116]  You're the best.
[01:53:02.176 --> 01:53:02.496]  Welcome.
[01:53:03.156 --> 01:53:03.916]  Hey, thank you, Alex.
[01:53:04.096 --> 01:53:07.337]  This is a long-time listener, first-time caller, okay?
[01:53:08.426 --> 01:53:12.670]  Uh, I was wondering if you guys have heard of aerogel or solid smoke.
[01:53:13.751 --> 01:53:18.134]  Which will be a perfect solution for the oil spill over there in the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:53:19.215 --> 01:53:33.366]  If you go to YouTube and type, uh, aerogel solution to Gulf oil slick, I have a video there of a guy showing how, how aerogel sucks up all the oil, leaving the water intact.
[01:53:34.407 --> 01:53:36.429]  It's an expensive solution, but it's something.
[01:53:37.264 --> 01:53:45.891]  Well, the other big thing is if you have 50, 60 million gallons or more pouring in, what factory can make
[01:53:47.119 --> 01:53:50.861]  Or deliver 60 million gallons of the Aerogel.
[01:53:51.622 --> 01:53:53.703]  I am familiar with a lot of the different solutions they have.
[01:53:53.743 --> 01:53:57.485]  I'm glad Kevin Costner Systems, the centrifuges, just got bought.
[01:53:58.005 --> 01:54:02.608]  The bigger issue is, within a year, almost all of that oil is going to biodegrade.
[01:54:03.108 --> 01:54:09.932]  I mean, I can't tell you how many tar balls I've seen in the Texas coast with just all sorts of life living on it.
[01:54:10.713 --> 01:54:11.973]  The bacteria eat it.
[01:54:12.434 --> 01:54:15.716]  Now, it's terrible when it comes into your estuaries and kills your fisheries.
[01:54:16.596 --> 01:54:19.939]  They should have blocked those up day one, but the feds wouldn't let the states do it.
[01:54:20.479 --> 01:54:21.960]  Why were the feds doing that?
[01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:27.124]  Why do the feds want to exacerbate the crisis?
[01:54:27.204 --> 01:54:28.285]  Ribbon, what do you think is going on?
[01:54:29.286 --> 01:54:36.631]  Well, I think like you mentioned before, they're going to take advantage of any crisis that happens, any catastrophe.
[01:54:36.651 --> 01:54:38.612]  They're going to take advantage of it.
[01:54:39.933 --> 01:54:40.954]  And it's a sad thing.
[01:54:41.395 --> 01:54:42.896]  It's a sad thing, Alex.
[01:54:43.945 --> 01:54:44.905]  I'm just hoping for the best.
[01:54:44.945 --> 01:54:46.886]  You know, I just threw out my two cents there.
[01:54:46.906 --> 01:54:49.727]  You know, people can check it out.
[01:54:49.747 --> 01:54:54.028]  You know, it's a guy on YouTube that, you know, they manufacture all the aerogel.
[01:54:55.389 --> 01:54:56.629]  And it shows a good video.
[01:54:56.709 --> 01:55:01.711]  And I think, you know, if people get the word out, maybe... I hear you.
[01:55:01.911 --> 01:55:02.531]  I hear you, Reuben.
[01:55:02.551 --> 01:55:03.691]  And I appreciate your call.
[01:55:04.012 --> 01:55:05.612]  And I think the oil spill's serious.
[01:55:06.232 --> 01:55:07.973]  But overall, it's a distraction.
[01:55:10.171 --> 01:55:10.992]  It's a distraction.
[01:55:11.012 --> 01:55:12.272]  It's something that happens every day.
[01:55:12.312 --> 01:55:13.393]  It's a soap opera.
[01:55:14.094 --> 01:55:15.654]  Oh, why won't Obama fix it?
[01:55:15.695 --> 01:55:18.216]  Don't worry, he's got a tax on you that'll fix it.
[01:55:18.937 --> 01:55:24.540]  But Lieberman says it's only a dollar a day per family.
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:25.541]  Just a dollar more.
[01:55:25.581 --> 01:55:26.862]  And of course, it's a lot more than that.
[01:55:27.202 --> 01:55:29.003]  The power to tax is the power to destroy.
[01:55:29.023 --> 01:55:31.064]  Let's talk to Mike in Ohio.
[01:55:31.124 --> 01:55:31.885]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:55:31.905 --> 01:55:33.926]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[01:55:33.946 --> 01:55:36.988]  The reason for my call today is I heard on YouTube before
[01:55:37.355 --> 01:55:45.977]  The interview before Lindsey Williams did with George Norrie last week, he did an interview, and he about gave some key information.
[01:55:46.177 --> 01:55:49.798]  I've got high-level sources that told me the same thing as what he was about to give up.
[01:55:50.438 --> 01:55:54.839]  He said, George, your listeners would be amazed on who controls the military.
[01:55:54.859 --> 01:55:55.639]  He about gave it up.
[01:55:55.859 --> 01:56:03.361]  I want to tell out to everybody in the listening audience that the Federal Reserve has taken full control of our military.
[01:56:03.797 --> 01:56:04.939]  And our foreign policy.
[01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:06.041]  It's already done.
[01:56:06.121 --> 01:56:07.664]  Obama has no say in it.
[01:56:08.085 --> 01:56:09.467]  Lindsey, if you get Lindsey on again...
[01:56:11.211 --> 01:56:13.051]  Please get him to answer that question.
[01:56:13.091 --> 01:56:15.012]  He will verify what I say.
[01:56:15.032 --> 01:56:16.112]  You know, that's a good idea.
[01:56:16.152 --> 01:56:19.073]  Let's get an update from Lindsey tomorrow or Friday.
[01:56:19.793 --> 01:56:26.314]  Let's set him up in the third or fourth hour again so people can call in and ask him questions.
[01:56:26.334 --> 01:56:27.014]  We'll get him on.
[01:56:27.354 --> 01:56:28.634]  We'll ask him that question.
[01:56:29.635 --> 01:56:36.636]  But I've seen the head of the War College, the Naval War College, admit the Pentagon works for offshore banks.
[01:56:38.175 --> 01:56:39.897]  And they teach the brass that.
[01:56:39.937 --> 01:56:41.479]  They teach them it's a corporate government.
[01:56:41.859 --> 01:56:43.000]  They're corporate officers.
[01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:44.001]  America's bad.
[01:56:44.422 --> 01:56:45.603]  America doesn't exist.
[01:56:45.923 --> 01:56:49.527]  But we've got to tell the general troops that it's still for America.
[01:56:50.048 --> 01:56:51.850]  We've got to still wrap that in the flag.
[01:56:51.870 --> 01:56:55.113]  But once the troops have served us, they're the number one enemy.
[01:56:55.233 --> 01:56:56.054]  They're the trash.
[01:56:56.375 --> 01:56:58.457]  The trash has got to be taken out and thrown in the dump.
[01:56:58.717 --> 01:57:00.338]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:57:00.378 --> 01:57:03.179]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.
[01:57:03.739 --> 01:57:08.662]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.
[01:57:08.962 --> 01:57:12.123]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.
[01:57:12.404 --> 01:57:14.745]  Check them out on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[01:57:15.385 --> 01:57:16.246]  Or call 800-340-7091.
[01:57:18.909 --> 01:57:19.849]  Take my word for it.
[01:57:20.050 --> 01:57:22.372]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[01:57:22.692 --> 01:57:28.918]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[01:57:29.219 --> 01:57:32.041]  Buy American and stay clean, as well as support InfoWars.
[01:57:32.161 --> 01:57:34.404]  Visit 5StarsSoap.com today, or call 1-800-340-7091.
[01:57:34.424 --> 01:57:35.685]  Well, Marty, what do you have to say?
[01:57:39.031 --> 01:57:46.280]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, satisfaction is guaranteed on W Dirtback.
[01:57:46.940 --> 01:57:51.065]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 for a free catalog or visit our website 5starsoap.com.
[01:57:51.085 --> 01:57:51.886]  Thank you!
[01:57:58.362 --> 01:58:00.684]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:58:00.764 --> 01:58:02.986]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:58:03.086 --> 01:58:05.868]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:58:06.288 --> 01:58:11.052]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:58:11.392 --> 01:58:15.596]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:58:15.896 --> 01:58:18.238]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:58:18.258 --> 01:58:20.779]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:58:21.139 --> 01:58:23.701]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:58:24.041 --> 01:58:31.646]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:58:31.983 --> 01:58:37.267]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:58:37.367 --> 01:58:40.169]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:58:40.229 --> 01:58:43.652]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:58:43.912 --> 01:58:44.812]  And I got news for you.
[01:58:44.993 --> 01:58:46.293]  You're everyone else.
[01:58:46.333 --> 01:58:47.434]  Invisible Empire.

[01:58:58.834 --> 01:59:01.435]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:59:01.855 --> 01:59:06.816]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:59:07.176 --> 01:59:08.916]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:59:09.216 --> 01:59:14.038]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:59:14.218 --> 01:59:15.178]  How much do you want?
[01:59:15.398 --> 01:59:16.158]  When do you want it?
[01:59:16.538 --> 01:59:18.139]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:59:18.419 --> 01:59:19.239]  When will you need it?
[01:59:19.499 --> 01:59:21.539]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:59:21.699 --> 01:59:22.800]  Will there be any food?
[01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:24.340]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:59:24.560 --> 01:59:29.623]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:59:29.823 --> 01:59:33.004]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:59:33.404 --> 01:59:36.906]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:59:37.226 --> 01:59:38.207]  How much will you need?
[01:59:38.447 --> 01:59:39.047]  We don't know.
[01:59:39.347 --> 01:59:40.268]  How much do you want?
[01:59:40.448 --> 01:59:41.168]  All you can get.
[01:59:41.188 --> 01:59:42.149]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:59:42.469 --> 01:59:45.232]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:59:45.532 --> 01:59:48.636]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:59:48.656 --> 01:59:49.417]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:00:00.149 --> 02:00:02.370]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:00:02.930 --> 02:00:05.732]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:20.942 --> 02:00:24.305]  Alright, we are now into our number four.
[02:00:24.365 --> 02:00:25.165]  Eight minutes in.
[02:00:25.926 --> 02:00:28.348]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:00:28.428 --> 02:00:35.073]  I'm gonna finish up with Steve, David, and Kevin.
[02:00:35.093 --> 02:00:37.275]  In fact, I see you just gave me a fresh list here.
[02:00:37.915 --> 02:00:39.537]  Who's first in this list, John?
[02:00:41.252 --> 02:00:53.635]  Okay, well then I may not be able to take all those calls because I am really behind schedule here and need to finish up with the most important news of the day.
[02:00:53.655 --> 02:00:57.215]  But I'm going to give each caller one minute.
[02:00:57.295 --> 02:00:59.696]  Mark in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:01:01.076 --> 02:01:03.077]  Great day to you all.
[02:01:03.117 --> 02:01:08.958]  Boy, this is something I'm hearing you say something each time that I think is very important.
[02:01:09.713 --> 02:01:17.715]  And I've really been trying to do it myself and that is not get distracted from all the craziness that these people do.
[02:01:17.755 --> 02:01:33.698]  I'm starting to just learn as I read the Bible through that Hebrews 9 and other things that these people are just crazy and I'm learning what can I do and just stay focused on that and I'm wondering what other people may be getting out of, you know, getting response out of, you know, just staying focused on like that fellow there, he was great.
[02:01:33.738 --> 02:01:35.218]  Boy, that guy Alex, man, he really,
[02:01:35.868 --> 02:01:36.328]  Just like you.
[02:01:36.348 --> 02:01:36.908]  You know what I mean?
[02:01:36.928 --> 02:01:38.149]  That was amazing stuff.
[02:01:38.189 --> 02:01:39.149]  I'm kind of stuttering a little bit.
[02:01:39.169 --> 02:01:39.730]  Well, no, Mark.
[02:01:39.770 --> 02:01:40.310]  God bless you.
[02:01:40.350 --> 02:01:41.330]  It's good to hear from you.
[02:01:41.690 --> 02:01:45.572]  We've got to stay focused, but we've got to decide what are the most important issues then.
[02:01:46.072 --> 02:01:47.873]  And I'm sorry it's not the oil spill.
[02:01:48.433 --> 02:01:50.574]  Yes, it's destroying some of the shrimpers' lives.
[02:01:50.974 --> 02:01:52.274]  Yes, it's hurting the Gulf Coast.
[02:01:52.634 --> 02:02:02.458]  But compared to trillions a month being stolen by offshore banks that are destroying our Bill of Rights and Constitution, liberty is the engine of our freedom.
[02:02:02.878 --> 02:02:04.619]  We'll bounce back from this oil spill.
[02:02:05.399 --> 02:02:07.201]  If the government lets us bounce back.
[02:02:07.682 --> 02:02:09.704]  If they hold BP accountable.
[02:02:10.024 --> 02:02:12.747]  But I'm here to tell you BP has bought and paid for Obama.
[02:02:13.327 --> 02:02:14.689]  It's one of his chief contributors.
[02:02:15.249 --> 02:02:18.032]  And when he says he's going to make them pay, you watch.
[02:02:18.072 --> 02:02:20.014]  They're going to end up paying a paltry sum.
[02:02:20.335 --> 02:02:24.999]  And they're going to make a lot more money on the carbon tax that they are progenitors of.
[02:02:25.300 --> 02:02:28.263]  They are the main kingpins along with
[02:02:30.633 --> 02:02:35.135]  Ken Lay's company, Enron, that cooked this up in the 80s and 90s.
[02:02:36.356 --> 02:02:46.021]  And their carbon tax situation that they've invested tens of billions of pushing in was in deep trouble and now this comes along and Obama's trying to ram it through using the crisis.
[02:02:46.441 --> 02:02:55.065]  And you've got BP and Goldman Sachs and the BP executive dumping their stock in the week before the spill and then Obama not letting people clean it up.
[02:02:55.125 --> 02:02:56.786]  It is very suspicious.
[02:02:57.247 --> 02:02:58.967]  Let's talk to George in Connecticut.
[02:02:58.987 --> 02:02:59.788]  George, you're on the air.
[02:03:00.822 --> 02:03:05.145]  Hi Alex, I'm glad to talk to the Truth Network instead of the liars of this world.
[02:03:05.966 --> 02:03:08.928]  I wanted to make a quick suggestion since we're in another shock doctor.
[02:03:08.948 --> 02:03:15.753]  Why don't we get Naomi Klein on so she can reevaluate how this might fit into the categories.
[02:03:15.833 --> 02:03:18.495]  Plus all the liberals out there don't want to believe this stuff.
[02:03:18.915 --> 02:03:21.277]  They can basically hear it from the horse's mouth.
[02:03:21.997 --> 02:03:29.983]  And also Gourvet Dahl because he gets on this stuff a lot so that the liberals can no longer say, oh well this is right wing conspiracy nonsense.
[02:03:30.612 --> 02:03:57.559]  And one last thing I wanted to say is John Lear, I came across an online thing that was under John Lear, tells all about Part 12, which he explains who exactly created the AIDS virus, which is a Dr. Donner for a, I guess a division of the Navy, S-4, and he explains how it can be cured through some sort of Chinese
[02:03:59.366 --> 02:04:00.387]  I appreciate the call.
[02:04:00.407 --> 02:04:01.848]  Let's talk to Stephen in Florida.
[02:04:01.868 --> 02:04:02.588]  You're on the air.
[02:04:02.608 --> 02:04:03.188]  Yeah, hey Alex.
[02:04:03.228 --> 02:04:05.209]  Two quick things on the Gulf and Chris Matthews.
[02:04:05.229 --> 02:04:05.650]  First of all,
[02:04:24.158 --> 02:04:41.744]  As far as I'm concerned, the Gulf situation, and you've pointed this out, it's got Inside Job written all over it, the fact that the feds won't allow the states to do what they want to do, these companies that have the microbes to eat the oil and the others with the skimming technology, now they have troops working with BP.
[02:04:42.344 --> 02:04:45.705]  The whole thing is about the carbon tax, that's absolutely certain.
[02:04:46.644 --> 02:04:47.845]  That's my take on that.
[02:04:47.905 --> 02:04:49.066]  Well, we knew it was coming.
[02:04:49.146 --> 02:04:59.073]  I mean, what does a carbon tax and taxes on oil and gasoline, how does taxing something get us off our dependents or not letting us drill in the U.S.
[02:04:59.093 --> 02:05:07.920]  get us off our dependents or not letting us have the safe overland pipelines from Alaska, which has more oil than Saudi Arabia?
[02:05:08.560 --> 02:05:09.681]  This is a monopoly.
[02:05:09.801 --> 02:05:12.163]  They won't let us have our oil.
[02:05:12.663 --> 02:05:14.945]  And so they're saying, you want something to be done about the oil spill?
[02:05:15.405 --> 02:05:18.047]  We'll just give you a carbon tax paid to BP.
[02:05:18.968 --> 02:05:20.049]  How's that sound to you?
[02:05:20.069 --> 02:05:30.156]  I mean, BP owns large portions of the Chicago Carbon Exchange, the Gore and Blood Carbon Exchange with Al Gore.
[02:05:31.977 --> 02:05:33.398]  Blood and Gore, no pun intended.
[02:05:34.299 --> 02:05:35.440]  Mr. Blood is the partner.
[02:05:35.860 --> 02:05:37.942]  I mean, they stand to gain from this.
[02:05:38.002 --> 02:05:40.684]  We've got to kill this carbon tax.
[02:05:42.145 --> 02:05:46.388]  And so it's about rewarding the criminal cartel that Alex was just talking about.
[02:05:46.408 --> 02:05:48.410]  That's what the whole thing, making us their slaves.
[02:05:48.870 --> 02:06:01.981]  The other thing is, you mentioned earlier with this hit piece by Matthews that's airing tonight, and then he says, Alex Jones thinks that, and of course his implication is you don't know what you're talking about, but if you think about it Alex, that's double speak, because actually that's what it is.
[02:06:02.581 --> 02:06:03.822]  Alex Jones thinks.
[02:06:04.372 --> 02:06:11.695]  He thinks critically based on the factual information and makes his conclusions based on... And they don't want you and the rest of us to think.
[02:06:11.735 --> 02:06:16.597]  They want us to all be the dumbed-down sheeple and just go blindly along and not think.
[02:06:16.637 --> 02:06:19.278]  So yes, you do think he's right about that.
[02:06:20.139 --> 02:06:20.939]  God bless you, Steve.
[02:06:20.979 --> 02:06:21.900]  I appreciate your call.
[02:06:21.980 --> 02:06:27.742]  I'll get to David, Kevin, Kirk, and others towards the end of the hour if we have time.
[02:06:28.142 --> 02:06:29.703]  But I've got to get to this news now.
[02:06:32.614 --> 02:06:34.275]  It's coming to a crescendo.
[02:06:35.096 --> 02:06:46.984]  We've had the Southern Poverty Law Center, within hours of Richard Plosky in Pennsylvania, killing three cops, saying that basically I told him to do it, and that he was my fan.
[02:06:47.604 --> 02:06:58.212]  We went and searched his name and found out he was attacking me, he hated me because I don't get into racial issues, and because I didn't hate Jews, on major Nazi websites.
[02:07:00.464 --> 02:07:02.766]  And then other newspapers picked it up.
[02:07:02.966 --> 02:07:06.850]  And I did force a retraction with threats of lawsuits in five newspapers.
[02:07:08.892 --> 02:07:17.100]  But since then, a year and a half ago, hundreds of news articles, there were three or four today I saw, say that I'm calling for violence.
[02:07:19.333 --> 02:07:23.817]  And that I'm going to cause people to kill cops.
[02:07:24.257 --> 02:07:26.399]  And that what I'm saying is going to cause violence.
[02:07:26.719 --> 02:07:45.275]  When I speak out against violence and say that we're winning peacefully, hearts and minds, and that the establishment is going to stage terror attacks to be blamed on libertarians, conservatives, patriots, people that are anti-New World Order, anti-war activists on the left, in that control paradigm.
[02:07:46.493 --> 02:07:48.715]  And we have the internal government documents that show this.
[02:07:49.095 --> 02:07:55.379]  We have the internal government documents that show that they are scared of what we the people are doing.
[02:07:56.920 --> 02:08:04.626]  And so, a week or so ago, I got the transcript of the television program that's going to air three times tonight.
[02:08:05.919 --> 02:08:07.460]  And remember, Chris Matthews is a joke.
[02:08:07.500 --> 02:08:08.861]  He has about a half a million viewers.
[02:08:09.361 --> 02:08:11.502]  That's the little leagues of cable TV.
[02:08:11.742 --> 02:08:14.484]  Glenn Beck's the big leagues, 3 million to 4 million.
[02:08:15.485 --> 02:08:16.945]  And that's still not that big of an audience.
[02:08:16.985 --> 02:08:18.546]  Rush Limbaugh's got 10 million a day.
[02:08:18.686 --> 02:08:20.468]  Coast to Coast AM, about 8 million a day.
[02:08:21.579 --> 02:08:23.642]  Over 30 million to 35 million plus.
[02:08:37.501 --> 02:08:38.402]  That gives you an idea.
[02:08:38.442 --> 02:08:41.544]  Talk radio is much bigger than cable TV.
[02:08:41.624 --> 02:08:44.806]  It's just cable TV has got 400, 500 channels.
[02:08:45.146 --> 02:08:46.207]  Talk radio doesn't.
[02:08:46.627 --> 02:08:48.909]  What, do you have two, three choices in your town of talk radio?
[02:08:49.269 --> 02:08:51.450]  If it's a big, big city, maybe five, six choices?
[02:08:51.811 --> 02:08:52.691]  Most of that's sports.
[02:08:53.572 --> 02:08:56.574]  My point is, is that Chris Matthews is a legend in his own mind.
[02:08:57.875 --> 02:09:03.198]  This is really an exercise in being even noticed.
[02:09:03.458 --> 02:09:06.020]  Even being in the game at any level.
[02:09:09.690 --> 02:09:16.854]  That's why Chris Matthews and MSNBC are constantly demonizing anybody who's against government corruption.
[02:09:17.255 --> 02:09:24.119]  That's why if you don't want the government running your health care, and the insurance companies writing the legislation to rip you off, you are a racist!
[02:09:24.979 --> 02:09:32.844]  Now, to even a five-year-old, you say, I don't want government running my health care, and they say you're a racist, that's code word for the n-word.
[02:09:33.044 --> 02:09:33.645]  That's a quote.
[02:09:35.026 --> 02:09:37.027]  Anyone with common sense says that's ridiculous.
[02:09:37.467 --> 02:09:48.892]  The only way that Chris Matthews can be relevant in any way is to make outrageous statements.
[02:09:50.180 --> 02:09:53.642]  Is to say, if you don't like big government, you're a racist.
[02:09:54.523 --> 02:10:02.768]  If you believe there's a population control agenda, which is admitted by the way, we have a big article today detailing it, you want to kill cops.
[02:10:03.489 --> 02:10:13.235]  And the piece coming up tonight, according to the script, says, you know, Jones isn't probably going to be out pulling triggers on cops, but his followers certainly are.
[02:10:14.853 --> 02:10:29.265]  So, a half million people, probably more because they've been hyping this for a few weeks, are going to watch this and it still has that authority though of a guy in a suit with fancy teleprompters and a fancy set saying Alex Jones wants to kill cops.
[02:10:31.369 --> 02:10:39.771]  And last night, the night before, he said similar things about how we're going to cause violence on his hardball show.
[02:10:40.631 --> 02:10:52.854]  And so when we come back from break, I'm going to play part of this exchange, and then I'm going to come back and play a clip of one of their other talk show hosts calling for basically Obama to be a dictator.
[02:10:53.295 --> 02:10:58.756]  And I saw the comments on the YouTube saying, yeah, we need a dictator to clean this up.
[02:11:00.077 --> 02:11:03.038]  A dictatorship is going to give us freedom.
[02:11:03.599 --> 02:11:07.761]  A dictatorship is what it takes to fix America.
[02:11:09.722 --> 02:11:15.905]  And in that human trait, that mob psychology trait, you see the real danger.
[02:11:16.445 --> 02:11:23.348]  Obama is dangerous, and they test-ballooned him as a messiah, as a savior, to bring in tyranny.
[02:11:23.768 --> 02:11:29.231]  But that cult of personality got shot down very quickly because people wanted instant gratification.
[02:11:30.595 --> 02:11:37.558]  The real danger is the next savior they're going to bring into office after Mr. Obama leaves in the next two and a half years, I predict.
[02:11:38.238 --> 02:11:40.159]  He may still stage a terror attack and try to stay in.
[02:11:40.519 --> 02:11:42.480]  Anything's possible in World War III with Iran.
[02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:44.861]  He may end up being like Roosevelt, four or five terrorists.
[02:11:45.401 --> 02:11:45.901]  Who knows?
[02:11:48.202 --> 02:11:53.164]  The point is, the danger here is, they're going to really start promoting dictatorship.
[02:11:53.604 --> 02:11:54.945]  And I'm seeing this more and more.
[02:11:55.265 --> 02:11:57.826]  If we just had a dictator, they could fix it all.
[02:12:00.003 --> 02:12:02.586]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:12:03.007 --> 02:12:07.973]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:12:08.334 --> 02:12:10.076]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:12:10.396 --> 02:12:15.163]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:12:15.523 --> 02:12:15.663]  Yeah.
[02:12:35.256 --> 02:12:35.576]  I think?
[02:12:59.236 --> 02:13:01.539]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:13:01.619 --> 02:13:03.822]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:13:03.942 --> 02:13:06.746]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:13:07.146 --> 02:13:11.892]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:13:12.253 --> 02:13:16.458]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:13:16.758 --> 02:13:19.119]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:13:19.219 --> 02:13:21.620]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:13:21.980 --> 02:13:24.561]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:13:24.902 --> 02:13:32.505]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:13:32.845 --> 02:13:38.110]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:13:38.230 --> 02:13:41.032]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:13:41.092 --> 02:13:44.515]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:13:44.775 --> 02:13:45.676]  And I got news for you.
[02:13:45.836 --> 02:13:47.157]  You're everyone else.
[02:13:47.197 --> 02:13:48.198]  Invisible Empire.

[02:14:00.328 --> 02:14:01.390]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:14:01.790 --> 02:14:07.257]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:14:07.838 --> 02:14:08.339]  That's right.
[02:14:08.659 --> 02:14:10.942]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:14:11.503 --> 02:14:18.432]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:14:18.972 --> 02:14:26.657]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:14:27.118 --> 02:14:31.961]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:14:32.601 --> 02:14:35.623]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:14:38.385 --> 02:14:42.510]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.

[02:14:45.773 --> 02:14:46.053]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:14:59.099 --> 02:15:00.440]  Don't answer it!

[02:15:16.892 --> 02:15:20.955]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?

[02:15:51.676 --> 02:15:51.997]  That's 800-477-9256.
[02:15:52.097 --> 02:15:54.278]  Okay, let's get into this Matthews hit piece first.
[02:16:08.612 --> 02:16:12.913]  And then I'm going to get into other MSNBC hosts calling for dictatorship.
[02:16:13.433 --> 02:16:14.633]  I'm not going to play the whole video.
[02:16:14.693 --> 02:16:15.594]  It's eight minutes long.
[02:16:17.354 --> 02:16:19.274]  It's up on prisonplanet.com.
[02:16:20.034 --> 02:16:22.335]  But here is the first part of it.
[02:16:23.675 --> 02:16:27.676]  The new right, an emerging factor of life in 21st century America.
[02:16:29.617 --> 02:16:31.457]  Tea parties, birthers.
[02:16:32.628 --> 02:16:33.408]  Patriot groups.
[02:16:33.728 --> 02:16:34.348]  Militias.
[02:16:35.709 --> 02:16:36.769]  Their common cause?
[02:16:37.129 --> 02:16:41.070]  A raging hostility toward the elected government of the United States.
[02:16:41.510 --> 02:16:42.991]  We are in deep tyranny.
[02:16:43.511 --> 02:16:44.851]  Deep, deep, deep.
[02:16:46.112 --> 02:16:47.132]  Their common fear?
[02:16:47.552 --> 02:16:51.073]  That their personal rights and freedoms stand in imminent jeopardy.
[02:16:53.453 --> 02:16:58.981]  Tyranny is something that we've been warned from the very beginning by the founding fathers that we have to be on guard against.
[02:16:59.382 --> 02:17:00.323]  Their common enemy?
[02:17:00.663 --> 02:17:04.749]  The President of the United States, Barack Obama.
[02:17:04.769 --> 02:17:09.175]  We're either going to stop him, or the United States of America is going to cease to exist.
[02:17:10.196 --> 02:17:14.299]  From right of center to the farthest fringe, they resent what they see America becoming.
[02:17:14.819 --> 02:17:19.502]  Tens of millions are ready to vote no to everything the new president proposes.
[02:17:19.562 --> 02:17:24.104]  But for others, the fight is bigger than bills in Congress or election candidates.
[02:17:24.565 --> 02:17:27.366]  In their own words, they want to take their country back.
[02:17:28.827 --> 02:17:33.270]  David Corn is Washington Bureau Chief for Mother Jones Magazine and writes for politicscom.com.
[02:17:33.770 --> 02:17:35.471]  He writes for politicsdaily.com.
[02:17:35.491 --> 02:17:36.992]  Pat Buchanan is of course Pat Buchanan.
[02:17:38.593 --> 02:17:42.735]  Pat, you're one of the stars of this, not because you're a current hero, but because you were a pathfinder.
[02:17:43.195 --> 02:17:57.660]  What I find stunning about this, and I think liberals, progressives, people from the center-left will be stunned and scared by what they see tomorrow night, people on the right may find themselves yelling, right on, right on, because a lot of this documentary is simply people on the right saying their thing.
[02:17:57.700 --> 02:18:03.762]  From Glenn Beck, to Rush Limbaugh, to Orly Tates, to all these people out there, Alex Jones, saying their thing.
[02:18:03.822 --> 02:18:05.303]  It's a true documentary, as you know.
[02:18:05.803 --> 02:18:11.969]  What is it today that scares people about Washington government to the point where some are arming themselves?
[02:18:11.989 --> 02:18:13.290]  They're calling it illegitimate.
[02:18:13.310 --> 02:18:14.831]  This government was elected legitimately.
[02:18:15.532 --> 02:18:16.653]  They're calling it a tyranny.
[02:18:16.893 --> 02:18:18.174]  It's not right-left anymore.
[02:18:18.315 --> 02:18:19.916]  It sounds revolutionary, these people.
[02:18:20.156 --> 02:18:20.496]  All of them.
[02:18:20.697 --> 02:18:23.259]  Tea Party, militia, patriot groups.
[02:18:25.425 --> 02:18:26.425]  Back it up a few seconds.
[02:18:27.466 --> 02:18:31.227]  We're not saying that it's illegitimate because it wasn't elected.
[02:18:31.807 --> 02:18:43.271]  We're saying it's illegitimate for the government to take over one-seventh of the economy and for it to be written by the insurance companies to cut benefits and raise taxes.
[02:18:44.092 --> 02:18:52.575]  We're saying it's illegitimate that Obama's real name is Barry Sitaro and he is an Indonesian citizen and an ineligible
[02:18:53.919 --> 02:18:56.342]  to be president, not just being born in Kenya.
[02:18:56.922 --> 02:19:16.563]  The evidence all points towards that, but it's 100% he's a Kenyan communist supporter, and he supported Odinga, his cousin, the Muslim extremist who murdered a bunch of Christians, and that Obama was involved supporting that and advising him how to do it, and that he is a Indonesian citizen.
[02:19:18.527 --> 02:19:20.008]  But it's not just about Obama.
[02:19:20.649 --> 02:19:25.593]  The original Tea Parties were Ron Paul supporters, sick of the wars, sick of Bush crippling government.
[02:19:28.055 --> 02:19:32.619]  All these idiot Obama supporters thought they were going to get free cars, free houses, free everything.
[02:19:32.639 --> 02:19:33.319]  Remember all that?
[02:19:33.339 --> 02:19:35.541]  A year and a half later, they don't think that anymore.
[02:19:35.861 --> 02:19:37.783]  Obama's got a very low approval rating.
[02:19:39.775 --> 02:19:42.960]  What, are 60% of the American people that hate his guts, are they terrorists?
[02:19:43.882 --> 02:19:45.124]  Obama is a puppet.
[02:19:45.405 --> 02:19:46.787]  Obama is a front man.
[02:19:47.087 --> 02:19:49.171]  Obama doesn't matter at the end of the day.
[02:19:50.089 --> 02:19:52.570]  See, they want to make this about left-right.
[02:19:52.590 --> 02:19:54.350]  They want to make this about Obama.
[02:19:54.790 --> 02:19:58.731]  None of what I told Matthew's people about serious issues is in the film.
[02:19:59.232 --> 02:20:00.732]  Everything's taken out of context.
[02:20:01.272 --> 02:20:13.576]  Like my quote, and I gave their interviewee the documents, the quotes, about reducing our population between 80 and 90 percent, and I went on to say some of their people say get rid of all humans.
[02:20:14.036 --> 02:20:15.676]  Some say get rid of 99 percent.
[02:20:15.876 --> 02:20:16.916]  This is all on record.
[02:20:17.117 --> 02:20:18.477]  This is in the news every day.
[02:20:18.897 --> 02:20:19.979]  People calling for this.
[02:20:20.781 --> 02:20:22.323]  This is what the globalists want!
[02:20:23.005 --> 02:20:25.088]  This is what their New World Order's endgame is!
[02:20:26.616 --> 02:20:28.196]  But let's finish up, continue.
[02:20:52.703 --> 02:20:53.904]  Truth birthers.
[02:20:53.924 --> 02:20:56.945]  What is it you don't get, bankers?
[02:20:57.165 --> 02:20:58.505]  Because they use the same language.
[02:20:58.745 --> 02:21:01.886]  Well, they do, but look, look, I don't know these Michigan militia guys.
[02:21:02.267 --> 02:21:05.128]  I don't go out with them into the woods and things like that.
[02:21:05.668 --> 02:21:08.869]  And I don't know if these guys with guns and things like that really represent a Tea Party.
[02:21:08.889 --> 02:21:16.912]  What you've got to ask, Chris, is how is it that a Tea Party that you describe in a one-hour documentary as very dangerous and in some ways threatening,
[02:21:17.592 --> 02:21:25.456]  Had a 2-1 approval record and the Tea Party was more admired and approving of than the Democratic Party and the Republican Party as of a couple of months ago.
[02:21:25.756 --> 02:21:28.698]  Where you've got it pretty close, I think, Chris, is the second part.
[02:21:29.038 --> 02:21:35.801]  I think the first part would be like me doing a documentary on the Civil Rights Movement and starting off with Stokely Carmichael and H. Rap around.
[02:21:35.821 --> 02:21:36.382]  Alright, stop there.
[02:21:36.702 --> 02:21:39.103]  We're going to come back from break and finish this up.
[02:21:40.524 --> 02:21:44.426]  But they know exactly what they're doing.
[02:21:45.738 --> 02:21:47.119]  Absolute brainwashing.
[02:21:47.139 --> 02:21:48.040]  We'll be right back.
[02:21:49.322 --> 02:21:50.222]  We're on the march.
[02:21:50.723 --> 02:21:52.304]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:21:53.245 --> 02:21:55.948]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:58.740 --> 02:22:03.583]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:22:03.703 --> 02:22:04.463]  What have we got?
[02:22:04.703 --> 02:22:06.824]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:22:07.145 --> 02:22:07.865]  A republic.
[02:22:08.145 --> 02:22:10.727]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:22:10.787 --> 02:22:12.708]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:22:13.068 --> 02:22:14.969]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:22:15.089 --> 02:22:16.350]  So they think they own our land?
[02:22:16.770 --> 02:22:17.890]  They think they own our water?
[02:22:18.091 --> 02:22:18.491]  Children?
[02:22:18.691 --> 02:22:19.471]  Our education?
[02:22:19.811 --> 02:22:20.432]  Our money?
[02:22:20.652 --> 02:22:24.294]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:22:24.654 --> 02:22:28.300]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:22:29.642 --> 02:22:30.463]  We have the facts.
[02:22:30.663 --> 02:22:31.765]  We have the Constitution.
[02:22:31.825 --> 02:22:32.706]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:22:32.726 --> 02:22:33.567]  We have common law.
[02:22:33.608 --> 02:22:35.871]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:36.131 --> 02:22:39.917]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:22:40.017 --> 02:22:44.800]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:22:44.961 --> 02:22:46.342]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:22:46.462 --> 02:22:47.302]  Don't tread on me.
[02:22:47.562 --> 02:22:54.427]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:22:59.810 --> 02:23:05.532]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.

[02:23:58.430 --> 02:24:02.371]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:24:02.611 --> 02:24:08.652]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:24:09.012 --> 02:24:16.114]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:24:16.394 --> 02:24:20.995]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:24:24.056 --> 02:24:26.517]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:24:26.577 --> 02:24:28.858]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:24:28.878 --> 02:24:29.298]  Call us!
[02:24:45.723 --> 02:24:46.283]  At 1-800-340-7091.
[02:24:46.423 --> 02:24:56.926]  Visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a 1-2 month soap sampler.
[02:24:57.166 --> 02:24:57.607]  Thank you.
[02:24:59.207 --> 02:25:00.047]  Federal agents!
[02:25:00.247 --> 02:25:03.888]  We are armed!
[02:25:03.908 --> 02:25:08.210]  Pat Buchanan made the central point that they've had polls where as high as 84%.
[02:25:11.601 --> 02:25:18.730]  Have more favorable comments about the Tea Party, when asked, versus 40% roughly supporting Obama.
[02:25:19.130 --> 02:25:19.951]  So, 2 to 1.
[02:25:21.253 --> 02:25:27.621]  You've got a network like MSNBC with its top shows with half a million viewers.
[02:25:29.156 --> 02:25:33.459]  CNN, just three years ago, had three million viewers for Larry King Live.
[02:25:33.499 --> 02:25:34.259]  Now it's got a million.
[02:25:34.900 --> 02:25:37.121]  Their number one show has a million viewers.
[02:25:38.022 --> 02:25:39.703]  No one is watching these people.
[02:25:40.243 --> 02:25:55.954]  Not only because they're tuning away from TV to the Internet, because they can get more depth and breadth of discussion and ideas, and get off the phony left-right paradigm plantation, but because they know these people have an agenda.
[02:25:57.235 --> 02:25:58.616]  Now, Paul Watson wrote an article
[02:26:00.157 --> 02:26:07.544]  And pointed out that Chris Matthews has defended domestic terrorists while smearing Americans as dangerous radicals.
[02:26:09.085 --> 02:26:12.268]  Matthews, on video, has said that he likes Lenin.
[02:26:12.829 --> 02:26:15.031]  He likes Saul Alinsky.
[02:26:15.111 --> 02:26:16.452]  He likes communism.
[02:26:17.216 --> 02:26:22.540]  But then, the Tea Parties hold up signs saying, we don't want communism, and he calls them nuts!
[02:26:22.980 --> 02:26:26.403]  See, that's how arrogant somebody like Chris Matthews is.
[02:26:26.423 --> 02:26:29.105]  He makes millions of dollars a year, what is it, three or four million a year.
[02:26:30.086 --> 02:26:35.550]  He sits up there, he works for the big banks, he wants to communalize your wealth so he can control it.
[02:26:36.710 --> 02:26:39.053]  And then he tells you it doesn't exist and you're crazy.
[02:26:39.393 --> 02:26:40.935]  That's why he has a half million viewers.
[02:26:41.436 --> 02:26:48.223]  And so that's why he's got to air this three times a day, twice tomorrow, and one time again every day for the next two weeks.
[02:26:48.984 --> 02:26:49.865]  Is what they're scheduling.
[02:26:49.885 --> 02:26:55.011]  Just, just, just, just airing it constantly, over and over again, hoping they have an effect.
[02:26:55.672 --> 02:27:02.675]  Hoping if they sling enough mud up against the wall that it has some type of effect while Chris Matthews sits up there and says, I control reality.
[02:27:03.035 --> 02:27:04.456]  I tell you what's safe to watch.
[02:27:04.616 --> 02:27:05.937]  I tell you what's safe to see.
[02:27:06.517 --> 02:27:10.499]  And in that video clip last night, he's like, this is going to scare a lot of progressives.
[02:27:10.999 --> 02:27:14.060]  This is going to scare a lot of mainline liberals.
[02:27:14.901 --> 02:27:16.121]  Oh, it's so scary.
[02:27:16.422 --> 02:27:18.382]  These people want to overthrow the government.
[02:27:18.803 --> 02:27:21.904]  Chris Matthews knows it's a foreign corporate takeover of the US.
[02:27:22.144 --> 02:27:23.645]  He worked for a US president.
[02:27:24.707 --> 02:27:27.549]  He knows there's eugenics going on, so does Pat Buchanan.
[02:27:28.009 --> 02:27:29.370]  He knows all of this is real.
[02:27:29.911 --> 02:27:31.372]  Now, here's the key clip.
[02:27:31.392 --> 02:27:36.255]  They say, this Alex Jones is being legitimized by Rand Paul.
[02:27:36.956 --> 02:27:38.337]  That's not really what they're worried about.
[02:27:39.721 --> 02:28:00.035]  They're worried about my message becoming mainstream, and they know that if people start talking about poison in the water, and if people start talking about brainwashing on television, and if people start talking about GMO foods sterilizing them, and if people start talking about world government, and real issues that are there, it's game over.
[02:28:00.335 --> 02:28:05.879]  No one's going to care anymore hearing how scary the militia is, and the federal judges order their release.
[02:28:06.599 --> 02:28:07.280]  It was all fake.
[02:28:08.843 --> 02:28:15.466]  No one is going to, because they're going to know the real killers, the real control freaks, are the people running our government.
[02:28:16.087 --> 02:28:18.728]  This is a group of criminals to the max.
[02:28:19.068 --> 02:28:20.209]  Let's finish up with this clip.
[02:28:21.710 --> 02:28:23.590]  I think you're mixing an awful lot of things up.
[02:28:23.630 --> 02:28:25.171]  Well, because they use the same language.
[02:28:25.371 --> 02:28:25.772]  Well, they do.
[02:28:25.832 --> 02:28:28.533]  But look, look, I mean, I don't know these Michigan militia guys.
[02:28:28.913 --> 02:28:31.775]  I don't go out with them into the woods and things like that.
[02:28:32.315 --> 02:28:36.617]  And I don't know if these guys with guns and things like that really represent a Tea Party, which you've got to ask Chris.
[02:28:36.637 --> 02:28:37.157]  Pause again.
[02:28:37.257 --> 02:28:37.898]  How is it that a...
[02:28:38.777 --> 02:28:39.577]  See, they're scared.
[02:28:40.578 --> 02:28:42.159]  They want to be the government with the guns.
[02:28:42.259 --> 02:28:44.059]  They want to be the government with men in black ski masks.
[02:28:44.320 --> 02:28:48.501]  They want to be the government face scanning you and making you have an ID to have a job, but illegals are exempt.
[02:28:48.902 --> 02:28:51.583]  They want to be the ones with all the force, the monopoly of force.
[02:28:52.163 --> 02:28:56.305]  It scares them, the true Americana of Americans buying guns and training with it.
[02:28:57.125 --> 02:29:01.627]  It scares them that 20 plus million guns have been sold in the last year and a half, breaking all records.
[02:29:01.968 --> 02:29:04.929]  It scares them that people are getting real and are
[02:29:05.069 --> 02:29:11.933]  That's not caring about the political correctness of basically wetting themselves every time Chris Matthews shows them a gun.
[02:29:12.333 --> 02:29:17.776]  And I won't have time to play the whole piece, but at the end of the eight-minute piece, Chris Matthews says, they've got guns!
[02:29:18.196 --> 02:29:19.677]  They're wearing guns!
[02:29:20.257 --> 02:29:20.778]  Well, yeah.
[02:29:21.318 --> 02:29:24.660]  How can they ban all guns if people start wearing guns everywhere?
[02:29:24.840 --> 02:29:26.841]  Then all the sheep go, I thought guns were illegal.
[02:29:27.101 --> 02:29:31.664]  You know, the average sheep in Austin, Texas, I talked to, the middle of Texas, they believe guns are illegal.
[02:29:32.406 --> 02:29:42.131]  If they come to your house to clean your carpet or fix your toilet, and they're not from Texas, I mean, it's happened to me, and they see a gun case, they begin living in fear.
[02:29:42.371 --> 02:29:47.734]  Just like that Chris Matthews reporter, the producer of the show that came down here to interview me.
[02:29:48.914 --> 02:29:59.359]  She saw a gun on the shelf over here and literally couldn't breathe and was hyperventilating and sort of crying, and I thought something was wrong with her because she couldn't talk for about 60 seconds.
[02:29:59.399 --> 02:29:59.540]  It was...
[02:30:04.395 --> 02:30:06.437]  And literally was in such terror she couldn't breathe.
[02:30:06.457 --> 02:30:07.277]  I was like, what's wrong?
[02:30:07.297 --> 02:30:08.238]  I put my hands on her.
[02:30:08.278 --> 02:30:08.958]  What's wrong?
[02:30:08.978 --> 02:30:11.820]  I'm sorry.
[02:30:14.102 --> 02:30:15.923]  And again, she feels safe.
[02:30:21.109 --> 02:30:32.219]  When she sees a guy on a SWAT team with a gun or a FEMA camp or, you know, checkpoints or body scanners, she's like, oh, the government hurting us and lining us up and checking our papers.
[02:30:32.239 --> 02:30:32.899]  That's freedom.
[02:30:33.360 --> 02:30:36.403]  But she sees a slave with a gun
[02:30:37.853 --> 02:30:40.375]  And she goes into convulsions of fear.
[02:30:40.455 --> 02:30:42.937]  Her religion is being disarmed and weak.
[02:30:43.438 --> 02:31:05.656]  And so these cloistered little elitists, they have taught people to have a psychological revulsion of women that are women, cars that are cars, men that are men, just red-blooded Americana, everything that flag really symbolizes, private property, Constitution, real capitalism, not crony capitalism.
[02:31:05.916 --> 02:31:06.557]  They hate it!
[02:31:09.261 --> 02:31:09.861]  They hate it!
[02:31:10.502 --> 02:31:12.963]  They absolutely hate it!
[02:31:13.823 --> 02:31:16.685]  Because if they were real world people, they wouldn't be for tyranny.
[02:31:16.705 --> 02:31:19.086]  Go ahead and finish the clip.
[02:31:20.182 --> 02:31:34.270]  The Tea Party that you describe in a one-hour documentary as very dangerous and in some ways threatening had a two-to-one approval record and the Tea Party was more admired and approving of than the Democratic Party and the Republican Party as of a couple of months ago.
[02:31:34.570 --> 02:31:37.512]  Where you've got it pretty close, I think, Chris, is the second part.
[02:31:37.852 --> 02:31:40.434]  I think the first part would be like me doing a documentary
[02:31:40.854 --> 02:31:53.528]  On the civil rights movement, and starting off with Stokely Carmichael and H. Rap Brown, and you know, Malcolm X and Elijah Muhammad, and then you get around to Whitney Young and... Yeah, but Martin Luther King was never a black nationalist.
[02:31:53.549 --> 02:31:54.790]  He wasn't calling for separation.
[02:31:54.950 --> 02:31:55.631]  Let me go to you, David.
[02:31:55.911 --> 02:31:58.554]  It seems to me what strikes me in doing this... Hit pause again.
[02:32:00.643 --> 02:32:01.903]  Look at that sign right there.
[02:32:01.943 --> 02:32:03.104]  Back it up about a second, please.
[02:32:03.764 --> 02:32:09.106]  For people watching on PresidentPlanet.tv, it says, vote out all incumbents crooks.
[02:32:09.826 --> 02:32:20.629]  You've got every incumbent in every race, whether it's Florida, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Hawaii, Colorado, Republican and Democrat being voted out.
[02:32:20.869 --> 02:32:21.770]  That's never happened before.
[02:32:21.810 --> 02:32:24.490]  It's always one party's out of favor, one party's in favor.
[02:32:24.851 --> 02:32:25.911]  That's what they're panicked by.
[02:32:27.045 --> 02:32:32.967]  You go to a Tea Party, most of the signs are, both parties are bad, we're bankrupt, you know, cut the size of government.
[02:32:33.588 --> 02:32:38.349]  And that's why they hate the Tea Party so much, because at its roots, it's bipartisan.
[02:32:38.689 --> 02:32:40.530]  At its roots, it's trans-partisan.
[02:32:41.270 --> 02:32:52.075]  And so, first they want to make it a Republican issue so they can divide and conquer, then they want to radicalize it and demonize it, and they want to be gatekeepers and say, look, this Alex Jones is too popular.
[02:32:52.715 --> 02:32:53.395]  He's a kook.
[02:32:53.495 --> 02:32:55.416]  He says the government wants to reduce your numbers.
[02:32:56.650 --> 02:32:58.992]  When that is the stated State Department U.S.
[02:32:59.012 --> 02:33:00.774]  policy, stated U.N.
[02:33:00.834 --> 02:33:19.811]  policy, and the stated White House science czar, who has written more than ten books and booklets, we own them all, and here's the textbook he wrote, Ecoscience, where it calls for drugging the water to sterilize you, and calls for a planetary regime to do it, and calls for, you know, basically forced abortion.
[02:33:21.087 --> 02:33:22.949]  I mean, this is the White House science czar.
[02:33:23.570 --> 02:33:26.633]  They say we want a planetary government to then carry this out.
[02:33:27.714 --> 02:33:32.359]  I mean, look, Chris Matthews is a dead political duck.
[02:33:33.640 --> 02:33:36.784]  He wants to make this violent because he's losing the political fight.
[02:33:38.165 --> 02:33:43.451]  And just like they told you the vaccines wouldn't hurt you, and I said, folks, don't believe me, don't believe Matthews.
[02:33:45.131 --> 02:33:48.413]  Don't believe Fox News, they were up there lying too, and CNN.
[02:33:48.473 --> 02:34:01.060]  I said, go to the Walgreens, go to the CVS, go to the Savons or Vons or whatever it is, or the Eckerd, go to the pharmacy and say, I want the insert that came with the shot bottle.
[02:34:01.900 --> 02:34:12.646]  And you read it, and it says, causes Guillain-Barré, other neurological disorders, Lou Gehrig's disease, brain damage, sterilization, reduced fertility, and cancer.
[02:34:14.051 --> 02:34:15.972]  Read the stinking insert!
[02:34:16.213 --> 02:34:16.693]  And you know what?
[02:34:16.713 --> 02:34:18.954]  People just take the challenge and they read the stinking insert.
[02:34:19.595 --> 02:34:21.176]  And they find out who's telling the truth.
[02:34:21.396 --> 02:34:23.558]  And it ain't you, Chris Slimeball Matthews.
[02:34:23.738 --> 02:34:24.678]  Let's finish up with this clip.
[02:34:24.718 --> 02:34:25.019]  Here it is.
[02:34:41.670 --> 02:34:47.433]  Honestly elected with four times the Wall Street money, five times the Goldman Sachs money.
[02:34:47.853 --> 02:34:55.738]  Honestly elected, held up as a messianic leader by the media, knowing people were mad at their last puppet Bush, catapulting him in to break every promise.
[02:34:56.578 --> 02:34:58.099]  Look, please continue.
[02:34:59.738 --> 02:35:01.139]  They're saying he's not an American.
[02:35:01.319 --> 02:35:02.941]  They're saying he's illegitimate.
[02:35:02.961 --> 02:35:04.402]  This language, I've never heard before.
[02:35:04.762 --> 02:35:15.611]  What was interesting to me about the piece that you did was that you showed the continuum between people, big armies of the world who you interview, who was a member of Congress, you know, libertarian conservative,
[02:35:15.931 --> 02:35:18.533]  You know, helping to stir up the tea party.
[02:35:18.793 --> 02:35:21.295]  And then you have someone like Alex Jones, who we just saw on that clip.
[02:35:21.795 --> 02:35:24.697]  A radio talk show host who says he's not right, says he's not left.
[02:35:25.017 --> 02:35:31.762]  But he says that we are, that basically there is a planetary elite that literally has a secret plan
[02:35:32.122 --> 02:35:32.963]  That's enough.
[02:35:56.857 --> 02:35:59.558]  And then he will not disown the birthers, he goes on to say.
[02:36:00.218 --> 02:36:08.440]  Well, I mean, his cousin Odinga is a mass murderer on record with Obama directing him to riot to be made Prime Minister.
[02:36:08.940 --> 02:36:10.261]  They created that position for him.
[02:36:10.541 --> 02:36:11.621]  He's from Indonesia.
[02:36:11.681 --> 02:36:12.341]  I've already covered it.
[02:36:12.361 --> 02:36:14.162]  I mean, he is an Indonesian citizen.
[02:36:14.422 --> 02:36:15.442]  He is illegitimate.
[02:36:16.109 --> 02:36:17.430]  You can't give up your U.S.
[02:36:17.470 --> 02:36:20.952]  citizenship to be an Indonesian citizen and then retroactively get your U.S.
[02:36:20.972 --> 02:36:21.812]  citizenship back.
[02:36:22.032 --> 02:36:24.293]  He never gave up the Indonesian to begin with.
[02:36:24.854 --> 02:36:31.017]  What are we doing having a president who's got all these different names from Indonesia?
[02:36:33.695 --> 02:36:42.101]  But listen, everybody, MSNBC and cover-up of manifestly provable population control program, a very important article.
[02:36:42.602 --> 02:36:50.888]  And then we have another article, we're hitting them from all sides, MSNBC goons assault Tea Party activists while pointing fingers at others for violence.
[02:36:51.188 --> 02:36:56.573]  That video of MSNBC people attacking a reporter with a knife.
[02:36:57.213 --> 02:36:59.694]  is up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:36:59.835 --> 02:37:04.697]  MSNBC goons assault Tea Party activists while pointing fingers at others for violence.
[02:37:04.737 --> 02:37:09.060]  And we show other videos of Obama thugs beating people up and the media ignoring it.
[02:37:09.380 --> 02:37:15.984]  And then meanwhile you've got last week Chris Matthews supporting Bill Ayers who murdered people and bombed police.
[02:37:16.624 --> 02:37:19.846]  This little punk likes people that bomb police.
[02:37:20.326 --> 02:37:22.207]  I'm up here saying non-violence.
[02:37:22.428 --> 02:37:23.628]  Let's fix this peacefully.
[02:37:23.889 --> 02:37:31.873]  And this little punk is supporting the weathermen that bombed and killed and wounded and blinded more than 25 police.
[02:37:33.094 --> 02:37:35.015]  That's how sick these revolutionaries are.
[02:37:35.255 --> 02:37:37.157]  But now they're running the country.
[02:37:37.457 --> 02:37:39.238]  They're the scumbag revolutionaries.
[02:37:39.518 --> 02:37:40.779]  They know we're on to them.
[02:37:41.019 --> 02:37:43.821]  So they want a dictatorship of their corrupt government.
[02:37:44.505 --> 02:37:49.330]  And I've got all the mainstream news, new bill gives Obama kill switch to shut down the internet.
[02:37:49.791 --> 02:37:53.234]  Don't want to read it at PrisonPlanet.com, go read it at DrudgeReport.com.
[02:37:53.474 --> 02:38:00.281]  Now I'm going to Aaron Dykes in a moment on the eugenics front, but before we do that here, let's go to the next clip.
[02:38:01.141 --> 02:38:02.462]  By the way, that's a small sampling.
[02:38:02.982 --> 02:38:05.643]  They're attacking me on every major show on MSNBC.
[02:38:06.003 --> 02:38:06.363]  Why?
[02:38:06.683 --> 02:38:07.544]  We're affected.
[02:38:07.884 --> 02:38:18.148]  They know that if you go read the article, MSNBC, and cover up a manifestly provable population control plan, you're not going to be scared of their oil spill they staged, no doubt of it now.
[02:38:18.788 --> 02:38:22.370]  And you'll give up all your rights to them, and all this tax money.
[02:38:23.479 --> 02:38:29.821]  They know that if you realize just how evil these controllers are, you're not going to be scared of little men in caves anymore and give your liberties up.
[02:38:30.101 --> 02:38:35.343]  If you figure out who the real danger is, like Thomas Jefferson warned us, their party is over!
[02:38:37.924 --> 02:38:41.045]  And as Newsweek said, I am the prophet of the tea parties.
[02:38:41.445 --> 02:38:42.646]  They go to the tea parties.
[02:38:43.126 --> 02:38:44.326]  MSNBC told me this.
[02:38:44.366 --> 02:38:45.127]  So did Salon.
[02:38:45.147 --> 02:38:46.027]  So did the New York Times.
[02:38:47.466 --> 02:38:52.268]  Everywhere they go, the majority of people say, I'm here because of Alex Jones.
[02:38:52.649 --> 02:38:54.570]  Now, you notice you don't see me at those tea parties.
[02:38:54.610 --> 02:39:05.855]  I've been invited to a lot of them, but I don't go because I'm busy, A. B, I get there provocateurs, then try to stir stuff up and, you know, run up, and it only takes two or three of them to claim, you're not supposed to be here.
[02:39:05.875 --> 02:39:09.897]  Then they say I crashed it or something, and it becomes a media staged event.
[02:39:09.917 --> 02:39:13.579]  There's a lot of COINTELPRO out there, also a lot of just jealous, mentally ill people.
[02:39:15.220 --> 02:39:19.001]  In the final equation here, ladies and gentlemen, they're in a lot of trouble.
[02:39:19.461 --> 02:39:20.342]  And they know they are.
[02:39:21.362 --> 02:39:22.742]  So, get it out there.
[02:39:23.042 --> 02:39:26.744]  Chris Matthews supports terrorists that attack and kill police.
[02:39:27.364 --> 02:39:35.286]  Meanwhile, he wants to say, I'm calling for killing cops, which he does later in this video and in the documentary coming out tonight, according to the script we have.
[02:39:35.826 --> 02:39:37.887]  Now, I want to turn to Aaron Dykes now, because
[02:39:39.440 --> 02:39:41.801]  I mean, here's an article out of the London Independent.
[02:39:41.961 --> 02:39:46.244]  UK eugenicists demand we need a global initiative for population reduction.
[02:39:46.544 --> 02:39:48.285]  That's the London Independent today.
[02:39:49.145 --> 02:39:50.146]  I've got another one here.
[02:39:50.186 --> 02:39:52.327]  Lieberman says pay $1 a day for climate.
[02:39:52.587 --> 02:39:53.987]  They've got the carbon tax back.
[02:39:55.168 --> 02:39:57.509]  BP was founding member of cap-and-trade lobby.
[02:39:57.729 --> 02:40:00.091]  They admit with the cap-and-trade it's to shut down society.
[02:40:00.331 --> 02:40:01.311]  Here's CNN money.
[02:40:01.711 --> 02:40:03.292]  The $600 billion challenge.
[02:40:03.652 --> 02:40:07.795]  Bill Gates, Melinda Gates, and Warren Buffett are asking the nation's billionaires to pledge
[02:40:08.835 --> 02:40:16.027]  ...to give at least half their net worth to charity, if their lifetimes, or at death, if their campaign succeeds, it could change the face of philanthropy.
[02:40:16.488 --> 02:40:20.114]  Then you study the philanthropy, you find out both of them are eugenicists...
[02:40:21.314 --> 02:40:25.215]  In fact, pull up the headline, World's Ultra-Rich Meat and Cigarette Disgust Population.
[02:40:25.775 --> 02:40:35.998]  You find out that they're allowed to make their money tax-free, keep it, make more money, as long as the interest on that money goes for eugenics.
[02:40:36.418 --> 02:40:41.680]  And I wanted to call Aaron Dykstin, because he's part of research for our new eugenics slash chemtrail film.
[02:40:42.540 --> 02:40:50.022]  You have gone over the 70-plus programs, at least 10 of them, 30-plus to some degree, but at least 10 of them directly
[02:40:50.362 --> 02:40:53.285]  Oh, it's so scary that it's accurate.
[02:41:09.239 --> 02:41:15.022]  And all these computer people have been into population reduction over the past half century.
[02:41:15.062 --> 02:41:17.024]  IBM was founded to track blacks.
[02:41:17.204 --> 02:41:19.605]  And Bill Gates' father's been involved with the population.
[02:41:19.725 --> 02:41:21.966]  IBM machines were used on the Jews with the numbers.
[02:41:22.567 --> 02:41:26.789]  Everywhere you look you'll find all those computer companies deep, deep, deep into eugenics.
[02:41:26.809 --> 02:41:37.215]  So it's all the more troubling that all of these programs are for sterilization, contraceptives, all mixed with vaccine and scary sounding nanotechnology.
[02:41:37.675 --> 02:41:39.736]  Uh, which are all meant to enhance the vaccines.
[02:41:40.257 --> 02:41:43.919]  So... And these are, some of these are vaccines that reprogram the brain so you'll behave yourself.
[02:41:44.359 --> 02:41:46.420]  Don't, it's like the pod people, it's body snatcher.
[02:41:46.660 --> 02:41:48.201]  Take this, you'll be one of us now.
[02:41:48.461 --> 02:41:53.444]  And they're openly saying, they're laughing, it doesn't matter if we don't want to take it, they're just gonna put it in the food and spray it on us.
[02:41:53.684 --> 02:41:54.245]  Ha ha ha!
[02:41:54.665 --> 02:41:58.067]  Yeah, we know there's been... Ha ha ha, I'm Chris Matthews, I'm a big fat bastard, excuse me.
[02:41:59.471 --> 02:42:02.876]  I mean, they've forced down covert sterilization over the years.
[02:42:03.237 --> 02:42:09.245]  Sometimes it's been in vaccines and all of a sudden we're supposed to trust Bill Gates when he turns into a mad scientist.
[02:42:09.265 --> 02:42:14.393]  And we've got hundreds of mainstream reports where they add sterilization compounds to the vaccines to sterilize.
[02:42:14.929 --> 02:42:20.252]  Yeah, and it's always hidden and lied to African villages, and they riot, and they just do it anyway.
[02:42:20.552 --> 02:42:32.917]  And now we have at least 10 programs for contraceptives or sterilization, which can be covertly slipped into vaccines, into foods, water, you name it, because a lot of it is based on nanotechnology.
[02:42:32.978 --> 02:42:37.680]  Take this one, a zeolite hydrogel nano-mop for contraception.
[02:42:38.040 --> 02:42:40.241]  It attacks the fructose in sperm,
[02:42:40.632 --> 02:42:43.713]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[02:43:04.463 --> 02:43:04.783]  I think so.
[02:43:19.249 --> 02:43:25.111]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems.
[02:43:25.391 --> 02:43:29.913]  From the smallest to the largest systems, BigBerkyWaterFilters.com has what you need.

[02:44:03.385 --> 02:44:04.306]  Tyranny is here.
[02:44:04.646 --> 02:44:08.229]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:44:08.329 --> 02:44:10.791]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:44:10.811 --> 02:44:16.275]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:44:16.675 --> 02:44:22.900]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:44:23.340 --> 02:44:28.884]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:44:29.305 --> 02:44:33.007]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:44:33.508 --> 02:44:37.531]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:44:37.791 --> 02:44:43.315]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:44:43.735 --> 02:44:46.737]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:44:47.298 --> 02:44:48.659]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:44:49.239 --> 02:44:49.760]  It's here.

[02:44:58.829 --> 02:44:59.169]  Fact.
[02:44:59.409 --> 02:45:00.750]  Four million people in the U.S.
[02:45:00.771 --> 02:45:02.572]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[02:45:02.893 --> 02:45:03.213]  Fact.
[02:45:03.413 --> 02:45:06.776]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the eighth leading cause of death among Americans.
[02:45:07.097 --> 02:45:07.437]  Fact.
[02:45:07.717 --> 02:45:13.042]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[02:45:13.243 --> 02:45:13.503]  Fact.
[02:45:13.923 --> 02:45:17.705]  1 in 10 Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[02:45:18.025 --> 02:45:18.386]  Fact!
[02:45:18.626 --> 02:45:22.368]  Anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.

[02:46:05.393 --> 02:46:06.714]  There's the Times of London.
[02:46:06.794 --> 02:46:10.417]  Billionaire club in bid to curb overpopulations.
[02:46:10.477 --> 02:46:16.803]  America's richest people meet to discuss ways of transcending.
[02:46:16.823 --> 02:46:18.464]  I'm reading that from across the room.
[02:46:18.484 --> 02:46:19.065]  Is that what it says?
[02:46:19.105 --> 02:46:19.725]  Transcending?
[02:46:20.226 --> 02:46:24.530]  A disastrous environmental, social and industrial threat.
[02:46:25.771 --> 02:46:29.414]  Again, they've got computer monitors where they put articles up that I asked for across the room.
[02:46:30.435 --> 02:46:31.576]  Is that word transcend?
[02:46:32.938 --> 02:46:33.618]  It is Transcend.
[02:46:33.678 --> 02:46:34.099]  Okay, good.
[02:46:34.139 --> 02:46:36.200]  I'm just reading it from about 10 feet away and it's small.
[02:46:36.960 --> 02:46:38.521]  You know, that's all they talk about.
[02:46:38.561 --> 02:46:39.402]  That's all they do.
[02:46:39.462 --> 02:46:40.582]  It's in all the documents.
[02:46:41.583 --> 02:46:44.885]  A lot of the transhumanists and eugenicists say they want to kill all humans.
[02:46:45.245 --> 02:46:47.767]  That humans are a disease and shouldn't even be allowed off planet.
[02:46:48.507 --> 02:46:49.627]  Watson has those quotes.
[02:46:49.667 --> 02:46:50.868]  That's why I said the debate is 80%.
[02:46:51.848 --> 02:46:52.649]  That's the lowest.
[02:46:53.009 --> 02:46:53.809]  That's the liberals.
[02:46:53.849 --> 02:46:54.729]  We should only kill 80.
[02:46:54.989 --> 02:46:56.610]  Ted Turner says 90.
[02:46:57.610 --> 02:46:58.891]  Prince Philip says 80 to 90.
[02:46:59.031 --> 02:47:02.532]  And they're all, you know, a lot of people attack them as traitors.
[02:47:02.572 --> 02:47:04.793]  They say, no, you must kill all humans.
[02:47:05.513 --> 02:47:06.754]  You know, humans are a scourge.
[02:47:08.174 --> 02:47:12.916]  But I'm not allowed to talk about that, even though they're in the news today calling for global one-child policies, Aaron.
[02:47:13.636 --> 02:47:14.997]  Keep going through the vaccines, though.
[02:47:15.017 --> 02:47:15.357]  I'm sorry.
[02:47:16.499 --> 02:47:19.641]  Well, there's a lot of vaccine as well as contraceptive stuff.
[02:47:20.062 --> 02:47:27.808]  One of the scarier ones that has already been reported is they're going to use ultrasound as a long-term reversible male contraceptive.
[02:47:28.428 --> 02:47:31.130]  But it effectively sterilizes you because you have to go back in.
[02:47:32.031 --> 02:47:38.116]  They have a lot of... But it's okay to ultrasound babies, even though it's been linked to brain damage, but it does fry your sperm.
[02:47:38.516 --> 02:47:39.337]  But that's okay.
[02:47:39.937 --> 02:47:41.178]  Just do it to your baby's brain.
[02:47:41.198 --> 02:47:41.819]  We're the government.
[02:47:42.512 --> 02:47:54.698]  I mean, we have a scientific dictatorship attacking sperm, you know, the means of reproduction at a fundamental level, attacking it, learning how to disassemble it in order, in the name of attacking HIV virus.
[02:47:55.298 --> 02:48:01.261]  They have contraceptives for women that are supposed to fight sexually transmitted diseases and HIV.
[02:48:01.281 --> 02:48:05.123]  It just goes on and on.
[02:48:05.344 --> 02:48:06.184]  It's really scary.
[02:48:07.144 --> 02:48:12.067]  Some of the vaccines include a laser vaccine.
[02:48:12.914 --> 02:48:13.094]  I don't
[02:48:33.379 --> 02:48:42.021]  Which will deliver a vaccine upon contact with human sweat and deliver, um, you know, that one targets the hair follicles.
[02:48:42.201 --> 02:48:43.581]  And that's released on the air.
[02:48:44.901 --> 02:48:47.262]  And then they have other things where they use bacteria.
[02:48:47.322 --> 02:48:57.524]  And Bill Gates' dad, CIA Planned Parenthood board member, openly calls a subhuman trash, and he's running around giggling with airborne sterilants that mimic pollen.
[02:48:57.804 --> 02:48:59.464]  Hope you enjoy yourself out there!
[02:49:01.255 --> 02:49:06.121]  Well, we're not supposed to talk about that because Chris Matthews, you know, sits up there on his high horse.
[02:49:06.141 --> 02:49:06.942]  There's too many of us.
[02:49:07.202 --> 02:49:09.825]  How about you get the hell off the planet, Chris Matthews?
[02:49:10.085 --> 02:49:15.011]  You're the one supporting all the wars and the violence with your poverty-pimped, predator-drawn garbage.
[02:49:15.452 --> 02:49:20.698]  How about you get out of our lives, you sicko control freak who wants to get rid of us so you can have the Earth for yourself?
[02:49:21.498 --> 02:49:23.299]  The good news is, people know who you are.
[02:49:23.539 --> 02:49:24.839]  You Bill Air's terrorist.
[02:49:25.100 --> 02:49:26.380]  You're a supporter of terrorists.
[02:49:26.480 --> 02:49:27.401]  You are a terrorist.
[02:49:27.721 --> 02:49:30.242]  You are somebody that wants to shut down the Bill of Rights in America.
[02:49:30.482 --> 02:49:31.622]  And you're going to be defeated.
[02:49:31.662 --> 02:49:33.403]  You can't kill an idea, Matthews.
[02:49:33.723 --> 02:49:34.303]  Understand that.
[02:49:34.343 --> 02:49:36.184]  You can't kill an idea whose time has come.
[02:49:36.524 --> 02:49:39.345]  You and all your globalist trash in both political parties.
[02:49:39.685 --> 02:49:41.126]  It's over, scumbag!
[02:49:41.326 --> 02:49:42.367]  We know who you are!
[02:49:42.387 --> 02:49:42.847]  Go ahead.
[02:49:43.687 --> 02:49:48.713]  It's just we've studied these evil eugenicists for what they've been doing over the past century.
[02:49:48.733 --> 02:49:50.555]  You and I have spent years looking at this.
[02:49:50.895 --> 02:49:56.882]  And every time they use all the new computer technology to catalog people they want to exterminate.
[02:49:57.222 --> 02:49:58.383]  Now they're using all the vaccines.
[02:49:58.403 --> 02:50:02.268]  They've been taking our blood at birth, now admitted for Pentagon bioweapons on every person.
[02:50:02.808 --> 02:50:13.154]  Yeah, they develop this nanotechnology and then use it immediately for vaccines, for reproduction of weird, you know, antigens and bacteriophages, and for sterilization.
[02:50:13.194 --> 02:50:14.055]  We know what they've been on.
[02:50:14.075 --> 02:50:15.035]  He's totally obsessed!
[02:50:15.055 --> 02:50:16.236]  He admits sterilize you!
[02:50:16.576 --> 02:50:19.398]  And hey, when you go into the doctors, it'll all be compartmentalized.
[02:50:19.498 --> 02:50:20.418]  Gee, Mr. Jones.
[02:50:20.438 --> 02:50:21.559]  Gee, Mrs. Johnson.
[02:50:21.579 --> 02:50:23.820]  You know, we don't know why you're sterilized.
[02:50:24.120 --> 02:50:27.682]  But don't worry, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation happens to have a drug that'll treat that.
[02:50:28.383 --> 02:50:29.544]  You know, just buy it from them.
[02:50:30.584 --> 02:50:32.845]  Oh, and he's also into weather control and chemtrails.
[02:50:33.305 --> 02:50:35.305]  He's huge into that, patenting all that.
[02:50:35.325 --> 02:50:36.085]  We're out of time.
[02:50:36.125 --> 02:50:36.706]  Great job, Aaron.
[02:50:36.726 --> 02:50:38.206]  We'll have to do more on it this week.
[02:50:38.246 --> 02:50:38.846]  Great job, Chris.

[02:50:43.808 --> 02:50:51.369]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lung
