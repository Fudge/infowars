[00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:09.830]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.411]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:12.953]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.953 --> 00:00:17.156]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.156 --> 00:00:21.220]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.764]  It is Monday, my friends, Monday, the 17th day of May 2010.
[00:00:43.764 --> 00:00:59.753]  We normally have Max Keiser on once a month, but I had him on last week because of all the market turmoil that is only intensifying in Asia, Europe, and the United States, centered in and around not just Greece, but of course Portugal, Spain, and other members of the European Union.
[00:00:59.753 --> 00:01:02.755]  Keiser will be joining us in the third hour today.
[00:01:03.455 --> 00:01:16.903]  And Gary Franchi, producer of Don't Tread on Me, will be joining us in the last hour to talk about the state's rights nullification movement and the movement to elect good sheriffs that will defend and restore the republic.
[00:01:16.903 --> 00:01:21.045]  So, serious solutions in the last hour of transmission today.
[00:01:24.048 --> 00:01:28.772]  Our top story is going to go up in about 15 minutes at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:28.772 --> 00:01:32.095]  Paul Watson is writing it right now.
[00:01:32.095 --> 00:01:49.549]  Audio has been discovered of Cass Sunstein, the White House regulations arm, who two years ago wrote white papers for the Chicago Law School as well as Harvard in a joint operation, calling for the absolute end of free speech and the arrest of anyone the government disagrees with.
[00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.733]  Of course, there are as many as seven others that Watson's posting videos in the article on.
[00:01:55.733 --> 00:02:01.517]  Other czars calling for absolute draconian attacks on free speech.
[00:02:01.517 --> 00:02:13.745]  And of course, we now have gotten more and more of the quotes when she was a law clerk and then a lawyer, never been a judge, of Kagan, the new Supreme Court nominee, Elena Kagan.
[00:02:13.745 --> 00:02:19.068]  And here's the Hill newspaper, new GOP argument against Kagan, she could ban books.
[00:02:19.068 --> 00:02:20.009]  That's not an argument.
[00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:33.352]  If I argue that the head of the Manson murders is Charlie Manson, he's been convicted of that and he admits he did it.
[00:02:33.352 --> 00:02:38.393]  He admits he ordered Sharon Tate to be butchered.
[00:02:38.393 --> 00:02:40.554]  Okay, that's not arguing that.
[00:02:41.981 --> 00:02:47.066]  It's not arguing the fact that the Atlantic Ocean is off the coast of New York City.
[00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:51.271]  It's not arguing the fact that the Gulf of Mexico's got oil all over it.
[00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:57.096]  It's not arguing that there's a world government that's been set up that's totally illegal and oppressive and unelected.
[00:02:57.096 --> 00:02:58.998]  It's a public fact!
[00:02:58.998 --> 00:02:59.419]  Okay?
[00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:00.820]  So I'm sick of it!
[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.161]  I'm sick of it!
[00:03:02.161 --> 00:03:04.904]  So I called Watson this morning and said, I want about...
[00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:22.014]  Earlier this morning, and I said, I want you to write an article with it all, because we keep putting out articles every day or two with new things discovered on Kagan, where she's an anti-Second Amendment, anti-free speech thug.
[00:03:22.014 --> 00:03:24.596]  I mean, she's too extreme for China.
[00:03:24.596 --> 00:03:25.416]  Communist China.
[00:03:25.416 --> 00:03:27.438]  Now, they'd love her in North Korea.
[00:03:27.438 --> 00:03:28.538]  Pol Pot would have loved her.
[00:03:28.538 --> 00:03:33.241]  I mean, she's that bad.
[00:03:33.241 --> 00:03:34.542]  She's that bad.
[00:03:35.572 --> 00:03:38.873]  And he goes, well, okay, I'll do that later in the day, Alex.
[00:03:38.873 --> 00:03:41.854]  I'm working on a Cass Sunstein article.
[00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:47.816]  And we've got the audio, and it dovetails with all of the written policy papers he's put out.
[00:03:47.816 --> 00:03:56.738]  And this gives us a very clear image of how they're going to go after free speech in America, and how they're going to phase it in.
[00:03:56.738 --> 00:04:00.159]  And they do want the Fairness Doctrine for every website.
[00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:03.320]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com,
[00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:20.575]  You will not be able to go to my website and read the news that we link to in the articles we write before it's been approved by the federal government, and then after they approve it, if they so feel that that's what they should do, you have to then post in it what they want.
[00:04:20.575 --> 00:04:22.836]  Quote, the other side.
[00:04:22.836 --> 00:04:34.740]  So I guess if we write an article saying the health care bill was written by the insurance companies, which is a public fact, now admitted, I'd have to then post links and articles by the government and the media lying in our information.
[00:04:36.351 --> 00:04:44.937]  Or, I say page 15 of the bill doesn't let you buy your own private insurance, but clearly states you have to buy what the government approves.
[00:04:44.937 --> 00:04:47.939]  Just like FEMA flood insurance, which is a fact.
[00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:48.940]  No, I couldn't do that.
[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.982]  I'd have to mix their lies in.
[00:04:51.982 --> 00:04:54.124]  Look, they're in trouble and they know it.
[00:04:54.124 --> 00:04:56.285]  And they're coming after the internet and your free speech.
[00:04:56.285 --> 00:04:57.706]  We're going to cover that and a lot more.
[00:04:57.706 --> 00:04:58.187]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.906 --> 00:05:05.867]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:05.867 --> 00:05:14.728]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:05:14.728 --> 00:05:19.349]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:30.171]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:05:30.811 --> 00:05:40.314]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:40.314 --> 00:05:45.756]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.

[00:06:25.743 --> 00:06:30.766]  ...exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:30.766 --> 00:06:34.968]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:06:34.968 --> 00:06:39.270]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:45.213]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:45.213 --> 00:06:48.755]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:48.755 --> 00:06:50.736]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:50.736 --> 00:06:51.176]  It's here.

[00:08:00.631 --> 00:08:06.033]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.033 --> 00:08:08.314]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:19.471 --> 00:08:28.523]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down over 150 points right now and dropping fast.
[00:08:28.523 --> 00:08:34.230]  We'll continue to watch this data stream of information.
[00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:35.872]  Here's some of the financial news.
[00:08:36.693 --> 00:08:47.397]  With local gold inventories depleted, panicking German dealers stage run on Krugerrands, driving up the price in Europe to all-time record highs.
[00:08:47.397 --> 00:08:50.718]  It keeps breaking that high every day of open trading.
[00:08:50.718 --> 00:08:54.120]  The Financial Times of London and Zero Hedge are reporting.
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.101]  That's all up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:08:57.561 --> 00:09:02.805]  Another key article by Paul Joseph Watson this morning that breaks it all down, the latest info.
[00:09:02.805 --> 00:09:07.328]  Financial terrorists want global currency, global central bank.
[00:09:07.328 --> 00:09:13.232]  And he shows the evidence that the IMF and World Bank, Federal Reserve partnered are raiding the Europe.
[00:09:13.232 --> 00:09:19.336]  They've even had ministers admit that, the EU system, to try to plunge it to bolster the dollar.
[00:09:19.336 --> 00:09:23.859]  Then they will lower the dollar in concert later to the Euro level.
[00:09:23.859 --> 00:09:26.120]  So this is concerted, organized,
[00:09:27.381 --> 00:09:27.621]  I think?
[00:09:47.657 --> 00:09:48.057]  We're good to go.
[00:10:16.155 --> 00:10:22.778]  We'll send some mid-level trader in our system to jail for six months.
[00:10:22.778 --> 00:10:29.761]  I mean, that's basically how they like to run their little scams.
[00:10:29.761 --> 00:10:35.204]  With local gold inventories depleted, again, panicking, a German dealer stage run on Krugerrands.
[00:10:35.204 --> 00:10:36.464]  That is important news.
[00:10:36.464 --> 00:10:39.886]  We'll talk about that with Max Keiser coming up.
[00:10:40.466 --> 00:10:47.130]  Also, White House's Volcker joins Merkel and others, saying future of the euro is in doubt.
[00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:53.513]  Europe's debt troubles could undermine its currency, White House adviser Paul Volcker said over the weekend.
[00:10:53.513 --> 00:10:57.915]  Trichet calls for more control in the euro zones.
[00:10:57.915 --> 00:11:00.817]  Europe's top central banker has rubbished
[00:11:01.357 --> 00:11:02.218]  We're good to go.
[00:11:31.837 --> 00:11:33.738]  European rich nations.
[00:11:33.738 --> 00:11:35.998]  France would not even make the cut.
[00:11:35.998 --> 00:11:40.680]  In fact, here's a headline from Business Insider with links to the London Telegraph.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.720]  Ambrose Evans Pritchard today.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:51.563]  Germans fantasize about new Reich nation currency or new land currency block that doesn't even include France.
[00:11:52.423 --> 00:12:09.642]  Tonight's must-read comes from Ambrose Evans Pritchard at The Telegraph, who offers some clear views on why the EU's big shock-and-awe rescue plan is not having its desired result, and why it hasn't fully instilled confidence.
[00:12:09.642 --> 00:12:11.203]  Again, it's tonight in Europe.
[00:12:11.203 --> 00:12:12.324]  This article just came out.
[00:12:14.895 --> 00:12:23.652]  It is this whole insistence on the part of leaders that the goal was to go after the wolf pack of speculators.
[00:12:25.031 --> 00:12:32.757]  This screams willful ignorance of the real structural problems at hand, even if it is just rhetorical.
[00:12:32.757 --> 00:12:43.465]  Yeah, I mean the very central bankers that are raiding their own European Union, I mean that's the European Union was designed to rob Europe, are now claiming that this isn't going on.
[00:12:43.465 --> 00:12:47.208]  Then there are the continuing concerns about the bailout mechanism.
[00:12:47.208 --> 00:12:47.928]  Beyond that,
[00:12:48.869 --> 00:12:51.872]  Europe is losing the Germans.
[00:12:51.872 --> 00:12:54.315]  The Germans are threatening to pull out.
[00:12:54.315 --> 00:13:00.721]  Chancellor Merkel has put the best face on a deal that has so damaged her leadership.
[00:13:00.721 --> 00:13:07.268]  If the Euro fails and Europe fails and the idea of the European Union fails, she said, too late!
[00:13:07.268 --> 00:13:09.129]  I think the German nation is moving on.
[00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:24.858]  I was struck by a piece in the Frankfurter Allemagente proposing a new hard currency made up of the German, Austrian, Finland, the Czech Republic, Poland, but without France.
[00:13:24.858 --> 00:13:37.724]  The piece entitled, The Alternative Says Deflation Policies May Push Greece to the Brink of Civil War, and concludes that Europe would be better off if it abandoned the attempt to hold together two
[00:13:39.941 --> 00:13:41.427]  Incompatible halves.
[00:13:41.427 --> 00:13:45.481]  It can be done, the prestigious newspaper said.
[00:13:46.772 --> 00:13:55.438]  And then it goes on with Nicolas Sarkozy, the embattled French president, almost lost control of their parliament.
[00:13:55.438 --> 00:14:00.141]  Germany, in regional elections, they have them staggered.
[00:14:00.141 --> 00:14:04.984]  Merkel is very close to losing control, just like Brown was a month ago, and now he's gone.
[00:14:04.984 --> 00:14:09.287]  I mean, the point is, the people are going to throw these people out on their hind ends.
[00:14:09.287 --> 00:14:11.949]  And they're not drinking fluoride in Germany.
[00:14:11.949 --> 00:14:15.611]  They're not as dumbed down in Deutschland as we are here.
[00:14:16.792 --> 00:14:26.980]  And they do not have electronic voting machines in all of their provinces like we do here, our states, and they actually have some voting!
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:36.648]  So bye-bye Merkel, bye-bye Sarkozy, bye-bye Greek leaders, bye-bye anybody, bye-bye Gordon Brown.
[00:14:36.648 --> 00:14:45.354]  And look, it took people six years to wake up to Bush being a fraud, it took them less than a year in polls to wake up to Obama being a fraud, 80 plus percent approval ratings, now down at 40.
[00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:56.675]  And when they put in Mr. Cameron, and he's now in there, it'll take months for the Brits to wake up to this being a bait and switch.
[00:14:56.675 --> 00:14:58.576]  See, what took years...
[00:15:00.014 --> 00:15:01.115]  Now it takes months.
[00:15:01.115 --> 00:15:04.037]  The wake-up is much, much faster now.
[00:15:04.037 --> 00:15:08.140]  And that's why the globalists are going to start a big war with Iran as a distraction.
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:12.063]  That's why they'll probably stage terror attacks as a distraction from what they're doing.
[00:15:12.063 --> 00:15:15.705]  Because this is a make-it-or-break-it scenario.
[00:15:15.705 --> 00:15:19.248]  This is an all-in, all chips on the table.
[00:15:19.248 --> 00:15:20.969]  They've laid their cards on the table.
[00:15:20.969 --> 00:15:23.331]  They are going all the way.
[00:15:23.331 --> 00:15:24.672]  They're not backing off.
[00:15:24.672 --> 00:15:25.532]  They're not going to stop.
[00:15:25.532 --> 00:15:26.173]  They're in trouble.
[00:15:27.622 --> 00:15:28.443]  Here's the analogy.
[00:15:28.443 --> 00:15:32.286]  They are a race car in the final lap.
[00:15:32.286 --> 00:15:41.233]  They are only about four cars ahead of the anti-globalist movements around the planet, who are in second place.
[00:15:41.233 --> 00:15:47.038]  Our engine is sputtering, it's got a little smoke coming out of it, and we're missing a fender.
[00:15:48.874 --> 00:15:52.497]  But the banker's car is on fire.
[00:15:52.497 --> 00:15:56.241]  The banker's car has got flames coming out of the engine.
[00:15:56.241 --> 00:15:58.062]  It's blowing gaskets.
[00:15:58.062 --> 00:16:00.544]  It is going to blow any second.
[00:16:00.544 --> 00:16:07.671]  And they're racing down the final stretch, and I don't know if they're going to make it across.
[00:16:07.671 --> 00:16:12.455]  If they don't stage terror attacks and start new wars, they're not going to make it across the finish line.
[00:16:14.147 --> 00:16:22.053]  Will probably blow up as they cross the finish line, engulfing their system in flames, even if they start a war.
[00:16:22.053 --> 00:16:23.654]  But they can't stop.
[00:16:23.654 --> 00:16:24.615]  It's their nature.
[00:16:24.615 --> 00:16:32.221]  The reason they're in power is they're so bold, they are brave, and they're cunning, and they're intelligent, and they're totally ruthless and evil.
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.461]  And so we have just got to focus.
[00:16:35.461 --> 00:16:39.544]  We've got to get in the zone in our race car and just don't make mistakes.
[00:16:39.544 --> 00:16:43.006]  Don't think we've got it on this final stretch.
[00:16:43.006 --> 00:16:44.707]  And there's another thing.
[00:16:44.707 --> 00:16:45.827]  There's all the confusion.
[00:16:45.827 --> 00:16:49.490]  The smoke pouring off of the car three or four lengths ahead of us.
[00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:51.171]  The flames coming off of it.
[00:16:51.171 --> 00:16:54.713]  The oil leaking can make us go into the wall.
[00:16:55.583 --> 00:16:58.888]  Or can make us spin out and go into all the other cars behind us.
[00:16:58.888 --> 00:17:01.751]  I mean, this is serious, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:01.751 --> 00:17:04.856]  Their car is on fire right now.
[00:17:04.856 --> 00:17:10.463]  Our engine is hammering and starting to really make some dangerous noises here.
[00:17:11.605 --> 00:17:23.440]  You know, we're pressing on the accelerator and we can notice that we're starting to keep the momentum up, but more smoke comes out of our engine when we press down on the pedal.
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:27.926]  And so there's your analogy, your NASCAR analogy for the day, but this is it, okay?
[00:17:28.426 --> 00:17:29.706]  This is it.
[00:17:29.706 --> 00:17:31.407]  And it's only going to get crazier.
[00:17:31.407 --> 00:17:32.687]  It's a quickening.
[00:17:32.687 --> 00:17:39.089]  It's an acceleration from this point on, the likes of which this planet has never seen.
[00:17:39.089 --> 00:17:46.372]  The next year, the next two years, the next three years, the next decade is going to have fireworks that are going to be off the charts.
[00:17:46.372 --> 00:17:49.953]  The feds are clearly going with race war here in the United States.
[00:17:50.413 --> 00:17:52.996]  They decided to make it Anglos versus Hispanics.
[00:17:52.996 --> 00:17:54.478]  We've got to try to stop that.
[00:17:54.478 --> 00:17:56.940]  They're clearly going with a war with Iran.
[00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:02.267]  They're clearly going with domestic attacks to blame it on conservatives, libertarians, and veterans.
[00:18:02.267 --> 00:18:04.829]  We know the different situation.
[00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:10.895]  The different things they're doing in the situation we're in, and it's just going to get wilder.
[00:18:10.895 --> 00:18:14.297]  I mean, it gives me chills just to talk about it.
[00:18:14.297 --> 00:18:21.603]  The situation we're all in together here, and we've got to come together as freedom lovers, as Americans, as patriots.
[00:18:21.603 --> 00:18:23.925]  People have to choose a side.
[00:18:23.925 --> 00:18:27.988]  If you've tuned into this show over the years and you haven't spoken up and you haven't been public,
[00:18:28.749 --> 00:18:32.150]  And you haven't gotten involved, but you know this information is accurate.
[00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:34.311]  You've done the research for yourself.
[00:18:34.311 --> 00:18:35.771]  You've got to choose sides.
[00:18:35.771 --> 00:18:37.932]  You can't sit there in the middle of the road.
[00:18:37.932 --> 00:18:43.193]  You can't, you know, sit there and not choose sides.
[00:18:43.193 --> 00:18:51.415]  If you just sit in the middle, you've basically given aid to the enemy and destroyed yourself in the process for sure.
[00:18:51.415 --> 00:18:57.057]  It is better to choose the side of telling the truth, standing up against the New World Order, screaming your bloody
[00:18:58.655 --> 00:19:03.756]  Brains out, just as hardcore as you can, warning everyone.
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:10.143]  Everybody out there should be running around like chickens with your head cut off right now, like I do, warning everybody.
[00:19:10.143 --> 00:19:21.449]  That's the only thing that's going to break the silence, break the conditioning, shake people out of their myopic, mind-numbed, mesmerized, mind-controlled worldview.
[00:19:21.449 --> 00:19:29.894]  Now, a lot of people have been shaken out of their sleep, but they still are rubbing their eyes and don't know exactly what's going on, but they smell fire.
[00:19:29.894 --> 00:19:31.134]  They smell smoke in the house.
[00:19:31.134 --> 00:19:32.075]  They know something's wrong.
[00:19:33.308 --> 00:19:42.393]  We've got to be there to explain to them exactly what happened, who the enemy is, and that world government is being established right now out of this engineered crisis.
[00:19:42.393 --> 00:19:47.036]  Now, I'm going to continue with what's happening with the economy later in the hour.
[00:19:47.036 --> 00:19:49.677]  I want to come back with the attack on free speech.
[00:19:49.677 --> 00:19:52.619]  This is so incredibly important.
[00:19:52.619 --> 00:19:55.700]  Straight ahead, right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:56.361]  Please stay with us.
[00:20:01.172 --> 00:20:01.753]  Fact.
[00:20:01.753 --> 00:20:03.114]  Four million people in the U.S.
[00:20:03.114 --> 00:20:05.235]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[00:20:05.235 --> 00:20:05.756]  Fact.
[00:20:05.756 --> 00:20:09.438]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the eighth leading cause of death among Americans.
[00:20:09.438 --> 00:20:10.059]  Fact.
[00:20:10.059 --> 00:20:15.563]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[00:20:15.563 --> 00:20:16.204]  Fact.
[00:20:16.204 --> 00:20:20.387]  One in ten Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[00:20:20.387 --> 00:20:20.987]  Fact.
[00:20:20.987 --> 00:20:24.950]  Anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.
[00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:31.015]  Protect your liver by visiting ResearchedHerbs.com and learning more about the world's number one selling all-natural

[00:21:01.423 --> 00:21:05.804]  The new World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food.
[00:21:05.804 --> 00:21:07.605]  Genetically modifying.
[00:21:07.605 --> 00:21:12.966]  Mixing vegetables with animals and now experimenting with viruses.
[00:21:12.966 --> 00:21:14.006]  Viruses.
[00:21:14.006 --> 00:21:19.748]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[00:21:19.748 --> 00:21:21.928]  Starve or surrender.
[00:21:21.928 --> 00:21:22.709]  Surrender.
[00:21:22.709 --> 00:21:26.510]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:27.390]  What then?
[00:21:30.131 --> 00:21:33.212]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[00:21:33.212 --> 00:21:37.534]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.

[00:22:00.421 --> 00:22:01.481]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:22:01.481 --> 00:22:06.423]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:22:06.423 --> 00:22:14.485]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:22:14.485 --> 00:22:20.066]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:22:20.066 --> 00:22:27.048]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:22:27.348 --> 00:22:32.930]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:38.012]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:22:38.012 --> 00:22:45.955]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:22:45.955 --> 00:22:48.636]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt,
[00:22:49.096 --> 00:22:52.517]  Gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:22:52.517 --> 00:22:56.358]  For more information call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:56.358 --> 00:22:59.979]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:59.979 --> 00:23:05.221]  How well and how fast does heart and body extract work to improve blood circulation?
[00:23:05.221 --> 00:23:05.921]  Listen.
[00:23:05.921 --> 00:23:10.182]  My name is Ellis and I'm 66 years old and I live in Jacksonville, Florida.
[00:23:10.182 --> 00:23:13.143]  Two years ago I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries.
[00:23:13.562 --> 00:23:16.624]  I had 70% blockage in one artery leading to my heart.
[00:23:16.624 --> 00:23:20.407]  They wanted me to go on Plavix, but I refused knowing the negative side effects.
[00:23:20.407 --> 00:23:28.833]  Heart and Body Extract is a unique balance, synergy, and proportion of herbs reaching from head to toe at maximum absorption around 95% at the cellular level.
[00:23:28.833 --> 00:23:31.375]  Within the first month, I felt a dramatic difference.
[00:23:31.375 --> 00:23:35.978]  The heaviness in my legs was reduced, and within two months, I felt completely normal.
[00:23:35.978 --> 00:23:39.761]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is Heart and Body Extract.
[00:23:40.185 --> 00:23:40.445]  Watch me!
[00:23:40.445 --> 00:23:40.765]  Watch me!
[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:16.200]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.101]  You can watch this video up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:24:19.101 --> 00:24:21.922]  We'll be playing the audio coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:21.922 --> 00:24:24.463]  Paul Watson of PrisonPlanet.com is going to be joining us.
[00:24:25.919 --> 00:24:34.046]  Now again, this connects together with this Hill newspaper article, New GOP argument against Kagan.
[00:24:34.046 --> 00:24:35.307]  She could ban books.
[00:24:35.307 --> 00:24:43.555]  Well, no, we have her quotes along these lines, and almost everyone in the White House has made statements like this.
[00:24:43.555 --> 00:24:46.657]  And what, just two weeks ago, one of the board members of the FCC,
[00:24:48.167 --> 00:24:51.268]  Called for government megaphones?
[00:24:51.268 --> 00:24:59.769]  Buying up radio stations for government broadcasting 24-7 and making radio stations take hours a day of government broadcasting?
[00:24:59.769 --> 00:25:01.949]  I mean, what is this, Venezuela?
[00:25:01.949 --> 00:25:03.430]  What is this, Communist China?
[00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:06.070]  I mean, no, we don't have state-run media.
[00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:12.131]  I mean, we basically already do with CNN and MSNBC, but I've had enough of this.
[00:25:12.131 --> 00:25:14.311]  I mean, there's no doubt these people are tyrants.
[00:25:14.311 --> 00:25:15.932]  There's no doubt they're un-American.
[00:25:15.932 --> 00:25:16.912]  They're not just un-American.
[00:25:18.604 --> 00:25:19.407]  They're thugs!
[00:25:19.407 --> 00:25:21.534]  They're crooks by every yardstick!
[00:25:21.534 --> 00:25:22.819]  I mean, come on, people!
[00:25:25.634 --> 00:25:31.798]  And I've got Watson writing another article, it'll be out in the next two hours, where it just boils down all of her quotes, all of her statements.
[00:25:31.798 --> 00:25:40.403]  We have the print-offs from the University of Chicago, Law Review, 200-page article she wrote calling for censorship, attacks on the Second Amendment.
[00:25:40.403 --> 00:25:46.767]  I mean, come on, this woman cannot be, cannot be the next Supreme Court Justice.
[00:25:46.767 --> 00:25:47.708]  No, no, no.
[00:25:49.469 --> 00:25:50.931]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:25:50.931 --> 00:25:54.516]  Not even Bush was this bold with his Supreme Court people.
[00:25:54.516 --> 00:25:56.900]  They never said we're gonna ban your guns.
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.704]  They never said you can't have free speech.
[00:25:59.704 --> 00:26:00.365]  Okay?
[00:26:00.365 --> 00:26:04.130]  And they even reversed Bush on secret arrest of citizens.
[00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:05.051]  And wiretapping.
[00:26:06.087 --> 00:26:15.589]  I mean, because no one is that bold to put people in who are openly anti-free speech, but they were just saying six months ago that Cass Sunstein was the number one pick.
[00:26:15.589 --> 00:26:21.510]  Well, instead, his protege, Elena Kagan, is the one.
[00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:23.891]  I can't even believe they're this bold.
[00:26:23.891 --> 00:26:26.832]  And all of you Democrats out there, shame on you.
[00:26:26.832 --> 00:26:30.992]  Most of you are so silent on the tyrant that Barack Obama is.
[00:26:30.992 --> 00:26:33.093]  I mean, we have never had a president
[00:26:34.332 --> 00:26:34.972]  This bad.
[00:26:34.972 --> 00:26:43.479]  I'm going to tell you right now, this out in the open, with just a crew of larcenous, venomous, vicious...
[00:26:44.716 --> 00:26:47.617]  Destroyers of the Bill of Rights, out in the open!
[00:26:47.617 --> 00:26:49.978]  I mean, they run their flag up at the top of the flagpole.
[00:26:49.978 --> 00:26:50.898]  They are so bold.
[00:26:50.898 --> 00:26:52.639]  I mean, it's like it's White House Chief of Staff.
[00:26:52.639 --> 00:26:54.699]  Video clip after video clip on C-SPAN.
[00:26:54.699 --> 00:26:58.861]  It's speeches saying, arrest, you know, anyone we want.
[00:26:58.861 --> 00:27:01.222]  Ban anybody from owning guns we want.
[00:27:01.222 --> 00:27:07.784]  We're going to make you serve when you graduate from high school in a Homeland Security domestic military.
[00:27:07.784 --> 00:27:08.904]  Everyone must serve.
[00:27:08.904 --> 00:27:10.385]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[00:27:11.533 --> 00:27:12.974]  But here's the article.
[00:27:12.974 --> 00:27:17.378]  Obama czar wants mandatory government propaganda on political websites.
[00:27:17.378 --> 00:27:23.684]  Yes, we know he said he wants to arrest conspiracy theorists and ban free speech, but that was in a law review two and a half years ago.
[00:27:23.684 --> 00:27:23.904]  Now...
[00:27:25.888 --> 00:27:47.143]  We clearly know how they're planning to carry this out, and we have the FCC, what, a month ago or more, saying we want the government to take over the media, and we have a whole bunch of senators, it's more than ten, in the news saying we want fairness doctrine for the internet, and now we have the FCC claiming they have jurisdiction over the internet, because we're here telling the truth.
[00:27:47.143 --> 00:27:49.444]  They can't compete with the truth.
[00:27:49.444 --> 00:27:51.466]  They can't compete with reality.
[00:27:51.986 --> 00:27:56.058]  Their lies have been exposed, so they're just coming right out and saying, okay, we'll just shut down your first page.
[00:27:57.421 --> 00:27:58.661]  This article is so important.
[00:27:58.661 --> 00:28:02.242]  Obama czar wants mandatory government propaganda on political websites.
[00:28:02.242 --> 00:28:22.668]  Disturbing audio has emerged of White House information czar Cass Sunstein, who in a previous white paper called for banning conspiracy theories, including anthropogenic global warming criticism, demanded that websites be mandated by the law to link to opposing information or that pop-ups containing government propaganda could be forcibly included on political blogs.
[00:28:23.547 --> 00:28:29.033]  Well, Google will already pop up messages if you're using them as a search engine over websites saying this is questionable.
[00:28:29.033 --> 00:28:30.555]  They already use these big databases.
[00:28:30.555 --> 00:28:36.942]  They sell universities, high schools, corporations, where they list InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com as bad.
[00:28:36.942 --> 00:28:38.624]  You sure you want to look at this?
[00:28:38.624 --> 00:28:39.646]  This is bad stuff!
[00:28:40.871 --> 00:28:47.179]  In an audio excerpt, yeah it's bad stuff, we actually link to video of these people doing all this.
[00:28:47.179 --> 00:28:57.932]  In an audio excerpt of an interview which was posted on Breitbart TV website today, Sunstein discusses how conservative websites should provide links to liberal websites and vice versa.
[00:28:58.272 --> 00:29:05.914]  Or even how political blogs should be made to include pop-ups that show a quick argument for a competing view.
[00:29:05.914 --> 00:29:14.657]  So now your property, your website, your newspaper, your TV station, your radio station, has to have government propaganda on it.
[00:29:14.657 --> 00:29:19.418]  And we've got this being proposed by the New York Times, a kindler, gentler Internet, too.
[00:29:21.032 --> 00:29:22.392]  And this will just be the beginning.
[00:29:22.392 --> 00:29:25.434]  Once they have the camel inside the tent, they'll just kick us completely out.
[00:29:25.434 --> 00:29:29.495]  This is not camel's nose under the tent flap, this is camel in the tent.
[00:29:29.495 --> 00:29:38.318]  Sunstein said that if this system could be implemented voluntarily, Congress should hold hearings about mandates which would legally force people to dilute their own free speech.
[00:29:38.318 --> 00:29:45.420]  The Harvard professor also said the blogs could be forced to list a random draw of 25 popular websites, such as CNN.
[00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:48.621]  We'll come back, play the audio, talk to Paul Watson.
[00:29:48.621 --> 00:29:49.782]  They're coming after your free speech.
[00:29:50.851 --> 00:29:54.763]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.763 --> 00:29:57.452]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:04.471]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:30:04.471 --> 00:30:10.873]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:30:10.873 --> 00:30:18.255]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:30:18.255 --> 00:30:23.137]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:30:31.801 --> 00:30:35.505]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:30:36.044 --> 00:30:42.828]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:30:42.828 --> 00:30:46.710]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:52.793]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:30:52.793 --> 00:30:53.174]  Thank you.
[00:30:53.174 --> 00:30:56.496]  You may be arrested and or subject to
[00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:05.411]  Tyranny is here.
[00:31:05.411 --> 00:31:09.075]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:31:09.075 --> 00:31:11.577]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:31:11.577 --> 00:31:17.462]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:31:17.462 --> 00:31:23.668]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:31:24.108 --> 00:31:30.093]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:31:30.093 --> 00:31:34.256]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:31:34.256 --> 00:31:38.560]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:44.505]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:31:44.505 --> 00:31:48.068]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:31:48.068 --> 00:31:50.049]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:31:50.049 --> 00:31:50.490]  It's here.

[00:32:06.877 --> 00:32:12.019]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:32:12.019 --> 00:32:18.682]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:32:20.748 --> 00:32:36.890]  They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit They put a diamond gusset in the crotch Where you need it most Blue diamond gussets got it

[00:32:57.403 --> 00:32:57.883]  Others don't.
[00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:24.291]  One life, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:24.291 --> 00:33:26.813]  I'm gonna make a mark for good.
[00:33:26.813 --> 00:33:29.255]  I'm gonna stand up against tyrants.
[00:33:29.255 --> 00:33:37.140]  I have sworn on the altar of God, eternal resistance against every form of tyranny, against the mind of man.
[00:33:39.571 --> 00:33:46.897]  I have sworn eternal resistance against every form of tyranny over the mind of mankind.
[00:33:46.897 --> 00:33:51.201]  And when I make that declaration, you better believe I mean it.
[00:33:51.201 --> 00:33:53.443]  One hundred and ten percent.
[00:33:53.443 --> 00:33:55.004]  Totally committed.
[00:33:55.004 --> 00:33:56.525]  No fear.
[00:33:56.525 --> 00:34:01.169]  We're going in, through, and beyond the New World Order.
[00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:11.271]  Obama czar wants mandatory government propaganda on political websites.
[00:34:11.271 --> 00:34:12.852]  We've got Watson with us.
[00:34:12.852 --> 00:34:20.974]  Watson, be sure and add the link to the FCC board member calling for exactly what Sunstein's calling for a month ago.
[00:34:20.974 --> 00:34:30.917]  He's going to do another master article coming up with all of the quotes of Elena Kagan saying, go after the Second Amendment, ban free speech.
[00:34:30.917 --> 00:34:33.078]  Again, this is finally starting to get into mainstream news.
[00:34:33.078 --> 00:34:35.759]  In the Hill newspaper, she could ban books.
[00:34:36.079 --> 00:34:38.341]  New GOP argument against Kagan.
[00:34:38.341 --> 00:34:39.081]  And who is she?
[00:34:39.081 --> 00:34:40.382]  Another Goldman Sachs minion.
[00:34:40.382 --> 00:34:43.844]  Another Cass Sunstein minion.
[00:34:43.844 --> 00:34:45.966]  So the word is getting out.
[00:34:45.966 --> 00:34:52.250]  If they can give us a new Supreme Court Justice who is openly a tyrant, we're in trouble.
[00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:58.314]  Now, let's go ahead and play this short clip of Cass Sunstein on talk radio.
[00:34:58.314 --> 00:35:00.475]  I mean, he said this publicly.
[00:35:00.475 --> 00:35:00.976]  Here it is.
[00:35:01.883 --> 00:35:05.866]  Sites of one point of view agree to provide links to other sites.
[00:35:05.866 --> 00:35:12.510]  So that if you're reading a conservative magazine, they would provide a link to a liberal site and vice versa.
[00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:16.293]  Just to make it easy for people to get access to competing views.
[00:35:16.293 --> 00:35:22.297]  Or maybe a pop-up on your screen that would show an advertisement or maybe even a quick argument for a competing view.
[00:35:22.297 --> 00:35:26.039]  If we could get voluntary arrangements in that direction, it would be great.
[00:35:26.039 --> 00:35:31.423]  And if we can't get voluntary arrangements, maybe Congress should hold hearings about mandates.
[00:35:32.003 --> 00:35:52.518]  For, now see that's the kind of thing that I think would inflame people because, you know, why should I, in trying to advance my point of view on my website, how can you tell me that I have to direct people's attention to other views that I may find, not just views that I don't like, but views that I might find repugnant or horrid?
[00:35:52.518 --> 00:35:54.940]  And, you know, what constitutes an opposing view?
[00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:58.422]  If I run a site that says, you know, we should all love each other, do I have to have a link to the KKK?
[00:35:59.463 --> 00:36:13.392]  But one person has suggested we might take the 25 most popular sites in the last month, say, of any kind, and require them to have kind of a random draw of links to other sites that are political.
[00:36:13.392 --> 00:36:14.493]  And it would be random.
[00:36:14.493 --> 00:36:25.941]  So that if, let's say, one of the most popular sites is CNN.com, then they would have to have a little link to one or more of the randomly selected sites.
[00:36:26.821 --> 00:36:40.030]  The best would be for this to be done voluntarily, but the word voluntary is a little complicated and sometimes people don't do what's best for our society unless Congress holds hearings or unless the public demands it.
[00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:54.660]  And the idea would be to have a legal mandate as the last resort and to make sure it's as neutral as possible if we have to get there, but to have that as, you know, an ultimate weapon designed to encourage people to do better.
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:37:03.723]  If you're a fan of Glenn Beck or Rush Limbaugh, try reading a few columns on the Huffington Post website.
[00:37:03.723 --> 00:37:07.004]  It may make your blood boil.
[00:37:07.004 --> 00:37:09.765]  Your mind may not be changed.
[00:37:09.765 --> 00:37:14.607]  But the practice of listening to opposing views is essential for effective citizenship.
[00:37:15.669 --> 00:37:16.870]  Yes.
[00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:25.320]  Now, almost all the top 100 news websites are CNN and other mainstream organs like the New York Times, Washington Post.
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:30.747]  And so for the tens of thousands of alternative sites that together in the aggregate are bigger
[00:37:31.267 --> 00:37:32.688]  Then the top sites.
[00:37:32.688 --> 00:37:40.412]  You're now going to have to have their content and their propaganda all over your site and the government, the FCC, has now proposed this.
[00:37:40.412 --> 00:37:46.676]  They're going to set up the web server system and then you've got to basically embed that on your site.
[00:37:46.676 --> 00:37:52.919]  Kind of like last year with the Cash for Clunkers program that horrified everyone when you dialed in to check it.
[00:37:52.919 --> 00:37:58.082]  A message said the federal government is now taking control, this is word for word, of your computer.
[00:37:58.082 --> 00:37:59.763]  It is now property of the US government.
[00:38:00.183 --> 00:38:02.324]  Your files are being scanned.
[00:38:02.324 --> 00:38:06.446]  This is what Internet 2 is.
[00:38:06.446 --> 00:38:14.029]  Where they shut off access to all of the real Internet and force you on to a couple thousand, in their own words, mainstream websites.
[00:38:14.029 --> 00:38:18.030]  So in the new Internet, they don't let the old Internet be repaired, all the grids.
[00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:24.253]  They phase it over to a new system they've already built the hubs for and the communication lines and the new addressing system.
[00:38:25.373 --> 00:38:30.855]  And then there will only be, they actually said, 100 universities and 100 corporations.
[00:38:30.855 --> 00:38:37.477]  Seven years ago they proposed 50 corporations and 50 universities, run by the government, controlled through their mandate.
[00:38:37.477 --> 00:38:48.741]  And then you will be allowed to have a sub-domain, like on YouTube or MySpace or Facebook, and then you have to sign and agree to their rules.
[00:38:48.741 --> 00:38:51.502]  The New York Times and Time Magazine and Newsweek have all called for this as well.
[00:38:52.302 --> 00:39:00.483]  And so then, oh, they can erase any Infowars.com material, any PrisonPlanet.com material.
[00:39:00.483 --> 00:39:06.364]  And so this is just a return to the fairness doctrine of the 60s, 70s, and early 80s that was found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.
[00:39:06.364 --> 00:39:08.545]  I mean, you couldn't have a real talk show.
[00:39:08.545 --> 00:39:21.267]  Alex Jones or Rush Limbaugh or Tom Hartman, you know, a mainline liberal in that paradigm, you couldn't have a show with your own editorial views like a newspaper could.
[00:39:22.242 --> 00:39:23.043]  No.
[00:39:23.043 --> 00:39:25.267]  You could still own a newspaper and write whatever you wanted.
[00:39:25.267 --> 00:39:26.228]  No.
[00:39:26.228 --> 00:39:35.182]  And that's why it was selective enforcement and unconstitutional on so many fronts, not just free speech, but also it was arbitrary, it was selectively enforced, it was discriminatory.
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:38.461]  So, you had to have both sides.
[00:39:38.461 --> 00:39:49.264]  They did have talk shows in big cities, and I remember listening to them when I was a kid, you know, driving around listening to WBAP with my dad, and they'd say, we have the Republican, and we have the Democrat on with us.
[00:39:49.264 --> 00:39:51.205]  Notice Cass Sunstein said that too.
[00:39:51.205 --> 00:40:01.368]  They're going to limit the paradigm to the Republicans and Democrats to cement that controlled power structure of the one party that simply shares power with each other.
[00:40:02.128 --> 00:40:11.821]  Kind of like Andre the Giant and Hulk Hogan, who were good friends, went out and had dinner together, but they at WrestleMania 1, 2, and 3 had big battles in the cage.
[00:40:11.821 --> 00:40:13.002]  It wasn't real.
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:20.042]  Okay, so you can have Hulk Hogan and Andre the Giant, but you can't say, hey, this whole thing's fake and controlled.
[00:40:20.042 --> 00:40:27.523]  We want a true populist constitutional movement at the city and county and state level to take our nation back through the 10th Amendment.
[00:40:27.523 --> 00:40:28.724]  No, you can't have that.
[00:40:28.724 --> 00:40:29.504]  Sorry.
[00:40:29.504 --> 00:40:34.145]  InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and he said this on WBEZ Radio.
[00:40:35.598 --> 00:40:36.358]  I think so.
[00:40:51.104 --> 00:40:57.067]  On free speech, on the Second Amendment, on just everything.
[00:40:57.067 --> 00:40:58.787]  This woman is a tyrant.
[00:40:58.787 --> 00:41:08.352]  But of course, she sat at the feet of Cass Sunstein, who says it's a conspiracy theory that vitamin D and sunlight are good for you.
[00:41:08.352 --> 00:41:12.914]  See, notice when he gave examples in his white paper of what should be banned.
[00:41:12.914 --> 00:41:15.875]  Notice that he gave things that were very broad.
[00:41:21.244 --> 00:41:29.749]  Notice that he used very broad things like, if you don't believe in anthropogenic warming, we can put a tax on you, or ban you, or even arrest you.
[00:41:29.749 --> 00:41:32.851]  He always says it in three parts, like, and that's the message.
[00:41:32.851 --> 00:41:38.854]  We're going to start with a tax, and control you, and monitor you, and create an agency of thought police.
[00:41:38.854 --> 00:41:42.877]  Then we're going to fine you with taxes, and then we're going to arrest you.
[00:41:42.877 --> 00:41:44.317]  See, this is how it's phased in.
[00:41:44.317 --> 00:41:46.639]  This is how Liberty Dies is in phases.
[00:41:48.359 --> 00:41:59.851]  So I now want to go to Paul Watson to break this article down because when you dovetail this with Sunstein and Kagan, Elena Kagan, and
[00:42:02.239 --> 00:42:10.368]  The bill introduced by John McCain and Lieberman that openly says the Pentagon can arrest any citizens.
[00:42:10.368 --> 00:42:11.108]  Go read the bill.
[00:42:11.108 --> 00:42:16.174]  But I mean, we had a few weeks ago on about the bill, if you don't believe me, I won't go look it up.
[00:42:16.174 --> 00:42:19.177]  Judge Napolitano, former federal judge, he said it's worse than that, Alex.
[00:42:19.697 --> 00:42:20.897]  No one knows where you go.
[00:42:20.897 --> 00:42:22.458]  No one knows why you get arrested.
[00:42:22.458 --> 00:42:31.700]  For any reason, for, quote, intelligence purposes, a citizen can be grabbed, secretly stripped by the Pentagon and Justice Department of citizenship, and disappear into a black hole.
[00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:33.060]  I mean, that's Pol Pot.
[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:34.140]  That's Mao Zedong.
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:35.141]  That's Hitler.
[00:42:35.141 --> 00:42:35.981]  That's Stalin.
[00:42:35.981 --> 00:42:38.261]  That's as bad as it gets.
[00:42:38.261 --> 00:42:40.802]  And these people really mean business.
[00:42:40.802 --> 00:42:43.183]  They really are criminals.
[00:42:43.183 --> 00:42:46.663]  It is criminal to be in government and call for these things.
[00:42:46.663 --> 00:42:48.184]  Read the Declaration of Independence.
[00:42:48.184 --> 00:42:48.904]  Read the Bill of Rights.
[00:42:49.224 --> 00:42:50.685]  Read the Constitution.
[00:42:50.685 --> 00:42:53.287]  This is criminal!
[00:42:53.287 --> 00:43:02.574]  As private citizens they could call for tyranny and arrest of people for free speech, but you can't sit there in a power position.
[00:43:02.574 --> 00:43:09.059]  If you have a mayor saying we should be able to pass a city law and just arrest you and throw you in a dungeon, that's criminal.
[00:43:10.029 --> 00:43:13.473]  When you have police chiefs, you know, saying, we ought to get rid of the internet, it's bad.
[00:43:13.473 --> 00:43:14.174]  That's criminal.
[00:43:14.174 --> 00:43:29.311]  Folks, they're calling to come and take your property, your free speech, your website, and they're all starting to, you know, like a bunch of blackbirds in a tree, flap their wings and caw, you know, like on a fall night when the trees are full of the blackbirds.
[00:43:32.014 --> 00:43:33.034]  Yeah, the key aspect of this is that
[00:43:49.781 --> 00:43:55.685]  These statements by Sunstein were made before Obama even got elected.
[00:43:55.685 --> 00:44:04.871]  Just like his January 2008 white paper entitled Conspiracy Theories was written before Obama came into office.
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:07.901]  Sunstein was selected.
[00:44:07.901 --> 00:44:11.743]  He was selected because of these very views on free speech.
[00:44:11.743 --> 00:44:13.204]  And now he's trying to implement them.
[00:44:13.204 --> 00:44:14.825]  I mean, that's the big issue here.
[00:44:14.825 --> 00:44:16.146]  We know they said all this.
[00:44:16.146 --> 00:44:17.547]  Now they're trying it.
[00:44:17.547 --> 00:44:21.309]  Yeah, it's not just some nutcase professor somewhere.
[00:44:21.309 --> 00:44:24.210]  This is the head of information technology in the White House.
[00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:27.632]  And his minion is about to be the next Supreme Court justice.
[00:44:27.632 --> 00:44:32.495]  I mean, there's not going to be any position that's not a former Goldman Sachs person in this country.
[00:44:32.495 --> 00:44:33.575]  Right.
[00:44:33.575 --> 00:44:34.316]  And Sunstein
[00:44:35.174 --> 00:44:36.675]  We know what his agenda is.
[00:44:36.675 --> 00:44:45.622]  It's not to introduce, quote, fairness, or two sides of the debate, which is a complete, you know, crock within itself.
[00:44:45.622 --> 00:44:58.932]  We read, at length, his January 2008 white paper, which I printed off and, you know, scanned and went through it, and that's how we were able to get an insight into what he's all about.
[00:44:58.932 --> 00:45:04.697]  Because in that white paper, he calls for taxing and outright banning
[00:45:05.293 --> 00:45:07.074]  Quote, conspiracy theories.
[00:45:07.074 --> 00:45:17.601]  And then, when you read into what he defines as conspiracy theories, they are beliefs or views that are held by the majority of Americans.
[00:45:17.601 --> 00:45:29.869]  The view that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone in killing JFK, the view that it was a wider conspiracy, is one shared by, according to a 1998 CBS poll, 90% of American people believe that.
[00:45:34.688 --> 00:45:40.309]  And this is what he describes as an opinion that needs to be tacked or banned.
[00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:50.492]  He also said that the view that global warming is a deliberate fraud is also, similarly, something that the government needs to censor.
[00:45:50.492 --> 00:45:59.454]  When, again, the majority of Americans, the latest polls now show, believe that global warming either doesn't exist, or if it does, that it's natural.
[00:45:59.454 --> 00:46:00.574]  That's the majority view.
[00:46:01.604 --> 00:46:03.725]  So they're going directly after free speech.
[00:46:03.725 --> 00:46:05.526]  It has nothing to do with fairness.
[00:46:05.526 --> 00:46:08.607]  It has nothing to do with having two sides of the debate.
[00:46:08.607 --> 00:46:20.713]  Sunstein, like Kagan, is targeting the First Amendment and he wants to censor and have mandatory government propaganda on the internet as part of that effort to do so.
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:28.767]  And even if it was unpopular speech, that is the most protected speech under the First Amendment.
[00:46:28.767 --> 00:46:35.595]  But the fact that 99% in polls were against the banker bailout, he says you shouldn't be able to criticize the central banks.
[00:46:35.595 --> 00:46:42.383]  Behind the scenes, most of the Fed's energy is spent brainwashing police that anybody that wants to audit the Fed is a murdering terrorist.
[00:46:43.024 --> 00:46:45.226]  Yeah, and they're already doing it via these
[00:47:08.027 --> 00:47:21.858]  Mandatory internet filters in places like universities, cafes, major international transport hubs, where you can't even access political websites, never mind prisonplanet.com.
[00:47:21.858 --> 00:47:26.342]  You can't even get to mildly political liberal websites, for example.
[00:47:27.014 --> 00:47:30.775]  So, they're already, you know, targeting free speech in that way.
[00:47:30.775 --> 00:47:31.176]  That's right.
[00:47:31.176 --> 00:47:42.680]  This system of censorship has already been tested out in China, New Zealand's testing it out, Australia's testing it out, Italy's testing it out, England is trying to now start to test it out.
[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:45.661]  This is now beginning to actually happen.
[00:47:45.661 --> 00:47:51.183]  And it's all being directed towards licensing to use the internet.
[00:47:51.183 --> 00:47:53.984]  Microsoft executives have called for it.
[00:47:53.984 --> 00:47:55.685]  IBM executives have called for it.
[00:47:56.468 --> 00:48:01.010]  Even China rejected individual numbers for bloggers.
[00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:08.352]  They wanted to give bloggers ID cards, but it got shot down in China because it was too repressive.
[00:48:08.352 --> 00:48:14.634]  But this is exactly the system that is now being called for in Britain, in America, and in the West.
[00:48:14.634 --> 00:48:22.317]  So they want to give you a license to blog, basically, and a license to have an opinion, because they're scared that their
[00:48:22.816 --> 00:48:30.499]  You know, establishment information empire is being overturned by individuals and by political blogs, which it is.
[00:48:30.499 --> 00:48:33.280]  Now, let's talk about how they plan to implement it.
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:38.683]  We probably need a part two of your story or beef it up a bit because it's so important.
[00:48:38.683 --> 00:48:42.484]  They've told us how they're going to do it, and it isn't just Alex Jones saying this.
[00:48:42.484 --> 00:48:46.666]  It's Newsweek, it's Mother Jones, but Newsweek says it's a good idea.
[00:48:46.666 --> 00:48:49.167]  It's the New York Times saying it's a good idea.
[00:48:49.167 --> 00:48:50.548]  The Cybersecurity Act
[00:48:51.548 --> 00:48:51.768]  I think?
[00:49:11.167 --> 00:49:25.974]  Yeah, I mean there's got to be very few maybe a few small towns where the ISP has you know less than a hundred customers so almost all ISPs will then have to put government software and hardware in their chain and this
[00:49:26.614 --> 00:49:34.600]  Of course, it's exactly what happened with the Telecommunications Act of 96, making all cell phones being GPS tracking devices, audio tracking devices.
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:35.781]  That's now admitted.
[00:49:35.781 --> 00:49:38.343]  Tracking people in real time, even when the phone is off.
[00:49:38.343 --> 00:49:40.385]  By law, they're built to those specs.
[00:49:40.385 --> 00:49:41.365]  By law.
[00:49:41.365 --> 00:49:44.608]  Europe was also part of similar legislation.
[00:49:44.608 --> 00:49:46.949]  And it's the same thing with the EAS alert system.
[00:49:46.949 --> 00:49:51.013]  Previously, you had one station in every town and city or region.
[00:49:51.793 --> 00:50:08.963]  It was rural, where the radio stations, in an emergency, an emergency alert was put out by the biggest station in town, and by emergency FCC regulations, everyone had to tune to that emergency alert, if it was a real alert, not just a test.
[00:50:08.963 --> 00:50:20.470]  But in 96, they put in the EAS shortwave controlled, literally doomsday system, where every radio station, at the studio and at the tower, has a failsafe,
[00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:28.595]  The shortwave government system dials in and takes control of radio, TV, and cable.
[00:50:28.595 --> 00:50:31.477]  And so this is just an expansion over all communications.
[00:50:31.477 --> 00:50:38.682]  So they're going to come at it that way, and they're going to come at it with the other software taxes and regulations.
[00:50:38.682 --> 00:50:45.387]  But if they have trouble passing it, they've already told us there's going to be big cyber attacks, which they're hyping, which of course they will launch.
[00:50:46.107 --> 00:50:48.468]  Uh, then crippling some key system.
[00:50:48.468 --> 00:50:53.431]  Nuclear reactors should not be hooked up to the internet, and they're not hooked up, that's a lie.
[00:50:53.431 --> 00:50:57.253]  But power grids shouldn't be, and they're not, but they're saying they are.
[00:50:57.253 --> 00:51:03.216]  So they're gonna run a false flag on us.
[00:51:03.216 --> 00:51:04.437]  This is not a drill.
[00:51:04.437 --> 00:51:06.298]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:51:08.829 --> 00:51:16.057]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[00:51:16.057 --> 00:51:20.442]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.

[00:51:30.953 --> 00:51:32.574]  Under any circumstance.

[00:51:39.796 --> 00:51:40.497]  But listen up.

[00:51:53.742 --> 00:51:54.322]  Right now.
[00:52:01.693 --> 00:52:05.556]  You may be arrested and you're subject to other police action.
[00:52:05.556 --> 00:52:06.817]  Tyranny is here.
[00:52:06.817 --> 00:52:10.520]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:12.981]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:52:12.981 --> 00:52:18.846]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:52:18.846 --> 00:52:25.531]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:52:25.531 --> 00:52:31.015]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:52:31.488 --> 00:52:35.671]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:52:35.671 --> 00:52:39.954]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:52:39.954 --> 00:52:45.898]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:52:45.898 --> 00:52:49.460]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:51.421]  The Police State isn't coming.
[00:52:51.421 --> 00:52:52.542]  It's here.

[00:54:10.908 --> 00:54:13.290]  I want to underline what I'm about to say.
[00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:14.912]  I want to highlight it for everyone.
[00:54:14.912 --> 00:54:16.974]  Please listen to me very carefully.
[00:54:16.974 --> 00:54:19.396]  We've all got to work together on this.
[00:54:19.396 --> 00:54:22.479]  We've gone the last six years, seven years.
[00:54:23.615 --> 00:54:27.938]  I guess eight years, time just flies, since I discovered the Internet2 plan.
[00:54:27.938 --> 00:54:33.481]  And they had public symposiums in London, in Tokyo, in Austin, Texas, every year.
[00:54:33.481 --> 00:54:38.184]  And it was the big universities, the governments meeting, the UN.
[00:54:38.184 --> 00:54:42.406]  And they said, in fact they would call it each year, the Internet is dead.
[00:54:42.406 --> 00:54:49.010]  And if you Google that headline, you can find some of the Internet2 articles and minutes of their meetings.
[00:54:49.010 --> 00:54:50.731]  These are public.
[00:54:50.731 --> 00:54:52.953]  I mean, anybody can, you know, buy a ticket to it and go.
[00:54:55.021 --> 00:54:58.366]  And they openly laid out their plan to take over the Internet.
[00:54:58.366 --> 00:55:01.850]  Now, we told you how they would do it, and people said, oh, it'll never happen.
[00:55:01.850 --> 00:55:02.751]  Shut up, Alex.
[00:55:02.751 --> 00:55:04.433]  I'm not going to read your article.
[00:55:04.433 --> 00:55:06.576]  I'm not going to read the minutes of Internet2 meetings.
[00:55:06.576 --> 00:55:11.082]  And Paul Watson and Steve Watson wrote articles about it over and over and over again.
[00:55:12.103 --> 00:55:15.846]  Now we're here, and they're openly announcing in the news they want to do it.
[00:55:15.846 --> 00:55:19.048]  They're putting people into the Supreme Court who openly are calling for it.
[00:55:19.048 --> 00:55:21.049]  They've got regulations ours in place.
[00:55:21.049 --> 00:55:22.771]  Europe is passing these laws.
[00:55:22.771 --> 00:55:24.592]  This is happening, okay?
[00:55:24.592 --> 00:55:25.813]  This is outrageous.
[00:55:25.813 --> 00:55:26.954]  It's unpopular.
[00:55:26.954 --> 00:55:32.157]  They've done national polls where over 90% of Americans are against Internet censorship.
[00:55:32.157 --> 00:55:39.282]  They've done national polls where upwards of 70% of Americans trust the Internet and alternative news more than mainstream news, and that number's growing.
[00:55:39.282 --> 00:55:40.403]  They're losing all credibility.
[00:55:40.663 --> 00:55:43.630]  They are going to try to do this, okay?
[00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:47.037]  This is really happening, and we can't live in denial anymore.
[00:55:47.037 --> 00:55:48.941]  So I'm begging all of the listeners...
[00:55:49.881 --> 00:55:56.884]  To get these articles that Paul Watson has written on this subject and to send them out to everyone you know.
[00:55:56.884 --> 00:55:57.204]  Okay?
[00:55:57.204 --> 00:55:58.925]  This is really happening.
[00:55:58.925 --> 00:56:00.466]  I know it's incredible.
[00:56:00.466 --> 00:56:01.406]  Alright?
[00:56:01.406 --> 00:56:04.388]  I mean, it's one thing to see him talking about it eight years ago.
[00:56:04.388 --> 00:56:05.568]  It's another thing to see him doing it.
[00:56:05.568 --> 00:56:07.949]  But they're now moving to do it.
[00:56:07.949 --> 00:56:12.271]  Paul Watson in closing in the last few minutes of this hour.
[00:56:12.271 --> 00:56:15.613]  I mean, I think that's the number one message is to point out this is really happening.
[00:56:17.113 --> 00:56:17.913]  Yeah, it's going on.
[00:56:17.913 --> 00:56:29.576]  I mean, Australia's already introduced their blacklist of censored websites, which included things like anti-abortion websites, different political websites.
[00:56:29.576 --> 00:56:40.078]  And the thing, the problem with creating blacklists is not just that free speech is censored, it's that it completely slows the internet down as a whole.
[00:56:40.078 --> 00:56:43.879]  If you go to China and you try and get onto websites in China,
[00:56:44.602 --> 00:56:53.398]  Everything, every URL you type in has to be redirected to a central government blacklist server before you're allowed to visit the website.
[00:56:53.985 --> 00:56:58.268]  Now, government websites, when they get high traffic, routinely crash.
[00:56:58.268 --> 00:57:08.513]  So if every website that people visit first has to be routed through a government blacklist, then it's going to create infrastructure and server problems for the internet as a whole.
[00:57:08.513 --> 00:57:19.680]  In fact, that's one of the main criticisms of the Australian-slash-Chinese model by companies, is that this is going to really screw up connectability and crash the web on a routine basis.
[00:57:20.965 --> 00:57:26.710]  Exactly, so that's going to affect businesses, it's going to affect everyone, not just political websites.
[00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:30.454]  So it's going to be bad for the economy as well as killing free speech on the internet.
[00:57:32.116 --> 00:57:34.258]  And I always hear yuppies.
[00:57:34.258 --> 00:57:39.001]  I was talking to my neighbor the other day, and I said, you know, the stock market's dropped by a thousand points.
[00:57:39.001 --> 00:57:40.583]  And he said, well, I'm not in the stock market.
[00:57:40.583 --> 00:57:44.546]  And I said, well, neither am I. But it's connected to the entire economy.
[00:57:44.546 --> 00:57:46.047]  And I'm not mad at him.
[00:57:46.047 --> 00:57:49.509]  It's just that we're automatically programmed to say, I don't care.
[00:57:49.509 --> 00:57:51.071]  I don't have a political website.
[00:57:51.071 --> 00:57:53.753]  Folks, do you know why they want to shut down debate?
[00:57:53.753 --> 00:58:00.278]  They don't want the American people to have a voice so they can rob your pension funds, so they can have warrantless blood draws at checkpoints.
[00:58:00.598 --> 00:58:01.959]  By the way, a judge has struck that down.
[00:58:01.959 --> 00:58:03.161]  We're going to cover that later.
[00:58:03.161 --> 00:58:09.387]  I mean, don't people know what comes along with street cameras and checkpoints and spies and censorship?
[00:58:09.387 --> 00:58:11.529]  It's horrible!
[00:58:11.529 --> 00:58:22.661]  Well, the ironic thing about Sunstein's white paper is that he says a large number of conspiracy theories in society indicate that we live in a repressive system.
[00:58:23.587 --> 00:58:25.088]  Which is exactly the case!
[00:58:25.088 --> 00:58:28.691]  The more repressive the system gets, the more people are going to speak out.
[00:58:28.691 --> 00:58:35.275]  So what they define as conspiracy theories is merely an opposing viewpoint to establishment propaganda.
[00:58:35.275 --> 00:58:38.617]  But they want to force us all to listen to establishment propaganda.
[00:58:38.617 --> 00:58:39.058]  They do!
[00:58:39.058 --> 00:58:39.698]  Good job!

[00:59:55.796 --> 00:59:58.559]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.273 --> 01:00:10.095]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.095 --> 01:00:11.696]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.696 --> 01:00:13.236]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.236 --> 01:00:17.418]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.418 --> 01:00:22.640]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:25.922]  Alright folks, here's what I want to do in this second hour.
[01:00:25.922 --> 01:00:32.504]  We're going to open the phones up for first-time callers on two subjects.
[01:00:32.504 --> 01:00:33.245]  Two subjects.
[01:00:34.332 --> 01:00:41.774]  Sometimes we have wide open phones, sometimes we have first-time callers, sometimes we say just police officers can call in, or military, depending on the subject.
[01:00:41.774 --> 01:00:51.976]  But today, in this hour, we'll have wide open phones in the third and fourth hour with Max Keiser joining us again, and then Gary Franchi and a bunch of other key news coming up on a host of issues.
[01:00:51.976 --> 01:00:57.777]  But in this hour, I want to open the phones up for first-time callers on two subjects.
[01:00:59.158 --> 01:01:04.480]  What's happening in the markets and the open announcement of world government run by the private banks.
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:07.421]  The EU on the verge of total collapse.
[01:01:07.421 --> 01:01:11.603]  Your take, your view on that, where you see this going.
[01:01:11.603 --> 01:01:18.286]  And secondarily, but just as important, Obama czar wants mandatory government propaganda on political websites.
[01:01:20.049 --> 01:01:22.051]  That's the PrisonPlanet.com headline.
[01:01:22.051 --> 01:01:23.192]  Here's the Hill headline.
[01:01:23.192 --> 01:01:25.455]  New GOP argument against Kagan.
[01:01:25.455 --> 01:01:27.337]  She could ban books.
[01:01:27.337 --> 01:01:37.027]  Well, we've got all our quotes, and Watson's written a bunch of articles, so has Stewartson, his brother, in the last week and a half on this, but he's doing a master article that'll be out in the next hour at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:38.308]  It'll be posted at InfoWars.com.
[01:01:39.429 --> 01:01:48.593]  That goes over all of it, with links to statements by her on her own publications, like the University of Chicago Law Review.
[01:01:48.593 --> 01:01:56.976]  These are white papers written by her, because the controlled fake left media keeps saying, it's not true, she doesn't want your guns, promise.
[01:01:56.976 --> 01:01:58.777]  It's a lie.
[01:01:58.777 --> 01:01:59.597]  Promise.
[01:01:59.597 --> 01:02:01.938]  Promise the insurance companies didn't write the health bill.
[01:02:02.338 --> 01:02:08.384]  Promise, trust us, liars!
[01:02:08.384 --> 01:02:12.809]  And Cass Sunstein running around saying, we're gonna get your guns, we're gonna get your free speech.
[01:02:12.809 --> 01:02:18.255]  We have got to punch through the mainstream media and just point out they're spinning and lying as usual.
[01:02:19.793 --> 01:02:25.319]  This is so vital, so I want to take your calls on that subject and what's happening with the economy.
[01:02:25.319 --> 01:02:25.559]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:02:25.559 --> 01:02:29.503]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us on this worldwide broadcast today.
[01:02:41.916 --> 01:03:09.560]  You've also got statements you want to make about the attack on free speech or short statements about what's happening with the banking system I want to start reading more of these on air twitter.com forward slash real Alex Jones and We'll go over some of those in this hour as well 1-800-259-9231 if you just joined us headline new GOP argument against Kagan she could ban books the hill new argument
[01:03:10.674 --> 01:03:12.439]  It's not an argument.
[01:03:12.439 --> 01:03:15.106]  She has called for a tax on free speech.
[01:03:18.451 --> 01:03:26.279]  And that's what she said, and that's what Cass Sunstein has said, her pimp daddy, her sugar daddy, politically.
[01:03:26.279 --> 01:03:29.702]  And she's another former Goldman Sachs minion, a Goldman Sachs lawyer.
[01:03:29.702 --> 01:03:34.607]  I mean, can we have... They're putting in Goldman Sachs people as major mayors in major cities.
[01:03:34.607 --> 01:03:41.233]  I mean, they've got every regulatory position, not just in the U.S., but in most other nations, and every nation they run, they're robbing right now.
[01:03:42.114 --> 01:03:44.196]  It's admitted they're robbing the EU.
[01:03:44.196 --> 01:03:47.480]  They built the EU as a tool to scam people.
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:53.906]  To get you right where they want you and do what they've done in third world countries.
[01:03:53.906 --> 01:03:55.148]  How do we fight these people?
[01:03:55.148 --> 01:04:00.873]  How do we first get the word out of what they're doing and then expose the fact that this is tyranny with a capital T?
[01:04:02.810 --> 01:04:04.691]  But what else do we do?
[01:04:04.691 --> 01:04:05.432]  We sue them.
[01:04:05.432 --> 01:04:06.233]  We expose them.
[01:04:06.233 --> 01:04:07.414]  We don't give in to them.
[01:04:07.414 --> 01:04:10.176]  We don't go along with them.
[01:04:10.176 --> 01:04:14.339]  We say no to this system.
[01:04:14.339 --> 01:04:17.221]  We resist the globalists at every front.
[01:04:17.221 --> 01:04:19.043]  We call them out for who they are.
[01:04:19.043 --> 01:04:21.064]  We start becoming more bold.
[01:04:21.064 --> 01:04:22.145]  Because we don't have a lot of time.
[01:04:22.145 --> 01:04:23.766]  They're going to try to shut the web down soon.
[01:04:23.766 --> 01:04:25.288]  They're going to launch new wars soon.
[01:04:25.288 --> 01:04:26.769]  They're going to stage terror attacks soon.
[01:04:26.769 --> 01:04:30.532]  I don't know in what order, but you better believe your bottom dollar should be betted on that fact.
[01:04:31.405 --> 01:04:32.605]  Okay?
[01:04:32.605 --> 01:04:34.906]  And because they can't do anything else.
[01:04:34.906 --> 01:04:36.227]  Their credibility is gone.
[01:04:36.227 --> 01:04:37.327]  It's not collapsing.
[01:04:37.327 --> 01:04:38.228]  It's gone.
[01:04:38.228 --> 01:04:44.710]  It's down the toilet, down the sewer line, and it's already gone through the major sewage pipes and is in the sewage treatment facility.
[01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:45.831]  It's gone.
[01:04:45.831 --> 01:04:46.391]  Okay?
[01:04:46.391 --> 01:04:47.231]  It's gone.
[01:04:47.231 --> 01:04:48.472]  It ain't coming back.
[01:04:48.472 --> 01:04:56.094]  All they can do is try to bring in corruption and oppression and shut us up because we're going into real, bonafide despotism.
[01:04:56.094 --> 01:04:57.455]  And this is the proof of it.
[01:04:57.455 --> 01:05:00.036]  They are outrageously, out in the open, peddling this.
[01:05:00.436 --> 01:05:08.443]  In March, Alex Jones announced that eFoods Direct was putting together a high-volume, pre-production order of the new Quick Fix meals.
[01:05:08.443 --> 01:05:15.790]  By waiting for production and shipping of their orders, families were able to receive one free item for every three that they bought.
[01:05:15.790 --> 01:05:22.776]  Since the final shutdown of this buy three, get one free program, we've had a lot of folks calling, disappointed that they missed the order deadline.
[01:05:22.776 --> 01:05:23.617]  Listen carefully.
[01:05:23.997 --> 01:05:33.699]  Starting immediately, eFoodsDirect.com will take pre-production orders for a buy three get one free program for one week ending May 14th at midnight.
[01:05:33.699 --> 01:05:37.940]  You will receive one free item for every three that you order of the selected products.
[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:40.941]  These orders will begin shipping the first week of June.
[01:05:40.941 --> 01:05:45.142]  To order on the web, eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex or call 800-409-5633.
[01:05:45.142 --> 01:05:46.062]  That's eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex

[01:05:56.725 --> 01:05:57.345]  800-409-5633.
[01:05:57.345 --> 01:06:01.527]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:06:01.527 --> 01:06:07.109]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:06:07.109 --> 01:06:12.150]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:17.172]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:06:17.712 --> 01:06:22.936]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:06:22.936 --> 01:06:25.257]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:06:25.257 --> 01:06:30.060]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:31.161]  And here's the best part.
[01:06:31.161 --> 01:06:34.243]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:06:34.243 --> 01:06:37.866]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:06:37.866 --> 01:06:41.048]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:06:41.048 --> 01:06:43.269]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[01:06:47.832 --> 01:06:50.793]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:06:50.793 --> 01:06:56.894]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:06:56.894 --> 01:07:00.035]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:07:00.035 --> 01:07:01.675]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:07:01.675 --> 01:07:05.056]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.

[01:07:21.339 --> 01:07:24.000]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:30.522]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.

[01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:02.463]  Thank you.
[01:08:02.463 --> 01:08:08.047]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.791 --> 01:08:13.733]  Coming up later in the hour, I'm going to get into the latest developments.
[01:08:13.733 --> 01:08:15.253]  It's now over 40 dead.
[01:08:15.253 --> 01:08:18.615]  It was 20 dead yesterday and one day in Thailand.
[01:08:18.615 --> 01:08:26.119]  Watching the videos and seeing the photographs of valiant Thais fighting with children's slingshots.
[01:08:26.119 --> 01:08:30.742]  Not wrist rockets that are actually high-powered weapons shooting ball bearings.
[01:08:30.742 --> 01:08:33.443]  No, fighting with the type of slingshot you buy at 7-Eleven.
[01:08:35.225 --> 01:08:43.934]  Up against thousands of heavily armed troops with m16s and grenade launchers Here's the headlines Thailand toughens stance against
[01:08:46.004 --> 01:08:47.145]  Huge protest.
[01:08:47.145 --> 01:08:47.966]  There's another one.
[01:08:47.966 --> 01:08:52.189]  Clashes continue in Bangkok as protesters defy deadline.
[01:08:52.189 --> 01:08:55.372]  The troops have told them for four days, we're coming in to machine gun you.
[01:08:55.372 --> 01:08:58.475]  They've started machine gunning and killing people.
[01:08:58.475 --> 01:09:03.119]  And men, women and children are standing and fighting like the Alamo.
[01:09:03.119 --> 01:09:04.560]  And the government is corrupt.
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:10.826]  It is robbing them for big central banks, taking their pension funds, raising taxes.
[01:09:10.826 --> 01:09:12.868]  And our government should be supporting them.
[01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:17.802]  They should be supporting the red shirts and what they're doing.
[01:09:17.802 --> 01:09:20.144]  And I see we have a call from Choke in Thailand.
[01:09:20.144 --> 01:09:27.749]  I should also add, you can call in about Cass Sunstein wanting to, quote, have mandatory government propaganda on political websites.
[01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:31.732]  The Hill newspaper reporting that, yeah, Kagan could ban books.
[01:09:31.732 --> 01:09:35.575]  I mean, that's what she's written and said, what's happening with the economy.
[01:09:35.575 --> 01:09:37.736]  But also calls from Thailand, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:09:37.736 --> 01:09:38.997]  We're going to go to Choke.
[01:09:42.219 --> 01:09:45.581]  Norman, Grady, John, Jim, and others here in a moment.
[01:09:45.581 --> 01:09:50.383]  Before I do that, three new films we're offering in the last month.
[01:09:50.383 --> 01:10:09.591]  First off, Invisible Empire, New World Order Defined, The Globalists in Their Own Words, over 200 clips of world leaders calling for world government, global government, New World Order, how they ship in the narcotics, how they control the central banks, an incredible film, a year and a half in the making, great to wake people up to the overall New World Order system and discredit these crooks.
[01:10:10.697 --> 01:10:11.257]  We're good to go.
[01:10:41.858 --> 01:10:48.623]  And that's also covered in a new film by Gary Franchi and William Lewis, Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:10:48.623 --> 01:10:51.846]  Gary Franchi will be joining us in the last hour today, featuring R.J.
[01:10:51.846 --> 01:11:01.074]  Harris, Michael Bagnerik, Alex Jones, Edwin Vieira, Richard Mack, Charles Key, Cynthia Davis, and many, many others.
[01:11:01.074 --> 01:11:02.475]  And here's the back cover.
[01:11:02.475 --> 01:11:05.957]  It says, Self-government is not a spectator sport, Dr. Edwin Vieira.
[01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:09.222]  Another headline by Steven Shute.
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:47.724]  Of the Commerce Clause, the suppressed and ignored states' rights issue, defined sovereignty, the proper role of government, a constitutional militia, and much more.
[01:11:47.724 --> 01:11:54.987]  Don't Tread on Me offers sound solutions to take back rights stolen from our out-of-control, despotic federal government.
[01:11:54.987 --> 01:12:01.109]  It is such an important film for people that don't know the difference between a republic and a democracy.
[01:12:01.109 --> 01:12:03.470]  What type of government do we have, Benjamin Franklin?
[01:12:04.617 --> 01:12:07.058]  A republic if you can keep it.
[01:12:07.058 --> 01:12:08.599]  What did George Washington say?
[01:12:08.599 --> 01:12:13.422]  If we can keep this government in place for 20 years, it may go on forever.
[01:12:13.422 --> 01:12:19.625]  When they offered him kingship and he said no and stepped down and left back to his farm.
[01:12:19.625 --> 01:12:21.606]  This film is so important.
[01:12:21.606 --> 01:12:25.248]  They're all available at Infowars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:12:25.248 --> 01:12:25.948]  Choke in Thailand!
[01:12:25.948 --> 01:12:27.049]  What's on your mind today?
[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:36.220]  Oh, I'm your fan from Thailand.
[01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:38.621]  I listen to your program almost every day.
[01:12:38.621 --> 01:12:44.982]  Until my wife is getting jealous, I listen to you more than I listen to her.
[01:12:44.982 --> 01:12:46.883]  Well, God bless you, sir.
[01:12:46.883 --> 01:12:49.763]  I know the phones are open for what's happening with the banks and the attacks.
[01:12:49.763 --> 01:12:51.224]  Well, God bless you, too.
[01:12:51.224 --> 01:12:54.344]  I pray for you that God will sustain you and protect you.
[01:12:54.344 --> 01:12:56.385]  You are very courageous.
[01:12:56.385 --> 01:12:57.685]  Continue your good work.
[01:12:57.685 --> 01:12:59.945]  Now, I just have one to report.
[01:12:59.945 --> 01:13:01.366]  I'm calling live from Thailand.
[01:13:02.945 --> 01:13:11.590]  Uh, and what you read just now, about Thailand, uh, is from the mainstream media, and it is not true.
[01:13:11.590 --> 01:13:12.190]  Hello?
[01:13:12.190 --> 01:13:12.890]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:13:12.890 --> 01:13:27.137]  You know, you had an article out two days ago, which it says, uh, it's from your organization, Infoneware.com, Thai military slaughter, red shirts, of red shirts intensifies.
[01:13:27.137 --> 01:13:27.818]  Yes.
[01:13:27.818 --> 01:13:30.039]  I think the truth is the opposite.
[01:13:31.454 --> 01:13:35.055]  If you believe me or not, I... No, I mean, let me just say this.
[01:13:35.055 --> 01:13:41.376]  When I see men, women, and children fighting with slingshots, I tend to side with them.
[01:13:41.376 --> 01:13:42.237]  But you're there.
[01:13:42.237 --> 01:13:43.257]  You know more than I do.
[01:13:43.257 --> 01:13:48.818]  I mean, I've seen a lot of corruption out of the Thai government in the last few years, but I'm not an expert.
[01:13:48.818 --> 01:13:49.458]  Far from it.
[01:13:49.458 --> 01:13:50.879]  So, give us your view, sir.
[01:13:50.879 --> 01:13:52.559]  We want to hear it, Choke.
[01:13:52.559 --> 01:13:53.139]  Okay.
[01:13:53.139 --> 01:13:59.441]  You are far away, and the news from Thailand is controlled by the New World Order.
[01:14:00.948 --> 01:14:05.952]  And the mainstream media, as you know, is controlled by the New World Order.
[01:14:05.952 --> 01:14:10.095]  So just now you read about the news about Thailand.
[01:14:10.095 --> 01:14:12.596]  Lots of it are not true.
[01:14:12.596 --> 01:14:14.678]  And your
[01:14:15.795 --> 01:14:20.559]  No, no, sir, first let me just be clear.
[01:14:20.559 --> 01:14:23.921]  We link to mainstream news, alternative news, legislation.
[01:14:23.921 --> 01:14:27.804]  A lot of times I link to news, and people say, why are you linking to CNN?
[01:14:27.804 --> 01:14:29.145]  Well, we want to show you what they're saying.
[01:14:29.145 --> 01:14:30.706]  It doesn't mean I 100% agree with it.
[01:14:30.706 --> 01:14:33.908]  So correct me, choke, it won't hurt my feelings.
[01:14:33.908 --> 01:14:37.611]  As a Thailand citizen, tell us how close to Bangkok you are.
[01:14:37.611 --> 01:14:38.952]  Give us your view of what's really happening.
[01:14:39.554 --> 01:14:42.777]  Okay, I'm a real Thai calling from Thailand Live now.
[01:14:42.777 --> 01:14:48.221]  The true story is opposite what the mainstream media tells you.
[01:14:48.221 --> 01:14:53.805]  And you say they use slingshots, the red shirt protesters use slingshots.
[01:14:53.805 --> 01:15:04.914]  Yes, they have slingshots, but they also have M16 guns, weapons, war weapons, and grenade launchers, you know, M79.
[01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:13.594]  The red shirt protesters... Actually, this is funny.
[01:15:13.594 --> 01:15:16.756]  Usually, the government side is on the wrong.
[01:15:16.756 --> 01:15:22.080]  But this time, the Thai government is the legitimate government.
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:25.783]  They are elected democratically.
[01:15:25.783 --> 01:15:29.346]  The present prime minister, Apichit, is a good man.
[01:15:29.346 --> 01:15:37.132]  But the ex-red shirt ex-prime minister, called Mr. Thaksin Chinawat,
[01:15:37.901 --> 01:15:41.844]  Who is in exile and has been a convicted criminal.
[01:15:41.844 --> 01:15:50.712]  He went on exile, imposed himself on exile by himself and he wanted to regain power.
[01:15:50.712 --> 01:15:56.637]  He's using the red shirt protesters to cause violence, riots and to pressure the
[01:15:57.461 --> 01:15:59.241]  Good Thai government.
[01:15:59.241 --> 01:16:07.423]  Well, yes, I'm aware of some of that back story, but normally, even if somebody tried to stir people up, they wouldn't get stirred up if they weren't already angry.
[01:16:07.423 --> 01:16:12.064]  And I remember reading months ago about the Thais shutting down the airports.
[01:16:12.064 --> 01:16:13.604]  Why are the people so upset?
[01:16:13.604 --> 01:16:17.865]  The airport group is a different group.
[01:16:17.865 --> 01:16:20.685]  They are the... Exactly!
[01:16:20.685 --> 01:16:22.745]  So there's a lot of people mad is what I'm saying.
[01:16:22.745 --> 01:16:25.246]  Why are the people in Thailand so upset?
[01:16:27.037 --> 01:16:32.821]  Okay, they, um, most of them are mercenaries that you see on the pictures, red shirt pictures, mercenaries.
[01:16:32.821 --> 01:16:33.682]  They're paid.
[01:16:33.682 --> 01:16:35.824]  And some are communists.
[01:16:35.824 --> 01:16:36.964]  Okay?
[01:16:36.964 --> 01:16:45.030]  Lots of socialists and lots of, uh, of the scum of the Thai society.
[01:16:45.030 --> 01:16:46.792]  I'm 65 years old.
[01:16:46.792 --> 01:16:49.373]  I'm a retired physician.
[01:16:49.373 --> 01:16:50.835]  I'm not talking nonsense to you.
[01:16:50.835 --> 01:16:52.676]  If you believe me, it's up to you.
[01:16:52.676 --> 01:16:55.398]  But I think your, uh, these
[01:16:55.888 --> 01:16:59.691]  Red Shirt protesters are violent people.
[01:16:59.691 --> 01:17:01.873]  They have caused a lot of violence.
[01:17:01.873 --> 01:17:13.163]  And you read that from the article, which I just said, you put out two days ago, the Thai military slaughter of Red Shirt intensifies.
[01:17:13.163 --> 01:17:16.025]  I think the title should be changed.
[01:17:16.025 --> 01:17:19.388]  Red Shirt, changing to this title, okay, the title.
[01:17:19.388 --> 01:17:24.092]  Red Shirt Terrorist Slaughtered Innocent Thai Soldiers.
[01:17:25.424 --> 01:17:27.764]  Well, sir, sir, you're on air now.
[01:17:27.764 --> 01:17:28.965]  We didn't screen your call.
[01:17:28.965 --> 01:17:37.707]  And I do know the globalists do go in and finance groups to destabilize countries to then drive down their markets so offshore banks can come in and take over.
[01:17:37.707 --> 01:17:40.207]  We have the IMF documents about that.
[01:17:40.207 --> 01:17:44.248]  I just know that you've had a lot of groups protesting, a lot of anger in Thailand.
[01:17:44.248 --> 01:17:47.368]  And so I want you to enlighten me.
[01:17:47.368 --> 01:17:49.649]  I haven't talked a lot about this because I've been trying to read.
[01:17:50.249 --> 01:18:18.924]  and uh... figure out what's going on and i think there's some truth on both sides but i i hear you say you're an intelligent retired physician i certainly can't speak thai you can speak english and so don't feel bad calling in and and and trying to correct me uh... i mean i want the truth that's why the phones are open uh... and perhaps uh... tomorrow we can open the phones up for an hour or two just for thai callers uh... and and get a overall view a diverse view from random callers uh... from thailand and we have
[01:18:19.804 --> 01:18:19.904]  Yes.
[01:18:19.904 --> 01:18:21.565]  Read what Insanity says in the reply forum.
[01:18:21.565 --> 01:18:21.966]  Insanity.
[01:18:21.966 --> 01:18:23.067]  I back him up.
[01:18:23.067 --> 01:18:23.527]  He's not a Thai.
[01:18:23.527 --> 01:18:23.987]  He's a foreigner.
[01:18:23.987 --> 01:18:24.528]  But on your
[01:18:49.404 --> 01:18:55.708]  Uh, May 15th article, Thai military slaughter of Red Shirts intensifies.
[01:18:55.708 --> 01:18:59.030]  Insanity has made good comments.
[01:18:59.030 --> 01:19:00.151]  He's telling the truth.
[01:19:00.151 --> 01:19:01.071]  He's a foreigner.
[01:19:01.071 --> 01:19:02.932]  I'm a Thai and I back him up.
[01:19:02.932 --> 01:19:03.793]  Every word he says.
[01:19:05.219 --> 01:19:10.003]  Well, we know our government's trying to get the illegal aliens to revolt here in the United States.
[01:19:10.003 --> 01:19:13.887]  And certainly if they revolt, the UN is going to be saying they're the good guys.
[01:19:13.887 --> 01:19:16.049]  Anybody that tries to stop them is the bad guys.
[01:19:16.049 --> 01:19:18.151]  And so I can see the perspective.
[01:19:18.151 --> 01:19:21.534]  And again, this won't be the first time I've been wrong.
[01:19:21.534 --> 01:19:28.380]  For about three hours, when the NATO-backed forces attacked South Ossetia and Russia,
[01:19:29.842 --> 01:19:33.505]  I mean, CNN lied so bald-faced and said that Russia had attacked.
[01:19:33.505 --> 01:19:43.616]  I went on air and said that until I got the facts, and then it was proven that it was that type of event, and then it was really NATO that had done it via the Georgian government.
[01:19:43.616 --> 01:19:50.062]  It's just that when we put a headline up about the military killing the Red Shirts, that did intensify, so that's true.
[01:19:51.023 --> 01:20:00.572]  You know just from the images, and I've seen video of the red shirts fighting I didn't see any m16s, but the media does manipulate So that's very important show write an article for us

[01:22:01.559 --> 01:22:02.580]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:08.105]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[01:22:08.105 --> 01:22:08.665]  I get it.
[01:22:08.665 --> 01:22:18.273]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:22:18.273 --> 01:22:19.694]  That's not what's happening.
[01:22:19.694 --> 01:22:24.058]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation.
[01:22:24.278 --> 01:22:26.119]  Or that the dollar wouldn't lose value.
[01:22:26.119 --> 01:22:28.161]  Or that your retirement would be secure.
[01:22:28.161 --> 01:22:31.543]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:22:31.543 --> 01:22:35.826]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:22:35.826 --> 01:22:37.407]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:22:37.407 --> 01:22:41.370]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[01:22:41.370 --> 01:22:45.192]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:22:45.192 --> 01:22:46.093]  You should too.
[01:22:46.093 --> 01:22:47.254]  Find out what they know.
[01:22:47.254 --> 01:22:50.496]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.

[01:22:50.856 --> 01:22:50.956]  800-686-2237.
[01:22:50.956 --> 01:22:51.136]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:01.336 --> 01:23:03.057]  Oh, my sinuses!
[01:23:03.057 --> 01:23:04.998]  They feel like they'll explode!
[01:23:04.998 --> 01:23:05.838]  Sinus pressure.
[01:23:05.838 --> 01:23:07.599]  Sinus headaches that keep you up at night.
[01:23:07.599 --> 01:23:08.859]  You've struggled for years.
[01:23:08.859 --> 01:23:14.702]  You've tried everything to get relief, but your sinus distress just keeps coming back and robbing you of the healthy life you deserve.
[01:23:14.702 --> 01:23:15.462]  Sound familiar?

[01:23:55.574 --> 01:23:55.895]  It works!
[01:24:03.988 --> 01:24:08.069]  In the last 15 minutes of the show, we're going to have Webster Tarpley pop in.
[01:24:08.069 --> 01:24:10.010]  He's doing research on Thailand right now.
[01:24:10.010 --> 01:24:13.391]  He says it appears to be outside Western manipulation.
[01:24:13.391 --> 01:24:15.092]  We'll get his view on that.
[01:24:15.092 --> 01:24:20.233]  But all I know is people fighting with slingshots, those aren't mercenaries.
[01:24:20.233 --> 01:24:21.474]  There's probably two sides to this.
[01:24:21.474 --> 01:24:22.894]  We're going to ferret it out.
[01:24:22.894 --> 01:24:25.135]  Norman in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:24:25.135 --> 01:24:25.555]  Go ahead.
[01:24:25.555 --> 01:24:27.976]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[01:24:27.976 --> 01:24:28.676]  Good sir, welcome.
[01:24:30.151 --> 01:24:32.733]  Well, I'd like to make a couple points.
[01:24:32.733 --> 01:24:52.331]  I heard about the Top 25 Site idea the first time on your show just now, and it immediately struck me that if the government puts up a Top 25 Sites pop-up or banner on top of any website, then those 25 sites will eventually become the permanent 25 sites, and all websites will have them on there.
[01:24:52.331 --> 01:24:54.433]  No, it'll create a monopoly, absolutely.
[01:24:54.433 --> 01:24:56.455]  It will immediately give them all the power.
[01:24:57.737 --> 01:25:02.120]  I know, it's absolutely despicable.
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:17.529]  The previous idea, the other alternative idea, according to them, is to give opposing viewpoints, and the obvious limit of that is going to be two sides of an issue, or two sides, political sides, which the government controls both of them.
[01:25:17.529 --> 01:25:21.532]  Like, they're going to look at a New World Order website, they're not going to say,
[01:25:22.371 --> 01:25:24.858]  There is no new world order on the opposing viewpoint.
[01:25:24.858 --> 01:25:29.513]  They're just going to disregard it because it doesn't follow within their bureaucratic media outlines.
[01:25:31.043 --> 01:25:38.047]  Well, of course they're going to go further than what they're announcing, but what they're announcing is just devastatingly off the chart.
[01:25:38.047 --> 01:25:46.713]  I mean, it's absolutely unconstitutional, absolutely anti-freedom, and they can't defeat us in an open market of ideas.
[01:25:46.713 --> 01:25:53.437]  Every day the alternative media gains leaps and bounds, and the mainstream media is imploding.
[01:25:53.837 --> 01:25:55.297]  I know, it's absolutely despicable.
[01:25:55.297 --> 01:25:56.718]  I'd like to make one more point.
[01:25:56.718 --> 01:26:00.098]  I've been calling, you know, I've called maybe 20 times to your show trying to get on.
[01:26:00.098 --> 01:26:01.778]  I'd really like to make this point.
[01:26:01.778 --> 01:26:03.459]  I read a book called
[01:26:23.962 --> 01:26:25.544]  And this is a sensitive subject.
[01:26:25.544 --> 01:26:33.091]  Circumcision, the hidden trauma, how an American cultural practice affects infants and ultimately us all.
[01:26:33.091 --> 01:26:35.554]  It's by Ronald Goldman.
[01:26:35.554 --> 01:26:47.706]  Basically in the book, he correlates positively divorce rates in America, rape rates, mother-son relationship problems, emotional trauma, prison population, etc., positively the circumcision in America.
[01:26:48.445 --> 01:26:53.408]  I never ever hear anything in the news or in the alternative news about circumcision in America.
[01:26:53.408 --> 01:27:11.179]  Well, many people do see it as a form of sexual mutilation, and it's something that most Protestants do, of course, picking it up from Jewish religious law, and that's not really an issue I've gotten into a lot, but I appreciate your call, Norman.
[01:27:11.179 --> 01:27:12.840]  Let's talk to Grady in Alaska.
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:13.440]  You're on the air.
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:15.842]  How are you doing?
[01:27:15.842 --> 01:27:16.142]  Good, sir.
[01:27:17.063 --> 01:27:25.749]  Oh, and I just want you to know that I support your show, and I'm one of those thousands of people that have decided to turn to alternative media.
[01:27:25.749 --> 01:27:31.553]  Because I've come to be disillusioned with the mainstream news, because it's just too much.
[01:27:31.553 --> 01:27:39.578]  Either it's one-sided on how they report certain issues, or they... Or they don't cover it, or they don't cover it, or it's fluff.
[01:27:39.578 --> 01:27:41.299]  Yeah, that's what I was about to say to you.
[01:27:41.299 --> 01:27:45.622]  But anyway, Alex, the main issues I want to talk to you about was about the Supreme Court justice.
[01:27:46.365 --> 01:27:56.574]  That the new nominee, Kagan, I just hope that she is not put on the Supreme Court for the views that you mentioned as far as the First and Second Amendments, because that would be devastating.
[01:27:56.574 --> 01:28:09.926]  I don't want, because already the Court is tilting towards a certain way as far as restricting rights, I think, and I don't want another person on there to make a critical vote on a certain issue.
[01:28:09.926 --> 01:28:10.887]  I mean, that would just really
[01:28:11.641 --> 01:28:15.064]  Cut further into our Constitution as it's already being attacked.
[01:28:15.064 --> 01:28:17.587]  Yeah, Stevens had some problems.
[01:28:17.587 --> 01:28:23.072]  He had some problems, but he is a Thomas Jefferson compared to Elena Kagan.
[01:28:23.072 --> 01:28:28.396]  I mean, this woman, this woman could only be on a Nazi or Soviet court.
[01:28:28.396 --> 01:28:32.320]  I mean, literally, she is a dictator wannabe.
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:34.222]  She is a thug.
[01:28:34.222 --> 01:28:36.584]  And it just shows how far we've gone.
[01:28:37.805 --> 01:28:39.426]  She's almost unopposed right now.
[01:28:39.426 --> 01:28:41.448]  We've got to get this out on talk radio.
[01:28:41.448 --> 01:28:43.069]  We've got to get this out in the newspapers.
[01:28:43.069 --> 01:28:44.030]  Letters to the editor.
[01:28:44.030 --> 01:28:45.892]  We've got to call the Senate.
[01:28:45.892 --> 01:28:48.814]  We've got to call the Senate Judiciary Committee.
[01:28:48.814 --> 01:28:55.699]  We have got to raise Cain over this issue.
[01:28:55.699 --> 01:29:04.927]  As you were talking, as the last call was talking about, as you were speaking about a possible cyber attack on the Internet and for it to be caused to have a second Internet or Internet 2.
[01:29:05.948 --> 01:29:14.296]  Another thing that I'm concerned about is that in addition to doing that, someone can actually, with the media, they can say that Iran did it.
[01:29:14.296 --> 01:29:17.158]  And there will be another reason to demonize Iran.
[01:29:17.158 --> 01:29:18.920]  Well, they're already framing the Chinese.
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:20.041]  They're already framing the Chinese.
[01:29:20.041 --> 01:29:21.302]  They're saying they're going to do it.
[01:29:21.302 --> 01:29:23.324]  And Google's had to merge with the NSA.
[01:29:23.324 --> 01:29:25.706]  They were always NSA.
[01:29:25.706 --> 01:29:27.468]  But yeah, they can say Iran as well.
[01:29:27.468 --> 01:29:31.711]  But right now, they're pre-framing China for this.
[01:29:32.872 --> 01:29:34.573]  As if China's involved in it.
[01:29:34.573 --> 01:29:34.893]  U.S.
[01:29:34.893 --> 01:29:38.015]  companies helped China build its censorship grid.
[01:29:38.015 --> 01:29:42.197]  Great points, Grady, John, Tim, Tom and others.
[01:29:42.197 --> 01:29:43.278]  You're called straight ahead.
[01:29:43.278 --> 01:29:45.239]  You want to call in from Thailand or Bangkok?
[01:29:45.239 --> 01:29:45.779]  800-259-9231.
[01:29:45.779 --> 01:29:51.222]  We want to hear what you have to say about that.
[01:29:51.222 --> 01:29:52.623]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.623 --> 01:29:55.144]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.144 --> 01:29:57.826]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.658 --> 01:30:03.039]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:30:03.039 --> 01:30:05.359]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:30:05.359 --> 01:30:08.580]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:13.682]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:30:13.682 --> 01:30:17.863]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:30:18.183 --> 01:30:20.525]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:30:20.525 --> 01:30:23.407]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:30:23.407 --> 01:30:26.330]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:30:26.330 --> 01:30:33.936]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:30:34.269 --> 01:30:39.651]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:30:39.651 --> 01:30:41.971]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:30:41.971 --> 01:30:46.192]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:30:46.192 --> 01:30:47.113]  And I got news for you.
[01:30:47.113 --> 01:30:48.613]  You're everyone else.
[01:30:48.613 --> 01:30:50.094]  Invisible Empire.

[01:31:00.447 --> 01:31:08.450]  In March, Alex Jones announced that eFoodsDirect was putting together a high-volume, pre-production order of the new Quick Fix meals.
[01:31:08.450 --> 01:31:15.794]  By waiting for production and shipping of their orders, families were able to receive one free item for every three that they bought.
[01:31:15.794 --> 01:31:22.777]  Since the final shutdown of this buy three, get one free program, we've had a lot of folks calling, disappointed that they missed the order deadline.
[01:31:22.777 --> 01:31:23.617]  Listen carefully.
[01:31:23.997 --> 01:31:33.726]  Starting immediately, eFoodsDirect.com will take pre-production orders for a buy three get one free program for one week ending May 14th at midnight.
[01:31:33.726 --> 01:31:37.949]  You will receive one free item for every three that you order of the selected products.
[01:31:37.949 --> 01:31:40.952]  These orders will begin shipping the first week of June.
[01:31:40.952 --> 01:31:45.155]  To order on the web, eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex or call 800-409-5633.
[01:31:45.155 --> 01:31:46.076]  That's eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex
[01:31:51.120 --> 01:32:04.392]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:32:04.392 --> 01:32:10.397]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:32:10.777 --> 01:32:18.163]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:32:18.163 --> 01:32:23.046]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:32:23.046 --> 01:32:31.713]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[01:32:31.713 --> 01:32:35.456]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:32:35.956 --> 01:32:42.720]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:46.622]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:32:46.622 --> 01:32:52.985]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[01:32:52.985 --> 01:32:54.205]  Thank you.
[01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:14.836]  There is an amazing article up on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:33:14.836 --> 01:33:20.982]  Oath Keepers proves that there were troops who refused to confiscate guns during Katrina.
[01:33:22.230 --> 01:33:28.573]  Amazing article and video up on Infowars.com right now.
[01:33:28.573 --> 01:33:33.055]  And they've got the names of the troops who were there and refused to confiscate the guns.
[01:33:33.055 --> 01:33:38.238]  We'll cover that some with Gary Franchi coming up in the last hour today.
[01:33:38.238 --> 01:33:42.260]  But let's now go back to your calls, hurry through your calls.
[01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:43.981]  Let's talk to John in Florida.
[01:33:43.981 --> 01:33:44.601]  You're on the air.
[01:33:44.601 --> 01:33:47.963]  How you doing buddy?
[01:33:47.963 --> 01:33:48.303]  Good sir.
[01:33:49.304 --> 01:33:51.245]  Uh, listen, very important, a couple of things.
[01:33:51.245 --> 01:33:51.826]  I'm a U.S.
[01:33:51.826 --> 01:33:52.926]  paratrooper.
[01:33:52.926 --> 01:34:04.813]  Number one thing I need you to really do is start hammering to the troops every single day that they need to, uh, number one, report everything they see, start making videotapes and getting it out.
[01:34:04.813 --> 01:34:05.294]  Number two,
[01:34:05.854 --> 01:34:12.359]  People who have family and friends in the military need to call everybody they know and let them know what's going on.
[01:34:12.359 --> 01:34:14.821]  Because this is a huge awakening.
[01:34:14.821 --> 01:34:17.703]  And I was so encouraged by Colonel Six yesterday.
[01:34:17.703 --> 01:34:20.545]  It was the happiest thing I've heard in a long time.
[01:34:20.545 --> 01:34:35.297]  Also, any military people on bases at C4 and troops need to go up and engage them and let them know that they need to go home and to tell their commanders that they want to go home and there's no need to be here and it's only going to be dangerous for them.
[01:34:36.518 --> 01:34:36.919]  We're good.
[01:34:53.138 --> 01:34:54.840]  Well, I do see a huge awakening.
[01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:57.163]  What are you seeing there in Florida?
[01:35:14.139 --> 01:35:17.120]  I'm seeing people everywhere that I talk to.
[01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:21.902]  Little old ladies to young people who are awake to what's happening.
[01:35:21.902 --> 01:35:24.244]  Police who are awake to what's happening.
[01:35:24.244 --> 01:35:25.384]  And that's the other thing.
[01:35:25.384 --> 01:35:29.266]  Have military people call their local sheriff at home and say,
[01:35:29.926 --> 01:35:39.653]  This is what's going on here, and you're the law of the land, and we want to work with you to save this country, that we're never letting foreign troops in here, we're never letting U.N.
[01:35:39.653 --> 01:35:45.857]  troops in here, and by the way, I wanted to tell you, back in 1993, uh, yes, 93, I was in the U.R.A.
[01:35:45.857 --> 01:35:57.785]  National Forest at Robin Sage, where, you know, where they do the Special Forces training, and we were the OPFOR for them, and we were searching civilian vehicles on civilian land,
[01:35:58.545 --> 01:35:58.866]  I'm good.
[01:36:13.342 --> 01:36:19.206]  Oh, I've been to the urban warfare drills in California and Florida, other areas.
[01:36:19.206 --> 01:36:23.048]  They pull over real people who don't know.
[01:36:23.048 --> 01:36:30.072]  And this is a huge secret program to desensitize the police, the military, and the general population, the civilians.
[01:36:30.072 --> 01:36:32.153]  And now it's coming to a head.
[01:36:32.153 --> 01:36:35.595]  But, I mean, look at Obama's people openly saying they want to
[01:36:36.716 --> 01:36:38.557]  Restrict free speech in America?
[01:36:38.557 --> 01:36:43.241]  Have the military secretly arrest citizens and pull their citizenship?
[01:36:43.241 --> 01:36:50.185]  And all the secret documents that we've gotten that have made national news show that the real target is the American people.
[01:36:50.185 --> 01:36:52.287]  That the military is being trained en masse.
[01:36:53.027 --> 01:36:53.247]  I think?
[01:37:11.132 --> 01:37:13.833]  That's what's waking the troops up, is that mind control.
[01:37:13.833 --> 01:37:19.435]  It's like the government saying, we don't bring drugs in, but we do grow the opium and help ship it out.
[01:37:19.435 --> 01:37:30.699]  I mean, how bold are these people to think that they can have Fox News announce the government's growing opium, the troops have to protect it in Afghanistan, but it's a good thing.
[01:37:30.699 --> 01:37:32.680]  I mean, it's just, it's mind control.
[01:37:33.959 --> 01:37:35.100]  Yeah, it is Alex.
[01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:36.561]  Let me tell you one other thing too.
[01:37:36.561 --> 01:37:42.124]  I have a friend who's a senior non-commissioned officer who I talked to about a month and a half ago.
[01:37:42.124 --> 01:37:43.425]  And I said, what are you doing right now?
[01:37:43.425 --> 01:37:47.087]  And he said, well, I'm down in Mississippi and we're looking at infrastructure.
[01:37:47.087 --> 01:37:53.230]  I said, what on Dodge Green Earth would you be doing looking at infrastructure as an infantry officer down in Mississippi?
[01:37:53.230 --> 01:37:55.352]  So that was, that was highly suspect.
[01:37:55.352 --> 01:38:00.855]  And what it is, I think, is a lot of these military people are just like, what's his name brought up about the Manhattan Project?
[01:38:01.195 --> 01:38:04.318]  A lot of people are working on things, but they don't exactly know what they're doing.
[01:38:21.053 --> 01:38:23.774]  Okay, here's coffee and donuts, here's what Al-Qaeda looks like.
[01:38:23.774 --> 01:38:27.095]  You know, if you see anybody, you know, doing this, call the police.
[01:38:27.095 --> 01:38:29.315]  And the next meeting is, watch your neighbors.
[01:38:29.315 --> 01:38:30.096]  What are they saying?
[01:38:30.096 --> 01:38:31.316]  Do they have guns?
[01:38:31.316 --> 01:38:33.016]  Do they have marijuana?
[01:38:33.016 --> 01:38:34.877]  Are they spanking their kids?
[01:38:34.877 --> 01:38:38.098]  You've got to go tell your flocks to submit to gun confiscation.
[01:38:38.098 --> 01:38:45.180]  So there's been this huge, covert propaganda, just like they've had Marines run checkpoints all over the country to, quote, stop drunk drivers.
[01:38:45.620 --> 01:38:48.684]  Again, it's meant to sound like, well, you're against drunk drivers, aren't you?
[01:38:48.684 --> 01:38:50.405]  It's meant to set that precedent.
[01:38:50.405 --> 01:38:56.152]  Then by the fourth or fifth drill, they're doing gun confiscation operations, and that's even been in mainstream news.
[01:38:56.152 --> 01:39:00.877]  So this is how they're trying to do a mind warp on the troops, but the good news is,
[01:39:01.678 --> 01:39:11.048]  The troops clearly are waking up ahead of the staged terror attack, and so if the globalists go ahead with the staged terror attack, it's not going to go well with them.
[01:39:11.048 --> 01:39:11.549]  God bless you.
[01:39:11.549 --> 01:39:13.711]  I appreciate your call, John.
[01:39:13.711 --> 01:39:14.812]  Jim in California.
[01:39:14.812 --> 01:39:16.834]  You're on the air.
[01:39:16.834 --> 01:39:17.575]  Alex.
[01:39:17.575 --> 01:39:18.816]  Hey, buddy.
[01:39:18.816 --> 01:39:19.737]  How you doing today?
[01:39:19.737 --> 01:39:19.977]  Good.
[01:39:19.977 --> 01:39:20.238]  Go ahead.
[01:39:21.351 --> 01:39:24.394]  Okay, I'm a day trader, and you wanted to know where the market's going.
[01:39:24.394 --> 01:39:25.875]  I've been doing this for three years.
[01:39:25.875 --> 01:39:29.879]  I used to work for PPG, and I've worked for big coding companies in the past.
[01:39:29.879 --> 01:39:33.042]  My real trade is a corrosion engineer.
[01:39:33.042 --> 01:39:35.544]  But this market is going directly down.
[01:39:35.544 --> 01:39:43.431]  It may peak its head up here and there, but it's already lost close to 800 points in the last couple weeks.
[01:39:43.431 --> 01:39:43.992]  What do you think?
[01:39:46.465 --> 01:39:49.227]  Well, what they do is they bring the U.S.
[01:39:49.227 --> 01:39:57.411]  down 19 months ago, then they bring the Euro up, then they bring the Euro down, then they'll bring us down.
[01:39:57.411 --> 01:40:03.274]  But they stagger it where Europe goes down, we go up, then Europe goes up, we go down.
[01:40:03.274 --> 01:40:08.337]  But if you look at the graph, they're really going down in concert together.
[01:40:08.337 --> 01:40:11.439]  They're just staggering it, and that way the big
[01:40:12.339 --> 01:40:27.861]  Brokerage firms that have the insider knowledge and the black boxes and the plunge protection team at the federal government working for them They basically have rigged the market to amass wealth and power while getting nation states and deeper debt to them and I agree I mean the market is
[01:40:29.655 --> 01:40:39.242]  Right.
[01:40:39.242 --> 01:40:50.130]  And if you don't have gold and silver, and if you don't take your money out of the bank soon, you're going to be a sorry customer.
[01:40:50.130 --> 01:40:51.752]  I'm telling you that right now.
[01:40:51.752 --> 01:40:57.616]  Everybody needs... You know, Alex, if everybody went to their bank and took out their money, what would happen?
[01:40:59.983 --> 01:41:04.908]  There would be a collapse of the big central banks.
[01:41:04.908 --> 01:41:07.650]  And then the people would take control.
[01:41:07.650 --> 01:41:10.633]  We need to get control back away from these banks.
[01:41:10.633 --> 01:41:13.756]  Why doesn't everybody go into the banks, withdraw their money,
[01:41:14.318 --> 01:41:20.539]  Buy gold and silver, rat hole a little cash, and start trading amongst ourselves, and forget these big banks.
[01:41:20.539 --> 01:41:23.040]  It's all, this whole market is hocus-pocus.
[01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:27.901]  It's going directly into Hades, and I'm telling you, the general public doesn't have a clue.
[01:41:27.901 --> 01:41:35.263]  They think their 401ks have come back, they think this, that, the other thing is getting better because mainstream media tells them that way.
[01:41:36.102 --> 01:41:39.144]  They're in la-la land, they don't... Well, look at Europe!
[01:41:39.144 --> 01:41:49.511]  Europe is on the verge of total collapse, and it won't fully collapse, it'll just collapse into the banker's hands even more, and it'll just be an incremental collapse.
[01:41:49.511 --> 01:41:52.132]  They're going to do this slowly.
[01:41:52.132 --> 01:41:53.833]  That's what all the evidence shows.
[01:41:53.833 --> 01:41:57.876]  Or, they could just completely implode it, and then
[01:41:59.713 --> 01:42:08.097]  They're so-called life raft or life buoy that they'll throw us will be total banking dictatorship with even more power and control.
[01:42:08.097 --> 01:42:09.397]  But I agree with you.
[01:42:09.397 --> 01:42:11.478]  A year is a twinkling of the eye.
[01:42:11.478 --> 01:42:15.920]  And so in the aggregate, in the sum total, markets are going straight down.
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:19.842]  It may go up for a while, down for a while, up for a while, down for a while, but overall
[01:42:20.908 --> 01:42:27.353]  It's all going straight down and governments are openly saying, we're coming for your pension funds.
[01:42:27.353 --> 01:42:32.076]  And private corporations are already devaluing or looting the pension funds.
[01:42:32.076 --> 01:42:35.699]  Government is talking about taking part or all the pension funds.
[01:42:35.699 --> 01:42:41.343]  Companies are creating spinoffs and shutting down the old division to not pay pension funds.
[01:42:41.343 --> 01:42:45.206]  They're engaged in every form of criminal chicanery known to man.
[01:42:45.206 --> 01:42:46.707]  I appreciate your call, Jim.
[01:42:46.707 --> 01:42:48.389]  Tom in Connecticut, you're on the air.
[01:42:50.728 --> 01:42:51.388]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:42:51.388 --> 01:42:51.529]  Good!
[01:43:04.097 --> 01:43:07.078]  Yeah, I'm going to have to let you go.
[01:43:07.078 --> 01:43:08.319]  Your phone's having a big problem.
[01:43:08.319 --> 01:43:11.640]  If you can get back in on a good phone line, we'll have you on.
[01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:14.861]  Again, we can only take phones that we can actually understand and hear.
[01:43:14.861 --> 01:43:18.162]  If we can't understand you, we're not going to be able to have you on air.
[01:43:18.162 --> 01:43:20.763]  Let's go ahead and talk to Amy in Ohio.
[01:43:20.763 --> 01:43:21.564]  Amy, you're on the air.
[01:43:21.564 --> 01:43:23.484]  Hi, Alex.
[01:43:23.484 --> 01:43:24.725]  Hi.
[01:43:24.725 --> 01:43:28.887]  I just found out about you through a lot of different things.
[01:43:28.887 --> 01:43:32.268]  The 9-11, the conspiracy, different things.
[01:43:32.898 --> 01:43:39.821]  You know, you're talking about the One World Government, and I don't think, I guess some people are blind to it.
[01:43:39.821 --> 01:43:44.843]  The One World Government happened right back in 2009.
[01:43:44.843 --> 01:43:53.306]  They give a time that when it happened, when it was established, it's just like you said, it's been going on with the Bilderbergs, all these different people.
[01:43:53.306 --> 01:43:55.587]  And I like what your last guy just said.
[01:43:55.587 --> 01:44:01.290]  What would happen if we as Americans just went, got our money out of the banks?
[01:44:01.290 --> 01:44:01.910]  What would happen?
[01:44:02.990 --> 01:44:11.075]  Because from some of the information I found out, they're trying to actually take it down to like 8 banks in the world.
[01:44:11.075 --> 01:44:16.898]  To where the one world government controls everything.
[01:44:16.898 --> 01:44:23.302]  Well, it'd be kind of like if your leg was sticking out a door and a lion grabbed it.
[01:44:24.392 --> 01:44:33.986]  Would you hack off your leg because the lion had a hold of it and if you didn't hack off your leg, the lion would get your whole body.
[01:44:33.986 --> 01:44:39.734]  And it is the avoidance of crisis, the avoidance of a fight, it is the avoidance of a struggle
[01:44:40.735 --> 01:44:47.859]  And the fact that people keep, you know, wanting to just passively resist this, that has allowed them to get us to this point.
[01:44:47.859 --> 01:44:53.602]  And the lion will eat us one piece at a time unless we get our leg out of their mouth.
[01:44:53.602 --> 01:45:05.509]  Now, instead of having a hatchet to hack off our own leg, I would rather politically... Again, there's a hole in the wall, our leg's sticking out, a lion's got a hold of it trying to pull us to the wall.
[01:45:05.509 --> 01:45:06.790]  I would rather politically
[01:45:08.103 --> 01:45:11.829]  Have a .357 Magnum and shoot the lion right between the eyes.
[01:45:11.829 --> 01:45:17.277]  And I don't mean that in a violent way, I mean politically have grand juries start indicting these big banks.
[01:45:17.277 --> 01:45:18.599]  Like Iceland's doing.
[01:45:18.599 --> 01:45:20.722]  Like Greece is now starting to talk about doing.
[01:45:20.722 --> 01:45:22.645]  Like Merkel's being forced to talk about doing.
[01:45:23.766 --> 01:45:32.838]  In between her losing political power and maybe even going to jail, the rats are now starting to jump from the sinking ship.
[01:45:32.838 --> 01:45:40.949]  And so why not just nationalize the big eight banks who are using government to nationalize us and take all our wealth and give it to them?
[01:45:41.769 --> 01:45:48.393]  That's why they're nationalizing the car industry, healthcare, everything, so they can control it.
[01:45:48.393 --> 01:45:51.694]  So it's offshore big banks that are controlling society through government.
[01:45:51.694 --> 01:45:59.239]  So, skip the government and use the state government and grand juries to go after these bankers.
[01:45:59.239 --> 01:46:09.985]  And we can do that by discrediting them, by pointing out they're a bunch of Madoff-slash-Kenley-type crooks, and by pointing out that they are going to incrementally drain us
[01:46:10.945 --> 01:46:12.927]  If we don't stand up against them.
[01:46:12.927 --> 01:46:17.731]  So, I don't know if hacking our leg off to get away from the lion is the way to go.
[01:46:17.731 --> 01:46:22.075]  I mean, I think it is good to pull our money out of mega banks, put it in local banks.
[01:46:22.075 --> 01:46:24.818]  I've been doing that in the last few weeks.
[01:46:24.818 --> 01:46:28.201]  You know, from even regional banks to local banks.
[01:46:28.201 --> 01:46:29.923]  There's a lot of things that need to be done.
[01:46:29.923 --> 01:46:31.684]  So, yes.
[01:46:31.684 --> 01:46:33.906]  The problem is, if you're running a medium-sized business,
[01:46:34.947 --> 01:46:36.128]  I just was going to say too that
[01:47:04.125 --> 01:47:16.008]  One of the leading economists of the world has been on a lot of different shows, not like Fox News, because, I mean, you've opened my eyes to a lot of things when you really do listen.
[01:47:16.008 --> 01:47:23.170]  There's an agenda behind all the media that's on TV, that's why I've pretty much quit watching it.
[01:47:23.170 --> 01:47:32.092]  A guy, Larry Bates is his name, he's a world economist, he said, he had a good friend that tried to even
[01:47:32.725 --> 01:47:33.405]  I appreciate your call.
[01:47:33.405 --> 01:47:41.770]  Ron Paul has been trying to audit the Fed and it got up to the Senate and they created a new bill and stripped his bill and it was a betrayal by
[01:47:56.912 --> 01:47:58.433]  Bernie Sanders.
[01:47:58.433 --> 01:48:04.217]  And it was a betrayal by Grayson when he came out and said, we've beaten the Fed.
[01:48:04.217 --> 01:48:10.161]  Well, they're still there and it's not a real audit.
[01:48:10.161 --> 01:48:14.964]  But again, we've gone from no co-sponsors 25 years ago for Ron Paul's legislation
[01:48:17.073 --> 01:48:30.001]  Hey Alex, long time listener, first time caller.
[01:48:30.001 --> 01:48:36.584]  I'm a member of We Are Change Chicago, a member of Young Americans for Liberty, Campaign for Liberty.
[01:48:36.584 --> 01:48:37.565]  I'm a freedom fighter.
[01:48:37.565 --> 01:48:38.725]  I'm a liberty lover.
[01:48:38.725 --> 01:48:44.869]  And when I see an affront to freedom of speech, our most basic inalienable right with this Keegan,
[01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:47.061]  I mean, this disgusts me.
[01:48:47.061 --> 01:49:01.435]  As a patriot, as a sovereign American, how can somebody who has no judicial experience, who is a Goldman Sachs member, and who has written papers about just getting rid of freedom of speech, I mean, she might call it disappearance.
[01:49:01.435 --> 01:49:05.099]  To me, that's unconstitutional in every way.
[01:49:05.984 --> 01:49:07.325]  Well, it's not just that quote.
[01:49:07.325 --> 01:49:11.208]  The mainstream media picked up her more mild quotes.
[01:49:11.208 --> 01:49:12.709]  I mean, there's literally dozens of them.
[01:49:12.709 --> 01:49:27.720]  Paul Watson's doing an article right now on that for PrisonPlanet.com, and her boss, Cass Sunstein, is in white papers and at the White House and in speeches and on talk radio saying they are going to ban our free speech.
[01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:32.123]  What right do they have to tell us what we can and can't say?
[01:49:32.123 --> 01:49:33.304]  Well, they have to.
[01:49:33.304 --> 01:49:34.125]  They're setting up
[01:49:35.242 --> 01:49:36.123]  Well, they already set it up.
[01:49:36.123 --> 01:49:39.025]  They're expanding their banking dictatorship.
[01:49:39.025 --> 01:49:40.646]  It's totally illegal.
[01:49:40.646 --> 01:49:42.808]  And this is just the cherry on top.
[01:49:42.808 --> 01:49:51.495]  There is no more room for anyone to deny that we have a pack of looting crooks running our society.
[01:49:51.495 --> 01:49:54.858]  And we better reach out to the military and police right now.
[01:49:56.385 --> 01:49:58.926]  And shake them out of the mind control they're under.
[01:49:58.926 --> 01:50:01.966]  A lot of them have already woken up, but I mean, come on!
[01:50:01.966 --> 01:50:03.787]  This is the bad guys.
[01:50:03.787 --> 01:50:07.608]  We're looking at the bad guys at the federal level.
[01:50:07.608 --> 01:50:09.888]  And they're destroying all of our futures together.
[01:50:09.888 --> 01:50:11.369]  We're all in this together.
[01:50:11.369 --> 01:50:15.910]  Even if you think you're part of the New World Order at some mid-level, you are not part of it, okay?
[01:50:15.910 --> 01:50:18.110]  You are going to be trashed by this.
[01:50:18.110 --> 01:50:20.311]  You may do good for another year or two under their system.
[01:50:20.851 --> 01:50:25.755]  Okay, but as tyrannies come in, they always cull the group that brought them to power.
[01:50:25.755 --> 01:50:27.396]  They will at least fire you.
[01:50:27.396 --> 01:50:37.863]  You're like an IBM engineer who is forced to train his replacements for six months, then being fired, and even being told he's going to be fired after he trains them.
[01:50:37.863 --> 01:50:44.929]  I know a bunch of people here in Austin, company after company, factory after factory, IBM, Dell, you name it.
[01:50:45.589 --> 01:50:51.393]  And they even tell them, you're gonna take a cut and pay by half, and then when you train these people, you're fired.
[01:50:51.393 --> 01:50:56.396]  And instead of all the engineers and people getting together and saying no, they go along with it.
[01:50:56.396 --> 01:50:56.776]  Okay?
[01:50:56.776 --> 01:51:00.319]  You gotta get your fighting spirit, folks, or they're gonna take everything you've got!
[01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:02.681]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.681 --> 01:51:08.267]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:08.267 --> 01:51:13.292]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.292 --> 01:51:18.857]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:18.857 --> 01:51:24.102]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:24.102 --> 01:51:25.964]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:51:26.385 --> 01:51:31.188]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:31.188 --> 01:51:32.309]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:32.309 --> 01:51:35.370]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:35.370 --> 01:51:38.992]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.992 --> 01:51:42.194]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:42.194 --> 01:51:44.396]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:44.396 --> 01:51:45.296]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:45.296 --> 01:51:45.536]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:45.536 --> 01:51:46.657]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[01:51:55.495 --> 01:51:58.036]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:58.036 --> 01:52:01.117]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:01.117 --> 01:52:02.098]  Here's a question.
[01:52:02.098 --> 01:52:08.300]  If you have a septic system, did you know that proper maintenance can save you thousands of dollars in costly and unnecessary repairs?
[01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:09.681]  The answer is simple.

[01:52:43.334 --> 01:52:43.574]  I think.
[01:53:01.016 --> 01:53:02.156]  Fatigue.
[01:53:02.156 --> 01:53:03.277]  Headaches.
[01:53:03.277 --> 01:53:04.617]  Allergies and asthma.
[01:53:04.617 --> 01:53:06.038]  Chronic disease.
[01:53:06.038 --> 01:53:07.878]  Is your home making you sick?
[01:53:07.878 --> 01:53:08.819]  Here's a fact.
[01:53:08.819 --> 01:53:16.801]  Our indoor air quality is getting worse, and the causes include chemicals, toxic gases, dust, pollen, dander, and even chemtrail particulates.

[01:53:38.268 --> 01:53:38.768]  All the lasers out!
[01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:08.221]  The truth is spreading fast.
[01:54:08.221 --> 01:54:11.461]  The people are awakening faster by the millisecond.
[01:54:11.461 --> 01:54:13.722]  But it's not enough.
[01:54:13.722 --> 01:54:18.963]  I need more from you, the listeners, to spread the word about what's happening with the New World Order.
[01:54:18.963 --> 01:54:20.124]  I mean, here's a quick example.
[01:54:20.124 --> 01:54:23.885]  We have the free iPhone app that 40,000 people have downloaded.
[01:54:24.773 --> 01:54:27.356]  Okay, go there, give it five star rating.
[01:54:27.356 --> 01:54:29.217]  It had a five star rating.
[01:54:29.217 --> 01:54:34.102]  When I even saw a website, just happened to run into it saying, go here, download it, and rate it down.
[01:54:34.102 --> 01:54:37.865]  Because very few apps have five stars, it only has four now.
[01:54:37.865 --> 01:54:44.251]  Forty something thousand, download it, only a couple thousand rate it, and the enemies pulled it down to four stars.
[01:54:44.251 --> 01:54:45.493]  Get in there, download it.
[01:54:46.713 --> 01:54:54.161]  Email the link to your friends and family who are out there that have iPhones and say, here's the free download for a great radio show.
[01:54:54.161 --> 01:54:58.626]  Send people the free podcast download that has over 200,000 people downloading it a day.
[01:54:58.626 --> 01:55:01.590]  Send them the live audio streams that have over 300,000 tuning in a day.
[01:55:03.792 --> 01:55:10.958]  And again, the internet is small compared to our AM and FM affiliates, but it's growing so fast, and we can reach people anywhere.
[01:55:10.958 --> 01:55:19.106]  Germany, the Netherlands, South Africa, Brazil, Mexico, Canada, it doesn't matter.
[01:55:19.106 --> 01:55:21.588]  You don't have to have an AM and FM in your area.
[01:55:21.588 --> 01:55:26.072]  But if you have an AM and FM and you're listening to us, stop your car, get a sandwich board out,
[01:55:26.152 --> 01:55:29.735]  Tell people about the show, get my films, make copies, give them to everyone you know.
[01:55:29.735 --> 01:55:36.240]  This radio broadcast and my films and the work we do are the most effective tools out there next to Ron Paul.
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:38.842]  And we're more hardcore because we can be more hardcore.
[01:55:38.842 --> 01:55:40.023]  He's in Congress.
[01:55:40.023 --> 01:55:45.248]  So we're here, ladies and gentlemen, and I just want to commend everyone out there that's getting the word out.
[01:55:46.107 --> 01:55:49.629]  I actually, Friday night, did some math.
[01:55:49.629 --> 01:55:57.973]  Spent about an hour on YouTube just randomly with a calculator going to our eight YouTube channels, to my films online.
[01:55:57.973 --> 01:56:01.195]  Just on YouTube, I have to make a correction.
[01:56:01.195 --> 01:56:06.377]  Two hundred million of my videos watched.
[01:56:06.377 --> 01:56:09.639]  Two hundred million in an hour.
[01:56:10.851 --> 01:56:13.492]  I go to one of my channels, 45 million views.
[01:56:13.492 --> 01:56:16.234]  Go to another one of my channels, 15 million views.
[01:56:16.234 --> 01:56:18.575]  Go to another one of my channels, 5 million views.
[01:56:18.575 --> 01:56:20.756]  Go to another one of our channels, 2 million views.
[01:56:20.756 --> 01:56:22.777]  Go to another one of our channels, 3 million views.
[01:56:22.777 --> 01:56:25.198]  Go to another one of our channels, half a million views.
[01:56:25.198 --> 01:56:30.961]  Go to all these other channels that have our stuff, millions and millions of views, and I sat there with a calculator up to 200 million!
[01:56:30.961 --> 01:56:32.882]  200 million of my videos watched!
[01:56:37.825 --> 01:56:40.306]  Alex, thanks for everything you do.
[01:56:40.306 --> 01:56:41.666]  Yeah, I'm in Germany.
[01:57:08.219 --> 01:57:15.282]  I'm working for the government over here, and as you've stated many times, yeah, we're waking up.
[01:57:15.282 --> 01:57:17.343]  A lot of us internally, we know what's going on.
[01:57:17.343 --> 01:57:18.403]  We see it.
[01:57:18.403 --> 01:57:24.546]  A lot of my colleagues, a lot of people I work with, active duty stuff, we see it.
[01:57:24.546 --> 01:57:25.566]  We know what's going on.
[01:57:25.566 --> 01:57:27.447]  We're spreading the word.
[01:57:27.447 --> 01:57:29.848]  You know, we support Ron Paul.
[01:57:29.848 --> 01:57:36.191]  There's many things we do, and basically we want to say thank you very much for helping wake everybody up.
[01:57:37.180 --> 01:57:42.184]  And I wish I could have an hour to talk to you about a lot of the stuff I've seen that goes on.
[01:57:42.184 --> 01:57:55.275]  How a lot of these programs that they're now coming out with internally, new programs called iWatch, basically it's to try to turn us all against each other.
[01:57:55.737 --> 01:58:02.143]  Watch your brother, watch your sister, watch your colleague, and if you see them saying something, doing something, whatever, turn them in.
[01:58:02.143 --> 01:58:04.044]  Yeah, don't watch the bankers.
[01:58:04.044 --> 01:58:05.085]  Don't watch the government.
[01:58:05.085 --> 01:58:11.951]  They've been training kids for 15 years that we know of in major public schools to write reports on mommy and daddy.
[01:58:11.951 --> 01:58:19.118]  That's right, and that's what they're trying to do internally so that anyone that could possibly stand up and revolt, they're trying to get them early.
[01:58:19.904 --> 01:58:21.265]  And, but we know.
[01:58:21.265 --> 01:58:23.826]  Well, I tell you what, Randy, I want you to be able to finish up.
[01:58:23.826 --> 01:58:29.529]  Max Keiser's coming up in just a moment, but I want to come back and give you two minutes to talk about any other key info you've got.
[01:58:29.529 --> 01:58:34.812]  Then Max Keiser for the rest of the hour, then Gary Franchi and Webster Tarpoli on his take on Thailand.
[01:58:34.812 --> 01:58:35.752]  Stay there, Randy.
[01:58:35.752 --> 01:58:37.013]  Back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:37.013 --> 01:58:42.876]  Then Shea, Mookie, Tom and others.
[01:58:42.876 --> 01:58:44.257]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:44.257 --> 01:58:47.598]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:52.028 --> 01:59:00.514]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[01:59:00.514 --> 01:59:11.401]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[01:59:11.401 --> 01:59:16.845]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[01:59:17.385 --> 01:59:22.268]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[01:59:22.268 --> 01:59:31.354]  Colloidal Silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[01:59:31.354 --> 01:59:41.461]  Go to www.silverlungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own Colloidal Silver right from home.
[01:59:41.461 --> 01:59:45.144]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:59:45.144 --> 01:59:46.164]  Silverlungs.com.
[01:59:53.728 --> 01:59:56.129]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.129 --> 02:00:01.432]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:01.432 --> 02:00:02.552]  Big Brother.
[02:00:02.552 --> 02:00:04.773]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.647 --> 02:00:10.389]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.389 --> 02:00:11.991]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.991 --> 02:00:13.533]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.533 --> 02:00:17.738]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.738 --> 02:00:22.203]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.203 --> 02:00:23.785]  We have reached the waypoint.
[02:00:23.785 --> 02:00:24.866]  The halfway point.
[02:00:25.066 --> 02:00:27.328]  Point of no return in this radio broadcast today.
[02:00:27.328 --> 02:00:31.351]  It is Monday, the 17th day of May, 2010.
[02:00:31.351 --> 02:00:33.813]  Max Keiser coming up in just a few minutes.
[02:00:33.813 --> 02:00:38.057]  He normally joins us once a month, but he was on last week because of all the market situations.
[02:00:38.057 --> 02:00:43.382]  Now a lot of other analysts agree with him that it was a market terrorism, market manipulation.
[02:00:44.102 --> 02:00:47.084]  With the thousand point drop, it's down over a hundred points right now.
[02:00:47.084 --> 02:00:48.725]  Open talk of the Euro imploding.
[02:00:48.725 --> 02:00:55.669]  We're going to discuss it all with Max Keiser and take your calls on the economy and other issues with Max coming up in this hour.
[02:00:55.669 --> 02:00:59.352]  And we are live at PrisonPlanet.tv, now simulcasting the second half.
[02:00:59.352 --> 02:01:02.454]  But Randy is calling in saying he works with the U.S.
[02:01:02.454 --> 02:01:05.856]  military in Germany, and he was saying they're really waking up.
[02:01:05.856 --> 02:01:10.219]  We're hearing the military calling in mass, talking about how they're listening to my show all over the bases.
[02:01:10.939 --> 02:01:18.922]  We've got troops coming out and going public up at Infowars.com with Oath Keepers about how there was a revolt in Katrina, refusing to confiscate guns.
[02:01:18.922 --> 02:01:21.182]  Tyranny comes to your door in a uniform.
[02:01:21.182 --> 02:01:25.144]  And if you can educate the people in uniform, the globalists won't be able to carry this out.
[02:01:25.144 --> 02:01:35.907]  And I've seen major news reports about how the NSA is mainly watching troops and FBI now, not just citizens like myself, because they know there's a huge awakening.
[02:01:36.367 --> 02:01:46.909]  Describe for us, Randy, the type of awakening going on over in Germany, in the military, in the government people over there, and other key points you said you wish you had time to cover.
[02:01:46.909 --> 02:01:48.330]  Well, there's a lot of different things.
[02:01:48.330 --> 02:01:51.970]  For example, I mean, I have bumper stickers, you know, in the Fed.
[02:01:51.970 --> 02:01:53.151]  I support Ron Paul.
[02:01:53.151 --> 02:01:54.311]  Bumper stickers, things like that.
[02:01:54.311 --> 02:01:58.612]  And a lot of people, they'll come up and ask, well, what does that mean, in the Fed?
[02:01:58.612 --> 02:01:59.772]  And it blows my mind.
[02:01:59.772 --> 02:02:00.912]  It really does.
[02:02:00.912 --> 02:02:04.453]  These are, you know, majors, colonels, lieutenant colonels, stuff, have no idea.
[02:02:04.966 --> 02:02:05.466]  And by the way...
[02:02:21.661 --> 02:02:29.987]  I hope they don't try to persecute you and others that are spreading the word, because in national polls, over 80% of Americans want to audit or abolish the Fed.
[02:02:29.987 --> 02:02:34.311]  It was 75% just three months ago, and so you're with the American people.
[02:02:34.311 --> 02:02:39.595]  It's your right to be for auditing this private secretive bank that's been robbing us.
[02:02:39.595 --> 02:02:42.017]  That's right.
[02:02:42.017 --> 02:02:47.721]  You know, on the economy and stuff, because I live in Germany, so I'm kind of, you know, involved in the economy stuff over here.
[02:02:47.721 --> 02:02:51.444]  I don't know where all this bailout money is going to come from that they're helping Greece and everything else out.
[02:02:52.647 --> 02:02:58.671]  A lot of people, you know, in America, you know, we fight taxes and everything else for good reason.
[02:02:58.671 --> 02:03:05.975]  Because over here, your sales tax, for example, is 19% on everything you buy.
[02:03:05.975 --> 02:03:07.416]  They tax your TV.
[02:03:07.416 --> 02:03:09.797]  They give you a church tax.
[02:03:09.797 --> 02:03:17.001]  If you go down and stay in certain hotels and stuff, around the Alps, they tax the air, the water, they tax everything.
[02:03:17.001 --> 02:03:18.862]  These folks are taxed to death.
[02:03:20.705 --> 02:03:23.407]  And now the Germans have been told, by the way the U.S.
[02:03:23.407 --> 02:03:27.191]  is paying for part of it, that they've got to give up more of their pension funds.
[02:03:27.191 --> 02:03:29.093]  The Greeks have been told this.
[02:03:29.093 --> 02:03:32.035]  And so the trillions are going to come out of your pocket.
[02:03:32.035 --> 02:03:36.840]  That's why they're going to unify the tax rates globally by raising them.
[02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:38.881]  That's what the New World Order is.
[02:03:38.881 --> 02:03:42.305]  It's a global corporate model where private central banks
[02:03:43.482 --> 02:03:56.851]  Control the planet, and set global taxes so there's nowhere to run, and that's why the New York Times admits record numbers of wealthy Americans are leaving the country because this is their last chance to get out with their money.
[02:03:56.851 --> 02:04:01.153]  There's only six months left or so, and then you're not getting out with five cents.
[02:04:03.855 --> 02:04:05.417]  So they run to Costa Rica.
[02:04:05.417 --> 02:04:06.919]  So they run to the Cook Islands.
[02:04:06.919 --> 02:04:08.941]  They're going to mop them up next.
[02:04:08.941 --> 02:04:10.443]  We shouldn't be running.
[02:04:10.443 --> 02:04:14.767]  We should be standing and speaking up and identifying this global corporate structure.
[02:04:14.767 --> 02:04:15.468]  Anything else?
[02:04:15.468 --> 02:04:19.052]  We should be standing up like the Thais.
[02:04:19.052 --> 02:04:22.877]  We should be out there revolting like the Thais.
[02:04:22.877 --> 02:04:23.878]  That's what needs to be happening.
[02:04:24.488 --> 02:04:25.809]  Well, Randy, I appreciate your call.
[02:04:25.809 --> 02:04:28.770]  Be safe over there in Germany and keep waking people up.
[02:04:28.770 --> 02:04:34.533]  But there are a lot of ways to revolt, and I'm doing that by educating people and saying, arrest the bankers, bring them to justice.
[02:04:34.533 --> 02:04:40.936]  Not your corner bank, but the Goldman Sachs crooks that are about to put a Supreme Court justice in, who's against free speech and the Second Amendment.
[02:04:41.796 --> 02:04:45.962]  That is a declaration of war against this Republic.
[02:04:45.962 --> 02:04:54.493]  When somebody touches that Bill of Rights, and this isn't touching it, this is burning it to the ground, that's an attack on every single American, regardless of what color you are.
[02:04:54.493 --> 02:04:57.637]  And that's why they want us fighting over race instead of the real issues.
[02:04:57.637 --> 02:04:58.338]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:00.728 --> 02:05:02.029]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:02.029 --> 02:05:07.612]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:05:07.612 --> 02:05:12.615]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:05:12.615 --> 02:05:17.658]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:05:18.198 --> 02:05:23.422]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:05:23.422 --> 02:05:25.723]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:05:25.723 --> 02:05:30.546]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.

[02:05:31.647 --> 02:05:34.729]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:05:34.729 --> 02:05:38.352]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:05:38.352 --> 02:05:41.534]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[02:05:48.318 --> 02:05:51.281]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:05:51.281 --> 02:05:57.385]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:05:57.385 --> 02:06:00.788]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:06:00.788 --> 02:06:07.453]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.

[02:06:38.222 --> 02:06:39.442]  Others don't.

[02:06:57.968 --> 02:06:58.768]  Others don't.
[02:07:04.421 --> 02:07:05.682]  Tyranny is here.
[02:07:05.682 --> 02:07:09.446]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:07:09.446 --> 02:07:11.868]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:07:11.868 --> 02:07:17.734]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[02:07:17.734 --> 02:07:23.961]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:07:24.381 --> 02:07:30.325]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:07:30.325 --> 02:07:34.528]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:07:34.528 --> 02:07:38.831]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:07:38.831 --> 02:07:44.775]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:07:44.775 --> 02:07:48.338]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:07:48.338 --> 02:07:50.319]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:07:50.319 --> 02:07:50.740]  It's here.

[02:08:12.317 --> 02:08:13.859]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.859 --> 02:08:18.065]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.065 --> 02:08:22.832]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:22.832 --> 02:08:25.315]  We're live eight minutes into the third hour.
[02:08:25.936 --> 02:08:28.117]  Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com.
[02:08:28.117 --> 02:08:35.800]  He's had television programs on BBC, Al Jazeera, RT, being picked up for its second highly rated season.
[02:08:35.800 --> 02:08:36.780]  He is with us.
[02:08:36.780 --> 02:08:37.761]  He's normally here once a month.
[02:08:37.761 --> 02:08:43.663]  This is his scheduled monthly visit, but I had him on last week because of the quickening and his predictions coming true.
[02:08:43.663 --> 02:08:51.906]  After he was on, what, last Monday, breaking down the fact that there was clear evidence that this was financial terrorism with a thousand point plunge,
[02:08:52.426 --> 02:09:12.510]  And that the financial wolves, or hyenas, the wolf packs, were bringing down Europe, the very same central banks controlled by the big brokerage firms and investment banks like JPMorgan, Chase, Goldman Sachs, Trichet's now saying, I need more power, and we need more US and German money.
[02:09:12.970 --> 02:09:14.411]  Yeah man, great to be back with you Alex!
[02:09:34.884 --> 02:09:37.828]  Alright my friend, you've got the floor for the balance of this segment.
[02:09:37.828 --> 02:09:51.007]  Lay out where we are, what's happening, what's going on in Europe, what's going on with Brown stepping down, Merkel in trouble, saying the banks are criminal, what's happening in the markets, a trillion's not enough, they need more, what is happening right now?
[02:09:52.321 --> 02:09:55.444]  Alrighty, well, let's talk first about Greece.
[02:09:55.444 --> 02:10:10.879]  Now, George Papandreou, the leader in Greece, he made a statement yesterday, over the weekend, that he's now going to investigate what role the Wall Street banks played in destabilizing his country, his economy.
[02:10:10.879 --> 02:10:12.681]  And this is through some back-channel
[02:10:13.261 --> 02:10:27.750]  Uh, communication between myself and folks in Greece, and I've been trying to steer them in the right direction, telling them this isn't a market problem, it's not a market failure, but it's fraud that's been perpetrated primarily by Wall Street banks.
[02:10:27.750 --> 02:10:38.836]  And my message got through, and he said yesterday that he hears words like, uh, a need for transparency, and there's fraud, and now he's going to take a stand against the bankers.
[02:10:39.256 --> 02:10:48.342]  Now, historically, when anybody has taken, anyone in politics has taken a stand against the bankers, they immediately put themselves into, you know, quite a bit of danger.
[02:10:48.342 --> 02:10:59.670]  Because the track record, if you go, you know, even if you read John Perkins' book, Confessions of an Economic Hitman, whenever somebody, a leader of a country, steps up against the bankers, they put themselves into grave danger.
[02:10:59.670 --> 02:11:04.754]  Now, this would be the first time, really, that a major Western economy is taking on the Wall Street banks.
[02:11:05.314 --> 02:11:10.179]  But the people in Greece are out in the streets, and the leadership is responding.
[02:11:10.179 --> 02:11:11.921]  So he's making a statement.
[02:11:11.921 --> 02:11:22.332]  So we're going to see, because there's ample proof that the Wall Street banks purposefully crashed the Greek economy for short-term capital gains.
[02:11:22.332 --> 02:11:25.034]  So that's the first thing that's happening.
[02:11:25.034 --> 02:11:25.875]  What's happening in Iceland,
[02:11:27.282 --> 02:11:36.326]  You know, we made a film in Iceland about the collapse of the krona, the collapse of the Icelandic economy, and I've gotten pretty friendly with a lot of the legislators up in Iceland.
[02:11:36.326 --> 02:11:42.209]  I'm proposing to them that they introduce some new economic citizenship.
[02:11:42.629 --> 02:11:46.431]  So that anyone in the world who wants to escape, for example, a U.S.
[02:11:46.431 --> 02:11:53.553]  citizen who wants to escape the tyranny of the U.S., can buy a passport for Iceland and to make it competitive.
[02:11:53.553 --> 02:11:55.454]  So it only costs $20,000.
[02:11:55.454 --> 02:11:59.496]  Right now there's only two territories or countries that offer economic citizenship.
[02:11:59.496 --> 02:12:00.136]  Nevis, St.
[02:12:00.136 --> 02:12:02.037]  Kitts, and Dominica.
[02:12:02.037 --> 02:12:02.417]  They're both
[02:12:03.037 --> 02:12:04.258]  We're good to go.
[02:12:25.014 --> 02:12:25.894]  Alright, let me stop you.
[02:12:45.559 --> 02:12:46.220]  I don't know.
[02:12:57.915 --> 02:12:59.256]  Okay, the global insurrection is on.
[02:12:59.256 --> 02:13:05.162]  I want to interject this and get your take on it, and I want to back you up here and have you continue.
[02:13:05.162 --> 02:13:06.503]  This is French news agency.
[02:13:06.503 --> 02:13:11.608]  Bankers jailed, sued as Iceland seeks culprits for crisis.
[02:13:11.608 --> 02:13:19.535]  Then a week ago, we saw the Merkel headline where she called, you know, criminal banks causing this, though she's bought and paid for by them.
[02:13:19.535 --> 02:13:20.656]  So isn't that the danger?
[02:13:21.277 --> 02:13:21.617]  I don't know.
[02:13:43.092 --> 02:13:44.413]  I mean, isn't there a danger of that?
[02:13:44.413 --> 02:13:51.156]  Because I've been all over Greek radio and newspapers as well saying, arrest the bankers, arrest Goldman Sachs.
[02:13:51.156 --> 02:13:54.617]  And so you've been putting the pressure on, many others have been putting the pressure on.
[02:13:54.617 --> 02:13:57.238]  So that's a great idea.
[02:13:57.238 --> 02:13:58.719]  Secondarily, how you brought up
[02:13:59.259 --> 02:14:00.079]  Expatriates.
[02:14:00.079 --> 02:14:07.942]  We have the New York Times saying record numbers of wealthy people who aren't globalists leaving because they say this is the last year to get your money out.
[02:14:07.942 --> 02:14:09.162]  Just fleeing en masse.
[02:14:09.162 --> 02:14:12.463]  I'd rather flee to somewhere like Iceland, but I don't even have enough money.
[02:14:12.463 --> 02:14:16.224]  I don't think, like you said, if it was $200,000, then I think I'm going to stay here and go down with the ship.
[02:14:16.224 --> 02:14:20.226]  But for people that do want to escape and be around like-minded people.
[02:14:20.226 --> 02:14:23.787]  But what about the arrests that they're reporting in Iceland?
[02:14:24.892 --> 02:14:25.793]  That's right.
[02:14:25.793 --> 02:14:38.589]  One of the bankers in London, who they say, and rightfully so, was responsible for pilfering $2 billion from the economy, is now being prosecuted.
[02:14:38.589 --> 02:14:42.374]  And, you know, it's funny because London is where a lot of these guys go.
[02:14:43.014 --> 02:15:04.720]  Uh, to get, because the, the hedge fund industry and the banking industry laws are very lenient there, and you end up with a lot of the international banking crooks end up in London, which is one of the reasons why the real estate market in London, on the high end, the very expensive, uh, residencies hasn't, uh, crashed so much, because they're supported by all these, uh, billionaires from these, uh, territories that they've absconded with all the wealth.
[02:15:05.260 --> 02:15:13.764]  So, Iceland is actively going after this guy, and it's funny because in the indictment, they use a very interesting word, Alex.
[02:15:13.764 --> 02:15:15.425]  They use the word counterfeiting.
[02:15:16.349 --> 02:15:29.541]  Now, this is fascinating because counterfeiting in the context of financial crime and financial terrorism, it points to what people know as naked short-selling.
[02:15:29.541 --> 02:15:39.370]  Naked short-selling is really one of the most common incendiary financial devices used to blow up an economy and to blow up a country, to blow up a company.
[02:15:39.370 --> 02:15:42.073]  We saw with Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, naked short-selling.
[02:15:42.333 --> 02:15:48.394]  You're selling something, you're selling a security that doesn't exist, which is the same as counterfeiting.
[02:15:48.394 --> 02:16:04.577]  So now, if they bring this whole naked short-selling scam to the surface, and they call it what it is, counterfeiting, that would point the finger at a lot of the criminality that's going on in the last five to ten years, and really bring in all the banks, because they're all guilty of this naked short-selling to a huge degree.
[02:16:04.577 --> 02:16:11.258]  Now, getting back to your question about, well, the leaders, once they take on Wall Street, are they going to be pressured to back down?
[02:16:12.238 --> 02:16:19.322]  And what we saw last Thursday on May 6th was the first unequivocal domestic financial terrorist attack in America.
[02:16:19.322 --> 02:16:23.145]  You know, there was a bill in Washington to break up the big banks.
[02:16:23.145 --> 02:16:26.506]  They dropped the market by a thousand points.
[02:16:26.506 --> 02:16:27.947]  The lawmakers pulled away.
[02:16:27.947 --> 02:16:30.349]  They decided not to pass that law to break up the big banks.
[02:16:30.349 --> 02:16:34.111]  They also dropped the real lot at the Fed and put a fake one in, according to Ron Paul.
[02:16:34.851 --> 02:16:39.274]  Yeah, so they've got this weapon, which is they can crash a market.
[02:16:39.274 --> 02:16:49.741]  And I'm looking at today's news, and you see now that the financial terrorists are not shy about threatening to blow up people's economies and markets.
[02:16:49.741 --> 02:16:53.403]  For example, this is in today's news, Morgan Stanley said that
[02:16:54.637 --> 02:17:09.113]  If Europe doesn't engage in full-blown quantitative easing, which means that they would buy back their own bonds, which basically would mean to destroy the euro, then Morgan Stanley threatens Europe with a 1987 crash.
[02:17:11.295 --> 02:17:11.836]  Look this up.
[02:17:11.836 --> 02:17:18.244]  Morgan Stanley's full-blown quantitative easing may be needed to save Europe, or else we'll see a 1987-style crash.
[02:17:18.244 --> 02:17:20.947]  So they're threatening Europe with a 1987 crash.
[02:17:20.947 --> 02:17:21.988]  That's Morgan Stanley.
[02:17:21.988 --> 02:17:25.493]  A Wall Street bank is threatening the entire Eurozone.
[02:17:27.615 --> 02:17:39.743]  Here's another headline about KPMG and PricewaterhouseCooper are now considering whether or not they should get back into the business of the rating agencies.
[02:17:39.743 --> 02:17:47.729]  You know, the Moody's, S&P, and Fitch, those rating agencies that gave their blessing to all the structured products and collateralized debt obligations that turned out to be phony?
[02:17:48.249 --> 02:17:57.991]  Well, now all these consulting firms, who are also equally culpable in this nightmarish collapse of the economy, say, well, you know, those guys aren't good enough at it.
[02:17:57.991 --> 02:17:59.351]  We're going to get in the business.
[02:17:59.351 --> 02:18:03.932]  So this is, like, really just exactly the same thing.
[02:18:03.932 --> 02:18:12.114]  The fact that they can, with a straight face, say that they're going to get into the rating agency business, when they themselves are some of the most crooked organizations in the U.S.
[02:18:12.114 --> 02:18:12.594]  economy.
[02:18:12.594 --> 02:18:15.255]  KPMG and Pricewaterhouse is quite laughable.
[02:18:16.035 --> 02:18:25.880]  Here we have General Motors today saying that they want to get back into the financing business because of the shortage of subprime lending is holding back sales.
[02:18:25.880 --> 02:18:34.843]  Now, General Motors getting into the financing business is exactly how the economy crashed to begin with, because they got out of selling cars and they got into the loan sharking business.
[02:18:34.843 --> 02:18:44.828]  Then the economy crashed, then the government gave them billions, and as a thank you to the taxpayer for getting them out of the hole, they're saying, now we want to get back into the loan sharking business.
[02:18:45.248 --> 02:18:46.771]  That only took 12 months!
[02:18:46.771 --> 02:18:48.414]  Yeah, we're not going to build cars.
[02:18:48.414 --> 02:18:58.992]  We're going to move our factories to Asia, to Brazil, and to China, and to Eastern Europe, and then all we're going to do with your bailout money here is loan it back to you, the American people.
[02:18:59.582 --> 02:19:05.346]  At usurious rates, as a loan shark, and we're trying to get you deeper into debt as we possibly can.
[02:19:05.346 --> 02:19:14.792]  And so they're trying to restart the entire cycle of, again, until they blow up, and then they'll require more of a bailout.
[02:19:14.792 --> 02:19:26.540]  And of course, this just perpetuates this move down into what we would call the casino gulag state, where the value of the purchasing power, the wages and the savings,
[02:19:27.381 --> 02:19:29.523]  And the purchasing power of everybody in the U.S.
[02:19:29.523 --> 02:19:39.857]  keeps continuously, uh, degrades and drops and disintegrates and you have this just enormous cesspool, uh, that used to where once a fine country used to, uh, reside.
[02:19:42.694 --> 02:19:43.455]  Well said.
[02:19:43.455 --> 02:19:49.882]  I've got a bunch of questions for you in the next short segment, then we're going to get into other issues you think are important to cover, and then take phone calls.
[02:19:49.882 --> 02:19:52.505]  One of my questions is, will the U.S.
[02:19:52.505 --> 02:19:53.987]  market collapse?
[02:19:53.987 --> 02:19:57.010]  When will it collapse if it does, and how will it collapse?
[02:19:57.010 --> 02:19:58.772]  That's all coming up with Max Keiser.
[02:19:58.772 --> 02:20:00.194]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[02:20:01.869 --> 02:20:06.431]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:20:06.431 --> 02:20:10.753]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:20:10.753 --> 02:20:16.095]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:20:17.363 --> 02:20:22.947]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:20:22.947 --> 02:20:26.530]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:20:26.530 --> 02:20:31.254]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:20:31.254 --> 02:20:34.016]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:20:34.016 --> 02:20:38.500]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:20:38.500 --> 02:20:42.363]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:20:42.623 --> 02:20:47.668]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:20:47.668 --> 02:20:51.851]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:20:51.851 --> 02:20:53.633]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:20:53.633 --> 02:20:58.237]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:21:03.880 --> 02:21:06.341]  And you're subject to other police action.
[02:21:06.341 --> 02:21:07.602]  Tyranny is here.
[02:21:07.602 --> 02:21:11.544]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:21:11.544 --> 02:21:13.765]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:21:13.765 --> 02:21:19.627]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:21:19.627 --> 02:21:25.850]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:21:26.306 --> 02:21:32.273]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:21:32.273 --> 02:21:36.458]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:21:36.458 --> 02:21:40.763]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:21:40.763 --> 02:21:43.546]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies,
[02:21:43.966 --> 02:21:46.687]  Stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:21:46.687 --> 02:21:50.248]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:21:50.248 --> 02:21:52.209]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:21:52.209 --> 02:21:53.329]  It's here.

[02:22:01.306 --> 02:22:11.334]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[02:22:11.334 --> 02:22:17.759]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[02:22:17.759 --> 02:22:26.606]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[02:22:26.986 --> 02:22:36.173]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[02:22:36.173 --> 02:22:40.776]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[02:22:40.776 --> 02:22:42.577]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:42.577 --> 02:22:45.079]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[02:22:45.359 --> 02:22:48.682]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[02:22:48.682 --> 02:22:52.866]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[02:22:52.866 --> 02:22:53.747]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[02:22:53.747 --> 02:22:54.128]  Again that's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:02.168 --> 02:23:02.928]  The problem.
[02:23:02.928 --> 02:23:05.489]  How do I cook food without power?
[02:23:05.489 --> 02:23:08.210]  How do I light my home with no electricity?
[02:23:08.210 --> 02:23:10.891]  How do I get emergency radio broadcasts?
[02:23:10.891 --> 02:23:13.392]  How can I make safe drinking water?
[02:23:13.392 --> 02:23:21.135]  When your power goes out, the solution for cooking, baking, home lighting, listening to the radio, and producing clean water is the Family Emergency Kit.
[02:23:21.235 --> 02:23:22.376]  From Karo Stove.
[02:23:22.376 --> 02:23:29.783]  Karo Stove has been in business for over 12 years with the largest selection of kerosene stoves and family preparedness supplies in the U.S.
[02:23:29.783 --> 02:23:35.508]  Now get the family emergency kit at kerostove.com for only $4.29 plus shipping.
[02:23:35.508 --> 02:23:37.730]  A savings of nearly $200.
[02:23:37.730 --> 02:23:39.391]  It's perfect for off-the-grid living.
[02:23:39.551 --> 02:23:42.474]  Call 888-395-1164 today.
[02:23:42.474 --> 02:23:51.625]  That's 888-395-1164 and ask about weekly specials or check the specials online each week at kerostove.com.
[02:23:51.625 --> 02:23:57.051]  Again, call 888-395-1164 or go to kerostove.com.
[02:23:57.051 --> 02:24:00.135]  KeroStove, for family emergency solutions.
[02:24:07.799 --> 02:24:10.784]  Max Keiser is our guest, MaxKeiser.com.
[02:24:10.784 --> 02:24:13.147]  Your call is coming up in the next segment.
[02:24:13.147 --> 02:24:23.202]  Max, I talked to one of my neighbors, I talked to other people that are somewhat successful in business in Austin, and they say, well, I'm not in the stock market, so I don't care what these big banks are doing.
[02:24:24.929 --> 02:24:41.352]  And I don't understand this yuppie, pre-programmed arrogance where you try to warn people that you know and they act like it's weak to even care or even be involved in society as long as they think they're doing okay.
[02:24:41.352 --> 02:24:43.453]  I mean, everyone is connected to the stock market.
[02:24:43.453 --> 02:24:45.013]  Everyone is connected to the currencies.
[02:24:45.013 --> 02:24:51.414]  Everyone is connected through taxes with these trillions of dollars of, quote, bailouts used for bonuses.
[02:24:51.414 --> 02:24:53.535]  I mean, what do you call that mindset
[02:24:54.275 --> 02:25:03.179]  Where people don't understand the incredible magnitude of what's happening in global markets right now and where this is leading us.
[02:25:03.179 --> 02:25:07.001]  Well, you can explain it in the following way.
[02:25:07.001 --> 02:25:19.787]  The average experience of the average American is masked to a large degree by the fact that most people in America are unaware of the benefits accrued to them.
[02:25:20.487 --> 02:25:23.628]  Because the world reserve currency is the U.S.
[02:25:23.628 --> 02:25:24.289]  dollar.
[02:25:24.289 --> 02:25:31.911]  So there is no radical currency risk that you see in other countries, and the currency collapses that you see in other countries.
[02:25:31.911 --> 02:25:38.514]  And it also means that things like gasoline are incredibly cheap in America relative to other countries.
[02:25:38.514 --> 02:25:46.117]  Now what is going to happen, what people on your show are talking about, and what I've been talking about, and what I see over here in Europe,
[02:25:46.757 --> 02:25:48.198]  We're good to go.
[02:26:04.990 --> 02:26:12.034]  Bank shenanigans, including paying state, local, federal, and world tax.
[02:26:12.034 --> 02:26:18.618]  Because of course, world currency, you need a global central bank who's going to charge a global tax.
[02:26:18.618 --> 02:26:20.980]  And then Americans will wake up and they'll say, oh my god,
[02:26:21.560 --> 02:26:33.283]  You know, it's happening right now because the special drawing rights that are being used right now as part of this huge reconfiguration of the European banking system and the trillion dollar that the U.S.
[02:26:33.283 --> 02:26:38.584]  gave Europe to unwind their banks' risky positions.
[02:26:38.584 --> 02:26:43.005]  Part of that is the introduction of another $300 billion in special drawing rights.
[02:26:43.005 --> 02:26:48.667]  So the special drawing rights are creeping into the global currency system.
[02:26:48.667 --> 02:26:50.067]  At some point, they will
[02:26:50.687 --> 02:26:57.870]  Be comparable to other major currencies in terms of the amount traded, and the scope, and the influence.
[02:26:57.870 --> 02:27:03.613]  And then you'll start to see things quoted in special drawing rights, and they'll normalize the special drawing right.
[02:27:03.613 --> 02:27:10.756]  And then it'll be announced that as part of Brenton Woods 2, they're going to reconfigure the global currency grid.
[02:27:10.756 --> 02:27:11.176]  The U.S.
[02:27:11.176 --> 02:27:15.177]  dollar will be devalued by 50%, like it was in the 30s.
[02:27:15.177 --> 02:27:17.658]  Gold will be upwardly valued to $5,000 or $10,000 an ounce.
[02:27:19.379 --> 02:27:20.000]  And they just expect...
[02:27:34.380 --> 02:27:34.640]  I think so.
[02:27:53.075 --> 02:28:00.844]  Now, as soon as that situation ends, as it is happening right now, you'll have this incredible, you know, shock.
[02:28:00.844 --> 02:28:04.728]  And then it'll be way, way, way too late to do anything about it.
[02:28:04.728 --> 02:28:07.431]  So, I can understand why people are in a coma.
[02:28:08.308 --> 02:28:11.992]  When it comes to understanding the position of the U.S.
[02:28:11.992 --> 02:28:24.444]  relative to the rest of the world, and I can also anticipate that when this thing finally makes the break, there's going to be an incredible gasp of horror that'll just go from coast to coast.
[02:28:24.444 --> 02:28:26.406]  There will be absolute shock.
[02:28:26.406 --> 02:28:27.947]  How did this happen?
[02:28:32.565 --> 02:28:38.509]  And the banks will say, the big mega banks will say, don't worry, we're going to save you again with SDRs.
[02:28:38.509 --> 02:28:59.561]  We're transcending national currencies and we'll just make up to the power of infinity whatever amount of fiat money we want and you're going to pay us taxes on the right to use this new global cashless society system and they'll just bypass the three global regional currencies that the Trilateral Commission talked about in the 1970s, correct?
[02:29:02.097 --> 02:29:04.438]  That is basically correct.
[02:29:04.438 --> 02:29:14.183]  In other words, with the introduction of the Special Drawing Right, they will have another way to add another layer to this global Ponzi scheme, where all of the U.S.
[02:29:14.183 --> 02:29:19.045]  dollar-denominated debts will be re-securitized.
[02:29:19.045 --> 02:29:21.807]  Most of the debt will be off the balance sheet.
[02:29:21.807 --> 02:29:28.370]  Some of it will be included in the new SDR, but the SDR will be loaded up with more debt than even the U.S.
[02:29:28.370 --> 02:29:30.271]  dollar, and the result will be
[02:29:30.911 --> 02:29:49.558]  This constant downward pressure from above where no wages ever go up, no savers ever get a return greater than .0001% on their savings, and you end up in this casino gulag state where the only way anyone can make any more money than... Stay there!
[02:29:49.558 --> 02:29:50.179]  Got a break!
[02:29:50.179 --> 02:29:51.479]  Stay there!
[02:29:51.479 --> 02:29:52.880]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.880 --> 02:29:55.401]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.401 --> 02:29:58.122]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.740 --> 02:30:08.742]  In March, Alex Jones announced that eFoodsDirect was putting together a high-volume, pre-production order of the new Quick Fix meals.
[02:30:08.742 --> 02:30:16.085]  By waiting for production and shipping of their orders, families were able to receive one free item for every three that they bought.
[02:30:16.085 --> 02:30:23.067]  Since the final shutdown of this buy three get one free program, we've had a lot of folks calling, disappointed that they missed the order deadline.
[02:30:23.067 --> 02:30:23.927]  Listen carefully.
[02:30:24.287 --> 02:30:34.016]  Starting immediately, eFoodsDirect.com will take pre-production orders for a buy three get one free program for one week ending May 14th at midnight.
[02:30:34.016 --> 02:30:38.259]  You will receive one free item for every three that you order of the selected products.
[02:30:38.259 --> 02:30:41.262]  These orders will begin shipping the first week of June.
[02:30:41.262 --> 02:30:45.465]  To order on the web, eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex or call 800-409-5633.
[02:30:45.465 --> 02:30:46.386]  That's eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.

[02:30:51.230 --> 02:30:52.871]  Again, that's efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[02:30:52.871 --> 02:30:52.911]  800-409-5633.
[02:31:00.615 --> 02:31:04.718]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[02:32:00.074 --> 02:32:02.436]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:32:02.436 --> 02:32:04.777]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:32:04.777 --> 02:32:07.979]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:32:07.979 --> 02:32:13.083]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:32:13.083 --> 02:32:17.286]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:32:17.586 --> 02:32:20.048]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:32:20.048 --> 02:32:22.829]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:32:22.829 --> 02:32:25.731]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:32:25.731 --> 02:32:33.336]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:32:33.689 --> 02:32:39.074]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:32:39.074 --> 02:32:41.397]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:32:41.397 --> 02:32:45.621]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:32:45.621 --> 02:32:46.682]  And I got news for you.
[02:32:46.682 --> 02:32:48.023]  You're everyone else.
[02:32:48.023 --> 02:32:49.524]  Invisible Empire.

[02:33:06.049 --> 02:33:13.093]  We're going back to Max Keiser with a few other questions I've got, and then I promise you, in probably five, six minutes, we're going to start going to your calls.
[02:33:13.093 --> 02:33:16.796]  Tom, Rachel, Steven, Ian, Steve, and others.
[02:33:16.796 --> 02:33:19.798]  Again, we're live on this Monday, 17th day of May 2010 edition.
[02:33:21.633 --> 02:33:27.434]  Before we go any further, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that have made today's radio broadcast possible.
[02:33:27.434 --> 02:33:29.054]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[02:33:29.054 --> 02:33:33.275]  He has a free handgun and five days of world-class firearms training waiting for you.
[02:33:33.275 --> 02:33:36.736]  It's not enough to just own guns, you've got to know how to use them, and this is the place to go.
[02:33:36.736 --> 02:33:44.317]  You're going to get five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute, secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[02:33:44.317 --> 02:33:49.858]  Plus, if you act fast, the Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:33:50.518 --> 02:33:52.321]  I believe now is the time to get trained and ready.
[02:33:52.321 --> 02:33:55.986]  There's no drill instructor or boot camp tough guy mentality.
[02:33:55.986 --> 02:33:57.148]  It's got all the training you need.
[02:33:57.148 --> 02:33:58.791]  Two day, four day, five day courses.
[02:33:58.791 --> 02:34:00.974]  Go to Front Sight, like the front of your rifle.
[02:34:00.974 --> 02:34:02.637]  FrontSight.com.
[02:34:02.637 --> 02:34:04.219]  FrontSight.com.
[02:34:05.436 --> 02:34:10.743]  Also, a lot of you are thinking about getting into solar power in your home or your workshop or for camping.
[02:34:10.743 --> 02:34:16.230]  This is a great unit we've been putting out through our sponsors, Solutions from Science, for three years.
[02:34:16.230 --> 02:34:17.492]  I've got nothing but rave reviews.
[02:34:17.492 --> 02:34:20.195]  It's a solar panel system, a control panel, the battery system.
[02:34:20.856 --> 02:34:22.017]  It'll run quite a bit in your house.
[02:34:22.017 --> 02:34:23.938]  You get a bunch of these to run your whole house.
[02:34:23.938 --> 02:34:27.301]  It's a great way to stick more than just your toe, but your foot in.
[02:34:27.301 --> 02:34:31.504]  And it's very affordable, very inexpensive compared to a lot of the systems we've seen.
[02:34:31.504 --> 02:34:34.646]  So you can simply go to MySolarBackup.com.
[02:34:34.646 --> 02:34:35.507]  That's one word.

[02:34:56.932 --> 02:35:03.315]  Invisible Empire, a new world order defined, filmed by Jason Burmess, we put out in the last month.
[02:35:03.315 --> 02:35:05.455]  Very, very important material to wake people up.
[02:35:05.455 --> 02:35:08.337]  Folks are waking up, but they don't have all the info.
[02:35:08.337 --> 02:35:09.777]  These films will give it to them.
[02:35:09.777 --> 02:35:19.461]  And of course, Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic, that I'm in, that Gary Franchi coming up next hour, maybe William Lewis, gets into Tenth Amendment, states' rights, grand juries, Second Amendment,
[02:35:20.081 --> 02:35:22.862]  How to get your sheriff selected to take your counties back.
[02:35:22.862 --> 02:35:24.122]  Now shipping out.
[02:35:24.122 --> 02:35:24.943]  Don't tread on me.

[02:35:30.204 --> 02:35:34.586]  Okay, going back to Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com.
[02:35:34.586 --> 02:35:40.768]  Quickly, you basically answered my next question in the last segment, but in layman's simple terms.
[02:35:41.468 --> 02:35:42.129]  Yeah.
[02:35:42.129 --> 02:35:45.171]  Do you see Asia plunging next or how far will Europe plunge?
[02:35:45.171 --> 02:35:46.892]  Do you think the Eurozone is going to break up?
[02:35:46.892 --> 02:35:57.619]  The Germans are saying that major German newspapers are calling for a Deutsch Reich zone that only has the richest countries in Europe that are part of it.
[02:35:57.619 --> 02:36:00.461]  So what do you see happening with the Euro?
[02:36:00.461 --> 02:36:03.843]  I mean, I know you can't guess this exactly, but you've been very accurate in the past.
[02:36:03.843 --> 02:36:05.324]  How do you see this unfolding?
[02:36:05.324 --> 02:36:07.525]  Who do you see going down next?
[02:36:07.525 --> 02:36:10.007]  When does this really start to hit the U.S.? ?
[02:36:11.847 --> 02:36:12.348]  Right.
[02:36:12.348 --> 02:36:20.255]  Well, as you say, I've been pretty good at framing this and predicting this.
[02:36:20.255 --> 02:36:26.501]  What you have to understand is he's got a multi-trillion dollar hedge fund business.
[02:36:26.501 --> 02:36:36.210]  A hedge fund is just a fund that is not bound by any restrictions in terms of the types of bets that they can make and the leverage that they have at their disposal.
[02:36:36.930 --> 02:36:38.411]  Availability.
[02:36:38.411 --> 02:36:45.855]  And what they do is they go from currency to currency, and they ferret out which ones are the weakest.
[02:36:45.855 --> 02:36:48.617]  They then scare the bejesus out of the folks.
[02:36:48.617 --> 02:36:51.838]  They float rumors about the economic collapse.
[02:36:51.838 --> 02:36:53.079]  They crash the economy.
[02:36:53.079 --> 02:36:57.842]  They make a quick $100 billion or so, and then they move on.
[02:36:57.842 --> 02:36:59.823]  And from the Eurozone,
[02:37:00.855 --> 02:37:05.677]  I think that they've beat up the Euro pretty good here in the last few weeks.
[02:37:05.677 --> 02:37:08.518]  I think the next stop is the British Pound.
[02:37:08.518 --> 02:37:11.239]  The British Pound, they've got a new government in Britain.
[02:37:11.239 --> 02:37:13.860]  They're trying to bring in some reforms.
[02:37:13.860 --> 02:37:16.481]  They're talking about bringing in banking reform.
[02:37:16.481 --> 02:37:24.364]  So I think that next time we talk, we'll be talking about the tragic fall of the British Pound.
[02:37:24.364 --> 02:37:25.645]  They'll beat that up for a while.
[02:37:26.913 --> 02:37:34.540]  And then they either will go back to Eurozone and attack the Euro, or they may, you know, come back to the U.S.
[02:37:34.540 --> 02:37:35.481]  because the U.S.
[02:37:35.481 --> 02:37:38.883]  is always the currency that these guys know best.
[02:37:38.883 --> 02:37:45.569]  They know how to crash it in the most efficient manner, and it's always in their pocket.
[02:37:45.569 --> 02:37:47.210]  They can always crash the dollar.
[02:37:47.210 --> 02:37:51.254]  That's something they can always do for a quick buck, but you can't do it 100% of the time.
[02:37:51.254 --> 02:37:54.777]  You've got to take turns crashing different currencies at different times.
[02:37:55.177 --> 02:38:00.483]  So I think, the way I see it, the next is the British Pound.
[02:38:00.483 --> 02:38:05.949]  The Japanese Yen is kind of a possibility at some point.
[02:38:05.949 --> 02:38:11.976]  Their economy has gone now 20 straight years of deflation, and it's still highly problematic.
[02:38:12.496 --> 02:38:15.858]  They import something like, you know, 100% of their energy.
[02:38:15.858 --> 02:38:21.161]  So it's really at the mercies of the global economic system.
[02:38:21.161 --> 02:38:24.602]  So that's always a nice one to go in there occasionally.
[02:38:24.602 --> 02:38:28.144]  But they use really the yen, really what's called a funding currency.
[02:38:28.144 --> 02:38:29.165]  In other words, they borrow.
[02:38:30.015 --> 02:38:31.956]  In yen, because it's so cheap.
[02:38:31.956 --> 02:38:36.457]  And they use that to go attack a country like the UK or the Eurozone.
[02:38:36.457 --> 02:38:39.519]  So it depends on which country has a really weak currency.
[02:38:39.519 --> 02:38:42.540]  They use that to borrow and they go attack another currency.
[02:38:42.540 --> 02:38:43.480]  When I was in Reykjavik...
[02:38:44.575 --> 02:39:01.549]  Right before that economy collapsed, I sat in the 101 Hotel in the Sushi Bar, and I talked to some bankers from Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, and they said, look, in about six months, we're going to attack Iceland, and we're going to crash the Icelandic Krona.
[02:39:02.189 --> 02:39:07.014]  And they weren't shy about talking about it, and this is exactly what they did.
[02:39:07.014 --> 02:39:15.942]  Now, a few years later, they're finally getting around to putting some people in jail for counterfeiting and securities fraud and all kinds of other crimes.
[02:39:15.942 --> 02:39:22.308]  And hopefully they'll put somebody in jail to sit next to Bernie Madoff, and hopefully Lloyd Blankfein will be there shortly.
[02:39:24.358 --> 02:39:32.641]  And if we just continue to point out the Emperor's butt naked and isn't wearing any golden outfit, like the little three-year-old in the Emperor's New Clothes parable.
[02:39:32.641 --> 02:39:35.421]  In fact, guys, print me the Emperor's New Clothes parable.
[02:39:35.421 --> 02:39:37.142]  I want to read that next hour on air.
[02:39:37.142 --> 02:39:39.883]  If we just point out the obvious, it's going to implode.
[02:39:39.883 --> 02:39:46.965]  Max, did you see Fox News, the New York Times, AFP, Reuters in the last month all come out with a psy-op and say,
[02:39:47.865 --> 02:39:53.273]  Yes, the troops are helping grow the opium, because if we don't grow it, Al-Qaeda will get the money.
[02:39:53.273 --> 02:40:03.867]  I mean, this had been coming out that our government was there for the opium, $500 billion a year, and shipping it in, and the Russians had said this, but now they're so arrogant they hide it in plain view.
[02:40:03.867 --> 02:40:04.228]  It's like,
[02:40:05.387 --> 02:40:11.895]  It'd be like President Obama being naked at the podium and saying he wasn't naked, and we're not supposed to point out he's naked.
[02:40:11.895 --> 02:40:17.201]  So it's some kind of mind control thing where they just come out and say, yeah, we grow the opium.
[02:40:17.201 --> 02:40:20.085]  Have you ever talked to Catherine Austin Fitz about this?
[02:40:20.085 --> 02:40:20.966]  Yeah, the big red button.
[02:40:22.170 --> 02:40:33.977]  She's got an excellent, a lot of work on the CIA, Afghani opium crops, and also, you know, a lot of these hedge funds that you read about, this came out during the savings and loan collapse.
[02:40:33.977 --> 02:40:39.860]  They discovered that many of the hedge funds were actually backed by the government and CIA and other organizations.
[02:40:41.741 --> 02:40:52.607]  Back in the 2008 crash, when Hank Paulson put the gun to Congress's head and said, give us $700 billion or we're going to crash the economy, a lot of people in Congress were actually short bank stocks.
[02:40:52.607 --> 02:40:57.270]  They used an exchange-traded fund, which was making negative bets against bank stocks.
[02:40:57.270 --> 02:41:01.452]  So those congressmen were actually making money as those bank stocks were collapsing.
[02:41:02.132 --> 02:41:07.074]  So these guys are just fully invested in the collapse, and that's why I call them suicide bankers.
[02:41:07.074 --> 02:41:19.118]  Because they have a fundamentalist belief in capitalism as their religion, and they're willing to blow themselves up in the name of their religious belief and fanatical capitalism.
[02:41:19.118 --> 02:41:27.742]  Today, before I forget, Meredith Whitney, who's a very popular analyst now, she's the one who called out Citibank a few years ago, right before the crash.
[02:41:27.742 --> 02:41:30.983]  She said this, quote, financial reform
[02:41:31.932 --> 02:41:38.377]  Will cause, quote, tragic unemployment levels for an extended period of time.
[02:41:38.377 --> 02:41:41.060]  You see what she's saying?
[02:41:41.060 --> 02:41:47.765]  If you try to reform us, then unemployment levels will be tragic for an extended period of time.
[02:41:47.765 --> 02:41:49.326]  That's an outright threat!
[02:41:49.326 --> 02:41:51.949]  That's just an outright threat coming from Wall Street.
[02:41:51.949 --> 02:41:55.091]  If you try to reform us, you're never gonna get a job again.
[02:41:55.091 --> 02:41:59.515]  You know, that's just outright tyranny, I mean, what else can you call it?
[02:42:00.370 --> 02:42:01.891]  You're absolutely right.
[02:42:01.891 --> 02:42:04.792]  Well said, Max Keiser, and they just continue to threaten.
[02:42:04.792 --> 02:42:06.272]  Let's talk to Tom in Connecticut.
[02:42:06.272 --> 02:42:09.014]  You're on the air.
[02:42:09.014 --> 02:42:11.455]  Hi, yeah, this is perfect what you're talking about.
[02:42:11.455 --> 02:42:26.481]  I did want to comment on something you said yesterday, Alex, and that was you said it was good that they were arresting the bankers in Iceland, but then you said it's okay, you know, we have the great local bankers down the street where you can get a loan for a car.
[02:42:27.128 --> 02:42:32.715]  But a private banker is a private banker is a private banker no matter how small they are, how big they are.
[02:42:32.715 --> 02:42:37.982]  They have the power through factional reserve lending to create money out of nothing.
[02:42:37.982 --> 02:42:41.447]  And what we need is public credit.
[02:42:41.912 --> 02:42:43.572]  Directly through our government.
[02:42:43.572 --> 02:42:45.893]  We need to take the responsibility.
[02:42:45.893 --> 02:42:46.933]  Well, let me say this.
[02:42:46.933 --> 02:42:49.014]  I mean, I'm all for state banks.
[02:42:49.014 --> 02:42:50.635]  But that's still a bank.
[02:42:50.635 --> 02:42:54.156]  And it's not going to be able to compete if it doesn't have the fractional system.
[02:42:54.156 --> 02:42:56.316]  And this is a very complex issue.
[02:42:56.316 --> 02:42:58.817]  But local banks, some are good, some are bad.
[02:42:58.817 --> 02:43:06.319]  The point is, we don't want the mega six banks in the U.S., several others globally, but there's no more than ten, any way you slice it.
[02:43:06.319 --> 02:43:09.340]  So just for simplicity, we don't want the mega ten banks.
[02:43:10.020 --> 02:43:15.083]  To have the regulatory power to scoop up the smaller banks, because then we're really in trouble.
[02:43:15.083 --> 02:43:17.064]  Max Keiser.
[02:43:17.064 --> 02:43:26.389]  In North Dakota, they have a banking system which is sound, because they passed some laws to get rid of a lot of the abuses.
[02:43:26.389 --> 02:43:30.692]  And Ellen Brown, who's a very fine journalist, has done a lot of work.
[02:43:30.692 --> 02:43:34.774]  If you type in Ellen Brown in the search engine, and search North Dakota banks,
[02:43:35.594 --> 02:43:53.972]  It is possible to run banks in an equitable, fair way, and North Dakota, surprisingly, people probably don't know about this, they actually have some pretty decent banks because they have decided to not try to run with the wolves and to simply get in the very simple business of
[02:43:54.420 --> 02:43:56.502]  But it's the same thing with Texas banks.
[02:43:56.502 --> 02:43:58.644]  They're some of the wealthiest in the country.
[02:43:58.644 --> 02:44:05.871]  And the Texas Banking Association has come out and said, we're not selling derivatives, we're not the big mega banks, they are dangerous.
[02:44:05.871 --> 02:44:13.058]  And so that's important to be friendly with regional banks to be able to defeat the big banks.
[02:44:13.058 --> 02:44:18.083]  And then later if we want to change something at that level and fix abuses at the local level, I think it's great.
[02:44:18.083 --> 02:44:18.984]  But Tom, finish your point.
[02:44:19.949 --> 02:44:26.294]  Yeah, well, that is excellent that Max brought up Ellen Brown in her book, The Web of Debt, in the Bank of North Dakota.
[02:44:26.294 --> 02:44:29.677]  No, the Bank of North Dakota is a state-owned and operated bank.
[02:44:29.677 --> 02:44:31.938]  It is true sovereign money.
[02:44:31.938 --> 02:44:39.284]  We need a sovereign monetary system, not a private debt money system, what we have now, where they have the power to create money.
[02:44:39.284 --> 02:44:40.705]  They are like a mafia.
[02:44:40.705 --> 02:44:46.470]  We have to realize that the private bankers of the world are like a global mafia, and we have to stand up to them.
[02:44:46.770 --> 02:44:50.312]  Like, the people of a village stand up to the mafia and run them out of town.
[02:44:50.312 --> 02:44:50.872]  I agree.
[02:44:50.872 --> 02:44:52.212]  Tom, well said.
[02:44:52.212 --> 02:44:53.233]  Absolutely.
[02:44:53.233 --> 02:44:58.275]  Currency should be a symbol of exchange, not the actual energy.
[02:44:58.275 --> 02:44:59.435]  It doesn't have the value.
[02:44:59.435 --> 02:45:02.537]  It's an agreed upon mode of exchange.
[02:45:02.537 --> 02:45:05.258]  And we need to get back to what we had pre-1913.
[02:45:05.258 --> 02:45:07.559]  Let's talk to Rachel in New York.
[02:45:07.559 --> 02:45:08.199]  You're on the air.
[02:45:08.199 --> 02:45:11.080]  Hi.
[02:45:11.080 --> 02:45:14.362]  I just wanted to let you know that one of the things that has been going on lately
[02:45:14.955 --> 02:45:21.201]  That is not being reported is that many people up here in New York on Wall Street are withdrawing their 401k's.
[02:45:23.599 --> 02:45:26.580]  Actually, I have seen that in the news.
[02:45:26.580 --> 02:45:37.684]  The word is getting out, but it's not a big national story because of Bloomberg and other reports that the federal government is ordering private pension funds to, quote, invest in failed banks.
[02:45:37.684 --> 02:45:43.066]  I mean, since when can the government order because they have regulatory threats if they don't?
[02:45:43.066 --> 02:45:45.026]  See, they can selectively enforce.
[02:45:45.026 --> 02:45:46.207]  Max Keiser, break that down.
[02:45:47.322 --> 02:45:47.582]  Right.
[02:45:47.582 --> 02:45:50.283]  Well, 401k accounts are the retirement accounts.
[02:45:50.283 --> 02:45:52.684]  People squirrel away money every month with their employer.
[02:45:52.684 --> 02:46:15.494]  Now, if they're liquidating those accounts, what's not being clear here is either it's because of duress and they need that money because they're going bankrupt and they have to draw down their savings, or two, they fear tax hikes coming and the tax advantages of the 401k evaporate, so why not take that money out and put it somewhere in another institution that you don't have the same kind of risk?
[02:46:15.934 --> 02:46:39.094]  Now, I think what the caller is referring to is that people are removing money from the 401k as an offensive measure, not a defensive measure, as a way to understand that they need to take more control of their financial well-being and to put what they thought was money safely put away into other alternative investments, possibly other currencies, other countries, into gold, etc.
[02:46:40.782 --> 02:46:42.523]  Well said, Max Keiser.
[02:46:42.523 --> 02:46:44.283]  Anything else, Rachel?
[02:46:44.283 --> 02:46:44.783]  No, that's all.
[02:46:44.783 --> 02:46:52.926]  I just wanted to say many of the people we're speaking to say they'd rather have their money now than wait until they're 58 years old when it won't be there anymore.
[02:46:52.926 --> 02:46:54.967]  They'll take the tax hit now.
[02:46:54.967 --> 02:46:55.347]  Yeah, I know.
[02:46:55.347 --> 02:46:56.327]  That's accelerating.
[02:46:56.327 --> 02:46:57.207]  Good point.
[02:46:57.207 --> 02:47:00.428]  Let's talk to Steven in California.
[02:47:00.428 --> 02:47:01.029]  You're on the air.
[02:47:01.029 --> 02:47:02.989]  Mr. Jones?
[02:47:02.989 --> 02:47:04.710]  Yes, sir.
[02:47:04.710 --> 02:47:05.590]  Pleasure to be on your show.
[02:47:05.590 --> 02:47:08.051]  I'm a first-time caller and kind of a first-time listener.
[02:47:09.688 --> 02:47:18.557]  As a young person living in today, I become educated on your show and you instill the passion slash interest in government.
[02:47:18.557 --> 02:47:25.584]  And I was wondering, you know, how a person in my position, my family has no legacy and all that, how do I get into that sort of thing?
[02:47:25.584 --> 02:47:30.749]  Well, look, in high school, in college, they make it boring, it's government, it's like
[02:47:32.862 --> 02:47:37.085]  Alcatraz or something, or it's like some, you know, island of Dr. Maru.
[02:47:37.085 --> 02:47:39.728]  It's some imaginary thing far off.
[02:47:39.728 --> 02:47:50.496]  You've got to be involved in government, because if you don't, it's going to get taken over by shysters, and they're going to rob the hell out of you, and hire a bunch of uniformed thugs to enforce their corruption.
[02:47:50.496 --> 02:47:51.297]  It's called tyranny.
[02:47:51.897 --> 02:48:01.824]  And so we've became the wealthiest country in the world because we had a small government and we were on top of things and we allowed people to keep most their wealth because it was their God-given right.
[02:48:01.824 --> 02:48:15.053]  Now we're becoming the center of evil because our wealth has been used to dominate the globe and build an empire and no one is as enslaved as people inside the empire and so people are waking up and deciding I better get involved in government.
[02:48:15.053 --> 02:48:17.355]  Then they go get involved in government and they find
[02:48:18.095 --> 02:48:23.780]  That for those that did get involved, there's a fake left-right choice, which is meant to further confuse them.
[02:48:23.780 --> 02:48:25.141]  Okay?
[02:48:25.141 --> 02:48:38.833]  They've followed the yellow brick road, they've gotten to the Emerald Palace, they've gone in, and there's this big flaming head telling them, I am the Great Oz, and the next level is going, no Republicans and Democrats, you're not.
[02:48:40.094 --> 02:48:44.621]  Pulls the curtain back or the two-year-old points out the emperor has no clothes.
[02:48:44.621 --> 02:48:45.703]  Same analogy.
[02:48:45.703 --> 02:48:46.424]  Same archetype.
[02:48:46.424 --> 02:48:51.772]  You pull it back and it's a pot-bellied little demon goblin back there that's scared to death of you.
[02:48:51.772 --> 02:48:55.177]  If we don't pull back the curtain and arrest the goblin, it's over.
[02:48:55.177 --> 02:48:55.718]  Max Keiser.
[02:48:57.199 --> 02:49:05.265]  Well, if you go back, this is a very interesting question, because it's a very interesting inflection point, and especially for a young person.
[02:49:05.265 --> 02:49:12.010]  Now, if you remember, Ronald Reagan said, government is the problem.
[02:49:12.010 --> 02:49:18.595]  And he said this under the influence of thinkers like Milton Friedman, who believed that the market could solve all problems.
[02:49:18.595 --> 02:49:26.020]  Now in 2010, people are saying, you know what, the market is actually the problem, and it's creating an incredible amount of problems.
[02:49:26.460 --> 02:49:28.602]  But here's the next problem, Max, let me comment.
[02:49:49.400 --> 02:49:58.627]  No, I agree with you, but again, to expand on that, under the Constitution, Congress controls the issuance of currency and credit, not private bankers.
[02:49:58.627 --> 02:50:00.889]  So the confusion is going to be with the public.
[02:50:00.889 --> 02:50:08.475]  You're going to have the private bankers pose as a solution with a type of regulation that is only going to empower them even more.
[02:50:08.475 --> 02:50:09.816]  So, how do you get past that?
[02:50:10.276 --> 02:50:20.704]  Well, that's... First, so my question is, there's a lot of rhetoric, and especially in the libertarian camp, that government has nothing to offer.
[02:50:20.704 --> 02:50:24.486]  And, you know, I think that that is a self-defeating position.
[02:50:24.486 --> 02:50:27.969]  There has to be some role of government, first of all.
[02:50:27.969 --> 02:50:31.211]  So, government, therefore, does not become a dirty word.
[02:50:31.211 --> 02:50:32.812]  There is a role for government.
[02:50:32.812 --> 02:50:33.873]  That's step number one.
[02:50:33.873 --> 02:50:34.814]  Step number two is,
[02:50:35.374 --> 02:50:36.795]  If you suffer from poor sleep,
[02:51:03.024 --> 02:51:04.665]  You've gotta try MyPillow!

[02:52:06.967 --> 02:52:10.632]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:52:10.632 --> 02:52:13.115]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:52:13.115 --> 02:52:18.422]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.

[02:53:12.039 --> 02:53:12.919]  Remember?
[02:53:12.919 --> 02:53:14.980]  There's a place down in Tennessee

[02:53:50.984 --> 02:53:51.344]  Others don't.
[02:54:04.154 --> 02:54:06.416]  What if I say I'm not like the others?
[02:54:06.416 --> 02:54:09.638]  What if I say I'm not one of your slaves?
[02:54:09.638 --> 02:54:14.162]  What if I say I will never surrender?
[02:54:14.162 --> 02:54:15.423]  What if I say I'm not like the others?
[02:54:23.575 --> 02:54:25.859]  Miss Oklahoma talking about Arizona.
[02:54:25.859 --> 02:54:27.322]  Says she supports Arizona law.
[02:54:27.322 --> 02:54:29.988]  We're going to talk about states' rights coming up.
[02:54:31.124 --> 02:54:37.066]  But before I go any further with Max Keiser, I want to simplify this, because this gets confusing for people, because it is so simple.
[02:54:37.066 --> 02:54:39.167]  Sometimes the simplest things are confusing.
[02:54:39.167 --> 02:54:50.672]  I'm against anything big and monolithic, whether it's government or hedge funds that are bigger than any government, money-wise, because they just created themselves, as Thomas Jefferson warned they would, a blank check to take over the planet.
[02:54:50.672 --> 02:54:59.756]  Now, to paraphrase Jefferson, he said, you know, you could take out private central bankers, but if you ever let them back in, within one day, they'll buy up the whole world with fake credit they produce.
[02:54:59.756 --> 02:54:59.916]  So,
[02:55:00.896 --> 02:55:13.024]  The problem is with a quote free market is it's not free market when the CIA with a inner coterie of private banks gives themselves unlimited trillions and uses their own regulatory power to shut down their competition.
[02:55:13.024 --> 02:55:20.788]  And so we need government to protect the true free market and to have rules against counterfeiting as Max Keiser said.
[02:55:20.788 --> 02:55:22.149]  Counterfeiting is illegal.
[02:55:22.149 --> 02:55:28.093]  If I opened up a fake company, started selling stock, claiming it was in gold mines I didn't own, it would be a fraud.
[02:55:28.533 --> 02:55:38.122]  Well, it's a step past that, with the fractional reserve banking, with the derivatives, with these fake insurance companies certifying it, and then taxpayers having to bail it out.
[02:55:38.122 --> 02:55:39.983]  So, that is the issue.
[02:55:39.983 --> 02:55:46.389]  The, quote, free market's being demonized by the bankers themselves, because they want a global controlled market that they control.
[02:55:46.389 --> 02:55:49.191]  And so, it's... until the public becomes educated on this...
[02:55:50.032 --> 02:55:51.253]  It's just going to get worse.
[02:55:51.253 --> 02:55:53.496]  Again, MaxKaiser.com is his website.
[02:55:53.496 --> 02:55:54.417]  Very informative stuff.
[02:55:54.417 --> 02:55:57.780]  You can watch him on RT, as well as PressTV.
[02:55:57.780 --> 02:56:03.086]  He does weekly television shows that are some of the most popular on those channels.
[02:56:03.086 --> 02:56:06.910]  But let's go back to your phone calls.
[02:56:06.910 --> 02:56:08.592]  Briefly answering Steve's question.
[02:56:08.592 --> 02:56:10.574]  Steven, I don't know how you get involved, quote, in government.
[02:56:10.794 --> 02:56:17.759]  start fighting tyranny form your own group go to city council speak out start a blog and you'll learn and get better as you go.
[02:56:17.759 --> 02:56:23.104]  Ian in England you're on the air with questions for Max Keiser.
[02:56:23.104 --> 02:56:24.264]  Hi there.
[02:56:24.264 --> 02:56:27.987]  Hello all beyond this is Airstrip 2 calling over go ahead.
[02:56:27.987 --> 02:56:30.749]  How are you doing Alex?
[02:56:30.749 --> 02:56:32.491]  Good.
[02:56:32.491 --> 02:56:33.531]  Good to be on.
[02:56:33.531 --> 02:56:35.573]  It's good to hear Max Keiser.
[02:56:35.573 --> 02:56:36.093]  I've always been
[02:56:37.567 --> 02:56:41.889]  An interested listener to his opinions, and of course, your own.
[02:56:41.889 --> 02:56:55.253]  With regards to the British parliamentary catastrophe that's been going on, I mean, people think that they can't make a difference, but we've demonstrated that we've effectively created a constitutional crisis here.
[02:56:55.253 --> 02:57:00.535]  There was nobody who was willing to back up the parliamentary process.
[02:57:00.535 --> 02:57:06.137]  And I think that that's certainly a statement which people can take a little bit of pleasure from, if not
[02:57:06.943 --> 02:57:09.766]  That's right, all three of the big parties are hated.
[02:57:09.766 --> 02:57:11.868]  Your take on what's happening in England, Max?
[02:57:21.906 --> 02:57:22.687]  Yeah, they did.
[02:57:22.687 --> 02:57:27.832]  They triggered a crisis, a constitutional crisis, as your caller calls it.
[02:57:27.832 --> 02:57:42.125]  And because in the UK, they've become very adept at strategic voting, so everybody on the web kind of shares information to try to swing the local elections in a strategic way.
[02:57:42.125 --> 02:57:46.549]  So they might vote for somebody they don't really want, if it's strategic, toward a bigger goal.
[02:57:47.209 --> 02:57:49.490]  And the people have really organized themselves in this way.
[02:57:49.490 --> 02:57:59.453]  Now it's interesting, when the new coalition started, this Tory-Liberal-Democrat coalition, it was very interesting because they were the coalition government, they didn't have a majority.
[02:57:59.453 --> 02:58:05.355]  They had a problem because in the House of Lords they didn't have enough Lords to back up their proposals.
[02:58:05.355 --> 02:58:12.177]  So what they did yesterday is they simply, with a stroke of a pen, increased the number of Lords in the House of Lords by 100.
[02:58:13.417 --> 02:58:17.498]  Now, for anyone in the U.S., that would send a chill down your spine.
[02:58:17.498 --> 02:58:24.921]  Because, of course, we fought a war to get rid of it, to escape the Lords in the House of Lords.
[02:58:24.921 --> 02:58:29.002]  But they're still active, and they're still part of a major government, the U.S.
[02:58:29.002 --> 02:58:29.442]  ally.
[02:58:29.442 --> 02:58:34.904]  That's why the Bank of England was established in 1694, which is... Plus, they're not hereditary Lords.
[02:58:34.904 --> 02:58:35.784]  They're not hereditary.
[02:58:35.784 --> 02:58:37.484]  Five more minutes with Max Keiser.
[02:58:37.484 --> 02:58:38.605]  Trade ahead, more of your calls.

[02:59:15.064 --> 02:59:21.591]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[02:59:21.591 --> 02:59:24.533]  Buy American and stay clean, as well as support InfoWars.

[02:59:54.131 --> 02:59:56.492]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.492 --> 02:59:59.293]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:12.494 --> 03:00:19.025]  Max Keiser is our guest for another five minutes.
[03:00:20.345 --> 03:00:26.007]  And we see the French government in trouble, the German government, the Greek government, the Icelandic government, the British government.
[03:00:26.007 --> 03:00:28.927]  The people are saying no to the banking dictatorship.
[03:00:28.927 --> 03:00:35.889]  There is a global rebellion, insurrection against the New World Order right as it's being born.
[03:00:35.889 --> 03:00:38.370]  As I've always said, dead on arrival.
[03:00:38.370 --> 03:00:43.351]  A few final calls for Max Keiser and Gary Franchi coming up.
[03:00:43.351 --> 03:00:48.533]  Who is up next here on my phone list, John?
[03:00:48.533 --> 03:00:48.653]  Who?
[03:00:50.290 --> 03:00:51.170]  Okay, good.
[03:00:51.170 --> 03:00:53.711]  Stephen New York, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:00:53.711 --> 03:00:54.811]  Hello Alex, how are you?
[03:00:54.811 --> 03:00:55.671]  Good, sir.
[03:00:55.671 --> 03:00:56.992]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:00:56.992 --> 03:01:03.513]  I'm really glad you made reference to Thomas Jefferson a few minutes ago, because my question has to do with two of our root problems.
[03:01:03.513 --> 03:01:12.695]  One of them is the dictatorship of the Federal Reserve, and the other happens to be the way we're decentralized and we don't have a common ground to make our voices heard.
[03:01:12.695 --> 03:01:19.777]  What if we drafted a new Declaration of Independence against the Federal Reserve, and we're able to be cosigners to it on Infowars.com?
[03:01:20.390 --> 03:01:25.513]  Given the fact that you have millions of listeners, what if we let our voices and our numbers be heard?
[03:01:25.513 --> 03:01:43.862]  Well, I think you think too much of me, but I am for, say, getting 15, 20 states who've got true anti-New World Order patriots in it, and then having a real constitutional convention with men of great gravitas and others there, and have it all televised, and then have them meet for a few months.
[03:01:44.162 --> 03:01:47.825]  So the public could, you know, chime in almost like American Idol.
[03:01:47.825 --> 03:01:52.749]  Imagine the ratings this would get, you know, like to say what they wanted inside the Declaration of Independence.
[03:01:52.749 --> 03:02:00.935]  Of course, swearing allegiance to the previous system, but recodifying our independence against not King George III, but the banking cartel.
[03:02:00.935 --> 03:02:08.641]  It'd be a great illustration and give an avenue of resistance and a focal point.
[03:02:08.641 --> 03:02:09.182]  Max Keiser.
[03:02:10.014 --> 03:02:11.434]  Well, I have a slightly different opinion.
[03:02:11.434 --> 03:02:18.376]  I mean, because this is basically a global problem, I think the Americans should approach it in that way.
[03:02:18.376 --> 03:02:35.160]  And for the caller that just called in, what I would think to do is to contact the people in Iceland and to contact the people in Greece and tell them you're behind them and that we have support in the global... I totally agree, Max, but if the New World Order falls here, it falls forever.
[03:02:36.874 --> 03:02:38.676]  This is like Leningrad!
[03:02:38.676 --> 03:02:39.978]  This is like Leningrad!
[03:02:39.978 --> 03:02:40.859]  Let me tell you something.
[03:02:40.859 --> 03:02:45.885]  Basically, you've already got some momentum going on right now.
[03:02:45.885 --> 03:02:47.967]  So, it'll come to the U.S.
[03:02:47.967 --> 03:02:52.313]  when it comes to the U.S., but in the meantime, you've got Iceland and Greece are now joining.
[03:02:52.313 --> 03:02:53.995]  They're creating a new joint flag.
[03:02:53.995 --> 03:02:54.755]  The war is now.
[03:02:55.754 --> 03:02:56.774]  It's happening right now.
[03:02:56.774 --> 03:03:02.717]  So people, you know, during the... Remember, Hemingway went to fight in Europe during the war.
[03:03:02.717 --> 03:03:03.877]  For whom the bell tolls.
[03:03:03.877 --> 03:03:04.637]  Just re-read it.
[03:03:04.637 --> 03:03:07.158]  Going to other places to fight wars abroad.
[03:03:07.158 --> 03:03:09.679]  Because they believe in a certain way that things should be done.
[03:03:09.679 --> 03:03:11.960]  Now, there's a war going on right now in Greece.
[03:03:11.960 --> 03:03:17.062]  The Americans should be helping the Greeks fight the tyranny in Greece.
[03:03:17.062 --> 03:03:21.104]  That's the responsibility of every freedom-loving American.
[03:03:21.104 --> 03:03:21.664]  I agree with you.
[03:03:21.664 --> 03:03:23.345]  I just re-read for whom the bell tolls.
[03:03:24.645 --> 03:03:28.168]  As he lays there at the end with his heart beating against the pine needles.
[03:03:28.168 --> 03:03:29.589]  What a powerful book.
[03:03:29.589 --> 03:03:32.451]  Okay, well, the man is a man of principle.
[03:03:32.451 --> 03:03:36.654]  And where there's people out there who are, you know, that's what the U.S.
[03:03:36.654 --> 03:03:37.494]  used to stand for.
[03:03:37.494 --> 03:03:38.855]  Wherever there's tyranny, the U.S.
[03:03:38.855 --> 03:03:39.856]  went to put out the fire.
[03:03:39.856 --> 03:03:44.659]  Then along the way came, you know, the banking nightmare that we now know.
[03:03:44.659 --> 03:03:49.663]  But those people in Greece, the people in Iceland, the people in Portugal, the people in Spain, they need support.
[03:03:49.663 --> 03:03:50.764]  And we can help support them.
[03:03:50.764 --> 03:03:51.704]  I'm already in Europe.
[03:03:51.704 --> 03:03:52.685]  I'm already supporting them.
[03:03:52.745 --> 03:04:00.567]  You know, my YouTube, which I did on Al Jazeera English, has been translated into Greek, and it has now 400,000 views.
[03:04:00.567 --> 03:04:01.207]  You've done well.
[03:04:01.207 --> 03:04:02.507]  I know, you're having a great effect.
[03:04:02.507 --> 03:04:03.227]  Well, it's out there now.
[03:04:03.227 --> 03:04:09.728]  The Greek government is saying the exact same thing that was said in that video, that they want to go investigate the fraud.
[03:04:09.728 --> 03:04:12.889]  They want to look at the issues of transparency.
[03:04:12.889 --> 03:04:16.910]  And through back channels, I can tell you that there's some communication going on.
[03:04:17.510 --> 03:04:18.770]  The revolution is happening.
[03:04:18.770 --> 03:04:19.351]  No, I know.
[03:04:19.351 --> 03:04:24.492]  I'm in communication with the Greeks as well, and we're all working together, and we commend you.
[03:04:24.492 --> 03:04:26.893]  I appreciate Steve's call.
[03:04:26.893 --> 03:04:31.914]  The point is, we're on the march, the empire is on the run, and we are out of time.
[03:04:31.914 --> 03:04:33.975]  What do you think about what's happening in Thailand?
[03:04:35.442 --> 03:04:36.663]  It's more of the same.
[03:04:36.663 --> 03:04:42.248]  You know, it's just a different flavor of the same ice cream store of fraud.
[03:04:42.248 --> 03:04:46.492]  And, you know, those folks are getting screwed just like the other folks in other countries.
[03:04:46.492 --> 03:04:48.594]  It's just a slightly different configuration.
[03:04:48.594 --> 03:04:50.076]  But the issues are the same.
[03:04:50.076 --> 03:04:52.618]  Those in power want to steal all the wealth.
[03:04:52.618 --> 03:04:56.602]  And the people who are workers and savers are getting... Alright, we're out of time.
[03:04:56.602 --> 03:04:57.803]  Max, talk to you again soon.
[03:04:57.803 --> 03:04:58.383]  God bless you.
[03:04:58.383 --> 03:04:59.404]  Alright, buddy.
[03:04:59.404 --> 03:04:59.885]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:01.138 --> 03:05:02.438]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:05:02.438 --> 03:05:08.020]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:05:08.020 --> 03:05:13.042]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:05:13.042 --> 03:05:18.084]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[03:05:18.624 --> 03:05:23.848]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:05:23.848 --> 03:05:26.149]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[03:05:26.149 --> 03:05:30.952]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:05:30.952 --> 03:05:32.073]  And here's the best part.
[03:05:32.073 --> 03:05:35.135]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[03:05:35.135 --> 03:05:38.778]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:05:38.778 --> 03:05:41.960]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:05:41.960 --> 03:05:44.181]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[03:05:48.744 --> 03:05:50.185]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:05:50.185 --> 03:05:57.810]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:05:57.810 --> 03:06:00.732]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:06:00.732 --> 03:06:08.737]  In March, Alex Jones announced that eFoods Direct was putting together a high-volume, pre-production order of the new Quick Fix meals.
[03:06:08.737 --> 03:06:15.762]  By waiting for production and shipping of their orders, families were able to receive one free item for every three that they bought.
[03:06:16.082 --> 03:06:23.064]  Since the final shutdown of this Buy 3 Get 1 Free program, we've had a lot of folks calling, disappointed that they missed the order deadline.
[03:06:23.064 --> 03:06:24.284]  Listen carefully.
[03:06:24.284 --> 03:06:34.006]  Starting immediately, eFoodsDirect.com will take pre-production orders for a Buy 3 Get 1 Free program for one week ending May 14th at midnight.
[03:06:34.006 --> 03:06:38.247]  You will receive one free item for every three that you order of the selected products.
[03:06:38.247 --> 03:06:41.248]  These orders will begin shipping the first week of June.
[03:06:41.248 --> 03:06:44.529]  To order on the web, eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex

[03:06:50.698 --> 03:06:50.738]  800-409-5633.
[03:07:00.472 --> 03:07:01.773]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:07:01.773 --> 03:07:07.376]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:07:07.376 --> 03:07:12.378]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:07:12.378 --> 03:07:12.858]  It's true.
[03:07:12.858 --> 03:07:17.421]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[03:07:17.961 --> 03:07:23.185]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:07:23.185 --> 03:07:30.289]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:07:30.289 --> 03:07:31.410]  And here's the best part.
[03:07:31.410 --> 03:07:38.115]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:07:38.115 --> 03:07:41.297]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[03:07:41.297 --> 03:07:44.439]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:07:48.161 --> 03:07:52.304]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:07:52.304 --> 03:07:57.147]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:07:57.147 --> 03:08:03.051]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:08:03.051 --> 03:08:09.696]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.696 --> 03:08:12.678]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:15.250 --> 03:08:28.579]  The big S-E-I-U-Obama Union that beats up Tea Party people and gets away with it has stormed the Bank of America, according to Business Insider and the Huffington Post.
[03:08:28.579 --> 03:08:32.802]  Bank of America protests, dozen storm bank branch in D.C.
[03:08:32.802 --> 03:08:35.924]  demanding bank re-regulation.
[03:08:35.924 --> 03:08:41.088]  But the bill was written by the big banks, just like the insurance companies wrote the insurance plan.
[03:08:41.088 --> 03:08:42.449]  And so you got Obama's people
[03:08:43.459 --> 03:08:57.002]  Preemptively stirring up a tax protest on banks, his hired henchmen, on record, commanded by the White House, are in there saying, let's get the banks!
[03:08:57.002 --> 03:08:58.843]  Federal Reserve Act of 1913!
[03:08:58.843 --> 03:08:59.703]  Same thing was done then.
[03:08:59.703 --> 03:09:01.043]  That'll get them!
[03:09:01.043 --> 03:09:02.404]  That'll teach them!
[03:09:02.404 --> 03:09:06.145]  Yeah, let them shut down all their competition that are local banks.
[03:09:07.352 --> 03:09:08.373]  We've gone over the bill here.
[03:09:08.373 --> 03:09:13.596]  It's been mainstream news that every transaction you make, everything in your account, live time, controlled by the feds.
[03:09:13.596 --> 03:09:15.797]  Oh, that's really good.
[03:09:15.797 --> 03:09:18.478]  That's another bait and switch by these people.
[03:09:18.478 --> 03:09:22.661]  And it's the same type of tricks over and over and over again.
[03:09:25.270 --> 03:09:26.931]  Why can't people get more sophisticated?
[03:09:26.931 --> 03:09:32.156]  I guess they are starting to get more sophisticated, but we don't have time for an education curve here, folks.
[03:09:32.156 --> 03:09:34.338]  This is crash course in brain surgery.
[03:09:34.338 --> 03:09:36.860]  And I know my general audience is smarter than I am in most respects.
[03:09:36.860 --> 03:09:38.481]  I'm not talking to my old listeners.
[03:09:38.481 --> 03:09:43.705]  I'm talking about new people tuning in and these idiots with these unions.
[03:09:43.705 --> 03:09:44.126]  Oh, God.
[03:09:46.983 --> 03:09:51.288]  I mean, it's like Grayson saying, we've defeated the Fed.
[03:09:51.288 --> 03:10:00.137]  Oh yeah, it's just taken over right now by changing Ron Paul's bill in the Senate and then telling people with Bernie Sanders that it's a defeat of the Federal Reserve.
[03:10:00.137 --> 03:10:00.497]  Bull!
[03:10:01.718 --> 03:10:04.299]  Goldman Sachs being investigated by the feds.
[03:10:04.299 --> 03:10:08.779]  It's almost completely Goldman Sachs that run all the federal regulatory agencies.
[03:10:08.779 --> 03:10:13.400]  They're going to burn some mid-level trailer on Timberwolf.
[03:10:13.400 --> 03:10:15.421]  They're giving the dog a bone, folks.
[03:10:15.421 --> 03:10:17.281]  They're giving the dog a bone.
[03:10:17.281 --> 03:10:18.821]  We're going to continue with your calls this hour.
[03:10:18.821 --> 03:10:24.303]  Webster Tarpley pops in for only five minutes with his inside take on what's happening in Thailand for the rest of the hour.
[03:10:24.303 --> 03:10:31.104]  We're joined by Gary Franchi on state's rights, on taking our counties and cities back, on having real sustainable local communities.
[03:10:31.784 --> 03:10:33.245]  We're good to go.
[03:10:51.232 --> 03:10:55.413]  Gary Franchi, of course, the Lone Lantern Society and Restore the Republic.
[03:10:55.413 --> 03:10:56.153]  He took that over.
[03:10:56.153 --> 03:11:02.995]  He was the second in command there when Aaron Russo died and the great work he was doing with his movement to end the Fed.
[03:11:02.995 --> 03:11:04.575]  Of course, America, Freedom to Fascism.
[03:11:04.575 --> 03:11:07.916]  He produced the film with William Lewis.
[03:11:07.916 --> 03:11:14.458]  And we are honored to have Gary Franchi here with us today to talk about everything that's happening.
[03:11:14.458 --> 03:11:16.098]  Gary, good to have you.
[03:11:16.098 --> 03:11:17.319]  Alex, it's a pleasure to be here.
[03:11:17.319 --> 03:11:18.079]  Thanks for having me back.
[03:11:19.008 --> 03:11:21.370]  Well, I mean, so much is going on, so much is happening.
[03:11:21.370 --> 03:11:23.832]  The solution is this film.
[03:11:23.832 --> 03:11:25.053]  You can hand this to somebody.
[03:11:25.053 --> 03:11:28.675]  The difference between a republic and a democracy.
[03:11:28.675 --> 03:11:34.840]  Break it down for folks why they need to get and have viewing parties and show it to everyone they know.
[03:11:34.840 --> 03:11:36.241]  Rise of the Republic.
[03:11:36.241 --> 03:11:36.962]  Don't tread on me.
[03:11:37.898 --> 03:11:42.944]  Well, you know, Alex, the reason we made this film is because so often we're asked, well, where are the solutions?
[03:11:42.944 --> 03:11:46.728]  You know, all I hear is the problem, the problem, the problem.
[03:11:46.728 --> 03:11:48.871]  So that's why we set out to make this film.
[03:11:48.871 --> 03:11:57.360]  And it's sort of like a it's like an unofficial sequel to Camp FEMA, if you would, because if you're watching the end of Camp FEMA, we start to go into states rights and
[03:11:58.321 --> 03:12:02.085]  I got the idea one night when I was watching and screening Camfima once again.
[03:12:02.085 --> 03:12:05.389]  I said, you know, we really got to expound on this issue.
[03:12:05.389 --> 03:12:18.203]  We got to expound upon the Tenth Amendment and really give people the information that they need so that they can introduce the legislation that we talk about in the film that can really put teeth into the Tenth Amendment.
[03:12:18.823 --> 03:12:26.048]  Uh, that can reign in the federal government and also expose the different methods the federal government uses to reign in the states.
[03:12:26.048 --> 03:12:30.991]  You know, we call it the choke collar that the federal government uses.
[03:12:30.991 --> 03:12:38.657]  So it's not just about states' rights, but we also talk about empowering the individual with the Second Amendment and what that really means.
[03:12:38.657 --> 03:12:43.200]  We talked to Edwin Vieira about the constitutional militia.
[03:12:44.040 --> 03:12:51.882]  We talked to Charles Key in Oklahoma, one of the big proponents of the 10th Amendment, spearheading the 10th Amendment movement in this country.
[03:12:51.882 --> 03:12:58.864]  So it's really just an excellent cross-section of movements, action, and what people can do to take back this country.
[03:12:58.864 --> 03:12:59.564]  And history!
[03:12:59.564 --> 03:13:00.105]  And history!
[03:13:00.105 --> 03:13:04.106]  I mean, over and over again you explain the difference between a republic and a democracy.
[03:13:04.106 --> 03:13:04.946]  Break it down for folks.
[03:13:05.586 --> 03:13:07.708]  Well, most folks don't even realize it.
[03:13:07.708 --> 03:13:10.791]  You ask the average person on the street, they say, well, we are a democracy.
[03:13:10.791 --> 03:13:11.692]  And you say, no, no, no.
[03:13:11.692 --> 03:13:12.412]  We are a republic.
[03:13:12.412 --> 03:13:13.353]  We are based on laws.
[03:13:13.353 --> 03:13:18.958]  Democracy is what is so often referred to as, you know, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:13:18.958 --> 03:13:20.559]  You know, majority rules.
[03:13:20.559 --> 03:13:22.161]  And that's not necessarily the case here.
[03:13:22.681 --> 03:13:24.802]  It is the law that is in control.
[03:13:24.802 --> 03:13:28.164]  It's the Constitution that is the foundation for this country.
[03:13:28.164 --> 03:13:29.184]  And that's what the film's about.
[03:13:29.184 --> 03:13:31.386]  It's about restoring the constitutional values of this nation.
[03:13:31.386 --> 03:13:32.986]  Yeah, democracy is very dangerous.
[03:13:32.986 --> 03:13:39.009]  I mean, if you have a democracy, I want to go back to Greece 2,400 years ago.
[03:13:39.009 --> 03:13:42.191]  Only the elite families had voting.
[03:13:42.191 --> 03:13:44.092]  And they would go up to the top of a hill.
[03:13:44.092 --> 03:13:44.852]  This is on record.
[03:13:44.852 --> 03:13:47.694]  They had a bucket for black rocks, a bucket for white rocks.
[03:13:48.414 --> 03:14:11.260]  And a white rock was a yay, a black rock was a nay, and that was the first parliamentary procedure, and they had a little amphitheater, and there was a cliff about a hundred yards away, and this is historical fact, and they had different voting centers, and routinely they'd have a vote on, we're mad at this philosopher, he's calling, you know, for overthrowing our corrupt system, and they would vote to kill him or not, and they'd go throw him off the cliff.
[03:14:12.020 --> 03:14:13.421]  Or chop his head off.
[03:14:13.421 --> 03:14:24.046]  So, in a democracy, if you can get 51% to vote to steal somebody's ranch, or farm, or business, or make them pay more taxes, then you can do it.
[03:14:24.046 --> 03:14:28.088]  In a democracy, in a republic, everyone is protected by that Bill of Rights.
[03:14:28.088 --> 03:14:30.609]  And nothing, nothing can overturn it.
[03:14:30.609 --> 03:14:32.750]  And if someone tries to, they are a tyrant!
[03:14:33.737 --> 03:14:37.779]  Right, it doesn't matter if you're a minority or a majority in the population.
[03:14:37.779 --> 03:14:44.463]  It is the law and it is the rights that are inherent in the Constitution that allow us to have the freedom.
[03:14:44.463 --> 03:14:52.327]  Let me just point out our inalienable rights, absolutely, that exist as the Ninth Amendment states, that exist before this compact.
[03:14:52.327 --> 03:14:59.251]  This is just a statement of the already observed liberties of the free humans on this planet.
[03:15:00.299 --> 03:15:01.560]  Well, you're absolutely right, Alex.
[03:15:01.560 --> 03:15:08.623]  And, you know, the film itself, I love the video you made.
[03:15:08.623 --> 03:15:12.384]  You kind of smirked in the video and you said the Southern Poverty Law Center is really going to love this film.
[03:15:14.591 --> 03:15:17.715]  Camp FEMA was out there for them, apparently.
[03:15:17.715 --> 03:15:22.120]  But this film is really going to get under their skin, and we're going to send them an autographed copy.
[03:15:22.120 --> 03:15:29.589]  Well, for those that don't know, on CNN and other channels, they've been demonizing Camp FEMA, and the Southern Poverty Law Center's been demonizing it.
[03:15:29.589 --> 03:15:32.352]  So yeah, if they didn't like that, they're really not going to like this.
[03:15:33.171 --> 03:15:34.031]  No, absolutely not.
[03:15:34.031 --> 03:15:42.155]  I mean, well, look, they want to put out, you know, these rage on the right and the rise of the right, these disinfo pieces out there.
[03:15:42.155 --> 03:15:44.456]  This is the rise of the republic!
[03:15:44.456 --> 03:15:45.097]  Absolutely.
[03:15:45.097 --> 03:15:46.257]  This is the rise of the republic.
[03:15:46.257 --> 03:15:48.018]  We're documenting it here.
[03:15:48.018 --> 03:15:50.960]  And I want people to know that they can make copies of this film.
[03:15:50.960 --> 03:15:54.861]  They make, purchase a copy, make copies, pass it out hand-to-hand.
[03:15:54.861 --> 03:15:57.663]  It's the viral distribution that's going to get this message to the American people.
[03:15:58.359 --> 03:16:01.582]  Well, you've done well, Gary, and so has William Lewis.
[03:16:01.582 --> 03:16:23.920]  I want to play a clip here to illustrate the difference between a mainline moron that doesn't know the Bill of Rights and Constitution, Miss Teen South Carolina a few years ago, versus Miss Oklahoma, Morgan Elizabeth Woollard, the difference between an informed patriot woman and a dingbat educated in the public school system.
[03:16:23.920 --> 03:16:26.782]  Let's go to Miss Teen South Carolina first.
[03:16:30.851 --> 03:16:33.453]  A fifth of Americans can't locate the U.S.
[03:16:33.453 --> 03:16:35.015]  on a world map.
[03:16:35.015 --> 03:16:38.357]  Why do you think this is?
[03:16:38.357 --> 03:16:41.140]  I personally believe that U.S.
[03:16:41.140 --> 03:16:53.090]  Americans are unable to do so because some people out there in our nation don't have maps and I believe that our education, such as
[03:16:53.610 --> 03:17:10.078]  South Africa and the Iraq everywhere like such as and I believe that they should Our education over here in the US should help the US or should help South Africa It should help the Iraq in the Asian countries.
[03:17:10.078 --> 03:17:15.501]  So we will be able to build up our future Thank you very much, South Carolina
[03:17:16.286 --> 03:17:21.070]  Listen how she just mindlessly spewed a bunch of political correct words.
[03:17:21.070 --> 03:17:22.891]  Help the children, help South Africa.
[03:17:22.891 --> 03:17:26.794]  You know, the struggle of the 80s or whatever that was the cause of the lab.
[03:17:26.794 --> 03:17:30.557]  Now let's hear with the USA pageant.
[03:17:30.557 --> 03:17:36.322]  Last night, Miss Oklahoma getting a big cheer when she talked about states' rights.
[03:17:36.322 --> 03:17:40.625]  This is an intelligent woman versus the product of the New World Order.
[03:17:40.625 --> 03:17:41.926]  Here it is.
[03:17:41.926 --> 03:17:43.548]  Oscar Nunez, your question please.
[03:17:45.134 --> 03:17:45.974]  Hello, Miss Oklahoma.
[03:17:45.974 --> 03:17:46.935]  How are you?
[03:17:46.935 --> 03:17:47.675]  I'm doing so great.
[03:17:47.675 --> 03:17:48.456]  Thank you.
[03:17:48.456 --> 03:17:49.276]  Alrighty.
[03:17:49.276 --> 03:17:58.141]  Arizona's new immigration statute authorizes law enforcement authorities to check the citizenship of anyone they believe may be in the country illegally.
[03:17:58.141 --> 03:18:01.923]  Now, listen to the question before you move.
[03:18:01.923 --> 03:18:07.026]  Critics say this may amount to racial profiling.
[03:18:07.026 --> 03:18:11.449]  Do you think that this should be mandated by the state or by the federal government?
[03:18:13.655 --> 03:18:15.897]  I'm a huge believer in states' rights.
[03:18:15.897 --> 03:18:26.144]  I think that's what's so wonderful about America.
[03:18:26.144 --> 03:18:30.747]  So I think it's perfectly fine for Arizona to create that law.
[03:18:30.747 --> 03:18:35.150]  And I am against illegal immigration, but I'm also against racial profiling.
[03:18:35.150 --> 03:18:36.611]  So I see both sides in this issue.
[03:18:39.969 --> 03:18:41.330]  Okay, so there you go.
[03:18:41.330 --> 03:18:43.991]  He was trying to cue them to boo her.
[03:18:43.991 --> 03:18:45.531]  Don't boo yet!
[03:18:45.531 --> 03:18:46.912]  And they didn't boo.
[03:18:46.912 --> 03:18:48.432]  They cheered her.
[03:18:48.432 --> 03:18:52.554]  And so, again, and they tried to misconstrue what this law does.
[03:18:52.554 --> 03:18:59.197]  It only allows after first contact, say with a drunk driver, if they're not a citizen, to enforce the law.
[03:19:00.077 --> 03:19:08.183]  And then meanwhile, citizens have checkpoints, the feds are funding everywhere, Gary Franchi, and I never hear Barack Obama decrying that.
[03:19:08.183 --> 03:19:12.286]  I want equal protection under the law, but what an illustration, Gary.
[03:19:12.286 --> 03:19:14.467]  Yeah, that was a beautiful answer, you know.
[03:19:14.467 --> 03:19:18.850]  I was cracking up when I heard the first girl.
[03:19:18.850 --> 03:19:20.631]  Classic clip there.
[03:19:20.631 --> 03:19:23.333]  The second clip, though, just stellar response.
[03:19:23.333 --> 03:19:24.574]  Beautiful.
[03:19:24.574 --> 03:19:28.357]  But that's the difference between a patriot and a dingbat who doesn't even know what planet she's on.
[03:19:29.028 --> 03:19:31.309]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:19:31.309 --> 03:19:33.929]  Well, there's nothing better than an intelligent, beautiful woman.
[03:19:33.929 --> 03:19:35.150]  I love it.
[03:19:35.150 --> 03:19:37.910]  And more and more of them are standing up and taking action, Gary.
[03:19:37.910 --> 03:19:41.131]  When we come back, just for a quick segment, you'll be on with us.
[03:19:41.131 --> 03:19:46.713]  I'm going to get Webster Tarpley's take on what's happening in Bangkok, Thailand right now.
[03:19:46.713 --> 03:19:49.593]  Patriots or banker-funded uprising.
[03:19:49.593 --> 03:19:51.274]  People fighting back with slingshots against
[03:19:52.330 --> 03:19:58.915]  M16s, I tend to lean towards them, but we've got to burrow into exactly what's happening here with Gary Franchi.
[03:19:58.915 --> 03:20:01.818]  Webster Tartley on for one segment.
[03:20:01.818 --> 03:20:04.160]  They helped to create a new world order.
[03:20:04.160 --> 03:20:06.522]  We are part of a new world order.
[03:20:06.522 --> 03:20:09.744]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[03:20:09.744 --> 03:20:14.848]  Invisible empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:20:14.848 --> 03:20:19.032]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:20:19.338 --> 03:20:21.681]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:20:21.681 --> 03:20:24.224]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:20:24.224 --> 03:20:27.487]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:20:27.487 --> 03:20:35.096]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:20:35.416 --> 03:20:40.818]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:20:40.818 --> 03:20:43.658]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:20:43.658 --> 03:20:47.339]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:20:47.339 --> 03:20:49.760]  And I got news for you, you're everyone else.
[03:20:49.760 --> 03:20:51.261]  Invisible Empire.

[03:24:10.831 --> 03:24:24.405]  But for just five minutes, historian and good friend of mine, Webster Griffin Tarpley, pops in with us to give us his take on what's happening in Thailand.
[03:24:24.405 --> 03:24:24.746]  Webster.
[03:24:25.905 --> 03:24:29.868]  Alex, I think Thailand is basically a mess, and here's what it is.
[03:24:29.868 --> 03:24:31.129]  You have these two parties, right?
[03:24:31.129 --> 03:24:40.817]  You have the red shirts who demand the return of the exiled Prime Minister Thaksin, and they've been engaging in some protests, but also some violence.
[03:24:41.437 --> 03:24:48.280]  Then you have the government, which is this guy Abhisit, representing the privileged classes, basically.
[03:24:48.280 --> 03:24:53.702]  You have to remember that in Thailand, the army is traditionally a big political power, and you have a monarchy.
[03:24:53.702 --> 03:25:01.126]  You have King Bhumibol, who is now pretty old, but he was quite a firm hand over quite a few decades.
[03:25:01.126 --> 03:25:05.968]  Now, Thaksin, the exiled guy that the richards want to bring back,
[03:25:06.548 --> 03:25:10.610]  When he was in power from 2001 to 2006, he did some good things.
[03:25:10.610 --> 03:25:14.931]  He got the International Monetary Fund out of the country, always good.
[03:25:14.931 --> 03:25:17.032]  He instituted a healthcare system.
[03:25:17.032 --> 03:25:20.093]  He also gave farmers a moratorium on debt.
[03:25:20.093 --> 03:25:22.574]  They got debt relief from this guy.
[03:25:22.574 --> 03:25:25.835]  The problem with this is that the red shirts of today
[03:25:26.698 --> 03:25:27.579]  We're good to go.
[03:25:44.173 --> 03:25:50.038]  Thailand is one of the string of pearls, one of the countries that China would like to have good relations with.
[03:25:50.038 --> 03:25:56.923]  China wants stability, they want predictability, they're willing to compromise with some pretty ugly people.
[03:25:56.923 --> 03:25:59.265]  So more Western encirclement of China.
[03:26:00.301 --> 03:26:01.002]  I'm not sure.
[03:26:01.002 --> 03:26:02.622]  Look, it's a little bit more complicated.
[03:26:02.622 --> 03:26:04.243]  Here's what I would say right now.
[03:26:04.243 --> 03:26:09.966]  If you look at the Chinese coverage on Thailand, they don't seem to choose sides very clearly.
[03:26:09.966 --> 03:26:14.868]  What they do is deplore the fact that the society is breaking down, right?
[03:26:14.868 --> 03:26:22.172]  That democracy has failed, that you've got essentially the breakdown of the political system, and you're headed for chaos.
[03:26:22.172 --> 03:26:28.915]  And I would also stress, the world economic depression in the background is fueling chaos in many countries.
[03:26:29.435 --> 03:26:35.180]  So with this, you might say that Thailand is on its way to being some kind of a permanently failed state.
[03:26:35.180 --> 03:26:40.325]  The Wall Street Journal of this morning wants the existing government to step down, to resign.
[03:26:40.325 --> 03:26:41.265]  So that's clear enough.
[03:26:41.265 --> 03:26:48.872]  But I think they want that with the idea that Thailand will descend into chaos, and that will become a problem for China, right?
[03:26:48.872 --> 03:26:51.714]  Chaos, refugees, and so forth.
[03:26:51.714 --> 03:26:54.557]  So again, I think this is really, really a mess.
[03:26:56.374 --> 03:26:58.675]  Alright, we've got about two minutes left.
[03:26:58.675 --> 03:27:00.156]  We haven't talked to you in about a week.
[03:27:00.156 --> 03:27:08.420]  The deterioration with the Euro, with Germany now threatening to pull out or issue a new mark state.
[03:27:08.420 --> 03:27:09.280]  Where do you see that going?
[03:27:09.827 --> 03:27:13.268]  Well, this is also chaos now, but this is very clear.
[03:27:13.268 --> 03:27:15.249]  This is the attack of the hedge funds.
[03:27:15.249 --> 03:27:21.651]  The hedge fund hyenas using credit default swap derivatives are continuing to attack Greece and the Euro.
[03:27:21.651 --> 03:27:26.193]  And the thing that the Europeans have got to do is pull themselves together, kick out the U.S.
[03:27:26.193 --> 03:27:26.773]  hedge funds,
[03:27:27.313 --> 03:27:27.753]  Well said.
[03:27:27.753 --> 03:27:33.055]  Are things deteriorating more quickly than they were last week or any other developments on the economic front?
[03:27:52.062 --> 03:27:56.788]  Well, you know, you've got the continued pressure, right?
[03:27:56.788 --> 03:27:59.652]  And it's essentially a bunch of shorts, right?
[03:27:59.652 --> 03:28:01.535]  People are shorting the euro.
[03:28:01.535 --> 03:28:05.019]  And again, nowadays, they don't do a sort of old-fashioned short.
[03:28:05.019 --> 03:28:06.541]  They do the credit default swap.
[03:28:07.242 --> 03:28:17.936]  As a short, and they do that behind the screen of these hedge funds, you can be sure that the main zombie banks, JP Morgan and Bank of America and so forth, they're all up to their necks in this.
[03:28:17.936 --> 03:28:23.944]  And the irony is that Greece is more viable than the bankrupt zombie banks that are attacking Greece.
[03:28:25.045 --> 03:28:27.506]  Well, that came out with Iceland.
[03:28:27.506 --> 03:28:33.709]  Once they had said no, the books got opened and it turned out it was the banks that were in trouble and that Iceland didn't know the money.
[03:28:33.709 --> 03:28:40.432]  In the last minute, a little silly side note, but I want to correct it if it's wrong because I got a few emails and saw a YouTube comment.
[03:28:40.432 --> 03:28:45.474]  I had read a book that you had written on history and I had read that you were
[03:28:45.954 --> 03:28:52.818]  I had a doctorate in history, and so I called you Dr. Tarpley, and I'd read that in other books that were mentioning you.
[03:28:52.818 --> 03:28:55.279]  You'd never really talked about it, but you are a doctor, correct?
[03:28:55.279 --> 03:28:55.900]  Yes, right.
[03:28:55.900 --> 03:29:04.244]  A PhD in history from Catholic University of America, especially in the Venetian history of the 17th century.
[03:29:04.244 --> 03:29:09.828]  And if you want to go to WorldCat, the world library catalog, you can see my...
[03:29:11.076 --> 03:29:12.737]  I have a doctorate in history and that's it.
[03:29:12.737 --> 03:29:13.957]  That's the one that I have.
[03:29:13.957 --> 03:29:14.537]  I don't have any others.
[03:29:26.562 --> 03:29:28.183]  Okay, not a big issue.
[03:29:28.183 --> 03:29:34.846]  What matters is your predictions, the books you've written, have all come true, and that's why we have you on here almost on a weekly basis.
[03:29:34.846 --> 03:29:38.087]  And all four of your books are available at Infowars.com.
[03:29:38.087 --> 03:29:41.048]  Webster, great having you on with us, Dr. Tarpley.
[03:29:41.048 --> 03:29:42.069]  All right, thank you so much.
[03:29:42.069 --> 03:29:44.309]  See, folks, it didn't make it up, okay?
[03:29:44.309 --> 03:29:51.793]  I was reading another history book that was quoting Dr. Tarpley in it and mentioned his degree in Venetian banking history.
[03:29:51.793 --> 03:29:53.193]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.193 --> 03:29:54.694]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.720 --> 03:29:58.384]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[03:31:00.905 --> 03:31:05.089]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[03:31:05.089 --> 03:31:11.494]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[03:31:11.494 --> 03:31:18.901]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[03:31:18.901 --> 03:31:23.765]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[03:31:32.414 --> 03:31:36.139]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[03:31:36.673 --> 03:31:43.435]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[03:31:43.435 --> 03:31:47.336]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[03:31:53.697 --> 03:31:54.498]  Thank you.
[03:32:01.721 --> 03:32:02.302]  Fact.
[03:32:02.302 --> 03:32:03.663]  Four million people in the U.S.
[03:32:03.663 --> 03:32:05.785]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[03:32:05.785 --> 03:32:06.305]  Fact.
[03:32:06.305 --> 03:32:09.988]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the eighth leading cause of death among Americans.
[03:32:09.988 --> 03:32:10.609]  Fact.
[03:32:10.609 --> 03:32:16.113]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[03:32:16.113 --> 03:32:16.754]  Fact.
[03:32:16.754 --> 03:32:20.957]  One in ten Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[03:32:20.957 --> 03:32:21.538]  Fact.
[03:32:21.538 --> 03:32:25.241]  Anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.

[03:33:14.426 --> 03:33:17.047]  I was a prisoner of doubt!
[03:33:17.047 --> 03:33:26.051]  Not anymore!
[03:33:26.051 --> 03:33:31.533]  I'll take my chances on the Republic!
[03:33:31.533 --> 03:33:32.554]  Deal me in!
[03:33:38.266 --> 03:33:46.532]  All right, I got some key news I want to hit with Gary Franchi and talk more about the film Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic, and Take Your Phone Calls.
[03:33:46.532 --> 03:33:54.138]  I reserved comment about the police killing a seven-year-old girl serving a warrant in Detroit.
[03:33:54.138 --> 03:33:55.379]  I wanted to give this time.
[03:33:55.379 --> 03:33:57.881]  I do this a lot.
[03:33:57.881 --> 03:34:00.123]  Before I got into it, I wanted to give it some time.
[03:34:00.123 --> 03:34:05.747]  It didn't even take a day to come out that the police basically killed her in cold blood.
[03:34:06.906 --> 03:34:09.808]  A lot of these people that join SWAT teams are idiots.
[03:34:09.808 --> 03:34:12.230]  And they use them too much.
[03:34:12.230 --> 03:34:13.931]  And we've talked about that.
[03:34:13.931 --> 03:34:17.494]  Turns out they killed her and lied about it, as usual.
[03:34:17.494 --> 03:34:19.535]  They had an A&E film crew with them.
[03:34:19.535 --> 03:34:23.698]  They were gonna be big movie stars.
[03:34:23.698 --> 03:34:26.280]  They weren't even in the house when they shot her.
[03:34:26.280 --> 03:34:29.242]  And they knew there was a film crew and they lied about it.
[03:34:29.242 --> 03:34:32.124]  I mean, I'm gonna talk about it with Gary Franchi in a moment.
[03:34:32.124 --> 03:34:33.766]  Also, speaking of lying,
[03:34:34.875 --> 03:34:42.400]  We have caught the Texas Film Commission lying yet again.
[03:34:42.400 --> 03:34:48.204]  We pulled up mainstream news articles where they admit the Texas Film Commission is funding the film Machete.
[03:34:48.204 --> 03:34:57.810]  Hey, Robert Rodriguez can make his race war film for Division, but I have free speech to speak out against it, and we called the Film Commission and they said, yes, we're funding it with state money.
[03:34:57.810 --> 03:34:59.191]  I know all his films are funded with it.
[03:35:00.165 --> 03:35:14.216]  Then we had the press secretary call us Friday, we talked to her, of Rick Perry's office, saying it wasn't true, and we added her comment to our article that went viral and was in the New York newspapers, the Washington Post, and everywhere else.
[03:35:14.216 --> 03:35:18.019]  Drudge Report, on and on and on, Washington Post.
[03:35:18.019 --> 03:35:23.663]  We added that to that article, and got played by Rick Perry again.
[03:35:23.663 --> 03:35:25.505]  They're lying about it.
[03:35:25.505 --> 03:35:27.987]  And I have the San Antonio Express News from a year ago.
[03:35:29.321 --> 03:35:37.904]  I have Slackerwood, I have other mainstream news articles, where they have the film commission at meetings and the head of the film commission saying they're funding it.
[03:35:37.904 --> 03:35:39.845]  Of course they're funding the stinking thing!
[03:35:39.845 --> 03:35:42.506]  We called there and they admitted it before we wrote the story!
[03:35:42.506 --> 03:35:45.748]  What do you think, we just make stuff up around here?
[03:35:45.748 --> 03:35:48.369]  Rob Due got on the stinking telephone!
[03:35:48.369 --> 03:35:49.829]  Alright, I'm sorry, I want to go to Gary Franchi.
[03:35:49.829 --> 03:35:53.811]  Let me plug the sponsors, we're going to them here, I just can't handle it anymore.
[03:35:53.811 --> 03:35:56.312]  Uh, efoodsdirect.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:35:58.237 --> 03:36:05.900]  Folks, don't forget that it is important to have your own storable food in these insane times in case we go into a complete collapse type scenario.
[03:36:05.900 --> 03:36:12.683]  They have the highest quality, freshly made, best prices, biggest company out there, longest continually operating.
[03:36:12.683 --> 03:36:14.364]  There's a lot of dangerous crud out there.
[03:36:14.364 --> 03:36:15.504]  There's some good outfits as well.
[03:36:15.504 --> 03:36:17.305]  I'm just telling you, this is a sure deal.
[03:36:17.305 --> 03:36:18.465]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:36:18.465 --> 03:36:19.306]  Never stand in a bread line.
[03:36:19.306 --> 03:36:19.966]  You have your own bread.
[03:36:19.966 --> 03:36:20.026]  800-409-5633.
[03:36:20.026 --> 03:36:20.226]  800-409-5633.
[03:36:20.226 --> 03:36:20.486]  The letter E.
[03:36:25.168 --> 03:36:26.148]  We're good to go.
[03:36:43.516 --> 03:36:46.758]  Water out of the air, that's what clouds are, and precipitates it.
[03:36:46.758 --> 03:36:48.418]  Their smallest unit, 7 gallons a day.
[03:36:48.418 --> 03:36:49.879]  Their next unit, 8 gallons a day.
[03:36:49.879 --> 03:36:51.960]  7 to 12 filters depending on what unit.
[03:36:51.960 --> 03:36:54.721]  They've got big units that can supply thousands.
[03:36:54.721 --> 03:36:55.382]  They've got it all.
[03:36:55.382 --> 03:36:56.482]  Ecolablue.com.
[03:36:56.482 --> 03:36:58.543]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com.
[03:36:58.543 --> 03:36:59.504]  Ecolablue.com or 800-691-6043.
[03:37:02.325 --> 03:37:06.287]  Stop drinking the fluoride rat water that they feed us in the cities.
[03:37:06.287 --> 03:37:09.668]  Well water is usually good, but not always, especially if it's a shallow well.
[03:37:09.668 --> 03:37:10.728]  You need the backup at ColorBlue.com 800-691-6043.
[03:37:10.728 --> 03:37:10.828]  Okay.
[03:37:10.828 --> 03:37:11.609]  I want to go back to Gary Franchi.
[03:37:16.235 --> 03:37:19.017]  Gary, this type of stuff makes me really, really angry.
[03:37:19.017 --> 03:37:23.279]  Police, A&E video crew at site of child shooting.
[03:37:23.279 --> 03:37:38.248]  The headline should be, this is from WLNSTV News 6, this should be police caught lying, because I have the other articles from CNN, you name it, where the cops were saying it was an accident, that the mother jumped on them, and all these other lies.
[03:37:38.248 --> 03:37:43.931]  The A&E footage, the crime show, the first 48, shows a shot fired
[03:37:45.333 --> 03:38:01.359]  After police threw a flashbang inside the home, and I have other articles on this, seconds after, they flow a flashbang in, a cop... I've seen Texas cases where they shoot their own cop in the back, and then frame the guy inside the house who didn't even have guns, until a SWAT team guy told the truth.
[03:38:01.359 --> 03:38:04.140]  But I mean, it's just... It's insane!
[03:38:04.140 --> 03:38:05.661]  Uh, Gary Franchi, your take on this?
[03:38:05.661 --> 03:38:08.922]  You know, why were they going in the house in the first place?
[03:38:08.922 --> 03:38:09.222]  Do we know?
[03:38:10.259 --> 03:38:15.541]  Oh, they claimed that they were serving a murder investigation warrant, but it turns out that the person wasn't there.
[03:38:16.539 --> 03:38:25.965]  Okay, so they obviously didn't bother to do any proper surveillance or do their homework and said they barge into the house and they shoot this young girl.
[03:38:25.965 --> 03:38:26.946]  Is that the story then?
[03:38:26.946 --> 03:38:30.428]  Yeah, killed her, got her in a hammer, shot her in the neck, blew her head off basically.
[03:38:30.428 --> 03:38:32.089]  Oh God.
[03:38:32.089 --> 03:38:37.253]  Alex is... I'm sorry, this is a terrible tragedy.
[03:38:37.253 --> 03:38:40.215]  I'm sorry, it's disgusting and despicable.
[03:38:40.215 --> 03:38:43.317]  I know we're talking about states' rights here, but this is a local
[03:38:46.107 --> 03:38:46.809]  Police, right?
[03:38:46.809 --> 03:38:51.338]  Local SWATs?
[03:38:51.338 --> 03:38:52.621]  What's going to happen to these guys?
[03:38:52.621 --> 03:38:53.844]  Are they going to get promoted?
[03:38:53.844 --> 03:38:55.026]  They'll probably get a medal, yeah.
[03:38:56.673 --> 03:38:57.774]  Unbelievable.
[03:38:57.774 --> 03:39:11.004]  Well, my issue is we've all seen them killing dogs in houses for a gram of marijuana, and that's basically, I've been corrected, that's two marijuana cigarettes, and they just shoot the corgi and the bulldog, and it's basically funny to them.
[03:39:11.004 --> 03:39:14.367]  This is the phony drug war, which again is another states' rights issue.
[03:39:14.367 --> 03:39:21.673]  Fourteen states are trying to decriminalize, do the same thing so we don't collapse like Mexico or China with their past drug wars.
[03:39:21.673 --> 03:39:24.415]  Again, let's get into that along the lines of Don't Tread on Me.
[03:39:25.646 --> 03:39:30.849]  Well, what I'm concerned with here is the overuse of aggression by police.
[03:39:30.849 --> 03:39:32.330]  I mean, you're seeing it.
[03:39:32.330 --> 03:39:33.671]  There is an upward trend of this.
[03:39:33.671 --> 03:39:38.293]  I mean, they're kicking at people's doors for, you know, a couple of marijuana cigarettes.
[03:39:38.293 --> 03:39:49.940]  They're tasering people at police checkpoints or just standard traffic stops because somebody doesn't want to sign their rights away on a ticket.
[03:39:49.940 --> 03:39:51.321]  It's absurd the amount of
[03:39:52.915 --> 03:39:55.860]  Look, the American people are fed up.
[03:39:55.860 --> 03:39:57.863]  And we document in the film.
[03:39:57.863 --> 03:40:03.592]  I mean, it all comes back to what's going on at the local level, at the state level.
[03:40:03.592 --> 03:40:06.356]  We need to get the American people fired up.
[03:40:06.356 --> 03:40:07.718]  We need to take this country back.
[03:40:09.486 --> 03:40:12.670]  It's what side of the line are you going to stand on?
[03:40:12.670 --> 03:40:18.658]  I mean, how much abuse are the American people going to take before we just say enough is enough?
[03:40:18.658 --> 03:40:22.783]  I mean, the Greeks over there, I have family in Greece right now.
[03:40:23.986 --> 03:40:25.787]  Who cannot leave Greece.
[03:40:25.787 --> 03:40:35.271]  They're locked in their homes because people are rioting in the streets because of the socialist tactics of the international bankers that are going on right now.
[03:40:35.271 --> 03:40:37.432]  And it's going to happen here!
[03:40:37.432 --> 03:40:39.733]  But we don't want that to happen.
[03:40:39.733 --> 03:40:40.953]  The American people have to rise up.
[03:40:43.354 --> 03:40:48.257]  Dealing with states' rights that are covered in the film Don't Tread on Me, so people understand this is the key.
[03:40:48.257 --> 03:40:54.180]  What's your view on the Arizona law, A, and B, have you seen my coverage of Machete?
[03:40:54.180 --> 03:40:58.382]  We've gotten the script and it clearly is trying to invoke a race war.
[03:40:58.382 --> 03:41:00.764]  Again, more divide and conquer.
[03:41:00.764 --> 03:41:05.406]  Well, the Arizona law, in my opinion, it's needed.
[03:41:05.406 --> 03:41:07.207]  It is needed.
[03:41:07.207 --> 03:41:07.668]  As far as
[03:41:08.686 --> 03:41:11.427]  The first contact situation with the police.
[03:41:11.427 --> 03:41:15.830]  All the rhetoric I'm seeing from the opposing viewpoint is, oh, they're just going to start racial profiling.
[03:41:15.830 --> 03:41:20.212]  They're going to start, you know, busting down illegals left and right.
[03:41:20.212 --> 03:41:22.453]  But there has to have, they have to have a reason.
[03:41:22.453 --> 03:41:26.075]  Well, that's like the cock fight with a hundred people at it.
[03:41:26.075 --> 03:41:28.556]  20 plus illegal aliens, Arpaio arrested them all.
[03:41:30.282 --> 03:41:33.647]  Well, look... But that's first contact!
[03:41:33.647 --> 03:41:35.008]  I mean, that's first contact!
[03:41:35.008 --> 03:41:40.896]  They were there for illegal gambling, to the killing of animals, and there was drug dealing going on!
[03:41:40.896 --> 03:41:43.340]  Well, then they should be able to check the status!
[03:41:43.340 --> 03:41:44.761]  Look, my family came here...
[03:41:45.981 --> 03:41:50.242]  A couple generations ago, they checked in at Ellis Island, they did it the right way.
[03:41:50.242 --> 03:41:54.943]  You know, come on, let's have some respect for the border, let's have some respect for the American culture.
[03:41:54.943 --> 03:42:03.346]  I mean, see, I'm seeing kids' stories about kids being kicked out of schools because they're wearing American flag t-shirts, because it's inflammatory.
[03:42:03.346 --> 03:42:09.767]  I mean, Alex, this country is in a rapid descent, and if we don't do something now, we are going to lose it.
[03:42:09.767 --> 03:42:11.648]  We are going to lose the country we're fighting for.
[03:42:12.583 --> 03:42:17.965]  I heartily agree with you, and it's all covered in Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[03:42:17.965 --> 03:42:30.631]  You've got an organization of hundreds of thousands of people that are involved, in the top five or six in the country, with true activists that are really carrying the torch outside the left-right paradigm of constitutional liberty.
[03:42:30.631 --> 03:42:32.912]  I'm seeing exponential awakening.
[03:42:32.912 --> 03:42:34.252]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:42:34.252 --> 03:42:39.975]  Where you're at, give us a report on the type of awakening you're seeing and the mood of the nation.
[03:42:40.615 --> 03:42:50.498]  Well, in all the statistics that I've seen through our show on The Reality Report, through our website membership, it's a constant upward trend.
[03:42:50.498 --> 03:42:59.480]  And that's directly related to the constitutional abuses the American people are experiencing.
[03:42:59.480 --> 03:43:09.323]  We're having up to a thousand people a month joining our website because they're seeking solutions, they're seeking answers, and they're finding it with the other members at RestoreTheRepublic.net.
[03:43:11.638 --> 03:43:14.961]  Well, you know, I told the story yesterday, but I'll briefly recap it.
[03:43:14.961 --> 03:43:36.640]  I took my son to a campout birthday party in Wimberley, and it was doctors, lawyers, professionals, you know, this was an elite area of Wimberley, but they're involved in the whole community, and everyone I was talking to, most of them didn't even know who I was, and I liked that, because they didn't know who Alex Jones was, some of them did, but
[03:43:37.861 --> 03:43:38.562]  I don't
[03:43:57.574 --> 03:44:07.045]  They were so informed, and I asked them, I said, what percentage, and some of them were administrators and things, what percentage of this town is awake?
[03:44:07.045 --> 03:44:11.611]  And they'd say, half or more are fully awake and we're waking up the other half.
[03:44:11.611 --> 03:44:12.752]  I mean, this is exciting.
[03:44:13.473 --> 03:44:21.516]  Well you know what Alex, I'm glad you brought that up because I do have an excellent report for you and your listeners are going to be the first to hear it.
[03:44:21.516 --> 03:44:27.138]  Our magazine, Republic Magazine, just got picked up for national distribution by books a million.
[03:44:27.138 --> 03:44:30.779]  And just about a month or so ago we got picked up by Barnes & Noble.
[03:44:30.779 --> 03:44:38.642]  So our message is going to be on every single newsstand at those national magazine distribution companies all across the country.
[03:44:39.639 --> 03:44:42.441]  And they're picking it up because they know this message is selling.
[03:44:42.441 --> 03:44:46.084]  People won't buy Time Magazine anymore, but they'll get Restore the Republic.
[03:44:46.084 --> 03:44:49.886]  Yes, and because the truth will prevail, Alex.
[03:44:49.886 --> 03:44:51.407]  Because the message is pure.
[03:44:51.407 --> 03:44:52.548]  The message is right.
[03:44:52.548 --> 03:44:56.371]  And the people are gravitating to, they can see through the garbage.
[03:44:56.371 --> 03:44:56.911]  Okay?
[03:44:56.911 --> 03:45:01.735]  Half the people I speak to do not trust the mainstream media anymore.
[03:45:01.735 --> 03:45:08.240]  That's why they're seeking out people like yourself, people like Republic Magazine, they watch my show, because they're looking for answers.
[03:45:10.029 --> 03:45:12.310]  They're seeing through the mess, Alex.
[03:45:29.761 --> 03:45:30.562]  Patriot Movement.
[03:45:30.562 --> 03:45:32.003]  This film needs to be seen everywhere.
[03:45:32.003 --> 03:45:39.289]  I'm so glad that you and William Lewis have decided to encourage people to make copies of it and to get it out to everyone they know.
[03:45:39.289 --> 03:45:45.174]  Gary Franchi and William Lewis present Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[03:45:45.174 --> 03:45:45.495]  R.J.
[03:45:45.495 --> 03:45:52.501]  Harris, Michael Bagnerik, Tom DeWeese, Alex Jones, Eben Vieira, Richard Mack, Cynthia Davis, Charles Key, and many, many others.
[03:45:52.501 --> 03:45:53.782]  Again, InfoWars.com.
[03:45:54.082 --> 03:45:55.383]  Hi, I just have a quick question.
[03:45:55.383 --> 03:46:04.687]  My parents are part of a credit union and they swear that their money is safe in the credit union and I don't know if it is safe in the credit union or just because it's not a bank it's not safe and I don't know.
[03:46:04.687 --> 03:46:07.308]  I wanted to know what you thought about that.
[03:46:24.838 --> 03:46:28.321]  I think hedging your bets if your money is in banks.
[03:46:28.321 --> 03:46:29.502]  Local is the way to go.
[03:46:29.502 --> 03:46:30.803]  Credit unions are the way to go.
[03:46:30.803 --> 03:46:35.767]  Go look at their state rating, not just their Barron's or Forbes rating.
[03:46:35.767 --> 03:46:36.988]  Put the name of the bank.
[03:46:36.988 --> 03:46:42.992]  I mean, just Google the term, or search engine the term, or startpage.com the term, whatever you want.
[03:46:42.992 --> 03:46:44.554]  Bank ratings in your state.
[03:46:44.994 --> 03:46:53.236]  And then look at the ratings of local banks and then split your money into the number one and number two banks if you need money and capital in the banking system.
[03:46:53.236 --> 03:47:11.339]  What we're going into is so dangerous that I don't even know if it's safe for people to have money in the bank, but if you've got a business like mine, an operation, where you've got to pay for things and pay employees, I mean, if you've got an operation with 15, 20, 30 people, you've got to have a bunch of money in the bank just to pay payroll and taxes and run the operation.
[03:47:11.339 --> 03:47:12.520]  But I appreciate your call, Kevin.
[03:47:12.520 --> 03:47:14.020]  Let's get a take on that from Gary Franchi.
[03:47:14.963 --> 03:47:30.470]  Well, I think, you know, precious metals is absolutely crucial at this time because, you know, at the end of the day, when everything goes down, paper is worthless and you'll be able to start a fire with it, maybe, you know, if your water still, you know, if your water doesn't put it out right.
[03:47:30.470 --> 03:47:31.351]  Look, it's about...
[03:47:32.051 --> 03:47:34.332]  Hello Alex, good to be on your show.
[03:47:34.332 --> 03:47:36.052]  I wanted to let you know that
[03:48:00.240 --> 03:48:03.922]  I wanted to ask you a question after I leave this comment real quick.
[03:48:03.922 --> 03:48:12.687]  On the Discovery Channel on June 8, 2003, there was a show, you know, the American Chopper?
[03:48:12.687 --> 03:48:14.788]  The motorcycles, yeah.
[03:48:14.788 --> 03:48:16.069]  Yes.
[03:48:16.069 --> 03:48:22.452]  Well, what happened is, on Jesse Ventura's show, they were trying to find a piece on 9-11 Truth.
[03:48:22.452 --> 03:48:27.035]  I mean, on the World Trade Center, a piece of the World Trade Center.
[03:48:27.035 --> 03:48:29.416]  Well, welded to the bike.
[03:48:30.476 --> 03:48:35.097]  It's called the fire bike on the... I'm a little flustered, it's my first phone call.
[03:48:35.097 --> 03:48:38.058]  Yeah, you're talking about the wreckage of the steel, go ahead.
[03:48:38.058 --> 03:48:50.542]  Yes, they got a piece of, they got a boat welded onto the gas tank of the bike and they have it, I have a video name on YouTube.
[03:48:50.542 --> 03:48:59.225]  Yeah, well there was lots of other wreckage given to community centers and parks around the country, not just the wreckage that they're hiding in that hangar that Ventura discovered.
[03:49:00.812 --> 03:49:02.613]  Well, can I go in there for a question real quick?
[03:49:02.613 --> 03:49:03.714]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:49:03.714 --> 03:49:04.595]  Real quick.
[03:49:04.595 --> 03:49:18.607]  On Netflix, I've been waiting for shadow government and pre-state, and of course I'm going to probably be waiting for Recover the Republic or Restore the Republic.
[03:49:18.607 --> 03:49:19.128]  When do you think
[03:49:20.254 --> 03:49:20.955]  I bet you are.
[03:49:36.215 --> 03:49:39.598]  And so what they do is they post it, and then they see if there's a response.
[03:49:39.598 --> 03:49:42.700]  And if they basically get one order, then they order that from you.
[03:49:42.700 --> 03:49:45.202]  And so they've ordered it, and they've got it, and it should be shipping out to you.
[03:49:45.202 --> 03:49:48.765]  Netflix has one of the highest ratings out there for customer service.
[03:49:48.765 --> 03:49:50.947]  So we're selling videos to them.
[03:49:50.947 --> 03:49:54.630]  But I think there's that start-off process where there's a few-week lag time.
[03:49:54.630 --> 03:49:56.671]  But I appreciate your call.
[03:49:56.671 --> 03:50:00.494]  So that's key information there for those that want to get those films in their hand.
[03:50:00.494 --> 03:50:01.155]  Quick question.
[03:50:01.155 --> 03:50:01.935]  Mike in Arizona.
[03:50:01.935 --> 03:50:02.356]  You're on the air.
[03:50:03.357 --> 03:50:07.020]  Yes, I have a way to stop the New World Order.
[03:50:07.020 --> 03:50:13.104]  I think by putting a bullet in my sniper gun and killing David Rockefeller.
[03:50:33.410 --> 03:50:37.872]  Well, violence is only going to bring about what they want.
[03:50:37.872 --> 03:50:43.114]  They want to round us up, they want to shut us down, and they want total police state lockdown.
[03:50:43.114 --> 03:50:46.715]  And that violence is what will accomplish that goal.
[03:50:46.715 --> 03:50:49.196]  Plus, it's not one globalist that runs the New World Order.
[03:50:49.196 --> 03:50:50.617]  It's a criminal system.
[03:50:50.617 --> 03:50:53.138]  We want David Rockefeller to have a trial.
[03:50:53.138 --> 03:50:58.780]  We want him to have all the rights that citizens have, because if one person doesn't have rights, none of us have rights, okay?
[03:50:58.780 --> 03:51:01.961]  We'll be back with a few final calls with Gary Franchi, the new film, Don't Tread on Me.
[03:51:04.395 --> 03:51:12.501]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings, knowing it may be another bill collector, it's time for you to call Zero Debt in 90 Days.

[03:51:13.982 --> 03:51:20.067]  Settlements, bankruptcy, and attorneys are not the answer, and may end up costing you up to 10 times more than necessary.
[03:51:20.307 --> 03:51:24.589]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?
[03:51:24.589 --> 03:51:31.973]  Zero Debt in 90 Days gets you out of debt in 90 days, guaranteed, without a payment plan, and without attorneys or going to court.

[03:51:55.442 --> 03:51:56.663]  800-477-9256.
[03:51:56.663 --> 03:51:57.963]  That's 800-477-9256.
[03:51:57.963 --> 03:52:03.804]  They helped to create a new world order.
[03:52:03.804 --> 03:52:06.104]  We are part of a new world order.
[03:52:06.104 --> 03:52:09.325]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[03:52:09.325 --> 03:52:14.066]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:52:14.426 --> 03:52:18.930]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:52:18.930 --> 03:52:21.292]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:52:21.292 --> 03:52:24.175]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:52:24.175 --> 03:52:27.077]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:52:27.077 --> 03:52:34.684]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:52:35.004 --> 03:52:40.409]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:52:40.409 --> 03:52:43.271]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:52:43.271 --> 03:52:46.954]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:52:46.954 --> 03:52:48.035]  And I got news for you.
[03:52:48.035 --> 03:52:49.376]  You're everyone else.
[03:52:49.376 --> 03:52:50.858]  Invisible Empire.

[03:53:01.337 --> 03:53:04.341]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:53:04.341 --> 03:53:09.689]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:53:09.689 --> 03:53:11.732]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:53:11.732 --> 03:53:16.459]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:53:16.459 --> 03:53:16.819]  I think?
[03:53:37.785 --> 03:53:38.085]  We're good.
[03:54:12.431 --> 03:54:13.292]  Yeah.
[03:54:17.930 --> 03:54:20.031]  Think what's happened with the Obama deception.
[03:54:20.031 --> 03:54:24.754]  Of course, there's now attempts out there to censor it, it's really bad.
[03:54:24.754 --> 03:54:30.237]  Think what's happened with Fall of the Republic, what's happened with Loose Change, what's happened with Endgame, Terror Storm.
[03:54:30.237 --> 03:54:35.601]  We now need that to happen with Don't Tread on Me, with screenings around the country, people making copies.
[03:54:35.601 --> 03:54:40.503]  Again, but support the filmmakers, get it at Infowars.com, Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[03:54:40.503 --> 03:54:44.386]  Gary Franchi, you're having simultaneous national screenings come up.
[03:54:44.386 --> 03:54:45.927]  Tell folks how they can get involved in this.
[03:54:46.786 --> 03:54:52.789]  Well, we're going to be putting up a page on our website so people can have the authorization printout form.
[03:54:52.789 --> 03:54:56.331]  And we want people to have screenings on June 26th of this year.
[03:54:56.331 --> 03:54:58.012]  That's a Saturday.
[03:54:58.012 --> 03:55:04.295]  And either in your home, at your public library, rent out the local cinema, do whatever you take.
[03:55:04.295 --> 03:55:10.119]  You know, print out movie posters, print out flyers, put ads out in the local newspapers.
[03:55:11.059 --> 03:55:19.966]  And do a huge national one-day push for a national screening all across this country, Saturday, June 26.
[03:55:19.966 --> 03:55:24.790]  That is D-Day for Don't Tread on Me, the movie, Rise of the Republic, Alex.
[03:55:24.790 --> 03:55:25.911]  Very exciting.
[03:55:25.911 --> 03:55:27.172]  We commend your work.
[03:55:27.172 --> 03:55:32.636]  It's so good to know there's other people out there crashing through the lives of disinformation like yourself.
[03:55:32.636 --> 03:55:35.939]  I'm not walking point alone with you out there and William Lewis.
[03:55:35.939 --> 03:55:38.981]  Let's go ahead and talk to Corey in B.C.
[03:55:38.981 --> 03:55:39.942]  You're on the air, Corey.
[03:55:40.822 --> 03:55:43.765]  Hey Alex, I just wanted to say one quick statement here.
[03:55:43.765 --> 03:55:52.133]  I agree with most of what you say, but I disagree with one major facet that you keep telling people, and that is this unconstitutional Bill of Rights position.
[03:55:52.133 --> 03:55:55.256]  You have to look at this from a legal perspective.
[03:55:55.256 --> 03:56:03.103]  Most Americans, and Canadians for that matter, are beneficiaries to state beneficiary, federal beneficiary programs.
[03:56:04.108 --> 03:56:07.209]  I can't hire you, Alex, and say, come cut my grass.
[03:56:07.209 --> 03:56:12.812]  I'm going to pay you for that and for you to make a constitutional challenge or a Bill of Rights challenge that you're a slave.
[03:56:12.812 --> 03:56:21.515]  Most people are receiving benefits and they cannot make an argument subsequently after that they don't want to have to pay what to do when they're under contract.
[03:56:21.515 --> 03:56:23.336]  Likewise... I don't understand what you're listening to.
[03:56:23.336 --> 03:56:24.436]  You better simplify it.
[03:56:24.436 --> 03:56:26.197]  What are you talking about?
[03:56:26.197 --> 03:56:29.018]  You say the healthcare system is unconstitutional.
[03:56:29.676 --> 03:56:34.257]  That's a beneficiary program for people who are pursuing profit in commerce as taxpayers.
[03:56:34.257 --> 03:56:37.398]  No, no, the Commerce Clause, that's what's covered in this film.
[03:56:37.398 --> 03:56:42.019]  The federal government in 235 years has never been involved in healthcare.
[03:56:42.019 --> 03:56:42.700]  Okay?
[03:56:42.700 --> 03:56:45.560]  It's unconstitutional, up one side and down the other.
[03:56:45.560 --> 03:56:47.521]  It was written by the insurance companies, man.
[03:56:48.390 --> 03:56:51.694]  No, I understand they haven't been done, but they're doing it through the Commerce Clause.
[03:56:51.694 --> 03:56:53.956]  It was the Commerce Committee... Hey, hey, let me stop you!
[03:56:53.956 --> 03:57:07.791]  The Commerce Clause of the federal government was in Texas News last week, had a girl kicked out of school for a week, a third grader, seven years old, for a jolly rancher in her lunch pail, and the federal government told the state of Texas, no candy,
[03:57:08.231 --> 03:57:10.133]  Kids can't have one piece of candy.
[03:57:10.133 --> 03:57:14.916]  The federal government under the Commerce Clause has no business what guns I own.
[03:57:14.916 --> 03:57:16.858]  It has no business what I do with my property.
[03:57:16.858 --> 03:57:20.521]  It has no business if my daughter has a stinking jolly rancher.
[03:57:20.521 --> 03:57:23.123]  Mike, man, just, oh, I'm going to let you go.
[03:57:23.123 --> 03:57:24.564]  You can call back later for a bigger debate.
[03:57:24.564 --> 03:57:25.485]  We're almost out of time.
[03:57:25.485 --> 03:57:26.906]  Gary Franchi comments on that.
[03:57:26.906 --> 03:57:29.088]  I mean, the guy's not even an American.
[03:57:29.848 --> 03:57:37.111]  The Commerce Clause is what the federal government uses as their excuse to reign in the states whenever they feel like it.
[03:57:37.111 --> 03:57:39.912]  We cover that exclusively in this film.
[03:57:39.912 --> 03:57:41.372]  Exclusively.
[03:57:41.372 --> 03:57:44.253]  In fact, that's how the back cover starts out, getting into the Commerce Clause.
[03:57:44.253 --> 03:57:54.917]  I mean, look, if they can tell kids they can't have a Jolly Rancher, or through the Commerce Clause, or the McDonald's can't give people Happy Meal toys... That's not what the founders intended, Alex.
[03:57:54.917 --> 03:57:56.258]  That's not what the founders intended.
[03:57:57.093 --> 03:58:01.234]  You know, they just didn't want terrorists to trade between the states.
[03:58:01.234 --> 03:58:04.175]  You know, that's what they... They didn't want that!
[03:58:04.175 --> 03:58:08.156]  And they're not gonna... Regulating the firearms and Jolly Ranchers?
[03:58:08.156 --> 03:58:08.836]  This is news to me.
[03:58:08.836 --> 03:58:10.377]  That's just absolutely ludicrous.
[03:58:10.377 --> 03:58:14.078]  Oh no, the state of Texas was told by the Commerce Department no Jolly Ranchers.
[03:58:14.078 --> 03:58:15.058]  That was mainstream news.
[03:58:15.598 --> 03:58:16.259]  Gary, stay there.
[03:58:16.259 --> 03:58:20.082]  I want to talk to you at the end of the show, my friend, about some exciting things we're working on together.
[03:58:20.082 --> 03:58:21.383]  Great job, but don't tread on me.
[03:58:21.383 --> 03:58:22.163]  Rise of the Republic.
[03:58:22.163 --> 03:58:23.584]  Folks, make the film a hit.
[03:58:23.584 --> 03:58:24.885]  Get it at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:24.885 --> 03:58:27.588]  Get Burmese's great film, Invisible Empire.
[03:58:27.588 --> 03:58:31.631]  Wake people up to the New World Order so they know the enemy, and this gives you the solution.
[03:58:31.631 --> 03:58:32.391]  God bless you all.
[03:58:32.391 --> 03:58:34.033]  It's all available at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:34.033 --> 03:58:34.653]  Great job, crew.
[03:58:34.653 --> 03:58:35.714]  Back live tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[03:58:35.714 --> 03:58:36.274]  Central.
[03:58:36.274 --> 03:58:37.595]  Retransmission starts now.
[03:58:37.595 --> 03:58:38.196]  Stay with us.
[03:58:38.196 --> 03:58:39.117]  Max Keiser, coming up.
[03:58:43.928 --> 03:58:46.412]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:46.412 --> 03:58:48.736]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today!
[03:58:52.799 --> 03:58:56.461]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[03:58:56.461 --> 03:58:57.722]  Tyranny is here.
[03:58:57.722 --> 03:59:01.464]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:59:01.464 --> 03:59:03.885]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:59:03.885 --> 03:59:09.768]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[03:59:09.768 --> 03:59:15.992]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[03:59:16.432 --> 03:59:22.394]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:59:22.394 --> 03:59:26.575]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[03:59:26.575 --> 03:59:30.856]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:59:30.856 --> 03:59:36.798]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:59:36.798 --> 03:59:40.359]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:59:40.359 --> 03:59:42.340]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:59:42.340 --> 03:59:42.780]  It's here.
