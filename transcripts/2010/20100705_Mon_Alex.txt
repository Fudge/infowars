[00:00:01.587 --> 00:00:03.787]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:00:04.368 --> 00:00:07.388]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:18.190]  Okay, the last two hours of this July 5th, 2010 Monday edition are simulcasting right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:30.513]  We're going to have wide open phones throughout the next two hours and we're going to cover a ton of news like Dow repeats Great Depression pattern.
[00:00:32.227 --> 00:00:33.648]  That's what we've been telling you for two years.
[00:00:34.608 --> 00:00:38.730]  It took them two to three years to admit they were in a depression in 1929 and 1933.
[00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.812]  The same bankers ran that scam.
[00:00:43.612 --> 00:00:44.673]  So we're going to break that down.
[00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.053]  Also, with the U.S.
[00:00:46.073 --> 00:00:48.875]  trapped in depression, this really is starting to feel like 1932.
[00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:50.976]  London Telegraph.
[00:00:50.996 --> 00:00:52.736]  You know about the New York Times last week.
[00:00:52.836 --> 00:00:53.737]  The third depression.
[00:00:55.037 --> 00:00:58.039]  Why are they suddenly all reporting the truth?
[00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:06.282]  The truth so far, so far as, yeah, we're really in a depression, but not who's behind it, how do we get out of it?
[00:01:06.902 --> 00:01:11.023]  How do we bring those behind it to justice so that they don't keep doing it in the future?
[00:01:13.724 --> 00:01:18.565]  I'm going to go to your calls, but I want to just say this simply and succinctly right now, and I'm going to get back into it later.
[00:01:19.305 --> 00:01:21.605]  It isn't enough to throw out every incumbent.
[00:01:23.465 --> 00:01:25.566]  It isn't enough to just
[00:01:27.234 --> 00:01:32.657]  Educate yourself on the fact that there is a world government and there are offshore private banks that are robbing us.
[00:01:33.438 --> 00:01:42.523]  People have to also really grow up and face the facts, even if it is horrifying, that the controllers of this planet are eugenicists.
[00:01:43.944 --> 00:01:50.408]  And that they are poisoning our water and our food and our air by design
[00:01:52.355 --> 00:01:59.124]  to introduce chemicals and toxins into our food chain that will lower
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:15.209]  Our standard of living, our quality of life, that will cause degenerative diseases that they can then make money off of treating them in the future, and that will ultimately basically sterilize the majority of the population.
[00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.672]  This is their stated goal, and this is clearly what they are doing.
[00:02:20.112 --> 00:02:22.354]  All right, let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[00:02:22.794 --> 00:02:24.275]  Let's talk to Brian in Tennessee.
[00:02:24.335 --> 00:02:24.895]  Go ahead, Brian.
[00:02:24.915 --> 00:02:25.436]  Thanks for holding.
[00:02:26.618 --> 00:02:27.038]  Hey, Alex.
[00:02:27.058 --> 00:02:27.658]  How's it going, buddy?
[00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:28.279]  Good, sir.
[00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:34.701]  I just wanted to... I don't have any information about the Gulf, but I have something important.
[00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:41.344]  I want to talk to you about the Patriot Act, which will definitely come into effect if they start evacuating millions of people and seizing guns.
[00:02:42.004 --> 00:02:43.184]  Yesterday, I was laying in bed.
[00:02:43.204 --> 00:02:47.726]  I was reading the Constitution, and I couldn't believe it.
[00:02:48.066 --> 00:02:54.729]  My jaw about fell out when I was reading the 10th Amendment, and then I looked at the 9th Amendment,
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:05.165]  And it just suddenly dawned on me that the Patriot Act is no more genuine than a $3 bill.
[00:03:06.025 --> 00:03:19.752]  And that the only reason that the thing can exist is because most of the American people are ignorant of their rights in the Constitution, and they're intimidated, and they don't question anything.
[00:03:20.173 --> 00:03:22.474]  But on its own legs, it's not a valid law.
[00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:31.421]  For instance, in the Fourth Amendment, you know, it talks about how you can't have any unlawful searches and seizures.
[00:03:32.041 --> 00:03:38.623]  And the Patriot Act obviously extends more of that to the government, to where they can come into your house.
[00:03:38.903 --> 00:03:44.764]  And the system lied and said that sneak and peek and all the rest of that wouldn't be used on citizens.
[00:03:45.264 --> 00:03:48.185]  And it has been, and now they use it in regular law enforcement.
[00:03:49.085 --> 00:03:51.826]  Absolutely, it was written for the American people.
[00:03:52.666 --> 00:03:59.135]  And the Patriot Act conservatively nullifies five of the ten articles in the Bill of Rights.
[00:04:00.151 --> 00:04:03.652]  But it says plainly, here's the thing, this is what's so crazy.
[00:04:03.992 --> 00:04:15.816]  It says in the Ninth Amendment, the enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.
[00:04:16.136 --> 00:04:21.638]  So you cannot take any of the rights in the Constitution from the people.
[00:04:22.658 --> 00:04:24.939]  It's there in plain black and white in the Ninth Amendment.
[00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:27.920]  Yes, the Ninth Amendment is probably the most important amendment there.
[00:04:29.634 --> 00:04:46.771]  And the 10th Amendment just further expounds on it and says the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people.
[00:04:47.446 --> 00:04:49.489]  So, I mean, I don't understand.
[00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:50.930]  It's so cut and dry.
[00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.933]  How can we listen?
[00:04:53.013 --> 00:04:57.839]  Listen, it's cut and dry that the government can't just say we'll kill U.S.
[00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:06.449]  citizens anywhere we want in the United States or worldwide if someone in the Pentagon or White House thinks they might be a terrorist.
[00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.771]  And people say, well, we've got to get tough on the terrorists.
[00:05:09.791 --> 00:05:11.571]  Then you go research who the terrorists are.
[00:05:12.171 --> 00:05:17.013]  Ninety-nine percent of the time, literally, it is a staged government event.
[00:05:17.573 --> 00:05:23.835]  And of course you don't let the government just arrest and take away anybody they want to a dungeon.
[00:05:23.855 --> 00:05:35.518]  I mean, of course that's the greatest threat, not some turbaned guy who wants to blow up a school, even if that turbaned guy actually exists, which in most cases they don't.
[00:05:36.298 --> 00:05:39.801]  There is some real Muslim terrorist out there from the research I've done.
[00:05:40.321 --> 00:05:43.063]  But most of it is government.
[00:05:43.364 --> 00:05:48.187]  And most of the real stuff is basically copycat from the government stuff.
[00:05:48.287 --> 00:05:52.451]  And this is an elementary statement you're making, Brian, but it's also very profound.
[00:05:53.111 --> 00:05:55.012]  That's why I'm dumbfounded so much.
[00:05:56.033 --> 00:05:57.755]  This is openly treason.
[00:05:58.075 --> 00:06:00.176]  It is openly criminal.
[00:06:00.857 --> 00:06:03.339]  But the government knows they're doing that.
[00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:05.501]  I mean, listen, having the military
[00:06:06.502 --> 00:06:08.844]  Running checkpoints all over the country with local police.
[00:06:09.604 --> 00:06:12.066]  And training with foreign troops to take on the American people.
[00:06:12.426 --> 00:06:16.869]  And the federal government secretly training tens of thousands of preachers, now on record.
[00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.651]  This was secret when we first reported it.
[00:06:19.691 --> 00:06:25.595]  Now it's, oh yes, the government's working secretly with preachers to prepare their flocks to go to FEMA camps.
[00:06:25.916 --> 00:06:27.236]  I mean, how creepy is that?
[00:06:27.617 --> 00:06:29.698]  If you go watch The Running Man from the mid-1980s,
[00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:32.560]  It's like, where's my brother?
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.300]  Oh, he was permanently detained.
[00:06:35.101 --> 00:06:46.786]  You go watch Firefox, like I said in the first hour with Clint Eastwood, from the late 1970s, and he goes to visit Russia, and they search his bags, and he's shocked by the incredible police state.
[00:06:47.066 --> 00:06:51.188]  I mean, again, we are living in the Soviet Union.
[00:06:51.748 --> 00:06:53.849]  And so, secret arrest is being promoted.
[00:06:54.935 --> 00:06:56.817]  Shutting down free speech is being promoted.
[00:06:57.638 --> 00:06:59.120]  Taking everybody's bank accounts.
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.842]  Not giving people money.
[00:07:01.362 --> 00:07:04.907]  In the last week, I've seen all these mainstream media reports put it out there.
[00:07:05.507 --> 00:07:11.454]  Oh, I guess the health care bill didn't cover pre-existing conditions and those with really bad conditions.
[00:07:11.634 --> 00:07:14.758]  Oh, it does cut your benefits and raise your taxes.
[00:07:15.899 --> 00:07:22.828]  And see, they don't care if you find out Obama's a liar, and his approval rating, you know, drops, like the approval rating of gonorrhea.
[00:07:23.268 --> 00:07:24.971]  Because they'll just put a new puppet in.
[00:07:25.731 --> 00:07:33.681]  This was all meant to happen, all, and the whole fake debate, I mean, and to see our fellow Americans buying this hook, line, and sinker.
[00:07:33.922 --> 00:07:34.663]  Anything else, Brian?
[00:07:35.737 --> 00:07:36.198]  Yes, sir.
[00:07:37.138 --> 00:07:54.028]  My frustration is much like yours, but it seems to me, I mean, am I wrong in saying that the power from these so-called laws and acts, like the Patriot Act, they get their power from the ignorance of the 99% of the American people?
[00:07:54.348 --> 00:08:04.314]  In other words, if 300 million Americans realized the 9th and 10th Amendments and what they meant, that the Patriot Act would simply just fall apart like a house of cards?
[00:08:04.534 --> 00:08:04.955]  Exactly.
[00:08:04.995 --> 00:08:05.896]  I appreciate your call.
[00:08:05.956 --> 00:08:12.005]  That's why I had the idea and threw it out over eight years ago on air and then others picked it up and ran with it.
[00:08:12.866 --> 00:08:14.128]  And that's the power of this show.
[00:08:14.489 --> 00:08:16.752]  We have great guests with really great ideas.
[00:08:16.792 --> 00:08:19.777]  We have wonderful callers with just amazing ideas.
[00:08:21.943 --> 00:08:32.076]  And if any one of you out there can just implement these ideas in your town, in your city, in your state, then it is a model for the rest of the country and the world.
[00:08:32.657 --> 00:08:34.880]  That's why they're so scared of anyone standing up.
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.942]  That's why they want to make you feel powerless.
[00:08:38.157 --> 00:08:46.441]  And I had the idea of having the states, via the 9th and 10th Amendment, nullify the Patriot Act, and we couldn't get that done, so I said, how about counties and cities?
[00:08:47.182 --> 00:08:57.887]  And then other people picked up the idea, and over 800 cities and four states passed laws against the Patriot Act, and we stood up and said, no, this is unconstitutional.
[00:08:58.387 --> 00:09:03.130]  Then that gave moral support to courts, who've stood up and said it's unconstitutional.
[00:09:04.665 --> 00:09:05.005]  Okay.
[00:09:05.906 --> 00:09:07.307]  And so it's always a struggle.
[00:09:07.367 --> 00:09:09.429]  The tyrant's always wanting your freedoms.
[00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:14.012]  And you're always having to stand up and secure those freedoms.
[00:09:15.133 --> 00:09:16.815]  Let's go ahead and talk.
[00:09:17.115 --> 00:09:19.277]  I mean, what does the Bill of Rights talk about?
[00:09:19.517 --> 00:09:21.779]  Well, we've gotten our country, we've gotten our Constitution.
[00:09:22.099 --> 00:09:24.521]  Now we need to secure that with this Bill of Rights.
[00:09:27.537 --> 00:09:29.518]  I mean, do you lock your house when you go out of town?
[00:09:29.558 --> 00:09:30.178]  Do you secure?
[00:09:30.198 --> 00:09:34.160]  Do you put your child in a safety seat in a car to try to secure them?
[00:09:35.441 --> 00:09:40.144]  Do you stop smoking cigarettes so you secure that you won't die of lung cancer?
[00:09:42.085 --> 00:09:45.927]  Again, you can't just go to the bar every day after work and get drunk and be free.
[00:09:46.167 --> 00:09:50.669]  There are crooks who will take over government that has the power to rob your butt.
[00:09:51.209 --> 00:09:52.530]  Let's go to Eric in California.
[00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:53.291]  You're on the air, Eric.
[00:09:55.091 --> 00:09:55.392]  Hey, Alex.
[00:09:55.772 --> 00:09:56.072]  Hey, buddy.
[00:09:57.188 --> 00:10:06.771]  Hey, long-time listener, sometime contributor, not a Prison Planet member, but I do buy every one of your videos, and I do support your sponsors.
[00:10:07.311 --> 00:10:07.691]  Thank you.
[00:10:07.871 --> 00:10:19.474]  One of which, one of which, I guess it's James, and let me just tell you, after being a lifelong Levi's wearer, my boys couldn't be happier, if you know what I mean.
[00:10:19.634 --> 00:10:20.854]  The kinkies are comfortable.
[00:10:21.294 --> 00:10:23.015]  Okay, so what else is on your mind, sir?
[00:10:24.133 --> 00:10:30.014]  Hey, buddy, I was just awoken this morning, July 5th, 2010, to a police helicopter.
[00:10:30.634 --> 00:10:37.896]  And very untypically of this area, they were on the loudspeaker giving the description of an armed robbery suspect.
[00:10:38.556 --> 00:10:45.378]  But what it did is it made me, it finally dawned on me how badly the police state needs us.
[00:10:47.178 --> 00:10:51.599]  And let me just preface that by saying back when the legal immigration
[00:10:52.679 --> 00:10:56.121]  Movement first started and there was those big demonstrations in L.A.
[00:10:56.141 --> 00:10:57.242]  Do you remember those?
[00:10:57.262 --> 00:10:58.803]  I don't remember the year of that.
[00:11:00.684 --> 00:11:03.346]  Do you remember when there was like 500,000 marching through L.A.
[00:11:03.366 --> 00:11:10.030]  and then we had the May 1st demonstration shortly after that?
[00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:11.111]  That's when I got involved.
[00:11:11.491 --> 00:11:20.517]  Well, in my town, my town was one of few that got reported of any incidences of violence from the illegal immigrant population.
[00:11:21.281 --> 00:11:25.184]  And in my town what they had to do is they had to pull from all different counties.
[00:11:26.025 --> 00:11:32.391]  They had to gather up about 400 goons, enforcers, to quell the riot.
[00:11:34.552 --> 00:11:36.254]  I'll come back and finish up.
[00:11:36.274 --> 00:11:48.524]  Yeah, finish up your point and then we'll continue but I'm going to try to finish up this caller quickly and then a few others because I really... We're two and a half hours in here ladies and gentlemen and I need to... I've covered quite a bit of news but not as much as I want to.
[00:11:48.544 --> 00:11:49.145]  I want to get into
[00:11:51.755 --> 00:11:57.264]  The fact that the media is now admitting we're in a depression and that our country is going to collapse.
[00:12:00.558 --> 00:12:04.801]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:12:05.101 --> 00:12:05.381]  Number 1.
[00:12:06.021 --> 00:12:09.163]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:12:09.444 --> 00:12:10.004]  Number 2.
[00:12:10.304 --> 00:12:14.867]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:12:15.207 --> 00:12:15.648]  It's true.
[00:12:15.948 --> 00:12:20.511]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:12:20.811 --> 00:12:21.351]  Number 3.
[00:12:21.651 --> 00:12:24.933]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:12:25.234 --> 00:12:28.936]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:12:29.136 --> 00:12:29.676]  Number 4.
[00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:32.278]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:12:32.678 --> 00:12:36.060]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:36.580]  Number 5.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:41.082]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:12:41.302 --> 00:12:46.065]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:12:46.365 --> 00:12:50.392]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:12:50.532 --> 00:12:52.095]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:12:52.315 --> 00:12:54.378]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[00:13:00.509 --> 00:13:03.010]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnabel from Midas Resources.
[00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:09.292]  It is becoming painfully obvious the Washington bailout is running out of steam and the economy is showing signs of a double-dip recession.
[00:13:09.592 --> 00:13:14.554]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation will be a direct result of the spending policy.
[00:13:14.674 --> 00:13:17.195]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[00:13:17.415 --> 00:13:19.936]  Are a majority of your assets tied up in the stock or bond market?
[00:13:20.136 --> 00:13:23.017]  If so, are those assets working for you or against you?
[00:13:23.277 --> 00:13:30.060]  One thing is certain, having physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what happens to our economy or the dollar, your investment will not
[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:30.300]  I think so.
[00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:07.565]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[00:14:08.286 --> 00:14:12.729]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.

[00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:05.711]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[00:15:05.831 --> 00:15:08.472]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[00:15:08.573 --> 00:15:10.534]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[00:15:10.814 --> 00:15:11.994]  Okay, here it comes.

[00:15:14.116 --> 00:15:15.837]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[00:15:16.057 --> 00:15:17.758]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[00:15:18.038 --> 00:15:21.520]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:29.124]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.

[00:15:51.649 --> 00:15:52.049]  It works!
[00:16:05.279 --> 00:16:07.620]  Okay, Eric in California, finish up your point.
[00:16:09.981 --> 00:16:23.187]  Yeah, well like I was saying, there was a small riot as soon as it got dark down here in my town and they had to pull in resources from all the different cities throughout my particular county.
[00:16:23.747 --> 00:16:26.988]  My point being is the police state needs us.
[00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:33.031]  They need us to participate and
[00:16:34.173 --> 00:16:35.494]  I'll tie this in with this.
[00:16:36.235 --> 00:16:42.159]  What's the big argument for cracking down on illegal aliens, you know, like what they're proposing to do in Arizona?
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:47.964]  Their big argument is, well, the Hispanic community won't trust the police and therefore they won't help us fight crime.
[00:16:49.045 --> 00:16:51.667]  Another example of what I'm saying.
[00:16:52.147 --> 00:16:55.570]  They need us for this police state.
[00:16:56.931 --> 00:16:58.552]  Hi, Harry, and I appreciate your call.
[00:16:58.933 --> 00:17:00.494]  Those are really good points that you've made.
[00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:06.333]  The problem is people need to have their own judgment.
[00:17:07.214 --> 00:17:11.819]  If the police are asking for your help to find a missing child, that's a good thing.
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.364]  Or if they're asking for your help to go fight a forest fire, you should saddle up and do it.
[00:17:17.486 --> 00:17:29.590]  But through an emergency alert system that is to find missing children, now it's got anti-gun messages and just random messages about spying on your neighbor.
[00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:36.232]  So they always use something that sounds reasonable to then push a complete takeover of society.
[00:17:36.852 --> 00:17:43.654]  You'll also notice that the IRS will visit a Sacramento car cleaner
[00:17:45.609 --> 00:17:57.835]  Car wash for a four cent unpaid ticket or four cent unpaid bill and Send armed officers not once but twice Threatening to arrest them if they didn't pay the four cents.
[00:17:58.496 --> 00:18:08.080]  They hadn't even sent him a letter But see that's how they waste resources those on top know how to deploy them Where they never actually stop any real crime.
[00:18:08.401 --> 00:18:13.023]  I mean, I mean here's an article interpol asked web servers to catch fugitives and
[00:18:14.457 --> 00:18:26.107]  Interpol has been caught in Europe with DynCorp, with Halliburton, with the UN, all over Eastern Europe, running the child kidnapping and the international prostitution.
[00:18:26.427 --> 00:18:29.069]  I mean, that's come out in government document after government document.
[00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:32.372]  Just Google, UN caught kidnapping women and children in Europe.
[00:18:32.773 --> 00:18:34.474]  You'll get BBC, you name it.
[00:18:34.774 --> 00:18:38.678]  And then read, Interpol comes up time and time again in there.
[00:18:40.519 --> 00:18:51.247]  It says, International Police Agency Interpol on Monday urged internet users to help track down hundreds of fugitives wanted for murder, rape and sexual child abuse and other serious crimes.
[00:18:51.267 --> 00:18:54.450]  Well, why don't they go arrest some of the people in their own department?
[00:18:56.291 --> 00:19:00.294]  Again, Interpol is the federal police of every nation in Europe.
[00:19:00.995 --> 00:19:08.020]  And when you go to a hotel, this has been going on for 30 years or more, in Europe you are registered into the Interpol system.
[00:19:08.401 --> 00:19:09.982]  Everywhere you go is being watched.
[00:19:11.055 --> 00:19:16.021]  But this is done so the criminals that run the society can be protected.
[00:19:17.203 --> 00:19:24.072]  Let's say one of these criminals ripped you off or killed your wife, and you're going to go to that European country next door to you.
[00:19:24.112 --> 00:19:24.973]  Say you're in Spain.
[00:19:25.313 --> 00:19:26.274]  You're going to go to Portugal.
[00:19:27.225 --> 00:19:37.132]  And this happens all the time, and they have a computer system that statistically will know, okay, this guy from Spain is coming to Portugal.
[00:19:37.712 --> 00:19:45.317]  Our actuaries, our analysis shows there's a 79% chance he's planning to do harm to this fellow that lives in Portugal.
[00:19:46.038 --> 00:19:56.044]  And they see you going from your city 500 miles away to a particular city in Portugal, and then when you get off the airplane, or when you pull into your hotel, an hour later,
[00:19:57.245 --> 00:19:58.487]  There's a knock on your door.
[00:19:58.507 --> 00:19:59.688]  Why are you here?
[00:19:59.789 --> 00:20:00.870]  Why are you in Portugal?
[00:20:01.651 --> 00:20:07.098]  And so, Interpol is mainly to make sure these globalists can commit their crimes and get away with it.
[00:20:07.118 --> 00:20:08.420]  I mean, large portions.
[00:20:08.961 --> 00:20:10.222]  This has come out of a news report.
[00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:17.552]  And some have been caught of the European elite are openly Satanists and are openly pedophiles.
[00:20:17.632 --> 00:20:21.894]  It's you don't get in the club like a lot of Republican congressmen, you've got to be gay.
[00:20:22.715 --> 00:20:23.755]  That's kind of the club here.
[00:20:25.076 --> 00:20:28.717]  Or with Democrats, it's always been in for some reason to rape women.
[00:20:28.937 --> 00:20:31.198]  I don't know why, but it just keeps coming up.
[00:20:31.679 --> 00:20:32.639]  That's kind of the club.
[00:20:32.719 --> 00:20:33.960]  They like to slap women around.
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.061]  Bill Clinton likes to bite them while he rapes them, to hold them down.
[00:20:37.101 --> 00:20:40.663]  He bites them on the lips like a bulldog bites a bull.
[00:20:42.104 --> 00:20:43.044]  But that's what they do.
[00:20:43.284 --> 00:20:45.786]  And in Europe, it's pedophile run.
[00:20:46.687 --> 00:20:50.529]  And so anybody trying to get justice, Interpol is there to protect the pedophiles, period.
[00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:55.693]  And see, if you really want freedom, folks, you're going to have to actually go research what I said and find out.
[00:20:56.033 --> 00:20:57.994]  I didn't just say that to be shocking, okay?
[00:20:58.315 --> 00:20:59.155]  That's actually true.
[00:21:00.236 --> 00:21:00.576]  Okay?
[00:21:00.696 --> 00:21:03.618]  And 15 years of deep research, it's just everywhere.
[00:21:04.239 --> 00:21:06.801]  You could find that out in five minutes just doing a search about it.
[00:21:08.121 --> 00:21:08.302]  But...
[00:21:11.837 --> 00:21:16.079]  Here's what I'm going to do, okay, because I keep saying I'm going to get to the news and then I don't.
[00:21:17.219 --> 00:21:28.143]  We're going to come back from break and I'm going to give each caller about a minute and a half, plus they've been holding, clear out this phone board and then I'm going to get to all this news instead of just eating around the edges.
[00:21:28.163 --> 00:21:30.704]  Those are so much.
[00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:34.205]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:21:34.225 --> 00:21:36.966]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:21:38.669 --> 00:21:39.409]  Study history.
[00:21:39.989 --> 00:21:43.490]  When good people lay around and become decadent, the worst elements take over.
[00:21:44.551 --> 00:21:44.851]  Okay?
[00:21:45.331 --> 00:21:45.911]  We'll be right back.
[00:21:50.672 --> 00:21:51.592]  We're on the march.
[00:21:52.073 --> 00:21:53.673]  The empire's on the run.

[00:22:59.653 --> 00:23:03.876]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:23:04.196 --> 00:23:04.797]  Number 1.
[00:23:05.117 --> 00:23:08.279]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:09.100]  Number 2.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:13.964]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:23:14.284 --> 00:23:14.744]  It's true.
[00:23:15.044 --> 00:23:19.588]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:23:19.908 --> 00:23:20.448]  Number 3.
[00:23:20.729 --> 00:23:24.011]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:23:24.311 --> 00:23:28.014]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:23:28.214 --> 00:23:28.774]  Number 4.
[00:23:29.015 --> 00:23:31.376]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:23:31.777 --> 00:23:35.159]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:35.660]  Number 5.
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:40.163]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:23:40.403 --> 00:23:45.147]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:09.764]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:24:10.144 --> 00:24:17.229]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:24:17.529 --> 00:24:22.072]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:24:35.318 --> 00:24:41.460]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:45.422]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[00:24:50.384 --> 00:24:51.044]  Thank you!
[00:24:51.405 --> 00:24:51.485]  Ha!
[00:24:51.525 --> 00:24:52.585]  We are back live!
[00:24:52.925 --> 00:24:55.887]  We need to get fired up for freedom!
[00:24:55.927 --> 00:24:57.968]  We need to defend the republic!
[00:25:14.264 --> 00:25:18.845]  We need to stay focused every day and realize this is a life and death situation.
[00:25:19.265 --> 00:25:22.406]  Not just for our own individual lives, but for the life of free humanity.
[00:25:23.466 --> 00:25:25.747]  Laura in Iowa, you're on the air, welcome.
[00:25:26.847 --> 00:25:30.608]  Hi Alex, I've been listening to you for 15 years, no kidding.
[00:25:30.888 --> 00:25:31.428]  Wow.
[00:25:32.288 --> 00:25:38.130]  Yeah, I've been listening to you since you first came out and what I want to say is that why don't we
[00:25:38.806 --> 00:25:43.368]  Separate, form our own colonies, join together, take America back.
[00:25:43.488 --> 00:25:44.749]  Take what's ours back.
[00:25:45.329 --> 00:25:49.772]  Why are we going to just sit here and wait until the UN kicks in our door and hauls us off to a remake?
[00:25:49.792 --> 00:25:51.393]  Well, where are we going to start a colony?
[00:25:51.733 --> 00:25:52.973]  How are we going to fund the colony?
[00:25:53.314 --> 00:26:01.338]  How are we going to stop secret agents from coming in to our colony that's open and infiltrating it and committing crimes and blaming it on us?
[00:26:01.378 --> 00:26:05.440]  I mean, they are openly setting up the secret police model all over the Western world.
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:15.905]  They have secret police now grabbing US, Canadian and British citizens and putting bags over their heads on TV to send the message of, we will snatch you, we will grab you.
[00:26:16.145 --> 00:26:23.989]  Those cops are being trained to snatch and grab and then now openly take someone to a dungeon to be tortured and never seen again.
[00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:28.692]  They're actually promoting that on the news and they've started the snatching and grabbing part.
[00:26:29.692 --> 00:26:31.132]  And they're telling us torture's good.
[00:26:31.632 --> 00:26:50.216]  So, I mean, I'm not trying to poo-poo your idea, and it's kind of like the Free State Project, people moving to New Hampshire, and I'm all for people forming little communities, but now they're harassing the Amish, using environmental rules to try to take their kids and take their land.
[00:26:50.276 --> 00:26:54.397]  I mean, I agree with you, that's a logical thing to do.
[00:26:54.797 --> 00:26:57.618]  The problem is, there's nowhere to go.
[00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:00.861]  Wow.
[00:27:01.802 --> 00:27:02.764]  It just sickens me.
[00:27:02.804 --> 00:27:03.446]  I'm like you.
[00:27:03.546 --> 00:27:05.109]  I'm up at night.
[00:27:05.249 --> 00:27:06.311]  I'm pacing around.
[00:27:06.331 --> 00:27:06.672]  I just...
[00:27:07.341 --> 00:27:08.262]  I'm just sick of it.
[00:27:08.322 --> 00:27:12.204]  I'm sick of them stripping away our freedoms.
[00:27:12.324 --> 00:27:12.945]  I'm just tired of it.
[00:27:38.482 --> 00:27:41.405]  I just want to say that I highly respect you.
[00:27:41.485 --> 00:27:50.253]  I've been on your side for many years and I've been on America's side even longer and I just know that we will win in the end and hang in there.
[00:27:50.293 --> 00:27:50.913]  Don't give up.
[00:27:50.973 --> 00:27:53.796]  I know you're discouraged because I can hear it sometimes in your voice.
[00:27:53.856 --> 00:27:56.458]  I get that way too, but God bless America.
[00:27:56.518 --> 00:27:57.239]  Let's get her back.
[00:27:57.959 --> 00:27:58.880]  Laura, thank you.
[00:27:59.261 --> 00:28:01.643]  You know, it's not that I'm discouraged.
[00:28:05.689 --> 00:28:23.673]  I'm intellectually pleased that we're gaining so much headway but now I realize that the battle is joined and that the system is now taking our resistance serious and I'm just every day more and more dumbfounded by how real this is.
[00:28:24.954 --> 00:28:34.856]  You want to think more of your fellow man and to just have everything we ever covered confirmed in triplicate
[00:28:36.064 --> 00:28:37.344]  It's not a good feeling.
[00:28:38.685 --> 00:28:40.085]  I'm not happy I'm right.
[00:28:41.285 --> 00:28:42.365]  I wish I was a kook.
[00:28:42.465 --> 00:28:44.166]  I wish I was a conspiracy theorist.
[00:28:45.006 --> 00:28:49.767]  And I see people on the YouTube comment boards and I see them on InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[00:28:50.467 --> 00:29:01.469]  You know, I made a video Friday about the economic implosion that's happening and how it's by design and
[00:29:02.694 --> 00:29:06.217]  It was emergency SOS, America being taken over by offshore banks.
[00:29:07.879 --> 00:29:13.123]  And I saw about half the people commenting going, oh shut up conspiracy theorists, none of this is happening.
[00:29:13.624 --> 00:29:14.725]  There's no problem.
[00:29:15.486 --> 00:29:17.027]  You're trash, you're scum.
[00:29:18.488 --> 00:29:21.131]  They don't even have self-preservation instincts.
[00:29:21.191 --> 00:29:25.955]  I mean, everything I said in that 15 minute video that's had over 100,000 views,
[00:29:28.681 --> 00:29:36.766]  Is on the record now, world government, the UN wanting to scrap the dollar for a global SDR, private banks ruling us.
[00:29:37.467 --> 00:29:38.867]  I mean, I live in a republic.
[00:29:39.027 --> 00:29:39.888]  I rule myself.
[00:29:40.628 --> 00:29:41.869]  I am the sovereign.
[00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:46.512]  My ancestors, like your ancestors, created this country.
[00:29:46.992 --> 00:29:56.038]  And it's not perfect, but it's a lot better than some offshore swindlers who call themselves banks, this criminal ruling class, dominating me.
[00:29:56.098 --> 00:29:57.439]  I mean, I don't like being conquered.
[00:29:59.022 --> 00:30:05.570]  I mean, these people really openly are on the news saying, we'll arrest any citizens we want and we'll torture them.
[00:30:06.011 --> 00:30:11.358]  And they're paying private contractors to throw bags over people's heads and throw them in vans all over the world.
[00:30:12.913 --> 00:30:22.937]  On the news, and the news reports it like it's, well, the police are letting private contractors arrest people, and it shows someone with a bag being thrown over their head and being drug into a car.
[00:30:23.277 --> 00:30:29.020]  That's being done to acclimate everyone, where cops and others just think it's normal.
[00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:33.302]  We're being lowered down into the acid right now.
[00:30:37.003 --> 00:30:40.965]  And it's gonna make people wake up, but, you know, I'm sitting there watching this
[00:30:43.527 --> 00:30:54.693]  This war, this battle being joined, and I'm in the fight, but I'm also in like a general's perspective looking at it, and I'm just like, why did this have to happen?
[00:30:55.993 --> 00:30:59.535]  And I see these masses of people who aren't awake, and I care about them.
[00:30:59.595 --> 00:31:00.116]  I love them.
[00:31:00.156 --> 00:31:01.116]  I want them to have freedom.
[00:31:01.156 --> 00:31:03.357]  I want them to control their own destiny.
[00:31:03.437 --> 00:31:08.940]  I want them to not be slaves, and they're laughing at me, and I don't even get angry at them.
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:10.321]  They're pathetic.
[00:31:11.121 --> 00:31:12.302]  It makes me feel sick.
[00:31:14.138 --> 00:31:19.443]  You ever seen somebody do something bad that you're friends with or somebody you know and it's like an embarrassed feeling?
[00:31:19.503 --> 00:31:20.404]  You feel embarrassed?
[00:31:20.684 --> 00:31:21.865]  I feel embarrassed.
[00:31:24.067 --> 00:31:27.430]  I guess overall that's, I just feel embarrassed how pathetic we are.
[00:31:28.527 --> 00:31:33.692]  But then also how great humans are and the art, the literature, the bravery, the ingenuity.
[00:31:34.353 --> 00:31:48.187]  I just love humanity so much and I know my children are part of humanity and I want them to grow up and to have a good future and I want my daughters to find good, loving, strong men who care about them and want to build them up.
[00:31:50.171 --> 00:31:52.733]  And I want my son to find a good woman to be his wife.
[00:31:52.973 --> 00:31:57.577]  And I do think about, my God, I brought children into this world.
[00:31:57.877 --> 00:32:01.260]  But if I had to do it over again, I would, because I can't give up.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.302]  But still, it freaks me out.
[00:32:03.402 --> 00:32:05.403]  I'm like, what in the world?
[00:32:06.925 --> 00:32:09.547]  Truth is so much stranger than fiction, as they say, and it's true.
[00:32:10.207 --> 00:32:12.109]  This is so bizarre.
[00:32:15.651 --> 00:32:17.353]  And it's all admitted.
[00:32:17.373 --> 00:32:18.314]  I mean, I knew
[00:32:20.522 --> 00:32:27.328]  In 1999, they were putting microphones up everywhere with the NSA listening for keywords and recording it.
[00:32:27.808 --> 00:32:32.152]  I found the documents, found the reports, but it's in the news today.
[00:32:32.232 --> 00:32:35.034]  It's all over the news that, hey, guess what?
[00:32:35.374 --> 00:32:39.458]  Microphones have been put up to record you in malls and on the street.
[00:32:40.683 --> 00:32:44.164]  and other places, and computers are going to be analyzing what you say.
[00:32:44.744 --> 00:32:59.129]  I mean, folks, they're admitting they ship in the drugs, they're admitting they run white slavery rings, they're admitting they got microphones listening to us, they're admitting they're arresting citizens and secretly detaining them and executing them before the law's even passed.
[00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:01.630]  I mean, this is bad!
[00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:03.571]  This is real bad!
[00:33:03.691 --> 00:33:04.211]  And, see,
[00:33:05.495 --> 00:33:07.415]  In the past, I thought, well, they haven't killed me.
[00:33:07.495 --> 00:33:11.956]  They have threatened me and other things, but because they don't want to underline and highlight everything I've said.
[00:33:14.237 --> 00:33:18.718]  But more than that, they just think so little of you that they think there's nothing you're going to do about it.
[00:33:19.358 --> 00:33:21.058]  Because you don't see yourselves as leaders.
[00:33:21.438 --> 00:33:23.559]  You don't see yourself in a role of standing up.
[00:33:23.599 --> 00:33:25.379]  You wouldn't know how to stand up, they think.
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:29.700]  Because you expect everything instantly, they think.
[00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:33.781]  They think that you're weak-minded and shallow and that they can do these things.
[00:33:34.915 --> 00:33:36.116]  Now they're starting to shift.
[00:33:36.136 --> 00:33:41.380]  They're starting to see that we've got a good chance of defeating them if people get a winning spirit.
[00:33:42.381 --> 00:33:46.185]  If people get a winning attitude and have the facts.
[00:33:47.906 --> 00:34:03.019]  If we're determined and they understand that I've got a lot of problems but I am determined and I've had a lot of success against the enemy and they know that people see that as a model of future success and so they are scared of us.
[00:34:04.804 --> 00:34:06.724]  Yeah, there's our story from what, four years ago?
[00:34:07.144 --> 00:34:11.065]  Government industry to use computer microphones to spy on 150 million Americans.
[00:34:11.805 --> 00:34:13.726]  That's from PrisonPlanet.com, September 6, 2006.
[00:34:15.346 --> 00:34:16.686]  By the way, where did that come from?
[00:34:17.447 --> 00:34:25.848]  Google put out a stinking press release, and I got called a kook by several newspapers for having Paul Watson write an article about it.
[00:34:28.189 --> 00:34:29.749]  And then now today, they come out and admit
[00:34:35.643 --> 00:34:42.669]  I mean, do I have to explain to people that the government listening to you inside your house without a warrant is tyranny?
[00:34:44.631 --> 00:34:56.101]  I mean, just four years ago, Bush was strutting around on television at press conferences saying, I am not spying on the American people.
[00:34:56.522 --> 00:34:58.784]  These warrantless wiretaps are only for Al-Qaeda.
[00:34:59.855 --> 00:35:10.820]  And then of course it came out that there were hundreds of thousands of them, literally different mass wiretaps listening to tens of millions of Americans randomly, and that they had premeditatedly lied.
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:11.680]  Of course they did!
[00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:14.721]  Bush had that big, you-know-what-eating grin on his face.
[00:35:14.761 --> 00:35:15.441]  He enjoys it.
[00:35:15.882 --> 00:35:16.762]  It's funny to him.
[00:35:17.162 --> 00:35:18.903]  Bush sees you as an animal.
[00:35:18.923 --> 00:35:19.743]  He's a psychopath.
[00:35:20.083 --> 00:35:21.344]  He sees you as a piece of meat.
[00:35:21.904 --> 00:35:28.647]  That's why he'll even wipe his glasses on Clinton's coat, or he'll be on Jay Leno, or on other shows.
[00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:37.634]  You know, before the show, a woman walks by to adjust somebody else's makeup and he'll grab their dress and clean his glasses.
[00:35:38.294 --> 00:35:40.436]  Because you're seen as a piece of tissue paper.
[00:35:41.456 --> 00:35:43.978]  He blows his snot into it and throws it in the trash.
[00:35:45.678 --> 00:35:54.443]  In fact, they found it so quickly.
[00:35:54.483 --> 00:35:57.185]  There he is, cleaning his glasses on her.
[00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:03.897]  And as soon as you get that, you know, people saying, that's not happening in America, that's a conspiracy theory.
[00:36:04.237 --> 00:36:13.789]  That is you literally in a trance under mind control, rationalizing whenever your face was something that threatens you and that scares you, you just say, that's not true.
[00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:15.051]  That's not true.
[00:36:15.071 --> 00:36:16.153]  That's not real.
[00:36:18.561 --> 00:36:19.662]  Look, it's real, okay?
[00:36:19.902 --> 00:36:22.544]  It's so much more real, I can't even describe it to you.
[00:36:23.284 --> 00:36:26.526]  And for all of you out there, and a lot of it's a snowball effect.
[00:36:27.007 --> 00:36:35.232]  They admittedly have government psychological warfare databases of certain phrases and terms that they have discovered are effective with weak-minded people.
[00:36:38.234 --> 00:36:39.415]  The Easily Influenced.
[00:36:39.635 --> 00:36:51.182]  And you'll see these comments on YouTube and everywhere else, and you can even click on their handles and go to their websites, and a lot of times they admit they're an army psyops, or they work for a big corporation in public relations.
[00:36:52.163 --> 00:36:59.087]  And they'll just come out and say, you know, none of this is true, you're a tinfoil hat wearer.
[00:36:59.748 --> 00:37:04.771]  And the simpler, the more mindless it is, the more effective it is.
[00:37:06.457 --> 00:37:09.059]  Until they're psychologically ready to roll out with it.
[00:37:09.079 --> 00:37:12.921]  They think you're acclimated and conditioned enough to go from, Alex is a crazy kook.
[00:37:13.242 --> 00:37:15.843]  There's no microphones put up in your town to listen to you.
[00:37:15.863 --> 00:37:22.868]  You know, this guy's a nut to, yeah, we've put him out for over a decade and we're also listening to you in your house.
[00:37:23.188 --> 00:37:23.969]  It's for your safety.
[00:37:25.106 --> 00:37:31.348]  And then those people that were saying I was a kook, they just go, well of course we need microphones listening to us.
[00:37:32.088 --> 00:37:35.129]  Or they still keep lying and saying there is no article.
[00:37:35.429 --> 00:37:39.671]  I could sit here on TV with all the articles where they're admittedly listening to you, worse than 1984.
[00:37:41.431 --> 00:37:46.556]  And it's done to target you, the good people, to know what you're up to and to know how to manipulate you.
[00:37:47.116 --> 00:37:57.066]  And it's known to see what economic decisions you're going to be making because they put it into these big aggregators to then make decisions on how to better rape you, how to better manipulate you financially.
[00:37:57.186 --> 00:37:57.907]  And they admit that.
[00:38:00.289 --> 00:38:04.313]  The biggest way the NSA operates is they'll see a trend for
[00:38:07.443 --> 00:38:18.490]  Say French Bulldogs five years ago, and they'll just give that information to a select board of corporations, and then those corporations can use that data however they want.
[00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:25.675]  If they want to put a French Bulldog on a lunchbox, knowing it'll sell easier, which gives them an unfair trade advantage.
[00:38:26.881 --> 00:38:34.744]  Or, the way one NSA guy described it to me, the NSA doesn't know why, but strawberries start getting real popular, and everything's strawberry, strawberry, strawberries.
[00:38:35.644 --> 00:38:37.345]  Then they know how to pre-position from that.
[00:38:37.925 --> 00:38:53.691]  They kind of boil it down in a simple way in V for Vendetta, where it shows these trucks driving around with dishes on the roofs, listening to what's happening in people's houses, which they actually really do have, with these acoustic microphones, and
[00:38:56.158 --> 00:39:08.185]  They go into the board meeting with the police, the FBI, and others, with the Big Brother fellow, and they say, uh, the positive mention is, uh, down, uh, to a record level, down to below 40%.
[00:39:10.186 --> 00:39:12.708]  And they say, that's it, we've got to move now, we're in deep trouble.
[00:39:13.068 --> 00:39:14.769]  Once it drops between 40, it's all over.
[00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:17.330]  They are actually listening to you in your house!
[00:39:18.499 --> 00:39:20.401]  They know what you really think of the government.
[00:39:20.441 --> 00:39:24.306]  They know the majority of you know 9-11's an inside job.
[00:39:24.626 --> 00:39:27.530]  They know many of you are waking up about the poison in the water.
[00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:30.413]  They know you're waking up about the bankers being criminals.
[00:39:30.794 --> 00:39:34.718]  They know the majority of you know that the oil leak's a staged event.
[00:39:35.706 --> 00:39:41.268]  Okay, they know, they know, they know that we really do have 4 million web visitors a week.
[00:39:41.728 --> 00:39:46.729]  They know we really do have between 2 to 5 million radio listeners a week, depending on which week.
[00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:48.810]  They know it's exponentially growing.
[00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:51.010]  They're going to start a war, folks.
[00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:52.591]  They're going to blow oil wells.
[00:39:52.611 --> 00:39:53.951]  They're going to stage crises.
[00:39:54.171 --> 00:39:56.692]  They're going to stage mass shootings and blame it on patriots.
[00:39:57.332 --> 00:39:59.893]  All in an attempt to shut you up to go along with this.
[00:40:07.236 --> 00:40:10.538]  See, there's no more denial for those of you out there that are childlike.
[00:40:11.319 --> 00:40:12.920]  The government is listening to you.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.441]  Google is the NSA.
[00:40:14.721 --> 00:40:18.504]  They are listening to you in your house and watching you with the camera built in.
[00:40:18.784 --> 00:40:20.745]  They are using your iPads, your iPhones.
[00:40:21.086 --> 00:40:24.188]  They are using all of the systems that are cell phone enabled.
[00:40:24.608 --> 00:40:26.489]  They are using everything to track you.
[00:40:26.569 --> 00:40:28.331]  It was designed to track you.
[00:40:29.071 --> 00:40:30.372]  They are completely criminal.
[00:40:30.752 --> 00:40:34.595]  If you're 38 years old or younger, they took your blood at birth.
[00:40:36.553 --> 00:40:38.575]  And put it in a bioweapons database.
[00:40:38.995 --> 00:40:41.297]  I told you this 15 years ago.
[00:40:41.357 --> 00:40:42.097]  It's now admitted.
[00:40:42.378 --> 00:40:43.658]  This isn't a joke.
[00:40:43.999 --> 00:40:46.080]  There isn't time to screw around.
[00:40:46.461 --> 00:40:47.381]  Listen, cops.
[00:40:47.782 --> 00:40:48.883]  Listen, military.
[00:40:49.203 --> 00:40:51.144]  You are being poisoned.
[00:40:51.825 --> 00:40:53.566]  You have got to choose sides.
[00:40:54.387 --> 00:40:55.327]  And there's no decision.
[00:40:55.448 --> 00:40:56.709]  You're already on our side.
[00:40:56.729 --> 00:40:58.710]  You're already slated for extermination.
[00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:02.773]  Slow, soft-kill extermination getting more and more intense.
[00:41:03.374 --> 00:41:05.735]  The system's already tested how to roll out a new plague.
[00:41:06.576 --> 00:41:14.143]  To have a celebrity lead the plague and to make sure they manage the plague so that real cures and the real cause is never found.
[00:41:15.084 --> 00:41:17.407]  They already know how to make money out of killing you.
[00:41:17.707 --> 00:41:19.208]  This isn't a joke.
[00:41:19.509 --> 00:41:21.310]  This isn't a conspiracy theory.
[00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:22.311]  It's a fact.
[00:41:22.832 --> 00:41:25.194]  You've got to join us, bureaucrats.
[00:41:25.755 --> 00:41:31.020]  All of you people that go to these Ivy League universities that are taught you're the elite and the public's a bunch of scum.
[00:41:32.247 --> 00:41:33.708]  You're seen as scum as well.
[00:41:34.128 --> 00:41:35.950]  You're creating a hell planet.
[00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:45.217]  All of you that work as bureaucrats or media people, all of you that hold this system up, the system is a meat grinder.
[00:41:45.257 --> 00:41:46.858]  The system is a wood chipper.
[00:41:47.498 --> 00:41:51.481]  And sure, they were putting the blacks in 50 years ago and you laughed at them, hearing them squeal.
[00:41:52.022 --> 00:41:54.284]  Now they've gotten up to you in the wood chipper.
[00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:56.921]  Are you going to continue to laugh about it?
[00:41:57.282 --> 00:41:58.963]  Are you going to continue to think you're a winner?
[00:41:59.283 --> 00:42:01.985]  Are you going to continue to think you're part of the winning team?
[00:42:02.225 --> 00:42:05.908]  You're not on the winning team in this predatory system.
[00:42:07.149 --> 00:42:09.571]  Killing millions of innocent Arabs isn't funny.
[00:42:11.673 --> 00:42:14.395]  The troops growing opium in Afghanistan isn't funny.
[00:42:15.834 --> 00:42:19.617]  All of this will come back on us, and is coming back on us.
[00:42:19.977 --> 00:42:23.940]  The globalists hate you, the American people, much more than they hate the Arabs.
[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:25.521]  Why are they killing the Arabs?
[00:42:25.961 --> 00:42:29.724]  Because they have courage, and they're independent, and they have big families.
[00:42:30.144 --> 00:42:33.546]  And they're certainly not perfect, and have a lot of cultural problems as well.
[00:42:33.686 --> 00:42:34.227]  Everybody does.
[00:42:35.216 --> 00:42:37.997]  But they are killing them because they're red-blooded, folks.
[00:42:38.618 --> 00:42:42.939]  They're taking them over so they can be exterminated through the soft kill weapons.
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.980]  They don't have fluoridated water, folks.
[00:42:45.821 --> 00:42:47.562]  Okay, they still are red-blooded.
[00:42:48.522 --> 00:42:51.443]  They are domesticating you to kill you.
[00:42:51.783 --> 00:42:55.485]  They are domesticating you ahead of your orderly extermination.
[00:42:55.865 --> 00:42:56.886]  This is not a drill.
[00:42:57.446 --> 00:43:00.107]  More calls in the whole last hour will be news.
[00:43:00.547 --> 00:43:01.908]  If you suffer from poor sleep,
[00:43:02.088 --> 00:43:03.429]  You've gotta try MyPillow.

[00:46:14.028 --> 00:46:15.149]  Gil in Texas.
[00:46:15.489 --> 00:46:16.710]  Thank you for holding her on the air.
[00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:17.450]  Good to talk to you.
[00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:20.092]  It's been a long time since I've spoken to you, Alex.
[00:46:21.093 --> 00:46:22.994]  My God, what can you say?
[00:46:23.054 --> 00:46:28.819]  I mean, I saw that segment where they actually have the troops protecting the poppy fields.
[00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:33.502]  Effectively, that's going to bring poison right here to this country.
[00:46:33.522 --> 00:46:36.364]  We have our troops protecting the poison that's going to poison our own people.
[00:46:37.506 --> 00:46:38.206]  Isn't that crazy?
[00:46:38.666 --> 00:46:40.447]  And they put it in our face.
[00:46:40.547 --> 00:46:41.647]  This is the PSYOP.
[00:46:41.707 --> 00:46:43.067]  They admit everything now.
[00:46:43.347 --> 00:46:44.968]  They're now all over the news today.
[00:46:45.028 --> 00:46:52.070]  I saw no fewer than five mainstream reports saying yes, microphones have been put up to listen to you.
[00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:56.311]  We call them gunshot detectors, but we're really recording you.
[00:46:56.331 --> 00:47:00.552]  And NSA software is tracking everything you do.
[00:47:01.012 --> 00:47:02.072]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:47:02.688 --> 00:47:09.449]  I had no security out here where I live, but now we have nighttime security in a vehicle with a pretty yellow flashing light.
[00:47:09.849 --> 00:47:14.190]  I imagine they have the ability to listen in on the conversations in and around our apartment.
[00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:18.931]  They found tar balls on Crystal Beach now, here in Texas.
[00:47:19.951 --> 00:47:25.952]  And they're not wanting to admit or confirm that it's possibly from the BP oil spill.
[00:47:26.472 --> 00:47:27.833]  There's just so much going on.
[00:47:28.613 --> 00:47:30.173]  I had a vision, I hope it's not true,
[00:47:30.902 --> 00:47:34.245]  Of blood in the skies here on the Gulf Coast.
[00:47:35.646 --> 00:47:39.709]  So you're down there by Galveston and you're saying you're seeing tarballs coming up?
[00:47:40.209 --> 00:47:40.990]  I'm near the boot.
[00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:44.733]  I'm actually in southeast Texas, Beaumont, Port Arthur, Orange area.
[00:47:46.314 --> 00:47:49.617]  Port Nature's where I picked Mars' hills from in that area.
[00:47:49.697 --> 00:47:53.040]  In fact, I can spit and hit Port Nature's from where I'm from.
[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:57.163]  Yeah, they're saying they're having tarballs wash up on
[00:47:57.919 --> 00:48:06.082]  On a Galveston Island in the beach and then, you know, of course the Coast Guard is in with the industrial complex.
[00:48:06.122 --> 00:48:09.703]  They're not going to admit that it's possibly from that spill.
[00:48:10.203 --> 00:48:15.065]  I'm hearing rumors also that this thing is far beyond what they're willing to admit.
[00:48:15.105 --> 00:48:16.646]  That it's probably a lot worse.
[00:48:20.174 --> 00:48:28.678]  Well, first they said it was 5,000 barrels a day, then it was 10, then 20, then 30, then 50,000 barrels a day.
[00:48:29.298 --> 00:48:37.383]  So they've lied so much, I don't think anyone even knows, but we do know from the satellite and aircraft photos that most of the oil
[00:48:38.473 --> 00:48:42.275]  It's coming up from 5,000 feet under the water is in underwater plumes.
[00:48:42.355 --> 00:48:45.778]  And so most of the oil hasn't even gotten to the surface.
[00:48:46.658 --> 00:49:00.987]  And as the Gulf heats up in late summer to the temperature of a bathtub, as it does every year, as it takes, again, all summer for it to get hot, such a large body, but once it gets hot, it gets really hot, that all that oil is then going to come up.
[00:49:01.367 --> 00:49:04.649]  Because when it's cold, for some reason, it causes it to stay lower in the water.
[00:49:05.130 --> 00:49:06.991]  And it's going to off-gas all those gases.
[00:49:07.631 --> 00:49:09.533]  And so this is just horrible.
[00:49:10.293 --> 00:49:19.301]  And yeah, the reports I've seen are that Hurricane Alex did blow in a lot of that oil and that some of it had drifted over towards Texas.
[00:49:19.921 --> 00:49:25.386]  And it's unconfirmed whether or not that's from that oil spill or some other spill.
[00:49:25.426 --> 00:49:29.890]  Because when everybody's busy watching this spill, other oil companies don't have to be as careful.
[00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:30.710]  Anything else?
[00:49:31.491 --> 00:49:32.632]  Oh, Project Wolfbox.
[00:49:33.905 --> 00:49:34.786]  What's the latest?
[00:49:34.826 --> 00:49:35.586]  You're hearing anything?
[00:49:35.786 --> 00:49:46.413]  There's some people on the internet saying that maybe at 48 hours after the 4th, they might slowly start implementing this mass evacuation of the Gulf Coast, probably including my area as well.
[00:49:46.953 --> 00:49:47.273]  I don't know.
[00:49:47.293 --> 00:49:50.655]  There's a lot of speculation and unfortunately no facts.
[00:49:50.855 --> 00:49:56.439]  I tried to open the phones up for whistleblowers and we got some interesting info but nothing specific.
[00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:08.286]  I would imagine they're going to start trying to evacuate people, if they do, when that main oil comes ashore, being pushed by hurricanes coming into the Gulf.
[00:50:08.386 --> 00:50:10.147]  We'll continue to track it, Gil.
[00:50:10.167 --> 00:50:12.849]  All right, here's... Gil, thank you.
[00:50:13.129 --> 00:50:13.949]  We've got to go to break here.
[00:50:13.969 --> 00:50:14.570]  Good to hear from you.
[00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:14.990]  God bless.
[00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:21.654]  And we'll pray for you down there on the Texas coast, but especially those in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida, being the heaviest hit.
[00:50:22.314 --> 00:50:26.257]  And of course, the Florida Keys, the main body of oil in those...
[00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:31.864]  Currents is being directed out towards the keys.
[00:50:32.204 --> 00:50:33.846]  We're going to come back with the fourth and final hour.
[00:50:34.006 --> 00:50:37.731]  I will cover news and then back to your calls.
[00:50:37.751 --> 00:50:38.391]  Stay with us.

[00:52:08.032 --> 00:52:10.673]  It is the fourth and final hour.
[00:52:10.773 --> 00:52:14.295]  I am going to cover news intensely for the next half hour.
[00:52:15.215 --> 00:52:19.537]  Then we will go to your phone calls, Tim, Ron, Michael, and others that are patiently holding.
[00:52:19.917 --> 00:52:22.399]  You'll want to get queued up for calls in 30 minutes.
[00:52:22.419 --> 00:52:23.259]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:52:23.279 --> 00:52:23.899]  It is July 5th, 2010.
[00:52:24.019 --> 00:52:25.200]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:27.361]  Okay, let me go ahead and launch into this today.
[00:52:37.194 --> 00:52:50.350]  This is really our top story and the issue here is not that the media is starting to admit that we're in a depression, but that why did they cover it up this long and why are they now admitting it?
[00:52:50.871 --> 00:52:55.877]  That means the establishment has made the decision to start
[00:52:57.185 --> 00:53:00.649]  Coming out with this in the open, and that's a question I would field to the listeners.
[00:53:00.709 --> 00:53:01.830]  Why do you think that's the case?
[00:53:02.271 --> 00:53:03.972]  I have my take on it, and I'll be going over that.
[00:53:04.553 --> 00:53:06.555]  Here is CNBC.
[00:53:07.196 --> 00:53:10.039]  Dow repeats Great Depression pattern.
[00:53:13.303 --> 00:53:17.627]  And this is what our guest, the economist we've had on, had been saying for two years.
[00:53:18.821 --> 00:53:27.366]  That we've really been in a recession for four, a depression for two, and that the charts mirror what happened in 29 through 33.
[00:53:27.806 --> 00:53:30.888]  They didn't announce that we were in a depression until the middle of 1933.
[00:53:31.048 --> 00:53:38.392]  And then, of course, the War Powers Act was declared, and the United States was put under a form of economic martial law.
[00:53:40.864 --> 00:53:48.975]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average is repeating a pattern that appeared just before markets fell during the Great Depression.
[00:53:50.476 --> 00:53:56.424]  Darrell Guppy, CEO at Guppy Traders, told CNBC today.
[00:53:57.489 --> 00:53:59.929]  Those who don't remember history are doomed to repeat it.
[00:54:00.490 --> 00:54:05.991]  There was a head-and-shoulders pattern that developed before the Great Depression in 1929.
[00:54:06.671 --> 00:54:12.872]  Then, with the recovery of 1930, we had another head-and-shoulders pattern that preceded a fall in the market.
[00:54:13.272 --> 00:54:18.153]  And in the current Dow situation, we see an exact repeat of that environment, Guppy said.
[00:54:18.173 --> 00:54:21.653]  The Dow retreated 457 points, or 4.5 percent, last week to close.
[00:54:25.794 --> 00:54:26.614]  At 9,686.
[00:54:26.954 --> 00:54:29.595]  Now the Globalist may go prop that up.
[00:54:29.635 --> 00:54:30.275]  I haven't looked at that.
[00:54:30.295 --> 00:54:31.296]  Will you guys pull up the Dow?
[00:54:31.636 --> 00:54:33.836]  It was at 9,686 Friday.
[00:54:33.877 --> 00:54:35.057]  Let's see what it is today.
[00:54:36.177 --> 00:54:41.179]  Guppy said a Dow fall below 9,800 confirmed the head and shoulders pattern.
[00:54:42.179 --> 00:54:45.041]  The Shanghai Composite is seeing a very rapid collapse.
[00:54:45.501 --> 00:54:48.703]  Falling below 2,500 would suggest a major fall in the Dow.
[00:54:49.063 --> 00:54:56.647]  He added, in the European markets, Guppy says Frankfurt DAX is witnessing a different pattern to London's FTSE.
[00:54:56.667 --> 00:54:59.868]  And again, I put out an emergency alert Friday.
[00:55:01.229 --> 00:55:02.550]  SOS emergency alert.
[00:55:04.249 --> 00:55:06.250]  Emergency SOS is the name of the video.
[00:55:06.991 --> 00:55:08.112]  You can search that term.
[00:55:08.152 --> 00:55:12.535]  It's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and it states the facts.
[00:55:13.055 --> 00:55:19.059]  The private central banks, they're not even banks, they're just fraudsters, have set this up in the last 15 years.
[00:55:19.099 --> 00:55:20.320]  They've admitted they've set it up.
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:29.086]  It's all pre-planned and we've got to stop them.
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:37.361]  I guess the Dow's down again today, another 46 plus points, 46.05.
[00:55:37.861 --> 00:55:39.902]  It's closed today.
[00:55:40.242 --> 00:55:41.942]  Okay, I guess it's a holiday, so that's Friday.
[00:55:43.183 --> 00:55:47.543]  It goes on to say, Dow repeats Great Depression pattern.
[00:55:48.744 --> 00:55:49.484]  Here's another one.
[00:55:49.944 --> 00:55:50.864]  With the U.S.
[00:55:50.924 --> 00:55:54.385]  trapped in depression, this really is starting to feel like 1932.
[00:55:54.565 --> 00:55:59.286]  And that's Ambrose Evans Pritchard, a very prestigious writer.
[00:56:01.089 --> 00:56:03.791]  With London Telegraph, the U.S.
[00:56:03.831 --> 00:56:09.956]  workforce shrank 652,000 jobs in June, one of the sharpest contractions ever.
[00:56:10.597 --> 00:56:13.019]  That rate of hourly earnings fell 0.1%.
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:16.442]  Wages are flirting with deflation.
[00:56:17.223 --> 00:56:23.348]  So they're devaluing the currency while you have depression in the real economy.
[00:56:24.569 --> 00:56:26.310]  Wall Street's making record profits.
[00:56:27.611 --> 00:56:29.353]  You've got deflation in wages.
[00:56:30.967 --> 00:56:33.268]  But inflation in currency value.
[00:56:35.629 --> 00:56:38.530]  Now, they didn't believe that could even exist until the late 70s.
[00:56:39.170 --> 00:56:40.131]  It's stag inflation.
[00:56:40.431 --> 00:56:42.772]  This is leaning towards hyper stag inflation.
[00:56:45.629 --> 00:56:47.411]  I mean, we live in a completely rigged economy.
[00:56:47.951 --> 00:56:51.774]  And even MSNBC had a headline, or CNBC admitting that last week.
[00:56:52.415 --> 00:56:54.917]  Dylan Radigan came out and said the entire stock market's rigged.
[00:56:55.317 --> 00:56:55.758]  It is!
[00:56:56.238 --> 00:56:58.440]  It's a casino meant to rip you off.
[00:56:58.500 --> 00:56:59.421]  Don't be a sucker!

[01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:26.182]  We're back live, eight minutes into the fourth and final hour here today.
[01:00:26.202 --> 01:00:28.383]  Your call's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:00:29.023 --> 01:00:31.544]  So, Dow repeats Great Depression pattern.
[01:00:32.405 --> 01:00:34.566]  Stock markets worldwide in massive retreat.
[01:00:35.046 --> 01:00:37.167]  There is no way to pay back
[01:00:37.967 --> 01:00:44.393]  The 1.5 quadrillion, 1,500 trillion, that these banks have created.
[01:00:44.533 --> 01:00:47.676]  It is designed to destroy us.
[01:00:47.916 --> 01:00:53.261]  It is a giant lead weight they trick us into connecting ourselves to.
[01:00:53.962 --> 01:00:55.123]  And then they hold us hostage.
[01:00:55.163 --> 01:01:03.306]  If you want the economy to come back, if you want your pension fund, if you want your retirement, you've got to give us, the bankers, even more power over your economy.
[01:01:03.666 --> 01:01:05.467]  You've got to give us trillions more.
[01:01:05.887 --> 01:01:13.791]  And you give them the trillions, and Congress says, and the Parliament of England says, and the EU says to the central banks, where'd the money go?
[01:01:14.111 --> 01:01:15.912]  And they say, we're not going to tell you.
[01:01:16.792 --> 01:01:18.253]  This is a swindle.
[01:01:18.813 --> 01:01:20.534]  But because they're wearing $5,000 designer suits,
[01:01:23.635 --> 01:01:29.238]  And because they control your pension funds, no one goes to jail because they're holding us hostage.
[01:01:29.699 --> 01:01:32.640]  Dow repeats Great Depression pattern.
[01:01:34.481 --> 01:01:35.782]  That's CNBC.
[01:01:35.922 --> 01:01:36.983]  Here's London Telegraph.
[01:01:37.643 --> 01:01:38.464]  With the U.S.
[01:01:38.964 --> 01:01:42.226]  trapped in depression, this really is starting to feel like 1932.
[01:01:42.266 --> 01:01:45.728]  652,000 people lost their jobs in the month of June alone.
[01:01:52.318 --> 01:01:55.802]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've known for four years we've been in a recession.
[01:01:56.422 --> 01:01:57.723]  All the economists we've had on.
[01:01:58.384 --> 01:02:00.126]  You can see it around you in business.
[01:02:00.826 --> 01:02:03.009]  They were telling you the economy was great four years ago.
[01:02:03.509 --> 01:02:06.252]  They've been telling you it's been getting better the last year and a half.
[01:02:06.392 --> 01:02:07.113]  Baloney!
[01:02:08.494 --> 01:02:11.477]  Anyone in business, anyone in the real world, I mean...
[01:02:12.917 --> 01:02:19.263]  46 states on the verge of collapsing, according to Bloomberg, and the federal government's own admissions.
[01:02:19.723 --> 01:02:21.144]  Is that a recovering country?
[01:02:21.164 --> 01:02:23.967]  46 states on the verge of collapsing.
[01:02:24.627 --> 01:02:39.160]  But the big private mega-banks, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, they're all doing good with record profits and taking over everything, so they tell you the economy's great.
[01:02:42.549 --> 01:02:48.951]  And without even looking today, I've got a stack of mainstream news articles about how we're in a depression.
[01:02:49.371 --> 01:02:51.171]  Suddenly they're admitting we're in a depression.
[01:02:51.431 --> 01:02:51.691]  Why?
[01:02:52.331 --> 01:03:07.115]  Because they're going to scare us again and say, well, you better give the Federal Reserve unlimited power over the entire economy, over every facet of the economy, or they won't be able to fix it.
[01:03:08.855 --> 01:03:10.076]  They told you that a year and a half ago.
[01:03:12.406 --> 01:03:18.052]  Now they can offer their new global currency and their SDR as the solution to the crisis they've created.
[01:03:18.392 --> 01:03:18.833]  That's why.
[01:03:18.853 --> 01:03:19.794]  They've already milked us.
[01:03:19.814 --> 01:03:21.195]  They've already gotten us positioned.
[01:03:21.515 --> 01:03:22.777]  They've got us where they want us.
[01:03:23.017 --> 01:03:25.940]  They wanted to get us deeper into a depression and more in debt to them.
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:27.502]  And they've done that now.
[01:03:28.763 --> 01:03:32.527]  And they're coming back saying, gee, we just want to save the economy.
[01:03:35.239 --> 01:03:38.760]  And it is like having a 10-pound tumor growing on the side of your heart.
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:41.940]  If we do remove the tumor, it may kill us.
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:44.181]  But if we don't remove the tumor, we're dead.
[01:03:46.861 --> 01:03:51.122]  I mean, we're that ingratiated and that integrated in with these crooks.
[01:03:51.422 --> 01:03:53.442]  They've made it where we're dependent on them.
[01:03:54.782 --> 01:03:56.123]  That's the whole ballgame.
[01:03:56.423 --> 01:03:59.703]  A Ponzi scheme that's too big to fail.
[01:04:00.003 --> 01:04:01.103]  That's the name of their game.
[01:04:01.123 --> 01:04:04.464]  A Ponzi scheme too big to fail that's designed to fail.
[01:04:06.124 --> 01:04:08.606]  And when it fails, it conquers you economically.
[01:04:08.626 --> 01:04:13.489]  You remember this headline last week?
[01:04:13.649 --> 01:04:14.749]  The Third Depression.
[01:04:14.789 --> 01:04:16.130]  Paul Krugman, New York Times.
[01:04:16.330 --> 01:04:20.033]  Why are... but of course his answer is giving the government and the Federal Reserve more power and more money.
[01:04:21.294 --> 01:04:21.914]  More spending.
[01:04:22.215 --> 01:04:22.735]  Your money.
[01:04:23.335 --> 01:04:24.176]  And they've already decided.
[01:04:24.196 --> 01:04:30.020]  They're going to devalue the dollar and on its ashes build the new SDR that you pay carbon taxes to.
[01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:34.103]  Think of the magnitude of what's happening right now.
[01:04:34.563 --> 01:04:38.446]  And then I saw stacks of these articles without even looking.
[01:04:42.689 --> 01:04:44.190]  Happy 4th of July.
[01:04:44.370 --> 01:04:45.571]  America needs it.
[01:04:46.112 --> 01:04:50.655]  The great republic is in a perilous state politically and economically.
[01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:56.704]  This is by Jeffrey Simpson from the Saturday Globe and Mail.
[01:04:57.524 --> 01:05:00.947]  We can only hope our American friends enjoy their national holiday weekend.
[01:05:01.287 --> 01:05:05.751]  Let them wave their flags, enjoy their picnics, and show their love of country, because they need a holiday.
[01:05:07.052 --> 01:05:10.815]  And my sister is in England.
[01:05:12.496 --> 01:05:15.138]  She just got out of college, so she's taking the European trip.
[01:05:16.299 --> 01:05:18.701]  And my parents were over 4th of July,
[01:05:20.669 --> 01:05:30.954]  She called to say hi from England and she said, oh it's so nice the Brits are all dressed up like Americans and they're making fun of us and it's fun and...
[01:05:32.170 --> 01:05:33.671]  And it's like a cute thing.
[01:05:33.811 --> 01:05:39.173]  And of course, I separately knew the culture and knew that she said it's like they think we're silly.
[01:05:39.213 --> 01:05:40.894]  They like us, but it's like we're dumb.
[01:05:40.914 --> 01:05:41.795]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:05:41.835 --> 01:05:43.155]  We're a big joke.
[01:05:43.696 --> 01:05:50.039]  You see, first, we're blamed for everything in the world, all the wars, all the evil, when we've just been the blood supply for the cancer.
[01:05:51.039 --> 01:05:54.461]  And now, Obama wasn't the messianic leader.
[01:05:56.081 --> 01:05:57.362]  Americans are just a joke.
[01:05:57.382 --> 01:05:59.844]  She said, yes, we're just a sad joke now.
[01:05:59.884 --> 01:06:02.666]  And they come over and say, oh, you're a pathetic joke.
[01:06:05.708 --> 01:06:08.990]  See, it's something fun.
[01:06:09.010 --> 01:06:10.691]  I mean, they're slaves over there as well.
[01:06:10.851 --> 01:06:14.474]  And the media makes it into a fun joke to make fun of Americans.
[01:06:14.934 --> 01:06:19.017]  The same corporate media that owns the media over there owns our media.
[01:06:19.257 --> 01:06:20.618]  And they'll put out different flavors.
[01:06:20.878 --> 01:06:23.120]  You know, here, people make fun of the French.
[01:06:24.298 --> 01:06:29.300]  How they're pathetic and how they're cowards and all of this baloney.
[01:06:32.161 --> 01:06:33.181]  I need a water, boys.
[01:06:33.261 --> 01:06:35.722]  I'm coughing here.
[01:06:38.623 --> 01:06:39.324]  I found one.
[01:06:39.344 --> 01:06:44.626]  A delicious plastic glass with estrogen mimicking hormones.
[01:06:44.666 --> 01:06:45.246]  Just what I need.
[01:06:51.175 --> 01:06:52.536]  Okay, let me continue to the news here.
[01:06:52.556 --> 01:07:03.099]  I had another little stack of depression news that I'm looking for here.
[01:07:03.119 --> 01:07:06.741]  I'll have to find that during the break.
[01:07:07.421 --> 01:07:18.545]  Let me shift gears here before I get into that list of other news media.
[01:07:20.509 --> 01:07:31.478]  Talking about how America's basically done for, and that's now a popular, popular little sport.
[01:07:32.559 --> 01:07:33.620]  Well here, I found one of them.
[01:07:34.101 --> 01:07:38.725]  Let me go over this report for you.
[01:07:38.745 --> 01:07:43.389]  50 Random Facts That Make You Wonder What In The World Has Happened To America.
[01:07:44.169 --> 01:07:46.011]  This is from the Economic Collapse blog.
[01:07:48.547 --> 01:07:49.751]  So let's go through the 50.
[01:07:50.713 --> 01:07:51.957]  Let's see if we have time.
[01:07:52.779 --> 01:07:54.845]  Number 50, counting down to number 1.
[01:07:57.785 --> 01:08:02.768]  A new report released by the United Nations is publicly calling for the establishment of a world currency.
[01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:07.691]  And none of the major news networks are even covering it.
[01:08:07.711 --> 01:08:07.691]  49.
[01:08:08.091 --> 01:08:21.259]  The state of California is so broke that Arnold Schwarzenegger has ordered California's state controller to reduce state workers' pay for July to the federal minimum allowed by law. $7.25.
[01:08:26.559 --> 01:08:38.292]  A police officer in Oklahoma recently tasered an 86-year-old disabled grandma in her bed and stepped on her oxygen hose until she couldn't breathe because they considered her to be a threat.
[01:08:39.079 --> 01:08:41.000]  Because she argued with him, didn't touch him.
[01:08:41.881 --> 01:08:44.702]  That tortures what heroes do.
[01:08:45.083 --> 01:08:44.702]  47.
[01:08:45.503 --> 01:08:46.363]  In early 2009, U.S.
[01:08:46.643 --> 01:08:57.029]  net national savings as a percentage of GDP went negative for the first time since 1952, and it was continued in its downward trend since then.
[01:08:57.049 --> 01:08:57.029]  46.
[01:08:57.630 --> 01:09:05.194]  Corexit 9500 is so incredibly toxic that the U.K.'
[01:09:05.174 --> 01:09:07.736]  's Marine Management Organization has completely banned it.
[01:09:08.658 --> 01:09:13.481]  So if there was a major oil spill in the North Sea, BP would not be able to use it.
[01:09:13.941 --> 01:09:23.386]  And yet BP has dumped over a million gallons of dispersants such as this toxic chemical, Corexit, 9,500 in the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:09:23.867 --> 01:09:24.507]  Forty-five.
[01:09:24.867 --> 01:09:25.928]  For the first time in U.S.
[01:09:25.948 --> 01:09:29.330]  history, more than 40 million Americans are on food stamps, and the U.S.
[01:09:29.350 --> 01:09:33.912]  Department of Agriculture projects the number will go to 43 million Americans by 2011.
[01:09:35.433 --> 01:09:37.596]  That's the equivalent of 21st century soup lines.
[01:09:37.616 --> 01:09:37.596]  44.
[01:09:38.117 --> 01:09:50.274]  It has come out that one employee used a Federal Emergency Management Agency credit card to buy $4,318 in happy birthday gift cards.
[01:09:50.694 --> 01:09:51.936]  Two other FEMA officials
[01:09:52.757 --> 01:09:59.841]  Charged the cost of 360 golf umbrellas, $9,000 to taxpayers.
[01:09:59.861 --> 01:10:06.185]  43 researchers at the State University of New York in Buffalo received $389,000 from the U.S.
[01:10:06.245 --> 01:10:16.512]  government to pay 100 residents of Buffalo $45 each to record how much malt liquor they drink and how much pot they smoke each day.
[01:10:17.992 --> 01:10:24.434]  42.
[01:10:18.072 --> 01:10:24.434]  The average duration of unemployment in the United States has risen to an all-time high.
[01:10:24.454 --> 01:10:24.434]  41.
[01:10:24.955 --> 01:10:27.596]  But Obama says the economy's doing great, though.
[01:10:27.916 --> 01:10:28.756]  Record unemployment.
[01:10:29.436 --> 01:10:32.637]  Record people on food stamps, but everything's fine.
[01:10:32.657 --> 01:10:32.637]  41.
[01:10:33.217 --> 01:10:40.260]  The bottom 40% of all income earners in the United States now collectively own less than 1% of the nation's wealth.
[01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:41.280]  Number 40.
[01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:48.123]  In the U.S., the average federal worker now earns about twice as much as the average worker in the private sector.
[01:10:48.463 --> 01:10:48.123]  39.
[01:10:48.804 --> 01:10:54.206]  Back in 1950, each retiree's Social Security benefit was paid for by 16 workers.
[01:10:54.486 --> 01:10:59.328]  Today, each retiree's Social Security benefit is paid for by approximately 3.3 workers.
[01:11:00.329 --> 01:11:05.471]  By 2025, it is projected that there will be approximately two workers for each retiree.
[01:11:06.704 --> 01:11:07.225]  Number 38.
[01:11:07.545 --> 01:11:08.627]  According to the U.S.
[01:11:08.647 --> 01:11:11.953]  Treasury Department report to Congress, the U.S.
[01:11:11.993 --> 01:11:17.442]  national debt will top $13.6 trillion this year and climb to an estimated $19.6 trillion by 2015.
[01:11:21.581 --> 01:11:23.382]  That's just what the media reports on, folks.
[01:11:23.422 --> 01:11:26.223]  The Washington Post admits $600 trillion in derivatives.
[01:11:26.504 --> 01:11:31.446]  And those bankers claim, we will pay for all of that, even though it's not ours.
[01:11:31.466 --> 01:11:31.446]  37.
[01:11:31.506 --> 01:11:38.630]  The federal government actually had the goal to ask for online donations that will supposedly go towards paying off national debt.
[01:11:40.467 --> 01:11:52.654]  36.
[01:11:41.068 --> 01:11:52.654]  The Cactus Bug Project at the University of Florida has allocated $325,000 in economic stimulus funds to study the mating decisions of cactus bugs.
[01:11:52.674 --> 01:11:52.654]  35.
[01:11:52.714 --> 01:11:56.916]  A dinner... We're gonna come back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:57.376 --> 01:11:58.077]  We'll continue.
[01:12:01.078 --> 01:12:02.379]  Don't answer it!

[01:12:18.857 --> 01:12:22.940]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?

[01:12:53.601 --> 01:12:53.781]  That's 800-477-9256.
[01:12:59.850 --> 01:13:09.593]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[01:13:09.893 --> 01:13:15.935]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[01:13:16.315 --> 01:13:25.158]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[01:13:25.538 --> 01:13:34.441]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[01:13:34.722 --> 01:13:39.303]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world-reserved currency.
[01:13:39.323 --> 01:13:40.884]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:13:41.124 --> 01:13:43.625]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[01:13:43.925 --> 01:13:45.407]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[01:13:47.230 --> 01:13:51.075]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[01:13:51.415 --> 01:13:52.277]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[01:13:52.297 --> 01:13:52.677]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[01:14:02.592 --> 01:14:04.754]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:14:24.074 --> 01:14:29.616]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:14:30.017 --> 01:14:33.738]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:14:34.218 --> 01:14:38.200]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:44.062]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:14:44.442 --> 01:14:47.424]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:14:48.004 --> 01:14:49.424]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:14:49.985 --> 01:14:50.425]  It's here.

[01:14:59.773 --> 01:15:02.375]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:15:02.795 --> 01:15:07.758]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:15:08.118 --> 01:15:09.839]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:15:10.159 --> 01:15:14.982]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:15:15.163 --> 01:15:16.123]  How much do you want?
[01:15:16.343 --> 01:15:17.104]  When do you want it?
[01:15:17.464 --> 01:15:19.065]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:15:19.365 --> 01:15:20.186]  When will you need it?
[01:15:20.426 --> 01:15:22.487]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:15:22.627 --> 01:15:23.748]  Will there be any food?
[01:15:23.968 --> 01:15:25.289]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:15:25.489 --> 01:15:30.551]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:15:30.751 --> 01:15:33.932]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:15:34.332 --> 01:15:37.833]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:15:38.153 --> 01:15:39.134]  How much will you need?
[01:15:39.394 --> 01:15:39.994]  We don't know.
[01:15:40.294 --> 01:15:41.195]  How much do you want?
[01:15:41.395 --> 01:15:42.135]  All you can get.
[01:15:42.315 --> 01:15:43.155]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:15:43.415 --> 01:15:46.176]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:15:46.476 --> 01:15:49.517]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com
[01:15:53.999 --> 01:15:54.820]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:15:54.900 --> 01:16:10.392]  Alright, I'm going to try to race through more of these 50 random facts that make you wonder what in the world has happened to America.
[01:16:10.412 --> 01:16:13.475]  Of course, I would add a few of my own.
[01:16:14.415 --> 01:16:20.780]  Why is the government now openly admitting they've put microphones up everywhere, putting our public comments
[01:16:21.818 --> 01:16:25.160]  In parks, in malls, through NSA databases.
[01:16:27.121 --> 01:16:29.422]  That's coming up after I take calls in the next segment.
[01:16:29.903 --> 01:16:33.185]  I'm going to get into the police state stack of news from today.
[01:16:33.205 --> 01:16:44.191]  A dinner cruise company in Chicago got nearly one million in economic stimulus funds to combat terrorism.
[01:16:49.352 --> 01:16:56.937]  Number 34, it is being reported that a six-year-old girl from Ohio is on the no-fly list maintained by U.S.
[01:16:57.318 --> 01:17:00.019]  Homeland Security, and they refuse to take her off.
[01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:04.783]  It's about it being absurd, where you just accept that they do whatever they want.
[01:17:07.605 --> 01:17:08.085]  Number 33.
[01:17:08.406 --> 01:17:21.939]  During the first quarter of 2010, the total number of loans that are at least three months past due in the United States increased for the 16th consecutive quarter to an all-time record, I would add.
[01:17:21.959 --> 01:17:21.939]  32.
[01:17:22.299 --> 01:17:30.928]  According to a new report, Americans spend twice as much as residents of other developed countries on health care, but get lower quality and far less efficiency.
[01:17:32.145 --> 01:17:34.629]  Well, government just took it over, so it's going to get a lot worse.
[01:17:34.970 --> 01:17:41.200]  And they've now admitted, in the AP, the Hill, Obama has admitted, oh, I'm sorry, you don't get free health care.
[01:17:41.981 --> 01:17:43.704]  We make you buy health care of your poor.
[01:17:46.148 --> 01:17:46.528]  I'm sorry.
[01:17:49.312 --> 01:17:49.893]  Here's another one.
[01:17:49.913 --> 01:17:50.733]  Well, yeah.
[01:17:50.754 --> 01:17:53.276]  For at least six, seven years they've had cloned chickens.
[01:18:09.884 --> 01:18:11.605]  And cloned cow meat.
[01:18:12.145 --> 01:18:13.786]  I mean, you've been eating it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:14.306 --> 01:18:20.069]  The FDA has announced that offspring of cloned animals could be in our food supply right now, and that there's nothing that they can do about it.
[01:18:23.231 --> 01:18:25.992]  Yeah, but if you don't pay one nickel of taxes, they're gonna come.
[01:18:26.033 --> 01:18:28.014]  But, oh, we can't do anything about the cloned animals.
[01:18:28.254 --> 01:18:37.559]  We can harass Amish people and arrest people that get caught all over the country selling eggs on the street corner that they got from their own chickens.
[01:18:38.669 --> 01:18:41.551]  But we can't stop big agribusiness from giving you clone food.
[01:18:43.833 --> 01:18:44.433]  Continuing.
[01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:49.878]  In May, sales of new homes in the United States dropped the lowest level ever recorded.
[01:18:49.898 --> 01:18:52.359]  And that's even with cooked federal numbers.
[01:18:54.001 --> 01:18:55.822]  Continuing.
[01:18:56.102 --> 01:19:01.807]  In 1958, the ratio of the average executive paycheck to the average worker's paycheck was about 30 to 1.
[01:19:02.407 --> 01:19:05.269]  Since the year 2000, the ratio has been arranged between 300 to 500 to 1.
[01:19:08.456 --> 01:19:22.900]  Number 27, federal border officials recently said that Mexican drug cartels have not only set up shop on Arizona soil, they're actually maintaining lookout bases in strategic locations in the hills of southern Arizona as much as 80 miles into the United States.
[01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:24.820]  And that's back in the news today.
[01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:28.041]  Huge border wars in Texas and Arizona over the weekend.
[01:19:28.741 --> 01:19:35.743]  And if Americans now go down major highways, Mexican troops and cartels actually stop them and steal everything they've got.
[01:19:36.323 --> 01:19:37.684]  And the police refuse to even help.
[01:19:37.744 --> 01:19:39.746]  I mean, it's just total collapse of society.
[01:19:41.528 --> 01:19:42.288]  The globalists love it.
[01:19:43.089 --> 01:19:43.629]  The U.S.
[01:19:43.669 --> 01:19:46.612]  government has declared some parts of Arizona off-limits to U.S.
[01:19:46.632 --> 01:19:47.032]  citizens.
[01:19:47.072 --> 01:19:50.896]  That's number 26, because of the threat of violence from Mexican drug smugglers.
[01:19:51.416 --> 01:19:53.017]  Number 25, we're halfway through.
[01:19:53.037 --> 01:19:57.862]  And every one of these I read, I can think of 10 or 15 things even worse that are going on.
[01:19:59.029 --> 01:19:59.530]  Twenty-five.
[01:19:59.570 --> 01:20:10.278]  According to the credit card repayment calculator, if you owe $6,000 on a credit card with a 20% interest rate and only pay a minimum payment each time, it will take you 54 years to pay off the credit card.
[01:20:11.479 --> 01:20:16.543]  During those 54 years, you will pay $26,168 in interest rate changes in addition to the $6,000 in principal that you are required to pay back.
[01:20:16.583 --> 01:20:17.164]  So you'll pay $22,000 plus.
[01:20:26.383 --> 01:20:30.364]  Yeah, $23,000 plus... No, no, $33,000.
[01:20:30.585 --> 01:20:31.085]  $26,000 and $6,000.
[01:20:31.165 --> 01:20:35.006]  So you'll be paying over $30,000.
[01:20:35.146 --> 01:20:38.907]  That's kind of like, you know, the central banks.
[01:20:38.947 --> 01:20:41.308]  They owe a billion dollars to somebody they made up.
[01:20:41.828 --> 01:20:43.269]  They end up paying back $50 billion.
[01:20:43.289 --> 01:20:44.229]  They still owe $50 billion.
[01:20:44.269 --> 01:20:45.029]  That's like Nigeria.
[01:20:45.070 --> 01:20:45.930]  I love to use that example.
[01:20:47.170 --> 01:21:04.114]  24.
[01:20:47.230 --> 01:21:04.114]  According to prepared testimony by Goldman Sachs Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn, Goldman Sachs shorted roughly $615 million of the collateralized debt obligations and residual mortgage-backed securities the firm underwrote since late 2006.
[01:21:04.574 --> 01:21:08.334]  And that's just one report on one Timberwolf transaction.
[01:21:08.555 --> 01:21:11.975]  Yeah, they were betting against what they were selling their clients.
[01:21:14.396 --> 01:21:15.616]  That's their whole business model.
[01:21:16.974 --> 01:21:24.563]  Number 23, the six biggest banks in the United States now possess assets equivalent to 60% of America's gross national product.
[01:21:25.184 --> 01:21:26.906]  And when they're done, they'll have over 100%.
[01:21:27.026 --> 01:21:29.108]  How is that possible?
[01:21:29.308 --> 01:21:35.396]  They'll own everything, and you'll owe them a bunch of interest on it so it'll be more.
[01:21:36.963 --> 01:21:39.784]  I mean, it's like they've made 600 trillion dollars in made-up derivatives.
[01:21:40.445 --> 01:21:44.046]  I'm gonna run through the rest of these, go to your calls, and hit some police state news.
[01:21:44.066 --> 01:21:45.167]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:21:45.227 --> 01:21:46.167]  Long segment coming up.
[01:21:46.227 --> 01:21:47.047]  Ton of key info.
[01:21:50.469 --> 01:21:51.369]  We're on the march.
[01:21:51.870 --> 01:21:53.470]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:54.391 --> 01:21:57.072]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:59.807 --> 01:22:04.050]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:22:04.370 --> 01:22:04.970]  Number one.
[01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:08.432]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:22:08.693 --> 01:22:09.273]  Number two.
[01:22:09.553 --> 01:22:14.116]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:22:14.456 --> 01:22:14.897]  It's true.
[01:22:15.197 --> 01:22:19.760]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:20.620]  Number three.
[01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:24.182]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:22:24.483 --> 01:22:28.185]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:22:28.385 --> 01:22:28.926]  Number 4.
[01:22:29.186 --> 01:22:31.548]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:22:31.929 --> 01:22:35.332]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:22:35.613 --> 01:22:35.833]  Number 5.
[01:22:36.413 --> 01:22:40.338]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:22:40.558 --> 01:22:45.323]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:23:52.117 --> 01:23:52.937]  Thank you!
[01:23:59.383 --> 01:24:01.706]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:24:01.766 --> 01:24:03.968]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:24:03.988 --> 01:24:06.872]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:24:07.312 --> 01:24:12.058]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:24:12.418 --> 01:24:16.603]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:24:16.903 --> 01:24:19.244]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:24:19.364 --> 01:24:21.785]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:24:22.145 --> 01:24:24.706]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:24:25.047 --> 01:24:32.650]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:24:32.987 --> 01:24:38.290]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:41.171]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:24:41.231 --> 01:24:44.673]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:45.833]  And I got news for you.
[01:24:45.993 --> 01:24:47.314]  You're everyone else.
[01:24:47.334 --> 01:24:48.375]  Invisible Empire.

[01:25:08.324 --> 01:25:15.087]  I don't know if we'll have time to play this, but it's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPanda.com.
[01:25:15.647 --> 01:25:18.349]  Anderson Cooper saying the First Amendment is dead.
[01:25:20.269 --> 01:25:28.113]  And then going over, Helm, even, I've got a frontline story here of a photographer they'd hired.
[01:25:30.049 --> 01:25:33.950]  To go down to Texas City and take photos of the BP refinery.
[01:25:34.690 --> 01:25:38.571]  This is the same one that had a big leak a few years ago and they got a big fine over it.
[01:25:39.271 --> 01:25:42.912]  And the cops showed up and they said, we don't care, you don't take photos in America.
[01:25:46.733 --> 01:25:50.194]  I was coming back from the beach about a year ago.
[01:25:50.214 --> 01:25:52.674]  And this was down in Corpus Christi.
[01:25:54.055 --> 01:25:55.355]  I was coming back from Port Aransas.
[01:25:56.619 --> 01:26:18.589]  And I was getting on an access road and saw this big refinery and I said you know I always need b-roll for my films and I want to expose how the carbon tax is meant to shut down our society and I might mention that the big oil companies are actually financing it and that they got together in 96 this has been declassified well not declassified the AP
[01:26:20.145 --> 01:26:24.596]  Associated Press sued and got those minutes in 2000.
[01:26:25.077 --> 01:26:29.408]  We've written articles about it and covered it if you want to go pull the stories up.
[01:26:30.273 --> 01:26:40.081]  Where they shut down all of the refineries that they didn't own or bought them up and closed them to create an artificial bottleneck because there's too much oil.
[01:26:40.482 --> 01:26:41.723]  And so they want to keep prices up.
[01:26:41.763 --> 01:26:42.463]  How do they do that?
[01:26:42.804 --> 01:26:44.545]  They shut down refining capacity.
[01:26:44.885 --> 01:26:48.529]  They fund environmental groups who go out and lobby against it.
[01:26:49.449 --> 01:26:53.192]  And then they themselves sit back and make fun of the very groups they financed.
[01:26:53.853 --> 01:26:54.774]  I mean, this is on record.
[01:26:57.159 --> 01:26:59.420]  So that's how they create that artificial scarcity.
[01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:02.501]  And I, this is no exaggeration.
[01:27:02.721 --> 01:27:09.623]  I pulled up by that big refinery right before you get on 37 to go north.
[01:27:10.663 --> 01:27:19.566]  I pulled up, I got out with a video camera on a tripod and filmed the refinery.
[01:27:21.626 --> 01:27:22.767]  I cut down a side street.
[01:27:23.851 --> 01:27:24.071]  I don't
[01:27:46.235 --> 01:27:54.639]  entrance ramp was a Texas State Police officer who got right up on my butt, ran my plates, put me in a database, then peeled off.
[01:27:55.159 --> 01:27:55.959]  Didn't pull me over.
[01:27:56.679 --> 01:27:59.160]  That is infrastructure protection.
[01:28:00.821 --> 01:28:02.962]  They're watching everything, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:04.242 --> 01:28:09.425]  And they tell those poor state police guys, Al-Qaeda is going to blow up the chemical plant.
[01:28:10.065 --> 01:28:11.245]  Give me a break.
[01:28:13.186 --> 01:28:15.027]  But they can't stop the open border.
[01:28:18.942 --> 01:28:25.386]  So the same thing happened to this PBS photographer, and that's in the news.
[01:28:26.047 --> 01:28:28.648]  But I'm already burning time up here, and I said I'd go to your phone calls.
[01:28:28.668 --> 01:28:31.990]  I'm going to at least get to Tim, Ron, Michael, Pastor, and Coyote.
[01:28:32.171 --> 01:28:35.933]  But be ready with your points, folks, because I've got to get to this police state news.
[01:28:35.993 --> 01:28:39.155]  But continuing here.
[01:28:41.256 --> 01:28:42.777]  Okay, what number had I gotten to?
[01:28:47.130 --> 01:28:52.451]  The six biggest banks in the United States now possess assets equivalent to 60% of America's gross national product.
[01:28:53.112 --> 01:28:54.792]  Number 22, four of the biggest U.S.
[01:28:54.832 --> 01:29:03.074]  banks, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup, had a perfect quarter with zero days of trading losses during the first quarter of 2010.
[01:29:03.434 --> 01:29:05.875]  Yeah, it's completely rigged.
[01:29:07.115 --> 01:29:08.975]  These companies are the CIA.
[01:29:11.836 --> 01:29:14.597]  Or properly said, the CIA is Goldman Sachs.
[01:29:15.919 --> 01:29:20.380]  You notice the Russians didn't infiltrate the government.
[01:29:20.420 --> 01:29:23.661]  They infiltrated Harvard and Goldman Sachs and Wall Street.
[01:29:26.062 --> 01:29:27.262]  They're agents of influence.
[01:29:28.242 --> 01:29:30.003]  And the media is saying, well, they should be let go.
[01:29:30.023 --> 01:29:35.524]  Yeah, they're illegal aliens who had fake names and probably were spies, but they just wanted to be bankers' friends.
[01:29:35.985 --> 01:29:38.585]  Well, you don't infiltrate the government!
[01:29:39.966 --> 01:29:44.267]  The congressmen are all like fish on a trotline hook to the bankers.
[01:29:46.104 --> 01:29:48.571]  So you cozy up to them, the dirtbags.
[01:29:49.995 --> 01:29:51.579]  They've already taken America over.
[01:29:53.717 --> 01:29:56.858]  See how this is all hidden in plain view?
[01:29:56.878 --> 01:30:02.321]  1.41 million Americans filed for personal bankruptcy in 2009, a 32% increase over 2008.
[01:30:03.041 --> 01:30:08.763]  BP has hired private security contractors to keep American people away from oil cleanup sites and nobody seems to care.
[01:30:09.103 --> 01:30:09.303]  Number 20.
[01:30:09.343 --> 01:30:11.224]  Yeah, the cops just follow orders.
[01:30:11.404 --> 01:30:12.105]  There's no law.
[01:30:12.825 --> 01:30:15.986]  Just like there's no law Obama can tell the states they can't clean up the oil.
[01:30:16.446 --> 01:30:17.787]  But everybody just bootlecks.
[01:30:18.687 --> 01:30:20.928]  Oh, you say you have authority?
[01:30:21.188 --> 01:30:21.969]  Take my farm.
[01:30:22.029 --> 01:30:22.669]  Take my ranch.
[01:30:25.745 --> 01:30:35.337]  Barack Obama, number 19, is calling for a civilian expeditionary force to be sent to Afghanistan and Iraq to help overburdened military troops build infrastructure.
[01:30:35.797 --> 01:30:39.322]  And he's calling for a draft, just like his chief of staff is, Rahm Emanuel.
[01:30:40.583 --> 01:30:41.544]  Oh, you don't believe me?
[01:30:41.584 --> 01:30:44.148]  Just go search engine, Rahm Emanuel calls for national draft.
[01:30:45.214 --> 01:30:54.066]  On June 18th, two Christians decided that they would peacefully pass out copies of the Gospel of John on a public sidewalk outside of an Arab festival in Dearborn, Michigan.
[01:30:54.446 --> 01:30:58.091]  And within three minutes, eight policemen surrounded them and placed them under arrest.
[01:30:58.131 --> 01:30:58.332]  Number 18.
[01:31:00.294 --> 01:31:02.555]  This story has links to mainstream news everywhere.
[01:31:02.915 --> 01:31:03.896]  See, it's all over.
[01:31:04.156 --> 01:31:08.018]  You come to a town that's Muslim, no free speech if they don't like what you say.
[01:31:08.438 --> 01:31:12.280]  You come to a town that's mainly Jewish, no free speech if you talk bad about Jews.
[01:31:13.061 --> 01:31:18.724]  You come to a town where, you know, it's run by Baptists, you talk bad about the Baptist Church, you get arrested.
[01:31:19.204 --> 01:31:20.224]  I mean, this is a mirror.
[01:31:21.505 --> 01:31:23.247]  Into how censorship and tyranny works.
[01:31:23.627 --> 01:31:31.053]  And then the Feds come in and take over your town, which they're doing, and whatever they say they don't like you to say is now illegal, as Cass Sunstein calls for.
[01:31:31.073 --> 01:31:41.961]  I mean, here's America, open to the whole world, and you go to Dearborn, Michigan, and they got the minarets up and the call to prayer and everything, and what, Christians aren't allowed to be on the street handing out flyers?
[01:31:42.561 --> 01:31:44.103]  Christians aren't allowed to in Dallas!
[01:31:44.503 --> 01:31:49.147]  Daryl Rundus has been arrested repeatedly for standing on the sidewalk handing out flyers in America.
[01:31:49.983 --> 01:31:54.964]  Because it's Americans they've got to keep down.
[01:31:55.004 --> 01:31:59.245]  The system says, my gosh, somebody actually involved trying to be out here in free speech?
[01:31:59.285 --> 01:32:02.866]  We better make them shut up, because mafia runs this country.
[01:32:03.986 --> 01:32:06.366]  You don't let slaves get out there and speak to others.
[01:32:07.387 --> 01:32:14.148]  Those little puny ants outnumber the globalists 100 to 1, and if they ever figure that out, it's over for the grasshoppers.
[01:32:17.662 --> 01:32:18.723]  I can't believe that story.
[01:32:18.783 --> 01:32:23.965]  In fact, I want to get those Christians on who couldn't hand out flyers outside the Dearborn, Michigan facility.
[01:32:25.766 --> 01:32:29.248]  The cops don't care if they're on a sidewalk and it's America and there's free speech.
[01:32:29.268 --> 01:32:30.668]  They arrest you.
[01:32:33.350 --> 01:32:35.631]  They were arrested for the free speech.
[01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:45.782]  17, it's been reported that sales of foreclosed homes in Florida made up nearly 40% of all home purchases in the past part of the year.
[01:32:45.822 --> 01:32:47.663]  Yeah, the banks are buying it up.
[01:32:47.723 --> 01:32:50.303]  Somebody put $200,000 in a house, they get it for $5,000.
[01:32:51.644 --> 01:33:00.366]  During a recent interview with Larry King, former First Lady Laura Bush revealed that the world that she is actually in favor of legalized gay marriages and a woman's right for abortion.
[01:33:00.406 --> 01:33:01.466]  Well, they're not conservatives.
[01:33:02.759 --> 01:33:14.243]  Number 15, scientists at Columbia University are warning that the dose of radiation from the new full-body scanners going into airports all over the country could be up to 20 times higher than originally estimated.
[01:33:14.764 --> 01:33:16.304]  I told you that two years ago.
[01:33:16.404 --> 01:33:18.205]  It's meant to fry your DNA.
[01:33:18.545 --> 01:33:20.426]  It's targeting your ovaries and your testicles.
[01:33:20.786 --> 01:33:22.346]  It's high-powered!
[01:33:23.627 --> 01:33:24.567]  And they're recording it!
[01:33:25.047 --> 01:33:25.848]  You don't care, though.
[01:33:25.888 --> 01:33:27.848]  Your religion is submitting to tyranny?
[01:33:28.469 --> 01:33:31.890]  I'm surprised people don't go in there naked, saying, please, kill me.
[01:33:34.980 --> 01:33:38.542]  And again, that's scientists at Columbia University, and there's a bunch of other studies saying that.
[01:33:38.562 --> 01:33:39.122]  They don't care.
[01:33:39.562 --> 01:33:40.103]  Fourteen.
[01:33:42.004 --> 01:33:45.586]  Forty-three percent of Americans have less than $10,000 saved for retirement.
[01:33:47.327 --> 01:33:54.670]  The FDIC's deposit insurance fund now has negative $20.7 billion in it, which represents a slight improvement from the end of 2009.
[01:33:56.752 --> 01:34:09.960]  Number 12, the judge that BP is pushing to hear the estimated 200 lawsuits of the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster gets tens of thousands of dollars a year in oil royalties and has paid travel expenses to industry conferences by BP.
[01:34:13.002 --> 01:34:14.643]  See, corruption is now the law.
[01:34:15.123 --> 01:34:16.043]  Evil is law.
[01:34:17.264 --> 01:34:18.265]  Evil is law.
[01:34:18.825 --> 01:34:22.447]  Degeneracy and wickedness is what's protected.
[01:34:22.827 --> 01:34:23.808]  Goodness is bad.
[01:34:24.749 --> 01:34:25.369]  You understand that?
[01:34:27.415 --> 01:34:30.478]  Because crooks run everything, and they don't like anybody that gets uppity.
[01:34:30.919 --> 01:34:33.141]  It's about all keeping the slaves down.
[01:34:33.561 --> 01:34:35.183]  Not scaring off the fish, you know.
[01:34:35.383 --> 01:34:37.966]  The globalists are basically like fishermen.
[01:34:37.986 --> 01:34:40.708]  They're like, don't bang your oar on the boat.
[01:34:40.728 --> 01:34:42.250]  We're catching these little suckers.
[01:34:43.611 --> 01:34:45.073]  These little stupid little fishies.
[01:34:48.373 --> 01:34:48.894]  Listen to this.
[01:34:49.734 --> 01:34:50.755]  In recent years, the U.S.
[01:34:50.795 --> 01:35:05.010]  government has spent 2.6 million tax dollars to study the drinking habits of Chinese prostitutes and 400,000 tax dollars to pay researchers to cruise six bars in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to find out why gay men engage in risky sexual behavior when drunk.
[01:35:05.899 --> 01:35:09.022]  That's probably figuring out how to put bio weapons in their food or something.
[01:35:09.042 --> 01:35:09.502]  You never know.
[01:35:09.762 --> 01:35:11.984]  I mean, you know, they'll hire somebody for a weird study.
[01:35:12.004 --> 01:35:12.885]  They don't know why they're doing it.
[01:35:12.925 --> 01:35:16.348]  And that's used by the CIA later to carry out some type of operation.
[01:35:16.648 --> 01:35:19.111]  That was just randomly throwing out, you know, a possibility.
[01:35:19.131 --> 01:35:21.352]  I'm not saying that's what's happening here.
[01:35:21.393 --> 01:35:23.695]  I'm saying it's been declassified.
[01:35:23.715 --> 01:35:30.921]  They used gay men getting hepatitis shots in New York in the 70s to give them the HIV because they knew they would spread it.
[01:35:35.965 --> 01:35:37.427]  Okay, continuing here.
[01:35:38.668 --> 01:35:39.509]  Number 10, U.S.
[01:35:39.549 --> 01:35:45.075]  officials say more than $3 billion in cash, much of it aid money paid by U.S.
[01:35:45.535 --> 01:35:50.861]  taxpayers, has been stolen by corrupt officials in Afghanistan and flown out to Kabul International Airport in recent years.
[01:35:50.881 --> 01:35:52.763]  Well, that's all by design.
[01:35:54.245 --> 01:35:55.686]  They openly grow the opium over there.
[01:35:55.706 --> 01:35:56.407]  The troops grow it.
[01:35:56.747 --> 01:35:57.147]  Number 9.
[01:35:57.187 --> 01:35:58.428]  According to a report by U.S.
[01:35:58.448 --> 01:36:03.753]  Department of Transportation Bureau of Transportation Statistics, the baggage check fees collected by U.S.
[01:36:03.833 --> 01:36:10.137]  airlines shot up 33% in the first quarter of 2010 to $769 million.
[01:36:10.518 --> 01:36:10.998]  Number 3.
[01:36:11.338 --> 01:36:21.606]  California high school students are fighting for their right to show their American patriotism, even on a Mexican holiday, after they were forced to remove their American flag t-shirts on Cinco de Mayo.
[01:36:22.127 --> 01:36:23.608]  That's now been happening nationwide.
[01:36:25.528 --> 01:36:27.809]  Number seven, right now, interest in U.S.
[01:36:27.869 --> 01:36:37.074]  national debt and spending on entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare are somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 to 15 percent of the GDP.
[01:36:37.134 --> 01:36:41.056]  By 2080, they were projected to eat up approximately 50 percent of the GDP.
[01:36:41.576 --> 01:36:46.979]  Number six, the total of government and corporate consumer debt in the United States is now at 360 percent of GDP.
[01:36:50.811 --> 01:36:53.873]  You understand it's three times GDP plus.
[01:36:54.433 --> 01:37:00.116]  Number five, a six-year-old girl was recently handcuffed and sent to a mental facility after throwing temper tantrums in her elementary school.
[01:37:01.577 --> 01:37:10.983]  Number four, in Florida students have been arrested by police for things as simple as bringing a plastic butter knife to school, throwing an eraser, or drawing a picture of a gun.
[01:37:11.563 --> 01:37:11.943]  Oh yeah!
[01:37:13.624 --> 01:37:18.227]  Number three, school officials in one town in Massachusetts are refusing to allow students to recite the Pledge of Allegiance.
[01:37:19.537 --> 01:37:24.838]  Number two, according to one new study, approximately 21% of children in the United States are living below the poverty level.
[01:37:27.159 --> 01:37:32.540]  Since 1973, more than 50 million babies have been murdered in abortion facilities across the United States.
[01:37:33.860 --> 01:37:36.461]  See, if they can sell you abortion, they can sell you anything.
[01:37:36.741 --> 01:37:38.081]  Let's go to your calls right now.
[01:37:38.361 --> 01:37:39.561]  Tim in Michigan, you're on the air.
[01:37:40.902 --> 01:37:41.502]  Hey Alex!
[01:37:41.922 --> 01:37:42.302]  Hey buddy!
[01:37:43.162 --> 01:37:45.223]  Hey man, thanks for taking my call again.
[01:37:45.343 --> 01:37:45.663]  Listen,
[01:37:47.148 --> 01:37:49.790]  First off, I got three things I really want to cover.
[01:37:50.631 --> 01:38:10.486]  There was a interview that Bill Clinton gave, who he was just totally giving BP the props, and his exact statement was, I can't wait to get into your gas tank.
[01:38:13.530 --> 01:38:17.858]  Whoever found this well from BP knew exactly what they were doing.
[01:38:18.519 --> 01:38:19.881]  This thing is a gusher.
[01:38:19.901 --> 01:38:25.531]  He never talked about the people.
[01:38:27.228 --> 01:38:39.232]  You affected the economy, you never talked about... No, it's all... Listen, we played a clip of Obama earlier, even though they admit all these people are dying, getting sick, almost all the people from the Exxon Valdez are dead.
[01:38:39.652 --> 01:38:41.913]  They know it's very toxic to have people cleaning this up.
[01:38:42.313 --> 01:38:48.735]  Now it's going to come into shore and Obama's on TV saying no ill health effects, no problems, just lying.
[01:38:49.055 --> 01:38:50.336]  What's the name of that video, Tim?
[01:38:52.060 --> 01:39:03.963]  I'm not exactly sure, but if you Google Bill Clinton giving interview for BP, I'm sure it'll pop up on YouTube.
[01:39:04.043 --> 01:39:05.743]  Okay, we'll try to get it posted.
[01:39:05.763 --> 01:39:06.283]  Thank you, Tim.
[01:39:06.763 --> 01:39:08.084]  Ron in Arizona, you're on the air.
[01:39:08.124 --> 01:39:08.704]  Go ahead, Ron.
[01:39:10.344 --> 01:39:12.845]  Good afternoon, Alex and Patriots.
[01:39:14.505 --> 01:39:18.486]  They haven't been spraying chemtrails in Pescat, Arizona.
[01:39:19.073 --> 01:39:19.414]  I don't
[01:39:28.095 --> 01:39:29.997]  He is not an American citizen.
[01:39:30.077 --> 01:39:35.021]  He is a foreign agent working for the international banksters.
[01:39:35.301 --> 01:39:37.643]  I agree, but it's espionage.
[01:39:38.083 --> 01:39:39.965]  And if people get one message, it's this.
[01:39:40.045 --> 01:39:41.346]  Globalism is tyranny.
[01:39:41.666 --> 01:39:45.369]  It is foreign banking, corporate takeovers through fraud.
[01:39:45.810 --> 01:39:47.131]  It is espionage.
[01:39:47.431 --> 01:39:49.293]  And so all these corporate officials
[01:39:49.693 --> 01:40:01.863]  that are here in the US conspiring to defraud the taxpayers are enemy operatives and they need to be seized immediately and given a trial and then they need to be dealt with.
[01:40:01.923 --> 01:40:02.303]  Go ahead.
[01:40:02.804 --> 01:40:04.605]  I agree with you, Alex.
[01:40:04.665 --> 01:40:15.314]  I just ask you to make that point clear because he is a foreign agent working for foreign banksters who are trying to destroy this country.
[01:40:15.334 --> 01:40:17.596]  And the last thing is there's an ancient Hebrew
[01:40:18.237 --> 01:40:19.137]  We're good to go.
[01:40:39.355 --> 01:40:48.404]  Get the women out of Congress, put men back in, and quit relying on women to save us, because the Bible says that is not going to save us.
[01:40:49.245 --> 01:40:50.687]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[01:40:50.867 --> 01:40:51.568]  I know this.
[01:40:51.748 --> 01:40:54.270]  There are a lot of really smart, intelligent women.
[01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:55.712]  There are women smarter than I am.
[01:40:56.112 --> 01:40:56.813]  A lot smarter.
[01:40:58.495 --> 01:40:59.696]  But men and women are different.
[01:41:02.998 --> 01:41:06.680]  There has never been a society that has done the things we're doing that survived.
[01:41:06.700 --> 01:41:07.621]  And we're going to collapse.
[01:41:07.701 --> 01:41:09.482]  I mean, people don't like to hear it.
[01:41:09.522 --> 01:41:10.503]  They don't like to know it.
[01:41:11.083 --> 01:41:14.586]  But human society is supposed to work a certain way.
[01:41:15.626 --> 01:41:16.967]  And it's been destroyed.
[01:41:17.027 --> 01:41:18.008]  And the family's gone.
[01:41:18.468 --> 01:41:19.249]  No one's secure.
[01:41:19.369 --> 01:41:24.512]  Our women, under feminism, have been turned into totally insecure trollops, dressed up like whores.
[01:41:25.113 --> 01:41:27.434]  Our children are dying and on drugs.
[01:41:27.474 --> 01:41:28.335]  And we're destroyed.
[01:41:28.995 --> 01:41:32.358]  Hitler said, first you get the women, then you got the children, so follow the men.
[01:41:33.138 --> 01:41:34.319]  It's not that women are bad.
[01:41:35.700 --> 01:41:36.921]  Any more bad than men.
[01:41:37.461 --> 01:41:39.903]  It's that women want security.
[01:41:40.483 --> 01:41:46.247]  And women tend to, in history, be very trusting of government.
[01:41:47.488 --> 01:41:48.889]  And they statistically are today.
[01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:54.413]  And so, over 80% of purchases are decided by women.
[01:41:54.673 --> 01:41:55.794]  What color is the furniture?
[01:41:55.834 --> 01:41:56.815]  What color are the drapes?
[01:41:57.175 --> 01:41:58.136]  What brand of milk?
[01:41:58.176 --> 01:41:59.156]  What brand of eggs?
[01:41:59.176 --> 01:42:01.078]  I mean, women make the... My wife
[01:42:02.168 --> 01:42:03.469]  Makes almost all the decisions.
[01:42:03.889 --> 01:42:05.570]  I'm here working, working on this.
[01:42:05.630 --> 01:42:08.171]  My wife probably makes 90% of the decisions.
[01:42:08.771 --> 01:42:11.292]  And if somebody could get control of my wife, they'd run my house.
[01:42:12.013 --> 01:42:13.013]  They would run my life.
[01:42:14.554 --> 01:42:19.697]  And that's why Hitler said, first you get the women, you got the children, so follow the men.
[01:42:19.737 --> 01:42:21.117]  That's an exact quotation.
[01:42:21.938 --> 01:42:23.578]  And Goebbels was obsessed with it.
[01:42:23.979 --> 01:42:26.580]  First you get the women, then you've got the children, so follow the men.
[01:42:28.300 --> 01:42:30.082]  And they've got the women, folks.
[01:42:30.222 --> 01:42:35.166]  I mean, the women support the CPS because they think, oh, the CPS is helping the children.
[01:42:36.627 --> 01:42:40.451]  Meanwhile, the CPS is hunting women, hunting, you know, taking their kids.
[01:42:40.951 --> 01:42:41.472]  It's admitted.
[01:42:44.011 --> 01:42:46.754]  And it doesn't mean men aren't lazy and gullible and dumb.
[01:42:46.834 --> 01:42:48.896]  It's just that there's a natural order of things.
[01:42:49.636 --> 01:42:51.698]  And so don't worry, America's gone completely down.
[01:42:52.139 --> 01:42:53.340]  We're all completely screwed.
[01:42:53.940 --> 01:42:59.606]  And it will be a bunch of people like Andrew Napolitano and all those hunchbacked women they got in the Supreme Court ruling us.
[01:43:00.286 --> 01:43:09.372]  Global meltdowns, massive unemployment, endless wars, a new currency crisis, financially and morally bankrupt, a great and terrible storm is approaching.
[01:43:09.512 --> 01:43:12.854]  So what's the best way to get ready to get prepared for hard times ahead?

[01:43:43.647 --> 01:43:48.128]  And the best part, this $100 a year service is now free of charge for our listeners.
[01:43:48.268 --> 01:43:48.728]  That's right.

[01:44:00.546 --> 01:44:05.389]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:44:05.509 --> 01:44:06.270]  What have we got?
[01:44:06.490 --> 01:44:08.631]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:44:08.952 --> 01:44:09.692]  A republic.
[01:44:09.952 --> 01:44:12.534]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:44:12.594 --> 01:44:14.515]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:44:14.855 --> 01:44:16.777]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:44:16.897 --> 01:44:18.158]  So they think they own our land?
[01:44:18.578 --> 01:44:19.699]  They think they own our water?
[01:44:19.899 --> 01:44:20.299]  Children?
[01:44:20.499 --> 01:44:21.280]  Our education?
[01:44:21.620 --> 01:44:22.240]  Our money?
[01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:26.103]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:44:26.463 --> 01:44:31.128]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:44:31.429 --> 01:44:32.250]  We have the facts.
[01:44:32.450 --> 01:44:33.571]  We have the Constitution.
[01:44:33.631 --> 01:44:34.492]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:44:34.532 --> 01:44:35.353]  We have common law.
[01:44:35.413 --> 01:44:37.675]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44:37.936 --> 01:44:41.720]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:44:41.820 --> 01:44:46.602]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:44:46.762 --> 01:44:48.143]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:44:48.263 --> 01:44:49.103]  Don't tread on me.

[01:45:18.871 --> 01:45:22.954]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?

[01:45:55.232 --> 01:45:56.572]  That's 800-477-9256.
[01:45:56.852 --> 01:46:08.975]  Look at this AP headline, Army Drops PsyOps Name From Influence Operations.
[01:46:09.575 --> 01:46:14.136]  The Army has dropped the Vietnam era name, Psychological Operations, or its branch
[01:46:15.353 --> 01:46:18.059]  That is in charge of changing minds by enemy lines.
[01:46:18.660 --> 01:46:20.785]  Acknowledging the term can sound ominous.
[01:46:21.346 --> 01:46:23.831]  What do you think hydrogen bombs dropping on you is?
[01:46:24.052 --> 01:46:24.352]  Ominous?
[01:46:26.323 --> 01:46:29.005]  What do you think a Hellfire missile shooting into your mud hut is?
[01:46:29.185 --> 01:46:29.465]  Ominous?
[01:46:29.965 --> 01:46:33.128]  That's what the Pentagon does, is it dominates and controls.
[01:46:33.848 --> 01:46:36.950]  And the Pentagon admits it now works for Wall Street.
[01:46:36.970 --> 01:46:37.831]  And what is Wall Street?
[01:46:37.851 --> 01:46:50.760]  A bunch of inbred bankers who think that we should all basically die because they have Ponzi-schemed all the wealth of the world into their hands, but they did it through fraud, and so they need to get rid of us so they can enjoy it all.
[01:46:51.724 --> 01:46:59.488]  And they're in control of killers that have bioweapons that can kill even subgroups in the human race.
[01:47:00.969 --> 01:47:03.351]  By subgroups, I mean even down to villages.
[01:47:05.112 --> 01:47:08.593]  Even down to just very delicate genetic variations.
[01:47:12.496 --> 01:47:17.138]  It's like they've got hundreds of species of perch, and most of them are subspecies.
[01:47:17.158 --> 01:47:18.039]  That's what I mean by that.
[01:47:19.090 --> 01:47:21.591]  They've got bioweapons where they can tailor it right down.
[01:47:22.051 --> 01:47:23.812]  You're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:47:23.892 --> 01:47:25.352]  Big decisions have been made.
[01:47:26.192 --> 01:47:31.334]  They don't want six, seven, eight billion of you sucking your thumbs watching football, folks.
[01:47:31.354 --> 01:47:32.635]  They want you deader than a hammer.
[01:47:33.115 --> 01:47:35.776]  And I know most of you are so brain damaged and so chemically.
[01:47:36.756 --> 01:47:41.719]  Lobotomize, you can't even understand me right now, but we've got listeners who do care and are involved.
[01:47:41.739 --> 01:47:48.143]  You know, I said I'd get to this, and I'm going to cover it at the start of the show because I want to be able to go to Coyote and Michael and Pastor.
[01:47:48.183 --> 01:47:50.965]  I mean, just look at all these articles I didn't get to.
[01:47:53.926 --> 01:47:56.068]  I've got a whole bunch of police state articles here.
[01:47:57.328 --> 01:47:59.490]  The First Amendment has been suspended, CNN.
[01:47:59.750 --> 01:48:00.730]  That's their story.
[01:48:01.451 --> 01:48:04.893]  BP, Homeland Security, and cops worked together to deny First Amendment.
[01:48:05.649 --> 01:48:06.729]  In a three-state area.
[01:48:07.410 --> 01:48:08.110]  There's no law.
[01:48:08.150 --> 01:48:08.830]  They just do it.
[01:48:08.870 --> 01:48:09.671]  It's called tyranny.
[01:48:11.111 --> 01:48:14.533]  BP cops detain reporter for taking pictures of oil refinery in Houston.
[01:48:14.933 --> 01:48:18.794]  Not allowed for PBS to cover something.
[01:48:19.835 --> 01:48:23.096]  Spy tech that monitors conversations being launched in Europe report.
[01:48:23.476 --> 01:48:24.057]  Raw story.
[01:48:24.497 --> 01:48:26.978]  This is out of a bunch of other mainstream articles.
[01:48:28.707 --> 01:48:34.232]  They used to call them gunshot detectors, but now they admit the NSA is recording everything and running it through a database.
[01:48:34.652 --> 01:48:36.313]  I'll cover this tomorrow, it's so important.
[01:48:37.574 --> 01:48:39.236]  I gotta give each caller one minute now.
[01:48:40.737 --> 01:48:42.178]  Coyote in Colorado, go ahead.
[01:48:42.778 --> 01:48:43.439]  Coyote, go ahead.
[01:48:43.839 --> 01:48:45.581]  Hey Alex, Coyote.
[01:48:45.961 --> 01:48:46.621]  Hey buddy, what's up?
[01:48:47.602 --> 01:48:48.783]  Oh, not a whole heck of a lot.
[01:48:49.243 --> 01:48:55.929]  Anyway, Matt Ryan has an incredible article on InfoWars that people need to go to.
[01:48:56.756 --> 01:48:59.979]  It's called, Why Are Police Abusing the Elderly?
[01:49:00.939 --> 01:49:05.122]  And it's an incredible article, people need to go in and read it and comment.
[01:49:05.883 --> 01:49:18.392]  Also, the Core-X at 9500 dispersion that BP is using on the oil spill, it literally disperses
[01:49:19.406 --> 01:49:30.211]  The oil into the water, it becomes soluble in water and makes it impossible for oil booms or for skimmers to remove the oil.
[01:49:30.331 --> 01:49:32.752]  It is the worst thing that they could be doing right now.
[01:49:32.832 --> 01:49:42.997]  Now I've seen a lot of experts in this saying that and it's so toxic and it allows in a lot of the base elements that are poisonous, the heavy metals, the
[01:49:44.747 --> 01:49:50.432]  Other chemicals to then become soluble in water so that it can be lifted up into the atmosphere.
[01:49:51.452 --> 01:49:51.953]  Exactly.
[01:49:52.093 --> 01:50:03.662]  And not only that, once, well, when it evaporates, it becomes part of the ecosystem and it also becomes part of the water table, especially in estuaries.
[01:50:04.162 --> 01:50:07.385]  And then all the birds and the wildlife there pick this stuff up.
[01:50:08.413 --> 01:50:11.735]  And it just, it permeates the entire life cycle.
[01:50:27.017 --> 01:50:27.658]  I'm out of time.
[01:50:27.678 --> 01:50:28.879]  Great job to the crew.
[01:50:28.919 --> 01:50:30.180]  Great job to all the affiliates.
[01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:34.024]  We can save humanity if we face up to how evil the elite are.
[01:50:34.404 --> 01:50:35.085]  Please, folks.
[01:50:35.185 --> 01:50:36.426]  It's so hardcore.
[01:50:36.706 --> 01:50:38.328]  You've got to face all the facts.
[01:50:38.348 --> 01:50:44.454]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
