[00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:09.706]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.706 --> 00:00:11.288]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.288 --> 00:00:12.829]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:17.014]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.014 --> 00:00:21.078]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.542 --> 00:00:29.607]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, powerful transmission lined up for you today.
[00:00:29.607 --> 00:00:31.989]  It is the second day of December, 2010.
[00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:36.473]  We're going to be live here for at least the next three hours.
[00:00:36.473 --> 00:00:41.458]  We may even go into overdrive today, because at the end of the show, Max Keiser is going to be popping in.
[00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:54.575]  I got up this morning and noticed Zero Hedge, Tyler Durgan, Max Keiser's plan to destroy JP Morgan goes mainstream after the Guardians post his silver squeeze thoughts.
[00:00:55.723 --> 00:00:56.184]  And it's now
[00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.210]  I don't know.
[00:01:35.868 --> 00:01:44.952]  So Max is going to be popping in the last 20 minutes of this transmission today to get into that and what the ramifications of this are.
[00:01:44.952 --> 00:01:48.573]  I mean, he just mentioned it on this show, I don't know, three weeks ago.
[00:01:48.573 --> 00:01:50.954]  Then we talked about it again last week.
[00:01:50.954 --> 00:01:55.636]  And now it is on fire on the Internet, on fire.
[00:01:55.636 --> 00:01:58.297]  And I said I would do this yesterday, but I didn't.
[00:01:59.364 --> 00:02:22.221]  I will play some YouTube videos that I've seen from some of the most active people out there who are talking about holding physical silver and bringing down the globalists, not just JP Morgan, who's been caught repeatedly manipulating and suppressing the price of silver so that it doesn't show up their fiat paper currency scam.
[00:02:22.221 --> 00:02:27.665]  But the bankers are certainly waging war on us, so we need to stand up and fight back against them.
[00:02:27.665 --> 00:02:28.806]  Joe Sihusen.
[00:02:30.047 --> 00:02:31.528]  We'll be joining us.
[00:02:31.528 --> 00:02:33.810]  Jaren, did I get that name pronounced right?
[00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:34.270]  I did!
[00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.952]  I did it!
[00:02:35.952 --> 00:02:37.353]  Wow!
[00:02:37.353 --> 00:02:38.574]  He'll be joining us.
[00:02:38.574 --> 00:02:44.199]  He is the director underneath the founder of Liberty Guard.
[00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:48.263]  He's the CEO of Liberty Guard, a kind of libertarian-styled
[00:02:51.795 --> 00:02:55.478]  Organizations similar to what the ACLU does.
[00:02:55.478 --> 00:03:02.144]  He's the president of Liberty Guard, and they've filed the four-year request to find out about, well, two big things.
[00:03:02.144 --> 00:03:14.394]  The confirmed TSA stand-down of National Opt-Out Day last Wednesday, the day before Thanksgiving, to shut down the protest.
[00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:18.417]  And the watchdog, of course, is probing DHS spying on Drudge.
[00:03:19.824 --> 00:03:25.730]  PrisonPlanet.com, Matt Drudge, Alex Jones, and of course, others.
[00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:32.397]  Mr. Tyner, who coined the term, don't touch my junk or I'll call the police on you.
[00:03:32.397 --> 00:03:34.820]  So he's going to be popping in.
[00:03:36.141 --> 00:03:40.327]  For about 15-20 minutes in the middle of the next hour.
[00:03:40.327 --> 00:03:45.193]  We will have open phones today on any issue or subject you wish to discuss.
[00:03:45.193 --> 00:03:52.282]  We also have Michael Braverman coming on for about 30 minutes, one of the producers of Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura.
[00:03:53.443 --> 00:03:59.046]  Uh, they've got all the best episodes on the second half of the season, in my opinion, and Michael tends to agree.
[00:03:59.046 --> 00:04:01.608]  That's just how the network decided to air them.
[00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:07.271]  Obviously, the police state episode was groundbreaking with the FEMA camps, the JFK episode a few weeks ago was groundbreaking.
[00:04:07.271 --> 00:04:11.153]  They did a rebroadcast of an older show the day after Thanksgiving, or on Thanksgiving.
[00:04:13.328 --> 00:04:15.629]  Uh, or that day over Thanksgiving on that Friday.
[00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:21.492]  Today they're doing one on the secrets of water, how the globalists are buying up all the water and what they're adding to it.
[00:04:21.492 --> 00:04:23.653]  Not just fluoride, but uranium.
[00:04:24.724 --> 00:04:32.852]  And I'm authorized to tell you now, that's in tomorrow's show coming up, but I gave them a lot of intel, but they dug up stuff I didn't even know.
[00:04:32.852 --> 00:04:45.665]  Or I didn't know when they were consulting with me a few months ago, I simultaneously learned about the uranium a few weeks ago, after they discovered it, and I didn't know that was in the episode until I talked to Michael yesterday, the uranium they're putting in the water.
[00:04:46.586 --> 00:04:55.056]  So big breaking news today here first ahead of tomorrow night on TruTV with Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura.
[00:04:55.056 --> 00:04:57.639]  That's coming up and obviously the big banking news.
[00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:58.820]  We'll get into that straight ahead.
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:59.261]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.352 --> 00:05:04.073]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:04.073 --> 00:05:09.795]  You've heard me talk about the delicious, easy-to-fix, and very storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:05:09.795 --> 00:05:14.557]  I've told you for years that eFoodsDirect has the best storable food on the planet.
[00:05:14.557 --> 00:05:18.299]  Now it's that time of year again, and their holiday special is here.

[00:07:03.944 --> 00:07:10.349]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:07:10.349 --> 00:07:17.735]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:07:17.735 --> 00:07:22.619]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:07:31.266 --> 00:07:34.990]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:07:35.529 --> 00:07:42.293]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:07:42.293 --> 00:07:46.196]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:07:46.196 --> 00:07:53.160]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:53.761]  Thank you.
[00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:05.641]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.641 --> 00:08:07.926]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:24.873 --> 00:08:26.533]  We are live, my friends.
[00:08:26.533 --> 00:08:28.213]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:08:28.213 --> 00:08:33.895]  It is Thursday, the second day of December 2010.
[00:08:33.895 --> 00:08:39.956]  Max Keiser is coming up about the London Guardian report, covering his plan to crash
[00:08:42.082 --> 00:08:45.344]  JPMorgan by holding physical silver.
[00:08:45.344 --> 00:09:01.675]  We've got Michael Braverman coming on to get into the secrets of water, not just the fluoride being added, not just the globalist attempt to corner the water market and to take it all over, not just here, but worldwide, but also to add uranium and other goodies to it.
[00:09:01.675 --> 00:09:09.881]  So next they'll tell us uranium is good for our teeth probably and have TV ads and say you're a conspiracy theorist if you don't like drinking uranium.
[00:09:09.881 --> 00:09:11.642]  So that is all coming up.
[00:09:12.482 --> 00:09:23.712]  There's a new video that's embedded in an article up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com that we're going to be playing later here in its entirety at the start of the next hour.
[00:09:23.712 --> 00:09:27.855]  And I want to kick off with the article that goes along with it first.
[00:09:27.855 --> 00:09:29.596]  It's the bankers or us.
[00:09:29.596 --> 00:09:33.079]  That's the headline by an article by myself and Aaron Dykes.
[00:09:33.079 --> 00:09:37.063]  The austerity hammer starts to fall in the United States as debt consumes Europe.
[00:09:38.104 --> 00:09:41.645]  And on the heels of all of this being announced, what do we learn?
[00:09:41.645 --> 00:09:49.287]  Well, for our audience, we didn't learn really much new except for the fact that private U.S.
[00:09:49.287 --> 00:10:02.570]  corporations that weren't even connected to finance companies were given hundreds of millions, in some cases, and tens of billions, in other cases, of taxpayer money
[00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:10.353]  During the banker bailout of 2008 that continued right through from Bush into Obama.
[00:10:10.353 --> 00:10:15.055]  And one of the biggest recipients was MSNBC and NBC television.
[00:10:15.055 --> 00:10:16.795]  Both broadcast and cable.
[00:10:16.795 --> 00:10:20.857]  No wonder they say you're a Nazi if you don't want government-run healthcare.
[00:10:20.857 --> 00:10:23.118]  No wonder they're so cartoonish.
[00:10:24.383 --> 00:10:34.191]  Because 100%, Chris Matthews, Rachel Maddow, all of them, they are paid off by the federal government.
[00:10:34.191 --> 00:10:38.755]  And by the way, this payoff is taking place during Bush.
[00:10:38.755 --> 00:10:44.741]  Remember how it was real strange when Bush was in, MSNBC was still somewhat positive, and then Obama gets in, they're even more positive?
[00:10:44.741 --> 00:10:45.721]  It is literally
[00:10:46.758 --> 00:10:48.780]  State-run media.
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:53.424]  More than even Russia today had some original government funding to be founded.
[00:10:53.424 --> 00:10:56.387]  I mean, it is literally, covertly run.
[00:10:56.387 --> 00:11:04.555]  At least with things like RT, which covers some fair issues, but also isn't too hardcore when it comes to reporting on the Russian government.
[00:11:06.206 --> 00:11:10.309]  They're out in the open that they had some government funding to be founded.
[00:11:10.309 --> 00:11:17.154]  Here, it's like, oh, there's no government involved in ABC, NBC, CBS, and yes, Fox.
[00:11:17.154 --> 00:11:18.675]  Fox has mainly paid off the...
[00:11:19.795 --> 00:11:24.058]  By their fiction departments.
[00:11:24.058 --> 00:11:26.519]  By Fox TV itself.
[00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:29.401]  That's where a lot of their money comes in.
[00:11:29.401 --> 00:11:34.684]  We've analyzed this, and there's not really much bailout money going to News Corp.
[00:11:34.684 --> 00:11:39.847]  They're getting paid through propaganda placement that Paramount coined over a decade ago.
[00:11:39.847 --> 00:11:45.831]  The government now last year admitted, okay, it's not really propaganda placement, it is behavior placement.
[00:11:46.611 --> 00:11:51.093]  And it was even in the New York Times a few months ago that NBC was getting a lot of that money too.
[00:11:51.093 --> 00:11:57.996]  NBC, of course General Electric, the bomb makers, they are some of the worst out there.
[00:11:57.996 --> 00:12:07.800]  And so we're now just confirming what's in the Obama deception, what's in Follow the Republic, that hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars
[00:12:09.295 --> 00:12:14.979]  The estimates that Tarpley had and the Obama deception are now accurate, proven to be completely accurate.
[00:12:14.979 --> 00:12:20.243]  At least 200 bill, that was in the first phase, went to European banks.
[00:12:21.158 --> 00:12:28.580]  Now, the European press blames the United States for dollar devaluation when a lot of that money's going overseas.
[00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:32.021]  See, this is a global corporate system.
[00:12:32.021 --> 00:12:43.643]  Sucking dry Europe, sucking dry the US, sucking dry Ireland, sucking dry England, sucking dry Eastern Europe, sucking dry Asia, sucking dry Africa, sucking dry Latin America.
[00:12:43.643 --> 00:12:45.044]  It's all the exact same players.
[00:12:46.664 --> 00:12:51.311]  They know how we love to be divided and conquered, so they'll say it's the Europeans' fault.
[00:12:51.311 --> 00:12:52.733]  It's the Americans' fault.
[00:12:52.733 --> 00:12:55.938]  We're all in the same boat together.
[00:12:55.938 --> 00:12:57.160]  And that's what my video...
[00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:00.131]  Covers in detail.
[00:13:00.131 --> 00:13:02.832]  It's the bankers or us.
[00:13:02.832 --> 00:13:06.333]  It's a 15 minute or 14 and a half minute video.
[00:13:06.333 --> 00:13:07.793]  Very important.
[00:13:07.793 --> 00:13:11.175]  Please send this article to everyone you know.
[00:13:11.175 --> 00:13:14.536]  It's the bankers or us.
[00:13:14.536 --> 00:13:15.796]  And I want to commend listeners.
[00:13:15.796 --> 00:13:18.157]  You did it again yesterday.
[00:13:18.157 --> 00:13:26.681]  We had the number one, the number two, the number three, and for a time, the number four top searches in order.
[00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:27.161]  You made
[00:13:28.306 --> 00:13:29.787]  Us, number one, number two, number three.
[00:13:29.787 --> 00:13:32.209]  I thought it was amazing to have number one, number two, number three.
[00:13:32.209 --> 00:13:38.513]  But before I left the office, at about six, I clicked Google Trends.
[00:13:38.513 --> 00:13:41.575]  We had one through four.
[00:13:41.575 --> 00:13:53.083]  And it led them to Google is evil and articles about them stealing your wireless transmissions and using the microphone on board most computers to listen to you in your home, their own admissions, how they're NSA, CIA.
[00:13:56.724 --> 00:14:04.830]  So the three search terms that became number one were Prison Planet, Censored, Google, Evil, and Spying on Drudge.
[00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:09.954]  And it didn't matter if Google banned us from the Google News Feeds.
[00:14:09.954 --> 00:14:18.120]  It didn't matter when you clicked on those terms that you didn't get InfoWars or Prison Planet, because you just got the hundreds of other sites that know now to take our news and post it.
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.181]  We'll just send all the traffic to them.
[00:14:20.181 --> 00:14:22.583]  I don't care about the traffic.
[00:14:22.583 --> 00:14:24.584]  I care about reaching people.
[00:14:24.584 --> 00:14:32.830]  That's why I make films that cost $100, $150,000 and just give them away on the internet for free.
[00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:38.113]  See, they don't know how to deal with our model of resistance.
[00:14:38.113 --> 00:14:39.194]  So today we're going to do it.
[00:14:41.305 --> 00:14:41.945]  We're gonna do it again.
[00:14:41.945 --> 00:14:43.346]  It's bankers or us.
[00:14:43.346 --> 00:14:45.026]  Let's make that number one.
[00:14:45.026 --> 00:14:59.552]  And as long as you never tire of doing this, as long as you have that spirit of eternal resistance to tyranny that Thomas Jefferson talked about, as long as you want freedom more than they want tyranny and to run your life, we will smash these people.
[00:14:59.552 --> 00:15:03.833]  So, let's search the term bankers or us.
[00:15:03.833 --> 00:15:04.814]  Bankers or us.
[00:15:05.914 --> 00:15:14.241]  And then all the other sites listening, you just take BankersRUSH, you post our article and our video, and then you will get all the traffic.
[00:15:14.241 --> 00:15:22.128]  And the video's also called It's the BankersRUSH, and they aren't censoring out their own YouTubes from the feeds, and so our video will go up there as well.
[00:15:22.128 --> 00:15:23.009]  See, that's the answer.
[00:15:23.009 --> 00:15:30.716]  Have our signal going out everywhere, not just out of our capital ships, our flagships of InfoWars and Prison Planet, doesn't matter.
[00:15:30.716 --> 00:15:32.057]  We've got volunteer
[00:15:32.978 --> 00:15:47.309]  Freedom lovers, literal moles of the resistance everywhere, in the FBI, in the CIA, in the federal marshals, in the local police departments, in the media, inside MSNBC.
[00:15:47.309 --> 00:15:52.353]  I got the Popular Mechanics piece a month and a half before it was out publicly.
[00:15:52.353 --> 00:15:53.053]  I got the
[00:15:54.369 --> 00:16:00.570]  Video and the text of the MSNBC hit piece against me a month before it was out.
[00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:03.311]  Half the time I don't even read the stuff because I don't even care.
[00:16:03.311 --> 00:16:04.531]  But it's good that you get it out there.
[00:16:04.531 --> 00:16:05.431]  I mean, I get everything.
[00:16:05.431 --> 00:16:06.171]  It's ridiculous.
[00:16:06.171 --> 00:16:08.892]  I can't even deal with it all, the amount of intelligence we've got.
[00:16:08.892 --> 00:16:11.233]  The amount of people we've got out there.
[00:16:11.233 --> 00:16:12.053]  It's unbelievable.
[00:16:12.053 --> 00:16:15.013]  Look, if something happens to us, something happens to me, it doesn't even matter.
[00:16:15.013 --> 00:16:16.654]  Folks just continue fighting them.
[00:16:16.654 --> 00:16:18.274]  You know the secrets of the New World Order.
[00:16:18.274 --> 00:16:19.374]  You know who they are.
[00:16:19.374 --> 00:16:21.395]  Nothing can stop us!
[00:16:21.395 --> 00:16:22.555]  Resistance is victory!
[00:16:24.588 --> 00:16:32.431]  You understand that, you know that, you are unstoppable, nothing can stop you, and the minute you realize that, it's over for the globalist.
[00:16:32.431 --> 00:16:37.032]  So, we'll make this search term, bankers or us, and then let's throw a curveball at them.
[00:16:37.032 --> 00:16:38.353]  Let's do a long search term.
[00:16:38.353 --> 00:16:41.214]  Bankers or us is one, and let's do the whole headline.
[00:16:41.214 --> 00:16:42.594]  We'll make that number two.
[00:16:42.594 --> 00:16:44.075]  It's the bankers or us.
[00:16:44.075 --> 00:16:45.295]  It can be a long one.
[00:16:45.295 --> 00:16:49.157]  It's the bankers or us.
[00:16:49.157 --> 00:16:51.938]  It's the bankers or us, and bankers or us.
[00:16:53.863 --> 00:17:00.687]  And we'll see how the New World Order likes that.
[00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:06.631]  Now, continuing, because that article and that video breaks down the entire paradigm in 14 minutes.
[00:17:06.631 --> 00:17:09.873]  Now, this is what's come out now.
[00:17:09.873 --> 00:17:16.237]  You notice the Federal Reserve, they know the move to audit them next year is going to be nearly impossible to stop.
[00:17:16.237 --> 00:17:18.579]  They told Congress, we will never tell you where the money went.
[00:17:20.692 --> 00:17:22.593]  No Ron Paul, we won't tell you.
[00:17:22.593 --> 00:17:24.314]  No Bernie Sanders, we won't tell you.
[00:17:24.314 --> 00:17:26.355]  No Congressman Stern, we won't tell you.
[00:17:26.355 --> 00:17:28.636]  No Congressman Issa, we won't tell you.
[00:17:28.636 --> 00:17:30.517]  No, we will not tell you.
[00:17:30.517 --> 00:17:31.478]  No, no, no.
[00:17:31.478 --> 00:17:37.561]  And they go on their news hour, the former head of the Fed, and says, we're the fourth branch of government even though we're private.
[00:17:37.561 --> 00:17:39.362]  No one can audit us.
[00:17:39.362 --> 00:17:45.966]  But they know time's running out, so preemptively they come out and they say, okay, we gave hundreds of billions to Europe.
[00:17:45.966 --> 00:17:47.307]  We gave money to MSNBC.
[00:17:48.393 --> 00:17:51.535]  We gave money to almost every major Fortune 100.
[00:17:51.535 --> 00:17:58.860]  Gave them money, your tax money, to be part of this criminal operation.
[00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:02.662]  I mean, this is like Caesars buying off the Senate.
[00:18:02.662 --> 00:18:04.283]  And you notice it's bipartisan.
[00:18:04.283 --> 00:18:08.085]  The neocons are going crazy with this on talk radio, going, look at Obama.
[00:18:08.085 --> 00:18:14.730]  Obama is a teleprompter reader who works out twice a day and takes naps and watches SportsCenter.
[00:18:15.683 --> 00:18:18.984]  And then he goes out and gives four or five speeches a day.
[00:18:18.984 --> 00:18:23.606]  Obama isn't running Jack Diddley squat.
[00:18:23.606 --> 00:18:25.587]  Sure, he's a dangerous figurehead.
[00:18:25.587 --> 00:18:29.829]  Sure, he was probably born in Africa, gave up his citizenship in Indonesia.
[00:18:29.829 --> 00:18:32.830]  He's unsavory, I don't like him.
[00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:33.890]  But so what?
[00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:40.453]  They want you to get so caught up in hating him, just like so caught up in hating George W. Bush.
[00:18:40.453 --> 00:18:42.894]  George W. Bush was a virtual puppet.
[00:18:44.525 --> 00:18:46.727]  An absolute puppet.
[00:18:46.727 --> 00:18:49.809]  Lesser so than, I mean, he was about 95% puppet.
[00:18:49.809 --> 00:18:52.631]  Obama's about 99% puppet.
[00:18:52.631 --> 00:18:58.816]  Bill Clinton was about 60% puppet.
[00:18:58.816 --> 00:19:09.344]  I mean, he was evil, a globalist, an absolute collectivist, former CIA, same as his wife, we even know who his handler was when they were in England, that's been declassified.
[00:19:09.344 --> 00:19:10.465]  Absolutely horrible, but
[00:19:11.946 --> 00:19:14.167]  He was in there running things to a certain extent.
[00:19:14.167 --> 00:19:16.148]  So was Nixon.
[00:19:16.148 --> 00:19:21.570]  Until he got too big for his britches and they flushed him down the toilet, as you know, and that's now come out.
[00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:23.671]  Remember 10 years ago talking about how they set him up?
[00:19:23.671 --> 00:19:25.251]  Now that's mainstream news.
[00:19:25.251 --> 00:19:37.736]  You know, the issue here is that George Herbert Walker Bush was president from the time they shot Reagan when he was vice president and in that one term.
[00:19:37.736 --> 00:19:40.097]  So he was basically president for
[00:19:41.636 --> 00:19:43.557]  Two and a half terms or so or more.
[00:19:43.557 --> 00:19:46.278]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, into the banking.
[00:19:46.278 --> 00:19:49.499]  MSNBC is 110% discredited.
[00:19:49.499 --> 00:19:54.501]  It is a complete, absolute, federal government mouthpiece, 100%.
[00:19:54.501 --> 00:19:59.984]  And it's now certified and completely confirmed, and they run off of your tax money.
[00:20:00.939 --> 00:20:05.600]  We all know that Berkey Water Purification Systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:21:18.331 --> 00:21:27.121]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them until now, your cash would have the buying power of only $4,800.
[00:21:27.121 --> 00:21:30.624]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.

[00:22:00.091 --> 00:22:02.472]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:22:02.472 --> 00:22:04.673]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:22:04.673 --> 00:22:07.995]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:22:07.995 --> 00:22:13.098]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:22:13.098 --> 00:22:17.300]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.962]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:22:19.962 --> 00:22:22.843]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:22:22.843 --> 00:22:25.765]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:22:25.765 --> 00:22:33.370]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:22:33.706 --> 00:22:39.091]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:22:39.091 --> 00:22:41.933]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:22:41.933 --> 00:22:45.637]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:22:45.637 --> 00:22:46.698]  And I got news for you.
[00:22:46.698 --> 00:22:48.039]  You're everyone else.
[00:22:48.039 --> 00:22:49.540]  Invisible Empire.

[00:23:55.252 --> 00:24:03.977]  Season's greetings and health and wellness from Excalibur Dehydrator.
[00:24:03.977 --> 00:24:15.862]  Day after day, alone on a hill, the man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still.
[00:24:17.643 --> 00:24:24.508]  We've got a jam-packed broadcast today.
[00:24:45.589 --> 00:24:58.483]  With Max Keiser, with Michael Braverman, with Joe C. Hewson, coming on to talk about TSA, FOIA request, are they spying on the media, criticizing TSA?
[00:24:59.727 --> 00:25:03.511]  Well, we know they're threatening people with $11,000 fines that don't let them grab their genitals.
[00:25:03.511 --> 00:25:05.132]  So it's all about intimidation.
[00:25:05.132 --> 00:25:10.338]  The TSA told Atlantic Monthly, they squeeze your genitals to make you submit to the naked body scanner.
[00:25:10.338 --> 00:25:12.600]  This is the Homeland Gestapo.
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.181]  This is the Brownshirts.
[00:25:14.181 --> 00:25:18.566]  This is the federal takeover of all society and internal checkpoints.
[00:25:18.566 --> 00:25:20.287]  And they know that's what it is.
[00:25:20.908 --> 00:25:38.097]  For over seven years, I've told you what TSA would do because I saw Governor Ridge on C-SPAN say they're going to be at checkpoints everywhere, shopping malls, bus terminals, and you're going to have a national ID card approved by them to work or travel.
[00:25:38.097 --> 00:25:41.679]  You want to live in hardcore Joe Stalin America?
[00:25:41.679 --> 00:25:44.280]  You are, unless you say no to these people.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.641]  An army of brown shirts.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:51.003]  And I want to be clear, the average TSA is compartmentalized just like the public.
[00:25:51.003 --> 00:25:54.446]  They really think they're keeping you safe from Al-Cieda.
[00:25:54.446 --> 00:25:56.128]  All right, continuing here.
[00:25:56.128 --> 00:25:58.009]  This is such a big deal.
[00:25:58.009 --> 00:26:14.483]  This is such a big deal that they've released this information, and it's hundreds and hundreds of billions, over 200 billion to Europe, over 100 billion to Asia, close to 100 billion to Latin America, hundreds and hundreds of billions, and they're still not being absolutely specific.
[00:26:15.183 --> 00:26:16.504]  But here's the Washington Post.
[00:26:16.504 --> 00:26:19.426]  And notice they just bring this out like it's no big deal.
[00:26:19.426 --> 00:26:21.428]  Oh, the private Federal Reserve took your tax money.
[00:26:35.737 --> 00:26:39.119]  We gotta pay for all this, and gave it to select corporations.
[00:26:39.119 --> 00:26:44.061]  How are we supposed to compete against MSNBC being given hundreds of millions of federal money?
[00:26:44.061 --> 00:26:50.644]  How are you supposed to compete when big agribusiness writes the Food Safety Act to shut down local farms and ranches?
[00:26:50.644 --> 00:27:04.670]  How are we supposed to compete when now hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of firms every week are being given waivers from having to get the insurance, but McDonald's doesn't have to have the insurance, but your little hamburger place, Dan's Hamburgers, here in Austin, Texas,
[00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:20.294]  That's got hamburgers the same price as McDonald's with Angus beef, family-owned, totally delicious, no preservatives in it, a million times better, costs the same as McDonald's.
[00:27:20.294 --> 00:27:27.457]  How are they going to compete when they got to buy insurance for all their employees with entry-level jobs but McDonald's doesn't?
[00:27:27.457 --> 00:27:28.257]  Are you getting
[00:27:29.827 --> 00:27:36.731]  This, big mega corporations create big government to rob you at the barrel of a gun.
[00:27:36.731 --> 00:27:43.096]  If you don't pay all these income taxes they're raising, and all these other state and local taxes, they will send men to take your house.
[00:27:43.096 --> 00:27:47.739]  And if you resist, they'll call a paramilitary SWAT team and they will come to your house and they will murder you!
[00:27:48.786 --> 00:27:50.807]  This is not land of the free, home of the brave.
[00:27:50.807 --> 00:27:54.469]  This is a whorehouse run by foreign governments.
[00:27:54.469 --> 00:27:55.549]  People need to grow up.
[00:27:55.549 --> 00:28:01.832]  I hear these ninnying neocon talk show hosts and liberals and they're all ninnying and oh the government cares about us.
[00:28:01.832 --> 00:28:06.334]  The government shoots Guatemalan children up with syphilis to murder them.
[00:28:06.334 --> 00:28:15.358]  The government this year is flying around the world injecting and giving children polio that's live and murdering them and maiming them.
[00:28:15.358 --> 00:28:15.998]  The government
[00:28:16.178 --> 00:28:23.140]  Puts uranium in your drinking water and it comes out mainstream news and you're so brain damaged you don't do anything about it.
[00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:26.241]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:28:26.241 --> 00:28:35.723]  We've gotten to the point now with these psychological warfare experts that they are out in the open.
[00:28:35.723 --> 00:28:42.265]  Telling you that they give hundreds of billions of your tax money to private select corporations.
[00:28:47.611 --> 00:28:49.212]  Free money, in many of the cases.
[00:28:49.212 --> 00:28:53.555]  In other cases, at 0% interest.
[00:28:53.555 --> 00:28:58.198]  Continuing.
[00:28:58.198 --> 00:29:05.462]  They didn't just give the money to Wall Street, but also to motorcycle makers, telecom firms, and foreign-owned banks in 2008 and 2009.
[00:29:05.462 --> 00:29:07.444]  Bipartisan.
[00:29:07.444 --> 00:29:10.225]  The Fed's effort to prop up the financial sector.
[00:29:10.225 --> 00:29:10.566]  Oh, yeah.
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:14.161]  Reached across a broad spectrum of the economy.
[00:29:14.161 --> 00:29:16.702]  Benefiting stalwarts of American industry.
[00:29:16.702 --> 00:29:17.243]  Stalwarts?
[00:29:17.243 --> 00:29:19.384]  General Electric's almost completely foreign.
[00:29:19.384 --> 00:29:21.145]  They've got more going on in China than they do here.
[00:29:21.145 --> 00:29:22.245]  By the way, that's in the news today.
[00:29:22.245 --> 00:29:25.827]  Bank of America will soon be majority China.
[00:29:25.827 --> 00:29:31.350]  And Caterpillar and household name companies such as Verizon, Harley-Davidson, who just moved to India.
[00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:32.250]  None of these people!
[00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:33.431]  And Toyota.
[00:29:33.431 --> 00:29:36.292]  The central bank's aid programs also supported U.S.
[00:29:36.292 --> 00:29:37.853]  subsidiary banks in East Asia.
[00:29:38.673 --> 00:29:42.798]  Europe and Canada while rescuing money market mutual funds held by millions of Americans.
[00:29:42.798 --> 00:29:43.939]  Yeah, you rescued them.
[00:29:43.939 --> 00:29:50.626]  They came out and terrorized and said we were going into a depression October 2nd to drive it down.
[00:29:50.626 --> 00:29:52.027]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.027 --> 00:29:54.550]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:57.233]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.247 --> 00:30:04.811]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:04.811 --> 00:30:05.711]  Number 1.
[00:30:05.711 --> 00:30:09.154]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:09.154 --> 00:30:10.015]  Number 2.
[00:30:10.015 --> 00:30:14.898]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:14.898 --> 00:30:15.639]  It's true.
[00:30:15.639 --> 00:30:20.523]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.523 --> 00:30:21.343]  Number 3.
[00:30:21.343 --> 00:30:24.926]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:24.926 --> 00:30:28.609]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:28.829 --> 00:30:29.630]  Number 4.
[00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:32.393]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:32.393 --> 00:30:36.077]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:36.077 --> 00:30:36.857]  Number 5.
[00:30:36.857 --> 00:30:41.002]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:41.002 --> 00:30:45.767]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:46.047 --> 00:30:50.230]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:52.012]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:52.012 --> 00:30:54.254]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:30:54.254 --> 00:30:56.595]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:31:01.423 --> 00:31:05.427]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:31:05.427 --> 00:31:08.691]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:31:08.691 --> 00:31:13.476]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:31:13.476 --> 00:31:19.862]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:31:19.862 --> 00:31:22.125]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:31:22.645 --> 00:31:22.945]  Tim Geithner?
[00:31:22.945 --> 00:31:23.466]  Bernanke?
[00:31:23.466 --> 00:31:24.126]  They're arsonists!
[00:31:24.126 --> 00:31:25.407]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:31:25.407 --> 00:31:27.648]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:31:41.556 --> 00:31:45.918]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:31:45.918 --> 00:31:48.819]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:31:48.819 --> 00:31:57.943]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:32:01.872 --> 00:32:05.833]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:05.833 --> 00:32:14.694]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:32:14.694 --> 00:32:19.315]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:32:19.315 --> 00:32:30.137]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:32:30.777 --> 00:32:40.280]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:45.722]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:32:45.722 --> 00:32:53.205]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:53.205 --> 00:32:55.966]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:07.972]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:33:07.972 --> 00:33:09.496]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:33:31.721 --> 00:33:33.182]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:33:33.182 --> 00:33:37.303]  We're now 33 minutes into the first hour of this worldwide transmission.
[00:33:37.303 --> 00:33:41.145]  This part of the song's too good.
[00:33:41.145 --> 00:33:42.626]  Crank it up for me.
[00:33:42.626 --> 00:33:48.028]  So when you're waiting for the next attack, you better stand, there's no turning back.
[00:33:48.028 --> 00:33:51.270]  The fewer sounds, the chance begins.
[00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:53.931]  But on this battlefield, no one wins.
[00:33:53.931 --> 00:33:56.812]  The smell of ice and smoke and heartless breath.
[00:34:01.508 --> 00:34:19.232]  We've got coming up the CEO and head of Bob Barr's group who is investigating the criminal stand-down of the TSA and their reported spying on their main media detractors Matt Drudge and yours truly Alex Jones.
[00:34:19.232 --> 00:34:24.534]  We've also got Max Keiser coming on and Michael Braverman.
[00:34:24.534 --> 00:34:25.734]  I talked to Michael yesterday
[00:34:27.074 --> 00:34:30.275]  And I'd already scheduled him a few weeks ago to come on and talk about water.
[00:34:30.275 --> 00:34:35.537]  We had Ventura on, of course, the week before, covering the JFK special.
[00:34:35.537 --> 00:34:43.419]  And he just told me about the full production, because I'd consulted on it and been interviewed for it, coming up tomorrow.
[00:34:43.419 --> 00:34:50.281]  But it was so busy, I hadn't really paid attention to the full breakdown of the rest of the show while they were still investigating.
[00:34:50.281 --> 00:34:53.502]  And they simultaneously discovered the uranium in the water.
[00:34:55.109 --> 00:34:55.570]  I don't
[00:35:08.496 --> 00:35:21.219]  News headline in Texas of Texas with the federal government suppressed for decades high levels of uranium and other radioactive isotopes like radium in the water.
[00:35:21.219 --> 00:35:27.380]  But what they don't tell you is that's from the fluoride that they mine out of the phosphate limestone.
[00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:30.601]  That's the same place they mine for uranium.
[00:35:30.601 --> 00:35:33.321]  That's where uranium deposits are.
[00:35:33.321 --> 00:35:34.621]  Just search the term.
[00:35:34.621 --> 00:35:36.742]  Where do you find uranium deposits?
[00:35:37.122 --> 00:35:42.544]  And you'll get all the university geology sites saying limestone deposits.
[00:35:42.544 --> 00:35:47.226]  It'll tell you the same place they mine for phosphates is where you find this.
[00:35:47.226 --> 00:35:53.708]  It's in Florida and Colorado are some of the areas where you find the most uranium.
[00:35:53.708 --> 00:35:56.089]  Then you find out about companies that mine uranium.
[00:35:56.089 --> 00:36:02.691]  It's the same companies that mine for the fluoride.
[00:36:02.691 --> 00:36:04.852]  But the public has like a defense mechanism
[00:36:06.018 --> 00:36:08.121]  Where they can't hear this information.
[00:36:08.121 --> 00:36:10.705]  It's too scary.
[00:36:10.705 --> 00:36:12.207]  So it's just shut up.
[00:36:12.207 --> 00:36:13.850]  There's no uranium in my water.
[00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:17.595]  Well, we're going to be talking about that coming up with some other big breaking news with Michael Braverman.
[00:36:17.595 --> 00:36:21.441]  I'm going to continue next hour getting into
[00:36:22.674 --> 00:36:25.635]  Fed aid in financial crisis went beyond U.S.
[00:36:25.635 --> 00:36:28.557]  banks to industry and foreign firms.
[00:36:28.557 --> 00:36:30.098]  And they just kind of hide it in plain view.
[00:36:30.098 --> 00:36:33.519]  Oh, most of the big media is government-funded.
[00:36:33.519 --> 00:36:37.381]  The media has already gotten its, quote, bailout or its payoff.
[00:36:37.381 --> 00:36:45.525]  Meanwhile, the FCC and the rest of them are coming in saying they want to censor the Internet and alternative media and talk radio.
[00:36:45.525 --> 00:36:48.707]  When you read these articles, talk radio didn't get any government money.
[00:36:50.831 --> 00:37:03.560]  This is not a free country taking my tax money at gun barrel to give it to Chris Matthews to go up there and try to claim I'm a racist because I don't want government health care.
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:11.306]  Think of how sick that is and how they've hidden all this classic corruption.
[00:37:11.306 --> 00:37:13.368]  I've got another big announcement coming up.
[00:37:14.218 --> 00:37:14.458]  Okay.
[00:37:14.458 --> 00:37:15.939]  I want to play this video.
[00:37:15.939 --> 00:37:16.839]  And it is the search term today.
[00:37:40.854 --> 00:37:42.736]  It's the bankers or us.
[00:37:42.736 --> 00:37:44.157]  Put in that full short sentence.
[00:37:44.157 --> 00:37:45.658]  It's the bankers or us.
[00:37:45.658 --> 00:37:47.059]  Or you can just put in bankers or us.
[00:37:47.059 --> 00:37:49.221]  We can get both search terms up there at the top.
[00:37:49.221 --> 00:37:52.303]  And it's a little 14 minute video we put together.
[00:37:52.303 --> 00:37:55.766]  We're gonna go ahead and roll that now.
[00:37:55.766 --> 00:37:57.727]  And then I'm gonna come back and continue to break it down.
[00:37:57.727 --> 00:37:58.088]  Stay with us.
[00:38:07.864 --> 00:38:16.972]  My friends, it doesn't matter if you're in the United States, England, Germany, Japan, areas of Africa, South America, it doesn't matter.
[00:38:16.972 --> 00:38:20.135]  We are all in the same boat together.
[00:38:21.547 --> 00:38:27.528]  The private banking cartel, six major super banks, have created Ponzi schemes.
[00:38:27.528 --> 00:38:42.152]  They have sold over 1.5 quadrillion, that's $1,500 trillion of fraudulent derivatives, counterfeit instruments, financial instruments of fraud.
[00:38:44.039 --> 00:38:47.062]  The IMF and World Bank are their international holding companies.
[00:38:47.062 --> 00:38:50.686]  Regionally, we have the Private Central Bank of the US, the Federal Reserve.
[00:38:50.686 --> 00:38:53.048]  The Bank of England, over in England.
[00:38:53.048 --> 00:38:56.391]  We have the Private Central Bank in Ireland.
[00:38:56.391 --> 00:39:01.737]  It's the same everywhere, except for a few, quote, rogue nations that aren't controlled by this cartel.
[00:39:01.737 --> 00:39:05.721]  And those are countries being menaced by the globalist military.
[00:39:07.625 --> 00:39:10.770]  They are engineering the total collapse of society.
[00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:16.039]  I've been talking about this for 11 years since they got rid of the Glass-Steagall Act here in the U.S.
[00:39:16.039 --> 00:39:22.128]  and simultaneously in other nations got laws passed so they could do this and get away with it.
[00:39:23.177 --> 00:39:32.599]  On the way up, with the thousands of trillions that they manufactured out of nothing, they bought up the entire infrastructure, the media, the defense contractors, everything.
[00:39:32.599 --> 00:39:39.860]  On the way down, they hold populations hostage and say, give us trillions more, or we will implode the economy.
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:51.502]  That's what happened over two years ago in October of 2008, when Henry Paulson, the Secretary of the Treasury, went and told the House and Senate, there'll be martial law, blood in the streets, total collapse, if you don't do what we want.
[00:39:52.262 --> 00:39:54.123]  Here we are two years later.
[00:39:54.123 --> 00:39:55.923]  Europe gave in.
[00:39:55.923 --> 00:39:57.424]  Japan gave in.
[00:39:57.424 --> 00:39:58.984]  The United States gave in.
[00:39:58.984 --> 00:40:06.647]  And now you see Ireland, you see Greece, you see Portugal, Spain, Germany on the edge of collapse.
[00:40:06.647 --> 00:40:08.128]  And what do the central bankers say?
[00:40:08.128 --> 00:40:11.929]  Give us trillions more, raise your taxes in your countries,
[00:40:13.106 --> 00:40:18.650]  Cut benefits and pay almost everything that you raise in taxes to us.
[00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:21.332]  But it's mathematically impossible.
[00:40:21.332 --> 00:40:22.453]  Listen to me.
[00:40:22.453 --> 00:40:25.055]  I've interviewed literally hundreds of top economists on this.
[00:40:25.055 --> 00:40:27.116]  This is a fact.
[00:40:27.116 --> 00:40:34.221]  It is mathematically impossible to ever pay back the 1.5 quadrillion.
[00:40:34.221 --> 00:40:36.183]  That's a conservative number.
[00:40:36.183 --> 00:40:37.884]  They know that.
[00:40:37.884 --> 00:40:40.146]  And so, look at Ireland.
[00:40:41.283 --> 00:40:45.407]  Just a few months ago, they entered the EU.
[00:40:45.407 --> 00:40:48.009]  They were told, oh, you're a great economy, it's so wonderful.
[00:40:48.009 --> 00:40:52.292]  But under the EU agreement, they're now under the control of those private banks.
[00:40:52.292 --> 00:40:54.734]  And suddenly, oh my gosh, your economy's over.
[00:40:54.734 --> 00:41:00.800]  You've got to pay 20% of your GDP on top of what you're already paying to offshore banks.
[00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:07.503]  The head of their private central bank told the BBC that we want foreign banks to own Ireland.
[00:41:07.503 --> 00:41:08.744]  This is a good thing.
[00:41:08.744 --> 00:41:10.865]  Irish banks are up for sale.
[00:41:10.865 --> 00:41:14.967]  We're going to cut your pension funds that the government forced you to pay in for decades.
[00:41:14.967 --> 00:41:17.468]  We're going to cut the veterans care.
[00:41:17.468 --> 00:41:21.891]  We're going to again slash road repairs.
[00:41:21.891 --> 00:41:22.611]  You name it.
[00:41:22.611 --> 00:41:24.272]  But the taxes go up.
[00:41:24.272 --> 00:41:26.373]  Everything goes to the private bankers.
[00:41:26.373 --> 00:41:27.974]  That's austerity.
[00:41:27.974 --> 00:41:29.395]  They cut the budget.
[00:41:30.233 --> 00:41:31.773]  For the population.
[00:41:31.773 --> 00:41:34.034]  See, first they get you dependent on government.
[00:41:34.034 --> 00:41:34.834]  This is their system.
[00:41:34.834 --> 00:41:36.114]  They grow government.
[00:41:36.114 --> 00:41:38.555]  And this has happened all over the world over and over again.
[00:41:38.555 --> 00:41:40.656]  The globalists are done gobbling up third world countries.
[00:41:40.656 --> 00:41:42.856]  They're moving on to Europe and the United States now.
[00:41:42.856 --> 00:41:43.616]  No one is safe.
[00:41:43.616 --> 00:41:45.317]  Australia, Canada, you name it.
[00:41:45.317 --> 00:41:47.477]  The same system is taking place.
[00:41:47.477 --> 00:41:51.878]  That's how we knew what they would do in the West because we'd seen them do it in the third world.
[00:41:51.878 --> 00:41:54.519]  We saw the economic hitmen setting up the same system.
[00:41:54.519 --> 00:41:57.980]  This is such important information and I hope you're listening to me.
[00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:06.122]  There is no light at the end of the tunnel unless we do not pay these bankers all of this fraudulent debt they've manufactured.
[00:42:06.122 --> 00:42:20.546]  If we don't throw these private central banks out of our countries, if we don't return sound monetary policy controlled by our Congress and Parliaments, this is designed to implode economies and transfer all wealth to them.
[00:42:20.546 --> 00:42:21.746]  That's why, whether it's Europe,
[00:42:22.594 --> 00:42:30.398]  Or the United States, or any other country or region they control, the central banks and the private banks are making record profits in the trillions.
[00:42:30.398 --> 00:42:33.999]  Billions in individual bonuses, in many cases.
[00:42:33.999 --> 00:42:36.581]  They know what they're doing.
[00:42:36.581 --> 00:42:39.062]  This is a consolidation of power and control.
[00:42:39.062 --> 00:42:40.843]  They're slashing police locally.
[00:42:40.843 --> 00:42:42.824]  They're slashing basic services.
[00:42:42.824 --> 00:42:46.305]  But the taxes go up because everything is going to them.
[00:42:46.305 --> 00:42:50.067]  Now remember, the United States is about a year behind Europe.
[00:42:51.770 --> 00:43:01.957]  And in Europe, in the last year, they have been slashing police, cutting roads, raising, literally, in some countries, hundreds of new taxes per nation.
[00:43:01.957 --> 00:43:03.818]  They have been squeezing the population.
[00:43:03.818 --> 00:43:08.081]  They have been turning paramilitary tax collectors loose on people.
[00:43:08.081 --> 00:43:10.363]  They've been getting rid of all the tax exemptions.
[00:43:10.363 --> 00:43:18.888]  They are squeezing and squeezing and squeezing, like the Sheriff of Nottingham from the fables of England,
[00:43:20.049 --> 00:43:24.871]  Hundreds and hundreds of years ago with Robin Hood and his merry men.
[00:43:24.871 --> 00:43:28.233]  This is actually happening to us.
[00:43:28.233 --> 00:43:31.435]  And so the media is spinning this in Europe and here in the U.S.
[00:43:31.435 --> 00:43:34.256]  saying, oh, look at good conservative politicians.
[00:43:34.256 --> 00:43:37.197]  They are slashing infrastructure spending.
[00:43:37.197 --> 00:43:38.638]  They're slashing pensions.
[00:43:38.638 --> 00:43:40.879]  They're slashing veterans benefits.
[00:43:40.879 --> 00:43:41.800]  Aren't they great?
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:43.541]  They'll get us out of this problem.
[00:43:43.541 --> 00:43:45.802]  That's a tiny piece.
[00:43:45.802 --> 00:43:46.662]  The whole U.S.
[00:43:46.662 --> 00:43:48.043]  debt is $14 trillion.
[00:43:48.743 --> 00:43:57.727]  Here's 1.5 quadrillion worldwide, and even the Washington Post estimates the US's share of that is 600 trillion.
[00:43:57.727 --> 00:43:59.468]  It's impossible!
[00:43:59.468 --> 00:44:08.213]  They could devalue the money like this was Zimbabwe or Weimar Republic Germany in the 1920s and 30s, and it's impossible.
[00:44:08.213 --> 00:44:10.133]  Do you understand?
[00:44:10.133 --> 00:44:13.395]  All the solutions they give you are only to consolidate power.
[00:44:13.395 --> 00:44:14.776]  It's economic warfare.
[00:44:15.666 --> 00:44:18.248]  So Europe, on average, is about a year ahead of us.
[00:44:18.248 --> 00:44:21.730]  And you watch, as we told you in my film, Obama Deception, a year and a half ago.
[00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:26.072]  It would start in Greece, and then Ireland, and then Portugal, and then Spain.
[00:44:26.072 --> 00:44:28.994]  That's what the economist we interviewed said would happen.
[00:44:28.994 --> 00:44:31.615]  It would then move to England, and Germany, and France.
[00:44:31.615 --> 00:44:32.496]  Now it is.
[00:44:32.496 --> 00:44:34.157]  It would then travel to the United States.
[00:44:35.762 --> 00:44:37.103]  This is all engineered.
[00:44:37.103 --> 00:44:39.384]  I cannot stress that enough to you.
[00:44:39.384 --> 00:44:53.352]  And that they would cut veterans' benefits, that they'd signed on and were guaranteed basic health care, that they would federalize your private pensions and tax them and reduce them in the name of saving them, because the pensions are invested in the derivatives fraud.
[00:44:53.352 --> 00:44:54.072]  That's the trap.
[00:44:54.072 --> 00:44:55.413]  They hold you hostage.
[00:44:55.413 --> 00:44:56.494]  They get you to invest.
[00:44:57.814 --> 00:45:03.600]  In their derivatives, your county, your city, your police pension, your federal pension.
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.101]  And then that money's not there.
[00:45:05.101 --> 00:45:08.124]  Oh, if you want to get that pension, you've got to bail out the banks.
[00:45:08.124 --> 00:45:09.005]  But it's not a bailout.
[00:45:09.005 --> 00:45:10.667]  They set this up.
[00:45:10.667 --> 00:45:12.128]  And so now it's here.
[00:45:12.128 --> 00:45:15.772]  Just this week, White House official Obama to freeze pay a federal workers.
[00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:20.566]  Notice all the news in the last week about how, oh, he doubled the amount of federal workers getting $150,000.
[00:45:20.566 --> 00:45:24.372]  Oh, about how great they're having it.
[00:45:24.372 --> 00:45:27.436]  That's to sell them as the main scapegoat.
[00:45:27.436 --> 00:45:28.879]  I'm not against cutting their pay.
[00:45:28.879 --> 00:45:30.040]  I'm not against freezing their pay.
[00:45:30.865 --> 00:45:33.887]  But you do it after you've arrested the central bank heads.
[00:45:33.887 --> 00:45:38.411]  You do it after you've written off the 1.5 quadrillion that's impossible to pay off.
[00:45:38.411 --> 00:45:42.534]  You do it after you brought a true monetary system into existence.
[00:45:42.534 --> 00:45:48.179]  But you wouldn't have to do that with all these cuts if you got rid of this corrupt fractional reserve banking system.
[00:45:48.179 --> 00:45:50.761]  I do want to cut government because it's used as an agent of tyranny.
[00:45:51.201 --> 00:45:59.089]  It was put in place and grown to suppress us during this implosion phase, during this shearing phase, the shearing of the sheep.
[00:45:59.089 --> 00:46:04.876]  So now they've announced that they're going to freeze the pay of federal workers for two years and then probably cut it.
[00:46:04.876 --> 00:46:12.323]  Bloomberg, of course, has reported over a year ago that pension funds are being ordered, private pension funds, to quote, invest in failed megabanks.
[00:46:13.004 --> 00:46:17.307]  There's no law, but federal regulators come like the mafia and say you better do it.
[00:46:17.307 --> 00:46:30.595]  It's come out in the last few months, also in AP and Bloomberg, that 11 years ago a secret deal was signed by Prudential and other major insurance companies with the VA to allow them to steal all of the death benefits that troops pay out of their check.
[00:46:31.175 --> 00:46:35.817]  For if they die in battle or after they die, so their widow or widower gets the money.
[00:46:35.817 --> 00:46:37.257]  That was all just stolen.
[00:46:37.257 --> 00:46:42.359]  This is the greatest swindle and the most brazen I've ever seen studying history.
[00:46:42.359 --> 00:46:52.722]  It is so off the charts, because the average American only cares about sports or rioting and looting, you know, during Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, to get their little slave goods.
[00:46:52.722 --> 00:46:53.663]  Now this is key.
[00:46:53.663 --> 00:46:57.064]  Remember the article from March 21st, 2009 in Stars and Stripes, over a year ago.
[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:11.966]  And in it, Obama proposed that they make all military people buy their own insurance for combat-related injuries.
[00:47:11.966 --> 00:47:17.468]  They've signed a contract guaranteed if they get their arms and legs blown off, Uncle Sam, the taxpayer, is going to pay for it.
[00:47:17.468 --> 00:47:24.352]  Veterans of Foreign Wars, veterans organization, went wild, got angry, said no to this plan, and Obama backed off for a year.
[00:47:25.032 --> 00:47:29.454]  Now they're back, and in the New York Times, pitching it to you like it's a great thing.
[00:47:29.454 --> 00:47:35.056]  And they're announcing, hey, there's 2 million people that are on government-paid-for insurance because they're veterans.
[00:47:35.056 --> 00:47:36.977]  The government wants to take that away.
[00:47:36.977 --> 00:47:40.978]  Take the health care completely away from the veterans.
[00:47:40.978 --> 00:47:41.599]  It continues.
[00:47:41.599 --> 00:47:43.179]  Here's the Wall Street Journal.
[00:47:43.179 --> 00:47:45.820]  Union drops health coverage for workers.
[00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:46.461]  It's a union.
[00:47:47.461 --> 00:47:52.083]  In New York, and they're dropping coverage for the children of the workers.
[00:47:52.083 --> 00:47:53.724]  This is austerity.
[00:47:53.724 --> 00:47:58.346]  You pay into these pensions, you pay into these unions, you go and join the military.
[00:47:58.346 --> 00:48:02.387]  You do everything, and they're even cutting it from those groups.
[00:48:02.387 --> 00:48:05.428]  If they'll go after the veterans, they'll go after anybody.
[00:48:05.428 --> 00:48:13.572]  Under austerity, that's been done in hundreds of countries, over and over again, in just the last 20 years, we know what the private central banks are going to do.
[00:48:14.594 --> 00:48:22.398]  And once the country fully is bankrupt, whether you're Ireland or the US, it doesn't matter, it's the same formula, they are going to shut everything down.
[00:48:22.398 --> 00:48:27.621]  And once the economy fully disintegrates, they're going to triple water, triple power prices.
[00:48:27.621 --> 00:48:31.583]  They're going to force the government to hand all these infrastructures over to them.
[00:48:31.583 --> 00:48:35.025]  They are going to completely sell out the nation even further.
[00:48:35.025 --> 00:48:40.348]  You think the Communist Chinese are on the Panama Canal and most of our former military ports on our east and west coast?
[00:48:40.348 --> 00:48:41.308]  You think that's bad?
[00:48:41.308 --> 00:48:42.489]  You think the Arabs
[00:48:43.527 --> 00:48:45.409]  You know, owning so much of our infrastructure is bad?
[00:48:45.409 --> 00:48:50.836]  You think foreign banks, you know, coming in here with a fire cell, buying up our companies is bad and our highways?
[00:48:50.836 --> 00:48:52.397]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:48:52.397 --> 00:48:54.900]  Austerity is total enslavement.
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:57.163]  Economic bondage for you and your family.
[00:48:57.163 --> 00:48:58.565]  And it's all a fraud!
[00:48:59.946 --> 00:49:01.687]  The mega-banks engineer it.
[00:49:01.687 --> 00:49:04.548]  They get tens of trillions of dollars of tax money.
[00:49:04.548 --> 00:49:10.211]  They implode the economy and demand even more because we're held hostage by them.
[00:49:10.211 --> 00:49:11.832]  And it's not even a solution.
[00:49:11.832 --> 00:49:13.752]  It's only going to get worse.
[00:49:13.752 --> 00:49:16.214]  It is a distraction to cut the veterans' health care.
[00:49:16.214 --> 00:49:19.075]  It is a distraction to steal people's pension funds.
[00:49:19.075 --> 00:49:20.676]  It is pure robbery.
[00:49:20.676 --> 00:49:22.437]  We must kick this system out.
[00:49:22.437 --> 00:49:26.318]  We must bring these bankers to justice and write off this fraudulent debt.
[00:49:26.318 --> 00:49:27.339]  We do not owe it.
[00:49:27.799 --> 00:49:38.845]  But the banks in the last hundred years in the West have openly fostered this system of getting us into debt so they could profit on the fiat loans they make up out of nothing.
[00:49:38.845 --> 00:49:43.007]  But we're now entering the endgame where they're fully imploding us by design.
[00:49:43.007 --> 00:49:44.508]  It's the bankers or us.
[00:49:44.508 --> 00:49:46.129]  We don't have a choice.
[00:49:46.929 --> 00:49:49.591]  You've got to tell everyone you know about this.
[00:49:49.591 --> 00:49:51.732]  You've got to inform them so they understand.
[00:49:51.732 --> 00:49:57.916]  You know, I mentioned these earlier, but again, here it is, BBC News, Irish Republic Banks, for sale.
[00:49:57.916 --> 00:50:08.943]  And they've got the head of their private central bank that runs the country, this fourth branch of government, Patrick Hoonahan, openly saying that the International Monetary Fund will now save Ireland.
[00:50:08.943 --> 00:50:10.004]  And how will they do that?
[00:50:10.004 --> 00:50:14.547]  By slashing pensions, by cutting police, by cheating veterans in their healthcare.
[00:50:14.907 --> 00:50:16.068]  It's the same laundry list.
[00:50:16.068 --> 00:50:17.589]  It always is.
[00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:26.954]  And he goes on to say, I've been an advocate for many years of the value for small countries to have foreign owners for their banks.
[00:50:26.954 --> 00:50:30.736]  Did you just hear me?
[00:50:30.736 --> 00:50:31.797]  This is treason.
[00:50:31.797 --> 00:50:33.678]  It's the same thing here.
[00:50:33.678 --> 00:50:40.482]  This is a global government, a private corporate global government, taking over every major society with the same formula.
[00:50:40.482 --> 00:50:41.303]  It is fraudulent.
[00:50:42.256 --> 00:50:44.977]  And it must be resisted or we have no future.
[00:50:44.977 --> 00:50:47.458]  We cannot allow this new dark age to begin.
[00:50:47.458 --> 00:50:48.979]  Alright, there's a few minutes left of it.
[00:50:48.979 --> 00:50:51.460]  You can watch the rest at InfoWars.com.

[00:52:05.843 --> 00:52:09.765]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:52:09.765 --> 00:52:12.006]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:52:12.006 --> 00:52:17.869]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:52:17.869 --> 00:52:24.112]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:52:24.532 --> 00:52:30.514]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.

[00:53:02.306 --> 00:53:05.228]  You must be scanned and searched before entering the mall area.
[00:53:05.228 --> 00:53:10.131]  Attention, you must disrobe and pass through the scanner at mall security before entering the building.
[00:53:10.131 --> 00:53:15.474]  Hey, most GCN listeners know that the future of Christmas shopping may quite well be that scary.
[00:53:15.474 --> 00:53:21.097]  And while we're not there yet, as shoppers we still face terrible traffic, crazy lines, and even crazier shoppers.
[00:53:21.297 --> 00:53:23.079]  But this year can be different.
[00:53:23.079 --> 00:53:34.269]  You can still opt out of the craziness and do your shopping off the grid by going to OffTheGridChristmas.com, where you'll find our new Christmas video featuring an amazing assortment of truly hard-to-get gifts.
[00:53:34.269 --> 00:53:36.791]  Gifts you simply won't find in stores.
[00:53:36.791 --> 00:53:40.995]  These are gifts that can help anyone on your list become better prepared for the hard times ahead.
[00:53:40.995 --> 00:53:42.456]  And here's the best part.
[00:53:42.456 --> 00:53:45.299]  Prices have been slashed until December 15th.
[00:53:45.299 --> 00:53:46.940]  This year, opt out of the lines.
[00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:47.801]  You won't get fined.
[00:53:47.961 --> 00:53:53.664]  You'll get great discounts on all kinds of Off The Grid gear by going to OffTheGridChristmas.com.
[00:53:53.664 --> 00:53:55.584]  Go to OffTheGridChristmas.com.
[00:53:55.584 --> 00:54:00.807]  That's OffTheGridChristmas.com.
[00:54:00.807 --> 00:54:01.647]  Perfluoroalkyl!
[00:54:16.013 --> 00:54:26.295]  I remember many years ago, not just reading about Bispinol A, when they approved this stuff decades ago, but perfluoroalkyls.
[00:54:26.295 --> 00:54:35.238]  And I hope I'm pronouncing that right, but it's the lining in the packaging that's wrapped around hamburgers and things to stop the grease.
[00:54:35.238 --> 00:54:36.758]  Why not just go with old-fashioned paper?
[00:54:37.659 --> 00:54:39.880]  And so what if some grease goes through it?
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:43.642]  And it turns out these attack fertility, cause cancer.
[00:54:43.642 --> 00:54:46.264]  Dr. Marcola's got the government's own reports on that.
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:51.161]  And Drudge is linking to this today.
[00:54:51.161 --> 00:54:54.162]  I tell you, Matt Drudge has come so far.
[00:54:54.162 --> 00:54:58.224]  He really obviously now knows about the world government, the New World Order.
[00:54:58.224 --> 00:55:03.627]  He covered Bilderberg the last two years in a row and forced it out of the mainstream news in the US.
[00:55:03.627 --> 00:55:06.808]  I'm not trying to grovel to Matt Drudge.
[00:55:06.808 --> 00:55:12.070]  It's just such a bellwether that he is going more and more hardcore every day.
[00:55:12.070 --> 00:55:14.492]  I mean, take this Washington Post article.
[00:55:14.492 --> 00:55:15.192]  Buried in it
[00:55:16.593 --> 00:55:26.418]  It admits that MSNBC got massive money out of the billions that General Electric, its parent company, got for fake government news.
[00:55:26.418 --> 00:55:31.181]  Well, Drudge takes that stuff that's buried and he makes that the headline.
[00:55:31.181 --> 00:55:33.142]  Fed secretly bailed out GE.
[00:55:33.142 --> 00:55:40.625]  GE news outlets failed to reveal in Fed coverage.
[00:55:40.625 --> 00:55:41.566]  That is exciting.
[00:55:42.955 --> 00:55:45.476]  And I've got all those reports here in front of me.
[00:55:45.476 --> 00:55:59.882]  You know, that's why we ask you to buy the books and videos and t-shirts and ball caps and bumper stickers and wristbands and pens and Infowars.com pocket knives and flashlights and water filters.
[00:55:59.882 --> 00:56:07.105]  All of them are great products you need, but also, this is how we fund the operation.
[00:56:07.105 --> 00:56:11.707]  You know, Benjamin Franklin had to go over to France and go out in the streets and sell American flags.
[00:56:12.979 --> 00:56:26.568]  And the fact that he was very famous, one of the most famous men in the world for being an inventor and a writer, people would buy the American flag from him for five, ten times what it was worth just so they could shake his hand.
[00:56:26.568 --> 00:56:27.729]  It's the same thing here.
[00:56:27.729 --> 00:56:29.249]  But I'm not Benjamin Franklin.
[00:56:29.249 --> 00:56:30.730]  I'm just little Alex Jones.
[00:56:30.730 --> 00:56:34.573]  And I'm like, look, these are powerful films I've made on DVD.
[00:56:34.573 --> 00:56:37.615]  This is PrisonPlanet.tv memberships, everything in one spot.
[00:56:40.131 --> 00:56:41.313]  You gotta support us.
[00:56:41.313 --> 00:56:46.499]  I mean, we're not supported by the Federal Reserve or George Soros.
[00:56:46.499 --> 00:56:47.661]  Like Fox News.
[00:56:47.661 --> 00:56:51.045]  Fox News is supported by the Federal Reserve, not by Soros.
[00:56:51.045 --> 00:56:54.089]  MSNBC is supported by both.
[00:56:54.089 --> 00:56:55.752]  I need your support, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:57.128 --> 00:57:03.593]  You know, we sell advertising on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com for about what a small town newspaper sells advertising.
[00:57:03.593 --> 00:57:06.094]  We're bigger than MSNBC.com.
[00:57:06.094 --> 00:57:09.337]  I looked up the rates for MSNBC.com for a banner on them.
[00:57:09.337 --> 00:57:11.758]  It's about $40,000 a month.
[00:57:11.758 --> 00:57:13.940]  For a banner with us, it's about $1,000.
[00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:16.702]  It's all hot air fraud!
[00:57:16.702 --> 00:57:18.243]  Okay?
[00:57:18.243 --> 00:57:23.226]  This radio show per hour is bigger than MSNBC, just with our AM and FM affiliates.
[00:57:23.226 --> 00:57:25.768]  They've only got a half million viewers on their biggest shows.
[00:57:25.768 --> 00:57:26.549]  They're a joke!
[00:57:28.339 --> 00:57:34.621]  But they charge $10,000, $20,000 per minute for an ad during prime time.
[00:57:34.621 --> 00:57:38.782]  Ads on this radio station, on this radio network are like $250.
[00:57:38.782 --> 00:57:42.023]  We can't expand and continue at that rate.
[00:57:42.023 --> 00:57:43.664]  We need people to donate.
[00:57:43.664 --> 00:57:48.145]  And you do it by buying the books, the videos, by joining PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:57:48.145 --> 00:57:50.526]  We're giving the globalists a run for their money.
[00:57:50.526 --> 00:57:56.288]  But we're not big, arrogant teleprompter readers that fool all the folks watching mainline TV.
[00:57:57.836 --> 00:58:03.180]  And when big megacorporations go advertise on those channels, they know it's worthless.
[00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:04.741]  They're funding the evil.
[00:58:04.741 --> 00:58:06.543]  They're funding their inside game.
[00:58:06.543 --> 00:58:16.791]  Because from behind the scenes, Toyota or GM advertise on MSNBC or CNN and then get government money with the other hand.
[00:58:16.791 --> 00:58:19.252]  They take your money and use it against you.
[00:58:19.252 --> 00:58:20.854]  We can't do that and wouldn't do that.
[00:58:21.618 --> 00:58:23.159]  We don't do that!
[00:58:23.159 --> 00:58:25.601]  So go to InfoWars.com and get tools to wake people up.
[00:58:25.601 --> 00:58:26.662]  The Obama Deception.
[00:58:26.662 --> 00:58:27.642]  Fall of the Republic.
[00:58:27.642 --> 00:58:28.583]  Invisible Empire.
[00:58:28.583 --> 00:58:29.764]  Powerful films.
[00:58:29.764 --> 00:58:30.364]  Endgame.
[00:58:30.364 --> 00:58:30.985]  The t-shirts.
[00:58:30.985 --> 00:58:31.585]  The materials.
[00:58:31.585 --> 00:58:32.546]  Spread the word.
[00:58:32.546 --> 00:58:35.488]  Wake people up and support the transmission.
[00:58:35.488 --> 00:58:36.869]  InfoWars.com.
[00:58:36.869 --> 00:58:42.033]  We've got the lowest prices ever right now on the films.
[00:58:42.033 --> 00:58:45.555]  You are listening to GCN.

[00:58:54.645 --> 00:58:55.906]  Tyranny is here.
[00:58:55.906 --> 00:58:59.450]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:58:59.450 --> 00:59:02.072]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:59:02.072 --> 00:59:07.937]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:59:07.937 --> 00:59:14.183]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:59:14.603 --> 00:59:20.584]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:59:20.584 --> 00:59:24.765]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:59:24.765 --> 00:59:29.046]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:59:29.046 --> 00:59:34.987]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:59:34.987 --> 00:59:38.547]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:59:38.547 --> 00:59:40.508]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:59:40.508 --> 00:59:40.948]  It's here.

[00:59:53.421 --> 00:59:55.823]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.823 --> 00:59:58.606]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.151 --> 01:00:09.975]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.975 --> 01:00:11.556]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.556 --> 01:00:13.097]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.097 --> 01:00:17.300]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:21.363]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:25.102]  We got Max Keiser coming up.
[01:00:25.102 --> 01:00:27.844]  We're going to get into the secrets of water.
[01:00:27.844 --> 01:00:33.369]  I thought the secret FEMA camp episode on conspiracy theory with Jesse Ventura was powerful.
[01:00:33.369 --> 01:00:38.653]  The JFK piece, deathbed confessions by the hitmen, you name it, off the charts.
[01:00:38.653 --> 01:00:41.215]  Never before on national television.
[01:00:41.215 --> 01:00:45.259]  Now I've been given the full details of the episode airing tomorrow night that I'm in.
[01:00:45.259 --> 01:00:46.059]  They've got it all.
[01:00:46.059 --> 01:00:50.143]  The fluoride in your water, the uranium in your water, that's coming up in the third hour.
[01:00:52.714 --> 01:01:01.459]  But I know this is old news for our audience, but it's new news for the rest of the world, and we are getting some new details.
[01:01:01.459 --> 01:01:11.425]  Trillions of dollars of your tax money pumped into foreign banks, pumped into MSNBC, pumped into other Fortune 100 companies.
[01:01:11.425 --> 01:01:14.067]  21,000 transactions.
[01:01:17.324 --> 01:01:19.006]  Are still secret.
[01:01:19.006 --> 01:01:26.532]  They are keeping secret data for $885 billion in financial crisis loans.
[01:01:26.532 --> 01:01:31.637]  Those are 0% interest.
[01:01:31.637 --> 01:01:39.204]  Fed withholds collateral data for $885 billion in financial crisis loans.
[01:01:39.204 --> 01:01:40.005]  Your tax money.
[01:01:41.035 --> 01:01:48.989]  The Federal Reserve withheld details and you notice all these banks and companies are out setting up credit divisions with 15 to 30 percent interest.
[01:01:48.989 --> 01:01:51.033]  Notice your credit card interest went up.
[01:01:51.033 --> 01:01:51.994]  They get zero percent.
[01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:55.991]  Oh yeah, the Fed rate's down at zero right now.
[01:01:55.991 --> 01:01:57.733]  But you don't get that, Jack.
[01:01:57.733 --> 01:01:59.915]  This is for the banks, not you.
[01:01:59.915 --> 01:02:12.945]  The Federal Reserve withheld details on individual securities pledges collateral by receipts of $885 billion in central bank loans, denying taxpayers a measure of the risk they face from its emergency aid.
[01:02:12.945 --> 01:02:14.507]  This is only one type of loans.
[01:02:14.507 --> 01:02:19.511]  They've got other just pure debt creation and the derivatives they're still pumping.
[01:02:19.511 --> 01:02:21.593]  See, they take a lot of this money and invest it in new derivatives.
[01:02:22.619 --> 01:02:23.019]  We're good
[01:02:44.412 --> 01:02:46.713]  As many or even more transactions.
[01:02:46.713 --> 01:02:49.553]  They won't even say that number.
[01:02:49.553 --> 01:02:59.896]  July's Dodd-Frank law required the Fed to disclose the names of borrowers, the size of the interest rate in loans, and information identifying the types of amounts of collateral pledged or assets transferred.
[01:02:59.896 --> 01:03:04.757]  Then again, the Federal Reserve gets those assets through their puppets they control in the Treasury.
[01:03:06.305 --> 01:03:18.275]  For three of the Fed's six emergency facilities, the central bank released information on groups of collateral it accepted by asset type and rating without specifically identifying securities.
[01:03:18.275 --> 01:03:19.576]  So again, half of them.
[01:03:19.576 --> 01:03:27.982]  Among those was the primary dealer credit facility, created in March of 2008 to provide loans to brokers at Bear Stearns Co., collapsed.
[01:03:28.885 --> 01:03:36.409]  They go on to say this is a half step, said former Atlanta Fed Research Director Robert Eisenbeiss, Chief Monetary Economist.
[01:03:36.409 --> 01:03:41.671]  Hey, get Professor Black from Kansas State back on.
[01:03:41.671 --> 01:03:42.632]  Thank you.
[01:03:42.632 --> 01:03:43.893]  I want to get Black back on.
[01:03:43.893 --> 01:03:45.753]  I forget the first name.
[01:03:45.753 --> 01:03:47.294]  We've had him on.
[01:03:47.294 --> 01:03:49.816]  What?
[01:03:49.816 --> 01:03:50.356]  I can't hear you.
[01:03:50.356 --> 01:03:50.476]  What?
[01:03:51.636 --> 01:03:51.996]  That's it.
[01:03:51.996 --> 01:03:52.857]  William K. Black.
[01:03:52.857 --> 01:03:53.277]  That's right.
[01:03:53.277 --> 01:03:53.977]  Good job, Marley.
[01:03:53.977 --> 01:03:55.078]  I don't know how you remember that.
[01:03:55.078 --> 01:03:56.098]  Got a good memory there.
[01:03:56.098 --> 01:03:56.879]  William K. Black.
[01:03:56.879 --> 01:03:59.980]  Yes, he's in Fall of the Republic.
[01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:07.684]  Continues there on that front.
[01:04:07.684 --> 01:04:11.306]  I've got a bunch of other just insane news on this front as well.
[01:04:12.475 --> 01:04:15.938]  European banks took big slice of Fed aid.
[01:04:15.938 --> 01:04:20.562]  Fed's ID companies that use crisis aid programs.
[01:04:20.562 --> 01:04:23.984]  Bank of America becoming Bank of Asia as revenue rises 30%.
[01:04:23.984 --> 01:04:30.490]  Oh yeah, they're all record bonuses, record profits at our expense.
[01:04:30.490 --> 01:04:31.671]  That's Bloomberg.
[01:04:31.671 --> 01:04:36.855]  Citigroup may hire Obama's former budget chief, who was part of the inside dealing.
[01:04:36.855 --> 01:04:38.116]  Talk about public payoffs.
[01:04:41.570 --> 01:04:46.774]  America is held hostage by private global bankers.
[01:04:46.774 --> 01:04:48.315]  It's all coming up.
[01:04:48.315 --> 01:04:50.857]  I want to get into the food safety bill is in trouble.
[01:04:50.857 --> 01:04:52.939]  It's all part of a larger power grab.
[01:04:52.939 --> 01:05:00.445]  Max Keiser's move to deal with JP Morgan's getting a lot of traction.
[01:05:02.625 --> 01:05:04.365]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:04.365 --> 01:05:10.086]  You've heard me talk about the delicious, easy-to-fix, and very storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:05:10.086 --> 01:05:14.827]  I've told you for years that eFoodsDirect has the best storable food on the planet.
[01:05:14.827 --> 01:05:18.568]  Now it's that time of year again, and their holiday special is here.
[01:05:18.568 --> 01:05:25.509]  They have two holiday price packs for you to put into your reserves for a secure future or to share with others.
[01:05:25.509 --> 01:05:28.330]  The first is a six-month bulk supply in 10 cans.

[01:06:00.216 --> 01:06:04.759]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:04.759 --> 01:06:05.680]  Number one.
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:09.102]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:09.102 --> 01:06:09.963]  Number two.
[01:06:09.963 --> 01:06:14.846]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:14.846 --> 01:06:15.606]  It's true.
[01:06:15.606 --> 01:06:20.470]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:21.290]  Number three.
[01:06:21.290 --> 01:06:24.872]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:24.872 --> 01:06:28.555]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:28.775 --> 01:06:29.576]  Number 4.
[01:06:29.576 --> 01:06:32.339]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:32.339 --> 01:06:36.023]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:36.023 --> 01:06:36.803]  Number 5.
[01:06:36.803 --> 01:06:40.968]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:40.968 --> 01:06:45.733]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:07:58.422 --> 01:08:01.645]  Thank you.
[01:08:01.645 --> 01:08:07.229]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:11.966 --> 01:08:35.803]  In the last few months, there's been grassroots scuttlebutt abounding with the fact that even congressional reports and SEC hearings have had to admit that JPMorgan Chase and others are naked shorting the silver market a hundred to one or more.
[01:08:37.421 --> 01:08:42.626]  They don't have the silver, but they're in the market manipulating it, driving the price down.
[01:08:42.626 --> 01:08:58.363]  If you go out and physically buy silver, if just three or four million people, depending on what estimate you look at, go out and buy just a few ounces, it will force JP Morgan and other powerful private fellow reserve owners
[01:08:59.909 --> 01:09:08.877]  To come out and try to basically pay off the bets they've made and they don't have the money.
[01:09:08.877 --> 01:09:19.707]  And so this is a grassroots thing that started, I remember hearing this over a decade ago, people talking about how we could do this, but now enough people are educated about it that it's happening again.
[01:09:19.707 --> 01:09:26.173]  Now the Hunt brothers tried this back in 1980, but even though they were billionaires, they couldn't
[01:09:28.638 --> 01:09:39.583]  Stand up against the hundreds of billionaires, the entire globalist swarm, coming in and basically destroying them financially.
[01:09:39.583 --> 01:09:45.305]  Now the Hunt brothers were able to corner the market, drive up to $50 an ounce in 1980.
[01:09:45.305 --> 01:09:51.548]  But now, here's the zero hedge report, Max Keiser's plan to destroy JP Morgan goes mainstream
[01:09:52.836 --> 01:09:56.659]  After the Guardian post, his silver squeeze thoughts.
[01:09:56.659 --> 01:09:59.600]  And here's that London Guardian report, written by Max Keiser.
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:01.562]  He gives us a nice plug.
[01:10:01.562 --> 01:10:02.883]  Want JP Morgan to crash?
[01:10:02.883 --> 01:10:04.023]  Buy silver.
[01:10:04.023 --> 01:10:08.726]  And yes, about a month ago, and then again a week and a half ago, he launched this here on the show.
[01:10:08.726 --> 01:10:16.071]  It has turbocharged it since then, and we're starting to see record prices for silver.
[01:10:16.071 --> 01:10:20.574]  Silver's up 9% since this started in the particular area.
[01:10:21.715 --> 01:10:22.616]  We're good to go.
[01:10:48.019 --> 01:10:54.562]  Who we played a few days ago who made that the madness of a lost society just search the term We are the modern-day hunt brothers.
[01:10:54.562 --> 01:11:10.169]  I'm gonna have Aaron Dykes when he gets in he was up here late last night post this at info wars.com And we're gonna post this video at GCN live.com But I wanted to go ahead and play this video in audio now for you to show the power of what's starting at the grassroots here it is
[01:11:17.242 --> 01:11:23.766]  In 1973, the wealthy Hunt family of Texas decided to buy precious metals as a hedge against inflation.
[01:11:23.766 --> 01:11:30.549]  The Hunts recognized the dangers of Nixon's decision at Rothschild agent Henry Kissinger's urging to close the gold window.
[01:11:30.549 --> 01:11:32.310]  The Hunts believed in hard money.
[01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:40.375]  And since the Hunts were billionaires, and at the time owning gold was illegal for Americans, the Hunts turned their attention to the common man's metal, silver.
[01:11:40.615 --> 01:11:44.216]  Which didn't sit well with the central bankers who own the printing press.
[01:11:44.216 --> 01:11:49.378]  The Hunts were targeted and made to pay for their folly, and eventually lost most of their fortune.
[01:11:49.378 --> 01:11:50.819]  Flash forward today.
[01:11:50.819 --> 01:11:56.901]  Fiat paper still rules, and the Fed's QE2 promises to destroy what remains of confidence in our dollar.
[01:11:56.901 --> 01:12:01.463]  And like the Hunt brothers, people around the world are waking up to the dangers of a fiat system.
[01:12:01.463 --> 01:12:04.664]  Like the Hunt brothers, we are advocates of hard money.
[01:12:04.664 --> 01:12:06.025]  Constitutional money.
[01:12:06.025 --> 01:12:08.746]  But, unlike the Hunts, we will not be defeated.
[01:12:08.746 --> 01:12:10.668]  We are united and we will not stand down.
[01:12:10.668 --> 01:12:12.050]  We are united.
[01:12:12.050 --> 01:12:13.051]  We stand together.
[01:12:13.051 --> 01:12:15.273]  I own physical silver.
[01:12:15.273 --> 01:12:17.095]  I own physical silver.
[01:12:17.095 --> 01:12:17.856]  Physical silver.
[01:12:17.856 --> 01:12:19.918]  I own physical silver.
[01:12:19.918 --> 01:12:21.480]  I own physical silver.
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:23.022]  I own physical silver.
[01:12:23.022 --> 01:12:24.063]  I own physical.
[01:12:24.063 --> 01:12:28.888]  We have identified the criminal banker's Achilles heel and it's physical silver.
[01:12:28.888 --> 01:12:29.869]  We stand together.
[01:12:32.910 --> 01:12:33.230]  We're good to go.
[01:12:55.121 --> 01:12:59.662]  5,000 ounces of silver and the big banks aren't even going to get half an ounce of it.
[01:12:59.662 --> 01:13:01.382]  215 ounces of physical silver.
[01:13:01.382 --> 01:13:03.323]  That's 5 ounces.
[01:13:03.323 --> 01:13:04.683]  300 ounces of silver.
[01:13:04.683 --> 01:13:06.044]  5 ounces.
[01:13:06.044 --> 01:13:09.144]  500 ounces of physical silver.
[01:13:09.144 --> 01:13:18.986]  These same banks, who once had the power to bring down the Hunt brothers, cannot bring down thousands and thousands of us, standing shoulder to shoulder, backed by knowledge, backed by physical.
[01:13:18.986 --> 01:13:21.147]  There's billions of people out there just like you.
[01:13:21.707 --> 01:13:23.432]  Against the criminal bankers.
[01:13:23.432 --> 01:13:26.579]  We stand united against the criminal banks.
[01:13:30.147 --> 01:13:31.627]  We will fight!
[01:13:31.627 --> 01:13:36.388]  Your corruption has been revealed, and your criminality can no longer hide in the shadows.
[01:13:36.388 --> 01:13:40.449]  The weak, immoral men behind the curtain now have a very, very big problem.
[01:13:40.449 --> 01:13:42.650]  Humanity hungers for liberty.
[01:13:42.650 --> 01:13:47.011]  This is our time, and we are backed by physical silver.
[01:13:47.011 --> 01:13:47.771]  We are.
[01:13:47.771 --> 01:13:48.411]  We are.
[01:13:48.411 --> 01:13:49.251]  We are.
[01:13:49.251 --> 01:13:51.772]  We are the Modern Day Hunt Brothers.
[01:13:51.772 --> 01:13:53.252]  The Modern Day Hunt Brothers.
[01:13:53.252 --> 01:13:54.893]  The Modern Day Hunt Brothers.
[01:13:54.893 --> 01:13:56.833]  We are the Modern Day Hunt Brothers.
[01:13:57.213 --> 01:14:02.317]  Buy physical silver and bring down the criminal banks.
[01:14:02.317 --> 01:14:03.998]  Take that, Mr. J.P.
[01:14:03.998 --> 01:14:08.922]  Morgan.
[01:14:08.922 --> 01:14:16.107]  All right, great job.
[01:14:17.332 --> 01:14:28.959]  It's got a little bit more left of the video and the actual name of the video is Modern Day Hunt Brothers Crash JPMorgan Buy Physical Silver and it's from the YouTube channel SGTBull07.
[01:14:28.959 --> 01:14:31.140]  Really great videos on that channel.
[01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:34.422]  They cannot stop us all and that's what this radio show is.
[01:14:34.422 --> 01:14:39.065]  It's a platform to bring on other great activists, other great minds to give attention
[01:14:39.645 --> 01:14:44.988]  To other great people fighting online, putting out their passion, having an effect.
[01:14:44.988 --> 01:14:49.210]  It's beautiful what we can do together.
[01:14:49.210 --> 01:15:00.716]  Now, the Fed has put out data on around a trillion of the money they've handed out, but Bloomberg reports there's another 885 billion that they're keeping secret.
[01:15:02.213 --> 01:15:14.955]  And it's also confirmed by the Washington Post that MSNBC and NBC TV illegally did not tell the public or even the IRS that they'd gotten money from the federal government.
[01:15:14.955 --> 01:15:19.056]  But see, they're all above the law.
[01:15:19.056 --> 01:15:29.358]  I was just, during the break, we've got Fox News and CNN on, with the sound off, and they had text on the screen saying the IRS is gonna demand double
[01:15:31.738 --> 01:15:38.181]  Tax filings this year, and they're trying to pass laws to where the CPAs basically work for the IRS.
[01:15:38.181 --> 01:15:41.022]  I mean, they're getting rid of all the tax exemptions.
[01:15:41.022 --> 01:15:42.742]  They're totally squeezing everybody.
[01:15:42.742 --> 01:15:48.405]  Meanwhile, Google pays 2.4% tax.
[01:15:48.405 --> 01:15:53.007]  They've written it where billionaires pay almost nothing.
[01:15:53.007 --> 01:16:01.150]  But if you're somebody making $200,000 a year and you got 10, 15 employees, you've got to buy insurance for all of them, which cuts their pay.
[01:16:03.433 --> 01:16:08.374]  And then every week hundreds and hundreds of new companies are announced.
[01:16:08.374 --> 01:16:13.255]  Walmart, McDonald's, Burger King, you name it.
[01:16:13.255 --> 01:16:15.796]  Jack in the box.
[01:16:15.796 --> 01:16:21.397]  They don't have to get insurance for their employees.
[01:16:21.397 --> 01:16:25.818]  Just like these mega corporations get your tax money and bailouts secretly.
[01:16:25.818 --> 01:16:27.378]  No one can compete against this!
[01:16:29.005 --> 01:16:31.126]  This is corporate fascism.
[01:16:31.126 --> 01:16:35.867]  And I've always explained this to political scientists.
[01:16:35.867 --> 01:16:44.830]  The corporate fascists always fund socialism to consolidate the general public's wealth to get people dependent so they can hold them hostage through their pension funds.
[01:16:45.956 --> 01:16:50.198]  So it's socialism sits on the bottom with fascism on top.
[01:16:50.198 --> 01:16:52.619]  You don't have socialist and fascist countries.
[01:16:52.619 --> 01:16:53.980]  They always go together.
[01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:57.421]  You have a socialist system with a fascist system sitting on top.
[01:16:57.421 --> 01:17:00.343]  And you try to talk to liberal intellectuals, they can't get this.
[01:17:00.343 --> 01:17:06.546]  You try to talk to conservative intellectuals, they can't get it.
[01:17:06.546 --> 01:17:09.087]  It's a false paradigm.
[01:17:09.087 --> 01:17:11.008]  History is right out in front of all of you.
[01:17:16.997 --> 01:17:20.760]  I was talking to a leading magazine reporter a few weeks ago, and he did get it.
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:23.162]  He goes, no, I remember reading a book called Small is Beautiful.
[01:17:23.162 --> 01:17:24.342]  I haven't read it yet.
[01:17:24.342 --> 01:17:30.487]  You know, dealing with that, and that's something that socialists and people need to get through their brains, okay?
[01:17:30.487 --> 01:17:35.451]  If you have a socialist system, big megabanks are going to come in.
[01:17:37.179 --> 01:17:43.203]  And they are going to lobby and take over that money trough that's been created.
[01:17:43.203 --> 01:17:46.626]  Individuals are never going to get that trough, even if you believe in socialism.
[01:17:46.626 --> 01:17:49.728]  All right, shifting back to the silver situation.
[01:17:49.728 --> 01:17:50.969]  Silver's going up.
[01:17:50.969 --> 01:17:53.410]  Gold is right up at $1,400 a day.
[01:17:53.410 --> 01:17:54.711]  The silver is running out.
[01:17:54.711 --> 01:17:56.232]  That's mainstream news.
[01:17:56.232 --> 01:18:02.877]  It looks like this routing of the banksters and calling their bluff on their manipulation of silver and gold can happen.
[01:18:04.161 --> 01:18:06.662]  And they may drive it down later, but we just keep buying.
[01:18:06.662 --> 01:18:07.843]  They can't do it forever.
[01:18:07.843 --> 01:18:10.504]  Ted Anderson, what do you think of the video we just covered?
[01:18:10.504 --> 01:18:13.046]  Hey, the video sounds like a great production.
[01:18:13.046 --> 01:18:16.108]  I can't wait to get back to my computer to watch that thing.
[01:18:16.108 --> 01:18:18.929]  I can tell you right now, silver is a hot buy.
[01:18:18.929 --> 01:18:22.411]  I mean, we're sitting right now with silver seeing a peak today of $29.05 an ounce.
[01:18:22.411 --> 01:18:23.912]  Gold only 30 cents away from $1,400 an ounce now.
[01:18:31.736 --> 01:18:36.417]  Do you realize that China increased their imports on gold by five times?
[01:18:36.417 --> 01:18:37.058]  Just short of that.
[01:18:37.058 --> 01:18:37.318]  Five times!
[01:18:37.318 --> 01:18:43.299]  Well, the majority of futures for the end of the month, Bloomberg reported, are 1,500 an ounce for gold.
[01:18:43.299 --> 01:18:51.322]  I don't know if that's going to happen, but the issue here is, Ted, you bought this silver and gold when the globalists ran it down, knowing it would shoot right back up.
[01:18:51.322 --> 01:18:55.183]  You can offer the silver and gold at a lower price right now, but not for long.
[01:18:55.183 --> 01:18:55.883]  It's going to run out.
[01:18:56.303 --> 01:19:02.206]  Well, certainly for the same prices I could have earlier this week, with silver $3 lower than where it is right now.
[01:19:02.206 --> 01:19:04.347]  Alright, tell folks what you got silver for right now, specifically.
[01:19:04.347 --> 01:19:10.751]  Well, right now the best thing that we have is the Walking Liberties at $12.84, but we have, you know, we have bags of silver, we have...
[01:19:11.491 --> 01:19:12.252]  Here's what's going on.
[01:19:12.252 --> 01:19:13.373]  I mean, the U.S.
[01:19:13.373 --> 01:19:15.975]  Silver Eagles right now, we're getting those finally.
[01:19:15.975 --> 01:19:19.358]  Man, it's just been, like, pulling teeth.
[01:19:19.358 --> 01:19:23.662]  The price of 1-ounce silver bars and 100-ounce bars, U.S.
[01:19:23.662 --> 01:19:26.024]  Eagles and all that stuff are breaking away.
[01:19:26.024 --> 01:19:31.709]  The physical market's breaking away from the futures market because the futures market is all smoke and mirrors.
[01:19:31.709 --> 01:19:34.191]  It's all leverage, and they don't even have enough silver.
[01:19:35.172 --> 01:19:38.716]  I got a big announcement, but 800-686-2237.
[01:19:38.716 --> 01:19:39.136]  800-686-2237.
[01:19:39.136 --> 01:19:46.984]  Ted has the best deals you'll find anywhere on silver half dollars, silver dollars, you name it.
[01:19:46.984 --> 01:19:48.185]  Give him a call.
[01:19:48.185 --> 01:19:51.529]  Take that physical possession and destroy the globalists.
[01:19:51.529 --> 01:19:53.811]  800-686-2237.
[01:19:53.811 --> 01:19:55.092]  Stay there, Ted.
[01:19:55.092 --> 01:19:56.534]  Let's explain what's happening.
[01:19:56.534 --> 01:19:57.575]  The silver is running out.
[01:20:00.963 --> 01:20:05.047]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:20:05.047 --> 01:20:09.551]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:20:09.551 --> 01:20:15.477]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:20:15.717 --> 01:20:18.139]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:20:18.139 --> 01:20:24.242]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:20:24.242 --> 01:20:27.644]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:20:27.644 --> 01:20:29.526]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:20:29.526 --> 01:20:31.507]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[01:20:31.707 --> 01:20:37.369]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days, guaranteed.
[01:20:37.369 --> 01:20:41.671]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[01:20:41.671 --> 01:20:49.733]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.
[01:20:49.733 --> 01:20:50.454]  800-477-9256 or zerodetguaranteed.com.
[01:20:50.454 --> 01:20:51.274]  800-477-9256 or zerodetguaranteed.com.
[01:21:00.558 --> 01:21:04.719]  In a coming apart world, you need something to keep it tied together.
[01:21:04.719 --> 01:21:06.580]  That something is Atwood Rope.
[01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:08.700]  The highest quality rope made in the USA.
[01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:14.522]  From exotic braids for military, rescue, arborist, shipyards, towline, or boating.

[01:21:26.925 --> 01:21:27.825]  Atwood Rope.
[01:21:27.825 --> 01:21:29.686]  Working to keep the world tied together.
[01:21:30.186 --> 01:21:31.427]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:31.427 --> 01:21:36.010]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:21:36.010 --> 01:21:41.814]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:21:41.814 --> 01:21:45.456]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:21:45.456 --> 01:21:48.278]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:48.278 --> 01:21:53.241]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:21:53.241 --> 01:21:53.482]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:53.482 --> 01:21:54.883]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:00.426 --> 01:22:04.648]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:22:04.648 --> 01:22:05.909]  Tyranny is here.
[01:22:05.909 --> 01:22:09.830]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:12.071]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:22:12.071 --> 01:22:17.934]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[01:22:17.934 --> 01:22:24.177]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:22:24.597 --> 01:22:30.539]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:22:30.539 --> 01:22:34.740]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:39.041]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:22:39.041 --> 01:22:44.983]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:22:44.983 --> 01:22:48.544]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:22:48.544 --> 01:22:50.525]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:22:50.525 --> 01:22:50.945]  It's here.

[01:22:59.943 --> 01:23:03.385]  The largest part of gaining radiant health is detoxification.
[01:23:03.385 --> 01:23:11.209]  You can drink ionized water, cleanse your intestines, eat a perfect diet, and even take lots of quality supplements and in many instances only make minimal progress.
[01:23:11.209 --> 01:23:15.752]  What is the key to detoxifying your body of mercury, heavy metals, chemicals, and drugs?
[01:23:15.752 --> 01:23:17.213]  It is glutathione.
[01:23:17.213 --> 01:23:21.275]  Glutathione is the master antioxidant used to detoxify your entire body.
[01:23:21.275 --> 01:23:24.637]  It stops free radicals, keeps cells young, and reduces inflammation.
[01:23:25.257 --> 01:23:31.039]  One World Whey Protein Powder may be able to raise your glutathione production by 64% or more.
[01:23:31.039 --> 01:23:38.302]  One World Whey is more effective than any other whey protein powder on the market because it is unheated and from grass-fed cows.
[01:23:38.302 --> 01:23:43.164]  All other, quote, cold processed whey protein powders have been heated and damaged by 15% or more.
[01:23:44.725 --> 01:23:47.127]  One World Whey comes in three delicious flavors.
[01:23:47.127 --> 01:23:47.527]  Call 888-988-3325.
[01:23:47.527 --> 01:23:47.748]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:23:47.748 --> 01:23:49.049]  Or visit OneWorldWhey.com.
[01:23:49.049 --> 01:23:50.330]  That's One World W-H-E-Y dot com.
[01:24:20.871 --> 01:24:26.877]  Now, to be specific, silver's up to $29 an ounce right now and rising.
[01:24:26.877 --> 01:24:28.559]  Gold is only 30 cents away.
[01:24:28.559 --> 01:24:32.603]  $1,400, that's psychological barrier.
[01:24:32.603 --> 01:24:38.970]  It's even come out in congressional reports that we've covered here that the mega banks are suppressing gold and silver.
[01:24:38.970 --> 01:24:43.114]  They are in the market, but I have never seen
[01:24:44.212 --> 01:24:44.673]  We're good to go.
[01:25:03.993 --> 01:25:05.434]  And what it's selling for.
[01:25:05.434 --> 01:25:11.897]  That said, the real market, it's trading way silver, way above the 29.
[01:25:11.897 --> 01:25:13.878]  In gold, way above the 1,400.
[01:25:13.878 --> 01:25:20.300]  There's huge premiums if you can get it, almost everywhere.
[01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:25.343]  Ted has been around 30 plus years, in the Midas incarnation for what, 13, 14 years?
[01:25:25.343 --> 01:25:26.803]  Or I guess, yeah, it's 14 years.
[01:25:29.676 --> 01:25:33.338]  He's got the connections and he's having trouble, but he's not greedy.
[01:25:33.338 --> 01:25:35.879]  He bought it in the last few weeks when they drove it down.
[01:25:35.879 --> 01:25:38.580]  He's got it for you now that it's going up at the old price.
[01:25:38.580 --> 01:25:43.882]  Specifically and briefly, Ted, get into what you're facing, what you're seeing.
[01:25:43.882 --> 01:25:45.183]  I got a big announcement coming up here.
[01:25:45.183 --> 01:25:48.144]  It may have to be in the next segment.
[01:25:48.144 --> 01:25:49.085]  Explain to people
[01:25:50.475 --> 01:25:55.660]  The type of drying up you're seeing from your perspective and, briefly, what you've got for them today.
[01:25:55.660 --> 01:26:02.227]  Well, just people need to understand, when the banks are in manipulating the price of silver by selling short contracts, that's just it.
[01:26:02.227 --> 01:26:03.068]  They're contracts.
[01:26:03.068 --> 01:26:04.810]  It's not physical.
[01:26:04.810 --> 01:26:06.712]  We're looking at premiums driving up.
[01:26:06.712 --> 01:26:13.358]  I mean, that Buffalo coin just went over $130 over spot just to buy a Buffalo in the wholesale market.
[01:26:13.979 --> 01:26:16.141]  I mean, that's before I even get my hands on it.
[01:26:16.141 --> 01:26:22.065]  I mean, the relationship between physical eagles and the spot silver.
[01:26:22.065 --> 01:26:25.368]  Bars of 100 ounce bars of silver, it doesn't matter what you're picking up.
[01:26:25.368 --> 01:26:36.196]  That's like in Venezuela when Hugo Chavez says rice costs this by the pound or a gallon of petrol costs this, but in his socialist system it really costs a lot more on the ground.
[01:26:36.196 --> 01:26:39.639]  And so now we're living in the La La Land where, you know, they say
[01:26:40.439 --> 01:26:44.481]  Uh, that unemployment's 9.6, but every other economist says it's pushing 23%.
[01:26:44.481 --> 01:26:49.464]  I mean, we're now seeing the pure la-la land being illustrated.
[01:26:49.464 --> 01:26:50.424]  That's exactly right.
[01:26:50.424 --> 01:26:57.908]  Too much manipulation, and you can't do it in the physical market, so the physical market's showing what's really going on, and it's clearly across the board.
[01:26:57.908 --> 01:27:00.269]  Every single dealer in the United States is dealing with it.
[01:27:00.849 --> 01:27:01.330]  I don't
[01:27:20.629 --> 01:27:25.915]  We've got the other deal with the three silver dollars, three of my films, and free shipping for how much?
[01:27:25.915 --> 01:27:27.217]  It's 97 bucks.
[01:27:27.217 --> 01:27:28.639]  It's delivered to people.
[01:27:28.639 --> 01:27:30.201]  I mean, that's unheard of.
[01:27:30.201 --> 01:27:33.805]  I mean, the Walking Liberty half coin right now at $12.84.
[01:27:33.805 --> 01:27:36.288]  I mean, silver's almost 30 bucks an ounce now.
[01:27:36.608 --> 01:27:39.409]  They've got to tell them it's the radio special to take advantage of this.
[01:27:39.409 --> 01:27:41.550]  The web prices are a little more, still great deals.
[01:27:41.550 --> 01:27:42.650]  800-686-2237.
[01:27:42.650 --> 01:27:45.151]  800-686-2237.
[01:27:45.151 --> 01:27:49.692]  Has gold gone above $1,400 since we started talking?
[01:27:49.692 --> 01:27:53.134]  No, we're just, I'm looking at it right now, it's just hovering right at that level.
[01:27:53.134 --> 01:27:54.934]  It's just at like the $1,399 level.
[01:27:54.934 --> 01:27:57.995]  Let me just refresh right now and take a quick peek.
[01:27:57.995 --> 01:28:00.676]  $1,399 presently right now at $1,399.70 is the peak right now.
[01:28:03.597 --> 01:28:07.459]  All right.
[01:28:07.459 --> 01:28:08.879]  800-686-2237.
[01:28:08.879 --> 01:28:09.440]  800-686-2237.
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:11.501]  Lastly, Ted, how long can you hold these prices?
[01:28:11.501 --> 01:28:14.762]  Well, we're holding them until midnight tonight and then we'll see what happens tomorrow.
[01:28:14.762 --> 01:28:15.022]  All right.
[01:28:15.022 --> 01:28:16.002]  Great job, Ted.
[01:28:16.002 --> 01:28:17.043]  800-686-2237.
[01:28:17.043 --> 01:28:21.945]  The gold and silver market hot as a pistol as global devaluation accelerates.
[01:28:21.945 --> 01:28:22.525]  All right.
[01:28:22.525 --> 01:28:23.626]  I'll get into this briefly.
[01:28:23.626 --> 01:28:26.107]  I'll announce it more in the days to come.
[01:28:27.896 --> 01:28:27.916]  I
[01:28:45.097 --> 01:28:45.817]  We're good to go.
[01:29:00.566 --> 01:29:04.207]  And we never hire from the listeners because infiltrators could try to get in.
[01:29:04.207 --> 01:29:05.127]  I don't want fans.
[01:29:05.127 --> 01:29:06.808]  I want supporters.
[01:29:06.808 --> 01:29:08.068]  I want to pay people, too.
[01:29:08.068 --> 01:29:10.929]  But if you want to volunteer, the full spectrum's wide open.
[01:29:10.929 --> 01:29:12.730]  But I want to do this in the next few months.
[01:29:12.730 --> 01:29:19.812]  It's mainly a WordPress developer or developers to build around a WordPress-based social network.
[01:29:19.812 --> 01:29:22.153]  We've also got one built in Drupal.
[01:29:22.153 --> 01:29:23.613]  That's what the White House website's in.
[01:29:23.613 --> 01:29:28.135]  But the issue here is jobs at InfoWars.com.
[01:29:29.295 --> 01:29:34.057]  Okay, but if you're not, we've got a good portfolio and sources we can check.
[01:29:34.057 --> 01:29:38.619]  I mean, please, only serious folks, but JobsAtInfoWars.com.
[01:29:38.619 --> 01:29:40.199]  I've never pulled directly from the audience.
[01:29:40.199 --> 01:29:46.161]  We want you to be in Austin, Texas, or in Central Texas, and to be able to be here on-site.
[01:29:46.161 --> 01:29:48.022]  JobsAtInfoWars.com.
[01:29:48.022 --> 01:29:49.303]  I want this launched by February.
[01:29:49.303 --> 01:29:50.843]  I'm tired of screwing around.
[01:29:50.843 --> 01:29:52.244]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.244 --> 01:29:54.785]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.785 --> 01:29:57.466]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:02.318 --> 01:31:04.079]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:04.079 --> 01:31:09.783]  You've heard me talk about the delicious, easy-to-fix, and very storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.

[01:32:00.034 --> 01:32:03.877]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[01:32:03.877 --> 01:32:08.141]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[01:32:08.141 --> 01:32:12.845]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[01:32:12.845 --> 01:32:18.790]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:32:18.790 --> 01:32:22.053]  Not worried about them moving south.
[01:32:22.053 --> 01:32:25.756]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:32:28.742 --> 01:32:35.226]  We're American and be proud.
[01:32:35.226 --> 01:32:38.469]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:32:54.525 --> 01:33:05.648]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:33:05.648 --> 01:33:07.348]  Big Brother.
[01:33:07.348 --> 01:33:09.688]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:09.688 --> 01:33:11.429]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:11.429 --> 01:33:13.549]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:13.549 --> 01:33:15.690]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:15.690 --> 01:33:20.391]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.275 --> 01:33:31.837]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:31.837 --> 01:33:33.299]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:33:33.299 --> 01:33:36.241]  Max Keiser's got it in the London Guardian.
[01:33:36.241 --> 01:33:42.707]  His plan to crash JP Morgan by showing that they've been manipulating the market and driving it down.
[01:33:42.707 --> 01:33:46.751]  Silver surging towards all-time record $29 a day.
[01:33:46.751 --> 01:33:49.554]  Bloomberg and others report there's record low supplies of it.
[01:33:50.274 --> 01:33:53.695]  And the manipulation of the gold and silver market is really becoming more and more evident.
[01:33:53.695 --> 01:33:55.056]  He's going to be joining us.
[01:33:55.056 --> 01:33:58.877]  Michael Braverman of Jesse Ventura's television show is going to break some news.
[01:33:58.877 --> 01:34:04.879]  It's going to be airing tomorrow night, dealing with multinational corporations coming in and buying up the water supplies.
[01:34:04.879 --> 01:34:08.420]  That is all coming up as well in the next hour.
[01:34:08.420 --> 01:34:10.720]  Joe C. Hewson.
[01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:12.221]  Am I pronouncing that right, guys?
[01:34:14.235 --> 01:34:28.458]  C. Hewson is the President and CEO of an amazing organization, and that's Liberty Guard, founded and headed up by former Congressman Bob Barr, a Libertarian presidential candidate, in 2008.
[01:34:28.458 --> 01:34:32.559]  And we really appreciate Mr. C. Hewson for coming on the broadcast with us.
[01:34:32.559 --> 01:34:33.919]  The website's libertyguard.org.
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:41.003]  And we've got these reports out on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:34:41.003 --> 01:34:45.745]  Watchdog probes DHS spying on Drudge and others.
[01:34:45.745 --> 01:34:46.886]  FOIA requests
[01:34:48.743 --> 01:34:53.245]  Investigates whether critics of TSA are being listed as domestic extremists.
[01:34:53.245 --> 01:34:58.947]  And then continuing, we have another headline, Bob Barr investigates TSA stand down on National Opt Out Day.
[01:34:58.947 --> 01:35:02.869]  Here's their own headline, TSA manipulates National Opt Out Day.
[01:35:02.869 --> 01:35:08.972]  Liberty Guard files the FOIA request to TSA regarding political manipulation.
[01:35:08.972 --> 01:35:12.893]  So he's with us for the rest of the hour.
[01:35:12.893 --> 01:35:14.194]  Joe, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:35:14.775 --> 01:35:27.504]  Thanks for coming on Alex and thanks for your leadership on this issue and our chairman Bob Barr and our group LibertyGuard.org picked up on a lot of that and went ahead and filed this and we're hoping to get to the bottom of this.
[01:35:29.068 --> 01:35:50.010]  We think it's a pretty serious issue, which is the potential that the TSA has manipulated the potential of protests from these opt-out folks that would not choose willingly to go through this sort of degrading and questionably constitutional procedure.
[01:35:50.010 --> 01:35:51.612]  So we appreciate that leadership.
[01:35:53.868 --> 01:36:03.013]  Well, break down what your organization does and why you've started investigating the TSA stand down A, but you're going further than that.
[01:36:03.013 --> 01:36:12.279]  You're also burrowing in to this reported TSA memo, calling people domestic extremists who don't like having the government put their hands down their pants.
[01:36:13.598 --> 01:36:14.418]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:36:14.418 --> 01:36:20.660]  Liberty Guard and, again, our chairman Bob Barr and myself and others put together a Liberty Guard.
[01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:29.703]  It's a group that's really committed to protecting individual liberties and freedoms and certainly using the Constitution as our focal point.
[01:36:29.703 --> 01:36:35.244]  And we just saw this and it was one of these gut reactions where everyone said, this is wrong.
[01:36:35.244 --> 01:36:38.085]  And I think we've all been wondering at what point does
[01:36:39.031 --> 01:36:42.653]  Do everyday Americans decide to stand up for their liberties and say enough is enough?
[01:36:42.653 --> 01:36:47.435]  And I think it's probably right when the government bureaucrats begin to grab for our junk, if you will.
[01:36:47.435 --> 01:36:50.576]  I think people all over the country are outraged.
[01:36:50.576 --> 01:37:02.182]  They've looked at these incidences where children and women that have had mastectomies and men that have various issues with bladder control and so on are really being humiliated.
[01:37:02.182 --> 01:37:08.765]  And there's a serious question as to whether this is at all effective.
[01:37:09.412 --> 01:37:23.180]  And there's a serious constitutional question, and so we basically said, you know, let's create this opt-out alliance.com, which we did, and let folks know what they could do to resist this.
[01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:36.028]  And then, lo and behold, there was all this groundswell and grassroots excitement, internet excitement, and people were geared up, in effect, to question some of this.
[01:37:36.889 --> 01:37:41.872]  And the TSA looks as if they basically shut down many of these machines.
[01:37:41.872 --> 01:37:45.374]  And we're asking the question, why is that?
[01:37:45.374 --> 01:37:54.020]  I mean, was it that that particular day, Thanksgiving, they deemed was a, they were confident there wasn't going to be no terrorism on that day?
[01:37:54.020 --> 01:37:57.602]  I mean, if these machines are still effective, they better have them on all the time.
[01:37:57.602 --> 01:38:02.365]  Or was it that they really wanted to kind of quell the national
[01:38:08.542 --> 01:38:09.642]  And they wanted to go further.
[01:38:09.642 --> 01:38:16.064]  They wanted to then falsely run the hoax, and we know they did do this, saying, no one protested, everyone loves it.
[01:38:16.064 --> 01:38:18.904]  This turned into National Appreciation Day.
[01:38:18.904 --> 01:38:24.485]  I mean, so they're involved in multi-deceptions, but looking at this, I mean, it's got to be illegal.
[01:38:24.485 --> 01:38:28.026]  If they're saying, sorry, got to remove that piercing, sorry.
[01:38:28.886 --> 01:38:31.166]  Got to put my hands down your baggy pants.
[01:38:31.166 --> 01:38:32.887]  Sorry, got a naked body scan.
[01:38:32.887 --> 01:38:35.047]  They lied about not saving the images.
[01:38:35.047 --> 01:38:42.929]  And then they claim Al-Qaeda is such an imminent threat that they've got to remove people's colostomy bags, you name it.
[01:38:42.929 --> 01:38:51.551]  All of this is happening, but then they totally stand down the day before Thanksgiving, stand down on Thanksgiving, and the day after, because the new protesters will be flying back home.
[01:38:51.551 --> 01:38:55.551]  Our intel is this went on for about three days, and then now it's back.
[01:38:55.551 --> 01:38:56.852]  I mean, this is asinine.
[01:38:56.852 --> 01:38:57.732]  And then Ron Paul,
[01:38:58.112 --> 01:38:59.253]  They grab his crotch.
[01:38:59.253 --> 01:39:01.694]  Jesse Ventura, they grab his crotch.
[01:39:01.694 --> 01:39:02.994]  They don't want to fly.
[01:39:02.994 --> 01:39:05.476]  But then we have Congressman Boehner.
[01:39:05.476 --> 01:39:06.856]  He gets to walk around.
[01:39:06.856 --> 01:39:08.437]  The cabinet gets to walk around.
[01:39:08.437 --> 01:39:11.298]  I mean, this is serious discrimination as well.
[01:39:11.298 --> 01:39:14.140]  This is selective enforcement on multi-fronts.
[01:39:15.154 --> 01:39:16.476]  Well, no question.
[01:39:16.476 --> 01:39:18.678]  And, I mean, this is going to have to be for everybody.
[01:39:18.678 --> 01:39:21.281]  I mean, we're all going to have to have our crotches grabbed.
[01:39:21.281 --> 01:39:27.749]  I think that's got to be a 100% across the board, and it should start, certainly, with our president and all of Congress and all.
[01:39:27.749 --> 01:39:31.152]  Everybody's got to understand and experience that, which I have done, by the way.
[01:39:31.152 --> 01:39:35.017]  I flew recently and had that uniquely interesting experience.
[01:39:36.841 --> 01:39:38.862]  Absolutely, it has to be across the board.
[01:39:38.862 --> 01:39:44.564]  If indeed the TSA did this for political reasons, I think that's a real serious question.
[01:39:44.564 --> 01:39:53.087]  And even more, even as interesting, if the mainstream media is in any way complicit in this, I think there ought to be some real questions asked about that.
[01:39:53.087 --> 01:39:56.968]  Because you're right, they're trying to make it out as TSA Appreciation Day.
[01:39:56.968 --> 01:39:58.989]  Jeez, everyday Americans don't care about this.
[01:39:58.989 --> 01:40:00.609]  Well, they do.
[01:40:00.609 --> 01:40:05.931]  And did they take action to really quell what was a legitimate public... I'm sorry,
[01:40:07.230 --> 01:40:09.131]  Now let's talk about this card you've got.
[01:40:09.131 --> 01:40:11.371]  It's good to show solidarity.
[01:40:11.371 --> 01:40:16.432]  I pointed this out a month ago, now even the New York Times admits this is like Tea Party 2.0.
[01:40:16.432 --> 01:40:32.737]  This is a focal point for outrage, a coming together that is trans-partisan, that is across the political spectrum, and almost every major national poll shows over 60 percent, some in Reuters 96 percent, against what's happening.
[01:40:33.397 --> 01:40:42.722]  And the TSA just brazenly says, no, everyone loves it, and by the way, we'll give you an $11,000 fine even if you want to leave the airport.
[01:40:42.722 --> 01:40:44.943]  We've got to squeeze your junk.
[01:40:44.943 --> 01:40:50.946]  Then they go on and admit, they told Atlantic Monthly and others, we are squeezing you to intimidate you into the machines.
[01:40:50.946 --> 01:41:00.151]  Then we have D'Amato and we have Chertoff and all these other people, formerly in government, now in the companies making money.
[01:41:00.151 --> 01:41:01.732]  I mean, this thing is dirty from A to Z.
[01:41:03.244 --> 01:41:04.504]  It absolutely is.
[01:41:04.504 --> 01:41:10.606]  And I think the American people have been, you know, I think that the pretense is over.
[01:41:10.606 --> 01:41:14.046]  I think they understand that the government now is in many ways self-serving.
[01:41:14.046 --> 01:41:20.128]  Self-serving meaning self-serving itself, self-serving its bureaucrats and its special interests.
[01:41:20.128 --> 01:41:25.169]  And the people that are getting the absolute raw, frighteningly raw on the stick are everyday Americans.
[01:41:26.841 --> 01:41:39.395]  And if you will, and I believe you used this word, I think it's time for the resistance, and that means pretty much every damn American, to kind of begin to stand up and say there are lines that are drawn, and we're not going any further.
[01:41:39.395 --> 01:41:46.322]  And, you know, we have constitutional rights, and that works for us, and we're tired of believing them.
[01:41:47.392 --> 01:41:55.178]  All right, Joe Seehusen, President and CEO of LibertyGuard, founded and headed up, of course, by former Congressman Bob Barr.
[01:41:55.178 --> 01:41:56.579]  Again, let's get into this card.
[01:41:56.579 --> 01:41:58.681]  How do folks get involved with your organization?
[01:41:58.681 --> 01:41:59.721]  How do they get the card?
[01:41:59.721 --> 01:42:01.503]  Because people are like, well, so what a card?
[01:42:01.503 --> 01:42:04.305]  The point is, it's like having an ACLU card.
[01:42:04.705 --> 01:42:12.168]  Easy as the best way, just go to libertyguard.org, libertyguard.org, and right at the top of that is how to get the Opt Out Alliance.
[01:42:30.462 --> 01:42:31.142]  We're good to go.
[01:42:48.152 --> 01:42:58.658]  I think it's prudent for all of us to understand that if we challenge it, the TSA is kind of in the business of making life challenging for those who challenge it.
[01:42:58.658 --> 01:43:06.742]  And so I think people would have to make an individual decision if they wanted to do that, because it could be uncomfortable, it could delay them an hour or two or more.
[01:43:07.898 --> 01:43:26.490]  So I think people want to think through that, but the folks who want to say, hey, I'm challenging it, and here's some steps that I'm willing to take, and or I'd show them, hey, by the way, I'm not sure, here's my Op-Ed Alliance card from Liberty Guard, and pay attention, because everyday folks are really starting to draw the line what to put up with.
[01:43:26.874 --> 01:43:27.074]  That's
[01:43:40.939 --> 01:43:57.091]  If we put up with anything, more and more corrupt people will gravitate into government to get that petty power to be able to abuse people, like the private Federal Reserve has now come out giving over a trillion to private corporations, not just banks, including MSNBC.
[01:43:57.091 --> 01:44:00.433]  They won't tell us where 885 billion more of it went.
[01:44:00.433 --> 01:44:01.794]  That's Bloomberg today.
[01:44:01.794 --> 01:44:06.118]  I mean, we've got to really come to grips with the fact that we're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:44:06.758 --> 01:44:10.242]  The corruption is, it's like, it's like blood poisoning.
[01:44:10.242 --> 01:44:18.051]  We have got to get this infection under control or bye-bye America, bye-bye Republican on this TSA front.
[01:44:18.051 --> 01:44:21.094]  They admit they want to be on the streets of America with Viper teams.
[01:44:21.094 --> 01:44:26.800]  They have said, both Pistol, the head of the TSA, and Napolitano, the head of Homeland Security, that they want
[01:44:27.793 --> 01:44:29.715]  They have TSA in every community.
[01:44:29.715 --> 01:44:36.643]  Literal minimum wage goons with unlimited above the law power running around doing this.
[01:44:36.643 --> 01:44:38.084]  This is a Tenth Amendment issue.
[01:44:38.084 --> 01:44:40.687]  They're harassing people with disabilities.
[01:44:40.687 --> 01:44:40.907]  It's a...
[01:44:42.216 --> 01:44:44.737]  Major issue there.
[01:44:44.737 --> 01:44:46.638]  And this is the big fight.
[01:44:46.638 --> 01:44:48.059]  Bullies always push, push, push.
[01:44:48.059 --> 01:44:49.220]  Now we're pushing back.
[01:44:49.220 --> 01:44:50.820]  They're kind of standing down.
[01:44:50.820 --> 01:44:57.224]  Pistol came out yesterday and said, well, we'll just have a no-fly for everybody unless we say you're authorized.
[01:44:57.224 --> 01:44:58.604]  And so they're expanding that.
[01:44:58.604 --> 01:45:01.306]  The White House wants a no-fly, no-gun-by.
[01:45:01.306 --> 01:45:05.968]  So we're really seeing this as an internal, checkpoint, federal, brownshirt system.
[01:45:05.968 --> 01:45:07.629]  Your views on those statements?
[01:45:08.729 --> 01:45:12.676]  I think you're hitting on some fascinating, critically important points.
[01:45:12.676 --> 01:45:18.966]  I mean, intentionally or unintentionally, you know, the government and the bureaucrats are basically saying
[01:45:20.197 --> 01:45:24.442]  Um, by virtue of their actions, the American people, what will you put up with?
[01:45:24.442 --> 01:45:26.705]  You know, will you put up with being groped?
[01:45:26.705 --> 01:45:32.071]  Will you be forced to take out prosthetic advice for a woman who's lost the breast through cancer?
[01:45:32.071 --> 01:45:35.736]  What will you put up with?
[01:45:35.736 --> 01:45:39.300]  Well, it's a power grab, Alex, you're right, and it's also, you know, part of the test.
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:40.260]  Yes.
[01:45:40.260 --> 01:45:46.943]  You know, and part of it may be, again, there may be, you know, kind of nefarious folks conspiring.
[01:45:46.943 --> 01:45:48.324]  You know, that's certainly a possibility.
[01:45:48.324 --> 01:45:59.428]  The other possibility is they've just got way too much money, way too much big budgets, and they sit around at high-paid jobs and dream up ways to expand their empire.
[01:45:59.428 --> 01:46:03.210]  And for the TSA and Homeland Security at all, part of it is... So mission creep.
[01:46:03.210 --> 01:46:05.431]  This is more like mission warp speed.
[01:46:06.634 --> 01:46:08.817]  Is Mission Creep Warp Speed?
[01:46:08.817 --> 01:46:10.199]  Well said.
[01:46:10.199 --> 01:46:20.892]  And I think one of the things we'd like to do at Liberty Guard and the Offset Alliance is to get this ball rolling with the TSA groping and get, again, everyday Americans.
[01:46:20.892 --> 01:46:21.813]  This is not just a
[01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:24.702]  A handful of freedom fighters.
[01:46:24.702 --> 01:46:27.345]  Americans have to become a nation of freedom fighters.
[01:46:27.345 --> 01:46:31.029]  And through your excellent work, Alex, a lot of that is happening.
[01:46:31.029 --> 01:46:35.313]  And basically have to say, you know, we're going to push back on the groping thing.
[01:46:35.313 --> 01:46:37.795]  Our genitals are the line in the sand.
[01:46:39.037 --> 01:46:45.501]  And then they're hopefully going to begin to say, now that we look at this, are there other things that are being done by our government?
[01:46:45.501 --> 01:46:48.483]  And again, some of it Republican, some of it Democrat.
[01:46:48.483 --> 01:46:50.965]  We're a non-partisan, non-profit group.
[01:46:50.965 --> 01:47:01.273]  We're here to protect civil liberties and the Constitution and our Bill of Rights, and have everyday Americans begin to question, you know, what other programs are in place that are inappropriate?
[01:47:03.154 --> 01:47:11.257]  Well, I like what you're doing, though, because the ACLU model is that if it's kind of a liberal or socialistic thing, they'll defend it.
[01:47:11.257 --> 01:47:14.158]  If it's seen as conservative rights, they won't.
[01:47:14.158 --> 01:47:15.859]  And I'm not saying I'm totally against them.
[01:47:15.859 --> 01:47:18.320]  They've done some good things on occasion.
[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:24.162]  But it's always about you go file a complaint with them, and they're this Valhalla
[01:47:24.922 --> 01:47:34.387]  You know, up on the hill, or like in the Greek mythology, you know, the Greek gods up on Mount Olympus.
[01:47:34.387 --> 01:47:38.189]  I like the fact that you're saying, look, we don't want you behind Liberty Guard.
[01:47:38.189 --> 01:47:40.290]  We want you right beside Liberty Guard.
[01:47:40.290 --> 01:47:42.571]  This is a participation sport.
[01:47:42.571 --> 01:47:48.795]  Liberty is a participation sport, and we're here to advise you on how to go out and say no.
[01:47:48.795 --> 01:47:51.236]  And I like the slogan, every day is an opt-out day.
[01:47:52.157 --> 01:47:54.297]  Every day is an opt-out day, and you're absolutely right.
[01:47:54.297 --> 01:47:56.838]  And we are certainly, again, nonpartisan.
[01:47:56.838 --> 01:48:01.299]  We like and dislike Republicans just as much as we like and dislike Democrats.
[01:48:01.299 --> 01:48:11.900]  But we want to work with the whole spectrum of Americans who love freedom, you and other folks on radio and television, some real fine groups out there doing work.
[01:48:11.900 --> 01:48:13.961]  And we say, hey, we want to be part of it.
[01:48:13.961 --> 01:48:16.241]  We want to make our contribution.
[01:48:16.241 --> 01:48:19.682]  But this has to be a national movement every day.
[01:48:19.682 --> 01:48:20.562]  It's an opt-out day.
[01:48:21.323 --> 01:48:34.884]  And this is really about finding the depths of what Americans will put up with in terms of the profligate kind of spending that government's doing, the debt, various questionable war activity overseas.
[01:48:36.370 --> 01:48:43.892]  Just despicable kind of touching, patting down in the name of civil liberties.
[01:48:43.892 --> 01:48:46.213]  What about federal grants for DWI?
[01:48:46.213 --> 01:48:49.254]  I'm sorry to interrupt, but what about federal grants?
[01:48:49.254 --> 01:48:58.276]  Here in Austin they have federal grants for warrantless checkpoints where cops in the dead of night take your blood and it's federal.
[01:48:58.276 --> 01:49:03.898]  What is the federal government doing funding local police to be scurrying around like Nosferatu?
[01:49:05.054 --> 01:49:25.463]  Right, and the amazing thing is, with what, a three-plus trillion dollar budget and the innumerable line items on that, Alex, that go down to every state, county, and municipality, we've got to have a consortium of freedom fighters, yourself, other good folks, Liberty Guard, and other good groups, and everyday Americans.
[01:49:26.391 --> 01:49:29.674]  I'm saying, you know, we'd rather not get involved.
[01:49:29.674 --> 01:49:35.018]  None of us really want to kind of get involved, because we've got other things maybe we'd like to do, like enjoy freedom.
[01:49:35.018 --> 01:49:48.589]  But every generation, or really now, every century, Americans have to stand up in unison, lock arms, and say, we are here to defend this country, and we are here to defend our constitutional civil liberties, and we're here to tell politicians there's a limit.
[01:49:48.829 --> 01:49:53.833]  Yeah, now it's come to putting us in radiation chambers and sticking their hands down our pants.
[01:49:53.833 --> 01:50:00.397]  And just a month ago when I was telling people about this, they didn't believe me, and TSA came out and said, yeah, we stick our hands down your pants.
[01:50:00.397 --> 01:50:03.980]  Briefly, Bob Barr, your chairman, what's his view on this?
[01:50:03.980 --> 01:50:06.281]  Ron Paul said that he got groped.
[01:50:06.281 --> 01:50:10.725]  Jesse Ventura said he got groped on the genitals here.
[01:50:10.725 --> 01:50:13.026]  You said similar things have happened to you.
[01:50:14.367 --> 01:50:19.533]  I went through the process and the meaning is not the word to describe it.
[01:50:19.533 --> 01:50:21.535]  I believe our chairman Bob Barr has been through it.
[01:50:22.265 --> 01:50:28.130]  And clearly, Bob Barr has been, in so many ways, a champion of civil liberties and privacy rights.
[01:50:28.130 --> 01:50:32.513]  And I know this particular issue really sticks in his claw, understandably.
[01:50:32.513 --> 01:50:33.094]  Well, stay there!
[01:50:33.094 --> 01:50:34.395]  Tell us about that after the break.
[01:50:34.395 --> 01:50:36.436]  Joe C. Huson is our guest.
[01:50:36.436 --> 01:50:40.420]  He's the President and CEO of LibertyGuard, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:40.420 --> 01:50:41.901]  The website's LibertyGuard.org.
[01:50:41.901 --> 01:50:46.765]  And if you're watching us on PrisonPlanet.tv, not just listening on the radio,
[01:50:47.285 --> 01:50:49.470]  We're going to put it up on screen as we go to break.
[01:50:49.470 --> 01:50:53.779]  That's LibertyGuard.org, our sites InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:50:53.779 --> 01:50:54.281]  Stay with us.
[01:50:54.281 --> 01:50:55.944]  Final segment with our guest straight ahead.
[01:50:55.944 --> 01:50:56.325]  Stay with us.
[01:51:01.035 --> 01:51:02.336]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.336 --> 01:51:07.941]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.941 --> 01:51:12.946]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.946 --> 01:51:13.427]  It's true.
[01:51:13.427 --> 01:51:17.991]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:18.511 --> 01:51:23.736]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.736 --> 01:51:30.863]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.863 --> 01:51:31.984]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:31.984 --> 01:51:38.350]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[01:51:45.116 --> 01:51:48.659]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:48.659 --> 01:51:50.381]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[01:52:49.028 --> 01:52:49.349]  We're good.
[01:53:00.259 --> 01:53:05.482]  How well and how fast does heart and body extract work to improve blood circulation?
[01:53:05.482 --> 01:53:06.182]  Listen.
[01:53:06.182 --> 01:53:10.444]  My name is Ellis and I'm 66 years old and I live in Jacksonville, Florida.
[01:53:10.444 --> 01:53:13.846]  Two years ago I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries.
[01:53:13.846 --> 01:53:16.887]  I had 70% blockage in one artery leading to my heart.
[01:53:16.887 --> 01:53:20.249]  They wanted me to go on Plavix but I refused knowing the negative side effects.
[01:53:20.666 --> 01:53:29.069]  Heart and Body Extract is a unique balance, synergy and proportion of herbs reaching from head to toe at maximum absorption around 95% at the cellular level.
[01:53:29.069 --> 01:53:31.630]  Within the first month I felt a dramatic difference.
[01:53:31.630 --> 01:53:35.992]  The heaviness in my legs was reduced and within two months I felt completely normal.
[01:53:36.232 --> 01:53:40.434]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is Heart and Body Extract.
[01:53:40.434 --> 01:53:44.636]  Heart and Body Extract comes with a 100% ironclad money-back guarantee.

[01:54:04.384 --> 01:54:10.570]  We're coming for you, TSA, the would-be minimum-wage federal brown shirts.
[01:54:10.570 --> 01:54:14.054]  You know what happens to the brown shirts if the real tyranny takes over?
[01:54:14.054 --> 01:54:18.037]  It'll be night of the long knives, and not at our hands, but at the hands of Big Brother.
[01:54:18.037 --> 01:54:20.240]  Boy, I tell you, humans just repeat history.
[01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:24.522]  You know, Joe Seehusen is just a great guy.
[01:54:24.522 --> 01:54:32.425]  I should add that he was the National Deputy Campaign Director, so the number three guy in Ron Paul's presidential run in 2008.
[01:54:32.425 --> 01:54:45.351]  I should also add that he was the former National Director of the Libertarian Party, and now he's the President and CEO of Liberty Guard, and the chairman of that is Congressman Bob Barr, and he's going to twist Bob Barr's arm and try to get him on with us in the next few weeks.
[01:54:46.491 --> 01:54:49.333]  We talked so much during the break, Joe, I think we may have forgotten.
[01:54:49.333 --> 01:54:51.134]  What was it, the story you were telling?
[01:54:51.134 --> 01:54:59.739]  Oh yeah, it was Bob Barr's view and position, and you said he was particularly outraged on the groping.
[01:54:59.739 --> 01:55:15.709]  Well, absolutely, and Congressman Barr has been a champion of civil liberties and the Constitution, and has that background, has been fighting that fight for a long time, and just watching the steady decline in our civil liberties, and I think when he saw this,
[01:55:16.804 --> 01:55:24.306]  And saw the demeaning component of it, and the questionable constitutional nature of it, and the questionable efficacy of it.
[01:55:24.306 --> 01:55:27.107]  He just said, hey, we've got to do this here at LibertyGuard.org.
[01:55:27.107 --> 01:55:28.928]  And we all said, absolutely.
[01:55:28.928 --> 01:55:37.691]  And that's really the impetus of it, is his leadership on that one, and saying, hey, we've got to understand everyday Americans are going to draw a line.
[01:55:37.691 --> 01:55:39.851]  And the line is, you can't do this to us.
[01:55:39.851 --> 01:55:41.852]  You can't do this to our kids.
[01:55:41.852 --> 01:55:43.333]  You can't do this to our nuns.
[01:55:45.194 --> 01:55:46.915]  Well, I mean, if the federal government can have
[01:56:06.687 --> 01:56:18.214]  Really untrained people just running around doing whatever they want and saying that they're above the law and shouting at people and screaming opt-out.
[01:56:18.214 --> 01:56:19.355]  The sky's the limit, Joe!
[01:56:21.055 --> 01:56:22.196]  Well, that's certainly a concern.
[01:56:22.196 --> 01:56:37.584]  And again, when people do join the Op-Ed Alliance, when they sign up and get that card of what we believe that our research has shown are legitimate options that a person could take, we want to make sure they understand that that's an individual decision and it may be an uncomfortable one for them.
[01:56:37.584 --> 01:56:38.704]  They may miss their flight.
[01:56:38.704 --> 01:56:42.987]  They may go through more procedures, more questions, if you will, to kind of
[01:56:44.281 --> 01:56:52.783]  You know, thoughtless, really intimidation of the TSA agents that may not know their boundaries.
[01:56:52.783 --> 01:57:01.886]  But it's one of those things where people who believe this is an important statement to make, many have done it already, are going to do it and question it.
[01:57:01.886 --> 01:57:04.147]  And we're doing it in a thoughtful way.
[01:57:04.147 --> 01:57:06.027]  We're asking basic questions.
[01:57:06.027 --> 01:57:07.328]  Is this constitutional?
[01:57:07.328 --> 01:57:08.968]  Is this effective?
[01:57:08.968 --> 01:57:11.629]  And my gosh, can't we protect our nation from terrorists?
[01:57:12.324 --> 01:57:15.446]  Without demeaning everyday Americans.
[01:57:15.446 --> 01:57:17.847]  I think those are some pretty fundamental questions.
[01:57:17.847 --> 01:57:38.017]  Well, and even more than that, Joe, in closing, I saw an NBC article two weeks ago where they admit that every week hundreds, and overall thousands every year, of boats land in San Diego with illegal aliens from all over the world that go to Mexico to then be brought into the U.S.
[01:57:38.017 --> 01:57:41.579]  and there's no Border Patrol, no police, no TSA,
[01:57:42.399 --> 01:57:48.565]  It came out in ABC News, illegal aliens can literally go in and rent aircraft and TSA just gives them waivers.
[01:57:48.565 --> 01:57:54.069]  Fox News reported and it was confirmed they hired illegal aliens to build part of the show fence.
[01:57:54.069 --> 01:57:57.272]  I mean, the government could care less about our so-called security.
[01:57:57.272 --> 01:58:02.257]  28,000 dead in the last two years on the Mexico-US border.
[01:58:02.257 --> 01:58:04.579]  And that's more than the Vietnam War every year.
[01:58:04.579 --> 01:58:06.981]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:58:06.981 --> 01:58:08.122]  Your final comment on that?
[01:58:08.582 --> 01:58:36.689]  Well, part of this is, again, this scope creep that you mentioned, where these bureaucracies have big budgets, they have people who are, you know, questionably not fully trained, not fully conversant with the laws, potentially, and they basically kind of begin to, you know, make up the law kind of on the spot, you know, again, intentionally or unintentionally, and that's where a lot of the danger comes in, and I think challenging them, challenging what they're doing, challenging their budgets,
[01:58:37.569 --> 01:58:38.450]  Joe, great job.
[01:58:38.450 --> 01:58:39.232]  We're out of time.
[01:58:39.232 --> 01:58:43.377]  God bless you.
[01:58:43.377 --> 01:58:46.802]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.802 --> 01:58:49.004]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.759 --> 01:58:55.323]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:55.323 --> 01:58:56.243]  Number 1.
[01:58:56.243 --> 01:58:59.666]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:59.666 --> 01:59:00.527]  Number 2.
[01:59:00.527 --> 01:59:05.410]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:05.410 --> 01:59:06.151]  It's true.
[01:59:06.151 --> 01:59:11.035]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:11.035 --> 01:59:11.855]  Number 3.
[01:59:11.855 --> 01:59:15.438]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:15.438 --> 01:59:19.141]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:19.341 --> 01:59:20.142]  Number 4.
[01:59:20.142 --> 01:59:22.904]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:22.904 --> 01:59:26.587]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:26.587 --> 01:59:27.368]  Number 5.
[01:59:27.368 --> 01:59:31.512]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:31.512 --> 01:59:36.276]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:36.576 --> 01:59:40.738]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:40.738 --> 01:59:42.519]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:42.519 --> 01:59:44.780]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:59:44.780 --> 01:59:47.382]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:59:47.382 --> 01:59:48.762]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:48.762 --> 01:59:54.605]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:10.383]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.383 --> 02:00:11.964]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.964 --> 02:00:13.505]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.505 --> 02:00:17.707]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.707 --> 02:00:21.769]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.950 --> 02:00:30.315]  We've got really big news dealing with what's happening with our water.
[02:00:30.315 --> 02:00:38.485]  The globalists aren't just power-grabbing our infrastructure, our highways, bankrupting our states and counties, raising our taxes.
[02:00:39.696 --> 02:00:39.936]  Yeah.
[02:01:09.449 --> 02:01:10.471]  We're good to go.
[02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:33.006]  We've got the Alex Jones Essential Collection, five of my best-selling, most informative films for $25, $24.95.
[02:01:33.006 --> 02:01:35.708]  That's less than $5 a piece.
[02:01:35.708 --> 02:01:37.690]  That's running until Christmas.
[02:01:37.690 --> 02:01:40.153]  That's up on Infowars.com right now.
[02:01:40.153 --> 02:01:42.074]  People are really taking advantage of that.
[02:01:42.074 --> 02:01:43.576]  Get it, get it out to everybody you know.
[02:01:43.576 --> 02:01:50.622]  Instead of giving them a tie or a fruitcake, you know, spend four bucks and change and give them a powerful film in the hardcover case.
[02:01:51.243 --> 02:01:56.127]  We've got a lot of other great books and videos we've added, like They Own It All, including you.
[02:01:56.127 --> 02:01:58.008]  That's a great book folks kept telling me about.
[02:01:58.008 --> 02:01:59.509]  That's discounted at Infowars.com.
[02:01:59.509 --> 02:02:04.813]  We've got a bunch of other specials on t-shirts, you name it, at Infowars.com.
[02:02:04.813 --> 02:02:06.594]  Also, we do this every year.
[02:02:06.594 --> 02:02:09.897]  Seventh year anniversary coming up next year in April.
[02:02:09.897 --> 02:02:12.078]  So this will be the seventh time we've done it, or the sixth time.
[02:02:12.078 --> 02:02:13.219]  I guess next year will be the seventh time.
[02:02:14.660 --> 02:02:15.061]  We're good to go.
[02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:39.481]  Video archive of the show.
[02:02:39.481 --> 02:02:41.721]  Watch the live show simulcast with radio.

[02:02:47.883 --> 02:02:49.404]  We've added a whole bunch of interviews.
[02:02:49.404 --> 02:02:51.645]  Like six or seven of them in the last week.
[02:02:51.645 --> 02:02:55.086]  Exclusive interviews where we flew places and interviewed folks like Dr. Blaylock.
[02:02:55.666 --> 02:02:57.769]  Or Dr. Childers.
[02:02:57.769 --> 02:02:59.832]  Or one of my speeches in Santa Cruz.
[02:02:59.832 --> 02:03:03.016]  The second one's going up next week.
[02:03:03.016 --> 02:03:04.478]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:03:04.478 --> 02:03:06.921]  And your funding of us makes it all possible.
[02:03:06.921 --> 02:03:10.205]  Also, our sponsors, like a Cola Blue.
[02:03:10.205 --> 02:03:12.468]  The Atmospheric Water Generator.
[02:03:13.220 --> 02:03:15.782]  Looks like a high-tech water cooler without the water bottle.
[02:03:15.782 --> 02:03:17.403]  It's like Robbie the Robot.
[02:03:17.403 --> 02:03:18.603]  Grabs water out of the air.
[02:03:18.603 --> 02:03:22.366]  The purest, cleanest drinking water you're going to find anywhere.
[02:03:22.366 --> 02:03:23.366]  Super high quality.
[02:03:23.366 --> 02:03:24.127]  Ecolablue.com.

[02:03:24.687 --> 02:03:24.807]  Or 800-691-6043.
[02:03:24.807 --> 02:03:24.907]  800-691-6043.
[02:03:24.907 --> 02:03:26.268]  The atmospheric water generator.
[02:03:26.268 --> 02:03:27.789]  They got a whole bunch of different units.
[02:03:34.673 --> 02:03:34.873]  I don't
[02:03:55.700 --> 02:03:56.761]  We're good to go!
[02:04:24.799 --> 02:04:32.704]  I'll hit this briefly when we come back.
[02:04:32.704 --> 02:04:36.646]  We're getting Michael Braverman on right now.
[02:04:36.646 --> 02:04:41.289]  And of course that's out of roll call.
[02:04:41.289 --> 02:04:42.990]  That is not a Senate error!
[02:04:42.990 --> 02:04:44.711]  They've known since the founding of the country.
[02:04:46.153 --> 02:04:49.996]  Since 1789 when we officially got to Congress, not the Continental Congress, but the U.S.
[02:04:49.996 --> 02:04:57.422]  Congress, that spending bills have to originate in the House of Representatives.
[02:04:57.422 --> 02:04:58.523]  It's not an error.
[02:04:58.523 --> 02:04:59.944]  They're a bunch of criminal tyrants.
[02:05:01.769 --> 02:05:17.243]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:05:17.243 --> 02:05:20.926]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:21.929 --> 02:05:34.699]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:05:34.699 --> 02:05:41.965]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:05:42.645 --> 02:05:53.011]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.

[02:06:00.782 --> 02:06:04.985]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:06:04.985 --> 02:06:11.390]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:06:11.390 --> 02:06:18.796]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:06:18.796 --> 02:06:23.660]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:06:30.225 --> 02:06:32.345]  People keep asking me, how's business?
[02:06:32.345 --> 02:06:35.006]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:06:35.006 --> 02:06:35.146]  Call us.
[02:06:48.090 --> 02:06:48.371]  At 1-800-340-7091.

[02:06:55.601 --> 02:06:58.665]  You may be arrested and your subject.
[02:07:04.673 --> 02:07:05.934]  Tyranny is here.
[02:07:05.934 --> 02:07:09.878]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:07:09.878 --> 02:07:12.101]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:07:12.101 --> 02:07:17.987]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[02:07:17.987 --> 02:07:24.234]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:07:24.634 --> 02:07:30.616]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:07:30.616 --> 02:07:34.797]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:07:34.797 --> 02:07:39.078]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:07:39.078 --> 02:07:45.040]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:07:45.040 --> 02:07:48.581]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:07:48.581 --> 02:07:50.562]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:07:50.562 --> 02:07:51.002]  It's here.

[02:08:10.519 --> 02:08:12.100]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.100 --> 02:08:13.640]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.640 --> 02:08:17.842]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.842 --> 02:08:24.885]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:24.885 --> 02:08:32.209]  Alright, I want everyone to focus on what we're about to cover right now.
[02:08:32.209 --> 02:08:34.730]  In fact, we're gonna search this and put it on screen for you.
[02:08:36.300 --> 02:08:40.423]  Radioactive isotopes covered up in Texas water.
[02:08:40.423 --> 02:08:54.353]  Remember two weeks ago it came out in the Houston Chronicle, CBS News, that they were finding uranium in most Texas water supplies that isn't even in the groundwater, and that the feds had been covering it up with the state.
[02:08:54.353 --> 02:09:02.979]  Now, I pointed out that uranium is in the phosphate deposits where they're mining the sodium fluoride.
[02:09:02.979 --> 02:09:05.501]  Now, Jesse Ventura, an American
[02:09:06.627 --> 02:09:14.330]  A conspiracy author, researcher, with his TV show, Conspiracy Theory, went out and talked to the experts.
[02:09:14.330 --> 02:09:17.352]  I'm in tonight's episode, but they talked to radiation experts, you name it.
[02:09:17.352 --> 02:09:22.354]  Fertility in males is dropping worldwide, especially in the West.
[02:09:24.585 --> 02:09:26.546]  This episode is off the charts.
[02:09:26.546 --> 02:09:28.907]  It is super hardcore.
[02:09:28.907 --> 02:09:36.811]  And we have got to get not just the sodium fluoride out, because they brainwash people that's good for them, even though top scientists in the EPA admit it's not.
[02:09:36.811 --> 02:09:40.753]  Now they're going to try to say uranium's good for you.
[02:09:40.753 --> 02:09:42.834]  Now right where I live, there's uranium in the water.
[02:09:44.159 --> 02:09:50.101]  And the hippies will get mad if you cut a tree down to build a shed, but they're like, give me uranium, I want it.
[02:09:50.101 --> 02:09:51.682]  I mean, this is eugenics.
[02:09:51.682 --> 02:09:55.923]  This is population reduction, and it's gonna air tomorrow night.
[02:09:55.923 --> 02:09:58.984]  And it just makes me so angry, folks, that this is going on.
[02:09:58.984 --> 02:10:07.887]  Michael Braverman, executive producer, he's produced many national television programs, and of course, he also helped produce Jesse Ventura's TV show on MSNBC.
[02:10:09.736 --> 02:10:12.999]  And he's produced a television program for CBS primetime television.
[02:10:12.999 --> 02:10:17.162]  I'm not going to go through it all, but he's produced shows for A&E.
[02:10:17.162 --> 02:10:23.408]  But Michael Braverman joins us now to give you a sneak peek into what they discovered.
[02:10:23.408 --> 02:10:29.233]  This all started out just to look into foreign corporations stealing water and gobbling it up to jack up prices.
[02:10:29.233 --> 02:10:30.274]  IMF World Bank documents.
[02:10:31.465 --> 02:10:40.229]  They came to interview me in Austin, and that's the turning point in the show, and they went and looked up the stuff I told them about, and actually, then the whole show turned out to be different.
[02:10:40.229 --> 02:10:45.951]  And folks, it's bombshell, and it's hidden in plain view, and it's going to air for the first time tomorrow night on TV, 9 p.m.
[02:10:45.951 --> 02:10:47.132]  Central, 10 p.m.
[02:10:47.132 --> 02:10:48.092]  Eastern.
[02:10:48.092 --> 02:10:50.053]  Michael Braverman, great to have you here with us.
[02:10:50.053 --> 02:10:51.554]  Hey, Alex, thanks for having me on again.
[02:10:52.094 --> 02:10:53.696]  You bet, my friend.
[02:10:53.696 --> 02:10:59.381]  Look, you've dropped such... Seriously, folks, I thought I was freaked out by the FEMA camp special.
[02:10:59.381 --> 02:11:10.572]  Now I am really freaked out because I know everything you just told me is confirmed and what's in the show, but just to know they've been doing it and getting away with it, they're putting uranium in on purpose.
[02:11:10.572 --> 02:11:11.953]  That's only one part of the show.
[02:11:11.953 --> 02:11:15.357]  Michael, tell us as much as you can about the premiere tomorrow night.
[02:11:15.865 --> 02:11:19.726]  Well, you know, Alex, it's one of those things that's pretty similar to what we talked about two weeks ago.
[02:11:19.726 --> 02:11:23.448]  You know, I come to this with sort of an open mind.
[02:11:23.448 --> 02:11:33.972]  I'm kind of agnostic about a lot of this stuff, because, you know, I sort of got into this, as you know, as a TV producer, and we started looking into this issue about water.
[02:11:33.972 --> 02:11:39.594]  Somebody said, y'all ought to look into this, because there's a lot of foreign companies
[02:11:40.454 --> 02:11:40.854]  It's massive.
[02:11:56.601 --> 02:12:06.324]  I'll start with one example, and by the way, anybody who's listened to this can just get on the computer and Google it, and you'll see that it's, as you say, right up there on plain sight.
[02:12:06.324 --> 02:12:11.466]  There's a place called Stanwood, Michigan, and I'm going to get to the uranium in a second, but I want to give you the backstory.
[02:12:11.466 --> 02:12:13.687]  I want to give your listeners the background of this.
[02:12:13.687 --> 02:12:15.707]  It's a place called Stanwood, Michigan.
[02:12:15.707 --> 02:12:16.808]  It's way up in the north.
[02:12:16.808 --> 02:12:18.288]  It's pretty rural.
[02:12:18.288 --> 02:12:19.489]  Actually, it's in the central part of the state.
[02:12:19.489 --> 02:12:20.189]  It's pretty rural.
[02:12:20.189 --> 02:12:23.070]  It's pretty depressed in terms of the economy.
[02:12:23.729 --> 02:12:38.400]  So Nestle Waters of America, which is a subsidiary of a giant multinational corporation called Nestle, which we've all heard of, built this big plant in Stanwood, Michigan, and they ain't making Nesquik.
[02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:49.168]  What they're doing is they're bottling water, which they're sucking up from Lake Michigan, and bottling it and selling it under the brand Ice Mountain, which you've probably all seen in the store.
[02:12:49.168 --> 02:12:49.389]  Okay.
[02:12:50.382 --> 02:12:59.175]  The state of Michigan leased them all of this water and leased them the land for the plant for, guess how much?
[02:12:59.175 --> 02:13:04.003]  I'll tell you, a hundred bucks a year under ex-Governor Angle's administration.
[02:13:04.003 --> 02:13:04.564]  A hundred bucks a year.
[02:13:05.436 --> 02:13:14.721]  So what Nestle did, being the smart corporation they are, is they didn't put their pumps on the shoreline of Lake Michigan, where everyone could see them and they'd be an eyesore and they'd attract a lot of attention.
[02:13:14.721 --> 02:13:15.121]  No.
[02:13:15.121 --> 02:13:30.789]  What they did is they put their massive pumps 12 miles inland on a private game preserve, where no one can see them, no one can hear them, and when you all watch the show tomorrow night, you'll see that we try to get in there, Jussie tries to get in there, and you can't get in it.
[02:13:31.744 --> 02:13:42.492]  And these huge pumps are sucking up thousands, millions, millions and millions of gallons of our water, America's water, good water, a year.
[02:13:42.492 --> 02:13:49.978]  And they're piping them to this big plant in Stanwood, Michigan, and the tankers go out every few minutes.
[02:13:49.978 --> 02:13:53.060]  Every few minutes those tankers are going out filled with bottles of water.
[02:13:53.060 --> 02:13:55.022]  The Nestle Corporation pays $100 a year to
[02:13:58.541 --> 02:13:59.682]  Well, that's the way it always is.
[02:13:59.682 --> 02:14:08.549]  It's like the new Federal Reserve bailout, where MSNBC and everybody else gets secret federal money from taxpayers, and then we're not allowed to be told.
[02:14:08.549 --> 02:14:19.378]  I mean, that's why it's like Obama giving waivers to hundreds of mega-businesses that don't have to buy government-run insurance, but then the local hamburger place, they don't get the exemption.
[02:14:19.378 --> 02:14:25.343]  Nobody can compete against somebody like Nestle paying a hundred bucks a year for millions of gallons of water.
[02:14:26.611 --> 02:14:28.813]  I mean, I pay hundreds a month for water.
[02:14:28.813 --> 02:14:29.134]  Sure.
[02:14:29.134 --> 02:14:32.857]  And their story is, well, we provide employment in an area that needed employment.
[02:14:32.857 --> 02:14:33.398]  Oh, true.
[02:14:33.398 --> 02:14:34.318]  Yeah, I can't dispute that.
[02:14:34.318 --> 02:14:34.699]  They do.
[02:14:34.699 --> 02:14:37.401]  A lot of people, a lot of locals got jobs.
[02:14:37.401 --> 02:14:39.303]  You know, there's jobs for truckers, there's jobs for everybody else.
[02:14:39.303 --> 02:14:42.146]  But it shows how insiders play by a different set of rules.
[02:14:42.146 --> 02:14:42.947]  Oh, without a doubt.
[02:14:42.947 --> 02:14:43.527]  Without a doubt.
[02:14:43.527 --> 02:14:48.952]  And this episode, which airs tomorrow night, and I'm going to pitch it here to everybody, 10 o'clock on TruTV.
[02:14:50.293 --> 02:15:10.982]  This episode will blow your mind as it blew mine, because as it develops, you see this thing unravel, and we unravel this conspiracy about water, layer by layer by layer, and what you're going to hear is, as we start with this plant in Stanwood, Michigan, where all this water is being taken, and then what you discover
[02:15:13.083 --> 02:15:19.005]  There are three big multinationals all over the world, and what they're doing is they're privatizing water.
[02:15:19.005 --> 02:15:26.088]  They go into municipalities, they go into states, they go, hey, you guys are government, you guys are idiots, you don't know what you're doing, which is a pretty good argument to make.
[02:15:26.088 --> 02:15:33.252]  What we're going to do is we're going to take over your water supply, we're going to take over your municipal water system, and we're going to run it better, and we're going to pay you royalty.
[02:15:33.252 --> 02:15:36.333]  And a bunch of cities and states go, cool, let's go.
[02:15:37.637 --> 02:15:45.863]  And then what you discover is, just like insiders all over the world, as you pointed out, Alex, suddenly the rules change.
[02:15:45.863 --> 02:15:47.944]  The price gets jacked up.
[02:15:47.944 --> 02:15:49.625]  Water quality isn't as good.
[02:15:49.625 --> 02:15:51.466]  All kinds of stuff starts to happen.
[02:15:51.466 --> 02:15:56.090]  And you can't, a lot of these deals, you know, these, you know, smaller towns, they can't get out of them.
[02:15:56.090 --> 02:16:02.094]  You know, because, you know, Nestle and a couple other French companies, Veolia and Suez are the biggest ones.
[02:16:02.094 --> 02:16:04.035]  None of them, by the way, are American companies.
[02:16:04.035 --> 02:16:05.856]  Yeah, there's German, there's Dutch, there's...
[02:16:06.937 --> 02:16:20.702]  Our French and Swiss, you know, Britain has Thames water, and if you look all over the world in third world countries, like developing world countries, these countries, these companies go out there and they buy huge amounts of water and you can't take them out.
[02:16:20.702 --> 02:16:23.463]  Now, here's what you've got to realize.
[02:16:23.463 --> 02:16:35.208]  As we peel back the layers, pull back the layers, in this show, what you're going to find out is the big oil families, the big oil players, suddenly are getting into water.
[02:16:36.471 --> 02:16:40.615]  Water, we've all seen this headline, water is the new oil.
[02:16:40.615 --> 02:16:46.040]  And one of the primary families doing this are our friends, the Bushes.
[02:16:46.040 --> 02:16:49.924]  The Bushes have bought 98,000 acres.
[02:16:49.924 --> 02:16:56.510]  I want everyone to just picture that for a minute, 98,000 acres in South America.
[02:16:56.510 --> 02:16:59.433]  It's in an area actually that borders different countries.
[02:16:59.433 --> 02:17:02.436]  It's near Paraguay, and you know where Paraguay meets Brazil.
[02:17:03.804 --> 02:17:07.066]  You know, right there on the southern border of Brazil, the northern border of Paraguay.
[02:17:07.066 --> 02:17:09.747]  Why did they buy 98,000 acres?
[02:17:09.747 --> 02:17:11.067]  I'll tell you.
[02:17:11.067 --> 02:17:14.889]  Because it sits over the world's largest aquifer.
[02:17:14.889 --> 02:17:17.390]  Excuse me, the largest aquifer in the Western Hemisphere.
[02:17:17.390 --> 02:17:19.291]  Sorry, there's a larger one in Russia.
[02:17:19.291 --> 02:17:21.492]  And the biggest in the U.S.
[02:17:21.492 --> 02:17:24.293]  is under Texas, and that's where Boone Pickens has moved in.
[02:17:25.250 --> 02:17:26.871]  He's a smart man.
[02:17:45.864 --> 02:17:58.002]  And then they lobby all over the US and Europe to ban you having your own well or collecting rainwater just like their Food Safety Act shuts down you growing food at your own farm because they're creating artificial scarcity.
[02:17:58.447 --> 02:18:03.070]  Yes, I didn't realize there are laws to... You mean I can't sink my own well in a lot of places?
[02:18:03.070 --> 02:18:04.511]  Yes.
[02:18:04.511 --> 02:18:06.532]  And they're the ones lobbying for it.
[02:18:06.532 --> 02:18:14.657]  Oh sure, they want to control... If you wanted to control a population... Let's say you were a particular group of elites and you wanted to control a population.
[02:18:14.657 --> 02:18:17.559]  Well, there's two ways that are the most efficient way to do it.
[02:18:17.559 --> 02:18:19.540]  You control the water and you control the food.
[02:18:19.540 --> 02:18:21.341]  That's pretty much the best way you can do it.
[02:18:21.341 --> 02:18:23.782]  You cannot live more than two weeks without water.
[02:18:23.782 --> 02:18:24.463]  You can't.
[02:18:24.463 --> 02:18:26.384]  Usually you will die within three or four days.
[02:18:26.924 --> 02:18:27.044]  Yes.
[02:18:27.044 --> 02:18:27.124]  Yes.
[02:18:46.222 --> 02:18:51.325]  Figured out that in Texas, if you own the land, you also own the water rights.
[02:18:51.325 --> 02:18:59.650]  So what T. Boone did, again being the billionaire that he is, is he bought up a whole bunch of land, and on his ranch he created a town.
[02:18:59.650 --> 02:19:02.651]  And a town gets to have its own water district.
[02:19:02.651 --> 02:19:04.953]  And guess who the citizens of the town are?
[02:19:04.953 --> 02:19:06.534]  T. Boone's employees.
[02:19:06.534 --> 02:19:07.474]  So what does he do?
[02:19:07.474 --> 02:19:13.938]  He sinks a lot of pumps in there, starts to suck out the, it's called the Ogallala Aquifer, which I'm sure a lot of people have heard of.
[02:19:14.721 --> 02:19:16.843]  Am I talking too fast?
[02:19:16.843 --> 02:19:19.285]  No, you're right on target.
[02:19:19.285 --> 02:19:24.891]  Okay, I'm so lewd up about this that, you know, it just makes me crazy that this stuff is happening.
[02:19:24.891 --> 02:19:28.414]  You know, in fact, talking to the crew, you guys have really been wound up about watering.
[02:19:28.414 --> 02:19:39.704]  You should be, because in your investigation, it's not just they're creating an oligopoly, not just creating artificial scarcity, not just running these scams, not just trying to keep us from getting our own water, but
[02:19:40.765 --> 02:19:42.646]  They're adding stuff to the water.
[02:19:42.646 --> 02:19:43.767]  Michael Braverman, stay there.
[02:19:43.767 --> 02:19:44.307]  Let's continue.
[02:19:44.307 --> 02:19:45.668]  You know, this is riveting.
[02:19:45.668 --> 02:19:46.949]  This affects everybody.
[02:19:46.949 --> 02:19:50.031]  Our bodies are 75% water.
[02:19:50.031 --> 02:19:51.873]  Water is life.
[02:19:51.873 --> 02:19:56.696]  And this just shows how dastardly these robber barons are, these new water barons.
[02:19:56.696 --> 02:19:57.516]  We'll be right back.

[02:21:00.966 --> 02:21:03.287]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:21:03.287 --> 02:21:05.668]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:21:05.668 --> 02:21:08.869]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:21:08.869 --> 02:21:13.971]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:21:13.971 --> 02:21:18.173]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:21:18.493 --> 02:21:20.834]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:21:20.834 --> 02:21:23.375]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:21:23.375 --> 02:21:26.637]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:21:26.637 --> 02:21:34.240]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:21:34.577 --> 02:21:39.959]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:21:39.959 --> 02:21:42.820]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:21:42.820 --> 02:21:46.501]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:21:46.501 --> 02:21:47.562]  And I got news for you.
[02:21:47.562 --> 02:21:48.902]  You're everyone else.

[02:22:29.657 --> 02:22:30.918]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:30.918 --> 02:22:35.481]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:35.481 --> 02:22:41.285]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:41.285 --> 02:22:44.927]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[02:24:03.072 --> 02:24:09.641]  Alright, Michael Braverman is our guest, and you noticed it wasn't hype about the FEMA camp police stage special.
[02:24:10.447 --> 02:24:18.949]  I mean, I saw the reviews online, the listeners, even mainstream, you know, people on YouTube, they said, boy, Alex wasn't joking when he said this is groundbreaking.
[02:24:18.949 --> 02:24:36.353]  Confirming the FEMA camps, the secret police takeover plan, the deathbed confession last week of E. Howard Hunt on national TV, all the other big revelations, Lee Harvey Oswald's widow saying, look, you know, my kids aren't safe if I talk to you.
[02:24:36.353 --> 02:24:37.994]  Bombshell stuff.
[02:24:37.994 --> 02:24:39.134]  Well, tomorrow night,
[02:24:40.899 --> 02:24:42.080]  Tomorrow night, 10 p.m.
[02:24:42.080 --> 02:24:43.320]  Eastern, 9 p.m.
[02:24:43.320 --> 02:24:44.341]  Central.
[02:24:44.341 --> 02:24:45.922]  Tell everybody you know to tune in.
[02:24:45.922 --> 02:24:48.503]  By the way, Michael, when are they going to air the Police State Special again?
[02:24:48.503 --> 02:24:52.085]  Because I know they usually air a previous episode at 8 p.m.
[02:24:52.085 --> 02:24:54.046]  Central, right before the new one.
[02:24:54.046 --> 02:24:55.366]  Well, that's when it should be on.
[02:24:55.366 --> 02:24:58.568]  Although sometimes the network, you know, sort of flips the schedule around.
[02:24:58.568 --> 02:25:01.890]  Although I believe that it will be on at... it should be on at 9.
[02:25:04.093 --> 02:25:06.294]  That's 9 Eastern, that's 9 Eastern.
[02:25:06.294 --> 02:25:09.436]  Right now it is scheduled to air before the new episode.
[02:25:09.436 --> 02:25:12.197]  Yeah, I urge everybody to take a look at that again on the rerun.
[02:25:12.197 --> 02:25:24.603]  It's an amazing episode because as you know, Alex, we got in a lot of trouble for that episode because we shined the light on stuff that they don't want the light shined on.
[02:25:24.603 --> 02:25:28.545]  And I gotta say, I wanna give a shout out to TruTV.
[02:25:28.545 --> 02:25:30.126]  TruTV has more courage
[02:25:30.786 --> 02:25:35.427]  Well, I mean, tomorrow night you're going to expose that the government's putting uranium in the water to sterilize us.
[02:25:35.427 --> 02:25:40.168]  I mean, folks, and what's incredible is you exposed the UN climate fraud.
[02:25:57.739 --> 02:26:01.360]  Shot it months before and then it aired right as Climategate came out.
[02:26:01.360 --> 02:26:07.002]  Now it's breaking in Texas news that they're covering up the uranium in the water right as you come out with it.
[02:26:07.002 --> 02:26:09.482]  But I mean, just to interrupt, this is a short segment.
[02:26:09.482 --> 02:26:12.743]  Let's go over the bullet points that we're allowed to reveal here.
[02:26:12.743 --> 02:26:16.784]  Ventura reveals that foreign companies are stealing water from the Great Lakes.
[02:26:16.784 --> 02:26:18.305]  The Nestle Corporation stashes.
[02:26:19.065 --> 02:26:20.585]  By the way, I'm just going to stop you.
[02:26:20.585 --> 02:26:26.047]  When you guys watch the show, when your listeners watch the show, you will see us and we shoot a thing and we got a local guy and he goes, see that over there?
[02:26:26.047 --> 02:26:26.927]  We have a new name for that.
[02:26:26.927 --> 02:26:28.227]  That's called the Dead Stream.
[02:26:46.149 --> 02:26:47.370]  And it's being shipped to China!
[02:26:58.307 --> 02:27:02.290]  The show also shows these giant, tell them about the water bags.
[02:27:02.290 --> 02:27:04.172]  Oh yeah, well here's another thing.
[02:27:04.172 --> 02:27:08.915]  There's a technology out there and you can google it, it's called the Sprague Bag.
[02:27:08.915 --> 02:27:12.458]  It's based on a guy named Larry Sprague who invented it.
[02:27:12.458 --> 02:27:17.982]  Basically what they're going to do is they're going to make these giant floating water bladders.
[02:27:17.982 --> 02:27:21.745]  And because fresh water, as I found out, is lighter than sea water.
[02:27:21.745 --> 02:27:24.767]  So basically you can put a huge water train of
[02:27:24.807 --> 02:27:47.789]  Fifty of these things, you know, a hundred football fields long, towed across the ocean with our fresh water, and as one of our guests says, they're going to take our champagne water, water that's been in the ground for millions of years, you know, which is this fresh, life-giving water, they can take that anytime they want, and we let them do it, the government lets them do it, put it in these giant water trains, a hundred football fields long, and ship it
[02:27:49.008 --> 02:27:52.410]  To America's enemies, if that's what they feel like doing.
[02:27:52.410 --> 02:27:53.912]  For $100 a year!
[02:27:53.912 --> 02:27:56.173]  Let me just finish these bullet points.
[02:27:56.173 --> 02:27:56.974]  No, no, no, no.
[02:27:56.974 --> 02:27:58.695]  I mean, you can tell we're both frothing here.
[02:27:58.695 --> 02:28:06.821]  And by the way, this one makes Jesse Ventura, this one made him so angry, and you'll see it on the screen.
[02:28:06.821 --> 02:28:15.327]  No, no, I was with him in person in Austin after he got back from the Great Lakes, and I've never seen him turning red and grabbing my shoulder going, Alex, they're stealing it!
[02:28:15.327 --> 02:28:16.448]  I mean, he was frothing!
[02:28:18.726 --> 02:28:21.609]  Oh, so he gets mad on the show then?
[02:28:21.609 --> 02:28:24.332]  Oh yeah, because it's right there.
[02:28:24.332 --> 02:28:27.094]  You know, people think that we hype this stuff up, as you said.
[02:28:27.094 --> 02:28:28.115]  It's right there.
[02:28:28.115 --> 02:28:30.517]  All you gotta do is Google Stanwood, Michigan.
[02:28:30.517 --> 02:28:37.604]  You can't hype up big enough them putting uranium in the water to literally destroy our sperm count, now down by 87%.
[02:28:37.604 --> 02:28:40.747]  You can't hype that enough!
[02:28:40.747 --> 02:28:41.949]  Well, let's go to that a second.
[02:28:42.749 --> 02:28:44.691]  Again, you can Google this.
[02:28:44.691 --> 02:28:45.812]  Anybody can Google this.
[02:28:45.812 --> 02:28:50.835]  Male birth rates all around the world are dropping precipitously in some cases.
[02:28:50.835 --> 02:28:53.137]  This goes across all species.
[02:28:53.137 --> 02:28:55.079]  This is not just human beings.
[02:28:55.079 --> 02:28:58.141]  Male birth rates, male fertility is dropping.
[02:28:58.141 --> 02:28:59.222]  This is a fact.
[02:28:59.222 --> 02:29:00.363]  This is a drop-dead
[02:29:01.812 --> 02:29:02.813]  Now, why is that happening?
[02:29:02.813 --> 02:29:11.299]  Well, one of the reasons it's happening is uranium, even in trace amounts in the water, has a terrible effect on male fertility.
[02:29:11.299 --> 02:29:12.960]  Terrible effect on testosterone.
[02:29:12.960 --> 02:29:15.502]  But what it does is, it increases estrogen.
[02:29:16.628 --> 02:29:35.034]  So you have all of a sudden you have fish showing up all over the world and especially in here in the United States do you have fish showing up with both organs with both male and female sex organs you have otters don't ask me why it's otters because I guess because they live in the water I can tell you why stay there they're they're hermaphrodites now because the alluvial
[02:29:36.291 --> 02:29:38.672]  They're dumping all the water we've used into rivers.
[02:29:38.672 --> 02:29:40.732]  It's got the estrogen, the chemicals in it.
[02:29:40.732 --> 02:29:43.493]  The otters then eat shellfish where it precipitates.
[02:29:43.493 --> 02:29:45.313]  It bioaccumulates in the otters.
[02:29:45.313 --> 02:29:46.314]  Stay there.
[02:29:46.314 --> 02:29:47.634]  This is key intel.
[02:29:47.634 --> 02:29:51.235]  The radiation attacks straight ahead.
[02:29:51.235 --> 02:29:52.635]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.635 --> 02:29:55.156]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.156 --> 02:29:57.837]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:03.106 --> 02:30:04.827]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.

[02:31:02.085 --> 02:31:06.106]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:31:06.106 --> 02:31:09.347]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:31:09.347 --> 02:31:14.148]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:31:14.148 --> 02:31:20.530]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:31:20.530 --> 02:31:22.771]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:31:23.311 --> 02:31:23.611]  Tim Geithner?
[02:31:23.611 --> 02:31:24.131]  Bernanke?
[02:31:24.131 --> 02:31:24.792]  They're arsonists!
[02:31:24.792 --> 02:31:26.072]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:31:26.072 --> 02:31:28.313]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:31:42.219 --> 02:31:44.342]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:31:44.342 --> 02:31:49.489]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:31:49.489 --> 02:31:58.621]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:32:59.116 --> 02:33:00.937]  Thank you.
[02:33:00.937 --> 02:33:05.880]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:19.377 --> 02:33:21.699]  We've only got part of this segment left with Michael Braverman.
[02:33:21.699 --> 02:33:24.821]  This is so important, I might try to just get him back up tomorrow.
[02:33:24.821 --> 02:33:27.683]  Because I haven't even gotten into the other bullet points.
[02:33:27.683 --> 02:33:29.804]  Male birth rates are dropping all over the world.
[02:33:29.804 --> 02:33:37.469]  Radiation exposure expert Lauren Marais states that uranium in our water is leading to mass feminization of the population.
[02:33:37.469 --> 02:33:37.970]  Not to mention
[02:33:38.590 --> 02:33:41.352]  Kidney and other failure.
[02:33:41.352 --> 02:33:43.154]  Pancreas is going out.
[02:33:43.154 --> 02:33:44.775]  I was watching the news this weekend.
[02:33:44.775 --> 02:33:48.578]  They estimate half the public by 2020 will have diabetes.
[02:33:48.578 --> 02:33:53.262]  In fact, guys, put up some of those mainstream headlines about Texas covering up the uranium.
[02:33:53.262 --> 02:33:54.383]  They're putting it in the water.
[02:33:54.383 --> 02:33:56.384]  Of course they're covering it up.
[02:33:56.384 --> 02:33:57.005]  There it is.
[02:33:57.005 --> 02:33:59.507]  A KHOU, a CBS Houston.
[02:33:59.507 --> 02:34:03.910]  I-Team says state lowballs radiation score in drinking water.
[02:34:04.611 --> 02:34:06.212]  Then we've got the other headlines.
[02:34:06.212 --> 02:34:13.458]  State and feds cover up uranium, radium, and other things in the water.
[02:34:13.458 --> 02:34:15.239]  Male birth rates are dropping.
[02:34:15.239 --> 02:34:17.280]  A big brother wants you to be calm, docile.
[02:34:17.280 --> 02:34:21.223]  Government experts are advocating lithium in the water, municipal water districts.
[02:34:21.223 --> 02:34:22.104]  See, this is happening.
[02:34:26.121 --> 02:34:30.366]  Please continue, Michael Braverman, with this show coming up 10 p.m.
[02:34:30.366 --> 02:34:31.588]  Eastern, 9 p.m.
[02:34:31.588 --> 02:34:33.470]  Central.
[02:34:33.470 --> 02:34:43.884]  The episode's called The Great Lakes, but it's a lot more than that, because what it was like for you once you started investigating lithium and uranium in the water, and the show takes a big turn.
[02:34:44.355 --> 02:34:45.255]  Yes.
[02:34:45.255 --> 02:34:46.536]  I just want to say one thing.
[02:34:46.536 --> 02:34:51.518]  The new title of the show is the World Wide Water Conspiracy.
[02:34:51.518 --> 02:34:54.199]  I know that's a little unwieldy, but that is the new title.
[02:34:54.199 --> 02:34:56.440]  The World Wide Water Conspiracy.
[02:34:56.440 --> 02:34:57.160]  Why?
[02:34:57.160 --> 02:34:58.901]  Because it's bigger than the Great Lakes.
[02:34:58.901 --> 02:35:00.962]  It's world wide.
[02:35:00.962 --> 02:35:01.922]  I'm glad they changed that.
[02:35:01.922 --> 02:35:02.402]  Okay.
[02:35:02.402 --> 02:35:03.643]  Yeah.
[02:35:03.643 --> 02:35:06.484]  Now Alex, you gave us the turn.
[02:35:06.484 --> 02:35:07.004]  One turn.
[02:35:07.004 --> 02:35:09.225]  And then I'm going to go through this really quickly.
[02:35:09.225 --> 02:35:09.485]  No, no.
[02:35:09.485 --> 02:35:10.586]  You've got plenty of time.
[02:35:10.586 --> 02:35:11.406]  You've got the floor.
[02:35:11.406 --> 02:35:12.987]  Break down what they're putting in the water.
[02:35:13.829 --> 02:35:25.116]  And I'm going to do that, and then I'm going to give you and your listeners something, I'll bet Alex you may not even know all this, and this, the thing I'm going to say in a second is going to blow people's minds.
[02:35:25.116 --> 02:35:33.601]  And again, I'm not saying that with a hype, I'm not saying that as some conspiracy kook, I'm saying this as a normal guy who got into this being a TV producer.
[02:35:33.601 --> 02:35:33.841]  Okay.
[02:35:35.762 --> 02:35:37.163]  We're good to go.
[02:35:48.280 --> 02:35:54.122]  Bipolar mental disorders, and what it does is it makes you calm, it makes you docile.
[02:35:54.122 --> 02:36:14.548]  So again, more lithium in the water, their argument is suicide rates go down, but the real argument, as far as I'm concerned, is Big Brother wants a docile population, and, you know, if you're, you know, juiced up on lithium, the chances that you're gonna, like, actually take some action and actually think for yourself decrease.
[02:36:14.548 --> 02:36:16.028]  Because if you're on lithium, you don't care.
[02:36:17.491 --> 02:36:25.018]  And you can read this where government scientists, and it's all over the internet, are advocating, are actually saying, let's put lithium in the water.
[02:36:25.018 --> 02:36:38.369]  Because when you have trace amounts of naturally occurring lithium, they make this argument, which is completely bogus, that in those areas, one of which is in Texas, where you have naturally occurring lithium, crime rates and suicide rates go down.
[02:36:39.207 --> 02:36:45.208]  Which, you know, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to look at that argument and call it for the B.S.
[02:36:45.208 --> 02:36:45.588]  that it is.
[02:36:45.588 --> 02:36:51.950]  Now, the second thing is what we learned on the show, which is lithium works with uranium.
[02:36:51.950 --> 02:37:01.552]  These two chemicals in a hydrology... I'm so excited about this, it makes me crazy.
[02:37:01.552 --> 02:37:04.693]  They actually work and they actually increase each other's efficacy.
[02:37:06.770 --> 02:37:08.292]  Oh, it's all... Look, look, sir!
[02:37:08.292 --> 02:37:09.533]  We have eco-science!
[02:37:09.533 --> 02:37:11.215]  They planned it all!
[02:37:11.215 --> 02:37:12.557]  The White House science czar!
[02:37:12.557 --> 02:37:14.259]  These people are pure evil!
[02:37:14.259 --> 02:37:24.791]  Absolutely, and I... That's what Dr. Blaylock, brain surgeon, said, is that all these things work together, and that fluoride then activates and supercharges... Absolutely.
[02:37:24.791 --> 02:37:26.253]  It's a slow poisoning.
[02:37:27.113 --> 02:37:30.776]  But exactly, but the fluoride is an adjuvant.
[02:37:30.776 --> 02:37:38.463]  Just like they add things to vaccines to supercharge them, the fluoride is the adjuvant that turbocharges it.
[02:37:38.463 --> 02:37:47.471]  But Michael, you've got the proof in here, and then now it's even in the news in Texas, but they say, oh, we don't know why uranium's there or why the state covers it up.
[02:37:47.471 --> 02:37:48.552]  Because they're adding it.
[02:37:48.552 --> 02:37:49.273]  Please continue.
[02:37:53.761 --> 02:37:55.483]  Your listeners understand this.
[02:37:55.483 --> 02:37:59.526]  You know, TruTV has this immense amount of courage to put this show on.
[02:37:59.526 --> 02:38:02.888]  Jesse Ventura has a huge amount of courage to put this show on.
[02:38:02.888 --> 02:38:09.433]  And I told you two weeks ago, there are people out there, there are forces out there, and I can't really say who they are.
[02:38:09.433 --> 02:38:12.096]  Because, you know, I have my own issues to protect.
[02:38:12.096 --> 02:38:13.897]  They do not want this show on the air.
[02:38:13.897 --> 02:38:15.959]  They want this show killed.
[02:38:15.959 --> 02:38:22.724]  The only way to keep this show alive is by people who want free information, people who are willing to expand their minds to watch the show.
[02:38:23.599 --> 02:38:27.782]  Now, all that being said, I'm going to tell you something that is not on the show.
[02:38:27.782 --> 02:38:33.227]  And I can't tell you the reason it's not on the show, because, again, I have to protect my insiders.
[02:38:33.227 --> 02:38:35.088]  But this is going to blow your people's minds.
[02:38:35.088 --> 02:38:36.509]  And it's going to blow your mind, too, Alex.
[02:38:36.509 --> 02:38:37.810]  You already know about this.
[02:38:37.810 --> 02:38:39.372]  You're talking about the New World Order.
[02:38:39.372 --> 02:38:42.694]  Everyone talks about the New World Order and the elites.
[02:38:42.694 --> 02:38:46.217]  It's right here, in black and white, right on the Internet.
[02:38:46.217 --> 02:38:48.879]  There's a thing called the Saint Lazar Foundation.
[02:38:48.879 --> 02:38:49.820]  It's based in Europe.
[02:38:50.726 --> 02:38:53.092]  It's run by the Duc d'Angers.
[02:38:53.092 --> 02:38:55.497]  This is, you know, it's called a military order.
[02:38:55.497 --> 02:38:58.223]  It started in the, you know, in the Second Crusades.
[02:38:59.241 --> 02:39:02.263]  They do lots of humanitarian stuff.
[02:39:02.263 --> 02:39:03.604]  You know, they have meetings.
[02:39:03.604 --> 02:39:07.427]  It's really the royals of Europe, of a lot of the countries of Europe.
[02:39:07.427 --> 02:39:16.354]  It's international royalty, and it's, you know, a lot of sort of, you know, business royalty all over the world, or at least in the Western world, in Europe and the United States.
[02:39:16.354 --> 02:39:20.697]  Now, I'm going to read you from their website, which anybody can go on the net.
[02:39:20.697 --> 02:39:22.559]  If you just Google, Order of St.
[02:39:22.559 --> 02:39:25.981]  Lazarus, comma, water, you will see this.
[02:39:25.981 --> 02:39:27.923]  I'm going to read it.
[02:39:28.800 --> 02:39:29.120]  St.
[02:39:29.120 --> 02:39:43.915]  Lazar Investment Arm will be the largest owner of aquatic property and thus will face the prerogatives of future international ecological policies from the point of view of an investor in a carbon finance marketplace.
[02:39:43.915 --> 02:39:44.756]  But wait, I'm not done!
[02:39:45.416 --> 02:39:46.196]  Now again, I'm reading.
[02:39:46.196 --> 02:39:47.177]  These are quotes.
[02:39:47.177 --> 02:39:48.938]  Anybody can go and find this.
[02:39:48.938 --> 02:39:52.920]  Water will soon become an instrument of power and influence.
[02:39:52.920 --> 02:39:54.421]  And we're going to go on.
[02:39:54.421 --> 02:40:02.105]  The Saint Lazar Foundation aims to become an essential global player specializing in water.
[02:40:03.939 --> 02:40:04.539]  Wow.
[02:40:04.539 --> 02:40:05.740]  Now, I'm not making this up.
[02:40:05.740 --> 02:40:08.502]  Anybody can go, again, I'm going to say it again, Order of St.
[02:40:08.502 --> 02:40:10.864]  Lazarus, comma, water.
[02:40:10.864 --> 02:40:12.245]  Now, that's like Order of the Garter.
[02:40:12.245 --> 02:40:13.465]  That's the royal families.
[02:40:13.465 --> 02:40:19.489]  And I didn't know this specifically, but I knew that they were involved in the carbon takeover.
[02:40:19.489 --> 02:40:19.850]  Sure.
[02:40:19.850 --> 02:40:31.878]  And that their name had come up in association with what Lord Blackheath came out with in Parliament, that there's a secret, or in the House of Lords, a secret Foundation X setting up world government.
[02:40:37.254 --> 02:40:39.716]  It's one of the world's most exclusive society.
[02:40:39.716 --> 02:40:41.877]  Again, I'm reading from the website.
[02:40:41.877 --> 02:40:48.982]  It comprises those men and women around the world who are part of the economic, financial, social, or cultural elite.
[02:40:48.982 --> 02:40:49.843]  It's right here.
[02:40:49.843 --> 02:40:57.188]  And then they say they want to become the essential global player specializing in water.
[02:40:57.188 --> 02:40:59.309]  So, this is not in the show.
[02:40:59.309 --> 02:41:02.712]  I'm giving this to you and to your listeners because you've been such a supporter of the show.
[02:41:04.753 --> 02:41:05.553]  It freaked me out.
[02:41:05.553 --> 02:41:09.616]  I mean, I couldn't sleep at night after reading this, because they're not even hiding.
[02:41:09.616 --> 02:41:12.457]  The New World Order, the elites, are not even hiding.
[02:41:12.457 --> 02:41:13.718]  It's right there on the website.
[02:41:13.718 --> 02:41:14.678]  I'm not making this up.
[02:41:14.678 --> 02:41:16.279]  Anybody can go see it.
[02:41:16.279 --> 02:41:24.964]  Now, it's not in the show, and I can't tell you the reasons it's not in the show, because, again, I have to protect my insiders.
[02:41:24.964 --> 02:41:32.808]  Even though this is right out in public and they say it, but I had an inside source, and I have to protect that source, obviously, and, you know, none of us want to get killed.
[02:41:34.062 --> 02:41:41.526]  But I just urge everybody to open their minds, go on the internet, and read this stuff for themselves.
[02:41:41.526 --> 02:41:42.186]  Absolutely.
[02:41:42.186 --> 02:41:52.032]  Now, shifting gears back into the uranium, get into what the uranium is doing in the water and how they're getting it into the water to combine with the lithium and the fluoride.
[02:41:52.964 --> 02:41:57.590]  Some uranium is naturally occurring, some of it is clearly pumped in.
[02:41:57.590 --> 02:42:01.294]  There's a lot of ways where they do it.
[02:42:01.294 --> 02:42:11.026]  They're actually, in the city of L.A., when they lay new pipes, new water pipes for the DWP, Department of Water and Power, some of these pipes have little chemical dispensers built right on the pipe.
[02:42:12.378 --> 02:42:13.318]  Remotely activated.
[02:42:13.318 --> 02:42:16.979]  There could be nothing in them now.
[02:42:16.979 --> 02:42:22.481]  It would take almost nothing for a bunch of crews to go out and put trace amounts of uranium in those chemical dispensers.
[02:42:22.481 --> 02:42:30.924]  Well, our research shows, and it's confirmed, this is hidden in plain view, that the phosphate mining out of limestone is where they get the sodium fluoride byproduct.
[02:42:30.924 --> 02:42:36.245]  And the EPA admits they're allowed to have certain amounts of other chemicals.
[02:42:36.245 --> 02:42:37.946]  And where do you mine the uranium?
[02:42:37.946 --> 02:42:39.567]  In the same limestone deposit.
[02:42:39.567 --> 02:42:40.867]  And that there is uranium in it.
[02:42:41.187 --> 02:42:44.368]  So when they add the so-called fluoride, it's got the uranium.
[02:42:44.368 --> 02:42:45.488]  Well, here's something even scarier.
[02:42:45.488 --> 02:42:52.430]  A lot of depleted uranium weapons, as your listeners know, were used in both Middle East wars and both Iraq wars.
[02:42:52.430 --> 02:42:52.890]  Yes.
[02:42:52.890 --> 02:43:01.052]  That depleted uranium gets picked up by the wind, gets picked up, you know, it goes into the clouds, goes into the air currents, and gets dropped everywhere.
[02:43:01.052 --> 02:43:06.053]  So the fact is that this stuff is basically falling on us if you follow the air currents all around the world.
[02:43:06.053 --> 02:43:10.154]  And again, what this uranium does, even trace tiny amounts of what it does, and
[02:43:10.954 --> 02:43:23.006]  Our show has this woman, Lorraine Murray, who is a radiation researcher for public health and was kicked out of the Lawrence Livermore lab because she blew the whistle.
[02:43:23.006 --> 02:43:28.271]  And what this stuff does is it is feminizing our population.
[02:43:28.271 --> 02:43:34.057]  Male fertility, male birth rates, male characteristics are down all throughout the world.
[02:43:34.057 --> 02:43:34.497]  Terrifying.
[02:43:37.099 --> 02:43:46.961]  And they're doing it, and will people listening to this go research that it's in the Texas newspapers that there's all this uranium and other radioactive isotopes at levels that it shouldn't be?
[02:43:46.961 --> 02:43:49.282]  They're adding it to the water.
[02:43:49.282 --> 02:43:51.943]  I've covered it with Dr. Conant here on the air.
[02:43:51.943 --> 02:44:06.166]  This is the reality, and it is so important that when they try to say, hey, we're just putting fluoride in the water, it's good for you, even though they know it causes cancer and all the rest of it, and accelerates the effect of other toxins and poisons, as a adjuvant,
[02:44:07.153 --> 02:44:16.576]  The key is, they cannot sell people that mercury and lead and uranium is good, and that is being added along with the fluoride.
[02:44:16.576 --> 02:44:28.821]  It's all called fluoride, but it's just the toxic waste derivatives, and they allow it because it's overall to reduce fertility, as the book written 25 years ago by the White House science czar, John P. Holdren, wrote.
[02:44:29.901 --> 02:44:30.582]  Just amazing.
[02:44:30.582 --> 02:44:32.263]  Michael Breverman, God bless you.
[02:44:32.263 --> 02:44:37.827]  We appreciate your time here with us today and we'll talk to you again in the very near future.
[02:44:37.827 --> 02:44:39.368]  Amazing information.
[02:44:39.368 --> 02:44:40.889]  Again, tomorrow night, True TV.
[02:44:40.889 --> 02:44:44.792]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you don't have cable or don't have it, get to your friends' or family's house.
[02:44:44.792 --> 02:44:45.693]  Call everybody you know.
[02:44:45.693 --> 02:44:51.417]  We're going to have a big report out on this tomorrow at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com with the bullet points.
[02:44:51.417 --> 02:44:56.040]  The videos are going to be uploaded as well to PrisonPlanet.tv of what we covered here.
[02:44:56.040 --> 02:44:57.081]  Michael, we'll talk to you soon.
[02:44:57.501 --> 02:44:58.941]  Alex, thanks again for having me on.
[02:44:58.941 --> 02:44:59.201]  You bet.
[02:44:59.201 --> 02:45:05.663]  And then coming up the week after this, next week, is going to be the oil spill.
[02:45:05.663 --> 02:45:08.463]  So that's going to be powerful as well.
[02:45:08.463 --> 02:45:10.624]  Do we have Max Keiser?
[02:45:10.624 --> 02:45:11.844]  Okay, fantastic.
[02:45:11.844 --> 02:45:14.745]  I wanted to just get Max Keiser on in the last 15 minutes.
[02:45:14.745 --> 02:45:15.745]  Wow!
[02:45:15.745 --> 02:45:19.766]  Knowingly putting uranium in the water to attack male fertility.
[02:45:19.766 --> 02:45:23.747]  And he never got into what was happening with the sea life off the coast.
[02:45:25.640 --> 02:45:30.004]  I mean, the otters being born in record numbers with both sexes.
[02:45:30.004 --> 02:45:32.327]  It's girls going into puberty at age three.
[02:45:32.327 --> 02:45:34.549]  I mean, it's just bonkers.
[02:45:34.549 --> 02:45:36.911]  We are under chemical warfare attack.
[02:45:36.911 --> 02:45:37.052]  Now.
[02:45:39.233 --> 02:45:43.395]  Uh, it's in the London Guardian, uh, want JP Morgan to crash, buy silver.
[02:45:43.395 --> 02:45:49.917]  The campaign to buy silver and force JP Morgan into bankruptcy could work because of the liabilities accrued by the short selling.
[02:45:49.917 --> 02:46:01.161]  And Kaiser talks about, uh, you know, what we did a month ago and then again two weeks ago here on the show, uh, sending, uh, you know, silver to $500 an ounce, that becoming the number one search term.
[02:46:01.161 --> 02:46:03.902]  Crash JP Morgan being in the top search terms.
[02:46:03.902 --> 02:46:07.944]  And now silver is reaching its all-time high today, uh, and
[02:46:08.644 --> 02:46:18.347]  The availability of Silver Eagles at an all-time low, and the price of those hitting an all-time high in November, the availability drying up everywhere.
[02:46:18.347 --> 02:46:20.168]  Max Keiser, this is very exciting.
[02:46:20.168 --> 02:46:21.849]  What's happening?
[02:46:21.849 --> 02:46:23.009]  Yeah, it sure is.
[02:46:23.009 --> 02:46:27.711]  You know, Silver, since I was on your show three weeks ago, it's up 9%.
[02:46:27.711 --> 02:46:29.411]  So, do you understand that?
[02:46:29.411 --> 02:46:33.133]  That means it's annualizing at a rate of return greater than 100%.
[02:46:34.599 --> 02:46:34.879]  Yeah.
[02:46:34.879 --> 02:46:35.680]  And by the way, we're not...
[02:46:55.922 --> 02:47:04.065]  We're not tooting our horns here, and who knows if they'll send a hit team after you for really pushing this out there, but we created the TSA stir.
[02:47:04.065 --> 02:47:06.346]  The media is even admitting that now.
[02:47:06.346 --> 02:47:13.789]  This is really other people's brainchild, but you saw the idea and rammed it out here, supercharging it, along with Zero Hedge and others.
[02:47:14.429 --> 02:47:17.331]  And now the Guardian and others are recognizing it.
[02:47:17.331 --> 02:47:20.153]  I don't want to say who calls you because I'm going to wait till it comes out.
[02:47:20.153 --> 02:47:22.675]  But some of the biggest publications in the U.S.
[02:47:22.675 --> 02:47:25.477]  have contacted you about this and what we're doing.
[02:47:25.477 --> 02:47:28.479]  So it just shows the power of alternative media.
[02:47:28.479 --> 02:47:30.000]  And we're not tooting our horn.
[02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:33.862]  You're not tooting your horn when we point out that the power of the people out there.
[02:47:33.862 --> 02:47:39.126]  There are now thousands of videos talking about crash JP Morgan buy silver.
[02:47:39.126 --> 02:47:41.207]  This thing is kind of scary.
[02:47:41.207 --> 02:47:44.029]  I mean I mean it's scary to have this type of power Max.
[02:47:45.069 --> 02:47:46.630]  Well, it was always there.
[02:47:46.630 --> 02:47:51.070]  The power was always there, but it didn't have a single point to focus on.
[02:47:51.070 --> 02:47:56.172]  When I've been on your show before, I've talked about the one-inch punch, or I've talked about how to focus all the energy.
[02:47:56.172 --> 02:47:59.692]  And now you've been saying, well, we should try to do multiple things at once.
[02:47:59.692 --> 02:48:03.473]  And I've always said, no, just try to do one thing and do it on scale.
[02:48:03.473 --> 02:48:07.214]  Get the whole world focused on one thing, and the economies of scale kick in.
[02:48:07.814 --> 02:48:08.974]  And you have success.
[02:48:08.974 --> 02:48:11.755]  And this thing is success within three weeks of having success.
[02:48:11.755 --> 02:48:17.276]  Think about the various campaigns out there that have been going on for years that are still struggling to get acceptance here.
[02:48:17.276 --> 02:48:20.897]  Within three weeks, we're totally transforming the global economy.
[02:48:20.897 --> 02:48:23.017]  We're taking over the New All-Time High.
[02:48:23.017 --> 02:48:25.977]  We're totally disrupting all of the banks' balance sheets.
[02:48:25.977 --> 02:48:33.719]  And we are now going to take back hundreds of billions of dollars that they stole by converting all the paper currency
[02:48:34.259 --> 02:48:34.920]  And it's over.
[02:48:34.920 --> 02:48:46.586]  If you own any of the slave currencies, the dollar, the pound, the euro, the yen, if you own the slave coupon, the slave ticket, the slave currencies, you need to release yourself from bondage and cash it in for silver.
[02:48:46.586 --> 02:48:47.727]  And be a free person!
[02:48:47.727 --> 02:48:49.027]  Be a free man!
[02:48:49.027 --> 02:48:49.768]  Own real money!
[02:48:51.445 --> 02:48:52.586]  Well, well said, Max.
[02:48:52.586 --> 02:48:57.649]  Now, most of our listeners understand this more than even you or I, but we've got a few minutes before break.
[02:48:57.649 --> 02:49:09.757]  In layman's terms, explain why they can normally fix markets, and they've been manipulating this one, but if the mass goes out and buys silver, there's no way Humpty Dumpty can put himself back together again.
[02:49:09.757 --> 02:49:11.798]  Sure.
[02:49:11.798 --> 02:49:17.402]  You know, the precious metals have always been a counterbalance to fiat money and paper money.
[02:49:18.058 --> 02:49:28.043]  And for the past 20 years, as has been documented by groups like the Gold Antitrust Action Committee and the folks over at Zero Hedge, the main banks that are tied to the government, like J.P.
[02:49:28.043 --> 02:49:37.308]  Morgan, they go into the market and they continuously sell silver contracts naked, which means that they are selling contracts that do not exist.
[02:49:37.308 --> 02:49:46.393]  They're counterfeiting securities in order to create a lot of selling, in order to create a lot of downward pressure, in order to create an artificially low price.
[02:49:46.833 --> 02:49:51.537]  And they're able to do this because anytime they need to make good on a contract, the U.S.
[02:49:51.537 --> 02:49:57.101]  government just gives them an unlimited checkbook to keep writing bad checks.
[02:49:57.101 --> 02:50:10.631]  Now, what's happened is that over the past couple of years, the big money out there like Eric Sprott up there, Sprott Asset Management Canada, realized that, hey, JPMorgan has $3.3 billion in these bad bets on their books.
[02:50:10.631 --> 02:50:14.794]  If we take physical delivery, it'll force them to go into the market to buy silver.
[02:50:15.494 --> 02:50:19.417]  And they go bankrupt, and we get rid of a major financial terrorist.
[02:50:19.417 --> 02:50:27.543]  Now, the only pushback to this is people say, well, you know, they can always settle for cash, and they won't have that liability.
[02:50:27.543 --> 02:50:31.607]  But that's false, because if they settle for cash, where do they get that cash?
[02:50:31.607 --> 02:50:38.172]  They have to get it from the government to issue more debt, which only means that the purchasing power of everyone's fiat currency goes down.
[02:50:38.912 --> 02:50:41.494]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:05.174 --> 02:51:10.035]  Eighteen years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:51:10.035 --> 02:51:16.197]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:51:16.197 --> 02:51:18.618]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:51:18.618 --> 02:51:24.720]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:24.720 --> 02:51:28.141]  With Zero Debt in 90 Days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:51:28.141 --> 02:51:30.001]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:51:30.001 --> 02:51:32.002]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[02:51:32.182 --> 02:51:37.865]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days, guaranteed!

[02:52:05.220 --> 02:52:06.482]  Tyranny is here.
[02:52:06.482 --> 02:52:10.426]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:52:10.426 --> 02:52:12.649]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:52:12.649 --> 02:52:18.516]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:52:18.516 --> 02:52:24.783]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:52:25.183 --> 02:52:31.144]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:52:31.144 --> 02:52:35.325]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:52:35.325 --> 02:52:39.626]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:52:39.626 --> 02:52:45.567]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:52:45.567 --> 02:52:49.107]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:52:49.107 --> 02:52:51.088]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:52:51.088 --> 02:52:51.528]  It's here.

[02:53:41.923 --> 02:53:42.923]  Float, boom, boppa boom!
[02:54:12.514 --> 02:54:14.977]  Hey, there's my good buddy the Patriot Jimmy Vaughn.
[02:54:14.977 --> 02:54:20.064]  He just got nominated for a Grammy for Best Blues this year.
[02:54:22.435 --> 02:54:25.156]  Liberty is on the rise.
[02:54:25.156 --> 02:54:28.498]  Hey, we're gonna do 30 minutes, maybe even more of Overdrive.
[02:54:28.498 --> 02:54:30.619]  A lot of stations carry the fourth hour.
[02:54:30.619 --> 02:54:32.479]  We don't always do it live.
[02:54:32.479 --> 02:54:39.402]  But if your AM and FM isn't picking it up, you'll just go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or PrisonPlanet.tv to watch the live streaming video.
[02:54:39.402 --> 02:54:42.684]  You'll be able to hear Max Keiser into the next hour.
[02:54:42.684 --> 02:54:45.405]  We're gonna open the phones up specifically and only.
[02:54:46.377 --> 02:54:47.879]  We're good to go.
[02:55:09.662 --> 02:55:13.064]  Hundreds of billions of dollars, trillions leveraged in derivatives.
[02:55:13.064 --> 02:55:34.793]  Now explain to people in layman's terms, if they're 3.3, 3.6, whatever it is, short in the silver market, naked shorts in there driving it down with money and silver they don't have, silver in the real market selling for 35 bucks an ounce, a lot of shops, showing that even the $29 an ounce is a manipulation on paper.
[02:55:34.793 --> 02:55:38.255]  So more and more this is rearing its head.
[02:55:39.315 --> 02:55:50.834]  But specifically here, explain to people, as you said with cash, if it's only three billion and something, why don't they just go out and buy silver from somebody else to cover it and have a loss?
[02:55:50.834 --> 02:55:51.776]  Explain what you're saying.
[02:55:53.046 --> 02:55:53.526]  Yeah, okay.
[02:55:53.526 --> 02:55:54.567]  First of all, look at J.P.
[02:55:54.567 --> 02:55:54.887]  Morgan.
[02:55:54.887 --> 02:55:56.128]  You have to look at the big picture here.
[02:55:56.128 --> 02:56:02.432]  They've got, on their balance sheet, $93 trillion in derivatives.
[02:56:02.432 --> 02:56:08.996]  Now, to put that into perspective, the total GDP for the world is about $50 trillion.
[02:56:08.996 --> 02:56:16.181]  So they have almost two times the entire output of the entire planet Earth on their books as derivatives board debt.
[02:56:16.926 --> 02:56:22.855]  And a lot of this debt is tied to a massive short position in silver.
[02:56:22.855 --> 02:56:30.185]  By some estimates, 1.5 trillion is exposed in liabilities to their silver short.
[02:56:30.185 --> 02:56:33.009]  So their silver short is the pin in the hand grenade?
[02:56:33.670 --> 02:56:34.691]  Exactly.
[02:56:34.691 --> 02:56:38.454]  And their market capitalization of the company is about $150 billion.
[02:56:38.454 --> 02:56:51.464]  So they've got ten times their entire market capitalization exposed just to their silver short position, which is part of a much bigger $93 trillion derivatives bomb.
[02:56:51.464 --> 02:57:00.792]  So, you know, to pull the pin on the hand grenade, it takes the whole kitten caboodle down, JPMorgan stock goes to zero, and they're out of business, which we want because
[02:57:01.647 --> 02:57:07.308]  They are actively targeting the communities and these countries.
[02:57:07.308 --> 02:57:09.569]  Look at what's happening in Ireland, for example.
[02:57:09.569 --> 02:57:12.169]  The IMF is bankrupt.
[02:57:12.169 --> 02:57:14.150]  The IMF has no money.
[02:57:14.150 --> 02:57:21.192]  They go into Ireland to seize the $20 billion on the Ireland book, plus the pension assets of Ireland.
[02:57:21.192 --> 02:57:22.072]  Ireland's not bankrupt.
[02:57:22.072 --> 02:57:25.393]  They have cash to go for several years without a bailout.
[02:57:25.393 --> 02:57:26.813]  But the IMF is
[02:57:27.714 --> 02:57:42.254]  Yeah, this is a financial takeover and it's not gonna, it's not gonna, I mean if we did bring down JP Morgan, it doesn't mean that exploding battleship might not throw some shrapnel back at us, but it's better than just letting it line up and fire at us forever and not fight back.
[02:57:43.513 --> 02:57:44.294]  Exactly right.
[02:57:44.294 --> 02:57:45.315]  It's all connected.
[02:57:45.315 --> 02:57:47.758]  They're all working with each other.
[02:57:47.758 --> 02:57:49.380]  They're all colluding with each other.
[02:57:49.380 --> 02:57:57.989]  If you take down the biggest guy, you take them all down, and you decapitalize them, you're removing that fiat currency, which is their ammunition.
[02:57:57.989 --> 02:58:03.495]  So you're saying, blow up the Death Star, and you're saying our X-Wings are in there right now, we've got a good chance of blowing it?
[02:58:04.206 --> 02:58:06.247]  Yeah, the Death Star is a good analogy.
[02:58:06.247 --> 02:58:15.813]  I like it because if you remember Luke Skywalker, he's flying into the Death Star and he has to hit the soft spot, that one spot in the Death Star that blows the whole thing up.
[02:58:15.813 --> 02:58:21.496]  In my analysis, if you look at the global banking system, the one soft spot in the entire banking system is J.P.
[02:58:21.496 --> 02:58:23.157]  Morgan's silver short position.
[02:58:23.157 --> 02:58:25.499]  So it's the missing scales on the dragon's belly.
[02:58:26.041 --> 02:58:30.183]  Yeah, if you attack that one spot, you blow up the whole Death Star.
[02:58:30.183 --> 02:58:32.364]  And right now, people understand this.
[02:58:32.364 --> 02:58:34.005]  They instinctively understand it.
[02:58:34.005 --> 02:58:34.705]  Alright, stay there.
[02:58:34.705 --> 02:58:36.826]  We're back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:36.826 --> 02:58:40.028]  Folks, you may have to go to InfoWars.com if your station doesn't carry an InfoWars.com.
[02:58:40.028 --> 02:58:43.329]  Thank you for watching TVN.
[02:58:43.329 --> 02:58:44.970]  Audio streams, folks.
[02:58:44.970 --> 02:58:46.571]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:58:46.571 --> 02:58:47.551]  This is TVN Live.com today.
[02:58:51.104 --> 02:58:55.647]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:58:55.647 --> 02:58:56.568]  Number 1.
[02:58:56.568 --> 02:58:59.991]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:58:59.991 --> 02:59:00.851]  Number 2.
[02:59:00.851 --> 02:59:05.735]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:05.735 --> 02:59:06.495]  It's true.
[02:59:06.495 --> 02:59:11.359]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:11.359 --> 02:59:12.180]  Number 3.
[02:59:12.180 --> 02:59:15.762]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:59:15.762 --> 02:59:19.465]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:59:19.665 --> 02:59:20.465]  Number 4.
[02:59:20.465 --> 02:59:23.226]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:59:23.226 --> 02:59:26.907]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:59:26.907 --> 02:59:27.687]  Number 5.
[02:59:27.687 --> 02:59:31.848]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:59:31.848 --> 02:59:36.890]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:59:36.890 --> 02:59:41.071]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:41.071 --> 02:59:42.852]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:59:48.333 --> 02:59:48.914]  877-327-0365.
[02:59:48.914 --> 02:59:53.598]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:53.598 --> 02:59:55.660]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.660 --> 02:59:58.863]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:12.125 --> 03:00:13.786]  Alright, we're now into overdrive.
[03:00:13.786 --> 03:00:18.748]  It is the second day of December 2010 on this December transmission.
[03:00:18.748 --> 03:00:19.509]  It is Thursday.
[03:00:19.509 --> 03:00:21.269]  Max Keiser is our guest.
[03:00:21.269 --> 03:00:25.972]  Websites are maxkeiser.com, infowars.com, prisonplanet.tv.
[03:00:25.972 --> 03:00:30.454]  The ongoing TSA rout of the Globalist is continuing.
[03:00:30.454 --> 03:00:32.875]  They've backed off on pilots, small children.
[03:00:32.875 --> 03:00:36.277]  Now they're talking about backing off, groping the rest of us.
[03:00:36.277 --> 03:00:38.498]  Undoubtedly the feds will put a bomb on a plane and blow it up.
[03:00:39.258 --> 03:00:44.821]  But we're countering that offensive by exposing who's behind the terror attacks.
[03:00:44.821 --> 03:00:55.708]  Max Keiser's picked up on a grassroots movement a month ago or so to short circuit the shorting of silver by JP Morgan, their naked shorting.
[03:00:55.708 --> 03:00:57.429]  That is now in the London Guardian.
[03:00:57.429 --> 03:01:00.311]  Silver's up 9% in the last month.
[03:01:00.311 --> 03:01:01.672]  The supply is dwindling.
[03:01:01.672 --> 03:01:06.955]  Even mainline analysts are saying this is the Achilles heel, the soft spot on the dragon's belly.
[03:01:11.050 --> 03:01:15.134]  Unshielded exhaust port on the Death Star.
[03:01:15.134 --> 03:01:16.875]  Whatever you want to call it.
[03:01:16.875 --> 03:01:18.516]  It's the sweet spot.
[03:01:18.516 --> 03:01:19.978]  And I was talking to Max during the break.
[03:01:19.978 --> 03:01:23.020]  He was telling me this is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[03:01:23.020 --> 03:01:33.349]  The Hunt brothers were billionaires, but they had no power compared to millions of people going out and buying silver and taking physical possession.
[03:01:33.349 --> 03:01:34.390]  Please continue, Kaiser.
[03:01:35.359 --> 03:01:36.921]  Right, it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[03:01:36.921 --> 03:01:38.883]  It's a virtuous circle.
[03:01:38.883 --> 03:01:45.470]  The more people participate in this, the higher the price goes, and the more people will therefore participate in this.
[03:01:45.470 --> 03:01:49.173]  They can't take sacred stores of silver and dump it to try to knock it down?
[03:01:49.173 --> 03:01:52.377]  Well, the answer is, even if they did that, it would beachball back up, correct?
[03:01:53.137 --> 03:01:56.819]  Well, the only thing they can use to knock it down is paper silver.
[03:01:56.819 --> 03:02:01.221]  But yet, at this point, all the new paper being generated is creating inflation.
[03:02:01.221 --> 03:02:02.281]  You see that right now.
[03:02:02.281 --> 03:02:04.462]  It's hitting and surging.
[03:02:04.462 --> 03:02:05.883]  Which drives up the silver again.
[03:02:06.627 --> 03:02:07.367]  Exactly.
[03:02:07.367 --> 03:02:11.970]  So, the more they try to attack it with paper silver, the higher the price of silver goes.
[03:02:11.970 --> 03:02:13.090]  We've got them in a corner.
[03:02:13.090 --> 03:02:30.258]  Well, for the first time in foreseeable memory, and I'm talking to coin shops, I'm talking to people on the ground, I'm talking to Ted and other brokers, I'm making phone calls about this last month, we see gold and silver versus what the public price is pulling away in the real world for what it sells and running out.
[03:02:30.258 --> 03:02:33.440]  That looks like we could be entering a zone where it really explodes in price.
[03:02:34.827 --> 03:02:36.409]  Yeah, there's scarcity.
[03:02:36.409 --> 03:02:37.791]  There is silver scarcity.
[03:02:37.791 --> 03:02:43.137]  And any time you introduce scarcity into a market, the price discovery mechanism kicks in.
[03:02:43.137 --> 03:02:43.998]  Supply and demand.
[03:02:43.998 --> 03:02:48.824]  That's a higher price.
[03:02:48.824 --> 03:02:49.705]  So... Hello?
[03:02:49.705 --> 03:02:50.786]  Yeah, no, I'm listening to you.
[03:02:50.786 --> 03:02:52.749]  So where do you expect this to go in the near term?
[03:02:54.332 --> 03:03:08.921]  Well, it just keeps going higher because you've got massive buyers and very little supply, and as we've said, the only way to stop it is by throwing more paper at it, but that only encourages people to buy more physical.
[03:03:08.921 --> 03:03:11.842]  So we've got them by their short hair.
[03:03:11.842 --> 03:03:13.744]  There's nothing they can do to defend themselves here.
[03:03:13.744 --> 03:03:15.965]  They can keep throwing paper at it.
[03:03:15.965 --> 03:03:22.669]  They can keep settling contracts with paper, but that paper is inflating the system and increasing the purchasing power of the existing silver.
[03:03:23.529 --> 03:03:28.352]  Now, $500 silver is a doable target.
[03:03:28.352 --> 03:03:52.767]  If this thing continues to go on a global scale, and you've got, and I'm getting videos from all over the world, people are participating in this all over the world, so that $500 target is doable, that means that the Bankers Fiat paper, which is Castle, has collapsed, and everyone is sitting there with real money to have a real economy and a real democracy with.
[03:03:54.304 --> 03:04:00.689]  As the Founding Fathers stated in the Constitution, there shall be no money recognized other than gold and silver.
[03:04:00.689 --> 03:04:02.971]  It's a constitutional mandate.
[03:04:02.971 --> 03:04:06.133]  The fact that there's fiat paper today is unconstitutional.
[03:04:06.133 --> 03:04:10.817]  The Founding Fathers figured this out 150, 200 years ago.
[03:04:10.817 --> 03:04:16.081]  They knew that if you let banks create fiat money that they will use that fiat money to
[03:04:16.201 --> 03:04:16.922]  We're good.
[03:04:33.214 --> 03:04:40.077]  The global banking cartel is everywhere, and now this is a global effort to take back people's wealth.
[03:04:40.077 --> 03:04:48.861]  And by buying silver, by exchanging the slave currencies of the dollar, pound, euro, and yen, and others for real money, you are freeing yourself.
[03:04:48.861 --> 03:04:51.142]  You are freeing... Alright, Max, stay there.
[03:04:51.142 --> 03:04:51.983]  Come back.
[03:04:51.983 --> 03:04:52.963]  Take phone calls.
[03:04:52.963 --> 03:04:55.364]  Chris, Ed, Julio, Tim, Mark, and many others.
[03:04:55.364 --> 03:04:55.424]  800-259-9231.
[03:04:55.424 --> 03:04:57.805]  These are interesting times we're living in.
[03:04:57.805 --> 03:04:59.046]  Stay with us.
[03:05:02.952 --> 03:05:06.536]  If you owe money to the IRS, you can't make the problem go away by yourself.

[03:06:01.089 --> 03:06:06.053]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:06:06.053 --> 03:06:07.054]  What have we got?
[03:06:07.054 --> 03:06:09.497]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:06:09.497 --> 03:06:10.517]  A republic.
[03:06:10.517 --> 03:06:13.160]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[03:06:13.160 --> 03:06:15.422]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[03:06:15.422 --> 03:06:17.444]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:06:17.444 --> 03:06:19.125]  So they think they own our land?
[03:06:19.125 --> 03:06:20.446]  They think they own our water?
[03:06:20.446 --> 03:06:21.047]  Children?
[03:06:21.047 --> 03:06:22.168]  Our education?
[03:06:22.168 --> 03:06:22.989]  Our money?
[03:06:22.989 --> 03:06:26.672]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:06:27.012 --> 03:06:30.716]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[03:06:30.716 --> 03:06:31.978]  You're being warned.
[03:06:31.978 --> 03:06:32.999]  We have the facts.
[03:06:32.999 --> 03:06:34.160]  We have the Constitution.
[03:06:34.160 --> 03:06:35.081]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[03:06:35.081 --> 03:06:35.962]  We have common law.
[03:06:35.962 --> 03:06:38.485]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:06:38.485 --> 03:06:42.269]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[03:06:42.369 --> 03:06:47.330]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[03:06:47.330 --> 03:06:48.831]  A new tool in the Info War.
[03:06:48.831 --> 03:06:49.911]  Don't tread on me.
[03:06:49.911 --> 03:06:56.773]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[03:07:00.805 --> 03:07:02.006]  Got a light, Jessica?
[03:07:02.006 --> 03:07:02.527]  Nope.
[03:07:02.527 --> 03:07:03.368]  But you're smoking.
[03:07:03.368 --> 03:07:04.549]  I don't need a light.
[03:07:04.549 --> 03:07:06.752]  It's a Smoke Genie electronic cigarette.
[03:07:06.752 --> 03:07:07.092]  Really?
[03:07:07.092 --> 03:07:08.614]  You haven't tried them?
[03:07:08.614 --> 03:07:11.036]  It's just like the real thing, but better.
[03:07:11.036 --> 03:07:12.238]  It's so much cheaper.
[03:07:12.238 --> 03:07:16.923]  There's no tar and burning, and you can take just a few puffs and put it right back in your purse.
[03:07:16.923 --> 03:07:19.886]  You can even smoke one of these where regular cigarettes are banned.
[03:07:20.186 --> 03:07:21.007]  Seriously?
[03:07:21.007 --> 03:07:24.129]  I'm sick of people telling me where I can and can't smoke.
[03:07:24.129 --> 03:07:25.090]  I tell ya, it's great.
[03:07:25.090 --> 03:07:30.974]  There's a bunch of them out there, but Smoke Genie is way superior in flavor, quality, shipping, and customer service.
[03:07:31.442 --> 03:07:32.222]  I don't know.
[03:07:32.222 --> 03:07:34.343]  I've been smoking cigarettes forever.
[03:07:34.343 --> 03:07:35.923]  Not sure I could change.
[03:07:35.923 --> 03:07:39.223]  Listen, there's a 30-day no-questions-asked money-back guarantee.
[03:07:39.223 --> 03:07:40.824]  You've got nothing to lose.
[03:07:40.824 --> 03:07:42.864]  I wish they had Smoke Genie 10 years ago.
[03:07:42.864 --> 03:07:44.524]  I would have saved a ton of money.
[03:07:44.524 --> 03:07:46.965]  And my clothes don't smell like smoke anymore.
[03:07:46.965 --> 03:07:47.385]  Really?
[03:07:47.385 --> 03:07:48.705]  That's great!
[03:07:48.705 --> 03:07:51.025]  And Smoke Genie even has next-day delivery.

[03:07:59.667 --> 03:07:59.987]  I'm in!
[03:08:04.810 --> 03:08:05.811]  Big Brother.
[03:08:05.811 --> 03:08:07.472]  Mainstream media.
[03:08:07.472 --> 03:08:08.853]  Government cover-ups.
[03:08:08.853 --> 03:08:10.154]  You want answers?
[03:08:10.154 --> 03:08:12.195]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:12.195 --> 03:08:22.483]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:22.483 --> 03:08:27.547]  I shot a video with Aaron last night titled, It's the Bankers or Us.
[03:08:29.966 --> 03:08:32.548]  And it's an article explaining that they will give us no quarter.
[03:08:32.548 --> 03:08:35.811]  They will rape and rob everything, the big six megabanks.
[03:08:35.811 --> 03:08:38.773]  Lord Monckton agreed, member of the House of Lords.
[03:08:38.773 --> 03:08:39.754]  Ron Paul agrees.
[03:08:39.754 --> 03:08:40.875]  I mean, this is our enemy.
[03:08:40.875 --> 03:08:42.656]  This is the global government.
[03:08:42.656 --> 03:08:43.357]  Well, you did it.
[03:08:43.357 --> 03:08:47.540]  You made it the number one Google search term, bankers or us.
[03:08:47.540 --> 03:08:54.346]  And I'd say about half the links, when you click on it, are to sites that mirrored our article and our video.
[03:08:54.346 --> 03:08:59.089]  But I would suggest all other websites out there, this will be the top search term for much of the day,
[03:09:00.071 --> 03:09:07.956]  Take our article or write your own article about it's the bankers or us, so your site gets the massive traffic and exposing the globalists.
[03:09:07.956 --> 03:09:15.060]  Google may have blocked me from Google News as punishment for the Google bombs and the TSA.
[03:09:15.060 --> 03:09:16.300]  I don't care.
[03:09:16.300 --> 03:09:18.742]  There's more than one way to skin a cat.
[03:09:18.742 --> 03:09:24.385]  So when you hear us do a search term, you better take our articles and put it on your own site or news site.
[03:09:24.385 --> 03:09:25.326]  Bankers or us,
[03:09:26.426 --> 03:09:28.708]  Number one volcanic search.
[03:09:28.708 --> 03:09:31.549]  We have the number one, number two, and number three yesterday.
[03:09:31.549 --> 03:09:33.311]  Great job listeners.
[03:09:33.311 --> 03:09:34.812]  So there you have it Max Keiser.
[03:09:34.812 --> 03:09:37.794]  They are certainly getting upset about what we're doing.
[03:09:37.794 --> 03:09:39.515]  Right, well it's an information war.
[03:09:39.515 --> 03:09:42.176]  And they have their algorithms, and you have your listeners.
[03:09:42.176 --> 03:09:42.677]  And it's a war.
[03:09:44.500 --> 03:09:46.900]  Well, I salute our frontline soldiers out there.
[03:09:46.900 --> 03:09:53.822]  I'm looking at my site right now, MaxGeiser.com, K-E-I-S-E-R.
[03:09:53.822 --> 03:09:56.162]  There's a great photo that somebody sent me.
[03:09:56.162 --> 03:10:00.923]  It's a photoshopped version of a very famous Times Square photo.
[03:10:00.923 --> 03:10:09.924]  If you go back in the 60s, John Lennon and Yoko Ono took out big billboards in Times Square that said, War is over, if you want it.
[03:10:09.924 --> 03:10:12.585]  And somebody sent me a photoshopped version of it that says, $500 silver,
[03:10:14.245 --> 03:10:15.525]  If you want it.
[03:10:15.525 --> 03:10:18.406]  And that really gets to the message here.
[03:10:18.406 --> 03:10:23.308]  If people around the world want $500 silver, that's exactly what they'll get.
[03:10:23.308 --> 03:10:27.549]  Because all they have to do is go out and buy a couple of ounces of silver, and they'll get $500 silver.
[03:10:27.549 --> 03:10:36.772]  This is a mass global movement to stop the terrorists, just like back in the 60s, you had a mass movement to stop the Vietnam War.
[03:10:36.772 --> 03:10:40.013]  This is a mass movement to stop these financial banking terrorists.
[03:10:40.013 --> 03:10:40.734]  Max, I agree.
[03:10:42.234 --> 03:10:58.918]  I want to get to some calls before we've got to end this overdrive transmission, but in your estimations and the estimations that have been done by major economists that you mentioned last hour, how much silver, physical silver, has got to be purchased to guaranteed annihilate the bankers?
[03:11:00.111 --> 03:11:04.537]  Well, the supply is about 100 million ounces a year.
[03:11:04.537 --> 03:11:09.924]  So, you know, it's not really... And the industrial use is something like 700 million ounces a year.
[03:11:09.924 --> 03:11:18.395]  So there's already huge silver shortages right now, plus the hedge funds are our partner in this, and they're buying silver in billion-dollar quantities.
[03:11:18.895 --> 03:11:21.757]  So there's already, the hedge funds are going to make this happen anyway.
[03:11:21.757 --> 03:11:31.722]  So I'm telling you, the person who can only buy one or two coins, get in now, because the hedge funds are buying a billion at a clip, are making this happen right now.
[03:11:31.722 --> 03:11:34.023]  So it's, the shortages are right now.
[03:11:34.023 --> 03:11:43.329]  And you made the point, you made the point three weeks ago, here on the show, that as we drive this up, the greedy globalists, they're all going to join in and destroy themselves.
[03:11:43.329 --> 03:11:43.889]  They can't help it.
[03:11:46.278 --> 03:11:53.484]  Yeah, they're opportunists, but that works in our favor because then we've got leverage against them.
[03:11:53.484 --> 03:11:57.488]  They'll throw out their JP Morgan buddies at the drop of a hat.
[03:11:57.488 --> 03:12:05.214]  You know, they're not going to sit in a bunker and get destroyed with the balance sheet of JP Morgan and their banking buddies.
[03:12:05.214 --> 03:12:06.115]  They're going to change.
[03:12:06.115 --> 03:12:08.397]  They're going to be joining our forces.
[03:12:08.397 --> 03:12:09.318]  We're going to convert them.
[03:12:09.318 --> 03:12:10.359]  We're converting them every day.
[03:12:11.678 --> 03:12:23.466]  It's by deploying the renaissance, by leading, like our guest said yesterday, shooting our grappling hook over the parapet and hauling ourselves up above the globalists, leading by example.
[03:12:23.466 --> 03:12:24.787]  That's Max Keiser.
[03:12:24.787 --> 03:12:26.028]  It's like Pac-Man.
[03:12:26.028 --> 03:12:30.391]  You know, Pac-Man, when you gobble up one of the little things in the Pac-Man, he becomes part of your forces.
[03:12:31.051 --> 03:12:34.172]  Every time it goes higher, more of the globalists switch sides.
[03:12:34.172 --> 03:12:37.053]  Because they don't want to get in front of this freight train and get killed.
[03:12:37.053 --> 03:12:40.114]  They're like, silver's going to 500, I'm getting into silver.
[03:12:40.114 --> 03:12:42.355]  They're converting and they're joining the forces.
[03:12:42.355 --> 03:12:44.396]  Alright, let's take phone calls here, we've got to hurry.
[03:12:44.396 --> 03:12:46.657]  Chris in Nevada, you're on the air with Max Keiser, go ahead.
[03:12:46.657 --> 03:12:48.758]  Alright, how you doing Alex?
[03:12:48.758 --> 03:12:49.358]  Good, go ahead.
[03:12:50.438 --> 03:12:51.119]  Good.
[03:12:51.119 --> 03:12:52.041]  I got a question.
[03:12:52.041 --> 03:13:03.720]  You guys are saying if you take 20% of JP Chase's mortgage, or these six big banks, take their money out and bank locally, or buy silver, the big bank crashes, right?
[03:13:03.720 --> 03:13:03.920]  Yes.
[03:13:04.911 --> 03:13:05.712]  Okay, okay.
[03:13:05.712 --> 03:13:12.477]  What happens to the other 80% of people and their money that are, you know, haven't taken it out or bought any silver?
[03:13:12.477 --> 03:13:14.839]  Well, the bankers are already debasing the dollar.
[03:13:14.839 --> 03:13:15.780]  They're already debasing.
[03:13:15.780 --> 03:13:23.446]  They're already in a predatory takeover, so if they're going to take us down, we're going to take them down.
[03:13:23.446 --> 03:13:26.769]  Yeah, and I got another point.
[03:13:26.769 --> 03:13:30.492]  As far as, like, buying silver, I find that a great idea for everybody to start doing.
[03:13:30.916 --> 03:13:49.667]  But for people like myself who generally live like day-to-day, as far as like the money we receive, you know, through paycheck to paycheck to paycheck, like if I buy silver myself, I can't necessarily like buy my nightly meals or pay my water bill with silver, so like, it's... Alright, Chris, I get this all the time, and I appreciate your call.
[03:13:49.667 --> 03:13:50.988]  Let me briefly answer it.
[03:13:50.988 --> 03:13:55.431]  Get a 30-second answer from Max, because I gotta go, you know, to the other callers here.
[03:13:55.431 --> 03:13:59.453]  If you... Okay, Max, let me answer, because this is important.
[03:13:59.453 --> 03:14:00.574]  Okay, this is elementary.
[03:14:02.759 --> 03:14:06.863]  Fourteen years ago, when I was promoting silver, it was like $5 an ounce.
[03:14:06.863 --> 03:14:08.645]  Now it's $29.
[03:14:08.645 --> 03:14:11.669]  So, if you're a poor person, but you bought it when it was $5...
[03:14:13.703 --> 03:14:17.305]  Now today, you could sell that silver and pay your electric bill.
[03:14:17.305 --> 03:14:22.609]  If you keep the dollars, they're being devalued while the silver is going up.
[03:14:22.609 --> 03:14:27.812]  So it is the poor man's gold, and so it doesn't mean you've gotta buy a bunch of silver.
[03:14:27.812 --> 03:14:36.658]  I mean, we're just here discussing, look, why did I believe in gold and silver when gold was 260 an ounce, or 265 an ounce, and silver was $5 an ounce?
[03:14:36.658 --> 03:14:40.320]  Because I'd studied history, and I knew what debasing currencies did,
[03:14:40.560 --> 03:14:41.701]  Anybody has 28 bucks to buy a coin.
[03:15:00.919 --> 03:15:04.581]  Even people, homeless people, have 28 bucks to buy a coin.
[03:15:04.581 --> 03:15:07.343]  And remember Gandhi and his march to the sea?
[03:15:07.343 --> 03:15:12.306]  As he got closer to the sea, the people following him turned into millions.
[03:15:12.306 --> 03:15:13.867]  And what did he do when he got to the sea?
[03:15:13.867 --> 03:15:16.669]  He simply reached in and pulled a handful of salt.
[03:15:16.669 --> 03:15:17.709]  That's all he did.
[03:15:17.709 --> 03:15:20.911]  And that's all it would took to annihilate the British Empire.
[03:15:20.911 --> 03:15:26.475]  Because there was a tax, the British had a monopoly on salt, and his joke was, it's everywhere.
[03:15:27.031 --> 03:15:28.191]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:15:28.191 --> 03:15:35.014]  Now, fiat currencies is the new imperial way to keep us locked up in prison.
[03:15:35.014 --> 03:15:42.617]  And by buying one little silver coin, or even a half a silver coin, or a quarter of a silver coin, or a little silver trinket, you are now part of the movement.
[03:15:42.617 --> 03:15:44.158]  You are part of the revolution.
[03:15:44.158 --> 03:15:47.339]  You've got that silver bullet aimed at the heart of JPMorgan.
[03:15:47.339 --> 03:15:51.521]  You are now part of the global insurrection against banking occupation.
[03:15:51.521 --> 03:15:56.043]  You could do it for ten bucks, and nobody in your listening audience right now, you know,
[03:15:57.363 --> 03:15:57.984]  No, I hear you.
[03:15:57.984 --> 03:15:59.105]  Let's go to Ed.
[03:15:59.105 --> 03:16:00.386]  Let's go to Ed in Hawaii.
[03:16:00.386 --> 03:16:01.087]  Ed, you're on the air.
[03:16:01.087 --> 03:16:01.507]  Go ahead.
[03:16:01.507 --> 03:16:03.089]  Hi, Alex.
[03:16:03.089 --> 03:16:03.870]  Hi, Alex.
[03:16:03.870 --> 03:16:04.290]  Hey, buddy.
[03:16:04.290 --> 03:16:04.851]  Alex?
[03:16:04.851 --> 03:16:05.191]  Yeah.
[03:16:05.191 --> 03:16:06.072]  Alex, yes.
[03:16:06.072 --> 03:16:07.593]  First time caller.
[03:16:07.593 --> 03:16:13.920]  I've been investing in silver for probably eight years, reading on the subject for many years.
[03:16:13.920 --> 03:16:21.387]  One of the things I'd say to the last caller is, and I've had this idea before about the silver to take it down, these power mongers.
[03:16:23.304 --> 03:16:28.528]  Go start buying one 90% silver dime or one 90% silver quarter.
[03:16:28.528 --> 03:16:30.709]  Those are like $2 to $5.
[03:16:30.709 --> 03:16:36.713]  And there's nothing like starting to buy real silver.
[03:16:36.713 --> 03:16:38.554]  It's a great thing to do.
[03:16:38.554 --> 03:16:47.401]  On the Hunt brothers, one of the things I read about him is that he was a true believer the dollar was going to crash.
[03:16:47.401 --> 03:16:49.422]  I think to a certain extent he saw himself as a
[03:16:50.015 --> 03:16:56.658]  of battling the Federal Reserve, just like... No, that's what the Hunts said.
[03:16:56.658 --> 03:16:57.378]  We're almost out of time.
[03:16:57.378 --> 03:16:59.519]  Do you have a question for our guest?
[03:16:59.519 --> 03:17:02.741]  Well, I'd just say, actually, just take J.P.
[03:17:02.741 --> 03:17:03.261]  Morgan down.
[03:17:03.261 --> 03:17:05.102]  I totally agree.
[03:17:05.102 --> 03:17:05.962]  Thank you.
[03:17:05.962 --> 03:17:06.743]  All right.
[03:17:06.743 --> 03:17:08.023]  Thank you so much, sir.
[03:17:08.023 --> 03:17:09.004]  Julio in Illinois.
[03:17:09.004 --> 03:17:09.364]  Go ahead.
[03:17:11.107 --> 03:17:12.267]  Gentlemen, good afternoon.
[03:17:12.267 --> 03:17:14.248]  Max, I appreciate what you're doing.
[03:17:14.248 --> 03:17:15.708]  Two quick questions.
[03:17:15.708 --> 03:17:24.510]  First off, how important do you feel, you just mentioned earlier about, you know, it's a Constitution-based currency, gold and silver, like our founding father state.
[03:17:24.510 --> 03:17:32.052]  How important is it to tell people who aren't awake about Executive Order 11110 from 63, coincidentally enough, five months later,
[03:17:35.194 --> 03:17:35.594]  That's right.
[03:17:35.594 --> 03:17:40.242]  Kennedy didn't just start getting us out of Vietnam or have the real civil rights movement.
[03:17:40.242 --> 03:17:43.447]  He started the movement to abolish the Federal Reserve and have the U.S.
[03:17:43.447 --> 03:17:47.453]  government issue its own currency, not the private Federal Reserve, and they blew his head off.
[03:17:47.453 --> 03:17:48.675]  Comments on that, Max Keiser.
[03:17:49.983 --> 03:17:52.425]  Well, I mean, yeah, that's a good part of the history of it.
[03:17:52.425 --> 03:17:57.610]  That executive order was going to abolish the Fed and the rest of history.
[03:17:57.610 --> 03:18:00.253]  So, yeah, that's how powerful this is.
[03:18:00.253 --> 03:18:03.956]  But, you see, it's not about one man with one executive order.
[03:18:03.956 --> 03:18:07.760]  It's about 100 million people around the world each buying one silver out.
[03:18:08.342 --> 03:18:22.020]  Yeah, well I'll tell you this Max, you've got a lot of nerve, because being at the head of pushing this, let me tell you, if you are successful, this mafia I'd imagine is going to send a hit team over to your house, and I'm serious.
[03:18:22.020 --> 03:18:23.462]  As I said before,
[03:18:25.604 --> 03:18:36.366]  I'm converting people en masse, and for every person that's upset at this, there are ten people that are kissing my cheek and thanking me.
[03:18:36.366 --> 03:18:49.449]  So I am putting the proverbial flowers into the muzzle of the gun on the front line, and I'm turning the criminals into silver-loving, free-market, real constitutionalists.
[03:18:49.449 --> 03:18:50.789]  That's been one of the best things that's ever happened.
[03:18:50.789 --> 03:18:51.189]  No, I understand, Max.
[03:18:51.189 --> 03:18:52.650]  You're a true revolutionary.
[03:18:52.650 --> 03:18:53.490]  We're all here together.
[03:18:54.230 --> 03:18:57.411]  Hurdling into the future, this is very exciting.
[03:18:57.411 --> 03:18:58.651]  Thank you so much, Julio.
[03:18:58.651 --> 03:19:01.272]  Tim in Michigan, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:19:01.272 --> 03:19:01.992]  Alex!
[03:19:01.992 --> 03:19:03.133]  Hey!
[03:19:03.133 --> 03:19:04.153]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[03:19:04.153 --> 03:19:05.273]  Good!
[03:19:05.273 --> 03:19:09.174]  This is your search term, Tim, from Michigan.
[03:19:09.174 --> 03:19:15.676]  If you remember... The guy that called six, eight months ago, or however long ago it was, with the idea for search terms, yes.
[03:19:15.676 --> 03:19:16.836]  Yes, sir, that's me.
[03:19:16.836 --> 03:19:22.098]  Listen, Alex, I'm on disability, and I have 13 ounces of silver,
[03:19:22.725 --> 03:19:31.367]  I have a $5 silver certificate that I purchased in remembrance of Mr. Kennedy, and I also have three British Sovereigns.
[03:19:31.367 --> 03:19:34.987]  And I'm on disability, getting roughly $1,000 a month.
[03:19:34.987 --> 03:19:41.869]  So if these people try to say that they can't afford to do this, it's because they have their priorities in the wrong place.
[03:19:41.869 --> 03:19:46.849]  And this is very possible, because I also have a dollar certificate, silver certificate.
[03:19:46.849 --> 03:19:48.650]  I understand they're not retainable anymore.
[03:19:49.912 --> 03:20:03.658]  These were done in more of a remembrance for JFK, and my condolences for him, and I do have a 1963 $5 silver certificate, which was purchased just for that reason.
[03:20:03.658 --> 03:20:15.464]  I also have a Lone Star nickel, which is a 2-ounce silver round, and I have another 11 different rounds that I had purchased.
[03:20:15.464 --> 03:20:15.864]  Beautiful!
[03:20:15.864 --> 03:20:17.385]  Do you have a question for Max Keiser?
[03:20:18.072 --> 03:20:20.475]  Yes, I do.
[03:20:20.475 --> 03:20:39.436]  My question to Max is, also I want to tell you that I'm very inspired by his initiative to set this off, and my question is this, that Max, that if somebody like me on such a limited income can afford to have three quarters of an ounce of gold,
[03:20:43.857 --> 03:20:45.377]  I understand your question.
[03:20:45.377 --> 03:20:46.738]  We're almost out of time.
[03:20:46.738 --> 03:20:53.160]  It's because they don't believe they can win, or they don't understand that silver and gold isn't going up.
[03:20:53.160 --> 03:20:57.122]  The currency is being devalued.
[03:20:57.122 --> 03:20:59.043]  Max, your comment on that?
[03:20:59.775 --> 03:21:02.355]  My comment is that I agree with you.
[03:21:02.355 --> 03:21:05.636]  People don't think that they can win anymore.
[03:21:05.636 --> 03:21:06.756]  They've been beaten down.
[03:21:06.756 --> 03:21:15.138]  But the beautiful thing about this campaign is that once people put a silver coin in their hand, a little bell goes off on their head and they go, and they realize, my God, this is money!
[03:21:15.138 --> 03:21:17.138]  This is what the economy should have been based on.
[03:21:17.138 --> 03:21:18.439]  This is what it says in the Constitution.
[03:21:18.439 --> 03:21:21.939]  This isn't some dirty, dirty, dirty piece of paper.
[03:21:21.939 --> 03:21:22.719]  This is real.
[03:21:22.719 --> 03:21:23.660]  This is heavy.
[03:21:23.660 --> 03:21:25.060]  Boy, they like silver in their hand.
[03:21:25.060 --> 03:21:25.840]  They ought to try gold.
[03:21:26.380 --> 03:21:28.662]  It's psychological alchemy.
[03:21:28.662 --> 03:21:32.045]  You turn your defeatism into an attitude of winning.
[03:21:32.045 --> 03:21:41.333]  Because you realize, my God, I'm part of a movement that's going to transform this fiat money, tax, or reserve system into an honest economy that's democratic.
[03:21:41.333 --> 03:21:43.215]  Let's talk to Mark in North Carolina.
[03:21:43.215 --> 03:21:44.756]  Mark, you're on the air.
[03:21:44.756 --> 03:21:45.336]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:21:45.336 --> 03:21:45.957]  Hey, Max.
[03:21:45.957 --> 03:21:46.637]  Hey, Alex.
[03:21:46.637 --> 03:21:51.141]  In an effort to be brief, I'll ask my question and take my answer offline.
[03:21:51.141 --> 03:21:52.923]  This may be of interest to the fellow that just called.
[03:21:53.436 --> 03:22:08.464]  If someone is disabled, say they've worked 27 years in the same job and they're disabled and they're collecting disability and they're on Medicare, if they've got their 401k or their IRA and they wish to convert to silver, is there a way that they could do so without being penalized?
[03:22:08.464 --> 03:22:11.626]  Not so much in the taxes, we know how that goes, but with regard to
[03:22:12.381 --> 03:22:15.004]  Not losing your eligibility for Medicare if they wanted to convert.
[03:22:32.623 --> 03:22:33.584]  Hi Alex and Max.
[03:22:33.584 --> 03:22:34.685]  I have a question.
[03:22:34.685 --> 03:22:36.947]  If JP Morgan goes down, would that trigger a bailout
[03:23:02.043 --> 03:23:05.808]  Another bailout, and if so, what would be the bottom line and ramifications?
[03:23:05.808 --> 03:23:08.791]  Well, that would devalue currency more and gold and silver would go up even more.
[03:23:08.791 --> 03:23:10.333]  Max Keiser?
[03:23:10.333 --> 03:23:11.134]  That's right.
[03:23:11.134 --> 03:23:12.295]  They're being bailed out anyway.
[03:23:12.295 --> 03:23:13.557]  The bailouts are continuing.
[03:23:13.557 --> 03:23:14.758]  Yeah, these aren't even bailouts.
[03:23:14.758 --> 03:23:18.743]  These are them taking over countries and robbing everything.
[03:23:18.743 --> 03:23:19.944]  They're not going to stop.
[03:23:19.944 --> 03:23:20.505]  They hate us.
[03:23:21.155 --> 03:23:23.837]  Yeah, the value of paper money is continuing to collapse.
[03:23:23.837 --> 03:23:31.362]  So, another benefit is that you're going to have actual money in your pocket and the purchasing power will continue to go up.
[03:23:31.362 --> 03:23:32.983]  Again, it's a win-win-win situation.
[03:23:52.755 --> 03:23:55.556]  Yeah, they can't appease terrorists.
[03:23:55.556 --> 03:24:00.698]  And simply by saying, well, if it collapses, then they might come after me and abuse me some more.
[03:24:00.698 --> 03:24:02.178]  That's not a good enough answer.
[03:24:02.178 --> 03:24:07.699]  At some point, we've got to stand up and say, we want real money, we want a democracy, we want to get rid of financial terrorists.
[03:24:07.699 --> 03:24:09.680]  JPMorgan is the worst of the lot.
[03:24:09.680 --> 03:24:12.581]  Let's take it down and see where we go from there.
[03:24:12.581 --> 03:24:15.101]  Okay, Nancy, does that answer your question?
[03:24:15.101 --> 03:24:16.462]  Well, I'm just wondering.
[03:24:18.206 --> 03:24:19.968]  If they bailed out J.P.
[03:24:19.968 --> 03:24:21.389]  Morgan, they wouldn't be going down.
[03:24:21.389 --> 03:24:24.511]  Yeah, but they would bail out with paper.
[03:24:24.511 --> 03:24:27.313]  That's the only thing they have to bail them out with.
[03:24:27.313 --> 03:24:29.956]  That means that the purchasing power of their store goes up.
[03:24:29.956 --> 03:24:37.321]  Nancy, Nancy, if you expose the fiat currency with gold and silver, there's a war going on between real money and fiat.
[03:24:37.321 --> 03:24:39.543]  The globalists get their power from fiat.
[03:24:39.543 --> 03:24:41.725]  You take away their power.
[03:24:41.725 --> 03:24:43.426]  It's over for them.
[03:24:43.426 --> 03:24:46.189]  We blew up their carbon tax stuff last year.
[03:24:47.089 --> 03:24:48.650]  Listen, listen, listen.
[03:24:48.650 --> 03:24:54.915]  Remember last year on this show, due to our conversations, we shut down the cancer exchange.
[03:24:54.915 --> 03:24:57.536]  Remember Carol Fitzgerald was going to do box office future?
[03:24:57.536 --> 03:25:01.339]  They shut it down based on what we were saying on this show.
[03:25:01.339 --> 03:25:02.700]  Nancy, I appreciate your call.
[03:25:02.700 --> 03:25:07.824]  All I know is resistance is victory, and a fight's always messy, and that's the end of it.
[03:25:08.769 --> 03:25:10.170]  You gotta decide what side you're on.
[03:25:10.170 --> 03:25:16.072]  Are you for fiat currency that empowers the globalist, or are you with George Washington and gold and silver?
[03:25:16.072 --> 03:25:19.633]  Max Keiser will obviously have you up very soon as this develops and unfolds.
[03:25:19.633 --> 03:25:21.554]  When's your regular monthly visit scheduled?
[03:25:21.554 --> 03:25:22.515]  Isn't it next week?
[03:25:22.515 --> 03:25:23.635]  God bless you, Max Keiser.
[03:25:23.635 --> 03:25:24.595]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[03:25:24.595 --> 03:25:25.296]  Bye.
[03:25:25.296 --> 03:25:27.177]  All right, there he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:25:27.177 --> 03:25:28.577]  History's being made right now.
[03:25:28.577 --> 03:25:30.698]  Again, I promote what I believe in.
[03:25:30.698 --> 03:25:35.200]  I know they're putting uranium and radium in the water.
[03:25:36.607 --> 03:25:38.309]  I say get water filters.
[03:25:38.309 --> 03:25:39.110]  I got sponsors.
[03:25:39.110 --> 03:25:40.311]  They sell filters.
[03:25:40.311 --> 03:25:41.432]  We make money.
[03:25:41.432 --> 03:25:45.777]  I can pay for the office, the operation, and go eat enchiladas if I want.
[03:25:45.777 --> 03:25:47.078]  I sleep good at night.
[03:25:47.078 --> 03:25:49.641]  I promote as a free market person when I believe.
[03:25:49.641 --> 03:25:57.309]  I've been promoting for 15 years, actively 13, gold and silver, and all of them have quadrupled or more in price.
[03:25:58.476 --> 03:25:59.997]  Because I know history.
[03:25:59.997 --> 03:26:07.725]  I know when they start devaluing currencies in Weimar Republic or Zimbabwe or Argentina, gold and silver go up.
[03:26:07.725 --> 03:26:08.726]  Not rocket science.
[03:26:08.726 --> 03:26:10.568]  I'm not a genius.
[03:26:10.568 --> 03:26:11.909]  And it's that.
[03:26:11.909 --> 03:26:13.290]  Now, will they drive it down later?
[03:26:13.290 --> 03:26:14.311]  Will they?
[03:26:14.311 --> 03:26:15.312]  Probably.
[03:26:15.312 --> 03:26:18.195]  But over time, we're only going to win.
[03:26:18.195 --> 03:26:19.076]  Okay?
[03:26:19.076 --> 03:26:20.678]  They've got a lot of tricks up their sleeves.
[03:26:21.636 --> 03:26:24.518]  I don't know how to explain it to people.
[03:26:24.518 --> 03:26:27.540]  Ted Anderson, can you explain it in 30 seconds to them?
[03:26:27.540 --> 03:26:28.081]  Sure I can.
[03:26:28.081 --> 03:26:32.363]  First of all, three silver dollars, three of Alex's best videos, $97 we take credit cards.
[03:26:34.986 --> 03:26:38.469]  Don't complain about not making it easy to buy gold and silver.
[03:26:38.469 --> 03:26:41.391]  Even if you're flat-out broke, you can afford this one.
[03:26:41.391 --> 03:26:44.413]  If you can smoke cigarettes, you can certainly buy silver.
[03:26:44.413 --> 03:26:46.775]  Anyways, yeah, it's as simple as that, Alex.
[03:26:46.775 --> 03:26:50.738]  I mean, you can take down the central banks of the world.
[03:26:50.738 --> 03:26:54.882]  As soon as people refuse to take their printed money, they're done.
[03:26:55.882 --> 03:27:01.028]  You know, they're printing money, they lend it to us, they collect interest on us, they're siphoning away all of our labor.
[03:27:01.028 --> 03:27:04.433]  There's no wonder why people feel like they're broke in this country.
[03:27:04.433 --> 03:27:05.614]  You know, that's what's going on.
[03:27:05.614 --> 03:27:08.418]  And the globalists are just getting started.
[03:27:08.418 --> 03:27:10.540]  But we had a caller calling in asking about...
[03:27:11.161 --> 03:27:13.443]  Putting their 401ks in silver and gold.
[03:27:13.443 --> 03:27:14.724]  I know that you're involved in that.
[03:27:14.724 --> 03:27:15.664]  Others are.
[03:27:15.664 --> 03:27:18.286]  But a lot of folks just take physical delivery.
[03:27:18.286 --> 03:27:23.510]  Do they get a hit with their Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security if they take physical delivery?
[03:27:23.510 --> 03:27:25.632]  My research is only if they sell it, right?
[03:27:25.632 --> 03:27:26.432]  No, that's right.
[03:27:26.432 --> 03:27:28.734]  Because silver and gold grows tax-deferred.
[03:27:28.734 --> 03:27:31.136]  You don't pay taxes on it until you sell it.
[03:27:31.136 --> 03:27:32.297]  And that's if you report it.
[03:27:32.557 --> 03:27:39.802]  That's why they want to pass this health care bill and make everybody file a 1099 form and $600 worth of transaction.
[03:27:39.802 --> 03:27:41.083]  And that's being thrown out.
[03:27:41.083 --> 03:27:42.184]  There's only a few items.
[03:27:42.184 --> 03:27:45.166]  It's the 60-45 revenue ruling that they passed in 1983.
[03:27:45.166 --> 03:27:46.447]  We're running wild!
[03:27:46.447 --> 03:27:47.848]  We're taking the country back!
[03:27:47.848 --> 03:27:49.829]  We're getting rid of the tax increases!
[03:27:49.829 --> 03:27:52.091]  We're getting rid of their scams!
[03:27:52.091 --> 03:27:54.933]  We're probably going to beat the food takeover bill!
[03:27:55.333 --> 03:27:56.133]  We're going nuts!
[03:27:56.133 --> 03:27:57.274]  We're getting angry!
[03:27:57.274 --> 03:27:58.194]  It's fun!
[03:27:58.194 --> 03:28:03.496]  And we're not just running around with a bunch of commies in the streets waving signs so feds can shoot us with rubber bullets.
[03:28:03.496 --> 03:28:05.357]  We're revolting in cyberspace.
[03:28:05.357 --> 03:28:06.817]  We're revolting with money.
[03:28:06.817 --> 03:28:08.898]  We're revolting on the radio.
[03:28:08.898 --> 03:28:11.939]  We're just going wild and it feels good and I love it!
[03:28:11.939 --> 03:28:13.480]  And I'm never gonna stop.
[03:28:13.480 --> 03:28:18.102]  Ted Anderson, tell folks real fast about some of the other gold and silver offers you've got today.
[03:28:18.102 --> 03:28:20.863]  Get involved in the revolution and support our operations.
[03:28:20.863 --> 03:28:21.743]  Give them the number, Ted.
[03:28:21.963 --> 03:28:27.304]  Yeah, well, 1-800-686-2237 is the telephone number.
[03:28:27.304 --> 03:28:30.144]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[03:28:30.144 --> 03:28:34.465]  I mean, come on, Walking Liberty has for $12.84.
[03:28:34.465 --> 03:28:35.926]  You can't afford those?
[03:28:35.926 --> 03:28:39.486]  I mean, like I said, dimes, we carry those, you know, bars of silver.
[03:28:39.486 --> 03:28:41.547]  You don't have to get in with a lot of money.
[03:28:41.547 --> 03:28:43.887]  But I would suggest that you get moving and you get moving now.
[03:28:43.887 --> 03:28:46.507]  And I think what Max is doing is such a great idea.
[03:28:46.507 --> 03:28:48.888]  Finally get the people together to get out of that fiat
[03:28:49.728 --> 03:28:51.350]  Well, that's why I got behind it.
[03:28:51.350 --> 03:28:56.256]  It's a lot better idea to expose the silver fraud than go after Coca-Cola.
[03:28:56.256 --> 03:28:57.317]  It sure is.
[03:28:57.317 --> 03:28:58.098]  Yeah, and all that.
[03:28:58.098 --> 03:28:59.139]  I mean, why not?
[03:28:59.139 --> 03:28:59.639]  Why not?
[03:28:59.639 --> 03:29:03.003]  I mean, the money machine is what's creating the problems.
[03:29:03.003 --> 03:29:04.625]  Look, these bankers are not going away.
[03:29:04.625 --> 03:29:09.430]  They've announced they're going to take the veterans' health care now, and it all goes to the bankers.
[03:29:09.430 --> 03:29:10.371]  Look, it's us or them.
[03:29:11.252 --> 03:29:18.254]  You know, just like my top search today, you know, it's the Bankers R Us, and we've just got to get it out there.
[03:29:18.254 --> 03:29:20.274]  Bankers R Us, top search term today.
[03:29:20.274 --> 03:29:23.855]  Here's the number to call if you want gold, silver, all of it, radio specials.
[03:29:23.855 --> 03:29:25.716]  Tell them I sent you to get the lowest price, 800-686-2237.
[03:29:25.716 --> 03:29:25.856]  800-686-2237.
[03:29:25.856 --> 03:29:30.317]  My video and audio breakdown of the Bankers R Us is coming up after the break.
[03:29:30.317 --> 03:29:30.357]  800-686-2237.
[03:29:38.759 --> 03:29:41.862]  Just wonderful job, Ted and Max Keiser and everybody.
[03:29:41.862 --> 03:29:43.323]  We believe in real money.
[03:29:43.323 --> 03:29:45.004]  We believe in gold and silver.
[03:29:45.004 --> 03:29:49.928]  And so we're promoting it and we've been proven right as they go up in price over the last 12 years.
[03:29:49.928 --> 03:29:51.589]  Stay with us.
[03:29:51.589 --> 03:29:52.990]  We're on the march.
[03:29:52.990 --> 03:29:54.652]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.652 --> 03:29:55.512]  Oh yeah!
[03:29:55.512 --> 03:29:58.334]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
