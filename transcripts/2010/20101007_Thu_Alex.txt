[00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:09.896]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.896 --> 00:00:11.478]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:13.060]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.225]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:21.289]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.915 --> 00:00:29.537]  Welcome my friends, welcome.
[00:00:29.537 --> 00:00:33.062]  It is Thursday, the seventh day of October 2010.
[00:00:33.062 --> 00:00:39.750]  Gold hit another all-time record today of thirteen hundred and sixty...
[00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:59.253]  Three dollars and change just amazing and that's happening here's the headline because dollar tumbles to a fresh 15-year low against the yen precious gold hits record set for best week in six months above $1,360 an ounce oil
[00:01:03.891 --> 00:01:04.712]  Heads back
[00:01:24.045 --> 00:01:24.465]  I don't know.
[00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:49.441]  In the last few weeks, they've announced in Europe, England, the United States, Canada, just thousands of public schools with retina scanners when the children arrive.
[00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:50.461]  Total police state.
[00:01:50.461 --> 00:01:55.082]  We're just going into the cashless society control grid designed by the banks.
[00:01:55.082 --> 00:01:59.703]  Bernanke finally tells the truth, says the United States is on the brink of financial disaster.
[00:01:59.703 --> 00:02:04.204]  But don't worry, the IMF says they've got a, quote, new world order.
[00:02:04.204 --> 00:02:09.105]  That's the mainstream news headline, a new world order.
[00:02:09.605 --> 00:02:15.929]  To fix that, where you give the banks that have engineered all this crisis even more power.
[00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:18.170]  They were given more power in October of 2008.
[00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.593]  They were given more power this year with the Federal Reserve being given control over the whole economy.
[00:02:22.593 --> 00:02:33.480]  Now they're going to transfer all of that offshore, and we will pay our taxes, our carbon taxes, our value-added taxes, and all these other money transfer taxes directly to the criminals.
[00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:38.252]  But the general public knows all about football and all about sitcoms.
[00:02:38.252 --> 00:02:42.855]  They don't know about international banking cartels, and so we're in a lot of trouble.
[00:02:42.855 --> 00:02:48.697]  Though some people are starting to wake up to this.
[00:02:48.697 --> 00:02:59.702]  The Republican candidate out in Nevada has pulled ahead of Harry Reid, and she talks about fluoride being deadly poison, vaccines being dangerous, and abolishing the Federal Reserve.
[00:02:59.702 --> 00:03:01.223]  They've tried to script her
[00:03:02.063 --> 00:03:04.866]  Uh, and cast her as a kook, but it isn't working.
[00:03:04.866 --> 00:03:10.671]  People go, wow, the mainstream media, MSNBC and CNN are calling her a lunatic kook.
[00:03:10.671 --> 00:03:12.452]  Wow, I better vote for her.
[00:03:12.452 --> 00:03:17.056]  Oh, the media is saying that Rand Paul kidnapped a woman.
[00:03:17.056 --> 00:03:21.961]  We better vote for, we better vote for him because they're liars and it comes out they were liars.
[00:03:24.332 --> 00:03:35.156]  Wow, Nightline's coming out doing giant hit pieces and MSNBC's doing hit pieces on Alex Jones at the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL every month now are saying I'm the most dangerous person out there.
[00:03:35.156 --> 00:03:48.460]  Wow, people are like, we better tune into this Alex Jones immediately if the establishment discredited media is saying he is the second incarnation of El Diablo.
[00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.341]  We've also got, again, the financial news.
[00:03:53.341 --> 00:03:55.302]  Incredible attacks on the First Amendment.
[00:03:55.302 --> 00:03:57.744]  I mean, it's manifesting even faster than I thought.
[00:03:57.744 --> 00:04:04.689]  I knew they were going to do this, but to see it actually happening, that is an entirely different thing.
[00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:08.931]  Supreme Court announced yesterday that, yeah, they're going to rule.
[00:04:08.931 --> 00:04:11.533]  They always hint at the end of arguments.
[00:04:11.533 --> 00:04:19.919]  And when the ruling comes out in the next few months, they always wait a few months to release the full write-up, that they're going to restrict protest because of these idiots.
[00:04:21.119 --> 00:04:33.424]  And I'm going to say that, and I've even interviewed them years ago, and I'm all for their First Amendment, but they are idiots going out to funerals of dead vets.
[00:04:33.424 --> 00:04:41.006]  Believe me, if my son had been killed and somebody was coming up screaming at the funeral, look, you're not going to have to worry about justice coming because I'd beat the living daylights out of you.
[00:04:41.006 --> 00:04:41.607]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[00:04:43.988 --> 00:04:49.838]  But, look, I don't want to... The point is, even though they're idiots, you've got to support their free speech.
[00:04:49.838 --> 00:04:56.569]  And now we're all going to lose it because the government is using these idiots as a poster child to kill freedom in this country.
[00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:57.931]  So we're going to be talking about that.
[00:04:57.931 --> 00:04:58.332]  Stay with us.

[00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:04.213]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:04.213 --> 00:07:05.134]  Number 1.
[00:07:05.134 --> 00:07:08.557]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:08.557 --> 00:07:09.417]  Number 2.
[00:07:09.417 --> 00:07:14.301]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:15.041]  It's true.
[00:07:15.041 --> 00:07:19.925]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:19.925 --> 00:07:20.746]  Number 3.
[00:07:20.746 --> 00:07:24.328]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:24.328 --> 00:07:28.031]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:28.231 --> 00:07:29.032]  Number 4.
[00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:31.794]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:31.794 --> 00:07:35.478]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:35.478 --> 00:07:36.259]  Number 5.
[00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:40.422]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:40.422 --> 00:07:45.167]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:45.467 --> 00:07:49.629]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:51.410]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:53.671]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:07:53.671 --> 00:07:56.173]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:07:56.173 --> 00:07:57.653]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:57.653 --> 00:08:01.716]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.223 --> 00:08:14.487]  It is Thursday, the seventh day of October 2010.
[00:08:14.487 --> 00:08:18.891]  We are going to have first-time calls in the first and second hour.
[00:08:18.891 --> 00:08:29.260]  Judge Andrew Napolitano, the only bonafide real patriot on Fox News, will be joining us in the last 30 minutes of the third hour today.
[00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.320]  That should be informative.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:35.785]  We do have Congressman Ron Paul joining us with key information.
[00:08:36.946 --> 00:08:55.135]  Coming up tomorrow when we kick off the broadcast also have a video Ron Paul put out We're gonna be playing later in the next hour where he talks about Staged you know crises martial law the collapse of society And he's been warning about this for a long time now.
[00:08:55.135 --> 00:08:58.377]  We are headed into that collapse obviously gold hit
[00:09:01.601 --> 00:09:04.142]  Thirteen hundred plus dollars.
[00:09:04.142 --> 00:09:07.122]  Thirteen hundred and sixty plus dollars today.
[00:09:07.122 --> 00:09:08.843]  There's been some profit taking.
[00:09:08.843 --> 00:09:10.583]  It's gone down about twenty dollars.
[00:09:10.583 --> 00:09:15.244]  We'll continue to watch that as it continues to unfold.
[00:09:15.244 --> 00:09:20.266]  Crude oil exploding, especially in Asia, at over eighty four dollars a barrel.
[00:09:21.466 --> 00:09:38.316]  I knew this was coming because this is the Chicago mafia, New York City, big city mafia model that was adopted in 1952 by the Pentagon with the annual comprehensive financial reports loan sharking model where
[00:09:39.471 --> 00:10:01.794]  Wall Street, the CIA, that's who set up the CIA, was Wall Street, comes in, pays off your city managers, gets them to invest most of your tax money off books, and then they basically then pay off the politicians with a small part of the profits, and then over time get the entire country and every local locality into debt
[00:10:02.888 --> 00:10:23.184]  And then they pass bigger packages of socialism to get people more dependent on government, so that even if you're mad and angry at the corrupt system, and you're living in poverty, you're still completely dependent on food, medicine, medical care, security, from the mafia itself.
[00:10:23.184 --> 00:10:25.626]  It's a sharecropping model.
[00:10:25.626 --> 00:10:29.810]  And it says McDonald's and 29 other firms get healthcare coverage waivers.
[00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:41.291]  Now, if you've got a small nursery, whether it's a nursery for children or a nursery for plants, and say you've got 15 employees, you're not going to get the waiver.
[00:10:41.291 --> 00:10:48.777]  Okay, they're paid $10 an hour, and if you're gonna give them insurance, that'll, you know, basically comes out to about, on average, about $18 an hour.
[00:10:48.777 --> 00:10:57.045]  You're just gonna have to lay off 30, 40% of your employees to give the other ones the healthcare, and they're gonna have their pay cut as well and have to pay for part of it.
[00:10:58.139 --> 00:11:04.983]  But tens of thousands of small companies, tens of thousands, they don't get exemptions.
[00:11:04.983 --> 00:11:09.386]  Infowars.com, as this healthcare comes in, isn't going to get exemptions.
[00:11:09.386 --> 00:11:16.349]  You know, I asked my employees years ago, and I asked them again this year, I said, do you want to get your full paycheck, or do you want me to get you healthcare?
[00:11:16.349 --> 00:11:18.070]  You're going to have to pay for half of it.
[00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:19.491]  That's standard.
[00:11:19.491 --> 00:11:20.192]  And they said no.
[00:11:20.192 --> 00:11:25.835]  A lot of them already have their own insurance, or they're young and don't want it, but that's their choice.
[00:11:28.613 --> 00:11:34.458]  Under this system, if it gets put into force in the next few years, I don't know what I'm going to do.
[00:11:34.458 --> 00:11:37.240]  I mean, I'm looking out here at the people that work in my office.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.701]  They're all essential.
[00:11:38.701 --> 00:11:44.706]  And I'm thinking about, hmm, I mean, I guess I'll just make them take health care and the big pay cut.
[00:11:46.644 --> 00:11:50.226]  And, of course, we'll still have to pay Social Security, and I've got to match that.
[00:11:50.226 --> 00:11:55.829]  So they also pull money out of your check for Medicare and Medicaid down the road for Social Security you're never getting.
[00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:59.510]  And then they've got the regular income taxes on top of it.
[00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:04.173]  And then they've passed three new city taxes and two new state taxes.
[00:12:04.173 --> 00:12:06.374]  And, I mean, it's killing us.
[00:12:06.374 --> 00:12:09.675]  It's just absolutely... People are like, well, just don't pay.
[00:12:09.675 --> 00:12:11.276]  Well, folks, we have to choose our battles.
[00:12:11.276 --> 00:12:14.258]  Do you know what will happen with the state comptroller if I don't pay all these taxes?
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:20.461]  About 10 years ago, I was late on just a couple hundred dollars sales tax.
[00:12:20.461 --> 00:12:23.642]  They'd done the calculation and they seized my entire bank account.
[00:12:23.642 --> 00:12:26.903]  Just seized the entire business account.
[00:12:26.903 --> 00:12:34.246]  And I mean, I'm living in tyranny and it's getting darker, the corruption is expanding, no one can deny it now.
[00:12:34.246 --> 00:12:41.388]  And so, it's just like when all these globalist firms that are based in Austin for green energy.
[00:12:42.268 --> 00:12:51.311]  And they are taxing Austinites in the next three years, 2.6 billion, Austin Energy announced, to pay for all these new power lines and solar plants and the rest of it.
[00:12:51.311 --> 00:12:54.411]  It's all sweetheart deals.
[00:12:54.411 --> 00:12:58.072]  For every job they create with this, it costs two jobs conservatively.
[00:12:58.072 --> 00:12:59.633]  The federal government admits that.
[00:12:59.633 --> 00:13:07.075]  I've got to pay for all this, and it all goes to select corporations and groups, and then they're all getting total tax exemption.
[00:13:07.075 --> 00:13:10.916]  All these companies that have moved to the town where I live, they don't have to pay
[00:13:12.316 --> 00:13:13.857]  Uh, property taxes.
[00:13:13.857 --> 00:13:15.777]  They don't have to pay all the other cities.
[00:13:15.777 --> 00:13:17.098]  They're just giving waivers.
[00:13:17.098 --> 00:13:19.498]  But not Alex Jones.
[00:13:19.498 --> 00:13:22.779]  And it's more than tens of thousands of small businesses.
[00:13:22.779 --> 00:13:24.680]  I mean, I've done the math.
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.701]  It's more than a million small businesses.
[00:13:27.701 --> 00:13:29.421]  In fact, guys, I saw that a few months ago.
[00:13:29.421 --> 00:13:32.462]  Search the term, number of small businesses in the U.S.
[00:13:32.462 --> 00:13:35.743]  I mean, I know it varies depending on how you break it down, but I know it's around a million.
[00:13:35.743 --> 00:13:39.264]  So, a million businesses.
[00:13:39.264 --> 00:13:41.005]  I misspoke when I said tens of thousands.
[00:13:42.338 --> 00:13:53.082]  Hundreds of thousands, conservatively, of businesses don't get any of these exemptions, but McDonald's and 29 other firms get health care coverage waivers.
[00:13:53.082 --> 00:13:55.143]  Look, you don't have to do it.
[00:13:55.143 --> 00:14:07.468]  And I said this was going to happen because I read the bill, but go back to last year with the automaker bailouts, which with the General Motors bailout, 30 plus billion went to them overall in the two different bailouts.
[00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:13.733]  It was a billion and a half to move a plant from Michigan to Brazil.
[00:14:13.733 --> 00:14:16.754]  Two billion dollars to move one to Eastern Europe.
[00:14:16.754 --> 00:14:19.095]  A couple billion to move a plant to China.
[00:14:19.095 --> 00:14:20.796]  I mean, you can search the term.
[00:14:20.796 --> 00:14:25.038]  Auto bailout money used to move plants outside U.S.
[00:14:26.147 --> 00:14:34.939]  So, my tax money, this is the New World Order, just naked, insane, absurdist, ridiculous corruption.
[00:14:34.939 --> 00:14:43.771]  I mean, what country in its right mind if it wasn't run by total swindling crooks that are basically engaged in a corporate breakup of the nation so they can consolidate it for pennies on the dollar?
[00:14:44.011 --> 00:14:47.835]  They want to wreck it so they can buy it up for pennies on the dollar.
[00:14:47.835 --> 00:14:58.607]  And they've got all the neocons up there now admitting the government wants to destroy things by design, but claiming because Obama is anti-colonialist and wants to destroy America.
[00:14:58.607 --> 00:15:02.432]  This process began way before Bill Clinton, even.
[00:15:02.432 --> 00:15:03.753]  This is globalism.
[00:15:03.753 --> 00:15:04.894]  This is NAFTA and GATT.
[00:15:05.535 --> 00:15:08.476]  This is what Republicans have supported as well.
[00:15:08.476 --> 00:15:10.837]  Don't ever forget that.
[00:15:10.837 --> 00:15:17.339]  And as distasteful as people like Van Jones and Cass Sunstein are, they are mid-level operatives.
[00:15:17.339 --> 00:15:19.339]  They are not at the top of the pyramid.
[00:15:19.339 --> 00:15:21.900]  They are not, in fact, give me a shot of the chessboard over here.
[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.581]  They are not the kings and the queens.
[00:15:24.581 --> 00:15:25.721]  They are not the rooks.
[00:15:25.721 --> 00:15:28.482]  They are not the knights.
[00:15:28.482 --> 00:15:31.223]  They are not the bishops, okay?
[00:15:31.223 --> 00:15:33.184]  They're not even pawns, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:34.264 --> 00:15:40.106]  I mean, Cass Sunstein might make up one one-hundredth of this pawn.
[00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:51.008]  All of Cass Sunstein's evil operations on a chessboard, in the enemy army, he might make up one one-hundredth of a pawn.
[00:15:51.008 --> 00:16:00.411]  Okay, now, you talk about the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Saxe-Coburg-Gothas, the Dutch royalty, they make up a king.
[00:16:01.883 --> 00:16:04.163]  All of them together make up a king on the chessboard.
[00:16:04.163 --> 00:16:06.044]  But I watch Glenn Beck.
[00:16:06.044 --> 00:16:10.925]  He sits up there and tells you that Van Jones is a knight.
[00:16:10.925 --> 00:16:14.106]  He tells you Cass Sunstein is a king.
[00:16:14.106 --> 00:16:16.006]  And he tells you they're communist.
[00:16:16.006 --> 00:16:17.406]  Well, they are communist.
[00:16:17.406 --> 00:16:20.287]  But not in the way the general public knows communism.
[00:16:20.287 --> 00:16:25.088]  Communism isn't a bunch of dirty hippies, you know, running around with machine guns.
[00:16:25.088 --> 00:16:27.608]  It's always financed by big mega banks.
[00:16:27.608 --> 00:16:28.008]  In 1917 in Russia.
[00:16:28.008 --> 00:16:28.388]  In 1949 in China.
[00:16:31.556 --> 00:16:44.919]  As Carol Quigley, the historian for the CFR and CIA, Bill Clinton's mentor wrote, anything that consolidates power, anything that creates tyranny, and a vertical integration, the globalists support it.
[00:16:46.607 --> 00:16:52.430]  Okay, now I do have to say, on the Beck issue, we were monitoring last night, and I left here, and Aaron said he was going to have it.
[00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:56.873]  I don't know if he put it on the iOmega computer, but you guys might want to check this.
[00:16:56.873 --> 00:17:04.097]  It's a clip of Glenn Beck last night saying that the Fabian socialists wanted to poison the water to sterilize you.
[00:17:04.097 --> 00:17:05.377]  And I've been begging him to do that.
[00:17:06.919 --> 00:17:14.234]  Look, I don't trust him, don't like him, but I said when he gets better and tells the truth, we will support what he says that is true.
[00:17:14.234 --> 00:17:17.721]  We will point out what he says that is a distortion or a limited hangout.
[00:17:18.522 --> 00:17:21.384]  Or blaming it on patsies or low-level minions.
[00:17:21.384 --> 00:17:23.485]  But that's a big step, okay?
[00:17:23.485 --> 00:17:26.807]  That Glenn Beck is now, because these are the quotes, these are the plans.
[00:17:26.807 --> 00:17:28.348]  Remember Nightline?
[00:17:28.348 --> 00:17:32.191]  Was like, Alex Jones is some type of dangerous lunatic.
[00:17:32.191 --> 00:17:38.575]  And groups that monitor extremists are extremely concerned about him because he's the biggest and the baddest and the most dangerous.
[00:17:38.575 --> 00:17:44.559]  And, you know, if you stand on a street corner and say the government's putting stuff in the water to sterilize you, you'd be laughed at.
[00:17:44.559 --> 00:17:47.541]  But when you do it on the radio, you get a million listeners every day.
[00:17:48.649 --> 00:17:58.456]  Well, all I'm doing is reading Ecoscience by the White House Science Czar, himself a pawn.
[00:17:58.456 --> 00:18:01.038]  All I'm doing is reading what Bertrand Russell said.
[00:18:01.038 --> 00:18:03.279]  All I'm doing is reading what Shaw said.
[00:18:03.279 --> 00:18:05.521]  All I'm doing is reading what the UN said.
[00:18:05.521 --> 00:18:14.427]  I mean, literally, literally, hundreds of mainstream news articles in the last six months calling for adding things to the water to reduce fertility.
[00:18:15.618 --> 00:18:20.223]  Hundreds of articles calling for forced inoculations to reduce fertility.
[00:18:20.223 --> 00:18:23.706]  Hundreds of articles calling for taxes on people that have children.
[00:18:23.706 --> 00:18:26.529]  Hundreds of articles calling for a global tyranny.
[00:18:26.529 --> 00:18:31.113]  They call it eco-fascism and they call it that themselves.
[00:18:31.113 --> 00:18:33.796]  London Guardian, you name it, and say it's good, we need it.
[00:18:35.031 --> 00:18:37.372]  So all, I'm not the lunatic.
[00:18:37.372 --> 00:18:42.334]  I know this stuff is crazy sounding, but I'm the one reporting on what they're saying.
[00:18:42.334 --> 00:18:43.915]  They are the lunatics.
[00:18:43.915 --> 00:18:45.395]  They are the dangerous people.
[00:18:45.395 --> 00:19:00.082]  You know, when I read an Operation Northwoods, which the Pentagon green-lighted to stage bombings, shootings, and hijackings and crashing of jets by remote control to blame it on foreign enemies, yeah, it sounds crazy to be reading that on air, but it's ABC News!
[00:19:00.862 --> 00:19:02.104]  It's Baltimore Sun.
[00:19:02.104 --> 00:19:03.846]  It's the declassified document.
[00:19:03.846 --> 00:19:05.828]  What am I just supposed to... Oh, you know what?
[00:19:05.828 --> 00:19:06.869]  We're not going to cover this.
[00:19:06.869 --> 00:19:10.934]  But getting back to the main issue that I was starting to get into here.
[00:19:10.934 --> 00:19:18.042]  Just like with the bailouts of the cars, the money was given to transfer the industry overseas.
[00:19:19.074 --> 00:19:32.689]  And it came out in Congress that anybody who'd given big money to Democrats who own dealerships, some of them that have been around for over 80 years and were worth tens of millions of dollars a year, they were allowed to keep their franchise.
[00:19:34.022 --> 00:19:45.467]  But those that didn't, the Obama people, district by district, literally with the Congress people acting like mafia pimps, would take the dealership away and give it to one of their other operatives.
[00:19:45.467 --> 00:19:49.509]  I mean, that's hardcore mafia racketeering out in the open.
[00:19:49.509 --> 00:19:52.590]  Well, here it is on health care.
[00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:55.731]  McDonald's and 29 other firms are exempt.
[00:19:55.731 --> 00:19:58.693]  They don't have to pay for anything for health care.
[00:19:58.693 --> 00:19:59.113]  But you do.
[00:20:01.144 --> 00:20:05.466]  If your handgun is loaded and easy to get to, it's also dangerous.
[00:20:05.466 --> 00:20:10.948]  What if you could reach your loaded handgun instantly and still provide a margin of safety for your family?
[00:20:10.948 --> 00:20:14.590]  Introducing the DragonDraw Gun Vault from MyQuickSafe.com.
[00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:20.692]  The DragonDraw Gun Vault is a small, portable gun safe for sub-compact pistols or snub-nose revolvers.
[00:20:20.692 --> 00:20:25.634]  It's made of heavy-gauge steel, padded inside, and uses your fingerprint to open and close.
[00:20:25.634 --> 00:20:27.395]  With the DragonDraw Gun Vault, you'll now be
[00:20:27.415 --> 00:20:27.615]  I think so.
[00:20:51.289 --> 00:20:53.411]  Or go to myquicksave.com.
[00:20:53.411 --> 00:20:59.716]  Stay locked, loaded, and safe with the Drag and Draw Gun Vault from myquicksave.com.
[00:20:59.716 --> 00:21:02.098]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:21:02.098 --> 00:21:04.420]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.642]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:21:07.642 --> 00:21:12.746]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:21:12.746 --> 00:21:16.950]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:19.691]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:21:19.691 --> 00:21:22.132]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:21:22.132 --> 00:21:25.394]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:21:25.394 --> 00:21:32.997]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:21:33.331 --> 00:21:38.713]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:21:38.713 --> 00:21:41.034]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:21:41.034 --> 00:21:45.256]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:21:45.256 --> 00:21:46.316]  And I got news for you.
[00:21:46.316 --> 00:21:47.657]  You're everyone else.
[00:21:47.657 --> 00:21:49.157]  Invisible Empire.

[00:22:25.069 --> 00:22:32.318]  As the inflation pinch becomes tighter and the dollar continues to devalue, while stocks remain iffy at best, stop the bleeding with precious metals.
[00:22:32.318 --> 00:22:37.084]  Metals will let you retain your purchasing power, protect your assets, and stop inflation the day you get in.
[00:22:37.084 --> 00:22:42.991]  I have many different ways to accomplish this, from metals for possession to IRA rollovers, tax-free, and everything in between.
[00:22:43.231 --> 00:22:48.158]  So if you would like to turn your scrambled nest egg into a souffle, call me, Duane Daly, at 800-686-2237, extension 115.

[00:22:48.759 --> 00:22:50.782]  If you are ready for a change, please call Duane Daly.
[00:22:58.752 --> 00:23:01.754]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[00:23:01.754 --> 00:23:03.835]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[00:23:03.835 --> 00:23:06.577]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[00:23:06.577 --> 00:23:08.798]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[00:23:08.798 --> 00:23:10.219]  Okay, here it comes.
[00:23:10.219 --> 00:23:12.121]  But first, the facts.
[00:23:12.121 --> 00:23:14.042]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[00:23:14.042 --> 00:23:16.043]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[00:23:16.043 --> 00:23:19.726]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[00:23:19.726 --> 00:23:27.470]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:28.071]  Sinofresh.

[00:23:47.696 --> 00:23:48.116]  Mention GCN.

[00:23:48.996 --> 00:23:49.356]  It works!
[00:24:25.638 --> 00:24:39.149]  People of the world!
[00:24:39.149 --> 00:24:41.792]  Make no mistake, people are waking up fast.
[00:24:41.792 --> 00:24:50.379]  Faster than they ever had in modern history, and even one of the top globalist thinkers and planners, Zbigniew Brzezinski, of course, admitted that four months ago.
[00:24:52.318 --> 00:24:56.220]  But the public is waking up, but not really to the full horror.
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:25:06.586]  I mean, it's taken me 17 years of deep research, 15 years on air, to really get a basic grasp of the full spectrum that we're facing.
[00:25:06.586 --> 00:25:14.270]  And let me tell you, it is indescribably hardcore, indescribably real and serious and bonafide.
[00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:14.610]  We are
[00:25:15.971 --> 00:25:24.998]  Living in a system run by ruthless, mass-murdering, control-freak killers who are committing crime everywhere.
[00:25:24.998 --> 00:25:30.602]  Naked body scanners, mobile scanners frying your house and the operators.
[00:25:30.602 --> 00:25:34.365]  DU with the troops.
[00:25:34.365 --> 00:25:36.567]  Trillions stolen by the banks.
[00:25:36.567 --> 00:25:37.788]  False flag terror.
[00:25:39.059 --> 00:25:40.480]  The Obama administration.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:48.424]  I mean, that's bold to take hundreds of dealerships from Republican donors as part of a political war.
[00:25:48.424 --> 00:25:50.905]  I mean, that is so criminal.
[00:25:50.905 --> 00:25:57.029]  And it's so criminal with selective enforcement to give 30 waivers.
[00:25:57.029 --> 00:26:00.951]  McDonald's and 29 other firms get health care coverage waivers.
[00:26:00.951 --> 00:26:06.274]  And they pulled up the numbers from the National Association of Small Businesses.
[00:26:06.274 --> 00:26:08.235]  It was, what was it?
[00:26:10.455 --> 00:26:14.276]  How many, 29.6 million small businesses.
[00:26:14.276 --> 00:26:15.436]  So I was way off the mark.
[00:26:15.436 --> 00:26:19.157]  I knew it was in the millions.
[00:26:19.157 --> 00:26:22.378]  29 plus million small businesses.
[00:26:22.378 --> 00:26:38.002]  You don't get this healthcare tax exemption, but the big mega corporations like McDonald's and Jack in the Box and 28 other major companies, they get
[00:26:40.629 --> 00:26:41.189]  The waiver.
[00:26:41.189 --> 00:26:44.391]  They don't have to get insurance for their employees.
[00:26:44.391 --> 00:26:46.352]  Because it would shut down the fast food industry.
[00:26:46.352 --> 00:26:49.374]  What the average pay is about $10 an hour.
[00:26:49.374 --> 00:26:52.195]  Can you imagine if they had to give them health care coverage?
[00:26:52.195 --> 00:26:57.798]  On average it would probably add $5-$6 to their pay.
[00:26:57.798 --> 00:26:58.879]  And what are those companies going to do?
[00:26:58.879 --> 00:27:02.761]  They're going to take it out of the pay, at least part of it, of their employees.
[00:27:02.761 --> 00:27:05.943]  And so how are the employees going to live on $6 an hour?
[00:27:05.943 --> 00:27:07.163]  How are you going to do that?
[00:27:07.163 --> 00:27:08.564]  How are you going to?
[00:27:08.564 --> 00:27:09.605]  It's hard to live on $10 an hour.
[00:27:11.616 --> 00:27:12.718]  How are you going to do that?
[00:27:12.718 --> 00:27:14.721]  Well, you're not.
[00:27:14.721 --> 00:27:16.463]  The economy is going to implode.
[00:27:16.463 --> 00:27:18.125]  Meanwhile, we've got 40 million illegals.
[00:27:18.125 --> 00:27:20.048]  It's well over 30 million.
[00:27:20.048 --> 00:27:21.711]  35, 40 million illegal aliens.
[00:27:21.711 --> 00:27:23.233]  The government admits 20 million.
[00:27:23.233 --> 00:27:24.395]  All getting free healthcare.
[00:27:26.249 --> 00:27:49.742]  All of the major border states are in a state of bankruptcy, or going into bankruptcy, and there's more unfunded mandates, and more corruption, and meanwhile they're about to get rid of their conservative and name only Arnold Schwarzenegger in California, and probably going to elect Mr. Brown, who's about as socialist as it gets.
[00:27:49.742 --> 00:27:51.783]  Oh, I mean, what's going to happen to California?
[00:27:51.783 --> 00:27:53.704]  It's a beautiful state, a lot of great people.
[00:27:57.651 --> 00:27:59.173]  What's going to happen to California?
[00:27:59.173 --> 00:28:02.738]  Where is all of this going to end?
[00:28:02.738 --> 00:28:05.401]  So I want to get more into the economy later.
[00:28:05.401 --> 00:28:11.089]  I've got a clip of Ron Paul where he talks about when the economy collapses, false flag, etc.
[00:28:12.555 --> 00:28:15.076]  A very, very powerful video clip from Ron Paul.
[00:28:15.076 --> 00:28:16.097]  He's getting more and more bold.
[00:28:16.097 --> 00:28:22.419]  A few months ago he came out and said there's been a coup in this country, the CIA runs the nation, and they're shipping in the drugs.
[00:28:22.419 --> 00:28:24.360]  And he was given thunderous applause.
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:31.563]  Just like he was given thunderous applause and won the major Republican straw poll.
[00:28:33.394 --> 00:28:34.034]  I mean, wow!
[00:28:55.288 --> 00:28:56.529]  People get confused.
[00:28:56.529 --> 00:28:59.552]  They say, well, are you bashing Beck or are you praising him?
[00:28:59.552 --> 00:29:07.898]  I'm bashing him when he gives you disinformation or twisted info, and I'm saying this is true, this is good, when he does the right thing.
[00:29:07.898 --> 00:29:09.980]  And he's going in a better direction.
[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:11.261]  I'm not endorsing Glenn Beck.
[00:29:11.261 --> 00:29:11.962]  I don't trust him.
[00:29:11.962 --> 00:29:13.123]  I want to be clear about that.
[00:29:13.123 --> 00:29:15.445]  People are like, well, why are you talking about Glenn Beck?
[00:29:15.445 --> 00:29:19.048]  Well, because he's co-opted much of the true patriot movement.
[00:29:19.912 --> 00:29:26.833]  And I don't trust Fox News and he's being set up as the leader by the controlled corporate media to let her be destroyed.
[00:29:26.833 --> 00:29:28.954]  And so he's a very important figure and we're talking about it.
[00:29:28.954 --> 00:29:31.554]  Alright, but side issue.
[00:29:31.554 --> 00:29:39.175]  When I get back, we're going to get into the massive attack on the First Amendment that is out in the open now.
[00:29:39.175 --> 00:29:47.697]  We're going to get into the latest developments with the shooting of this man with his wife out on the jet ski on a lake bordering Mexico and South Texas.
[00:29:47.697 --> 00:29:48.637]  That's coming up as well.
[00:29:48.637 --> 00:29:49.057]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.814 --> 00:29:54.756]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.756 --> 00:30:00.379]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.379 --> 00:30:03.521]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[00:30:03.521 --> 00:30:07.303]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[00:30:07.303 --> 00:30:10.184]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[00:30:10.184 --> 00:30:15.127]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.

[00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:40.192]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it, with open talk of a strike on Iran in the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.
[00:30:40.192 --> 00:30:41.992]  Get yourself and your family ready today.

[00:31:04.449 --> 00:31:05.711]  Tyranny is here.
[00:31:05.711 --> 00:31:09.654]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:31:09.654 --> 00:31:11.877]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:31:11.877 --> 00:31:17.763]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:31:17.763 --> 00:31:24.009]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:31:24.409 --> 00:31:30.394]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:31:30.394 --> 00:31:34.578]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:31:34.578 --> 00:31:38.862]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:31:38.862 --> 00:31:44.807]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:31:44.807 --> 00:31:48.370]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:50.351]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:31:50.351 --> 00:31:50.792]  It's here.
[00:31:51.432 --> 00:32:01.038]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:32:01.038 --> 00:32:16.508]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:32:16.508 --> 00:32:20.191]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:21.195 --> 00:32:33.967]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:32:33.967 --> 00:32:41.233]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:32:41.914 --> 00:32:52.298]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:32:52.298 --> 00:32:56.220]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:32:56.220 --> 00:33:06.343]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:33:06.343 --> 00:33:07.684]  We now take you live
[00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:21.303]  Okay, before I get back into all of this incredibly important news, the good, the bad and the ugly,
[00:33:27.987 --> 00:33:37.330]  I do want to just put out the toll-free number to join us for first-time callers throughout the end of this hour and the full second hour.
[00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:43.931]  Then we'll have open phones as we go into the third hour and Judge Andrew Napolitano joining us here on the transmission.
[00:33:43.931 --> 00:33:45.432]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:45.432 --> 00:33:48.653]  And at least once a week I like to open the phones up for first-time callers.
[00:33:48.653 --> 00:33:49.133]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:49.133 --> 00:33:50.313]  Any of the issues we've raised here,
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:00.081]  You're free to call in about or any other issue.
[00:34:00.081 --> 00:34:05.044]  It's wide open phones for first-time callers 1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:05.044 --> 00:34:13.289]  They have a ballroom, the Coconut Grove Ballroom, in beautiful Santa Cruz right there on the ocean.
[00:34:13.289 --> 00:34:15.110]  And it holds 800 people.
[00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:16.491]  And the tickets are $10.80.
[00:34:16.491 --> 00:34:19.953]  That's the frequency of K-S-C-O-A-M.
[00:34:20.914 --> 00:34:21.194]  I don't know.
[00:34:43.715 --> 00:34:51.662]  And so MZ has the facilities at KSCO AM there in Santa Cruz blasting into San Francisco.
[00:34:51.662 --> 00:34:54.084]  We're also on another station he owns in the area.
[00:34:58.541 --> 00:35:03.585]  We're going to be having an event on Monday now at the Coconut Grove as well.
[00:35:03.585 --> 00:35:13.872]  So it'll be Sunday 6 o'clock, Monday 7 o'clock, then I fly out the next morning and I'll be able to do my radio broadcast live from the KSCO AM 1080 studios.
[00:35:13.872 --> 00:35:16.594]  So I'll be live on that Monday the 25th.
[00:35:18.595 --> 00:35:18.955]  I don't know.
[00:35:36.684 --> 00:35:40.908]  I've only plugged this three times and it's sold out.
[00:35:40.908 --> 00:35:46.914]  And I've pointed out, you know, we've had events with 1,200, 1,400 people where we turned away 600 people.
[00:35:46.914 --> 00:35:49.637]  And so if you want to get those tickets, get them quickly.
[00:35:51.332 --> 00:36:05.907]  Continuing here, we are carrying the new video, What in the World Are They Spraying?, an excellent film on chemtrails, the first film to come out since they've admitted that chemtrails are part of an aerosol spraying campaign to, quote, protect us from global warming.
[00:36:05.907 --> 00:36:07.168]  That's obviously a cover story.
[00:36:07.168 --> 00:36:08.249]  It's very toxic.
[00:36:08.249 --> 00:36:09.530]  This film is very important.
[00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:14.996]  It ships October 22nd, and if you want to get it first, order it at InfoWars.com today.
[00:36:15.356 --> 00:36:15.656]  I don't know.
[00:36:34.154 --> 00:36:42.736]  Where you get a Obama deception film for $19.95 and get a free copy of Jesse Ventura's excellent book, American Conspiracies.
[00:36:42.736 --> 00:36:49.697]  We're also, over the weekend, going to end the special for four copies of Endgame for the price of one.
[00:36:49.697 --> 00:36:56.218]  $19.95, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, what I think is my most important and overall film that covers their entire agenda.
[00:36:56.218 --> 00:36:58.679]  You can give this film to anybody and they'll watch the three hours.
[00:36:59.299 --> 00:37:02.960]  They will certainly have a first-rate understanding, and it's all documented.
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:16.303]  There's an online website, whatistheendgame.com, that has a full online bibliography of every document, every video clip, every news item we show you is all linked or posted there at whatistheendgame.com.
[00:37:16.303 --> 00:37:18.904]  So you can say, here's the video, everything in it.
[00:37:18.904 --> 00:37:23.285]  You can, you know, stop it and pause it and Google whatever Alex is talking about or whatever he's showing.
[00:37:24.505 --> 00:37:32.109]  But you can also go to whatistheendgame.com and it's got a, in fact, most of the films now have these online bibliographies.
[00:37:32.109 --> 00:37:34.971]  We don't have the time, energy, or staff to do it.
[00:37:34.971 --> 00:37:40.073]  It's been volunteers have just done it and every time it's an excellent breakdown.
[00:37:40.073 --> 00:37:46.176]  They go look at my film, they check all the research, they find the links, they send us the links, and we build the site.
[00:37:46.176 --> 00:37:52.440]  The first film we did that with was 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State.
[00:37:53.479 --> 00:37:53.579]  to
[00:38:10.336 --> 00:38:17.059]  Here's a movie that shows how they're putting poison in your drinking water and doing secret experiments on you and why they're doing it.
[00:38:17.059 --> 00:38:18.719]  People laugh at you.
[00:38:18.719 --> 00:38:27.323]  But now, because the socialists and the globalists and the environmentalists are openly promoting it, people are now listening.
[00:38:27.323 --> 00:38:29.744]  And now because Beck's covering it, people are listening.
[00:38:29.744 --> 00:38:37.947]  Well, it's time to help folks graduate from baby rice cereal, known as PAP, to giant
[00:38:39.724 --> 00:38:43.886]  45 ounce T-bone steak.
[00:38:43.886 --> 00:38:44.647]  Okay?
[00:38:44.647 --> 00:38:46.348]  This is not for babies.
[00:38:46.348 --> 00:38:48.409]  Endgame.
[00:38:48.409 --> 00:38:49.769]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:38:49.769 --> 00:38:50.930]  What's it say on the back?
[00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:53.931]  They want you dead.
[00:38:53.931 --> 00:38:55.132]  They want you dead.
[00:38:55.132 --> 00:38:55.892]  Okay?
[00:38:55.892 --> 00:38:57.313]  Not my words, theirs.
[00:38:57.313 --> 00:38:58.434]  This isn't a game.
[00:38:58.434 --> 00:39:00.435]  You have children?
[00:39:00.435 --> 00:39:01.135]  You care about them?
[00:39:01.135 --> 00:39:02.736]  You need to find out about this, okay?
[00:39:02.736 --> 00:39:04.997]  This isn't a joke.
[00:39:04.997 --> 00:39:06.498]  This isn't a game we're playing up here.
[00:39:06.498 --> 00:39:07.118]  This is real.
[00:39:08.595 --> 00:39:29.572]  Do you think I could be on all these AM and FM stations, and global shortwave, satellite, you name it, and be saying Bayer Pharmaceuticals knowingly shipped out over a million ampoules of Factor VIII knowing it had HIV and hepatitis in it, and it came out in court documents in France where they got convicted that they knowingly did it.
[00:39:29.572 --> 00:39:32.794]  It wasn't it was a mistake, or they didn't care, or they just wanted profits.
[00:39:32.794 --> 00:39:33.415]  They did it!
[00:39:33.855 --> 00:39:37.437]  They knew and they did it because they wanted to reduce population.
[00:39:37.437 --> 00:39:40.519]  You think I'd get away with that for 10 minutes if it wasn't true?
[00:39:40.519 --> 00:39:47.164]  Now I've got MSNBC and Reuters admitting it as well, but the point is it sounds crazy.
[00:39:47.164 --> 00:39:55.829]  But if you won't go check it out and find out I'm telling you the truth, you can just search the term MSNBC Bayer blood scandal and you'll get clips.
[00:39:56.826 --> 00:40:00.149]  Or you'll get news articles, but a lot of you won't go check it out.
[00:40:00.149 --> 00:40:01.411]  You just say, that guy's nuts.
[00:40:01.411 --> 00:40:02.792]  There's no way that's true.
[00:40:02.792 --> 00:40:08.257]  There's no way DU, the government knows it's going to kill the troops and give them cancer and birth defects in their children.
[00:40:08.257 --> 00:40:11.541]  When we have their own reports, the former head of the DU program on.
[00:40:11.541 --> 00:40:14.564]  Well, instead of just saying, I'm crazy, go look it up.
[00:40:14.564 --> 00:40:18.107]  Or even if you're lazy and won't do that, understand this.
[00:40:18.107 --> 00:40:20.289]  I would be sued into oblivion.
[00:40:21.098 --> 00:40:28.342]  If I got up here and said that about Bayer Pharmaceuticals and it wasn't true, I would be sued and I've been saying it for many years before it was mainstream news.
[00:40:28.342 --> 00:40:31.003]  We had medical doctors and scientists on about it.
[00:40:31.003 --> 00:40:33.104]  One medical doctor up in Arkansas had exposed it.
[00:40:33.104 --> 00:40:37.887]  Clinton was involved in it and they firebombed his clinic.
[00:40:37.887 --> 00:40:41.348]  I mean, and I called him back to get him on and he just said, look, I'm done talking.
[00:40:41.348 --> 00:40:42.109]  I've been firebombed.
[00:40:42.915 --> 00:40:52.463]  And the same night they firebombed the Hemophiliac Society of Canada because they were involved in the lawsuits 10 years ago to expose this.
[00:40:52.463 --> 00:40:59.789]  They were exposing this, well, going back 15 years and then 10 years ago, and it was only the last four years that finally it broke into mainstream media.
[00:40:59.789 --> 00:41:03.852]  But the firebombing didn't cover it up, the intimidation didn't cover it up.
[00:41:03.852 --> 00:41:10.017]  You know, I get death-threatened when I talk about Dyncor running child kidnapping rings.
[00:41:10.017 --> 00:41:11.979]  I mean, it's in the Chicago Tribune, I'm gonna cover it.
[00:41:12.952 --> 00:41:15.415]  And I'm not going to shut up when I get death-threatened, okay?
[00:41:15.415 --> 00:41:16.417]  I'm committed.
[00:41:16.417 --> 00:41:17.818]  I'm not backing off.
[00:41:17.818 --> 00:41:21.103]  But the issue here is, this is real.
[00:41:21.103 --> 00:41:28.312]  They shot up children and men and women in Guatemala, a US government program, telling them they were getting vaccines with syphilis.
[00:41:29.395 --> 00:41:31.976]  I told you that was a worldwide program with the syphilis.
[00:41:31.976 --> 00:41:46.321]  They put SV40, high-powered cancer virus, that the government admits gave hundreds of millions of Americans since the 50s, cancers that were unknown or rare are now widespread and SV40 is communicable.
[00:41:47.617 --> 00:41:51.600]  Almost the entire population of the world now has SV40 in them.
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:55.123]  It's a bioengineered cancer virus.
[00:41:55.123 --> 00:41:59.406]  In 1910 through the 1930s, we've got the Rockefeller Foundation documents.
[00:41:59.406 --> 00:42:05.650]  We've linked them in the films, on the websites, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, where they discovered this.
[00:42:05.650 --> 00:42:07.712]  They bought up the hospitals.
[00:42:07.712 --> 00:42:10.134]  They control the patents on most cancer treatment.
[00:42:10.794 --> 00:42:15.420]  That's why they won't let real alternative mainline medical treatments be used.
[00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:17.142]  Because they won't let you.
[00:42:17.142 --> 00:42:19.205]  They make the money.
[00:42:19.205 --> 00:42:26.654]  They soft kill you and then suck all the money out of you as you die.
[00:42:26.654 --> 00:42:28.357]  Remember that
[00:42:31.445 --> 00:42:39.160]  The head of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, in the 50s testified before Congress in the early 50s and said La Cosa Nostra didn't exist.
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:40.423]  Now you know that's ridiculous.
[00:42:40.423 --> 00:42:41.305]  The mafia exists.
[00:42:43.618 --> 00:42:49.320]  And the media's telling you for decades there's no world government, big banks don't run it, there's no plan for a carbon tax.
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:50.920]  Now you know they were stalling you.
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:52.181]  They were lying to you.
[00:42:52.181 --> 00:43:02.144]  And now we're at the point of the global collapse, by design, with socialist, government-run healthcare, with death panels, now admitted in the bill, now law, Bill Gates telling you how great it is.
[00:43:02.144 --> 00:43:06.765]  See, to get it passed, they lied and said it wasn't there, but we could read the section and there it was!
[00:43:06.765 --> 00:43:08.626]  They'd say, shut up, liars!
[00:43:08.626 --> 00:43:13.107]  And now that they've got it passed, they've got to implement it, and they go, actually there are death panels, but it's good for you.
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:16.726]  And they play the population off against themselves.
[00:43:16.726 --> 00:43:21.878]  Oh, um, you know, we can hire 10 teachers if we don't give grandma treatment for cancer.
[00:43:23.476 --> 00:43:34.279]  To try to get 10 teachers, to get the teachers out there listening, the millions of teachers, to think, wow, I'll get a job, I'll get a raise if I sign on to Blood Thirsty Eugenics.
[00:43:34.279 --> 00:43:45.282]  It's you, teachers, in 20 years or 10 years when you need medical care, or next month when you get diagnosed with breast cancer at 45, you're the one that's going to have the death panel say no.
[00:43:45.282 --> 00:43:46.742]  Do you understand that?
[00:43:47.955 --> 00:43:54.659]  Even if you're a bloodthirsty parasite who believes that the globalists are gonna kill granny and give you some money.
[00:43:54.659 --> 00:43:56.300]  Are you that stupid?
[00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.562]  They don't want to just kill granny, lady.
[00:43:58.562 --> 00:44:00.783]  They want to kill you!
[00:44:00.783 --> 00:44:02.044]  You got it?
[00:44:02.044 --> 00:44:03.065]  I hope you got it!
[00:44:03.065 --> 00:44:06.367]  I hope you got it real good!
[00:44:06.367 --> 00:44:15.753]  You think I just get up here and say every major vaccine that's been tested over and over again has been found with designer RNA cancer viruses that plug into your DNA?
[00:44:18.601 --> 00:44:27.346]  You think cancer is up over 3,000% on average in the Western world because the Easter Bunny is going around at night climbing up on your bed and shooting you up with it?
[00:44:27.346 --> 00:44:27.526]  No!
[00:44:29.212 --> 00:44:38.077]  You think I can get up here for 10 minutes and tell you don't take the H1N1 shot because it'll cause major brain damage without having top scientists on and show what the trials did?
[00:44:38.077 --> 00:44:44.640]  You think I can get up here and tell you it destroys your immunity and more than doubles your chances of getting the regular flu and dying from it?
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:46.441]  That's four different studies.
[00:44:46.441 --> 00:44:50.263]  Canada, the US, Germany, China.
[00:44:50.263 --> 00:44:51.063]  There's more than that.
[00:44:51.063 --> 00:44:54.185]  That was just the one headline I saw last year with all the medical studies.
[00:44:54.185 --> 00:44:55.085]  In fact, people won't believe it.
[00:44:55.085 --> 00:44:57.707]  Search the term right now.
[00:44:57.707 --> 00:44:58.167]  This is key.
[00:44:59.987 --> 00:45:07.489]  H1N1 vaccine doubles chances to get regular flu.
[00:45:07.489 --> 00:45:09.630]  Or more than doubles.
[00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:15.472]  And you'll get CBC, was the first clip that came up a week ago when I was researching it for a film I'm doing.
[00:45:15.472 --> 00:45:19.713]  Because even though I'd already done the research, you gotta go from memory and make sure you're right and pull it up.
[00:45:19.713 --> 00:45:26.455]  It's just always double-checking, triple-checking all the research we've done, all the thousands and thousands of data points and information.
[00:45:29.309 --> 00:45:34.293]  That we've been covering here on this broadcast.
[00:45:34.293 --> 00:45:47.763]  But yes, you have a government so evil that by the early 1950s, and I've got a video by one of the vaccine developers in Canada on Kennedy and TV laughing about how they knew it had the cancer virus in it.
[00:45:47.763 --> 00:45:49.204]  We've played that before.
[00:45:49.204 --> 00:45:50.545]  I'd like to see Glenn Beck play that.
[00:45:50.545 --> 00:45:51.466]  Maybe he will next week.
[00:45:52.515 --> 00:46:12.474]  I know the exact video clips we played four years ago on the show, last year on the show, this year in the show, that we source in Endgame, that in the Eugenics film I've been working on for more than two years, it's the very clips that Glenn Beck played last night are in the Eugenics film that's more than half finished.
[00:46:14.431 --> 00:46:21.694]  Two years of intense work on this and it's so powerful that I just can't release it yet.
[00:46:21.694 --> 00:46:25.716]  There's so much new stuff coming out.
[00:46:25.716 --> 00:46:26.116]  There it is.
[00:46:26.116 --> 00:46:27.677]  Seasonal flu shot may increase H1N1 risk.
[00:46:30.273 --> 00:46:37.158]  Yeah, that's CBC, but that's another study about how the regular seasonal flu shot increases.
[00:46:37.158 --> 00:46:45.224]  There'll be another one with other studies about the H1N1 doubling the contraction of the seasonal.
[00:46:45.224 --> 00:46:46.625]  So it's vice versa.
[00:46:46.625 --> 00:46:49.968]  Because the truth is, vaccines lower your immunity.
[00:46:49.968 --> 00:46:55.932]  They are not a full-bore virus, and so your body learns to see it as not so much of a threat.
[00:46:55.932 --> 00:46:57.093]  That's what the studies show.
[00:46:57.093 --> 00:46:58.715]  And so when you get hit with a real virus,
[00:46:59.932 --> 00:47:03.379]  A wild virus or a man-made virus?
[00:47:03.379 --> 00:47:08.809]  Now you're gonna get real sick.
[00:47:08.809 --> 00:47:10.332]  You're gonna get real sick.
[00:47:12.415 --> 00:47:19.957]  And that's why our immunity, I mean, it's like all these big studies about hand sanitizers linked to cancer and reduced immunity.
[00:47:19.957 --> 00:47:31.960]  Absolutely, people that have worked in barnyards, people that have worked in gardens, people that have, they've done studies of trash truck people, you know, trash men.
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:32.740]  You can pull those up.
[00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:36.661]  They have some of the highest immunities and some of the lowest levels of disease.
[00:47:36.661 --> 00:47:36.921]  Why?
[00:47:36.921 --> 00:47:39.582]  Because they're knee-deep in garbage, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:40.422 --> 00:47:44.504]  They're neat, and the body goes, man, I am in a filthy environment.
[00:47:44.504 --> 00:47:46.526]  I better buck up.
[00:47:46.526 --> 00:47:47.886]  I better gear up.
[00:47:47.886 --> 00:47:52.309]  But you're Bubble Boy, getting hundreds of vaccines by the time you're 10 years old.
[00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:53.790]  You're Bubble Girl.
[00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:57.652]  You're drinking all this GMO milk, eating GMO food.
[00:47:57.652 --> 00:48:02.435]  Mommy doesn't let you go out and dig in the dirt.
[00:48:02.435 --> 00:48:04.055]  All you're eating is processed foods.
[00:48:04.055 --> 00:48:06.857]  I mean, you are a wreck!
[00:48:06.857 --> 00:48:08.298]  You are a wreck!
[00:48:08.298 --> 00:48:08.378]  And
[00:48:09.696 --> 00:48:15.081]  It's been estimated by scientific studies that we all get cancer every day, even when we're young.
[00:48:15.081 --> 00:48:19.464]  By the time we're old, we're contracting cancer.
[00:48:19.464 --> 00:48:25.309]  It's developing the body hundreds of times a day in studies, but your body beats it all day long.
[00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:26.330]  That's another issue.
[00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:30.093]  You start suppressing and confusing the immune system.
[00:48:30.093 --> 00:48:32.055]  You're like, well, Alex, why would a trash truck driver
[00:48:33.343 --> 00:48:38.187]  Or a doctor have such high immunity because they're around bacteria and viruses all day.
[00:48:38.187 --> 00:48:41.429]  But then why would a vaccine that have the opposite effect?
[00:48:41.429 --> 00:48:54.219]  Because when you're a doctor or you're a trash truck driver, you're not injecting the blood and the viruses and the bacteria through your defense system.
[00:48:54.219 --> 00:48:57.382]  You are, it's going into your sinuses.
[00:48:57.382 --> 00:48:59.063]  It's going into your eyes.
[00:48:59.063 --> 00:49:00.084]  It's going into your mouth.
[00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:06.274]  That's why sexually transmitted diseases are so dangerous, because they're getting past your defenses.
[00:49:06.274 --> 00:49:14.602]  That's why people that have unnatural sex transmit diseases so much, whether they be male or female, because that isn't designed for it.
[00:49:15.495 --> 00:49:16.575]  And there's no defenses.
[00:49:16.575 --> 00:49:18.316]  It goes right into you.
[00:49:18.316 --> 00:49:23.078]  But when it goes into the sinus, or the eyes, or the mouth, the body's geared up.
[00:49:23.078 --> 00:49:27.599]  It's got its special forces, white blood cell commanders, the telemphysites and others.
[00:49:27.599 --> 00:49:28.880]  They're all there.
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:31.961]  And, you know, the crack frontline troops are there, and they're assessing.
[00:49:31.961 --> 00:49:32.721]  Look at this!
[00:49:32.721 --> 00:49:33.481]  Alright, deal with it!
[00:49:33.481 --> 00:49:34.161]  Take it out!
[00:49:34.161 --> 00:49:34.702]  Got another one!
[00:49:34.702 --> 00:49:35.462]  Take it out!
[00:49:35.462 --> 00:49:38.323]  Because the body's designed to have it on the skin.
[00:49:38.323 --> 00:49:40.884]  The bacteria, the viruses, everything else.
[00:49:41.644 --> 00:49:47.288]  The toxins, and the body's designed to deal with that on the skin, the mucous membranes.
[00:49:47.288 --> 00:50:09.043]  It's not designed with your little newborn baby with them to come in with six different shots with huge ampoules filled with mercury, aluminum, RNA, you know, you name it, chemicals, and just pumping the baby, just pumping the baby full of all of this directly through its defenses, right into its muscles, right into its bloodstream.
[00:50:10.808 --> 00:50:12.870]  It doesn't know how to handle it.
[00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:14.672]  It can't handle it.
[00:50:14.672 --> 00:50:16.254]  And then mama does something even worse.
[00:50:16.254 --> 00:50:18.095]  She doesn't breastfeed the baby.
[00:50:18.095 --> 00:50:19.277]  I'm not judging you if you didn't.
[00:50:19.277 --> 00:50:21.198]  I'm just educating you.
[00:50:21.198 --> 00:50:32.490]  With the tens of thousands of years of vaccines, every immunity that your great-great-great-great grandma in Scotland had, you know, to the smallpox or the chicken pox.
[00:50:33.792 --> 00:50:40.357]  Or your great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great grandmother in, you know, Southern Africa.
[00:50:40.357 --> 00:50:48.223]  Every immunity, everything she fought through, everything she survived is passed on through that colostrum.
[00:50:48.223 --> 00:50:54.889]  Tens of thousands of vaccines coming right out of mama, right into that baby, supercharging it!
[00:50:54.889 --> 00:50:55.829]  What do they tell you?
[00:50:55.829 --> 00:50:59.352]  Let's give them some baby formula that's 52% sugar.
[00:50:59.352 --> 00:50:59.993]  Let's give them that.
[00:51:00.655 --> 00:51:02.436]  Normal blood pressure, naturally.
[00:51:02.436 --> 00:51:03.777]  How would that make you feel?
[00:51:03.777 --> 00:51:05.498]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[00:51:05.498 --> 00:51:08.040]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:15.604]  Then my real health began going downhill, and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[00:51:15.604 --> 00:51:17.085]  I was a mess, pretty much.
[00:51:17.085 --> 00:51:19.847]  Don reports dramatic improvements with heart and body extract.
[00:51:19.847 --> 00:51:25.150]  I started taking heart and body extract, and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better.
[00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:30.193]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[00:51:30.373 --> 00:51:35.475]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.

[00:51:44.598 --> 00:51:47.979]  Folks, I did not expect this at all.
[00:51:47.979 --> 00:51:52.681]  By the 7th, 8th, and 9th day, I saw dramatic improvements from taking Heart and Body Extract.

[00:52:04.426 --> 00:52:05.687]  Tyranny is here.
[00:52:05.687 --> 00:52:09.550]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:52:09.550 --> 00:52:11.852]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:52:11.852 --> 00:52:17.716]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:52:17.716 --> 00:52:23.941]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:52:24.381 --> 00:52:30.364]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:52:30.364 --> 00:52:34.525]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:52:34.525 --> 00:52:38.827]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:52:38.827 --> 00:52:44.769]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:52:44.769 --> 00:52:48.331]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:52:48.331 --> 00:52:50.292]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:52:50.292 --> 00:52:50.732]  It's here.

[00:54:20.418 --> 00:54:22.239]  Pre-speech.
[00:54:22.239 --> 00:54:22.979]  Here's another one.
[00:54:22.979 --> 00:54:27.002]  Obama administration pressures ISPs to censor websites.
[00:54:27.002 --> 00:54:29.483]  Here's the LA Times last night.
[00:54:29.483 --> 00:54:32.145]  Unless you think we're exaggerating.
[00:54:32.145 --> 00:54:35.707]  Justices appear set to limit funeral protests.
[00:54:35.707 --> 00:54:40.710]  And then later, they've got the justices quoting saying this will affect the internet.
[00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:42.971]  If you offend someone, they can sue you.
[00:54:45.823 --> 00:54:50.384]  And that ties into the British laws being passed.
[00:54:50.384 --> 00:54:51.824]  Trolling someone online?
[00:54:51.824 --> 00:54:54.925]  Bill would slap you with jail time.
[00:54:54.925 --> 00:54:55.945]  Here's the mail.
[00:54:55.945 --> 00:54:57.305]  Death of the office joke.
[00:54:57.305 --> 00:55:06.847]  Coalition enacts PC equality law, which means anyone can sue for anything that offends them, even if it's not about them.
[00:55:06.847 --> 00:55:11.008]  Meanwhile, thousands of illegal immigrants escape deportation because police fear being called racist.
[00:55:11.977 --> 00:55:15.219]  See, this is how they paralyze you with political correctness.
[00:55:15.219 --> 00:55:16.259]  That's coming up.
[00:55:16.259 --> 00:55:17.940]  But I promised to go to calls.
[00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:25.283]  So I want to go to Mark and Dorothy and Paul and Alex and Michael and Tanya and others that are patiently holding.
[00:55:25.283 --> 00:55:27.544]  I've got a bunch of other news as well.
[00:55:27.544 --> 00:55:31.426]  And some key video clips are going to be playing where Beck admits that they want to poison the water.
[00:55:31.426 --> 00:55:32.927]  Well, they don't want to poison the water.
[00:55:32.927 --> 00:55:34.928]  They're doing it, Jack.
[00:55:34.928 --> 00:55:38.729]  OK, so we're going to be talking about that as well.
[00:55:38.729 --> 00:55:39.950]  But just putting in
[00:55:41.667 --> 00:55:52.138]  Bookend on what I was talking about with milk, colostrum in the first few weeks especially, is filled with all the mother's immunity.
[00:55:52.138 --> 00:56:03.651]  When the baby starts growing on the placenta in the uterus, the placenta is literally a complex filter to block, that's why many women can have HIV or other diseases and it's not passed on to the baby.
[00:56:05.003 --> 00:56:05.203]  I think?
[00:56:26.764 --> 00:56:38.996]  Then gives milk to the baby full of protein and fats and natural sugars and it's filled with every immunity in her entire genetic line.
[00:56:38.996 --> 00:56:43.341]  I mean it's just off the charts what is in colostrum.
[00:56:44.722 --> 00:56:45.623]  Off the charts.
[00:57:01.385 --> 00:57:09.951]  Nursemaids who would take care of their babies who were just basically constantly producing milk, almost like a milk cow, for the elite's children so they wouldn't have to breastfeed.
[00:57:09.951 --> 00:57:19.437]  But they would have special ones who were timed to have a baby themselves where they had a whole, basically a stable of these women.
[00:57:19.437 --> 00:57:24.780]  So they would always have a woman who was just about to give birth or who had just given birth to get that.
[00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:27.382]  I mean, they knew thousands of years ago that milk
[00:57:27.822 --> 00:57:34.266]  Coming out of a woman who just had a baby is gold for health.
[00:57:34.266 --> 00:57:36.628]  It's a natural vaccine.
[00:57:36.628 --> 00:57:39.770]  It's a natural immunity booster.
[00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:43.453]  And all the major studies, you can pull these up, show that women are heartier than men.
[00:57:44.224 --> 00:57:45.485]  That's why they live longer.
[00:57:45.485 --> 00:57:49.807]  Women have higher tolerances to every disease known.
[00:57:49.807 --> 00:57:55.691]  Women are tough stuff, ladies and gentlemen, because they are designed to create life.
[00:57:55.691 --> 00:57:57.112]  They are designed to grow it.
[00:57:57.112 --> 00:57:58.572]  They are designed to take care of it.
[00:57:58.572 --> 00:58:02.935]  Women are just, just, just, just boiling with power.
[00:58:02.935 --> 00:58:05.757]  Boiling with life force and energy.
[00:58:06.537 --> 00:58:21.942]  Okay, but instead, the baby is shot up with a bunch of shots, and then formula that's 40 plus percent corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, and 10 percent regular sugar.
[00:58:21.942 --> 00:58:23.062]  That's what's given to the baby.
[00:58:24.249 --> 00:58:27.451]  And they convince women it's high-tech, it's Buck Rogers, it's science.
[00:58:27.451 --> 00:58:28.272]  Give your baby this.
[00:58:28.272 --> 00:58:33.355]  And then all the studies show, babies who are not breastfed have smaller CC-sized brains.
[00:58:33.355 --> 00:58:35.236]  The baby needs your milk.
[00:58:35.236 --> 00:58:36.917]  This has been a public service announcement.
[00:58:36.917 --> 00:58:42.160]  We'll be right back with your phone calls.
[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:43.501]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:43.501 --> 00:58:46.883]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:51.846 --> 00:58:55.868]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:58:55.868 --> 00:58:59.110]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:58:59.110 --> 00:59:03.913]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:59:03.913 --> 00:59:10.096]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:59:10.296 --> 00:59:15.263]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:59:25.598 --> 00:59:27.940]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:29.521]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:59:29.521 --> 00:59:31.983]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:59:31.983 --> 00:59:34.104]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:59:34.104 --> 00:59:39.268]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:59:39.268 --> 00:59:48.374]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:53.604 --> 00:59:56.005]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.005 --> 01:00:05.348]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.348 --> 01:00:06.649]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.649 --> 01:00:08.409]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.409 --> 01:00:09.590]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.590 --> 01:00:11.750]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:12.711]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.711 --> 01:00:17.492]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.492 --> 01:00:21.574]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:28.402]  We are now into our number two.
[01:00:28.402 --> 01:00:30.144]  We're going to get into the economic news.
[01:00:30.144 --> 01:00:32.466]  We're going to get into the latest health care and immigration news.
[01:00:32.466 --> 01:00:35.229]  The big attacks on the First Amendment.
[01:00:35.229 --> 01:00:40.654]  Huge national news reporting on plans to put poison in the water to sterilize you and your family.
[01:00:40.654 --> 01:00:44.097]  It is all coming up in this hour, but let's get through a bunch of your calls right now.
[01:00:44.097 --> 01:00:47.220]  Mark in Colorado, you're on the air.
[01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:48.001]  Hello, Alex.
[01:00:48.001 --> 01:00:48.742]  I'm loving the show.
[01:00:50.297 --> 01:00:52.218]  I've heard of you before, but never really listened.
[01:00:52.218 --> 01:00:56.822]  And then I heard you a couple times on, I hate to say it, a competitor, but Man Cow Show.
[01:00:56.822 --> 01:00:57.522]  Yeah, that's fine.
[01:00:57.522 --> 01:00:58.543]  It's not a competitor.
[01:00:58.543 --> 01:01:03.507]  Listen, I'm not in competition with anybody.
[01:01:03.507 --> 01:01:07.470]  So, I mean, I've had Man Cow on the show here.
[01:01:07.470 --> 01:01:08.171]  Okay.
[01:01:08.171 --> 01:01:14.196]  Well, I just started listening to you about a week ago, so I'm kind of nervous.
[01:01:14.196 --> 01:01:19.260]  I already have my passport and was wondering if I should stay in the United States or try to move somewhere else.
[01:01:20.219 --> 01:01:26.425]  I was thinking Switzerland or New Zealand, and I was wondering what you thought about that, and I just started doing research.
[01:01:26.425 --> 01:01:29.408]  Do you have three million dollars?
[01:01:29.408 --> 01:01:30.249]  No.
[01:01:30.249 --> 01:01:32.071]  Well, Switzerland's not gonna let you in.
[01:01:32.071 --> 01:01:33.992]  Do you have half a million?
[01:01:33.992 --> 01:01:34.092]  No.
[01:01:37.762 --> 01:01:37.942]  Yeah.
[01:01:55.523 --> 01:01:57.244]  But there's nowhere to really run.
[01:01:57.244 --> 01:01:58.905]  We stand and we fight.
[01:01:58.905 --> 01:02:03.607]  The United States is still one of the best countries in the world.
[01:02:03.607 --> 01:02:05.467]  This is a global corporate tyranny.
[01:02:05.467 --> 01:02:10.309]  Everything you see happening here is happening to the same degree or worse.
[01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.950]  Or worse!
[01:02:12.059 --> 01:02:12.339]  Awesome.
[01:02:12.339 --> 01:02:14.141]  I just wanted to get your opinion and see what you thought.
[01:02:42.585 --> 01:02:43.766]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[01:02:43.766 --> 01:02:57.096]  I mean, the only way to leave the country is if you're fleeing some false charges or if you're a public figure who you know is going to be exterminated when they execute Order No.
[01:02:57.096 --> 01:02:58.818]  66.
[01:02:58.818 --> 01:03:00.459]  That's a Revenge of the Sith quote.
[01:03:00.459 --> 01:03:01.400]  Execute Order No. 66.
[01:03:03.637 --> 01:03:07.719]  And believe me, the government admits they have orders like Order No.
[01:03:07.719 --> 01:03:11.461]  66, called the Red List, but they're not going to get away with the Red List.
[01:03:11.461 --> 01:03:22.245]  They could detonate a nuke in Chicago and say, you know, that a guy with a turbine did it, or say that I did it, and, you know, they're not going to be able to go after everybody, because no one believes anything they're saying.
[01:03:22.245 --> 01:03:23.806]  They've lost all credibility.
[01:03:23.806 --> 01:03:27.468]  And that's why they're really... We're in a bad position, but so are the controllers, because
[01:03:28.268 --> 01:03:41.355]  They've got control of the system, but now they're uncloaked, everybody sees them, and so they're trying to accelerate their total takeover, and that's only revealing them more, and so we're kind of in a Mexican standoff.
[01:03:41.355 --> 01:03:43.076]  You know a Mexican standoff?
[01:03:43.076 --> 01:03:47.138]  Yeah, that's where two guys are sitting there pointing guns at each other.
[01:03:48.922 --> 01:03:55.204]  And I guess there's a more complex Mexican standoff where you've got five or six people, you know, different groups with guns pointed at everybody.
[01:03:55.204 --> 01:03:57.485]  And we're now reaching that point.
[01:03:57.485 --> 01:04:06.648]  That's what happens with World War I, World War II, World War III coming, whether it's economic or, I mean, you can see it all coming together, is somebody just starts, somebody pulls the trigger.
[01:04:06.648 --> 01:04:13.751]  A Mexican standoff, the best example of a Mexican standoff would be the good, the bad, and the ugly with Lee Van Cleef and, of course,
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:40.412]  Clint Eastwood and you know there's three guys at the end the good the bad and the ugly and they're all at the cemetery where the gold's buried and they've all got guns on each other and they don't know who's gonna draw first and then finally Lee Van Cleef draws and Clint Eastwood's taking the bullets out of Tuco's gun so he can't do anything but then he notices Tuco
[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:42.662]  Didn't shoot at him.
[01:04:42.662 --> 01:04:43.903]  He shot at the bad guy.
[01:04:43.903 --> 01:04:46.006]  So he goes ahead and gives Tuco his gold.
[01:04:46.006 --> 01:04:47.347]  But he doesn't trust Tuco.
[01:04:47.347 --> 01:04:50.851]  He ties him up first and says, all right, here's your gold.
[01:04:50.851 --> 01:04:58.981]  He actually puts him in a noose hanging by a rope and then rides off into the distance and shoots the rope as he's standing on top one of the gravestones.
[01:04:59.622 --> 01:05:00.523]  We'll be back.
[01:05:00.523 --> 01:05:05.066]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:05.066 --> 01:05:05.987]  Number 1.
[01:05:05.987 --> 01:05:09.410]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.410 --> 01:05:10.270]  Number 2.
[01:05:10.270 --> 01:05:15.154]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:15.154 --> 01:05:15.915]  It's true.
[01:05:15.915 --> 01:05:20.779]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:20.779 --> 01:05:21.599]  Number 3.
[01:05:21.599 --> 01:05:25.182]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:25.182 --> 01:05:28.865]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:29.085 --> 01:05:29.886]  Number 4.
[01:05:29.886 --> 01:05:32.648]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:32.648 --> 01:05:36.331]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:36.331 --> 01:05:37.112]  Number 5.
[01:05:37.112 --> 01:05:41.256]  A solar-powered generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:41.256 --> 01:05:46.040]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:06:10.948 --> 01:06:18.335]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:06:18.335 --> 01:06:23.219]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:06:36.129 --> 01:06:42.891]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:06:42.891 --> 01:06:46.772]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[01:08:11.972 --> 01:08:13.514]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.514 --> 01:08:17.718]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.718 --> 01:08:24.044]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:24.044 --> 01:08:25.766]  Okay, I've been babbling, coming.
[01:08:27.671 --> 01:08:28.111]  Hi Alex.
[01:08:28.111 --> 01:08:29.012]  Oh good to hear from you, or talk to you.
[01:08:29.012 --> 01:08:30.113]  I've been a listener for two years now.
[01:08:49.281 --> 01:08:51.643]  Uh, there's so many points I want to get to.
[01:08:51.643 --> 01:08:59.790]  I know you only have limited time, but the main one is that a few weeks back, they were saying Obama's going to come out with secrets about aliens or whatever.
[01:08:59.790 --> 01:09:00.590]  Then the U.N.
[01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:01.271]  thing.
[01:09:01.271 --> 01:09:09.577]  But they've been doing a monthly alert system, your siren that goes off Saturday at 1 o'clock every afternoon.
[01:09:09.577 --> 01:09:10.518]  Uh, E.T.
[01:09:10.518 --> 01:09:10.798]  thing.
[01:09:10.798 --> 01:09:12.380]  You know that?
[01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:13.341]  That E.T.
[01:09:13.341 --> 01:09:15.042]  do-do-do-do-do-do.
[01:09:15.848 --> 01:09:19.650]  Hey, Dorothy, I want to be able to talk to you, but your phone's really breaking up.
[01:09:19.650 --> 01:09:24.733]  But are you talking about emergency alert systems that take over the TVs and radios?
[01:09:24.733 --> 01:09:25.353]  Yes.
[01:09:25.353 --> 01:09:26.373]  Can you hear me better now?
[01:09:26.373 --> 01:09:27.514]  Yes.
[01:09:27.514 --> 01:09:29.475]  Okay, because I've got the speaker.
[01:09:29.475 --> 01:09:32.196]  But, yeah, that's what they've been doing.
[01:09:32.196 --> 01:09:35.358]  For the last three weeks, I've been noticing it, or the last three months.
[01:09:36.758 --> 01:09:51.765]  Yes, going back until 1996 when they really took over the whole telecommunications system completely, you would have a local designated TV and radio stations that would receive the federal bulletins, but under the
[01:09:52.805 --> 01:09:52.925]  Tell
[01:10:08.454 --> 01:10:32.814]  Not just, you know, to test the system, but for missing children, or, you know, things that sounded reasonable, the whole Amber Alert, but now it's pay your carbon taxes, today's an ozone action day, tattle on your neighbor, and now I see the billboards, you know, saying report terrorism, report suspicious activity, the big electronic billboards that are on the highways, that's part of the system, and yeah, they're gearing up more and more
[01:10:33.915 --> 01:10:39.099]  And training people to accept government takeover of media.
[01:10:39.099 --> 01:10:48.766]  And that's what the Cybersecurity Act does, is just basically unveils and comes out in the open with the fact that they also need the power to, quote, shut the web down whenever they want.
[01:10:48.766 --> 01:11:01.476]  Or one example they gave in the legislation was, during last year's flu emergency, direct all websites in the United States to the government sites about the flu.
[01:11:02.216 --> 01:11:07.401]  So it's just basically they're able to flip a switch and send the internet to where they want.
[01:11:07.401 --> 01:11:10.243]  And that's what this whole grid is, Dorothy.
[01:11:10.243 --> 01:11:11.344]  Right.
[01:11:11.344 --> 01:11:15.267]  It's been going on, you know, for the whole city to hear it.
[01:11:15.267 --> 01:11:19.251]  Where it sounds like the E.T., you know, on the movie where
[01:11:21.687 --> 01:11:26.990]  You know, the tone that they were using when E.T., the mothership came in, doo doo doo doo.
[01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:28.551]  Yes, I've actually heard similar.
[01:11:28.551 --> 01:11:30.833]  Yeah, now they've put it in all major cities.
[01:11:30.833 --> 01:11:33.154]  First time I heard them was about six years ago in Chicago.
[01:11:33.154 --> 01:11:36.496]  I'm walking around and I hear air raid sirens being tested.
[01:11:36.496 --> 01:11:38.377]  And I'm in downtown Chicago.
[01:11:38.377 --> 01:11:40.979]  And then it's going, we are at an orange alert.
[01:11:40.979 --> 01:11:42.080]  We're at an orange alert.
[01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:44.261]  And it was like they turned the whole city into an airport.
[01:11:44.261 --> 01:11:47.363]  Kind of like we were walking through the airport and you hear, we're now at a yellow alert.
[01:11:47.703 --> 01:11:49.445]  Please watch for suspicious packages.
[01:11:49.445 --> 01:11:51.527]  And guys with machine guns are walking by.
[01:11:51.527 --> 01:11:54.169]  Meanwhile, their bosses stage the terror attack.
[01:11:54.169 --> 01:11:55.271]  Very spooky, Dorothy.
[01:11:55.271 --> 01:11:58.514]  Shoot some video of it and post it on the web or send it to us.
[01:11:58.514 --> 01:12:02.277]  But I have seen mainstream news articles about that intensifying.
[01:12:02.277 --> 01:12:06.702]  And they tried this in 89 through the FCC, but it didn't go through Congress.
[01:12:06.702 --> 01:12:09.464]  The FCC tried to regulate it, but Congress said no.
[01:12:10.345 --> 01:12:10.985]  We're good to go.
[01:12:29.170 --> 01:12:39.399]  They've made it optional now where you can buy a clock radio for your house that plugs in the wall, it's not hooked to the internet or anything, and it says, oh, this has emergency weather alerts on it.
[01:12:39.399 --> 01:12:53.471]  Well, that means it's got the chip in it to turn it on on its own, just like they want to control your thermostats, just like they, you know, want cameras in all the cars to, quote, watch to see if you look like you're agitated or angry, or if a child's in the car, not in a seatbelt.
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:57.907]  They're just announcing this total surveillance grid, Dorothy.
[01:12:57.907 --> 01:12:58.909]  Really interesting question.
[01:12:58.909 --> 01:12:59.971]  That's why I love taking calls.
[01:12:59.971 --> 01:13:01.355]  They take us in different directions.
[01:13:01.355 --> 01:13:02.998]  Let's talk to Paul in California.
[01:13:02.998 --> 01:13:03.720]  Paul, you're on the air.
[01:13:05.011 --> 01:13:09.433]  Hello Alex, I got two quick suggestions to help the cause.
[01:13:09.433 --> 01:13:13.354]  One that you can do, and one that the people can do.
[01:13:13.354 --> 01:13:19.896]  The first one is, how about a deck of cards with all the major Illuminati players on it?
[01:13:19.896 --> 01:13:20.676]  That's been done.
[01:13:20.676 --> 01:13:26.198]  I mean, there's gotta be more than ten different companies that have done that, and it is a good idea.
[01:13:26.198 --> 01:13:29.139]  And the second thing is, I found this one out by mistake.
[01:13:29.139 --> 01:13:31.160]  I was summoned to do jury duty.
[01:13:31.852 --> 01:13:45.020]  And when they got up there to select the jurors, I kind of read them the lie attack, and it's a pretty good way to voice your opinion and get it recorded on some of the bills that go on in the country.
[01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:47.101]  So what'd you say to them, Paul?
[01:13:47.101 --> 01:13:57.847]  Well, they said, this case will involve Los Angeles police officers, and do you think this will interfere with your judgment on the case?
[01:13:57.847 --> 01:13:58.348]  And I said,
[01:13:59.187 --> 01:14:03.869]  I kind of snickered because they were asking it to a juror, a potential juror beside me.
[01:14:03.869 --> 01:14:07.911]  So I snickered and the lawyer caught it and he says, oh, I saw you snicker.
[01:14:07.911 --> 01:14:12.293]  Do you think that the Los Angeles police officers might lie on the stand?
[01:14:12.293 --> 01:14:14.134]  And I said, only if they're talking.
[01:14:14.134 --> 01:14:19.796]  And the whole, you could hear a pin drop in the whole room, you know, about 150 people there.
[01:14:19.796 --> 01:14:27.040]  Did you see the story yesterday where two cops robbed an undercover cop to steal his drugs and money?
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:27.760]  I mean, it's just...
[01:14:29.622 --> 01:14:31.303]  Our officers wouldn't do that.
[01:14:31.303 --> 01:14:34.285]  Don't listen to Thomas Jefferson when he said don't trust the government.
[01:14:34.285 --> 01:14:37.827]  We should give all the power over and give up all our rights.
[01:14:37.827 --> 01:14:39.748]  They'll keep us safe.
[01:14:39.748 --> 01:14:41.048]  Yep, yep, exactly.
[01:14:41.048 --> 01:14:42.469]  So what happened next?
[01:14:42.469 --> 01:14:44.190]  So what happened next?
[01:14:44.190 --> 01:14:51.274]  Well, basically what happened was they asked me a couple more questions because they were so shocked at what I said.
[01:14:54.943 --> 01:15:00.794]  I think I went overboard, actually, because I couldn't believe I was saying what I was saying.
[01:15:00.794 --> 01:15:04.260]  And let me guess, you didn't get the jury
[01:15:05.885 --> 01:15:06.846]  You didn't get picked for the jury?
[01:15:06.846 --> 01:15:19.456]  Oh, no, I mean, I walked out of there, they pretended like, oh, and they went to the next one, but then when it came up to my turn to, you know, they said, okay, we can dismiss this potential juror.
[01:15:19.456 --> 01:15:27.382]  And as I was leaving, the judge said goodbye in a very, you know, sarcastic manner.
[01:15:28.263 --> 01:15:35.895]  And uh, you know, as I walked out of there, it was almost like one of those scenes where you beat up everyone in the bar, and you walk out, and everyone just steps aside.
[01:15:35.895 --> 01:15:43.426]  You know, I mean, everyone was just shocked, and uh, you know, there's obviously police officers in there, and uh, you know.
[01:15:43.926 --> 01:15:44.607]  I just didn't care.
[01:16:02.085 --> 01:16:02.905]  Hey, what's happening Alex?
[01:16:24.918 --> 01:16:25.639]  Not much, brother.
[01:16:25.639 --> 01:16:28.261]  I want to give a shout out to my brother in Michigan, Dylan, real quick.
[01:16:28.261 --> 01:16:31.223]  I want to say I'm a huge fan of your work, man.
[01:16:31.223 --> 01:16:35.706]  I wanted to tell you about what happened to me last month, man, on the 23rd of September.
[01:16:35.706 --> 01:16:49.157]  It was like 1 o'clock in the morning, I'm driving to pick up a pack of cigarettes, and I got my 9-11 with an inside job t-shirt on, and I get pulled over, and the cop comes up to me, you know, registration ID,
[01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:51.301]  And he asked me to search the car.
[01:16:51.301 --> 01:16:52.682]  And I was like, yeah, go right ahead.
[01:16:52.682 --> 01:16:54.364]  And on the back seat, I'm in college.
[01:16:54.364 --> 01:16:55.385]  Well, let me stop you.
[01:16:55.385 --> 01:16:56.906]  Let me stop you.
[01:16:56.906 --> 01:16:59.088]  It's not that you have something to hide.
[01:16:59.088 --> 01:17:02.731]  It's that in a police state, you can't trust many officers.
[01:17:02.731 --> 01:17:04.633]  And I bet you discovered that.
[01:17:04.633 --> 01:17:06.154]  And, you know, to do the right thing.
[01:17:06.154 --> 01:17:07.555]  But it's your Fourth Amendment.
[01:17:07.555 --> 01:17:11.959]  You can't let them set the precedent to search your car whenever they want.
[01:17:11.959 --> 01:17:12.880]  You need to tell them no.
[01:17:14.241 --> 01:17:15.302]  And then they say, what do you have to hide?
[01:17:15.302 --> 01:17:16.142]  I go, what do you have to hide?
[01:17:16.142 --> 01:17:17.363]  Let me search your car.
[01:17:17.363 --> 01:17:18.003]  You know, come on.
[01:17:18.003 --> 01:17:20.785]  I mean, if you got to, you know, why are you pulling me over?
[01:17:20.785 --> 01:17:22.026]  It's the Fourth Amendment.
[01:17:22.026 --> 01:17:25.047]  So he found something he didn't like in the backseat.
[01:17:25.047 --> 01:17:30.551]  Yeah, I'm doing a college report and I'm doing it on about how 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:17:30.551 --> 01:17:34.733]  And it happened to be flipped open to the page about nanothermite.
[01:17:34.733 --> 01:17:37.635]  And next, he thought you were a terrorist.
[01:17:37.635 --> 01:17:38.315]  Yes, sir.
[01:17:38.315 --> 01:17:39.996]  He's like, you know, so what are you playing?
[01:17:39.996 --> 01:17:41.157]  What do you plan on blowing up?
[01:17:41.539 --> 01:17:45.942]  You know, and he's like looking at my shirt, him and his partner flashing lights on my shirt.
[01:17:45.942 --> 01:17:48.244]  And he's like, so what, are you unpatriotic or something?
[01:17:48.244 --> 01:17:56.751]  And so they're so stupid, they think that if you believe 9-11's an inside job, because the evidence clearly shows that, that then you want to blow something up.
[01:17:56.751 --> 01:17:58.252]  And that comes from Glenn Beck.
[01:17:58.252 --> 01:18:04.257]  He puts out the talking point that 9-11 truthers basically want to blow things up when it's the opposite.
[01:18:04.257 --> 01:18:05.538]  So, I mean,
[01:18:06.258 --> 01:18:15.003]  If you watch the film Fall of the Republic, we have the internal police video training where they say, you know, basically anybody could be a terrorist.
[01:18:15.003 --> 01:18:19.345]  And they put you in databases, so they're turning them into federalized little secret police.
[01:18:19.345 --> 01:18:21.567]  How did this end?
[01:18:21.567 --> 01:18:28.450]  He wound up letting me go with a warning, but I mean, after 10 minutes of harassing... A warning for what?
[01:18:28.450 --> 01:18:30.992]  For, I don't know, brake light being out or something.
[01:18:32.242 --> 01:18:34.665]  I forget why the initial reason him pulling me over.
[01:18:48.098 --> 01:18:59.160]  See, because Americans are so nice, and we have a lot of hospitality, but a lot of cops take it, if you're being nice and almost submissive, like you're guilty.
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:02.041]  I'm like, hey, you like drinking sodium fluoride?
[01:19:02.041 --> 01:19:04.402]  Search the term fluoride cancer.
[01:19:04.402 --> 01:19:05.302]  And don't laugh at me.
[01:19:05.302 --> 01:19:06.662]  Look, it's not funny, officer.
[01:19:06.662 --> 01:19:07.842]  I care about you.
[01:19:07.842 --> 01:19:09.063]  I care about your family.
[01:19:09.063 --> 01:19:10.943]  You're being assaulted by a chemical weapon.
[01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:15.886]  Now if you care about your family, you search that when you're off duty tonight.
[01:19:15.886 --> 01:19:22.975]  And I can't believe, I can't believe that you are getting in my face about my political views and ideas.
[01:19:22.975 --> 01:19:24.277]  What is this, the Soviet Union?
[01:19:25.305 --> 01:19:28.267]  And if they start getting in your face, go, hey, you do whatever you're going to do to me.
[01:19:28.267 --> 01:19:28.827]  Beat me up.
[01:19:28.827 --> 01:19:29.728]  Take me to jail.
[01:19:29.728 --> 01:19:30.968]  I'm a real American.
[01:19:30.968 --> 01:19:32.149]  I'm a good person.
[01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:36.252]  That's what I told that state police Yosemite Sam guy out there running some checkpoint.
[01:19:36.252 --> 01:19:37.152]  I politely parked.
[01:19:37.152 --> 01:19:38.173]  It's in a neighborhood.
[01:19:38.173 --> 01:19:38.633]  Walk over.
[01:19:38.633 --> 01:19:39.314]  Hi, officers.
[01:19:39.314 --> 01:19:40.314]  What's going on?
[01:19:40.314 --> 01:19:41.315]  Get out of here.
[01:19:41.315 --> 01:19:42.876]  It's none of your business.
[01:19:42.876 --> 01:19:43.936]  They didn't have anybody pulled over.
[01:19:43.936 --> 01:19:44.557]  Nothing.
[01:19:44.557 --> 01:19:46.118]  I said, well, you're being pretty rude to me right now.
[01:19:47.475 --> 01:19:48.556]  And you know, I just let him know.
[01:19:48.556 --> 01:19:53.580]  I said, listen, you're living in tyranny, buddy, and the tyranny you're putting on me is going to come back on you.

[01:21:04.815 --> 01:21:06.076]  Tyranny is here.
[01:21:06.076 --> 01:21:09.819]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:21:09.819 --> 01:21:12.241]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:21:12.241 --> 01:21:18.106]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:21:18.106 --> 01:21:24.771]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:21:24.771 --> 01:21:30.776]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:21:30.776 --> 01:21:34.459]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.

[01:21:45.161 --> 01:21:48.702]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:21:48.702 --> 01:21:50.682]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:21:50.682 --> 01:21:51.802]  It's here.

[01:21:59.504 --> 01:22:00.305]  Gold.

[01:22:01.825 --> 01:22:08.109]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:22:08.109 --> 01:22:12.291]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:22:12.291 --> 01:22:14.232]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:22:14.232 --> 01:22:16.653]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:22:16.653 --> 01:22:24.337]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.

[01:23:28.875 --> 01:23:33.877]  Absolutely everything's on sale across the board, including our already discounted packages.
[01:23:33.877 --> 01:23:36.117]  And you know, the holidays are coming up fast.
[01:23:36.117 --> 01:23:38.498]  We don't know if we're going to have another sale this year.
[01:23:38.498 --> 01:23:39.639]  This was the only one in 2010 so far.
[01:23:40.939 --> 01:23:45.542]  We've been lucky to keep our prices the same since 2008, but who knows what the future will bring.
[01:23:45.542 --> 01:23:51.227]  So go to ofthefield.com now or call toll-free 1-888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:23:51.227 --> 01:23:56.090]  That's ofthefield.com or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE.

[01:24:04.896 --> 01:24:07.859]  We're sending out an SOS to free humanity.
[01:24:08.812 --> 01:24:10.573]  I want to be clear.
[01:24:10.573 --> 01:24:15.955]  Most police I meet are pro-Second Amendment, libertarian-minded good people.
[01:24:15.955 --> 01:24:34.363]  Some forces are more corrupt than others, but there's no doubt that the federal government that has almost completely federalized your local police is run by criminal banks and has evil intentions for all of us, and they're trying to train the police to be a bunch of bloodthirsty, you know, death squads against the citizens.
[01:24:35.183 --> 01:24:35.703]  Hello, Alex.
[01:24:59.161 --> 01:25:01.183]  Hi, I've been a listener since 2007.
[01:25:01.183 --> 01:25:17.575]  I just had a question, something I noticed, like I work for, I actually work at McCarron, it's owned by the government out here, and we have a lot of people, predominant politicians, people traveling all the time, and I talked to a guy, that I don't want to say his name, but he works for the pharmaceutical company,
[01:25:18.215 --> 01:25:20.780]  And I asked him last year, I said, what do you think of the H1N1?
[01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:27.090]  And he goes, oh, well, you know, it's great, you know, it really will help you.
[01:25:27.090 --> 01:25:28.833]  And I'm like, okay.
[01:25:28.833 --> 01:25:32.258]  So he goes, but next year when you get the shot, we're just going to put it in the shot.
[01:25:32.935 --> 01:25:37.238]  And that's now been announced and literally at Walmart they're giving out free shots.
[01:25:37.238 --> 01:25:40.260]  They're now giving free passes to topless bars.
[01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:41.681]  I have that in the news if you'll go.
[01:25:41.681 --> 01:25:46.344]  I was talking to some friends that were over this weekend and they said it was bizarre.
[01:25:46.344 --> 01:25:47.745]  It was like a horror movie.
[01:25:47.745 --> 01:25:57.492]  They were in a Walgreens and it was watching all these little kids getting marched in and you know everybody getting their shots and when she was at the cash register they were asking do you want a shot?
[01:25:57.492 --> 01:25:59.393]  I mean they are really pushing it.
[01:26:00.205 --> 01:26:04.447]  And you know, and he thought it was kind of odd when I go, and you think that's okay?
[01:26:04.447 --> 01:26:07.989]  And he just like started staring at me like, what's wrong with it?
[01:26:07.989 --> 01:26:10.871]  And I couldn't figure out why he thought that that was okay.
[01:26:11.462 --> 01:26:15.644]  Well, they admit the H1N1 was an extremely weak flu.
[01:26:15.644 --> 01:26:21.287]  There's something special in that vaccine, and it killed people in trials in Europe.
[01:26:21.287 --> 01:26:24.609]  So, that's one of these special vaccines they want to make sure you get.
[01:26:24.609 --> 01:26:26.891]  I would look out big time.
[01:26:26.891 --> 01:26:27.811]  And they admit it.
[01:26:27.811 --> 01:26:30.192]  I just saw a headline out of Australia.
[01:26:30.192 --> 01:26:32.574]  Australian government admits it's increasing seizures.
[01:26:33.134 --> 01:26:33.414]  I don't know.
[01:26:53.138 --> 01:27:01.122]  And also, um, the question I have is now, if they keep printing the dollar and it loses its value, do you think that's when they'll actually start the microchipping?
[01:27:01.122 --> 01:27:14.869]  Because I actually have, um, my sister's in the military, and she's been having a dream two nights in a row that when she watched television on the news in her life, she said they were saying, report to your nearest, um, microchipping post.
[01:27:15.763 --> 01:27:17.004]  And she goes, what do you think that means?
[01:27:17.004 --> 01:27:21.648]  And she goes, because they said they, our dollar is not a value in her dream.
[01:27:21.648 --> 01:27:24.070]  And that they can't, you know, the paper's worthless.
[01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:25.411]  So they went to microchipping.
[01:27:25.411 --> 01:27:26.152]  They set up posts.
[01:27:26.152 --> 01:27:28.014]  And I go, well, it's just a dream.
[01:27:28.014 --> 01:27:28.574]  But I don't know.
[01:27:28.574 --> 01:27:36.161]  I was thinking, you know, the more they print it, do you, do you really, you know, do you think they will start implementing the microchip?
[01:27:36.721 --> 01:27:40.682]  All right, let me break that down, Tanya, as we go to break here.
[01:27:40.682 --> 01:27:53.505]  We know that Verichip and the federal government and IBM have said that by 2020, they want the entire population to be microchip.
[01:27:53.505 --> 01:28:00.427]  They already got kids all over the country, retina scanning, thumb scanning, you name it, to be able to get their school lunches.
[01:28:00.427 --> 01:28:02.388]  It's going in grocery stores to buy and sell.
[01:28:03.536 --> 01:28:08.018]  Six years ago, the Mexican Attorney General made his employees take microchips.
[01:28:08.018 --> 01:28:12.101]  It's come out they've been testing the chip on some of the troops, but it's classified.
[01:28:12.101 --> 01:28:14.262]  And so we know that's their intention.
[01:28:14.262 --> 01:28:22.566]  But I think her prothetic dream, you know, I mean, maybe prothetic or prophetic.
[01:28:22.566 --> 01:28:31.691]  But the issue here is we know that the Federal Reserve has now become the second biggest owner of Treasuries.
[01:28:33.654 --> 01:28:39.198]  China's number one, it was Europe number two, and then Japan number three.
[01:28:39.198 --> 01:28:45.863]  Now the Federal Reserve, we'll put that back on screen, from zero hedge, and they've got the official government numbers there.
[01:28:45.863 --> 01:28:50.085]  It's official, the Fed is now the second largest holder of U.S.
[01:28:50.085 --> 01:28:50.906]  Treasury bonds.
[01:28:50.906 --> 01:28:54.969]  So, when they talk about the printing presses being turned up on high,
[01:28:56.172 --> 01:29:02.938]  They're not physically printing a bunch of money for you, which is still bad because it devalues the currency down the road.
[01:29:02.938 --> 01:29:09.123]  They're creating tens of trillions for the central banks to buy up whatever they want, namely U.S.
[01:29:09.123 --> 01:29:12.086]  Treasuries, and then they get paid interest on that.
[01:29:13.035 --> 01:29:18.160]  So the Federal Reserve, that's private, uses our tax money to then buy Treasury.
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:20.562]  So they control the entire spectrum.
[01:29:20.562 --> 01:29:25.847]  And people talk about how we're dependent on China because they're the biggest owner of our debt.
[01:29:25.847 --> 01:29:29.631]  The Federal Reserve, the private banking cartel, is now the second biggest owner.
[01:29:30.507 --> 01:29:35.310]  And they're above Congress, they can do whatever they want, and it's all fraudulent.
[01:29:35.310 --> 01:29:42.474]  So that's a very, very important point we're going to cover later with Judge Andrew Napolitano here on the broadcast today.
[01:29:42.474 --> 01:29:48.377]  We've got some key announcements coming up on the other side, a bunch of news dealing with the First Amendment, and a lot more.
[01:29:48.377 --> 01:29:51.159]  Please stay with us.
[01:29:51.159 --> 01:29:52.560]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:55.081]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.081 --> 01:29:57.763]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:32:00.267 --> 01:32:04.810]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:04.810 --> 01:32:05.731]  Number 1.
[01:32:05.731 --> 01:32:09.153]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:09.153 --> 01:32:10.014]  Number 2.
[01:32:10.014 --> 01:32:14.897]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:14.897 --> 01:32:15.637]  It's true.
[01:32:15.637 --> 01:32:20.521]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.521 --> 01:32:21.341]  Number 3.
[01:32:21.341 --> 01:32:24.923]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:24.923 --> 01:32:28.626]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:28.826 --> 01:32:29.626]  Number 4.
[01:32:29.626 --> 01:32:32.387]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:32.387 --> 01:32:36.069]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:36.069 --> 01:32:36.849]  Number 5.
[01:32:36.849 --> 01:32:40.991]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:40.991 --> 01:32:46.053]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:33:18.069 --> 01:33:25.492]  Okay, I've got to get to a bunch of news now, but we will get to Roxanne, Nick, Dan, Paul, and others that are holding.
[01:33:25.492 --> 01:33:34.635]  But time certainly flies, and we are now only about, what, three and four.
[01:33:34.635 --> 01:33:36.016]  We're only about
[01:33:37.403 --> 01:33:38.183]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[01:33:59.295 --> 01:34:10.905]  Until noon the next day, I'll do the first hour of the Friday show live, and then Paul Joseph Watson's gonna be sitting in via video Skype from the United Kingdom.
[01:34:10.905 --> 01:34:13.347]  So that is coming up.
[01:34:13.347 --> 01:34:24.517]  And I just wanted to tell you that I have shot, it's gotta be more than 50 video interviews the last two years, flying all over the country for my Eugenics film.
[01:34:24.517 --> 01:34:25.558]  And it's coming out next year.
[01:34:26.550 --> 01:34:28.351]  But this can't wait.
[01:34:28.351 --> 01:34:38.355]  We're going to air never-before-seen powerful video interviews during that 24-hour period, our 25-hour period.
[01:34:38.355 --> 01:34:49.679]  We're going to air at least eight of these with people like Alan Watt, Lord Christopher Monckton, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Dr. Sherry Tenpenny,
[01:34:51.340 --> 01:34:54.803]  The list just goes on and on with who we're going to have on the show.
[01:34:54.803 --> 01:34:56.824]  We're going to have live interviews with Max Keiser.
[01:34:56.824 --> 01:35:02.129]  We're going to have live interviews with Gerald Salente.
[01:35:02.129 --> 01:35:05.211]  We're going to have a live interview with David Icke.
[01:35:05.211 --> 01:35:15.359]  I mean, literally, it's going to be a jam-packed 24- or 25-hour transmission starting the 24th when the show kicks off at 11 a.m.
[01:35:15.359 --> 01:35:18.262]  Central, running right through to the next Friday show.
[01:35:19.022 --> 01:35:20.103]  Live.
[01:35:20.103 --> 01:35:35.990]  And we're working on this with our servers, trying to make PrisonPlanet.tv free for that day, where we can have a video box, you know, where people can watch what everybody who's a PrisonPlanet.tv member gets to see during that 25-hour period.
[01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:42.834]  The problem is we're looking at bandwidth, not the paying for it, but if it really takes off and you get
[01:35:44.244 --> 01:35:44.544]  You know what?
[01:36:00.453 --> 01:36:02.694]  Not just listening to the internet streams.
[01:36:02.694 --> 01:36:07.357]  We have hundreds of thousands a day that tune in just to the free internet streams at InfoWars.com.
[01:36:07.357 --> 01:36:28.390]  We're going to try that as well, because we're going to be obviously transmitting at PrisonPlanet.TV, but for radio listeners, you'll be able to hear the interviews with Paul Craig Roberts, Alan Watt, Jeffrey Smith, Katherine Austin Fitts, Dr. Childress, Tenpenny,
[01:36:29.748 --> 01:36:29.768]  I
[01:36:46.714 --> 01:36:52.438]  Uh, 26, 27, 27 hour marathon transmission.
[01:36:52.438 --> 01:37:01.405]  And obviously when we air 30 minute and hour long interviews, that'll give myself a chance to, you know, go sit on the couch or whatever, try to take a cat nap, but I could do.
[01:37:02.608 --> 01:37:06.250]  I could probably do 25 hours without even taking a call.
[01:37:06.250 --> 01:37:07.110]  I could talk forever.
[01:37:07.110 --> 01:37:09.972]  There's so much news and so much information.
[01:37:09.972 --> 01:37:12.693]  But that's the money bomb day, and we've raised about $46,000.
[01:37:12.693 --> 01:37:19.837]  I'd like to raise $100,000 just before the money bomb, so I'm confident that we can raise the additional $400,000.
[01:37:19.837 --> 01:37:21.458]  That sounds like a lot.
[01:37:21.458 --> 01:37:27.581]  It costs around $200,000 a month just to run this operation with the 20 employees and contractors.
[01:37:29.662 --> 01:37:30.183]  Bandwidth.
[01:37:48.971 --> 01:37:50.412]  Shell of the building.
[01:37:50.412 --> 01:37:51.253]  It was a warehouse.
[01:37:51.253 --> 01:37:59.238]  Now it's a fully, you know, completed office, except for the equipment and the furniture and the personnel and anybody who's running operation.
[01:37:59.238 --> 01:38:11.747]  If we hire three, four people at modest pay and with the rent next year and the equipment and everything and the bandwidth and the things associated with it and the consultants to come in and help us, you know, finish out the studio.
[01:38:12.850 --> 01:38:16.113]  Conservatively, $400,000 is what we need.
[01:38:16.113 --> 01:38:26.361]  $500,000, we could do it confidently and go, should we buy this new video switcher that's $20,000 and is not that good, or $50,000 and buy something awesome?
[01:38:26.361 --> 01:38:35.408]  You know, should we go with prosumer $3,000 cameras in here, or should we go to the next level and have it be a lot higher quality and spend $6,000 per camera?
[01:38:36.269 --> 01:38:41.873]  I mean, it's all really up to you, and we've got a special account that all the donations are going into.
[01:38:41.873 --> 01:38:46.516]  That way, 100% of it will be spent on the operation and what we're doing here.
[01:38:46.516 --> 01:38:57.463]  And it's obviously with videos and book sales and everything we do, I take part of that, you know, to run my own life and operation and put money back to be able to, you know, keep this place in place if there's a total, complete meltdown of society.
[01:38:57.463 --> 01:38:58.324]  And that's the big issue.
[01:38:58.324 --> 01:39:06.029]  We've got limited backup funds, and it's really a risk for us to finish this studio and launch these new operations because it will destroy our backup.
[01:39:06.630 --> 01:39:06.950]  We're good.
[01:39:26.591 --> 01:39:30.974]  If you're not doing well financially, and I know most people aren't doing well, don't give.
[01:39:30.974 --> 01:39:37.937]  We're not like one of those preachers telling old ladies, you're out of money, but give us money and God will bless you and everything will be okay.
[01:39:37.937 --> 01:39:40.859]  No, everything probably won't be all right.
[01:39:40.859 --> 01:39:45.262]  Certainly God does help people sometimes that give that don't have it, but I don't want that.
[01:39:45.262 --> 01:39:49.664]  I know that we have listeners who are worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:39:52.619 --> 01:39:58.641]  A lot of folks have pointed out I should go to some of the people I know and try to get them to donate, but I just, I don't know.
[01:39:58.641 --> 01:40:01.802]  The point is, is that, okay, step up, donate.
[01:40:01.802 --> 01:40:04.923]  I mean, maybe a million will come in, maybe four million like Ron Paul did.
[01:40:04.923 --> 01:40:06.583]  Can you imagine what we do with that?
[01:40:06.583 --> 01:40:08.364]  Can you imagine?
[01:40:08.364 --> 01:40:14.346]  Maybe I should just do a speaking tour like Glenn Beck does and charge $100 and pack stadiums of, you know, with three, 4,000 people.
[01:40:14.346 --> 01:40:15.446]  We could do it.
[01:40:15.446 --> 01:40:17.407]  And then I would raise millions and I could do it that way.
[01:40:17.407 --> 01:40:20.928]  In fact, I'm really starting to think about maybe doing that.
[01:40:23.254 --> 01:40:25.314]  But it's my instinct to give things away for free.
[01:40:25.314 --> 01:40:26.655]  I mean, remember when you donate.
[01:40:26.655 --> 01:40:28.035]  Remember when you support us.
[01:40:28.035 --> 01:40:30.015]  Remember when you buy the books and videos.
[01:40:30.015 --> 01:40:33.616]  I pioneered make copies, give them out to everybody you know, because I want to get the word out.
[01:40:33.616 --> 01:40:38.897]  You know, I've pioneered having all these other activists and people on to support their operations and what they're doing.
[01:40:38.897 --> 01:40:42.078]  We pioneered, you know, trying to do it at cost.
[01:40:42.078 --> 01:40:50.760]  I mean, it's like I was talking to the radio stations out in, you know, just south of San Francisco and Santa Cruz that carry the show.
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:52.040]  They're like, well, what do you think we should charge?
[01:40:53.001 --> 01:40:54.482]  Uh, they said, what do we need to pay you to come out here?
[01:40:54.482 --> 01:40:55.983]  And I said, well, pay me nothing.
[01:40:55.983 --> 01:41:03.687]  Uh, you know, get my plane ticket and my hotel, but I want, I want to charge something that's cost.
[01:41:03.687 --> 01:41:06.089]  And they said, how about $10 and 80 cents?
[01:41:06.089 --> 01:41:06.709]  And it sold out.
[01:41:06.709 --> 01:41:11.052]  So I, I have kind of weird ways of doing things.
[01:41:11.052 --> 01:41:13.553]  And it was listeners that started a money bomb three years ago.
[01:41:13.553 --> 01:41:15.334]  And I kind of ignored it and people like, why aren't you covering?
[01:41:15.334 --> 01:41:18.136]  And I go, well, I don't really like asking for donations, but
[01:41:19.707 --> 01:41:36.021]  The government takes my tax money, your tax money, our tax money, same thing in Europe, and gives it, not just to government broadcasting like PBS or public radio, they give it in product placement, propaganda placement, behavior placement as they call it, by the billions every month to media.
[01:41:36.021 --> 01:41:41.266]  So they're already taking your money and financing Fox News, ABC News, NBC, CBS.
[01:41:41.906 --> 01:41:48.672]  I told you this years ago that the CIA is in all those networks and it was in mainstream news this week that Army psychological warfare.
[01:41:48.672 --> 01:41:52.755]  Because it came out they were in CBS and people said, oh well they're just there being trained.
[01:41:52.755 --> 01:41:54.737]  No, it's the other way around.
[01:41:54.737 --> 01:41:58.820]  And I remember seeing articles 12 years ago about CBS broadcast center.
[01:41:58.820 --> 01:42:02.283]  It actually prepares the news for NBC, ABC,
[01:42:03.889 --> 01:42:07.051]  I mean, it's really just one group, folks.
[01:42:07.051 --> 01:42:13.556]  And one plays the part of liberal, one of the conservative, one kind of middle-of-the-road, and then they give the illusion of choice.
[01:42:13.556 --> 01:42:15.617]  So, we need to go to the next level.
[01:42:15.617 --> 01:42:22.922]  I mean, I could just sit here on my laurels, keep doing the show, making films, doing all of this, but we need to not make two films a year, we need to make four or five a year.
[01:42:22.922 --> 01:42:26.504]  We need to have the TV show every day and then one special show a week.
[01:42:26.504 --> 01:42:27.085]  We need to
[01:42:27.925 --> 01:42:36.467]  Up everything we're doing because I've reached 200 plus million people just on YouTube and Google in the last two or three years alone just on those platforms.
[01:42:36.467 --> 01:42:38.447]  Hundreds and hundreds of millions.
[01:42:38.447 --> 01:42:41.328]  I've reached hundreds of millions in radio and TV interviews.
[01:42:41.328 --> 01:42:43.588]  I've reached tens of millions on my radio show.
[01:42:43.588 --> 01:42:47.789]  It's ridiculous how effective we are, okay?
[01:42:47.789 --> 01:42:52.490]  And the system knows that and so we are supported by sponsors and by you, the listeners.
[01:42:53.689 --> 01:42:55.730]  And so, if you want to go ahead and start, I want to thank those that have donated.
[01:42:55.730 --> 01:43:02.751]  If you want to start donating, because I want to hit 100,000 before we start the Money Bomb officially and then raise the 400,000 to hit our goal of 500,000.
[01:43:02.751 --> 01:43:11.293]  So, InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com or you can simply also, and it's got the phone numbers up on the site, 888-253-3139 if you want to call and donate.
[01:43:11.293 --> 01:43:11.333]  888-253-3139.
[01:43:17.696 --> 01:43:19.218]  Or you can write to us, P.O.
[01:43:19.218 --> 01:43:20.480]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[01:43:24.821 --> 01:43:36.347]  But that special 24-hour broadcast, 25-hour, excuse me, broadcast, I'll be on the air 25 hours off and on with special guests, live guests, special never-before-seen video exclusives coming up on that day.
[01:43:36.347 --> 01:43:38.128]  Please spread the word to everyone you know.
[01:43:38.128 --> 01:43:42.070]  Grab the banners off of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com for the money bomb.
[01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:43.951]  Adapt them to your website.
[01:43:43.951 --> 01:43:44.771]  Get them out to people.
[01:43:44.771 --> 01:43:51.575]  I want to thank some of the sites I've seen that are promoting this themselves.
[01:43:52.675 --> 01:44:00.018]  I really do appreciate that because we want this to be the biggest success ever so we can up our game and gear up against the globalists.
[01:44:00.018 --> 01:44:04.640]  Okay.
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:21.466]  Before I get into the attacks on the First Amendment and then your phone calls and some economic news, you remember a month ago Nightline attacked us and they started the piece by saying, does he really believe what he's saying, implying I don't.
[01:44:22.704 --> 01:44:23.925]  It doesn't matter if I believe it or not.
[01:44:23.925 --> 01:44:24.685]  Of course I believe it.
[01:44:24.685 --> 01:44:25.426]  I know it.
[01:44:25.426 --> 01:44:26.066]  I don't believe it.
[01:44:26.066 --> 01:44:26.466]  I know it.
[01:44:26.466 --> 01:44:27.447]  I have all the proof.
[01:44:27.447 --> 01:44:28.307]  And I show it to you.
[01:44:28.307 --> 01:44:35.972]  I show you every quote, every statement, every article, every factoid, every number, where it came from.
[01:44:35.972 --> 01:44:43.036]  And then they go on to say if a nut was on the street saying they're poisoning the water, you'd basically run away from them.
[01:44:43.036 --> 01:44:46.238]  But if you've got a radio show, you get a million listeners.
[01:44:47.728 --> 01:44:51.290]  And ABC went out and did their own research and found that I have about a million listeners a day.
[01:44:51.290 --> 01:44:55.172]  I guess they went to the same places, the same aggregate systems we do to know that.
[01:44:55.172 --> 01:45:09.740]  It's more like two to three million, but the point is, it's a million that listen to the show while it's live in one way or another, and about another million and a half that listen to it the next day or so on rebroadcast, shortwave, satellite, internet streams, podcasts, things like that.
[01:45:09.740 --> 01:45:12.341]  But two and a half mil or so.
[01:45:12.341 --> 01:45:12.742]  It varies.
[01:45:15.066 --> 01:45:20.210]  Then Glenn Beck comes out and says the Fabian Socialists wanted to put things in the water to sterilize you.
[01:45:20.210 --> 01:45:33.942]  So I've been asking Beck to do that because the quotes are there, it's public, and literally the Bertrand Shaw quotes that we played three or four years ago, last year, this year, the very video clips we play here, he now played them last night.
[01:45:33.942 --> 01:45:37.626]  Now again, I don't trust him, but I gotta say, that's moving in the right direction.
[01:45:38.326 --> 01:45:40.208]  Okay, that's moving in the right direction.
[01:45:40.208 --> 01:45:49.376]  I mean, just last week I put out two videos specifically challenging him to talk about sterolins in the water, and I played the clip of where he said, I drink a bucket of fluoride!
[01:45:49.376 --> 01:45:50.778]  I like fluoride in the water!
[01:45:50.778 --> 01:45:53.220]  Well, Beck, what do you think the sterolin is?
[01:45:53.220 --> 01:45:54.361]  It's sodium fluoride.
[01:45:54.361 --> 01:45:56.563]  I mean, Beck, your people are watching right now.
[01:45:56.563 --> 01:45:58.144]  You may even be watching right now.
[01:45:58.144 --> 01:45:59.125]  We know that.
[01:45:59.125 --> 01:45:59.706]  Just search
[01:46:01.184 --> 01:46:03.927]  Sodium fluoride infertility studies.
[01:46:03.927 --> 01:46:06.089]  Sodium fluoride cancer studies.
[01:46:06.089 --> 01:46:08.592]  Sodium fluoride reduced IQ studies.
[01:46:08.592 --> 01:46:10.935]  These are mainline medical journals.
[01:46:10.935 --> 01:46:12.376]  Governments!
[01:46:12.376 --> 01:46:12.937]  Governments!
[01:46:14.241 --> 01:46:17.004]  So, people say, why do you talk about Beck so much?
[01:46:17.004 --> 01:46:19.546]  Because they literally are programming off the show.
[01:46:19.546 --> 01:46:22.669]  I could see their show and know they're doing it, but I have it from inside.
[01:46:22.669 --> 01:46:28.634]  So, please, please, Beck, you know, a year ago you said you drink buckets of fluoride.
[01:46:28.634 --> 01:46:29.635]  It was about a year ago.
[01:46:29.635 --> 01:46:30.856]  Now you're going in the right direction.
[01:46:30.856 --> 01:46:38.904]  But if you're wondering what Bertrand Russell and others in the UN called for, it was fluoride because it massively reduces fertility.
[01:46:39.713 --> 01:46:42.336]  Okay, so you've got their documents.
[01:46:42.336 --> 01:46:50.744]  Read a little bit further down when you're quoting Shaw and Russell and others, and then go further.
[01:46:50.744 --> 01:46:56.289]  Don't just read stuff from 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 years ago, or video clips.
[01:46:56.289 --> 01:46:57.871]  Beck, go all the way.
[01:46:59.318 --> 01:47:04.161]  Read the current stuff in the news today where these monsters are promoting it, okay?
[01:47:04.161 --> 01:47:09.085]  Don't just tell us about dead monsters, tell us about the real ones that are alive today stalking the countryside.
[01:47:09.085 --> 01:47:16.230]  But first, here is part of the Nightline piece, where a month ago it's Kooky on Nightline, and a month later...
[01:47:17.369 --> 01:47:19.150]  Glenn Beck is now covering it.
[01:47:19.150 --> 01:47:20.490]  This is very positive.
[01:47:20.490 --> 01:47:23.432]  And so I'm talking right to Beck, telling him, go to the next level.
[01:47:23.432 --> 01:47:24.352]  I'm holding his hand.
[01:47:24.352 --> 01:47:25.032]  Here it is, Beck.
[01:47:25.032 --> 01:47:26.553]  You obviously already know all this stuff.
[01:47:26.553 --> 01:47:27.713]  Go all the way.
[01:47:27.713 --> 01:47:30.695]  Now, I have seen now Fox saying they're talking about firing him.
[01:47:30.695 --> 01:47:32.335]  That was in the New York Times.
[01:47:32.335 --> 01:47:35.777]  Maybe he is getting good or something.
[01:47:35.777 --> 01:47:36.277]  I don't know.
[01:47:36.277 --> 01:47:40.239]  I mean, if they fire him like they did Lou Dobbs, maybe he is?
[01:47:40.239 --> 01:47:41.619]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:47:41.619 --> 01:47:42.940]  Point is, we're watching.
[01:47:42.940 --> 01:47:43.680]  And we're fair.
[01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:44.800]  We're open-minded.
[01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:45.861]  Here's that Nightline clip.
[01:47:50.615 --> 01:47:58.299]  If you were to stand on a street corner, hollering that the government is poisoning our water supply, you'd probably get little more than eye rolls and head shakes.
[01:47:58.299 --> 01:48:02.482]  But do the same thing in a radio booth, and you might just get a million listeners a day.
[01:48:02.482 --> 01:48:10.787]  Such is the case for Alex Jones, a man who trades in such sinister conspiracy theories, you have to wonder if he really believes half of what he says.
[01:48:10.787 --> 01:48:12.768]  Dan Harris went to Texas to find out.
[01:48:14.170 --> 01:48:16.070]  Are you for Hitler or against Hitler?
[01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:17.831]  Whatever they say, it's the opposite.
[01:48:17.831 --> 01:48:20.412]  They never tell the truth.
[01:48:20.412 --> 01:48:26.993]  They took a clip, are you for Hitler or against him, and cut it into something I was saying 20 minutes later.
[01:48:26.993 --> 01:48:39.996]  That's why I almost don't do media interviews, because I got interviewed by some people that seemed nice about population reduction, and now I learn it's coming out in a film that part of the film is Muslims did 9-11.
[01:48:39.996 --> 01:48:42.117]  I just can't control what media does.
[01:48:43.427 --> 01:48:45.989]  But then do you just turn them down and cowardly not do it?
[01:48:45.989 --> 01:48:48.670]  That sounds like I'm saying, is Hitler good or bad?
[01:48:48.670 --> 01:48:52.152]  When I was saying, Hitler is either good or bad.
[01:48:52.152 --> 01:48:54.894]  You can't have it both ways.
[01:48:54.894 --> 01:48:56.755]  Like, our government's either good or bad.
[01:48:56.755 --> 01:48:57.916]  No, it's clearly bad.
[01:48:57.916 --> 01:49:00.117]  But they took that out of context.
[01:49:00.117 --> 01:49:01.238]  But side issue.
[01:49:01.238 --> 01:49:05.080]  Let's go to this first clip where he's talking about Fabian Socialist.
[01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:06.901]  Here's Glenn Beck a month and a half later.
[01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:10.201]  Talking about poisoning the water.
[01:49:10.201 --> 01:49:11.381]  Here it is.
[01:49:11.381 --> 01:49:15.103]  Here's what everybody ignores from Shaw.
[01:49:15.103 --> 01:49:16.003]  This.
[01:49:16.003 --> 01:49:17.224]  Watch.
[01:49:17.224 --> 01:49:24.547]  Just put him there and say, sir or madam, now we'll be kind enough to justify your existence.
[01:49:24.547 --> 01:49:29.789]  If you can't justify your existence, if you're not pulling your weight in the social group,
[01:49:30.496 --> 01:49:43.790]  If you're not producing as much as you consume, or perhaps a little more, then, clearly, we cannot use the big organization of our society for the purpose of keeping you alive.
[01:49:43.790 --> 01:49:45.371]  Hit pause.
[01:49:45.371 --> 01:49:52.599]  That's really bad audio with the video that we've been airing for at least four years, but they have the quotes up there and he also wrote this in books.
[01:49:52.599 --> 01:49:53.239]  Mr. Schaub,
[01:49:54.338 --> 01:49:56.560]  But that's the death panels.
[01:49:56.560 --> 01:49:58.021]  That's what Bill Gates said a month ago.
[01:49:58.021 --> 01:50:02.464]  He said, if we don't give grandma care, we can hire 10 teachers without money.
[01:50:02.464 --> 01:50:05.747]  Once they get you collectivized, they play you off against each other.
[01:50:05.747 --> 01:50:07.808]  Oh, you gave money to the Democrats?
[01:50:07.808 --> 01:50:09.870]  You get to keep your GM car dealership.
[01:50:09.870 --> 01:50:10.691]  You're a Republican?
[01:50:10.691 --> 01:50:11.031]  You don't.
[01:50:12.666 --> 01:50:16.530]  Oh, we're going to use bailout money to ship GM overseas.
[01:50:16.530 --> 01:50:22.214]  It allows them to organize the economy and control the resources and then get us fighting with each other over it.
[01:50:22.214 --> 01:50:29.701]  But then Beck comes back, and we'll play it after the break, and basically tells the truth about these people.
[01:50:29.701 --> 01:50:32.704]  But they're not progressives.
[01:50:32.704 --> 01:50:33.865]  That's just some modern term.
[01:50:33.865 --> 01:50:34.946]  They're eugenicists.
[01:50:35.586 --> 01:50:43.251]  They want to collectivize you, to domesticate you, so they control you, so they can kill you, and that's what Shaw said.
[01:50:43.251 --> 01:50:46.393]  He said, poison the water supply.
[01:50:46.393 --> 01:50:47.814]  Well, that's what they're doing.
[01:50:47.814 --> 01:50:53.958]  You know, this guy said this in the 30s and 40s, and praised Mussolini and Hitler as a liberal.
[01:50:53.958 --> 01:50:55.078]  Well, they're doing it now.
[01:50:55.078 --> 01:50:55.659]  Do you understand?
[01:50:55.659 --> 01:50:56.679]  They run our planet.
[01:50:56.679 --> 01:50:57.240]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:01.072 --> 01:51:02.373]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.373 --> 01:51:07.955]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.955 --> 01:51:12.977]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.977 --> 01:51:18.019]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:18.539 --> 01:51:23.764]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.764 --> 01:51:30.891]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.891 --> 01:51:32.012]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:32.012 --> 01:51:38.378]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.698 --> 01:51:41.879]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:41.879 --> 01:51:44.100]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:44.100 --> 01:51:45.041]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:45.041 --> 01:51:45.441]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:45.441 --> 01:51:48.682]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:48.682 --> 01:51:50.403]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:00.768 --> 01:52:04.150]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:52:04.150 --> 01:52:08.051]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:52:08.051 --> 01:52:11.773]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[01:52:11.773 --> 01:52:16.695]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water.
[01:52:16.795 --> 01:52:17.115]  I think so.
[01:52:33.095 --> 01:52:38.220]  You'll receive a shower filter, a fluoride filter, or two sport Berkey bottles absolutely free.
[01:52:38.220 --> 01:52:47.988]  BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com would like to offer GCN listeners 5% off all ceramic filter systems and ship all orders over $50 free of charge.

[01:53:01.232 --> 01:53:05.578]  To ship a vehicle safely from point A to point B, which company should you choose?
[01:53:05.578 --> 01:53:06.399]  Easy!
[01:53:06.399 --> 01:53:08.121]  Stateway Auto Transport.
[01:53:08.121 --> 01:53:10.805]  Why trust Patriot-owned Stateway Auto Transport?
[01:53:10.805 --> 01:53:11.726]  Many reasons.
[01:53:11.726 --> 01:53:16.152]  Stateway is not just a broker, but a fully licensed and bonded carrier with its own fleet of
[01:53:16.212 --> 01:53:16.752]  I think so.
[01:53:33.404 --> 01:53:33.904]  That's right.
[01:54:03.720 --> 01:54:08.625]  See, this is the inverse of what libertarians or constitutionalists say.
[01:54:08.625 --> 01:54:14.970]  They say, don't have a bunch of welfare, or have it be private, and that will encourage people to be rugged individuals.
[01:54:14.970 --> 01:54:24.039]  But the socialist engineers, the eugenicists, they set up the health departments over a hundred years ago in England and the US to exterminate people.
[01:54:24.039 --> 01:54:27.302]  This is social Malthusian, social Darwinism.
[01:54:28.550 --> 01:54:40.814]  And so they collectivize things, make it to where you can't take care of yourself, and then say, we're going to kill you if you don't produce for us and if you don't justify yourself for the state.
[01:54:40.814 --> 01:54:48.437]  That was basically the video clip, quote, but it was bad audio because it was shot in the 30s, of George Shaw.
[01:54:49.807 --> 01:54:51.107]  George Bernard Shaw.
[01:54:51.107 --> 01:54:52.248]  But let me read you the quote.
[01:54:52.248 --> 01:54:59.730]  You must all know half a dozen people, at least, who are of no use in this world, of course the state will decide, who are more trouble than they are worth.
[01:54:59.730 --> 01:55:02.071]  You know, like Grandma, Bill Gates, said get rid of her.
[01:55:02.071 --> 01:55:04.131]  The case for killing Granny, cover of Newsweek.
[01:55:04.131 --> 01:55:11.574]  Just put them there and say, Madam, now you will be kind enough to justify your existence because I'm God.
[01:55:11.574 --> 01:55:12.294]  He didn't say that part.
[01:55:13.561 --> 01:55:19.286]  Just put them there and say, sir or madam, now you will be kind enough to justify your existence.
[01:55:19.286 --> 01:55:32.859]  If you can't justify your existence, if you're not pulling your weight in the social boat, if you're not producing as much as you consume, or perhaps a little more, then clearly, we cannot use the organizations of society for the purpose of keeping you alive.
[01:55:32.859 --> 01:55:37.524]  Because your life does not benefit us, and it can't be of very much use to yourself.
[01:55:38.604 --> 01:55:42.528]  If we don't give grandma end-of-life treatment, we can hire 10 teachers.
[01:55:42.528 --> 01:55:47.072]  That's exactly what Bill Gates is saying his dad, formerly on the board of Planned Parenthood.
[01:55:47.072 --> 01:55:48.854]  He is a eugenicist.
[01:55:48.854 --> 01:55:50.815]  But they say, oh Bill Gates is helping people.
[01:55:50.815 --> 01:55:53.278]  Let's finish up with this clip of Beck.
[01:55:57.335 --> 01:56:00.959]  It's not useful to you or to the society.
[01:56:00.959 --> 01:56:03.002]  The man was a monster!
[01:56:03.002 --> 01:56:08.027]  Shaw was a famous playwright, but he was also a strong believer in eugenics.
[01:56:08.027 --> 01:56:11.571]  Who dreamt up the gas chambers, the death chambers?
[01:56:11.571 --> 01:56:12.192]  Okay.
[01:56:12.192 --> 01:56:12.532]  Who did?
[01:56:12.532 --> 01:56:14.334]  I mean, look!
[01:56:14.334 --> 01:56:17.118]  You've got to praise what Beck just did, and it went on for an hour, okay?
[01:56:18.447 --> 01:56:21.588]  Now, who dreamt up staging terror?
[01:56:21.588 --> 01:56:23.149]  The eugenicist Hitler.
[01:56:23.149 --> 01:56:24.450]  You won't talk about that though, Beck.
[01:56:24.450 --> 01:56:25.930]  Let's see you do that.
[01:56:25.930 --> 01:56:26.751]  Let's see you do that.
[01:56:26.751 --> 01:56:31.173]  Let's see you get those firefighters on, the hundreds of them, that saw the bombs going off.
[01:56:31.173 --> 01:56:34.074]  Play the CNN clip where they're saying, get back, we're gonna blow up seven.
[01:56:34.074 --> 01:56:37.956]  No, you'd just rather say, we're violent 9-11 truthers and should be arrested.
[01:56:37.956 --> 01:56:40.116]  That's why I don't trust you, but you're going in the right direction.
[01:56:40.116 --> 01:56:46.459]  Now, here's this next clip about the Fabian Socialists wanting to sterilize you through the water.
[01:56:46.459 --> 01:56:47.520]  It just went on and on.
[01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:47.880]  Here it is.
[01:56:50.493 --> 01:56:52.456]  ...and being completely neglected.
[01:56:52.456 --> 01:56:56.021]  It's a cold calculation based on the greater good for society.
[01:56:56.021 --> 01:57:03.712]  It's called, look it up, please don't take any of this myself, look it up, Zeke Emanuel, White House.
[01:57:03.712 --> 01:57:05.915]  It's called the complete lives system.
[01:57:07.016 --> 01:57:11.860]  It's how George Bernard Shaw can propose lethal chambers.
[01:57:11.860 --> 01:57:16.184]  It's how this woman can advocate smothering children with pillows.
[01:57:16.184 --> 01:57:20.928]  It's how environmentalists can justify executing skeptics.
[01:57:20.928 --> 01:57:34.939]  It's how Obama's science czar, John Holdren, who believed in the wildly discredited idea of the population explosion, can propose putting sterilants in drinking water and forced sterilizations.
[01:57:35.319 --> 01:57:42.623]  And a planetary regime, i.e., global government to monitor global population size.
[01:57:42.623 --> 01:57:44.244]  It's for the greater good, you see.
[01:57:44.244 --> 01:57:45.165]  Unbelievable.
[01:57:45.165 --> 01:57:45.725]  Unbelievable.
[01:57:45.725 --> 01:57:46.526]  It's compassionate.
[01:57:46.526 --> 01:57:47.286]  Unbelievable.
[01:57:47.286 --> 01:57:54.170]  I don't know how... He's got a contract there, and they don't want to pay out his three million a year just for TV.
[01:57:54.170 --> 01:58:00.114]  But he told the New York Times, you know, that he's in rough waters with ales.
[01:58:00.114 --> 01:58:01.575]  And I understand why.
[01:58:04.246 --> 01:58:12.930]  Rupert Murdoch funds all this and goes to Davos and promotes eugenics garbage on Fox Entertainment television and movies and admit that that's their goal.
[01:58:12.930 --> 01:58:16.432]  So Beck, I mean, you literally are in the devil's workshop.
[01:58:16.432 --> 01:58:21.815]  You're telling us about some of the devil's little demons, but how about you tell us about one of the top fallen angels?
[01:58:21.815 --> 01:58:23.496]  You know, they're serving Lucifer.
[01:58:23.496 --> 01:58:24.917]  Why don't you tell us about your boss?
[01:58:25.757 --> 01:58:27.718]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:27.718 --> 01:58:29.240]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.069 --> 01:58:52.711]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.711 --> 01:58:56.074]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.
[01:58:56.074 --> 01:59:01.299]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.
[01:59:01.299 --> 01:59:04.742]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.
[01:59:04.742 --> 01:59:07.064]  Check them out on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[01:59:07.705 --> 01:59:11.248]  Or call 800-340-7091.
[01:59:11.248 --> 01:59:12.369]  Take my word for it.
[01:59:12.369 --> 01:59:15.032]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.

[01:59:53.942 --> 01:59:56.323]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.323 --> 01:59:59.165]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.652 --> 02:00:10.475]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.475 --> 02:00:12.056]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.056 --> 02:00:13.617]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.617 --> 02:00:17.820]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.820 --> 02:00:25.564]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.564 --> 02:00:29.467]  We're back live if you just joined us, if your station just tuned in to us.
[02:00:31.485 --> 02:00:36.067]  I just covered incredible, incredible clips by Glenn Beck.
[02:00:36.067 --> 02:00:50.392]  He's not just talking about people 60 years ago now, he's talking about the White House science czar, wanting to put sterilants in the water to sterilize you as part of a world government, and how this entire group wants to do this, and kill people in gas chambers.
[02:00:50.392 --> 02:01:00.116]  Those gas chamber ideas actually came from the eugenicists, people like Mr. Shaw, Bertrand Russell, the liberals.
[02:01:01.369 --> 02:01:07.456]  And people can argue all day about, you know, what Hitler was exactly doing or how he killed people, but I've got the books written by Shaw.
[02:01:07.456 --> 02:01:08.837]  We've got them back there in our library.
[02:01:08.837 --> 02:01:12.601]  We've shot video of it, put it in films years ago, showed it to you on TV.
[02:01:12.601 --> 02:01:15.444]  They talked about gas chambers.
[02:01:15.444 --> 02:01:20.069]  For some of you out there that deny Hitler had gas chambers, he certainly killed a bunch of people.
[02:01:20.069 --> 02:01:22.152]  And these people were proposing gas chambers.
[02:01:23.570 --> 02:01:32.312]  And poisoning the water, and we know that they are doing it now to everybody with soft, slow kills.
[02:01:32.312 --> 02:01:38.413]  There can be no doubt, I mean, I already know it from inside sources, but no doubt, Glenn Beck, they are watching everything we do.
[02:01:38.413 --> 02:01:39.834]  It's amazing.
[02:01:39.834 --> 02:01:49.756]  And so I have to really up what I'm doing in my research to realize that a lot of what I cover now ends up on Fox Television and on Glenn Beck's radio show, so I'm actually happy.
[02:01:50.734 --> 02:01:56.720]  Hello, good afternoon, and thank you for all that you do, and I'm going to give you $100 to your site, or your cameras, or whatever you want.
[02:02:16.607 --> 02:02:18.727]  I don't have much, but I'm going to give a hundred.
[02:02:18.727 --> 02:02:22.648]  I have a two point... Hold on, if you don't have much, I don't want you to donate.
[02:02:22.648 --> 02:02:30.350]  We've got plenty of people out there, you know, that spend thousands of dollars a week on fine wine, who are supposed patriots.
[02:02:30.350 --> 02:02:32.070]  They can give to the money bomb.
[02:02:32.070 --> 02:02:32.970]  But, sorry, go ahead.
[02:02:32.970 --> 02:02:42.152]  At this point, and I'm not sure, I've been researching the bloodlines of our presidents, and 33 of the 42 are all traced back to Charlemagne.
[02:02:43.261 --> 02:02:47.842]  Now 19 also are related to King Edward III of England.
[02:02:47.842 --> 02:02:52.223]  I've seen that at Ancestry.com and almost all presidents are related.
[02:02:52.223 --> 02:02:58.525]  And you had in 2004 Kerry and Bush who were cousins on every side.
[02:02:58.525 --> 02:03:02.986]  You know, 5th cousins, 12th cousins, I mean just every... It's like I've got a French Bulldog.
[02:03:03.366 --> 02:03:05.527]  It's related to every other French bulldog in the world.
[02:03:05.527 --> 02:03:07.187]  It's a breed of dog.
[02:03:07.187 --> 02:03:10.588]  Kerry and Bush, same fraternity, same secret society.
[02:03:10.588 --> 02:03:13.609]  Cousins on every side, every relation.
[02:03:13.609 --> 02:03:17.950]  And then they did breakdowns of their wives being related.
[02:03:17.950 --> 02:03:20.730]  I mean, it is a breed of globalists.
[02:03:20.730 --> 02:03:21.710]  Go ahead.
[02:03:21.710 --> 02:03:23.331]  Well, also, the same thing.
[02:03:23.331 --> 02:03:26.152]  Obama and Palin and Clinton... No, no.
[02:03:26.152 --> 02:03:28.112]  Obama's related to Cheney.
[02:03:28.112 --> 02:03:29.452]  He's related to Bush.
[02:03:29.452 --> 02:03:31.113]  He's related... They're all related.
[02:03:31.113 --> 02:03:31.693]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:03:32.415 --> 02:03:42.420]  It's frightening, but my other point, I'm a little stuffed up, but the other night, I live in Houston, and as you know, our summers are very hot here, and we get these new breed of mosquitoes.
[02:03:42.420 --> 02:03:49.023]  They're very tiny, and they bite, and it's a whole new mosquito I've never seen in the last couple years.
[02:03:49.023 --> 02:03:51.484]  And I get, well, like, bigger than two quarters.
[02:03:51.484 --> 02:03:52.225]  It's huge.
[02:03:52.225 --> 02:03:54.686]  And then the other night, they came spraying.
[02:03:54.686 --> 02:03:56.507]  They don't spray when mosquitoes are around.
[02:03:56.507 --> 02:03:59.268]  They spray so then we can get sick, so we can go get the flu shot.
[02:04:00.133 --> 02:04:04.459]  I went running in the house because I didn't know the truck was coming, because it never comes when you need them.
[02:04:04.459 --> 02:04:12.229]  But anyway, it's all part of that master plan is to spray them down, get them in to get the flu shot, let's get them, you know, that, it just, it never ends.
[02:04:12.873 --> 02:04:17.094]  No, I mean, everybody I know across the country is stopped up.
[02:04:17.094 --> 02:04:18.354]  They call it allergies.
[02:04:18.354 --> 02:04:20.375]  Most of the office is sick with it.
[02:04:20.375 --> 02:04:22.216]  My children have been sick with it.
[02:04:22.216 --> 02:04:26.737]  And they don't get fevers, they're just sick with sore throats and the sniffles, and I've had it as well.
[02:04:26.737 --> 02:04:28.937]  My eyes are burning right now.
[02:04:28.937 --> 02:04:34.039]  And it's just, it's just, my grandmother, you know, Texas her whole life, never had allergies.
[02:04:34.039 --> 02:04:34.739]  She has them now.
[02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:37.500]  It's amazing.
[02:04:37.500 --> 02:04:40.681]  Really good points, Roxanne, Nick, Dan, Paul, Todd, and others.
[02:04:40.681 --> 02:04:48.725]  We'll get to your calls this hour, but I've got economic news, free speech attack news that is so important coming up on the other side of this quick break.
[02:04:48.725 --> 02:04:49.805]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:04:49.805 --> 02:04:57.128]  This is the GCN Radio Network, and yes, the Money Bomb is coming up with a 25-hour marathon transmission starting next Thursday, 11 a.m.
[02:04:57.128 --> 02:04:58.249]  Central, right here.
[02:05:02.193 --> 02:05:06.217]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:05:06.217 --> 02:05:09.460]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:05:09.460 --> 02:05:14.244]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:05:14.244 --> 02:05:20.650]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:05:20.650 --> 02:05:22.893]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:05:23.393 --> 02:05:23.713]  Tim Geithner?
[02:05:23.713 --> 02:05:24.234]  Bernanke?
[02:05:24.234 --> 02:05:24.894]  They're arsonists!
[02:05:24.894 --> 02:05:26.195]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:05:26.195 --> 02:05:28.436]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:05:42.324 --> 02:05:44.447]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:05:44.447 --> 02:05:49.593]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:05:49.593 --> 02:05:58.724]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:06:03.828 --> 02:06:07.610]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[02:06:07.610 --> 02:06:10.491]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[02:06:10.491 --> 02:06:15.414]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.

[02:07:04.847 --> 02:07:06.108]  Tyranny is here.
[02:07:06.108 --> 02:07:09.969]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:07:09.969 --> 02:07:12.270]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:07:12.270 --> 02:07:18.132]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:07:18.132 --> 02:07:24.374]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:07:24.794 --> 02:07:30.739]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:07:30.739 --> 02:07:34.962]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:07:34.962 --> 02:07:39.246]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:07:39.246 --> 02:07:45.191]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:07:45.191 --> 02:07:48.754]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:07:48.754 --> 02:07:50.735]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:07:50.735 --> 02:07:51.156]  It's here.
[02:07:51.816 --> 02:08:02.501]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:02.501 --> 02:08:09.124]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.124 --> 02:08:12.126]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:14.022 --> 02:08:18.045]  All right, we're going to be getting into the economy in about five minutes.
[02:08:18.045 --> 02:08:37.979]  And I told you at the start of the broadcast that our top story, the most important thing we're facing, is in closing arguments yesterday, the majority of Supreme Court justices made statements that they are going to restrict free speech for the first time in United States history.
[02:08:39.039 --> 02:08:41.381]  They are going to restrict protest.
[02:08:41.381 --> 02:08:48.125]  They are going to restrict any speech that is seen as hurtful or that anyone is offended by.
[02:08:48.125 --> 02:08:50.147]  Now, the same thing is happening in England.
[02:08:50.147 --> 02:08:51.608]  They've just passed the law.
[02:08:51.608 --> 02:08:53.529]  I covered that last week.
[02:08:53.529 --> 02:08:59.834]  Where if someone is offended by what you say, even if it isn't about them, you can be sued and they say you're liable.
[02:08:59.834 --> 02:09:01.675]  This is how they're going to shut down free speech.
[02:09:01.675 --> 02:09:04.837]  This is one slice of it.
[02:09:04.837 --> 02:09:07.319]  And I am shaken.
[02:09:07.319 --> 02:09:08.000]  I am shaken.
[02:09:09.093 --> 02:09:13.236]  By the information that I just read during the break.
[02:09:13.236 --> 02:09:18.961]  Paul Watson, I was calling him during the break about another issue and he said, why aren't you covering my story?
[02:09:18.961 --> 02:09:21.262]  And I said, well, I hadn't seen it in the last hour.
[02:09:21.262 --> 02:09:29.669]  And when I read it, I had seen previous statements out of Cass Sunstein, the UN, the secret copyright treaty that's now public.
[02:09:29.669 --> 02:09:33.272]  The announcements by Internet2, this private government slash consortium.
[02:09:34.656 --> 02:09:35.876]  We're good to go.
[02:09:59.145 --> 02:10:01.307]  They set, it's a continuity of agenda.
[02:10:01.307 --> 02:10:02.428]  This is so huge.
[02:10:02.428 --> 02:10:04.170]  I mean, I'm almost shaking over this.
[02:10:04.170 --> 02:10:05.991]  They're really doing this.
[02:10:05.991 --> 02:10:14.059]  And they launched the last worm last week and then announced that they want to take over the web to keep you safe from it when they admittedly launched it.
[02:10:14.059 --> 02:10:21.745]  There is a cocktail of attacks, kind of like a Tinker Toy set or Legos, where the pieces together
[02:10:22.711 --> 02:10:23.812]  You can't tell what they are.
[02:10:23.812 --> 02:10:27.455]  When it goes together, you see it, and they admit that that's what they're doing.
[02:10:27.455 --> 02:10:29.457]  Now, now, hold on to yourselves here.
[02:10:29.457 --> 02:10:31.559]  Hold on to your hat.
[02:10:31.559 --> 02:10:41.748]  First Amendment ruling destined to kill internet-free speech because the justices went on to say, this will shut down saying mean things on the web.
[02:10:42.853 --> 02:10:46.856]  About government, individuals, you name it.
[02:10:46.856 --> 02:10:48.817]  This will open the door for federal laws, state laws.
[02:10:48.817 --> 02:10:55.802]  They couldn't pass Cyber Bullying Act, where it said if you hurt someone's feelings, you get hardcore hate crime jail time.
[02:10:55.802 --> 02:10:56.903]  They couldn't get that through.
[02:10:56.903 --> 02:11:00.085]  So they're legislating from the bench.
[02:11:00.085 --> 02:11:03.927]  Exactly what happened in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.
[02:11:03.927 --> 02:11:09.331]  Sometimes Hitler couldn't even get the Reichstag when he first got into office to do things, so he'd just have the courts do it.
[02:11:11.058 --> 02:11:13.160]  Or you just have private security thugs come beat you up.
[02:11:13.160 --> 02:11:14.100]  Same thing.
[02:11:14.100 --> 02:11:15.141]  We've been through this before.
[02:11:15.141 --> 02:11:19.324]  So here's Kurt Nimmo's article, First Amendment ruling destined to kill internet-free speech.
[02:11:19.324 --> 02:11:31.693]  And it quotes the LA Times and quotes the Supreme Court justices in the case of these people going to funerals and screaming, you know, your son deserved to die, God loves that they're dead, dragging the American flag behind him.
[02:11:31.693 --> 02:11:33.575]  It looks like it's staged to me.
[02:11:33.575 --> 02:11:34.916]  I mean, I've seen the people on TV.
[02:11:34.916 --> 02:11:36.357]  It looks cartoonish.
[02:11:36.357 --> 02:11:40.060]  And now you can really see that they take something distasteful,
[02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:44.794]  Most people don't like and they say, okay, well now you have no free speech.
[02:11:44.794 --> 02:11:45.015]  Okay?
[02:11:46.567 --> 02:11:50.530]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is so horrible and so dangerous.
[02:11:50.530 --> 02:11:53.692]  And the FCC is announcing they want to censor the internet.
[02:11:53.692 --> 02:11:55.873]  They're announcing they want to control what you can say.
[02:11:55.873 --> 02:12:05.339]  They want to set up literal Soviets, Soviet means committees, in your towns that are, quote, private, quasi-governmental, that then report to the government.
[02:12:05.339 --> 02:12:10.042]  And if they complain, your radio show, your website, your film is over.
[02:12:10.042 --> 02:12:14.325]  The Supreme Court already tried this year to ban a film about Hillary Clinton.
[02:12:15.759 --> 02:12:17.781]  I mean, this is going on.
[02:12:17.781 --> 02:12:18.822]  So here's that article.
[02:12:18.822 --> 02:12:19.943]  Please get it out to everyone.
[02:12:19.943 --> 02:12:22.585]  First Amendment ruling destined to kill internet free speech.
[02:12:22.585 --> 02:12:25.848]  And I need Paul Watson tomorrow to do a master article.
[02:12:25.848 --> 02:12:26.949]  He's done this before.
[02:12:26.949 --> 02:12:35.357]  By master, it's like a master key that covers the 10, 15 or more key ways they're killing free speech globally.
[02:12:35.357 --> 02:12:36.238]  And it's the same thing.
[02:12:36.238 --> 02:12:37.719]  It's continuity of agenda.
[02:12:37.719 --> 02:12:39.321]  It's the same implementation everywhere.
[02:12:40.270 --> 02:12:52.755]  First Amendment ruling destined to kill internet free speech, and the Supreme Court is saying that, quote, the justice appeared to incline to set a limit on free speech when ordinary citizens are targeted with especially personal or hurtful attacks.
[02:12:52.755 --> 02:13:02.558]  The First Amendment says the government may restrict free speech, and it goes on here to have one justice say this will affect the internet.
[02:13:02.558 --> 02:13:04.159]  Okay, so it's got all the quotes right there.
[02:13:06.357 --> 02:13:09.299]  We've also have the other articles that we wrote about it.
[02:13:09.299 --> 02:13:12.842]  Justices signal intent to dismantle First Amendment.
[02:13:12.842 --> 02:13:13.562]  Okay?
[02:13:13.562 --> 02:13:19.907]  Now, that dovetails with Obama administration pressures ISPs to censor websites.
[02:13:19.907 --> 02:13:21.328]  What did Lieberman say last year?
[02:13:21.328 --> 02:13:25.111]  He said that he wants his office to be able to tell YouTube what to take down.
[02:13:25.111 --> 02:13:27.373]  No judge, no jury, he's God.
[02:13:27.373 --> 02:13:29.915]  Well, now because they couldn't get cybersecurity through yet,
[02:13:30.919 --> 02:13:39.763]  They have officially asked them to give them a list of sites, terms, names, anything the government asks for them to shut down for ISPs to shut down.
[02:13:39.763 --> 02:13:42.704]  I mean, this is just lawless, brazen mafia.
[02:13:42.704 --> 02:13:47.726]  Now, what's the new news that is so off the charts, so incredible?
[02:13:47.726 --> 02:13:52.848]  And I'd seen previous quotes by the UN, Cass Sunstein, and Microsoft people.
[02:13:54.405 --> 02:14:01.979]  On this subject, and it's going up on Infowars.com right now, and I've read over what Microsoft has said.
[02:14:01.979 --> 02:14:06.027]  I'm going to have the Infowars headline changed a bit because it's worse than what Watson even said.
[02:14:07.819 --> 02:14:11.980]  Microsoft proposal opens door for government licensing to access internet.
[02:14:11.980 --> 02:14:16.942]  Well, no, that's one of the cornerstones of this internet takeover.
[02:14:16.942 --> 02:14:20.823]  And on the site, they have the video of Microsoft admitting it.
[02:14:20.823 --> 02:14:23.564]  And again, Microsoft is basically a Pentagon front.
[02:14:23.564 --> 02:14:30.306]  But our headline needs to be, Microsoft proposes government licensing to access internet.
[02:14:30.306 --> 02:14:31.466]  And you know what I'm gonna do.
[02:14:31.466 --> 02:14:34.067]  We did it again yesterday, AOL News,
[02:14:34.887 --> 02:14:41.791]  Countless other news, online publications, hundreds reported on huge explosion.
[02:14:41.791 --> 02:14:43.252]  And it's now everywhere.
[02:14:43.252 --> 02:14:47.015]  People seeing the firefighter testimonies about bombs in the buildings going off.
[02:14:47.015 --> 02:14:48.616]  This is huge.
[02:14:49.850 --> 02:14:53.473]  So I want you to because I mean we've got time is limited.
[02:14:53.473 --> 02:15:00.779]  We've got to use this search ability every time because you are successfully getting it done by putting it into the Google search engine over and over again.
[02:15:00.779 --> 02:15:02.021]  People will learn about this.
[02:15:02.021 --> 02:15:04.483]  The Drudge Report will probably link to it.
[02:15:04.483 --> 02:15:06.304]  Everybody send this to the Drudge Report folks.
[02:15:06.304 --> 02:15:11.309]  Microsoft proposal opens door for government licensing to access
[02:15:12.532 --> 02:15:15.154]  Internet, and then it's got all the quotes, all the documents.
[02:15:15.154 --> 02:15:18.316]  This is what we wrote about six, seven years ago dealing with Internet, too.
[02:15:18.316 --> 02:15:19.397]  We've had their blueprint.
[02:15:19.397 --> 02:15:20.617]  It's now happening.
[02:15:20.617 --> 02:15:25.160]  And the headlines, Obama, you know, will have Killswitch, the shutdown web.
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:26.121]  Last week, L.A.
[02:15:26.121 --> 02:15:30.004]  Times, former head of the CIA, we need to be able to shut down the web.
[02:15:30.004 --> 02:15:34.727]  Do you think when they set off a nuke and blame it on al Qaeda to take our freedoms that they're going to let us be on air?
[02:15:35.799 --> 02:15:42.587]  You better be downloading the show, saving the website, making discs, to hand them out, to put up flyers on street corners.
[02:15:42.587 --> 02:15:47.853]  If they ever start really shutting the web down, which is starting to happen, you've got to intensify the on-the-ground.
[02:15:47.853 --> 02:15:52.918]  Because as they shut down free speech, people are going to seek out alternative information even more.
[02:15:53.599 --> 02:15:54.500]  Okay?
[02:15:54.500 --> 02:15:57.864]  So, here's the InfoWars.com headline on the same story.
[02:15:57.864 --> 02:15:59.365]  Get this out to everyone.
[02:15:59.365 --> 02:16:03.009]  Microsoft proposes government licensing internet access.
[02:16:03.009 --> 02:16:06.953]  Microsoft proposes government licensing internet access.
[02:16:06.953 --> 02:16:08.054]  And the search term will be...
[02:16:09.315 --> 02:16:12.976]  Government Licensing Internet.
[02:16:12.976 --> 02:16:20.458]  That's a long words, but just type it into Google, and then sit there and hit enter over and over again, re-entering it in the search box.
[02:16:20.458 --> 02:16:32.162]  All you gotta do is put your cursor in the middle, hit enter again so that it sees it as a new search, and just enter it in there a good hundred times or so, do it on Yahoo, but also take this article, send it to all radio talk show hosts in your area.
[02:16:32.162 --> 02:16:34.783]  We can get grassroots media that isn't totally controlled to cover this.
[02:16:35.703 --> 02:16:44.509]  But we need a master article, maybe even today by Watson, that just boils down all the different ways, the way, you know, how the globalists are killing the Internet.
[02:16:44.509 --> 02:16:46.670]  The Internet is being murdered now.
[02:16:46.670 --> 02:16:49.292]  This is an ongoing crime in action.
[02:16:49.292 --> 02:16:50.713]  They are now coming out in the open.
[02:16:50.713 --> 02:16:51.353]  They're moving.
[02:16:51.353 --> 02:16:52.094]  It's happening now.
[02:16:53.120 --> 02:16:55.482]  Government licensing internet.
[02:16:55.482 --> 02:16:57.464]  Government licensing internet.
[02:16:57.464 --> 02:16:58.345]  Your name.
[02:16:58.345 --> 02:17:00.347]  Tracking everything you do.
[02:17:00.347 --> 02:17:02.589]  That's what cybersecurity does.
[02:17:02.589 --> 02:17:07.073]  It puts software on all new computers and through ISPs to watch everywhere you go.
[02:17:08.442 --> 02:17:10.744]  And to block what you can get.
[02:17:10.744 --> 02:17:13.566]  It surveils and restricts.
[02:17:13.566 --> 02:17:19.131]  You already see Google lying about sites saying it's got a virus on it to try to shut them down.
[02:17:19.131 --> 02:17:20.632]  They tried that with the Drudge Report.
[02:17:20.632 --> 02:17:22.293]  They tried to claim it had a virus on it.
[02:17:22.293 --> 02:17:23.874]  The Democrats put out a press release.
[02:17:23.874 --> 02:17:25.216]  It wasn't true.
[02:17:25.216 --> 02:17:27.457]  So you can see how they're going to do this.
[02:17:27.457 --> 02:17:29.019]  You're not going to get the Drudge Report.
[02:17:29.019 --> 02:17:30.900]  You're not going to get InfoWars.com.
[02:17:30.900 --> 02:17:32.882]  You're not going to get PrisonPlanet.com under this.
[02:17:34.062 --> 02:17:37.123]  Government proposes government licensing internet access.
[02:17:37.123 --> 02:17:40.544]  Microsoft proposes government licensing internet access.
[02:17:40.544 --> 02:17:42.065]  And the governments are proposing it as well.
[02:17:42.065 --> 02:17:45.966]  So the search term is three words, government licensing internet.
[02:17:45.966 --> 02:17:49.868]  Search those, put those three words in, back to back, you know, with a space in them.
[02:17:49.868 --> 02:17:54.329]  Three words together, that's the search term, government licensing internet.
[02:17:54.329 --> 02:17:56.150]  Government licensing internet.
[02:17:57.427 --> 02:18:02.769]  And I'm going to talk about this with Andrew Napolitano and the Federal Reserve and a host of other issues when he joins us.
[02:18:02.769 --> 02:18:14.853]  A new proposal by a top Microsoft executive would open the door for government licensing to access the Internet, with authorities being empowered to block individual computers from connecting to the World Wide Web under the pretext of preventing malware attacks.
[02:18:14.853 --> 02:18:21.535]  And they're also saying if you ever download something that a company says, with no proof, might be copyright, your site is gone.
[02:18:21.535 --> 02:18:23.136]  Or your Internet access is gone.
[02:18:23.136 --> 02:18:24.236]  France is already doing that.
[02:18:24.836 --> 02:18:26.316]  I mean, this is happening, okay?
[02:18:26.316 --> 02:18:28.157]  This is happening!
[02:18:28.157 --> 02:18:36.599]  Last year, they tried to put tens of thousands of websites on a banned list in Australia, and Australia said, the government, this is Chinese-style censorship.
[02:18:36.599 --> 02:18:38.300]  They said, it's good, we're doing it.
[02:18:38.300 --> 02:18:41.641]  But that got beaten back narrowly, but they're back again.
[02:18:41.641 --> 02:18:44.822]  Look, this can and will and is happening.
[02:18:46.052 --> 02:18:47.013]  Go read this article.
[02:18:47.013 --> 02:18:49.437]  This is only one way they're calling for this.
[02:18:49.437 --> 02:18:56.226]  And I hope Watson adds to the article about how they tried to claim the Drudge Report had this virus and it wasn't true.
[02:18:56.226 --> 02:18:59.891]  And the Democrats put out that, you know, memorandum, don't go to the Drudge Report because it'll give you a virus.
[02:18:59.891 --> 02:19:00.452]  Total lie.
[02:19:02.588 --> 02:19:03.849]  This is what they're doing.
[02:19:03.849 --> 02:19:05.329]  This is how they're operating.
[02:19:05.329 --> 02:19:06.950]  This is serious.
[02:19:06.950 --> 02:19:08.551]  They staged the attack.
[02:19:08.551 --> 02:19:10.232]  They staged the crisis.
[02:19:10.232 --> 02:19:13.494]  Or they claim they're fighting a crisis that doesn't exist.
[02:19:13.494 --> 02:19:17.976]  So the search term is government licensing internet.
[02:19:17.976 --> 02:19:21.198]  And then, if you make this number one, which you've done in almost every case.
[02:19:21.198 --> 02:19:22.338]  You've done this 30-something times.
[02:19:22.338 --> 02:19:24.820]  Twice it didn't become number one.
[02:19:24.820 --> 02:19:26.360]  Government licensing internet.
[02:19:26.360 --> 02:19:29.122]  If you do this, we can really get this out front.
[02:19:30.131 --> 02:19:33.993]  And we are reaching so many people through these, so many new people.
[02:19:33.993 --> 02:19:36.634]  All right, I'm going to come back.
[02:19:36.634 --> 02:19:39.975]  Andrew Napolitano is coming up.
[02:19:39.975 --> 02:19:42.116]  And you got the Supreme Court saying they're going after free speech.
[02:19:42.116 --> 02:19:42.776]  I just covered that.
[02:19:42.776 --> 02:19:44.517]  I mean, do you see what's happening here?
[02:19:44.517 --> 02:19:52.701]  But I want to get in to the economy and all of the huge developments on that front right after this quick break.
[02:19:52.701 --> 02:19:53.141]  Stay with us.
[02:20:02.765 --> 02:20:04.767]  Remain in your houses.
[02:20:04.767 --> 02:20:10.551]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[02:20:10.551 --> 02:20:11.912]  Will they do it?
[02:20:11.912 --> 02:20:14.514]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[02:20:14.514 --> 02:20:20.979]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[02:20:20.979 --> 02:20:23.181]  Think it can't happen here?
[02:20:23.181 --> 02:20:25.222]  Executive Order 10990 locks down all highways.
[02:20:27.444 --> 02:20:32.325]  Executive Order 10995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[02:20:32.325 --> 02:20:37.226]  Executive Order 10998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[02:20:37.226 --> 02:20:42.968]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[02:20:42.968 --> 02:20:51.390]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America or have questions about how to survive it, go to martiallawsurvival.com.
[02:20:51.390 --> 02:20:53.890]  That's martiallawsurvival.com.
[02:20:53.890 --> 02:20:56.651]  Go to martiallawsurvival.com right now.
[02:20:56.971 --> 02:21:00.914]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[02:21:00.914 --> 02:21:03.235]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:21:03.235 --> 02:21:05.497]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:21:05.497 --> 02:21:08.819]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:21:08.819 --> 02:21:13.922]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:21:13.922 --> 02:21:18.125]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:21:18.425 --> 02:21:20.786]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:21:20.786 --> 02:21:23.667]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:21:23.667 --> 02:21:26.569]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:21:26.569 --> 02:21:34.172]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:21:34.525 --> 02:21:39.906]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:21:39.906 --> 02:21:42.747]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:21:42.747 --> 02:21:46.447]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:21:46.447 --> 02:21:47.508]  And I got news for you.
[02:21:47.508 --> 02:21:48.848]  You're everyone else.
[02:21:48.848 --> 02:21:50.348]  Invisible Empire.

[02:23:01.687 --> 02:23:03.431]  What is a wind generator?
[02:23:03.431 --> 02:23:05.835]  How can the wind produce power for a small cabin?
[02:23:05.835 --> 02:23:09.202]  How can wind energy be stored and used during an emergency?
[02:23:09.202 --> 02:23:11.146]  Can I assemble my own wind generator?

[02:23:53.526 --> 02:23:53.706]  That's 800-976-0026.
[02:24:11.949 --> 02:24:14.411]  Okay, it's official.
[02:24:14.411 --> 02:24:16.874]  The Federal Reserve is now the second largest holder of U.S.
[02:24:16.874 --> 02:24:18.255]  Treasury bonds.
[02:24:18.255 --> 02:24:25.422]  Not only does the Federal Reserve get most of this money that we pay in taxes, then we owe them debt to give them our money.
[02:24:25.422 --> 02:24:26.723]  That's a good deal if you can make it up.
[02:24:26.723 --> 02:24:28.765]  If you can write your own deal, that's what you do if you're a crook.
[02:24:29.406 --> 02:24:50.365]  The swindlers, they're setting up a world government, they're financing the movement to make us pay carbon taxes and global VAT taxes, they're announcing a world government, and now China, who they've set up in power, is the number one owner of our debt, and the United States' number two owner is the private Federal Reserve.
[02:24:51.650 --> 02:24:54.514]  Today's POMO is over.
[02:24:54.514 --> 02:25:02.784]  At $2.069 billion, the operation was right in line with our expectations, coming into a total of $12.16 submitted to acceptance ratios.
[02:25:02.784 --> 02:25:06.869]  Investors apparently are not too crazy about the yield perspective of the U.S.
[02:25:06.869 --> 02:25:07.930]  Treasuries.
[02:25:07.930 --> 02:25:10.833]  However, what is far more important is that withholdings of
[02:25:12.706 --> 02:25:15.309]  821.1 billion.
[02:25:15.309 --> 02:25:17.552]  821.1 billion.
[02:25:17.552 --> 02:25:19.113]  821 plus billion.
[02:25:19.113 --> 02:25:22.057]  The Fed is now officially the second largest holder of U.S.
[02:25:22.057 --> 02:25:25.621]  Treasuries next to China.
[02:25:25.621 --> 02:25:28.985]  I mean, you talk about being dominated by these criminals.
[02:25:28.985 --> 02:25:31.529]  You tell the general public, the Federal Reserve owns our debt.
[02:25:32.671 --> 02:25:34.952]  They don't understand what this means.
[02:25:34.952 --> 02:25:36.373]  Meanwhile, the world does.
[02:25:36.373 --> 02:25:40.775]  Dollar tumbles to fresh 15-year low against Yen, French news agency.
[02:25:40.775 --> 02:25:46.357]  Precious gold hits record of 1,360-plus.
[02:25:46.357 --> 02:25:49.459]  Food stamp recipients to 41.8 million Americans.
[02:25:49.459 --> 02:25:50.519]  Bernanke tells the truth.
[02:25:50.519 --> 02:25:53.300]  United States is now on the brink of financial disaster.
[02:25:53.300 --> 02:25:57.182]  JPMorgan thugs break into homes not in foreclosure and steals them.
[02:25:57.182 --> 02:25:59.383]  That's mainstream news.
[02:25:59.383 --> 02:26:00.604]  Standard of living plunging.
[02:26:02.819 --> 02:26:04.060]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:26:04.060 --> 02:26:08.121]  23 million Americans face massive tax hikes.
[02:26:08.121 --> 02:26:09.862]  Ted Anderson, this is insane.
[02:26:09.862 --> 02:26:15.904]  What does it mean in your research to have the private Federal Reserve being the second biggest owner of our debt?
[02:26:15.904 --> 02:26:21.126]  First China, our supposed big enemy, and now, so Communist China.
[02:26:21.126 --> 02:26:23.147]  Boy, Wall Street's fighting commies, aren't they?
[02:26:24.321 --> 02:26:29.725]  Well, you know, the funny thing is that you're talking about the Fed being the second largest institution that owns U.S.
[02:26:29.725 --> 02:26:47.476]  government debt, and they get to... Actually, the United States government prints the money, but the United States government can't use it until they put it on a semi-truck, haul it over to the Federal Reserve Bank so they can put a stamp on it to make it okay, and then they lend it back to the United States government by buying U.S.
[02:26:47.476 --> 02:26:48.477]  Treasury bonds.
[02:26:48.477 --> 02:26:50.238]  You can't get a better deal than that, Alex!
[02:26:50.718 --> 02:26:55.599]  I mean, I hear these people every now and then calling it and saying, no, you shouldn't be getting into gold and silver.
[02:26:55.599 --> 02:26:56.699]  The Fed owns it.
[02:26:56.699 --> 02:26:57.800]  You know what?
[02:26:57.800 --> 02:27:03.221]  The Federal Reserve System wants you to stay in their fiat money because they get to have it for nothing.
[02:27:03.221 --> 02:27:05.442]  And then they lend it to you, collect interest on it.
[02:27:05.442 --> 02:27:07.942]  That's why you're paying taxes in the first place.
[02:27:07.942 --> 02:27:12.683]  If it wasn't for the Fed in 1913, we wouldn't have the federal income tax in 1913.
[02:27:12.683 --> 02:27:14.044]  They went hand in hand.
[02:27:15.544 --> 02:27:19.625]  I mean, I just wish people could wake up here in the United States, snap out of it.
[02:27:19.625 --> 02:27:37.929]  Man, I tell you, it is so much more better, at least in my opinion, to own gold or put my wealth into gold than it is to have it stored in this Federal Reserve note that they have, this printing press that's attached to it, and they get to devaluate it any time they change their policy or choose to do so.
[02:27:39.129 --> 02:27:46.658]  Absolutely insanity when I hear that happen every now and then where somebody will say, well, we can't own gold because the central banks own gold.
[02:27:46.658 --> 02:27:48.240]  Well, let me tell you something.
[02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:55.748]  If you store your wealth in the fiat money that they're giving you, you're taking this printed thing that they lend you, now you're paying interest back.
[02:27:56.309 --> 02:28:00.454]  Look, that's a government disinfo, COINTELPRO op.
[02:28:00.454 --> 02:28:03.057]  Most of those people that say that ignorantly aren't operatives.
[02:28:03.057 --> 02:28:05.260]  They're just useful idiots, as Lenin would say.
[02:28:05.260 --> 02:28:07.603]  But Ted, I've never heard you this angry.
[02:28:07.603 --> 02:28:09.566]  Because we've been right about everything.
[02:28:09.566 --> 02:28:10.667]  They're doing it by design.
[02:28:11.528 --> 02:28:16.169]  They have effectively destroyed the country, and they own the nation through fraud.
[02:28:16.169 --> 02:28:20.930]  They've literally got us by the hair on this one.
[02:28:20.930 --> 02:28:24.871]  And gold ran up to an all-time high of $1,360 plus.
[02:28:24.871 --> 02:28:30.492]  They're manipulating it down $11 right now, but it's still, that was all-time highs a week ago.
[02:28:30.492 --> 02:28:33.733]  And you've still got gold you bought two, three weeks ago at the lower price.
[02:28:33.733 --> 02:28:38.694]  People need to get into gold and silver right now, or, in my opinion, they're completely insane.
[02:28:38.694 --> 02:28:40.534]  Tell us about today's offer briefly, Ted.
[02:28:40.774 --> 02:28:49.763]  Well just real quick, silver went to $23.48 and I'm offering a creature from Jekyll Island with a silver dollar for $26.45.
[02:28:49.763 --> 02:28:57.671]  That was the price I offered it for 15 years ago when I started this push to get these books in people's hands.
[02:28:57.671 --> 02:28:58.752]  Right now the best deal...
[02:28:59.232 --> 02:29:03.914]  Far beyond anything is the Silver Walking Liberty Half at $10.83.
[02:29:03.914 --> 02:29:07.595]  I mean, pick up the frame for us for $2.89.
[02:29:07.595 --> 02:29:10.856]  We get you a full year's subscription to the International Forecaster.
[02:29:10.856 --> 02:29:13.177]  That's $159 right there.
[02:29:13.177 --> 02:29:15.097]  I mean, these things I'm losing money on.
[02:29:15.097 --> 02:29:16.618]  I do have the U.S.
[02:29:16.618 --> 02:29:16.878]  Eagle.
[02:29:16.878 --> 02:29:18.299]  We have a few of the Buffalos.
[02:29:18.299 --> 02:29:22.200]  Can't buy a lot of them, but you can buy them once or twosies if you want them.
[02:29:22.980 --> 02:29:24.842]  We have the bars of gold.
[02:29:24.842 --> 02:29:26.643]  I mean, all you have to do is call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:29:26.643 --> 02:29:31.787]  Get the CBO document while you're there, too.
[02:29:31.787 --> 02:29:37.211]  See what the government's writing about this economy.
[02:29:37.211 --> 02:29:37.852]  800-686-2237.
[02:29:37.852 --> 02:29:40.934]  800-686-2237.
[02:29:40.934 --> 02:29:45.738]  Ladies and gentlemen, I mean, the Federal Reserve owns this country through fraud.
[02:29:45.738 --> 02:29:47.079]  Protect yourself from them with gold.
[02:29:47.079 --> 02:29:47.139]  800-686-2237.
[02:29:47.139 --> 02:29:47.339]  Thanks, Ted.
[02:29:51.468 --> 02:29:55.399]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.399 --> 02:29:58.086]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.109 --> 02:30:05.292]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:30:05.292 --> 02:30:11.697]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:30:11.697 --> 02:30:19.083]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:30:19.083 --> 02:30:23.967]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[02:30:23.967 --> 02:30:26.109]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:30:28.911 --> 02:30:32.619]  Or see them online at FiveStarSoap.com or InfoWars.com.
[02:30:32.619 --> 02:30:36.346]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[02:30:36.880 --> 02:30:43.647]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:30:43.647 --> 02:30:47.530]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:30:47.530 --> 02:30:54.517]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[02:30:54.517 --> 02:30:55.118]  Thank you.
[02:31:01.718 --> 02:31:17.184]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:31:17.184 --> 02:31:20.865]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:21.877 --> 02:31:34.649]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:31:34.649 --> 02:31:41.916]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:31:42.597 --> 02:31:52.969]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:31:52.969 --> 02:31:56.894]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[02:31:56.894 --> 02:32:00.017]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[02:32:00.638 --> 02:32:05.182]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:05.182 --> 02:32:06.102]  Number 1.
[02:32:06.102 --> 02:32:09.525]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:09.525 --> 02:32:10.386]  Number 2.
[02:32:10.386 --> 02:32:15.270]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:15.270 --> 02:32:16.030]  It's true.
[02:32:16.030 --> 02:32:20.894]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:20.894 --> 02:32:21.715]  Number 3.
[02:32:21.715 --> 02:32:25.298]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:25.298 --> 02:32:29.001]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:29.201 --> 02:32:30.002]  Number 4.
[02:32:30.002 --> 02:32:32.766]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:32.766 --> 02:32:36.450]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:36.450 --> 02:32:37.231]  Number 5.
[02:32:37.231 --> 02:32:41.377]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:41.377 --> 02:32:46.143]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:46.423 --> 02:32:50.607]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:50.607 --> 02:32:52.389]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:52.389 --> 02:32:54.631]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:32:54.631 --> 02:32:56.973]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:33:16.943 --> 02:33:29.406]  We are back live, and for the rest of this hour, Judge Andrew Napolitano, former state judge, number one show now on Fox Business, going to daily and weekdays.
[02:33:29.406 --> 02:33:30.747]  It's so successful.
[02:33:30.747 --> 02:33:33.788]  Just out of nowhere, he comes on, boom, number one.
[02:33:33.788 --> 02:33:41.330]  I'll guarantee you, if they put him on main Fox, he would beat everybody on that network, even if they put him at 10 o'clock at night.
[02:33:41.330 --> 02:33:45.191]  And that's what I told him, you know, six, eight months ago when I knew he was getting his weekend show.
[02:33:45.791 --> 02:33:51.214]  I said, I said, you watch, it's going to have, you know, massive ratings and you were like, I just hope to do OK.
[02:33:51.214 --> 02:33:54.175]  And you remember on air and off air, Judge, I told you.
[02:33:54.175 --> 02:33:56.496]  You did, Alex.
[02:33:56.496 --> 02:33:57.417]  And you were right.
[02:33:57.417 --> 02:34:02.659]  And I have been surprised and delighted at the generosity of viewers.
[02:34:02.659 --> 02:34:04.340]  We've been doing very, very well.
[02:34:04.340 --> 02:34:06.301]  And management decided to take us daily.
[02:34:06.301 --> 02:34:08.842]  And we expect that that will happen before Thanksgiving.
[02:34:09.696 --> 02:34:11.838]  Daily on Fox Business.
[02:34:11.838 --> 02:34:12.699]  On Fox Business.
[02:34:12.699 --> 02:34:14.541]  We will continue the show on weekends.
[02:34:14.541 --> 02:34:21.627]  Basically, we will take one of the five dailies and run it as the weekend show, but our prime work will be prime time.
[02:34:21.627 --> 02:34:23.709]  I don't know the time.
[02:34:23.709 --> 02:34:32.338]  It'll be prime time on the Fox Business Network with the full support of the Business Network and many, many cross-promotions on the Fox News Channel.
[02:34:32.338 --> 02:34:33.619]  On my continued appearances
[02:34:34.159 --> 02:34:40.545]  On the Fox News Channel and my continued fill-ins for Glenn Beck which I'm doing as soon as next Tuesday.
[02:34:41.064 --> 02:34:45.948]  Are you influencing Glenn because he is getting more and more hardcore?
[02:34:45.948 --> 02:34:48.310]  Last night we played a clip earlier in the show.
[02:34:48.310 --> 02:34:52.093]  He talked about the Fabian Socialists wanting to poison the water supply.
[02:34:52.093 --> 02:34:55.196]  I don't want to take credit for influencing him.
[02:34:55.196 --> 02:34:56.057]  I will tell you this.
[02:34:56.057 --> 02:34:57.578]  We spend a lot of time together.
[02:34:57.578 --> 02:35:00.521]  We do a lot of speaking gigs together.
[02:35:00.521 --> 02:35:02.882]  When you travel with Glenn, you travel first class.
[02:35:02.882 --> 02:35:05.425]  So we're in a small private jet and we do a lot of talking.
[02:35:06.085 --> 02:35:09.927]  He has told me that I have changed his mind on two issues.
[02:35:09.927 --> 02:35:17.412]  One is the Patriot Act, and the other is the morality, lawfulness, and constitutionality, or lack thereof, of torture.
[02:35:17.412 --> 02:35:20.754]  So I will only take credit for those two areas, which are profound.
[02:35:22.514 --> 02:35:33.556]  I did not hear what he said about the Fabian Socialists, and I didn't hear what he said about poisoning the water supply until you told me, because I was on another show last night when he said that.
[02:35:33.556 --> 02:35:35.757]  But I'm not surprised that he said it.
[02:35:35.757 --> 02:35:38.777]  I'm happy that he's issuing those warnings.
[02:35:38.777 --> 02:35:41.038]  And Alex, those warnings are resonating with people.
[02:35:41.038 --> 02:35:42.698]  You've been saying this for years now.
[02:35:42.698 --> 02:35:44.659]  He's saying it between the two of you.
[02:35:44.659 --> 02:35:46.979]  That is a monstrous audience hearing these things.
[02:35:47.159 --> 02:35:59.964]  Well, every day, for two years, I have shown the quotes from Ecoscience, where Holdren said, reduce population, a planetary tyranny to do it, force sterilization through the water.
[02:35:59.964 --> 02:36:03.446]  Beck quoted Ecoscience word for word last night.
[02:36:03.446 --> 02:36:06.747]  He played George Bernard Shaw.
[02:36:06.747 --> 02:36:13.650]  I mean, literally, it's, you know, I've been critical of Beck on torture and the police state and things he supported, but I mean,
[02:36:14.810 --> 02:36:16.912]  I know it shows one thing.
[02:36:16.912 --> 02:36:36.412]  The mood of the country has changed if Judge Andrew Napolitano has the number one show on Fox Business and is getting a primetime show weekdays and Glenn Beck is now able to go on the air and talk about things that 15 years ago I was called a lunatic for when all I was doing was reading their own statements.
[02:36:37.301 --> 02:36:45.125]  Well, you have to add to that the, and I'm not just blowing smoke at you, you have to add to that the phenomenal success of your own show.
[02:36:45.125 --> 02:36:46.686]  People have awakened.
[02:36:46.686 --> 02:36:54.770]  When people ask me about the Tea Parties, I take them back to my youth, this is before you were born, when Barry Goldwater ran against LBJ.
[02:36:55.470 --> 02:37:10.755]  That is the last time I can, and I was 13 years old, that's the last time I can remember as serious and as profound a debate about the Constitution and the role of the federal government in the lives of individuals in the past.
[02:37:12.259 --> 02:37:23.443]  And Goldwater came out and quoted the Trilateral Commission's plan to set up world government, how the banks would bankrupt us, and now, here we are, 40-something years later, it was like Barry Goldwater was a prophet.
[02:37:23.443 --> 02:37:24.343]  Exactly.
[02:37:24.343 --> 02:37:26.444]  Goldwater was terrific.
[02:37:26.444 --> 02:37:37.188]  To me, the Tea Parties are bringing- except on defense, because I think he would have waged offensive wars, which you and I and most of the folks listening to us now would not.
[02:37:37.188 --> 02:37:37.408]  I agree.
[02:37:37.768 --> 02:37:43.333]  And it's like saying, you know, aside from what happened in the theater, Mrs. Lincoln, how did you like the evening?
[02:37:43.333 --> 02:37:52.681]  Because it's a big accept, but generally on the role of the government in the lives of people, generally unlimited government, generally unsound money.
[02:37:52.681 --> 02:37:53.341]  It was terrific.
[02:37:53.341 --> 02:38:03.850]  And I'll tell you this, Alex, when I talk about the virtues of the Tea Party movement, and it could be co-opted, you know, these guys could get elected and they could become victims of Potomac fever.
[02:38:03.850 --> 02:38:04.871]  I don't think it's going to happen.
[02:38:05.611 --> 02:38:10.193]  I say it is a return to our Goldwater roots, not our Reagan roots.
[02:38:10.193 --> 02:38:11.894]  I loved Reagan as a human being.
[02:38:11.894 --> 02:38:15.055]  I loved his sunny, cheerful personality.
[02:38:15.055 --> 02:38:20.437]  I loved his up-from-the-bootstraps story, personal story, and I loved his speeches.
[02:38:20.437 --> 02:38:22.918]  But he was not a libertarian.
[02:38:22.918 --> 02:38:23.378]  That's right!
[02:38:23.378 --> 02:38:24.819]  His rhetoric was good!
[02:38:26.252 --> 02:38:30.655]  I mean, his rhetoric was good, but what we got was something entirely different.
[02:38:30.655 --> 02:38:37.539]  Maybe it's easier to be a libertarian when you're in the legislative branch and you don't have to administer a government.
[02:38:37.539 --> 02:38:38.659]  I will grant you that.
[02:38:38.659 --> 02:38:50.166]  But Goldwater was far purer, far closer to the views of Jefferson, Mises, Hayek, and Alex Jones than Ronald Reagan was.
[02:38:50.700 --> 02:38:54.262]  Okay, Judge, we've only got you here for about another 20 minutes before the show ends.
[02:38:54.262 --> 02:38:58.104]  I want to race through a bunch of issues and then find out what is most important on your radar.
[02:38:58.104 --> 02:38:58.784]  Go right ahead.
[02:38:58.784 --> 02:39:04.306]  But I would imagine, being so well-read, you know the Supreme Court justices and the LA Times covered this.
[02:39:04.306 --> 02:39:09.109]  Here's the headline, First Amendment ruling destined to kill internet-free speech.
[02:39:09.109 --> 02:39:15.472]  They said that in the case of the funeral protesters, who I disagree with, but it's their right,
[02:39:16.272 --> 02:39:22.176]  That they are going to restrict rallies, protests, things that hurt people's feelings.
[02:39:22.176 --> 02:39:24.197]  England has just passed similar laws.
[02:39:24.197 --> 02:39:25.998]  The Cybersecurity Act did this.
[02:39:25.998 --> 02:39:30.881]  They couldn't pass the cyberbullying last year and so they're now legislating from the bench.
[02:39:30.881 --> 02:39:37.165]  They have signaled and said that they are going to rule against rallies and demonstrations that are hurtful.
[02:39:37.985 --> 02:39:41.768]  And one justice said this will also affect internet speech.
[02:39:41.768 --> 02:39:48.132]  That then dovetails with Microsoft proposes government licensing internet access.
[02:39:48.132 --> 02:39:52.935]  I mean, can you speak about the state of free speech in this country?
[02:39:52.935 --> 02:39:53.435]  Here's another one.
[02:39:53.435 --> 02:39:59.859]  Obama administration pressures ISPs to censor websites without even an order.
[02:39:59.859 --> 02:40:04.522]  The White House just tells them what they want taken down outside of a court and it happens.
[02:40:04.522 --> 02:40:06.924]  I mean, this is becoming Maoist China.
[02:40:08.089 --> 02:40:13.871]  Well, I disagree with the view of those who say the court is going to go against free speech.
[02:40:13.871 --> 02:40:15.811]  I was not in the courtroom.
[02:40:15.811 --> 02:40:23.293]  I read a portion of the transcript of the oral argument, and I interrogated the Fox reporter who was in the courtroom.
[02:40:23.293 --> 02:40:31.316]  That Fox reporter, not a lawyer, but a person who covers the Supreme Court for Fox, is of the view that it's going to go in favor of free speech.
[02:40:31.316 --> 02:40:32.356]  And this court
[02:40:32.976 --> 02:40:50.763]  And no court is perfect, and a lot of judges, most of them legislate for the bench, but this Supreme Court, with Stephen's on it before Kagan got there, invalidated laws that prohibited the slaughter of animal on tapes, a horrible thing that I oppose, but free speech.
[02:40:50.763 --> 02:40:58.986]  Invalidated laws that prohibited corporations and labor unions and advocacy groups from getting involved in free speech.
[02:40:59.626 --> 02:41:06.670]  I believe that this case is going to go as horrific as the message is, in favor of the freedom of the messengers in this case.
[02:41:06.670 --> 02:41:10.072]  Okay, well let's hope you're right, and we'll find out soon.
[02:41:10.072 --> 02:41:19.457]  But the other issue is, what about all these moves with cyber security, the Obama kill switch, all these different... Well, that stuff has to be challenged, and it has to be challenged in a couple ways.
[02:41:19.457 --> 02:41:23.059]  One, the way you're doing it by exposing it, because most people don't know about this.
[02:41:23.519 --> 02:41:30.283]  Unless they hear it from you, or Sassel, or Beck, or me, because there are very few national broadcasters addressing this.
[02:41:30.283 --> 02:41:33.565]  And secondly, it needs to be challenged in the political arena.
[02:41:33.565 --> 02:41:40.550]  The people who do it need to be voted out of office or exposed and forced to explain themselves, in which case they'll be forced out of office.
[02:41:40.550 --> 02:41:42.291]  And then, of course, it needs to be challenged.
[02:41:42.831 --> 02:41:46.754]  But the court has been pretty good on First Amendment.
[02:41:46.754 --> 02:41:54.478]  I mean, the court has let circuit court opinions stand, which invalidated efforts to cleanse the internet of pornography.
[02:41:54.478 --> 02:41:58.041]  Whatever you think of pornography, these things were written supposedly to protect children.
[02:41:58.541 --> 02:41:58.901]  We're good.
[02:42:19.582 --> 02:42:27.788]  Of a social conservative, like my college classmate Sam Alito, joining the big government liberals.
[02:42:27.788 --> 02:42:35.053]  We run that risk of them thinking what they know is best for us to watch and listen to and hear.
[02:42:35.053 --> 02:42:45.640]  But if Justice Alito sticks to the guns, so to speak, of those who voted for the First Amendment the last time around, I think the First Amendment will prevail.
[02:42:46.243 --> 02:42:56.905]  Well, even if the court says we don't have a First Amendment, possession is nine-tenths of the law, we need to continue to exercise it, just like McCain-Feingold tried to block free speech.
[02:42:56.905 --> 02:42:58.246]  People just ignored it.
[02:42:58.246 --> 02:42:59.546]  Absolutely.
[02:42:59.546 --> 02:43:00.626]  Absolutely.
[02:43:00.626 --> 02:43:07.608]  I mean, the other thing is, I mean, the judgment against Phillips here
[02:43:08.368 --> 02:43:11.070]  ...was provided under some Maryland law.
[02:43:11.070 --> 02:43:13.971]  Now, some states would not have such laws.
[02:43:13.971 --> 02:43:17.813]  Some states would say, you can stand on the sidewalk and say whatever you want.
[02:43:17.813 --> 02:43:24.677]  This creates the bizarre conundrum of the First Amendment meaning different things in different states.
[02:43:24.677 --> 02:43:33.062]  So if the Supreme Court says, this is okay, we're going to uphold this judgment to about $8 million, which the church doesn't have, so it may just be a paper judgment.
[02:43:33.783 --> 02:43:37.751]  That may not be the law of the land in all 50 states.
[02:43:37.751 --> 02:43:39.875]  My own home state of New Jersey...
[02:43:40.732 --> 02:43:43.013]  Regrettably, one of the most progressive in the Union.
[02:43:43.013 --> 02:43:46.715]  Nevertheless, he's superb on free speech.
[02:43:46.715 --> 02:43:57.660]  Under the New Jersey Constitution, you can stand on the street corner and say whatever you want, to whomever you want, at any time you want, as long as you're not, you know, preventing people from walking or preventing traffic.
[02:43:57.660 --> 02:43:58.200]  I understand.
[02:43:58.200 --> 02:44:04.963]  Judge, on this legal issues, obviously you could teach us all day and we appreciate you joining us on that subject.
[02:44:04.963 --> 02:44:08.224]  But last question, when should the court then release their ruling?
[02:44:08.224 --> 02:44:09.105]  In the next two, three months?
[02:44:10.530 --> 02:44:19.875]  Um, you know, they release a bunch of rulings three times right before Christmas, in the middle of the spring, or I'd say around April, and then in June.
[02:44:19.875 --> 02:44:22.336]  I think this one's probably going to come in April.
[02:44:22.336 --> 02:44:24.917]  I don't think this is going to come until next year.
[02:44:24.917 --> 02:44:30.400]  Not for any political reason, but just because the process of getting something like this done takes time.
[02:44:30.600 --> 02:44:33.423]  Okay, I've got a stack of other important issues.
[02:44:33.423 --> 02:44:36.907]  You talked about the Federal Reserve getting more power.
[02:44:36.907 --> 02:44:39.390]  It did get more power out of the crisis it created.
[02:44:39.390 --> 02:44:43.354]  They were able to block a true audit in the Senate.
[02:44:43.354 --> 02:44:44.575]  Now it's being reported that
[02:44:46.961 --> 02:44:52.427]  821.1 billion of US Treasury notes are now owned by the private Federal Reserve.
[02:44:52.427 --> 02:44:59.574]  They are now the second biggest owner of our debt next to Communist China.
[02:44:59.574 --> 02:45:02.117]  The Federal Reserve is moving ahead with quantitative easing.
[02:45:02.117 --> 02:45:03.158]  The dollar is plunging.
[02:45:03.158 --> 02:45:04.880]  Gold is going up.
[02:45:04.880 --> 02:45:07.262]  It's becoming more and more clear that we have a financial
[02:45:09.444 --> 02:45:10.525]  We're good to go.
[02:45:30.478 --> 02:45:32.759]  Well, I actually think it's worse than that, Alex.
[02:45:32.759 --> 02:45:40.602]  I was on air with one of my colleagues speculating about what might happen if the Republicans take the House and the Republicans take the Senate.
[02:45:40.602 --> 02:45:48.685]  And the colleague said, well, at least they can refuse to fund FINREG, the Financial Regulatory Act, the so-called Dodd-Frank Act.
[02:45:48.685 --> 02:45:51.926]  And I said, well, most respectfully, they can't.
[02:45:52.609 --> 02:45:54.832]  It's under the domain of the Federal Reserve.
[02:45:54.832 --> 02:45:56.153]  It doesn't need any funding.
[02:45:56.153 --> 02:45:59.477]  The Federal Reserve can print its own money and fund it itself.
[02:45:59.477 --> 02:46:03.942]  So, the Federal Reserve is probably the most powerful entity on the planet.
[02:46:03.942 --> 02:46:06.925]  More powerful than the rest of the federal government combined.
[02:46:06.925 --> 02:46:08.347]  It's certainly the most secretive.
[02:46:08.347 --> 02:46:10.289]  This is a one-liner that you've used.
[02:46:10.689 --> 02:46:14.313]  The job of the CIA is to keep and to steal secrets.
[02:46:14.313 --> 02:46:20.619]  We know more about the CIA and what it has kept and what it has stolen than we do about the Federal Reserve.
[02:46:20.619 --> 02:46:27.186]  And the Federal Reserve announced yesterday that it's ready to infuse another trillion dollars of cash.
[02:46:28.109 --> 02:46:28.309]  I think so.
[02:46:45.098 --> 02:47:03.429]  When Jefferson and company were running the government in 1792, the Congress enacted the Coinage Act of 1792, which made it punishable by death for anybody in the government to clip coins stated differently to devalue the money.
[02:47:04.224 --> 02:47:12.936]  The Federal Reserve is doing exactly that which was death penalty eligible when sound money existed in the country.
[02:47:12.936 --> 02:47:15.960]  This is the most serious of problems we face.
[02:47:15.960 --> 02:47:18.063]  We need to audit the Federal Reserve.
[02:47:18.063 --> 02:47:18.944]  We need to audit gold.
[02:47:19.104 --> 02:47:20.385]  Are we going to get that?
[02:47:46.707 --> 02:47:52.031]  I just put this question to Ron Paul, not an hour ago, in the taping of my weekend show.
[02:47:52.031 --> 02:48:01.977]  He thinks we're going to get these answers, but not tomorrow, and not as a result of this election, and not even during the presidency of this president, but in our lifetimes.
[02:48:01.977 --> 02:48:16.487]  He thinks we will reach such a crisis point, which he calls a revolution, where the government will be forced to expose what it's been doing, what it owns, what it's been cheating, what it's been stealing, or the government will collapse like the government of the Soviet Union did.
[02:48:17.147 --> 02:48:28.798]  Well, Judge, that's the issue, is that you have the Vatican, you have the City of London within London, the private banking group, you have Cheney a few years ago saying, I'm my own branch of government.
[02:48:28.798 --> 02:48:32.161]  The Federal Reserve has actually gotten Congress to legislate that.
[02:48:33.120 --> 02:48:36.885]  They are literally the foxes guarding the hen houses.
[02:48:36.885 --> 02:48:48.080]  They are destroying our society and they are the US version of the most powerful thing on the planet, the private banking cartel that is now openly announcing
[02:48:48.681 --> 02:48:49.662]  World Government.
[02:48:49.662 --> 02:48:51.584]  It's either us or them.
[02:48:51.584 --> 02:48:54.586]  And Ron Paul put out a video that's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:48:54.586 --> 02:49:00.411]  We've got him on tomorrow, by the way, and I'm going to ask him about this, but he said basically what you just said.
[02:49:00.411 --> 02:49:07.357]  He said we're now at that critical juncture or entering it where either they're going to collapse the economy, use that as an excuse for martial law,
[02:49:08.662 --> 02:49:12.644]  Or they've miscalculated and we're going to be able to get our country back.
[02:49:12.644 --> 02:49:17.486]  But regardless, we're entering waters that are extremely violent.
[02:49:17.486 --> 02:49:19.827]  The fireworks have just begun.
[02:49:19.827 --> 02:49:21.989]  We are at such a critical juncture.
[02:49:21.989 --> 02:49:22.689]  Can you speak to that?
[02:49:24.341 --> 02:49:28.828]  Well, Ron Paul did say pretty much the same thing to me.
[02:49:28.828 --> 02:49:30.050]  I mean, God bless him.
[02:49:30.050 --> 02:49:37.361]  He's fearless and he's consistent and he's the most effective watcher of the government from inside the government that we have.
[02:49:37.361 --> 02:49:40.085]  But he says that two things are going to happen and I agree with him.
[02:49:40.805 --> 02:49:45.446]  The revolution, which we are in the early stages of, will first cause our empire to crumble.
[02:49:45.446 --> 02:49:58.490]  I mean, we simply will not be able to finance over 900 permanent military installations all around the globe, and those people will be free from our occupation.
[02:49:58.490 --> 02:50:04.391]  They will also be bereft of us spending cash there, but we'll have more cash to spend here at home.
[02:50:04.391 --> 02:50:06.452]  That's the first stage of the revolution.
[02:50:06.452 --> 02:50:09.873]  Now, the second stage of the revolution, in his view and in mine,
[02:50:10.513 --> 02:50:13.475]  It's sort of like what happened when the Soviet Union fell.
[02:50:13.475 --> 02:50:22.321]  When the Soviet Union fell, the countries that it had occupied from before, during, and after World War II became free countries.
[02:50:22.321 --> 02:50:30.187]  And many of them became freer than the United States in terms of the engine of the free market, a truly free market, some with even a flat tax.
[02:50:30.367 --> 02:50:33.929]  That might result in things like Texas saying to Washington, D.C.
[02:50:33.929 --> 02:50:34.909]  Stay the heck out!
[02:50:51.721 --> 02:51:00.067]  When we joined to this country, our resolution, which was enacted by the Texas Legislature and the Congress, said we can leave whenever we want.
[02:51:00.067 --> 02:51:00.987]  Guess what?
[02:51:00.987 --> 02:51:02.808]  That time has come.
[02:51:02.808 --> 02:51:04.369]  That may actually happen.
[02:51:21.741 --> 02:51:23.282]  They have it in writing, Alex.
[02:51:23.282 --> 02:51:26.505]  Figuratively and literally in writing that they have the right to do it.
[02:51:26.505 --> 02:51:31.189]  I mean, I don't know how strong Governor Perry is personally.
[02:51:31.189 --> 02:51:36.434]  I have discussed this with him off the record, and I'm going to be with him in Houston on Monday.
[02:51:36.434 --> 02:51:40.677]  But this is a very serious issue, which resonates with many people in Texas.
[02:51:40.677 --> 02:51:42.479]  It resonates with many people around the world.
[02:51:42.979 --> 02:52:08.563]  Look, earlier this week, a federal judge in Montana ruled that handguns made entirely in Montana, of raw material taken from the earth in Montana, using ammunition made entirely in Montana, taken from raw material from the earth in Montana, that never left Montana, were engaged in interstate commerce, and therefore could be regulated by the federal government.
[02:52:08.923 --> 02:52:26.349]  I hope and pray that that is overruled, but it is so nonsensical, so violative of people's natural rights, that at some point, people simply won't listen to, or abide by, a decision as weird, wacky, unconstitutional, and unnatural as that.
[02:52:26.349 --> 02:52:37.553]  So these boomlets of freedom, these drawing of the lines to Washington saying, thou shalt not pass, are happening throughout the country, and the government itself is causing them to happen.
[02:52:38.581 --> 02:52:41.884]  Judge, I want to shift gears into a similar issue.
[02:52:41.884 --> 02:52:47.550]  USA Today, McDonald's, 29 other firms get health care coverage waivers.
[02:52:47.550 --> 02:52:50.473]  That's just like when Obama came out in Congress.
[02:52:50.473 --> 02:52:57.239]  If a GM dealership had given a lot of money to a local Democrat congressperson, they could keep their dealership.
[02:52:57.239 --> 02:52:59.882]  But if they were Republican or hadn't given the protection money,
[02:53:00.662 --> 02:53:04.605]  They would have it taken away when the Feds took over GM.
[02:53:04.605 --> 02:53:14.770]  Is this not pure discrimination, pure selective enforcement, pure unfair weights and measures to say that 30 major mega U.S.
[02:53:14.770 --> 02:53:26.737]  companies out of 29 million small companies that get discriminated against, they have to buy health insurance for their employees or basically shut down, but 30 big companies, they're exempt.
[02:53:26.737 --> 02:53:29.299]  I mean, is that not just totally mafia?
[02:53:30.595 --> 02:53:32.197]  Well, it's totally mafia.
[02:53:32.197 --> 02:53:34.020]  It's also totally unconstitutional.
[02:53:34.020 --> 02:53:35.622]  The framers feared this.
[02:53:35.622 --> 02:53:43.975]  You know, Jefferson and Hamilton rarely agreed on anything in public, but they both agreed that when the public treasury becomes a public trough...
[02:53:44.887 --> 02:53:45.947]  And the people learned that.
[02:53:45.947 --> 02:53:52.090]  They will send to Washington only those who will promise to give them the biggest piece of the federal pie, and they're right.
[02:53:52.090 --> 02:54:06.235]  I mean, when General Motors was going to close down an enormous warehouse, not a dealership, but a warehouse, in Dorchester, Massachusetts, they got a little phone call, and suddenly, that warehouse was off the list of facilities to be closed.
[02:54:06.235 --> 02:54:09.976]  Now, who represents Dorchester, Massachusetts, in the House of Representatives?
[02:54:10.791 --> 02:54:15.914]  Congressman Barney Frank, who supervised the federal bailout of General Motors.
[02:54:15.914 --> 02:54:28.903]  So, the framers knew that the government couldn't operate a business because the government would operate it like it would operate the post office, or like it operates Amtrak, or Medicare, or Medicaid, or Social Security, or like it operated the mustang.
[02:54:28.903 --> 02:54:34.647]  Exactly, the judge... It'll collapse, it'll be run on a political model instead of an economic model.
[02:54:34.647 --> 02:54:37.869]  The government's patrons and friends will get rich at our expense.
[02:54:38.149 --> 02:54:43.631]  Yes, and it turns into a banana republic because nobody can produce because it just gets stolen from you.
[02:54:43.631 --> 02:54:47.692]  So now you're not the U.S., you're Guatemala or you're czarist Russia.
[02:54:47.692 --> 02:54:54.055]  Now expanding on the whole geopolitical outlook, clearly the Rand Corporation said this two years ago.
[02:54:54.955 --> 02:55:03.842]  You've got Obama, people, Robert Shapiro telling the Financial Times of London, minus an Oklahoma City or a 9-11 to make him look strong.
[02:55:03.842 --> 02:55:06.043]  They're not going to be able to get their agenda through.
[02:55:06.043 --> 02:55:09.366]  Now Obama's issuing terror alerts right ahead of the election.
[02:55:09.366 --> 02:55:16.191]  Even mainstream media says, you know, that it looks like an October surprise, kind of like Governor Ridge admitted they were issuing fake terror alerts in 2004.
[02:55:17.972 --> 02:55:26.918]  For the Bush administration, I'm concerned they're going to try to start a wider global war as a pretext to have the empire expand and not implode.
[02:55:26.918 --> 02:55:27.859]  Your take on that?
[02:55:27.859 --> 02:55:29.200]  I agree with you.
[02:55:29.200 --> 02:55:41.569]  You know, it's a truism going back to, well, going back to the time of George Washington, but articulated by the late great Marine Corps General Smedley Butler and articulated brilliantly by Professor Bob Higgs.
[02:55:42.149 --> 02:55:46.174]  War is the health of the state, and both parties are the war party.
[02:55:46.174 --> 02:55:55.625]  You know, the Republicans like certain things, the Democrats like certain things, but they both like war, because they can scare people into surrendering their property and their freedom to the government.
[02:55:55.625 --> 02:56:01.552]  George Orwell predicted this brilliantly in 1984, in which he hypothecated a war that was permanently...
[02:56:05.317 --> 02:56:09.700]  It was permanently at war, so the government could always micromanage it.
[02:56:09.700 --> 02:56:16.926]  This president can claim to be as benign and pacifist-oriented as he wants.
[02:56:16.926 --> 02:56:25.873]  George Bush could have claimed to be as more interested in domestic affairs and having no interest in foreign affairs as he wants.
[02:56:25.873 --> 02:56:28.815]  They both want war because it lets them be a little prince.
[02:56:29.416 --> 02:56:33.947]  And every president that has waged a war has acted like a little prince.
[02:56:33.947 --> 02:56:36.874]  And most of the powers that we have given to those presidents in wartime...
[02:56:37.902 --> 02:56:38.963]  The presidency still has.
[02:56:38.963 --> 02:56:46.309]  They get to act as a prince for their special interests and loot society, but they've now basically killed the Golden Goose.
[02:56:46.309 --> 02:56:50.412]  They've destroyed us, and finally, I just wanted to note the New York Times.
[02:56:50.412 --> 02:56:58.199]  Rogue trader at Social General gets three years in prison and had to pay 4.9 billion euros of the ill-gotten money.
[02:56:58.199 --> 02:57:04.344]  I want to make sure all these fellow reserve owners who were involved in the swindle, I want to make sure they've got to pay that money back.
[02:57:04.944 --> 02:57:17.359]  I do, and one of the things I'm going to ask Ron Paul is, when you become President, will you have your Attorney General indict the Federal Reserve members who robbed and stole from us blind?
[02:57:17.748 --> 02:57:25.890]  You've also got Colonel Anthony Schaefer, from what I've heard, with some of the most bombshell information dealing with the cover-up of 9-11 on your show this weekend.
[02:57:25.890 --> 02:57:31.872]  The website, of course, is judgenap.com, but give us the showtimes for folks that don't know on Fox Business.
[02:57:31.872 --> 02:57:36.393]  Fox Business Network, not Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, 10 a.m.
[02:57:36.393 --> 02:57:37.673]  Eastern, 8 p.m.
[02:57:37.673 --> 02:57:41.374]  Eastern Saturday, 7 and 11 p.m.
[02:57:41.374 --> 02:57:42.455]  Eastern Sunday.
[02:57:42.455 --> 02:57:43.215]  Colonel Schaefer,
[02:57:43.815 --> 02:57:52.963]  We'll reveal a cover-up involving the 9-11 commissioners themselves, and who among them was protecting whom.
[02:57:52.963 --> 02:57:55.305]  This is groundbreaking information.
[02:57:55.305 --> 02:57:59.648]  We look forward to getting Schaefer back on the broadcast ourselves.
[02:57:59.648 --> 02:58:02.491]  Judge Andrew Napolitano, thanks for inviting me on your show.
[02:58:02.491 --> 02:58:04.733]  I look forward to being on, what, in November?
[02:58:04.733 --> 02:58:05.333]  Absolutely.
[02:58:05.333 --> 02:58:09.837]  We'll be going daily, I think starting Monday, November 15th, and you'll be on with us.
[02:58:10.694 --> 02:58:12.775]  Well, that's awesome, and I know you're the real deal.
[02:58:12.775 --> 02:58:15.697]  You've never wavered, never faltered, never flip-flopped.
[02:58:15.697 --> 02:58:20.621]  I can say that you are the real McCoy, and thank God that you're going daily on Fox Business.
[02:58:20.621 --> 02:58:22.042]  Judge, we'll talk to you again soon.
[02:58:22.042 --> 02:58:22.662]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:58:22.662 --> 02:58:23.483]  Thanks for having me.
[02:58:23.483 --> 02:58:23.963]  God bless.
[02:58:23.963 --> 02:58:24.263]  You bet.
[02:58:24.263 --> 02:58:24.823]  God bless you.
[02:58:40.757 --> 02:58:40.903]  Yep.
