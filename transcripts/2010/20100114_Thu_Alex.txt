[00:00:00.353 --> 00:00:05.418]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:05.758 --> 00:00:08.080]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:00:10.982 --> 00:00:18.649]  We are simulcasting the last two hours of the syndicated radio broadcast right now and live in color at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.915]  Adds a whole other dimension to it because you can actually see the documents, the video clips that we're talking about here on the radio.
[00:00:25.435 --> 00:00:26.196]  You see this man?
[00:00:27.677 --> 00:00:33.281]  This man right here is Cass R. Sunstein, University of Chicago Law School.
[00:00:33.321 --> 00:00:41.386]  He wrote this in conjunction with Harvard University Law School Public Law and Legal Theory Research paper, and this was from 2008.
[00:00:41.947 --> 00:00:51.994]  He's now becoming a key member of the Obama administration over information and technology.
[00:00:52.634 --> 00:00:55.036]  And that's why this is so important.
[00:00:55.056 --> 00:00:59.660]  He'll be the head of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.
[00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:15.833]  And in the white paper, the 29-page white paper that you see on screen, titled Conspiracy Theories, he labels anyone that doesn't believe global warming as man-made.
[00:01:17.254 --> 00:01:20.377]  Anyone who believes the official story of Kennedy's a lie.
[00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.692]  Anyone who believes the CIA is involved in drug dealing.
[00:01:25.412 --> 00:01:32.556]  If you believe government ever did anything corrupt, ever, you are a conspiracy theorist.
[00:01:32.576 --> 00:01:33.917]  So he first labels you.
[00:01:34.778 --> 00:01:39.540]  That'd be like in Russia, them labeling you a capitalist.
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.001]  It's just a way to demonize you.
[00:01:41.722 --> 00:01:47.365]  During the Soviet era, or in Nazi Germany, labeling someone a communist or a Jew.
[00:01:49.096 --> 00:01:50.317]  And that's the term they use.
[00:01:50.357 --> 00:01:57.005]  I mean, national television says that if you don't agree with government-run healthcare, you're a racist, or you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:01:57.085 --> 00:01:58.226]  This is the term they use.
[00:01:58.286 --> 00:02:02.270]  If you say the banker bailout was a fraud, they call it a conspiracy theory.
[00:02:02.871 --> 00:02:09.578]  If you say that water is wet, the sky is blue, and birds sing, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:21.868]  Basically, it's a way to just set the parameters, to set the narrative of the debate and say, we are the boss, you're not allowed to question anything we do.
[00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:37.279]  And if you critically think, or read legislation, or if you do anything other than watch football and suck your thumb, or go get collagen injections in your lips, if you do anything but party and just let us run everything,
[00:02:38.783 --> 00:03:08.005]  You know, you're good if you just stand down and let us run everything, but if you question anything, you're a conspiracy theorist, and we want to, and they're already doing this, infiltrate your group, and it says your peaceful group, any organization that questions the government, and we need to incite, as the government, for you to commit violence, to run off reasonable pacifist in your group, and so we can have you arrested and, quote, break up your group.
[00:03:09.844 --> 00:03:13.446]  And I read this last night and I already knew all of this.
[00:03:14.186 --> 00:03:18.128]  It was declassified in 1971 that since the 40s they'd been doing this.
[00:03:19.048 --> 00:03:31.354]  And I'd read all their tricks and seen the tricks being used against us and it came out the Pentagon for decades has been spying and COINTELPRO and infighting and planting bombs all over the world and in the U.S.
[00:03:31.394 --> 00:03:32.855]  to blame it on their political enemies.
[00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:35.628]  They do this over and over again.
[00:03:35.668 --> 00:03:36.649]  The FBI does it.
[00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:38.370]  They have huge divisions that do it.
[00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:45.015]  But that had to be declassified by Congress, wresting it away from the FBI.
[00:03:46.276 --> 00:03:49.339]  It was more than a 10-year battle to get this in the 1970s.
[00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:55.644]  Now, this guy publishes this in full public view.
[00:03:57.205 --> 00:03:58.865]  And he is calling for crimes!
[00:03:59.626 --> 00:04:07.908]  It is a crime to try to get somebody into my office, somebody we hire, and to try to have them to get us to commit crimes.
[00:04:08.728 --> 00:04:11.569]  Remember something similar that the FBI did and the U.S.
[00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:12.689]  Attorney did with Tommy Chong.
[00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:13.989]  We've interviewed him about this.
[00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:23.852]  Tommy Chong, actor, comedian, no criminal record, his son's got a pipe company selling pipes that are legal except in a few counties in the U.S., thousands of counties.
[00:04:25.228 --> 00:04:29.710]  It took them four-plus years to get someone hired into their factory.
[00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.351]  Hundreds of times, the U.S.
[00:04:32.391 --> 00:04:37.734]  Attorney, through other names, tried to order the pipes into that county, where it was illegal.
[00:04:38.394 --> 00:04:50.699]  They finally had to get someone employed there, who wasn't even in shipping, to go in and pack it and ship it, and the federal courts said, yeah, we went in, we mailed the pipe, but Tommy Chong goes to prison.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.340]  Folks,
[00:04:52.020 --> 00:05:05.344]  We don't sell glass pipes, but if I hire the wrong person, they'll come in here and ship something like that out, and they'll say in federal court, yes, we came in, we planted it, and the courts are so corrupt, they'll say, Alex Jones goes to prison!
[00:05:06.945 --> 00:05:19.349]  Now, it came out that Hal Turner, in fact, pull up Kurt Nimmo's excellent article, from the federal court documents, this has been in major newspapers, we just linked to them, that Hal Turner, one of the top five Nazis in the U.S.,
[00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:26.053]  Is an FBI agent, not an informant, an agent for national security.
[00:05:26.474 --> 00:05:27.978]  Ultra top secret clearance.
[00:05:29.577 --> 00:05:30.798]  I told you that a decade ago.
[00:05:31.018 --> 00:05:31.758]  Who does he attack?
[00:05:31.918 --> 00:05:32.139]  Me.
[00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.060]  They also want to radicalize the message.
[00:05:35.441 --> 00:05:43.265]  They want to radicalize mainline libertarians, conservatives, so we can be politically demonized, so we don't become mainstream and take our country back.
[00:05:43.926 --> 00:05:47.588]  That's why if you say you don't want big government, I don't want healthcare.
[00:05:48.228 --> 00:05:52.051]  I think it's a boondoggle to insurance companies to raise our taxes and cut Medicare and Medicaid.
[00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:55.711]  Oh, you don't like black people, Chris Matthews says.
[00:05:56.171 --> 00:05:57.472]  Carlos Watson says.
[00:05:57.512 --> 00:05:58.273]  They all say it.
[00:05:58.573 --> 00:05:59.174]  Keith Oberman.
[00:05:59.654 --> 00:06:02.376]  That's a talking point of COINTELPRO.
[00:06:02.396 --> 00:06:05.218]  And you're like, what does race have to do with this?
[00:06:05.238 --> 00:06:07.820]  We weren't talking about black people.
[00:06:09.982 --> 00:06:16.527]  Every time you talk about corrupt banks, I have newspapers calling me every week going, Mr. Jones, does that mean you think Jews are evil?
[00:06:16.907 --> 00:06:18.909]  And I say, no, I'm talking about banks here.
[00:06:18.929 --> 00:06:20.310]  You know, they stole money.
[00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.411]  They should be held accountable.
[00:06:23.732 --> 00:06:26.313]  Chris Matthews is coming here Sunday to interview me.
[00:06:26.594 --> 00:06:32.237]  I said, let me guess, talking to his producer, you're going to cut from the Ku Klux Klan to me.
[00:06:33.037 --> 00:06:34.978]  And they laughed and said, yeah, that's basically it.
[00:06:36.239 --> 00:06:38.320]  And I said, well, I guess I can't say no.
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.842]  You're just going to play clips of me from other news channels and mix me in.
[00:06:41.862 --> 00:06:44.164]  And I said, fine, I'm not going to be a coward.
[00:06:44.204 --> 00:06:47.946]  Even though it's a rigged, taped interview, I'll stand up to the dragon.
[00:06:48.486 --> 00:06:50.047]  I'm not looking forward to it, though.
[00:06:50.805 --> 00:06:56.068]  I mean, but I'm going to bring this stuff up to Matthews, but of course he'll be taping it so it'll never be seen.
[00:06:56.288 --> 00:06:57.809]  He'll be able to cut out what he wants.
[00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.852]  Now, I want to take my time this hour going over this.
[00:07:02.152 --> 00:07:06.575]  Not just how they're doing it and the history of it and what's currently happening, but how you can counter it.
[00:07:07.455 --> 00:07:09.277]  And the fact that they're losing their fight.
[00:07:10.236 --> 00:07:12.096]  Why do you think the feds bombed Oklahoma City?
[00:07:12.777 --> 00:07:15.157]  To demonize the conservative and libertarian movement.
[00:07:15.497 --> 00:07:20.498]  And if you've researched that case, a hundred percent evidence the BATF bombed it.
[00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:22.839]  One hundred percent on record.
[00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:27.860]  And they had to kill coroners, police officers, you name it, in Oklahoma City to cover that up.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:28.440]  Okay?
[00:07:29.941 --> 00:07:35.602]  And it came out in federal documents that the Southern Poverty Law Center was running Elohim City that McVeigh was at.
[00:07:36.242 --> 00:07:37.062]  Running it!
[00:07:38.263 --> 00:07:39.223]  Every case, folks,
[00:07:40.768 --> 00:07:46.773]  They don't infiltrate white supremacists and peace activists and mainline conservatives and in the Fed groups.
[00:07:48.354 --> 00:07:50.316]  They are there trying to shut them down.
[00:07:50.456 --> 00:07:54.279]  And in the case of white supremacists, they don't just infiltrate them.
[00:07:54.359 --> 00:07:55.560]  They found them.
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:56.381]  They run them.
[00:07:56.661 --> 00:08:01.144]  Or they found other patriot groups to then attack other patriot groups.
[00:08:01.585 --> 00:08:04.747]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is their full Pentagon operation.
[00:08:04.967 --> 00:08:07.510]  Now, I'm going to go to Watson in this segment and the next and then let him go.
[00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:10.112]  But he wrote the most detailed article on this.
[00:08:11.568 --> 00:08:19.931]  At PrisonPlanet.com, give people a document cam shot, Obama information czar outlined plan for government to infiltrate conspiracy groups.
[00:08:20.491 --> 00:08:22.532]  Again, a modern version of COINTELPRO.
[00:08:22.952 --> 00:08:23.632]  And I've read this.
[00:08:23.672 --> 00:08:24.392]  This is illegal.
[00:08:24.432 --> 00:08:25.653]  He's calling for illegal stuff.
[00:08:26.373 --> 00:08:38.077]  In fact, I've got the encyclopedia here on COINTELPRO, and it says, COINTELPRO, acronym for Counterintelligence Program, was a series of covert and often illegal
[00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:51.645]  Projects conducted by the United States Federal Government of investigation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, aimed at investigating and disturbing, disrupting, dissonant political organizations within the United States.
[00:08:52.085 --> 00:08:58.729]  The FBI used covert operations from its inception, and then it goes into the declassified COINTELPRO.
[00:08:59.389 --> 00:09:02.090]  Okay, that is declassified COINTELPRO.
[00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:03.911]  You can read thousands of pages of documents.
[00:09:04.371 --> 00:09:07.453]  This guy, part of the Obama administration,
[00:09:08.755 --> 00:09:22.939]  This guy, with billions of dollars at his fingertips, smugly and arrogantly thinks he can set the precedent to come out in the open and call for modern 21st century COINTELPRO.
[00:09:23.239 --> 00:09:25.239]  Now it's all going on already.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.721]  But this guy lays out all their tricks and that's what blew me away.
[00:09:30.701 --> 00:09:38.423]  He talks about how we've been discredited, the government's discredited, so what we've got to do is we've got to pose as other conspiracy theorists, that's anybody that questions government,
[00:09:39.724 --> 00:09:46.075]  To counter the real people that are questioning.
[00:09:46.596 --> 00:09:47.417]  And he talks about
[00:09:48.536 --> 00:09:49.716]  It's all in COINTELPRO.
[00:09:49.956 --> 00:09:57.199]  The number one thing they do is if somebody starts selling books and videos to fund an organization, starts becoming successful, they say, oh, they're getting rich, they've got money.
[00:09:57.459 --> 00:10:00.660]  That's how they broke up all the other groups that were real in the 60s.
[00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.040]  They send in people to cause violence.
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.641]  They spread lies about you.
[00:10:04.661 --> 00:10:11.283]  Their favorite COINTELPRO is to say leaders of the real movement are threatening to kill people.
[00:10:11.883 --> 00:10:18.505]  I wondered why I would get calls at the office from people and talk to them and nothing would be said, and then they would go say I'd threatened to kill them.
[00:10:18.986 --> 00:10:32.271]  And this happens over and over again, where now, if it's somebody I don't know, I turn speakerphone on and go, guys, I need you to listen, and a lot of times I just hit a record button and start recording, because I've got to protect myself.
[00:10:32.311 --> 00:10:33.551]  Folks, they're coming at me.
[00:10:33.891 --> 00:10:36.732]  I've had them try to drop stuff off at the office and then claim stuff.
[00:10:37.112 --> 00:10:40.954]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, we've got them coming out of the woodwork.
[00:10:41.434 --> 00:10:50.059]  Here, and then to look at this smiley face guy in the Obama administration, about to be confirmed as a czar, he just thinks it's all funny!
[00:10:51.079 --> 00:10:52.980]  If you did this to him, you'd go to prison!
[00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.881]  But see, he is an anointed one.
[00:10:55.502 --> 00:10:57.523]  Watson, I've had you on hold while I've been ranting.
[00:10:57.603 --> 00:11:00.224]  It's just, we have been through hell with these people.
[00:11:00.244 --> 00:11:05.927]  He talks about how to go on message boards, how to get infighting going, how to make up lies.
[00:11:06.327 --> 00:11:09.029]  We witness what they do every day, don't we?
[00:11:10.711 --> 00:11:13.052]  Yeah, we've been tracking it for a long time, Alex.
[00:11:13.412 --> 00:11:22.355]  And, um, as I wrote in the article, uh, we have anonymous posters, and we allow them to be anonymous by our system.
[00:11:22.375 --> 00:11:27.157]  I mean, we could make everyone register, but it'd just mean a lot less discussion in there.
[00:11:27.597 --> 00:11:29.417]  So we allow people to be anonymous.
[00:11:30.118 --> 00:11:37.040]  And then, from the back end, I can see where these people have got the same IP address, so you know it's the same person.
[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.621]  But they're posting under different names.
[00:11:40.242 --> 00:11:44.165]  And then creating a fake conversation with these alter egos.
[00:11:44.425 --> 00:11:45.366]  And that's what he says.
[00:11:45.446 --> 00:11:45.867]  Stay there.
[00:11:46.127 --> 00:11:49.810]  He says create fake consensus with multiple posters.
[00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:52.152]  He's blueprinting what we're witnessing.
[00:11:52.892 --> 00:11:54.333]  And they don't even hide their IPs.
[00:11:54.373 --> 00:11:55.014]  They're government.
[00:11:55.394 --> 00:12:00.118]  I mean, the government is attacking us and trying to get people to commit violence, too.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.921]  This is not a drill.
[00:12:04.001 --> 00:12:05.923]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:12:08.406 --> 00:12:15.530]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:19.973]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[00:12:20.013 --> 00:12:30.339]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[00:12:30.779 --> 00:12:39.042]  For any circumstance, these and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[00:12:39.362 --> 00:12:40.022]  But listen up!
[00:12:40.042 --> 00:12:46.244]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[00:12:46.304 --> 00:12:48.105]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[00:12:48.145 --> 00:12:50.246]  That's hideyourguns.com.
[00:12:50.306 --> 00:12:51.026]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:12:51.066 --> 00:12:53.367]  Before they come for your guns, hideyourguns.com right now.
[00:13:01.835 --> 00:13:05.484]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:13:05.865 --> 00:13:08.872]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:13:09.112 --> 00:13:10.535]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:13:11.218 --> 00:13:13.880]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:13:13.901 --> 00:13:20.106]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:13:20.286 --> 00:13:25.331]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:13:25.491 --> 00:13:28.634]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[00:13:28.754 --> 00:13:35.480]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.681]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:13:37.921 --> 00:13:39.261]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:13:39.521 --> 00:13:41.782]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:13:41.982 --> 00:13:43.822]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:13:44.082 --> 00:13:48.884]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:14:00.484 --> 00:14:06.708]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:14:07.168 --> 00:14:14.933]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:14:15.274 --> 00:14:23.159]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:14:23.459 --> 00:14:28.202]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:14:28.522 --> 00:14:33.267]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:14:33.747 --> 00:14:37.611]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:14:38.112 --> 00:14:39.133]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[00:15:51.164 --> 00:15:51.224]  1-800-580-7310.
[00:16:02.813 --> 00:16:06.681]  And I want to put all the COINTELPRO operators on notice.
[00:16:07.583 --> 00:16:14.176]  If they ever run a successful operation against us physically, which he calls for inside people's operations,
[00:16:16.209 --> 00:16:21.331]  We do have the assets and the understanding to track it back and then sue you.
[00:16:21.991 --> 00:16:25.212]  I'm not just some bumbling little liberal or conservative group.
[00:16:25.452 --> 00:16:27.012]  You're going to be able to successfully do this.
[00:16:27.072 --> 00:16:31.574]  And I call for criminal investigations against this Obama administration official.
[00:16:31.974 --> 00:16:34.555]  I mean, wait till I read the quotes of what he's calling for.
[00:16:35.255 --> 00:16:41.177]  I mean, if I wrote stuff calling for criminal infiltration, getting people to call for violence, criminal acts,
[00:16:42.397 --> 00:16:43.398]  I would get in big trouble.
[00:16:43.498 --> 00:16:45.440]  They think they're above the law.
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.141]  They think they can get away with all this.
[00:16:47.181 --> 00:16:48.742]  They think it's funny, Paul Watson.
[00:16:49.062 --> 00:16:51.344]  Go ahead and go through some of the stuff they call for in there.
[00:16:52.625 --> 00:16:58.710]  Well, what's interesting about the individual himself is that he's Obama's information czar.
[00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:04.094]  He's the head of information technology out of the White House with executive powers.
[00:17:04.675 --> 00:17:09.919]  And in the past he's called for reformulating the First Amendment and internet censorship.
[00:17:10.639 --> 00:17:11.620]  But what he does in this
[00:17:12.442 --> 00:17:16.403]  29 page document which is linked from the article which you can download.
[00:17:16.423 --> 00:17:26.685]  He first defines what a conspiracy theory is and we find out by his very definition that it's basically anybody who disagrees with the government.
[00:17:27.165 --> 00:17:38.727]  He says that people who believe that some practice or event by reference to the machinations of powerful people have also managed to conceal their role in that event is a conspiracy theory.
[00:17:39.315 --> 00:17:46.419]  Believing that powerful people try to influence events to increase their power or money is a conspiracy theory.
[00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:50.741]  And if you do that, they should infiltrate you and send you to prison.
[00:17:51.402 --> 00:18:04.629]  I mean, if I sit here and say AIG and Goldman Sachs and the Federal Reserve are openly involved in crime, publicly, that doesn't exist because he sets the confines of reality and I need them to come in here and set me up to go to prison.
[00:18:05.629 --> 00:18:05.909]  Right.
[00:18:06.189 --> 00:18:07.570]  And it gets crazier.
[00:18:07.751 --> 00:18:19.599]  On page 5, he says that being exposed to sunlight, the notion that that's healthy to get sun on you, is a false and dangerous conspiracy theory.
[00:18:19.979 --> 00:18:22.761]  So sunlight's bad now, but that's a conspiracy theory.
[00:18:24.002 --> 00:18:24.482]  And then what?
[00:18:24.582 --> 00:18:25.883]  This guy's on a power trip!
[00:18:25.903 --> 00:18:27.485]  They literally think they're God!
[00:18:29.066 --> 00:18:31.667]  The most disturbing thing is on page 14.
[00:18:33.088 --> 00:18:35.110]  You know, it gets worse than him just saying,
[00:18:35.928 --> 00:18:38.890]  Infiltrate groups and get them to provocateur things.
[00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:48.395]  On page 14 he says that the following measures each will have a place under imaginable conditions.
[00:18:48.735 --> 00:18:51.837]  So he's saying they will have a place and he's powerful.
[00:18:51.857 --> 00:18:53.078]  He's got executive powers.
[00:18:53.118 --> 00:18:53.998]  He's in the White House.
[00:18:54.038 --> 00:18:55.679]  He's one of Obama's key advisors.
[00:18:56.419 --> 00:19:00.742]  So each of these measures is going to have a place under this system.
[00:19:00.762 --> 00:19:00.742]  1.
[00:19:01.262 --> 00:19:04.524]  Government might ban conspiracy theorizing.
[00:19:06.099 --> 00:19:08.581]  If you disagree with the government... LITERAL THOUGHT CRIME!
[00:19:08.601 --> 00:19:10.282]  We gotta have a headline from Kurt Nemo!
[00:19:10.322 --> 00:19:11.883]  Calls for Thought Crime Laws!
[00:19:11.964 --> 00:19:20.550]  I mean, there's... If you disagree with the government, if you think that getting out in the sunshine is healthy, then they're gonna ban your free speech.
[00:19:21.431 --> 00:19:20.550]  2.
[00:19:22.231 --> 00:19:28.436]  Government might impose some kind of tax, financial or otherwise, on those who disseminate such theories.
[00:19:28.916 --> 00:19:31.498]  So a tax on disagreeing with the government.
[00:19:31.518 --> 00:19:34.060]  Which is interesting because
[00:19:35.598 --> 00:19:39.560]  Sunstein has called for tax day to be celebrated.
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.581]  He thinks it's wonderful that the government rapes us every year.
[00:19:43.382 --> 00:19:44.582]  So he's a big fan of that.
[00:19:44.862 --> 00:19:46.963]  So make a religion out of the raping, yes.
[00:19:47.563 --> 00:19:51.265]  Now he wants to put a tax on if you think that sunlight's healthy.
[00:19:52.806 --> 00:20:02.430]  Three, government might itself engage in counter-speech, marshalling arguments to discredit conspiracy theories, and then it gets into the infiltration from there on in.
[00:20:03.041 --> 00:20:07.902]  So take our tax money for our speech and give it to government groups to counter us.
[00:20:09.083 --> 00:20:09.603]  Exactly.
[00:20:10.163 --> 00:20:17.105]  And then after he started talking about this infiltration of what he calls conspiracy groups, i.e.
[00:20:17.225 --> 00:20:31.669]  anyone who still has two brain cells to rub together, he says, such as mainstream scientists or the editors of Popular Mechanics, whom government attempts to enlist to give credibility to its rebuttal efforts,
[00:20:32.489 --> 00:20:51.003]  So he's basically admitting that when Popular Mechanics came out and, you know, stood behind the official 9-11 story when it was under the most severe attack back in 2005 is when they first came out, that Popular Mechanics was enlisted by the government to do that.
[00:20:51.463 --> 00:20:53.064]  He openly admits it on page 18.
[00:20:55.424 --> 00:21:02.649]  Well, he goes on to say, we can't use government people, we'll use allies like Popular Mechanics and not let people know that we're funding them.
[00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:04.410]  Exactly.
[00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:07.092]  So that's what was happening.
[00:21:07.112 --> 00:21:08.753]  We knew it, but now they admit it.
[00:21:10.034 --> 00:21:17.919]  What's important to take from this, as I wrote at the end of the article, though, is this proves how much success we've had.
[00:21:18.139 --> 00:21:20.861]  On page three, Sunstein writes, quote,
[00:21:21.348 --> 00:21:32.073]  The existence of both domestic and foreign conspiracy theories, we suggest, is no trivial matter, posing real risks to the government's anti-terrorism policies, whatever the latter may be.
[00:21:32.714 --> 00:21:33.914]  Paul, stay there, stay there!
[00:21:33.934 --> 00:21:36.716]  We're going to come back in five more minutes, go through more key points.
[00:21:37.096 --> 00:21:38.677]  Read the dossier for yourself.
[00:21:39.277 --> 00:21:43.439]  It is just a criminal manifesto of absolute tyranny.
[00:21:43.839 --> 00:21:46.240]  This guy is a monster.
[00:21:46.281 --> 00:21:46.941]  We'll be right back.
[00:21:50.589 --> 00:21:53.576]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:21:54.518 --> 00:21:57.204]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:04.654]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:22:05.034 --> 00:22:08.037]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:22:08.277 --> 00:22:13.061]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:22:13.081 --> 00:22:19.327]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:22:19.468 --> 00:22:21.710]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.530]  Tim Geithner?
[00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:22.971]  Bernanke?
[00:22:23.051 --> 00:22:23.651]  They're arsonists!
[00:22:23.731 --> 00:22:24.992]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:22:25.012 --> 00:22:27.254]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:22:41.144 --> 00:22:48.107]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:23:04.968 --> 00:23:07.690]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:12.175]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:23:13.056 --> 00:23:17.520]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from InfallWars.com.

[00:24:00.063 --> 00:24:02.684]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:24:03.085 --> 00:24:08.047]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:24:08.407 --> 00:24:10.148]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:24:10.449 --> 00:24:15.271]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:24:15.451 --> 00:24:16.412]  How much do you want?
[00:24:16.652 --> 00:24:17.392]  When do you want it?
[00:24:17.772 --> 00:24:19.353]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:24:19.653 --> 00:24:20.474]  When will you need it?
[00:24:20.734 --> 00:24:22.775]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:24:22.935 --> 00:24:24.036]  Will there be any food?
[00:24:24.276 --> 00:24:25.577]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:24:26.257 --> 00:24:28.179]  You're in quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[00:24:28.319 --> 00:24:30.862]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:24:31.042 --> 00:24:34.285]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:24:34.646 --> 00:24:38.129]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:39.451]  How much will you need?
[00:24:39.691 --> 00:24:40.312]  We don't know.
[00:24:40.592 --> 00:24:41.513]  How much do you want?
[00:24:41.693 --> 00:24:42.434]  All you can get.
[00:24:42.634 --> 00:24:43.455]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:24:43.715 --> 00:24:46.477]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:24:46.757 --> 00:24:48.518]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:24:48.538 --> 00:24:49.459]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:27.523]  Now again, I'm going to go through the history of COINTELPRO, what's currently happening, but the big issue here is this guy's talking about banning criticism of government, putting taxes on newspapers and magazines that criticize government, and we see Obama coming out and saying, my new cybersecurity czar will censor the web, the NSA and Army and Air Force will run it.
[00:25:28.696 --> 00:25:32.319]  We see all these headlines about should Obama control the internet.
[00:25:32.719 --> 00:25:40.804]  The cyber security czar, the first one they appointed early last year, in February resigned saying the Pentagon's taking over.
[00:25:40.844 --> 00:25:42.045]  They're spying on everyone.
[00:25:43.986 --> 00:25:47.769]  There's the Wall Street Journal headline, security cyber czar steps down.
[00:25:47.829 --> 00:25:50.711]  So this is real bona fide tyranny.
[00:25:51.704 --> 00:25:54.426]  And he uses an extreme Orwellian example.
[00:25:54.807 --> 00:26:02.813]  If you say 2 plus 2 equals 4, and he says that's a conspiracy theory, he says it's 5, they want it to be idiotic.
[00:26:03.153 --> 00:26:14.322]  They want to set the precedent that they killed Khalid Sheikh Mohammed more than a dozen times, and never retract the last time they claimed they killed him, and then the next time they capture him.
[00:26:16.039 --> 00:26:19.264]  Openly saying we're going to put him on trial after seven years of torture.
[00:26:19.644 --> 00:26:20.605]  Setting these precedents.
[00:26:20.625 --> 00:26:20.986]  Look at this.
[00:26:21.647 --> 00:26:30.218]  COINTELPRO, an acronym for Counter Intelligence Program, was a series of covert and often illegal, that's what he's calling for, projects conducted by...
[00:26:31.308 --> 00:26:37.891]  The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation aimed at investigating and disrupting dissonant political organizations within the United States.
[00:26:38.251 --> 00:26:40.812]  The FBI used covert operations from its inception.
[00:26:40.852 --> 00:26:48.536]  However, formal COINTELPRO operations took place between 1956 and 71, and they took over all the state police, you name it.
[00:26:48.856 --> 00:26:56.500]  The FBI's stated motivation at the time was protecting national security, preventing violence, and maintaining the existing social order of political order.
[00:26:57.637 --> 00:27:07.762]  According to the FBI, 85% of COINTELPRO resources were expended on infiltrating, disrupting, marginalizing, and or subverting groups suspected of being subversive.
[00:27:07.802 --> 00:27:08.403]  Suspected!
[00:27:09.656 --> 00:27:12.617]  And then, this was what was popular, so they only released this at the time.
[00:27:12.657 --> 00:27:15.358]  It was really after conservatives and the John Birch Society they were going after.
[00:27:15.378 --> 00:27:21.621]  But, such as communist socialist organizations, the women's rights movement, it has now come out the CIA funded that.
[00:27:21.661 --> 00:27:22.341]  That's baloney.
[00:27:22.621 --> 00:27:25.002]  Militant black nationalist groups, they did go after them.
[00:27:25.463 --> 00:27:33.346]  And non-violent civil rights movements, including individuals such as Martin Luther King and others associated with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
[00:27:33.846 --> 00:27:34.727]  And it just goes through.
[00:27:35.247 --> 00:27:41.693]  Now, we know modern COINTELPRO is all peace groups, all libertarian groups, all in the Fed groups.
[00:27:41.933 --> 00:27:45.015]  This has all been leaked or declassified in the last three years.
[00:27:45.296 --> 00:27:51.161]  The MIAC report, the Homeland Security that law enforcement gave us, where they list gun owners, conservatives.
[00:27:51.501 --> 00:27:53.443]  That's what Homeland Security's really set up for.
[00:27:53.483 --> 00:27:54.183]  And here's the deal.
[00:27:54.684 --> 00:28:00.328]  They're now coming out in the open with the new head of TSA.
[00:28:01.049 --> 00:28:02.290]  In fact, I had that in my stack.
[00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:03.450]  Will you guys print that again?
[00:28:04.591 --> 00:28:17.857]  Last week, the new head of the TSA, being approved right now in Congress, gave a video speech and said, our number one threat is Christians, and people that have a Christian identity, and that's the main threat.
[00:28:17.957 --> 00:28:28.022]  I mean, these guys, Paul Watson, why do you think they're now coming right out in the open and saying, we want to ban speech, we want to infiltrate you, we want to arrest you?
[00:28:28.322 --> 00:28:29.303]  I mean, this is
[00:28:30.223 --> 00:28:47.627]  They're doing it because they've become painfully aware of the fact that the sleeping giant of the American people and the rest of the world is slowly awakening to their tyranny.
[00:28:48.101 --> 00:28:49.943]  I mean, that's what he says on page three.
[00:28:50.263 --> 00:28:51.124]  Yeah, go back to that.
[00:28:51.144 --> 00:28:52.365]  The break interrupted you.
[00:28:52.405 --> 00:28:53.505]  Spend some time on that.
[00:28:53.826 --> 00:29:03.073]  He says, just like three years ago, they had that congressional meeting on extremists and showed mainline 9-11 truth groups and said these are terrorists.
[00:29:04.054 --> 00:29:14.302]  Yeah, and there was that 2006 White House directive under Bush which said that conspiracy theories were a wellspring of terrorism and that they had to be defeated.
[00:29:14.402 --> 00:29:16.064]  So, this goes back to Bush.
[00:29:16.084 --> 00:29:17.485]  It's not just an Obama thing.
[00:29:18.402 --> 00:29:33.130]  And on page three of this white paper, Sunstein says, the existence of both domestic and foreign conspiracy theories, we suggest, is no trivial matter, posing real risks to the government's anti-terrorism policies, whatever the latter may be.
[00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:41.034]  So there he's saying that the people are slowly awakening to the agenda of the military-industrial complex, and it's becoming a problem for them.
[00:29:42.154 --> 00:29:46.817]  Now what's interesting about his solution to it, later on he admits that
[00:29:47.944 --> 00:29:59.808]  In a repressive society, more conspiracy theories emerge, which is true, because governments lie and oppress people, and the people become more suspicious of government.
[00:30:00.328 --> 00:30:05.570]  And bearing in mind, conspiracy theory means disagreeing with the government on any fact whatsoever.
[00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:07.170]  That's basically how it's defined.
[00:30:08.111 --> 00:30:15.193]  So he says that repressive societies produce conspiracy theories, but then he says, just ban free speech as a solution.
[00:30:16.047 --> 00:30:30.514]  On page 20 he says, we could imagine circumstances in which a conspiracy theory became so pervasive and so dangerous, which in their eyes is what 9-11 truth was becoming a few years ago, that censorship would be thinkable.
[00:30:31.215 --> 00:30:33.696]  So again, he's saying fan free speech.
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:38.005]  As I said before, page 14, he said, ban conspiracy theories.
[00:30:52.402 --> 00:30:53.924]  Anti-global warming groups.
[00:30:53.944 --> 00:30:58.347]  They're saying the terror threat is the anti-global warming groups.
[00:30:58.728 --> 00:30:59.769]  Totally peaceful.
[00:31:00.109 --> 00:31:03.051]  And you have Europe openly calling for banning them.
[00:31:03.071 --> 00:31:09.337]  The London Guardian saying, charge Lord Monckton with treason and execute him.
[00:31:11.338 --> 00:31:16.303]  Exactly, and that's another one of the conspiracy theories listed in this report.
[00:31:16.323 --> 00:31:18.465]  It's on page 4 along with
[00:31:19.642 --> 00:31:28.109]  The conspiracy theory that powerful people were involved in the assassination of JFK, which about 90% of the American people now fully believe.
[00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:35.695]  So these people don't even realize, or their chutzpah doesn't allow them to recognize the fact that they're now the minority.
[00:31:36.096 --> 00:31:40.219]  But it also lists global warming as a deliberate fraud.
[00:31:40.259 --> 00:31:47.045]  That's also a conspiracy theory questioning global warming, which has proven to be a complete fraud in light of Climategate.
[00:31:48.055 --> 00:31:59.845]  So all along the line he's saying basically that any dissension against the prevailing authority of government and whatever they say is a conspiracy theory and should be countered.
[00:32:00.426 --> 00:32:02.728]  Now Paul, I want this to sink in for people.
[00:32:03.717 --> 00:32:08.181]  Congressional reports, Bush, Obama, everyone he's appointing.
[00:32:08.782 --> 00:32:12.245]  His own Cyber Security Chief quits and says this is a Pentagon takeover.
[00:32:12.265 --> 00:32:13.426]  They're spying on everything.
[00:32:13.726 --> 00:32:15.168]  This is all illegal.
[00:32:15.568 --> 00:32:16.709]  They just don't care.
[00:32:16.849 --> 00:32:22.194]  And now they're saying arrest people who don't believe in man-made global warming.
[00:32:23.015 --> 00:32:26.218]  And the head of the new TSA says, that's the threat.
[00:32:26.598 --> 00:32:29.441]  I mean, these people are outrageous villains!
[00:32:29.621 --> 00:32:32.184]  I mean, it's, they know they're villains.
[00:32:32.244 --> 00:32:41.633]  They know, I mean, this, the new head that Obama's trying to put in here, and I want to show a screenshot of him here from the document cam.
[00:32:43.021 --> 00:32:54.605]  I mean, it is so incredible to have Cass R. Sunstein openly writing this and now in the executive czar position over information with billions of dollars at his fingertips.
[00:32:55.985 --> 00:33:01.007]  Again, he's openly calling for infiltrating, in his words, peaceful groups.
[00:33:02.469 --> 00:33:10.838]  And getting them to engage in violence or talking about violence to run off peaceful members and so they can then entrap and imprison the other people.
[00:33:10.978 --> 00:33:15.903]  I mean, this is so dangerous that they're in the open saying it.
[00:33:16.184 --> 00:33:16.904]  We know it's all...
[00:33:17.705 --> 00:33:20.867]  And then you read over what he calls for in the 29-page document.
[00:33:21.307 --> 00:33:25.170]  It's everything in COINTELPRO from the 70s, and more!
[00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:38.978]  I mean, this is a blueprint to carry out these crimes and a reign of terror, and he's saying, ban free speech and start arresting people outright if they criticize the government in any way!
[00:33:39.078 --> 00:33:41.800]  I mean, it's so outrageous, Paul!
[00:33:42.841 --> 00:33:46.683]  As well as attacks on political opinions that the government disagrees with.
[00:33:47.907 --> 00:33:54.771]  And yeah, then you've got this other Obama appointee, Errol Stuthers, who is trying to get to head up the TSA.
[00:33:55.051 --> 00:33:58.012]  That's being resisted, but it could go through.
[00:33:58.032 --> 00:34:08.918]  And we did an article on this on Monday in which he said that people who are anti-government, or even anti-abortion, if you disagree with abortion, then you're a threat.
[00:34:09.678 --> 00:34:14.761]  And he says that people who have those opinions should be treated as the main terrorist threat.
[00:34:15.253 --> 00:34:32.059]  Which is exactly what's happening in airports when we think of people like the Ron Paul treasurer who was carrying some campaign money and some Ron Paul political material and he was arrested and interrogated for an hour simply because he was carrying this political material.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:41.783]  So they're identifying their political enemies who are the main threat to their agenda, to their tyranny, and that is libertarians and conservatives and basically anyone.
[00:34:45.054 --> 00:34:47.575]  They are actual Stalinists!
[00:34:47.695 --> 00:34:53.438]  I mean, there is no doubt that they're saying they want to take over and arrest us.
[00:34:53.538 --> 00:34:56.380]  I mean, these are outrageous criminals!
[00:34:57.641 --> 00:34:59.021]  It is outrageous!
[00:34:59.222 --> 00:35:02.824]  I mean, it is just... They've stolen $28 trillion publicly.
[00:35:03.224 --> 00:35:04.785]  They're openly engaged in fraud.
[00:35:04.805 --> 00:35:05.865]  They're robbing everything.
[00:35:05.885 --> 00:35:10.268]  Their health care bill raises taxes, cuts benefits, is a giant rip-off.
[00:35:10.768 --> 00:35:18.394]  They're just running around putting surveillance in, naked body scanners in the courthouses, biometrically scanning everyone.
[00:35:18.494 --> 00:35:21.637]  I mean, there is no doubt, Paul, this is a bona fide tyranny.
[00:35:23.418 --> 00:35:27.161]  And it's not as if this was just some idea that he was proposing.
[00:35:27.201 --> 00:35:28.903]  This has been going on for years.
[00:35:29.123 --> 00:35:39.431]  It's admitted that CENTCOM has been employing people to go into chat rooms, social networking forums, and engage bloggers who they say post
[00:35:40.367 --> 00:35:43.968]  Incomplete or false information about the war on terror.
[00:35:44.529 --> 00:35:57.734]  Then the Pentagon in 2008 said they were expanding similar operations and setting up fake news websites that were designed to look like independent media, but instead would carry military propaganda.
[00:35:58.194 --> 00:36:04.496]  You know, Israel has admitted that they've got an army of bloggers to act as apologists for Israel's war crimes.
[00:36:05.116 --> 00:36:08.177]  And the US Air Force announced that they had a similar program as well.
[00:36:08.718 --> 00:36:09.138]  And those
[00:36:10.097 --> 00:36:10.837]  Now here's the good news.
[00:36:29.517 --> 00:36:52.055]  The Village Voice, Raw Story, The Rag Blog, Got Fascism, Obama Advisor Promotes Cognitive Infiltration, Your Government Appointees at Work, Cass Sunstein Seeks Cognitive Provocateurs, then they quote him from the document, We suggest a distinctive tactic for breaking up the hardcore extremists who supply conspiracy theories.
[00:36:52.696 --> 00:36:57.519]  Cognitive infiltration of extremist groups whereby government agents or their allies
[00:36:58.712 --> 00:37:21.947]  Acting either virtually on the internet or in real space and either openly or anonymously will undermine the crippled system of believers by planting doubts about the theories and stylized facts that circulate with such groups, thereby introducing beneficial cognitive diversity.
[00:37:22.367 --> 00:37:23.488]  And so what he's saying is
[00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:25.571]  We're good to go.
[00:37:43.607 --> 00:37:52.110]  Real groups that are exposing the power structure, we go out and pose as conspiracy theorists, and that's what COINTELPRO says.
[00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:55.131]  Oh, say they're making money to make people jealous.
[00:37:55.611 --> 00:37:57.952]  Say that they're working for the government.
[00:37:58.112 --> 00:38:00.113]  And just get all this infighting going on.
[00:38:00.153 --> 00:38:03.854]  But the good news is, the left is waking up, the right's waking up.
[00:38:04.434 --> 00:38:10.617]  Now they may be attacking our sides, but when you look at a big raw story or something, every comment is, arrest the bankers.
[00:38:11.018 --> 00:38:17.041]  Every comment, I mean almost every comment, in some articles it is every comment, the bankers are bad, they control both parties.
[00:38:17.621 --> 00:38:22.264]  On the raw story, they're like, oh my god, Obama's so bad, they own them all, what do we do?
[00:38:22.644 --> 00:38:24.305]  Finally, it's all shattering.
[00:38:24.665 --> 00:38:28.988]  And so, they may have tens of thousands of hired people out doing this.
[00:38:29.548 --> 00:38:34.851]  But so many people are standing up and getting involved that it's not working anymore.
[00:38:35.151 --> 00:38:47.379]  I mean, that's really the good news here now, is that their own left, that was the victims of this in the 50s, 60s and 70s, are now realizing just how evil this is and just how bankrupt the system is.
[00:38:47.419 --> 00:38:50.100]  So the good news is, this isn't working, Paul.
[00:38:51.881 --> 00:38:52.562]  No, it's not.
[00:38:52.582 --> 00:38:56.324]  It only goes to show... I mean, people are always saying, what can we do?
[00:38:56.424 --> 00:38:56.985]  What can we do?
[00:38:57.025 --> 00:38:57.645]  We're powerless.
[00:38:58.686 --> 00:39:06.093]  Well, it can't be powerless if these people are writing 30-page dossiers about how they're terrified of the impact we're having on society.
[00:39:06.854 --> 00:39:19.407]  And what's ironic about it is, if you go to my article about it today, the very first comment is an example of one of these people at work, and then, you know, the rest of the commenters on the page have fun with it.
[00:39:19.887 --> 00:39:21.489]  Because, instantly,
[00:39:22.284 --> 00:39:22.964]  The moronic.
[00:39:23.504 --> 00:39:24.085]  That's right.
[00:39:24.365 --> 00:39:35.049]  The second we post it, and before they would try the Alex is a Fed, Alex is doing this, Alex is doing that, all the same stuff they did to breakup groups in the 60s, that doesn't work anymore.
[00:39:35.289 --> 00:39:39.191]  Now they try saying first, like I posted first to control the debate.
[00:39:39.471 --> 00:39:45.873]  Or they try to put nonsensical stuff, or they talk about Palladians and aliens, and we can go in and look at the IP addresses.
[00:39:46.113 --> 00:39:49.775]  They're using proxy server blockers, they're using virtual browsers.
[00:39:50.755 --> 00:39:58.819]  And, but it's the same IP addresses, and they'll have fake debates with each other, which he talks about, creating fake false contexts.
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:03.722]  Again, they talk about being mapmakers of the mind, setting the narrative.
[00:40:05.123 --> 00:40:13.372]  Again, controlling the confines of the debate, turning us all against each other, radicalizing us so we're not palatable mainstream.
[00:40:13.772 --> 00:40:17.156]  I mean, it feels so good to be under mega attack by these people.
[00:40:17.416 --> 00:40:22.582]  Paul, no one on the web is attacked more than Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:40:22.822 --> 00:40:26.103]  Exactly, and their tactics are increasingly getting more and more ludicrous.
[00:40:26.123 --> 00:40:27.204]  One of my favorites is
[00:40:50.014 --> 00:40:53.656]  They'll go into an article and they'll just say, this is a fake news story.
[00:40:53.676 --> 00:41:04.960]  For example, I posted a New York Times story, you know, a few paragraphs from it with a link to the original where you can read it at the New York Times about an eight-year-old boy being on a terror watch list.
[00:41:05.561 --> 00:41:08.862]  And one of the comments says, this seems like a fake news story.
[00:41:09.594 --> 00:41:11.975]  And that's one of the tactics they use as well.
[00:41:12.035 --> 00:41:12.715]  It's ad homage.
[00:41:12.935 --> 00:41:13.436]  Exactly.
[00:41:13.536 --> 00:41:20.759]  On YouTube, the same accounts set up the same ways will comment when we play a Herman Van Rompuy clip, head of the EU calling for global government.
[00:41:21.359 --> 00:41:25.541]  I'll see the same person on hundreds of our videos working full time.
[00:41:25.981 --> 00:41:27.161]  Always the first comment.
[00:41:27.201 --> 00:41:27.882]  They're waiting.
[00:41:27.922 --> 00:41:28.742]  They're watching.
[00:41:29.122 --> 00:41:30.463]  And that's what COINTELPRO was all about.
[00:41:30.523 --> 00:41:33.645]  It was about neutralizing people so they felt powerless and eventually
[00:41:57.799 --> 00:42:02.100]  You know, stirring up apathy so people would just disengage altogether.
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:13.002]  That's what he's talking about in this dossier about infiltrating conspiracy groups and promoting counter misinformation, as he describes it.
[00:42:13.682 --> 00:42:20.284]  So he's savaging people for putting out conspiracies that aren't true, like, you know, sunlight being good for you.
[00:42:21.164 --> 00:42:23.724]  But then he says that when the government does it, it's fine.
[00:42:24.464 --> 00:42:26.745]  And they can ban our free speech to go along with it.
[00:42:28.493 --> 00:42:30.014]  Well, Paul, thanks for the great report.
[00:42:30.034 --> 00:42:37.499]  We need more reports on the aspect of him saying we're going to ban free speech and tax newspapers or anybody that criticizes government.
[00:42:37.859 --> 00:42:42.502]  And he sets the precedent at, I say sunlight isn't good for you.
[00:42:42.983 --> 00:42:45.765]  And if you don't agree, you need to be banned or arrested.
[00:42:46.065 --> 00:42:55.591]  He picks something asinine to kind of put people off psychologically so they can set the precedent to ban anything they want, including 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:42:56.171 --> 00:42:56.372]  Nope.
[00:42:56.652 --> 00:42:57.933]  Sunstein says it equals 5.
[00:43:00.814 --> 00:43:07.998]  For the first time ever, the makers of Alpine Air Foods have approved an incredible sale with savings only available through ready-made resources.

[00:44:01.224 --> 00:44:04.873]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:44:05.254 --> 00:44:08.261]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:44:08.501 --> 00:44:09.904]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:44:10.623 --> 00:44:13.266]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:44:13.286 --> 00:44:19.532]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:44:19.692 --> 00:44:24.716]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:44:24.877 --> 00:44:28.020]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:34.866]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:44:34.986 --> 00:44:37.086]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:44:37.327 --> 00:44:38.647]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:44:38.907 --> 00:44:41.187]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:44:41.367 --> 00:44:43.228]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:44:43.488 --> 00:44:48.309]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:44:48.629 --> 00:44:58.571]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:45:00.311 --> 00:45:03.012]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:45:04.713 --> 00:45:07.295]  Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:45:07.575 --> 00:45:11.037]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:45:11.317 --> 00:45:18.342]  At less than two cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride,
[00:45:20.308 --> 00:45:28.210]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems from the smallest to the largest systems.

[00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:59.542]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today.
[00:46:02.663 --> 00:46:05.044]  Okay, folks, we are back live here.
[00:46:05.065 --> 00:46:08.906]  I'm going to continue into the next hour for another 20 minutes or so on COINTELPRO.
[00:46:08.926 --> 00:46:11.108]  I'm going to get into some facets we haven't covered.
[00:46:11.488 --> 00:46:14.129]  But here's Alexa.com, a service of Amazon.
[00:46:14.149 --> 00:46:16.710]  This is just one of the major rating services.
[00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:17.571]  It's the biggest.
[00:46:18.444 --> 00:46:20.644]  This is what the media most often refers to.
[00:46:21.185 --> 00:46:29.946]  In the last seven days, look at InfoWars.com in blue versus Rush Limbaugh in red and Glenn Beck in gold.
[00:46:31.127 --> 00:46:33.127]  Now that's InfoWars.com.
[00:46:34.307 --> 00:46:36.348]  That's InfoWars.com in blue.
[00:46:37.188 --> 00:46:39.969]  Up 43, 46% growth in the last three months.
[00:46:39.989 --> 00:46:42.369]  A 7% growth in the last month.
[00:46:47.819 --> 00:46:49.281]  And we're even having a down week.
[00:46:49.301 --> 00:46:51.223]  We're down 7% in the last week.
[00:46:52.324 --> 00:46:57.590]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, that's our growth curve compared to RushLimbaugh.com.
[00:46:57.610 --> 00:47:00.573]  In fact, add PrisonPlanet.com in there on the box.
[00:47:01.727 --> 00:47:03.389]  Let's put Prison Planet on the screen.
[00:47:03.869 --> 00:47:07.393]  It's bigger than Limbaugh and Beck most weeks.
[00:47:07.413 --> 00:47:08.434]  I don't know about this week.
[00:47:09.034 --> 00:47:13.519]  But Infowars overall completely dominates and dwarfs them.
[00:47:13.919 --> 00:47:16.502]  Now, we are the number one target of COINTELPRO.
[00:47:16.522 --> 00:47:18.123]  That's why they throw everything at us.
[00:47:18.604 --> 00:47:19.805]  They say I'm a reptoid.
[00:47:19.845 --> 00:47:21.247]  They say I'm a Jewish agent.
[00:47:21.287 --> 00:47:23.349]  They say I work for the Vatican when I'm a Protestant.
[00:47:24.209 --> 00:47:25.490]  They say I'm a murderer.
[00:47:25.550 --> 00:47:27.311]  They say I work for the Saudi Arabians.
[00:47:27.612 --> 00:47:29.073]  They say I work for the Brothmans.
[00:47:29.093 --> 00:47:30.534]  They say I'm a Scientologist.
[00:47:31.094 --> 00:47:35.057]  All complete and absolute fabricated lies.
[00:47:35.497 --> 00:47:49.187]  But they're so elaborate and some people see it and it's just meant to distract you from going out and reaching other people, waking other people up, and to make most of our activities about debating Alex Jones.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:55.724]  Now it's great for Alex Jones and overall visitors and web numbers, but it's not good for the overall movement.
[00:47:56.385 --> 00:47:58.426]  Did you get that PrisonPlanet.com entered in?
[00:47:58.667 --> 00:48:01.409]  There's PrisonPlanet.com in turquoise.
[00:48:02.289 --> 00:48:07.453]  PrisonPlanet.com, again, bigger than Rush Limbaugh, bigger than Glenn Beck.
[00:48:09.374 --> 00:48:14.158]  Now, I have the number one and number two alternative websites.
[00:48:14.718 --> 00:48:16.980]  InfoWars is rated 998 in the United States.
[00:48:22.236 --> 00:48:24.718]  998.
[00:48:23.297 --> 00:48:24.718]  Show people Drudge Report now.
[00:48:24.758 --> 00:48:25.998]  They want to see something really big.
[00:48:26.518 --> 00:48:29.600]  Drudge is the biggest news site in the world.
[00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:31.421]  Let's see.
[00:48:31.841 --> 00:48:33.882]  Drudge will dwarf Limbaugh, myself, and everybody.
[00:48:34.162 --> 00:48:35.743]  But let's see how we're gaining.
[00:48:36.943 --> 00:48:38.884]  Put Drudge Report in there finally.
[00:48:39.665 --> 00:48:40.905]  And see their U.S.
[00:48:40.985 --> 00:48:41.706]  and world rating.
[00:48:42.246 --> 00:48:44.347]  So that's why Drudge is now linked to us permanently.
[00:48:46.058 --> 00:48:48.239]  Look at Drudge, now that is mega power.
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:53.703]  Look at Infowars, way down there, and way below us, Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck.
[00:48:54.123 --> 00:48:56.805]  Now that is internet power right there.
[00:48:57.245 --> 00:48:59.006]  And what do you see on the Drudge Report every day now?
[00:48:59.266 --> 00:49:00.447]  World government is here!
[00:49:00.727 --> 00:49:01.848]  World government announced!
[00:49:02.188 --> 00:49:17.512]  They aren't, Drudge isn't listening to the map makers of the mind, the people that set the narrative, set the paradigm, like this Sunstein, this Cass Sunstein at the White House, who says, there is no global government, and if you say it, you should be arrested.
[00:49:17.832 --> 00:49:18.712]  He actually says that.
[00:49:20.493 --> 00:49:29.435]  Well, Drudge goes, okay, I'll go ahead and link to the head of the UN, the head of the EU, Gordon Brown, Al Gore, all of them calling for world government.
[00:49:31.092 --> 00:49:32.753]  Limbaugh won't do that yet.
[00:49:32.953 --> 00:49:33.614]  Beck is.
[00:49:34.994 --> 00:49:41.378]  So, I mean, it's taken all these years just to admit and to say, no, FBI, no, Sunstein, no!
[00:49:42.018 --> 00:49:46.821]  When Herman Von Ruppe calls for global government and global taxes, I will report on it.
[00:49:47.562 --> 00:49:51.864]  I know I gotta worry about you getting people hired in my office to commit crimes to send me to prison.
[00:49:52.325 --> 00:49:57.728]  I know I gotta worry about these different government groups trying to get white supremacist nut jobs to kill me.
[00:49:58.228 --> 00:50:02.350]  But I will go on air and I will play the clip of the head of the EU.
[00:50:02.711 --> 00:50:04.592]  I don't care if you say it doesn't exist.
[00:50:04.852 --> 00:50:06.493]  I don't care if you say it isn't real.
[00:50:06.753 --> 00:50:08.334]  I don't care if you say I'm a kook.
[00:50:08.814 --> 00:50:09.594]  I know the truth.
[00:50:09.875 --> 00:50:10.715]  I know what's real.
[00:50:10.855 --> 00:50:11.776]  I know I'm good.
[00:50:12.196 --> 00:50:13.216]  I know I'm for real.
[00:50:13.337 --> 00:50:14.657]  I know I love this country.
[00:50:15.158 --> 00:50:16.718]  And I know the banks are robbing us.
[00:50:16.979 --> 00:50:20.741]  And I'm standing up against you and your tens of thousands of hired thugs.
[00:50:21.601 --> 00:50:23.362]  And the people are going to stand up with us.
[00:50:23.682 --> 00:50:24.603]  And you can feel it.
[00:50:24.803 --> 00:50:26.024]  And you better be scared.
[00:50:26.988 --> 00:50:30.512]  Because you can't stand up against somebody who's in the right that keeps on a-comin'.
[00:50:31.212 --> 00:50:33.915]  And you know I'm gonna keep on a-comin' no matter what you do!
[00:50:34.556 --> 00:50:36.538]  You understand that, you little criminal?
[00:50:36.738 --> 00:50:39.441]  You slimebag, anti-American TRASH!

[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:57.882]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:52:14.392 --> 00:52:18.893]  I know callers have been patiently holding, and I'll start going to your calls at 20 after.
[00:52:18.913 --> 00:52:20.713]  I want to finish up on COINTELPRO.
[00:52:20.733 --> 00:52:26.774]  I know a lot of you called in before I got into COINTELPRO, but I'd like to get your take on what I've been covering.
[00:52:27.834 --> 00:52:41.197]  The White House head of information technology integrating with the cybersecurity czar, the former head quit saying it's a total takeover of free speech, he is calling in a Harvard slash
[00:52:42.239 --> 00:52:54.344]  University of Chicago Law School report for banning all free speech in America, and he says that the government says sunlight's bad, anyone that says it's good, arrested.
[00:52:54.825 --> 00:53:04.649]  He actually says that we are the complete arbiters, 2 plus 2 equals 5, you don't agree with this guy, jail time.
[00:53:05.942 --> 00:53:16.110]  And if he can't get you that way, he says, go into these peaceful groups, call for violence to run off all the smart people, hopefully we can set somebody up and get them some prison time!
[00:53:16.951 --> 00:53:18.732]  I mean, this is bold!
[00:53:19.833 --> 00:53:20.734]  This is chutzpah!
[00:53:22.876 --> 00:53:26.158]  This is mega, mega, mega bold.
[00:53:26.239 --> 00:53:28.440]  Oh, it's all been going on for decades.
[00:53:29.681 --> 00:53:32.484]  Much of it declassified, but to have them openly,
[00:53:33.385 --> 00:53:37.789]  Imagine if I came out and said, let's arrest anybody that doesn't agree with anything the government says.
[00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:41.934]  Let's arrest and ban and tax anybody that doesn't agree with us.
[00:53:42.254 --> 00:53:45.818]  Let's hire fake bloggers everywhere to put out lies about people.
[00:53:46.158 --> 00:53:51.944]  Let's infiltrate people's operations and political groups and let's screw them up and ruin them!
[00:53:51.964 --> 00:53:52.764]  We're the government!
[00:53:52.845 --> 00:53:53.465]  We're the criminal!
[00:53:53.505 --> 00:53:54.666]  I mean, it's just so criminal!
[00:53:55.307 --> 00:53:56.829]  Just rabidly in your face!
[00:53:58.490 --> 00:54:00.011]  They're trying to make you capitulate.
[00:54:00.031 --> 00:54:01.231]  They're trying to break your back.
[00:54:01.491 --> 00:54:03.412]  But he says in the report, he says, we're scared.
[00:54:03.632 --> 00:54:04.413]  They're taking over.
[00:54:05.173 --> 00:54:06.133]  No one believes us.
[00:54:06.774 --> 00:54:10.855]  We've got to pose as conspiracy theorists to discredit everyone.
[00:54:12.036 --> 00:54:17.538]  We've got to put out ridiculous conspiracy theories and attack the real leadership, the real people.
[00:54:18.018 --> 00:54:19.119]  I'm the real thing!
[00:54:19.419 --> 00:54:21.080]  Do you have any discernment out there?
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:22.020]  Yes, most of you do.
[00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:24.081]  Who has fought for 14 years?
[00:54:24.101 --> 00:54:25.842]  When you talk to most people, who woke them up?
[00:54:26.650 --> 00:54:35.838]  When you talk to most people shattering the left-right paradigm, the left waking up to Obama, they will tell you, PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.com, Obama deception.
[00:54:36.359 --> 00:54:37.320]  I have studied history.
[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:38.701]  I know how to beat these people.
[00:54:39.702 --> 00:54:45.347]  I'm just average intelligence, but I've studied history, and I'm willing to take on tyranny, folks.
[00:54:46.348 --> 00:54:46.668]  Okay?
[00:54:46.708 --> 00:54:49.030]  Because it's not because I have courage.
[00:54:50.592 --> 00:54:52.954]  I have survival instinct.
[00:54:54.761 --> 00:54:55.681]  Survival instinct.
[00:54:55.741 --> 00:55:02.682]  I mean, I know there's a lot of people that when some mugger comes up to them with a knife or a gun, and says, give me your money, they crap their pants and give it up.
[00:55:02.982 --> 00:55:04.303]  I can't control myself.
[00:55:04.443 --> 00:55:12.204]  I got attempted mugged a few times growing up in Dallas, and I just instantly acted like I was going to go along with them, and then beat the living daylights out of them.
[00:55:12.904 --> 00:55:13.824]  I mean, I can't help it.
[00:55:13.864 --> 00:55:17.285]  When somebody tries to attack me, I go after them.
[00:55:17.785 --> 00:55:19.405]  And that's how men always were.
[00:55:20.026 --> 00:55:22.106]  A hundred years ago, I'd just be an average person.
[00:55:24.724 --> 00:55:26.428]  Today I'm some kind of freak!
[00:55:28.035 --> 00:55:36.321]  What, some guy running the White House operation says arrest everybody that disagrees with anything the government says?
[00:55:37.082 --> 00:55:38.183]  I'm the bad man?
[00:55:39.063 --> 00:55:39.284]  No.
[00:55:39.444 --> 00:55:40.284]  People are waking up.
[00:55:40.324 --> 00:55:41.165]  They've gone too far.
[00:55:41.766 --> 00:55:46.309]  They're going, the White House says there's no global government, but Obama called for it?
[00:55:47.170 --> 00:55:49.592]  The White House says, don't worry, they don't want our guns.
[00:55:49.912 --> 00:55:53.935]  They've just introduced 15 bills that basically ban the Second Amendment.
[00:55:53.955 --> 00:55:55.536]  I mean, I got the bill right here.
[00:55:55.936 --> 00:55:57.598]  Why are you telling me it doesn't exist?
[00:56:01.443 --> 00:56:05.327]  It doesn't work anymore, you little spineless creature!
[00:56:07.129 --> 00:56:09.531]  It doesn't work anymore!
[00:56:09.611 --> 00:56:11.473]  We're not your property!
[00:56:11.813 --> 00:56:13.675]  We're not owned by you!
[00:56:14.255 --> 00:56:16.818]  You don't tell us what to think anymore!
[00:56:17.318 --> 00:56:19.080]  Your spell is broken!
[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:22.884]  Your game of lies and fraud is over!
[00:56:24.181 --> 00:56:25.623]  Millions of people are awake.
[00:56:25.763 --> 00:56:27.885]  Millions more are awakening every month.
[00:56:28.385 --> 00:56:29.747]  And they're setting their jaw.
[00:56:30.207 --> 00:56:31.489]  They're baring their teeth.
[00:56:32.169 --> 00:56:33.911]  They're turning their souls on.
[00:56:34.272 --> 00:56:36.153]  The giant forges of liberty.
[00:56:36.734 --> 00:56:40.198]  The giant is energizing and rising!
[00:56:41.493 --> 00:56:44.717]  And there's a lot of us out here that don't care what you do to us in the end.
[00:56:44.817 --> 00:56:46.840]  All that matters is that you go down.
[00:56:47.641 --> 00:56:50.404]  All that matters is that you are defeated.
[00:56:50.785 --> 00:56:52.707]  And it's that spirit you're afraid of.
[00:56:53.188 --> 00:56:55.010]  You're afraid of that spirit, aren't you?
[00:56:55.591 --> 00:56:57.693]  The spirit of victory and freedom!
[00:56:58.655 --> 00:56:59.856]  Stopping you, the parasite!
[00:57:16.974 --> 00:57:19.356]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[00:57:59.315 --> 00:58:03.537]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:03.857 --> 00:58:04.478]  Number one.
[00:58:04.778 --> 00:58:07.939]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:08.199 --> 00:58:08.760]  Number two.
[00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:13.602]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:58:13.942 --> 00:58:14.403]  It's true.
[00:58:14.683 --> 00:58:19.245]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:58:19.545 --> 00:58:20.106]  Number 3.
[00:58:20.386 --> 00:58:23.669]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:58:23.969 --> 00:58:27.713]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:58:27.893 --> 00:58:28.433]  Number 4.
[00:58:28.674 --> 00:58:31.056]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:58:31.436 --> 00:58:34.839]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:35.340]  Number 5.
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:39.844]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:58:40.064 --> 00:58:44.829]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:58:45.089 --> 00:58:49.134]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:58:49.274 --> 00:58:50.836]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:58:51.056 --> 00:58:53.158]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:58:53.319 --> 00:58:55.661]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:59:00.529 --> 00:59:04.534]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[00:59:04.814 --> 00:59:07.677]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[00:59:08.098 --> 00:59:14.725]  Our God-given right to life and liberty, and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health, are in jeopardy.
[00:59:15.085 --> 00:59:19.991]  If we the people do not diligently assert these rights, they may be taken away and lost forever.
[00:59:19.991 --> 00:59:20.331]  Forever.
[00:59:20.751 --> 00:59:27.194]  Utopia Silver is known for fighting for health freedom, and we will not meekly allow ourselves to be led as lambs to the slaughter.
[00:59:27.554 --> 00:59:33.356]  Sitting passively by and accepting the chains of slavery that are being placed on America is not an option.
[00:59:33.757 --> 00:59:35.977]  Please stand with Utopia Silver in this fight.
[00:59:36.338 --> 00:59:43.741]  Utopia Silver carries some of the most effective colloidal silver products on the market, and numerous other high-quality health supplements.
[00:59:44.101 --> 00:59:45.982]  Visit us today at utopiasilver.com.
[00:59:47.182 --> 00:59:48.743]  We're good to go.
[01:00:13.621 --> 01:00:19.083]  When we get FEMA training documents and FEMA training videos of local police, and I've released these.
[01:00:19.843 --> 01:00:20.643]  This is on record.
[01:00:21.884 --> 01:00:25.145]  And the COINTELPRO goes into those YouTube videos and says this isn't real.
[01:00:25.845 --> 01:00:28.526]  They said my MIAC and Homeland Security report wasn't real.
[01:00:28.866 --> 01:00:39.730]  They said my secret documents that we released about how we were really at a level 6 flu pandemic, that the UN had already announced it internally, they still say that isn't real, even though it was later admitted that I was right.
[01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:50.431]  Again, they know this is a real source of info that actually reads their documents for coming up on two decades, been on air over 14 years, been studying for 16, 17 years.
[01:00:50.892 --> 01:00:53.275]  They know that I actually have their number.
[01:00:54.653 --> 01:00:57.876]  You know, these guys studied two, three years to get their Ph.D.
[01:00:58.557 --> 01:01:00.038]  in propaganda and lies.
[01:01:00.499 --> 01:01:03.221]  I have an organic, super Ph.D.
[01:01:03.261 --> 01:01:04.662]  in how these criminals operate.
[01:01:05.083 --> 01:01:09.327]  I mean, I study them day in, day out with passion to know how they operate.
[01:01:09.747 --> 01:01:16.454]  And to watch a lot of you out there that aren't as sophisticated, who are just as smart as I am, or smarter, but who haven't done the research,
[01:01:17.054 --> 01:01:20.996]  They know you're waking up in droves, and they want to turn you against other patriot movements.
[01:01:21.276 --> 01:01:25.078]  They want to confuse you, confound you, demonize the real leadership.
[01:01:25.518 --> 01:01:34.803]  When you see them demonizing people like Ron Paul, myself, and others, you know it is a COINTELPRO operation.
[01:01:35.243 --> 01:01:39.085]  Some of it's jealousy, but that's mainly repeaters, mockingbirds.
[01:01:40.117 --> 01:01:47.623]  That's why the CIA called their media operation Mockingbird in the 40s, 50s, 60s, and 70s that got declassified in the church committee and others.
[01:01:48.663 --> 01:02:01.333]  It's called Mockingbird because they have key people in the media, and back then it wasn't even that many, just a few thousand, who then would put out this info and then there were repeaters who would Mockingbird it.
[01:02:01.993 --> 01:02:03.795]  And that's how they get the snowball going.
[01:02:05.057 --> 01:02:17.590]  It isn't even so much meant to hurt Alex Jones as to hurt you and your intellectual development and to keep you from ever becoming actually informed or effective, kind of falling into the whole issue of no significance.
[01:02:18.544 --> 01:02:31.749]  soap opera of, is it the Octarians, or is it the Green Aliens, or is it the Jews, or is it the Catholics, or is it, you know, the Merovingians, or is it the Bagaboogians?
[01:02:31.789 --> 01:02:34.510]  You know, it just goes on and on and on.
[01:02:34.830 --> 01:02:39.952]  And sure, of the real groups I named, every major power structure, they've infiltrated and taken it over.
[01:02:40.552 --> 01:02:53.005]  So all the Vatican's calling for world government, a lot of the people in Israel's government is calling for world government, Europe's calling for world government, Mexico's calling for world government, because they're all owned by the same big banks.
[01:02:54.666 --> 01:03:00.192]  And so they can, again, divide and conquer by making any movement against tyranny issue specific.
[01:03:01.727 --> 01:03:04.248]  So they can then divide people off against groups.
[01:03:04.908 --> 01:03:08.110]  Look, different religions and races of people, we can all kill each other later.
[01:03:09.030 --> 01:03:11.891]  But right now, we're trying to beat the New World Order.
[01:03:12.211 --> 01:03:16.513]  That's the big scientific dictatorship that uses human psychology against us.
[01:03:17.173 --> 01:03:21.275]  Again, they've written literally thousands of white papers bragging how they do it.
[01:03:21.695 --> 01:03:29.298]  In the 1920s, Edward Bernays, the nephew of Sigmund Freud, top Department of War psych warfare expert.
[01:03:29.738 --> 01:03:34.280]  I mean, he's the guy that got women smoking cigarettes, bacon and eggs, everything you live under.
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:37.222]  He wrote two books bragging how they do all this to you.
[01:03:37.882 --> 01:03:39.062]  That was 80 years ago!
[01:03:40.943 --> 01:03:42.944]  On and on and on and on!
[01:03:43.404 --> 01:03:44.805]  All I'm asking you to do
[01:03:46.263 --> 01:03:53.573]  Is to think for yourself, get outside the box, and get some discernment, and then take action yourself.
[01:03:53.753 --> 01:03:55.756]  You know you are good.
[01:03:55.876 --> 01:03:58.420]  You know, listening, that you're not COINTELPRO.
[01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:00.303]  Because that's not how COINTELPRO works so well.
[01:04:01.468 --> 01:04:29.484]  Is that once they cause all the infighting and division and problems, then everyone spends their time on that, and then you can't expand your organizations, because any... Folks, I learned about COINTELPRO, I'd read about it and heard about it, but like in 96, 97, there'd be some old veteran, they were gonna bulldoze his house and take it, so we'd go over there to try to get the bulldozers to stop and help him with the community, Joe Campana, and plainclothes cops would walk on and say, ah, Alex, we need to kill some judges in Austin, we need to...
[01:04:30.509 --> 01:04:33.351]  And I'd follow him out to their car, and it'd be an unmarked police car.
[01:04:34.891 --> 01:04:40.194]  And then I found out the local cops had been hired by the local realtors that wanted to steal that guy's property.
[01:04:40.854 --> 01:04:43.576]  And it just, you're like, how do they hire people this evil?
[01:04:44.937 --> 01:04:48.438]  And so they don't... Here's another great example of COINTELPRO.
[01:04:49.579 --> 01:04:58.824]  When I was in Denver, I said there were occasions that looked like, during the DNC in 2008, a year and a half ago, I said there were occasions
[01:05:00.836 --> 01:05:04.798]  That it looked like it was police as anarchists attacking other cops.
[01:05:05.298 --> 01:05:09.320]  And eyewitnesses said, yeah, we saw white vans, because we couldn't be everywhere, there were protests going on everywhere.
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:17.063]  White vans pulled up, Marines got out in uniforms, and openly in the doors, changed into anarchist outfit.
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:19.961]  It later came out in the Denver Post.
[01:05:20.061 --> 01:05:21.222]  That was all true.
[01:05:21.242 --> 01:05:23.923]  It was all run by the Pentagon.
[01:05:24.023 --> 01:05:24.923]  They had FBI.
[01:05:24.963 --> 01:05:25.924]  They had military.
[01:05:26.184 --> 01:05:27.725]  Same thing in Seattle in 99.
[01:05:27.765 --> 01:05:29.446]  That came out in all the Seattle papers.
[01:05:29.466 --> 01:05:31.527]  It's in my film, Police Day 2, The Takeover.
[01:05:34.528 --> 01:05:39.091]  And they had police attack other police in Denver.
[01:05:39.191 --> 01:05:39.691]  Confirmed.
[01:05:40.987 --> 01:05:41.467]  Confirmed.
[01:05:41.847 --> 01:05:43.868]  They did it in Ottawa a year and a half ago.
[01:05:43.968 --> 01:05:51.890]  Royal Mountain Police got caught attacking their own police so they could then demonize the peaceful families in suits and ties and with strollers.
[01:05:52.310 --> 01:06:01.673]  Look, the globalists see a couple thousand good-looking families out there in front of the news cameras protesting the Security Prosperity Partnership North American Union.
[01:06:03.604 --> 01:06:10.727]  And they immediately had cops come up and attack their own cops so they could attack the peaceful crowds and discredit those peaceful demonstrators.
[01:06:11.207 --> 01:06:13.148]  That's an example of COINTELPRO.
[01:06:13.668 --> 01:06:16.309]  And that's what the White House technologies are.
[01:06:18.018 --> 01:06:21.900]  That's what he's calling for, the Information and Regulatory Affairs.
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:31.945]  He's calling for coming into our offices, into our operations, into our political movements, into our video and bookstore movements that are really hurting them, because we're funding ourselves.
[01:06:31.965 --> 01:06:33.646]  They don't like us getting a little bit of power.
[01:06:34.633 --> 01:06:39.937]  Because for one dollar that we get, we can do the equivalent of a million dollars of what they do with lies.
[01:06:40.658 --> 01:06:43.360]  One dollar of truth is better than a million dollars of lies.
[01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:46.182]  Lies have to be reapplied over and over again.
[01:06:46.922 --> 01:06:48.203]  They fall apart.
[01:06:48.243 --> 01:06:54.288]  The truth gets stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and builds and builds a dynamic system.
[01:06:56.078 --> 01:06:59.380]  So think about the magnitude of what they've been caught.
[01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:06.623]  And every time I go to a big city and see provocateurs, I've seen it in Austin, we've seen it at the G20 with my crew up there.
[01:07:07.223 --> 01:07:13.606]  Every time I sit there and watch the film or in person when I'm there and I go, I can't believe they got their cops to do it too.
[01:07:14.466 --> 01:07:15.927]  I want to like the cops.
[01:07:16.047 --> 01:07:17.588]  I want to think you're not criminals.
[01:07:18.088 --> 01:07:19.729]  I want to give you the benefit of the doubt.
[01:07:19.769 --> 01:07:21.229]  But I know what's going on.
[01:07:21.830 --> 01:07:24.711]  Every city has groups of criminal cops
[01:07:26.178 --> 01:07:31.782]  And it's normally special units, that's how they compartmentalize it, so the average cop hearing this goes, we don't do stuff like that!
[01:07:33.643 --> 01:07:37.286]  Who go out and do this type of stuff, and it's so wrong.
[01:07:37.946 --> 01:07:39.047]  It's so evil.
[01:07:41.749 --> 01:07:45.372]  So ladies and gentlemen, you know you're good.
[01:07:46.412 --> 01:07:47.393]  You know you're a leader.
[01:07:48.414 --> 01:07:49.315]  Start a website.
[01:07:49.415 --> 01:07:50.676]  Start doing YouTube videos.
[01:07:50.696 --> 01:07:52.057]  Start calling to talk radio.
[01:07:52.457 --> 01:07:53.858]  Start a local organization.
[01:07:55.216 --> 01:07:58.979]  You know, a military history enthusiast group.
[01:07:59.199 --> 01:08:00.280]  You want to train militarily.
[01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:02.441]  Or a land rights group.
[01:08:02.941 --> 01:08:05.163]  And I'll assure you, you want to find out about the New World Order.
[01:08:05.203 --> 01:08:06.404]  Don't be scared by this, though.
[01:08:06.904 --> 01:08:14.489]  Go with five of your buddies, say you're going to meet in two weeks at the local library, and there will be one or two vicious
[01:08:15.490 --> 01:08:22.434]  Foundation hired thugs, or FBI informants, or FBI, or Defense Intelligence there, and you'll just see them.
[01:08:22.454 --> 01:08:26.056]  They're soulless, they're slimy, they don't have a spirit of strength or honor.
[01:08:26.336 --> 01:08:30.339]  If you've got your discernment on, you'll immediately know who they are as soon as you see them.
[01:08:30.399 --> 01:08:40.685]  I mean, I have freaked these people out at events when I've been protesting, and they have a Navy SEAL or something walk behind us, and you can look at their body type, the look on their eye, the predatory stare that they're trying to hide, and I'll go,
[01:08:42.273 --> 01:08:49.899]  So you're here from Northcom, and they'll go, whatever Jones, and just kind of get on down.
[01:08:49.919 --> 01:08:52.681]  I mean, this has happened to me over and over and over again.
[01:08:52.941 --> 01:08:55.443]  And they're always amazed that you immediately know them.
[01:08:55.843 --> 01:08:56.604]  But if you sit there,
[01:08:57.557 --> 01:08:58.858]  Well, what's everybody want to talk about?
[01:08:58.898 --> 01:09:06.122]  Well, they're taking this old lady's land and this farm and there's an environmental land grab going on through the local bank and it's Agenda 21.
[01:09:06.162 --> 01:09:07.282]  I think we need to expose it.
[01:09:07.323 --> 01:09:13.926]  We need to go to City Council next week and one guy will stand up and go, I think we ought to bomb them with a neutron bomb.
[01:09:15.927 --> 01:09:23.872]  And they'll act all animated and so the normal people there won't want to be involved and if there's any fool that even jokes and goes, oh yeah, you're going to prison.
[01:09:25.333 --> 01:09:28.616]  But what you do is you have a recorder at that first meeting, and you go, oh, tell me more.
[01:09:29.317 --> 01:09:34.842]  And then you follow them out to their car, you photograph their car, and you say, I'm calling the police right now.
[01:09:37.574 --> 01:09:41.375]  Because if you just call the police without recording them, they'll say you called for the violence.
[01:09:41.855 --> 01:09:47.577]  And the cops will show up and look embarrassed, and the guy will kind of do a hand sign or whatever, and the cop will be like, what's going on here?
[01:09:47.877 --> 01:09:50.017]  And you're going to be dealing with a hardcore terrorist!
[01:09:50.057 --> 01:09:52.718]  These are government terrorists, ladies and gentlemen!
[01:09:52.978 --> 01:09:57.980]  I mean, you can't help an old man in Austin without him showing up, okay?
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:06.682]  Folks, COINTELPRO declassified, admitted that they infiltrate mainline, pro-war, pro-government churches.
[01:10:08.442 --> 01:10:15.627]  If the church is actually having real soup kitchens, they don't want anything that's community but government.
[01:10:16.467 --> 01:10:18.149]  They don't want strong communities.
[01:10:18.549 --> 01:10:24.353]  You actually try to help people with a real charity?
[01:10:25.614 --> 01:10:27.435]  They will shut you down in 10 seconds.
[01:10:27.755 --> 01:10:31.818]  But you steal every single dime of it and give political contributions?
[01:10:32.725 --> 01:10:36.307]  They'll show up at your door and say, we want to work with you robbing people.
[01:10:36.447 --> 01:10:38.528]  I mean, it's just, don't you understand?
[01:10:38.948 --> 01:10:42.290]  Millions of criminals have worked out all these fancy scams.
[01:10:42.610 --> 01:10:47.973]  They're now in control of almost everything, and they know there's a mass awakening to them right now.
[01:10:49.352 --> 01:10:59.994]  So, Homeland Security comes out in congressional testimony and says, we're just going to ban free speech in America and put taxes on alternative newspapers and infiltrate their groups and commit all these crimes.
[01:11:00.214 --> 01:11:01.134]  They're just out in the open.
[01:11:01.394 --> 01:11:09.076]  Because they have to come out in the open like it's normal to get their own spooks and their own informants and their own operatives to do it.
[01:11:13.336 --> 01:11:16.037]  So again, what does the COINTELPRO document say?
[01:11:17.875 --> 01:11:28.177]  According to FBI records, COINTELPRO resources were expended on infiltrating, disrupting, marginalizing, and or subverting groups suspected of being subversive.
[01:11:28.497 --> 01:11:37.579]  I can't tell you how many times I've just gone to any political event and somebody calls you in the back room and says, psst, hey, uh, we're going to that protest tomorrow.
[01:11:37.599 --> 01:11:38.959]  You might feel like you're under threat.
[01:11:38.999 --> 01:11:41.400]  I got a little submachine gun you can just have.
[01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:42.500]  Just take it.
[01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:43.420]  Just take it.
[01:11:47.955 --> 01:11:52.741]  And if I was dumb enough to, oh thanks for the submachine gun, oh yeah, it'd be on the news.
[01:11:52.761 --> 01:11:55.263]  Alex Jones was planning to kill with submachine gun.
[01:11:57.025 --> 01:11:58.127]  But they go further than that.
[01:12:00.697 --> 01:12:01.937]  This is an emergency alert.
[01:12:02.458 --> 01:12:04.518]  People don't die of H1N1 infection.
[01:12:04.878 --> 01:12:07.879]  They die from system-wide intoxication and toxic shock.
[01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:12.661]  Doctors call it the cytokine storm following infection and immune hyperstimulation.
[01:12:13.201 --> 01:12:18.363]  Vaccines with immune stimulants or toxic drugs chemicalize your body, adding to your death risk.
[01:12:18.943 --> 01:12:23.187]  Prevent death and reverse diseases from infections, vaccinations, and drug toxicity.
[01:12:23.467 --> 01:12:29.472]  Call this number to get my free special report about the flu and what to do to save lives, maybe even your own.
[01:12:29.892 --> 01:12:31.153]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz.
[01:12:31.533 --> 01:12:34.936]  Order Zeolife, the world's most powerful broad-spectrum detoxifier.
[01:12:35.196 --> 01:12:35.456]  Thank you.
[01:12:59.804 --> 01:13:05.687]  Did you know that the dollar has lost 10% of its value against other currencies in the last 90 days?
[01:13:06.128 --> 01:13:10.790]  Ever think about how inflation will change your life, your savings, your retirement plans?
[01:13:11.071 --> 01:13:14.893]  Remember inflation in Zimbabwe, Argentina, the Weimar Republic?
[01:13:15.153 --> 01:13:16.334]  Let's put this another way.
[01:13:16.494 --> 01:13:21.697]  Who cares if your investments go up 10% but you lose 40% of your purchasing power?
[01:13:21.857 --> 01:13:24.478]  Gold still buys the same amount of stuff it always did.
[01:13:24.758 --> 01:13:27.120]  Gold does not require trust in a third party.
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:28.801]  You can possess it in your hand.
[01:13:29.121 --> 01:13:30.061]  You can take it with you.
[01:13:30.381 --> 01:13:31.441]  Gold is real money.
[01:13:31.861 --> 01:13:32.962]  Gold is honest money.
[01:13:33.222 --> 01:13:35.442]  My name is Daniel Larson from Midas Resources.
[01:13:35.942 --> 01:13:43.163]  To find out how you can protect your savings and roll over your IRA funds into precious metal accounts, call me at 800-686-2237, extension 134.
[01:13:43.203 --> 01:13:44.304]  That's 800-686-2237, extension 134.
[01:13:44.344 --> 01:13:45.084]  800-686-2237, extension 134.
[01:14:01.209 --> 01:14:04.856]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:14:05.236 --> 01:14:08.242]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:14:08.482 --> 01:14:09.905]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:14:10.603 --> 01:14:13.264]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:14:13.284 --> 01:14:19.505]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:14:19.665 --> 01:14:24.706]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:14:25.207 --> 01:14:34.849]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:14:34.949 --> 01:14:37.070]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:14:37.311 --> 01:14:38.631]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:14:38.892 --> 01:14:41.173]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:14:41.353 --> 01:14:43.195]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:14:43.475 --> 01:14:48.278]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:14:48.618 --> 01:14:53.401]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:14:53.641 --> 01:14:57.724]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:00.721]  Attention!
[01:15:00.901 --> 01:15:15.975]  An important product from hempusa.org, micro plant powder, will change your life by removing all types of positive toxins, such as heavy metals, parasites, bacteria, viruses, and fungus from the digestive tract and stomach wall so you can absorb nutrients.
[01:15:16.275 --> 01:15:17.977]  Micro plant powder is 89% silica and
[01:15:19.298 --> 01:15:19.978]  We're good to go!
[01:15:45.145 --> 01:15:45.646]  I think so.
[01:16:01.135 --> 01:16:06.977]  Look, I'm gonna spend more time on the COINTELPRO.
[01:16:29.423 --> 01:16:30.363]  In the days to come.
[01:16:30.383 --> 01:16:35.525]  We're going to have a lot more articles at PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com, but this is a big deal.
[01:16:35.965 --> 01:16:38.646]  This is why we can't ever organize marches or protests.
[01:16:38.826 --> 01:16:46.369]  Because you go and the cops attack their own people, and then attack you, the peaceful crowd, and the news blames old women and women with...
[01:16:47.509 --> 01:16:50.792]  With the baby carriages for what happened when it's the government.
[01:16:51.132 --> 01:16:56.356]  I'll never forget five years ago seeing footage out of Portland, Oregon that made me physically ill.
[01:16:57.037 --> 01:17:01.921]  It was a few thousand peaceful people against the war and the police come out and surround them.
[01:17:03.246 --> 01:17:03.886]  And no one does?
[01:17:03.946 --> 01:17:05.848]  And the police say, move back, move back, move back.
[01:17:05.868 --> 01:17:06.688]  They are moving back.
[01:17:07.008 --> 01:17:12.251]  And the cops walk right over and spray a baby in a carriage, right in the face.
[01:17:12.711 --> 01:17:17.174]  And the woman says, and the baby's on the edge of dying, having this pumped up their nose.
[01:17:17.754 --> 01:17:19.295]  She says, why did you do that to my baby?
[01:17:19.375 --> 01:17:21.857]  And he says, listen, you effing bleeper.
[01:17:22.377 --> 01:17:24.118]  You don't bring a baby to a protest.
[01:17:24.718 --> 01:17:27.460]  And they just beat the daylights out of those people.
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:28.760]  And guess what?
[01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:30.541]  They never went out and protested again.
[01:17:30.881 --> 01:17:54.467]  To where all that's left is 30 or 40 hired foundation thugs, led by cops in anarchist outfits, and a few meth-head idiots that don't know it's a federal operation, running around tumping over trash cans and lighting them on fire, so then the police can come in and... No one was resisting the police, so then they started going and finding women coming out of stores with grocery bags and police dogs attacking them.
[01:17:54.587 --> 01:17:56.348]  Because no one's allowed on the streets of Pittsburgh!
[01:17:57.168 --> 01:18:06.574]  And then, going on the university at night, and the college students are out at the park, and they're like, cops are marching up, and they announce, no one's allowed on the streets, day or night of Pittsburgh!
[01:18:06.955 --> 01:18:07.555]  Move back!
[01:18:08.235 --> 01:18:09.136]  They try to move back.
[01:18:09.196 --> 01:18:10.317]  The police had surrounded them.
[01:18:11.818 --> 01:18:19.763]  And they just run up to women on bikes, running from them, and just start beating them, blood spewing, as they just drive spikes in America's heart.
[01:18:20.404 --> 01:18:23.025]  And it's all a psych warfare test of those police.
[01:18:23.586 --> 01:18:24.406]  What will they do?
[01:18:24.566 --> 01:18:25.787]  What will they go along with?
[01:18:25.907 --> 01:18:26.808]  What will they accept?
[01:18:28.374 --> 01:18:37.179]  I have a message here to the COINTELPRO operatives in private corporations, in foundations, in government, in think tanks, and your camp followers.
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:40.801]  I have a message for you.
[01:18:41.541 --> 01:18:54.588]  When you lose everything you've got, when this country falls apart, when you're living in a living hell and we're worse than Mexico in a decade or so from now, maybe even sooner, I want you to remember when the system you served
[01:18:55.769 --> 01:19:00.771]  rapes you financially, physically, economically, societally, spiritually.
[01:19:00.911 --> 01:19:08.155]  I want you to remember you thought this was all cute and fun because there's a lot of weak people in this country and worldwide who serve evil.
[01:19:08.195 --> 01:19:08.595]  They think
[01:19:09.625 --> 01:19:10.666]  Darkness is power.
[01:19:11.106 --> 01:19:15.429]  They think skulls and death and the trappings and torture is cool.
[01:19:16.289 --> 01:19:16.990]  It's a spirit.
[01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:18.331]  It's a mindset.
[01:19:18.771 --> 01:19:22.353]  They think Jack Bauer is cool, torturing innocent people every episode to get answers.
[01:19:22.794 --> 01:19:24.255]  Torturing kids in front of their parents.
[01:19:24.755 --> 01:19:27.637]  Homeland Security admitted that was their own propaganda promotion.
[01:19:30.319 --> 01:19:33.061]  You are being bathed, baptized in hell.
[01:19:33.821 --> 01:19:34.922]  You're only alive once.
[01:19:36.977 --> 01:19:39.499]  And I'm telling you, it's not too late for you to turn back.
[01:19:39.579 --> 01:19:41.400]  It's not too late for you to have integrity.
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:43.722]  It's not too late for you to blow the whistle.
[01:19:45.183 --> 01:19:48.645]  And that's why the globalists are inoculating against whistleblowers now.
[01:19:50.627 --> 01:19:55.030]  That's why they come out in white papers now and Gary Hart says, yeah, we staged terror attacks in America.
[01:19:57.267 --> 01:19:58.927]  That's why the government declassifies?
[01:19:59.007 --> 01:20:01.548]  Yeah, we staged the Gulf of Tonkin, we staged other terror attacks.
[01:20:02.068 --> 01:20:05.369]  That's why they come out and say, yeah, we're going to infiltrate groups, get them to commit crimes.
[01:20:06.149 --> 01:20:07.389]  Yeah, we're going to ban free speech.
[01:20:07.769 --> 01:20:09.249]  Just so it loses its power.
[01:20:09.609 --> 01:20:12.250]  See, I tell you, they're going to start trying to restrict free speech.
[01:20:12.270 --> 01:20:13.590]  You laughed at me five years ago.
[01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:17.551]  But now it's like, okay, well maybe we do need to ban free speech.
[01:20:18.291 --> 01:20:22.012]  Because at a subconscious level, you're afraid of those tyrants.
[01:20:22.372 --> 01:20:24.252]  You're afraid of those authority figures.
[01:20:24.692 --> 01:20:26.933]  You can't imagine saying no to a bully.
[01:20:28.430 --> 01:20:33.752]  And so you engage in Crimestop, that George Orwell talked about, where the tyranny is upon you.
[01:20:33.792 --> 01:20:34.953]  You're facing the tyranny.
[01:20:35.393 --> 01:20:37.894]  And he wrote about that in non-fiction essays.
[01:20:38.194 --> 01:20:41.636]  He wrote more non-fiction than he wrote fiction.
[01:20:42.711 --> 01:20:44.732]  A member of the imperial secret police in India.
[01:20:45.232 --> 01:20:46.553]  A communist brigade leader.
[01:20:47.033 --> 01:20:48.594]  A propagandist at BBC.
[01:20:48.614 --> 01:20:50.495]  I mean, he was high level, folks.
[01:20:50.916 --> 01:20:53.637]  And he finally figured out, my God, they control the left and right.
[01:20:53.957 --> 01:20:56.158]  My God, it's a priesthood of power.
[01:20:56.439 --> 01:20:59.941]  It's a priesthood of psychopaths that like to torture people.
[01:21:01.141 --> 01:21:03.082]  And they play us all off against each other.
[01:21:03.583 --> 01:21:09.686]  And Big Brother is bombing Airstrip One to keep society in degradation and fear.
[01:21:13.732 --> 01:21:17.621]  Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you, these psychopaths weave a web.
[01:21:18.102 --> 01:21:20.587]  Like certain species of spiders weave a certain web.
[01:21:23.707 --> 01:21:25.609]  And we know the web they're spinning.
[01:21:25.689 --> 01:21:26.770]  And now the web's done.
[01:21:26.830 --> 01:21:29.692]  We're like, this is the most hardcore, vicious form of tyranny ever seen.
[01:21:29.932 --> 01:21:30.372]  Red alert!
[01:21:30.412 --> 01:21:30.933]  We've seen it!
[01:21:31.053 --> 01:21:32.494]  They're openly announcing it's evil.
[01:21:32.714 --> 01:21:35.937]  They're openly announcing they plan to arrest everybody and start killing people.
[01:21:36.157 --> 01:21:39.659]  They openly write textbooks about how they want to exterminate at least 80% of the population.
[01:21:40.140 --> 01:21:40.620]  Red alert!
[01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:41.101]  Red alert!
[01:21:41.141 --> 01:21:41.581]  Red alert!
[01:21:41.621 --> 01:21:42.041]  Red alert!
[01:21:42.061 --> 01:21:42.482]  Red alert!
[01:21:42.522 --> 01:21:42.922]  Red alert!
[01:21:42.962 --> 01:21:43.442]  Red alert!
[01:21:43.903 --> 01:21:45.584]  I mean, this is red alert!
[01:21:45.964 --> 01:21:46.865]  Red alert!
[01:21:46.925 --> 01:21:48.166]  We know who this is!
[01:21:48.386 --> 01:21:49.467]  We know what it is!
[01:21:50.148 --> 01:21:51.108]  We're on the march.
[01:21:51.549 --> 01:21:53.070]  The empire's on the run.
[01:21:54.049 --> 01:21:56.766]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:00.165 --> 01:22:02.787]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:22:03.187 --> 01:22:08.150]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:10.251]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:22:10.551 --> 01:22:15.374]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:22:15.554 --> 01:22:16.514]  How much do you want?
[01:22:16.734 --> 01:22:17.495]  When do you want it?
[01:22:17.875 --> 01:22:19.476]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:22:19.756 --> 01:22:20.577]  When will you need it?
[01:22:20.817 --> 01:22:22.878]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:22:23.038 --> 01:22:24.139]  Will there be any food?
[01:22:24.379 --> 01:22:25.680]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:28.261]  Quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[01:22:28.422 --> 01:22:30.964]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:22:31.144 --> 01:22:34.326]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:22:34.746 --> 01:22:38.249]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:22:38.549 --> 01:22:39.550]  How much will you need?
[01:22:39.790 --> 01:22:40.391]  We don't know.
[01:22:40.691 --> 01:22:41.592]  How much do you want?
[01:22:41.792 --> 01:22:42.512]  All you can get.
[01:22:42.532 --> 01:22:43.413]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:22:43.493 --> 01:22:43.893]  We're good.
[01:23:00.672 --> 01:23:01.212]  Hi, neighbor.
[01:23:01.532 --> 01:23:07.035]  No matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply, every single one of us who have prepared will have two regrets.
[01:23:07.675 --> 01:23:13.418]  Even those who haven't wasted a single penny on Christmas, birthdays, and vacations in order to store all the food possible.
[01:23:14.158 --> 01:23:17.419]  Even those who have sold stuff and taken on part-time jobs to buy food.
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:21.241]  Even those who have traded their gold while it will still buy food.
[01:23:21.957 --> 01:23:25.319]  Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy and foolish.
[01:23:25.940 --> 01:23:30.442]  When folks won't be able to afford food and there won't be any food for any amount of money.
[01:23:31.163 --> 01:23:33.144]  We will still have two regrets.
[01:23:33.805 --> 01:23:37.147]  We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food sooner.
[01:23:37.827 --> 01:23:40.709]  We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food.
[01:23:41.489 --> 01:23:46.893]  Putting off emergency food preparations will be the most dangerous decision that some of us will ever make.
[01:23:47.688 --> 01:23:48.468]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:23:48.628 --> 01:23:55.190]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:23:55.210 --> 01:23:57.270]  800-409-5633.
[01:24:01.291 --> 01:24:04.912]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:24:05.292 --> 01:24:08.313]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:24:08.553 --> 01:24:09.953]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:24:10.675 --> 01:24:13.316]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:24:13.336 --> 01:24:19.538]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:24:19.718 --> 01:24:24.760]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:34.903]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:24:35.023 --> 01:24:37.125]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:24:37.365 --> 01:24:38.706]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:24:38.966 --> 01:24:41.228]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:24:41.408 --> 01:24:43.250]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:24:43.530 --> 01:24:48.314]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:24:48.694 --> 01:24:57.801]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:25:18.702 --> 01:25:27.849]  See, they want to isolate and demonize every real group so that other people don't affiliate with it and come together with a unified culture of liberty.
[01:25:28.706 --> 01:25:34.390]  They want to taint the culture of liberty by mixing all sorts of untasteful stuff in with it.
[01:25:34.971 --> 01:25:40.695]  Now, I'm going to go to your calls, John, Stephanie, Steve, John, and Brian, but I promise myself to play this today.
[01:25:40.735 --> 01:25:41.636]  It's eight minutes long.
[01:25:43.337 --> 01:25:48.361]  This is a brief history of what the Star Spangled Banner really stands for.
[01:25:48.721 --> 01:25:50.363]  What is America really about?
[01:25:50.843 --> 01:26:00.891]  And think how far we've come from the land of liberty and bravery and strength and honor to a country where they demonize our founders and what this nation's really all been about.
[01:26:01.251 --> 01:26:02.532]  That's another COINTELPRO.
[01:26:02.913 --> 01:26:05.535]  Our country isn't perfect, but it's been the best we've ever seen.
[01:26:06.601 --> 01:26:09.642]  Those founding ideas changed the world.
[01:26:10.203 --> 01:26:16.265]  Now, ancient tyranny is coming back and replacing the flower of the Renaissance, what happened here in 1776.
[01:26:17.886 --> 01:26:21.928]  And what you're about to hear is the true story on record.
[01:26:22.811 --> 01:26:23.171]  I think?
[01:26:46.246 --> 01:26:48.768]  We would have never turned into this society.
[01:26:48.828 --> 01:26:49.889]  But we became decadent.
[01:26:50.129 --> 01:26:51.030]  We became wicked.
[01:26:51.370 --> 01:26:52.611]  We bought into corruption.
[01:26:52.911 --> 01:26:58.055]  We need to rediscover the founding documents and breathe life into it.
[01:26:58.275 --> 01:26:59.296]  And that is starting to happen.
[01:26:59.556 --> 01:27:04.680]  So here is the true story of the Star Spangled Banner.
[01:27:04.780 --> 01:27:06.281]  Our national anthem.
[01:27:06.321 --> 01:27:07.542]  What it really stands for.
[01:27:07.783 --> 01:27:09.524]  It's now been expropriated.
[01:27:09.584 --> 01:27:10.885]  It's been taken by the media.
[01:27:10.925 --> 01:27:11.786]  Taken by the government.
[01:27:12.186 --> 01:27:13.247]  Used to sell their wars.
[01:27:13.687 --> 01:27:15.108]  They're lies, they're frauds.
[01:27:15.389 --> 01:27:21.254]  When George Washington said, never invade another country, don't get involved in foreign entanglements.
[01:27:21.674 --> 01:27:28.320]  Our own troops die of DU, having their health care cut, but the government always wraps themselves in the troops heroism.
[01:27:30.211 --> 01:27:35.553]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, break your conditioning, wake up, make the choice, choose sides in life.
[01:27:35.853 --> 01:27:36.913]  You're only alive once.
[01:27:37.334 --> 01:27:40.635]  Join the battle for the Republic and free humanity worldwide.
[01:27:40.935 --> 01:27:42.335]  We are starting to have victories.
[01:27:42.676 --> 01:27:43.816]  The enemy hates that.
[01:27:44.296 --> 01:27:47.377]  They want us to think they're invincible, that we will be assimilated.
[01:27:47.757 --> 01:27:50.919]  Here it is, the true story of the Star Spangled Banner.
[01:27:53.479 --> 01:27:54.740]  The Star Spangled Banner.
[01:28:02.298 --> 01:28:03.459]  What does it really stand for?
[01:28:03.479 --> 01:28:07.503]  There was a lawyer once.
[01:28:07.563 --> 01:28:09.685]  His name was Francis Scott Key.
[01:28:11.146 --> 01:28:13.268]  He penned a song that I'm sure you're aware of.
[01:28:13.288 --> 01:28:13.788]  You've seen it.
[01:28:13.828 --> 01:28:15.490]  It's in most hymnals throughout our churches.
[01:28:15.570 --> 01:28:17.372]  It's called the National Anthem.
[01:28:17.792 --> 01:28:19.814]  It is our song as an American.
[01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:22.981]  We go, however, to a ball game.
[01:28:23.021 --> 01:28:29.905]  We stand in our church services and we sing the words of that song, and they float over our minds and our lips and we don't even realize what we're singing.
[01:28:29.945 --> 01:28:34.228]  Most of us have memorized it as a child, but we've never really thought about what it means.
[01:28:34.268 --> 01:28:35.449]  Let me tell you a story.
[01:28:36.729 --> 01:28:38.931]  Francis Scott Key was a lawyer in Baltimore.
[01:28:40.812 --> 01:28:45.875]  The colonies were engaged in vicious conflict with the mother country, Britain.
[01:28:47.594 --> 01:28:52.677]  Because of this conflict and the protractedness of it, they had accumulated prisoners on both sides.
[01:28:52.717 --> 01:28:55.379]  The American colonies had prisoners and the British had prisoners.
[01:28:55.979 --> 01:28:58.160]  And the American government initiated a move.
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:01.963]  They went to the British and they said, let us negotiate for the release of these prisoners.
[01:29:04.965 --> 01:29:07.366]  They said, we want to send a man out to discuss this with you.
[01:29:07.406 --> 01:29:11.969]  They were holding the American prisoners in boats about a thousand yards offshore.
[01:29:12.802 --> 01:29:15.544]  And they said, we want to send a man by the name of Francis Scott Key.
[01:29:15.584 --> 01:29:19.607]  He will come out and negotiate to see if we can make a mutual exchange.
[01:29:20.948 --> 01:29:25.291]  On the appointed day, in a rowboat, he went out to this boat and he negotiated with the British officials.
[01:29:26.372 --> 01:29:30.214]  And they reached a conclusion that men could be exchanged on a one-for-one basis.
[01:29:31.996 --> 01:29:39.101]  Francis Scott Key, jubilant with the fact that he'd been successful, went down below in the boat and what he found was a cargo hold full of humanity men.
[01:29:41.590 --> 01:29:44.432]  And he said, man, I've got news for you tonight, you're free.
[01:29:45.994 --> 01:29:50.177]  He said, tonight I have negotiated successfully your return to the colonies.
[01:29:50.517 --> 01:29:53.720]  He said, you'll be taken out of this boat, out of this filth, out of your chains.
[01:29:55.781 --> 01:30:00.865]  As he went back up on board to arrange for their passage to the shore, the Admiral came and he said, we have a slight problem.
[01:30:01.986 --> 01:30:07.391]  He said, we will still honor our commitment to release these men, but it'll be merely academic after tonight.
[01:30:08.351 --> 01:30:08.872]  It won't matter.
[01:30:10.993 --> 01:30:12.474]  And Francis Scott Key said, what do you mean?
[01:30:14.575 --> 01:30:20.678]  He said, well, Mr. Key, he said, tonight we have laid an ultimatum upon the colonies.
[01:30:21.979 --> 01:30:30.324]  Your people will either capitulate and lay down the colors of that flag that you think so much of, or you see that fort right over there, Fort Henry?
[01:30:31.464 --> 01:30:33.845]  He said, we're going to remove it from the face of the earth.
[01:30:35.406 --> 01:30:36.427]  He said, how are you going to do that?
[01:30:37.932 --> 01:30:40.572]  He said, if you will, scan the horizon of the sea.
[01:30:40.612 --> 01:30:44.193]  And as he looked, he could see hundreds of little dots.
[01:30:45.753 --> 01:30:48.494]  And he said, that's the entire British war fleet.
[01:30:50.054 --> 01:30:54.775]  He said, all of the gunpower, all of the armament is being called upon to demolish that fort.
[01:30:55.955 --> 01:30:59.696]  It will be here within striking distance in a matter of about two and a half hours.
[01:31:00.416 --> 01:31:01.396]  He said, the war is over.
[01:31:01.436 --> 01:31:02.696]  These men would be free anyway.
[01:31:04.457 --> 01:31:05.917]  He said, you can't shell that fort.
[01:31:07.833 --> 01:31:09.354]  He said, that's a large fort.
[01:31:09.394 --> 01:31:11.196]  He said, it's full of women and children.
[01:31:11.536 --> 01:31:14.218]  He says, it's predominantly not a military fort.
[01:31:16.359 --> 01:31:17.440]  They said, don't worry about it.
[01:31:18.821 --> 01:31:20.142]  They said, we've left them a way out.
[01:31:20.182 --> 01:31:20.923]  He said, what's that?
[01:31:22.224 --> 01:31:25.306]  He said, do you see that flag way up on the rampart?
[01:31:26.927 --> 01:31:32.851]  He said, we have told them that if they will lower that flag, the shelling will stop immediately.
[01:31:34.733 --> 01:31:36.174]  And we'll know that they've surrendered.
[01:31:36.966 --> 01:31:38.507]  And you'll now be under British rule.
[01:31:42.110 --> 01:31:45.472]  Francis Scott Key went down below and told the men what was about to happen.
[01:31:47.454 --> 01:31:48.415]  And they said, how many ships?
[01:31:48.455 --> 01:31:49.435]  He said, hundreds.
[01:31:51.757 --> 01:31:52.698]  The ships got closer.
[01:31:52.738 --> 01:31:57.541]  Francis Scott Key went back up on top and he said, men, I'll shout down to you what's going on as we watch.
[01:31:59.963 --> 01:32:05.147]  As twilight began to fall, and as the haze hung over the ocean as it does at sunset,
[01:32:06.642 --> 01:32:09.164]  Suddenly, the British War Fleet unleashed.
[01:32:12.646 --> 01:32:14.428]  He says, the sound was deafening.
[01:32:14.468 --> 01:32:17.189]  There were so many guns that there were no reliefs.
[01:32:17.810 --> 01:32:20.492]  He said, it was absolutely impossible to talk or hear.
[01:32:20.512 --> 01:32:23.354]  He said, suddenly the sky, although dark, was suddenly lit.
[01:32:23.374 --> 01:32:31.219]  And he says, from down below, all he could hear the men, the prisoners, saying was, tell us where the flag is.
[01:32:33.701 --> 01:32:34.862]  What have they done with the flag?
[01:32:37.515 --> 01:32:39.677]  Is the flag still flying over the rampart?
[01:32:39.717 --> 01:32:40.137]  Tell us!
[01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:46.082]  One hour, two hours, three hours into the shelling.
[01:32:49.044 --> 01:33:00.554]  Every time the bomb would explode and it would be close to the flag, they could see the flag in the illuminated red glare of that bomb, and Francis Scott Key would report down to the men below, it's still up.
[01:33:02.695 --> 01:33:03.236]  It's not down.
[01:33:07.591 --> 01:33:09.893]  The Admiral came and he said, your people are insane.
[01:33:09.973 --> 01:33:11.274]  He said, what's the matter with them?
[01:33:13.496 --> 01:33:16.619]  He said, don't they understand this is an impossible situation?
[01:33:18.801 --> 01:33:22.084]  Francis Scott Key said, he remembered what George Washington had said.
[01:33:22.164 --> 01:33:32.213]  He said, the thing that sets the American Christian apart from all other people in the world is he will die on his feet before he'll live on his knees.
[01:33:35.779 --> 01:33:42.602]  The Admiral said, we have now instructed all of the guns to focus on the rampart to take that flag down.
[01:33:43.862 --> 01:33:45.323]  He said, we don't understand something.
[01:33:46.103 --> 01:33:52.126]  Our reconnaissance tells us that that flag has been hit directly again and again and again and yet it's still flying.
[01:33:52.146 --> 01:33:53.086]  We don't understand that.
[01:33:56.168 --> 01:34:00.409]  But he said, now we're about to bring every gun for the next three hours to bear on that point.
[01:34:00.730 --> 01:34:03.711]  Francis Scott Keyes said the barrage was unmerciful.
[01:34:06.656 --> 01:34:12.738]  All that he could hear was the men down below praying.
[01:34:15.379 --> 01:34:16.000]  The prayer.
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:22.342]  God keep that flag flying where we last saw it.
[01:34:26.403 --> 01:34:27.344]  Sunrise came.
[01:34:29.504 --> 01:34:33.366]  He said there was a heavy mist hanging over the land but the rampart was tall enough
[01:34:34.952 --> 01:34:39.114]  There stood the flag, completely nondescript, in shreds.
[01:34:40.695 --> 01:34:46.398]  The flagpole itself was at a crazy angle, but the flag was still at the top.
[01:34:49.339 --> 01:34:54.462]  Francis Scott Key went aboard, and immediately went into Fort Henry to see what had happened.
[01:34:58.444 --> 01:35:04.147]  And what he found had happened was that that flagpole and that flag had suffered repetitious direct hits.
[01:35:06.374 --> 01:35:30.780]  And when it had fallen, but men, fathers, who knew what it meant for that flag to be on the ground, although knowing that all of the British guns were trained on it, walked over and held it up, humanly, until they died.
[01:35:33.806 --> 01:35:36.927]  Their bodies were removed and others took their place.
[01:35:38.927 --> 01:35:46.209]  Francis Scott Key said what held that flagpole in place at that unusual angle were patriots' bodies.
[01:35:48.589 --> 01:35:55.271]  He penned the song, Oh Say Can You See by the Dawn's Early Light.
[01:35:57.131 --> 01:36:01.652]  What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming.
[01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:14.163]  Or the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, gave proof through the night that the flag was still there.
[01:36:17.944 --> 01:36:29.467]  Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet fly and wave o'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
[01:36:31.983 --> 01:36:33.649]  The debt was demanded.
[01:36:34.953 --> 01:36:37.220]  The price, it was paid.
[01:36:39.628 --> 01:36:42.730]  Alright folks, now look at what our country's turned into now.
[01:36:42.950 --> 01:36:55.359]  A operations base for criminal offshore banks to export tyranny worldwide and enslave us here at home, with government COINTELPRO saying that if you don't want socialist healthcare, you're a racist.
[01:36:55.879 --> 01:36:56.780]  That's COINTELPRO.
[01:36:57.180 --> 01:37:06.027]  Playing that against people, creating racial division, infiltrating groups, trying to radicalize them, trying to get people to commit acts of violence so they can put them in prison.
[01:37:06.847 --> 01:37:11.628]  Openly saying they want to restrict our free speech that our forefathers fought and died for.
[01:37:11.968 --> 01:37:13.508]  This is outrageous.
[01:37:13.928 --> 01:37:18.189]  We, the patriots, the constitutionalists, we're the good guys.
[01:37:18.549 --> 01:37:20.149]  We're trying to save the Republic.
[01:37:20.789 --> 01:37:30.831]  And anybody that stands against that, anybody that calls for abolishing the Bill of Rights, which they're doing right now, is a treasonous, traitorous, larcenous enemy of humanity.
[01:37:31.111 --> 01:37:31.651]  Period.
[01:37:33.272 --> 01:37:33.732]  Period.
[01:37:34.232 --> 01:37:35.332]  Now here is Steve Voss.
[01:37:36.622 --> 01:37:43.047]  And his rendition of the Star Spangled Banner, now that you know what it really stands for.
[01:37:43.368 --> 01:37:48.872]  And that's why, with COINTELPRO, they've demonized our country's history so they could replace it with the New World Order.
[01:37:49.152 --> 01:37:50.534]  That's why they hate our founders.
[01:37:51.314 --> 01:37:51.755]  Here it is.
[01:37:51.775 --> 01:38:03.985]  Oh, say can you see
[01:38:06.345 --> 01:38:26.071]  By the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed At the twilight's last gleaming?
[01:38:27.551 --> 01:38:32.513]  Whose broad stripes and bright stars
[01:38:34.571 --> 01:38:53.608]  Through the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watched, Were so gallantly streaming?
[01:38:55.990 --> 01:39:01.015]  And the rocket's red glare,
[01:39:03.044 --> 01:39:29.658]  The bombs bursting in air Gave proof through the night That our flag was still there Oh, say does that star-spangled
[01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:46.026]  Oh, say does that star spangled banner yet wave
[01:40:08.429 --> 01:40:10.130]  The globalist
[01:40:32.455 --> 01:40:37.017]  Don't teach in schools or anywhere else why the Star Spangled Banner is so important.
[01:40:38.277 --> 01:40:45.480]  What we saw, the type of valiant activity at the Alamo, was the tail end of the true flower of our Republic, but it can bloom again.
[01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:52.362]  And I want you guys to cue it up to the front of that video, the start of the video we played with the George Washington quote.
[01:40:52.422 --> 01:40:55.003]  I want to read that here on air for people.
[01:40:56.204 --> 01:40:59.645]  To understand what the costs are and where we came from and what we aren't.
[01:41:00.566 --> 01:41:04.431]  And our responsibility to turn this around and to fix it.
[01:41:05.032 --> 01:41:08.977]  I have FEMA on video calling George Washington an evil terrorist.
[01:41:10.179 --> 01:41:16.788]  This is an alien, evil group of corrupt people that hate our country, that are in control of this nation.
[01:41:18.502 --> 01:41:27.705]  And it's our right and our responsibility as the Declaration of Independent States to stand against them and to speak out against them and to expose them for the illegitimate criminals they are.
[01:41:28.465 --> 01:41:36.287]  They're doing everything they can to demonize the American people right now, to demonize true Americanism, true freedom, but it's not going to work.
[01:41:37.952 --> 01:41:39.473]  It's not going to happen.
[01:41:39.513 --> 01:41:41.755]  The spirit of freedom is rising.
[01:41:41.775 --> 01:41:43.736]  Did you guys find that George Washington quote?
[01:41:43.756 --> 01:41:49.700]  I want to put it up on screen for people and I want to read it here on air before we go to break.
[01:41:51.121 --> 01:41:56.184]  Because George Washington boiled it all down.
[01:41:58.205 --> 01:42:00.127]  Why this nation was able to be founded.
[01:42:00.227 --> 01:42:01.688]  Why we were able to persevere.
[01:42:04.625 --> 01:42:15.511]  And so I say to everybody out there, if you didn't know why the Star Spangled Banner is so special, that's another example of how you've been robbed of your true history and who you really are.
[01:42:16.571 --> 01:42:20.954]  And it's in rediscovering who we really are that we can defeat this new world order.
[01:42:22.815 --> 01:42:25.156]  And that's the bottom line, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:29.198 --> 01:42:38.245]  The thing that sets the American Christian apart from all other people in the world is he will die on his feet before he will live on his knees.
[01:42:38.446 --> 01:42:39.607]  George Washington.
[01:42:39.747 --> 01:42:50.135]  Again, the thing that sets the American Christian apart from all other people in the world is that he will die on his feet before he will live on his knees.
[01:42:50.816 --> 01:42:55.740]  And that's what you saw from the true story of the Star Spangled Banner.
[01:42:56.801 --> 01:42:57.541]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:57.561 --> 01:42:58.002]  Stay with us.
[01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:05.662]  Afraid to answer it?
[01:43:06.563 --> 01:43:08.025]  Afraid to answer your door?
[01:43:08.445 --> 01:43:15.475]  Did you know that debt settlement, bankruptcy, and attorneys will cost you about ten times more than you would legally be required to pay creditors?
[01:43:15.755 --> 01:43:17.798]  These are not ways to help you get out of debt.
[01:43:17.978 --> 01:43:18.239]  They are
[01:43:25.503 --> 01:43:25.964]  We're good to go.
[01:43:44.906 --> 01:43:46.926]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:43:46.966 --> 01:43:48.347]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:43:48.367 --> 01:43:49.647]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:44:10.603 --> 01:44:13.244]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:44:13.264 --> 01:44:19.507]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:44:19.648 --> 01:44:24.690]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:44:25.030 --> 01:44:27.992]  All of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[01:44:28.112 --> 01:44:34.835]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:44:34.955 --> 01:44:37.056]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:44:37.297 --> 01:44:38.617]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:44:38.877 --> 01:44:41.179]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:44:41.339 --> 01:44:43.180]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:48.263]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:44:48.624 --> 01:44:57.729]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:59.884 --> 01:45:01.145]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:45:01.205 --> 01:45:06.531]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:45:06.791 --> 01:45:11.415]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:45:11.816 --> 01:45:16.881]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:45:17.381 --> 01:45:22.066]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:45:22.586 --> 01:45:29.512]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:45:29.712 --> 01:45:30.612]  And here's the best part.
[01:45:30.833 --> 01:45:37.197]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:45:37.518 --> 01:45:40.360]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:42.602]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:45:42.942 --> 01:45:43.863]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:45:43.883 --> 01:45:44.083]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:45:51.222 --> 01:45:56.248]  0365.
[01:45:51.722 --> 01:45:56.248]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:45:56.569 --> 01:45:58.952]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:46:04.062 --> 01:46:08.944]  You know, I've gotten better at getting to calls when I say I will, but I apologize to the callers this hour.
[01:46:09.404 --> 01:46:11.065]  We'll write down your first name if you want.
[01:46:11.085 --> 01:46:12.666]  You can go to the headline tomorrow.
[01:46:13.226 --> 01:46:16.848]  Everybody holding, John, Stephanie, Steven, John, Brian, and others.
[01:46:17.288 --> 01:46:18.629]  I just ran out of time today.
[01:46:19.109 --> 01:46:23.031]  And here in the last five minutes, I had four stacks of news I never got to.
[01:46:23.671 --> 01:46:25.792]  In the first two hours, I covered a lot of key news.
[01:46:27.543 --> 01:46:29.884]  I didn't even cover all the COINTELPRO angles I wanted to.
[01:46:29.944 --> 01:46:35.627]  It's just, it's so outrageous what the White House czar saying they're going to shut down free speech.
[01:46:35.687 --> 01:46:39.789]  I mean, they're openly saying, and then they're doing it.
[01:46:40.170 --> 01:46:41.910]  I mean, they're coming for everybody's freedom.
[01:46:41.930 --> 01:46:43.831]  They said they want to arrest me and others.
[01:46:45.012 --> 01:46:46.593]  I mean, this is so outrageous.
[01:46:46.633 --> 01:46:47.874]  And then I've got articles like this.
[01:46:48.334 --> 01:46:54.157]  I already knew this 10 years ago, but to see the Huffington Post reporting it of all places, that's good.
[01:46:56.175 --> 01:47:03.001]  Because, you know, your Democratic Party or Republican Party affiliation doesn't matter at the end of the day if you die.
[01:47:05.504 --> 01:47:14.152]  I've had top genetic engineers on who were making millions of dollars and were happy, and then they would come back and say, half the rats we feed this corn or potato to are dying.
[01:47:15.533 --> 01:47:17.855]  It's causing birth defects in all the baby mice.
[01:47:18.636 --> 01:47:20.278]  This is different varieties I'm talking about.
[01:47:21.508 --> 01:47:26.472]  And every major GMO crop has been proven, and the studies done by the companies, they know what it's doing.
[01:47:27.032 --> 01:47:28.653]  And it always attacks fertility.
[01:47:28.734 --> 01:47:30.135]  It's being done by design.
[01:47:31.055 --> 01:47:34.958]  And if it's a by-product that half the honeybees die because they eat the pollen of it, so be it.
[01:47:35.779 --> 01:47:37.040]  Put that back on screen, guys.
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:40.843]  Monsanto GMO corn linked to organ failure study reveals.
[01:47:41.963 --> 01:47:47.389]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, I see all the numbers of Crohn's disease and organ failure and all these blood cancers.
[01:47:47.790 --> 01:47:50.553]  They're all up a couple thousand percentage points on average.
[01:47:50.613 --> 01:48:00.024]  I mean, I know everybody I know in the office has had a girlfriend at 25 almost die or die of cancer, or their 30-year-old brother dying of Crohn's.
[01:48:03.867 --> 01:48:10.210]  The news is saying melamine and milk is good for you now, and mercury's good for you, and sunlight's bad for you.
[01:48:10.270 --> 01:48:11.891]  I mean, these people are out of their minds!
[01:48:14.672 --> 01:48:16.413]  They're just practicing insanity!
[01:48:17.453 --> 01:48:20.994]  Monsanto, GMO, corn linked to organ failure study reveals.
[01:48:21.014 --> 01:48:22.015]  I wanted to cover this last.
[01:48:23.629 --> 01:48:24.529]  What's your reaction?
[01:48:24.549 --> 01:48:41.194]  In a study released by the International Journal of Biological Sciences, there's no more prestigious, analyzing the effects of genetically modified foods on mammalian, that's mammals, that's us, research found that agricultural giant Monsanto's GMM corn is linked to organ damage in rats.
[01:48:42.312 --> 01:49:04.228]  According to the study, which was summarized by Randy at Fort Freedom, three varieties of Monsanto GM corn, MON863, insecticide-producing MON810, and Roundup herbicide-absorbing NK603, were approved for consumption by the U.S., European, and several other national food safety authorities, because they own the government.
[01:49:06.852 --> 01:49:18.318]  And then it goes into the major studies showing that effects were mostly concentrated in the kidney and liver function, the two major diet detoxification organs, and the detail differed for each GM type.
[01:49:18.338 --> 01:49:22.281]  And then it goes into the massive statistic damage to the organs.
[01:49:22.321 --> 01:49:27.744]  Folks, this is the same corn variety that when the bees eat it, eat the pollen,
[01:49:28.891 --> 01:49:29.812]  They go die.
[01:49:30.192 --> 01:49:30.552]  Why?
[01:49:31.073 --> 01:49:37.478]  Monsanto said, well, we'll make it 5,000 times stronger, this naturally occurring pesticide that's in corn.
[01:49:37.818 --> 01:49:46.685]  We'll make it, develop it inside the corn, depending on the variety, 1,000 to 5,000 times the level, and then you eat a pesticide.
[01:49:50.648 --> 01:49:52.689]  It's a fungus pesticide.
[01:49:53.230 --> 01:49:54.591]  A little bit of it grows on corn.
[01:49:55.981 --> 01:49:56.821]  It doesn't do anything to you.
[01:49:57.562 --> 01:49:59.182]  And they know what it's doing!
[01:49:59.602 --> 01:50:01.383]  And I'm the conspiracy theorist!
[01:50:02.263 --> 01:50:02.803]  I'm bad!
[01:50:02.863 --> 01:50:03.704]  I need to be arrested!
[01:50:03.944 --> 01:50:08.305]  I need to have them infiltrate my office and set me up and send me to prison, according to the White House.
[01:50:09.245 --> 01:50:09.726]  On record!
[01:50:10.146 --> 01:50:10.866]  We're all evil!
[01:50:12.627 --> 01:50:14.267]  Because we don't want our kids dying!
[01:50:15.387 --> 01:50:19.389]  And the feds, what, two years ago passed a law where they can say something's organic now when it's not?
[01:50:20.615 --> 01:50:22.917]  I mean, cops are drinking the fluoride.
[01:50:22.957 --> 01:50:24.258]  You're giving your kids this stuff.
[01:50:24.278 --> 01:50:25.339]  You still love the system.
[01:50:25.519 --> 01:50:26.800]  Same thing with all you bureaucrats.
