[00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:10.471]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.471 --> 00:00:12.052]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.052 --> 00:00:12.972]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.972 --> 00:00:17.814]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.814 --> 00:00:25.697]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.697 --> 00:00:30.999]  Another very important radio broadcast lined up for you today, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:32.500]  Monday, the 15th of March, 2000, and...
[00:00:35.423 --> 00:00:37.744]  10, the Ides of March.
[00:00:37.744 --> 00:00:43.485]  This is the one-year anniversary of the release of the Obama deception, man, time flies.
[00:00:43.485 --> 00:00:51.147]  Out of the gates, we are going to have Noah Taylor on the radio show today.
[00:00:51.147 --> 00:00:57.208]  He, of course, has got the new film premiering here in Austin, Texas, Red, White, and Blue.
[00:00:57.208 --> 00:00:59.849]  He, of course, is in Pirates of the Caribbean.
[00:00:59.849 --> 00:01:00.889]  He's one of the main stars.
[00:01:03.371 --> 00:01:09.713]  He also, of course, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, played Charlie's dad or grandfather.
[00:01:09.713 --> 00:01:17.416]  The Proposition, The Life Aquatic, Tomb Raider, played the villain, I guess.
[00:01:17.416 --> 00:01:20.697]  He played Max in 2002, the young Adolf Hitler.
[00:01:20.697 --> 00:01:23.838]  I was very moved by that film.
[00:01:23.838 --> 00:01:26.059]  The young Hitler as an artist.
[00:01:26.059 --> 00:01:30.761]  Vanilla Sky with Tom Cruise.
[00:01:32.585 --> 00:01:36.867]  He's been in several Tomb Raiders, almost famous, it just goes on and on.
[00:01:36.867 --> 00:01:55.174]  And I found out that he's a fan of the show, and I had remembered last summer seeing a little headline article in the Statesman with Noah Taylor saying that he got his Texas accent by listening to my radio show in King of the Hill.
[00:01:55.174 --> 00:01:57.055]  So they invited me down to the premiere last night.
[00:01:59.471 --> 00:02:03.674]  Of the extremely disturbing, but very well done film, Red, White and Blue.
[00:02:03.674 --> 00:02:08.136]  But this is not something you take the children to, I'll tell you that right now.
[00:02:08.136 --> 00:02:12.159]  He plays like a CIA killer.
[00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:15.861]  It's a very sophisticated movie.
[00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:18.303]  And very disturbing, as I said.
[00:02:18.303 --> 00:02:23.846]  But I went to the after party because I was invited to it.
[00:02:23.846 --> 00:02:26.228]  And he was really
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.383]  Ranting about stuff going on in England where he lives.
[00:02:31.383 --> 00:02:32.464]  He's from Australia.
[00:02:32.464 --> 00:02:48.318]  He lives in London and just the total mind control the nanny state So we got him coming up on the show If I had more notice we could have got him in studio, but he's got to be on I think live IFC Coming up in the next hour.
[00:02:48.318 --> 00:02:49.099]  He's got a bunch of TV.
[00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.521]  He's got to do so he's gonna be joining us on the phone and
[00:02:53.956 --> 00:03:03.003]  From the place where he's staying, he's gonna jump in the car, he'll be on cell phone for the second half of the interview while he's going to the TV studio.
[00:03:03.003 --> 00:03:04.684]  He's here in Austin, Texas.
[00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:09.908]  We'll be talking about the New World Order and his new film, Red, White & Blue, with Noah Taylor.
[00:03:09.908 --> 00:03:11.029]  And I'm a fan of Noah Taylor.
[00:03:13.012 --> 00:03:18.217]  I mean, everything I've seen him in, it's been a very powerful performance.
[00:03:18.217 --> 00:03:23.862]  It's just strange to find out he's a fan of what we do here as well.
[00:03:23.862 --> 00:03:26.704]  And he said people are really listening to the show in England.
[00:03:26.704 --> 00:03:27.545]  I mean, we know that.
[00:03:27.545 --> 00:03:30.047]  I know they're listening in Japan, Greece, you name it.
[00:03:30.047 --> 00:03:33.690]  But just when you talk to people and they tell you the effect you're having, it's amazing.
[00:03:34.551 --> 00:03:45.059]  By the way, you know, the Southern Poverty Law Center has it out for me, really constantly trying to demonize me, trying to blame that cop killer on me, Poplosky.
[00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:53.346]  And now we got a recorded interview with one of their directors, just absolutely demonizing me.
[00:03:53.346 --> 00:03:56.028]  We are changed.
[00:03:56.028 --> 00:03:58.130]  Folks went in to talk to this lady.
[00:03:59.758 --> 00:04:08.123]  And I just heard the interview right before I went on air, but I want to get the folks that wanted to talk to him on here in the next few days, but I'm going to play some clips of this just to show you.
[00:04:08.123 --> 00:04:10.345]  I mean, they say everything in America is my fault.
[00:04:10.345 --> 00:04:18.510]  It's like that London Guardian article saying that this black hole of conspiracy mania orbits Austin, Texas, and I'm at the center of the black hole.
[00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.294]  I mean, that's the type of terms they're using.
[00:04:24.294 --> 00:04:25.615]  All I do is cover the news.
[00:04:27.612 --> 00:04:31.874]  Here's a headline, Venezuela's Chavez calls for internet controls.
[00:04:31.874 --> 00:04:33.275]  Reuters.
[00:04:33.275 --> 00:04:36.376]  And they're all demonizing him, and he deserves to be demonized.
[00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:40.358]  But our own government's proposing the exact same stuff, so they deserve to be demonized.
[00:04:40.358 --> 00:04:43.320]  They don't have to be demonized, they are demons.
[00:04:44.448 --> 00:04:47.832]  So I sit here and analyze the news and break it down and I'm just so bad.
[00:04:47.832 --> 00:04:48.532]  I'm so evil.
[00:04:48.532 --> 00:04:50.615]  I'm this heretic that has to be dealt with.
[00:04:50.615 --> 00:04:54.759]  So we'll be talking about that and a bunch of other news coming up today.
[00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:57.021]  Mexico gunman killed American consulate staff.
[00:04:57.021 --> 00:04:57.442]  Stay with us.

[00:06:11.574 --> 00:06:14.177]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:14.177 --> 00:06:20.562]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.562 --> 00:06:26.107]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:06:26.107 --> 00:06:35.736]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:06:35.836 --> 00:06:38.197]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:38.197 --> 00:06:39.778]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:39.778 --> 00:06:42.239]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:42.239 --> 00:06:44.361]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:44.361 --> 00:06:49.523]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:49.523 --> 00:06:58.628]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:07:16.049 --> 00:07:16.369]  I think so.
[00:07:35.501 --> 00:07:40.823]  Alternative energy, herbal medicines, privacy and security, as well as God, gold and guns.
[00:07:40.823 --> 00:07:42.944]  With absolutely no apologies.

[00:08:02.432 --> 00:08:09.075]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.075 --> 00:08:15.218]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.218 --> 00:08:27.163]  Back in 2002, my wife and I went to see Max at the Barton Creek Movie Theater in Austin, and I was very moved by Noah Taylor's performance of a young Adolf Hitler.
[00:08:28.473 --> 00:08:35.075]  Of course, I also really am impressed with the performance, the German performance of Downfall with an older actor.
[00:08:35.075 --> 00:08:40.437]  And I also like the performance that I saw from Alec Guinness of Adolf Hitler.
[00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:47.539]  But I think one of the best performances I've ever seen portraying Hitler was Noah Taylor.
[00:08:47.539 --> 00:08:49.540]  And just every movie he's in, he does a great job.
[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.721]  Whether it's the Tomb Raider series, about the only thing I like in there is him.
[00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:56.581]  We're good to go.
[00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:13.173]  And it's good to have Noah Taylor here with us today.
[00:09:13.173 --> 00:09:15.194]  He's got the new film out.
[00:09:15.194 --> 00:09:18.676]  I saw the Texas premiere of Red, White, and Blue.
[00:09:18.676 --> 00:09:25.200]  I didn't know that Ken League, who started the Alamo Draft House, great guy, was actually one of the executive producers on it.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.962]  But it's just all the Austin landmarks.
[00:09:27.962 --> 00:09:30.703]  Very disturbing film.
[00:09:30.703 --> 00:09:34.005]  Almost like a Hitchcock psychological thriller, though.
[00:09:34.005 --> 00:09:36.167]  It's not just a slasher film.
[00:09:36.167 --> 00:09:38.028]  There's a lot of mysteries there, a lot of
[00:09:39.895 --> 00:09:42.496]  I don't know, people like no country for old men.
[00:09:42.496 --> 00:09:46.458]  I think the cinematography on that's better, but I think this is a better story.
[00:09:46.458 --> 00:09:51.780]  But I guess it's also kind of shot to look like it's reality.
[00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:56.643]  A few times I was shaking my head thinking that I was actually there.
[00:09:56.643 --> 00:09:57.243]  Very disturbing.
[00:09:57.243 --> 00:10:02.465]  But I'm going to shut up because we've only got until about 45 after because he's got to go on IFC television.
[00:10:02.465 --> 00:10:04.526]  Noah Taylor, great to have you here with us.
[00:10:04.526 --> 00:10:06.827]  Hi Alex, real honor to be on the show.
[00:10:06.827 --> 00:10:07.948]  How are you doing?
[00:10:09.108 --> 00:10:10.829]  I am doing great, it's good to have you here.
[00:10:10.829 --> 00:10:17.473]  So what brought you to Austin and tell us about the film and your view on the New World Order, Noah.
[00:10:17.473 --> 00:10:26.278]  Okay, well starting with the film, Red, White, Blue, I was here for the U.S.
[00:10:26.278 --> 00:10:36.824]  premiere as part of South by Southwest in beautiful downtown Austin at the Alamo Draft House.
[00:10:36.824 --> 00:10:38.225]  And yeah, we came to Austin.
[00:10:38.909 --> 00:10:41.692]  I tell you, I'm still shaking up from it.
[00:10:41.692 --> 00:10:46.616]  Is this one of the most intense roles you've ever played?
[00:11:05.593 --> 00:11:06.474]  Uh, yeah, definitely.
[00:11:06.474 --> 00:11:25.833]  I mean, it is a very heavy film, but, um, you know, I think it's, uh, it's a very brave, interesting kind of film, and it works on lots of different levels, in a way, but it is, uh, it does, uh, leave you feeling a bit turned up by the end of it, so it does put you in a bit of a state of shock, almost, but it's a powerful film, yeah.
[00:11:25.833 --> 00:11:29.737]  Well, you guys talked about how it was shot to really
[00:11:31.181 --> 00:11:42.070]  Look like what light looks like to someone actually in a room, not fake Hollywood light, and I think that adds to the really creepiness of it.
[00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:46.933]  I read in the States when you said that you basically got your accent from King of the Hill and listening to my radio show.
[00:11:46.933 --> 00:11:48.855]  When did you start tuning into the show?
[00:11:48.855 --> 00:11:50.396]  That's correct, yeah.
[00:11:50.396 --> 00:11:56.141]  I needed a good source of Texas accent, and I started with
[00:11:57.745 --> 00:12:12.109]  King of the Hill and then I kind of discovered your show and it enabled me to, you know, listen to your show on the podcast and things for sort of, you know, three hours at a time every day and for a couple of months.
[00:12:12.109 --> 00:12:19.091]  So, you know, just trying to pick things up really and immerse myself in it and got into your show via that really.
[00:12:19.091 --> 00:12:21.432]  So it was a fortuitous
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.521]  Yeah, Rick's a great guy.
[00:12:23.521 --> 00:12:25.162]  I wonder what he'll think of your film.
[00:12:49.915 --> 00:12:50.996]  Yeah, I hope you see it.
[00:12:50.996 --> 00:12:55.919]  I mean, definitely there's a nod to that film for sure.
[00:12:55.919 --> 00:13:02.684]  Now, anybody can I guess go to YouTube and just type in Red White and Blue trailer and get an idea?
[00:13:02.684 --> 00:13:07.208]  Yeah, I think there's a redwhiteandbluemovie.com too.
[00:13:07.208 --> 00:13:08.989]  It's a sort of movie site and stuff.
[00:13:08.989 --> 00:13:11.250]  People can get information from there.
[00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:14.593]  I think there'll be more trailers released.
[00:13:14.593 --> 00:13:18.376]  It's definitely not a film for the kiddies, but you know,
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.602]  But I wouldn't even call this a horror film.
[00:13:23.602 --> 00:13:40.235]  I mean, this is more about different perspectives of different people who all feel right in the horrible things they're doing and really when you pull back from it, it all goes back to the root, I don't want to give anything away, of a trauma.
[00:13:40.235 --> 00:13:41.976]  Exactly.
[00:13:41.976 --> 00:13:43.257]  So is that accurate?
[00:13:43.257 --> 00:13:44.198]  Yeah, no, exactly.
[00:13:44.198 --> 00:13:48.962]  I mean, you know, on one level it's a very
[00:13:49.975 --> 00:14:19.209]  It's a very blood-soaked love story, in essence, and a revenge tale, and a very extreme version of the Western model, in a way, like a movie like Shame, or whatever, you know, someone who's sort of forced to take up violence for their own particular reason, maybe sort of being forced into it, rather than, you know, psychotic sort of slashing, sort of aimlessly going at
[00:14:19.636 --> 00:14:21.940]  And it leaves a lot of it open for your own speculation where you don't really know
[00:14:35.345 --> 00:14:37.086]  In some cases.
[00:14:37.086 --> 00:14:38.387]  I mean... Yeah.
[00:14:38.387 --> 00:14:42.669]  Is he really a former army CIA torture guy?
[00:14:42.669 --> 00:14:44.830]  Not exactly sure about that.
[00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:45.771]  I think he might have been.
[00:14:45.771 --> 00:14:46.831]  I think he might have been.
[00:14:46.831 --> 00:14:53.054]  Yeah, I don't think it's beyond the realms of possibility.
[00:14:53.054 --> 00:14:58.697]  Yeah, I mean, you know, we all know there's been some pretty nasty stuff going on around the world.
[00:14:58.697 --> 00:15:00.839]  You know, that sort of stuff goes on.
[00:15:00.839 --> 00:15:03.420]  It's not beyond the realms of possibility, but in a way it's not
[00:15:04.119 --> 00:15:13.231]  It's not necessarily important whether you believe that he's that thing or not because you know his actions kind of back up his statements in a way.
[00:15:13.231 --> 00:15:15.314]  Absolutely and you know for real
[00:15:16.388 --> 00:15:17.388]  Hardcore torture.
[00:15:17.388 --> 00:15:18.529]  That's really how they do it.
[00:15:18.529 --> 00:15:20.590]  They don't sit there and play games and screw around.
[00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:23.471]  They just... Well, I'm not going to describe the film.
[00:15:23.471 --> 00:15:25.191]  They just start chopping things off.
[00:15:25.191 --> 00:15:26.952]  Especially if they're planning to get rid of you.
[00:15:26.952 --> 00:15:29.213]  Red, white, and blue, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:29.213 --> 00:15:32.454]  Hardcore isn't even the beginning of it.
[00:15:32.454 --> 00:15:33.815]  It certainly gets you thinking.
[00:15:34.555 --> 00:15:42.241]  And then when you realize that this stuff's going on in reality all over the place by the supposed good guys, it'll certainly make your head spin.
[00:15:42.241 --> 00:15:51.889]  Okay, Noah, in the time we've got left, last night, boy, you were really going off on the police state, on the mind control, on the conditioning going on.
[00:15:51.889 --> 00:15:54.551]  Let's launch right into it.
[00:15:54.551 --> 00:16:00.576]  Alright, well, you know, I just gathered a few little notes of sort of things that are
[00:16:01.533 --> 00:16:28.004]  You know, going on in the UK and, well, I guess, you know, lots of countries around the world, but I mean, the UK stands out because they're, you know, it's the most surveilled country in the world, the most number of CCTV cameras and all that sort of stuff and, you know, people are kind of used to it, but actually it's a fairly impotent apparatus, I've come to the conclusion, because the fact is,
[00:16:28.786 --> 00:16:33.089]  At the moment, they have them installed, but there's just not enough people to watch it.
[00:16:33.089 --> 00:16:42.676]  I guess down the line, you know, the technology will be sophisticated enough it won't depend on humans, you know, sort of watching individual cameras and things like that.
[00:16:42.676 --> 00:16:53.323]  I mean, I know they're already doing that sort of, you know, mapping, you know, sort of suspicious movements or gatherings of people, things like that, but it is disturbing.
[00:16:53.323 --> 00:16:54.564]  I mean, I reread 1984 recently,
[00:16:57.276 --> 00:17:08.243]  And, you know, I remember that sort of feeling when 1984 actually came about 20-whatever years ago, and there was that sort of relief of, oh, it hasn't happened, you know.
[00:17:08.243 --> 00:17:17.770]  But actually, if you walk around England these days, it feels pretty, pretty close to it.
[00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:20.351]  Yeah, it's a funny old place.
[00:17:22.595 --> 00:17:26.080]  Yeah, and just the other thing was the smoking ban.
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:36.135]  I always saw that as a way of getting compliance out of society, sort of making them give up something incredibly treasured to them, and if you can make them do that, you can make them do crime.
[00:17:37.543 --> 00:17:52.399]  And it sets the precedent for a global sloganeering campaign, which on the surface is actually good, but it sets the precedent that we tell you what you can do and then we can tell you the type of toilets or light bulbs we can... Absolutely.
[00:17:52.399 --> 00:17:58.906]  It's always done with a good cause that no one can argue about, like a health reason or this new sort of
[00:18:00.046 --> 00:18:04.310]  You know, internet bans they're trying to put on to prevent sort of, you know, horrible pornography.
[00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:15.399]  I mean, no one's going to disagree with that in essence, but it sets up, you know, for a lot of governmental abuse when you start saying, oh, you can watch this, you can't watch that.
[00:18:15.399 --> 00:18:21.404]  You know, I mean, and those sort of things just seem to be gathering speed worldwide.
[00:18:21.404 --> 00:18:25.648]  I'm from Australia originally, and they're running away with it over there.
[00:18:25.648 --> 00:18:26.249]  So, yeah.
[00:18:29.394 --> 00:18:36.619]  Well, a good example of that is New York State is going to give you a $1,000 fine if you salt your food.
[00:18:36.619 --> 00:18:38.161]  I mean, this has actually happened.
[00:18:38.161 --> 00:18:38.741]  I read that.
[00:18:38.741 --> 00:18:40.202]  I read that the other day.
[00:18:40.202 --> 00:18:42.384]  Unbelievable.
[00:18:42.384 --> 00:18:43.565]  Unbelievable.
[00:18:43.565 --> 00:18:44.926]  But, yeah.
[00:18:44.926 --> 00:18:49.910]  But then, meanwhile, they put sodium fluoride in our water, which they admit is a deadly poison.
[00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:50.450]  Yeah.
[00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:52.972]  And sell us cigarettes.
[00:18:52.972 --> 00:18:53.372]  You know?
[00:18:53.372 --> 00:18:55.234]  I mean, it's, yeah, it's crazy.
[00:18:56.261 --> 00:19:07.209]  That one I think will be actually very hard to put through because that is really messing with, you know, a ancient human, you know, desire.
[00:19:07.209 --> 00:19:08.951]  Well, we need salt!
[00:19:08.951 --> 00:19:12.073]  I mean, we need salt.
[00:19:12.073 --> 00:19:16.316]  What about the naked body scanners?
[00:19:16.316 --> 00:19:19.098]  Naked body scanner?
[00:19:19.098 --> 00:19:21.140]  It doesn't, personally,
[00:19:22.219 --> 00:19:22.940]  Noah Taylor.
[00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:25.402]  We're going to come right back with him after this quick break.
[00:19:25.402 --> 00:19:27.703]  We'll talk more about the Naked Body Scammers.
[00:19:51.664 --> 00:19:52.125]  Everything.
[00:19:52.125 --> 00:19:53.810]  See, that's a Freudian slip.
[00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:58.421]  I call it naked body scammers because the thing is a scam to train us to submit to tyranny.
[00:19:58.421 --> 00:19:59.042]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:01.405 --> 00:20:07.089]  Lose one to two pounds a day the healthy way and keep it off with the help of the entire real HCG diet.
[00:20:07.089 --> 00:20:11.972]  With an average weight loss of one half to two pounds a day, you can be in that bikini or swimming suit in no time.
[00:20:11.972 --> 00:20:16.435]  You've heard of people spending over $700 for this exact same diet at doctor's offices?
[00:20:16.435 --> 00:20:20.198]  Now you can start the entire HCG diet for under $100.

[00:20:59.972 --> 00:21:07.637]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:21:07.637 --> 00:21:15.762]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:21:15.762 --> 00:21:21.325]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[00:21:21.665 --> 00:21:23.907]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[00:21:23.907 --> 00:21:29.011]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:21:29.011 --> 00:21:34.236]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:21:34.236 --> 00:21:38.579]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:21:38.579 --> 00:21:39.680]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:44.184]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:21:44.184 --> 00:21:45.105]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:21:49.068 --> 00:21:52.051]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:21:52.051 --> 00:21:55.954]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:55.954 --> 00:22:01.339]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.339 --> 00:22:05.343]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:22:05.343 --> 00:22:08.606]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:22:08.606 --> 00:22:10.007]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:22:10.703 --> 00:22:13.746]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:22:13.746 --> 00:22:19.772]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:22:19.772 --> 00:22:25.317]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:22:25.317 --> 00:22:34.966]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:22:35.066 --> 00:22:37.407]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:22:37.407 --> 00:22:39.008]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:22:39.008 --> 00:22:41.469]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:22:41.469 --> 00:22:43.591]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:22:43.591 --> 00:22:48.733]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:22:48.733 --> 00:22:57.858]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:59.813 --> 00:23:05.619]  Did you know there is a growing number of researchers who agree that 90% of all disease begins in the colon?
[00:23:05.619 --> 00:23:10.844]  Did you know that 80% of all Americans suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[00:23:10.844 --> 00:23:13.707]  If allowed, our bodies are capable of healing themselves.
[00:23:13.707 --> 00:23:19.473]  The key to optimal health is not only what we eat, but also a healthy digestive system and a strong immune system.
[00:23:19.693 --> 00:23:28.846]  At Freshwater Organics, we offer FPP, a daily organic supplement that helps eliminate parasites, heavy metals, and high cholesterol naturally and safely.

[00:24:04.372 --> 00:24:17.222]  Noah Taylor is our guest, Pirates of the Caribbean, Tomb Raider, the star of Max, the star of Red White and Blue, the list goes on and on.
[00:24:17.222 --> 00:24:20.885]  And he's right here with us against Big Brother.
[00:24:20.885 --> 00:24:22.426]  Not double plus good.
[00:24:22.426 --> 00:24:25.949]  Noah, you were getting into some other issues, the whole global warming thing.
[00:24:25.949 --> 00:24:29.131]  We're going to talk about Polanski and your view on what's happening.
[00:24:29.131 --> 00:24:30.072]  Let's get into that right now.
[00:24:31.411 --> 00:24:39.817]  Oh yeah, OK, I mean that's just, you know, something, I mean it's purely hysteria and it was just something that sort of occurred to me the other day really.
[00:24:39.817 --> 00:24:56.790]  I thought the Polanski thing was a little bit suspicious because obviously he's been on that charge and it's a fairly terrible charge but he's been on it for a very long time and nobody's ever really bothered to do anything about it.
[00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:59.873]  And the timing of his arrest is just a little bit suspicious because
[00:25:01.303 --> 00:25:20.898]  The subject of his latest film, Ghostwriter, is based on a book called Ghost by Robert Harris and it's a very thinly veiled version of Tony Blair and has a sort of a David Kelly, the Iraq scientist, a character based on him.
[00:25:21.903 --> 00:25:22.443]  In it.
[00:25:22.443 --> 00:25:33.690]  And it just seemed very odd that when that film came out, that was the time they chose to nab Polanski in supposedly neutral Switzerland.
[00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:42.595]  But as I say, it could be just a coincidence, as these things occasionally are, but you know, this smells a little bit funny there.
[00:25:42.595 --> 00:25:43.876]  Something rotten in Denmark, I think.
[00:25:44.497 --> 00:25:49.040]  I haven't seen the film, but obviously they killed David Kelly.
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:56.684]  The first witnesses said there were guys in black uniforms around the body before anybody supposedly found him, the wrist.
[00:25:56.684 --> 00:26:03.788]  Yes, I've heard the paramedics when they got there, there was no...
[00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:06.904]  Flash marks on the wrist.
[00:26:06.904 --> 00:26:14.699]  And also, it's very dubious that, you know, a scientist who knows about medicine and chemicals and things like that would choose to kill himself like that anyway.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:33.637]  And now they're actually trying, there's a big movement trying to get a new inquiry into it, but then they just announced the other day that the coroner's report that they have and the autopsy won't be available for public disclosure for 80 years, which is, you know, convenient.
[00:26:33.637 --> 00:26:37.461]  That'll be helpful in expediating the truth, won't it?
[00:26:37.461 --> 00:26:39.863]  Well, they've had the doctors that examined him say that the
[00:26:40.748 --> 00:26:56.677]  First the cuts weren't there, then they weren't deep enough, there was no blood at the scene, he had three undigested pills in his stomach, his body was like propped up in bushes, and he sent an email out to his colleagues saying, if I don't shut up, I'm going to be found dead in the woods.
[00:26:56.677 --> 00:26:57.638]  Yes.
[00:26:57.638 --> 00:26:59.139]  Yes.
[00:26:59.139 --> 00:27:03.801]  Yeah, it's pretty dubious.
[00:27:03.801 --> 00:27:07.403]  Global warming.
[00:27:07.403 --> 00:27:09.184]  Global warming.
[00:27:09.184 --> 00:27:09.985]  You brought that up to me.
[00:27:11.098 --> 00:27:30.243]  Oh yeah, just someone pointed out to me the other day, James Lovelock I believe is the gentleman's name, he's about 90 now, and he's the guy, the original environmentalist in a way, and he came up with the Gaia movement, which I think in essence is quite a beautiful idea and sort of makes sense in itself.
[00:27:30.243 --> 00:27:33.964]  But he's coming out now saying, actually,
[00:27:35.463 --> 00:27:44.669]  Man's contribution to, you know, greenhouse gases and things like that has actually probably prevented an ice age.
[00:27:44.669 --> 00:27:53.495]  So, in a way, he believes that it's actually stopped an ice age that traditionally has always happened, and an ice age that would last for a couple of thousand years.
[00:27:53.495 --> 00:27:58.979]  So, yeah, so, you know, it's all slowly coming out.
[00:27:58.979 --> 00:28:02.902]  I think there are cracks showing, and I think I was saying to you last night, you know,
[00:28:04.369 --> 00:28:16.133]  You know, my views differ with you on some things, but I think in essence there is light at the end of the tunnel in that historically there's never been a truly successful dictatorship.
[00:28:16.133 --> 00:28:27.997]  They might last for a couple of centuries like Rome or whatever, but once they become so powerful that everyone is so rigid with fear to make any sort of sensible decision, the fear of upsetting the
[00:28:29.184 --> 00:28:31.344]  Well, also the delusional hubris.
[00:28:31.344 --> 00:28:35.625]  Here's Karl Rove in the BBC Today, said he was proud of waterboarding.
[00:28:35.625 --> 00:28:37.126]  Proud of torturing people.
[00:28:37.126 --> 00:28:39.026]  So the new good guys are the torturers.
[00:28:39.026 --> 00:28:39.706]  Yeah, nice.
[00:28:39.706 --> 00:28:39.946]  Nice.
[00:28:39.946 --> 00:28:40.166]  Yeah.
[00:29:00.013 --> 00:29:06.497]  Um, yeah, I don't even know what to say about that, really, but yes, that's, uh... Yeah.
[00:29:06.497 --> 00:29:08.278]  Well, every tyranny has fallen.
[00:29:08.278 --> 00:29:17.904]  That's why they want this to be a scientific tyranny, where they study the past corrupt systems and try to paper it over with high-tech systems.
[00:29:17.904 --> 00:29:24.828]  But I don't see that working, because there's such an innate wish for freedom and liberty that beats in the human breast.
[00:29:26.238 --> 00:29:27.258]  Absolutely.
[00:29:27.258 --> 00:29:29.939]  I mean, in England, that's a prime example.
[00:29:29.939 --> 00:29:36.360]  And I mean, English people generally don't like to cause too much of a fuss.
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:37.180]  Noah, hold it there.
[00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:37.820]  We got a break.
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.181]  Final segment with you straight ahead.
[00:29:39.181 --> 00:29:51.483]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.483 --> 00:29:52.884]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.884 --> 00:29:54.384]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.413 --> 00:30:00.717]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.717 --> 00:30:07.362]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:30:07.362 --> 00:30:12.526]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:30:12.526 --> 00:30:21.252]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.

[00:30:29.725 --> 00:30:34.328]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:30:34.328 --> 00:30:38.151]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[00:30:38.151 --> 00:30:39.392]  Others don't.

[00:30:57.905 --> 00:30:58.786]  Others don't.
[00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:06.256]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:31:06.256 --> 00:31:09.501]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:31:09.501 --> 00:31:10.923]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:14.292]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:31:14.292 --> 00:31:20.698]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:31:20.698 --> 00:31:26.242]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:31:26.242 --> 00:31:35.870]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:38.331]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:31:38.331 --> 00:31:39.911]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:31:39.911 --> 00:31:42.372]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:31:42.372 --> 00:31:44.493]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:31:44.493 --> 00:31:49.655]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:32:39.305 --> 00:32:40.105]  This capitalism?
[00:32:40.105 --> 00:32:46.368]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:32:46.368 --> 00:32:47.248]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:32:47.248 --> 00:32:50.489]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[00:32:59.893 --> 00:33:11.461]  Noah Taylor is our guest.
[00:33:11.461 --> 00:33:12.462]  Hollywood star.
[00:33:12.462 --> 00:33:14.243]  A lot of diverse roles.
[00:33:14.243 --> 00:33:17.205]  He told me his next film is a family comedy.
[00:33:17.205 --> 00:33:21.628]  Something a bit lighter than Red White and Blue.
[00:33:21.628 --> 00:33:25.571]  Red White and Blue movie is .com I believe the website.
[00:33:25.571 --> 00:33:26.351]  Is that right Noah?
[00:33:26.351 --> 00:33:27.132]  What's the website again?
[00:33:29.654 --> 00:33:31.155]  It's redwhiteandbluemovie.com, isn't it?
[00:33:31.155 --> 00:33:35.178]  Oh yeah, no, I was just going to say, the English traditionally have a...
[00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:54.332]  You know, they're viewed as a fairly sort of compliant, polite people, which they are.
[00:33:54.332 --> 00:34:00.775]  And also they are quite used to sort of doing what the government tells them.
[00:34:00.775 --> 00:34:11.040]  But at a certain point, if you push them too far or you mess around with certain... Like one thing they'll never be able to do is sort of alter sort of drinking stuff there.
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:14.182]  If you sort of messed around with drinking there, then there would be a revolution.
[00:34:15.137 --> 00:34:18.321]  They had the poll tax about 20 years ago.
[00:34:18.321 --> 00:34:19.862]  I don't know if you know anything about that.
[00:34:19.862 --> 00:34:24.608]  But it was this very, very unfair tax.
[00:34:24.608 --> 00:34:27.010]  And people took to the streets.
[00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:31.295]  I think they were really worried they were going to storm the Bastille, as it were.
[00:34:31.295 --> 00:34:32.656]  And they had to quash that tax.
[00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:49.336]  People took to the streets, but to prove that we no longer live in a democracy, when over a million people marched against the war in Iraq, that didn't register as any sort of, you know, moratorium or anything on it.
[00:34:49.336 --> 00:34:57.440]  You know, that was like, well, OK, we can see that over a million people are against this, but that's not going to cut the mustard, you know.
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:01.522]  So all I'm saying is I think there is always hope and that you
[00:35:03.484 --> 00:35:05.745]  You know, you can't push people too far.
[00:35:05.745 --> 00:35:19.388]  You have to be really careful and obviously their methods are getting more and more sophisticated and under the guise of, you know, this is for security or this is for your health or, you know, whatever.
[00:35:19.388 --> 00:35:26.950]  But people aren't as stupid as they like to think, I think.
[00:35:27.858 --> 00:35:38.505]  Yeah, they can fool folks for a while, but once you're deep into corruption, people start to wake up, and all of this is done as the pretext to make the government the good guy and the mommy, and we're all the bad children.
[00:35:38.505 --> 00:35:49.432]  It's all about how they know best for us, and they give us this front of humanitarianism, but we know behind the scenes it's all about control and dominance.
[00:35:49.432 --> 00:35:54.316]  Are you excited about Greece getting upset about the banks ripping them off?
[00:35:54.316 --> 00:35:57.298]  Iceland just passed a law saying they're not going to pay the banks this money.
[00:35:58.318 --> 00:36:00.659]  That the people don't owe?
[00:36:00.659 --> 00:36:02.480]  I'm fascinated by it all.
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:11.383]  I find it very hard to grasp economic issues, but it's obviously plain to see that it stinks.
[00:36:11.383 --> 00:36:24.568]  And you were talking about the body scanners before, and we've just been through the swine flu business and things like that, and you've got this situation where you've got this massive worldwide recession.
[00:36:27.691 --> 00:36:44.916]  States bailing out all the banks, the banks are back to paying themselves huge bonuses, and big pharma and these sort of companies developing things like the body scanners, they're the only people really sort of making any sort of mega bucks out of it, and they're raking it in.
[00:36:44.916 --> 00:36:52.979]  It just seems like security in pharmaceuticals is, well that's where you want to invest in I guess if you want to cash in now, but
[00:36:54.641 --> 00:36:56.642]  It's crazy and it's so blatant.
[00:36:56.642 --> 00:36:59.363]  I do think people are waking up to it.
[00:36:59.363 --> 00:37:06.686]  You were also talking off air about the snitch society, how growing up in Australia the number one thing was don't be a snitch.
[00:37:06.686 --> 00:37:13.608]  That's as Americana as apple pie and baseball, but it's just a human attribute to not be a bunch of tattletale scum.
[00:37:13.608 --> 00:37:20.090]  But now they say torture, corruption, tattling, spying for petty things.
[00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:21.711]  This is the new freedom.
[00:37:22.458 --> 00:37:23.359]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:37:23.359 --> 00:37:34.089]  I mean, Australia, you know, was a, you know, started off a penal colony, all convicts, so obviously a sort of criminal class established for their own survival, basically, I guess.
[00:37:34.089 --> 00:37:44.479]  There's sort of no snitching code and it was, it sort of lived on in Australia, you know, right up to when I was a kid and even your parents would say, you know, whatever you do, you don't
[00:37:45.151 --> 00:37:45.591]  I don't think so.
[00:38:08.253 --> 00:38:11.494]  Oh, your neighbor's got a gun!
[00:38:11.494 --> 00:38:13.395]  Oh, your neighbor spanked their kid!
[00:38:13.395 --> 00:38:17.876]  Oh, now they're going to arrest you in France and England if you yell at your husband or wife!
[00:38:17.876 --> 00:38:19.397]  Take your kids!
[00:38:19.397 --> 00:38:28.359]  There was a guy recently went to jail for telling his neighbor to F off back to Scotland.
[00:38:28.359 --> 00:38:30.140]  It's not a nice thing to say, but
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:37.408]  You know, everyone's said something stupid over the fence in anger to their neighbour and hasn't gone to jail for three months for it.
[00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:48.852]  Absolutely, that's mind control where the government says, we're going to put you in jail if a little girl, and it's all selectively enforced.
[00:38:48.852 --> 00:38:54.394]  I saw this in a story out of England, five-year-olds being put on criminal list.
[00:38:54.394 --> 00:38:59.515]  And I saw another report where two-year-olds are put on probation if their parents ever committed crimes.
[00:38:59.515 --> 00:39:02.176]  They're saying, well, genetically, you must be a criminal.
[00:39:02.176 --> 00:39:03.636]  In fact, you were talking about that last night.
[00:39:04.036 --> 00:39:04.677]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:04.677 --> 00:39:17.229]  I mean, I don't know if they've actually passed it yet, but there is this talk about sort of legislating a thing where they have this thing, ASBOs, which are ridiculous in England, anti-social behaviour orders.
[00:39:17.229 --> 00:39:25.177]  And they've been talking about, yeah, profiling parents with criminal records or whatever.
[00:39:25.177 --> 00:39:27.439]  And in essence, before their child's born, they go,
[00:39:28.539 --> 00:39:42.806]  We're going to put that child on the on the sort of watch list but now you know sort of data sharing whatever I mean it's creating a criminal underclass before they're even born they don't have it you know there's no born innocent anymore do you know what I mean?
[00:39:43.666 --> 00:39:47.268]  Well, to be clear, nationally they haven't passed the law.
[00:39:47.268 --> 00:39:53.531]  Well, I agree with you, but nationally they haven't passed the law in England, but the feds in your government are funding the townships.
[00:39:53.531 --> 00:39:58.673]  The town councils have made it law locally, and so this is going on now.
[00:39:58.673 --> 00:40:01.074]  We've only got a few minutes left.
[00:40:01.074 --> 00:40:04.576]  You know, you can apply to five local councils.
[00:40:04.576 --> 00:40:11.059]  I think they have thousands of them going on now, but you can be a parking inspector or anybody, really.
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.563]  Yeah, your neighbors go through your trash!
[00:40:32.944 --> 00:40:40.090]  Well, I just wanted to add that from researching Australia, you know, you live there and you know more than I, but most of the people that were sent there were just the poor.
[00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:48.456]  You could be sent there just for having debts, literally as slaves loaded on ships and the Crown basically working people to death.
[00:40:48.456 --> 00:40:54.221]  A lot of the folks that founded the United States were brought here as criminals that were...
[00:40:54.881 --> 00:40:56.863]  Taken to the United States as a penal colony.
[00:40:56.863 --> 00:41:00.085]  Well, listen, in closing, the new film, U.S.
[00:41:00.085 --> 00:41:02.687]  premiere last night, I was honored to be there.
[00:41:02.687 --> 00:41:05.730]  Thanks to Tim League and others for inviting me there.
[00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:11.615]  It was great to meet you and a little bit of myself went into your character, though it is a very dark character.
[00:41:11.615 --> 00:41:14.037]  But we've got about two minutes left here with you, Noah.
[00:41:14.037 --> 00:41:16.499]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[00:41:16.499 --> 00:41:17.279]  Oh, not really, mate.
[00:41:17.279 --> 00:41:19.581]  It was a pleasure to meet you.
[00:41:19.581 --> 00:41:23.745]  I love what you do, and it's great being in
[00:41:24.502 --> 00:41:34.347]  Boston, I sincerely think Boston's one of the coolest towns in the world and South by Southwest, great time to be here.
[00:41:34.347 --> 00:41:41.690]  Yeah, don't know really what else to say, just keep up the good work.
[00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:46.713]  Oh, I was going to ask you actually, what's happening with that film, New World Order?
[00:41:46.713 --> 00:41:51.195]  I saw it online, but is that going to get a theatrical release?
[00:41:51.195 --> 00:41:52.716]  New World Order, actually,
[00:41:54.386 --> 00:41:58.169]  I mean, are you talking about the film last year made by C-Think?
[00:41:58.169 --> 00:41:59.130]  Yeah.
[00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:06.916]  Yeah, no, that aired on IFC on television and it did go into some theaters and actually premiered.
[00:42:06.916 --> 00:42:19.647]  It's a really good film, I think, because I think, you know, it doesn't actually sort of tackle the issues necessarily, but it sort of, I thought it was quite a sort of fair look at the movement and things.
[00:42:21.155 --> 00:42:22.095]  Absolutely.
[00:42:22.095 --> 00:42:31.858]  In closing, because you had told me to remind you, who are some of the folks you want to thank in the production, or anything else about the production of Red, White & Blue?
[00:42:31.858 --> 00:42:38.840]  Oh, just mainly our mutual friend Tim Legg who runs the Alamo Draft House and a fantastic fest in Austin.
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:43.541]  He's really contributed a lot to Austin culturally, I guess.
[00:42:43.541 --> 00:42:46.322]  I mean, Alamo's got to be one of the greatest cinemas in the world.
[00:42:46.322 --> 00:42:46.942]  You know, you can have a
[00:42:47.543 --> 00:43:04.232]  A beer and a pizza in the middle of a horror film and Tim and Carrie put us up at their house for the duration of the shoot and just to thank all the people of Austin really who let us into their homes and made it such a great experience to work here.
[00:43:04.232 --> 00:43:08.795]  Now am I correct that Tim League is an executive producer?
[00:43:08.795 --> 00:43:10.976]  That's correct, yeah.
[00:43:10.976 --> 00:43:12.837]  So now he's getting into major movie making.
[00:43:14.055 --> 00:43:18.117]  Yeah, I don't think he wants to pursue it anymore.
[00:43:18.117 --> 00:43:25.040]  I know he's already told people not to submit stuff to him, but I think it's a bit of a one-off.
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:28.542]  It is exhausting.
[00:43:28.542 --> 00:43:31.303]  Highball is his new place.
[00:43:31.303 --> 00:43:32.183]  It's pretty great.
[00:43:32.183 --> 00:43:34.745]  Bowling Alley down there.
[00:43:34.745 --> 00:43:37.726]  Watching you do Dirty Deeds karaoke, that was powerful.
[00:43:39.462 --> 00:43:46.888]  Yeah, there's another, you know, little Australian band, ACDC, so dear old Bon Scott, yeah.
[00:43:46.888 --> 00:43:54.274]  Well listen, Noah Taylor, we really appreciate you joining us and I hope to talk to you again, hopefully someday have you in studio with us.
[00:43:54.274 --> 00:43:58.377]  Thank you sir, it's been a pleasure, keep up the good work and thanks for having us on.
[00:43:58.377 --> 00:44:01.260]  Alright, God bless Noah, take care.
[00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:03.622]  There he goes ladies and gentlemen, thought I'd get him on the show.
[00:44:04.991 --> 00:44:13.158]  A little bit nervous, you could tell, getting on for the first time and talking about the police state and the New World Order, but that was a very interesting interview.
[00:44:13.158 --> 00:44:29.253]  Okay, I've got all this incredibly important news, and normally I do interviews like that at the end of the show or later in the broadcast and do news up at the front, but the time change, I thought I got home at
[00:44:30.267 --> 00:44:30.487]  I don't
[00:44:53.168 --> 00:44:54.528]  You know what happened yesterday?
[00:44:54.528 --> 00:44:57.709]  And you know, I've seen this happen on national cable news.
[00:44:57.709 --> 00:45:00.290]  I've seen this happen on local TV.
[00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:02.210]  You've all seen it.
[00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:06.312]  They had a board op yesterday up at Genesis.
[00:45:06.312 --> 00:45:09.732]  Fade up news, the news feed for 30 minutes of my show.
[00:45:09.732 --> 00:45:18.495]  So only the internet listeners out of my studio actually heard the first 30 minutes of yesterday's show.
[00:45:18.495 --> 00:45:18.975]  And, um,
[00:45:20.908 --> 00:45:32.893]  I'm tempted to go back over this fluoride story, where in Massachusetts they get this Chinese fluoride and it clogs all the machines and they're going, oh my gosh, we need to test it.
[00:45:32.893 --> 00:45:33.753]  Could it be melamine?
[00:45:33.753 --> 00:45:36.114]  Could they be mixing poison with the fluoride?
[00:45:36.114 --> 00:45:41.356]  That's like saying, could they be mixing arsenic with the cyanide?
[00:45:41.356 --> 00:45:46.859]  Or are they mixing Beelzebub with Satan?
[00:45:46.859 --> 00:45:47.519]  Are they mixing
[00:45:50.655 --> 00:45:52.496]  Red hot fire with blue fire.
[00:45:52.496 --> 00:45:56.337]  I mean, it's mind control.
[00:45:56.337 --> 00:46:11.163]  And on this newscast, they show the bags of Chinese made fluoride that says causes organ failure, bone fractures, death, incredibly deadly poison, target organs.
[00:46:11.163 --> 00:46:14.344]  And they're saying, could there be something else in here that's poisonous?
[00:46:14.344 --> 00:46:15.284]  We're so worried.
[00:46:15.284 --> 00:46:17.325]  And then on it, it says deadly poison.
[00:46:18.595 --> 00:46:21.776]  But they're worried the Chinese are mixing some other toxic waste in.
[00:46:21.776 --> 00:46:24.176]  That's the whole fluoride scam!
[00:46:24.176 --> 00:46:26.917]  It's not just fluoride.
[00:46:26.917 --> 00:46:29.697]  They're allowed to put hundreds of chemicals in with it.
[00:46:29.697 --> 00:46:30.017]  You know what?
[00:46:30.017 --> 00:46:31.678]  I'm going to redo that in the last hour.
[00:46:31.678 --> 00:46:34.098]  I'm not going to re-air what people missed.
[00:46:34.098 --> 00:46:39.019]  I'm going to cover it again in the last hour today.
[00:46:39.019 --> 00:46:41.420]  And we are going to open the phones up as well.
[00:46:43.553 --> 00:46:50.677]  On any issue you wish to discuss, any news item, any direction you want to take us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:46:50.677 --> 00:46:55.200]  As promised, for 10-15 minutes in the middle of the next hour, we've got the lady on who's really had a big effect.
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:57.421]  I'm starting to see it gain some steam.
[00:46:57.421 --> 00:47:03.245]  This national strike or protest that's going to be on the 15th of every month.
[00:47:04.246 --> 00:47:07.208]  We got her popping in to give us more details on that.
[00:47:07.208 --> 00:47:09.269]  I mean, look what it's doing over in Iceland.
[00:47:09.269 --> 00:47:12.830]  Look what it's doing over in Greece.
[00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:15.592]  This can have a big effect if you believe it can have an effect.
[00:47:15.592 --> 00:47:18.193]  Of course, they haven't been drinking sodium fluoride.
[00:47:18.193 --> 00:47:23.896]  It dumbs you down on record in Greece or in Iceland.
[00:47:23.896 --> 00:47:27.098]  I have seen articles, though, that the IMF wants to give some loans.
[00:47:28.305 --> 00:47:32.687]  To the government, and some tax incentives, and to Florida!
[00:47:32.687 --> 00:47:34.528]  Suddenly, I guess, they won't be rioting.
[00:47:34.528 --> 00:47:36.908]  They'll be, like us, chemically lobotomized.
[00:47:36.908 --> 00:47:37.709]  This is not a joke.
[00:47:37.709 --> 00:47:40.310]  This is really going on.
[00:47:40.310 --> 00:47:53.955]  You have to realize that, throughout history, evil people get away with doing bad stuff because the general public is not evil, and cannot imagine that there are people actually doing things this diabolical.
[00:47:53.955 --> 00:47:55.356]  And then I got other news like this.
[00:47:55.356 --> 00:47:57.877]  You know, it was just Friday that I spent a whole hour
[00:47:59.907 --> 00:48:09.312]  On Russian and European made helicopters all over the Texas border doing touch and goes, inserting troops.
[00:48:09.312 --> 00:48:15.915]  We've had caller after caller scared from the very towns that are now in the news admitting this is happening.
[00:48:15.915 --> 00:48:18.617]  San Antonio Express News, you name it, reporting it.
[00:48:18.617 --> 00:48:21.999]  Armed Mexican troops hanging out of their helicopters, Navy troops.
[00:48:22.879 --> 00:48:34.894]  Navy sailors with machine guns, truck bombs in Dallas, rocket attacks on newspapers, and let me tell you, when a truck bomb goes off, it's like way down in the article.
[00:48:34.894 --> 00:48:39.019]  Oh yeah, car bomb, killed some people, no big deal.
[00:48:39.019 --> 00:48:41.623]  Can you imagine if a militia
[00:48:43.277 --> 00:48:46.640]  Or if a citizen group, black, white, it doesn't matter.
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:50.624]  I mean, can you imagine if some black group set off a truck bomb?
[00:48:50.624 --> 00:48:52.987]  I mean, you'd think it was the end of the world.
[00:48:52.987 --> 00:48:54.988]  Or if a Hispanic American group did it.
[00:48:54.988 --> 00:49:07.541]  But because it's Mexico, and they don't want you to talk about the border that's open, and how they want amnesty, complete and total absolute amnesty, they have pretty much locked this story down.
[00:49:08.553 --> 00:49:28.297]  Now, I've been telling you for, I don't know, eight years, because I would actually read the State Department, warnings to their employees that Mexico was rated, depending on the year, in the top three most dangerous country in the world.
[00:49:28.297 --> 00:49:35.039]  Oh yeah, there's a few resort sectors, highly policed, highly controlled, where they keep the locals out.
[00:49:37.005 --> 00:49:44.593]  And they've even had riots in Cancun now, but that's kept quiet.
[00:49:44.593 --> 00:49:51.941]  And I've talked to a lot of people that have been down in Cancun who've witnessed riots.
[00:49:51.941 --> 00:49:56.987]  So even that area, their big cash cow that makes billions a year is starting to unravel and fall apart.
[00:49:59.090 --> 00:50:04.414]  I mean, I vacationed in Mexico and some of those areas, you know, every few years when I get time to go down there for four or five days with the family.
[00:50:04.414 --> 00:50:05.594]  I won't go now.
[00:50:05.594 --> 00:50:07.616]  There's army checkpoints.
[00:50:07.616 --> 00:50:08.816]  The people are angry.
[00:50:08.816 --> 00:50:10.478]  They hate you.
[00:50:10.478 --> 00:50:13.860]  My wife speaks Spanish and she's like, my God, you ought to hear.
[00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:14.440]  You walk over.
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:16.101]  Oh, yes, I'd like two Cokes, please.
[00:50:16.101 --> 00:50:16.402]  Thank you.
[00:50:16.402 --> 00:50:17.562]  Here's a tip.
[00:50:17.562 --> 00:50:19.624]  And it's these degenerate gringos scum.
[00:50:19.624 --> 00:50:21.045]  We can't wait to take their country over.
[00:50:21.045 --> 00:50:22.405]  Look at this ugly fat filth.
[00:50:22.405 --> 00:50:22.666]  Yes.
[00:50:24.116 --> 00:50:25.978]  And my wife speaks fluent Spanish.
[00:50:25.978 --> 00:50:27.860]  I mean, we just can't go to your country.
[00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:30.762]  I mean, we're hearing what scum and filth and trash we are.
[00:50:30.762 --> 00:50:33.585]  Look, I'm sorry you've got a dictatorship down there.
[00:50:33.585 --> 00:50:35.146]  I'm sorry it's corrupt.
[00:50:35.146 --> 00:50:36.427]  I know our country's exploited you.
[00:50:36.427 --> 00:50:37.268]  They're exploiting us.
[00:50:37.268 --> 00:50:39.430]  It's the banks.
[00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:40.451]  But here it is.
[00:50:40.451 --> 00:50:40.932]  Reuters.
[00:50:40.932 --> 00:50:43.674]  Mexico gum and kill American consulate staff.
[00:50:43.674 --> 00:50:45.015]  I mean, look.
[00:50:45.015 --> 00:50:46.637]  This is finally coming out in the news.
[00:50:49.574 --> 00:50:51.677]  Mexico has officially collapsed, just in case.
[00:50:51.677 --> 00:50:53.360]  It's just a lawless criminal state.
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:55.904]  And our country's gonna collapse like this, too.
[00:50:55.904 --> 00:50:56.846]  Guaranteed.
[00:50:56.846 --> 00:50:57.226]  Guaranteed.
[00:50:57.226 --> 00:50:58.028]  I'll talk about it when we come back.

[00:52:02.233 --> 00:52:06.259]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:06.259 --> 00:52:09.504]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:09.504 --> 00:52:10.926]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:14.292]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:14.292 --> 00:52:20.698]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.698 --> 00:52:25.882]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:25.882 --> 00:52:35.890]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:38.332]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:38.332 --> 00:52:39.913]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:39.913 --> 00:52:42.374]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:42.374 --> 00:52:44.256]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:44.256 --> 00:52:49.659]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:53:47.466 --> 00:53:48.226]  We're good to go.
[00:54:23.222 --> 00:54:26.204]  Baby, baby.
[00:54:26.204 --> 00:54:31.288]  Some smooth music from Craig White.
[00:54:31.288 --> 00:54:33.689]  It's hard to turn this down.
[00:54:33.689 --> 00:54:37.332]  I kinda want to let it roll.
[00:54:37.332 --> 00:54:41.936]  Baby, baby.
[00:54:41.936 --> 00:54:45.298]  I like the covers they do of Led Zeppelin.
[00:54:45.298 --> 00:54:46.059]  Almost better.
[00:54:48.916 --> 00:54:51.756]  We're good to go.
[00:55:19.236 --> 00:55:24.860]  Oh, I know your heart's just like mine.
[00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:25.301]  Oh, no.
[00:55:48.041 --> 00:55:58.709]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[00:55:58.709 --> 00:56:01.891]  I can't even stand to get into this place.
[00:56:01.891 --> 00:56:05.133]  So sad that we're right.
[00:56:05.133 --> 00:56:06.074]  I wish I was wrong.
[00:56:08.837 --> 00:56:26.371]  We had a Texas state senator on a year ago, it came out in the Houston papers, came out in the San Antonio and Austin papers, about a week after we had him on, that martial law has been covertly declared on the Texas-Mexico border by the United States.
[00:56:26.371 --> 00:56:31.656]  And you've got, secretly with Rick Perry, and you've got
[00:56:33.115 --> 00:56:46.442]  Mexican troops running around on both sides of the border, killing citizens, killing cops, robbing sheriff's deputies at gunpoint, in uniform, in their Humvees, and it's maybe in the local paper when it happens.
[00:56:46.442 --> 00:56:53.145]  We have to get the sheriffs on here after they report it, just to get attention, and then it comes out in the mainstream media.
[00:56:53.145 --> 00:56:55.306]  They will not cover it.
[00:56:55.306 --> 00:56:57.247]  And now they're attacking the U.S.
[00:56:57.247 --> 00:56:58.468]  Embassy.
[00:56:58.468 --> 00:56:59.709]  I mean, can you imagine
[00:57:01.226 --> 00:57:04.087]  If Al-Cieda attacked a U.S.
[00:57:04.087 --> 00:57:06.508]  Embassy, can you imagine that they'd start a new war?
[00:57:06.508 --> 00:57:07.849]  They'd invade Iran.
[00:57:07.849 --> 00:57:10.670]  Even though Iran's Shiite run and isn't Al-Qaeda.
[00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:12.050]  It's the opposite Muslim group.
[00:57:12.050 --> 00:57:16.432]  They hate each other more than anybody.
[00:57:16.432 --> 00:57:18.433]  Doesn't matter.
[00:57:18.433 --> 00:57:19.493]  Facts don't matter.
[00:57:19.493 --> 00:57:21.694]  And let me tell you something right now.
[00:57:21.694 --> 00:57:26.716]  The United States is going to collapse, just like Mexico, if we don't decriminalize drugs.
[00:57:26.716 --> 00:57:29.117]  The British brought down China
[00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:37.794]  What was that, 150 plus years ago?
[00:57:37.794 --> 00:57:46.105]  By going in with opium, the Chinese government said opium was illegal, sounded reasonable, we don't want a bunch of drug addicts laying around.
[00:57:46.105 --> 00:57:52.214]  But by making it illegal, it made it extremely expensive, and so then they could fund big
[00:57:53.936 --> 00:58:07.061]  Criminal networks with it, and the British intelligence took over city after city, first the port towns, then the cities inland, and then they broke the country up in more than 10 pieces.
[00:58:07.061 --> 00:58:11.302]  And Western mercenary powers went in and ran it.
[00:58:11.302 --> 00:58:19.545]  And then they decided, later after the Boxer Rebellion, you know, they funded right-wingers and people, and then they kicked them out and put the communists in.
[00:58:19.545 --> 00:58:20.385]  Our government did that.
[00:58:20.385 --> 00:58:21.446]  It's now been declassified.
[00:58:21.446 --> 00:58:22.166]  Put the commies in.
[00:58:23.919 --> 00:58:30.063]  But the point is, Mexico's collapsing because of the drug war, and some other reasons.
[00:58:30.063 --> 00:58:34.006]  And if we don't end the corruption in this country, we're going to collapse.
[00:58:34.006 --> 00:58:37.529]  Because, well, I'm going to explain it when we come back, then we're going to go to your phone calls.
[00:58:37.529 --> 00:58:43.633]  Mexico, gunman kill, American consulate stay.
[00:58:43.633 --> 00:58:46.135]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:51.747 --> 00:58:55.769]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:58:55.769 --> 00:58:58.990]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:58:58.990 --> 00:59:03.792]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:59:03.792 --> 00:59:10.194]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:59:10.194 --> 00:59:12.435]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:59:12.975 --> 00:59:13.275]  Tim Geithner?
[00:59:13.275 --> 00:59:13.775]  Bernanke?
[00:59:13.775 --> 00:59:14.575]  They're arsonists!
[00:59:14.575 --> 00:59:15.736]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:59:15.736 --> 00:59:17.976]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:34.001]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:59:34.001 --> 00:59:39.143]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:59:39.143 --> 00:59:54.230]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:56.611]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.611 --> 00:59:59.392]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.956 --> 01:00:07.257]  Big Brother.
[01:00:07.257 --> 01:00:09.038]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:09.038 --> 01:00:10.779]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.779 --> 01:00:12.381]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.381 --> 01:00:13.281]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.281 --> 01:00:18.125]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.125 --> 01:00:27.812]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.812 --> 01:00:28.872]  It's very simple.
[01:00:28.872 --> 01:00:31.775]  When the CIA wanted to begin taking this nation over,
[01:00:33.243 --> 01:00:40.066]  The private intelligence network at Yale, before it was even known as the CIA, they made drugs illegal.
[01:00:40.066 --> 01:00:43.487]  Any moron could go buy cocaine, Coca-Cola.
[01:00:43.487 --> 01:00:46.208]  You could drink it till you had a heart attack if you wanted to.
[01:00:46.208 --> 01:00:48.349]  It was in Dr. Pepper, you name it.
[01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:54.732]  Any fool could go in and buy all the opium or heroin they wanted, the laudanum, and drink themselves to death.
[01:00:54.732 --> 01:01:00.434]  But statistically, a lot less people use drugs because they knew it was bad news.
[01:01:02.466 --> 01:01:03.546]  It was called snake oil.
[01:01:03.546 --> 01:01:08.027]  You got a toothache, you're depressed, your baby's crying too much.
[01:01:08.027 --> 01:01:14.669]  Millions of children over the last 100 plus years, if you read the history books, you know, even the 1700s, 1800s.
[01:01:14.669 --> 01:01:16.390]  Oh, your kid's crying too much?
[01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:17.350]  Just give them laudanum.
[01:01:17.350 --> 01:01:23.251]  That's why you see photographs from the 1840s, 50s, 60s, 70s, especially wealthy families.
[01:01:23.251 --> 01:01:28.453]  The kids have big black circles and look like zombies in some of the photos because they were on opiates.
[01:01:28.453 --> 01:01:29.413]  They were on poppy.
[01:01:31.186 --> 01:01:33.047]  Poppy derivatives.
[01:01:33.047 --> 01:01:49.394]  But, then the big families that had a monopoly bringing that in, some of the wealthiest families in this country, the Roosevelt's, Teddy Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt, they made their big family fortune off of it.
[01:01:49.394 --> 01:01:51.254]  Many other families did as well.
[01:01:51.254 --> 01:01:53.115]  They said, look, we're just going to make this illegal.
[01:01:53.115 --> 01:01:54.636]  We just got rid of alcohol prohibition.
[01:01:54.636 --> 01:01:57.157]  We were getting payoffs for that from the mob.
[01:01:57.157 --> 01:01:58.017]  We got to have something new.
[01:01:58.017 --> 01:01:59.118]  Well, we'll make this illegal.
[01:02:00.239 --> 01:02:08.107]  And then we'll keep shipping it in, and then we'll interdict people that are shipping it in who don't pay us a cut, and we'll keep the price high that way.
[01:02:08.107 --> 01:02:11.150]  And that's how they corrupted the police and took over our society.
[01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:12.251]  Same thing in Mexico.
[01:02:14.113 --> 01:02:16.274]  And Mexico has officially collapsed.
[01:02:16.274 --> 01:02:19.276]  I mean, you've got armored government facilities.
[01:02:19.276 --> 01:02:22.959]  There's riots in almost all their cities every week.
[01:02:22.959 --> 01:02:28.462]  There's lawlessness, murder, crime of all types is exploding because nothing can be enforced.
[01:02:28.462 --> 01:02:30.644]  The prisons are all full.
[01:02:30.644 --> 01:02:38.549]  And the police are so corrupt that if they do go out and even make another rival drug gang mad, they'll just kill them.
[01:02:41.277 --> 01:02:50.867]  And what's happening is the CIA and the Mexican government are getting their butt kicked on many levels by cartels down there, smaller cartels, and there's literally hundreds of them who just don't care.
[01:02:50.867 --> 01:02:53.109]  I mean, these people are macho.
[01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:54.090]  They're tough.
[01:02:54.090 --> 01:02:54.991]  They're ready to die.
[01:02:54.991 --> 01:02:57.834]  A lot of them are into weird voodoo.
[01:02:57.834 --> 01:02:59.836]  That came out in Texas Monthly decades ago.
[01:03:00.436 --> 01:03:08.421]  Hundreds of dead bodies they dig up in Matamoros and other areas and weird satanic ceremonies that the Mexican Mafia is involved in.
[01:03:08.421 --> 01:03:10.443]  I mean, these people are off the hook.
[01:03:10.443 --> 01:03:13.144]  They are unhinged.
[01:03:13.144 --> 01:03:20.069]  And they're just as tough and mean and crazy as the CIA and the Mexican government.
[01:03:20.069 --> 01:03:24.692]  And it's just going to get crazier and crazier and crazier.
[01:03:24.692 --> 01:03:28.534]  And you decriminalize drugs, it's all over for these people.
[01:03:28.534 --> 01:03:29.375]  But they're not going to.
[01:03:30.350 --> 01:03:35.262]  They're going to collapse society before they ever stop it.
[01:03:35.262 --> 01:03:39.673]  And here's Reuters, Mexico gunman kill American consulate staff.
[01:03:41.889 --> 01:03:51.476]  When we come back I'm going to finish up with this and go to your calls and break down how this corruption has taken over our country and how it's almost getting to the too late point.
[01:03:51.476 --> 01:03:53.798]  It's almost getting past midnight here.
[01:03:53.798 --> 01:03:57.280]  We're a couple seconds from midnight right now and there is some good news.
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:58.921]  People are decrying the drug war.
[01:03:58.921 --> 01:04:01.043]  They are exposing it.
[01:04:01.043 --> 01:04:03.705]  But of course the drug dealers don't want this stuff decriminalized.
[01:04:04.272 --> 01:04:05.813]  Of course they don't!
[01:04:05.813 --> 01:04:07.774]  Because this is how they control society.
[01:04:07.774 --> 01:04:09.475]  This is how they corrupt the police.
[01:04:09.475 --> 01:04:12.057]  This is how the feds have an excuse to spy on everybody.
[01:04:12.057 --> 01:04:18.561]  They built up the whole Pentagon snooping system from the 80s with the drug war when they really expanded it.
[01:04:18.561 --> 01:04:25.125]  And that's how they got the camel's nose under the tent flap of getting the military on our streets and working with the police.
[01:04:25.125 --> 01:04:30.369]  And now the camel isn't outside the tent, he's inside the tent and we're outside the tent freezing our butts off.
[01:04:32.446 --> 01:04:35.487]  Another way to beat these people is do not use drugs.
[01:04:35.487 --> 01:04:39.228]  Unless it's medicinal, like marijuana, you got cancer, glaucoma.
[01:04:39.228 --> 01:04:47.829]  I mean, don't ever use heroin, don't ever use cocaine, don't ever use the Prozac, Ritalin, all the legal stuff they push, prescription.
[01:04:47.829 --> 01:04:50.510]  Never start it to young people.
[01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:54.871]  It's cool to never use it.
[01:04:54.871 --> 01:04:58.392]  Alcohol's very addicting, folks, never start drinking.
[01:04:58.392 --> 01:04:58.952]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:02.421 --> 01:05:06.382]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:06.382 --> 01:05:15.243]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:05:15.243 --> 01:05:19.864]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:05:19.864 --> 01:05:30.686]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:05:31.326 --> 01:05:40.828]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:40.828 --> 01:05:46.270]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:05:46.270 --> 01:05:53.751]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:53.751 --> 01:05:56.492]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:06:00.302 --> 01:06:04.864]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:04.864 --> 01:06:05.765]  Number one.
[01:06:05.765 --> 01:06:09.186]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:09.186 --> 01:06:10.047]  Number two.
[01:06:10.047 --> 01:06:14.949]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:14.949 --> 01:06:15.690]  It's true.
[01:06:15.690 --> 01:06:20.232]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:20.552 --> 01:06:21.373]  Number 3.
[01:06:21.373 --> 01:06:24.956]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:24.956 --> 01:06:28.880]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:29.680]  Number 4.
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:32.443]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:32.443 --> 01:06:36.126]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:36.126 --> 01:06:36.907]  Number 5.
[01:06:36.907 --> 01:06:41.051]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:41.051 --> 01:06:45.835]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:06:46.095 --> 01:06:50.282]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:50.282 --> 01:06:52.065]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:52.065 --> 01:06:54.329]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[01:07:10.629 --> 01:07:13.111]  Then you think to yourself, I don't drink tea!
[01:07:13.111 --> 01:07:14.211]  Now for the truth.
[01:07:14.211 --> 01:07:21.915]  Many people don't drink tea, but they drink energy drinks, colas, juices from concentrates, which all carry high levels of sugar and caffeine.
[01:07:21.915 --> 01:07:22.155]  Sugar.
[01:07:22.575 --> 01:07:23.476]  It's a toxin.
[01:07:23.476 --> 01:07:25.998]  Sugar does not help you, nor does caffeine.
[01:07:25.998 --> 01:07:29.581]  Your colon could be clogged, causing dangerous consequences.
[01:07:29.581 --> 01:07:32.483]  This is why GetTheTea.com will help.

[01:07:49.918 --> 01:07:51.159]  We are back live
[01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:25.473]  So, martial law has been secretly declared by the federal government of the state of Texas a year ago.
[01:08:25.473 --> 01:08:32.636]  There are Mexican helicopters, Russian and European made, flying around all over.
[01:08:32.636 --> 01:08:36.377]  They're shooting and killing people, attacking police, robbing them.
[01:08:36.377 --> 01:08:39.679]  And it's in all the little local papers down in South Texas.
[01:08:39.679 --> 01:08:41.039]  There is a huge exodus.
[01:08:41.039 --> 01:08:42.880]  Many cities are ghost towns down there.
[01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:48.723]  Some of the larger cities, the news has reported, have lost upwards of half their population.
[01:08:48.723 --> 01:08:54.007]  It's boarded up and it's just moving now into the rest of the country.
[01:08:54.007 --> 01:08:58.430]  Different elements of Mexican drug cartels and mafia, some U.S.
[01:08:58.430 --> 01:09:04.835]  government backed, are battling with other drug cartels.
[01:09:04.835 --> 01:09:09.759]  Meanwhile, Reuters, Mexico gunman kills American consulate staff.
[01:09:09.759 --> 01:09:13.702]  Reuters, gunman in the drug war plagued Mexico City.
[01:09:16.294 --> 01:09:20.859]  Killed two Americans and a Mexican linked to the local U.S.
[01:09:20.859 --> 01:09:21.500]  consulate.
[01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:22.381]  An attack U.S.
[01:09:22.381 --> 01:09:28.508]  President Barack Obama said outraged him.
[01:09:28.508 --> 01:09:31.551]  That happened down in Juarez.
[01:09:31.551 --> 01:09:33.574]  An American woman working at the consulate.
[01:09:34.551 --> 01:09:38.995]  Just over the border from El Paso, Texas, and her U.S.
[01:09:38.995 --> 01:09:48.204]  husband were fatally shot by suspected drug gang hit men in broad daylight on Saturday as they left a consulate social event, U.S.
[01:09:48.204 --> 01:09:50.346]  and Mexican officials told Reuters.
[01:09:50.346 --> 01:09:51.708]  And that's what happens.
[01:09:51.708 --> 01:09:55.251]  If the police won't take drug payoffs, they just kill them.
[01:09:55.251 --> 01:09:56.853]  They kill their families.
[01:09:56.853 --> 01:09:57.553]  They torture them.
[01:09:58.474 --> 01:10:09.803]  Or even if police do take drug payoffs, another group will come in and say, you will take our payoffs and we'll bust this other group or we're going to kill you.
[01:10:09.803 --> 01:10:14.647]  Meanwhile, again, this is usually hidden in the news and they tell all the stupid Americans, oh, go ahead and go to Mexico.
[01:10:14.647 --> 01:10:16.789]  Oh, come on down.
[01:10:16.789 --> 01:10:17.530]  Come on down.
[01:10:17.530 --> 01:10:21.833]  And sure, I guess there's some areas that are remote and that aren't a problem.
[01:10:21.833 --> 01:10:24.996]  I guess in Baja where Ventura lives part of the year.
[01:10:24.996 --> 01:10:26.277]  But it is imploding.
[01:10:26.277 --> 01:10:27.638]  It is falling apart.
[01:10:30.365 --> 01:10:38.069]  A Mexican man married to another consul employee was killed around the same time in another part of the city after he and his wife left the same event, a U.S.
[01:10:38.069 --> 01:10:39.109]  official said.
[01:10:39.109 --> 01:10:41.790]  So they are killing a bunch of people from the embassy.
[01:10:41.790 --> 01:10:42.130]  The U.S.
[01:10:42.130 --> 01:10:48.673]  official, who has not to be identified, said it was not clear if the victims had been specifically targeted and the motive for the attacks was unknown.
[01:10:48.673 --> 01:10:50.314]  Give me a break.
[01:10:50.314 --> 01:10:56.177]  Bloodshed has exploded in recent months as the head of the Juarez cartel, Vincent Carlos
[01:10:57.418 --> 01:11:11.663]  Fuentes fights off a bloody offensive by Mexico's number one fugitive drug lord, Shorty Guzman, at the worst hotspot of Mexico's three-year-old drug war.
[01:11:11.663 --> 01:11:12.764]  And it's an actual war!
[01:11:13.854 --> 01:11:20.878]  The President is deeply saddened and outraged by the news, said White House National Security Council spokesman Mike Hammer.
[01:11:20.878 --> 01:11:30.864]  He said Obama shares in the outrage of the Mexican people at the murders of thousands in that city alone and elsewhere in Mexico.
[01:11:30.864 --> 01:11:31.284]  The U.S.
[01:11:31.284 --> 01:11:35.707]  State Department updated its warning on travel to Mexico to say it had authorized the departure.
[01:11:37.324 --> 01:11:38.805]  of dependence of U.S.
[01:11:38.805 --> 01:11:44.669]  government personnel from consulants in Juarez and five other northern border cities.
[01:11:44.669 --> 01:11:47.892]  Nearly 19,000 people have been killed.
[01:11:47.892 --> 01:11:48.272]  19,000!
[01:11:48.272 --> 01:11:53.356]  Since President Felipe Calderon came to power in Mexico in late 2006.
[01:11:53.356 --> 01:12:03.583]  And we had a lot of guests on, like Celica Stillo, former DEA agent and others, saying a big war was about to be started with the CIA trying to knock out its competition down there.
[01:12:03.583 --> 01:12:04.524]  And you're seeing the war.
[01:12:06.343 --> 01:12:12.925]  And the Cowboys, the people that aren't part of the New World Order, but they're just as bad, they're saying, hey, we're going to fight.
[01:12:12.925 --> 01:12:13.546]  You want to fight?
[01:12:13.546 --> 01:12:15.306]  Let's do it.
[01:12:15.306 --> 01:12:17.327]  Nearly 19,000 people have been killed.
[01:12:17.327 --> 01:12:18.127]  That's 19,000!
[01:12:18.127 --> 01:12:22.689]  I mean, Vietnam went on for, what, eight, nine years and killed 58,000.
[01:12:22.689 --> 01:12:25.730]  I mean, I guess in three years it's 19,000.
[01:12:25.730 --> 01:12:33.092]  That means you'll have as many dead in four or five years from now as died in Vietnam down there.
[01:12:33.092 --> 01:12:35.033]  I mean, boy, that's a full-scale war, isn't it?
[01:12:37.003 --> 01:12:52.706]  Nearly 19,000 people have been killed since President Felipe Calderón came to power in Mexico in the late 2006 and launched a military assault on the country's powerful drug cartels, sparking a surge in violence that has alarmed Washington, foreign investors, and tourists.
[01:12:52.706 --> 01:13:00.068]  Most victims are rival traffickers and police, and to a lesser extent, soldiers, local officials, and bystanders.
[01:13:00.068 --> 01:13:03.888]  It is rare for drug gang hitmen to target foreigners.
[01:13:03.888 --> 01:13:04.649]  No, it's not.
[01:13:04.649 --> 01:13:06.149]  They're killing people all over the U.S.
[01:13:07.045 --> 01:13:08.246]  They just kind of sweep it under the rug.
[01:13:08.246 --> 01:13:09.666]  Don't worry about that.
[01:13:09.666 --> 01:13:10.647]  Gotta keep the borders open.
[01:13:10.647 --> 01:13:11.687]  Mexico's great.
[01:13:11.687 --> 01:13:13.028]  Didn't Afton get good for you?
[01:13:13.028 --> 01:13:14.048]  You're losing your job?
[01:13:14.048 --> 01:13:16.609]  Oh, Detroit's gonna bulldoze a third of the city?
[01:13:16.609 --> 01:13:18.950]  Oh, half the public in Detroit are unemployed?
[01:13:18.950 --> 01:13:20.711]  Oh, other cities falling apart?
[01:13:20.711 --> 01:13:21.332]  Isn't this great?
[01:13:21.332 --> 01:13:22.212]  Isn't this good?
[01:13:22.212 --> 01:13:26.554]  To merge with a horrible, imploding third world country, North American Union.
[01:13:26.554 --> 01:13:27.254]  Isn't it fun?
[01:13:27.254 --> 01:13:29.615]  Don't you love the fruits of globalization?
[01:13:29.615 --> 01:13:30.216]  Isn't it good?
[01:13:31.448 --> 01:13:36.709]  We've got a plan to legalize all the illegals and merge us with Mexico with a new national worker ID card.
[01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:39.650]  Isn't it good?
[01:13:39.650 --> 01:13:43.210]  How dare you people, the Southern Poverty Law Center says, criticize the open border.
[01:13:43.210 --> 01:13:46.651]  You people are crazy!
[01:13:46.651 --> 01:13:52.292]  The Mexican authorities are determined to clarify what happened and bring those responsible to justice.
[01:13:52.292 --> 01:13:58.213]  The Mexican Foreign Ministry said of Saturday's attacks, children survive shooting.
[01:13:59.824 --> 01:14:00.644]  The attack on a U.S.
[01:14:00.644 --> 01:14:06.506]  couple began with a car chase and ended in front of the main border crossing in El Paso.
[01:14:06.506 --> 01:14:08.586]  An area heavily patrolled by soldiers.
[01:14:08.586 --> 01:14:09.146]  Didn't matter.
[01:14:09.146 --> 01:14:12.927]  Because what do the soldiers do when the fighting starts?
[01:14:12.927 --> 01:14:15.188]  They run and hide most of the time.
[01:14:15.188 --> 01:14:17.828]  Which is what police will do in a corrupt system.
[01:14:17.828 --> 01:14:20.749]  They will go and they will hide because they don't want to die.
[01:14:21.630 --> 01:14:24.892]  Then they'll get together and do a raid on where they think the drug dealers are at.
[01:14:24.892 --> 01:14:26.613]  Then they'll have a shootout.
[01:14:26.613 --> 01:14:35.319]  If they kill any of the drug dealers, then they'll get the names of the military squad and start killing their family, if it takes five years to do it.
[01:14:35.319 --> 01:14:38.321]  Tit for tat, like Sicily.
[01:14:38.321 --> 01:14:40.883]  And it's going to get worse and worse.
[01:14:40.883 --> 01:14:47.728]  And you know, some of the most dangerous mafia in the world, the most vicious, the most cutthroat, is the Russian mob.
[01:14:47.728 --> 01:14:49.269]  But statistically, the Mexican
[01:14:50.427 --> 01:14:54.490]  Cartels are even worse!
[01:14:54.490 --> 01:15:02.236]  See, that's why cops like to pull over a family or a group of blue hairs and ransack your car, take money out of your wallet.
[01:15:02.236 --> 01:15:03.917]  That's happening all over the U.S., all over the news.
[01:15:03.917 --> 01:15:04.878]  I know you've seen it.
[01:15:04.878 --> 01:15:08.361]  Because we're just gullible cowards.
[01:15:08.361 --> 01:15:09.162]  Oh, there's an American!
[01:15:09.162 --> 01:15:11.764]  Let me go suck off him!
[01:15:11.764 --> 01:15:13.185]  But in many U.S.
[01:15:13.185 --> 01:15:17.108]  cities, I've seen articles in Chicago, the police wanted to mex with the Mexican mafia up there.
[01:15:18.183 --> 01:15:19.604]  Because they'll just kill them!
[01:15:19.604 --> 01:15:20.945]  So, in the U.S.
[01:15:20.945 --> 01:15:24.889]  the police just say, leave them alone, let them do what they want.
[01:15:24.889 --> 01:15:28.512]  Well, that's only going to work so long as they gain power.
[01:15:28.512 --> 01:15:34.176]  And then we're going to have these killings going on.
[01:15:34.176 --> 01:15:44.565]  And our police will stick their tails between their legs and stick a thumb in their mouth and suck, suck their thumb, and go out and find weak Americans to push around.
[01:15:44.565 --> 01:15:45.386]  That's how this works.
[01:15:47.708 --> 01:15:51.090]  That's how they operate.
[01:15:51.090 --> 01:15:58.576]  Every week I hear about Mexican gangs killing old ladies in Austin, murdering people in their initiations.
[01:15:58.576 --> 01:15:59.416]  It's like L.A.
[01:15:59.416 --> 01:16:00.757]  in the 80s or something here.
[01:16:00.757 --> 01:16:03.119]  They just keep it real quiet.
[01:16:03.119 --> 01:16:05.901]  Oh, can't arrest them, can't throw the book at them.
[01:16:05.901 --> 01:16:07.002]  Oh, let's leave them alone.
[01:16:07.002 --> 01:16:08.683]  Hey, can't ask for their IDs.
[01:16:08.683 --> 01:16:09.043]  Whoa.
[01:16:10.024 --> 01:16:11.826]  Let them kill whoever they want.
[01:16:11.826 --> 01:16:17.771]  And so my city has to fall to this and the rapes and the robberies and the looting and the killing.
[01:16:17.771 --> 01:16:22.896]  And of course in the Hispanic areas of Austin, that's really where they feed on people.
[01:16:22.896 --> 01:16:25.298]  They just do whatever they want to those poor Hispanics.
[01:16:27.264 --> 01:16:34.306]  Just like Chinatown in San Francisco or New York, where the Asian mob feeds on their own people.
[01:16:34.306 --> 01:16:38.928]  They're the worst affected by this, and people are afraid to speak out, afraid to say anything.
[01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:44.870]  Better not, they'll kill you!
[01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:50.592]  But out of sight, out of mind, if the media tells us it's not a problem, must not be, right?
[01:16:50.592 --> 01:16:52.513]  And this is how societies collapse.
[01:16:55.143 --> 01:17:02.805]  Oh, they've got IRS agents in Sacramento to go to a car wash that didn't pay a four cent thing on their taxes.
[01:17:02.805 --> 01:17:04.185]  Probably isn't even true.
[01:17:04.185 --> 01:17:07.786]  They just say, you miscalculated in 2006 for four cents.
[01:17:07.786 --> 01:17:08.726]  You owe us $202.
[01:17:08.726 --> 01:17:17.888]  Two guys in suits threatening the car wash that's in the Sacramento being rude to them and aggressive, according to the car wash owner.
[01:17:17.888 --> 01:17:20.269]  By the way, I want to get them on.
[01:17:20.269 --> 01:17:20.929]  Car wash owner.
[01:17:22.722 --> 01:17:30.185]  I want to get that car wash owner on to the Sacramento Bee over the four cents.
[01:17:30.185 --> 01:17:31.306]  He at least is speaking out.
[01:17:31.306 --> 01:17:37.708]  Most Americans, I hope it or not, tell the newspaper about them coming and threatening me and being rude and very aggressive.
[01:17:37.708 --> 01:17:41.930]  I read his quote yesterday on air, but you can go pull up the actual quote if you want to read it.
[01:17:43.385 --> 01:17:44.965]  Most Americans on it are not saying anything.
[01:17:44.965 --> 01:17:47.866]  They came in my office and screamed at me over four cents.
[01:17:47.866 --> 01:17:53.527]  And again, they have all the enforcement, almost all the enforcement is on blue collar or small businesses.
[01:17:53.527 --> 01:17:57.808]  Almost none of it is on big corporations and banks because they run the regulators.
[01:17:57.808 --> 01:18:03.550]  So again, we have a mafia run, just a bunch of different crime syndicates running every facet of society.
[01:18:03.550 --> 01:18:10.692]  Here in Austin, they have the city council going back over 20 years, just takes whoever's property they want, farms, ranch land.
[01:18:10.692 --> 01:18:11.872]  No, you can't build on it.
[01:18:12.657 --> 01:18:18.078]  But they still keep your property taxes up, and then come to you five years later, we'll pay you five cents on the dollar for it.
[01:18:18.078 --> 01:18:19.698]  We'll give you an offer you can't refuse.
[01:18:19.698 --> 01:18:22.419]  Then they turn around, take the building restrictions off.
[01:18:22.419 --> 01:18:29.360]  You have former city officials openly own banks, and years after they're out of the city council, that then get all the deals.
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:33.921]  I mean, literally, we have former city officials who own the property they took from people.
[01:18:33.921 --> 01:18:36.482]  I mean, it's just absolute lordship.
[01:18:36.482 --> 01:18:42.183]  Just absolute, whatever they want, they just do it, and that's the way it is, and if you don't like it, a SWAT team will drop by.
[01:18:45.418 --> 01:18:46.939]  If you don't like it, we'll shove a gun in your face.
[01:18:46.939 --> 01:18:49.501]  We'll put you in a prison.
[01:18:49.501 --> 01:18:54.065]  What, they've had 30-something people in the last decade die in the Austin jail hanging themselves?
[01:18:54.065 --> 01:18:56.026]  If you don't like it, we'll just take you to jail and kill you.
[01:18:56.026 --> 01:18:57.327]  How's that sound?
[01:18:57.327 --> 01:18:58.128]  We run this town.
[01:18:58.128 --> 01:18:58.708]  You understand?
[01:18:58.708 --> 01:18:59.909]  You work for us.
[01:18:59.909 --> 01:19:00.610]  You're scum.
[01:19:00.610 --> 01:19:01.351]  You're trash.
[01:19:01.351 --> 01:19:02.331]  We own you.
[01:19:02.331 --> 01:19:06.455]  Period.
[01:19:06.455 --> 01:19:08.516]  And it's going to get worse and worse and worse.
[01:19:08.516 --> 01:19:14.261]  Just hundreds and hundreds of different crimes and scams and interlocking syndicates robbing everyone.
[01:19:15.089 --> 01:19:17.091]  At every level, and they're just getting started.
[01:19:17.091 --> 01:19:17.891]  Why not?
[01:19:17.891 --> 01:19:27.520]  You're busy watching television, you're busy partying with your friends, you don't see yourself as a leader, and so you're just going to go along with it because it's not as bad as Alex says.
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:39.270]  Let them tax salt, let them put me in prison for salting my food, let them put taxes on sugar, let them put taxes on food, let them inspect our houses, let them arrest us for light bulbs or batteries.
[01:19:40.748 --> 01:19:42.469]  Let them train our kids to tattle on us.
[01:19:42.469 --> 01:19:46.671]  Let them put cameras in the toilets and cameras in the laptops watching us.
[01:19:46.671 --> 01:19:48.272]  It's freedom!
[01:19:48.272 --> 01:19:48.712]  It's good!

[01:19:59.397 --> 01:20:00.258]  Admit it and fix it.

[01:23:54.533 --> 01:24:05.760]  We just heard from Ventura.
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:13.705]  He thinks that was the best radio interview he'd ever done, Friday, of thousands.
[01:24:13.705 --> 01:24:16.467]  And we were saying that was the best interview.
[01:24:16.467 --> 01:24:19.308]  And everybody's saying it on the web.
[01:24:19.308 --> 01:24:20.569]  Posted up at InfoWars.com.
[01:24:24.356 --> 01:24:25.898]  Jesse's like, I want to come down to Austin.
[01:24:25.898 --> 01:24:27.519]  I'll let you take a week vacation.
[01:24:27.519 --> 01:24:30.082]  I'll do the show.
[01:24:30.082 --> 01:24:30.422]  Okay.
[01:24:30.422 --> 01:24:32.003]  I said, I'm going to go to your phone calls here.
[01:24:32.003 --> 01:24:38.149]  I, um, I'm going to get into a lot of other issues.
[01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:40.050]  I haven't even gotten into the news yet.
[01:24:40.050 --> 01:24:41.532]  Just this whole Mexico situations.
[01:24:43.214 --> 01:24:44.435]  Imploding our own nation.
[01:24:44.435 --> 01:24:46.416]  I mean, it's really happening.
[01:24:46.416 --> 01:24:48.397]  And people think some of this is hyperbole.
[01:24:48.397 --> 01:24:49.998]  This is not hyperbole, folks.
[01:24:49.998 --> 01:24:51.979]  It's worse than I can even explain to you.
[01:24:51.979 --> 01:24:55.521]  And I know a lot of you are smarter than I am, and you understand that.
[01:24:55.521 --> 01:24:59.744]  It's just for some of you out there, the new listeners, this is not a joke, folks, okay?
[01:24:59.744 --> 01:25:02.866]  This radio show is serious.
[01:25:02.866 --> 01:25:04.827]  And most people would crack up under the pressure.
[01:25:04.827 --> 01:25:06.108]  I don't know how I do it.
[01:25:06.108 --> 01:25:07.529]  I'm not a perfect person.
[01:25:12.526 --> 01:25:13.246]  I don't know.
[01:25:13.246 --> 01:25:14.127]  I'm not perfect.
[01:25:14.127 --> 01:25:16.568]  Some people criticize me, but have you walked a mile in my shoes?
[01:25:16.568 --> 01:25:18.008]  I mean, really, have you thought about it?
[01:25:18.008 --> 01:25:20.690]  What it's like?
[01:25:20.690 --> 01:25:22.170]  It's insane, is what it is.
[01:25:22.170 --> 01:25:22.770]  Reality.
[01:25:22.770 --> 01:25:24.711]  Facing reality is insane.
[01:25:24.711 --> 01:25:25.692]  Bill in Vegas.
[01:25:25.692 --> 01:25:26.272]  You're on the air.
[01:25:26.272 --> 01:25:27.412]  Go ahead.
[01:25:27.412 --> 01:25:28.133]  Hello, Alex.
[01:25:28.133 --> 01:25:30.054]  You're the absolute best.
[01:25:30.054 --> 01:25:30.594]  You're the best.
[01:25:30.594 --> 01:25:31.594]  What's on your mind, Bill?
[01:25:31.594 --> 01:25:32.415]  Two things.
[01:25:32.415 --> 01:25:37.657]  First, let me say that our local 9-11 group in Vegas has merged with a brand new chapter of We Are Change.
[01:25:37.657 --> 01:25:40.298]  We have some very focused patriots committed to fighting tyranny.
[01:25:40.794 --> 01:25:45.297]  Anyone in Vegas listening, check out our website at WeAreChangedLasVegas.com.
[01:25:45.297 --> 01:25:52.981]  And now the second thing, I hope you don't get upset with me for saying this, Alex, because I love, I respect, have great admiration for Governor Ventura.
[01:25:52.981 --> 01:26:00.225]  He's done a lot of great work, but I saw him on both the Joy Behar Show and the Geraldo Show, and it was a big disappointment.
[01:26:00.225 --> 01:26:09.831]  On the Behar Show, he was attributing the success of 9-11 attacks to the great incompetence on part of the Bush Administration, and by doing this, he's basically agreeing with the 9-11 lying cover-up.
[01:26:10.345 --> 01:26:20.557]  Then on Geraldo, Mike Huckabee baits him by saying that he believes that the hostilities in the Middle East were because of the terrorists that flew planes into buildings, and Jesse says, well, that may be true.
[01:26:20.557 --> 01:26:22.459]  So I just want to know where he really stands.
[01:26:23.547 --> 01:26:40.773]  Well, look, Ventura is in easy-going mode most of the time, and if somebody challenges him and says, your book's making up stuff about 9-11, then he gets into Building 7 on The View, on, you know, Good Morning America, on all these shows.
[01:26:40.773 --> 01:26:49.356]  He's always said, we don't know what happened, we need a new investigation, but even if you believe it was Al-Qaeda, this is happening because we're over there.
[01:26:49.356 --> 01:26:51.557]  So basically, he is there
[01:26:53.328 --> 01:26:59.833]  Looking at both positions, both views, kind of like Ron Paul saying, either way you cut it, it's bad.
[01:26:59.833 --> 01:27:04.417]  I mean, Ventura went public for 9-11 Truth on this show, what, two and a half years ago?
[01:27:04.417 --> 01:27:05.318]  First time ever.
[01:27:05.318 --> 01:27:08.220]  He said, I want to go public for 9-11 Truth on your show.
[01:27:08.220 --> 01:27:09.301]  He went public.
[01:27:09.301 --> 01:27:11.143]  He went over it.
[01:27:11.143 --> 01:27:12.143]  And, you know, he spent on
[01:27:13.104 --> 01:27:21.912]  I mean, I don't have time to watch them all, but I've probably seen, I don't know, 10 or more big national TV shows where he talks about Building 7.
[01:27:21.912 --> 01:27:23.734]  And they say, well, how dare you say Bush did it?
[01:27:23.734 --> 01:27:25.756]  And he says, well, I don't think Bush even runs anything.
[01:27:25.756 --> 01:27:27.558]  I think Cheney was running it.
[01:27:27.558 --> 01:27:28.699]  You know, he was in control of it.
[01:27:29.139 --> 01:27:32.561]  So, you know, incredibly bold by Ventura.
[01:27:32.561 --> 01:27:38.305]  But if someone's sitting there arguing with him, bringing up... I mean, I haven't seen it, so I haven't heard it.
[01:27:38.305 --> 01:27:43.508]  That's not what... See, and I knew disinformation would try to spin this, and some people did, but I don't care.
[01:27:43.508 --> 01:27:44.628]  The truth's the truth.
[01:27:44.628 --> 01:27:49.231]  I got mad at Debra Medina, the gubernatorial candidate, because she said it's healthy, it's good to question 9-11.
[01:27:50.772 --> 01:28:05.142]  And she said that in all these interviews after the Beck thing and then suddenly said, I agree, they're basically trash, they're scum, they're despicable and said it enthusiastically and then never responded in the next week and a half after that to what her real position was.
[01:28:05.142 --> 01:28:05.603]  It was the
[01:28:06.843 --> 01:28:10.085]  It was the vitriol, the flip-flopping in it.
[01:28:10.085 --> 01:28:11.546]  But I haven't seen the Ventura thing.
[01:28:11.546 --> 01:28:12.807]  But you know what?
[01:28:12.807 --> 01:28:16.529]  Send me those clips and when I get Jesse back on, we'll ask him.
[01:28:16.529 --> 01:28:17.270]  But I know what he's going to say.
[01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:22.133]  He's going to say, Alex, I've always said we don't know what really happened.
[01:28:22.133 --> 01:28:25.615]  And my point is, even if you believe they did it,
[01:28:26.483 --> 01:28:27.624]  Yeah, if he's listening, I love you, Jesse.
[01:28:27.624 --> 01:28:28.845]  I'm not attacking you.
[01:28:28.845 --> 01:28:29.445]  Not at all.
[01:28:29.445 --> 01:28:30.026]  I love you, Bill.
[01:28:51.707 --> 01:29:04.973]  Next time he's on, he wasn't going to be back on until June, because next week he's going to go back to Mexico, fly back, he drives an RV down there, and then he flies back up, his wife's still down there.
[01:29:04.973 --> 01:29:11.776]  So he's going back until June when they come back to start shooting the next episodes of the TV program.
[01:29:11.776 --> 01:29:13.437]  I mean, did you see his TV show?
[01:29:13.437 --> 01:29:15.598]  Going over the evidence of 9-11 being an inside job?
[01:29:16.493 --> 01:29:20.660]  I mean, his book gets into how it's clear evidence of an inside job.
[01:29:20.660 --> 01:29:25.808]  But Ventura will sit there and repeat back somebody's statement to him.
[01:29:25.808 --> 01:29:27.471]  You know, in the form of an answer.
[01:29:27.471 --> 01:29:29.033]  But I haven't seen it.
[01:29:29.033 --> 01:29:30.916]  But I have seen him separately take that position.
[01:29:32.468 --> 01:29:34.129]  Well, I don't know what happened on 9-11.
[01:29:34.129 --> 01:29:35.390]  There's a lot of questions.
[01:29:35.390 --> 01:29:38.412]  But even if you believe they attacked us, boy, what a screw-up by the government.
[01:29:38.412 --> 01:29:39.312]  What a bunch of idiots.
[01:29:39.312 --> 01:29:41.753]  And they attacked us because we're over there.
[01:29:41.753 --> 01:29:44.515]  So that's simply debating the issue.
[01:29:44.515 --> 01:29:48.957]  This isn't like a religion where you just have to totally agree to some absolute specific.
[01:29:48.957 --> 01:29:51.799]  You just gotta agree to ask questions.
[01:29:51.799 --> 01:29:53.200]  We're on the march.
[01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:55.721]  The Empire's on the run.

[01:32:01.348 --> 01:32:06.989]  George Washington said, Government is not reason, it is not eloquence, it is force, like fire.
[01:32:06.989 --> 01:32:09.570]  It is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.
[01:32:09.570 --> 01:32:15.411]  America's government is no longer the servant of the people and the protector of our liberty, but has become that fearful master.
[01:32:15.411 --> 01:32:21.332]  We the people must understand the nature of this government gone awry if we are to be successful in saving our country.
[01:32:21.332 --> 01:32:28.134]  America is being deliberately destroyed by a cabal of international gangsters so that she can be forced into subjugation to a one world government.
[01:32:28.394 --> 01:32:32.618]  The God-given, unalienable rights of the Declaration of Independence are in jeopardy.
[01:32:32.618 --> 01:32:35.860]  We must not let them be stolen by ambitious and evil men.

[01:33:09.884 --> 01:33:13.246]  Alex, we don't know what happened on 9-11.
[01:33:13.246 --> 01:33:17.129]  All we know is the government's lied to us over and over again.
[01:33:17.129 --> 01:33:19.511]  The Gulf of Tonkin never happened.
[01:33:19.511 --> 01:33:23.393]  We lost 58,000 American lives, Alex.
[01:33:23.393 --> 01:33:25.955]  Navy SEALs don't get angry, Alex.
[01:33:25.955 --> 01:33:28.677]  They get even.
[01:33:28.677 --> 01:33:30.558]  There, there's a better Jesse Ventura imitation.
[01:33:30.558 --> 01:33:35.061]  I didn't really put myself in the Jesse Ventura mode earlier.
[01:33:35.061 --> 01:33:38.924]  But the point I was making about Debra Medina, I didn't finish it, was that
[01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:42.961]  And I made this clear when I criticized her.
[01:33:42.961 --> 01:33:47.024]  And I gave her incredible support and still said vote for her, but I'm allowed to be upset by something.
[01:33:47.024 --> 01:33:48.065]  And most people agreed with me.
[01:33:48.065 --> 01:33:54.189]  The vast majority were hurt by it when she agreed that we were basically dangerous scum, trash, despicable.
[01:33:54.189 --> 01:33:55.770]  Absolutely they are.
[01:33:55.770 --> 01:33:57.972]  It's ridiculous.
[01:33:57.972 --> 01:34:09.500]  It was that, not that she's not a 9-11 truther, it was that she said it was despicable to ask the questions after she said it was healthy.
[01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:10.861]  That was the whole point.
[01:34:12.236 --> 01:34:15.542]  That was the issue I had.
[01:34:15.542 --> 01:34:16.464]  And then I was worried.
[01:34:16.464 --> 01:34:21.594]  I said, my God, if she'll flip-flop like that, what else will she do?
[01:34:21.594 --> 01:34:24.900]  Ventura has always been all over the field with 9-11, saying he doesn't know what happened.
[01:34:26.687 --> 01:34:29.528]  But that it looks like it's an inside job and he thinks Channing was behind it.
[01:34:29.528 --> 01:34:43.833]  I mean, if you ask him, who do you think's behind 9-11, and he said it all over national television, and I don't think it's fair to criticize him if you're saying he was taking their talking point and putting it back on them, when he's all over television saying the evidence shows inside job.
[01:34:43.833 --> 01:34:48.855]  But I don't want to get off into that.
[01:34:48.855 --> 01:34:53.136]  I've got a report here.
[01:34:53.136 --> 01:34:55.557]  This is from Free Patriot Press.
[01:34:56.653 --> 01:35:03.376]  And I've got Watson and Kurt Nemo doing a blurb on this right now.
[01:35:03.376 --> 01:35:10.999]  And this particular lady went in, trying to look her up on exactly who she's with so we can get her on.
[01:35:10.999 --> 01:35:22.784]  And she went in to the Southern Poverty Law Center and talked to their Director of Research, Heidi Beirich, B-E-I-R-I-C-H, this is coming up in the next hour, I'm going to play some clips of this.
[01:35:25.259 --> 01:35:29.522]  In this interview, they're saying, do you know how incredibly dangerous conspiracy theories are?
[01:35:29.522 --> 01:35:31.403]  Just even having them causes death.
[01:35:31.403 --> 01:35:32.644]  It's evil.
[01:35:32.644 --> 01:35:51.578]  And if you don't want We Are Change on this list, because they listed We Are Change, which is a peace group, anti-war group, whose credo is be the change you want to see in the world, Mahatma Gandhi, they put them in there basically as a dangerous, evil, radical group.
[01:35:52.398 --> 01:35:54.258]  Because they're concerned about We Are Change.
[01:35:54.258 --> 01:35:59.560]  And they demonize anybody that stands up for freedom.
[01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:00.280]  You gotta love it.
[01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:04.081]  They were called left-wing extremists when they criticized Bush.
[01:36:04.081 --> 01:36:05.501]  Now they're criticizing Obama.
[01:36:05.501 --> 01:36:06.941]  They're called right-wingers.
[01:36:06.941 --> 01:36:08.942]  It's just citizens that are tired of it.
[01:36:08.942 --> 01:36:11.843]  Okay?
[01:36:11.843 --> 01:36:17.544]  And the lady says, if you want off that list, you need to stop the conspiracy theories.
[01:36:17.544 --> 01:36:21.805]  So, you question the government, you get put on a McCarthyite-type list.
[01:36:24.614 --> 01:36:25.874]  That's not even fair to McCarthy.
[01:36:25.874 --> 01:36:29.335]  It's come out in the Russian documents that he was actually right.
[01:36:29.335 --> 01:36:32.676]  It was when he found out that our own military was funding the communists.
[01:36:32.676 --> 01:36:33.836]  Of course they fund!
[01:36:33.836 --> 01:36:37.817]  Saddam, Al Qaeda, the communists, they put Mao in.
[01:36:37.817 --> 01:36:47.120]  I'll never forget, a couple years ago I saw the CIA section chief, it was OSS and then CIA, in China during and after World War II.
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:50.861]  And he says, oh yes, we made the decision in 1949 to actually put Mao Zedong in.
[01:36:51.801 --> 01:36:55.903]  Now, I know Anthony Sutton got government documents and wrote about that 25 years ago.
[01:36:55.903 --> 01:36:57.364]  I know a lot of that have been declassified.
[01:36:57.364 --> 01:37:12.390]  But to see them go on television and say that the CIA put Mao in, who is the biggest mass murderer in history, and now CNN, the Communist News Network, is telling us Mao is good.
[01:37:12.390 --> 01:37:15.172]  Remember, I played that several times in the last two weeks.
[01:37:15.172 --> 01:37:15.872]  Mao is wonderful!
[01:37:17.489 --> 01:37:19.410]  Mal's like our new Founding Father!
[01:37:19.410 --> 01:37:26.032]  George Washington's bad, and they have all these shows demonizing the Founding Fathers, but Mal Saiteng, man, he is a wonderful guy!
[01:37:26.032 --> 01:37:34.935]  Alright, we're going to our guest here, and then back to- I've got a guest on for about 10 minutes, and then we're gonna go to John Anti-Nazi Noel Skip.
[01:37:34.935 --> 01:37:36.276]  Hey, don't say you're anti-Nazi!
[01:37:37.602 --> 01:37:40.283]  You might get put on the Southern Poverty Law Center list as a Nazi.
[01:37:40.283 --> 01:37:42.104]  Schwarzenegger's good.
[01:37:42.104 --> 01:37:45.245]  He says he loves Hitler and wants to be a dictator.
[01:37:45.245 --> 01:37:47.466]  And so the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center love him.
[01:37:47.466 --> 01:37:52.368]  But if you're an anti-Nazi like me, you're gonna be put on the list anti-Nazi, so you gotta watch out there.
[01:37:52.368 --> 01:37:55.989]  They'll have all their government Nazi operatives like Hal Turner come after you.
[01:37:55.989 --> 01:37:57.870]  Now admit it, FBI.
[01:37:57.870 --> 01:38:04.192]  All you foolish white supremacists out there, 98% of you are led around by a bunch of government operatives.
[01:38:04.192 --> 01:38:05.433]  But hey, you like being idiots?
[01:38:05.433 --> 01:38:06.433]  Go ahead, enjoy yourselves.
[01:38:09.761 --> 01:38:14.125]  But, uh, oh yes, we've proven government operatives posing as Nazis make me the number one target.
[01:38:14.125 --> 01:38:15.806]  What does that tell you out there?
[01:38:15.806 --> 01:38:25.254]  Two hours after Bloplosky kills cops and gives himself up, they put on the news he did it because of me, and it turns out Bloplosky in Pittsburgh hated me!
[01:38:25.254 --> 01:38:30.958]  And now the Southern Privacy Law Center is sitting there saying I caused it!
[01:38:30.958 --> 01:38:31.439]  I did it!
[01:38:31.439 --> 01:38:38.004]  I mean, I could definitely sue these people, but I just spend all the time and money on this instead of making films and fighting.
[01:38:38.004 --> 01:38:39.325]  No, I'll just expose these people.
[01:38:41.787 --> 01:38:43.708]  Oh my head, I got a headache.
[01:38:43.708 --> 01:38:48.669]  It's just... I'm just so sick of it all.
[01:38:48.669 --> 01:38:52.250]  Why can't people just wake up and see what's going on for themselves?
[01:38:52.250 --> 01:38:59.332]  And that fighting over religious and racial lines is not the way to go.
[01:38:59.332 --> 01:39:04.773]  Yes, when the globalists have an agenda to break down our borders, you have to cover it because it's driving down the wages and bankrupting us.
[01:39:04.773 --> 01:39:06.334]  But that's not a racial issue.
[01:39:06.334 --> 01:39:07.494]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up.
[01:39:10.731 --> 01:39:19.214]  We have Karen Quinn Tostado on with us, and she's got the Tax Holiday website.
[01:39:19.214 --> 01:39:20.395]  She's going to give you that URL.
[01:39:20.395 --> 01:39:23.135]  You've probably heard her call into the show and a lot of other programs.
[01:39:23.135 --> 01:39:26.597]  And she's really been beating the drum the last few months, and it's gained a lot of steam.
[01:39:26.597 --> 01:39:30.638]  And today is the 15th of March.
[01:39:30.638 --> 01:39:34.600]  And so to tell us about this is Karen.
[01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:35.340]  Karen, good to have you here.
[01:39:36.354 --> 01:39:40.320]  Alex, thank you very, very much for everything that you do.
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:43.204]  I agree with what you said, and if it weren't for you, Alex...
[01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:48.903]  My husband and I would not know nearly what we know, and we owe you a great deal of gratitude.
[01:39:48.903 --> 01:39:49.644]  No, you don't.
[01:39:49.644 --> 01:39:51.105]  No, you don't, Karen.
[01:39:51.105 --> 01:40:00.031]  Listen, my family has no future if I don't fight these people, and that's why I'm ready to be demonized, I'm ready to be killed, if that's what the globalists do, because I know there's no choice.
[01:40:00.031 --> 01:40:05.234]  So I don't deserve any credit except for some hard work, but I mean, how could you not work hard when you're up against this?
[01:40:05.234 --> 01:40:07.276]  But you are having a big effect.
[01:40:07.276 --> 01:40:09.217]  Tell us about what's going on.
[01:40:09.217 --> 01:40:12.599]  I mean, Iceland's done this, Greece is doing it.
[01:40:12.599 --> 01:40:13.520]  This is the way to go.
[01:40:14.420 --> 01:40:15.301]  Well, thank you.
[01:40:15.301 --> 01:40:16.522]  That's what we hope.
[01:40:16.522 --> 01:40:19.804]  So what I'd like to do first, though, is clarify a few things.
[01:40:19.804 --> 01:40:28.510]  Folks, I'm not a tax evader, an anarchist, an America-hater, and I have absolutely no political aspirations whatsoever.
[01:40:28.510 --> 01:40:41.740]  But what I am is a disappointed, angered, proud, and motivated American who, like yourself and millions of others, recognizes that social, economic, and political tyranny has been set up globally.
[01:40:42.665 --> 01:40:50.010]  Folks, the time for freedom to be handed down to us without our individual participation and sacrifice has passed.
[01:40:50.010 --> 01:40:57.115]  That time has passed, and it is now time for all of us who value our freedom to set aside our differences and unite.
[01:40:58.769 --> 01:41:25.414]  And so our intention at TaxFree15.com is to peacefully, collectively, and non-violently, and folks, that's key, non-violently withhold as much labor and money from the system as possible for four consecutive days in order to send a loud and very clear message to our government and the offshore bankers who control it that we are not responsible for their debt.
[01:41:27.443 --> 01:41:39.887]  And we feel that as long as we go about our life as usual, our actions imply that we're willing to go along with whatever they decide that they're going to decree or pass an executive order about.
[01:41:39.887 --> 01:41:46.830]  This is about peaceful non-compliance and disrupting the system to get their attention because they're not listening to us.
[01:41:47.611 --> 01:41:52.920]  And as long as we keep pretending that things will get better by giving away our power, we lose it.
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:54.303]  We've got to pull it back.
[01:41:54.303 --> 01:41:59.672]  So we've got a four-step plan that everyone can participate in one form or another.
[01:42:00.891 --> 01:42:03.252]  Now number one is no work, no school.
[01:42:03.252 --> 01:42:05.652]  Our future depends on restoring our rights.
[01:42:05.652 --> 01:42:07.032]  So plan ahead.
[01:42:07.032 --> 01:42:08.033]  Ask for time off.
[01:42:08.033 --> 01:42:09.573]  Use vacation days.
[01:42:09.573 --> 01:42:11.754]  Get school assignments for your children.
[01:42:11.754 --> 01:42:15.995]  And also there will be some online educational programs during those days.
[01:42:15.995 --> 01:42:23.156]  See, April 15th through the 19th, actually through the 18th, is only Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
[01:42:23.156 --> 01:42:25.377]  So it's not missing a week of school.
[01:42:25.377 --> 01:42:26.137]  It's two days.
[01:42:27.349 --> 01:42:35.271]  And we're going to have education during those days, too, that's offered online that promotes the Constitution, because the 19th, folks, is Patriots Day.
[01:42:35.973 --> 01:42:41.474]  So this is taking four days off to really find out about all these things that are going on that we don't know about.
[01:42:41.474 --> 01:42:47.276]  And number two... And by the way, just getting ready for next month, I'm going to take off Thursday and Friday.
[01:42:47.276 --> 01:42:54.838]  We've got some amazing rebroadcasts for folks just to spend time with my family and continue to teach my children the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:42:54.838 --> 01:42:57.979]  So I'm actually going to start this this month.
[01:42:59.215 --> 01:43:07.017]  That's wonderful news, Alex, and that's what people can do because as you bring to light so many times there are provocateurs out there.
[01:43:07.017 --> 01:43:15.379]  It's not always the easiest thing to get out and to be a part of a movement that takes to the streets because they're well-armed, they're well-equipped.
[01:43:15.379 --> 01:43:18.480]  But you can at least deprogram your children and turn the television off.
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:19.982]  Exactly.
[01:43:19.982 --> 01:43:20.523]  Exactly.
[01:43:20.523 --> 01:43:28.475]  So now the step two is don't buy anything from large corporations or fast food places or online stores that are corporate stores.
[01:43:28.475 --> 01:43:30.539]  If you have to shop, go to a mom and pop.
[01:43:31.089 --> 01:43:35.573]  If everyone keeps their money for four days, offshore bankers will notice.
[01:43:35.573 --> 01:43:40.837]  And that way, if you cannot stay home from work, you can at least not shop for those days.
[01:43:40.837 --> 01:43:43.299]  The third part is don't comply.
[01:43:43.299 --> 01:43:50.285]  Take your savings out of large corporate banks or leave only what you need to cover monthly bills.
[01:43:50.285 --> 01:43:54.108]  Work at getting off the grid, forming co-ops within communities.
[01:43:54.108 --> 01:43:55.830]  We need each other, folks.
[01:43:55.830 --> 01:43:56.690]  We need each other.
[01:43:56.690 --> 01:43:58.412]  We have to come together as one
[01:43:59.321 --> 01:44:04.005]  That means our networking energy is the only way we're going to save ourselves.
[01:44:04.005 --> 01:44:05.987]  Now step four is ask why.
[01:44:05.987 --> 01:44:08.209]  Ask yourself first.
[01:44:08.209 --> 01:44:12.733]  Why am I allowing this travesty of government to continue?
[01:44:12.733 --> 01:44:16.476]  Why are we not restoring our Constitution?
[01:44:16.476 --> 01:44:20.420]  Why are my children being taxed for banker bonuses?
[01:44:20.979 --> 01:44:25.124]  And then what's very important is pick up that phone.
[01:44:25.124 --> 01:44:30.029]  Pick up that phone and call your misrepresentatives and ask them those same questions.
[01:44:30.029 --> 01:44:39.100]  Tell them that you are participating in the strike and that we are Americans, we are free and sovereign, and we want some accountability.
[01:44:40.197 --> 01:44:42.578]  And then educate your folks.
[01:44:42.578 --> 01:44:44.218]  Educate your children.
[01:44:44.218 --> 01:44:46.599]  Take this time to watch Fall of the Republic.
[01:44:46.599 --> 01:44:49.720]  Alex Jones has some great information out there.
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:52.862]  Jason Burma says we need a break, folks.
[01:44:52.862 --> 01:45:00.404]  As long as we keep being in the system and we keep working hard, they think we're okay and we're not okay with it.
[01:45:00.404 --> 01:45:05.406]  They ignore us when we call them up and they ignore us when two million others show up at the Capitol.
[01:45:08.055 --> 01:45:14.437]  And when you talk about spending time with your children, ladies and gentlemen, television has killed our culture.
[01:45:14.437 --> 01:45:19.999]  Because people don't talk to their neighbors, they don't interact, they don't talk about what's really happening in their town, at work.
[01:45:19.999 --> 01:45:28.021]  They just go in, turn the television on, put a TV dinner in, and are not tuned into reality, they're tuned into the idiot box.
[01:45:28.021 --> 01:45:30.022]  And so the biggest thing of rebellion is to start
[01:45:30.922 --> 01:45:44.227]  Watching less television and to start spending more time with your friends and family, or use the matrix of television to reach into the matrix through films, through materials, to get people out of the matrix.
[01:45:44.227 --> 01:45:55.331]  Because so many people are so deep in the matrix, you've got to use the same medium of the matrix to, you know, literally go in there and kind of throw cold water on them to wake them up.
[01:45:56.513 --> 01:46:02.636]  to what's happening and here's an exciting article police join marchers in Athens.
[01:46:02.636 --> 01:46:04.577]  It's in the Associated Press.
[01:46:04.577 --> 01:46:06.998]  It's also in the Star newspaper.
[01:46:06.998 --> 01:46:18.623]  Athens street clashes erupt between rioting use of police in central Athens Thursday and since thousands demonstrated during a nationwide strike the cash-strapped government austerity measures.
[01:46:18.623 --> 01:46:22.784]  And it goes on to report that the police have joined in
[01:46:24.685 --> 01:46:29.968]  And that Coast Guard, Fire Brigade, government bureaucrats, they're not going to work.
[01:46:29.968 --> 01:46:32.529]  They're saying it's a foreign banking takeover.
[01:46:32.529 --> 01:46:45.476]  And if you look at Greece, you look at Chile, you look at New Zealand, I mean, all these countries, the U.S., all the financial ministers, I mean, almost all are Goldman Sachs operatives.
[01:46:45.476 --> 01:46:47.838]  I mean, this is the main group.
[01:46:47.838 --> 01:46:52.140]  And they go in, they take over government, and they implode the economy, and then
[01:46:53.410 --> 01:46:55.811]  They come in and take over the nation.
[01:46:55.811 --> 01:46:57.831]  And so we've got to identify these people.
[01:46:57.831 --> 01:47:19.076]  And what I like about what you're doing is, doing this month after month after month, Karen, it will build and build and build, and people should contact local newspapers, they should write articles about it for their blogs, and it will just build and build and build, and Americans will start getting the idea of non-compliance, like Gandhi and many others did.
[01:47:19.076 --> 01:47:21.097]  This is a really important thing that's happening.
[01:47:21.721 --> 01:47:23.042]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:47:23.042 --> 01:47:32.547]  That's what we're really shooting for because when we talk about our freedom, we've lost the ability to think for ourselves because we've been programmed not to.
[01:47:32.547 --> 01:47:40.452]  But when we step back and we stop watching their programs and listening to their propaganda and we start to explore and go into your
[01:47:40.452 --> 01:47:41.293]  We're good to go.
[01:48:05.852 --> 01:48:12.813]  And Brigida Johnstotter, who was on your program last week, look at the wonderful things she's been able to do in Iceland.
[01:48:12.813 --> 01:48:14.534]  It's really we, the people.
[01:48:14.534 --> 01:48:17.734]  And this could even be an international strike, Alex.
[01:48:17.734 --> 01:48:22.555]  Wouldn't that send a message to say, you can't control us for four days.
[01:48:22.555 --> 01:48:27.976]  We're going to do what we want, we're going to think what we want, and we're going to start to learn about what's really important.
[01:48:27.976 --> 01:48:34.758]  Because we've forgotten that all we need is clean air, clean water, healthy food, self-sufficient communities, and
[01:48:36.132 --> 01:48:37.433]  We need integrity.
[01:48:37.433 --> 01:48:50.761]  All of those things governments take, but we can give them to ourselves and we can turn this around and look at it as an opportunity for a new beginning and an ending of tyranny that's been around for generations.
[01:48:50.761 --> 01:48:59.506]  And Karen, imagine, because the big kickoff is next month, it's starting up today, it's kind of a beta test.
[01:48:59.506 --> 01:49:03.789]  Imagine, think how far We Are Change has gone.
[01:49:04.872 --> 01:49:08.654]  Think how far this can go if you get involved.
[01:49:08.654 --> 01:49:31.148]  Think of what it can grow into and then the other groups that it will spur to be created and then to grow and then to influence and create other organizations where there's just thousands of grassroots organizations with true diversity pushing for liberty, for true education, enlightenment of what's happening on our planet and imagine
[01:49:32.432 --> 01:49:37.998]  April 19th, Patriots Day, next month.
[01:49:37.998 --> 01:49:46.387]  Imagine worldwide people celebrating Patriots Day and rediscovering the spirit of American liberty.
[01:49:46.387 --> 01:49:50.872]  And that way America becomes a light of freedom again, instead of a light of darkness.
[01:49:51.391 --> 01:49:53.133]  Exactly, Alex.
[01:49:53.133 --> 01:49:55.036]  I can dream that big.
[01:49:55.036 --> 01:50:04.208]  And every one of us can dream that big if we allow ourselves to recognize we've all been scammed, we've all been lied to and stolen from.
[01:50:04.208 --> 01:50:06.271]  And not only us, our children, our parents.
[01:50:06.311 --> 01:50:06.852]  We're good to go.
[01:50:23.534 --> 01:50:36.725]  Is this dominant criminal minority, Rothschilds, Rockefellers, the bankers, Alex, you know this much better than I do, but we have to start empowering ourselves instead of giving it away saying, please save me.
[01:50:38.210 --> 01:50:40.871]  Because this enemy's not going to give us any quarter.
[01:50:40.871 --> 01:50:42.252]  They're not going to back off.
[01:50:42.252 --> 01:50:46.816]  As Thomas Jefferson said, the level of tyranny you will live under is the exact amount you put up with.
[01:50:46.816 --> 01:50:48.237]  It's a bottomless pit.
[01:50:48.237 --> 01:50:49.838]  More and more evil people get into power.
[01:50:49.838 --> 01:50:52.460]  It only gets worse and worse until you say no.
[01:50:52.460 --> 01:50:57.543]  We're going to come back, give out the website, then we're going to go to your calls and a ton of news.
[01:50:57.543 --> 01:50:58.064]  Stay with us.
[01:51:03.132 --> 01:51:04.773]  Is it safe to breathe anymore?
[01:51:04.773 --> 01:51:16.223]  Crowded public places, global pandemics, and news reports of potential new strains of bacteria and viruses make you wonder, what if there was a germ-killing nasal spray that acted almost like hand sanitizer for your nose?
[01:51:16.223 --> 01:51:17.184]  There is!
[01:51:17.184 --> 01:51:20.927]  It's called Sinophresh Homeopathic Nasal Spray, and it's a proven germ killer.
[01:51:21.267 --> 01:51:29.836]  Cyanofresh is a revolutionary doctor-recommended nasal spray that kills a broad spectrum of viruses, bacteria, molds, and fungi on contact in your nose.
[01:51:29.836 --> 01:51:38.003]  Cyanofresh causes no drug interactions, no loss of smell, no rebound congestion, contains no alcohol, is non-habit forming, and is safe for daily use.
[01:51:38.003 --> 01:51:40.486]  Cyanofresh must be a part of your family's survival plan.

[01:51:58.166 --> 01:51:59.307]  Use SinoFresh.
[01:51:59.307 --> 01:51:59.848]  It works.
[01:52:01.485 --> 01:52:02.786]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:02.786 --> 01:52:08.368]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:08.368 --> 01:52:13.390]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:13.390 --> 01:52:18.972]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:52:18.972 --> 01:52:23.654]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:24.195 --> 01:52:24.995]  We're good to go.
[01:52:42.304 --> 01:52:45.465]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:45.465 --> 01:52:45.785]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:45.785 --> 01:52:49.107]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:49.107 --> 01:52:50.827]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:01.417 --> 01:53:07.420]  You can't live without food, can't live without water, you can't live without being prepared, and you can't live without StandBirds!

[01:53:29.671 --> 01:53:30.171]  We're good to go.
[01:54:18.563 --> 01:54:21.765]  Karen Quinn Tostado is our guest.
[01:54:21.765 --> 01:54:24.327]  Karen, fire out the website for people that want to learn more.
[01:54:24.327 --> 01:54:26.909]  It's packed with wonderful information.
[01:54:29.278 --> 01:54:31.139]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:54:31.139 --> 01:54:33.801]  It's TaxFree15.com.
[01:54:33.801 --> 01:54:36.323]  That's TaxFree15.com.
[01:54:36.323 --> 01:54:42.908]  You can also access it by going to TaxFree15, with a T-H on the end of it, dot com.
[01:54:42.908 --> 01:54:50.935]  And I want to encourage folks to register, because that way we can start getting the updates out there, and we can get state coordinators.
[01:54:50.935 --> 01:54:57.199]  And I also want to encourage them to reach out, because I would love to stand with the Greek people.
[01:54:58.080 --> 01:54:58.380]  Tax-free15.com
[01:55:27.463 --> 01:55:29.545]  TaxFree15.com.
[01:55:29.545 --> 01:55:35.973]  Come on folks, let's all get together and put a halt to government gone wild and party in on our dime.
[01:55:35.973 --> 01:55:42.180]  Time to take it back, rebuild from the inside out and change the game because we are the pawns in the game.
[01:55:43.141 --> 01:55:44.222]  Absolutely.
[01:55:44.222 --> 01:56:06.636]  Well, Karen, I'm going to get you back up next month, right before the kickoff of the big official date on Tax Day, the same day that we're premiering at PrisonPlanet.TV and on DVD, Jason Bermas's new film, 18 Months in the Making, Invisible Empire, New World Order Defined, and every film we make, every radio interview we do, it's another strike at the New World Order, and this is very exciting.
[01:56:06.636 --> 01:56:07.977]  Karen, we'll talk to you again very soon.
[01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:10.921]  Thank you very, very much, Alex.
[01:56:10.921 --> 01:56:11.701]  Don't thank me!
[01:56:11.701 --> 01:56:17.244]  Look, I want to just say that we're all in this together and we'll either hang together or hang separate.
[01:56:17.244 --> 01:56:20.826]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:56:20.826 --> 01:56:30.551]  Speaking of films, ladies and gentlemen, you can pre-order now Invisible Empire.
[01:56:30.551 --> 01:56:35.833]  If you want to be the first person to get this film in your mailbox.
[01:56:35.833 --> 01:56:37.334]  It comes out a month from now.
[01:56:38.729 --> 01:56:42.092]  And we plan to start trying to ship it a few days before the actual release dates.
[01:56:42.092 --> 01:56:43.653]  People will be getting it in or around that date.
[01:56:43.653 --> 01:56:49.998]  We're getting better about that and getting it into manufacturing early so we can ship out a few days before.
[01:56:49.998 --> 01:57:03.048]  But if you want it on the high-quality DVD with a bunch of key extras, this film... I was here finishing the cover last week with Burmese and was trying to put all the information on the back cover.
[01:57:03.048 --> 01:57:03.809]  You just can't do it.
[01:57:03.809 --> 01:57:05.090]  I mean, government drug dealing,
[01:57:07.210 --> 01:57:17.479]  And how the New World Order set up its systems, hundreds of New World, I mean literally, there's got to be more than a hundred New World Order quotes, Burma says 200, of world leaders saying what the New World Order is.
[01:57:17.479 --> 01:57:21.082]  The New World Order is the state, is God, that's a quote.
[01:57:21.082 --> 01:57:27.347]  It's just an extremely powerful research tool, an awakening tool for anybody in denial about the New World Order.
[01:57:27.347 --> 01:57:28.989]  Pre-order it at InfoWars.com.
[01:57:31.766 --> 01:57:37.348]  We're gonna have a bunch of trailers, there's already been one trailer, but a bunch of new trailers and sneak peeks coming out later this week and next week.
[01:57:37.348 --> 01:57:49.492]  And then the week after, April 21st, April 21st, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, a year in the making.
[01:57:49.492 --> 01:57:55.133]  And this was gonna be a film made by Dew and Jason Douglas, they're great editors, great filmmakers.
[01:57:55.133 --> 01:57:59.995]  But then I got involved, so it's co-directed by the three of us, and
[01:58:03.732 --> 01:58:06.514]  The Underwear Bomber exposed.
[01:58:06.514 --> 01:58:08.736]  The FEMA cams exposed.
[01:58:08.736 --> 01:58:09.276]  The G20.
[01:58:09.276 --> 01:58:12.599]  It just goes on and on.
[01:58:12.599 --> 01:58:16.742]  The Executive Orders, the Continental Government System, the Shadow Government.
[01:58:16.742 --> 01:58:20.385]  That goes up for pre-sale today.
[01:58:20.385 --> 01:58:22.406]  It's not up yet, but it'll be up by tonight.
[01:58:22.406 --> 01:58:25.909]  That's going up today, and there'll be trailers for that next week.
[01:58:27.768 --> 01:58:38.616]  So you can pre-order Invisible Empire right now, and you'll be able by tonight to pre-order Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, at InfoWars.com.
[01:58:38.616 --> 01:58:41.838]  We'll be right back with your phone calls.
[01:58:41.838 --> 01:58:46.561]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[01:58:50.675 --> 01:58:55.221]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:55.221 --> 01:58:59.567]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:59.567 --> 01:59:04.954]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:05.294 --> 01:59:06.035]  It's true.
[01:59:06.035 --> 01:59:11.738]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:11.738 --> 01:59:15.321]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:15.321 --> 01:59:20.044]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:20.044 --> 01:59:22.805]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:22.805 --> 01:59:26.127]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:27.268 --> 01:59:31.409]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:31.409 --> 01:59:36.450]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:36.450 --> 01:59:40.631]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:40.631 --> 01:59:42.411]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:42.411 --> 01:59:47.012]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:59:54.637 --> 01:59:57.039]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:57.039 --> 02:00:06.387]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:06.387 --> 02:00:07.688]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.688 --> 02:00:09.469]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:09.469 --> 02:00:11.210]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:11.210 --> 02:00:12.812]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.812 --> 02:00:13.732]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.732 --> 02:00:18.536]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.536 --> 02:00:22.620]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.809 --> 02:00:27.992]  We have now reached the halfway point in global radio transmission.
[02:00:27.992 --> 02:00:34.056]  We'll begin simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv in T-minus 7 minutes 30 seconds.
[02:00:34.056 --> 02:00:37.438]  Let's go to anti-Nazi in Georgia.
[02:00:37.438 --> 02:00:39.959]  You're on the air.
[02:00:39.959 --> 02:00:42.701]  Alex, this is Joel Antonezzi.
[02:00:42.701 --> 02:00:44.102]  It's spelt anti-Nazi.
[02:00:44.102 --> 02:00:45.143]  That's my last name.
[02:00:45.143 --> 02:00:47.624]  It really is.
[02:00:47.624 --> 02:00:51.147]  I'm an info warrior on fire, let me tell you.
[02:00:51.147 --> 02:00:52.668]  Awesome.
[02:00:53.373 --> 02:00:57.174]  I have a website called wakeupamericanow.info.
[02:00:57.174 --> 02:01:01.796]  Pass out flyers to people out on the street to talk to people in person.
[02:01:01.796 --> 02:01:07.498]  My flyer says wakeupamericanow.info, you've been fooled again.
[02:01:07.498 --> 02:01:11.519]  The swine flu is a hoax and the vaccine is poison.
[02:01:11.519 --> 02:01:13.700]  Educate before you vaccinate.
[02:01:13.700 --> 02:01:16.821]  The drug industry recognized the pharmaceutical industry.
[02:01:16.821 --> 02:01:22.963]  Webster's Dictionary defines pharmaceutical as from the Greek word pharmakia, to practice witchcraft.
[02:01:23.627 --> 02:01:26.710]  All drugs are nothing more than control poison.
[02:01:26.710 --> 02:01:29.493]  Get real news, not big media propaganda.
[02:01:29.493 --> 02:01:32.536]  Now with over 750 interesting links.
[02:01:32.536 --> 02:01:36.540]  Also watch the movie, Fall of the Republic, free on my site.
[02:01:36.540 --> 02:01:38.362]  And catch the Alex Jones Show.
[02:01:38.362 --> 02:01:39.063]  You can dial it 512-646-5000.
[02:01:42.661 --> 02:01:46.763]  That again is... Sir, sir, sir, hold on just a minute, listen.
[02:01:46.763 --> 02:01:51.626]  I don't mind you calling in and plugging stuff, but when it's just, when that's all we do, it's really hurting the show.
[02:01:51.626 --> 02:01:56.609]  Affiliates don't like it because it's just caller after caller, just plugging, plugging, plugging, plugging.
[02:01:56.609 --> 02:02:01.952]  You did two plugs for the site, that's great, but what's some info here on the show?
[02:02:01.952 --> 02:02:03.232]  Pardon me?
[02:02:03.232 --> 02:02:04.313]  What is some info?
[02:02:04.313 --> 02:02:07.194]  I mean, is there anything to discuss here?
[02:02:07.194 --> 02:02:08.735]  I mostly...
[02:02:10.458 --> 02:02:11.918]  Sir, I appreciate your call, but I mean, listen.
[02:02:34.685 --> 02:02:40.407]  I am the most lenient talk show host out there, and I'm going to have to go ahead and probably put my foot down, because I want to get all the activist groups on.
[02:02:40.407 --> 02:02:41.487]  That's what I do.
[02:02:41.487 --> 02:02:54.391]  I promote basically everybody, and I want to support everybody, but I can't just take call after call that just, let me plug something three times, let me plug it a fourth, let me, give me money!
[02:02:54.391 --> 02:02:59.633]  And I had to put my, and I understand you need support, I understand you're in trouble.
[02:03:00.410 --> 02:03:03.011]  But the whole show just can't be every caller.
[02:03:03.011 --> 02:03:04.292]  We don't screen your calls.
[02:03:04.292 --> 02:03:06.493]  It destroys talk radio.
[02:03:06.493 --> 02:03:07.874]  I mean, people want to hear debates.
[02:03:07.874 --> 02:03:09.155]  They want to hear issues.
[02:03:09.155 --> 02:03:13.317]  It's fine if somebody throws a side out, but people just call in to just plug their sites.
[02:03:13.317 --> 02:03:14.358]  And so it can't happen anymore.
[02:03:14.358 --> 02:03:17.739]  In fact, maybe we'll have plug day or something a couple days a month.
[02:03:17.739 --> 02:03:21.782]  We'll just, we'll watch the listeners all tune out, though, and just do nothing but plug.
[02:03:21.782 --> 02:03:23.743]  But then that would hurt you pluggers, wouldn't it?
[02:03:23.743 --> 02:03:27.705]  This is the number one alternative radio show in the world.
[02:03:28.445 --> 02:03:31.812]  And we do want to support everybody, and we do try to empower groups.
[02:03:31.812 --> 02:03:33.476]  That's what I just did.
[02:03:33.476 --> 02:03:35.941]  But it is just killing us.
[02:03:35.941 --> 02:03:37.705]  Noel in Illinois, go ahead.
[02:03:38.886 --> 02:03:41.707]  Alex Jones, how are you this afternoon?
[02:03:41.707 --> 02:03:43.767]  Quick comment before I get to my question.
[02:03:43.767 --> 02:03:58.311]  I was watching late last night C-SPAN 2, and the scum Prime Minister Gordon Brown constantly talked about global regime, global power, how they need to get the America into this global regime.
[02:03:58.311 --> 02:04:01.152]  Gordon Brown looks like a disgusting old man.
[02:04:01.152 --> 02:04:02.972]  But my question is... Well, he's the head of the G20.
[02:04:02.972 --> 02:04:03.652]  He is the real poobah.
[02:04:03.652 --> 02:04:03.852]  Go ahead.
[02:04:06.742 --> 02:04:09.883]  Yeah, he kept talking about G20 as well last night.
[02:04:09.883 --> 02:04:11.904]  It was someone with Reuters.
[02:04:11.904 --> 02:04:19.107]  But my question to you is, listening to you last night talking about fluoride, in terms of toothpaste, what should people use?
[02:04:19.107 --> 02:04:21.868]  I know I use Arm and Hammer, but I don't know if that's good or not.
[02:04:22.572 --> 02:04:25.553]  Um, is there any, you know, uh, you know, freedom fighters?
[02:04:25.553 --> 02:04:26.574]  No, I wouldn't trust that.
[02:04:26.574 --> 02:04:29.815]  I wouldn't trust that very founder of that.
[02:04:29.815 --> 02:04:33.917]  Well, look, um, Arm and Hammer may be great.
[02:04:33.917 --> 02:04:34.457]  I don't know.
[02:04:34.457 --> 02:04:36.138]  So I shouldn't say anything about it.
[02:04:36.138 --> 02:04:38.039]  Uh, Tom's of Maine's pretty good.
[02:04:38.039 --> 02:04:40.460]  There's a lot of other brands I use.
[02:04:40.460 --> 02:04:41.740]  It's all great, Noel.
[02:04:41.740 --> 02:04:42.201]  Anything else?
[02:04:43.321 --> 02:04:45.583]  Uh, yeah, about healthcare, uh, telehealth.
[02:04:45.583 --> 02:04:49.927]  You need to look into that because RFID, the main component of that, it's in the healthcare bill.
[02:04:49.927 --> 02:04:55.292]  Lindsey Williams is right about RFID chips by the... No, no, I mean, we've written articles about it.
[02:04:55.292 --> 02:04:56.593]  Hey, listen, you're awesome.

[02:07:07.530 --> 02:07:12.654]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.

[02:08:01.727 --> 02:08:07.129]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:07.129 --> 02:08:10.950]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:10.950 --> 02:08:13.011]  It is the 15th day of March, 2010.
[02:08:13.011 --> 02:08:15.172]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:08:15.172 --> 02:08:21.974]  We're simulcasting the second half of the broadcast at PrisonPlanet.tv for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[02:08:21.974 --> 02:08:22.234]  Okay.
[02:08:24.056 --> 02:08:28.937]  I've got a lot of important news coming up, but I want to run through a bunch of calls until the bottom of the hour.
[02:08:28.937 --> 02:08:30.738]  I'm going to get back into fluoride.
[02:08:30.738 --> 02:08:33.059]  Big developments on that front.
[02:08:33.059 --> 02:08:37.600]  Also, this is an article here out of the Boston Herald.
[02:08:37.600 --> 02:08:40.621]  Child rape charge rocks TSA.
[02:08:40.621 --> 02:08:44.702]  Logan employee pats down air travelers at scan stations.
[02:08:45.643 --> 02:08:50.125]  Naked body scanner person charged with raping a child.
[02:08:50.125 --> 02:08:53.666]  Folks, who do you think is attracted to be a truancy officer?
[02:08:53.666 --> 02:08:56.927]  Who do you think is attracted to be a Boy Scout leader?
[02:08:56.927 --> 02:08:59.568]  Who do you think is attracted to be a CPS worker?
[02:08:59.568 --> 02:09:02.489]  Who do you think is attracted to be a TSA worker?
[02:09:02.489 --> 02:09:04.490]  I've watched the videos on the news and I've seen it myself.
[02:09:04.490 --> 02:09:05.951]  They now grab women's breasts.
[02:09:05.951 --> 02:09:07.851]  We were shown that video yesterday.
[02:09:07.851 --> 02:09:09.392]  They rub under the breast.
[02:09:10.932 --> 02:09:15.254]  And they grab your genitals and you see them on the news in front of cameras.
[02:09:15.254 --> 02:09:20.216]  They single out the hot blonde and put her in the body scanner and the guys all gather around and laugh.
[02:09:20.216 --> 02:09:22.157]  I mean, this is going on!
[02:09:23.695 --> 02:09:27.599]  Who do you think they hired for Abu Ghraib outside Baghdad?
[02:09:27.599 --> 02:09:32.045]  Who do you think they hired for Camp X-Ray in the internal CIA camp within the camp?
[02:09:32.045 --> 02:09:34.648]  The Marines that are there aren't really bad.
[02:09:34.648 --> 02:09:37.491]  They're just called from regular Marines, but the inner group.
[02:09:37.491 --> 02:09:43.898]  It came out in the news they hire fired federal and state jail guards who've been caught raping inmates.
[02:09:43.898 --> 02:09:44.359]  Sadist!
[02:09:45.734 --> 02:09:48.715]  I mean, you know, down in the dungeon they've got evil dungeon keepers.
[02:09:48.715 --> 02:09:50.576]  I mean, who else could do this?
[02:09:50.576 --> 02:09:56.017]  Even if people were evil and bad in dungeons, I wouldn't enjoy torturing them.
[02:09:56.017 --> 02:09:59.299]  Well, I'm not going to be a dungeon keeper.
[02:09:59.299 --> 02:10:00.319]  If somebody's really evil,
[02:10:01.605 --> 02:10:02.706]  And we've got all the proof.
[02:10:02.706 --> 02:10:03.566]  I say string them up.
[02:10:03.566 --> 02:10:04.927]  Let's just get them out of the way.
[02:10:04.927 --> 02:10:09.228]  And even if it was an evil person, I wouldn't enjoy seeing them hang from the end of a rope.
[02:10:09.228 --> 02:10:11.529]  It'd be like stepping on a cockroach.
[02:10:11.529 --> 02:10:14.671]  I turn the bathroom light on, there's some giant cockroach.
[02:10:14.671 --> 02:10:18.012]  I go, man, I don't want to have to stomp on this and pick up the guts.
[02:10:18.012 --> 02:10:21.534]  And even though I don't like cockroaches, it's a life form.
[02:10:21.534 --> 02:10:23.074]  I don't enjoy stomping on it.
[02:10:23.074 --> 02:10:28.677]  I just do it as quickly as possible, get some toilet paper, pick it up, throw it in the toilet, flush it, wash my hands.
[02:10:29.636 --> 02:10:33.178]  You know, it's 3 a.m., you get up to relieve your bladder, you stumble in.
[02:10:33.178 --> 02:10:34.539]  It's happened to everybody.
[02:10:34.539 --> 02:10:36.740]  You flip the light on, there's a giant cockroach on the wall.
[02:10:36.740 --> 02:10:38.941]  You're like, oh, you little creature.
[02:10:38.941 --> 02:10:41.263]  You pick a magazine up, splat.
[02:10:41.263 --> 02:10:43.084]  Well, there are a lot of people that enjoy that.
[02:10:43.084 --> 02:10:49.767]  It's like George W. Bush would stick firecrackers in the rear ends of toads.
[02:10:49.767 --> 02:10:54.050]  This is on record admitted, and enjoyed blowing their guts out everywhere.
[02:10:54.050 --> 02:10:55.991]  Jeffrey Dahmer enjoyed torturing animals.
[02:10:56.580 --> 02:10:59.763]  Now, then the globalists try to ban hunting, though, and say that's what that is.
[02:10:59.763 --> 02:11:00.083]  No.
[02:11:00.083 --> 02:11:02.104]  It isn't that you get off on shooting the deer.
[02:11:02.104 --> 02:11:06.908]  It's the natural instinct to go out and hunt, and to skin it, and then to eat it.
[02:11:06.908 --> 02:11:12.773]  Like a dog isn't being cruel when it wants to chase down, say, a rat.
[02:11:12.773 --> 02:11:14.534]  Dogs are even better than cats at actually ratting.
[02:11:14.534 --> 02:11:17.697]  If you get like a terrier, that's what they're bred for.
[02:11:17.697 --> 02:11:19.758]  To them, it's instinct, and they want to eat it.
[02:11:19.758 --> 02:11:20.479]  They're a carnivore.
[02:11:21.690 --> 02:11:29.193]  But people that like to get little animals and, you know, torture them and do things to them, something's wrong with them.
[02:11:29.193 --> 02:11:32.634]  And that's the type of people that end up in government.
[02:11:32.634 --> 02:11:35.855]  Now, am I saying every truancy officer is a pedophile?
[02:11:35.855 --> 02:11:37.335]  Absolutely not.
[02:11:37.335 --> 02:11:39.556]  Am I saying every jail guard's a sadist?
[02:11:39.556 --> 02:11:40.657]  Absolutely not.
[02:11:40.657 --> 02:11:47.199]  A lot of them are like my great-uncle, three-time retiree, 25 years in the Army as an officer, mid-level.
[02:11:49.178 --> 02:11:52.359]  He then went to work for the post office, I think, for 10 years.
[02:11:52.359 --> 02:11:56.960]  And then for another, what, 10, he was a state of Texas jail guard.
[02:11:56.960 --> 02:11:57.740]  And he got out.
[02:11:57.740 --> 02:11:58.960]  He said, oh, it's just horrible.
[02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:03.741]  He said some of the guards, you know, I've sat around eating dinner with him, some of the guards are worse than the inmates.
[02:12:03.741 --> 02:12:08.702]  And he talks about that, how that's why he got out of it.
[02:12:08.702 --> 02:12:17.424]  I mean, he said he got along with the prisoners and found that on most cases they were better than the guards and that the prisoners take care of the real scum, the really bad inmates.
[02:12:17.424 --> 02:12:18.884]  But look, side issue.
[02:12:20.117 --> 02:12:22.258]  So I'm not saying every jail guard's a bad person.
[02:12:22.258 --> 02:12:24.539]  A lot of them are just people that want a job.
[02:12:24.539 --> 02:12:34.285]  You know, they got plenty of money, they're a retiree, but you know, they're out of the army and they're 50 years old, they become a jail guard or whatever.
[02:12:34.285 --> 02:12:42.229]  In fact, there's a London Telegraph headline, Corrupt Prison Guards Fuel Drug Culture.
[02:12:42.229 --> 02:12:48.553]  And boy, my great uncle, he'll talk about how citizens are in there, in jail,
[02:12:49.705 --> 02:12:53.267]  In state prison for their first drunk driving charge.
[02:12:53.267 --> 02:12:54.787]  They don't get the right lawyer, it happens.
[02:12:54.787 --> 02:12:56.908]  And how the illegals are all above the law.
[02:12:56.908 --> 02:13:07.893]  And how they'll be nice family people, you name it, had three beers at the country club, got in their car, got pulled over, got convicted.
[02:13:07.893 --> 02:13:12.175]  He talked about a lot of people, first time offenders, side issue.
[02:13:14.284 --> 02:13:16.265]  I said I was going to get into this news.
[02:13:16.265 --> 02:13:23.890]  It's just a naked body scanner operator who has now been charged with raping a child.
[02:13:23.890 --> 02:13:27.772]  Folks, I read the newspaper every day.
[02:13:27.772 --> 02:13:28.813]  Every day!
[02:13:28.813 --> 02:13:30.194]  I scan over hundreds of papers.
[02:13:30.194 --> 02:13:31.254]  I got a whole staff doing it.
[02:13:31.254 --> 02:13:33.055]  They send me all this information.
[02:13:33.055 --> 02:13:35.097]  Listeners tweet these articles at me.
[02:13:35.097 --> 02:13:37.018]  I mean, I'm addicted just to reading it all.
[02:13:37.018 --> 02:13:43.642]  I see stuff every day or two without looking where top CPS workers are caught molesting children,
[02:13:44.983 --> 02:13:49.624]  Child porn, hardcore snuff films, you name it, and it swept under the rug.
[02:13:49.624 --> 02:14:01.946]  But then meanwhile, and even Walsh talked about this with Obama, about, it was weird, he said, you know, we're not talking about the sex offenders that get caught peeing at Mardi Gras.
[02:14:01.946 --> 02:14:05.707]  We're not talking about an 18-year-old who, you know, is dating a 16-year-old.
[02:14:05.707 --> 02:14:07.067]  Well, yes, you are.
[02:14:07.067 --> 02:14:08.747]  That's who most of the sex offenders are.
[02:14:08.747 --> 02:14:12.728]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have seen hundreds of news articles where people
[02:14:14.161 --> 02:14:20.466]  Pull over in the middle of a rural area and go pee behind a bush and the police pull up and arrest you and you are a sex offender.
[02:14:20.466 --> 02:14:33.576]  Ladies and gentlemen, I mean, if you live in Texas and you're driving 100, 200, 300 miles to go somewhere, how many, everybody's driving down the road and seeing cars pulled off and you see people behind the bushes.
[02:14:33.576 --> 02:14:36.619]  I mean, how many of you have peed behind the bushes?
[02:14:36.619 --> 02:14:41.022]  That is not sex offense.
[02:14:41.022 --> 02:14:41.683]  And then meanwhile,
[02:14:43.459 --> 02:14:44.540]  I'll never forget the Florida case.
[02:14:44.540 --> 02:14:47.162]  3,400 missing kids that CPS had taken.
[02:14:47.162 --> 02:14:53.747]  They found a bunch of them dead in different parts of the country, in shallow graves, heads cut off, all sorts of crazy stuff.
[02:14:53.747 --> 02:15:01.373]  And it turned out that the director was a pedophile, and then the next guy they hired was a pedophile, and the next guy they hired was... It's a pedophile group!
[02:15:01.373 --> 02:15:04.896]  And I'm telling you, it's the people running all these anti-pedophile groups.
[02:15:04.896 --> 02:15:05.937]  You can look at them.
[02:15:06.769 --> 02:15:09.631]  They've all got that weird little demonic look in their eyes.
[02:15:09.631 --> 02:15:10.311]  I don't know what it is.
[02:15:10.311 --> 02:15:12.533]  It's like a little... I mean, I can't even do the look.
[02:15:12.533 --> 02:15:22.360]  It's like a... It's like a... Let me try to... I can imitate almost anything, but it's hard to get the... It's like a... I don't know.
[02:15:22.360 --> 02:15:23.380]  I can't do it.
[02:15:23.380 --> 02:15:29.825]  Pull up... Pull up that Congressman Foley.
[02:15:29.825 --> 02:15:32.326]  Pull him up.
[02:15:32.326 --> 02:15:33.187]  Going after the pages.
[02:15:34.983 --> 02:15:37.905]  I mean, they've all got that look, and I'm telling you, it's incredible.
[02:15:37.905 --> 02:15:44.389]  I don't know what the... I don't know what... it's like a bug-eyed look, and they're always like... like demonic rats or something.
[02:15:44.389 --> 02:15:51.834]  And, of course, he was the head of the child abuse thing in Congress, and he was helping get all these laws passed, blah, blah, blah.
[02:15:51.834 --> 02:16:00.019]  Of course, when you've got people going after kids, they're going to be in the position of protecting the kids, because no one will believe that they're involved in it.
[02:16:00.019 --> 02:16:01.360]  Alright, I'm already ranting.
[02:16:01.360 --> 02:16:03.121]  By the way, Jason Burma's covered some of that in his...
[02:16:07.682 --> 02:16:10.783]  Invisible Empire film.
[02:16:10.783 --> 02:16:13.284]  Skip in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:16:13.284 --> 02:16:15.685]  Hey, Joe, how are you doing?
[02:16:15.685 --> 02:16:19.566]  I'm going to add just two things real quick.
[02:16:19.566 --> 02:16:25.068]  One, here's something I think we need to think about as far as the problem with Mexico.
[02:16:25.068 --> 02:16:31.970]  I'm a heavy haul driver and for years I've been bringing stuff out to Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas.
[02:16:32.338 --> 02:16:39.244]  They have built that base up over the last 10 years to house over 120,000 troops.
[02:16:39.244 --> 02:16:40.966]  There are no troops there.
[02:16:40.966 --> 02:16:46.651]  We are hauling huge cable that is being put into the ground.
[02:16:46.651 --> 02:16:49.654]  This is internet cable.
[02:16:49.654 --> 02:16:51.655]  It's satellite cable.
[02:16:51.655 --> 02:16:54.038]  It's over a foot in diameter.
[02:16:54.038 --> 02:16:55.439]  It's massive.
[02:16:55.439 --> 02:16:57.801]  And they're putting this cable in throughout the entire country.
[02:16:58.217 --> 02:16:58.918]  I don't know.
[02:17:14.795 --> 02:17:17.116]  They have built huge airstrips there.
[02:17:17.116 --> 02:17:18.716]  There are Russian aircraft there.
[02:17:18.716 --> 02:17:25.838]  I've seen the... No, listen, it's been all over the news that they're militarizing the border, but leaving it open to control the drugs coming in.
[02:17:25.838 --> 02:17:28.879]  It's part of the Napa superhighway system.
[02:17:28.879 --> 02:17:37.081]  They're building giant bases everywhere, and it's to keep the American people out, and to make sure all the illegals can come in.
[02:17:37.081 --> 02:17:42.503]  And one more thing, I would like your take on what's going on with Iran with the letter
[02:17:44.045 --> 02:17:47.450]  That Albert Pike wrote the three wars.
[02:17:47.450 --> 02:17:53.419]  The Third World War describes perfectly what they're doing in Iran, and I would like your two cents on that.
[02:17:53.419 --> 02:17:53.700]  Thank you.
[02:17:54.465 --> 02:17:56.947]  Well, they are trying to start World War III.
[02:17:56.947 --> 02:18:05.192]  The Rand Corporation last year said that the globalists need a new war, bigger than the Iraq War, to basically sell their new world order.
[02:18:05.192 --> 02:18:12.617]  Because during a war, even if the government's involved in tyranny, people tend to just hunker down, it's a primitive instinct, and just do what they're told.
[02:18:12.617 --> 02:18:17.560]  Because the real target is the United States to set up this domestic grid.
[02:18:17.560 --> 02:18:20.362]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ronnie in Texas.
[02:18:20.362 --> 02:18:21.063]  Ronnie, you're on the air.
[02:18:22.455 --> 02:18:32.839]  We've received the fluoride-free underwear patriot, but hey, seriously, the escalating Mexican drug war is our road to liberation, Alex.
[02:18:32.839 --> 02:18:35.700]  Because we can all agree, stop the killing.
[02:18:35.700 --> 02:18:40.282]  Stick to the Constitution, which, of course, like our Bill of Rights, was written on hemp paper.
[02:18:40.282 --> 02:18:43.543]  Stop the killing with freedom for farmers.
[02:18:43.543 --> 02:18:45.003]  The criminals have blown it.
[02:18:45.003 --> 02:18:51.646]  And here comes the freedom for farmers, because everyone can realize the idiocy now of this ongoing war on pot smokers and over
[02:18:52.219 --> 02:19:00.162]  Twenty-five percent of our jail now full of non-violent marijuana offenders, and fourteen states have already legalized medicinal marijuana.
[02:19:00.162 --> 02:19:12.387]  So we all can agree to stop the killing thanks to this Mexican drug-reward explosion that put it into the news, despite our usual news media blackout on this issue.
[02:19:12.387 --> 02:19:17.189]  So if absolute freedom for farmers is our best chance, you know, the 13 colonies started
[02:19:17.870 --> 02:19:18.712]  The whole thing over here.
[02:19:18.712 --> 02:19:23.342]  Now 14 states, the citizens have overwhelmingly voted to legalize themselves!
[02:19:24.962 --> 02:19:27.884]  And we're the government, we're the people.
[02:19:27.884 --> 02:19:33.649]  We can pass whatever law, repeal whatever law we want, as long as it doesn't violate somebody else's rights under the Bill of Rights.
[02:19:33.649 --> 02:19:35.871]  We're the boss, not the government.
[02:19:35.871 --> 02:19:46.520]  And the feds come into 14 states and say, no, you're not going to decriminalize marijuana, we're going to keep the drug war going so we can continue to make money off it, because when it's illegal they make bigger profits.
[02:19:46.520 --> 02:19:47.441]  Ronnie, good to hear from you.
[02:19:47.441 --> 02:19:49.242]  Mark, Leo, Scott, Patrick.
[02:19:50.063 --> 02:19:51.963]  Your calls are straight ahead.
[02:19:51.963 --> 02:20:01.646]  InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv are the websites.

[02:20:21.091 --> 02:20:25.153]  I already knew a bit about foraging and edibles, but you take it to a whole new level.
[02:20:25.153 --> 02:20:27.954]  A thousand thanks to you for all that great knowledge.
[02:20:27.954 --> 02:20:28.975]  It was empowering.
[02:20:28.975 --> 02:20:32.977]  When I was in the Navy, I went through a couple of quick land survival classes.

[02:22:09.763 --> 02:22:11.165]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:22:11.966 --> 02:22:14.547]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:22:14.547 --> 02:22:20.928]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:22:20.928 --> 02:22:26.470]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:22:26.470 --> 02:22:36.112]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:22:36.232 --> 02:22:38.575]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:22:38.575 --> 02:22:40.157]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:22:40.157 --> 02:22:42.619]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:22:42.619 --> 02:22:44.742]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:22:44.742 --> 02:22:46.284]  And right now in Washington, D.C.
[02:22:46.994 --> 02:22:49.876]  We have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:24:07.570 --> 02:24:09.631]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:24:11.476 --> 02:24:23.302]  What we have is a criminal class that makes a bunch of rules that make normal, regular, good people criminals, so the criminals have an excuse to put us in their prisons and have their way with us.
[02:24:23.302 --> 02:24:27.044]  Yeah, here's Foley's I Am Exchange with underage Paige.
[02:24:27.044 --> 02:24:29.226]  And that guy didn't get in any trouble.
[02:24:29.226 --> 02:24:34.288]  And he was running all the child programs to save children from perverts in Congress.
[02:24:37.659 --> 02:24:39.542]  I mean, you constantly hear about congressmen.
[02:24:39.542 --> 02:24:40.544]  Who was the other one?
[02:24:40.544 --> 02:24:43.009]  In the bathroom?
[02:24:43.009 --> 02:24:43.890]  Larry Craig?
[02:24:43.890 --> 02:24:46.235]  I mean, it's just...
[02:24:47.950 --> 02:24:51.011]  The issue is why is it so many of them?
[02:24:51.011 --> 02:24:54.632]  Because it's a club and that's who they let in.
[02:24:54.632 --> 02:24:58.353]  And so of course you've got Child Rape Charge Rocks TSA.
[02:24:58.353 --> 02:25:00.734]  This is out of the Boston Herald.
[02:25:00.734 --> 02:25:06.655]  Logan employee pats down air travelers at scan stations.
[02:25:06.655 --> 02:25:08.216]  This is where they have the naked body scanners.
[02:25:08.216 --> 02:25:09.276]  In fact, give me a document cam.
[02:25:09.276 --> 02:25:09.896]  There it is.
[02:25:09.896 --> 02:25:13.757]  Child Rape Charge Rocks TSA, Boston Herald.
[02:25:13.757 --> 02:25:15.198]  I'm gonna get more into this coming up.
[02:25:15.198 --> 02:25:15.438]  It's just
[02:25:17.526 --> 02:25:27.476]  Who wants a job for $15 an hour where you've got to squeeze women's breasts, grab men's genitals, and naked body scan children?
[02:25:27.476 --> 02:25:31.700]  I mean, you couldn't pay me a million dollars to do that.
[02:25:31.700 --> 02:25:36.264]  I mean, I don't like to inconvenience a waiter to say, hey, my food isn't good.
[02:25:36.264 --> 02:25:37.946]  I'll just tend to not go back to the restaurant.
[02:25:39.301 --> 02:25:44.144]  If my food's bad, because I don't like to get in people's faces unless they're in my face.
[02:25:44.144 --> 02:25:45.245]  But these people love it!
[02:25:45.245 --> 02:25:53.830]  I mean, day after day, hour after hour, week after week, month after month, year after year, searching and squeezing and scanning and getting in your face.
[02:25:53.830 --> 02:25:56.692]  Now, a lot of them are mainly veterans and people that just want a job.
[02:25:57.543 --> 02:25:58.804]  But a big percentage.
[02:25:58.804 --> 02:26:05.287]  I mean, we see the articles of them telling teenage girls, I want you to be my sex slave, so they get in trouble.
[02:26:05.287 --> 02:26:07.928]  Or going crazy saying, I'm God, I'm God.
[02:26:07.928 --> 02:26:09.389]  Remember a month ago?
[02:26:09.389 --> 02:26:12.411]  TSA worker just went insane and said, I'm God, I'm God!
[02:26:12.411 --> 02:26:15.933]  The airport was running around going so insane they had to arrest him.
[02:26:15.933 --> 02:26:17.934]  Just lunatics who want to be God.
[02:26:17.934 --> 02:26:21.015]  And so they are God in that airport.
[02:26:21.015 --> 02:26:25.798]  And you're going to be naked body scanned by a person who's been arrested for child rape.
[02:26:27.113 --> 02:26:29.615]  Alleged child rape.
[02:26:29.615 --> 02:26:32.517]  I mean, I'm telling you, these are perverts!
[02:26:32.517 --> 02:26:34.099]  I've seen the news footage.
[02:26:34.099 --> 02:26:35.940]  They don't even hide it!
[02:26:35.940 --> 02:26:48.150]  They pick the good-looking women out, send them in, and then just start going... And then in England, the movie star guy goes through the scanner, they print off his naked body, and ask him to come give them an autograph on it.
[02:26:52.639 --> 02:26:53.939]  That's the women.
[02:26:53.939 --> 02:26:59.640]  We're so dehumanized, women would record our naked body and then bring it to a man and say, sign this.
[02:26:59.640 --> 02:27:05.722]  And the guy was so cool, showing how men are a lot cooler on these issues than women, and signed it.
[02:27:05.722 --> 02:27:08.922]  I mean, he should have become absolutely outraged.
[02:27:08.922 --> 02:27:10.683]  Because what he did wasn't cool.
[02:27:10.683 --> 02:27:13.323]  He just thinks it's cool to just make a joke out of it.
[02:27:13.323 --> 02:27:14.564]  It was oppressive.
[02:27:14.564 --> 02:27:16.284]  It was a form of humiliation.
[02:27:18.410 --> 02:27:23.172]  And if it's already so bad today, where is it going next?
[02:27:23.172 --> 02:27:25.893]  Mark in Michigan, you're on the air.
[02:27:25.893 --> 02:27:36.577]  Hey Alex, I got a powerful idea I want to let loose, and you're the big point of contact for this whole thing.
[02:27:36.577 --> 02:27:43.120]  You know, a lot of people are waking up, but you know, we can't be so pure.
[02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:46.742]  If you forget that there's a lot of people on the left, you know, people like Naomi Wolf,
[02:27:48.143 --> 02:27:56.049]  I've met kids that are Democrats that are starting to get scared.
[02:27:56.049 --> 02:27:58.991]  I think it's time we organize.
[02:27:58.991 --> 02:28:03.735]  It's time for a real third party to get a point of agreement.
[02:28:03.735 --> 02:28:13.022]  Guys like Bob Barr, Baldwin, Paul, Ventura, Naomi Wolf is a great person to talk to lefties.
[02:28:13.022 --> 02:28:16.805]  I'd love to see your show put some of these guys together.
[02:28:17.577 --> 02:28:23.599]  Well, let me just say, I don't trust Bob Barr.
[02:28:23.599 --> 02:28:32.902]  And it's not just because he was CIA, it's that he now is this big patriot leader, but still has supported some bad things in the past.
[02:28:32.902 --> 02:28:40.005]  Not because he's former CIA, there's some good guys out there, analysts and people, like Ray McGovern, who's got a good track record, and are for real.
[02:28:40.005 --> 02:28:42.986]  Naomi Wolf was a Rhodes Scholar, she's come on the show.
[02:28:43.866 --> 02:28:45.407]  She stood up against Bush's corruption.
[02:28:45.407 --> 02:28:48.688]  She started speaking out against Obama, so that's a feather in her cap.
[02:28:48.688 --> 02:28:51.069]  But I do think we should be nonpartisan about this.
[02:28:51.069 --> 02:28:54.650]  I mean, my whole issue is about shattering the left-right paradigm.
[02:28:54.650 --> 02:29:05.674]  But more than just a third party, we need to just run through the Republican and Democratic system or third party, whatever works for you locally, use the party machinery to get in as a constitutionalist.
[02:29:05.674 --> 02:29:06.615]  Kind of like Deborah Medina.
[02:29:07.475 --> 02:29:12.217]  She's more of a libertarian, but run as a Republican because that's the party that has the best chance of winning in Texas.
[02:29:12.217 --> 02:29:12.957]  It's just a label.
[02:29:12.957 --> 02:29:13.937]  It means nothing.
[02:29:13.937 --> 02:29:16.158]  But I do agree with you.
[02:29:16.158 --> 02:29:20.279]  But, you know, just to get these people to just agree on five things.
[02:29:20.279 --> 02:29:24.661]  The Bill of Rights, the paper ballot, and the Fed, and the war, secure the borders.
[02:29:24.661 --> 02:29:24.961]  I agree.
[02:29:24.961 --> 02:29:26.521]  Forget about all this other stuff.
[02:29:26.521 --> 02:29:28.122]  I agree, and you're right.
[02:29:28.122 --> 02:29:31.323]  A lot of lefties that were in love with Obama have now woken up.
[02:29:31.323 --> 02:29:33.284]  In fact, the majority of them in polls.
[02:29:33.284 --> 02:29:34.124]  And they're really getting
[02:29:35.435 --> 02:29:36.616]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:36.616 --> 02:29:38.078]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.153 --> 02:30:06.175]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:30:06.175 --> 02:30:09.416]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:30:09.416 --> 02:30:14.218]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:30:14.218 --> 02:30:20.601]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:30:20.601 --> 02:30:22.842]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:30:23.382 --> 02:30:23.682]  Tim Geithner?
[02:30:23.682 --> 02:30:24.182]  Bernanke?
[02:30:24.182 --> 02:30:24.862]  They're arsonists!
[02:30:24.862 --> 02:30:26.143]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:30:26.143 --> 02:30:28.383]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:30:42.287 --> 02:30:49.557]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:30:49.557 --> 02:30:58.689]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:31:02.571 --> 02:31:06.552]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:06.552 --> 02:31:15.414]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:31:15.414 --> 02:31:20.035]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:31:20.035 --> 02:31:30.857]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:31:31.477 --> 02:31:40.999]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:40.999 --> 02:31:46.421]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:31:46.421 --> 02:31:53.902]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:53.902 --> 02:31:56.663]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:32:00.506 --> 02:32:05.050]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:05.050 --> 02:32:05.970]  Number 1.
[02:32:05.970 --> 02:32:09.393]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:09.393 --> 02:32:10.254]  Number 2.
[02:32:10.254 --> 02:32:15.137]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:15.137 --> 02:32:15.898]  It's true.
[02:32:15.898 --> 02:32:20.762]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:20.762 --> 02:32:21.582]  Number 3.
[02:32:21.582 --> 02:32:25.185]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:25.185 --> 02:32:28.868]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:29.068 --> 02:32:29.869]  Number 4.
[02:32:29.869 --> 02:32:32.631]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:32.631 --> 02:32:36.313]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:36.313 --> 02:32:37.094]  Number 5.
[02:32:37.094 --> 02:32:41.257]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:41.257 --> 02:32:46.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:46.300 --> 02:32:50.464]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:50.464 --> 02:32:52.266]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:52.266 --> 02:32:54.509]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[02:33:16.622 --> 02:33:16.822]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:33:16.822 --> 02:33:21.928]  We're going to have open phones throughout the rest of the broadcast and start getting into more of these stacks of news here.
[02:33:34.560 --> 02:33:41.369]  I wanted, before we go back to your calls, to thank some of the sponsors that have made today's radio show possible.
[02:33:41.369 --> 02:33:49.961]  The number one funding mechanism, of course, is the books and DVDs and Patriot t-shirts we sell at InfoWars.com.
[02:33:49.961 --> 02:33:51.623]  Great books, great films, excellent...
[02:33:52.364 --> 02:34:05.597]  Clothing where you'll meet like-minded people and it's a great way to wear an InfoWars.com ball cap or bumper stickers are free with all the orders the t-shirts all available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139 888-253-3139 You can also write to me InfoWars P.O.
[02:34:05.597 --> 02:34:06.057]  Box 19549 Austin, Texas 78760
[02:34:18.646 --> 02:34:18.886]  P.O.
[02:34:18.886 --> 02:34:24.947]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[02:34:24.947 --> 02:34:30.329]  And don't forget you can now pre-order Jason Bermas' new film.
[02:34:30.329 --> 02:34:31.689]  You'll be the first to get it.
[02:34:31.689 --> 02:34:34.630]  We ship the orders out and the order they're received.
[02:34:34.630 --> 02:34:37.150]  April 15th, ladies and gentlemen, is the DVD drop date.
[02:34:37.150 --> 02:34:41.951]  It'll also premiere at PrisonPlanet.tv in super high quality for all the members.
[02:34:41.951 --> 02:34:44.192]  Invisible Empire, a new order to find.
[02:34:44.192 --> 02:34:45.672]  And then seven days later,
[02:34:47.642 --> 02:35:03.297]  On the 21st, we release Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, my newest film that I directed with Rob Dew and Jason Douglas.
[02:35:03.297 --> 02:35:04.819]  Film turned out really powerful.
[02:35:05.913 --> 02:35:07.174]  Just look at all the stuff that's happening.
[02:35:07.174 --> 02:35:09.736]  It's unfortunate that everything we talked about came true.
[02:35:09.736 --> 02:35:11.918]  In fact, give me a document cam shot.
[02:35:11.918 --> 02:35:14.220]  This will be up in the next few hours.
[02:35:14.220 --> 02:35:18.984]  You can already pre-order Invisible Empire, but this will be up for pre-order in the next few hours.
[02:35:18.984 --> 02:35:23.708]  Here's the cover that's been sent off to be printed with the DVDs.
[02:35:23.708 --> 02:35:27.371]  Police state for the rise of FEMA.
[02:35:27.371 --> 02:35:28.432]  Tyranny is here.
[02:35:28.432 --> 02:35:31.035]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:35:33.956 --> 02:35:39.777]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth, and it's only getting worse.
[02:35:39.777 --> 02:35:44.978]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[02:35:44.978 --> 02:35:52.560]  Veteran documentary filmmaker Alex Jones conclusively proves the existence of secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:35:52.560 --> 02:35:57.681]  The military industrial complex is transforming our once free nation into a giant prison camp.
[02:35:57.681 --> 02:36:02.762]  A cashless society control grid constructed in the name of fighting terrorism has actually been built.
[02:36:03.482 --> 02:36:03.983]  We're good to go.
[02:36:17.813 --> 02:36:42.435]  ...has established an all-powerful shadow state, prepared to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, FEMA camps, and a shredded Constitution, witnessed police and military savagely attacking innocent citizens as our own government unleashes false flag operations to justify its oppression, then watches Alex Jones takes on corrupt mercenary police and exposes mainstream media brainwashing, i.e.
[02:36:43.447 --> 02:36:44.988]  Glenn Beck.
[02:36:44.988 --> 02:36:48.551]  It is police state for the rise of FEMA.
[02:36:48.551 --> 02:36:50.372]  Pre-sales start today.
[02:36:50.372 --> 02:36:53.695]  That ships out on or before April 21st.
[02:36:53.695 --> 02:36:54.615]  And why do you want to order now?
[02:36:54.615 --> 02:36:55.776]  So you get it first.
[02:36:55.776 --> 02:36:58.879]  It's shipped out in the order it is received.
[02:36:58.879 --> 02:36:59.859]  We've gotten pretty quick now.
[02:36:59.859 --> 02:37:02.662]  We can ship out the pre-orders within four days.
[02:37:03.732 --> 02:37:09.216]  And so we try to start shipping two or three days before, so basically almost everybody gets it on that date or a little bit after.
[02:37:09.216 --> 02:37:14.100]  And again, your purchase of these books and DVDs, materials, makes what we do here possible.
[02:37:14.100 --> 02:37:20.145]  It's all available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:37:20.145 --> 02:37:23.387]  Or you can, again, write to me, InfoWars, P.O.
[02:37:23.387 --> 02:37:27.050]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760.
[02:37:27.050 --> 02:37:28.992]  Okay, let's go back to the calls.
[02:37:28.992 --> 02:37:30.593]  Leo in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[02:37:32.056 --> 02:37:32.956]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:37:32.956 --> 02:37:34.017]  How are you?
[02:37:34.017 --> 02:37:35.277]  Oh, man, I am tired today.
[02:37:35.277 --> 02:37:36.858]  That's all I'm doing.
[02:37:36.858 --> 02:37:42.160]  Listen, everything that you just mentioned about all these things that are going on... Do me a huge favor.
[02:37:42.160 --> 02:37:43.260]  Turn your radio off, man.
[02:37:43.260 --> 02:37:46.922]  I really want to be able to hear you.
[02:37:46.922 --> 02:37:47.902]  It's off.
[02:37:47.902 --> 02:37:48.562]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:37:48.562 --> 02:37:50.963]  Anyway, now it's off.
[02:37:50.963 --> 02:37:57.746]  Anyway, everything you just mentioned, of course, is stark naked reality that we all have to deal with in this world.
[02:37:57.746 --> 02:38:00.026]  But there's a new one you can add to it.
[02:38:00.026 --> 02:38:01.387]  They're sending notices out.
[02:38:02.171 --> 02:38:12.413]  All the veterans that are, like I'm on a service-connected pension with the VA, they're sending notices out to all the veterans telling you gotta come in for testing.
[02:38:12.413 --> 02:38:22.175]  Now, my letter didn't state this, but I have a few friends of mine that the letter stated that if they didn't show up for the testing, that they were going to stop their money.
[02:38:22.175 --> 02:38:25.976]  So you see, here's another way... Now you're talking... Well, I mean, I've seen this.
[02:38:25.976 --> 02:38:27.576]  Clinton started this.
[02:38:27.576 --> 02:38:28.897]  It was 89,000 names of vets.
[02:38:31.420 --> 02:38:36.884]  Who they claimed had PTSD from Vietnam and Korea and Desert Storm in 98.
[02:38:36.884 --> 02:38:39.906]  No, no, that was 99.
[02:38:39.906 --> 02:38:47.031]  And suddenly it was, no, no, it was, it was, no, it was, yeah, it was 99.
[02:38:47.031 --> 02:38:49.153]  Suddenly they couldn't buy firearms.
[02:38:50.419 --> 02:38:52.000]  And no judge, no jury.
[02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:56.844]  Now they have the no-fly, no-buy bill they want to pass, where if they put you on a no-fly list, you can't buy guns.
[02:38:56.844 --> 02:38:58.966]  No judge, no jury, no conviction.
[02:38:58.966 --> 02:39:08.294]  And yes, I've been getting calls about these letters in the last month that they're telling them, you've got to come in for PTSD to see if you've got PTSD, and then an unelected quack
[02:39:08.894 --> 02:39:09.174]  Exactly.
[02:39:09.174 --> 02:39:15.081]  You know, what they're trying to do, in my opinion, is they're trying to control every one of us in some way or fashion.
[02:39:29.158 --> 02:39:33.923]  Yeah, if they can't get you in the criminal justice system, they want to get you in the credit system, bankrupt.
[02:39:33.923 --> 02:39:36.606]  Or they want to get you in the psychological system.
[02:39:36.606 --> 02:39:37.967]  This is how they take your rights.
[02:39:37.967 --> 02:39:39.449]  They designate everyone as bad.
[02:39:39.449 --> 02:39:40.570]  Go ahead.
[02:39:40.570 --> 02:39:47.638]  But anyway, you know, the bottom line is, is that what I'm trying to do right now is get together with a lot of veterans
[02:39:48.214 --> 02:39:58.317]  And then I don't mean I don't really know what approach to take if I mean it's useless to go to a politician and ask one of them to try to support us because you know they're just going to sell us down.
[02:39:58.317 --> 02:40:07.740]  Well let me say this Leo and then I want to shut up and let you have a few minutes to actually lay out what your friend told you but it's like the last two three months
[02:40:09.264 --> 02:40:12.908]  We keep getting calls from scared women, mainly.
[02:40:12.908 --> 02:40:19.354]  And being a talk show host for 14 plus years, you really learn to gauge if someone's being truthful about 99% of the time.
[02:40:19.354 --> 02:40:24.199]  You can tell when somebody's feeding you a line of bull by what they say, how they say it, their tone.
[02:40:24.199 --> 02:40:29.145]  But when you have woman after woman after woman, or cops, I've had cops calling on air.
[02:40:29.665 --> 02:40:35.769]  Yeah, we're down here, we're not supposed to talk about it, there are weird Russian helicopters flying around, and I'm like, who's in them?
[02:40:35.769 --> 02:40:38.991]  I don't know, they just look like Russian helicopters off TV.
[02:40:38.991 --> 02:40:41.633]  They're white, they're gray, they're black.
[02:40:41.633 --> 02:40:44.695]  Caller after caller, a lot of you heard them here on air.
[02:40:44.695 --> 02:40:54.942]  And then it comes out, San Antonio Express News, video of it, Russian helicopters flown by the Mexican Navy, European helicopters flown by the Mexican Army, you know, five, six miles over the U.S.
[02:40:54.942 --> 02:40:57.084]  border, hovering over houses,
[02:40:58.303 --> 02:40:59.763]  I knew that was true when I heard it.
[02:40:59.763 --> 02:41:03.064]  It's like when a preacher called me and said, I've got secret FEMA documents.
[02:41:03.064 --> 02:41:04.024]  This is really scary.
[02:41:04.024 --> 02:41:07.145]  They called us in and said, teach your flock for martial law.
[02:41:07.145 --> 02:41:10.486]  I could tell the guy was telling the truth, but we got the documents, called the phone numbers.
[02:41:10.486 --> 02:41:11.286]  It was real.
[02:41:11.286 --> 02:41:12.986]  FEMA was very upset that we had it.
[02:41:12.986 --> 02:41:17.087]  I knew when cops sent me the Homeland Security document last year and the MIAC report.
[02:41:17.087 --> 02:41:18.587]  I knew it was real when I saw it.
[02:41:18.587 --> 02:41:22.148]  I knew these were real cops when I was talking to them off air on the phone.
[02:41:22.148 --> 02:41:24.589]  But I still called the FBI and found out it was real.
[02:41:24.589 --> 02:41:25.569]  They got real mad I had it.
[02:41:26.309 --> 02:41:35.196]  So, I mean, I've learned when something's real, and so I can tell you're telling the truth, and I've gotten a bunch of calls and emails about this, but people need to do the next step.
[02:41:35.196 --> 02:41:43.462]  They need to send a showtips at InfoWars.com, or Aaron at InfoWars.com, CC it to a few of us, because we miss some stuff, there's so much, thousands a day.
[02:41:45.155 --> 02:42:00.760]  Someone needs to black out their name, black out their social security numbers, all that stuff, and they need to email it to us right now because we know it was in the news that they're just suddenly putting veterans on lists where they can't own guns.
[02:42:00.760 --> 02:42:08.562]  We know they're calling veterans in at their regular checkups if they volunteer for it and declaring a mentally ill to take their rights away without a court.
[02:42:08.562 --> 02:42:11.322]  And they don't have a law to do that under the Second Amendment.
[02:42:11.322 --> 02:42:12.623]  Now that they have the instant check,
[02:42:13.590 --> 02:42:16.251]  You can't get the gun because the FBI says no.
[02:42:16.251 --> 02:42:17.512]  It's illegal.
[02:42:17.512 --> 02:42:21.374]  And that's why they want to shut down private sales, because veterans can still get guns that way.
[02:42:21.374 --> 02:42:23.916]  So I need people right now.
[02:42:23.916 --> 02:42:31.019]  In fact, when I'm done with Leo, Scott, Patrick and Jason and Stacey, I am not going to take any more calls for about 20 minutes.
[02:42:31.019 --> 02:42:35.262]  We're just going to open the phones up specifically for veterans that this has happened to.
[02:42:36.531 --> 02:42:39.493]  And so, you can read it on air, your letter.
[02:42:39.493 --> 02:42:41.254]  Because let's just confirm this right now.
[02:42:41.254 --> 02:42:42.655]  I know what's going on.
[02:42:42.655 --> 02:42:43.936]  I've had a bunch of calls and emails.
[02:42:43.936 --> 02:42:45.737]  I know they've done some of this in the past.
[02:42:45.737 --> 02:42:47.178]  But I want the bonafide.
[02:42:47.178 --> 02:42:47.838]  I want the proof.
[02:42:47.838 --> 02:42:49.299]  Because this is big news.
[02:42:49.299 --> 02:42:52.101]  And we'll get a story up at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:42:52.101 --> 02:42:53.322]  Now, I'm going to shut up, Leo.
[02:42:53.322 --> 02:42:54.062]  You've got two minutes.
[02:42:54.062 --> 02:42:55.243]  Tell me what your friend was telling you.
[02:42:55.788 --> 02:43:06.370]  He was telling me that it's obvious to him that he had never went to the VA before, okay, about any problems with PTSD or any physical problems.
[02:43:06.370 --> 02:43:08.371]  He was just a normal veteran.
[02:43:08.371 --> 02:43:17.633]  So obviously what's happening is they're going back through the records and they're investigating all of us to find out what we did in Vietnam.
[02:43:17.633 --> 02:43:24.314]  So once they know what we did, then they figure that we have to be into a category where something has to be wrong with us.
[02:43:24.867 --> 02:43:32.251]  And if you're not coming to them and asking them for help in one way or another, then they feel as if you're a dissident.
[02:43:32.251 --> 02:43:37.074]  And that's probably what they're doing to be able to get control of dissidents.
[02:43:37.074 --> 02:43:40.656]  To find out who's who and what position you're taking.
[02:43:40.656 --> 02:43:49.661]  This letter states to me that I'm to report Friday, April 2nd at 3 o'clock for a mis-body image test.
[02:43:49.661 --> 02:43:50.622]  To test my body.
[02:43:51.294 --> 02:43:52.515]  For what reason?
[02:43:52.515 --> 02:43:54.155]  I never set this appointment up.
[02:43:54.155 --> 02:44:02.739]  I never asked for nothing like this, but you're sending all of us letters like this, telling us that we have to come in for this body imaging testing.
[02:44:02.739 --> 02:44:05.700]  Now, what does that tell you?
[02:44:05.700 --> 02:44:16.845]  Well, I know that over 10 years ago, Prada's in New York and others, big high-end clothing lines, put body scanners in, just like the airports.
[02:44:18.015 --> 02:44:19.757]  The same companies, actually.
[02:44:19.757 --> 02:44:22.501]  This was in the New York Times.
[02:44:22.501 --> 02:44:25.726]  And when you go in, it says, this gives you the ultimate fitting.
[02:44:25.726 --> 02:44:32.815]  You come in, we scan you, and then, this is when this was first coming out, they then have computerized assembly lines.
[02:44:33.456 --> 02:44:37.758]  That make the suit or the dress fit you exactly.
[02:44:37.758 --> 02:44:41.679]  But then it turned out, separately, it was getting a biometric scan of your body.
[02:44:41.679 --> 02:44:49.962]  Just like they take blood from babies at birth secretly for the Pentagon for 37 years and just claim, oh, it's blood testing for your baby.
[02:44:49.962 --> 02:44:51.902]  No, it's sent off to the Health Department and then the Pentagon.
[02:44:51.902 --> 02:44:52.503]  There it is.
[02:44:52.503 --> 02:44:55.984]  Body scanner replaces the tailor's tape measure.
[02:44:55.984 --> 02:44:57.404]  Wow, you guys are quick.
[02:44:57.404 --> 02:45:00.765]  When was that New York Times article?
[02:45:00.765 --> 02:45:02.186]  How did you guys do that in 10 seconds?
[02:45:04.229 --> 02:45:05.390]  Oh yeah, August 99.
[02:45:05.390 --> 02:45:06.691]  I said 10 years ago.
[02:45:06.691 --> 02:45:07.452]  Look at my memory.
[02:45:07.452 --> 02:45:11.635]  I'm not bragging, folks, but people think I make stuff up because I can just rattle it off.
[02:45:11.635 --> 02:45:12.396]  I don't know.
[02:45:12.396 --> 02:45:13.677]  Look.
[02:45:13.677 --> 02:45:16.199]  Body scanner replaces a tailor's tape measure.
[02:45:16.199 --> 02:45:19.241]  So I have read they are scanning veterans to get your biometric scan.
[02:45:19.241 --> 02:45:21.063]  Now, why is this important?
[02:45:21.063 --> 02:45:24.565]  They've got top-down heat resonance.
[02:45:24.565 --> 02:45:29.970]  Just by scanning the top of your head, even through your hair, it's like a fingerprint.
[02:45:29.970 --> 02:45:30.110]  It's 100%.
[02:45:31.656 --> 02:45:35.579]  And they've got top-down satellites, look-down satellites.
[02:45:35.579 --> 02:45:37.941]  This is the big secret weapon Bob Woodward wrote about in his book.
[02:45:37.941 --> 02:45:40.563]  It's now been partially declassified.
[02:45:40.563 --> 02:45:49.770]  And so once they ID you with the heat resonance, then they have that fingerprint, because it's an exact heat resonance that your head gives off.
[02:45:49.770 --> 02:45:54.053]  They can then top-down with a satellite, even look through clouds.
[02:45:54.053 --> 02:45:55.454]  Okay, because this is a heat resonance.
[02:45:55.454 --> 02:45:56.314]  That's how strong these are.
[02:45:56.314 --> 02:46:00.458]  Through clouds, you're walking in a parking lot and they go, that's Alex Jones.
[02:46:01.354 --> 02:46:02.634]  Okay, so they've got that.
[02:46:02.634 --> 02:46:04.675]  Then they've also got biometric walk.
[02:46:04.675 --> 02:46:12.057]  You think they can get your number just off a thumbprint and the six numbers they calculate for a measurement or a face scan template?
[02:46:12.057 --> 02:46:13.118]  Everybody has a walk.
[02:46:13.118 --> 02:46:16.459]  Like, I've had a broken, you know, leg, compound fracture.
[02:46:18.010 --> 02:46:20.512]  And, uh, my doctor died right after the surgery.
[02:46:20.512 --> 02:46:21.974]  I never got the pin and screws out.
[02:46:21.974 --> 02:46:27.999]  So when I don't think about it, I have to make myself not limp just because the foot's all shaped wrong.
[02:46:27.999 --> 02:46:34.465]  And, uh, so, so I have that, you know, I kind of walk like a gorilla sometimes unless I make myself, you know, walk.
[02:46:35.606 --> 02:46:42.534]  The issue is, is that just off that, they can get a biometric reading 100% just off my one leg.
[02:46:42.534 --> 02:46:48.641]  And see, they'll have a camera that knows the biomechanical movement of Alex Jones's right leg.
[02:46:48.641 --> 02:46:52.966]  Now with the body, once they have this with a body scan, they can
[02:46:54.178 --> 02:46:54.558]  We're good to go.
[02:47:09.076 --> 02:47:12.480]  All this looking for bombs stuff has nothing to do with it.
[02:47:12.480 --> 02:47:15.623]  Just like when they tell you at the health department, oh, this is a blood test for your baby.
[02:47:15.623 --> 02:47:16.023]  No, it's not.
[02:47:16.023 --> 02:47:17.345]  It's a eugenics test.
[02:47:17.345 --> 02:47:19.567]  But I'm ranting here.
[02:47:19.567 --> 02:47:20.428]  Print me that New York Times.
[02:47:20.428 --> 02:47:21.469]  That's a blast from the past.
[02:47:21.469 --> 02:47:24.792]  I called it, I said, 10 years ago, New York Times, body scanners.
[02:47:24.792 --> 02:47:25.393]  Oh, here it is.
[02:47:25.393 --> 02:47:25.833]  You brought it to me?
[02:47:26.670 --> 02:47:27.250]  Look at this.
[02:47:27.250 --> 02:47:28.811]  Show folks a document cam shot.
[02:47:28.811 --> 02:47:31.192]  Body scanner replaces the tailor's tape measure.
[02:47:31.192 --> 02:47:33.353]  Now, let's expand on that.
[02:47:33.353 --> 02:47:44.117]  Remember last year, all of the Veterans of Foreign Wars outfits were told, we don't care if you have a 150-year-old Civil War cannon, you're gonna register it with us, and we may basically take them.
[02:47:44.117 --> 02:47:45.217]  Remember that?
[02:47:45.217 --> 02:47:48.879]  Remember that, Leo?
[02:47:48.879 --> 02:47:53.861]  Well, you know, the bottom line is that I know that you're a very good, moral, decent person.
[02:47:54.557 --> 02:48:00.422]  I meant to tell you we saw you on IFC, the Independent Film Channel, the other night on a program.
[02:48:00.422 --> 02:48:05.626]  Or, you know, the Illuminati and the globalists and the elitists and all these things were being discussed.
[02:48:05.626 --> 02:48:07.828]  And it's nice to see you on mainstream media.
[02:48:07.828 --> 02:48:17.496]  You know, I've been listening to you, me and my friend, for many years, trying to get insight on how to live our lives based on all the problems that are in the world.
[02:48:18.021 --> 02:48:34.358]  And I can only tell you that, of everything that I've heard, I just want to say to everybody that's listening today, that the most important thing is, is to accept your higher power, Almighty God, the Lord Jesus Christ, whatever it is, because His plan is starting to come about.
[02:48:34.358 --> 02:48:41.265]  And the only thing that we can do is try to live our lives as best we possibly can until the man pulls the chain.
[02:48:42.068 --> 02:48:43.349]  And I know you're a busy man.
[02:48:43.349 --> 02:48:45.470]  I don't want to take a lot of your time off.
[02:48:45.470 --> 02:48:57.439]  But before you go with me today, could you put me on with someone there in your office where I can get some information, where we can start getting some films that we can start passing out to our neighbors?
[02:48:58.780 --> 02:48:59.520]  Well, I'm not sure.
[02:48:59.520 --> 02:49:02.101]  I mean, all my films are free online.
[02:49:02.101 --> 02:49:04.882]  They're in higher quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:49:04.882 --> 02:49:10.683]  And people are authorized to make copies of my films, but I can put you on hold and see what you need with John.
[02:49:10.683 --> 02:49:12.284]  Yeah, here it is, BBC.
[02:49:12.284 --> 02:49:15.885]  Camera looks through clothing.
[02:49:15.885 --> 02:49:21.926]  Camera that can see explosives, drugs, weapons, hiding under clothing from 25 meters has been invented.
[02:49:21.926 --> 02:49:24.227]  And if memory serves, this doesn't have a date.
[02:49:24.227 --> 02:49:26.528]  I think this was a few years old here.
[02:49:26.528 --> 02:49:27.388]  What's the date on that?
[02:49:31.005 --> 02:49:32.926]  2008, yeah, a few years ago.
[02:49:32.926 --> 02:49:33.927]  It hasn't been invented.
[02:49:33.927 --> 02:49:35.068]  They've had this for a decade.
[02:49:35.068 --> 02:49:37.269]  This is up all over the place.
[02:49:37.269 --> 02:49:41.392]  And see, that's why I start ranting, because I just want to warn people.
[02:49:41.392 --> 02:49:45.915]  Do folks realize how evil this is?
[02:49:45.915 --> 02:49:49.998]  And yes, they're calling the veterans in.
[02:49:49.998 --> 02:49:51.559]  They act like you're a friend.
[02:49:51.559 --> 02:49:53.120]  They say, oh, do you ever get angry?
[02:49:53.120 --> 02:49:54.121]  You ever get frustrated?
[02:49:54.121 --> 02:49:54.841]  You having trouble?
[02:49:54.841 --> 02:49:57.543]  And they say, yeah, I get angry.
[02:49:57.543 --> 02:49:58.144]  I get upset.
[02:49:58.144 --> 02:49:59.685]  You know, my ex-wife's doing this and that.
[02:50:00.981 --> 02:50:09.644]  You know, I'm drinking too much, and the shrink's sitting there going, oh, I'm your friend, and you're going to lose your Second Amendment.
[02:50:09.644 --> 02:50:10.464]  It's totally illegal.
[02:50:10.464 --> 02:50:11.765]  They're doing it.
[02:50:11.765 --> 02:50:13.445]  And they admit they're spying on veterans.
[02:50:13.445 --> 02:50:16.266]  They're worried about you, because you know how to kill.
[02:50:16.266 --> 02:50:17.407]  You know how to defend yourself.
[02:50:17.407 --> 02:50:20.408]  You know it's not that big of a deal, that life is quick.
[02:50:21.516 --> 02:50:23.297]  They're scared of you, okay?
[02:50:23.297 --> 02:50:25.999]  I mean, they understand that you've been in it.
[02:50:25.999 --> 02:50:36.885]  And they're a bunch of cowardly control freaks, and all their black uniforms are meant to bolster them up, and their black ski mask and their armor, because they're scared of real men.
[02:50:36.885 --> 02:50:39.187]  And they're scared to death of you.
[02:50:39.187 --> 02:50:41.768]  And it's like when you go in to have a baby.
[02:50:41.768 --> 02:50:45.731]  They have the nurse get the man out of the room and ask your wife, are you having money troubles?
[02:50:45.731 --> 02:50:47.252]  Is your husband mean to you?
[02:50:47.252 --> 02:50:49.213]  She doesn't tell you, she's about to call the CPS.
[02:50:50.708 --> 02:50:52.248]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:50:52.248 --> 02:50:54.789]  On the other side, we'll continue with the phone calls.
[02:50:54.789 --> 02:50:57.890]  And I've got all this news to get to, but I do enjoy your calls.
[02:50:57.890 --> 02:51:02.472]  Stay with us.
[02:51:02.472 --> 02:51:13.375]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[02:51:13.375 --> 02:51:17.536]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[02:51:17.536 --> 02:51:19.277]  It's called heart and body extract.
[02:51:19.677 --> 02:51:25.322]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:25.322 --> 02:51:35.349]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[02:51:35.349 --> 02:51:41.834]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[02:51:41.834 --> 02:51:45.197]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for a diabetic.
[02:51:45.197 --> 02:51:47.258]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[02:51:47.258 --> 02:51:49.260]  It simply needs some help so it has the
[02:51:49.400 --> 02:51:50.100]  We're good.
[02:52:12.498 --> 02:52:15.181]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:15.181 --> 02:52:21.566]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:21.566 --> 02:52:26.771]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:26.771 --> 02:52:36.760]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:36.860 --> 02:52:39.201]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:39.201 --> 02:52:40.802]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:40.802 --> 02:52:43.263]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:43.263 --> 02:52:45.384]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:45.384 --> 02:52:50.526]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:54:00.781 --> 02:54:15.468]  Millions of spring breakers are taking their
[02:54:17.992 --> 02:54:22.295]  Saved money from working at the pizza shop in college.
[02:54:22.295 --> 02:54:25.297]  High school graduates and others are flooding New Mexico.
[02:54:25.297 --> 02:54:30.040]  They're not carding down there for all the drunk 18-year-olds.
[02:54:30.040 --> 02:54:34.903]  Spring break, booze, babes, and bodyguards.
[02:54:34.903 --> 02:54:37.765]  Booze, babes, and bodyguards.
[02:54:37.765 --> 02:54:40.807]  And it talks about all the Americans being slaughtered en masse March 15, 2010.
[02:54:43.251 --> 02:54:44.512]  ABC News, here's another one.
[02:54:44.512 --> 02:54:49.034]  LA Times in Mexico, 13 killed in Acapulco areas, 11 others elsewhere.
[02:54:49.034 --> 02:55:00.199]  And it just talks about all the death and Americans being killed and embassy officials being slaughtered.
[02:55:00.199 --> 02:55:02.440]  It just goes on and on.
[02:55:02.440 --> 02:55:04.741]  Everybody can't wait to race down there and get killed.
[02:55:04.741 --> 02:55:05.562]  Here it is.
[02:55:05.562 --> 02:55:06.362]  Mexico!
[02:55:06.362 --> 02:55:08.423]  Gunmen kill American consulate staff.
[02:55:08.423 --> 02:55:12.165]  I mean, this is worse than Guatemala in the 70s and 80s, but hey, let's
[02:55:13.268 --> 02:55:15.910]  A lot of parents are paying to send their children to Mexico.
[02:55:15.910 --> 02:55:26.037]  I mean, unless you're going somewhere like Ventura is, or in the mountains or something, or where there's nobody, you shouldn't be going to Mexico.
[02:55:26.037 --> 02:55:28.619]  I mean, Mexico is imploding.
[02:55:28.619 --> 02:55:31.921]  Let's continue here with some more of your phone calls and I'll get into more news.
[02:55:31.921 --> 02:55:33.302]  Let's talk to Scott in Missouri.
[02:55:33.302 --> 02:55:35.804]  Scott, thanks for holding.
[02:55:35.804 --> 02:55:36.485]  Hello?
[02:55:36.485 --> 02:55:36.805]  Yes, sir.
[02:55:38.083 --> 02:55:39.203]  Hello, Alex.
[02:55:39.203 --> 02:55:40.264]  Thanks for keeping everything up.
[02:55:40.264 --> 02:55:41.664]  I've been fighting this for 25 years.
[02:55:41.664 --> 02:55:44.946]  I can't tell you what I've been through, but this is... I'm going to address your audience.
[02:55:44.946 --> 02:55:48.267]  People, get off your butts.
[02:55:48.267 --> 02:55:54.629]  You listen to this program every day, you hear the truth from Alex, and you don't do anything.
[02:55:54.629 --> 02:55:56.790]  Don't talk to your neighbors and drink beer.
[02:55:56.790 --> 02:56:00.071]  You might as well be listening to March Madness.
[02:56:00.071 --> 02:56:03.593]  All my friends that talk about this all the time, I say, hey, let's go hand out flyers.
[02:56:03.593 --> 02:56:05.594]  Let's print out DVDs.
[02:56:05.594 --> 02:56:06.654]  Let's have a movie showing.
[02:56:07.591 --> 02:56:09.872]  They're all too busy to do any of that.
[02:56:09.872 --> 02:56:15.676]  It's great that you know, but you're the sheep that know if you don't go out and do something.
[02:56:15.676 --> 02:56:16.636]  I can't stress that enough.
[02:56:16.636 --> 02:56:18.618]  I mean, I work on my website five hours a day.
[02:56:18.618 --> 02:56:27.303]  I've taken off of work permanently to work on this agenda, and listening isn't anything compared to doing something.
[02:56:30.043 --> 02:56:34.584]  Well, I agree with you, but remember, it's not going to be 50% that saves America.
[02:56:34.584 --> 02:56:36.184]  It's going to be the 3-percenters, like in 1776.
[02:56:36.184 --> 02:56:42.305]  We've got a lot more than 3% now out there becoming active, and that's what scares the system.
[02:56:42.305 --> 02:56:47.366]  That's why they're trying to demonize anybody and everybody who stands up for liberty and freedom.
[02:56:47.366 --> 02:56:48.286]  God bless you, Scott.
[02:56:48.286 --> 02:56:49.327]  Patrick.
[02:56:49.327 --> 02:56:51.667]  Patrick in Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[02:56:51.667 --> 02:56:53.688]  Oh, thank you for taking my call.
[02:56:53.688 --> 02:56:54.828]  Yeah, I have several points.
[02:56:54.828 --> 02:56:55.748]  I'll try to be quick, though.
[02:56:56.559 --> 02:57:12.293]  Everybody in Oklahoma, I just want to encourage you to vote for Randy Brogdon, and if you vote for him and if he wins, encourage him to take down all the real-time surveillance cameras all over Oklahoma City, and tell him to stop the sobriety checkpoints every weekend.
[02:57:12.293 --> 02:57:16.957]  The other thing I wanted to address was the property tax issue.
[02:57:16.957 --> 02:57:20.240]  I hear you talk about it, but not very many people talk about it.
[02:57:20.996 --> 02:57:31.749]  If we could get state after state to eliminate property taxes, that's one thing that, you know, even if you get off the grid and you grow your own food, you're still a slave because you're renting the property.
[02:57:34.059 --> 02:57:40.683]  I heard somebody in, I think it was Deborah Medina, mentioning it, and I was hoping she'd win, but she didn't, and I was hoping that she would.
[02:57:40.683 --> 02:57:49.428]  Maybe our governor would follow her, but if they would eliminate property taxes, then you could grow your own food, and if you didn't work somewhere else, then you wouldn't be paying property taxes.
[02:57:49.428 --> 02:57:53.530]  That's right, and we didn't have property taxes for the last 60, 70 years.
[02:57:53.530 --> 02:57:54.951]  This is a futile tax.
[02:57:54.951 --> 02:57:55.912]  In ancient Europe,
[02:57:57.421 --> 02:58:00.723]  You had to pay about 10% of everything you produced off your land.
[02:58:00.723 --> 02:58:02.204]  You were a serf.
[02:58:02.204 --> 02:58:03.385]  You were not a free man.
[02:58:03.385 --> 02:58:10.989]  A free man actually owned their land outright through some type of signet of the king or the local noble.
[02:58:10.989 --> 02:58:12.550]  And so we don't own our land.
[02:58:12.550 --> 02:58:14.632]  We rent our land.
[02:58:14.632 --> 02:58:20.615]  And now with all these environmental rules and the rest of it, they're trying to fully bankrupt people and take whatever sovereignty they've got.
[02:58:20.615 --> 02:58:21.816]  Excellent point.
[02:58:21.816 --> 02:58:23.597]  Get rid of property taxes.
[02:58:23.597 --> 02:58:24.258]  Think big.
[02:58:24.778 --> 02:58:27.300]  We built this country without it, without an income tax.
[02:58:27.300 --> 02:58:28.361]  We don't need it.
[02:58:28.361 --> 02:58:31.463]  There's lots of constitutional taxes.
[02:58:31.463 --> 02:58:37.408]  But they're not just expanding the unconstitutional taxes, they're bringing in all these new unconstitutional taxes.
[02:58:37.408 --> 02:58:40.670]  Final hour, jam-packed, straight ahead.
[02:58:40.670 --> 02:58:46.995]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.995 --> 02:58:49.057]  Visit GCNlive.com today.

[02:59:20.013 --> 02:59:27.561]  The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food, passing the savings to you in this buy three, get one free program.

[02:59:54.975 --> 02:59:57.377]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:57.377 --> 03:00:06.583]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:06.583 --> 03:00:08.164]  Okay, here's the deal.
[03:00:08.164 --> 03:00:22.834]  I'm going to Jason and Stacey and a few others and I'm leaving the phones wide open only for veterans who are receiving letters saying they've got to come in for testing or psychological testing or that they'll lose their funding.
[03:00:24.088 --> 03:00:25.068]  Some are getting these letters.
[03:00:25.068 --> 03:00:26.129]  We're getting a lot of reports of this.
[03:00:26.129 --> 03:00:27.949]  Others just say, you must come in.
[03:00:27.949 --> 03:00:28.689]  That's bad enough.
[03:00:28.689 --> 03:00:29.449]  1-800-259-9231.
[03:00:29.449 --> 03:00:29.590]  800-259-9231.
[03:00:29.590 --> 03:00:30.390]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:00:30.390 --> 03:00:33.311]  This is the last hour of this Ides of March.
[03:00:33.311 --> 03:00:33.631]  March 15, 2010.
[03:00:33.631 --> 03:00:33.871]  Audition.
[03:00:33.871 --> 03:00:36.351]  So thank you for joining us today.
[03:00:36.351 --> 03:00:39.692]  After I take a few more calls, I'm going to get into some very exciting news.
[03:00:39.692 --> 03:00:39.792]  Idaho
[03:00:54.731 --> 03:00:57.513]  is reporting out of the Idaho Reporter.
[03:00:57.513 --> 03:00:59.995]  Hurt wants to limit use of whole body scanners.
[03:00:59.995 --> 03:01:01.136]  He wants to ban them.
[03:01:01.136 --> 03:01:03.617]  Representative Phil Hurt, Republican of Hayden.
[03:01:03.617 --> 03:01:06.779]  We're going to get him on Idaho Legislature.
[03:01:06.779 --> 03:01:09.842]  And here's the bill.
[03:01:09.842 --> 03:01:13.964]  Also, we're going to get into $650 million payout.
[03:01:13.964 --> 03:01:17.167]  Proves government conspired to lie about 9-11.
[03:01:17.167 --> 03:01:19.468]  Key article.
[03:01:19.468 --> 03:01:20.289]  And then this biggin'.
[03:01:21.605 --> 03:01:22.145]  U.S.
[03:01:22.145 --> 03:01:22.566]  U.K.
[03:01:22.566 --> 03:01:24.367]  move closer to losing rating.
[03:01:24.367 --> 03:01:27.668]  Moody says, we will officially be a third world nation.
[03:01:27.668 --> 03:01:29.089]  All we have left is our dollar.
[03:01:29.089 --> 03:01:30.610]  It's already being devalued.
[03:01:30.610 --> 03:01:37.473]  And because the Federal Reserve is monetizing, buying its own, it pays itself to issue the money and the credit.
[03:01:37.473 --> 03:01:39.354]  It's just like a snake eating its tail.
[03:01:39.354 --> 03:01:42.076]  It's really eating us in the process.
[03:01:42.076 --> 03:01:43.336]  So this is out of Bloomberg.
[03:01:45.794 --> 03:01:46.755]  Absolutely amazing.
[03:01:46.755 --> 03:01:47.756]  It's also in Business Week.
[03:01:47.756 --> 03:01:49.578]  You can see that up on your screen.
[03:01:49.578 --> 03:01:51.901]  So, that is coming up.
[03:01:51.901 --> 03:01:57.107]  Also, Russian invasion scare sweeps Georgia after TV hoax.
[03:01:57.107 --> 03:01:59.530]  Well, the thing on 888 was a hoax.
[03:01:59.530 --> 03:02:01.913]  So, we're going to talk about that.
[03:02:04.591 --> 03:02:06.792]  Coming up as well.
[03:02:06.792 --> 03:02:13.395]  And I want to get back into the fluoride situation that I started covering yesterday before this hour ends.
[03:02:13.395 --> 03:02:17.837]  So a key fourth hour that you're tuned into right now.
[03:02:17.837 --> 03:02:20.098]  But let's go ahead now and go to Jason in Florida.
[03:02:20.098 --> 03:02:21.859]  Jason, you're on the air.
[03:02:21.859 --> 03:02:23.180]  Hey Alex.
[03:02:23.180 --> 03:02:23.540]  Hello.
[03:02:23.540 --> 03:02:27.041]  And I just want to say that I really admire you.
[03:02:27.041 --> 03:02:30.343]  Your last guest that you had on
[03:02:31.568 --> 03:02:35.311]  She, I assume, is like you, has so much common sense.
[03:02:35.311 --> 03:02:38.073]  I wish people had common sense.
[03:02:38.073 --> 03:02:40.595]  You know, just use your head.
[03:02:40.595 --> 03:02:45.678]  You could figure stuff out so easily just by using your head.
[03:02:45.678 --> 03:02:47.359]  Oh, but that's a conspiracy theory.
[03:02:47.359 --> 03:02:57.807]  If you don't like banks raping you, or you don't like body scanning cameras run by people arrested for child rape, Boston Herald today, you must be bad.
[03:02:57.807 --> 03:03:00.829]  Oh, and I want to say, I thank you so much for earlier
[03:03:01.420 --> 03:03:11.523]  Repeating what John Walsh said about the pedophiles and people that are registered because Here in Florida, I live where Cargill is.
[03:03:11.523 --> 03:03:24.147]  Just north, I live in Lakeland, Florida, north of Mulberry, where the pits are, the mines, that Austin buys all their crap to put in the water.
[03:03:24.147 --> 03:03:29.349]  And, um, yeah, in the Sheriff's Department here, you might have seen us on the
[03:03:30.307 --> 03:03:45.014]  Mainstream media, when these guys went to raid some guy's home looking for drugs, and spent nine hours playing Wii on his TV, and they were busted because the computer recorded them all doing it.
[03:03:45.014 --> 03:03:46.415]  Remember that?
[03:03:46.415 --> 03:03:48.516]  No, I didn't hear about that.
[03:03:48.516 --> 03:03:49.157]  Oh yeah?
[03:03:49.157 --> 03:03:50.357]  What was the headline on that?
[03:03:50.357 --> 03:03:53.599]  Police caught playing Wii in suspect's home?
[03:03:53.599 --> 03:03:54.559]  Yep.
[03:03:54.559 --> 03:03:57.601]  But during that raid, nine hours they did this.
[03:03:58.095 --> 03:04:03.403]  And all the cops got for it was just a, you know, oh, you need to go and have training done again.
[03:04:03.403 --> 03:04:06.047]  Yeah, there it is.
[03:04:06.047 --> 03:04:11.155]  Florida police caught playing Wii after raid for nine hours.
[03:04:11.155 --> 03:04:13.398]  I mean, what a bunch of lazy thugs, man.
[03:04:14.429 --> 03:04:15.370]  Oh, it makes me sick.
[03:04:15.370 --> 03:04:16.731]  I appreciate your call.
[03:04:16.731 --> 03:04:21.215]  By the way, I mentioned this yesterday, but Jaren just brought it in again, because it is a big deal.
[03:04:21.215 --> 03:04:22.736]  Thanks for reminding me.
[03:04:22.736 --> 03:04:24.738]  AP exclusive!
[03:04:24.738 --> 03:04:30.423]  Pentagon gun was from Tennessee police, and Kurt Nimmo wrote a blurb on this.
[03:04:30.423 --> 03:04:33.606]  So was the gun used in the courthouse killing.
[03:04:33.606 --> 03:04:34.947]  Shooting.
[03:04:34.947 --> 03:04:38.350]  The police confiscate your guns and then give them to the killers.
[03:04:38.350 --> 03:04:39.711]  Definitely a stage government op.
[03:04:42.810 --> 03:04:44.772]  And I like Peter Graves.
[03:04:44.772 --> 03:04:45.794]  He died yesterday.
[03:04:45.794 --> 03:04:46.815]  A couple days ago.
[03:04:46.815 --> 03:04:47.656]  Too bad that happened.
[03:04:47.656 --> 03:04:49.558]  I like him.
[03:04:49.558 --> 03:04:55.706]  Mission Impossible.
[03:04:55.706 --> 03:04:58.670]  This is not Mission Impossible to defeat the New World Order.
[03:04:58.670 --> 03:04:59.671]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:59.671 --> 03:05:00.131]  Stay with us.
[03:05:01.312 --> 03:05:06.639]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[03:05:06.639 --> 03:05:09.403]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[03:05:09.403 --> 03:05:13.769]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[03:05:16.152 --> 03:05:19.193]  Order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.

[03:06:01.107 --> 03:06:05.649]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:06:05.649 --> 03:06:06.549]  Number one.
[03:06:06.549 --> 03:06:09.990]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:06:09.990 --> 03:06:10.830]  Number two.
[03:06:10.830 --> 03:06:15.732]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:06:15.732 --> 03:06:16.472]  It's true.
[03:06:16.472 --> 03:06:21.014]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:06:21.334 --> 03:06:22.175]  Number 3.
[03:06:22.175 --> 03:06:25.760]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:06:25.760 --> 03:06:29.664]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:06:29.664 --> 03:06:30.465]  Number 4.
[03:06:30.465 --> 03:06:33.229]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:06:33.229 --> 03:06:36.913]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:06:36.913 --> 03:06:37.154]  Number 5.
[03:06:37.694 --> 03:06:41.838]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:06:41.838 --> 03:06:46.903]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:06:46.903 --> 03:06:51.067]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:06:51.067 --> 03:06:52.869]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:06:52.869 --> 03:06:57.474]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[03:07:02.523 --> 03:07:05.552]  Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get food.
[03:07:05.552 --> 03:07:08.982]  Well, here's an unbelievable chance for you to jumpstart your food
[03:07:09.889 --> 03:07:10.569]  We're good to go!
[03:07:39.239 --> 03:07:42.521]  Folks, this is the best chance to stock up you'll ever see.
[03:07:42.521 --> 03:07:43.502]  Another example?
[03:07:43.502 --> 03:07:46.684]  Buy nine months worth of food and get three months free.
[03:07:46.684 --> 03:07:51.848]  You've got to go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex for the food buy of a lifetime.
[03:07:51.848 --> 03:07:52.568]  Or call 800-409-5633.
[03:07:52.568 --> 03:07:53.629]  Go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex or 800-409-5633.
[03:08:03.101 --> 03:08:05.870]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:05.870 --> 03:08:08.699]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:11.275 --> 03:08:23.344]  Okay, now the phones are only open for veterans that are receiving these letters saying they've got to show up for psychological or other evaluation or they'll lose their funding, which cannot be revoked by law.
[03:08:23.344 --> 03:08:26.686]  You know, Obama last year, we had to have the Veterans of Foreign Wars on.
[03:08:26.686 --> 03:08:28.567]  It was in Reuters.
[03:08:28.567 --> 03:08:31.489]  Obama wanted to make veterans buy their own insurance.
[03:08:31.489 --> 03:08:34.792]  Yeah, let's give all the illegal aliens health care, but not veterans.
[03:08:34.792 --> 03:08:35.352]  I mean, you know.
[03:08:36.061 --> 03:08:40.303]  And the bigger issue here is police and current veterans.
[03:08:40.303 --> 03:08:41.823]  You will be thrown under the bus.
[03:08:41.823 --> 03:08:43.024]  The globalists hate you.
[03:08:43.024 --> 03:08:44.605]  You know how to use a gun.
[03:08:44.605 --> 03:08:46.345]  You know how to carry out authority.
[03:08:46.345 --> 03:08:47.826]  You've been taught initiative.
[03:08:47.826 --> 03:08:49.547]  You've been taught assertiveness.
[03:08:49.547 --> 03:08:54.028]  You have built up not just courage, there's something even better than courage.
[03:08:54.028 --> 03:08:55.109]  You just get to where you don't care.
[03:08:56.269 --> 03:09:04.495]  I'm not claiming I'm a veteran, I've never been in the military, but I've had death threats, I've been physically attacked, I've been through a lot of stress, and you just get to a point where you really don't even care.
[03:09:04.495 --> 03:09:07.417]  In fact, you actually lose energy until you're being attacked.
[03:09:07.417 --> 03:09:16.723]  I'm sure a lot of people that have been under stress know this, and I have nothing compared to these veterans and police who've got really tough jobs, and a lot of great men and women.
[03:09:19.343 --> 03:09:20.803]  They're scared to death of you.
[03:09:20.803 --> 03:09:26.584]  Cops, when you're done, and when you spend your 30 years on the force, they're going to come after you, too.
[03:09:26.584 --> 03:09:27.825]  They already are.
[03:09:27.825 --> 03:09:30.225]  And you need to figure this out and get it through your brain.
[03:09:30.225 --> 03:09:31.946]  You're with us, the American people.
[03:09:31.946 --> 03:09:33.486]  Jaren, come on in.
[03:09:33.486 --> 03:09:34.166]  Thanks.
[03:09:34.166 --> 03:09:36.446]  More documents.
[03:09:36.446 --> 03:09:37.847]  Okay.
[03:09:37.847 --> 03:09:39.967]  Stacey was before the veterans started calling.
[03:09:39.967 --> 03:09:41.447]  We're going to Pastor and others.
[03:09:41.447 --> 03:09:43.688]  The caller's going by.
[03:09:43.688 --> 03:09:44.748]  Stacey in Washington.
[03:09:44.748 --> 03:09:46.188]  Go ahead.
[03:09:46.188 --> 03:09:46.849]  Hey, Alex.
[03:09:46.849 --> 03:09:48.189]  How you doing?
[03:09:48.189 --> 03:09:48.489]  Good.
[03:09:48.489 --> 03:09:49.089]  I'm doing all right.
[03:09:50.325 --> 03:09:54.648]  Hey, I'm just letting you know I joined the Info Warrior Mass with you.
[03:09:54.648 --> 03:09:57.690]  I got you broadcasting here in Spokane, Washington.
[03:09:57.690 --> 03:09:59.251]  So, but that's not my question.
[03:09:59.251 --> 03:10:07.757]  My question was, what do you know about Eastern Washington State University's involvement in the Global Geoengineering Project here?
[03:10:08.539 --> 03:10:09.540]  I know quite a bit about it.
[03:10:09.540 --> 03:10:13.963]  We've gone out and interviewed Skywatch, California, the founders of it.
[03:10:13.963 --> 03:10:22.048]  They've been to all these government meetings, all these documents, We Are Change LA, went to one of the meetings, and about four years ago, a caller called in.
[03:10:22.048 --> 03:10:23.369]  Again, I don't know everything.
[03:10:23.369 --> 03:10:24.890]  If there's a lot, I don't know.
[03:10:24.890 --> 03:10:28.953]  I'm just somebody that focuses on this all the time, and so I know more than most.
[03:10:28.953 --> 03:10:32.855]  I mean, if you did it as much as I did, most of you would be better at this than I am.
[03:10:32.855 --> 03:10:36.018]  And the caller called in, and what was the term he used?
[03:10:39.349 --> 03:10:42.235]  Call Watson, ask him the aerosol campaign name.
[03:10:42.235 --> 03:10:44.900]  Watson, the brain, will always know these things.
[03:10:44.900 --> 03:10:47.966]  I'm kind of tired, only got 3-4 hours sleep last night.
[03:10:47.966 --> 03:10:49.189]  The caller called in and he said...
[03:10:50.407 --> 03:11:01.413]  Passive aerosol spray campaign, I believe is the term, and literally hundreds of thousands of links, mainly universities and government, they call it testing.
[03:11:01.413 --> 03:11:09.838]  And thousands of aircraft missions, they mention, where they're spraying particulates out that then form nuclei that form clouds.
[03:11:10.762 --> 03:11:13.183]  Well, they spray nuclei out that form clouds.
[03:11:13.183 --> 03:11:21.748]  And then White House Science Czar came out last year in his first speech, it's AP video, and said, we need to terraform, geoengineer the planet.
[03:11:21.748 --> 03:11:25.410]  And that university you mentioned is one of the main ones, Stanford's involved.
[03:11:25.410 --> 03:11:28.832]  I mean, literally, Department of Energy, other governments.
[03:11:28.832 --> 03:11:34.035]  And I was out back with the kids playing football this weekend.
[03:11:34.035 --> 03:11:38.177]  And I sat back in a lawn chair with my wife, we're drinking lemonade.
[03:11:39.147 --> 03:11:45.671]  And I looked up at like 35,000 feet and saw jets going over and the trails were disappearing within 30 seconds.
[03:11:45.671 --> 03:11:49.474]  And I was like, wow, a good old-fashioned condensation trail.
[03:11:49.474 --> 03:11:53.517]  Remember when you were a kid, it was kind of neat to see them because you didn't see them that often.
[03:11:53.517 --> 03:11:59.281]  And at sunset, you'd see them and you'd see these orange streaks in the night sky up where the sunlight was still coming over the earth.
[03:12:00.308 --> 03:12:10.777]  And sometimes, depending on the tilt of the earth, it can even be dark outside, but still up at, say, 50,000 feet, the sun's light was coming over and you'd see these beautiful condensation trails.
[03:12:10.777 --> 03:12:13.560]  Now, starting at about 96, trails at 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000 feet in the summer.
[03:12:17.583 --> 03:12:21.166]  When at 5,000 feet, you know, it's 80 degrees, 75 degrees.
[03:12:21.166 --> 03:12:22.807]  There's no ice crystals up there.
[03:12:22.807 --> 03:12:29.272]  And it stays there for an hour and dissipates and, I mean, doesn't dissipate and then turns into these big cloud banks.
[03:12:29.272 --> 03:12:32.154]  And then we get the government documents.
[03:12:32.154 --> 03:12:37.358]  Forget the scientist's name, he got a Nobel Prize in 92 for the geoengineering plan.
[03:12:37.358 --> 03:12:41.161]  How to put the particulates out from jets.
[03:12:41.161 --> 03:12:44.584]  How to compartmentalize it where the jet pilots don't even know it's going on.
[03:12:44.584 --> 03:12:46.946]  And how to manipulate the weather.
[03:12:48.144 --> 03:12:56.510]  And so they just, and it turns out that in 95 is when the major testing, you know, they call it testing.
[03:12:56.510 --> 03:12:58.712]  And now Obama says we're going to go full bore with this.
[03:12:58.712 --> 03:13:00.493]  I can't imagine what full bore.
[03:13:00.493 --> 03:13:01.894]  In fact, put that article back up, please.
[03:13:01.894 --> 03:13:03.135]  You just found a great article.
[03:13:03.135 --> 03:13:05.377]  That's Infowars.net article.
[03:13:05.377 --> 03:13:09.500]  Obama's plan to geoengineer the planet mirrors CFR policy documents.
[03:13:09.500 --> 03:13:10.441]  Yeah, the CFR!
[03:13:11.505 --> 03:13:13.107]  In the 90s said Geoengineer.
[03:13:13.107 --> 03:13:14.308]  They had another one in May of 2008.
[03:13:14.308 --> 03:13:17.071]  And don't believe Infowars.net.
[03:13:17.071 --> 03:13:19.973]  Second paragraph, link to the AP.
[03:13:19.973 --> 03:13:24.738]  Fourth paragraph, or fifth paragraph, link to the CFR.
[03:13:24.738 --> 03:13:26.980]  In fact, let's on screen for people.
[03:13:26.980 --> 03:13:28.982]  Let's click the CFR document.
[03:13:28.982 --> 03:13:33.126]  Let's go to the CFR that basically writes our laws.
[03:13:33.126 --> 03:13:35.809]  And let's click on this live on TV for people.
[03:13:36.654 --> 03:13:38.536]  Oh, see, here's Chemtrails.
[03:13:38.536 --> 03:13:40.798]  Loading, loading, loading.
[03:13:40.798 --> 03:13:43.700]  And, uh, CFR site's loading.
[03:13:43.700 --> 03:13:44.881]  There it is!
[03:13:44.881 --> 03:13:45.381]  Oh!
[03:13:45.381 --> 03:13:52.707]  Council on Foreign Relations Geoengineering Workshop on Unilateral Planetary Scale Geoengineering.
[03:13:52.707 --> 03:13:53.088]  Oh!
[03:13:53.088 --> 03:13:54.609]  But I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[03:13:57.239 --> 03:13:59.141]  I don't know, that just hits home.
[03:13:59.141 --> 03:14:04.426]  It's right down the road from us here in Spokane, so I thought I'd let some people around my area know about that.
[03:14:21.294 --> 03:14:22.315]  Well, thank you, Stacey.
[03:14:22.315 --> 03:14:23.176]  Don't feel bad.
[03:14:23.176 --> 03:14:32.684]  Every major university, randomly look up the name of your university, if it's a major school, not just a community college, and type in geoengineering.
[03:14:32.684 --> 03:14:34.886]  Did Watson say that key search term?
[03:14:34.886 --> 03:14:39.089]  Something about aerosols, passive aerosol spraying campaign?
[03:14:39.089 --> 03:14:40.471]  I think that's the term.
[03:14:40.471 --> 03:14:41.992]  But I don't want to give it out wrong.
[03:14:41.992 --> 03:14:48.658]  Passive, what's the key, the caller four years ago that changed everything?
[03:14:48.658 --> 03:14:48.878]  Again.
[03:14:50.270 --> 03:14:59.420]  This had been hidden in view for 10 years on the internet, totally admitted, and I didn't know it was admitted.
[03:14:59.420 --> 03:14:59.920]  Until you...
[03:15:01.377 --> 03:15:03.178]  Figured it out and called me.
[03:15:03.178 --> 03:15:07.079]  And then we put it out to this big audience, and now, why should they hide it?
[03:15:07.079 --> 03:15:09.840]  They just come out and go, yeah, we're chemtrailing you.
[03:15:09.840 --> 03:15:12.261]  Barium salts, aluminum dioxide.
[03:15:12.261 --> 03:15:13.662]  Massive brain damage.
[03:15:13.662 --> 03:15:17.964]  Oh, you won't drink your fluoride, also filled with mercury and aluminum.
[03:15:17.964 --> 03:15:22.206]  Oh, oh, well, we're just gonna spray it on you.
[03:15:22.206 --> 03:15:26.387]  I mean, how stupid, why aren't all the cops on our side right now?
[03:15:26.387 --> 03:15:27.808]  You're being sprayed too, buddy!
[03:15:30.916 --> 03:15:33.098]  I don't want to be enemy with the government people.
[03:15:33.098 --> 03:15:44.690]  Because I know they're just like me, they're just like you, they're just people, they're compartmentalized, they're brainwashed, they're dumbed down just like I was 14, 15 years ago.
[03:15:44.690 --> 03:15:47.252]  I'm ranting and I said I've got so much news to get to.
[03:15:47.252 --> 03:15:49.735]  Alright, we've got a couple vets that have called in.
[03:15:49.735 --> 03:15:51.617]  Pastor in Ohio, did you get the letter?
[03:15:52.694 --> 03:16:19.356]  Yeah, I got a, Alex I called you before and I got this letter from the VA and what it did was is they literally changed my scheduled appointment and when I got in there I, they went ahead and did a regular scheduled appointment but then I was talking to the uh, after I got through they wanted me to come down to see the DAV and I asked what for and they said well they just wanted to talk with me.
[03:16:19.356 --> 03:16:20.437]  Well when I went there
[03:16:21.483 --> 03:16:31.585]  I went in there and they were asking me, they said they just had a few questions to ask if I had bad dreams or if I got emotional watching movies and things like that.
[03:16:31.585 --> 03:16:37.427]  I started asking all these questions and asked if I ever had a psych exam and I said no.
[03:16:37.427 --> 03:16:41.748]  Well, the phone rang and they asked me if I could step out of the office because this was an important call.
[03:16:41.748 --> 03:16:46.729]  Well, I called my wife on my cell phone to let her know what was going on.
[03:16:48.911 --> 03:16:50.592]  She just got off the phone.
[03:16:50.592 --> 03:16:53.093]  She just got off the phone with them.
[03:16:53.093 --> 03:17:00.716]  Here they called my house and was asking my wife the exact same questions that they were asking me.
[03:17:00.716 --> 03:17:07.158]  Yeah, well that's because you're the pastor that gave us some of the FEMA documents and you're being targeted.
[03:17:07.158 --> 03:17:10.260]  But let's expand on this.
[03:17:10.260 --> 03:17:17.823]  All three times I went in to have children with my wife at the hospital, we figured it out the first time, they said, will you run this file downstairs for me?
[03:17:19.242 --> 03:17:19.745]  I leave.
[03:17:19.745 --> 03:17:21.958]  I come back five minutes later.
[03:17:23.024 --> 03:17:27.306]  And my wife says, that lady was asking me, first, do we have enough money?
[03:17:27.306 --> 03:17:29.486]  Am I mean to you?
[03:17:29.486 --> 03:17:33.388]  I think they asked her the same thing, do you have bad dreams?
[03:17:33.388 --> 03:17:38.790]  And then later I figured it out and confronted them by the second time, and it's for the CPS.
[03:17:38.790 --> 03:17:40.350]  They don't tell you they're basically a cop.
[03:17:40.350 --> 03:17:41.811]  They don't tell you you're being interrogated.
[03:17:41.811 --> 03:17:43.331]  There's no Miranda rights.
[03:17:43.331 --> 03:17:44.432]  It's totally illegal.
[03:17:44.432 --> 03:17:48.853]  But the health department orders the hospital to do this via color of law.
[03:17:48.853 --> 03:17:50.034]  And it's put in a computer database.
[03:17:51.636 --> 03:17:54.398]  Going back to the New Freedom Initiative, the internal documents came out in 2005.
[03:17:54.398 --> 03:17:57.580]  This was in the major Pennsylvania papers.
[03:17:57.580 --> 03:18:00.603]  That's where one of their board members blew the whistle.
[03:18:00.603 --> 03:18:08.728]  The internal minutes that they plan to put half of American school children on psychotropics and anti-psychotics, Prozac, lithium, things like that.
[03:18:08.728 --> 03:18:17.795]  And how they did it is that they've written the New Freedom where all boys and girls in elementary and middle school, and then high school, and 13, 14 year olds always are having problems.
[03:18:17.795 --> 03:18:20.377]  Your hormones, you're changing, you're having, you know, it's normal.
[03:18:21.394 --> 03:18:31.522]  This is the time in anthropology and sociology and psychology for you to leave the home in the primitive situation and go start your own hut at about 13, 14, 15.
[03:18:31.522 --> 03:18:35.505]  So there's a natural thing to get the kids out of the house so you start fighting with each other.
[03:18:35.505 --> 03:18:39.589]  But the point is, they say, are you having bad dreams?
[03:18:39.589 --> 03:18:41.650]  Everyone has bad dreams.
[03:18:41.650 --> 03:18:42.911]  I mean, I usually have good dreams.
[03:18:42.911 --> 03:18:48.316]  I had one hell of a nightmare about a week ago.
[03:18:48.316 --> 03:18:50.578]  But see, that's mentally ill.
[03:18:51.772 --> 03:18:54.633]  I mean, that's bad!
[03:18:54.633 --> 03:19:07.456]  So, they call you in, they ask you if you're having bad dreams, psychological problems, they want to take your Second Amendment with no law, then they say, we need to make a phone call, they call your wife, you have a bad feeling and call her, and they say, they just called me, what else happened?
[03:19:07.456 --> 03:19:19.740]  Well, she told me all the questions that they asked her, and which was some of the ones that they even asked me, and my wife said, well, my husband's up there, why don't you just ask him?
[03:19:26.465 --> 03:19:28.827]  The government lies as a matter of course.
[03:19:28.827 --> 03:19:30.248]  It's a criminal group.
[03:19:30.248 --> 03:19:30.968]  So how did this end?
[03:19:30.968 --> 03:19:32.810]  Did you march in and confront them?
[03:19:32.810 --> 03:19:39.776]  Oh, and I bet getting angry at their lies and secret police activity, treating a veteran like a criminal,
[03:19:41.081 --> 03:19:44.843]  And creating definitions of mental illness so wide we're all mentally ill.
[03:19:44.843 --> 03:19:46.744]  I bet that was the mental illness too.
[03:19:46.744 --> 03:19:49.205]  Oh, you got angry at us snooping around and lying.
[03:19:49.205 --> 03:19:50.365]  Stay there, Pastor.
[03:19:50.365 --> 03:19:54.748]  Then we're gonna go to Rob, Bob, Raul, and others.
[03:19:54.748 --> 03:19:58.009]  And then that's gonna be it with the vets because I need to get to all this news.
[03:19:58.009 --> 03:19:59.250]  Believe me, it's jam-packed.
[03:19:59.250 --> 03:20:00.350]  It's all coming up.
[03:20:00.350 --> 03:20:04.752]  Saving the most important for last.
[03:20:04.752 --> 03:20:10.395]  As the economy continues to decline, patriots across the nation are preparing for the worst.
[03:20:11.058 --> 03:20:13.260]  The world is changing fast.
[03:20:13.260 --> 03:20:15.501]  Are you fully prepared?
[03:20:15.501 --> 03:20:18.704]  Or will you be forced to eat government soup?

[03:21:05.313 --> 03:21:07.614]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?

[03:22:21.185 --> 03:22:26.727]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:22:26.727 --> 03:22:36.351]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:22:36.491 --> 03:22:38.833]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:22:38.833 --> 03:22:40.413]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:22:40.413 --> 03:22:42.875]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:22:42.875 --> 03:22:44.996]  Today seems like nobody does care.

[03:24:12.755 --> 03:24:16.157]  Material safety data sheet, calcium fluoride.
[03:24:16.157 --> 03:24:19.059]  That's supposedly the good kind they put in the water.
[03:24:19.059 --> 03:24:21.460]  How dangerous and deadly it is.
[03:24:21.460 --> 03:24:22.720]  Make your organs fail.
[03:24:22.720 --> 03:24:28.363]  This is just the safety shipping info for it.
[03:24:28.363 --> 03:24:31.505]  Alright, going back to Pastor in Ohio, and I can vouch for Pastor.
[03:24:34.362 --> 03:24:40.946]  Well, they denied that it even happened and she stated that it wasn't even her that made the call and so I have some people that I know that are higher up that I went to at the VA office
[03:24:57.134 --> 03:25:08.102]  And I come to find out that the big push for all this is they're trying to get as many Vietnam vets classified to where they can have their psych exams.
[03:25:08.102 --> 03:25:15.688]  Because once you have a psych exam, you not only cannot buy a gun, but you cannot get a concealed carry license.
[03:25:15.688 --> 03:25:21.632]  And also, it was stated that the big reason for this whole push is because
[03:25:22.352 --> 03:25:32.640]  The Vietnam veterans were the last veterans that could actually do everything that the veterans are doing today as far as forward observers and all the other stuff.
[03:25:32.640 --> 03:25:40.526]  We could actually do it without having something that used a battery in order to come up with the calculations.
[03:25:40.526 --> 03:25:49.573]  And they know that the Vietnam vets could actually train, one Vietnam vet they said, if he trained ten persons, that is a lot of
[03:25:50.171 --> 03:25:54.635]  People learning a lot of information that they would not have otherwise found out.
[03:25:54.635 --> 03:26:01.020]  But they're using the DAV and the VFW to get the names of people also.
[03:26:01.020 --> 03:26:01.840]  Well, let me stop you.
[03:26:01.840 --> 03:26:08.606]  You saw the New York Times, it's in Fall of the Republic, how they're training the Boy Scouts to quote, take on disgruntled vets.
[03:26:08.606 --> 03:26:10.768]  I mean, you can't make up this magnitude of evil.
[03:26:11.727 --> 03:26:13.448]  And it's so illegal.
[03:26:13.448 --> 03:26:19.210]  There's no law that they just make up a psychological designation, you can't have a gun, but they control the incident check.
[03:26:19.210 --> 03:26:22.271]  By the way, we told you Arte Cerveda is probably going to go to Dallas.
[03:26:22.271 --> 03:26:27.733]  The Austin police chief, who's basically a fed, who started warrantless blood taking.
[03:26:27.733 --> 03:26:32.135]  Now, here is the Dallas Morning News today.
[03:26:32.135 --> 03:26:36.596]  Dallas police seek blood tests for all DUI suspects.
[03:26:36.596 --> 03:26:39.177]  No judge, no jury, no warrant.
[03:26:39.177 --> 03:26:40.638]  Everyone will have their blood taken.
[03:26:41.448 --> 03:26:44.891]  You won't be marched out to see if you can stand on one leg.
[03:26:44.891 --> 03:26:47.213]  You won't have to sit there and follow the light and touch your nose.
[03:26:47.213 --> 03:26:49.014]  I've had them do it to me.
[03:26:49.014 --> 03:26:50.255]  I'm like, no, I'm not drinking.
[03:26:50.255 --> 03:26:53.037]  No, I really was working at two o'clock in the morning.
[03:26:53.037 --> 03:26:54.799]  Get out of the car.
[03:26:54.799 --> 03:26:58.242]  And I could have refused it, but I said, this guy's gonna arrest me if I refuse.
[03:26:58.242 --> 03:26:59.723]  I did it, and I did it all perfectly.
[03:26:59.723 --> 03:27:00.643]  I said, see?
[03:27:00.643 --> 03:27:03.166]  And he goes, are you on PCP, cocaine, or other drugs?
[03:27:03.166 --> 03:27:05.027]  And I said, PCP?
[03:27:05.027 --> 03:27:07.869]  Number one, I don't do drugs, and I know no one who's ever seen PCP.
[03:27:07.869 --> 03:27:09.631]  And he started laughing along with me.
[03:27:12.552 --> 03:27:14.433]  Some of us do work till two o'clock in the morning.
[03:27:14.433 --> 03:27:16.295]  We don't need to just be pulled over.
[03:27:16.295 --> 03:27:22.079]  I was driving completely straight, going home, side issue.
[03:27:22.079 --> 03:27:25.021]  Now they're going to take your blood to get a driver's license.
[03:27:25.021 --> 03:27:28.884]  That's already on the books as an executive order.
[03:27:28.884 --> 03:27:31.425]  Raul in Florida, a vet, then Bob.
[03:27:31.425 --> 03:27:33.387]  Did this happen to you, Raul?
[03:27:33.387 --> 03:27:34.588]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[03:27:34.588 --> 03:27:34.888]  Good, sir.
[03:27:36.640 --> 03:27:40.162]  I heard the caller calling about the letter to the veterans.
[03:27:40.162 --> 03:27:44.143]  Well, they're also doing it without notifying veterans, because I was one of those.
[03:27:44.143 --> 03:27:54.567]  I'm already getting service-connected for PTSD, and on a visit with my psychiatrist, they said, oh, you're scheduled for another competent for PTSD.
[03:27:54.567 --> 03:27:55.307]  And I said, really?
[03:27:55.307 --> 03:27:57.388]  She was like, well, that's really supposed to go through me.
[03:27:58.177 --> 03:28:00.178]  And she goes, they just scheduled you for it.
[03:28:00.178 --> 03:28:05.261]  And now notice they've started all these PSAs about our veterans are having problems.
[03:28:05.261 --> 03:28:09.483]  See, they're starting the demonization of the veterans in PSAs.
[03:28:09.483 --> 03:28:10.243]  Exactly.
[03:28:10.243 --> 03:28:24.911]  And then in Florida, I know there's another letter circulating on that they have, um, the letter I received was, um, notified me personally, identifiable information, including your name and social security number were improperly disclosed.
[03:28:26.235 --> 03:28:35.576]  And on the letterhead is the Department of Veteran Affairs and they have a promotion code to go to Equifax and get their credit monitoring for free.
[03:28:37.839 --> 03:28:41.381]  Yeah, they want to track everything you're buying.
[03:28:41.381 --> 03:28:43.782]  That's what all this identity theft protection is.
[03:28:43.782 --> 03:28:47.824]  Meanwhile, the banks, 600,000 names, a million names, five million names.
[03:28:47.824 --> 03:28:49.445]  Every week, I saw one yesterday.
[03:28:49.445 --> 03:28:51.266]  In fact, where is that article?
[03:28:51.266 --> 03:28:56.188]  600,000 social security numbers given out by a major bank.
[03:28:56.188 --> 03:28:57.789]  That's where it's all happening.
[03:28:57.789 --> 03:29:02.011]  And it's happening at gas stations where they scan your card and then they
[03:29:02.831 --> 03:29:06.134]  Fax the number to their brother in India or Russia, mainly.
[03:29:06.134 --> 03:29:09.937]  In Pakistan it happens a lot, and that's where they're ripping you off.
[03:29:09.937 --> 03:29:14.440]  But the media won't tell you how the real rip-offs are happening.
[03:29:14.440 --> 03:29:17.062]  They tell you, oh, you need to have fraud monitoring.
[03:29:17.062 --> 03:29:21.326]  Citibank exposes 600,000 customers' social security numbers.
[03:29:21.326 --> 03:29:23.688]  There it is, Chicago Tribune, Friday.
[03:29:23.688 --> 03:29:25.049]  So how did this end, Darul?
[03:29:26.139 --> 03:29:34.863]  Well, I ended up going to the appointment and he basically just talked in anecdotal stories and it was basically a waste of time.
[03:29:34.863 --> 03:29:36.343]  And you know, you get the basic questions.
[03:29:36.343 --> 03:29:37.364]  Are you going to kill anybody?
[03:29:37.364 --> 03:29:39.544]  Are you going to hurt yourself?
[03:29:39.544 --> 03:29:41.465]  And it was a basic waste of time.
[03:29:41.465 --> 03:29:45.427]  And then he put a whole bunch of stuff in his computer that I couldn't see and then I was done.
[03:29:45.427 --> 03:29:48.188]  But he typed longer than he talked to me.
[03:29:48.188 --> 03:29:49.829]  And see, he's the new judge.
[03:29:49.829 --> 03:29:51.369]  He decides if you can own a gun.
[03:29:51.369 --> 03:29:52.690]  Because you're an evil veteran.
[03:29:52.690 --> 03:29:53.970]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.970 --> 03:29:55.471]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:56.488 --> 03:30:01.573]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.573 --> 03:30:02.714]  What's your home worth?
[03:30:02.714 --> 03:30:04.836]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[03:30:04.836 --> 03:30:07.879]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?

[03:31:03.422 --> 03:31:07.444]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:31:07.444 --> 03:31:10.685]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:31:10.685 --> 03:31:12.106]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:31:12.805 --> 03:31:15.488]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:31:15.488 --> 03:31:21.894]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:31:21.894 --> 03:31:27.079]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:31:27.079 --> 03:31:37.068]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:31:37.168 --> 03:31:39.530]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:31:39.530 --> 03:31:41.111]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:31:41.111 --> 03:31:43.572]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:31:43.572 --> 03:31:45.694]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:31:45.694 --> 03:31:50.837]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:31:50.837 --> 03:31:59.963]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[03:33:34.924 --> 03:33:37.586]  Okay, I'm going to take one more call from a vet.
[03:33:37.586 --> 03:33:42.930]  And if you just joined us, Clinton started this covertly.
[03:33:42.930 --> 03:33:46.652]  They're now openly saying no judge, no jury, no law.
[03:33:46.652 --> 03:33:56.219]  They just have VA hospital psychologists, psychiatrists, and other employees just say you're mentally ill.
[03:33:56.219 --> 03:34:00.182]  If you go in and say I have nightmares sometimes, that's it.
[03:34:00.182 --> 03:34:01.303]  No more Second Amendment for you.
[03:34:02.312 --> 03:34:03.313]  And they don't even tell you that.
[03:34:03.313 --> 03:34:05.874]  They just put it in the computer and it's done.
[03:34:05.874 --> 03:34:08.956]  When you go in to have a baby, they say, do you have plenty of money?
[03:34:08.956 --> 03:34:10.617]  Do you guys argue and fight?
[03:34:10.617 --> 03:34:12.298]  They'll get the man out of the room.
[03:34:12.298 --> 03:34:13.899]  It all goes to the health department.
[03:34:13.899 --> 03:34:19.242]  You're not being told that you're basically in a law enforcement setting outside of any law.
[03:34:19.242 --> 03:34:21.043]  This is the essence of a police state.
[03:34:22.332 --> 03:34:25.953]  And they hate veteran police, they hate veteran military.
[03:34:25.953 --> 03:34:27.654]  Why do you serve this new world order?
[03:34:27.654 --> 03:34:28.494]  Why do you love it?
[03:34:28.494 --> 03:34:30.974]  Why do you go along with the petty power you're given?
[03:34:30.974 --> 03:34:35.536]  Because after you're not their servant anymore, you are their number one target.
[03:34:35.536 --> 03:34:38.317]  And it was the same in Nazi Germany and Communist Russia.
[03:34:38.317 --> 03:34:42.518]  They always go after the retirees who've worked in the system.
[03:34:42.518 --> 03:34:46.719]  And as the police state gets worse, that's correspondingly going to get worse.
[03:34:48.760 --> 03:34:50.081]  America is a police state.
[03:34:50.081 --> 03:34:52.282]  I mean, look at these headlines I've got right here.
[03:34:52.282 --> 03:34:55.164]  Dallas police seek blood tests for all DUI suspects.
[03:34:55.164 --> 03:34:58.205]  See, first, they started in Austin taking blood without warrants.
[03:34:58.205 --> 03:35:04.289]  Well, it was a rubber stamp warrant where the judge would say, test whoever you want.
[03:35:04.289 --> 03:35:05.710]  Lawsuits were filed.
[03:35:05.710 --> 03:35:11.773]  Arne Saavedra, federal guy, federal police chief, that's what he really is, was brought in out of California.
[03:35:11.773 --> 03:35:12.674]  He beta tested it.
[03:35:12.674 --> 03:35:14.655]  Now he's set to be the Dallas police chief.
[03:35:16.957 --> 03:35:17.918]  And I said that last week.
[03:35:17.918 --> 03:35:20.620]  I said he'll be up there with warrantless blood draws there.
[03:35:20.620 --> 03:35:25.863]  Now they just say everybody suspected will have blood taken without a warrant.
[03:35:25.863 --> 03:35:29.285]  Dallas police seek blood tests for all DUI suspects.
[03:35:29.285 --> 03:35:33.708]  And there's nothing in here about the Constitution or anything.
[03:35:33.708 --> 03:35:43.195]  Dallas police want to join growing national trend by making all suspected drunken drivers take a blood test, but the price tag for such a program will be too high for now.
[03:35:43.195 --> 03:35:45.857]  Oh, that's the only problem is the federal money.
[03:35:47.128 --> 03:35:53.792]  And there's a federal think tank that recommends Art Acevedo and all other police chiefs, and they put in these people in all the big departments.
[03:35:53.792 --> 03:35:56.313]  They're feds!
[03:35:56.313 --> 03:35:58.634]  Can we have a Texan be our police chief in Austin?
[03:35:58.634 --> 03:35:59.235]  No.
[03:35:59.235 --> 03:36:01.016]  Can we have someone born in America?
[03:36:01.016 --> 03:36:01.956]  No.
[03:36:01.956 --> 03:36:10.361]  He's got to be a guy from Cuba to bring us Fidel Castro type situations.
[03:36:10.361 --> 03:36:12.862]  Why do we put up with this?
[03:36:12.862 --> 03:36:16.324]  You know, we need police chiefs from Detroit, Michigan.
[03:36:17.543 --> 03:36:18.823]  I mean, it's kind of like Congress.
[03:36:18.823 --> 03:36:23.185]  People that run for Congress, who've lived in the district two or three years, they never win.
[03:36:23.185 --> 03:36:26.826]  People say, no, we want somebody who's lived here a long time.
[03:36:26.826 --> 03:36:32.828]  Even better, somebody, you know, you can say what you want about Rick Perry and I don't like him, but the guy at least is a fourth generation Texan.
[03:36:32.828 --> 03:36:36.990]  I mean, at least we got a governor who's got some roots here.
[03:36:36.990 --> 03:36:39.250]  You're supposed to have roots where you are.
[03:36:39.250 --> 03:36:41.251]  What's wrong with people?
[03:36:41.251 --> 03:36:43.712]  Why do we have all these foreigner police chiefs?
[03:36:43.712 --> 03:36:45.813]  Not even an American!
[03:36:45.813 --> 03:36:46.273]  I've had it!
[03:36:47.762 --> 03:36:49.144]  I've had it!
[03:36:49.144 --> 03:36:53.391]  You think in Cuba they would have a guy from Texas be their police chief?
[03:36:53.391 --> 03:36:56.235]  I don't know, maybe if he depressed the people.
[03:36:56.235 --> 03:36:57.357]  Or from New York?
[03:36:57.357 --> 03:36:59.120]  No, they'd never do that.
[03:36:59.120 --> 03:36:59.901]  This is treason.
[03:36:59.901 --> 03:37:01.564]  And I'm sick of it!
[03:37:04.088 --> 03:37:09.975]  Under a proposed policy, the breathalyzer would become a thing of the past and police would seek a search warrant.
[03:37:09.975 --> 03:37:11.216]  That's not even true.
[03:37:11.216 --> 03:37:14.380]  To get blood from any suspected DU driver who refused to take the blood test.
[03:37:14.380 --> 03:37:15.361]  What?
[03:37:15.361 --> 03:37:21.769]  A preliminary figure showing it costs $360,000 a year.
[03:37:21.769 --> 03:37:22.690]  And it goes on from there.
[03:37:24.753 --> 03:37:25.513]  Look at this article.
[03:37:25.513 --> 03:37:26.313]  AP exclusive.
[03:37:26.313 --> 03:37:28.894]  Pentagon gun was from Tennessee police.
[03:37:28.894 --> 03:37:35.776]  And it turns out from the same police lockup was the gun used in Nevada to shoot up that federal courthouse.
[03:37:35.776 --> 03:37:37.836]  How suspicious is that?
[03:37:37.836 --> 03:37:38.717]  Look at this article.
[03:37:38.717 --> 03:37:39.017]  U.S.
[03:37:39.017 --> 03:37:39.517]  and U.K.
[03:37:39.517 --> 03:37:41.477]  move closer to losing rating.
[03:37:41.477 --> 03:37:42.758]  Moody's says.
[03:37:42.758 --> 03:37:44.378]  Bloomberg.
[03:37:44.378 --> 03:37:44.858]  The U.S.
[03:37:44.858 --> 03:37:45.378]  and U.K.
[03:37:45.378 --> 03:37:49.659]  have moved substantially closer to losing their AAA credit rating.
[03:37:49.659 --> 03:37:50.860]  Mexico has a 1A.
[03:37:53.661 --> 03:38:04.903]  As the cost of servicing their debt rose according to Moody's Investor Service, there is inertia in the deteriorating, deterioration of credit metrics.
[03:38:04.903 --> 03:38:08.604]  What that means is the bankers have got us where they want us.
[03:38:08.604 --> 03:38:11.764]  And the Federal Reserve is now buying U.S.
[03:38:11.764 --> 03:38:15.165]  debt from itself.
[03:38:15.165 --> 03:38:21.146]  They buy their own debt with our tax money.
[03:38:21.146 --> 03:38:22.166]  Let me say that again.
[03:38:23.166 --> 03:38:28.228]  They buy their own debt and make a profit off of it with our money.
[03:38:28.228 --> 03:38:31.789]  I mean, that's such a scam, it doesn't even make sense.
[03:38:31.789 --> 03:38:33.649]  It doesn't even compute.
[03:38:33.649 --> 03:38:35.430]  And then they get all the power out of it.
[03:38:35.430 --> 03:38:37.231]  This is where they want you.
[03:38:37.231 --> 03:38:39.511]  They want you under their control.
[03:38:39.511 --> 03:38:41.272]  Do you know what's going to happen if this goes through?
[03:38:41.272 --> 03:38:43.493]  Do you know what's going to happen as the dollar plunges?
[03:38:43.493 --> 03:38:45.033]  We've lost almost all our industry.
[03:38:45.033 --> 03:38:47.074]  All we've got is the stinking dollar, folks.
[03:38:47.074 --> 03:38:50.955]  And they're killing it incrementally right now as we cover and fall the Republic.
[03:38:53.590 --> 03:39:00.961]  Okay, I'm going to briefly get into this, but I want to try to get this lady on in the next week.
[03:39:00.961 --> 03:39:06.629]  Remember last year, Richard Poplosky, a former Marine,
[03:39:12.588 --> 03:39:14.370]  Was completely drunk.
[03:39:14.370 --> 03:39:15.931]  Got home at 3 a.m.
[03:39:15.931 --> 03:39:20.315]  The police report says he had one pit bull that was urinating all over the floor.
[03:39:20.315 --> 03:39:30.345]  You gotta love these young punks who get all these dogs and look at their mommy and then complain when mommy doesn't want the dog crapping and urinating all over the floor.
[03:39:30.345 --> 03:39:35.109]  And he got a second pit bull and it was urinating.
[03:39:35.109 --> 03:39:37.712]  And his mother said, those dogs go or you go.
[03:39:40.219 --> 03:39:44.502]  Then she calls the police to throw him and the dogs out.
[03:39:44.502 --> 03:39:46.964]  He has a tenter tantrum.
[03:39:46.964 --> 03:39:52.308]  The police pull up and he cold-bloodedly murders three of them.
[03:39:52.308 --> 03:40:02.195]  Now, when the Mexican troops or drug cartels kill cops, it's kept quiet, but because this guy was a citizen, they made a big deal out of it, and they should have.
[03:40:02.195 --> 03:40:05.918]  Within two hours of him being arrested, this is what creeps me out.
[03:40:08.590 --> 03:40:21.474]  It was in the newspaper, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, that he was a fan of Alex Jones, and they had some guy on the news pop up in front of his house and say he liked Alex Jones, and then put this weird smile on his face.
[03:40:21.474 --> 03:40:29.396]  Then we went and searched his name on our site, message boards attacking me, saying I'm bad, saying I'm evil, because I'm not a white supremacist.
[03:40:31.630 --> 03:40:32.671]  Never liked me.
[03:40:32.671 --> 03:40:34.031]  Never supported me.
[03:40:34.031 --> 03:40:35.893]  But that's not the issue.
[03:40:35.893 --> 03:40:41.816]  Within two hours, they were saying, Alex Jones did this.
[03:40:41.816 --> 03:40:43.217]  I'm the main target.
[03:40:43.217 --> 03:40:48.480]  And all the white supremacist groups, all of them, all the majors, it's come out over and over again to feds.
[03:40:48.480 --> 03:40:55.204]  I told you a decade ago, Hal Turner was a fed attacking me, threatening to kill judges constantly, calling for violence constantly.
[03:40:55.204 --> 03:40:56.064]  It was cartoonish.
[03:40:56.064 --> 03:40:58.225]  Works with Sean Hannity before.
[03:40:58.225 --> 03:40:58.906]  Total operative.
[03:40:59.784 --> 03:41:11.513]  It came out in federal court three months ago, Kurt Nimmo, linked to the Chicago Tribune and other papers, as well as the Boston Globe, where it said the FBI testified and federal prosecutors testified, and he had one mistrial, they let him go.
[03:41:11.513 --> 03:41:13.374]  On that one, he's back in for another thing.
[03:41:13.374 --> 03:41:14.895]  He threatened a bunch of state judges.
[03:41:14.895 --> 03:41:19.238]  He said, kill them, murder them.
[03:41:19.238 --> 03:41:22.661]  And so the states separately said, we don't care if he's a fed.
[03:41:22.661 --> 03:41:25.082]  So, looks like there's about to be another mistrial.
[03:41:25.082 --> 03:41:26.563]  In fact, pull that up for me.
[03:41:26.563 --> 03:41:28.205]  Hal Turner, AP, just click News.
[03:41:29.903 --> 03:41:34.566]  I covered it yesterday, but I can't find it in the stack.
[03:41:34.566 --> 03:41:41.910]  He was a Fed, and they said in the court documents we read on air that he's the highest level FBI agent there is.
[03:41:41.910 --> 03:41:45.092]  National security level.
[03:41:45.092 --> 03:41:46.973]  He's national security.
[03:41:46.973 --> 03:41:48.594]  So this is continuity of government.
[03:41:48.594 --> 03:41:53.957]  Not an asset, as I had said, an agent.
[03:41:53.957 --> 03:41:58.620]  Now the AP covers this up, it just says Turner claims he's an asset and was drawing out violent people.
[03:42:01.721 --> 03:42:06.225]  The issue is all the Nazi groups attack me 24-7 because they're fed run, folks.
[03:42:06.225 --> 03:42:10.588]  They don't like the show being effective against the banks, the New World Order.
[03:42:10.588 --> 03:42:15.052]  Hal Turner, a trained FBI agent provocateur.
[03:42:15.052 --> 03:42:15.673]  Scroll down.
[03:42:15.673 --> 03:42:19.336]  Kurt actually has screenshots of the court record.
[03:42:19.336 --> 03:42:20.657]  There's a link in that article.
[03:42:20.657 --> 03:42:22.718]  That may just be one of many Kurt's written.
[03:42:22.718 --> 03:42:24.139]  Yeah, there's the Associated Press.
[03:42:24.139 --> 03:42:25.561]  Oh, that's the article he did last week.
[03:42:25.561 --> 03:42:26.041]  Yeah.
[03:42:26.041 --> 03:42:29.944]  No, no, he had a previous one with the court documents from a few months ago.
[03:42:29.944 --> 03:42:30.405]  But, uh,
[03:42:31.533 --> 03:42:33.094]  Here's the issue.
[03:42:33.094 --> 03:42:37.798]  Within two hours, I'm in the headline.
[03:42:37.798 --> 03:42:38.858]  I caused it, I did it.
[03:42:38.858 --> 03:42:51.868]  Now, it turns out the writer that wrote this, and then we got a retraction from Raw Story, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, a bunch of other big, I think it was five retractions, saying, okay, Poplowski didn't like Alex Jones.
[03:42:51.868 --> 03:42:55.570]  Because I quietly said, look, I don't just threaten to sue people.
[03:42:55.570 --> 03:42:57.111]  I've sued people before.
[03:42:57.111 --> 03:43:00.654]  I don't want to waste time and money, but you just can't say I'm causing cop killing.
[03:43:03.035 --> 03:43:05.936]  I mean, you can't say this is my fault, I'm going to have to defend myself.
[03:43:05.936 --> 03:43:08.477]  This is dangerous telling cops that I'm causing this.
[03:43:08.477 --> 03:43:13.019]  They'll set me up.
[03:43:13.019 --> 03:43:15.720]  I mean, you're really sicking law enforcement on me to destroy me.
[03:43:15.720 --> 03:43:18.101]  And they did a retraction.
[03:43:18.101 --> 03:43:22.222]  But they didn't remove the original article, they just wrote a separate article saying, well, Bloplosky didn't like Alex.
[03:43:22.222 --> 03:43:24.103]  But some of the publications did full retractions.
[03:43:26.437 --> 03:43:28.799]  Once I put the word out, because I was going to have to sue him.
[03:43:28.799 --> 03:43:34.565]  I mean, there's a lot of lies told about me, but you can't say I'm telling people to kill cops when I do the opposite, okay?
[03:43:34.565 --> 03:43:39.390]  I mean, that is dangerous, and I will sue you.
[03:43:39.390 --> 03:43:42.052]  Now, I just saw this this morning.
[03:43:44.687 --> 03:43:47.949]  This is an article out of Free Patriot Press.
[03:43:47.949 --> 03:43:52.212]  We've got it linked up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:43:52.212 --> 03:43:59.516]  Titled, Exclusive Interview with SPLC Director of Research, Heidi Bierich.
[03:44:03.871 --> 03:44:09.555]  The Southern Poverty Law Center recently issued an intelligence report on active patriot groups in the United States.
[03:44:09.555 --> 03:44:19.101]  And it basically says that anybody that talks about the New World Order is dangerous, and they list We Are Change, that's a total peace group, and they list myself, and now they're doing some cover story on me.
[03:44:19.101 --> 03:44:23.885]  They called me last week wanting quotes.
[03:44:23.885 --> 03:44:29.368]  And... In fact, I had that here in the article.
[03:44:29.368 --> 03:44:31.430]  Who's the lady that actually interviewed her?
[03:44:33.797 --> 03:44:35.278]  You're going to get it for me?
[03:44:35.278 --> 03:44:40.582]  I'm sorry, there's just so much here.
[03:44:40.582 --> 03:44:48.548]  But some local folks went in and talked to him, and I appreciate what they did, and they said, why are you demonizing We Are Change?
[03:44:48.548 --> 03:44:50.230]  And they say, like, they're God.
[03:44:50.230 --> 03:44:54.573]  Well, if you weren't putting out conspiracy theorists, we wouldn't put you on this list.
[03:44:54.573 --> 03:44:59.417]  Like, again, this is like Nazi Germany putting just whole groups of people on lists.
[03:44:59.417 --> 03:45:00.297]  It's a way to demonize.
[03:45:04.409 --> 03:45:06.450]  Rena McMasters, correct?
[03:45:06.450 --> 03:45:07.951]  I slated the interview.
[03:45:07.951 --> 03:45:10.432]  So, we're going to play a short clip of this.
[03:45:10.432 --> 03:45:13.153]  Again, it's linked up on InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[03:45:13.153 --> 03:45:20.756]  And here is the Director of Research for the entire Southern Poverty Law Center saying, I caused Poplosky to do this.
[03:45:20.756 --> 03:45:26.499]  These are the people that had their reporter, he writes stories about them and it's his beat.
[03:45:26.499 --> 03:45:30.621]  Promoting ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, demonizing groups, demonizing dissent.
[03:45:31.181 --> 03:45:39.103]  Within two hours, I get the blame, and now we hear it directly from the Southern Poverty Law Center, in this recorded conversation.
[03:45:39.103 --> 03:45:44.464]  You can hear the whole 17 or 20 minute clip, whatever it is, up on the website, but here's a clip of it.
[03:45:44.464 --> 03:45:47.764]  ...very bad things, and it happens all the time.
[03:45:47.764 --> 03:45:49.625]  So, this is what I have to say to you.
[03:45:49.625 --> 03:45:55.606]  If We Are Change doesn't want to be on the Patriot List, and you think these conspiracy theories are bad, get rid of them.
[03:45:56.406 --> 03:45:58.508]  Do you know where he got the idea to kill the cops?
[03:45:58.508 --> 03:45:59.028]  Alex Jones.
[03:45:59.028 --> 03:46:00.729]  He got the idea to kill cops from me!
[03:46:26.523 --> 03:46:28.304]  No evidence of that!
[03:46:28.304 --> 03:46:33.408]  Plopolsky attacked me on Stormfront's website on InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[03:46:33.408 --> 03:46:36.630]  We went and pulled his stinking comments up.
[03:46:36.630 --> 03:46:42.774]  We forced retractions in five publications that I can remember.
[03:46:42.774 --> 03:46:48.378]  And here they are in a taped interview saying I made him do that.
[03:46:52.509 --> 03:46:54.210]  I mean, this is demonization.
[03:46:54.210 --> 03:46:55.510]  This is defamation.
[03:46:55.510 --> 03:46:56.811]  This is slander.
[03:46:56.811 --> 03:47:02.653]  This is outrageous.
[03:47:02.653 --> 03:47:03.333]  Play it again.
[03:47:03.333 --> 03:47:03.653]  Here it is.
[03:47:18.680 --> 03:47:21.662]  You have a legitimate political position you're trying to push.
[03:47:21.662 --> 03:47:23.643]  This is killing you.
[03:47:23.643 --> 03:47:25.924]  It makes you look like a jerk.
[03:47:25.924 --> 03:47:26.204]  Anyhow.
[03:47:26.204 --> 03:47:29.086]  Hey guys.
[03:47:29.086 --> 03:47:31.127]  Okay, so we did the interview.
[03:47:31.127 --> 03:47:32.868]  Alright.
[03:47:32.868 --> 03:47:36.490]  And again, that's the end of the interview and there's a lot of other horrible stuff in there.
[03:47:36.490 --> 03:47:44.395]  But, on record, on tape, in an interview, I gave him the idea.
[03:47:44.395 --> 03:47:45.596]  This is very dangerous.
[03:47:47.554 --> 03:48:00.163]  And we see the talking point from Glenn Beck on the fake right, and Chris Matthews on the controlled left, that you're a racist, you're a hater, you're a terrorist, you're bad, you're gonna do violence if you're in the Tea Party, if you're a birther, if you're a truther.
[03:48:00.163 --> 03:48:02.025]  And then voila, it starts happening.
[03:48:02.025 --> 03:48:07.829]  Bare minimum, it's causing mentally ill people to get the idea in their head to go out and do this.
[03:48:07.829 --> 03:48:12.352]  But I mean, just how outrageous does this have to get?
[03:48:12.352 --> 03:48:14.714]  How much more evil do we have to be
[03:48:16.451 --> 03:48:17.051]  Witness to.
[03:48:17.051 --> 03:48:20.212]  Now, let me go ahead and go to this fluoride clip.
[03:48:20.212 --> 03:48:23.193]  There's a story up on InfoWars.com.
[03:48:23.193 --> 03:48:28.374]  Story on mystery substance distracts from fact fluoride is a deadly killer.
[03:48:28.374 --> 03:48:33.495]  We're talking about other poisons that might be in the fluoride from China that they're putting in drinking water.
[03:48:33.495 --> 03:48:37.596]  It's clogging up these Massachusetts water systems.
[03:48:37.596 --> 03:48:40.657]  Then, the newscast shows a bag of the fluoride.
[03:48:40.657 --> 03:48:44.078]  It says danger, poison, toxic by ingestion, target organs.
[03:48:44.980 --> 03:48:52.603]  Heart, kidneys, bones, central nervous system, gastrointestinal system, teeth, target organs, danger.
[03:48:52.603 --> 03:48:53.563]  They're targeting you.
[03:48:53.563 --> 03:48:56.604]  It's on the bag, but they're saying forget that it says it's poison.
[03:48:56.604 --> 03:48:58.505]  Could there be other poison being added?
[03:48:58.505 --> 03:48:59.345]  Let's start going to the clip.
[03:49:02.176 --> 03:49:10.284]  Water in Amesbury is supposed to have fluoride in it, but Rob Damaris has been concerned for years about what's in the supply he gets from China.
[03:49:10.284 --> 03:49:15.809]  The residue you see here is what won't dissolve when he puts the fluoride powder in the water.
[03:49:15.809 --> 03:49:16.790]  What is that?
[03:49:16.790 --> 03:49:17.450]  We don't know.
[03:49:17.450 --> 03:49:19.152]  You have no idea what's in there?
[03:49:19.152 --> 03:49:19.793]  I don't know what it is.
[03:49:19.793 --> 03:49:21.915]  It's not soluble.
[03:49:21.915 --> 03:49:26.159]  And it doesn't appear to be sodium fluoride, so we're not quite sure what it is.
[03:49:26.550 --> 03:49:32.053]  Damaris says the residue clogs his machines and makes it difficult to get a consistent mix.
[03:49:32.053 --> 03:49:41.279]  For almost a year, these fluoride pumps in Amesbury have been off, and the Water Department says they'll stay off until they can figure out what's in the fluoride.
[03:49:41.279 --> 03:49:52.146]  The Department of Public Health says more than 650,000 customers in 44 communities are getting the product in question, and only Amesbury has temporarily stopped using it.
[03:49:52.506 --> 03:49:55.047]  But despite those concerns, we want to be clear.
[03:49:55.047 --> 03:50:00.530]  Both state and federal health officials tell Team 5 Investigates, Chinese fluoride is safe.
[03:50:00.530 --> 03:50:02.811]  Alright, hit pause.
[03:50:02.811 --> 03:50:11.176]  And we're going to play when we come back from break, but health officials say Chinese fluoride is safe.
[03:50:11.176 --> 03:50:17.359]  Under the federal regulations, they're allowed to put over 300 chemicals in your water under the name sodium fluoride.
[03:50:18.547 --> 03:50:21.750]  So there's mercury, lead, arsenic, aluminum.
[03:50:21.750 --> 03:50:27.876]  This is the toxic waste from nuclear weapons production, aluminum production, and fertilizer production.
[03:50:27.876 --> 03:50:29.078]  On record!
[03:50:29.078 --> 03:50:34.783]  And they know it's a deadly chemical that attacks the bones, the brain, reduces fertility, increases cancer.
[03:50:34.783 --> 03:50:36.285]  That's all the studies.
[03:50:36.285 --> 03:50:38.007]  But this newscast isn't about that.
[03:50:38.007 --> 03:50:39.848]  Oh, here's a bag that says deadly poison.
[03:50:40.569 --> 03:50:41.790]  The deadly poison's good.
[03:50:41.790 --> 03:50:44.451]  We're worried a mystery substance is in this.
[03:50:44.451 --> 03:50:46.191]  That's what it is!
[03:50:46.191 --> 03:50:50.053]  It's a mystery substance because they're allowed to put whatever they want.
[03:50:50.053 --> 03:51:00.857]  Like cigarette companies under their patents can put hundreds of deadly chemicals in the cigarettes and not even tell you what's in it because it's a trade secret, a mystery ingredient, a mystery sauce.
[03:51:00.857 --> 03:51:01.838]  The super sauce!
[03:51:02.398 --> 03:51:11.103]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[03:51:11.103 --> 03:51:16.226]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the U.S.
[03:51:16.226 --> 03:51:17.087]  and Canada.
[03:51:17.087 --> 03:51:23.631]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[03:51:24.191 --> 03:51:27.595]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[03:51:27.595 --> 03:51:30.037]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.
[03:51:30.037 --> 03:51:36.644]  This nutrient-dense food can be stored up to five years when vacuum packed and is priced affordably to be used as a storable food.
[03:51:36.644 --> 03:51:40.167]  HempUSA.org is a bulk shipper starting with five pounds and up.
[03:51:40.167 --> 03:51:44.031]  To allow this food to work for you, call 908-691-2608 or go to HempUSA.org and order today.
[03:51:47.194 --> 03:51:50.357]  The body will react and heal itself given the proper nutrition.
[03:51:50.357 --> 03:51:52.559]  This superfood will be your greatest asset.
[03:51:52.559 --> 03:51:56.223]  So try it today, store it today, and change your life.
[03:51:56.223 --> 03:52:02.909]  Call 908-691-2608 or order from hempusa.org.
[03:52:02.909 --> 03:52:06.892]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:06.892 --> 03:52:10.155]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:10.155 --> 03:52:11.577]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:52:12.259 --> 03:52:14.941]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:14.941 --> 03:52:21.326]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:21.326 --> 03:52:26.890]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:26.890 --> 03:52:36.518]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:36.638 --> 03:52:38.979]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:38.979 --> 03:52:40.559]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:40.559 --> 03:52:43.020]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:43.020 --> 03:52:45.140]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:45.140 --> 03:52:50.281]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:50.281 --> 03:52:55.303]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:52:55.303 --> 03:52:59.404]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:53:01.084 --> 03:53:06.546]  For safety, you lock doors, set alarms, buy antivirus software, maybe even have a watchdog.
[03:53:06.546 --> 03:53:08.846]  Do you care as much about your air and water?
[03:53:08.846 --> 03:53:12.727]  Lock out harmful poisons from entering your body with AirAndAqua.com.

[03:53:30.592 --> 03:53:39.918]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[03:53:39.918 --> 03:53:46.982]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[03:53:46.982 --> 03:53:50.904]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[03:53:51.104 --> 03:53:51.924]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[03:53:51.924 --> 03:53:52.785]  It's time to understand the system.
[03:53:52.785 --> 03:53:52.985]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:53:52.985 --> 03:53:53.345]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:53:53.345 --> 03:53:54.205]  Well, it's the final segment.
[03:54:07.785 --> 03:54:13.549]  I had Noah Taylor, big Hollywood star, on talking about the New World Order for 45 minutes of the first hour.
[03:54:13.549 --> 03:54:21.155]  You'll definitely want to check that out in the retransmission on the audio streams at InfoWars.com or subscribe to the free podcast.
[03:54:21.155 --> 03:54:34.805]  Don't forget that if you have a iPhone or your friends or family have an iPhone, you can go to InfoWars.com, get the link, and send it to your friends and family or neighbors or co-workers to the free iPhone 5-star app.
[03:54:35.660 --> 03:54:38.921]  We appreciate everybody's five-star ratings there.
[03:54:38.921 --> 03:54:41.923]  It's pretty much a perfect app.
[03:54:41.923 --> 03:54:46.565]  There's like 60 haters in there desperately downloading it, trying to knock off its five stars.
[03:54:46.565 --> 03:54:49.726]  So folks, go in there and give it five stars.
[03:54:49.726 --> 03:54:55.428]  Talk about desperation, lying about an app to try to knock it off five stars, because not many apps have five stars.
[03:54:57.310 --> 03:55:00.051]  Story on mystery substance distracts from fact.
[03:55:00.051 --> 03:55:01.372]  Fluoride is deadly killer.
[03:55:01.372 --> 03:55:03.013]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[03:55:03.013 --> 03:55:09.215]  Everybody should get this article because it has all the government documents and links to the cancer, the brain damage, the infertility, all the proof.
[03:55:09.215 --> 03:55:12.697]  But again, talk about a psychological bait and switch.
[03:55:12.697 --> 03:55:17.739]  On the bag, it says danger, poison, toxic by ingestion, target organs.
[03:55:17.739 --> 03:55:18.920]  That's what they're targeting.
[03:55:18.920 --> 03:55:22.841]  The heart, kidneys, bones, central nervous system, gastrointestinal system.
[03:55:22.841 --> 03:55:24.082]  Deadly poison.
[03:55:25.029 --> 03:55:26.131]  But that's not the problem.
[03:55:26.131 --> 03:55:28.736]  They're worried something else might be in it.
[03:55:28.736 --> 03:55:35.067]  And they're very worried the people aren't getting their fluoride in this one community.
[03:55:35.067 --> 03:55:36.289]  Let's go ahead and continue with the clip.
[03:55:36.903 --> 03:55:42.769]  The company which supplies the fluoride in question says it is certified by the National Sanitation Foundation.
[03:55:42.769 --> 03:55:45.672]  It allows you to put whatever poison you want in it.
[03:55:45.672 --> 03:55:55.321]  And despite a thousand complaints, the Centers for Disease Control also says it's safe, although testing continues to determine the precise composition of the residue.
[03:55:55.321 --> 03:55:58.224]  But they should test it to make sure that what they're putting in is safe for us to drink.
[03:55:58.524 --> 03:56:04.729]  Paul Stewart lives in Newburyport and believes he has a right to know exactly what's in his wallet.
[03:56:04.729 --> 03:56:06.111]  Look at this spin.
[03:56:06.111 --> 03:56:07.572]  Oh, I want my fluoride.
[03:56:07.572 --> 03:56:10.054]  I want to make sure whatever else is in there is safe.
[03:56:10.054 --> 03:56:19.322]  The fluoride isn't not just safe, it's a chemical weapon used by the communists in Russia and Nazi Germany, by the fascists, to brain damage and make people servile.
[03:56:19.322 --> 03:56:21.024]  That's what it does, like lithium.
[03:56:21.963 --> 03:56:23.064]  Do you understand?
[03:56:23.064 --> 03:56:24.746]  You're being forcibly medicated.
[03:56:24.746 --> 03:56:25.367]  Continue.
[03:56:25.367 --> 03:56:34.436]  On the same day that I read the story about the fluoride coming from China, I also read stories about the melamine that was being contaminated in milk products coming from China.
[03:56:34.436 --> 03:56:41.484]  That, you know, Abercrombie & Fitch actually pulled some of their jewelry off the shelves because it was contaminated with cadmium coming from China.
[03:56:41.484 --> 03:56:44.467]  And then we had another story about more lead in kids toys coming from China.
[03:56:44.827 --> 03:56:52.835]  Since 2007, most of the sodium fluoride has also been imported from China because it's the least expensive on the market.
[03:56:52.835 --> 03:56:57.179]  I don't think that when it comes to something that I ingest every day, the lowest bidder is good enough.
[03:56:57.179 --> 03:56:59.922]  I'd like to be able to add it in, you know, worry-free.
[03:56:59.922 --> 03:57:01.303]  Oh, he'd like to help us.
[03:57:01.303 --> 03:57:02.704]  I'm Kelly Tuthill.
[03:57:02.704 --> 03:57:03.946]  Oh, he'd like to help us.
[03:57:05.669 --> 03:57:07.289]  This is the brainwashing.
[03:57:07.289 --> 03:57:08.650]  This is the mind control.
[03:57:08.650 --> 03:57:21.112]  They're adding sodium fluoride, and that's a catch-all name for hundreds of chemicals, to your water because it's a toxic waste that these companies would have to store or get rid of.
[03:57:21.112 --> 03:57:30.113]  But instead, they sell it to you, and you pay to be brain damaged, and pay to develop cancer, and pay to dumb your children down.
[03:57:30.113 --> 03:57:33.974]  This is like banging your kid's head up against the wall once a week.
[03:57:35.100 --> 03:57:36.261]  I've seen major studies.
[03:57:36.261 --> 03:57:42.068]  You lose as much as 10 IQ points in just four to five years of ingesting one part per million of fluoride.
[03:57:42.068 --> 03:57:47.955]  And that's not counting the toothpaste that says on the back, if you swallow more than a pea size, call poison control immediately.
[03:57:47.955 --> 03:57:50.258]  They're now springing on crops as a pesticide.
[03:57:50.258 --> 03:57:51.800]  Yeah, it kills bugs.
[03:57:51.800 --> 03:57:53.241]  But then it goes into the crops and you eat it.
[03:57:54.022 --> 03:57:55.504]  It's in most of the processed food.
[03:57:55.504 --> 03:57:56.665]  They're adding it everywhere now.
[03:57:56.665 --> 03:57:58.587]  Because you're going to love your government.
[03:57:58.587 --> 03:58:04.354]  You're going to accept the warrantless blood taking checkpoints and the laptops they give your school kids watching you at home.
[03:58:04.354 --> 03:58:07.177]  And the chemtrails and the tyranny and the foreign banks.
[03:58:07.177 --> 03:58:12.343]  Because you're so chemically poisoned and docile you can't even get angry.
[03:58:12.844 --> 03:58:14.305]  The testosterone's lowering.
[03:58:14.305 --> 03:58:15.085]  Fluoride does that.
[03:58:15.085 --> 03:58:17.746]  The sperm counts have plunged by over 85%.
[03:58:17.746 --> 03:58:19.947]  You are under chemical attack.
[03:58:19.947 --> 03:58:21.428]  You are being brain damaged.
[03:58:21.428 --> 03:58:27.930]  Our life expectancy's gone down if you average out the infant deaths they used to have 100 years ago.
[03:58:27.930 --> 03:58:33.553]  People live longer than if you averaged out those deaths of children dying when they were young.
[03:58:33.553 --> 03:58:34.733]  Alright, we're out of time.
[03:58:34.733 --> 03:58:35.854]  Retransmission starts now.
[03:58:35.854 --> 03:58:37.574]  Key interview with Noah Taylor.
[03:58:37.574 --> 03:58:38.295]  Straight ahead.
[03:58:38.295 --> 03:58:38.895]  Great job, crew.
