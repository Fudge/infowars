[00:00:04.794 --> 00:00:05.455]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.095 --> 00:00:07.156]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.857 --> 00:00:08.978]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:10.440]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:12.182]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:16.446]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.946 --> 00:00:21.011]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.776 --> 00:00:23.956]  Well, here we are.
[00:00:24.096 --> 00:00:27.497]  It's Friday, the 20th day of August 2010.
[00:00:27.577 --> 00:00:35.660]  We have our once-a-week visit with Bob Chapman coming up in the third hour to talk about the economy and world events.
[00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.961]  I'm going to cover just huge amounts of vital news and information.
[00:00:40.521 --> 00:00:44.583]  Then we, of course, are going to be taking your phone calls throughout the full transmission.
[00:00:44.963 --> 00:00:47.604]  And I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:00:47.684 --> 00:00:51.645]  Central, for the abbreviated Sunday broadcast as well.
[00:00:53.208 --> 00:00:56.769]  Look at the strange stack, I would call it today, of news.
[00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:59.250]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.072]  Radioactive boars on the rise in Germany.
[00:01:05.492 --> 00:01:09.633]  Radioactive boars on the rise in Germany from Chernobyl.
[00:01:10.754 --> 00:01:21.317]  They forage and eat different types of plants and things, and tuberous roots and mushrooms, and then it bioaccumulates in their bodies.
[00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.661]  Something out of a science fiction movie, but here it is.
[00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:25.301]  Here's another one.
[00:01:25.982 --> 00:01:28.763]  One must take shorter showers, says Prince Charles.
[00:01:29.483 --> 00:01:32.665]  Prince urges British families to snub the bathtub.
[00:01:33.245 --> 00:01:49.193]  And of course, the New York Times has reported how great it is that school children all over the United States are taught to write fake tickets that the school issues them to their parents for taking baths or leaving the water on while they brush their teeth with their brain-damaging sodium fluoride.
[00:01:49.673 --> 00:01:59.222]  So we're being trained to be good little serfs while Prince Charles has more than 10 jet aircraft in his own private train and more than 20 palaces.
[00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:04.240]  It's kind of like Ted Turner says you shouldn't be able to have more than one child.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.860]  He has five children.
[00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.902]  Study touts horse tranquilizers, ketamine, as magic antidepressant they want to give your children.
[00:02:13.442 --> 00:02:15.042]  That's out of the French News Agency.
[00:02:15.442 --> 00:02:17.083]  Here's another one, back in the news.
[00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:19.743]  We told you about this years ago, but here it is in the London Telegraph.
[00:02:20.084 --> 00:02:22.324]  Pregnant women should avoid diet soft drinks.
[00:02:22.744 --> 00:02:27.205]  It causes premature birth, miscarriages, low birth weights, you name it.
[00:02:27.225 --> 00:02:29.206]  Of course, then they mention later in the article
[00:02:30.171 --> 00:02:35.634]  It's the aspartame, but the headline is diet soft drinks.
[00:02:35.774 --> 00:02:47.760]  No, there's many types of diet out there that haven't been proven to be dangerous, like aspartame, the fecal matter excreted by E. coli bacteria, genetically engineered bacteria.
[00:02:47.961 --> 00:02:49.101]  That's what aspartame is.
[00:02:49.682 --> 00:02:51.903]  There's lots of things that taste sweet that aren't good for you.
[00:02:52.563 --> 00:02:55.765]  Tell that to your kitty cat or your dog when it drinks the antifreeze.
[00:02:56.265 --> 00:03:00.547]  We had a cat, my wife and I, that drank some neighbor's antifreeze and died a painful death.
[00:03:00.567 --> 00:03:02.608]  We had to put it to sleep when it was in a coma.
[00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:06.510]  But again, soon they'll be telling you Aspartame's nutritious.
[00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:11.933]  Continuing, seasonal H1N1 flu vaccine to be combined this fall.
[00:03:12.594 --> 00:03:16.336]  They've admitted that the last push last year and this year was a hoax.
[00:03:17.356 --> 00:03:35.768]  and uh... the british government admits a tenfold ten-time increase uh... in convulsions seizures for under five-year-olds to take it but their answer is hey we're going to combo it mix it with a regular flu shot this year and go ahead and push the entire fraud again uh... on
[00:03:36.568 --> 00:03:37.149]  Everyone.
[00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.153]  So we'll be discussing some of that as well today.
[00:03:42.873 --> 00:03:47.317]  In economic news, Social Security cuts weighed by panel.
[00:03:48.658 --> 00:03:55.143]  A White House credit commission is considering proposals to raise the retirement age and take other steps to cut Social Security.
[00:03:55.163 --> 00:03:57.725]  That's in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:03:57.785 --> 00:04:05.632]  Continuing, nearly half of the United States states considering Arizona-style immigration legislation.
[00:04:07.192 --> 00:04:11.775]  Continuing, Moscow on security alert after North Caucasus bombings.
[00:04:13.136 --> 00:04:18.218]  And we will continue with some of the other Orwellian news of the day.
[00:04:18.238 --> 00:04:21.700]  Headline, Orwell in charge.
[00:04:22.481 --> 00:04:26.603]  Kucinich compares Iraq exit to Bush's mission accomplished.
[00:04:26.703 --> 00:04:27.344]  And that's what it is.
[00:04:28.024 --> 00:04:34.429]  They've removed some of the troops to send them to Afghanistan, but they've increased the contractors and still have U.S.
[00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:39.053]  troops in combat operations, but the media is all hailing the end of the war.
[00:04:39.853 --> 00:04:48.940]  Didn't Bush, just three months into the invasion, dress up in a fighter pilot outfit with a cod piece, like something out of Spinal Tap, going through the metal detector?
[00:04:51.083 --> 00:04:53.248]  Say that mission was accomplished?
[00:04:53.288 --> 00:04:54.752]  Well, now we've seen this again.
[00:04:55.133 --> 00:04:58.282]  We'll cover that and a lot more on the other side of this quick break.
[00:04:58.302 --> 00:04:58.743]  Stay with us.
[00:04:59.946 --> 00:05:03.767]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:29.736]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[00:06:30.036 --> 00:06:31.437]  Buy American and stay clean.

[00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:51.460]  Thank you!
[00:06:59.056 --> 00:07:03.279]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:04.200]  Number 1.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.662]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:07.943 --> 00:07:08.503]  Number 2.
[00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:13.347]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:13.687 --> 00:07:14.127]  It's true.
[00:07:14.427 --> 00:07:18.991]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:19.311 --> 00:07:19.851]  Number 3.
[00:07:20.132 --> 00:07:23.414]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:23.714 --> 00:07:27.417]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:27.617 --> 00:07:28.158]  Number 4.
[00:07:28.418 --> 00:07:30.780]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.564]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:34.864 --> 00:07:35.064]  Number 5.
[00:07:35.645 --> 00:07:39.568]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:39.788 --> 00:07:44.553]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:44.833 --> 00:07:48.875]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:49.015 --> 00:07:50.576]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:50.796 --> 00:07:52.877]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:07:53.037 --> 00:07:54.798]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:07:54.938 --> 00:07:55.319]  Big Brother.
[00:07:55.419 --> 00:07:55.859]  Mainstream Media.
[00:08:05.914 --> 00:08:07.015]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:07.675 --> 00:08:09.116]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:08:09.776 --> 00:08:10.997]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:11.917 --> 00:08:16.600]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:21.605 --> 00:08:25.606]  It is Friday, 20th day of August, 1-2-10.
[00:08:25.626 --> 00:08:38.789]  I'm going to get into the news in detail from around the planet as we track the scientific dictatorship, the private-corporate takeover that is taking place, and then we'll take your phone calls.
[00:08:39.469 --> 00:08:41.610]  It is wide open phones today.
[00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:42.390]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:45.873]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us on this live Friday broadcast.
[00:08:45.893 --> 00:08:48.154]  And again, I'll be back this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:08:48.174 --> 00:08:49.775]  with the abbreviated Sunday Transmission.
[00:09:01.824 --> 00:09:03.125]  Let's just start right here.
[00:09:03.145 --> 00:09:10.991]  High-tech carts will tell on Cleveland residents who don't recycle and they will face a $100 fine per infraction.
[00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:27.694]  And of course, all of the major retailers and suppliers are building the tags in by design for worldwide distribution where everything you will buy and sell will be tracked.
[00:09:28.075 --> 00:09:33.257]  And if you don't properly recycle it, and that's just the cover story to fund the program, you will be fined.
[00:09:33.877 --> 00:09:34.918]  So it's total surveillance.
[00:09:34.938 --> 00:09:35.718]  We have another report.
[00:09:36.038 --> 00:09:41.482]  An entire city is installing retina scanners to buy and sell in a, quote, test.
[00:09:42.142 --> 00:09:52.129]  I remember 12 years ago reading the Pentagon documents that were public, MIT documents, where they said every product in the world will have RFID in it.
[00:09:52.609 --> 00:09:54.130]  Everything you do will be tracked.
[00:09:54.871 --> 00:10:01.195]  It will basically allow you to, the government to, do a Google-type search of the real world.
[00:10:01.915 --> 00:10:08.761]  Not just the internet or cyberspace or that dimension, but the third dimension that we actually live in.
[00:10:09.884 --> 00:10:12.246]  And so this is the total surveillance system.
[00:10:12.586 --> 00:10:21.933]  And I would come on air and warn people that they're going to use these RFID tags in all your products, and then you'll have to sort them in very complex ways in your bins.
[00:10:23.034 --> 00:10:32.901]  And they're going to have spies digging through your trash cans, but also they're going to have special meter reading systems on the trash trucks that will scan all of this.
[00:10:33.541 --> 00:10:35.183]  And now it is here.
[00:10:35.723 --> 00:10:40.307]  Of course, England implemented it about seven years after we learned of it, five years ago.
[00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:42.208]  They're now implementing it here.
[00:10:42.288 --> 00:10:44.590]  The total grid of control.
[00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:49.714]  And then they force you to pay for the RFID along with your purchase of the products.
[00:10:50.074 --> 00:10:51.876]  And then don't even give you an opportunity.
[00:10:52.656 --> 00:10:54.097]  What was it in 2002?
[00:10:54.178 --> 00:11:03.004]  Walmart and the Defense Department teamed up, according to the Associated Press, to demand that all of their suppliers put these government-approved chips in.
[00:11:03.225 --> 00:11:04.606]  And this is worldwide.
[00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:06.127]  Worldwide.
[00:11:06.167 --> 00:11:10.371]  And Prince Charles is in the news saying you shouldn't be allowed to take a bath.
[00:11:11.011 --> 00:11:14.614]  You should only be allowed to sponge yourself off because there's no water.
[00:11:15.095 --> 00:11:16.316]  Water isn't renewable.
[00:11:16.636 --> 00:11:17.737]  Another complete lie.
[00:11:18.117 --> 00:11:21.540]  It's all about training you to have nothing with controlled austerity.
[00:11:21.861 --> 00:11:23.262]  They're going to take your pension funds.
[00:11:23.662 --> 00:11:27.525]  They're going to take your Social Security and several waves of cuts down to nothing.
[00:11:28.666 --> 00:11:49.183]  The tiny amount of chicken feed you get will be tied to government-run eugenics death panels that will cut all of the real treatments and care that can actually cure or treat serious illnesses while they introduce the chemical and bioweapons to the food and water to cause seriously degenerative and death-causing diseases.
[00:11:49.864 --> 00:11:51.145]  This is their master plan.
[00:11:51.685 --> 00:11:58.269]  So, high-tech carts will tell on Cleveland residents who don't recycle and they face a $100 fine.
[00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:02.992]  It would be a stretch to say Big Brother will hang out in Cleveland's trash cans.
[00:12:03.873 --> 00:12:05.053]  Well, no, it wouldn't be a stretch.
[00:12:05.474 --> 00:12:06.374]  What do they say in England?
[00:12:06.734 --> 00:12:11.917]  All the flights will have cameras that watch you in every seat, the back seat.
[00:12:14.048 --> 00:12:18.251]  of the person sitting in front of you will have a camera and a microphone recording everything you do.
[00:12:18.691 --> 00:12:22.153]  All cars, by law, they're trying to set these regulations.
[00:12:22.473 --> 00:12:25.315]  We'll have cameras that watch you real-time, dialed into the police.
[00:12:25.795 --> 00:12:28.056]  AI computers will be listening for keywords.
[00:12:28.457 --> 00:12:30.398]  It'll pick up on you screaming at your children.
[00:12:30.678 --> 00:12:32.479]  We'll immediately dial the health department.
[00:12:32.719 --> 00:12:33.960]  CPS will be dispatched.
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.382]  You will all be prisoners under 24-hour total surveillance.
[00:12:37.762 --> 00:12:42.065]  Over 22,000 homes in England, according to BBC, and they say it's good.
[00:12:42.705 --> 00:12:46.386]  At birth, the parents now have cameras installed in the home to watch them.
[00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:54.468]  If they don't change the diaper right, or the baby coughs, or the baby rolls off the bed, your child is gone into government control.
[00:12:55.488 --> 00:12:57.368]  Naked body scanners going in everywhere.
[00:12:57.428 --> 00:13:00.129]  They're saving the images, blasting your body with radiation.
[00:13:00.489 --> 00:13:01.349]  Total control.
[00:13:01.669 --> 00:13:03.750]  Forced inoculations are now being promoted.
[00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:05.070]  It's all happening.
[00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:06.831]  Worse than 1984.
[00:13:06.951 --> 00:13:08.371]  Totally criminal government.
[00:13:09.031 --> 00:13:11.434]  Face scanning cameras are in Austin where I live.
[00:13:11.774 --> 00:13:14.017]  License plate reading cameras are going up everywhere.
[00:13:14.337 --> 00:13:16.620]  Microphones went up 13 years ago.
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.243]  They called them gunshot detectors as a cover story.
[00:13:19.263 --> 00:13:20.744]  They now admit they're listening to us.
[00:13:21.145 --> 00:13:24.428]  It's all a big joke at the higher echelons of the police department.
[00:13:25.049 --> 00:13:29.575]  I even had the police chief in here during a break joking with the commander he brought along one time about it.
[00:13:30.055 --> 00:13:39.807]  The commander started talking and the police chief said, you're here to be with me and watch my back, not to talk, not to tell the slave what we're doing.
[00:13:41.048 --> 00:13:44.691]  It's so much fun to be a federally appointed police chief.
[00:13:44.751 --> 00:13:48.574]  I had a federal board tell the city they'd give them money if they appointed this police chief.
[00:13:48.794 --> 00:13:50.115]  It's the same in every major city.
[00:13:50.395 --> 00:13:58.060]  So here is the total surveillance bondage system and the establishment is laughing at all of you.
[00:13:58.321 --> 00:14:01.363]  Laughing all the way to their eugenics bank with it.
[00:14:02.691 --> 00:14:04.212]  But it says it would be a stretch.
[00:14:04.232 --> 00:14:07.074]  Yeah, it's a stretch to have everything you're putting in your trash track.
[00:14:07.614 --> 00:14:15.259]  You know, it's a stretch to have everything you do in your home being listened to by Google over the microphones in your computer and they admitted it four years ago.
[00:14:15.819 --> 00:14:27.426]  Yeah, it's a stretch to say that the schools are training kids to come home and boss their parents around about the environment and to write reports at school about how bad their parents are, training them to be spies against the family.
[00:14:27.666 --> 00:14:28.647]  That's not Big Brother.
[00:14:29.758 --> 00:14:30.759]  Yeah, it's a stretch.
[00:14:31.119 --> 00:14:32.160]  No, it's total Big Brother.
[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:45.790]  It would be a stretch to say that Big Brother will hang out in Cleveland's trash cans, but the city plans to sort through curbside trash to make sure residents are recycling and fine them $100 if they don't.
[00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:55.197]  This was always the stated plan and I would talk about it on the radio and get little emails and calls going, you're a kook, you know, the NSA doesn't exist.
[00:14:55.717 --> 00:14:58.159]  Oh yeah, just 10 years ago the media said it didn't even exist.
[00:14:58.704 --> 00:15:00.005]  NSA didn't exist.
[00:15:02.127 --> 00:15:02.667]  That's what they do.
[00:15:02.748 --> 00:15:04.149]  Oh, there's no world government.
[00:15:04.469 --> 00:15:06.010]  There's no Bilderberg Group.
[00:15:06.351 --> 00:15:08.092]  There's no Trilateral Commission.
[00:15:08.392 --> 00:15:10.514]  There's no... The banks aren't stealing money.
[00:15:10.534 --> 00:15:18.821]  You know, what happened when whistleblowers for 11 years went to the Securities and Exchange Commission with all of the fraud of Madoff robbing upwards of $100 billion?
[00:15:19.261 --> 00:15:20.663]  They just said, it doesn't exist.
[00:15:20.703 --> 00:15:21.904]  Sit down and shut up.
[00:15:23.601 --> 00:15:28.845]  It's a class of criminals at every level going completely hog wild.
[00:15:29.505 --> 00:15:40.533]  Continuing here, the move is part of a high-tech collection system the city will roll out next year with new trash and recycling carts embedded with radio frequency identification chips and barcodes.
[00:15:41.394 --> 00:15:44.816]  Yes, and they share the fines with the mafia trash companies.
[00:15:44.836 --> 00:15:48.318]  If you didn't know, the big trash companies are some of the most mafia connected groups.
[00:15:48.679 --> 00:15:49.759]  Well, you better do some research.
[00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:55.524]  The chips will also allow city workers to monitor how often residents roll carts to the curb for collection.
[00:15:56.065 --> 00:16:02.830]  If a chip shows a recyclable cart hasn't been brought to the curb in weeks, a trash supervisor will sort through the trash for recyclables.
[00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:07.033]  That's right, they're going to send an agent, a code enforcer, out to your house.
[00:16:07.454 --> 00:16:08.455]  You're going to do this.
[00:16:08.515 --> 00:16:11.837]  And they're going to come and do home inspections under the carbon tax law.
[00:16:12.398 --> 00:16:18.503]  And in one week, if you don't make changes to your house, the government, without a court, forfeits your home and evicts you and takes it.
[00:16:18.843 --> 00:16:21.184]  That's in the bill that passed the House, not the Senate.
[00:16:22.505 --> 00:16:23.766]  This is total tyranny!
[00:16:24.806 --> 00:16:35.052]  And they've got huge trained SWAT teams that if you try... You saw the reports of people all over the country being killed because they wouldn't open their door for the census worker?
[00:16:35.333 --> 00:16:39.715]  They just call the cops and the SWAT team just comes and knocks your door down and shoots you in your house!
[00:16:40.135 --> 00:16:44.038]  And then they do high fives and feel real manly and inject some roids!
[00:16:44.978 --> 00:16:51.841]  Then go home and shoot their kids up with mercury-filled shots and drink fluoride water and die of cancer themselves, and they love it.
[00:16:52.041 --> 00:16:53.502]  They love being mind-controlled.
[00:16:53.662 --> 00:16:54.942]  They love their petty power.
[00:16:55.202 --> 00:16:58.384]  And they just love all the power their masses are gonna give them.
[00:16:58.584 --> 00:17:00.505]  They just can't wait to get even more.
[00:17:00.565 --> 00:17:02.485]  It's so much fun to be part of tyranny.
[00:17:03.826 --> 00:17:10.689]  Then it goes on to say, you will get visits by them in a $100 fine per infraction if they catch one thing that's supposed to be recycled.
[00:17:11.696 --> 00:17:13.978]  In that regular trash can, you're getting a $100 fine.
[00:17:14.218 --> 00:17:20.123]  And of course, you saw all the reports about people losing their houses for less than $100 fines.
[00:17:20.804 --> 00:17:21.825]  It doesn't even go to court.
[00:17:21.865 --> 00:17:24.127]  Just, you don't pay the fine, didn't even know there was a fine.
[00:17:24.908 --> 00:17:27.570]  $300, $100, $400, you've seen the reports.
[00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:29.191]  Your house is gone.
[00:17:29.432 --> 00:17:35.817]  And again, you try to resist, SWAT teams will drop by and line you and your family up and just blow holes in you.
[00:17:36.858 --> 00:17:37.579]  Yeah!
[00:17:37.959 --> 00:17:42.803]  And don't try to videotape the cops, even though it's your own property and there's no perception of privacy.
[00:17:42.963 --> 00:17:44.364]  They'll take you to prison for that.
[00:17:45.365 --> 00:17:45.745]  Okay?
[00:17:45.785 --> 00:17:47.827]  That's just the way it works.
[00:17:47.847 --> 00:17:51.009]  And in 860 plus cities, the illegal aliens can run driving me above the law.
[00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:53.011]  Because they're here helping with the team.
[00:17:53.451 --> 00:17:57.514]  They're all going to get voting rights soon and they're going to vote to take your guns and you don't turn them in.
[00:17:57.755 --> 00:17:59.576]  Those SWAT team guys see you as the enemy.
[00:17:59.596 --> 00:18:00.236]  They're coming!
[00:18:00.577 --> 00:18:03.139]  It's a lot of fun to run the New World Order, isn't it?
[00:18:04.818 --> 00:18:07.581]  And it goes on, they're going to dig through your trash and everything else.
[00:18:07.621 --> 00:18:09.282]  You can go read that full report for yourself.
[00:18:09.302 --> 00:18:12.325]  Alright, I'm really starting to get mad.
[00:18:12.345 --> 00:18:15.588]  You know, I just covered one article and we've just blown through a whole segment.
[00:18:16.598 --> 00:18:19.240]  And this is what happens psychologically to me every day.
[00:18:19.521 --> 00:18:44.402]  I read this stuff in the afternoon the day before, I read it at night, I read it at the morning, I come in, the guys have found a bunch of news I hadn't even seen, I sit here for about 30 minutes going back over it, and then I just get freaked out and upset because I just scanned over probably about 75, 80, 100, I don't know, I haven't counted them, articles, and I just see pure evil everywhere, pure lies everywhere, pure corruption, they're getting ready for more pushing the flu shot,
[00:18:44.722 --> 00:18:52.126]  Lying on the news and saying it's mandatory and housewives will line up and their kids will get paralyzed or have Guillain-Barrés or have seizures.
[00:18:52.386 --> 00:19:02.931]  And if it's a little baby, it's even better when the little baby goes to the clinic and gets the shot and has a convulsion in the car and has blood running out their nose as tens of thousands do every time this happens.
[00:19:03.151 --> 00:19:08.133]  When they come back, the CPS comes with the cops and they take all the woman's little kids that are with her.
[00:19:08.173 --> 00:19:09.094]  They're in the waiting room.
[00:19:09.394 --> 00:19:24.602]  Not only do they make blood run out of babies' nose, not only do they savage babies' brain, admittedly, not only do they give them Gardasil shots, killing them deader than a hammer, but if your baby happens to survive the CPS with big, fat pedophiles, they're going to have their way with them, because they love it!
[00:19:24.863 --> 00:19:27.264]  They love it, and they know full well they're brain damaging them.
[00:19:27.444 --> 00:19:29.585]  They know full well what they're doing, and they love it.
[00:19:29.865 --> 00:19:31.746]  They love brain damaging your children.
[00:19:31.926 --> 00:19:36.629]  They love poisoning your water, and they love taking your kids once they degenerate them.
[00:19:36.849 --> 00:19:37.810]  It's so much fun!
[00:19:38.956 --> 00:19:40.937]  But hey, I'm not supposed to get mad by this.
[00:19:40.997 --> 00:19:42.018]  I'm supposed to like it!
[00:19:42.818 --> 00:19:54.164]  I'm supposed to love Bush three months into the Iraq invasion saying the war's over and now Obama did the same hoax and the public's just sucking down their lithium and Prozac and fluoride and loving it.
[00:19:54.484 --> 00:19:56.746]  Oh, and they can't wait to have their pension funds taken.
[00:19:56.886 --> 00:19:58.707]  They're just begging, oh please, rape us!
[00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:02.852]  Is your debt problem a ticking time bomb?
[00:20:03.072 --> 00:20:11.739]  Thanks to a new financial consumer relief program designed in response to the economic crisis facing millions of Americans, you don't have to wait until it's too late to defuse your debt.
[00:20:11.899 --> 00:20:24.190]  If you owe $10,000 or more in credit card bills and are struggling to make minimum payments, get ready to take down this number for free information that could potentially save your home, the lifestyle you're accustomed to, and your family's financial well-being.
[00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:25.050]  But don't wait!
[00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:28.253]  Studies show that if most debt problems are confronted directly,
[00:20:28.353 --> 00:20:28.713]  I think so.
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.963]  You must have $10,000 in credit card debt.
[00:20:48.023 --> 00:20:49.905]  Call the American Debt Associates at 800-876-2966.
[00:20:49.925 --> 00:20:50.005]  800-876-2966.
[00:20:50.025 --> 00:20:50.206]  Again, 800-876-2966.
[00:21:00.834 --> 00:21:05.295]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:22:02.255 --> 00:22:07.139]  The economy is crumbling, debt soaring, and the possibility of World War III is increasing.
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:19.129]  I started SurvivalistSeeds.com from my dining room table with a small bucket of seed and a single rotating banner ad on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:22:20.106 --> 00:22:27.671]  Two years later, we've sold over 40,000 pounds of heirloom seeds, becoming the largest bulk seed seller to the public.
[00:22:28.371 --> 00:22:32.074]  The majority of our customers are Alex Jones listeners.
[00:22:32.934 --> 00:22:48.124]  Now I'm offering 50 all-organic garden varieties, 10,000 heirloom seeds, garden planter, and a CD teaching you how to save seeds, so your children's children will always have healthy food.
[00:22:49.093 --> 00:22:50.894]  Don't wait until it's too late.
[00:22:51.815 --> 00:22:57.660]  I'm Vic John Lipscomb, and my company is survivalistseeds.com.
[00:23:00.262 --> 00:23:01.443]  Attention to all U.S.
[00:23:01.483 --> 00:23:09.089]  drivers who own a vehicle that has less than 130,000 miles with an auto warranty about to expire or no warranty coverage at all.
[00:23:09.449 --> 00:23:15.514]  Due to our country's economic crisis and auto repair costs on the rise, if your vehicle has less than 130,000 miles, as of today,
[00:23:17.836 --> 00:23:27.741]  You could be one of the millions of drivers that now may qualify to have your vehicle covered under United Repair Plans and have 100% of your future covered auto repair bills paid for you.
[00:23:28.121 --> 00:23:32.804]  This low-cost vehicle service contract has been established under United Repair Plans.
[00:23:33.024 --> 00:23:39.689]  And is now available to the general public in order to save drivers thousands of dollars on auto repairs during our country's recession.
[00:23:40.089 --> 00:23:48.455]  If you own a vehicle with less than 130,000 miles, you may now call to see if your vehicle qualifies and for a free 5-minute quote.
[00:23:48.795 --> 00:23:49.696]  Number to call is 800-809-4491.
[00:23:49.716 --> 00:23:49.756]  800-809-4491.
[00:23:49.776 --> 00:23:50.116]  Again, that's 800-809-4491.
[00:24:00.427 --> 00:24:01.308]  We are back live.
[00:24:01.488 --> 00:24:04.892]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.185]  Bob Chapman coming up in the third hour.
[00:24:27.207 --> 00:24:31.539]  I've got some big news concerning the Bilderberg Group coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:34.172 --> 00:24:38.354]  But we know that the H1N1 shot was a hoax, a fraud.
[00:24:38.454 --> 00:24:59.545]  British Medical Journal, EU Health Commission, Dr. Wolfgang Wudarg, their entire commission agreed there were payoffs made by Big Pharma to government officials in the US, England, and Europe to lie and push the hoax of a dangerous vaccine with a tenfold increase in convulsions.
[00:24:59.685 --> 00:25:03.587]  Many of the children get permanent epilepsy from it because it causes
[00:25:05.242 --> 00:25:06.542]  Brain inflammation.
[00:25:07.142 --> 00:25:09.023]  Chronic brain inflammation.
[00:25:10.043 --> 00:25:10.663]  That's what they're doing.
[00:25:10.703 --> 00:25:11.243]  And they're back.
[00:25:11.283 --> 00:25:12.643]  They're saying, we're getting ready again.
[00:25:12.963 --> 00:25:13.744]  The fall's coming.
[00:25:13.784 --> 00:25:15.724]  We're back with the H1N1 shots.
[00:25:16.604 --> 00:25:21.405]  We're gonna push them on you again and create all the fear and try to make everybody take this stuff.
[00:25:21.505 --> 00:25:24.006]  They never stop their crimes.
[00:25:25.186 --> 00:25:28.566]  The state is a rotten creation.
[00:25:29.267 --> 00:25:31.367]  And it was once said that war is the health of the state.
[00:25:33.308 --> 00:25:36.310]  War is the engine of the corrupt state.
[00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:40.812]  It is the growth hormone of the cancer that is big government.
[00:25:41.693 --> 00:25:44.675]  And speaking of war, let's get into that right now.
[00:25:44.735 --> 00:25:45.775]  Here's some interesting articles.
[00:25:46.195 --> 00:25:46.636]  Here's one.
[00:25:46.756 --> 00:25:47.696]  Orwell in charge.
[00:25:47.716 --> 00:25:52.019]  Kucinich compares Iraq exit to Bush's mission accomplished.
[00:25:52.499 --> 00:25:57.522]  Congressman Dennis Kucinich today challenged the notion that removing combat brigades, but leaving 50,000 U.S.
[00:25:57.842 --> 00:26:00.364]  troops in Iraq, constitutes an end to combat operations.
[00:26:01.224 --> 00:26:02.965]  Let alone an end to the war.
[00:26:03.485 --> 00:26:08.968]  A press release sent to Raw Story on Thursday states, who is in charge of operations in Iraq now?
[00:26:09.108 --> 00:26:09.829]  George Orwell?
[00:26:10.249 --> 00:26:14.291]  A war based on lies continues to be a war based on lies today.
[00:26:15.932 --> 00:26:21.435]  And continuing, there's another headline, Iraq exit, rebranding the occupation.
[00:26:22.856 --> 00:26:23.476]  Here's another one.
[00:26:24.317 --> 00:26:27.659]  French news agency, despite new mission, U.S.
[00:26:27.699 --> 00:26:29.580]  troops still in the fight in Iraq.
[00:26:30.731 --> 00:26:37.097]  And the AP reported yesterday, well, they're going to have private CIA and contractors working with the local police.
[00:26:37.117 --> 00:26:43.884]  Yes, snatch and grab, torture squads, death squads, assassination squads, black sites.
[00:26:45.525 --> 00:26:46.887]  This is what America is becoming.
[00:26:46.907 --> 00:26:54.554]  This is what they're setting up here with Top Secret USA, with close to a million secret private spies working with contractors and the CIA.
[00:26:55.996 --> 00:27:01.699]  And getting huge government no-bid contracts out of it with a $2 trillion a year total budget.
[00:27:02.379 --> 00:27:06.701]  On budget, it's $1.1 trillion, but the rest of the budget for defense is $900 billion.
[00:27:07.302 --> 00:27:11.744]  $2 trillion a year, and this military doesn't belong to us.
[00:27:11.864 --> 00:27:12.944]  It doesn't fight for us.
[00:27:13.264 --> 00:27:18.267]  It fights for the Ken Lay, Bernie Madoff types that run this global banking Ponzi scheme.
[00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:31.920]  I was listening to NPR yesterday, and it's just all these simpering, snake-like, hiss-like, all to be calm, and, oh, we've got to hit Iran, they've got nukes, they're going to get us.
[00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:33.901]  Let's go to Jeffrey Goldberg.
[00:27:33.921 --> 00:27:42.308]  You know, they didn't tell the listeners, oh, this is the guy that helped propagandize about non-existent WMDs, and he went on and, you know, just
[00:27:43.289 --> 00:27:44.370]  And they had the other guest on.
[00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:47.213]  They both agreed Iran is bad and is going to have to be hit.
[00:27:47.774 --> 00:27:50.297]  It's sad and we don't like it, but it's liberal.
[00:27:50.957 --> 00:27:52.699]  We've got to have a new war.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:59.486]  And the combat is over in Iraq, just like Bush said seven and a half years ago.
[00:28:00.404 --> 00:28:04.206]  That the military operations are now over and he was wearing a G.I.
[00:28:04.226 --> 00:28:08.588]  Joe outfit and he was wearing an aviator flight suit and he was so tough!
[00:28:09.128 --> 00:28:12.070]  Walking around with his arms like this, I'm tough!
[00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:14.451]  Mission accomplished!
[00:28:15.011 --> 00:28:16.352]  And it's the same thing here.
[00:28:18.677 --> 00:28:19.837]  It's the same operation.
[00:28:20.537 --> 00:28:26.599]  They're just taking the troops out of Iraq that are leaving, keeping a bunch there and moving them to Afghanistan to menace Pakistan.
[00:28:27.079 --> 00:28:27.299]  U.S.
[00:28:27.359 --> 00:28:37.921]  troops will still be in combat and taking on Islamist militants in Iraq even as the American military moves to advise and assist role with a smaller force, officials said Thursday.
[00:28:38.181 --> 00:28:39.162]  The withdrawal of U.S.
[00:28:39.202 --> 00:28:40.302]  Combat Brigade.
[00:28:40.962 --> 00:28:52.632]  Yeah, we now have Brigade Homeland, for us the enemy here in America, on Thursday was hailed as a symbolic movement for the controversial American presence in Iraq more than seven years since the invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein.
[00:28:53.853 --> 00:29:00.519]  But the remaining 50,000 troops and 100 plus thousand contractors will no longer have a formal combat mission after September 1st.
[00:29:00.739 --> 00:29:08.406]  They will be well armed and possibly coming under fire as they join in manhunts for Al Qaeda figures and other extremists.
[00:29:10.049 --> 00:29:14.410]  And they had this army captain on with this real sweet little NPR.
[00:29:15.231 --> 00:29:27.154]  You could tell everyone on there and all their main intelligence operative guests have this real calm, sweet, non-threatening voice and he said, we're still gonna be there fighting Al-Qaeda.
[00:29:28.515 --> 00:29:29.775]  Fighting Al-Qaeda.
[00:29:30.495 --> 00:29:35.657]  Bush four years ago put out a press release at whitehouse.gov saying they're running three Al-Qaeda groups.
[00:29:36.886 --> 00:29:38.927]  Out of Iraq against Shiite Iran.
[00:29:38.947 --> 00:29:43.629]  I mean, Al-Qaeda on record works for our criminal so-called government.
[00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:49.011]  The people they're over there killing are political dissidents.
[00:29:49.051 --> 00:29:50.072]  That's who they're murdering.
[00:29:50.472 --> 00:29:51.372]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.853 --> 00:29:53.453]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.374 --> 00:29:57.075]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.639 --> 00:30:02.400]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[00:30:02.781 --> 00:30:06.303]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[00:30:06.583 --> 00:30:09.224]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[00:30:09.464 --> 00:30:14.387]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:14.827 --> 00:30:20.470]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.
[00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:26.113]  It's all fresh, made on a monthly basis, not some old cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[00:30:26.433 --> 00:30:30.715]  Try their new Evacuation Pack, a two-week supply of delicious, easy-to-fix food.
[00:30:30.976 --> 00:30:39.080]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it, with open talk of a strike on Iran in the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.
[00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:41.301]  Get yourself and your family ready today.
[00:30:41.662 --> 00:30:43.703]  The place to go is efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:44.043 --> 00:30:51.529]  Go to their website online right now, efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex, or call 800-409-5633.
[00:30:51.889 --> 00:30:56.632]  Again, on the web, efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex, or give them a call at 800-409-5633.
[00:31:03.843 --> 00:31:04.764]  Tyranny is here.
[00:31:05.104 --> 00:31:08.808]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:31:08.969 --> 00:31:11.251]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:31:11.271 --> 00:31:16.717]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:31:17.137 --> 00:31:23.364]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:31:23.784 --> 00:31:29.349]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:31:29.769 --> 00:31:33.452]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:31:33.953 --> 00:31:37.936]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:31:38.236 --> 00:31:43.761]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:31:44.181 --> 00:31:47.123]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:31:47.744 --> 00:31:49.145]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:31:49.725 --> 00:31:50.166]  It's here.

[00:32:01.377 --> 00:32:04.998]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:05.338 --> 00:32:13.460]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:32:14.201 --> 00:32:18.242]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:32:18.822 --> 00:32:29.645]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:32:30.265 --> 00:32:39.293]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:39.794 --> 00:32:44.858]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:32:45.219 --> 00:32:52.405]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:52.705 --> 00:32:55.127]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:12.452]  On the march, the empire is on the run.
[00:33:13.193 --> 00:33:16.875]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:23.129 --> 00:33:28.051]  is now publicly admitted to be a CIA NSA creation.
[00:33:28.372 --> 00:33:39.237]  But then the private individuals that run it, they get to then profit from the government protection they're given, the government seed money they were given to create Google.
[00:33:40.376 --> 00:33:53.043]  I was listening to MSNBC two days ago, and they were saying, why doesn't Google spend more money on the divisions that it has, like web search and advertising, that is making over 90% of its profit?
[00:33:53.424 --> 00:33:56.605]  Why is it branching out to take over every area of the web?
[00:33:57.006 --> 00:34:05.090]  And they said it's almost like, the analyst was saying, they're aggressively waging war on every other company, and wanting to dominate the web itself.
[00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:07.031]  Well, congratulations, you figured it out.
[00:34:07.652 --> 00:34:08.993]  Their stated goal
[00:34:09.793 --> 00:34:15.257]  is to take over the internet and to be the internet and then to be able to censor and control the web.
[00:34:16.458 --> 00:34:22.803]  Just like the Pentagon when they were ramming tanks and running over people and shooting people at Waco, they said, this is not an assault.
[00:34:24.785 --> 00:34:26.606]  And then people would come up with their hands up, they'd shoot them.
[00:34:27.227 --> 00:34:27.887]  That's on record.
[00:34:28.948 --> 00:34:29.648]  It's the same thing.
[00:34:29.929 --> 00:34:31.930]  Google's name, Don't Be Evil.
[00:34:32.511 --> 00:34:33.171]  It's slogan.
[00:34:33.211 --> 00:34:33.992]  It's the opposite.
[00:34:35.063 --> 00:34:36.724]  Now people say, well why do you use Google then?
[00:34:36.784 --> 00:34:37.725]  Why do you use YouTube?
[00:34:37.745 --> 00:34:38.986]  Because that's where the war is.
[00:34:39.427 --> 00:34:41.508]  To a great extent now, that's the internet.
[00:34:42.229 --> 00:34:43.090]  That's the web.
[00:34:43.971 --> 00:34:50.576]  Federal courts will rule for Google in cases when they're clearly violating people's copyright, doing whatever they want.
[00:34:51.137 --> 00:34:54.680]  But then separately, even other big companies, the courts will rule against.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:35:02.927]  It's just like Tyson Chicken has a global oligopoly, near monopoly, not just here but in Asia, over chicken.
[00:35:03.607 --> 00:35:09.971]  And they're allowed to have, in some cases, hundreds of times violations per packing plant that their competition is.
[00:35:10.552 --> 00:35:12.693]  Because they are the consolidator.
[00:35:13.034 --> 00:35:13.914]  They have been chosen.
[00:35:14.234 --> 00:35:15.095]  Same thing with BP.
[00:35:15.976 --> 00:35:25.202]  They have had more violations in Houston and Texas City alone in the last decade than all other oil company refinery violations combined.
[00:35:25.582 --> 00:35:30.606]  Because they are owned by the Dutch and British Royal Family, and they are the top echelon.
[00:35:31.286 --> 00:35:32.967]  They're funding the global carbon tax.
[00:35:33.407 --> 00:35:37.769]  They bullied the other oil companies in the last five years into accepting that.
[00:35:37.789 --> 00:35:39.970]  So it's a vertical integration.
[00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:44.651]  And we saw an amazing illustration of this yesterday.
[00:35:45.332 --> 00:35:46.092]  You did it again.
[00:35:46.152 --> 00:35:47.092]  We're 11 for 11.
[00:35:47.332 --> 00:35:51.574]  A couple times we've done two search terms, so we're actually 14 for 14.
[00:35:51.854 --> 00:35:57.176]  But we've long, but sometimes, we've done this 11 times, but a few times I've given out two search terms in one day.
[00:35:57.196 --> 00:35:57.817]  So technically we're 14
[00:35:59.779 --> 00:36:00.260]  For 14.
[00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:01.260]  I've counted them up.
[00:36:03.002 --> 00:36:04.643]  We're now 14 for 14.
[00:36:05.083 --> 00:36:20.395]  We put out two search terms yesterday, Kill Webb and Bombshell Barack, that link to articles that we've written about Barack Obama being a known CIA operative asset, literally from the time he was a child, his entire family on both sides.
[00:36:22.877 --> 00:36:24.678]  That became the number one search term.
[00:36:25.179 --> 00:36:27.981]  Literally hundreds of blogs and news sites reported on it.
[00:36:28.361 --> 00:36:29.002]  Big success.
[00:36:30.151 --> 00:36:35.681]  They didn't delist that as Google News, as the big aggregator.
[00:36:36.262 --> 00:36:39.908]  Those links were still available, though they did remove it as the number one search term.
[00:36:39.928 --> 00:36:40.790]  It became number one.
[00:36:42.112 --> 00:36:42.793]  Killweb!
[00:36:43.902 --> 00:36:56.974]  Was number two, then became number one, then got pushed to number three, then was totally erased, dealing with Google and its stated plans with Verizon and others to begin phasing out the open, free internet as we know it.
[00:36:57.795 --> 00:37:02.219]  Now, Killweb, for about ten minutes, when it was the top search term,
[00:37:03.519 --> 00:37:05.601]  was linked to our story.
[00:37:05.641 --> 00:37:18.033]  When people saw that term, the top link was the PrisonPlanet.com article by Paul Joseph Watson that had the headline, Google's Plan to Kill the Internet, Part of Consolidation of the Internet.
[00:37:19.014 --> 00:37:21.877]  Or Google's Plan to Kill the Web, Part of Consolidation of the Internet.
[00:37:23.278 --> 00:37:25.901]  They didn't just delist the term Kill Web.
[00:37:29.435 --> 00:37:38.197]  Suddenly the Wall Street Journal in live time came out with a blog with the term kill web separately that replaced it and they removed
[00:37:40.011 --> 00:37:44.875]  The PrisonPlanet.com article from searchability on Google News.
[00:37:44.935 --> 00:37:46.636]  We have never seen that.
[00:37:46.816 --> 00:37:54.863]  In live time, Google did not want you reading that article by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:37:54.903 --> 00:37:57.005]  We are effectively challenging the globalists.
[00:37:57.545 --> 00:37:58.886]  The listeners are our power.
[00:37:59.266 --> 00:38:00.387]  You're taking action.
[00:38:00.748 --> 00:38:05.351]  InfoWars and PrisonPlanet are rising stratospherically in their ratings.
[00:38:05.692 --> 00:38:08.254]  InfoWars now in the top 500 sites in the world.
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:14.562]  And if it continues to grow, it'll be in the top 100 within a year.
[00:38:15.563 --> 00:38:17.044]  A year after that, it'll be in the top 50.
[00:38:17.724 --> 00:38:19.245]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:38:19.545 --> 00:38:21.947]  This has got the system worried, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:21.967 --> 00:38:22.747]  They've hacked us.
[00:38:23.087 --> 00:38:24.028]  They've attacked us.
[00:38:24.088 --> 00:38:25.029]  They've harassed us.
[00:38:25.509 --> 00:38:29.371]  They've done things I don't even get into on air because that would feed into their operations.
[00:38:30.972 --> 00:38:37.897]  The point is, we're having a real effect, and that's why they've intensified their attacks, and they're only going to intensify them more.
[00:38:39.246 --> 00:38:48.074]  Now the video analysis that is 15 minutes long that goes along with the articles Paul Watson has written about this subject is at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:38:50.407 --> 00:38:50.687]  Get it.
[00:38:51.388 --> 00:38:51.808]  Share it.
[00:38:52.129 --> 00:38:52.749]  Burn it to disk.
[00:38:52.769 --> 00:38:53.530]  Give it to everyone you know.
[00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:59.956]  Because in 15 minutes we boil down the Google slash government Verizon takeover of the web that they're now attempting.
[00:39:00.337 --> 00:39:05.301]  And the name of the video is Google plans to kill web and internet takeover agenda.
[00:39:05.562 --> 00:39:10.366]  And I like to give these videos first to PrisonPlanet.tv members, but what we're going to do is...
[00:39:11.187 --> 00:39:17.969]  We are going to have it uploaded in the next hour to the Alex Jones channel at YouTube as well for viral spread.
[00:39:18.349 --> 00:39:19.129]  So please get it.
[00:39:19.729 --> 00:39:24.491]  When you get behind a video we can get tens of millions of views routinely over a half million.
[00:39:24.891 --> 00:39:29.912]  Another serious strike using their system to expose what's happening.
[00:39:29.932 --> 00:39:32.033]  Now the average Google worker is compartmentalized.
[00:39:32.213 --> 00:39:38.118]  It's like the average cop is good and is compartmentalized, or the average CPS worker is compartmentalized and isn't that bad.
[00:39:38.659 --> 00:39:44.564]  Just like the average person working for the CIA is compartmentalized, or the FBI.
[00:39:45.472 --> 00:39:51.635]  But there's no doubt Google's a government front, that's admitted, and there's no doubt it is not even running a business plan.
[00:39:51.675 --> 00:39:56.797]  It is running a full-spectrum dominance takeover of the web operation.
[00:39:57.297 --> 00:40:00.278]  So get the video from PrisonPlanet.tv, get it out to everyone.
[00:40:00.598 --> 00:40:03.960]  Google plans to kill web and internet takeover agenda.
[00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:07.381]  That's the name of the video and the name of the censored article.
[00:40:08.301 --> 00:40:11.463]  And great job to everybody making both those search terms number one.
[00:40:11.763 --> 00:40:14.444]  Now I want to get into economic news, but I want to get into this first.
[00:40:15.717 --> 00:40:25.067]  Yesterday I noticed that organically the number three and number six search terms, when I happened to look at it, were Bilderberg Group and Bilderberg Club.
[00:40:25.668 --> 00:40:34.977]  Because Fidel Castro read Daniel Estelin's book, which is excellent, Club Bilderberg, or the Bilderberg Club.
[00:40:36.583 --> 00:40:41.725]  And talked about how, yes, there's this global group of elitists running the planet.
[00:40:42.426 --> 00:40:54.091]  I noticed Fidel didn't talk about the fact that communists in China and Russia, to a full extent, funded the communist operation to create a false bipolar enemy to fight against.
[00:40:55.071 --> 00:40:56.972]  I agree with Joel Skousen yesterday.
[00:40:57.292 --> 00:40:58.772]  They didn't run the Soviets.
[00:40:59.192 --> 00:41:00.653]  They didn't run the Nazis.
[00:41:01.073 --> 00:41:10.936]  It's on record they created them and funded them as an enemy they could then destroy and had intelligence operatives from their founding throughout their hierarchies.
[00:41:12.296 --> 00:41:14.717]  So that they always had an intelligence upper hand.
[00:41:15.657 --> 00:41:18.039]  But the leadership they didn't control, the very top leadership.
[00:41:18.299 --> 00:41:19.039]  I mean, here's an example.
[00:41:19.059 --> 00:41:20.661]  Saddam Hussein, 1958.
[00:41:21.962 --> 00:41:23.363]  He's 18 years old.
[00:41:24.103 --> 00:41:30.428]  It's declassified, you know, mainstream Washington Post, that he was hired and trained for four years in Egypt by the CIA.
[00:41:30.848 --> 00:41:32.669]  He was sent in to commit assassinations.
[00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:41.556]  A decade later, they were so scared of the teams he was leading that the US and England said, make Saddam Hussein the head of Baathist security.
[00:41:42.276 --> 00:41:43.679]  And we will stop killing your leaders.
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:47.929]  They made him the head of Baathist security in 69, no 68, and then in 1979 he staged a coup.
[00:41:52.481 --> 00:41:53.682]  and became the Ba'athist leader.
[00:41:53.962 --> 00:41:57.605]  Then they gave him $35 to $40 billion to launch an attack on Iran.
[00:41:57.925 --> 00:41:59.366]  Then they double-crossed him.
[00:41:59.887 --> 00:42:07.813]  But once they double-crossed him, almost all of his officer corps had been trained for decades in the United States, on record.
[00:42:08.413 --> 00:42:15.819]  That's why when the 1991 war ended, 5,000-plus Iraqi officers were brought back to the U.S., L.A.
[00:42:15.859 --> 00:42:16.960]  Times, Washington Post.
[00:42:17.662 --> 00:42:21.444]  Because they had been trained previously here.
[00:42:21.744 --> 00:42:24.166]  Now they're used for black-op terror attacks.
[00:42:24.186 --> 00:42:25.326]  They're a sabotage army.
[00:42:25.626 --> 00:42:26.607]  The government can use it.
[00:42:27.047 --> 00:42:28.328]  They'll burn a couple of them.
[00:42:29.148 --> 00:42:32.790]  The leadership understands they'll burn some of their underlings if they ever launch that terror attack.
[00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:39.694]  But that's a secret brigade, or above-brigade strength, Iraqi terror force that we've identified inside the U.S.
[00:42:39.714 --> 00:42:42.335]  that does not work for Saddam Hussein.
[00:42:42.715 --> 00:42:44.136]  He's dead, as you know, at the end of a rope.
[00:42:44.596 --> 00:42:47.138]  It works for the CIA that created them.
[00:42:48.271 --> 00:42:54.502]  But you notice that Fidel Castro didn't talk about that in his article he wrote.
[00:42:55.805 --> 00:43:00.293]  But the fact is that he's elevated it even more.
[00:43:01.581 --> 00:43:14.431]  We've gone from ten years ago, no one, maybe one out of a hundred know what the Bilderberg Group is, to the vast majority of people knowing about shadow government, world government, Bilderberg Group, the New York Times, the Financial Times of London.
[00:43:14.792 --> 00:43:23.459]  They've gone from denying it existed when Jim Tucker was exposing it 34 years ago, and Westbrook Pegler, 60 years ago, wrote two stories about it.
[00:43:24.239 --> 00:43:25.440]  He didn't even know the name of it then.
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:26.381]  Then he died.
[00:43:26.441 --> 00:43:27.362]  Tucker picked up on it.
[00:43:28.559 --> 00:43:38.304]  Now they admit it's real and admit they want world government, but say it's a good idea to have the bankers run a world government and you'll pay all your environmental and carbon taxes to them.
[00:43:39.404 --> 00:43:47.008]  So we've done an article here at PrisonPlanet.com that just launched in the last 20 minutes that is so incredibly important.
[00:43:47.028 --> 00:43:51.350]  We're going to get it posted up on InfoWars.com as well.
[00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:54.592]  This is going to be the top story throughout the weekend.
[00:43:56.465 --> 00:43:58.686]  Two films that blew Bilderberg wide open.
[00:43:59.526 --> 00:44:00.686]  Most people aren't going to read.
[00:44:00.706 --> 00:44:06.547]  They're not even going to read the Financial Times of London with the Bilderberg group admitting they're authoritarian and taking over for our own good.
[00:44:06.788 --> 00:44:10.248]  But they will watch in-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:44:10.268 --> 00:44:18.610]  They will watch the Obama deception and see Obama meeting secretly with Hillary at the Bilderberg meeting while the media had been told he'd gone somewhere else.
[00:44:19.231 --> 00:44:22.431]  And that's just a small part of the film, but very close to the start.
[00:44:22.852 --> 00:44:24.252]  And it exposes their full agenda.
[00:44:24.972 --> 00:44:27.196]  You get these two films to people and they're free.
[00:44:27.236 --> 00:44:28.218]  Did I mention they're free?
[00:44:28.458 --> 00:44:30.341]  Yes, I sell the DVDs of Endgame.
[00:44:30.621 --> 00:44:32.485]  I sell the DVDs of Obama Deception.
[00:44:32.505 --> 00:44:35.049]  We have it in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:44:36.823 --> 00:44:39.984]  But my goal here is not to make money.
[00:44:40.404 --> 00:44:49.646]  As long as we can fund our operation, which we're doing okay at, probably going to have a money bomb soon to get past some shortages, underages we've had, because we need to expand, we can keep going where we're at.
[00:44:49.666 --> 00:44:51.227]  We've got to grow in the face of the enemy.
[00:44:51.647 --> 00:44:52.807]  We've got to intensify.
[00:44:52.987 --> 00:44:53.688]  We've got to adapt.
[00:44:53.708 --> 00:44:54.588]  We've got to overcome.
[00:44:55.048 --> 00:45:02.470]  But getting back to what I'm saying, if we make this the number one search term, I'm not going to do another search term for a few weeks, I think.
[00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:03.870]  I'm going to lay off of it for a while.
[00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:05.971]  But I want this to be our biggest ever.
[00:45:07.071 --> 00:45:08.632]  Our biggest ever.
[00:45:12.115 --> 00:45:17.439]  I want to search the term Bilderberg films.
[00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:19.281]  Bilderberg films.
[00:45:19.861 --> 00:45:21.082]  Bilderberg films.
[00:45:22.048 --> 00:45:23.710]  And I want you to send this link out.
[00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:28.916]  That also drives it up and ensures that this article's at the top when people click on the term Bilderberg Films.
[00:45:29.356 --> 00:45:33.160]  And that will lead them to two films that blew Bilderberg wide open.
[00:45:33.481 --> 00:45:38.747]  Fidel Castro's spotlight on the Bilderberg click is part of a global awakening to the New World Order.
[00:45:40.455 --> 00:45:54.581]  And when they go to this article, they will get the full spectrum of Bilderberg and what its plans are for world government, simply and concisely, with links to all their admissions, and two well-produced, high-quality, full-length films.
[00:45:55.722 --> 00:46:05.186]  So send this article to all these people, now discovering what Bilderberg is, now finding out there really is a world government, there really are these private cliques running all of this.
[00:46:06.604 --> 00:46:15.133]  See, just because for us old-timers that have been doing this 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50 years, some of you, you feel like you've told everybody, you've been laughed at.
[00:46:15.774 --> 00:46:27.406]  Now's the time to tell people again and to tell them with 10 times the effort and focus because now is the time.
[00:46:27.767 --> 00:46:28.628]  We are having
[00:46:31.255 --> 00:46:33.096]  A giant effect right now.
[00:46:33.536 --> 00:46:42.318]  We are having a huge sustained effect right now and the people are now ready to hear this information.
[00:46:42.998 --> 00:46:47.900]  And this is in Time Magazine, AP, Reuters, Baltimore Sun.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.480]  What is Fidel Castro reading?
[00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:54.902]  So people are out looking around to find out what the Bilderberg Group is right now.
[00:46:55.402 --> 00:46:57.662]  This is a key term to search.
[00:46:57.822 --> 00:46:59.323]  Bilderberg Films.
[00:46:59.983 --> 00:47:01.203]  Bilderberg Films.
[00:47:01.524 --> 00:47:26.132]  And you can write on your own website or blog or news site articles about Bilderberg Films, get traffic to your site, put your perspective on Bilderberg, and then post the two videos we've got linked there in the article in full from YouTube, from the director channel, change the channel, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, almost three hours long, and just under two hours, The Obama Deception.
[00:47:26.837 --> 00:47:31.540]  The Obama deception has had 7 million views on one channel alone.
[00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:40.664]  It's approaching 30 million views on YouTube, Google, Blip.TV, and the file sharing networks, just the numbers we can see.
[00:47:40.684 --> 00:47:43.186]  30 million views in a year and a half.
[00:47:44.468 --> 00:47:53.795]  That is a devastating effect on the enemy because it's not Obama being politically exposed and politically destroyed as a liberal because then they'll just put in a fake Republican.
[00:47:54.055 --> 00:48:10.548]  It's exposing the entire paradigm and how the Bilderberg Group and other globalist interlocking systems of mafia, that's what it is, this is mafia, organized corporate mafia, have taken over our society and we can really accelerate the awakening that's happening now.
[00:48:10.588 --> 00:48:13.470]  So I want you to search the term and we'll be 15 for 15.
[00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:14.191]  I commend you.
[00:48:16.206 --> 00:48:17.347]  Two words together.
[00:48:17.787 --> 00:48:19.629]  Bilderberg Films.
[00:48:20.269 --> 00:48:22.951]  Films with an S. Bilderberg Films.
[00:48:23.571 --> 00:48:24.993]  Bilderberg Films.
[00:48:25.633 --> 00:48:29.056]  And that will lead you to this.
[00:48:30.096 --> 00:48:32.478]  You could also do a secondary search if they try to stop it.
[00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:36.701]  Bilderberg Wide Open.
[00:48:37.422 --> 00:48:39.984]  Bilderberg Wide Open.
[00:48:41.861 --> 00:48:47.525]  You could also do it this way, you know, because they try to erase these after they're up a few hours, but the damage to them is already done.
[00:48:48.166 --> 00:48:51.668]  The key search is Bilderberg Films.
[00:48:51.728 --> 00:48:52.529]  That's number one.
[00:48:52.849 --> 00:48:55.912]  Then Bilderberg Wide Open is another search you can do.
[00:48:56.412 --> 00:48:58.574]  And then you can also just search Two Films.
[00:48:59.855 --> 00:49:01.756]  The words Two Films.
[00:49:02.396 --> 00:49:02.877]  If you choose.
[00:49:02.897 --> 00:49:05.619]  Let's see if we can have number one, number two and number three.
[00:49:06.359 --> 00:49:07.840]  Search the term Two Films.
[00:49:08.885 --> 00:49:11.309]  T-W-O-F-I-L-M-S.
[00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:14.273]  Search the term Bilderberg Films.
[00:49:14.313 --> 00:49:16.216]  That's most important as a search term.
[00:49:16.256 --> 00:49:17.117]  Bilderberg Films.
[00:49:17.638 --> 00:49:19.140]  And Bilderberg Wide Open.
[00:49:19.861 --> 00:49:21.103]  Bilderberg Wide Open.
[00:49:21.664 --> 00:49:22.745]  Bilderberg Wide Open.
[00:49:24.704 --> 00:49:26.846]  Bilderberg films and two films.
[00:49:27.526 --> 00:49:34.933]  And that will lead everyone to this article where Endgame and the Obama deception are posted in full.
[00:49:34.973 --> 00:49:39.697]  In fact, put that back up on screen, please, for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, and we'll scroll down through the article.
[00:49:39.717 --> 00:49:47.684]  They will learn all about its history, their eugenics plans, their master operation, how they gave the green light to start the propaganda to attack Iran.
[00:49:47.944 --> 00:49:49.165]  We told you that three months ago.
[00:49:49.225 --> 00:49:51.067]  Now look at how the propaganda has intensified.
[00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:56.432]  This one article is a treasure trove of key information.
[00:49:58.253 --> 00:50:04.475]  And we can educate millions of people today, every day, striking serious blows.
[00:50:04.715 --> 00:50:06.376]  And we're not going to defeat the globalists overnight.
[00:50:06.696 --> 00:50:07.337]  It takes time.
[00:50:07.597 --> 00:50:14.500]  But it takes the determined spirit of understanding how the internet works, where most people get their news and information now, and using the web while we've still got it.
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:21.443]  The global engineers are moving to start shutting down the web as we know it, curtailing it, censoring it, taxing it, regulating it.
[00:50:22.657 --> 00:50:27.339]  Shutting many areas of it down because they know, we know, of their criminal activities.
[00:50:27.639 --> 00:50:37.083]  And every time they put out ridiculous propaganda, like combat operations are over, seven years ago with Bush, and now this week with Obama, we're going to expose that.
[00:50:37.363 --> 00:50:40.645]  We're going to expose the massive seizures and deaths from the vaccines.
[00:50:40.905 --> 00:50:42.266]  We're going to expose aspartame.
[00:50:42.486 --> 00:50:43.966]  We're going to expose the CPS.
[00:50:44.226 --> 00:50:45.647]  We're going to expose the police state.
[00:50:46.007 --> 00:50:49.429]  So search the term Bilderberg films with an S.
[00:50:50.129 --> 00:50:50.769]  God bless you.
[00:50:50.809 --> 00:50:51.390]  You're awesome.
[00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:52.590]  Financial news on your call.
[00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:53.071]  Straight ahead.
[00:50:53.091 --> 00:50:53.871]  Stay with us.
[00:51:02.396 --> 00:51:03.517]  This is not a drill.
[00:51:03.597 --> 00:51:05.538]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:51:07.998 --> 00:51:15.122]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[00:51:15.222 --> 00:51:19.584]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[00:51:19.624 --> 00:51:29.949]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[00:51:30.609 --> 00:51:31.669]  Any circumstance.
[00:51:31.749 --> 00:51:38.631]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[00:51:38.971 --> 00:51:39.632]  But listen up.
[00:51:39.672 --> 00:51:45.853]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[00:51:45.913 --> 00:51:47.714]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[00:51:47.754 --> 00:51:49.834]  That's hideyourguns.com.
[00:51:49.914 --> 00:51:50.395]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:51:50.415 --> 00:51:52.255]  Before they come for your guns.
[00:51:52.295 --> 00:51:52.975]  Hideyourguns.com right now.
[00:52:00.188 --> 00:52:02.510]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:02.570 --> 00:52:04.773]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:04.793 --> 00:52:07.655]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:08.116 --> 00:52:12.860]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:13.221 --> 00:52:17.405]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:17.725 --> 00:52:20.046]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:20.066 --> 00:52:22.607]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:22.947 --> 00:52:25.528]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:25.869 --> 00:52:33.472]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:33.809 --> 00:52:39.073]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:39.193 --> 00:52:41.475]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:41.515 --> 00:52:45.478]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:45.738 --> 00:52:46.658]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:46.798 --> 00:52:48.119]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:48.159 --> 00:52:49.140]  Invisible Empire.

[00:52:59.446 --> 00:52:59.906]  Attention!
[00:53:00.046 --> 00:53:04.948]  This is a special alert to all Americans who owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS.
[00:53:05.048 --> 00:53:10.570]  The IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from people who owe back taxes and dramatically lowering amounts owed.
[00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:17.672]  Due to the financial crisis in America, the IRS has announced a leniency plan in recognition of consumers' financial troubles in today's economy.
[00:53:17.873 --> 00:53:26.616]  If you owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, an open phone line has been established by American Tax Settlement for you to call and see if you qualify for a reduction by up to 75%.
[00:53:27.836 --> 00:53:30.157]  Number to call is 800-902-6969.
[00:53:30.977 --> 00:53:37.618]  Again, the IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from consumers who owe back taxes in response to the decline in today's economy.
[00:53:37.818 --> 00:53:46.620]  If you are struggling with $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, you now may be eligible for a dramatic reduction by up to 75% and save thousands of dollars.
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:51.361]  For free information and to see if you qualify, call the open phone line into American Tax Settlement now.
[00:53:51.561 --> 00:53:51.621]  800-902-6969.
[00:53:51.641 --> 00:53:51.701]  800-902-6969.
[00:53:51.721 --> 00:53:51.961]  Again, 800-902-6969.
[00:53:52.081 --> 00:53:53.723]  I read the news today, oh boy.
[00:53:53.783 --> 00:53:55.604]  Ah, our troops have just left Iraq.
[00:53:55.644 --> 00:53:56.345]  About a lucky man.
[00:53:56.425 --> 00:53:57.365]  But they didn't leave.
[00:53:57.405 --> 00:54:07.613]  Just like they didn't leave seven years ago when Bush said it.
[00:54:22.182 --> 00:54:24.363]  They love throwing propaganda in our face.
[00:54:26.483 --> 00:54:31.305]  And after the hoax of their swine flu shot last year, they're back with it again.
[00:54:31.325 --> 00:54:34.446]  It's incredible.
[00:54:34.866 --> 00:54:35.546]  Look at this news.
[00:54:35.886 --> 00:54:38.087]  People have huge disbelief in government.
[00:54:38.447 --> 00:54:46.890]  That CNBC poll show that at all-time high, or more than two-thirds of people believe nothing the government says.
[00:54:49.602 --> 00:54:54.106]  Continuing here, social security cuts weighed by panel, Wall Street Journal.
[00:54:54.126 --> 00:54:55.047]  I'm going to be covering that.
[00:54:56.008 --> 00:54:58.930]  But first, when we start the second hour, I'm going to take a bunch of your calls.
[00:54:59.491 --> 00:55:01.753]  Alex, Vernon, Nate, Tom, Daniel, and others that are holding.
[00:55:02.093 --> 00:55:05.716]  But I briefly wanted to bring Ted Anderson up because I forgot to have him on yesterday.
[00:55:06.537 --> 00:55:10.619]  And Ted, in the last three weeks, bought a bunch of gold and silver when it was down by fifty bucks.
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:16.843]  It's now up over fifty bucks from where it was, and he's about to sell out at the low prices.
[00:55:17.123 --> 00:55:21.205]  Again, he buys it when it's low, sells it to you when it's high, at the old low price.
[00:55:21.245 --> 00:55:23.847]  That's called capitalism and competition.
[00:55:24.247 --> 00:55:29.910]  Franks, sovereigns, buffaloes, American eagles, silver, they've got it all.
[00:55:30.210 --> 00:55:34.092]  Ted, briefly, you called me last night, you said, you know, we didn't do a plug
[00:55:35.573 --> 00:55:37.394]  Today, but things have been so crazy here.
[00:55:37.635 --> 00:55:42.438]  We're running out quick, but I'm going to do one more offer, but we're going to be out of this soon.
[00:55:42.478 --> 00:55:45.099]  But even if we run out at that price, I'll eat it.
[00:55:45.499 --> 00:55:50.062]  But you said you're going to hold this through Sunday evening and brokers will be there throughout the weekend.
[00:55:50.402 --> 00:55:52.564]  Tell folks the offer you've got for them today, Ted.
[00:55:52.904 --> 00:55:53.725]  Well, yeah, sure.
[00:55:53.765 --> 00:55:59.071]  I mean, currently right now, if you go to the internet pricing, it's at $271.84 for a franc.
[00:55:59.171 --> 00:56:04.557]  And presently, right now, I have the same coin at $265 for this radio offer.
[00:56:04.958 --> 00:56:07.100]  Gold has gone up like crazy, like you've said.
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:10.184]  The British sovereign right now, I have him at $333.
[00:56:12.546 --> 00:56:19.716]  And 86 cents, and currently right now on the internet they've already gone over 340 and 37 cents.
[00:56:19.736 --> 00:56:22.219]  So the prices are up significantly.
[00:56:22.239 --> 00:56:25.103]  The economic news out there is dismal.
[00:56:25.503 --> 00:56:28.567]  And I just need to say, Alex, people need to get moving on this.
[00:56:29.268 --> 00:56:30.629]  We are heading into the fall.
[00:56:30.689 --> 00:56:31.889]  Gold is going upward.
[00:56:32.189 --> 00:56:42.853]  These British sovereigns and Franks and, like you said, the Buffalos, the Eagles, the junk silver, the banks of pre-1964, everything's moving up in price.
[00:56:43.253 --> 00:56:46.154]  And that's because of the fact that the dollar is going to be hit.
[00:56:46.514 --> 00:56:49.055]  The Asians are getting out of the United States dollar.
[00:56:49.075 --> 00:56:50.056]  They're going to gold.
[00:56:50.736 --> 00:56:56.118]  We know that we're going to see inflation because the government's resorting to printing press to solve, et cetera,
[00:56:56.338 --> 00:57:04.263]  And the fall is always when gold runs up the most, so they can try some manipulation in the interim, but all the charts show clearly up, up, up and away.
[00:57:04.664 --> 00:57:07.125]  Tell folks the coins you've got, give them the toll-free number.
[00:57:07.345 --> 00:57:09.267]  Yeah, right now, definitely the franc.
[00:57:09.487 --> 00:57:11.368]  There's no question about it, that's the deal.
[00:57:11.548 --> 00:57:13.109]  Right now, it is sitting at $265 apiece.
[00:57:13.129 --> 00:57:13.810]  You can call us at 800-686-2237.
[00:57:27.379 --> 00:57:29.359]  2237, ask for the Frank or the British Sovereign.
[00:57:29.659 --> 00:57:32.741]  Both of those are steeply discounted in the marketplace right now.
[00:57:33.081 --> 00:57:43.845]  And if you move at this moment, and they will go up after Sunday, but if you move right now at this moment, you will get that full year subscription to the International Forecaster when you buy that Frank.
[00:57:43.925 --> 00:57:48.087]  And you know, that brings the price of gold down to less than $500 an ounce.
[00:57:48.767 --> 00:57:49.868]  Alex, it's a good buy.
[00:57:49.888 --> 00:57:52.249]  I would really recommend that people get moving.
[00:57:52.449 --> 00:57:52.489]  800-686-2237.
[00:57:52.509 --> 00:57:54.091]  800-686-2237 is the toll-free number for folks to call.
[00:57:54.111 --> 00:57:55.754]  Again, it's on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:57:55.774 --> 00:57:55.814]  800-686-2237.
[00:58:08.192 --> 00:58:09.073]  Thank you, Ted Anderson.
[00:58:37.591 --> 00:58:39.154]  Yeah, thanks Alex.

[01:00:04.881 --> 01:00:09.064]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.705 --> 01:00:10.505]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.306 --> 01:00:12.227]  Well, so does he.

[01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:21.094]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.322 --> 01:00:33.964]  Well, in Europe and the United States, the media is hyping you've got to get your flu shot again for H1N1 or you'll be hurt.
[01:00:34.505 --> 01:00:39.747]  They admit it causes tenfold increase in seizures and brain damage and Guillain-Barré, but so what?
[01:00:39.787 --> 01:00:40.387]  It's good for you.
[01:00:40.787 --> 01:00:46.610]  We'll be talking about that, all the Bilderberg information in the news, a bunch of financial news, military news.
[01:00:47.490 --> 01:00:52.032]  It's all coming up in this hour, but let's start getting to your phone calls right now.
[01:00:52.473 --> 01:00:54.313]  Let's talk to Alex in California.
[01:00:54.413 --> 01:00:55.314]  Alex, you're on the air.
[01:00:56.946 --> 01:00:57.286]  How are you doing?
[01:00:57.326 --> 01:00:58.347]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:00:58.467 --> 01:00:59.948]  I'm a Prison Planet subscriber.
[01:01:00.349 --> 01:01:03.471]  Listen, my article was featuring your movie, Police Day 4.
[01:01:03.671 --> 01:01:07.153]  It was when you were talking about the article about the Marines doing checkpoints here.
[01:01:07.173 --> 01:01:13.098]  If you would allow me just to explain that, go over what happened eventually, and then a couple other things I wanted to mention.
[01:01:13.178 --> 01:01:15.099]  Are you the newspaper reporter that interviewed me?
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:17.221]  Yes, that's me.
[01:01:17.301 --> 01:01:18.782]  I'm a freelance reporter from Los Angeles.
[01:01:19.502 --> 01:01:22.263]  Yeah, but that was for a major newspaper that you wrote that for.
[01:01:22.283 --> 01:01:27.946]  I don't remember the name, but we had the press releases about the Marines running drunk driving checkpoints.
[01:01:27.966 --> 01:01:28.746]  Yeah, tell us about it.
[01:01:29.767 --> 01:01:33.609]  Right, okay, so what happened was, this happened in December 2008, the actual incident.
[01:01:34.029 --> 01:01:42.333]  I reported on it in early 2009, and it was for the Inland Empire Weekly, which is a, you know, weekly newspaper out in the Inland Empire, which is a part of Southern California, just outside of L.A.
[01:01:43.253 --> 01:01:48.796]  So, basically what happened was, I confirmed by the gunnery sergeant at the Marine base that
[01:01:49.238 --> 01:01:50.338]  Military police were there.
[01:01:50.358 --> 01:01:51.379]  There was even a photo of it.
[01:01:52.019 --> 01:02:00.482]  I never got a hold of the person who was arrested, although I know that they did arrest at least one person, and I never got a hold of the attorney that I spoke to that was involved.
[01:02:00.882 --> 01:02:04.343]  But I also have an email that one of the gunnery sergeants sent me.
[01:02:04.903 --> 01:02:10.945]  It was from February of last year, where he was actually transferred to Japan after, you know, I was trying to contact him for a month.
[01:02:11.186 --> 01:02:12.286]  It's Gunnery Sergeant Chris Cox.
[01:02:13.135 --> 01:02:17.917]  He sent me an email from February of 2009, basically saying that he was no longer in the country.
[01:02:17.957 --> 01:02:18.518]  He got trapped.
[01:02:18.538 --> 01:02:31.424]  Well, what's happening is, from Tennessee to California to Florida to Texas, Michigan, you name it, they have regular Army and Marines actually arresting citizens everywhere, and they just do it to see if they can get away with it.
[01:02:31.744 --> 01:02:37.667]  And when the governor said don't do it last year in Tennessee, they just went ahead and did it anyway, shutting down highways.
[01:02:38.127 --> 01:02:40.929]  I mean, this is the takeover of this country.
[01:02:42.185 --> 01:02:42.646]  Right, right.
[01:02:42.666 --> 01:02:44.468]  I just want to thank you guys for putting my article up there.
[01:02:44.488 --> 01:02:46.230]  I got a lot of people getting a hold of me.
[01:02:46.270 --> 01:02:46.991]  Couldn't believe it.
[01:02:47.311 --> 01:02:48.112]  It's a true story.
[01:02:48.732 --> 01:02:50.014]  But also, you know, I'm from the L.A.
[01:02:50.094 --> 01:02:50.294]  area.
[01:02:50.314 --> 01:02:51.936]  I wanted to talk about a local case here.
[01:02:52.196 --> 01:02:54.739]  It goes into, you know, the torture sites.
[01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:57.583]  It came on the Daily Breeze yesterday in the Los Angeles area.
[01:02:57.943 --> 01:03:00.946]  It's about a man who basically is a Muslim, a U.S.
[01:03:00.966 --> 01:03:01.347]  citizen.
[01:03:01.795 --> 01:03:02.736]  He claims he was tortured.
[01:03:02.756 --> 01:03:04.417]  The ACLU is actually trying to sue the government.
[01:03:04.437 --> 01:03:07.439]  If I could just read the first paragraph, it'll give you a good idea of what the state of Arkansas says.
[01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:12.083]  Oh, they're arresting citizens all the time and torturing them and not giving them the habeas corpus due process.
[01:03:12.103 --> 01:03:12.463]  Go ahead.
[01:03:13.404 --> 01:03:14.745]  Okay, it's from the Daily Breeze.
[01:03:14.805 --> 01:03:26.074]  It says, a former Hawthorne resident says he was arrested for no reason in the United Arab Emirates, blindfolded, beaten, strapped to an electric chair, and told that his wife would be raped if he didn't confess to vague charges of terrorism.
[01:03:26.615 --> 01:03:28.276]  Now, and then it says his name and his brother,
[01:03:28.857 --> 01:03:33.599]  Uh, want answers from the United States government, which they say, which they allege played a role in the 13-month ordeal.
[01:03:33.879 --> 01:03:37.640]  They're basically having the ACLU out here, uh, trying to get some records from the government.
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:43.482]  Oh, by the way, the Washington Post admitted in 2002 they do torture people's children and wives in front of them.
[01:03:43.522 --> 01:03:45.123]  That's what the good guys do.
[01:03:45.703 --> 01:03:53.046]  And if people think that the globalists don't want to do this to citizens, or do it to the American people, almost all their training is for us.
[01:03:53.086 --> 01:03:53.446]  Go ahead.
[01:03:54.602 --> 01:03:55.464]  I think so.
[01:04:09.434 --> 01:04:21.701]  Wolf Blitzer, basically in one minute, Wolf Blitzer was parading the fact that the war was over, but in the same segment he was talking about how there's still going to be 50,000 troops there, and they made a big deal about how it's going to be a business boom for private security forces.
[01:04:21.721 --> 01:04:30.346]  No, no, I have the AP with the government admitting they're going to increase the security forces, the private mercs, but this is what they do.
[01:04:30.847 --> 01:04:37.611]  They cap the oil well 90-something days in, there's fissures everywhere, it's still leaking, and they just say, there's no more oil.
[01:04:38.331 --> 01:04:39.152]  Problem solved.
[01:04:39.192 --> 01:04:39.853]  It's not true.
[01:04:40.253 --> 01:04:42.215]  Obama says core exits good for you.
[01:04:42.956 --> 01:04:44.077]  There's no health problems.
[01:04:44.517 --> 01:04:45.719]  There's no world government.
[01:04:46.159 --> 01:04:47.561]  Flu shots aren't hurting you.
[01:04:48.602 --> 01:04:52.726]  Even though it's all admitted, they just use the military tactic of denial.
[01:04:53.026 --> 01:04:53.887]  We're their enemy.
[01:04:54.187 --> 01:04:55.449]  They're the offshore bankers.
[01:04:55.749 --> 01:04:56.730]  They hate America.
[01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:57.771]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:58.212 --> 01:04:58.912]  Good call, Alex.
[01:04:59.853 --> 01:05:04.095]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:04.416 --> 01:05:05.016]  Number one.
[01:05:05.316 --> 01:05:08.478]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:09.318]  Number two.
[01:05:09.598 --> 01:05:14.081]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:14.421 --> 01:05:14.881]  It's true.
[01:05:15.181 --> 01:05:19.724]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:20.044 --> 01:05:20.604]  Number three.
[01:05:20.864 --> 01:05:24.146]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:24.446 --> 01:05:28.148]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:28.348 --> 01:05:28.909]  Number 4.
[01:05:29.149 --> 01:05:31.511]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:31.911 --> 01:05:35.294]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:35.594 --> 01:05:36.135]  Number 5.
[01:05:36.395 --> 01:05:40.298]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:40.539 --> 01:05:45.303]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:06:03.790 --> 01:06:09.834]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:06:10.194 --> 01:06:17.298]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, air, laundry, and dishes.
[01:06:17.578 --> 01:06:22.121]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:06:35.374 --> 01:06:41.540]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:45.564]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[01:07:52.932 --> 01:07:55.493]  H-O-M-E G-A-I-N.com.
[01:07:55.814 --> 01:07:56.574]  Check them out today.
[01:07:59.125 --> 01:08:07.131]  Voters are fed up with our lawmakers' inability to take action when it comes to reducing this country's $1.5 trillion federal deficit.
[01:08:07.811 --> 01:08:15.777]  As the Wall Street Journal reports, it's the voters who appear to be more willing to take drastic steps to do something about the nation's mounting red ink.
[01:08:16.377 --> 01:08:21.904]  The newspaper talked to voters in Virginia, a swing state, who say they're willing to make the tough cuts.
[01:08:22.345 --> 01:08:27.811]  From a national sales tax, to budget cuts, to higher Medicare co-pays and deductibles.
[01:08:28.332 --> 01:08:31.196]  The voters get it, even if the federal government doesn't.
[01:08:31.816 --> 01:08:33.438]  And Washington really doesn't get it.
[01:08:34.059 --> 01:08:40.902]  Our leaders worry about being attacked in an election year if they even suggest spending cuts or tax increases.
[01:08:41.402 --> 01:08:44.404]  The American people just want their leaders to lead on this issue.
[01:08:44.604 --> 01:08:45.464]  Too much to ask?
[01:08:45.504 --> 01:08:47.125]  That's why they were elected, remember?
[01:08:47.845 --> 01:08:51.107]  One independent voter in Richmond, Virginia, told the Journal, quote here,
[01:08:51.887 --> 01:08:55.668]  I wish the politicians would be hard asses and be like, you know what?
[01:08:56.009 --> 01:09:00.150]  It's going to be horrible for the next few years, but you've got to shut up, unquote.
[01:09:00.690 --> 01:09:01.831]  Wouldn't that be refreshing?
[01:09:02.331 --> 01:09:08.073]  Meanwhile, we await the results of President Obama's bipartisan deficit reduction commission.
[01:09:08.834 --> 01:09:12.479]  Which are conveniently scheduled for release after the November election.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:18.948]  And when the recommendations finally do come, most if not all of them will have to be approved by Congress.
[01:09:19.489 --> 01:09:22.954]  Which will likely render the entire exercise meaningless.
[01:09:23.835 --> 01:09:28.297]  Some are suggesting a popular uprising is perhaps the only way to get this country back on track.
[01:09:28.597 --> 01:09:34.419]  There's a piece on Infowars.com suggesting without a revolution, Americans are history.
[01:09:34.999 --> 01:09:35.980]  Here's the question then.
[01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:40.862]  If voters want the deficits addressed, why does Washington continue to ignore them?
[01:09:41.542 --> 01:09:45.864]  Go to CNN.com slash Cafferty file and post a comment on my blog.
[01:09:47.044 --> 01:09:48.585]  Jack Cafferty, thanks very much.
[01:09:55.217 --> 01:09:55.978]  Big Brother.
[01:09:57.319 --> 01:09:58.961]  Mainstream media.
[01:10:00.102 --> 01:10:01.223]  Government cover-ups.
[01:10:02.645 --> 01:10:03.666]  You want answers?
[01:10:04.627 --> 01:10:05.608]  Well, so does he.
[01:10:06.548 --> 01:10:12.855]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:10:14.682 --> 01:10:20.824]  We are back live, going to your phone calls and a ton of vital news here in the second hour on this live Friday edition.
[01:10:21.285 --> 01:10:26.847]  A couple days ago, Cafferty of CNN blogged InfoWars.com.
[01:10:26.887 --> 01:10:29.628]  I didn't really know what to make of that, so I analyzed it.
[01:10:30.168 --> 01:10:45.968]  And of course he was quoting a Dr. Paul Craig Roberts article that went mega viral on the web, dealing with the fact, well the actual headline was, the ecstasy of empire, and the article ended with, if Americans don't have a revolution, Americans are finished.
[01:10:47.517 --> 01:10:51.798]  You know, I don't call for a physical revolution here, and we had Dr. Roberts on that day.
[01:10:51.858 --> 01:10:53.439]  He's not calling for that either.
[01:10:53.479 --> 01:11:00.762]  He's just saying that if we don't somehow, revolution means change, get back to our Constitution and Bill of Rights, it's over.
[01:11:01.722 --> 01:11:09.164]  But I think CNN went with that piece to make it look like popular sentiment for revolution would be tax increases.
[01:11:09.725 --> 01:11:11.145]  That's not what the American people want.
[01:11:11.465 --> 01:11:13.126]  They want government cut.
[01:11:13.999 --> 01:11:15.120]  Not tax increases.
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:22.245]  So they're selling it as a revolutionary idea to raise taxes when that actually lowers overall tax receipts.
[01:11:22.445 --> 01:11:24.406]  Every major economist admits that.
[01:11:25.127 --> 01:11:27.148]  When I even tune into CNBC, they admit that.
[01:11:27.208 --> 01:11:27.849]  They know that.
[01:11:28.229 --> 01:11:33.392]  But they want the control over who they tax and then who they give corporate welfare to.
[01:11:33.753 --> 01:11:38.496]  It's a way to consolidate the economy to a planned economy like they have in Communist China.
[01:11:39.497 --> 01:11:39.657]  Now,
[01:11:41.448 --> 01:11:53.275]  We need a revolution of ideas and a revolution at the state level, peacefully taking our legislatures back and then taking control of our federal government itself that's been seized by offshore banks and corporations.
[01:11:53.315 --> 01:11:54.716]  That's what the New World Order is.
[01:11:55.376 --> 01:12:07.243]  They're converting everything to private contractors and private takeovers of highways and water and infrastructure that we as taxpayers paid for and then they jack up the prices once they've been basically given the infrastructure.
[01:12:07.723 --> 01:12:09.843]  It isn't privatization, it's robbery.
[01:12:10.163 --> 01:12:14.724]  It's the corporations becoming government and being unaccountable.
[01:12:15.684 --> 01:12:18.365]  Let's talk to Vernon in Chicago, you're on the air.
[01:12:18.385 --> 01:12:25.306]  Hey Alex, I actually enjoyed listening to your show, but I do have a quick question though.
[01:12:25.326 --> 01:12:36.908]  Well actually on one of your films, I forgot which one, I don't know if it's towards the end of the film, but it mentioned something about a Hegelian dialectic
[01:12:37.575 --> 01:12:43.984]  And I've seen, and before, I've seen a YouTube video that I guess explains a little bit of it, but I don't know
[01:12:44.685 --> 01:12:49.487]  Exactly, or clearly, of what that tactic is, or what media tactic it is.
[01:12:49.587 --> 01:12:59.871]  Are you talking about the... It was a rant I did about two, three years ago, and then we took it and animated it in the film as an extra.
[01:13:00.451 --> 01:13:02.032]  I believe it's the Obama deception.
[01:13:02.052 --> 01:13:03.893]  It may be Fall of the Republic, I forget.
[01:13:04.373 --> 01:13:07.034]  But it's an extra where I expose the left-right paradigm.
[01:13:07.774 --> 01:13:23.580]  And show how, if the system can control the Republicans and the Democrats, that they can lean on each other, because even if one gets taken out of power, they still share power on the other side of the structure, so they basically prop each other up.
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:27.041]  And that was just an analogy that I was giving.
[01:13:28.242 --> 01:13:28.582]  Oh, okay.
[01:13:28.602 --> 01:13:32.783]  Well, actually, I just wanted to add this too, since you answered the question.
[01:13:32.984 --> 01:13:34.064]  Was the same thing
[01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:51.995]  With uh, when Beck brought in, I forgot, he brought in somebody for a show, I guess this was another, or this might have been towards the end of uh, the Police State 4, about Glenn Beck, and I guess this was about uh, I guess the phony FEMA cams that he was gonna bring up old videos, was that part of it?
[01:13:52.967 --> 01:14:00.790]  Well, no, that's a strawman argument, where someone will say, Alex Jones says kill cops.
[01:14:01.490 --> 01:14:03.871]  And everybody says, man, that Alex Jones is bad.
[01:14:04.431 --> 01:14:05.372]  That's a strawman.
[01:14:05.772 --> 01:14:07.032]  I didn't say kill police.
[01:14:07.472 --> 01:14:08.433]  I said the opposite.
[01:14:09.264 --> 01:14:14.807]  But they put media reports out saying Alex likes Joe Stack flying the plane into the building.
[01:14:14.827 --> 01:14:19.190]  You know, Alex influenced the guy that killed the cops in Pittsburgh.
[01:14:19.691 --> 01:14:20.791]  That's a straw man.
[01:14:20.851 --> 01:14:30.797]  Instead of attacking Alex Jones, they create a fake Alex Jones and put statements in his mouth as a way of demonizing me and what Glenn Beck does.
[01:14:31.898 --> 01:14:41.363]  is of the hundreds of admitted FEMA camps, the congressional reports, the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act, which is trying to get funding for what has already been built.
[01:14:41.383 --> 01:14:44.025]  I mean, you read that report, you see the full architecture.
[01:14:44.045 --> 01:14:45.846]  It's exactly what we analyzed years ago.
[01:14:46.686 --> 01:14:57.432]  Instead, he goes and shows the famous train station that isn't a FEMA camp, and then discredits the entire movement by looking at that piece of disinfo.
[01:14:57.952 --> 01:14:59.413]  So that's a strawman system.
[01:15:00.569 --> 01:15:05.091]  Okay, so I guess we'll just come to another interview.
[01:15:05.132 --> 01:15:07.253]  I guess this is from someone you had on the show.
[01:15:07.273 --> 01:15:12.455]  I don't know if it was a sheriff from Arizona that you had on recently.
[01:15:12.816 --> 01:15:18.859]  He was on a local show and I guess the anchor said, oh, you've been on a
[01:15:19.531 --> 01:15:25.793]  You've been on a white supremacist show, you've been on an Alex Jones Show just to try to uh... put it to word of some sort.
[01:15:25.813 --> 01:15:27.153]  Yeah, that's another straw man.
[01:15:27.193 --> 01:15:33.776]  That's exactly what they did on national news and on two different TV stations in Arizona interviewing him.
[01:15:33.816 --> 01:15:35.036]  We played that a few weeks ago.
[01:15:35.476 --> 01:15:39.197]  They would say, you're on white supremacist shows, you're on Alex Jones Show.
[01:15:39.817 --> 01:15:40.818]  So technically
[01:15:41.698 --> 01:15:46.041]  They're talking about a separate White Supremacist show, because he's done hundreds, that he went on and didn't know.
[01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:49.844]  But then they say, you've been on White Supremacist, you've been on Alex Jones.
[01:15:50.385 --> 01:15:53.867]  So, semantically, what they said is true, because it's two different shows.
[01:15:54.648 --> 01:15:58.171]  But, they're now implying I'm a White Supremacist.
[01:15:58.211 --> 01:15:59.051]  That's a straw man.
[01:15:59.072 --> 01:16:04.696]  Alright, well, I actually appreciate you answering my questions.
[01:16:04.716 --> 01:16:05.436]  Keep up the good work.
[01:16:05.877 --> 01:16:07.138]  Vernon, I appreciate your call.
[01:16:07.418 --> 01:16:09.219]  I mean, look, it's another straw man.
[01:16:10.273 --> 01:16:37.865]  to send Democratic Party operatives who've organized in public in Washington State and Texas and Kentucky and New York they've all been caught in the last year over and over again every couple weeks new groups get caught where conservatives, libertarians, patriots go to their meetings they have meet-up groups and others and they say meet us at this coffee shop and then there'll be five or six or ten depending on the meeting people and they go okay we're going to the Tea Party and we're gonna dress up
[01:16:39.411 --> 01:16:44.513]  You know, like Tea Party people, and we're going to call black people and Hispanics names, and we're going to act real stupid.
[01:16:45.494 --> 01:16:52.777]  And then they've been caught in Albuquerque, New Mexico, was another big case, with swastika signs saying, We are the Tea Party!
[01:16:53.037 --> 01:16:54.437]  We hate black people!
[01:16:54.497 --> 01:16:55.878]  We hate N-Words!
[01:16:56.218 --> 01:16:56.678]  N-Word!
[01:16:57.018 --> 01:16:57.499]  N-Word!
[01:16:57.819 --> 01:16:58.099]  N-Word!
[01:16:58.179 --> 01:16:58.459]  N-Word!
[01:16:58.559 --> 01:16:58.959]  N-Word!
[01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:06.062]  So that... And then the news will go with them and show it, and then say on the news, that was the Tea Party.
[01:17:06.502 --> 01:17:07.823]  And that's another straw man.
[01:17:09.161 --> 01:17:13.243]  And they just do this over and over and over and again.
[01:17:13.303 --> 01:17:16.044]  But now because of the Internet, they're getting caught.
[01:17:17.384 --> 01:17:18.605]  They're getting exposed.
[01:17:19.185 --> 01:17:23.607]  And so that's why they want to start shutting down alternative media, because we can point out their lies now.
[01:17:23.927 --> 01:17:28.949]  They're still playing the old game from decades ago when there was an Internet and there was no real alternative media to counter them.
[01:17:28.969 --> 01:17:31.810]  All right, let's go to Nate in Kentucky.
[01:17:32.151 --> 01:17:32.891]  Nate, you're on the air.
[01:17:33.888 --> 01:17:35.629]  Hey Alex, great talking to you.
[01:17:35.669 --> 01:17:39.912]  I missed you out in Chantilly back in 2008, and I'm sorry I missed you on that second day.
[01:17:39.932 --> 01:17:41.453]  It was bloody hot that day.
[01:17:43.254 --> 01:17:52.941]  I was hoping, well first of all I wanted to give you props for waking me up in 2003, and you've encouraged many people to do something.
[01:17:53.241 --> 01:17:54.662]  Do something with the government.
[01:17:54.742 --> 01:17:56.763]  Get involved in local affairs.
[01:17:57.404 --> 01:18:00.326]  And I wanted to see if I could get a plug for my campaign from you.
[01:18:01.667 --> 01:18:01.967]  Sure.
[01:18:01.987 --> 01:18:05.350]  I think we've had some calls from folks plugging campaigns in Kentucky.
[01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:06.992]  Have you called before?
[01:18:07.012 --> 01:18:08.613]  No, I have not.
[01:18:09.654 --> 01:18:21.444]  And for those that don't know, Chantilly was the Bilderberg Group meeting that was in 2008 where Hillary was told to step down and kneel before Barry Sotero, aka Barack Obama.
[01:18:21.884 --> 01:18:23.525]  But what are you running for, Nate, in Kentucky?
[01:18:24.646 --> 01:18:27.729]  I am running as an independent for Sheriff for Meade County.
[01:18:28.974 --> 01:18:38.959]  And I am running against an individual who was the incumbent for 16 years, lost by one vote to the current Republican, and they're both running again.
[01:18:38.979 --> 01:18:41.760]  They're well known around here, where I am not.
[01:18:43.115 --> 01:18:44.576]  I'm not taking anyone's donations.
[01:18:44.796 --> 01:18:46.057]  I'm taking no money whatsoever.
[01:18:46.097 --> 01:18:49.779]  Why should you pay for piss-poor politicians when you can have a good one for free?
[01:18:49.859 --> 01:18:50.720]  Not that I'm a politician.
[01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:52.821]  Okay, but listen, Nate, give us your website.
[01:18:52.861 --> 01:18:53.901]  Tell us the county again.
[01:18:53.922 --> 01:18:55.602]  I have a lot of Kentuckians listening.
[01:18:55.622 --> 01:18:57.444]  They need to get behind getting good sheriffs elected.
[01:18:57.484 --> 01:18:57.864]  Go ahead.
[01:18:58.524 --> 01:18:58.944]  Absolutely.
[01:18:58.984 --> 01:19:00.145]  This is really easy, Alex.
[01:19:00.685 --> 01:19:04.928]  It's www.donttreadonmede.
[01:19:05.268 --> 01:19:08.110]  And the county is M-E-A-D-E.
[01:19:08.490 --> 01:19:10.151]  Donttreadonmede.com.
[01:19:10.871 --> 01:19:12.853]  Mead like the honey liqueur.
[01:19:13.794 --> 01:19:13.994]  Right.
[01:19:14.495 --> 01:19:15.676]  Don't tread on mead.
[01:19:16.056 --> 01:19:17.318]  DontTreadOnMead.com?
[01:19:18.779 --> 01:19:19.060]  Yes sir.
[01:19:19.875 --> 01:19:27.480]  Okay, well, we hope you win, and even if you don't win, you're going to be able to, at those sheriff forums, educate people about the proper role of the sheriff.
[01:19:27.881 --> 01:19:37.167]  That's why we're promoting and selling the film, Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic, how to take the legislatures, the counties, and the sheriffs back and defeat the globalists.
[01:19:37.247 --> 01:19:38.028]  God bless you.
[01:19:38.708 --> 01:19:40.029]  I appreciate your call, Nate.
[01:19:40.069 --> 01:19:40.510]  Keep it up.
[01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:46.053]  Look, you don't want tracker chips in your trash cans giving you $100 fines when you throw the wrong stuff away?
[01:19:46.994 --> 01:19:47.955]  Take over your county?
[01:19:48.736 --> 01:19:49.757]  Say no to Big Brother.
[01:19:50.938 --> 01:19:53.000]  You don't want gun confiscation checkpoints?
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:54.361]  Take over your county.
[01:19:54.622 --> 01:19:55.482]  We are the people.
[01:19:55.803 --> 01:19:56.724]  We are the government.
[01:19:56.824 --> 01:19:57.885]  We are the republic.
[01:19:58.065 --> 01:19:58.906]  And we're rising!
[01:20:00.436 --> 01:20:02.798]  Is your debt problem a ticking time bomb?
[01:20:03.038 --> 01:20:11.704]  Thanks to a new financial consumer relief program designed in response to the economic crisis facing millions of Americans, you don't have to wait until it's too late to defuse your debt.
[01:20:11.844 --> 01:20:24.153]  If you owe $10,000 or more in credit card bills and are struggling to make minimum payments, get ready to take down this number for free information that could potentially save your home, the lifestyle you're accustomed to, and your family's financial well-being.
[01:20:24.333 --> 01:20:25.014]  But don't wait!
[01:20:25.234 --> 01:20:28.216]  Studies show that if most debt problems are confronted directly,
[01:20:28.356 --> 01:20:33.541]  Beneficial settlements, manageable monthly payments, and quick restoration of credit are more easily attained.
[01:20:33.761 --> 01:20:38.145]  Potentially saving you thousands of dollars in interest charges, fees, and unpaid debt.
[01:20:38.265 --> 01:20:39.246]  Don't procrastinate.
[01:20:39.386 --> 01:20:43.690]  Call now for your free information and begin putting your economic house in order today.

[01:20:47.973 --> 01:20:49.854]  Call the American Debt Associates at 800-876-2966.
[01:20:49.874 --> 01:20:49.954]  800-876-2966.
[01:20:49.974 --> 01:20:50.154]  Again, 800-876-2966.
[01:21:00.714 --> 01:21:04.476]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[01:21:51.306 --> 01:21:52.669]  It's HomeGain.com.
[01:21:53.170 --> 01:21:55.654]  H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N.com.
[01:21:55.974 --> 01:21:56.735]  Check them out today.
[01:22:00.034 --> 01:22:00.854]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:22:01.054 --> 01:22:06.396]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[01:22:06.596 --> 01:22:07.016]  I get it.
[01:22:07.136 --> 01:22:16.479]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:17.920]  That's not what's happening.
[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:26.404]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[01:22:26.624 --> 01:22:29.906]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:22:30.026 --> 01:22:34.108]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:22:34.288 --> 01:22:35.868]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:22:35.888 --> 01:22:39.130]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[01:22:39.850 --> 01:22:43.452]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:22:43.652 --> 01:22:44.373]  You should, too.
[01:22:44.553 --> 01:22:45.534]  Find out what they know.
[01:22:45.714 --> 01:22:48.998]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[01:22:49.018 --> 01:22:49.058]  800-686-2237.
[01:22:49.078 --> 01:22:49.379]  800-686-2237.
[01:22:49.399 --> 01:22:49.599]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:59.409 --> 01:23:00.590]  Attention to all U.S.
[01:23:00.630 --> 01:23:08.235]  drivers who own a vehicle that has less than 130,000 miles with an auto warranty about to expire or no warranty coverage at all.
[01:23:08.595 --> 01:23:14.679]  Due to our country's economic crisis and auto repair costs on the rise, if your vehicle has less than 130,000 miles, as of today,
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:26.905]  You could be one of the millions of drivers that now may qualify to have your vehicle covered under United Repair Plans and have 100% of your future covered auto repair bills paid for you.
[01:23:27.285 --> 01:23:31.968]  This low-cost vehicle service contract has been established under United Repair Plans.
[01:23:32.188 --> 01:23:38.829]  And is now available to the general public in order to save drivers thousands of dollars on auto repairs during our country's recession.
[01:23:39.249 --> 01:23:47.591]  If you own a vehicle with less than 130,000 miles, you may now call to see if your vehicle qualifies and for a free 5-minute quote.
[01:23:47.951 --> 01:23:48.851]  Number to call is 800-809-4491.
[01:23:48.871 --> 01:23:48.911]  800-809-4491.
[01:23:48.931 --> 01:23:49.271]  Again, that's 800-809-4491.
[01:24:06.141 --> 01:24:08.142]  Just a program note that I'm going back to your calls.
[01:24:08.162 --> 01:24:10.343]  A bunch of news coming up in the next segment with your calls.
[01:24:11.084 --> 01:24:15.226]  Later in the next hour, I'm going to play a six and a half minute clip that just surfaced on YouTube.
[01:24:16.107 --> 01:24:19.189]  And I know where it came from because it's an interview of yours truly.
[01:24:20.369 --> 01:24:24.952]  Back in January of this year, they said, Chris Matthews wants to come interview you in your office.
[01:24:25.913 --> 01:24:27.714]  And I said, OK, bring it, bring it on.
[01:24:28.886 --> 01:24:33.791]  And then the day before they showed up, they said, well, he is in Houston, but he's not going to come now.
[01:24:34.251 --> 01:24:35.372]  He basically chickened out.
[01:24:36.093 --> 01:24:37.655]  So they sent his producer.
[01:24:38.515 --> 01:24:40.778]  And I was sitting right here being interviewed.
[01:24:40.798 --> 01:24:41.558]  Their camera was there.
[01:24:41.578 --> 01:24:43.961]  They interviewed me for about an hour and a half.
[01:24:44.561 --> 01:24:47.564]  She saw in the drawer over here, a 357 Magnum.
[01:24:48.105 --> 01:24:48.866]  This is my office.
[01:24:49.526 --> 01:24:49.867]  I own it.
[01:24:50.467 --> 01:24:51.589]  I'm going to defend my staff.
[01:24:51.930 --> 01:24:53.954]  We've got a couple of concealed carry people that work here.
[01:24:54.014 --> 01:24:58.061]  I encourage them to wear their sidearms because we're not slaves.
[01:24:58.582 --> 01:25:00.205]  Armed men are free men.
[01:25:01.872 --> 01:25:02.893]  That isn't the video clip.
[01:25:02.913 --> 01:25:03.814]  Maybe they'll release more.
[01:25:04.114 --> 01:25:07.917]  But they released six minutes, and it's not from MSNBC.
[01:25:08.137 --> 01:25:16.343]  It says MSNBC on it, but it's like somebody leaked it or something, because they only took a few clips out of context to kind of make me sound crazy.
[01:25:16.764 --> 01:25:24.570]  They weren't too effective, but you'll actually get to see and hear at least six and a half minutes of an hour and a half of what I really said to them.
[01:25:25.190 --> 01:25:27.292]  But the woman was sitting right here.
[01:25:27.532 --> 01:25:28.353]  I'm facing her.
[01:25:28.393 --> 01:25:30.374]  You'll see the shot later when we play it next hour.
[01:25:31.314 --> 01:25:35.837]  And I'm not kidding, she began to get tears in her eyes and start having trouble breathing.
[01:25:37.137 --> 01:25:38.298]  Like she'd seen Freddy Krueger.
[01:25:38.878 --> 01:25:41.960]  I thought she was about to pass out and I said, are you okay, hon?
[01:25:42.541 --> 01:25:43.881]  And she said, is that a guh guh guh?
[01:25:43.901 --> 01:25:44.462]  She was British.
[01:25:44.702 --> 01:25:49.725]  Is that a guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh gun?
[01:25:50.936 --> 01:26:01.881]  And I said, oh yeah, right over here it's a revolver, it's the best firearm, even if you're good with a more complex handgun, a more high-capacity semi-auto, a revolver's best when you're under stress.
[01:26:02.141 --> 01:26:04.202]  It's a 7-shot .357 Magnum Ruger.
[01:26:05.607 --> 01:26:10.370]  And she was, oh, I'm sorry, I just to see one.
[01:26:11.110 --> 01:26:12.231]  I wish they'd release that.
[01:26:13.031 --> 01:26:16.893]  You know, to have a record, I always record interviews with mainstream media with an audio recorder.
[01:26:17.294 --> 01:26:19.815]  We've got that file on Aaron's computer.
[01:26:19.835 --> 01:26:20.776]  We ought to play that someday.
[01:26:21.556 --> 01:26:24.938]  I was only going to play it if they really butchered what I had to say or really twisted it.
[01:26:25.078 --> 01:26:29.960]  They did it to a certain extent, but we'll play that six and a half minute clip coming up in the next hour.
[01:26:29.980 --> 01:26:32.341]  We're going to post that particular YouTube video that we just discovered.
[01:26:32.361 --> 01:26:33.142]  Matt Ryan found it.
[01:26:33.842 --> 01:26:38.244]  It just came out yesterday at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[01:26:38.704 --> 01:26:39.985]  I just gave it to Kurt Nimmo to post.
[01:26:40.385 --> 01:26:43.587]  But let's go to Tom in Connecticut.
[01:26:43.867 --> 01:26:44.967]  You're on the air, Tom.
[01:26:46.128 --> 01:26:47.568]  It was great hearing that last call.
[01:26:47.608 --> 01:26:48.529]  We're running for sheriff.
[01:26:49.608 --> 01:26:55.274]  Back in 1991, when I was 27 years old, I decided that I was going to run for Congress.
[01:26:55.875 --> 01:26:58.458]  So in 1992, I got my name on the ballot.
[01:26:59.339 --> 01:27:10.671]  I ran as an independent, and I actually got 16%, 39,000 votes, campaigning against the Bilderbergers and the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations and the Federal Reserve.
[01:27:12.674 --> 01:27:15.576]  So anyway, it's more important to run for local office, though.
[01:27:15.816 --> 01:27:18.117]  We definitely need to take our local offices back.
[01:27:18.217 --> 01:27:33.525]  Look, if we get the Patriots to stop obsessing on Sarah Palin's fishnet stockings and take our eyes off of her... well, I'll just leave it at that, and focus on really getting involved locally, we'll take this country back.
[01:27:34.326 --> 01:27:37.688]  Yeah, it starts at the bottom, our local offices.
[01:27:37.728 --> 01:27:40.689]  We've got to take all our local offices back and work our way up.
[01:27:42.697 --> 01:28:00.350]  I wanted to talk about the issue of gold and money, and I sometimes, like last couple weeks when Bob Chapman was on, he said that we need a gold-backed monetary system, and that's not true at all, and I know you agree with that, but I wish you'd be a little more... Well, look, I want to be clear.
[01:28:00.850 --> 01:28:01.391]  Here's the deal.
[01:28:01.891 --> 01:28:04.133]  We'll have somebody on who's pro-Israel.
[01:28:04.773 --> 01:28:07.054]  You know, the most extreme policies.
[01:28:07.134 --> 01:28:08.535]  It doesn't mean I agree with them.
[01:28:09.095 --> 01:28:11.176]  Or I'll have General Hamid Ghul on.
[01:28:11.196 --> 01:28:13.517]  You know, that doesn't mean I'm a Muslim.
[01:28:13.597 --> 01:28:16.378]  We're getting a high-powered guest view on things.
[01:28:16.998 --> 01:28:20.040]  Or I'll have somebody on who's bashing Israel to the hilt.
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:24.922]  That doesn't mean I agree with, you know, some of their extreme views.
[01:28:25.602 --> 01:28:29.704]  I'm here to bring a lot of different ideas in, but I really respect Bob Chapman
[01:28:30.584 --> 01:28:42.291]  And he's saying if we have a gold-backed currency that the government controls, and that's what we had until the Federal Reserve took over, that you wouldn't allow these money changers to manipulate things.
[01:28:42.811 --> 01:28:52.297]  But I understand the other argument that the central banks have used paper money to hoard most of the gold, they know it's really valuable, that they're the biggest owners of it by far, and so they're going to be able
[01:28:52.697 --> 01:28:53.857]  Manipulate that system.
[01:28:53.897 --> 01:28:59.559]  So why get rid of one fiat system to replace it with a hard currency system that they can manipulate?
[01:28:59.899 --> 01:29:08.701]  My point is, let's get rid of the Federal Reserve, put it back under Congress where it's supposed to be under the Constitution, and then have a big debate about that.
[01:29:09.002 --> 01:29:10.322]  And that's why I promote the film.
[01:29:11.314 --> 01:29:12.035]  Let me find it here.
[01:29:13.036 --> 01:29:18.404]  The Secret of Oz by Bill Still, who also made the Money Masters.
[01:29:18.984 --> 01:29:25.653]  And, you know, I like his federal fiat money system because it's highly controlled and transparent.
[01:29:26.394 --> 01:29:26.754]  Stay there.
[01:29:26.774 --> 01:29:28.776]  I want you to be able to finish your point, Tom.
[01:29:28.796 --> 01:29:32.839]  Then I'm going to hurry to Daniel, Tom, Victor, Frank, and others.
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:35.602]  But stay there, Tom, and connect with Tom in Michigan and others.
[01:29:35.622 --> 01:29:39.645]  But by the way, this film has your perspective and really well thought out.
[01:29:39.665 --> 01:29:43.949]  So we're just putting all the alternative ideas out there to have a larger debate.
[01:29:44.229 --> 01:29:47.412]  DVD's available at InfoWars.com discounted.
[01:29:47.432 --> 01:29:48.152]  Very important film.
[01:29:48.192 --> 01:29:48.733]  Very well made.
[01:29:50.374 --> 01:29:51.275]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.795 --> 01:29:53.297]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.301 --> 01:29:57.084]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.587 --> 01:30:02.351]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[01:30:02.731 --> 01:30:06.235]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[01:30:06.516 --> 01:30:09.179]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[01:30:09.399 --> 01:30:14.365]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:14.765 --> 01:30:20.408]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.
[01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:22.730]  It's all fresh, made on a monthly basis.
[01:30:23.050 --> 01:30:26.052]  Not some old cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[01:30:26.372 --> 01:30:30.635]  Try their new Evacuation Pack, a two-week supply of delicious, easy-to-fix food.
[01:30:30.915 --> 01:30:39.040]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it, with open talk of a strike on Iran in the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.
[01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:41.201]  Get yourself and your family ready today.
[01:30:41.601 --> 01:30:43.664]  The place to go is efoodsdirect.com.

[01:30:59.605 --> 01:31:04.469]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:31:04.589 --> 01:31:05.349]  What have we got?
[01:31:05.590 --> 01:31:07.691]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:31:08.031 --> 01:31:08.752]  A republic.
[01:31:09.032 --> 01:31:11.614]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:31:11.674 --> 01:31:13.595]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:31:13.956 --> 01:31:15.857]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:31:15.957 --> 01:31:17.258]  So they think they own our land?
[01:31:17.658 --> 01:31:18.779]  They think they own our water?
[01:31:18.979 --> 01:31:19.380]  Children?
[01:31:19.580 --> 01:31:20.360]  Our education?
[01:31:20.701 --> 01:31:21.301]  Our money?
[01:31:21.521 --> 01:31:25.184]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:31:25.544 --> 01:31:29.248]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:31:30.509 --> 01:31:31.330]  We have the facts.
[01:31:31.530 --> 01:31:32.651]  We have the Constitution.
[01:31:32.711 --> 01:31:33.572]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:31:33.612 --> 01:31:34.433]  We have common law.
[01:31:34.493 --> 01:31:36.755]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:37.015 --> 01:31:40.779]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:31:40.899 --> 01:31:45.682]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:31:45.842 --> 01:31:47.222]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:31:47.343 --> 01:31:48.183]  Don't tread on me.
[01:31:48.443 --> 01:31:55.307]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:31:59.389 --> 01:32:03.610]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:03.930 --> 01:32:04.551]  Number one.
[01:32:04.851 --> 01:32:07.992]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:08.272 --> 01:32:08.852]  Number two.
[01:32:09.132 --> 01:32:13.674]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:14.014 --> 01:32:14.454]  It's true.
[01:32:14.774 --> 01:32:19.315]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:19.635 --> 01:32:20.176]  Number three.
[01:32:20.456 --> 01:32:23.737]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:24.037 --> 01:32:27.738]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:27.958 --> 01:32:28.499]  Number 4.
[01:32:28.759 --> 01:32:31.121]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:31.521 --> 01:32:34.905]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:35.185 --> 01:32:35.405]  Number 5.
[01:32:35.986 --> 01:32:39.909]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:40.129 --> 01:32:44.894]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:45.174 --> 01:32:49.201]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:49.341 --> 01:32:50.923]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:51.144 --> 01:32:53.207]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:32:53.387 --> 01:32:55.731]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:33:02.017 --> 01:33:04.939]  Crashing Through the Lies and Disinformation.
[01:33:05.579 --> 01:33:09.782]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:10.703 --> 01:33:11.343]  That's right.
[01:33:11.563 --> 01:33:13.745]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:13.765 --> 01:33:16.647]  Crashing Through the Lies and Disinformation.
[01:33:16.667 --> 01:33:18.708]  Don't forget, you did it again.
[01:33:18.728 --> 01:33:21.190]  We've been successful every time we've done it.
[01:33:21.950 --> 01:33:23.311]  Technically 14 times.
[01:33:23.331 --> 01:33:27.034]  11 times total, but several times we've done multiple search terms.
[01:33:27.454 --> 01:33:28.535]  For a total of 14.
[01:33:29.075 --> 01:33:31.557]  Number one and number two search terms yesterday.
[01:33:33.218 --> 01:33:40.142]  Kill Web, that linked our story about the plan to kill the Internet as we know it, and the other one, Bombshell Barack.
[01:33:40.182 --> 01:33:44.665]  That's how the headline began about him being a CIA creation and asset.
[01:33:45.325 --> 01:33:58.213]  Today, because Bilderberg's back in the news with Fidel Castro talking about the New World Order and world government, and it being in Time Magazine and a whole bunch of other publications, literally scores of them, we want people to get the full story.
[01:33:58.233 --> 01:33:59.594]  So we want you to search the term
[01:34:01.957 --> 01:34:03.298]  Bilderberg films.
[01:34:03.578 --> 01:34:04.799]  Bilderberg films.
[01:34:04.879 --> 01:34:05.859]  Two words together.
[01:34:05.939 --> 01:34:07.020]  Bilderberg films.
[01:34:07.620 --> 01:34:12.744]  And then that will become the number one search term because of the great power of this listening audience in the Infowar.
[01:34:13.124 --> 01:34:17.847]  And we'll lead them back to the headline article, two films that blew Bilderberg wide open.
[01:34:18.447 --> 01:34:26.792]  Another way to feed this into the search engine is to take this article by Paul Watson at PrisonPlanet.com and send it to everyone you know.
[01:34:26.912 --> 01:34:28.873]  Both the Prison Planet and Infowar link.
[01:34:29.374 --> 01:34:29.814]  And in it,
[01:34:31.198 --> 01:34:34.400]  Are two films that cost me over $250,000 to make.
[01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:40.324]  The two films total cost about $115,000 a piece or so to make.
[01:34:40.624 --> 01:34:41.385]  They're free!
[01:34:42.185 --> 01:34:44.967]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement, free!
[01:34:45.448 --> 01:34:48.490]  Exposing the whole Eugenics Bilderberg Club of Rome plan.
[01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:49.911]  Obama deception.
[01:34:50.191 --> 01:34:53.933]  How they had him and Hillary at a meeting, we were there outside, machine guns pointed at us.
[01:34:54.474 --> 01:35:00.758]  In Chantilly two years ago, the media was put on an airplane, told he was going to Chicago, they literally Shanghai'd him.
[01:35:01.598 --> 01:35:03.620]  We have the news clubs going, we don't know where he is.
[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:04.921]  Well, we knew where he was.
[01:35:05.142 --> 01:35:06.343]  We knew where he was going to be.
[01:35:07.844 --> 01:35:12.128]  You want to educate people and take them to the next level who are out there wondering what the Bilderberg Group is.
[01:35:12.368 --> 01:35:21.676]  This was the number, I think, three and number six search term yesterday Bilderberg was, Bilderberg Group, Bilderberg Club, without us even promoting it because of Castro talking about it.
[01:35:21.716 --> 01:35:24.159]  I mean, this is becoming really mainstream.
[01:35:25.506 --> 01:35:33.690]  But in our films we shatter the left-right paradigm and show how fascism on the far false right and communism on the controlled false left are controlled by the globalists.
[01:35:34.331 --> 01:35:37.852]  So, search the term Bilderberg Films.
[01:35:38.473 --> 01:35:40.234]  Films with an S. Bilderberg Films.
[01:35:40.574 --> 01:35:41.854]  And let's give them some more searches.
[01:35:42.235 --> 01:35:43.996]  Let's search Bilderberg Wide Open.
[01:35:44.236 --> 01:35:45.136]  That's the second search.
[01:35:45.196 --> 01:35:46.257]  Those three words together.
[01:35:46.577 --> 01:35:47.857]  Bilderberg Wide Open.
[01:35:48.198 --> 01:35:49.458]  Type in Bilderberg Wide Open.
[01:35:50.039 --> 01:35:51.039]  And then close your browser.
[01:35:51.639 --> 01:35:53.400]  Or, you know,
[01:35:54.801 --> 01:36:05.046]  Put a new search in, Bilderberg Wide Open, and then close it again, and then enter, Bilderberg Films.
[01:36:05.806 --> 01:36:11.709]  And we'll have the two top search terms today, and people will be able to go see these films for free.
[01:36:12.710 --> 01:36:17.452]  Maybe we should have made the article something like Bilderberg Films Free.
[01:36:17.512 --> 01:36:18.413]  Boy, people love that.
[01:36:19.229 --> 01:36:21.190]  So they understand, hey, they're going to get to free films.
[01:36:21.770 --> 01:36:24.512]  Because if we don't beat these people, I have no future.
[01:36:24.572 --> 01:36:25.332]  You have no future.
[01:36:25.392 --> 01:36:26.873]  I mean, I believe the things I'm saying.
[01:36:27.193 --> 01:36:28.474]  I've read the globalist documents.
[01:36:28.554 --> 01:36:29.955]  I've read their white papers.
[01:36:30.055 --> 01:36:31.175]  I know what they're going to do.
[01:36:31.495 --> 01:36:34.577]  That's how I talk about things 14 years ago, and it's all come true now.
[01:36:35.157 --> 01:36:37.318]  Because I'm just going off what they say they're going to do.
[01:36:37.559 --> 01:36:38.779]  And they mean what they say.
[01:36:38.799 --> 01:36:42.941]  I mean what I say, and I said what I meant.
[01:36:43.242 --> 01:36:47.724]  An elephant's faithful 100%, as the Dr. Seuss book says with Maisy Bird.
[01:36:49.884 --> 01:36:52.586]  And that's another idea.
[01:36:52.606 --> 01:36:54.047]  Will you call Kurt Nemo in here, please?
[01:36:55.449 --> 01:36:56.630]  I'm gonna go hog-wild today.
[01:36:56.650 --> 01:36:59.332]  Let's see how they like three or four top search terms.
[01:36:59.352 --> 01:36:59.972]  We've never done that.
[01:36:59.992 --> 01:37:01.073]  Let's do something new today.
[01:37:01.393 --> 01:37:07.318]  Will you call Kurt out of his little bunker area back there and call him in because there's no time like the present.
[01:37:07.678 --> 01:37:14.364]  Let's search Bilderberg films and Bilderberg wide open, but let's also search
[01:37:16.949 --> 01:37:19.171]  Three Bilderberg films.
[01:37:20.052 --> 01:37:24.015]  Kurt, can you do a little blurb just on top of Watson's article for InfoWars?
[01:37:24.035 --> 01:37:25.877]  Because I want to launch another torpedo at the enemy.
[01:37:26.137 --> 01:37:29.260]  We've never done three or four in one day, and we've always been successful with one or two.
[01:37:30.201 --> 01:37:35.286]  Bilderberg films is the search term today, the primary attack pattern.
[01:37:35.306 --> 01:37:36.287]  That's the main missile.
[01:37:36.767 --> 01:37:43.153]  But the backup hydrogen info weapon we're dropping is Bilderberg wide open.
[01:37:44.369 --> 01:37:45.729]  And all of that will lead into this article.
[01:37:45.750 --> 01:38:01.075]  But I want another search term I think will even be better, that people can also put into their attack profile in the InfoWar, and that's Bilderberg, or Free Bilderberg Films, with an S. Free Bilderberg Films.
[01:38:01.455 --> 01:38:05.496]  And just maybe write a two, three paragraph blurb and then have Watson's article under it with the free video.
[01:38:05.997 --> 01:38:09.778]  Free Bilderberg Films.
[01:38:10.038 --> 01:38:12.399]  And then maybe have a note, see free films below.
[01:38:14.019 --> 01:38:16.540]  And I think this is going to be a devastating operation against the enemy.
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:17.161]  What do you think, Kurt?
[01:38:17.521 --> 01:38:18.201]  Sounds good.
[01:38:18.241 --> 01:38:18.721]  I'll get right on it.
[01:38:18.741 --> 01:38:20.702]  Kurt, we love having you living in Austin.
[01:38:21.403 --> 01:38:22.283]  You like Austin, brother?
[01:38:22.303 --> 01:38:23.444]  Yeah, it's nice.
[01:38:23.464 --> 01:38:24.644]  A little hot, but yeah.
[01:38:25.005 --> 01:38:26.225]  A little hotter than New Mexico?
[01:38:27.486 --> 01:38:28.046]  Well, it's different.
[01:38:28.066 --> 01:38:31.948]  Well, it's 105 and almost 100% humidity with a heat index of 112.
[01:38:31.988 --> 01:38:33.109]  You gotta love it.
[01:38:33.129 --> 01:38:33.789]  I do.
[01:38:33.969 --> 01:38:34.890]  It's not the dry heat.
[01:38:35.790 --> 01:38:37.351]  But it's the dry heat, Sarge!
[01:38:38.351 --> 01:38:39.212]  Name that movie.
[01:38:40.813 --> 01:38:41.193]  Aliens.
[01:38:42.659 --> 01:38:44.420]  But it's a dry heat, Sarge!
[01:38:46.862 --> 01:38:48.282]  Game over.
[01:38:48.302 --> 01:38:49.043]  Kurt, you have done well.
[01:38:49.123 --> 01:38:52.145]  I tell ya, have you seen the Alexa charts on InfoWars?
[01:38:52.165 --> 01:38:53.906]  Yeah, they're off the charts.
[01:38:53.926 --> 01:38:54.386]  Off the... scary!
[01:38:54.406 --> 01:38:57.688]  Like a peak of Mount Everest there.
[01:38:58.048 --> 01:38:59.589]  It's like Spider-Man.
[01:38:59.609 --> 01:39:02.611]  With great power comes great responsibility, and our power is you, the listeners.
[01:39:03.111 --> 01:39:03.812]  Kurt, awesome job.
[01:39:03.832 --> 01:39:05.553]  Thanks, man.
[01:39:05.613 --> 01:39:07.254]  Free Bilderberg films.
[01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:09.972]  Yes, another key search term.
[01:39:09.992 --> 01:39:10.893]  They won't stop us.
[01:39:10.973 --> 01:39:12.094]  Free Bilderberg films.
[01:39:12.374 --> 01:39:13.436]  Hit them and hit them hard!
[01:39:15.218 --> 01:39:20.904]  Jaron made the joke last week that we could have the top ten spell something out where each word spelled something as a code.
[01:39:20.924 --> 01:39:22.466]  That'd be an internet first.
[01:39:22.746 --> 01:39:27.632]  Have all ten of the Google hot terms in one day and have it spell something out.
[01:39:28.971 --> 01:39:29.711]  Alright, I'm going to shut up.
[01:39:29.771 --> 01:39:30.592]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:39:30.612 --> 01:39:31.772]  I've got a bunch of news to cover here.
[01:39:32.072 --> 01:39:33.252]  And we've got Bob Chapman coming up.
[01:39:34.233 --> 01:39:35.613]  Going back to Tom in Connecticut.
[01:39:35.873 --> 01:39:43.376]  Tom, I'll raise your question to Bob Chapman, who I really respect, about whether it should be a gold-backed currency or a fiat-backed currency.
[01:39:43.416 --> 01:39:45.437]  Regardless, Congress should control it.
[01:39:45.757 --> 01:39:48.718]  They are elected by the people.
[01:39:48.958 --> 01:39:50.038]  That's our Constitution.
[01:39:50.258 --> 01:39:51.619]  We've gotten in trouble for getting away with it.
[01:39:53.540 --> 01:39:56.761]  And allowing them to get away with all of this and allowing them to
[01:39:57.941 --> 01:40:04.063]  Well, not that I really have a specific question, but Webster Tarpley on his show about three or four weeks ago mentioned that all money is fiat.
[01:40:04.083 --> 01:40:06.443]  In fact, if you go to YouTube, you can hear this clip.
[01:40:25.939 --> 01:40:31.643]  Just put in, all money is fiat in YouTube, and you'll hear Webster on his show.
[01:40:31.883 --> 01:40:34.465]  Well, I don't specifically totally agree with that.
[01:40:34.505 --> 01:40:38.447]  I mean, if you really limit it to just gold, that's not fiat.
[01:40:38.467 --> 01:40:44.471]  It's a commodity that has an intrinsic industrial and jewelry value.
[01:40:45.372 --> 01:40:49.555]  But money is an invention of humans, and Webster sums it up in that clip on YouTube.
[01:40:49.675 --> 01:40:50.676]  All money is fiat.
[01:40:50.716 --> 01:40:52.517]  Well, I agree to a certain extent that's true.
[01:40:53.297 --> 01:40:54.458]  Yeah, gold is just a rock.
[01:40:54.538 --> 01:40:55.239]  You can't eat it.
[01:40:56.283 --> 01:40:57.603]  Make clothes out of it.
[01:40:57.643 --> 01:40:58.784]  You can't use it for shelter.
[01:40:59.424 --> 01:41:02.185]  Food, clothing, and shelter are three basics of human survival.
[01:41:02.325 --> 01:41:03.645]  Yeah, well, money's been good and bad.
[01:41:03.685 --> 01:41:05.006]  I mean, it gets us past barter.
[01:41:05.046 --> 01:41:06.706]  It allows people to engage in trade.
[01:41:07.146 --> 01:41:09.507]  It's when you allow money to be manipulated you have the problem.
[01:41:10.207 --> 01:41:23.111]  Well, George Whitehurst Berry's show that comes on just before your show on Genesis, Ellen Brown with her book, The Web of Debt, and Bill Still with his movies, those three people right there are right
[01:41:23.827 --> 01:41:28.729]  At the very tip of the spear of how we attack the debt money bankers.
[01:41:28.949 --> 01:41:31.050]  Tom, listen, I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[01:41:31.090 --> 01:41:31.871]  I've got to move along.
[01:41:31.951 --> 01:41:33.111]  I'll bring it up to Bob Chapman.
[01:41:33.551 --> 01:41:36.613]  I've had that lady on calling for the Dakota-style bank.
[01:41:37.573 --> 01:41:40.274]  And, of course, I've had Mr. Still on.
[01:41:42.395 --> 01:41:48.858]  We know we don't want the private Federal Reserve with undue trade advantage running our whole society and getting us into debt by design.
[01:41:50.393 --> 01:42:00.939]  And Goldman Sachs selling timber wool stock knowing it's pure, well they called it a cuss word, pure SH bleep T. We know that.
[01:42:02.019 --> 01:42:06.022]  But the issue here is I'm just having a full spectrum debate about it.
[01:42:07.102 --> 01:42:08.483]  And people get hung up on this a lot.
[01:42:08.503 --> 01:42:18.128]  They're like, well you had a guest on saying that the flu isn't going to be a crisis in April, but then a month later you had a guest on thinking it was going to be a crisis.
[01:42:18.248 --> 01:42:18.829]  Exactly!
[01:42:19.794 --> 01:42:20.281]  This is a...
[01:42:22.483 --> 01:42:25.465]  Three hour radio show weekdays, two hours on Sundays.
[01:42:25.845 --> 01:42:33.870]  This is not like religious, where everything is one way, and I tell guests before they come on, this is what you can and can't talk about.
[01:42:34.190 --> 01:42:34.850]  We don't do that.
[01:42:35.291 --> 01:42:37.292]  We just have larger debates about it.
[01:42:37.932 --> 01:42:40.634]  But I do understand the points you're making, and we'll bring it up to Bob Chapman.
[01:42:40.854 --> 01:42:42.595]  Hey, you want to see what Bill Still has to say?
[01:42:42.615 --> 01:42:44.336]  We got the movie, it's incredibly well produced.
[01:42:45.137 --> 01:42:50.660]  A lot of people have been getting this, The Secret of Oz, Solutions for a Broken Economy, available at Infowars.com.
[01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:51.761]  In fact, let me just read from the back.
[01:42:52.605 --> 01:42:57.308]  Could it be that symbols of monetary reform were embedded in the most beloved children's story of all time?
[01:42:57.688 --> 01:43:00.930]  By the way, Bill Still said on air, I didn't know this, that I told him about this.
[01:43:00.970 --> 01:43:01.730]  He didn't know about it.
[01:43:01.770 --> 01:43:02.551]  He didn't really believe it.
[01:43:02.811 --> 01:43:04.432]  He went and looked it up and found out it was all true.
[01:43:05.493 --> 01:43:07.074]  So see, we're doing good work here.
[01:43:08.208 --> 01:43:18.534]  And if I didn't go on a limb to explain to him that this was a best-selling play, best-selling book, a decade before the Federal Reserve took over, he wouldn't have known that.
[01:43:18.874 --> 01:43:28.800]  The average person, that sounds crazy, that The Wizard of Oz is about the Federal Reserve and the private bankers, before they even called it the Federal Reserve, but I know it was true, so I said it.
[01:43:29.181 --> 01:43:31.042]  He went and researched it and found out it was real.
[01:43:31.482 --> 01:43:32.883]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[01:43:36.104 --> 01:43:40.988]  Could it be that symbols of monetary reform were embedded in the most beloved children's story of all time?
[01:43:42.669 --> 01:43:43.850]  The Wonderful Wizard of Oz?
[01:43:44.351 --> 01:43:48.114]  Could it be that there were symbols point the way of our economic troubles today?
[01:43:48.134 --> 01:44:00.064]  And of course, the silver slippers are what save you from the gold monopoly because it's more plentiful and a better metals-backed currency, historically, than gold.
[01:44:01.328 --> 01:44:03.812]  What's the secret behind the Wizard of Oz?
[01:44:03.912 --> 01:44:05.535]  Nations don't have to borrow money.
[01:44:05.635 --> 01:44:06.617]  That's a right.
[01:44:06.978 --> 01:44:08.220]  No more national debt.
[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:10.924]  It's the interest on the debt that's killing the economy.
[01:44:11.245 --> 01:44:12.807]  The solution is nothing radical.
[01:44:13.028 --> 01:44:14.911]  Abraham Lincoln used it to win the Civil War.
[01:44:15.984 --> 01:44:18.325]  Colonial America became prosperous by this method.
[01:44:18.745 --> 01:44:29.068]  Director Bill Still focuses on the populist movement of the late 1800s, with William Jennings Bryant era, when the monetary reformers were strongest, right when The Wonderful Wizard of Oz was written.
[01:44:29.368 --> 01:44:31.748]  He offers the best solutions from these experts.
[01:44:32.229 --> 01:44:32.729]  Ellen Brown?
[01:44:33.849 --> 01:44:41.435]  Byron Dale, Joseph Farah, Professor Michael Hudson, James Robertson, Peter Schiff, Professor Quentin Taylor, and more.
[01:44:42.056 --> 01:44:45.339]  Very important film, available at Infowars.com.
[01:44:45.779 --> 01:44:47.681]  Okay, so yes, I'm promoting that idea.
[01:44:48.021 --> 01:44:49.202]  I tend to agree with you.
[01:44:51.581 --> 01:45:00.004]  But at the same time, I know that in the inflationary economy, in the depreciation of currency, gold is king.
[01:45:00.324 --> 01:45:05.286]  So I believe in owning gold, and it's gone up from 260 to 1,200 and something right now.
[01:45:05.306 --> 01:45:07.467]  I mean, you can see in the last eight years, good advice.
[01:45:08.048 --> 01:45:11.329]  Let's go now to Daniel in Washington, D.C.
[01:45:11.649 --> 01:45:12.609]  Daniel, you're on the air.
[01:45:13.990 --> 01:45:15.591]  Hello there to you, Alex.
[01:45:15.651 --> 01:45:18.592]  Happy Friday, and thanks again for having me back on.
[01:45:18.652 --> 01:45:19.152]  How are you feeling?
[01:45:19.977 --> 01:45:20.758]  That's great to have you, sir.
[01:45:20.778 --> 01:45:21.318]  What's on your mind?
[01:45:22.039 --> 01:45:29.104]  Well, uh, I just, um, wanted to just really briefly just touch on the, uh, this, this whole Moss situation really quick.
[01:45:29.624 --> 01:45:39.712]  A good friend of mine, she had, uh, posted an article from NewYorkDailyNews.com that, and, uh, and the headline appears to be they won't build it.
[01:45:40.174 --> 01:45:42.595]  Hard hats down not to work on controversial mosques.
[01:45:42.635 --> 01:45:43.715]  Yeah, I've got the story.
[01:45:43.735 --> 01:45:47.097]  The local unions are saying that mosque isn't getting built there.
[01:45:47.177 --> 01:45:50.918]  And this is a big blow to property rights regardless of what you think about this.
[01:45:51.459 --> 01:45:52.999]  This is a dangerous precedent.
[01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:59.742]  And that's how it started in Nazi Germany where they wouldn't let Jews have businesses and other groups.
[01:46:00.342 --> 01:46:06.565]  And it's a very, very dangerous attack on the First Amendment and property rights.
[01:46:07.105 --> 01:46:07.925]  And I'm concerned.
[01:46:07.965 --> 01:46:09.506]  But I'm telling this imam
[01:46:10.166 --> 01:46:17.772]  It's not going to help him that I now have found a video clip of him, and I'm going to cover it later, saying that America is Sharia-compliant.
[01:46:19.053 --> 01:46:23.016]  And that's going to really make people even more angry and upset.
[01:46:23.577 --> 01:46:30.242]  And I think he needs to know this is a fight he's going to lose, and he's giving his attackers a lot of ammo.
[01:46:30.502 --> 01:46:35.206]  He ought to look for another location because, pragmatically, they're going to lose this thing.
[01:46:35.226 --> 01:46:35.907]  But go ahead.
[01:46:37.448 --> 01:46:37.928]  Absolutely.
[01:46:39.339 --> 01:46:50.044]  I didn't go as in-depth as you just did, but I mean, I just pretty much, I left her a comment on it, on the post or whatever, and I pretty much succinctly sort of went through it, if I can just briefly, it's not very long at all.
[01:46:50.064 --> 01:46:50.744]  Go ahead.
[01:46:50.764 --> 01:46:50.844]  Okay.
[01:46:51.144 --> 01:47:02.969]  So a comment, I said, I don't think the federal government has a right to interfere with private property, amongst a myriad of other things they interfere with in this country, and we do still have freedom of religion here.
[01:47:03.290 --> 01:47:06.251]  And quite frankly, I think we all need to grow up and do some research.
[01:47:06.651 --> 01:47:07.072]  I think so.
[01:47:24.998 --> 01:47:34.007]  It needlessly stirs unnecessary tension and infighting among we, the people, and provides a divisive and convenient socio-political distraction for the owners of this country to capitalize on.
[01:47:34.288 --> 01:47:44.959]  And the owners of this country, Alex, you know, as you know, you being a fellow Carlin fan, I believe you are, you know, that's who he referred to, to these, to these global owners of this country.
[01:47:45.427 --> 01:47:48.369]  Because the owners of this country don't want you to be educated.
[01:47:48.409 --> 01:47:49.970]  That's why education will never be fixed.
[01:47:50.330 --> 01:47:52.171]  The more money we spend, the dumber we get.
[01:47:52.511 --> 01:47:56.553]  Because the owners want you dumbed down and barely treading water.
[01:47:56.853 --> 01:47:57.834]  I appreciate your call.
[01:47:57.954 --> 01:48:01.496]  Great points from Daniel in Washington, D.C.
[01:48:01.996 --> 01:48:04.017]  Give me a document cam shot, gentlemen.
[01:48:04.097 --> 01:48:07.219]  Since he raised this issue, I'll cover it briefly now and then go back to calls.
[01:48:07.999 --> 01:48:08.420]  Here it is.
[01:48:08.460 --> 01:48:14.063]  Ground Zero Emam says America is Sharia-compliant country.
[01:48:15.267 --> 01:48:16.528]  And we have that video clip.
[01:48:17.128 --> 01:48:18.069]  It's from C-SPAN.
[01:48:18.089 --> 01:48:21.452]  We'll play that next hour when Bob Chapman's on and get his take on it.
[01:48:22.052 --> 01:48:22.733]  Here's another one.
[01:48:22.893 --> 01:48:25.034]  The Ground Zero Mosque and Property Rights.
[01:48:25.515 --> 01:48:33.881]  Excellent article out today by Kurt Nemo that really breaks down the fact that the majority of Americans in a poll say they don't want it built there and want it to be stopped.
[01:48:34.241 --> 01:48:36.423]  Well, you don't want your rights either then, do you?
[01:48:37.421 --> 01:48:42.323]  Look, I don't like white supremacists and their free speech, but I've got to defend it or I'll lose mine.
[01:48:42.643 --> 01:48:48.285]  I don't like Mecha and La Raza saying, for those in our race, everything, for those outside the race, nothing.
[01:48:48.565 --> 01:48:49.745]  But they're allowed to say that.
[01:48:50.845 --> 01:48:56.647]  I don't like some of those new Black Panther Party people that make the old Black Panther Party that did some good, actually, in the 60s.
[01:48:56.687 --> 01:48:59.428]  We really heard what they said about freedom.
[01:49:00.709 --> 01:49:01.149]  They make
[01:49:03.100 --> 01:49:04.181]  The old Black Panthers look bad.
[01:49:04.221 --> 01:49:07.483]  You know, they're out saying, you know, get the whiteys, kill the whiteys.
[01:49:07.903 --> 01:49:09.785]  That borders on, though, firing a theater.
[01:49:09.805 --> 01:49:13.087]  When you start saying kill a group, then they need to be questioned.
[01:49:13.107 --> 01:49:16.610]  Because now you're, you know, I mean, if I got up here and said go after and kill somebody, I should get in trouble.
[01:49:17.110 --> 01:49:19.172]  So that group's going a little overboard.
[01:49:19.212 --> 01:49:23.194]  But if you don't support somebody's free speech for them, you're not going to have it.
[01:49:23.615 --> 01:49:25.036]  Here's the Surreal Law clip.
[01:49:26.584 --> 01:49:31.387]  This is why the third chapter of my book is what is right with America.
[01:49:32.007 --> 01:49:36.750]  And to show that what's right with America, what's right with Islam, are in fact very much in sync.
[01:49:39.032 --> 01:49:49.258]  Seven centuries ago, one of the most important jurists said all of Sharia law is basically the fulfillment of five fundamental human rights.
[01:49:50.356 --> 01:50:00.843]  The right to life, the right to freedom of religion, the right to family, the right to property, and the right to what is called under Muslim law, mental well-being.
[01:50:02.704 --> 01:50:10.309]  Now how similar is this to the American Declaration of Independence, which declares that we were created equal,
[01:50:11.810 --> 01:50:28.433]  All men, meaning men and women, were created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, among which, among which, not all, but among which, are life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness, which was originally property.
[01:50:29.193 --> 01:50:38.115]  Now, when you look at, when you unpack the concepts and ideas this way, you will see, this is why I call America a Sharia-compliant state.
[01:50:39.944 --> 01:50:51.795]  Okay, that is going to be used against him, because if you look at Sharia law the way it's interpreted in Saudi Arabia, or in Sudan, I'm definitely against that.
[01:50:51.895 --> 01:50:55.018]  So, this guy really is in a lot of trouble now.
[01:50:55.719 --> 01:50:56.520]  Okay, we'll be right back.
[01:51:00.319 --> 01:51:01.580]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:01.620 --> 01:51:06.962]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.203 --> 01:51:11.845]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.225 --> 01:51:17.268]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:17.788 --> 01:51:22.493]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.013 --> 01:51:29.940]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.140 --> 01:51:31.041]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:31.261 --> 01:51:37.627]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:37.927 --> 01:51:40.768]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:41.128 --> 01:51:43.008]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:43.348 --> 01:51:44.268]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:44.288 --> 01:51:44.589]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:44.609 --> 01:51:47.429]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:47.929 --> 01:51:49.650]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:00.094 --> 01:52:00.554]  Attention!
[01:52:00.694 --> 01:52:05.596]  This is a special alert to all Americans who owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS.
[01:52:05.696 --> 01:52:11.238]  The IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from people who owe back taxes and dramatically lowering amounts owed.
[01:52:11.378 --> 01:52:18.340]  Due to the financial crisis in America, the IRS has announced a leniency plan in recognition of consumers' financial troubles in today's economy.
[01:52:18.521 --> 01:52:27.264]  If you owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, an open phone line has been established by American Tax Settlement for you to call and see if you qualify for a reduction by up to 75%.
[01:52:28.484 --> 01:52:31.405]  Number to call is 800-902-6969.
[01:52:31.645 --> 01:52:38.266]  Again, the IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from consumers who owe back taxes in response to the decline in today's economy.
[01:52:38.467 --> 01:52:47.289]  If you are struggling with $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, you now may be eligible for a dramatic reduction by up to 75% and save thousands of dollars.
[01:52:47.429 --> 01:52:52.030]  For free information and to see if you qualify, call the open phone line into American Tax Settlement now.
[01:52:52.430 --> 01:52:53.351]  800-902-6969.
[01:52:53.371 --> 01:52:55.554]  800-902-6969.
[01:52:56.696 --> 01:52:58.898]  Again, 800-902-6969.
[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:05.367]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website, yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[01:53:05.487 --> 01:53:08.130]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[01:53:08.230 --> 01:53:10.133]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[01:53:10.433 --> 01:53:11.614]  Okay, here it comes.
[01:53:11.854 --> 01:53:13.736]  But first, the facts.
[01:53:13.756 --> 01:53:17.400]  67 other products merely treat symptoms and not the cause of sinus problems.
[01:53:17.660 --> 01:53:21.164]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[01:53:21.364 --> 01:53:28.751]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[01:53:29.111 --> 01:53:29.772]  Sinofresh.
[01:53:29.992 --> 01:53:32.835]  Now here's your limited time discount offer to use Sinofresh.

[01:53:51.284 --> 01:53:51.684]  It works!
[01:54:05.711 --> 01:54:11.073]  The Babylon system is the vampire, drinking the blood of the children.
[01:54:13.774 --> 01:54:22.556]  Key article by Steve Watson just out.
[01:54:23.076 --> 01:54:26.177]  Ground Zero mosque imam is a globalist stooge.
[01:54:26.758 --> 01:54:33.920]  That's what I thought in my gut the last month, but I've been so busy with other World War III issues, economy issues, police state issues.
[01:54:35.322 --> 01:54:36.443]  Deadly Flu Vaccine?
[01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:58.644]  The Middle East itself, and hype everybody up to, they're in our territory, let's get Iran!
[01:54:59.304 --> 01:55:03.348]  And Steve Watson's done a stunning job, Ground Zero Mosque, Imam's Global Astuge.
[01:55:03.648 --> 01:55:05.990]  We'll talk about it with Bob Chapman coming up at the 8 after.
[01:55:06.010 --> 01:55:10.554]  I want to get to Tom, Victor, Frank, Michael, and Joe before Bob gets here.
[01:55:10.574 --> 01:55:13.556]  If not, we'll get to you while Bob's on, but I'm going to Tom and Victor in a moment.
[01:55:14.297 --> 01:55:18.420]  First, I wanted to really tell you about firearms training and a way to get a great free firearm.
[01:55:20.725 --> 01:55:22.126]  Front Sight Firearms Training.
[01:55:22.206 --> 01:55:26.110]  FrontSight.com has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[01:55:26.670 --> 01:55:32.535]  You can get five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-stake concealed weapons permit.
[01:55:32.555 --> 01:55:36.459]  They also have a lot of great free training tips on their website, FrontSight.com.
[01:55:37.059 --> 01:55:41.243]  You can get the five days of world-class training, 30-stake concealed weapons, all for pennies on the dollar.
[01:55:41.283 --> 01:55:42.464]  It's very inexpensive.
[01:55:42.904 --> 01:55:44.546]  No drill instructor or tough guy attitude.
[01:55:44.566 --> 01:55:45.466]  And if you act fast,
[01:55:46.167 --> 01:55:50.752]  The owner will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:55:50.913 --> 01:55:52.575]  Frontsight.com.
[01:55:52.615 --> 01:55:53.456]  Like the front of your rifle.
[01:55:53.736 --> 01:55:54.677]  Frontsight.com.
[01:55:55.798 --> 01:55:57.921]  And lastly, Acolabloo.com.
[01:55:58.081 --> 01:56:00.604]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com.
[01:56:00.644 --> 01:56:01.145]  Acolabloo.
[01:56:01.425 --> 01:56:01.925]  We're good to go.
[01:56:27.402 --> 01:56:34.928]  How you doing Alex?
[01:56:37.771 --> 01:56:39.772]  I'm doing well sir, we're hitting on all cylinders.
[01:56:40.613 --> 01:56:42.935]  Yeah, long time listener, first time caller.
[01:56:44.696 --> 01:56:54.885]  Just wanted to make somebody aware, or maybe you know about this, but here in Michigan, where I live, there's a maximum security prison in Standish.
[01:56:55.692 --> 01:57:01.395]  Now, it's been closed now for about a year because of budget problems that Michigan's had, as you well know.
[01:57:03.296 --> 01:57:11.059]  Originally, they were looking to get Gitmo people up in this facility, because it's a big employer of the area, okay?
[01:57:11.300 --> 01:57:14.521]  And it's devastated the Standish area here in Michigan.
[01:57:15.502 --> 01:57:19.123]  And my wife and I were talking, and I said, well, you know what?
[01:57:19.423 --> 01:57:20.804]  I bet you the feds are going to come in.
[01:57:20.884 --> 01:57:22.345]  And sure enough, about two weeks ago,
[01:57:23.214 --> 01:57:23.654]  I don't know.
[01:57:45.794 --> 01:57:48.295]  I'm looking at the same thing that happened to this facility.
[01:57:48.515 --> 01:57:56.299]  Oh, and they looked at turning that camp out in Montana into a FEMA camp, and then it was even on CNN.
[01:57:56.319 --> 01:57:57.500]  We went there and they denied it.
[01:57:57.880 --> 01:58:06.985]  I snuck in one of the offices and shot video during our tour, and it was like, you know, alien holding facility, combatant holding facilities.
[01:58:07.845 --> 01:58:12.129]  And this whole archipelago, we have more prisons than any other country on earth.
[01:58:12.589 --> 01:58:13.630]  They're only building more.
[01:58:14.011 --> 01:58:15.532]  The state governments are imploding.
[01:58:15.572 --> 01:58:16.893]  The federal government's growing.
[01:58:17.434 --> 01:58:18.555]  And it's very, very dangerous.
[01:58:18.575 --> 01:58:19.756]  But we'll look into that prison.
[01:58:19.776 --> 01:58:20.757]  I had seen it in the news.
[01:58:21.077 --> 01:58:21.918]  Good points, Tom.
[01:58:22.378 --> 01:58:24.700]  Victor, Frank, Michael, Joe, your call's straight ahead.
[01:58:24.720 --> 01:58:26.262]  We're going to start the third hour.
[01:58:26.942 --> 01:58:29.725]  Seventy seconds after we go to break, I'm going to go to some of your calls.
[01:58:30.776 --> 01:58:36.723]  That'll bring up a host of issues, not just the economy, with Bob Chapman coming up in the third hour.
[01:58:37.223 --> 01:58:39.506]  Don't forget, we're exposing the Bilderberg Group today as well.
[01:58:39.526 --> 01:58:47.635]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:49.773 --> 01:58:51.374]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[01:59:11.084 --> 01:59:13.405]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[01:59:13.745 --> 01:59:19.946]  Since 1947, Calbin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[01:59:20.247 --> 01:59:21.647]  Buy American and stay clean.

[01:59:52.866 --> 01:59:54.808]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.248 --> 01:59:58.070]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:04.727 --> 02:00:08.911]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:09.571 --> 02:00:10.372]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.152 --> 02:00:12.073]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.093 --> 02:00:16.397]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.897 --> 02:00:20.961]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.189 --> 02:00:28.230]  Well, I knew there was something fishy going on.
[02:00:28.270 --> 02:00:30.332]  This article just went up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:00:30.632 --> 02:00:32.913]  Ground Zero Mosque Imam is a global astute.
[02:00:32.933 --> 02:00:33.814]  The whole thing staged.
[02:00:34.214 --> 02:00:35.855]  Steve Watson conclusively proved it.
[02:00:36.316 --> 02:00:37.937]  We're taking your phone calls right now.
[02:00:38.017 --> 02:00:41.539]  Bob Chapman's coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:41.559 --> 02:00:46.562]  We'll continue with calls throughout this transmission today.
[02:00:47.423 --> 02:00:48.744]  Let's now go back to your calls.
[02:00:48.944 --> 02:00:50.065]  Victor in California.
[02:00:50.085 --> 02:00:51.005]  You're on the air, Victor.
[02:00:52.006 --> 02:00:52.566]  Hello.
[02:00:52.686 --> 02:00:54.207]  I'm really glad you're there, Alex.
[02:00:56.050 --> 02:00:59.252]  I got about two, uh, two, uh, things to say.
[02:00:59.272 --> 02:00:59.933]  Hit me!
[02:00:59.993 --> 02:01:00.473]  Hello?
[02:01:00.813 --> 02:01:01.174]  Hit me!
[02:01:01.314 --> 02:01:01.694]  Oh, okay.
[02:01:03.235 --> 02:01:12.362]  Uh, well, I watch those 9-11 documentaries and I always hear them going into public places saying 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:01:12.922 --> 02:01:22.249]  And people's eyes, like you were saying, really are opening because I'm at a fast food restaurant and I get so mad at the direction that this has taken us.
[02:01:22.849 --> 02:01:25.511]  I just scream out, 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:01:26.129 --> 02:01:35.174]  And like, uh, three, you know, out of the first three, the first three were, were like, uh, cheering me on, saying, hey, where have you been?
[02:01:35.215 --> 02:01:35.875]  We know that.
[02:01:36.815 --> 02:01:40.738]  And see, we all feel what you said here is what will defeat the globalists.
[02:01:41.298 --> 02:01:42.539]  Resistance is victory.
[02:01:42.939 --> 02:01:45.861]  And just by sounding off, the bankers are robbing us.
[02:01:46.281 --> 02:01:47.562]  I don't want world government.
[02:01:47.942 --> 02:01:48.983]  Take the states back.
[02:01:49.843 --> 02:01:51.083]  9-11's an inside job.
[02:01:51.504 --> 02:01:53.084]  No on the Iran attack.
[02:01:53.404 --> 02:01:58.445]  Just by declaring it, other people are going to go, I agree with you, and you'll find out you're the majority.
[02:01:58.705 --> 02:02:04.086]  We all feel like we're the minority because the media says everybody loves flu shots that make you have convulsions.
[02:02:04.547 --> 02:02:06.807]  Everybody loves the aspartame causing diabetes.
[02:02:07.207 --> 02:02:14.909]  Everybody loves hundreds of thousands of little girls going into puberty at age 7 or 8 with the bisphenol A. Everybody loves illegal checkpoints.
[02:02:14.969 --> 02:02:16.289]  Everybody loves open borders.
[02:02:16.629 --> 02:02:18.270]  No, everybody doesn't love it.
[02:02:18.330 --> 02:02:18.690]  Go ahead.
[02:02:20.064 --> 02:02:34.356]  Um, and the other thing, I got myself a website, and I put up three of the videos that you, uh, that I ordered, and, uh, if you allow me, I would be, uh, I would like to advertise my website.
[02:02:34.817 --> 02:02:35.617]  Sure, go ahead, buddy.
[02:02:36.678 --> 02:02:47.828]  Alright, UFOclips.com, we got the, uh, 9-11 Chronicle, Obama, uh, and, uh, Obama Deception, and, uh, I think it's, what is it?
[02:02:48.900 --> 02:02:51.942]  Invisible... Invisible Empire, Victor.
[02:02:51.982 --> 02:02:53.183]  I appreciate your call.
[02:02:53.583 --> 02:02:54.844]  Let's go to Frank in Florida.
[02:02:54.884 --> 02:02:55.785]  Frank, you're on the air.
[02:02:55.825 --> 02:02:56.185]  Welcome.
[02:02:57.005 --> 02:02:59.107]  Alex, I got two questions.
[02:02:59.147 --> 02:03:00.748]  The first one is for Bob, really.
[02:03:00.908 --> 02:03:04.590]  I want to know why do companies that sell gold coins sell them?
[02:03:04.630 --> 02:03:07.652]  What's in it for them to trade metal for paper?
[02:03:08.513 --> 02:03:18.139]  And two, in the meantime, I wanted to ask you, were these infamous airplanes that hit the Twin Towers special empty remote-controlled jets from an Air Force base?
[02:03:19.356 --> 02:03:22.778]  Or did Muslims take over?
[02:03:22.898 --> 02:03:27.082]  Okay, very complex, extremely complex issues, both of them.
[02:03:27.943 --> 02:03:33.607]  Let me take your second question now, and then I'll get Bob, who's on hold, when we come back to comment on your gold question.
[02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.302]  We don't know exactly what happened on 9-11.
[02:03:37.422 --> 02:03:38.503]  Let me be clear.
[02:03:39.104 --> 02:03:42.427]  But we know that the official story is 100% lies.
[02:03:42.487 --> 02:03:43.308]  We've looked at that.
[02:03:43.328 --> 02:03:47.272]  I mean, we have police saying, get back, they're going to blow 7-Up and they blow it up.
[02:03:47.712 --> 02:03:55.880]  We've got the news announcing it had fallen in its own footprint an hour before and then 25 minutes before on two BBC channels and CNN.
[02:03:57.081 --> 02:03:58.863]  We know that NORAD stood down.
[02:03:58.883 --> 02:04:01.444]  There were drills of the exact same targets being attacked that day.
[02:04:01.785 --> 02:04:03.806]  We know the supposed hijackers were U.S.
[02:04:03.846 --> 02:04:05.647]  double agents trained at military bases.
[02:04:05.687 --> 02:04:07.108]  Newsweek, AP, Reuters.
[02:04:08.069 --> 02:04:11.131]  And every time, we know six of the ten commissioners say it's a cover-up.
[02:04:11.191 --> 02:04:13.653]  Three of the five lawyers on the commission.
[02:04:14.073 --> 02:04:15.894]  So we know they had the pretext.
[02:04:15.914 --> 02:04:18.756]  We know PNAC called for terror attacks as a pretext.
[02:04:19.036 --> 02:04:23.459]  We know our government staged terror attacks before, but specifically
[02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:28.221]  In any black op, they've got all the smoke screens so they can get away with it.
[02:04:28.261 --> 02:04:29.381]  They've got all the confusion.
[02:04:29.641 --> 02:04:34.962]  They've got drills running so in case their agents get caught by other branches of the government, they say it's part of the drill.
[02:04:35.442 --> 02:04:37.263]  It's part of that artificial fog of war.
[02:04:37.783 --> 02:04:46.925]  So we don't know, but there was some chicanery in Pennsylvania at NASA bases and planes being switched with the same tail numbers and people being brought off planes.
[02:04:46.965 --> 02:04:47.745]  That's confirmed.
[02:04:48.425 --> 02:04:52.186]  I've got my own theories about it, but all I know is they had the motive for that.
[02:04:52.206 --> 02:04:53.686]  The official story's a lie.
[02:04:53.966 --> 02:04:57.487]  It has intelligence, Western intelligence footprints and fingerprints all over.
[02:04:57.507 --> 02:04:58.107]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:59.647 --> 02:05:00.407]  Listen up, friends.
[02:05:00.447 --> 02:05:02.388]  This is Alex Jones with key information.

[02:06:56.694 --> 02:06:58.417]  This information is too important to wait.
[02:07:03.516 --> 02:07:04.397]  Tyranny is here.
[02:07:04.777 --> 02:07:08.299]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:07:08.660 --> 02:07:10.961]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:07:11.121 --> 02:07:16.385]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:07:16.805 --> 02:07:23.089]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:07:23.489 --> 02:07:29.053]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:07:29.433 --> 02:07:33.136]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:07:33.616 --> 02:07:37.598]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:07:37.918 --> 02:07:43.801]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:07:43.861 --> 02:07:46.842]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:07:47.422 --> 02:07:48.823]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:07:49.383 --> 02:07:49.903]  It's here.

[02:08:05.876 --> 02:08:17.348]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[02:08:20.972 --> 02:08:23.614]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:28.945 --> 02:08:29.745]  It is Friday.
[02:08:29.765 --> 02:08:31.366]  Bob Chapman's with us for the rest of the hour.
[02:08:31.386 --> 02:08:34.067]  We're going to play a six-minute clip towards the end of the show.
[02:08:34.127 --> 02:08:35.047]  It appeared out of nowhere.
[02:08:35.067 --> 02:08:35.827]  I don't know where it came from.
[02:08:35.887 --> 02:08:42.149]  A listener sent it to us on Facebook of the behind-the-scenes interview from MSNBC's cameras.
[02:08:42.169 --> 02:08:47.111]  They edited it all together in that Tea Party special where they try to do a hit piece on myself and Rand Paul.
[02:08:47.571 --> 02:08:51.132]  But this is six minutes of the hour-and-a-half interview where you actually get to hear what I really said.
[02:08:51.892 --> 02:08:54.433]  And I don't know where this came from or who got it.
[02:08:54.813 --> 02:08:57.534]  Probably somebody inside MSNBC, so that'll be interesting.
[02:08:58.334 --> 02:09:01.515]  Don't forget we're doing another keyword search today because folks are clamoring.
[02:09:01.555 --> 02:09:06.076]  They know it's effective and it's up to you to make this another big winner in the InfoWar.
[02:09:06.216 --> 02:09:08.277]  Search the term Bilderberg Films.
[02:09:08.977 --> 02:09:10.317]  It'll be the number one search term.
[02:09:10.357 --> 02:09:11.778]  We've never failed, thanks to you.
[02:09:12.078 --> 02:09:13.198]  And it'll lead them to this article.
[02:09:13.278 --> 02:09:14.759]  It's the top link under that search.
[02:09:15.099 --> 02:09:17.479]  Two films that blew Bilderberg wide open.
[02:09:18.060 --> 02:09:20.660]  The public is now ready to be awakened to this.
[02:09:20.720 --> 02:09:26.082]  I noticed that Bilderberg Club, Bilderberg Group were the number three and number six search yesterday.
[02:09:27.298 --> 02:09:28.159]  Just on their own.
[02:09:29.560 --> 02:09:32.942]  And you've got all these world leaders talking about it in Time Magazine.
[02:09:33.422 --> 02:09:35.464]  Now people are ready to see what Bilderberg really is.
[02:09:35.484 --> 02:09:40.267]  So search the term, Bilderberg films, with an S. Great job, folks.
[02:09:40.287 --> 02:09:46.071]  You can also search, free Bilderberg films, as a separate search term, so we get a whole bunch of the top search terms.
[02:09:46.091 --> 02:09:48.132]  That'll really make them mad in the info war.
[02:09:48.713 --> 02:09:50.053]  Okay, going to Bob.
[02:09:50.154 --> 02:09:51.234]  Bob, you had just called in.
[02:09:51.254 --> 02:09:51.835]  We're on hold.
[02:09:52.435 --> 02:09:56.437]  While the guy was talking, I bleeped over to the network and said, is Bob there?
[02:09:56.457 --> 02:09:56.977]  And they said, yeah.
[02:09:56.997 --> 02:10:02.379]  So you obviously heard the guy's question about why would gold dealers sell gold?
[02:10:03.039 --> 02:10:05.320]  But I want to answer this my own way and then see what you say.
[02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:09.541]  Why would gold dealers sell gold for paper if it's worthless?
[02:10:09.641 --> 02:10:13.163]  And I'm not mad at the listener, but it's so elementary.
[02:10:14.397 --> 02:10:15.378]  That it frustrates me.
[02:10:15.618 --> 02:10:23.925]  I mean, let's say if I was a stockbroker and I had some gold that had gone from $265 an ounce eight years ago to $1,240 something today.
[02:10:25.266 --> 02:10:31.672]  Well, if I wanted to be a stockbroker and could spend the time doing that, and I'm not stupid, I learned how markets work, I could probably do okay.
[02:10:31.692 --> 02:10:38.057]  I mean, if you actually study the globalists, what they do rather than what their pundits say, it's a piece of cake, many experts have explained to me.
[02:10:38.758 --> 02:10:40.760]  But I could then
[02:10:42.210 --> 02:10:49.594]  Estimate and read the trade publications and figure out that there's going to be higher earnings, say, for Apple.
[02:10:50.554 --> 02:10:52.095]  And this is just speculation.
[02:10:52.135 --> 02:10:54.336]  I mean, or not even speculation.
[02:10:54.356 --> 02:10:56.017]  This is just a case point example.
[02:10:56.557 --> 02:10:58.878]  Or let's say the stock's going to go up in John Doe Company.
[02:10:59.418 --> 02:11:00.559]  You know, totally hypothetical.
[02:11:02.034 --> 02:11:09.444]  And then I could buy the stock knowing it was going up to make a profit and then get paper back from that and then go buy gold.
[02:11:09.865 --> 02:11:11.387]  What I'm saying is I physically
[02:11:12.318 --> 02:11:13.018]  Hold gold.
[02:11:14.159 --> 02:11:24.864]  And I have gold sponsor, Midas, and I take a little bit of that sponsor money that I end up getting, most of it, probably 95% goes into this operation, and I end up buying a few coins here and there every few months.
[02:11:25.664 --> 02:11:27.025]  Mainly silver, but some gold.
[02:11:27.465 --> 02:11:30.166]  So it's crazy to not understand this.
[02:11:30.186 --> 02:11:36.009]  We're in this fiat system, and so we exchange fiat for gold.
[02:11:36.849 --> 02:11:45.132]  But the way the gold broker makes money is, they're smart and buy gold when it's low, and then sell it when it's high, just like it's the stock market.
[02:11:45.392 --> 02:11:51.734]  But what Ted does, he isn't greedy, that's why he's grown so much, is he buys when it's low, knowing the...
[02:11:52.834 --> 02:11:53.474]  We're good to go.
[02:12:08.831 --> 02:12:09.171]  I'm speechless.
[02:12:38.413 --> 02:12:39.454]  You've done the whole thing.
[02:12:41.395 --> 02:12:42.896]  There's nothing for me to add.
[02:12:43.576 --> 02:12:51.682]  I was thinking of the extension of what does the dealer do with the money, that specie, that FDR, the Federal Reserve note.
[02:12:52.262 --> 02:13:07.192]  And you explain that, and he takes it, he buys more inventory, so he's back into gold and silver again, and then he puts money in his pocket for his salary and the salary of his employees, and they in turn spend the money within the economy because it's legal tender.
[02:13:07.822 --> 02:13:10.904]  And so, I think we've really, really covered it.
[02:13:19.226 --> 02:13:21.607]  Well this just shows you the propaganda arm
[02:13:49.764 --> 02:13:51.365]  That the major networks are.
[02:13:52.045 --> 02:13:53.446]  It's just as simple as that.
[02:13:53.526 --> 02:14:06.271]  It's just like the 95% truth and the 5% misdirection, propaganda, mind-blowing, mind-washing, brainwashing, and that's what it is.
[02:14:06.871 --> 02:14:11.173]  And that's what he's up to, and we've discussed this about others, including Glenn Beck.
[02:14:12.033 --> 02:14:18.116]  They mislead people, and the people say, well, gee, that must be right, because almost everything I heard him say
[02:14:18.607 --> 02:14:20.368]  Seemed okay and proper for me.
[02:14:20.868 --> 02:14:23.169]  So maybe he's telling us the truth about gold.
[02:14:23.489 --> 02:14:26.950]  I just saw the same thing on CNBC while I was waiting for you.
[02:14:27.750 --> 02:14:30.051]  They had a trader there attacking gold.
[02:14:31.672 --> 02:14:32.412]  Unbelievable!
[02:14:33.392 --> 02:14:37.914]  But you have to expect that because they're running scared.
[02:14:38.354 --> 02:14:42.216]  You talked earlier about the Bilderberger films.
[02:14:43.356 --> 02:14:43.816]  Okay.
[02:14:44.997 --> 02:14:45.937]  Fidel Castro
[02:14:46.661 --> 02:14:53.767]  Came out today, well maybe it was yesterday, but today I got the piece on it, and said the Build a Bigger Burger Group is bad!
[02:14:53.787 --> 02:14:59.292]  He didn't go into great detail, but he said he'd read Danny Esplin's book.
[02:15:00.093 --> 02:15:06.479]  Now unbeknownst to everybody out there, Fidel Castro is a subscriber to the International Forecaster.
[02:15:08.100 --> 02:15:08.861]  That's how he knows.
[02:15:13.032 --> 02:15:20.557]  Well, I'll tell ya, I don't like communists, but of all the communists out there, Fidel Castro's definitely been the one that the bankers don't like.
[02:15:21.017 --> 02:15:22.718]  It looks like he's the one that got away.
[02:15:22.738 --> 02:15:30.743]  I mean, it's admitted that they helped put him in power, then they wanted to use that as a pretext to invade and fully take over, and he got away from them.
[02:15:32.365 --> 02:15:39.169]  I think that's true, and I know for sure that how it all started out
[02:15:40.009 --> 02:15:53.862]  Was, and I don't know whether these were instructions from the Central Intelligence Agency or not, but I do know from the players themselves that the mob was the ones that financed him and got him his guns and etc.
[02:15:53.882 --> 02:15:54.362]  etc.
[02:15:54.843 --> 02:16:00.108]  because they were disturbed with Batista and they were being cheated out of their cut.
[02:16:01.088 --> 02:16:03.591]  And I get this straight from people who were involved.
[02:16:04.400 --> 02:16:06.721]  Well, it's been declassified partially.
[02:16:06.781 --> 02:16:07.341]  I don't know.
[02:16:07.361 --> 02:16:14.345]  I mean, it's been partially declassified that the West did help him get into power, and then he basically double-crossed them.
[02:16:16.666 --> 02:16:17.506]  Well, that's what they've said.
[02:16:17.546 --> 02:16:24.369]  We really don't know the innards, but it certainly wasn't the way it was presented.
[02:16:25.049 --> 02:16:28.911]  It's just like your commentary on 9-11 just a few minutes ago.
[02:16:29.732 --> 02:16:31.352]  Not the way it was presented.
[02:16:31.372 --> 02:16:31.953]  They're lying.
[02:16:32.013 --> 02:16:32.673]  They're all lying.
[02:16:33.772 --> 02:16:35.473]  And when you lie, you have something to cover up.
[02:16:35.513 --> 02:16:37.154]  You've done something that you shouldn't have done.
[02:16:39.436 --> 02:16:40.316]  Well said, Bob.
[02:16:40.336 --> 02:16:52.525]  I want to get into the latest economic developments and the mosque at Ground Zero and get your take on a bunch of issues and take some more calls, but briefly, we had a caller last hour who called in and he said, Alex, I'm confused.
[02:16:53.045 --> 02:16:59.890]  You got Bob Chapman on, and I could add Ron Paul, who promote gold-backed currency controlled by Congress, but then you promote
[02:17:00.848 --> 02:17:11.133]  Bill Still, who I really respect as well, The Secret of Oz, saying we could have a fiat currency that Congress controlled, like Abraham Lincoln and George Washington and others had.
[02:17:11.653 --> 02:17:14.675]  And I simply said, look, this is a college of ideas.
[02:17:14.715 --> 02:17:15.615]  We all want liberty.
[02:17:15.635 --> 02:17:16.516]  We all want freedom.
[02:17:16.756 --> 02:17:20.998]  We want to get rid of the Bernie Madoff, Ken Lay types that run the Federal Reserve.
[02:17:23.208 --> 02:17:27.729]  The point is, it's for the people and the Congress to decide what the monetary system is.
[02:17:27.849 --> 02:17:33.691]  But regardless, in this fiat system, you want to be in gold and silver because it can protect you more than anything else.
[02:17:34.471 --> 02:17:38.092]  So I just don't understand how people get confused by different ideas being put out here.
[02:17:38.132 --> 02:17:42.213]  But in a nutshell, in about two minutes, as we got a break, you've got the floor.
[02:17:42.754 --> 02:17:46.035]  What is your position on the monetary system that we should have?
[02:17:47.695 --> 02:17:50.796]  We should have a system where the United States government
[02:17:51.414 --> 02:17:54.975]  Issues currency that is backed by either gold or silver or both.
[02:17:55.776 --> 02:18:04.358]  And the reason why is, every time you have a fiat currency, the people within the system, particularly Wall Street and banking, abuse it.
[02:18:04.679 --> 02:18:05.319]  They're greedy.
[02:18:05.699 --> 02:18:07.519]  There's not enough power for them out there.
[02:18:08.320 --> 02:18:09.320]  They have to have more.
[02:18:09.720 --> 02:18:11.021]  They have to control people.
[02:18:11.381 --> 02:18:13.041]  They need a new world order.
[02:18:13.602 --> 02:18:14.982]  They need a one world government.
[02:18:15.322 --> 02:18:16.502]  And we don't need any of that.
[02:18:17.263 --> 02:18:17.883]  And if you make
[02:18:18.886 --> 02:18:24.808]  The currency, backed by gold in particular, and it doesn't have to be 100%, it can be 15 or 25%.
[02:18:25.329 --> 02:18:30.070]  I mean, when the Euro started out, it was 15%, it's down to about 7%.
[02:18:32.211 --> 02:18:45.236]  Now, when you issue money that is based on the history of monies that have been put out before, like U.S.
[02:18:45.336 --> 02:18:46.697]  notes, first of all,
[02:18:48.274 --> 02:18:54.879]  When they used Continentals during the late 1700s, they fell into disuse.
[02:18:55.799 --> 02:19:00.502]  There was a saying, as worthless as a Continental or something like that.
[02:19:00.983 --> 02:19:02.043]  It was unbacked money.
[02:19:02.564 --> 02:19:04.785]  And every time you have unbacked money, you get a problem.
[02:19:04.985 --> 02:19:08.468]  It caused a lot of instability, runs on banks, things like that.
[02:19:09.448 --> 02:19:13.071]  But it allowed the bankers, in this case the Federal Reserve,
[02:19:13.564 --> 02:19:16.128]  They issue as much money as they please.
[02:19:16.468 --> 02:19:21.054]  And you've just seen this in spades here in the last three years.
[02:19:21.135 --> 02:19:24.079]  And then they want to back it with your tax money to give it some value.
[02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:27.824]  And then you have to turn around and pay all the debt they created.
[02:19:29.608 --> 02:19:34.909]  Well, I tell all their inside friends what's going on, and they beat people to death in the stock market.
[02:19:35.109 --> 02:19:38.310]  Yeah, it's a very complex issue, and there's definitely two different ways to look at it.
[02:19:39.070 --> 02:19:43.211]  And I see your point, I respect Dr. Paul's point, I see Ben Still's point.
[02:19:43.251 --> 02:19:51.693]  If we had true transparency and control of our government, and a limited fiat currency, it'd be okay, but that money power always gets taken over by private interests.
[02:19:51.733 --> 02:19:57.755]  Finish up on that point, then phone calls, the economy, they're announcing they want to go out for Social Security, it's all coming up.
[02:20:00.319 --> 02:20:02.680]  Is your debt problem a ticking time bomb?
[02:20:02.940 --> 02:20:11.585]  Thanks to a new financial consumer relief program designed in response to the economic crisis facing millions of Americans, you don't have to wait until it's too late to defuse your debt.
[02:20:11.745 --> 02:20:21.990]  If you owe $10,000 or more in credit card bills and are struggling to make minimum payments, get ready to take down this number for free information that could potentially save your home the lifestyle you're accustomed to.
[02:20:22.270 --> 02:20:22.911]  I don't think so.
[02:20:45.373 --> 02:20:47.814]  You must have $10,000 in credit card debt.
[02:20:47.874 --> 02:20:49.755]  Call the American Debt Associates at 800-876-2966.
[02:20:49.775 --> 02:20:49.835]  800-876-2966.
[02:20:49.875 --> 02:20:50.036]  Again, 800-876-2966.
[02:20:50.056 --> 02:20:53.317]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:20:53.337 --> 02:20:53.778]  Number one.
[02:21:05.504 --> 02:21:09.507]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:21:09.787 --> 02:21:14.350]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:21:14.690 --> 02:21:15.131]  It's true.
[02:21:15.431 --> 02:21:20.854]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:21:21.115 --> 02:21:24.397]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:21:24.717 --> 02:21:28.880]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:21:29.420 --> 02:21:31.762]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:21:32.162 --> 02:21:40.128]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:21:40.188 --> 02:21:45.552]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:21:45.832 --> 02:21:49.875]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:21:50.015 --> 02:21:51.576]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:22:00.017 --> 02:22:03.040]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[02:22:03.400 --> 02:22:07.004]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[02:22:07.304 --> 02:22:10.767]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[02:22:11.027 --> 02:22:19.836]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants from municipal water.
[02:22:20.036 --> 02:22:21.357]  These filters are powerful and
[02:22:21.357 --> 02:22:21.857]  We're good to go.
[02:22:49.760 --> 02:22:54.743]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[02:22:54.923 --> 02:22:59.285]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today.
[02:23:01.126 --> 02:23:06.869]  The fall of America and the Western world is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[02:23:07.570 --> 02:23:11.972]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.
[02:23:12.831 --> 02:23:26.534]  Featuring Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Joseph Farah, David Icke, Naomi Wolfe, G. Edward Griffin, Doug McIntyre, Mark Crispin Miller, Mickey Z, Doug Casey, David McElhaney, and myself, Alex Jones.

[02:23:46.744 --> 02:23:48.846]  Prepare yourself and the ones you love today.
[02:23:48.886 --> 02:23:49.767]  Fallofamerica.net.
[02:24:02.628 --> 02:24:08.651]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:24:09.251 --> 02:24:12.273]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:19.756 --> 02:24:21.637]  Okay, Bob, you got interrupted by the break there.
[02:24:21.657 --> 02:24:24.359]  Did you have anything else to add about monetary policy?
[02:24:26.553 --> 02:24:48.099]  The issue is, and I agree with you, if you have a fiat currency, it's open for manipulation and history always is, but Bill Still and others point about the money changers in Europe in the Middle Ages developing their original fraud system with gold, but those were receipts on gold, so maybe you should explain that to people.
[02:24:48.119 --> 02:24:51.080]  So it's like, darned if you do, darned if you don't.
[02:24:52.714 --> 02:24:59.297]  Well, I think you can stop that by not having a fractional banking system and banks lending from what they have.
[02:25:00.077 --> 02:25:05.979]  And if government wants more money in circulation, they can do that if there's no Federal Reserve.
[02:25:07.240 --> 02:25:13.122]  So they can create money in credit if they want to, being backed by the currency itself.
[02:25:13.772 --> 02:25:15.594]  So the currency is not leveraged.
[02:25:16.094 --> 02:25:17.516]  It's the government that's leveraged.
[02:25:17.836 --> 02:25:19.017]  Well, I agree with Ron Paul.
[02:25:19.197 --> 02:25:20.479]  And I want to see what you say about this.
[02:25:21.019 --> 02:25:22.421]  I think it should be a free-for-all.
[02:25:23.262 --> 02:25:26.345]  Any companies, anybody they want can issue whatever they want.
[02:25:26.785 --> 02:25:27.986]  Junk bonds, you name it.
[02:25:28.227 --> 02:25:29.808]  But it's not going to be government-backed.
[02:25:30.249 --> 02:25:35.674]  And if you cheat people, you're going to be civilly and criminally responsible to the grand juries of the states.
[02:25:35.694 --> 02:25:36.395]  And then you'll have
[02:25:36.775 --> 02:25:40.657]  Well, that's another way of handling it, and it's a good way.
[02:25:40.737 --> 02:25:44.300]  We had that going on in America, but the bankers were too powerful.
[02:26:02.054 --> 02:26:06.795]  And the state specie disappeared.
[02:26:07.815 --> 02:26:10.256]  And the state used to issue their own currencies.
[02:26:11.156 --> 02:26:13.456]  And it can be a combination of things.
[02:26:14.837 --> 02:26:19.538]  And as far as currency backing is concerned, it does not have to be gold or silver.
[02:26:19.998 --> 02:26:21.638]  It could be a basket of commodities.
[02:26:23.798 --> 02:26:24.819]  So that's another thought.
[02:26:24.919 --> 02:26:28.779]  People have put that idea forward over the years.
[02:26:29.540 --> 02:26:31.500]  And so there's more ways to approach it.
[02:26:32.179 --> 02:26:50.904]  So, if we're going to do something along those lines, we'll have a Congress discuss what they want to do, and input from the American people, and hopefully what they will come up with will be very workable, but take the power out of the hands of the Federal Reserve, its owners, the bankers, and Wall Street.
[02:26:53.018 --> 02:26:53.839]  Good point, Bob.
[02:26:53.879 --> 02:27:01.244]  I want to come back and take calls and get into some other news, but on your radar screen, since we talked last Friday, what is most pressing right now?
[02:27:01.324 --> 02:27:03.325]  For me, it's the Wall Street Journal.
[02:27:03.385 --> 02:27:11.550]  Social Security cuts weighed by panel, and if you read the article, basically they're getting ready to raise the retirement age and cut payments with the inflation that's going on.
[02:27:11.611 --> 02:27:12.871]  Boy, this is going to make folks angry.
[02:27:14.292 --> 02:27:20.977]  It surely is, and I can see them raising the retirement age, but I certainly don't think that they
[02:27:21.576 --> 02:27:24.737]  Should cut back because they spent all the money.
[02:27:25.217 --> 02:27:25.897]  And that started in 1935.
[02:27:26.137 --> 02:27:29.198]  The money has never been there.
[02:27:29.218 --> 02:27:30.759]  They issued bonds which are worthless.
[02:27:31.639 --> 02:27:38.601]  And the bonds sit in some file cabinet someplace in Cincinnati and there's a couple of repositories for them.
[02:27:39.282 --> 02:27:43.363]  But, you know, it was an exercise in nothing.
[02:27:44.123 --> 02:27:45.143]  I mean, they created nothing.
[02:27:45.163 --> 02:27:46.624]  They just took all the money and spent it.
[02:27:47.144 --> 02:27:49.985]  So, you know, it was designed
[02:27:50.640 --> 02:27:54.062]  It's a social security system, but in fact was really a tax.
[02:27:54.683 --> 02:27:58.105]  And the question is, is the other people going to put up with it?
[02:27:58.365 --> 02:27:59.546]  And they can't put up with it.
[02:28:00.126 --> 02:28:13.034]  I mean, there's probably 60-70% of the population, we'll say over 67, now is totally dependent on their social security check.
[02:28:13.974 --> 02:28:14.855]  And what are we going to do?
[02:28:15.916 --> 02:28:18.077]  Have millions of people dying of starvation?
[02:28:20.996 --> 02:28:26.938]  No, they're going to raise taxes on the productive people, steal most the money, and then give a pittance to the old folks.
[02:28:28.719 --> 02:28:39.523]  Well, as you saw, they have frozen the COLA on Social Security for three years.
[02:28:40.783 --> 02:28:46.145]  Now it's two more years it was frozen during this year, so we'll assume this year is relatively over.
[02:28:46.285 --> 02:28:48.906]  And for those that don't know, COLA is cost of living increase.
[02:28:50.478 --> 02:29:08.029]  And it's also used in private pensions, and government pensions, state pensions, and it's very, very misleading, because it comes from the CPI figures, and, uh, these CPI figures are so doctored, they're meaningless.
[02:29:08.809 --> 02:29:14.533]  I mean, right now they're talking about a half a percent or one percent inflation, when it's over seven percent.
[02:29:14.593 --> 02:29:17.855]  John Williams says it's eight and a quarter, and he's probably right.
[02:29:18.836 --> 02:29:19.456]  And so, you know,
[02:29:20.583 --> 02:29:25.666]  The people on Social Security and other pensions have been getting screwed for a long time.
[02:29:26.346 --> 02:29:28.968]  Bob, when we come back, I want to get into what's on your mind.
[02:29:29.008 --> 02:29:30.469]  I brought up the points I wanted to raise.
[02:29:30.489 --> 02:29:31.589]  Then we'll take some phone calls.
[02:29:31.609 --> 02:29:35.612]  We've got a video clip coming up, and you'll be able to comment on that as well.
[02:29:35.932 --> 02:29:38.854]  Bob Chapman's our guest at TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:29:39.114 --> 02:29:41.555]  We'll tell you how to get a free copy of it before he leaves.
[02:29:41.895 --> 02:29:43.496]  It's invaluable information.
[02:29:43.536 --> 02:29:46.198]  If he says Fidel Castro's a subscriber, I believe him.
[02:29:50.114 --> 02:29:53.095]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.035 --> 02:29:56.776]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.497 --> 02:30:03.478]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:30:03.718 --> 02:30:09.740]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:30:10.121 --> 02:30:14.462]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much
[02:30:14.462 --> 02:30:14.862]  I think so.
[02:30:35.290 --> 02:30:41.473]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:30:42.053 --> 02:30:45.475]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[02:30:52.319 --> 02:30:53.519]  Thank you.
[02:31:01.087 --> 02:31:04.708]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:05.048 --> 02:31:13.169]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:31:13.909 --> 02:31:17.950]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:31:18.530 --> 02:31:29.352]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:31:29.992 --> 02:31:38.995]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:39.495 --> 02:31:44.557]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:31:44.937 --> 02:31:52.100]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:52.420 --> 02:31:54.821]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:31:58.953 --> 02:32:03.176]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:03.497 --> 02:32:03.777]  Number 1.
[02:32:04.417 --> 02:32:07.560]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:07.840 --> 02:32:08.400]  Number 2.
[02:32:08.701 --> 02:32:13.244]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:13.584 --> 02:32:14.025]  It's true.
[02:32:14.325 --> 02:32:18.888]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:19.209 --> 02:32:19.749]  Number 3.
[02:32:20.029 --> 02:32:23.312]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:23.612 --> 02:32:27.315]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:27.515 --> 02:32:28.056]  Number 4.
[02:32:28.316 --> 02:32:30.678]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:31.079 --> 02:32:34.462]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:34.763 --> 02:32:34.963]  Number 5.
[02:32:35.543 --> 02:32:39.468]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:39.688 --> 02:32:44.453]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:44.733 --> 02:32:48.758]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:48.918 --> 02:32:50.460]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:50.700 --> 02:32:52.783]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:32:52.943 --> 02:32:55.306]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:33:07.916 --> 02:33:14.189]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:33.331 --> 02:33:34.872]  Alright, going back to Bob Chapman.
[02:33:35.413 --> 02:33:39.096]  Bob, I wanted to get your take on the mosque.
[02:33:39.116 --> 02:33:45.902]  We've got a key report up at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com where Steve Watson really did deep research.
[02:33:46.363 --> 02:33:53.949]  This guy's definitely a top globalist stooge and this looks like this whole thing was contrived as a way to
[02:33:54.770 --> 02:34:04.216]  At a primitive level, make Americans feel like, you know, the evil Muslims at Stage 9-11, you know, quote, have revisited the scene and we need to hit Iran.
[02:34:05.176 --> 02:34:07.918]  Just hyping this Islamophobia.
[02:34:08.398 --> 02:34:09.219]  What's your view on it?
[02:34:10.279 --> 02:34:11.220]  Exactly the same.
[02:34:12.100 --> 02:34:23.227]  And I think that it's also, from a social viewpoint, designed to drive a wedge between the Muslim and the non-Muslim community.
[02:34:24.173 --> 02:34:31.118]  And yes, there are some things that they're asking for or demanding that are unreasonable.
[02:34:31.539 --> 02:34:34.421]  On the other hand, other religions do the same thing.
[02:34:35.101 --> 02:34:46.149]  And so, there's no question in my mind it was set up to be another reason why we should be in Iran killing people.
[02:34:49.052 --> 02:34:50.553]  So where do you see it going, Bob?
[02:34:51.854 --> 02:34:53.435]  I don't think it's going to go much of anywhere.
[02:34:53.891 --> 02:34:57.274]  I think a lot of people realize what they're up to.
[02:34:58.115 --> 02:35:13.808]  People are getting more and more sophisticated because they're listening to these radio programs and reading the internet, and they're getting a much different view than they had previously in things that they've been presented by the mainline media, if you may.
[02:35:14.509 --> 02:35:17.591]  And so they're taking a second look.
[02:35:18.112 --> 02:35:20.634]  And I think the situation was aggravated
[02:35:22.028 --> 02:35:29.092]  By all the different comments that were made, and that's it for the people who set this whole thing up in the first place.
[02:35:29.632 --> 02:35:33.415]  Another reason to go and start a war against Iran.
[02:35:35.036 --> 02:35:45.021]  Bob, I want to take a few calls and get into the economy with you and give folks the toll-free number to get a free hard copy or digital copy of the International Forecaster, 30, 40 pages, several times a week, and valuable intel.
[02:35:45.362 --> 02:35:51.005]  But briefly, any other key news on the economy or the Iran front that you want to comment on?
[02:35:52.182 --> 02:36:12.928]  Well, as we broke the story six or seven weeks ago here, when nobody else did, I said that the Fed Reserve, because the Congress wouldn't allocate any more stimulus money, would spend probably five trillion dollars over the next two years taking the economy sideways, because if they didn't, the whole thing would collapse.
[02:36:13.569 --> 02:36:14.869]  And it's turning out that way.
[02:36:15.529 --> 02:36:17.650]  They've already admitted that they're going to go in and
[02:36:18.397 --> 02:36:44.129]  uh... by uh... treasuries as well as agencies the agencies of the bonds of fannie freddie uh... jenny and f h a and uh... they're going to be doing a lot of other things that they're not going to tell you about uh... because they don't tell the truth either and if you ask uh... they say that uh... it's secret and uh... and uh... did the united states government doesn't have to tell you that and they make like they're part of the government
[02:36:44.770 --> 02:37:04.558]  I thought it was interesting, and this is just aside to that whole thing, Timothy Geithner, the Treasury Secretary, has been told that he was a former member of Goldman Sachs.
[02:37:05.419 --> 02:37:07.379]  And so now he swears up and down he wasn't.
[02:37:08.280 --> 02:37:13.262]  But when asked what he was doing during that period when he was supposed to be with Goldman,
[02:37:14.139 --> 02:37:19.563]  And the reason it's brought up is Goldman's a revolving door for the Treasury and other departments in government.
[02:37:21.445 --> 02:37:25.148]  He was working for Henry Kissinger, which is probably worse.
[02:37:26.269 --> 02:37:27.990]  I mean, these people are dumber than dumb.
[02:37:28.351 --> 02:37:31.273]  I mean, they must think we don't know anything out here.
[02:37:32.554 --> 02:37:40.260]  But anyway, we see lots of, you know, inflation coming because they're going to have to pump like mad.
[02:37:41.301 --> 02:37:43.543]  Europe's gone in the opposite direction for the moment.
[02:37:44.661 --> 02:37:49.625]  They're going to find out that once the Euro stabilizes that they're going to have problems.
[02:37:50.365 --> 02:37:53.187]  And I do expect more problems in Greece.
[02:37:54.088 --> 02:38:00.173]  I have a conglomeration of information in tomorrow's issue on Greece.
[02:38:01.293 --> 02:38:04.576]  I think we're probably several weeks away from rioting.
[02:38:05.476 --> 02:38:09.619]  Maybe even next week, next month, which is like two weeks away.
[02:38:10.320 --> 02:38:13.342]  And the reason why is lots and lots of people are going to get laid off.
[02:38:13.954 --> 02:38:18.157]  In Permian and in Piraeus, unemployment 70%.
[02:38:18.397 --> 02:38:21.039]  I mean, it's astronomical.
[02:38:21.580 --> 02:38:25.082]  And they've done everything wrong, but it was done wrong deliberately.
[02:38:25.202 --> 02:38:26.403]  And that's the globalists!
[02:38:26.443 --> 02:38:28.945]  I mean, this is what they're going to do here if we let them get away with it.
[02:38:30.026 --> 02:38:31.747]  Yeah, who's running the country?
[02:38:32.107 --> 02:38:33.949]  Prime Minister Papandreou.
[02:38:34.349 --> 02:38:34.789]  Who is he?
[02:38:34.809 --> 02:38:37.211]  He's a Bilderberger and he's an aluminist.
[02:38:38.152 --> 02:38:39.873]  And so they want to take the country down.
[02:38:39.933 --> 02:38:41.234]  And this is to proving Brown.
[02:38:41.886 --> 02:38:44.611]  And I have an article for next Wednesday I'm doing now.
[02:38:45.212 --> 02:38:55.809]  Just like Spain was a proving ground for the Nazis during the late 1930s during the Civil War, Greece is going to be a proving ground for what they want to do to everybody else.
[02:38:58.266 --> 02:38:59.147]  Well said, Bob.
[02:38:59.827 --> 02:39:04.291]  I need to play this six-minute clip, because I promised to do it, and I want to have you come back and comment on it.
[02:39:04.591 --> 02:39:13.679]  And then in the last segment, I want to ask you a few other key economic questions and give folks the toll-free number to get a free copy of The International Forecaster, or just go to theinternationalforecaster.com.
[02:39:14.059 --> 02:39:18.523]  But I want to jam in five calls quickly, right now, before we play this clip.
[02:39:18.563 --> 02:39:20.265]  So, callers, please have a question and comment ready.
[02:39:20.505 --> 02:39:22.226]  We want to hear from you, but we've got limited time.
[02:39:22.587 --> 02:39:25.189]  Frank in Florida, you're on the air with Bob Chapman and Alex Jones.
[02:39:27.674 --> 02:39:30.596]  Oh, I already called him before, but uh... I didn't know that.
[02:39:30.616 --> 02:39:31.637]  I'll let you go then, Frank.
[02:39:32.337 --> 02:39:33.338]  That's who was on hold there.
[02:39:33.678 --> 02:39:34.038]  Sorry.
[02:39:34.619 --> 02:39:35.939]  Michael in South Carolina.
[02:39:35.999 --> 02:39:36.900]  Michael, you're on the air.
[02:39:36.920 --> 02:39:39.201]  Or Michelle.
[02:39:39.262 --> 02:39:40.823]  I can't get anything straight today.
[02:39:41.943 --> 02:39:42.484]  Hi, Alex.
[02:39:42.544 --> 02:39:44.485]  You're my knight in shining armor.
[02:39:44.665 --> 02:39:47.627]  You're a hero and stay healthy for us.
[02:39:47.687 --> 02:39:48.207]  We need you.
[02:39:49.668 --> 02:39:56.793]  Regarding Mr. Chapman, for people that live paycheck to paycheck and can't afford to
[02:39:57.751 --> 02:40:00.273]  Buy gold and so on and so forth.
[02:40:00.613 --> 02:40:08.137]  What would Mr. Chapman say to them regarding preparing themselves for the coming crisis?
[02:40:09.318 --> 02:40:21.766]  And on something, I want to touch on something that you were talking about earlier when you were talking about, just briefly about, you know, help me out here, Empire, your movie.
[02:40:24.744 --> 02:40:25.344]  Invisible Empire?
[02:40:25.384 --> 02:40:28.667]  Invisible Empire speech by James Jones of the NSA.
[02:40:30.348 --> 02:40:40.315]  I tried to link that speech to some people on YouTube that were arguing with me about that and it was blocked off of Facebook.
[02:40:40.475 --> 02:40:49.641]  There was a mention in that at the end of the article where Mr. Jones said that his top priority above terrorism above everything else was going to be
[02:40:50.265 --> 02:40:51.746]  Cyber security.
[02:40:51.866 --> 02:40:53.268]  Yeah, that's taking the web over.
[02:40:53.988 --> 02:40:55.950]  Bob Chapman, any comments on what Michelle's saying?
[02:40:57.731 --> 02:40:57.932]  No.
[02:40:58.312 --> 02:41:02.195]  No, I'm not up to speed on what she's talking about.
[02:41:02.215 --> 02:41:05.138]  But she's also asking, what can somebody paycheck to paycheck do?
[02:41:06.039 --> 02:41:08.040]  Well, I can answer that very, very quickly.
[02:41:09.101 --> 02:41:16.988]  You should put away canned goods that you normally use and rotate them so that you have an inventory of things to eat
[02:41:17.481 --> 02:41:19.043]  In case things get difficult.
[02:41:19.443 --> 02:41:24.909]  If you can afford to, buy dehydrated and freeze-dried foods, and get a water filter.
[02:41:24.949 --> 02:41:25.910]  It's very important.
[02:41:26.490 --> 02:41:32.997]  And of course, hopefully in your household, you have some sort of device that you can defend your family with.
[02:41:33.695 --> 02:41:37.919]  And those are the fundamental, most important things that you can do.
[02:41:38.399 --> 02:41:42.603]  And people all over the country are doing it, and particularly people in Florida.
[02:41:42.883 --> 02:41:46.786]  Yeah, that way you're not dependent on the system if it implodes.
[02:41:48.047 --> 02:41:49.629]  Michelle, God bless you, thanks for calling.
[02:41:49.929 --> 02:41:52.271]  Let's talk to Joe in Michigan.
[02:41:52.311 --> 02:41:53.052]  Joe, you're on the air.
[02:41:53.072 --> 02:41:58.296]  Hey Alex, I've got one quick comment about economy and money and stuff.
[02:41:58.376 --> 02:41:59.377]  I had one question.
[02:42:00.799 --> 02:42:07.783]  As far as the economy and what's valuable, probably the only valuable asset, commodity on the whole planet is people.
[02:42:08.524 --> 02:42:09.504]  And that's my opinion.
[02:42:10.165 --> 02:42:14.908]  And whatever has control over the money has control over the people, we already know that.
[02:42:15.948 --> 02:42:20.011]  But my question was, are you a United States citizen?
[02:42:20.031 --> 02:42:22.913]  Either, both you and Bob.
[02:42:23.689 --> 02:42:25.850]  Well, I mean, I was born in this country.
[02:42:25.870 --> 02:42:26.611]  I'm an American.
[02:42:26.651 --> 02:42:27.851]  I believe in our Republic.
[02:42:28.371 --> 02:42:31.213]  And you can argue, are you a state citizen or a federal citizen?
[02:42:31.413 --> 02:42:35.895]  I am a citizen of my state, which then created the federal government.
[02:42:36.716 --> 02:42:40.137]  But according to the federal definitions, I would be one of their U.S.
[02:42:40.177 --> 02:42:40.658]  citizens.
[02:42:42.859 --> 02:42:43.259]  A U.S.
[02:42:43.359 --> 02:42:44.440]  citizen has no rights.
[02:42:44.680 --> 02:42:46.421]  American has all the rights.
[02:42:49.375 --> 02:42:50.516]  You always have a good answer, though.
[02:42:51.296 --> 02:42:51.677]  That was it.
[02:42:51.757 --> 02:42:52.137]  Thank you.
[02:42:52.577 --> 02:42:53.718]  Joe, I appreciate your call.
[02:42:53.758 --> 02:42:59.402]  Bob, briefly, the globalists don't care who you are or where you are or what you claim you are.
[02:42:59.723 --> 02:43:01.624]  They're coming in with tyranny to oppress you.
[02:43:01.924 --> 02:43:08.529]  We've got to take our government back to block them from using the leverage and the mechanisms of government to engage in their raping.
[02:43:11.611 --> 02:43:12.292]  Without question.
[02:43:15.299 --> 02:43:17.240]  Well, that was a brief response to it, Bob.
[02:43:18.220 --> 02:43:22.502]  Let's jam one more call, and then I've got to quickly go to this video clip so we have time to play it.
[02:43:23.602 --> 02:43:29.264]  This missing MSNBC video where they interviewed me, and it's now serviced on the web.
[02:43:29.284 --> 02:43:33.326]  We don't know where it came from, but this is what didn't make it in the TV show, what I really said.
[02:43:33.886 --> 02:43:35.427]  Quickly, Billy in Vegas.
[02:43:35.447 --> 02:43:36.547]  Quick comment or question.
[02:43:37.708 --> 02:43:38.268]  Hello, Alex.
[02:43:38.388 --> 02:43:40.289]  Yeah, I just want to let you know what's happening here in Vegas.
[02:43:40.689 --> 02:43:43.390]  And excuse me, I'm making sandwiches in my sub shop while I'm talking to you.
[02:43:43.976 --> 02:43:48.278]  But we had a 9-11 Truth meet-up group about six months ago.
[02:43:48.318 --> 02:43:52.660]  We dropped the ball and some guy came in, took it over the website.
[02:43:52.720 --> 02:43:55.501]  No one ever heard of him, no one ever saw him, never came to a meeting.
[02:43:56.161 --> 02:44:00.983]  And right away he puts up, he's there to make sure that no one falls for conspiracy theories.
[02:44:01.463 --> 02:44:03.204]  Yeah, that happened in Austin.
[02:44:03.264 --> 02:44:07.366]  They send operatives in to try to take over the 9-11 Truth group.
[02:44:07.406 --> 02:44:10.587]  So just go start a new website, a new group, and don't fall for it again.
[02:44:11.462 --> 02:44:11.862]  No, I didn't.
[02:44:11.882 --> 02:44:25.830]  Listen, I wrote out an idea to everybody, and it says, Dear 9-11 Truth member, it is apparent to me and others that Matt, Chris, and Blur are guardians and protectors of the government's official conspiracy theory and lie, as these traitors... Listen, I gotta let you go.
[02:44:25.850 --> 02:44:29.052]  I don't know about these local issues, so I can't confirm what you're saying.
[02:44:29.332 --> 02:44:31.053]  Here is the video clip.
[02:44:31.273 --> 02:44:32.754]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:44:32.794 --> 02:44:34.695]  In full, we'll come back with Bob Chapman.
[02:44:34.715 --> 02:44:35.116]  Stay with us.
[02:44:35.996 --> 02:44:51.404]  As an aggressive constitutionalist, that means that I believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, liberty and freedom and justice, and I've studied history, I've studied the writings of the Founding Fathers, and it's clear you need to aggressively defend liberty and freedom or you'll lose it.
[02:44:51.504 --> 02:44:54.865]  I mean, how many times did George Washington and Thomas Jefferson say that?
[02:44:55.285 --> 02:44:58.907]  And so that's why I describe myself as an aggressive constitutionalist.
[02:44:59.788 --> 02:45:03.990]  People try to describe me as a libertarian, and I do agree with a lot of libertarian ideas and thoughts.
[02:45:05.170 --> 02:45:10.634]  But again, that is another label that the media can twist and stereotype.
[02:45:11.255 --> 02:45:18.119]  I really am somebody who believes in limited government, private property, and freedom, and the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:45:18.179 --> 02:45:24.123]  So that's why I describe myself as an aggressive constitutionalist, is because I aggressively defend the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:45:24.724 --> 02:45:29.047]  Because as Barry Goldwater said, extremism and defense of liberty is no vice.
[02:45:29.567 --> 02:45:32.269]  My entire work is about shattering the left-right paradigm.
[02:45:34.096 --> 02:45:36.357]  A hundred and fifty years ago, people didn't talk about left or right.
[02:45:36.377 --> 02:45:47.381]  They talked about freedom versus tyranny, and tyranny in all its forms, and how the people, as populist, need to take control of their own destiny by controlling their governments.
[02:45:48.102 --> 02:45:50.623]  And so I describe myself as a follower of the Magna Carta.
[02:45:51.323 --> 02:45:53.925]  The Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, and the Constitution.
[02:45:54.485 --> 02:46:05.512]  The left-right system is a way to artificially divide the people and play them off against each other, while the real power structure continues on with their policies of world government.
[02:46:06.093 --> 02:46:19.321]  And so I'm against the global corporate state, known as the New World Order, that has been set up that uses the left-right paradigm to control the population, to keep the population from ever really having a serious debate
[02:46:21.129 --> 02:46:23.150]  It's the people versus the power structure.
[02:46:23.190 --> 02:46:24.731]  It's been like that throughout history.
[02:46:25.332 --> 02:46:41.863]  So that's how I describe myself, is someone trying to get the people to open up their minds, to get outside the box, to get outside the whole left-right debate, and really look at the power structure in America and worldwide, and the systemic, continued loss of freedom that we see happening.
[02:46:42.343 --> 02:46:46.486]  So I don't describe myself as a right-winger or as a left-winger.
[02:46:47.895 --> 02:46:49.136]  Big government enslaves.
[02:46:49.517 --> 02:46:50.738]  Big government destroys.
[02:46:51.459 --> 02:46:54.062]  And big government annihilates the individual.
[02:46:54.583 --> 02:46:57.827]  I mean, even with a small government, it's hard for the individual to have liberty and freedom.
[02:46:57.847 --> 02:47:00.270]  But if you have a big government, history is conclusive.
[02:47:00.690 --> 02:47:04.435]  It always tramples on the weak and empowers the strong.
[02:47:04.955 --> 02:47:19.302]  The general public was told, none of this exists, just go to sleep, stand down, let the experts run things, nobody's going to take your sovereignty, nobody wants your guns, you know, nobody wants socialism, which is what the big banks want because they get the lion's share of the money.
[02:47:20.062 --> 02:47:23.704]  And then I would actually read the publications put out by the establishment,
[02:47:24.693 --> 02:47:25.334]  To each other.
[02:47:26.335 --> 02:47:29.538]  It wasn't secret, but it was academic, and it was all admitted.
[02:47:30.339 --> 02:47:32.301]  And so I said, whoa, there's something going on here.
[02:47:32.641 --> 02:47:33.883]  I better learn more about this.
[02:47:34.443 --> 02:47:36.085]  The United States has been turned into an engine.
[02:47:37.185 --> 02:47:55.412]  of global corporate tyranny and the people see right through it and they know that their paychecks don't go as far they know they're losing their jobs or getting their hours cut or they're working two or three jobs and they know everywhere they go there's new fines and fees and regulations and more police squeezing them and more rules and they know they're being socially engineered into slaves
[02:47:56.297 --> 02:47:58.238]  And they also know the GMO foods killing them.
[02:47:58.258 --> 02:48:00.879]  They know the chemicals they put in the water are killing them.
[02:48:01.199 --> 02:48:03.560]  They know their neighbors are getting sick and dying all around them.
[02:48:04.040 --> 02:48:07.101]  People know we're in a huge eugenics system and they know we're being killed.
[02:48:08.301 --> 02:48:11.763]  The Democrats and Republicans are teamed up together at the leadership levels.
[02:48:12.865 --> 02:48:13.645]  Sharing power.
[02:48:14.126 --> 02:48:21.648]  They do fight with each other over who gets to have the levers of power, but they don't fight with each other over their overall agenda of corporate looting and raping.
[02:48:22.028 --> 02:48:23.229]  And they work for the same interest.
[02:48:23.669 --> 02:48:40.775]  And so Republicans are playing the part of anti-establishment right now, but as soon as they get into office, the banker bailouts will continue, the Patriot Act will continue, the corporate welfare will continue, the entire agenda will continue, just like Obama broke all of his promises, because they're all bought and paid for by the same people.
[02:48:42.352 --> 02:48:46.835]  One of the most common questions I get is, are we inevitably headed towards armed revolution?
[02:48:47.896 --> 02:48:59.865]  And my answer is, I certainly hope not, and that's why I'm fighting as hard as I can to educate the public about how they're being manipulated by the false left-right paradigm.
[02:49:00.445 --> 02:49:02.347]  But if we are unable to
[02:49:05.669 --> 02:49:14.593]  To get the government to back off and to convince special interests to take their foot off the gas of tyranny and oppression.
[02:49:15.374 --> 02:49:16.254]  It's going to explode.
[02:49:16.754 --> 02:49:27.880]  And the system, from all their preparations and all their statements, actually wants it to become violent and wants to use that as the excuse to clamp down and have a real police state in America.
[02:49:28.520 --> 02:49:29.621]  And so, no, I don't
[02:49:32.441 --> 02:49:46.910]  I don't want armed conflict in this country and I unfortunately think it's probably going to come to that because the system wants that and the system's been caught provocateuring and supporting and promoting groups that do do that.
[02:49:48.402 --> 02:49:53.584]  I support the militia movement, the real militia movement that is in the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[02:49:54.104 --> 02:50:01.167]  And most of the militias that are out there are really good, hard-working people who are concerned about the government and realize the tyrannical threat.
[02:50:01.907 --> 02:50:09.390]  And a lot of them are former military who are ready and willing to defend their families, just like the Founding Fathers in 1776 were.
[02:50:10.630 --> 02:50:12.171]  They're also some colorful people.
[02:50:12.831 --> 02:50:18.736]  And some unstable people out there, strutting around in uniforms, and there are some extremist, you know, nut jobs out there.
[02:50:19.097 --> 02:50:36.071]  But nine times out of ten, when you actually study one of those groups, it's founded and run by feds, who are not just infiltrating a group, they go out and create them, and try to get them to do something radical, so that they can then demonize the general movement of citizens being armed.
[02:50:36.111 --> 02:50:37.652]  So I, I a hundred and...
[02:50:38.513 --> 02:50:43.459]  I support the militia 100% because it's in the Constitution, it's in the Bill of Rights, it's the Second Amendment.
[02:50:44.240 --> 02:50:52.550]  But the media has created a distorted image of what the militia is so that they can try to demonize the entire idea.
[02:51:00.023 --> 02:51:00.503]  Attention!
[02:51:00.623 --> 02:51:05.525]  This is a special alert to all Americans who owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS.
[02:51:05.625 --> 02:51:11.167]  The IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from people who owe back taxes and dramatically lowering amounts owed.
[02:51:11.307 --> 02:51:18.269]  Due to the financial crisis in America, the IRS has announced a leniency plan in recognition of consumers' financial troubles in today's economy.
[02:51:18.470 --> 02:51:27.213]  If you owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, an open phone line has been established by American Tax Settlement for you to call and see if you qualify for a reduction by up to 75%.
[02:51:28.433 --> 02:51:31.335]  Number to call is 800-902-6969.
[02:51:31.575 --> 02:51:38.218]  Again, the IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from consumers who owe back taxes in response to the decline in today's economy.
[02:51:38.398 --> 02:51:47.223]  If you are struggling with $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, you now may be eligible for a dramatic reduction by up to 75% and save thousands of dollars.
[02:51:47.363 --> 02:51:51.985]  For free information and to see if you qualify, call the open phone line into American Tax Settlement now.
[02:51:52.125 --> 02:51:52.466]  800-902-6969 800-902-6969 Again 800-902-6969
[02:52:00.202 --> 02:52:05.066]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:52:05.166 --> 02:52:05.946]  What have we got?
[02:52:06.166 --> 02:52:08.288]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:52:08.628 --> 02:52:09.369]  A republic.
[02:52:09.629 --> 02:52:12.211]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:52:12.271 --> 02:52:14.192]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:52:14.533 --> 02:52:16.434]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:52:16.554 --> 02:52:17.835]  So they think they own our land?
[02:52:18.255 --> 02:52:19.356]  They think they own our water?
[02:52:19.556 --> 02:52:19.957]  Children?
[02:52:20.177 --> 02:52:20.957]  Our education?
[02:52:21.298 --> 02:52:21.918]  Our money?
[02:52:22.118 --> 02:52:25.781]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:52:26.141 --> 02:52:30.787]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:52:31.107 --> 02:52:31.928]  We have the facts.
[02:52:32.128 --> 02:52:33.249]  We have the Constitution.
[02:52:33.289 --> 02:52:34.171]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:52:34.191 --> 02:52:35.032]  We have common law.
[02:52:35.092 --> 02:52:37.334]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:37.615 --> 02:52:41.379]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:52:41.479 --> 02:52:46.284]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:52:46.444 --> 02:52:47.826]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:52:47.946 --> 02:52:48.787]  Don't tread on me.
[02:52:49.027 --> 02:52:55.914]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:53:00.313 --> 02:53:01.854]  No one likes foreclosure.
[02:53:02.155 --> 02:53:06.818]  You won't stay, think, or even consider foreclosure with ZerodetGuaranteed.com.
[02:53:07.058 --> 02:53:07.319]  Why?
[02:53:07.519 --> 02:53:15.845]  Because ZerodetGuaranteed.com guarantees to stop your foreclosure for at least two years with no payments, no bankruptcy, and no negotiating.
[02:53:16.026 --> 02:53:17.227]  Thinking loan modification?
[02:53:17.447 --> 02:53:18.888]  That still keeps you in default.
[02:53:19.148 --> 02:53:27.655]  Zerodet in 90 days is the only proven system that keeps you in your house for as long as you want to stay, while making it possible to even get clear title to your house.
[02:53:27.975 --> 02:53:31.178]  No, we are not investors, bankers, attorneys, or real estate agents.
[02:53:31.378 --> 02:53:38.405]  We are a group of people just like you that are sick and tired of the housing crash, and we've helped thousands avoid foreclosure since 1993.

[02:53:47.033 --> 02:53:47.313]  That's 800-477-9256.
[02:53:47.394 --> 02:53:48.194]  Or visit ZeroDebtGuaranteed.com.
[02:53:48.214 --> 02:53:49.095]  Guaranteed to stop foreclosure.
[02:54:05.472 --> 02:54:08.594]  Well, unfortunately, it's the final segment with Bob Chapman.
[02:54:08.634 --> 02:54:11.755]  I tried to get to all your calls, and we covered most of the news today.
[02:54:11.775 --> 02:54:15.617]  I wanted to hit a few other key economic issues here.
[02:54:15.917 --> 02:54:17.278]  You just heard six minutes.
[02:54:17.738 --> 02:54:19.679]  There's a little more at Infowars.com.
[02:54:19.699 --> 02:54:20.760]  We don't know where it came from.
[02:54:21.300 --> 02:54:26.302]  It's the MSNBC shoot they did, some of the raw footage that they never put on television.
[02:54:26.322 --> 02:54:30.925]  They put a few clips out of context of me in there, in their Rise of the New Right piece.
[02:54:31.725 --> 02:54:36.730]  But the headlines, Alex Jones on MSNBC hit piece, The Lost Footage, InfoWars.com.
[02:54:36.750 --> 02:54:38.192]  I want everybody to have a great weekend.
[02:54:38.212 --> 02:54:39.694]  We'll be back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:54:39.734 --> 02:54:42.617]  Don't forget the internet search term today is Bilderberg Films.
[02:54:43.257 --> 02:54:46.000]  And we'll find out in the next hour or so who becomes the number one search.
[02:54:46.581 --> 02:54:50.965]  But in closing, in the last five minutes, Bob, and I want to bring Ted Anderson in here briefly again.
[02:54:51.906 --> 02:55:01.212]  Two weeks ago, when gold was down 50-something bucks, you said, I look forward to go up another, you know, $30 to $60 in the next two weeks.
[02:55:01.573 --> 02:55:03.394]  And you just always keep calling it.
[02:55:03.474 --> 02:55:06.716]  Briefly, how did you know that that was going to happen?
[02:55:08.137 --> 02:55:09.778]  I thought the market was oversold.
[02:55:10.759 --> 02:55:12.340]  I saw that the U.S.
[02:55:12.380 --> 02:55:13.941]  government was starting to back off.
[02:55:13.981 --> 02:55:15.422]  They probably ran out of ammo.
[02:55:16.262 --> 02:55:18.204]  And we did have a rally.
[02:55:18.364 --> 02:55:21.586]  And now we're going sideways to slightly lower.
[02:55:22.219 --> 02:55:30.622]  It's to be expected as we enter into next week, which on Thursday is gold and silver option expiration day.
[02:55:31.323 --> 02:55:42.667]  And the criminals on the comics, the banks who write these options, like to knock the price of the long calls down by knocking the price of gold and silver down.
[02:55:43.248 --> 02:55:49.070]  And they do it, and when Thursday's over, the gold and silver go right back up again for another three or four weeks.
[02:55:49.110 --> 02:55:54.353]  Okay, well what Ted did three weeks ago is he bought a bunch of gold and silver when it was fifty-something dollars less.
[02:55:54.833 --> 02:55:57.854]  Knowing it'd go up, he's passing those savings on quickly, Ted.
[02:55:58.275 --> 02:56:05.919]  Give folks today's incredible specials, and you told me off-air, you can say this on-air if you'd like, this is over Sunday because you're guaranteed to sell out.
[02:56:05.959 --> 02:56:07.659]  Looks like you may already do it, but you'll cover it.
[02:56:08.020 --> 02:56:12.702]  You've got some incredible deals, and you've got a year subscription when you buy one franc.
[02:56:13.002 --> 02:56:16.204]  That makes the franc basically half price, but if you want a bunch of francs,
[02:56:16.604 --> 02:56:22.214]  You have it six, seven dollars lower than what it was, what it's selling for right now.
[02:56:22.274 --> 02:56:24.057]  So quickly, tell folks the offer.
[02:56:24.097 --> 02:56:27.062]  We'll get Chapman's take on how good a deal it is.
[02:56:27.958 --> 02:56:28.458]  Yeah, sure.
[02:56:28.498 --> 02:56:41.105]  The Frank with the International Forecaster is at $265, so really when you take off the $159 for the subscription, it gets you down to about $500 an ounce because the Frank is a fifth of an ounce of gold.
[02:56:41.505 --> 02:56:43.266]  I also have that British Sovereign at $333.
[02:56:43.646 --> 02:56:49.749]  The Frank right now is trading at $271, and the British Sovereign right now is at $333.
[02:56:51.610 --> 02:56:52.110]  Absolutely.
[02:56:52.350 --> 02:56:53.090]  There's nothing better.
[02:57:21.517 --> 02:57:24.801]  And they're really getting it cheap, and Ted Anderson's paying for it.
[02:57:25.321 --> 02:57:27.664]  And Ted is running out of this gold and silver.
[02:57:27.684 --> 02:57:29.226]  He's got silver at a steal of a deal.
[02:57:29.586 --> 02:57:32.990]  The brokers will be there all day, tonight, off and on over the weekend.
[02:57:33.030 --> 02:57:35.393]  If they're not there, leave your name and number.
[02:57:35.413 --> 02:57:39.778]  They'll call you right back, tell them you want the Alex Jones, Bob Chapman radio special.
[02:57:39.818 --> 02:57:40.479]  Here's the number.
[02:57:41.159 --> 02:57:41.520]  800-686-2237.
