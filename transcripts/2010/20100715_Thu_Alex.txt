[00:00:04.949 --> 00:00:09.791]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.791 --> 00:00:11.371]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:12.932]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.932 --> 00:00:17.113]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.113 --> 00:00:24.636]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.636 --> 00:00:25.777]  It is Thursday, July 15, 2010.
[00:00:25.777 --> 00:00:26.897]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:48.669]  Taking your phone calls throughout the broadcast today and Paul Joseph Watson joins us live via video Skype from England to cover the incredible developments as the private planetary banking cartel pushes the planet into a designed depression.
[00:00:49.389 --> 00:01:05.792]  And as we go into this tunnel of designed, orchestrated collapse, they intend for us to come out on the other side, absolute debt slaves to these criminals and this sadistic, psychopathic, ruling class.
[00:01:05.792 --> 00:01:14.774]  Now I have a lot of news here that I want to go over today, but I also want to take your phone calls, but I want to specifically hear from listeners.
[00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:26.170]  And get your view and your take on my statements yesterday that the elite are definitely intending to bring us into a deep depression.
[00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.314]  We're already into the beginning stages of it, sliding into it in the last three years.
[00:01:31.314 --> 00:01:38.820]  Now there are literally hundreds of mainstream news headlines in Europe, Australia, England, Canada, and the United States every day.
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:49.626]  You just type depression in to Google, click news, hundreds of news stories a day, conservatively, as the establishment says, time to dump the greenback.
[00:01:49.626 --> 00:01:52.167]  Oh, you know, investors move away from the greenback.
[00:01:52.167 --> 00:01:58.411]  The greenback needs to only be part of a basket that backs up a new global currency.
[00:01:58.411 --> 00:02:05.875]  And the answer, of course, is giving the same banks that orchestrated this more power, more control, and paying carbon taxes to them.
[00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:06.816]  Do you agree with me?
[00:02:08.308 --> 00:02:17.655]  That they have fully committed to bringing us into a depression to break our will and make us dependent on the government.
[00:02:17.655 --> 00:02:19.696]  Do you have ideas of how to avert this?
[00:02:19.696 --> 00:02:23.419]  I believe we must get the word out now about who is behind this.
[00:02:24.858 --> 00:02:41.862]  Because if we point out that this is a criminal Ponzi scheme and refuse to go along with the expansion in their takeover, we do have a chance of taking our governments back and bringing these people to justice and trying to get our society back on track.
[00:02:41.862 --> 00:02:45.082]  So what are your ideas for solutions?
[00:02:45.082 --> 00:02:47.963]  And to get the word out, that's A, and B,
[00:02:49.451 --> 00:02:56.297]  Do you agree with me that we are entering a collapse that could be road warrior-like in its implications?
[00:02:56.297 --> 00:03:01.341]  And when I say a collapse is imminent, we're already in a depression according to every historical yardstick.
[00:03:01.341 --> 00:03:05.745]  We've had countless top economists on agreeing with that analysis in the last three years.
[00:03:05.745 --> 00:03:06.786]  And now there's no doubt of it.
[00:03:07.406 --> 00:03:10.427]  The question is, how deep will it get?
[00:03:10.427 --> 00:03:18.010]  And will we allow the globalists to use this crisis to fully convert our society into a high-tech, oppressive tyranny?
[00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.911]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:19.911 --> 00:03:19.991]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:20.351]  When we come back,
[00:03:28.254 --> 00:03:35.538]  I'm going to play a short video that we just produced titled, Road Warrior Level Collapse Imminent, where I boil all this down in six and a half minutes.
[00:03:35.538 --> 00:03:37.759]  Then I will get into some of the other news.
[00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:45.144]  And then at the 24 after, when we come in live from that break, we will start taking your phone calls for the balance of the hour.
[00:03:45.144 --> 00:03:49.406]  And then to continue to discuss this issue will be Paul Joseph Watson in the next hour.
[00:03:49.406 --> 00:03:56.070]  We'll also discuss all these different government heads and White House and former White House advisors saying Obama needs a terror attack.
[00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.970]  I don't think so.
[00:04:14.104 --> 00:04:18.786]  Of course, we saw a CNN host two days ago say similar things.
[00:04:18.786 --> 00:04:25.650]  There's no doubt that they are exacerbating the BP oil spill to get more power and control and as a diversion going into the elections.
[00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.331]  There's no doubt now they're gearing up for war with Iran.
[00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:32.453]  There's no doubt we're in a depression and they're exacerbating it every way they can.
[00:04:32.453 --> 00:04:38.716]  There's no doubt major police departments nationwide are announcing they're not going to protect people from hardcore crime.
[00:04:38.716 --> 00:04:41.778]  The police are being converted purely to tax collectors.
[00:04:41.778 --> 00:04:43.239]  They're telling the public not only
[00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.166]  Are we going to raise money off of you and raise your taxes and cut services?
[00:04:48.166 --> 00:04:54.337]  But we are also going to try to keep you from defending yourselves by curtailing the Second Amendment.
[00:04:54.337 --> 00:04:56.781]  It's all coming up on this key Thursday transmission.
[00:04:56.781 --> 00:04:57.281]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.038 --> 00:05:07.479]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:12.720]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.

[00:05:49.753 --> 00:05:50.294]  fallofamerica.net
[00:05:59.414 --> 00:06:03.957]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:03.957 --> 00:06:04.878]  Number 1.
[00:06:04.878 --> 00:06:08.301]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:09.161]  Number 2.
[00:06:09.161 --> 00:06:14.045]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:14.045 --> 00:06:14.785]  It's true.
[00:06:14.785 --> 00:06:19.669]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:20.490]  Number 3.
[00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.072]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:24.072 --> 00:06:27.775]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:27.975 --> 00:06:28.776]  Number 4.
[00:06:28.776 --> 00:06:31.538]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:31.538 --> 00:06:35.222]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:35.222 --> 00:06:36.003]  Number 5.
[00:06:36.003 --> 00:06:40.146]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:40.146 --> 00:06:44.911]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:45.191 --> 00:06:49.373]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:07:54.037 --> 00:07:54.497]  Thank you.
[00:08:09.281 --> 00:08:13.905]  This is our land.
[00:08:13.905 --> 00:08:17.228]  These are our people.
[00:08:17.228 --> 00:08:18.369]  The workers.
[00:08:18.369 --> 00:08:21.091]  The strivers.
[00:08:21.091 --> 00:08:23.773]  The builders.
[00:08:23.773 --> 00:08:27.236]  These are our people.
[00:08:27.236 --> 00:08:30.599]  Who are they?
[00:08:30.599 --> 00:08:33.401]  They are the dark armies.
[00:08:33.401 --> 00:08:36.244]  The dark murdering armies whose only honour
[00:08:37.056 --> 00:08:37.917]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:08:37.917 --> 00:08:40.141]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:55.276 --> 00:08:55.797]  We're live.
[00:08:55.797 --> 00:08:59.381]  It's Thursday, July 15, 2010.
[00:08:59.381 --> 00:09:11.415]  Paul Watson coming up via video link from England to cover the fact that we have more and more government officials saying they need a staged terror attack to get Obama's globalist takeover back on track.
[00:09:12.156 --> 00:09:20.341]  And of course, we have written several articles the last few days at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com dealing with the main issue.
[00:09:20.341 --> 00:09:23.323]  Everything else orbits this issue.
[00:09:23.323 --> 00:09:28.006]  America stands on the precipice of total collapse.
[00:09:28.006 --> 00:09:30.207]  We're going to be breaking that down today.
[00:09:30.207 --> 00:09:32.709]  We're already in a depression.
[00:09:32.709 --> 00:09:35.410]  The question is how deep and how long will it be?
[00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:39.453]  It is an orchestrated event to convert us to total serfdom.
[00:09:40.742 --> 00:09:54.510]  We have another article that we posted at InfoWars.com last night, written by myself and Aaron Dykes, with a key six and a half minute video press release, emergency warning, titled, Road Warrior Level Collapse Imminent.
[00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:59.013]  And in the scale of society, a year is the twinkling of an eye.
[00:09:59.013 --> 00:10:01.855]  Alex Jones says we must take corrective action now.
[00:10:03.083 --> 00:10:05.044]  Collapse is imminent.
[00:10:05.044 --> 00:10:13.566]  The globalists have gone from denying that they've orchestrated a collapse to now trying to fear monger everyone into giving them even more power out of the collapse that they've orchestrated.
[00:10:13.566 --> 00:10:17.067]  So I want to play this video clip and we're going to get into study.
[00:10:17.067 --> 00:10:19.608]  Attack on Iran would start long war.
[00:10:20.782 --> 00:10:23.024]  Major respected study.
[00:10:23.024 --> 00:10:27.688]  We've also got reports cap and trade bill will be part of Senate climate bill.
[00:10:27.688 --> 00:10:34.813]  They're set to pass the banking takeover bill, the Federal Reserve dictatorship over all financial activities, the entire economy.
[00:10:34.813 --> 00:10:38.636]  That's Ron Paul's words and Judge Andrew Napolitano's words, not just mine.
[00:10:38.636 --> 00:10:39.917]  This is hardcore serious.
[00:10:40.858 --> 00:10:50.784]  Also, the Justice Department is suing Arizona, but saying they're not going to sue 800-plus sanctuary cities that refuse to arrest illegal aliens, even when they commit crimes.
[00:10:50.784 --> 00:10:55.567]  That's what the government likes, because they are allied with all criminals.
[00:10:55.567 --> 00:11:07.734]  That's why this criminal government is now announcing everywhere that they're not going to protect you from robbery and from looting and from Grand Theft Auto, because the police are being converted publicly to 100%
[00:11:08.715 --> 00:11:09.516]  We're good to go.
[00:11:29.774 --> 00:11:37.882]  So, this Hydra of the New World Order, this giant squid of tyranny is dragging us to the bottom of the icy depths of despotism.
[00:11:37.882 --> 00:11:41.045]  But right now, let's go ahead and play this special video.
[00:11:41.045 --> 00:11:47.230]  I'm asking everyone to get the video and the audio at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:51.834]  And to get it out to everyone you know, the video is titled, Road Warrior Level Collapse Imminent.
[00:11:52.543 --> 00:11:54.546]  It's also up on our YouTube channel.
[00:11:54.546 --> 00:12:00.293]  But here it is, ladies and gentlemen, streamed live to the radio slash TV viewing audience.
[00:12:07.816 --> 00:12:15.201]  My friends, the United States is transitioning from a free nation to a police state.
[00:12:15.201 --> 00:12:19.484]  The country as we know it is ceasing to exist on every front.
[00:12:19.484 --> 00:12:21.905]  Private central banks took over the United States in 1913.
[00:12:23.226 --> 00:12:30.348]  They've used us as an engine of global domination, and now they've basically run up the country's credit card and preparing to bankrupt this nation by design.
[00:12:30.348 --> 00:12:31.368]  Here's CNN.
[00:12:31.368 --> 00:12:33.189]  Central banks start to abandon the U.S.
[00:12:33.189 --> 00:12:33.849]  dollar.
[00:12:33.849 --> 00:12:37.750]  There's mounting evidence that central banks have little faith in the greenback these days.
[00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:39.410]  Can we blame them?
[00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:48.052]  Like they're the good guys and they're just trying to save us, when they're the admitted authors of the catastrophe that is now unfolding.
[00:12:48.052 --> 00:12:49.853]  And I'm going to cover that information in a moment.
[00:12:50.413 --> 00:12:52.355]  But first I want to define austerity.
[00:12:52.355 --> 00:12:57.101]  This is what the IMF and World Bank, the private holding companies for the private central banks, have done all over the world.
[00:12:57.101 --> 00:12:59.503]  They go in, they get countries in debt by design.
[00:12:59.503 --> 00:13:01.646]  It's all fiat loans that they give them.
[00:13:01.646 --> 00:13:03.688]  So they gain the world through nothing.
[00:13:03.688 --> 00:13:04.930]  It's like an Aladdin's lamp.
[00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.510]  Yes.
[00:13:24.833 --> 00:13:27.215]  to Spain, to the United States.
[00:13:27.215 --> 00:13:29.957]  They take giant loans that they can never pay back.
[00:13:29.957 --> 00:13:35.300]  Then when the society collapses, the very banks come in and loan them more fiat money.
[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:37.101]  And now it's happening here.
[00:13:37.101 --> 00:13:39.303]  Notice what's developing in Arizona.
[00:13:39.303 --> 00:13:48.349]  Obama told Senator Kyle that, well, I'm going to let that crisis and all the thousands of deaths and lawlessness continue because this crisis is good to get amnesty passed.
[00:13:48.349 --> 00:13:49.630]  That's holding the country hostage.
[00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:50.470]  And
[00:14:09.548 --> 00:14:10.069]  I don't
[00:14:24.565 --> 00:14:24.785]  All right.
[00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.423]  You don't get essential services like bridges and roads being fixed.
[00:14:47.423 --> 00:14:48.544]  Those are falling apart.
[00:14:48.544 --> 00:14:50.886]  You don't get police and fire.
[00:14:50.886 --> 00:14:54.109]  Los Angeles is announcing they're not going to fix the sidewalks now.
[00:14:54.109 --> 00:14:57.933]  All you get is a parasitic government basically feeding off of you.
[00:14:57.933 --> 00:14:58.873]  And it's outrageous!
[00:14:59.815 --> 00:15:02.658]  The police are saying, we're not going to protect you.
[00:15:02.658 --> 00:15:08.444]  Now, the Supreme Court has always ruled that the police have no liability to protect you, that it's your job to protect yourself.
[00:15:08.444 --> 00:15:11.027]  They respond after a crime has been committed.
[00:15:11.027 --> 00:15:17.013]  But now they're being completely honest about this and saying, look, you're here for revenue generation for the government.
[00:15:17.013 --> 00:15:19.035]  But there's a lot of good news coming in.
[00:15:19.355 --> 00:15:31.458]  Arizona newspapers are reporting that the freeway speed cameras are being removed from the entire state because the vast majority of the population have refused to pay the tickets.
[00:15:31.458 --> 00:15:46.022]  There is now non-compliance happening all over the state of Arizona, not only to the illegal alien invasion and the designed implosion of the country to merge us into the North American Union, which is officially stated by the last two White Houses.
[00:15:46.722 --> 00:15:49.404]  But now the public is wearing guns in the open.
[00:15:49.404 --> 00:15:51.205]  They're not paying speeding tickets.
[00:15:51.205 --> 00:15:56.629]  They're saying you're an illegitimate government and we're not going along with this and the government is having to back off.
[00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:58.910]  Here's another example out of USA Today.
[00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:01.512]  There is a huge backlash against the naked body scanners.
[00:16:01.512 --> 00:16:03.934]  They admit they are recording her naked genitals.
[00:16:03.934 --> 00:16:05.995]  It is a biometric scan that's being stored.
[00:16:06.195 --> 00:16:19.739]  We've had airport employees getting fistfights when other employees make fun of the size of their sexual organs, and the airlines are getting upset because people aren't flying anymore, and the feds are starting to have to back off what they originally did.
[00:16:19.739 --> 00:16:23.261]  They were trying to break our will, to condition us, to make us submit.
[00:16:23.261 --> 00:16:27.202]  So the moral of the story is, when we say no, we can have an effect.
[00:16:27.642 --> 00:16:32.405]  And we've got to continue to say no and say no in greater numbers because the time is short.
[00:16:32.405 --> 00:16:38.669]  This orchestrated implosion of the world economy is a military form of financial terrorism.
[00:16:38.669 --> 00:16:46.274]  I told my listeners 11 years ago when they got rid of the Glass-Steagall Act that derivatives would be used to bankrupt our nation and every other wealthy nation.
[00:16:46.374 --> 00:16:49.696]  Because I've seen the very same private banks do this in the third world.
[00:16:49.696 --> 00:16:52.598]  And now here we are, 11 years later, it's happening.
[00:16:52.598 --> 00:16:59.223]  And whether it's the New York Times or CNBC, they are admitting that we are now in a depression.
[00:16:59.223 --> 00:17:04.407]  But even more importantly, the Communist Chinese, who hold the majority of European and US debt,
[00:17:04.907 --> 00:17:07.849]  Have now downgraded the United States and Europe.
[00:17:07.849 --> 00:17:19.556]  They are turning us into actual debtor slaves and suddenly the globalist think tanks are announcing China will be the future and the base of the new one world government will be China.
[00:17:19.556 --> 00:17:29.962]  This is high treason by the leaders of our nation who have always wanted to destroy this country and convert it to a collectivist system where they can manipulate and control every facet of our lives.
[00:17:29.962 --> 00:17:31.163]  The bad news is out there.
[00:17:31.383 --> 00:17:33.064]  We are going into a global depression.
[00:17:33.064 --> 00:17:34.726]  It has been engineered by design.
[00:17:34.726 --> 00:17:38.869]  But the good news is, worldwide, the population is waking up.
[00:17:38.869 --> 00:17:46.736]  And Zbigniew Brzezinski said two months ago that the elite are in trouble because for the first time in world history, the entire planet is awakening.
[00:17:46.736 --> 00:17:49.898]  Now is the most important time in modern history.
[00:17:49.898 --> 00:18:00.127]  Our society is at a crossroads, and everything you do to get the word out about this outrageous crime that's taking place brings us one step closer to defeating these people.
[00:18:00.307 --> 00:18:03.508]  We must say no to the new global currency and the SDRs.
[00:18:03.508 --> 00:18:06.609]  We must say no to devaluing the dollar.
[00:18:06.609 --> 00:18:12.371]  We must say no to financial reform bill that actually gives these bankers more control over our economy.
[00:18:12.371 --> 00:18:18.133]  We must stand up and defend the Republic and restore our Constitution and remember that the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:18:18.133 --> 00:18:19.293]  Thank you for watching.
[00:18:25.788 --> 00:18:30.995]  All right, my friends, that video again is posted at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:18:30.995 --> 00:18:32.256]  We're in a race to the finish line.
[00:18:32.256 --> 00:18:37.002]  We must expose the authors of this global meltdown.
[00:18:37.002 --> 00:18:39.565]  They are now posing as our saviors.
[00:18:39.565 --> 00:18:40.827]  They are being discredited.
[00:18:40.827 --> 00:18:43.890]  Their record profits are being noted at the expense of us all.
[00:18:44.687 --> 00:18:49.849]  Their open announcements of a planetary government and a worldwide one-child policy are being trumpeted.
[00:18:49.849 --> 00:18:52.090]  Everything we've discussed is unfolding.
[00:18:52.090 --> 00:19:01.253]  So we have a fighting chance because many patriots for decades understood what was happening and warned their fellow humans, their fellow citizens.
[00:19:01.253 --> 00:19:07.615]  And because of that, because of your courage, we have a fighting chance now, but only a fighting chance.
[00:19:07.615 --> 00:19:13.117]  We can gain the advantage if you accelerate the amount of information you're getting out to everyone you know.
[00:19:14.036 --> 00:19:17.939]  The video you just watched is titled, Road Warrior Level Collapse Imminent.
[00:19:17.939 --> 00:19:20.401]  It is vital that everyone see it today.
[00:19:20.401 --> 00:19:26.026]  Please send it out to your email list, your MySpace, your Facebook, YouTube, other sites.
[00:19:26.026 --> 00:19:36.074]  We need millions and millions of people to read the article by myself and Aaron Dykes and to watch that video that we produced for you to be able to crystallize what we face as a society.
[00:19:36.074 --> 00:19:38.996]  We're going to come back and take calls for the balance of the hour.
[00:19:39.957 --> 00:19:51.646]  With Paul Joseph Watson, huge news blitz, and all of these key issues being broken down subject by subject in the second hour and the third hour, wide open phones and continue news and analysis.
[00:19:51.646 --> 00:19:56.089]  It's all coming up, straight ahead, right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:19:56.089 --> 00:19:58.451]  Don't forget the GCN website, GCNlive.com.
[00:20:00.666 --> 00:20:04.050]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:07.955]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:20:07.955 --> 00:20:11.679]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:20:11.679 --> 00:20:19.428]  At less than $0.02 per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants.
[00:20:19.428 --> 00:20:19.748]  I think so.
[00:20:34.605 --> 00:20:35.005]  I think so.
[00:21:04.808 --> 00:21:06.069]  Tyranny is here.
[00:21:06.069 --> 00:21:10.010]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:12.251]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:21:12.251 --> 00:21:18.114]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:21:18.114 --> 00:21:24.337]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:21:24.777 --> 00:21:30.761]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:21:30.761 --> 00:21:34.924]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:21:34.924 --> 00:21:39.207]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:21:39.207 --> 00:21:45.172]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:21:45.172 --> 00:21:48.734]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:21:48.734 --> 00:21:50.695]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:21:50.695 --> 00:21:51.156]  It's here.

[00:21:59.801 --> 00:22:00.862]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:22:00.862 --> 00:22:05.825]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:22:05.825 --> 00:22:13.890]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:19.234]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:22:19.454 --> 00:22:26.735]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:22:26.735 --> 00:22:32.336]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:22:32.336 --> 00:22:37.397]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:22:37.397 --> 00:22:44.979]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:22:45.339 --> 00:22:51.903]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:22:51.903 --> 00:22:52.964]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:52.964 --> 00:22:53.184]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:06.862]  Attention landscapers, house painters, carpet cleaners, pet sitters, gutter cleaners, and anyone who has their own home service business.
[00:23:06.862 --> 00:23:10.263]  Would you love to build a huge and loyal customer base fast?
[00:23:10.263 --> 00:23:11.423]  Well, now you can.
[00:23:11.423 --> 00:23:13.604]  Introducing the Magic Yellow Flyer.
[00:23:13.604 --> 00:23:22.026]  The Magic Yellow Flyer marketing system is the most effective and inexpensive way to build a referral-only service business in a short period of time.

[00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:35.833]  Corporate America is destroying our country and it's time to rebuild the backbone of America.

[00:24:06.305 --> 00:24:17.608]  We're back live, my friends, and I'm going straight to your phone calls, but I really do want to hear from you about the designed, perpetrated depression we're entering.
[00:24:17.608 --> 00:24:25.691]  They now admit it's a depression, but the bigger question is, how do we reverse this depression, and how bad is it going to get?
[00:24:25.691 --> 00:24:33.353]  Do you agree with me that total collapse is imminent when all over the country they're laying off large portions of the police departments?
[00:24:34.541 --> 00:24:39.243]  They're telling employees that you're going to be paid minimum wage now that work for state government.
[00:24:39.243 --> 00:24:42.764]  The federal government's growing and increasing their wages.
[00:24:42.764 --> 00:24:54.008]  The federal government is engaged in a bankruptcy by design, just like banks repossess your home, just like they hope you won't make the payments, or hope you won't make payments on the farm.
[00:24:54.008 --> 00:24:55.989]  It's the same thing for our nation.
[00:24:55.989 --> 00:24:57.910]  And that's what we're discussing here today.
[00:24:57.910 --> 00:24:59.411]  Let's go to Bruce in Michigan.
[00:24:59.411 --> 00:25:00.251]  You're on the air, Bruce.
[00:25:01.365 --> 00:25:02.606]  Hi Alex, how are you doing?
[00:25:02.606 --> 00:25:03.647]  I'm doing alright, my friend.
[00:25:03.647 --> 00:25:05.648]  I'm still alive and kicking.
[00:25:05.648 --> 00:25:06.889]  Right on.
[00:25:06.889 --> 00:25:08.450]  Everything you said is true.
[00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:15.915]  Yes, and the depression that is coming is going to be worse than anybody could ever conceive about 29.
[00:25:15.915 --> 00:25:22.319]  Because, I would say 85% of the people in this country are not prepared.
[00:25:22.319 --> 00:25:29.124]  You know, they don't... I mean, even back in the old depression, you know, my grandparents, I'm from New Jersey originally,
[00:25:29.625 --> 00:25:29.925]  What's that?
[00:25:49.904 --> 00:25:50.244]  That's it.
[00:26:09.102 --> 00:26:10.583]  With this decadent population.
[00:26:10.583 --> 00:26:14.825]  Well, the government thinks they're going to come to the system and say, we'll do whatever you say.
[00:26:14.825 --> 00:26:17.487]  We'll accept wars, tyranny, anything.
[00:26:17.487 --> 00:26:18.888]  Just give us our entertainment.
[00:26:18.888 --> 00:26:20.849]  Give us our six pack of beer.
[00:26:20.849 --> 00:26:27.673]  And that's why the globalists are doing this so they can sell the public on a new way of life and total collectivism.
[00:26:27.673 --> 00:26:29.234]  That's why they're breaking us by design.
[00:26:29.234 --> 00:26:31.055]  That's in the IMF and World Bank plans.
[00:26:31.875 --> 00:26:47.948]  And the bigger issue is then what are we going to do about it as they take all these domesticated jellyfish and put them on the rocks, basically wreck them, and then point these hordes of dumbed-down slobs at those of us that are self-sufficient?
[00:26:47.948 --> 00:26:53.233]  Well, I think what you have to do there, and I meet with a group of people on every Thursday night.
[00:26:53.233 --> 00:27:00.639]  We watch your videos, other videos on this type of subject matter, and everybody's pretty well self-sufficient in our group.
[00:27:01.497 --> 00:27:13.426]  Uh, we feel that possibly what you're looking at is maybe getting one state or a couple of states together in an area that just, uh, removes themselves from the union and we start from there.
[00:27:13.426 --> 00:27:16.108]  Well, I mean, listen, 36 states are already saying
[00:27:16.368 --> 00:27:23.410]  We're just going to nullify all these federal taxes because you take our money and you send a small portion back with strings attached.
[00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:24.930]  We can't survive.
[00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:28.931]  And so that's why the globalists realize they're going to try to break the states.
[00:27:28.931 --> 00:27:35.532]  But they've got the John Warner Defense Authorization Act that they stated is to suppress the states and the governors and the legislatures.
[00:27:35.532 --> 00:27:42.073]  And so that's why they're preparing another Oklahoma City bombing to blame it on the state's rights movement, as I've been saying for over a year.
[00:27:42.073 --> 00:27:44.034]  Now, even the globalists are saying they may stage
[00:27:44.594 --> 00:27:44.954]  I don't know.
[00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:11.395]  And so we've got a fighting chance, but that's why before they stage it, it's so important to get the word out now, because if we get the word out to a great enough level, they may back off and not stage it.
[00:28:11.395 --> 00:28:14.616]  Or, you know, that's the best case scenario, but there's three scenarios.
[00:28:14.616 --> 00:28:17.558]  Best case is they don't do it, because they know we're on to them.
[00:28:17.558 --> 00:28:24.281]  The second best scenario is they do it, but we've woken up so many people, it backfires on them to the fact that it's a staged event.
[00:28:24.741 --> 00:28:26.082]  Can I say one more thing?
[00:28:26.082 --> 00:28:31.704]  The only reason I'm even bringing this up is because when this event went down up here in Michigan recently, you were directly drug into this.
[00:28:51.974 --> 00:28:52.975]  I work in a bookstore.
[00:28:52.975 --> 00:28:54.495]  I'm not going to name the store.
[00:28:54.495 --> 00:28:57.837]  Karl Rove was in there signing about a month ago.
[00:28:57.837 --> 00:29:04.221]  And, you know, all these Reaganites and, you know, all these people that think like that were in there getting their autographs from his book.
[00:29:04.221 --> 00:29:07.662]  And in the middle of this whole thing, I'm watching this guy.
[00:29:07.662 --> 00:29:12.445]  He's about 6'7", and he's got a big, burly voice, and he just starts cursing.
[00:29:13.323 --> 00:29:14.104]  I don't know.
[00:29:23.823 --> 00:29:26.125]  He's screaming at everybody in this room.
[00:29:26.125 --> 00:29:27.666]  Y'all need to watch InfoWars.
[00:29:27.666 --> 00:29:28.707]  Listen to InfoWars.
[00:29:28.707 --> 00:29:30.568]  You need to listen to Alex Jones.
[00:29:30.568 --> 00:29:38.814]  And what he did was he turned the whole thing around because all of a sudden all these old ladies are going, God bless you, Carl.
[00:29:38.814 --> 00:29:39.655]  We love you.
[00:29:39.655 --> 00:29:43.097]  And then I heard several of them going, who's this Alex Jones?
[00:29:43.097 --> 00:29:45.479]  He sounds like some kind of a troublemaker.
[00:29:45.479 --> 00:29:48.121]  He ought to be arrested and thrown in jail.
[00:29:48.121 --> 00:29:48.662]  Stay there.
[00:29:48.662 --> 00:29:49.002]  Stay there.
[00:29:49.002 --> 00:29:49.622]  I want to hear more.
[00:29:49.622 --> 00:29:50.263]  Soundstage.
[00:29:50.723 --> 00:29:54.645]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[00:32:00.731 --> 00:32:07.174]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[00:32:07.174 --> 00:32:12.417]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.
[00:32:12.417 --> 00:32:25.984]  Featuring Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Joseph Farah, David Icke, Naomi Wolf, G. Edward Griffin, Doug McIntyre, Mark Crispin Miller, Mickey Z, Doug Casey, David McElhaney, and myself, Alex Jones.

[00:33:01.784 --> 00:33:07.506]  Unfortunately, this is the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:07.506 --> 00:33:22.389]  If you had to mark the landscape of the world and the resistance against tyranny, it'd be Ron Paul, Alex Jones, and a handful of others.
[00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:24.430]  That's why we need your prayers and support.
[00:33:25.464 --> 00:33:30.926]  Now, this may have been a fellow in Michigan who was simply upset and fed up by his state being destroyed.
[00:33:30.926 --> 00:33:40.609]  Karl Rove now poses as an anti-New World Order patriot by setting himself against Obama, who's continued everything Bush did, and Bush himself was just a puppet.
[00:33:40.609 --> 00:33:42.110]  And so is Karl Rove.
[00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:44.351]  He's nothing compared to Zbigniew Brzezinski or a...
[00:33:45.754 --> 00:33:51.296]  Henry Kissinger, but he is more powerful and important than a George W. Bush.
[00:33:51.296 --> 00:33:59.760]  But we do need to be stern and focused and serious, but cuss words and things like that are not needed in public events, and it does make us look bad.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:04.722]  But the guy might have been a fed, might have been a provocateur, or it may have been real.
[00:34:04.722 --> 00:34:07.883]  But finish up, Bruce, with your story at the bookstore in Michigan.
[00:34:08.717 --> 00:34:22.016]  Well, the only thing I wanted to say about Alex is when that type of event goes down like that, and here you've got these old ladies who've never even heard of you, and probably think we're all a bunch of lunatics.
[00:34:22.934 --> 00:34:33.039]  And you know, for me to hear several of them going, well this Alex Jones should be arrested and people who think like him should be arrested, that doesn't do a lot of good for our cause.
[00:34:33.039 --> 00:34:38.321]  But it's not really the fault of the guy, even though it sounds like what he said was a little out of taste.
[00:34:38.321 --> 00:34:43.604]  It's their fault for having a mindset about we need to arrest people that are mean to our precious Karl Rove.
[00:34:43.604 --> 00:34:45.145]  I mean, all he did was call him an SOB.
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:49.283]  Oh no, it was worse than that.
[00:34:49.283 --> 00:34:51.025]  I won't even give you the initials.
[00:34:51.025 --> 00:34:54.609]  Oh, well that sounds like it probably was staged.
[00:34:54.609 --> 00:35:00.756]  Let's talk on the terms of like Andrew Dice Clay giving a live comedy performance, okay?
[00:35:00.756 --> 00:35:01.597]  That kind of language.
[00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:02.450]  Yeah.
[00:35:18.146 --> 00:35:18.647]  Yeah, you're right.
[00:35:34.241 --> 00:35:39.726]  For a guy to come in like that, if it was staged, naturally they were taking shots at you.
[00:35:39.726 --> 00:35:45.892]  If he was being passionate about it, I'm just saying maybe the listeners need to calm down a little bit.
[00:35:45.892 --> 00:35:47.874]  Bruce, I hear you.
[00:35:47.874 --> 00:35:51.998]  We've got to be very wise about what we do.
[00:35:51.998 --> 00:35:58.924]  But going back to Karl Rove, Karl Rove admittedly planted a bug in his own office during a Texas campaign.
[00:35:59.645 --> 00:36:01.947]  to blame it on their political enemies.
[00:36:01.947 --> 00:36:03.968]  He does do little many false flags.
[00:36:03.968 --> 00:36:08.832]  The police have been caught from Greece to Canada to the United States in the news.
[00:36:08.832 --> 00:36:14.356]  I mean, Denver just a few years ago attacking their own officers in front of news cameras dressed as protesters.
[00:36:14.356 --> 00:36:15.977]  So that could be staged.
[00:36:15.977 --> 00:36:18.659]  I mean, what do we know has been staged against me?
[00:36:18.659 --> 00:36:24.583]  Within three hours of Joe Stack flying his aircraft reportedly into the Echelon building in North Austin off 183,
[00:36:26.184 --> 00:36:32.628]  With the stack attack, the Austin American Statesman in the New York Daily News said that I was praising it.
[00:36:32.628 --> 00:36:38.971]  When before my name was even in the news, an hour and 10 minutes after it happened, I was on air that day.
[00:36:38.971 --> 00:36:42.113]  It happened about an hour and 10 minutes before I got on air.
[00:36:42.113 --> 00:36:42.814]  Happened at what, about 9.55?
[00:36:42.814 --> 00:36:46.276]  I'm on air at 11.
[00:36:46.276 --> 00:36:50.178]  So I guess less than an hour and 10 minutes, to be technical.
[00:36:50.178 --> 00:36:55.181]  I went on air and I said, you watch, they're going to blame this on me, and it looks like this is staged.
[00:36:57.092 --> 00:36:59.194]  And sure enough, that happened.
[00:36:59.194 --> 00:37:07.480]  Now remember, within two hours of Richard Poplowski in Pittsburgh killing the three cops in cold blood, it was all my fault and he was my fan.
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:09.762]  We search engines in his name and his handle.
[00:37:09.762 --> 00:37:19.890]  He was all over InfoWars and Prison Planet saying I was a horrible piece of garbage that worked for Israel, which of course isn't even true, and that I was evil because I'm not for violence.
[00:37:21.567 --> 00:37:26.608]  And of course it came out he'd visited thousands of websites and attacked me on scores of them.
[00:37:26.608 --> 00:37:31.509]  But when they got into his computer, they instantly came out and said it was my fault.
[00:37:31.509 --> 00:37:49.414]  And now David Frum and other Bilderberg Group members, we'll put his image on screen if we can, David Frum just in the last two months has written several articles, just search engine Alex Jones, David Frum, saying I'm this big dangerous enemy, that I'm bad, that I've got to be dealt with.
[00:37:49.414 --> 00:37:50.194]  So it is creepy.
[00:37:50.973 --> 00:38:00.659]  I mean, it is creepy that the Southern Poverty Law Center, the ADL, they've got me at the top of their hit list because I won't do what their minions do.
[00:38:00.659 --> 00:38:07.704]  It has come out that the Southern Poverty Law Center infiltrated and was running the Elohim City white supremacist compound that McVeigh was in.
[00:38:07.704 --> 00:38:12.567]  That's come out from lawsuits and declassified FBI memos.
[00:38:12.567 --> 00:38:18.991]  Turns out the Justice Department was running the whole thing and did have their head of counterterrorism in Oklahoma in the days before and they lied about that.
[00:38:20.245 --> 00:38:31.128]  I expose the fact that many of their operatives, white supremacist leaders that we've named here decades ago, over a decade ago, like Hal Turner, who's hooked in with Sean Hannity.
[00:38:31.128 --> 00:38:32.469]  I said he is a federal agent.
[00:38:32.469 --> 00:38:33.729]  That's now come out in federal court.
[00:38:33.729 --> 00:38:37.550]  He is a federal agent, not just an operative.
[00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:48.754]  And so they're very upset with me because they don't want a patriot movement that is for whites, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians, and Jews, and Catholics, and Protestants, and Hindus, and Muslims.
[00:38:50.154 --> 00:38:51.616]  I'm a Christian, that's what I believe in.
[00:38:51.616 --> 00:38:53.219]  I'm a Protestant, that's what I believe in.
[00:38:53.219 --> 00:38:56.704]  But I don't make my show about that issue.
[00:38:56.704 --> 00:38:59.468]  It's about just warning people about what's going on.
[00:38:59.468 --> 00:39:03.013]  And I believe everybody wants liberty and freedom, except for a few thousand globalists.
[00:39:03.013 --> 00:39:04.496]  And they're on record saying that.
[00:39:04.496 --> 00:39:05.477]  And so they don't like me.
[00:39:06.238 --> 00:39:17.429]  They don't like the fact that the leading light and the leading voice out there who's successfully waking up the most new people to the true paradigm is making it a big tent.
[00:39:17.429 --> 00:39:26.418]  They have always put white supremacist groups and Mexican supremacist groups and black supremacist groups out there as the leading edge of a rebellion against tyranny to make it look asinine and ridiculous.
[00:39:27.199 --> 00:39:31.841]  And that does sound like a false flag that you witnessed or somebody who's just fed up.
[00:39:31.841 --> 00:39:32.942]  But I appreciate your call.
[00:39:32.942 --> 00:39:36.043]  Now let's try to hurry through calls now, but that was a key issue he just raised.
[00:39:36.043 --> 00:39:38.884]  Lex in Ohio, you're on the air.
[00:39:38.884 --> 00:39:41.445]  Alex, I agree with you that a collapse is coming.
[00:39:41.445 --> 00:39:42.866]  I think an internet
[00:39:43.747 --> 00:39:49.691]  Uh, kind of scare is a great way to sort of go along with that collapse because it would absolutely cripple people.
[00:39:49.691 --> 00:39:50.011]  Great point.
[00:39:50.011 --> 00:40:03.758]  The oil spill as the environmental disaster, the key to the New World Order as Gorbachev said, uh, the Iran war as a giant global distraction, uh, the economic implosion, uh, the open borders.
[00:40:03.758 --> 00:40:11.663]  But yes, they're definitely gearing up for a fake cyber attack against our system as a pretext to bring in control because if they leave the internet up, we're going to beat them.
[00:40:12.998 --> 00:40:17.500]  So I have an Infobomb failsafe I want to run by you.
[00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:23.503]  What I did is I googled Ohio AM stations and I got this huge list.
[00:40:23.503 --> 00:40:33.587]  And so then I sent one email with tons of addresses to station managers and programming directors asking them to carry the Alex Jones Show.
[00:40:33.587 --> 00:40:37.809]  So I'm challenging your listeners right now, all the other Infowars, to do the same thing.
[00:40:37.809 --> 00:40:41.151]  Google your state name, AM radio stations,
[00:40:42.128 --> 00:40:44.771]  And what I would ask you, Alex, is to help me out.
[00:40:44.771 --> 00:40:47.014]  What information should they include in their version?
[00:40:47.014 --> 00:40:52.160]  I just said, hey, put the show on, but maybe you could put some buzzwords that are industry-specific and help us out.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:57.926]  Well, you can send them an Alexa screenshot of my website being massively bigger.
[00:40:58.587 --> 00:40:58.747]  Just
[00:41:15.783 --> 00:41:16.163]  I don't know.
[00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:46.874]  Pick up the show and then point them to the GCNlive.com affiliate page with the satellites, all of it.
[00:41:46.874 --> 00:41:51.617]  Other networks, when they pick up one show, they try to make the stations pick up other shows.
[00:41:51.617 --> 00:41:53.759]  They try to make them sign year-long contracts.
[00:41:53.759 --> 00:41:55.260]  They try to strong-arm them.
[00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:56.901]  Genesis is carry at will.
[00:41:57.401 --> 00:42:01.582]  It's just you've signed the affiliate agreement to carry half our ads, half their ads are theirs.
[00:42:01.582 --> 00:42:07.163]  It's the most liberal and open and pro-station affiliate system out there.
[00:42:07.163 --> 00:42:12.464]  And so, I mean, it's well-produced, it's power-packed, it's well-documented.
[00:42:12.464 --> 00:42:17.046]  And yes, that's why I'm on WWCR as a backup, 100,000 watt shortwave.
[00:42:17.046 --> 00:42:18.626]  We're on the satellite.
[00:42:18.626 --> 00:42:20.646]  We're gaining new affiliates several every week.
[00:42:20.646 --> 00:42:22.807]  This is the fastest growth rate we've ever had.
[00:42:23.567 --> 00:42:24.828]  And of course we are number one.
[00:42:24.828 --> 00:42:26.629]  This is the number one show on the internet.
[00:42:26.629 --> 00:42:28.349]  You tell them the market has spoken.
[00:42:28.349 --> 00:42:29.910]  Give us Alex Jones.
[00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:31.791]  Shadow the left-right paradigm.
[00:42:31.791 --> 00:42:33.932]  And believe me, most stations already know about us.
[00:42:33.932 --> 00:42:35.473]  That's why they're picking us up.
[00:42:35.473 --> 00:42:36.794]  They can pick up.
[00:42:36.794 --> 00:42:39.335]  We have a satellite that re-airs at 24 hours a day.
[00:42:39.335 --> 00:42:42.236]  Because a lot of stations are recording one show while another's live.
[00:42:42.236 --> 00:42:46.659]  And so it gets hard for them with limited staff to be able to take the show when it's live, record it, and play it later.
[00:42:46.659 --> 00:42:48.119]  Tell them, no, no, this is 24 hours a day.
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:59.671]  Genesis has a satellite, you know, after we're not live, retransmitting it so that they can record it, re-air it, or play it whenever they want, or take the stream live.
[00:42:59.671 --> 00:43:07.839]  I mean, it's just, there's so many ways to pick up the transmission, and it's so easy to do.
[00:43:07.839 --> 00:43:09.260]  Anything else, Lex?
[00:43:10.071 --> 00:43:11.071]  I just want to throw it out.
[00:43:11.071 --> 00:43:14.112]  I just write back out to your listeners and your viewers.
[00:43:14.112 --> 00:43:15.072]  It's really easy.
[00:43:15.072 --> 00:43:21.454]  This took me 20 minutes maybe to accumulate the emails and cut and paste or the addresses and cut and paste them in there.
[00:43:21.454 --> 00:43:22.274]  But now I've got it.
[00:43:22.274 --> 00:43:23.654]  You know, it's in my sent messages.
[00:43:23.654 --> 00:43:26.775]  I can just keep bugging these guys and I can keep adding more addresses to it.
[00:43:26.775 --> 00:43:32.196]  It stays in your, you know, in your sent mail and you just keep accumulating this list and we can reach more and more people.
[00:43:32.196 --> 00:43:33.436]  Thank you for your time, Alex.
[00:43:33.436 --> 00:43:33.876]  Thank you.
[00:43:33.876 --> 00:43:35.417]  I appreciate your call.
[00:43:35.417 --> 00:43:35.657]  Look,
[00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:41.155]  The biggest shows in the country have 600, 400 affiliates.
[00:43:41.155 --> 00:43:46.861]  And the fact that we're well over 70, that's quite a few, but a lot of them are small mom and pops and they're precious and they reach a lot of people.
[00:43:46.861 --> 00:43:52.327]  Some are big major stations and major markets now, but generally owned by private families or smaller media groups.
[00:43:53.408 --> 00:43:59.591]  The big three syndicators tend to own their own stations, so they've got a oligopoly.
[00:43:59.591 --> 00:44:01.512]  That's the major problem.
[00:44:01.512 --> 00:44:10.938]  And I have over the years been approached by some of the bigger networks, but I would not have editorial control over what I do on my show, and so I've turned it down.
[00:44:10.938 --> 00:44:12.198]  I mean, here's an example.
[00:44:12.198 --> 00:44:19.102]  History Channel just wanted me to be in a big show about the Illuminati, and I was thinking about doing it, but you know what?
[00:44:19.102 --> 00:44:21.463]  I don't care about just getting my face on TV.
[00:44:21.463 --> 00:44:22.304]  Most people would kill.
[00:44:22.984 --> 00:44:28.629]  To be on a History Channel show that's going to air literally hundreds of times in the next five years, because they air those shows over and over again.
[00:44:28.629 --> 00:44:29.850]  I'm just not going to do it.
[00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:32.652]  I'm constantly offered reality TV shows.
[00:44:32.652 --> 00:44:34.313]  Money.
[00:44:34.313 --> 00:44:36.935]  They come in here, but I guarantee you they distort it.
[00:44:36.935 --> 00:44:41.719]  They take the few goofy things out of months of videotape and distort what we do.
[00:44:41.719 --> 00:44:43.020]  So I just don't care.
[00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:44.101]  I know we're collapsing.
[00:44:44.101 --> 00:44:46.083]  I know the New World Order is real.
[00:44:46.083 --> 00:44:48.525]  Why would I care about being on TV and being a big shot?
[00:44:48.965 --> 00:45:03.628]  When I literally see scores of articles a day admitting that they're putting poison in all our food, all our water supplies, in our air, genetic engineering, cancer exploding, diabetes exploding, sterilization and infertility exploding.
[00:45:03.628 --> 00:45:09.169]  I mean, once you realize what's really going on, none of this stuff even matters.
[00:45:09.169 --> 00:45:10.970]  And I'm not bragging and tooting my own horn.
[00:45:13.393 --> 00:45:20.398]  I'm saying we've had a major effect, but I don't have any desire to have my message distorted.
[00:45:20.398 --> 00:45:38.352]  It is much more precious to be able to go on some little Christian station for an hour as a guest and talk about real issues in a long form with full ideas to unlock minds and shift paradigms or go on some talk station or sports station or morning zoo show as a guest
[00:45:39.616 --> 00:45:39.856]  We're good
[00:46:00.683 --> 00:46:01.804]  That's what I desire.
[00:46:01.804 --> 00:46:07.668]  That is wealth to me, not physical wealth, not my name being big.
[00:46:07.668 --> 00:46:14.893]  I mean, I already can't go to a restaurant anywhere in the country or walk down the street anywhere in the country without being stopped.
[00:46:14.893 --> 00:46:20.276]  And I always like it because it resonates as a sonar ping that we're reaching people.
[00:46:20.276 --> 00:46:23.498]  But at the same time, I have lost my privacy.
[00:46:23.498 --> 00:46:26.740]  So I have no desire just to be on big TV shows.
[00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:30.183]  And I'm really thinking about just not doing any more taped interviews.
[00:46:31.203 --> 00:46:34.286]  Whether it's CNN, Fox.
[00:46:34.286 --> 00:46:39.130]  I mean, I refuse to go on ManCow's Fox pilot because I don't want to have to fly to New York to be part of a taping.
[00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:40.671]  So I sent a producer up there years ago.
[00:46:40.671 --> 00:46:42.973]  I mean, I've already done this a lot.
[00:46:42.973 --> 00:46:45.575]  We're not here just seeking to have a big name.
[00:46:45.575 --> 00:46:54.482]  Do you understand that as I get closer to being an international phenomenon, which has already really started, I march closer to being killed.
[00:46:54.482 --> 00:46:56.704]  I march closer to Mount Doom.
[00:46:57.742 --> 00:46:59.483]  To the crack of doom.
[00:46:59.483 --> 00:47:02.225]  I mean, this is not for the faint of heart.
[00:47:02.225 --> 00:47:04.726]  This is not a joke.
[00:47:04.726 --> 00:47:05.467]  This is real.
[00:47:05.467 --> 00:47:07.528]  This is history being made here.
[00:47:07.528 --> 00:47:11.390]  And I look back on, I never intended to be this successful.
[00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:16.053]  I never intended to be, more and more, the leader.
[00:47:16.053 --> 00:47:21.096]  And I look back on things I did and things I was focused on and what I thought was important.
[00:47:22.293 --> 00:47:23.534]  And I'm ashamed of myself.
[00:47:23.534 --> 00:47:26.175]  I mean, I was heads above most people morally.
[00:47:26.175 --> 00:47:32.238]  I've always been someone who loves innocence, loves goodness, loves honor, loves strength, loves courage.
[00:47:32.238 --> 00:47:37.180]  I've always been someone who isn't envious and jealous, and I didn't realize that most people are governed by that.
[00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:43.683]  But as I gained some wisdom at 36 years, and I gained more in every year than I knew previously in the 36,
[00:47:45.743 --> 00:47:53.308]  As I exponentially awaken, and this is a process we're all going through, I'm really beginning to realize what matters at the end of the day.
[00:47:53.308 --> 00:47:57.030]  I mean, I'm ready to die.
[00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.930]  I'm ready to be in prison.
[00:47:57.930 --> 00:47:58.891]  I'm ready to be destroyed.
[00:47:58.891 --> 00:47:59.792]  I'm ready to be tortured.
[00:47:59.792 --> 00:48:01.493]  I'm ready to have my name dug through the mud.
[00:48:01.493 --> 00:48:02.413]  I'm ready.
[00:48:02.413 --> 00:48:04.154]  It's already happening.
[00:48:04.154 --> 00:48:06.376]  Because I know the message got through.
[00:48:06.376 --> 00:48:10.418]  I know the transmission made it through to you, and I was here to warn you.
[00:48:10.418 --> 00:48:11.599]  And this is history being made.
[00:48:12.383 --> 00:48:14.586]  This is history being made right now.
[00:48:14.586 --> 00:48:18.792]  We accurately gauged the enemy operation and their attack profile.
[00:48:18.792 --> 00:48:22.338]  We accurately broke down what they were setting up and developing.
[00:48:22.338 --> 00:48:26.003]  And we accurately made a defense against it.
[00:48:26.003 --> 00:48:27.786]  And now we've had a huge effect globally.
[00:48:29.005 --> 00:48:34.869]  To the level of the Bilderberg Group, specifically singles myself and Ron Paul out for destruction.
[00:48:34.869 --> 00:48:41.174]  But because we are so prominent, they understand that if they murder us or even destroy us, people see through it.
[00:48:41.174 --> 00:48:43.075]  And so I do have a hedge of protection up.
[00:48:43.075 --> 00:48:44.516]  I don't know for how long.
[00:48:44.516 --> 00:48:50.240]  And if it's God's will to lower the hedge today and that I be destroyed today, I say so be it.
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:52.482]  I want to live to be 100 years old.
[00:48:52.482 --> 00:48:54.003]  I love life.
[00:48:54.003 --> 00:48:55.684]  In fact, the fact that I've given in
[00:48:56.505 --> 00:49:04.729]  To committing to this, no matter where it leads, the fact that I've committed makes life so much sweeter.
[00:49:04.729 --> 00:49:23.197]  I mean, the smell of the trees and the feel of the wind, and just to look into the water at a lake and see perch swimming around, and to see my sweet father or mother and how good they are, and to just imagine them down the road becoming old and dying, it's all poetry.
[00:49:24.097 --> 00:49:36.464]  And to see the innocence of my children and how good they are, and to realize that all that matters is that we have a free world for them and for your children.
[00:49:36.464 --> 00:49:40.526]  It is so real.
[00:49:40.526 --> 00:49:43.148]  All that needs to be guarded is freedom.
[00:49:43.148 --> 00:49:45.209]  If you have freedom, everything else flows from it.
[00:49:46.257 --> 00:49:47.557]  We must protect the good.
[00:49:47.557 --> 00:49:49.058]  We must protect the pure.
[00:49:49.058 --> 00:49:53.359]  We must protect the genetics of the plants and the animals and the humans.
[00:49:53.359 --> 00:49:57.440]  That is the real environmental issue.
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:01.421]  And the globalists are rewriting the entire genetic programming of the Earth right now.
[00:50:01.421 --> 00:50:05.022]  This is a genetic dictatorship that's being established.
[00:50:05.022 --> 00:50:07.823]  And all that matters is that we beat these people.
[00:50:07.823 --> 00:50:08.944]  They are vandals.
[00:50:08.944 --> 00:50:10.064]  They are psychopaths.
[00:50:11.291 --> 00:50:21.535]  Beauty to them is destruction and ashes and burned cities and deformity and sickness.
[00:50:21.535 --> 00:50:39.401]  Hell is being released and you look back at our ancestors and all the struggles they went through and all of the women who went through childbirth and all of our ancestors that fought and died to protect our tribes and our people and all of the struggles.
[00:50:40.896 --> 00:50:42.797]  It's always been a struggle against good and evil.
[00:50:42.797 --> 00:50:48.982]  Against the true human spirit and the dark, psychopathic minority that always seeks after power.
[00:50:48.982 --> 00:50:55.086]  We must meet them on the field of intellectual, economic, and spiritual and philosophical battle.
[00:50:55.086 --> 00:50:55.767]  And I am here.
[00:50:55.767 --> 00:50:56.607]  I'm suited up.
[00:50:56.607 --> 00:50:57.708]  I'm in the war.
[00:50:57.708 --> 00:50:59.209]  What about you?
[00:50:59.209 --> 00:51:00.090]  Choose your destiny.

[00:52:00.629 --> 00:52:05.593]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:52:05.593 --> 00:52:06.593]  What have we got?
[00:52:06.593 --> 00:52:09.035]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:52:09.035 --> 00:52:10.056]  A republic.
[00:52:10.056 --> 00:52:12.698]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:52:12.698 --> 00:52:14.960]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:16.981]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:52:16.981 --> 00:52:18.662]  So they think they own our land?
[00:52:18.662 --> 00:52:19.983]  They think they own our water?
[00:52:19.983 --> 00:52:20.604]  Children?
[00:52:20.604 --> 00:52:21.725]  Our education?
[00:52:21.725 --> 00:52:22.545]  Our money?
[00:52:22.545 --> 00:52:26.188]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:52:26.568 --> 00:52:31.534]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:52:31.534 --> 00:52:32.555]  We have the facts.
[00:52:32.555 --> 00:52:33.716]  We have the Constitution.
[00:52:33.716 --> 00:52:34.618]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:52:34.618 --> 00:52:35.499]  We have common law.
[00:52:35.499 --> 00:52:38.042]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:38.042 --> 00:52:41.806]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:52:41.926 --> 00:52:46.870]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:48.372]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:52:48.372 --> 00:52:49.453]  Don't tread on me.

[00:53:01.377 --> 00:53:02.617]  Global meltdowns.
[00:53:02.617 --> 00:53:04.018]  Massive unemployment.
[00:53:04.018 --> 00:53:05.238]  Endless wars.
[00:53:05.238 --> 00:53:06.879]  A new currency crisis.
[00:53:06.879 --> 00:53:08.960]  Financially and morally bankrupt.
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:11.120]  A great and terrible storm is approaching.
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:13.021]  So what's the best way to get ready?
[00:53:13.021 --> 00:53:15.102]  To get prepared for hard times ahead.
[00:53:15.102 --> 00:53:17.082]  Introducing Off The Grid News.
[00:53:17.082 --> 00:53:23.585]  A weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.

[00:54:05.836 --> 00:54:07.537]  Monday through Friday at 11 a.m.
[00:54:07.537 --> 00:54:14.603]  we kick off this transmission.
[00:54:14.603 --> 00:54:24.210]  Let's go ahead and go back to your calls.
[00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:26.511]  Marissa in New York, you're on the air.
[00:54:26.511 --> 00:54:28.453]  Thanks for holding.
[00:54:28.453 --> 00:54:35.198]  Hi Alex, I wanted to thank you for educating me and people that I'm sending your information to.
[00:54:35.874 --> 00:54:40.175]  I think you're a real hero and you have a lot of courage and people should appreciate it.
[00:54:40.175 --> 00:54:41.416]  I don't think enough people do.
[00:54:41.416 --> 00:54:44.697]  So I have a couple things I want to tell you.
[00:54:44.697 --> 00:54:50.099]  I have a sort of an unconventional idea of the world.
[00:54:50.099 --> 00:54:54.240]  I really don't believe that we're in a fight against good and evil.
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:57.441]  I think it's more intelligence and stupidity.
[00:54:57.441 --> 00:55:02.963]  And I don't think we've ever been ruled by any intelligent life down here.
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:09.642]  And I think when you say that somebody's evil, that's sort of giving them a compliment.
[00:55:09.642 --> 00:55:14.185]  Well, Marissa, there's a lot of ignorant people that serve this system through ignorance.
[00:55:14.185 --> 00:55:19.287]  I agree with you there, but I have read literally hundreds and hundreds of globalist white papers.
[00:55:19.287 --> 00:55:21.488]  We've posted them on the websites.
[00:55:21.488 --> 00:55:23.609]  We've read from them here on air.
[00:55:23.609 --> 00:55:26.711]  This is an organized program that we're facing.
[00:55:26.711 --> 00:55:28.972]  This is extremely organized and is a
[00:55:30.292 --> 00:55:56.310]  Intelligence that if anything is beyond human and is the old devil Okay, I believe that there is such a thing as evil and good, but I also believe that human beings have trouble Facing what they are which is very unevolved and stupid which is kind of like we have never really been controlled humans are multifaceted Though there's the worst and the best in us
[00:55:56.991 --> 00:56:07.587]  Yeah, but if we were really intelligent, we wouldn't have wars continually, we wouldn't have people without weak... But ma'am, ma'am, the globalists orchestrate those wars to consolidate power.
[00:56:07.587 --> 00:56:08.769]  These are well planned out.
[00:56:08.769 --> 00:56:09.109]  These aren't...
[00:56:11.148 --> 00:56:18.490]  And at the bottom line is you're constantly sort of complimenting these people, like they are dumbing us down.
[00:56:18.490 --> 00:56:21.191]  They are so below the average person.
[00:56:21.191 --> 00:56:24.592]  These people are way below you and myself.
[00:56:24.592 --> 00:56:28.513]  Intelligence-wise, I don't care if they go to Harvard, I don't care if they're in Yale.
[00:56:28.513 --> 00:56:30.073]  They are way below average.
[00:56:30.513 --> 00:56:39.014]  And they are, they're wanting, they're threatened by intelligent people, very threatened because they... Well, I mean, they are, but I'm saying they're conscious in what they're doing.
[00:56:39.014 --> 00:56:40.955]  They, I agree that it's a mind trick.
[00:56:40.955 --> 00:56:43.655]  They believe they're smart because they're so cold-blooded.
[00:56:43.655 --> 00:56:46.316]  They believe that's a strength when really it's a weakness.
[00:56:46.316 --> 00:56:49.856]  So I agree with you on that point.
[00:56:49.856 --> 00:56:52.057]  And they're destroying human society.
[00:56:52.057 --> 00:56:59.078]  And I do believe the elite are delusional, allowing all this open-air, cross-species genetic engineering because it threatens their
[00:57:00.599 --> 00:57:08.964]  No, I don't agree with that.
[00:57:08.964 --> 00:57:10.104]  I'm sorry, you're a great guy.
[00:57:10.104 --> 00:57:14.627]  I really believe they have damaged DNA and they are destroying their own genetics.
[00:57:14.627 --> 00:57:18.850]  I doubt they're people who are very educated in nutrition.
[00:57:18.850 --> 00:57:22.092]  I doubt they're eating properly and they're inbreds.
[00:57:22.092 --> 00:57:25.434]  And I think they have damaged DNA and our society...
[00:57:25.734 --> 00:57:42.063]  with you this, the elites worldwide have interbred with other elites who tend to be cunning, manipulative, ruthless, sadistic, psychopathic, and so we are dealing with, whether they be Chinese or Jewish or European, German, whatever, they're basically, these elites are all the same in that they're ruthless.
[00:57:42.063 --> 00:57:45.064]  But I appreciate your call, ma'am.
[00:57:45.064 --> 00:57:45.725]  We're going to go to break.
[00:57:46.465 --> 00:57:46.565]  And
[00:58:06.288 --> 00:58:13.172]  There's going to be Alan Keyes, Dr. Chuck Baldwin are the keynote speakers for the Faith and Liberty Conference in Denver, Colorado.
[00:58:13.172 --> 00:58:30.961]  These distinguished patriots will be tackling the globalist orchestrated economic crisis along with the financial industry experts such as Don McAlvey, banking whistleblower George W. Hunt, privacy expert Dr. Patrick Albrecht, along with many others, Daryl Rundis,

[00:58:50.134 --> 00:58:54.337]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:58:54.337 --> 00:59:00.741]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:59:00.741 --> 00:59:08.127]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:59:08.127 --> 00:59:12.670]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:59:21.658 --> 00:59:25.922]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:59:25.922 --> 00:59:29.025]  As founder and owner for over 63 years,
[00:59:29.585 --> 00:59:32.667]  People keep asking me, how's business?
[00:59:32.667 --> 00:59:36.590]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:59:36.590 --> 00:59:48.898]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.

[00:59:55.623 --> 00:59:58.425]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.239 --> 01:00:10.064]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.064 --> 01:00:11.645]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.645 --> 01:00:13.207]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.207 --> 01:00:17.390]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:21.454]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.495 --> 01:00:25.357]  We're live at tower number two.
[01:00:25.357 --> 01:00:27.278]  Leah, Tony, Eddie Taylor and others.
[01:00:27.278 --> 01:00:28.579]  I'm going to get to all of you.
[01:00:28.579 --> 01:00:32.821]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:32.821 --> 01:00:37.464]  Paul Watson coming up in the next segment to talk about road warrior level collapse imminent.
[01:00:38.104 --> 01:00:39.105]  How do we avert this?
[01:00:39.105 --> 01:00:42.027]  How do we bring the globalists that have orchestrated this to justice?
[01:00:42.027 --> 01:00:54.116]  We'll also talk about top-level Clinton official, only a terror attack can save Obama, and a bunch of other news that is coming out that we haven't even gotten to yet, dealing with Arizona, the borders, the BP oil leak.
[01:00:54.116 --> 01:00:54.997]  They claim it's fixed.
[01:00:54.997 --> 01:00:56.017]  They've said this many times.
[01:00:56.017 --> 01:00:57.659]  We hope this is the case.
[01:00:57.659 --> 01:00:59.020]  That's all coming up.
[01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:01.522]  But right now, Leah in Kentucky, you're on the air.
[01:01:01.522 --> 01:01:01.822]  Welcome.
[01:01:03.124 --> 01:01:05.305]  Hi Alex, thank you.
[01:01:05.305 --> 01:01:16.449]  I just wanted to compliment you, first of all, on your excellent breakdown of the playbook from The Economic Hitman in your emergency message.
[01:01:16.449 --> 01:01:20.311]  I think this is vital to people's understanding.
[01:01:20.311 --> 01:01:30.335]  I know when I try to wake people up, two of the disconnects that I find are, one, well, the economy's just not doing well now, but you know that happens.
[01:01:31.152 --> 01:01:37.375]  And with that disconnect, what they need to understand is that it is being destroyed by design.
[01:01:37.375 --> 01:01:49.961]  The second thing they could be missing is that when an economy is destroyed by design, it's a very, very bad sign for that group of people being destroyed.
[01:01:49.961 --> 01:01:55.324]  And I think a good example of this is what happened in some cases to Native Americans.
[01:01:55.324 --> 01:01:57.365]  You take control of their economy
[01:01:58.021 --> 01:01:58.942]  I think so.
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:28.006]  And you take them, you re-educate them, you cut them off from resources, you put them on reservations, and then you basically incrementally wipe them out.
[01:02:28.006 --> 01:02:33.670]  And that's what's being done to everyone now, and that is the IMF World Bank model, economically.
[01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:36.513]  That is what Maurice Strong and the UN say.
[01:02:36.513 --> 01:02:37.774]  That's what the carbon tax is.
[01:02:37.774 --> 01:02:43.058]  It is meant to destroy industrial societies, to render us weak.
[01:02:43.058 --> 01:02:47.101]  And I mean, here's Time Magazine, the only child myth.
[01:02:47.101 --> 01:02:48.242]  And I knew when I saw this,
[01:02:49.295 --> 01:02:55.279]  Before I got it off the newsstand, I knew what it would say when I opened up the article and it says, the economy's bad.
[01:02:55.279 --> 01:02:57.521]  The answer is don't have more than one child.
[01:02:57.521 --> 01:03:01.724]  It's better for your carbon footprint to only have one or no children.
[01:03:01.724 --> 01:03:04.406]  This is all being pushed everywhere.
[01:03:04.406 --> 01:03:07.709]  The globalists have gotten the world through fraud.
[01:03:07.709 --> 01:03:09.670]  Now they don't want to enslave us.
[01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:12.172]  They want to enslave us so they can then kill us.
[01:03:12.172 --> 01:03:15.975]  And people better get the magnitude of this through their brains.
[01:03:15.975 --> 01:03:16.335]  Exactly.
[01:03:16.335 --> 01:03:16.916]  Exactly.
[01:03:16.916 --> 01:03:18.517]  So I had an idea of a call
[01:03:18.916 --> 01:03:19.416]  I know a lot
[01:03:36.266 --> 01:03:38.929]  Peaceful and proactive steps that they can take.
[01:03:38.929 --> 01:03:39.850]  Use that fourth hour.
[01:03:39.850 --> 01:03:40.812]  Start today.
[01:03:40.812 --> 01:03:51.645]  Listen, I agree with you, but also you heard the earlier caller talk about how he's gotten together with his neighbors and they're having meetings every week about what they're going to do during this collapse.
[01:03:52.165 --> 01:03:58.968]  Nothing is more valuable than friends and family you can count on, and knowing something's coming before it fully arrives.
[01:03:58.968 --> 01:04:02.930]  Now we're already into it, but we've only sunk a little bit into this.
[01:04:02.930 --> 01:04:08.532]  And again, if we point out the globalists have engineered this, they will have to back off and put the brakes on it.
[01:04:08.532 --> 01:04:14.575]  But if they think they can get away with creating the crisis and getting more power out of it, they're going to accelerate it.
[01:04:14.575 --> 01:04:21.278]  As Thomas Jefferson said, the level of tyranny you will live under is the exact point that you start resisting.
[01:04:22.379 --> 01:04:25.041]  The sky's the limit with these people.
[01:04:25.041 --> 01:04:25.842]  Absolutely.
[01:04:25.842 --> 01:04:26.303]  Absolutely.
[01:04:26.303 --> 01:04:27.344]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[01:04:27.344 --> 01:04:28.645]  We pray for you every day.
[01:04:28.645 --> 01:04:29.125]  Thank you.
[01:04:29.125 --> 01:04:31.788]  I can feel your prayers in my spirit.
[01:04:31.788 --> 01:04:32.609]  And God bless you.
[01:04:32.609 --> 01:04:35.712]  I appreciate your prayers more than you can imagine.
[01:04:37.554 --> 01:04:39.055]  Well, you can probably actually imagine it.
[01:04:39.055 --> 01:04:40.755]  You can feel other people's prayers for you.
[01:04:40.755 --> 01:04:44.617]  And I pray for all of you and this entire planet every day.
[01:04:44.617 --> 01:04:57.282]  And I pray that God will lift up other leaders worldwide, whether you're listening in Mexico or Russia or Japan or Germany, whether you're listening in Israel or England or South Africa, that you will realize that God needs you to be a leader.
[01:04:57.282 --> 01:04:57.963]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:57.963 --> 01:04:58.303]  Stay with us.
[01:05:02.145 --> 01:05:06.106]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:06.106 --> 01:05:14.969]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:05:14.969 --> 01:05:19.590]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:05:19.590 --> 01:05:30.413]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:05:31.053 --> 01:05:40.555]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:40.555 --> 01:05:45.977]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:05:45.977 --> 01:05:53.478]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:53.478 --> 01:05:56.219]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:05:59.977 --> 01:06:04.521]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:04.521 --> 01:06:05.441]  Number 1.
[01:06:05.441 --> 01:06:08.864]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:08.864 --> 01:06:09.725]  Number 2.
[01:06:09.725 --> 01:06:14.608]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:14.608 --> 01:06:15.349]  It's true.
[01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:20.233]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:20.233 --> 01:06:21.053]  Number 3.
[01:06:21.053 --> 01:06:24.636]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:24.636 --> 01:06:28.339]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:28.539 --> 01:06:29.339]  Number 4.
[01:06:29.339 --> 01:06:32.100]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:35.781]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:35.781 --> 01:06:36.561]  Number 5.
[01:06:36.561 --> 01:06:40.702]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:40.702 --> 01:06:45.764]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:06:45.764 --> 01:06:49.945]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:00.609]  Listen up, folks.
[01:07:00.609 --> 01:07:01.550]  This is important.
[01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:02.650]  Alex Jones here.

[01:08:00.985 --> 01:08:06.529]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.727 --> 01:08:14.671]  Waging war on corruption, crashing lies and disinformation.
[01:08:14.671 --> 01:08:15.492]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:08:15.492 --> 01:08:18.274]  We're now eight minutes into the second hour today.
[01:08:18.274 --> 01:08:21.036]  I'm going to get into raw story study.
[01:08:21.036 --> 01:08:24.519]  Attack on Iran would be start of long war.
[01:08:24.519 --> 01:08:28.682]  Oxford Research Group concludes Israeli attack on Iran would be start of long war.
[01:08:28.682 --> 01:08:30.584]  That's also zero hedge.
[01:08:30.584 --> 01:08:30.904]  U.S.
[01:08:30.904 --> 01:08:34.967]  paid Iranian nuclear scientist $5 million for aid to CIA, officials said.
[01:08:35.988 --> 01:08:53.377]  Washington time that's just some of what is coming up also cap-and-trade bill will be added to the Senate climate change bill so they're moving ahead with that they're on the verge of passing a Federal Reserve takeover the United States that dwarfs
[01:08:54.591 --> 01:08:59.215]  The beachhead they got in 1913, 97 years ago.
[01:08:59.215 --> 01:09:05.841]  Justice Department says they're not going to sue the 800-plus sanctuary cities where illegal aliens are above the law.
[01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:11.406]  That's okay that they won't work with the feds, because the feds don't want them to, but they are going to continue suing Arizona.
[01:09:11.406 --> 01:09:13.929]  Also, BP's reporting that they've fixed the leak.
[01:09:13.929 --> 01:09:16.191]  Let me cover that now, then we're going to Paul Watson.
[01:09:16.191 --> 01:09:17.412]  BP leak fixed.
[01:09:17.412 --> 01:09:21.355]  USA Today reports gulf well test to begin soon.
[01:09:22.136 --> 01:09:25.299]  They claim that oil is now stopped.
[01:09:25.299 --> 01:09:28.021]  Now, they've said this three times that I can remember.
[01:09:28.021 --> 01:09:29.322]  You probably remember more.
[01:09:29.322 --> 01:09:38.250]  BP plans to move forward soon on a critical and repeatedly delayed test of its Gulf well after fixing a leak on the new cap designed to contain the gushing oil.
[01:09:39.111 --> 01:09:40.232]  So I guess they're spinning it.
[01:09:40.232 --> 01:09:41.834]  It's not a complete cap.
[01:09:41.834 --> 01:09:42.955]  We sure wish that would be the case.
[01:09:42.955 --> 01:09:51.104]  The test of the Wells pressure could begin later in the day, BP Senior Vice President Kent Wells told reporters Thursday during a morning technical briefing.
[01:09:51.104 --> 01:09:56.810]  We're going to keep moving forward with this, Wells said, adding that the leak came as a surprise.
[01:09:56.810 --> 01:10:00.374]  We are always prepared for it, but I would say we didn't expect it.
[01:10:01.486 --> 01:10:06.170]  So, we'll see if that really is a capping of it or just more spin.
[01:10:06.170 --> 01:10:10.534]  In fact, guys, will you pull up the live webcam of it and see if it's leaking?
[01:10:10.534 --> 01:10:14.817]  I mean, they've lied so many times, who even knows what that means.
[01:10:14.817 --> 01:10:19.741]  Oh, also on the BP oil leak situation, what is it, day 85, 86 now?
[01:10:19.741 --> 01:10:26.867]  Government expert witnessed over 42 million gallons, not a million and a half, but 42 million gallons of dispersant used
[01:10:27.327 --> 01:10:32.809]  During BP oil disaster, much more toxic than the crude oil itself.
[01:10:32.809 --> 01:10:43.032]  But for the balance of the hour, Paul Joseph Watson, who of course works with the Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com team, he is the editor of PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:10:43.732 --> 01:10:45.393]  My second largest site.
[01:10:45.393 --> 01:10:48.615]  Of course, Infowars.com is the main flagship.
[01:10:48.615 --> 01:10:57.519]  And the sites continue to reach more and more people every day because of all of you spreading the word about the important news and analysis posted and linked there on the sites each and every day.
[01:10:57.519 --> 01:10:59.921]  I wanted to go over this with Watson.
[01:10:59.921 --> 01:11:02.762]  America stands on the precipice of total collapse.
[01:11:02.762 --> 01:11:03.683]  His latest article.
[01:11:04.423 --> 01:11:13.850]  That's a key video posted at the bottom of it titled, Road Warrior Level Collapse Imminent If We Don't Take Corrective Action Now, as they announce.
[01:11:14.955 --> 01:11:17.297]  Laying off government people at the state and local level.
[01:11:17.297 --> 01:11:20.519]  Laying off more than half of major police departments and sheriff's departments.
[01:11:20.519 --> 01:11:22.620]  Police not responding to major crime.
[01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:26.143]  The feds blocking any type of rescue of Arizona.
[01:11:26.143 --> 01:11:27.363]  That is all coming up.
[01:11:27.363 --> 01:11:31.506]  Mass foreclosures this year expected to eclipse 09 levels.
[01:11:31.506 --> 01:11:33.267]  World at risk of folding in on itself.
[01:11:33.267 --> 01:11:35.509]  CNBC reports.
[01:11:35.509 --> 01:11:39.692]  So that's just some of what we're going to be discussing.
[01:11:39.692 --> 01:11:44.014]  And then also, this Financial Times of London article from two days ago.
[01:11:45.175 --> 01:11:47.076]  We can't stress how important this is.
[01:11:47.076 --> 01:11:58.458]  Obama faces growing credibility crisis and it goes on to say the bottom line here, Robert Shapiro, top Clinton advisor said, is that Americans don't believe in President Obama's leadership, says Robert Shapiro.
[01:11:58.458 --> 01:12:10.261]  He says he has to find some way between now and November of demonstrating that he is a leader who can command confidence short of a 9-11 event or Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:12:10.261 --> 01:12:12.402]  I can't think of how he could do just that.
[01:12:12.402 --> 01:12:12.962]  And Watson
[01:12:14.568 --> 01:12:22.030]  Wrote a detailed article breaking down all the past statements of people in government talking about how they want more giant terror attacks.
[01:12:22.030 --> 01:12:23.470]  They have the motive for it.
[01:12:23.470 --> 01:12:24.850]  And you'll research each event.
[01:12:24.850 --> 01:12:26.250]  They're behind it.
[01:12:26.250 --> 01:12:27.951]  But going to Paul Watson now.
[01:12:27.951 --> 01:12:34.512]  Paul, you want to get into the economic collapse first and the fact that they're now admitting depression and what we do about that?
[01:12:34.512 --> 01:12:38.713]  Or do you want to get into the top Clinton official, only a terror attack and save Obama?
[01:12:40.472 --> 01:12:42.434]  Hello Alex, good to be back.
[01:12:42.434 --> 01:13:01.093]  Yeah, I think if we get into the economic collapse information first, I mean, they both kind of tie into each other, but it's not just Alex Jones or me or, you know, Celente or Peter Schiff saying this, that there will be a collapse within the next two years.
[01:13:03.726 --> 01:13:05.468]  It's the insiders themselves.
[01:13:05.468 --> 01:13:06.409]  It's the elitists.
[01:13:06.409 --> 01:13:07.911]  Yeah, that's the Forbes headline.
[01:13:07.911 --> 01:13:09.773]  Time to get out of the dollar.
[01:13:09.773 --> 01:13:15.039]  Just like they signaled time to implode the housing market when they had built the bubble, saying it would never end.
[01:13:15.039 --> 01:13:19.283]  I saw them signaling that in 2007 into 2008, I warn people.
[01:13:19.283 --> 01:13:20.445]  Now they're signaling again.
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:40.871]  Yeah, and I mean, uh, this is not just coming from us, it's coming from people like Niall Ferguson, who is, uh, you know, the big Harvard history professor, economics professor, and, uh, he's a member of both the Bilderberg Group, he went to the last two meetings, and also the Aspen Institute.
[01:13:40.871 --> 01:13:43.853]  And he's saying the biggest collapse, what, since 16, er, since 1730?
[01:13:46.325 --> 01:13:47.546]  Basically, yeah.
[01:13:47.546 --> 01:13:50.707]  He's saying a sudden and total collapse within two years.
[01:13:50.707 --> 01:13:56.549]  He said it's going to be rapid, it's going to happen quickly, it's not going to linger on.
[01:13:56.549 --> 01:14:10.095]  And that it's going to be a Greek-style meltdown, but on a much bigger scale, because of course, you know, America stands to lose much more than Greece, because many more people are going to be caught up in this kind of chaos.
[01:14:10.095 --> 01:14:14.637]  And the Chinese have now downgraded European and US T-bills.
[01:14:16.547 --> 01:14:18.549]  Yeah, it's all coming to a head now.
[01:14:18.549 --> 01:14:41.448]  We're being told that we've got to accept this age of austerity, the financial terrorists that caused the collapse, that stole trillions of dollars that were given to them by our governments, now saying that we're going to have to make up the shortfall by sacrificing public services, paying more taxes, our incomes are going to be capped.
[01:14:42.108 --> 01:14:47.653]  VAT in the UK is going to go up to 20% from January 2011.
[01:14:47.653 --> 01:14:50.556]  That's the sales tax.
[01:14:50.556 --> 01:14:54.799]  You pay 20% tax on most purchases.
[01:14:54.799 --> 01:15:01.625]  Obama and Volcker have said that a sales tax, a VAT tax for America is still on the table.
[01:15:01.625 --> 01:15:07.010]  And raise the social security retirement age to 70 and take part of people's pension funds bare minimum.
[01:15:07.010 --> 01:15:07.871]  It's all being announced.
[01:15:09.557 --> 01:15:13.347]  Yeah, I mean that's what the age of austerity is.
[01:15:13.347 --> 01:15:16.516]  But the thing that galls me about it is the fact that
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:28.264]  Last time this happened, certainly in Britain, was in the late 70s when we had the three-day week which was followed by these austerity measures.
[01:15:28.264 --> 01:15:44.170]  The three-day week came as a result of miners going on strike and we had to conserve electricity so the working week was shortened to three days and this is exactly what's coming in again with this post-industrial revolution, this green economy.
[01:15:44.170 --> 01:15:45.331]  But in the 70s, which is
[01:15:46.491 --> 01:15:51.358]  You know, people are saying that this economic meltdown's worse than it was in the 70s now.
[01:15:51.358 --> 01:15:56.205]  But we had these austerity measures very similar to what's coming in now.
[01:15:56.205 --> 01:15:58.489]  And public spending was cut by a mere 4%.
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:23.070]  And as a result of that 4% cut in public services in Britain at the time, basically there were widespread strikes, there were riots, there were bodies left unburied, and at the time the German Chancellor said that as a result of this, quote, Britain was no longer a developed country.
[01:16:23.630 --> 01:16:28.673]  That all came as a result of 4% cut in public spending.
[01:16:28.673 --> 01:16:34.176]  So now they're saying that it's going to be 20% plus cuts in public spending.
[01:16:34.176 --> 01:16:41.279]  So what we're going to experience in the next few years is going to be four times worse than anything that happened in the 70s.
[01:16:41.279 --> 01:16:51.465]  And to be clear, when they talk about 20% cuts in public spending, they're going to increase taxes, so there'll be more money overall, but it's all going to go to the offshore banks.
[01:16:52.025 --> 01:16:52.765]  We're good to go.
[01:17:14.076 --> 01:17:23.200]  Meanwhile, they're announcing in China, in the Associated Press, as if it's a good thing that they lock everyone down at night inside their homes and you're not allowed out on the streets at night.
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:24.901]  So this is the globalist model.
[01:17:24.901 --> 01:17:25.561]  Total control.
[01:17:27.116 --> 01:17:32.379]  Yeah, and that's what Joe Lieberman wants the internet to be like, the Chinese internet as well.
[01:17:32.379 --> 01:17:38.822]  So China's the model for what they're moving towards, and part of it's going to come with this austerity fascism.
[01:17:38.822 --> 01:17:48.446]  I wrote an article last month called Austerity Fascism Is Coming And It Will Be Brutal, and I go through all the measures that they will introduce.
[01:17:49.747 --> 01:17:58.573]  To move towards these austerity measures and these public cuts, income tax raises, you know, caps on income.
[01:17:58.573 --> 01:18:08.080]  And to think that people basically, a lot of them nearly went over the edge as a result of 4% cuts and now they're talking about 20+.
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:11.783]  People's survival mechanisms are basically going to be on a hair trigger.
[01:18:11.923 --> 01:18:21.117]  And that's why we go back to the 2007 British Ministry of Defence report where they said by 2012 total collapse in martial law because this is being orchestrated.
[01:18:22.725 --> 01:18:24.766]  Yeah, but people aren't used to it.
[01:18:24.766 --> 01:18:37.656]  You know, people go along in their lives worshipping LeBron James and everyone and they think that the world around them is just going to stay the same forever if they're not involved in it and if they just stick their head in the ground.
[01:18:37.656 --> 01:18:49.544]  But once these austerity measures start to impact them directly, you know, and their pay gets capped, they lose their jobs, their welfare gets cut in half, then we're certainly going to see
[01:18:50.405 --> 01:18:53.608]  You know, how thin the veneer of civilization is.
[01:18:53.608 --> 01:18:56.831]  Because these people are not going to like what's happening to them.
[01:18:56.831 --> 01:18:58.452]  And it's partly their own fault.
[01:18:58.452 --> 01:19:04.077]  Because, you know, they've sold themselves to the couch potato lifestyle.
[01:19:04.077 --> 01:19:12.123]  And the giant horde of lazy, dumbed-down people are going to be used as a weapon by the government and the corporations against the producers.
[01:19:12.123 --> 01:19:17.288]  And they're going to use this wave of panic to fully rob anyone who's actually done well in life.
[01:19:18.658 --> 01:19:21.020]  Exactly, and it's going to be class warfare.
[01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:37.751]  If people are prepared for this, and they've got reserves of, you know, gold and food and whatever, and they've got land and they've got places to go, and they can get through this, then the people who haven't prepared for it are going to be insane with jealousy, and it's going to create class warfare.
[01:19:37.751 --> 01:19:45.897]  And the ultra elite are going to point the giant horde against the tiny middle class and wipe it out, as they did in Nigeria, Argentina, South Africa.
[01:19:46.457 --> 01:19:47.638]  And countless other nations.
[01:19:47.638 --> 01:19:49.521]  We know this is an orchestrated plan.
[01:19:49.521 --> 01:19:51.042]  We have the IMF World Bank documents.
[01:19:51.042 --> 01:19:52.404]  Paul, stay there.
[01:19:52.404 --> 01:19:56.809]  Let's come back and talk about time frames for the collapse and how we try to avert it.
[01:19:56.809 --> 01:19:58.931]  Then we'll get into the attack on the internet and a lot more.
[01:19:58.931 --> 01:19:59.572]  And phone calls.
[01:19:59.572 --> 01:19:59.953]  Stay with us.
[01:20:01.311 --> 01:20:04.853]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:20:04.853 --> 01:20:07.134]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:20:07.134 --> 01:20:07.994]  Don't!
[01:20:07.994 --> 01:20:11.436]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[01:20:11.436 --> 01:20:18.559]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'

[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:24.202]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.

[01:20:27.746 --> 01:20:35.115]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[01:20:35.115 --> 01:20:36.316]  Herb K was right.

[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:40.760]  What do you have to lose?

[01:21:01.141 --> 01:21:06.105]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:21:06.105 --> 01:21:07.105]  What have we got?
[01:21:07.105 --> 01:21:09.567]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:21:09.567 --> 01:21:10.568]  A republic.
[01:21:10.568 --> 01:21:13.210]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:21:13.210 --> 01:21:15.472]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:21:15.472 --> 01:21:17.493]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:21:17.493 --> 01:21:19.174]  So they think they own our land?
[01:21:19.174 --> 01:21:20.495]  They think they own our water?
[01:21:20.495 --> 01:21:21.116]  Children?
[01:21:21.116 --> 01:21:22.237]  Our education?
[01:21:22.237 --> 01:21:23.077]  Our money?
[01:21:23.077 --> 01:21:26.720]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:32.046]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.

[01:21:33.067 --> 01:21:34.228]  We have the Constitution.
[01:21:34.228 --> 01:21:35.130]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:21:35.130 --> 01:21:36.031]  We have common law.
[01:21:36.031 --> 01:21:38.554]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:23:07.221 --> 01:23:14.868]  Benzene, a toxic gas emitted from crude oil and a known carcinogen, is now airborne traveling hundreds, even thousands of miles inland.
[01:23:14.868 --> 01:23:22.094]  Whether you live near the Gulf or not, benzene and other volatile organic compounds could cause adverse reactions to those living inside your home.
[01:23:22.094 --> 01:23:27.499]  NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, came to airfiltersandpurifiers.com for answers.
[01:23:27.679 --> 01:23:30.641]  On how to clean the air on boats, aiding in the Gulf Cleanup.

[01:24:06.295 --> 01:24:08.817]  Okay, going back to Paul Watson.
[01:24:08.817 --> 01:24:18.545]  Paul, yeah, mainstream news is saying the next year or two depression, but all the economic numbers show at least three years we've been in a deep recession going into depression.
[01:24:18.545 --> 01:24:20.226]  Now they're announcing it.
[01:24:20.226 --> 01:24:23.089]  They're now trying to form this new global SDR system.
[01:24:23.089 --> 01:24:29.274]  You know, Salente says by the end of this year we'll be in a total collapse.
[01:24:29.274 --> 01:24:30.715]  I hope that's not the case, but
[01:24:31.235 --> 01:24:40.779]  When Schwarzenegger's already telling state employees they're going to get minimum wage and police departments coast-to-coast are laying people off saying they won't respond to crime, but taxes are going up.
[01:24:40.779 --> 01:24:42.259]  I mean, this is amazing.
[01:24:42.259 --> 01:24:43.960]  What's your take on the collapse?
[01:24:45.865 --> 01:25:08.800]  Well, certainly they're infuriated about the fact that all these anti-incumbent candidates are threatening the establishment members, people like Harry Reid, you know, his opponent, the Tea Party member, as being completely lambasted by the mainstream media because she supports the Oath Keepers, she supports getting the fluoride out of the water.
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:15.645]  But those people, those kind of people are really starting to challenge the establishment minions, so that's November.
[01:25:15.905 --> 01:25:16.125]  That's
[01:25:32.799 --> 01:25:42.904]  You know, the people who would normally be deriding us as paranoid alarmists, the big establishment media people, are saying exactly the same thing.
[01:25:42.904 --> 01:25:46.586]  And in fact, some of them are even going further than we are.
[01:25:46.586 --> 01:25:47.167]  For example,
[01:25:47.967 --> 01:25:54.030]  There's a guy called Simon Sharma, who is the most recognised historian in Britain.
[01:25:54.030 --> 01:26:00.452]  You know, he presents all the BBC and History Channel documentaries, all the new ones that come out.
[01:26:00.452 --> 01:26:08.456]  And, again, this is in the Financial Times, that's where they announce all this, because it's a Bilderberg-owned paper, they know the vast majority of the
[01:26:09.196 --> 01:26:09.396]  So
[01:26:23.376 --> 01:26:47.396]  Not only will there be a collapse, an economic collapse, civil unrest, you know, mass riots, but there's also the very real prospect of a revolution, and he's talking about in America, because the elite might allow the chaos to get completely out of hand and allow people to get a foot in the door on actually wrestling back control of the system.
[01:26:47.396 --> 01:26:51.300]  And this is a guy who's intimately tied into the establishment
[01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:56.365]  Well, that's the same things that Bignam Rzezinski said two months ago.
[01:26:56.365 --> 01:26:57.185]  Yeah.
[01:26:57.185 --> 01:27:11.239]  So, in a sense, they're going even further than us in saying that not only is there going to be mass unrest and riots and a collapse, but it may even lead to a complete kind of coup d'etat on behalf of the people.
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:23.864]  Well, that's the big issue, is that either the globalists get unbelievable expansions of power out of the crisis they've engineered, or we use it to restore the republic and restore free nations worldwide.
[01:27:23.864 --> 01:27:29.365]  And they're going to win in some nations, we're going to lose in some nations, we're going to win in some nations.
[01:27:29.365 --> 01:27:32.366]  But the fight is on.
[01:27:32.366 --> 01:27:37.048]  Yeah, and I mean, Sharma said that, this is his quote,
[01:27:37.958 --> 01:27:43.843]  that the American people could quote bring down the governance of the American Republic.
[01:27:43.843 --> 01:28:02.659]  He's talking about the people overthrowing the government and this is a this is a massively respected historian but the key thing is he says that the only way that the elite will prevent this from happening if they allow the crisis the unrest to get out of hand is by Obama becoming basically a dictator
[01:28:02.819 --> 01:28:05.220]  An authoritarian enforcer.
[01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:13.063]  And we know how he's going to do that, which ties into the Shapiro quote out of the Financial Times just a couple of days ago.
[01:28:13.063 --> 01:28:21.405]  And we're going to cover that in a moment, but look at not just Woody Allen and all these other people calling for Obama to be a dictator.
[01:28:21.405 --> 01:28:28.468]  We have the system itself, and we had the Financial Times of London a year and a half ago with the headline, and now for world government,
[01:28:29.048 --> 01:28:38.493]  With the head editor for the International Affairs, who's been a Bilderberg attendee, saying, yes, it's authoritarian, yes, it's been secret, but it's for your own good.
[01:28:38.493 --> 01:28:41.595]  So they're now coming out saying, tyranny is good.
[01:28:41.595 --> 01:28:43.016]  They're not even denying it now.
[01:28:44.574 --> 01:28:52.500]  No, and it's also coming from the left wing with the climate change movement saying we need dictators to save the environment.
[01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:57.064]  We need to see the end of democracy if the earth is to survive global warming.
[01:28:57.064 --> 01:28:59.766]  So it's coming from every side.
[01:28:59.766 --> 01:29:10.335]  And if they are to ram through the majority of what they want in this anemic post-industrial revolution, then yeah, they're going to have to get hardcore.
[01:29:10.335 --> 01:29:12.296]  They're going to have to get brutal.
[01:29:12.296 --> 01:29:12.556]  I mean,
[01:29:13.317 --> 01:29:23.262]  As I was talking about before, when we last had this austerity fascism in the United Kingdom, the top bracket of income tax was 98%.
[01:29:23.262 --> 01:29:29.265]  Anyone earning over £20,000 a year had to pay 98% of that top bracket to the government.
[01:29:29.265 --> 01:29:32.066]  They're not going to get that through without some fascism along the way.
[01:29:34.295 --> 01:29:35.896]  Stay there, Watson.
[01:29:35.896 --> 01:29:40.219]  We're gonna talk more about this when we get back on the type of terror attacks they may be planning to stage.
[01:29:40.219 --> 01:29:44.362]  Now, why would ultra-rich want a 90-plus percent tax bracket?
[01:29:44.362 --> 01:29:45.543]  Because they're offshore.
[01:29:45.543 --> 01:29:51.127]  They take your money domestically, ship it offshore.
[01:29:51.127 --> 01:29:52.528]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.528 --> 01:29:55.050]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.050 --> 01:29:57.731]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:33:12.210 --> 01:33:13.110]  We are back live.
[01:33:13.110 --> 01:33:17.312]  Thank you so much for joining us on this July 15, 2010, live Thursday edition.
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:25.605]  Don't forget I'll be back this Sunday with the abbreviated broadcast 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:25.605 --> 01:33:27.848]  Central Time as well.
[01:33:27.848 --> 01:33:34.395]  We have the free podcast with close to 300,000 people downloading it a day at InfoWars.com on the listen page.
[01:33:34.395 --> 01:33:36.518]  We have the free iPhone app you can download for free.
[01:33:36.518 --> 01:33:37.699]  Listen how you want, where you want.
[01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:44.085]  Whenever you want, we have an Android app up there as well, all available for free at InfoWars.com.
[01:33:44.085 --> 01:33:49.009]  And of course, you're listening to us on the AM and FM dial, shortwave, global satellite, XM.
[01:33:49.009 --> 01:33:52.552]  Just keep spreading the word to your friends and family, how they can tune in.
[01:33:52.552 --> 01:33:56.696]  Anybody can tune in, shortwave, satellite, internet, AM, FM.
[01:33:56.696 --> 01:34:02.241]  There's always a way for you to listen and we continue to reach more people and shed light on these criminals because you are supporting us.
[01:34:02.241 --> 01:34:04.342]  We're going back to Paul Watson in a moment to talk about
[01:34:05.263 --> 01:34:12.745]  Staged crises, fake cyber attacks to bring in total control of the web, new terror attacks to be blamed on domestic groups.
[01:34:12.745 --> 01:34:15.686]  The globalists are clearly green-lighting that.
[01:34:15.686 --> 01:34:21.668]  The oil well spill, all of it, the Iran situation, and then Tony, Taylor, Tim, Alex, Jeff, and others.
[01:34:21.668 --> 01:34:24.749]  Huge news blitzes and key video and audio clips and analysis.
[01:34:25.169 --> 01:34:25.510]  All right.
[01:34:40.451 --> 01:34:45.056]  Installment plan right now if you want to make three payments over three months.
[01:34:45.056 --> 01:34:46.637]  They've got that going for a limited time.
[01:34:46.637 --> 01:34:53.284]  High quality atmospheric water generators that grab the water vapor out of the air and condense it and put it through filters.
[01:34:53.284 --> 01:34:54.785]  They've got a bunch of different units.
[01:34:54.785 --> 01:34:55.946]  ColaBlue.com or 800-691-6043.
[01:35:03.113 --> 01:35:06.876]  And lastly, I want to tell you about MySolarBackup.com.
[01:35:06.876 --> 01:35:10.679]  Have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[01:35:10.679 --> 01:35:17.605]  If so, you should check out MySolarBackup.com, because there's never been a better time to start getting off the grid and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[01:35:17.605 --> 01:35:18.506]  Here's why.
[01:35:18.506 --> 01:35:24.971]  Plug-and-play solar generators that our listeners have loved are available from the great folks at Solutions from Science.
[01:35:24.971 --> 01:35:28.053]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly and emits no fumes.
[01:35:28.053 --> 01:35:30.155]  It's like having your own electrical power plant.
[01:35:30.155 --> 01:35:32.177]  It's perfect for your home or your campsite or your shop.
[01:35:32.657 --> 01:35:43.040]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, or you want to pay the man as much energy bill money, check it out at MySolarBackup.com or call and get a free information pack at 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365.
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:46.481]  So again, AcolaBlue.com and MySolarBackup.com, great places to get self-sufficient today.
[01:35:46.481 --> 01:35:46.741]  And lastly,
[01:35:56.684 --> 01:35:59.185]  You know, we launched about a month ago a new shopping cart.
[01:35:59.185 --> 01:36:02.747]  And all the specials that are on that cart are also on our Yahoo cart.
[01:36:02.747 --> 01:36:04.749]  There's links to these in the shop button.
[01:36:05.811 --> 01:36:06.111]  I think so.
[01:36:30.692 --> 01:36:41.928]  Two t-shirts and a free ball cap and we've got a lot of great t-shirts that are designed to get the word out like legalized freedom with a image of the American flag with barbed wire making the stripes.
[01:36:41.928 --> 01:36:43.250]  People will say what does that mean?
[01:36:43.250 --> 01:36:46.856]  Now you can stripe up a conversation or if you run into a patriot
[01:36:47.256 --> 01:36:47.756]  We're good to go.
[01:37:06.610 --> 01:37:08.270]  Or you can simply write to us at P.O.
[01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:12.092]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[01:37:12.092 --> 01:37:15.833]  Okay, going back to Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:37:15.833 --> 01:37:19.914]  Paul, top Clinton official, only a terror attack can save Obama.
[01:37:19.914 --> 01:37:24.115]  Again, in the true paper of record, where the globalists speak, where the Bilderbergs own the paper.
[01:37:24.815 --> 01:37:37.846]  They are saying, this is a paper for them to communicate with each other, that Obama needs an Oklahoma City or a 9-11, and if he can't have one of those so he can rally as a strong leader, then he is going to be destroyed.
[01:37:37.846 --> 01:37:40.868]  Shapiro said, this is chilling information.
[01:37:40.868 --> 01:37:50.637]  But remember, going back a year ago and accelerating the last three or four months, I've been saying I could see them in all these HBO and MSNBC and CNN documentaries.
[01:37:51.664 --> 01:38:08.889]  And in ADL reports, Southern Poverty Law Center, Pentagon reports, MIAC reports, Homeland Security, law enforcement, brainwashing reports, propaganda reports saying gun owners, libertarians, conservatives, Tea Partiers, in the fetters, Ron Paul supporters, Alex Jones supporters, they want to kill cops.
[01:38:08.889 --> 01:38:10.409]  They want to blow up buildings.
[01:38:10.409 --> 01:38:12.790]  Turns out the Hattari was totally fake like we told you.
[01:38:13.810 --> 01:38:16.311]  Eight months before they got busted, I could see them being set up.
[01:38:16.311 --> 01:38:17.551]  I said that on air.
[01:38:17.551 --> 01:38:21.031]  Out of 400-plus militias, I identified them as being infiltrated.
[01:38:21.031 --> 01:38:22.692]  Turned out that was the case.
[01:38:22.692 --> 01:38:26.432]  But it turned out it was the feds that were basically shooting their mouths off, so that was a setup.
[01:38:26.432 --> 01:38:36.394]  They are clearly getting ready to stage terror attacks to be blamed on the American people, and terror attacks to be blamed on Iran, and a cyber attack as an excuse to take over the web.
[01:38:36.394 --> 01:38:40.395]  And, of course, now we have the economist, chief economist at the World Bank, excuse me, IMF,
[01:38:41.255 --> 01:38:45.418]  Telling the Korea Times that, yes, they're going to use the oil spill for a carbon tax.
[01:38:45.418 --> 01:38:52.604]  You can see their methodology of problem, reaction, solution and using crises at work here like never before.
[01:38:52.604 --> 01:38:54.265]  And they're so transparent.
[01:38:54.265 --> 01:38:55.226]  Watson, break it down.
[01:38:56.991 --> 01:39:02.596]  Well, it's almost a mirror image of the situation in the mid-90s with Clinton.
[01:39:02.596 --> 01:39:09.161]  I mean, Clinton didn't have much higher approval ratings in early 95 than Obama does now.
[01:39:09.161 --> 01:39:10.863]  He was a little bit higher.
[01:39:10.863 --> 01:39:22.532]  But of course, as soon as the Oklahoma City bombing happened, which was of course completely run by the FBI through their stooge, their patsy Timothy McVeigh, now that's completely out in the open.
[01:39:24.213 --> 01:39:45.480]  Clinton went up to back around 60% and this conservative revolution as it was at the time that threatened the power monopoly was completely crushed and they were able to demonize their political opposition as right-wing fringe extremists who should be completely ignored and that's what we see happening again today.
[01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:52.083]  Sharon Angle, as I mentioned before, this challenger to the Senate Democrat Harry Reid,
[01:39:53.243 --> 01:40:09.766]  has got a good chance of beating him which is why the established media is out in force saying that she's a right-wing extremist just because she supports people upholding their oath to the constitution and wants to get the deadly neurotoxin sodium fluoride out of the water.
[01:40:10.366 --> 01:40:24.684]  So, with people like that really having a chance of wrestling back some of the power from the establishment in Washington DC, they need some kind of event which they can exploit to demonize their political opposition.
[01:40:24.684 --> 01:40:27.968]  And when you've got people like Rahm Emanuel,
[01:40:28.669 --> 01:40:42.240]  Being the chief string puller for Obama, who is a complete puppet and merely reads off a teleprompter, the real power in that administration is certainly with Rahm Emanuel, to a point.
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:48.584]  And he's a son of an Israeli terrorist who planned the bombings of hotels and marketplaces.
[01:40:48.584 --> 01:40:52.988]  He was in the Irgun terrorist group that killed hundreds of people.
[01:40:53.428 --> 01:41:12.602]  So when you've got people like that advising Obama and, you know, never let a good crisis go to waste, and then you read in the Financial Times that this big Obama supporter Shapiro is saying that basically we need a terror attack otherwise Obama's finished, then I think we should be a little bit concerned about it.
[01:41:13.697 --> 01:41:19.640]  Well, you can see the preparatory brainwashing, so people think the mainstream media, boy, they're really on target.
[01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:21.761]  The right-wingers did blow up a federal building.
[01:41:21.761 --> 01:41:24.142]  Darn them, we've got to get their guns.
[01:41:24.142 --> 01:41:31.926]  My gosh, I also see an attempted assassination, God forbid, we're against, I mean, we're totally against that happening, against Barack Obama.
[01:41:31.926 --> 01:41:36.269]  As a caller said last Sunday, the question is, will Obama be taken out by
[01:41:37.149 --> 01:41:41.872]  Impeachment or embalmment, and we hope that he is not taken out by embalmment.
[01:41:41.872 --> 01:41:49.956]  We want Obama, a teleprompter reading CIA agent from Indonesia, to certainly live a long life.
[01:41:49.956 --> 01:41:52.097]  We don't want that puppet to be turned into a martyr.
[01:41:52.097 --> 01:41:58.581]  You know, the same reason the globalists don't want to kill me is because they don't want to turn me into a martyr against their tyranny.
[01:41:58.581 --> 01:42:05.925]  We don't want the globalists to turn Obama or any of his criminal scallywags into some type of martyr as well.
[01:42:07.802 --> 01:42:10.444]  No, but it would be very easy for them to do that.
[01:42:10.444 --> 01:42:24.773]  If you look into exactly how much of a vacuous puppet Obama is, how much of a front man he is, it's transparent to see that he's just a water carrier for the elite and he could be replaced at any moment.
[01:42:24.773 --> 01:42:33.619]  You know, his speeches are written by Bilderberg members, his book was written by Bill Ayres, the domestic terrorist weather underground bomber,
[01:42:34.079 --> 01:42:38.662]  You know, everything he does is coordinated by somebody else standing behind the scenes.
[01:42:38.662 --> 01:42:42.505]  So, I mean, they could easily run a false flag against Obama.
[01:42:42.505 --> 01:42:53.752]  Well, it was declassified last year that Patty Hearst, you know, going in with machine guns provocatively and shooting it on 18mm film, that was all directed by the FBI and was staged.
[01:42:53.752 --> 01:42:54.953]  That's now been declassified.
[01:42:57.165 --> 01:42:59.286]  Yeah, so they've always got that tool.
[01:42:59.286 --> 01:43:10.734]  I mean, to a large extent it's been discredited and eviscerated by the fact that it's been so voluminously and repeatedly exposed since 9-11.
[01:43:10.734 --> 01:43:18.580]  But what I see happening is that they'll just let Obama wither and die and they'll get a Mitt Romney in and then we'll really see
[01:43:18.820 --> 01:43:19.040]  You know,
[01:43:39.516 --> 01:44:03.392]  That really on most of the issues would come down on our side on the constitutionalist libertarian side people like Rand Paul and as I mentioned before Sharon Angle but there's still this huge mass of people that will gleefully go to the polls in you know 2012 and just put Mitt Romney in and we'll just get you know George W Bush to again so
[01:44:04.292 --> 01:44:13.936]  I mean, that's the avenue I see them going down, but if it really gets out of hand with this economic collapse, then who knows what's going to happen.
[01:44:13.936 --> 01:44:14.716]  Good points, Paul.
[01:44:14.716 --> 01:44:20.439]  Let's look at a few other staged crises that they can pull off.
[01:44:20.439 --> 01:44:25.701]  I mean, I've got a few that I want to list here, but what are some of the other crises you see them using?
[01:44:28.046 --> 01:44:32.771]  Well obviously you've got the cyber security agenda.
[01:44:32.771 --> 01:44:45.123]  Lieberman, Joe Lieberman, the sponsor of this bill which would give Obama the power to flick a virtual kill switch to shut down the internet for at least four months before he had to get congressional approval.
[01:44:46.204 --> 01:45:04.915]  He openly unveiled the cyber security agenda for what it was last month in an interview with CNN's Candy Crowley when he said, quote, right now China, the government, can disconnect parts of its internet in case of war and we need to have that here too.
[01:45:04.915 --> 01:45:13.660]  So he's openly saying that cyber security is part of a move towards the Chinese style censorship and policing of the internet.
[01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:25.584]  Now, as I wrote in my article today, China's internet system has nothing whatsoever to do with, quote, war or security.
[01:45:25.584 --> 01:45:37.389]  It's all centred around keeping people politically oppressed and stopping them from communicating with each other and organising politically to get active.
[01:45:37.389 --> 01:45:38.029]  And it's about
[01:45:38.889 --> 01:45:43.472]  Censoring government atrocities and government cover-ups and government abuse.
[01:45:43.472 --> 01:45:48.655]  So Lieberman has openly said that that's what cyber security represents.
[01:45:48.655 --> 01:45:52.277]  Well we've got all these White House officials saying they want to censor it.
[01:45:52.277 --> 01:45:55.339]  We've got the FCC saying they want to control the internet.
[01:45:55.339 --> 01:45:58.100]  We've got them saying they want to put a tax on alternative media.
[01:45:58.100 --> 01:46:06.786]  That's an official proposal by the Federal Trade Commission and the FCC to tax alternative media to quote fund a government megaphone on TV
[01:46:07.586 --> 01:46:07.726]  I think?
[01:46:27.768 --> 01:46:37.291]  China's capital has started gating and locking some of its lower-income neighborhoods overnight, with police or security checking identification papers around the clock, and a throwback to the old style of control.
[01:46:37.291 --> 01:46:40.032]  They already do that in New York, where they search everybody out at night.
[01:46:40.032 --> 01:46:46.694]  It's Beijing's latest effort to reduce rising crime, often blamed on millions of rural Chinese migrating to the cities for New York.
[01:46:46.694 --> 01:46:47.955]  I mean, for work.
[01:46:47.955 --> 01:46:49.655]  I'm thinking of New York being a police state.
[01:46:49.655 --> 01:46:53.937]  The capital's Communist Party secretary warns the approach promoted citywide
[01:46:54.697 --> 01:47:04.702]  Uh, once it promoted citywide, but some state media and experts say the move not only looks bad, but imposes another layer of control on the already stigmatized vulnerable migrants.
[01:47:04.702 --> 01:47:15.047]  And so, so far the gates have sealed off 16 villages in the sprawling southern suburbs where migrants are attached to cheaper rents, and some villages outnumber permanent residents 10 to 1.
[01:47:18.075 --> 01:47:23.119]  Yeah, well, it's not surprising that the Associated Press would report that with pleasure.
[01:47:23.119 --> 01:47:26.842]  Because, as we said before, the Chinese system is the goal.
[01:47:26.842 --> 01:47:34.788]  In China, even in the rich cities like Shanghai, the richest cities, you've got a two-cast system.
[01:47:34.788 --> 01:47:39.732]  You've got the people who've got some wealth right up against the poor.
[01:47:39.732 --> 01:47:41.994]  And basically there's no middle class whatsoever.
[01:47:42.834 --> 01:47:45.636]  Um, the poor can live right next to the rich.
[01:47:45.636 --> 01:47:49.078]  You know, they basically live on the street as it is in places like Shanghai.
[01:47:49.078 --> 01:48:00.965]  Well, it's admitted that CPS doesn't take the children of millions of workers that chain their children all day to telephone poles or to light poles, and there's no environmental standards.
[01:48:00.965 --> 01:48:05.268]  They're having to put nets all over the factories for people jumping off, committing suicide.
[01:48:06.008 --> 01:48:07.768]  Meanwhile, this is what we're competing with.
[01:48:07.768 --> 01:48:17.990]  When we buy these goods, we are basically lowering ourselves to their level instead of demanding more tariffs so China has to raise its quality of life.
[01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:19.351]  It's actually a race to the bottom.
[01:48:19.351 --> 01:48:30.273]  Globalism, when Obama at the G20 in Toronto a few weeks ago talked about no nation can be greater than the other, he means all nations must be lowered, not raise the poor nations.
[01:48:30.273 --> 01:48:31.793]  Globalism is feudalism.
[01:48:33.410 --> 01:48:35.952]  Yeah, that's the whole point of the green economy.
[01:48:35.952 --> 01:48:41.696]  It's to lower first world nations to at least a second world status.
[01:48:41.696 --> 01:48:51.143]  And it's proved absolutely disastrous in Spain, where they've now got a 20% unemployment rate and 2.2 jobs are lost.
[01:48:51.263 --> 01:48:53.684]  For every quote, green job that's created.
[01:48:53.684 --> 01:48:54.745]  Mission accomplished.
[01:48:54.745 --> 01:49:03.049]  And you say, we're not against them, it's just amazing to see it, that now it's not Eastern Europeans and Arabs that are flooding England, but that it's people from Spain.
[01:49:03.049 --> 01:49:03.710]  There's an exodus.
[01:49:05.475 --> 01:49:13.881]  Yeah, every time I, you know, travel across the UK, I see tons and tons of Spanish people, which I never saw in the past.
[01:49:13.881 --> 01:49:19.525]  And they're not tourists, because, you know, they've got baby strollers and they're going home on the train.
[01:49:19.525 --> 01:49:31.694]  They've vacated Spain in their droves, because with this green economy, everything's crashing and burning, and they've got a, you know, double the unemployment rate that we've got in the UK, which is bad enough as it is.
[01:49:31.854 --> 01:49:33.477]  And that's what the New World Order is.
[01:49:33.477 --> 01:49:45.956]  The OECD and all of them state this, that they want a global government so there's nowhere to run and everywhere is, in fact I saw the OECD a decade ago say France is the model with an 80 plus percent income tax.
[01:49:47.858 --> 01:49:57.766]  Yeah, as I was saying before, you know, 80 plus percent income tax is not something that's out of the ordinary in the past hundred years.
[01:49:57.766 --> 01:50:08.035]  It's only in the past few decades that most Western nations have had this, you know, in the UK and the US it's 40 to 50 percent top bracket.
[01:50:09.096 --> 01:50:15.398]  In the UK in 1977, the nominal rate of income tax was 98%.
[01:50:15.398 --> 01:50:26.341]  Everything you earned over £20,000, which would be about $30,000, everything above that, the vast majority of it, went straight to the government.
[01:50:26.821 --> 01:50:41.230]  Now obviously we have to adjust for inflation in 2010, but on that scale, the middle class would cease to exist because you would never be able to earn anything above a subsistence level income bracket.
[01:50:41.230 --> 01:50:44.552]  Well, they're already trying to pass laws in England to keep you from leaving, Paul.
[01:50:44.552 --> 01:50:46.434]  I'm telling you, you got to get out of there.
[01:50:47.034 --> 01:50:59.289]  You need to get out of there, or that bloodthirsty German queen is sucking all of your energy and blood out of you, and they have income taxes, VAT taxes, the average Brit's paying about 70% in one form of tax or another.
[01:50:59.289 --> 01:51:00.330]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:01.365 --> 01:51:04.367]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.

[01:52:02.527 --> 01:52:08.110]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:08.110 --> 01:52:13.132]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:13.132 --> 01:52:18.155]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:18.695 --> 01:52:23.920]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[01:53:32.248 --> 01:53:36.809]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:53:36.809 --> 01:53:42.630]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.

[01:54:11.004 --> 01:54:13.887]  Paul Joseph Watson's going to be with us five minutes to the next hour.
[01:54:13.887 --> 01:54:15.388]  Then I'm going to blitz through your phone calls.
[01:54:15.388 --> 01:54:23.736]  And at least the last half hour of the next hour will be a complete deluge of key news analysis information.
[01:54:23.736 --> 01:54:30.141]  It's all coming up straight ahead, including the one-child policy being promoted here in the United States.
[01:54:30.141 --> 01:54:32.043]  Oh, cut your carbon footprint.
[01:54:32.043 --> 01:54:34.785]  Don't have any children or only have one.
[01:54:34.785 --> 01:54:36.187]  You don't have the money anyways.
[01:54:36.187 --> 01:54:37.028]  That is the stated
[01:54:37.967 --> 01:54:45.049]  We're going to go to phone calls here in just a moment with Paul Watson, but Paul, any other key points we haven't raised here today?
[01:54:45.049 --> 01:54:53.292]  I mean, I would just add, I shot this video, we posted it, dealing with the Road Warrior level collapse imminent.
[01:54:53.292 --> 01:54:55.433]  Alex Jones says we must take corrective action now.
[01:54:55.433 --> 01:54:57.333]  I'm asking folks to get that video.
[01:54:57.333 --> 01:55:01.935]  It's up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and get it out to everyone so they know who the culprits are.
[01:55:01.935 --> 01:55:05.536]  That is so essential or they'll continue to pose as our saviors and get more power.
[01:55:06.996 --> 01:55:09.477]  There's so many other things going on.
[01:55:09.477 --> 01:55:12.999]  What else is on your radar screen?
[01:55:12.999 --> 01:55:30.326]  No, just to add, I mean, the point at which it all collapses, as any good historian worth his salt will tell you, is where, you know, the Empire's scramble to service its debt outweighs the expenditure on its military adventures.
[01:55:30.326 --> 01:55:33.108]  And America is rapidly approaching that point.
[01:55:34.348 --> 01:55:47.281]  And so, you know, when 20% of your tax money goes towards servicing the federal debt, that's when these austerity measures are really going to start to bite, because they're going to say there's a shortfall, we need to make it up.
[01:55:47.281 --> 01:55:56.730]  And I played a clip of Obama yesterday at the G20 saying, really tough stuff coming next year, big cuts in spending, but that's services, not cuts in taxes.
[01:55:57.958 --> 01:55:58.759]  Exactly.
[01:55:58.759 --> 01:56:01.162]  Exactly the same thing as David Cameron said.
[01:56:01.162 --> 01:56:06.349]  He said it's going to affect every single person in the United States, in the United Kingdom.
[01:56:06.349 --> 01:56:09.794]  And it's going to be years and years of pain.
[01:56:09.794 --> 01:56:13.418]  And, you know, that's when all this tyranny is going to kick in.
[01:56:13.999 --> 01:56:20.224]  But as we know with the comprehensive annual financial reports, they can still afford to maintain all the public services.
[01:56:20.224 --> 01:56:25.909]  This is about sucking the middle class dry and completely collapsing the middle class.
[01:56:25.909 --> 01:56:30.312]  They get you dependent, they run up the debts to them, made up out of nothing, then they implode everything.
[01:56:30.312 --> 01:56:35.036]  And now Cameron has continued the ban on Michael Savage traveling to England.
[01:56:35.036 --> 01:56:38.419]  He bans Brits who've been in trouble at football games from leaving the country.
[01:56:39.059 --> 01:56:42.561]  So they're just setting up this Nazi Germany type scenario.
[01:56:42.561 --> 01:56:44.322]  He's pushing the carbon taxes.
[01:56:44.322 --> 01:56:46.163]  Boy, what a conservative revolution!
[01:56:46.163 --> 01:56:49.825]  Doesn't matter who you put in, these creatures just continue the agenda.
[01:56:51.650 --> 01:56:52.371]  Well, exactly.
[01:56:52.371 --> 01:57:00.658]  I mean, they had this big forum for which laws people in the UK want to repeal, or which ones they wanted added.
[01:57:00.658 --> 01:57:09.786]  And the big thing to come out of it was that people want disabled people, in some cases, and others, to be sterilized.
[01:57:09.786 --> 01:57:12.588]  Yeah, that was the Daily Mail headline.
[01:57:12.588 --> 01:57:14.250]  Poor houses and sterilization.
[01:57:15.325 --> 01:57:22.447]  And there also, there was an article out of Indy today where they're again seriously proposing to sterilize people.
[01:57:22.447 --> 01:57:27.908]  And if people have forgotten from history, sterilization leads to extermination.
[01:57:27.908 --> 01:57:34.250]  350,000 people in Nazi Germany were sterilized and we all know what, you know, happened after that.
[01:57:34.730 --> 01:57:35.350]  Well, that's right.
[01:57:35.350 --> 01:57:42.114]  A lot of people out there who don't believe anything the media says claim that Hitler didn't kill a bunch of Jews, gypsies, Christians and others.
[01:57:42.114 --> 01:57:43.214]  Yes, he did, folks.
[01:57:43.214 --> 01:57:45.836]  I've read Hitler's speeches.
[01:57:45.836 --> 01:57:50.518]  I've read transcripts of his radio addresses of Joseph Goebbels of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute.
[01:57:50.518 --> 01:57:53.280]  And our government and the Rockefellers funded all of that.
[01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:55.481]  And that was the Nuremberg defense the Nazis used.
[01:57:56.101 --> 01:58:02.528]  And all this stuff was created and was the pseudoscience of eugenics in England.
[01:58:02.528 --> 01:58:04.790]  And this is the model that's being pushed.
[01:58:04.790 --> 01:58:08.915]  And yes, the Nazis were monsters and they did carry out eugenics.
[01:58:11.013 --> 01:58:20.836]  Marie Stokes, who founded all the abortion clinics and concentrated them in the poor areas in the UK and the United States, she wrote love letters to Hitler.
[01:58:20.836 --> 01:58:25.478]  She attended the Nazi Congress on Population Control.
[01:58:25.478 --> 01:58:37.282]  You know, this came from Britain, Hitler picked it up, and it led to the mass extermination of millions of people, not just Jews, but undesirables, disabled people, and anyone that, you know, spoke out against the system.
[01:58:37.282 --> 01:58:37.882]  Well said, Watson.
[01:58:37.882 --> 01:58:38.342]  Well said.
[01:58:38.342 --> 01:58:39.083]  We'll be back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:42.776 --> 01:58:45.401]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:50.339 --> 01:58:54.882]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:54.882 --> 01:58:55.802]  Number 1.
[01:58:55.802 --> 01:58:59.225]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:59.225 --> 01:59:00.085]  Number 2.
[01:59:00.085 --> 01:59:04.968]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:04.968 --> 01:59:05.709]  It's true.
[01:59:05.709 --> 01:59:10.592]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:10.592 --> 01:59:11.412]  Number 3.
[01:59:11.412 --> 01:59:14.995]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:14.995 --> 01:59:18.697]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:18.897 --> 01:59:19.697]  Number 4.
[01:59:19.697 --> 01:59:22.458]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:22.458 --> 01:59:26.139]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:26.139 --> 01:59:26.919]  Number 5.
[01:59:26.919 --> 01:59:31.080]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:31.080 --> 01:59:36.122]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:36.122 --> 01:59:40.303]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:40.303 --> 01:59:42.084]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:59:47.927 --> 01:59:49.149]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:10.385]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.385 --> 02:00:11.967]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.967 --> 02:00:13.529]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.529 --> 02:00:17.713]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.713 --> 02:00:21.797]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.818 --> 02:00:27.539]  Hey, what's going on Alex?
[02:00:27.539 --> 02:00:28.961]  I got two comments for you.
[02:00:28.961 --> 02:00:30.783]  I pray for you every night that I pray.
[02:00:30.783 --> 02:00:33.547]  I pray for you, your family, and your staff.
[02:00:33.547 --> 02:00:34.768]  And my other comment is...
[02:00:46.603 --> 02:00:54.046]  I had called about the Machete film and I heard that it was getting edited by you and that made me real glad.
[02:00:54.046 --> 02:00:56.467]  Not edited by me!
[02:00:56.467 --> 02:01:00.948]  Not by you, but... I don't want him to make the film he wants to make.
[02:01:00.948 --> 02:01:05.650]  I have a right to criticize it, but Rodriguez did an interview with Ain't It Cool News and said,
[02:01:07.306 --> 02:01:07.886]  I don't think so.
[02:01:27.955 --> 02:01:34.200]  I'm with Our Change Chicago, I'm part of the group, and we're going to the City Hall on July 28th, and we're going to protest about the water.
[02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:36.842]  You know, so we're going to talk, we're going to take statements, and we're going to talk.
[02:01:36.842 --> 02:01:43.567]  We're going to go about six, seven people, a good group, and we're going to go every month and demand that we don't want no sodium chloride in our water.
[02:01:43.567 --> 02:01:44.187]  Good!
[02:01:44.187 --> 02:01:50.232]  And I want to put a call to all the other We Are Change groups to take them to the same thing and do the same things we're going to do.
[02:01:50.232 --> 02:01:55.256]  We're going to go every single month, every month that they have a public town hall meeting, and we're going to talk about it.
[02:01:55.734 --> 02:02:05.142]  And we're not going to go talking all crazy so they can try to ban us or something, but we're going to go dress nicely, talk professionally, have statements, have facts.
[02:02:05.142 --> 02:02:09.887]  And I was just wondering if you could tell me if there was anywhere I can get some more facts about the sodium chloride in the water.
[02:02:10.868 --> 02:02:16.710]  Well, Watson's written articles we've had the head toxicologist of the EPA on years ago.
[02:02:16.710 --> 02:02:21.212]  They've testified before Congress where they say it's deadly poison, causes brain damage.
[02:02:21.212 --> 02:02:27.054]  The American Dental Association for four years has now told parents not to brush their children's teeth with fluoride.
[02:02:28.115 --> 02:02:33.841]  I mean, you can just... Paul Watson, I mean, they now admit that aspartame is causing miscarriages.
[02:02:33.841 --> 02:02:36.824]  Well, they knew that in the trials back in the 70s.
[02:02:36.824 --> 02:02:38.786]  They know what sodium fluoride does.
[02:02:38.786 --> 02:02:45.634]  I mean, you can just search engine the term fluoride facts, and there's, you know, tons of data sheets out there with key info.
[02:02:45.634 --> 02:02:48.497]  Watson, I mean, what would you say before a council about fluoride?
[02:02:50.575 --> 02:02:56.598]  There's an article I wrote called Scientific Study Finds Fluoride Horror Stories Factual.
[02:02:56.598 --> 02:02:59.440]  That's got a list of the evidence and is sourced.
[02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:06.703]  And there's an excellent book, which I'm reading at the moment, which is called The Fluoride Deception by Christopher Bryson.
[02:03:06.703 --> 02:03:11.486]  And in that book are literally hundreds of studies from Harvard
[02:03:12.266 --> 02:03:23.914]  Boston and other major universities that prove fluoride is a neurotoxin and it causes bone cancer and all the scientific studies are mentioned and discussed at length.
[02:03:23.914 --> 02:03:36.281]  And reduces fertility and calcifies the organs and much of the quote calcium buildup you get in your arteries is the sodium fluoride, congestive heart failure, arterials.
[02:03:36.281 --> 02:03:38.543]  I mean the list just goes on and on ladies and gentlemen.
[02:03:39.853 --> 02:03:40.253]  I don't think so.
[02:04:03.361 --> 02:04:15.624]  Go there with fluoride fact sheets printed out and warn people because not only is sodium fluoride deadly, between 150 and over 300 chemicals depending on what brand they buy, most of it from China, is dumped.
[02:04:15.624 --> 02:04:18.305]  Mercury, lead, arsenic, I mean you can't make this up.
[02:04:19.025 --> 02:04:19.866]  It's so bold.
[02:04:19.866 --> 02:04:21.167]  It's so insane.
[02:04:21.167 --> 02:04:22.167]  It's so in your face.
[02:04:22.167 --> 02:04:25.970]  I mean, it's a fact aspartame is in tens of thousands of foods now.
[02:04:25.970 --> 02:04:27.371]  Tens of thousands.
[02:04:27.371 --> 02:04:31.795]  And they're now calling it new names, like amino sweet and things.
[02:04:31.795 --> 02:04:33.376]  And it just devastates you.
[02:04:33.376 --> 02:04:34.757]  All of this is admitted.
[02:04:34.757 --> 02:04:35.777]  Thank you for the call, Tony.
[02:04:35.777 --> 02:04:36.238]  Keep it up.
[02:04:36.238 --> 02:04:37.699]  Great job.

[02:08:38.517 --> 02:08:41.259]  I just had three quick things to ask you real quick.
[02:08:41.259 --> 02:08:41.999]  Go ahead.
[02:08:41.999 --> 02:08:45.902]  I just wanted to ask you, have you ever heard of Dr. Sebi?
[02:08:45.902 --> 02:08:46.943]  Have you ever heard of B.T.
[02:08:46.943 --> 02:08:47.623]  Cotton?
[02:08:47.623 --> 02:08:51.846]  And how do you think they program these college professors?
[02:08:51.846 --> 02:08:56.349]  Okay, the names you threw out rung some bells.
[02:08:56.349 --> 02:08:57.991]  Sam again?
[02:08:57.991 --> 02:09:05.536]  Dr. Sebi, he claimed to cure AIDS, supposedly defeated in the New York Supreme Court in 1988, claiming that he cured AIDS and defeated him, supposedly.
[02:09:06.701 --> 02:09:10.162]  You know, I don't know enough about that to be able to comment on it.
[02:09:10.162 --> 02:09:16.364]  I know HIV is just an overall cover for soft kill weapon testing going on in the third world.
[02:09:16.364 --> 02:09:19.805]  And we know they developed an autoimmune virus.
[02:09:19.805 --> 02:09:21.225]  There's government documents on that.
[02:09:21.225 --> 02:09:26.307]  They didn't call it AIDS, but that was done in the 70s by the Navy in their weapons labs.
[02:09:26.307 --> 02:09:28.768]  And we've had guests on those subjects.
[02:09:29.488 --> 02:09:33.432]  But specifically, you're saying, how do they program college professors?
[02:09:33.432 --> 02:09:46.824]  Very simply, you can either be a right-winger and buy into the fake right-wing paradigm, kind of the Republican mainline system, and you get tenure and funding and books published and, you know, additional research funds.
[02:09:46.824 --> 02:09:50.487]  So instead of making $50,000 a year as a professor, if you play ball, you can make millions a year.
[02:09:51.688 --> 02:09:56.370]  Uh, or you can be a leftist professor and be given foundation and government funding as well.
[02:09:56.370 --> 02:09:59.952]  So it's the research funding that President Dwight D. Eisenhower talked about.
[02:09:59.952 --> 02:10:02.493]  At that time, close to 90% was government funded.
[02:10:02.493 --> 02:10:09.897]  And then he talked about the dangerous influence of the military-industrial complex by a technological elite or a scientific dictatorship.
[02:10:09.897 --> 02:10:12.518]  So that's how they control the professors.
[02:10:12.518 --> 02:10:15.460]  Oh, wait, because this is disgusting, because I'm a Division I athlete myself.
[02:10:15.460 --> 02:10:19.642]  I'm on full scholarship, which is, it makes it ridiculous when athletes act like they can't be awake, too.
[02:10:20.498 --> 02:10:20.799]  I don't know.
[02:10:35.286 --> 02:10:39.928]  They act like it's a conspiracy theory to make me out to be a nut whenever I ask them anything that's a logical question.
[02:10:39.928 --> 02:10:55.154]  Well, there are memos out that the New York Times reported on last week, but they said it was a good thing that all the main global warming professors over the top colleges in the world are receiving funding and they are told by the UN, do not talk to the media, do not answer questions, because they can't.
[02:10:55.154 --> 02:10:59.756]  Listen, I saw headlines all this week again, the Arctic and Antarctic is melting.
[02:11:00.476 --> 02:11:01.337]  Okay.
[02:11:01.337 --> 02:11:06.304]  Well, you know, in the Arctic, it is summer right now.
[02:11:06.304 --> 02:11:08.146]  It's winter in the Antarctic.
[02:11:08.146 --> 02:11:12.632]  And so when it's summer, the ice sheet always gets smaller, and then it gets bigger in the winter.
[02:11:12.632 --> 02:11:15.315]  It expands and contracts, but they will show the glaciers melting.
[02:11:15.876 --> 02:11:18.578]  And say we're all dead and the sea levels are gonna come up.
[02:11:18.578 --> 02:11:22.460]  Meanwhile, Al Gore's out buying $15 million houses right on the beach.
[02:11:22.460 --> 02:11:42.134]  I mean, even if you believe carbon dioxide's deadly, how does cutting our carbon dioxide that humans exhale and putting taxes on Europe and the West, and then no taxes on China, India, Mexico, and other third world nations, when then our industry moves there, then the carbon dioxide input actually goes up,
[02:11:43.049 --> 02:11:46.592]  You, say that to the professor.
[02:11:46.592 --> 02:11:48.413]  I know, I tell him all the facts.
[02:11:48.413 --> 02:11:49.955]  I tell him about Climategate.
[02:11:49.955 --> 02:11:51.256]  I bring it all up to him.
[02:11:51.256 --> 02:11:52.176]  It's really disgusting.
[02:11:52.176 --> 02:11:54.718]  I mean, I tell him, you know, I tell him everything.
[02:11:54.718 --> 02:11:56.420]  They want to act like I'm a nut.
[02:11:56.420 --> 02:11:57.120]  It's ridiculous.
[02:11:57.120 --> 02:11:59.402]  I mean... Well, look, look, look, sir.
[02:11:59.402 --> 02:12:05.607]  Congressman Stark, two weeks ago, said in a town hall, there is no problem on the border.
[02:12:05.607 --> 02:12:10.211]  Two days ago, Senator Harry Reid, in a video interview, we've got the clip,
[02:12:10.751 --> 02:12:12.672]  But it's up on InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[02:12:12.672 --> 02:12:13.312]  People want to see it.
[02:12:13.312 --> 02:12:14.593]  Maybe we'll have time to play it.
[02:12:14.593 --> 02:12:15.973]  It's a short clip.
[02:12:15.973 --> 02:12:19.475]  And they said, we have a big problem with illegal aliens in construction.
[02:12:19.475 --> 02:12:25.237]  This research study shows that 70 percent of construction workers are illegal aliens.
[02:12:25.237 --> 02:12:26.078]  He says, that's not true.
[02:12:26.078 --> 02:12:27.598]  There are none in Arizona.
[02:12:27.598 --> 02:12:29.059]  There are none in Nevada.
[02:12:29.059 --> 02:12:32.861]  And it turns out in Nevada, they have double that number.
[02:12:32.861 --> 02:12:34.722]  So, I mean, they just lie to you.
[02:12:34.722 --> 02:12:35.082]  I mean, if you
[02:12:36.082 --> 02:12:38.083]  Say anything to them, they'll lie to you.
[02:12:38.083 --> 02:12:41.625]  I mean, I've seen them lie and say that Margaret Sanger wasn't a Nazi.
[02:12:41.625 --> 02:12:42.846]  I mean, this is just what they do.
[02:12:42.846 --> 02:12:49.230]  They have no respect for you, they stonewall you, because they know it's their eugenics religion.
[02:12:49.230 --> 02:12:51.932]  It's their excuse to collectivize things.
[02:12:51.932 --> 02:13:01.758]  So if I was you, I'd just get your degree, get your scholarship, play ball, and move on, because it sounds like, you know, you're getting a good deal out of it, and you know the truth.
[02:13:02.458 --> 02:13:07.286]  And so I would just hand out flyers, wake up the students to the brainwashing.
[02:13:07.286 --> 02:13:11.572]  But you're probably wasting your time with these arrogant people.
[02:13:11.572 --> 02:13:14.336]  They are running a cult, a eugenics cult.
[02:13:14.336 --> 02:13:15.878]  We're going to cover that coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[02:13:15.878 --> 02:13:16.539]  Anything else, Taylor?
[02:13:17.372 --> 02:13:23.157]  Oh yeah, I was going to say BT cotton and how like it's in women's tampons and diapers and other things like that and how that's just disgusting.
[02:13:23.157 --> 02:13:24.919]  I mean hybrid plants in general.
[02:13:24.919 --> 02:13:31.145]  People need to really research hybrid plants and what they're doing with the genetic modification with the cotton, like how 88% of the U.S.
[02:13:31.145 --> 02:13:33.387]  cotton... I'm a plant and soil science major, so like...
[02:13:33.767 --> 02:13:34.188]  I think so.
[02:13:48.604 --> 02:13:49.905]  Taylor, write an article about it.
[02:13:49.905 --> 02:13:50.865]  You want to write an article.
[02:13:50.865 --> 02:13:52.866]  If you want to use a pseudonym, that's fine.
[02:13:52.866 --> 02:13:57.528]  As a student studying this technology, send it to writersandinfowars.com.
[02:13:57.528 --> 02:13:58.448]  We'll check out the facts.
[02:13:58.448 --> 02:13:59.568]  If it's good, we'll post it.
[02:13:59.568 --> 02:14:00.349]  God bless you.
[02:14:00.349 --> 02:14:01.309]  That's how you fight back.
[02:14:01.309 --> 02:14:02.629]  Start your own blog.
[02:14:02.629 --> 02:14:04.370]  Create your own system.
[02:14:04.370 --> 02:14:10.853]  You're an agent of liberty inside that brainwashing facility, and so be subversive against their subversion of truth.
[02:14:12.367 --> 02:14:14.608]  Let's just search engine it right now.
[02:14:14.608 --> 02:14:19.330]  Farm animals dying, animals fed BT cotton die.
[02:14:19.330 --> 02:14:35.838]  Because what they do is they feed the seeds that are stripped out in the machines, when they take the seeds out of the cotton that's been grown, that's grown from BT, they can soak the Roundup Ready on the corn, on the cotton, on the soybeans, the plants don't die, they absorb it.
[02:14:35.838 --> 02:14:39.160]  And I mean, I just had Mr. Smith on,
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:52.106]  A few weeks ago, Jeffrey Smith about all the mainline studies that they feed BT cotton seeds to cows, they feed it to pigs, they feed it to other farm animals, and they get sick and die.
[02:14:52.106 --> 02:14:55.387]  And that's 100% in India and the United States.
[02:14:55.387 --> 02:14:56.067]  100% fact.
[02:14:56.067 --> 02:14:57.028]  They know it's 100% fact.
[02:14:57.028 --> 02:14:59.589]  In fact, search engine it right now for people.
[02:14:59.589 --> 02:15:00.850]  Let's just show them.
[02:15:00.850 --> 02:15:03.371]  Farm animals fed BT cotton seeds, sick and dying.
[02:15:04.411 --> 02:15:05.752]  I mean, they know.
[02:15:05.752 --> 02:15:06.192]  They know.
[02:15:06.192 --> 02:15:08.814]  I mean, they got German studies about the BT pollen.
[02:15:08.814 --> 02:15:13.817]  Other bugs won't eat it, but the bees do.
[02:15:13.817 --> 02:15:14.738]  And they die.
[02:15:14.738 --> 02:15:16.659]  And they find it in their intestines.
[02:15:16.659 --> 02:15:19.641]  Sickness and death in animals exposed to BT cotton.
[02:15:19.641 --> 02:15:23.123]  GMWatch.org.
[02:15:23.123 --> 02:15:24.303]  Academic Review.
[02:15:24.303 --> 02:15:26.465]  Genetic Roulette Claim.
[02:15:26.465 --> 02:15:29.647]  Sheep die after grazing in BT cotton.
[02:15:29.647 --> 02:15:31.428]  I mean, there's a whole bunch of articles right there.
[02:15:32.148 --> 02:15:34.010]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[02:15:34.010 --> 02:15:34.410]  B.T.
[02:15:34.410 --> 02:15:38.314]  Cotton is killing animals in India and affecting humans.
[02:15:38.314 --> 02:15:38.954]  It goes on.
[02:15:38.954 --> 02:15:39.254]  B.T.
[02:15:39.254 --> 02:15:42.858]  Cotton killing animals in North India on a large scale.
[02:15:42.858 --> 02:15:44.919]  He just keeps scrolling down through them.
[02:15:44.919 --> 02:15:47.181]  There's the Hindustan Times.
[02:15:47.181 --> 02:15:47.602]  B.T.
[02:15:47.602 --> 02:15:49.784]  Cotton fields can kill farm animals.
[02:15:49.784 --> 02:15:50.785]  Hindustan Times.
[02:15:50.785 --> 02:15:52.146]  That's a mainstream paper.
[02:15:52.146 --> 02:15:53.027]  Just keep reading headlines.
[02:15:53.027 --> 02:15:53.907]  Keep scrolling.
[02:15:53.907 --> 02:15:56.490]  Sure, there's tens of thousands you can read for yourself.
[02:15:56.490 --> 02:15:58.912]  That's what, I mean, it hit me this morning when I was driving into work.
[02:16:01.328 --> 02:16:06.271]  Because I'm saying to myself, man, you're giving up opportunities to have a reality show.
[02:16:06.271 --> 02:16:10.654]  And maybe if you do that, then it'll get your name out there more and people will get your real info.
[02:16:10.654 --> 02:16:12.555]  Or you're not gonna go do this History Channel show.
[02:16:12.555 --> 02:16:15.497]  You're saying no to all this stuff.
[02:16:15.497 --> 02:16:18.238]  And what about your career and all this?
[02:16:18.238 --> 02:16:20.279]  I could care less.
[02:16:20.279 --> 02:16:25.262]  And then I just thought to myself, I mean, this is such a nightmare.
[02:16:25.262 --> 02:16:28.504]  I know Aspartame is in tens of thousands of products.
[02:16:28.504 --> 02:16:29.025]  Foods.
[02:16:30.630 --> 02:16:36.556]  Cake mixes, candy, gum, even the regular sugar stuff hasn't added.
[02:16:36.556 --> 02:16:42.421]  I know that the government knew when they approved it that it killed the majority of the monkeys they fed it to.
[02:16:42.421 --> 02:16:45.284]  I mean, it kills you!
[02:16:45.284 --> 02:16:48.907]  I know BT cotton is killing the animals that eat it.
[02:16:48.907 --> 02:16:52.290]  I know the BT corn is killing the bees.
[02:16:52.290 --> 02:16:52.811]  Well, the U.S.
[02:16:52.811 --> 02:16:53.852]  has lost more than half of them.
[02:16:54.762 --> 02:16:58.865]  I know that sodium fluoride brain damages us.
[02:16:58.865 --> 02:17:07.291]  I know the genetically modified salmon are designed to take over and cause extinction in the normal salmon populations and the government knows that and it's mainstream news.
[02:17:07.291 --> 02:17:09.793]  McClatchy newspapers two days ago.
[02:17:09.793 --> 02:17:12.855]  I know I'm telling the truth.
[02:17:12.855 --> 02:17:17.058]  I know there's a giant eugenics operation and we're arguing about
[02:17:18.860 --> 02:17:21.001]  Is it racist to be against government-run health care?
[02:17:21.001 --> 02:17:28.523]  The government-run health care is meant to take control of your life and carry out eugenics and have government-run systems of diagnosis.
[02:17:28.523 --> 02:17:31.784]  I know that all of this is being done.
[02:17:31.784 --> 02:17:33.485]  It's a hundred percent.
[02:17:33.485 --> 02:17:38.567]  How can I even hate some dumb cop who comes over and threatens me and violates my rights?
[02:17:38.567 --> 02:17:40.547]  Sure, five, six years ago I get angry and hate them.
[02:17:40.547 --> 02:17:44.769]  Now I just see some poor poisoned zombie who I cry at night wishing I could reach him.
[02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:48.921]  I mean, these stupid politicians, they don't know.
[02:17:48.921 --> 02:17:51.022]  It's the scientific elite.
[02:17:51.022 --> 02:18:00.507]  I'm making a film about this right now, and I know all the info, but I'm so immersed in it, and I'm learning so much, it's just, it's unspeakable.
[02:18:00.507 --> 02:18:08.331]  It's all around us, and they're announcing every day, in fact, search engine, infertility at epidemic levels worldwide.
[02:18:08.331 --> 02:18:09.811]  Search that term.
[02:18:09.811 --> 02:18:14.714]  I mean, there are countries where the majority of men are almost completely infertile.
[02:18:17.349 --> 02:18:19.934]  There are... It's happening.
[02:18:19.934 --> 02:18:21.496]  The women are becoming infertile.
[02:18:21.496 --> 02:18:23.220]  You are being sterilized.
[02:18:23.220 --> 02:18:24.782]  You are being given cancer.
[02:18:24.782 --> 02:18:25.804]  You are being murdered.
[02:18:25.804 --> 02:18:26.385]  It is 100% fact.
[02:18:30.468 --> 02:18:34.891]  99.9% of us are not on the winning end of this.
[02:18:34.891 --> 02:18:43.358]  Even if you're a psychopath and love killing people with... That's how the scientists do it, with covert, soft, degenerative kill systems that take time.
[02:18:43.358 --> 02:18:44.478]  They love it.
[02:18:44.478 --> 02:18:46.680]  This is how these cowardly creeps do it.
[02:18:46.680 --> 02:18:49.082]  And they laugh and think you're too stupid to be aware of it.
[02:18:49.082 --> 02:18:51.344]  They write textbooks on how they're doing it.
[02:18:51.344 --> 02:18:52.265]  We've quoted them here.
[02:18:52.265 --> 02:18:53.425]  We've written countless articles.
[02:18:53.425 --> 02:18:54.286]  I've made films.
[02:18:54.286 --> 02:18:57.549]  I said I'd take your calls.
[02:18:57.549 --> 02:18:57.869]  It's just...
[02:19:00.765 --> 02:19:04.947]  If you're an FBI agent watching, please research the GMO.
[02:19:04.947 --> 02:19:21.676]  I mean, if you're a government person, if you're a corporate minion, when you get home tonight to your wife in your big mansion, and you know this stuff's going on, and you are too lazy to even stop your children from eating it and being part of it, why?
[02:19:21.676 --> 02:19:23.817]  Why do you care about the Yankees owner dying?
[02:19:24.830 --> 02:19:28.031]  Why do you care about your hairline receding?
[02:19:28.031 --> 02:19:30.952]  Why do women care if they're a few pounds overweight?
[02:19:30.952 --> 02:19:32.253]  Why are you so decadent?
[02:19:32.253 --> 02:19:33.373]  Why are you so shallow?
[02:19:33.373 --> 02:19:38.315]  You're being murdered and these people think you're so stupid they're gonna get away with it.
[02:19:38.315 --> 02:19:41.536]  And why do you think I've got all this courage and I'm so great for warning people?
[02:19:42.378 --> 02:19:43.359]  I don't have any courage.
[02:19:43.359 --> 02:19:44.500]  Folks, this is survival.
[02:19:44.500 --> 02:19:47.502]  This is what a man would do when faced with this.
[02:19:47.502 --> 02:19:49.503]  What else could I do?
[02:19:49.503 --> 02:19:51.444]  What other response to this is there?
[02:19:51.444 --> 02:19:53.706]  We're all in this together.
[02:19:53.706 --> 02:19:57.789]  Whether you think you serve the system or not, you are in the crosshairs.
[02:19:57.789 --> 02:19:58.949]  You're under attack.
[02:19:58.949 --> 02:20:00.490]  This is real.
[02:20:00.490 --> 02:20:00.891]  Face it!
[02:20:01.351 --> 02:20:02.653]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:20:02.653 --> 02:20:08.239]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:20:08.239 --> 02:20:13.265]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:20:13.265 --> 02:20:18.291]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:20:18.832 --> 02:20:24.057]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:20:24.057 --> 02:20:31.164]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:20:31.164 --> 02:20:32.285]  And here's the best part.
[02:20:32.285 --> 02:20:38.631]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:20:38.971 --> 02:20:42.152]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:20:42.152 --> 02:20:44.373]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:20:44.373 --> 02:20:45.313]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:20:45.313 --> 02:20:45.513]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:20:45.513 --> 02:20:48.954]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:20:48.954 --> 02:20:50.694]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:21:05.558 --> 02:21:06.839]  Tyranny is here.
[02:21:06.839 --> 02:21:10.540]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:21:10.540 --> 02:21:12.981]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:21:12.981 --> 02:21:18.863]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:21:18.863 --> 02:21:25.105]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:21:25.525 --> 02:21:31.507]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:21:31.507 --> 02:21:35.689]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:21:35.689 --> 02:21:39.970]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:21:39.970 --> 02:21:45.913]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:21:45.913 --> 02:21:49.474]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:21:49.474 --> 02:21:51.455]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:21:51.455 --> 02:21:51.875]  It's here.

[02:22:01.238 --> 02:22:02.258]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:22:02.258 --> 02:22:07.800]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:22:07.800 --> 02:22:08.320]  I get it.
[02:22:08.320 --> 02:22:17.943]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:22:17.943 --> 02:22:19.123]  That's not what's happening.
[02:22:19.363 --> 02:22:27.830]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:22:27.830 --> 02:22:31.213]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:22:31.213 --> 02:22:35.496]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:22:35.496 --> 02:22:37.098]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:22:37.098 --> 02:22:40.500]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[02:22:40.500 --> 02:22:44.664]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:22:44.864 --> 02:22:45.765]  You should too.
[02:22:45.765 --> 02:22:46.906]  Find out what they know.
[02:22:46.906 --> 02:22:50.208]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.

[02:22:50.628 --> 02:22:50.809]  That's 800-686-2237.

[02:23:51.743 --> 02:23:52.563]  News Blitz coming up.
[02:23:52.563 --> 02:23:53.384]  Let's go to your calls.
[02:23:53.384 --> 02:23:53.944]  Tim in Michigan.
[02:23:53.944 --> 02:23:54.724]  You're on the air.
[02:23:54.724 --> 02:23:54.964]  Hey Tim.
[02:24:15.660 --> 02:24:18.142]  Good, your audio is really low, Tim.
[02:24:18.142 --> 02:24:20.783]  Okay, I'll talk right into my phone.
[02:24:20.783 --> 02:24:22.024]  I'm wearing headphones.
[02:24:22.024 --> 02:24:23.065]  I gotta let you go, Tim.
[02:24:23.065 --> 02:24:23.745]  Can't hear you.
[02:24:23.745 --> 02:24:27.288]  Alex in Alaska, you're on the air.
[02:24:27.288 --> 02:24:27.868]  Hello?
[02:24:27.868 --> 02:24:29.169]  Yes, sir.
[02:24:29.169 --> 02:24:29.989]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:24:29.989 --> 02:24:30.210]  Good.
[02:24:30.210 --> 02:24:44.199]  A minute ago, you kind of took the words right out of my mouth about everything, because, yeah, I mean, we all have some limit of courage, but it takes a real man to be able to do what you're doing.
[02:24:44.918 --> 02:24:51.043]  Two months ago, when I started listening to your show, I said, I need to start a blog about this.
[02:24:51.043 --> 02:24:52.364]  And then I started a blog.
[02:24:52.364 --> 02:24:56.207]  And then the next day I said, no, I need a radio blog.
[02:24:56.207 --> 02:24:58.729]  So I started a radio blog.
[02:24:58.729 --> 02:25:01.592]  And, you know, it's hard.
[02:25:01.592 --> 02:25:02.713]  It's hard to do this.
[02:25:02.713 --> 02:25:04.414]  I don't know how you do it every day.
[02:25:04.414 --> 02:25:08.057]  It's hard to think about everything that's going on.
[02:25:08.057 --> 02:25:11.240]  And why in the hell don't more people know?
[02:25:12.435 --> 02:25:19.359]  Well, they're turning our entire environment into a toxic witch's brew for control.
[02:25:19.359 --> 02:25:22.261]  And they're taking all of our food supplies and adulterating them.
[02:25:22.261 --> 02:25:26.043]  They're genetically engineering the entire biosphere.
[02:25:26.043 --> 02:25:29.465]  All of it by design to sterilize and poison us.
[02:25:29.465 --> 02:25:31.046]  I mean, this is real.
[02:25:31.046 --> 02:25:33.487]  And really, everything else is secondary.
[02:25:33.487 --> 02:25:35.148]  And they're bringing down our financial system.
[02:25:35.148 --> 02:25:37.309]  They're assaulting our farms and ranches.
[02:25:37.309 --> 02:25:40.511]  Everything they're doing is to gain total control.
[02:25:41.784 --> 02:26:07.044]  Yeah, and you know, I was in the Army, never deployed, but I know I was under that brainwashing system, you know, that, uh, yeah, the government's good, the government's good, and for years, I'm 23 now, but until I really opened my eyes and started seeing the big picture, for like 22 years, I know what I was taught to know, okay?
[02:26:07.044 --> 02:26:08.625]  Through the media, the mainstream media,
[02:26:09.737 --> 02:26:13.260]  And, you know, it's mind-boggling.
[02:26:13.260 --> 02:26:17.224]  Well, you've started your journey into a wider world, and it's good to hear from you, Alex.
[02:26:17.224 --> 02:26:18.164]  Keep it up.
[02:26:18.164 --> 02:26:19.606]  Let's talk to Jeff in Michigan.
[02:26:19.606 --> 02:26:20.486]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[02:26:20.486 --> 02:26:21.627]  Hey, Alex.
[02:26:21.627 --> 02:26:22.988]  This is Jeff in Michigan.
[02:26:22.988 --> 02:26:25.290]  Hey, buddy.
[02:26:25.290 --> 02:26:33.037]  I turned on the show today, and I hear some joker misrepresenting my Karl Rove confrontation, and I called to set the record straight.
[02:26:34.187 --> 02:26:42.371]  Okay, well you heard me say that, for those that just joined us, that some big guy was yelling and screaming and cussing at Karl Rove, and I said it might have just been somebody who was angry.
[02:26:42.371 --> 02:26:43.892]  But go ahead.
[02:26:43.892 --> 02:26:48.214]  Oh yeah, I'm very angry at these New World Order scum, and I'm a member of We Are Change.
[02:26:48.214 --> 02:26:50.595]  You can see for yourself the video on YouTube.
[02:26:50.595 --> 02:26:55.718]  It's We Are Change Detroit visits a Karl Rove book signing.
[02:26:55.718 --> 02:26:59.400]  And there's edited versions up there and non-edited versions up there.
[02:27:00.385 --> 02:27:04.128]  And he wants to, you know, complain about the foul language.
[02:27:04.128 --> 02:27:08.531]  You watch the video and you see the foul language starts with the manager of the store.
[02:27:08.531 --> 02:27:17.677]  I called Karl Rove a bastard and he... I said, arrest the bastard, he's New World Order scum, Builder Burger scum.
[02:27:17.677 --> 02:27:21.199]  So, um... Well, I say good job, Jeff!
[02:27:21.199 --> 02:27:22.520]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[02:27:22.520 --> 02:27:25.142]  It's... You're my greatest inspiration, you and Luke.
[02:27:25.962 --> 02:27:33.804]  And, uh, it was not often that, um, monsters of his caliber come to my area, and I just could not resist confronting them.
[02:27:33.804 --> 02:27:34.764]  Well, I'll say this.
[02:27:34.764 --> 02:27:46.107]  I mean, nobody's perfect when they confront somebody, and the act of taking action and confronting these people, you know, you got guts, and guts is enough, and we appreciate you standing up to them.
[02:27:46.107 --> 02:27:47.908]  That's a different thing if they started cussing at you.
[02:27:49.747 --> 02:27:57.390]  Yeah, they started cussing at me on my way out as I'm being ushered out by the manager, simply for having the camera.
[02:27:57.390 --> 02:28:05.534]  And I knew I was getting taken out, so I said, you know, the heck with it, I'm just going to start shouting at this guy and let these people know who they're getting an autograph from.
[02:28:05.534 --> 02:28:11.256]  What do you think of the old ladies saying, arrest Alex Jones when they drug you out?
[02:28:11.256 --> 02:28:12.517]  I saw nothing of that.
[02:28:12.517 --> 02:28:19.000]  I saw people coming up to me asking what's going on and thanking me for the things I said and shaking my hand and wondering when they're going to see the video.
[02:28:20.011 --> 02:28:21.091]  Well, that's exciting!
[02:28:21.091 --> 02:28:25.552]  So folks can just search the term, Carl Rove Confronted in Michigan?
[02:28:25.552 --> 02:28:27.133]  We are Change Detroit.
[02:28:27.133 --> 02:28:29.173]  Visit the Carl Rove book signing.
[02:28:29.173 --> 02:28:31.734]  Okay, well, appreciate your call, Jeff.
[02:28:31.734 --> 02:28:35.335]  Adam in California, you're on the air.
[02:28:35.335 --> 02:28:39.156]  Yeah, Dr. Jones, this is an urgent message for California.
[02:28:39.156 --> 02:28:45.917]  We need everyone to register, vote, and promote Proposition 19, the legalization of cannabis.
[02:28:45.917 --> 02:28:47.458]  It's our only lifeline to
[02:28:49.520 --> 02:28:56.549]  Get an industry for California, legalization that lowers drug use, and it made Canada the number one economy in the world.
[02:28:56.549 --> 02:29:00.975]  Well, it doesn't let the government launder the money anymore, so I'm all for it.
[02:29:00.975 --> 02:29:05.662]  Thanks, I'd love for you to promote it, and we really need your help out here, and California needs a lifeline, and we need an industry.
[02:29:06.306 --> 02:29:08.247]  We need all you people to get up and promote it.
[02:29:08.247 --> 02:29:13.570]  Well, I mean, I consulted on it in the film, How Weed Won the West, available at InfoWars.com.
[02:29:13.570 --> 02:29:16.631]  In fact, we have a deal where it's free when you get it with one of my other films.
[02:29:16.631 --> 02:29:20.393]  So, you know, I've done as much as I can here.
[02:29:20.393 --> 02:29:20.933]  Yeah, no, I know.
[02:29:20.933 --> 02:29:21.754]  You're doing everything you can.
[02:29:21.754 --> 02:29:24.895]  That's why I'm here to just try to put the voice out.
[02:29:24.895 --> 02:29:32.319]  NAACP has endorsed this because unfair prosecution of minorities and blacks will generate billions for California.
[02:29:32.927 --> 02:29:36.730]  We'll strengthen our economy against globalist economic dominance.
[02:29:36.730 --> 02:29:38.732]  So put boots to the ground, you guys.
[02:29:38.732 --> 02:29:39.553]  Put flyers up.
[02:29:39.553 --> 02:29:40.894]  Start talking to people.
[02:29:40.894 --> 02:29:41.475]  All right, buddy.
[02:29:41.475 --> 02:29:42.576]  Hey, I hear you.
[02:29:42.576 --> 02:29:43.757]  We're out of time.
[02:29:43.757 --> 02:29:45.979]  Big news blitz coming up on the other side of this break.
[02:29:45.979 --> 02:29:49.162]  And when we have time after that, we'll get to Jim, Bob, and others.
[02:29:49.162 --> 02:29:51.424]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.424 --> 02:29:52.825]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.825 --> 02:29:55.347]  The empire's on the run.

[02:31:00.282 --> 02:31:04.845]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:04.845 --> 02:31:05.766]  Number 1.
[02:31:05.766 --> 02:31:09.189]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.189 --> 02:31:10.049]  Number 2.
[02:31:10.049 --> 02:31:14.933]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:14.933 --> 02:31:15.673]  It's true.
[02:31:15.673 --> 02:31:20.557]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:20.557 --> 02:31:21.378]  Number 3.
[02:31:21.378 --> 02:31:24.960]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:24.960 --> 02:31:28.663]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:28.863 --> 02:31:29.664]  Number 4.
[02:31:29.664 --> 02:31:32.426]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.426 --> 02:31:36.109]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.109 --> 02:31:36.890]  Number 5.
[02:31:36.890 --> 02:31:41.034]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.034 --> 02:31:45.798]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:46.078 --> 02:31:50.263]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:50.263 --> 02:31:52.045]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:32:00.219 --> 02:32:04.421]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:32:04.421 --> 02:32:10.825]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:32:10.825 --> 02:32:18.209]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:32:18.209 --> 02:32:22.752]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[02:32:23.072 --> 02:32:31.740]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[02:32:31.740 --> 02:32:36.003]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[02:32:36.003 --> 02:32:42.209]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:32:42.769 --> 02:32:46.652]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:32:46.652 --> 02:32:54.097]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[02:32:54.097 --> 02:32:54.537]  Thank you!
[02:33:12.971 --> 02:33:18.793]  Okay, I'm going to go through a lot of news.
[02:33:18.793 --> 02:33:32.198]  First, I want to point out that I don't subscribe to Time Magazine Newsweek, but when I'm in Whole Foods, when I'm in HEB grocery stores, or when I'm at a dental office or my parents' house, I see mainstream magazines laying everywhere.
[02:33:33.238 --> 02:33:40.603]  And whether it is magazines like National Geographic or Time, it's the case for killing granny.
[02:33:40.603 --> 02:33:42.625]  Euthanasia is good.
[02:33:42.625 --> 02:33:44.466]  Death panels are good.
[02:33:44.466 --> 02:33:46.327]  Suicide is good.
[02:33:46.327 --> 02:33:48.469]  One-child policy is good.
[02:33:48.469 --> 02:33:56.895]  New York Times, The Final Generation a few weeks ago, written by Peter Singer, the eugenicist, about how we shouldn't be allowed to have any children.
[02:33:56.895 --> 02:34:00.858]  Fox News, you know, having more children is bad for the planet.
[02:34:00.858 --> 02:34:02.259]  Should we put taxes on it?
[02:34:03.544 --> 02:34:07.385]  This is their religion, that humans are bad, that the elite have got to get rid of us.
[02:34:07.385 --> 02:34:16.927]  As the Club of Rome said, they would use a fake environmental movement to shut off resources to the world population to where you're too poor to be able to have children.
[02:34:16.927 --> 02:34:21.148]  And then if you are poor and have children, they're going to come and say you're neglecting them and take them.
[02:34:21.148 --> 02:34:25.069]  Well, here is Time Magazine, the only child myth.
[02:34:25.069 --> 02:34:30.871]  This is the current July 19th issue, this week's issue, and it says,
[02:34:32.111 --> 02:34:34.973]  They're supposed to be selfish, spoiled and lonely.
[02:34:34.973 --> 02:34:37.275]  In fact, they're just fine on the rise.
[02:34:37.275 --> 02:34:40.678]  So I saw this and I knew it would glorify having an only child.
[02:34:40.678 --> 02:34:41.479]  Not that that's bad.
[02:34:41.479 --> 02:34:44.401]  I was an only child till my sister came along when I was 14.
[02:34:44.401 --> 02:34:47.804]  So that's basically like being an only child.
[02:34:47.804 --> 02:34:52.328]  But I knew it would spin it like this is the avant-garde, cool, trendy thing to do.
[02:34:54.369 --> 02:34:58.892]  And remember, this targets mainly middle-class people, and that's who's not having children.
[02:34:58.892 --> 02:35:00.773]  The entire West is dying.
[02:35:00.773 --> 02:35:05.695]  1.3 percent replacement rate for every two parents, 1.3 children on average.
[02:35:05.695 --> 02:35:14.580]  And I knew before I opened it, because it's always the same propaganda, they would say the economy's bad, it's bad for the carbon output of the earth.
[02:35:14.580 --> 02:35:15.161]  We need to
[02:35:18.069 --> 02:35:19.331]  Have a one-child policy.
[02:35:19.331 --> 02:35:20.632]  And you open it up.
[02:35:20.632 --> 02:35:24.137]  Give me a document cam shot on this, boys, for presentplanet.tv viewers.
[02:35:24.137 --> 02:35:28.562]  You open this up, and sure enough, there it is.
[02:35:29.711 --> 02:35:30.852]  One and done.
[02:35:30.852 --> 02:35:35.134]  The economy is sluggish, expenses are up, and raising kids cost a bundle.
[02:35:35.134 --> 02:35:40.256]  What better time to abandon the stereotypes and embrace the possibilities of the only child?
[02:35:40.256 --> 02:35:44.899]  And then it's basically a eugenics article about how great it is.
[02:35:44.899 --> 02:35:46.520]  And my wife, we have three children.
[02:35:46.520 --> 02:35:51.622]  She's had people actually say to her that it's bad to have three children in the grocery store.
[02:35:51.622 --> 02:35:52.823]  These are the eugenicists.
[02:35:54.207 --> 02:36:00.563]  And so this is how they are pushing the wonderful trendiness of all of this.
[02:36:02.128 --> 02:36:08.252]  And then they have a community task force that are harassing people who have too much stuff in their house.
[02:36:08.252 --> 02:36:12.035]  So CPS for adults, elder care.
[02:36:12.035 --> 02:36:15.157]  Again, eugenics was established in the 1860s in England.
[02:36:15.157 --> 02:36:22.082]  They created social workers for racial hygiene to basically assault the poor.
[02:36:22.082 --> 02:36:23.963]  So that's what's going on there.
[02:36:25.544 --> 02:36:26.285]  Economy implodes.
[02:36:26.285 --> 02:36:33.414]  They're going to blame everything on poor people and on families, not on the bankers that did this, who were eugenicists to a man at the top.
[02:36:33.414 --> 02:36:33.935]  Here's another one.
[02:36:33.935 --> 02:36:37.980]  Population control advocate wanted to sterilize food and water to sterilize people.
[02:36:37.980 --> 02:36:40.022]  Mark Moreno, Climate Depot.
[02:36:40.022 --> 02:36:42.886]  Talking about Paul Ehrlich, George Bush's advisor.
[02:36:44.380 --> 02:36:45.101]  That's just today.
[02:36:45.101 --> 02:36:46.002]  This is without looking.
[02:36:56.357 --> 02:36:56.517]  I think?
[02:37:18.570 --> 02:37:20.671]  You name it, it's all there.
[02:37:20.671 --> 02:37:21.352]  Continuing.
[02:37:21.352 --> 02:37:26.935]  So you're eating this and having miscarriage, miscarriage, miscarriage, reduced fertility.
[02:37:26.935 --> 02:37:30.877]  Sterilize the poor and bring back the workhouse.
[02:37:30.877 --> 02:37:34.019]  That's a male online story.
[02:37:34.019 --> 02:37:35.199]  Here's the Wall Street Journal.
[02:37:35.199 --> 02:37:37.901]  Would recession be good for the environment?
[02:37:37.901 --> 02:37:39.822]  Lowering our carbon footprint.
[02:37:39.822 --> 02:37:41.203]  It's a good thing.
[02:37:41.203 --> 02:37:41.823]  Here's another one.
[02:37:41.823 --> 02:37:43.344]  Planet Save.
[02:37:43.344 --> 02:37:44.725]  Another article about that.
[02:37:45.942 --> 02:37:48.245]  Articles all over about the population exploding.
[02:37:48.245 --> 02:37:50.088]  The UN says we've got to reduce it.
[02:37:50.088 --> 02:37:53.373]  Bill Gates says it.
[02:37:53.373 --> 02:37:57.499]  Cap and Trade Bill will be part of Senate Climate Change Bill.
[02:37:57.499 --> 02:38:01.624]  So they're now announcing that they're going to go ahead and try to pass the Cap and Trade.
[02:38:03.763 --> 02:38:08.047]  Polar bear populations exploding despite lies of the media.
[02:38:08.047 --> 02:38:09.468]  Evening Standard.
[02:38:09.468 --> 02:38:22.901]  Prince Charles says that he's launched a stinging attack on climate skeptics, deriding them for peddling pseudo-science when they've been caught engaged in mass fraud.
[02:38:22.901 --> 02:38:25.784]  So that is in the eugenics stack today.
[02:38:28.578 --> 02:38:34.040]  They admit that Avandian is causing heart attacks, but the government says it's going to stay on the market.
[02:38:34.040 --> 02:38:39.543]  Another article, no shot, no school for Alabama sixth graders as the school year gets ready to begin in a month.
[02:38:39.543 --> 02:38:43.745]  But similar articles run everywhere telling you it's the law, you've got to take shots.
[02:38:43.745 --> 02:38:48.887]  No, it's policy that you've got to take the shots, and by law they've got to give you a waiver form.
[02:38:48.887 --> 02:38:51.428]  But a waiver to a law that does not exist.
[02:38:51.428 --> 02:38:54.530]  Mobile phones causing memory loss, brain damage.
[02:38:54.530 --> 02:38:57.191]  Everything they deploy is meant to soft kill you.
[02:38:59.124 --> 02:39:00.925]  People say, well, then why do you promote an iPhone app?
[02:39:00.925 --> 02:39:05.469]  Well, if we can reach people through cell phones and through the devices frying their brains, why not?
[02:39:05.469 --> 02:39:07.290]  I mean, what, I'm not supposed to go into the Matrix?
[02:39:07.290 --> 02:39:11.173]  I'm not supposed to jack into the Matrix and, you know, go in there and get people out of it?
[02:39:11.173 --> 02:39:13.355]  I mean, what are you talking about?
[02:39:13.355 --> 02:39:17.418]  Continuing, ladies and gentlemen, BP fixes Gulfwell.
[02:39:17.418 --> 02:39:18.899]  And then it's a spin article in the U.S.
[02:39:18.899 --> 02:39:19.099]  today.
[02:39:19.099 --> 02:39:20.300]  They said they've gotten the cap on.
[02:39:21.494 --> 02:39:22.415]  But they're not sure.
[02:39:22.415 --> 02:39:27.639]  In fact, did we ever pull up the latest live video from the wellhead?
[02:39:27.639 --> 02:39:29.660]  Can we pull up the webcam of that?
[02:39:29.660 --> 02:39:32.362]  I want to put that on screen, even if I've moved on.
[02:39:32.362 --> 02:39:38.446]  Government expert witness over 42 million gallons of dispersant used during BP oil disaster.
[02:39:38.446 --> 02:39:41.188]  That's more than 40 times what they previously claimed.
[02:39:41.188 --> 02:39:48.814]  Even professors at reports who believe that the dispersant is good, they say this is way too much to use.
[02:39:49.594 --> 02:39:50.555]  So that's the live feed.
[02:39:50.555 --> 02:39:52.576]  Does that look like that's been capped to you?
[02:39:52.576 --> 02:39:53.337]  That's the live feed?
[02:39:53.337 --> 02:39:55.218]  No, it says live.
[02:39:55.218 --> 02:39:57.000]  That's the live feed.
[02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:58.381]  Does that look like that's been capped to you?
[02:39:58.381 --> 02:40:01.303]  But hey, they say it's been capped in the USA Today, so it must be true.
[02:40:01.303 --> 02:40:02.964]  How many times have they claimed they've capped it now?
[02:40:02.964 --> 02:40:03.505]  And it's fixed?
[02:40:04.594 --> 02:40:06.795]  I wish it was true, but my God, they practice lies.
[02:40:24.880 --> 02:40:26.862]  Continuing here.
[02:40:26.862 --> 02:40:29.503]  EU approves new wave of immigrants.
[02:40:29.503 --> 02:40:30.864]  Record numbers coming in.
[02:40:30.864 --> 02:40:34.887]  They immediately get on welfare, further bankrupt the country to the private banks.
[02:40:34.887 --> 02:40:36.528]  That's out of the Express News.
[02:40:36.528 --> 02:40:37.048]  There's another one.
[02:40:37.048 --> 02:40:39.930]  Brussels goes ahead for a new wave of migrants.
[02:40:39.930 --> 02:40:44.233]  And they use the tunnel, the channel as they call it, from France to England every day.
[02:40:44.233 --> 02:40:47.836]  Unlimited illegals are allowed to just pour in to the country.
[02:40:48.536 --> 02:40:49.637]  Here's the Washington Times.
[02:41:10.151 --> 02:41:11.451]  That actively interferes.
[02:41:11.451 --> 02:41:15.372]  Yeah, by saying, if we catch an illegal in another crime, we're going to take them to the feds.
[02:41:15.372 --> 02:41:17.093]  The feds say, no!
[02:41:17.093 --> 02:41:22.154]  And then they lobby for the 800 plus cities to not stop the illegals.
[02:41:22.154 --> 02:41:30.956]  Continuing with the immigration issue, crisis for Senator Reid as critics slam Reid on immigration remark from Politico.
[02:41:30.956 --> 02:41:33.696]  And you can go watch the video of what he had to say.
[02:41:33.696 --> 02:41:36.057]  They say, we have record numbers of illegals in the
[02:41:37.489 --> 02:41:42.673]  Construction industry and they're dodging taxes and all this stuff and he says, we have no problem in Nevada.
[02:41:42.673 --> 02:41:45.215]  I mean, no problem.
[02:41:45.215 --> 02:41:50.860]  And you saw Congressman Stark two weeks ago say there's no border problem, no illegals, no immigration problem.
[02:41:50.860 --> 02:41:55.844]  They just throw it in your face and just say there are no illegal aliens working against construction in Nevada.
[02:41:55.844 --> 02:41:58.126]  It's just none of them here.
[02:41:58.126 --> 02:42:02.229]  And then the major research group, basically funded by La Raza,
[02:42:05.026 --> 02:42:10.113]  Study to try to get, I guess, voting rights or something, shows that it's actually double that.
[02:42:10.113 --> 02:42:16.662]  So double 17% in Nevada, the worst in the nation, but he says no problem.
[02:42:16.662 --> 02:42:22.510]  Continuing on the illegal alien front, Utah agencies probe alleged illegal immigrant Lyft.
[02:42:23.598 --> 02:42:34.847]  And it looks like somebody inside the state government released a list of 1,300 people that the government knows, via audits, have got fake social security numbers and they're calling this a Nazi list in the media.
[02:42:34.847 --> 02:42:36.368]  Like the government's making lists on people.
[02:42:36.368 --> 02:42:38.910]  The government's making lists on everybody dealing with taxes.
[02:42:38.910 --> 02:42:39.911]  They're tracking everybody.
[02:42:39.911 --> 02:42:41.552]  It's just the illegals are above the law.
[02:42:44.687 --> 02:42:47.468]  Continuing here, Dick Cheney undergoes heart surgery.
[02:42:47.468 --> 02:42:53.851]  He's literally like Darth Vader now and had a high-tech heart pump added to one of his ventricles to pump the blood for him.
[02:42:53.851 --> 02:42:56.512]  He's had five heart attacks and many other surgeries.
[02:42:56.512 --> 02:42:58.733]  So Satan went under the knife and lived.
[02:43:03.257 --> 02:43:03.917]  Continuing.
[02:43:03.917 --> 02:43:04.217]  U.S.
[02:43:04.217 --> 02:43:06.098]  taxpayers to subsidize new U.N.
[02:43:06.098 --> 02:43:08.178]  agency promoting abortion.
[02:43:08.178 --> 02:43:10.658]  Cyber News Service reports.
[02:43:10.658 --> 02:43:18.340]  An additional $500 million to the United Nations agency that will promote abortion agendas, including forced abortion and fantasy in China.
[02:43:18.340 --> 02:43:19.120]  They get U.N.
[02:43:19.120 --> 02:43:21.041]  awards for that.
[02:43:21.041 --> 02:43:25.842]  So that is just some of the news on that front.
[02:43:25.842 --> 02:43:27.962]  Continuing with the disinformation piece.
[02:43:29.562 --> 02:43:48.171]  Over the weekend, I got emails, I got calls, I saw messages on the text comments on InfoWars and Prison Planet saying, Alex, why aren't you covering the Taliban and monkeys that are trained with machine guns to kill our troops?
[02:43:48.171 --> 02:43:49.832]  Because I know enough about primates.
[02:43:50.612 --> 02:44:00.637]  Even chimpanzees, the most intelligent, or silverback African apes, to know that monkeys and apes cannot be trained to differentiate.
[02:44:00.637 --> 02:44:11.482]  And if you trained, I mean you might be able to train an ape or a monkey to stay behind at your house with a gun, but statistically it would end up one day having fun and shooting you not knowing.
[02:44:12.122 --> 02:44:19.548]  And so I knew it was just ridiculous, put out by our government and others, that those dirty Al-Qaeda's had armies of monkeys.
[02:44:19.548 --> 02:44:22.771]  So, this is not Planet of the Apes.
[02:44:22.771 --> 02:44:24.573]  Give me a document cam shot on that.
[02:44:24.573 --> 02:44:26.354]  This is not Planet of the Apes, my friends.
[02:44:26.354 --> 02:44:28.256]  That's only in the Hollywood movies.
[02:44:28.256 --> 02:44:32.359]  But, you know, the CIA admits they put out fake Al-Qaeda bin Laden tapes.
[02:44:32.359 --> 02:44:36.543]  That's now admitted, what, a month and a half ago, in the Washington Post.
[02:44:36.543 --> 02:44:38.844]  And they admit they put out fake videos for you now.
[02:44:39.705 --> 02:44:45.589]  And they claim they kill Al-Qaeda leaders over and over and over again and never retract the last time they killed the same leader.
[02:44:45.589 --> 02:44:49.291]  So why not tell you deadly monkeys are coming and Planet of the Apes is real?
[02:44:49.291 --> 02:44:55.455]  I mean, this is just amazing developments on that front.
[02:44:55.455 --> 02:45:08.123]  Going over the economy here, top Clinton official, only a terror attack can save Obama, told the Financial Times of London that, Robert Shapiro, saying the only way he can rally and look like a strong leader is for an Oklahoma City or
[02:45:09.227 --> 02:45:11.869]  9-11 type attack, that information is key.
[02:45:11.869 --> 02:45:12.810]  In fact, here's just the quote.
[02:45:12.810 --> 02:45:18.415]  The bottom line here is that Americans don't believe in President Obama's leadership, said Robert Shapiro.
[02:45:18.415 --> 02:45:26.402]  He has to find some way between now and November of demonstrating that he is a leader who can command confidence in short of a 9-11 event or an Oklahoma City bombing.
[02:45:26.402 --> 02:45:28.924]  I can't think of how he could do just that.
[02:45:31.460 --> 02:45:33.741]  Continuing, road warrior level collapse imminent.
[02:45:33.741 --> 02:45:36.022]  Alex Jones says we must take corrective action now.
[02:45:36.022 --> 02:45:44.106]  Key video and article at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:45:44.106 --> 02:45:47.707]  Continuing, CNBC, world at risk of folding in on itself.
[02:45:47.707 --> 02:45:58.792]  The global economy is at a risk of folding in on itself unless policy makers face up to the threat of inflation and exchange rate inflexibility according to monetary director of fixed
[02:45:59.804 --> 02:46:00.264]  We're good to go.
[02:46:26.101 --> 02:46:30.123]  There are a huge backlog of borrowers who have fallen behind in their loans.
[02:46:30.123 --> 02:46:31.143]  Fox News.
[02:46:31.143 --> 02:46:32.264]  Here's another one.
[02:46:32.264 --> 02:46:34.925]  After fits and starts, bank bill ready for passage.
[02:46:34.925 --> 02:46:35.565]  AP.
[02:46:35.565 --> 02:46:42.588]  This gives more power to the Federal Reserve than what they got with their first takeover of our economy in 1913.
[02:46:42.588 --> 02:46:44.429]  So, that nightmare is set to go through.
[02:46:44.429 --> 02:46:53.113]  JP Morgan earns $4.8 billion in second quarter, an all-time record, and the other big six banks that own the Federal Reserve also posting record profits.
[02:46:54.591 --> 02:47:00.542]  Continuing, a financial bill favors interest of unions and activists.
[02:47:00.542 --> 02:47:02.525]  That's just a Washington Times right-wing whitewash.
[02:47:02.525 --> 02:47:04.348]  They got big Republican support for this bill.
[02:47:05.638 --> 02:47:08.721]  Senate VIP Loans Mount Wall Street Journal.
[02:47:08.721 --> 02:47:08.922]  U.S.
[02:47:08.922 --> 02:47:21.755]  Senators and State Senate employees received 30 loans, far more than had previously been known, under a controversial lending program at Countrywide Financial Corps that provided cut-rate terms for favored borrowers, a form of payoff.
[02:47:21.755 --> 02:47:23.937]  Continuing, bank repossesses U.S.
[02:47:23.937 --> 02:47:24.918]  homes at record pace.
[02:47:24.918 --> 02:47:25.519]  That's Reuters.
[02:47:28.462 --> 02:47:29.443]  Continuing, the U.S.
[02:47:29.443 --> 02:47:30.605]  economy is a dead horse.
[02:47:30.605 --> 02:47:35.011]  The American people are starting to get really angry over this and get frustrated.
[02:47:35.011 --> 02:47:38.675]  Economic collapse reports.
[02:47:38.675 --> 02:47:41.179]  That is just some of the news and information.
[02:47:43.729 --> 02:47:51.377]  There's more and more taxes being passed that are aimed at people's social behavior, but next it'll be beef and beer and things like that.
[02:47:51.377 --> 02:47:51.657]  U.S.
[02:47:51.657 --> 02:47:54.300]  pockets $20.6 billion in sin taxes.
[02:47:54.300 --> 02:47:59.906]  In fiscal year 2009, those numbers have now come in to Reuters, so that also targets the poorest Americans.
[02:48:01.218 --> 02:48:05.441]  Obama enlists Bill Clinton to aid him on the economy.
[02:48:05.441 --> 02:48:23.996]  Bill Clinton, now because Obama's ratings have fallen to 40 or below, Clinton's are a little bit higher, so they're enlisting that shyster and scam artist and fraud to go out and dupe all of the people to push his supposed economic reforms.
[02:48:23.996 --> 02:48:25.698]  So that is just some
[02:48:27.637 --> 02:48:31.679]  of the information that we have on the financial front.
[02:48:31.679 --> 02:48:37.381]  On the international military front, study says that an attack on Iran would be the start of a long war.
[02:48:37.381 --> 02:48:40.842]  Iran's response to an attack could send oil prices through the roofs.
[02:48:40.842 --> 02:48:47.705]  Think Tank argues an Israeli attack on Iran would fail to stop Tehran's alleged nuclear weapons program and would lead to a long war.
[02:48:47.705 --> 02:48:51.206]  That's exactly what the Iran Corporation called for two years ago.
[02:48:51.206 --> 02:48:56.148]  That would be marked by economic instability and mass civilian casualties.
[02:48:58.601 --> 02:49:00.583]  Says a study from a British think tank.
[02:49:00.583 --> 02:49:15.781]  And a report released Wednesday by the Oxford Research Group stated that while the likelihood of a US attack on Iran's nuclear program has been lessened by the Obama administration's policies, that's not true, they're building up for it, advances in Israeli military technology have increased the potential for an Israeli attack.
[02:49:15.781 --> 02:49:18.464]  The study entitled, Military Action Against Iran Impacted
[02:49:19.025 --> 02:49:19.165]  I think?
[02:49:43.951 --> 02:49:45.953]  Prioritizing nuclear weapons, the report says.
[02:49:45.953 --> 02:49:52.198]  They've already tried to have a peaceful program and had the uranium enriched by the West, but the globalists said no.
[02:49:52.198 --> 02:49:53.639]  Continuing, the U.S.
[02:49:53.639 --> 02:50:00.485]  paid Iranian nuclear scientists, the Washington Post reports, $5 million for aid to CIA, basically a payoff to lie for them.
[02:50:02.054 --> 02:50:04.917]  Iranian nuclear scientist returns home to a hero's welcome.
[02:50:04.917 --> 02:50:13.764]  An Iranian nuclear scientist at the center of a bizarre espionage drama arrived here to a hero's welcome Thursday morning, including a personal greeting from several senior government officials.
[02:50:13.764 --> 02:50:16.146]  He's the guy claiming he was kidnapped by U.S.
[02:50:16.146 --> 02:50:22.992]  intelligence forces 14 months ago at Mecca in Saudi Arabia.
[02:50:22.992 --> 02:50:24.694]  And so it continues.
[02:50:26.254 --> 02:50:28.435]  We're going to come back and continue in the final segment.
[02:50:28.435 --> 02:50:36.538]  I won't have time to get to the rest of the callers, but I'm going to come back and blitz through more news on the other side of this quick break.

[02:52:01.365 --> 02:52:06.328]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:52:06.328 --> 02:52:07.329]  What have we got?
[02:52:07.329 --> 02:52:09.771]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:52:09.771 --> 02:52:10.791]  A republic.
[02:52:10.791 --> 02:52:13.433]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:52:13.433 --> 02:52:15.694]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:52:15.694 --> 02:52:17.716]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:52:17.716 --> 02:52:19.397]  So they think they own our land?
[02:52:19.397 --> 02:52:20.718]  They think they own our water?
[02:52:20.718 --> 02:52:21.318]  Children?
[02:52:21.318 --> 02:52:22.459]  Our education?
[02:52:22.459 --> 02:52:23.279]  Our money?
[02:52:23.279 --> 02:52:26.942]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:52:27.282 --> 02:52:30.987]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:52:30.987 --> 02:52:32.269]  You have been warned.

[02:54:52.825 --> 02:54:53.645]  They talk about how
[02:55:00.046 --> 02:55:02.127]  What woke them up was the films.
[02:55:02.127 --> 02:55:04.248]  Well, somebody gave you the film.
[02:55:04.248 --> 02:55:07.010]  If you've already got my films, make copies, get them out to people.
[02:55:07.010 --> 02:55:12.713]  This is how we're affecting change in a big, big way.
[02:55:12.713 --> 02:55:15.634]  Here's just something fun, something interesting.
[02:55:15.634 --> 02:55:18.336]  This is out of the New York Times, 18th century ship.
[02:55:19.332 --> 02:55:21.714]  Found at World Trade Center site.
[02:55:21.714 --> 02:55:23.916]  It had been a big marsh.
[02:55:23.916 --> 02:55:41.950]  And it says that on Tuesday morning, workers excavated the site of the Underground Vehicle Security Center from the future World Trade Center, hit by a row of sturdy upright wood timbers, regularly spaced, sticking out of the briny gray muck flecked with oyster shells.
[02:55:41.950 --> 02:55:45.633]  And they found an ancient ship, several hundred years old.
[02:55:45.633 --> 02:55:46.574]  So that's interesting.
[02:55:48.175 --> 02:55:56.119]  In other news, Right to Die billboard causes uproar in New Jersey.
[02:55:56.119 --> 02:56:04.364]  Final Exit Network says it provides guidance to adults with painful illnesses and basically promotes options of suicide.
[02:56:04.364 --> 02:56:08.226]  I'm against their idea of pushing suicide, but I support their First Amendment.
[02:56:09.653 --> 02:56:18.097]  They're now going to take down the billboard comparing Hitler and his socialism to Obama and his socialism and Lenin's socialism.
[02:56:18.097 --> 02:56:19.498]  I wonder if this will be taken down.
[02:56:19.498 --> 02:56:22.259]  I wonder if people demand this be taken down.
[02:56:22.259 --> 02:56:27.381]  Because if you get rid of all the speech you don't like, there'll be no speech left.
[02:56:27.381 --> 02:56:32.344]  Continuing here with an amazing report, and this is hot off the presses.

[02:56:36.880 --> 02:56:38.802]  That's GCNlive.com.
[02:56:38.802 --> 02:56:46.370]  Declassified Vietnam-era transcripts show senators knew Gulf of Tonkin was a staged false flag event.
[02:56:46.370 --> 02:56:51.915]  Of course, they declassified on the 40th anniversary six years ago of the Gulf of Tonkin in 2004.
[02:56:53.777 --> 02:57:01.161]  That it had been staged in the LBJ audio tapes with McNamara at the time, days before they were planning to stage it on the phone recording it.
[02:57:01.161 --> 02:57:08.646]  Well now, elected reps chose to hide details from American public for fear of reprisals from the quote big forces.
[02:57:09.366 --> 02:57:13.449]  See, they were scared for their lives, that run the media and the presidency.
[02:57:13.449 --> 02:57:29.583]  Over 1,100 pages of previously classified Vietnam-era transcripts released this week by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee highlight the fact that several senators knew the White House and the Pentagon had deceived the American people over the 64 Gulf of Tonkin incident.
[02:57:29.583 --> 02:57:34.046]  The latest releases, which document skepticism of the pretext for the entry in the Vietnam War,
[02:57:35.127 --> 02:57:37.828]  Date from 1968, four years into the war.
[02:57:37.828 --> 02:57:45.090]  Senators were at loggerheads with Lyndon B. Johnson at the time of the Foreign Relations Committee meetings, were behind closed doors.
[02:57:45.090 --> 02:57:51.352]  They discussed bringing the information out, but said they would be destroyed by the quote, big forces.
[02:57:51.352 --> 02:58:00.135]  And now it turns out Google is spying on Congress, and the NSA is, and the British echelon system is spying on their parliament.
[02:58:01.445 --> 02:58:03.447]  This is tyranny by special interest.
[02:58:03.447 --> 02:58:07.109]  Our country and the world has been taken over by private corporations.
[02:58:07.109 --> 02:58:09.531]  The New World Order is a private corporate takeover.
[02:58:09.531 --> 02:58:12.674]  Globalism is treason against national sovereignty.
[02:58:12.674 --> 02:58:15.776]  And some of you Star Trek heads say, well, that's what it is in Star Trek.
[02:58:15.776 --> 02:58:17.097]  We'll be one world.
[02:58:17.097 --> 02:58:19.479]  This is a tyranny they're setting up.
[02:58:19.479 --> 02:58:22.521]  This is not a place where you get any due process or rights.
[02:58:22.521 --> 02:58:27.325]  They want to replace the Bill of Rights and Constitution with a tyranny.
[02:58:27.325 --> 02:58:28.186]  Do you understand that?
[02:58:29.355 --> 02:58:32.180]  All right, coming up, ladies and gentlemen, a lot of key information.
