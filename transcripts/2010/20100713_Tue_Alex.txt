[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.201]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:00:11.201 --> 00:00:18.083]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:18.083 --> 00:00:21.643]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:21.643 --> 00:00:24.544]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:24.544 --> 00:00:28.825]  We're going to be simulcasting a full three hours of the syndicated radio broadcast.
[00:00:29.781 --> 00:00:32.982]  Live at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:00:32.982 --> 00:00:34.143]  We have no guests today.
[00:00:34.143 --> 00:00:45.948]  It's going to be a ton of news, key subjects that affect human society on this planet and our future destiny, and of course, your phone calls throughout the full transmission today.
[00:00:47.476 --> 00:00:54.478]  I hear you can see via the document cam if you're watching on PrisonPlanet.TV all the different stacks of news.
[00:00:54.478 --> 00:01:02.100]  Let me just read to you some of the headlines and then I'll start burrowing into them after the first segment is over.
[00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.742]  CNN's Sanchez dead Africans good for war against manufactured terror.
[00:01:08.362 --> 00:01:09.303]  He actually said that.
[00:01:09.303 --> 00:01:11.103]  That's Kurt Nemo, InfoWars.com.
[00:01:11.103 --> 00:01:12.564]  That video clip's coming up.
[00:01:12.564 --> 00:01:16.946]  Here's another key article on the same subject by Paul Joseph Watson at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:16.946 --> 00:01:22.329]  CNN host calls deadly terror bombings helpful to New World Order agenda.
[00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:24.971]  You cannot make this type of craziness up.
[00:01:24.971 --> 00:01:26.751]  Now here's some other news.
[00:01:26.751 --> 00:01:33.315]  FDA panel to review safety of diabetes drug, Avandian, causing heart attacks.
[00:01:35.322 --> 00:01:37.403]  What drug do they not admit causes heart attacks?
[00:01:37.403 --> 00:01:39.004]  They're now admitting Prozac causes it.
[00:01:39.004 --> 00:01:41.246]  They knew that in 81 when they approved it.
[00:01:41.246 --> 00:01:41.866]  Here's another one.
[00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:44.248]  Do sweeteners bring on early birth?
[00:01:44.248 --> 00:01:47.350]  How fizzy drinks can harm an unborn child?
[00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.453]  And then it goes on to report that the EU research did find that aspartame does this.
[00:01:52.453 --> 00:01:53.634]  Funny.
[00:01:53.634 --> 00:02:04.782]  They failed to approve aspartame three times in the 1970s, and we've had medical doctors on, like Blaylock, to read the studies to you on air that were conducted by Searle, part of Monsanto.
[00:02:05.702 --> 00:02:06.802]  A division.
[00:02:06.802 --> 00:02:09.723]  And of course it was headed up by Donald Rumsfeld at the time.
[00:02:09.723 --> 00:02:22.785]  And in the rhesus monkey studies they did, they found massive increases in early births, miscarriages, and then if they fed aspartame in the milk to the rhesus monkeys, most of them died.
[00:02:22.785 --> 00:02:25.506]  Now of course it's in thousands and thousands of products.
[00:02:25.506 --> 00:02:28.426]  Good luck finding sugar candy that doesn't have it added.
[00:02:28.426 --> 00:02:32.167]  All part of a New World Order treat for you and your family.
[00:02:32.167 --> 00:02:33.547]  Oh, but that's not what's important.
[00:02:34.252 --> 00:02:38.133]  No, Jesse Jackson's now saying it's racist to criticize LeBron James.
[00:02:38.133 --> 00:02:39.814]  That's what's really important.
[00:02:39.814 --> 00:02:48.716]  Let's abort 51% of black people and have the liberal NAACP promoting it, but let's not talk bad about LeBron James.
[00:02:48.716 --> 00:02:49.476]  Here's another one.
[00:02:49.476 --> 00:02:52.057]  FDA nears approval of genetically engineered salmon.
[00:02:52.637 --> 00:02:55.199]  And of course they've already had these for more than a decade.
[00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:59.722]  They have insect genes mixed with them for some reason.
[00:02:59.722 --> 00:03:14.433]  And a Purdue University study using high-tech computer models found that 60% of transgenetic fish bred in a population of 60,000 wild fish, the wild fish would be extinct in 40 generations.
[00:03:14.433 --> 00:03:16.294]  So I thought we'd go over that.
[00:03:16.294 --> 00:03:17.696]  That's from McClatchy News.
[00:03:18.416 --> 00:03:22.801]  You're already eating cloned hog, cloned beef, and of course, cloned chicken.
[00:03:22.801 --> 00:03:24.262]  Enjoy it!
[00:03:24.262 --> 00:03:25.844]  But this is a transgenetic.
[00:03:25.844 --> 00:03:27.586]  It's been mixed with other species.
[00:03:27.586 --> 00:03:32.211]  Pharmacists give themselves cancer from dispensing toxic chemotherapy chemicals.
[00:03:32.211 --> 00:03:33.452]  We'll be covering that.
[00:03:33.452 --> 00:03:40.599]  Also, scientists develop fake genetically engineered blood from the battlefield made from baby's umbilical cords.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.681]  Of course, that allows massive mutations, but it doesn't matter.
[00:03:45.681 --> 00:03:46.781]  Just go ahead and do it.
[00:03:46.781 --> 00:03:47.861]  Everything's fine.
[00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:52.522]  The government will just cover up what that causes, the havoc that that wreaks.
[00:03:52.522 --> 00:03:56.543]  And we'll continue going over all of that stack.
[00:03:56.543 --> 00:03:58.244]  That is one stack.
[00:03:58.244 --> 00:04:02.405]  I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[00:04:02.405 --> 00:04:05.985]  Nine stacks here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:05.985 --> 00:04:08.266]  And again, that's just one little stack.
[00:04:10.524 --> 00:04:14.486]  And that's not even all the genetic engineering news that came out today.
[00:04:14.486 --> 00:04:15.767]  Today.
[00:04:15.767 --> 00:04:17.168]  Today.
[00:04:17.168 --> 00:04:19.509]  And in every study, it's wreaking havoc.
[00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:22.891]  But this is being done by design, and we will explain it.
[00:04:22.891 --> 00:04:27.913]  What did Monsanto say more than a decade ago in an interview with the National Geographic?
[00:04:27.913 --> 00:04:36.738]  They said, our goal is to take over the entire biosphere of the Earth, patent everything, and to have our genetically modified organisms take over the planet.
[00:04:36.738 --> 00:04:37.619]  This is playing God.
[00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:40.364]  But that's just part of what's coming up today.
[00:04:40.364 --> 00:04:42.428]  I'll get into central banks, start to abandon U.S.
[00:04:42.428 --> 00:04:43.351]  dollars, CNN.
[00:04:43.351 --> 00:04:47.320]  I will get into Fidel Castro says World War III and nuclear war is about to begin.
[00:04:48.336 --> 00:04:56.659]  They're announcing all over the country, even in major cities, here's one out of NBC, that in Oakland, the police will not respond to most crimes due to budget cuts.
[00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:58.100]  They will be there writing you tickets, though.
[00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.720]  Revenue generation is numero uno.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.881]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.881 --> 00:05:05.342]  Alex Jones here with urgent information concerning TrendsResearch.com.

[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.883]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:06:04.883 --> 00:06:11.288]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:06:11.288 --> 00:06:18.694]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:06:18.694 --> 00:06:23.558]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:06:53.502 --> 00:06:54.303]  Thank you!
[00:07:02.335 --> 00:07:06.296]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:06.296 --> 00:07:15.138]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:07:15.138 --> 00:07:19.779]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:30.601]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:40.743]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:40.743 --> 00:07:46.165]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:07:46.165 --> 00:07:53.646]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:53.646 --> 00:07:56.407]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:08:06.158 --> 00:08:11.002]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:11.002 --> 00:08:12.584]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.584 --> 00:08:14.125]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:14.125 --> 00:08:18.329]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.329 --> 00:08:22.392]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:23.914 --> 00:08:27.157]  Look at this headline out of Wired Magazine.
[00:08:27.157 --> 00:08:30.740]  Terahertz detectors can see through your clothes from a mile away.
[00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:35.265]  Part of biometric body scanning and weapons detection.
[00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:42.492]  Of course, I remember Alexander Haig more than a decade ago admitting they have giant blimps they were testing to be tethered over all U.S.
[00:08:42.492 --> 00:08:42.872]  cities.
[00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:50.517]  To terahertz scan your body and people laughed about it even though that's what Alexander Haig said they were planning.
[00:08:50.517 --> 00:08:53.619]  Now those blimps are over every major U.S.
[00:08:53.619 --> 00:08:57.562]  city and they're now announcing it to the slaves.
[00:08:57.562 --> 00:09:08.629]  So I'll be discussing this beast grid where they track everyone via body scan, face scan and from above with the image of the top of your head and your shoulders they have a 100%
[00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:13.911]  Heat Resonance Biometric System as well.
[00:09:13.911 --> 00:09:30.375]  Highly classified, but in DARPA documents that have come out 15 years ago and about 8 years ago, and of course a year and a half ago, in Bob Woodward's new book where he talked about the secret weapon they've got in Iraq, it is the Heat Resonance Biometric System.
[00:09:30.375 --> 00:09:35.577]  This is the type of incredible high-tech control grid they've got in place right now.
[00:09:36.337 --> 00:09:41.222]  You notice suddenly, all over the country, they're slapping toll roads on existing roads.
[00:09:41.222 --> 00:09:44.084]  And people go, well, there's no toll booths.
[00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:46.186]  And they say, don't worry.
[00:09:46.186 --> 00:09:48.708]  You drive on this road, we mail you the bill.
[00:09:49.776 --> 00:09:52.018]  And that's how they're doing it all over Central Texas.
[00:09:52.018 --> 00:09:53.660]  You just drive on the highway.
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.683]  They've got new toll roads opening where you cannot buy a transponder.
[00:09:56.683 --> 00:09:58.265]  You cannot pay cash.
[00:09:58.265 --> 00:09:59.526]  You will be scanned.
[00:09:59.526 --> 00:10:01.047]  Your license plate will be scanned.
[00:10:01.047 --> 00:10:02.589]  You will pay that way.
[00:10:02.589 --> 00:10:04.251]  And the public's been in such denial.
[00:10:04.251 --> 00:10:11.338]  I would read government documents six, seven, eight years ago about these scanners going in for your license plates, and people would send me emails laughing.
[00:10:11.338 --> 00:10:13.300]  Well, folks are not laughing now.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.441]  So that's also coming up later in the transmission.
[00:10:17.441 --> 00:10:18.721]  We are live, of course.
[00:10:18.721 --> 00:10:24.783]  It is the 13th day of July 2010 on this Tuesday edition.
[00:10:24.783 --> 00:10:32.705]  Of course, for the first 14 years of the broadcast or so, I did three hours a day, and then about two and a half years ago, I went to four hours a day.
[00:10:32.705 --> 00:10:38.127]  But because I have completed my new TV studios, well, I've completed the building and much of the studio,
[00:10:38.607 --> 00:10:45.510]  I'm preparing to start developing that, and I just don't have the time and energy to make films, do the TV show, and do four hours.
[00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:49.712]  But we are rebroadcasting the first hour and the fourth hour for stations that are carrying it.
[00:10:49.712 --> 00:10:54.994]  And I will, at least once a week in the future, be doing the fourth hour live.
[00:10:54.994 --> 00:10:57.455]  And sometimes I'll do the entire week in the fourth hour live.
[00:10:57.455 --> 00:11:04.418]  It's just that we are now starting to migrate over a little bit with our time and energy towards the television end of things.
[00:11:05.558 --> 00:11:13.047]  I found that doing a fourth hour takes me about 30 minutes to an hour just to recuperate mentally and get some sugars back in my brain.
[00:11:13.047 --> 00:11:14.850]  I mean, I feel great after the show.
[00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:23.821]  I just am psychologically and mentally and spiritually exhausted and then I have to kind of go sit on a couch for about 30 minutes to even get my bearings.
[00:11:24.361 --> 00:11:24.682]  I think?
[00:11:46.321 --> 00:11:47.942]  on a routine basis for folks.
[00:11:47.942 --> 00:11:58.846]  That will just be overdrive, but it will be offered on the satellites and other systems for stations, so key information on that front for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and others.
[00:11:58.846 --> 00:12:13.992]  But we are now going to be simulcasting every day, the full three hours, just at the start to the finish, at PrisonPlanet.tv, and of course that will be archived each day, not just the live stream, but the archive of this transmission will be posted there for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:12:15.649 --> 00:12:30.973]  In the first little segment, I got into just some amazing news and information dealing with biotech, genetic engineering, genetically engineered cows, pigs, fish, salmon, genetically engineered fake human blood.
[00:12:30.973 --> 00:12:32.994]  I want to go over some of the dangers of that.
[00:12:32.994 --> 00:12:38.135]  They're now admitting in mainstream news that aspartame does cause miscarriages and lower birth weights.
[00:12:38.915 --> 00:12:57.010]  Since Aspartame became popular in the last 29 years, since it was approved, since that happened in 1981, we've seen birth weights and miscarriages go way up in the entire industrialized world and now there's more major studies on that front.
[00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:01.033]  So we'll be breaking that down for folks coming up.
[00:13:01.994 --> 00:13:05.376]  And some of the other news, I'm going to get into central banks start to abandon the U.S.
[00:13:05.376 --> 00:13:10.539]  dollar, Chinese rating agency strips, Western nations of AAA status.
[00:13:10.539 --> 00:13:13.140]  That's from CNN and the London Telegraph.
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:16.862]  New York Times, crisis awaits world banks as trillions come due.
[00:13:16.862 --> 00:13:20.344]  Another headline, London Telegraph, secret gold swap has...
[00:13:21.244 --> 00:13:23.207]  Spooked the market.
[00:13:23.207 --> 00:13:28.273]  Fox News report, Republicans sound warning over expiration of Bush tax cuts.
[00:13:28.273 --> 00:13:29.856]  Yeah, you think the economy's stalled now.
[00:13:29.856 --> 00:13:31.758]  Wait till those expire.
[00:13:31.758 --> 00:13:35.223]  The big crash, America plunges into depression.
[00:13:35.223 --> 00:13:36.464]  This by Alexander Cockburn.
[00:13:37.837 --> 00:13:39.318]  Also on the politics stack here.
[00:14:03.894 --> 00:14:06.796]  Washington Post, confidence in Obama reaches new low.
[00:14:06.796 --> 00:14:19.083]  Washington Post, ABC News poll finds, and these are even Cook polls, but you're talking about basically roughly about a 40% approval rating for the president.
[00:14:19.083 --> 00:14:22.646]  Here's another one, majority of Americans lack faith in Obama.
[00:14:22.646 --> 00:14:24.427]  Poll shows Reuters.
[00:14:24.427 --> 00:14:29.150]  Here's one out of the AP, Obama poll.
[00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:32.131]  Opinion poll.
[00:14:32.131 --> 00:14:34.913]  Public sides with Arizona over U.S.
[00:14:34.913 --> 00:14:39.556]  on new immigration law.
[00:14:39.556 --> 00:14:47.942]  So that shows that all the media spin and disinformation and the hoax that they've launched saying that it's about racism is completely failing.
[00:14:47.942 --> 00:14:48.943]  Also, key U.S.
[00:14:48.943 --> 00:14:51.945]  Senate panel puts off Supreme Court vote.
[00:14:51.945 --> 00:14:59.170]  This is out of AFP, but it's seen as largely symbolic because they're just gonna vote in the committee a week later
[00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:00.311]  I don't
[00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:22.853]  We are dying as a free nation, as the rest of the world is as well, under the same globalist management.
[00:15:22.853 --> 00:15:34.359]  This is a woman who openly is anti-free speech, openly anti-Second Amendment, openly anti-family, openly authoritarian, and will be the worst Supreme Court Justice in history, there's no doubt.
[00:15:34.359 --> 00:15:39.761]  I mean, no one has ever been this bold in saying they can disappear free speech, that's a quote.
[00:15:39.761 --> 00:15:43.023]  Rand Paul, meanwhile, is under fire for saying poor in the U.S.
[00:15:43.023 --> 00:15:45.584]  better off than poor elsewhere, citing government studies.
[00:15:47.065 --> 00:15:50.006]  How is he under attack for that?
[00:15:50.006 --> 00:16:01.211]  I point out that the poor in this country are per capita, would be considered wealthy compared to people in Latin America and Africa and poor areas of Asia.
[00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:05.933]  There are many areas of the world where people make less than $500 a year.
[00:16:05.933 --> 00:16:09.054]  There's some countries, in fact, I want the actual statistics.
[00:16:09.054 --> 00:16:09.855]  Will you guys pull up
[00:16:11.872 --> 00:16:20.858]  uh... yearly pay averages nation by nation because i know some nations they make less than a hundred dollars a year uh... and and and that's converted into u.s.
[00:16:20.858 --> 00:16:37.850]  dollars and of course the poorest people in the united states or at least getting around fourteen thousand dollars or more in welfare uh... so uh... this is the way they attack uh... ran paul was just absolute garbage another key story in the politics section of info wars dot com present on the dot com boulder berg
[00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:41.851]  Corporate media mogul wrote speech for Obama.
[00:16:41.851 --> 00:16:49.272]  Paul Joseph Watson, New Revelation, emphasizes fact that Obama is nothing more than a sock puppet for the global elite.
[00:16:49.272 --> 00:17:00.854]  And on Neil Cavuto's program yesterday, Mortimer Zuckerman wrote that, yes, he writes Obama's speeches and also said that Obama is treading water.
[00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:04.815]  But, of course, Obama went to that Bilderberg meeting and they decided at that meeting
[00:17:05.717 --> 00:17:09.660]  That Hillary would step down and be the head of the State Department.
[00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:10.960]  We were at that event.
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.342]  We knew where to be there in Virginia.
[00:17:13.342 --> 00:17:18.045]  The rest of the media knew full well where Obama and Hillary were, but played along with the ruse.
[00:17:18.045 --> 00:17:22.148]  And then after the meeting, that next day, they announced that Hillary would be stepping down.
[00:17:22.148 --> 00:17:26.410]  So, just to show you the power of the Bilderberg Group, very important article there.
[00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:31.414]  Another story, Obama to attend groundbreaking for LG Chem Plant in the United States.
[00:17:32.637 --> 00:17:32.837]  This is
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:54.680]  I don't
[00:18:15.384 --> 00:18:23.954]  I mean, how about criticizing Obama for giving billions of dollars to move a GM plant to Brazil or GM plants to Russia or Eastern Europe or China?
[00:18:23.954 --> 00:18:25.536]  That is very serious.
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:33.562]  I do have a problem with it being a Korean company, but there's much bigger fish to fry.
[00:18:33.562 --> 00:18:41.886]  And the Koreans, of course, have a much better liking for the United States than many of these other globalist operation-run countries.
[00:18:41.886 --> 00:18:48.528]  Michelle Obama rouses NAACP before vote, condemning racist elements of the Tea Party.
[00:18:48.528 --> 00:18:54.491]  And we have time later, I'll play a clip of this, but she got up there and said, black people are in trouble.
[00:18:54.491 --> 00:18:56.732]  Black people are being hit hardest by the recession.
[00:18:58.137 --> 00:18:58.197]  Yes.
[00:19:13.988 --> 00:19:27.827]  Before the Great Society and before black women were paid to not have a man in the house, you had less than 50% illegitimacy and you had very wealthy, affluent black areas in every city who own their own businesses.
[00:19:28.871 --> 00:19:30.212]  And those are gone now.
[00:19:30.212 --> 00:19:33.193]  And you have over 90% illegitimacy.
[00:19:33.193 --> 00:19:39.477]  And of course, more than half of black males end up basically spending more than a decade in prison.
[00:19:39.477 --> 00:19:42.218]  The numbers are much higher than a half.
[00:19:42.218 --> 00:19:51.844]  And of course, the quote, liberal black leaders are there to ensure eugenics are carried out and that more than 51% of blacks are aborted before they ever exist.
[00:19:51.844 --> 00:19:53.925]  And Obama has massively increased abortion
[00:20:02.292 --> 00:20:06.055]  So you think the massive Gulf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe?
[00:20:06.055 --> 00:20:07.376]  Think again.
[00:20:07.376 --> 00:20:15.022]  Benzene, a toxic gas emitted from crude oil and a known carcinogen, is now airborne traveling hundreds, even thousands of miles inland.
[00:20:15.022 --> 00:20:21.948]  Whether you live near the Gulf or not, benzene and other volatile organic compounds could cause adverse reactions to those living inside your home.
[00:20:22.248 --> 00:20:30.811]  NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, came to airfiltersandpurifiers.com for answers on how to clean the air on boats aiding in the Gulf Cleanup.
[00:20:30.811 --> 00:20:31.911]  Do what NOAA did.

[00:20:58.488 --> 00:21:00.430]  Your trusted advisor for clean air.
[00:21:01.357 --> 00:21:11.379]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[00:21:11.379 --> 00:21:17.801]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[00:21:17.801 --> 00:21:26.663]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[00:21:27.043 --> 00:21:36.235]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[00:21:36.235 --> 00:21:41.222]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[00:21:41.222 --> 00:21:42.643]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:42.643 --> 00:21:45.147]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[00:21:45.427 --> 00:21:47.108]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[00:21:47.108 --> 00:21:52.931]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[00:21:52.931 --> 00:21:53.672]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.672 --> 00:21:54.012]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.414 --> 00:22:06.378]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:22:06.378 --> 00:22:07.378]  What have we got?
[00:22:07.378 --> 00:22:09.820]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:10.841]  A republic.
[00:22:10.841 --> 00:22:13.483]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:22:13.483 --> 00:22:15.745]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:22:15.745 --> 00:22:17.766]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:22:17.766 --> 00:22:19.447]  So they think they own our land?
[00:22:19.447 --> 00:22:20.768]  They think they own our water?
[00:22:20.768 --> 00:22:21.369]  Children?
[00:22:21.369 --> 00:22:22.510]  Our education?
[00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:23.330]  Our money?
[00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:26.993]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:22:27.353 --> 00:22:32.318]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:22:32.318 --> 00:22:33.339]  We have the facts.
[00:22:33.339 --> 00:22:34.500]  We have the Constitution.
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:35.401]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:22:35.401 --> 00:22:36.302]  We have common law.
[00:22:36.302 --> 00:22:38.824]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:38.824 --> 00:22:42.608]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:22:42.708 --> 00:22:47.651]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:22:47.651 --> 00:22:49.152]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:22:49.152 --> 00:22:50.232]  Don't tread on me.
[00:22:50.232 --> 00:22:56.315]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:04.552]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[00:23:04.552 --> 00:23:06.633]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[00:23:06.633 --> 00:23:09.375]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[00:23:09.375 --> 00:23:11.596]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[00:23:11.596 --> 00:23:13.017]  Okay, here it comes.
[00:23:13.017 --> 00:23:14.919]  But first, the facts.
[00:23:14.919 --> 00:23:16.840]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.841]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[00:23:18.841 --> 00:23:22.524]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[00:23:22.524 --> 00:23:30.268]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[00:23:30.268 --> 00:23:30.889]  Sinofresh.

[00:23:51.825 --> 00:23:52.185]  It works!
[00:24:12.827 --> 00:24:13.788]  We are back live.
[00:24:13.788 --> 00:24:16.070]  Thank you for joining us on this Tuesday transmission.
[00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:19.472]  We're going to be opening the phones up later in the hour.
[00:24:19.472 --> 00:24:21.514]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:24:21.514 --> 00:24:22.615]  Wide open phones, 800-259-9231.
[00:24:22.615 --> 00:24:25.977]  We're going to take calls throughout the full broadcast today.
[00:24:35.225 --> 00:24:37.567]  Okay, let's continue with the stacks here.
[00:24:37.567 --> 00:24:43.253]  Let's go ahead and get into the financial group of important news today.
[00:24:43.253 --> 00:24:46.155]  And there's even more that we're going to cover later.
[00:24:46.155 --> 00:24:48.117]  But let me start getting into this now.
[00:24:48.117 --> 00:24:50.459]  Central banks start to abandon the U.S.
[00:24:50.459 --> 00:24:50.779]  dollar.
[00:24:51.687 --> 00:24:55.832]  How long have we talked about this here on the broadcast?
[00:24:55.832 --> 00:24:58.575]  How long have we been criticized for putting out Glim and Doom?
[00:24:58.575 --> 00:25:03.021]  I mean, I've read the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:25:03.021 --> 00:25:08.948]  I've read what the United Nations has said for more than a decade that they plan to build their world empire with U.S.
[00:25:08.948 --> 00:25:09.168]  money.
[00:25:10.109 --> 00:25:16.574]  And then blame the United States for all the crimes they've committed, and then implode our economy and bring it into receivership.
[00:25:16.574 --> 00:25:20.337]  The United States cannot be number one if you're going to have a world government.
[00:25:20.337 --> 00:25:21.378]  What has Obama said?
[00:25:21.378 --> 00:25:26.182]  That part of globalism is that no nation can be wealthier or greater than any other.
[00:25:26.182 --> 00:25:30.205]  All must be lowered so the international elite can control society.
[00:25:30.205 --> 00:25:32.327]  And what has the news been reporting the last two days?
[00:25:32.327 --> 00:25:33.528]  Headlines everywhere?
[00:25:33.528 --> 00:25:35.930]  China to be the new engine of the world.
[00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:37.551]  China to save the world.
[00:25:37.551 --> 00:25:39.413]  China to be the industrialized giant.
[00:25:39.893 --> 00:25:41.514]  China to be the new lender.
[00:25:41.514 --> 00:25:44.194]  China to be the heart of the new global currency.
[00:25:44.194 --> 00:25:45.655]  The cashless SDRs.
[00:25:45.655 --> 00:25:51.837]  You'll still have your regional currencies, but it'll be set and predominantly backed by the Chinese.
[00:25:51.837 --> 00:25:54.078]  What did the Council on Foreign Relations say over a decade ago?
[00:25:54.963 --> 00:26:00.464]  That by 2010, you would see the dawn of the new Chinese century and the end of the United States.
[00:26:00.464 --> 00:26:00.684]  Why?
[00:26:00.684 --> 00:26:02.585]  Because China has one-child policies.
[00:26:02.585 --> 00:26:03.885]  They have a police state.
[00:26:03.885 --> 00:26:06.686]  They have selective private property only for the elites.
[00:26:06.686 --> 00:26:08.006]  They are the model.
[00:26:08.006 --> 00:26:09.927]  And now you see the treason.
[00:26:09.927 --> 00:26:13.748]  Oh, the answer is a global government backed by China.
[00:26:13.748 --> 00:26:16.608]  Oh, the answer, the only economy we've got is China.
[00:26:16.608 --> 00:26:17.769]  They're our savior.
[00:26:17.769 --> 00:26:22.950]  We've got, and the IMF and World Bank criticizing the United States and criticizing our debt that
[00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:26.212]  They literally engineered on record.
[00:26:26.212 --> 00:26:28.253]  They create the crisis, offer the solution.
[00:26:28.253 --> 00:26:31.074]  But the point is, we are now here at this point.
[00:26:31.074 --> 00:26:32.855]  It is now happening.
[00:26:32.855 --> 00:26:35.277]  Central banks start to abandon the U.S.
[00:26:35.277 --> 00:26:37.178]  dollar.
[00:26:37.178 --> 00:26:38.999]  I guess Gerald Solente is right on his timing.
[00:26:38.999 --> 00:26:39.919]  We knew this was coming.
[00:26:39.919 --> 00:26:44.702]  But 2010, it looks like it's going to be the year where it all gets announced.
[00:26:44.702 --> 00:26:47.484]  And 2011 and 2012 is when it gets implemented.
[00:26:47.484 --> 00:26:49.124]  And that's really all we had left was our
[00:26:50.359 --> 00:26:52.461]  Dollar being the world reserve currency.
[00:26:52.461 --> 00:26:55.444]  They could just print dollars and you could get cheap Chinese goods.
[00:26:55.444 --> 00:26:56.424]  They don't need us anymore.
[00:26:56.424 --> 00:27:00.168]  And now they've got all the increased taxes to shut down what's left of the economy.
[00:27:00.168 --> 00:27:03.871]  And if that isn't enough, each one of these a bullet to our collective heads.
[00:27:03.871 --> 00:27:14.220]  They're going to fire another buckshot 12-gauge scatter at point-blank range into our head with the carbon taxes that China, India, Mexico, and over 100 other countries don't have to implement.
[00:27:14.921 --> 00:27:17.342]  Those are global tariffs against us.
[00:27:17.342 --> 00:27:19.964]  Global taxes against us only.
[00:27:19.964 --> 00:27:21.685]  Only the West.
[00:27:21.685 --> 00:27:28.329]  Now after all our freedoms are eradicated, a few decades from now, there'll be a little industry left.
[00:27:28.329 --> 00:27:30.330]  Central banks to start abandoning the U.S.
[00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:30.850]  dollar.
[00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:34.632]  There's mounting evidence that central banks have little faith in the greenback these days.
[00:27:34.632 --> 00:27:36.773]  Can we blame them, CNN says.
[00:27:36.773 --> 00:27:38.775]  Can we blame them?
[00:27:38.775 --> 00:27:40.896]  They don't like what happened.
[00:27:40.896 --> 00:27:42.957]  They didn't engineer it.
[00:27:42.957 --> 00:27:44.378]  They're taking over right now.
[00:27:45.703 --> 00:27:47.645]  Again, they care.
[00:27:47.645 --> 00:27:48.326]  Here's another one.
[00:27:48.326 --> 00:27:56.035]  The Chinese rating agency strips Western nations of AAA status.
[00:27:56.035 --> 00:28:01.802]  The Chinese rating agency, when they own the majority of European and US debt, they're now globally
[00:28:03.422 --> 00:28:16.940]  Putting another nail in our coffin, China's leading credit rating agency has stripped America, Britain, Germany, and France of their AAA ratings and accused the Anglo-Saxon competitors of ideological bias in favor of the West.
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:18.722]  That's right, the globalists did everything they could
[00:28:19.403 --> 00:28:37.797]  To transfer our wealth there and then China gets to be nationalistic and racial and bash whitey and when it's the big central banks doing that because again, get rid of the borders of the West, fund every foreign nation bashing white people, get rid of the Western culture that gave us the Magna Carta, get rid of it at all cost.
[00:28:39.465 --> 00:28:47.052]  Promote through the media that white people are devils and are demons and that white men are scum and... Oh, it's sick.
[00:28:47.052 --> 00:28:51.697]  Crisis awaits world banks as trillions come due.
[00:28:51.697 --> 00:29:01.847]  Ah, the sovereign debt crisis would seem to create worry enough for European banks, but there's another gathering threat that has not gathered much notice.
[00:29:03.117 --> 00:29:10.762]  The trillions of dollars in short-term borrowing and institutions around the world must repay or roll over in the next two years.
[00:29:10.762 --> 00:29:12.344]  Oh.
[00:29:12.344 --> 00:29:21.810]  The European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and the International Monetary Fund have all recently warned of a looming crunch, especially in Europe, where banks have enough trouble raising money as it is.
[00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:25.833]  That means banks, they're going to bankrupt and take over.
[00:29:25.833 --> 00:29:27.034]  Oh, here's another one.
[00:29:27.034 --> 00:29:30.917]  London Telegraph, secret gold swap has spooked the market.
[00:29:32.481 --> 00:29:40.007]  Secret manipulations by the International Bank of Settlements, the OECD and others to try to drive down gold, but they failed again.
[00:29:40.007 --> 00:29:41.488]  It's spiking back up.
[00:29:41.488 --> 00:29:46.131]  We'll cover this and a lot more when we get back straight ahead.
[00:29:46.131 --> 00:29:51.575]  We're going to also detail what austerity means when you hear them promoting it.
[00:29:51.575 --> 00:29:52.996]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.996 --> 00:29:55.498]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.498 --> 00:29:58.200]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:05.513]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:05.513 --> 00:30:06.413]  Number one.
[00:30:06.413 --> 00:30:09.856]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:09.856 --> 00:30:10.716]  Number two.
[00:30:10.716 --> 00:30:15.599]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:15.599 --> 00:30:16.360]  It's true.
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:21.223]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:21.223 --> 00:30:22.043]  Number three.
[00:30:22.043 --> 00:30:25.626]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:25.626 --> 00:30:29.328]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:29.528 --> 00:30:30.328]  Number 4.
[00:30:30.328 --> 00:30:33.089]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:33.089 --> 00:30:36.770]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:37.551]  Number 5.
[00:30:37.551 --> 00:30:41.692]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:41.692 --> 00:30:46.754]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:46.754 --> 00:30:50.935]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:50.935 --> 00:30:52.715]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:30:57.737 --> 00:31:04.903]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[00:31:04.903 --> 00:31:06.165]  Tyranny is here.
[00:31:06.165 --> 00:31:09.908]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:31:09.908 --> 00:31:12.350]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:17.394]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:31:18.195 --> 00:31:24.860]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:30.844]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:31:30.844 --> 00:31:34.507]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:31:35.007 --> 00:31:39.290]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:45.254]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:31:45.254 --> 00:31:48.797]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:31:48.797 --> 00:31:50.778]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:31:50.778 --> 00:31:51.899]  It's here.

[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:31.062]  Oh, the central bankers did a bad, bad thing.
[00:33:31.062 --> 00:33:52.652]  And if we don't get the word out to the world population about what's happening, and if we don't rally humanity against this paratacism, this global Ponzi scheme that's designed to render us bankrupt and servile, then the conversion from liberty to complete despotism and human oppression
[00:33:54.278 --> 00:33:54.898]  We're good to go.
[00:34:11.769 --> 00:34:14.251]  I want to tell you about PureWaterFreedom.com.
[00:34:14.251 --> 00:34:16.392]  That's PureWaterFreedom.com.

[00:35:00.557 --> 00:35:06.343]  And you absorb 100% of this instead of just, I mean, depending on what type of vitamin I see the studies of 10, 20, 30% being absorbed.
[00:35:06.343 --> 00:35:08.365]  No, this is complete absorption.
[00:35:10.988 --> 00:35:11.228]  I think?
[00:35:34.337 --> 00:35:42.662]  1-866-762-9238, 1-866-762-9238, innerfood.com, that's E-N-E-R, food.com.
[00:35:42.662 --> 00:35:54.308]  And lastly, I've made over 20 films, and produced quite a few others, like Loose Change Final Cut, available for $5 at infowars.com, with the expanded extras.
[00:35:54.308 --> 00:36:02.392]  Of course, Jason Burness' Invisible Empire, New World Order Defined, was our latest big budget film, it's excellent, whole history of the New World Order, their drug dealing, their
[00:36:03.112 --> 00:36:09.296]  Pedophile rings, their stage terror, hundreds of quotes about world government and New World Order.

[00:37:00.902 --> 00:37:07.227]  They're even more important tools to wake up people that are finally realizing something's wrong, something's rotten, something stinks.
[00:37:07.227 --> 00:37:11.950]  This will give them a crash course in how it all ties together and you really open people's minds.
[00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:15.013]  And thirdly, it's the trifecta, as they say.
[00:37:15.013 --> 00:37:21.257]  All of your purchases of the books, videos, baseball caps, t-shirts, all of it supports this global transmission.
[00:37:21.257 --> 00:37:22.278]  We couldn't do it without you.
[00:37:22.278 --> 00:37:27.362]  So, again, InfoWars.com for all of that information.
[00:37:29.053 --> 00:37:35.878]  Let me continue now where I left off on the financial news.
[00:37:35.878 --> 00:37:41.822]  Chinese rating agency strips Western nations of AAA status.
[00:37:41.822 --> 00:37:47.847]  The Chinese are saying our countries are going bankrupt.
[00:37:47.847 --> 00:37:56.033]  And then as we lose the rating status, you heard the financial expert we had on yesterday,
[00:37:57.290 --> 00:38:08.533]  Mr. Schiff talking about how, and this is so elementary, but the average person just can't grasp it because it is so simple and diabolical, that until 1913, the U.S.
[00:38:08.533 --> 00:38:23.716]  government just issued currency, whether they be greenbacks, gold, silver, whatever it was, backed by gold and silver, but they issued the currency as just a mode of exchange, a symbol of exchange, so we don't have a barter system, so we can grease the skids of the market.
[00:38:24.858 --> 00:38:32.686]  And the bankers came in, bought off the politicians, sold it in the media that they owned, in the newspapers at the time, as something that would get the bankers.
[00:38:32.686 --> 00:38:39.593]  Because the banks had been caught running Ponzi schemes and scams and frauds and a lot of them had been arrested and the public was really mad.
[00:38:39.593 --> 00:38:44.678]  There was a big populist movement in the country with William James Bryant and
[00:38:46.303 --> 00:38:47.223]  Many others.
[00:38:47.223 --> 00:38:54.506]  And so they sold it, just like they're selling the financial reorganization plan right now, as, oh, this will punish the big bankers and Obama.
[00:38:54.506 --> 00:38:56.367]  I'm going to punish Wall Street.
[00:38:56.367 --> 00:38:58.067]  They're angry about this, let me tell you.
[00:38:58.067 --> 00:39:02.169]  The guys that financed him and financed the Republicans.
[00:39:02.169 --> 00:39:06.010]  And of course, it gives them total power over the entire economy, not just over the currency.
[00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:15.214]  And so when the Federal Reserve took over now, for a dollar to be created, a dollar of debt is owed to the private shareholders of the Federal Reserve.
[00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:20.612]  For the treasury to print a dollar, a dollar of debt is created.
[00:39:20.612 --> 00:39:23.253]  And one caller last week described it as Aladdin's lamp.
[00:39:23.253 --> 00:39:27.275]  This is like having an Aladdin's lamp with unlimited wishes.
[00:39:27.275 --> 00:39:28.955]  I wish for $10 trillion.
[00:39:28.955 --> 00:39:35.258]  And you've got less than 10 banks that are shareholders in the private Federal Reserve.
[00:39:36.963 --> 00:39:45.287]  Of course, the Bank of England is also a shareholder, and there's been a few congressional hearings on that more than 50 years ago, and that's the last time we found out who held shares in it.
[00:39:45.287 --> 00:39:49.770]  But it's Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo.
[00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:56.253]  These are the names you know, but those themselves are just commercial bank and brokerage bank and investment bank fronts for these families.
[00:39:57.987 --> 00:40:05.389]  An example of that is what, three years ago, Rex Tillerson was threatened with being removed as the chairman of ExxonMobil by David Rockefeller.
[00:40:05.389 --> 00:40:11.830]  And it came out in the news that he showed up at the shareholder meeting and said, you know I'm still the owner of the majority of shares?
[00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:13.450]  You will all be fired right now.
[00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:16.591]  This board will be fired if you don't come out with a carbon tax.
[00:40:16.591 --> 00:40:21.252]  Two days later, they came out with a carbon tax and said, ExxonMobil endorses global carbon taxes.
[00:40:21.949 --> 00:40:24.771]  And we want attacks on Wellhead and at Gas Pump.
[00:40:24.771 --> 00:40:26.113]  We want whatever you want.
[00:40:26.113 --> 00:40:27.774]  Rex Tillerson said, yes sir, boss.
[00:40:27.774 --> 00:40:30.997]  In fact, search engine that.
[00:40:30.997 --> 00:40:33.599]  David Rockefeller goes to Exxon Mobil.
[00:40:33.599 --> 00:40:35.921]  Let's just show people how they can document all of this.
[00:40:35.921 --> 00:40:41.305]  People watch these videos on PrisonPlanet.tv and YouTube and I see their comments going, this guy's just making this stuff up.
[00:40:41.305 --> 00:40:45.709]  There's no way somebody could just have this memory and be here just rattling all this off.
[00:40:45.709 --> 00:40:46.750]  Really, I'm not that smart.
[00:40:48.001 --> 00:40:52.205]  I mean, you can rattle off baseball scores from 35 years ago.
[00:40:52.205 --> 00:40:55.709]  You can rattle off football scores from three or four Super Bowls ago.
[00:40:55.709 --> 00:41:01.495]  You remember the play, you know, when the Titans and the Rams or whatever were playing, and the Titans won in overtime.
[00:41:01.495 --> 00:41:04.358]  So do I. I mean, come on, don't give me that.
[00:41:05.219 --> 00:41:09.381]  You remember Roger Stahlbeck at a Super Bowl running it in in the last five seconds.
[00:41:09.381 --> 00:41:19.106]  I mean, don't tell me you can't start remembering serious things and become as focused on real issues as you are on football and baseball and basketball and Lindsay Lohan.
[00:41:19.106 --> 00:41:23.028]  The search engine Rockefeller.
[00:41:23.028 --> 00:41:25.930]  Rockefeller, I remember the exact headlines like three years ago.
[00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:31.353]  Rockefeller goes to Exxon Mobil shareholders meeting.
[00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:35.992]  Demands they change view on global warming.
[00:41:35.992 --> 00:41:37.772]  The headline was something like that.
[00:41:37.772 --> 00:41:40.914]  And you can see who really owns all of this.
[00:41:40.914 --> 00:41:47.017]  Okay, it's less than 10 families that pretty much dominate the U.S., less than 15 or so worldwide.
[00:41:47.017 --> 00:41:48.458]  And this is how they operate.
[00:41:48.458 --> 00:41:51.479]  You know, it's the Lee families run China for 500 years and they still run it.
[00:41:51.479 --> 00:41:53.781]  All right, let's continue here.
[00:41:55.023 --> 00:41:59.305]  Chinese rating agency strips Western nations of AAA status.
[00:41:59.305 --> 00:42:11.812]  China's lending credit rating agency has stripped America, Britain, Germany, and France of AAA rating, accusing Anglo-Saxon competitors, they're not competitors, they're globalists, teamed up with you, of ideological bias in favor of the West.
[00:42:11.812 --> 00:42:18.455]  And of course that works well with the Chinese public hyping them up to rally around their corrupt government because their government bashes the West.
[00:42:18.455 --> 00:42:23.618]  It's now declassified as of about a decade ago, and it's even on the History Channel, I can't believe they admit it.
[00:42:24.458 --> 00:42:30.660]  The CIA actually double-crossed Chiang Kai-shek in 1949 and put Mao Zedong into power.
[00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:31.980]  There was never a split.
[00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:35.241]  The United States was allied with China in World War II against Japan.
[00:42:35.241 --> 00:42:43.163]  The United States, for a full year before Pearl Harbor, had Marines, aviators, Army aviators, and others in a private cohort
[00:42:43.683 --> 00:42:47.745]  With hundreds of aircraft of Flying Tigers and other groups attacking the Japanese.
[00:42:47.745 --> 00:42:49.125]  I'm not defending the Imperial Japanese.
[00:42:49.125 --> 00:42:51.887]  The point is, the Japanese said this is an act of war.
[00:42:51.887 --> 00:42:52.287]  The U.S.
[00:42:52.287 --> 00:42:55.728]  knew they were going to attack Pearl Harbor and ordered them to stand down.
[00:42:55.728 --> 00:42:57.129]  You guys didn't find the David Rockefeller thing?
[00:43:01.121 --> 00:43:05.762]  You know mastermind Watson will be able to, you guys are the best, but even when I can't find something, Watson can.
[00:43:05.762 --> 00:43:12.084]  Rockefeller seek change at Exxon, New York Times, here it is, 2008, so you did find one.
[00:43:12.084 --> 00:43:14.425]  Good job, there it is, you found it.
[00:43:14.425 --> 00:43:17.265]  Let's pull up something for them because they won't believe me about Pearl Harbor.
[00:43:17.265 --> 00:43:25.828]  It was in the Honolulu Advertiser a week before that the Japanese would attack on the morning of December 7th.
[00:43:27.469 --> 00:43:33.491]  And everybody knew, and the generals and admirals tried to warn people and were told to stand down and let it happen, and that's been declassified.
[00:43:33.491 --> 00:43:35.791]  The purple and blue code have been broken, and they knew.
[00:43:35.791 --> 00:43:46.074]  In fact, just search engine the term Honolulu Advertiser, Japanese to strike Pearl Harbor, and you'll see a scan of the full Honolulu Advertiser.
[00:43:46.074 --> 00:43:46.974]  Let's just show them right now.
[00:43:47.705 --> 00:43:53.870]  Let's just show them right now how they can discover all of this for themselves and stop being so ignorant.
[00:43:53.870 --> 00:44:01.015]  We can pull up the San Diego newspaper about the Gulf of Tonkin being staged in 1964, when the sailors got back and some of the officers said it was staged.
[00:44:01.015 --> 00:44:02.036]  Of course, now it's declassified.
[00:44:02.036 --> 00:44:13.865]  I mean, what's it going to take, ladies and gentlemen, for you to realize the truth about all of this, that four midget submarines attacked Pearl Harbor that morning and the ships were still ordered to stand down?
[00:44:13.865 --> 00:44:14.846]  That's been declassified.
[00:44:17.503 --> 00:44:20.584]  To be technical, two attacked the harbor, two attacked other areas.
[00:44:20.584 --> 00:44:25.404]  Well, one attacked another area, another got beached, and that was several hours before, but you can pull that up.
[00:44:25.404 --> 00:44:29.645]  That's actually CNN headline, U.S.
[00:44:29.645 --> 00:44:32.166]  attack Japan at Pearl Harbor first.
[00:44:32.166 --> 00:44:34.786]  That's actually in my film, Masters of Terror.
[00:44:34.786 --> 00:44:35.846]  But I digress, I'm sorry.
[00:44:35.846 --> 00:44:42.107]  I've got all these stacks of news I promised to get to first before I go to your calls, and we got into stack number three.
[00:44:42.107 --> 00:44:43.608]  There it is.
[00:44:43.608 --> 00:44:45.388]  There is the Honolulu advertiser.
[00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:51.082]  And he says, Japanese may strike over weekend.
[00:44:51.082 --> 00:44:55.825]  And then you read it and they give the exact morning and date and everything, because good people inside the cub breaking.
[00:44:55.825 --> 00:45:02.468]  And Washington refused to go along with Roosevelt and Churchill and actually warned intelligence officers there at the base.
[00:45:02.468 --> 00:45:05.390]  And their radar picked it up, they were ordered to stand down as well.
[00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:09.552]  They were told it was a group of bombers coming in, US bombers.
[00:45:09.552 --> 00:45:11.773]  Okay.
[00:45:11.773 --> 00:45:15.595]  Continuing, crisis awaits world
[00:45:16.943 --> 00:45:24.830]  Banks, as trillions come due, and they admit that's about to kick off something bigger than October 2008 crash.
[00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:28.773]  Here's a secret gold swap has spooked the market.
[00:45:28.773 --> 00:45:43.747]  It takes a lot to spook the solid old gold market, but when it emerged last week that one of more banks had lent 380 tons of gold to the Bank of International Settlements in return for foreign currencies, there was widespread surprise and confusion.
[00:45:44.847 --> 00:45:45.948]  Again, the banks do this.
[00:45:45.948 --> 00:45:52.892]  They manipulate and sell gold back and forth at lower prices, and that's come out in congressional hearings to artificially drive it down.
[00:45:52.892 --> 00:46:02.317]  This is how we've known for 15 years, at least I've known for 15 years, and GATT has known for close to a decade since their founding, how all this is done, the Gold Antitrust Action Committee.
[00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:06.122]  And so here it is in the news, how they manipulate it.
[00:46:06.122 --> 00:46:09.925]  But the media spins this the other way, like, oh, gold should then go down.
[00:46:09.925 --> 00:46:12.527]  Well, gold's actually up 16 bucks today.
[00:46:12.527 --> 00:46:23.796]  The news that the mystery bank has just pawned the family jewels gave traders a jolt, nervous about the sudden transfer of almost 20% of the world's annual gold production and the possibility of a sell-off.
[00:46:23.796 --> 00:46:27.600]  So they're trying to put out this rumor that there's about to be a popping of the gold bubble.
[00:46:28.701 --> 00:46:36.087]  How can that happen in gold and silver when, at inflation numbers for 1980, it should be $2,500 an ounce or more?
[00:46:36.087 --> 00:46:51.801]  So they could do this short-term, but not long-term, because they're devaluing currencies worldwide, and dollars and yen and yen and euros are being devalued, and so gold is denominated in those currencies, and so it's going to go up.
[00:46:51.801 --> 00:46:53.322]  Gold's not really going up.
[00:46:53.322 --> 00:46:55.064]  The currencies are losing value.
[00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:58.631]  So that's how they spin this.
[00:46:58.631 --> 00:47:05.953]  And a tiny footnote in its annual report, the bank disclosed its unusually large holding of gold compared with nothing the year before.
[00:47:05.953 --> 00:47:09.794]  The disclosure was a large factor in the correction of gold price this week.
[00:47:09.794 --> 00:47:13.995]  Well, this is the bank hoarding gold and buying it out from another group.
[00:47:13.995 --> 00:47:15.735]  So that should actually send gold up.
[00:47:15.735 --> 00:47:18.216]  Boy, I tell you, they can really make lemons out of lemonade, can't they?
[00:47:18.216 --> 00:47:21.977]  And the average dumbed-down person reads that and buys it.
[00:47:21.977 --> 00:47:25.138]  Republicans sound warning over expiration of Bush tax cuts.
[00:47:26.343 --> 00:47:39.651]  With the economy still sputtering, Republicans are drawing renewed attention to the looming expiration of Bush-era tax cuts and warn that the roadblock will clobber everyone from small business owners to middle-class families.
[00:47:39.651 --> 00:47:53.659]  With the economy still sputtering, Republicans are drawing renewed attention to the looming expiration of Bush-era tax cuts and warning that the roadblock will clobber everyone from small business owners to middle-class families.
[00:47:54.912 --> 00:47:55.052]  Yes.
[00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:24.442]  And I talk about this all the time, but Kennedy in one tax bracket cut it by 35%, another by 40, and another by 50.
[00:48:24.442 --> 00:48:28.424]  In some of the lowest brackets, he cut it by 50.
[00:48:28.424 --> 00:48:33.466]  And tax receipts more than doubled in one year after his 1961 tax cut.
[00:48:33.466 --> 00:48:36.668]  I mean, Kennedy was a patriot.
[00:48:36.668 --> 00:48:44.291]  He wasn't perfect, but he went and his advisors and pointed out, well, sir, when we cut taxes, the economy surges.
[00:48:44.291 --> 00:48:46.172]  And he said, well, cut them, cut them as much as you can.
[00:48:47.125 --> 00:48:49.166]  I mean, especially if the government gets more money.
[00:48:49.166 --> 00:48:52.629]  The government doesn't want more tax receipts.
[00:48:52.629 --> 00:48:54.870]  They want to bankrupt the economy.
[00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:57.372]  They want to drive you out of your cars into buses.
[00:48:57.372 --> 00:48:59.453]  They want to bankrupt you off the road.
[00:48:59.453 --> 00:49:03.236]  They want to bankrupt you so you can't send your children to private school.
[00:49:03.236 --> 00:49:07.339]  They want to bankrupt you and shut down all energy supplies in the United States.
[00:49:07.339 --> 00:49:13.283]  This is an act of war, the carbon tax, now being implemented, even though they can't get the Senate to pass it, through the EPA and others.
[00:49:14.875 --> 00:49:16.116]  They want you to go bankrupt.
[00:49:16.116 --> 00:49:19.719]  California knew in the last two years when they raised all those taxes.
[00:49:19.719 --> 00:49:27.205]  California knew full well that when they did that the economy would go from sputtering to full cardiac arrest.
[00:49:27.205 --> 00:49:28.226]  A total stallout.
[00:49:28.226 --> 00:49:29.447]  The engine blew.
[00:49:29.447 --> 00:49:36.413]  Schwarzenegger's up there stealing and grabbing and insider trading and he worked with Enron on scamming people.
[00:49:36.413 --> 00:49:37.453]  I mean he is just in there
[00:49:38.174 --> 00:49:42.218]  Well, when he got in, he was worth something like $800 million, and now he's supposedly worth like $2 million.
[00:49:42.218 --> 00:49:47.243]  I mean, he's in there as governor, just raping everyone, laughing at everyone.
[00:49:47.243 --> 00:49:51.867]  There's all these quotes about how he loves to abuse and con people and manipulate them.
[00:49:51.867 --> 00:49:53.589]  California's raised all these taxes.
[00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:55.591]  Michigan's raising taxes.
[00:49:55.591 --> 00:49:57.553]  You've got New York raising taxes.
[00:49:57.553 --> 00:49:59.194]  In fact, they passed 80-plus taxes.
[00:50:00.015 --> 00:50:01.415]  In the last couple years.
[00:50:01.415 --> 00:50:03.596]  I saw that headline in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:50:03.596 --> 00:50:05.816]  And it was 84, 86 taxes.
[00:50:05.816 --> 00:50:08.077]  And it's just imploding.
[00:50:08.077 --> 00:50:09.957]  The middle class is moving out.
[00:50:09.957 --> 00:50:11.778]  The third world populations are moving in.
[00:50:11.778 --> 00:50:13.578]  They immediately are given welfare.
[00:50:13.578 --> 00:50:15.639]  Because the system is in an economic takeover.
[00:50:15.639 --> 00:50:17.099]  They want it bankrupt.
[00:50:17.099 --> 00:50:22.100]  After things are bankrupt, they're going to cut all the services to the poor people.
[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:25.421]  They're going to slash those, except for Planned Parenthood and sterilization and things.
[00:50:26.361 --> 00:50:35.068]  Uh, they're gonna slash that after they've got all the third world people here, after they can be then used as a political weapon to say, you want half of what you used to get?
[00:50:35.068 --> 00:50:38.031]  Vote to rob that tiny middle class that's left.
[00:50:38.031 --> 00:50:42.515]  Then they'll vote to rob them, vote to take their guns, and then the globals will say, now you get even less.
[00:50:45.259 --> 00:50:47.582]  It's just so diabolical.
[00:50:47.582 --> 00:50:48.923]  I'll get more into the economy later.
[00:50:48.923 --> 00:50:52.687]  We're going to come back, take calls for the next 30 minutes or so.
[00:50:52.687 --> 00:50:55.551]  Then I'm going to get into a ton of news.
[00:50:55.551 --> 00:50:59.275]  But first I want to get into CNN saying people being murdered is good.
[00:50:59.275 --> 00:50:59.835]  I'm not kidding.
[00:50:59.835 --> 00:51:00.797]  You can't make this stuff up.
[00:51:02.113 --> 00:51:06.714]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:52:03.189 --> 00:52:06.173]  We are part of a new world order.
[00:52:06.173 --> 00:52:09.497]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[00:52:09.497 --> 00:52:14.603]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:14.603 --> 00:52:18.808]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:19.108 --> 00:52:21.449]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:21.449 --> 00:52:24.331]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:24.331 --> 00:52:27.253]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:27.253 --> 00:52:34.857]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:35.191 --> 00:52:40.575]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:40.575 --> 00:52:42.897]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:42.897 --> 00:52:47.120]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:48.201]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:48.201 --> 00:52:49.542]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:49.542 --> 00:52:51.023]  Invisible Empire.

[00:53:04.136 --> 00:53:06.639]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:53:06.639 --> 00:53:08.540]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:15.767]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.

[00:54:17.843 --> 00:54:21.469]  Post them on your Facebook, Myspace, YouTube, you name it.
[00:54:21.469 --> 00:54:24.734]  CNN, Sanchez, dead Americans, good for war.
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:28.480]  I think?
[00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:00.862]  We're good to go.
[00:55:12.008 --> 00:55:19.274]  This host talking about the Uganda attacks that killed more than 70 people and four separate bombings.
[00:55:19.274 --> 00:55:20.615]  Will he apologize?
[00:55:20.615 --> 00:55:27.920]  He was talking to a CIA officer and he said, well, you've got to admit, you know, this helps show how evil the Muslims are.
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:30.262]  And my issue is there are some Muslim terror attacks.
[00:55:30.262 --> 00:55:33.445]  There are some Muslim terrorists, but most of it is either purely staged.
[00:55:34.384 --> 00:55:38.788]  Or intelligence agencies finance other terror groups to carry out attacks.
[00:55:38.788 --> 00:55:41.310]  I mean, Israel admits they founded Hamas.
[00:55:41.310 --> 00:55:45.534]  That's Haaretz and Jerusalem Post as a counterbalance to the PLO.
[00:55:45.534 --> 00:55:49.918]  Remember we told you two years ago the Mumbai attacks were a government op run by the CIA?
[00:55:49.918 --> 00:55:52.860]  And because the head of Indian intelligence said that, then they assassinated him?
[00:55:53.681 --> 00:55:58.205]  And then it turned out that a, quote, US government agent with the CIA commanded the attacks.
[00:55:58.205 --> 00:55:59.906]  That was the Chicago Tribune.
[00:55:59.906 --> 00:56:01.267]  That just came out, what, two months ago?
[00:56:01.267 --> 00:56:05.010]  I mean, these articles detail this whole history.
[00:56:05.010 --> 00:56:08.313]  And I have to tell you, this is very suspicious what happened in Uganda.
[00:56:09.173 --> 00:56:12.315]  And they're trying to move AFRICOM in there and have the U.S.
[00:56:12.315 --> 00:56:13.676]  military occupy it.
[00:56:13.676 --> 00:56:15.738]  They have SOUTHCOM, NORTHCOM, CENTCOM.
[00:56:15.738 --> 00:56:17.960]  Now they want AFRICOM, AFRICOR.
[00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:23.984]  Let's go ahead and go to this incredible clip where he first pulls on your heartstrings talking about an aid worker who was killed.
[00:56:23.984 --> 00:56:30.749]  And then he segues into, well this is a good thing, talking to the CIA officer.
[00:56:30.749 --> 00:56:31.750]  This is outrageous.
[00:56:39.068 --> 00:56:40.549]  I want to tell you a story now.
[00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:41.270]  Welcome back.
[00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:42.130]  I'm Rick Sanchez.
[00:56:42.130 --> 00:56:43.011]  This is Rick's List.
[00:56:43.011 --> 00:56:45.893]  This is a story about a guy named Nate Henn.
[00:56:45.893 --> 00:56:46.734]  This is important.
[00:56:46.734 --> 00:56:48.015]  Stay with me here.
[00:56:48.015 --> 00:56:51.938]  By all accounts, American Nate Henn was a hell of a guy.
[00:56:51.938 --> 00:56:56.722]  This is a selfless individual who devoted his young life to helping others.
[00:56:56.722 --> 00:56:58.623]  Today, he's dead.
[00:56:58.623 --> 00:57:00.265]  Nate Henn is dead.
[00:57:01.391 --> 00:57:07.996]  Killed by murderous terrorists in the faraway land of Uganda, where Hen was working with children.
[00:57:07.996 --> 00:57:12.939]  Thousands of people had gathered in Uganda's capital to watch the final game of the World Cup.
[00:57:12.939 --> 00:57:14.881]  They're watching a soccer game.
[00:57:14.881 --> 00:57:18.624]  The game was in its 19th minute when the bombs began to explode.
[00:57:18.624 --> 00:57:25.268]  One at a restaurant, then two at a rugby field where they were watching on an outdoor screen.
[00:57:25.268 --> 00:57:27.710]  Our latest tally of the number who died, 74.
[00:57:29.951 --> 00:57:32.192]  74 innocent people are dead.
[00:57:32.192 --> 00:57:35.314]  Joining me now is Gary Bernstein.
[00:57:35.314 --> 00:57:37.154]  He's a former CIA officer.
[00:57:37.154 --> 00:57:38.615]  But you know what's interesting about this?
[00:57:38.615 --> 00:57:52.120]  In a strange way, the event is helpful to the cause of those of us who know how sadistic these fundamental radical Islamic terrorists are.
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:58.063]  And if it helps get the message out there that these are not the good guys, then so be it.
[00:57:59.130 --> 00:58:00.591]  Then so be it.
[00:58:00.591 --> 00:58:15.216]  Now, this is a big, big issue, and you can go read all these other reporters and analysts and Pentagon people saying, oh, we sure need another 9-11 to teach the lazy, bad American people that we need to attack Iran, that we need to go into other countries.
[00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:26.042]  And then, of course, it came out not just in Mumbai that it was a government operation run by the West, but remember it came out in mainstream news that the Bali operation was an inside job.
[00:58:26.042 --> 00:58:28.183]  I mean, they do this over and over again.
[00:58:28.183 --> 00:58:29.643]  This is just a fact.
[00:58:29.643 --> 00:58:31.004]  This is just a fact.
[00:58:31.004 --> 00:58:31.724]  It's like the U.S.'
[00:58:31.664 --> 00:58:35.205]  's liberty was staged to be blamed on Egypt.
[00:58:35.205 --> 00:58:37.305]  Even a BBC documentary found that.
[00:58:37.305 --> 00:58:39.386]  It was called Operation Cyanide.
[00:58:39.386 --> 00:58:39.966]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:43.490 --> 00:58:46.116]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:59:54.218 --> 00:59:56.619]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.619 --> 01:00:06.265]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:06.265 --> 01:00:07.586]  Big Brother.
[01:00:07.586 --> 01:00:09.347]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:09.347 --> 01:00:11.088]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:11.088 --> 01:00:12.689]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.689 --> 01:00:14.230]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:18.432]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.432 --> 01:00:22.475]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.026 --> 01:00:30.851]  Well, if you just joined us, CNN host calls deadly terror bombings helpful to the New World Order agenda.
[01:00:30.851 --> 01:00:31.611]  That's PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:00:31.611 --> 01:00:34.894]  We're going to play that again later in the hour.
[01:00:34.894 --> 01:00:44.041]  CNN Sanchez says that America's good for war against manufactured terror, that it's helpful, and that so be it if it helps understand how evil the Muslims are.
[01:00:44.041 --> 01:00:47.324]  A key article, I'll be detailing more coming up.
[01:00:47.324 --> 01:00:51.447]  I also want to get into FDA panel to review safety of diabetes drug, Vandia.
[01:00:52.568 --> 01:01:01.057]  Another big European report that aspartame is causing miscarriages and low birth weights and a bunch of other genetic engineering poisoning eugenics news.
[01:01:01.057 --> 01:01:02.959]  That is all coming up.
[01:01:02.959 --> 01:01:07.703]  But I want to go to your phone calls as well here today.
[01:01:08.829 --> 01:01:14.331]  After I take calls here in the next 20 minutes, I'm also going to get into, suffer these criminals in Oakland.
[01:01:14.331 --> 01:01:15.332]  Don't call the cops.
[01:01:15.332 --> 01:01:18.833]  Dozens of layoffs, effective at midnight, barring last minute deal.
[01:01:18.833 --> 01:01:21.214]  The police are saying they're not going to respond to petty crime.
[01:01:21.214 --> 01:01:23.135]  That's actually been going on for a long time.
[01:01:23.135 --> 01:01:24.375]  Now it's just official.
[01:01:24.375 --> 01:01:28.597]  And I wanted to dovetail that with Cleveland, Ohio, a suburb.
[01:01:28.597 --> 01:01:32.558]  And it talks about counties there saying, buy guns, we can't protect you.
[01:01:32.558 --> 01:01:33.518]  At least they're being honest.
[01:01:33.518 --> 01:01:35.759]  So that's coming up as well.
[01:01:35.759 --> 01:01:37.160]  Also the latest on the oil spill.
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:39.120]  Hey, well, thank you, Alex.
[01:02:06.664 --> 01:02:15.527]  I was looking at some of the good things you've done here and I know you had Red Beckman on your program before.
[01:02:15.527 --> 01:02:24.910]  I had several things today and at first I wanted to challenge you, Alex, to get him back on there again if possible.
[01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:29.112]  In Beckman's Born Again Republic book, pages 133-136, is he talking about
[01:02:32.826 --> 01:02:40.151]  A will and testament left to us here in 2010 by the signers of the Constitution.
[01:02:40.151 --> 01:02:44.935]  I remember one of the signers was asked, um, what is this?
[01:02:44.935 --> 01:02:46.836]  It's a republic, madam, if you can keep it.
[01:02:48.194 --> 01:03:00.240]  Yeah, yeah, it said, and he replied, it will, yeah, in context, he exactly, it will be good only when we, the people, will be as serious about it as those who have signed it are.
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:02.762]  Yeah, freedom is not a spectator sport.
[01:03:02.762 --> 01:03:05.683]  You better be involved 110% or you're going to be enslaved.
[01:03:05.683 --> 01:03:07.544]  Mark, I appreciate your call.
[01:03:07.544 --> 01:03:09.005]  Nathan in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:03:09.005 --> 01:03:11.626]  Hello?
[01:03:11.626 --> 01:03:12.046]  Yes, sir.
[01:03:12.046 --> 01:03:14.988]  Well, it's good to talk to you, sir.
[01:03:16.308 --> 01:03:20.192]  I'm assuming you've read David Rockefeller's book, Memoirs?
[01:03:20.192 --> 01:03:24.335]  Yes, where he says, I am guilty of wanting to set up a world government to abridge U.S.
[01:03:24.335 --> 01:03:24.815]  sovereignty.
[01:03:24.815 --> 01:03:27.978]  He says that's what I'm accused of, and I say guilty as charged.
[01:03:27.978 --> 01:03:29.419]  Absolutely.
[01:03:29.419 --> 01:03:37.586]  Since he has written this book, and I mean, it's in his own words and everything, I'm wondering what can we do to possibly
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:42.441]  Um, arrest him and try him for, uh, high treason.
[01:03:42.441 --> 01:03:45.501]  Well, you've got to educate the public that what high treason is.
[01:03:45.501 --> 01:03:52.863]  Obama blocking Arizona and saying, I want the crime to continue, to hold people hostage, to pass global amnesty for the North American Union.
[01:03:52.863 --> 01:03:54.163]  That's an act of treason.
[01:03:54.163 --> 01:03:56.224]  And you've got to educate people about what treason is.
[01:03:56.224 --> 01:04:07.906]  I mean, the average person doesn't know that there's literally thousands of books, thousands of white papers written by every prominent globalist about how they're poisoning our water and our food and setting up world government and Kim trailing the skies and it's all admitted.
[01:04:08.746 --> 01:04:15.970]  I mean, I have thousands, no exaggeration, thousands of documents admitting they're chemtrailing, poisoning the food, GMOing.
[01:04:15.970 --> 01:04:18.131]  I mean, I am wallowing in evidence.
[01:04:18.131 --> 01:04:30.677]  And I'm just here trying to present it to people and saying, hey, instead of knowing all about LeBron James, who has the Chosen One tattooed on his back and likens himself to King James, you know, of the King James Version, he's some type of god or demigod.
[01:04:30.677 --> 01:04:35.679]  How about we become informed about how there's total tyranny unfolding?
[01:04:37.426 --> 01:04:45.735]  Well, I'm no lawyer, so I'm just wondering, is there any way to get those cops involved and actually arrest this guy and start a trial?
[01:04:45.735 --> 01:04:47.556]  Well, that's something grand juries could do.
[01:04:47.556 --> 01:04:54.323]  I mean, you've got somebody who's in control of much of the government, who engineered the banking collapse, saying he wants to destroy America.
[01:04:54.323 --> 01:04:59.008]  And so, again, I'm here nailing it to the church door, nailing the facts up.
[01:04:59.008 --> 01:04:59.629]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:01.567 --> 01:05:05.671]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[01:06:01.121 --> 01:06:03.524]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:06:03.524 --> 01:06:05.727]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:06:05.727 --> 01:06:09.051]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:06:09.051 --> 01:06:14.158]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:06:14.158 --> 01:06:18.344]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:06:18.664 --> 01:06:21.006]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:06:21.006 --> 01:06:23.547]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:06:23.547 --> 01:06:26.809]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:06:26.809 --> 01:06:34.394]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:06:34.747 --> 01:06:40.132]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:06:40.132 --> 01:06:42.975]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:06:42.975 --> 01:06:46.679]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:06:46.679 --> 01:06:47.740]  And I got news for you.
[01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:49.081]  You're everyone else.
[01:06:49.081 --> 01:06:50.582]  Invisible Empire.

[01:08:03.214 --> 01:08:07.064]  From his Central to the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:08:07.064 --> 01:08:09.249]  And the heart of the resistance.
[01:08:09.249 --> 01:08:11.795]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:08:34.272 --> 01:08:38.933]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are now into the second hour, eight minutes in here.
[01:08:38.933 --> 01:08:42.034]  I'm going to be breaking down the economy more at the bottom of the hour.
[01:08:42.034 --> 01:08:47.015]  I'm also going to get into Fidel Castro is now saying that he thinks World War III is about to begin.
[01:08:47.015 --> 01:08:49.075]  I'm going to go over some of his quotes there.
[01:08:49.075 --> 01:08:55.436]  An Iraq inquiry says the government intentionally and substantively exaggerated WMD threat.
[01:08:55.436 --> 01:08:57.637]  We already know that, but it's amazing to see the British government
[01:08:58.277 --> 01:08:58.738]  I think so.
[01:09:20.535 --> 01:09:26.588]  The arrest and intimidation are continuing, so we'll be discussing some of that coming up.
[01:09:26.588 --> 01:09:29.194]  And all over the United States, very ominous developments.
[01:09:30.995 --> 01:09:42.805]  As CNN and others report that the United States has lost its AAA rating as a nation, so has Europe to the Communist Chinese.
[01:09:42.805 --> 01:09:43.826]  People say, well, then who cares?
[01:09:43.826 --> 01:09:45.648]  Well, they're our biggest creditor.
[01:09:45.648 --> 01:09:48.010]  They buy this worthless paper.
[01:09:48.010 --> 01:09:56.156]  And now from California to Iowa and many other areas, they are reporting that police will not respond to normal crime.
[01:09:56.937 --> 01:09:58.058]  Hey Alex, great to talk to you again.
[01:09:58.058 --> 01:10:00.219]  I just wanted to make a suggestion.
[01:10:00.219 --> 01:10:03.641]  I've been befriending people all around the globe on Facebook.
[01:10:19.551 --> 01:10:19.991]  I don't think so.
[01:10:40.066 --> 01:10:43.548]  Well, they just said there's been a new development 30 seconds before I walked in.
[01:10:43.548 --> 01:10:47.530]  I saw a Reuters article that Phil tried to tell me about.
[01:10:47.530 --> 01:10:54.034]  And so I don't have the latest on that, but we will cover that for you coming up as soon as I'm able to research it.
[01:10:54.034 --> 01:10:56.395]  What's your take, Nathan?
[01:10:56.395 --> 01:10:59.897]  Oh, I just think as far as that goes, I mean, I just I didn't know what to think of it.
[01:10:59.897 --> 01:11:03.880]  I saw that there was a few different videos that had come out saying that he was here studying.
[01:11:04.744 --> 01:11:05.505]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:11:17.791 --> 01:11:30.814]  Iran has nuclear scientists over here, so there's a possibility of a, you know, staged Iranian attack, you know, to line up with all of what's going on with, you know, us, you know, getting ready for war with Iran.
[01:11:30.814 --> 01:11:32.374]  Well, they did that in 2002.
[01:11:32.374 --> 01:11:44.857]  In 2003, they would claim that Iraqi defectors had told them one thing, and then later the defectors came out and said that they hadn't said that, and strangely enough, in Jordan and Iraq, they would then be hunted down and killed mysteriously by al-Qaeda.
[01:11:44.857 --> 01:11:46.137]  Why would al-Qaeda
[01:11:46.937 --> 01:11:57.401]  Here is the headline out of Reuters, Iran scientist turns up at Washington mission.
[01:12:16.969 --> 01:12:30.354]  A missing Iranian nuclear scientist dramatically turned up at an Iranian interest section of Pakistan's embassy in Washington and was quoted as saying he was kidnapped by the U.S.
[01:12:30.354 --> 01:12:32.935]  agents in a disgraceful act.
[01:12:32.935 --> 01:12:33.596]  But a U.S.
[01:12:33.596 --> 01:12:45.881]  official who declined to be named said that the scientist who vanished during a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia more than a year ago had been visiting the United States and had decided to return to Iran of his own free will.
[01:12:46.701 --> 01:12:57.463]  Tehran has reportedly accused the CIA of abducting him, who worked for Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, but ABC News has reported he defected and was helping the agency.
[01:12:57.463 --> 01:13:01.624]  Washington denied he was spirited away for nuclear secrets.
[01:13:01.624 --> 01:13:04.324]  My kidnapping was a disgraceful act for America.
[01:13:04.324 --> 01:13:09.265]  I was under enormous psychological pressure and supervision of armed guards in the past 14 months.
[01:13:09.265 --> 01:13:14.366]  Amiri, who is in his 30s, was quoted as saying in a phone interview with Iran's state TV.
[01:13:15.146 --> 01:13:26.392]  Iran is locked in a dispute with the United States and its allies over Tehran's nuclear development program that the West says is designed to produce nuclear weapons and which Iran officially says aims to generate power.
[01:13:28.049 --> 01:13:30.131]  There's another development hot off the presses.
[01:13:30.131 --> 01:13:32.713]  Iranian scientists came freely to U.S.
[01:13:32.713 --> 01:13:34.314]  officials now say.
[01:13:34.314 --> 01:13:40.439]  So was he really kidnapped or is he trying to cover up his defection back to Iran?
[01:13:40.439 --> 01:13:42.481]  Who knows, my friends.
[01:13:42.481 --> 01:13:47.104]  But your point about how they're trying to hype up war with Iran is well taken.
[01:13:47.104 --> 01:13:48.786]  Here is Press TV, which is a
[01:13:49.486 --> 01:13:52.490]  English-speaking version of Iranian state television.
[01:13:52.490 --> 01:14:00.558]  It's basically like Al Jazeera is to Saudi Arabia.
[01:14:00.558 --> 01:14:01.680]  By the way, Ron Paul agrees.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:05.324]  I mean, if somebody came and blocked goods and services coming into the U.S.
[01:14:05.324 --> 01:14:07.967]  with warships and was grabbing U.S.
[01:14:07.967 --> 01:14:09.729]  bank accounts worldwide, that'd be an act of war.
[01:14:10.249 --> 01:14:18.457]  A senior Iranian lawmaker says the new round of anti-Iran UN Security Council sanctions is an open declaration of war against Iran by these six major powers.
[01:14:18.457 --> 01:14:28.446]  Speaking to the Fars News Agency on Sunday, a member of Iran's Parliament's Foreign Policy and National Security Commission, Mohammad Karim Raad, said the administration of the U.S.
[01:14:28.446 --> 01:14:28.687]  President
[01:14:29.744 --> 01:14:32.766]  Never truly after a nuclear fuel exchange with Iran.
[01:14:32.766 --> 01:14:43.551]  Yeah, they offered to give all their nuclear fuel to the UN to be enriched in Brazil, or in Turkey, or in France, so they'd 100% know it couldn't be used for weapons, and they said no!
[01:14:43.551 --> 01:14:45.732]  Five years ago, before they put Ahmadinejad in.
[01:14:45.732 --> 01:14:46.713]  They were very soft.
[01:14:47.593 --> 01:15:01.723]  The opposite of hardline and we're letting inspectors in everywhere and then the UN said you can't even have peaceful reactors now They're trying to put sanctions on to block fuel being imported because Iran has a lot of oil, but they Refineries are very expensive and very complex.
[01:15:01.723 --> 01:15:13.292]  They can only refine about half the fuel they need so they want reactors for power and They're growing population President Obama did not expect Iran to accept the exchange of
[01:15:14.181 --> 01:15:19.386]  It's 3.5% enriched uranium with 20% enriched batched outside of Iranian soil, he went on to say.
[01:15:19.386 --> 01:15:23.169]  But see, that's too complex for the average person to actually research and figure out.
[01:15:23.169 --> 01:15:30.195]  They're too busy knowing all of the trivia about Lindsay Lohan or Michael Jordan or any of these people.
[01:15:30.195 --> 01:15:31.536]  They're just too busy.
[01:15:31.536 --> 01:15:38.903]  They know all about Paris Hilton and her sex tape, but they know nothing about what's happened in Iran's history with the United States.
[01:15:40.012 --> 01:15:43.594]  And continuing, Iran-backed group eyed attack on U.S.
[01:15:43.594 --> 01:15:45.656]  bases in Iraq, General says.
[01:15:45.656 --> 01:15:50.779]  So now we see our General saying that Iran, it wants to back attacks on U.S.
[01:15:50.779 --> 01:15:51.559]  troops in Iraq.
[01:15:51.559 --> 01:15:57.263]  Meanwhile, for five years, the White House admits under Bush and now Obama, consecutively, it's congruent.
[01:15:59.358 --> 01:16:07.761]  That they have four different terror groups, three of them Al-Qaeda backed, attacking Iranian bases and military and police in Iran.
[01:16:07.761 --> 01:16:09.742]  Iran has sued the U.S.
[01:16:09.742 --> 01:16:10.202]  at the U.N.
[01:16:10.202 --> 01:16:12.383]  over this and lays there and takes it.
[01:16:12.383 --> 01:16:16.165]  So our government launches terror attacks against them on a weekly basis.
[01:16:16.165 --> 01:16:16.365]  U.S.
[01:16:16.365 --> 01:16:19.266]  Special Forces have been there for at least eight years.
[01:16:19.266 --> 01:16:20.687]  Arabic U.S.
[01:16:20.687 --> 01:16:23.928]  citizens who are Special Forces doing this, and it's all admitted.
[01:16:24.528 --> 01:16:26.749]  It's an act of war, but Iran puts up with it.
[01:16:26.749 --> 01:16:28.229]  The average good ol' boy doesn't know that.
[01:16:28.229 --> 01:16:31.230]  They think, them Iranian Arabbers want to kill us.
[01:16:31.230 --> 01:16:34.410]  They're not Arabs, by the way.
[01:16:34.410 --> 01:16:35.711]  Here's another one.
[01:16:35.711 --> 01:16:37.951]  Iran's strike rumors are spinning out of control.
[01:16:37.951 --> 01:16:50.635]  A good boil-down article here where it links to all these mainstream news reports where Israel, the U.S., the U.N., NATO are all talking about striking Iran and calling for strikes on Iran.
[01:16:50.635 --> 01:16:51.155]  So, there.
[01:16:52.515 --> 01:16:58.401]  Gone over basically the latest Middle East, Central Asia news for you.
[01:16:58.401 --> 01:17:01.524]  I meant to get to that later, but since you brought it up, I've gotten to it now.
[01:17:01.524 --> 01:17:04.007]  Let's continue with your phone calls.
[01:17:04.007 --> 01:17:07.951]  Let us now speak with Lisa in New York.
[01:17:07.951 --> 01:17:08.852]  Lisa, you're on the air.
[01:17:09.969 --> 01:17:25.412]  Hi Alex, I was wondering about what you were mentioning yesterday that the government is planning on confiscating or somehow whoever has a retirement plan isn't really going to get a hold of it.
[01:17:25.412 --> 01:17:27.773]  Can you explain to me what you meant by that?
[01:17:27.773 --> 01:17:31.033]  Yes ma'am, I'm going to let you go because your phone is so bad, but it's an important question.
[01:17:31.033 --> 01:17:31.813]  Thanks for calling.
[01:17:31.813 --> 01:17:34.394]  Alright, this is a multi-faceted cocktail.
[01:17:35.194 --> 01:17:43.356]  There's so many ways that they steal part of or all of pensions that it would make your head spin, but let me just cover one way.
[01:17:43.356 --> 01:17:45.716]  And this is at record levels worldwide, not just in the U.S.
[01:17:45.716 --> 01:17:53.018]  You can search the term, retirees losing pensions at record rates.
[01:17:53.018 --> 01:17:57.038]  And it'll, hundreds of articles will come up, literally hundreds.
[01:17:57.038 --> 01:18:04.160]  One trick that General Electric or Kodak or General Motors or any of these companies will do, they've all done it.
[01:18:05.083 --> 01:18:08.184]  Defense contractors are doing this at record levels as they move to China.
[01:18:08.184 --> 01:18:09.304]  Oh, yeah, they're moving to China.
[01:18:09.304 --> 01:18:12.385]  Over 90% of our drugs are now made in China, including vaccines.
[01:18:12.385 --> 01:18:13.325]  Side issue.
[01:18:13.325 --> 01:18:16.326]  Not a national security issue to the government, though.
[01:18:16.326 --> 01:18:17.107]  They love it.
[01:18:17.107 --> 01:18:18.467]  The Chinese are part of eugenicists.
[01:18:18.467 --> 01:18:19.467]  They have a one-child policy.
[01:18:19.467 --> 01:18:20.668]  They're helping spike the vaccines.
[01:18:20.668 --> 01:18:21.908]  Of course, it's being made there.
[01:18:21.908 --> 01:18:24.189]  But I digress.
[01:18:24.189 --> 01:18:28.430]  One way that they do it is they will create a subsidiary.
[01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:32.551]  Take a famous computer microchip maker here in Austin.
[01:18:32.551 --> 01:18:34.412]  What, six years ago, they created a spinoff.
[01:18:35.562 --> 01:18:35.708]  And...
[01:18:38.407 --> 01:19:07.927]  Basically got rid of everybody's pensions and Shut down the old company and then hired Indian replacements and young people that had graduated here in the US I guess to speak English a small minority of them to manage that and that's just one example So what they do is they create subsidiaries to take your pensions Bush seven years ago spearheaded a change in the law that allowed corporations to take your
[01:19:08.627 --> 01:19:09.287]  We're good to go.
[01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:28.382]  And that companies need to do that.
[01:19:28.382 --> 01:19:42.592]  And then, of course, Bloomberg has reported that they are, the federal regulators, are now, quote, ordering, they don't have that power, but people follow the orders of these thugs, for private pension funds to be invested, quote, in failed banks.
[01:19:42.592 --> 01:19:45.214]  That's a Bloomberg headline.
[01:19:45.214 --> 01:19:47.896]  And so basically what they do is companies create subsidiaries.
[01:19:48.973 --> 01:19:55.207]  Then they bankrupt the old company, kind of like Enron did, and then that's how they don't pay you your pension.
[01:19:55.207 --> 01:19:57.732]  Or they reduce your pension.
[01:19:57.732 --> 01:19:59.315]  And yes, that's happening everywhere.
[01:19:59.315 --> 01:19:59.857]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:02.256 --> 01:20:11.060]  What started as an idea to provide power for a small hunting cabin has grown into a passion for creating an alternative energy source that's both affordable and reliable.

[01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:14.606]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.

[01:22:07.775 --> 01:22:16.263]  A similar audacity called GMO, or genetically modified organisms, means that the quality of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health in the balance.
[01:22:16.263 --> 01:22:21.747]  Now that summer's here, what better time to learn about the bounty that nature provides in wild edible food?

[01:22:35.421 --> 01:22:40.866]  Whatever experiment is being run on us, you can rest assured that Linda's 50 or so staple foods aren't involved.
[01:22:40.866 --> 01:22:42.087]  Our foods are their enemy.

[01:24:02.785 --> 01:24:08.808]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the Resistance.
[01:24:08.808 --> 01:24:11.349]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:24:23.132 --> 01:24:24.613]  I want to tell you a story now.
[01:24:24.613 --> 01:24:25.353]  Welcome back.
[01:24:25.353 --> 01:24:26.214]  I'm Rick Sanchez.
[01:24:26.214 --> 01:24:27.074]  This is Rick's List.
[01:24:27.074 --> 01:24:29.976]  This is a story about a guy named Nate Henn.
[01:24:29.976 --> 01:24:30.817]  This is important.
[01:24:30.817 --> 01:24:32.097]  Stay with me here.
[01:24:32.097 --> 01:24:36.560]  By all accounts, American Nate Henn was a hell of a guy.
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:40.782]  This is a selfless individual who devoted his young life to helping others.
[01:24:40.782 --> 01:24:43.524]  Today, he's dead.
[01:24:43.524 --> 01:24:44.345]  Nate Henn is dead.
[01:24:45.473 --> 01:24:52.076]  Killed by murderous terrorists in the faraway land of Uganda, where Han was working with children.
[01:24:52.076 --> 01:24:57.018]  Thousands of people had gathered in Uganda's capital to watch the final game of the World Cup.
[01:24:57.018 --> 01:24:58.939]  They're watching a soccer game.
[01:24:58.939 --> 01:25:02.680]  The game was in its 19th minute, when the bombs began to explode.
[01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:08.363]  One at a restaurant, then two at a rugby field, where they were watching on an outdoor screen.
[01:25:09.335 --> 01:25:12.682]  Our latest tally of the number who died, 74.
[01:25:12.682 --> 01:25:16.972]  74 innocent people are dead.
[01:25:16.972 --> 01:25:18.816]  Joining me now is Gary Punshton.
[01:25:19.386 --> 01:25:21.227]  He's a former CIA officer.
[01:25:21.227 --> 01:25:22.688]  But you know what's interesting about this?
[01:25:22.688 --> 01:25:36.198]  In a strange way, the event is helpful to the cause of those of us who know how sadistic these fundamental radical Islamic terrorists are.
[01:25:36.198 --> 01:25:42.163]  And if it helps get the message out there that these are not the good guys, then so be it.
[01:25:45.447 --> 01:25:59.375]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:25:59.375 --> 01:26:05.118]  Let's continue here with your phone calls coming up in the next segment.
[01:26:05.118 --> 01:26:08.040]  But first, I wanted to go back into this.
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:14.264]  CNN host calls deadly terror bombings helpful to New World Order agenda.
[01:26:16.354 --> 01:26:23.878]  CNN host Rick Sanchez let slip a telling admission in response to the deadly bombings in Uganda during his show yesterday.
[01:26:23.878 --> 01:26:34.724]  The fact that such attacks are quote, helpful for the military industrial complex agenda to take over and occupy third world countries after AFRICOM, the United States African Command.
[01:26:34.724 --> 01:26:39.907]  Speaking with former CIA agent Sanchez stated, you know what's interesting about this?
[01:26:39.907 --> 01:26:40.548]  It's strange
[01:26:41.448 --> 01:26:42.489]  We're good to go.
[01:27:03.584 --> 01:27:04.344]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[01:27:26.277 --> 01:27:28.939]  Well, you were talking about eugenics earlier.
[01:27:28.939 --> 01:27:33.623]  I'd like to equate circumcision with eugenics in America, this institution that started in 1955.
[01:27:33.623 --> 01:27:43.210]  It takes away the most erogenous zones of the male penis, results in a smaller head, which are connected to the brain.
[01:27:43.210 --> 01:27:45.171]  The nerves are connected to your brain.
[01:27:45.171 --> 01:27:53.538]  So it results in a smaller head size, less developed head and mental, physical prowess.
[01:27:53.538 --> 01:27:55.139]  Foreskin restoration is possible.
[01:27:55.956 --> 01:28:00.923]  I would recommend your listeners that are circumcised to Google for skin restoration.
[01:28:00.923 --> 01:28:08.716]  I read an article last night saying Bill Clinton and the CDC want circumcision to be mandatory worldwide in order to fight AIDS.
[01:28:10.136 --> 01:28:18.522]  I mean, that's incredible if that's true, because it is people's choice whether they get circumcised or not, and most Americans are not getting circumcised now.
[01:28:18.522 --> 01:28:24.167]  And, you know, there's arguments for and against, but let's go ahead and search that term.
[01:28:24.167 --> 01:28:26.929]  Bill Clinton calls for mandatory circumcision?
[01:28:26.929 --> 01:28:29.851]  Wow, if that's the case, that is outrageous.
[01:28:29.851 --> 01:28:31.532]  I can tell you it's Y-Night News.
[01:28:31.532 --> 01:28:33.213]  The title of the article is Clinton, colon,
[01:28:34.898 --> 01:28:40.127]  Circumcision-the-answer-to-AIDS is from Ynetnews.com.
[01:28:40.127 --> 01:28:41.910]  They use this false evidence...
[01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:55.343]  Well, we know AIDS is declassified to be a Navy bioweapon developed in the 70s as an autoimmune cancer virus.
[01:28:55.343 --> 01:28:58.364]  And we know what it does, and I've had top scientists on about that.
[01:28:58.364 --> 01:29:08.607]  And to claim that you could get AIDS through your skin, HIV is a very weak virus, and that it would have anything to do with it is just asinine.
[01:29:08.607 --> 01:29:09.887]  The answer is abstinence.
[01:29:10.627 --> 01:29:10.968]  I don't know.
[01:29:29.449 --> 01:29:30.790]  Using a new needle each time.
[01:29:30.790 --> 01:29:33.192]  They must be sharing needles in the vaccination.
[01:29:33.192 --> 01:29:33.813]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:29:33.813 --> 01:29:34.233]  Incredible.
[01:29:34.233 --> 01:29:34.833]  London Guardian.
[01:29:34.833 --> 01:29:37.796]  Circumcision may be the answer to age, says Clinton.
[01:29:37.796 --> 01:29:38.116]  All right.
[01:29:38.116 --> 01:29:38.697]  Thank you, sir.
[01:29:38.697 --> 01:29:39.797]  Glad you called.
[01:29:39.797 --> 01:29:42.279]  Dave, Matt, Jim, Kevin, many others are called straight ahead.
[01:29:42.279 --> 01:29:52.067]  Stay with us.
[01:29:52.067 --> 01:29:53.468]  We're on the march.
[01:29:53.468 --> 01:29:55.991]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.991 --> 01:29:58.673]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.468 --> 01:30:06.451]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:30:06.451 --> 01:30:07.431]  What have we got?
[01:30:07.431 --> 01:30:09.892]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:30:09.892 --> 01:30:10.893]  A republic.
[01:30:10.893 --> 01:30:13.534]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:30:13.534 --> 01:30:15.815]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:30:15.815 --> 01:30:17.836]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:30:17.836 --> 01:30:19.517]  So they think they own our land?
[01:30:19.517 --> 01:30:20.838]  They think they own our water?
[01:30:20.838 --> 01:30:21.438]  Children?
[01:30:21.438 --> 01:30:22.559]  Our education?
[01:30:22.559 --> 01:30:23.399]  Our money?
[01:30:23.399 --> 01:30:27.041]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:30:27.401 --> 01:30:31.105]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:30:31.105 --> 01:30:32.387]  You will be warned.
[01:30:32.387 --> 01:30:33.408]  We have the facts.
[01:30:33.408 --> 01:30:34.569]  We have the Constitution.
[01:30:34.569 --> 01:30:35.471]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:30:35.471 --> 01:30:36.352]  We have common law.
[01:30:36.352 --> 01:30:38.875]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:38.875 --> 01:30:42.659]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:30:42.759 --> 01:30:47.724]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:30:47.724 --> 01:30:49.225]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:30:49.225 --> 01:30:50.306]  Don't tread on me.
[01:30:50.306 --> 01:30:57.173]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:31:01.297 --> 01:31:05.839]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:05.839 --> 01:31:06.760]  Number one.
[01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:10.181]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:10.181 --> 01:31:11.041]  Number two.
[01:31:11.041 --> 01:31:15.924]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:15.924 --> 01:31:16.684]  It's true.
[01:31:16.684 --> 01:31:21.546]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:21.546 --> 01:31:22.387]  Number three.
[01:31:22.387 --> 01:31:25.968]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:25.968 --> 01:31:29.670]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:29.870 --> 01:31:30.670]  Number 4.
[01:31:30.670 --> 01:31:33.411]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:33.411 --> 01:31:37.113]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:37.113 --> 01:31:37.893]  Number 5.
[01:31:37.893 --> 01:31:42.035]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:42.035 --> 01:31:47.097]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:47.097 --> 01:31:51.258]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:51.258 --> 01:31:53.059]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:32:01.123 --> 01:32:01.883]  Listen up, folks.
[01:32:01.883 --> 01:32:02.824]  This is important.
[01:32:02.824 --> 01:32:03.944]  Alex Jones here.
[01:32:03.944 --> 01:32:12.289]  Now you can get free shipping on the storable, easy-to-fix, delicious food from efoodsdirect.com from July 4th through July 14th.
[01:32:12.289 --> 01:32:18.112]  We have looming evacuations in the Southeast, unemployment insurance running out, and predictions of huge inflation.
[01:32:18.112 --> 01:32:20.113]  So we all need to get as much food as we can.
[01:32:20.433 --> 01:32:23.596]  Every one of you needs to buy as much storable food as possible.
[01:32:23.596 --> 01:32:28.780]  This is the perfect time to do just that with eFoodsDirect and take advantage of their free shipping special.

[01:32:38.948 --> 01:32:43.412]  This is Alex Jones wishing you and your family true independence this 4th of July.
[01:32:43.632 --> 01:32:48.997]  With great food and free shipping through July 14th from efoodsdirect.com.

[01:32:52.199 --> 01:32:54.321]  That's 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com forward slash ship free.
[01:33:21.471 --> 01:33:25.633]  Okay, I'm going to continue with Dave, Matt, Jim, Kevin, Justin, and many others.
[01:33:25.633 --> 01:33:42.523]  I would like to hear a listener's take on CNN host Rick Sanchez saying that the terror attacks in Uganda that killed over 70 people are, quote, helpful, and that if it helps the agenda of the New World Order to launch all these wars, that so be it.
[01:33:42.523 --> 01:33:44.925]  And then we have a whole article with all these other globalists
[01:33:45.851 --> 01:33:53.736]  In fact, later, if I have time the next hour, I want to read this whole story, quoting in other mainstream articles about how great 9-11 was and how we need another one.
[01:33:53.736 --> 01:33:55.557]  Now, if you read Operation Northwoods, where the U.S.
[01:33:55.557 --> 01:34:03.843]  government says they want to bomb D.C., bomb Miami, shoot people, and blame it on foreign countries for World War III, you'll understand the mindset of this.
[01:34:03.843 --> 01:34:05.624]  False flag is taught to U.S.
[01:34:05.624 --> 01:34:08.786]  Army captains and above who are in special ops.
[01:34:08.786 --> 01:34:11.748]  That was declassified or leaked by WikiLeaks two years ago.
[01:34:11.748 --> 01:34:15.291]  The Pentagon admitted it was real, but said, we want to arrest whoever put this out.
[01:34:16.131 --> 01:34:21.254]  This was a manual being used up until 2004 that we know of.
[01:34:21.254 --> 01:34:23.475]  How to stage false flag terror attacks.
[01:34:23.475 --> 01:34:25.796]  So the army is taught how to stage terror.
[01:34:25.796 --> 01:34:26.417]  Okay?
[01:34:26.417 --> 01:34:28.858]  And they're all taught this, so they just go public with it.
[01:34:28.858 --> 01:34:29.758]  Hey, this is great!
[01:34:29.758 --> 01:34:30.799]  These people got killed.
[01:34:30.799 --> 01:34:32.220]  We can launch new wars.
[01:34:32.220 --> 01:34:34.341]  You know, top Pentagon brass sitting around with Rumsfeld.
[01:34:34.341 --> 01:34:38.123]  We have the audio of that linked on here going, Sir, 9-11 sure helped us.
[01:34:38.123 --> 01:34:40.004]  It would sure be good if we had another one.
[01:34:40.004 --> 01:34:41.585]  Rumsfeld's, I know, but it's hard.
[01:34:41.585 --> 01:34:41.705]  It's...
[01:34:42.731 --> 01:34:45.013]  You know, and they're like, yes, sir, we know.
[01:34:45.013 --> 01:34:48.577]  You can tell they're talking about 9-11 truth, and they're all, we'll take care of it, sir.
[01:34:48.577 --> 01:34:52.760]  We'll, I mean, that made news, what, four years ago.
[01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:56.144]  So we will, actually, that was only two and a half years ago.
[01:34:56.144 --> 01:34:59.026]  Boy, time flies.
[01:34:59.026 --> 01:35:02.589]  So that is some of what is coming up, and I'd like to hear callers comment on that.
[01:35:02.589 --> 01:35:04.771]  I think this is a pretty big deal.
[01:35:04.771 --> 01:35:06.973]  But continuing with the economic news,
[01:35:08.137 --> 01:35:10.760]  I want to recap this now.
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:12.982]  Central banks start to abandon the U.S.
[01:35:12.982 --> 01:35:13.582]  dollar.
[01:35:13.582 --> 01:35:16.665]  What an amazing statement from CNN.
[01:35:16.665 --> 01:35:20.009]  There's mounting evidence the central banks have little faith in the greenback.
[01:35:20.009 --> 01:35:22.191]  These days, can we blame them?
[01:35:22.191 --> 01:35:23.252]  And what are the central banks?
[01:35:23.252 --> 01:35:29.117]  The private holding consortiums of the top global banks worldwide, less than ten, six that dominate the U.S.
[01:35:29.938 --> 01:35:30.858]  They're all interconnected.
[01:35:30.858 --> 01:35:31.559]  They're globalists.
[01:35:31.559 --> 01:35:32.599]  They're against sovereignty.
[01:35:32.599 --> 01:35:40.263]  They want to take all of our sovereignty and all of our liberties and freedoms and transfer the laws to the international level so they can eradicate freedom.
[01:35:41.792 --> 01:35:46.975]  So there's CNN, Fortune Magazine's also running with the same headline.
[01:35:46.975 --> 01:35:49.937]  Central banks start to abandon the U.S.
[01:35:49.937 --> 01:35:57.461]  dollar and they go on to talk about how great the central bankers are and how they want to save us and how much we should love them and when these are the culprits.
[01:35:57.461 --> 01:35:59.683]  But people are so ignorant about finance and government.
[01:36:00.163 --> 01:36:03.587]  They don't even know the Federal Reserve is private, though that's starting to change.
[01:36:03.587 --> 01:36:08.532]  Chinese rating agency strips Western nations of AAA status.
[01:36:08.532 --> 01:36:20.826]  China's leading credit rating agency has stripped America, Britain, Germany and France of their AAA ratings, accusing Anglo-Saxon competitors of ideological bias in favor of the West.
[01:36:22.085 --> 01:36:24.688]  China is in a lip lock with the globalists.
[01:36:24.688 --> 01:36:26.570]  Mao Zedong was put in by the CIA.
[01:36:26.570 --> 01:36:28.593]  Again, that's declassified.
[01:36:28.593 --> 01:36:30.095]  They own most of our debt.
[01:36:30.095 --> 01:36:32.077]  But now they're going to bash the U.S.
[01:36:32.077 --> 01:36:37.243]  We'll lose our credit rating, so we'll pay even bigger interest rates to private banks for the right to have a U.S.
[01:36:37.243 --> 01:36:37.544]  dollar.
[01:36:38.578 --> 01:36:55.608]  So this is all part of moving away from the dollar and onto this global currency controlled by the Communist Chinese, who they'll then use as an industrial powerhouse to muscle every other country into total de-industrialization, which then bankrupts the nations, which is a form of financial military warfare.
[01:36:55.608 --> 01:36:58.630]  And then they come in with the police state behind that to physically dominate.
[01:36:59.758 --> 01:37:05.623]  The populations and joining us with 30 plus years researching the gold and silver market is Ted Anderson.
[01:37:05.623 --> 01:37:07.465]  Ted, I wanted to bring this next article up to you.
[01:37:07.465 --> 01:37:08.606]  That's why we've got you on today.
[01:37:08.606 --> 01:37:11.028]  Plus gold's up by over $16.
[01:37:11.028 --> 01:37:13.770]  Secret gold swap has spooked the market.
[01:37:13.770 --> 01:37:20.055]  And gold's actually up from this, but they spun this yesterday as if it would drive down gold.
[01:37:20.996 --> 01:37:26.840]  Saying that because central banks are secretly selling masses of gold to each other, but again, it's a swap.
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:29.942]  They sell it for a lower price to drive down the price.
[01:37:29.942 --> 01:37:33.164]  But the banks are all owned by the same people, so it's not really a sale.
[01:37:33.164 --> 01:37:34.625]  That's what Gata found.
[01:37:34.625 --> 01:37:37.848]  And it says, it takes a lot to spook the gold market.
[01:37:37.848 --> 01:37:48.355]  But when it emerged last week that one more bank had lent 380 tons of gold, the Bank of International Settlements, in return for foreign currencies, there was widespread surprise and confusion.
[01:37:50.865 --> 01:37:52.745]  Yeah, no, I read the same article, Alex.
[01:37:52.745 --> 01:37:59.447]  I mean, we got 380 tons of gold going to the International Bank of Settlements, so these guys can get more fiat currency.
[01:37:59.447 --> 01:38:03.808]  This is just private bankers getting the gold for fiat currency for themselves.
[01:38:03.808 --> 01:38:13.691]  This is the elites, as we've seen, the Saudi Arabians, the Chinese, the Japanese, the Indians, the Europeans, the US, all moving into gold, and they take this and spin it as if it's bad news for gold.
[01:38:14.761 --> 01:38:16.121]  Yeah, you're right about that.
[01:38:16.121 --> 01:38:16.862]  And it did.
[01:38:16.862 --> 01:38:22.464]  It did spook the marketplace enough, I guess, to drop it down into that $1,190 level.
[01:38:22.464 --> 01:38:24.324]  But then we've seen it come right back up again.
[01:38:24.324 --> 01:38:26.925]  Alex, those numbers that you're talking about are significant.
[01:38:26.925 --> 01:38:33.167]  It's almost the entire production for a year of gold being sold all at once in the marketplace.
[01:38:33.167 --> 01:38:35.588]  And no wonder why there's a negative
[01:38:36.528 --> 01:38:36.768]  I don't
[01:38:59.224 --> 01:39:05.487]  Three-four-day, mini-accelerated, because we're in the high-tech society, version of what happened in 33.
[01:39:05.487 --> 01:39:06.828]  And my grandmother remembers this.
[01:39:06.828 --> 01:39:12.691]  In fact, I've got to go out and interview World War II vets and people that are above 80 who do remember this before they all die.
[01:39:12.691 --> 01:39:20.555]  But this is on record from the 1933 War Powers Act and the reorganization of the U.S., the takeover of the states via the state police.
[01:39:20.555 --> 01:39:21.476]  But for those that don't know,
[01:39:22.296 --> 01:39:31.182]  They declared this emergency act when Roosevelt came in, and he ordered all gold turned into the government, all investment gold.
[01:39:31.182 --> 01:39:33.964]  And for one year, they depressed the price of gold by about 50%.
[01:39:33.964 --> 01:39:43.290]  Then one year later, they more than doubled the price up, and it turned out there'd been secret transfers to Europe of most of our gold supply.
[01:39:43.290 --> 01:39:48.653]  And then they went ahead and more than doubled the price to make a record profit for themselves.
[01:39:48.653 --> 01:39:51.675]  So this is a mini, well, not even a mini, this is a fast forward.
[01:39:51.715 --> 01:39:54.702]  Well, I mean, Alex, what happened in 1933 was a confiscation of the wealth of the people.
[01:40:00.043 --> 01:40:02.325]  And it was put in the hands of the elite.
[01:40:02.325 --> 01:40:11.251]  I mean, even when you read the Executive Order of 1933 issued by Franklin D. Roosevelt, he doesn't say that you have to turn this gold into the U.S.
[01:40:11.251 --> 01:40:12.131]  government.
[01:40:12.131 --> 01:40:16.715]  You have to turn the gold into a Federal Reserve Bank branch or agency.
[01:40:16.715 --> 01:40:21.018]  And what they did is they paid people $26 an ounce for that gold.
[01:40:21.018 --> 01:40:22.919]  One year later, they raised the price to $36 an ounce.
[01:40:25.014 --> 01:40:35.238]  The previous to this, the deal was, us as United States citizens, if we deposited a piece of gold at the bank, the bank would give us a certificate of deposit.
[01:40:35.238 --> 01:40:37.419]  It was called a $20 bill.
[01:40:37.419 --> 01:40:42.621]  And that $20 bill said a gold certificate, meaning that we have gold on deposit.
[01:40:42.621 --> 01:40:44.562]  If we go back to get our gold back,
[01:40:45.242 --> 01:40:45.322]  Yeah.
[01:41:02.427 --> 01:41:09.992]  Almost all the gold that you buy at good prices to be able to sell to the American people, you're buying from Europe.
[01:41:09.992 --> 01:41:17.476]  When everybody else has run out of gold sources, you've been in this business so long, you've got sources and it's almost all European, even a lot of the U.S.
[01:41:17.476 --> 01:41:23.140]  gold, the old eagles and other things that you buy is coming back in from Europe because
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:37.850]  The European bankers set up the Federal Reserve in 1913, and then a few decades later in 1933, they engineer the Depression and order everyone to turn their gold in for paper, and then they openly shipped it to Europe.
[01:41:37.850 --> 01:41:41.732]  That's another example of how they've bamboozled us over and over again.
[01:41:41.732 --> 01:41:51.198]  I mean, this was the biggest bank robbery in history, and now they've done the same thing with basically a one-year supply of gold for the entire world in a four-day period.
[01:41:51.198 --> 01:41:51.839]  This is incredible.
[01:41:52.159 --> 01:41:54.200]  Yeah, it is.
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:56.600]  It's just ridiculous when you think about it that way.
[01:41:56.600 --> 01:42:02.142]  And I just wish the people of the United States of America would wake up and see what really happened to them.
[01:42:02.142 --> 01:42:07.023]  I mean, the people in 1933, you know, they didn't know what they were doing economically.
[01:42:07.023 --> 01:42:09.344]  I mean, they're all farmers and labor.
[01:42:09.984 --> 01:42:12.786]  And, you know, they were hoodwinked.
[01:42:12.786 --> 01:42:14.747]  No question about it, Alex.
[01:42:14.747 --> 01:42:16.668]  That money was stolen from them.
[01:42:16.668 --> 01:42:22.232]  And like you said, it went to Europe because we're importing $20 Liberties and $20 St.
[01:42:22.232 --> 01:42:25.454]  Gaudens pieces and $10 Liberties from Europe for years.
[01:42:25.454 --> 01:42:32.078]  I mean, it all had to do with the Marshall Plan and, like you said, secret transfers that happened even before that.
[01:42:32.398 --> 01:42:35.080]  There is no reason why Europe should have had our gold.
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:36.401]  But yet it happened.
[01:42:36.401 --> 01:42:39.964]  And it isn't like it went to the European governments.
[01:42:39.964 --> 01:42:43.086]  It went to their central banks.
[01:42:43.086 --> 01:42:46.369]  You're talking about elite and all these games that they play.
[01:42:46.369 --> 01:42:52.533]  People could just wake up and see that the elected governments that are out there are not controlling the world.
[01:42:52.533 --> 01:42:56.696]  It's this shadow government behind the elected governments that are doing it.
[01:42:56.696 --> 01:42:57.257]  And that little
[01:42:57.777 --> 01:42:58.178]  Sell-Off
[01:43:13.357 --> 01:43:13.817]  We're good to go.
[01:43:35.948 --> 01:43:36.289]  I don't know.
[01:43:55.229 --> 01:44:09.377]  But, I mean, Ted, if the UN is announcing, if the IMF is announcing, if the World Bank is announcing that they're going to have concerted global currency devaluations, and they're saying it's the end of the dollar, and CNN, the New York Times, just everywhere, every day,
[01:44:10.177 --> 01:44:11.778]  And saying we deserve it.
[01:44:11.778 --> 01:44:15.520]  And saying the end of America, the beginning of China, taking over the planet.
[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:20.502]  Of course, if gold is dominated in global currencies, there's no way to keep gold down.
[01:44:20.502 --> 01:44:28.827]  But regardless, this really illustrates how manipulated and how criminal, I mean, not just the 1933, the Federal Reserve getting our gold through fraud.
[01:44:28.827 --> 01:44:30.287]  Of course, a lot of people didn't turn it in.
[01:44:30.287 --> 01:44:32.088]  A lot of my ancestors.
[01:44:32.088 --> 01:44:33.049]  People still alive didn't.
[01:44:33.669 --> 01:44:37.872]  You know, they turn a little in and then keep the rest, and that really made the bankers mad.
[01:44:37.872 --> 01:44:49.021]  But, I mean, good for Americans when foreign Federal Reserve that hijacked our country, you know, 20 years before, comes in and steals everybody's gold saying, you know, turn it in, be good Americans.
[01:44:49.021 --> 01:44:52.703]  Americans aren't going to do that the next time, these criminal scumbag.
[01:44:52.703 --> 01:44:59.469]  This is like Madoff and Kinlay ordering you to turn your gold in for paper coupons they give you, and then people go and do it.
[01:45:00.049 --> 01:45:01.810]  What if the government said, give us your children?
[01:45:01.810 --> 01:45:08.052]  I guess a lot of people do actually hand them over so they can fly them out of the country and be auctioned off at the orphanages.
[01:45:08.052 --> 01:45:24.038]  But Ted, it's just so massive to know all this was coming from reading Globalist documents and to now be living in a time when record gold sell-offs and it fails to drive down the price but for three or four days, they're openly announcing the end of the dollar.
[01:45:24.038 --> 01:45:25.118]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:45:25.118 --> 01:45:27.359]  They're openly announcing we're going into a depression, Ted.
[01:45:28.001 --> 01:45:31.203]  Well, let's just put it this way, Alex, and I think you already did.
[01:45:31.203 --> 01:45:36.567]  You cannot destroy the value of the dollar without an equal increase in the value of gold.
[01:45:36.567 --> 01:45:37.768]  It offsets one another.
[01:45:37.768 --> 01:45:40.610]  Gold has been valuable for 6,000 years.
[01:45:40.610 --> 01:45:41.850]  They didn't find U.S.
[01:45:41.850 --> 01:45:45.413]  paper fiat money in the Egyptian tombs when they opened them up.
[01:45:45.413 --> 01:45:46.473]  They found gold.
[01:45:46.473 --> 01:45:47.514]  And, Ted, let me add this.
[01:45:47.514 --> 01:45:49.135]  I mean, what about London Telegraph?
[01:45:49.135 --> 01:45:52.758]  Chinese rating agency strips the United States of AAA status.
[01:45:52.758 --> 01:45:54.459]  I mean, this is our biggest creditor.
[01:45:54.459 --> 01:45:55.580]  This is the group that buys
[01:45:56.300 --> 01:45:59.961]  You know, we buy cheap toasters that break as soon as you get them out of the box.
[01:45:59.961 --> 01:46:08.023]  They go and buy our currency to control us, and now they're kicking the United States around, which will actually devalue their biggest investment, but they don't care.
[01:46:08.023 --> 01:46:15.905]  They want to force everybody to move their industry to China, and the CFR is signaling America's over, move to China, more acts of high treason.
[01:46:15.905 --> 01:46:20.366]  They need to go arrest those CFR pieces of crap that have been writing all these policy papers.
[01:46:21.018 --> 01:46:22.098]  Yeah, they sure do.
[01:46:22.098 --> 01:46:24.979]  Boy, I tell you, it'd be nice to see some of that come along.
[01:46:24.979 --> 01:46:30.441]  Unfortunately, they're the ones that have their hands in the pockets of our lawmakers, and I don't know if we're going to see that.
[01:46:30.441 --> 01:46:40.944]  But one thing you can do for yourself is you can get yourself out of this paper funny money that they're giving us and get yourself into something real hard and tangible.
[01:46:40.944 --> 01:46:43.505]  I mean, if it's going to be bullets and guns, fine.
[01:46:44.025 --> 01:46:45.526]  But you can only have so much of that.
[01:47:03.832 --> 01:47:06.134]  Your eyes aren't open to what's happening here?
[01:47:06.134 --> 01:47:12.660]  I mean, the United States dollar is on a, you know, on a runaway track to hell, for God's sake.
[01:47:12.660 --> 01:47:13.040]  It is!
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:23.330]  I mean, the average yuppie is starting to pay a little bit of attention, but when they finally figure out what's happening, they are going to rush for commodities, and the strongest of those being gold and silver.
[01:47:23.330 --> 01:47:25.992]  Here's the Businessweek headline one hour ago.
[01:47:25.992 --> 01:47:27.674]  Gold gains most in a month.
[01:47:28.274 --> 01:47:31.435]  on increased demand for commodities.
[01:47:31.435 --> 01:47:33.936]  And gold's up over $16 today.
[01:47:33.936 --> 01:47:38.018]  And we're not saying it's a flying carpet, a golden parachute, or a silver bullet.
[01:47:38.018 --> 01:47:39.739]  We're not saying it's a panacea.
[01:47:39.739 --> 01:47:43.620]  We're not saying it's Valhalla, heaven, 40 virgins.
[01:47:43.620 --> 01:47:45.941]  What we're saying is it's the best thing out there.
[01:47:45.941 --> 01:47:47.942]  Guns, food, water filters.
[01:47:47.942 --> 01:47:52.364]  I mean, you cannot trust in these fiat currencies when they're openly saying they're gonna gut them.
[01:47:52.364 --> 01:47:55.345]  Ted, quickly, because I'm going to break and come back with calls and other news.
[01:47:55.345 --> 01:47:56.906]  Please tell listeners out there,
[01:47:57.446 --> 01:48:00.989]  They can call up and buy one silver coin, one gold coin, fifth of an ounce, an ounce.
[01:48:00.989 --> 01:48:02.711]  They can buy a thousand ounces.
[01:48:02.711 --> 01:48:09.077]  You've got it at the best prices because you always buy when it's low, sell when it's high, at the old low price.
[01:48:09.077 --> 01:48:16.484]  Give folks the offer, because most gold brokers out there literally have run out of gold in the last six months, or they've got giant premiums.
[01:48:16.484 --> 01:48:22.469]  Midas Resources, folks, with the specials we offer, I can certify these are smoking hot, awesome deals.
[01:48:22.469 --> 01:48:23.450]  Ted, give them today's offer.
[01:48:23.530 --> 01:48:24.150]  Yeah, sure.
[01:48:24.150 --> 01:48:34.633]  The Frank is a really good offer at $2.65, considering the fact that you get a four-year subscription to the International Forecaster, and that gives you the information on what's going on in the economy.
[01:48:34.633 --> 01:48:41.356]  The Walking Liberty Half at $9.75, I know that internet prices have shot well over $10 for that coin.
[01:48:41.356 --> 01:48:47.838]  We also have the Buffalo coin, and it's at the market price, but right now, I think that's right around that $1,300 level.
[01:48:49.318 --> 01:48:51.581]  But, you know, the market is volatile.
[01:48:51.581 --> 01:48:52.923]  It's going up.
[01:48:52.923 --> 01:48:56.567]  And Alex, I need to say, people need to get moving.
[01:48:56.567 --> 01:48:57.468]  We're in July.
[01:48:57.468 --> 01:49:00.372]  I know you have to go to break here real quick, but we're in July.
[01:49:00.372 --> 01:49:03.355]  We're looking forward to August, September, October, November.
[01:49:03.355 --> 01:49:05.338]  That's when the gold market gets really hot.
[01:49:05.738 --> 01:49:14.406]  And that's when you're going to see market peaks that you've never seen before, and it only makes sense to take advantage of it when the bankers are making it cheaper for you.
[01:49:14.406 --> 01:49:19.890]  When they're giving you a sale on gold, take advantage of it now, because now's the time to get in.
[01:49:19.890 --> 01:49:29.659]  When everything's going to, you know, to crap here in the fall, you know, by then it's almost too late to be getting into gold if you want to take advantage of these lower prices.
[01:49:29.659 --> 01:49:31.841]  So I would suggest that you move and you move now.
[01:49:33.993 --> 01:49:34.954]  Well said, Ted.
[01:49:34.954 --> 01:49:38.016]  The toll-free number for people who want to call is 800-686-2237.
[01:49:38.016 --> 01:49:39.057]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:49:39.057 --> 01:49:54.689]  They can also go to MidasResources.com, and you've got some really good specials up there on the site, but the very best deals are for people that call because they can give you that daily special.
[01:49:55.009 --> 01:50:07.899]  800-686-2237 and tell them it's the Ted Anderson Alex Jones special to take advantage because it will be a little bit more if you don't tell them it was the special and still that's a great deal but Ted is holding these prices for the next few days 800-686-2237.
[01:50:07.899 --> 01:50:10.802]  Ted, any other coins that you've got really good deals on?
[01:50:15.145 --> 01:50:17.727]  Well, we've got bags of junk silver, U.S.
[01:50:17.727 --> 01:50:20.089]  Eagles, we have Canadian Maple Leafs.
[01:50:20.089 --> 01:50:24.392]  Every now and then, we still get Krugerrands, which are lower in price.
[01:50:24.392 --> 01:50:35.660]  I mean, you name it, $10 and $20 liberties that are so close to melt that, you know, historically, they've traded for much higher premiums, and they're just right next to the melt value of gold.
[01:50:35.660 --> 01:50:40.304]  So, I would suggest, if you're getting into it, if you're looking at gold, call us now at 800-686-2237.
[01:50:43.726 --> 01:50:46.469]  Because, Alex, I just need to say it.
[01:50:46.469 --> 01:50:49.873]  People need to move before gold's up, not afterwards.
[01:50:49.873 --> 01:50:51.315]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:51.315 --> 01:50:53.677]  Ted, great job.
[01:50:53.677 --> 01:50:54.218]  God bless you.
[01:50:54.218 --> 01:50:55.439]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[01:50:55.439 --> 01:50:56.420]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:50:56.420 --> 01:50:58.062]  We'll be back with your calls and more news straight ahead.
[01:50:58.062 --> 01:50:58.423]  Stay with us.
[01:51:02.059 --> 01:51:03.360]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:08.943]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:08.943 --> 01:51:13.965]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.965 --> 01:51:19.008]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:19.528 --> 01:51:24.772]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:24.772 --> 01:51:27.073]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:51:27.073 --> 01:51:31.876]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:31.876 --> 01:51:32.997]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:32.997 --> 01:51:36.059]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:36.059 --> 01:51:39.702]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:39.702 --> 01:51:42.884]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:51:42.884 --> 01:51:45.105]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:51:45.105 --> 01:51:46.026]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:49.668 --> 01:51:53.893]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:53.893 --> 01:51:58.739]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:58.739 --> 01:52:01.122]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:01.912 --> 01:52:05.294]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:52:05.294 --> 01:52:09.196]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:52:09.196 --> 01:52:12.918]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?

[01:53:52.709 --> 01:53:56.171]  Okay, I want to race through your phone calls now because I haven't gotten into
[01:54:11.969 --> 01:54:18.861]  City governments, state governments, county governments announcing the police can't protect you.
[01:54:18.861 --> 01:54:22.226]  We're going to keep police on staff, but they're just there to write tickets.
[01:54:22.226 --> 01:54:24.590]  I mean, that's actually all over the news.
[01:54:25.913 --> 01:54:30.516]  There's big developments on the oil well front.
[01:54:30.516 --> 01:54:31.837]  And we'll talk about that as well.
[01:54:31.837 --> 01:54:33.718]  A lot coming up in the next hour.
[01:54:33.718 --> 01:54:37.541]  But I would ask callers, what do you think about the CNN host?
[01:54:37.541 --> 01:54:39.122]  In fact, I want to play that one more time.
[01:54:39.122 --> 01:54:47.768]  Just the very area of the clip where CNN host Rick Sanchez last night
[01:54:49.215 --> 01:55:03.223]  Yesterday with a CNN program talking to a CIA officer said that the bombings in Uganda are good and that it helps us understand how evil Al Qaeda is.
[01:55:03.223 --> 01:55:05.545]  And so if that's the case, so be it.
[01:55:05.545 --> 01:55:12.049]  And then we have all these other quotes by people in the military, newspaper reporters saying how great 9-11 was and how we need another one.
[01:55:13.473 --> 01:55:14.754]  Well, I'm telling you, I've researched this.
[01:55:14.754 --> 01:55:16.376]  We have links to it in the article.
[01:55:16.376 --> 01:55:22.682]  Most of this stuff ends up being government-sponsored, government-staged, and they're using it as a pretext to take your rights.
[01:55:22.682 --> 01:55:29.809]  Remember the MIAC and Homeland Security reports, where they're not worried about, you know, turban-headed men 8,000 miles away.
[01:55:29.809 --> 01:55:35.074]  They're talking about you and your property and your guns because you are a constitutionalist.
[01:55:35.074 --> 01:55:36.375]  You are the enemy of these banks.
[01:55:37.196 --> 01:55:41.522]  They've taken over hundreds and hundreds of nations in the last century.
[01:55:41.522 --> 01:55:44.005]  Some nations over and over again, repeatedly.
[01:55:44.005 --> 01:55:46.949]  They're ruthless, and people better grow up and realize that.
[01:55:46.949 --> 01:55:47.850]  Let's go ahead and play this clip.
[01:55:48.666 --> 01:55:50.107]  But you know what's interesting about this?
[01:55:50.107 --> 01:56:03.617]  In a strange way, the event is helpful to the cause of those of us who know how sadistic these fundamental radical Islamic terrorists are.
[01:56:03.617 --> 01:56:12.183]  And if it helps get the message out there that these are not the good guys, then so be it.
[01:56:12.183 --> 01:56:13.744]  Then so be it.
[01:56:13.744 --> 01:56:16.125]  So I hope that some of the callers want to comment on that.
[01:56:16.125 --> 01:56:18.067]  Dave in New York, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:56:19.599 --> 01:56:20.699]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:56:20.699 --> 01:56:22.020]  Welcome.
[01:56:22.020 --> 01:56:24.941]  You know, while I was at home, I just thought of something that's probably kind of important.
[01:56:24.941 --> 01:56:40.626]  I was doing work for a guy up in Grafton a few years ago, and I always get into, you know, the stuff we talk about, and he told me that he was proud because his son is the one that came up with the theory of how flight 800 went down, and that's the one they went with.
[01:56:40.626 --> 01:56:47.728]  So that's sort of like consensus for me, that he, you know, he writes the best friggin' essay, so then they, you know, turn it into a fact.
[01:56:47.728 --> 01:56:47.988]  Anyway.
[01:56:48.991 --> 01:57:00.303]  What I really want to talk to you about was, next time you take a well-deserved vacation, if you could rebroadcast the lady you interviewed that talked about Oklahoma, the one that went to James Trappican?
[01:57:00.303 --> 01:57:07.831]  Yes, in fact, Jane Graham was only on for 30 minutes and I said I would reschedule her, and so we'll set her up for a full hour in the next few weeks.
[01:57:07.831 --> 01:57:09.112]  Guys, let's get Jane Graham back on.
[01:57:09.793 --> 01:57:11.534]  I'm old to this, but it made my jaw drop.
[01:57:11.534 --> 01:57:14.317]  If I could play that to someone who would never believe it, they would believe it.
[01:57:32.389 --> 01:57:41.792]  When Bill Gates was in front of the globalists talking about reducing populations by inoculation, is that available on DVD or video?
[01:57:41.792 --> 01:57:53.735]  You can just simply go to YouTube, it's TED TV, and you can search Bill Gates talks about reducing population, and you'll get him on a bunch of different TV programs doing it, including TED TV.
[01:57:54.721 --> 01:57:56.182]  I have a Fred Flintstone computer.
[01:58:14.622 --> 01:58:24.049]  But what do you think of this news where it's Wall Street Journal, New York Times, CNN, hey, the dollar's gonna be replaced and it deserves it.
[01:58:24.049 --> 01:58:26.931]  Do you blame the bankers, those great guys?
[01:58:26.931 --> 01:58:33.897]  Hey, we just sold roughly the entire gold supply that's produced in one year and just on and on and on.
[01:58:33.897 --> 01:58:36.178]  I mean, so everything's accelerating.
[01:58:36.178 --> 01:58:39.281]  One day of news is like six months of news 10 years ago.
[01:58:39.281 --> 01:58:39.881]  It's wild.
[01:58:43.732 --> 01:58:46.357]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:59:56.932 --> 01:59:59.681]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:06.536 --> 02:00:11.358]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:11.358 --> 02:00:12.959]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.959 --> 02:00:14.499]  Well, so does he.

[02:00:18.701 --> 02:00:23.323]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.323 --> 02:00:25.084]  Alright, we're racing through your calls.
[02:00:25.084 --> 02:00:28.345]  It always takes us in interesting directions.
[02:00:28.345 --> 02:00:32.026]  And then at the bottom of the hour, I will blitz through news.
[02:00:32.026 --> 02:00:35.348]  And then if we have time, take a few more calls before that hour ends.
[02:00:36.741 --> 02:00:42.866]  Coming up, Fidel Castro has come out and said that he's afraid World War III is about to start.
[02:00:42.866 --> 02:00:44.988]  I want to go over his comments.
[02:00:44.988 --> 02:00:52.795]  They're announcing in Oakland that they're no longer going to respond to most crimes, and that's happening in many other areas of the country, and also the latest on the BP oil spill.
[02:00:52.795 --> 02:00:54.356]  But right now, let's go back to your calls.
[02:00:54.356 --> 02:00:57.499]  Matt in Minnesota, you're on the air.
[02:00:57.499 --> 02:00:58.480]  Hey, Alex.
[02:00:58.480 --> 02:00:59.661]  Welcome.
[02:00:59.661 --> 02:01:02.424]  Hey, yeah, in regards to this Rick Sanchez thing on CNN,
[02:01:03.854 --> 02:01:05.275]  You know, I find it disgusting.
[02:01:05.275 --> 02:01:11.962]  It's just like, uh, when Glenn Beck said we gotta shoot this POW in the head, and the guy in Fox & Friends saying the U.S.
[02:01:11.962 --> 02:01:24.895]  should use terrorism and car bombs in Iran, you know, the woman joking about assassinating Obama on Fox, and Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity saying over and over again that terrorism exists because, you know, they hate our freedom and liberty, women's rights.
[02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:33.166]  Like you've pointed out over and over again, I mean, the mainstream corporate media are the ones calling for violence.
[02:01:33.166 --> 02:01:38.051]  Not Alex Jones, not InfoWars, not the Tea Party, not the Oath Keepers, not alternative media.
[02:01:38.051 --> 02:01:39.132]  It's the corporate media.
[02:01:39.132 --> 02:01:41.074]  They're the ones always calling for violence.
[02:01:41.448 --> 02:01:57.893]  They're calling, I mean remember four years ago headlines where the Bush administration leaked the report that they were going to use hundreds of quote many nukes and they called it a nuclear war that's not nuclear to hit all the military sites in Iran and people were cheerleading that?
[02:01:57.893 --> 02:01:58.674]  I mean regardless
[02:01:59.915 --> 02:02:00.636]  Here's an example.
[02:02:00.636 --> 02:02:06.941]  Israel three years ago in Lebanon used tons and I mean calculated out tons and tons.
[02:02:06.941 --> 02:02:08.422]  You can pull up the exact number if you want.
[02:02:08.422 --> 02:02:18.891]  In fact, search engine guys, the amount of DU used in Israeli-Lebanon war, but the point is they use masses of DU munitions and the wins
[02:02:19.471 --> 02:02:19.651]  I think?
[02:02:42.802 --> 02:02:43.322]  We're good to go.
[02:03:05.265 --> 02:03:06.265]  Not smart at all.
[02:03:06.265 --> 02:03:08.906]  They're the dumbest weapons in history.
[02:03:08.906 --> 02:03:11.147]  And Israel now has been using it in Gaza.
[02:03:11.147 --> 02:03:13.407]  Well, where is Gaza?
[02:03:13.407 --> 02:03:17.189]  It's on the Mediterranean, right up against Egypt.
[02:03:17.189 --> 02:03:18.769]  Here's Israel.
[02:03:18.769 --> 02:03:26.151]  The jet stream blows right across major Israeli cities with the DU they used in Gaza.
[02:03:26.151 --> 02:03:28.092]  I mean, that's an even better example.
[02:03:28.092 --> 02:03:29.632]  This is lunatic land.
[02:03:31.823 --> 02:03:37.664]  We get demonized for using the Culpepper Don't Tread On Me flag in the media.
[02:03:37.664 --> 02:03:39.805]  But then meanwhile, they're constantly promoting violence.
[02:03:39.805 --> 02:03:40.625]  That's a really good point.
[02:03:40.625 --> 02:03:42.046]  Anything else?
[02:03:42.046 --> 02:03:53.248]  Yeah, you know, I just, I mean, like what the UN and the United States are saying to them in Iraq that, you know, killed some 500,000 people and, you know, the new war where a million people are dead.
[02:03:53.248 --> 02:03:54.969]  I mean, I don't know how much is enough.
[02:03:54.969 --> 02:03:58.370]  I mean, how many people do they want killed in these wars?
[02:03:58.370 --> 02:03:59.510]  The fact of the matter is that
[02:04:00.050 --> 02:04:06.033]  I mean, a majority of the Americans, I mean, not that they're just in a trance, but they're just dehumanized.
[02:04:06.033 --> 02:04:09.214]  I mean, people don't care about free humanity.
[02:04:09.214 --> 02:04:13.436]  They don't care about their species at all.
[02:04:13.436 --> 02:04:18.158]  Well, there's a stack of news I'm going to cover at the bottom of the hour that details that.
[02:04:18.158 --> 02:04:18.998]  And this is just...
[02:04:21.380 --> 02:04:35.594]  This is just what was in the stack today where, again, another major government report admitting that aspartame causes women to abort their babies and have miscarriages and have low birth weights.
[02:04:35.594 --> 02:04:40.258]  Well, they knew that with the rhesus monkeys and the green monkeys and other monkeys, but they tested it on in the 70s.
[02:04:40.258 --> 02:04:41.299]  I mean, they know this.
[02:04:41.299 --> 02:04:42.340]  That's why it's put in there.
[02:04:43.141 --> 02:04:46.884]  It's a cold-blooded... I've got the White House science czar saying we need to do stuff like this.
[02:04:46.884 --> 02:04:48.546]  I mean, these people are monsters.
[02:04:48.546 --> 02:05:00.136]  There's a bunch of psychopathic, control freak, chicken necks assaulting all of us with soft-kill, creepy weapons that these cowards use so red-blooded people don't know what hit them.
[02:05:00.136 --> 02:05:00.736]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:03.462 --> 02:05:07.423]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:07.423 --> 02:05:16.284]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:05:16.284 --> 02:05:20.905]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:05:20.905 --> 02:05:31.727]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:05:32.347 --> 02:05:41.869]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:41.869 --> 02:05:47.291]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.

[02:06:01.371 --> 02:06:05.833]  Alex Jones here with urgent information concerning TrendsResearch.com.
[02:06:05.833 --> 02:06:13.316]  The Trends Journal distills the voluminous ongoing research of the Trends Research Institute into a concise, readily accessible form.
[02:06:13.316 --> 02:06:16.758]  By tracking 300 separately defined domestic and international trends,
[02:06:17.378 --> 02:06:21.904]  The Trends Journal establishes the connections that others fail to see or misinterpret.
[02:06:21.904 --> 02:06:29.754]  Gerald Salente's Trends Journal allows you to anticipate change, recognize the implications, and take protective strategies.
[02:06:29.754 --> 02:06:34.481]  Individual readers from every walk of life can put the Trends Journal Trends Forecast
[02:06:34.761 --> 02:06:35.322]  I'm good to go.
[02:07:01.087 --> 02:07:05.650]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:05.650 --> 02:07:06.550]  Number 1.
[02:07:06.550 --> 02:07:09.973]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:09.973 --> 02:07:10.853]  Number 2.
[02:07:10.853 --> 02:07:15.736]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:15.736 --> 02:07:16.477]  It's true.
[02:07:16.477 --> 02:07:21.360]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:22.180]  Number 3.
[02:07:22.180 --> 02:07:25.763]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:25.763 --> 02:07:29.465]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:29.665 --> 02:07:30.465]  Number 4.
[02:07:30.465 --> 02:07:33.226]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:33.226 --> 02:07:36.907]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:36.907 --> 02:07:37.687]  Number 5.
[02:07:37.687 --> 02:07:41.828]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:41.828 --> 02:07:46.890]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:46.890 --> 02:07:51.071]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:51.071 --> 02:07:52.852]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:52.852 --> 02:07:57.453]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[02:07:57.773 --> 02:07:57.933]  877-327-0365.
[02:07:57.933 --> 02:07:59.976]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:07:59.976 --> 02:08:03.299]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:12.887 --> 02:08:17.550]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll free number.
[02:08:17.550 --> 02:08:23.835]  Bottom of the hour, huge news blitz, key medical news for you and your family coming up that is vital to your health and your life.
[02:08:23.835 --> 02:08:26.477]  Stay with us, this information is key.
[02:08:26.477 --> 02:08:29.659]  Kevin in Oregon, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[02:08:29.659 --> 02:08:31.241]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[02:08:31.241 --> 02:08:33.002]  Good sir, welcome.
[02:08:33.002 --> 02:08:36.925]  I would like to point out the story of Eric Scott in Las Vegas.
[02:08:36.925 --> 02:08:38.526]  I wanted to know if you'd heard about that.
[02:08:40.033 --> 02:08:42.834]  Um, my memory doesn't serve.
[02:08:42.834 --> 02:08:43.974]  Tell me about it.
[02:08:43.974 --> 02:08:52.755]  He was, uh, he had a legal, uh, carry permit, and he was shot by three, uh, cops in, uh, Costco.
[02:08:52.755 --> 02:08:54.576]  No, uh, give us his name again.
[02:08:54.576 --> 02:08:59.597]  I see these type of reports, unfortunately, on a weekly basis, uh, but his name is Eric Scott.
[02:08:59.597 --> 02:09:04.297]  Eric Scott, with a K, E-R-I-K, Scott.
[02:09:04.297 --> 02:09:06.978]  Eric Scott, uh, shot in, um, where?
[02:09:08.112 --> 02:09:11.135]  In Las Vegas and a Costco.
[02:09:11.135 --> 02:09:13.276]  And this guy was a West Point grad.
[02:09:13.276 --> 02:09:17.880]  He was a Duke University master's degree grad.
[02:09:17.880 --> 02:09:24.045]  Well respected and I was thinking he's also a friend of George Knapp from Coast to Coast AM.
[02:09:24.045 --> 02:09:27.988]  Maybe you could get him on and talk about it, but I'll take your comments off there.
[02:09:27.988 --> 02:09:28.909]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:09:28.909 --> 02:09:32.492]  We're writing all that down, George Knapp.
[02:09:32.492 --> 02:09:33.673]  I have not seen the report.
[02:09:34.864 --> 02:09:42.188]  But I have seen reports all the time where in Texas, you'll have a 243 or a shotgun in your gun rack.
[02:09:42.188 --> 02:09:45.270]  You're going dove hunting or whatever, but that's not its main use.
[02:09:45.270 --> 02:09:46.891]  It's for self-defense.
[02:09:46.891 --> 02:09:48.972]  And the cops pull you over.
[02:09:48.972 --> 02:09:50.873]  They flip out on you.
[02:09:50.873 --> 02:09:52.974]  They'll find some reason to arrest you.
[02:09:52.974 --> 02:09:54.375]  You see the reports constantly.
[02:09:54.375 --> 02:09:55.816]  It's, again, almost always
[02:09:56.772 --> 02:09:56.932]  I don't
[02:10:15.636 --> 02:10:24.401]  Uh, and, uh, I constantly see reports, mainly in New York State, Massachusetts, New Jersey, but I've seen it in Michigan.
[02:10:24.401 --> 02:10:25.982]  I've seen it in Texas.
[02:10:25.982 --> 02:10:28.023]  I mean, I've seen so many of these, it makes my head spin.
[02:10:28.023 --> 02:10:35.567]  I know you've seen them, uh, where it's almost always an old man because old men love to tinker and they got all their tools.
[02:10:35.567 --> 02:10:37.048]  Let me tell you, seeing, uh,
[02:10:37.987 --> 02:10:41.008]  That Clint Eastwood movie?
[02:10:41.008 --> 02:10:41.869]  It's the name of a car.
[02:10:41.869 --> 02:10:43.229]  Grand Torino.
[02:10:43.229 --> 02:10:46.711]  I've known so many old vets that are literally just like that guy.
[02:10:46.711 --> 02:10:47.471]  You know, that character.
[02:10:47.471 --> 02:10:48.551]  That's why that movie's so popular.
[02:10:48.551 --> 02:10:50.512]  Everybody knows a character like that.
[02:10:50.512 --> 02:10:59.856]  And, you know, you're a kid, and they invite you over to their garage, and everything's all neat in there, and they teach you how to saw and drill, and, you know, and you ask them to tell you war stories, and they won't.
[02:11:00.456 --> 02:11:00.857]  I don't know.
[02:11:16.633 --> 02:11:17.894]  I mean, I had grandpas like that.
[02:11:17.894 --> 02:11:19.894]  You know, you go in their work shed.
[02:11:19.894 --> 02:11:26.917]  In fact, my dad's dad had a work shed with his fly fishing equipment and his bass fishing equipment and woodwork and tools.
[02:11:26.917 --> 02:11:30.978]  And, you know, he'd take me in there and show me stuff.
[02:11:30.978 --> 02:11:32.519]  And it's always the same.
[02:11:32.519 --> 02:11:38.601]  You'll have a brainwashed, un-American, domesticated slimeball.
[02:11:38.601 --> 02:11:41.222]  And they'll be walking by in rural areas.
[02:11:41.222 --> 02:11:42.203]  It happens a lot in L.A.
[02:11:43.223 --> 02:11:51.367]  I saw a news report a few years ago about this and they'll see the person's garage up and they'll be in there cleaning a rifle.
[02:11:51.367 --> 02:11:54.509]  I mean, how many times did I see my grandfather out in the shed cleaning a rifle?
[02:11:55.581 --> 02:11:57.382]  Young people today buy guns, and I've watched them.
[02:11:57.382 --> 02:11:59.224]  They don't even clean them when they go out and shoot them.
[02:11:59.224 --> 02:12:02.286]  But you know, those old vets, it was religious.
[02:12:02.286 --> 02:12:05.828]  Let's go clean the rifles, and you get in there and they're taking them apart.
[02:12:05.828 --> 02:12:16.075]  One of these brainwashed yuppies, or whatever they are, whatever you want to call them, these domesticated, gelded creatures who've been castrated, they see you with a gun.
[02:12:16.075 --> 02:12:16.975]  And I've told the story.
[02:12:16.975 --> 02:12:21.979]  I lived in an apartment in college, and I was going to go deer hunting.
[02:12:22.839 --> 02:12:27.303]  And I walked out, my Mustang was parked with a hatchback right by my door.
[02:12:27.303 --> 02:12:38.693]  I was out there maybe five seconds, walked out, stuck the rifle in the back, stuck a box of shells in there, and forgot something, and came back ten minutes later and the police were there.
[02:12:39.153 --> 02:12:42.255]  And I said, and they said, have you seen a man with a gun that matches your description?
[02:12:42.255 --> 02:12:43.916]  I said, yeah, it's a deer rifle.
[02:12:43.916 --> 02:12:46.217]  And the cop went, somebody got scared and called.
[02:12:46.217 --> 02:12:46.818]  OK.
[02:12:46.818 --> 02:12:49.599]  And now cops last for a license.
[02:12:49.599 --> 02:12:53.262]  This one, I guess, was a Patriot and said, OK, I just had to come and have a good one.
[02:12:53.262 --> 02:12:54.522]  I'm going hunting this weekend, too.
[02:12:54.522 --> 02:12:56.404]  Literally, that's what happened.
[02:12:56.404 --> 02:12:58.245]  One time I got pulled over for speeding in Waco.
[02:12:58.245 --> 02:13:01.547]  It was me and two of my high school buddies.
[02:13:01.547 --> 02:13:02.147]  We were in college.
[02:13:02.147 --> 02:13:04.608]  There were two UT football players, Alex and
[02:13:05.814 --> 02:13:13.818]  Well, the point is we were there and the cop pulled us over and there were like 15 guns in the back because we wanted to go shoot all of our guns out at my family ranch.
[02:13:13.818 --> 02:13:16.459]  We were driving East Texas and he looked at them and...
[02:13:17.403 --> 02:13:20.145]  And said, okay, we'll have fun and hunting and shooting.
[02:13:20.145 --> 02:13:26.809]  But you run into the wrong cop, they're gonna go ahead and, I see it in the news constantly where they say, the man was arrested for an arsenal.
[02:13:26.809 --> 02:13:30.531]  And then I'll go check that state's law and there's no law against a arsenal.
[02:13:30.531 --> 02:13:34.894]  And I've seen an arsenal be as many as five guns they'll call an arsenal.
[02:13:34.894 --> 02:13:37.536]  I've seen them call 500 rounds of ammo an arsenal.
[02:13:37.536 --> 02:13:43.840]  I've seen reports all over the country where now people who buy over 500 rounds get a homeland security visit
[02:13:44.700 --> 02:13:46.021]  At their house.
[02:13:46.021 --> 02:13:50.462]  And so the subject you bring up, I need to go back to calls, but now I'm ranting on this.
[02:13:50.462 --> 02:13:54.644]  The subject you bring up just brings to mind thousands of stories.
[02:13:54.644 --> 02:14:00.566]  I mean, every second a new one that I remember reading about or seeing pops into my mind.
[02:14:00.566 --> 02:14:10.109]  And now people all over the country in Nevada and Arizona and Vermont and other places where it's legal to open carry, they're starting to say, you know what?
[02:14:10.109 --> 02:14:11.850]  I'm tired of you intimidating Second Amendment.
[02:14:12.796 --> 02:14:15.418]  Defenders, I'm tired of you saying our guns are dirty and bad.
[02:14:15.418 --> 02:14:29.951]  We're going to wear these guns openly and the media hates it because how are they going to demonize it and imply guns are illegal if we start openly carrying them and taking our right back by exercise and by precedent.
[02:14:29.951 --> 02:14:33.594]  And so I do see those reports where the police just completely flip out.
[02:14:33.594 --> 02:14:34.735]  Of course, there's the famous case.
[02:14:34.735 --> 02:14:37.457]  I've probably told the story 50 times.
[02:14:37.457 --> 02:14:40.040]  This was got to be 12 years ago.
[02:14:41.181 --> 02:14:45.963]  And I had a carpet cleaner in my house, and I broadcast out of my house at the time.
[02:14:45.963 --> 02:14:47.024]  I'd already gotten syndicated.
[02:14:47.024 --> 02:14:49.165]  I was on about 20 stations at the time.
[02:14:49.165 --> 02:14:54.747]  And he was in my broadcast studio, and I didn't have children then, so my shotgun was out openly on a double rifle rack.
[02:14:54.747 --> 02:15:04.812]  But it was just a shotgun up there, a Winchester Defender, like a $200 at the time shotgun from, I believe I bought that at Oshman's, a special I saw on the paper.
[02:15:05.752 --> 02:15:05.872]  It's
[02:15:26.340 --> 02:15:31.062]  Chris Costillo describes his coworker and good friend Eric Scott in glowing terms.
[02:15:31.062 --> 02:15:38.826]  He served his country, West Point Grab, a grad Duke Master's degree, a solid business guy, Costillo said.
[02:15:38.826 --> 02:15:43.868]  Costillo was shocked that Scott was shot and killed by Metro Police Saturday afternoon.
[02:15:43.868 --> 02:15:45.789]  It was very, very hard to believe.
[02:15:45.789 --> 02:15:50.511]  Everybody was in disbelief as to what the heck could have happened and why, Costillo said.
[02:15:50.511 --> 02:15:52.392]  A 38-year-old medical salesman,
[02:15:53.072 --> 02:15:53.552]  We're good to go.
[02:16:18.780 --> 02:16:23.323]  It's kind of like that line from First Blood where they say, it'll read on John Rambo's tombstone.
[02:16:23.323 --> 02:16:25.224]  Killed for jaywalking.
[02:16:25.224 --> 02:16:27.025]  Killed for loitering.
[02:16:27.025 --> 02:16:31.968]  He threw a few on the floor and put other ones within his cart.
[02:16:31.968 --> 02:16:33.129]  Sounds like they're making that up.
[02:16:33.129 --> 02:16:38.452]  Yeah, the guy's just, so he might have set it there and then somebody got mad because one fell off or something, who knows.
[02:16:38.452 --> 02:16:40.694]  So don't drop something in a store or you're dead.
[02:16:40.694 --> 02:16:45.597]  Police say customers complained about Scott's behavior, allegedly argued with security, refused to obey officers when they arrived.
[02:16:46.337 --> 02:16:52.520]  He goes into his waistband area, puts his hands on his weapon, is going for the weapon, Captain Neville said.
[02:16:52.520 --> 02:16:57.443]  The officer then begins to issue verbal commands for him to get on the ground, get on the ground, get on the ground.
[02:16:57.443 --> 02:16:59.444]  Three officers then fired seven shots.
[02:16:59.444 --> 02:17:04.506]  We have over a dozen witnesses that saw the individual pull a weapon from his waistband, Captain Neville said.
[02:17:04.506 --> 02:17:11.770]  You know, I'd love to be able to believe that, but we just saw the cop get second-degree manslaughter.
[02:17:11.770 --> 02:17:13.831]  He'll serve two to four years in Oakland.
[02:17:14.946 --> 02:17:40.502]  For putting a man in handcuffs for no reason on a platform and then shooting him in the back and then they rough him up after they shoot him in the back and then he died and then they lied and they tried to grab everybody's cell phone cameras but people one guy was down the ramp and got some footage of it and was able to get away somebody else was on a train that stopped and they got it and they said that the man had assaulted the officers and was not in handcuffs and had gone for their weapon.
[02:17:40.962 --> 02:17:42.663]  And of course, he was in handcuffs on the ground.
[02:17:42.663 --> 02:17:46.865]  They were jumping on his head and beating him up and doing what bullies do, I guess.
[02:17:46.865 --> 02:17:48.566]  And then they killed him.
[02:17:48.566 --> 02:17:49.767]  And then it wasn't enough to kill him.
[02:17:49.767 --> 02:17:57.671]  They lied about him and tried to abscond and engage in conspiracy to cover up the murder.
[02:17:57.671 --> 02:18:00.633]  And so, I mean, who knows if this is true?
[02:18:00.633 --> 02:18:04.715]  How many cop car tapes have we seen where the cops plant drugs on somebody?
[02:18:04.715 --> 02:18:09.558]  How many cop car tapes have you seen where they beat the daylights out of somebody and then file a report that they assaulted him?
[02:18:10.589 --> 02:18:14.552]  I mean, how many times have we seen Austin cops shoot somebody in the back and then lie about it later?
[02:18:14.552 --> 02:18:23.519]  And, you know, my issue is they're hiring a bunch of politically correct cowards who are scared to death of everybody, and they're hiring a bunch of thugs who like to kill people, and we don't need that.
[02:18:23.519 --> 02:18:28.122]  You know, we need strong men and women who understand preserving life is everything.
[02:18:28.122 --> 02:18:33.566]  And if you're too scared and are trigger-happy because, you know, you think somebody's trying to kill you, don't be a cop!
[02:18:33.566 --> 02:18:33.806]  Okay?
[02:18:33.806 --> 02:18:37.850]  You need to be a peace officer, a guardian, not a crazy man.
[02:18:38.675 --> 02:18:41.439]  Okay, let's jam in a call here before we go to break.
[02:18:41.439 --> 02:18:43.061]  Let's talk to Mike in Chicago.
[02:18:43.061 --> 02:18:43.762]  Mike, you're on the air.
[02:18:43.762 --> 02:18:45.825]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[02:18:45.825 --> 02:18:47.327]  I'm alright, sir.
[02:18:47.327 --> 02:18:52.074]  Since you were talking about firearms, I'm gonna bring it up real quick and then I gotta get to the point that I called you about.
[02:18:52.074 --> 02:18:54.137]  Have you ever heard of the limited-life cartridge primers?
[02:18:55.563 --> 02:19:12.753]  Yes, I know that the government is moving, and California proposed it a few years ago, to have the caps that ignite the powder in the cartridge, to have those failed after five years, I believe was the bill I saw.
[02:19:12.753 --> 02:19:24.059]  Now they already have it where any guns sold in California have to be stamped with the weapon's serial number, which also just basically makes most gun manufacturers not sell in California.
[02:19:24.059 --> 02:19:24.620]  But go ahead.
[02:19:25.838 --> 02:19:34.064]  If you read the patent description online, limited-life cartridge primers, it tells you that the reason that they came up with the idea is so that citizens couldn't stockpile ammunition.
[02:19:34.064 --> 02:19:35.785]  But that wasn't the reason I called.
[02:19:35.785 --> 02:19:41.590]  Two hits that are going to come to the financial markets and our economy in general... Well, stay there, stay there.
[02:19:41.590 --> 02:19:43.071]  I've got to come back to you, Mike.
[02:19:43.071 --> 02:19:45.993]  Then Terry, Bev, Jim, and George, and that'll probably be it.
[02:19:45.993 --> 02:19:47.134]  I'll at least get to those calls.
[02:19:47.995 --> 02:19:56.051]  But then I've got to blitz through news in this hour because there is so much key info coming up and I am committed to cover it.
[02:19:56.051 --> 02:19:57.574]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:57.574 --> 02:19:58.996]  Great job, crew.
[02:19:58.996 --> 02:19:59.417]  Stay with us.
[02:20:02.145 --> 02:20:06.688]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:20:06.688 --> 02:20:07.608]  Number 1.
[02:20:07.608 --> 02:20:11.031]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:20:11.031 --> 02:20:11.891]  Number 2.
[02:20:11.891 --> 02:20:16.774]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:20:16.774 --> 02:20:17.515]  It's true.
[02:20:17.515 --> 02:20:22.398]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:20:22.398 --> 02:20:23.218]  Number 3.
[02:20:23.218 --> 02:20:26.801]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:20:26.801 --> 02:20:30.503]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:20:30.703 --> 02:20:31.504]  Number 4.
[02:20:31.504 --> 02:20:34.267]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:20:34.267 --> 02:20:37.951]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:20:37.951 --> 02:20:38.731]  Number 5.
[02:20:38.731 --> 02:20:42.896]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:20:42.896 --> 02:20:47.661]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:22:01.823 --> 02:22:04.226]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:22:04.226 --> 02:22:06.549]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:22:06.549 --> 02:22:09.754]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:22:09.754 --> 02:22:14.860]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:22:14.860 --> 02:22:19.046]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:22:19.346 --> 02:22:21.709]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:22:21.709 --> 02:22:24.252]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:22:24.252 --> 02:22:27.496]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:22:27.496 --> 02:22:35.105]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:22:35.425 --> 02:22:40.828]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:22:40.828 --> 02:22:43.669]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:22:43.669 --> 02:22:47.371]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:22:47.371 --> 02:22:48.431]  And I got news for you.
[02:22:48.431 --> 02:22:49.792]  You're everyone else.
[02:22:49.792 --> 02:22:51.273]  Invisible Empire.

[02:23:01.070 --> 02:23:10.574]  Nine years, thousands of clients worldwide, amazing results, and here's more proof of the effectiveness of how Heart and Body Extract supports good circulation and healthy arterial flow.
[02:23:10.574 --> 02:23:11.894]  My name is Crystal.
[02:23:11.894 --> 02:23:14.815]  I'm a 45-year-old and live in Houston, Texas.
[02:23:14.815 --> 02:23:18.797]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[02:23:18.797 --> 02:23:22.758]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[02:23:22.938 --> 02:23:23.779]  What did Crystal do?
[02:23:23.779 --> 02:23:27.724]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.
[02:23:27.724 --> 02:23:34.131]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.
[02:23:34.131 --> 02:23:37.695]  Clean, clear arteries are happy arteries after using Heart and Body Extract.

[02:24:12.423 --> 02:24:15.484]  Okay, Mike in Chicago.
[02:24:15.484 --> 02:24:19.025]  Go ahead and get to your next point, sir.
[02:24:19.025 --> 02:24:25.368]  Okay, the two big hits that we're going to see towards the end of the year are going to be the option adjustable rate mortgages coming to maturity.
[02:24:25.368 --> 02:24:30.369]  A lot of that is going to be commercial real estate, but that's going to be another big hit to the real estate market.
[02:24:30.369 --> 02:24:33.611]  The Bush tax cuts from early 2000-2003 expire at the end of the year.
[02:24:35.379 --> 02:24:43.582]  And lastly, knowing that the incumbents are on their way out, what do you think the chances of the American people going to the polls in a state of duress is?
[02:24:43.582 --> 02:24:47.944]  Because the system is absolutely terrified that people are going to kick out the incumbents.
[02:24:47.944 --> 02:24:53.006]  So what is your opinion on us going to the polls in a state of duress?
[02:24:53.006 --> 02:25:00.270]  Well, I tell you, I have never thought that they would actually suspend elections, though we've heard rumors about it.
[02:25:00.270 --> 02:25:03.231]  But the way they're going to use this oil spill and the way it's going to be peaking
[02:25:04.525 --> 02:25:04.865]  Right now?
[02:25:27.376 --> 02:25:27.696]  I don't
[02:25:50.973 --> 02:26:05.543]  With the Democrats set to lose the House and Senate and the Republicans that are getting elected are anti-establishment in almost all these races like Rand Paul and others and pro-government Democrats, pro-corruption Democrats are losing their primaries as well in all these primaries.
[02:26:05.543 --> 02:26:09.906]  So the evidence is this is the biggest political realignment since 1776.
[02:26:11.727 --> 02:26:13.108]  And I'm not the only one saying that.
[02:26:13.108 --> 02:26:17.230]  This is a complete awakening that is just beginning right now.
[02:26:17.230 --> 02:26:19.952]  And I don't think World War III is gonna cut it.
[02:26:19.952 --> 02:26:23.134]  I don't think oil spill martial law is gonna get it done.
[02:26:23.134 --> 02:26:27.096]  I don't think total collapse of the economy will get it done.
[02:26:27.096 --> 02:26:28.497]  People know who the enemy is now.
[02:26:28.497 --> 02:26:34.040]  They understand a bunch of Bernie Madoff, Ken Lay type scammers are running everything.
[02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:36.802]  But the system isn't gonna give up and they're gonna go ahead with all this.
[02:26:36.802 --> 02:26:38.823]  So it's two speed trains
[02:26:39.423 --> 02:26:42.864]  You know, going 150 miles an hour a piece, total speed 300.
[02:26:42.864 --> 02:26:45.144]  When they connect, it's gonna be hellish.
[02:26:45.144 --> 02:26:51.245]  And so, that's why I'm saying, everybody can feel the hair on the back of their neck stand up, in their spirit.
[02:26:51.245 --> 02:26:54.306]  You can feel it in your gut, not just in the news.
[02:26:54.306 --> 02:26:57.186]  This is an incredible time.
[02:26:57.186 --> 02:27:01.367]  This is the exact same atmosphere we had pre-World War I, pre-World War II.
[02:27:01.367 --> 02:27:02.787]  I mean, this is it.
[02:27:02.787 --> 02:27:05.548]  This is the, this is, I mean, I don't know what to say.
[02:27:05.548 --> 02:27:06.028]  What's your take?
[02:27:07.371 --> 02:27:10.012]  They're really, I can't add any more to it.
[02:27:10.012 --> 02:27:14.874]  We're aligned perfectly and I don't see the system, they're not going to relinquish control.
[02:27:14.874 --> 02:27:19.156]  They've got their computerized voting in place, they could rig elections, but nobody's going to buy it.
[02:27:19.156 --> 02:27:19.956]  Yeah, they planned all this.
[02:27:19.956 --> 02:27:21.257]  They planned for the awakening.
[02:27:21.257 --> 02:27:22.858]  That's what Homeland Security is.
[02:27:22.858 --> 02:27:27.119]  That's why in all the secret documents they hate the citizens and are trying to take over every city.
[02:27:27.119 --> 02:27:32.021]  That's why they're suddenly putting troops all over the street and saying, oh, we're here to help for drunk driving, we're here to help get guns.
[02:27:33.302 --> 02:27:34.563]  But the troops are waking up.
[02:27:34.563 --> 02:27:40.386]  I mean, they plan for us to get awake and angry, but I don't think they plan for it to be this big.
[02:27:40.386 --> 02:27:43.809]  And they admit that, as Brzezinski said a month ago, two months ago.
[02:27:43.809 --> 02:27:45.210]  And so the battle is joined.
[02:27:45.210 --> 02:27:46.110]  I mean, this is history.
[02:27:46.110 --> 02:27:52.994]  Right now, we're living, we're gonna look back on this five years from now, and we're gonna say, my God, what if I'd have done more?
[02:27:52.994 --> 02:27:54.495]  What if I'd have warned more people?
[02:27:54.495 --> 02:27:59.038]  What if we would have, all of us who are even patriots and awake, had realized just how real this is?
[02:27:59.038 --> 02:28:01.340]  Because we have a psychological weakness, myself included.
[02:28:02.486 --> 02:28:09.730]  That because we're informed and know what's going on, and have been so informed for so long, we're almost comfortable with it.
[02:28:09.730 --> 02:28:16.554]  It's like somebody who's dying of cancer for a year, generally they're ready for it by the end, but somebody who dies in a month, generally is freaking out when they die.
[02:28:16.554 --> 02:28:25.299]  So it's kind of like we've been waiting to die as a country, and we've been seeing it happen, those of us that are informed, so we almost at a subconscious level expect it, and just want to get it over with.
[02:28:25.299 --> 02:28:28.941]  Well, we better get the word out now so we can survive this, because this is
[02:28:30.640 --> 02:28:45.605]  I mean, if we have a full-born collapsed depression here and 7 million starved to death in the depression in the 30s, what's going to happen this time when people were much more moral and much more sophisticated and much more self-sufficient 70 years ago?
[02:28:45.605 --> 02:28:46.605]  What is going to happen now?
[02:28:47.879 --> 02:28:48.400]  Absolutely.
[02:28:48.400 --> 02:28:57.648]  You know, if anybody actually wants to try and prove whether or not that we actually don't have a two-party system, the easiest way to look at it is how we've gotten to where we are now.
[02:28:57.648 --> 02:29:03.974]  If you go back and you look at the trade agreements, NAFTA, the framework agreements for NAFTA were signed by Bush 41, Bush Senior.
[02:29:03.974 --> 02:29:08.098]  Then Clinton came in, since Bush didn't get re-elected, and signed it into law.
[02:29:08.098 --> 02:29:12.022]  We've been tossed by both parties over and over and over again.
[02:29:13.383 --> 02:29:30.490]  The fence is on the way to the slaughterhouse and they just keep the cattle bouncing in between the fences and the end result is going to be really bad for everybody.
[02:29:30.490 --> 02:29:34.232]  I don't even want to put it into words, but it is going to be really bad for everybody.
[02:29:34.232 --> 02:29:36.193]  We're really heading towards it and they've got us.
[02:29:37.540 --> 02:29:52.175]  Well, we just better get the word out now like our lives depend on it, folks, because, and all you that work for the government and these corporations, you better decide right now what side you're on, because, heh, heh, this is serious.
[02:29:52.175 --> 02:29:53.577]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.577 --> 02:29:56.100]  The Empire's on the run.

[02:33:36.053 --> 02:33:43.859]  And Jeremy, but Mike was bringing up so many hardcore issues, I burned a lot of time with him, so I'm going to give each caller about a minute and a half because I've got to get to all this news.
[02:33:43.859 --> 02:33:51.364]  I've made a commitment to cover everything I put on my plate every day, to cover it, because I've done an analysis and notice we're covering about a third.

[02:33:56.368 --> 02:33:59.292]  They were on target to get all the information out.
[02:33:59.292 --> 02:34:04.157]  Then, of course, even more gets posted at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com after the show.

[02:35:37.470 --> 02:35:38.790]  Terry in Georgia.
[02:35:38.790 --> 02:35:40.611]  You're on the air.
[02:35:40.611 --> 02:35:41.231]  Hello, Alex.
[02:35:41.231 --> 02:35:43.152]  Glad to hear you on the radio.
[02:35:43.152 --> 02:35:43.792]  Good to have you, sir.
[02:35:43.792 --> 02:35:45.812]  What's on your mind?
[02:35:45.812 --> 02:35:47.733]  Quick question.
[02:35:47.733 --> 02:35:51.174]  I haven't heard anything else anywhere on the internet or
[02:35:52.051 --> 02:35:54.313]  Regular TV.
[02:35:54.313 --> 02:35:59.397]  Why ain't anybody talking about the oil reaching the Atlantic already?
[02:35:59.397 --> 02:36:07.123]  Yes, I did see last Thursday and Friday that they have now found oil in Georgia beaches and other places.
[02:36:07.123 --> 02:36:11.767]  They were debating whether or not that was oil from the Gulf Spill.
[02:36:11.767 --> 02:36:13.589]  But they've now confirmed it is hitting Texas.
[02:36:13.589 --> 02:36:14.930]  They tried to spin that at first.
[02:36:14.930 --> 02:36:17.352]  It is hitting areas of the East Coast.
[02:36:18.112 --> 02:36:20.314]  Yes sir, I sent you an email about a week ago.
[02:36:20.314 --> 02:36:23.156]  That might have been some of the information you picked up on.
[02:36:23.156 --> 02:36:23.757]  I've got some proof of it.
[02:36:23.757 --> 02:36:25.218]  My wife was on the beach at St.
[02:36:25.218 --> 02:36:25.718]  Simon's Island.
[02:36:41.130 --> 02:36:44.932]  I was just wondering if there was any way I could get it sent to you.
[02:36:44.932 --> 02:36:47.233]  My wife took a couple of pictures of the sign, of St.
[02:36:47.233 --> 02:36:51.296]  Simons, so you'd know that's where it was, but a couple of, like five
[02:37:08.360 --> 02:37:12.261]  Between 5 and 15 second videos.
[02:37:12.261 --> 02:37:16.022]  Okay, send them right now to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com.
[02:37:16.022 --> 02:37:18.663]  Can you send them right now and the guys will get in there?
[02:37:18.663 --> 02:37:19.584]  Okay.
[02:37:19.584 --> 02:37:20.764]  Yes sir, I'll do it.
[02:37:20.764 --> 02:37:21.204]  God bless you.
[02:37:21.204 --> 02:37:22.344]  Anything else?
[02:37:22.344 --> 02:37:23.325]  No sir, that's it.
[02:37:23.325 --> 02:37:24.985]  Alright, thank you.
[02:37:24.985 --> 02:37:27.146]  First you don't succeed to get through to us, try, try again.
[02:37:27.146 --> 02:37:28.606]  That's why I love taking your calls.
[02:37:28.606 --> 02:37:29.827]  Bev in Canada, you're on the air.
[02:37:30.658 --> 02:37:33.159]  Hi Alex, thanks for waking me up in April.
[02:37:33.159 --> 02:37:36.260]  I want to say that, just a quick comment before I ask my question.
[02:37:36.260 --> 02:37:41.042]  Rick Sanchez, what an ignorant, ignorant puppet to the advanced New World Order agenda.
[02:37:41.042 --> 02:37:45.004]  Well for those who just joined us, tell folks what you heard him say.
[02:37:45.004 --> 02:37:50.686]  Well, that killing is a good thing for the New, you know, to advance.
[02:37:50.686 --> 02:37:54.127]  Show us the Muslims really are our enemy.
[02:37:54.127 --> 02:37:54.948]  Come on.
[02:37:54.948 --> 02:37:58.549]  You know, I stopped watching CNN because of their blatant lies a long time ago.
[02:37:59.611 --> 02:38:06.614]  I left a polite comment on Facebook regarding Peter Mansbridge, which is a reporter here in Canada who attended the Bilderberg.
[02:38:06.614 --> 02:38:09.896]  All of a sudden, my account for Facebook just disappeared.
[02:38:09.896 --> 02:38:22.601]  Well, Facebook admits it does censor political speech, even stuff that doesn't violate their Terms of Use Agreement, and the governments have all announced they want to start censoring the web more, so I'm sorry to hear that happen, Bev.
[02:38:22.601 --> 02:38:23.862]  Yeah, well, they're doing it.
[02:38:23.862 --> 02:38:26.823]  I wanted to ask you, Alex, have you read a publication released in 1902, 1903,
[02:38:29.005 --> 02:38:32.468]  It truly outlines the culmination of all the current events.
[02:38:32.468 --> 02:38:35.970]  It's called the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion.
[02:38:35.970 --> 02:38:37.492]  Oh, of course I've read that.
[02:38:37.492 --> 02:38:44.057]  I even bought a copy once because I was in a Walmart probably 15 years ago when they were selling them there.
[02:38:44.057 --> 02:38:47.399]  And the providence of those is questioned.
[02:38:47.399 --> 02:38:53.144]  I mean, did the czars write it to demonize Zionist groups in Russia?
[02:38:53.144 --> 02:38:54.445]  Or are they real?
[02:38:54.445 --> 02:38:58.548]  Whether they're real or not, everything that's in there is what government
[02:38:59.288 --> 02:38:59.628]  I don't
[02:39:17.358 --> 02:39:17.538]  It is.
[02:39:17.538 --> 02:39:17.658]  It is.
[02:39:17.658 --> 02:39:18.860]  Thank you very much, Alex, for taking my call.
[02:39:35.552 --> 02:39:37.072]  All right, I appreciate your call.
[02:39:37.072 --> 02:39:41.233]  You know, I think all information is informative.
[02:39:41.233 --> 02:39:49.915]  I mean, learning and just thinking about how governments manipulate, thinking about how governments and groups and organizations engage in propaganda.
[02:39:49.915 --> 02:39:57.837]  Because, you know, regardless of what's gone on in the past or is happening currently, just by researching, say, Edward Bernays and the book he wrote, Propaganda.
[02:39:57.837 --> 02:39:59.497]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:40:00.517 --> 02:40:02.739]  Uh, and we know he wrote it, he published it.
[02:40:02.739 --> 02:40:07.003]  Uh, or David Rockefeller published a book saying he wants world government and the overthrow of the U.S.
[02:40:07.003 --> 02:40:09.886]  I mean, you know, that is where they admit they've written it.
[02:40:09.886 --> 02:40:13.048]  Uh, so I appreciate, uh, appreciate your call.
[02:40:13.048 --> 02:40:16.051]  Let's go ahead and talk to George in Connecticut.
[02:40:16.051 --> 02:40:16.912]  George, you're on the air.
[02:40:16.912 --> 02:40:25.179]  You're running these, uh, uh, I don't know, weeklies, and why can't you call some of your, uh, friends out there?
[02:40:25.179 --> 02:40:25.840]  Maybe they can, uh,
[02:40:26.836 --> 02:40:31.640]  I'm going to have to let you go, George.
[02:40:31.640 --> 02:40:33.681]  Your Skype or whatever it is is just unintelligible.
[02:40:33.681 --> 02:40:35.202]  I heard you talk about my friends.
[02:40:35.202 --> 02:40:36.283]  That's about all I could get.
[02:40:36.283 --> 02:40:37.124]  Sorry.
[02:40:37.124 --> 02:40:38.545]  Let's talk to Chris in Florida.
[02:40:38.545 --> 02:40:40.867]  Chris, you're on the air.
[02:40:40.867 --> 02:40:52.155]  With the new case of the defector, the Iranian scientist, the nuclear physicist, and his original claim that he was kidnapped and his wife claiming the same thing.
[02:40:52.888 --> 02:41:01.616]  You'd think that if the government or Justice Department were interested in human rights, that they would investigate whether he was, you know, still credible or not.
[02:41:01.616 --> 02:41:03.738]  But, you know, it's reminiscent of Kerbal.
[02:41:03.738 --> 02:41:13.006]  Remember when the Germans warned us it was insane and they came out and let us know after the invasion of Iraq that, yeah, we warned you at the U.S.
[02:41:13.006 --> 02:41:14.988]  that he was insane and incredible.
[02:41:14.988 --> 02:41:19.612]  But, you know, our duplicitousness is just borne out by this Brazilian
[02:41:20.419 --> 02:41:36.045]  A letter to the Brazilian President dated May 17th that contradicts the policy of us on April 20th saying that, yeah, we were for the deal with Brazil and Turkey, the enriched Iranian fissile materials.
[02:41:36.045 --> 02:41:39.627]  And so, you know, it just shows that nobody in our government really ever did want peace.
[02:41:41.704 --> 02:41:55.031]  Well, it's now admitted that this guy who disappeared 14 months ago in Saudi Arabia, this Iranian nuclear physicist, showed up at an embassy and is now wanting to go back to Iran.
[02:41:55.031 --> 02:42:01.175]  My issue is, if they grabbed a scientist and then he wouldn't lie for them, they'd just kill him.
[02:42:01.175 --> 02:42:04.356]  And so I tend to lean towards, but I have no proof of this.
[02:42:04.356 --> 02:42:04.977]  I mean, we don't know.
[02:42:05.797 --> 02:42:06.178]  I don't know.
[02:42:25.569 --> 02:42:26.049]  I don't know.
[02:42:26.049 --> 02:42:30.151]  I mean, I find it very strange they let him go, but stranger things have happened.
[02:42:30.151 --> 02:42:34.634]  And maybe too many people in the government knew he'd been grabbed, so they had to let him go.
[02:42:34.634 --> 02:42:35.795]  Maybe he's telling the truth.
[02:42:35.795 --> 02:42:36.295]  I don't know.
[02:42:36.295 --> 02:42:39.897]  I think we'll find out more in the balance of time, the fullness of time.
[02:42:39.897 --> 02:42:41.317]  Thank you for the call.
[02:42:41.317 --> 02:42:42.538]  Jeremy in Maryland.
[02:42:42.538 --> 02:42:44.839]  Go ahead, quickly.
[02:42:44.839 --> 02:42:45.460]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[02:42:45.460 --> 02:42:46.380]  How are you doing?
[02:42:46.380 --> 02:42:47.020]  Doing all right.
[02:42:47.020 --> 02:42:47.721]  How can I serve you?
[02:42:48.354 --> 02:42:48.834]  Uh, yes, sir.
[02:42:48.834 --> 02:42:57.978]  The reason I'm calling today is I don't know if you guys have heard about the... I don't know if I'm sounding right here, but the Sedaro Mudflow that's in East Java, Indonesia.
[02:42:57.978 --> 02:43:00.699]  Have you guys heard about that?
[02:43:00.699 --> 02:43:04.740]  No, but we'll search engine the Sedaro Mudflow, or Mudflow in Indonesia.
[02:43:04.740 --> 02:43:05.600]  What's going on with the Mudflow?
[02:43:05.600 --> 02:43:07.501]  Alright, well, I'll tell you what's going on here.
[02:43:07.501 --> 02:43:15.264]  In 2006, there was a drilling accident there, and what had happened, and they're blaming the accident on an earthquake.
[02:43:16.118 --> 02:43:27.323]  Approximately 1 million cubic feet of mud are being expelled every day and will continue for the next 30 years and their government is covering it up.
[02:43:28.342 --> 02:43:32.525]  Thanks to Facebook and communication with people that I talk to in Indonesia.
[02:43:32.525 --> 02:43:35.827]  It's a lot similar to what's going on in our country right now.
[02:43:59.723 --> 02:44:08.707]  Yep, it's supposed to be going on for approximately 30 more years.
[02:44:08.707 --> 02:44:14.390]  This mud volcano is supposed to be flowing out of the ground and it was a drilling accident that supposedly caused it.
[02:44:14.390 --> 02:44:18.572]  And... Well, that might dovetail what's happening in the Gulf, because that sure doesn't look like any crude oil I've ever seen.
[02:44:18.572 --> 02:44:20.233]  Most of it coming out looks like mud.
[02:44:20.233 --> 02:44:21.614]  I appreciate your call.
[02:44:21.614 --> 02:44:22.254]  Yeah, there's another one.
[02:44:22.254 --> 02:44:23.215]  Los Angeles Times.
[02:44:23.215 --> 02:44:25.736]  Indonesia's mud volcano flows on.
[02:44:25.736 --> 02:44:26.516]  And that's July...
[02:44:29.551 --> 02:44:33.923]  That's July 10th, 2010, so three days ago confirmed.
[02:44:33.923 --> 02:44:34.624]  Thank you, caller.
[02:44:34.624 --> 02:44:35.587]  That's why I love the calls.
[02:44:35.587 --> 02:44:37.612]  They bring up a lot of issues we haven't gotten to.
[02:44:38.502 --> 02:44:41.664]  Okay, I can't get to the last callers.
[02:44:41.664 --> 02:44:47.669]  I'm sorry, but we've got to be able to finish up now with the news here.
[02:44:47.669 --> 02:44:49.230]  Talk about an endless flow.
[02:44:49.230 --> 02:44:50.751]  We could just take calls for eternity.
[02:44:50.751 --> 02:45:01.019]  So many great listeners out there, but we'll try to get back with Eddie and Scott and others, of course, tomorrow, because I got a bunch of news I need to get to now and cover.
[02:45:01.019 --> 02:45:06.263]  Let me go ahead and start with this stack of news.
[02:45:06.263 --> 02:45:06.804]  And this is a
[02:45:08.137 --> 02:45:09.791]  Public health warning!
[02:45:11.471 --> 02:45:40.945]  If I wanted to do three, four, five, six hours a day, just with mainstream news admitting that cell phones are giving you brain cancer, that sodium fluoride is giving you diabetes and cancer and bone cancer and bone fractures and arthritis, I could spend many hours a day just reporting on the melamine and other toxins in our food coming in from China and food additives that get made in China and then shipped here and put in our food, or 90 plus percent of the vaccines and drugs being made in China, and all the problems are how they're now admitting
[02:45:41.465 --> 02:45:47.070]  Uh, you know, the Prozac's causing brain tumors, uh, heart attacks.
[02:45:47.070 --> 02:45:51.354]  This is just the stuff, without even looking, that I ran into today.
[02:45:51.354 --> 02:45:56.158]  Fox News, FDA panel to review safety of diabetes drug Avandian.
[02:45:57.270 --> 02:46:10.414]  And it goes on to say, of head of hearings, FDA scientists have blasted a study by drug maker GlaxoSmithKline used to defend the safety of the once high-riding diabetes drug, which fell out of favor because of potential ties to heart attacks.
[02:46:10.414 --> 02:46:12.195]  Then it goes into the actual studies.
[02:46:12.195 --> 02:46:13.395]  It's very clear.
[02:46:13.395 --> 02:46:19.538]  In fact, the FDI reviewer said the study actually makes the case against leaving Avandia on the market.
[02:46:19.538 --> 02:46:21.658]  Now, what did that ring a bell with?
[02:46:21.658 --> 02:46:24.379]  Hundreds of other studies.
[02:46:24.379 --> 02:46:26.580]  Over and over and over again, examples of this.
[02:46:29.926 --> 02:46:31.788]  And that brings us to our next story.
[02:46:31.788 --> 02:46:33.429]  We've read these studies on air.
[02:46:33.429 --> 02:46:38.634]  We've had medical doctors and toxicologists on dealing with it.
[02:46:38.634 --> 02:46:41.637]  Aspartame in the 60s was discovered by the Pentagon.
[02:46:41.637 --> 02:46:51.406]  They were working on chemical weapons for a type of E. coli bacteria that could eat toxic chemicals and then secrete a poison.
[02:46:52.475 --> 02:46:54.096]  And they came up with Aspartame.
[02:46:54.096 --> 02:46:59.479]  Searle was then bought by Monsanto in the late 1970s.
[02:46:59.479 --> 02:47:03.602]  And of course, the CEO of that at the time was Donald Rumsfeld.
[02:47:03.602 --> 02:47:08.285]  And they used studies done by Searle to get approval.
[02:47:08.285 --> 02:47:11.067]  It had failed several times to get approval.
[02:47:11.067 --> 02:47:11.907]  And Reagan in 1981
[02:47:14.202 --> 02:47:22.564]  Put the former top scientist of Monsanto over the Food and Drug Administration and they approved Aspartame.
[02:47:22.564 --> 02:47:24.145]  Now, back then it was patented.
[02:47:24.145 --> 02:47:25.905]  The patent hadn't run out.
[02:47:25.905 --> 02:47:30.126]  And it was only in Coke and Pepsi.
[02:47:30.126 --> 02:47:33.067]  And in the little Equal and NutraSweet packages.
[02:47:33.067 --> 02:47:34.487]  Those were the two brand names.
[02:47:34.487 --> 02:47:36.748]  Two licenses were issued for companies.
[02:47:36.748 --> 02:47:38.148]  Coke and Pepsi to put it out.
[02:47:38.148 --> 02:47:41.429]  And then there's sub-directives with Equal and NutraSweet.
[02:47:42.972 --> 02:47:57.280]  And they knew that, and you can go pull these up, the vast majority of the different types of monkeys, they did it in multiple groups, rhesus monkeys, green monkeys, there were several of them, that they fed aspartame to when they were pregnant.
[02:47:57.280 --> 02:48:02.443]  They would have miscarriages, low birth weight, deformities, all sorts of problems in the rhesus monkeys.
[02:48:03.311 --> 02:48:06.673]  Then, they would feed it to control groups.
[02:48:06.673 --> 02:48:10.915]  A smaller amount of aspartame in monkey milk, in the mother's milk.
[02:48:10.915 --> 02:48:12.636]  A larger amount, and then none.
[02:48:12.636 --> 02:48:13.957]  In just one of the studies.
[02:48:13.957 --> 02:48:15.898]  And they would get brain tumors, they would die of cancer.
[02:48:15.898 --> 02:48:16.999]  I mean, the numbers were off the charts.
[02:48:16.999 --> 02:48:18.420]  You can go pull up the studies.
[02:48:18.420 --> 02:48:22.462]  And they used those studies to get it approved.
[02:48:25.083 --> 02:48:26.405]  That's how corrupt the FDA is.
[02:48:43.885 --> 02:48:49.990]  This is what they do over and over and over and over again, and then a decade later, they pull it off the market.
[02:48:49.990 --> 02:48:51.591]  But not with Aspartame and others.
[02:48:51.591 --> 02:48:57.055]  But here's the Mail Online today, and the headline's actually a whitewash.
[02:48:57.055 --> 02:49:00.658]  It says, Do Sweeteners Bring on Early Birth?
[02:49:00.658 --> 02:49:04.821]  How Fizzy Drinks Can Harm an Unborn Child.
[02:49:04.821 --> 02:49:06.282]  Talk about deception.
[02:49:06.282 --> 02:49:08.864]  It's not fizzy drinks that can hurt an unborn child.
[02:49:11.294 --> 02:49:12.334]  It's not fizzy drinks.
[02:49:12.334 --> 02:49:17.096]  It's not carbon dioxide, carbonated water, beverages.
[02:49:17.096 --> 02:49:18.336]  It is the aspartame.
[02:49:18.336 --> 02:49:27.858]  And they later admit research funded by the EU found a correlation between the amount of diet drink consumed and an early birth among the 60,000 women studied.
[02:49:27.858 --> 02:49:33.220]  Many had switched from sugary drinks to those artificial sweeteners, believing they would be healthier.
[02:49:33.220 --> 02:49:33.460]  Option.
[02:49:34.807 --> 02:49:37.909]  And it says Aspartame carried a danger for unborn children.
[02:49:37.909 --> 02:49:40.351]  I mean, of course they already knew this.
[02:49:40.351 --> 02:49:42.993]  And you read the study, it's much worse than the article.
[02:49:42.993 --> 02:49:45.775]  Okay, so that's what we're talking about here.
[02:49:45.775 --> 02:49:49.718]  When I get up here on air and I tell you, because here's the deal.
[02:49:49.718 --> 02:49:50.779]  I keep saying it's in thousands.
[02:49:50.779 --> 02:49:51.800]  I looked it up last night.
[02:49:51.800 --> 02:49:56.604]  It's in over 14,000 current products sold in the United States.
[02:49:56.604 --> 02:49:59.706]  My children in gas stations were on a road trip, begged for candy.
[02:50:01.365 --> 02:50:07.589]  Almost every candy, not just gum, it's sugar gum, sugar lollipops.
[02:50:07.589 --> 02:50:09.771]  It says aspartame on the label.
[02:50:09.771 --> 02:50:13.293]  My cousin was down here from Chicago, great guy, and he was chewing a brand of gum.
[02:50:13.293 --> 02:50:14.014]  I said, that's got aspartame.
[02:50:14.014 --> 02:50:14.654]  He said, no, it doesn't.
[02:50:14.654 --> 02:50:15.355]  I said, give me the pack.
[02:50:15.355 --> 02:50:16.135]  I said, aspartame.
[02:50:16.135 --> 02:50:19.018]  He goes, my gosh, this is a sugar gum.
[02:50:19.018 --> 02:50:23.641]  They found out in the last decade, I mean, I've got a 60-minute program admitting it causes brain damage, and they knew it.
[02:50:23.641 --> 02:50:26.543]  I mean, it's admitted.
[02:50:26.543 --> 02:50:28.244]  And their answer is, oh, you don't like this?
[02:50:28.244 --> 02:50:29.285]  We're gonna put it in everything.
[02:50:30.353 --> 02:50:36.598]  People started getting awake in the last 15 years or so to the cytotoxin that is MSG.
[02:50:36.598 --> 02:50:38.339]  Just totally deadly.
[02:50:38.339 --> 02:50:43.043]  Their answer is they call it yeast extract now in everything you eat.
[02:50:43.043 --> 02:50:46.546]  When you try to avoid this stuff, they just put it in more.
[02:50:46.546 --> 02:50:53.432]  And I'll tell you, aspartame, all this stuff, costs more than regular sweeteners like sugar.
[02:50:53.432 --> 02:50:55.894]  And then of course, why is corn syrup bad?
[02:50:55.894 --> 02:50:59.216]  Because half of the corn syrup out there has mercury in it.
[02:50:59.216 --> 02:50:59.697]  We'll be right back.

[02:52:06.673 --> 02:52:07.954]  Tyranny is here.
[02:52:07.954 --> 02:52:11.817]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:52:11.817 --> 02:52:14.119]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:52:14.119 --> 02:52:19.983]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:52:19.983 --> 02:52:26.228]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:52:26.648 --> 02:52:32.633]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:52:32.633 --> 02:52:36.816]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:52:36.816 --> 02:52:41.100]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:52:41.100 --> 02:52:47.045]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:52:47.045 --> 02:52:50.608]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:52:50.608 --> 02:52:52.569]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:52:52.569 --> 02:52:53.010]  It's here.

[02:53:01.943 --> 02:53:05.484]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:53:05.484 --> 02:53:07.765]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:53:07.765 --> 02:53:08.645]  Don't!
[02:53:08.645 --> 02:53:12.067]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[02:53:12.067 --> 02:53:21.170]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb Kay's number one debt secret.
[02:53:21.170 --> 02:53:24.831]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.

[02:53:40.128 --> 02:53:41.388]  What do you have to lose?
[02:53:41.388 --> 02:53:42.609]  Stop the calls now.
[02:53:42.609 --> 02:53:44.569]  Get out of debt and have more money.
[02:53:44.569 --> 02:53:47.891]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[02:53:47.891 --> 02:53:48.211]  Call 800-405-7850.
[02:53:48.211 --> 02:53:48.591]  That's 800-405-7850.
[02:53:48.591 --> 02:53:48.631]  800-405-7850.
[02:54:08.171 --> 02:54:18.662]  Yeah, if you think NutraSweet is good for you, Aspartame, I got a bridge I want to sell you, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:18.662 --> 02:54:21.785]  This isn't like caffeine or nicotine, folks.
[02:54:21.785 --> 02:54:27.571]  This is much worse.
[02:54:27.571 --> 02:54:29.333]  Care about your family, you better read the labels.
[02:54:31.723 --> 02:54:39.346]  Of course, their answer is, don't let you know what's in it.
[02:54:39.346 --> 02:54:42.967]  Here's an article out of Natural News.
[02:54:42.967 --> 02:54:48.088]  Aspartame has been renamed and is now being marketed as a natural sweetener.
[02:54:48.088 --> 02:54:49.649]  Amino sweet.
[02:54:49.649 --> 02:54:52.110]  You can get whole scoop loads of it.
[02:54:52.110 --> 02:54:52.890]  Amino sweet.
[02:54:54.244 --> 02:55:08.662]  Here's another one, McClatchy Newspapers, and there's a bunch of studies on this, they have a genetically engineered cross-species about to be approved salmon, and the Purdue University study found that if you put 60 transgenetic
[02:55:09.807 --> 02:55:10.727]  That's not even a clone.
[02:55:10.727 --> 02:55:13.328]  It's a mix of species, insect genes.
[02:55:13.328 --> 02:55:15.829]  Fish bred in a population of 60,000 wild fish.
[02:55:15.829 --> 02:55:19.090]  The wild fish will become extinct within 40 generations.
[02:55:19.090 --> 02:55:20.190]  That's within 40 years.
[02:55:20.190 --> 02:55:21.530]  They have one generation a year.
[02:55:21.530 --> 02:55:23.791]  But in a tank, they do it faster.
[02:55:23.791 --> 02:55:27.172]  And it goes on to talk about the advanced hybrid.
[02:55:27.172 --> 02:55:29.373]  So there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:29.373 --> 02:55:36.895]  And of course, all the studies show that this is designed to take over the entire biosphere, to have a corporate monopoly on all life forms.
[02:55:38.598 --> 02:55:41.879]  But I am basically out of time on that subject.
[02:55:41.879 --> 02:55:43.899]  There was another big study out.
[02:55:43.899 --> 02:55:48.060]  Pharmacists give themselves cancer from dispensing toxic chemotherapy chemicals.
[02:55:48.060 --> 02:55:53.202]  All they are is basically pesticides that cost a few dollars, but they sell them for thousands of dollars per treatment.
[02:55:53.202 --> 02:55:57.463]  And just being around it, getting a drop of it on your finger cumulatively, gives you cancer.
[02:55:58.323 --> 02:56:00.025]  Why Pharmacists Are Dying of Cancer.
[02:56:00.025 --> 02:56:01.426]  So enjoy yourselves there.
[02:56:01.426 --> 02:56:06.871]  Then a big article, Depopulation Fanatics, Eugenics' Launch Objective Global Population Study.
[02:56:06.871 --> 02:56:10.954]  That's from Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com with Steve Watson.
[02:56:10.954 --> 02:56:13.537]  Now this subject I'm going to talk more about in days to come.
[02:56:13.537 --> 02:56:15.799]  We're going to get some guests on concerning it.
[02:56:15.799 --> 02:56:20.403]  But every week or so I see a new county, a new city.
[02:56:20.403 --> 02:56:24.386]  Here's one out of Cleveland, Ohio in the county of, how do you pronounce this guys?
[02:56:27.054 --> 02:56:32.395]  Ashtabula, people in Ohio are going to go, get it right, you moron!
[02:56:32.395 --> 02:56:36.396]  A-S-H-T-A-B-L-U-A.
[02:56:36.396 --> 02:56:40.076]  Ashtabula County judge tells residents to arm themselves.
[02:56:40.076 --> 02:56:47.178]  They're cutting the deputies from 112 to 49 deputies and saying almost all the deputies will be used for the prison and for revenue generation.
[02:56:47.178 --> 02:56:50.118]  There'll be one deputy per shift to respond to crime.
[02:56:50.118 --> 02:56:54.559]  So you can pay for 49 deputies and you get three a day because there's one per shift or three shifts a day.
[02:56:55.619 --> 02:56:57.701]  And he's being honest and saying, buy guns.
[02:56:57.701 --> 02:57:00.863]  Now, this isn't just some county in Ohio doing this.
[02:57:00.863 --> 02:57:03.104]  Here is NBC.
[02:57:03.104 --> 02:57:04.625]  Suffer these criminals in Oakland.
[02:57:04.625 --> 02:57:06.607]  Don't call the cops.
[02:57:06.607 --> 02:57:10.610]  And it says, layoffs effective at midnight, barring last minute deals.
[02:57:10.610 --> 02:57:11.570]  So they hold you hostage.
[02:57:11.570 --> 02:57:16.814]  They say, we're not gonna be able to respond to crime if we don't raise your taxes, but all the money's going to the bankers.
[02:57:16.814 --> 02:57:20.817]  Oakland police chief is making some dire claims about his force and will not respond.
[02:57:22.881 --> 02:57:23.041]  To
[02:57:37.841 --> 02:57:39.502]  Almost all the taxes will go to the bankers.
[02:57:39.502 --> 02:57:41.223]  They'll use that to shut off the economy.
[02:57:41.223 --> 02:57:43.664]  Then they'll say, we'll raise taxes or we won't fill the potholes.
[02:57:43.664 --> 02:57:45.185]  We won't get emergency vehicles.
[02:57:45.185 --> 02:57:46.986]  The fire department won't respond.
[02:57:46.986 --> 02:57:48.446]  This is how you're held hostage.
[02:57:48.446 --> 02:57:49.767]  This is the New World Order.
[02:57:49.767 --> 02:57:50.928]  This is austerity.
[02:57:50.928 --> 02:57:52.008]  This is globalization.
[02:57:52.008 --> 02:57:54.790]  This is what they've done all over the world.
[02:57:56.035 --> 02:58:11.718]  Coming up on the streams at InfoWars.com and of course on the satellites and here on the radio show, I'm gonna cover the economy and I'm also going to get into the latest police, state, and military developments coming up here after this quick break.
[02:58:11.718 --> 02:58:17.939]  I briefly wanted to encourage listeners, remember we have the online video bookstore with all the t-shirts, the films, the materials.
[02:58:17.939 --> 02:58:19.999]  America and the world is ready to be awakened.
[02:58:19.999 --> 02:58:21.340]  We have the films that will do it.
[02:58:21.340 --> 02:58:22.820]  We have the films that give people the facts.
[02:58:23.360 --> 02:58:27.002]  And massively discounting it endgame free at InfoWars.com.
[02:58:27.002 --> 02:58:29.003]  Obama Deception, massively discounted.
[02:58:29.003 --> 02:58:31.684]  The Secret of Oz, right now available.
[02:58:31.684 --> 02:58:34.186]  With real solutions to beat these bankers.
[02:58:34.186 --> 02:58:34.966]  Don't tread on me.
[02:58:34.966 --> 02:58:37.347]  Rise of the Republic and take the states and county sheriffs back.
[02:58:37.347 --> 02:58:39.408]  It's all available at InfoWars.com.
[02:58:39.408 --> 02:58:40.529]  God bless everybody out there.
