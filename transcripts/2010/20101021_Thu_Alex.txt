[00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:09.704]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-ups.
[00:00:09.704 --> 00:00:11.285]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.285 --> 00:00:13.207]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.207 --> 00:00:17.009]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:24.094]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.094 --> 00:00:25.395]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:25.395 --> 00:00:30.038]  This is going to be an incredibly informative and powerful transmission today.
[00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:56.840]  We got a call yesterday from Lindsey Williams, literally short of breath, and in the last few days he talked to his former head of a major big three oil company who has attended Bilderberg meetings and such, and the intel he's given us, about 90% of it has turned out to be absolutely accurate, including six months before oil went from $50 a barrel to $149.
[00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:06.028]  Lindsey Williams called it exactly from his source, and then he said it was going to go down, and it went down.
[00:01:06.028 --> 00:01:08.972]  Just total precision on so many fronts.
[00:01:08.972 --> 00:01:17.504]  And he called us, his source is dying, has terminal cancer, and completely spilt his guts to him.
[00:01:19.257 --> 00:01:29.282]  So, and by the way, I know who the person is, Dr. Stan Monteith, checked it for himself and was able to figure it out and called the person a few years ago when all this first broke.
[00:01:29.282 --> 00:01:32.724]  So, Lindsey is certainly telling the truth about this source.
[00:01:32.724 --> 00:01:35.665]  The question is, you know, is somebody feeding the source this info?
[00:01:35.665 --> 00:01:39.768]  And the evidence, unfortunately, shows that they're not.
[00:01:39.768 --> 00:01:48.332]  So, this is amazing what the globalists are planning according to this.
[00:01:51.345 --> 00:02:09.115]  What's coming up with Russia and China, Iran, the mortgages, crude oil, back to 150, $5 a gallon gas within eight months, gold and silver won't slow down, will skyrocket from this point.
[00:02:09.115 --> 00:02:14.398]  And then he has a separate contact that had dinner with Janet Napolitano and what she told him.
[00:02:14.398 --> 00:02:18.220]  She said, get six months of food and water ready now.
[00:02:19.798 --> 00:02:25.743]  So, Lindsey Williams joining us in the next hour.
[00:02:25.743 --> 00:02:31.607]  And coming up in about 12 minutes, 14 minutes from now, we've got Wayne Madsen popping in.
[00:02:31.607 --> 00:02:35.470]  I could have Madsen or Tarpley on this subject, they're both experts.
[00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.374]  So am I, quite frankly, for that matter, studying this over the years, but I wanna get their view on it.
[00:02:40.374 --> 00:02:42.615]  Oh, it's big exclusive!
[00:02:42.615 --> 00:02:45.578]  Big exclusive!
[00:02:45.578 --> 00:02:48.059]  In fact, Paul Watson didn't even toot his horn on this.
[00:02:49.198 --> 00:02:51.780]  I want you to get Watson on the line at the start of the next segment.
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.463]  I want to briefly give him today's directive because I want Paul to toot his horn.
[00:02:57.463 --> 00:02:59.764]  Not that, oh, Paul Watson's great or Alex Jones is great.
[00:02:59.764 --> 00:03:04.487]  We need to point out we already told you this going back four years ago.
[00:03:04.487 --> 00:03:12.752]  We identified this guy as their top Al Qaeda operative controlled by the CIA.
[00:03:12.752 --> 00:03:16.394]  And I mean, he runs everything.
[00:03:16.394 --> 00:03:17.835]  The Fort Hood situation.
[00:03:19.138 --> 00:03:20.839]  The list just goes on and on.
[00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:22.981]  The underwear bomber.
[00:03:22.981 --> 00:03:27.665]  The Times Square dud bomb.
[00:03:27.665 --> 00:03:28.705]  All of it.
[00:03:28.705 --> 00:03:34.310]  He basically finds mentally ill, loose cannon Muslims and then provocateurs them into attacking.
[00:03:36.411 --> 00:03:38.952]  So this isn't a purely staged terror attacks.
[00:03:38.952 --> 00:03:53.939]  This guy acts as the vehicle, and it came out that Congress has been told it's national security, that they can't see all the emails that the threat fusion centers, the feds run, knew for two years that Major Hassan was going to attack and kill.
[00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:59.041]  He thought he was talking to Anwar al-Awlaki, and he was.
[00:03:59.041 --> 00:04:02.163]  And Anwar told him, you know, go ahead and do this attack.
[00:04:02.163 --> 00:04:04.804]  And of course the Pentagon grabbed the surveillance camera,
[00:04:05.424 --> 00:04:06.464]  Footage from 9-11.
[00:04:06.464 --> 00:04:07.604]  Same thing happened in Fort Hood.
[00:04:07.604 --> 00:04:14.546]  They grabbed the surveillance camera footage, people's private tapes, private cell phone videos, ordered it all erased.
[00:04:14.546 --> 00:04:18.186]  And it's always Anwar al-Awlaki.
[00:04:18.186 --> 00:04:19.947]  It's always this guy.
[00:04:19.947 --> 00:04:20.987]  It's always him.
[00:04:20.987 --> 00:04:29.108]  And we told you, every time he's running the patsies, or the dupes, the useful morons.
[00:04:29.108 --> 00:04:30.229]  And here's Fox News.
[00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:31.269]  It's an exclusive.
[00:04:32.305 --> 00:04:36.347]  It's not really an exclusive, we already told you this, but they got the actual documents.
[00:04:36.347 --> 00:04:45.933]  The exclusive Al-Qaeda leader dined at the Pentagon just months after 9-11, even though they'd already fingered him in the media as one of the masterminds of 9-11.
[00:04:45.933 --> 00:04:48.014]  And it's always the same.
[00:04:48.014 --> 00:04:53.477]  These guys, Al-Qaeda is 100% CIA command operation.
[00:04:53.477 --> 00:04:58.340]  Sometimes they purely stage attacks or they find useful idiots, but they're being funded by these people.
[00:05:01.354 --> 00:05:05.376]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:05:05.376 --> 00:05:08.617]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:05:08.617 --> 00:05:13.399]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:19.802]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:05:19.802 --> 00:05:22.043]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:05:22.583 --> 00:05:22.883]  Tim Geithner?
[00:05:22.883 --> 00:05:23.403]  Bernanke?
[00:05:23.403 --> 00:05:24.063]  They're arsonists!
[00:05:24.063 --> 00:05:25.344]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:05:25.344 --> 00:05:27.584]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:05:41.488 --> 00:05:48.755]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:05:48.755 --> 00:05:57.883]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:04.472]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:04.472 --> 00:06:05.372]  Number 1.
[00:06:05.372 --> 00:06:08.795]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:08.795 --> 00:06:09.655]  Number 2.
[00:06:09.655 --> 00:06:14.558]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:14.558 --> 00:06:15.299]  It's true.
[00:06:15.299 --> 00:06:20.162]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:20.162 --> 00:06:21.002]  Number 3.
[00:06:21.002 --> 00:06:24.585]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:24.585 --> 00:06:28.287]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:28.487 --> 00:06:29.288]  Number 4.
[00:06:29.288 --> 00:06:32.031]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:32.031 --> 00:06:35.715]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:35.715 --> 00:06:36.516]  Number 5.
[00:06:36.516 --> 00:06:40.661]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:40.661 --> 00:06:45.426]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:07:03.959 --> 00:07:10.360]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:17.741]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:07:17.741 --> 00:07:22.622]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:33.608]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[00:07:58.529 --> 00:08:00.551]  Thank you.
[00:08:00.551 --> 00:08:03.313]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.313 --> 00:08:06.096]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:11.175 --> 00:08:25.292]  Okay, coming up in about five minutes, we're going to have a former member of the National Security Agency, Naval Intelligence, writes for some of the biggest publications in the country, Wayne Madsen's going to pop in on Anwar al-Awlaki.
[00:08:27.321 --> 00:08:37.556]  I hear the media pronounce it two different ways, but we've been covering him for at least five years as the key CIA, Al-Qaeda handler.
[00:08:37.556 --> 00:08:42.123]  And it doesn't matter if it's the underwear bombing, the Times Square attempted bombing, the Fort Hood shooting.
[00:08:42.964 --> 00:08:47.226]  It's always this guy running the operation and being protected.
[00:08:47.226 --> 00:08:49.247]  And here's the Fox News headline.
[00:08:49.247 --> 00:08:50.327]  Exclusive!
[00:08:50.327 --> 00:08:55.490]  Al-Qaeda leader dined at the Pentagon just months after 9-11.
[00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:56.670]  Again, headline.
[00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:00.272]  Al-Qaeda leader dined at the Pentagon just months after 9-11.
[00:09:02.543 --> 00:09:15.312]  And over the last five years, we have written multiple articles yearly at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com fingering him directly and proving that he is a CIA operative.
[00:09:15.312 --> 00:09:21.476]  And so we have the new headline out at PrisonPlanet.com today, two articles by Paul Watson.
[00:09:21.476 --> 00:09:23.638]  Al-Qaeda is a front group for the U.S.
[00:09:23.638 --> 00:09:26.180]  military-industrial complex, and then it goes through
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.341]  Amad Salam.
[00:09:28.341 --> 00:09:38.304]  It goes through David Headley, which is now mainstream news, reportedly commanding the Mumbai attacks.
[00:09:38.304 --> 00:09:43.486]  We've got Prince Bandar Bush and his comments about Osama bin Laden being admitted.
[00:09:43.486 --> 00:09:44.927]  CIA.
[00:09:44.927 --> 00:09:52.790]  Rashid Aswad masterminding the 7-7 and it came out mainstream news that he was MI6 and being protected.
[00:09:53.638 --> 00:10:18.546]  And so there's purely staged events like Gulf of Tonkin, or 9-11, or Operation Ajax, or other battle plans that they didn't implement, like Operation Northwoods or USS Liberty, which was implemented, but then there's other events where you have the Western intelligence agencies, MI6 does it, Mossad engages in it, Germans engage in it, the US has been caught over and over again, and they go out and find
[00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:21.392]  Clan groups in the U.S.
[00:10:21.392 --> 00:10:31.075]  that came out in Texas Monthly back in 1998, that the FBI had created a clan group and tried to get them to blow stuff up, but they couldn't get them to do it, so they still busted them for it.
[00:10:31.075 --> 00:10:34.335]  I mean, you see this over and over and over again.
[00:10:34.335 --> 00:10:42.377]  But this particular Anwar al-Awlaki, he is just one of the most important ones involved in this.
[00:10:42.377 --> 00:10:44.938]  And there it is, hidden in plain view.
[00:10:46.499 --> 00:10:57.846]  That he met at the Pentagon a couple months after 9-11 with the highest level brass at the event.
[00:10:57.846 --> 00:11:06.472]  With the Central Intelligence Agency and with the head of the Army and others.
[00:11:06.472 --> 00:11:10.494]  Okay, so this guy is in secret meetings with the top brass.
[00:11:10.494 --> 00:11:11.275]  The top brass.
[00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:24.583]  He's in secret meetings with them, and then we fast forward nine years later, every year since 9-11, he is out there running moron groups.
[00:11:24.583 --> 00:11:30.329]  Muslim extremists, morons, that they can find and set up, and, you know, you take the underwear bomber.
[00:11:31.889 --> 00:11:33.330]  We have the witnesses on the plane.
[00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:34.630]  The FBI now admits it.
[00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:35.871]  An unnamed U.S.
[00:11:35.871 --> 00:11:37.191]  intelligence agency.
[00:11:37.191 --> 00:11:46.915]  The Deputy Secretary of the State Department admitted two months after we broke it here with eyewitnesses and the FBI tried to deny it and went to the lawyers.
[00:11:48.836 --> 00:12:01.827]  Law firm and tried to tell him to you know that that that that he saw incorrectly and they tried to intimidate other witnesses That here's the underwear bomber looking drugged looking out of his mind Disheveled he has no passport.
[00:12:01.827 --> 00:12:12.597]  He has no visa He can hardly talk and a sharp-dressed man argues with the people at the gate Because he doesn't even have you know any of the stuff to board
[00:12:13.809 --> 00:12:17.298]  And then orders them, you're gonna let him on the plane.
[00:12:17.298 --> 00:12:20.185]  This guy had so much power, he could order the airport.
[00:12:22.108 --> 00:12:25.711]  In Amsterdam, to put him on the aircraft.
[00:12:25.711 --> 00:12:33.277]  And then it comes out, this is 100% admitted, that the State Department was ordered to quote, help him get on the plane.
[00:12:33.277 --> 00:12:38.101]  So you've got the US State Department clearly at the gate, getting him through security.
[00:12:38.101 --> 00:12:41.103]  By the way, they had naked body scanners in beforehand at that airport.
[00:12:41.103 --> 00:12:42.605]  He gets to bypass those.
[00:12:42.605 --> 00:12:44.006]  He doesn't have a visa.
[00:12:44.006 --> 00:12:45.427]  He doesn't have a passport.
[00:12:45.427 --> 00:12:47.609]  He is obviously drugged out of his gourd.
[00:12:48.988 --> 00:12:55.812]  There are operatives all over the plane videotaping him the entire flight.
[00:12:55.812 --> 00:13:01.536]  They pull everybody off the plane afterwards in Detroit, say that there's bombs, pull everybody out, then they try to cover that up.
[00:13:01.536 --> 00:13:02.936]  It turns out that's a lie.
[00:13:02.936 --> 00:13:04.217]  This was a drill!
[00:13:04.217 --> 00:13:15.064]  And they had some doped-up idiot, and then they put out on television a fake Al-Qaeda video of the underwear bomber with a machine gun at a North African Al-Qaeda training base.
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:26.684]  And they show him, and it looks like... Obi-Wan Kenobi in Empire Strikes Back when he's a ghost.
[00:13:26.684 --> 00:13:27.964]  I mean, it's shimmering.
[00:13:27.964 --> 00:13:29.585]  It's so fake.
[00:13:29.585 --> 00:13:32.906]  I mean, a 10-year-old with video editing software could do this.
[00:13:32.906 --> 00:13:39.449]  It's clearly a face they project into somebody else's hood, and the CIA admits they put out fake videos.
[00:13:39.449 --> 00:13:42.090]  So, it's 100% staged.
[00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:42.650]  Okay?
[00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:44.711]  You've got, even if you can believe the official story,
[00:13:47.739 --> 00:13:49.200]  It just makes me sick.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:55.425]  Even if you believe the official Fort Hood story, for two years they knew he was planning this and protected him.
[00:13:55.425 --> 00:14:02.270]  Now, we're going to go over all of this in this hour, and we've got huge breaking news with Lindsey Williams, who's very shaken up, joining us.
[00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:06.273]  His source is dying of terminal cancer, so spilt his guts completely.
[00:14:06.273 --> 00:14:10.336]  So that's coming up, and huge revelations if this is accurate.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:15.572]  I have no reason to believe it isn't, but I briefly wanted to bring Paul Watson up just for a couple minutes.
[00:14:15.572 --> 00:14:17.478]  Paul, I know in your articles about this...
[00:14:18.576 --> 00:14:20.157]  Al-Qaeda is a front group for the U.S.
[00:14:20.157 --> 00:14:22.439]  military-industrial complex.
[00:14:22.439 --> 00:14:30.704]  In your first article of the day, Al-Qaeda mastermind invited the Pentagon after 9-11, and this is down in a leaked report to Fox News.
[00:14:30.704 --> 00:14:45.194]  The documents exclusively obtained by Fox News, including an FBI interview conducted after the Fort Hood shooting in November of 2009, state that al-Awlaki was taken to the Pentagon as part of a military outreach to the Muslim community in the immediate aftermath of the attacks.
[00:14:45.834 --> 00:14:49.617]  And met with the senior leadership of the Pentagon and the CIA.
[00:14:49.617 --> 00:14:57.803]  I mean, it's the same story with the MI6, Al Qaeda, Mastermind of 7-7, mainstream British news.
[00:14:57.803 --> 00:14:59.845]  And you've got links to all of this.
[00:14:59.845 --> 00:15:03.207]  The underwear bomber, the Times Square bomber.
[00:15:03.207 --> 00:15:14.836]  I mean, it's just always, they find mentally ill people, they set them up to carry out these attacks that are always ridiculously weak, because they're such morons, and it mirrors
[00:15:15.336 --> 00:15:15.456]  Well,
[00:15:34.508 --> 00:15:35.730]  You were supposed to bust them.
[00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:36.892]  First, it wasn't going to be a real bomb.
[00:15:36.892 --> 00:15:41.140]  Then it was a real bomb for court, you know, to make it the conviction stick.
[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:45.968]  He thought they were setting him up, which they were as he recorded the FBI telling him, go ahead with the bombing.
[00:15:45.968 --> 00:15:47.291]  And that's now been released in public.
[00:15:48.504 --> 00:15:48.684]  So
[00:16:07.589 --> 00:16:12.471]  Mentally retarded people working there at his mosque and the FBI sets all this up.
[00:16:12.471 --> 00:16:15.732]  I mean, it's the same story over and over again.
[00:16:15.732 --> 00:16:32.459]  Paul Watson, we're bringing up here in just a moment Wayne Madsen to break down the history of this, but I think it's important in your article, you link to all our old stories about it, but I think it's important to point out that we've been on top of this from day one just so people understand this is a public secret.
[00:16:32.459 --> 00:16:32.999]  Paul Watson.
[00:16:34.625 --> 00:16:35.707]  Yeah, Alex.
[00:16:35.707 --> 00:16:37.910]  All the stories linked in the article.
[00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:39.032]  The backstory is...
[00:16:40.529 --> 00:16:55.876]  This Iraqi guy was the preacher, not only for Hassan, the Fort Hood shooter, but also the very 9-11 hijackers that are charged with hijacking Flight 77 and flying it into the Pentagon.
[00:16:55.876 --> 00:16:56.976]  That's right!
[00:16:56.976 --> 00:17:04.760]  I forgot the big one, and here he is a couple months later at the Pentagon, meeting with the heads of the military branches and the CIA.
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.781]  I mean, how sick does this have to get, Watson?
[00:17:07.605 --> 00:17:12.751]  So he's there with Hassan and he's there with the 9-11 patsies before 9-11.
[00:17:12.751 --> 00:17:20.940]  Months later he's meeting at the Pentagon and then immediately before the 4-HUD shooting he's communicating and directing Hassan.
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:26.606]  So every step of the way, I mean the Times Square bombing, the Christmas Day attempted bombing.
[00:17:27.558 --> 00:17:33.044]  Every single one of them was directed by this guy who was meeting with Pentagon officials.
[00:17:33.044 --> 00:17:41.133]  And then we've got five years ago, the 7-7, we've got this other individual, Mainstream News, MI6, being protected, running the whole thing.
[00:17:42.242 --> 00:17:47.927]  Exactly and that's Aswat, Harun Rashid Aswat.
[00:17:47.927 --> 00:17:57.095]  Not only was he fingered as the mastermind of 7-7 having worked for MI6 in Kosovo like Bin Laden and Al Qaeda did.
[00:17:57.615 --> 00:18:09.044]  But after, after the 7-7 bombings, the terror expert John Loftus went on Fox News and said the British MI6 colluded to hide Aswar after the bombings.
[00:18:09.044 --> 00:18:12.487]  So it's not as if he's some double agent gone rogue.
[00:18:12.487 --> 00:18:15.749]  After the bombings that he masterminded, they were still protecting him.
[00:18:15.749 --> 00:18:18.271]  Well, I mean, who set up Al Qaeda in the 80s?
[00:18:18.271 --> 00:18:18.631]  British?
[00:18:19.532 --> 00:18:20.794]  U.S.
[00:18:20.794 --> 00:18:25.440]  and Israeli intelligence, that's not denied, and your article is so powerful.
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:28.123]  Al Qaeda is a front group for the U.S.
[00:18:28.123 --> 00:18:30.947]  military-industrial complex.
[00:18:30.947 --> 00:18:34.251]  This article needs to get out to everybody, but Paul, your headline is excellent.
[00:18:35.775 --> 00:18:39.397]  Al Qaeda mastermind invited to Pentagon after 9-11.
[00:18:39.397 --> 00:18:54.306]  But I mean, I think it's important because you mentioned it, but we should maybe even on the Infowars version of this have Nemo change the headline to say 9-11 mastermind invited to Pentagon after 9-11.
[00:18:54.306 --> 00:18:58.309]  I mean, this is so brazen how they hide it right out in the open, Paul.
[00:19:00.083 --> 00:19:03.564]  Well, I mean, take Prince Bandar Bush, for example.
[00:19:03.564 --> 00:19:09.366]  I mean, this is a guy who George W. Bush consulted before he invaded Iraq in 2003.
[00:19:09.366 --> 00:19:13.228]  He's also big buddies with H.W.
[00:19:13.228 --> 00:19:13.928]  Bush.
[00:19:13.928 --> 00:19:18.749]  And then later on, he's the, quote, de facto leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq.
[00:19:18.749 --> 00:19:21.771]  He's responsible for terrorists killing U.S.
[00:19:21.771 --> 00:19:22.871]  troops, which, of course,
[00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:27.654]  Give them the perfect justification to remain as an occupying force in the country.
[00:19:27.654 --> 00:19:41.322]  Not only that, he later threatened Britain with another 7-7 bombing unless Tony Blair squashed an investigation into corrupt Saudi arms deal, which, you know, that's exactly what happened after.
[00:19:41.582 --> 00:19:45.123]  All these people just count on the public being ignorant.
[00:19:45.123 --> 00:19:51.046]  Let me give all these threat fusion centers around the country who are looking for terrorists, look at your bosses above you and you'll find them.
[00:19:51.046 --> 00:19:52.706]  Paul Watson, great job.
[00:19:52.706 --> 00:19:57.168]  We're going to come back with Wayne Madsen, who's an expert in this area, on the other side.
[00:19:57.168 --> 00:19:58.728]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.

[00:21:00.031 --> 00:21:04.995]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:21:04.995 --> 00:21:05.996]  What have we got?
[00:21:05.996 --> 00:21:08.438]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:21:08.438 --> 00:21:09.438]  A republic.
[00:21:09.438 --> 00:21:12.100]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:14.362]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:21:14.362 --> 00:21:16.384]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:21:16.384 --> 00:21:18.065]  So they think they own our land?
[00:21:18.065 --> 00:21:19.386]  They think they own our water?
[00:21:19.386 --> 00:21:19.986]  Children?
[00:21:19.986 --> 00:21:21.107]  Our education?
[00:21:21.107 --> 00:21:21.948]  Our money?
[00:21:21.948 --> 00:21:25.591]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:21:25.951 --> 00:21:29.657]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:21:29.657 --> 00:21:30.919]  You're being warned.
[00:21:30.919 --> 00:21:31.940]  We have the facts.

[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:48.861]  Don't tread on me.

[00:22:00.168 --> 00:22:04.234]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:22:04.234 --> 00:22:10.143]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:22:10.143 --> 00:22:11.244]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:22:11.244 --> 00:22:15.290]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:22:15.931 --> 00:22:29.736]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:22:29.736 --> 00:22:35.338]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.

[00:22:59.352 --> 00:23:02.717]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:23:02.717 --> 00:23:06.642]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:23:06.642 --> 00:23:10.368]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:23:10.368 --> 00:23:15.295]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water.

[00:24:12.412 --> 00:24:21.116]  Cyrus Jones from 1810 to 1913 made his great-grandchildren believe you could live to 103.
[00:24:21.116 --> 00:24:28.699]  103 is forever when you're just a little kid.
[00:24:28.699 --> 00:24:32.081]  So, Cyrus Jones lived forever.
[00:24:35.157 --> 00:24:36.378]  We are back live.
[00:24:36.378 --> 00:24:44.700]  Now, remember on the morning of 9-11, the London Guardian reported that they were having a Carlisle group meeting in D.C.
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:45.761]  and George Bush Sr.
[00:24:45.761 --> 00:24:48.301]  was at the table with the Bin Laden family.
[00:24:48.301 --> 00:25:00.585]  Remember they flew the Bin Ladens out to safety, then said it was a conspiracy theory, and then later had to admit it because Florida television aimed cameras, when all other air traffic was grounded for two days, they were allowed to take off.
[00:25:02.202 --> 00:25:29.230]  And now we know Anwar al-Awlaki, one of the masterminds of 9-11, on record they say, and the guy who ran the 7, involved in the 7-7, the guy involved in the Fort Hood, the guy supposedly running the underwear bombing, he is always involved in everything, and then Fox News gets a document that a couple months after 9-11 he was at a high-powered meeting
[00:25:30.396 --> 00:25:43.121]  Anwar al-Awlaki may be the first American on CIA's kill or capture list, but he was also a lunch guest of military brass at the Pentagon within months of September 11, 2001 terror attacks, Fox News has learned.
[00:25:43.121 --> 00:25:56.226]  Documents exclusively obtained by Fox News, including an FBI interview conducted after the Fort Hood shooting in November 2009, state that Awlaki was taken to the Pentagon as part of the military's outreach to the Muslim community in the immediate aftermath of the attacks.
[00:25:56.826 --> 00:26:01.417]  And then they have a link to the documents and later we'll go to this article and then link on the documents.
[00:26:01.417 --> 00:26:04.124]  I want to show those on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:26:06.798 --> 00:26:13.362]  It just goes on to how he met with the Secretary of the Army and others at this meeting.
[00:26:13.362 --> 00:26:16.244]  Wayne Madsen, of course, worked for the NSA.
[00:26:16.244 --> 00:26:19.826]  He worked for the Navy.
[00:26:19.826 --> 00:26:21.507]  He worked at every level.
[00:26:21.507 --> 00:26:26.370]  He's written for you name it, BBC, Washington Post.
[00:26:28.539 --> 00:26:31.262]  I mean, the list goes on and on, and he's one of the leading experts on this.
[00:26:31.262 --> 00:26:32.223]  This is a short segment.
[00:26:32.223 --> 00:26:34.306]  We'll have him in the long segment coming up.
[00:26:34.306 --> 00:26:39.952]  But they're going to have trouble spinning this, Wayne, and I wonder why they're releasing this now.
[00:26:39.952 --> 00:26:45.358]  Because if you and I know he's one of the main terror handlers, then the government knows this.
[00:26:45.358 --> 00:26:46.400]  Why is this coming out now?
[00:26:47.287 --> 00:26:53.451]  Well, I'm always intrigued when Fox News releases something that is interesting.
[00:26:53.451 --> 00:27:06.860]  Remember, it was also Fox News that broadcast the series on the role of the Israeli art students and the movers on 9-11 in New York and New Jersey.
[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:11.683]  And now they've come out with this other bombshell.
[00:27:11.683 --> 00:27:14.385]  I'm not sure whether they're trying to cover the other side.
[00:27:17.627 --> 00:27:18.208]  I don't think so.
[00:27:35.021 --> 00:27:37.703]  I think a lot of this stuff was out there.
[00:27:37.703 --> 00:27:48.892]  I think what's interesting about Alaki being at the Pentagon, does this have something to do with the Pentagon pulping Tony Schaefer's book?
[00:27:48.892 --> 00:27:53.236]  Because we know that he was involved in Naval Danger and another subset of that.
[00:27:53.576 --> 00:27:54.737]  Oh, good point!
[00:27:54.737 --> 00:27:55.197]  Good point.
[00:27:55.197 --> 00:27:57.618]  I wonder who may have leaked this, hmm?
[00:27:57.618 --> 00:27:59.399]  Yes, yes.
[00:27:59.399 --> 00:28:12.204]  And, you know, we don't know everything about Able Danger, but what we do know is that the military, the Defense Intelligence Agency, had some of the so-called people involved with the hijacking surrounded.
[00:28:12.204 --> 00:28:17.946]  Then they had, you know, another group called Doorhawk Galley, which was monitoring the monitors, apparently.
[00:28:17.946 --> 00:28:21.728]  And I would not be surprised if it turns out that Awlaki,
[00:28:22.448 --> 00:28:27.753]  From my analysis, he is clearly a CIA master handler of organic lunatics.
[00:28:38.482 --> 00:28:45.069]  And this is the variety of terror where they just basically provoke a turret and open the door and encourage.
[00:28:45.069 --> 00:28:50.355]  And you notice these lunatics always attack at a politically opportune time for the control grid.
[00:28:50.355 --> 00:28:52.497]  Do you agree that that's basically his M.O.? ?
[00:28:53.399 --> 00:29:09.169]  Oh yeah, and I don't think it's any different than the recent revelation about David Headley, who was the guy accused of being involved in the Mumbai attacks, where they said, his wife said, hey look, you know, is he working for you guys?
[00:29:09.169 --> 00:29:21.276]  And, you know, we know that he was an informant for the DEA, I've written that he also worked for the CIA, and he's been casing places all over Indian Pakistan for terrorist attacks.
[00:29:21.276 --> 00:29:22.917]  And I think this is just another example.
[00:29:24.286 --> 00:29:24.987]  All right, stay there.
[00:29:24.987 --> 00:29:40.337]  Let's break down Anwar al-Awlaki on the other side, and Aswad, and some of these other characters, because, I mean, there is no doubt, ladies and gentlemen, that Saudi Arabia works for British, Israeli, and U.S.
[00:29:40.337 --> 00:29:46.021]  intelligence, and they are providing at least the decoy patsies for the state's terror attacks.
[00:29:46.021 --> 00:29:50.504]  Then the state's terror attacks are used to take the liberties of Westerners.
[00:29:50.504 --> 00:29:51.905]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.905 --> 00:29:53.407]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.415 --> 00:29:57.081]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:00.143 --> 00:31:03.726]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:31:03.726 --> 00:31:04.847]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:31:04.847 --> 00:31:09.411]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:31:09.411 --> 00:31:15.357]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:31:15.357 --> 00:31:17.518]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:31:17.518 --> 00:31:20.201]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.

[00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:13.210]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[00:32:15.799 --> 00:32:20.463]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans.

[00:32:33.554 --> 00:32:36.617]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[00:32:38.608 --> 00:32:40.750]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:42.531]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[00:32:57.121 --> 00:32:59.863]  Others don't.
[00:32:59.863 --> 00:33:04.867]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:09.082 --> 00:33:14.363]  It's not just words when we get up there and say 9-11 was an inside job, okay?
[00:33:14.363 --> 00:33:16.843]  I wish it wasn't an inside job.
[00:33:16.843 --> 00:33:19.764]  But the entire official story's been proven to be a lie.
[00:33:19.764 --> 00:33:23.805]  Six of the ten commissioners have come out and said there's a criminal cover-up and a fraud.
[00:33:23.805 --> 00:33:34.847]  We've got Panetta, the head of the transportation agency, in the bunker with Cheney, watching him order the stand-down at the Pentagon.
[00:33:36.829 --> 00:33:38.230]  We've got it all.
[00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:39.091]  We've got it all.
[00:33:39.091 --> 00:33:46.258]  I mean, it's just how the buildings fell, the police saying get back, they're gonna blow 7-Up, the firefighter tapes.
[00:33:46.258 --> 00:33:47.319]  The whole thing's a lie!
[00:33:48.462 --> 00:33:50.984]  And Wade Madsen of Wade Madsen Report is our guest.
[00:33:50.984 --> 00:34:00.553]  I want to get into all of this with you, Wayne, and bring up WikiLeaks and a few other issues with you and some of the new developments on that front.
[00:34:00.553 --> 00:34:07.139]  But why would the CIA come out three months ago in a spy talk
[00:34:08.177 --> 00:34:08.457]  Yeah.
[00:34:26.238 --> 00:34:26.318]  It's
[00:34:52.597 --> 00:34:55.718]  Let me try to answer my own question and have you answer it from your perspective.
[00:34:55.718 --> 00:35:19.144]  They know this is all out in the open, and so for those of us that are awake, and for good people inside government who are awake, and people in industry who are awake, the system's saying, yeah, we're terrorists, as just a way to brazenly terrorize everybody psychologically, and to further inoculate the brain-dead public, so as this stuff comes out, it's really not news anymore because they've already admitted it and hid it in plain view.
[00:35:19.144 --> 00:35:20.104]  What's your view, Wayne Madsen?
[00:35:20.484 --> 00:35:22.205]  Well, that's what I believe.
[00:35:22.205 --> 00:35:32.269]  I believe that the people who watch Fox News basically won't even understand the impact of this revelation because they don't know the other part.
[00:35:32.269 --> 00:35:34.370]  They obviously don't know about Abel Danger.
[00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:43.434]  They don't know about the Bin Laden meeting with Bush and Carlucci and the other Carlisle group people at the Ritz Carlton Hotel on the morning of 9-11 before the
[00:35:44.794 --> 00:35:49.195]  First plane even hit the tower in New York.
[00:35:49.195 --> 00:35:53.756]  So I think this is some sort of a conditioning process.
[00:35:53.756 --> 00:36:05.198]  But, you know, this follows just a day after, two days maybe after Fox and CNN both reported that Bin Laden was hiding in a house somewhere in northern Pakistan.
[00:36:05.198 --> 00:36:07.719]  I noticed they pulled that.
[00:36:07.719 --> 00:36:09.659]  You can't even hardly find it now on the web.
[00:36:09.659 --> 00:36:12.820]  But I mean, what a ludicrous, I mean, the Pakistani said it's ludicrous.
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:15.942]  But, you know, here we have Bin Laden still alive.
[00:36:15.942 --> 00:36:25.969]  The only footage we have of Bin Laden that's legitimate is the one with him coming out of a cave in Afghanistan, and that's circa 1999, I suppose.
[00:36:25.969 --> 00:36:29.231]  It's dated stock footage.
[00:36:29.231 --> 00:36:30.813]  But we haven't really seen anything.
[00:36:30.813 --> 00:36:33.775]  We've seen a fake Bin Laden after 9-11, you know, the guy that...
[00:36:34.375 --> 00:36:38.216]  Doesn't look like him and put on several pounds that we're told with bin Laden.
[00:36:38.216 --> 00:36:59.422]  Well remember three years ago it came out in British news that when they released you know the surfaced video of three of the hijackers at an Al Qaeda training base and then there was a footnote a week later oh that was computer animated with video of them put into old videos of bin Laden for a made-for-tv movie in England.
[00:36:59.422 --> 00:37:01.063]  I mean they think we're so dumb
[00:37:02.392 --> 00:37:14.901]  Right, and I also recall the one where Bin Laden was giving a speech and it only moved on and where his lips, it looked like one of the old Clutch Cargo cartoons, where the only lips were moving.
[00:37:14.901 --> 00:37:21.665]  Well, they put another one out that is that standard program anybody can buy that they use in a lot of video games.
[00:37:21.665 --> 00:37:28.790]  It's basically the same template they use in the movie Final Fantasy, where everybody basically looks the same, they just change a few features.
[00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:30.712]  One of the videos was clearly
[00:37:32.093 --> 00:37:41.017]  Oh, and I think this is all part of the PSYOPS operation.
[00:37:41.017 --> 00:37:52.603]  Once again, we find out that the Army PSYOPS has placed their people in newspapers in Savannah, Georgia and in Raleigh, North Carolina.
[00:37:52.603 --> 00:37:55.625]  It's the Pentagon that basically is dictating.
[00:37:56.125 --> 00:37:56.586]  I don't think so.
[00:38:13.545 --> 00:38:20.009]  And the people in the telecom business and the movers before and during and after.
[00:38:20.009 --> 00:38:24.052]  Urban moving systems, but you notice they did three reports on that and never touched it again.
[00:38:24.052 --> 00:38:31.797]  In my gut, I think this is some type of high-level blackmail brinksmanship going on, I guess, with Fox licenses or something.
[00:38:31.797 --> 00:38:34.979]  I'm not sure, but I mean, I think this is really high-level brinksmanship.
[00:38:35.937 --> 00:38:38.019]  It very well could be.
[00:38:38.019 --> 00:38:49.469]  But, you know, this whole thing, again, it doesn't come as any great shock to me because, remember, if a lock is in the Pentagon in those months, who is running the Pentagon?
[00:38:49.469 --> 00:38:56.415]  Donald Rumsfeld and the neocon, the neocon unit that they placed in there, Douglas Blythe and the rest of these guys.
[00:38:56.415 --> 00:38:59.298]  The Office of Special Plans and Admitted Israeli Operation.
[00:38:59.898 --> 00:39:01.680]  Absolutely.
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:12.388]  So that, you know, how did this... They can't say it was an oversight because, no, I remember covering the Iraq, the invasion of Iraq at the Pentagon.
[00:39:12.388 --> 00:39:22.135]  It was not an easy place to get into and now they're trying to tell this guy affiliate with Al-Qaeda got in and then had, you know, dined with the general.
[00:39:22.135 --> 00:39:24.177]  Well, he dined with the Secretary of the Army.
[00:39:26.865 --> 00:39:35.914]  Well, maybe he also got a congratulatory handshake and a nice bonus for his previous work.
[00:39:35.914 --> 00:39:42.480]  Because at the time, they're saying he was involved at the highest levels of the 9-11 attack, and then he struts in, Hey, Secretary!
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:43.361]  I'm ready to have dinner!
[00:39:43.361 --> 00:39:44.422]  And they're like, Ha ha!
[00:39:44.422 --> 00:39:45.744]  High five, baby!
[00:39:45.744 --> 00:39:46.184]  Woo!
[00:39:46.184 --> 00:39:46.525]  Yeah!
[00:39:47.392 --> 00:39:55.758]  Yeah, I mean, now we know he was also linked to the underwear bomber and the Fizzle, the Times Square Fizzle bomber.
[00:39:55.758 --> 00:40:03.022]  I mean, you know, and remember the reaction of these two guys on the airplanes when they arrested them.
[00:40:03.022 --> 00:40:05.384]  You know, they were very lackadaisical about the whole thing.
[00:40:05.444 --> 00:40:12.006]  Well, the witnesses described when they got the underwear bomber on the plane in Amsterdam that he was disheveled, looked drugged, and had no papers.
[00:40:12.006 --> 00:40:14.887]  Just like, literally a homeless mental patient.
[00:40:14.887 --> 00:40:18.648]  And whoever this sharp-dressed guy was like, look, you're putting him on the plane.
[00:40:18.648 --> 00:40:20.709]  And whoever it was had such authority.
[00:40:20.709 --> 00:40:23.930]  And then it comes out, State Department was ordered by an unnamed U.S.
[00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:26.170]  intelligence agency to get him on the plane.
[00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:27.071]  Well, there we go.
[00:40:27.071 --> 00:40:31.252]  So, as you have said, this is all hiding in plain sight.
[00:40:32.683 --> 00:40:49.428]  Obviously, now we know why the 9-11 Commission, people like Zelikow and the other clowns they had working on that commission, did not give full access to everything to the people who were demanding it, including the two chairmen of the Commission and the other members.
[00:40:49.428 --> 00:41:01.552]  These were the tidbits, obviously, that they didn't want to have come out then, because it would have ruined the whole precept about 9-11, that they had sold not only the American people, but tried to sell the world.
[00:41:01.792 --> 00:41:05.368]  Wayne, let me ask you this, and then we'll get to a few other questions and let you go because I know you're busy.
[00:41:07.915 --> 00:41:12.017]  Just in two minutes from, I mean, we know the official story is a lie.
[00:41:12.017 --> 00:41:18.760]  We know that PNAC called for big terror attacks to be blamed on foreign enemies, just a retread of Northwood's.
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:23.482]  But when you look at this, my best analysis is, and we know the hijackers were trained at U.S.
[00:41:23.482 --> 00:41:24.243]  bases.
[00:41:24.243 --> 00:41:30.005]  We know they ordered the embassies in Saudi Arabia, this is on record, to let them into the country even though they were on terror list.
[00:41:30.005 --> 00:41:32.867]  They were told, don't worry, their terror designation is a cover.
[00:41:33.547 --> 00:41:33.867]  I think?
[00:41:48.755 --> 00:41:53.737]  Whatever went on with those aircraft, these guys thought they were taking part in airport security drills, which we know they do.
[00:41:53.737 --> 00:41:57.078]  Always trying to sneak bombs in and the rest of it, that comes out all the time.
[00:41:57.078 --> 00:42:04.260]  The Navy SEALs do it, the Air Marshals do it, the FBI does it, the Pentagon does it, and that's also a nice cover in their drill to run a real attack.
[00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:08.201]  And that, I mean, what's your best breakdown?
[00:42:08.201 --> 00:42:11.322]  I know you don't like to speculate about what really went on on 9-11.
[00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:20.955]  Well, I believe these guys were probably, thought that they were participating in some sort of official activity.
[00:42:20.955 --> 00:42:28.220]  Look, Mahamed Adda was on Jack Abramoff's casino boat a few days before 9-11 down at Madeira Beach, Florida.
[00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:34.364]  He'd also been seen quite frequently at the Officer's Club at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama.
[00:42:34.364 --> 00:42:38.967]  So here we have somebody who's not just the wild terrorist.
[00:42:39.147 --> 00:42:52.014]  He's using drugs, he's drinking, he's got hookers every night, he's got tons of cash, all these guys have got, you know, FBI paying for their houses, informants living with them, and oh yeah, this is a Muslim extremist.
[00:42:52.014 --> 00:42:53.894]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:42:53.894 --> 00:43:03.059]  My gut feeling is Abel Danger, and what we know about it, and how they tried to, you know, they basically went after Kurt Weldon when he brought this all up.
[00:43:03.059 --> 00:43:08.562]  I think Abel Danger was the control, at least monitoring the people who were controlling these guys.
[00:43:14.026 --> 00:43:35.764]  And that's what, to interrupt and add more proof, that's what, of course, Sybil Edmonds has now broken her gag order last year and said, look, I was monitoring them for the FBI as an interpreter, and quote, Al Qaeda was under CIA command on the day of 9-11, and then what has Colonel Schaefer said here, as much as he can, he said, basically, look,
[00:43:36.264 --> 00:43:47.459]  There were private contractors protecting Al-Qaeda and the army wasn't allowed to move in, the light side of the army, and that that's what was going on.
[00:43:48.294 --> 00:44:04.495]  Well, I believe, and I think this is yet another clear indication that this was, that 9-11 was an Operation Northwood that was actually carried out successfully, because no one was ever brought to trial for this act of treason.
[00:44:04.495 --> 00:44:06.478]  We just had a former ambassador, Joe Wilson,
[00:44:06.898 --> 00:44:12.366]  Say the other day that he accused Dick Cheney of committing treason by outing his wife Valerie Plame.
[00:44:12.366 --> 00:44:17.974]  Well, if Dick Cheney commits treason doing that, how do we know he didn't commit treason for being involved in 9-11?
[00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:35.608]  Well, this is a big deal that the Al Qaeda 9-11 mastermind, the mastermind of the underwear bombing, the Fort Hood shooting, the Times Square dud, this Anwar al-Awlaki, is meeting at the Pentagon with the top brass and the Secretary of the Army two months after 9-11.
[00:44:35.608 --> 00:44:36.209]  I mean, this is huge, Wayne!
[00:44:38.908 --> 00:44:41.189]  Well, let's not forget Sgt.
[00:44:41.189 --> 00:44:46.992]  Ali Mohammed from Fort Bragg, who was bin Laden's, basically, one of his chief aides.
[00:44:46.992 --> 00:44:49.453]  I mean, here he's trained by the U.S.
[00:44:49.453 --> 00:44:56.216]  Special Forces, and his name is all over this whole Al-Qaeda operation.
[00:44:56.216 --> 00:44:59.418]  I think, like, Al-Qaeda, when you look at them, have more people in it.
[00:44:59.418 --> 00:45:06.742]  Let's not also forget Adam Gaddan, who was born Adam Perlman, who's, I believe, his grandfather was the head of the 80s.
[00:45:07.842 --> 00:45:16.501]  In Los Angeles, if Bin Laden is dead, Osama, that would make him al-Amriki, number two guy in charge of the so-called al-Qaeda.
[00:45:16.738 --> 00:45:38.788]  But it's supposedly patriotic to ignore all this, wrap yourself in the flag, give up all your liberties in the name of fighting terror, and then we learn Israeli, British, you name it, are part of NLE09, NLE010, quote, training to take on American terrorists, and we learn the entire apparatus of Homeland Security is not aimed at their Muslim cutouts, it's aimed at
[00:45:39.628 --> 00:45:48.820]  Liberals, conservatives, anti-war activists, gun owners, returning veterans, and the threat fusion centers are pointed at the locals.
[00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:52.144]  This is a criminal takeover and they staged 9-11 to get it done.
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:54.280]  That's what I believe.
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:46:13.308]  I believe it was a coup d'etat, a creeping coup d'etat, because we know that they had the Patriot Act already written, it was ready to go, and they just needed a vehicle to push it through Congress, and of course that was the anthrax attacks just a few weeks after 9-11.
[00:46:14.188 --> 00:46:29.257]  And we know, according to the Rand Corporation, when they passed the Derivatives Act, got rid of Glass-Steagall in 99, they began this accelerated move to a police state, and they knew this bubble and all their crimes were going to be coming out.
[00:46:29.257 --> 00:46:34.220]  They needed this control grid in place to be able to suppress the American people.
[00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:36.221]  Here we are nine years later, and they're saying,
[00:46:36.801 --> 00:46:54.197]  Homeland Security is for you, the Army's gonna take you on, you don't like having your pension funds taken, the Army and threat fusion centers have federalized your local police, guess what, the CIA's operating in every town and city, doesn't matter if it's illegal, and I mean you can really see the premeditated blueprint of this.
[00:46:54.197 --> 00:46:59.763]  Right, and I always remember what long-time White House correspondent Sarah McClendon, who was from Texas,
[00:47:00.774 --> 00:47:04.438]  One said when she got Bush's side, old man Bush, George H.W.
[00:47:04.438 --> 00:47:15.552]  Bush, and asked him a question, and he turned to her and said, Sarah, if the American people knew what we have done, they would chase us down the street and hang us.
[00:47:15.552 --> 00:47:19.817]  And I think for once, Bush was probably telling the truth.
[00:47:20.512 --> 00:47:23.554]  And people always say, something as big as 9-11, you couldn't hide it.
[00:47:23.554 --> 00:47:24.935]  They haven't hidden it.
[00:47:24.935 --> 00:47:29.938]  It's like taking a coffee can and shooting it with a 12-gauge shotgun with number 7 birdshot.
[00:47:29.938 --> 00:47:31.598]  There's hundreds of holes in it.
[00:47:31.598 --> 00:47:36.962]  I mean, it's just a sieve of total proof we know exactly what they did, and there it is!
[00:47:38.426 --> 00:47:42.647]  That's right, and I was just talking to a guy who worked in the Pentagon on 9-11.
[00:47:42.647 --> 00:47:57.970]  He was a senior Air Force Department official, and he said when he came out, he looked in that hole, that original hole, and he saw a small jet fan engine, the kind that you find on a drone.
[00:47:57.970 --> 00:48:02.671]  He saw nothing that indicated that a passenger plane is at the Pentagon.
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:04.101]  Amazing.
[00:48:04.101 --> 00:48:07.904]  In closing, what do you see happening with the cyber security takeover?
[00:48:07.904 --> 00:48:08.884]  I mean, how obvious is it?
[00:48:08.884 --> 00:48:25.518]  I'm going to have to hold you into the final segment of this hour because I want to get into WikiLeaks too, but to have the Israelis tacitly admit they launched the super worm, clearly with Microsoft working with them, according to the computer experts I've read in the press, but this is your main expertise is computers, formerly with the NSA.
[00:48:26.498 --> 00:48:28.700]  It's industrial, it has to be loaded directly in.
[00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:37.829]  So Israel and our media basically admit they did it, but now they're on the news saying we need to use this Duxnet worm to pass cybersecurity takeover.
[00:48:37.829 --> 00:48:38.890]  So there's another false flag.
[00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:43.815]  They admittedly launched it, and then we have to lose our internet freedom because the government launched an attack.
[00:48:44.525 --> 00:49:01.908]  Right, and look, even though Rahm Emanuel left the White House, we still have good old Cass Funstein and his cognitive infiltration team up there, and I think, you know, as long as he's in that job, we have to be very fearful of what the agenda is.
[00:49:01.908 --> 00:49:13.230]  And obviously, yes, we had this launch of this internet worm that was said to have disrupted Iran, but it spread quickly to other countries in Asia, and then it bounced back here into this country.
[00:49:14.490 --> 00:49:32.838]  And, you know, unfortunately, when you look at the people on the Homeland Security Committee, people like Joe Lieberman from Connecticut, his agenda, of course, is to increase the surveillance state and expand it beyond its present confines.
[00:49:32.838 --> 00:49:42.362]  But how brazen is that, where the government basically admits they launched the worm, and then, don't worry, they'll take over the web and surveil you to save you from the worm they admittedly launched?
[00:49:42.987 --> 00:50:00.333]  Well, I think one of the other agendas they have is they want to, in controlling the Internet, they also want to be able to have the access to all the encrypted communications that go across the Internet, from financial transactions to people even doing e-commerce, doing shopping on the Internet.
[00:50:00.493 --> 00:50:02.214]  Oh, they were on local news.
[00:50:02.214 --> 00:50:04.695]  Do five more minutes with us on the other side, Wayne, because I want to get into WikiLeaks.
[00:50:04.695 --> 00:50:10.637]  But they were on the news this morning knowing the Threat Fusion Center, run by the CIA, is about to be launched in Austin.
[00:50:10.637 --> 00:50:12.458]  It will have all your medical records.
[00:50:12.458 --> 00:50:13.658]  Everything you do will be tracked.
[00:50:13.658 --> 00:50:14.639]  You know, no warrants.
[00:50:14.639 --> 00:50:15.419]  It's great.
[00:50:15.419 --> 00:50:19.641]  And I heard talk show host locally praising it, saying, I have nothing to hide.
[00:50:19.641 --> 00:50:20.441]  Surveil me.
[00:50:20.441 --> 00:50:22.682]  Hey, folks, this is a terrorist government.
[00:50:22.682 --> 00:50:24.603]  It's federalizing your local police.
[00:50:24.603 --> 00:50:26.343]  It's a Gestapo.
[00:50:26.343 --> 00:50:27.984]  And, Wayne, your comments.
[00:50:28.969 --> 00:50:29.950]  I agree.
[00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:36.877]  You pick up the paper any day and you see a policeman has tasered an old lady somewhere.
[00:50:36.877 --> 00:50:39.159]  This is what we've turned into.
[00:50:48.959 --> 00:50:49.760]  We're good.

[00:52:02.814 --> 00:52:05.136]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:05.136 --> 00:52:08.340]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:13.445]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:13.445 --> 00:52:17.650]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:20.413]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:20.413 --> 00:52:23.177]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:23.177 --> 00:52:26.101]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:26.101 --> 00:52:33.711]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:34.031 --> 00:52:39.434]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:39.434 --> 00:52:41.736]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:41.736 --> 00:52:45.958]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:45.958 --> 00:52:47.039]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:47.039 --> 00:52:48.380]  You're everyone else.

[00:54:06.414 --> 00:54:10.659]  This country has fallen to absolute financial corruption.
[00:54:10.659 --> 00:54:14.204]  The police state is to secure the criminal gains.
[00:54:14.204 --> 00:54:17.648]  You are the target, I am the target, Wayne Madsen is the target.
[00:54:17.648 --> 00:54:20.232]  The Muslim extremists are the sword of the New World Order.
[00:54:21.943 --> 00:54:26.727]  And they're no doubt getting ready for domestic groups to stage events to really go after the American people.
[00:54:26.727 --> 00:54:33.152]  Don't forget we have the online video bookstore with key tools to further educate yourself, but mainly wake up your friends and family.

[00:55:19.161 --> 00:55:20.741]  Great way to spread the word.

[00:55:21.841 --> 00:55:23.702]  Check it out today and you make all this possible.
[00:55:23.702 --> 00:55:25.762]  Wayne, we got about four minutes left.
[00:55:25.762 --> 00:55:31.984]  WikiLeaks, you know, they're supposedly now saying they're going to list them as a group aiding terror so they can't get financial donations.
[00:55:31.984 --> 00:55:35.844]  Something Cass Sunstein's called for against the general public.
[00:55:35.844 --> 00:55:38.845]  They've tried to claim he's raping people and then they've dropped it.
[00:55:38.845 --> 00:55:40.085]  You know, sexual assault.
[00:55:40.085 --> 00:55:42.906]  I mean, do you still think you smell a big rat with WikiLeaks?
[00:55:43.467 --> 00:55:48.510]  Well, with any limited hangout buy-off operation, you've got to sweeten the pie.
[00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:51.732]  You've got to give the group some sort of street cred.
[00:55:51.732 --> 00:55:58.357]  So when they release the information you really want them to release, people will swallow that hook, line, and sinker.
[00:55:58.357 --> 00:56:07.002]  So the first big revelation, of course, was the video footage in Iraq of the guy shooting up these alleged journalists on the street.
[00:56:07.002 --> 00:56:09.103]  Okay, that gave them a street cred.
[00:56:09.103 --> 00:56:10.765]  But then we saw with the last big dump,
[00:56:13.326 --> 00:56:14.907]  Of information.
[00:56:14.907 --> 00:56:40.596]  They insinuated that the Taliban was being supported by Pakistan and also by Iran, which fits very nicely into David Petraeus's spread this conflict outside of Afghanistan to Pakistan to destabilize that country with the view of breaking up, to seize their nuclear weapons eventually, and also to turn up the heat on Iran.
[00:56:41.457 --> 00:56:47.561]  Very advantageous for these war planners to have those particular revelations.
[00:56:47.561 --> 00:56:55.587]  And Wikileaks may not even know this, but clearly 90-something thousand pages of cooked intelligence that we know is false, that's what gets leaked.
[00:56:55.587 --> 00:56:57.048]  That's right, that's right.
[00:56:57.048 --> 00:57:07.816]  And we know that even within Wikileaks they've had a big, you know, some people have left accusing Julian Assange of acting like a dictator.
[00:57:07.816 --> 00:57:10.878]  And I would note that Sweden recently denied him residency.
[00:57:11.558 --> 00:57:13.119]  Where do you see the whole WikiLeaks saga going?
[00:57:13.119 --> 00:57:16.840]  Do you have any intel on what these new revelations the Pentagon says they're bracing for?
[00:57:39.076 --> 00:57:42.018]  Oh yeah, when the Pentagon says they're bracing for it, what are they doing?
[00:57:42.018 --> 00:57:44.440]  They're adding to the anticipation, aren't they?
[00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:47.042]  I mean, they're building up to this crescendo.
[00:57:47.042 --> 00:57:56.388]  Everybody, all the media is waiting patiently, you know, with drool dripping from their tongues, waiting for these revelations.
[00:57:56.388 --> 00:57:58.009]  I think that's all part of the show.
[00:57:58.009 --> 00:58:00.491]  Why does the Pentagon even pay attention to it?
[00:58:01.232 --> 00:58:09.563]  It would make sense if they had actual important documents that could hurt, you know, warfighters abroad is what they say.
[00:58:09.563 --> 00:58:11.045]  They would kind of ignore it.
[00:58:14.108 --> 00:58:15.409]  I think he's on to something.
[00:58:15.409 --> 00:58:21.773]  I think Schaefer, that whole thing, he wasn't the only person who tried to talk about Abel Danger, Doorhawk Galley.
[00:58:21.773 --> 00:58:28.878]  But I think if we could have read his book and the notes and everything else, we would have had even more revelations.
[00:58:28.878 --> 00:58:29.799]  But that got blocked.
[00:58:29.799 --> 00:58:31.820]  Wayne Madsen, WayneMadsenReport.com.
[00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:33.361]  Thanks for popping in with us.
[00:58:33.361 --> 00:58:34.822]  Okay, anytime.
[00:58:34.822 --> 00:58:37.364]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with Lindsey Williams.
[00:58:37.364 --> 00:58:38.685]  You don't want to miss these developments.
[00:58:45.322 --> 00:58:47.472]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[00:58:50.250 --> 00:58:54.793]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:54.793 --> 00:58:55.714]  Number 1.
[00:58:55.714 --> 00:58:59.136]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:59.136 --> 00:58:59.997]  Number 2.
[00:58:59.997 --> 00:59:04.900]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:05.640]  It's true.
[00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:10.504]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:10.504 --> 00:59:11.344]  Number 3.
[00:59:11.344 --> 00:59:14.926]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:14.926 --> 00:59:18.609]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:18.829 --> 00:59:19.610]  Number 4.
[00:59:19.610 --> 00:59:22.372]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.372 --> 00:59:26.055]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:26.055 --> 00:59:26.856]  Number 5.
[00:59:26.856 --> 00:59:31.000]  A solar-powered generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:35.764]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:36.044 --> 00:59:40.206]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:40.206 --> 00:59:42.007]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:42.007 --> 00:59:44.248]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:59:44.248 --> 00:59:46.850]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:48.370]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:48.370 --> 00:59:54.093]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:09.802]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.802 --> 01:00:11.402]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.402 --> 01:00:12.943]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.943 --> 01:00:17.124]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.124 --> 01:00:21.206]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:36.102]  Well, he's had stunning accuracy.
[01:00:36.102 --> 01:00:41.184]  And because he's getting it from the same Bilderberg group circles that we've gotten key leaks from.
[01:00:41.184 --> 01:00:47.807]  I know who the individual is, of course.
[01:00:47.807 --> 01:00:50.968]  Dr. Stan Monteith, separately, he's been doing this for almost 50 years.
[01:00:50.968 --> 01:00:56.551]  He knows who this retired Big Three oil CEO is.
[01:00:56.551 --> 01:01:00.973]  And so I can confirm that this individual is real and is telling Lindsey Williams this information.
[01:01:02.422 --> 01:01:11.430]  Uh, and the bigger issue here is, uh, you know, are the circles he's still moving in, you know, is he being fed any disinfo?
[01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:16.815]  But now, all these revelations later, almost everything this guy's talked about has happened.
[01:01:16.815 --> 01:01:21.720]  You know, oil's at $50 a barrel, he says it's going to $150, it goes to $150.
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:23.441]  Just as Lindsey said it would.
[01:01:23.441 --> 01:01:25.163]  Well, now he's dying of cancer.
[01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:28.163]  Not Lindsey Williams, but his source is.
[01:01:28.163 --> 01:01:29.366]  Terminal cancer.
[01:01:29.366 --> 01:01:31.289]  He almost died already a year and a half ago.
[01:01:31.289 --> 01:01:33.373]  That's why this latest info came out.
[01:01:33.373 --> 01:01:35.096]  He's dying of cancer.
[01:01:35.096 --> 01:01:37.160]  Lindsey's talked to him several times the last two weeks.
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:52.870]  And it's just incredible revelations from a top-level elitist view of where everything's going and with us for the next hour and 30 minutes or so, then I'm getting into the Threat Fusion Centers and all the other economic news, is Pastor Lindsey Williams.
[01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:54.591]  Pastor, great to have you.
[01:01:54.591 --> 01:02:05.818]  If you can, just talk about this individual, kind of recap it, then we're going to come back in the long segment and just boil down all the big developments that he told you, then we'll go through each one in more detail.
[01:02:05.818 --> 01:02:08.060]  But Lindsey Williams, thank you for breaking this here first.
[01:02:09.021 --> 01:02:12.623]  Thank you, Alex, for allowing me the privilege of being on InfoWars this morning.
[01:02:12.623 --> 01:02:18.708]  And people out there in the listening audience, please, I beg of you, listen to this entire program.
[01:02:18.708 --> 01:02:20.349]  You need to hear everything.
[01:02:20.349 --> 01:02:29.677]  Do you realize that only seconds ago, only moments ago, Janet Napolitano came on over national news, the Homeland Security Director.
[01:02:30.217 --> 01:02:34.662]  And she said, we are very... Now this is a special bulletin only moments ago.
[01:02:34.662 --> 01:02:37.785]  I happened to catch it just before coming on the program right now.
[01:02:37.785 --> 01:02:43.351]  And she said, we are very concerned about a cyber war attack.
[01:02:43.351 --> 01:02:45.073]  I knew about this a week ago.
[01:02:45.073 --> 01:02:50.499]  Folks, you cannot imagine how important this... You were telling us this last night!
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:56.028]  I mean, we wrote notes on what you told us in that lengthy pre-interview to find out what's happening.
[01:02:56.028 --> 01:03:00.475]  You were saying, and now notice, the Israelis admittedly launched this worm.
[01:03:00.475 --> 01:03:05.303]  Now we've got to give up control of our internet because of a worm our own system launched.
[01:03:07.549 --> 01:03:09.670]  Yes, we are on the verge.
[01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:15.033]  I knew a week ago that we were on the verge of something catastrophic that the elite were going to do.
[01:03:15.033 --> 01:03:19.595]  And here this morning, just moments ago, Janet Napolitano says a cyber war.
[01:03:19.595 --> 01:03:24.237]  Folks, when I lived with the elite of the world for three years, I was their chaplain.
[01:03:24.237 --> 01:03:25.437]  I lived with them.
[01:03:25.437 --> 01:03:28.799]  And one of the first things I learned was, listen to their buzzwords.
[01:03:29.199 --> 01:03:32.940]  They tell you everything they're going to do before they do it.
[01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:37.542]  It is part of their, what should we say, their code of ethics.
[01:03:37.542 --> 01:03:49.205]  I believe that we have a definite wanting, and in the course of the program today, Alex, I'm going to tell your listening audience everything that they can expect through 2012.
[01:03:49.205 --> 01:03:50.005]  Amazing.
[01:03:50.005 --> 01:03:55.767]  Let's briefly talk about this, your source, and the fact that he already spilt his guts a few years ago because he thought he was going to die.
[01:03:55.767 --> 01:03:57.748]  Now he says he's terminally ill with cancer.
[01:03:58.735 --> 01:04:07.017]  Well, for the past 35 years, there have been two individuals that I knew when I lived with the elite of the world that have given me information.
[01:04:07.017 --> 01:04:17.020]  Every time they have said something, I dared to risk my credibility and go on every radio talk show I could get on, such as I'm doing right now with you, and tell what these people say.
[01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:18.400]  This individual
[01:04:19.290 --> 01:04:23.232]  I found out about three or four months ago that he had cancer.
[01:04:23.232 --> 01:04:29.555]  He went to the Law 48 out of Alaska where he lives to have cancer therapy.
[01:04:29.555 --> 01:04:31.716]  I could not contact him for about two months.
[01:04:31.716 --> 01:04:41.680]  I have been completely out of the talk show circuit for three months time because without information from him, I couldn't guarantee that what I was saying was true.
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:44.761]  I was finally able to contact him through his relatives.
[01:04:44.761 --> 01:04:46.122]  He is terminal with cancer.
[01:04:46.562 --> 01:04:50.927]  This man has told me everything that the elite are going to do.
[01:04:50.927 --> 01:04:54.291]  You can imagine that a person could lose power in a situation such as this.
[01:04:54.291 --> 01:04:55.393]  Yes, this is probably the most...
[01:05:00.469 --> 01:05:02.111]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:02.111 --> 01:05:05.474]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.
[01:05:05.474 --> 01:05:10.699]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.
[01:05:10.699 --> 01:05:14.142]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.

[01:05:20.649 --> 01:05:21.790]  Take my word for it.
[01:05:21.790 --> 01:05:24.433]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[01:05:24.433 --> 01:05:30.959]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.

[01:05:36.164 --> 01:05:37.426]  Well, Marty, what do you have to say?

[01:05:52.826 --> 01:05:53.647]  Thank you!
[01:06:01.391 --> 01:06:05.415]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:06:05.415 --> 01:06:08.658]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:06:08.658 --> 01:06:13.462]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:06:13.462 --> 01:06:19.848]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:06:19.848 --> 01:06:22.071]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:06:22.611 --> 01:06:22.911]  Tim Geithner?
[01:06:22.911 --> 01:06:23.412]  Bernanke?
[01:06:23.412 --> 01:06:23.772]  They're arsonists!
[01:06:23.772 --> 01:06:24.752]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:06:24.752 --> 01:06:26.874]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:06:41.522 --> 01:06:45.883]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[01:06:45.883 --> 01:06:48.784]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:06:48.784 --> 01:06:57.907]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:07:00.279 --> 01:07:03.862]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:07:03.862 --> 01:07:05.164]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:07:05.164 --> 01:07:09.548]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:07:09.548 --> 01:07:15.493]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:07:15.493 --> 01:07:17.655]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:07:17.655 --> 01:07:20.338]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:07:20.678 --> 01:07:27.181]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[01:07:27.181 --> 01:07:29.382]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:07:29.382 --> 01:07:34.724]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:07:34.724 --> 01:07:40.006]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:07:40.006 --> 01:07:45.369]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[01:07:45.369 --> 01:07:48.310]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[01:07:48.570 --> 01:07:53.813]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[01:07:53.813 --> 01:07:56.434]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:07:56.434 --> 01:08:05.839]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:05.839 --> 01:08:09.761]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:09.761 --> 01:08:13.383]  So the world is waking up to the globalist banking takeover.
[01:08:13.383 --> 01:08:17.385]  The majority of mortgages in foreclosure has been halted.
[01:08:19.116 --> 01:08:27.478]  It's coming out in mainstream news that one of the masterminds of 9-11 was meeting secretly at the Pentagon with the brass two months after the attacks.
[01:08:27.478 --> 01:08:33.339]  Anwar al-Awlaki, headlines at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:33.339 --> 01:08:33.899]  The U.S.
[01:08:33.899 --> 01:08:38.080]  government, allied with Israel, clearly put out the superworm a month ago.
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:39.920]  Now they say it's blowing back.
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:48.562]  The Pentagon needs to take the web over with cybersecurity and surveil everything you're doing and censor people and have a kill switch, which they already put in, they're just announcing it, to save you from it.
[01:08:49.022 --> 01:08:53.185]  And here it is, Pentagon will help Homeland Security Department fight domestic cyber attacks.
[01:08:53.185 --> 01:08:57.848]  And on local news, they're announcing the Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL, are spying on citizens.
[01:08:57.848 --> 01:09:01.250]  They're working with a threat fusion center run by the CIA.
[01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:04.632]  It's just totally illegal, total takeover of society.
[01:09:04.632 --> 01:09:05.453]  This is it.
[01:09:05.453 --> 01:09:07.714]  The soft coup is accelerating.
[01:09:07.714 --> 01:09:12.978]  And Lindsey Williams has spent months trying to get a hold of his former Big Three oil company CEO.
[01:09:14.839 --> 01:09:18.381]  We've always gotten great intel from, because they love to tell people what they're going to do.
[01:09:18.381 --> 01:09:24.987]  It mirrors the Bilderberg Group, Davos Switzerland info we get months after Williams talks about it.
[01:09:24.987 --> 01:09:26.548]  And he is dying of cancer.
[01:09:26.548 --> 01:09:27.769]  He's been under cancer treatment.
[01:09:27.769 --> 01:09:28.990]  He is terminal.
[01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:32.953]  And this may be one of the last times Lindsey's been able to talk with him.
[01:09:32.953 --> 01:09:39.699]  And we got cut off by the break, but I was saying, Lindsey, it sounds like what you're saying, you were actually out of breath yesterday when we talked to you, that
[01:09:40.379 --> 01:09:47.543]  That this is the biggest, most important information he's ever given you, and that he basically completely spilt his guts.
[01:09:47.543 --> 01:09:48.164]  Is that accurate?
[01:09:49.045 --> 01:10:11.378]  Yes, I would say that would be a good way to put it, and if ever anyone has doubted the existence of a group of people on the face of the earth who control the world, let me emphatically say to you as strongly as I possibly can, there is a group of people on the face of the earth who control the world, and they have definite plans right now for you and for your household.
[01:10:11.938 --> 01:10:28.307]  And folks, what you're going to hear today is just an extension of what Alex Jones is saying day after day, except I was able to get it from one of them himself, who now is at a point where he would probably tell everything in the condition he's in, Alex.
[01:10:28.307 --> 01:10:30.828]  Now, you've been able to talk to him several times the last two weeks.
[01:10:30.828 --> 01:10:32.489]  Do we know how long he thinks he has?
[01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:36.001]  Well, it's not going to be very long.
[01:10:36.001 --> 01:10:39.884]  He has terminal cancer, and I am very concerned for him.
[01:10:39.884 --> 01:10:42.785]  I'm also very concerned for him spiritually.
[01:10:42.785 --> 01:10:50.930]  In fact, in our last conversation, I've tried every way I possibly could to present him the truth of salvation through Jesus Christ.
[01:10:50.930 --> 01:10:59.475]  And Alex, I really think, and you probably hear my voice break because I'm so concerned, I really think we're going to see this man in heaven.
[01:11:01.175 --> 01:11:04.418]  Well, let's hope that's the case, and we'll talk about that before you leave.
[01:11:04.418 --> 01:11:05.679]  It's come up in about an hour and a half.
[01:11:05.679 --> 01:11:13.125]  Lindsay, run through, these are the notes I wrote from talking to you yesterday.
[01:11:13.125 --> 01:11:14.286]  Russia, China.
[01:11:14.286 --> 01:11:17.568]  Recent agreement with Russia to supply China with oil and natural gas.
[01:11:17.568 --> 01:11:18.329]  What that means.
[01:11:18.329 --> 01:11:19.230]  Iran.
[01:11:19.230 --> 01:11:21.631]  Elites want trouble within three to four months.
[01:11:21.631 --> 01:11:22.232]  Mortgages.
[01:11:22.232 --> 01:11:24.534]  Feds will own every mortgage in America.
[01:11:24.534 --> 01:11:25.495]  That's why they engineered this.
[01:11:26.397 --> 01:11:36.443]  Crude oil back to 150 to 200 a barrel in direct proportion to deflation of the dollar will result in five dollars a gallon in six to eight months.
[01:11:36.443 --> 01:11:39.745]  Gold silver won't slow down, will skyrocket from this point.
[01:11:39.745 --> 01:11:45.668]  And then you've got dealing with what he talks about this global leader that your source says they're going to have rise.
[01:11:45.668 --> 01:11:50.371]  And then your other source, who we won't name, who had dinner with Janet Napolitano.
[01:11:50.371 --> 01:11:52.091]  We'll get to that as well and some other issues.
[01:11:53.112 --> 01:11:59.262]  Let's run through these bullet points and other ones that we didn't write down and then let's start with what you think is most important and go through it in detail.
[01:12:00.265 --> 01:12:05.128]  Everything that Alex has just said, it will take place.
[01:12:05.128 --> 01:12:06.789]  The elite are on track.
[01:12:06.789 --> 01:12:08.209]  They're on time.
[01:12:08.209 --> 01:12:09.770]  They have a timeline.
[01:12:09.770 --> 01:12:16.794]  They are going to do these things exactly as they're saying, and nothing but divine intervention could possibly stop it.
[01:12:16.794 --> 01:12:18.255]  I have found out the following.
[01:12:18.255 --> 01:12:25.018]  Folks, keep your eyes on China and Russia, never mind the Middle East, never mind North and South Korea.
[01:12:25.018 --> 01:12:27.580]  Don't worry about these little skirmishes around the world.
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:32.943]  The very thing they want to get your mind off of is that which is most important.
[01:12:32.943 --> 01:12:36.526]  Right now, watch China and Russia.
[01:12:36.526 --> 01:12:39.448]  Russia and China just signed an agreement.
[01:12:39.448 --> 01:12:53.238]  China just announced they're going to freeze rare earth mineral shipments to the United States and they run the biggest mining operations in Africa and other areas like Australia to get those rare earth minerals used and everything that's electronic.
[01:12:54.164 --> 01:13:08.739]  Yes, and as of this year, Russia has become the number one supplier of crude oil on the face of the earth because of their super deep wells, which BP attempted to duplicate in the Gulf of Mexico, and as you know, they couldn't do it, and finally it blew out.
[01:13:08.739 --> 01:13:13.884]  Now, Russia is the number one supplier, surpassing Saudi Arabia as of this year.
[01:13:14.404 --> 01:13:23.538]  China and Russia have just signed an agreement whereby Moscow said that they are ready to supply all of the energy needs that China has.
[01:13:23.538 --> 01:13:26.963]  That is both crude oil and natural gas.
[01:13:26.963 --> 01:13:29.267]  And let me tell you why this is so important.
[01:13:29.267 --> 01:13:29.627]  Because...
[01:13:30.268 --> 01:13:36.551]  Well, we know Putin already uses the fact that, what is it, 80% or more of the gas to Europe comes from Russia.
[01:13:36.551 --> 01:13:38.772]  He's already used that before and has actually turned it off before.
[01:13:56.454 --> 01:14:03.119]  Yes, and can you imagine Wal-Mart without a single product made, that it says on it, made in China?
[01:14:03.119 --> 01:14:11.386]  I mean, folks, we are on the verge of something so catastrophic, and they say to me, watch China and Russia, folks, I am telling you in advance.
[01:14:11.386 --> 01:14:14.028]  Okay, what did he specifically say is going to happen on that front?
[01:14:14.875 --> 01:14:28.932]  Well, first of all, when Russia and China signed this agreement for the supply of all petroleum products, natural gas and so on, Alex, this is so important, there was no dollar value given to the deal.
[01:14:28.932 --> 01:14:29.573]  No!
[01:14:29.573 --> 01:14:30.434]  No dollar value.
[01:14:30.434 --> 01:14:30.814]  Why?
[01:14:30.814 --> 01:14:31.876]  They're not going to use the dollar.
[01:14:33.182 --> 01:14:41.509]  I mean, this is going to devastate our currency because now the whole world will follow suit and say, we're going to use something else.
[01:14:41.509 --> 01:14:42.930]  Well, we'll get back to that.
[01:14:42.930 --> 01:14:44.231]  And that move's already happening.
[01:14:46.161 --> 01:14:47.843]  Yes, it is happening right now.
[01:14:47.843 --> 01:14:55.630]  While you're listening to this program, this is taking place, and you are facing something with Russia and China that is so important.
[01:14:55.630 --> 01:15:00.214]  You want to focus all of your attention on what's happening with Russia and China.
[01:15:00.214 --> 01:15:12.045]  You remember, I said this on your program two years ago, whenever this gentleman gave me everything they were going to do through 2012, before he became terminally ill, and he said to me, he said,
[01:15:12.745 --> 01:15:14.205]  China is the big one.
[01:15:14.205 --> 01:15:16.006]  Do you remember those exact words?
[01:15:16.006 --> 01:15:19.246]  It's in my notes from two years ago on your program.
[01:15:19.246 --> 01:15:22.347]  And that's exactly what he's saying to me again.
[01:15:22.347 --> 01:15:24.147]  China is the big one.
[01:15:24.147 --> 01:15:25.747]  Watch Russia and China.
[01:15:25.747 --> 01:15:28.968]  That's where the big issues are going to take place in the near future, Alex.
[01:15:28.968 --> 01:15:33.509]  And that's why the globalists have all been moving there and moving their main operations.
[01:15:33.509 --> 01:15:35.489]  This isn't like our elite are failing.
[01:15:35.489 --> 01:15:36.609]  Our elite aren't our elite.
[01:15:36.609 --> 01:15:40.070]  They're the global corporate crime syndicate that's organized this whole thing.
[01:15:40.845 --> 01:15:42.866]  Yes, our elite know exactly what they're doing.
[01:15:42.866 --> 01:15:53.653]  For instance, Ford is investing $500 million with their new Chinese partner, Chongyang Ford Mazda Automobile Ltd.
[01:15:53.653 --> 01:15:58.355]  Right now, in China, $500 million engine plant in China, 400,000 engines annually.
[01:15:58.355 --> 01:16:00.036]  Ford is the 11th, listen to this,
[01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:08.201]  Washington has deceived us.
[01:16:08.201 --> 01:16:11.723]  Ford is the 11th ranking auto producer in China.
[01:16:11.723 --> 01:16:18.008]  Ford sold 368,000 vehicles in China since 2003.
[01:16:18.008 --> 01:16:24.552]  And we know GM, on record, used bailout money to move to China and Brazil.
[01:16:24.552 --> 01:16:27.674]  And we also, I saw it in the Statesman in Austin last week.
[01:16:28.434 --> 01:16:36.678]  The Communist Chinese government just leased 600,000 acres of prime oil and gas fields in Southeast Texas.
[01:16:36.678 --> 01:16:39.920]  So they are just taking everything over.
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:41.921]  They have become fabulously wealthy.
[01:16:41.921 --> 01:16:44.722]  The globalists gave the Panama Canal to them.
[01:16:44.722 --> 01:16:48.924]  They have positioned this takeover, this destruction of the U.S.
[01:16:48.924 --> 01:16:50.425]  from the highest levels of the government.
[01:16:51.147 --> 01:16:53.568]  And every bit of this is being done by the elitist.
[01:16:53.568 --> 01:16:58.090]  The very people that I rubbed shoulders with for three years on the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline.
[01:16:58.090 --> 01:16:58.950]  Alright, let's continue.
[01:16:58.950 --> 01:17:00.731]  Who would still give me information?
[01:17:00.731 --> 01:17:06.173]  Folks, believe everything you just heard Alex say and everything he's saying on his programs every day.
[01:17:06.173 --> 01:17:07.694]  This is not fantasy.
[01:17:07.694 --> 01:17:08.834]  This is for real.
[01:17:08.834 --> 01:17:10.335]  What did he say?
[01:17:10.335 --> 01:17:17.358]  So the dollar is going to start dying even faster with all this oil and gas coming online out of Russia.
[01:17:17.358 --> 01:17:18.258]  Other facets to that?
[01:17:19.093 --> 01:17:26.398]  Well, I do believe that they have accelerated, and please notice the words, I believe that they have accelerated that program.
[01:17:26.398 --> 01:17:30.902]  The main thing is, they do not want the American people to rise up.
[01:17:30.902 --> 01:17:33.924]  They are scared to death of rebellion.
[01:17:34.764 --> 01:17:38.166]  And folks, don't you depend on this election.
[01:17:38.166 --> 01:17:39.946]  It may turn out to be what you want it to be.
[01:17:39.946 --> 01:17:44.108]  On the other hand, they may rig these voting booths because they're electronic.
[01:17:44.108 --> 01:17:51.251]  You've got to understand that the elite are on track with what they're doing and they know exactly what's going to take place.
[01:17:51.251 --> 01:18:00.395]  And I do believe that they have accelerated their program because he's giving me some things now that I thought was going to take another year or two before they would take place.
[01:18:00.395 --> 01:18:02.836]  And we're going to talk about Iran today and a lot of these others.
[01:18:03.716 --> 01:18:08.221]  Alex, yeah, the elite are right on target.
[01:18:08.221 --> 01:18:13.286]  Alright, let's continue with the whole energy front.
[01:18:13.286 --> 01:18:15.348]  Let's get into what he told you on crude oil.
[01:18:16.394 --> 01:18:20.856]  Well, first of all, crude oil is a... Alright, let me go back just a ways.
[01:18:20.856 --> 01:18:24.298]  You remember two years ago, this individual called me on the phone.
[01:18:24.298 --> 01:18:26.879]  He was very angry at me because of something I'd said.
[01:18:26.879 --> 01:18:28.000]  He threatened me.
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:36.204]  And at the time, I tried to be friends with him and he said the price of crude oil is going from $147 a barrel to $50 a barrel.
[01:18:36.204 --> 01:18:37.844]  I came on Infowars.
[01:18:37.844 --> 01:18:38.805]  I told that.
[01:18:38.805 --> 01:18:41.286]  Two months later, it took place exactly like he said it.
[01:18:41.286 --> 01:18:43.147]  Now, folks, you can believe this also.
[01:18:43.787 --> 01:18:49.853]  There is going to be a definite move in crude oil prices immediately.
[01:18:49.853 --> 01:18:52.495]  You had best get your dinner table ready for it.
[01:18:52.495 --> 01:18:57.180]  All of you truck drivers out there, I beg of you to take note of this.
[01:18:57.180 --> 01:18:59.021]  Two years ago I said it was going down.
[01:18:59.907 --> 01:19:01.108]  It's over.
[01:19:01.108 --> 01:19:02.508]  Here's the sign.
[01:19:02.508 --> 01:19:03.308]  Watch crude oil.
[01:19:03.308 --> 01:19:03.869]  Okay.
[01:19:03.869 --> 01:19:14.553]  He gave to me a year ago, this individual, this elitist, he said to me, I want to give you a sign, Jafflin Williams, and I think he was giving it to me so that I could prepare my own personal household.
[01:19:14.553 --> 01:19:17.634]  I'm going to read it to you exactly like he said it a year ago.
[01:19:17.634 --> 01:19:25.017]  He said, watch crude oil prices and you will know the progression of the elitist in their program.
[01:19:25.017 --> 01:19:26.238]  These are his exact words.
[01:19:26.718 --> 01:19:28.559]  Now, where is crude oil going?
[01:19:28.559 --> 01:19:30.801]  You've made it just within the past few days.
[01:19:30.801 --> 01:19:34.764]  The useful fuel in my area has gone up 10 cents a gallon.
[01:19:34.764 --> 01:19:36.585]  Crude oil is going back.
[01:19:36.585 --> 01:19:37.606]  Are you ready?
[01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:38.366]  Here we are.
[01:19:38.366 --> 01:19:39.147]  Stay there.
[01:19:39.147 --> 01:19:39.487]  Stay there.
[01:19:39.487 --> 01:19:41.148]  We've got to go to break.
[01:19:41.148 --> 01:19:42.209]  Lindsey, we've got to go to break.
[01:19:42.209 --> 01:19:42.869]  Come back.
[01:19:42.869 --> 01:19:45.571]  We'll get into all this in detail on the other side.
[01:19:45.571 --> 01:19:47.052]  We'll get into Iran.
[01:19:47.052 --> 01:19:48.133]  We'll get into the elitist
[01:19:49.514 --> 01:19:52.038]  Basically getting themselves ready for total collapse.
[01:19:52.038 --> 01:19:53.580]  We'll talk about it all with Lindsey Williams.
[01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:54.421]  Key information.
[01:19:54.421 --> 01:19:55.623]  Call everybody you know.
[01:19:55.623 --> 01:19:57.205]  Tell them to tune in right now.
[01:19:57.205 --> 01:19:58.908]  This is important information.
[01:19:58.908 --> 01:19:59.528]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:00.874 --> 01:20:04.955]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:20:04.955 --> 01:20:09.457]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:20:09.457 --> 01:20:15.618]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:20:15.618 --> 01:20:18.039]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:20:18.039 --> 01:20:24.021]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:20:24.141 --> 01:20:27.546]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:20:27.546 --> 01:20:29.428]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:20:29.428 --> 01:20:31.611]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[01:20:31.611 --> 01:20:36.497]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[01:20:36.497 --> 01:20:37.298]  Guaranteed.
[01:20:37.298 --> 01:20:41.344]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[01:20:41.584 --> 01:20:46.389]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.
[01:20:46.389 --> 01:20:47.550]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[01:20:47.550 --> 01:20:48.271]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[01:21:00.382 --> 01:21:02.764]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:21:02.764 --> 01:21:04.945]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:21:04.945 --> 01:21:08.287]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:21:08.287 --> 01:21:13.391]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:21:13.391 --> 01:21:17.914]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:21:17.914 --> 01:21:20.255]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:21:20.255 --> 01:21:22.797]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:21:22.797 --> 01:21:25.659]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:21:26.039 --> 01:21:33.654]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:21:33.979 --> 01:21:39.364]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:21:39.364 --> 01:21:42.227]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:21:42.227 --> 01:21:45.911]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:21:45.911 --> 01:21:46.992]  And I got news for you.
[01:21:46.992 --> 01:21:48.333]  You're everyone else.
[01:21:48.333 --> 01:21:49.814]  Invisible Empire.

[01:21:59.844 --> 01:22:03.910]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:09.798]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:22:09.798 --> 01:22:10.920]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:14.905]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:22:15.606 --> 01:22:29.397]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:22:29.397 --> 01:22:35.022]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:22:35.022 --> 01:22:40.846]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[01:22:59.249 --> 01:23:04.454]  How well and how fast does heart and body extract work to improve blood circulation?
[01:23:04.454 --> 01:23:05.155]  Listen.
[01:23:05.155 --> 01:23:09.439]  My name is Ellis and I'm 66 years old and I live in Jacksonville, Florida.
[01:23:09.439 --> 01:23:12.822]  Two years ago, I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries.
[01:23:12.822 --> 01:23:15.885]  I had 70% blockage in one artery leading to my heart.
[01:23:15.885 --> 01:23:19.248]  They wanted me to go on Plavix, but I refused knowing the negative side effects.
[01:23:19.639 --> 01:23:28.064]  Heart and body extract is a unique balance, synergy, and proportion of herbs reaching from head to toe at maximum absorption around 95% at the cellular level.
[01:23:28.064 --> 01:23:30.625]  Within the first month, I felt a dramatic difference.
[01:23:30.625 --> 01:23:34.988]  The heaviness in my legs was reduced, and within two months, I felt completely normal.
[01:23:35.216 --> 01:23:39.418]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is Heart and Body Extract.
[01:23:39.418 --> 01:23:43.641]  Heart and Body Extract comes with a 100% ironclad money back guarantee.

[01:23:48.044 --> 01:23:49.945]  Call 866-295-5305, 866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[01:24:08.902 --> 01:24:11.911]  We're good to go.
[01:24:13.928 --> 01:24:15.528]  Okay, he got cut off by the break.
[01:24:15.528 --> 01:24:20.249]  Lindsey Williams, his top globalist source, is terminal with cancer.
[01:24:20.249 --> 01:24:22.210]  Spilt his guts to him.
[01:24:22.210 --> 01:24:31.472]  And remember back, you know, two and a half years ago, oil was $50, sometimes even lower, $45 a barrel crude oil.
[01:24:31.472 --> 01:24:33.032]  He said it's going to over $140.
[01:24:33.032 --> 01:24:35.373]  In the next couple months, it did.
[01:24:35.373 --> 01:24:35.733]  It went to $149, $150.
[01:24:35.733 --> 01:24:37.073]  And then he announced, okay, now it's gonna go down.
[01:24:42.094 --> 01:24:43.916]  And it went down.
[01:24:43.916 --> 01:24:46.057]  And you know, so many other predictions that have come true.
[01:24:46.057 --> 01:24:52.703]  But again, this guy, this top globalist, they might be feeding him real info the whole time to later give us disinfo.
[01:24:52.703 --> 01:25:00.589]  I'm not saying it is, it's just that, you know, it's not like God's appearing before us and telling us this, but it is very important because of the track record.
[01:25:00.589 --> 01:25:03.832]  And I also trust Lindsey Williams.
[01:25:03.832 --> 01:25:08.055]  But Lindsey, continuing, so what's the time frame on crude oil?
[01:25:08.055 --> 01:25:08.736]  Break it down for us.
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:16.561]  The track record of my elitist friends who have been giving me this information over the past 35 years has been impeccable.
[01:25:16.561 --> 01:25:21.722]  Everything he has ever said has happened exactly like he said it.
[01:25:21.722 --> 01:25:23.283]  Now, you can take this.
[01:25:23.283 --> 01:25:26.743]  I'm trying my best to warn you what they're going to do.
[01:25:26.743 --> 01:25:28.063]  I don't want to frighten you.
[01:25:28.063 --> 01:25:31.724]  I want to let you know the facts so that you can do something about it.
[01:25:31.724 --> 01:25:36.125]  A little under two years ago, this individual said to me, I'm still sitting here stunned,
[01:25:36.585 --> 01:25:40.046]  That he has been able to fulfill this exactly like they said.
[01:25:40.046 --> 01:25:47.288]  He said to me, Chaplain, within two years, you will be so poor, you will not be able to do anything about it.
[01:25:47.288 --> 01:25:50.789]  Now I'm quoting him verbatim, just under two years ago.
[01:25:50.789 --> 01:26:01.212]  Here we are two years later, and he is, and they're indicating that they're going to take crude oil now and turn it around in the opposite direction to where it went.
[01:26:01.212 --> 01:26:02.172]  Folks, get ready.
[01:26:02.612 --> 01:26:11.857]  You will be paying at the gas pump, and I'm going to give you the amount that it's going up to, and I'll give you an approximate as to what the time frame for all of this is.
[01:26:11.857 --> 01:26:13.698]  Again, let me repeat his sign.
[01:26:13.698 --> 01:26:18.861]  He gave me a sign one year ago, and this is so important.
[01:26:18.861 --> 01:26:19.421]  Write it down.
[01:26:20.141 --> 01:26:25.166]  Watch Crude Oil Prices and you will know the progression of the elite.
[01:26:25.166 --> 01:26:32.512]  Now that they have started back up with their crude oil prices, this means that their program is on schedule.
[01:26:32.512 --> 01:26:36.736]  They're doing exactly what they've been telling me over these years they were going to do.
[01:26:36.736 --> 01:26:37.157]  Here it is.
[01:26:37.904 --> 01:26:38.945]  Here's the price.
[01:26:38.945 --> 01:26:46.709]  Crude oil is going back to $152,200 a barrel.
[01:26:46.709 --> 01:26:52.152]  Gasoline at the gas pump will be $4 to $5 a gallon.
[01:26:52.152 --> 01:26:56.715]  This is going to contrive massive inflation.
[01:26:56.715 --> 01:26:59.557]  Can you imagine what this is going to do to airline fares?
[01:27:00.177 --> 01:27:06.680]  And now the Al Gores and others are positioned to roll out with their solution the quote green economy that they control.
[01:27:28.433 --> 01:27:33.315]  Yes, and every bit of this is part of their total program of what they're going to do.
[01:27:33.315 --> 01:27:43.499]  Now, what Janet Apolitano said only moments ago on national news, on a special bulletin, that they are very concerned about a cyber attack.
[01:27:43.499 --> 01:27:52.082]  Do you realize what this would do to crude oil prices when you went to, for instance, you go to the service station and you can't use your credit card?
[01:27:52.082 --> 01:27:55.203]  You go to the grocery store and you've got to have cash.
[01:27:55.203 --> 01:27:56.244]  And if you don't have cash,
[01:27:56.604 --> 01:28:00.810]  The cash registers aren't working because the internet is already broken down.
[01:28:00.810 --> 01:28:02.151]  Did he say anything about that?
[01:28:02.151 --> 01:28:05.296]  Well, certainly.
[01:28:05.296 --> 01:28:08.981]  We know the government launched the worm attack.
[01:28:08.981 --> 01:28:11.184]  Did he say anything specifically about cyber attacks to you?
[01:28:11.892 --> 01:28:12.913]  Did not mention that.
[01:28:12.913 --> 01:28:15.674]  It just so happened that Janet Napolitano came on over.
[01:28:15.674 --> 01:28:16.895]  No, no, they're hyping.
[01:28:16.895 --> 01:28:19.236]  Almost before I came on your program.
[01:28:19.236 --> 01:28:34.626]  And yet I had been told back about a week ago by this individual who had lunch with Janet Napolitano in Washington only last Thursday, I believe it was, that something major was about to take place and to get ready because it was going to happen.
[01:28:34.626 --> 01:28:39.709]  So when I saw that take place this morning, when I heard her announcement, I said, here are buzzwords.
[01:28:40.129 --> 01:28:42.511]  But she told you more!
[01:28:42.511 --> 01:28:51.497]  This person that had lunch with the head of Homeland Security, she reportedly told her, get six months of food and water ready?
[01:28:51.497 --> 01:29:04.967]  Yeah, I need to give some background to this in a few months, but that's exactly what Janet Napolitano told her personally at a lunch, a private lunch that she and Janet Napolitano had, and she said, I want you to go straight home,
[01:29:05.916 --> 01:29:09.119]  Get six months worth of food and water, store it in your house.
[01:29:09.119 --> 01:29:10.380]  Something is about to happen.
[01:29:10.380 --> 01:29:13.583]  I can't tell you what it is.
[01:29:13.583 --> 01:29:22.230]  Well, it could just be another stock market collapse with all this mortgage news, or it could be a cyber attack these people are trying to pass in the next lame-duck session, their cybersecurity takeover.
[01:29:22.230 --> 01:29:22.911]  It's already in place.
[01:29:22.911 --> 01:29:25.833]  They just want to formalize it with everybody.
[01:29:25.833 --> 01:29:26.514]  Stay there, Lindsey.
[01:29:26.514 --> 01:29:28.776]  Long segment coming up.
[01:29:28.776 --> 01:29:31.017]  I want to go through more of
[01:29:32.119 --> 01:29:38.644]  When this individual believes it's going to 150, a barrel of 200, that means $5 plus a gallon of gas.
[01:29:38.644 --> 01:29:41.666]  You're sitting within six to eight months from this source.
[01:29:41.666 --> 01:29:47.950]  Then we're going to talk about so many of the other issues, and not just things on my list, but other things he told you.
[01:29:47.950 --> 01:29:50.852]  We're going to run through those when we come back.
[01:29:50.852 --> 01:29:52.233]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.233 --> 01:29:54.775]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.775 --> 01:29:57.436]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.441 --> 01:30:04.623]  Subject to public police action.
[01:30:04.623 --> 01:30:05.884]  Tyranny is here.
[01:30:05.884 --> 01:30:09.766]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:30:09.766 --> 01:30:12.068]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:12.068 --> 01:30:17.932]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:30:17.932 --> 01:30:24.177]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:24.577 --> 01:30:30.578]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:30:30.578 --> 01:30:34.739]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:30:34.739 --> 01:30:39.020]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:44.982]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:44.982 --> 01:30:48.522]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:30:48.522 --> 01:30:50.503]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:30:50.503 --> 01:30:50.943]  It's here.

[01:31:00.273 --> 01:31:04.454]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:31:04.454 --> 01:31:10.875]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:31:10.875 --> 01:31:18.256]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:31:18.256 --> 01:31:23.117]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:31:28.038 --> 01:31:31.561]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:32:00.898 --> 01:32:15.321]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:32:16.368 --> 01:32:21.050]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:21.050 --> 01:32:33.815]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:32:33.815 --> 01:32:41.078]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:32:41.778 --> 01:32:52.144]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.

[01:33:01.889 --> 01:33:07.892]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[01:33:07.892 --> 01:33:10.454]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:17.449 --> 01:33:19.230]  We're going back to Lindsey Williams in a moment.
[01:33:19.230 --> 01:33:20.771]  He'll be with us 30 minutes to the next hour.
[01:33:20.771 --> 01:33:25.895]  I've got a bunch of other economic and police state news we absolutely must cover.
[01:33:25.895 --> 01:33:27.777]  We will open the phones up.
[01:33:27.777 --> 01:33:31.419]  Coming up here in just a little while if you've got questions or comments for Lindsey Williams.

[01:33:43.248 --> 01:33:43.388]  Yeah.
[01:34:01.730 --> 01:34:04.252]  That's going to start shipping just here in the next day.
[01:34:19.286 --> 01:34:24.009]  Like cyber security, flu outbreaks, staged terror, to bring in this control grid.
[01:34:24.009 --> 01:34:28.471]  They actually go to facilities that have been designated to be used as emergency centers.
[01:34:28.471 --> 01:34:32.113]  They interview security personnel that have been trained for forced inoculations.
[01:34:32.113 --> 01:34:34.014]  Very important interviews in this film.
[01:34:34.014 --> 01:34:35.035]  Enemy of the State.

[01:34:47.521 --> 01:34:50.543]  Geoengineering, Chemtrails, Exposed, Geovergriffin produced it.
[01:34:50.543 --> 01:34:51.823]  Excellent documentary.
[01:34:51.823 --> 01:34:55.585]  The first film to come out about chemtrails since the government declassified a lot of this.
[01:34:55.585 --> 01:34:57.206]  Incredible information.
[01:34:57.206 --> 01:34:58.206]  What in the world are they spraying?

[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:30.560]  So I appreciate that.
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:31.160]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:35:33.001 --> 01:35:38.523]  And I wanted to reach the $500,000 level to really be able to finish the studio and continue going into this depression.
[01:35:38.523 --> 01:35:39.343]  We've raised about $420,000.
[01:35:39.343 --> 01:35:41.684]  I want to thank everybody that has given.
[01:35:41.684 --> 01:35:43.985]  Most of it, small donations, around $20.
[01:35:43.985 --> 01:35:46.426]  Thank you for helping us get the word out.
[01:35:46.426 --> 01:35:47.786]  We couldn't do it without you.

[01:35:56.729 --> 01:36:08.435]  Pastor Lindsey Williams is our guest, and of course he has the website reformation.org.
[01:36:08.435 --> 01:36:11.076]  We'll tell you about some of his books and films as well before he leaves us.
[01:36:11.076 --> 01:36:12.497]  We can find out more there.
[01:36:12.497 --> 01:36:18.440]  Okay, Lindsey, I want to go to calls, but I don't want to interrupt you, so run through the list I've got.
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:21.061]  Break down what Napolitano told one of your good friends.
[01:36:21.681 --> 01:36:22.282]  I don't know.
[01:36:41.965 --> 01:36:43.126]  I don't know.
[01:37:01.702 --> 01:37:08.187]  And so we're going to get into that, get into the other facets on gold, get into the other facets on the mortgage situation, Iran.
[01:37:08.187 --> 01:37:18.875]  Let's cover what Napolitano told your associate, let's cover Iran, let's cover the mortgages, gold and silver, devil's messiah, what he told you about a world religious leader, all of this.
[01:37:18.875 --> 01:37:23.098]  Let's go over and then anything else in your notes that you didn't give us yesterday in that talk we had.
[01:37:23.098 --> 01:37:23.639]  Lindsey Williams.
[01:37:24.582 --> 01:37:31.306]  There is a very prominent Hispanic political activist in Phoenix, Arizona.
[01:37:31.306 --> 01:37:34.488]  A very devout Christian, this person is.
[01:37:34.488 --> 01:37:45.194]  As you remember, Janet Napolitano, who is now the Director of Homeland Security, was the Governor of Arizona prior to going to Washington under the President's administration.
[01:37:46.174 --> 01:38:03.593]  Uh, when Janet Napolitano went to Washington, she asked this very prominent activist, whose name I have in front of me right here, I could call on the phone if I wanted to, and she asked her to come to Washington and be the liaison between the Hispanic community of America and
[01:38:04.253 --> 01:38:05.154]  I know you're a Christian.
[01:38:26.188 --> 01:38:29.230]  But she said, you cannot talk about abortion.
[01:38:29.230 --> 01:38:31.671]  You cannot talk about homosexuality.
[01:38:31.671 --> 01:38:39.114]  You cannot talk about, and you cannot disagree with the present administration in any manner.
[01:38:39.114 --> 01:38:41.535]  But she said, we'd like you to take the job.
[01:38:41.535 --> 01:38:48.398]  Well, this individual, very strong Christian, said, I'm sorry, Janet, I can't give up my Christian convictions for the sake of $170,000 a year.
[01:38:48.398 --> 01:38:49.279]  She said, I can't take the job.
[01:38:52.700 --> 01:38:54.382]  As a result, didn't.
[01:38:54.382 --> 01:39:06.736]  Last week, this individual was back in Washington again, trying to raise money, trying to get some grants for some of her Hispanic organizations, and Janet Napolitano heard that she was in Washington.
[01:39:06.736 --> 01:39:11.401]  Janet called her on the phone and said, would you please let's have lunch together?
[01:39:11.901 --> 01:39:12.361]  They did.
[01:39:12.361 --> 01:39:14.381]  I think it was Thursday of last week.
[01:39:14.381 --> 01:39:15.122]  This is recent.
[01:39:15.122 --> 01:39:18.002]  I'm not talking about two, three, four, five weeks ago.
[01:39:18.002 --> 01:39:19.662]  I'm talking about last week.
[01:39:19.662 --> 01:39:22.123]  This individual just got back to Phoenix.
[01:39:22.123 --> 01:39:30.044]  And she said, in the course of the conversation, Janet said, now I am only saying this to some very close friends of mine.
[01:39:30.044 --> 01:39:33.085]  And she said, I want you to go back to Phoenix.
[01:39:33.085 --> 01:39:40.166]  And the first thing I want you to do is store in your house six months supply of food and water immediately.
[01:39:40.896 --> 01:39:43.298]  And this individual said, Janet, why?
[01:39:43.298 --> 01:39:44.720]  She said, I can't tell you.
[01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:46.862]  She said, something is about to happen.
[01:39:46.862 --> 01:39:50.345]  She said, go back and take care of this right now.
[01:39:50.345 --> 01:39:52.126]  This was very urgent.
[01:39:52.126 --> 01:39:55.009]  And this was Thursday of last week, if I remember correctly.
[01:39:55.009 --> 01:40:04.578]  Folks, you've got to understand that what Alex is saying on his show, what you're hearing on InfoWars, this is not fantasy out there someplace.
[01:40:04.578 --> 01:40:05.539]  This is for real.
[01:40:06.059 --> 01:40:10.162]  These people are ready to do some very drastic things.
[01:40:10.162 --> 01:40:23.690]  And fortunately, because of the elitists whom I know and have known over these 35 years, one of whom now is terminal and just about to die, they're giving me this information and I am passing it on to you.
[01:40:23.690 --> 01:40:26.712]  I hope that you will take action and do something about it.
[01:40:26.712 --> 01:40:29.094]  Janet said to this lady, go home.
[01:40:29.094 --> 01:40:31.395]  Get six months supply of food and water.
[01:40:31.395 --> 01:40:32.256]  Let me stop you there!
[01:40:32.256 --> 01:40:33.437]  Let me stop you there!
[01:40:33.937 --> 01:40:38.198]  Let me stop you there, because this is important, and I'm not saying that she didn't say this, I believe it.
[01:40:38.198 --> 01:41:00.623]  This person contacted you, and it'll be pretty easy for folks to figure out who she is, but... I remember in January and February of last year, 1999, a year and a half ago, or more, we had emergency managers we talked to, newspaper people that talked to emergency managers, Indiana, Vermont, Texas, New York State,
[01:41:01.499 --> 01:41:02.726]  We even got documents.
[01:41:02.726 --> 01:41:03.993]  This is before the flu broke out.
[01:41:04.980 --> 01:41:12.126]  They were saying, oh, this is only for your sheriff, this is only for your police chief, this is only for your threat fusion center, this is only for your mayor.
[01:41:12.126 --> 01:41:19.954]  There will be a flu pandemic, it will kill millions, martial law is coming, and prepare for war with the American people, harden all your facilities.
[01:41:19.954 --> 01:41:23.277]  We wrote stories, we did the interviews, it all, okay.
[01:41:23.277 --> 01:41:31.104]  Then a few months later in April, in the wrong hemisphere, wrong time of year, a novel flu that top scientists said was engineered popped up, but it was a hoax.
[01:41:32.975 --> 01:41:44.323]  So again, they use fear to get everybody to do what they want, or they test the fear, and then it's about really giving you a shot that's had other deadly things added to it, that is a binary weapon.
[01:41:44.323 --> 01:41:59.953]  So I'm not, all I'm saying is I believe she told her this, I believe she called you and told you this, and I know this is what the elitist, you know, that I read about in the paper and also have chance to talk to, say that, you know, they've been told, for whatever reason, war, depression, you know, get ready.
[01:42:01.809 --> 01:42:03.611]  And we know the government's always building bunkers.
[01:42:03.611 --> 01:42:06.313]  Let me punctuate this with something that is happening.
[01:42:06.313 --> 01:42:09.215]  You follow this for yourself on the national news.
[01:42:09.215 --> 01:42:11.197]  Insider trading.
[01:42:11.197 --> 01:42:13.379]  Now, let me try to explain it if I may.
[01:42:13.379 --> 01:42:14.220]  On the stock market,
[01:42:15.127 --> 01:42:18.971]  There's the average, ordinary, everyday John Doe that trades at the stock market.
[01:42:18.971 --> 01:42:21.934]  Then there is what is called insider trading.
[01:42:21.934 --> 01:42:28.620]  That means people who are the CEOs, the corporate heads of corporations in America.
[01:42:28.620 --> 01:42:32.344]  Many of them are the elitists themselves, not all, but some.
[01:42:33.084 --> 01:42:42.449]  Insider trading means when these corporate heads, these CEOs, trade on the stock market, it's called insider trading.
[01:42:42.449 --> 01:42:46.351]  Whenever the average John Doe trades, it's just an average person trading.
[01:42:46.351 --> 01:42:47.411]  Here are the statistics.
[01:42:47.411 --> 01:42:48.892]  Please write these down.
[01:42:48.892 --> 01:42:52.294]  September the 13th through the 17th of this year,
[01:42:53.155 --> 01:42:58.818]  It was 400 to 1 of insider trading on the New York Stock Market.
[01:42:58.818 --> 01:43:07.342]  That means insiders, corporate heads, heads of CEOs, were selling their own corporate stocks.
[01:43:07.342 --> 01:43:13.845]  And it was 400 to 1, 400 being of the corporate sellers, compared to one of the John Doe out here selling.
[01:43:13.845 --> 01:43:15.005]  Listen to this figure.
[01:43:15.005 --> 01:43:17.567]  October the 4th through the 8th.
[01:43:17.567 --> 01:43:19.287]  Now, we're right here.
[01:43:19.287 --> 01:43:20.428]  We're almost today.
[01:43:21.738 --> 01:43:27.641]  The inside of trading has gone to 1,600 to 1.
[01:43:27.641 --> 01:43:29.242]  Folks, are you getting this?
[01:43:29.242 --> 01:43:40.248]  Do you understand that the corporate kids, the CEOs, the corporation managers, that these people are selling their own company stocks and bailing out in mass?
[01:43:40.248 --> 01:43:43.169]  And they have done it within one month's time from 400 to 1 to 1,600 and 1.
[01:43:43.169 --> 01:43:44.190]  What is it that these
[01:43:47.401 --> 01:43:50.402]  The elitist, many of them, and these corporate heads.
[01:43:50.402 --> 01:43:56.105]  What is it that they know that you and I don't know while they're bailing out?
[01:43:56.105 --> 01:43:58.526]  Continue.
[01:43:58.526 --> 01:44:08.210]  Well, I was told by my elitist friend, and I recorded it on DVD, that by 2012, the dollar will be dead.
[01:44:08.210 --> 01:44:09.871]  What is it that these people know?
[01:44:09.871 --> 01:44:12.152]  They know what's about to happen.
[01:44:12.152 --> 01:44:14.473]  They know that we're going to a world currency.
[01:44:14.993 --> 01:44:17.614]  They know that the dollar is on its way out.
[01:44:17.614 --> 01:44:18.615]  Russia knows it.
[01:44:18.615 --> 01:44:19.635]  China knows it.
[01:44:19.635 --> 01:44:25.518]  That's the reason they didn't sign their agreement for crude oil and natural gas using dollars.
[01:44:25.518 --> 01:44:28.279]  Instead, they said, we're going to use another currency.
[01:44:28.279 --> 01:44:31.461]  They're looking to the future because they know what's going to happen.
[01:44:31.461 --> 01:44:33.422]  The elitists have it already.
[01:44:34.122 --> 01:44:39.106]  They already have stated to me that by 2012, the dollar will be dead.
[01:44:39.106 --> 01:44:40.967]  Folks, you'd better prepare.
[01:44:40.967 --> 01:44:45.270]  Anything that you're going to do with your dollars, you need to do them now.
[01:44:45.270 --> 01:44:47.512]  Because you may not have the opportunity.
[01:44:47.512 --> 01:44:50.434]  The dollar is crashing very rapidly.
[01:44:50.434 --> 01:44:54.777]  This is very obvious that something is in the wind that the elitists are doing.
[01:44:54.777 --> 01:44:59.361]  Now, they don't want to wait until the American people get so angry and upset
[01:44:59.961 --> 01:45:01.722]  That they start a revolution.
[01:45:01.722 --> 01:45:07.425]  They want to bring it about in such a manner that you will be so poor you won't be able to do anything.
[01:45:07.425 --> 01:45:11.787]  Let me read you the three statements that he gave to me just under two years ago.
[01:45:11.787 --> 01:45:16.449]  He said, within two years, you will not recognize America.
[01:45:16.449 --> 01:45:17.450]  I'm reading them verbatim.
[01:45:18.070 --> 01:45:20.452]  Again, and I recorded this on DVD.
[01:45:20.452 --> 01:45:22.974]  I'm so glad I did so nobody can ever doubt it.
[01:45:22.974 --> 01:45:26.317]  He said again, by 2012 the dollar will be dead.
[01:45:26.317 --> 01:45:33.423]  Again, in the same conversation, he said within two years nearly everyone will be working for the government.
[01:45:33.843 --> 01:45:42.589]  This is before the takeover of General Motors, and Chrysler, and AIG, and the bank problems that we had toward the end of the Bush administration, and before healthcare.
[01:45:42.589 --> 01:45:50.634]  Do you realize that all of these things are coming to pass exactly as this individual told me they would happen?
[01:45:50.634 --> 01:45:51.855]  Amazing.
[01:45:51.855 --> 01:45:55.658]  Continuing, let's look at the Iran situation.
[01:45:55.658 --> 01:45:56.758]  What did he tell you on Iran?
[01:45:56.758 --> 01:45:57.379]  That's the big one.
[01:45:58.303 --> 01:46:03.345]  I am so glad you asked about this, Alex, because Iran right now is critical.
[01:46:03.345 --> 01:46:11.988]  You remember that two years ago, and again, I recorded this on my DVD series, and I said, everybody thought we won the war with Iran two years ago.
[01:46:11.988 --> 01:46:19.390]  We had all of our Air Force, our Navy, Marines, everybody battle ready right out there in the Persian Gulf.
[01:46:19.970 --> 01:46:24.775]  And he said no, it's not going to happen for a couple years, but that was a couple years ago.
[01:46:34.158 --> 01:46:39.421]  Yeah, and then one year ago, nearly everybody was getting ready for it again, and he said the same thing.
[01:46:39.421 --> 01:46:43.344]  He said, Chaplain, it is not time for war with Iran yet.
[01:46:43.344 --> 01:46:46.046]  Well, I'm changing my tune altogether.
[01:46:46.046 --> 01:46:47.827]  It's now.
[01:46:47.827 --> 01:46:48.847]  It's time.
[01:46:48.847 --> 01:46:52.370]  They are within three... Folks, please jot this down.
[01:46:52.370 --> 01:47:03.637]  You are within three to four months of... And I'm putting this just as positively as I can in a manner that they would say the elite won't.
[01:47:04.398 --> 01:47:07.742]  A Middle East crisis within four to five months time.
[01:47:07.742 --> 01:47:09.123]  It is now.
[01:47:09.123 --> 01:47:11.526]  Before, I said you have nothing to worry about.
[01:47:11.526 --> 01:47:15.951]  I'm telling you now, you're within four to five months to the time that they want this.
[01:47:15.951 --> 01:47:16.512]  It is time.
[01:47:19.090 --> 01:47:26.375]  Well I don't even know what to say to that because so much, almost everything that this individual has told you has been dead on.
[01:47:26.375 --> 01:47:34.281]  Very few things have not been dead on and he said no war with Iran now, now he's saying they are going to do it.
[01:47:35.239 --> 01:47:38.922]  He says they want a conflict in the Middle East.
[01:47:38.922 --> 01:47:45.426]  Now, this could be with Israel, this could be concerning the West Bank, this could be many different things.
[01:47:45.426 --> 01:47:49.049]  They want a conflict, but don't focus your attention on that.
[01:47:49.049 --> 01:47:52.271]  Folks, I go back to what I said at the beginning of the program today.
[01:47:52.271 --> 01:47:55.373]  Please, don't allow these little conflicts.
[01:47:55.373 --> 01:47:58.776]  Yeah, but an attack on Iran, every major analyst talks about.
[01:47:59.856 --> 01:48:00.997]  $200 a barrel, $400 a barrel.
[01:48:00.997 --> 01:48:03.338]  I mean, it runs the gamut of $200 and above.
[01:48:03.338 --> 01:48:07.339]  I mean, that would do your oil situation right there.
[01:48:07.339 --> 01:48:09.300]  But watch China and Russia.
[01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:19.243]  Don't get so involved in watching what takes place in the Middle East that you... No, no, I understand that they've made these oil deals and China's shifting away from dollars and so is Russia.
[01:48:19.243 --> 01:48:20.764]  That's all mainstream news.
[01:48:20.764 --> 01:48:23.565]  My issue is, what else did he say was going to happen with China and Russia?
[01:48:24.710 --> 01:48:29.572]  Well, naturally China is not going to be our best friend from this point on.
[01:48:29.572 --> 01:48:41.097]  They're cashing out, they don't want our T-Bills anymore, they're not coming to the Federal Reserve options, and many of you will remember that I warned you about this a year and a half ago when this individual was on the phone with me.
[01:48:41.577 --> 01:48:50.881]  And he said whenever other countries stop buying our T-bills and our Federal Reserve auctions, that the dollar is going to collapse because there's nobody to back it up.
[01:48:50.881 --> 01:48:57.303]  Now the Federal Reserve is buying their own T-bills back again and monetizing the debt in a different manner.
[01:48:57.303 --> 01:49:01.825]  We are in everything this man told me in the past two years has happened.
[01:49:01.825 --> 01:49:02.365]  It's like that.
[01:49:02.365 --> 01:49:06.767]  Now watch China, because China is not going to continue buying our currencies.
[01:49:06.767 --> 01:49:08.468]  Instead, they're going to gold and silver.
[01:49:08.468 --> 01:49:09.068]  Okay, you ready?
[01:49:09.628 --> 01:49:10.909]  There's the next one.
[01:49:10.909 --> 01:49:12.531]  Gold and silver.
[01:49:12.531 --> 01:49:18.677]  Oh my goodness people, I want you, I begged of you two years ago to buy gold and silver.
[01:49:18.677 --> 01:49:20.659]  Now folks, I don't sell gold and silver.
[01:49:20.659 --> 01:49:23.782]  I don't represent any gold and silver dealer or company.
[01:49:23.782 --> 01:49:29.808]  You couldn't buy a piece of gold or silver for me if you call me on my phone personally and ask me to sell it to you.
[01:49:29.808 --> 01:49:32.331]  I am telling you what I have been told.
[01:49:32.911 --> 01:49:39.553]  Gold and silver, when I won you two years ago, it was $600 to $650 an ounce.
[01:49:39.553 --> 01:49:44.494]  Today it's $1,350 an ounce, and it's still cheap.
[01:49:44.494 --> 01:49:46.515]  Where is gold and silver going?
[01:49:46.515 --> 01:49:47.975]  Here is the prediction.
[01:49:47.975 --> 01:49:51.196]  The currency of the elite is gold and silver.
[01:49:51.836 --> 01:49:56.358]  They are not going to allow anything to control it nor to disturb it.
[01:49:56.358 --> 01:50:04.100]  I warn you, years ago, gold and silver, and I've just been told, is going up, up, up, up, up.
[01:50:04.100 --> 01:50:05.981]  Can I say it in a plainer?
[01:50:05.981 --> 01:50:07.842]  You have seen nothing yet.
[01:50:07.842 --> 01:50:14.484]  The price of gold and silver is going so catastrophic about what it is today, you have never seen the like.
[01:50:15.064 --> 01:50:31.320]  It is the... I was told by this elitist that the only place that you could protect your assets is in gold and silver, and even at $1,350 an ounce, it still is cheap compared to what you're going to be paying for it a year from now.
[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:32.220]  And that's what he told you?
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:35.521]  Yes, it's going to continue to go up and up and up.
[01:50:35.521 --> 01:50:37.261]  There is no end to this.
[01:50:37.261 --> 01:50:38.482]  It is the only thing.
[01:50:38.482 --> 01:50:40.803]  You can't depend on real estate anymore.
[01:50:40.803 --> 01:50:42.343]  There's no way in this world.
[01:50:42.343 --> 01:50:45.084]  This mortgage crisis, and we haven't even gotten all that stuff yet.
[01:50:45.084 --> 01:50:49.526]  Yeah, let's cover the mortgage crisis when we come back, and any other key intel he gave you.
[01:50:51.886 --> 01:51:01.809]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:01.809 --> 01:51:07.410]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.410 --> 01:51:12.411]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.411 --> 01:51:17.452]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:17.992 --> 01:51:23.214]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[01:51:44.683 --> 01:51:48.125]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.

[01:54:09.505 --> 01:54:13.228]  With Pastor Lindsey Williams.
[01:54:13.228 --> 01:54:24.237]  For those that just joined us, his top globalist source that he's known for 30 plus years is dying of cancer and just basically spilled his guts to him in the last two weeks.
[01:54:24.237 --> 01:54:25.899]  We were getting into mortgages.
[01:54:25.899 --> 01:54:33.325]  Let's break down what he told you concerning all the mortgage fraud and the big mortgage scandals that are going on right now.
[01:54:33.325 --> 01:54:34.586]  Go ahead, Lindsey Williams.
[01:54:35.669 --> 01:54:39.757]  It's by the providence of God that I know what I know.
[01:54:39.757 --> 01:54:43.485]  Let me stress to every person out there in the listening audience, I was invited.
[01:54:44.454 --> 01:54:49.896]  to be the chaplain on the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline and got to know these people back 35 years ago.
[01:54:49.896 --> 01:54:50.817]  They're now old.
[01:54:50.817 --> 01:54:52.457]  Most of them are retired.
[01:54:52.457 --> 01:54:54.918]  And they have been willing to tell me these things.
[01:54:54.918 --> 01:55:03.862]  I pass on to you only what I feel by the providence of God I've been given so that you can be properly warned and know the issues.
[01:55:03.862 --> 01:55:06.563]  You won't get information like this from the national media.
[01:55:06.563 --> 01:55:08.484]  You won't hear it any other place.
[01:55:08.484 --> 01:55:11.005]  I don't know of any other person on the face of the earth
[01:55:11.485 --> 01:55:18.010]  That one of these elitists talked to, as he has been willing to talk to me, over the past two years time.
[01:55:18.010 --> 01:55:22.312]  One of the issues that has been so prominent lately is a mortgage crisis.
[01:55:22.312 --> 01:55:26.515]  And let me tell you what they, the elitists, have planned.
[01:55:26.515 --> 01:55:28.457]  They planned it way back in the 80s.
[01:55:28.457 --> 01:55:30.418]  They knew exactly what they were doing.
[01:55:30.418 --> 01:55:32.659]  This is not happening by chance.
[01:55:32.659 --> 01:55:34.481]  Every bit of this is by design.
[01:55:34.481 --> 01:55:36.622]  It is M.D.S.
[01:55:36.622 --> 01:55:38.323]  You'll be hearing this word more and more.
[01:55:38.323 --> 01:55:40.525]  Mortgage-backed securities.
[01:55:41.198 --> 01:55:48.740]  They started these teaser loans, these interest only, all the modern day method of mortgaging.
[01:55:48.740 --> 01:55:52.601]  Now that's both for residential and commercial real estate.
[01:55:52.601 --> 01:55:59.703]  They knew when they started issuing these loans that it was going to wind up exactly where it is today.
[01:56:00.715 --> 01:56:08.799]  And it is estimated that the mortgage-backed securities issue is as high as $45 trillion.
[01:56:08.799 --> 01:56:14.682]  A professor at a university up in the Northeast gave this statistic this past week.
[01:56:14.682 --> 01:56:16.622]  It's mind-boggling.
[01:56:16.622 --> 01:56:23.866]  What they've done is they have taken your house mortgage, they've taken the residential and the commercial mortgages, and they've sliced them and they've diced them.
[01:56:24.586 --> 01:56:33.792]  And without having paperwork, they only had oftentimes computer entries to prove that they had the rights to be able to do this.
[01:56:33.792 --> 01:56:43.299]  They have sold these things to everything from pension funds, to mutual funds, to banks, to insurance companies, to France, to England.
[01:56:43.299 --> 01:56:45.360]  They've sold them all over the world.
[01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:48.002]  And they've used them for bartering and trading.
[01:56:48.002 --> 01:56:52.345]  And it's oftentimes what you hear about
[01:56:52.885 --> 01:56:56.988]  Uh, as the secret instrument, so to speak, is going on today.
[01:56:56.988 --> 01:56:59.991]  Now, what is the end result of this going to be?
[01:56:59.991 --> 01:57:06.976]  Folks, this is so... When I heard this, I literally was mind-boggled.
[01:57:09.123 --> 01:57:14.769]  Eventually, the government will have to step in and bail this industry out.
[01:57:14.769 --> 01:57:17.872]  There is no way, and they won't.
[01:57:17.872 --> 01:57:22.657]  The end goal of this is for this crisis to become so critical.
[01:57:22.657 --> 01:57:26.700]  Now you remember, only about two weeks ago, Bank of America, Chase,
[01:57:27.942 --> 01:57:35.187]  A number of other lending institutions said, we're not going to any longer make any foreclosures.
[01:57:35.187 --> 01:57:38.970]  We're not going to sell any foreclosed mortgages on houses.
[01:57:38.970 --> 01:57:45.115]  And then just the beginning of this week, they came back and changed it all together and said, we're starting all over again.
[01:57:45.115 --> 01:57:47.577]  They are scared to death.
[01:57:47.577 --> 01:57:52.181]  The lending institutions have, they have repossessed property.
[01:57:52.181 --> 01:57:55.724]  They've turned around and resold that property illegally.
[01:57:55.724 --> 01:57:56.905]  Now, please listen to this.
[01:57:58.399 --> 01:58:04.062]  You have bought a house within the past three years time that was a repossession.
[01:58:04.850 --> 01:58:09.073]  You probably cannot get a clear title to it, and the banks know it.
[01:58:09.073 --> 01:58:12.056]  And you will lose, you ought to lose that property.
[01:58:12.056 --> 01:58:13.417]  I don't want to frighten you.
[01:58:13.417 --> 01:58:21.023]  But if you bought anything repossessed from one of the lending institutions in the past three years, you are due to lose it.
[01:58:21.023 --> 01:58:21.823]  Why?
[01:58:21.823 --> 01:58:23.865]  Because they don't have proper titles.
[01:58:23.865 --> 01:58:25.266]  They don't have the warranty deeds.
[01:58:25.266 --> 01:58:27.688]  They did not get the paperwork from the counties.
[01:58:27.688 --> 01:58:31.211]  And these $45 trillion worth of debt is out there.
[01:58:31.531 --> 01:58:32.392]  Lindsey, stay there.
[01:58:32.392 --> 01:58:35.593]  We're going to do five more minutes on this and then go directly to calls.
[01:58:35.593 --> 01:58:38.095]  We're going to finish up with this key information straight ahead.
[01:58:38.095 --> 01:58:38.775]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:38.775 --> 01:58:46.580]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.580 --> 01:58:48.801]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.558 --> 01:58:55.101]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:55.101 --> 01:58:56.021]  Number 1.
[01:58:56.021 --> 01:58:59.444]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:59.444 --> 01:59:00.304]  Number 2.
[01:59:00.304 --> 01:59:05.187]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:05.187 --> 01:59:05.928]  It's true.
[01:59:05.928 --> 01:59:10.811]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:10.811 --> 01:59:11.631]  Number 3.
[01:59:11.631 --> 01:59:15.214]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:15.214 --> 01:59:18.916]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:19.116 --> 01:59:19.917]  Number 4.
[01:59:19.917 --> 01:59:22.680]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:22.680 --> 01:59:26.364]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:26.364 --> 01:59:27.144]  Number 5.
[01:59:27.144 --> 01:59:31.309]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:31.309 --> 01:59:36.074]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:36.354 --> 01:59:40.516]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:59:47.160 --> 01:59:48.540]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:48.540 --> 01:59:54.423]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.305 --> 02:00:10.149]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.149 --> 02:00:11.710]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.710 --> 02:00:13.651]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.651 --> 02:00:17.474]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.474 --> 02:00:23.278]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.278 --> 02:00:28.542]  This is so important that we're just going to keep Lindsey for the rest of this third hour.
[02:00:28.542 --> 02:00:32.165]  We may even have to do a part two coming up tomorrow or next week.
[02:00:33.700 --> 02:00:39.731]  But everything Lindsey's covering from his top globalist source has either come true or partially true.
[02:00:39.731 --> 02:00:42.816]  And everything he's saying, I can analyze from the outside.
[02:00:42.816 --> 02:00:46.102]  We've been predicting for forever.
[02:00:46.102 --> 02:00:46.843]  And now it's here.
[02:00:48.112 --> 02:01:07.548]  But from the analyst I've talked to, from my own view, we know the top globalist, above even the banks, engineered this bubble to then hold the world hostage, to bankrupt all the pension funds, to steal all the retirees' money, and then hold you hostage and say, give us even more power, let us raise taxes to prop all this up or it's all going down.
[02:01:07.548 --> 02:01:11.991]  But you notice as you prop it up, it just continues to cascade into more crises.
[02:01:11.991 --> 02:01:13.373]  And in my notes here,
[02:01:14.702 --> 02:01:15.102]  I don't know.
[02:01:28.800 --> 02:01:34.502]  And they'll say, okay, we'll fix your mortgages, but they already passed a law two weeks ago that Obama hadn't signed yet.
[02:01:34.502 --> 02:01:39.204]  He pocket vetoed it, meaning he can bring it up after the election in a few weeks.
[02:01:39.204 --> 02:01:43.566]  And they're saying he's gonna do that to allow banks to take houses without proper title.
[02:01:43.566 --> 02:01:46.427]  So that's the pitch.
[02:01:46.427 --> 02:01:48.868]  Oh, we'll fix all this.
[02:01:48.868 --> 02:01:56.832]  We'll fix the banking system or it's all going down, but let us take property without any real deed, without chain of title.
[02:01:58.024 --> 02:02:00.746]  And then the precedent set for even more looting and stealing.
[02:02:00.746 --> 02:02:15.079]  Then we have the executive orders of Bush and Obama saying for any crisis, including economic, in PDD 51, the Presidential Decision Director says the same thing, the Congress can be suspended for six months, the President can do anything he wants, Europe has passed similar laws.
[02:02:15.079 --> 02:02:19.543]  We're about to go to break, Lindsey, and then take calls, but finishing up with the mortgage issue and what he told you.
[02:02:20.322 --> 02:02:22.443]  The elitists have engineered this.
[02:02:22.443 --> 02:02:23.984]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[02:02:23.984 --> 02:02:33.609]  They want a crisis to grow so big that they're basically just waiting until it can grow so large that they can say to the Federal Reserve, you've got to bail us out.
[02:02:33.609 --> 02:02:40.952]  Of course, they'll do it through the Treasurer of the United States of America like they've done the other bailout programs of GN and Chrysler and AIG.
[02:02:40.952 --> 02:02:42.453]  And they'll say, there's no way.
[02:02:42.453 --> 02:02:44.574]  The world is going to collapse.
[02:02:44.574 --> 02:02:46.135]  The sky is going to fall in.
[02:02:46.135 --> 02:02:48.076]  And so as a result, you can expect
[02:02:48.616 --> 02:03:03.986]  In the future, and this is what the elite want, they want the government to step in and bail out these mortgage-backed securities, and it's going to take an original bailout somewhere between the tune of $2 and $7 trillion.
[02:03:03.986 --> 02:03:06.628]  That's the original bailout.
[02:03:06.628 --> 02:03:11.131]  It could go as far as $45 trillion if they bail out everything that's out there.
[02:03:11.131 --> 02:03:12.472]  Now, what's this going to bring about?
[02:03:12.472 --> 02:03:13.653]  Oh, this is the scary part.
[02:03:14.373 --> 02:03:16.174]  Whenever this happens.
[02:03:16.174 --> 02:03:21.376]  Now this man told me two years ago, and I couldn't comprehend what he was saying.
[02:03:21.376 --> 02:03:24.797]  He said, after two years you will be so poor.
[02:03:24.797 --> 02:03:28.519]  And he said again, after two years nearly everyone will be working for the government.
[02:03:28.519 --> 02:03:33.781]  Folks, when they bail out this mortgage-backed security issue that we've got right now,
[02:03:34.793 --> 02:03:42.097]  And that's how they're taking houses that are even, they're even taking houses that are paid for because the note was sold to so many people, they're all coming to get it.
[02:04:00.585 --> 02:04:01.226]  That's right.
[02:04:01.226 --> 02:04:09.532]  If you have bought a house within the past three years that was repossessed, you probably do not own clear title to it, and they can come in and take it.
[02:04:09.532 --> 02:04:13.755]  You will be their slave.
[02:04:13.755 --> 02:04:15.116]  Alex, I don't know how to say to these people.
[02:04:15.116 --> 02:04:16.137]  No, no, that's how it works.
[02:04:16.137 --> 02:04:21.341]  The government, Israel and the U.S., releases the worm and says, we've got to take the web over.
[02:04:21.341 --> 02:04:26.505]  They create the mortgage crisis and then say, we've got to take over to save it, and then it only gets worse.
[02:04:26.505 --> 02:04:27.806]  I mean, this is what they do.
[02:04:29.502 --> 02:04:32.063]  Yes, and folks, I plead with you.
[02:04:32.063 --> 02:04:34.845]  You've got to know the intricate details of this.
[02:04:34.845 --> 02:04:38.347]  I know on the Alex Jones Show, I'm giving it just very briefly.
[02:04:38.347 --> 02:04:40.088]  You've got to know the intricate details.
[02:04:40.088 --> 02:04:41.048]  Well, stay there, stay there.
[02:04:41.048 --> 02:04:42.089]  We're going to come back, take calls.
[02:04:42.089 --> 02:04:43.450]  We've got you for the rest of the hour.
[02:04:43.450 --> 02:04:46.591]  There's a lot of other issues he told you and more details we haven't gotten to.
[02:04:46.591 --> 02:04:55.296]  After calls in about 30-40 minutes, we will get back into more of the information, more of the details and some key issues we haven't covered yet with Lindsey Williams.
[02:04:55.296 --> 02:04:56.177]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:56.177 --> 02:04:56.637]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.979 --> 02:05:04.563]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:05:04.563 --> 02:05:05.864]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:05:05.864 --> 02:05:10.249]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:05:10.249 --> 02:05:16.195]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:05:16.195 --> 02:05:18.357]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:05:18.357 --> 02:05:21.040]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:05:21.380 --> 02:05:27.863]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[02:05:27.863 --> 02:05:30.084]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:05:30.084 --> 02:05:35.426]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:05:35.426 --> 02:05:40.708]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[02:05:40.708 --> 02:05:46.071]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[02:05:46.071 --> 02:05:49.012]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[02:05:49.252 --> 02:05:55.055]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[02:05:55.055 --> 02:06:00.758]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:06:00.758 --> 02:06:07.421]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:06:07.421 --> 02:06:12.564]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:06:12.564 --> 02:06:14.425]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[02:06:16.621 --> 02:06:27.488]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit

[02:06:38.208 --> 02:06:39.429]  Others don't.

[02:06:41.570 --> 02:06:43.351]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[02:07:56.472 --> 02:08:01.776]  Check them out today.
[02:08:01.776 --> 02:08:04.018]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.018 --> 02:08:10.543]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:10.543 --> 02:08:13.025]  Why did I make Fall of the Republic?
[02:08:13.025 --> 02:08:13.665]  We did tail.
[02:08:14.744 --> 02:08:21.529]  The banker takeover, the mortgage scam, their plan, the carbon taxes, it's all covered in my film, Fall of the Republic.
[02:08:23.035 --> 02:08:26.976]  America's last stand, make the choice liberty or tyranny.
[02:08:26.976 --> 02:08:31.097]  Follow the Republic documents how an offshore corporate cartel is bankrupting the U.S.
[02:08:31.097 --> 02:08:32.518]  economy by design.
[02:08:32.518 --> 02:08:37.820]  Leaders are now declaring that world government has arrived and the dollar will be replaced with a new global currency.
[02:08:37.820 --> 02:08:39.660]  This has been out now eight months.
[02:08:39.660 --> 02:08:42.661]  President Obama has brazenly violated Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S.
[02:08:42.661 --> 02:08:47.142]  Constitution by seating himself at the head of the United Nations Security Council, thus becoming the first U.S.
[02:08:47.142 --> 02:08:48.683]  President to chair the world body.
[02:08:49.503 --> 02:08:55.404]  A scientific dictatorship is in the final stages of completion and laws protecting basic human rights are being abolished worldwide.
[02:08:55.404 --> 02:08:58.925]  An iron curtain of high-tech tyranny is now descending over the planet.
[02:08:58.925 --> 02:09:08.168]  A worldwide regime controlled by an unelected corporate elite is implementing a planetary carbon tax that will dominate all human activity and establish a system of neo-feudal slavery.
[02:09:08.168 --> 02:09:11.748]  The image makers have carefully packaged Obama as the world's savior.
[02:09:11.748 --> 02:09:18.070]  He is the Trojan horse manufactured to pacify the people just long enough for the globalists to complete their master plan.
[02:09:18.570 --> 02:09:23.919]  This film reveals the architecture of the New World Order and what the power elite have in store for humanity.
[02:09:23.919 --> 02:09:30.810]  More importantly, it communicates how we the people can retake control of our government, turn the criminal tide, and bring the tyrants to justice.
[02:09:31.636 --> 02:09:35.599]  And it's got Oath Keepers, Expanded Bonus Extras, and a lot more.
[02:09:35.599 --> 02:09:37.320]  This film needs to be seen by everybody.
[02:09:37.320 --> 02:09:45.265]  Sure, you know all about this as listeners, or as PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, but your friends and family who laughed at you five years ago, they're not gonna laugh now.
[02:09:45.265 --> 02:09:54.511]  As Ron Paul has said, it's so critical to expose the globalists, and that they've engineered this in their own words and own documents, so that people know who to blame, or the globalists will pose as our saviors.
[02:09:55.379 --> 02:09:58.322]  Get Fall of the Republic at InfoWars.com.
[02:09:58.322 --> 02:10:02.185]  Obama deception covers a lot of the same issues, but again, it was made a year and a half ago.
[02:10:02.185 --> 02:10:03.186]  It's all important.
[02:10:03.186 --> 02:10:06.269]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:10:06.269 --> 02:10:10.933]  You can view it and download it and burn it to give it to people, put it on access television, have public viewings, make copies.

[02:10:12.435 --> 02:10:16.178]  InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:10:16.178 --> 02:10:19.041]  Now, Lindsey, when we talked to you yesterday, I challenged you.
[02:10:19.041 --> 02:10:21.423]  I said, look, you've written best-selling books, you've
[02:10:21.903 --> 02:10:23.765]  May DVDs about what this guy told you.
[02:10:23.765 --> 02:10:26.307]  We don't have time for you to wait a month and do that.
[02:10:26.307 --> 02:10:38.796]  You need to make an audio CD going over all of this so it's concise and you said that you're stepping up to the plate in the next few days and getting that produced because an audio CD can be done in just a matter of days.
[02:10:38.796 --> 02:10:40.898]  I'm glad you're going with that idea.
[02:10:40.898 --> 02:10:49.145]  When the CD comes out or any of the previous DVDs you put out that predicted all this from your sources and your main source, how do folks get a hold of that?
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:54.765]  Please call our toll-free number right now, as quick as you can, after this program.
[02:10:54.765 --> 02:10:55.726]  Don't cut off.
[02:10:55.726 --> 02:10:57.027]  Don't change this dial.
[02:10:57.027 --> 02:10:58.489]  You stay right where you are.
[02:10:58.489 --> 02:11:01.592]  But after the program, please call our toll-free number.
[02:11:01.592 --> 02:11:01.612]  888-799.
[02:11:06.532 --> 02:11:07.473]  6-1-1-1.
[02:11:07.473 --> 02:11:11.494]  Now there's some people that would prefer not to call an operator.
[02:11:11.494 --> 02:11:13.855]  By the way, all of our operators are American operators.
[02:11:13.855 --> 02:11:15.836]  You won't hear any foreign operators.
[02:11:15.836 --> 02:11:19.378]  If you'd like to go on the web, please go to prophecyclub.com.
[02:11:19.378 --> 02:11:21.179]  P-R-O-P-H-E-C-Y-C-L-U-B.com.
[02:11:21.179 --> 02:11:23.139]  And six DVDs, eight hours
[02:11:29.002 --> 02:11:29.343]  We're good.
[02:11:43.094 --> 02:11:49.175]  6-1-1-1 or on the web at prophecyclub.com.
[02:11:49.175 --> 02:11:51.156]  We have the six DVDs.
[02:11:51.156 --> 02:11:55.357]  We have a CD that we will update almost weekly now.
[02:11:55.357 --> 02:11:58.857]  And with all of this new information we're giving, get all of it.
[02:11:58.857 --> 02:11:59.637]  I beg of you.
[02:11:59.637 --> 02:12:04.118]  And by the way, my DVDs and my CD are not copywritten.
[02:12:04.118 --> 02:12:05.839]  Did you understand what I said?
[02:12:05.839 --> 02:12:07.539]  They are not copywritten.
[02:12:08.019 --> 02:12:11.682]  That means you can copy them, give them out to your friends, get them out everywhere you can.
[02:12:11.682 --> 02:12:13.483]  I don't have time to be greedy.
[02:12:13.483 --> 02:12:20.207]  Will you please get my DVD set, six of them, and my CD set, which is being made today, at number 888-799-6.
[02:12:24.650 --> 02:12:25.270]  1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1
[02:12:52.822 --> 02:12:55.903]  But to be specific, this may be the last info we get from this guy.
[02:12:55.903 --> 02:12:57.283]  It's so important.
[02:12:57.283 --> 02:13:00.204]  And it's really proven to be very accurate.
[02:13:00.204 --> 02:13:01.944]  And then we'll recap it as well.
[02:13:01.944 --> 02:13:04.725]  But why do you think he's telling you all this?
[02:13:04.725 --> 02:13:08.266]  He called you up two years ago to threaten you and say, stop doing this to the oil company.
[02:13:08.266 --> 02:13:11.087]  But then he gave you all this other data and said, go ahead and tell folks that if you want.
[02:13:13.374 --> 02:13:23.586]  I gave three years of my life to be the chaplain to the elite of the world on the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline and there were two of these individuals that were very friendly with me when I was there.
[02:13:23.586 --> 02:13:26.349]  Some of them could have cared less and wouldn't have wiped their foot on me.
[02:13:26.349 --> 02:13:28.572]  There were two of them that did.
[02:13:28.572 --> 02:13:30.694]  I think it's totally out of respect.
[02:13:31.835 --> 02:13:38.360]  I probably am the only person of my kind that these two individuals have ever come in contact with in their life.
[02:13:38.360 --> 02:13:40.561]  You don't get to these people.
[02:13:40.561 --> 02:13:42.103]  You never get to know them.
[02:13:42.103 --> 02:13:44.284]  You never get to talk to them on the phone.
[02:13:44.284 --> 02:13:52.430]  And I think, Alex, out of respect for what I did in being their chaplain and keeping in touch with them these 35 years, they're giving me this information.
[02:13:52.430 --> 02:13:54.291]  But, you've also got to consider
[02:13:54.771 --> 02:13:56.232]  Death, dead, repentance.
[02:13:56.232 --> 02:13:59.494]  Now please, do you remember what happened to the thief on the cross?
[02:13:59.494 --> 02:14:02.516]  Christ was hanging there and two thieves were hanging there.
[02:14:02.516 --> 02:14:06.538]  And one of the thieves looked at him and said, remember me when you come into your kingdom.
[02:14:06.538 --> 02:14:08.579]  It was death, dead, repentance.
[02:14:08.579 --> 02:14:19.406]  And I think that this individual has for the past two years, knowing that he was sick, now knowing that he's terminally ill, I think that he has given me things that otherwise I would never know.
[02:14:20.186 --> 02:14:20.727]  Absolutely.
[02:14:20.727 --> 02:14:23.069]  Let's go to these calls now.
[02:14:23.069 --> 02:14:25.291]  Let's talk to Tim in Virginia.
[02:14:25.291 --> 02:14:26.752]  Tim, you're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[02:14:26.752 --> 02:14:27.112]  Go ahead.
[02:14:46.243 --> 02:14:50.226]  Well, you know, I heard a lot of different topics you talked about.
[02:14:50.226 --> 02:14:56.971]  You touched base about the trade agreement between China and Russia concerning oil.
[02:14:56.971 --> 02:15:03.815]  Well, in my opinion, that's one way of the Chinese hedging their bet against the Middle East during conflict.
[02:15:03.815 --> 02:15:08.098]  But the same standpoint, Russia is not part of the world economy.
[02:15:08.098 --> 02:15:13.162]  They'll export oil and platinum, but as far as Russia's selling
[02:15:13.795 --> 02:15:14.196]  All right.
[02:15:24.645 --> 02:15:25.406]  Hold on a minute, Tim.
[02:15:25.406 --> 02:15:27.728]  This is in the news that China and Russia have signed this deal.
[02:15:49.824 --> 02:15:52.825]  I want to finish, Tim.
[02:15:52.825 --> 02:15:57.586]  It's on record that China is exploring oil and gas even in Texas.
[02:15:57.586 --> 02:15:58.726]  I mean, they're in Africa.
[02:15:58.726 --> 02:16:00.107]  They're in the Middle East.
[02:16:00.107 --> 02:16:01.907]  They're everywhere.
[02:16:01.907 --> 02:16:03.608]  They're in Canada.
[02:16:03.608 --> 02:16:04.728]  They're everywhere.
[02:16:04.728 --> 02:16:06.808]  And they're looking for oil and minerals.
[02:16:06.808 --> 02:16:09.409]  They're now the biggest extractor of minerals in the world.
[02:16:09.409 --> 02:16:11.270]  They're building all the big facilities.
[02:16:11.270 --> 02:16:12.230]  They're putting in the mines.
[02:16:13.816 --> 02:16:18.917]  Last time I saw, more than half of the mining going on in Australia is the Chinese.
[02:16:18.917 --> 02:16:23.018]  And almost all the new startups are Chinese.
[02:16:23.018 --> 02:16:24.538]  So all of that is going on.
[02:16:24.538 --> 02:16:28.459]  And then we have the North American Union plan.
[02:16:28.459 --> 02:16:31.139]  We have Robert Pasture at the CFR's plan.
[02:16:31.139 --> 02:16:36.680]  We have the Baylor Agreement with Bush and Fox and Paul Martin at the time, five years ago.
[02:16:36.680 --> 02:16:40.561]  So everything Lindsey was saying on that front, I mean, that's all public.
[02:16:41.141 --> 02:16:48.602]  So China is trading raw materials and they've also got dollars, euros, yons.
[02:16:48.602 --> 02:16:51.263]  They're flush with cash to buy whatever they want.
[02:16:51.263 --> 02:16:55.203]  And these deals with China and Russia are on record.
[02:16:55.203 --> 02:16:56.864]  What are you saying, Tim?
[02:16:56.864 --> 02:17:01.845]  Well, I'm just saying that you don't hear about a proliferation of Chinese imports going to Russia.
[02:17:01.845 --> 02:17:06.005]  You don't hear about all these Chinese goods that we have here in the U.S.
[02:17:06.005 --> 02:17:09.346]  We don't hear about them in China or in Russia.
[02:17:09.346 --> 02:17:10.426]  You know, you don't hear about
[02:17:13.255 --> 02:17:24.926]  I mean, Russia is now the biggest oil and gas producer in the world.
[02:17:24.926 --> 02:17:27.489]  That's... I mean, just search the term.
[02:17:27.489 --> 02:17:29.751]  Russia now the biggest oil and gas producer in the world.
[02:17:29.751 --> 02:17:31.432]  It's ABC News.
[02:17:31.432 --> 02:17:32.073]  I mean, you name it.
[02:17:32.073 --> 02:17:34.976]  I mean, I'm really having trouble getting at what you're saying here, Tim.
[02:17:35.552 --> 02:17:40.233]  No dollar value was given to the deal that was made between China and Russia.
[02:17:40.233 --> 02:17:44.674]  And the reason no dollar value was given is because the dollar is not going to be used.
[02:17:44.674 --> 02:17:49.515]  They'll find their own method of bartering trade or currency, whatever they wish.
[02:17:49.515 --> 02:17:52.115]  But the main thing is... Well, no one can deny.
[02:17:52.115 --> 02:17:52.595]  Hold on.
[02:17:52.595 --> 02:17:53.235]  No one can deny.
[02:17:53.235 --> 02:17:55.056]  ...China and Russia and not other things.
[02:17:55.056 --> 02:17:57.216]  No one can deny there's a move away from the dollar.
[02:17:57.216 --> 02:17:59.097]  I mean, Tim, sum it up.
[02:17:59.097 --> 02:18:01.097]  I've got to cut you off here in a second, but sum up what you're saying.
[02:18:01.783 --> 02:18:04.664]  What I'm saying is that the Russia could manipulate the U.S.
[02:18:04.664 --> 02:18:06.585]  economy any way they can.
[02:18:06.585 --> 02:18:10.427]  They can sell gold below market price and make a profit.
[02:18:10.427 --> 02:18:14.109]  They can sell it at 600 bucks an ounce and they would still make a profit.
[02:18:14.109 --> 02:18:15.310]  Okay, Tim, I appreciate your call.
[02:18:15.310 --> 02:18:16.811]  Jack in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[02:18:16.811 --> 02:18:19.972]  Jack, go ahead.
[02:18:19.972 --> 02:18:20.933]  Jack dropped off.
[02:18:20.933 --> 02:18:22.654]  Kirk in Illinois, go ahead.
[02:18:22.654 --> 02:18:24.495]  Hey there.
[02:18:24.495 --> 02:18:24.835]  Hey.
[02:18:24.835 --> 02:18:28.517]  Hey, uh, Alex, I just wanted to real quickly say, uh,
[02:18:29.266 --> 02:18:31.688]  That the Money Bomb was the best program to date, man.
[02:18:31.688 --> 02:18:34.430]  Your guests are just top-notch, including Lindsey.
[02:18:34.430 --> 02:18:38.472]  Too bad he wasn't on that program, but I'm glad he's on today.
[02:18:38.472 --> 02:18:45.357]  The question I have for Lindsey is, how does the Fed Reserve Act expiring in 2012 figure in?
[02:18:45.357 --> 02:18:50.220]  And did your friend recently mention anything about the BP disaster in the Gulf?
[02:18:50.220 --> 02:18:50.741]  Anything new?
[02:18:51.638 --> 02:18:52.659]  Well, positively.
[02:18:52.659 --> 02:19:01.191]  In fact, whenever you call my 800 number, if you wish to get the CD on the BP disaster of the Gulf of Mexico, it's still there.
[02:19:01.191 --> 02:19:02.432]  You can ask them for it.
[02:19:02.432 --> 02:19:08.380]  I gave an in-depth, over an hour, hour and a half presentation... I know, but what I'm asking is what the caller's asking.
[02:19:09.361 --> 02:19:13.584]  What the caller's asking, Lindsey, was there anything new that he gave you on that?
[02:19:13.584 --> 02:19:15.545]  Oh, yes, positively.
[02:19:15.545 --> 02:19:20.808]  They have been able to fill that pipe with the drill mud.
[02:19:20.808 --> 02:19:26.232]  And they have stopped the leak, but that does not take care of the core exit problem.
[02:19:26.232 --> 02:19:28.653]  It does not take care of the oil that's already there.
[02:19:28.653 --> 02:19:31.155]  This is going to last for years and years and years to come.
[02:19:31.155 --> 02:19:32.436]  They have downplayed this.
[02:19:32.936 --> 02:19:40.640]  BP has hired every scientist that went down there to investigate it, and to put them on that payroll for years to come in order to keep them quiet.
[02:19:40.640 --> 02:19:44.842]  This is a disaster of disasters still, but nobody's even talking about it.
[02:19:44.842 --> 02:19:47.283]  Okay, sorry to interrupt you, we gotta go to break.
[02:19:47.283 --> 02:19:52.506]  I'm gonna let Kirk have another question if he wants to on the other side, then Howard, Blake, Sue, and others.
[02:19:52.506 --> 02:19:53.787]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll free number to join us.
[02:19:53.787 --> 02:19:56.088]  It is Thursday, the 21st day of October, 2010, InfoWars.com.
[02:20:03.052 --> 02:20:04.273]  This is not a drill.
[02:20:04.273 --> 02:20:06.774]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[02:20:06.774 --> 02:20:08.674]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[02:20:08.674 --> 02:20:15.898]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[02:20:15.898 --> 02:20:20.279]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[02:20:20.279 --> 02:20:30.604]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[02:20:31.264 --> 02:20:32.425]  Any circumstance.
[02:20:32.425 --> 02:20:39.628]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[02:20:39.628 --> 02:20:40.348]  But listen up.
[02:20:40.348 --> 02:20:46.591]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[02:20:46.591 --> 02:20:48.431]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[02:20:48.431 --> 02:20:50.592]  That's hideyourguns.com.
[02:20:50.592 --> 02:20:51.092]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[02:20:51.092 --> 02:20:52.933]  Before they come for your guns.
[02:20:52.933 --> 02:20:54.174]  Hideyourguns.com right now.
[02:21:00.472 --> 02:21:02.734]  Good day, Peter Krashenow from Midas Resources.
[02:21:02.734 --> 02:21:03.495]  Today is October 21st, 2010.
[02:21:03.495 --> 02:21:05.016]  We will open this morning at 1345.10.
[02:21:05.016 --> 02:21:07.999]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for 1380.16, 690.08 for a half ounce, and 345.04 for a quarter ounce.
[02:21:07.999 --> 02:21:08.499]  That's 1380.16, 690.08, and 345.04.
[02:21:20.169 --> 02:21:24.014]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm, warning of Greek-style U.S.
[02:21:24.014 --> 02:21:25.175]  debt crises.
[02:21:25.175 --> 02:21:27.337]  CBO is drawing a parallel between U.S.
[02:21:27.337 --> 02:21:29.760]  economy and the Greek economic meltdown.
[02:21:29.760 --> 02:21:34.786]  Debt to GDP climbing to unfamiliar territory and deficits rising to unsupportable levels.
[02:21:35.086 --> 02:21:36.087]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:21:36.087 --> 02:21:42.051]  The Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document the CBO has published is a must-read for every American.
[02:21:42.051 --> 02:21:48.216]  Covering the risks of deficit spending, aging population, and rising interest rates spells economic disaster.
[02:21:48.216 --> 02:21:48.896]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[02:21:48.896 --> 02:21:49.597]  I'll send it free.
[02:21:49.597 --> 02:21:50.338]  Again, call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:50.338 --> 02:21:51.398]  Ask for the CBO document.
[02:21:51.398 --> 02:21:51.598]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:00.526 --> 02:22:05.490]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:22:05.490 --> 02:22:06.490]  What have we got?
[02:22:06.490 --> 02:22:08.932]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:22:08.932 --> 02:22:09.933]  A republic.
[02:22:09.933 --> 02:22:12.595]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:22:12.595 --> 02:22:14.857]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:22:14.857 --> 02:22:16.878]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:22:16.878 --> 02:22:18.559]  So they think they own our land?
[02:22:18.559 --> 02:22:19.880]  They think they own our water?
[02:22:19.880 --> 02:22:20.481]  Children?
[02:22:20.481 --> 02:22:21.622]  Our education?
[02:22:21.622 --> 02:22:22.442]  Our money?
[02:22:22.442 --> 02:22:26.085]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:22:26.445 --> 02:22:30.150]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:22:30.150 --> 02:22:31.412]  You're being warned!
[02:22:31.412 --> 02:22:32.453]  We have the facts.
[02:22:32.453 --> 02:22:33.615]  We have the Constitution.
[02:22:33.615 --> 02:22:34.516]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:22:34.516 --> 02:22:35.397]  We have common law.
[02:22:35.397 --> 02:22:37.921]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:37.921 --> 02:22:41.706]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:22:41.806 --> 02:22:43.127]  What is a wind generator?
[02:22:43.127 --> 02:22:44.949]  How can the wind produce power for a small cabin?
[02:23:06.161 --> 02:23:09.512]  How can wind energy be stored and used during an emergency?
[02:23:09.512 --> 02:23:11.479]  Can I assemble my own wind generator?

[02:24:19.304 --> 02:24:22.326]  Okay, I want to go to as many of your calls now as quickly as possible.
[02:24:22.326 --> 02:24:26.568]  Please, a question or comment for Lindsey Williams who's our guest right now.
[02:24:26.568 --> 02:24:29.330]  We've got more stuff we need to go over before he leaves.
[02:24:29.330 --> 02:24:30.890]  Kirk in Illinois, anything else?
[02:24:30.890 --> 02:24:32.271]  Any other questions?
[02:24:32.271 --> 02:24:33.572]  Yeah, I'm glad you had me over.
[02:24:34.929 --> 02:24:47.239]  Yeah, Lindsey, back one year and two days ago, you were on this program and you mentioned that oil, within the next two years, was going to be roughly about the same price.
[02:24:47.239 --> 02:24:52.343]  Also, you mentioned that war was planned after two years, and now you're saying that
[02:24:52.850 --> 02:24:55.132]  They're going to pump that up.
[02:24:55.132 --> 02:25:14.510]  If I remember correctly, Lindsey, it's all on record on his DVDs and from this radio show, he said, enjoy oil prices, they're not going to go up for at least a year, and go on trips and enjoy yourself, because my source told me after that it's going up, and here we are a year later, it's starting to go up.
[02:25:14.510 --> 02:25:15.391]  That's what Lindsey said.
[02:25:15.751 --> 02:25:17.932]  Yes, that's exactly right, Alex.
[02:25:17.932 --> 02:25:18.693]  That's what I said.
[02:25:18.693 --> 02:25:19.834]  I said it on your program.
[02:25:19.834 --> 02:25:22.515]  I recorded it on my DVDs.
[02:25:22.515 --> 02:25:30.321]  And now, of course, I am told by this individual that they are ready to bring the price back up to $150 to $200 a barrel.
[02:25:30.321 --> 02:25:32.002]  And it'll take place in the near future.
[02:25:32.002 --> 02:25:35.684]  You'll see it go back to $4 and $5 a gallon to gas pump.
[02:25:35.684 --> 02:25:36.805]  Kirk, does that answer your question?
[02:25:38.175 --> 02:25:41.917]  Yeah, the last one I had was nearly everyone will be a government employee.
[02:25:41.917 --> 02:25:43.437]  Could you flesh that out a little more?
[02:25:43.437 --> 02:25:50.820]  Well, he means they're going to control the whole system, so even if you're private sector, you'll be beholden to them and be paying checks one way or another to them.
[02:25:50.820 --> 02:25:51.901]  Correct, Lindsey?
[02:25:51.901 --> 02:25:53.281]  Well, let's just take an example.
[02:25:53.281 --> 02:25:54.642]  Your health care bill.
[02:25:54.642 --> 02:26:05.306]  Every doctor, every dentist, every nurse, every hospital, every person that works in the medical profession of any kind will be an employee of the federal government after the health care bill has taken place.
[02:26:05.306 --> 02:26:06.307]  That means that every bank,
[02:26:06.827 --> 02:26:07.327]  This is Howard.
[02:26:07.327 --> 02:26:07.647]  Basically,
[02:26:34.739 --> 02:26:44.464]  Having been just recently awoken to all this tyranny that's around me, having been blind for so many years, this is, like, obviously a big, overwhelming thing.
[02:26:44.464 --> 02:27:00.751]  Considering the direction that we're going in this country, you know, with all of this tyranny, and it's coming down very quickly, how does somebody that's recently awakened, such as myself, hedge himself, whose house he purchased for cash here in Connecticut in 2005, that went down, lost work,
[02:27:03.379 --> 02:27:05.420]  Had to mortgage the house.
[02:27:05.420 --> 02:27:07.801]  Had to lose money in the stock market.
[02:27:07.801 --> 02:27:10.563]  How do I know that I realize all those traps?
[02:27:10.563 --> 02:27:14.765]  How can I better prepare myself for this upcoming tyranny for my family?
[02:27:15.410 --> 02:27:26.918]  Well, you know, it's hard enough to analyze the enemy operations, and then it's even harder to analyze an individual you don't know calling from Connecticut about what your financial situation is, what your local economy's like.
[02:27:26.918 --> 02:27:31.121]  I mean, I don't really give people individual financial advice.
[02:27:31.121 --> 02:27:34.024]  I tell people what I think's coming, what's going on, what's happening.
[02:27:34.024 --> 02:27:35.725]  We have a pretty good track record.
[02:27:35.725 --> 02:27:37.026]  But, Lindsey, what's your take on that?
[02:27:37.973 --> 02:27:43.334]  My suggestion is, and I'm not being facetious at all, listen to the Alex Jones Show every single day.
[02:27:43.334 --> 02:27:45.735]  Don't you dare miss a single program.
[02:27:45.735 --> 02:27:50.175]  Everything he's saying is bringing you up to date as of that minute as to what is happening.
[02:27:50.175 --> 02:27:56.677]  And the best way you can prepare yourself and believe what you're hearing, because you're not going to hear the truth from the national media.
[02:27:56.677 --> 02:28:02.578]  You listen to InfoWare's and Alex Jones' every day, and over a period of time you'll be able to prepare yourself.
[02:28:03.336 --> 02:28:03.676]  I don't know.
[02:28:21.892 --> 02:28:27.218]  I don't know everything, and I'm not omnipresent, so I don't really know what I can say for you to do, Howard.
[02:28:27.218 --> 02:28:28.820]  Just, you know, we need to cut taxes.
[02:28:28.820 --> 02:28:35.207]  If the globalists cut taxes, instead of raising them, that would be the best thing to un-stall the economy, and they know that.
[02:28:36.382 --> 02:28:55.611]  If you'd like to make decisions properly, if you want to know what they're going to do so that you can know what to do next, I plead with you, please get my six DVD set, you probably haven't seen it, and the CD that we're producing today of all this material plus more that I can't give in an hour and a half.
[02:28:55.611 --> 02:28:58.873]  If you'll get these, it'll help you to know what next decision to make.
[02:28:59.056 --> 02:29:00.397]  Well, I mean, knowledge is power.
[02:29:00.397 --> 02:29:01.577]  I appreciate your call, Howard.
[02:29:01.577 --> 02:29:06.279]  We're going to go to break here in a moment and talk to Blake, Sue, David, Mark, and a few others.
[02:29:06.279 --> 02:29:18.825]  We've got to hurry through these calls, Lindsey, and then get to any other facets from your source, any other facets to the issues we've already covered, but a few other issues that we haven't covered.
[02:29:18.825 --> 02:29:22.646]  But when you talk about they really want to have war with Iran the next
[02:29:24.227 --> 02:29:25.408]  Two to three months.
[02:29:25.408 --> 02:29:26.888]  Let me get the exact number here.
[02:29:26.888 --> 02:29:28.849]  Three to four months.
[02:29:28.849 --> 02:29:30.610]  But then you say, but that's not the big issue.
[02:29:30.610 --> 02:29:31.590]  Watch Russia and China.
[02:29:31.590 --> 02:29:39.194]  Well, I mean, if they attack Iran, that is going to be the big issue, at least from my geopolitical and economic perspective.
[02:29:39.194 --> 02:29:41.735]  So we'll talk about it on the other side with Lindsey Williams.
[02:29:41.735 --> 02:29:42.476]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:42.476 --> 02:29:47.018]  This is the one, the only GCN Radio Network, GCNLive.com.
[02:29:47.018 --> 02:29:47.578]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:51.107 --> 02:29:55.049]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.049 --> 02:30:00.871]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.871 --> 02:30:02.512]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:30:02.512 --> 02:30:05.893]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.
[02:30:05.893 --> 02:30:11.095]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.
[02:30:11.095 --> 02:30:14.537]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.
[02:30:14.537 --> 02:30:16.858]  Check them out on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[02:30:17.498 --> 02:30:21.041]  Or call 800-340-7091.
[02:30:21.041 --> 02:30:22.181]  Take my word for it.
[02:30:22.181 --> 02:30:24.823]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[02:30:24.823 --> 02:30:31.348]  Since 1947, Calbin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[02:30:31.348 --> 02:30:32.849]  Buy American and stay clean.

[02:30:53.047 --> 02:30:53.407]  Thank you!
[02:31:00.401 --> 02:31:04.964]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:04.964 --> 02:31:05.865]  Number 1.
[02:31:05.865 --> 02:31:09.308]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.308 --> 02:31:10.168]  Number 2.
[02:31:10.168 --> 02:31:15.052]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:15.052 --> 02:31:15.792]  It's true.
[02:31:15.792 --> 02:31:20.676]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:20.676 --> 02:31:21.497]  Number 3.
[02:31:21.497 --> 02:31:25.079]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.079 --> 02:31:28.782]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:28.982 --> 02:31:29.782]  Number 4.
[02:31:29.782 --> 02:31:32.543]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.543 --> 02:31:36.224]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.224 --> 02:31:37.004]  Number 5.
[02:31:37.004 --> 02:31:41.145]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.145 --> 02:31:46.207]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:46.207 --> 02:31:50.388]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:50.388 --> 02:31:52.169]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:52.169 --> 02:31:56.770]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[02:32:00.573 --> 02:32:04.155]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:32:04.155 --> 02:32:05.456]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:32:05.456 --> 02:32:09.860]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:32:09.860 --> 02:32:15.804]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:32:15.804 --> 02:32:17.946]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:32:17.946 --> 02:32:20.628]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:32:20.968 --> 02:32:27.472]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[02:32:27.472 --> 02:32:29.673]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:32:29.673 --> 02:32:35.016]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:32:35.016 --> 02:32:40.298]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[02:32:40.298 --> 02:32:45.681]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[02:32:45.681 --> 02:32:48.623]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[02:32:48.863 --> 02:32:51.865]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[02:32:51.865 --> 02:32:52.946]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:32:52.946 --> 02:32:57.409]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:19.335 --> 02:33:27.078]  Okay, please have quick questions or comments for Lindsey, because I want to get to everybody and get to some of the other issues he hasn't covered yet from his amazing source.
[02:33:27.078 --> 02:33:29.399]  And the proof's in the pudding from this source.
[02:33:29.399 --> 02:33:37.061]  I also know who the woman is, the big activist, actually is in government, who's been hanging out with Napolitano.
[02:33:37.061 --> 02:33:38.302]  And I said, is this the name?
[02:33:38.302 --> 02:33:40.803]  And he said, yeah, that's her, but she doesn't want her full name out because...
[02:33:41.761 --> 02:33:44.603]  It can hurt some of the other activities she's involved in.
[02:33:44.603 --> 02:33:47.606]  So that's pretty scary that we've confirmed who it is.
[02:33:47.606 --> 02:33:53.791]  Now, before I go any further, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that have made today's radio broadcast possible.
[02:33:53.791 --> 02:33:55.873]  One of them is My Solar Backup.
[02:33:55.873 --> 02:33:58.715]  Have you ever lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[02:33:58.715 --> 02:34:01.797]  If so, you should check out MySolarBackup.com.
[02:34:01.797 --> 02:34:05.721]  There's never been a better time to start getting off the grid and generate your own supply of electricity.
[02:34:06.241 --> 02:34:11.555]  Plug-and-play solar generators that we've been promoting for three years, our listeners love them, are available from Solutions from Science.
[02:34:11.555 --> 02:34:14.803]  These portable power systems need no installation and supply household current.
[02:34:15.629 --> 02:34:19.010]  Wherever and whenever you need it, producing electricity directly from the sun.
[02:34:19.010 --> 02:34:21.952]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly and emits no fumes.
[02:34:21.952 --> 02:34:25.973]  It's like having your own electrical power plant, and it's perfect for your home or your campsite.
[02:34:25.973 --> 02:34:33.937]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, blackouts, or Big Brother trying to spy on you and control your thermostats, it's time to get a MySolar Backup.
[02:34:33.937 --> 02:34:35.457]  Call and get a free information package at 877-327-0365.
[02:34:35.457 --> 02:34:36.358]  That's 877-327-0365 or MySolarBackup.com.
[02:34:42.481 --> 02:34:45.968]  Lastly, I want to tell you about purewaterfreedom.com.
[02:34:45.968 --> 02:34:48.173]  One word, purewaterfreedom.com.
[02:34:50.342 --> 02:34:56.086]  If you want to affordably remove fluoride and other chemicals and toxins from your tap water, visit PureWaterFreedom.com.

[02:35:07.975 --> 02:35:09.817]  All their filters are made in the USA.

[02:35:16.301 --> 02:35:16.922]  That's Pure Water
[02:35:17.182 --> 02:35:27.148]  Freedom.com and we are financed by the support of our sponsors and our listeners and also we just want to thank all of you for the continued support of our sponsors and our local AM and FM sponsors.
[02:35:27.148 --> 02:35:30.710]  Okay, now I want to hurry now here.
[02:35:30.710 --> 02:35:32.851]  Blake in Texas, you're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[02:35:32.851 --> 02:35:33.231]  Go ahead.
[02:35:33.231 --> 02:35:45.438]  Pastor Williams, I have a question about the person who they're calling the religious leader that they want to make a world leader of some sort.
[02:35:46.025 --> 02:35:49.586]  And I've been doing a lot of research on this individual.
[02:35:49.586 --> 02:35:58.009]  I wanted to see if any of your intel, how does it correspond with some of the info that I've gathered on this person.
[02:35:58.009 --> 02:36:13.135]  Jenny Dixon, the American seer or prophetess, when she was asked what her most significant prediction was, she didn't say it was the JFK assassination, where she called the White House, and more.
[02:36:14.162 --> 02:36:22.506]  Or RFK's assassination, where she saw the, you know, she knew what hotel it was going to happen at and the time of day and everything.
[02:36:22.506 --> 02:36:25.948]  She said it was the man born on February 5th, 1962.
[02:36:25.948 --> 02:36:39.015]  Now, she was also, she also said that that, that there would be an individual who came before him, who she characterized as kind of a false prophet of the Antichrist.
[02:36:39.986 --> 02:36:51.113]  She said that that individual, just like the regular, the true prophet, John the Baptist, was born six months before Christ, that the false prophet would also be born six months before.
[02:36:51.113 --> 02:37:08.904]  And if you do the math, it goes back to August, around August 4th, 1962, if you take into account the location that this individual was born, and she said that that individual would become president
[02:37:09.411 --> 02:37:11.992]  I just wanted to see if there was anything like that.
[02:37:11.992 --> 02:37:16.914]  Okay, I know that also this individual specifically, his task is to bring about a spiritual experience in people.
[02:37:16.914 --> 02:37:18.094]  Massive spiritual experience that does not
[02:37:38.432 --> 02:37:48.657]  I'm going to have to let you go unfortunately because I want to hear your question, your comment.
[02:37:48.657 --> 02:37:50.518]  Who are you saying this person is?
[02:37:50.518 --> 02:37:57.222]  What is your question for Lindsey Williams?
[02:37:57.222 --> 02:37:58.983]  So you're just not going to even say anything?
[02:38:00.003 --> 02:38:00.564]  He hung up.
[02:38:00.564 --> 02:38:02.105]  I mean, it's weird.
[02:38:02.105 --> 02:38:03.126]  I've got a guest on.
[02:38:03.126 --> 02:38:04.728]  I want the callers to make their point.
[02:38:04.728 --> 02:38:08.552]  And then it's like they just keep rolling and rolling and rolling and rolling.
[02:38:08.552 --> 02:38:12.315]  And then I just say, who are you talking about or what are you getting at?
[02:38:12.315 --> 02:38:14.137]  And he just laughs and hangs up the phone.
[02:38:14.137 --> 02:38:15.478]  It's bizarre.
[02:38:15.478 --> 02:38:16.519]  And then I'll be bad.
[02:38:16.519 --> 02:38:19.242]  I'll be the Illuminati or something, because I didn't.
[02:38:19.242 --> 02:38:20.624]  It's just so frustrating.
[02:38:21.519 --> 02:38:24.142]  Alex, don't worry about it.
[02:38:24.142 --> 02:38:27.446]  You're doing such a marvelous job, I don't think anybody's gonna question what you're doing.
[02:38:42.529 --> 02:38:44.589]  It is so important.
[02:38:44.589 --> 02:38:48.650]  The Devil's Messiah, you've heard me give it on your program before in-depth.
[02:38:48.650 --> 02:38:54.592]  I wanted to give you one illustration of how they're actually drawing the string right now.
[02:38:54.592 --> 02:39:00.953]  Last weekend, my family and I were up in Yavapai County, which is just north of where we live here in Arizona.
[02:39:00.953 --> 02:39:03.854]  And I was with a pastor called Pastor Possedly.
[02:39:03.854 --> 02:39:05.414]  They've just built a new church building.
[02:39:06.214 --> 02:39:13.037]  And the, they made, Pastor Poseidli made pretty good friends with one of, some of the individuals at the Building and Zoning Board.
[02:39:13.037 --> 02:39:17.538]  Well, he went back in to take care of all of his final paperwork and details the other day.
[02:39:17.538 --> 02:39:18.679]  Now, this was days ago.
[02:39:18.679 --> 02:39:19.759]  This didn't happen months ago.
[02:39:19.759 --> 02:39:21.219]  This happened days ago.
[02:39:21.219 --> 02:39:25.321]  And Pastor Poseidli said, Lindsey, you've got to know what this individual said, too.
[02:39:25.321 --> 02:39:28.082]  He said, in confidence, Pastor, he said, I want to tell you something.
[02:39:28.642 --> 02:39:55.123]  He said Yavapai County has just put in an ordinance stating that if anybody makes a single complaint about your church, they don't like the way your women dress, they don't like the way you sing your singing, we don't care what it is, if any complaint is made about your church to Yavapai County, we have an ordinance now that states that we can come in, padlock the church door, even though you built that building, even though your church owns it, even though it's yours.
[02:39:55.823 --> 02:40:02.027]  We have an ordinance stating one complaint, we can padlock the door, you can never hold another worship service there.
[02:40:02.027 --> 02:40:03.388]  We have a right to do that.
[02:40:03.388 --> 02:40:06.310]  We just want you to be careful so this doesn't happen to you.
[02:40:06.310 --> 02:40:11.334]  The elite, I believe, and by the way, they've already put this also into Maricopa County.
[02:40:11.334 --> 02:40:16.938]  It was in the newspaper about Mesa, Arizona just a few days ago in the Arizona Republic.
[02:40:17.759 --> 02:40:22.009]  I believe that they're putting in this ordinance probably all across America and Hold on!
[02:40:22.009 --> 02:40:22.510]  Hold on!
[02:40:22.510 --> 02:40:22.951]  Hold on!
[02:40:22.951 --> 02:40:23.352]  Excuse me?
[02:40:29.119 --> 02:40:36.886]  Lindsey, specifically, because I didn't know about this and I want to be able to search it so we can pull it up on screen for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[02:40:36.886 --> 02:40:45.133]  Lindsey, specifically, you're saying they're passing ordinances where counties can shut down churches just outside of any process of law.
[02:40:45.133 --> 02:40:50.938]  That sounds like, you know, communist China or something 20 years ago.
[02:40:50.938 --> 02:40:51.819]  Where is this happening?
[02:40:51.819 --> 02:40:52.960]  Is this confirmed?
[02:40:52.960 --> 02:40:54.822]  Give me a search term so I can look this up.
[02:40:55.760 --> 02:40:58.441]  Uh, I will talk with your producer after the show today.
[02:40:58.441 --> 02:41:00.681]  I'll be more than happy to give him the name of the pastor.
[02:41:00.681 --> 02:41:04.922]  He can verify names and Yavapai County and every bit of it you'll have.
[02:41:04.922 --> 02:41:06.642]  How do you spell that?
[02:41:06.642 --> 02:41:09.063]  How do you spell that county?
[02:41:09.063 --> 02:41:11.943]  Uh, I think it's Y-A-V-A-P-A-I.
[02:41:11.943 --> 02:41:13.204]  Y-A?
[02:41:13.204 --> 02:41:15.944]  V-A-P-A-I.
[02:41:15.944 --> 02:41:19.085]  But let me get this correct and then I'll give it to you.
[02:41:19.085 --> 02:41:19.805]  Okay, where is that?
[02:41:22.515 --> 02:41:23.817]  Arizona?
[02:41:23.817 --> 02:41:36.871]  Okay guys, search the term, search the term for the county, ordinance for churches and I'm sure it'll be in the news or it may just be being announced there locally and we'll find out about it soon.
[02:41:36.871 --> 02:41:40.575]  But I mean, Lindsey, specifically, what did he tell you about this religious world leader?
[02:41:40.575 --> 02:41:41.556]  You've talked about this before.
[02:41:41.556 --> 02:41:43.719]  What's the latest on what he calls the devil's messiah?
[02:41:44.895 --> 02:41:49.539]  Well, they are, it's a religious control, basically, that's what we're talking about.
[02:41:49.539 --> 02:42:01.571]  Not only is their program government and political and monetary, such as we've talked about in the mortgage crisis and so on, they definitely have what was referred to me
[02:42:02.191 --> 02:42:20.066]  Back about two years ago, Devil's Messiah, and as a result I did an entire section on it on one of your programs one day, how they're working through 501c3 organizational status with churches, how that it also is in our schools, what they're doing with introducing evolution years ago.
[02:42:20.626 --> 02:42:25.933]  Every bit of this is a part of that total... Okay, basically here's the way he put it.
[02:42:25.933 --> 02:42:34.284]  He said we had to remove the guard that America was founded on from society in order to bring about our New World Order.
[02:42:34.284 --> 02:42:35.225]  That was their statement.
[02:42:38.143 --> 02:42:40.584]  And that's how the devil would do it.
[02:42:40.584 --> 02:42:48.486]  We see the World Council of Churches, the National Council of Churches, openly funded by Carnegie, Ford, and Rockefeller Foundations.
[02:42:48.486 --> 02:43:00.510]  They go in, and now all the big churches, Catholic, a lot of Baptists, Methodists, you know, Bill Gates is good, eugenics is good, open borders is good, you know, the family's bad.
[02:43:00.510 --> 02:43:04.691]  They are turning these into devilish propaganda arms.
[02:43:04.691 --> 02:43:06.712]  And folks, the devil isn't going to show up in a red
[02:43:07.608 --> 02:43:11.069]  Pajamas like Anton LaVey with a little black goatee.
[02:43:11.069 --> 02:43:13.250]  The devil comes as an angel of light.
[02:43:13.250 --> 02:43:19.412]  And whether you believe in God or not, the UN and everybody else at the global level has announced they want a one world religion.
[02:43:19.412 --> 02:43:23.193]  The Pope has announced they want a one world religion, the last one.
[02:43:23.193 --> 02:43:29.935]  And this is the system that is being pushed where they come at you with this world religion.
[02:43:29.935 --> 02:43:35.137]  And they've had Democratic House members talking about this just in the last week, Conyers and others.
[02:43:35.137 --> 02:43:35.477]  And so
[02:43:36.357 --> 02:43:42.719]  There's no doubt with the clergy response teams, they've covertly taken over with the faith-based initiative most of the churches in this country.
[02:43:42.719 --> 02:43:46.180]  And they use the expression to me, Devil's Messiah.
[02:43:46.180 --> 02:43:53.743]  Now, whether you will hear it from another or not, you may not because naturally this is really getting down to the hard core of it.
[02:43:53.743 --> 02:43:57.204]  You have to keep in mind, I've been a minister of the gospel for 50 years.
[02:43:57.204 --> 02:43:57.624]  I'm in my 70s.
[02:43:58.564 --> 02:43:59.325]  Well, of course they've got a...
[02:44:21.606 --> 02:44:24.467]  Of course they've got to go through the back door and take over the churches to do this.
[02:44:24.467 --> 02:44:26.469]  That happens in every authoritarian system.
[02:44:26.469 --> 02:44:34.634]  I wonder if that caller was laughing because he's implying Barack Obama's the Antichrist, but Barack Obama wasn't born in 62 like that guy was saying, if that's who he was talking about.
[02:44:34.634 --> 02:44:36.155]  He was born August 4th, 1961.
[02:44:36.155 --> 02:44:42.158]  And, you know, if he is the devil, he's certainly getting destroyed politically.
[02:44:43.699 --> 02:44:47.802]  It's just, you know, I'm just sticking to the New World Order and what I can prove, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:44:47.802 --> 02:44:48.863]  Let's go back to the calls.
[02:44:48.863 --> 02:44:51.465]  Very interesting information from Lindsey Williams.
[02:44:51.465 --> 02:44:54.307]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Sue in Texas.
[02:44:54.307 --> 02:44:55.948]  Sue, you're on the air.
[02:44:55.948 --> 02:44:57.489]  Hi, Alex and Lindsey.
[02:44:57.489 --> 02:45:00.851]  Thank you for your time, and I'll try to be quick.
[02:45:00.851 --> 02:45:10.938]  While I wonder if a good election result would be able to put a stop to all of this madness that y'all are speaking of, my question is two quick ones.
[02:45:11.721 --> 02:45:17.362]  Will we be able to pay our property taxes with gold if we already own our home?
[02:45:17.362 --> 02:45:23.884]  And number two, can you give an estimated date when the Marshall Law will go into effect?
[02:45:23.884 --> 02:45:26.625]  Alright, let me break that down because I want to get Lindsey's take on it.
[02:45:26.625 --> 02:45:35.427]  It's not that you pay your mortgage in gold, whatever the new currency is, or whatever the devaluation of the dollar is, when you cash the gold or silver in, you will get
[02:45:36.027 --> 02:45:37.848]  What the money's worth at that time.
[02:45:37.848 --> 02:45:42.311]  But if you just save money, it will then be devalued under hyperinflation.
[02:45:42.311 --> 02:45:44.832]  So you'll still be paying for your mortgage in dollars.
[02:45:44.832 --> 02:45:49.435]  It's just now the dollars are sub-denominated in the IMF, World Bank, SDR.
[02:45:49.435 --> 02:45:53.458]  On the subject of martial law, they're turning on the fusion centers nationwide.
[02:45:53.458 --> 02:45:55.139]  The CIA runs them.
[02:45:55.139 --> 02:45:57.720]  They've got the National Guard, regular army in them.
[02:45:57.720 --> 02:45:59.782]  They federalize your police.
[02:45:59.782 --> 02:46:04.785]  They use the cameras and license plate readers and face scanners going in in the town where I live to track everything you're doing.
[02:46:05.405 --> 02:46:06.866]  And it's total tyranny.
[02:46:06.866 --> 02:46:09.007]  So we're already under martial law.
[02:46:09.007 --> 02:46:15.751]  When they're tasering old ladies for no reason, when they're training cops to break people's heads if they talk back to them, this is martial law.
[02:46:15.751 --> 02:46:19.013]  But when will a total collapse and troops rolling out on the streets happen?
[02:46:19.013 --> 02:46:20.213]  Happened at Katrina.
[02:46:20.213 --> 02:46:22.215]  They're beta testing and conditioning.
[02:46:22.215 --> 02:46:23.675]  This is all a creeping death.
[02:46:23.675 --> 02:46:24.256]  Lindsey Williams.
[02:46:25.029 --> 02:46:26.190]  Yes, you're correct.
[02:46:26.190 --> 02:46:30.732]  And I was told by the elitist that by 2012 the dollar will be dead.
[02:46:30.732 --> 02:46:33.013]  Now you say, what will I do about my taxes?
[02:46:33.013 --> 02:46:36.114]  Well, they will have to have something in order to trade with.
[02:46:36.114 --> 02:46:38.536]  You've got to go to the grocery store and buy with something.
[02:46:38.536 --> 02:46:42.518]  Whether it's a new world currency, whatever it may be, a NAFTA currency.
[02:46:42.518 --> 02:46:47.580]  Well, you merely take your gold that has already gone to $3,000 and $4,000 an ounce and turn around and purchase or get.
[02:46:51.642 --> 02:46:52.762]  Sue, does that answer your question?
[02:46:52.762 --> 02:46:53.082]  Pardon me?
[02:46:53.082 --> 02:46:53.263]  Correct.
[02:47:20.163 --> 02:47:21.323]  You can pay them.
[02:47:21.323 --> 02:47:24.144]  At least you have something tangible that you can use.
[02:47:24.144 --> 02:47:28.886]  Where if you have the Federal Reserve note, you won't have anything because it's going to be dead by 2012.
[02:47:28.886 --> 02:47:29.906]  You've lost it.
[02:47:29.906 --> 02:47:33.287]  If you have a pension fund, whatever it may be, it's gone.
[02:47:33.287 --> 02:47:34.267]  But you'll still have that.
[02:47:34.267 --> 02:47:41.109]  And notice all this is happening, this is all happening right as the Federal Reserve Charter ends, so they can start the new system.
[02:47:41.109 --> 02:47:42.049]  Sue, great question.
[02:47:42.049 --> 02:47:43.790]  Dave in Arizona, you're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[02:47:47.461 --> 02:47:49.762]  Okay, maybe Dave doesn't want to talk.
[02:47:49.762 --> 02:47:51.142]  Let's talk to Mark in Texas.
[02:47:51.142 --> 02:47:51.942]  Mark, you're on the air.
[02:47:51.942 --> 02:47:54.403]  All right, can you hear me?
[02:47:54.403 --> 02:47:54.863]  Yes, I can.
[02:47:54.863 --> 02:47:56.123]  Hi, Mark.
[02:47:56.123 --> 02:47:58.284]  Okay, I have two quick questions.
[02:47:58.284 --> 02:48:03.966]  First of all, on the world leader, you're saying these new world globalists, that they have a plan.
[02:48:03.966 --> 02:48:07.006]  So I'm guessing that they probably have a plan when they're going to bring them in.
[02:48:07.006 --> 02:48:09.767]  I'm guessing this is probably after 2012.
[02:48:09.767 --> 02:48:15.949]  My other question is, I've heard, I'm not sure if any of you can confirm this, I heard that Flight 93 is actually still active.
[02:48:17.577 --> 02:48:18.946]  Have any of you heard about that?
[02:48:18.946 --> 02:48:19.248]  Lindsey?
[02:48:20.397 --> 02:48:25.099]  I-593, I don't know about, uh, the world leader.
[02:48:25.099 --> 02:48:27.320]  The Bible does say that he will appear on the scene.
[02:48:27.320 --> 02:48:28.220]  I don't know who he is.
[02:48:28.220 --> 02:48:30.121]  I don't know when he will appear.
[02:48:30.121 --> 02:48:40.824]  I know that, uh, it appears that we have arrived toward the end of it all because the elitists, so they're telling me, are ready to draw the string and put things... Now, I didn't say this two years ago.
[02:48:40.824 --> 02:48:43.045]  Two years ago, I said, you've got two more years.
[02:48:43.045 --> 02:48:44.266]  You don't right now.
[02:48:44.266 --> 02:48:45.906]  They are ready to draw the string.
[02:48:45.906 --> 02:48:48.367]  They are ready to put into force all of their activities.
[02:48:48.922 --> 02:48:56.768]  But God can change that, and people repenting and getting active can change that, so it's not a foregone conclusion, but if we don't take action, it is.
[02:48:56.768 --> 02:49:01.871]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jack in Wisconsin.
[02:49:01.871 --> 02:49:03.432]  You're on the air.
[02:49:03.432 --> 02:49:04.573]  Hi.
[02:49:04.573 --> 02:49:10.837]  In my local area, they've been spraying chemtrails a lot recently, or some kind of aerosol clouds in Kenosha, Racine, and Caledonia.
[02:49:12.176 --> 02:49:24.154]  I just wanted to ask him if he has any kind of insider info on that, and if there's any kind of solution we can take, because most problems we would normally talk to our representatives, but it seems like that may not be the solution here.
[02:49:25.635 --> 02:49:29.596]  This elitist friend of mine has never been willing to get on such subjects as that.
[02:49:29.596 --> 02:49:37.678]  He always sticks with me with the subject of oil, what's happening in the worldwide financial market, what's taking place along those lines.
[02:49:37.678 --> 02:49:47.081]  I have never been able to get him on the subject of chemtrails or containment centers, even though I think they exist.
[02:49:47.081 --> 02:49:49.162]  But they have never been willing to talk about that.
[02:49:49.162 --> 02:49:49.942]  All right, thank you.
[02:49:49.942 --> 02:49:51.702]  Thank you, Jake, not Jack.
[02:49:51.702 --> 02:49:53.403]  William in Michigan, you're on the air.
[02:49:56.303 --> 02:49:56.723]  Hello?
[02:49:56.723 --> 02:49:58.084]  Yes, William.
[02:49:58.084 --> 02:49:59.645]  Oh, yes, sir.
[02:49:59.645 --> 02:50:00.465]  You're awesome, Alex.
[02:50:00.465 --> 02:50:01.526]  I got a question for Lindsey.
[02:50:01.526 --> 02:50:02.607]  I have two houses.
[02:50:02.607 --> 02:50:04.348]  One's been paid off 30 years ago.
[02:50:04.348 --> 02:50:05.688]  One's been paid off 40 years ago.
[02:50:05.688 --> 02:50:06.989]  What's going to happen to them?
[02:50:06.989 --> 02:50:12.052]  And is this cap-and-trade going to come through and try to inspect your house and take it?
[02:50:12.052 --> 02:50:14.754]  Because I haven't got no mortgages against the house.
[02:50:14.754 --> 02:50:16.495]  No, that's all in the legislation.
[02:50:16.495 --> 02:50:23.939]  And there's a federal property tax in the health care bill now that you're going to be hit with.
[02:50:23.939 --> 02:50:25.480]  So they're still going to come after them?
[02:50:26.206 --> 02:50:27.626]  Yeah, but they're not going to get away with it.
[02:50:27.626 --> 02:50:30.687]  I mean, people are really waking up and they've been unable to pass the bill.
[02:50:30.687 --> 02:50:32.447]  They passed it in the House, not the Senate.
[02:50:32.447 --> 02:50:37.468]  So they're just doing it via the EPA.
[02:50:37.468 --> 02:50:38.648]  OK, that's all I want to know.
[02:50:38.648 --> 02:50:39.548]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:50:39.548 --> 02:50:40.068]  Thank you.
[02:50:40.068 --> 02:50:41.709]  And they incentivize it.
[02:50:41.709 --> 02:50:45.589]  Oh, your local city got an EPA or government grant.
[02:50:45.589 --> 02:50:50.090]  Let us inspect your house and we'll give you $500 off on an appliance.
[02:50:50.090 --> 02:50:54.051]  So they're just mainly training their people this is all normal.
[02:50:54.895 --> 02:51:01.317]  Like the Threat Fusion Centers start out with nebulous milquetoast stuff, then they get really wicked.
[02:51:01.317 --> 02:51:05.397]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:05.397 --> 02:51:09.899]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:51:09.899 --> 02:51:16.060]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:51:16.060 --> 02:51:18.501]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:51:18.501 --> 02:51:24.482]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:24.582 --> 02:51:28.003]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:51:28.003 --> 02:51:29.864]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:51:29.864 --> 02:51:32.045]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[02:51:32.045 --> 02:51:36.926]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[02:51:36.926 --> 02:51:37.747]  Guaranteed.

[02:51:48.016 --> 02:51:48.717]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[02:52:00.740 --> 02:52:03.122]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:03.122 --> 02:52:05.423]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:05.423 --> 02:52:08.625]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:08.625 --> 02:52:13.749]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:13.749 --> 02:52:18.272]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.272 --> 02:52:20.613]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:20.613 --> 02:52:23.155]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:23.155 --> 02:52:26.017]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:26.397 --> 02:52:34.021]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.335 --> 02:52:39.719]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:39.719 --> 02:52:42.581]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:42.581 --> 02:52:46.264]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:46.264 --> 02:52:47.345]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:47.345 --> 02:52:48.686]  You're everyone else.
[02:52:48.686 --> 02:52:50.187]  Invisible Empire.

[02:53:48.780 --> 02:53:51.341]  Reduce your foreign oil dependency when you go green with 123cheapsolar.com.
[02:54:06.857 --> 02:54:17.908]  I'm going to talk to Lindsey Williams after the show, but I'm going to be out in California on Monday broadcasting live from one of our great affiliates, KSCO, KSCO.com 1080.
[02:54:17.908 --> 02:54:25.235]  But let's look at your book right now, Lindsey, and let's see about having you on at least for one hour.
[02:54:26.116 --> 02:54:26.657]  I don't
[02:54:42.062 --> 02:54:44.283]  We'll get that done.
[02:54:44.283 --> 02:54:48.746]  Also, they've got 100 tickets, 107 tickets left for the second showing.
[02:54:48.746 --> 02:54:55.369]  The first showing with 800 tickets sold out at the Coconut Grove there in Santa Cruz on Sunday night.
[02:54:55.369 --> 02:54:58.131]  And then there's one on Monday night at 7 o'clock.
[02:54:58.131 --> 02:54:59.852]  And I'm going to speak for two hours, take questions.
[02:54:59.852 --> 02:55:04.575]  I think I'm going to have Dr. Stan Monteef pop by and give a 20-30 minute speech at one of these events because he lives there.
[02:55:05.555 --> 02:55:08.136]  If you want tickets, go to KSCO.com.
[02:55:08.136 --> 02:55:09.777]  And also, MZ has a note here.
[02:55:09.777 --> 02:55:14.258]  He said, you know, they sold out of the first event, but then some people, things come up.
[02:55:14.258 --> 02:55:22.362]  I think he said they had 20 or 30 cancellations and refunds, because, you know, when you've got a group of 800 people coming, some of them have to end up canceling, and they're so nice, they refunded a few of them.
[02:55:22.362 --> 02:55:27.223]  So you'll be able to maybe even buy a few still for the first event or get it at the front door.
[02:55:27.223 --> 02:55:28.044]  Just be there first.
[02:55:28.684 --> 02:55:29.345]  I'm more than happy to.
[02:55:29.345 --> 02:55:29.985]  I'd consider it a privilege.
[02:55:57.028 --> 02:56:01.899]  Well, let's just get you on then at noon central Monday.
[02:56:01.899 --> 02:56:02.801]  Will do.
[02:56:02.801 --> 02:56:03.563]  Consider it done.
[02:56:04.045 --> 02:56:09.948]  I may be having Ventura that day, but he's probably actually Wednesday, so I'll just leave it at that.
[02:56:09.948 --> 02:56:11.169]  We're almost out of time.
[02:56:11.169 --> 02:56:20.513]  If people want to get the new CD you're producing or the past stuff that's very informative, it's prophecyclub.com, and we'll get that number out before you leave.
[02:56:20.513 --> 02:56:27.917]  But Lindsey, in the three minutes or four minutes we've got left, other facets, other things that we didn't cover that this key source told you.
[02:56:29.380 --> 02:56:35.603]  The United States has lost 42,400 factories since 2001.
[02:56:35.603 --> 02:56:38.684]  75% of those factories employ more than 500 people.
[02:56:38.684 --> 02:56:40.505]  And we're talking about NAFTA and GAFTA.
[02:56:40.505 --> 02:56:42.866]  Every bit of this is done by the elitists.
[02:56:42.866 --> 02:56:53.110]  They have talked with me about how they have intentionally moved things out of the United States of America in order to bring about what they yet have to do, which I haven't even talked about today, for instance.
[02:56:53.730 --> 02:57:01.194]  In 2008, 1.2 billion cell phones were sold worldwide with American names on them.
[02:57:01.194 --> 02:57:04.676]  Not one of them was manufactured in the United States of America.
[02:57:04.676 --> 02:57:07.617]  Is this telling you anything about what these elitists are doing?
[02:57:07.617 --> 02:57:12.080]  Dell has announced plans to dramatically expand its plant in China.
[02:57:12.924 --> 02:57:13.806]  So it's total de-industrialization.
[02:57:13.806 --> 02:57:14.848]  Total de-industrialization by design.
[02:57:24.991 --> 02:57:30.152]  Yes, the last television set ever built in the United States of America was Curtis Mathis.
[02:57:30.152 --> 02:57:32.773]  They are now gone and have closed down their plant.
[02:57:32.773 --> 02:57:35.253]  Folks, watch Russia and China.
[02:57:35.253 --> 02:57:41.975]  If China ever decides to close down what they sell to Walmart, you won't have anything on the grocery store shelves.
[02:57:41.975 --> 02:57:44.836]  That's the reason these people made it so plain to me.
[02:57:44.836 --> 02:57:46.236]  Watch Russia and China.
[02:57:46.696 --> 02:57:48.677]  I know these other things are important.
[02:57:48.677 --> 02:57:56.781]  Folks, we are facing some things in America that you need to prepare for, and Alex is helping you do that through his program every day.
[02:57:56.781 --> 02:58:12.349]  Well, if you were going to bring down the United States to fold it into a one-world tyrannical government, you would have to do it by stealth and over time and de-industrialize and break up the family and build up a huge paramilitary force against the people and make them so poor they're dependent and bankrupt their financial system.
[02:58:12.349 --> 02:58:12.870]  They've done it.
[02:58:13.850 --> 02:58:16.091]  And it's just total evil.
[02:58:16.091 --> 02:58:25.294]  In the first hour coming up at InfoWars.com, Fox News admits Al Qaeda leader dined at Pentagon just months after 9-11, Anwar al-Awlaki.
[02:58:25.294 --> 02:58:27.955]  That is coming up with Paul Watson and Wayne Madsen.
[02:58:27.955 --> 02:58:29.956]  This is an unbelievable first hour.
[02:58:29.956 --> 02:58:31.577]  Please get this info out to everybody.
[02:58:31.577 --> 02:58:34.598]  The story's up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:58:34.598 --> 02:58:37.059]  And again, fire that number out real fast.
[02:58:37.059 --> 02:58:38.259]  Well, you know, we're out of time.
[02:58:38.259 --> 02:58:39.439]  Lindsay, I'll see you Monday.
[02:58:39.439 --> 02:58:40.240]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:58:40.240 --> 02:58:41.020]  I'll talk to you after the show.
