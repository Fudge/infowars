[00:00:07.276 --> 00:00:08.583]  We are simulcasting.
[00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:17.971]  This syndicated radio transmission right now.
[00:00:18.011 --> 00:00:21.874]  We just started simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:00:22.154 --> 00:00:25.016]  It's a four-hour radio show every day if you're a new listener or viewer.
[00:00:26.017 --> 00:00:29.120]  And we always in the third and fourth hour simulcast.
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.122]  But a lot of days we do the first, second, third, and fourth.
[00:00:32.162 --> 00:00:36.145]  Many days we do the second, third, and fourth.
[00:00:36.165 --> 00:00:37.767]  But today we're doing two and a half hours.
[00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:39.167]  of course.
[00:00:58.504 --> 00:01:00.546]  And so you can share with a few of your friends and family.
[00:01:00.586 --> 00:01:09.852]  If they give it out to too many people, though, and six people are logged on with the same passcode at the same time streaming and downloading videos, it'll lock you out until one of the people gets off.
[00:01:09.892 --> 00:01:15.437]  But as long as we can finance it, we do want people to be able to share the information.
[00:01:15.457 --> 00:01:18.259]  I mean, if I could, I would just get PrisonPlanet.tv out for free.
[00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:26.385]  But we finance the radio show, the films, a lot of what we do from the members of PrisonPlanet.tv, and we post them there in the highest quality.
[00:01:27.165 --> 00:01:28.226]  We post them there first.
[00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:33.168]  The day we start shipping a new film out on DVD, it's available first at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:01:33.188 --> 00:01:37.991]  We simulcast the radio show there, the document cam, the video clips, all of it.
[00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:40.592]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:01:41.112 --> 00:01:44.374]  And I want to encourage people, if you want to financially support what we're doing, to do that.
[00:01:45.795 --> 00:01:49.517]  Last night when I was out at the protest, a lady gave me a large donation and I gave it to my crew.
[00:01:50.217 --> 00:01:53.238]  I hope that's okay with her, but it really touched my heart that she did that.
[00:01:53.278 --> 00:01:56.919]  We don't really, generally, maybe once a year we will do a drive and ask for donations.
[00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:58.099]  That's a listener idea.
[00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.401]  We've done that two years and that's really helped our operations, given us the confidence to expand.
[00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:13.123]  But the big way to donate and support us is buying the books, the videos, the t-shirts that are all massively discounted at InfoWars.com or getting a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[00:02:13.463 --> 00:02:15.544]  Now, for the balance of the hour,
[00:02:16.144 --> 00:02:21.848]  We are joined by Pastor David Manning of ATLA.org, ATLA World Church.
[00:02:22.768 --> 00:02:24.630]  They're in New York City.
[00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:25.430]  They're in Harlem.
[00:02:26.431 --> 00:02:30.774]  And Reverend Manning has, again, tens of millions of views online.
[00:02:30.834 --> 00:02:32.235]  National television has covered him.
[00:02:32.395 --> 00:02:33.676]  Ad Nauseam attacked him.
[00:02:34.176 --> 00:02:34.937]  He got a visit.
[00:02:35.757 --> 00:02:37.358]  What was it, a month and a half ago or so?
[00:02:37.378 --> 00:02:38.279]  Back in November.
[00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:46.845]  Back in November by the, boy time flies, by the, two months ago, by the Secret Service and saying they were also CIA with New York Police.
[00:02:47.245 --> 00:02:52.749]  So I wanted to get caught up to speed on what, what happened there because you were expecting to be arrested.
[00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:55.611]  But thank God that hasn't happened yet because you're so visible.
[00:02:55.951 --> 00:02:58.173]  But a recap what happened there and any new developments.
[00:02:58.733 --> 00:02:59.254]  Reverend Manning.
[00:02:59.983 --> 00:03:02.464]  Well, they did come on the 16th of November.
[00:03:02.484 --> 00:03:04.885]  And by the way, thank you, Alex, for having me on your broadcast today.
[00:03:04.945 --> 00:03:06.806]  It's a real pleasure and honor.
[00:03:09.127 --> 00:03:11.308]  They were here on the 16th of November.
[00:03:11.328 --> 00:03:12.348]  They unannounced.
[00:03:12.388 --> 00:03:14.569]  They kind of burst in on me.
[00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:16.610]  I had no idea they were coming.
[00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.751]  Could not be prepared for them.
[00:03:19.152 --> 00:03:26.276]  But they came up—CIA, Secret Service, Homeland Security, and New York City Community Services Police.
[00:03:26.437 --> 00:03:29.879]  Now, that's a nice way of saying riot control, crowd control.
[00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:31.560]  Police Department.
[00:03:32.581 --> 00:03:38.124]  They came into my study, where I happened to have been doing business at the time.
[00:03:40.326 --> 00:03:46.450]  And, of course, they asked me about the question that stated—something that I had stated—to kill the president.
[00:03:48.017 --> 00:03:58.562]  Well, I explained to them, and they were very well aware of the fact that what I stated was that I believe Obama is an illegal alien, that he should be put on trial for treason, found guilty, and executed.
[00:03:58.582 --> 00:03:59.802]  That's exactly what I said.
[00:03:59.822 --> 00:04:03.364]  And they were taken from a quote that I posted up on YouTube.
[00:04:04.664 --> 00:04:06.025]  And I explained that to them.
[00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:10.747]  Of course, I also explained that I didn't have anything to say to them if I was not under arrest.
[00:04:11.794 --> 00:04:14.015]  And so they left.
[00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:29.578]  Now, of course, there's a bit more detail, but I've explained this once, and I thought I'd just kind of—I have since that time sent a letter, an official letter, to Janet Napolitano complaining about that intrusion by her Homeland Security group.
[00:04:30.438 --> 00:04:33.359]  I've sent a letter to the New York City Police Department, as well.
[00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:34.819]  None of them have responded.
[00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:36.620]  But I'm asking for answers.
[00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:37.340]  Why did they come?
[00:04:38.471 --> 00:04:39.392]  Reverend Manning, I mean,
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.702]  I think you're a good guy.
[00:05:06.722 --> 00:05:07.684]  I like you.
[00:05:08.025 --> 00:05:09.669]  And I think you have a lot of courage.
[00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.898]  Me, personally, I think Obama's just a powerful puppet of the New World Order.
[00:05:15.612 --> 00:05:19.193]  To give left cover to new wars and police state and banker bailouts.
[00:05:20.073 --> 00:05:22.153]  But I also expose Bush as a puppet.
[00:05:22.653 --> 00:05:30.215]  I mean, I think that if Obama got arrested and tried for, I mean, for treason, I mean, it's all the power backers that back him.
[00:05:30.575 --> 00:05:40.417]  That would turn him into some type of hero and some type of victim if, I mean, that makes it all about the president.
[00:05:40.437 --> 00:05:44.438]  But I guess from your research, you think Obama is really running the show?
[00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.951]  Well, no.
[00:05:46.151 --> 00:05:49.675]  I mean, I think I agree with you inasmuch as that he is indeed a puppet.
[00:05:49.695 --> 00:05:50.976]  There's no doubt about that.
[00:05:52.077 --> 00:05:54.380]  And there are those who pull the string.
[00:05:55.421 --> 00:06:03.210]  From my point of view, I suspect that someone has to start being accountable at some point, at some level.
[00:06:04.684 --> 00:06:05.966]  And he is visible.
[00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:13.932]  Of course, those who pull the strings, those who have been pulling the strings, I completely agree with you regarding George Bush.
[00:06:13.952 --> 00:06:17.736]  I don't think that Obama could be president without George Bush.
[00:06:17.796 --> 00:06:27.824]  I think George Bush and John McCain handed Obama the presidency because of the pulling of the strings from higher up and from various organizations that have been pulling strings for quite some time.
[00:06:27.864 --> 00:06:28.785]  No doubt about that.
[00:06:29.818 --> 00:06:41.471]  However, in my view, I think Obama needs to be brought, held accountable, and like Abdulmutallab, maybe he'll start talking on those who actually put him up to put the explosive in his underwear.
[00:06:41.672 --> 00:06:45.116]  Maybe Obama will tell us who put the explosive in his underwear.
[00:06:45.436 --> 00:06:46.938]  But I also think that Obama
[00:06:47.738 --> 00:07:04.043]  In a large sense, Alex has influenced people, especially in the black community, and others as well, in a way that's perhaps very spiritually evil, and that needs to be rectified as well.
[00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:08.511]  I mean, give us the Bill of Particulars.
[00:07:08.591 --> 00:07:10.233]  What is the treason Obama's committing?
[00:07:10.253 --> 00:07:24.508]  I mean, the bank's robbing us, letting Geithner and others keep the money for themselves, keeping it secret, lying about what the health care plan really did, unconstitutional, launching new wars, going into Pakistan.
[00:07:27.008 --> 00:07:30.671]  All of that, all of that is a part of what he is doing.
[00:07:30.691 --> 00:07:45.045]  It may not necessarily be considered treason, because there are certain mandates constitutionally, executive privileges in power and congressional powers legislatively, that he is able, as the Commander-in-Chief, that he is able to do those things.
[00:07:45.725 --> 00:07:52.170]  You may be able to bring a moral case against him for the wars that he has continued.
[00:07:53.711 --> 00:07:58.694]  But the banking idea, the bailout for the banks, you can bring a moral argument against that as well.
[00:07:59.314 --> 00:08:01.896]  My specific treason charges are as simple.
[00:08:02.848 --> 00:08:05.989]  It's the fact that he is not a U.S.
[00:08:06.029 --> 00:08:18.853]  citizen constitutionally eligible to hold the office, that he does not fit the constitutional bill of Section 2, Article 1—Article 2, rather, rather, Section A of the Constitution to actually serve as U.S.
[00:08:18.893 --> 00:08:19.373]  president.
[00:08:19.853 --> 00:08:32.423]  There's a lot of information floating around and questions floating around that are just absolutely unprecedented and unreasonably answers being withheld regarding his birth.
[00:08:32.743 --> 00:08:41.850]  But I've got something else, Alex, I want to talk to you about, as well, with respect to his education at Columbia University, or the alleged education at Columbia University.
[00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:48.555]  But it is the fact that he is constitutionally ineligible that makes him a treasonous target.
[00:08:50.205 --> 00:09:02.492]  Well, there's also the treason trying to hand us over at Copenhagen to United Nations control and to give part of our GDP and other forms of taxes to the IMF and World Bank.
[00:09:02.532 --> 00:09:04.553]  I mean, if that isn't treason, I don't know what is.
[00:09:05.794 --> 00:09:14.740]  Well, you're absolutely right, and that's one of the reasons why I keep following your reports on where our world is going and who's actually calling the shots.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:24.786]  It appeared that the Copenhagen World Climate Change, the global warming event, seemed to have fizzled.
[00:09:24.906 --> 00:09:25.667]  I don't think so.
[00:09:25.687 --> 00:09:30.390]  I would never think that those people are as powerful as they are would allow it to have fizzled.
[00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:32.171]  They're regrouping for whatever reason.
[00:09:32.551 --> 00:09:33.552]  But it appeared to me
[00:09:34.332 --> 00:09:35.353]  Oh, they've clearly already...
[00:09:56.175 --> 00:09:57.116]  I mean, he's the first U.S.
[00:09:57.156 --> 00:09:59.457]  president to become the chair of the U.N.
[00:09:59.477 --> 00:10:00.358]  Security Council.
[00:10:00.378 --> 00:10:00.878]  Absolutely.
[00:10:01.158 --> 00:10:03.740]  That clearly violates the Constitution.
[00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:18.329]  We give the article sections in Fall of the Republic, and clearly he's trying to cede authority unconstitutionally, and then that is the definition of treason, is to swear an oath and then sell your country out to foreign interest.
[00:10:18.763 --> 00:10:20.705]  No, you're absolutely right about that, no doubt about that.
[00:10:21.345 --> 00:10:29.192]  And that's perhaps a more grievous one, because then the insidiousness of actually doing that and conspiring with other nations.
[00:10:30.113 --> 00:10:36.498]  So he would have had to have started on this process quite some time ago, not during the election cycle.
[00:10:36.998 --> 00:10:47.167]  But those who are pulling the strings on his presidency and him as a puppet would have had to have thought about this years ago more than just recently.
[00:10:48.866 --> 00:10:49.508]  Absolutely.
[00:10:51.013 --> 00:10:55.748]  Expanding along those lines, Obama has the lowest approval rating of any president
[00:10:56.824 --> 00:11:05.031]  One year in office in history, and he got that record eight months in, but it continues to slide at record levels.
[00:11:05.051 --> 00:11:12.297]  I mean, he's plunging in freefall right now, and everything he's doing is falling apart, but he doesn't care.
[00:11:12.337 --> 00:11:18.762]  And now he has announced, and his former head of cybersecurity resigned and said, the Pentagon is covertly taking over the Internet.
[00:11:19.263 --> 00:11:20.303]  And then Obama came out.
[00:11:20.504 --> 00:11:20.964]  It was CNET News.
[00:11:22.285 --> 00:11:30.153]  You name it, and said, we may shut the web down to protect it, and we are feeding everything through these NSA hubs now.
[00:11:30.633 --> 00:11:34.857]  I mean, that's treason against the Constitution, and dwarfs George Bush's illegal spying.
[00:11:34.897 --> 00:11:39.481]  But again, it's just the progression of these puppets carrying out this agenda.
[00:11:40.142 --> 00:11:46.808]  And I remember you a year ago saying that the government and Obama were going to go after free speech, and now Cass Sunstein
[00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.629]  The
[00:12:09.381 --> 00:12:10.142]  Outrageous.
[00:12:11.143 --> 00:12:12.064]  I'm even blown away.
[00:12:12.544 --> 00:12:12.944]  You're right.
[00:12:12.984 --> 00:12:23.614]  You know, you first started this segment, we're talking about his popularity ratings are in the toilet, if you will, and going deeper.
[00:12:24.835 --> 00:12:28.219]  But Alex, I have to tell you, I don't believe he cares about his ratings right now.
[00:12:28.319 --> 00:12:34.765]  I think there has been such a conspiracy to control this nation and other
[00:12:35.507 --> 00:12:36.408]  No, you're right.
[00:12:36.448 --> 00:12:37.468]  I mean, he's on a mission.
[00:12:37.528 --> 00:12:39.229]  They are sprinting for the finish line.
[00:12:39.529 --> 00:12:40.210]  Right, right.
[00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.231]  So his popularity is not an issue with him.
[00:12:42.291 --> 00:12:45.613]  It may be an issue with someone who's naive about what's happening, but not with him.
[00:12:45.953 --> 00:12:48.935]  They are in control and they're going to shut down.
[00:12:49.735 --> 00:12:51.656]  I expect, I know that I'm tapped.
[00:12:51.716 --> 00:12:53.137]  I know that I'm listening to everything.
[00:12:53.237 --> 00:12:56.259]  I think the reason why, and I didn't make that clear earlier,
[00:12:57.003 --> 00:12:59.244]  That the Secret Service came to visit me.
[00:12:59.284 --> 00:13:01.445]  They wanted me to know you were being watched, boy.
[00:13:01.545 --> 00:13:03.726]  And we've got you on our line.
[00:13:04.487 --> 00:13:06.968]  And everything you say and do, we're monitoring.
[00:13:07.008 --> 00:13:08.349]  I think they wanted me to know that.
[00:13:09.049 --> 00:13:11.050]  And they're doing that with a whole lot of people.
[00:13:13.371 --> 00:13:16.613]  And it's completely unconstitutional and it's outrageous.
[00:13:16.693 --> 00:13:21.716]  I mean, you've always called for nonviolence and you're not calling for any violence against anybody.
[00:13:22.076 --> 00:13:23.977]  You're simply saying this is treason.
[00:13:24.835 --> 00:13:25.375]  Absolutely.
[00:13:26.035 --> 00:13:28.996]  And I think the American people need to wake up.
[00:13:29.596 --> 00:13:46.680]  We still have a slither of a chance to regain this nation, and we can go after the Illuminati, we can go after the Bilderbergs, we can go after the power sources that are controlling our planet right now.
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.321]  We can go after them if we wake up, but if we don't,
[00:13:52.807 --> 00:14:00.494]  I think right now the internet is perhaps the most powerful tool that can be used to stop what's happening in our nation.
[00:14:00.554 --> 00:14:03.937]  And we better appreciate it and we better use it right now while we still got it.
[00:14:04.578 --> 00:14:05.199]  We certainly better.
[00:14:05.659 --> 00:14:11.084]  But you know, waking up the American people is a major task, as I'm sure you are very much aware of.
[00:14:11.665 --> 00:14:14.407]  We're going to need the support and the awakeness of the American people.
[00:14:14.427 --> 00:14:15.669]  Do you know who Mark Dice is?
[00:14:17.745 --> 00:14:24.358]  Well, we'll go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and I believe the headline is... What's our headline on our article about that?
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:30.028]  It's... Mark Dice... What's the headline?
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.262]  Clueless in California, Mark Dice gets people to sign a petition to ban the First Amendment.
[00:14:35.523 --> 00:14:40.165]  And he said, we want to ban free speech, ban people's right to criticize Obama in any way.
[00:14:40.465 --> 00:14:44.067]  And the majority of them signed the petition and read it and signed it.
[00:14:44.468 --> 00:14:47.830]  I mean, now that's Southern California, but that is zombie-like.
[00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:50.131]  I mean, that is the opposite of freedom.
[00:14:50.171 --> 00:14:51.532]  These people are dangerous.
[00:14:51.952 --> 00:14:53.214]  No, you're absolutely right.
[00:14:53.774 --> 00:14:55.476]  And it's only going to get worse.
[00:14:56.537 --> 00:15:06.429]  And then I've got you guys, what I refer to as the dunghead media, others refer to them as mainstream media, who also are part of this process, whether or not they're being
[00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:09.050]  We're good to go.
[00:15:31.499 --> 00:15:32.560]  Well, it's worse than that.
[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:50.190]  In Vermont, of all places, in Illinois, in Missouri, and we have clips of it in Fall of the Republic, Dr. Manning, and I don't know if you've seen the film, I should send you a copy, where they said we're truth squads and that state officials and
[00:15:51.812 --> 00:15:56.455]  Local DAs were on TV saying, if you lie about Obama, we're going to indict you.
[00:15:56.835 --> 00:16:00.497]  Not, Obama can sue you if it's proven to be a lie later.
[00:16:00.537 --> 00:16:12.885]  They said, if we see ads questioning him, and they said, he's a Christian, he wants to cut your taxes, and that's a quote, and if you disagree with that, you're going to go to jail.
[00:16:13.105 --> 00:16:17.448]  They really were testing to see if they could just say, sit down and shut up.
[00:16:17.508 --> 00:16:19.249]  And people need to take this seriously.
[00:16:19.569 --> 00:16:21.070]  I mean, these people mean business.
[00:16:21.795 --> 00:16:22.455]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:16:22.495 --> 00:16:23.375]  There's no doubt about it.
[00:16:24.716 --> 00:16:29.417]  Perhaps more so than the average person can fathom, and that's one of the reasons why people still wait.
[00:16:29.457 --> 00:16:30.017]  Yeah, I'm aware.
[00:16:30.037 --> 00:16:31.038]  I follow the Republican.
[00:16:31.058 --> 00:16:33.398]  I'm aware of that statement.
[00:16:34.899 --> 00:16:38.700]  They not only mean business, Alex, but they're in control.
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.321]  They're riding this wave of power that they have, and they are not intimidated.
[00:16:43.341 --> 00:16:45.381]  I mean, who are you going to send to stop them?
[00:16:45.902 --> 00:16:46.182]  You know?
[00:16:46.202 --> 00:16:49.683]  I mean, who are you going to call the Marines and tell them to go after these people?
[00:16:49.703 --> 00:16:50.703]  Who are you going to send?
[00:16:51.437 --> 00:16:53.319]  Well, that's the issue, is that you're right.
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:54.841]  They know they've got power.
[00:16:54.941 --> 00:16:55.582]  They don't care.
[00:16:55.622 --> 00:16:56.322]  They're robbing us.
[00:16:56.342 --> 00:16:57.704]  They're setting up a police state.
[00:16:58.605 --> 00:17:00.707]  And it's just getting worse and worse and worse.
[00:17:01.788 --> 00:17:06.393]  Well, I think there is, as you stated, the Internet is a powerful tool right now.
[00:17:06.413 --> 00:17:10.398]  They can be at least stopped.
[00:17:11.534 --> 00:17:11.754]  I think?
[00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:42.515]  It's stunning.
[00:17:42.555 --> 00:17:43.115]  Stay there.
[00:17:44.035 --> 00:17:46.537]  Reverend Manning, we're going to give you his website and more.
[00:17:46.837 --> 00:17:50.579]  He of course has a radio show as well on the other side of this quick break.
[00:17:50.599 --> 00:17:51.459]  He has a lot of courage.
[00:17:51.479 --> 00:17:52.559]  You've got to admire that.
[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.861]  We're going to come back after this break with Reverend Manning.
[00:17:55.881 --> 00:17:56.241]  Stay with us.
[00:17:58.533 --> 00:17:59.794]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:17:59.834 --> 00:18:05.159]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:18:05.419 --> 00:18:10.043]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:18:10.444 --> 00:18:15.508]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:18:16.029 --> 00:18:20.713]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:18:21.226 --> 00:18:28.152]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:18:28.352 --> 00:18:29.253]  And here's the best part.
[00:18:29.473 --> 00:18:35.838]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:18:36.158 --> 00:18:39.000]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:18:39.341 --> 00:18:41.222]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[00:18:42.663 --> 00:18:42.924]  Remember,
[00:18:51.277 --> 00:18:54.879]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:18:55.199 --> 00:18:57.640]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[00:20:02.455 --> 00:20:04.237]  No More Mortgage can change your life.
[00:20:04.317 --> 00:20:05.658]  We paid off all of our bills.

[00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:14.104]  With No More Mortgage, we will have saved over $313,000 in interest payments.
[00:20:14.184 --> 00:20:15.785]  Even have more money left over each month?
[00:20:15.865 --> 00:20:18.427]  It lowered our monthly payments by a little over $500.
[00:20:18.467 --> 00:20:18.928]  No More Mortgage.
[00:20:20.969 --> 00:20:22.189]  Where have they been all of our life?
[00:20:22.249 --> 00:20:24.670]  If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody.

[00:20:52.256 --> 00:20:53.757]  Day after day.
[00:20:53.777 --> 00:20:55.238]  Alone on a hill.
[00:20:55.258 --> 00:21:03.422]  The man with the foolish dream.
[00:21:03.442 --> 00:21:10.186]  Alright, here's the deal.
[00:21:10.366 --> 00:21:15.109]  Reverend Manning's gonna be with us 30 minutes into the next hour.
[00:21:15.149 --> 00:21:17.491]  You'll get a chance to talk to him, and I'm in a news blitz.
[00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:23.874]  Play a bunch of audio and video clips and break down a whole bunch of really important news we haven't gotten to yet.
[00:21:23.894 --> 00:21:27.356]  I've spoken some about it, but I want to spend more time about the Supreme Court ruling.
[00:21:27.376 --> 00:21:42.406]  I wanted to actually go read the ruling, and it says, I thought, let's corporations give all the money they want, but it appears that the limitations, because they write these vague so they can expand their power, are still on private individuals giving money, but not on corporations.
[00:21:42.426 --> 00:21:44.027]  I mean, this is a perfect storm of evil.
[00:21:44.948 --> 00:21:45.749]  That is coming up.
[00:21:45.769 --> 00:21:46.649]  The latest on Haiti.
[00:21:49.207 --> 00:21:55.831]  Now listen, every time I have a special guest on and I say it's specifically for questions for them, people call in about anything but.
[00:21:56.311 --> 00:21:58.092]  We do this maybe once or twice a week.
[00:21:58.112 --> 00:22:04.396]  I say, for this guest, if you want to talk to them, specifically questions about what they're doing or questions to them, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:22:04.416 --> 00:22:04.496]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:22:04.516 --> 00:22:07.438]  We'll have open phones later on whatever issues you want to talk about.
[00:22:07.458 --> 00:22:09.299]  But right now it's for Reverend Manning.
[00:22:09.379 --> 00:22:10.120]  Reverend Manning,
[00:22:19.325 --> 00:22:23.868]  Looking at this country and all the lies, and we've really got 20 plus percent unemployment.
[00:22:23.888 --> 00:22:24.268]  They say it's 10.2.
[00:22:24.829 --> 00:22:27.631]  They tell us the economy's getting better when it's clearly getting worse.
[00:22:27.731 --> 00:22:34.575]  They are just openly attacking the Second Amendment on every front, while then saying, we don't want your guns.
[00:22:34.635 --> 00:22:37.997]  But then all these White Houses are saying they want a total ban on guns.
[00:22:38.477 --> 00:22:40.979]  All these White Houses are openly saying they like Mao.
[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:43.581]  But they're not communists.
[00:22:44.741 --> 00:22:45.922]  They're just a bunch of crooks.
[00:22:49.097 --> 00:22:55.558]  And then meanwhile you're getting demonized in the media calling this treason, but you are seeing an awakening out there.
[00:22:55.919 --> 00:23:01.700]  Are you worried though that Republicans are co-opting the Tea Parties and basically defanging them?
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.640]  Let me ask you a last question first.
[00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:15.083]  I am convinced that the Tea Party is a controlled opposition, perhaps more conspiratorial than the puppet masters that are pulling Obama's string.
[00:23:15.323 --> 00:23:16.003]  I mean, it is
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:28.222]  It is horrendous to watch Americans go down the primrose path of thinking somehow or another the Tea Party group is going to change Washington in any way whatsoever.
[00:23:29.167 --> 00:23:42.337]  But the other thing I think that I'm also noticing in America, and a lot of criticism has been leveled at me, that I am a person that's advocating overthrow the government through violent means.
[00:23:42.477 --> 00:23:48.142]  Of course, the Constitution does provide under the right circumstances to overthrow tyranny.
[00:23:48.162 --> 00:23:50.304]  Declaration of Independence, sure.
[00:23:50.664 --> 00:23:52.245]  Yes.
[00:23:52.846 --> 00:23:58.110]  But a number, because I have been stating that I sense in America
[00:23:58.852 --> 00:24:03.013]  A number of people feel that they have been pushed to the limits.
[00:24:03.747 --> 00:24:06.028]  Of their sense of being an American.
[00:24:06.048 --> 00:24:07.549]  They've been pushed to the limits.
[00:24:07.569 --> 00:24:12.232]  Their freedoms are being curtailed, if not being taken completely, and being marginalized.
[00:24:12.412 --> 00:24:21.177]  Big business is being given the slogan, too big to fail, while poor people are failing, or everyday working people are failing and being foreclosed.
[00:24:21.637 --> 00:24:29.282]  And I've been stating that the only way that we can clean house, not only must we remove Obama,
[00:24:29.949 --> 00:24:37.034]  But we must remove the power system and the structure that allows him to function, and the puppet masters.
[00:24:37.154 --> 00:24:39.275]  And that requires a revolution.
[00:24:39.415 --> 00:24:41.657]  I mean, it isn't just about moving Obama.
[00:24:41.977 --> 00:24:45.900]  You take out George Bush and put in Obama, and you've got the same problems going on.
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:50.583]  You take out Obama and put in anybody else, unless the entire system is clean.
[00:24:51.123 --> 00:24:52.344]  And that takes a revolution.
[00:24:52.844 --> 00:24:57.527]  And people have stated, well, I'm advocating violence, that I'm about a violent spirit.
[00:24:57.748 --> 00:24:59.669]  And therefore, people like the Tea Party people,
[00:25:00.898 --> 00:25:06.440]  I was invited to speak at the Tea Party event on 9-12 in Washington, D.C.
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:07.721]  a couple of weeks before the event.
[00:25:08.141 --> 00:25:16.764]  They called me up and canceled me and stated that I'm too incendiary, I'm too fiery, that I'm advocating violence and overthrow of the government.
[00:25:17.264 --> 00:25:18.665]  And on and on and on they went.
[00:25:19.845 --> 00:25:22.306]  But that's where we are with that process right now.
[00:25:22.446 --> 00:25:26.808]  And the truth of the matter is, the House, America must be clean.
[00:25:26.848 --> 00:25:29.029]  There must be a revolution in this nation, Alex.
[00:25:29.737 --> 00:25:32.140]  Well, but the question is what type of revolution?
[00:25:32.721 --> 00:25:38.628]  I mean, there's no doubt there's been a globalist revolution overthrowing our republic.
[00:25:38.648 --> 00:25:43.214]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:25:48.046 --> 00:25:52.289]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:56.653]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:25:56.933 --> 00:26:02.338]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:26:02.678 --> 00:26:03.139]  It's true.
[00:26:03.439 --> 00:26:07.983]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:26:08.283 --> 00:26:08.824]  Number 3.
[00:26:09.104 --> 00:26:12.387]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:26:12.687 --> 00:26:16.430]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:26:16.611 --> 00:26:17.171]  Number 4.
[00:26:17.411 --> 00:26:19.773]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:26:20.174 --> 00:26:23.577]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:26:23.857 --> 00:26:24.077]  Number 5.
[00:26:24.658 --> 00:26:28.581]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:26:28.782 --> 00:26:33.566]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:45.231]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:26:45.251 --> 00:26:46.451]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:26:46.471 --> 00:26:46.831]  Big Brother.
[00:27:03.971 --> 00:27:07.673]  Halfway into this worldwide transmission against tyranny.
[00:27:24.787 --> 00:27:31.212]  And we have Reverend James Manning of atla.org joining us, Pastor David, James David Manning.
[00:27:31.232 --> 00:27:36.015]  Again, atla.org, A-T-L-A-H dot O-R-G.
[00:27:36.095 --> 00:27:38.918]  Our websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[00:27:39.258 --> 00:27:45.663]  In the next segment, we're going to open the phones up to Pat, Julio, Isaac, Tracy, Mark, and others to talk to the pastor.
[00:27:46.929 --> 00:27:59.945]  Look, when you talk about revolution, they know they're forcing the people into physical confrontation, so they built up NORTHCOM, Homeland Security, to get everybody used to giving up their rights to fight foreign, supposed made-up, boogeyman terrorists.
[00:28:00.666 --> 00:28:05.952]  But really, we have the Homeland Security Mike reports, it's all designed for the American people, libertarians, conservatives.
[00:28:06.773 --> 00:28:09.816]  People that want to end the Fed, the birthers.
[00:28:09.836 --> 00:28:11.598]  I mean, it's all in there.
[00:28:11.938 --> 00:28:13.600]  People want to get us out of the UN sticker.
[00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:14.661]  It's clearly un-American.
[00:28:14.701 --> 00:28:15.922]  It's clearly a secret police.
[00:28:16.623 --> 00:28:18.264]  But I think they want
[00:28:19.421 --> 00:28:19.461]  Uh,
[00:28:49.541 --> 00:28:50.342]  He's Benedict Arnold.
[00:28:50.362 --> 00:28:52.124]  I mean, I have to call him out because he's so dangerous.
[00:28:53.084 --> 00:28:54.326]  No, he's very dangerous.
[00:28:54.366 --> 00:28:55.066]  There's no doubt about it.
[00:28:56.327 --> 00:29:01.892]  So continue with your problem with the Tea Party leadership and what type of revolution you're talking about.
[00:29:02.613 --> 00:29:13.583]  Well, going to the Tea Party, the revolution aspect of the question first, I think that I've called for boycotts for the last year and we've been somewhat effective.
[00:29:13.683 --> 00:29:15.545]  I mean, I've called for the Great Nine boycott.
[00:29:16.304 --> 00:29:32.087]  Of several major fast food places, all the auto industries, all three of them, Pepsi and Coca-Cola, simply to send a message to corporate America that we're out here, we've got power, we can write your checks, or we can cancel them.
[00:29:33.467 --> 00:29:41.489]  I've also called for a one-day work stoppage, which we've not yet instituted, we've not made it effective as of yet.
[00:29:42.228 --> 00:29:44.992]  But to have America stop working for one day.
[00:29:45.052 --> 00:29:55.107]  Now, the Tea Party people, Dick Armey, I think, floated that idea a couple of months ago and I called him out on it because I had called for it going back four or five months ago.
[00:29:56.169 --> 00:30:04.994]  That America should shut down for one day completely to let the powers that be know that we're here and we're not going to be marginalized.
[00:30:05.015 --> 00:30:07.136]  We're not going to be constitutionally castrated.
[00:30:07.156 --> 00:30:08.677]  We're not going to have that happen.
[00:30:09.137 --> 00:30:14.941]  And if they don't respond in the one-day work stoppage, then we'll go for a four-week work stoppage.
[00:30:15.281 --> 00:30:23.506]  But, of course, you know, Alex, once you do a one-day work stoppage, those that are involved in the process will most probably be either arrested
[00:30:24.206 --> 00:30:34.430]  And if you go for a one-week work stoppage, the Obama machine will call out the military to try to put down that one-day work stoppage.
[00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:35.830]  It will not happen in a vacuum.
[00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:37.351]  It will not happen in a peaceful way.
[00:30:38.151 --> 00:30:40.712]  And I'm not one to advocate shedding blood.
[00:30:40.732 --> 00:30:44.473]  That's not something that I want people to think of me first of.
[00:30:44.793 --> 00:30:49.175]  However, that's beginning to float around, and I would like to repeal that as much as possible.
[00:30:49.715 --> 00:30:53.316]  But I'm convinced that one of the more powerful ways of boycotting
[00:30:54.233 --> 00:31:05.241]  This structure, the corporate, this new corporate Supreme Court law that gives corporations the opportunity to buy candidates, to buy elections, that's exactly what happened last week.
[00:31:05.941 --> 00:31:10.725]  And you've got to stop the corporations through the power of a one-week work stoppage.
[00:31:11.765 --> 00:31:13.967]  It will turn violent should that happen.
[00:31:14.312 --> 00:31:18.875]  Well, what they did is they said, oh, you can't have a Hillary film, which is clearly unconstitutional.
[00:31:19.155 --> 00:31:28.661]  So they expanded it using a ruling that was good to just say unlimited giving, foreign companies, foreign corporations can come in and take over even further.
[00:31:28.961 --> 00:31:31.723]  But there's still the restrictions on what individuals can give.
[00:31:32.423 --> 00:31:32.944]  Absolutely.
[00:31:33.164 --> 00:31:36.186]  So it's actually unfair for the corporations.
[00:31:36.206 --> 00:31:36.506]  Stay there.
[00:31:36.546 --> 00:31:38.147]  Let's talk more about that on the other side.
[00:31:38.968 --> 00:31:40.549]  But again, that's the system panicking.
[00:31:41.394 --> 00:31:48.947]  Pulling out all the stops to try to pile on more money, to shut us down, to shut us up.
[00:31:48.988 --> 00:31:52.634]  But the people are only going to wake up that much faster because things are falling apart.
[00:31:52.814 --> 00:31:54.097]  They can't paper over that.
[00:31:54.117 --> 00:31:54.557]  Stay with us.
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:03.622]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:03.942 --> 00:32:12.067]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:32:12.808 --> 00:32:16.850]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:28.197]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:32:28.817 --> 00:32:37.826]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:38.326 --> 00:32:43.371]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:32:43.771 --> 00:32:50.958]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:51.258 --> 00:32:54.001]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:32:59.102 --> 00:33:02.726]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:33:02.746 --> 00:33:06.130]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:11.135]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:33:11.155 --> 00:33:17.402]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:33:17.562 --> 00:33:19.805]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:33:20.325 --> 00:33:20.605]  Tim Geithner?
[00:33:20.625 --> 00:33:21.046]  Bernanke?
[00:33:21.146 --> 00:33:21.906]  They're arsonists!
[00:33:21.946 --> 00:33:23.067]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:33:23.087 --> 00:33:25.328]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:33:39.218 --> 00:33:43.143]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:33:43.604 --> 00:33:46.107]  we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:33:46.427 --> 00:33:55.558]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:33:57.697 --> 00:34:02.964]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[00:34:03.024 --> 00:34:05.768]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:34:05.788 --> 00:34:10.234]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:34:12.517 --> 00:34:15.558]  Order Shadow Government from InfoWars.com.
[00:34:15.578 --> 00:34:16.658]  We also have some specials.

[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:31.582]  It exposes how a cashless society, surveillance beast grid of total control is being put into place.
[00:34:31.603 --> 00:34:33.303]  This film needs to be seen.
[00:34:33.583 --> 00:34:34.503]  Everybody needs to get it.

[00:34:45.539 --> 00:34:46.279]  Shadow Government.

[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:55.943]  Available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:34:59.485 --> 00:35:05.527]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:35:06.128 --> 00:35:09.089]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:28.718]  The Supreme Court removed limits on corporate labor donations to campaigns, but the way I read this ruling, they did not remove the $3,000 limit on citizens.
[00:35:29.959 --> 00:35:35.603]  So we, as human beings, don't get to give more, because that's what really threatens them.
[00:35:36.584 --> 00:35:44.731]  But offshore corporations, I mean, that's treason right there, and many people have written editorial articles saying that is treason by the Supreme Court, but
[00:35:46.511 --> 00:35:50.996]  I remember criticizing them saying they couldn't have a Hillary film that was funded by a corporation.
[00:35:51.036 --> 00:35:55.801]  That's one thing, but to say unlimited, offshore, campaign, openly?
[00:35:57.783 --> 00:35:58.224]  I tell you...
[00:35:59.767 --> 00:36:00.367]  It's amazing.
[00:36:00.627 --> 00:36:01.928]  It's amazing, Reverend Manning.
[00:36:02.268 --> 00:36:08.650]  Well, essentially what that ruling says, Alex, is that only corporations will be able to vote.
[00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:10.831]  Corporations and their surrogates.
[00:36:10.991 --> 00:36:17.734]  That if you belong to a corporation and you are part of the shareholders of that corporation, then you can vote.
[00:36:18.134 --> 00:36:20.615]  But if you are an individual citizen,
[00:36:21.255 --> 00:36:22.595]  Where do you see this going?
[00:36:45.879 --> 00:37:07.814]  I see this—I believe that the Obama administration, the world government powers that exist and that have existed, believe that global power is more possible now than ever, that they can unify this planet, if you will.
[00:37:07.954 --> 00:37:10.176]  They can make it a prison planet, if you must.
[00:37:11.099 --> 00:37:15.441]  And that there's really no one or nothing that can stop them right now.
[00:37:15.541 --> 00:37:17.803]  They don't see anything out there that can stop them.
[00:37:18.623 --> 00:37:30.309]  The only thing that they're trying to avoid right now, though, I do believe that martial law would be a great way in which, well, if there was an uprising or revolt or revolution,
[00:37:31.354 --> 00:37:33.096]  That was not well planned.
[00:37:48.328 --> 00:37:56.014]  They're just trying to avoid people coming out with the 250 million guns that are in the homes of America to overthrow this movement.
[00:37:56.074 --> 00:38:00.717]  But they believe right now they're in control and there's absolutely nothing that can be done.
[00:38:01.158 --> 00:38:07.582]  Nothing that can stop this global takeover and the amassing of global power into the hands of just a few people.
[00:38:08.723 --> 00:38:15.268]  They really do think America and the world is done and this is a scientific dictatorship.
[00:38:15.448 --> 00:38:16.469]  It's really happening.
[00:38:17.534 --> 00:38:18.575]  I don't think so.
[00:38:35.171 --> 00:38:49.457]  And I think that's happening not just because the public's awake and angry and active, Reverend Manning, but because police, military, bureaucrats, people who are in there seeing this, they're quietly not going along with it.
[00:38:49.497 --> 00:38:50.818]  They're leaking information.
[00:38:50.858 --> 00:38:51.839]  They're saying no.
[00:38:53.099 --> 00:38:58.181]  And I mean, I think we're in very, very dark times, but at the same time,
[00:39:01.488 --> 00:39:16.203]  Well, you know, I think what you just—I'm very much aware of what you stated, how clear that is, that people within the military, within the police, within the—and within the structure of the government recognize what is happening.
[00:39:16.443 --> 00:39:18.185]  They have not been made a part of it.
[00:39:18.425 --> 00:39:20.047]  They will not be made a part of it.
[00:39:20.886 --> 00:39:25.310]  And for those reasons, a part of the process could be slowing down.
[00:39:26.811 --> 00:39:33.317]  I at one time thought that perhaps they may have lost interest in using Obama as a front man.
[00:39:33.337 --> 00:39:39.683]  The Copenhagen failure caused me to think a little bit, but I didn't have any conclusive evidence.
[00:39:40.282 --> 00:39:45.545]  That perhaps they thought that they would slow down on him and perhaps pick another person to be the leader of this group.
[00:39:45.945 --> 00:40:01.174]  But the other thing is that, you know, I'm not sure that the American people understand—well, what I would say is that perhaps what you're discussing right now we probably ought not to discuss.
[00:40:02.893 --> 00:40:14.180]  Because there are a large number of people within the military who have been made aware of all of the conspiracies that are happening and this global takeover and we might be putting them in jeopardy at some point.
[00:40:14.601 --> 00:40:15.481]  Well that's just it.
[00:40:15.501 --> 00:40:17.783]  I mean, that's just it.
[00:40:18.383 --> 00:40:23.487]  If you expose the program, which we've done with the alternative media, which is why they want to shut down and curtail the web,
[00:40:24.227 --> 00:40:24.927]  And free speech.
[00:40:25.828 --> 00:40:32.030]  If you expose them and we're telling the truth, even if people don't wake up now, as it unfolds, they will wake up.
[00:40:32.831 --> 00:40:34.632]  Because it's almost like prophecy.
[00:40:34.912 --> 00:40:40.014]  We have their game plan, and you lay it out beforehand, and then it happens as we say.
[00:40:40.794 --> 00:40:42.175]  That really gets people's attention.
[00:40:42.195 --> 00:40:49.378]  And I think that's what myself and many others, and you, over the decades, getting the truth out, is devastating to them.
[00:40:49.398 --> 00:40:50.979]  Because I say it every day because it's so true.
[00:40:52.296 --> 00:40:55.097]  Lies have to be reapplied constantly.
[00:40:56.578 --> 00:40:58.199]  Constantly have to be reapplied.
[00:40:58.679 --> 00:40:59.499]  Over and over again.
[00:40:59.539 --> 00:41:02.861]  But the truth just burns through the lies.
[00:41:03.461 --> 00:41:05.102]  And so we've only got to wake somebody up.
[00:41:05.122 --> 00:41:06.763]  We've only got to show them how they've been lied to.
[00:41:07.935 --> 00:41:10.276]  And then they've opened their eyes to the larger fraud.
[00:41:11.437 --> 00:41:30.889]  Well, you know, where we're standing, if you look at what's happening in Europe and how Europe is being co-opted, and how they've lost all their sense of democracy and freedom of speech, and the last bastion, of course, here in America,
[00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:35.234]  We were indeed the ideal.
[00:41:35.294 --> 00:41:46.507]  We were the city on a hill, if you will, in terms of democracy, freedom of speech, and the best kind of government and patriots of people interaction.
[00:41:47.307 --> 00:41:49.667]  That has all been curtailed now.
[00:41:50.448 --> 00:41:59.249]  The problem is that we've got a large number of people in America who actually believe that it should have been curtailed, and they voted for it in this recent election with Obama.
[00:41:59.809 --> 00:42:11.471]  And as you made mention of the fellow Dice, I think was his name, in the earlier segment, that Californians are actually voting or believing that freedom of speech should be curtailed to some degree.
[00:42:12.531 --> 00:42:16.572]  What has happened is that there has been such a mind-washing
[00:42:17.521 --> 00:42:21.364]  People have nothing, so they're an empty vessel to be filled.
[00:42:21.424 --> 00:42:23.545]  Let's go to some phone calls before we run out of time here.
[00:42:23.565 --> 00:42:25.767]  You've been gracious to spend this time with us.
[00:42:25.847 --> 00:42:28.669]  Pat in Ohio, you're on the air with Dr. Manning.
[00:42:28.769 --> 00:42:29.149]  Go ahead.
[00:42:47.526 --> 00:42:50.227]  Hi, Alex and Reverend Manny.
[00:42:50.567 --> 00:42:50.847]  Hello.
[00:42:52.667 --> 00:42:56.188]  I agree with a lot of what you're saying about President Bush.
[00:42:56.788 --> 00:42:57.548]  I mean, Obama.
[00:42:58.369 --> 00:42:58.949]  Same person.
[00:43:00.469 --> 00:43:01.209]  Yeah, it is.
[00:43:01.629 --> 00:43:11.012]  But I think you've been a little too harsh when you say that when you call for the execution of him, if he's found guilty of lying about his birth certificate.
[00:43:12.052 --> 00:43:14.893]  Sure, he should go to jail or whatever, but to be executed?
[00:43:14.913 --> 00:43:16.433]  No, even though it may be a law.
[00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:18.381]  I think that's a little too harsh.
[00:43:18.821 --> 00:43:21.563]  If anybody needs to be executed, it should be President Bush.
[00:43:21.623 --> 00:43:23.584]  I mean, considering what he did on 9-11.
[00:43:23.884 --> 00:43:25.965]  He was involved in the 9-11 event.
[00:43:26.286 --> 00:43:29.247]  Him and Vice President Cheney.
[00:43:29.628 --> 00:43:33.910]  Well, I'm not going to sit here and call for that.
[00:43:33.970 --> 00:43:40.774]  I don't want anything to happen to those guys because they're high-level puppets and that'll turn the whole system into a victim when it's the victimizer.
[00:43:41.175 --> 00:43:42.696]  But, Pat, I appreciate your call.
[00:43:42.716 --> 00:43:44.777]  Let me get a comment from Dr. Manning on that.
[00:43:45.506 --> 00:43:52.010]  Well, if the question is about capital punishment, that you would be adverse to that, then I can certainly appreciate it.
[00:43:52.930 --> 00:44:10.701]  But if it's simply about the severity of the crime, I think that the issue of the birth certificate may be the doorway, but the severity of the crime, what the illegal status has done, and the number of people that have been injured as a result of him coming to power in an illegal way,
[00:44:11.161 --> 00:44:25.932]  Might be a way you would want to consider that, because if he's created great injury and been able to launch more wars and create more deaths, then you may think and may reconsider and say, well, it might be worth execution at that point.
[00:44:26.232 --> 00:44:34.158]  And then the other thing is that founding fathers established that so that people would understand that fidelity to this nation is absolutely critical.
[00:44:34.398 --> 00:44:38.421]  Do not betray this nation under any circumstance, or your life is at risk.
[00:44:39.704 --> 00:44:41.265]  Let's talk to Julio in Illinois.
[00:44:41.325 --> 00:44:42.406]  Julio, welcome.
[00:44:43.287 --> 00:44:45.469]  Alex Jones, Dr. Manning, Freedom Fighters.
[00:44:45.509 --> 00:44:46.950]  How are you this afternoon, gentlemen?
[00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:48.071]  Good to talk to you.
[00:44:48.691 --> 00:44:50.653]  Good to talk to you.
[00:44:50.753 --> 00:44:52.254]  I praise you for what you're doing right now.
[00:44:52.354 --> 00:44:53.655]  Quick comment then to my question.
[00:44:54.036 --> 00:44:55.317]  Startpage.com, everybody.
[00:44:55.337 --> 00:44:56.878]  Please read Alternative Futures for 2025.
[00:44:57.218 --> 00:45:00.181]  They have this thing called Delavish Travels.
[00:45:00.241 --> 00:45:01.341]  Pretty much a prelude.
[00:45:01.582 --> 00:45:05.605]  It was April 96, a prelude to what's going on currently in Haiti.
[00:45:06.335 --> 00:45:09.337]  My question, you guys are talking about a protest, what we need to do.
[00:45:09.818 --> 00:45:12.840]  Everyone needs to know that we need to be peaceful in these actions.
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.781]  I just got done with my sociology class.
[00:45:15.121 --> 00:45:17.743]  My professor, God bless his name, he's a Christian, I believe.
[00:45:18.103 --> 00:45:19.324]  Everything is happening for a reason.
[00:45:19.364 --> 00:45:20.625]  He talked about Dr. King.
[00:45:20.765 --> 00:45:21.866]  I re-saw his speech.
[00:45:22.186 --> 00:45:25.549]  In the beginning he talked about, he is collecting a debt.
[00:45:25.889 --> 00:45:28.831]  Talking about the Constitution and how we are granted this freedom.
[00:45:29.266 --> 00:45:31.526]  We need to have a march on Wall Street.
[00:45:31.887 --> 00:45:39.108]  Everyone knows that the criminal offshore bank known as the Federal Reserve are looting us high and dry right in front of our faces.
[00:45:39.128 --> 00:45:40.588]  Let me move on to his comments.
[00:45:40.608 --> 00:45:41.349]  We're about to go to break.
[00:45:41.809 --> 00:45:47.950]  Clearly, I believe in identifying the bankers as the real government, the real criminals, and bypassing the puppet presidents.
[00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.670]  Your take on that?
[00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:52.971]  The Bible states, the borrower is the servant of the lender.
[00:45:53.051 --> 00:45:57.172]  He who controls the money controls all of the honey.
[00:46:00.065 --> 00:46:02.327]  Well, he controls the money, controls the world, quite frankly.
[00:46:03.888 --> 00:46:05.029]  So we go after the banks?
[00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:06.831]  Absolutely.
[00:46:07.972 --> 00:46:10.634]  The Federal Reserve, I think, not so much the banks.
[00:46:11.174 --> 00:46:14.317]  They are certainly a target, no doubt about it, and a very visible one.
[00:46:14.969 --> 00:46:16.370]  I mean the mega-banking structure.
[00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:17.910]  Sure, I don't mean your Mayberry Bank.
[00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:19.011]  You should support that, yeah.
[00:46:19.371 --> 00:46:20.191]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:46:20.511 --> 00:46:20.911]  Absolutely.
[00:46:21.291 --> 00:46:32.736]  But the Federal Reserve, I think most people are unaware of how insidious the Federal Reserve is, how it was founded, what it does, and how it manipulates world governments.
[00:46:33.176 --> 00:46:39.458]  It manipulates, if you will, the growth of products and services and other nations.
[00:46:39.718 --> 00:46:41.319]  It must be exposed and dethroned.
[00:46:42.483 --> 00:46:47.785]  We're going to come back, take three quick calls in the last segment with Reverend Manning, Isaac, Tracy, and Mark.
[00:46:47.825 --> 00:46:56.108]  Stand by, everyone, right to you after this break and the final segment with our guest and a big news blitz coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:46:56.128 --> 00:46:56.628]  Stay with us.
[00:46:58.064 --> 00:47:05.567]  Aaron Aqua dot com is your one stop shop for some of the most affordable air and water purification systems available on the market today.
[00:47:05.587 --> 00:47:09.888]  Aaron Aqua dot com knows exactly what doesn't belong in our air and our water.
[00:47:10.089 --> 00:47:14.070]  And they know exactly how to help you rid your home or office of these harmful toxins.
[00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:18.932]  Did you know that your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?
[00:47:19.152 --> 00:47:22.833]  Aaron Aqua dot com can help you eliminate dangerous chlorine from your water.
[00:47:22.853 --> 00:47:27.215]  Aaron Aqua dot com carries atmospheric water generators, glass water bottles,
[00:47:27.515 --> 00:47:28.095]  We're good to go.
[00:47:59.332 --> 00:48:02.979]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:48:03.379 --> 00:48:06.365]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:48:06.605 --> 00:48:08.028]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:48:08.729 --> 00:48:11.370]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:17.592]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:48:17.772 --> 00:48:22.814]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:48:23.334 --> 00:48:32.938]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:48:33.078 --> 00:48:35.179]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:48:35.419 --> 00:48:36.759]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:48:37.019 --> 00:48:39.280]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:41.300]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:46.361]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:48:46.741 --> 00:48:51.523]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[00:48:58.624 --> 00:48:59.464]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:48:59.665 --> 00:49:04.987]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:49:05.187 --> 00:49:05.608]  I get it.
[00:49:05.728 --> 00:49:15.052]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:49:15.352 --> 00:49:16.493]  That's not what's happening.
[00:49:16.753 --> 00:49:24.999]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:49:25.239 --> 00:49:28.501]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:49:28.621 --> 00:49:32.704]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:49:32.884 --> 00:49:34.465]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:49:34.505 --> 00:49:37.727]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[00:49:38.448 --> 00:49:42.050]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:42.970]  You should too.
[00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:44.131]  Find out what they know.
[00:49:44.311 --> 00:49:47.533]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[00:49:47.553 --> 00:49:47.593]  800-686-2237.
[00:49:47.613 --> 00:49:47.893]  800-686-2237.
[00:49:47.953 --> 00:49:48.133]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:49:48.173 --> 00:49:48.333]  Hello.
[00:49:48.353 --> 00:49:50.354]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[00:49:50.614 --> 00:49:52.595]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which
[00:50:10.202 --> 00:50:12.863]  What would people like you have to say about the wild food experience?
[00:50:13.203 --> 00:50:17.144]  It's inspiring for many who are affected by the recent downturn of the economy.
[00:50:17.304 --> 00:50:21.225]  I already knew a bit about foraging and edibles, but you take it to a whole new level.
[00:50:21.345 --> 00:50:23.885]  A thousand thanks to you for all that great knowledge.
[00:50:24.145 --> 00:50:25.066]  It was empowering.
[00:50:25.166 --> 00:50:29.027]  When I was in the Navy, I went through a couple of quick land survival classes.
[00:50:29.167 --> 00:50:31.947]  Thank you for being an inspiration and for all the work that you do.
[00:50:31.987 --> 00:50:34.708]  I really appreciate the depth and detail of the information.
[00:50:34.728 --> 00:50:35.588]  Thank you so much.
[00:50:35.808 --> 00:50:38.569]  Much love and respect to you from all of us here in the boonies.
[00:50:39.409 --> 00:50:42.070]  Knowledge is power, and that power brings peace.
[00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:45.791]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[00:50:46.211 --> 00:50:49.611]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[00:50:49.792 --> 00:50:56.993]  You can order online for you and your loved ones, or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[00:51:01.014 --> 00:51:04.975]  Let's move quickly to the call's final segment with Reverend Manning.
[00:51:04.995 --> 00:51:06.696]  Let's talk to Isaac in Colorado.
[00:51:06.876 --> 00:51:07.696]  Isaac, you're on the air.
[00:51:07.736 --> 00:51:08.056]  Welcome.
[00:51:08.601 --> 00:51:25.412]  Gentlemen, I wanted to get Reverend Manning's take on the Romans chapter 13 thing with the whole FEMA clergy response team thing they're trying to push on all these... Reverend, I'm sure you're aware that covertly we got the documents four years ago, Butch Pa got them, but two years after they admitted they've secretly hired
[00:51:26.536 --> 00:51:32.383]  Tens of thousands of preachers to covertly teach Romans 13, give up your guns, go to the FEMA camp.
[00:51:32.463 --> 00:51:34.225]  We have preachers on TV admitting this.
[00:51:37.029 --> 00:51:38.571]  Is that your question in total, Isaac?
[00:51:39.284 --> 00:51:42.025]  Yeah, yeah, pretty much how he would respond to something like that.
[00:51:42.506 --> 00:51:52.791]  Well, first of all, I was not one of them, but secondly, any preacher who is paid to promote a particular gospel is no longer a preacher.
[00:51:53.691 --> 00:51:55.572]  He's no longer a servant of the Lord.
[00:51:55.952 --> 00:52:03.776]  But that understanding the government going after, asking preachers to do that, and them acquiescing to it, yes, I'm sure they've done it.
[00:52:04.316 --> 00:52:06.399]  I don't think they've been very effective, though.
[00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:09.402]  I think that's what has happened over the last few years.
[00:52:09.822 --> 00:52:17.330]  More people have applied for and gotten actual permits to purchase guns, and America is armed to the teeth right now.
[00:52:17.671 --> 00:52:19.493]  That was a failed policy, if you ask me.
[00:52:19.853 --> 00:52:23.417]  America instinctively knew day one that Obama was pure evil.
[00:52:25.316 --> 00:52:32.982]  America instinctively knew, the part of America that has a soul, instinctively knew that Obama was pure evil day one.
[00:52:33.402 --> 00:52:34.063]  Exactly.
[00:52:34.323 --> 00:52:34.844]  Exactly.
[00:52:35.604 --> 00:52:35.985]  They did.
[00:52:36.005 --> 00:52:51.657]  I mean, within their NOAA, which I say spiritually, the soul, they sensed that something was wrong, that they knew that this man was not right, and began to defend themselves and protect their homes, and to protect this nation as well.
[00:52:53.254 --> 00:52:57.337]  Yeah, the New World Order is in trouble, but it's still moving forward, and the battle is joined.
[00:52:57.377 --> 00:53:00.780]  The final big battles unfolding right now here in the United States.
[00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:05.523]  The rest of the world's... Well, I would think that the New World Order recognizes that they've got a bit of a problem.
[00:53:05.583 --> 00:53:06.864]  Somewhere or another, something happened.
[00:53:07.204 --> 00:53:13.489]  Copenhagen has caused me to think that they've got a bit of a problem, but they're in no way anywhere near defeated.
[00:53:13.549 --> 00:53:15.731]  I can tell you that now, and anyone who thinks that they are... Yes.
[00:53:16.611 --> 00:53:23.036]  We've had some victories, we've wounded the dragon, but we've shown he's not invincible, but he's certainly not that hurt.
[00:53:23.676 --> 00:53:24.697]  Appreciate the call, Isaac.
[00:53:24.757 --> 00:53:26.418]  Tracy in New Mexico, you're on the air.
[00:53:27.879 --> 00:53:31.982]  Hey Alex, Doctor, nice to get on.
[00:53:32.502 --> 00:53:45.551]  Alex, you said it perfectly, that the American people, the ones that have souls and know right from wrong, knew from the very beginning that this guy was the worst sort of bad news that we could possibly have thrust on us.
[00:53:46.770 --> 00:53:53.076]  And now we find ourselves, I think the last thing you said, it may be slowed down, but it's still moving forward.
[00:53:53.216 --> 00:53:55.057]  I hate that saying.
[00:53:57.339 --> 00:54:02.964]  So at this point, do we continue to do everything that we've already done?
[00:54:02.984 --> 00:54:04.545]  We know it's not going to work?
[00:54:05.326 --> 00:54:10.290]  Or do we organize something that is a little bit out of the box?
[00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:16.506]  At least has more of a chance of working because... Well, I mean, let me be clear.
[00:54:16.586 --> 00:54:17.327]  It is working.
[00:54:17.367 --> 00:54:18.849]  They're failing on every front.
[00:54:19.169 --> 00:54:22.554]  The problem is they've got the power, and so they just keep going.
[00:54:22.914 --> 00:54:27.220]  But more and more of the punches they throw are failing, and...
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:30.861]  The answer is sunlight.
[00:54:30.921 --> 00:54:32.281]  The answer is an awakening.
[00:54:32.401 --> 00:54:45.426]  Going to every hill and mountain, every valley, and letting the people know that the enemy had net the gates, it's in the gates, and this is real, and the Republican Tea Party-oid takeover isn't going to save us.
[00:54:46.306 --> 00:54:47.787]  But again, it's a manifestation.
[00:54:48.107 --> 00:54:53.489]  Just like the Brown being elected in Massachusetts isn't a total victory, but it's a message
[00:54:54.329 --> 00:54:56.111]  Just like the purchasing of guns is a message.
[00:54:56.611 --> 00:54:56.891]  I don't know.
[00:54:56.951 --> 00:54:59.634]  I feel in my gut we're really, really having victories.
[00:55:00.054 --> 00:55:00.615]  Reverend Manning?
[00:55:01.425 --> 00:55:08.231]  I'm convinced we're having victories, and not only that, I'm convinced that we're winning battles, and I'm convinced that we're going to ultimately win the war.
[00:55:08.351 --> 00:55:09.432]  I'm confident of that.
[00:55:10.373 --> 00:55:13.115]  I will give my word to anyone who thinks it's worth anything.
[00:55:13.515 --> 00:55:14.936]  We will win this war.
[00:55:15.377 --> 00:55:24.925]  And to put it philosophically, I mean, I could go over the strategies that you outline so well every day, Alex, but let me just put it in the context of what you said about 20 minutes ago.
[00:55:25.825 --> 00:55:28.887]  You said that lies have to be applied every day.
[00:55:28.987 --> 00:55:36.430]  They have to get up every day and find new strategies or the strength to apply a lie while the truth is constant.
[00:55:36.930 --> 00:55:38.611]  And that's the thing that's on our side.
[00:55:38.671 --> 00:55:40.872]  That is the paradigm of the battles.
[00:55:41.452 --> 00:55:43.173]  We're out of time for calls.
[00:55:43.313 --> 00:55:47.376]  I'll continue with your calls coming up after I cover some more news.
[00:55:47.416 --> 00:55:48.877]  But I do appreciate your spirit.
[00:55:48.897 --> 00:55:50.698]  I appreciate... I can feel your courage.
[00:55:50.718 --> 00:55:51.299]  My discernment.
[00:56:10.393 --> 00:56:19.278]  Tells me, you know, that we need to protect you, Pastor Manning, and that you understand that you have to step up with the courage of what you're doing.
[00:56:20.499 --> 00:56:25.542]  And we will be praying for you, my friend, and I appreciate you coming on with us.
[00:56:25.922 --> 00:56:27.683]  Otla.org is the website.
[00:56:28.044 --> 00:56:28.604]  God bless you.
[00:56:28.964 --> 00:56:30.625]  God bless you, and I will rest in that, Alex.
[00:56:30.645 --> 00:56:32.246]  Thank you so very much for those very kind words.
[00:56:32.426 --> 00:56:32.687]  Thank you.
[00:56:32.707 --> 00:56:33.767]  We'll talk off-air soon.
[00:56:33.807 --> 00:56:34.728]  I'll call you in the next few days.
[00:56:35.984 --> 00:56:36.565]  Thank you, Pastor.
[00:56:37.165 --> 00:56:39.248]  We'll be back with the big news blitz of information.
[00:56:40.209 --> 00:56:42.091]  These are the times that try men's souls.
[00:56:42.952 --> 00:56:45.334]  Make no mistake, we're living in history right now.
[00:56:48.317 --> 00:56:49.258]  We're on the march.
[00:56:49.719 --> 00:56:51.321]  The empire's on the run.
[00:56:52.242 --> 00:56:54.945]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:58.206 --> 00:57:00.807]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:57:01.208 --> 00:57:06.170]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:57:06.550 --> 00:57:08.271]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:57:08.591 --> 00:57:13.414]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:57:13.594 --> 00:57:14.554]  How much do you want?
[00:57:14.774 --> 00:57:15.515]  When do you want it?
[00:57:15.895 --> 00:57:17.496]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:57:17.796 --> 00:57:18.596]  When will you need it?
[00:57:18.856 --> 00:57:20.917]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:57:21.058 --> 00:57:22.158]  Will there be any food?
[00:57:22.398 --> 00:57:23.699]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:57:24.019 --> 00:57:28.983]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:57:29.184 --> 00:57:32.367]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:57:32.767 --> 00:57:36.270]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:57:36.590 --> 00:57:37.571]  How much will you need?
[00:57:37.831 --> 00:57:38.432]  We don't know.
[00:57:38.712 --> 00:57:39.633]  How much do you want?
[00:57:39.833 --> 00:57:40.574]  All you can get.
[00:57:40.754 --> 00:57:41.555]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:57:41.835 --> 00:57:44.598]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:57:44.899 --> 00:57:46.641]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:57:46.661 --> 00:57:47.582]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:57:57.455 --> 00:57:58.455]  What's your home worth?
[00:57:58.615 --> 00:58:00.556]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[00:58:00.736 --> 00:58:03.477]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[00:58:03.777 --> 00:58:11.299]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.
[00:58:11.479 --> 00:58:14.920]  HomeGain.com will help you find a realtor to buy or sell a home.

[00:58:56.909 --> 00:59:00.891]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:59:01.011 --> 00:59:03.753]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:59:03.873 --> 00:59:05.134]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:59:05.154 --> 00:59:05.834]  It's very real.
[00:59:05.974 --> 00:59:08.095]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:59:08.216 --> 00:59:09.736]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:59:09.877 --> 00:59:14.199]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[00:59:44.692 --> 00:59:46.373]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:00:21.927 --> 01:00:27.149]  You know, I watched my film, Fall of the Republic.
[01:00:27.269 --> 01:00:39.415]  I watched my film, The Obama Deception, and I'm just so proud to have made these documentary films and so honored to have this amazing team here in the office that worked with me and made this possible.
[01:00:42.116 --> 01:00:46.818]  If every American would sit down and watch Fall of the Republic, we would defeat the New World Order.
[01:00:47.118 --> 01:00:48.519]  There's no doubt that would wake up
[01:00:49.784 --> 01:00:56.669]  Sixty, seventy percent of the people that saw it, conservatively, and they would understand the entire game plan, and it'd be over for the New World Order.
[01:00:59.171 --> 01:01:12.861]  If the public had any idea of the peril they're in, and how they've been robbed, and what's going on, and where this is leading and going, I know you as an audience know this, and I go to you time and time again, and I say, carry the truth to the people.
[01:01:12.981 --> 01:01:13.502]  Educate them.
[01:01:13.522 --> 01:01:19.066]  That's why you can download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv in high quality, make discs,
[01:01:20.362 --> 01:01:24.148]  Most DVD players sold the last four or five years play DivX.
[01:01:24.288 --> 01:01:27.733]  We have a DivX download that's really good quality, almost as good as regular DVD.
[01:01:28.053 --> 01:01:35.084]  It burns to regular cheap 20-cent CDs that'll play on most DVD players and all computers, all modern computers.
[01:01:36.462 --> 01:01:41.165]  We have all the other different downloads at PrisonPlanet.tv, the shows in higher quality.
[01:01:41.645 --> 01:01:57.774]  We advertise and link to the films free on Infowars.com to the great folks that have posted on their channels at YouTube, like ChangeTheChannel, in pretty good quality.
[01:01:59.055 --> 01:02:00.316]  Is that Pearls Before Swine?
[01:02:00.336 --> 01:02:00.976]  I don't think it is.
[01:02:02.992 --> 01:02:10.217]  I don't think 5 million views, though, on that one channel for Obama Deception and a million and a half or whatever it is for Fall of the Republic.
[01:02:10.237 --> 01:02:19.262]  I mean, there's hundreds of other channels and streams and BitTorrents and conservatively, Obama Deception's been seen by, I'd say, 40 million people.
[01:02:19.302 --> 01:02:22.384]  This has been seen by 4 or 5 million, Fall of the Republic.
[01:02:22.765 --> 01:02:25.106]  There's no way to gauge what people have done on the street.
[01:02:25.766 --> 01:02:27.347]  The great folks at Freedom's Phoenix
[01:02:29.019 --> 01:02:35.984]  Out in Arizona, gave out over 30,000 copies at the university and in the town.
[01:02:36.144 --> 01:02:38.926]  I mean, on record, gave out 30,000 copies.
[01:02:39.346 --> 01:02:40.526]  I mean, that is aggressive.
[01:02:40.567 --> 01:02:41.467]  That is powerful.
[01:02:41.707 --> 01:02:44.329]  That's the spirit that could save this country.
[01:02:46.410 --> 01:02:57.197]  And everything we've talked about, everything we've exposed, in hindsight, has been proven right.
[01:02:58.337 --> 01:02:59.238]  And we are real.
[01:02:59.939 --> 01:03:01.320]  And that's why the New World Order hates us.
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:03.422]  They hate Fall of the Republic.
[01:03:03.462 --> 01:03:05.303]  They hate the Obama deception.
[01:03:05.464 --> 01:03:06.504]  They hate Endgame.
[01:03:07.045 --> 01:03:08.406]  Because it is veritas.
[01:03:08.506 --> 01:03:09.167]  It is truth.
[01:03:09.527 --> 01:03:16.774]  It shatters the left-right control bridle, the governor system that controls people's minds and limits their thought processes.
[01:03:16.854 --> 01:03:19.256]  It shatters the fake environmental movement.
[01:03:20.037 --> 01:03:23.500]  It shatters the federalization of police and Northcom.
[01:03:25.973 --> 01:03:32.639]  And I just wish I could somehow sit down and talk to every American and reach out to them.
[01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:36.442]  They've been brought up in tyranny incrementally.
[01:03:37.002 --> 01:03:40.565]  They psychologically are too afraid to admit the full magnitude of it.
[01:03:41.045 --> 01:03:44.208]  It's hard for me to admit it to myself consciously.
[01:03:45.369 --> 01:03:46.130]  That's why a lot of times
[01:03:47.754 --> 01:03:53.538]  I wake up almost every night at like 3.30 in the morning now, just laying there in the bed going, my God, this is so real.
[01:03:53.578 --> 01:03:54.379]  This is so big.
[01:03:54.419 --> 01:03:55.240]  This is so evil.
[01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:57.461]  And I am not perfect.
[01:03:57.922 --> 01:03:59.163]  I don't have all the answers.
[01:03:59.643 --> 01:04:00.303]  I get angry.
[01:04:00.464 --> 01:04:01.224]  I get primitive.
[01:04:02.265 --> 01:04:04.687]  I get very aggressive and I try to govern it.
[01:04:08.149 --> 01:04:14.274]  It's almost like I want to stop jogging every morning because it just gets me more and more angry and more and more aggressive, the testosterone.
[01:04:15.885 --> 01:04:33.646]  Because as a natural man, a red-blooded man, when people are doing these type of bad things, it just creates not even rage or anger, just more than fury, just like mechanized will to grapple with these people.
[01:04:41.488 --> 01:04:43.209]  I never said I was the man for the job.
[01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:44.789]  I'm in way over my head.
[01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:46.130]  But so are you.
[01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:58.335]  We were all in over our head up against an elite who studied how humans operate and are using psychology, sociology, anthropology, marketing, drugging the population, both overtly and covertly.
[01:04:58.695 --> 01:05:00.635]  And it's so real and it's so big.
[01:05:09.315 --> 01:05:25.127]  To see the average person reduced by Madison Avenue to feeling insecure about themselves, and to see the average person reduced and dehumanized and just turned into mindless vessels of dehumanization.
[01:05:29.250 --> 01:05:32.032]  And to know there's so many other wonderful, good people.
[01:05:32.472 --> 01:05:38.177]  I mean, I almost started crying last night when I was at that
[01:05:39.352 --> 01:05:40.112]  Demonstration.
[01:05:41.873 --> 01:05:46.414]  And I saw these families bringing their children up to me for me to shake their hand.
[01:05:46.474 --> 01:05:47.754]  I just look at their innocence.
[01:05:50.235 --> 01:05:56.496]  And I think about everything that our society has gone through, everything it's going through, everything it's going to go through.
[01:05:56.516 --> 01:06:05.238]  And I think about all the children the New World Order is killing, cutting off their food and water and power supplies and stopping development.
[01:06:09.378 --> 01:06:15.201]  And it blasted me.
[01:06:15.361 --> 01:06:34.532]  I am like blasted by like the winds of tyranny and it's really made me stronger in a way as so much of my worldliness that we all have in the system has been just peeled away and torn back but I'm still this primitive
[01:06:35.709 --> 01:06:43.513]  Weak creature, but at the same time, I have all these human attributes, all the good things that are in humanity, that paradox.
[01:06:45.114 --> 01:06:55.120]  And the more I learn about how people work, the more I understand about myself and others, that we just would have had more time, more time to recognize this earlier.
[01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:59.242]  If we had listened to those 50, 60 years ago that warned us, God, it's horrible.
[01:07:01.874 --> 01:07:03.776]  People think perception is reality.
[01:07:03.816 --> 01:07:07.279]  They think what they buy into is what is the truth.
[01:07:07.379 --> 01:07:12.243]  And I've learned in my life to really try to search out what the real truth is.
[01:07:13.804 --> 01:07:16.447]  And I just realized that we are a culture of lies.
[01:07:21.111 --> 01:07:24.714]  A culture of people that have bought into so many lies and so many distortions.
[01:07:26.275 --> 01:07:28.259]  And that's the offer of the New World Order.
[01:07:28.319 --> 01:07:31.664]  We'll drug you up, we'll give you entertainment, we'll euthanize you slowly.
[01:07:32.858 --> 01:07:43.760]  You know, it's the comfortable, easy way to go versus trying to be an individual in this high-tech grid and trying to figure it out, something I do around the clock.
[01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:45.841]  I dream about this stuff.
[01:07:45.881 --> 01:07:47.201]  I wake up thinking about it.
[01:07:47.361 --> 01:07:56.363]  I constantly have epiphanies and incredibly advanced understandings, and then later I read white papers written by top globalists
[01:07:56.883 --> 01:08:03.969]  That are as if it was written by me, but with the evil twist of that they're just openly stating it and saying it's good.
[01:08:04.589 --> 01:08:08.152]  And then to be verified, to be, to know I'm right.
[01:08:09.313 --> 01:08:12.035]  You know, I don't, I wish it wasn't true.
[01:08:12.075 --> 01:08:15.998]  So I know that human weakness of like just denial.
[01:08:16.298 --> 01:08:17.920]  No, it can't be.
[01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:19.581]  It couldn't be.
[01:08:34.403 --> 01:08:47.835]  The New World Order is here to devolve and to rip apart and to trample and to stampede humanity.
[01:08:50.197 --> 01:09:01.867]  It is a panoptagon system to turn the world into a control freak, sadistic, psychopathic paradise.
[01:09:03.894 --> 01:09:05.275]  A paradise of evil.
[01:09:05.795 --> 01:09:08.936]  A paradise of blood and torture and pain and humiliation.
[01:09:09.356 --> 01:09:18.981]  In fact, guys, Google for me, search engine for me, 1984 and the term trampling and being trampled on.
[01:09:19.021 --> 01:09:20.841]  I want that full O'Brien quote.
[01:09:21.542 --> 01:09:31.066]  When he finally breaks Winston, and that's their religion, and he leans over Winston, when Winston now believes 2 plus 2 equals 5,
[01:09:32.930 --> 01:09:35.392]  Because freedom is the ability to say 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[01:09:35.452 --> 01:09:37.153]  That really is freedom.
[01:09:39.595 --> 01:09:43.537]  And he leans over and he says, now you see, Winston, we are the priest of power.
[01:09:43.678 --> 01:09:46.119]  Always pressing on the nerve of power.
[01:09:48.181 --> 01:09:56.967]  You know, you look at my body, the torturer says, the inner party member as he leans over Winston, a little newspaper propagandist from the Ministry of Truth,
[01:09:59.141 --> 01:10:20.809]  And he says, you look at the lines in my face and the blood vessels in my eyes and how I look like the life is going out of me, but that's the vigor of the overall species, the psychopathic uber-species that's going to just tear down humanity, stomp on humanity, annihilate
[01:10:22.130 --> 01:10:25.851]  Humanity just driving over it, stomping on the human face forever.
[01:10:26.252 --> 01:10:29.313]  And Orwell had been a secret policeman in India.
[01:10:29.893 --> 01:10:32.314]  He'd fought for the communists, found out that was all rigged.
[01:10:32.354 --> 01:10:35.135]  He'd been a top propagandist at BBC during the war.
[01:10:37.779 --> 01:10:42.463]  And I've read just so many of his essays and letters where he was talking about this is the real world.
[01:10:42.523 --> 01:10:43.544]  This is what they're building.
[01:10:44.285 --> 01:10:48.368]  But Huxley came along before he died and gave that Berkeley speech and admitted it's all real.
[01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:50.690]  The UN plans to drug you, dumb you down.
[01:10:51.011 --> 01:10:53.873]  My brother, you know, runs a lot of it at UNESCO.
[01:10:56.115 --> 01:10:56.796]  Julian Huxley.
[01:10:58.180 --> 01:10:59.461]  And Orwell had it wrong.
[01:11:00.382 --> 01:11:11.091]  It's going to be a Trudgeon, black ski mask, boot on the face, but with an overlay of glitz and glamour and entertainment and drugs and drugging and genetic engineering.
[01:11:11.212 --> 01:11:13.393]  And I mean, he wrote that in 33.
[01:11:13.714 --> 01:11:16.276]  Do you know how far past us these people are?
[01:11:16.296 --> 01:11:16.276]  1933.
[01:11:17.437 --> 01:11:25.104]  I can't read Brave New World or Brave New World Revisited, which is a nonfiction.
[01:11:27.250 --> 01:11:30.972]  Because I see everything they're doing to us and it's a joke.
[01:11:31.052 --> 01:11:41.319]  It's a sick joke for them to crouch on us and to sit on our chest and to beat on us and to just throw it in our face.
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:45.661]  Put that Orwell clip back up for me, please.
[01:11:46.402 --> 01:11:47.282]  I want to read that on air.
[01:11:48.843 --> 01:11:55.227]  I saw that you did successfully pull it up there for a moment, Matt Ryan.
[01:11:58.439 --> 01:12:01.441]  Alright, this is O'Brien while he is torturing him.
[01:12:01.721 --> 01:12:02.662]  Oh, Jaren, you have it printed out?
[01:12:03.523 --> 01:12:04.043]  Bring it on in.
[01:12:05.364 --> 01:12:05.905]  Thank you, brother.
[01:12:09.507 --> 01:12:12.629]  This is O'Brien when he's finally broken Winston.
[01:12:13.130 --> 01:12:15.251]  And Winston loves Big Brother and is ready to be killed.
[01:12:16.452 --> 01:12:17.433]  They want you to thank them.
[01:12:17.713 --> 01:12:18.934]  They want you to love torture.
[01:12:18.974 --> 01:12:21.256]  They want you to love dehumanization, think that's good.
[01:12:22.096 --> 01:12:25.459]  All the movies and video games of the violence and where the evil guys are
[01:12:27.364 --> 01:12:28.505]  Vaunted and supported?
[01:12:29.546 --> 01:12:30.086]  Exactly!
[01:12:30.487 --> 01:12:33.389]  By making him suffer, obedience is not enough.
[01:12:33.769 --> 01:12:38.213]  Unless he is suffering, how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his own?
[01:12:38.653 --> 01:12:40.855]  Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation.
[01:12:41.256 --> 01:12:47.221]  Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing.
[01:12:48.041 --> 01:12:53.446]  You begin to see, then, what kind of world we are creating.
[01:12:54.983 --> 01:13:00.647]  It is the exact opposite of the stupid, hedonistic utopia that the old reformers imagined.
[01:13:01.708 --> 01:13:06.932]  A world of fear and treachery is torment.
[01:13:07.232 --> 01:13:10.194]  A world of trampling and being trampled upon.
[01:13:10.274 --> 01:13:15.678]  A world which will grow not less but more merciless as it refines itself.
[01:13:16.619 --> 01:13:21.002]  Progress in our world will be progress towards more pain.
[01:13:22.315 --> 01:13:25.536]  The old civilizations claim that they were founded on love and justice.
[01:13:26.276 --> 01:13:28.556]  Ours is founded upon hatred.
[01:13:30.197 --> 01:13:31.377]  And look at the controlled left.
[01:13:31.437 --> 01:13:33.398]  All they do is poverty pimp, inject race.
[01:13:33.438 --> 01:13:36.038]  Say, if you don't like big government, you're a racist.
[01:13:36.438 --> 01:13:44.120]  The very people that always claim to the liberals are the real dark-hearted eugenicists that just love exterminating the third world.
[01:13:45.791 --> 01:13:47.133]  Ours is founded upon hatred.
[01:13:47.853 --> 01:13:53.299]  In our world, there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement.
[01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:55.682]  Everything else we shall destroy.
[01:13:55.882 --> 01:13:56.263]  Everything.
[01:13:56.863 --> 01:13:59.666]  Already we are breaking down the habits of thought.
[01:14:00.509 --> 01:14:02.729]  Which have survived from before the revolution.
[01:14:02.849 --> 01:14:05.210]  Yeah, they're reducing the language down where people can't even communicate.
[01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:07.850]  We have cut the links between child and parent.
[01:14:08.471 --> 01:14:10.491]  And between man and man.
[01:14:10.731 --> 01:14:11.791]  And between man and woman.
[01:14:12.371 --> 01:14:15.592]  No one dared trust his wife or child or a friend any longer.
[01:14:15.992 --> 01:14:18.652]  But in the future there will be no wives and no friends.
[01:14:18.672 --> 01:14:20.953]  Remember I played that clip from North Korean slave camp?
[01:14:21.373 --> 01:14:26.234]  Where they take them and then let them breed for one week a year or five days and then separate the children.
[01:14:27.054 --> 01:14:29.898]  I mean, this is domestication.
[01:14:29.918 --> 01:14:35.646]  150 years ago, the British tacticians openly said this was the game plan.
[01:14:35.666 --> 01:14:36.968]  And 150 years later, it's here.
[01:14:40.333 --> 01:14:41.134]  We're now entering it.
[01:14:51.479 --> 01:14:56.042]  We have cut the links between child and parent, and between man and man, and between man and woman.
[01:14:56.523 --> 01:14:59.185]  No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer.
[01:14:59.765 --> 01:15:02.307]  But in the future, there will be no wives and no friends.
[01:15:03.267 --> 01:15:07.711]  Children will be taken from their mothers at birth, as one takes eggs from a hen.
[01:15:09.059 --> 01:15:11.280]  The sex instinct will be eradicated.
[01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:14.021]  Procreation will be an animal formality.
[01:15:14.041 --> 01:15:19.402]  And notice porn's actually making people not enjoy it now, and to make it a reflex, like going to the bathroom.
[01:15:19.883 --> 01:15:21.043]  No passion, no love.
[01:15:21.883 --> 01:15:26.725]  Procreation will be an annual formality, like the renewal of a ration card.
[01:15:27.759 --> 01:15:29.200]  We shall abolish the orgasm.
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:32.601]  Our neurologists are at work upon it now.
[01:15:33.221 --> 01:15:35.722]  There will be no loyalty except loyalty towards the party.
[01:15:36.062 --> 01:15:38.203]  There will be no love except the love of Big Brother.
[01:15:38.483 --> 01:15:42.105]  There will be no laughter except the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy.
[01:15:42.625 --> 01:15:45.486]  There will be no art, no literature, no science.
[01:15:45.887 --> 01:15:49.008]  When we are omnipotent, we shall have no more need of science.
[01:15:49.508 --> 01:15:51.711]  There will be no distinction between beauty and ugliness.
[01:15:52.172 --> 01:15:55.296]  There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life.
[01:15:55.837 --> 01:15:57.439]  All competing pleasures will be destroyed.
[01:15:57.740 --> 01:16:02.327]  But always, do not forget this Winston, always, there will be the intoxication of power.
[01:16:03.007 --> 01:16:05.812]  Constantly increasing and continually growing
[01:16:07.583 --> 01:16:07.943]  Subtler.
[01:16:08.564 --> 01:16:14.170]  Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless.
[01:16:14.731 --> 01:16:20.156]  If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face forever.
[01:16:23.339 --> 01:16:26.543]  And when you recognize the empire of the psychopaths,
[01:16:30.055 --> 01:16:34.496]  That's what the yuppies, on the left and the right, all they care about is their victory.
[01:16:35.216 --> 01:16:38.397]  All they care about is their trampling.
[01:16:38.837 --> 01:16:50.439]  All they care about is manufacturing a fraud to pull down real men and people of honor and people of will who actually feel and love and are open.
[01:16:56.681 --> 01:16:57.741]  They don't like virtue.
[01:17:00.305 --> 01:17:02.006]  And they're training you to hate your fellow man.
[01:17:02.026 --> 01:17:15.069]  They're training you, as the Club of Rome states in 1991, reprinted from 1968, that they're going to create a double pincer of fake terror and fake environmental crises to capture you.
[01:17:15.109 --> 01:17:17.030]  Like a pincer beetle captures its prey.
[01:17:22.421 --> 01:17:33.545]  And I'm proud of what I've done, and I'm proud of the fact I've been true, and I'm proud of the fact that I want to be truthful, and I try to get it right, and I try to warn you, and I try to mobilize you, and I'm proud of what we've done together.
[01:17:34.205 --> 01:17:39.768]  But I also don't see myself in the position I'm in, but there's no one else.
[01:17:39.808 --> 01:17:47.931]  There's no one else who is in this position and who has the general basic understanding.
[01:17:47.951 --> 01:17:48.611]  It's quite simple.
[01:17:50.009 --> 01:17:53.791]  There's many who understand this, but not many who have got any platform to present it.
[01:17:54.051 --> 01:17:55.591]  And that's why the enemy's coming after me.
[01:17:55.611 --> 01:17:57.472]  They're coming after me on every front.
[01:17:58.413 --> 01:18:01.434]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:18:01.774 --> 01:18:05.396]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:18:05.696 --> 01:18:09.137]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[01:18:09.397 --> 01:18:15.640]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorides,
[01:18:19.002 --> 01:18:19.082]  Yes.
[01:18:19.102 --> 01:18:26.307]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems from the smallest to the largest systems.

[01:18:59.430 --> 01:19:03.092]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:19:03.453 --> 01:19:06.455]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:19:06.695 --> 01:19:08.116]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:19:08.815 --> 01:19:11.456]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:19:11.476 --> 01:19:17.658]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:19:17.858 --> 01:19:22.900]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:33.023]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:19:33.163 --> 01:19:35.263]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:19:35.504 --> 01:19:36.844]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:19:37.084 --> 01:19:39.364]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:19:39.544 --> 01:19:41.405]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:19:41.665 --> 01:19:46.466]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:19:46.826 --> 01:19:51.587]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[01:19:59.062 --> 01:20:03.405]  Healthy Hearts Club presents Heart and Body Extract.

[01:20:12.691 --> 01:20:15.033]  What if you could avoid heart attacks?
[01:20:15.573 --> 01:20:18.375]  What if you could avoid emergency room visits?
[01:20:18.875 --> 01:20:21.218]  What if you could avoid surgery?
[01:20:21.458 --> 01:20:21.819]  How?
[01:20:22.239 --> 01:20:25.523]  With this heart and body extract.
[01:20:25.543 --> 01:20:27.025]  100% organic.
[01:20:27.345 --> 01:20:28.927]  No negative side effects.
[01:20:29.507 --> 01:20:32.190]  Guaranteed to work or your money back.
[01:20:32.531 --> 01:20:33.051]  Call now!
[01:20:33.752 --> 01:20:34.833]  We're good to go.
[01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:13.782]  We have to understand that the human community is under scientific, diabolical attack.
[01:21:14.002 --> 01:21:18.284]  And we have to huddle together and educate our neighbors like our lives depend on it.
[01:21:18.324 --> 01:21:19.645]  We have to love each other.
[01:21:36.038 --> 01:21:47.712]  We have to just do little things like newsletters and posting flyers and calling into talk radio and just be vocal until the crescendo rises and people discover the psychopathic empire.
[01:21:52.338 --> 01:22:00.882]  Again, I'm not afraid of being set up or destroyed or lied about in all the hatchet jobs, except that I am now a symbol, a leader.
[01:22:01.622 --> 01:22:03.623]  And I've not been perfect in everything I've done.
[01:22:04.343 --> 01:22:06.124]  And they can cobble it together and twist it.
[01:22:07.804 --> 01:22:18.069]  And so, because I am this symbol of resistance and liberty, one of the main symbols worldwide now, and they see our growth and understand what we're doing,
[01:22:19.008 --> 01:22:23.591]  Just understand, folks, we are under dramatic sustained attack from all sides.
[01:22:23.671 --> 01:22:25.172]  COINTELPRO, you name it.
[01:22:26.112 --> 01:22:28.153]  Very dangerous groups in Austin operating.
[01:22:28.994 --> 01:22:33.456]  And if you give in to the COINTELPRO and cover it, then that gives them the power.
[01:22:37.138 --> 01:22:43.222]  If you sue them, that then ties you up, but... It's just, it's so massive.
[01:22:44.022 --> 01:22:45.123]  It's so huge.
[01:22:46.536 --> 01:22:52.697]  But if we simply activate and realize just how bad it is and start educating others, we can stop them.
[01:22:55.378 --> 01:22:58.059]  We are the priest of power, O'Brien said to Winston.
[01:23:00.199 --> 01:23:01.019]  God is power.
[01:23:01.199 --> 01:23:04.740]  This is before they'd broken Winston, O'Brien, while torturing him.
[01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:06.760]  We are the priest of power, Winston.
[01:23:07.861 --> 01:23:08.821]  God is power.
[01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:15.581]  But at present, power is only a word so far as you are concerned.
[01:23:16.461 --> 01:23:20.563]  It is time for you to gather some idea of what power means.
[01:23:21.063 --> 01:23:23.964]  The first thing you must realize is that power is collective.
[01:23:24.444 --> 01:23:27.905]  The individual only has power insofar as he ceases to be an individual.
[01:23:28.545 --> 01:23:31.546]  You know the party slogan, freedom is slavery.
[01:23:32.346 --> 01:23:35.627]  Has it ever occurred to you that it is reversible?
[01:23:36.408 --> 01:23:37.388]  Slavery is freedom?
[01:23:39.938 --> 01:23:42.460]  Alone, free, the human being is always defeated.
[01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:47.784]  It must be so, because every human being is doomed to die, which is the greatest of all failures.
[01:23:48.144 --> 01:24:01.514]  But if he can make complete, utter submission, as the globalists have done to their cult, their psycho-power cult, it has, if he can escape from his identity, if he can merge himself in the party so that the party, and that he is the party,
[01:24:02.435 --> 01:24:04.236]  Then he is all-powerful and immortal.
[01:24:04.856 --> 01:24:09.498]  The second thing for you to realize is that power is power over human beings, over the body.
[01:24:10.118 --> 01:24:11.899]  But, above all, over mind.
[01:24:12.319 --> 01:24:13.979]  Power over matter.
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:17.841]  External reality, as you would call it, is not important.
[01:24:18.501 --> 01:24:22.422]  Already, our control over matter is absolute.
[01:24:23.883 --> 01:24:26.344]  Because they believe in perception, he goes on to say.
[01:24:28.528 --> 01:24:31.209]  The lie that perception is reality.
[01:24:31.409 --> 01:24:39.111]  If you're hallucinating on PCP and jump off a hundred-story balcony window, and you believe you're flying and you're a butterfly, it's not real.
[01:24:39.631 --> 01:24:41.532]  When you hit the concrete, reality comes.
[01:24:41.592 --> 01:24:42.612]  But they're saying, no.
[01:24:43.812 --> 01:24:46.073]  We can have Americans say, ban free speech.
[01:24:46.133 --> 01:24:46.593]  It's freedom.
[01:24:47.133 --> 01:24:48.954]  We can say, shut down the gun show.
[01:24:49.014 --> 01:24:49.494]  It's freedom.
[01:24:49.974 --> 01:24:52.195]  We can say, kill a million Iraqis.
[01:24:52.255 --> 01:24:52.735]  It's freedom.
[01:24:55.612 --> 01:24:57.513]  Notice how they're obsessed with controlling the weather.
[01:24:58.233 --> 01:25:01.954]  The White House science czar gives speeches about how they're manipulating the weather.
[01:25:02.274 --> 01:25:04.815]  And then you talk to reporters and they can't even fathom it.
[01:25:05.175 --> 01:25:08.816]  Because Big Brother separately said, this doesn't exist, but we're doing it.
[01:25:08.836 --> 01:25:10.477]  2 plus 2 equals 5.
[01:25:12.304 --> 01:25:13.385]  And I say no.
[01:25:13.825 --> 01:25:17.548]  Freedom is the power to say 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[01:25:18.889 --> 01:25:24.994]  Monsanto does know that their corn is attacking people's organs.
[01:25:25.035 --> 01:25:26.776]  They do know it kills the lab animals.
[01:25:28.177 --> 01:25:29.378]  People must face that.
[01:25:29.438 --> 01:25:30.079]  They must face it.
[01:25:30.099 --> 01:25:31.140]  It's premeditated.
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:32.401]  It is known.
[01:25:33.361 --> 01:25:35.443]  Everything they're doing is by design.
[01:25:35.463 --> 01:25:41.208]  Thank you for listening to GCS.
[01:25:42.763 --> 01:25:44.944]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:25:47.405 --> 01:25:51.646]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:25:51.946 --> 01:25:56.007]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:25:56.287 --> 01:26:01.689]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:26:02.029 --> 01:26:02.489]  It's true.
[01:26:02.789 --> 01:26:07.331]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:26:07.651 --> 01:26:08.191]  Number 3.
[01:26:08.471 --> 01:26:11.752]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:26:12.052 --> 01:26:15.753]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:26:15.973 --> 01:26:16.513]  Number 4.
[01:26:16.773 --> 01:26:19.134]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:26:19.514 --> 01:26:22.915]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:26:23.195 --> 01:26:23.415]  Number 5.
[01:26:23.995 --> 01:26:27.916]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:26:28.136 --> 01:26:32.897]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:26:33.197 --> 01:26:37.239]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:26:37.359 --> 01:26:38.939]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:26:39.139 --> 01:26:41.220]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:43.741]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:27:10.717 --> 01:27:13.898]  Richard Reeves is scheduled to be in studio with us in 30 minutes.
[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:22.681]  If you question the Big Brother level of fraud, look at how the U.N.
[01:27:22.701 --> 01:27:29.824]  has now been forced to admit they've been engaged in premeditated fraud on ClimateGate, on the Himalayas, on the temperature readings across the planet.
[01:27:30.464 --> 01:27:30.764]  U.N.
[01:27:31.104 --> 01:27:37.767]  documents have been released the last three months, we've covered here on air, where they organized scores of key universities worldwide to
[01:27:38.627 --> 01:27:39.568]  Collate the data.
[01:27:39.969 --> 01:27:40.890]  Create the fraud.
[01:27:41.531 --> 01:27:45.055]  They say in the documents that these are fellow travelers from world government.
[01:27:45.376 --> 01:27:48.700]  I mean, this is a cult of control freaks that want to run your life.
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:50.162]  Want to control your speech.
[01:27:50.402 --> 01:27:51.143]  Disarm you.
[01:27:52.004 --> 01:27:53.326]  Herd you into compact cities.
[01:27:57.915 --> 01:28:00.696]  Look at how their fraud on the flu shot has been exposed.
[01:28:00.836 --> 01:28:02.657]  Look at how it's now come out.
[01:28:03.157 --> 01:28:04.517]  I mean, how dumb do they think you were?
[01:28:05.378 --> 01:28:08.439]  Sure, one big group of the population will buy anything, but others don't now.
[01:28:08.499 --> 01:28:09.259]  That's the good news.
[01:28:09.299 --> 01:28:09.859]  There is hope.
[01:28:10.999 --> 01:28:15.961]  We're not in this total 1984 society yet, but we've got to fight and struggle against it now.
[01:28:16.601 --> 01:28:26.845]  And 90% of the battle, as the Pentagon says, or as O'Brien, the fictional big brother enforcer, would say, all of it is in the mind.
[01:28:28.444 --> 01:28:29.565]  Because they're selling a lie.
[01:28:31.286 --> 01:28:35.869]  When CBS News locally tells you mercury is good for your children's brains, I mean, can you imagine O'Brien?
[01:28:36.769 --> 01:28:39.531]  He's saying, Winston, you must agree that 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[01:28:40.692 --> 01:28:41.713]  And Winston's like, no.
[01:28:42.993 --> 01:28:46.736]  And then later he tortures him, he says, okay, 2 plus 2 equals 5, I agree with you.
[01:28:46.756 --> 01:28:48.657]  He said, no, you don't really believe it.
[01:28:48.857 --> 01:28:51.519]  He tortures him for months more, his teeth all fall out.
[01:28:54.661 --> 01:28:57.383]  And he stands him up and says, look at you, look at how pathetic you are.
[01:28:58.171 --> 01:29:04.234]  He tortures him some more, and then Winston sees the two fingers merge into five.
[01:29:05.015 --> 01:29:07.896]  He sees the groups of two fingers merge into five.
[01:29:07.936 --> 01:29:10.318]  He, he, oh, it is five.
[01:29:10.418 --> 01:29:11.799]  Mercury is good for me.
[01:29:11.979 --> 01:29:14.820]  I, Monsanto doesn't want to hurt me.
[01:29:16.541 --> 01:29:22.605]  Monsanto, okay, sure, it's killing me, but we can't talk about it or do anything about it because, you know, that would be unfriendly towards Monsanto.
[01:29:24.414 --> 01:29:25.394]  They might come after me.
[01:29:25.834 --> 01:29:30.696]  They might sue me if I read the official medical studies on it and tell people.
[01:29:34.057 --> 01:29:35.238]  That is 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[01:29:36.518 --> 01:29:39.979]  And people do it every day, going, oh yes, I think we should ban free speech.
[01:29:43.700 --> 01:29:45.361]  Oh yes, I think we should ban guns.
[01:29:46.081 --> 01:29:47.382]  Well, that's not in the Constitution.
[01:29:47.622 --> 01:29:48.542]  See, they start out with
[01:29:50.882 --> 01:29:57.690]  With equations that are more complex, like, well, does 997 plus 1422 come up to this number?
[01:29:57.950 --> 01:30:02.436]  And it's a wrong number, but you're lazy and go, I'll just believe it's whatever you say it is.
[01:30:03.457 --> 01:30:06.480]  And then pretty soon they say, 2 plus 2 does not equal 4, it equals 5.
[01:30:06.981 --> 01:30:08.323]  Or 10 or 20 or whatever we say.
[01:30:13.247 --> 01:30:16.268]  And so they're practicing that lie on you.
[01:30:16.408 --> 01:30:25.232]  I mean, to come out and say, here's the fact sheet we're going to give you that the feds wrote up at the school or the government building or at the pharmacy.
[01:30:25.852 --> 01:30:26.932]  And here's a little fact sheet.
[01:30:26.952 --> 01:30:28.073]  It has no mercury in it.
[01:30:28.533 --> 01:30:30.454]  We've shown you these over and over again, side by side.
[01:30:30.754 --> 01:30:32.054]  Doesn't cause any problems.
[01:30:32.094 --> 01:30:33.775]  Doesn't have any neurological disorders.
[01:30:33.835 --> 01:30:34.575]  Can't hurt you.
[01:30:35.495 --> 01:30:36.776]  And then you actually get the insert.
[01:30:38.815 --> 01:30:41.496]  And it admits all the bad things it can do to you.
[01:30:41.516 --> 01:30:42.977]  See, they think you're so stupid.
[01:30:45.899 --> 01:30:46.519]  They're bold.
[01:30:46.999 --> 01:30:47.600]  They're bold.
[01:30:48.900 --> 01:30:51.962]  Now, there is still time to change this.
[01:30:53.583 --> 01:30:56.945]  Several TV stations, I saw the newscast on YouTube,
[01:30:58.166 --> 01:31:01.570]  Ran pieces that were 90% truth last night.
[01:31:01.670 --> 01:31:05.315]  CBS and the reporter came over and said, I'm a listener.
[01:31:05.335 --> 01:31:08.378]  He was very, he had a very, I mean, he was real.
[01:31:09.019 --> 01:31:11.182]  And he was like, okay, fine.
[01:31:11.242 --> 01:31:12.303]  Let us try to get it right.
[01:31:12.663 --> 01:31:14.566]  And they got it pretty close.
[01:31:17.116 --> 01:31:19.258]  So see, they weren't evil and diabolical.
[01:31:19.278 --> 01:31:22.640]  They were just going with the peer pressure of the ATF and the Austin Police Department.
[01:31:22.861 --> 01:31:23.461]  That's what the guy said.
[01:31:23.481 --> 01:31:25.723]  He said, we just reported what they told us, Alex.
[01:31:26.463 --> 01:31:28.045]  But see, you didn't go look it up.
[01:31:28.785 --> 01:31:32.308]  They even said on the news, Alex claims this is the federal law, as I read it on air.
[01:31:32.468 --> 01:31:33.549]  But at least they did that.
[01:31:34.089 --> 01:31:37.052]  That there is no, that the law is you can have private sale of firearms.
[01:31:37.132 --> 01:31:39.534]  We turned them around because I screamed at them.
[01:31:40.274 --> 01:31:42.135]  I went and got in their face and rebuked them.
[01:31:42.695 --> 01:31:48.237]  I didn't sit up there in a little beauty pageant, barely talking on a megaphone where nobody could hear, you know, oh, you know.
[01:31:49.358 --> 01:31:53.200]  No, I was there to wage war on fraud, wage war on lies.
[01:31:53.580 --> 01:31:56.321]  I was there to psychically assault them with the truth.
[01:31:58.342 --> 01:32:00.943]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:32:01.343 --> 01:32:06.306]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:32:06.666 --> 01:32:08.406]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:32:08.727 --> 01:32:13.549]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:32:13.729 --> 01:32:14.689]  How much do you want?
[01:32:14.909 --> 01:32:15.650]  When do you want it?
[01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:17.631]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:32:17.911 --> 01:32:18.731]  When will you need it?
[01:32:18.991 --> 01:32:20.992]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:32:21.172 --> 01:32:22.292]  Will there be any food?
[01:32:22.513 --> 01:32:23.853]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:32:24.053 --> 01:32:29.115]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:32:29.315 --> 01:32:32.496]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:32.897 --> 01:32:36.358]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:32:36.718 --> 01:32:37.699]  How much will you need?
[01:32:37.939 --> 01:32:38.559]  We don't know.
[01:32:38.839 --> 01:32:39.760]  How much do you want?
[01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:40.680]  All you can get.
[01:32:40.881 --> 01:32:41.721]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:32:41.981 --> 01:32:44.743]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:33:04.265 --> 01:33:05.505]  No, this isn't science fiction.

[01:34:08.736 --> 01:34:09.857]  The answer is simple.
[01:34:10.137 --> 01:34:11.438]  PureBulk.com.

[01:35:06.024 --> 01:35:08.386]  Okay, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:35:09.246 --> 01:35:10.767]  Let's talk to David in Oklahoma.
[01:35:10.787 --> 01:35:11.648]  David, you're on the air.
[01:35:11.708 --> 01:35:12.228]  Welcome, sir.
[01:35:13.409 --> 01:35:13.829]  Hello!
[01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.930]  Welcome.
[01:35:15.831 --> 01:35:16.831]  Hey, Alex.
[01:35:16.911 --> 01:35:20.594]  First off, I just want to say I thank God for you and what you do.
[01:35:21.074 --> 01:35:31.421]  I was awakened about a little over a year ago, and the process eventually led me to the Obama deception and endgame and loose change and
[01:35:32.802 --> 01:35:36.305]  Dr. Stanley Monteith read his book, Brotherhood of Darkness, in the whole nine.
[01:35:36.745 --> 01:35:43.771]  The thing that I wanted to ask is, I'm a Christian and I've read the Bible cover to cover several times, so I know how it is.
[01:35:44.672 --> 01:35:48.335]  And I hear you and I hear other guests talk about how we're going to win.
[01:35:48.796 --> 01:35:54.961]  Well, I want to know what you mean when you say we're going to win or we can win this.
[01:35:55.161 --> 01:35:56.162]  Tell me what you mean by that.
[01:35:57.537 --> 01:35:58.898]  That's a great question, David.
[01:35:58.958 --> 01:36:00.719]  We're going to win our souls.
[01:36:00.879 --> 01:36:08.663]  We're going to stand up against evil and not cop out and say we're going to be teleported by Scotty in the rapture that's non-existent in the Bible.
[01:36:10.864 --> 01:36:11.484]  Until after.
[01:36:12.525 --> 01:36:16.847]  And we're going to stand against evil and be tested in the fire.
[01:36:17.808 --> 01:36:20.189]  And in the end, good is going to win.
[01:36:21.650 --> 01:36:23.691]  And so I don't get up here and debate
[01:36:24.682 --> 01:36:25.422]  Theology.
[01:36:25.602 --> 01:36:26.342]  I've read the Bible.
[01:36:26.403 --> 01:36:26.923]  I've studied it.
[01:36:27.003 --> 01:36:27.803]  I know what it says.
[01:36:27.823 --> 01:36:31.144]  I know it says the beast will make war on the saints and overcome them.
[01:36:31.524 --> 01:36:33.004]  But that means the saints are going to fight it.
[01:36:33.584 --> 01:36:39.106]  But in the greatest awakening to this dehumanizing force, that's what it is.
[01:36:39.126 --> 01:36:41.307]  It's death and disease and pain.
[01:36:41.327 --> 01:36:42.527]  That's beautiful to Satan.
[01:36:43.187 --> 01:36:44.307]  And Satan is a spirit.
[01:36:44.347 --> 01:36:44.908]  It is real.
[01:36:46.028 --> 01:36:49.729]  There is a mystery of evil, as the Bible talks about, guiding this force.
[01:36:52.148 --> 01:36:56.332]  And I can feel the good, I can feel the evil.
[01:36:58.935 --> 01:37:08.564]  So the cop-out that I see from the false, Christianoid, plastic, fake, mannequin church that isn't real, it's like a mannequin of a man or woman, it's not a human.
[01:37:14.411 --> 01:37:23.917]  I mean, the reason I know the Bible is profound, inspired by the Creator, is that people talk about Nostradamus.
[01:37:24.257 --> 01:37:26.379]  They're incredibly vague.
[01:37:26.659 --> 01:37:32.002]  The king will be struck on the horse and the spear will go in his eye.
[01:37:32.062 --> 01:37:34.004]  Well, kings back then fought in wars.
[01:37:34.884 --> 01:37:40.787]  And that was one of the most common ways they were killed, was someone with a sword or a spear or an arrow through the visor.
[01:37:40.807 --> 01:37:47.991]  It's one of the few places they could, they would be in heavy battle armor, would take a crane to put them on the giant war horse, the big Clydesdale.
[01:37:48.852 --> 01:37:51.433]  I mean, that's how you'd know the king, because they would have the heaviest armor.
[01:37:52.073 --> 01:38:00.158]  And so, oh my gosh, this quattrain, you know, a hundred years later, the king of France was killed jousting.
[01:38:00.638 --> 01:38:04.966]  The jousting spear went into his visor.
[01:38:04.986 --> 01:38:08.712]  I mean, that's not prophecy.
[01:38:09.153 --> 01:38:14.141]  You read Ezekiel and Daniel and Revelations and it is
[01:38:15.939 --> 01:38:22.326]  Uh, giant metal insects dropping eggs that are, you know, that turn into giant pillars of fire.
[01:38:22.346 --> 01:38:23.347]  I mean, that's, that's nukes.
[01:38:23.968 --> 01:38:35.581]  It is, it is a world system where the image of the beast is seen by all, television, and, and, and that there's moving images of the beast on the streets, and it describes holograms and robots.
[01:38:36.141 --> 01:38:40.144]  And how you must buy or sell, and it's the hand or the face, the body scan.
[01:38:40.765 --> 01:38:48.171]  They're now scanning you in these scanners to get your full biometric scan, where they can passively, not just in airports, but from the street, know who you are, even if you wear a mask.
[01:38:48.471 --> 01:38:53.615]  Shoots through your clothes and has the digital... Let he who hath understanding reckon the number.
[01:38:53.635 --> 01:38:54.636]  It is a number of a man.
[01:38:54.896 --> 01:38:59.981]  The digital calculation of a man's body, of your face, of your hand.
[01:39:01.460 --> 01:39:25.462]  And it just goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and how there will be ten kingdoms, and how there will be, and then you read the Club of Rome and UN, and the UN calls it ten kingdoms, and it will be ruled by a monetary system, and it will be a false church, and it's just, it's, it's, it's, it's unbelievable, and you can't read Revelation
[01:39:26.848 --> 01:39:31.393]  And those visions on the Isle of Patmos and not... I mean, it's not vague.
[01:39:31.974 --> 01:39:32.595]  It's not vague.
[01:39:32.615 --> 01:39:35.478]  And it says, the merchants of the world traffic in men's souls.
[01:39:35.538 --> 01:39:38.041]  That's what they're really into, is control of the mind.
[01:39:38.281 --> 01:39:43.126]  What O'Brien is saying to Winston, the mind is everything, the soul, what people believe.
[01:39:44.067 --> 01:39:46.209]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[01:39:49.787 --> 01:39:58.950]  I'm just here to tell people what's happening and what the New World Order is doing, and I have found that Bible-thumping, pushy Christians can't wake up anybody.
[01:39:59.390 --> 01:40:08.733]  But I, this radio show, has so many people have not found the organized religion and the churches, but they have found a relationship with the Creator.
[01:40:09.493 --> 01:40:12.714]  And their heart is right, and they now understand and are getting themselves ready.
[01:40:13.495 --> 01:40:14.855]  Ready for what we're going into.
[01:40:16.095 --> 01:40:16.276]  And I
[01:40:18.755 --> 01:40:21.136]  Just want to try to be a pure and virtuous person.
[01:40:21.696 --> 01:40:29.599]  I want to try to transcend my flesh and be the true leader that we're all meant to be.
[01:40:33.361 --> 01:40:34.982]  Because as a symbol of liberty
[01:40:36.175 --> 01:40:36.355]  This is
[01:40:53.999 --> 01:40:57.262]  Because they understand and they don't want people to realize there are good people.
[01:40:57.282 --> 01:40:58.903]  They don't want people to realize there are good leaders.
[01:40:58.923 --> 01:41:03.427]  They don't want people to realize because then a leader then reflects on you and you become a leader.
[01:41:03.667 --> 01:41:06.669]  They don't want you to believe there's anything real, anything bonafide.
[01:41:06.689 --> 01:41:07.710]  There's just more evil.
[01:41:08.711 --> 01:41:10.292]  And so it's just incredible.
[01:41:10.312 --> 01:41:14.896]  I mean, I feel the spirit of the Creator and it embraces me.
[01:41:16.001 --> 01:41:23.668]  With chills, as the Creator says, you know, you've done well, but now you truly know more than you did before.
[01:41:23.708 --> 01:41:24.989]  Now you have the discernment.
[01:41:25.049 --> 01:41:26.150]  Now you have the knowledge.
[01:41:26.170 --> 01:41:27.030]  There's no excuse.
[01:41:27.431 --> 01:41:28.592]  You have to be even better.
[01:41:29.713 --> 01:41:34.437]  And then I say, why me, God?
[01:41:34.537 --> 01:41:37.119]  Why am I in this position?
[01:41:37.780 --> 01:41:39.181]  Why have I been given this burden?
[01:41:39.201 --> 01:41:41.483]  You know, they say with great wisdom comes great sorrow.
[01:41:44.123 --> 01:41:48.708]  And then, why can't I articulate and teach what I know and understand?
[01:41:48.728 --> 01:41:56.175]  And the answer is, at a certain level, you know, some are not even meant to understand what I'm saying.
[01:41:56.615 --> 01:42:00.219]  Some can't even understand it right now, because they've hardened their hearts.
[01:42:00.739 --> 01:42:07.926]  My heart gets softer and softer and bigger, and it's full of more love, and it just, I don't even know how to describe it.
[01:42:08.908 --> 01:42:11.569]  And I just, I just want the evil to stop.
[01:42:11.709 --> 01:42:14.229]  I want the hurting of the little ones to stop.
[01:42:14.249 --> 01:42:19.750]  I mean, do you understand what I'm saying, David?
[01:42:19.770 --> 01:42:21.330]  Yeah, I understand.
[01:42:21.370 --> 01:42:26.731]  And you know, that's the whole thing that Jesus talked about, that there would be a day when all that stops.
[01:42:27.192 --> 01:42:34.633]  And the reason that it exists is because of the fact that the people who are in power now are under the influence of the original rebel.
[01:42:35.351 --> 01:42:40.212]  As described in Saul Alinsky's book, the way he dedicated that book to the original rebel, Satan.
[01:42:40.532 --> 01:42:43.473]  And then had the nerve to say, at least he got his own kingdom out of the deal.
[01:42:43.833 --> 01:42:50.315]  Well, the thing about it is, this is turning out to be, you know, the kingdom of Satan.
[01:42:50.755 --> 01:42:51.075]  Okay?
[01:42:51.355 --> 01:42:52.815]  So... There's no doubt.
[01:42:52.835 --> 01:43:02.518]  I mean, even if people don't believe in the old serpent as an entity, collectively what's being manifested and what the elite are turning us into is hell.
[01:43:04.687 --> 01:43:16.469]  The thing about it is, Alex, you mentioned earlier, and I saw, I was watching the program, because I get the simulcast and all that, and I was watching where Mr. Dice was doing the interviews yesterday.
[01:43:17.049 --> 01:43:22.630]  Well, the thing about that is that every human being has been infected with a lie.
[01:43:22.910 --> 01:43:23.970]  We believe a lie.
[01:43:24.250 --> 01:43:32.772]  That's why these people come across as though they're God, because the original lie that the human race believed was that you can be God.
[01:43:34.525 --> 01:43:35.726]  They still believe that.
[01:43:36.626 --> 01:43:37.807]  Yeah, they think they're God.
[01:43:38.627 --> 01:43:49.193]  You're talking about, at the Capitol, he's literally 60, 70 yards away from cops, where they said the media could be, and he marches up and just gets in his face, and is looking at Aaron like he wants to kill him.
[01:43:50.234 --> 01:43:50.454]  Wow.
[01:43:51.475 --> 01:43:52.275]  Have you seen that video?
[01:43:53.196 --> 01:44:02.061]  No, I haven't seen that part, but I'm talking about where yesterday on your program you gave a snippet of, I think it was Dice,
[01:44:02.785 --> 01:44:03.586]  Everybody has that.
[01:44:03.606 --> 01:44:04.687]  Everybody has that.
[01:44:04.747 --> 01:44:07.229]  Now before I was awakened,
[01:44:27.065 --> 01:44:30.547]  And I can't say that I woke up, I was awakened, okay?
[01:44:31.007 --> 01:44:37.530]  I had similar views, not the totalitarian type of thing where if you defend against this view, you need to shut up.
[01:44:37.590 --> 01:44:37.850]  No!
[01:44:38.230 --> 01:44:42.412]  But the thing about it is I had disdain for people who didn't think as I thought.
[01:44:42.732 --> 01:44:46.774]  And now, whereas now, I mean, you know, the whole left-right thing has been shattered for me.
[01:44:46.834 --> 01:44:49.255]  I mean, totally just blown to smithereens.
[01:44:49.575 --> 01:44:53.076]  Every talk show that I get to call into, and I'm a truck driver, so I get to listen all day.
[01:44:53.517 --> 01:44:56.398]  So every show that I call into, the first thing is,
[01:44:57.048 --> 01:44:59.189]  You're coming at this from the wrong perspective.
[01:44:59.409 --> 01:45:00.410]  There is no left, right?
[01:45:00.450 --> 01:45:01.110]  They're all one.
[01:45:02.391 --> 01:45:22.884]  So, you know... But if I've done one thing, if I've done one thing, David, is I coined the left-right paradigm term, I've hammered it for 14 years, really about 12 when I really woke up to that fully, for about 12 years, and now people go, wait, I've been kept in this little box, there's a whole other system?
[01:45:24.008 --> 01:45:27.751]  I gotta tell you, the first time I saw the Obama deception, I stayed up.
[01:45:27.931 --> 01:45:30.833]  I thought somehow it was some
[01:45:47.594 --> 01:45:57.179]  Vision Revisited or something website that I clicked onto, and then it led me to the Obama deception, and I could not sleep.
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:45:59.641]  It was about a year ago.
[01:45:59.741 --> 01:46:03.783]  Right about, it was like the first or second week of February, or third week of February, somewhere around there.
[01:46:04.163 --> 01:46:05.184]  Somewhere around that area.
[01:46:05.944 --> 01:46:10.426]  It was shortly after the movie first came out, and I couldn't sleep.
[01:46:10.767 --> 01:46:12.688]  And I was up for like two days straight.
[01:46:13.068 --> 01:46:16.069]  I'm like, and I'm just devouring all of the information that's coming.
[01:46:17.867 --> 01:46:24.670]  When I found out about eight, nine years ago that the eugenics was absolutely real, going on worse than I thought, I actually threw up.
[01:46:34.016 --> 01:46:48.443]  I actually, my mouth started watering and it was like a, you know, a spiritual thing, a physical manifestation of my soul was just like, bleh, when I realized, because my body, my soul, my subconscious already knew all this information at a base level.
[01:46:49.063 --> 01:46:56.927]  But it was the conscious binding of that and realizing it and the images of the children they're murdering and it was just, bleh, you know, just,
[01:46:59.770 --> 01:47:05.991]  If you owe the IRS money you can't pay, then listen carefully because you already know that the problem won't go away by itself.

[01:47:58.052 --> 01:48:07.795]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[01:48:08.076 --> 01:48:12.157]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system.
[01:48:12.557 --> 01:48:23.361]  Wisdom being lost with time, the government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[01:48:23.741 --> 01:48:32.653]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[01:48:32.933 --> 01:48:37.519]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[01:48:37.539 --> 01:48:39.101]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:48:39.342 --> 01:48:41.845]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[01:48:42.105 --> 01:48:43.005]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[01:48:43.145 --> 01:48:49.267]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[01:48:49.608 --> 01:48:50.328]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[01:48:50.348 --> 01:48:50.648]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[01:48:50.668 --> 01:48:53.449]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:48:53.469 --> 01:48:55.130]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:48:55.190 --> 01:48:56.790]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:49:08.692 --> 01:49:11.355]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:49:11.375 --> 01:49:17.580]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:49:17.761 --> 01:49:22.785]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:49:23.306 --> 01:49:32.955]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:49:33.055 --> 01:49:35.176]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:49:35.396 --> 01:49:36.737]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:49:36.997 --> 01:49:39.258]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:49:39.438 --> 01:49:41.278]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:49:41.579 --> 01:49:46.341]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:49:46.721 --> 01:49:51.503]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:49:51.723 --> 01:49:55.824]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:49:58.220 --> 01:49:58.721]  We're good to go.
[01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:14.120]  We're good to go.
[01:50:32.449 --> 01:50:32.989]  That's right.
[01:51:03.206 --> 01:51:07.969]  Ira hates you.
[01:51:11.391 --> 01:51:14.873]  Ira hates you.
[01:51:18.324 --> 01:51:28.628]  One of the most painful things in my life is knowing that, with my listeners, we've woken up tens of millions of people.
[01:51:29.309 --> 01:51:39.953]  And to see the system, not just Glenn Beck and others at the top, but lower down, groups that co-opt it, co-opt all the work we've done, and then turn it into something nasty with their COINTELPRO tricks.
[01:51:40.713 --> 01:51:44.515]  Most of the idiots dancing to the tune and the string don't even know they're doing it.
[01:51:46.377 --> 01:51:47.578]  But again, that's going to happen.
[01:51:48.359 --> 01:51:54.625]  I mean, if you wake people up that they're being lied to, that doesn't necessarily mean that they're not going to be lied to at other levels.
[01:51:54.985 --> 01:52:01.372]  So you can't look at other people failing, other people falling, other people's problems, all the nastiness, and get wrapped up in it.
[01:52:01.892 --> 01:52:16.125]  You've just got to continue to love God and love what's true and love honor and love beauty and love decency and love innocence and stand up against the New World Order and give the people an alternative to say, this is your enemy, the New World Order.
[01:52:16.145 --> 01:52:16.966]  Look what they've done to you.
[01:52:17.306 --> 01:52:19.228]  Look what the other opportunities could be.
[01:52:19.628 --> 01:52:20.910]  Look at what history has shown.
[01:52:21.710 --> 01:52:23.031]  Chris in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:52:23.072 --> 01:52:23.352]  Welcome.
[01:52:26.545 --> 01:52:47.993]  Alex, it is your life to revamp, and I respect your life choices, but when it comes down to your life, your own life, and your empathy for the lives of others, it's really, I think it's obvious from your predictions coming true that you do have a greater forethought to see how the thoughts and the actions
[01:52:49.093 --> 01:52:49.554]  We're good.
[01:53:07.589 --> 01:53:14.514]  It's your sense of concern that would still bring you these greater insights and an even deeper connection with God.
[01:53:14.654 --> 01:53:18.137]  But no matter what you choose, God works through everyone.
[01:53:18.377 --> 01:53:22.460]  Earlier I was saying I just miss not being able to see my grandmother or spend as much time with my kids.
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:26.022]  So I feel like my time is stolen by having to fight this.
[01:53:26.082 --> 01:53:28.524]  It's not like it's some delicious pleasure.
[01:53:29.204 --> 01:53:32.587]  Ten years ago it was kind of the worldly triumph of defeating them.
[01:53:32.927 --> 01:53:34.568]  And I still get happy when we have victories.
[01:53:34.608 --> 01:53:35.329]  That's not bad.
[01:53:35.849 --> 01:53:36.390]  It's just that
[01:53:37.458 --> 01:53:40.680]  That now, I just, I mean, it's like, whoa, I know too much.
[01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:43.022]  I mean, it just gets deeper and deeper and deeper.
[01:53:43.722 --> 01:53:54.330]  And the understanding, it just accelerates to the point of like, I'm saying, God, you know, whatever you want me to do, I'm going to do, but this is really hard to handle.
[01:53:55.771 --> 01:54:02.679]  Well, it never ends, and when it comes to Reverend James David Manning, I wanted to speak with him and ask him this.
[01:54:03.239 --> 01:54:05.982]  He has a right to say that Obama ought to be tried for treason.
[01:54:06.042 --> 01:54:15.633]  I agree that Barack is the butcher, but he's also an unindicted war criminal, and his treasonous, he's illegitimate by virtue of his lies and the Constitution.
[01:54:16.273 --> 01:54:21.959]  But to anybody who seeks the death penalty, I just ask, would you cast the first stone?
[01:54:21.979 --> 01:54:23.360]  Would you pull the switch?
[01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:25.902]  Would you open the trapdoor below the noose?
[01:54:26.163 --> 01:54:35.492]  And as punishment for such war criminals, I would only suggest isolation from power, sequestering from society.
[01:54:35.512 --> 01:54:37.854]  Well, yeah, here's the danger of the death penalty.
[01:54:37.934 --> 01:54:38.554]  I mean, if you're in a...
[01:54:39.315 --> 01:54:45.598]  In a village 5,000 years ago and somebody kills your kid, the village is going to grab the person that was seen doing it and they're going to kill him.
[01:54:45.638 --> 01:54:46.899]  And that's a good thing.
[01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:53.042]  The problem is that government is always so much more evil than just the individual criminal.
[01:54:53.323 --> 01:54:56.925]  And we know more than a third of people on death row are innocent from DNA.
[01:54:58.145 --> 01:55:00.026]  And we know the government does frame people.
[01:55:00.727 --> 01:55:08.271]  And we know they now torture people for confessions and are saying that's admissible in court now as they set the precedence with the trials coming up in New York.
[01:55:09.170 --> 01:55:14.108]  And so, the government can't be trusted to carry out the death penalty.
[01:55:14.890 --> 01:55:18.091]  Because it is the evil.
[01:55:18.711 --> 01:55:20.992]  And so, that's my problem.
[01:55:21.532 --> 01:55:29.894]  But then, at an instinctive level, when I see them catch some person that kidnapped 10 or 15 women and tortured them to death, and they admit to it, I say, kill them.
[01:55:31.314 --> 01:55:35.415]  But at the same time, that means they're also going to kill a bunch of innocent people.
[01:55:35.895 --> 01:55:40.296]  And it's better that 100 guilty men go free than one innocent man be killed.
[01:55:40.776 --> 01:55:43.497]  So, do you see the point I'm making?
[01:55:44.892 --> 01:55:45.813]  Well, absolutely.
[01:55:45.953 --> 01:55:51.677]  But I wouldn't even be more gratifying and constructive to offer amnesty to encourage them to sing like a bird.
[01:55:51.737 --> 01:55:55.100]  I mean, that would be a lot more constructive than putting them to death.
[01:55:55.200 --> 01:56:02.746]  And these puppets like Obama are ill in that they do embrace the concept that their masters consider them expendable.
[01:56:02.786 --> 01:56:10.512]  The last thing I want for cynical, despotic dictators is to see him or her, in my own belief, to see them reincarnate.
[01:56:10.992 --> 01:56:12.453]  And I care for Reverend Manning's
[01:56:13.454 --> 01:56:13.935]  I think so.
[01:56:29.286 --> 01:56:31.507]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:56:31.587 --> 01:56:32.748]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:56:57.537 --> 01:57:01.782]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:57:02.102 --> 01:57:02.723]  Number one.
[01:57:03.003 --> 01:57:06.167]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:57:06.427 --> 01:57:07.008]  Number two.
[01:57:07.288 --> 01:57:11.853]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:57:12.194 --> 01:57:12.634]  It's true.
[01:57:12.935 --> 01:57:14.897]  Total government control of electricity.
[01:57:15.017 --> 01:57:18.338]  In the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:57:18.618 --> 01:57:21.899]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:57:22.199 --> 01:57:26.680]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:57:26.900 --> 01:57:29.281]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:57:29.661 --> 01:57:33.002]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:57:34.142 --> 01:57:38.064]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:57:38.284 --> 01:57:43.046]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:57:43.326 --> 01:57:47.368]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:57:47.508 --> 01:57:49.069]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:57:49.289 --> 01:57:53.891]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:57:59.381 --> 01:58:03.049]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:58:03.429 --> 01:58:06.415]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:58:06.656 --> 01:58:08.058]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:58:08.780 --> 01:58:11.421]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:58:11.441 --> 01:58:17.683]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:58:17.823 --> 01:58:22.885]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:58:23.025 --> 01:58:33.009]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:58:33.129 --> 01:58:35.230]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:58:35.470 --> 01:58:36.811]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:58:37.071 --> 01:58:39.332]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:58:39.512 --> 01:58:41.353]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:58:41.373 --> 01:58:46.436]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:58:46.796 --> 01:58:55.921]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:57.734 --> 01:59:00.916]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:59:01.277 --> 01:59:03.118]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:59:03.578 --> 01:59:03.999]  Don't!
[01:59:04.439 --> 01:59:07.461]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[01:59:07.881 --> 01:59:08.482]  Why pay?
[01:59:08.682 --> 01:59:15.006]  When you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[01:59:14.986 --> 01:59:16.648]  's number one debt secret.
[01:59:16.968 --> 01:59:20.671]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[01:59:21.051 --> 01:59:23.753]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[01:59:24.173 --> 01:59:31.201]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[01:59:31.221 --> 01:59:32.542]  Herb K was right.
[01:59:32.742 --> 01:59:35.826]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[01:59:35.926 --> 01:59:36.927]  What have you got to lose?
[01:59:37.287 --> 01:59:40.411]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money!
[01:59:40.971 --> 01:59:44.636]  Get Herb K's number one death secret absolutely free now!
[01:59:44.916 --> 01:59:45.457]  Call 888-352-7726.
[01:59:45.477 --> 01:59:45.837]  That's 888-352-7726.
[01:59:45.857 --> 01:59:45.897]  888-352-7726.
[02:00:06.925 --> 02:00:08.485]  I'm not going to belabor this.
[02:00:09.066 --> 02:00:10.426]  We've got Richard Reeves in the studio.
[02:00:10.446 --> 02:00:12.087]  I'm about to go to him in here in just a moment.
[02:00:13.088 --> 02:00:15.489]  But people are ready to learn the truth.
[02:00:16.250 --> 02:00:19.692]  When you purchase the videos, you don't just get a weapon to wake somebody up in the info war.
[02:00:19.772 --> 02:00:21.212]  You also support our operation.
[02:00:21.553 --> 02:00:23.334]  We're expanding, building the TV studio.
[02:00:23.754 --> 02:00:25.575]  Finally got the permits, and that's ongoing now.
[02:00:25.975 --> 02:00:27.576]  You may even hear a lot of banging and stuff.
[02:00:27.596 --> 02:00:34.119]  I don't know what we're going to do, because they're going to be working 12 hours a day, even though it's about 30 yards away where they're building it.
[02:00:35.180 --> 02:00:35.500]  I think?
[02:00:57.970 --> 02:01:03.898]  The profit coming in, the revenue to fund our operation would go up right on line with it until about 2007.
[02:01:06.059 --> 02:01:17.981]  And thank God, from media operation and the info war, we have just expanded and expanded and expanded and expanded and kind of like escaped the black hole that's sucking all the other media in, going bankrupt.
[02:01:18.261 --> 02:01:23.042]  And we're almost like in the new episode of a Star Trek where they're getting out of the black hole and they're barely making it.
[02:01:23.462 --> 02:01:27.743]  I mean, we're just, you know, we're pulling away, but that black hole is growing even faster.
[02:01:28.303 --> 02:01:32.924]  And so, again, we're trying to expand in the face of the new world order.
[02:01:32.944 --> 02:01:34.044]  We're trying to expand
[02:01:35.024 --> 02:01:39.128]  In the face of all of this corruption.
[02:01:40.569 --> 02:01:45.613]  And so I, again, we're trying to take it up a notch here.
[02:01:45.633 --> 02:01:47.074]  We're trying to intensify.
[02:01:47.094 --> 02:01:51.818]  And you do that by supporting us, buying the books, DVDs, the Patriot t-shirts and material.
[02:01:52.278 --> 02:01:54.260]  And I want to thank everybody who has been supporting us.
[02:01:54.300 --> 02:01:59.884]  That rally last night, I'd say over 80% of the people there were wearing Infowars.com shirts, Joker shirts.
[02:01:59.904 --> 02:02:01.185]  It was my listeners that came out.
[02:02:03.442 --> 02:02:08.307]  You'd think the other gun community in Austin would muster more than the 300 I got out there.
[02:02:09.421 --> 02:02:36.706]  uh... but uh... our listeners got out there uh... but i'm just glad a caller called me not this sunday but the sunday before i guess like nine days ago even let me know that happened at the gun show and i and we found out it was true uh... so we're now aware that is now a national a national issue began in four hours dot com the online video bookstore or prison planet dot tv five ninety five a month watch the show live all the films there uh... in high quality uh... richard reeve i want to get into deborah medina but i want to just uh... go back i got an email
[02:02:37.486 --> 02:02:40.128]  Saturday morning saying Rick Perry's going to be at Red's Indoor Range.
[02:02:40.968 --> 02:02:54.337]  And it wasn't official, so that was my one day, that one day I tried to spend the whole day with my children playing football and watching them on the scooters and walking in the woods and painting with them and stuff, so I just ignored it.
[02:02:55.118 --> 02:02:57.819]  But I should have gone down there and talked to them, but I'm glad you did.
[02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:00.021]  And Richard, you just always do great work.
[02:03:00.061 --> 02:03:05.825]  You did great work with us on the Obama deception and on Fall of the Republic with the great camera work you did.
[02:03:06.661 --> 02:03:11.065]  And just a side issue, you know, the New York Times and others said that there wasn't even a Bilderberg Group meeting.
[02:03:11.325 --> 02:03:14.208]  We were imagining cars following us and imagining Secret Service.
[02:03:14.788 --> 02:03:15.629]  You were there briefly.
[02:03:16.129 --> 02:03:16.570]  What happened?
[02:03:16.890 --> 02:03:17.290]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:03:17.310 --> 02:03:19.912]  Well, I was at the Chantilly, Virginia event with you guys.
[02:03:20.012 --> 02:03:22.655]  We all did the work together and I was there shooting video.
[02:03:23.455 --> 02:03:31.201]  And there was definitely a Bilderberg event going on there, and as many people know, Obama and Hillary were potentially there inside the Bilderberg event.
[02:03:31.301 --> 02:03:31.941]  I'm sure they were.
[02:03:31.961 --> 02:03:33.443]  It's been later confirmed.
[02:03:33.523 --> 02:03:34.984]  That's right, they were missing at the time.
[02:03:35.064 --> 02:03:41.308]  So, there was definitely a Bilderberg event there in Chantilly, Virginia, and I was there to witness and document that with you.
[02:03:41.348 --> 02:03:42.829]  That was a great honor to do that.
[02:03:43.290 --> 02:03:49.134]  But that's another 2 plus 2 equals 5, where the media just says we just imagined it all.
[02:03:49.787 --> 02:03:50.228]  Oh, well.
[02:03:50.268 --> 02:03:51.830]  We were all having a mass hallucination.
[02:03:51.950 --> 02:03:58.499]  I'm here to tell you it was not an imagined event, just like that fire alarm that happened around midnight, you know, when you're going on coast-to-coast there at the hotel.
[02:03:58.559 --> 02:03:59.720]  I mean, that wasn't imagined.
[02:03:59.780 --> 02:04:04.547]  And remember, I came back to the hotel room and me and Rob said, they just told us about don't pull fire alarms.
[02:04:04.847 --> 02:04:05.867]  That's right, that's right.
[02:04:07.548 --> 02:04:12.469]  And those guys, even though I just told them that, they, the camera crew, still couldn't believe it.
[02:04:12.809 --> 02:04:13.489]  Right, right.
[02:04:13.929 --> 02:04:17.450]  So, I mean, we could really go back and cover a lot of history that we've done together.
[02:04:17.470 --> 02:04:26.172]  You know, we went to Dallas and did some JFK shooting up there to document that, and then the Chantilly, Virginia Bilderberg event, and then you were in Canada.
[02:04:26.192 --> 02:04:27.272]  I wasn't on that trip with
[02:04:27.692 --> 02:04:41.299]  You guys up in Canada when y'all got held at the border and everything like that so it's just been quite a saga that we've all kind of lived together here and I've as a listener I've gotten to have a front row seat to most of it with you going on and I look forward to a lot more.
[02:04:41.439 --> 02:04:56.447]  I think the mainstream media is sabotaging themselves though by engaging in hoaxes with the flu and the North American Union and the SPP and the Copenhagen denying it while it's all being set up and saying there's no mercury in the shots when I mean it's really discrediting them.
[02:04:56.906 --> 02:05:02.970]  Well, absolutely, and that's one thing I do constantly on some of the programs that I do is I say, look, mainstream media, just keep it up.
[02:05:03.110 --> 02:05:03.971]  Keep up your lies.
[02:05:04.031 --> 02:05:05.032]  Keep up your omissions.
[02:05:05.112 --> 02:05:06.413]  Keep up your prevarications.
[02:05:06.813 --> 02:05:08.654]  And we're going to just obsolete you.
[02:05:09.015 --> 02:05:13.218]  It's going to be shows like yours on GCN Live and your InfoWars program.
[02:05:13.238 --> 02:05:14.899]  It's going to be shows like yours that are going to dominate.
[02:05:15.299 --> 02:05:16.120]  That's happening already.
[02:05:16.140 --> 02:05:21.967]  You were talking about how the newspapers are going into the black hole, the black abyss of non-profitability.
[02:05:22.648 --> 02:05:24.850]  As a matter of fact, they've literally shrunk in size now.
[02:05:24.910 --> 02:05:28.935]  They're actually smaller than they used to be, not only in thickness, but also in width.
[02:05:29.416 --> 02:05:31.879]  So that's what we're doing, is we're taking the mainstream media down.
[02:05:32.279 --> 02:05:35.902]  And we'll continue to do that with alternative radio programs and internet shows like yours.
[02:05:35.962 --> 02:05:40.024]  And that's where the mainstream media, we're going to have to drag them along.
[02:05:40.084 --> 02:05:42.106]  And in some cases they are being dragged along.
[02:05:42.566 --> 02:05:49.951]  And thankfully at least they're willing to at least report on some of this news to where we can go in and read between the lines and decide for what's going on in the world.
[02:05:49.991 --> 02:05:52.613]  So I'll tell you briefly about the very successful protest last night.
[02:05:52.633 --> 02:05:53.854]  I want to thank everybody for coming out there.
[02:05:53.874 --> 02:05:54.754]  It was great meeting folks.
[02:05:57.734 --> 02:06:01.515]  I believe it's the same CBS Black reporter.
[02:06:02.135 --> 02:06:10.078]  I forgot his name, but he looked like the guy who was in the earlier CBS reports, reading what the police told him, that it is illegal to have private sales.
[02:06:10.118 --> 02:06:12.598]  And I showed him the law, and he said, well look, don't get mad at us.
[02:06:12.939 --> 02:06:14.339]  We just reported what the police told us.
[02:06:15.039 --> 02:06:16.680]  And then they did the right thing, actually.
[02:06:17.120 --> 02:06:22.361]  After I showed him the law, they actually put it on the news, and it was a 90% accurate report instead of 100% baloney.
[02:06:24.842 --> 02:06:27.104]  And the other newscasts were pretty fair.
[02:06:27.564 --> 02:06:31.906]  So the fact is, and it got their attention when I bullhorned them and said, how dare you?
[02:06:32.387 --> 02:06:37.610]  You know, people don't understand when you kiss up to them and go along with it, it doesn't work.
[02:06:37.650 --> 02:06:40.512]  You've got to, when you're in the right, you got to say, you are wrong.
[02:06:40.952 --> 02:06:42.033]  And here's the facts.
[02:06:42.633 --> 02:06:44.274]  And so that's a great victory.
[02:06:44.639 --> 02:06:46.860]  Well it does take somebody calling them out on their actions.
[02:06:47.080 --> 02:06:47.661]  We have to.
[02:06:47.681 --> 02:06:52.903]  That's just like with this Rick Perry clip that hopefully we'll show in a little bit where I caught up with him at Red's Indoor Range.
[02:06:52.943 --> 02:06:58.286]  I got word of it Friday from Robert Morrow, a friend of mine, said Rick Perry's going to be at Red's Indoor Range on Friday afternoon.
[02:06:58.866 --> 02:07:00.867]  We went up there and a bunch of us showed up.
[02:07:00.907 --> 02:07:04.669]  It was a cadre of Patriots that were there and we waited two hours.
[02:07:04.689 --> 02:07:09.412]  I want to thank Val and Rita because Val is the one that shot the video himself and Rita was there as well, his wife.
[02:07:10.092 --> 02:07:23.362]  And we waited two hours to get that one minute of video because they wouldn't allow us inside the store to try to get this testimony out of Rick Perry to get his standing on where he stood on this gun show being closed down.
[02:07:23.702 --> 02:07:25.123]  So anyway, we waited there patiently.
[02:07:25.204 --> 02:07:26.084]  We finally got him.
[02:07:26.665 --> 02:07:29.026]  And as you saw, I only had less than a minute there.
[02:07:29.227 --> 02:07:29.707]  Got a minute!
[02:07:30.207 --> 02:07:40.457]  Right before he says I gotta go and not only that, his bodyguard or aide or whoever it was actually physically grabs him and pulls him away and I'm still there wanting to ask questions and continue the conversation.
[02:07:40.797 --> 02:07:42.018]  But at least we got him on record.
[02:07:42.058 --> 02:07:47.363]  My goal was to get him on record, say hey Rick Perry, where do you stand on this issue of the gun show being closed down?
[02:07:47.543 --> 02:07:57.565]  And he waffled it first, but at the end he said, no, my understanding is your understanding, Richard, that this was intimidation, that this was harassment, that this was a lot of things, and that they're looking into it.
[02:07:57.945 --> 02:08:07.626]  So now it is on record, because it's this illusion of the Austin Police Chief and the BATFE and the government saying, no, this is what we did, and that's our story, we're sticking to it.
[02:08:07.907 --> 02:08:09.527]  Now the governor's saying, hey, this is wrong.
[02:08:09.547 --> 02:08:13.127]  But I want to talk about who we hope our next governor's going to be, Deborah Medina, in a moment.
[02:08:13.147 --> 02:08:16.168]  But let's go ahead and play this Rick Perry clip.
[02:08:16.408 --> 02:08:16.769]  Right now.
[02:08:16.829 --> 02:08:18.050]  Here's the video and audio of that.
[02:08:18.070 --> 02:08:19.431]  This is Reds Indoor Range.
[02:08:19.491 --> 02:08:20.272]  Hi, I'm Richard.
[02:08:20.813 --> 02:08:23.936]  I had at least one more question about the gun show issue.
[02:08:23.956 --> 02:08:24.837]  Robert explained it earlier.
[02:08:24.877 --> 02:08:29.141]  My understanding is that the gun show owner has not voluntarily given up his gun show.
[02:08:29.161 --> 02:08:38.591]  What has happened, evidently, is a combination of APD and or BATFE has gone and talked to the landlord of the building, who is supposed to be HEB.
[02:08:39.432 --> 02:08:42.776]  And that HEB has come to the gun show and said, hey, your gun show is off.
[02:08:42.897 --> 02:08:43.357]  You're done.
[02:08:43.898 --> 02:08:49.645]  And my understanding is that the gun show has done nothing wrong, that they've been convicted over or anything like that.
[02:08:49.705 --> 02:08:50.787]  That's my understanding too.
[02:08:51.407 --> 02:08:53.090]  And my advice is find another venue.
[02:08:55.092 --> 02:08:55.412]  Sure.
[02:08:55.832 --> 02:08:58.654]  Is it okay that the Feds come in and pressure Atlanta like that?
[02:08:58.714 --> 02:08:59.835]  I don't think that's fine at all.
[02:08:59.875 --> 02:09:06.559]  My deal is though, until we get that all cleared up, because I mean there's a lot of he said she said here that I don't know what the facts are.
[02:09:06.759 --> 02:09:06.980]  Right.
[02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:21.009]  But if the issue is H-E-B won't let you have that site, I'll bet you there's somebody in this city that would dearly love to say, you know what, here's what, here's what, and then go forward and if they try it again, at that particular point in time,
[02:09:21.749 --> 02:09:27.133]  I'm not a lawyer, but I gotta start saying that harassment's getting into play here.
[02:09:29.055 --> 02:09:29.395]  Boom!
[02:09:29.415 --> 02:09:31.657]  So they drag him off.
[02:09:31.797 --> 02:09:32.178]  That's right.
[02:09:32.198 --> 02:09:34.640]  But definitely, this has drawn national attention.
[02:09:35.260 --> 02:09:39.023]  They've now admitted the Justice Department came in and told the Police Department to do this.
[02:09:39.043 --> 02:09:40.364]  They ran the last gun show off.
[02:09:40.404 --> 02:09:42.146]  They've now just shut this one down.
[02:09:42.746 --> 02:09:44.668]  And they've been caught telling different stories now.
[02:09:44.928 --> 02:09:46.750]  They're in a lot of trouble if people force the issue.
[02:09:47.210 --> 02:09:53.998]  Well, I look forward to our gun show in Austin being secured in perpetuity, you know, right here in Austin because of this event.
[02:09:54.058 --> 02:09:55.660]  I think we're really going to be victorious on that.
[02:09:56.061 --> 02:09:58.524]  We had the big rally yesterday that got the word out.
[02:09:58.564 --> 02:10:01.988]  You had the press reporting on it, 90% honest manner there.
[02:10:02.509 --> 02:10:03.590]  We've got Rick Perry here now.
[02:10:03.750 --> 02:10:04.251]  Think about this.
[02:10:04.791 --> 02:10:08.516]  It's a month and a week before a primary election here in Texas.
[02:10:08.816 --> 02:10:11.700]  The governor's race is a contested race regardless of what anybody says.
[02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:22.693]  Rick Perry, you'd think at least he'd be grandstanding on this gun show issue and say, oh yeah, I'm going to look into this, I'm going to take charge, we're going to see to it that the feds aren't down here interfering in our gun rights and our second amendment rights.
[02:10:23.314 --> 02:10:27.038]  He's so sold out that he doesn't even do that.
[02:10:27.058 --> 02:10:29.121]  You're a month and a week away from a primary.
[02:10:29.441 --> 02:10:40.253]  So imagine, folks, if he gets into the governorship once again and just continues on with the Bilderberg, New World Order, Agenda 21 agendas just moving forward in the police state.
[02:10:40.313 --> 02:10:44.418]  I mean, he's just going along right with every globalist program that they point our way.
[02:10:44.978 --> 02:10:46.639]  And he has definitely not stood up to the feds.
[02:10:46.699 --> 02:10:50.041]  He's definitely not stood up for states' rights, 10th Amendment rights.
[02:10:50.422 --> 02:10:51.042]  We've pressed him.
[02:10:51.082 --> 02:10:54.004]  We had a big nullification rally only a week before that.
[02:10:54.724 --> 02:11:01.048]  And at that nullification rally, we're asking Rick Perry to stand up for the states' rights, 10th Amendment rights.
[02:11:01.449 --> 02:11:02.429]  That's not happening either.
[02:11:02.509 --> 02:11:07.993]  And here we are, like I said, once again in a hotly contested Republican primary race for governor.
[02:11:08.453 --> 02:11:09.734]  And where is he on these issues?
[02:11:10.134 --> 02:11:10.554]  Silent.
[02:11:11.055 --> 02:11:12.876]  Well, here's the good news again, though.
[02:11:13.776 --> 02:11:30.783]  Debra Medina, unknown a few months ago, comes on this radio show, some other bigger radio shows, gets the Ron Paul movement behind her, Ron Paul died in the wool, in the fetter, and she goes into that debate and her numbers quadruple.
[02:11:31.183 --> 02:11:37.046]  She's now, if we had a few more months, she'd be guaranteed to win, but it's that race, but it sends a message.
[02:11:37.086 --> 02:11:41.108]  Whether she wins or loses, she wins, because now all these other candidates and governors,
[02:11:41.988 --> 02:11:42.708]  We're good to go.
[02:11:59.022 --> 02:12:06.126]  Paleo-conservative, constitutionalist, property rights, Second Amendment, national sovereignty, in the Fed, Debra Medina.
[02:12:07.126 --> 02:12:09.287]  I mean, this is sending shockwaves across the country.
[02:12:09.307 --> 02:12:10.788]  I've talked to national political pundits.
[02:12:10.808 --> 02:12:13.829]  They are following Debra Medina very, very closely.
[02:12:14.290 --> 02:12:16.651]  And so everybody else now is signing up to Ryan.
[02:12:16.851 --> 02:12:17.891]  And so we're going to get victories.
[02:12:17.931 --> 02:12:19.332]  Every time we stand up, we win.
[02:12:20.172 --> 02:12:22.714]  But they weren't going to put her in the next below debate.
[02:12:23.414 --> 02:12:29.519]  Even though she was tracking nicely, they changed the rules to say you have to be of a comparable office.
[02:12:29.559 --> 02:12:31.781]  You have to be a governor or a senator to be in a debate.
[02:12:32.141 --> 02:12:34.043]  That was obviously illegal, the way they changed.
[02:12:34.063 --> 02:12:36.925]  So they said, okay, because it's quasi-public-private.
[02:12:36.945 --> 02:12:40.128]  They say it's their private debate, but it's a public service they're supposedly carrying out.
[02:12:40.408 --> 02:12:43.150]  So their lawyers told them back off, and they did back off within a week.
[02:12:43.891 --> 02:12:44.632]  Tell us about Debra Medina.
[02:12:59.781 --> 02:13:03.546]  Well, the website Medina4Texas.com, I'd encourage everybody to go there, but here's the thing.
[02:13:04.508 --> 02:13:06.050]  I don't think Debra Medina can win.
[02:13:06.430 --> 02:13:07.972]  I don't believe Debra Medina can win.
[02:13:08.553 --> 02:13:11.297]  I know Debra Medina can win.
[02:13:11.317 --> 02:13:12.979]  I agree with you.
[02:13:13.260 --> 02:13:16.404]  If people don't like in the NFL, pick the team you think is going to win.
[02:13:16.564 --> 02:13:16.964]  That's right.
[02:13:17.004 --> 02:13:19.226]  We need to get past that psychological mechanism.
[02:13:19.406 --> 02:13:24.969]  Well listen, my grandmother, I don't know if you heard me talk about it earlier, she doesn't really listen to the show very often.
[02:13:25.269 --> 02:13:25.830]  It upsets her.
[02:13:26.410 --> 02:13:30.133]  And my mother was driving her around, great grandmother to my kids.
[02:13:31.301 --> 02:13:35.684]  And she was taking her to physical therapy last week, and she was sharp as a tack.
[02:13:36.244 --> 02:13:39.206]  And my mother said, who are you going to vote for in the Republican primary?
[02:13:39.246 --> 02:13:39.966]  She's a Republican.
[02:13:40.566 --> 02:13:42.727]  And she said, oh, Medina.
[02:13:43.768 --> 02:13:45.629]  Because everybody loved her.
[02:13:45.669 --> 02:13:47.050]  Talk radio is on fire with her.
[02:13:47.290 --> 02:13:47.931]  That's what's happening.
[02:13:48.131 --> 02:13:51.934]  The best thing that happened to us is KERA trying to black her out of this debate.
[02:13:52.414 --> 02:14:03.303]  It lit the fire behind the grassroots, which is something we really needed to happen because, folks, we had 1.3 million voters in the 2006 election that voted independent.
[02:14:03.503 --> 02:14:04.084]  1.3 million voters.
[02:14:04.584 --> 02:14:09.769]  That cadre of folks right there is ready to vote out establishment candidates like Rick Perry.
[02:14:10.529 --> 02:14:12.030]  If those people come into this primary,
[02:14:12.771 --> 02:14:14.453]  They can win this race because guess what?
[02:14:14.534 --> 02:14:18.779]  Rick Perry only had 550,000 votes in the 06 primary.
[02:14:18.799 --> 02:14:21.002]  550,000 votes is all he had.
[02:14:21.363 --> 02:14:24.126]  He may very well split those votes with Kay Bailey Hutchison.
[02:14:24.167 --> 02:14:25.689]  Kay Bailout Hutchison.
[02:14:26.169 --> 02:14:28.512]  She will win if people come out and vote!
[02:14:29.133 --> 02:14:30.314]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:14:30.334 --> 02:14:33.015]  There's no doubt there'll be some election fraud, but it's not in every county.
[02:14:33.135 --> 02:14:38.618]  If we figuratively and literally just tap on our neighbor's shoulders and ask them, hey, at least are you registered to vote?
[02:14:38.718 --> 02:14:41.420]  And tell them about Debra Medina, get a button, go on the website.
[02:14:41.460 --> 02:14:45.642]  The importance of that button right there, Alex, I can't tell you every day people ask me about that.
[02:14:45.682 --> 02:14:46.442]  Who's Debra Medina?
[02:14:46.802 --> 02:14:48.383]  And they want to know, they want to hear about it.
[02:14:48.803 --> 02:14:53.066]  I'm convinced that after the 06 election with 1.3 million independent voters,
[02:14:53.706 --> 02:14:56.246]  We had the Ron Paul Revolution occur in 07-08.
[02:14:56.787 --> 02:15:04.768]  I believe, in my heart, there are 2 million people in Texas that are ready to press that electronic fraud button for Debra Medina and make it work, though.
[02:15:05.088 --> 02:15:06.028]  Make that button work.
[02:15:06.388 --> 02:15:07.749]  Get your precincts out there.
[02:15:07.789 --> 02:15:09.129]  Get your precinct conventions going.
[02:15:09.169 --> 02:15:11.089]  Become precinct chairs.
[02:15:11.349 --> 02:15:19.991]  Regardless, we win because with a strong showing, and she may win, with a strong showing, you now have it moving to the states, which is the real battle plan to beat the New World Order.
[02:15:20.331 --> 02:15:22.331]  The Feds have been seized by offshore banks.
[02:15:22.792 --> 02:15:24.072]  We take the states back.
[02:15:24.412 --> 02:15:24.772]  It's over.
[02:15:25.312 --> 02:15:25.792]  That's right.
[02:15:25.852 --> 02:15:27.032]  And Texas can lead the way.
[02:15:27.673 --> 02:15:29.853]  It's just like Copenhagen when people said we couldn't beat it.
[02:15:29.993 --> 02:15:33.594]  If you just have the will to win and you've got the truth on your side, you can't be stopped.
[02:15:33.934 --> 02:15:40.335]  Alex, right here, this highway that goes by your office, I'm encouraged every time I come by here because I fought the tolls on this road.
[02:15:40.355 --> 02:15:42.076]  This was supposed to be a toll road by your office.
[02:15:42.096 --> 02:15:42.656]  Did you know that?
[02:15:42.776 --> 02:15:43.236]  Yes, I knew that.
[02:15:44.096 --> 02:15:47.260]  It was great activists here in the Austin area that fought that.
[02:15:47.280 --> 02:15:48.160]  That's one of the victories.
[02:15:48.221 --> 02:15:53.186]  Every time I have the pleasure of driving by your office, I think, you know what, we saved that from being a toll road.
[02:15:53.266 --> 02:15:54.888]  Alex doesn't have to pay a toll on account of it.
[02:15:55.228 --> 02:15:57.811]  So we were told back then, it's a done deal.
[02:15:58.151 --> 02:15:59.292]  There's no way to change it.
[02:15:59.613 --> 02:16:00.233]  Just give up.
[02:16:00.413 --> 02:16:01.134]  Just give up the battle.
[02:16:01.154 --> 02:16:01.795]  It's like health care.
[02:16:01.835 --> 02:16:02.556]  It's a done deal.
[02:16:02.776 --> 02:16:02.996]  Exactly.
[02:16:03.016 --> 02:16:03.677]  It's not a done deal.
[02:16:03.817 --> 02:16:05.377]  That's the classic play that they do.
[02:16:05.437 --> 02:16:06.198]  It's the board.
[02:16:06.238 --> 02:16:07.258]  You will be assimilated.
[02:16:07.278 --> 02:16:08.118]  You will be assimilated.
[02:16:08.418 --> 02:16:14.160]  And I'm here to tell you folks, Debra Medina can win this race, will win this race, if the people of Texas just do their job.
[02:16:14.440 --> 02:16:17.521]  I mean, think about it, Alex, you've been on the air 14 plus years, right?
[02:16:17.601 --> 02:16:17.841]  Yeah.
[02:16:18.261 --> 02:16:21.242]  Don't tell me there's not a half a million of us here in Texas.
[02:16:21.562 --> 02:16:23.242]  Half a million gets us in a runoff.
[02:16:23.742 --> 02:16:28.724]  If we get 700,000 or a million voters to vote Debra Medina in this race, then Debra Medina
[02:16:29.344 --> 02:16:29.984]  Will win this primary.
[02:16:30.004 --> 02:16:33.865]  And you're not even hearing about Democrats, so if she wins this, she's going to beat the Democrats.
[02:16:33.945 --> 02:16:34.986]  This is a Republican state.
[02:16:35.046 --> 02:16:35.486]  She will.
[02:16:35.526 --> 02:16:35.906]  That's right.
[02:16:35.946 --> 02:16:36.846]  This is a Republican state.
[02:16:36.886 --> 02:16:37.486]  And guess what?
[02:16:37.786 --> 02:16:39.787]  The flip side is true as well.
[02:16:40.087 --> 02:16:46.849]  If Rick Perry squirrels in to this primary victory, or Kay Bailout squirrels in, then the Democrat most likely is going to win.
[02:16:47.069 --> 02:16:54.851]  What we may see is a bifurcation of the vote in the general election in 2010, where Republican seats, you know, House seats,
[02:16:54.991 --> 02:16:56.592]  Because people are rebelling against incumbents.
[02:16:56.912 --> 02:16:58.472]  Massachusetts, they want the Democrats out.
[02:16:58.512 --> 02:17:00.993]  In Texas, they want the mainline Republicans out.
[02:17:13.157 --> 02:17:13.578]  That's right.
[02:17:13.878 --> 02:17:16.502]  Their rebellion against incumbents is exactly right.
[02:17:16.802 --> 02:17:20.648]  And see, it's like we've got an organic Ron Paul revolution going on within us.
[02:17:20.688 --> 02:17:24.293]  We've got Stephen Shopey running against Lamar Smith.
[02:17:24.713 --> 02:17:27.798]  We've got Joe Patronus here in Texas running against Michael McCaul.
[02:17:27.818 --> 02:17:29.080]  Why did Ron Paul endorse Smith?
[02:17:29.460 --> 02:17:34.063]  Well, I have pretty good information that he didn't know about Steven Shobby filing.
[02:17:34.543 --> 02:17:37.064]  Steven Shobby didn't file until the very last day of filing.
[02:17:37.464 --> 02:17:40.106]  Ron Paul, in my view, was most likely unaware.
[02:17:40.126 --> 02:17:41.246]  So it was the lesser of two evils.
[02:17:41.266 --> 02:17:41.967]  That's all it was.
[02:17:42.127 --> 02:17:45.749]  He was unaware about it, and I'm sure that there's some sorrow there.
[02:17:46.049 --> 02:17:46.709]  Stay there.
[02:17:46.729 --> 02:17:47.330]  We've got a break.
[02:17:47.390 --> 02:17:48.470]  Final segment straight ahead.
[02:17:49.051 --> 02:17:50.751]  Give people that website one more time for Debra Medina.
[02:17:51.152 --> 02:17:52.793]  Medina4Texas.com.
[02:17:53.093 --> 02:17:54.253]  Medina4Texas.com.
[02:17:54.593 --> 02:17:54.994]  Donate.
[02:17:55.154 --> 02:17:55.714]  Get a button.
[02:17:55.734 --> 02:17:56.474]  Get a yard sign.
[02:17:56.495 --> 02:17:56.855]  We'll be back.
[02:17:58.581 --> 02:17:59.141]  Hi, neighbor.
[02:17:59.161 --> 02:18:04.943]  No matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply, every single one of us who have prepared will have two regrets.
[02:18:05.583 --> 02:18:11.345]  Even those who haven't wasted a single penny on Christmas, birthdays, and vacations in order to store all the food possible.
[02:18:12.085 --> 02:18:15.346]  Even those who have sold stuff and taken on part-time jobs to buy food.
[02:18:15.986 --> 02:18:19.267]  Even those who have traded their gold while it will still buy food.
[02:18:19.887 --> 02:18:23.248]  Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy, and foolish.
[02:18:23.849 --> 02:18:28.310]  When folks won't be able to afford food, and there won't be any food for any amount of money.
[02:18:29.091 --> 02:18:31.052]  We will still have two regrets.
[02:18:31.713 --> 02:18:35.055]  We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food sooner.
[02:18:35.735 --> 02:18:38.617]  We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food.
[02:18:39.397 --> 02:18:44.841]  Putting off emergency food preparations will be the most dangerous decision that some of us will ever make.
[02:18:44.861 --> 02:18:47.062]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com 800-409-5633
[02:18:59.088 --> 02:19:02.718]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:19:03.139 --> 02:19:06.127]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:19:06.368 --> 02:19:07.791]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:19:08.487 --> 02:19:11.128]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:19:11.148 --> 02:19:17.349]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:19:17.549 --> 02:19:22.590]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:19:22.731 --> 02:19:32.713]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:19:32.833 --> 02:19:34.954]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:19:35.194 --> 02:19:36.514]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:19:36.774 --> 02:19:39.055]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:19:39.235 --> 02:19:41.076]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:19:41.096 --> 02:19:46.138]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:19:46.498 --> 02:19:55.621]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:19:57.941 --> 02:19:59.502]  You may be new to freeze-dry foods.
[02:19:59.722 --> 02:20:01.322]  You may have storable food questions.
[02:20:01.562 --> 02:20:06.104]  You may want to buy your freeze-dried foods from a very reputable company and not go broke in the process.
[02:20:06.404 --> 02:20:07.985]  Welcome to the freeze-dry guy.
[02:20:08.005 --> 02:20:10.506]  Okay, actually, we're more than just one guy.
[02:20:10.606 --> 02:20:13.427]  We're a California-based company that's been serving our U.S.
[02:20:13.467 --> 02:20:19.190]  military and other government agencies with the finest in freeze-dried storable foods and emergency rations since 1970.
[02:20:20.430 --> 02:20:22.813]  See all about us at freeze dry guy dot com.
[02:20:22.973 --> 02:20:29.000]  With freeze dry guy freeze dried foods, you can and will be ready for just about any unexpected crisis.
[02:20:29.260 --> 02:20:36.189]  Freeze dry guy foods are delicious, require little preparation and will taste just as fresh decades from now as they do today.
[02:20:36.349 --> 02:20:37.770]  Just add hot water and serve.
[02:20:37.971 --> 02:20:40.794]  Backpackers consistently write us number one year after year
[02:20:40.794 --> 02:20:41.854]  The other good news is Deborah Medina.
[02:20:41.894 --> 02:20:42.435]  I've talked to her.
[02:20:42.455 --> 02:20:43.475]  She's coming on Thursday.
[02:21:06.289 --> 02:21:09.771]  She is swamped from 6 in the morning until 11 at night.
[02:21:10.171 --> 02:21:15.875]  She is doing interview after interview after interview after interview after interview on talk radio, newspapers, and TV.
[02:21:16.495 --> 02:21:20.257]  I mean, she is the hottest thing since, you know, Corvettes and blondes.
[02:21:20.297 --> 02:21:24.460]  I mean, it is super, super hot what's going on.
[02:21:24.480 --> 02:21:26.861]  And again, it shows that fervor.
[02:21:27.301 --> 02:21:31.844]  The other big problem is, and she has raised, what, $300-something thousand dollars?
[02:21:33.137 --> 02:21:36.098]  Right, which for a statewide campaign here in Texas, that's nothing.
[02:21:36.118 --> 02:21:38.659]  You've got Rick Perry and Kay Bailey each having millions of dollars.
[02:21:39.159 --> 02:21:42.860]  But still, for a new Dark Horse candidate out of the middle of nowhere, that is big.
[02:21:43.620 --> 02:21:53.002]  Now expanding on that, you are worried as I am about Glenn Beck, about Sarah Palin, their clear positioning of her as a spoiler in 2012.
[02:21:53.143 --> 02:21:53.783]  Explain that.
[02:21:55.003 --> 02:21:55.383]  That's right.
[02:21:55.403 --> 02:21:59.666]  Well, folks, the New World Order is positioning Sarah Palin as a presidential candidate for 2012.
[02:21:59.946 --> 02:22:01.187]  There's no doubt about that.
[02:22:01.627 --> 02:22:03.028]  And right now, she's a rhino.
[02:22:03.088 --> 02:22:05.529]  She's just a product of the New World Order propaganda.
[02:22:05.889 --> 02:22:07.470]  But there's a chance she may become patriot.
[02:22:07.510 --> 02:22:07.850]  Who knows?
[02:22:07.890 --> 02:22:11.453]  But I want to ask the Info Warriors out there in the Tennessee area.
[02:22:11.893 --> 02:22:18.677]  Palin is supposed to be at a Tea Party convention, a national Tea Party convention, next weekend, the first weekend of February.
[02:22:19.077 --> 02:22:22.239]  I'd like for folks to get over there and call her out and say, look, Sarah Palin,
[02:22:22.759 --> 02:22:24.580]  You're going to come to Texas and endorse Rick Perry.
[02:22:24.640 --> 02:22:25.701]  You need to stop that.
[02:22:25.781 --> 02:22:35.846]  You need to not come to Texas, not do the photo ops with Rick Perry, not do a big press endorsement of Rick Perry, because your rogueness, at that point Sarah Palin, your rogueness is over.
[02:22:36.286 --> 02:22:42.669]  There are going to be patriots nationwide saying, look Sarah Palin, we know you are not rogue, and stop.
[02:22:42.749 --> 02:22:43.649]  Don't come down to Texas.
[02:22:45.030 --> 02:22:46.711]  Perry, he says he's got new jobs.
[02:22:46.731 --> 02:22:47.752]  They're all government jobs.
[02:22:47.772 --> 02:22:49.953]  We lost jobs in the private sector.
[02:22:50.313 --> 02:22:51.654]  Perry goes to Bilderberg.
[02:22:51.834 --> 02:22:53.695]  Kay Bailey Hutchinson is a steering committee member.
[02:22:53.715 --> 02:22:55.756]  I mean, that's highest level globalist.
[02:22:56.897 --> 02:23:05.482]  I mean, Perry vetoed, until the heat got on him, the legislature banning all the toll roads.
[02:23:06.164 --> 02:23:06.605]  Oh, I know.
[02:23:06.845 --> 02:23:09.047]  Rick Perry is still pushing the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[02:23:09.087 --> 02:23:10.068]  He's still pushing NAFTA.
[02:23:10.108 --> 02:23:13.531]  He's still pushing all these globalist agendas, albeit more quietly.
[02:23:13.832 --> 02:23:17.175]  But you know how you can really find out where Rick Perry stands are by his appointments.
[02:23:17.535 --> 02:23:25.724]  He appointed Ted Houghton, the one sole holdout vote that voted pro-Sintra on SH-121 up in Dallas-Fort Worth area.
[02:23:26.104 --> 02:23:26.885]  Ted Houghton was adopted.
[02:23:26.905 --> 02:23:27.405]  But that's okay.
[02:23:27.505 --> 02:23:30.048]  Sintra isn't owned by Spain because Lewis Black of the Chronicle says so.
[02:23:30.128 --> 02:23:30.708]  Well, there you go.
[02:23:30.728 --> 02:23:35.412]  So, I mean, if you look at the appointments that Rick Perry makes, then you'll know where he really stands.
[02:23:35.712 --> 02:23:37.213]  And that's what I recommend that people do.
[02:23:37.273 --> 02:23:41.876]  And Ted Houghton was a pro-Sentra vote back in summer of 07 on SH-121.
[02:23:42.216 --> 02:23:45.298]  Now, he's the chairman of the Texas Transportation Commission.
[02:23:45.818 --> 02:23:54.524]  And Rick Perry hand-picked Ted Houghton as Rick Williamson's replacement when Rick Williamson passed away to sit on this Texas Transportation Commission.
[02:23:54.844 --> 02:23:57.506]  So, that tells you right there a lot of what you need to know about Rick Perry.
[02:23:57.546 --> 02:24:00.108]  So, if Rick Perry has his way, he'd like to toll every
[02:24:00.388 --> 02:24:02.891]  He's presided over the new franchise tax.
[02:24:02.951 --> 02:24:04.453]  It's really an income tax.
[02:24:04.693 --> 02:24:05.134]  You name it.
[02:24:05.154 --> 02:24:15.145]  Well, we can talk about the Gardasil thing that he tried to do, slamming, trying to get all the girls here in Texas injected with this HPV vaccine that was a fraud and the eugenics implications behind that.
[02:24:15.185 --> 02:24:18.068]  But he's got nice hair and talks like a country boy.
[02:24:18.328 --> 02:24:19.209]  That's right, that's right.
[02:24:19.249 --> 02:24:21.451]  Well, I tell you what, let's send him to the private sector.
[02:24:21.791 --> 02:24:32.360]  Deborah Medina not only has a possibility to win, she can win and she will win if we just get up and get out there and get at the voting booth and donate some money to her campaign.
[02:24:32.380 --> 02:24:34.021]  Well, she's on the show Thursday.
[02:24:34.041 --> 02:24:34.442]  Awesome.
[02:24:34.602 --> 02:24:41.087]  Right before the debate Friday and she's on in the last hour so we look forward to that just like you were here with us today Richard Reeves.
[02:24:41.428 --> 02:24:42.849]  Give her website out again one more time.
[02:24:43.109 --> 02:24:52.216]  Medina4Texas.com, Medina4Texas.com folks, donate, get a button right here, a lapel button, get signs in your yard, and let's win this election.
[02:24:52.236 --> 02:24:53.477]  Let's send Rick Perry home.
[02:24:53.757 --> 02:24:55.259]  Let's not even go through a runoff.
