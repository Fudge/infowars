[00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:09.128]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:10.609]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.290]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.931 --> 00:00:16.593]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.113 --> 00:00:21.215]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.417 --> 00:00:25.858]  We're live, my friends.
[00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:26.799]  It is October 1st, 2010.
[00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:45.380]  We've got the health ranger up here from war-torn Ecuador, expert on health issues, GMO, the pharmacological garbage being pushed on us.
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:56.748]  He'll be joining us in studio today and Bob Chapman is going to give us his weekly visit an hour early in the second hour he's normally on, in the third hour, obviously a lot to talk about with him.
[00:00:58.154 --> 00:01:00.781]  Boy, just look at all these stacks of news in front of me.
[00:01:01.752 --> 00:01:08.315]  You know, I started printing these out about a week ago, and I've never gotten to it, but I do want to spend some time on this today.
[00:01:09.575 --> 00:01:10.816]  This is from CNET News.
[00:01:10.916 --> 00:01:12.116]  Sci-fi wars.
[00:01:12.636 --> 00:01:15.458]  Pilots say UFOs knocked out nukes.
[00:01:15.738 --> 00:01:25.802]  And they've been testifying about this, working at nuclear bases and Air Force bases, and aliens turning off their nuclear weapons.
[00:01:25.942 --> 00:01:30.304]  And there's so much mainstream media now saying aliens are real.
[00:01:31.064 --> 00:01:32.946]  In fact, of course, you saw this a few months ago.
[00:01:33.086 --> 00:01:33.947]  UFO files.
[00:01:33.987 --> 00:01:39.754]  Winston Churchill feared panic over second World War RAF incident.
[00:01:41.696 --> 00:01:42.417]  Here's another one.
[00:01:42.477 --> 00:01:48.020]  Churchill and Eisenhower agreed to cover up RAF planes UFO encounter during World War II.
[00:01:48.401 --> 00:01:49.622]  Secret files reveal.
[00:01:50.202 --> 00:01:51.003]  That's the mail.
[00:01:51.063 --> 00:01:51.863]  Here's the telegraph.
[00:01:51.883 --> 00:01:53.484]  I mean, this is mainstream news.
[00:01:53.985 --> 00:01:55.646]  Remember all those old-timers?
[00:01:56.767 --> 00:01:58.588]  Different people that had been in the military?
[00:01:59.128 --> 00:02:02.851]  Colonels and others saying that Eisenhower secretly met with space aliens?
[00:02:03.591 --> 00:02:06.934]  Yeah, I don't cover space aliens on this radio show.
[00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:33.754]  If I can't get people to wake up to the fact that we have official UN and Rockefeller Foundation and other major foundation documents that we show you, we link to on their websites, they're proud of it, admitting they're adding different compounds to vaccines to give you cancer and reduce your fertility, then how would I get into aliens, something we can't prove one way or the other?
[00:02:33.774 --> 00:02:36.155]  I mean, if I can't get
[00:02:37.225 --> 00:02:46.290]  Some people out there to care about depleted uranium, which they're using all over the world now, that is completely radioactive and deadly poison.
[00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.691]  Why talk about little green men?
[00:02:49.111 --> 00:02:53.553]  And look, I'm not criticizing people that do cover little green men.
[00:02:55.274 --> 00:03:06.320]  I mean, I understand it's very interesting and we're out here on a planet spinning through the galaxy, but my bigger issue is why is the media, after decades of
[00:03:07.267 --> 00:03:14.369]  pooh-poohing all of this and making fun of people that discuss it and kind of shelving it, you know, into the absurdist realm.
[00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.270]  Why are they now giving it so much validity?
[00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.971]  We've seen this drumbeat increasing in the last five, six years.
[00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:33.875]  You know, Larry King Live with giant UFOs over Dallas and ABC News pointing cameras at what are clearly Homeland Security blimps, even have propellers on them, saying, is it aliens at a hundred thousand feet over Salt Lake City?
[00:03:33.915 --> 00:03:36.456]  And we've played those videos and it's a stinking blimp!
[00:03:37.176 --> 00:03:40.377]  I mean, the media knows it's not a giant alien spacecraft.
[00:03:40.437 --> 00:03:45.238]  It's not District 9 or whatever, and they're playing along with it.
[00:03:45.258 --> 00:03:47.198]  Well, we know it's part of Project Blue Beam.
[00:03:47.938 --> 00:03:57.520]  There's a whole chapter on this in Paul Watson's book, Order Out of Chaos, elite-sponsored terror in the New World Order, and a fake alien invasion, that is a psychological form of terror.
[00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:06.982]  So we know the government has been looking and has declassified giant hologram projectors they've got for 3,000-foot Jesus or Buddha or Muhammad or
[00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:07.823]  We're good.
[00:04:27.865 --> 00:04:30.006]  Yesterday, we were all nationalists.
[00:04:30.026 --> 00:04:33.108]  We were Americans, Russians, Japanese, Mexicans.
[00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:37.671]  Today, we are Earthlings, united against the menace.
[00:04:38.091 --> 00:04:39.472]  Are the aliens friendly?
[00:04:39.712 --> 00:04:40.992]  What planet do they come from?
[00:04:41.733 --> 00:04:45.155]  Tonight, at 7, we'll be interviewing the alien ambassador.
[00:04:46.291 --> 00:04:47.051]  Come on, folks.
[00:04:47.552 --> 00:04:47.792]  Come on.
[00:04:48.092 --> 00:04:49.632]  You can see them scripting this.
[00:04:50.353 --> 00:04:54.555]  So I'll talk some about that, but first I want to get into all the other news, and we've got a bunch of guests coming up today.
[00:04:54.575 --> 00:04:55.515]  It's going to be very informative.
[00:04:56.075 --> 00:04:58.356]  The economy, obviously, is falling apart in front of everyone right now.
[00:05:00.937 --> 00:05:15.364]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:05:16.403 --> 00:05:20.104]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:21.085 --> 00:05:33.089]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:41.112]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:05:41.812 --> 00:05:51.404]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:55.470]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.234]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[00:05:59.795 --> 00:06:04.037]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:04.357 --> 00:06:04.977]  Number one.
[00:06:05.278 --> 00:06:08.419]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:09.259]  Number two.
[00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:14.102]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:14.442 --> 00:06:14.882]  It's true.
[00:06:15.182 --> 00:06:19.744]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:20.064 --> 00:06:20.605]  Number three.
[00:06:20.885 --> 00:06:24.166]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:24.466 --> 00:06:28.168]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:28.368 --> 00:06:28.909]  Number 4.
[00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:31.531]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:31.931 --> 00:06:35.314]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:35.614 --> 00:06:35.815]  Number 5.
[00:06:36.395 --> 00:06:40.318]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:45.303]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:45.583 --> 00:06:49.626]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:49.766 --> 00:06:51.327]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:51.548 --> 00:06:53.649]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:56.391]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:06:56.411 --> 00:07:00.294]  Listen up, friends.
[00:07:00.334 --> 00:07:02.296]  This is Alex Jones with key information.
[00:07:02.676 --> 00:07:06.199]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:09.081]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[00:07:09.341 --> 00:07:14.344]  You need to get your own supply of high-quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[00:07:14.725 --> 00:07:20.389]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.
[00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:26.012]  It's all fresh, made on a monthly basis, not some old cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[00:07:26.332 --> 00:07:30.615]  Try their new evacuation pack, a two-week supply of delicious, easy-to-fix food.
[00:07:30.876 --> 00:07:38.981]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it, with open talk of a strike on Iran in the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.
[00:07:39.341 --> 00:07:41.182]  Get yourself and your family ready today.
[00:07:41.542 --> 00:07:43.603]  The place to go is efoodsdirect.com.
[00:07:43.923 --> 00:07:51.406]  Go to their website online right now, efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex, or call 800-409-5633.
[00:07:51.766 --> 00:07:56.788]  Again, on the web, efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex, or give them a call at 800-409-5633.
[00:08:04.429 --> 00:08:10.683]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:17.848 --> 00:08:21.811]  It is the first day of October on this Friday edition, 2010.
[00:08:21.851 --> 00:08:33.958]  Bob Chapman on the economy in the next hour, then the health ranger, all the way from war-torn, coup-torn, junta-torn Ecuador will be joining us in studio today.
[00:08:33.978 --> 00:08:36.600]  We'll probably go into overdrive into the fourth hour.
[00:08:37.421 --> 00:08:39.162]  Okay, here are the stacks of news.
[00:08:39.682 --> 00:08:42.384]  Millions of computers hit by virus across China.
[00:08:45.205 --> 00:08:55.420]  Computer worm attacking Iran's nuclear facilities includes biblical link to China and it's the same one now hitting China.
[00:08:58.157 --> 00:09:01.138]  Again, millions of computers hit by virus across China.
[00:09:01.979 --> 00:09:05.000]  That is the headline out of the Jakarta Globe.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.661]  Here's the Mail Online.
[00:09:06.701 --> 00:09:11.663]  Computer worm attacking Iran's nuclear facilities includes biblical link to Israel.
[00:09:11.763 --> 00:09:12.923]  I misspoke when I said China.
[00:09:13.263 --> 00:09:16.785]  It's now spread to China and is hitting China as well.
[00:09:17.405 --> 00:09:19.826]  And we played clips of course earlier this week.
[00:09:20.206 --> 00:09:25.070]  Where mainstream media, Bloomberg, AP, Reuters, they're all just admitting it.
[00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:37.819]  Okay, Israel designed this super worm to take down infrastructures, and it's super high-tech, and spies have got to go inside the facilities to load this on to the industrial computer systems.
[00:09:38.619 --> 00:09:41.662]  But as we predicted, it's now all over the mainstream media.
[00:09:41.702 --> 00:09:42.682]  We're going to go over some of that.
[00:09:43.463 --> 00:09:48.246]  Where they're saying, see, we've got to pass cyber security right now.
[00:09:49.247 --> 00:09:53.929]  Or we could be hit by something like the Stuxnet computer worm.
[00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:55.730]  You gotta love it.
[00:09:56.290 --> 00:10:01.152]  A western government clearly designs and launches this.
[00:10:01.773 --> 00:10:13.498]  It's attacking the globalist enemies, at least at one level, the Iranians, the Chinese, the Indonesians, clearly loaded onto their systems by spies that went in at
[00:10:14.636 --> 00:10:16.158]  The Zero Point of Origin.
[00:10:27.253 --> 00:10:39.420]  By the general public, or at least the government thinks that, they come out in the media and say, see, we need to surveil the internet and control the internet and have more choke points put into the internet to be able to shut off the internet.
[00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:40.160]  That's their quote.
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:44.843]  Obama and Hayden and all of them are all over the news, LA Times this week.
[00:10:45.143 --> 00:10:50.726]  We need the power to shut the web off to protect it when they are the ones that will attack the internet.
[00:10:51.266 --> 00:11:03.271]  In fact, that was a Pentagon press release three days ago that they're running a giant drill right now of, quote, attacking their own system so they can prevent and understand attacks in the future.
[00:11:03.331 --> 00:11:13.155]  No, they're practicing killing parts of the Internet and shutting off industrial systems when they want to, and then blaming it on shadowy men in caves.
[00:11:13.915 --> 00:11:21.886]  It's always the globalists in every case that are launching these sophisticated physical terror attacks, cyber terror attacks, you name it.
[00:11:21.906 --> 00:11:23.628]  So that's all in plain view.
[00:11:23.668 --> 00:11:26.251]  We're going to be going more over that today.
[00:11:27.489 --> 00:11:31.253]  In the economic stack, global employment crisis will stir.
[00:11:31.333 --> 00:11:33.395]  Social unrest warns U.N.
[00:11:33.575 --> 00:11:34.116]  agency.
[00:11:34.136 --> 00:11:43.745]  And of course, we had the Pentagon come out two weeks ago and say that they're worried about a total collapse and society degenerating, but they've got a solution.
[00:11:44.486 --> 00:11:45.527]  Martial law.
[00:11:45.627 --> 00:11:50.051]  That will save you from the financial crisis that the banksters have engineered.
[00:11:51.141 --> 00:12:02.808]  Just like this year the Federal Reserve got more power over the markets and private companies and the ability to track all your purchases to fix the problem they admittedly engineered to enrich themselves.
[00:12:03.028 --> 00:12:03.908]  You've just got to love it.
[00:12:04.488 --> 00:12:13.614]  So unemployment exploding worldwide and riots all over Europe as people are having their taxes raised and part of their pension funds stolen.
[00:12:14.534 --> 00:12:18.515]  But this is part of the IMF World Bank plan that got leaked in 2002.
[00:12:18.815 --> 00:12:27.858]  They talked about, well, we've robbed the third world, the developing world, now we're going to rob Europe, the United States, Australia, and all of the supposed wealthy nations and steal their wealth.
[00:12:27.898 --> 00:12:37.421]  And the great part is, they call it the IMF riot, when the people then riot, that will drive down confidence even more and
[00:12:38.886 --> 00:12:43.389]  It's an even bigger fire sale for the banks, flush with cash from bailouts.
[00:12:43.769 --> 00:12:45.750]  They can now move in and buy everything up.
[00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:48.752]  So it's working like a charm, of course.
[00:12:48.772 --> 00:12:52.293]  The general public is still more concerned about Survivor.
[00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:57.576]  Did Jimmy Johnson get kicked off the show?
[00:12:57.716 --> 00:13:01.278]  Or does Howard Stern have bedbugs at his office?
[00:13:01.839 --> 00:13:03.460]  Yes, that's what's important.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.581]  And so we're going to be enslaved.
[00:13:06.809 --> 00:13:14.494]  But again, some people are waking up, but the problem is the neocons are now posing as patriots to be pied pipers to lead that movement down a rat hole.
[00:13:15.254 --> 00:13:17.735]  But people are getting more and more wise to these scams.
[00:13:18.096 --> 00:13:24.840]  Flames of anger strikes fury over spending cuts sweeps Europe.
[00:13:26.341 --> 00:13:33.185]  So flames of anger strike fury over spending cuts as it sweeps Europe.
[00:13:34.165 --> 00:13:37.266]  And Bob Chapman's got a detailed report up at Infowars.com today.
[00:13:37.606 --> 00:13:39.927]  The risk of currency devaluation.
[00:13:41.868 --> 00:13:43.128]  Currency devaluation.
[00:13:43.348 --> 00:13:44.229]  That's already begun.
[00:13:44.249 --> 00:13:46.469]  It's been going on for a while.
[00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:53.932]  But the dollar's lost 99% of its purchasing value since 1913 when the Federal Reserve took over.
[00:13:56.681 --> 00:14:07.129]  And they inflate the currency for themselves at the top of the pyramid and buy things with it and then pass on the devaluation to you and make you pay it back also in taxes.
[00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:10.511]  So we'll be talking to Bob Chapman about that.
[00:14:10.972 --> 00:14:15.055]  Two years and billions later, bank bailout program finally ends.
[00:14:16.175 --> 00:14:20.879]  That's the AP headline, and Geithner says economy still needs reinforcement.
[00:14:20.899 --> 00:14:31.868]  That means more money to the banksters that they then don't pass on in loans to the public and industry that aren't part of the insider club.
[00:14:32.969 --> 00:14:40.294]  But Geithner, two weeks ago your office told us that the recession ended 15 months ago in June of 2009.
[00:14:43.601 --> 00:14:47.744]  So it ended 15 months ago, but you need more money.
[00:14:49.506 --> 00:14:51.227]  Also, this has to be a joke.
[00:14:51.507 --> 00:15:07.340]  SEC is about to blame entire flash crash on Waddell & Reid's E-Mini trades, which is a very small outfit overall in the aggregate, Zero Hedge, Tyler Durgan reports.
[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.903]  And sure enough, I have the Bloomberg article they're talking about.
[00:15:11.929 --> 00:15:16.754]  Report to say, Waddell stoked flash crash.
[00:15:17.915 --> 00:15:21.218]  That thousand point drop in 15 minutes that happened a few months ago?
[00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:33.491]  The SEC, that covered up for Bernie Madoff and others, and of course Kinlay as long as they could, all those insider groups, they are telling you that some little tiny group did it.
[00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:35.771]  Isn't that just special?
[00:15:36.152 --> 00:15:43.259]  So they want to restrict smaller firms from running their own computer programs so only the big boys like Goldman Sachs can siphon off the money.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:48.945]  Also, will the dollar rebound before dissolving into global currency?
[00:15:49.005 --> 00:15:53.150]  Excellent report from activist post Eric Blair up at InfoWars.com.
[00:15:54.462 --> 00:15:55.042]  And here's another one.
[00:15:55.322 --> 00:15:57.063]  Gold at record for six days.
[00:15:57.203 --> 00:15:57.523]  U.S.
[00:15:57.583 --> 00:15:58.703]  policy in focus.
[00:15:58.723 --> 00:16:00.143]  It hit $1,317 last time I checked.
[00:16:00.163 --> 00:16:00.423]  $17.10, I should add.
[00:16:00.443 --> 00:16:01.784]  So that's just some of the news on that front.
[00:16:19.372 --> 00:16:25.781]  I want to get into this coming up at the bottom of the hour after I cover some other important news.
[00:16:28.125 --> 00:16:34.033]  And that is Fox News boss calls for legalizing 40 million illegals.
[00:16:36.019 --> 00:16:41.244]  And of course, he also ordered all of his TV divisions to promote that man-made global warming is real.
[00:16:41.845 --> 00:16:47.910]  And we've shown you Fox TV promos promoting that global warming is real and carbon taxes are good.
[00:16:49.091 --> 00:16:54.016]  And if you criticize Rupert Murdoch, so-called conservatives send you hate-filled emails saying you're a liar.
[00:16:54.276 --> 00:16:56.659]  Okay, well, he's on TV promoting
[00:16:57.139 --> 00:16:59.141]  The legalization of 40 million illegal aliens.
[00:16:59.842 --> 00:17:01.644]  And you've got to love this doublespeak.
[00:17:01.664 --> 00:17:03.727]  Here's CNS News reporting on it.
[00:17:03.907 --> 00:17:07.331]  Rupert Murdoch calls for amnesty for law-abiding illegal immigrants.
[00:17:08.873 --> 00:17:13.438]  That's like... Rupert Murdoch calls for...
[00:17:15.834 --> 00:17:18.415]  Law-abiding child molesters to be released from prison.
[00:17:18.435 --> 00:17:19.236]  I mean, what does that mean?
[00:17:19.696 --> 00:17:22.458]  Rupert Murdoch calls for amnesty for law-abiding illegal immigrants.
[00:17:22.858 --> 00:17:26.000]  So a full court press by the neocons on that front.
[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.741]  Also, Texas Sheriff, Mexican bandits entered U.S.
[00:17:28.781 --> 00:17:29.162]  waters.
[00:17:29.902 --> 00:17:32.503]  Just the latest report of piracy on lakes in Texas.
[00:17:33.044 --> 00:17:34.685]  And it's also going on the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:17:35.065 --> 00:17:36.686]  There's just a massive increase.
[00:17:36.766 --> 00:17:37.666]  It's more than doubled.
[00:17:37.706 --> 00:17:39.708]  We've had captains on to report on this.
[00:17:42.609 --> 00:17:47.531]  Major international organizations like Interpol admit there's been more than a doubling exponentially in the last three years.
[00:17:48.272 --> 00:17:50.653]  Every year it's been exponentially doubling each year.
[00:17:51.053 --> 00:17:52.573]  And the Gulf of Mexico piracy.
[00:17:53.294 --> 00:17:57.716]  But local media doesn't tell you, hey, don't take your sailboat down into Mexican waters.
[00:17:58.016 --> 00:18:03.518]  You're going to get robbed by federales and they're going to kill you and your wife and kids and throw you overboard and then go sell your boat.
[00:18:03.538 --> 00:18:06.639]  Because that's who the pirates are in most cases.
[00:18:06.719 --> 00:18:07.540]  No, no, no, no.
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.121]  They're just going to send you right on down there to get killed.
[00:18:10.541 --> 00:18:13.423]  And then it's just, oh, where'd the Browns go?
[00:18:13.483 --> 00:18:15.644]  Or where'd the Changs go?
[00:18:15.664 --> 00:18:17.806]  Or where'd the Swartzes go?
[00:18:18.286 --> 00:18:19.207]  Oh, we don't know!
[00:18:19.227 --> 00:18:29.814]  You know, their sailboat showed up six months later, repainted with new serial numbers, but it got sold at an auction in Miami, but whoop-dee-doo, they're dead, you know.
[00:18:32.065 --> 00:18:44.396]  See, the globalists ignore all the real carnage that's going on, and then they hype up imaginary stuff, like, oh, you know, one guy shot himself at UT on Monday.
[00:18:44.416 --> 00:18:51.262]  Well, the Texas legislature better not legalize concealed carry on Texas campuses, which statistically
[00:18:52.203 --> 00:18:55.845]  All the evidence has shown over 20% reductions in crime on average.
[00:18:56.526 --> 00:18:56.986]  So what?
[00:18:57.226 --> 00:18:58.687]  So what if it actually makes us safer?
[00:18:59.467 --> 00:19:10.113]  We better cancel the speech by Professor John Lott at the UT Law School that night, conveniently, on the 28th, because after all, talking about guns could cause violence.
[00:19:11.033 --> 00:19:12.834]  Don't even talk about guns in America.
[00:19:13.575 --> 00:19:14.455]  So that's coming up.
[00:19:14.515 --> 00:19:17.097]  Now if you think that's insane tyranny,
[00:19:18.519 --> 00:19:18.819]  I don't
[00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:47.455]  How they just admit, yeah, we're listening to all your phone calls, reading all your email, everything you do, and they're having law enforcement seminars all over the country, and the federal government just plunked $153 million down on this.
[00:19:48.136 --> 00:19:49.756]  I saw that in the news this morning.
[00:19:51.037 --> 00:19:59.441]  To run everything you do through a database and give the local police access to it, I bet they'll have fun with that, and if you criticize the government, well, you're in deep trouble.
[00:20:01.906 --> 00:20:06.787]  The economy is crumbling, debt soaring, and the possibility of World War III is increasing.
[00:20:07.668 --> 00:20:18.851]  I started SurvivalistSeeds.com from my dining room table with a small bucket of seed and a single rotating banner ad on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:20:19.751 --> 00:20:27.293]  Two years later, we've sold over 40,000 pounds of heirloom seeds, becoming the largest bulk seed seller to the public.

[00:20:48.745 --> 00:20:50.566]  Don't wait until it's too late.
[00:20:51.466 --> 00:20:56.909]  I'm Vic John Lipscomb and my company is survivalistseeds.com.
[00:21:00.123 --> 00:21:04.586]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:23:04.055 --> 00:23:11.738]  Freezing or canning may have been the process you've used, but the good folks at Excalibur Dehydrator have a healthy alternative to preserve the fruits of your labor.

[00:24:10.595 --> 00:24:20.638]  Here's just a quick blurb on one of the main modes of banning and restricting free speech in Europe and in Canada, and they're trying to push this same model here.
[00:24:21.359 --> 00:24:26.941]  UK government passes law where anyone who claims to have been offended can sue.
[00:24:26.981 --> 00:24:33.963]  If you're just offended, even if you're not talking about somebody, but they don't like what you say and it's offensive to them, they can sue you.
[00:24:35.586 --> 00:24:37.508]  And we see this being introduced in public schools.
[00:24:37.568 --> 00:24:39.169]  Every day or two I see articles.
[00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:57.965]  In fact, I saw one last week where it's over a year later and this middle school student, who was an A-plus student, is still suspended in the school district, expelled completely, because they brought a one-inch toy gun with their G.I.
[00:24:58.025 --> 00:24:59.887]  Joe action figure to school.
[00:25:00.207 --> 00:25:00.687]  Remember that?
[00:25:01.491 --> 00:25:04.613]  Still suspended, expelled a year later.
[00:25:05.053 --> 00:25:06.394]  It's a thought crime.
[00:25:07.035 --> 00:25:07.995]  It's offensive.
[00:25:08.115 --> 00:25:08.996]  It's scary.
[00:25:09.336 --> 00:25:19.903]  We've got to have the UT Law School ban and cancel the speech of Professor John Lott talking about more guns, less crime, which is a statistical fact.
[00:25:19.983 --> 00:25:20.324]  There it is.
[00:25:20.564 --> 00:25:23.586]  Child still expelled for toy gun a year later.
[00:25:24.987 --> 00:25:26.608]  Parents want their child back in school.
[00:25:26.648 --> 00:25:28.729]  School board says, no way, Jose.
[00:25:31.874 --> 00:25:36.937]  There is the headline on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:25:37.737 --> 00:25:42.140]  I want to get into Fox News boss Murdoch calls for legalizing 40 million illegals.
[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:45.041]  Feds use pre-crime to target disgruntled veterans.
[00:25:45.862 --> 00:25:54.006]  As we continue to just point out to anybody joining the military, anybody in the military, that you are hated and surveilled by this government.
[00:25:56.607 --> 00:26:03.296]  Almost all of their spying and surveillance is targeting gun owners, landowners, conservatives, libertarians.
[00:26:04.684 --> 00:26:06.545]  But of all those groups, veterans.
[00:26:07.605 --> 00:26:10.946]  And I want to go over Paul Watson's article on this because it's excellent.
[00:26:11.666 --> 00:26:14.507]  And we want to get this story out to everyone who's in the military.
[00:26:14.847 --> 00:26:27.431]  Also, we posted up on the YouTube Alex Jones channel the interview we did with Dr. Doug Rocky yesterday, the former head of the Army's DU program, about how if you ingest or breathe nano
[00:26:28.559 --> 00:26:28.979]  Amounts.
[00:26:29.079 --> 00:26:31.080]  Just microscopic amounts of DU.
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:35.761]  It's going to shave many years off your life and debilitate you and kill you.
[00:26:36.541 --> 00:26:44.983]  And many troops are just inhaling masses of this and they've gone, of course, from admitting it's deadly to just saying it's fine.
[00:26:45.043 --> 00:26:48.784]  So what if there's a 15 times increase in cancers in Fallujah?
[00:26:49.244 --> 00:26:53.485]  So what if there's a three to four times increase in the troops and their children?
[00:26:54.329 --> 00:26:55.111]  The deformities.
[00:26:55.391 --> 00:26:56.875]  The cancers.
[00:26:56.975 --> 00:26:57.877]  It's no big deal.
[00:26:58.238 --> 00:26:59.180]  We're going to use it.
[00:26:59.361 --> 00:27:03.731]  And again, it just shows the mindset of how we just accept this.
[00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:06.571]  So that's coming up in the next segment.
[00:27:07.451 --> 00:27:12.573]  I've been remiss in plugging this because I don't have a lot of time to travel.
[00:27:13.514 --> 00:27:23.678]  And I get constant requests to speak here, speak there, travel here, travel there, but I was already going to be in California in late October as part of an investigation I'm doing.
[00:27:23.718 --> 00:27:24.519]  I'm just leaving it at that.
[00:27:25.499 --> 00:27:34.847]  And MZ, as he's known, the great owner of two radio stations in the Bay Area that we're on.
[00:27:34.887 --> 00:27:36.088]  He's had me on about a year and a half.
[00:27:36.128 --> 00:27:37.569]  He's getting a lot of listeners.
[00:27:37.629 --> 00:27:39.531]  Great ratings for the stations.
[00:27:40.231 --> 00:27:41.032]  These are big stations.
[00:27:41.052 --> 00:27:42.593]  I mean, they carry things like Rush Limbaugh.
[00:27:43.394 --> 00:27:47.978]  And I'm going to be speaking Sunday, October 24th, starting at 6 p.m.
[00:27:50.158 --> 00:28:07.800]  uh... at the coconut grove ballroom on beach street in santa cruz california coconut grove ballroom on beach street and santa cruz and tickets are only available and uh... they're selling for a price to just pay for the ballroom okay uh... they're ten dollars and eighty cents
[00:28:08.821 --> 00:28:11.242]  Because, you know, that's the radio station frequency.
[00:28:12.043 --> 00:28:20.488]  But tickets are only available online at the KSCO website, ksco.com.
[00:28:20.968 --> 00:28:24.790]  And they will, almost every event I've ever had, I think I've had a couple that didn't sell out.
[00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:28.792]  I've had 1,200 people at events, 800, 500, you know, just over and over again.
[00:28:29.713 --> 00:28:33.275]  So, when we've been on the stations a year and a half,
[00:28:34.275 --> 00:28:34.796]  Two stations.
[00:28:34.816 --> 00:28:38.980]  He has one during the day, up against Limbaugh, and one station he's got, and then on the bigger station at night.
[00:28:40.021 --> 00:28:43.124]  And he's got me up against Limbaugh, who's his host in the area.
[00:28:44.165 --> 00:28:45.406]  And the show's doing very well there.
[00:28:45.426 --> 00:28:47.468]  A lot of listeners, waking up a lot of people.
[00:28:47.908 --> 00:28:49.350]  So we're looking forward to that.
[00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:51.171]  So don't miss out on it.
[00:28:51.972 --> 00:29:04.034]  You can email your questions and suggestions to Alex at KSCO.com and we'll see you there at the Coconut Grove Sunday, October 24th, 6 p.m.
[00:29:04.074 --> 00:29:06.695]  It's a really nice theater, I'm told, ballroom.
[00:29:07.775 --> 00:29:12.296]  And expanding on that, here's the ad that MZ sent me.
[00:29:13.496 --> 00:29:17.997]  It just makes me sound too... I don't like flattering myself, so I'm actually rewriting it.
[00:29:20.497 --> 00:29:22.238]  I guess this is the ad they're running on the stations.
[00:29:23.138 --> 00:29:24.398]  I'll read it to you when we come back.
[00:29:26.038 --> 00:29:27.879]  But it's like, okay, it's official.
[00:29:27.919 --> 00:29:35.961]  The most popular, the most popular audio and video internet personality in the world, Alex Jones himself, in person, is coming to KSCO.
[00:29:37.281 --> 00:29:39.362]  And it just goes on from there.
[00:29:39.462 --> 00:29:44.043]  So we'll be discussing that and some other announcements on the other side.
[00:29:44.063 --> 00:29:46.863]  Then I'm getting into all the news ahead of Bob Chapman.
[00:29:47.183 --> 00:29:49.404]  We'll have open phones for that and the Health Ranger.
[00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:53.391]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[00:30:12.218 --> 00:30:18.861]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.

[00:32:54.284 --> 00:32:54.604]  Thank you.
[00:32:54.624 --> 00:32:58.026]  What we've got here is failure to communicate.
[00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:09.823]  Some men you just can't reach.
[00:33:10.624 --> 00:33:15.908]  So you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it.
[00:33:15.928 --> 00:33:17.469]  Well, he gets it.
[00:33:17.689 --> 00:33:25.576]  I don't like it any more than he does.
[00:33:26.156 --> 00:33:28.458]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:28.799 --> 00:33:30.180]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:38.001]  More and more, I sit here with the stacks of news and analysis in front of me.
[00:33:38.801 --> 00:33:40.161]  And I don't even want to cover it.
[00:33:40.201 --> 00:33:45.022]  It just confirms, in triplicate, all of our worst fears and concerns.
[00:33:45.122 --> 00:33:46.703]  It's just now all out in the open.
[00:33:47.983 --> 00:33:51.163]  Yeah, we're driving by radiating your house with high-powered radiation.
[00:33:51.523 --> 00:33:55.984]  Yeah, we don't give the people running the x-ray guns any protection.
[00:33:56.944 --> 00:34:00.165]  Yeah, we're using DU everywhere, including inside the US.
[00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:03.512]  Yeah, we don't care if it kills people.
[00:34:05.635 --> 00:34:12.724]  Okay, you know, viruses and vaccines have caused people to have health problems.
[00:34:13.244 --> 00:34:16.028]  It just goes on and on and on.
[00:34:16.088 --> 00:34:17.489]  It's now all out in the open.
[00:34:19.245 --> 00:34:21.609]  And I just really worry about human society.
[00:34:21.629 --> 00:34:22.991]  I mean, where is it going from here?
[00:34:23.031 --> 00:34:25.354]  And so many people just have this attitude of giving up.
[00:34:25.495 --> 00:34:27.397]  Oh good, I hope we all nuke each other.
[00:34:27.417 --> 00:34:30.262]  Well, you don't really mean that or you'd go kill yourself.
[00:34:31.083 --> 00:34:32.285]  And please don't kill yourself.
[00:34:34.295 --> 00:34:40.677]  We've had it so good that we've basically become domesticated to the point that we don't know what's in our own interest.
[00:34:41.217 --> 00:34:41.957]  And it's ridiculous.
[00:34:41.997 --> 00:34:48.520]  But getting back to this event, and ladies and gentlemen, I mean, it's probably been a year.
[00:34:50.100 --> 00:35:14.529]  Since I've done a speaking event and again I get invited to speak in the Balkans and England and Mexico just constantly and I almost said no because when I say yes to one then everybody will say oh please come to our events and it's not that I don't like meeting people or giving speeches and a lot of folks have pointed out that I am the most dynamic in person and I'm going to give you a incredible two plus hour speech and then question and answer.
[00:35:18.581 --> 00:35:20.342]  I'm thinking about the different subjects I want to cover.
[00:35:21.743 --> 00:35:38.136]  I've got a good idea, but the main reason I don't travel around and do a lot of speeches is I can sit here in this studio and do my radio show reaching millions of people, YouTube videos reaching millions of people, the films reaching tens upon tens of millions of people.
[00:35:39.157 --> 00:35:42.299]  I can do radio interviews as many as I want to do a day.
[00:35:42.319 --> 00:35:46.583]  I mean, I turn down most of them because I'm busy making films and, you know,
[00:35:47.083 --> 00:35:51.006]  Helping work on finishing up this big social network site.
[00:35:51.086 --> 00:36:13.103]  We've been building in the last year That's about to launch in 14 days or less And I just don't have the time and energy But if I'm already gonna be in California as part of an investigation on a separate issue And these are two great radio stations that reach hundreds of thousands of people and MZ is just a great guy Then Why not?
[00:36:14.173 --> 00:36:19.843]  And so I'm going to be speaking, and again, MZ is so nice.
[00:36:20.204 --> 00:36:21.105]  Here's the ad he wrote.
[00:36:24.272 --> 00:36:25.112]  Okay, it's official.
[00:36:25.332 --> 00:36:28.493]  The most popular, most popular audio and video internet personality in the world.
[00:36:29.134 --> 00:36:30.234]  You could probably argue that.
[00:36:30.694 --> 00:36:41.278]  Alex Jones, himself in person, is coming to KSCO, and that's 1080 country, for an exclusive speaking engagement on Sunday, October 24th, starting at 6 p.m.
[00:36:41.298 --> 00:36:44.859]  at the Coconut Grove Ballroom on Beach Street in Santa Cruz, California.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:53.484]  Though it is exclusive, we do not want to exclude you from attending and enjoying this epic KSCO Presents event.
[00:36:53.884 --> 00:36:56.666]  Tickets are $10.80 for 10 a.m.
[00:36:57.186 --> 00:37:01.169]  and are available only online at KSCO website.
[00:37:01.489 --> 00:37:03.330]  Click on the banner on the homepage.
[00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:04.511]  You can't miss it now.
[00:37:05.071 --> 00:37:08.334]  There is a good chance we will sell out, so don't wait and don't miss out.
[00:37:08.714 --> 00:37:13.037]  Buy your Alex Jones event tickets now by logging on to KSCO.com.
[00:37:13.057 --> 00:37:15.899]  That's KSCO.com website.

[00:37:22.464 --> 00:37:27.188]  See you at the Grove, Coconut Grove, Sunday, October 24th.
[00:37:29.049 --> 00:37:32.492]  And I may be able to tell you about my little investigation.
[00:37:36.533 --> 00:37:42.636]  My little investigation that I'm going to be out in California for when I get there.
[00:37:45.118 --> 00:37:46.539]  So that is coming up.
[00:37:46.599 --> 00:37:50.061]  Hope to see all the great Californian listeners and others out there at that event.
[00:37:50.101 --> 00:37:52.162]  But it will probably sell out, so I would get your tickets.
[00:37:52.742 --> 00:37:56.805]  And again, we calculated the price just to pay for the event.
[00:37:58.677 --> 00:38:04.843]  You know, by the time you pay for the ballroom and the rest of it, it'll probably, even if the thing sells out, probably lose money.
[00:38:04.883 --> 00:38:07.486]  But you've got to pay for it.
[00:38:07.786 --> 00:38:08.727]  $10.80 for the tickets.
[00:38:09.507 --> 00:38:11.650]  Lastly, on the plug front here.
[00:38:13.522 --> 00:38:18.904]  I've been working on a aerosol spraying campaign, weather modification, eugenics film for two years.
[00:38:19.605 --> 00:38:22.126]  I'd say thirty percent or so of the film is going to be about that.
[00:38:23.146 --> 00:38:26.047]  And a lot of the chemtrail films I've seen out there, it's just all nebulous.
[00:38:26.127 --> 00:38:42.194]  I mean, you go back to films made ten years ago, they did tests, they said it was barium salts, aluminum dioxide, and lo and behold, the government in the last two years comes out and says, okay, we've been doing massive testing of weather modification to save you from global warming, going back into the mid-1990s, and that's when suddenly
[00:38:43.188 --> 00:38:54.297]  You would see some of the condensation trails persisting, persistent jet trails, and that's when you started seeing the health problems and the aluminum levels go up in the soil, around the areas being heavily sprayed.
[00:38:56.019 --> 00:38:59.621]  Well, now they've gone out and gotten the government reports, they've gotten the
[00:39:02.071 --> 00:39:02.952]  Soil samples.
[00:39:03.692 --> 00:39:15.501]  It's really a powerful film, and it's the first film to come out since the government admitted a lot of this, and they went to government-sponsored functions with top climatologists and others, admitting this is going on, but basically, you know, saying it's a great thing.
[00:39:17.483 --> 00:39:23.647]  It's a very important documentary, and it's on pre-sale now, and we will be shipping it out to you October 22nd.
[00:39:23.867 --> 00:39:25.729]  And again, it's not the film I made.
[00:39:25.749 --> 00:39:26.990]  It's produced by G. Edward Griffin.
[00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:29.772]  And some folks are like, well, why aren't you just waiting to promote yours?
[00:39:29.812 --> 00:39:30.953]  Well, I don't care.
[00:39:31.693 --> 00:39:33.234]  I just want to get the information out.
[00:39:33.775 --> 00:39:37.057]  And this film is, I think, worthy of your consideration.
[00:39:37.578 --> 00:39:40.120]  I think it's something that's important and needs to be seen.
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:42.782]  It's called, What in the World Are They Spring?
[00:39:43.662 --> 00:39:46.344]  And I have now seen the final cut.
[00:39:46.945 --> 00:39:47.766]  And it's been completed.
[00:39:47.806 --> 00:39:48.846]  It's being mass produced.
[00:39:49.267 --> 00:39:50.227]  And we're going to have it first.
[00:39:50.267 --> 00:39:53.670]  So if you want to get it first, InfoWars.com.
[00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:55.231]  The trailer is up at InfoWars.com.
[00:39:56.352 --> 00:39:57.872]  on the shopping cart page.
[00:39:57.912 --> 00:39:59.453]  Kurt Nimmo wrote a story about it a few days ago.
[00:40:00.373 --> 00:40:11.416]  The Chemtrail geoengineering cover-up exposed, revealed, and again it's available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:40:11.436 --> 00:40:13.516]  You can also write to us at P.O.
[00:40:13.536 --> 00:40:14.357]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[00:40:25.882 --> 00:40:27.403]  What in the world are they spraying?
[00:40:27.463 --> 00:40:32.025]  Available at Infowars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:40:32.045 --> 00:40:33.866]  Okay.
[00:40:41.169 --> 00:40:52.095]  Let's go ahead now and get into what I think are the most disgusting, out-of-control, in-your-face, oppressive, naked despotism.
[00:40:53.649 --> 00:40:59.431]  Here is the top story at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:40:59.831 --> 00:41:22.299]  And if you know any veterans, if you are in the military, if you have family in the military, if you've got family thinking about joining the military, you need to understand that there is a concerted, across-the-board effort going back decades, but really heating up under Clinton,
[00:41:23.561 --> 00:41:33.450]  To put hundreds of thousands of veterans on mentally ill list saying that they've got mental problems so that you can't buy guns.
[00:41:33.631 --> 00:41:43.660]  And they do, this is on record, expanded under Clinton, exploded under Bush, and now has gone supernova in its growth under Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:41:45.442 --> 00:41:46.503]  Mr. Barry Sotero.
[00:41:48.652 --> 00:41:50.833]  And so this is a continuity of agenda.
[00:41:50.853 --> 00:41:51.653]  This is ongoing.
[00:41:52.274 --> 00:41:59.237]  And we would get the federal reports decades ago saying the main focus of the FBI and counterterrorism is veterans.
[00:41:59.957 --> 00:42:06.080]  And then down the list, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, people that want us out of the UN, people that support Ron Paul.
[00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:08.421]  I mean, you've literally seen the hundreds of reports on it.
[00:42:08.461 --> 00:42:10.602]  We've put out well over 100 reports ourselves.
[00:42:10.862 --> 00:42:13.183]  There's been hundreds of mainstream media reports on it.
[00:42:13.383 --> 00:42:15.864]  But they're always, well, maybe it's a good idea.
[00:42:16.064 --> 00:42:17.385]  Veterans could be violent.
[00:42:17.885 --> 00:42:20.429]  Especially if they don't like the Federal Reserve.
[00:42:22.612 --> 00:42:24.815]  Boy, have you got a Ron Paul sticker on your car.
[00:42:24.835 --> 00:42:28.600]  I remember Major Law Enforcement Magazine
[00:42:30.017 --> 00:42:34.338]  Nine years ago, I was in a 7-Eleven, bought it, it was what, law enforcement technology?
[00:42:34.958 --> 00:42:38.399]  Then I bought another copy one time, it was like SWAT magazine, going from memory.
[00:42:39.219 --> 00:42:44.500]  I showed them here on air, and it was like, do they have a get us out of the UN sticker?
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:46.100]  Better go ahead and pull them over.
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:50.761]  And it actually said in one of the articles, go ahead and take them in for questioning, even if nothing illegal is found.
[00:42:51.041 --> 00:42:53.622]  And police chiefs, support your officers when they do this.
[00:42:56.670 --> 00:43:05.795]  And then now you see the Mayak at Homeland Security Reports and now the Israeli company hired by Pennsylvania Homeland Security to spy on members of the legislature, gun groups.
[00:43:06.155 --> 00:43:07.056]  I mean, you know about that.
[00:43:08.156 --> 00:43:09.057]  You know about all that.
[00:43:10.338 --> 00:43:13.339]  But it's so diabolical that it's on record.
[00:43:13.419 --> 00:43:16.061]  I mean, I see this every week in the news, and vets call in.
[00:43:17.196 --> 00:43:18.657]  They'll have DU exposure.
[00:43:19.037 --> 00:43:20.918]  They'll have shrapnel in them.
[00:43:20.938 --> 00:43:21.979]  They'll have a heart attack.
[00:43:22.259 --> 00:43:37.610]  They go in to get health care, and the VA says, okay, we're going to be able to give you this surgery you need, but you've got to agree and sign that you've got PTSD to give you this disability listing you need to get this medical care and to get your medicines paid for.
[00:43:39.811 --> 00:43:43.934]  And then a month later, they go to buy a gun, or they go to buy one for their grandson,
[00:43:45.695 --> 00:43:46.896]  And they can't buy a gun.
[00:43:47.196 --> 00:43:51.457]  There's no judge, there's no jury, it's just been put in the FBI database.
[00:43:52.558 --> 00:43:57.780]  And you got Rahm Emanuel, about to leave the White House, become the new Chicago boss, mob boss.
[00:43:58.941 --> 00:44:04.083]  You know, here in America, the mob bosses run whole cities, I mean, just publicly.
[00:44:04.483 --> 00:44:13.547]  You've got him saying, look, if we think you might be a terrorist, in fact, pull up that clip, if we think you maybe might be a terrorist,
[00:44:14.369 --> 00:44:15.870]  No judge, no jury, no evidence.
[00:44:16.291 --> 00:44:20.994]  You go on a terrorist watch list and you can't buy a gun.
[00:44:21.575 --> 00:44:32.383]  If we think maybe you could possibly be a terrorist, that's a quote, if we think maybe you could possibly be a terrorist, if we think you maybe could be possibly a terrorist, no gun for you.
[00:44:32.463 --> 00:44:33.564]  You lose your Second Amendment.
[00:44:33.584 --> 00:44:34.124]  That's a quote.
[00:44:34.725 --> 00:44:37.167]  I've played it so many times I can quote it to you verbatim.
[00:44:39.008 --> 00:44:43.011]  Or you can just search the term White House Chief of Staff Emanuel
[00:44:46.775 --> 00:44:47.836]  No fly, no buy.
[00:44:48.256 --> 00:44:53.899]  So they're saying if they put you on the secret no-fly list, or any of these other databases, you just can't have a gun.
[00:44:54.659 --> 00:44:57.300]  No judge, no jury, no due process, you can't find out why.
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:05.945]  And now they're announcing, oh yes, the no-fly list is going nationwide to jobs, and employment, and everything.
[00:45:06.865 --> 00:45:15.950]  That if you're on a list, you're not going to get your welfare check, you're not going to get your disability check, you're not going to... I mean, this is how they're trying to scare everybody, and then they introduce the legislation
[00:45:16.849 --> 00:45:18.050]  No fly, no buy.
[00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:27.893]  And then now Obama is back in the news today, I've actually got it in my internet stack, saying, well, we just, even if we can't pass these laws, we're going to implement this.
[00:45:29.314 --> 00:45:44.100]  And without having a law, Obama, even if he doesn't pass the Cybersecurity Act, he's saying the government will order ISPs to shut down your website because somebody up in some shadowy bureaucracy says that that's the way to go.
[00:45:50.828 --> 00:45:53.290]  Let's go ahead and play that video before I get into this article.
[00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:54.051]  Here's Rahm Emanuel.
[00:46:13.447 --> 00:46:22.373]  And I am not one far from liking the mixing of politics and policy, but as my old boss used to say, give me that vote and throw me into that prior patch.
[00:46:22.453 --> 00:46:34.922]  I'll make politics out of that every day, because if it's between that terrorist list and the NRA, I know where America's going to be every time, and they're going to make the right choice, and we have got to start building on that.
[00:46:35.182 --> 00:46:38.184]  That is the right thing to take into the election, and it's the right policy.
[00:46:38.585 --> 00:46:39.866]  If you're on that no-fly list,
[00:46:40.697 --> 00:46:45.539]  Your access to the right to bear arms is cancelled because you're not part of the American family.
[00:46:45.739 --> 00:46:46.019]  Okay.
[00:46:46.059 --> 00:46:47.479]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:46:47.499 --> 00:46:48.159]  I'll play the last part.
[00:46:48.199 --> 00:46:49.860]  I cut it off at the real zinger.
[00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:56.322]  You're not part of the American family because we put you on a secret list right out of 1984, right out of East Germany.
[00:46:56.362 --> 00:46:56.662]  Here it is.
[00:46:58.803 --> 00:47:03.704]  America's going to be every time, and they're going to make the right choice, and we have got to start building on that.
[00:47:03.984 --> 00:47:06.965]  That is the right thing to take into the election, and it's the right policy.
[00:47:07.365 --> 00:47:08.606]  If you're on that no-fly list,
[00:47:09.505 --> 00:47:14.346]  Your access to the right to bear arms is cancelled because you're not part of the American family.
[00:47:14.626 --> 00:47:15.866]  You don't deserve that right.
[00:47:16.347 --> 00:47:19.247]  There is no right for you if you're on that terrorist list.
[00:47:19.607 --> 00:47:21.448]  That should be number one in what we do.
[00:47:21.828 --> 00:47:24.368]  Make sure there's a full force of the law behind the Brady Bill.
[00:47:24.588 --> 00:47:26.909]  So to all those who dedicate their lives to... Alright.
[00:47:27.969 --> 00:47:31.850]  So, I mean, I just wanted to play that in case some of you are new listeners and thought I was making that up.
[00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:35.351]  Now, they have the legislation in, but they don't care.
[00:47:35.831 --> 00:47:36.471]  Let me explain.
[00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:49.706]  The major veteran organizations are completely run by the feds, and they will not organize the veterans of this country to say, you know what, you're not putting me on a secret list to not be able to buy a gun.
[00:47:50.186 --> 00:47:51.366]  They've been doing this since Clinton.
[00:47:52.267 --> 00:47:57.890]  But now they're doing it to, I mean, the calls have had to increase 15, 20-fold.
[00:47:58.590 --> 00:48:05.053]  And the news articles about people who get going, they just say, sorry, you're on a list, you can't own a gun, but I've done nothing wrong.
[00:48:07.498 --> 00:48:14.785]  Or it's like standard operating procedure, even though the courts have ruled it's unconstitutional, that a woman goes out to get a divorce.
[00:48:14.825 --> 00:48:17.308]  It also happens to women as well.
[00:48:17.368 --> 00:48:18.108]  Men are now doing this.
[00:48:18.449 --> 00:48:20.451]  And their lawyer files a restraining order.
[00:48:21.372 --> 00:48:25.275]  And a judge will issue one, you know, if the woman says, well, he yelled at me once.
[00:48:25.676 --> 00:48:26.737]  Okay, restraining order.
[00:48:27.197 --> 00:48:29.079]  Now you can't buy a gun.
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:31.401]  And these men can't get off the list.
[00:48:32.182 --> 00:48:41.230]  Just because their wife, during the divorce, to seize the house and get control, goes and gets a restraining order, now you can't have a gun.
[00:48:42.151 --> 00:48:54.982]  And now they're not just banning you going out without a law and buying one, now police are coming to people's houses or their businesses and saying, Mr. Johnson, you got a restraining order on you for your wife, turn your guns into us.
[00:48:58.223 --> 00:49:01.926]  I mean, since when in America is there no judge, no jury, no law?
[00:49:02.226 --> 00:49:04.408]  The government just does whatever they want.
[00:49:04.888 --> 00:49:25.243]  And then the Buffalo News reports four days ago, we put it out as the top search term two days ago, that if you are disgruntled in any way and criticized... the government now admits, we're listening to your phones, your emails, we've got microphones on street corners, this is in the news, and the government just gave a hundred and fifty three million dollars to roll out
[00:49:27.421 --> 00:49:41.209]  computer system to tie all this together to the federal and state governments and police are sitting there nodding their heads in meetings all over the country and they're being told you are now going to have access to everyone's phone calls and emails without a warrant.
[00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:43.031]  We're listening to everyone.
[00:49:44.351 --> 00:49:49.234]  The computers are tracking everything and the main group you're going to watch is veterans.
[00:49:49.975 --> 00:49:51.816]  Does a veteran criticize the government?
[00:49:52.844 --> 00:49:53.405]  But it gets worse.
[00:49:53.425 --> 00:49:56.367]  The article says they'll be able to face scan you.
[00:49:56.407 --> 00:49:57.588]  This is already up nationwide.
[00:49:57.648 --> 00:49:59.890]  And if you're making ugly faces, you'll go on the list.
[00:50:00.411 --> 00:50:03.273]  I mean, it's so bizarro world.
[00:50:04.635 --> 00:50:09.859]  If I made a science fiction movie 20 years ago, it would be a comedy if it had stuff in it like this.
[00:50:11.301 --> 00:50:13.002]  It's so, that's what I'm saying.
[00:50:13.042 --> 00:50:18.027]  It's so off the chart that I can't even believe it.
[00:50:18.067 --> 00:50:19.208]  But they're just doing it.
[00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:25.812]  They don't give radiation badges to the feds driving around with the x-ray trucks.
[00:50:26.913 --> 00:50:28.133]  Those guys are dead at the door now.
[00:50:29.634 --> 00:50:31.075]  We've had radiologists on the show.
[00:50:32.736 --> 00:50:36.378]  Not just callers who say they're radiologists, we've had engineers and radiologists on.
[00:50:38.595 --> 00:50:41.038]  Now I've got to have arguments with the idiot public.
[00:50:41.058 --> 00:50:45.763]  No, running x-ray machines every day without standing behind a lead wall is going to kill you.
[00:50:46.224 --> 00:50:48.586]  I mean, look, I don't know how else I've got to explain this to you.
[00:50:48.607 --> 00:50:49.628]  It's like D.U.'
[00:50:49.608 --> 00:50:50.689]  's killing you down here in Hammer.
[00:50:51.350 --> 00:50:55.675]  How many of you veterans are 35 years old out there and already are on dialysis?
[00:50:57.591 --> 00:50:59.552]  DU fries your kidneys, buddy boy!
[00:51:00.012 --> 00:51:09.076]  Global meltdowns, massive unemployment, endless wars, a new currency crisis, financially and morally bankrupt, a great and terrible storm is approaching.
[00:51:09.216 --> 00:51:12.538]  So what's the best way to get ready to get prepared for hard times ahead?
[00:51:12.558 --> 00:51:22.203]  In producing Off The Grid News, a weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[00:51:22.363 --> 00:51:25.264]  It's the best way to get a black belt in emergency preparedness.
[00:51:25.444 --> 00:51:27.646]  Survival skills and off-the-grid living.
[00:51:27.906 --> 00:51:30.067]  Off-the-grid news is fiercely independent.
[00:51:30.388 --> 00:51:41.216]  All about self-reliance and packed with helpful information on survival gardening, food preparation, alternative energy, herbal medicines, privacy and security, as well as God, gold and guns.
[00:51:41.396 --> 00:51:43.157]  With absolutely no apologies.
[00:51:43.357 --> 00:51:47.840]  And the best part, this $100 a year service is now free of charge for our listeners.
[00:51:47.981 --> 00:51:48.421]  That's right.
[00:51:48.581 --> 00:51:52.043]  Free for our listeners who sign up at offthegridnews.com.
[00:51:52.143 --> 00:51:54.124]  That's offthegridnews.com.

[00:51:57.745 --> 00:51:59.506]  offthegridnews.com.
[00:52:00.047 --> 00:52:02.368]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:02.448 --> 00:52:04.609]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:04.629 --> 00:52:07.530]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:12.693]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:13.073 --> 00:52:17.255]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:17.575 --> 00:52:19.898]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:19.918 --> 00:52:22.462]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:22.802 --> 00:52:25.385]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:25.726 --> 00:52:33.336]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:33.658 --> 00:52:38.900]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:41.321]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:41.881 --> 00:52:45.323]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:45.583 --> 00:52:46.503]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:46.643 --> 00:52:47.944]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:47.984 --> 00:52:48.984]  Invisible Empire.

[00:53:12.597 --> 00:53:14.318]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[00:53:14.538 --> 00:53:16.259]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[00:53:16.519 --> 00:53:20.001]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.

[00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:50.540]  It works!
[00:54:03.792 --> 00:54:05.333]  So let's be clear about this.
[00:54:05.373 --> 00:54:21.968]  You've got Rahm Emanuel, whose mommy and daddy were the heads of the Irgun Israeli terrorist group, who through Homeland Security is funding Israeli companies to spy on veterans groups, gun groups, and others.
[00:54:22.809 --> 00:54:30.536]  They are issuing law enforcement alerts for veterans that criticize anything the government does, because they know you know how to fight.
[00:54:31.823 --> 00:54:34.586]  I mean, it's just, it's so incredible.
[00:54:36.769 --> 00:54:40.533]  And here's the headline at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:54:40.573 --> 00:54:41.835]  Please get this out to everybody.
[00:54:42.175 --> 00:54:44.498]  Feds use pre-crime to target disgruntled veterans.
[00:54:45.825 --> 00:54:53.114]  Mind Machine Project reports to find domestic terrorists by building psychological profiles from illegally wiretapped phone and email conversations.
[00:54:53.595 --> 00:55:00.843]  And again, the police sit there, in these symposiums that they're rolling out to them, and are told how they're completely breaking the law, spying on everything.
[00:55:00.863 --> 00:55:02.986]  I mean, this is just the lawlessness.
[00:55:04.027 --> 00:55:04.808]  This is real tyranny.
[00:55:04.828 --> 00:55:05.289]  They're doing it.
[00:55:07.037 --> 00:55:11.919]  And the government's contracting with foreign intelligence agencies to do it because they can't get enough feds to break the law.
[00:55:12.519 --> 00:55:17.681]  The government seems to be obsessed with targeting disgruntled veterans with pre-crime and other unconstitutional forms of surveillance.
[00:55:18.542 --> 00:55:28.786]  Demonization and harassment, the latest example being an Orwellian software program that purports to identify potential terrorists by analyzing the tone of phone conversations and emails to detect resentment towards government.
[00:55:30.187 --> 00:55:31.667]  You're not allowed to do that in America.
[00:55:32.267 --> 00:55:35.509]  America's about sitting down and shutting up and loving government and doing whatever it says.
[00:55:36.328 --> 00:55:38.009]  Don't criticize government-run health care.
[00:55:38.389 --> 00:55:39.630]  Don't criticize gun control.
[00:55:40.311 --> 00:56:05.908]  The Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Mind Machine Project, which is currently being demonstrated to law enforcement officials, not servants, officials, around the country, is primarily aimed at weeding out troubled veterans, that's a quote from the Buffalo News, who may be, I mean they were at the symposium, may be planning to commit terrorist bombings or political assassinations by illegally wiretapping their phone calls and internet communications in order to build psychological profiles.
[00:56:06.869 --> 00:56:11.693]  As we reported yesterday, the program purports to be able to identify resentment towards government.
[00:56:11.733 --> 00:56:13.534]  That was the number one search term yesterday.
[00:56:13.554 --> 00:56:14.175]  Good job, folks.
[00:56:14.775 --> 00:56:22.262]  Which is characterized by the technology's proponents at some kind of mental illness that requires the intervention of health professionals.
[00:56:22.282 --> 00:56:24.144]  See, because this is all outside the law.
[00:56:24.564 --> 00:56:27.186]  They've committed no crime, but men in white suits come.
[00:56:27.807 --> 00:56:29.328]  And if you don't like it, the SWAT team comes.
[00:56:29.889 --> 00:56:33.312]  Or worse, a trait of domestic terrorists planning imminent attacks.
[00:56:35.046 --> 00:56:42.668]  Why is the government so intent on targeting veterans as likely terrorists, seemingly unconcerned about Muslim extremists hiding in caves in Central Asia?
[00:56:43.028 --> 00:56:44.429]  Wasn't all of this set up for that?
[00:56:44.449 --> 00:56:46.229]  No, it was always set up for us!
[00:56:47.329 --> 00:57:04.454]  The big cis DHS anti-terror machine has been firmly pointed towards the American people, with the government making every effort to subject its own citizens to measures that were supposedly introduced to fight foreign extremists, the latest example being federal checkpoints that radiate American truckers with x-ray devices at highway inspection stations.
[00:57:05.074 --> 00:57:20.581]  Having already had their benefits slashed and their right to self-defense eviscerated with the passage of the so-called Veterans Disarmament Act, men and women who serve their country are now being treated with more disdain than drug smugglers and illegals coming across the border from Mexico.
[00:57:21.141 --> 00:57:37.027]  In May of 2009, the New York Times reported on how Boy Scouts were being trained by Homeland Security and FBI to disarm and forcibly arrest, quote, we have a link to this, we're not making this up, disgruntled Iraqi war veterans who were characterized in the exercise as domestic terrorists.
[00:57:37.067 --> 00:57:44.849]  And they're training the 14-year-olds, now 16-year-olds, to go out and hunt down and kill veterans who wouldn't turn their guns in.
[00:57:44.869 --> 00:57:45.710]  I mean, this is in the news!
[00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:46.830]  And they're saying it's good!
[00:57:46.930 --> 00:57:49.071]  Oh, look at these lovely little Ugan
[00:57:50.612 --> 00:57:58.439]  Ten minutes into errant mayhem in their town near the Mexican border, a gunman that is a gruntled Iraqi war veteran has already taken two people, taken out two people.
[00:57:58.539 --> 00:57:59.420]  One slumped on a desk.
[00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:00.701]  I'm quoting the New York Times.
[00:58:01.542 --> 00:58:03.564]  The other covered in blood on the floor.
[00:58:03.584 --> 00:58:07.748]  See, they always cast the vets as killers, began the article.
[00:58:07.848 --> 00:58:12.292]  Later describing how Boy Scouts were told by a federal agent to put him on his face and put a knee in his back.
[00:58:12.712 --> 00:58:15.515]  I guarantee he'll shut up if they teach him how to torture people.
[00:58:16.769 --> 00:58:27.134]  Veterans were again targeted in the April 2009 Homeland Security Assessment Report entitled, Right-Wing Extremism, Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment.
[00:58:28.335 --> 00:58:31.417]  We'll finish up with this article, then we're getting Bob Chapman on.
[00:58:31.457 --> 00:58:35.579]  Before we talk about the economy with him, I'm going to talk about the open borders, globalism.
[00:58:35.939 --> 00:58:39.301]  Fox News' Boss Murdoch calls for legalizing 40 million illegals.
[00:58:41.562 --> 00:58:43.263]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:44.795 --> 00:58:46.989]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[00:58:49.875 --> 00:58:54.098]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:54.418 --> 00:58:55.019]  Number 1.
[00:58:55.339 --> 00:58:58.481]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:58.762 --> 00:58:59.322]  Number 2.
[00:58:59.622 --> 00:59:04.166]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:04.506 --> 00:59:04.946]  It's true.
[00:59:05.246 --> 00:59:09.810]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:10.130 --> 00:59:10.670]  Number 3.
[00:59:10.951 --> 00:59:14.233]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:14.533 --> 00:59:18.236]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:18.436 --> 00:59:18.977]  Number 4.
[00:59:19.237 --> 00:59:21.599]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:21.999 --> 00:59:25.383]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:25.683 --> 00:59:25.883]  Number 5.
[00:59:26.464 --> 00:59:30.387]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:30.607 --> 00:59:35.372]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:35.652 --> 00:59:39.694]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:39.834 --> 00:59:41.394]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:41.614 --> 00:59:43.695]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:59:43.855 --> 00:59:46.456]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:59:46.476 --> 00:59:47.837]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:47.857 --> 00:59:53.759]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:04.795 --> 01:00:08.980]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.641 --> 01:00:10.442]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.223 --> 01:00:12.144]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.765 --> 01:00:16.430]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:21.015]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:26.604]  We are now into our number two, Bob Chapman on the economy and a lot more in the next segment.
[01:00:27.004 --> 01:00:30.527]  Vets use pre-crime to target disgruntled veterans is what we're covering right now.
[01:00:31.088 --> 01:00:33.370]  Continuing, reading Paul Joseph Watson's article.
[01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:35.692]  Please get this out to all veterans you know.
[01:00:37.713 --> 01:00:47.201]  Veterans were again targeted in April of 2009 by Homeland Security assessment report entitled Right-Wing Extremism, Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence and Radicalization in Recruitment.
[01:00:47.682 --> 01:00:49.964]  The report warned the number one threat is veterans.
[01:00:51.004 --> 01:01:00.132]  It warned law enforcement officers to be on guard against disgruntled military veterans, especially veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan who were demonized as potential terrorists.
[01:01:00.692 --> 01:01:06.457]  The return of military veterans facing significant challenges reintegrating into their communities could lead to potential emergencies.
[01:01:07.198 --> 01:01:11.582]  An emergence of terrorist groups or lone wolf extremists capable of carrying out violent attacks.
[01:01:12.262 --> 01:01:14.945]  Yeah, like when somebody finds out that they were soft killed with DU.
[01:01:17.398 --> 01:01:19.380]  They're just supposed to take it and love it and die.
[01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:23.102]  And the cops, most of them form military, you're supposed to just die too and love it.
[01:01:23.162 --> 01:01:24.163]  Thank you, government.
[01:01:24.523 --> 01:01:25.284]  Thank you, bankers.
[01:01:25.304 --> 01:01:28.266]  Because they know you've got a reason to be mad.
[01:01:31.789 --> 01:01:33.330]  This is from the report.
[01:01:33.370 --> 01:01:45.580]  The return of military veterans facing significant challenges reintegrating into their communities could lead to the potential emergence of terrorist groups or lone wolf extremists capable of carrying out violent attacks, said the report, quoting Americans supposed best and brightest with Al-Qaeda bombers.
[01:01:46.363 --> 01:01:50.444]  DHS Chief Janet Napolitano, because see, the terrorists don't like you.
[01:01:50.484 --> 01:01:52.744]  The Homeland Security stages the terror attacks.
[01:01:53.044 --> 01:01:54.745]  They stage the cyber attacks, all of it.
[01:01:55.265 --> 01:01:57.845]  So they're the terrorists, and they're worried you're going to find out they're the terrorists.
[01:01:58.106 --> 01:02:05.447]  That's why they've got Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, Stephen Colbert, Stewart on the left, all attacking 9-11 Truth this week.
[01:02:05.467 --> 01:02:06.207]  Because they're worried.
[01:02:06.227 --> 01:02:08.908]  Because their bosses need to be able to keep bombing stuff.
[01:02:09.508 --> 01:02:11.669]  So they can point all this at you.
[01:02:12.269 --> 01:02:12.889]  It's real simple.
[01:02:12.909 --> 01:02:18.772]  They blow stuff up, claim it's for a foggy enemy, build a giant apparatus the whole time that was designed for you, and now that's admitted.
[01:02:19.252 --> 01:02:21.052]  So now they're going to blow stuff up and say you did it.
[01:02:22.393 --> 01:02:23.173]  Understand how that works.
[01:02:23.213 --> 01:02:23.794]  It's real simple.
[01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:25.214]  This is how they arrest you.
[01:02:26.435 --> 01:02:27.095]  They're terrorists.
[01:02:27.995 --> 01:02:29.916]  And their little mouthpieces are part of the terrorism.
[01:02:33.029 --> 01:02:42.140]  DHS Chief Janet Napolitano was subsequently forced to apologize to veterans for the report, a token gesture which did not satisfy veterans organizations that were deeply offended at the content of the Homeland Security Assessment.
[01:02:42.601 --> 01:02:49.109]  How about the veterans associations complain about gun groups, you know, being targeted as terrorists?
[01:02:49.129 --> 01:02:52.473]  How about veterans complain about how they're having their Second Amendment taken away for no reason?
[01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:59.733]  Pete Hegseth, Chairman of Vets for Freedom, responded.
[01:02:59.994 --> 01:03:01.295]  It wasn't an apology in my view.
[01:03:01.315 --> 01:03:03.437]  It was one of those non-apology apologies.
[01:03:03.477 --> 01:03:05.319]  She was sorry that the veterans were offended.
[01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:11.746]  She should either apologize for the content of the report as it stands, or they should rewrite the report and reissue it.
[01:03:11.986 --> 01:03:13.328]  The whole thing is for you.
[01:03:13.608 --> 01:03:15.050]  It wasn't just that one report.
[01:03:17.042 --> 01:03:33.707]  Despite the apology, Big Sis Napolitano, Homeland Security, and the rest of the federal bureaucracy continue to make it clear that military veterans are the primary target of the war on terror with the revelation that authorities are seriously looking at MIT's new pre-crime software as a useful tool with which to spy on the vets' private communications.
[01:03:34.107 --> 01:03:35.087]  They're already doing this.
[01:03:35.147 --> 01:03:36.227]  They're just now rolling it out.
[01:03:37.608 --> 01:03:41.429]  Identify emotional spikes and betray resentment towards government.
[01:03:41.449 --> 01:03:42.029]  These are quotes.
[01:03:44.031 --> 01:03:48.667]  And that target them with surveillance designed to be used on suspected terrorists.
[01:03:49.994 --> 01:04:05.363]  While the CIA blocks a lawsuit brought by veterans concerning illegal experiments on troops between the fifties and seventies, and while police officers beat those same veterans nearly to death, we have links to that, the authorities, not the servants, continue to make vets the number one domestic target of the war on terror.
[01:04:05.683 --> 01:04:17.571]  A sobering reminder of the fact that the feds have identified the American people as their main enemy and are now focusing the vast and expanding force of big government against those who have considered themselves patriots for their entire lives.
[01:04:18.371 --> 01:04:21.174]  But they know you're going to wake up to who the real terrorists are.
[01:04:21.394 --> 01:04:23.876]  That America's been taken over by offshore megacorporations.
[01:04:24.317 --> 01:04:29.142]  They know that you're waking up to all of this and they are coming after you.
[01:04:30.983 --> 01:04:33.786]  Homeland security is for the American people.
[01:04:33.866 --> 01:04:37.410]  It is a classical tyranny wrapped in a high-tech sleeve.
[01:04:39.085 --> 01:04:41.468]  And that it is expanding against all of us.
[01:04:42.369 --> 01:04:56.224]  And the problem is the government can give questionnaires to the TSA, the troops, the FBI, the police, and can always find a willing reservoir of useful idiots who like petty power who will stomp all over our liberties and freedoms.
[01:04:56.985 --> 01:04:57.886]  We are under attack.
[01:04:59.841 --> 01:05:02.584]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[01:05:02.985 --> 01:05:06.509]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[01:05:06.769 --> 01:05:09.412]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[01:05:09.652 --> 01:05:14.598]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[01:05:15.018 --> 01:05:20.660]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.

[01:05:31.165 --> 01:05:39.288]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it, with open talk of a strike on Iran in the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.

[01:05:41.869 --> 01:05:43.910]  The place to go is efoodsdirect.com.

[01:06:04.013 --> 01:06:04.934]  Tyranny is here.
[01:06:05.274 --> 01:06:08.919]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:06:09.199 --> 01:06:11.421]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:06:11.602 --> 01:06:16.887]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:06:17.308 --> 01:06:23.535]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:06:23.955 --> 01:06:29.517]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:06:29.937 --> 01:06:33.638]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:06:34.118 --> 01:06:38.119]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:06:38.399 --> 01:06:43.920]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:47.481]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:06:47.901 --> 01:06:49.302]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:06:49.882 --> 01:06:50.302]  It's here.

[01:07:00.586 --> 01:07:15.051]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:07:16.051 --> 01:07:19.733]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:20.751 --> 01:07:32.741]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:07:33.502 --> 01:07:40.767]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:07:41.468 --> 01:07:51.076]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:07:51.837 --> 01:07:55.099]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:58.963]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:08:05.148 --> 01:08:08.651]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:08:16.911 --> 01:08:18.712]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:18.792 --> 01:08:22.595]  Thank you for joining us on this Friday edition, October 1st, 2010.
[01:08:23.115 --> 01:08:29.140]  Mike Adams, the health ranger, and his lovely wife have arrived here at the studios, in studio here in Austin, Texas.
[01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:33.563]  They'll be on with us in the next hour to talk about a host of key issues.
[01:08:34.724 --> 01:08:36.986]  But I was just completing, going over
[01:08:38.991 --> 01:08:59.299]  This article, uh, feds use pre-crime to target disgruntled veterans and I wanted to first talk about this with Bob Chapman before we get into the economy and Rupert Murdoch calling for legalization of 40 million illegal aliens so they can get them on the political take and have the Chicago Mafia machine completely take over the country.
[01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:02.981]  But more and more veterans are starting to understand
[01:09:03.661 --> 01:09:08.326]  that the entire homeland security system is pointed at them and true patriots.
[01:09:08.467 --> 01:09:13.532]  We are the enemy of this criminal corporate state known as the New World Order.
[01:09:13.913 --> 01:09:21.521]  But I'm just amazed that they can come out in AP, Buffalo News, Wired Magazine and admit, okay, homeland security
[01:09:22.592 --> 01:09:25.193]  Is already trolling your phone calls, your emails, everything.
[01:09:25.713 --> 01:09:31.615]  And if a veteran or anybody else mildly criticizes the government, they say, we're going to surveil you more.
[01:09:32.255 --> 01:09:34.556]  I mean, this is a active chilling effect.
[01:09:34.896 --> 01:09:37.077]  They're coming out and going, OK, we are breaking the law.
[01:09:37.377 --> 01:09:38.438]  We are watching all of you.
[01:09:38.798 --> 01:09:40.398]  You see this whole Homeland Security thing?
[01:09:40.438 --> 01:09:41.359]  It's set up for you.
[01:09:41.759 --> 01:09:46.720]  And they know most people, police, veterans, bureaucrats, are cowards deep down.
[01:09:47.641 --> 01:09:51.222]  OK, and on average, I would say veterans have more courage than the general public.
[01:09:52.347 --> 01:10:05.945]  They have the courage, and they've done psychological studies on this, where somebody in the military will charge a machine gun nest if ordered to, but it takes more courage to say no to their commander if they're being told to do something immoral, like a massacre.
[01:10:06.686 --> 01:10:09.169]  And so that's my point, is they play on their fears.
[01:10:10.553 --> 01:10:17.736]  And know that at a subconscious level, we all have a little coward in us, and that people will then, well this is scary.
[01:10:17.956 --> 01:10:19.816]  Well I'm for whatever Homeland Security does.
[01:10:19.916 --> 01:10:21.537]  I love naked body scanners.
[01:10:21.597 --> 01:10:23.118]  I love the banks stealing trillions.
[01:10:23.498 --> 01:10:24.458]  I love corruption.
[01:10:24.758 --> 01:10:25.879]  You know, I don't see anything.
[01:10:25.979 --> 01:10:26.559]  I hear nothing.
[01:10:26.619 --> 01:10:27.239]  I see nothing.
[01:10:27.699 --> 01:10:28.459]  I speak nothing.
[01:10:28.479 --> 01:10:32.341]  You know, it's like the little monkey covering its eyes, its ears, and its mouth, the three monkeys.
[01:10:32.921 --> 01:10:35.964]  Because, you know, I'm involved in Orwellian Crimestop.
[01:10:36.325 --> 01:10:41.350]  You know, I don't care if Big Brother said we were never at war with East Asia and now we've always been at war with East Asia.
[01:10:41.891 --> 01:10:44.414]  I'm going to go along with this because I don't want to get watched.
[01:10:44.814 --> 01:10:50.120]  And they're trying to invoke this panoptagonic system where everybody is afraid.
[01:10:50.421 --> 01:10:52.903]  No, the answer is to come out and say, look, you crooks,
[01:10:53.624 --> 01:10:55.446]  We know you staged the terror attacks.
[01:10:55.806 --> 01:10:58.268]  We know you did it to set up a police state for the American people.
[01:10:58.368 --> 01:10:59.349]  I could read the Patriot Act.
[01:10:59.429 --> 01:11:03.372]  It said it, Section 802, for the American people, for misdemeanors.
[01:11:03.973 --> 01:11:07.416]  We know this is a corporate takeover, and we're aware of what you're doing.
[01:11:07.436 --> 01:11:08.937]  I mean, this is the big issue.
[01:11:09.958 --> 01:11:13.001]  The whole Homeland Security police state grid
[01:11:14.383 --> 01:11:18.405]  Was set up and is being expanded for good people.
[01:11:18.825 --> 01:11:23.187]  If you're not a crook and you're not part of this corruption, you are the enemy.
[01:11:23.847 --> 01:11:26.068]  And you can't run the white flag up to these people.
[01:11:27.813 --> 01:11:37.920]  Bob Chapman, veteran, military intelligence, biggest private silver and gold broker in history, had the biggest newsletter, went into retirement, have come back with the International Forecaster.
[01:11:38.621 --> 01:11:47.567]  Why can something like this be so big, so out in the open, and people are starting to recognize it, starting to talk about it?
[01:11:48.408 --> 01:11:55.592]  This radio show is really trying to force this out into mainline debate, and we're starting to get some toeholds here.
[01:11:55.952 --> 01:11:58.473]  But I mean, this is just so blatantly obvious, Bob.
[01:11:59.794 --> 01:12:01.635]  Well, it's an evolutionary process.
[01:12:01.675 --> 01:12:05.577]  They have to have an enemy that they think they can control.
[01:12:06.597 --> 01:12:15.162]  And they think in a final analysis, even though these people are courageous, otherwise they wouldn't have been doing what they were doing on behalf of our government.
[01:12:16.293 --> 01:12:42.567]  uh... they want them uh... to be in a uh... position with a rock balance and if they continually attack them and i don't care what the public thinks because i don't think the public's going to do anything i mean the veterans groups will speak out as you just shown and perhaps some others but by and large uh... you're not going to hear much the uh... i would think it's a
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:49.021]  A move that's being made to set up a larger move later.
[01:12:50.182 --> 01:12:58.884]  The interception of electronic communications of one kind or another is something that they're going to put online.
[01:12:58.924 --> 01:13:02.825]  And a lot of these people are outspoken, and they're really afraid of them.
[01:13:03.365 --> 01:13:13.048]  Because, let's have an example, you have a demonstration, it turns wild, they bring in the National Guard, and the people who were there
[01:13:13.875 --> 01:13:15.336]  Uh, saying, hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[01:13:16.097 --> 01:13:17.858]  You know, I used to belong to this unit.
[01:13:18.258 --> 01:13:21.441]  I just came back from doing two tours in the Middle East.
[01:13:22.161 --> 01:13:23.582]  I mean, what are you trying to do to us?
[01:13:24.543 --> 01:13:27.145]  And the guys who are in uniform are going to say, yeah.
[01:13:27.565 --> 01:13:28.646]  Yeah, what are we doing here?
[01:13:28.726 --> 01:13:32.569]  And by the way, that's already hanging in Spain and in Greece and all over Europe.
[01:13:32.829 --> 01:13:34.951]  The police are joining the protesters.
[01:13:35.191 --> 01:13:37.592]  And that happened with Ceausescu in Romania.
[01:13:38.713 --> 01:13:40.795]  And that just happened down in Ecuador.
[01:13:42.782 --> 01:13:47.603]  That government is toitering on the edge as well.
[01:13:48.443 --> 01:14:00.546]  And, you know, people have been recommending that people who want to retire to go there because it's inexpensive and it's a quiet life and that sort of thing.
[01:14:01.286 --> 01:14:08.968]  And anytime you've got a communist government, you have the possibility of having real problems.
[01:14:09.908 --> 01:14:12.129]  And I wouldn't be surprised if in the future
[01:14:12.956 --> 01:14:15.377]  Venezuela didn't have the same kind of problems.
[01:14:16.478 --> 01:14:19.340]  And Peru has shut their border, I think, with Bolivia.
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:25.823]  But anyway, these are the kind of things that are going on all over the world.
[01:14:26.263 --> 01:14:36.389]  And one of the reasons is because of Alex Jones and people like him, who are on the radio, telling the people the truth, and these broadcasts are going all over the world.
[01:14:37.249 --> 01:14:40.011]  And believe me, I know, and Alex knows too, because
[01:14:40.427 --> 01:14:44.832]  He must get the same kinds of letters I get from all over the world.
[01:14:45.913 --> 01:14:54.142]  In fact, we've started carrying some of our information in Spanish as well as German.
[01:14:56.164 --> 01:15:00.429]  And that'll probably expand as we go on, because it's easier for someone
[01:15:01.434 --> 01:15:04.956]  To read German, if they're German, they would rather read it that way.
[01:15:05.136 --> 01:15:17.084]  Now Bob, to interrupt for a moment, we're rolling video on screen of the fall of Ceaușescu in Romania when people just finally said we're not going along with this tyranny anymore.
[01:15:17.604 --> 01:15:22.347]  In a matter of hours, the general public just came out in mass and the police
[01:15:23.067 --> 01:15:49.380]  uh... basically joined them because they've been educated and and and so that's why the demonization of veterans is going on that's why police i mean come on cops you're smart most uh... police are veterans that's who they recruit from they're trying to train you to spy on and hate veterans and see it as quasi-illegal to even mildly criticize the government they're trying to induct you into secret policedom because they know that when you go into a real tyranny
[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:51.742]  And you do have a command and control system.
[01:15:52.062 --> 01:16:04.894]  What happened in Rome, and it's happening in South America, and what happens in Eastern Europe, it happens in England in the last few hundred years, that once they put a tyranny in, the main group they've got to watch is the military.
[01:16:05.134 --> 01:16:06.615]  And that's where the purges are.
[01:16:06.995 --> 01:16:10.138]  That's where the terror and the secret arrests are going to go on.
[01:16:11.119 --> 01:16:13.000]  Just like Hitler did after he got into power.
[01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:18.283]  Once they really take over, we're getting to that point, they're going to purge the military and police.
[01:16:18.843 --> 01:16:20.664]  And so history is repeating itself.
[01:16:20.964 --> 01:16:27.628]  So of course every time we get a Homeland Security report or the news reports on one of these events, it's all about veterans.
[01:16:28.028 --> 01:16:29.269]  It's all about gun owners.
[01:16:29.649 --> 01:16:30.970]  It's all about police.
[01:16:32.014 --> 01:16:50.243]  It's all about kicking cops out who don't go along with tyranny because A, they've got to get a bunch of thugs in to carry out their takeover, but B, once they've engaged in their takeover, they've got to fully surveil you because tyrants will come up through the military ranks and try to take over the system.
[01:16:50.664 --> 01:16:52.945]  Once you have a command and control shadow government,
[01:16:53.445 --> 01:17:01.027]  And it comes out in the open, then you can have coup d'etats within the structure and the bureaucracy over and over and over again.
[01:17:01.367 --> 01:17:08.369]  And so this scientific dictatorship has gauged all of that and is going after its number one enemy, the military.
[01:17:08.729 --> 01:17:10.709]  So you need to understand this, Bob Chapman.
[01:17:12.490 --> 01:17:18.231]  Well, I think you could put it more eloquently because it's exactly what they're trying to do.
[01:17:19.072 --> 01:17:20.792]  And that would pit the
[01:17:21.565 --> 01:17:30.069]  Active forces and the police against the military, and let the public know that these veterans are a bunch of crazy people who are terrorists.
[01:17:30.969 --> 01:17:36.932]  And they're setting a precedent here, they're setting a guideline, a way to go, somebody to pick on.
[01:17:36.992 --> 01:17:38.752]  They're introducing the next enemy!
[01:17:39.833 --> 01:17:43.054]  We built all this for brown guys with turbines, but guess what?
[01:17:43.935 --> 01:17:47.036]  It's now for that veteran, it's that rancher, it's that farm owner.
[01:17:47.196 --> 01:17:48.337]  I mean, that's what's in the reports.
[01:17:48.397 --> 01:17:49.698]  It's that Ron Paul person.
[01:17:50.118 --> 01:17:56.622]  Real Americans that are opposing the criminal takeover, that know what's going on, the entire architecture is for us!
[01:17:56.782 --> 01:17:58.103]  Get it through your head!
[01:17:58.384 --> 01:18:06.409]  This is 100% proof, nine years after the staged attacks of 9-11, that I was right, Bob was right, we were right about all of this.
[01:18:06.749 --> 01:18:07.890]  It is for us!
[01:18:08.210 --> 01:18:10.852]  The attacks were staged to take over the planet,
[01:18:11.132 --> 01:18:12.132]  Including our country.
[01:18:12.432 --> 01:18:13.633]  Get it through your head.
[01:18:13.813 --> 01:18:15.113]  This is the total proof.
[01:18:15.493 --> 01:18:16.674]  They baited and switched.
[01:18:16.914 --> 01:18:23.596]  They told you it was for foreigners, thinking you'd be primitive and, yeah, we'll get them, when they were running the foreign terrorist.
[01:18:23.676 --> 01:18:25.756]  It was all to bring down the Republic.
[01:18:28.337 --> 01:18:31.818]  And this sort of thing, Alex, could lead to a coup to tyrant government.
[01:18:33.018 --> 01:18:34.419]  They may have overreached here.
[01:18:35.339 --> 01:18:39.340]  And there's a lot of disgruntled people within the military.
[01:18:40.223 --> 01:18:42.125]  And they're in a command position.
[01:18:43.145 --> 01:18:46.648]  You know, the people in the Pentagon might think they run things, but they don't.
[01:18:47.589 --> 01:18:49.591]  They give orders to people and they run things.
[01:18:50.391 --> 01:18:52.653]  And so that possibility exists.
[01:18:53.033 --> 01:18:56.136]  And the military is not missing this one bit.
[01:18:57.036 --> 01:19:06.524]  And I think the public is now catching on to what's going on regarding these talk shows that you mentioned earlier.
[01:19:07.134 --> 01:19:16.421]  And the direction that they're trying to take people in, and as we've said before, 95% truth, 5% propaganda, and that's all they can hope for.
[01:19:16.881 --> 01:19:19.643]  And they keep on doing it over and over and over again.
[01:19:21.464 --> 01:19:23.926]  And we saw new Gallup poll numbers out this week.
[01:19:24.387 --> 01:19:31.312]  In the last 100 years of Gallup, the media has the lowest, mainstream media, has the lowest credibility in history.
[01:19:32.239 --> 01:19:33.500]  It's like a lake turning.
[01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:34.901]  Suddenly things just flip.
[01:19:35.602 --> 01:19:37.003]  They have already imploded.
[01:19:37.063 --> 01:19:38.063]  They are out of gas.
[01:19:38.584 --> 01:19:50.533]  That's why they're getting desperate, trying to bring in tens of millions of illegals, to join the military with the DREAM Act, to get dependent on government, to be used as a counterbalance internally.
[01:19:50.833 --> 01:19:55.897]  We'll talk about Rupert Murdoch says legalized 40 million illegal aliens on the other side.
[01:19:59.887 --> 01:20:01.448]  Buy the case or buy the pallet.

[01:21:58.281 --> 01:21:58.661]  Good day.
[01:21:58.821 --> 01:22:00.261]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:22:00.522 --> 01:22:01.122]  October 1st, 2010.
[01:22:01.322 --> 01:22:03.102]  Gold opened this morning at $1315.80.
[01:22:03.142 --> 01:22:06.303]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1350.28, $675.14 for a half-ounce, or $337.57 for a quarter-ounce.
[01:22:06.323 --> 01:22:06.904]  That's $1350.28, $675.14, or $337.57.
[01:22:17.987 --> 01:22:21.751]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm, warning of Greek-style U.S.
[01:22:21.811 --> 01:22:22.611]  debt crises.
[01:22:22.972 --> 01:22:25.074]  CBO is drawing a parallel between U.S.
[01:22:25.134 --> 01:22:27.236]  economy and the Greek economic meltdown.
[01:22:27.576 --> 01:22:32.600]  Debt to GDP climbing to unfamiliar territory and deficits rising to unsupportable levels.
[01:22:32.921 --> 01:22:33.902]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:22:33.922 --> 01:22:39.667]  The Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document the CBO has published is a must-read for every American.
[01:22:39.867 --> 01:22:45.691]  Covering the risks of deficit spending, aging population, and rising interest rates spells economic disaster.

[01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:07.527]  Nine years, thousands of clients worldwide, amazing results, and here's more proof of the effectiveness of how Heart and Body Extract supports good circulation and healthy arterial flow.
[01:23:07.727 --> 01:23:08.668]  My name is Crystal.
[01:23:09.048 --> 01:23:11.632]  I'm a 45 year old and live in Houston, Texas.
[01:23:11.992 --> 01:23:15.597]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[01:23:15.958 --> 01:23:19.963]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[01:23:20.104 --> 01:23:20.905]  What did Crystal do?
[01:23:20.925 --> 01:23:23.348]  I ordered heart and body extract in August 2006.
[01:23:24.870 --> 01:23:31.173]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.
[01:23:31.273 --> 01:23:34.895]  Clean, clear arteries are happy arteries after using Heart and Body Extract.

[01:24:07.811 --> 01:24:17.055]  Real, bonafide, naked evil is in control of the planet.
[01:24:17.316 --> 01:24:19.617]  And so many past generations went through
[01:24:21.169 --> 01:24:32.514]  Unspeakable nightmares of death and destruction because they didn't stand up early on or even later when it became clear that the government was run by a bunch of crooks.
[01:24:35.735 --> 01:24:39.557]  And you've got all these big Republicans now coming out in the news.
[01:24:41.303 --> 01:24:45.106]  saying legalize as many as 40 million illegal aliens.
[01:24:45.746 --> 01:24:47.027]  They really want to get that done.
[01:24:47.627 --> 01:24:50.829]  Rupert Murdoch calls for amnesty for law-abiding illegal immigrants.
[01:24:51.450 --> 01:24:53.271]  Gotta love that oxymoron.
[01:24:55.172 --> 01:24:58.394]  And these reports are up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:24:59.775 --> 01:25:02.817]  It says Rupert Murdoch wants amnesty for millions of illegal aliens.
[01:25:03.598 --> 01:25:09.742]  On Thursday, appearing before the House Judiciary Committee on immigration, Rupert Murdoch, somebody from Australia, nothing against
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:13.243]  You know, folks from Auslan, but I mean, come on.
[01:25:14.745 --> 01:25:20.813]  You got people from Australia, Israel, foreigners run everything and tell us what to do, so of course he wants more foreigners.
[01:25:21.374 --> 01:25:24.398]  Murdoch said he supports amnesty for law-abiding illegal immigrants.
[01:25:25.523 --> 01:25:30.786]  He did not explain how millions of people who have crossed the border and entered the country illegally can be considered law-abiding.
[01:25:31.267 --> 01:25:37.431]  And then I have another report here by Matt Ryan today at InfoWars.com.
[01:25:37.491 --> 01:25:41.894]  Background checks required to visit your kids at school, but the illegal aliens, they're exempt.
[01:25:42.734 --> 01:25:44.876]  The illegal aliens, oh, they don't have to do that.
[01:25:46.001 --> 01:25:47.681]  And that's here in Austin, Texas.
[01:25:48.162 --> 01:25:50.142]  And that's going on now all over the country.
[01:25:50.162 --> 01:25:51.482]  We're going to be discussing that.
[01:25:51.542 --> 01:25:56.264]  But Bob, dealing with this open border issue, why do the globalists want open borders?
[01:25:57.744 --> 01:25:59.865]  Well, number one, they want cheap labor.
[01:26:01.305 --> 01:26:04.066]  They want more people paying taxes and Social Security.
[01:26:04.106 --> 01:26:05.466]  That's why they want to legalize them.
[01:26:06.506 --> 01:26:08.847]  They want cannon fodder to go into their wars.
[01:26:10.554 --> 01:26:16.136]  They want disruption within the American culture and you're seeing that right now in Europe.
[01:26:17.576 --> 01:26:30.620]  We have Holland and Denmark and particularly France who are telling the Muslims, look, you can't wear burqas around here and if you want to do that, do it inside your house, but you can't do it on the street.
[01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:37.342]  And I see the Muslims praying, blocking whole sections of Paris
[01:26:39.377 --> 01:26:40.098]  In other cities.
[01:26:41.859 --> 01:26:43.079]  And it's being done deliberately.
[01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:48.262]  Because it's illegal and the police are being told, well, don't disrupt them.
[01:26:48.942 --> 01:26:49.923]  We don't want any trouble.
[01:26:50.883 --> 01:26:57.686]  And so people who are from outside sometimes push the issue.
[01:26:58.167 --> 01:27:03.950]  And we've seen that with La Raza and some of the other groups in the United States and over in Paris and other places over there.
[01:27:03.990 --> 01:27:04.630]  It's the Muslims.
[01:27:05.692 --> 01:27:09.456]  And, you know, these people are a minority in the country.
[01:27:10.376 --> 01:27:13.499]  And they push it far enough and they'll have a serious problem.
[01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:16.562]  And particularly in Europe.
[01:27:17.583 --> 01:27:20.465]  But the globalists admit they did that by design.
[01:27:20.785 --> 01:27:25.109]  They bring in these foreign groups that in many cases aren't really compatible with the culture.
[01:27:25.410 --> 01:27:32.496]  Then they get everybody fighting with each other and then government is the arbiter of that and takes everyone's liberties in the name of maintaining order.
[01:27:34.918 --> 01:27:35.939]  That's exactly so.
[01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:48.589]  But I think it's going to get a lot worse, this dichotomous situation being artificially caused by agents of government, if you may.
[01:27:49.469 --> 01:27:52.371]  And it's just like a false flag operation, actually.
[01:27:53.252 --> 01:28:02.079]  And so you're going to continue to see it, and you're going to see the vilification of veterans and, I'm sure, the Tea Party and other groups
[01:28:03.181 --> 01:28:06.023]  Whether they're guilty of anything or not doesn't make any difference.
[01:28:07.024 --> 01:28:10.546]  And it's all leading up to control.
[01:28:10.986 --> 01:28:12.467]  It's all leading up to control.
[01:28:12.848 --> 01:28:14.088]  Well, I mean, look at it.
[01:28:14.369 --> 01:28:30.719]  The troops are supposedly fighting terrorists, but they're really there to get their resources, and for a black hole, for the government to pump money to the defense contractors, and also shuttle drugs and arms around, as has come out with Blackwater recently in federal depositions.
[01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:44.143]  But then it does stir up the foreigners to actually fight back, then that's called terrorism, but then meanwhile they use the police state grid they've set up at home to defend the homeland to target the troops when they come home.
[01:28:44.683 --> 01:28:47.663]  I mean, you gotta love this master strategic system.
[01:28:49.924 --> 01:28:52.304]  Well, it's a master slave system is what it is.
[01:28:53.304 --> 01:28:56.225]  And these poor young people who are coming back from
[01:28:57.196 --> 01:29:06.859]  Spending four or five or six years in the military and being shot at every day, they're finding out that now they're the enemy because they did what they signed up to do.
[01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:13.501]  It's very confusing to people because they're not used to psychological warfare.
[01:29:14.201 --> 01:29:19.523]  They've heard about it and they've heard about it in the military in particular.
[01:29:20.624 --> 01:29:21.784]  But they don't understand it.
[01:29:22.904 --> 01:29:24.825]  And even a lot of people in the media don't.
[01:29:26.516 --> 01:29:29.937]  That's right, psychological warfare is very sophisticated.
[01:29:30.677 --> 01:29:44.380]  But I challenge veterans, current military people, you better do some research because the federal criminal government spends all its time hating your guts and preparing to kill you dead in a hammer.
[01:29:44.940 --> 01:29:48.901]  And they put soft kill weapons in your vaccines to get rid of you.
[01:29:49.921 --> 01:29:52.822]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.817 --> 01:29:56.618]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:04.481]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:30:04.881 --> 01:30:07.883]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:30:08.123 --> 01:30:12.924]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:30:13.285 --> 01:30:19.147]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:30:19.287 --> 01:30:21.528]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:30:22.088 --> 01:30:22.368]  Tim Geithner?
[01:30:22.388 --> 01:30:22.808]  Bernanke?
[01:30:22.909 --> 01:30:23.509]  They're arsonists!
[01:30:23.569 --> 01:30:24.850]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:27.091]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:30:40.979 --> 01:30:47.926]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:30:48.267 --> 01:30:57.376]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:30:59.397 --> 01:31:03.640]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:04.220]  Number 1.
[01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:08.022]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:08.283 --> 01:31:08.843]  Number 2.
[01:31:09.163 --> 01:31:13.706]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:14.046 --> 01:31:14.487]  It's true.
[01:31:14.787 --> 01:31:19.350]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:19.670 --> 01:31:20.190]  Number 3.
[01:31:20.490 --> 01:31:23.772]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:24.073 --> 01:31:27.775]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:27.975 --> 01:31:28.516]  Number 4.
[01:31:28.776 --> 01:31:31.138]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:31.538 --> 01:31:34.922]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:35.222 --> 01:31:35.422]  Number 5.
[01:31:36.003 --> 01:31:39.926]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:40.146 --> 01:31:44.911]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:45.191 --> 01:31:49.213]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:49.353 --> 01:31:50.934]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:51.154 --> 01:31:53.236]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:31:53.396 --> 01:31:55.757]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:31:59.198 --> 01:32:03.160]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:09.443]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:32:09.803 --> 01:32:16.906]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:32:17.186 --> 01:32:21.728]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:32:22.048 --> 01:32:30.531]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[01:32:30.711 --> 01:32:34.512]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:32:34.972 --> 01:32:41.134]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:32:41.734 --> 01:32:45.175]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:32:45.635 --> 01:32:57.678]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a 1 to 2 month soap sampler.
[01:32:57.958 --> 01:32:58.378]  Thank you.
[01:33:02.219 --> 01:33:09.941]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:16.783 --> 01:33:19.966]  We're going back to Bob Chapman here in just a moment.
[01:33:21.808 --> 01:33:24.390]  We've got the Health Ranger in studio coming up in the next hour.
[01:33:24.410 --> 01:33:25.691]  We'll probably go into overdrive.
[01:33:26.492 --> 01:33:30.335]  All week I've said that I would do a breakdown of how the New World Order works.
[01:33:31.397 --> 01:33:31.497]  Yes.
[01:33:54.281 --> 01:33:58.504]  Mixed and matched Mongol chessboard in here for you today.
[01:33:58.965 --> 01:34:02.067]  So we have Jaren's chessboard.
[01:34:02.748 --> 01:34:05.170]  Jaren is a chess master himself.
[01:34:06.831 --> 01:34:07.392]  I'm joking.
[01:34:08.072 --> 01:34:11.575]  He may be joking, but he had to have help in how to set the pieces up.
[01:34:11.995 --> 01:34:14.417]  This is a nice gift though, whoever gave you the chessboard, Jaren.
[01:34:18.348 --> 01:34:22.069]  Ladies and gentlemen, I look at this news day in and day out, and it just freaks me out.
[01:34:22.229 --> 01:34:23.509]  So I try to have some fun.
[01:34:23.529 --> 01:34:26.730]  I can't believe how real all this is.
[01:34:26.790 --> 01:34:28.170]  I can't believe how right we've been.
[01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:38.532]  And I just hope long-term listeners, people who can go back and see films I made 13 years ago, and TV shows I did 15 years ago that are on the web, and just see how right we were.
[01:34:38.552 --> 01:34:40.573]  I mean, we've just studied history.
[01:34:40.633 --> 01:34:41.593]  We looked at the facts.
[01:34:43.852 --> 01:34:45.293]  It's so horrible what's happening.
[01:34:45.313 --> 01:34:47.774]  It's so much worse than we even thought.
[01:34:48.074 --> 01:34:54.638]  If we were wrong in any way, it was that we underestimated how fast this degeneration would take place.
[01:34:55.138 --> 01:34:56.259]  I mean, the sky's the limit.
[01:34:56.279 --> 01:34:58.300]  The globalists are just out in the open now.
[01:35:01.782 --> 01:35:05.564]  We're going to go back to Bob here in just a moment because I want to get into the main issue why he's here.
[01:35:05.584 --> 01:35:06.165]  The economy.
[01:35:06.265 --> 01:35:08.366]  Huge news on that front.
[01:35:08.466 --> 01:35:09.627]  Riots all over the planet.
[01:35:10.492 --> 01:35:15.944]  We'll get into what's happening down in South America as well with Bob, who's an expert on that.
[01:35:17.165 --> 01:35:19.967]  But, uh, first I want to tell you about Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:35:20.427 --> 01:35:21.728]  They're made in the United States.
[01:35:22.348 --> 01:35:30.254]  The website's gusset.com forward slash alex if you want to get a free t-shirt, uh, with Don't Tread On Me, beautiful design.
[01:35:30.274 --> 01:35:31.635]  They have several other designs available.
[01:35:31.975 --> 01:35:34.697]  Free t-shirt and free shipping when you buy two pairs of jeans.
[01:35:34.737 --> 01:35:40.501]  They have motorcycle jeans, regular jeans, great shirts, and it's all made, all made here in the United States.
[01:35:40.841 --> 01:35:44.363]  gusset.com forward slash alex or 888-8GUSSET, 888-8GUSSET, G-U-S-S-E-T.
[01:35:47.125 --> 01:35:48.506]  He's right.
[01:36:05.874 --> 01:36:09.396]  Gourmet food, regular food, raw foods, it's all there.
[01:36:09.837 --> 01:36:11.318]  efoodsdirect.com.
[01:36:11.858 --> 01:36:14.960]  You'll never stand on a bread line if you have your own bread in these crazy times, folks.
[01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:16.761]  Be the ant, put the food away.
[01:36:16.781 --> 01:36:23.286]  800-409-5633, 800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com.
[01:36:23.326 --> 01:36:26.728]  Big banners up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:36:26.768 --> 01:36:28.509]  Again, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:36:28.589 --> 01:36:30.691]  Don't wait, don't be dependent on the system.
[01:36:30.991 --> 01:36:35.434]  All right, going back to Bob Chapman, who we always appreciate joining us.
[01:36:36.134 --> 01:36:46.219]  And if you want to get a free copy of the International Forecaster, an introductory hard copy or email copy, and it's lengthy, you can simply call 800-686-2237.
[01:36:46.239 --> 01:36:48.280]  800-686-2237.
[01:36:48.300 --> 01:36:54.583]  Midas Resources teamed up for more than a decade giving out free copies of it.
[01:36:54.643 --> 01:37:01.047]  Or you can buy one gold frank at a cheaper price than I've seen it advertised anywhere and get a $159 one-year subscription free.
[01:37:04.248 --> 01:37:12.470]  And Ted actually pays a tidy sum to good ol' Bob and the information's worth it to have the newsletter, either a digital version or a hard copy.
[01:37:12.810 --> 01:37:20.051]  Your subscription when you call 800-686-2237 and get one franc.
[01:37:20.071 --> 01:37:20.732]  800-686-2237.
[01:37:20.832 --> 01:37:29.193]  Ted also told me they're bringing back an old special that is the hottest deal they've ever had.
[01:37:29.873 --> 01:37:32.174]  And that is, now listen to me carefully,
[01:37:32.734 --> 01:37:33.735]  He was telling me about it last night.
[01:37:33.755 --> 01:37:47.342]  I don't even know if I'm supposed to plug this yet, but Ted was supposed to be here, but he's stuck in a meeting with Ktalk in Minneapolis about getting me on their 100,000 watt FM talk, and so he's not here to tell you about it, but he told me last night $26 to get a silver dollar
[01:37:52.423 --> 01:37:57.750]  And I forget which one it is, but it's a silver dollar, US silver dollar, I know he said that.
[01:37:58.311 --> 01:38:04.459]  A silver dollar, $26, to get a silver dollar and the Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:38:04.779 --> 01:38:07.202]  I know Ted's paying $10 a piece for these books.
[01:38:07.222 --> 01:38:07.723]  They retail $19.95.
[01:38:07.783 --> 01:38:08.464]  He pays $10 for a book.
[01:38:11.147 --> 01:38:13.269]  And then you get a silver dollar for $26.
[01:38:13.309 --> 01:38:20.694]  So that's got to be about a $42 value at silver at spot, being 22 plus bucks.
[01:38:21.494 --> 01:38:23.976]  So essentially, you end up getting the silver dollar for free.
[01:38:24.256 --> 01:38:29.760]  Hey, is that a good deal, Bob, to get a silver dollar and a creature for Jekyll Island for $26, Bob Chapman?
[01:38:30.621 --> 01:38:31.501]  It certainly is.
[01:38:31.762 --> 01:38:35.704]  And G. Edward Griffin's been a friend of mine since 1964.
[01:38:36.765 --> 01:38:40.668]  And I pushed the heck out of his book and have ever since he published it.
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:46.002]  He's a great guy, and that deal is a super-duper deal.
[01:38:46.022 --> 01:38:46.563]  800-686-2237.
[01:38:46.723 --> 01:38:55.627]  I mean, what... because you watch the markets, the macro, but also the overall systems.
[01:38:56.788 --> 01:39:00.310]  Bob, silver's at 22-plus right now.
[01:39:01.970 --> 01:39:04.932]  That's one of its highest rates in the last 30 years.
[01:39:05.572 --> 01:39:06.633]  But going back here,
[01:39:08.494 --> 01:39:11.655]  What are silver coins on average overall selling for?
[01:39:12.135 --> 01:39:13.555]  An ounce of silver?
[01:39:15.395 --> 01:39:17.496]  Well, right now the spot price is $2,204.
[01:39:17.656 --> 01:39:21.696]  And the spot market is closed.
[01:39:21.776 --> 01:39:23.857]  It's been closed about an hour and ten minutes.
[01:39:25.057 --> 01:39:28.878]  And I expect it's going to continue to go higher along with gold.
[01:39:29.618 --> 01:39:30.358]  I saw the U.S.
[01:39:30.398 --> 01:39:32.658]  government in there today banging away at it.
[01:39:33.198 --> 01:39:34.799]  They banged away at the shares.
[01:39:35.439 --> 01:39:36.279]  Naked shorting.
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:39.041]  Trying to keep everything down and they can't do it.
[01:39:39.741 --> 01:39:50.704]  What they have right now is a rush by other countries because China's been put under pressure by the Senate.
[01:39:53.185 --> 01:40:02.908]  And how they've been put under pressure is that they're going to have tariffs to offset the undervalue of the Chinese currency.
[01:40:04.148 --> 01:40:06.569]  And they contend the Chinese currency
[01:40:07.128 --> 01:40:11.091]  Is 40% undervalued, and they're absolutely correct.
[01:40:11.611 --> 01:40:17.676]  And why they haven't acted 10 years ago, I'll never know, but Washington's a strange place.
[01:40:18.056 --> 01:40:26.642]  But what's happening is everybody else is doing the same thing, but everybody else was doing the same thing for the last 10 or 15 years.
[01:40:27.463 --> 01:40:28.443]  So it's nothing new.
[01:40:29.424 --> 01:40:34.948]  And, you know, I picked up an article this morning that came in.
[01:40:35.905 --> 01:40:38.847]  And I, like you, pick up all kinds of stuff all day long.
[01:40:39.428 --> 01:40:44.731]  And all I could do when I saw this was think of Ettu Brutus.
[01:40:45.852 --> 01:40:50.996]  And it was Julius Caesar when Brutus ran his sword into him.
[01:40:51.877 --> 01:40:56.880]  And here we have the Mexican Central Bank.
[01:40:57.881 --> 01:41:03.745]  And what they're doing is they have just sold $600 million worth of U.S.
[01:41:03.785 --> 01:41:04.666]  dollar options.
[01:41:05.603 --> 01:41:14.687]  And they're doing that to weaken their currency that just went from, and this is up, this went up, from $13.25 to $12.55.
[01:41:14.927 --> 01:41:22.110]  And they want to stop that because they want their goods to be competitive.
[01:41:23.130 --> 01:41:24.131]  Competitive with who?
[01:41:25.291 --> 01:41:28.452]  With China, Brazil, etc.
[01:41:29.673 --> 01:41:31.514]  And all the countries are doing this.
[01:41:32.314 --> 01:41:34.575]  Now, you know, from an American standpoint,
[01:41:35.726 --> 01:41:37.368]  We're the ones who are getting hurt.
[01:41:38.149 --> 01:41:40.351]  Because we can't export anything.
[01:41:40.912 --> 01:41:42.994]  Because we can't compete with countries.
[01:41:43.686 --> 01:41:45.827]  They continue to devalue their currency.
[01:41:46.187 --> 01:41:55.310]  But this is what the G20 said they were going to do two years ago was a global concerted currency devaluation and that's your report out today.
[01:41:55.370 --> 01:41:59.151]  It's up at InfoWars.com but also TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[01:41:59.171 --> 01:42:00.251]  We'll put it back on screen.
[01:42:01.031 --> 01:42:03.312]  The risk of currency devaluation.
[01:42:03.892 --> 01:42:07.893]  Why should the average schlub out there care about this?
[01:42:09.694 --> 01:42:12.735]  Because we can't export because we can't compete.
[01:42:13.487 --> 01:42:14.367]  So, what the U.S.
[01:42:14.407 --> 01:42:20.028]  government has done is they have pushed down, deliberately, the value of the dollar.
[01:42:21.669 --> 01:42:24.089]  By not paying attention to it, so to speak.
[01:42:25.030 --> 01:42:30.051]  Because they have to make the dollar go down because everybody else is pushing their currencies down.
[01:42:30.491 --> 01:42:32.591]  This isn't official, it's unofficial.
[01:42:33.672 --> 01:42:35.272]  And you're going to continue to see this.
[01:42:36.072 --> 01:42:40.153]  Now, what gets me is the only other
[01:42:40.956 --> 01:42:56.007]  professional beside myself that I know about, Paul Craig Roberts, is the only one who has called for tariffs on goods and services and stiff ones, like 40 or 50 percent across the board.
[01:42:57.188 --> 01:43:03.272]  You know, the tariffs back in the early 1930s, they ranged from 5 to 15 percent.
[01:43:03.293 --> 01:43:04.353]  That was really nothing.
[01:43:04.774 --> 01:43:06.615]  And everybody else did the same thing.
[01:43:07.175 --> 01:43:09.197]  So it really wasn't a factor.
[01:43:09.801 --> 01:43:22.187]  And why there was a depression, even though the Keynesians, and that's a philosophy of economics, would lead you to believe that that was a prime reason, and it wasn't.
[01:43:23.107 --> 01:43:24.588]  But they're in control, and we're not.
[01:43:25.128 --> 01:43:27.949]  So the only way to solve this is have tariffs.
[01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:33.392]  And it would be the best thing that ever happened to America, because all of these countries
[01:43:34.346 --> 01:43:39.449]  Especially the transnational corporations that moved all of their production out of America.
[01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:53.819]  Now, if they build a car in China or India, or Mexico or Brazil, and they send it into the United States, and they put a 40% tariff on it, there's not much sense in continuing to manufacture.
[01:43:58.715 --> 01:44:02.557]  So we've already seen massive deindustrialization, which the U.N.
[01:44:02.597 --> 01:44:05.219]  and others admit is their plan so they can control us.
[01:44:05.719 --> 01:44:08.881]  And they've also made huge profits by having sweetheart deals with China.
[01:44:09.161 --> 01:44:12.423]  But now I'm reading about China increasing tariffs even on things like chicken.
[01:44:12.443 --> 01:44:16.125]  I mean, they won't even let us import chicken to them.
[01:44:16.705 --> 01:44:20.268]  And because we have the biggest sellout government, we're in the worst position.
[01:44:20.308 --> 01:44:22.929]  So that's adding insult to injury.
[01:44:23.449 --> 01:44:24.190]  Overall,
[01:44:24.750 --> 01:44:34.714]  With your long-term forecast for the ongoing depression we're sliding into, how do you adjust your forecast on the overall global economic outlook?
[01:44:35.054 --> 01:44:40.696]  All the numbers coming out that indeed the middle class is disappearing, not just here but also in Europe and around the world.
[01:44:41.557 --> 01:44:46.919]  And we also have all these reports coming out about rioting all over the world as people's taxes go up.
[01:44:48.399 --> 01:44:49.760]  Where do you see this going, Bob?
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:52.621]  Well, I think the
[01:44:53.504 --> 01:45:01.410]  Approach has been and will be continued to be in the United States by the Fed and by the Treasury of the creation of money and credit.
[01:45:02.191 --> 01:45:09.437]  And I think that will aggregate something on the order of about five trillion dollars over the next two years.
[01:45:10.318 --> 01:45:17.023]  And all it will do is allow the American economy to function sideways, maybe slightly higher.
[01:45:17.904 --> 01:45:19.785]  And it's not going to be successful.
[01:45:19.845 --> 01:45:20.466]  And I know that.
[01:45:21.326 --> 01:45:35.269]  And I think Europe, which just raised, in general, just raised taxes and having austerity, and you see the results of that, they're going to have to do the same thing, or they're going to immediately go into a deflationary depression.
[01:45:35.610 --> 01:45:36.350]  And they know that.
[01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:44.872]  Now maybe they want to be the leaders of the pack, and six months or a year from now, enter deflationary depression.
[01:45:44.992 --> 01:45:46.252]  I don't know what their plan is.
[01:45:46.372 --> 01:45:49.373]  What does deflationary inflation look like?
[01:45:52.365 --> 01:45:54.286]  Unemployment of 50% or more.
[01:45:55.467 --> 01:45:57.889]  Wages not only staying the same, but going down.
[01:45:59.190 --> 01:46:01.252]  Public services being decimated.
[01:46:03.053 --> 01:46:10.959]  Austerity, like we're seeing already in Europe, where retirement ages are being changed.
[01:46:11.439 --> 01:46:13.941]  The amount of retirement income is being changed.
[01:46:14.942 --> 01:46:16.343]  It's going on all over the world.
[01:46:16.383 --> 01:46:17.184]  It's coordinated.
[01:46:18.205 --> 01:46:19.766]  And that is going to continue.
[01:46:20.433 --> 01:46:28.837]  And you know, you pop up and you say, my goodness gracious, well, I got some money here, and I already got food and a filter and I got some weapons, so what do I do with my money?
[01:46:30.038 --> 01:46:31.979]  Where can I put it that I'll be safe?
[01:46:32.459 --> 01:46:33.479]  There's only one place.
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:35.320]  Gold and silver.
[01:46:36.261 --> 01:46:40.283]  Maybe commodities if you're sophisticated enough, but other than that, forget it.
[01:46:41.414 --> 01:46:44.915]  Now, Bob, none of that matters, though, that the banks have engineered this collapse.
[01:46:45.275 --> 01:46:48.196]  They're having continuity of agenda, global coordination.
[01:46:48.296 --> 01:46:50.917]  They admit they engineered it in their white papers.
[01:46:51.317 --> 01:46:59.399]  None of that matters, because the head of the CIA, Panetta, says Al-Qaeda wants to hit Europe and the U.S., and they're doing everything they can to keep us safe.
[01:47:00.079 --> 01:47:05.241]  And Al-Qaeda, you know, may be involved in this new worm, even though Israel basically admits they did it.
[01:47:05.541 --> 01:47:08.842]  They need to take over the Internet, shut down free speech to protect us from
[01:47:09.682 --> 01:47:10.823]  The government's own worm.
[01:47:11.203 --> 01:47:12.323]  And here's Fox News.
[01:47:12.863 --> 01:47:13.164]  U.S.
[01:47:13.224 --> 01:47:16.225]  official Bin Laden believed to be involved in European plot.
[01:47:16.525 --> 01:47:18.366]  He's back after nine years.
[01:47:18.966 --> 01:47:24.489]  We better give up all of our rights, Bob, or Bin Laden... Bin Laden's going to get us.
[01:47:24.529 --> 01:47:25.249]  It doesn't matter if...
[01:47:25.809 --> 01:47:25.969]  Well,
[01:47:54.645 --> 01:47:58.587]  I'm sure that Leon helped dig him up because he's been dead that long.
[01:48:05.842 --> 01:48:09.144]  The Indian woman out in Pakistan.
[01:48:09.604 --> 01:48:11.965]  Yeah, Budo came out and said, this is absolute bull.
[01:48:12.245 --> 01:48:13.426]  He died of kidney failure.
[01:48:13.466 --> 01:48:14.046]  Here's the date.
[01:48:14.366 --> 01:48:15.887]  And they said, you die.
[01:48:16.187 --> 01:48:17.428]  And our media is so controlled.
[01:48:17.548 --> 01:48:20.209]  All over Europe, all over Asia, 100% confirmed.
[01:48:20.469 --> 01:48:23.130]  Videotape of her being machine gunned, getting in her car.
[01:48:23.551 --> 01:48:26.112]  And our media said, she hit her head.
[01:48:26.892 --> 01:48:28.873]  That's how dumb they think Americans are.
[01:48:29.453 --> 01:48:30.094]  And then they said,
[01:48:31.224 --> 01:48:35.108]  Al-Qaeda killed her, but I've had the former head of Pakistani intelligence on.
[01:48:35.989 --> 01:48:38.251]  He says Dick Cheney said, kill her.
[01:48:38.652 --> 01:48:39.993]  She says, been locked in alive?
[01:48:40.494 --> 01:48:41.234]  Die!
[01:48:41.635 --> 01:48:43.016]  But Dick Cheney wouldn't do that.
[01:48:43.056 --> 01:48:44.398]  He's a Christian, Bob.
[01:48:44.418 --> 01:48:48.762]  Well, I want to tell you something, and this is inside information.
[01:48:49.923 --> 01:48:54.208]  When she left Pakistan some years ago, and she went to London,
[01:48:55.407 --> 01:49:01.151]  MI6 arranged for all of her goods and things to be shipped out on a British plane.
[01:49:02.132 --> 01:49:06.015]  And when it was time for her to go back, well, they shipped it all back for her.
[01:49:07.596 --> 01:49:15.161]  Ever since she was in Harvard, she was a CIA and MI6 operative.
[01:49:16.342 --> 01:49:20.025]  And they must have been hard-pressed to get rid of her.
[01:49:20.045 --> 01:49:24.348]  And I know that people in the CIA were really upset.
[01:49:25.137 --> 01:49:30.838]  Because one of her best friends was my roommate, we were in counterintelligence, and he was furious.
[01:49:32.239 --> 01:49:34.539]  But, you know, you play with the devil, you gotta pay.
[01:49:35.900 --> 01:49:37.440]  And that's probably the reason.
[01:49:37.460 --> 01:49:38.560]  So why did she flip?
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:40.581]  I mean, why did she decide to go for policy?
[01:49:40.601 --> 01:49:45.202]  She just got fed up with the whole thing, and said, this is what's going down, the guy's dead.
[01:49:46.562 --> 01:49:49.143]  And they just took her out, they can't have people
[01:49:49.833 --> 01:49:52.374]  Uh, in that kind of a position saying those kind of things.
[01:49:52.474 --> 01:49:53.475]  I gotta control everything.
[01:49:53.535 --> 01:49:54.996]  But Bob, she hit her head.
[01:49:56.156 --> 01:49:57.617]  Fox News said she hit her head.
[01:49:57.657 --> 01:49:58.577]  She just fell down.
[01:49:59.478 --> 01:50:00.578]  She wasn't assassinated.
[01:50:00.598 --> 01:50:03.219]  She certainly wasn't an alcoholic because she didn't drink.
[01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:05.360]  I know a great deal about the woman.
[01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:06.381]  No, she hit her head.
[01:50:08.206 --> 01:50:09.347]  No, but I'm being sarcastic.
[01:50:10.567 --> 01:50:13.749]  For two days, they said she hit her head, and then they had to go, okay, she was shot.
[01:50:14.249 --> 01:50:20.312]  But, I mean, going back, so when you were in counterintelligence, you were roommates, what, in Germany with her friend?
[01:50:21.053 --> 01:50:21.953]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:50:22.593 --> 01:50:27.496]  And he went on to a long, very distinguished career in the State Department.
[01:50:28.476 --> 01:50:29.957]  His name is Peter Galbraith.
[01:50:31.418 --> 01:50:33.099]  John Kenneth Galbraith's son.
[01:50:33.726 --> 01:50:38.868]  And the brother of Jim Galbraith, who's an economist from that infamous place called Texas.
[01:50:39.588 --> 01:50:44.710]  Tell you what, Bob, instead of me making jokes about this, recap the full story for folks that want to hear about this.
[01:50:45.050 --> 01:50:46.850]  Give us any more intel on Ms.
[01:50:46.930 --> 01:50:47.390]  Budo.
[01:50:47.411 --> 01:50:56.493]  Again, folks, they think you're so stupid, they tell you to run x-ray machines without protection, they tell you DU isn't bad for you, and they tell you Budo hit her head.
[01:50:56.513 --> 01:50:57.794]  Hit her little head!
[01:50:59.858 --> 01:51:01.099]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:01.159 --> 01:51:06.501]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:06.742 --> 01:51:11.364]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:11.764 --> 01:51:12.164]  It's true.
[01:51:12.244 --> 01:51:16.787]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:17.327 --> 01:51:22.028]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:22.548 --> 01:51:24.469]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:51:24.869 --> 01:51:29.470]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:29.670 --> 01:51:30.570]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:30.790 --> 01:51:33.551]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:33.851 --> 01:51:37.152]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:37.472 --> 01:51:40.293]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:40.653 --> 01:51:42.533]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[01:51:44.014 --> 01:51:46.955]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:47.455 --> 01:51:49.215]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:01.158 --> 01:52:02.599]  What is a wind generator?
[01:52:02.899 --> 01:52:05.020]  How can the wind produce power for a small cabin?
[01:52:05.301 --> 01:52:08.322]  How can wind energy be stored and used during an emergency?
[01:52:08.663 --> 01:52:10.604]  Can I assemble my own wind generator?

[01:52:58.978 --> 01:53:00.619]  Great news for pure water lovers!

[01:54:05.342 --> 01:54:09.704]  By the way, if you just joined us at the end of the last segment, I wasn't joking.
[01:54:10.024 --> 01:54:18.128]  If you go back to the news, the first two days that Budo got assassinated in that motorcade, our media said she hit her head on the car.
[01:54:19.909 --> 01:54:22.511]  And it was on television, her being machine-gunned.
[01:54:23.311 --> 01:54:24.412]  But they didn't show that here.
[01:54:24.472 --> 01:54:25.912]  That's how controlled our media is.
[01:54:25.932 --> 01:54:28.814]  But then once all that leaked, they said, oh yeah, we were wrong.
[01:54:28.854 --> 01:54:29.494]  Somebody shot her.
[01:54:29.534 --> 01:54:30.314]  It was bin Laden.
[01:54:31.215 --> 01:54:32.055]  Bin Laden's people.
[01:54:32.576 --> 01:54:32.996]  They did it.
[01:54:34.508 --> 01:54:36.629]  I mean, this is how insane it is.
[01:54:36.809 --> 01:54:49.355]  So, Bob, going back, you know, the names, everything you can tell us about... I mean, of course, it's come out in some of the news that she was being run by MI6, but you're saying you've got specifics.
[01:54:49.375 --> 01:54:55.358]  And there is the Guardian headline, Benazir Bhutto assassinated, shot twice, then bomb exploded.
[01:54:56.078 --> 01:54:59.460]  That's what she gets for driving around in an open car with a bullhorn.
[01:55:01.528 --> 01:55:04.811]  Bob, that goes back to how dumb they think we are, telling us that she hit her head.
[01:55:04.831 --> 01:55:06.172]  I was just reminding people of that.
[01:55:06.532 --> 01:55:09.735]  But I mean, without me interrupting, go over what you were talking about.
[01:55:10.775 --> 01:55:28.429]  Well, I think the bottom line is that we've covered most of it, but it's one of the reasons, and it's a good reason I didn't stay doing what I was doing and become a career diplomat or work for the agency or for NSA.
[01:55:28.549 --> 01:55:30.491]  NSA was actually who we worked for.
[01:55:31.178 --> 01:55:35.240]  And it was in the early days of NSA and the CIA, because I'm an old man.
[01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:41.263]  But, um, the things that I learned, I mean, turned me upside down.
[01:55:41.303 --> 01:55:45.285]  And I was a street smart kid with a very high IQ.
[01:55:45.445 --> 01:55:50.107]  And so I knew that I just couldn't engage in that.
[01:55:50.727 --> 01:55:58.791]  And of course, you know, Peter went on and it would fit their lifestyle, the Harvard thing, so to speak.
[01:55:59.503 --> 01:56:02.726]  And he went on to work in the State Department for years.
[01:56:03.447 --> 01:56:13.415]  And I've been on programs when people from the State Department will either call in or email in and tell me, yeah, everything you say is true.
[01:56:14.316 --> 01:56:16.598]  And I say, how do you know?
[01:56:16.738 --> 01:56:19.361]  And they said, well, Peter was my boss for about 25 years.
[01:56:23.371 --> 01:56:24.311]  It goes to form.
[01:56:24.371 --> 01:56:33.037]  In fact, one of the people who was in my outfit was Porter Goss, who became the head of the Central Intelligence Agency.
[01:56:34.258 --> 01:56:36.379]  And I was better at my job than he was.
[01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:47.166]  Well, reportedly, Porter had to go as director of Central Intelligence because he was visiting those special floors of the Watergate a little too often.
[01:56:48.767 --> 01:56:50.188]  Well, I had heard that, but
[01:56:51.732 --> 01:56:52.873]  To me, it was hearsay.
[01:56:53.893 --> 01:56:54.993]  But that could be.
[01:56:55.013 --> 01:56:56.414]  I mean, who knows?
[01:56:57.334 --> 01:56:58.775]  All kinds of things go on.
[01:56:59.395 --> 01:57:04.237]  And in that kind of a lifestyle, you can't trust anybody.
[01:57:04.857 --> 01:57:06.678]  I mean, it's a terrible way to live.
[01:57:08.339 --> 01:57:14.061]  I mean, I run into people today that tell me, well, and they may be listening to this program today.
[01:57:14.941 --> 01:57:19.183]  My dad was the head of counter and
[01:57:20.598 --> 01:57:46.157]  counterinsurgency against narcotics in Latin America for years and he said I have to be very careful when I go to places like Mexico where he uncovered a lot of people who were doing what they weren't supposed to do in the drug trade and had them incarcerated and things like that and it's you know you do the right thing and it's a miserable life it's not a good life
[01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:58.147]  And then meanwhile, if you have worked for the government, they're surveilling you all the time and teaching a new crop of morons that you're a terrorist.
[01:57:58.767 --> 01:58:02.250]  And that's one big thing the globalists have going against them.
[01:58:02.510 --> 01:58:07.733]  They've made this shift to really trying to hire stupid people to be their enforcers.
[01:58:08.114 --> 01:58:10.455]  But stupid people aren't that good at doing their job.
[01:58:12.397 --> 01:58:17.080]  Well, I'll never forget, I had lunch one day with Ollie North and
[01:58:18.261 --> 01:58:20.022]  One of the top people in the DEA.
[01:58:20.682 --> 01:58:28.886]  And one of the things that struck me, because they were working closely with the Columbians, he said to me, somebody ought to teach them all how to kill each other.
[01:58:32.008 --> 01:58:35.149]  Well, that's what they're certainly teaching us how to do with these open borders.
[01:58:35.609 --> 01:58:36.910]  Stay with us five more minutes, Bob.
[01:58:36.930 --> 01:58:38.971]  I've got more questions on the economy than the health ranger.
[01:58:43.273 --> 01:58:47.235]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[02:00:16.579 --> 02:00:20.644]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.409 --> 02:00:25.230]  The Health Ranger, Mike Adams, is going to be in studio with us.
[02:00:25.250 --> 02:00:29.211]  We're going into the fourth hour today on this Friday edition.
[02:00:29.371 --> 02:00:40.875]  I've got a lot of other news I haven't even gotten to yet, but I want to get into all things health, the approval of GMO salmon, and the government doesn't want you to be able to even know if it's GMO or not.
[02:00:40.915 --> 02:00:43.435]  That is a huge precedent-setting event.
[02:00:43.455 --> 02:00:44.616]  We're going to be talking about that.
[02:00:44.936 --> 02:00:51.778]  But Ted Anderson did get back in time from his meeting, and Ted, good to have you here, because I wanted to have Bob talk a little bit about gold.
[02:00:53.132 --> 02:00:57.694]  And we've got flames of anger, strikes and fury spread over Europe.
[02:00:58.455 --> 02:01:02.777]  The risk of currency devaluation, gold hitting an all-time high of what, $1,317 today?
[02:01:02.797 --> 02:01:04.878]  We've got all of this incredible news coming out.
[02:01:09.700 --> 02:01:16.048]  And I wanted to have you throw out today's gold and silver offer that I know you're able to hold through Sunday.
[02:01:16.568 --> 02:01:23.556]  And if people would have bought a month ago, you know, this was gold a hundred and something lower than it is now, you're almost about to run out of the gold you bought a few weeks ago.
[02:01:23.576 --> 02:01:27.922]  So that savings will disappear and then gold will go up even more, the evidence shows.
[02:01:28.582 --> 02:01:28.982]  Straight up.
[02:01:29.002 --> 02:01:31.023]  We're going to go up to somewhere between $15 and $16.50.
[02:01:31.083 --> 02:01:31.584]  We'll back and fill
[02:01:54.798 --> 02:01:58.401]  And after that, I think they'll take a shot at $2,000, maybe even higher.
[02:01:59.301 --> 02:02:00.542]  They can't stop it now.
[02:02:00.722 --> 02:02:09.288]  They being the cartel that is continuing to try to keep gold down because it makes the dollar and everything else look bad.
[02:02:10.189 --> 02:02:12.210]  And it's not working for them anymore.
[02:02:12.731 --> 02:02:15.092]  And I see them in the market today trying to drive it down.
[02:02:15.112 --> 02:02:15.953]  They just can't do it.
[02:02:16.533 --> 02:02:21.337]  And so you want to be long gold and silver assets, and you want to do it right now.
[02:02:22.492 --> 02:02:29.397]  Ted Anderson, tell us today's super offers that are only available for radio listeners, and this is good through Sunday evening, correct, Ted?
[02:02:29.417 --> 02:02:35.121]  Yeah, it's good through Sunday evening, and the only reason why I didn't raise prices is because I think I might have you on Ktalk.
[02:02:35.181 --> 02:02:41.146]  I was just getting out of a meeting with their PD over there, and I was just excited as ever to be able to get out.
[02:02:41.166 --> 02:02:42.246]  100,000 watt blowtorch.
[02:02:42.286 --> 02:02:47.590]  Ted, so you were unable to raise prices because you're the boss up there at Midas, so this is it.
[02:02:48.111 --> 02:02:49.532]  This is gold you bought weeks ago.
[02:02:50.112 --> 02:02:54.855]  You're going to be able to pick up walking Liberty Halves for me clear through Sunday at 10.50 with silver now.
[02:02:55.355 --> 02:02:57.076]  Man, I tell you, gold hit 13.21.80 so far, silver 22.17.
[02:02:57.256 --> 02:02:57.616]  Excuse me?
[02:02:57.716 --> 02:02:58.497]  Did you just say 13.20?
[02:02:58.537 --> 02:02:58.497]  13.21.80.
[02:02:58.637 --> 02:03:01.698]  I mean, Alex, it's breaking through all the resistance.
[02:03:10.777 --> 02:03:11.057]  Oh yeah.
[02:03:11.217 --> 02:03:11.457]  Ha!
[02:03:11.938 --> 02:03:14.899]  Guys, Google Gold and put up a headline about this.
[02:03:15.079 --> 02:03:18.281]  I guarantee it'll be headlines everywhere.
[02:03:18.301 --> 02:03:18.281]  1,321.
[02:03:18.641 --> 02:03:19.762]  Bob, that's amazing.
[02:03:20.602 --> 02:03:23.283]  They're speechless on CNBC and Bloomberg.
[02:03:23.383 --> 02:03:24.424]  I got them both on here.
[02:03:26.744 --> 02:03:33.869]  Alright, folks, if you want to get gold, what, did you buy this stuff in the market at like, what, $12.70 or so, Ted?
[02:03:34.009 --> 02:03:38.873]  Let's just put it this way, I'm starting to lose money on transactions because I haven't raised prices.
[02:03:39.393 --> 02:03:47.699]  I mean, francs are at $2.83, $3.62, you're not going to find those out there anywhere, especially considering the fact that you can get that full year subscription to Bob's newsletter.
[02:03:47.719 --> 02:03:50.001]  Well, Ted, it doesn't take a rocket scientist.
[02:03:50.381 --> 02:03:52.723]  If you're offering the Creature from Jekyll Island, a $19.95 value book,
[02:03:55.044 --> 02:03:58.005]  Uh, and a silver dollar for 26 bucks.
[02:03:58.225 --> 02:04:01.646]  It doesn't take a rocket scientist that you're losing money on that.
[02:04:01.946 --> 02:04:07.148]  No, that one, I'm losing money, but it educates the people, it gets people informed.
[02:04:07.168 --> 02:04:09.269]  I mean, people should know what the Fed is all about.
[02:04:09.329 --> 02:04:13.110]  The truth is, you're awesome.
[02:04:13.130 --> 02:04:13.270]  800-686-2237.
[02:04:13.410 --> 02:04:17.152]  Uh, and of course, you ran out of the Buffaloes at that price that was...
[02:04:18.052 --> 02:04:18.992]  Hundreds of dollars lower?
[02:04:19.032 --> 02:04:20.913]  I mean, I'll be lucky to get onesies, twosies.
[02:04:20.973 --> 02:04:28.695]  If you call in for them and you're looking for the Buffalo, just ask the sales people and, you know, they'll do what they can to... But you're not going to buy, you know, a hundred of them.
[02:04:28.815 --> 02:04:29.415]  That's for sure.
[02:04:29.455 --> 02:04:34.556]  It's just... The Mint stopped making them.
[02:04:34.576 --> 02:04:34.636]  800-686-2237.
[02:04:34.876 --> 02:04:36.777]  Well, this is the all-time record for gold.
[02:04:36.877 --> 02:04:38.737]  Day after day, breaking all-time records.
[02:04:38.757 --> 02:04:38.797]  800-686-2237.
[02:04:41.778 --> 02:04:44.620]  Ted, I'm going into the fourth hour today with the Health Ranger.
[02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:50.724]  Will you give us another five-minute report in that fourth hour and go print off all the reports and give us a detailed breakdown?
[02:04:50.744 --> 02:04:51.565]  We know why it's happening.
[02:04:51.585 --> 02:04:53.246]  The Federal Reserve has announced they're going to print a bunch of money.
[02:04:53.526 --> 02:04:55.128]  Bob Chapman, we'll see you next week, buddy.
[02:04:55.990 --> 02:04:56.510]  You got it.
[02:04:56.570 --> 02:04:57.111]  Bye-bye.
[02:04:57.271 --> 02:04:57.671]  Bye-bye.
[02:04:57.711 --> 02:04:58.792]  We'll be right back with The Health Ranger.
[02:04:59.492 --> 02:05:00.252]  Listen up, friends.
[02:05:00.292 --> 02:05:02.253]  This is Alex Jones with key information.
[02:05:02.634 --> 02:05:06.156]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[02:05:06.436 --> 02:05:09.077]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[02:05:09.317 --> 02:05:14.240]  You need to get your own supply of high-quality, storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[02:05:14.680 --> 02:05:20.325]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.
[02:05:20.625 --> 02:05:25.969]  It's all fresh, made on a monthly basis, not some old cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[02:05:26.290 --> 02:05:30.553]  Try their new evacuation pack, a two-week supply of delicious, easy-to-fix food.
[02:05:30.833 --> 02:05:38.960]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it, with open talk of a strike on Iran in the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.
[02:05:39.340 --> 02:05:41.122]  Get yourself and your family ready today.
[02:05:41.522 --> 02:05:43.565]  The place to go is efoodsdirect.com.

[02:05:51.734 --> 02:05:56.780]  Again, on the web, efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex, or give them a call at 800-409-5633.
[02:05:59.964 --> 02:06:05.447]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:06:06.627 --> 02:06:11.370]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:06:11.770 --> 02:06:18.794]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:06:20.495 --> 02:06:23.776]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:06:24.557 --> 02:06:26.898]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:06:28.977 --> 02:06:32.840]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:06:33.560 --> 02:06:36.703]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[02:06:37.403 --> 02:06:38.224]  Others don't.
[02:06:38.644 --> 02:06:40.525]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:06:40.785 --> 02:06:42.287]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[02:06:42.567 --> 02:06:45.129]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:06:45.469 --> 02:06:51.713]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:06:52.093 --> 02:06:54.295]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:06:54.795 --> 02:06:56.817]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[02:06:57.157 --> 02:06:57.657]  Others don't.
[02:06:59.107 --> 02:07:03.350]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:03.670 --> 02:07:03.930]  Number 1.
[02:07:04.570 --> 02:07:07.732]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:07.993 --> 02:07:08.553]  Number 2.
[02:07:08.853 --> 02:07:13.416]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:13.756 --> 02:07:14.197]  It's true.
[02:07:14.497 --> 02:07:19.060]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:19.360 --> 02:07:19.900]  Number 3.
[02:07:20.200 --> 02:07:23.482]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:23.783 --> 02:07:27.465]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:27.685 --> 02:07:28.226]  Number 4.
[02:07:28.466 --> 02:07:30.829]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:31.229 --> 02:07:34.613]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:34.913 --> 02:07:35.133]  Number 5.
[02:07:35.714 --> 02:07:39.638]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:39.859 --> 02:07:44.624]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:44.904 --> 02:07:48.928]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:49.068 --> 02:07:50.630]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:50.850 --> 02:07:52.952]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:07:53.092 --> 02:07:55.455]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:08:05.965 --> 02:08:08.069]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:10.373 --> 02:08:15.983]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:08:19.844 --> 02:08:27.872]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've had this up since it started this morning at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:08:27.912 --> 02:08:34.197]  We'll try to get the former head of Pakistani intelligence, General Hamid Gul on sometime next week.
[02:08:34.237 --> 02:08:37.520]  We're launching that right now, an attempt to get the general on.
[02:08:37.921 --> 02:08:40.423]  The last two times he's been on, we've been contacted by his people.
[02:08:41.004 --> 02:08:44.106]  Second attack on NATO convoy in Pakistan.
[02:08:46.238 --> 02:08:57.642]  Assailants in Pakistan launched two separate attacks Friday on vehicles carrying fuel for NATO and American forces in Afghanistan, highlighting the vulnerability of U.S.-led mission a day after Pakistan closed a major border crossing.
[02:08:58.062 --> 02:09:07.065]  A truck driver and his assistant were burned alive in a second attack on a single tanker in the parking lot of the restaurant of the southeastern province.
[02:09:07.465 --> 02:09:12.367]  The police officer, Mohammed Azim, said the anti-state elements were behind the attack.
[02:09:14.182 --> 02:09:17.563]  The problem is, mercenaries have been caught staging attacks.
[02:09:17.683 --> 02:09:22.524]  MI6 commandos, special air services have been caught staging attacks in Iraq, Leningrad.
[02:09:22.544 --> 02:09:23.564]  I mean, they've been caught!
[02:09:24.365 --> 02:09:26.265]  So, you never know what's really behind this.
[02:09:26.305 --> 02:09:34.627]  It'll take time to analyze it and look at it, but because they've increased drone attacks, and they admittedly do it, two weddings, two groups of innocent people,
[02:09:35.307 --> 02:09:42.290]  Because these are tribal folks, they will then try to come kill you, and come kill our troops, and then the media can say, look, there's a real war there.
[02:09:42.550 --> 02:09:43.330]  That's why we're there.
[02:09:43.690 --> 02:09:45.191]  See, the globalists don't care if troops die.
[02:09:45.211 --> 02:09:45.891]  In fact, they like it.
[02:09:47.671 --> 02:09:49.212]  They like them using DU.
[02:09:49.232 --> 02:09:51.073]  They like using them as guinea pigs with the vaccines.
[02:09:51.093 --> 02:09:54.994]  They like doing secret chemical and biological tests on people.
[02:09:56.135 --> 02:10:02.717]  And so, if they're getting trillions and trillions a year through these fake wars, in oil and weapons sales and no-bid contracts,
[02:10:04.349 --> 02:10:14.954]  Are they then going to stage a few things, or provocateur, or kill people's families so they fight back, and then it's called terrorism?
[02:10:15.814 --> 02:10:19.296]  It's very, very simple how all of this works.
[02:10:19.376 --> 02:10:23.738]  So, looks like that war is kicking into high gear, just like Vietnam.
[02:10:26.704 --> 02:10:32.227]  Now we're seeing all these ridiculous news reports about Bin Laden uses the floods to drum up support in Pakistan.
[02:10:32.267 --> 02:10:33.168]  He's running everything.
[02:10:33.608 --> 02:10:39.532]  And he wants to attack Europe, so we better give up all our rights or Al-Qaeda is going to get us.
[02:10:39.732 --> 02:10:40.332]  It's incredible.
[02:10:40.712 --> 02:10:50.699]  Now, we're going to be live into the next hour, and next hour, I'm going to open the phones up for Mike Adams, the health ranger, who is here in studio with us today.
[02:10:51.739 --> 02:11:01.831]  And we're also going to talk a little bit about some of the things he's been seeing down in South America, in Ecuador and surrounding areas.
[02:11:02.251 --> 02:11:04.854]  Of course, soldiers in Ecuador have refused
[02:11:06.496 --> 02:11:12.038]  ...have rescued President Rafael Correa from a police hospital where he was being held by force.
[02:11:12.338 --> 02:11:14.999]  The troops opened fire on dissident law enforcement officers.
[02:11:15.419 --> 02:11:22.121]  A state of emergency has been declared in the country following police protest against new government austerity measures which would cut off their benefits.
[02:11:23.021 --> 02:11:25.302]  Got the police out there really angry about that.
[02:11:25.762 --> 02:11:27.242]  And so you're from down in that neck of the woods.
[02:11:27.262 --> 02:11:30.303]  We'll get your take on that as well.
[02:11:30.483 --> 02:11:33.304]  And we're gonna talk about a whole host of health issues.
[02:11:33.884 --> 02:11:36.725]  They're trying to take over the family farms and ranches legislation.
[02:11:37.045 --> 02:11:39.886]  The bombshell issue of saying we're gonna put GMO
[02:11:40.916 --> 02:11:44.059]  With eel genes and insect genes, got a bunch of varieties.
[02:11:44.079 --> 02:11:50.424]  We're going to approve it and then we're not going to let you have a label on it to know if it's GMO.
[02:11:50.464 --> 02:11:52.366]  I mean, that sets the precedent for so much.
[02:11:53.286 --> 02:11:54.427]  Mike Adams, good to have you here, buddy.
[02:11:54.588 --> 02:11:55.548]  Hey, it's great to be here, Alex.
[02:11:55.668 --> 02:11:58.070]  Always a pleasure to be on your show.
[02:11:58.591 --> 02:11:59.251]  It's great to have you.
[02:11:59.332 --> 02:12:04.416]  What brings you to the good old USA and what's your take on what's happening down in Ecuador?
[02:12:05.011 --> 02:12:07.992]  Well, as you know, I lived in Ecuador on and off for a couple of years.
[02:12:08.472 --> 02:12:11.893]  I talked to some of my friends who live in the southern portion of the country.
[02:12:12.574 --> 02:12:14.514]  Not a lot has changed in the south.
[02:12:15.054 --> 02:12:19.596]  But up in the north, in Quito, where this was taking place, yeah, a lot of action.
[02:12:19.936 --> 02:12:23.177]  You've got to realize, the police there, they're really underfunded.
[02:12:23.197 --> 02:12:27.519]  I mean, they're good people, but they're underfunded and they felt like their benefits were being cut.
[02:12:28.179 --> 02:12:29.439]  It felt like an attack to them.
[02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:30.640]  And there's a lot of
[02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:33.601]  Frustration among the population.
[02:12:33.641 --> 02:12:35.602]  I talked to taxi drivers down there, for example.
[02:12:36.202 --> 02:12:38.644]  And prices are going up and up on everything.
[02:12:38.664 --> 02:12:40.685]  The food, the basics that they need.
[02:12:41.065 --> 02:12:44.587]  And a lot of that's because of the money, the monetary policy that you cover here.
[02:12:44.607 --> 02:12:46.728]  It's global concerted devaluation.
[02:12:46.928 --> 02:12:47.408]  Absolutely.
[02:12:47.728 --> 02:12:48.689]  And it's hitting them hard.
[02:12:48.729 --> 02:12:51.350]  Their families are having to make tough decisions.
[02:12:51.850 --> 02:12:59.034]  And in some parts of the country, like Guayaquil, which is the largest city, where there's some unrest right now, you know, it's tough for them to make ends meet.
[02:12:59.614 --> 02:13:08.359]  And so when the police saw their benefits getting cut, they decided to take some rather radical action that was, of course, you know, illegal under the country.
[02:13:09.099 --> 02:13:11.020]  And Correa survived.
[02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:15.822]  And now, you know, whatever you think of Correa, he's going to be perceived as a hero.
[02:13:15.842 --> 02:13:17.043]  So I was mispronouncing it.
[02:13:17.143 --> 02:13:17.843]  It's Correa.
[02:13:18.224 --> 02:13:18.944]  Yeah, it's Correa.
[02:13:19.824 --> 02:13:26.868]  But in any case, he's, you know, he's educated in the U.S., graduated from the University of Illinois with a Ph.D.
[02:13:27.368 --> 02:13:28.029]  in economics.
[02:13:28.709 --> 02:13:35.753]  Well, it's come out over and over again that a lot of these Asian, Latin American, African leaders are like Goldman Sachs operatives, economic hitmen.
[02:13:35.773 --> 02:13:36.633]  What's the case with him?
[02:13:37.754 --> 02:13:39.935]  Well, it's hard to characterize him.
[02:13:39.995 --> 02:13:49.720]  I wouldn't say he's an economic hitman, but I would say that there are economic hitmen who are trying to influence him, and he's a hard guy to influence.
[02:13:50.881 --> 02:13:53.362]  In fact, he's taken some actions against the U.S.
[02:13:53.542 --> 02:13:55.043]  about the military bases, for example.
[02:13:55.823 --> 02:13:58.485]  But, he also leans a little bit, you know, towards Chavez.
[02:13:59.046 --> 02:14:04.590]  So, it's hard to say... Well, the same thing happened to Chavez, Hugo Chavez, back in 2002.
[02:14:05.111 --> 02:14:09.594]  One month before it happened, Greg Palast of the BBC said, watch, there's about to be a coup.
[02:14:09.914 --> 02:14:16.019]  And the military grabbed him, put him on a helicopter to, I guess, trump up charges and put him in prison like Noriega or something.
[02:14:16.340 --> 02:14:19.983]  And the military turned back and said, you better bring him right back.
[02:14:20.103 --> 02:14:20.263]  Yeah.
[02:14:21.334 --> 02:14:26.159]  I would say that the situation in Ecuador for people living there is really pretty much normal.
[02:14:26.680 --> 02:14:30.724]  But at the top, in the capital, this isn't over yet, probably.
[02:14:31.144 --> 02:14:34.968]  And you're going to see some more action, political action.
[02:14:34.988 --> 02:14:37.331]  You're going to see him clean house throughout the police force.
[02:14:37.711 --> 02:14:38.752]  There are going to be arrests.
[02:14:39.193 --> 02:14:42.676]  There are going to be, you know, people prosecuted for treason.
[02:14:43.424 --> 02:14:43.764]  For sure.
[02:14:43.964 --> 02:14:53.847]  Well, we understand why in our own government, almost all of the actual anti-terror training is for actually military and police officers and stuff.
[02:14:54.107 --> 02:14:59.489]  This whole grid, because once you go into a third world type situation, this is what's always happening.
[02:14:59.869 --> 02:15:08.872]  So when you look at the RAM Corporation and others, they're designing a system to bring in tyranny, cut the pay of the police, but then basically have purges against them.
[02:15:09.992 --> 02:15:10.573]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:15:10.593 --> 02:15:19.141]  And when you start cutting the pay of law enforcement and requiring them to do more work, for example, remember when they had post office workers?
[02:15:19.481 --> 02:15:20.963]  You're supposed to spy on everybody.
[02:15:21.603 --> 02:15:27.029]  You know, they have to do more work, take more risks, report more intel to the government for less pay.
[02:15:27.489 --> 02:15:29.311]  You know, they start getting angry about that.
[02:15:29.771 --> 02:15:31.813]  And in South America, the police
[02:15:32.854 --> 02:15:35.656]  Are, in some ways, a paramilitary force.
[02:15:35.676 --> 02:15:37.398]  I mean, they can set up roadblocks.
[02:15:37.418 --> 02:15:38.458]  Well, they are here now, too.
[02:15:38.519 --> 02:15:40.880]  I mean, once your country falls into squalor, that's what happens.
[02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:41.241]  Yes.
[02:15:41.881 --> 02:15:42.061]  Yeah.
[02:15:42.642 --> 02:15:52.969]  So, perhaps what's happening in Ecuador is a precursor to some of what could be going on here in North America in the near future, if people get angry enough.
[02:15:53.470 --> 02:15:54.210]  That's my take on it.
[02:15:54.350 --> 02:15:57.333]  Well, Bloomberg reported 46 states on the verge of bankruptcy.
[02:15:58.477 --> 02:16:26.206]  and uh... that they're already having police layoffs in some cases more than sixty percent of major sheriff's departments police departments and the police are even the news saying we've been told just raise revenue we can't respond to being robbed right and so they go out and start writing more speeding tickets and doing whatever they can to raise revenue but that's not the point we need to be stopping the real criminals who you know the big criminals are the crooks in washington not not the people speeding down the road right that's who we need to be focusing on in terms of law enforcement
[02:16:26.766 --> 02:16:29.869]  You know, where's the Department of Justice on the big issues that matter?
[02:16:30.269 --> 02:16:32.912]  All right, we're going to get a break in a moment, but I do want to introduce you.
[02:16:33.192 --> 02:16:43.162]  Most listeners don't need an introduction, but Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, founded naturalnews.com, an online news source that's huge, covering all areas of personal and planetary wellness, from nutrition to renewable energy.
[02:16:44.003 --> 02:16:48.107]  He's written thousands of articles and built a following of over 800,000 people across the globe.
[02:16:48.587 --> 02:16:56.893]  Mike has also founded a non-profit organization, the Consumer Wellness Center, an online retail center, Better Life Goods, and the popular publishing company, Truth Publishing.
[02:16:56.933 --> 02:16:58.334]  He's produced films, you name it.
[02:16:58.735 --> 02:17:05.580]  Mike speaks frequently at national and local gatherings like the Amazon Herb Summit and the Raw Foods Challenge in Los Angeles.
[02:17:05.960 --> 02:17:11.785]  Speaking from personal experience and extensive research, Mike has touched the hearts and changed the lives of thousands of people around the world.
[02:17:12.905 --> 02:17:16.786]  Adams is a raw foods enthusiast, an organic gardener, and a holistic nutritionist.
[02:17:17.086 --> 02:17:23.607]  He eats no processed foods, dairy, sugar, meat from mammals or food products containing additives such as MSG.
[02:17:24.147 --> 02:17:33.349]  He's been called the best health and natural products writer on the scene today and has openly recommended hundreds of health and green living products without any compensation.
[02:17:34.069 --> 02:17:37.610]  He adheres to strong ethics code and practices the lifestyle he teaches.
[02:17:37.650 --> 02:17:39.611]  I notice he's carrying his own food around with him.
[02:17:39.731 --> 02:17:40.871]  He's got a backpack of it.
[02:17:42.112 --> 02:17:44.513]  And I'm going to get some health just by you being in the room here.
[02:17:45.094 --> 02:17:50.258]  Mike has also now made it his life mission to share the most remarkable discovery he made in his quest.
[02:17:50.298 --> 02:17:55.101]  The vast majority of all diseases can be easily prevented and even cured without drugs or surgery.
[02:17:55.321 --> 02:17:57.463]  HealthRanger.org, NaturalNews.com.
[02:17:57.483 --> 02:17:59.464]  We've got him linked up at InfoWars.com.
[02:17:59.484 --> 02:18:00.485]  We're going to break in two minutes.
[02:18:00.505 --> 02:18:04.208]  You're going to be with us for at least another hour, so 30 minutes into the next hour.
[02:18:04.788 --> 02:18:06.269]  And we're going to take calls next hour.
[02:18:07.370 --> 02:18:08.431]  What do you want to talk about?
[02:18:08.451 --> 02:18:10.053]  Because I've thrown a lot of issues here.
[02:18:10.613 --> 02:18:12.275]  But on your radar, what's most important?
[02:18:12.535 --> 02:18:14.517]  What are you going to talk about when we come back on the other side?
[02:18:14.637 --> 02:18:16.558]  Well, number one is the GMO salmon issue.
[02:18:17.039 --> 02:18:20.722]  The FDA looks like it's about to approve genetically engineered salmon.
[02:18:21.403 --> 02:18:23.485]  And it will not require it to be labeled.
[02:18:24.085 --> 02:18:31.130]  Which means you won't know if you're buying salmon that has been engineered, that has DNA in it, that could be highly allergenic.
[02:18:31.270 --> 02:18:33.211]  Okay, recap that and go into detail when we come back.
[02:18:33.571 --> 02:18:34.692]  What else do you want to cover after that?
[02:18:34.732 --> 02:18:47.040]  Okay, we've got the FTC attacking health freedoms yet again, going after the Palm Wonderful company, claiming that it's breaking the law by telling the truth about the ways that pomegranate juice can help protect your health.
[02:18:47.790 --> 02:18:50.972]  And then we've got the FDA, of course, also going after your freedoms at the same time.
[02:18:51.332 --> 02:18:56.936]  We've got Bill Gates trying to tell us that vaccines can be used to reduce the world population.
[02:18:57.656 --> 02:19:00.618]  And we've got infant formula, now with beetles in it.
[02:19:00.738 --> 02:19:01.438]  It's being recalled.
[02:19:01.498 --> 02:19:03.039]  It's made with over 50% sugar.
[02:19:03.279 --> 02:19:04.720]  So we have a lot of topics to talk about.
[02:19:04.760 --> 02:19:07.462]  And we're going to wonder why these kids at 10 get diabetes.
[02:19:08.022 --> 02:19:08.422]  Exactly.
[02:19:08.462 --> 02:19:11.704]  They're being... Oh, why is diabetes up 3,000% in the last 10 years?
[02:19:11.845 --> 02:19:15.086]  Oh, we're feeding babies half sugar or half...
[02:19:16.207 --> 02:19:16.768]  Corn syrup.
[02:19:16.808 --> 02:19:22.534]  And now, not only do they not want you to label GMO salmon, they're going to call it corn sugar.
[02:19:23.075 --> 02:19:23.355]  Right.
[02:19:23.575 --> 02:19:24.837]  High fructose corn syrup, right?
[02:19:25.197 --> 02:19:30.443]  The reputation of the ingredient in the gutter, so they're going to change the name, which is essentially a ploy.
[02:19:31.504 --> 02:19:37.991]  It's a bait and switch ploy to trick consumers into buying more of this ingredient that I believe is linked to diabetes and obesity.
[02:19:39.377 --> 02:19:40.017]  Well, you believe.
[02:19:40.057 --> 02:19:42.039]  I mean, it's literally hundreds of studies.
[02:19:42.279 --> 02:19:43.700]  I think my lawyers told me to say that.
[02:19:43.860 --> 02:19:47.062]  I believe in front of everything you say about corn syrup.
[02:19:47.142 --> 02:19:50.884]  Well, I believe I've read hundreds of these major studies all over the news that say that.
[02:19:51.285 --> 02:19:52.465]  You do?
[02:19:52.485 --> 02:19:53.126]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:53.446 --> 02:19:54.967]  I believe the sun came up this morning.
[02:19:55.567 --> 02:19:57.228]  I believe my hair is dirty blonde.
[02:19:57.829 --> 02:19:59.690]  I believe Mike Adams is sitting in that chair.
[02:19:59.830 --> 02:20:02.051]  Are the threats of a biological attack to the U.S.
[02:20:02.131 --> 02:20:02.431]  real?
[02:20:02.571 --> 02:20:07.354]  If biological warfare is real, what should I know before it happens to protect my family?
[02:20:07.554 --> 02:20:15.918]  The answers to the unthinkable are inside a new book by Christian patriot and author Sam Adams, Pale Horse, How to Survive a Chemical or Biological Attack.
[02:20:16.258 --> 02:20:35.093]  Inside what's been called the must-have manual for surviving the attack and mass panic that will follow, you will learn what the actual biological and chemical threats are, how to respond to events that are almost certain to happen, what the government's response is likely to be, how some will take advantage of the chaos, and exactly how you should prepare to get pale horse.

[02:20:59.384 --> 02:21:01.707]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:21:01.767 --> 02:21:03.990]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:21:04.090 --> 02:21:06.874]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:21:07.314 --> 02:21:12.060]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:21:12.421 --> 02:21:16.606]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:21:16.906 --> 02:21:19.250]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:21:19.270 --> 02:21:21.794]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:21:22.154 --> 02:21:24.718]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:21:25.078 --> 02:21:32.670]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:21:32.990 --> 02:21:38.252]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:21:38.392 --> 02:21:40.652]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:21:40.692 --> 02:21:44.673]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:21:44.913 --> 02:21:45.834]  And I got news for you.
[02:21:45.994 --> 02:21:47.294]  You're everyone else.
[02:21:47.334 --> 02:21:48.374]  Invisible Empire.

[02:21:58.368 --> 02:22:04.573]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:22:05.054 --> 02:22:12.821]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:22:13.161 --> 02:22:21.008]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:22:21.328 --> 02:22:26.070]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:22:26.410 --> 02:22:31.131]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:22:31.631 --> 02:22:35.493]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:22:35.973 --> 02:22:36.993]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[02:24:03.956 --> 02:24:05.457]  This show is documented.
[02:24:05.977 --> 02:24:08.780]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:09.160 --> 02:24:12.683]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[02:24:12.703 --> 02:24:17.206]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[02:24:17.727 --> 02:24:19.608]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[02:24:20.609 --> 02:24:24.150]  Mike Adams with us well into the next hour in studio.
[02:24:24.410 --> 02:24:25.891]  All right, I'm gonna shut up, Mike.
[02:24:25.951 --> 02:24:27.111]  I've got some new news here.
[02:24:27.292 --> 02:24:27.552]  U.S.
[02:24:27.592 --> 02:24:31.313]  apologizes for infecting Guatemalans with STDs secretly.
[02:24:31.493 --> 02:24:33.534]  But let's take the shots the government wants us to take.
[02:24:33.574 --> 02:24:36.995]  That's CNN, one of tens of thousands of declassified events.
[02:24:37.035 --> 02:24:40.757]  I actually already had seen this out of Australian report admitting the U.S.
[02:24:40.777 --> 02:24:44.518]  did this in Asia, everywhere, giving them syphilis, giving them.
[02:24:44.758 --> 02:24:45.900]  And of course AIDS was created.
[02:24:45.940 --> 02:24:46.822]  That's declassified.
[02:24:46.842 --> 02:24:48.385]  The general public doesn't want to face that horror.
[02:24:48.405 --> 02:24:49.568]  But you've got the floor.
[02:24:49.588 --> 02:24:50.490]  This is a short segment.
[02:24:50.510 --> 02:24:51.892]  Let's get into salmon first.
[02:24:52.662 --> 02:24:58.163]  Okay, well, to recap the situation, there's a company that created genetically engineered salmon.
[02:24:58.243 --> 02:25:07.545]  It grows twice as fast as regular salmon because it has growth hormone genes that have been inserted in it from other species so that they can grow it quickly and sell it for more profit.
[02:25:08.085 --> 02:25:10.446]  Now the FDA has been hearing about this.
[02:25:10.706 --> 02:25:16.007]  They've held a hearing for a couple of days to find out if they think it's safe to allow this into the food supply.
[02:25:16.027 --> 02:25:17.707]  So that's the framework here.
[02:25:18.007 --> 02:25:20.968]  And the FDA is full of a revolving door of these scientists.
[02:25:21.388 --> 02:25:23.169]  Oh yeah, they're not even asking the right questions.
[02:25:23.189 --> 02:25:29.231]  They're not really even asking what's the impact on human health or what's the impact on the environment.
[02:25:29.251 --> 02:25:36.914]  Let's say if this DNA escapes into the wild, we have genetic pollution that could infect essentially other species.
[02:25:36.934 --> 02:25:39.815]  Well, it's not could, it already is and in the university studies
[02:25:40.735 --> 02:25:48.399]  Forty generations of the salmon will extinct regular salmon and I was mentioning specifically the new head of FDA approval, the former Monsanto.
[02:25:49.159 --> 02:25:50.360]  Yeah, this is how it works.
[02:25:50.380 --> 02:25:51.620]  I'm sorry, just please continue.
[02:25:52.020 --> 02:25:53.601]  No, no, this is great.
[02:25:53.621 --> 02:25:56.763]  This is what's great about being here in person is we can actually banter like this.
[02:25:57.363 --> 02:25:58.884]  But you're right, it's a revolving door.
[02:25:59.304 --> 02:26:09.369]  Monsanto and the FDA are in bed together just like the FDA and Big Pharma and they essentially want to shove this GM salmon down your throat without you having a choice.
[02:26:10.069 --> 02:26:20.340]  But the worst part is, again, the FDA says it would be illegal for them to require this salmon to be accurately labeled as genetically modified.
[02:26:20.580 --> 02:26:21.622]  They say it would be illegal.
[02:26:22.281 --> 02:26:32.808]  So the law is they gotta say corn syrup, they gotta say sugar, they gotta say, you know, riboflavin, but you don't tell them it's got insect and eel genes and they got a whole bunch of these.
[02:26:33.048 --> 02:26:33.228]  Right.
[02:26:33.609 --> 02:26:36.891]  This is what I call the FDA's campaign of enforced ignorance.
[02:26:37.391 --> 02:26:39.272]  They want everybody to be kept in the dark.
[02:26:39.893 --> 02:26:42.374]  They want everybody to be nutritionally illiterate.
[02:26:42.394 --> 02:26:47.358]  That's why they don't let you tell the truth about vitamins and supplements and how they can help protect your health.
[02:26:47.938 --> 02:26:52.422]  They don't want people to know what they're eating, because if they did, they might choose something different.
[02:26:52.982 --> 02:27:04.553]  And, you know, this is the really scary part about the whole thing, is this enforced ignorance, combined with their censorship, combined with the tyranny tactics that they use to go after these companies, you know, the natural health companies.
[02:27:05.093 --> 02:27:06.714]  We are looking at, statistically,
[02:27:07.898 --> 02:27:13.360]  How many Americans have been killed by terrorists, even if you believe the government's story on 9-11?
[02:27:13.700 --> 02:27:18.242]  If you throw that into the mix, how many have been killed by terrorists in the last 10 years?
[02:27:18.862 --> 02:27:24.664]  It's under, you know, it's probably, what, 4,000, 3,000, 4,000 Americans killed by terrorists.
[02:27:25.225 --> 02:27:36.149]  The FDA, through its lack of action in protecting the American people, has been involved in the deaths of literally hundreds of thousands of Americans.
[02:27:36.854 --> 02:27:39.257]  Well, bad drug interactions every year, it's over 300,000.
[02:27:39.958 --> 02:27:40.979]  Yes, exactly.
[02:27:41.459 --> 02:27:56.157]  If you put together what are called iatrogenic deaths, which means death by medicine, when people are killed by medicine or doctors or surgeries that went bad, that number, depending on who you believe, is about three quarters of a million people a year.
[02:27:56.357 --> 02:28:00.061]  And they've got studies about how the worst diet in the world is in the hospitals.
[02:28:00.521 --> 02:28:00.962]  Exactly.
[02:28:00.982 --> 02:28:06.828]  You can buy fast food in the hospitals just right after a heart bypass procedure.
[02:28:06.888 --> 02:28:12.133]  You can go eat junk food, burgers, you know, nothing like repeat business for the hospitals, right?
[02:28:12.915 --> 02:28:19.457]  But the point is, the FDA kills indirectly through its lack of appropriate action.
[02:28:19.957 --> 02:28:26.360]  It results in the deaths of a huge multiple of the number of people that have been killed by terrorists.
[02:28:26.400 --> 02:28:28.460]  But it's not scary like a guy with a turban.
[02:28:28.881 --> 02:28:29.661]  Well, that's exactly it.
[02:28:30.161 --> 02:28:32.582]  Most of these deaths, Alex, are silent deaths.
[02:28:32.982 --> 02:28:35.383]  People dying in their beds, at home.
[02:28:36.263 --> 02:28:39.564]  There's no explosion, no crash to put on TV.
[02:28:39.644 --> 02:28:40.385]  It's a soft kill.
[02:28:40.425 --> 02:28:41.025]  It's a soft kill.
[02:28:41.525 --> 02:28:43.826]  And it's happening all over the country, all around the world.
[02:28:44.547 --> 02:28:50.730]  And the FDA is, in my opinion, the most dangerous government organization right now.
[02:28:51.050 --> 02:28:52.531]  It's a eugenics operation.
[02:28:53.311 --> 02:28:59.615]  You could certainly draw that conclusion because of how many people are dying and their inability to tell the truth.
[02:29:01.096 --> 02:29:02.016]  Look, here's their logic.
[02:29:02.436 --> 02:29:07.399]  They say that you can't label genetically modified salmon because it's no different.
[02:29:08.456 --> 02:29:09.297]  This is what they say.
[02:29:09.758 --> 02:29:11.260]  It's no different from regular salmon.
[02:29:11.861 --> 02:29:14.184]  Well, if it's no different, how did it get twice as big?
[02:29:14.204 --> 02:29:15.807]  And, you know, in half the time?
[02:29:16.628 --> 02:29:17.169]  That's different!
[02:29:18.325 --> 02:29:19.325]  We should know about this.
[02:29:19.385 --> 02:29:24.986]  It's not like they bred, you know, bigger salmon together, you know, the old-fashioned natural way to get a bigger one.
[02:29:25.006 --> 02:29:25.547]  That's fine.
[02:29:25.867 --> 02:29:28.627]  They put different genes of different animals in it.
[02:29:29.187 --> 02:29:30.728]  Well, exactly, and I'm glad you brought this up.
[02:29:30.748 --> 02:29:31.168]  Well, stay there.
[02:29:31.188 --> 02:29:31.648]  We've got a break.
[02:29:31.688 --> 02:29:33.548]  Long segment, 18-minute segment coming up.
[02:29:33.848 --> 02:29:35.769]  We're going to be able to roll with all this.
[02:29:35.889 --> 02:29:41.710]  Mike Adams here with us, and we're going to get into the baby formula, the melamine, the mercury, the shots.
[02:29:42.550 --> 02:29:44.653]  The government, just every day or two, a new article.
[02:29:44.693 --> 02:29:47.977]  Yeah, we secretly, you know, poison children with polio.
[02:29:48.038 --> 02:29:49.740]  We'll take our shots to take our vaccines.
[02:29:49.900 --> 02:29:50.801]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.302 --> 02:29:52.884]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.825 --> 02:29:56.509]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.701 --> 02:30:01.303]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[02:31:04.559 --> 02:31:07.563]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:31:07.803 --> 02:31:12.588]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:31:12.608 --> 02:31:18.815]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:31:18.995 --> 02:31:21.238]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:31:21.758 --> 02:31:22.038]  Tim Geithner?
[02:31:22.058 --> 02:31:22.479]  Bernanke?
[02:31:22.579 --> 02:31:23.339]  They're arsonists!
[02:31:23.379 --> 02:31:24.500]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:31:24.520 --> 02:31:26.762]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:31:40.652 --> 02:31:47.556]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:31:47.936 --> 02:31:57.061]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv

[02:32:02.187 --> 02:32:05.712]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[02:32:05.973 --> 02:32:08.617]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[02:32:08.857 --> 02:32:13.785]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.

[02:33:04.349 --> 02:33:05.050]  Big Brother.
[02:33:05.330 --> 02:33:06.632]  Mainstream media.
[02:33:07.012 --> 02:33:08.174]  Government cover-ups.
[02:33:08.394 --> 02:33:09.355]  You want answers?
[02:33:09.676 --> 02:33:10.717]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:11.738 --> 02:33:15.603]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:19.827 --> 02:33:33.593]  You know, did you know that they're just out in the open now going, oh yeah, we are spraying aluminum dioxide and barium salts all over the world since the mid-1990s in a secret global geoengineering program.
[02:33:34.033 --> 02:33:41.476]  You can see it CBS News, ABC News, you can go to YouTube, type in John P. Holdren geoengineering, watch press conferences.
[02:33:42.276 --> 02:33:48.959]  What did all the chemtrail experts, Jim Keith was writing about this in like 92, before I was even on the scene.
[02:33:49.699 --> 02:33:51.540]  But the government says they started in the mid-nineties.
[02:33:51.560 --> 02:33:52.681]  That's when it got widespread.
[02:33:53.381 --> 02:33:57.344]  And everything he said, barium, salt, aluminum dioxide, and they clearly killed him.
[02:33:57.364 --> 02:33:59.325]  That was a guy ahead of his time.
[02:34:00.126 --> 02:34:03.828]  Really knew what he was talking about, Mr. Keith.
[02:34:03.848 --> 02:34:11.413]  And when you look at this, you understand how incredible it is that there could be a 15-plus year secret program
[02:34:12.233 --> 02:34:16.237]  And we've got the patents where they add the barium salts, aluminum dioxide to the jet fuel.
[02:34:16.517 --> 02:34:17.999]  The airlines don't even know.
[02:34:18.539 --> 02:34:21.703]  Then the patent for the engines to disperse it.
[02:34:22.163 --> 02:34:25.847]  And then the cover is, we're saving the earth from the sun's rays.
[02:34:26.607 --> 02:34:31.692]  Okay, so people 15 plus years ago tested it and said they're spraying aluminum.
[02:34:32.774 --> 02:34:38.398]  Uh, dioxide and barium salts on you and other things, and then now the government comes out and admits that.
[02:34:38.478 --> 02:34:46.303]  So, uh, we are selling a video that Jim McGriffin produced, it's very good, and is the first film to come out since they admitted a lot of this.
[02:34:46.603 --> 02:34:47.224]  This is huge!
[02:34:47.884 --> 02:34:48.484]  This is huge.
[02:34:48.884 --> 02:34:50.205]  Kim Trails admitted.
[02:34:50.625 --> 02:34:51.645]  What in the world were they spraying?
[02:34:51.665 --> 02:34:52.445]  It's the name of the film.
[02:34:52.905 --> 02:34:56.126]  It's available at InfoWars.com.
[02:34:56.926 --> 02:35:00.507]  We'll put it up on screen for folks so they can actually see it.
[02:35:00.547 --> 02:35:08.510]  But if you go to InfoWars.com and click on the shopping cart link there, it'll take you to the front page and you'll see the banner where you can buy it.
[02:35:08.770 --> 02:35:09.770]  If you want to get it first,
[02:35:10.510 --> 02:35:13.112]  You simply go to InfoWars.com and pre-order it.
[02:35:13.132 --> 02:35:16.834]  They'll be shipped out in the order they received starting October 22nd.
[02:35:17.034 --> 02:35:21.016]  And again, the name of the film is What in the World Are They Spraying?
[02:35:21.337 --> 02:35:23.018]  You can also call toll-free to get it.
[02:35:23.478 --> 02:35:23.718]  It's 888-253-3139.
[02:35:23.738 --> 02:35:23.778]  888-253-3139.
[02:35:23.798 --> 02:35:27.900]  And your purchase of the film also supports this operation, but also G. Edward Griffin and
[02:35:35.865 --> 02:35:38.167]  The filmmakers of What in the World Are They Spraying?
[02:35:38.467 --> 02:35:40.949]  The Chemtrail geoengineering cover-up revealed.
[02:35:40.969 --> 02:35:42.030]  888-253-3139 or write to us at P.O.
[02:35:42.070 --> 02:35:42.691]  Box 19549, Austin, TX 78760.
[02:35:42.731 --> 02:35:47.054]  Alright, now we're going back to the Health Ranger and one of my sales guys pointed this out.
[02:35:53.740 --> 02:35:57.364]  They go, you know, the Health Ranger really loves Interfood and it won their best superfood 2009.
[02:35:57.804 --> 02:36:02.368]  And so, you know, asking what he thinks about it, but I'm putting him on the spot here.
[02:36:02.689 --> 02:36:09.015]  But I remember about five years ago, I got some of this sent to me and I was so busy, I didn't even call them back because they wanted to be sponsors.
[02:36:09.736 --> 02:36:11.057]  But years later, we came back.
[02:36:11.397 --> 02:36:12.658]  My wife loves it.
[02:36:13.379 --> 02:36:21.021]  It's two little scoops in the morning in water or juice, you drink it, and it's 20 superfoods at once, and that way you absorb almost all of it.
[02:36:21.102 --> 02:36:27.544]  Even with the best vitamins and minerals, a lot of it gets passed through you, and you've got a lot of specials there on the site for Alex Jones listeners.
[02:36:28.444 --> 02:36:30.284]  Innerfood.com or 866-762-9238, 866-762-9238, innerfood.com.
[02:36:30.745 --> 02:36:32.945]  And give us your brief take on innerfood.
[02:36:41.843 --> 02:36:44.485]  I did give it an award, an Editor's Choice Award.
[02:36:44.826 --> 02:36:45.947]  It's the real thing.
[02:36:46.367 --> 02:36:49.129]  Not only is the product really great, but the company's great.
[02:36:49.209 --> 02:36:50.010]  The people there are great.
[02:36:50.150 --> 02:36:50.551]  They get it.
[02:36:51.331 --> 02:36:52.272]  They understand nutrition.
[02:36:52.352 --> 02:36:54.074]  They understand what's happening with the world.
[02:36:54.514 --> 02:36:56.356]  They want you to be nutritionally prepared.
[02:36:57.136 --> 02:36:58.437]  That's the bottom line with this product.
[02:36:59.298 --> 02:36:59.639]  I use it.
[02:37:00.336 --> 02:37:02.378]  Well, I know my wife gets upset when she runs out.
[02:37:02.919 --> 02:37:04.681]  Yeah, it's really that good.
[02:37:05.202 --> 02:37:06.823]  She's a lot more health conscious than I am.
[02:37:06.883 --> 02:37:07.684]  I mean, I try to be.
[02:37:07.925 --> 02:37:10.668]  Compared to the average American, I guess I'm okay, but I do have a lot of bad habits.
[02:37:11.048 --> 02:37:16.114]  But I noticed that when I first started taking it, I mean, it was almost like a drug or something.
[02:37:16.154 --> 02:37:21.160]  I mean, there's no speed, no caffeine in it, but it's almost like jolting to have real nutrients.
[02:37:21.460 --> 02:37:26.164]  It makes you alert without any kind of caffeine type of buzz.
[02:37:26.865 --> 02:37:28.026]  No stimulants whatsoever.
[02:37:28.066 --> 02:37:29.868]  It just basically clears out your system.
[02:37:30.789 --> 02:37:33.351]  And it makes your brain and body function better.
[02:37:33.631 --> 02:37:36.334]  You know, I mean, superfoods are really powerful for doing that.
[02:37:36.374 --> 02:37:39.797]  And with Interfood, he's combined a lot of the best ones in the world.
[02:37:40.638 --> 02:37:41.839]  I don't give out a lot of awards.
[02:37:42.079 --> 02:37:42.800]  You probably know that.
[02:37:43.500 --> 02:37:46.003]  And the key is they don't pasteurize it either, so it doesn't lose the...
[02:37:46.423 --> 02:37:47.244]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:37:47.704 --> 02:37:48.144]  Exactly.
[02:37:48.205 --> 02:37:50.546]  So you've got the nutrients that are destroyed by heat.
[02:37:51.387 --> 02:37:53.008]  In inner food, they're not destroyed.
[02:37:53.649 --> 02:37:54.369]  They're intact.
[02:37:54.610 --> 02:37:55.590]  And that makes all the difference.
[02:37:55.871 --> 02:37:56.391]  Absolutely.
[02:37:56.451 --> 02:37:56.751]  Okay.
[02:37:57.112 --> 02:37:58.673]  Let's get back into the salmon.
[02:38:00.114 --> 02:38:02.156]  Because the FDA admits this is a major change.
[02:38:02.256 --> 02:38:03.317]  They're now getting ready to approve
[02:38:04.667 --> 02:38:04.967]  I don't
[02:38:25.262 --> 02:38:28.325]  Monsanto had their genetically engineered growth hormone in the milk.
[02:38:28.665 --> 02:38:34.390]  They tried to sue non-GMO milk makers for just saying we're GMO free.
[02:38:34.650 --> 02:38:39.655]  Like, how dare you in America put on a container that you don't have artificial hormones?
[02:38:39.675 --> 02:38:40.635]  How dare you?
[02:38:41.136 --> 02:38:41.776]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:38:41.917 --> 02:38:45.079]  And that's the kind of outrage that we should all be expressing on this issue.
[02:38:45.520 --> 02:38:45.880]  They did.
[02:38:46.220 --> 02:38:49.864]  They want you to be not just uninformed, but misinformed.
[02:38:50.484 --> 02:38:57.270]  Because the more you know about GMOs, the more concerned you should be about eating them yourself or feeding them to your children or family members.
[02:38:57.831 --> 02:39:03.996]  And right now in the US, 91% of the soybean fields are genetically modified soy.
[02:39:04.657 --> 02:39:10.882]  We have GMO sugar beets creating genetically modified sugar in this country, and that's not labeled either.
[02:39:11.263 --> 02:39:12.504]  All kinds of GMO corn.
[02:39:13.004 --> 02:39:14.285]  Being used in the food supply.
[02:39:14.325 --> 02:39:19.667]  And every week or two I see a headline, GMO corn caused organ failure in rats.
[02:39:19.747 --> 02:39:21.427]  I mean, it's just, it's constant.
[02:39:21.987 --> 02:39:23.508]  Yeah, there have been a lot of animal studies.
[02:39:23.548 --> 02:39:30.531]  You know, Jeffrey Smith is one of the best experts on this and he's really studied the issue and he will tell you how dangerous this can be.
[02:39:30.551 --> 02:39:38.194]  I mean, we should be concerned, not only because we're not being told the truth, but also because the testing hasn't been done.
[02:39:38.914 --> 02:39:46.040]  Have these salmon, these genetically engineered salmon, have they ever really been tested on humans as a food source?
[02:39:46.200 --> 02:39:46.940]  The answer is no.
[02:39:47.321 --> 02:39:48.261]  And they're not about to be.
[02:39:48.762 --> 02:39:51.023]  Now, Alex, this could unleash the floodgates.
[02:39:51.684 --> 02:39:58.429]  If the FDA allows GMO salmon into the food supply, they could allow any genetically engineered animal.
[02:39:59.330 --> 02:40:05.255]  I mean, it could be fish, it could be genetically modified cows, pigs, chickens, or some animal that we haven't even thought of yet.
[02:40:05.715 --> 02:40:06.576]  Something they create.
[02:40:07.369 --> 02:40:11.190]  You know, they're going to play Frankenfood with animals now and approve that as a foodstuff.
[02:40:11.230 --> 02:40:31.818]  And I've had top scientists on the show, world-renowned, who ran whole biotech companies and morally said, I can't do this, in one case a potato in England, and they found you can change that one trait to make it taste better, last longer, whatever they're looking for, but then it randomly changes thousands of other things and then as they
[02:40:32.398 --> 02:40:36.259]  And let's talk about why this really matters because if you get
[02:40:58.783 --> 02:41:06.610]  The corn crops and the wheat crops and the soy crops all contaminated with these genetically engineered DNA.
[02:41:07.171 --> 02:41:13.497]  Then you could have a susceptibility to a widespread viral infection throughout the crop.
[02:41:14.438 --> 02:41:16.039]  A plague of the crops, right?
[02:41:16.700 --> 02:41:19.702]  That could wipe out our crops in one season.
[02:41:19.842 --> 02:41:22.185]  It's that genetic diversity that stopped that.
[02:41:22.805 --> 02:41:23.246]  Exactly.
[02:41:23.506 --> 02:41:37.880]  So I think that these scientists, by playing God with the food supply, developing these frankenfoods, they are setting us up for future famine, starvation, crop failures that could just devastate global population.
[02:41:38.080 --> 02:41:41.543]  I mean, they've always wanted to reduce Africa, Latin America, and Asia's population.
[02:41:41.583 --> 02:41:42.224]  That's on record.
[02:41:42.645 --> 02:41:56.018]  Once they get them to accept this, and 90 plus percent of, say, their corn is GMO, it gets wiped out, they're deader than a hammer, and then they don't have the seed stocks, and they admit this is a military-style takeover of the planet.
[02:41:56.038 --> 02:41:58.500]  I mean, here's a quick example of trusting these people.
[02:41:58.540 --> 02:41:59.682]  This is just today.
[02:42:00.222 --> 02:42:03.524]  Okay, you have to understand, every day this is in the news.
[02:42:03.544 --> 02:42:04.285]  They even admit it!
[02:42:04.645 --> 02:42:05.345]  Here's CNN.
[02:42:05.486 --> 02:42:05.726]  U.S.
[02:42:05.766 --> 02:42:10.329]  apologizes for infecting Guatemalans with STDs in the 1940s.
[02:42:10.689 --> 02:42:12.730]  They always report something, you know, 50 years old.
[02:42:13.451 --> 02:42:20.976]  The United States apologized Friday for a 1946-48 study that purposefully infected people in Guatemala with sexually transmitted diseases.
[02:42:21.376 --> 02:42:27.140]  A statement by the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Secretary of Human Services Kathleen Sebelius called the action reprehensible.
[02:42:28.271 --> 02:42:33.775]  And it goes on to how they told him it was health clinics and injected them with syphilis and other things.
[02:42:36.797 --> 02:42:39.899]  And we know that they had cancer viruses in the polio shots.
[02:42:40.339 --> 02:42:44.502]  Every year I see articles about people being killed by the polio shots they're being given now.
[02:42:44.522 --> 02:42:46.443]  And it's like, oops, it was live.
[02:42:46.503 --> 02:42:47.744]  It was a weaponized strain.
[02:42:47.764 --> 02:42:52.428]  Oops, now everybody better take the vaccine we've got or you'll die.
[02:42:52.508 --> 02:42:54.689]  And then suddenly their fertility goes down.
[02:42:54.949 --> 02:42:56.971]  And we have the Rockefeller Foundation reports
[02:42:57.671 --> 02:43:00.952]  That our researchers and writers have been doing a great job digging through.
[02:43:01.032 --> 02:43:06.613]  One great guy over in the Netherlands, he's publishing articles multiple times a week, where, you know, I always think I know it all.
[02:43:07.433 --> 02:43:08.893]  And then I realize how much I don't know.
[02:43:09.934 --> 02:43:19.336]  We literally have found hundreds of Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, UN reports, where they said, we're going to add this hormone to the tetanus shot, sterilize people.
[02:43:19.416 --> 02:43:20.616]  Then we have them caught doing it.
[02:43:20.936 --> 02:43:23.399]  We're gonna put cancer viruses in the polio.
[02:43:23.419 --> 02:43:28.624]  I mean, they did it all, and that's who killed your grandma, folks.
[02:43:28.664 --> 02:43:29.725]  That's who killed your grandpa.
[02:43:30.346 --> 02:43:37.093]  And they know what they're doing, and now they've gotten to a point, in the past they would deny all this, now they just come out and say, hey,
[02:43:37.754 --> 02:43:38.594]  Depleted uranium?
[02:43:38.714 --> 02:43:39.415]  Not bad for you.
[02:43:39.535 --> 02:43:40.595]  They know it's going to kill the troops?
[02:43:40.635 --> 02:43:42.116]  Not bad for you.
[02:43:42.896 --> 02:43:46.377]  They now have 500 mobile radiation vans just driving around beaming people.
[02:43:46.617 --> 02:43:49.278]  Can you speak from your deep research?
[02:43:49.798 --> 02:43:55.160]  I mean, do you agree with me that we have the facts that this is totally staged by design?
[02:43:55.180 --> 02:43:56.601]  I mean, they are trying to kill us.
[02:43:57.101 --> 02:44:02.225]  Well, it's very clear, actually, the history of medical experimentation on the human race.
[02:44:02.245 --> 02:44:08.289]  I mean, I published a timeline of that at one point that tracks it, all the events throughout U.S.
[02:44:08.309 --> 02:44:09.270]  history, just U.S.
[02:44:09.290 --> 02:44:09.610]  history.
[02:44:10.290 --> 02:44:12.432]  Most of those experiments involved the military.
[02:44:12.972 --> 02:44:15.394]  And they would experiment on certain groups.
[02:44:15.554 --> 02:44:20.158]  African Americans, or prisoners, or people of low economic status, typically.
[02:44:20.699 --> 02:44:22.200]  They would pick certain groups.
[02:44:22.240 --> 02:44:23.661]  They would conduct experiments on them.
[02:44:23.681 --> 02:44:24.722]  And these are all well documented.
[02:44:24.742 --> 02:44:26.984]  This isn't, you know, just pie-in-the-sky stuff.
[02:44:27.004 --> 02:44:28.766]  This is all extremely well documented.
[02:44:29.446 --> 02:44:35.048]  And many of these researchers later were found out and they were stripped of their licenses and so on.
[02:44:35.128 --> 02:44:37.989]  I mean, this stuff, it came out eventually.
[02:44:38.029 --> 02:44:40.750]  But like you said, 50 years later is usually the case.
[02:44:41.351 --> 02:44:41.931]  But they did.
[02:44:42.371 --> 02:44:46.173]  I mean, they sprayed the population in California with bioweapons.
[02:44:46.613 --> 02:44:48.473]  I mean, this goes on all the time.
[02:44:48.734 --> 02:44:51.775]  And they will tell you later only if they get caught.
[02:44:52.555 --> 02:44:54.897]  But it's happening right now with the vaccines.
[02:44:55.738 --> 02:44:57.500]  H1N1, swine flu vaccine.
[02:44:57.940 --> 02:45:06.888]  The evidence now says that those who were vaccinated against swine flu now are at greater risk of catching the next seasonal flu.
[02:45:07.168 --> 02:45:08.830]  So it actually weakens your immune system.
[02:45:09.150 --> 02:45:15.956]  That's mainstream news, and you said all this over a year ago when it was happening, and now the British Medical Journal's come out and said it was a fraud, it's dangerous.
[02:45:16.276 --> 02:45:19.920]  They've suspended the flu shots in England ten times the convulsions.
[02:45:20.680 --> 02:45:23.483]  Other countries, narcolepsy.
[02:45:23.763 --> 02:45:25.244]  I mean, this stuff's frying your brain.
[02:45:25.545 --> 02:45:26.045]  Absolutely.
[02:45:26.125 --> 02:45:29.848]  It's a nervous system aggravating
[02:45:30.569 --> 02:45:31.110]  Injection.
[02:45:31.670 --> 02:45:32.731]  It's bad for your brain.
[02:45:32.751 --> 02:45:34.032]  It's bad for your nervous system.
[02:45:34.472 --> 02:45:35.793]  And it's bad for your immune system.
[02:45:35.833 --> 02:45:37.935]  It makes you more susceptible to a future flu.
[02:45:38.655 --> 02:45:50.525]  In fact, this brings me back to the Bill Gates quote, which is, you know, he says, one way to reduce, or if we do a good job on vaccines and health care, he says, we could reduce the world population by 10 to 15 percent.
[02:45:50.625 --> 02:45:51.566]  That's pretty close.
[02:45:51.606 --> 02:45:53.927]  Here's your article today from Natural News.
[02:45:53.967 --> 02:45:54.348]  Here it is.
[02:45:54.368 --> 02:45:54.868]  Okay, right.
[02:45:55.309 --> 02:45:56.269]  So that's, here's, yeah.
[02:45:57.310 --> 02:46:09.177]  He says, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that, which he's talking about the world population, by perhaps 10 to 15 percent.
[02:46:09.517 --> 02:46:11.519]  Well, how do you lower the population with vaccines?
[02:46:12.617 --> 02:46:21.123]  You weaken people's immune systems, you make them more susceptible to future infections, and then you just wait for something to come along, or you introduce something.
[02:46:21.143 --> 02:46:21.943]  They have a word for it.
[02:46:21.984 --> 02:46:23.424]  This is called a binary weapon.
[02:46:24.085 --> 02:46:24.705]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:46:25.006 --> 02:46:25.206]  Right.
[02:46:25.446 --> 02:46:26.807]  You've got to have both elements in place.
[02:46:26.967 --> 02:46:30.689]  One of them could be a wild virus, but the first element is the vaccine.
[02:46:30.710 --> 02:46:32.911]  Well, now we're learning stuff in vaccines.
[02:46:32.991 --> 02:46:37.234]  Viruses and RNA is one of the things triggering Americans to be more obese.
[02:46:37.274 --> 02:46:38.275]  Not just the diet,
[02:46:39.015 --> 02:46:43.416]  It's that we're eating all this GMO and we're being shot up with these vaccines that are just frying us.
[02:46:44.116 --> 02:46:50.878]  I think that there is an effort to disease-ify, if I could use that made-up word, to disease-ify America.
[02:46:51.258 --> 02:46:51.878]  And it's working!
[02:46:51.898 --> 02:46:52.598]  It's a pestilence.
[02:46:52.918 --> 02:46:53.239]  It is.
[02:46:53.679 --> 02:47:06.942]  Because they know that most Americans, they're going to spend every last dollar and they're going to give up their freedoms to try to save their lives if they're promised some kind of... Yeah, these soft-kill weapons, and I've actually seen the studies,
[02:47:07.742 --> 02:47:13.644]  It's designed, the stuff they're shooting you in vaccines are RNA packages, literally nanotech they've designed.
[02:47:13.824 --> 02:47:15.585]  That's what a virus is, it's natural nanotech.
[02:47:16.245 --> 02:47:18.386]  They argue, is it alive, you know, or isn't it?
[02:47:18.646 --> 02:47:29.090]  But the point is, it's like a computer program that the viruses get into your cells' DNA and mitochondrial, and it's designed that when your hormones drop,
[02:47:29.770 --> 02:47:40.018]  Right around the time you're leaving work, right around the time that your body's starting to shut down to die over the next 20 years, we have that design clock in us, that's when the virus is triggered.
[02:47:40.158 --> 02:47:46.202]  So they discovered in the 20s, the Rockefeller Foundation, and I have all their documents on this, what's so crazy, that they know then
[02:47:47.623 --> 02:47:58.133]  In their hormone test that, okay, you're done working, you've gone to menopause, or your testosterone's down, you're past 60, now that's when this stuff gets triggered, and then you get cancer and die.
[02:47:58.173 --> 02:47:59.894]  I mean, it's so diabolical.
[02:48:00.455 --> 02:48:02.537]  And that's when you're going to spend the most money on healthcare.
[02:48:02.677 --> 02:48:04.378]  Yeah, all your money you've saved goes to them.
[02:48:04.538 --> 02:48:04.898]  Exactly.
[02:48:04.918 --> 02:48:09.501]  You work your whole life, and you end up spending every last penny dying, suffering, and broke.
[02:48:10.102 --> 02:48:12.803]  Because chemotherapy creates a lot of suffering.
[02:48:13.103 --> 02:48:13.664]  Think about this.
[02:48:14.024 --> 02:48:18.487]  When people go out and they think they're raising money for cancer research, you know, these pink ribbon runs.
[02:48:19.407 --> 02:48:20.408]  Let's raise money for cancer.
[02:48:21.028 --> 02:48:33.450]  Most of that money goes to these mammogram, they have trucks with these portable radiation mammogram machines that will drive out to low-income areas of a major city and they will radiate.
[02:48:33.970 --> 02:48:35.971]  They will irradiate women's breasts.
[02:48:35.991 --> 02:48:44.032]  And they admit now it's increasing cancer, but imagine no one would ever think that in the name of fighting cancer they're out there spreading it.
[02:48:44.072 --> 02:48:44.632]  They're causing it.
[02:48:44.712 --> 02:48:46.813]  That's what's so genius about these people.
[02:48:46.913 --> 02:48:48.313]  No one could ever imagine that.
[02:48:48.513 --> 02:48:49.094]  Well, they'll go out.
[02:48:49.194 --> 02:48:52.457]  They will specifically target, let's say, African-American neighborhoods.
[02:48:53.158 --> 02:48:56.801]  And they will essentially give breast cancer to these women.
[02:48:57.322 --> 02:49:02.727]  And then, because they know that these women, when they have... Well, they now admit ultrasounds brain-damaging babies.
[02:49:02.747 --> 02:49:03.368]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:49:03.508 --> 02:49:04.609]  Oh no, you're exactly right.
[02:49:04.909 --> 02:49:10.996]  I mean, most of these screening procedures are actually causing the very diseases that they claim to detect.
[02:49:11.755 --> 02:49:19.738]  But they know that an African-American woman who is given breast cancer through mammography is a cash cow, so to speak.
[02:49:19.818 --> 02:49:22.039]  I mean, I don't mean anything derogatory by that term.
[02:49:22.079 --> 02:49:22.679]  That's their term.
[02:49:23.019 --> 02:49:25.540]  They look at that woman as a walking ATM.
[02:49:25.880 --> 02:49:27.261]  They can extract money from her.
[02:49:28.163 --> 02:49:30.344]  With up to a million dollars in cancer.
[02:49:30.364 --> 02:49:33.666]  And the more funding they put into fighting breast cancer, the more it happens.
[02:49:33.786 --> 02:49:34.306]  Exactly.
[02:49:34.746 --> 02:49:39.248]  When you donate to breast cancer by buying pink products, this is an insane idea.
[02:49:39.569 --> 02:49:41.630]  You think you can cure cancer by going shopping?
[02:49:42.190 --> 02:49:42.630]  Come on!
[02:49:43.070 --> 02:49:43.731]  That doesn't work.
[02:49:44.471 --> 02:49:47.032]  This money goes to actually causing more breast cancer.
[02:49:47.172 --> 02:49:48.633]  In fact, guys, people won't believe that.
[02:49:49.113 --> 02:49:52.315]  Search the term, study shows mammograms increase cancer.
[02:49:53.047 --> 02:49:54.207]  And it's like mainstream news.
[02:49:54.508 --> 02:49:55.448]  Well, it's radiation.
[02:49:56.728 --> 02:50:07.432]  The story that I often reference on our site is that 10 women are harmed by mammography for every one woman that's actually helped, where they actually detect a tumor early.
[02:50:07.472 --> 02:50:10.673]  And a lot of times they find, like my grandmother, they said, you've got lung cancer.
[02:50:10.894 --> 02:50:12.734]  When they chopped her lung out, it wasn't cancer.
[02:50:12.954 --> 02:50:14.675]  It was a broken blood vessel that had made a clot.
[02:50:14.895 --> 02:50:15.776]  It's very often the case.
[02:50:15.816 --> 02:50:17.136]  There's a lot of false diagnosis.
[02:50:17.256 --> 02:50:19.338]  And then that ended up basically soft killing her.
[02:50:19.358 --> 02:50:21.599]  I mean, she had a hellish life for the last 10 years of her life.
[02:50:22.079 --> 02:50:27.562]  Well, you know, radiation and poison and cutting people open, this should not be called medicine, Alex.
[02:50:28.163 --> 02:50:33.746]  This, this is really a war against the American people framed inside the context.
[02:50:34.326 --> 02:50:36.128]  That's what I figured out, not just from the documents.
[02:50:36.168 --> 02:50:43.375]  I'm realizing the cell phones, the mobile trucks that are 10 times the chest x-ray, the naked body scanners, all the scientists saying it's deadly.
[02:50:43.575 --> 02:50:45.416]  They now tell the workers just go up and run it.
[02:50:46.017 --> 02:50:53.224]  They are, just like the Pentagon radiated 4,000 foster children to death, they're now radiating all of us and their own troops.
[02:50:53.264 --> 02:50:56.627]  We're all being murdered by the eugenicists and Bill Gates right now.
[02:50:56.687 --> 02:50:57.268]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:04.446 --> 02:51:05.507]  Afraid to answer it?
[02:51:06.408 --> 02:51:07.870]  Afraid to answer your door?
[02:51:08.311 --> 02:51:15.319]  Did you know that debt settlement, bankruptcy, and attorneys will cost you about 10 times more than you would legally be required to pay creditors?
[02:51:15.599 --> 02:51:17.642]  These are not ways to help you get out of debt.
[02:51:17.822 --> 02:51:19.604]  They are expensive payment plans.
[02:51:19.844 --> 02:51:23.148]  And if you're in debt already, does it make sense to load yourself up with
[02:51:23.148 --> 02:51:23.669]  We're good to go.

[02:52:03.792 --> 02:52:04.733]  Tyranny is here.
[02:52:05.073 --> 02:52:08.736]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:52:08.936 --> 02:52:11.218]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:52:11.238 --> 02:52:16.682]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:52:17.102 --> 02:52:23.327]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:52:23.747 --> 02:52:29.291]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:52:29.731 --> 02:52:33.414]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:52:33.914 --> 02:52:37.897]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.

[02:52:44.142 --> 02:52:47.144]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:52:47.704 --> 02:52:49.145]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:52:49.685 --> 02:52:50.106]  It's here.

[02:52:58.549 --> 02:52:59.690]  This may surprise you.
[02:52:59.910 --> 02:53:04.111]  Type 2 diabetes has reached epidemic proportions among both adults and children.
[02:53:04.391 --> 02:53:06.012]  You or someone you know may have it.
[02:53:06.212 --> 02:53:09.795]  Managing type 2 diabetes in conventional ways is a never-ending task.
[02:53:09.955 --> 02:53:12.277]  But this good news may also surprise you.
[02:53:12.517 --> 02:53:17.842]  A recent UCLA study proved that type 2 diabetes can be reversed in only 21 days.
[02:53:18.062 --> 02:53:23.647]  Puriam Health Products recently developed a product that mimics the healthy diet used in that UCLA study.
[02:53:23.747 --> 02:53:30.733]  Called Scoop of Greens, an easy, great tasting, affordable way to give your body the nutritional tools to help it overcome type 2 diabetes.
[02:53:30.993 --> 02:53:35.637]  Scoop of Greens has been awarded the Diabetes Resource Center Seal of Approval so you know it's safe.

[02:54:04.298 --> 02:54:06.859]  I'm gonna state it again, if you're a new listener.
[02:54:08.659 --> 02:54:17.302]  There are over 10,000 declassified reports, this is in my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, of U.S.
[02:54:17.362 --> 02:54:27.466]  populations, blacks, Hispanics, the military, they really hate the military, being radiated, foster children being put in chambers and fried like eggs.
[02:54:28.621 --> 02:54:31.844]  I mean, they would kill them instantly or they'd give them lower dosage.
[02:54:32.504 --> 02:54:41.332]  They paid the Israeli government to irradiate 110,000 Sephardic children who are seen as lower class because they're dark-skinned.
[02:54:42.814 --> 02:54:44.035]  That's all covered in an endgame.
[02:54:44.055 --> 02:54:49.520]  I mean, all these governments are doing this to create cadres of scientists that will kill people.
[02:54:50.280 --> 02:54:53.562]  And we got secret Marine Corps reports from the Sunshine Project.
[02:54:53.582 --> 02:54:55.044]  They made a big fracas 10 years ago.
[02:54:55.104 --> 02:54:55.844]  They had to remove them.
[02:54:56.124 --> 02:54:56.965]  But we've covered them here.
[02:54:57.425 --> 02:55:00.808]  And they're still at the Google Wayback Machine archive.
[02:55:01.588 --> 02:55:03.730]  People can still find them even though the Marine Corps ordered them down.
[02:55:04.450 --> 02:55:13.156]  Where they have plans in every major city with knockout gases, but also kill gases, and helicopters in armored facilities.
[02:55:13.617 --> 02:55:14.717]  And now they're moving to drones.
[02:55:14.777 --> 02:55:16.999]  So if the pilots refuse, it won't matter.
[02:55:17.199 --> 02:55:18.620]  That are ready to take off.
[02:55:18.680 --> 02:55:19.241]  I'm not kidding.
[02:55:19.921 --> 02:55:23.224]  Take off and knock out entire cities or kill entire cities.
[02:55:23.504 --> 02:55:26.726]  Now, folks, you cannot make this stuff up.
[02:55:27.227 --> 02:55:33.271]  And that's why they're going to a full drone air force where, you know, somebody like Dick Cheney in the future, Dr. Evil, can just hit the button.
[02:55:34.192 --> 02:55:35.073]  We're not joking.
[02:55:35.353 --> 02:55:46.702]  Why would you take any vaccines or any GMO food that they pitch at you when this is their stated plan to kill you but kill you slowly and suck all of your money out of you in the process?
[02:55:47.462 --> 02:55:50.105]  Mike Adams, you're going to be with us for 40 minutes to the next hour.
[02:55:50.125 --> 02:55:52.426]  Then I'm going to blitz news the last 20 minutes.
[02:55:52.767 --> 02:55:53.647]  This is a short segment.
[02:55:53.848 --> 02:55:55.889]  But you've covered the GMO salmon.
[02:55:55.909 --> 02:55:57.951]  You've got a bunch of other issues you want to get into.
[02:55:58.171 --> 02:55:58.391]  Hit it.
[02:55:59.512 --> 02:56:04.416]  Federal Trade Commission, earlier this week, went after the Palm Wonderful Company.
[02:56:04.596 --> 02:56:06.818]  This is the company that makes the pomegranate juice.
[02:56:08.379 --> 02:56:11.702]  We've documented many of the health benefits of pomegranate juice.
[02:56:11.742 --> 02:56:13.684]  And by the way, I don't have any financial ties with that company.
[02:56:14.044 --> 02:56:14.665]  Just reporting it.
[02:56:15.705 --> 02:56:17.826]  Pomegranate juice prevents prostate cancer.
[02:56:18.487 --> 02:56:19.887]  It helps prevent heart disease.
[02:56:19.907 --> 02:56:24.870]  It is a fantastic natural medicine from pomegranate seeds.
[02:56:24.950 --> 02:56:25.810]  It's very powerful.
[02:56:25.850 --> 02:56:28.311]  We're supposed to eat food, and food is medicine.
[02:56:28.711 --> 02:56:29.412]  That's exactly it.
[02:56:29.972 --> 02:56:31.653]  Well, the FTC takes an issue.
[02:56:32.153 --> 02:56:38.278]  With the fact that this company is telling people the truth about some of the health benefits of pomegranates.
[02:56:38.738 --> 02:56:43.381]  And they are now claiming that this company is really engaging in criminal activity.
[02:56:43.782 --> 02:56:49.646]  And the FTC has done this in many cases, many times, with other companies, natural product companies.
[02:56:50.247 --> 02:56:53.389]  And they have forced them, they've threatened them with criminal prosecution.
[02:56:53.709 --> 02:56:56.772]  And they have forced them to sign what are called consent decrees.
[02:56:57.532 --> 02:56:58.212]  And I've seen these.
[02:56:58.252 --> 02:57:00.073]  I've had companies send them to me covertly.
[02:57:00.093 --> 02:57:04.516]  They didn't want to be on the air, but they would send them to me because they want me to know what's in these.
[02:57:05.116 --> 02:57:11.600]  And in these consent decrees, there is language that says you must admit to committing these crimes.
[02:57:12.100 --> 02:57:15.022]  And the crimes are the crimes you never even committed.
[02:57:15.402 --> 02:57:17.923]  They are that you have been trafficking in drugs.
[02:57:19.404 --> 02:57:24.590]  Because you see, they can consider the pomegranates to be a drug according to the FDA's definition.
[02:57:24.610 --> 02:57:30.657]  No, I've seen SWAT team raids on people growing just regular herbs, things like aloe vera.
[02:57:31.297 --> 02:57:32.038]  Oh yeah, sure.
[02:57:32.238 --> 02:57:34.581]  I mean, these government agencies get crazy.
[02:57:34.781 --> 02:57:43.785]  When you start telling people the truth about something that can prevent disease, because remember, you're denying revenue to the pharmaceutical industrial complex.
[02:57:43.805 --> 02:57:45.065]  Which is the Rockefeller Mafia.
[02:57:45.345 --> 02:57:46.006]  Exactly.
[02:57:46.366 --> 02:57:49.467]  So if you start costing them money, the government's going to come after you.
[02:57:49.867 --> 02:57:59.071]  And they can do that either through the FTC or the FDA, sometimes the USDA, although I got to give the USDA credit for their organic labeling program, that's actually a really good program.
[02:57:59.431 --> 02:58:00.692]  They've done a good job with that element.
[02:58:01.212 --> 02:58:07.620]  But overall, the government is attacking and destroying natural health and natural product companies.
[02:58:08.061 --> 02:58:13.508]  And now they're really going after the family farms with these Senate bills, saying you can't pick peaches and sell them.
[02:58:14.372 --> 02:58:16.293]  Right, these food safety bills.
[02:58:16.873 --> 02:58:21.554]  These could turn thousands of farmers across America into criminals.
[02:58:22.174 --> 02:58:24.775]  And these are the people who are growing the food we're trying to get locally.
[02:58:25.195 --> 02:58:28.756]  You know, these are the ones growing the non-GMO food that we need to be eating.
[02:58:29.476 --> 02:58:30.997]  And these are the people being targeted.
[02:58:31.017 --> 02:58:32.737]  Alright, Mike, stay there.
[02:58:32.797 --> 02:58:35.078]  We're coming back live in the fourth hour.
[02:58:35.098 --> 02:58:37.518]  It is Friday, October 1st.

[03:00:24.594 --> 03:00:25.254]  I'm not here for that.
[03:00:25.674 --> 03:00:26.415]  But I'm going to plug them.

[03:00:30.958 --> 03:00:33.280]  Mike Adams, America's number one consumer health advocate.
[03:00:34.020 --> 03:00:36.101]  Those are available at naturalnews.com.
[03:00:37.162 --> 03:00:42.566]  Spam filters for your brain to navigate through the lies, hype, and mind games of food, drug, and cosmetic industries.
[03:00:43.046 --> 03:00:45.888]  Mike Adams, all available at his website.
[03:00:46.108 --> 03:00:48.910]  I think I ought to carry your books and videos at...
[03:00:49.930 --> 03:00:53.693]  Infowars.com because I know they're amongst the best research out there.
[03:00:53.713 --> 03:01:01.580]  We do have Mr. Smith's material dealing with the genetic roulette and all the GMO and the rest of it.
[03:01:01.640 --> 03:01:02.941]  Now, this is a short segment.
[03:01:02.981 --> 03:01:05.082]  I want to fire the phone number out for listeners.
[03:01:05.543 --> 03:01:10.026]  If you have a question or a comment for Mike Adams, you won't need those headphones yet.
[03:01:11.349 --> 03:01:12.531]  We'll go to calls in about 10 minutes.
[03:01:12.551 --> 03:01:12.891]  1-800-259-9231.
[03:01:12.911 --> 03:01:13.051]  1-800-259-9231.
[03:01:13.091 --> 03:01:15.554]  Specifically on all these major health issues that we are talking about.
[03:01:15.574 --> 03:01:18.858]  But they really are, Mike, trying to bully us into saying, OK, radiate me.
[03:01:30.030 --> 03:01:30.891]  Uh, at checkpoints.
[03:01:31.051 --> 03:01:33.172]  Okay, don't let me know I'm eating GMO.
[03:01:33.473 --> 03:01:40.517]  Okay, shut down a company that shows the mainline studies that palm granite is just full of incredible antioxidants and all this other stuff in it.
[03:01:40.898 --> 03:01:44.280]  But you've got a bunch of other issues that dovetail with that.
[03:01:44.720 --> 03:01:48.323]  Meanwhile, they're saying, feed babies GMO soy that's half sugar.
[03:01:49.406 --> 03:01:52.468]  Okay, yeah, a lot of people heard about the product.
[03:01:52.508 --> 03:01:56.751]  It was a voluntary recall by the maker of infant formula called Similac.
[03:01:57.211 --> 03:02:00.013]  Here is a product shot right here, Similac.
[03:02:00.874 --> 03:02:07.358]  And the company said, well, some of the containers may have beetles or beetle larvae in them.
[03:02:08.018 --> 03:02:09.539]  And I got to thinking, well, what else is in there?
[03:02:10.922 --> 03:02:13.743]  I'm not sure that the beetles are the most dangerous thing in the can.
[03:02:13.763 --> 03:02:15.343]  That might be the only good thing in there.
[03:02:16.404 --> 03:02:17.484]  The bugs are actually pretty good.
[03:02:17.804 --> 03:02:20.065]  The only nutritious thing in it is the beetles.
[03:02:20.745 --> 03:02:24.206]  It's kind of like the prize in a Cracker Jack box is the beetle.
[03:02:24.726 --> 03:02:25.506]  Oh, something edible.
[03:02:25.746 --> 03:02:26.186]  Exactly.
[03:02:26.666 --> 03:02:28.387]  Living food, right?
[03:02:29.107 --> 03:02:31.868]  Anyway, I bought this and I took a look at the ingredients label.
[03:02:32.228 --> 03:02:33.409]  And it just shocked me, Alex.
[03:02:33.469 --> 03:02:34.250]  It freaked me out.
[03:02:34.690 --> 03:02:36.171]  And I've seen a lot of crazy foods.
[03:02:36.651 --> 03:02:41.615]  But this label says, look at the number one ingredient on here.
[03:02:41.635 --> 03:02:43.036]  42.6% corn syrup solids.
[03:02:43.116 --> 03:02:43.896]  That's number one.
[03:02:44.096 --> 03:02:46.758]  But that's what a baby needs, is 42.6% corn syrup.
[03:02:46.798 --> 03:02:50.041]  Because everybody knows how good corn syrup is.
[03:02:50.281 --> 03:02:51.742]  What are you, some kind of conspiracy theorist?
[03:02:52.122 --> 03:02:52.642]  I guess so.
[03:02:53.262 --> 03:02:58.104]  And, on top of that, 10.1% sucrose, which is essentially table sugar.
[03:02:58.124 --> 03:02:59.664]  Well, you wonder why the public's so dumb.
[03:02:59.684 --> 03:03:01.065]  They've been getting fed this for decades.
[03:03:01.365 --> 03:03:03.045]  I talk to people and they're like zombies.
[03:03:03.966 --> 03:03:06.667]  Pretty soon, if you can tie your shoelaces, you'll be a rocket scientist.
[03:03:06.947 --> 03:03:07.567]  And here's the kicker.
[03:03:07.867 --> 03:03:14.529]  This formula, as far as I know, and I asked around, but this formula is covered under state WIC programs.
[03:03:15.049 --> 03:03:17.510]  So you can use government money to feed your baby this
[03:03:17.810 --> 03:03:19.031]  Well, notice how they incentivize.
[03:03:19.051 --> 03:03:24.693]  You only have money, 43 million Americans, on the food stamps, but it's only good for this.
[03:03:25.233 --> 03:03:25.874]  Well, exactly.
[03:03:26.194 --> 03:03:28.975]  You will feed them 42.6% corn syrup.
[03:03:29.015 --> 03:03:29.175]  Yep.
[03:03:29.535 --> 03:03:34.357]  Oh, and also what else is in here is soy protein.
[03:03:34.517 --> 03:03:34.958]  It's 14.7%.
[03:03:35.358 --> 03:03:36.758]  Doesn't that have estrogen mimickers?
[03:03:37.459 --> 03:03:45.983]  Well, there was a study done by Consumer Reports back in 99 on this brand that found evidence that it's genetically modified soy.
[03:03:47.043 --> 03:03:49.145]  And you notice there's no label that says non-GMO.
[03:03:50.406 --> 03:03:51.407]  Well, that would be evil.
[03:03:51.707 --> 03:03:51.887]  Right.
[03:03:52.568 --> 03:03:54.029]  You're not allowed to know what's in there.
[03:03:54.169 --> 03:03:56.231]  You think you're in a free country, pal?
[03:03:56.632 --> 03:03:57.392]  This is what our babies need.
[03:03:57.412 --> 03:03:58.954]  This is for our poor children.
[03:03:59.334 --> 03:04:02.577]  A baby needs 42.6% corn syrup in their diet.
[03:04:02.617 --> 03:04:03.318]  Come on, man.
[03:04:03.378 --> 03:04:03.878]  It's crazy.
[03:04:04.158 --> 03:04:04.639]  It's insane.
[03:04:04.739 --> 03:04:07.742]  I mean, next they'll say, hey, just give babies Coca-Cola.
[03:04:08.282 --> 03:04:09.823]  Well, remember they tried that in the 70s.
[03:04:10.404 --> 03:04:10.924]  Hey, wait a minute.
[03:04:10.984 --> 03:04:11.144]  What?
[03:04:11.385 --> 03:04:13.766]  Guys, go get... I guess there is no Coca-Cola in this office.
[03:04:13.966 --> 03:04:18.509]  Can somebody run to the store and buy a Coca-Cola so we can see what percentage of it?
[03:04:18.869 --> 03:04:26.354]  I would imagine that a Coca-Cola is not, per volume, 42.6%... Fructose corn syrup?
[03:04:26.554 --> 03:04:28.855]  Yeah, I bet this is a lot higher than a Coca-Cola.
[03:04:29.015 --> 03:04:31.457]  Well, the Coca-Cola bottle is probably not going to say the percentage.
[03:04:32.045 --> 03:04:36.188]  Yeah, but you can see per volume and then the grams.
[03:04:36.909 --> 03:04:40.091]  No, this is extremely high in sugar.
[03:04:40.111 --> 03:04:41.272]  But it's got a teddy bear on it.
[03:04:41.552 --> 03:04:42.053]  Exactly.
[03:04:42.673 --> 03:04:43.174]  Exactly.
[03:04:43.274 --> 03:04:45.135]  So that means it's safe for kids.
[03:04:45.155 --> 03:04:46.556]  Look at that teddy bear, it looks happy!
[03:04:46.936 --> 03:04:47.277]  Crazy.
[03:04:47.657 --> 03:04:55.083]  And actually in the big studies, when they fed GMO corn to the gerbils, they did grow hair from inside their mouth.
[03:04:55.123 --> 03:04:55.823]  Maybe that's a good thing.
[03:04:56.584 --> 03:04:59.086]  In fact, it'll be a conspiracy theory if you don't have hair growing in your mouth.
[03:05:00.177 --> 03:05:02.398]  The food storage industry leader has done it again.
[03:05:02.678 --> 03:05:06.779]  Introducing FDG Clubs and Survival Bucks from the Freeze Dry Guy.
[03:05:06.939 --> 03:05:14.642]  For over 39 years, the Freeze Dry Guy has served various government agencies and the private sector with the finest in storable foods and emergency rations.

[03:05:49.515 --> 03:05:50.757]  The Freeze Dry Guy.
[03:05:50.777 --> 03:05:51.778]  The best you can buy.
[03:05:59.264 --> 03:06:04.128]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:06:04.228 --> 03:06:04.988]  What have we got?
[03:06:05.208 --> 03:06:07.350]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:06:07.670 --> 03:06:08.351]  A republic.
[03:06:08.671 --> 03:06:11.253]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[03:06:11.333 --> 03:06:13.234]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[03:06:13.595 --> 03:06:15.496]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:06:15.616 --> 03:06:16.897]  So they think they own our land?
[03:06:17.297 --> 03:06:18.418]  They think they own our water?
[03:06:18.618 --> 03:06:19.019]  Children?
[03:06:19.219 --> 03:06:20.019]  Our education?
[03:06:20.360 --> 03:06:21.000]  Our money?
[03:06:21.180 --> 03:06:24.823]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:06:25.183 --> 03:06:28.847]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[03:06:28.887 --> 03:06:29.848]  You're being warned!
[03:06:30.149 --> 03:06:30.990]  We have the facts.
[03:06:31.190 --> 03:06:32.291]  We have the Constitution.
[03:06:32.351 --> 03:06:33.232]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[03:06:33.252 --> 03:06:34.073]  We have common law.
[03:06:34.133 --> 03:06:36.395]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:06:36.656 --> 03:06:40.440]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[03:06:40.540 --> 03:06:45.325]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[03:06:45.505 --> 03:06:46.867]  A new tool in the Info War.
[03:06:47.007 --> 03:06:47.828]  Don't tread on me.
[03:06:48.088 --> 03:06:54.575]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[03:06:59.409 --> 03:06:59.890]  Attention!
[03:07:00.070 --> 03:07:15.150]  An important product from hempusa.org, micro plant powder, will change your life by removing all types of positive toxins such as heavy metals, parasites, bacteria, viruses, and fungus from the digestive tract and stomach wall so you can absorb nutrients.
[03:07:15.430 --> 03:07:23.873]  Micro plant powder is 89% silica and packed with a negative charge that attracts positive toxins from the blood, organs, spine and brain.
[03:07:24.073 --> 03:07:29.755]  This product has the ability to rebuild cartilage and bone which allows synovial fluid to return to the joints.
[03:07:30.015 --> 03:07:35.737]  Silica is a precursor to calcium, meaning the body turns silica into calcium and is great for the heart.
[03:07:35.877 --> 03:07:41.379]  There is no better time than now to have micro plant powder on your shelf or in your storage shelter.
[03:07:41.519 --> 03:07:42.519]  And with an unlimited
[03:07:42.659 --> 03:07:42.919]  I think so.
[03:08:08.131 --> 03:08:09.371]  We are on the march.
[03:08:09.712 --> 03:08:12.092]  The Empire is on the run.
[03:08:12.873 --> 03:08:16.574]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:20.035 --> 03:08:27.218]  Okay, Mike, you know, I was having some gallows humor there, joking about that baby formula powder.
[03:08:27.678 --> 03:08:35.481]  But look at all the scandals in Africa, in Asia, where you'll have tens of thousands of kids die because the government didn't mix the formula right.
[03:08:36.401 --> 03:08:43.583]  And, you know, you look at children now, they admit the U.S., and you can pull up mainstream articles, the IQ's down 10 to 20 points, depending on what study.
[03:08:44.323 --> 03:08:46.964]  I mean, literally, they won't hire cops under 100 IQ.
[03:08:46.984 --> 03:08:48.284]  They want dumb people.
[03:08:48.844 --> 03:08:55.706]  And I think back to being in, because I have three children, and just reading the labels on things like Pedialyte, where it's,
[03:08:56.386 --> 03:08:58.407]  Aspartame.
[03:08:58.627 --> 03:09:00.989]  Go back over this without me making sick jokes about it.
[03:09:01.389 --> 03:09:04.451]  I mean really talk about what's in this stuff and then the other issues you wanted to cover.
[03:09:04.471 --> 03:09:07.232]  Then we're going to Annie, Ruth, Tim, Diane, Jeff and others.
[03:09:07.452 --> 03:09:08.713]  Well no, you made a good point.
[03:09:08.733 --> 03:09:13.156]  I mean if you want to see some crazy stuff out in the stores, look at children's medication.
[03:09:13.476 --> 03:09:15.017]  Over-the-counter medication for kids.
[03:09:15.817 --> 03:09:17.158]  It's loaded with aspartame.
[03:09:17.558 --> 03:09:19.079]  It's loaded with artificial colors.
[03:09:19.439 --> 03:09:21.600]  The cough syrups are a complete joke.
[03:09:21.860 --> 03:09:26.362]  I mean, even some of the health regulators say they don't even work and they could actually harm your children.
[03:09:27.803 --> 03:09:33.606]  It's what they feed kids and what they manufacture for you to feed your kids in this country should be a crime.
[03:09:33.646 --> 03:09:41.390]  Well, I mean, it's like when you go onto the store shelves and it's fluoride for your kids, back to school, baby fluoride, increased fluoride.
[03:09:41.590 --> 03:09:45.452]  When that reduces IQ, bone cancer, I mean, they're clearly targeting them.
[03:09:45.592 --> 03:09:46.632]  Well, absolutely they are.
[03:09:47.252 --> 03:09:51.033]  Go back over this loving document, Cam.
[03:09:51.053 --> 03:09:52.153]  He's said most of the stories.
[03:09:52.173 --> 03:09:53.174]  Here, I'll hold it up again.
[03:09:53.634 --> 03:09:59.735]  This is over 50% sugars, according to what's on the label that I'm reading right here.
[03:10:00.415 --> 03:10:02.636]  So, 42.6% corn syrup solids, 14.7% soy protein isolate,
[03:10:08.417 --> 03:10:19.031]  And another 10.5% sugar, and then it's got some safflower oil, some soy... Excuse me, it's 42.6% corn syrup, high fructose, and then there's more sugar?
[03:10:19.151 --> 03:10:19.572]  Exactly.
[03:10:19.792 --> 03:10:20.093]  Another 10%.
[03:10:20.153 --> 03:10:20.473]  So that's 52.6%.
[03:10:20.513 --> 03:10:21.374]  This is over 50% sugar.
[03:10:25.953 --> 03:10:41.923]  Now, if you wanted... I mean, who would... What mom would go into the kitchen and say, I want to mix up a recipe for my babies and throw in 50% sugar and mix it up and put that in a bottle and let their babies... Here's some GMO soybeans, honey.
[03:10:43.003 --> 03:10:44.924]  Here's some Roundup Ready Soybean.
[03:10:45.225 --> 03:10:47.706]  Here's some... Here's 52.6% sugar pumpkin cake.
[03:10:51.248 --> 03:10:59.153]  And think about this, you've got Child Protective Services in this country going after parents who will choose a living foods diet for their children.
[03:10:59.273 --> 03:11:01.034]  Or if they get too much, quote, sun.
[03:11:01.354 --> 03:11:02.614]  Oh, exactly, exactly.
[03:11:02.714 --> 03:11:05.596]  Or if you don't vaccinate your children, you're considered a bad parent.
[03:11:05.896 --> 03:11:09.638]  But you can feed your babies this stuff, 50% sugar, and you're a good parent.
[03:11:10.239 --> 03:11:11.599]  But I mean, let's zoom in on that, though.
[03:11:11.619 --> 03:11:12.560]  Folks, show the teddy bear.
[03:11:14.181 --> 03:11:16.022]  Why do you want to hurt the teddy bear?
[03:11:16.769 --> 03:11:18.611]  Well, this is, you know, teddy bear marketing.
[03:11:18.971 --> 03:11:20.072]  It's all about symbolism.
[03:11:20.412 --> 03:11:22.053]  It's all about image and not substance.
[03:11:22.654 --> 03:11:29.159]  Because I would not want to put this, you know, Semilac, go and grow, soy-based formula.
[03:11:30.640 --> 03:11:32.342]  Well, I think it's wonderful stuff.
[03:11:34.309 --> 03:11:35.230]  No, I mean really.
[03:11:36.171 --> 03:11:36.952]  Hold on a minute.
[03:11:37.513 --> 03:11:38.394]  Hold on a minute.
[03:11:38.414 --> 03:11:41.258]  Aw, look at him.
[03:11:41.898 --> 03:11:43.300]  Got the little bear there.
[03:11:43.320 --> 03:11:45.443]  He wants to be a little teddy.
[03:11:45.823 --> 03:11:46.544]  There he is.
[03:11:47.005 --> 03:11:47.946]  Look, he can walk!
[03:11:48.647 --> 03:11:51.090]  He's 14 years old and just learned how to walk.
[03:11:51.150 --> 03:11:52.692]  He's one of the most advanced humans.
[03:11:53.826 --> 03:11:54.086]  Mm-hmm.
[03:11:55.026 --> 03:11:56.987]  He's been on... I'm sorry.
[03:11:57.047 --> 03:11:59.068]  You're right to make fun of it.
[03:11:59.468 --> 03:12:02.609]  And if you think about children today, they have a nature deficiency.
[03:12:03.109 --> 03:12:11.893]  Because most kids in America are vitamin D deficient, there was research that recently came out showing that microbes in the soil actually make you more intelligent.
[03:12:12.373 --> 03:12:18.335]  So if you go out and you play in the dirt, you're smarter than the kid that lives in a sterile environment drinking 50% sugar.
[03:12:18.435 --> 03:12:20.516]  I mean, they learned that with the bubble boy.
[03:12:21.436 --> 03:12:23.698]  I mean, literally, I'm real clean.
[03:12:23.738 --> 03:12:24.919]  I take two showers a day.
[03:12:25.380 --> 03:12:29.143]  But, at the same time, I mean, I'll eat a piece of pizza off the floor.
[03:12:29.663 --> 03:12:30.404]  I mean, seriously.
[03:12:30.484 --> 03:12:31.064]  I mean, you know what?
[03:12:31.625 --> 03:12:39.972]  I mean, I'll... Sometimes if I've been hunting and I've gotten a deer, I'll just slice off of... I'll pull the heart out, slice up and repeat.
[03:12:40.012 --> 03:12:41.433]  You ever eaten a raw deer heart?
[03:12:41.813 --> 03:12:43.494]  No, that's not... I haven't done that, Alex.
[03:12:45.396 --> 03:12:47.278]  But I'm just saying, I mean, I'm somebody who...
[03:12:48.924 --> 03:12:56.547]  I almost never get sick, unless it's allergies, and all the major studies are showing that's connected to the GMO I've eaten over my life, that that triggers them.
[03:12:56.987 --> 03:12:57.728]  Well, that's exactly it.
[03:12:57.808 --> 03:13:04.150]  You and I both have a history of some toxic foods before we sort of woke up, you know, to what's really out there.
[03:13:04.170 --> 03:13:06.851]  Before I woke up and ate those Cocoa Puffs for lunch.
[03:13:07.652 --> 03:13:08.052]  Oh, man.
[03:13:08.332 --> 03:13:08.792]  I'm joking.
[03:13:08.852 --> 03:13:09.332]  I know you are.
[03:13:10.093 --> 03:13:12.114]  I didn't see a box of Cocoa Puffs here in the studio.
[03:13:12.134 --> 03:13:13.014]  That's because they ate them.
[03:13:15.560 --> 03:13:17.982]  Let's bring that on next time and talk about the sugar and cocoa.
[03:13:18.022 --> 03:13:20.765]  I'll tell you, Jaron's the greatest example of health in this office.
[03:13:20.845 --> 03:13:21.625]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:13:22.967 --> 03:13:29.733]  No, but a lot of us, even people who choose a healthy lifestyle today, they have some toxicity from the past.
[03:13:30.273 --> 03:13:31.674]  And whose fault is this?
[03:13:32.195 --> 03:13:39.662]  It's, again, it's this conspiracy between the government regulators and the food industries and the pharmaceutical industries that don't want you to know.
[03:13:40.242 --> 03:13:45.044]  They go to great lengths to keep you uninformed and misinformed.
[03:13:45.064 --> 03:13:47.725]  Well, that's like, I tell people this five years ago, they didn't believe me.
[03:13:47.765 --> 03:13:50.227]  Now it's even CNN, but they report it like it's good.
[03:13:50.727 --> 03:13:56.990]  Oh, there's a type of silicone in your McNuggets and in most of your processed foods.
[03:13:57.030 --> 03:13:58.350]  What's wrong with a petrochemical?
[03:13:58.370 --> 03:13:59.511]  You're supposed to drink crude oil.
[03:14:00.472 --> 03:14:01.413]  Well, here's another example.
[03:14:01.794 --> 03:14:03.356]  Go out and buy blueberry bagels.
[03:14:04.017 --> 03:14:04.919]  Or blueberry bread.
[03:14:05.099 --> 03:14:08.123]  You'll find that most of those blueberries are not made out of blueberries.
[03:14:08.524 --> 03:14:09.806]  They're made out of three ingredients.
[03:14:10.467 --> 03:14:14.693]  Partially hydrogenated oils, liquid sugars, and artificial food colors.
[03:14:14.713 --> 03:14:15.475]  That's good for your heart.
[03:14:15.835 --> 03:14:16.256]  Exactly.
[03:14:17.016 --> 03:14:18.717]  Look at that teddy bear, he looks good.
[03:14:18.777 --> 03:14:21.279]  They should put some blueberries in the formula right here.
[03:14:21.299 --> 03:14:22.159]  Along with the beetles.
[03:14:22.259 --> 03:14:23.720]  Blueberry sugar formula.
[03:14:23.740 --> 03:14:24.701]  Blueberry beetles!
[03:14:24.741 --> 03:14:26.522]  That could be a new brand for them.
[03:14:27.202 --> 03:14:27.642]  Exactly.
[03:14:28.183 --> 03:14:30.064]  And some of them have propylene glycol in it.
[03:14:30.184 --> 03:14:32.825]  And that's the stuff that you use to winterize RVs.
[03:14:32.965 --> 03:14:33.706]  What's wrong with that?
[03:14:33.726 --> 03:14:35.687]  Well, it's great for RVs.
[03:14:35.707 --> 03:14:38.589]  I mean, what about when a cat drinks antifreeze?
[03:14:38.629 --> 03:14:38.989]  It's good.
[03:14:39.489 --> 03:14:41.991]  Yeah, wouldn't want my kids drinking it.
[03:14:42.947 --> 03:14:45.812]  But this is the kind of stuff that people need to know.
[03:14:46.514 --> 03:14:49.820]  And the FDA is going out of its way to make sure that they don't know it.
[03:14:51.323 --> 03:14:55.310]  Well, you just don't care about children, Mike, being able to have that nice teddy bear.
[03:14:56.095 --> 03:14:56.375]  I know.
[03:14:56.455 --> 03:14:58.257]  I mean, if it were up to me, Alex, I would go in.
[03:14:58.297 --> 03:15:02.340]  I would ban sugar infant formula for babies.
[03:15:02.740 --> 03:15:03.020]  I would.
[03:15:03.080 --> 03:15:04.922]  I would force this off the shelves.
[03:15:04.982 --> 03:15:14.108]  I mean, you know, if they gave me the... Of course, if the eugenicists, to break up the family, hadn't told women how cool it was to not breastfeed their babies, women have got the equipment.
[03:15:14.469 --> 03:15:14.889]  And guess what?
[03:15:14.929 --> 03:15:22.235]  It's designed just for the baby, and it gives them all that colostrum, the vaccines of every woman before that woman in history, delivered to that child.
[03:15:22.975 --> 03:15:27.182]  Heaven forbid we drink cow milk that hasn't been boiled or pasteurized.
[03:15:27.262 --> 03:15:28.344]  It passes on some things.
[03:15:29.065 --> 03:15:29.506]  Exactly.
[03:15:30.087 --> 03:15:32.631]  Oh, and we haven't talked about this vaccine season.
[03:15:32.731 --> 03:15:36.797]  They're already pushing hard for everybody to go out and get vaccinated now.
[03:15:37.711 --> 03:15:39.172]  They want you to get vaccinated early.
[03:15:39.192 --> 03:15:40.654]  I bet the teddy bear will be vaccinated.
[03:15:40.714 --> 03:15:42.696]  He will.
[03:15:43.136 --> 03:15:46.939]  He will be vaccinated along with all the kids drinking this formula.
[03:15:47.320 --> 03:15:49.982]  Have you seen the kids shows on PBS?
[03:15:50.402 --> 03:15:53.425]  What's that clip we played last year where the teacher goes MWAHAHAHA!
[03:15:54.726 --> 03:16:01.450]  If you search the term TV pushes vaccines on kids, cartoon pushes vaccines on kids, and it's literally like demonic.
[03:16:01.830 --> 03:16:04.112]  It's like, you take the shot, you'll feel much better!
[03:16:04.132 --> 03:16:06.193]  Sorry.
[03:16:06.393 --> 03:16:08.875]  I've seen some cartoons pushing vaccines.
[03:16:09.355 --> 03:16:10.035]  It's pretty crazy.
[03:16:10.676 --> 03:16:17.139]  It's kind of like, remember they used to complain about the tobacco companies using Joe Camel to sell cigarettes?
[03:16:17.520 --> 03:16:19.181]  Well, they're using the same thing to sell vaccines.
[03:16:19.781 --> 03:16:20.182]  For kids.
[03:16:20.422 --> 03:16:24.209]  But it was a conspiracy 40 years ago to say cigarettes gave you cancer.
[03:16:25.310 --> 03:16:26.713]  Cigarettes are good for you.
[03:16:27.214 --> 03:16:29.758]  And so is a diet for a baby of 52% corn syrup.
[03:16:29.778 --> 03:16:29.938]  Come on.
[03:16:32.315 --> 03:16:39.739]  Well, I know, Alex, I didn't mean to be so unreasonable here today to suggest that babies shouldn't drink corn sugar and... Well, no, they got me using the term!
[03:16:40.079 --> 03:16:40.619]  Corn sugar!
[03:16:40.939 --> 03:16:42.460]  It's corn syrup solids, folks.
[03:16:43.040 --> 03:16:43.901]  Corn syrup solids.
[03:16:44.521 --> 03:16:45.242]  And fructose.
[03:16:45.542 --> 03:16:46.262]  And sucrose.
[03:16:46.302 --> 03:16:48.023]  This is not stuff that babies should be drinking.
[03:16:48.303 --> 03:16:49.744]  They should be drinking mother's milk.
[03:16:50.364 --> 03:16:51.465]  And they should get sunshine.
[03:16:51.525 --> 03:16:57.228]  That's a conspi... Literally, in the 20 years from now, if we don't stop this, it'll be a conspiracy theory that women ever breastfed.
[03:16:57.608 --> 03:17:01.830]  It probably... It'll be a conspiracy theory that people could talk.
[03:17:03.459 --> 03:17:11.023]  Well, you know, doctors today are telling women that if there's cancer in their family, they have to have a double mastectomy to prevent cancer.
[03:17:11.783 --> 03:17:15.445]  They are cutting off their breasts to prevent cancer in women who don't even have it.
[03:17:16.721 --> 03:17:16.921]  This is
[03:17:39.918 --> 03:17:49.722]  Sodium fluoride, 100% attacks all the organs, the bones, massively increases cancer, and is directly linked to breast cancer, but so is melamine.
[03:17:50.122 --> 03:17:53.083]  So is bisphenol A. All of this.
[03:17:53.143 --> 03:17:56.904]  So women wonder why they're having so many problems.
[03:17:57.004 --> 03:17:58.645]  I mean, because they're killing you!
[03:17:59.755 --> 03:18:04.397]  Yeah, a lot of women really don't know where it's coming from, and they're not getting information from good sources.
[03:18:04.717 --> 03:18:13.159]  That's why I really appreciate what you're doing here, Alex, and thanks for having me on today, too, because women especially need to know you can prevent breast cancer.
[03:18:13.460 --> 03:18:17.401]  Vitamin D alone, according to the research that I've seen, that I've quoted, it's...
[03:18:17.961 --> 03:18:18.942]  You know, science journals.
[03:18:18.982 --> 03:18:23.585]  But Cass Sunstein says that it's a conspiracy theory to say the sun is good for you.
[03:18:23.906 --> 03:18:25.827]  And he says you should be basically arrested.
[03:18:25.867 --> 03:18:26.688]  We're not making this up.
[03:18:27.088 --> 03:18:28.449]  And you go, why is he talking about the sun?
[03:18:28.749 --> 03:18:31.531]  You don't get the real vitamin D, do you, without getting that sun?
[03:18:31.611 --> 03:18:33.893]  They want you to live in caves like Osama bin Laden.
[03:18:33.993 --> 03:18:34.774]  That's basically...
[03:18:35.114 --> 03:18:42.200]  I'm sorry, go over your research on the... Basically, four out of five cancers can be prevented just from vitamin D alone.
[03:18:42.720 --> 03:18:50.707]  And if you take some magnesium, you'll have better absorption of vitamin D. Vitamin D, there are receptors for this vitamin on every major organ.
[03:18:50.727 --> 03:18:52.809]  You mean we are designed to get sun?
[03:18:53.009 --> 03:18:53.569]  Unbelievable.
[03:18:53.850 --> 03:18:54.170]  I know.
[03:18:54.350 --> 03:19:00.255]  I wonder why white people have white skin, because we came from an area more north, we need to absorb more of it.
[03:19:00.595 --> 03:19:00.896]  That's it.
[03:19:01.736 --> 03:19:03.416]  People would just look around.
[03:19:04.197 --> 03:19:06.617]  And, you know, you shouldn't be afraid of the sun.
[03:19:07.037 --> 03:19:07.978]  It's there for a purpose.
[03:19:07.998 --> 03:19:23.341]  Yeah, and yes, folks, you will get old, and sometimes you'll get skin cancer, but the studies show you'll get more internal cancers, the ones that really kill you, if you don't get the sun, but also a lot of skin cancers, I've read the major studies, are because if you don't have the right nutrients in you, then you get sun.
[03:19:23.761 --> 03:19:24.341]  Bye-bye.
[03:19:24.821 --> 03:19:31.183]  If you have good nutrition, your chances of skin cancer drop to near zero, especially if you're doing superfoods.
[03:19:31.223 --> 03:19:31.964]  Well, I'm sold.
[03:19:32.484 --> 03:19:33.845]  You know, I'm an extremist.
[03:19:33.925 --> 03:19:35.766]  And either I'm extremely unhealthy or extremely healthy.
[03:19:36.347 --> 03:19:38.929]  I am going to take the path of the health ranger.
[03:19:39.769 --> 03:19:40.810]  I'm happy to hear that, Alex.
[03:19:41.130 --> 03:19:42.391]  And you sure you don't want the Similac?
[03:19:42.411 --> 03:19:43.312]  Because I could leave it here.
[03:19:43.472 --> 03:19:44.873]  It's like they say in Caddyshack.
[03:19:44.933 --> 03:19:51.017]  It's like I've been with the Dalai Lama and he's told me I will be given total consciousness at my death.
[03:19:51.218 --> 03:19:52.058]  Oonga galoonga.
[03:19:52.659 --> 03:19:53.719]  By the way, I talked to Jesse Ventura.
[03:19:53.739 --> 03:19:56.281]  He really asked the Dalai Lama, have you seen Caddyshack?
[03:19:56.481 --> 03:19:57.862]  We'll be right back with your phone call.
[03:19:57.882 --> 03:19:58.303]  Stay with us.

[03:20:36.573 --> 03:20:39.055]  The crisis in the Gulf and possible evacuations.

[03:20:59.432 --> 03:21:05.658]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[03:21:06.118 --> 03:21:13.885]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[03:21:14.225 --> 03:21:22.072]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[03:21:22.392 --> 03:21:27.153]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[03:21:27.473 --> 03:21:32.194]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[03:21:32.694 --> 03:21:36.555]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[03:21:37.035 --> 03:21:38.055]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:21:38.135 --> 03:21:42.216]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[03:21:42.636 --> 03:21:47.017]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[03:21:47.537 --> 03:21:50.038]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[03:21:50.518 --> 03:21:52.181]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[03:21:52.302 --> 03:21:52.542]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:02.913 --> 03:22:03.833]  Tyranny is here.
[03:22:04.173 --> 03:22:07.775]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:22:07.795 --> 03:22:10.315]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:22:10.335 --> 03:22:15.777]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:22:16.197 --> 03:22:22.439]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:22:22.859 --> 03:22:28.421]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:22:28.842 --> 03:22:32.523]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[03:22:33.023 --> 03:22:37.005]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:22:37.305 --> 03:22:42.867]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[03:22:43.247 --> 03:22:46.329]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:22:46.809 --> 03:22:48.229]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:22:48.790 --> 03:22:49.230]  It's here.
[03:22:49.891 --> 03:22:56.728]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[03:22:57.819 --> 03:22:58.499]  Less is more.
[03:22:58.740 --> 03:23:03.582]  I want you to think of Life Change T as, well, a 2008 Ferrari 612.
[03:23:04.102 --> 03:23:12.147]  The Ferrari 612 is a 2-door, 4-passenger luxury car that gives an exploding 540 horsepower through its 6-liter V12.
[03:23:12.347 --> 03:23:18.290]  It has a top speed of 199 miles per hour and can accelerate 0 to 60 in about 4 seconds.
[03:23:18.510 --> 03:23:21.592]  Life Change T will accelerate your life into feeling more energy.
[03:23:21.792 --> 03:23:25.795]  Losing weight and cleansing toxins out of your body so you'll live longer.
[03:23:25.995 --> 03:23:26.635]  And guess what?
[03:23:26.795 --> 03:23:31.118]  You can accelerate your life without a Ferrari 612 sticker price of $318,000.
[03:23:31.158 --> 03:23:38.003]  You can buy green tea for less, but unfortunately, it's just another daily driver with no performance.
[03:23:38.223 --> 03:23:41.486]  So for just about a dollar a day, you can drive the Ferrari of T's.
[03:23:41.626 --> 03:23:43.147]  Don't be fooled by size.
[03:23:43.327 --> 03:23:46.089]  Check our website out at GetTheTee.com.
[03:23:46.170 --> 03:23:48.271]  That's GetTheTee.com.

[03:23:49.312 --> 03:23:50.073]  Again, that's 928-308-0408.
[03:23:50.093 --> 03:23:51.334]  Remember Life Change Tee.
[03:23:59.918 --> 03:24:01.879]  Okay, folks, we are back live.
[03:24:02.039 --> 03:24:10.884]  This was run during the flu season last year on PBS Kids, where they're dancing around, the little boy's scared, but they're gonna give him a shot.
[03:24:10.944 --> 03:24:11.284]  Here it is.
[03:24:16.286 --> 03:24:16.786]  It's fun!
[03:24:16.826 --> 03:24:19.108]  If I don't get the virus, I won't give it to you!
[03:24:19.208 --> 03:24:21.929]  If you don't give it to me, I won't give it to her!
[03:24:22.030 --> 03:24:24.751]  If I don't get it from her, I won't give it to them!
[03:24:24.891 --> 03:24:25.812]  That's true!
[03:24:26.572 --> 03:24:28.734]  If I don't get the virus, I won't give it to you!
[03:24:29.494 --> 03:24:31.795]  Hey kids, we're ready to roll!
[03:24:31.815 --> 03:24:32.516]  Stop the night!
[03:24:36.274 --> 03:24:37.515]  We're getting the shot.
[03:24:37.655 --> 03:24:39.535]  It might hurt a little bit.
[03:24:39.575 --> 03:24:40.936]  Just a little bit.
[03:24:40.956 --> 03:24:42.437]  But it's gonna help a whole lot.
[03:24:43.517 --> 03:24:45.118]  Hey kids, I'm ready to roll.
[03:24:45.798 --> 03:24:48.439]  Stopping that virus, that's my goal.
[03:24:48.599 --> 03:24:51.420]  So come on everybody, we're getting the shot.
[03:24:51.440 --> 03:24:53.001]  It might hurt a little bit.
[03:24:53.081 --> 03:24:57.443]  Just a little bit.
[03:24:57.523 --> 03:24:57.743]  Ouch!
[03:24:58.083 --> 03:24:59.484]  But it's gonna help a whole lot.
[03:25:02.932 --> 03:25:17.021]  Hey where's the you didn't play it from the start where she goes find them and notice it's all so the little kid he gets to be cool with the older kids because he gets the shot it turns out it reduces immunity makes him doubly
[03:25:18.908 --> 03:25:21.491]  Susceptible to the regular seasonal flu.
[03:25:21.831 --> 03:25:22.992]  Mainstream News admits that.
[03:25:23.433 --> 03:25:29.439]  And it was all a fraud and it increases his seizure rate by 10 times and gives him all sorts of brain damage.
[03:25:29.619 --> 03:25:30.460]  All admitted, all.
[03:25:30.660 --> 03:25:31.801]  We were right about that again.
[03:25:32.262 --> 03:25:33.183]  But it's so much fun.
[03:25:33.203 --> 03:25:35.705]  Did we find the part where she laughs like a goblin?
[03:25:37.287 --> 03:25:39.149]  Okay, well while we're looking for that to find that...
[03:25:40.697 --> 03:25:42.278]  It might hurt a little, but it's gonna help a whole lot!
[03:26:01.340 --> 03:26:01.860]  You know, they should.
[03:26:01.940 --> 03:26:05.821]  That cartoon should say, um, these kids are the medical experiment for today.
[03:26:05.841 --> 03:26:07.382]  Because that's what they're doing.
[03:26:07.422 --> 03:26:08.842]  That's a medical experiment.
[03:26:09.342 --> 03:26:10.522]  But hey, but she's happy.
[03:26:10.562 --> 03:26:12.423]  I mean, she sounds like Dr. Frankenstein.
[03:26:12.443 --> 03:26:12.863]  Here it is.
[03:26:13.143 --> 03:26:14.683]  Kids, we're ready to roll.
[03:26:14.983 --> 03:26:17.444]  Stopping that virus, that's our goal.
[03:26:17.484 --> 03:26:18.884]  So come on, everybody.
[03:26:19.104 --> 03:26:20.105]  We're getting the shot.
[03:26:20.205 --> 03:26:21.645]  It might hurt a little bit.
[03:26:21.685 --> 03:26:22.725]  Just a little bit.
[03:26:22.765 --> 03:26:24.606]  But it's gonna help a whole lot.
[03:26:26.763 --> 03:26:28.384]  That's a little enjoyment.
[03:26:28.404 --> 03:26:29.704]  That's a little inside joke.
[03:26:30.184 --> 03:26:31.345]  It's gonna help a whole lot.
[03:26:31.365 --> 03:26:34.586]  Oh yes!
[03:26:35.386 --> 03:26:36.687]  It is an inside joke.
[03:26:36.787 --> 03:26:44.229]  If they really wanted to help those kids, Alex, they'd be handing out vitamin D supplements or fish oil supplements or just letting them go outside and play.
[03:26:44.289 --> 03:26:46.350]  They'd have them in the creek catching tadpoles.
[03:26:48.689 --> 03:26:54.330]  They do something other than... You know, they don't allow nationwide dodgeball or chase or any type of exertion, no.
[03:26:54.950 --> 03:27:01.771]  There was a study recently, Alex, that said 95% of Americans never do anything that requires exertion.
[03:27:02.531 --> 03:27:02.711]  Only 5%.
[03:27:04.192 --> 03:27:09.733]  So the most exercise some people get is walking across the parking lot to go buy their pharmaceuticals.
[03:27:10.353 --> 03:27:13.253]  Or maybe they just go to the drive-thru to get them now.
[03:27:13.533 --> 03:27:14.814]  You've got drive-thru pharmacies.
[03:27:14.854 --> 03:27:16.474]  I think I'm gonna swim 2,000 yards today.
[03:27:18.749 --> 03:27:19.189]  I'll join you.
[03:27:19.810 --> 03:27:20.270]  Really, you want to go?
[03:27:20.290 --> 03:27:20.931]  Yeah, let's go.
[03:27:21.912 --> 03:27:23.053]  We go to the lakes from across it.
[03:27:23.493 --> 03:27:23.814]  I'm good.
[03:27:24.014 --> 03:27:24.915]  I'm going to do that Saturday.
[03:27:25.495 --> 03:27:25.835]  Okay.
[03:27:26.576 --> 03:27:27.557]  How long are you here in town?
[03:27:27.777 --> 03:27:30.179]  Well, I don't want to say that on the air, Alex, but I'll go with you.
[03:27:30.840 --> 03:27:32.301]  That's right, you got the spooks after you.
[03:27:33.242 --> 03:27:38.227]  Well, you know, us truth tellers have to be careful about who knows where we are.
[03:27:38.547 --> 03:27:38.747]  Yeah.
[03:27:38.907 --> 03:27:41.870]  I mean, I had people... The bad guys got to be careful if they find me.
[03:27:43.283 --> 03:27:44.184]  I'm sure that's the case.
[03:27:44.884 --> 03:27:45.144]  Yes.
[03:27:45.885 --> 03:27:48.507]  But it's true.
[03:27:50.588 --> 03:28:01.435]  They don't want us to be able to educate people about these things because when people wake up and start thinking, and there are a lot of great, well-informed people out there who are on top of the situation,
[03:28:02.316 --> 03:28:02.476]  Yeah.
[03:28:18.387 --> 03:28:19.708]  Well, you're also very credible.
[03:28:20.048 --> 03:28:20.708]  You're very credible.
[03:28:21.128 --> 03:28:22.049]  I want to quit hogging you.
[03:28:22.089 --> 03:28:23.169]  Let's go to some phone calls.
[03:28:23.189 --> 03:28:26.331]  And we're going to have him most of the next segment, folks, as well.
[03:28:26.771 --> 03:28:28.132]  It's so good to meet you in person.
[03:28:28.472 --> 03:28:30.373]  It's really great to be here and to see you, Alex.
[03:28:30.433 --> 03:28:32.154]  I've been interviewing you for, what, six, seven years?
[03:28:32.614 --> 03:28:34.114]  It's been a number of years.
[03:28:34.215 --> 03:28:35.515]  We've always done it over the phone.
[03:28:35.875 --> 03:28:36.716]  And that's fine.
[03:28:36.776 --> 03:28:38.597]  But here in person, we can actually have more fun.
[03:28:38.937 --> 03:28:39.237]  You know what?
[03:28:39.297 --> 03:28:40.958]  I'll bring more baby food next time.
[03:28:42.418 --> 03:28:44.199]  Actually, I'm kind of hungry right now.
[03:28:44.300 --> 03:28:45.200]  Is there a beetle in that?
[03:28:45.800 --> 03:28:48.002]  Let's go ahead and talk to Annie in Indiana.
[03:28:48.122 --> 03:28:48.962]  Annie, you're on the air.
[03:28:50.223 --> 03:28:50.923]  Good afternoon.
[03:28:50.963 --> 03:28:52.324]  It's a great show today, guys.
[03:28:52.784 --> 03:28:53.084]  Thank you.
[03:28:53.104 --> 03:28:53.425]  Thank you.
[03:28:53.905 --> 03:28:55.606]  And I have a question for you, Mike.
[03:28:55.846 --> 03:28:59.328]  I believe I've already seen you on YouTube as the Health Ranger.
[03:28:59.988 --> 03:29:01.309]  Yeah, probably so.
[03:29:01.329 --> 03:29:06.092]  Yeah, he's not wearing his little black, you know, disguise like the Lone Ranger today.
[03:29:06.132 --> 03:29:09.214]  And Tonto's not here with him, but yeah, no, he's out of disguise.
[03:29:11.625 --> 03:29:12.146]  Oh, gosh.
[03:29:12.646 --> 03:29:13.567]  And I have a question.
[03:29:13.607 --> 03:29:15.528]  I have a big red dog, 90 pounds.
[03:29:15.568 --> 03:29:17.329]  She looks like a red lab.
[03:29:17.409 --> 03:29:18.570]  I call her Red Dog.
[03:29:18.590 --> 03:29:21.212]  Except for the big clip at the big red dog.
[03:29:22.232 --> 03:29:26.775]  Like most red-haired humans, she has skin allergies and she's allergic to flea bite.
[03:29:26.815 --> 03:29:29.117]  She's constantly biting and chewing on herself.
[03:29:30.021 --> 03:29:35.403]  And I'm starting to realize it's possibly the GMO dried dog food I've been feeding her.
[03:29:35.704 --> 03:29:37.144]  Well, stay there.
[03:29:37.184 --> 03:29:40.166]  I haven't done a lot of research on mainline dog food.
[03:29:41.066 --> 03:29:43.127]  I'll tell you about it on the other side.
[03:29:43.167 --> 03:29:44.567]  We'll get the health ranger.
[03:29:44.587 --> 03:29:46.028]  We'll get his take on it.
[03:29:49.830 --> 03:29:50.730]  We're on the march.
[03:29:51.230 --> 03:29:52.831]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.851 --> 03:29:56.453]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.351 --> 03:30:04.714]  If you owe money to the IRS, you can't make the problem go away by yourself.
[03:30:04.934 --> 03:30:08.537]  But with the help of Dan Pilla, you can get your problem solved once and for all.
[03:30:08.857 --> 03:30:09.818]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.

[03:30:15.363 --> 03:30:18.946]  We take a very simple but proven three-step approach to solving your problem.

[03:30:46.019 --> 03:30:50.681]  Dan Pilla has been protecting taxpayers from the IRS for three decades and he can help you too.
[03:30:51.181 --> 03:30:51.962]  Call us today at 800-346-6829.
[03:30:51.982 --> 03:30:52.382]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX.
[03:30:59.440 --> 03:31:01.743]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:31:01.823 --> 03:31:04.045]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:31:04.145 --> 03:31:06.969]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:31:07.349 --> 03:31:12.095]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:31:12.455 --> 03:31:16.640]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:31:16.960 --> 03:31:19.323]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:31:19.423 --> 03:31:21.827]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:31:21.847 --> 03:31:24.770]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:31:25.111 --> 03:31:32.701]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:31:33.041 --> 03:31:38.304]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:31:38.324 --> 03:31:40.685]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:31:41.285 --> 03:31:44.727]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:31:44.967 --> 03:31:45.888]  And I got news for you.
[03:31:46.028 --> 03:31:47.329]  You're everyone else.

[03:33:23.633 --> 03:33:32.081]  Advocate, hands down, for true healthy living and exposing this eugenics takeover, Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, here with us.
[03:33:32.141 --> 03:33:38.286]  Now, I'm going to run through five calls quickly, because I do want to hear from you, but I need to get to some breaking news.
[03:33:38.346 --> 03:33:41.689]  Remember, ABC website tells kids when they should die?
[03:33:42.430 --> 03:33:43.311]  That's news.com.au.
[03:33:45.092 --> 03:33:50.821]  And kids are taught in cartoons and on the ABC website that animals are dying if they don't commit suicide.
[03:33:51.281 --> 03:33:53.685]  And you've seen families shoot themselves, shoot their baby.
[03:33:54.165 --> 03:33:56.889]  Now that happened in South America, the guy take over Discovery Channel.
[03:33:57.370 --> 03:33:59.433]  And they're now saying all over the news, they're calling it eco.
[03:34:00.678 --> 03:34:03.459]  Eco-fascism, and this is why I criticize Avatar.
[03:34:03.479 --> 03:34:12.184]  They take a real message that we're in trouble, and their answer is, keep eating GMO, but we need to tax carbon dioxide, you know, that plants breathe.
[03:34:12.404 --> 03:34:18.407]  So they're taking over people's reasonable concerns and co-opting it, kind of like Glenn Beck does to conservatives and libertarians.
[03:34:18.727 --> 03:34:20.388]  That's how they dominate and control things.
[03:34:21.248 --> 03:34:23.649]  But ABC News website tells kids when they should die.
[03:34:24.289 --> 03:34:27.071]  Dillingpole, the London Telegraph, they have a new TV ad
[03:34:27.731 --> 03:34:33.275]  That's four minutes long, where kids are basically taught how great it is to lower their carbon footprint if they would just die.
[03:34:33.335 --> 03:34:34.195]  It's very gruesome.
[03:34:34.536 --> 03:34:38.958]  I want to warn people that are watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, but this is what kids are being shown.
[03:34:39.319 --> 03:34:43.762]  Go green or we'll kill your kids, says Richard Curtis, eco-propaganda shocker.
[03:34:44.342 --> 03:34:50.066]  And so I want to go over the fact that that's one reason a lot of kids are committing suicide now, and they cite I'm doing this for Earth.
[03:34:50.586 --> 03:34:51.867]  But let's go back to Annie.
[03:34:51.987 --> 03:34:54.249]  Annie in Indiana, they call it awful.
[03:34:55.049 --> 03:35:08.779]  They take the intestines, the things they can't put in hot dogs, they take dead animals, a lot of veterinary clinics sell, this is mainstream news, sell your dead dogs and cats, and they grind them up, and then that's what's fed to your dog.
[03:35:09.319 --> 03:35:12.641]  And so if you think humans are being fed bad stuff, the dog can't talk.
[03:35:12.661 --> 03:35:15.683]  That's why most dogs don't want to eat dog food, or they were given real food.
[03:35:16.384 --> 03:35:20.547]  And, you know, it's just better if you're going to have a dog to cook for them, that's what we do.
[03:35:21.467 --> 03:35:27.191]  And there are some smaller dog food brands out there that are healthier, but do you want to comment on what she's talking about her animal having?
[03:35:27.291 --> 03:35:30.133]  Allergies because of GMO diet it's eating well.
[03:35:30.153 --> 03:35:43.623]  I think she's on the right track Everything you said is right on Alex there you can't go with mainstream dog food brands But I just I appreciate the fact that Annie is paying attention to the health of her dog if parents did that with their babies and
[03:35:43.803 --> 03:35:45.604]  Not just with their pets, but their kids as well.
[03:35:45.624 --> 03:35:48.786]  I'm sure Annie pays attention to her children's health, if she has children.
[03:35:49.447 --> 03:35:56.631]  But if more parents around the country would pay attention to their children's health and get them on healthy food, then we would be better off as a country.
[03:35:56.891 --> 03:36:01.494]  We'd be more productive, we would live longer, we'd have greater happiness, greater health.
[03:36:01.514 --> 03:36:02.355]  That's extremist.
[03:36:02.755 --> 03:36:02.995]  I know.
[03:36:03.536 --> 03:36:03.956]  I admit it.
[03:36:05.057 --> 03:36:08.159]  Look, feeding a baby 52% corn syrup is good.
[03:36:09.019 --> 03:36:10.160]  Annie, does that answer your question?
[03:36:10.862 --> 03:36:20.927]  Yes, and I was hoping you could maybe comment on any nutrients like Omega-3s, and I have heard brand names of the Honest Kitchen and Newman's Own for dry dog foods.
[03:36:21.007 --> 03:36:26.909]  I can't find any that will sell wholesale, and I'm trying to find them locally in the stores.
[03:36:26.989 --> 03:36:28.370]  Both of those brands are really good.
[03:36:29.130 --> 03:36:30.411]  Honest Kitchen's good.
[03:36:30.491 --> 03:36:31.832]  Lisa Newman's brand is really good.
[03:36:31.912 --> 03:36:33.612]  Asmira is a good brand.
[03:36:33.833 --> 03:36:37.634]  But Omega-3s and fish oils are really, really healthy for pets, just as they are for humans.
[03:36:38.535 --> 03:36:38.895]  Okay.
[03:36:39.895 --> 03:36:41.035]  Thank you so much, Annie.
[03:36:41.416 --> 03:36:43.897]  Ruth in Louisiana, you're on the air with the Health Ranger.
[03:36:45.137 --> 03:36:46.157]  Yes, hello.
[03:36:46.177 --> 03:36:46.718]  Hi, Ruth.
[03:36:46.838 --> 03:36:47.518]  How you doing?
[03:36:48.058 --> 03:36:51.099]  Look, I have a question for Mike.
[03:36:52.760 --> 03:36:54.020]  I have chronic migraines.
[03:36:54.861 --> 03:37:06.265]  I'm looking into chelation to get the mercury out of my system because I used to have a whole bunch of, that were filling.
[03:37:07.110 --> 03:37:18.235]  But I wanted to do it naturally, and I was looking up, like, chlorella and cilantro to see whether or not that could bind from the mercury of flushing it out of my system.
[03:37:18.255 --> 03:37:18.935]  Cilantro?
[03:37:19.055 --> 03:37:20.376]  An herb that grows in the yard?
[03:37:20.556 --> 03:37:21.456]  That's evil.
[03:37:22.997 --> 03:37:23.797]  Well, she's on the right track.
[03:37:23.817 --> 03:37:24.918]  Cilantro is really great.
[03:37:25.038 --> 03:37:29.080]  It binds with mercury, and just as chlorella does... Well, that's good, because I love it.
[03:37:29.560 --> 03:37:30.540]  Yeah, it's really good.
[03:37:31.200 --> 03:37:32.441]  But you're on the right track there, Ruth.
[03:37:33.601 --> 03:37:36.842]  But I do want to say, I'm not a doctor, and so I can't offer a diagnosis.
[03:37:36.882 --> 03:37:46.684]  However, there are some great naturopaths who are well aware of mercury poisoning detox systems that work, and they do involve some of the nutrients that you already mentioned.
[03:37:47.244 --> 03:37:47.344]  Ah!
[03:37:48.144 --> 03:37:48.924]  Anything else, Ruth?
[03:37:49.904 --> 03:37:57.786]  Is there a certain site that I could go to that you'd feel that would be better than others?
[03:37:58.612 --> 03:38:01.774]  Well, I would just look for organic chlorella.
[03:38:01.994 --> 03:38:02.574]  It's out there.
[03:38:02.655 --> 03:38:04.316]  It's on many, many retailer sites.
[03:38:05.156 --> 03:38:06.137]  Just Google it.
[03:38:06.677 --> 03:38:09.799]  Find a source that you trust and buy organic.
[03:38:09.819 --> 03:38:17.524]  Yeah, I mean, if you find a site and you're not sure, just put the name of their site or their product in and do consumer reviews and Angie's List.
[03:38:17.564 --> 03:38:24.028]  I mean, a lot of times if something's good, you'll see positive reviews, but if something's bad, you know you're going to see stuff about it.
[03:38:24.844 --> 03:38:27.546]  Yeah, I don't know if it's okay if I plug a couple of companies that I know, Alex.
[03:38:27.566 --> 03:38:27.947]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:38:28.147 --> 03:38:36.574]  Well, okay, well then John Barron's Baseline Nutritionals is a really good source for detox, as well as Ed Group's Global Healing Center dot com.
[03:38:37.675 --> 03:38:38.035]  Alright.
[03:38:38.755 --> 03:38:39.916]  Alright, thank you so much, Ruth.
[03:38:39.936 --> 03:38:40.997]  Hope that helps you.
[03:38:41.237 --> 03:38:42.478]  Let's talk to Tim in Nevada.
[03:38:42.498 --> 03:38:43.980]  Tim, you're on the air with the Health Ranger.
[03:38:45.034 --> 03:38:49.496]  Hey, Alex, this is the former TSA guy that talked to you the other day.
[03:38:49.536 --> 03:38:52.438]  Yeah, and I've since confirmed that they're calling him in with questionnaires.
[03:38:52.578 --> 03:38:53.478]  Didn't I tell you?
[03:38:53.638 --> 03:38:54.239]  I told you.
[03:38:54.699 --> 03:39:01.562]  No, no, you told us, but then I went and actually did some research and saw others complaining about it, that they're laying off TSA, firing him.
[03:39:01.903 --> 03:39:04.384]  They call him in and say, do you mind running the body scanners?
[03:39:04.844 --> 03:39:06.425]  Do you have a concern with, you know, radiation?
[03:39:06.745 --> 03:39:09.386]  And if you're smart and say, yeah, I do, they go, thank you.
[03:39:09.887 --> 03:39:10.747]  Here's your pink slip.
[03:39:11.267 --> 03:39:12.568]  We'll find somebody who's stupid.
[03:39:12.928 --> 03:39:13.749]  What's on your mind, Tim?
[03:39:14.409 --> 03:39:16.150]  You guys are having an awesome show today.
[03:39:16.190 --> 03:39:21.114]  I just wanted to call in and tell Mike and you, Alex, I've educated my son so well.
[03:39:21.154 --> 03:39:22.395]  He's 13 years old now.
[03:39:23.015 --> 03:39:31.321]  I had him when I was in high school and he just does not, uh, you know, like all the things that's going on, but he really loves you guys.
[03:39:31.401 --> 03:39:35.864]  He knows everything about GMO vaccines, high fructose corn syrup, everything.
[03:39:35.884 --> 03:39:40.107]  And it's, it's all due to you guys and me, his dad and, and, uh,
[03:39:41.027 --> 03:39:45.490]  He just, every day that I go to see him, he's like, Dad, did you watch Alex's show today?
[03:39:45.550 --> 03:39:47.531]  Did you hear about this?
[03:39:47.571 --> 03:39:48.272]  Did you hear about that?
[03:39:48.312 --> 03:40:02.721]  He even knows so much about GMO crops that he knows, he watched the film about how to, he watched the film on your channel on how to find GMO foods in the stores by product numbers.
[03:40:03.710 --> 03:40:05.211]  Um, this kid is so smart.
[03:40:05.311 --> 03:40:10.213]  Wow, it sounds like he may be, may be some kind of extremist that he reads labels.
[03:40:11.273 --> 03:40:12.293]  That is pretty extreme.
[03:40:13.474 --> 03:40:14.234]  That's awesome.
[03:40:14.274 --> 03:40:29.440]  My brother's son is almost three years old and he's having problems with speaking right now and, um, that just goes to prove what Alex is saying about, you know, the conspiracy theory of the future of, oh my God, you know, if human beings can actually speak, that's a conspiracy theory.
[03:40:30.396 --> 03:40:32.119]  You know, the kid's three years old.
[03:40:32.179 --> 03:40:33.140]  He's a healthy baby.
[03:40:33.220 --> 03:40:35.884]  There's never really been anything wrong with him, but maybe...
[03:40:37.053 --> 03:40:42.676]  Uh, some of the vaccinations that my brother gave him that I tried to warn him against, and some of the GMO foods, and some of the chemicals.
[03:40:42.696 --> 03:40:44.437]  No, I mean, listen, the IQ's dropping.
[03:40:45.077 --> 03:40:58.023]  And children that have been vaccinated, and they're piling more and more on, I mean, they admitted Gardasil was killing girls that took it to trials, and they just approved it, and a bunch of people died, and it goes on the news, crying mothers and dead cheerleaders, and the government just says, that's the way it is!
[03:40:58.043 --> 03:40:59.603]  Hey, you're dying to D.U.?
[03:40:59.663 --> 03:41:00.004]  Good!
[03:41:00.044 --> 03:41:00.644]  Go die!
[03:41:01.178 --> 03:41:11.547]  I just want to say good job being a parent, Tim, because I think your child and children from parents like you are going to represent the future of the human race.
[03:41:11.567 --> 03:41:14.269]  The future of civilization is going to be in their hands.
[03:41:14.950 --> 03:41:15.630]  Kids who can think.
[03:41:15.751 --> 03:41:16.691]  Kids who can stay healthy.
[03:41:16.711 --> 03:41:25.999]  But they know we're getting away from their systems so they're now coming out with mobile x-rayers where the cops are literally going to taser you if you don't walk through their radiation machine.
[03:41:26.039 --> 03:41:26.220]  Yeah.
[03:41:26.943 --> 03:41:28.103]  I mean, I mean, it's pure evil.
[03:41:28.144 --> 03:41:29.084]  It's total insanity.
[03:41:29.324 --> 03:41:30.044]  God bless you, Tim.
[03:41:30.064 --> 03:41:30.685]  Moving quick here.
[03:41:30.745 --> 03:41:31.585]  Diane in Texas.
[03:41:31.605 --> 03:41:32.105]  You're on the air.
[03:41:33.546 --> 03:41:33.946]  Hey, guys.
[03:41:33.966 --> 03:41:34.606]  Great show.
[03:41:35.006 --> 03:41:38.588]  Mike, I get your newsletter every morning and absolutely love it.
[03:41:39.288 --> 03:41:41.129]  I have a question about water.
[03:41:41.329 --> 03:41:42.850]  We're going to be building a house.
[03:41:44.010 --> 03:41:48.272]  It'll be in a rural area, and so I have the option of a well.
[03:41:49.236 --> 03:41:58.645]  Or a rainwater catchment system, or the, um, not the city water, but the county water line with a whole house filter.
[03:41:58.665 --> 03:41:59.005]  Uh-huh.
[03:41:59.706 --> 03:42:10.937]  And, you know, now with all the chemtrails and the gulf cleanup oil tick toxins in the air, what is your better choice for clean water?
[03:42:10.957 --> 03:42:11.978]  Whatever you do, you filter it.
[03:42:12.679 --> 03:42:13.359]  Well, absolutely.
[03:42:13.380 --> 03:42:17.642]  I would find a neighbor who's got a well, ask if you can test their water.
[03:42:17.682 --> 03:42:20.864]  If that test's clean and free of pesticides, then drill a well.
[03:42:21.365 --> 03:42:23.126]  Because that's a source that you can control.
[03:42:23.786 --> 03:42:25.207]  And you can't control what's in the air.
[03:42:25.768 --> 03:42:27.929]  And that could affect catchment systems.
[03:42:28.109 --> 03:42:32.372]  And you obviously can't control what comes out of the county or city water systems.
[03:42:32.913 --> 03:42:38.937]  And you can't really guarantee that those are going to work in the case of an infrastructure failure, whether it's short-term or long-term.
[03:42:39.277 --> 03:42:42.279]  So I would go with a well, go with a DC pump that's solarized,
[03:42:42.619 --> 03:42:45.761]  So you can drive it with the sun.
[03:42:45.841 --> 03:42:47.202]  Diane, don't listen to him.
[03:42:47.222 --> 03:42:50.624]  I recommend, we're going to give you a document cam shot of this.
[03:42:51.484 --> 03:42:57.808]  We have Ozarka fluoride water for kids, and then we have HEB with added fluoride for children.
[03:42:57.828 --> 03:43:00.969]  I'm going to show folks a document cam shot of that.
[03:43:01.470 --> 03:43:02.250]  Do not listen to him.
[03:43:02.290 --> 03:43:03.251]  Don't filter your water.
[03:43:04.051 --> 03:43:10.498]  The government tens of thousands of times has killed people in secret tests, put cancer viruses in vaccines, CNN news today.
[03:43:12.019 --> 03:43:12.520]  Trust them.
[03:43:12.720 --> 03:43:17.425]  I mean, you know, when they... It doesn't matter if all the studies show this massively increases cancer.
[03:43:18.285 --> 03:43:19.326]  Listen, don't listen.
[03:43:20.488 --> 03:43:21.429]  Trust the government.
[03:43:21.469 --> 03:43:22.650]  Trust these good companies.
[03:43:22.690 --> 03:43:23.731]  Drink fluoride, ma'am.
[03:43:23.851 --> 03:43:24.532]  I appreciate your call.
[03:43:26.283 --> 03:43:26.403]  What?
[03:43:26.443 --> 03:43:26.963]  I mean, come on.
[03:43:26.983 --> 03:43:27.503]  Awesome.
[03:43:28.164 --> 03:43:29.444]  Uh, well... I mean, this is sick!
[03:43:30.184 --> 03:43:31.985]  Telling people to have well water.
[03:43:32.065 --> 03:43:33.265]  Maybe they're gonna say... How about freak?
[03:43:33.445 --> 03:43:34.806]  Hold on, how about freak are you?
[03:43:34.946 --> 03:43:36.186]  It's... Yeah, I know.
[03:43:36.366 --> 03:43:36.986]  It's pretty crazy.
[03:43:37.046 --> 03:43:40.147]  Our babies should have clean water, breast milk, sunshine... No!
[03:43:40.447 --> 03:43:40.888]  Dirt!
[03:43:41.488 --> 03:43:43.508]  52% corn syrup and fluoride!
[03:43:44.349 --> 03:43:45.249]  I say more dirt, Alex.
[03:43:45.879 --> 03:43:49.440]  Hey, listen, roach poison is... many brands are part fluoride.
[03:43:49.460 --> 03:43:50.761]  That's obviously for a baby.
[03:43:51.561 --> 03:43:52.342]  Come on, man!
[03:43:52.442 --> 03:43:54.783]  You gotta do a whole... Our kids deserve more!
[03:43:55.363 --> 03:44:02.146]  Well, they're gonna get more, because next time... Next you're gonna tell me... Next you're gonna tell me that ten times a chest x-ray...
[03:44:03.106 --> 03:44:05.747]  That's what they have with these mobile vans looking through your wall.
[03:44:05.987 --> 03:44:08.508]  It is A, bad for you and B, a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[03:44:08.528 --> 03:44:12.689]  The Fourth Amendment says mobile radiation vans will look through your walls.
[03:44:12.809 --> 03:44:13.509]  That's freedom.
[03:44:13.809 --> 03:44:16.110]  I have a right to be surveilled on the toilet.
[03:44:17.371 --> 03:44:19.451]  Well, I'm going to disagree with you on that one.
[03:44:20.752 --> 03:44:21.512]  Totally sick.
[03:44:22.772 --> 03:44:23.753]  See, I'm starting to like this.
[03:44:23.773 --> 03:44:24.873]  I'm going to start seeing from their view.
[03:44:25.768 --> 03:44:27.810]  We could do that show, actually.
[03:44:29.252 --> 03:44:33.277]  What's wrong with some of these troops complaining about experimental shots being given to them?
[03:44:34.158 --> 03:44:39.704]  It's wrong to tell troops that DU has a four and a half or five and a half billion year half-life and it kills them.
[03:44:40.413 --> 03:44:41.054]  That's good!
[03:44:41.134 --> 03:44:42.094]  Dying is good!
[03:44:42.114 --> 03:44:43.856]  What's wrong with you people?
[03:44:43.936 --> 03:44:50.180]  You play the FTC and the FDA and I'll be the health ranger and we'll do a show.
[03:44:50.200 --> 03:44:53.042]  We'll do a show about supplements or health.
[03:44:53.082 --> 03:44:55.464]  Yeah, yeah, let's do it in about a month and you can be over the phone.
[03:44:55.804 --> 03:45:01.809]  I gotta play this video and then we're gonna have to say bye to you at the end of it because I'm coming back with some financial news in the last segment, but it's been amazing.
[03:45:02.529 --> 03:45:06.992]  This is go green or we'll kill your kids, says Richard Curtis, eco-propaganda shocker.
[03:45:07.692 --> 03:45:10.715]  And they have released a new video.
[03:45:12.396 --> 03:45:18.220]  And this is like the UT scientist saying he wants everybody to be killed by airborne Ebola.
[03:45:18.540 --> 03:45:19.560]  There's some of that in there.
[03:45:19.961 --> 03:45:20.541]  And here's another one.
[03:45:20.601 --> 03:45:23.363]  ABC website tells kids when they should die to save the earth.
[03:45:23.743 --> 03:45:26.485]  So just everywhere they're teaching people how to kill themselves.
[03:45:26.925 --> 03:45:29.787]  But then they want to put your kid on Prozac to stop them committing suicide.
[03:45:29.987 --> 03:45:32.289]  But the Prozac insert says it causes suicide.
[03:45:32.790 --> 03:45:35.114]  But see, I'm mentally ill because I notice all this.
[03:45:35.674 --> 03:45:35.955]  Okay?
[03:45:36.536 --> 03:45:38.079]  Let's go ahead and play this clip.
[03:45:38.139 --> 03:45:38.940]  Now watch out, folks.
[03:45:38.960 --> 03:45:39.681]  This is violent.
[03:45:39.721 --> 03:45:43.448]  If you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, I'll be giving radio listeners play-by-play.
[03:45:43.488 --> 03:45:43.828]  Here it is.
[03:45:45.256 --> 03:45:49.600]  Right, kids, just before you go, there's a brilliant idea in the air that I'd like to run by you.
[03:45:50.101 --> 03:45:51.001]  Now, it's called 10-10.
[03:45:51.242 --> 03:46:00.710]  The idea is everyone starts cutting their carbon emissions by 10%, thus keeping the planet safe for everyone, eventually.
[03:46:01.051 --> 03:46:07.697]  Now, this hasn't got to be a huge thing, but I would love it if you and your families would think about doing something.
[03:46:07.857 --> 03:46:08.778]  What sort of thing, miss?
[03:46:09.326 --> 03:46:12.807]  More like getting your dad to insulate the loft.
[03:46:13.468 --> 03:46:17.149]  Or taking your next holiday by train instead of flying.
[03:46:17.549 --> 03:46:19.810]  Or buying energy-saving chemicals.
[03:46:20.951 --> 03:46:22.351]  We're thinking of using our car less.
[03:46:22.511 --> 03:46:23.632]  I'll go and cycle to school.
[03:46:23.772 --> 03:46:25.373]  That's fantastic, Jemima.
[03:46:25.933 --> 03:46:30.115]  Now, no pressure at all, but it'd be great to get a sense of how many of you might do this.
[03:46:30.135 --> 03:46:31.535]  Just a rough percentage.
[03:46:31.915 --> 03:46:32.936]  That's fantastic!
[03:46:34.156 --> 03:46:34.836]  And those not?
[03:46:37.638 --> 03:46:38.338]  Philip and Tracy.
[03:46:39.691 --> 03:46:40.753]  Fine, that's absolutely fine.
[03:46:40.933 --> 03:46:41.514]  Your own choice.
[03:46:42.154 --> 03:46:45.238]  Okay, class, thank you so much for today, and I will see you all tomorrow.
[03:46:45.258 --> 03:46:46.860]  Oh, they're not gonna come, so they're gonna die.
[03:46:46.880 --> 03:46:46.921]  Oh!
[03:46:47.461 --> 03:46:53.389]  Just before you go, I just need to press this little button here.
[03:46:57.674 --> 03:46:58.735]  The kids that didn't do it.
[03:46:58.855 --> 03:47:04.261]  Please remember to read chapters 5 and 6 on volcanoes and glaciation.
[03:47:04.661 --> 03:47:05.902]  She murdered the children.
[03:47:06.723 --> 03:47:10.167]  Right, just want to check on that 1010 thing.
[03:47:10.667 --> 03:47:14.611]  Had some brilliant ideas from lots of you, how the firm can cut down emissions by 10%.
[03:47:16.113 --> 03:47:18.776]  Just quick show of hands, everyone who wants to get involved.
[03:47:20.356 --> 03:47:21.376]  And if you don't, they kill you.
[03:47:21.557 --> 03:47:22.797]  That's nearly everybody.
[03:47:22.997 --> 03:47:26.539]  And they're now announcing, top scientists, they want to start killing us.
[03:47:26.599 --> 03:47:28.519]  And now they're just open, saying, yeah, we want to kill people.
[03:47:28.539 --> 03:47:29.800]  There's too many people.
[03:47:30.080 --> 03:47:30.860]  I mean, the folks.
[03:47:33.201 --> 03:47:34.102]  They don't raise their hand.
[03:47:34.162 --> 03:47:34.682]  No problem.
[03:47:35.362 --> 03:47:35.942]  Your choice.
[03:47:36.403 --> 03:47:40.844]  OK, so those of you planning something here or at home should probably get working on it.
[03:47:42.105 --> 03:47:44.046]  And, oh, gorgeous.
[03:47:44.286 --> 03:47:49.228]  Those of you who aren't... Kills them.
[03:47:50.708 --> 03:47:53.131]  Of course they're already killing you with the vaccines and the GMO.
[03:47:53.191 --> 03:47:54.473]  Have a great weekend, everyone.
[03:47:55.093 --> 03:47:56.816]  Little control freaks, they enjoy killing.
[03:47:56.856 --> 03:47:57.697]  It's their power trip.
[03:47:58.277 --> 03:47:58.978]  It's their religion.
[03:47:59.018 --> 03:48:00.060]  Well, hello everyone.
[03:48:00.340 --> 03:48:01.842]  It's great to be back here at Spurs.
[03:48:02.323 --> 03:48:03.764]  So many happy memories for me.
[03:48:04.325 --> 03:48:08.210]  Now they're on a soccer field, they're gonna kill top footballers if they don't agree.
[03:48:08.230 --> 03:48:09.672]  What is this 10-10 thing the club is doing?
[03:48:09.952 --> 03:48:12.894]  Well, it means that we're trying to cut our carbon emissions by 10% this year.
[03:48:12.954 --> 03:48:13.894]  And they've announced!
[03:48:14.375 --> 03:48:17.536]  They're saying, we are eco-fascist, we're gonna kill you if you don't do what we say.
[03:48:17.576 --> 03:48:19.778]  We've changed the floodlights on our lane, so they'll have energy.
[03:48:20.338 --> 03:48:25.241]  Lots of our fans are coming to matches on buses, trains, bikes and stuff, rather than coming by car.
[03:48:25.881 --> 03:48:26.201]  I see.
[03:48:26.962 --> 03:48:28.263]  Whatever, I wouldn't do it.
[03:48:29.083 --> 03:48:31.164]  It seems like distraction from football to me.
[03:48:31.644 --> 03:48:32.685]  That's just fine, David.
[03:48:33.065 --> 03:48:34.026]  You don't have to join in.
[03:48:34.146 --> 03:48:34.846]  Just ignore it.
[03:48:35.227 --> 03:48:35.707]  No pressure.
[03:48:39.531 --> 03:48:40.432]  So they kill him.
[03:48:41.073 --> 03:48:42.895]  Well, let's do some penalties.
[03:48:44.136 --> 03:48:46.539]  And see, this desensitizes you for mass death.
[03:48:46.559 --> 03:48:47.139]  10 out of 10.
[03:48:47.880 --> 03:48:59.453]  Hundreds of thousands of people, schools, businesses, hospitals, movie stars, knitting circles, scout troops, presidents and governments, all tackling climate change in more than 40 countries.
[03:49:01.607 --> 03:49:04.068]  So the message is, we're going to kill you.
[03:49:04.568 --> 03:49:10.609]  But see, these little sneaky slime bags, they don't come and blow you up, unless you're an Iraqi.
[03:49:10.629 --> 03:49:12.029]  They just put it in your food and your water.
[03:49:12.769 --> 03:49:15.970]  And that's what these scientific control freaks love, the enjoyment.
[03:49:16.790 --> 03:49:21.851]  And they had a big meeting with Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, with the Chinese leadership, where they all gave money for eugenics this week.
[03:49:22.511 --> 03:49:24.272]  Health Ranger, in closing, what did you think of that?
[03:49:24.994 --> 03:49:25.795]  Well, that's pretty shocking.
[03:49:25.815 --> 03:49:27.656]  I haven't seen that clip until today.
[03:49:28.217 --> 03:49:30.839]  In my mind, 10-10, I thought that was the non-GMO day.
[03:49:31.079 --> 03:49:33.481]  Because that's what we're gearing up for, 10-10, October 10th.
[03:49:33.641 --> 03:49:36.984]  By the way, before I forget, tell Watson to get this up right now.
[03:49:37.604 --> 03:49:38.945]  Tell Watson to get this.
[03:49:39.245 --> 03:49:43.369]  But see, they move all the good non-GMO stuff under this umbrella to sell it.
[03:49:43.649 --> 03:49:48.393]  But Watson, everybody, get that video on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[03:49:48.953 --> 03:49:52.314]  But I gotta say, you know, I try to live in a sustainable way.
[03:49:52.334 --> 03:49:54.615]  I try to live in a green way myself, personally.
[03:49:54.835 --> 03:49:59.377]  But I don't want someone threatening me to do... No, no, but see, the globalists control every movement.
[03:49:59.677 --> 03:50:08.840]  They come in and poison and kill and destroy, and then say carbon dioxide, which is taxes to them... You wrote about Bill Gates, saying we've got to get rid of humans to lower carbon.
[03:50:09.480 --> 03:50:10.721]  That's exactly... it's his formula.
[03:50:10.801 --> 03:50:14.344]  It's a mathematical formula that he has out there that these globalists have.
[03:50:14.745 --> 03:50:20.690]  You've got to reduce the population in their minds to reduce... Well, that's the overall message is kill people to lower carbon.
[03:50:21.110 --> 03:50:21.430]  It is.
[03:50:21.710 --> 03:50:21.951]  That is.
[03:50:22.031 --> 03:50:22.771]  It's very clear now.
[03:50:22.851 --> 03:50:27.796]  I mean, we're not even... Now you know why I gave a bad review of Avatar.
[03:50:27.916 --> 03:50:33.801]  Because it sells a lot of good ideas, but then with bad ones, and then we sent you info about Mr. Cameron, didn't we?
[03:50:34.381 --> 03:50:34.762]  You did.
[03:50:34.782 --> 03:50:36.443]  I didn't know that about James Cameron.
[03:50:36.523 --> 03:50:38.105]  Some of that info shocked me.
[03:50:39.106 --> 03:50:40.067]  Tell folks what you learned.
[03:50:40.107 --> 03:50:40.808]  He's a big globalist.
[03:50:40.888 --> 03:50:43.670]  Well, it just goes to show, you know, that we can always learn from each other.
[03:50:43.871 --> 03:50:47.214]  And that's why I think it's great to be here in person.
[03:50:47.254 --> 03:50:48.235]  We can share some ideas.
[03:50:48.295 --> 03:50:55.042]  But, you know, some of Cameron's views I thought were very much against what I believe, which is individual freedom.
[03:50:55.442 --> 03:50:56.263]  I believe in the U.S.
[03:50:56.303 --> 03:50:56.984]  Constitution.
[03:50:57.044 --> 03:50:57.805]  Oh, he wants tyranny.
[03:50:58.485 --> 03:51:02.728]  It seems from the information you sent me that he leans in that direction.
[03:51:02.768 --> 03:51:10.954]  Well, at the end of the movie, they have a military coup, and the humans are bad, but other humans join in, and they say, go back to your planet and die.
[03:51:11.414 --> 03:51:13.016]  The message is, we're going to kill you.
[03:51:13.216 --> 03:51:17.519]  But meanwhile, all the big environmentalists now are up on C-SPAN praising the GMO fish.
[03:51:17.999 --> 03:51:22.001]  Real things that hurt the biosphere and hurt the real integrity of the planet.
[03:51:22.361 --> 03:51:23.361]  No, that's not a problem.
[03:51:23.801 --> 03:51:26.963]  It's carbon dioxide, because it's part of the carbon cycle.
[03:51:27.003 --> 03:51:28.563]  If they tax that, they control it all.
[03:51:28.623 --> 03:51:33.485]  Yeah, they're way off track, because the real threat to the environment is the GMO crops.
[03:51:33.605 --> 03:51:37.567]  It is the pharmaceuticals that are destroying, I mean, polluting the water supplies.
[03:51:37.827 --> 03:51:38.647]  The HRT drugs.
[03:51:38.667 --> 03:51:40.348]  The shrimp are committing suicide now.
[03:51:40.748 --> 03:51:42.289]  Did you see where they just swum up to fish?
[03:51:42.709 --> 03:51:43.469]  ABC News?
[03:51:43.850 --> 03:51:44.530]  New Scientist?
[03:51:44.690 --> 03:51:47.171]  Oh, because their nervous systems are all whacked up.
[03:51:47.711 --> 03:51:57.014]  Yeah, well, the truth is we're poisoning the whole planet through pharmaceuticals that are going through our bodies and actually through dental care.
[03:51:57.374 --> 03:52:08.518]  You know, there are many thousands of tons of mercury just being washed downstream from modern dentistry and it's still legal to put mercury in a baby's mouth as long as you call it dentistry.
[03:52:08.798 --> 03:52:12.459]  And it's still legal to feed them this, this fluoride, fluoride water.
[03:52:12.659 --> 03:52:13.199]  Yeah, no, no.
[03:52:13.760 --> 03:52:15.702]  Everybody knows there's problems in the environment.
[03:52:15.722 --> 03:52:17.563]  They take that common sense and use it.
[03:52:18.244 --> 03:52:20.385]  And the Rockefellers are true trailblazers of evil.
[03:52:20.826 --> 03:52:23.108]  Over a hundred years ago, they created the National Parks.
[03:52:23.128 --> 03:52:23.748]  This is on record.
[03:52:23.768 --> 03:52:24.509]  This is on PBS.
[03:52:24.829 --> 03:52:31.034]  They created the conservation, you know, the modern conservation movement as a way to steal property, control people.
[03:52:31.515 --> 03:52:35.198]  But then meanwhile, they're involved in the most environmentally destructive things imaginable.
[03:52:35.598 --> 03:52:37.739]  So they only use it to shut off their competition.
[03:52:37.759 --> 03:52:38.040]  There it is.
[03:52:38.060 --> 03:52:39.701]  Shrimp on Prozac commit suicide.
[03:52:39.721 --> 03:52:50.007]  A study finds that shrimp swimming in Prozac-accumulated water tend to swim towards the light, making them easier prey, and they don't even care about birds and other fish eating them.
[03:52:50.506 --> 03:52:57.930]  Well, it's not surprising that these pharmaceuticals, especially these psychiatric or psychotropic drugs, imbalance our brain function.
[03:52:58.550 --> 03:52:59.951]  And now they're trying to say it's your genes.
[03:52:59.971 --> 03:53:02.853]  A study just a couple of days ago said ADHD.
[03:53:03.233 --> 03:53:05.134]  They now say, oh, it's caused by your genes.
[03:53:05.194 --> 03:53:08.436]  Well, you know, mercury in the shots, they admit, is actually changing our DNA.
[03:53:09.076 --> 03:53:09.636]  Well, exactly.
[03:53:09.656 --> 03:53:19.138]  And, in fact, it's the drugs that children are being given for ADHD that cause their brains not to grow as well, so they have smaller physical brains.
[03:53:19.198 --> 03:53:19.718]  That's admitted.
[03:53:20.258 --> 03:53:20.618]  Exactly.
[03:53:20.658 --> 03:53:33.061]  That shows up on the... Look, they give us rat poison in the name of it being good, and in almost every statistic, once they get you on Prozac or Adderall or any of these drugs, then you get on more and more until you're a zombie.
[03:53:34.061 --> 03:53:39.886]  And the pharmaceutical companies love targeting wealthy people and middle-class people's kids because they got a big checkbook and insurance.
[03:53:40.226 --> 03:53:43.789]  And a wonderful, enlightened child who throws a fit when they're 12.
[03:53:45.117 --> 03:53:48.962]  Twenty years later is literally a zombie talking to themselves on the street corner.
[03:53:49.222 --> 03:53:50.504]  I've gone up and talked to these people.
[03:53:51.265 --> 03:53:55.329]  I found out their backstories and they are just complete brain-dead zombies.
[03:53:55.450 --> 03:53:56.791]  Zombie is exactly the right word.
[03:53:57.212 --> 03:54:04.280]  Sometimes I've used the word drone, but zombie is perfect because their brain function has been suppressed.
[03:54:04.941 --> 03:54:09.584]  Sometimes you can heal them with superfoods, natural substances.
[03:54:09.724 --> 03:54:10.745]  You can reverse some of it.
[03:54:10.845 --> 03:54:11.205]  Exactly.
[03:54:11.225 --> 03:54:12.526]  You can reverse the brain inflammation.
[03:54:12.626 --> 03:54:12.986]  Exactly.
[03:54:13.046 --> 03:54:14.787]  Listen, we've had you for almost two hours.
[03:54:14.847 --> 03:54:18.470]  I want to say bye to you at the end of the show, but I've got to end it here with some financial news.
[03:54:19.410 --> 03:54:20.791]  Please don't leave you and your lovely wife.
[03:54:20.831 --> 03:54:23.753]  I want to say bye to you and also do a quick interview for an upcoming film.
[03:54:24.173 --> 03:54:29.417]  I appreciate you coming in and we're going to eat some pork chops and gravy here in just a minute.
[03:54:29.537 --> 03:54:29.917]  Is that right?
[03:54:30.037 --> 03:54:31.679]  But Mike Adams, thank you for coming in.
[03:54:31.819 --> 03:54:32.720]  Always my pleasure, Alex.
[03:54:32.740 --> 03:54:32.940]  You bet.
[03:54:32.980 --> 03:54:34.182]  Naturalnews.com.
[03:54:34.222 --> 03:54:34.722]  God bless you.
[03:54:34.983 --> 03:54:35.563]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:54:35.603 --> 03:54:36.124]  Great to be here.
[03:54:36.164 --> 03:54:36.384]  You bet.
[03:54:36.404 --> 03:54:37.926]  Good to have you here with us today.
[03:54:38.146 --> 03:54:41.550]  And ladies and gentlemen, there goes the Health Ranger.
[03:54:41.610 --> 03:54:43.392]  This is a four-hour transmission today.
[03:54:43.692 --> 03:54:44.734]  I'll be back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:54:46.215 --> 03:54:48.157]  And I hope you enjoyed that transmission.
[03:54:48.197 --> 03:54:48.858]  Very informative.
[03:54:48.878 --> 03:54:49.598]  Very scary.
[03:54:50.019 --> 03:54:52.961]  But we did try to have some gallows humor to all of it.
[03:54:52.981 --> 03:54:57.425]  That video, Go Green or We'll Kill Your Kids, says Richard Curtis, eco-propaganda shocker.
[03:54:57.705 --> 03:54:59.767]  Paul Watson's getting this up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:55:00.288 --> 03:55:02.290]  Matt Ryan's getting it up at InfoWars.com.
[03:55:02.310 --> 03:55:03.491]  The video, right now.
[03:55:04.171 --> 03:55:08.914]  And we're going to dovetail it with ABC website tells kids when they should die.
[03:55:08.934 --> 03:55:14.076]  I planned to do a video two weeks ago on this and never did it about how they're training people to commit suicide.
[03:55:14.156 --> 03:55:21.640]  I've got to get that video shot today so it can go up next week because this is just this whole agenda is coming out in the open with the eco-fascists.
[03:55:21.660 --> 03:55:24.462]  But I wanted to end the transmission because gold
[03:55:25.302 --> 03:55:28.145]  Has literally hit an all-time high yet again.
[03:55:28.205 --> 03:55:32.750]  Gold settles above $1,317 as traders weigh Fed comments.
[03:55:33.050 --> 03:55:36.273]  The Federal Reserve has announced it is going to print trillions of dollars and give it to itself.
[03:55:36.574 --> 03:55:38.095]  They are going to monetize more debt.
[03:55:38.135 --> 03:55:43.140]  There are riots globally happening right now over taxes being raised, pensions being cut.
[03:55:43.461 --> 03:55:45.002]  It's now coming here to the United States.
[03:55:45.022 --> 03:55:46.063]  That's CNBC.
[03:55:46.464 --> 03:55:47.905]  Gold prices break new highs.
[03:55:47.945 --> 03:55:48.386]  The street
[03:55:49.167 --> 03:55:51.410]  Gold jumps to another record, Wall Street Journal.
[03:55:51.450 --> 03:55:54.093]  Gold futures rise to another record on DollarSkid.
[03:55:54.213 --> 03:55:55.355]  Silver extends rally.
[03:55:56.136 --> 03:55:58.379]  30 plus years in the gold and silver business, tracking it.
[03:55:58.659 --> 03:56:00.502]  Ted Anderson, what does this mean to you?
[03:56:01.266 --> 03:56:02.107]  Well, I mean, I don't know.
[03:56:02.487 --> 03:56:09.871]  Other than Ed from a couple weeks ago, I don't think there's anybody left in this audience that don't think that gold is a better buy than having fiat currency.
[03:56:10.231 --> 03:56:14.033]  I mean, silver just shot up over $22.2217.
[03:56:14.474 --> 03:56:15.794]  Gold jumping up as high as $1,321.80.
[03:56:15.995 --> 03:56:20.657]  It is just a very big reflection of what's going on out there.
[03:56:20.837 --> 03:56:22.879]  Ted, we're not rocket scientists.
[03:56:22.939 --> 03:56:28.802]  When they start devaluing the dollar down to nothing, gold's going to go up because it's being paid for in dollars.
[03:56:29.002 --> 03:56:30.283]  It's not rocket science.
[03:56:30.623 --> 03:56:31.764]  No, that's exactly right.
[03:56:31.804 --> 03:56:32.724]  The dollar's falling.
[03:56:32.744 --> 03:56:34.104]  You can even see that on the charts.
[03:56:34.165 --> 03:56:38.266]  It's falling against other currencies, and the other currencies are falling right along with it.
[03:56:38.686 --> 03:56:47.970]  You know, the thing is, like, gold right now has a floor, a support floor of $1,300, and now the next resistance level is $1,350.
[03:56:48.450 --> 03:56:51.392]  Alex, just last week we were wondering if gold was going to hit $1,300.
[03:56:52.612 --> 03:57:01.399]  I remember saying there on Thursday that I think we'll hit gold at $1,300 an ounce on Friday, and then we hit $1,301, and that was just a guess.
[03:57:01.439 --> 03:57:04.001]  I just knew because it only had a couple more dollars to move.
[03:57:04.401 --> 03:57:12.727]  Now we're looking at $1,300 an ounce as a resistance level, hard to get back behind, and probably going to get through this $1,350 in very short order.
[03:57:14.188 --> 03:57:18.151]  Ted, it's amazing, and you have not raised prices yet from gold and silver.
[03:57:18.191 --> 03:57:19.431]  You bought one that was a lot lower.
[03:57:19.451 --> 03:57:20.832]  You're passing on those savings.
[03:57:20.872 --> 03:57:21.893]  Tell folks the offer.
[03:57:22.093 --> 03:57:26.155]  They've got to say it's the radio special, or they'll pay more, which is still a great price.
[03:57:26.215 --> 03:57:27.336]  Very competitive at Midas.
[03:57:27.616 --> 03:57:32.099]  But these deals Ted's offering in Sunday evening, fire out those offers, Ted Anderson.
[03:57:32.159 --> 03:57:35.120]  Well, I mean, the best thing right now is the Walking Liberty half at $10.50.
[03:57:35.580 --> 03:57:41.603]  And I would definitely take advantage of that Frank at $2.83 and 62 cents, man.
[03:57:41.623 --> 03:57:43.944]  You get a full year subscription to Bob's newsletter.
[03:57:43.964 --> 03:57:45.424]  And a lot of folks have already got that.
[03:57:45.484 --> 03:57:46.825]  I mean, what are Franks by themselves?
[03:57:46.885 --> 03:57:48.865]  Right now, they're at $2.83.62.
[03:57:49.206 --> 03:57:54.648]  You can buy them for that, or you can go online and pick them up for $288 and pay $5 an ounce more.
[03:57:54.748 --> 03:57:57.009]  I mean, the internet prices have already gone up.
[03:57:57.389 --> 03:58:00.650]  It's what's available by calling and saying you're on the Alex Jones Special.
[03:58:01.070 --> 03:58:02.451]  I have to raise prices.
[03:58:02.751 --> 03:58:03.651]  I will on Monday.
[03:58:03.951 --> 03:58:07.572]  And the silver dollars are still at $10.50 with silver blasting through $22.
[03:58:07.612 --> 03:58:09.133]  Where's silver at right now?
[03:58:09.453 --> 03:58:12.214]  Silver right now is at currently $22.10.
[03:58:12.734 --> 03:58:12.214]  $22.10.
[03:58:13.234 --> 03:58:15.835]  You've got silver half dollar at $10.50.
[03:58:15.895 --> 03:58:16.515]  Do the math.
[03:58:16.535 --> 03:58:16.715]  800-686-2237.
[03:58:16.735 --> 03:58:16.835]  800-686-2237.
[03:58:16.935 --> 03:58:19.636]  Support Minus Resources and this radio show.
[03:58:19.676 --> 03:58:20.577]  Though these deals are so good.
[03:58:28.917 --> 03:58:32.881]  It doesn't even really do anything.
[03:58:32.901 --> 03:58:33.121]  800-686-2237.
[03:58:33.501 --> 03:58:34.782]  Back Sunday, live.
[03:58:35.043 --> 03:58:36.504]  My interview with Bob Chapman coming up.
[03:58:36.584 --> 03:58:37.585]  Infowars.com.
[03:58:37.605 --> 03:58:38.666]  See you Sunday, 4 p.m.
[03:58:38.706 --> 03:58:39.046]  Central.
[03:58:42.569 --> 03:58:44.010]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:45.532 --> 03:58:46.533]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:54.035 --> 03:58:54.956]  Tyranny is here.
[03:58:55.296 --> 03:58:58.997]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:58:59.177 --> 03:59:01.478]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:59:01.638 --> 03:59:06.900]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[03:59:07.320 --> 03:59:13.623]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[03:59:14.003 --> 03:59:16.664]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government
