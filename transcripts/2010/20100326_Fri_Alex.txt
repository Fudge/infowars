[00:00:04.983 --> 00:00:09.809]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.391]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.391 --> 00:00:12.312]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:17.158]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.158 --> 00:00:21.203]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.183 --> 00:00:27.765]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:29.126]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:29.126 --> 00:00:31.807]  It is Friday, the 26th day of March, 2010.
[00:00:31.807 --> 00:00:39.630]  You have founded the Temple of Spirit in the InfoWall.
[00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:47.414]  The front lines in the fight to awaken the population of the world to the growing tyranny enveloping our society.
[00:00:49.597 --> 00:00:57.279]  Every day, I'm now just wallowing in incredible news, not even knowing what I want to cover first.
[00:00:57.279 --> 00:01:02.660]  We're going to get into Barack Obama mocking Republicans' Armageddon rhetoric.
[00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.461]  And this is one of their talking points they've been putting out for the last month.
[00:01:06.461 --> 00:01:11.542]  Okay, let's see if the economy goes into depression a day after we pass the bill.
[00:01:11.542 --> 00:01:16.363]  Let's see if it bankrupts doctors and hospitals a day after we sign the bill.
[00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:34.593]  Let's see if it hurts our society when it doesn't even get phased in until later this year and that's just the taxation on the American people and then most of the supposed health care doesn't even go into place and all these regulations and taxes until 2013, 2015, 2018.
[00:01:40.788 --> 00:01:45.611]  And so you have a public that's been taught about instant gratification.
[00:01:45.611 --> 00:01:51.334]  They want instant solutions, or they want to see instant problems, or they say nothing exists.
[00:01:51.334 --> 00:01:55.937]  So this is the amazing mind control going on by these people.
[00:01:57.185 --> 00:02:00.506]  Meanwhile, Obama said you would have your same insurance and your same doctor.
[00:02:00.506 --> 00:02:02.707]  That has been proven as a manifest lie.
[00:02:02.707 --> 00:02:07.609]  It is admitted that children are not given coverage with pre-existing conditions.
[00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:09.429]  You are not getting free health care.
[00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.271]  They're cutting Medicare and Medicaid while pushing tens of millions of more people onto the program.
[00:02:15.271 --> 00:02:16.452]  You heard me right.
[00:02:16.452 --> 00:02:20.713]  Forty plus billion dollars to begin with and cuts every year.
[00:02:20.713 --> 00:02:22.194]  Massive tax increases.
[00:02:25.137 --> 00:02:37.340]  Meanwhile, the New York Times is reporting, what we already knew, but now it's admitted by the government, that this year, Social Security will bring in less than it pays out as the baby boomers retire.
[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.061]  And that's what Obamacare is all about.
[00:02:39.061 --> 00:02:44.842]  It's about lowering the standards of care and what you can get access to, even if you pay for your own insurance.
[00:02:44.842 --> 00:02:46.143]  This is eugenics.
[00:02:46.143 --> 00:02:48.883]  And that's what Tom Daschle wrote about in his book three years ago.
[00:02:48.883 --> 00:02:54.265]  He's the guy that authored the first bill that, and most of that is inculcated into this legislation.
[00:02:55.618 --> 00:02:58.339]  Also we've got all this supposed violence.
[00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:01.620]  Somebody had a gas line cut from their propane tank.
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.480]  A brother of a congressman.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.761]  Probably done by a lawnmower.
[00:03:04.761 --> 00:03:09.202]  That stuff happens all the time and they're saying they think it's terrorist.
[00:03:09.202 --> 00:03:13.143]  One congressman did have a bullet fired into his office.
[00:03:13.143 --> 00:03:18.504]  Most the time this stuff is staged or done by a supporter so they can draw sympathy to themselves.
[00:03:18.504 --> 00:03:19.825]  But there is a lot of anger.
[00:03:19.825 --> 00:03:20.945]  Some of this could be real.
[00:03:22.526 --> 00:03:31.474]  But Congressman Eric Cantor comes out and says, look, we better not give a lot of attention to this, because this is going to generate more.
[00:03:31.474 --> 00:03:33.636]  And that's actually true.
[00:03:33.636 --> 00:03:48.329]  The way the Democrats are hyping this and pushing this, you've got 300 million people in this nation, millions of mentally ill people, and unstable folks, and people that have had enough, and this is giving them the idea to go out and be violent, which is exactly what the Democrats have been wanting.
[00:03:49.522 --> 00:03:58.849]  In the last 3-4 months, I have been telling you that coming up in April, I believe the government is going to stage terror attacks and blame it on Patriot groups.
[00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:59.410]  Tea parties.
[00:04:01.548 --> 00:04:07.632]  And the Joe Stack situation at the IRS building, very suspicious, has all the earmarks of a government operation.
[00:04:07.632 --> 00:04:11.715]  The Pentagon definitely has all the earmarks of a government operation.
[00:04:11.715 --> 00:04:13.856]  I'd say above 90% chance.
[00:04:13.856 --> 00:04:15.177]  Family warned.
[00:04:15.177 --> 00:04:18.059]  Got his gun from a government lockup in Tennessee.
[00:04:18.059 --> 00:04:21.662]  Same lockup that gave the guy that shot up the Nevada federal courthouse.
[00:04:21.662 --> 00:04:23.443]  Got his gun there.
[00:04:23.443 --> 00:04:25.144]  He's on all these psychotropic drugs.
[00:04:25.144 --> 00:04:28.306]  He had been involved in Pentagon programs previously.
[00:04:28.306 --> 00:04:29.287]  Same thing with Joe Stack.
[00:04:30.636 --> 00:04:33.357]  On and on and on.
[00:04:33.357 --> 00:04:37.677]  And the way they were blaming 9-11 Truth within an hour and a half or less.
[00:04:37.677 --> 00:04:40.278]  Look, it's a very important broadcast today.
[00:04:40.278 --> 00:04:42.678]  So many facets of news and information.
[00:04:42.678 --> 00:04:45.519]  A ship has been sunk off the coast of North Korea.
[00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:48.259]  A South Korean vessel with a hundred hands on board.
[00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:51.060]  Looks like the North may have torpedoed it.
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.480]  Things are definitely heating up.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.821]  Obama says he's signing a nuke treaty with the Russians.
[00:04:55.821 --> 00:04:56.281]  We'll be back.
[00:05:00.728 --> 00:05:03.749]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:09.072]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:09.072 --> 00:05:11.133]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:11.133 --> 00:05:16.135]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:16.135 --> 00:05:17.316]  How much do you want?
[00:05:17.316 --> 00:05:18.436]  When do you want it?
[00:05:18.436 --> 00:05:20.317]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:20.317 --> 00:05:21.398]  When will you need it?
[00:05:21.398 --> 00:05:23.599]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:24.939]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:26.240]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.706]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:35.311]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:35.311 --> 00:05:39.135]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:39.135 --> 00:05:40.356]  How much will you need?
[00:05:40.356 --> 00:05:41.257]  We don't know.
[00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:42.359]  How much do you want?
[00:05:42.359 --> 00:05:43.300]  All you can get.
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.101]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:44.361 --> 00:05:47.422]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:05:47.422 --> 00:05:54.964]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:54.964 --> 00:05:56.165]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:05:56.165 --> 00:06:06.148]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:06.148 --> 00:06:09.389]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:10.789]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:14.174]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:14.174 --> 00:06:20.580]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.745]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:06:25.745 --> 00:06:35.754]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:06:35.854 --> 00:06:38.216]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:38.216 --> 00:06:39.798]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:39.798 --> 00:06:42.260]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.382]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:44.382 --> 00:06:49.526]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:49.526 --> 00:06:58.914]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:01.411 --> 00:07:08.100]  Why is drinking pure high alkaline pH water the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:14.509]  Because alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:16.271]  Disease organisms like bacteria
[00:07:18.754 --> 00:07:26.223]  Alkavision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[00:07:26.223 --> 00:07:34.012]  Using Alkavision pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[00:07:34.372 --> 00:07:38.994]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to an alkaline level.
[00:07:38.994 --> 00:07:43.656]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[00:07:43.656 --> 00:07:49.398]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.
[00:07:49.398 --> 00:07:52.419]  That's A-L-K-A Vision dot com.
[00:07:52.419 --> 00:07:53.099]  Or by calling 269-409-1776.
[00:07:53.099 --> 00:07:53.399]  269-409-1776 today!
[00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:08.838]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.838 --> 00:08:11.822]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:19.494 --> 00:08:20.795]  It is Friday, my friends.
[00:08:20.795 --> 00:08:22.456]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:22.456 --> 00:08:26.919]  We've got three hours and 52 minutes spanning out before us.
[00:08:26.919 --> 00:08:30.702]  We're going to have wide-open telephones coming up later in the hour.
[00:08:30.702 --> 00:08:37.106]  Bob Chapman, with his once-a-week visit, will join us to talk about the globalist, fascistic healthcare bill.
[00:08:39.431 --> 00:08:53.175]  We're going to cover the supposed violence and threats against the Democrats and how they're using this as a distraction from the fact that major polls, 80 plus percent of the American people are against this legislation.
[00:08:53.175 --> 00:08:56.416]  The more they learn about it, the more they hate it.
[00:08:56.416 --> 00:08:59.097]  That is all coming up today as well.
[00:09:00.566 --> 00:09:03.849]  Also, South Korean Navy ship hit by torpedo.
[00:09:03.849 --> 00:09:13.777]  A South Korean naval vessel with more than 100 aboard was sinking in waters near North Korea after a suspected torpedo attack.
[00:09:13.777 --> 00:09:21.623]  Continuing, Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to sign new nuclear arms treaty.
[00:09:27.062 --> 00:09:30.805]  The two leaders will meet in Prague next month to sign the agreement.
[00:09:30.805 --> 00:09:38.591]  The White House says the deal would cut the number of deployed weapons by 25 percent.
[00:09:38.591 --> 00:09:42.814]  So that's some of the international news that we're going to be covering today.
[00:09:44.895 --> 00:09:48.316]  Personal income drops across the country.
[00:09:48.316 --> 00:09:52.077]  Personal income in 42 states fell in 2009.
[00:09:52.077 --> 00:09:55.278]  You always get these numbers a few months after the year ends.
[00:09:55.278 --> 00:09:59.240]  The Commerce Department said Tuesday, and remember, that's with a group cooking the books.
[00:10:00.239 --> 00:10:06.703]  Nevada's 4.8% plunge was the steepest as construction and tourism industries took a beating.
[00:10:06.703 --> 00:10:10.986]  Also hit hard Wyoming, where incomes fell by 3.9%.
[00:10:10.986 --> 00:10:15.829]  And they've got big studies out, I've seen the last few months, where most Europeans won't come to the U.S.
[00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:17.190]  now.
[00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:22.633]  Because of the naked body scanners, the harassment, it's easier to fly to China or to places like
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:29.647]  Iran than it is to fly into the United States, which is exactly what our ruling elite want.
[00:10:29.647 --> 00:10:32.391]  They want to shut down the economy.
[00:10:33.263 --> 00:10:45.094]  And any job creation bills they have, or stimulus packages, are only payoffs to select corporations and industries that, well in many cases, are owned by Al Gore.
[00:10:45.094 --> 00:10:50.999]  He owns stock in more than 20 so-called solar energy and wind energy companies.
[00:10:50.999 --> 00:10:54.762]  And I was looking at lists of cities taking taxpayer money to put these in.
[00:10:54.762 --> 00:10:58.485]  In every case, cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching for Al Gore
[00:10:59.468 --> 00:11:01.509]  And for all these people.
[00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:07.171]  I keep seeing these reports in the news about, let's make Congress cut their pay.
[00:11:07.171 --> 00:11:10.032]  You know, the few hundred thousand dollars a year these people make.
[00:11:10.032 --> 00:11:14.014]  They don't spend millions of dollars to get into Congress to get a couple hundred thousand.
[00:11:14.014 --> 00:11:20.416]  They get in there for special interest to pay them off and to get sweetheart deals on the side.
[00:11:20.416 --> 00:11:22.177]  There's many ways they pay off politicians.
[00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:34.759]  Politicians will buy a piece of property, and then some local real estate baron will pay them two, three times what it's worth, or they'll hire their children, or they'll hire their wife.
[00:11:34.759 --> 00:11:39.702]  And it's just, what's so incredible is that now this is all out in the open.
[00:11:39.702 --> 00:11:44.146]  Decades ago, congressmen routinely went to prison.
[00:11:44.146 --> 00:11:50.010]  Every year, different congressmen were convicted and went to prison.
[00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:51.151]  Just countless numbers.
[00:11:51.151 --> 00:11:51.491]  Now, no.
[00:11:53.405 --> 00:12:05.686]  Obama and his group of criminals know the sky's the limit and so they just openly give Congress members, wives, high-paid jobs in the federal government or corporations.
[00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:08.872]  that stand to make money off the health care takeover.
[00:12:08.872 --> 00:12:11.094]  They give them jobs and it's all out in the open.
[00:12:11.094 --> 00:12:17.719]  Daryl Issa, Representative, is calling for a special prosecutor to investigate White House bribery quid pro quo.
[00:12:17.719 --> 00:12:21.662]  So that's some good news right there, but we all need to push for that.
[00:12:21.662 --> 00:12:32.851]  And this morning I just put into a search engine, health care stocks up, insurance, health insurance stocks up, and I found AP, Wall Street Journal,
[00:12:33.792 --> 00:12:35.112]  And two other articles.
[00:12:35.112 --> 00:12:38.753]  There were hundreds there, but I just printed the top four.
[00:12:38.753 --> 00:12:41.974]  I have those in my stack.
[00:12:41.974 --> 00:12:48.115]  Because I keep getting emails and calls saying, where's the proof the insurance companies wrote this?
[00:12:48.115 --> 00:13:00.398]  The insurance companies three months ago were all over the news, and in the Wall Street Journal, if you just want to go do the research, saying, we're going to pull out of the support of this bill if it has a public option.
[00:13:00.398 --> 00:13:01.278]  Remember that whole fight?
[00:13:02.674 --> 00:13:07.778]  They wrote the original bill that just makes you buy insurance and then allows them to cut the care you get.
[00:13:07.778 --> 00:13:14.464]  And the federal government cuts the Medicare and Medicaid for the people that will be on the supposed free program.
[00:13:14.464 --> 00:13:18.327]  This is a tax, ladies and gentlemen, and a way for the IRS to get involved in your life.
[00:13:18.327 --> 00:13:26.114]  Now, I know the audience knows this, and we have several million very intelligent activist listeners.
[00:13:29.901 --> 00:13:42.567]  And it is so important, day one, early into this new world we're facing of collectivism and tyranny and slavery, and that's what this is, dependency.
[00:13:42.567 --> 00:13:53.492]  It is so essential that day one, we don't let the establishment paint a false portrait here, a false paradigm, a false left-right paradigm.
[00:13:54.724 --> 00:14:10.514]  The mainline Republican host, like a tree full of parrots, or a tree full of monkeys, are chattering and chirping and tweeting the same sheep-like, bleh, bleh, bleh, Obama!
[00:14:10.514 --> 00:14:12.595]  Obama did it!
[00:14:12.595 --> 00:14:16.278]  Obama's a commie!
[00:14:16.278 --> 00:14:19.720]  No socialism!
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.382]  The commies are gonna get us!
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:28.203]  The commies are gonna get us?
[00:14:28.203 --> 00:14:48.094]  Well, it's true, the big central banks fund socialism, communism, and fascism, as Carol Quigley wrote in his seminal work for the elite in 1968, Tragedy and Hope, that they work with anybody who communalizes the general public's wealth to be fed into the elite's hands.
[00:14:48.094 --> 00:14:50.196]  By the way, I have the top communist newspaper
[00:14:51.788 --> 00:14:56.011]  Attacking me, saying 9-11 truth is a right-wing plot.
[00:14:56.011 --> 00:14:58.873]  Really, I thought it was staged by Bush.
[00:14:58.873 --> 00:15:01.715]  And that I'm the founder of it, at least I got one thing right.
[00:15:01.715 --> 00:15:05.218]  And that I'm an evil right-wing demon.
[00:15:05.218 --> 00:15:08.540]  The Communists, totally funded by the Ford Foundation and the banks.
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:12.042]  You make me sick, you dirtbags.
[00:15:12.042 --> 00:15:13.784]  We're going to be talking about that a little bit later, but...
[00:15:19.676 --> 00:15:28.460]  Day one, we have to get it out there that this is a corporate looting masquerading with left cover.
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.621]  That's all it is.
[00:15:30.621 --> 00:15:38.084]  You've got all these idiot Democrats jumping up and down, cheering and screaming and driving around euphorically.
[00:15:38.084 --> 00:15:44.847]  I drove past some woman that had a Texans for Obama sticker and I was stuck in a red light with her and she just looked
[00:15:45.669 --> 00:16:03.144]  Like the archetypal pinhead with coke bottle glasses, dumber than a box of rocks, and then I saw her government parking lot ID hanging off of her mirror, and she's just a moron.
[00:16:03.144 --> 00:16:09.349]  Probably not a bad person, means well, and just stupid.
[00:16:09.349 --> 00:16:11.611]  There were a few Democrats who I disagree with on
[00:16:13.672 --> 00:16:29.101]  Their worldview, but at least they were honest and said, look, Howard Dean, Dennis Kucinich, this is a bailout to insurance companies, this cuts Medicare and Medicaid, this doesn't give you a public option, this doesn't cover pre-existing conditions, because that all sounds sweet.
[00:16:29.101 --> 00:16:33.784]  In a perfect world, let's give some people something free, because we're compassionate.
[00:16:33.784 --> 00:16:41.949]  The problem is, you create a giant trough of trillions of dollars, big interests are going to steal it every time.
[00:16:42.964 --> 00:16:59.619]  You send a bunch of money off to a government that lies 99% of the time, that has national security anonymity, and can do whatever they want, what do you think's gonna happen?
[00:16:59.619 --> 00:17:07.906]  Well, they're gonna build a police state up around that program to ensure that they can continue the unpopular program and expand it.
[00:17:09.192 --> 00:17:10.593]  And that's what tyranny is.
[00:17:10.593 --> 00:17:26.107]  People get into government, they start robbing, they start stealing, they hire a bunch of criminals to carry it out for them, they get a bunch of people on their payroll, and then it just grows like a cancer, and your whole country collapses.
[00:17:26.107 --> 00:17:31.352]  It's like going in, they tell you you got a brain tumor the size of a golf ball.
[00:17:31.352 --> 00:17:33.034]  And they're telling you the brain tumor's good for you.
[00:17:34.198 --> 00:17:37.020]  We know 100% of the time what this does.
[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.862]  Collectivism doesn't work if you're the general public.
[00:17:39.862 --> 00:17:41.964]  It works for the elite.
[00:17:41.964 --> 00:17:51.671]  It works for the government armored fortresses and their surveillance and the secret police and all the psychopaths that love the power that comes with an authoritarian system.
[00:17:51.671 --> 00:17:53.232]  They get to control the media.
[00:17:53.232 --> 00:17:54.933]  They get to control the theater.
[00:17:54.933 --> 00:17:56.414]  They get to control film.
[00:17:56.414 --> 00:17:58.035]  They get to control culture.
[00:17:58.035 --> 00:18:01.538]  They get to create a new class structure.
[00:18:01.538 --> 00:18:02.999]  And by the way, Ed Schultz
[00:18:06.636 --> 00:18:11.560]  Has come out and said, well, we've seized healthcare, let's seize the media now.
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:22.388]  They know they're unpopular, they know they're criminal, and he knows he's a kingpin spokesman for these crooks, and he's up there saying, ban free speech on talk radio, shut it all down.
[00:18:22.388 --> 00:18:25.910]  And Cass Sunstein at the White House is saying it, the regulations are.
[00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.772]  And the diversities are saying it.
[00:18:28.772 --> 00:18:31.534]  What, more than 10 of his czars are praising Mao?
[00:18:32.608 --> 00:18:35.609]  They're not playing games, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:35.609 --> 00:18:45.614]  And I saw comments on PrisonPlanet.com where we posted the Ed Schultz audio, going, you disgusting Republican filth, Alex Jones!
[00:18:45.614 --> 00:18:48.415]  How dare you be backing up Rush Limbaugh!
[00:18:53.634 --> 00:18:57.315]  I would back up Dennis Kucinich's free speech.
[00:18:57.315 --> 00:18:59.976]  I don't agree with him saying all handguns should be banned.
[00:18:59.976 --> 00:19:01.457]  I think it's horrible.
[00:19:01.457 --> 00:19:05.078]  But he has a right as a citizen to say that.
[00:19:05.078 --> 00:19:08.159]  And I don't agree with a lot of things Rush Limbaugh does.
[00:19:08.159 --> 00:19:15.442]  He's a partisan hack who doesn't mind tyranny and the Constitution being butchered when it's Republicans doing it.
[00:19:15.442 --> 00:19:18.463]  But he's never called for Democrats to have their free speech taken away.
[00:19:20.888 --> 00:19:28.611]  And I saw those comments on that article, on that post.
[00:19:28.611 --> 00:19:29.712]  And that's why we're in trouble.
[00:19:29.712 --> 00:19:31.712]  They control us through the left-right paradigm.
[00:19:31.712 --> 00:19:34.533]  The right wing is ready to see the left lose their rights.
[00:19:34.533 --> 00:19:38.555]  The left wing is ready to see the right lose their rights.
[00:19:38.555 --> 00:19:42.397]  The left wants to gouge the right eye out.
[00:19:42.397 --> 00:19:45.078]  The right wing wants to gouge the left eye out.
[00:19:45.078 --> 00:19:45.718]  And then you're blind.
[00:19:47.142 --> 00:19:56.533]  We're going to come back and get into all this and how they're hyping a false flag terror attack against the Congress and the government to try to demonize any opposition to the globalist takeover of America.
[00:19:56.533 --> 00:19:58.255]  I've been telling you it's coming.
[00:19:58.255 --> 00:19:58.956]  It's already here.
[00:19:58.956 --> 00:19:59.637]  It's going to get worse.
[00:20:00.845 --> 00:20:04.046]  If you suffer from poor sleep, you've gotta try MyPillow!

[00:21:38.626 --> 00:21:38.946]  I think so.
[00:22:01.701 --> 00:22:05.728]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:22:05.728 --> 00:22:08.994]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:10.397]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:22:11.098 --> 00:22:13.779]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:22:13.779 --> 00:22:20.163]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:22:20.163 --> 00:22:25.705]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:22:25.705 --> 00:22:35.350]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:37.812]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:22:37.812 --> 00:22:39.394]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:22:39.394 --> 00:22:41.856]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:22:41.856 --> 00:22:43.979]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:22:43.979 --> 00:22:49.124]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:22:49.124 --> 00:22:54.149]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[00:23:25.182 --> 00:23:25.843]  We're good to go.
[00:23:40.179 --> 00:23:40.419]  I think so.
[00:24:08.672 --> 00:24:13.035]  Alright, I want to go through this step by step.
[00:24:13.035 --> 00:24:17.038]  But I will reiterate.
[00:24:17.038 --> 00:24:34.532]  It is essential that everyone tell everyone they know that this does not cover children with pre-existing conditions.
[00:24:36.354 --> 00:24:43.631]  That much of the Congress and executive branch is exempt from Obamacare law, in the law.
[00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:53.473]  And that this cuts Medicare and Medicaid and that this is not some communist socialist takeover.
[00:24:53.473 --> 00:24:56.574]  Yes, they're socializing your wealth to steal it.
[00:24:56.574 --> 00:25:06.179]  The true nature of collectivism has to be exposed as a creation of the robber baron British class that was then exported worldwide.
[00:25:06.179 --> 00:25:07.219]  This is serfdom.
[00:25:07.219 --> 00:25:08.159]  It is feudalism.
[00:25:08.159 --> 00:25:09.320]  It is slavery.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.341]  But they give us false terms to debate.
[00:25:14.005 --> 00:25:29.649]  Because if you can get the word out to mainline Democrats, who are not bad people, that the insurance companies wrote this, it will be that much easier to repeal.
[00:25:29.649 --> 00:25:35.391]  And conservatives need to understand, they think big corporations and big banks are always good.
[00:25:35.391 --> 00:25:38.452]  And I hear the talk show host offending the poor insurance companies.
[00:25:40.123 --> 00:25:41.724]  Saying the government's taking them over.
[00:25:41.724 --> 00:25:46.427]  No, mega-corporations are merging with the government.
[00:25:46.427 --> 00:25:47.227]  It's fascism.
[00:25:47.227 --> 00:25:57.114]  I mean, if you want to use a term, that's the closest modern term that this applies to, or corporatism.
[00:25:57.114 --> 00:26:01.616]  They're also getting ready to stage more violence, and I didn't just start predicting this this week or last week.
[00:26:01.616 --> 00:26:08.681]  You know, every day, I've been breaking down exactly what's going to happen, because we've seen all the indicators, and I'm going to go over the latest developments on that.
[00:26:09.718 --> 00:26:12.200]  And the Congressman's office reportedly shot.
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.320]  Big international news.
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:20.565]  When Lou Dobbs' house gets shot up, it's in a few New Jersey newspapers, and the media says, oh, I bet he's lying.
[00:26:20.565 --> 00:26:24.967]  Even though state police came out and documented that his home had been shot.
[00:26:24.967 --> 00:26:29.530]  That he was getting death threats.
[00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:32.272]  But first, I want to play this obnoxious clip
[00:26:37.762 --> 00:26:47.110]  I want to play this obnoxious clip of Barack Obama last night, saying, hey, the world didn't end.
[00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:50.392]  We didn't have Armageddon.
[00:26:50.392 --> 00:26:56.777]  And that's a talking point they've had for a while, for several months, that when this passes, let's just see if the stock market crashes.
[00:26:56.777 --> 00:26:58.679]  Let's just see if it is the end of the world.
[00:26:58.679 --> 00:27:00.681]  Let's just see if everybody goes bankrupt.
[00:27:00.681 --> 00:27:03.403]  Knowing full well it's going to take years to phase this in.
[00:27:07.011 --> 00:27:08.132]  Here is Barack Obama.
[00:27:08.132 --> 00:27:13.055]  There's been plenty of fear-mongering, plenty of overheated rhetoric.
[00:27:13.055 --> 00:27:25.602]  If you turn on the news, you'll see the same folks are still shouting about there's going to be an end to the world because this bill passed.
[00:27:25.602 --> 00:27:26.563]  I'm not exaggerating.
[00:27:26.563 --> 00:27:34.167]  Leaders of the Republican Party, they call the passage of this bill Armageddon!
[00:27:34.167 --> 00:27:34.628]  Armageddon!
[00:27:35.899 --> 00:27:42.404]  End of freedom as we know it!
[00:27:42.404 --> 00:27:48.329]  So after I signed the bill, I looked around to see if there were any asteroids falling.
[00:27:48.329 --> 00:27:57.356]  Ha ha ha!
[00:27:57.356 --> 00:28:00.058]  So funny.
[00:28:00.058 --> 00:28:02.100]  Some cracks opening up in the earth.
[00:28:04.977 --> 00:28:07.118]  Turned out it was a nice day!
[00:28:07.118 --> 00:28:09.819]  And out of those cracks came... Birds were chirping.
[00:28:09.819 --> 00:28:11.179]  Tens of thousands of IRS agents.
[00:28:11.179 --> 00:28:12.780]  Folks were strolling down the mall.
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:16.761]  With our, um... People still had their doctors.
[00:28:16.761 --> 00:28:18.762]  Medical records.
[00:28:18.762 --> 00:28:29.946]  From this day forward, all of the cynics, all the naysayers, they're gonna have to confront the reality of what this reform is, and what it isn't.
[00:28:29.946 --> 00:28:30.647]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:28:32.796 --> 00:28:43.519]  Yeah, because you always tell the truth about everything, about not hiring lobbyists and not expanding wars and ending torture and ending the Patriot Act.
[00:28:43.519 --> 00:28:46.260]  You lied about everything.
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:50.681]  And it's on record it doesn't give coverage to children for pre-existing conditions.
[00:28:50.681 --> 00:28:54.002]  It's on record they can still turn anybody down for insurance.
[00:28:54.002 --> 00:28:56.863]  Then you're forced on to the Medicare-Medicaid system
[00:28:57.628 --> 00:29:02.629]  Which conservatively will add 10 to 15 million new people in the next several years.
[00:29:02.629 --> 00:29:08.470]  You cut the funding for that and then send more people into the system.
[00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:10.590]  Mm-hmm.
[00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:21.152]  Kind of like everybody pays into their unemployment insurance around the country, but then they're denying more and more unemployment claims.
[00:29:21.152 --> 00:29:26.213]  You talk about fear-mongering, you're the Democrats that say all our cities on the coast will flood and
[00:29:27.642 --> 00:29:29.263]  Flowers won't smell good anymore.
[00:29:29.263 --> 00:29:31.684]  That's actually mainstream news.
[00:29:31.684 --> 00:29:35.506]  And that we're all going to be dead if we don't pay you and Al Gore a bunch of money.
[00:29:35.506 --> 00:29:38.687]  And then it turns out it's all a premeditated lie.
[00:29:38.687 --> 00:29:39.668]  No.
[00:29:39.668 --> 00:29:50.973]  The scores of new taxes and regulations and the government making you buy something from a private company, that is the opposite of the American way and that is Armageddon to our Republic.
[00:29:50.973 --> 00:29:52.354]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.354 --> 00:29:53.875]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.878 --> 00:30:00.662]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.662 --> 00:30:07.306]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:30:07.306 --> 00:30:12.450]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:21.175]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:30:21.175 --> 00:30:23.137]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:30:25.285 --> 00:30:27.495]  I guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:30:29.537 --> 00:30:34.259]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:30:34.259 --> 00:30:38.081]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[00:30:38.081 --> 00:30:39.342]  Others don't.
[00:30:39.342 --> 00:30:41.483]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:30:41.483 --> 00:30:43.264]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:30:43.264 --> 00:30:46.145]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:30:46.145 --> 00:30:52.769]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:30:52.769 --> 00:30:55.470]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:57.851]  Diamond Gusset Jeans, got it.
[00:30:57.851 --> 00:30:58.712]  Others don't.
[00:31:02.196 --> 00:31:06.225]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:31:06.225 --> 00:31:09.472]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:31:09.472 --> 00:31:10.894]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:31:11.596 --> 00:31:14.258]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:31:14.258 --> 00:31:20.641]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:31:20.641 --> 00:31:26.204]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:31:26.204 --> 00:31:35.969]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:31:35.969 --> 00:31:38.311]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:31:38.311 --> 00:31:39.891]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:31:39.891 --> 00:31:40.772]  And the Congress is saying,
[00:31:41.132 --> 00:31:42.333]  Who do we make the check out to?
[00:31:42.333 --> 00:31:44.195]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:31:44.195 --> 00:31:49.621]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:31:49.621 --> 00:31:58.730]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:32:01.388 --> 00:32:04.392]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:32:04.392 --> 00:32:09.740]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:11.783]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:32:11.783 --> 00:32:16.790]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:17.070]  How much
[00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:17.950]  How much do you want?
[00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:19.071]  When do you want it?
[00:32:19.071 --> 00:32:20.952]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:32:20.952 --> 00:32:22.032]  When will you need it?
[00:32:22.032 --> 00:32:24.233]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:32:24.233 --> 00:32:25.573]  Will there be any food?
[00:32:25.573 --> 00:32:27.094]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:32:27.094 --> 00:32:32.376]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:32:32.376 --> 00:32:35.958]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:32:35.958 --> 00:32:39.779]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:32:39.779 --> 00:32:41.000]  How much will you need?
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:41.900]  We don't know.
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:43.000]  How much do you want?
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:43.941]  All you can get.
[00:32:43.941 --> 00:32:44.321]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:32:45.021 --> 00:32:45.241]  I think?
[00:33:09.215 --> 00:33:12.416]  Personal income drops across the country.
[00:33:12.416 --> 00:33:15.898]  Social Security to see payout exceed pay-in.
[00:33:15.898 --> 00:33:18.799]  This year, New York Times.
[00:33:18.799 --> 00:33:20.060]  Dow Jones Newswire.
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:23.281]  Healthcare stocks up after House okays Obamacare.
[00:33:23.281 --> 00:33:24.962]  It passed the House and Senate.
[00:33:24.962 --> 00:33:28.003]  It's going to Obama's desk today.
[00:33:28.003 --> 00:33:28.704]  Here's another one.
[00:33:28.704 --> 00:33:32.405]  Healthcare stocks up after House okays overhaul.
[00:33:32.405 --> 00:33:32.685]  U.S.
[00:33:32.685 --> 00:33:35.466]  stocks mostly up as healthcare stocks rise.
[00:33:35.466 --> 00:33:36.167]  Market Watch.
[00:33:37.874 --> 00:33:42.218]  Oh yeah, this was written for the people.
[00:33:42.218 --> 00:33:51.805]  All you foolish collectivists think you've gotten the rich insurance companies who wrote the lobbying talking points attacking themselves.
[00:33:51.805 --> 00:33:53.807]  Get the insurance companies.
[00:33:53.807 --> 00:33:54.688]  Pass it.
[00:33:54.688 --> 00:33:56.069]  You're gonna win.
[00:33:56.069 --> 00:33:58.731]  You're gonna get some free goodies.
[00:33:58.731 --> 00:34:05.076]  And mindless collectivists were like, yeah, we're showing everybody.
[00:34:05.076 --> 00:34:07.098]  Oh, you're gonna, you're gonna show them.
[00:34:08.257 --> 00:34:12.161]  And you don't practice medicine, so you're not going to understand your care has been cut.
[00:34:12.161 --> 00:34:14.424]  You're going to get the equivalent of VA hospital care.
[00:34:14.424 --> 00:34:21.211]  I was reading a story this morning about a guy who had a heart attack, and they never even put a stethoscope to his chest.
[00:34:21.211 --> 00:34:23.693]  A veteran.
[00:34:23.693 --> 00:34:28.579]  You're going to get VA quality health care now, but you'll never know, you'll never care, because you think you won.
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:31.881]  And then it'll all be about Obama.
[00:34:31.881 --> 00:34:33.342]  How Obama did this.
[00:34:33.342 --> 00:34:35.043]  Obama the commie.
[00:34:35.043 --> 00:34:36.663]  And then Obama will leave office.
[00:34:36.663 --> 00:34:39.925]  The Republicans will keep most of this in place.
[00:34:39.925 --> 00:34:46.949]  Just like all the other collectivizing initiatives that Democrats have passed, Republicans keep.
[00:34:46.949 --> 00:34:50.631]  One of the most draconian presidents was Nixon with all of his socialism.
[00:34:50.631 --> 00:34:52.792]  But that was okay because he was a Republican.
[00:34:52.792 --> 00:34:54.053]  Just like Schwarzenegger.
[00:34:54.053 --> 00:34:55.513]  Oh, he's anti-gun.
[00:34:55.513 --> 00:34:56.454]  He's pro-open border.
[00:34:56.454 --> 00:34:57.234]  But that's okay.
[00:34:57.234 --> 00:34:58.355]  He's a Republican.
[00:35:03.871 --> 00:35:11.415]  And like Obama said, the birds are chirping, everybody's walking down the street, everything's pretty, it's springtime.
[00:35:11.415 --> 00:35:15.777]  They're gonna do this incrementally, and that's their plan.
[00:35:15.777 --> 00:35:23.881]  And I think that all of the research and all of the protesting and all of the phone calls will just subside and go away.
[00:35:23.881 --> 00:35:24.421]  And they'll have
[00:35:25.851 --> 00:35:31.574]  With these attorney generals from now 12 states joining together to sue, they'll put a ringer in there.
[00:35:31.574 --> 00:35:36.337]  We'll get political payoffs and rise to the power structure.
[00:35:36.337 --> 00:35:37.918]  They'll throw that lawsuit.
[00:35:37.918 --> 00:35:42.040]  That's why you got to pass state laws against it.
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:51.125]  You've got to file private lawsuits because of how this legislation discriminates and lets some of the unions be exempt from the Cadillac health care tax.
[00:35:54.645 --> 00:35:59.608]  Now, shifting gears into violence.
[00:35:59.608 --> 00:36:13.657]  I have no doubt that some of the violent phone calls, some of the threatening phone calls, some of the threatening emails, some of the defacing of Democratic Party offices around the country is real.
[00:36:13.657 --> 00:36:16.579]  People are angry when that happens.
[00:36:16.579 --> 00:36:18.881]  And it lets these criminals play the part of victims.
[00:36:20.267 --> 00:36:30.450]  But there's no doubt from past activities that we've seen from these people that some of this is staged, and you can't really believe anything they're saying.
[00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:46.215]  And I have seen the ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, Media Matters, George Soros' outfits in the last year, but intensifying the drumbeat the last few months, saying there will be terror attacks launched by the Tea Party groups, by the Birthers, and by 9-11 Truth,
[00:36:47.742 --> 00:36:50.724]  They've even had Glenn Beck out there putting this out.
[00:36:50.724 --> 00:36:51.585]  He knows it's coming.
[00:36:51.585 --> 00:37:12.499]  He's distancing himself from it as a way to turn all this around and not discuss what's in the bill, but to instead sell what Homeland Security's already been training for secretly, the demonization of the American people.
[00:37:13.902 --> 00:37:16.624]  The demonization of anyone that criticizes them.
[00:37:16.624 --> 00:37:21.087]  They're in the media today saying, how dare Sarah Palin criticize the health bill?
[00:37:21.087 --> 00:37:23.248]  It's causing dangerous hate.
[00:37:23.248 --> 00:37:27.111]  She's got to have her speech restricted.
[00:37:27.111 --> 00:37:32.354]  Shultz of MSNBC is running around saying the same thing and that's coming up.
[00:37:34.423 --> 00:37:37.266]  It doesn't matter when Union thugs beat people up.
[00:37:37.266 --> 00:37:41.990]  It doesn't matter when La Raza or Mecha beat people up from California to Florida.
[00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:44.152]  Then it's only on YouTube.
[00:37:44.152 --> 00:37:47.054]  Maybe in the local newspaper, but never a big national issue.
[00:37:47.054 --> 00:37:54.441]  When Lou Dobbs' house gets shot up, it was in one or two newspapers in New Jersey.
[00:37:54.441 --> 00:37:56.583]  And then meanwhile, you have this Homeland Security
[00:37:58.035 --> 00:38:02.796]  Today article, new vigilance needed in wake of healthcare vote.
[00:38:02.796 --> 00:38:09.557]  This came out four days ago before all of this even started, which shows more evidence of this being staged.
[00:38:09.557 --> 00:38:20.120]  And then they link to the right-wing extremism, current economic and political climate fueling, resurgence and radicalization and recruitment.
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:26.341]  This is the report from a year ago that we were given by law enforcement.
[00:38:27.711 --> 00:38:29.032]  See, they had all this set up.
[00:38:29.032 --> 00:38:31.133]  People were like, where's the violence a year ago?
[00:38:31.133 --> 00:38:39.197]  They knew that the unconstitutional criminal things they're doing would elicit a radicalization because they are radical.
[00:38:39.197 --> 00:38:41.458]  And then now you've got them all over the news, all scared.
[00:38:41.458 --> 00:38:42.178]  Oh my gosh.
[00:38:42.178 --> 00:38:45.060]  And I heard Fox News this morning on XM driving into work.
[00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:49.422]  They were saying, oh, it is terrible that some people are throwing bricks through windows.
[00:38:49.422 --> 00:38:51.283]  Oh my gosh, we've got to act like adults.
[00:38:51.283 --> 00:38:54.925]  And we're going to see the Republicans and Democrats have a joint press conference today.
[00:38:58.291 --> 00:39:02.674]  Talk about how we all need to get along.
[00:39:02.674 --> 00:39:13.302]  Shifting the debate away from what's in the bill to how anyone that criticizes it is linked to terrorism and how the Tea Party's connected in with Al-Qaeda.
[00:39:13.302 --> 00:39:15.223]  White Al-Qaeda is everywhere.
[00:39:15.223 --> 00:39:16.144]  They're going to get us.
[00:39:16.144 --> 00:39:18.305]  We need to use Homeland Security on the American people.
[00:39:18.305 --> 00:39:18.926]  We need to pass
[00:39:20.478 --> 00:39:22.740]  Lindsey Graham's bill that says they can arrest U.S.
[00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:33.768]  citizens without even any suspicion for any reason and quote, have enhanced interrogation by the Pentagon and it will take an act of Congress to ever get you released from prison.
[00:39:33.768 --> 00:39:36.270]  No judge, no jury, no indictment.
[00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:41.754]  I mean, they actually have bipartisan legislation to turn America into an open gulag.
[00:39:41.754 --> 00:39:45.837]  They're building FEMA camps everywhere, the National Emergency Centers Act.
[00:39:46.837 --> 00:39:50.940]  They admit in Homeland Security drills they're going to use sports stadiums and other facilities.
[00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:57.785]  And then they come out and say, but it's a conspiracy theory that people are worried about this when they have open gulag legislation.
[00:39:57.785 --> 00:40:00.687]  And under the Patriot Act, they can already do these type of things.
[00:40:00.687 --> 00:40:04.450]  And under the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, PDD 51.
[00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:05.010]  Are you listening?
[00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:08.273]  I'm giving you facts here, not rhetoric, not opinion.
[00:40:09.682 --> 00:40:14.304]  Under the Enemy Combatant Act, we had constitutional lawyers on, documenting.
[00:40:14.304 --> 00:40:16.605]  That has language where they can grab U.S.
[00:40:16.605 --> 00:40:24.029]  citizens and secretly hold them and torture them.
[00:40:24.029 --> 00:40:32.933]  This is gulag America, out in the open, and they criticize anybody that criticizes what they're doing, and imply it doesn't exist.
[00:40:32.933 --> 00:40:33.273]  It's like,
[00:40:34.975 --> 00:40:39.676]  I had David Rothschild, heir of the Rothschild fortune, on a few years ago.
[00:40:39.676 --> 00:40:41.917]  Got him on, he was promoting a book.
[00:40:41.917 --> 00:40:44.258]  And I said, you guys are planning a carbon tax.
[00:40:44.258 --> 00:40:49.359]  But see, they weren't done yet with the phase of brainwashing the public that something's got to be done for the earth.
[00:40:49.359 --> 00:40:56.501]  All their white papers said that they were going to set up all these carbon taxes to selectively shut down any industry they didn't control.
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:07.285]  And he said, no, there's no tax, even though Al Gore was already in Congress starting the next phase of admitting it.
[00:41:07.285 --> 00:41:15.792]  Then you see him a few months later on television promoting global carbon tax.
[00:41:15.792 --> 00:41:26.922]  Just like they've said for decades, there's no plan for banks to set up a world government and bankrupt nations to bring them under their control, no matter how many IMF World Bank documents we had.
[00:41:26.922 --> 00:41:28.083]  They were busy setting it up.
[00:41:28.083 --> 00:41:29.084]  They were busy building it.
[00:41:30.618 --> 00:41:35.301]  And now, they've got it in place, so they're announcing it and saying it's a good thing.
[00:41:35.301 --> 00:41:37.622]  And what do these Homeland Security reports say?
[00:41:37.622 --> 00:41:45.427]  We're insane, there's no world government, none of this is happening, and if you talk about it, you're a cop killer.
[00:41:45.427 --> 00:41:55.733]  And so, in this report, they link to the MIAC report, they link to the Homeland Security Master Report, they link to the latest Southern Poverty Lawson report that demonizes yours truly.
[00:41:55.733 --> 00:41:57.834]  So every cop in the country is being given this,
[00:41:59.747 --> 00:42:03.148]  And they're reading about how evil I am.
[00:42:03.148 --> 00:42:23.113]  And if you read the big communist newspaper, Challenge, the revolutionary communist newspaper of Progressive Labor Party, one of the biggest, if not the biggest, communist publication in the United States, and who do they single out as the numero uno enemy?
[00:42:23.113 --> 00:42:26.674]  9-11 Truth Movement, a right-wing creation.
[00:42:30.731 --> 00:42:46.524]  The story largely provided by Alex Jones and his modest media empire in Austin, Texas, and then it goes on to basically say that if you believe 9-11 can be an inside job, you're an evil right-winger.
[00:42:46.524 --> 00:42:52.249]  Let me see, we exposed the Bush handlers for staging 9-11, and so we are right-wingers.
[00:42:52.249 --> 00:42:57.153]  You got the left, you got the right, you have the whole establishment coming after Alex Jones.
[00:42:57.153 --> 00:42:57.914]  And why is that?
[00:43:03.035 --> 00:43:04.196]  Why is that?
[00:43:04.196 --> 00:43:08.901]  Because we're effective and we know what we're talking about.
[00:43:08.901 --> 00:43:21.853]  And then they go on to slander me and they say that I put out the protocols of the Elders of Zion and
[00:43:24.116 --> 00:43:33.902]  It's all lies, but see, it doesn't matter if it's David Rothschild, it doesn't matter if it's a communist newspaper, it doesn't matter if it's the Southern Poverty Law Center or ADL, that's what they do.
[00:43:33.902 --> 00:43:42.346]  They're there premeditatedly lying to their moron constituents.
[00:43:42.346 --> 00:43:44.128]  These are people that like to be lied to.
[00:43:44.128 --> 00:43:48.350]  This is people that enjoy sitting there and reading fantasy.
[00:43:52.552 --> 00:43:59.937]  I have never talked about the Elders of Zion connected to 9-11.
[00:43:59.937 --> 00:44:09.523]  Complete and total defamation.
[00:44:09.523 --> 00:44:21.391]  So you've got all these different minions of the establishment, like Shultz, saying,
[00:44:23.647 --> 00:44:26.668]  Selectively, people they don't like.
[00:44:26.668 --> 00:44:29.270]  You've got all these White House officials calling for it.
[00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:32.911]  You've got the government seizing healthcare for private interest.
[00:44:32.911 --> 00:44:40.155]  Cutting Medicare and Medicaid, and you've got the communists cheerleading it and saying, I'm bad.
[00:44:40.155 --> 00:44:41.996]  That's what communist leadership always do.
[00:44:41.996 --> 00:44:43.717]  They always back up the banks.
[00:44:43.717 --> 00:44:47.838]  They always love robbing the dumbed-down mass.
[00:44:47.838 --> 00:44:48.599]  That's all this is.
[00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:53.502]  The only way you protect yourself is by slashing government.
[00:44:53.502 --> 00:44:55.404]  That doesn't mean privatizing.
[00:44:55.404 --> 00:45:02.529]  Just trading one government system for a private corporate government.
[00:45:02.529 --> 00:45:08.073]  So the government can use force at the barrel of a gun for their massive tax increases.
[00:45:08.073 --> 00:45:14.618]  They can have the IRS running your medical records and giving it to whoever they want and fining you if you buy medical coverage they don't agree with.
[00:45:19.005 --> 00:45:26.267]  But then they whine and scream and get all scared when a couple rocks get thrown through some windows and somebody shoots into a congressman's office.
[00:45:26.267 --> 00:45:35.891]  I mean, these same congressmen voted for killing over a million Iraqis in Iraq.
[00:45:35.891 --> 00:45:37.751]  And I'm not saying violence is the way to go.
[00:45:37.751 --> 00:45:44.273]  That's why I've been telling you, they've been setting the stage for staged events.
[00:45:44.273 --> 00:45:45.054]  This is what they did in 1995.
[00:45:48.083 --> 00:45:49.544]  The Feds bombed Oklahoma City.
[00:45:49.544 --> 00:45:51.605]  If you haven't researched that, go look into it.
[00:45:51.605 --> 00:45:53.346]  Absolute proof.
[00:45:53.346 --> 00:45:55.927]  FBI agents' names, who bombed it, who ran it.
[00:45:55.927 --> 00:46:03.091]  It's even come out in mainstream news here and there.
[00:46:03.091 --> 00:46:05.813]  FBI ATF.
[00:46:05.813 --> 00:46:11.836]  Absolute fact.
[00:46:11.836 --> 00:46:15.658]  And criminals do the same things over and over again.
[00:46:15.658 --> 00:46:15.778]  And
[00:46:16.872 --> 00:46:45.622]  There's a lot of pieces of information that go into this, but I'm telling you, late April, from all the TV shows they're producing, the current programming, the buildup, and I told you, you see lots of little events, both real and manufactured, as the preparatory phase, just putting it in the minds, building up to this, and then while you're all distracted by a federal building that's blown up, or a congressman who's shot,
[00:46:48.339 --> 00:46:51.160]  And the Feds will probably pick some federal building that's got a daycare again.
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:55.781]  So they can show some dead kids or bleeding kids.
[00:46:55.781 --> 00:47:00.983]  Then they'll pass their carbon taxes, their amnesty, and everything else, because nobody can criticize them.
[00:47:00.983 --> 00:47:03.404]  After all, you're violent if you do.
[00:47:03.404 --> 00:47:05.364]  You're connected to violent groups.
[00:47:05.364 --> 00:47:07.905]  And so a lot of people will get scared and will stop speaking out.
[00:47:07.905 --> 00:47:09.506]  But this isn't 1995.
[00:47:09.506 --> 00:47:10.806]  This isn't 15 years ago.
[00:47:10.806 --> 00:47:12.626]  It's not going to work, system.
[00:47:12.626 --> 00:47:14.287]  The word's out.
[00:47:14.287 --> 00:47:17.248]  Mainline talk radio's saying the Democrats are staging this.
[00:47:18.666 --> 00:47:20.967]  With no real proof.
[00:47:20.967 --> 00:47:23.088]  Probably are though.
[00:47:23.088 --> 00:47:26.109]  And the jig's up.
[00:47:26.109 --> 00:47:29.651]  So, we're in a fight for our lives here, but we're in the fight.
[00:47:29.651 --> 00:47:30.391]  We've got a chance.
[00:47:33.482 --> 00:47:45.246]  So you expose the healthcare legislation as just a robbery, a vertical integration of industry and a transfer of wealth from the middle class to the elite, and a cutting of the chicken feed benefits to the poor.
[00:47:45.246 --> 00:47:46.766]  But they're the poor.
[00:47:46.766 --> 00:47:47.747]  They're ignorant.
[00:47:47.747 --> 00:47:48.867]  They're dumbed down.
[00:47:48.867 --> 00:47:52.408]  They've been drinking fluoride and getting mercury shots their whole life.
[00:47:52.408 --> 00:47:54.249]  They're not going to know.
[00:47:54.249 --> 00:47:55.909]  You're not going to be able to explain it to them.
[00:47:55.909 --> 00:47:57.330]  You've got to explain it to the middle class.
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:47:59.320]  Somebody who's run a business.
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:01.021]  Somebody who's got some smarts.
[00:48:01.021 --> 00:48:07.363]  And I'm not saying there aren't really smart people that are poor out there, but of the really poor people, a lot of them are fans of this.
[00:48:07.363 --> 00:48:11.945]  They really think that the government wants to give them a goody.
[00:48:11.945 --> 00:48:14.906]  Let's go ahead and play Congressman Eric Cantor.
[00:48:14.906 --> 00:48:17.547]  Here he is, talking about being shot at.
[00:48:17.547 --> 00:48:25.629]  There have been a lot of reports and the potential for violence against members of Congress over the last several days.
[00:48:25.629 --> 00:48:26.630]  Let me be clear.
[00:48:27.902 --> 00:48:30.464]  I do not condone violence.
[00:48:30.464 --> 00:48:39.349]  There are no leaders in this building, no rank-and-file members in this building that condone violence, period.
[00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:49.794]  I've received threats since I assumed elected office, not only because of my position, but also because I'm Jewish.
[00:48:49.794 --> 00:48:54.257]  I've never blamed anyone in this body for that, period.
[00:48:56.494 --> 00:49:12.827]  Any suggestion that a leader in this body would incite threats or acts against other members is akin to saying that I would endanger myself, my wife, or my children.
[00:49:12.827 --> 00:49:16.630]  Just recently, I have been directly threatened.
[00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:23.295]  A bullet was shot through the window of my campaign office in Richmond this week, and I've received threatening emails.
[00:49:24.534 --> 00:49:34.022]  But I will not release them because I believe such actions will only encourage more to be sent.
[00:49:34.022 --> 00:49:39.527]  I want to stress this, and it's very important.
[00:49:39.527 --> 00:49:48.175]  Legitimate threats should be treated as security issues, and they should be dealt with by the appropriate law enforcement officials.
[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:57.324]  It is reckless to use these incidents as media vehicles for political gain.
[00:49:57.324 --> 00:50:17.374]  That is why I have deep concerns that some, DCCC Chairman Chris Van Hollen and DNC Chairman Tim Kaine in particular, are dangerously fanning the flames by suggesting that these incidents be used as a political weapon.
[00:50:19.892 --> 00:50:22.673]  Now, you actually heard some truth there.
[00:50:22.673 --> 00:50:35.699]  When you have real terror attacks or real political violence, the handbook until the 90s stated that every law enforcement agency used, you don't hype it up, you don't give it coverage.
[00:50:35.699 --> 00:50:42.361]  Now, when you see an underwear bombing or you see a 9-11, when it's staged, they hype it.
[00:50:42.361 --> 00:50:48.264]  And the fact that they are hyping it will cause some copycats, whether it's staged or not, to go out and attack.
[00:50:49.505 --> 00:50:52.569]  And this guy realizes that.
[00:50:52.569 --> 00:51:00.559]  And the Democrats are hyping this, are pushing it, and it's going to probably cause some mentally ill people to get the idea in their head to go shoot a congressman.
[00:51:02.102 --> 00:51:03.744]  Is it safe to breathe anymore?
[00:51:03.744 --> 00:51:15.197]  Crowded public places, global pandemics, and news reports of potential new strains of bacteria and viruses make you wonder, what if there was a germ-killing nasal spray that acted almost like hand sanitizer for your nose?
[00:51:15.197 --> 00:51:16.158]  There is!
[00:51:16.158 --> 00:51:19.903]  It's called Sinophresh Homeopathic Nasal Spray, and it's a proven germ killer.
[00:51:20.223 --> 00:51:28.810]  Cynofresh is a revolutionary doctor-recommended nasal spray that kills a broad spectrum of viruses, bacteria, molds, and fungi on contact in your nose.
[00:51:28.810 --> 00:51:36.977]  Cynofresh causes no drug interactions, no loss of smell, no rebound congestion, contains no alcohol, is non-habit forming, and is safe for daily use.
[00:51:36.977 --> 00:51:39.439]  Cynofresh must be a part of your family survival plan.

[00:51:57.114 --> 00:51:58.255]  Use Sinofresh.
[00:51:58.255 --> 00:51:58.816]  It works.
[00:52:01.992 --> 00:52:06.020]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:09.267]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:09.267 --> 00:52:10.690]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:52:11.374 --> 00:52:14.056]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:14.056 --> 00:52:20.442]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.442 --> 00:52:25.986]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:25.986 --> 00:52:35.634]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:35.734 --> 00:52:38.076]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:38.076 --> 00:52:39.677]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:39.677 --> 00:52:42.139]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:42.139 --> 00:52:44.260]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:49.424]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:53:55.108 --> 00:53:56.069]  Make sure.
[00:53:56.069 --> 00:53:59.271]  Hands down.
[00:53:59.271 --> 00:54:03.554]  Wow!
[00:54:03.554 --> 00:54:08.137]  Anyone who has political understanding understands and knows
[00:54:09.301 --> 00:54:15.844]  That political crises will be staged by Obama now because they've committed political suicide.
[00:54:15.844 --> 00:54:22.746]  And the only way to raise themselves from the dead is to play the part of victims.
[00:54:22.746 --> 00:54:30.150]  And now, not just Michael Savage, but Rush Limbaugh is saying they're going to stage something and try to suspend the election.
[00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:33.571]  And for the first time, all the pieces are in place for this to happen.
[00:54:35.558 --> 00:54:43.720]  This is a revolution by a criminal financial oligarchy to take over our country.
[00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:51.462]  And there are no fewer than 10 that I have discovered, we played the clips here, of White House czars.
[00:54:51.462 --> 00:54:56.703]  The Diversity czar, the Regulations czar, the new head of the FCC,
[00:54:58.533 --> 00:55:10.180]  A whole bunch of members of Congress, but ten in the Obama administration, writing white papers, giving speeches, in between praising Chavez or Mao, they say we need to restrict free speech in America.
[00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:15.243]  Now, our free speech, anybody criticizing the government, it's now called hate.
[00:55:15.243 --> 00:55:21.687]  And it's in the news today, they're saying that Sarah Palin is being hateful, whether you love her or hate her.
[00:55:21.687 --> 00:55:23.889]  The point is, she's milquetoast.
[00:55:24.724 --> 00:55:32.591]  But if they can take her, and then blame her for what's happening, and try to demonize criticism of the government, they can go anywhere.
[00:55:32.591 --> 00:55:51.767]  Now here's Ed Schultz, yesterday, on his radio show, saying, shut up Rush Limbaugh, and shut up anyone criticizing the government, and implying that you're not allowed to have political views on a radio show, but he's allowed to have his views on radio and TV.
[00:55:53.305 --> 00:56:06.830]  Now whether you agree with Limbaugh or don't, the only monopoly we've had is the left-right control paradigm of the Republicans and the Democrats being the only people on dominant radio and not Constitutionalists, not Libertarians.
[00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:12.213]  I'm trying to change that.
[00:56:12.213 --> 00:56:15.214]  And pretty soon we're going to be up there close to a hundred stations.
[00:56:15.214 --> 00:56:22.937]  We got four stations last week, three the week before, two new stations this week, XM two weeks ago went to six nights a week,
[00:56:25.287 --> 00:56:32.291]  Re-broadcasting part of the broadcast, part of the show.
[00:56:32.291 --> 00:56:36.853]  Obama's openly announcing cyber security that he can shut the web down or censor whoever he wants.
[00:56:36.853 --> 00:56:42.016]  The New York Times, Time Magazine are proposing shutting down anyone that criticizes the government.
[00:56:42.016 --> 00:56:44.377]  I mean, they're saying this word for word.
[00:56:44.377 --> 00:56:46.058]  They mean business.
[00:56:47.156 --> 00:56:51.121]  And they will stage terror attacks as the pretext to do it.
[00:56:51.121 --> 00:56:56.128]  And they've been lining up the police and military and brainwashing them and prepping them for this.
[00:56:56.128 --> 00:56:57.650]  There's no doubt.
[00:56:57.650 --> 00:56:58.451]  They must do it.
[00:56:58.451 --> 00:57:02.076]  That's why Limbaugh has said they're going to stage something and try to suspend the election.
[00:57:02.076 --> 00:57:04.660]  There's nothing else they can do.
[00:57:07.608 --> 00:57:13.571]  And the Republican Party's going in trying to block real candidates like Rand Paul in Kentucky for the Senate.
[00:57:13.571 --> 00:57:14.952]  Let's play a clip of Ed Schultz.
[00:57:14.952 --> 00:57:15.913]  This is vicious.
[00:57:15.913 --> 00:57:19.795]  And he says, we've seized control of health care, now let's seize the media.
[00:57:19.795 --> 00:57:20.796]  They're going for broke.
[00:57:20.796 --> 00:57:22.557]  They're lawless crooks.
[00:57:22.557 --> 00:57:25.158]  And this guy is so un-American to call for this.
[00:57:25.158 --> 00:57:26.159]  Here it is.
[00:57:26.159 --> 00:57:29.401]  It is a cultural war that's taking place in America.
[00:57:29.401 --> 00:57:31.402]  You're exactly right.
[00:57:31.402 --> 00:57:34.584]  And it's being played out over the airwaves of America.
[00:57:34.584 --> 00:57:35.184]  And I hope
[00:57:35.794 --> 00:57:40.497]  The Democrats now turn to the Fairness Doctrine.
[00:57:40.497 --> 00:57:50.484]  It's time now for the Democrats to consider the Fairness Doctrine when you've got Rush Limbaugh out there saying, we've got to defeat these bastards.
[00:57:50.484 --> 00:58:01.071]  He is now openly admitting that he is going to work against and campaign against the Democratic Party and campaign against Obama.
[00:58:02.555 --> 00:58:07.558]  And he is motivating people with the microphone, and he's electioneering.
[00:58:07.558 --> 00:58:08.178]  Oh my gosh.
[00:58:08.178 --> 00:58:10.679]  Keep on talking, Ruski.
[00:58:10.679 --> 00:58:14.621]  Hell, maybe I'll get on 600 stations too, or how many you own, or whatever.
[00:58:14.621 --> 00:58:16.762]  Good pause.
[00:58:16.762 --> 00:58:19.784]  We're gonna come back in the next segment and play the rest of it.
[00:58:19.784 --> 00:58:21.005]  Did you hear that?
[00:58:21.005 --> 00:58:22.866]  Keep on talking, Ruski.
[00:58:22.866 --> 00:58:24.126]  Maybe I'll get on 600.
[00:58:24.126 --> 00:58:27.668]  Yeah, when he's taking off.
[00:58:27.668 --> 00:58:31.210]  I mean, Schultz is such a pile of...
[00:58:32.133 --> 00:58:33.974]  Crap.
[00:58:33.974 --> 00:58:37.155]  I mean, he is an enemy of this country.
[00:58:37.155 --> 00:58:38.296]  He is a tyrant.
[00:58:38.296 --> 00:58:42.938]  He is a thug.
[00:58:42.938 --> 00:58:45.439]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.439 --> 00:58:47.760]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:51.696 --> 00:58:55.720]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:58.944]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:58:58.944 --> 00:59:03.769]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:59:03.769 --> 00:59:10.155]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:59:10.155 --> 00:59:12.398]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:59:12.918 --> 00:59:13.218]  Tim Geithner?
[00:59:13.218 --> 00:59:13.719]  Bernanke?
[00:59:13.719 --> 00:59:14.519]  They're arsonists!
[00:59:14.519 --> 00:59:15.700]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:17.921]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:59:31.809 --> 00:59:33.670]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:39.093]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:59:39.093 --> 00:59:53.400]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:55.782]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.782 --> 00:59:58.023]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio.
[01:00:03.004 --> 01:00:07.827]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:07.827 --> 01:00:09.448]  You want answers?
[01:00:09.448 --> 01:00:10.969]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:10.969 --> 01:00:15.152]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:15.152 --> 01:00:24.678]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.678 --> 01:00:25.439]  Alright, so...
[01:00:26.601 --> 01:00:28.662]  Let's just play the clip from the beginning.
[01:00:28.662 --> 01:00:30.583]  We started at the end of the last hour.
[01:00:30.583 --> 01:00:39.467]  You've got all these congressmen, all these senators, at least ten of Obama's czars on record saying, restrict free speech in America.
[01:00:41.397 --> 01:00:47.541]  Take over the internet, shut down anybody that disagrees with man-made global warming, anthropogenic global warming.
[01:00:47.541 --> 01:00:54.806]  Now here's Shultz saying, keep talking Limbaugh, we're going to bring back the Fairness Doctrine and kick you off and put me on your stations.
[01:00:54.806 --> 01:00:56.387]  Oh, you hear that, private station owners?
[01:00:56.387 --> 01:01:02.551]  You've got to put this disgusting dirtball, Ed Shultz, on your station.
[01:01:02.551 --> 01:01:10.436]  Again, I'm an enemy of anybody that calls for banning free speech and free market, and I'm all for the free press.
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:13.682]  I own one.
[01:01:13.682 --> 01:01:15.705]  The free press is great if you own one.
[01:01:15.705 --> 01:01:17.867]  And that's the great thing about the internet.
[01:01:17.867 --> 01:01:20.950]  Now everybody can own their own printing press.
[01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:25.495]  And the system worldwide is coming in against the internet and free speech and talk radio.
[01:01:25.495 --> 01:01:31.381]  And the FCC's declared, under cybersecurity, they will regulate the internet.
[01:01:31.381 --> 01:01:32.643]  They mean business.
[01:01:34.209 --> 01:01:37.391]  This is so un-American, so threatening, so evil.
[01:01:37.391 --> 01:01:39.932]  They've already seized health care and he says that.
[01:01:39.932 --> 01:01:42.714]  Now let's just seize talk radio.
[01:01:42.714 --> 01:01:46.356]  I mean, we might as well be East Germany or Communist China.
[01:01:46.356 --> 01:01:52.060]  The magnitude of what these people are calling for to shut down their competition.
[01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:54.861]  That's the nature of big government.
[01:01:54.861 --> 01:01:59.044]  It's a bunch of control freaks who can't make it because nobody wants to listen to them.
[01:01:59.044 --> 01:02:01.025]  What, Schultz on TV got like 100,000 viewers or something?
[01:02:02.907 --> 01:02:05.128]  No one watches MSNBC.
[01:02:05.128 --> 01:02:05.989]  It's a joke.
[01:02:05.989 --> 01:02:13.153]  Their top-rated show has 400,000 viewers and Glenn Beck posing as a patriot has 4 million?
[01:02:13.153 --> 01:02:15.454]  My show has 2 million a day!
[01:02:15.454 --> 01:02:19.417]  You think this guy likes the fact that no one wants to listen to him?
[01:02:19.417 --> 01:02:30.103]  So he... It'd be like if somebody owned a better Mexican food restaurant or a better steakhouse than you and so you got voted in as the city council mayor and so you had the health department go shut them down.
[01:02:31.328 --> 01:02:35.170]  Because your restaurant's full of big fat cockroaches and rat turds.
[01:02:35.170 --> 01:02:39.633]  Let's go ahead and play this un-American enemy of America.
[01:02:39.633 --> 01:02:42.074]  Just a dangerous person, Pig Schultz.
[01:02:42.074 --> 01:02:44.055]  Here he is.
[01:02:44.055 --> 01:02:47.197]  It is a cultural war that's taking place in America.
[01:02:47.197 --> 01:02:49.198]  You're exactly right.
[01:02:49.198 --> 01:02:52.379]  And it's being played out over the airwaves of America.
[01:02:52.379 --> 01:02:57.042]  And I hope the Democrats now turn to the fairness doctrine.
[01:02:58.311 --> 01:03:08.299]  It's time now for the Democrats to consider the fairness doctrine when you've got Rush Limbaugh out there saying we've got to defeat these bastards.
[01:03:08.299 --> 01:03:18.887]  He is now openly admitting that he is going to work against and campaign against the Democratic Party and campaign against Obama.
[01:03:20.370 --> 01:03:23.552]  And he is motivating people with the microphone.
[01:03:23.552 --> 01:03:25.013]  Hit pause.
[01:03:25.013 --> 01:03:31.877]  Nobody has a problem with Bloomberg spending a billion bucks in his last three campaigns and owning a media empire.
[01:03:31.877 --> 01:03:34.038]  Limbaugh can run for president if he wants to.
[01:03:34.038 --> 01:03:35.439]  I mean, this is a free country, Schultz!
[01:03:35.439 --> 01:03:36.540]  Get out of here!
[01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:39.081]  Play the rest of him.
[01:03:39.081 --> 01:03:40.482]  Keep on talking, Ruski.
[01:03:41.593 --> 01:03:46.102]  Hell, maybe I'll get on 600 stations too, or how many you own, or whatever.
[01:03:46.102 --> 01:03:52.634]  The fact is, look, it's not a level playing field when it comes to the audio culture of the country.
[01:03:52.634 --> 01:03:54.076]  Ownership has its privileges.
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:57.842]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:03:57.842 --> 01:04:01.105]  You have the Defense Department funding you over at MSNBC.
[01:04:01.105 --> 01:04:03.667]  You're a fake liberal.
[01:04:03.667 --> 01:04:05.928]  You have your hand in our back pocket every day.
[01:04:05.928 --> 01:04:08.230]  You're a big fat parasite.
[01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:19.839]  And then you're mad because finally the right-wing radio, because enough people in the establishment are upset, is finally coming out and telling the truth because the ultra-rich are now robbing the wealthy.
[01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:23.601]  And the middle class?
[01:04:23.601 --> 01:04:24.441]  Finish up with Shultz.
[01:04:24.441 --> 01:04:25.641]  Let's go out to break with him.
[01:04:25.641 --> 01:04:32.223]  I will be honest, if I owned 500 stations, the drugstore wouldn't be on any of them.
[01:04:32.223 --> 01:04:34.204]  And that's just where it's at right now.
[01:04:34.204 --> 01:04:39.826]  But maybe we have reached the point where the Congress needs to equal it out.
[01:04:39.826 --> 01:04:42.786]  Equal out the audience.
[01:04:42.786 --> 01:04:50.049]  And that means equal it out- Just keep in mind, there aren't any poor people with microphones.
[01:04:50.049 --> 01:04:50.809]  Alright, oh really?
[01:04:52.409 --> 01:04:57.226]  Oh, he's protecting the poor people cutting their Medicare and Medicaid.
[01:04:57.226 --> 01:04:58.109]  You're a sicko.
[01:05:00.253 --> 01:05:04.215]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:04.215 --> 01:05:13.078]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:05:13.078 --> 01:05:17.700]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:28.525]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:05:29.144 --> 01:05:38.653]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:38.653 --> 01:05:44.098]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:05:44.098 --> 01:05:51.585]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:51.585 --> 01:05:54.348]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:05:58.206 --> 01:05:59.507]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:59.507 --> 01:06:05.092]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:06:05.092 --> 01:06:10.116]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:06:10.116 --> 01:06:15.141]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:06:15.681 --> 01:06:20.905]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:06:20.905 --> 01:06:28.011]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:06:28.011 --> 01:06:29.132]  And here's the best part.
[01:06:29.132 --> 01:06:35.497]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:06:35.817 --> 01:06:38.998]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:06:38.998 --> 01:06:41.219]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:06:41.219 --> 01:06:42.159]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:06:42.159 --> 01:06:42.359]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:06:42.359 --> 01:06:45.800]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:47.540]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:06:59.150 --> 01:07:04.792]  George Washington said, Government is not reason, it is not eloquence, it is force, like fire.
[01:07:04.792 --> 01:07:07.352]  It is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.
[01:07:07.352 --> 01:07:13.194]  America's government is no longer the servant of the people and the protector of our liberty, but has become that fearful master.
[01:07:13.194 --> 01:07:19.116]  We the people must understand the nature of this government gone awry if we are to be successful in saving our country.
[01:07:19.116 --> 01:07:25.918]  America is being deliberately destroyed by a cabal of international gangsters so that she can be forced into subjugation to a one world government.
[01:07:26.198 --> 01:07:26.679]  We're good to go.
[01:07:59.244 --> 01:08:08.371]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:08:08.371 --> 01:08:09.092]  to 3 p.m.
[01:08:09.092 --> 01:08:09.472]  Central.
[01:08:09.472 --> 01:08:11.834]  We're here live back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:08:11.834 --> 01:08:13.495]  All Times Central.
[01:08:13.495 --> 01:08:17.618]  Websites are InfoWars.com and PresidentOfThePlanet.com.
[01:08:17.618 --> 01:08:22.382]  We're going to open the phones up on any issue or news story or item you wish to cover.
[01:08:24.633 --> 01:08:26.375]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:08:26.375 --> 01:08:33.423]  Please have your points ready though, because I'm gonna move quickly through your calls when we start going to them.
[01:08:33.423 --> 01:08:33.863]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:08:33.863 --> 01:08:35.024]  Now, I just wanted to go back.
[01:08:35.024 --> 01:08:38.828]  We just did five minutes of search engine probing.
[01:08:48.072 --> 01:09:03.642]  And out of the memory hole, got five different articles from the last two years of Democrats and Republicans staging attacks on themselves.
[01:09:03.642 --> 01:09:13.028]  I would have to say eight times out of ten, and you always find out about it later once it's not big headlines, so the perception is still there.
[01:09:13.028 --> 01:09:15.690]  People don't pay attention to the fine print, they read the headlines.
[01:09:17.318 --> 01:09:26.587]  But eight times out of ten on average, when somebody knocks over trash cans or sets fire to trash cans or throws rocks at cops, it's cops.
[01:09:26.587 --> 01:09:31.292]  They've been caught in Canada, they've been caught in Colorado, they've been caught in California, they've been caught in Italy.
[01:09:31.292 --> 01:09:33.574]  They're constantly being caught and it comes out in the news.
[01:09:37.463 --> 01:09:45.049]  I'd have to say almost 100% of the time on college campuses, I've seen very few cases where it turns out it was real.
[01:09:45.049 --> 01:09:52.015]  The guys have admitted it with the cotton balls by the black dormitory, I guess saying your slaves are picking cotton.
[01:09:52.015 --> 01:09:53.836]  That, it looks like, was real.
[01:09:53.836 --> 01:09:55.398]  That happened a few weeks ago.
[01:09:55.398 --> 01:10:00.362]  But every other case of swastikas on black dorms or Jewish dorms, it's all been staged.
[01:10:00.362 --> 01:10:01.683]  I see one of those every month or so.
[01:10:03.985 --> 01:10:08.889]  And so statistically, just historically, most of this is probably staged.
[01:10:08.889 --> 01:10:20.118]  Which shows you how false flag terrorism, not just at the local level, or the micro level, but at the larger international level, is the name of the game as well.
[01:10:20.118 --> 01:10:23.881]  And when they don't purely stage it, they provocateur.
[01:10:24.935 --> 01:10:52.715]  mental midgets to do it and that's come out again this week but here's the Denver Post 08 race Denver Post headline 08 race worker held in damage to Colorado HQ and they reportedly went and bashed out the windows and pictures of Barack Obama during the campaign to get him some more support one of two people suspected we went looked it up they were later arrested
[01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:55.410]  Here's another one.
[01:10:55.410 --> 01:10:56.231]  GWU student fakes hate.
[01:11:19.025 --> 01:11:21.566]  Admitted drawing swastikas on her own door.
[01:11:21.566 --> 01:11:23.707]  The schools have learned how to catch them.
[01:11:23.707 --> 01:11:27.109]  They just set up a hidden camera and it's always the students.
[01:11:27.109 --> 01:11:30.010]  So they can get a bunch of attention.
[01:11:30.010 --> 01:11:34.392]  And I got several other articles of fake swastikas and people setting fires to their own churches.
[01:11:34.392 --> 01:11:40.335]  Now to be fair, remember back in 08, a woman in Pittsburgh
[01:11:41.894 --> 01:11:43.395]  And she later admitted it.
[01:11:43.395 --> 01:11:47.058]  Woman with B scratched in face, faked political attack.
[01:11:47.058 --> 01:11:54.004]  She said black guy, she's a 20 year old white woman at the time, now 22, scratched a B on her face, but it was backwards.
[01:11:54.004 --> 01:11:57.848]  And the cops noticed that she'd done it to herself in a mirror because the B was backwards.
[01:11:57.848 --> 01:11:59.369]  What an idiot!
[01:11:59.369 --> 01:12:02.812]  And the whole thing was staged and fake.
[01:12:02.812 --> 01:12:06.215]  And so they arrested her.
[01:12:06.215 --> 01:12:07.256]  So that's my point.
[01:12:07.256 --> 01:12:09.698]  I mean, we don't just get up here and say most of this is staged.
[01:12:11.755 --> 01:12:13.076]  80% of the time or higher.
[01:12:13.076 --> 01:12:15.917]  Well, with the cops, it's 90% of the time.
[01:12:15.917 --> 01:12:20.018]  And that's just the 10% of the time or less that we can't ever find out what really happened.
[01:12:20.018 --> 01:12:23.979]  You know, the cases are still open.
[01:12:23.979 --> 01:12:34.843]  The cops stage attacks, the Democrats stage attacks, Republican idiots stage attacks.
[01:12:34.843 --> 01:12:36.384]  This is human nature.
[01:12:36.384 --> 01:12:37.644]  It's called a frame-up.
[01:12:39.727 --> 01:12:41.808]  Now, I'm going to say it again.
[01:12:41.808 --> 01:12:43.368]  It is paramount.
[01:12:43.368 --> 01:12:47.249]  It is of peak importance.
[01:12:47.249 --> 01:12:53.651]  It is of the first importance that we get the truth out about this.
[01:12:53.651 --> 01:12:55.631]  This isn't just socialism.
[01:12:55.631 --> 01:12:59.913]  This is a massive cut of Medicare and Medicaid and medical standards.
[01:12:59.913 --> 01:13:03.053]  Many members of Congress and the executive are exempt.
[01:13:03.053 --> 01:13:08.355]  It does not cover pre-existing conditions the way I read the bill for adults as well, but AP says for children.
[01:13:09.761 --> 01:13:15.025]  It has a national ID card in it, but it has the IRS taking control of our lives.
[01:13:15.025 --> 01:13:20.309]  It taxes medical savings accounts of anybody who gets treatments the government doesn't agree with.
[01:13:20.309 --> 01:13:24.612]  The IRS gets to share your medical records, but I digress.
[01:13:24.612 --> 01:13:28.936]  The paramount issue here is we've got to get the truth out.
[01:13:28.936 --> 01:13:33.379]  The right-wing controlled Republican Party isn't going to do it.
[01:13:33.379 --> 01:13:38.383]  The controlled Democratic Party, controlled by the very same special interests, they're not going to do it.
[01:13:40.950 --> 01:13:52.700]  They are all conspiring together, the Republicans to play it off against the Democrats, the Democrats are going to try to sell it as something free for the poor, and something loving and benevolent they're doing.
[01:13:52.700 --> 01:14:05.471]  When in reality, this is nothing but the bank-owned insurance companies, the top insurance companies, consolidating their competition, that's in Businessweek, writing the bill, making you buy their overpriced, cruddy healthcare.
[01:14:07.073 --> 01:14:07.494]  Think about it.
[01:14:07.494 --> 01:14:08.875]  Land of the free, home of the brave.
[01:14:08.875 --> 01:14:16.064]  The government says what type of health care you can have and tells you you've got to have it.
[01:14:16.064 --> 01:14:19.128]  And so here is nasdaq.com.
[01:14:19.128 --> 01:14:25.536]  Health care stocks up after passage of bill led by health insurance
[01:14:27.317 --> 01:14:34.341]  That's what's leading, not just our stocks, but in Europe, because it's all owned by the same big banks.
[01:14:34.341 --> 01:14:38.903]  They're all exploding, driving the stock market up this week.
[01:14:38.903 --> 01:14:42.885]  The major indexes of other stocks are down, but not healthcare.
[01:14:42.885 --> 01:14:52.029]  Oh, because the healthcare industry has really been dealt a big blow, and they're in so much trouble, and it's just horrible.
[01:14:52.029 --> 01:14:53.590]  And Limbaugh is up there every day.
[01:14:54.753 --> 01:14:57.836]  Saying, oh, the poor insurance companies, they don't make that much money.
[01:14:57.836 --> 01:14:59.017]  They're allowed to make money.
[01:14:59.017 --> 01:15:00.839]  This is free market.
[01:15:00.839 --> 01:15:07.265]  No, the insurance companies in the last 40 years have gone in with the government and gotten people on the so-called welfare bandwagon.
[01:15:07.265 --> 01:15:11.969]  And with all the red tape and bureaucracy, it's ruined health care and increased all the cost.
[01:15:11.969 --> 01:15:15.232]  And now it's only going to get worse and the insurance company profits are going to go up.
[01:15:18.732 --> 01:15:21.855]  Just like the banker bailout wasn't a banker bailout, it was a banker takeover.
[01:15:21.855 --> 01:15:32.706]  And now they've got legislation for the Federal Reserve to be able to take over any financial institution, and that means dental offices, hot dog stands, you heard Napolitano yesterday, that's in the bill.
[01:15:32.706 --> 01:15:38.352]  To allow a select coterie of private central bankers to take over any of their competition they want.
[01:15:39.738 --> 01:15:45.639]  You thought Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns being fed to Goldman Sachs was bad in 2008?
[01:15:45.639 --> 01:15:47.320]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:51.341]  This is banks with government power worldwide.
[01:15:51.341 --> 01:16:07.165]  They already run our nations to the point that they've got Von Rumpy and Gordon Brown and Ban Ki-moon and Al Gore all over TV saying, in the next year we're going to sign a global constitution between the G20 and four other private central banks all interlocked
[01:16:07.665 --> 01:16:12.647]  They already run our countries, they're setting up a global government amongst themselves.
[01:16:12.647 --> 01:16:20.089]  And you got Ed Schultz going, we're gonna give poor people some free healthcare.
[01:16:20.089 --> 01:16:26.531]  This is a guy funded by General Electric.
[01:16:26.531 --> 01:16:30.992]  The Republicans don't have a problem with a trillion and a half dollar a year defense budget.
[01:16:34.565 --> 01:16:41.067]  It's a trillion, 100 billion on budget, and they have the after budget, it's actually over 500, so it's like 600 billion, 700 billion.
[01:16:41.067 --> 01:16:43.148]  So 1 trillion, 700 billion.
[01:16:43.148 --> 01:17:03.954]  You never hear about that, you never hear about the no-bid contracts, you never hear about all the other Constitution trampling activities, the Patriot Act, secret arrest, torture, Lindsey Graham, a veritable ogre of corruption, wanting the healthcare bill, wanting the carbon taxes, wanting amnesty, worker ID card for citizens that illegals are exempt from,
[01:17:05.086 --> 01:17:14.463]  Now wanting a bill where citizens can be secretly arrested as belligerents for any intelligence purpose and given quote enhanced interrogation.
[01:17:15.666 --> 01:17:17.267]  All you ever hear about is waterboarding, waterboarding.
[01:17:17.267 --> 01:17:18.127]  Oh, that's bad.
[01:17:18.127 --> 01:17:20.729]  What about raping people's children in front of their parents?
[01:17:20.729 --> 01:17:22.950]  What about raping people with battery acid?
[01:17:22.950 --> 01:17:24.911]  What about killing people?
[01:17:24.911 --> 01:17:27.772]  What about hanging them up by their arms for weeks on end?
[01:17:27.772 --> 01:17:30.774]  That's all admitted to be going on, and now that's going to be done to U.S.
[01:17:30.774 --> 01:17:43.240]  citizens, out in the open, right on time with the MIAC and Homeland Security reports and ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center reports that, oh my gosh, there's all these domestic terrorists, all these pro-lifers, all these gun people.
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:44.401]  We gotta go after them.
[01:17:45.762 --> 01:17:47.423]  We gotta arrest them as belligerents.
[01:17:47.423 --> 01:17:59.853]  We gotta put them, and the federal government's built three new super maxes just for domestic extremists, where you don't even get to see your family, and you're held in solitary confinement, and could be given pain compliance torture.
[01:17:59.853 --> 01:18:07.259]  Oh yeah, there's no FEMA camps.
[01:18:07.259 --> 01:18:09.821]  Healthcare stocks up after House O.K.'
[01:18:09.801 --> 01:18:10.442]  's overhaul.
[01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:14.982]  Market Watch, Wall Street Journal, U.S.
[01:18:14.982 --> 01:18:23.531]  stocks mostly up as health care stocks rise, led by health insurance stocks.
[01:18:23.531 --> 01:18:24.952]  That's why I don't like Dennis Kucinich.
[01:18:24.952 --> 01:18:26.994]  That's why I can't stand him.
[01:18:26.994 --> 01:18:32.980]  Because he would tell the truth and say this is a rip-off and cuts Medicare and Medicaid and doesn't give people guaranteed care.
[01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:36.123]  If you're going to be for socialism, it might as well be what you're saying it is.
[01:18:37.093 --> 01:18:43.134]  But see, I'm against socialism, because it sounds nice, it never works, because powerful interests always steal the money!
[01:18:43.134 --> 01:18:51.155]  100, 100% of the time.
[01:18:51.155 --> 01:18:59.317]  Not 99%, not 98, not 97, 100% of the time.
[01:18:59.317 --> 01:19:05.918]  And you got a bunch of ignorant Americans who don't know what happens in Europe or in England, and don't know about the rationing of care, and don't know about them,
[01:19:06.963 --> 01:19:09.906]  Tying old people down, begging for water and food and killing them.
[01:19:09.906 --> 01:19:11.108]  That's on record!
[01:19:11.108 --> 01:19:12.870]  You can't make this stuff up!
[01:19:12.870 --> 01:19:17.375]  And I know a lot of people have a blind spot because this is so evil, you can't even imagine this is going on.
[01:19:17.375 --> 01:19:18.336]  It is happening.
[01:19:18.336 --> 01:19:19.397]  And we've documented it here.
[01:19:25.987 --> 01:19:36.838]  Meanwhile, I was talking yesterday about victim disarmament in Europe, and how if you physically fight back against a rapist in your own home, you get arrested, and then they sue you, and when?
[01:19:36.838 --> 01:19:42.343]  Or if you stab somebody raping your wife, you go to prison, they throw the book at you?
[01:19:42.343 --> 01:19:44.825]  Here it is, out of the United States.
[01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:57.191]  We'll be right back and your phone calls are coming up.
[01:19:57.191 --> 01:19:58.972]  I haven't even scratched the surface on the news.
[01:19:58.972 --> 01:20:02.533]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:20:02.533 --> 01:20:04.814]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:20:04.814 --> 01:20:05.695]  Don't!
[01:20:05.695 --> 01:20:09.116]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[01:20:09.116 --> 01:20:16.239]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[01:20:16.219 --> 01:20:18.220]  's number one debt secret.

[01:22:59.897 --> 01:23:01.939]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[01:23:01.939 --> 01:23:04.482]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[01:23:04.482 --> 01:23:06.564]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[01:23:06.564 --> 01:23:08.186]  Your answer may be at hand.
[01:23:08.186 --> 01:23:11.770]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[01:23:11.770 --> 01:23:17.016]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[01:23:17.016 --> 01:23:20.320]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[01:23:20.799 --> 01:23:22.500]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:25.341]  Wild food grows everywhere, and you will see it everywhere.
[01:23:25.341 --> 01:23:28.662]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[01:23:28.662 --> 01:23:37.106]  Well-respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.

[01:24:03.774 --> 01:24:05.535]  It had to be eight, nine years ago.
[01:24:05.535 --> 01:24:07.716]  It was in Virginia.
[01:24:07.716 --> 01:24:08.896]  He was over 90 years old.
[01:24:08.896 --> 01:24:09.576]  We interviewed him.
[01:24:09.576 --> 01:24:11.197]  I doubt he's still alive.
[01:24:11.197 --> 01:24:11.777]  He'd be over 100.
[01:24:11.777 --> 01:24:15.419]  We could pull up the case.
[01:24:15.419 --> 01:24:25.343]  But two ex-cons broke into his house and started robbing him and started beating him.
[01:24:25.343 --> 01:24:27.584]  So he got to a gun and shot both of them.
[01:24:29.235 --> 01:24:33.759]  If memory serves, neither one died and the police arrested him.
[01:24:33.759 --> 01:24:36.000]  They want to make us just like England.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:42.646]  Now the police have no liability to protect us, but then they want our guns.
[01:24:42.646 --> 01:24:45.408]  This is out of WDBO television.
[01:24:48.462 --> 01:24:54.145]  And it says an unidentified woman could face charges for biting a man who broke into her room to have sex with her.
[01:24:54.145 --> 01:25:06.771]  The woman told Orlando Police she was asleep in her locked bedroom when 44-year-old Steven Brown came in and tried to have sex with her.
[01:25:06.771 --> 01:25:12.834]  According to the police report, the woman did not want to have sex with Brown and told him to leave.
[01:25:12.834 --> 01:25:15.415]  They arrested Brown and charged him with sexual battery.
[01:25:15.415 --> 01:25:16.476]  So, show
[01:25:17.515 --> 01:25:27.939]  He came in and got on top of her, she started hitting him and bitting, and they're taking him to jail and her to jail.
[01:25:27.939 --> 01:25:35.181]  I'm telling you folks, this is a lawless criminal government we've got, where they hate the citizens.
[01:25:35.181 --> 01:25:40.443]  And I'm not saying all the police are like this, but their commanders almost unanimously are.
[01:25:40.443 --> 01:25:43.144]  They're hiring a bunch of shiftless scum.
[01:25:48.387 --> 01:25:53.069]  Now let me go over some of the economic news and I'm coming back and going into your calls.
[01:25:53.069 --> 01:25:56.871]  Personal income drops across the country.
[01:25:56.871 --> 01:26:00.013]  Personal income in 42 states fell in 2009.
[01:26:00.013 --> 01:26:02.074]  The Commerce Department said Thursday.
[01:26:02.074 --> 01:26:09.718]  And it says manufacturing, home building, and tourism being way down led the decline.
[01:26:12.810 --> 01:26:17.974]  Here's a New York Times article, Social Security to see payout exceed pay-in this year.
[01:26:17.974 --> 01:26:23.018]  But don't worry, the government's launching a bunch of new taxes and expanding every federal program.
[01:26:23.018 --> 01:26:24.999]  And Bush tripled the size of government.
[01:26:24.999 --> 01:26:37.248]  Obama, in less than a year in office, he's now been in over a year, spent more than all presidents before him combined.
[01:26:37.248 --> 01:26:40.370]  George Bush, back to George Washington.
[01:26:40.370 --> 01:26:42.192]  And those are official numbers, that is not denied.
[01:26:44.326 --> 01:26:56.230]  And as we get deeper into debt, just like Greece, the IMF will come in, we'll lose our AAA rating, and they'll say, America's imploding!
[01:26:56.230 --> 01:26:58.071]  Banks, loan us money!
[01:26:58.071 --> 01:27:01.552]  And the IMF and World Bank will loan us our tax money back.
[01:27:01.552 --> 01:27:03.533]  That's what the bailout was.
[01:27:03.533 --> 01:27:04.513]  28 trillion in the U.S.
[01:27:04.513 --> 01:27:06.694]  and growing.
[01:27:06.694 --> 01:27:06.934]  Another 20.
[01:27:09.175 --> 01:27:17.460]  Did I say 28 billion, excuse me, 28 trillion in the U.S., another 20 trillion globally.
[01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:27.966]  So we're talking, we're talking about right up at 50 trillion stolen the last year and a half, and the banks won't say where it went.
[01:27:27.966 --> 01:27:36.071]  And then they go into all these different, now Western nations, they're done fully bankrupting the third world and taking total control, and they come in
[01:27:38.283 --> 01:27:49.489]  And tell us that we're bankrupt so they've got to raise all of our taxes and then we go completely bankrupt, they will come back and loan us our own money back.
[01:27:49.489 --> 01:27:50.849]  Talk about a fraud.
[01:27:50.849 --> 01:27:54.891]  Talk about a scam.
[01:27:54.891 --> 01:27:55.852]  But they get away with it.
[01:27:55.852 --> 01:28:07.358]  And then I saw today a Financial Times of London article that was actually extremely honest about
[01:28:08.462 --> 01:28:11.923]  The situation in Greece.
[01:28:11.923 --> 01:28:20.186]  I was on Russia Today yesterday before the announcement was made that the IMF will, quote, bail out Greece.
[01:28:20.186 --> 01:28:25.228]  The IMF already set up the policies ten years ago, privately run by Goldman Sachs.
[01:28:25.228 --> 01:28:30.010]  Now, Goldman Sachs executive openly runs the economy as their finance minister.
[01:28:31.343 --> 01:28:42.171]  And they're calling it a bailout to come in and give them more loans at loan sharking rates as the entire infrastructure is handed over to the private banks.
[01:28:42.171 --> 01:28:43.952]  It's not a rescue.
[01:28:43.952 --> 01:28:47.255]  It's like a loan shark giving you another loan.
[01:28:47.255 --> 01:28:48.015]  And here it is.
[01:28:48.015 --> 01:28:50.657]  IMF struggles to conceal glee.
[01:28:50.657 --> 01:28:52.419]  Financial Times.
[01:28:52.419 --> 01:29:00.585]  Though International Monetary Fund officials try to conceal their excitement at the thought of another country sliding towards financial disaster, there is no doubt
[01:29:02.247 --> 01:29:07.109]  That leading a rescue effort for Greece will be an enormous prize.
[01:29:07.109 --> 01:29:18.255]  Decried a couple of years ago as too small to be useful, the IMF has expanded its lending capability rapidly thanks to a string of higher contributions from member governments, i.e.
[01:29:18.255 --> 01:29:19.335]  the United States.
[01:29:19.335 --> 01:29:20.816]  Your tax money.
[01:29:20.816 --> 01:29:24.558]  And led a series of rescues in troubled East European countries.
[01:29:24.558 --> 01:29:27.019]  Oh yeah, they're rescuing them.
[01:29:27.019 --> 01:29:30.701]  Jim Jones was rescuing his followers, giving them cyanide-laced Kool-Aid.
[01:29:32.591 --> 01:29:36.454]  And then the article goes into how they're predators.
[01:29:36.454 --> 01:29:39.797]  We're going to come back and do a bunch of other really important news.
[01:29:39.797 --> 01:29:42.979]  Tell you about the global greenhouse gas taxes.
[01:29:42.979 --> 01:29:45.902]  In trouble in Europe and France, but not here.
[01:29:45.902 --> 01:29:48.944]  Stay with us.
[01:29:48.944 --> 01:29:50.325]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.325 --> 01:29:52.847]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.847 --> 01:29:55.550]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.902 --> 01:30:01.924]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:01.924 --> 01:30:07.249]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:07.249 --> 01:30:09.290]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:09.290 --> 01:30:14.294]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:14.294 --> 01:30:15.475]  How much do you want?
[01:30:15.475 --> 01:30:16.596]  When do you want it?
[01:30:16.596 --> 01:30:18.497]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:18.497 --> 01:30:19.558]  When will you need it?
[01:30:19.558 --> 01:30:21.760]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:23.121]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:23.121 --> 01:30:24.422]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:24.622 --> 01:30:29.884]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:29.884 --> 01:30:33.465]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:33.465 --> 01:30:37.286]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:37.286 --> 01:30:38.506]  How much will you need?
[01:30:38.506 --> 01:30:39.406]  We don't know.
[01:30:39.406 --> 01:30:40.527]  How much do you want?
[01:30:40.527 --> 01:30:41.447]  All you can get.
[01:30:41.447 --> 01:30:42.127]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:42.628 --> 01:30:43.269]  We're good to go!
[01:30:58.124 --> 01:31:03.451]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:31:03.451 --> 01:31:06.195]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:31:06.195 --> 01:31:10.661]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:31:12.944 --> 01:31:16.007]  Order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.

[01:33:07.874 --> 01:33:08.976]  We are back live.
[01:33:08.976 --> 01:33:12.080]  Thank you for joining us on this Friday edition.
[01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:17.306]  Bob Chapman coming up to give us his take on the government takeover of healthcare.
[01:33:17.306 --> 01:33:26.338]  The private banks worldwide are running around jacking up environment taxes, healthcare taxes, transportation taxes.
[01:33:28.368 --> 01:33:30.910]  Retirement fund taxes.
[01:33:30.910 --> 01:33:40.136]  Bloomberg reported a week ago the federal government is instructing government pension funds to invest in quote bad debt.
[01:33:40.136 --> 01:33:42.878]  In fact, print me that Bloomberg again.
[01:33:42.878 --> 01:33:46.520]  Pensions to be invested in government debt.
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:47.061]  Print me that again.
[01:33:47.061 --> 01:33:52.544]  I actually want to read from that when Bob Chapman's on with us because people email me and say they don't believe it.
[01:33:52.544 --> 01:33:56.427]  I want you to actually hear this directly from the newspaper as I read it.
[01:34:00.854 --> 01:34:13.165]  By the way, a week into this bill, not even a week into this bill being law, I've got multiple mainstream reports here where health care companies are announcing massive increases in everybody's insurance.
[01:34:13.165 --> 01:34:13.785]  Well of course!
[01:34:13.785 --> 01:34:18.469]  They've been given a green light to rape you!
[01:34:18.469 --> 01:34:25.355]  Because all they are is a private collection agency for the banks and lowering your standard of care.
[01:34:25.355 --> 01:34:27.157]  But instead the Republicans make this about
[01:34:28.326 --> 01:34:31.507]  Is it morally right to make people get health insurance?
[01:34:31.507 --> 01:34:35.289]  Is it morally right to tax the middle class and give it to the poor?
[01:34:35.289 --> 01:34:37.310]  That's not even what's happening here.
[01:34:37.310 --> 01:34:43.372]  Everybody's being robbed but the tiny elite.
[01:34:43.372 --> 01:34:47.494]  I'm going to get into this stack of news here in just a moment.
[01:34:47.494 --> 01:34:52.016]  But before I do that, I want to put a plug in here.
[01:34:52.016 --> 01:34:56.418]  You know, I'm pretty good at making informative, very watchable,
[01:34:57.757 --> 01:35:00.939]  Educational documentary films.
[01:35:00.939 --> 01:35:06.643]  They're among the most popular alternative documentary films in the world, hands down.
[01:35:06.643 --> 01:35:09.485]  And many newspapers have made that point for me.
[01:35:09.485 --> 01:35:12.767]  I'm not tooting my horn.
[01:35:12.767 --> 01:35:21.833]  Conservatively, over 100, 150 million people have watched my documentary films online for free.
[01:35:21.833 --> 01:35:27.357]  But it is you, the radio listeners, that make all of that possible.
[01:35:34.170 --> 01:35:45.633]  It is you, the radio listeners, that fund the radio show, that fund the news websites, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:35:45.633 --> 01:35:57.397]  It is you, the radio listeners, that buy the original DVDs that are literally the seed money or the funding mechanism for all of this.
[01:35:57.397 --> 01:36:01.398]  We really have turned the establishment model on its head.
[01:36:02.748 --> 01:36:04.729]  I never intended to do it.
[01:36:04.729 --> 01:36:12.415]  I made my first documentary in 1997, 13 years ago, America Destroyed by Design.
[01:36:12.415 --> 01:36:20.340]  And I immediately went on the radio and said, please buy this VHS tape and please make copies of it.
[01:36:20.340 --> 01:36:27.545]  I had to borrow $4,000 from my father and I had never really borrowed money from him before.
[01:36:30.509 --> 01:36:52.367]  To take off from my radio show for two weeks in 1997 and drive around the country to show the UN plaques, to show the executive order, and then we would peaceably, nicely, dress nice, it's all on video, ask the park rangers to discuss the UN plaques, and they would flip out and threaten to arrest us.
[01:36:52.367 --> 01:36:53.348]  That's just part of the film.
[01:36:57.378 --> 01:36:59.460]  I was living in a one-room apartment.
[01:36:59.460 --> 01:37:01.961]  One room with a tiny kitchen and a bathroom.
[01:37:01.961 --> 01:37:03.863]  Some of the happiest years of my life, by the way.
[01:37:03.863 --> 01:37:08.686]  Not having to worry about a bunch of junk.
[01:37:08.686 --> 01:37:14.090]  And I had no intention of building this small media empire.
[01:37:14.090 --> 01:37:22.376]  I had no intention of being the leader of the resistance against the New World Order on talk radio.
[01:37:22.376 --> 01:37:24.057]  I had no intention on being
[01:37:25.327 --> 01:37:31.051]  The king of alternative documentary films.
[01:37:31.051 --> 01:37:35.654]  No intention of having the ADL call me the conspiracy king.
[01:37:35.654 --> 01:37:40.598]  Or the news call me the founder of the 9-11 truth movement.
[01:37:40.598 --> 01:37:47.263]  And that's another testament to what you can do by taking action and getting involved.
[01:37:47.263 --> 01:37:51.686]  You may not be as successful as I've been, but you will certainly reach thousands if you take action.
[01:37:54.249 --> 01:37:59.010]  But from day one, I told people to get my films, make copies, put them on AXS TV.
[01:37:59.010 --> 01:38:18.073]  I just wanted to reach people and warn people about how Oklahoma City was an inside job, how the government was staging terror attacks to demonize patriots, how the UN was taking over our national resources, and how our country was beginning to go into receivership to the IMF and World Bank.
[01:38:18.073 --> 01:38:21.154]  Now, fast forward 13 years later, I've made more than 20 films,
[01:38:22.875 --> 01:38:25.976]  We've got two new films coming out in the month of April.
[01:38:25.976 --> 01:38:34.359]  Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, and Invisible Empire, a New World Order Defined.
[01:38:34.359 --> 01:38:37.060]  And both of these documentaries are available.
[01:38:37.060 --> 01:38:39.901]  You can pre-order them now so you get them first.
[01:38:39.901 --> 01:38:44.203]  We ship it out in the order that they were received.
[01:38:44.203 --> 01:38:47.664]  And your purchase funds what we're doing.
[01:38:47.664 --> 01:38:49.105]  And if you can't afford the films,
[01:38:51.311 --> 01:38:55.712]  Within hours of them being released, they're going to be on YouTube and Google, and we will link to them.
[01:38:55.712 --> 01:39:01.793]  I have all these business people and other talk show hosts and filmmakers saying, why do you allow that?
[01:39:01.793 --> 01:39:03.993]  Doesn't it cut in on how many DVDs you sell?
[01:39:03.993 --> 01:39:04.973]  Absolutely.
[01:39:04.973 --> 01:39:08.534]  We'd sell 10 times more DVDs.
[01:39:08.534 --> 01:39:17.556]  I know other lesser filmmakers who make a lot more money than I do because they don't allow anybody to make copies, and they don't allow their stuff on the web.
[01:39:17.556 --> 01:39:18.816]  But we're not here to make money.
[01:39:21.877 --> 01:39:23.139]  I like to be comfortable.
[01:39:23.139 --> 01:39:24.020]  I like to be secure.
[01:39:24.020 --> 01:39:25.842]  I like to be able to defend myself.
[01:39:25.842 --> 01:39:27.564]  And having some treasure does that.
[01:39:27.564 --> 01:39:28.625]  But it's just that.
[01:39:28.625 --> 01:39:31.508]  Fuel.
[01:39:31.508 --> 01:39:34.071]  It's a tool.
[01:39:34.071 --> 01:39:36.795]  And I'd like to make more money so I could pay my staff more.
[01:39:36.795 --> 01:39:41.160]  But they're paid more than most people on radio.
[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:42.121]  In the positions they're in.
[01:39:45.117 --> 01:40:07.793]  But in the final equation, ladies and gentlemen, it is you, the PrisonPlanet.TV members, it is you, the purchasers of the DVDs, the books, the films, the t-shirts, the ball caps, that do fund our operation, and we're just able to maintain our position and expand because of your support.
[01:40:07.793 --> 01:40:10.155]  So I want to thank PrisonPlanet.TV members.
[01:40:12.150 --> 01:40:15.652]  You fund the CDNs, the servers for all the websites.
[01:40:15.652 --> 01:40:18.855]  You fund the two IT people I have that work here.
[01:40:18.855 --> 01:40:25.459]  It's a big nut to crack, but we have enough members to where you pay for that and see it as a donation, and I thank you.
[01:40:25.459 --> 01:40:26.920]  And you do get fringe benefits.
[01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:28.861]  You do get better quality podcasts.
[01:40:28.861 --> 01:40:35.085]  We're adding next week a 64-kilobit stream just for members, double the quality that's free.
[01:40:35.085 --> 01:40:41.550]  We've added a live TV show component of the radio show, where at least half the show is a multi-camera shoot with documents and video clips.
[01:40:42.390 --> 01:40:56.478]  Extra-expanded DVD extras that are only for PrisonPlanet.TV members, then the members rip it off PrisonPlanet.TV, which we appreciate, and post it to the Four Winds in lower quality.
[01:40:56.478 --> 01:40:57.339]  But that doesn't matter.
[01:40:57.339 --> 01:41:05.604]  The point is, when you're a PrisonPlanet.TV member, you can also burn DivX copies that play on almost all new... in the last few years, almost all new DVD players.
[01:41:05.604 --> 01:41:07.985]  It's not even new DVD players anymore.
[01:41:07.985 --> 01:41:11.267]  I guess a lot of DVD players have had DivX on them for about five years now.
[01:41:12.335 --> 01:41:17.904]  But the point is, you can download it in that format, you can stream it, a bunch of different formats.
[01:41:17.904 --> 01:41:19.406]  The quality is getting better and better.
[01:41:19.406 --> 01:41:23.132]  We're attempting to go to actual high def.
[01:41:25.043 --> 01:41:26.163]  For some of the new releases.
[01:41:26.163 --> 01:41:31.685]  In fact, we're working on having this one in actual high def if you choose to download it or watch it in that quality.
[01:41:31.685 --> 01:41:34.326]  You've got to have a really good connection to do that.
[01:41:34.326 --> 01:41:40.188]  But it is your support of PrisonPlanet.tv that makes this radio show possible.
[01:41:40.188 --> 01:41:43.829]  And it is your support of buying the DVDs.
[01:41:43.829 --> 01:41:45.509]  And you see them in the highest quality.
[01:41:45.509 --> 01:41:47.630]  They're in a nice color cover case.
[01:41:48.470 --> 01:41:53.715]  Your friends, your family are more likely to watch them if you give them a copy that's in a nice case.
[01:41:53.715 --> 01:41:55.057]  You're authorized to make copies.
[01:41:55.057 --> 01:42:02.625]  If you're going to be making copies, the best way to do it is not from some online cruddy, you know, version out there, but to do it from PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:42:02.625 --> 01:42:07.810]  We have the tools up there for you, or from the actual DVD.
[01:42:07.810 --> 01:42:08.691]  Two new films
[01:42:10.347 --> 01:42:20.870]  And I'm good at making films, and Burmese is good at making films, but I'm not really good at even chronicling and documenting and covering everything that's in these films for you.
[01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:36.955]  I mean, Police State 4 covers the entire police state, FEMA camp, COG, government takeover, Glenn Beck's lying, the G20, the sound cannons, the executive orders, the secret arrests, the torture, it's all covered.
[01:42:36.955 --> 01:42:38.435]  Two hours, 20-something minutes long.
[01:42:39.935 --> 01:42:45.478]  Invisible Empire, incredible film!
[01:42:45.478 --> 01:42:47.239]  I mean, how do I even describe what's in this?
[01:42:47.239 --> 01:42:48.680]  You can go read Kurt Nemo's write-up.
[01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:49.880]  He's now seen it.
[01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:51.081]  Wrote a glowing review yesterday.
[01:42:51.081 --> 01:42:51.942]  You can watch the trailer.
[01:42:51.942 --> 01:43:01.727]  I mean, how do you describe a two-hour, 15-minute-plus film with a whole bunch of extras that just covers government drug dealing, white slavery rings, pedophile rings?
[01:43:01.727 --> 01:43:03.648]  That's only a small part of the film.
[01:43:03.648 --> 01:43:09.211]  How the roundtable groups control society, what their goals are, false flag terror, the latest developments there.
[01:43:10.939 --> 01:43:11.919]  It just goes on and on.
[01:43:11.919 --> 01:43:14.861]  I mean, it just covers everything.
[01:43:14.861 --> 01:43:18.082]  It's Invisible Empire, a new world order, defined.
[01:43:18.082 --> 01:43:25.685]  Order them both on DVD today so you get them shipped out to you first, or get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[01:43:25.685 --> 01:43:37.831]  We're only like 18, 19 days away from the release of Invisible Empire, and we're, what, about 25 days away from the release of Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[01:43:38.973 --> 01:43:40.754]  And they both come out in April.
[01:43:40.754 --> 01:43:42.395]  April 15th and April 21st.
[01:43:42.395 --> 01:43:43.936]  Two films in one month.
[01:43:43.936 --> 01:43:45.016]  And we didn't plan it that way.
[01:43:45.016 --> 01:43:46.417]  That's just the way they're coming out together.
[01:43:46.417 --> 01:43:51.159]  And you can get them discounted when you buy both of them at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:43:51.159 --> 01:43:52.660]  888-253-3139 or PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:43:52.660 --> 01:43:56.662]  It takes about one minute to sign up at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:05.479 --> 01:44:10.040]  And six people can be logged on with the same passcode.
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:11.780]  It maxes out after that.
[01:44:11.780 --> 01:44:22.843]  But you can share it with a few of your friends and family, be yourself at PrisonPlanet.tv membership, and then send the username and passcode to a couple of your friends and family, but explain to them, don't share it with anybody else or it'll lock them out.
[01:44:22.843 --> 01:44:26.604]  If I could afford it, it would all just be free.
[01:44:26.604 --> 01:44:31.365]  But I'm not Google.
[01:44:31.365 --> 01:44:31.785]  So again,
[01:44:33.883 --> 01:44:54.674]  I sacrifice a lot making as much of this free as I can, and then you sacrifice $5.95 a month, the cost of two cups of coffee, and you get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership that you can then share with five people.
[01:44:54.674 --> 01:44:59.757]  Really, that's like six memberships for $5.95 a month, or get a year membership and get three months free.
[01:45:04.158 --> 01:45:08.600]  PrisonPlanet.tv or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:17.203]  Alright, I got a lot of news in your phone calls and Bob Chapman, I just wanted to speak my mind on this and to explain to you the mindset I'm in.
[01:45:17.203 --> 01:45:20.084]  I'm so busy we've only made one trailer for each film.
[01:45:20.084 --> 01:45:22.285]  I haven't even made radio ads yet for the films.
[01:45:24.844 --> 01:45:30.205]  I'm not complaining, it's just I don't even have the staff or the money to advertise the films elsewhere.
[01:45:30.205 --> 01:45:33.666]  It's all up to you how big these films are.
[01:45:33.666 --> 01:45:41.048]  The biggest film we've ever made, ever released, is Obama Deception.
[01:45:41.048 --> 01:45:42.408]  And it shatters the left-right paradigm.
[01:45:42.408 --> 01:45:44.489]  That's because you made it big.
[01:45:44.489 --> 01:45:47.290]  You carried the ball.
[01:45:47.290 --> 01:45:49.930]  The second most powerful film, Endgame.
[01:45:49.930 --> 01:45:53.111]  Before that, next biggest film, Road to Tyranny.
[01:45:58.194 --> 01:46:03.116]  Obama deception really scared the system.
[01:46:03.116 --> 01:46:07.117]  That's when I made all the big enemies list for the White House and everywhere else.
[01:46:07.117 --> 01:46:08.958]  That's when they really started coming after me.
[01:46:08.958 --> 01:46:10.258]  And I've had national news here.
[01:46:10.258 --> 01:46:16.100]  I've had Chris Matthews crew here and they said, yeah, that film, that film's everywhere.
[01:46:16.100 --> 01:46:18.821]  I'd say conservatively 50 million free views online.
[01:46:21.129 --> 01:46:23.010]  $100,000 film to make.
[01:46:23.010 --> 01:46:27.851]  50 million people have seen it, and that's conservative.
[01:46:27.851 --> 01:46:40.573]  Not counting 30,000 at the University of Arizona in Phoenix.
[01:46:40.573 --> 01:46:43.534]  On record, they videotaped the warehouse full.
[01:46:43.534 --> 01:46:46.875]  They had the students as volunteers made
[01:46:48.412 --> 01:46:50.953]  30,000 that they gave out at two events.
[01:46:50.953 --> 01:46:52.693]  30,000!
[01:46:52.693 --> 01:46:54.794]  And that's going on all over the country.
[01:46:54.794 --> 01:46:56.394]  That's why the system's in trouble.
[01:46:56.394 --> 01:46:58.655]  And no amount of their propaganda can fix it.
[01:46:58.655 --> 01:47:00.655]  They're going to stage terror attacks.
[01:47:00.655 --> 01:47:01.835]  They're going to blow stuff up.
[01:47:01.835 --> 01:47:05.376]  They're probably going to try to put me in prison sooner rather than later.
[01:47:05.376 --> 01:47:09.317]  But because I understand what they're doing and have exposed their game plan, I may be safe.
[01:47:09.317 --> 01:47:11.278]  Plus, God's protecting me because of your prayers.
[01:47:13.138 --> 01:47:15.239]  Whatever the cost, I'm not stopping.
[01:47:15.239 --> 01:47:19.861]  It's a good feeling to be past the point of no return and to be in a fight for your life, folks.
[01:47:19.861 --> 01:47:21.342]  And let me give you a little news tip here.
[01:47:21.342 --> 01:47:22.963]  We're all in a fight for our lives.
[01:47:22.963 --> 01:47:29.866]  This is real, hardcore, bonafide evil.
[01:47:29.866 --> 01:47:33.948]  This is real dictatorship of the elite.
[01:47:33.948 --> 01:47:37.250]  Their puppets come and go, but the same scum stays in place.
[01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:39.711]  Okay, let's talk to Jason in North Carolina here on the air.
[01:47:41.667 --> 01:47:46.829]  Alex, thanks for having me on DOT TV subscriber.
[01:47:46.829 --> 01:47:48.010]  Thank you.
[01:47:48.010 --> 01:47:48.650]  You bet, sir.
[01:47:48.650 --> 01:47:49.790]  Thank you.
[01:47:49.790 --> 01:47:51.471]  A couple of things.
[01:47:51.471 --> 01:47:53.032]  I'll make it quick.
[01:47:53.032 --> 01:48:03.356]  First thing I'd like to say is our Congress is despicable and it's been... I just think they've been despicable for some time based on their voting record.
[01:48:03.356 --> 01:48:10.079]  I sent an email out to some of my friends last week that had the voting records on both NAFTA
[01:48:10.911 --> 01:48:16.260]  And, uh, the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999.
[01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:23.891]  And I think that, I don't know, I'm sure you're aware of how many senators actually have actually voted against repealing the Glass-Steagall Act.
[01:48:24.926 --> 01:48:27.888]  Before I looked it up, I had no idea just how significant it was.
[01:48:27.888 --> 01:48:35.672]  There was only seven senators who voted against repealing that act in 1999, so... Absolutely, and it was bipartisan.
[01:48:35.672 --> 01:48:39.255]  Clinton, Bush, Obama, all work for the banks.
[01:48:39.255 --> 01:48:40.796]  They are nothing but a distraction.
[01:48:41.736 --> 01:48:46.479]  And unless we realize that's what this insurance takeover is, we're going to lose this.
[01:48:46.479 --> 01:48:51.103]  If we let the Democrats pose as if we're nice, we gave poor people something free.
[01:48:51.103 --> 01:48:55.566]  They are a pack of criminal scum liars, and so are the Republicans.
[01:48:55.566 --> 01:48:59.449]  The Republican leadership knows full well what this is all about.
[01:48:59.449 --> 01:49:03.111]  Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more, and it's just, it's very sobering.
[01:49:03.111 --> 01:49:08.475]  I don't know how you can trust, I mean again, 2,700 page bill that nobody reads, and
[01:49:08.891 --> 01:49:20.775]  The Patriot Act is still going as strong as ever, and I know quote-unquote Democrat relatives and friends who are in complete denial of this.
[01:49:20.775 --> 01:49:25.056]  In fact, one of them said, oh yeah, that's just a stimulus package in essence.
[01:49:25.056 --> 01:49:26.236]  It creates jobs.
[01:49:26.236 --> 01:49:30.178]  And I was just looking at these people like, you know, it's like talking to
[01:49:31.528 --> 01:49:31.888]  Idiots.
[01:49:31.888 --> 01:49:32.648]  I don't know.
[01:49:32.648 --> 01:49:33.689]  Yeah, it really is.
[01:49:33.689 --> 01:49:35.669]  I was thinking about that this morning.
[01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:54.855]  My biggest frustration is seeing people get conned and hurt and they have this giggling, self-assured, foolish smile on their face like they're part of the system and they're associating their identity with Obama and with Joe Biden, just like Republicans associating their identity with Bush.
[01:49:55.575 --> 01:49:58.700]  And Republicans telling me Bush isn't for the assault weapons ban?
[01:49:58.700 --> 01:49:59.942]  You're a liar!
[01:49:59.942 --> 01:50:01.404]  And loving their ignorance.
[01:50:01.404 --> 01:50:02.726]  They think it's so cute.
[01:50:02.726 --> 01:50:04.929]  They're so satisfied in it.
[01:50:04.929 --> 01:50:08.995]  They love the fact that they're being conned.
[01:50:08.995 --> 01:50:10.798]  It's a nation of children.
[01:50:10.798 --> 01:50:11.139]  Go ahead.
[01:50:11.914 --> 01:50:12.814]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:50:12.814 --> 01:50:17.497]  And they do usually grin when they say it, which you're spot on about that, unfortunately.
[01:50:17.497 --> 01:50:18.517]  Oh no, it's a pleasure!
[01:50:18.517 --> 01:50:20.758]  It's an enjoyment!
[01:50:20.758 --> 01:50:27.462]  Because they think you're just some right winger and they're beating you and this is their time and they're showing you right now.
[01:50:27.462 --> 01:50:28.762]  Oh, they're so good!
[01:50:30.003 --> 01:50:30.704]  Punch it.
[01:50:30.704 --> 01:50:31.985]  And that's why they're going into bondage.
[01:50:31.985 --> 01:50:48.501]  The elite look at these schmucks, they look at these sacks of stupid garbage, they look at these wanton fools, and they say, rape them, rape them hard, take everything they got, poison their water, dumb their kids down, cut their Medicare and Medicaid, and these little slimeballs are gonna thank us.
[01:50:48.501 --> 01:50:55.067]  And those gangsters sit up there, and Biden looks at Obama, Barry Sitaro, and says, this is a big effin' deal.
[01:50:55.487 --> 01:50:57.328]  We're bringing this scum down!
[01:50:57.328 --> 01:50:58.929]  This is good!
[01:50:58.929 --> 01:51:00.651]  The healing revolution is here.

[01:51:28.225 --> 01:51:29.466]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:51:29.466 --> 01:51:34.028]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:51:34.028 --> 01:51:39.610]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[01:51:39.650 --> 01:51:40.250]  We're good to go.
[01:51:58.573 --> 01:51:59.874]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:59.874 --> 01:52:05.460]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:05.460 --> 01:52:10.485]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:10.485 --> 01:52:16.071]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:16.071 --> 01:52:20.756]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:21.274 --> 01:52:28.395]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:28.395 --> 01:52:29.516]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:29.516 --> 01:52:32.576]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:52:32.576 --> 01:52:36.197]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:36.197 --> 01:52:39.377]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:39.377 --> 01:52:42.538]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:42.538 --> 01:52:42.718]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:49.885 --> 01:52:50.406]  0365.
[01:52:50.406 --> 01:52:55.252]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:55.252 --> 01:52:57.636]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:58.340 --> 01:53:07.384]  Eight years, thousands of clients worldwide, amazing results, and here's more proof of the effectiveness of how Heart and Body Extract can help your body clean its arteries.
[01:53:07.384 --> 01:53:08.704]  My name is Crystal.
[01:53:08.704 --> 01:53:11.626]  I'm a 45-year-old and live in Houston, Texas.
[01:53:11.626 --> 01:53:15.587]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[01:53:15.587 --> 01:53:19.809]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[01:53:19.809 --> 01:53:20.990]  What did Crystal do?
[01:53:20.990 --> 01:53:23.030]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.
[01:53:24.662 --> 01:53:31.084]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.
[01:53:31.084 --> 01:53:35.045]  Clean, clear arteries are happy arteries after using Heart and Body Extract.
[01:53:35.045 --> 01:53:37.626]  Learn more at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[01:53:37.626 --> 01:53:38.686]  That's HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[01:53:45.148 --> 01:53:45.709]  We're good.
[01:54:13.212 --> 01:54:17.453]  Getting ready to go live at PrisonPlanet.tv in the third and fourth hour.
[01:54:17.453 --> 01:54:18.233]  Bob Chapman coming up.
[01:54:18.233 --> 01:54:22.254]  I'm going to go to your calls in this segment and the next.
[01:54:22.254 --> 01:54:31.156]  Look, I get angry at people that are willfully ignorant, and I shouldn't call them names, but they need to be psychologically slapped around or have a bucket of cold water thrown on them.
[01:54:32.475 --> 01:54:35.397]  They're followers, and they think they're on a winning team.
[01:54:35.397 --> 01:54:40.862]  It's like people whose identity is wearing their favorite sports teams' ball caps and jerseys.
[01:54:40.862 --> 01:54:47.807]  And that's fine, but that's a facsimile or a twisted version of human tribalism.
[01:54:47.807 --> 01:54:56.154]  You should owe your allegiance to your family, and to your republic, and to the rights that protect you that your forefathers and mothers fought and died for.
[01:54:58.087 --> 01:55:07.113]  And it's just like Republicans, when they're in power, they let their leadership do whatever they want because the media all phrases it like, oh, the Democrats don't want torture.
[01:55:07.113 --> 01:55:09.214]  The Democrats don't want banker bailouts.
[01:55:09.214 --> 01:55:11.276]  The Democrats don't want new wars.
[01:55:11.276 --> 01:55:12.957]  The Democrats don't want a police state.
[01:55:14.318 --> 01:55:19.444]  And then as soon as the Democrats get in power, they don't just want all of that, they accelerate it.
[01:55:19.444 --> 01:55:26.251]  And then suddenly, oh, Republicans are against torture and war and banker bailouts and health care.
[01:55:26.251 --> 01:55:28.994]  And so the Democrats all go, well, I'm going to support it then.
[01:55:28.994 --> 01:55:33.779]  If the Republicans, you know, if George W. Bush says global warming isn't real, I believe it's real.
[01:55:33.779 --> 01:55:35.221]  And then he capitulated and went along with it.
[01:55:37.901 --> 01:55:52.817]  And when I'm here talking about my films, the fact that we don't sell that many because people can get them for free, I'd rather have 50 million people see The Obama Deception for free than have a million dollars.
[01:55:52.817 --> 01:55:52.897]  See?
[01:55:54.153 --> 01:55:56.014]  It's a values issue.
[01:55:56.014 --> 01:55:58.494]  I value every person we reach.
[01:55:58.494 --> 01:56:00.595]  I value every person we wake up.
[01:56:00.595 --> 01:56:02.016]  That's what's important to me.
[01:56:02.016 --> 01:56:03.096]  That's my goal.
[01:56:03.096 --> 01:56:04.677]  That's why I've been successful.
[01:56:04.677 --> 01:56:13.099]  All these other people that just want to make money, they haven't been successful because that's their only goal.
[01:56:13.099 --> 01:56:20.522]  Or other people that put out films and hoard them, they end up selling more and making some money, but they're not reaching as many people.
[01:56:22.068 --> 01:56:27.873]  And conversely, they're not as well known, which is what these money grubbers actually want in the final equation.
[01:56:27.873 --> 01:56:34.659]  That's what they're looking for, but they don't get it because they're so jealously trying to hold everything into themselves.
[01:56:34.659 --> 01:56:36.780]  Whereas I just want to reach people.
[01:56:36.780 --> 01:56:38.302]  So we are successful.
[01:56:38.302 --> 01:56:48.290]  And I had no idea 14 years ago, when I set out to make a film and to do everything we've done here, that I would be so successful because I was coming at it
[01:56:50.822 --> 01:57:06.049]  I'm not saying I'm a perfect person and I've got plenty of problems, but my son said to me last night, he said, daddy, I listened to your show sometimes and you have a lion's heart.
[01:57:06.049 --> 01:57:07.810]  And I said, what is a lion's heart?
[01:57:07.810 --> 01:57:12.793]  I knew what the definition of a lion's heart is.
[01:57:12.793 --> 01:57:17.195]  And he said, well, you care about people and you have courage and you want to help people.
[01:57:19.187 --> 01:57:29.295]  And throughout my life, I have had a good-natured view of the world, and I have wanted to help others, and I thought other people were all like me.
[01:57:29.295 --> 01:57:38.963]  And we need the lion-hearted individuals out there, the people who have strength, who have the intellects, to get off the bench and to go out there and to take action.
[01:57:38.963 --> 01:57:43.506]  But that meant so much to me when my son said, you are lion-hearted.
[01:57:43.506 --> 01:57:48.190]  Seven years old, he's already reading high school-level books, voracious history reader,
[01:57:49.645 --> 01:57:54.230]  Much smarter than I am, and to have him tell me that I'm a lion heart.
[01:57:54.230 --> 01:58:02.198]  Well, some days I am, some days I'm more like a devil heart, because that is the duality of man, and then there's that struggle.
[01:58:02.198 --> 01:58:05.501]  Angel pulling you one way, the devil pulling you the other.
[01:58:05.501 --> 01:58:08.003]  But I do strive to be lion hearted.
[01:58:08.003 --> 01:58:12.188]  And I did come at this from an open hearted, altruistic,
[01:58:13.103 --> 01:58:38.853]  perspective of really trying to stand up against corruption and trying to protect the innocent and that's why I've been so successful and that's why it's important for those of you out there who know that you're good of heart and that you have the best interest of people in mind and that those of you that do want to sacrifice for liberty you need to stand up and take action because the world needs good people.

[02:00:19.855 --> 02:00:22.057]  Okay, I haven't done a good job of going to your calls.
[02:00:22.057 --> 02:00:24.658]  I will throughout this entire hour with Bob Chapman.
[02:00:24.658 --> 02:00:28.881]  We're going live at PrisonPlanet.tv for the balance of the transmission in the next segment.
[02:00:28.881 --> 02:00:33.124]  Let's talk to Carrie, then Tim, David, Tim, and others.
[02:00:33.124 --> 02:00:34.626]  We've got a caller from Brazil there.
[02:00:34.626 --> 02:00:38.768]  Maybe I should skip ahead to Brazil, but let's go to Carrie in Wisconsin first.
[02:00:38.768 --> 02:00:40.510]  You're on the air.
[02:00:40.510 --> 02:00:46.054]  Hey Alex, I think this is what Krafft Ronson Fitz would call a pump and dump with this health care bill.
[02:00:46.054 --> 02:00:47.755]  It's the same thing that the
[02:00:48.353 --> 02:00:48.794]  We're good to go.
[02:01:02.031 --> 02:01:07.013]  Of all the mortgages and the banks getting the money from it, it's going to take probably five years.
[02:01:07.013 --> 02:01:09.974]  Well, Carrie, I agree with you, but it's worse than that.
[02:01:09.974 --> 02:01:16.537]  The government is the muscle and the manager that implements it, but the profit all goes to offshore banks.
[02:01:16.537 --> 02:01:23.920]  And yes, they're going to... healthcare costs are already exploding this week, because the more money you dump in, the more bureaucracy, the more the cost goes up.
[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:25.360]  Yeah, and you know,
[02:01:47.631 --> 02:01:57.176]  It's proven the fact that they have the IRS collecting this money, that the money is going to the banks, which as you say, all insurance companies, all insurance companies are financial institutions.
[02:01:57.176 --> 02:02:03.880]  GEICO is not owned by a lizard, it's owned by Berkshire Hathaway, which is Warren Buffett's multi-multi-billion dollar investment.
[02:02:03.880 --> 02:02:07.281]  And who's one of the biggest lobbyists for the health bill?
[02:02:07.281 --> 02:02:10.263]  Warren, the eugenicist, Pig, Buffett.
[02:02:11.385 --> 02:02:11.945]  Absolutely.
[02:02:11.945 --> 02:02:18.307]  He has a lot of, uh, his firm owns a lot of stock and corporate bonds in all of the various insurance companies.
[02:02:18.307 --> 02:02:31.029]  But as you know, the church committee under Reagan, what, nearly 30 years ago, proved that 100% of the money that the IRS collects goes to the private banking cartel that runs the financial reserve system.
[02:02:31.029 --> 02:02:33.810]  So the fact that the IRS is going to be the collection agency
[02:02:34.417 --> 02:02:41.925]  For this so-called health care reform bill is proof of who the money is going to.
[02:02:41.925 --> 02:02:43.647]  That's the banker's errand boy.
[02:02:43.647 --> 02:02:55.380]  The same day we got the Federal Reserve, we got the income tax back in 1913, or in that same month, because that's the collection agency and this is the private mafia's
[02:02:56.306 --> 02:03:03.812]  Absolutely, and I was wondering if you could ask Bob Chapman when he comes on to comment yesterday on what happened in the treasury market.
[02:03:18.669 --> 02:03:32.998]  With the Treasury Auction because it was a real shaker and of course what you were asking him, you could say you were going to ask him earlier about how all of the bank-owned insurance companies, so-called healthcare companies, are rallying off of this.
[02:03:32.998 --> 02:03:34.579]  Because of course they're rallying off of this.
[02:03:34.579 --> 02:03:45.246]  They've basically been, they've basically now gained GSE status, Government Sponsored Enterprise, just like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and Sally Mae and Ginnie Mae.
[02:03:45.246 --> 02:03:48.148]  All of those are so-called private corporations.
[02:03:48.567 --> 02:03:51.209]  Publicly held, but private as in non-governmental.
[02:03:51.209 --> 02:04:00.735]  But 100% of their debt, everything they do is backed by the government with the promise that the government will cover all of their wrongdoing by extracting money from the taxpayers.
[02:04:00.735 --> 02:04:10.241]  And they get to cut the quality, they get to raise the price, they get to cut Medicare and Medicaid, it doesn't cover kids with pre-existing conditions, it doesn't let you choose your doctor.
[02:04:10.241 --> 02:04:12.242]  Paul Watson's got an article about that.
[02:04:12.242 --> 02:04:13.143]  It is a total
[02:04:13.963 --> 02:04:19.206]  Rape system phased in over eight years, but Obama said, hey, it's past a couple days.
[02:04:19.206 --> 02:04:21.428]  The birds are still tweeting.
[02:04:21.428 --> 02:04:28.692]  Knowing that people won't notice it overnight, they'll kind of forget about it as they slowly strangle freedom in the dark of the night.
[02:04:28.692 --> 02:04:30.733]  Excellent call, Kerry.
[02:04:30.733 --> 02:04:31.974]  Tim, David.
[02:04:32.794 --> 02:04:39.519]  Tim and Brazil, others, your call's coming up with Bob Chapman, TheInternationalForecaster.com, and Bob was listening.
[02:04:39.519 --> 02:04:42.281]  He'll be able to comment on your bond market question.
[02:04:42.281 --> 02:04:44.003]  We'll discuss what's happening in Greece.
[02:04:44.003 --> 02:04:49.607]  We'll get Bob's expert opinion on the health care rape takeover, and a lot more.
[02:04:49.607 --> 02:04:52.149]  It's Friday, the 26th day of March, 2010.

[02:05:59.787 --> 02:06:05.130]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:06:05.130 --> 02:06:07.171]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:06:07.171 --> 02:06:12.173]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:06:12.173 --> 02:06:13.353]  How much do you want?
[02:06:13.353 --> 02:06:14.474]  When do you want it?
[02:06:14.474 --> 02:06:16.355]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:06:16.355 --> 02:06:17.435]  When will you need it?
[02:06:17.435 --> 02:06:19.636]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:06:19.636 --> 02:06:20.977]  Will there be any food?
[02:06:20.977 --> 02:06:22.498]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:06:22.498 --> 02:06:23.518]  If there's a quarantine,
[02:06:23.718 --> 02:06:24.119]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:40.422 --> 02:06:43.464]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:06:43.464 --> 02:06:45.566]  Call 1-800-409-5633.

[02:06:51.010 --> 02:06:52.191]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:06:52.191 --> 02:07:02.839]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.

[02:07:25.049 --> 02:07:29.793]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:07:29.793 --> 02:07:33.596]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[02:07:33.596 --> 02:07:34.837]  Others don't.
[02:07:34.837 --> 02:07:36.999]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:07:36.999 --> 02:07:38.780]  Diamond gusset jeans.

[02:07:41.662 --> 02:07:45.906]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.

[02:07:50.990 --> 02:07:53.372]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[02:07:53.372 --> 02:07:54.233]  Others don't.
[02:07:56.849 --> 02:08:06.635]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:06.635 --> 02:08:10.197]  Okay, Bob Chapman is our guest for the next 50 plus minutes.
[02:08:10.197 --> 02:08:12.319]  We may be holding a little bit of the next hour if he wants to.
[02:08:12.319 --> 02:08:16.421]  We're going to be going to your calls very, very early in this hour.
[02:08:16.421 --> 02:08:17.222]  We're going to talk about
[02:08:18.413 --> 02:08:23.236]  The financial slash military operations of the private banking cartel.
[02:08:23.236 --> 02:08:29.560]  They staged terror attacks as a pretext to put their police state grid in place.
[02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:36.345]  And they staged financial collapse to get countries deeper into debt to them until they're fully bankrupt.
[02:08:36.345 --> 02:08:41.168]  Then they have to adopt all the laws and regulations that the banks order them to put into place.
[02:08:41.168 --> 02:08:44.170]  And the number one law is one-child policy.
[02:08:44.730 --> 02:08:46.772]  So this is a scientific dictatorship.
[02:08:46.772 --> 02:08:49.015]  We'll be talking about Greece and a lot more.
[02:08:49.015 --> 02:09:02.949]  Plus the Democrats all over television, all over radio, in the White House calling for the Cybersecurity Act, calling for banning free speech, calling for taking Rush Limbaugh off the radio, saying they can have their political views but he can't have his.
[02:09:02.949 --> 02:09:06.092]  Now I don't like Ed Schultz and I don't like a lot of stuff Rush Limbaugh does either.
[02:09:06.693 --> 02:09:19.402]  They're both establishment phonies if you ask me, but Limbaugh is starting to change a little bit and saying world government's real, they may suspend the election, Obama may stage a crisis, and now they're really talking about going after him.
[02:09:19.402 --> 02:09:28.409]  And the reason Limbaugh is being allowed to do this is, you've got a nouveau riche and new wealth power structure that is starting to realize they're not going to be at the top of the pyramid.
[02:09:29.468 --> 02:09:32.432]  And they're starting to realize that this is a hot tyranny.
[02:09:32.432 --> 02:09:37.519]  And there's a real takeover of the Republican Party from the grassroots right now.
[02:09:37.519 --> 02:09:39.962]  And so their listeners are demanding they tell the truth.
[02:09:41.860 --> 02:09:43.721]  They become inconsequential.
[02:09:43.721 --> 02:09:45.303]  They don't even matter anymore.
[02:09:45.303 --> 02:09:47.264]  They're not even pertinent anymore.
[02:09:47.264 --> 02:09:48.565]  What's the word I'm looking for?
[02:09:48.565 --> 02:09:51.027]  You know, to stay relevant.
[02:09:51.027 --> 02:10:00.695]  We are forcing the debate, not to the left, not to the right, but into real issues of populism and constitutional law and freedom.
[02:10:01.235 --> 02:10:04.338]  We are going into bondage right now on every front.
[02:10:04.338 --> 02:10:16.111]  They're moving for amnesty, the carbon taxes, the open borders, the police state, the Northcom, the naked body scanners to be in mobile trucks on the streets, being announced by Homeland Security.
[02:10:16.111 --> 02:10:20.496]  They're moving right now because they know they're behind schedule and people are waking up.
[02:10:21.525 --> 02:10:23.567]  So, don't be depressed out there.
[02:10:23.567 --> 02:10:26.010]  Get fired up, get aggressive, get active.
[02:10:26.010 --> 02:10:30.615]  But the establishment is preparing to stage terror attacks and blame it on the Tea Parties.
[02:10:30.615 --> 02:10:32.037]  I've been predicting all of this.
[02:10:32.037 --> 02:10:33.719]  You now see it unfolding.
[02:10:33.719 --> 02:10:36.722]  So we're going to Bob Chapman and your phone calls here in just a moment.
[02:10:36.722 --> 02:10:38.844]  I wanted to tell you about one of our sponsors today.
[02:10:39.685 --> 02:10:41.025]  Akola Blue.
[02:10:41.025 --> 02:10:42.986]  Once a month, Akola Blue will have a special.

[02:10:45.206 --> 02:10:53.828]  One of their medium-sized units that grabs water out of the air and puts it through 12-stage filtering process and stores it in a stainless steel tank.
[02:10:53.828 --> 02:10:56.889]  Beautiful little unit, looks like a water cooler without the water bottle.

[02:11:02.590 --> 02:11:06.010]  The code to get free shipping is Alex Jones.
[02:11:06.010 --> 02:11:08.311]  One word, yours truly, Alex Jones.
[02:11:08.971 --> 02:11:12.717]  Or you can give him a call at 800-691-6043 and tell him Alex Jones sent you to get the free shipping.
[02:11:12.717 --> 02:11:12.777]  800-691-6043.
[02:11:12.777 --> 02:11:12.837]  Ok.
[02:11:12.837 --> 02:11:13.378]  Going to Bob Chapman.
[02:11:25.936 --> 02:11:27.758]  Bob, so much is happening in the world.
[02:11:27.758 --> 02:11:36.949]  Most listeners don't need me to introduce you, but your former Army intelligence, one of the biggest private silver and gold brokers, had the biggest private newsletter until you retired.
[02:11:36.949 --> 02:11:41.034]  You've come back in the last few years doing a great job with the International Forecaster.
[02:11:41.034 --> 02:11:43.878]  Your predictions are among some of the most accurate.
[02:11:44.963 --> 02:11:48.307]  That we've had with any guest, Gerald Cilente, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:11:48.307 --> 02:11:52.532]  By the way, I said I'd get into Dr. Paul Craig Roberts saying he's quitting two days ago.
[02:11:52.532 --> 02:11:53.533]  I talked to him off-air.
[02:11:53.533 --> 02:11:54.594]  I said I'd cover it yesterday.
[02:11:54.594 --> 02:11:55.695]  I didn't.
[02:11:55.695 --> 02:11:59.920]  Remind me in the last hour to at least mention what he said off-air to me or maybe later in this hour.
[02:12:00.280 --> 02:12:01.781]  Just make sure I cover it.
[02:12:01.781 --> 02:12:08.905]  There's so much going on, but Bob, you want to talk about the health care first and how it ties into a larger plan, more money for the banks.
[02:12:08.905 --> 02:12:16.350]  The IRS is their collection agency to be their mafia enforcer to come to your door to collect it, to run your bank account, to take money out of your bank account.
[02:12:16.350 --> 02:12:22.814]  Do you want to get into what's happening in Greece with the IMF saying they're going to come in with Western money and fully take over?
[02:12:22.814 --> 02:12:25.896]  What's most important to Bob Chapman right now?
[02:12:25.896 --> 02:12:27.957]  Well, I think the call-up from Brazil.
[02:12:28.388 --> 02:12:34.991]  Let's take him and then we'll go into that other stuff and that very smart lady that you just had on a few minutes ago.
[02:12:34.991 --> 02:12:36.752]  Okay, let's talk to Tim in Brazil.
[02:12:36.752 --> 02:12:38.472]  Tim, you're on the air.
[02:12:38.472 --> 02:12:39.953]  Alex Jones, Bob Chapman.
[02:12:39.953 --> 02:12:41.534]  Nice to talk to you guys.
[02:12:41.534 --> 02:12:43.715]  I'm a big fan.
[02:12:43.715 --> 02:12:45.135]  My name's Tenacious Tim Anderson.
[02:12:45.135 --> 02:12:49.077]  I'm a professional wrestler on tour, actually, here in Brazil.
[02:12:49.077 --> 02:12:50.278]  I live in Sao Paulo.
[02:12:50.278 --> 02:12:55.060]  I wanted to call in and let you guys hear what's going on down here.
[02:12:55.060 --> 02:12:57.381]  Alex Jones is not joking around with this.
[02:12:58.581 --> 02:13:02.044]  This world banking cartel and their police state.
[02:13:02.044 --> 02:13:06.709]  I experience it every day of my life, traveling.
[02:13:06.709 --> 02:13:13.695]  These guys, the military police, are all over the city streets where I live.
[02:13:13.695 --> 02:13:16.398]  They like to intimidate people a lot.
[02:13:16.398 --> 02:13:22.784]  The public here has a very, very standoffish type of attitude with the government here.
[02:13:23.390 --> 02:13:30.073]  They're very scared of the government here, and the tax here is incredible at 30% of importation.
[02:13:30.073 --> 02:13:36.476]  So you pay whatever you paid to import something, and then you pay 30% tax on top of that.
[02:13:36.476 --> 02:13:42.839]  On top of that, you know, the Brazilian government is trying to act like they have, you know, kind of a struggle with U.S.
[02:13:42.839 --> 02:13:46.000]  foreign relation ties, and really all it is is
[02:13:47.279 --> 02:13:47.819]  I live here.
[02:13:47.819 --> 02:13:48.700]  I know what's going on.
[02:13:48.700 --> 02:13:49.260]  I see it.
[02:13:49.260 --> 02:13:52.082]  They're actually using U.N.
[02:13:52.082 --> 02:13:53.323]  and U.S.
[02:13:53.323 --> 02:13:56.985]  foreign policy right now to enforce this police state.
[02:13:56.985 --> 02:13:57.846]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:13:57.846 --> 02:14:02.509]  The so-called leftists down there are all in bed with the IMF and World Bank.
[02:14:02.509 --> 02:14:04.010]  Anything else, Tim?
[02:14:04.010 --> 02:14:04.710]  No, that's it.
[02:14:04.710 --> 02:14:05.551]  You guys have a nice day.
[02:14:06.690 --> 02:14:11.374]  And places like Argentina, Brazil were much more wealthy, much more free.
[02:14:11.374 --> 02:14:13.056]  The IMF, World Bank comes in.
[02:14:13.056 --> 02:14:16.979]  They pay off your politicians to not pay back the debt.
[02:14:16.979 --> 02:14:21.403]  You can only spend the IMF and World Bank money on what they tell you you could spend it on.
[02:14:21.403 --> 02:14:23.545]  That's with their companies that they own.
[02:14:23.545 --> 02:14:25.607]  Bob Chapman.
[02:14:25.607 --> 02:14:31.612]  Well, first of all, it wasn't too long ago I was in Brazil and what he says is true.
[02:14:31.612 --> 02:14:33.654]  And Argentina is just as bad.
[02:14:34.506 --> 02:14:42.212]  And now, of course, down across the river plot in Uruguay, in Montevideo, they have a new Marxist president.
[02:14:42.212 --> 02:14:47.937]  And so, South America's kind of heading in the wrong direction.
[02:14:47.937 --> 02:14:54.142]  But be as it may, I like to hear foreign ideas, and we got them from Tim, and thank you, Tim.
[02:14:54.142 --> 02:14:57.445]  The young lady who was on just before you got off,
[02:14:57.941 --> 02:15:06.211]  Talking about what was going on in the bond bill and note of the Treasury market.
[02:15:06.211 --> 02:15:15.342]  Last year, I backed into what I think is the privately owned Federal Reserve purchasing 80% of U.S.
[02:15:15.342 --> 02:15:16.923]  Treasury paper.
[02:15:16.923 --> 02:15:18.165]  Now that's enormous because
[02:15:18.615 --> 02:15:35.249]  The Fed has to create money out of thin air in order to do that, and it goes right into the system via the Treasury bonds, the proceeds of which are sold immediately, and it tends to be very inflationary, and we're going to see that probably in the next six months.
[02:15:35.249 --> 02:15:40.033]  They had two Treasuries sales this week.
[02:15:40.033 --> 02:15:42.735]  The first one was bills, which is $44 billion.
[02:15:42.735 --> 02:15:44.877]  The second was seven-year notes.
[02:15:46.020 --> 02:15:47.821]  Uh, which was $32 billion.
[02:15:47.821 --> 02:15:50.782]  They're averaging about $50 billion a week.
[02:15:50.782 --> 02:15:52.643]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:15:52.643 --> 02:15:54.983]  Just incredible, the amount of money.
[02:15:54.983 --> 02:16:01.226]  And they're having a hard time selling it, otherwise the Fed wouldn't be buying some of the majority of the paper.
[02:16:01.226 --> 02:16:09.749]  And the real concern out there, finally, finally it's dawning on everybody else, that global debt
[02:16:10.580 --> 02:16:13.282]  By government, it is at astronomical levels.
[02:16:13.282 --> 02:16:19.806]  There's 19 countries that are on the verge of bankruptcy, which includes the United States and Great Britain.
[02:16:19.806 --> 02:16:28.231]  And as I said the week before last on the program, where this is headed is, I think, late next year, they're going to have a meeting.
[02:16:28.231 --> 02:16:30.033]  All the countries will attend.
[02:16:30.033 --> 02:16:31.954]  They will devalue all the currencies.
[02:16:31.954 --> 02:16:34.976]  They will multilaterally default.
[02:16:35.903 --> 02:16:39.886]  And I think from there we'll go into a deflationary depression.
[02:16:39.886 --> 02:16:43.588]  So it's not too far away now.
[02:16:43.588 --> 02:16:48.991]  And so that was in answer to what she asked and what she had to say.
[02:16:48.991 --> 02:17:01.099]  I know that Bill Goss over at PIMCO, which is the largest bond manager in the world, said that the three decade bond market in bonds is over.
[02:17:03.795 --> 02:17:12.823]  And a little-known thing that's come up, very important, Ambec Financial is selling for 66 cents a share.
[02:17:12.823 --> 02:17:15.025]  They are a bond insurer.
[02:17:15.025 --> 02:17:28.958]  And what they would do is, and it was really a scam, what they would do is they would go to municipalities and say, look, we have a triple A rating, and you get a triple B, and if you come with us and let us insure your bonds,
[02:17:29.440 --> 02:17:33.264]  What will happen is you get the AAA rating, and you'll pay less money.
[02:17:33.264 --> 02:17:36.146]  And of course, you'll pay a fee to us.
[02:17:36.146 --> 02:17:43.193]  Just like the rating agencies, S&P, Moody's, Fitch, they do the same thing, only in a different area.
[02:17:43.193 --> 02:17:46.936]  And you saw the results of that with the collateralized debt obligations.
[02:17:47.426 --> 02:17:52.412]  In the trillions of dollars of losses that were caused by the misrating of those bonds.
[02:18:07.568 --> 02:18:14.933]  But as it's going up, they take the real assets and the profits they've made from the fraud, they invest them in infrastructure.
[02:18:14.933 --> 02:18:25.440]  Then when things go down, they come in and loan the money they've got from taxpayers back to the nation to then expand the debt and dependency even more.
[02:18:25.440 --> 02:18:29.143]  And it just goes in cycles, so the entire society collapses.
[02:18:29.143 --> 02:18:35.427]  The private central banks come in, seize the roads, the national parks, the resources, the water.
[02:18:35.427 --> 02:18:36.708]  They raise all the taxes.
[02:18:37.528 --> 02:18:43.089]  We know the program, but I want to come back from break and get into Bloomberg.
[02:18:43.089 --> 02:18:47.530]  Failed banks may get pension fund backing as FDIC seeks cash.
[02:18:47.530 --> 02:18:49.571]  Now you talked about this a year ago.
[02:18:49.571 --> 02:18:57.453]  Bush changed the law five years ago where they can take people's pension funds and private industry can take it and not pay you back.
[02:18:57.453 --> 02:18:58.833]  Government can take it.
[02:18:58.833 --> 02:19:02.454]  So I want to talk about how they're basically ordering mainly government
[02:19:02.754 --> 02:19:08.176]  Pension funds, fire, police, state, federal, and they admit to, quote, sure up banks.
[02:19:08.176 --> 02:19:09.596]  The banks don't need suring up.
[02:19:09.596 --> 02:19:11.397]  This is part of a criminal operation.
[02:19:11.397 --> 02:19:13.437]  I want to get your take on that.
[02:19:13.437 --> 02:19:21.980]  Then I want to talk about health care with Bob Chapman and your analysis of the health care bill and the biggest problems you have with it.
[02:19:21.980 --> 02:19:23.040]  Bob Chapman is our guest.
[02:19:23.040 --> 02:19:25.101]  We'll try to hold him a little bit to the next hour.
[02:19:25.101 --> 02:19:26.981]  I'll ask him during the break if he can do that.
[02:19:26.981 --> 02:19:31.763]  And after we talk about the health care bill, going after the pensions, the IRS getting into your bank accounts.
[02:19:32.643 --> 02:19:36.586]  Uh, and his prospectus on where this economy's going.
[02:19:36.586 --> 02:19:37.947]  We'll also take your phone calls.
[02:19:37.947 --> 02:19:39.468]  I also want to ask him if he agrees with me.
[02:19:39.468 --> 02:19:44.532]  He's been hearing me month after month here every Friday say they're going to stage terror attacks and blame it on the Tea Party.
[02:19:44.532 --> 02:19:50.517]  We now see that reaching fever pitch crescendo hype into the month of April.
[02:19:50.517 --> 02:19:54.260]  We'll be right back and get Bob Chapman's take on all this and more on Alex Jones.
[02:19:57.210 --> 02:19:57.790]  Fact!
[02:19:57.790 --> 02:19:57.950]  Fact!
[02:20:16.357 --> 02:20:20.980]  In fact, anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.

[02:20:44.993 --> 02:20:46.173]  All the goodness with none of the side effects.
[02:20:56.701 --> 02:20:57.622]  Minus resources.
[02:20:57.622 --> 02:20:57.862]  March 26, 2010.
[02:20:57.862 --> 02:20:58.963]  Gold open this morning at $10.98.50.
[02:20:58.963 --> 02:21:01.866]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $11.28.63, $5.64.32 for a half ounce, or $2.82.16 for the quarter ounce.
[02:21:01.866 --> 02:21:02.446]  That's $11.28.63, $5.64.32, or $2.82.16.
[02:21:13.797 --> 02:21:17.840]  We have always believed our country was about expanding opportunity for Americans.
[02:21:17.840 --> 02:21:23.284]  With the passage of the sweeping health care reform, working middle class Americans are getting the short end of the stick.
[02:21:23.284 --> 02:21:27.747]  The health care mandate will require almost every American to be insured or else pay a fine.
[02:21:27.747 --> 02:21:29.909]  This means less control over your finances.
[02:21:29.909 --> 02:21:32.270]  Take back control by trading in precious metals.
[02:21:32.270 --> 02:21:37.554]  Gold and silver have always been and continues to be the leading way to protect against our weakening markets.
[02:21:37.854 --> 02:21:40.915]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:21:40.915 --> 02:21:42.996]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:21:42.996 --> 02:21:44.156]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:22:07.583 --> 02:22:10.264]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:22:10.264 --> 02:22:16.646]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:22:16.646 --> 02:22:22.188]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:22:22.188 --> 02:22:31.812]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:22:31.932 --> 02:22:34.294]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:22:34.294 --> 02:22:35.876]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:22:35.876 --> 02:22:38.338]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:22:38.338 --> 02:22:40.480]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:22:40.480 --> 02:22:45.605]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:22:45.605 --> 02:22:50.630]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:22:50.630 --> 02:22:54.734]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:23:00.462 --> 02:23:06.777]  As the economy continues to decline, patriots across the nation are preparing for the worst.
[02:23:06.777 --> 02:23:09.002]  The world is changing fast.
[02:23:09.002 --> 02:23:10.446]  Are you fully prepared?
[02:23:11.212 --> 02:23:14.413]  Or will you be forced to eat government soup?
[02:23:14.413 --> 02:23:25.135]  At PatriotFood.com, we offer you 135 pounds of dehydrated food and 6 varieties of canned meat for half price.
[02:23:25.135 --> 02:23:34.818]  And at SurvivalistSeeds.com, we now offer 50 non-GMO varieties of vegetables and over 10,000 heirloom seeds.
[02:23:36.485 --> 02:23:41.329]  That's twice as many as our competition for the same price.
[02:23:41.329 --> 02:23:45.953]  Patriotfood.com and survivalistseeds.com.
[02:23:45.953 --> 02:23:48.895]  Food insurance, just in case.
[02:23:48.895 --> 02:24:00.104]  Owned by me, Big John Lipscomb.
[02:24:00.104 --> 02:24:01.966]  Alright, let's go right back to Bob Chapman.
[02:24:03.140 --> 02:24:11.286]  The banks are staging their final financial takeover of the planet publicly.
[02:24:11.286 --> 02:24:12.967]  How is it going for them in Greece?
[02:24:12.967 --> 02:24:14.648]  The IMF is coming in.
[02:24:14.648 --> 02:24:20.612]  Even the Financial Times of London admits this is a robbery, a scam, just getting them more in debt.
[02:24:20.612 --> 02:24:22.193]  Again, they lobby for more government.
[02:24:22.193 --> 02:24:23.314]  The country goes bankrupt.
[02:24:23.314 --> 02:24:27.137]  Then they come in and say, here's more loans, raise more government.
[02:24:27.137 --> 02:24:30.039]  Your take on the health care bill, where all this is going, Bob Chapman?
[02:24:31.246 --> 02:24:39.311]  Well, we'll start off with the situation in Greece.
[02:24:39.311 --> 02:24:47.375]  10-12 years ago, everybody in Europe knew Greece and Italy couldn't qualify for the Eurozone.
[02:24:47.375 --> 02:24:56.700]  Eurozone at that time was 14 nations, now it's 16, and it's 27 nations in the European Union, so you people understand.
[02:24:56.700 --> 02:24:59.302]  And so they knew this was a problem all along.
[02:25:00.146 --> 02:25:07.047]  Now, why did they pick this spot to essentially pull the plug on Greece?
[02:25:07.047 --> 02:25:15.889]  I think the reason is that they are going to ratchet up and into a new plan, a new mode of operation.
[02:25:15.889 --> 02:25:25.391]  And what they're going to do is, I mentioned earlier, there's 19 countries, major countries, that are in or close to bankruptcy.
[02:25:27.335 --> 02:25:38.198]  Maybe a year, a year and a half from now, two years, we're going to see the big meeting I described, the devaluation of currencies and so on.
[02:25:38.198 --> 02:25:42.120]  The Greece thing is a lead-in to that.
[02:25:42.120 --> 02:25:45.421]  This is to get the ball rolling in that direction.
[02:25:45.421 --> 02:25:52.583]  When they do that, when they finalize it with all of the nations, it'll affect the entire world.
[02:25:52.583 --> 02:25:55.244]  It'll be followed by a deflationary depression.
[02:25:56.690 --> 02:25:58.131]  And a war.
[02:25:58.131 --> 02:26:09.198]  And so what will happen is during that time frame, they will try to use all sorts of ways to implement world government.
[02:26:09.198 --> 02:26:12.240]  And that'll be their final thrust.
[02:26:12.240 --> 02:26:15.302]  And we've got to stop them before they get there.
[02:26:15.302 --> 02:26:23.968]  And by exposing what they're doing, and getting them to have to rush what they're doing, is going to put them off balance.
[02:26:23.968 --> 02:26:25.249]  They're going to make a lot of mistakes.
[02:26:25.911 --> 02:26:30.475]  We do have them confused, we got them on the run, and we are going to stop them.
[02:26:30.475 --> 02:26:32.736]  And one of the keys is the next election.
[02:26:32.736 --> 02:26:41.203]  If we can throw most of the incumbents out of office, irrespective of what party they're in, then we get a shot at it.
[02:26:41.203 --> 02:26:44.625]  If we get it, and it doesn't work, it doesn't work.
[02:26:44.625 --> 02:26:46.687]  But at least we tried.
[02:26:46.687 --> 02:26:50.670]  And that's the direction that we're headed in, and that's why Greece happened.
[02:26:50.670 --> 02:26:53.392]  And incidentally, I know for sure,
[02:26:54.045 --> 02:27:05.776]  That Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and other banks and major brokerage houses were all long the dollar between $74 and $76 on the USDX.
[02:27:05.776 --> 02:27:09.259]  It's trading up close to $81, $82 right now.
[02:27:09.259 --> 02:27:10.920]  And they knew what was going on.
[02:27:10.920 --> 02:27:13.543]  They had inside information.
[02:27:13.543 --> 02:27:15.585]  And of course, nothing will ever be done about it.
[02:27:16.224 --> 02:27:30.355]  And incidentally, at the same time, they shorted gold and silver in the forex, in the comics market, as well as the LBMA in London, and they also shorted the major gold stocks because we track all that stuff.
[02:27:30.355 --> 02:27:31.456]  But it's like a beach ball.
[02:27:31.456 --> 02:27:35.899]  They shove it down, it's going to pop right back up, and gold is starting to pop back up today.
[02:27:35.899 --> 02:27:37.901]  Where do you see it going?
[02:27:37.901 --> 02:27:42.044]  No, we'll go back up and test 1120, 1125, and if it gets through there, bingo, it's
[02:27:46.594 --> 02:27:52.137]  Retesting $12.24, $12.20, wherever that high was.
[02:27:52.137 --> 02:27:55.378]  Are you saying you believe that's going to happen soon?
[02:27:55.378 --> 02:27:56.659]  It could very well.
[02:27:56.659 --> 02:27:57.379]  It's hard to say.
[02:27:57.379 --> 02:27:58.960]  It all depends on what they do.
[02:27:58.960 --> 02:28:04.563]  We have the gold option contract, XPRI, behind us today and yesterday.
[02:28:04.563 --> 02:28:10.825]  So, the government is always going to come in with good derivatives into that bullion market, gold and silver.
[02:28:10.825 --> 02:28:16.128]  And they're going to continue to try to suppress that market from time to time.
[02:28:16.707 --> 02:28:23.672]  But they can't hold it down any more than three or four days at a time, and it pops right back up again, just like you just explained.
[02:28:23.672 --> 02:28:24.533]  All right.
[02:28:24.533 --> 02:28:28.135]  We're going to go to break in a moment, but let's get started now.
[02:28:28.135 --> 02:28:32.618]  Your boil down on the health care bill, I mean, it openly cuts Medicare and Medicaid.
[02:28:32.618 --> 02:28:34.760]  It doesn't cover pre-existing conditions.
[02:28:34.760 --> 02:28:36.561]  That's even in the Associated Press.
[02:28:36.561 --> 02:28:42.806]  Many members of Congress and the executive are selectively named to be exempt from it.
[02:28:42.806 --> 02:28:44.367]  It's totally unconstitutional.
[02:28:46.571 --> 02:28:48.432]  Why are they passing the health care?
[02:28:48.432 --> 02:28:53.576]  I mean, clearly the bank stocks are up, the insurance company stocks are up, they wrote the stinking thing.
[02:28:53.576 --> 02:28:58.439]  Your take on the health care takeover?
[02:28:58.439 --> 02:29:01.401]  First and foremost, it's people control.
[02:29:01.401 --> 02:29:05.244]  They can control your lives by controlling your medical care.
[02:29:05.244 --> 02:29:14.430]  And if you're Bob Chapman or Alex Jones, and you go and you have an appendicitis attack, and they're deciding whether to operate or not, they probably won't.
[02:29:16.055 --> 02:29:19.858]  And that's the reality down the road of what's going to happen.
[02:29:19.858 --> 02:29:22.960]  But it's people control.
[02:29:22.960 --> 02:29:25.622]  And when we come back, I've got a couple of things to add.
[02:29:25.622 --> 02:29:27.183]  We're going to come back and talk about it.
[02:29:27.183 --> 02:29:31.906]  And financially, it's a whole new tax system to the insurance companies.
[02:29:31.906 --> 02:29:35.049]  It's a bailout, as the media has called it, to the insurance company.
[02:29:35.049 --> 02:29:37.350]  It's not a bailout.
[02:29:37.350 --> 02:29:40.713]  It's a criminal consolidation.
[02:29:40.713 --> 02:29:41.813]  We'll talk about this more.
[02:29:41.813 --> 02:29:42.994]  Take your phone calls.
[02:29:42.994 --> 02:29:44.035]  Straight ahead, we'll be right back.
[02:29:46.963 --> 02:29:48.347]  We're on the march.
[02:29:48.347 --> 02:29:50.895]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:50.895 --> 02:29:53.584]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:57.668 --> 02:30:01.692]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:30:01.692 --> 02:30:04.935]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:30:04.935 --> 02:30:09.739]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:30:09.739 --> 02:30:16.125]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:30:16.125 --> 02:30:18.368]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:30:18.888 --> 02:30:19.188]  Tim Geithner?
[02:30:19.188 --> 02:30:19.709]  Bernanke?
[02:30:19.709 --> 02:30:20.509]  They're arsonists!
[02:30:20.509 --> 02:30:21.670]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:30:21.670 --> 02:30:23.912]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:30:37.802 --> 02:30:42.186]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[02:30:42.186 --> 02:30:45.069]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:30:45.069 --> 02:30:54.197]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:30:58.168 --> 02:31:02.129]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:02.129 --> 02:31:10.992]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:31:10.992 --> 02:31:15.613]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:31:15.613 --> 02:31:26.437]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:31:27.077 --> 02:31:36.580]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:36.580 --> 02:31:42.022]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:31:42.022 --> 02:31:49.505]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:49.505 --> 02:31:52.246]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:31:56.189 --> 02:31:57.490]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:31:57.490 --> 02:32:03.076]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:32:03.076 --> 02:32:08.101]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:32:08.101 --> 02:32:13.147]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:32:13.667 --> 02:32:18.888]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:32:18.888 --> 02:32:26.010]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:32:26.010 --> 02:32:27.130]  And here's the best part.
[02:32:27.130 --> 02:32:33.472]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:32:33.812 --> 02:32:36.995]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:32:36.995 --> 02:32:39.216]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:32:39.216 --> 02:32:40.157]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:32:40.157 --> 02:32:40.357]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:32:40.357 --> 02:32:43.800]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:32:43.800 --> 02:32:45.541]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:33:18.562 --> 02:33:24.764]  Everything is misdirection and deception with the corporate media.
[02:33:24.764 --> 02:33:31.166]  They create false debates about should we give free health care to children?
[02:33:31.166 --> 02:33:33.967]  Or is it wrong to be collectivist?
[02:33:33.967 --> 02:33:38.849]  When this is just the IRS, the private collection agency for the Federal Reserve,
[02:33:40.834 --> 02:33:50.348]  Getting into our lives, taking over our bank accounts, garnishing our wages, raising taxes on everybody, and lowering the standard of care for the insurance companies.
[02:33:50.348 --> 02:33:53.011]  That's why all their major stocks are way up right now.
[02:33:53.011 --> 02:33:54.814]  They wrote the bill.
[02:33:54.814 --> 02:33:56.737]  And if the public knew that, it would never have passed.
[02:33:57.796 --> 02:34:03.260]  The Democrats have this idea of wealth transfer and getting the rich people.
[02:34:03.260 --> 02:34:11.565]  If you can explain to these numbskulls that the big banks that own the insurance companies wrote this, we have a chance of defeating it in the future.
[02:34:11.565 --> 02:34:20.131]  But if we let the Republican Party handle it, you watch, they're going to keep almost all of it in place because the same insurance companies finance them.
[02:34:20.131 --> 02:34:26.075]  We have to start identifying the banking dictatorship openly being set up.
[02:34:26.075 --> 02:34:27.536]  There's no debate about this.
[02:34:28.196 --> 02:34:28.956]  And they have to.
[02:34:56.708 --> 02:35:00.531]  The point of no return was June of 2003.
[02:35:00.531 --> 02:35:05.614]  They got to go for it and they are going to lose no matter which way they go.
[02:35:05.614 --> 02:35:13.900]  And I think they're starting to realize this and you know in the olden days they used to banish them to another country that would take them.
[02:35:13.900 --> 02:35:16.542]  They're not going to have that luxury this time.
[02:35:16.542 --> 02:35:17.843]  The main things in that bill
[02:35:19.457 --> 02:35:25.062]  Which we've discussed here before in the program is the aspects of euthanasia.
[02:35:25.062 --> 02:35:32.069]  Of course, they didn't talk about that, but anybody with chronic diseases, they'll get rid of them or they won't treat them.
[02:35:32.069 --> 02:35:36.693]  And the old people who get ill, you know, they're going to give them an option.
[02:35:36.693 --> 02:35:41.177]  Do you want to die now or do we take your medicine away and you suffer for the next year and a half?
[02:35:42.845 --> 02:36:01.531]  Secondly, at the beginning of next year, the insurance will have to be covered for employees, and this is going to be devastating for small companies throughout America that produce 80% of all the jobs created in our country.
[02:36:01.531 --> 02:36:08.793]  And so, there's going to be a big jump in unemployment next year as these countries go
[02:36:09.713 --> 02:36:16.839]  Companies go out of business and their workers are thrown upon the unemployment rolls.
[02:36:16.839 --> 02:36:18.680]  And so that's another large factor.
[02:36:18.680 --> 02:36:24.124]  We don't have any clue of all the details that are in there yet.
[02:36:24.124 --> 02:36:26.847]  And we don't know what it's going to cost.
[02:36:26.847 --> 02:36:37.055]  Now, as I told you before, the treasury is having a heck of a time and has had for the last year or more selling their bonds.
[02:36:37.055 --> 02:36:37.215]  Now,
[02:36:38.126 --> 02:36:50.569]  The money that's going to come to finance this deficit spending for this medical bill is going to have to come from the Treasury, which is going to have to go out and ask people to buy their paper.
[02:36:50.569 --> 02:36:54.130]  And they're having a hard enough time now doing it.
[02:36:54.130 --> 02:36:57.871]  Now, that's why, and let me ask you a question here, Alex.
[02:36:57.871 --> 02:37:05.073]  Did you see the trial balloon that was set up yesterday in regard to the Service Employees Union?
[02:37:05.073 --> 02:37:05.553]  Yes, I did.
[02:37:07.054 --> 02:37:08.855]  And did you talk about it on the air?
[02:37:08.855 --> 02:37:21.859]  Of course, I don't listen to you because I'm doing all these other shows, but the point here is that they want to roll the pension plan of the people who are in the service union into the U.S.
[02:37:21.859 --> 02:37:28.841]  Treasury and get this guaranteed annuity that they would be offering.
[02:37:28.841 --> 02:37:35.403]  And so what they're doing here is breaking the ice toward funding the government
[02:37:36.109 --> 02:37:42.192]  With people's collateral or money and so that the government doesn't go bankrupt.
[02:37:42.192 --> 02:37:45.854]  Well Bob, let me stop you because this is really wild.
[02:37:45.854 --> 02:37:56.380]  You're not sitting here in studio, you're not watching us on PrisonPlanet.tv, you're on the phone with us and my next question was an article I've been covering for a week and a half.
[02:37:56.380 --> 02:38:02.664]  Failed banks may get pension fund backing as FDIC seeks cash Bloomberg and
[02:38:03.800 --> 02:38:12.844]  Next hour, because I want to go to some calls here in a few minutes, you're going to be with us for 20 minutes in the next hour, I want to start the next hour really detailing the point you just brought up.
[02:38:12.844 --> 02:38:20.967]  And I did see the union report, that was just piecemeal, how the unions think Obama's their sweetie pie and he wouldn't hurt them and he loves them.
[02:38:20.967 --> 02:38:23.308]  They don't know he's going to take them behind the shack and strangle them.
[02:38:23.308 --> 02:38:28.651]  You know, it's like a dog looking up at its master, not knowing the dog's about to be shot between the eyes.
[02:38:29.731 --> 02:38:39.815]  They calmly are saying private pension funds, government pension funds, state unions, teacher unions are going to be given to the banks.
[02:38:39.815 --> 02:38:51.119]  This is now being put out as a trial balloon very calmly and so they already stole 28 trillion with the banker takeover in the U.S.
[02:38:51.119 --> 02:38:55.041]  alone, 50 trillion worldwide total in the last year and a half and now
[02:38:56.308 --> 02:39:14.475]  They've already gotten to the point of saying, next we want your pension funds and they're telling, well you know two months ago the feds changed the regulations without even passing a law to say that your money markets, which are most savings accounts, aren't protected by the FDIC.
[02:39:14.475 --> 02:39:16.276]  So all the evidence is
[02:39:17.389 --> 02:39:32.896]  They are getting ready for some type of banking collapse, so next hour, I want to just give you the floor, after I read part of these articles on air, so people know this isn't just me saying this, so you can break down how you see this unfolding.
[02:39:32.896 --> 02:39:46.443]  But I do want to go to calls here in just a moment, but before we get into all the mechanics and the meat of this, Bob Chapman, specifically, what is the time frame for the collapse that you see?
[02:39:48.024 --> 02:39:49.624]  I think by the end of next year.
[02:39:49.624 --> 02:39:53.946]  Now, it's so hard to try to put a time on things.
[02:39:53.946 --> 02:39:57.507]  We discussed this before with Mr. Roberts.
[02:39:57.507 --> 02:39:59.147]  But it appears it's accelerating.
[02:39:59.147 --> 02:40:00.247]  It appears it's accelerating.
[02:40:00.247 --> 02:40:00.527]  It is.
[02:40:00.527 --> 02:40:01.928]  There's no question.
[02:40:01.928 --> 02:40:04.208]  And that's what Greece was all about.
[02:40:04.208 --> 02:40:08.169]  And of course, they made a fortune out of that by being long the dollar.
[02:40:08.169 --> 02:40:11.930]  And they weren't successful in shorting gold in the shares.
[02:40:11.930 --> 02:40:14.191]  But when we get to that,
[02:40:16.160 --> 02:40:30.292]  In the next hour, I have something to tell the audience that I've reported in the international forecast of this week and some of my contacts within the banking industry, one of whom attends Federal Reserve meetings.
[02:40:32.620 --> 02:40:39.822]  So, some powerful inside info coming up with Bob Chapman in T-minus 20 minutes.
[02:40:39.822 --> 02:40:49.205]  But right now, I wanted just for two or three minutes to bring Ted Anderson up, and then we're going to go to Tim, David, Bobby, Randy, Doug, and others that are holding.
[02:40:49.205 --> 02:40:52.426]  But I just want to make this point right now.
[02:40:52.426 --> 02:40:55.547]  When Bob says they've passed the point of no return,
[02:40:57.449 --> 02:41:14.132]  I think they passed it in 99 with the repeal of Glass-Steagall, but he's right in saying it took them an additional three and a half years to pump up the now 1.5 quadrillion mega derivatives bubble, thousands of times all the real assets in the world.
[02:41:14.132 --> 02:41:21.614]  They've created this Ponzi scheme so big that either they take over the world with it or they are destroyed.
[02:41:21.614 --> 02:41:23.094]  They, this is a,
[02:41:23.934 --> 02:41:26.476]  Win or lose proposition.
[02:41:26.476 --> 02:41:28.178]  All their chips are in.
[02:41:28.178 --> 02:41:30.399]  They have passed the point of no return.
[02:41:30.399 --> 02:41:32.381]  There's no backing off for them.
[02:41:32.381 --> 02:41:35.984]  This is an all or nothing situation.
[02:41:35.984 --> 02:41:40.147]  And so they're going to attach all the green taxes on the cities, counties, and states.
[02:41:40.147 --> 02:41:41.768]  They're going to pass the health care bills.
[02:41:41.768 --> 02:41:43.650]  They're going to raise other taxes.
[02:41:43.650 --> 02:41:44.651]  They're going to attempt
[02:41:45.031 --> 02:41:54.924]  Total amnesty, overrun the country, let the illegals vote as a political weapon against whoever's left in the nation who can still, you know, rub two brain cells together.
[02:41:54.924 --> 02:41:56.866]  So it's all coming down now.
[02:41:56.866 --> 02:42:02.854]  This is the final battle, the next five years or so, and it's going to be staged terror attacks, new wars.
[02:42:04.135 --> 02:42:06.717]  They're going to be arresting citizens and torturing them.
[02:42:06.717 --> 02:42:08.337]  They've got bills to openly do it.
[02:42:08.337 --> 02:42:11.439]  I had Judge Napolitano on yesterday documenting that.
[02:42:11.439 --> 02:42:15.241]  This is so unspeakable what is going on.
[02:42:15.241 --> 02:42:18.943]  I want to bring Ted up here briefly because gold's back up.
[02:42:18.943 --> 02:42:25.486]  Ted still has gold from the $1,050 level, with it above $1,100 right now, or right up there.
[02:42:25.486 --> 02:42:28.928]  And you get a free international forecast, either hard copy or digital version.
[02:42:29.688 --> 02:42:39.937]  When you do this, and it's invaluable info, plus you get a franc, a European franc, a fifth of an ounce gold coin, at a price no one else anywhere can offer.
[02:42:39.937 --> 02:42:46.724]  I've seen no deals this good, and yeah, this is our sponsor, it funds the operation, but I also believe in it, and
[02:42:48.067 --> 02:42:50.930]  I want my listeners to be positioned.
[02:42:50.930 --> 02:42:55.074]  It's not a silver bullet, but silver and gold is the closest thing to it.
[02:42:55.074 --> 02:43:05.965]  You need to start getting out, at least partially, out of paper money and paper assets, because these made-off people, these Kinley types that are running things,
[02:43:06.991 --> 02:43:16.819]  This is how they get you so desperate, so set up in the system, that every new crisis they say, well, your 401k is going down, we gotta raise taxes, but this'll pump it back up.
[02:43:16.819 --> 02:43:19.421]  And then you lose a lot, but you get some of it back.
[02:43:19.421 --> 02:43:22.963]  And then they take even more, and then they give you some back.
[02:43:22.963 --> 02:43:25.465]  This is the whole slave mindset.
[02:43:25.465 --> 02:43:30.069]  Ted Anderson, briefly tell folks about today's awesome offers.
[02:43:30.831 --> 02:43:38.158]  Well, Alex, the one that you touched on, the franc at 261.61, you're going to get a Swiss-French franc.
[02:43:38.158 --> 02:43:39.419]  It's European.
[02:43:39.419 --> 02:43:41.401]  It's a fifth of an ounce of gold.
[02:43:41.401 --> 02:43:44.905]  And you're going to get a subscription to the International Forecaster.
[02:43:44.905 --> 02:43:45.846]  That goes for $159.
[02:43:45.846 --> 02:43:52.632]  And when you consider the discount, because you're getting that subscription, it brings gold all the way down to $520 an ounce.
[02:43:54.693 --> 02:43:57.495]  So try to get that anywhere else in the marketplace.
[02:43:57.495 --> 02:43:59.236]  Obviously, it's a great buy.
[02:43:59.236 --> 02:44:02.538]  Say, the Montana Silvers have completely sold out.
[02:44:02.538 --> 02:44:06.221]  They're manufacturing me more, but you can't get them anywhere right now.
[02:44:06.221 --> 02:44:10.303]  But they came up with a coin that was really interesting that I do have right now.
[02:44:10.303 --> 02:44:14.646]  That's the Silver Sovereign 1oz, 1⁄2oz, 1⁄4oz.
[02:44:14.646 --> 02:44:17.188]  And they even make a coin that's as small as 1⁄10oz.
[02:44:17.188 --> 02:44:24.433]  Now, if you want to see those coins, you can go to one of our offers on Infowars.com and just click on one of the Midas links.
[02:44:24.873 --> 02:44:26.494]  It'll take you right to it.
[02:44:26.494 --> 02:44:28.896]  But it is just an interesting thing.
[02:44:28.896 --> 02:44:29.676]  Beautiful coin.
[02:44:29.676 --> 02:44:33.879]  Again, it's all about sovereignty of that Montana organization over there.
[02:44:33.879 --> 02:44:36.380]  I love the Montana silver coins.
[02:44:36.380 --> 02:44:38.282]  I really love this coin as well.
[02:44:38.282 --> 02:44:40.303]  I think it's a great coin to be getting into.
[02:44:40.303 --> 02:44:41.464]  Gold is up.
[02:44:41.464 --> 02:44:43.145]  Gold went up $13.60 today.
[02:44:43.145 --> 02:44:47.547]  Seen a high today of $1,007.
[02:44:47.547 --> 02:44:48.688]  So yeah, it's strong.
[02:44:48.688 --> 02:44:53.051]  And it's no doubt that gold is going to be doing well because, unfortunately, our
[02:44:53.697 --> 02:44:58.001]  Political environment is destroying the United States currency.
[02:44:58.001 --> 02:45:01.844]  Ted, to be specific, what is gold's exact price right now?
[02:45:01.844 --> 02:45:07.408]  Right now, gold is currently at $1,105.60.
[02:45:07.408 --> 02:45:08.649]  Presently.
[02:45:08.649 --> 02:45:12.873]  Okay, so it's gone up quite a bit in a few days, despite the fact that they tried to drive it down.
[02:45:12.873 --> 02:45:14.274]  Folks, here's the toll-free number.
[02:45:14.274 --> 02:45:14.714]  800-686-2237.
[02:45:14.714 --> 02:45:14.774]  800-686-2237.
[02:45:14.774 --> 02:45:16.255]  And when it's the Alex Jones Special,
[02:45:23.402 --> 02:45:31.448]  All you've got to do is tell them it's Alex Jones Special, and then whatever coins, and they have a whole lot of other offers they've got, you will get a special discount.
[02:45:31.448 --> 02:45:31.868]  800-686-2237.
[02:45:31.868 --> 02:45:34.690]  800-686-2237.
[02:45:34.690 --> 02:45:38.673]  Thank you, Ted Anderson.
[02:45:38.673 --> 02:45:40.175]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[02:45:40.175 --> 02:45:40.735]  You bet.
[02:45:40.735 --> 02:45:44.718]  Again, that number, 800-686-2237.
[02:45:44.718 --> 02:45:46.779]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Tim in Ohio.
[02:45:46.779 --> 02:45:47.840]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[02:45:47.840 --> 02:45:49.061]  Go ahead, Tim.
[02:45:49.061 --> 02:45:49.682]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[02:45:51.042 --> 02:45:55.884]  Three brief statements concerning this pre-Soylent Green statement that we're in and a quick question for Bob.
[02:45:55.884 --> 02:46:02.086]  Number one semantics, Alex, Sotoro, Sotoro, Sotoro, put a big sign in front of your microphone.
[02:46:02.086 --> 02:46:20.232]  I keep calling him Barack Obama, we must all change and say our fraudulent president, Barry Sotoro, Indonesian citizen, not even a birth certificate issue, he is an Indonesian citizen, was adopted there, he is a fraud, Barry Sotoro, aka Barack Obama.
[02:46:20.649 --> 02:46:28.360]  I've been putting signs up all over my town that say, Wanted for Treason, Barry Sotoro, aka Barack Obama, and the Barack, well, Obamacrimes.com.
[02:46:29.321 --> 02:46:34.704]  By the way, we're coming out with a Barry Sotaro t-shirt that has a picture of A.K.A.
[02:46:34.704 --> 02:46:40.727]  Barack Obama on it, so that'll be a hot way to get the... He'll say, Barry Sotaro, that's Obama!
[02:46:40.727 --> 02:46:46.170]  You'll be able to... And listen, they can't stop the people as a protest to health care to tell the truth about him.
[02:46:46.170 --> 02:46:53.134]  The idea of everyone calling him Barry Sotaro and the way it opens up discussions and talk, this can bring him down.
[02:46:53.134 --> 02:46:58.177]  He's a figurehead, but if we can get him to basically end up going to prison for...
[02:46:58.797 --> 02:47:08.145]  What about all the congressmen, ISSA and others, will call for special prosecutor to investigate White House bribery, quid quo pro.
[02:47:08.145 --> 02:47:13.229]  We know this is illegal, how they got these votes, Bob Chapman.
[02:47:13.229 --> 02:47:14.190]  Oh, that's right.
[02:47:14.190 --> 02:47:16.591]  And we will be able to do something about it.
[02:47:16.591 --> 02:47:22.957]  Our time will come.
[02:47:22.957 --> 02:47:23.757]  Well said, Bob.
[02:47:23.757 --> 02:47:24.418]  Anything else, Tim?
[02:47:25.154 --> 02:47:27.435]  Yes, uh, let's go back to the semantics real quick.
[02:47:27.435 --> 02:47:28.396]  Look at what you're dealing with.
[02:47:28.396 --> 02:47:29.176]  Politics.
[02:47:29.176 --> 02:47:29.936]  Poly.
[02:47:29.936 --> 02:47:30.717]  Many.
[02:47:30.717 --> 02:47:31.617]  Ticks.
[02:47:31.617 --> 02:47:33.678]  Blood-sucking creatures.
[02:47:33.678 --> 02:47:35.019]  Wake up, people.
[02:47:35.019 --> 02:47:36.379]  Also with the census.
[02:47:36.379 --> 02:47:39.381]  All the census are addressed to resident.
[02:47:39.381 --> 02:47:41.922]  What is a res in Latin root words, but property.
[02:47:42.648 --> 02:47:43.769]  Res means property.
[02:47:43.769 --> 02:47:45.110]  Ident means identify.
[02:47:45.110 --> 02:47:46.491]  Don't identify yourself.
[02:47:46.491 --> 02:47:50.453]  Look at how they call your employees human resources.
[02:47:50.453 --> 02:47:51.874]  We are resources of the elite.
[02:47:51.874 --> 02:47:53.515]  Tim, I appreciate your call.
[02:47:53.515 --> 02:47:55.897]  Bob, any comments on what Tim was saying?
[02:47:55.897 --> 02:47:59.179]  He's right on the ball, that's for sure.
[02:47:59.179 --> 02:48:00.740]  David in Washington, you're on the air.
[02:48:00.740 --> 02:48:02.261]  Go ahead.
[02:48:02.261 --> 02:48:04.102]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:48:04.102 --> 02:48:05.723]  First time caller.
[02:48:05.723 --> 02:48:09.346]  My wife and I pray for you and your family every day.
[02:48:09.346 --> 02:48:09.686]  Thank you.
[02:48:11.172 --> 02:48:16.773]  I've got three quick observations and a talking point.
[02:48:16.773 --> 02:48:32.377]  The listeners need, as we're getting into this, we need constructive solutions besides the videos and talking points and how to organize locally and communicate with people in your immediate area.
[02:48:32.773 --> 02:48:42.046]  Well David, that's all we've been doing, and we're going to get Red Beckman on next week, specifically about how to get grand juries to start criminal proceedings.
[02:48:42.046 --> 02:48:49.076]  And Judge Napolitano, I've been calling for that all week, he separately said that's the way to go, have the states pass nullification laws.
[02:48:50.257 --> 02:48:55.360]  Call all your state reps, run for state rep, point out how this is illegal.
[02:48:55.360 --> 02:49:01.002]  The reason we say books and videos is the general public is still caught up in the left-right paradigm to a certain extent.
[02:49:01.002 --> 02:49:06.445]  We've got to unlock them from that to start realizing that puppets come and go, the bankers are the enemy.
[02:49:06.445 --> 02:49:08.566]  Bob Chapman.
[02:49:08.566 --> 02:49:17.050]  There's no question about that and they are the core nucleus, the nexus behind the scenes that are controlling everything.
[02:49:17.811 --> 02:49:21.553]  And, of course, there's a lot of other people besides bankers who are involved.
[02:49:21.553 --> 02:49:28.778]  Wall Street insurance, transnational corporations, the black nobility of Europe who really run things from behind the scenes.
[02:49:28.778 --> 02:49:36.363]  And so, we've got to bring that to the attention so people understand how this happened, how it evolved, and where we think it's going.
[02:49:36.363 --> 02:49:37.464]  David, you've got about a minute.
[02:49:37.464 --> 02:49:38.464]  Finish up.
[02:49:38.464 --> 02:49:40.185]  Really quick.
[02:49:40.185 --> 02:49:45.869]  I'm concerned about your safety and contingency plans if they do shut you down.
[02:49:47.043 --> 02:49:58.305]  And I'd like to have some way, maybe talk with your staff about contacting you if I come into any ability to help you significantly.
[02:49:58.305 --> 02:50:08.067]  And I think that the situation in Fairbanks, Alaska needs some exposure.
[02:50:08.067 --> 02:50:10.167]  But my talking point is this.
[02:50:10.167 --> 02:50:11.248]  I'll try it really quick.
[02:50:11.248 --> 02:50:12.468]  150 years, we've been
[02:50:14.651 --> 02:50:22.396]  Laboring under this delusion amongst the Christians about a rapture that's going to take them off to heaven.
[02:50:22.396 --> 02:50:27.800]  And the whole thing has put the whole Christian community, how many are there?
[02:50:27.800 --> 02:50:29.581]  45 million of them, to sleep.
[02:50:30.831 --> 02:50:36.313]  The whole, uh, I know this isn't a religious program, but... No, but you're right.
[02:50:36.313 --> 02:50:48.716]  The Rockefellers funded it so that everybody thinks they're going to be raptured so they don't have to fight evil, and it's a giant cop-out because it was Christians that founded this country and stood up to tyranny, and you made a really good point.
[02:50:48.716 --> 02:50:52.718]  More calls straight ahead, and you can always contact us by email, David.
[02:50:52.718 --> 02:50:53.438]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:53.438 --> 02:50:53.818]  Stay with us.
[02:50:56.741 --> 02:50:58.522]  Great news for pure water lovers!

[02:51:58.219 --> 02:52:02.242]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:02.242 --> 02:52:05.484]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:05.484 --> 02:52:06.905]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:52:07.617 --> 02:52:10.298]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:10.298 --> 02:52:16.680]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:16.680 --> 02:52:22.222]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:22.222 --> 02:52:31.846]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:31.966 --> 02:52:34.307]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:34.307 --> 02:52:35.908]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:35.908 --> 02:52:38.369]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:38.369 --> 02:52:40.490]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:40.490 --> 02:52:45.632]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:45.632 --> 02:52:54.756]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:52:57.168 --> 02:53:00.709]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:53:00.709 --> 02:53:02.990]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:53:02.990 --> 02:53:03.870]  Don't!
[02:53:03.870 --> 02:53:07.291]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[02:53:07.291 --> 02:53:14.413]  Why pay, when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[02:53:14.393 --> 02:53:16.374]  's number one debt secret.
[02:53:16.374 --> 02:53:20.455]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[02:53:20.455 --> 02:53:23.156]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[02:53:23.596 --> 02:53:30.962]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[02:53:30.962 --> 02:53:32.163]  Herb K was right.
[02:53:32.163 --> 02:53:35.366]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[02:53:35.366 --> 02:53:36.787]  What have you got to lose?
[02:53:36.787 --> 02:53:38.068]  Stop the calls now.
[02:53:38.068 --> 02:53:40.090]  Get out of debt and have more money.
[02:53:40.090 --> 02:53:43.993]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now.

[02:53:44.634 --> 02:53:44.814]  That's 800-822-1291.
[02:53:52.420 --> 02:54:10.234]  800-822-1291 No, they divide us along the lines of Republicans and Democrats.
[02:54:10.234 --> 02:54:14.437]  They tell us the debate is about, should we be socialist and give free health care to poor people?
[02:54:16.670 --> 02:54:20.332]  But what socialists don't understand is, it's always robbed.
[02:54:20.332 --> 02:54:27.477]  The banks, the British Empire, created socialism as a way to con the serfs back into slavery.
[02:54:27.477 --> 02:54:28.957]  We have their internal documents.
[02:54:28.957 --> 02:54:30.538]  We have Tragedy and Hope.
[02:54:30.538 --> 02:54:33.540]  We have the CFR, the UN, pushing it.
[02:54:33.540 --> 02:54:38.383]  They're openly announcing a global banking takeover that you'll pay all your taxes to.
[02:54:38.383 --> 02:54:40.545]  We're 100% right here.
[02:54:40.545 --> 02:54:42.566]  We know what we're talking about.
[02:54:42.566 --> 02:54:43.746]  This is all we do!
[02:54:44.847 --> 02:54:48.471]  There's no more time to screw around with these people!
[02:54:48.471 --> 02:54:51.314]  They funded Hitler, Stalin, and Mao!
[02:54:51.314 --> 02:54:54.317]  They want control, and they love to slaughter the entire middle class.
[02:54:54.317 --> 02:54:56.439]  40 plus million in Russia.
[02:54:56.439 --> 02:54:57.420]  60 plus million in China.
[02:54:57.420 --> 02:54:59.042]  20 plus million in Germany.
[02:54:59.042 --> 02:55:02.846]  3 million, or 30% of the population in Cambodia.
[02:55:02.846 --> 02:55:05.548]  And Zbigniew Brzezinski writes books about it, bragging how the U.S.
[02:55:05.548 --> 02:55:06.830]  funded the whole stinking thing.
[02:55:09.673 --> 02:55:15.416]  You think they'll kill a million-plus Iraqis for some oil and weapons sales and that your life means anything to them?
[02:55:15.416 --> 02:55:20.478]  You better grow up, all you slobs out there!
[02:55:20.478 --> 02:55:22.499]  I'm talking about fake right-wingers and left-wingers.
[02:55:22.499 --> 02:55:24.800]  You people are living on another planet, okay?
[02:55:24.800 --> 02:55:25.840]  I'm living on the real planet.
[02:55:25.840 --> 02:55:27.261]  I'm sorry I'm ranting.
[02:55:27.261 --> 02:55:31.263]  I was just reading how they are going to take the 401Ks next and it's all being announced.
[02:55:31.263 --> 02:55:32.643]  In fact, I don't want just the articles.
[02:55:32.643 --> 02:55:38.086]  Will you try to... YouTube, Obama talks about
[02:55:39.110 --> 02:55:40.911]  Putting 401ks into treasuries.
[02:55:40.911 --> 02:55:45.774]  Now, we know they were proposing this a few months ago and Bob and I warned you.
[02:55:45.774 --> 02:55:49.237]  Bob, it's one thing to know it's coming, it's another thing to see them doing it.
[02:55:49.237 --> 02:55:52.699]  It's another thing to see them all over the news saying, shut down free speech.
[02:55:52.699 --> 02:55:58.903]  I know you don't get angry, you're way past that, but it's not even anger with me, I'm just sick of it.
[02:55:58.903 --> 02:56:01.525]  Why do we have to let this happen, Bob Chapman?
[02:56:01.525 --> 02:56:02.606]  Why is the public
[02:56:03.655 --> 02:56:05.336]  Why aren't there more people like us?
[02:56:05.336 --> 02:56:07.278]  I don't think I'm some special person.
[02:56:07.278 --> 02:56:08.919]  I don't want to be a slave!
[02:56:08.919 --> 02:56:17.726]  I mean, what red-blooded man can let their family go into bondage to a bunch of stinking, chicken-necked bankers?
[02:56:17.726 --> 02:56:19.947]  It's human nature.
[02:56:19.947 --> 02:56:22.509]  It's the easy way out.
[02:56:22.509 --> 02:56:28.073]  And then when they get there, to the stage that we're taking them, then they go into a denial.
[02:56:28.073 --> 02:56:30.275]  And we have to go through that process as well.
[02:56:30.993 --> 02:56:38.396]  And then all of a sudden, one day, their house is foreclosed on and their job is gone.
[02:56:38.396 --> 02:56:39.297]  They don't have anything.
[02:56:39.297 --> 02:56:40.737]  They're in the streets.
[02:56:40.737 --> 02:56:48.601]  And the only thing the guy's got left is his AR-15 and ten 30-shot clips ready to go.
[02:56:48.601 --> 02:56:52.042]  And that probably is the way it's going to end up.
[02:56:52.042 --> 02:56:53.563]  And we know who he's going to go after.
[02:56:53.563 --> 02:56:58.145]  Because he's going to call up Alex and say, who are the bad guys?
[02:56:58.145 --> 02:56:59.646]  And Alex is going to send him a list.
[02:57:01.621 --> 02:57:05.823]  Bob, I am not going to send him a list.
[02:57:05.823 --> 02:57:08.583]  I just thought I'd pull your tail on that one.
[02:57:08.583 --> 02:57:13.685]  But the thing is, that is the process that people are going through right now.
[02:57:13.685 --> 02:57:21.068]  And people who have been financially mostly injured, they're starting to perk up and they're listening.
[02:57:21.884 --> 02:57:28.866]  And there's a lot of people who are graduating into that, and they're going to talk to other people.
[02:57:28.866 --> 02:57:36.588]  And it's going to start to swell over the next couple of years, while all of this that we've discussed earlier is coming down.
[02:57:36.588 --> 02:57:38.689]  And there will be action.
[02:57:38.689 --> 02:57:41.730]  We don't know exactly what form it's going to take.
[02:57:41.730 --> 02:57:47.112]  Maybe the state legislatures will step in and save us, so to speak.
[02:57:47.112 --> 02:57:48.272]  We don't know.
[02:57:48.272 --> 02:57:51.373]  All we can do is give the information to the people,
[02:57:52.173 --> 02:58:00.595]  As quickly and as best we can through your program, other programs like it, and also of course the internet.
[02:58:00.595 --> 02:58:03.776]  Well Bob, let me throw this out there as we go to break to put a bookend on this.
[02:58:03.776 --> 02:58:06.837]  We're going to come back and take a few more calls in the next segment after that.
[02:58:06.837 --> 02:58:09.318]  Get into the key news you were just talking about.
[02:58:09.318 --> 02:58:11.899]  I am for non-violence offensively.
[02:58:11.899 --> 02:58:13.779]  I believe we should be able to protect ourselves.
[02:58:13.779 --> 02:58:14.819]  This is tyranny.
[02:58:14.819 --> 02:58:17.320]  Our forefathers revolted against much less.
[02:58:17.320 --> 02:58:19.661]  But the system is pushing and wants violence.
[02:58:20.715 --> 02:58:23.536]  At this juncture.
[02:58:23.536 --> 02:58:27.718]  But this isn't Argentina or other countries they've taken over.
[02:58:27.718 --> 02:58:35.622]  We do have 150 million gun owners and it is not going to go well for the establishment no matter how many black ski mask goons they employ.
[02:58:35.622 --> 02:58:41.825]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:41.825 --> 02:58:43.885]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:47.233 --> 02:58:50.234]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:58:50.234 --> 02:58:55.556]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:58:55.556 --> 02:58:57.616]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:58:57.616 --> 02:59:02.618]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:59:02.618 --> 02:59:03.798]  How much do you want?
[02:59:03.798 --> 02:59:04.919]  When do you want it?
[02:59:04.919 --> 02:59:06.799]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:59:06.799 --> 02:59:07.879]  When will you need it?
[02:59:07.879 --> 02:59:10.080]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:59:10.080 --> 02:59:11.421]  Will there be any food?
[02:59:11.421 --> 02:59:12.721]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:59:12.941 --> 02:59:18.207]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:59:18.207 --> 02:59:21.791]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:59:21.791 --> 02:59:25.616]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:59:25.616 --> 02:59:26.857]  How much will you need?
[02:59:26.857 --> 02:59:27.758]  We don't know.
[02:59:27.758 --> 02:59:28.860]  How much do you want?
[02:59:28.860 --> 02:59:29.781]  All you can get.
[02:59:29.781 --> 02:59:30.602]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:59:30.862 --> 02:59:33.904]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:59:33.904 --> 02:59:36.125]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:36.125 --> 02:59:37.126]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:00:01.168 --> 03:00:09.875]  Well, it's already the fourth and final hour of this 26th day of March 2010, a Friday edition.
[03:00:09.875 --> 03:00:13.078]  Bob Chapman with us for another 20 minutes, TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[03:00:13.078 --> 03:00:17.421]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:00:17.421 --> 03:00:21.785]  And we're going to go to a few more of your phone calls here in a moment.
[03:00:21.785 --> 03:00:25.988]  And when Bob leaves us, I will continue with phone calls and recap a lot of news and cover some news.
[03:00:25.988 --> 03:00:29.190]  I've got three stacks of it here that I haven't even gotten to yet.
[03:00:30.307 --> 03:00:36.828]  But Bob was bringing up the point, basically, that the system isn't going to have to stage terror attacks.
[03:00:36.828 --> 03:00:39.449]  Anybody resisting is being called terrorism.
[03:00:39.449 --> 03:00:41.329]  It's going to happen spontaneously.
[03:00:41.329 --> 03:00:45.930]  And that's why FEMA teaches that the founding fathers were terrorists.
[03:00:45.930 --> 03:00:48.810]  I believe that whoever fires first loses.
[03:00:48.810 --> 03:00:51.711]  I believe we have a lot of legislative avenues in the states.
[03:00:51.711 --> 03:00:53.651]  I know people are waking up.
[03:00:53.651 --> 03:00:56.192]  Eighty percent against the health bill, they still passed it.
[03:00:56.192 --> 03:00:57.872]  They're trying amnesty, cap and trade.
[03:00:58.692 --> 03:01:03.596]  We have a lot of things to exhaust here before things go to the cartridge box.
[03:01:03.596 --> 03:01:09.421]  And it's not just the ballot box, it's lawsuits, it's criminal charges, it's special prosecutors.
[03:01:09.421 --> 03:01:14.144]  Bob Chapman, do you agree with me that whoever fires first loses?
[03:01:14.144 --> 03:01:15.646]  Absolutely.
[03:01:15.646 --> 03:01:26.254]  And you know, the point I was trying to make there is that you're going to have disgruntled people, deeply disgruntled, because they don't know how to handle what's happened to them.
[03:01:27.817 --> 03:01:39.149]  What they have to do is suppress their desire, their feeling for revenge by not acting unless they're shot at or something.
[03:01:39.149 --> 03:01:48.358]  They've got to use the avenues that are available to us, and Alex comes up with these ideas, and so don't the legislatures.
[03:01:49.113 --> 03:01:51.055]  Those are, that's the road to follow.
[03:01:51.055 --> 03:01:58.680]  We're a long way for anything like that happening, except perhaps for isolated incidents here and there.
[03:01:58.680 --> 03:02:01.422]  So, what I'm saying here is you stay out of trouble.
[03:02:01.422 --> 03:02:02.783]  But it is a big checkmate!
[03:02:03.868 --> 03:02:11.872]  But it is a big checkmate on the system, Bob, that there are 150 million gun owners, 400 million guns, and that people can't be pushed too far.
[03:02:11.872 --> 03:02:16.774]  So that's why they built up this huge internal security police force.
[03:02:16.774 --> 03:02:20.736]  That's why they're trying to pass bills to openly torture U.S.
[03:02:20.736 --> 03:02:26.518]  citizens, it says, and enhance interrogation for no reason, for any intelligence purposes they wish.
[03:02:26.518 --> 03:02:27.919]  In fact, I want to go back over that bill.
[03:02:27.919 --> 03:02:30.280]  I know you print it every day and it's moved off the stack.
[03:02:30.280 --> 03:02:31.841]  Print it one more time, Jaren, thank you.
[03:02:32.501 --> 03:02:36.122]  It's a joke around here that he may print articles ten times in one week.
[03:02:36.122 --> 03:02:39.983]  But it isn't going to work.
[03:02:39.983 --> 03:02:44.224]  And these guys in their ivory towers think they're going to bring some type of Soviet tyranny here.
[03:02:44.224 --> 03:02:48.385]  And the question is, did the Russians have the right to resist Stalin?
[03:02:48.385 --> 03:02:50.446]  Did the Germans?
[03:02:50.446 --> 03:02:53.547]  I mean, was it wrong that Germans tried to resist Hitler?
[03:02:53.547 --> 03:02:56.328]  Was it wrong that Chinese tried to resist Mao?
[03:02:56.328 --> 03:02:59.589]  And according to our government, yes, you must worship government.
[03:02:59.589 --> 03:03:00.909]  Government is always right, Bob.
[03:03:02.572 --> 03:03:10.035]  And that's what they want us to believe, and the tyranny hasn't reached that point yet.
[03:03:10.035 --> 03:03:20.520]  In Germany, they were just really lulled to sleep because, you know, they were in a depression and they needed help, and this guy, Hitler, he sounded like maybe he could do something.
[03:03:20.520 --> 03:03:23.961]  And he really did capture their imagination and their votes as well.
[03:03:25.372 --> 03:03:27.513]  In Russia, it was a different situation.
[03:03:27.513 --> 03:03:29.174]  The government was overthrown.
[03:03:29.174 --> 03:03:34.578]  The first thing they did was a purge, and then they had another purge in 1937 to 1939.
[03:03:34.578 --> 03:03:41.302]  The officer corps, if you may, and of course they killed hundreds of millions of people.
[03:03:41.302 --> 03:03:42.443]  You don't hear much about it.
[03:03:42.443 --> 03:03:47.647]  You hear about what Hitler did, but the Russians were even, well, the Russian communists were even worse.
[03:03:49.497 --> 03:03:51.058]  You know, that's a point we need to make.
[03:03:51.058 --> 03:04:00.885]  In every case in history, once a corrupt group really overthrows a government and starts looting, the first group they go after isn't even the political dissidents.
[03:04:00.885 --> 03:04:03.507]  They just isolate and ignore them generally.
[03:04:03.507 --> 03:04:06.890]  They go after people who know where the bodies are buried.
[03:04:06.890 --> 03:04:11.093]  They go after the people that brought them to power.
[03:04:11.093 --> 03:04:14.135]  Absolutely, because they can't have them around putting the finger on them.
[03:04:16.127 --> 03:04:20.313]  All right, Bob, we're going to come back with the key to all this.
[03:04:20.313 --> 03:04:31.409]  The fact that the banks have now looted you with the takeover of health care, trying to loot you with the carbon taxes, raising all these taxes as the economy literally implodes in on itself.
[03:04:32.170 --> 03:04:36.152]  And they're now saying they're going to take the pension funds and 401ks.
[03:04:36.152 --> 03:04:48.396]  It's mainstream news being reported, but they're talking about, oh, there might be light showers this afternoon, or, oh, they're having a beagle race down at the park today.
[03:04:48.396 --> 03:04:52.538]  But they're announcing, it's like announcing space aliens landed calmly.
[03:04:54.591 --> 03:04:59.937]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[03:04:59.937 --> 03:05:02.680]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[03:05:02.680 --> 03:05:07.065]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[03:05:09.428 --> 03:05:12.490]  Order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.
[03:05:12.490 --> 03:05:17.514]  We also have some specials where you can get some of our other films half price when you order Shadow Government.

[03:05:28.663 --> 03:05:30.525]  This film needs to be seen.
[03:05:30.525 --> 03:05:31.666]  Everybody needs to get it.

[03:05:54.500 --> 03:05:55.801]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:05:55.801 --> 03:06:01.406]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:06:01.406 --> 03:06:06.410]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:06:06.410 --> 03:06:11.455]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[03:06:11.975 --> 03:06:17.219]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:06:17.219 --> 03:06:24.323]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:06:24.323 --> 03:06:25.444]  And here's the best part.
[03:06:25.444 --> 03:06:31.808]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[03:06:38.471 --> 03:06:38.671]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:06:38.671 --> 03:06:42.112]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:06:42.112 --> 03:06:43.853]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:06:55.014 --> 03:06:57.015]  Man, are you urinating more frequently?
[03:06:57.015 --> 03:06:58.536]  Do you wake up to urinate?
[03:06:58.536 --> 03:07:00.377]  Don't ignore your prostate health.

[03:07:50.643 --> 03:07:58.228]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:07:58.228 --> 03:08:01.710]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:01.710 --> 03:08:10.795]  If you just now joined us, drop what you're doing.
[03:08:10.795 --> 03:08:12.916]  If you're pulling through a Starbucks listening to us on XM,
[03:08:15.307 --> 03:08:21.190]  Pull over, listen, don't halfway listen, and get your double latte.
[03:08:21.190 --> 03:08:23.111]  Okay?
[03:08:23.111 --> 03:08:32.636]  Five years ago, George Bush and the Democrats together changed the federal regulations where private companies could take your pension funds.
[03:08:32.636 --> 03:08:34.617]  You saw what happened with Enron.
[03:08:35.765 --> 03:08:48.657]  You saw what happened with Global Crossing and scores of other companies where they're shell companies, they move the real assets out into other companies, and then they steal your pension funds and maybe pay you 5, 10 cents on the dollar.
[03:08:48.657 --> 03:08:53.041]  In the case of Enron, thousands and thousands of employees got nothing.
[03:08:53.041 --> 03:08:56.524]  Now, how do we always know what's going to happen?
[03:08:56.524 --> 03:08:58.005]  We're going to Bob Chapman in a moment.
[03:08:58.005 --> 03:08:59.827]  How do we always call it like it is?
[03:09:01.024 --> 03:09:15.456]  Because the same private IMF World Bank holding companies, the Federal Reserve's another arm of that, partners with the Bank of England, these are front companies, receivership arms, holding companies, for the private central banks.
[03:09:15.456 --> 03:09:24.183]  Openly announcing world government, Bank of the World, no more denial, global constitution, they rule our countries illegitimately, they're making agreements with each other right now.
[03:09:24.183 --> 03:09:28.386]  They've engineered a financial implosion so big, that's meant to give them total power,
[03:09:29.267 --> 03:09:31.350]  If they fail, they're destroyed in the process.
[03:09:31.350 --> 03:09:33.713]  So, this is an all-or-nothing exercise.
[03:09:33.713 --> 03:09:34.674]  I keep saying that.
[03:09:34.674 --> 03:09:38.138]  All-or-nothing for them, all-or-nothing for us.
[03:09:38.138 --> 03:09:47.590]  That's why they're announcing censorship of the web, the Fairness Doctrine, all these new taxes, IRS running your healthcare, taking your wages, carbon taxes even if the Senate won't pass it.
[03:09:47.970 --> 03:09:52.693]  They've got to get the money, and the big banks authored the insurance takeover.
[03:09:52.693 --> 03:09:55.014]  That's what conservative talk show hosts won't tell you.
[03:09:55.014 --> 03:09:59.676]  They'll say it's a bunch of communist liberals, you know, that just want to give poor people health care.
[03:09:59.676 --> 03:10:05.139]  No, they want to run your life, and they want to cut Medicare and Medicaid while raising taxes to pay the banks.
[03:10:05.139 --> 03:10:13.264]  We've seen the IMF and World Bank, the Ex-Im Bank, and these other consortiums in hundreds of nations, and sometimes over and over and over again.
[03:10:13.264 --> 03:10:16.626]  Argentina, Nigeria, Greece, Iceland, the list goes on and on.
[03:10:17.526 --> 03:10:19.528]  We're good to go.
[03:10:36.960 --> 03:10:38.521]  Taken from the private central banks.
[03:10:38.521 --> 03:10:39.581]  They get the world for nothing.
[03:10:39.581 --> 03:10:48.525]  As Thomas Jefferson said, if you ever let private banks to control the issuance of currency and credit, your children will wake up homeless on the continent their forefathers conquered.
[03:10:48.525 --> 03:10:49.946]  Okay?
[03:10:49.946 --> 03:10:52.087]  Our country was founded fighting these people.
[03:10:52.087 --> 03:10:54.448]  The Civil War was over this.
[03:10:54.448 --> 03:10:55.928]  Andrew Jackson fought this.
[03:10:55.928 --> 03:10:57.029]  So listen to me carefully.
[03:10:57.029 --> 03:10:58.670]  We're going to keep Bob to the bottom of the hour here.
[03:10:58.670 --> 03:11:03.932]  I want to give him some time, but I've got to lay the groundwork here with Bob Chapman of InternationalForecaster.com.
[03:11:04.927 --> 03:11:08.790]  Expert, one of the best researchers, best trends forecasters we've got.
[03:11:08.790 --> 03:11:13.614]  So I want him to take the floor here in just a moment, but I want to go over a few of these articles first.
[03:11:13.614 --> 03:11:16.577]  We are now entering the next to final phase.
[03:11:16.577 --> 03:11:28.307]  Greece is entering the final phase of what they do to third world countries, totally imploding them, making 99% of the population totally poor, half of them at or near starvation and homeless.
[03:11:28.307 --> 03:11:30.428]  This is total economic domination.
[03:11:30.428 --> 03:11:30.589]  Now,
[03:11:31.923 --> 03:11:40.168]  The IMF and World Bank, in the next to final phase, always take over the pension funds in the 401Ks.
[03:11:40.168 --> 03:11:50.734]  First they get the companies and governments, local, federal, you name it, the teacher funds, the police funds, to invest with them in the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report Prospectus.
[03:11:50.734 --> 03:11:51.394]  You want to look it up?
[03:11:51.394 --> 03:11:51.794]  Look it up.
[03:11:51.794 --> 03:11:54.096]  That's the double set of books, the real set of books.
[03:11:54.096 --> 03:11:58.238]  Chicago Mafia started it, the bankers picked it up in the 50s.
[03:11:58.238 --> 03:12:01.100]  Once they've done this, this is life or death folks,
[03:12:02.403 --> 03:12:07.904]  They then take over the pension funds and start taxing them and only pay you a part of it.
[03:12:07.904 --> 03:12:17.447]  Then in the next phase, they completely take your pension funds and they always put a riot police surveillance national police force in place before they do it.
[03:12:17.447 --> 03:12:19.167]  They've been building it for 20 years here.
[03:12:19.167 --> 03:12:24.989]  They now admit, the Pentagon's released documents, so has the British Ministry of Defense, that they've been getting ready for 20 years for this.
[03:12:24.989 --> 03:12:26.349]  This is their mass takeover.
[03:12:26.869 --> 03:12:32.973]  So we're now entering the final phases of this and it telescopes, it accelerates at the end.
[03:12:32.973 --> 03:12:38.077]  You'll see more robbing and looting in the next 3-4 years than you've seen in the last 80.
[03:12:38.077 --> 03:12:43.501]  Now, here's the two key articles, alright?
[03:12:43.501 --> 03:12:46.543]  Social Security to see payout exceeded
[03:12:48.314 --> 03:12:49.775]  In pay-ins this year.
[03:12:49.775 --> 03:12:52.277]  They bankrupted it by design.
[03:12:52.277 --> 03:12:53.738]  That's New York Times.
[03:12:53.738 --> 03:12:54.358]  Here's another one.
[03:12:54.358 --> 03:12:55.159]  Wall Street Journal.
[03:12:55.159 --> 03:12:57.320]  Personal income drops across the country.
[03:12:57.320 --> 03:13:00.122]  We're in a depression, folks, not a double-dip recession.
[03:13:00.122 --> 03:13:01.723]  Now, here's the key stories.
[03:13:01.723 --> 03:13:03.424]  Bloomberg.com.
[03:13:03.424 --> 03:13:07.347]  Failed banks may get pension fund backing as FDIC seeks cash.
[03:13:07.347 --> 03:13:12.230]  A year ago, the Federal Reserve and Treasury were talking about this.
[03:13:12.230 --> 03:13:16.693]  A month ago, they changed the rules to tax and to not insure your
[03:13:19.710 --> 03:13:21.732]  Money market accounts.
[03:13:21.732 --> 03:13:25.416]  They've told the banks get ready to hold money for seven days while they devalue.
[03:13:25.416 --> 03:13:26.036]  Citibank.
[03:13:26.036 --> 03:13:27.217]  We wrote that article about that.
[03:13:27.217 --> 03:13:28.138]  Drudge picked it up.
[03:13:28.138 --> 03:13:29.920]  We just found it on the Citibank website.
[03:13:29.920 --> 03:13:30.601]  They're now admitting it.
[03:13:31.499 --> 03:13:33.439]  Now listen to this, and we're going to Bob.
[03:13:33.439 --> 03:13:38.421]  Failed banks may get pension fund backing as FDIC seeks cash.
[03:13:38.421 --> 03:13:39.321]  Bloomberg.
[03:13:39.321 --> 03:13:40.981]  This is a week and a half old.
[03:13:40.981 --> 03:13:43.162]  The Federal Deposited Insurance Corp.
[03:13:43.162 --> 03:13:49.203]  is trying to encourage public retirement funds that control more than $2 trillion to buy all or more of failed lenders.
[03:13:49.203 --> 03:13:52.764]  Now, think of how they commonly announce that.
[03:13:52.764 --> 03:13:54.004]  Take your private
[03:13:55.606 --> 03:13:57.387]  Pension funds.
[03:13:57.387 --> 03:13:59.748]  They're already getting the police and firemen and teachers.
[03:13:59.748 --> 03:14:01.369]  You're going to be completely robbed.
[03:14:01.369 --> 03:14:04.250]  And you're going to be told, enforce a police state or you'll get nothing.
[03:14:04.250 --> 03:14:08.892]  This is how they suck you in and then you never get out because you keep hoping to get something.
[03:14:08.892 --> 03:14:10.073]  This is how they hold you hostage.
[03:14:11.818 --> 03:14:17.102]  Imagine, they're calmly announcing, and it says the federal regulators in this article are pressuring them.
[03:14:17.102 --> 03:14:25.869]  If they don't do what federal regulators say, they can find any nickel or dime crooked toenail to shut these firms down or arrest or charge their CEOs.
[03:14:25.869 --> 03:14:28.952]  So they're all saying, okay, we'll dump the money in.
[03:14:28.952 --> 03:14:33.315]  That's two trillion in private, not counting government pension funds.
[03:14:33.315 --> 03:14:36.198]  Taking a more direct role in propping up the banking system
[03:14:37.290 --> 03:14:39.253]  Said people briefed on the matter.
[03:14:39.253 --> 03:14:40.315]  So they're holding you hostage.
[03:14:40.315 --> 03:14:43.620]  We'll crash everything if you don't go ahead and give us your money.
[03:14:43.620 --> 03:14:45.703]  Then they take half of it or more.
[03:14:45.703 --> 03:14:47.947]  Oregon's retirement fund may contribute a hundred million.
[03:14:47.947 --> 03:14:48.728]  It goes on from there.
[03:14:49.810 --> 03:14:52.851]  Current rules don't prohibit pension funds from buying failed banks.
[03:14:52.851 --> 03:14:56.973]  So, they're saying they're going to invest your money in failed banks.
[03:14:56.973 --> 03:15:01.535]  Then they take the money out the back door, implode the bank, and say, well, you invested in it.
[03:15:01.535 --> 03:15:02.856]  Here's another one.
[03:15:02.856 --> 03:15:03.736]  World Net Daily.
[03:15:03.736 --> 03:15:06.597]  Obama ally targets 401k dollars.
[03:15:06.597 --> 03:15:09.498]  Trillions in IRA funds could be forced into U.S.
[03:15:09.498 --> 03:15:10.139]  Treasury debt.
[03:15:10.879 --> 03:15:13.180]  I've been beating the drum for a week and a half on this.
[03:15:13.180 --> 03:15:14.861]  Now, I'm going to shut up.
[03:15:14.861 --> 03:15:20.425]  We're going to hold Bob until 30 after, so the end of this segment, the next segment, then we'll come back and take calls.
[03:15:20.425 --> 03:15:23.246]  But Bob Chapman, you've got the floor.
[03:15:23.246 --> 03:15:24.968]  They really mean on doing this.
[03:15:24.968 --> 03:15:26.168]  They intend to do this.
[03:15:26.168 --> 03:15:26.769]  This is a
[03:15:27.789 --> 03:15:31.411]  We put up with the last fraud, trillions stolen by the Federal Reserve.
[03:15:31.411 --> 03:15:33.471]  They won't say where the money went to Congress.
[03:15:33.471 --> 03:15:35.252]  Why not go ahead and take the pension funds?
[03:15:35.252 --> 03:15:36.813]  They've done it all over the world.
[03:15:36.813 --> 03:15:37.713]  They know how to do it.
[03:15:37.713 --> 03:15:39.734]  They know how to propagandize.
[03:15:39.734 --> 03:15:41.275]  A. Why are they doing it?
[03:15:41.275 --> 03:15:43.516]  B. When are they going to start doing it?
[03:15:43.516 --> 03:15:46.097]  And C. How do they think they're going to get away with it?
[03:15:46.097 --> 03:15:48.438]  Bob Chapman.
[03:15:48.438 --> 03:15:55.080]  Well, about four months ago I came out with this kind of information and I was summarily attacked for it.
[03:15:57.260 --> 03:16:10.270]  And I guess the harbinger, the bringer of bad news is always rejected, even though the bad news is the truth.
[03:16:10.270 --> 03:16:16.194]  The going forward of the looting of retirement plans
[03:16:17.014 --> 03:16:17.315]  I don't
[03:16:36.509 --> 03:16:49.853]  Either a voluntary program or a 5% tax on everybody to be held for you until you retire, or whether it'll be mandatory right away, which I don't think it will be.
[03:16:49.853 --> 03:17:04.917]  Then they are, as Alex pointed out, getting the public pension funds to get involved in this program, which I explained earlier is just a prop up, a system that is collapsing.
[03:17:06.322 --> 03:17:09.604]  I've learned other things along the way.
[03:17:09.604 --> 03:17:24.352]  About four months ago, we said that at the end of the year or next year, FDIC will be broke and government will not come in and lend them $500 billion or whatever it is to keep them afloat.
[03:17:24.352 --> 03:17:27.294]  The reason is they don't want
[03:17:28.084 --> 03:17:39.524]  The savings of people to be insured because they're going for the final move into what they're going to do to bring down the system, as Alex said a little earlier.
[03:17:40.720 --> 03:18:02.180]  Another thing that they're going to do here, and you were talking, Alex, about them taking the funds from pensions to, or are supposedly asking, to buy this toxic waste, which is these bonds which contain mortgages.
[03:18:02.180 --> 03:18:04.962]  That toxic waste will come from the FDIC,
[03:18:06.327 --> 03:18:11.671]  And also from the Federal Reserve, which has been purchasing it.
[03:18:11.671 --> 03:18:21.519]  I think they admitted they purchased about $1.2 trillion of it from banks and brokerage houses and insurance companies.
[03:18:21.519 --> 03:18:33.008]  And so, they are going to go ahead and try to, in some form, attack your retirement
[03:18:33.969 --> 03:18:44.518]  And they are going to try to force, and that won't be hard, public institutions, pension funds, to purchase these things.
[03:18:44.518 --> 03:18:54.506]  And they're also going to put as many small and medium-sized banks out of business as quickly as possible.
[03:18:54.506 --> 03:18:58.069]  We could easily see 500 banks go into this year.
[03:18:58.069 --> 03:18:59.510]  They're just getting rolling.
[03:19:00.734 --> 03:19:11.581]  And there's a couple of thousand banks out there that are being overseen with people on the spot from the controller of the currency office.
[03:19:11.581 --> 03:19:22.387]  And the paperwork, the plan, to nationalize the banking system is already in draft form at the Fed Reserve.
[03:19:22.387 --> 03:19:25.569]  And I know that for sure, because my source saw it.
[03:19:27.249 --> 03:19:28.489]  Bob, stay there.
[03:19:28.489 --> 03:19:29.990]  Bob, this is big news.
[03:19:29.990 --> 03:19:31.091]  You never make stuff up.
[03:19:31.091 --> 03:19:34.393]  You've broken news years before it happens before.
[03:19:34.393 --> 03:19:39.655]  This is bona fide Bob Chapman straight ahead, inside info from inside the Federal Reserve.
[03:19:39.655 --> 03:19:40.336]  Think of it.
[03:19:40.336 --> 03:19:41.577]  They calmly come out.
[03:19:41.577 --> 03:19:42.757]  They think so little of you.
[03:19:42.757 --> 03:19:44.118]  They think you're so stupid.
[03:19:44.118 --> 03:19:46.299]  And they say, we're going to invest your pension funds.
[03:19:46.299 --> 03:19:50.922]  The government's going to order your company to invest it in toxic assets.
[03:19:50.922 --> 03:19:52.663]  Think of the magnitude of this.
[03:19:59.685 --> 03:20:01.648]  Afraid to answer it?
[03:20:01.648 --> 03:20:03.530]  Afraid to answer your door?
[03:20:03.530 --> 03:20:10.840]  Did you know that debt settlement, bankruptcy, and attorneys will cost you about 10 times more than you would legally be required to pay creditors?
[03:20:10.840 --> 03:20:13.063]  These are not ways to help you get out of debt.
[03:20:13.063 --> 03:20:15.085]  They are expensive payment plans.
[03:20:15.085 --> 03:20:17.108]  And if you're in debt already, does it make sense?

[03:20:55.167 --> 03:20:59.170]  The mighty Roman soldier was given a daily ration of fermented fish oil.
[03:20:59.170 --> 03:21:04.194]  The stoic Scandinavian Viking had a drum of fermenting cod livers outside the door of his home.
[03:21:04.194 --> 03:21:07.436]  And Grandma always had cod liver oil in the cupboard.
[03:21:07.436 --> 03:21:16.502]  Today, Green Pasture Products, a family-owned business, provides high-quality, nutrient-dense cod and other fish liver oils made in the same way they've been made throughout history prior to 1850.
[03:21:17.483 --> 03:21:18.703]  Through fermentation!
[03:21:18.703 --> 03:21:26.106]  Cold fermented cod liver oil from Green Pasture is rich in vitamins A, D, E, K, omega-3, omega-9s, and more.
[03:21:26.106 --> 03:21:27.846]  But no man-made nutrients.
[03:21:27.846 --> 03:21:29.307]  Only what the fish provides.
[03:21:29.307 --> 03:21:32.628]  Green Pasture's products are clean, independently tested for impurities.
[03:21:32.808 --> 03:21:33.088]  We're good.

[03:22:56.107 --> 03:23:00.109]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:23:00.109 --> 03:23:03.370]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:23:03.370 --> 03:23:04.771]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:23:05.481 --> 03:23:08.162]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:23:08.162 --> 03:23:14.546]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:23:14.546 --> 03:23:20.088]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:23:20.088 --> 03:23:29.713]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:23:29.833 --> 03:23:32.174]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:23:32.174 --> 03:23:33.775]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:23:33.775 --> 03:23:36.236]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:23:36.236 --> 03:23:38.357]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:23:38.357 --> 03:23:43.500]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[03:23:57.324 --> 03:24:00.525]  I just got off the phone with Anderson Cooper's producer.
[03:24:00.525 --> 03:24:05.947]  They have a special tonight about how evil I am, but they're going to let me respond.
[03:24:05.947 --> 03:24:12.530]  They're going to interview me for 10 minutes on a satellite feed, and they said I will then have 30 seconds.
[03:24:12.530 --> 03:24:17.512]  They will choose the 30 seconds in a five minute hit piece with congressmen
[03:24:19.554 --> 03:24:21.997]  The piece is about, am I causing all of this?
[03:24:21.997 --> 03:24:25.902]  It's like the London Guardian saying Alex Jones is a black hole causing.
[03:24:25.902 --> 03:24:33.392]  No, the banks being criminal, announcing they're going to take your pension funds next and taking over health care is what's causing this.
[03:24:33.392 --> 03:24:34.633]  I need everybody's prayers, folks.
[03:24:34.633 --> 03:24:35.274]  I mean, they are.
[03:24:35.274 --> 03:24:36.396]  Southern Property Law Center, ADL.
[03:24:37.879 --> 03:24:43.961]  CNN, they're all coming after me, and they're coming after you, and it's all about the Enemy Belligerence Act.
[03:24:43.961 --> 03:24:46.022]  I'm going to cover this in the next segment.
[03:24:46.022 --> 03:24:51.563]  I mean, we're here telling the truth, and they're hopping mad we're exposing the insurance companies are behind this.
[03:24:51.563 --> 03:24:53.224]  Limbaugh won't tell you that, okay?
[03:24:53.224 --> 03:24:54.904]  He'll tell you it's a bunch of commies doing this.
[03:24:54.904 --> 03:24:56.385]  No, it's a bunch of banks.
[03:24:56.385 --> 03:25:01.986]  Bob Chapman, going back to you, what do you think of this CNN news?
[03:25:01.986 --> 03:25:06.048]  It's what you would expect.
[03:25:06.048 --> 03:25:06.988]  It's as simple as that.
[03:25:09.025 --> 03:25:12.748]  But I didn't know we were this effective, Bob!
[03:25:12.748 --> 03:25:18.532]  Well, you know, you have, but I've been more outspoken about it.
[03:25:18.532 --> 03:25:20.974]  We have got these people on the run.
[03:25:20.974 --> 03:25:31.421]  The first clue was when we saw other radio personalities copying what you were doing, and then Beck going to the limit on it.
[03:25:33.457 --> 03:25:38.979]  You knew that they were trying to steal your thunder because you were telling the truth.
[03:25:38.979 --> 03:25:47.181]  But what they were doing, as the audience knows, 95% truth, 5% misdirection and cop propaganda.
[03:25:47.181 --> 03:25:50.442]  Now, they found that that was unaffected.
[03:25:50.442 --> 03:25:55.324]  They're not denting the armor of Alex and others like him.
[03:25:55.324 --> 03:26:01.666]  So the next step is, you're like a national disease and you're causing all this.
[03:26:02.680 --> 03:26:13.971]  And I can't say no, though, because I said, if I say no, you're going to say I refuse to be interviewed.
[03:26:13.971 --> 03:26:15.332]  Yes, we are.
[03:26:15.332 --> 03:26:20.077]  But then I countered, but this this isn't even really an interview, is it?
[03:26:20.077 --> 03:26:21.358]  You're going to show 30 seconds.
[03:26:21.358 --> 03:26:24.341]  And they laughed and said, that's exactly what we're going to do.
[03:26:24.341 --> 03:26:25.963]  They're going to say, here's the devil.
[03:26:27.987 --> 03:26:31.729]  Oh man, I've got them saying I'm basically a cop killer everywhere.
[03:26:31.729 --> 03:26:33.029]  They're really setting me up.
[03:26:33.029 --> 03:26:40.613]  They think the cops are dumb and they can tell the cops that everything's my fault when I'm trying to hold people back from violence.
[03:26:40.613 --> 03:26:44.554]  Look, I didn't mean to get distracted off into this, Bob, talking about the CNN thing.
[03:26:44.554 --> 03:26:49.156]  In closing here, you know the power of federal regulators.
[03:26:49.156 --> 03:26:54.219]  They're going in, it's in the articles, they're ordering the pension funds to invest with the government.
[03:26:56.243 --> 03:27:04.026]  Then I guess when people get mad, the government's gonna say we're terrorists because we should be happy they're taking people's pension funds.
[03:27:04.026 --> 03:27:07.748]  And that's really the bottom line.
[03:27:07.748 --> 03:27:13.270]  They mug us, they rob us, and then if we even speak up, we're bad.
[03:27:13.270 --> 03:27:15.010]  That's right.
[03:27:15.010 --> 03:27:19.732]  And that's what I have endured for almost 50 years.
[03:27:19.732 --> 03:27:24.094]  If you think Anamadillo's got a strong skin, try mine.
[03:27:25.345 --> 03:27:27.105]  I know Bob, they ran you out of the USA.
[03:27:27.105 --> 03:27:29.186]  You're not even in the U.S.
[03:27:29.186 --> 03:27:30.586]  That's right.
[03:27:30.586 --> 03:27:37.267]  How long's it been since you... I don't like getting shot at.
[03:27:37.267 --> 03:27:38.627]  Oh God.
[03:27:38.627 --> 03:27:41.988]  I just... And to hear these producers giggling and laughing.
[03:27:41.988 --> 03:27:43.308]  This is all funny to them.
[03:27:43.308 --> 03:27:45.288]  Do they realize how real this is, Bob?
[03:27:45.288 --> 03:27:50.749]  And that their sorry butt isn't worth one cent more than my butt to the New World Order?
[03:27:50.749 --> 03:27:53.890]  That's right, but they don't know that because they don't understand what you do.
[03:27:54.881 --> 03:28:00.727]  They don't understand what the problem is, because they're making too much money.
[03:28:00.727 --> 03:28:04.791]  I mean, you're not making 10 or 20 million dollars a year, they are.
[03:28:04.791 --> 03:28:07.233]  So why do they care about you or me or anybody like that?
[03:28:07.233 --> 03:28:11.197]  Yeah, but I wouldn't sell out, you wouldn't sell out for a trillion.
[03:28:11.197 --> 03:28:16.262]  Yeah, but you don't, maybe the other 85% of the people in the country would.
[03:28:16.262 --> 03:28:17.724]  And that's the group that they're in.
[03:28:21.280 --> 03:28:22.781]  Well, I've just had enough, man.
[03:28:22.781 --> 03:28:24.742]  I tell you what, we've got to beat these people.
[03:28:24.742 --> 03:28:26.564]  And they are getting desperate.
[03:28:26.564 --> 03:28:30.907]  Do you agree with me that they're going to stage some terror attacks and blame it on patriots?
[03:28:30.907 --> 03:28:31.627]  Absolutely.
[03:28:31.627 --> 03:28:35.010]  But I don't know the timing, but they're going to do something.
[03:28:35.010 --> 03:28:37.652]  Desperate people do desperate things.
[03:28:37.652 --> 03:28:41.534]  And that is going to happen.
[03:28:41.534 --> 03:28:48.259]  Boy, they're arrogant if they think they can steal people's pension funds to, quote, buy failed banks.
[03:28:48.259 --> 03:28:50.981]  Well, we've been reporting on it just like you have.
[03:28:51.559 --> 03:28:53.560]  And that's what they're up to.
[03:28:53.560 --> 03:28:59.042]  And, you know, the question is, when are they going to make the move that's visible?
[03:28:59.042 --> 03:29:09.765]  And when they do, the first thing I will do is get my subscribers out of those kinds of retirement plans that they can get out of.
[03:29:09.765 --> 03:29:14.947]  And it's simple to do that without incurring a lot of cost.
[03:29:14.947 --> 03:29:19.609]  And sure, sure, you're going to have to pay taxes, but that's just the way it is.
[03:29:21.075 --> 03:29:23.056]  Bob, it's always informative having you on.
[03:29:23.056 --> 03:29:25.996]  We really appreciate your expertise and time today in the last hour and a half.
[03:29:25.996 --> 03:29:29.217]  We'll talk to you again, if I'm still here, next Friday.
[03:29:29.217 --> 03:29:30.117]  God bless you, my friend.
[03:29:30.117 --> 03:29:34.158]  Same to you, and thank you everyone for listening.
[03:29:34.158 --> 03:29:34.859]  We'll be back!
[03:29:34.859 --> 03:29:42.080]  I'll get into the government's plan to arrest you for absolutely no reason, have the military hold you, and torture you into fake confessions.
[03:29:42.080 --> 03:29:43.401]  The New Inquisition is here.
[03:29:43.401 --> 03:29:45.201]  Stay with us.
[03:29:45.201 --> 03:29:46.582]  We're on the march.
[03:29:46.582 --> 03:29:48.102]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:49.113 --> 03:29:54.775]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:54.775 --> 03:29:55.935]  What's your home worth?
[03:29:55.935 --> 03:29:58.056]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[03:29:58.056 --> 03:30:01.097]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[03:30:01.097 --> 03:30:08.800]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.
[03:30:08.800 --> 03:30:12.221]  HomeGain.com will help you find a realtor to buy or sell a home.

[03:30:39.019 --> 03:30:41.381]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:30:41.381 --> 03:30:43.883]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:30:43.883 --> 03:30:44.944]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:31:05.258 --> 03:31:08.506]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:31:08.506 --> 03:31:11.533]  Tremendous influence on our president and Congress.
[03:31:12.239 --> 03:31:14.119]  And they really are calling the shots.
[03:31:14.119 --> 03:31:19.680]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:31:19.680 --> 03:31:29.442]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:31:29.442 --> 03:31:31.762]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:31:31.762 --> 03:31:33.363]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:31:33.363 --> 03:31:35.823]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:31:35.823 --> 03:31:37.943]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:31:37.943 --> 03:31:40.704]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[03:31:41.460 --> 03:31:43.083]  A Fall of the Republic.
[03:31:43.083 --> 03:31:52.222]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[03:31:54.096 --> 03:31:54.876]  Hi, everyone.
[03:31:54.876 --> 03:31:55.937]  Andy Anderson here.
[03:31:55.937 --> 03:32:00.338]  Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria, and other nasties?
[03:32:00.338 --> 03:32:06.139]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day.
[03:32:06.139 --> 03:32:10.481]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, good-bye effectiveness?
[03:32:10.481 --> 03:32:12.181]  No more protection till you use it again.
[03:32:12.341 --> 03:32:13.681]  PureWorks to the rescue!
[03:32:13.681 --> 03:32:18.082]  Our FDA-compliant foam, lotion, soap, and spray do not contain alcohol.
[03:32:18.082 --> 03:32:20.283]  Their killing power lasts up to four hours.
[03:32:20.283 --> 03:32:33.346]  PureWorks Disinfecting Spray is EPA-certified to kill swine flu, bird flu, MRSA, HIV, hepatitis B and C, and for our friends in medicine, kills C. diff, along with a whole host of viruses and bacteria, molds, and fungus, too.

[03:32:34.986 --> 03:32:38.168]  You'll love how your skin feels with PureWorks Soft and Supple.
[03:32:38.168 --> 03:32:39.328]  No more dry skin.
[03:32:39.328 --> 03:32:43.931]  Here's to a little peace of mind knowing that your hands are still germ-free hours later.
[03:32:43.931 --> 03:32:51.095]  Call now toll-free 888-245-0300 to get your hands on PureWorks and get PureWorks on your hands.
[03:32:51.095 --> 03:32:51.375]  That's 888-245-0300.
[03:33:02.776 --> 03:33:22.541]  The reason neocon-controlled liberal corporate media, the ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, Time Magazine, Newsweek, London Guardian, New York Times, are all coming after Alex Jones, yours truly, is because we understand who the enemy is.
[03:33:22.541 --> 03:33:32.143]  I'll get up on air and go, here's Bloomberg reporting that the government's preparing to take over your pension funds and invest them in failed banks.
[03:33:34.810 --> 03:33:36.932]  That's wrong!
[03:33:36.932 --> 03:33:44.338]  And for that, it's on record that the Pentagon surveils us, follows us around, goes to our end the Fed rallies.
[03:33:44.338 --> 03:33:45.719]  I'm being demonized.
[03:33:45.719 --> 03:33:52.344]  Within two hours of Richard Blasky killing three cops, he was a white supremacist, he posted all over the internet hating me.
[03:33:52.344 --> 03:33:57.909]  Within two hours of him being in custody, they got his computer and said he did it because of Alex Jones.
[03:33:57.909 --> 03:34:01.492]  We played a clip last week of the Southern Poverty Law Center saying Alex Jones caused it.
[03:34:03.715 --> 03:34:10.538]  They're going to law enforcement and saying I am causing this when I'm here telling people not to be violent.
[03:34:10.538 --> 03:34:15.479]  They are doing it because they want to demonize me and set me up.
[03:34:15.479 --> 03:34:24.223]  And I'm so clean and I pay all the fraudulent IRS taxes and don't do anything but maybe speed in my car occasionally.
[03:34:24.223 --> 03:34:26.083]  I do nothing!
[03:34:26.083 --> 03:34:29.184]  I am as clean as a lily.
[03:34:29.184 --> 03:34:29.905]  They don't care.
[03:34:29.905 --> 03:34:30.485]  And you know what?
[03:34:31.860 --> 03:34:38.726]  If they set me up, it's a sign of our success, and whatever they try, that's just the way it is with these terrorists.
[03:34:38.726 --> 03:34:51.456]  When they are terrorists, and they've staged the terror attacks, and they're doing it all, and they're getting ready to stage more stuff to blame it on the Tea Parties and everybody else, and where are those articles you gave me earlier where Obama people have been caught attacking their own offices, Denver Post?
[03:34:51.456 --> 03:34:54.258]  They'll never let me show that on CNN.
[03:34:54.258 --> 03:34:59.243]  I'm gonna go down there tonight, they're gonna interview me for 10, 15 minutes, for 30 seconds.
[03:34:59.243 --> 03:35:00.444]  They'll throw some point at me,
[03:35:01.667 --> 03:35:08.728]  Probably turn the audio off so I don't hear it, so I go, excuse me, to make me look, I know how they operate, to make it look like I can't hear you.
[03:35:08.728 --> 03:35:10.129]  Oh, we got him, look!
[03:35:10.129 --> 03:35:17.290]  Here's the devil, he can't even, but I can't say no, because they'll say I wouldn't show up for the interview.
[03:35:17.290 --> 03:35:21.671]  And then all the sheep watching will think, oh, he has something to hide.
[03:35:21.671 --> 03:35:26.031]  You make me sick.
[03:35:26.031 --> 03:35:29.372]  Anderson Cooper is admitted CIA, admittedly worked for the CIA.
[03:35:31.834 --> 03:35:39.301]  All right, I want to play the 60-second radio ad for the first time for the new film Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined.
[03:35:40.430 --> 03:35:42.632]  Now on pre-sale at Infowars.com.
[03:35:42.632 --> 03:35:44.193]  It ships out in April.
[03:35:44.193 --> 03:35:46.154]  Pre-order it now so you'll be the first to get it.
[03:35:46.154 --> 03:35:48.756]  Police State 4 also ships out in April.
[03:35:48.756 --> 03:35:49.376]  Pre-order that.
[03:35:49.376 --> 03:35:51.137]  It exposes the whole system.
[03:35:51.137 --> 03:35:52.658]  Everybody's got to see these films.
[03:35:52.658 --> 03:35:55.420]  The latest, most powerful info.
[03:35:55.420 --> 03:35:58.162]  CNN's got to reapply its lies millions of times.
[03:35:58.162 --> 03:36:00.784]  All we've got to do is show people the real paradigm once.
[03:36:00.784 --> 03:36:02.005]  Their minds are unlocked.
[03:36:02.005 --> 03:36:03.406]  That's why we're dangerous.
[03:36:03.406 --> 03:36:06.708]  They're coming after me because, more than anything else, the films.
[03:36:09.110 --> 03:36:10.030]  And I want a commitment.
[03:36:10.030 --> 03:36:21.133]  If they set me up, plant drugs on me, kill me, and put me in a room with a dead hooker, you know, whatever, or say I committed suicide, shoot me five times in the head, I will never commit suicide.
[03:36:21.133 --> 03:36:27.135]  I'm not involved in anything illegal, and everybody who knows me knows that, and they did it if anything happens to me.
[03:36:27.135 --> 03:36:33.477]  And if they do put me in prison or anything, I want you to promise now to yourself to commit
[03:36:35.421 --> 03:36:44.072]  That you, every listener, will make 1,000 copies of my films a year.
[03:36:44.072 --> 03:36:47.857]  Buy the DVD copier, buy the blanks, and make them and give them to people.
[03:36:49.218 --> 03:36:54.522]  And take the audio interviews I've done, the radio, the TV, the films, and just never stop getting them out.
[03:36:54.522 --> 03:36:56.083]  Because that's why.
[03:36:56.083 --> 03:36:57.003]  Freedom is worth it.
[03:36:57.003 --> 03:36:58.624]  Liberty is worth it.
[03:36:58.624 --> 03:37:01.566]  Signing my name, John Hancock, up at the top is worth it.
[03:37:01.566 --> 03:37:03.508]  Because I am not going to be a slave.
[03:37:03.508 --> 03:37:06.810]  These people are demonic and evil and corrupt.
[03:37:06.810 --> 03:37:09.772]  The government's been caught running giant child kidnapping, slavery rings.
[03:37:09.772 --> 03:37:11.353]  It's even in congressional testimony.
[03:37:11.353 --> 03:37:12.854]  They bring in the narcotics.
[03:37:12.854 --> 03:37:14.915]  They're stealing your pension funds.
[03:37:14.915 --> 03:37:16.136]  We must fight them.
[03:37:16.136 --> 03:37:17.297]  I don't have courage, folks.
[03:37:17.797 --> 03:37:21.039]  All I have is common sense and self-preservation instinct.
[03:37:21.039 --> 03:37:27.462]  You must meet this scum head-on or they will act just like Hitler and Stalin.
[03:37:27.462 --> 03:37:28.462]  You must expose them.
[03:37:28.462 --> 03:37:30.223]  They want to have violence now.
[03:37:30.223 --> 03:37:31.584]  They want to hype violence now.
[03:37:32.757 --> 03:37:34.778]  So that they can try to shut off debate.
[03:37:34.778 --> 03:37:35.598]  That's not going to work.
[03:37:35.598 --> 03:37:45.560]  This isn't 95 CNN, where your CIA bosses and the FBI and the BATF can blow up a federal building and demonize people that don't want to be slaves to government.
[03:37:45.560 --> 03:37:47.181]  You're not getting our stinking guns.
[03:37:47.181 --> 03:37:49.161]  You're not getting our property.
[03:37:49.161 --> 03:37:51.782]  You go ahead and try to take the pension funds, crooks.
[03:37:51.782 --> 03:37:52.482]  It's over.
[03:37:52.482 --> 03:37:53.282]  You're the crooks.
[03:37:53.282 --> 03:37:54.022]  You're corrupt.
[03:37:54.022 --> 03:37:54.943]  You're scum.
[03:37:54.943 --> 03:37:56.643]  And everybody's starting to wake up to it.
[03:37:57.756 --> 03:38:12.748]  And we're going to go to all your well-meaning idiot liberal supporters and we're going to show them how the insurance company stocks are way up and how they wrote this legislation and how it doesn't have coverage for people in pre-existing conditions and how top government officials are exempt from the plan.
[03:38:12.748 --> 03:38:22.476]  We're never going to shut up trash and we're going to shatter the left-right paradigm and bring this country back and bring the world back out of your tyrannical world government grip.
[03:38:22.476 --> 03:38:23.397]  Do you understand?
[03:38:25.458 --> 03:38:27.078]  I'm not afraid in the least.
[03:38:27.078 --> 03:38:30.219]  In fact, I'm thrilled they're coming after me.
[03:38:30.219 --> 03:38:32.320]  Whatever happens, I am committed.
[03:38:32.320 --> 03:38:38.241]  My name, my sacred honor, my family, my treasure, my blood, my sweat is all in.
[03:38:38.241 --> 03:38:41.822]  The enemy's all in, I'm all in.
[03:38:41.822 --> 03:38:43.623]  The fight's already on.
[03:38:43.623 --> 03:38:51.665]  You might have butterflies when some big bully's waiting for you at the end of your street when you get home from school when you're 14 years old and he's 18 and got a mustache.
[03:38:53.137 --> 03:38:57.659]  You may be a little scared as he's walking up to you, but as soon as you get in that fight, you're not scared anymore.
[03:38:57.659 --> 03:38:59.580]  Folks, get in the fight!
[03:38:59.580 --> 03:39:01.780]  They've drawn first blood a million times.
[03:39:01.780 --> 03:39:04.842]  We're drawing first blood in the info war, and we're not stopping.
[03:39:04.842 --> 03:39:05.802]  We're not mincing words.
[03:39:05.802 --> 03:39:07.443]  We're shattering their programming.
[03:39:07.443 --> 03:39:09.163]  We're shattering their disinfo.
[03:39:09.163 --> 03:39:12.165]  We're shattering how they set up false debates and false arguments.
[03:39:12.165 --> 03:39:14.766]  We're teaching people how they do it.
[03:39:14.766 --> 03:39:16.466]  And it's over for the New World Order.
[03:39:16.466 --> 03:39:17.947]  It is over for these terrorists.
[03:39:18.766 --> 03:39:22.747]  Just like they tried to claim Ron Paul's supporters were involved in violence two years ago.
[03:39:22.747 --> 03:39:25.368]  Now he's their darling, because they failed.
[03:39:25.368 --> 03:39:30.069]  They are going to fail if you simply keep taking action.
[03:39:30.069 --> 03:39:36.531]  So don't let it scare you if something happens to Alex Jones this month, or a year from now, or two years from now.
[03:39:36.531 --> 03:39:40.292]  I'm a fallen warrior in defense of the Republican humanity, whatever happens.
[03:39:40.292 --> 03:39:42.953]  If they destroy my name, whatever they do,
[03:39:44.429 --> 03:39:46.171]  I am ready.
[03:39:46.171 --> 03:39:47.592]  I asked for it.
[03:39:47.592 --> 03:39:48.733]  You understand?
[03:39:48.733 --> 03:39:49.914]  I didn't engage the enemy.
[03:39:49.914 --> 03:39:55.439]  It may not have been clear to me 14, 15 years ago, but it's been clear to me for 10 years.
[03:39:55.439 --> 03:39:56.760]  And it's been more and more clear every day.
[03:39:56.760 --> 03:40:06.809]  And I sleep great at night, except sometimes I wake up and literally wish I could do more and wish I was more informative and could really articulate to people the information that I've discovered and researched.
[03:40:11.169 --> 03:40:15.790]  In fact, I brought a big list of things I wrote late last night that I wanted to cover and talk about, just ideas and thoughts.
[03:40:15.790 --> 03:40:18.831]  I'll try to find it during the next break.
[03:40:18.831 --> 03:40:23.272]  Let's go and play the new radio ad that'll be in rotation on the network, on the podcast, and everywhere else.
[03:40:23.272 --> 03:40:24.112]  Please take action.
[03:40:24.112 --> 03:40:27.413]  This is the new radio ad for Invisible Empire.
[03:40:27.413 --> 03:40:27.893]  Here it is.
[03:40:27.893 --> 03:40:30.334]  They helped to create a new world order.
[03:40:30.334 --> 03:40:32.634]  We are part of a new world order.
[03:40:32.634 --> 03:40:35.835]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[03:40:35.835 --> 03:40:40.596]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:40:40.956 --> 03:40:45.461]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:40:45.461 --> 03:40:47.923]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:40:47.923 --> 03:40:50.366]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:40:50.366 --> 03:40:53.609]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:40:53.609 --> 03:41:01.217]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:41:01.537 --> 03:41:06.918]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:41:06.918 --> 03:41:09.239]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:41:09.239 --> 03:41:13.460]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:41:13.460 --> 03:41:15.881]  And I got news for you, you're everyone else.
[03:41:15.881 --> 03:41:17.361]  Invisible Empire.

[03:41:28.303 --> 03:41:29.904]  Invisible Empire.
[03:41:29.904 --> 03:41:30.744]  Order it.
[03:41:30.744 --> 03:41:31.844]  This is my work.
[03:41:31.844 --> 03:41:33.745]  This is Burmese's work.
[03:41:33.745 --> 03:41:35.765]  This is everything we've done.
[03:41:35.765 --> 03:41:36.926]  Everything we've put together.
[03:41:36.926 --> 03:41:44.628]  Everything that we have put on the line here.
[03:41:44.628 --> 03:41:49.470]  I just wish the general public knew the cost and understood history and what bondage is really all about.
[03:41:54.938 --> 03:42:03.200]  I wish all these evil little gibbering people that work for the system who think they've got all this power and they're part of the winning team.
[03:42:03.200 --> 03:42:05.380]  I wish they realized they're only alive once on this planet.
[03:42:05.380 --> 03:42:07.441]  It's so precious to know the truth.
[03:42:07.441 --> 03:42:14.823]  It's so precious to be on the side of right.
[03:42:14.823 --> 03:42:17.303]  The country is on the verge of real revolution.
[03:42:17.303 --> 03:42:21.804]  They want to stage terror attacks so that they can nip it in the bud.
[03:42:21.804 --> 03:42:24.085]  The country is in peaceful revolution right now.
[03:42:25.216 --> 03:42:32.039]  The system is lawlessly social engineering this country.
[03:42:32.039 --> 03:42:35.621]  Here's the actual bill.
[03:42:35.621 --> 03:42:37.242]  You can go read the subsections of it.
[03:42:37.242 --> 03:42:41.404]  Give me a document cam shot, please.
[03:42:41.404 --> 03:42:49.068]  S-3081, Senate 3081, introduced by John McCain and Lindsey Graham.
[03:42:49.068 --> 03:42:53.670]  And they advertise this, we shouldn't let go Al-Qaeda, we gotta take their rights.
[03:42:53.670 --> 03:42:54.471]  But when you read the bill,
[03:42:55.672 --> 03:42:56.633]  It says it's for U.S.
[03:42:56.633 --> 03:43:09.019]  citizens or anybody else they wish, that they can secretly arrest you and have enhanced interrogation, torture, and that only an act of Congress can ever get you out of the secret prison.
[03:43:09.019 --> 03:43:13.081]  And even if anyone knows you've been arrested, they don't have to tell anybody you've ever been arrested.
[03:43:13.081 --> 03:43:17.923]  They just put a bag over your head, you disappear to a torture camp full of psychopaths and sadists that enjoy this.
[03:43:20.742 --> 03:43:21.703]  This is pure evil.
[03:43:21.703 --> 03:43:22.723]  This is Hitler.
[03:43:22.723 --> 03:43:23.504]  This is Stalin.
[03:43:23.504 --> 03:43:24.104]  This is Mao.
[03:43:24.104 --> 03:43:25.285]  This is Pol Pot.
[03:43:25.285 --> 03:43:26.126]  This is it.
[03:43:26.126 --> 03:43:27.787]  Bonafide.
[03:43:27.787 --> 03:43:29.849]  You know, the Nazis didn't pass this stuff into law.
[03:43:29.849 --> 03:43:30.569]  They just did it.
[03:43:30.569 --> 03:43:32.911]  The Soviets didn't.
[03:43:32.911 --> 03:43:37.194]  We've got an article that boils it down and has the subsection snipped out.
[03:43:37.194 --> 03:43:38.335]  The PDF filed.
[03:43:38.335 --> 03:43:43.039]  And I want to read to you from the bill.
[03:43:43.039 --> 03:43:46.301]  The sinners to be detained as enemy belligerents.
[03:43:46.301 --> 03:43:47.082]  PrisonPlanet.com
[03:43:49.554 --> 03:43:53.296]  Since the establishment media, and this is from March 8th, a few weeks ago.
[03:43:53.296 --> 03:43:54.456]  See how it's all coming true?
[03:43:54.456 --> 03:44:18.646]  Since the establishment media is convinced that the Tea Party members, 9-11 truthers, libertarians, Ron Paul supporters, and basically anyone with a dissenting political opinion is a likely domestic terrorist, and we have the new Homeland Security report today about that, they should be celebrating the fact that a new bill would allow the government to detain such people as enemy belligerents, indefinitely and without trial, based on their suspected activity.
[03:44:19.286 --> 03:44:41.843]  The Enemy Belligerent Interrogation, Detention, and Prosecution Act of 2010, introduced by Senators John McCain and Joseph Lieberman on Thursday with little fanfare, sets out comprehensive policy for the detention, interrogation, and trial of suspected enemy belligerents who are believed to have engaged in hostilities against the United States by requiring these individuals to be held in a military custody.
[03:44:41.843 --> 03:44:43.265]  Yeah, it's a kangaroo military trial.
[03:44:44.292 --> 03:44:53.256]  Interrogated for their intelligence value and not provided with a Miranda warning, writes the Atlantic Monthly's Mark Ababender.
[03:44:53.256 --> 03:44:54.717]  Read the bill at this PDF link.
[03:44:56.806 --> 03:44:58.647]  The bill does not distinguish between U.S.
[03:44:58.647 --> 03:45:07.091]  citizens and non-citizens and states that suspected belligerents who are considered a high-value detainee shall not be provided with Miranda warning.
[03:45:07.091 --> 03:45:12.154]  A person is considered a high-value detainee if they fulfill one of the following criteria.
[03:45:12.154 --> 03:45:14.755]  Number one, now listen carefully.
[03:45:14.755 --> 03:45:17.857]  Sounds reasonable up front, but in the presence for everyone.
[03:45:18.837 --> 03:45:23.841]  Poses a threat of an attack on civilians or civilian facilities within the United States or U.S.
[03:45:23.841 --> 03:45:25.022]  facilities abroad.
[03:45:25.022 --> 03:45:26.644]  So they say you pose a threat.
[03:45:26.644 --> 03:45:29.446]  And remember what happened at the G20 a few months ago.
[03:45:29.446 --> 03:45:37.313]  Rob Dood, Jason Bermas, and Jason Douglas call the military base where the troops are massing the day before the G20.
[03:45:37.313 --> 03:45:37.853]  We call.
[03:45:37.853 --> 03:45:39.354]  We want to interview your press person.
[03:45:39.354 --> 03:45:40.996]  They have a press conference.
[03:45:40.996 --> 03:45:41.896]  Our guys pull up.
[03:45:41.896 --> 03:45:42.857]  Hi, here's our card.
[03:45:42.857 --> 03:45:43.798]  Here's who we are.
[03:45:43.798 --> 03:45:45.059]  They said, go wait over there.
[03:45:45.059 --> 03:45:46.580]  They come and they say, we'll talk to you tomorrow.
[03:45:46.580 --> 03:45:46.841]  Leave.
[03:45:47.930 --> 03:45:49.831]  They say, thank you, sir, and leave.
[03:45:49.831 --> 03:45:56.214]  They call the police and say terrorists were here trying to attack the fence.
[03:45:56.214 --> 03:45:59.155]  A car followed them as they left.
[03:45:59.155 --> 03:46:06.458]  In Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, we have the actual video of the military saying, yeah, we'll get somebody for you to talk to, and yeah, come back tomorrow.
[03:46:06.458 --> 03:46:08.519]  They just, we're not even human.
[03:46:08.519 --> 03:46:09.239]  You're a terrorist.
[03:46:09.239 --> 03:46:10.380]  You asked me a question.
[03:46:10.380 --> 03:46:11.240]  You were polite to me.
[03:46:11.240 --> 03:46:12.100]  You're not even a human.
[03:46:12.100 --> 03:46:13.301]  You're just a terrorist.
[03:46:13.301 --> 03:46:13.881]  I'm God.
[03:46:13.881 --> 03:46:14.982]  You lose all your rights.
[03:46:14.982 --> 03:46:15.502]  I say so.
[03:46:21.581 --> 03:46:26.123]  And we've caught the military and police everywhere provocateuring attacks on themselves.
[03:46:26.123 --> 03:46:30.204]  Number one, pose a threat of an attack on civilians or civilian facilities in the U.S.
[03:46:30.204 --> 03:46:30.544]  or U.S.
[03:46:30.544 --> 03:46:31.825]  facilities abroad.
[03:46:31.825 --> 03:46:35.406]  They arrested that woman for taking photos of the base she thought was a FEMA camp in New York.
[03:46:35.406 --> 03:46:38.007]  Two, poses a threat to U.S.
[03:46:38.007 --> 03:46:39.508]  military personnel or U.S.
[03:46:39.508 --> 03:46:41.369]  military facilities.
[03:46:41.369 --> 03:46:44.470]  Three, potential intelligence value.
[03:46:44.470 --> 03:46:50.232]  Any potential intelligence value, you get a bag over your head and you go to a torture camp, because there's rapers that like it.
[03:46:52.125 --> 03:46:53.806]  Uncle Sam's got a job for him.
[03:46:53.806 --> 03:46:54.866]  Uncle Banker.
[03:46:54.866 --> 03:47:07.412]  Number four, is a member of an Al-Qaeda or terrorist group affiliated with Al-Qaeda or, these are all different reasons, see they mix in Al-Qaeda in the middle, and such other matters as the president considers appropriate.
[03:47:07.412 --> 03:47:11.334]  Just like the cyber security bill says the president can just shut down the entire internet.
[03:47:12.113 --> 03:47:14.294]  That's Forbes, AP Reuters headline.
[03:47:14.294 --> 03:47:17.795]  President can shut down the internet whenever he wants, or restrict it or censor it.
[03:47:17.795 --> 03:47:23.177]  And you've got this emboldened Ed Schultz on MSNBC going, we need to shut Limbaugh off.
[03:47:23.177 --> 03:47:25.358]  We need to kick all these people off the radio.
[03:47:25.358 --> 03:47:29.599]  And all these White House officials are agreeing.
[03:47:29.599 --> 03:47:31.020]  Now your free speech is bad too.
[03:47:33.075 --> 03:47:34.716]  This is treason.
[03:47:34.716 --> 03:47:36.156]  This is treachery.
[03:47:36.156 --> 03:47:37.517]  This is tyranny.
[03:47:37.517 --> 03:47:39.017]  This is corruption.
[03:47:39.017 --> 03:47:40.338]  This is un-American.
[03:47:40.338 --> 03:47:43.559]  This is classical corruption.
[03:47:43.559 --> 03:47:48.261]  This is authoritarian sickness spreading in the nation.
[03:47:48.261 --> 03:47:49.842]  And we're here saying, stop!
[03:47:49.842 --> 03:47:50.402]  Stop!
[03:47:50.402 --> 03:47:51.803]  Don't take the pension funds.
[03:47:51.803 --> 03:47:53.003]  Don't rob the people.
[03:47:53.003 --> 03:47:54.744]  Don't take over health care with the IRS.
[03:47:54.744 --> 03:47:56.765]  Don't... It's a rip-off.
[03:47:56.765 --> 03:47:57.485]  The banks wrote it.
[03:47:57.485 --> 03:47:58.385]  The insurance company.
[03:47:58.385 --> 03:47:59.566]  They're like, shut up, terrorist.
[03:47:59.566 --> 03:48:00.486]  Shut up, terrorist.
[03:48:00.486 --> 03:48:01.186]  I'm talking to CNN.
[03:48:01.186 --> 03:48:02.267]  They go, oh, the piece is about you.
[03:48:03.527 --> 03:48:16.193]  We're talking to people in Washington about how dangerous you are and are you influencing all the stuff that's happening and there was a guy giggling in the background and I'm just like, this is really America.
[03:48:16.193 --> 03:48:26.218]  This is really the Orwellian state where these little yuppies in their little coddled, cloistered positions don't even think of me as a human.
[03:48:27.324 --> 03:48:31.367]  I'm just some nut who doesn't like what's happening, because I've read a history book or two.
[03:48:31.367 --> 03:48:34.989]  Because I know what evil is.
[03:48:34.989 --> 03:48:37.491]  And because I'm reaching millions of people.
[03:48:37.491 --> 03:48:39.492]  And I'm real, folks.
[03:48:39.492 --> 03:48:40.653]  I'm real.
[03:48:40.653 --> 03:48:43.615]  The fruits of what we've done are real.
[03:48:43.615 --> 03:48:45.897]  The millions we've woken up is real.
[03:48:45.897 --> 03:48:49.259]  The fact that we're identifying the enemies of this republic is real.
[03:48:49.259 --> 03:48:51.460]  And they know, the system knows I'm real.
[03:48:51.460 --> 03:48:52.841]  The system surveils me.
[03:48:52.841 --> 03:48:53.342]  They know.
[03:48:54.656 --> 03:48:58.039]  And I know why a lot of people buy into some of the COINTELPRO.
[03:48:58.039 --> 03:48:59.881]  It's a minority, but it's a wide group.
[03:48:59.881 --> 03:49:01.502]  They can't believe I'm still alive.
[03:49:01.502 --> 03:49:03.824]  They can't believe I've got the courage to do this.
[03:49:03.824 --> 03:49:06.867]  They can't believe that I say the things I say every day.
[03:49:06.867 --> 03:49:10.790]  They can't imagine that someone could be real and have courage.
[03:49:10.790 --> 03:49:12.191]  Why don't you have courage?
[03:49:12.191 --> 03:49:14.053]  The courage to protect your family.
[03:49:14.053 --> 03:49:16.195]  The courage to stand up against evil.
[03:49:16.195 --> 03:49:17.716]  I can't even control myself!
[03:49:17.716 --> 03:49:18.777]  It's not even courage!
[03:49:18.777 --> 03:49:19.558]  I can't shut up!
[03:49:22.537 --> 03:49:23.678]  Because I know where this leads.
[03:49:23.678 --> 03:49:28.302]  I know these bankers funded every mass murder in the last hundred years.
[03:49:28.302 --> 03:49:32.886]  Government mass murder.
[03:49:32.886 --> 03:49:36.509]  The good news is most people that work for the system are not evil consciously.
[03:49:36.509 --> 03:49:37.530]  They've been compartmentalized.
[03:49:37.530 --> 03:49:38.310]  They've been brainwashed.
[03:49:38.310 --> 03:49:39.391]  They've been dumbed down.
[03:49:39.391 --> 03:49:41.373]  And we're deprogramming them together.
[03:49:41.373 --> 03:49:43.034]  We're just showing people the bigger picture.
[03:49:43.034 --> 03:49:44.215]  How to think for themselves.
[03:49:44.215 --> 03:49:45.677]  How to look outside the box.
[03:49:45.677 --> 03:49:46.778]  We're having an effect.
[03:49:47.947 --> 03:49:49.809]  A real effect!
[03:49:49.809 --> 03:49:51.271]  And we can't be bought off.
[03:49:51.271 --> 03:49:53.173]  We can't be controlled.
[03:49:53.173 --> 03:49:54.634]  We can't be manipulated.
[03:49:54.634 --> 03:49:55.976]  We make mistakes, but we learn.
[03:49:55.976 --> 03:49:56.877]  We get smarter.
[03:49:56.877 --> 03:50:00.040]  And we're teaching others how to take action.
[03:50:00.040 --> 03:50:04.625]  And so the system is deathly afraid.
[03:50:04.625 --> 03:50:07.669]  They're deathly afraid because CNN quoted some book
[03:50:08.663 --> 03:50:10.184]  In fact, give me that print-off, Jaren.
[03:50:10.184 --> 03:50:15.906]  And the book quote about myself and others is how, you know, how the nuts are hijacking America.
[03:50:15.906 --> 03:50:20.808]  See, that's what Cass Sunstein says in his internal documents.
[03:50:20.808 --> 03:50:22.909]  Yeah, he has a Wingnut of the Week segment on CNN.
[03:50:22.909 --> 03:50:27.491]  I guess that's who they're going to give endless minutes to talk bad about me and then I get 30 seconds.
[03:50:27.491 --> 03:50:30.692]  It was another sheet where it said how the nuts are hijacking America.
[03:50:32.751 --> 03:50:38.793]  No, you're engaged in tyranny, and people are finally waking up to the full horror of it, and the denial is ending.
[03:50:38.793 --> 03:50:40.653]  And that's why you're scared.
[03:50:40.653 --> 03:50:41.834]  Now here it is.
[03:50:41.834 --> 03:50:44.674]  Wingnuts on a lunatic fringe is hijacking America.
[03:50:44.674 --> 03:50:49.136]  No, you've hijacked America, and we're getting ready to kick your butts out of here.
[03:50:49.136 --> 03:50:51.656]  You got that, you scum?
[03:50:51.656 --> 03:50:52.857]  You don't control our minds.
[03:50:52.857 --> 03:50:54.257]  You don't tell us what to think anymore.
[03:50:55.134 --> 03:51:02.357]  Did you know that there are tiny hidden radio transmitters, also known as RFID chips, in millions of passports, credit cards, and licenses?
[03:51:02.357 --> 03:51:06.299]  In the current state of the economy, it's no surprise that identity theft has increased.
[03:51:06.299 --> 03:51:14.623]  With current technology, thieves can purchase a simple device online that allows them to steal your credit card number and other personal information by scanning your wallet or purse.
[03:51:14.623 --> 03:51:17.524]  Think of this identity theft device as a garage door opener.
[03:51:17.524 --> 03:51:20.025]  You push a button and within a certain distance your door opens.
[03:51:20.305 --> 03:51:24.748]  Thieves get near you, push a button and these tiny radios give out personal information.
[03:51:24.748 --> 03:51:26.389]  Put a stop to identity theft.
[03:51:26.389 --> 03:51:28.490]  Visit IDStronghold.com.
[03:51:28.490 --> 03:51:31.232]  Here you will find radio blocking secure sleeves.

[03:51:42.739 --> 03:51:46.521]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:51:46.521 --> 03:51:48.262]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:51:48.262 --> 03:51:49.423]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:52:05.450 --> 03:52:08.111]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:08.111 --> 03:52:14.512]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:14.512 --> 03:52:20.053]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:20.053 --> 03:52:29.695]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:29.815 --> 03:52:32.156]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:32.156 --> 03:52:33.737]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:33.737 --> 03:52:36.198]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:36.198 --> 03:52:38.339]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:38.339 --> 03:52:43.481]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[03:53:52.741 --> 03:53:58.945]  The best you can buy.
[03:53:58.945 --> 03:54:04.188]  Sarah Palin is stumping for John McCain who wants global warming taxes.
[03:54:04.188 --> 03:54:06.150]  The guy that she says censored her.
[03:54:09.144 --> 03:54:15.589]  Sarah Palin's a joke, folks, and they're going to use her and build her up to discredit true constitutionalists.
[03:54:15.589 --> 03:54:18.892]  You have been warned.
[03:54:18.892 --> 03:54:20.974]  By the way, one of the shipping guys just came in.
[03:54:20.974 --> 03:54:29.580]  Netflix has accepted the Obama Deception, so now you can download it at Netflix or get the DVD shipped to you for folks that haven't seen the Obama Deception.
[03:54:29.580 --> 03:54:31.982]  You can get it through Netflix now.
[03:54:31.982 --> 03:54:33.744]  Again, the Obama Deception at Netflix.
[03:54:36.872 --> 03:54:39.815]  They're doing a test run right now to decide how many they're going to order.
[03:54:39.815 --> 03:54:44.479]  So it's important for folks to order it so they get even more and then advertise it to their people.
[03:54:44.479 --> 03:54:46.661]  Another way to wake people up.
[03:54:46.661 --> 03:54:52.207]  You know, I said I'd go to some more calls and I guess I'll jam in a few here at the end.
[03:54:52.207 --> 03:54:57.071]  We'll see what happens with this Anderson Cooper thing.
[03:54:57.071 --> 03:55:00.895]  It turns out the guy that called me is the guy that does this kook piece.
[03:55:02.483 --> 03:55:04.004]  Every week.
[03:55:04.004 --> 03:55:08.567]  And that was the guy kind of giggling in the background, John Avalon.
[03:55:08.567 --> 03:55:11.369]  And so just a completely biased piece.
[03:55:11.369 --> 03:55:15.472]  Wingnuts, how the lunatic fringe is hijacking America.
[03:55:15.472 --> 03:55:16.953]  But don't worry, their bias is okay.
[03:55:16.953 --> 03:55:20.975]  They're just going to shut down anybody that disagrees with the government with the Fairness Doctrine.
[03:55:20.975 --> 03:55:27.760]  But he can say I'm a wingnut and they're going to try to blame me for what's happening when it's their bosses that are causing this.
[03:55:28.717 --> 03:55:30.537]  Truly sickening.
[03:55:30.537 --> 03:55:36.819]  So we'll see what happens with that show tonight.
[03:55:36.819 --> 03:55:38.199]  Let's go to Bobby in Tennessee.
[03:55:38.199 --> 03:55:39.039]  Bobby, you're on the air.
[03:55:39.039 --> 03:55:40.860]  Hi.
[03:55:40.860 --> 03:55:43.720]  I just wanted to say I'll be praying for you tonight.
[03:55:43.720 --> 03:55:45.821]  I know it's going to be a lot.
[03:55:45.821 --> 03:55:51.742]  Well, it's not going on the stinking show and talking to some little chicken neck that's a problem.
[03:55:51.742 --> 03:55:55.263]  It's the fact that they're now saying Alex Jones is the evil one.
[03:55:57.148 --> 03:56:03.614]  Well, I'm just going to say, you know, just keep plugging your website and your shows and everything.
[03:56:03.614 --> 03:56:07.597]  I also wanted to talk to you about a way to wake up people.
[03:56:07.597 --> 03:56:10.539]  What I've been doing is I got your iPhone radio app.
[03:56:10.539 --> 03:56:21.369]  I don't know if anybody's brought this up, but I turn it on when I'm going to the bank, when I'm going to the grocery store, and I just let it play and people come up and ask me, you know, who is this?
[03:56:22.410 --> 03:56:24.131]  Um, you know, what is he talking about?
[03:56:24.131 --> 03:56:26.052]  So, that's a good way to wake up some people.
[03:56:42.827 --> 03:56:49.270]  And all I'm doing is reading Bloomberg, where the government's going to take over people's pension funds and invest it in failed banks.
[03:56:49.270 --> 03:56:50.090]  That's their own words.
[03:56:50.090 --> 03:56:52.631]  I'm going, does that sound like a good idea?
[03:56:52.631 --> 03:56:53.732]  And that scares them.
[03:56:53.732 --> 03:56:55.213]  He's saying it's criminal.
[03:56:55.213 --> 03:56:57.674]  Oh, he's evil.
[03:56:57.674 --> 03:56:59.094]  Bobby, I appreciate you.
[03:56:59.094 --> 03:56:59.775]  Go ahead.
[03:56:59.775 --> 03:57:03.316]  There's a lot of people that are waking up, but they're trying to hit the snooze button.
[03:57:03.316 --> 03:57:11.620]  And if we don't do anything, you know, something right now, you know, I'm afraid that, you know, they'll keep pushing what they're pushing and
[03:57:12.463 --> 03:57:21.480]  Even Glenn Beck was saying last night, you know, your children and your grandchildren are going to be saying, where were you when, you know, this went down?
[03:57:22.634 --> 03:57:26.538]  Yeah, Glenn Beck tries to get people's confidence so he can later double back on them.
[03:57:26.538 --> 03:57:28.139]  But, you know, I'll say this.
[03:57:28.139 --> 03:57:37.307]  I've been watching some, and he talks about George Washington and collectivist and, I mean, he's, I mean, they're letting him get on a longer and longer leash, and I, you know, so is Limbaugh.
[03:57:37.307 --> 03:57:43.352]  And the fact that this is all being forced out in the mainstream, and that is the mainstream, Fox has more viewers than all the other
[03:57:44.173 --> 03:57:47.036]  Cable networks combined and that's why CNN's a joke.
[03:57:47.036 --> 03:57:48.778]  It's why MSNBC's a joke.
[03:57:48.778 --> 03:57:51.601]  They're legends in their own mind.
[03:57:51.601 --> 03:57:52.181]  God bless you.
[03:57:52.181 --> 03:57:52.922]  I appreciate your call.
[03:57:52.922 --> 03:57:56.306]  I'm sorry to Randy, Doug, Rocco, Ron, Nicholas.

[03:57:59.489 --> 03:57:59.890]  Central.
[03:58:00.450 --> 03:58:01.110]  We're good to go.
[03:58:17.110 --> 03:58:22.994]  The fact that more and more stations are picking us up shows that this information is becoming mainline.
[03:58:22.994 --> 03:58:29.638]  We are shifting the paradigm from unreality to reality, and the system doesn't like it.
[03:58:29.638 --> 03:58:30.959]  I'm Alex Jones signing off.
[03:58:30.959 --> 03:58:32.180]  Retransmission starts now.

[03:58:45.216 --> 03:58:48.237]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:58:48.237 --> 03:58:53.559]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:58:53.559 --> 03:58:55.600]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:58:55.600 --> 03:59:00.601]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:59:00.601 --> 03:59:01.802]  How much do you want?
[03:59:01.802 --> 03:59:02.922]  When do you want it?
[03:59:02.922 --> 03:59:04.803]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:59:04.803 --> 03:59:05.883]  When will you need it?
[03:59:05.883 --> 03:59:08.084]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:59:08.084 --> 03:59:09.425]  Will there be any food?
[03:59:09.425 --> 03:59:10.725]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:59:10.945 --> 03:59:16.212]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:59:16.212 --> 03:59:19.797]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:59:19.797 --> 03:59:23.622]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:59:23.622 --> 03:59:24.844]  How much will you need?
[03:59:24.844 --> 03:59:25.745]  We don't know.
[03:59:25.745 --> 03:59:26.846]  How much do you want?
[03:59:26.846 --> 03:59:27.587]  All you can get.
[03:59:27.587 --> 03:59:28.589]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:59:28.869 --> 03:59:31.910]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
