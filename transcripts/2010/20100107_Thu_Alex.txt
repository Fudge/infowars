[00:00:05.982 --> 00:00:06.602]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.283 --> 00:00:08.343]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.043 --> 00:00:10.144]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.804 --> 00:00:11.604]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.384 --> 00:00:13.305]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.325 --> 00:00:17.646]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.126 --> 00:00:22.168]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.118 --> 00:00:33.704]  A great example of how the truth can prevail if you just continue to put out the truth and have a long view of history.
[00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:36.366]  For 30 years, Congressman Ron Paul has fought
[00:00:37.743 --> 00:00:39.664]  He has exposed the private Federal Reserve.
[00:00:39.704 --> 00:00:42.905]  He's having victory there now, thanks to all the great supporters out there.
[00:00:43.286 --> 00:00:45.206]  He's now all over mainstream television.
[00:00:45.246 --> 00:00:52.209]  The New York Times, the LA Times, the Houston Chronicle say Ron Paul is right, you know, from outsider to mainline.
[00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.412]  And thank God he's been there telling the truth so that people now have a choice between collectivism, big government, and tyranny.
[00:00:58.712 --> 00:01:02.194]  He's with us for the next 30 minutes to talk about a host of issues.
[00:01:02.874 --> 00:01:05.875]  Congressman Ron Paul, out of the gates, our first interview with you of 2010.
[00:01:07.256 --> 00:01:08.958]  What do you think is most important right now?
[00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:16.004]  Well, the big issue is how much of our freedom we're going to have, you know, in the next year or two.
[00:01:16.024 --> 00:01:17.065]  Are we losing it?
[00:01:17.105 --> 00:01:26.973]  And I say we are, and that to me is the biggest issue because I have such confidence in free people that when we're free and left alone and allowed to keep the fruits of our labor, things take care of themselves.
[00:01:27.013 --> 00:01:28.875]  We can do a much better job than the government.
[00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:32.837]  But if you go more specifically, I would say there are two.
[00:01:33.017 --> 00:01:41.901]  One is, you know, our expanded involvement overseas, which poses a danger to us, physical danger, as well as the danger to the men that have to go over there.
[00:01:42.441 --> 00:01:47.463]  And then the next thing I would be most concerned about is what I think is going to happen to the economy.
[00:01:47.823 --> 00:01:54.206]  I don't think this has passed, as I think we're just barely into the correction, because they're doing everything
[00:01:54.346 --> 00:01:54.707]  Thank you.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.585]  Well, I want to go over that in some detail coming up in the interview, what's happening with all these expanded wars.
[00:02:07.446 --> 00:02:11.570]  But first off, secret healthcare conference going on this week.
[00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.054]  Obama had promised to put it on C-SPAN, but I don't know how he has the authority over Congress.
[00:02:16.455 --> 00:02:23.962]  But now Obama says, okay, one hour, kind of a staged event with talking points, the public can see that.
[00:02:24.583 --> 00:02:25.964]  Your take on that, Congressman?
[00:02:26.204 --> 00:02:32.030]  Well, it just shows the hypocrisy of the whole thing, what people say in campaigns and then what they do afterwards.
[00:02:32.571 --> 00:02:38.317]  But most of the time, the important things that come out of Washington are done in secret.
[00:02:38.637 --> 00:02:41.500]  I've known that ever since I've been in Washington.
[00:02:41.981 --> 00:02:44.563]  The conferences have always been very, very secretive.
[00:02:44.944 --> 00:02:48.668]  And I think one time in 1980, they had the Monetary Control Act come up.
[00:02:49.288 --> 00:02:54.052]  And the most important part of the bill came up in the conference.
[00:02:54.072 --> 00:02:55.153]  They stick it in the conference.
[00:02:55.553 --> 00:02:59.636]  Used to be, well, theoretically, the conference is supposed to bring the numbers together.
[00:03:00.016 --> 00:03:05.440]  If the House has 50 and the Senate has 100, you're supposed to agree on the compromise and go with 75.
[00:03:06.061 --> 00:03:11.465]  But the conference is where they do all the mischief, and that's where, you know, the big deals are made.
[00:03:11.885 --> 00:03:14.227]  When the conference report comes back to the House floor,
[00:03:15.047 --> 00:03:20.314]  It's usually brought back with a one-hour debate, no amendments, and most people think, oh, we fully discussed this.
[00:03:20.354 --> 00:03:21.756]  How did I vote for this before?
[00:03:21.776 --> 00:03:22.657]  Oh, I voted against this.
[00:03:22.737 --> 00:03:23.658]  I'll vote against it again.
[00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:26.882]  And so this is what's going on.
[00:03:26.942 --> 00:03:28.524]  I'm not surprised at all.
[00:03:29.105 --> 00:03:31.748]  They're never going to tell us exactly what's in there.
[00:03:32.208 --> 00:03:32.468]  I think.
[00:03:47.433 --> 00:03:49.995]  And we won't know for years exactly what happened.
[00:03:50.375 --> 00:04:02.082]  I know there's a lot of condemnation of people not reading those bills, and of course it's impossible to read them or understand them, but I don't think there is any one individual that could read both of those bills and know what's in it.
[00:04:02.502 --> 00:04:04.404]  You know, they're so bad.
[00:04:04.824 --> 00:04:14.470]  That's why any time you come upon a situation like this, any member of Congress ought to just vote no on it, because they know it's no good, and it's a fact that they
[00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.953]  You know, do it in secret means that you can't trust what they're doing.
[00:04:19.394 --> 00:04:26.139]  It's over 4,000 pages with both versions and jail time and new taxes and cutting benefits.
[00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:33.645]  Even socialists like Dennis Kucinich in the house with you and even the head of the Democratic Party have said it's not a good bill.
[00:04:34.716 --> 00:04:40.979]  No, and the left, there may be some on the left that will oppose it, but they'll probably only oppose it because there's not enough government.
[00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:48.542]  And fortunately, you know, the Republicans are doing a better job of sticking together on this.
[00:04:49.382 --> 00:04:52.124]  You know, if Bush were president, that wouldn't be the case.
[00:04:52.324 --> 00:04:55.105]  We'd be getting some more prescription drug programs.
[00:04:55.165 --> 00:04:58.686]  So right now, the Republicans are sticking together and opposing it.
[00:04:58.726 --> 00:04:59.127]  Stay there.
[00:04:59.447 --> 00:05:00.147]  We can stop it.
[00:05:00.638 --> 00:05:00.838]  Great!
[00:05:00.938 --> 00:05:05.159]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:06.100]  Number one.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.541]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:09.821 --> 00:05:10.361]  Number two.
[00:05:10.681 --> 00:05:15.222]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:15.562 --> 00:05:16.023]  It's true.
[00:05:16.303 --> 00:05:20.864]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:21.184 --> 00:05:21.724]  Number 3.
[00:05:22.004 --> 00:05:25.285]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:25.585 --> 00:05:29.326]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:29.506 --> 00:05:30.046]  Number 4.
[00:05:30.286 --> 00:05:32.667]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:33.047 --> 00:05:36.448]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:36.728 --> 00:05:36.948]  Number 5.
[00:05:37.528 --> 00:05:41.449]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:46.430]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.755]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:06:01.328 --> 00:06:03.930]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.294]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:06:09.655 --> 00:06:11.416]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:06:11.716 --> 00:06:16.520]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.621]  How much do you want?
[00:06:17.881 --> 00:06:18.642]  When do you want it?
[00:06:19.002 --> 00:06:20.603]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:06:20.903 --> 00:06:21.724]  When will you need it?
[00:06:21.964 --> 00:06:24.045]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:06:24.165 --> 00:06:25.286]  Will there be any food?
[00:06:25.506 --> 00:06:26.847]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:06:27.047 --> 00:06:32.111]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:06:32.311 --> 00:06:35.493]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:06:35.893 --> 00:06:39.356]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:06:39.696 --> 00:06:40.696]  How much will you need?
[00:06:40.916 --> 00:06:41.536]  We don't know.
[00:06:41.837 --> 00:06:42.737]  How much do you want?
[00:06:42.937 --> 00:06:43.657]  All you can get.
[00:06:43.677 --> 00:06:44.717]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:06:44.957 --> 00:06:47.718]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:06:47.998 --> 00:06:49.759]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:50.699]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.610]  Hi, everyone.
[00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:02.650]  Andy Anderson here.
[00:07:02.851 --> 00:07:07.092]  Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria, and other nasties?
[00:07:07.252 --> 00:07:12.913]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day.
[00:07:13.033 --> 00:07:17.314]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, goodbye effectiveness?
[00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:19.095]  No more protection till you use it again.
[00:07:19.235 --> 00:07:20.415]  PureWorks to the rescue!
[00:07:20.595 --> 00:07:24.936]  Our FDA-compliant foam, lotion, soap, and spray do not contain alcohol.
[00:07:24.976 --> 00:07:27.037]  Their killing power lasts up to four hours.
[00:07:27.177 --> 00:07:40.220]  PureWorks Disinfecting Spray is EPA certified to kill swine flu, bird flu, MRSA, HIV, hepatitis B and C, and for our friends in medicine, kills C. diff, along with a whole host of viruses and bacteria, molds and fungus too.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.800]  It's even safe around pets and children.
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.962]  You'll love how your skin feels with PureWorks Soft and Supple.
[00:07:45.062 --> 00:07:46.083]  No more dry skin.
[00:07:46.243 --> 00:07:50.685]  Here's to a little peace of mind knowing that your hands are still germ-free hours later.
[00:07:50.826 --> 00:07:57.890]  Call now toll-free 888-245-0300 to get your hands on PureWorks and get PureWorks on your hands.
[00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:58.750]  That's 888-245-0300.
[00:07:58.891 --> 00:08:04.134]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.714 --> 00:08:07.476]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:27.374 --> 00:08:32.697]  Well, his new book's been out for months, been at the top of the bestseller charts in the Fed.
[00:08:33.978 --> 00:08:40.282]  And of course, he had a number one New York Times bestseller, his Manifesto of Freedom.
[00:08:40.862 --> 00:08:43.604]  And you can find out a lot more at Campaign for Liberty.
[00:08:44.344 --> 00:08:45.105]  Ron Paul.
[00:08:46.021 --> 00:08:50.282]  Yes, but I don't think anybody knows what will be in it.
[00:08:50.302 --> 00:08:52.963]  I don't think it will be everything that Obama wanted.
[00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:22.634]  I wouldn't put a whole lot of money on exactly what's going to happen, because, you know, the right-to-life people in the House are very, very determined.
[00:09:22.694 --> 00:09:28.296]  And Democrats, you know, Bart Stupak said he's going to stick to his guns, so maybe something good will come of all that.
[00:09:28.916 --> 00:09:32.078]  But then again, I think something will pass.
[00:09:32.138 --> 00:09:34.979]  The government is going to get more control of medical care.
[00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:43.002]  In every poll, you get gallop polls of 99% against the banker bailout takeover of 2008.
[00:09:44.503 --> 00:09:46.605]  You see 91% against open borders.
[00:09:46.645 --> 00:09:51.028]  You see 70-plus percent not wanting government-financed abortion.
[00:09:51.088 --> 00:09:54.830]  But it all just continues, even if the people are against it.
[00:09:56.271 --> 00:09:57.132]  Take Copenhagen.
[00:09:57.632 --> 00:10:07.576]  The Copenhagen, Denmark event, Congressman, as you know, they couldn't get the treaty, so Obama and Gordon Brown say they're just going to implement it at the executive level.
[00:10:07.636 --> 00:10:08.576]  Is this not tyranny?
[00:10:09.617 --> 00:10:13.078]  It is, and they do a lot of that, and they've been doing it for a lot of years.
[00:10:13.118 --> 00:10:17.800]  Executive orders, probably about 99% of those are illegal.
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.421]  There are some conditions where a president's allowed to issue an executive order.
[00:10:22.116 --> 00:10:30.040]  But you have the executive orders, you have the signing statements, and I mentioned before about how agencies of government legislate.
[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.501]  That's unconstitutional.
[00:10:32.001 --> 00:10:34.482]  And it's just growing by leaps and bounds.
[00:10:34.582 --> 00:10:42.086]  And when you think about what the CIA does and how we run our foreign policy, it's all out of control.
[00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:47.467]  And it seems from studying history that that's what tyrannies do.
[00:10:47.868 --> 00:10:50.771]  They just get you trained to accept corruption.
[00:10:51.372 --> 00:10:53.995]  No one is for it, but they just do it.
[00:10:54.015 --> 00:10:58.820]  And the people kind of get a broken mindset or broken attitude.
[00:11:00.081 --> 00:11:04.006]  I've seen polls in Europe of 76% against the naked body scanners.
[00:11:04.446 --> 00:11:08.111]  We have medical reports that it does bombard your body with dangerous radiation.
[00:11:09.372 --> 00:11:13.056]  The media blurs the images, but we've posted and gotten the real images.
[00:11:14.858 --> 00:11:17.940]  Images of women's breasts, genitalia, men's genitals.
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:21.402]  This is a literal recording of your naked body.
[00:11:21.882 --> 00:11:27.145]  England has to change their law, The Guardian reports, because it is child pornography under their laws.
[00:11:27.526 --> 00:11:32.188]  I mean, who would imagine Stalin putting people through naked body scanners?
[00:11:32.229 --> 00:11:34.910]  Congressman, can you speak to that A and B?
[00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:40.874]  Could you sponsor a bill to have Congress get control of the TSA?
[00:11:41.594 --> 00:11:48.320]  And not let them put in these machines, and we have Chertoff making money off the company that got the government contracts?
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.782]  I mean, this is just incredible conflicts of interest.
[00:11:51.122 --> 00:11:57.067]  We've already had a vote in the House on this, to ban these scanners, and it passed at the House.
[00:11:57.107 --> 00:12:00.050]  So, that represented what the people were saying.
[00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:01.611]  That was several months ago.
[00:12:02.192 --> 00:12:05.274]  But, it's almost like this is the reaction to it.
[00:12:05.314 --> 00:12:09.598]  We need to prove that we need these machines, and they have this incident come up.
[00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:17.159]  So, no, I think the people back then said one thing, but now they're using the tactic.
[00:12:17.739 --> 00:12:30.522]  You were wondering, why do the people, you know, go along, and even though it seems like they're opposed to it, I think the reason the people finally go along, even though their numbers are against it, is because of fear.
[00:12:30.542 --> 00:12:35.143]  I mean, the government knows how to build up fear, you know, fear of the financial collapse of the system.
[00:12:35.223 --> 00:12:36.964]  Oh yeah, that's why we have to bail everybody out.
[00:12:37.851 --> 00:12:45.417]  The fear that Osama bin Laden is on the verge of having a nuclear weapon and Saddam Hussein is going to bomb Washington, D.C.
[00:12:45.817 --> 00:12:54.183]  is always fear, fear, fear, and then the people get frightened, and then they sacrifice their liberties, and it's a continuous process.
[00:12:56.164 --> 00:13:00.167]  It's a hard thing to combat, but hopefully we'll be able to do it.
[00:13:00.848 --> 00:13:03.209]  So, carbon dioxide is going to kill us.
[00:13:03.249 --> 00:13:06.470]  We've got to have a world government and a world tax to save us.
[00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:08.371]  The swine flu is going to kill us.
[00:13:08.431 --> 00:13:14.553]  It's killed right around 11% so far, according to the Associated Press, what the regular seasonal flu does.
[00:13:14.833 --> 00:13:18.615]  But we've got to have those forced inoculations in New York and Massachusetts.
[00:13:18.655 --> 00:13:19.295]  That failed.
[00:13:19.735 --> 00:13:27.118]  It does seem that their selling of fear, though, is having less and less effect, and that people are starting to get wise to it.
[00:13:27.386 --> 00:13:28.147]  Yeah, this is it.
[00:13:28.227 --> 00:13:31.409]  And this is the great thing that's happened, is the loss of credibility of government.
[00:13:31.909 --> 00:13:42.977]  And this comes along with the acknowledgement that the government is bankrupt, and that both parties are bankrupt, because governments make promises and they can't fulfill them.
[00:13:43.218 --> 00:13:48.882]  Even these foreign policy adventures, adventurism, that's not going to pan out either.
[00:13:48.922 --> 00:13:50.663]  There will be a point where you can't afford it.
[00:13:50.683 --> 00:13:51.844]  That's why the Soviets left.
[00:13:51.904 --> 00:13:53.005]  It isn't because we fought them.
[00:13:53.365 --> 00:13:55.687]  They finally, the economic system couldn't be sustained.
[00:13:56.327 --> 00:14:05.650]  And there's as much concern on the left as there is on the right about government and its credibility, because the people on the left say, hey, maybe my benefits aren't going to come.
[00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:08.230]  Is it true that Social Security is bankrupt?
[00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:11.731]  And where are they going to get this money for all this medical bill?
[00:14:12.031 --> 00:14:14.072]  You know, eventually they're starting to wake up.
[00:14:14.372 --> 00:14:19.115]  Because government is losing their credibility, and I think this is very, very healthy.
[00:14:19.535 --> 00:14:26.240]  But our job is not just to harp on their total failure, as much as to say, what are we going to do about it?
[00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:27.481]  Is there an answer to this?
[00:14:27.801 --> 00:14:35.026]  And this is where, when I talk on college campuses, they're delighted to hear that there are alternatives, there are things to do.
[00:14:35.406 --> 00:14:36.987]  And I am convinced in my own mind.
[00:14:37.719 --> 00:14:46.393]  If we had truly a free society of sound money and limited government and sensible foreign policy and we just got out of the way and everybody got
[00:14:47.185 --> 00:14:51.146]  You know, lost 75% of their wealth tomorrow, but they were left alone.
[00:14:51.686 --> 00:14:56.007]  I think we'd recover quickly, quicker than anybody would ever dream of.
[00:14:56.347 --> 00:15:05.809]  So the whole issue is how free we can be and whether we can have self-reliance and take care of ourselves and push us back to depending on local communities and family.
[00:15:06.189 --> 00:15:13.150]  It is so remarkable how successful that is, but unfortunately our country has lost confidence in that.
[00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:15.552]  But now the question is being asked.
[00:15:15.632 --> 00:15:18.434]  If government can't deliver, what is the option?
[00:15:18.754 --> 00:15:24.739]  Too often, though, they're saying, you know, the people that you fight all the time are the one-world people.
[00:15:25.199 --> 00:15:27.401]  Oh yes, there is a crisis, a financial crisis.
[00:15:27.741 --> 00:15:33.346]  That means we need a single central bank for the whole world.
[00:15:33.746 --> 00:15:42.513]  But the other option is maybe introducing the notion of gold and silver coinage here in the United States, like the Constitution mandates.
[00:15:44.076 --> 00:15:50.781]  Congressman, a few minutes ago you alluded to the fact that they couldn't get their multi-billion dollar airport scanners in.
[00:15:50.841 --> 00:15:52.442]  People were refusing en masse.
[00:15:53.383 --> 00:15:57.767]  And so magically, Christmas Day, I heard on the radio about the underwear bomber.
[00:15:59.085 --> 00:16:00.266]  And then I talked to eyewitnesses.
[00:16:00.306 --> 00:16:01.527]  They didn't hear an explosion.
[00:16:01.567 --> 00:16:03.368]  They saw another man on board the flight.
[00:16:03.789 --> 00:16:08.213]  They saw a man lead the underwear bomber onto the flight in Amsterdam.
[00:16:09.254 --> 00:16:11.436]  They had body scanners in Amsterdam.
[00:16:11.696 --> 00:16:13.017]  He bypassed security.
[00:16:13.538 --> 00:16:19.363]  The underwear bomber's father said he was training in Yemen, but he wasn't put on the watch list.
[00:16:19.784 --> 00:16:20.825]  On and on and on.
[00:16:20.845 --> 00:16:22.726]  And you talk about
[00:16:23.587 --> 00:16:27.188]  Letting this happen, or how convenient that this came along.
[00:16:27.448 --> 00:16:37.310]  Even Rush Limbaugh now admits there's a global government forming, and he admits that the government wants to wreck society so that we all become dependent on them.
[00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:47.253]  So the good news is, mainline conservatives are now finally having to admit what you've been talking about for 20, 30 years, what I've been talking about for 14 years, but can you speak to
[00:16:47.893 --> 00:16:53.397]  Creating crises, or using existing crises, or letting terrorists hit us.
[00:16:54.458 --> 00:16:57.340]  Gulf of Tonkin was staged, never happened.
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:01.243]  53 overthrowing Iran by funding radical Muslims to attack the government.
[00:17:01.844 --> 00:17:09.950]  I mean, we know who has the motive in all of this, and within minutes of the underwear bombing report Sunday, it came on Fox News Radio.
[00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:15.534]  I was listening with my family on Christmas, and they said, don't worry, the scanners are going in next month.
[00:17:15.674 --> 00:17:17.676]  I mean, you talk about perfect timing.
[00:17:18.856 --> 00:17:31.661]  Yeah, and the question is whether or not government could be that inept, and sometimes I think they're quite capable of being very inept rather than just conspiracy people who have planned every single thing.
[00:17:31.721 --> 00:17:38.463]  But there are events that occur and they make good use of them, but really, can they be this inept?
[00:17:38.923 --> 00:17:45.826]  You know, it just seems like they can't be that stupid who missed so many warning signs.
[00:17:47.406 --> 00:17:56.233]  And I've been harping on this, is that every year we spend $75 billion on gathering intelligence to try to protect our country from being hit.
[00:17:56.253 --> 00:17:58.714]  Of course, they won't talk about foreign policy.
[00:17:59.075 --> 00:18:00.516]  Then they get this hot lead.
[00:18:00.556 --> 00:18:02.177]  They say, oh yeah, we knew about that guy.
[00:18:02.217 --> 00:18:03.258]  We were warned about him.
[00:18:03.798 --> 00:18:05.840]  And it wouldn't have cost—what would it have cost?
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.481]  The cost of a telephone call?
[00:18:08.341 --> 00:18:10.222]  And say, you know, why don't you watch this guy?
[00:18:10.242 --> 00:18:16.483]  You know, but where does the $75 billion go to collect all this intelligence?
[00:18:16.963 --> 00:18:29.666]  It seems to me like we don't have very many intelligent people analyzing this unless somebody's in the business of allowing these things to go forward, which is going to be hard to prove one way or the other.
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.581]  Well, my issue is this.
[00:18:32.641 --> 00:18:35.723]  Let's say there's real terrorists that blow up a few airlines every year.
[00:18:36.263 --> 00:18:42.768]  I would rather, and I've seen the polls, so would everybody else, walk right onto those planes and have the chance that that's going to happen.
[00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:44.229]  I mean, I get on the highway every day.
[00:18:44.489 --> 00:18:45.870]  That's the number one cause of death.
[00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:50.653]  I take my children down the highway at 70 miles an hour with big 18-wheelers right beside me.
[00:18:51.093 --> 00:18:55.997]  I routinely, yesterday, drove past an overturned 18-wheeler that was a fatality.
[00:18:57.938 --> 00:19:01.720]  Do I suddenly start chewing my fingernails and say, naked body scan me?
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.982]  You know, record my naked children in the body scanner?
[00:19:05.002 --> 00:19:06.563]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:19:07.123 --> 00:19:11.745]  That may be logical, but it won't pass politically to take that.
[00:19:12.226 --> 00:19:15.868]  They will consider this that you're not really concerned.
[00:19:16.268 --> 00:19:23.852]  But what I do instead, even though I'm not saying that what you're saying is wrong, what I'm saying is that there's an alternative.
[00:19:24.052 --> 00:19:26.273]  I don't believe the government should be involved in giving us our
[00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:30.836]  Privacy or, you know, our safety.
[00:19:30.856 --> 00:19:39.600]  And the government doesn't give us our safety in our houses, or our building, or our farms, or, you know, our business establishment, or our chemical plant.
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:52.146]  But, you know, on the airplanes, if the airlines were responsible, there is technology available now that every individual could be issued something no bigger than a cell phone, and it would be your identification badge.
[00:19:53.078 --> 00:19:56.720]  The airline can have that registered.
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:02.304]  So they say, oh, I know your little gadget there belongs to Ron Paul, so I want you to put your fingerprint on it.
[00:20:02.344 --> 00:20:05.185]  You put your fingerprint on it, and they get the recording.
[00:20:05.225 --> 00:20:08.047]  They have no record of your fingerprint, no records kept.
[00:20:08.087 --> 00:20:09.768]  The government doesn't know anything about it.
[00:20:10.128 --> 00:20:13.310]  But I'm a frequent flyer, but I have my passport.
[00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:17.232]  You know, I have a card, which I have voluntarily gotten.
[00:20:17.513 --> 00:20:18.733]  It's a corporate passport!
[00:20:20.094 --> 00:20:20.595]  We're good.
[00:20:36.473 --> 00:20:38.815]  But Congressman, we know what's really happening.
[00:20:39.095 --> 00:20:40.576]  Take Austin, Texas.
[00:20:40.956 --> 00:20:47.240]  $150 million spent on Capital Metro that 1% of the city rides at a cost over $35 per ride.
[00:20:47.481 --> 00:20:48.181]  The person pays $2.
[00:20:48.821 --> 00:20:50.943]  And $70 million is spent on Austin Roads.
[00:20:51.343 --> 00:21:01.990]  So more than double the money is spent because the government gets to control the buses than what all the rest of the people are using cars.
[00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:02.911]  They only get
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:06.081]  Yeah, there's no doubt about it.
[00:21:06.121 --> 00:21:08.663]  When I heard that thing about Chernoff, it's hard to believe.
[00:21:08.703 --> 00:21:10.625]  Somebody was interviewing him, like, oh...
[00:21:27.017 --> 00:21:31.938]  By the way, I know you run this, and how did you guys know that this was so important?
[00:21:31.978 --> 00:21:35.059]  It was like, he was really smart that he figured this out.
[00:21:35.119 --> 00:21:38.840]  It wasn't like, is there a conflict of interest?
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.180]  That question never even came up when he was being interviewed.
[00:21:41.821 --> 00:21:49.722]  Well, that's like in Congress, whenever Paulson, the head of the Treasury, they'd say, well, you got tens of millions of dollars of your own bailout money, and he'd say, I gave myself a waiver.
[00:21:49.742 --> 00:21:52.763]  Yeah, and made it legal, huh?
[00:21:53.143 --> 00:21:56.264]  I mean, can I give myself a waiver, Congressman, to rob banks?
[00:21:56.923 --> 00:22:03.547]  You know, they gave that, I can't remember which company it was, but they were bankrupt and we bailed them out and all, and they still had a tax problem.
[00:22:03.607 --> 00:22:07.430]  So they just wrote the taxes off, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:12.453]  Oh, OK, those last three years taxes, you had a lot of trouble, so you don't have to pay those taxes.
[00:22:12.694 --> 00:22:18.537]  Can you imagine if you had a tax problem and you had difficulty with the IRS?
[00:22:18.898 --> 00:22:23.201]  Well, we know you had trouble, so you don't have to pay those back taxes.
[00:22:23.601 --> 00:22:26.803]  But that's the way the system works, unfortunately.
[00:22:27.363 --> 00:22:30.866]  Dr. Ron Paul, Congressman Ron Paul joining us, got about eight minutes left here.
[00:22:30.966 --> 00:22:38.433]  Sir, I saw a Bloomberg report where Goldman Sachs is arming its employees literally against the public with pitchforks.
[00:22:40.555 --> 00:22:43.936]  In Washington, are they starting to get the same sense that Wall Street is?
[00:22:44.356 --> 00:22:51.418]  That the people are recognizing their criminal activity, passing unconstitutional bills without even reading it?
[00:22:51.978 --> 00:22:54.819]  Because it seems that Washington's only getting more criminal.
[00:22:55.059 --> 00:22:56.080]  They don't seem to care.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.161]  Or is it more like rats running off the sinking ship with the loot?
[00:23:00.734 --> 00:23:02.096]  Well, there's some of that.
[00:23:02.997 --> 00:23:09.066]  I work on the assumption that Washington is usually about 10, 15 years behind what the people are thinking.
[00:23:09.086 --> 00:23:15.595]  So I don't think a person like Nancy Pelosi is aware of what the people are really thinking.
[00:23:15.935 --> 00:23:17.217]  You know, if she heard about the
[00:23:18.298 --> 00:23:18.619]  I don't
[00:23:37.879 --> 00:23:43.622]  The real changes are occurring and of course I'm always hopeful that there's some real changes with the young people.
[00:23:43.742 --> 00:23:47.985]  So that's why I keep talking to myself so that I'm always hopeful.
[00:23:50.003 --> 00:23:57.109]  Speaking of hopefulness, Iceland, it looks like, may say, no, we're not going to pay off private debt.
[00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:00.832]  England is listing all Icelanders basically as terrorists.
[00:24:00.872 --> 00:24:03.975]  They can grab and hold the money that's in British banks.
[00:24:05.636 --> 00:24:08.158]  Goldman Sachs has been caught engineering that crisis.
[00:24:08.198 --> 00:24:09.239]  That's come out in the news.
[00:24:09.259 --> 00:24:14.364]  I mean, shouldn't we just tell these private banks, we're not going to give you any more bailout money?
[00:24:15.376 --> 00:24:19.579]  Well, we should have never given it in the first place, and we shouldn't give any more.
[00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.982]  Besides, pretty soon it'll be worthless and won't matter much.
[00:24:24.022 --> 00:24:26.604]  So, the more you give away, create money out of thin air.
[00:24:26.624 --> 00:24:32.929]  The more you give away, you may temporarily help some of their friends, but it's just more of the same thing.
[00:24:33.049 --> 00:24:36.051]  That's how we got into this trouble, and that's how they're going to keep it going.
[00:24:37.026 --> 00:24:43.053]  A lot of economists are saying we could have total depression within the next year, the real economy over 20% unemployment.
[00:24:43.453 --> 00:24:45.755]  All the numbers that I know you're well aware of are really bad.
[00:24:46.016 --> 00:24:56.947]  While the mainstream media says this is a great economy because the big banks are making money off the bailout, the dollars continuing its slide went up for a little bit, but still overall it's going down.
[00:24:57.648 --> 00:24:59.550]  Where do you see us in two years, Congressman?
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:02.961]  I think we're going to be much poorer as a nation.
[00:25:03.062 --> 00:25:05.183]  I think unemployment rates are going to stay very high.
[00:25:05.203 --> 00:25:09.045]  I think by two years it'll be acknowledged that there was no recovery.
[00:25:09.665 --> 00:25:15.429]  I thought there were some very good articles, and I commented on one this past week about Paul Krugman.
[00:25:15.905 --> 00:25:19.587]  You know, he analyzed the past 10 years, and he had a good analysis.
[00:25:19.607 --> 00:25:20.847]  We're all worse off.
[00:25:21.468 --> 00:25:26.430]  Real income has not gone up, and investments have not gone up.
[00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:31.713]  He did say that you'd be even-steven on your stocks from 10 years ago, but you're actually lower.
[00:25:31.753 --> 00:25:34.974]  If you take into account the inflation, you're down about 20%.
[00:25:36.255 --> 00:25:42.801]  But, of course, he said what we needed was more spending and more regulations, and that would have solved all that problem.
[00:25:43.221 --> 00:25:46.024]  But, no, I think it started ten years ago.
[00:25:46.044 --> 00:25:49.366]  I think we started slipping into the recession, depression.
[00:25:49.386 --> 00:25:53.570]  I think there's no sign that we have reversed things.
[00:25:55.472 --> 00:25:58.294]  They talk themselves into thinking that things are improving.
[00:25:58.795 --> 00:26:03.799]  When the dot-com bubble burst, they didn't allow the correction to occur, so they created a housing bubble.
[00:26:04.259 --> 00:26:07.401]  Well, they started feeling better, but that didn't solve the problem.
[00:26:07.441 --> 00:26:09.622]  Now a lot of people don't have houses.
[00:26:10.343 --> 00:26:12.164]  But you don't believe gold is a bubble?
[00:26:13.365 --> 00:26:14.686]  No, I don't believe that.
[00:26:15.046 --> 00:26:16.827]  So that's an inflationary issue?
[00:26:16.967 --> 00:26:25.652]  I think gold reflects, if anything, it's way behind because the bubble is the size of the dollars created.
[00:26:25.692 --> 00:26:32.737]  The real bubble, I think, is in the bond market because the price of bonds are so good because the interest rates are so low.
[00:26:33.537 --> 00:26:36.398]  But that's just being held together.
[00:26:36.418 --> 00:26:41.960]  I think this is what the Fed does in collusion with other central banks as they prop that market up.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.301]  So if gold met inflation, what would it be like?
[00:26:45.321 --> 00:26:45.621]  $2,500 an ounce?
[00:26:50.933 --> 00:26:52.395]  It would be a lot higher.
[00:26:52.415 --> 00:26:57.862]  I don't think the market's been allowed to adjust to that yet.
[00:26:58.483 --> 00:27:03.209]  That's the other thing that an audit might reveal, is how much they're involved in the gold market.
[00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:08.796]  The governments have always been involved in gold, even when they had gold in
[00:27:09.136 --> 00:27:09.576]  Absolutely.
[00:27:28.331 --> 00:27:29.652]  They're working very hard.
[00:27:29.752 --> 00:27:33.413]  They know that a high price of gold is a vote against paper.
[00:27:34.034 --> 00:27:42.177]  They can't allow the people to question the paper money, because their kingdom is finished when the people question it.
[00:27:42.658 --> 00:27:44.238]  They're only beginning to question it.
[00:27:44.298 --> 00:27:48.360]  So, if anything, gold is a long way from a bubble.
[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:50.041]  The real bubble is in the
[00:27:51.222 --> 00:27:58.008]  Congressman, I totally agree with you.
[00:27:58.528 --> 00:28:00.270]  In the last minute and a half, we've got left.
[00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:06.795]  Homeschoolers in California, they ruled a couple years ago that homeschooling's a privilege, that the state owns their children.
[00:28:06.815 --> 00:28:07.736]  That got overturned.
[00:28:08.077 --> 00:28:09.298]  CBS News reports,
[00:28:09.778 --> 00:28:12.240]  These people moved to the town, didn't register their kids.
[00:28:12.661 --> 00:28:13.842]  It was a civil matter.
[00:28:14.542 --> 00:28:17.885]  But the CPS said, yeah, but that's child endangerment.
[00:28:18.185 --> 00:28:20.607]  And so they were arrested through color of law.
[00:28:21.308 --> 00:28:25.111]  And the school is on television saying they deserve to go to jail.
[00:28:25.772 --> 00:28:28.034]  I mean, this is slavery in my view.
[00:28:28.234 --> 00:28:32.558]  I mean, if we can't raise our children and be left alone by the state, we might as well be the Soviet Union.
[00:28:33.198 --> 00:28:43.789]  This is Tierney, but unfortunately we sold that out a long time ago when we decided the federal government was involved in education, always, you know, for these good reasons.
[00:28:43.849 --> 00:28:49.134]  So once we allowed the government to take charge of it, you know, there's been some up and downs.
[00:28:49.174 --> 00:28:52.257]  They tried to really stop homeschooling in the early 80s.
[00:28:53.378 --> 00:28:58.182]  And there was some court fights and we won those, but no, they will never give up on that.
[00:28:58.203 --> 00:28:59.744]  They never give up on control of money.
[00:28:59.764 --> 00:29:04.168]  They will never give up on the control of the education of the young children.
[00:29:04.188 --> 00:29:10.073]  Just think of how they brainwash young children on global warming and some of this radical environmentalism.
[00:29:10.653 --> 00:29:21.803]  So that's a big fight, but hopefully it'll backfire on them and it'll just wake the people up, because there's sure a lot of homeschoolers around these days, and they're very strong on the Constitution.
[00:29:21.843 --> 00:29:25.446]  They've learned the Constitution, which they would never have learned in the public schools.
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:26.740]  That's right.
[00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:29.241]  There's many more homeschoolers now than there were in the 80s.
[00:29:29.301 --> 00:29:30.462]  We beat them back then.
[00:29:30.562 --> 00:29:35.524]  The message is, stand up against this tyranny and we can turn them around.
[00:29:35.924 --> 00:29:39.205]  Congressman Ron Paul, thank you so much for joining us in the new year.
[00:29:39.585 --> 00:29:41.206]  Everybody should get your book In the Fed.
[00:29:41.286 --> 00:29:43.086]  Our website's InfoWars.com.
[00:29:43.527 --> 00:29:45.027]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[00:29:45.247 --> 00:29:45.827]  Good to be with you.
[00:29:45.848 --> 00:29:46.168]  Bye-bye.
[00:29:46.528 --> 00:29:46.928]  Take care.
[00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:52.670]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:54.671]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.667 --> 00:29:58.376]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.882 --> 00:30:07.748]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:30:07.868 --> 00:30:09.130]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:09.810]  It's very real.
[00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:13.734]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[00:30:13.854 --> 00:30:18.178]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[00:30:18.338 --> 00:30:20.700]  Clean, great-tasting water without all the pollutants.
[00:30:20.901 --> 00:30:26.706]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.

[00:30:48.426 --> 00:30:48.666]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[00:30:48.686 --> 00:30:50.608]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[00:31:00.609 --> 00:31:04.852]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:05.152 --> 00:31:05.773]  Number one.
[00:31:06.073 --> 00:31:09.235]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:09.495 --> 00:31:10.076]  Number two.
[00:31:10.356 --> 00:31:14.919]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:15.700]  It's true.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.563]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:20.864 --> 00:31:21.324]  Number three.
[00:31:21.684 --> 00:31:24.967]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:25.267 --> 00:31:28.990]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:29.991 --> 00:31:32.352]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:32.733 --> 00:31:36.075]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:37.196 --> 00:31:41.119]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:41.339 --> 00:31:46.123]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:46.403 --> 00:31:50.426]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:50.586 --> 00:31:52.147]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:52.367 --> 00:31:56.971]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:32:02.264 --> 00:32:05.885]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:06.225 --> 00:32:14.346]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:32:15.086 --> 00:32:19.127]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:32:19.707 --> 00:32:30.529]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:32:31.169 --> 00:32:40.173]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:40.674 --> 00:32:45.736]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:32:46.116 --> 00:32:53.299]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.341]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:33:01.804 --> 00:33:04.006]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:33:04.566 --> 00:33:07.429]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:10.992 --> 00:33:17.637]  Okay, we're gonna go to your phone calls, Wilson, Melody, Frank, Jim, Michael, and others.
[00:33:17.717 --> 00:33:20.919]  And I'm gonna go over a ton of news we haven't even gotten to yet.
[00:33:20.939 --> 00:33:23.962]  I have a report here with airline security.
[00:33:24.022 --> 00:33:27.144]  The Fed's completely taking it over with the TSA.
[00:33:28.065 --> 00:33:29.947]  Unconstitutionally using it.
[00:33:31.155 --> 00:33:38.766]  As a microcosm, a cancer cell to spread out of the rest of society, their unconstitutional federal takeover.
[00:33:39.247 --> 00:33:42.832]  The feds themselves taken over by international interest, completely unconstitutional.
[00:33:43.353 --> 00:33:46.157]  Explosives reached Ireland after failed test.
[00:33:46.838 --> 00:33:55.881]  A quantity of explosive found in a flat on Dorset Street in Dublin this morning was brought into the country following a failed security operation in Slovakia.
[00:33:56.461 --> 00:34:01.903]  They planted bombs on somebody in their bags as a test and it went through.
[00:34:03.064 --> 00:34:05.444]  That's how the government stages terror attacks.
[00:34:05.484 --> 00:34:06.785]  They pick some Muslim
[00:34:08.163 --> 00:34:18.075]  Or somebody they don't like, normally with a criminal record so they look bad, and they just put bombs on the airplane with them and blow the airplane up, or bust them with it, and the person says, I have no idea.
[00:34:18.095 --> 00:34:21.799]  This is how they do it, over and over.
[00:34:21.859 --> 00:34:23.801]  That's how a false flag is run.
[00:34:24.242 --> 00:34:26.585]  That's one of their favorite ways to do it.
[00:34:27.834 --> 00:34:28.936]  And they could do it to me.
[00:34:29.676 --> 00:34:33.381]  They could plant a explosive on check bags.
[00:34:33.421 --> 00:34:35.263]  That's why I never check bags.
[00:34:35.944 --> 00:34:38.748]  And I fight with the airports and pay extra to carry two on.
[00:34:38.808 --> 00:34:40.930]  And they try to grab them and take them away.
[00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:45.636]  And almost every time I've been forced to check them, they get lost and show up three or four days later.
[00:34:46.537 --> 00:34:50.460]  After I've already left some city and then they've got to get mail back to Austin.
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:55.663]  And then, I mean, it just goes on and on and on with these people.
[00:34:55.703 --> 00:35:02.607]  And you know, Ron Paul reminded me something that's huge, that I had totally forgotten about.
[00:35:02.627 --> 00:35:09.752]  The House passed a law last year that they couldn't do these body scans.
[00:35:10.532 --> 00:35:12.934]  And they still just do it because the Senate didn't pass it.
[00:35:14.042 --> 00:35:15.803]  The House doesn't want it.
[00:35:16.344 --> 00:35:17.624]  The people don't want it.
[00:35:18.085 --> 00:35:22.728]  I've looked at the way they ask these polls, where 50, 60 percent, depending on the poll, want the body scanners.
[00:35:23.088 --> 00:35:30.113]  Then it says, do you want increased high-tech security scanners for weapons that would ease how fast you go through the airport?
[00:35:30.493 --> 00:35:31.133]  Oh, yes.
[00:35:31.954 --> 00:35:36.757]  But if they say, do you want the government to record your naked body and that of your children and store it in a database?
[00:35:37.497 --> 00:35:37.718]  No.
[00:35:37.738 --> 00:35:39.419]  75, 80, 90 percent, depending on the poll.
[00:35:42.162 --> 00:35:50.266]  They have polls where they ask it in the Guardian scientific poll, where they ask it where most people would be for it, and 76% were against it.
[00:35:50.586 --> 00:35:54.908]  I've asked Watson to do a blurb on that so people can see it at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:35:55.169 --> 00:35:58.230]  House passes bill limiting the use of whole body scanners, but they don't care.
[00:36:00.091 --> 00:36:04.573]  Later towards the end of the show, I haven't launched the official contest yet.
[00:36:06.014 --> 00:36:07.595]  I haven't launched the exact details.
[00:36:08.792 --> 00:36:21.921]  I know I'm gonna do $5,000 for the best media stunt, legal, lawful stunt to expose the body scanners in your town, in your city.
[00:36:23.643 --> 00:36:32.789]  $10,000 for the best protest video of a protest at a federal building or on the edge of the property, not on the property of an airport.
[00:36:34.931 --> 00:36:36.452]  And my wife,
[00:36:39.116 --> 00:36:39.818]  Had the idea.
[00:36:39.838 --> 00:36:39.978]  My wife.
[00:36:42.901 --> 00:36:44.662]  Hates PETA, she wanted me to add that point.
[00:36:45.002 --> 00:36:57.590]  She worked for him for a little while and she knows they're rather go, this was like 14 years ago, she did some of the rather go naked than fur protests that were on the cover of USA Today, you name it.
[00:36:58.331 --> 00:37:04.054]  And she said that would really be effective to show how they're stripping you, to show the public that this is a naked body scanner.
[00:37:04.715 --> 00:37:11.119]  And, you know, I said preliminarily, I said yesterday, I still wasn't sure about the contest, that that would probably be a great idea.
[00:37:12.316 --> 00:37:15.999]  If people want to do that, that's their issue as long as they check their local laws.
[00:37:16.419 --> 00:37:17.560]  Most places, it's okay.
[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:19.962]  But that's... you don't have to do that to be the winner.
[00:37:20.442 --> 00:37:24.845]  I'm going to judge it whatever the best protest is.
[00:37:25.566 --> 00:37:29.549]  And again, I've got to develop this over the weekend, write up the rules, and launch it on Monday.
[00:37:29.889 --> 00:37:36.034]  So the best stunt, the best protest, and that can be however you organize it, however you do it,
[00:37:38.445 --> 00:37:43.214]  And again, it will be the video, because we can't really judge a protest itself.
[00:37:43.334 --> 00:37:49.244]  It's whoever goes to a protest, organizes a protest, and then makes the best video.
[00:37:50.322 --> 00:37:53.384]  Whoever makes the best video of the protest.
[00:37:53.404 --> 00:37:56.025]  You're not winning the prize for the protest itself.
[00:37:56.305 --> 00:37:58.747]  That's your First Amendment right, and if you choose to go out and do it, you do.
[00:37:59.207 --> 00:38:09.433]  All of us win by the hundreds of videos that will get made, that will get posted, that then tens of millions of people, conservatively, in a year, sometimes in a week, depending on how big these are, will see.
[00:38:09.453 --> 00:38:14.376]  $5,000 for the best stunt that you videotape that's legal and lawful.
[00:38:15.076 --> 00:38:15.957]  Check your local laws.
[00:38:19.638 --> 00:38:33.562]  $10,000 for the best video, the best protest that you are part of, and $5,000 for the best poster against body scanning and Big Brother that you then post legally and lawfully in public places.
[00:38:35.343 --> 00:38:39.104]  So, I've got to write those up this weekend.
[00:38:39.504 --> 00:38:42.245]  Next week I'll announce the dates and how people do it.
[00:38:44.049 --> 00:38:46.230]  I guess people seem to think alike.
[00:38:46.491 --> 00:39:00.979]  It was pointed out to me by Rob Dew, I haven't seen the video yet, that it was in some British newspapers that last weekend, before we even thought of this, simultaneously, or separately, that some folks did the topless protest and it made the news against the body scanners.
[00:39:01.399 --> 00:39:02.440]  We can beat this!
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:06.822]  Congress already passed, the House already passed a law against it, but the Senate didn't.
[00:39:07.343 --> 00:39:10.545]  We need to have it brought back up, passed again in the new Congress.
[00:39:10.845 --> 00:39:12.746]  I asked Ron Paul again to reintroduce it.
[00:39:13.905 --> 00:39:17.649]  Hopefully he'll do that, and we can get the Senate to go along with this.
[00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:21.394]  I mean, this is a big deal, folks, an act of submission to government.
[00:39:21.674 --> 00:39:22.815]  So we're going to your phone calls.
[00:39:23.848 --> 00:39:36.181]  Throughout this hour, into the next hour, and into the hour following that, we've got two hours and 40 minutes, 30 seconds left in this worldwide broadcast.
[00:39:36.581 --> 00:39:43.168]  But again, anybody that enters these contests, anybody that takes action, you win because you're strengthening the liberty muscles.
[00:39:43.208 --> 00:39:44.270]  You're getting involved.
[00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:45.110]  It's like jogging.
[00:39:45.939 --> 00:39:47.259]  At first, you can't jog a mile.
[00:39:47.299 --> 00:39:48.720]  Pretty soon, you can jog five miles.
[00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:50.801]  Pretty soon, you can run a marathon.
[00:39:51.341 --> 00:39:55.162]  It's the act of going out and resisting and saying, I don't agree with this.
[00:39:55.522 --> 00:39:56.522]  This is Big Brother.
[00:39:56.922 --> 00:39:58.523]  This is wrong.
[00:40:00.924 --> 00:40:07.086]  Also, in the last 30 minutes of the show, I'm going to break down another facet of the eugenicist and Bernard Shaw and others.
[00:40:07.106 --> 00:40:10.467]  We're going to have Aaron Dykes in studio with us, but I'm about to go to your calls.
[00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:16.251]  Want to put the call out to listeners to financially support us.
[00:40:16.852 --> 00:40:26.755]  I can't do $20,000 contest, which have all been incredibly successful, even the smaller contest, at reaching millions of people unless we get funds and support.
[00:40:27.435 --> 00:40:28.135]  And that's what I do.
[00:40:28.195 --> 00:40:35.498]  I'm expanding our studios, expanding our office, hiring more people, upgrading the websites, adding more for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:46.174]  Just continually trying to expand what we do and I don't think there's any place in the fight against the New World Order, any facet of what
[00:40:47.330 --> 00:41:08.665]  Anybody does out there against the globalists that pound for pound, dollar for dollar, political action for political action is more effective than what we do with this multimedia radio slash TV shows, my films, the news websites, and how we teach people and show people how to be effective and politically active and shatter the left-right paradigm.
[00:41:10.137 --> 00:41:11.237]  So, how do you support us?
[00:41:11.357 --> 00:41:15.579]  And how do you get great, powerful films that'll wake up your friends, families, and your neighbors?
[00:41:15.619 --> 00:41:17.279]  There's nothing more valuable than waking people up.
[00:41:17.739 --> 00:41:19.260]  You get Fall of the Republic.
[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:21.500]  You get Camp FEMA.
[00:41:21.981 --> 00:41:23.541]  You get Endgame, Terror Storm.
[00:41:23.981 --> 00:41:35.785]  All the best books, all the best videos, all the best documentaries that are out there, that I've made or I've produced or that I've seen and I admire, we purchase them in bulk and sell them to you at a discounted price.
[00:41:36.485 --> 00:41:40.590]  And again, we are running out of some of the sizes of the Obama Joker shirts.
[00:41:40.991 --> 00:41:42.432]  When they're gone, they're gone.
[00:41:42.693 --> 00:41:51.984]  But we've added other t-shirts you can get for free if your size is sold out or if you choose another shirt at InfoWars.com when you get Fall of the Republic.
[00:41:52.364 --> 00:41:53.105]  Or in-game.
[00:41:53.345 --> 00:41:57.588]  You can get free copies of Aaron Russo, the 90-minute film I made that has a bunch of extras as well.
[00:41:58.629 --> 00:42:07.616]  Breaking down the cashless society control grid, what Nick Rockefeller told him, how the elites will have their chip, where they go through security, everything, they're left alone, where the public's harassed.
[00:42:07.956 --> 00:42:09.097]  Such an important documentary.
[00:42:09.117 --> 00:42:15.842]  You can get it free in a bunch of the specials we've got at InfoWars.com, or ask about some of the free deals when you call 888-253-3139.
[00:42:20.316 --> 00:42:20.356]  888-253-3139
[00:42:37.762 --> 00:42:40.266]  Five and a half months free at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:42:40.366 --> 00:42:42.890]  Watch the live video simulcast of the radio show.
[00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:45.914]  Download the archives in higher quality in audio and video.
[00:42:46.255 --> 00:42:47.517]  All my films in high quality.
[00:42:47.577 --> 00:42:48.438]  Burn them to DivX.
[00:42:48.478 --> 00:42:49.259]  Give them to people.
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:50.762]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:42:52.722 --> 00:42:54.844]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[00:42:54.884 --> 00:43:11.675]  Now, again, we have wide open phones, but I'm asking listeners to give me your take on the secret conference committee in the House and Senate not letting the public see it, Obama promising to do it, under pressure saying, okay, of all these days and days of meetings, you'll get to see one hour of staged, prepared statements.
[00:43:13.036 --> 00:43:15.638]  And none of the secret activity going on in the criminal government.
[00:43:17.819 --> 00:43:19.461]  What do you think about the body scanners?
[00:43:19.601 --> 00:43:21.182]  About homeschoolers being arrested?
[00:43:23.721 --> 00:43:25.503]  And I want to stand up for this family.
[00:43:25.543 --> 00:43:28.526]  They're talking about taking, and we're going to your calls.
[00:43:28.546 --> 00:43:29.728]  I want to get these numbers out first.
[00:43:30.148 --> 00:43:35.194]  They are taking, they're talking about taking this family's children.
[00:43:36.635 --> 00:43:40.039]  They are talking about in New York State,
[00:43:42.279 --> 00:43:51.887]  And the Fonda Fultonville school superintendent, they sent police to their house because they didn't register their children with homeschooling, which was a civil matter.
[00:43:52.128 --> 00:43:55.190]  I've read the law, printed it off yesterday.
[00:43:55.911 --> 00:43:58.913]  But the CPS, this shows their tyranny,
[00:43:59.909 --> 00:44:11.218]  There's no log that's yelling at your kids, no log that's spanking them, but they can then decide if yelling or if not putting them in public school or not registering them, if that's endangerment.
[00:44:11.578 --> 00:44:17.262]  So the CPS agent and the judge becomes judge, jury and executioner and God.
[00:44:18.023 --> 00:44:26.450]  Inside the eugenics cults set up about 110 years ago right around there in different states in the United States, 120 years ago in England for racial hygiene.
[00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:36.458]  Everything that George Bernard Shaw talked about, the big head liberal here in the U.S., how they would set up these family courts and then take everybody's kids and the state would end the family.
[00:44:36.858 --> 00:44:40.161]  And anyone who didn't produce or when you got old, they would just kill you.
[00:44:40.461 --> 00:44:41.763]  He actually says all this.
[00:44:41.803 --> 00:44:45.846]  The video of him saying it is coming up in the last hour today.
[00:44:47.808 --> 00:44:49.749]  The diabolicalness of these people.
[00:44:50.810 --> 00:44:53.713]  And so they're persecuting them, they're trying to take their children,
[00:44:56.242 --> 00:45:04.245]  Right now, this family is in between a rock and a hard place.
[00:45:04.785 --> 00:45:06.305]  It is the Cressy family.
[00:45:07.206 --> 00:45:10.627]  We've seen emails from the police and superintendent and others to locals.
[00:45:11.367 --> 00:45:12.847]  Burmas actually went to school in this town.
[00:45:12.867 --> 00:45:15.248]  This is where Jason Burmas has lived and went to college.
[00:45:16.549 --> 00:45:19.630]  And it's just amazing.
[00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:23.431]  And the superintendent's like, well, we had one case where a
[00:45:24.648 --> 00:45:27.189]  Eighteen-year-old couldn't read after homeschooling.
[00:45:27.769 --> 00:45:32.111]  That's always the PR that homeschoolers don't get taught when statistically they're the best that's out there.
[00:45:33.192 --> 00:45:37.534]  And I have the article out of France where yelling at your husband or wife you get arrested for.
[00:45:38.533 --> 00:45:40.014]  Not cussing, no, no, just yelling.
[00:45:40.794 --> 00:45:43.195]  That encourages wives and husbands to tattle on each other.
[00:45:43.716 --> 00:45:54.321]  They said, well, we've had 150-something deaths in 2008, the statistics are always a year old, of husband and wives killing each other, so if somebody out of 60 million, 61 million, 500,000 people, 61 million, 500,000 people in France
[00:45:58.223 --> 00:46:05.788]  If 150-something people, I read the statistics yesterday, kill each other, then everyone loses their rights and everyone's a slave.
[00:46:06.108 --> 00:46:10.731]  If there's one underwear firecracker bomber, everybody's got to be naked body scanned.
[00:46:11.672 --> 00:46:15.234]  If one person sows explosives in their body, everyone's got to be x-rayed.
[00:46:15.294 --> 00:46:16.375]  They're now calling for that.
[00:46:17.416 --> 00:46:18.416]  They always push it further.
[00:46:18.476 --> 00:46:19.517]  Oh, you don't want to be body scanned?
[00:46:19.717 --> 00:46:20.618]  How about x-rayed?
[00:46:20.838 --> 00:46:23.039]  Okay, we won't x-ray you, we'll just body scan you.
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.181]  But then two years later, now we're going to x-ray you.
[00:46:27.546 --> 00:46:30.608]  At some airports, they actually do a proctology exam.
[00:46:30.628 --> 00:46:32.549]  They actually put a glove on and go into you.
[00:46:32.629 --> 00:46:40.574]  I mean, they take your laptops all over the news for five years when you fly around and they just take them and download their contents and send them to you months later.
[00:46:41.114 --> 00:46:44.536]  They order people to give them their email passcodes and sit there and read it in front of them.
[00:46:44.936 --> 00:46:47.578]  I have news reports here where reporters
[00:46:48.178 --> 00:46:54.981]  Are seeing men stand around, pull out hot blondes, put them in the naked body scanner and sit around laughing and smiling.
[00:46:55.221 --> 00:47:01.324]  I see it on the news, images of a woman being scanned and the guys are looking at the screen going, I mean this is sick!
[00:47:02.185 --> 00:47:03.845]  Who do you think takes these jobs?
[00:47:05.426 --> 00:47:06.867]  Let me give you the numbers and I'm going to your calls.
[00:47:09.932 --> 00:47:11.874]  Montgomery County, New York Sheriff.
[00:47:12.195 --> 00:47:18.142]  Now when you call them, be polite but focused and say, we know through color of law you declared endangerment.
[00:47:18.623 --> 00:47:23.209]  And that you went color of law, this is racketeering, because it was a civil matter.
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:25.481]  Uh, with them.
[00:47:26.181 --> 00:47:29.784]  They should have been sent the equivalent of a truancy letter, but you didn't do that.
[00:47:29.884 --> 00:47:32.966]  You arrested them for a stunt under child endangerment.
[00:47:33.186 --> 00:47:34.327]  This is outrageous.
[00:47:34.367 --> 00:47:39.790]  And the American people know what you did, and every commenter on the CBS News site disagrees with what you did.
[00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:40.411]  Know that.
[00:47:40.771 --> 00:47:46.635]  And the people of that town need to vote these government people out and put patriots in.
[00:47:46.895 --> 00:47:48.036]  Take your town back!
[00:47:49.502 --> 00:47:53.085]  Montgomery County, New York Sheriff, Michael J. Amato.
[00:47:53.305 --> 00:47:54.326]  Phone 518-853-5500.
[00:47:54.386 --> 00:48:04.493]  And if you see this in a week on PrisonPlanet.tv or YouTube or somewhere, still call.
[00:48:04.833 --> 00:48:10.897]  Just the action of you making the call, getting past the intimidation, talking to them, letting them know you don't appreciate them.
[00:48:10.918 --> 00:48:11.438]  518-853-5500.
[00:48:11.518 --> 00:48:12.759]  Don't steal their children.
[00:48:17.142 --> 00:48:22.667]  Because normally what they do when they persecute somebody, they keep persecuting to make themselves feel like what they're doing is right.
[00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:27.932]  Call the Montgomery County, New York County Sheriff's Department 518-853-5500.
[00:48:27.952 --> 00:48:28.092]  518-853-5500.
[00:48:28.132 --> 00:48:28.573]  Everyone call.
[00:48:28.593 --> 00:48:30.835]  This family is cornered by these wolves right now.
[00:48:30.855 --> 00:48:30.895]  518-853-5500.
[00:48:31.015 --> 00:48:33.257]  And we need this sheriff to be voted out immediately.
[00:48:44.625 --> 00:48:48.849]  I mean, the thing's unconstitutional, it's not freedom, it's like saying it's the law, blacks are slaves.
[00:48:48.869 --> 00:48:50.110]  I don't want to hear it's the law, garbage.
[00:48:50.350 --> 00:48:51.711]  I know they manipulated the law on this.
[00:48:53.453 --> 00:48:59.878]  But, the fact that they arrested them and took their kids and now they may not get them back, this is outrageous.
[00:48:59.898 --> 00:48:59.938]  518-853-5500.
[00:49:00.018 --> 00:49:00.359]  James Conboy.
[00:49:06.417 --> 00:49:08.758]  District Attorney 518-853-4516.
[00:49:08.798 --> 00:49:11.220]  That's the clerk.
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:14.181]  518-853-4516.
[00:49:14.881 --> 00:49:19.024]  Call that district attorney and tell him shame on you and we know what you did manipulatively.
[00:49:19.804 --> 00:49:36.457]  Just like when I had the state attorney on from Maryland when they told the kids it was the law to take shots, 2,000 of them on the news with SWAT teams and dogs barking and getting the shots and I had him on and I said, it wasn't a law they had to take shots, it was school policy so they kicked them out of school and truancy was triggered.
[00:49:36.758 --> 00:49:38.339]  And he said, oh, you want to be a lawyer?
[00:49:38.399 --> 00:49:39.800]  Yeah, my kids don't take shots.
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:41.722]  Started laughing on air.
[00:49:42.122 --> 00:49:44.224]  It's funny that they manipulate people.
[00:49:44.244 --> 00:49:44.284]  518-853-4516.
[00:49:51.569 --> 00:49:52.070]  518-853-4516.
[00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:54.491]  District Attorney James Conboy.
[00:49:54.511 --> 00:49:56.373]  And he is a conboy.
[00:49:57.714 --> 00:49:59.855]  Fulton County Child Protective Services.
[00:49:59.895 --> 00:50:01.116]  Let these slimers know.
[00:50:01.796 --> 00:50:02.857]  Support the family.
[00:50:02.897 --> 00:50:04.678]  Get Homeschool Legal Defense Fund involved.
[00:50:04.698 --> 00:50:05.719]  They need to be sued.
[00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:08.761]  They don't have immunity when they're outside of the law.
[00:50:08.781 --> 00:50:08.821]  518-736-5187.
[00:50:11.792 --> 00:50:12.532]  5-6-1-5.
[00:50:12.933 --> 00:50:17.595]  We did this to the county south of Austin and shut their phones down.
[00:50:17.615 --> 00:50:17.835]  5-1-8-7-3-6-5-6-1-5.
[00:50:18.255 --> 00:50:23.018]  Their phones will be so busy they won't be able to kidnap kids today.
[00:50:23.038 --> 00:50:23.438]  5-1-8-7-3-6-5-6-1-5.
[00:50:23.558 --> 00:50:24.099]  Glentown Court.
[00:50:24.299 --> 00:50:25.719]  Call the court itself!
[00:50:25.739 --> 00:50:25.980]  5-1-8-8-5-3-4-8-2-5.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:26.240]  5-1-8-8-5-3-4-8-2-5.
[00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:28.181]  Those are the coordinates.
[00:50:28.201 --> 00:50:28.241]  5-1-8...
[00:50:40.028 --> 00:50:50.056]  8-5-3-4-8-2-5, Glen County Court, Fulton County Child Protective Services, James Conboy, Montgomery County Sheriff's Department, calling ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:50.076 --> 00:50:54.760]  They're trying to make an example of that family so they can take all your kids.
[00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:56.681]  That's openly what the government wants.
[00:50:56.782 --> 00:50:59.324]  I have their own statements in the thousands.
[00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:03.861]  Is your computer running slowly?
[00:51:04.121 --> 00:51:05.541]  Thinking about buying a new one?
[00:51:05.861 --> 00:51:06.922]  Don't waste your money!
[00:51:07.082 --> 00:51:13.224]  Your computer could be infected with spyware, malware, viruses, registry errors, spam, and pop-ups.
[00:51:13.384 --> 00:51:14.804]  You don't need to buy a new computer.
[00:51:15.064 --> 00:51:19.446]  Just go to DoubleMySpeed.com and find out what's slowing your computer down.
[00:51:19.466 --> 00:51:23.307]  DoubleMySpeed totally cleaned up my system and increased my speed.

[00:51:27.328 --> 00:51:28.949]  My computer was on its last leg.
[00:51:29.329 --> 00:51:30.249]  Now it's like new again.

[00:53:01.724 --> 00:53:02.965]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:53:03.025 --> 00:53:08.367]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:53:08.607 --> 00:53:13.229]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:53:13.629 --> 00:53:18.691]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:53:19.191 --> 00:53:23.873]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:53:24.417 --> 00:53:31.339]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[00:53:31.539 --> 00:53:32.419]  And here's the best part.
[00:53:32.659 --> 00:53:35.400]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:39.020]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:53:39.341 --> 00:53:42.181]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:53:42.521 --> 00:53:45.662]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:53:45.682 --> 00:53:45.862]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:53:45.882 --> 00:53:46.102]  Remember,
[00:53:54.471 --> 00:53:58.054]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:53:58.374 --> 00:54:00.815]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:54:04.798 --> 00:54:08.201]  We've gotten a response from the superintendent of schools up there.
[00:54:09.081 --> 00:54:12.203]  We'll tell you about that coming up the next hour, but as promised, your phone calls.
[00:54:12.303 --> 00:54:15.566]  Wilson in Florida, thanks for holding her on the air worldwide.
[00:54:17.127 --> 00:54:18.848]  Hey, good afternoon, Alex.
[00:54:18.908 --> 00:54:19.889]  Happy New Year, too.
[00:54:20.109 --> 00:54:21.490]  I haven't spoken to you since the New Year.
[00:54:22.219 --> 00:54:26.042]  I just want to say that you had a wonderful interview with Ron Paul.
[00:54:26.082 --> 00:54:26.803]  I really liked it.
[00:54:27.263 --> 00:54:28.304]  And I got a quick question.
[00:54:28.484 --> 00:54:32.508]  You said Lord Moncton was like the George Washington in this fight.
[00:54:32.828 --> 00:54:34.329]  What would you consider Ron Paul then?
[00:54:35.330 --> 00:54:41.475]  I said Moncton was the George Washington in the climate change fight specifically.
[00:54:42.651 --> 00:54:48.656]  Specifically in that area, no one has done more leading the people, exposing the fraud.
[00:54:48.676 --> 00:54:50.938]  He's been doing it for 15 years at least.
[00:54:51.959 --> 00:54:54.341]  So I didn't mean overall fighting the New World Order.
[00:54:55.552 --> 00:55:02.457]  And I know that Monckton likes our Founding Fathers, he's Scottish, he's criticized tyranny in England, and so that was the point I was making.
[00:55:02.477 --> 00:55:08.442]  People don't know that in the UK, in England, some of our biggest supporters in the Revolutionary War were in England.
[00:55:08.462 --> 00:55:12.665]  So that was the point, by saying George Washington, of the climate change fight.
[00:55:12.985 --> 00:55:14.066]  This is a global fight.
[00:55:15.067 --> 00:55:22.652]  Ron Paul is a polite, intelligent, focused elder statesman, and I wouldn't call him
[00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:26.631]  I wouldn't call him a George Washington.
[00:55:26.651 --> 00:55:31.994]  I would perhaps a Thomas Jefferson.
[00:55:33.855 --> 00:55:38.017]  Perhaps a John Quincy Adams or something.
[00:55:38.057 --> 00:55:38.358]  I don't know.
[00:55:38.378 --> 00:55:38.838]  What do you think?
[00:55:41.185 --> 00:55:44.687]  I'm not too great on the history, even though I shared it with the founding fathers.
[00:55:45.047 --> 00:55:46.127]  And one last question.
[00:55:47.508 --> 00:55:52.830]  I'm not sure if you've seen Ben Stein on TV called Ron Paul anti-Semitic?
[00:55:53.050 --> 00:55:53.371]  Yes.
[00:55:54.371 --> 00:55:56.472]  Do you think that he's going to debate Ron Paul?
[00:55:57.682 --> 00:55:58.463]  I don't think he will.
[00:55:58.804 --> 00:56:00.105]  He won't come on this show.
[00:56:00.125 --> 00:56:00.986]  We've challenged him to.
[00:56:01.026 --> 00:56:04.351]  And Ben Stein made a great film about the environmentalist being eugenicist.
[00:56:04.951 --> 00:56:06.894]  And so we wanted him on in a friendly way.
[00:56:07.635 --> 00:56:10.879]  But that's all that the neocons have.
[00:56:11.019 --> 00:56:12.581]  That's all the Israel lobby has.
[00:56:13.062 --> 00:56:15.585]  I mean, Ron Paul is against all foreign aid.
[00:56:16.494 --> 00:56:29.563]  He's against it for Egypt, he's against it for China, he's against it for Nigeria, he's against it for Brazil, he's against $25 billion to General Motors to literally spend at least $3 billion of it to ship it to China, Eastern Europe and Brazil.
[00:56:30.003 --> 00:56:38.649]  It's not because he hates Brazilians, he's not anti-Brazilian and so that's why the ADL and others are being totally discredited because
[00:56:39.409 --> 00:56:40.930]  You say, I don't want a bank or bailout.
[00:56:40.991 --> 00:56:41.871]  Oh, you don't like Jews.
[00:56:42.432 --> 00:56:44.454]  Oh, I don't, you know, want a police state.
[00:56:44.494 --> 00:56:45.375]  Oh, you don't like Jews.
[00:56:45.895 --> 00:56:53.942]  And they're actually creating anti-Semitism by always injecting Jews into everything and making Jews take the side of New World Order.
[00:56:54.683 --> 00:56:57.365]  It's really, it doesn't work anymore.
[00:56:58.166 --> 00:56:59.727]  They call everybody anti-semitic.
[00:57:01.528 --> 00:57:03.468]  I mean, you know, the ADL attacks me.
[00:57:03.869 --> 00:57:09.091]  They don't dare call me anti-semitic because I've had my lawyer put them on notice of a tort if they ever do it.
[00:57:09.811 --> 00:57:11.312]  One time when they did and they retracted.
[00:57:11.332 --> 00:57:15.134]  And they've lost lawsuits before, by the way, because of these activities with other people.
[00:57:15.734 --> 00:57:20.557]  So they always try to just call me an extremist and the king of conspiracy and all of this stuff.
[00:57:21.438 --> 00:57:31.585]  But people need to watch themselves because, you know, that is a horrible slur and slander to just throw on someone calling them an anti-Semite.
[00:57:32.586 --> 00:57:38.931]  And again, Jewish groups continue to speak for Jews and inject
[00:57:41.252 --> 00:57:56.196]  Well, I just want to make one final point that going into the year 2009, I was able to talk to you on New Year's Eve, but this year I couldn't.
[00:57:56.216 --> 00:58:03.959]  You know, the lines were a little busy, so that just shows how things are really picking up and how you're really going to have much bigger, like,
[00:58:06.050 --> 00:58:07.832]  Oh, people paying attention this year.
[00:58:08.252 --> 00:58:08.893]  Sure, Wilson.
[00:58:09.233 --> 00:58:10.375]  Wilson, I appreciate your call.
[00:58:10.395 --> 00:58:11.156]  Happy New Year to you.
[00:58:11.196 --> 00:58:11.856]  Have a great New Year.
[00:58:11.896 --> 00:58:12.497]  Fightin' tyranny.
[00:58:12.977 --> 00:58:14.499]  Folks, we have our own phone system.
[00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:18.744]  They only have six phone lines at Genesis in Minnesota that we mainly take calls off of.
[00:58:19.164 --> 00:58:21.206]  We have a system that can take over 100 calls.
[00:58:23.068 --> 00:58:25.891]  And when we open the phone system up for 10 seconds, we'll get 30 or 40.
[00:58:28.553 --> 00:58:30.635]  Okay, so yeah, and we could do that years ago.
[00:58:31.175 --> 00:58:35.980]  I mean, I could take a thousand phone calls in an hour if I could physically get them on the air.
[00:58:37.041 --> 00:58:38.622]  Let's come back and take some more of those calls.
[00:58:38.662 --> 00:58:39.102]  Stay with us.
[00:58:42.806 --> 00:58:44.687]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:48.351]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:52.222 --> 00:58:55.885]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:58:56.245 --> 00:58:59.248]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:58:59.488 --> 00:59:04.272]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:59:04.292 --> 00:59:10.537]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:59:10.677 --> 00:59:12.919]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:59:13.419 --> 00:59:13.719]  Tim Geithner?
[00:59:13.759 --> 00:59:14.180]  Bernanke?
[00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:15.020]  They're arsonists!
[00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:16.201]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:59:16.221 --> 00:59:18.463]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:59:32.355 --> 00:59:34.196]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:59:34.476 --> 00:59:39.298]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:59:39.618 --> 00:59:49.561]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:53.963 --> 00:59:55.864]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.344 --> 00:59:59.125]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.655 --> 01:00:09.819]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:11.300]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.061 --> 01:00:13.002]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.623 --> 01:00:17.266]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.827 --> 01:00:21.991]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.771 --> 01:00:26.455]  It is Thursday, the 7th day of January 2010.
[01:00:26.615 --> 01:00:30.379]  It's hard to get used to saying that.
[01:00:31.476 --> 01:00:32.236]  But I will soon.
[01:00:32.256 --> 01:00:33.837]  By the time I get used to it, it'll be 2011.
[01:00:33.977 --> 01:00:38.319]  We're continuing with open phones, and then a blitz of news coming up.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:40.380]  Seth in Vegas.
[01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:41.601]  Seth, you're on the air.
[01:00:41.641 --> 01:00:42.001]  Welcome.
[01:00:44.022 --> 01:00:44.442]  Hi, Alex.
[01:00:44.462 --> 01:00:44.843]  Can you hear me?
[01:00:45.203 --> 01:00:45.623]  Yes, sir.
[01:00:46.684 --> 01:00:47.584]  Yes, sir.
[01:00:47.604 --> 01:00:59.530]  I work at McCarran out in Las Vegas, and I talk with 300 to over 1,000 people a day traveling from all over the country, and of course out of the country, and I was discussing the body scanners
[01:01:00.049 --> 01:01:04.752]  With the young lady that flew in from Philadelphia and she said that there were body scanning like everybody out there.
[01:01:05.232 --> 01:01:08.835]  I was just wondering if you had talked with anybody coming through Philadelphia?
[01:01:09.659 --> 01:01:13.840]  Yes, they want to break people's will because of the underwear bomber.
[01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:18.762]  Everywhere where they got the scanners, now they're trying to put them in 214 major airports.
[01:01:19.182 --> 01:01:29.745]  They're taking large portions of people, and I've seen the video on the news, and just getting everybody conditioned as fast as they can during the staged event, during the fear to try to break our resolve.
[01:01:30.065 --> 01:01:37.447]  I mean, the House passed a law against it, and they barely beat it in the Senate, so they're desperate to set the precedent right now.
[01:01:38.598 --> 01:01:43.862]  Yeah, and I've noticed the huge media blitz now with security infractions all over now.
[01:01:44.203 --> 01:01:45.764]  That there's this big security problem.
[01:01:45.784 --> 01:01:49.427]  You know what they're doing, they're just building it up so they can put these scanners in.
[01:01:49.947 --> 01:01:57.994]  Sir, they suddenly have Army and Marines with National Guard, MPs from the Air Force, Army, everywhere!
[01:01:58.074 --> 01:02:01.337]  I see articles every week just randomly in Tennessee, Texas.
[01:02:02.575 --> 01:02:05.256]  Everywhere just randomly searching people on highways.
[01:02:05.697 --> 01:02:07.777]  We're just being slowly quietly.
[01:02:07.818 --> 01:02:09.178]  It's always just in local papers.
[01:02:09.878 --> 01:02:10.739]  Oh, here's the army.
[01:02:10.919 --> 01:02:14.000]  They're getting us ready to fully implode the economy by design.
[01:02:15.041 --> 01:02:17.202]  It's a criminal government that's robbed us.
[01:02:17.602 --> 01:02:23.665]  They need a police state in place so they can get away with it and the cops and the military and everybody that are carrying this out
[01:02:25.319 --> 01:02:28.442]  They never allow a national debate because the people would say no.
[01:02:28.802 --> 01:02:35.528]  They're just quietly conditioning the local governments and the police right now, Seth, so they can have the full rollout of this.
[01:02:35.588 --> 01:02:36.489]  I appreciate your call.
[01:02:36.549 --> 01:02:37.249]  Jim in Missouri.
[01:02:37.529 --> 01:02:38.250]  Or is that Montana?
[01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:39.391]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[01:02:41.593 --> 01:02:42.994]  Hey Alex, Jim, St.
[01:02:43.014 --> 01:02:43.314]  Louis.
[01:02:43.454 --> 01:02:44.676]  Just want to give you a couple updates.
[01:02:45.376 --> 01:02:48.759]  Apparently there was a disgruntled worker here in St.
[01:02:48.799 --> 01:02:50.661]  Louis, CNN, putting it out.
[01:02:51.448 --> 01:02:53.209]  Three apparently are dead.
[01:02:53.469 --> 01:02:54.730]  Eight are wounded.
[01:02:55.791 --> 01:02:56.311]  Go figure.
[01:02:56.471 --> 01:02:58.272]  I just got done shoveling my driveway.
[01:02:58.772 --> 01:02:59.333]  Go figure.
[01:03:00.493 --> 01:03:01.334]  Global warming.
[01:03:01.474 --> 01:03:02.475]  Are we allowed to say that?
[01:03:02.495 --> 01:03:04.396]  I don't know yet.
[01:03:04.836 --> 01:03:05.897]  Well, I'll tell you this.
[01:03:06.097 --> 01:03:07.077]  I'll tell you this, Jim.
[01:03:07.157 --> 01:03:11.100]  I mean, record cold temperatures in the last century all over the planet.
[01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:12.360]  People dying in India.
[01:03:12.701 --> 01:03:14.482]  The biggest snowfall in over 100 years in D.C.
[01:03:17.154 --> 01:03:20.757]  And the last nine years, the Earth's been cooling according to all the temperature data.
[01:03:21.078 --> 01:03:22.659]  But they say you're not allowed to question.
[01:03:22.999 --> 01:03:24.881]  Man-made global warming's gonna kill us all.
[01:03:25.842 --> 01:03:39.694]  Get this, Tel Aviv now, just like you said, they are now implementing instead of just body scanners, they're doing passport, smart cards, thumbprint, and a face scan.
[01:03:41.755 --> 01:03:54.864]  And then we're told, oh, we need to bring Israeli style here, where five different times you get interrogated, and they're going to do that with the Israelis advising, but on top of it, all the other body scanning, and then Israel's adopting all of our stuff.
[01:03:55.865 --> 01:03:57.546]  Hey, I just want to let you know I support you.
[01:03:58.267 --> 01:03:59.328]  I got your membership.
[01:03:59.628 --> 01:04:00.688]  I bought a couple shirts.
[01:04:01.069 --> 01:04:01.429]  Thank you.
[01:04:01.829 --> 01:04:06.733]  Just let you know that you're on it, and the truth will always prevail, bud.
[01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:08.498]  Jim, God bless you.
[01:04:08.558 --> 01:04:09.659]  We are on the march.
[01:04:09.699 --> 01:04:11.140]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:04:11.561 --> 01:04:14.283]  And it is thanks to people like you, Jim, that we're able to operate.
[01:04:14.584 --> 01:04:18.767]  The PrisonPlanet.tv membership is 15 cents a day, $5.95 a month, or get it even cheaper.
[01:04:19.088 --> 01:04:21.050]  When you get a year, you get five and a half months free.
[01:04:22.371 --> 01:04:23.932]  That special ends next Friday.
[01:04:24.853 --> 01:04:28.214]  People buying the books, the videos, supporting our sponsors.
[01:04:29.034 --> 01:04:30.975]  All of that makes this radio show possible.
[01:04:31.035 --> 01:04:32.676]  We couldn't do what we're doing without you.
[01:04:32.696 --> 01:04:35.737]  We're gonna go to break, and I'm gonna try to go to calls even faster.
[01:04:35.837 --> 01:04:38.118]  Michael, Joe, Ronnie, and others.
[01:04:38.138 --> 01:04:38.198]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:04:43.035 --> 01:04:47.976]  The government is a cult, a criminal enterprise, taking over our society.
[01:04:48.337 --> 01:04:50.297]  The people are standing up and saying no.
[01:04:50.777 --> 01:04:56.959]  Every act of resistance you carry out brings the New World Order one inch closer to destruction.
[01:04:56.979 --> 01:04:59.020]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:00.180]  Ton of news coming up as well.
[01:05:01.598 --> 01:05:04.201]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:05:04.621 --> 01:05:09.586]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:05:09.946 --> 01:05:11.688]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:05:11.988 --> 01:05:16.813]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:05:16.993 --> 01:05:17.914]  How much do you want?
[01:05:18.154 --> 01:05:18.915]  When do you want it?
[01:05:19.295 --> 01:05:20.896]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:05:21.177 --> 01:05:21.997]  When will you need it?
[01:05:22.257 --> 01:05:24.319]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:05:24.459 --> 01:05:25.560]  Will there be any food?
[01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:27.121]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:05:27.322 --> 01:05:32.386]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:05:32.586 --> 01:05:35.769]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:05:36.169 --> 01:05:39.632]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:05:39.992 --> 01:05:40.973]  How much will you need?
[01:05:41.213 --> 01:05:41.813]  We don't know.
[01:05:42.114 --> 01:05:43.014]  How much do you want?
[01:05:43.214 --> 01:05:43.955]  All you can get.
[01:05:44.135 --> 01:05:44.996]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:05:45.236 --> 01:05:48.018]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:06:00.888 --> 01:06:01.869]  What's your home worth?
[01:06:02.050 --> 01:06:03.972]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[01:06:04.152 --> 01:06:06.896]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[01:06:07.196 --> 01:06:14.725]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:07.115]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:07:07.215 --> 01:07:08.476]  No, this isn't science fiction.

[01:08:01.421 --> 01:08:06.503]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.824 --> 01:08:09.085]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:20.945 --> 01:08:31.771]  In the last three years, we've seen mainstream national television tell the public that lithium in the water to brain damage you is good.
[01:08:31.791 --> 01:08:36.253]  And that if it makes one person not commit suicide, we need to do it.
[01:08:37.574 --> 01:08:45.078]  We've seen federally financed studies come out and say that mercury is good for your children's brains.
[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:54.525]  When, of course, literally tens of thousands of studies in the last hundred years show it's one of the most deadly heavy metals and just literally burns through the brain.
[01:08:54.946 --> 01:08:57.287]  It doesn't just kill a few brain cells and then deposit out.
[01:08:58.088 --> 01:08:58.908]  It keeps burning.
[01:08:59.849 --> 01:09:08.534]  In the electron microscope videos that we've posted for major universities, it's the only heavy metal that causes electrochemical explosions in the brains.
[01:09:09.275 --> 01:09:15.479]  Kind of similar to the movie Alien, when the acid, the blood of the alien burns through four or five levels of the ship,
[01:09:17.878 --> 01:09:20.762]  That's what Mercury does, but they say it's nutritious and good.
[01:09:22.204 --> 01:09:23.706]  They say it's wonderful for you.
[01:09:24.908 --> 01:09:27.191]  They have TV newscasts where they now say...
[01:09:28.171 --> 01:09:31.833]  Things like, oh, we want poison in the toys from China.
[01:09:32.173 --> 01:09:33.534]  It's good for our economy.
[01:09:34.434 --> 01:09:36.635]  China just had another big melamine scare.
[01:09:37.096 --> 01:09:38.176]  More people getting sick.
[01:09:39.317 --> 01:09:43.179]  Melamine was found in 90% of baby formula in the U.S.
[01:09:44.319 --> 01:09:44.899]  from U.S.
[01:09:44.959 --> 01:09:45.480]  factories.
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:51.383]  And instead of them taking the melamine out, they just said, melamine is no longer bad for you.
[01:09:52.043 --> 01:09:53.424]  Mercury's no longer bad.
[01:09:53.964 --> 01:09:55.445]  Melamine's no longer bad.
[01:09:55.465 --> 01:09:57.386]  Lead is no longer bad.
[01:09:58.046 --> 01:10:01.508]  Jumping off a cliff, I guess, is no longer bad, according to the government.
[01:10:02.395 --> 01:10:08.076]  And now I have Fox News, this is coming up after calls, in my stack.
[01:10:08.096 --> 01:10:10.857]  Let me get a close shot for prisonplanet.tv viewers.
[01:10:11.777 --> 01:10:13.817]  Can cell phones cure Alzheimer's?
[01:10:14.357 --> 01:10:17.898]  And it says cell phones are good for your brain.
[01:10:18.538 --> 01:10:21.279]  Yes, it's radiating your brain, but it's good for you.
[01:10:21.999 --> 01:10:26.400]  Cell phones are good, body scanners are good, mercury is good for your brain.
[01:10:28.646 --> 01:10:32.488]  Pretty soon they'll say shooting yourself in the head with a 12-gauge shotgun is good for you.
[01:10:32.829 --> 01:10:34.510]  Folks, if they start saying that, don't try it.
[01:10:34.570 --> 01:10:35.150]  It will kill you.
[01:10:35.991 --> 01:10:38.312]  They are practicing insanity.
[01:10:38.672 --> 01:10:42.134]  Practicing lying to get you conditioned to accept it.
[01:10:43.655 --> 01:10:49.319]  That's how they claim they killed Khalid Sheikh Mohammed more than 10 times before they captured him.
[01:10:49.999 --> 01:10:51.600]  Then they held him for 7 years.
[01:10:51.901 --> 01:10:56.804]  He confessed to bombing buildings that weren't built for close to 4 years after he was arrested.
[01:10:58.325 --> 01:11:01.306]  That's like confessing to singing the Titanic before he was born.
[01:11:02.787 --> 01:11:20.556]  But the media still says, never retracted, he was killed all those times, and he was captured, and he's confessed to bombing buildings that didn't exist, and they did this over and over again with Chemical Ali and all of them, to just set the precedent of doing whatever they want.
[01:11:22.645 --> 01:11:31.712]  Because they know the general public is passively watching TV, passively reading the newspaper headlines, and just hear a guy tried to blow up a plane again.
[01:11:31.732 --> 01:11:33.594]  Oh, this guy confessed.
[01:11:33.614 --> 01:11:42.561]  Oh, they're going to put him on trial, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, after seven years of incarceration and admitted torture.
[01:11:43.542 --> 01:11:49.647]  Folks, if they grab me for a year and then roll me out on TV saying I committed murders or bombings,
[01:11:50.615 --> 01:11:53.317]  And they admit I was tortured or you were tortured.
[01:11:53.457 --> 01:11:54.597]  It's not admissible.
[01:11:55.338 --> 01:12:01.521]  All Americans knew in the war with North Korea, hundreds and hundreds of pilots got shot down.
[01:12:03.743 --> 01:12:12.768]  And after a couple years of captivity, the North Koreans would release on worldwide television to the Soviets, to the Chinese and Russians,
[01:12:14.056 --> 01:12:17.279]  Film footage of our airmen saying, I am a war criminal.
[01:12:17.419 --> 01:12:19.281]  I was told to target women and children.
[01:12:19.661 --> 01:12:23.525]  I was told to target civilian bases, which wasn't true in the Korean War.
[01:12:25.277 --> 01:12:29.978]  And they would, you know, the famous cases of blinking Morse code, that's not just a Hollywood movie.
[01:12:30.639 --> 01:12:36.600]  They blinked Morse code saying torture, torture, torture, torture, torture, torture, torture.
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:38.041]  Same thing in Vietnam.
[01:12:38.301 --> 01:12:40.421]  They'd roll our troops out after years of torture.
[01:12:41.001 --> 01:12:42.442]  They would confess to anything.
[01:12:43.382 --> 01:12:48.423]  Americans knew, a country that tortures, you don't believe anyone they bring up on trial.
[01:12:51.144 --> 01:12:52.124]  What happened to us?
[01:12:52.885 --> 01:12:54.185]  How did we turn into demons?
[01:12:55.828 --> 01:12:57.028]  Well, we didn't turn into demons.
[01:12:57.368 --> 01:13:02.450]  The government said we like torture, said we like torture of children in front of their parents to try to sell us on it.
[01:13:03.230 --> 01:13:07.331]  So that's coming up with a bunch of other news, but who's up next here?
[01:13:07.391 --> 01:13:09.171]  Ronnie in Texas, or did it already go to him?
[01:13:11.572 --> 01:13:12.152]  That's what I thought.
[01:13:12.212 --> 01:13:13.372]  Okay, Mike in Chicago.
[01:13:13.452 --> 01:13:14.152]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:13:15.653 --> 01:13:15.893]  Me?
[01:13:16.493 --> 01:13:16.913]  Yes, sir.
[01:13:17.533 --> 01:13:24.935]  Hey, you know, I'm listening to you on the body scanner stuff, and one of the things that scares me every time I see the
[01:13:25.959 --> 01:13:30.503]  Report on the news is that they keep mentioning that he paid for his ticket with cash.
[01:13:31.543 --> 01:13:35.586]  Yeah, cash is evil, and they had body scanners there, but he wasn't put through them.
[01:13:35.626 --> 01:13:36.667]  He was let onto the plane.
[01:13:37.368 --> 01:13:43.993]  Right, and so, you know, I mean, I think the body scanners, I don't know, you know, sometimes I wonder, what's a distraction?
[01:13:44.053 --> 01:13:51.899]  Not that they're a distraction, not that they're inconsequential, but are they a distraction from the real ultimate goal, which is to basically eliminate cash?
[01:13:53.442 --> 01:14:01.930]  Well, sir, they've got ads in newspapers I've seen for more than a decade and TV ads and magazine ads saying cash is dirty, cash is bad.
[01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:03.672]  During the swine flu, the feds did that.
[01:14:03.992 --> 01:14:09.097]  They want everything digital to destroy underground economies and further bankrupt people.
[01:14:09.618 --> 01:14:16.564]  And I agree with you, but body scanners aren't a distraction from the health care bill because they've already pretty much got that as a done deal.
[01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:22.022]  I don't disagree.
[01:14:22.042 --> 01:14:22.903]  I don't disagree.
[01:14:23.223 --> 01:14:23.984]  And that's what I mean.
[01:14:24.204 --> 01:14:27.307]  I think that's one of the steps in taking away your cash later.
[01:14:27.327 --> 01:14:29.929]  I mean, would you like the body scanner to go away?
[01:14:30.209 --> 01:14:31.390]  Well, we've solved the problem.
[01:14:31.790 --> 01:14:32.851]  Nobody's using cash.
[01:14:34.573 --> 01:14:37.075]  I don't necessarily mean that this isn't consequential.
[01:14:39.677 --> 01:14:46.341]  Is it just one step in the ultimate goal of... I mean, the cashless society scares me more than anything in terms of control.
[01:14:46.361 --> 01:14:49.282]  I mean, second only maybe to healthcare.
[01:14:49.802 --> 01:14:59.087]  And notice how all the businesses are being pressured and all the government employees and corporate employees to take automatic transfer, to do automatic payments, to only use a card.
[01:14:59.107 --> 01:15:00.088]  I agree with you, Michael.
[01:15:00.388 --> 01:15:01.148]  Thanks for the call.
[01:15:01.748 --> 01:15:04.350]  I got confused by Michael in Illinois and Michael in Chicago.
[01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:05.811]  Michael in Chicago is coming up.
[01:15:06.211 --> 01:15:07.892]  Joe in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:15:07.932 --> 01:15:08.272]  Go ahead.
[01:15:09.529 --> 01:15:15.031]  Alex, first off, in the words of Native American Indians, thank you for being a true human being.
[01:15:16.251 --> 01:15:21.553]  And my second was like, I thought I was seeing things yesterday morning between 8 and 9.
[01:15:21.753 --> 01:15:24.634]  I had the volume down and watching Fox.
[01:15:25.074 --> 01:15:32.497]  And they showed that, from what I saw on the body scan, they showed, it looked to me like
[01:15:33.792 --> 01:15:42.679]  It's not just the booth you go into, but they got, it looked to me like a scanner that you can see the whole body, basically.
[01:15:43.019 --> 01:15:47.182]  Sir, yes, yes, they phase it in.
[01:15:48.083 --> 01:15:52.807]  Five airports, last time I read it in CBS, have passive body scanners.
[01:15:53.803 --> 01:15:59.347]  First, under your ticket, they put you through a body scanner that records a 360 biometric scan.
[01:15:59.967 --> 01:16:08.553]  Then, they've got passive scanners in the airports that once you've been scanned, from then on out, it's in a database, that know your entire body.
[01:16:09.174 --> 01:16:14.157]  So they look through your clothes with what they call a passive scanner and scan you.
[01:16:14.738 --> 01:16:17.319]  They also, five airports and the same reports I saw,
[01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:25.646]  Years ago, they have brain scanners that quote, pick up anger, brain waves that show agitation.
[01:16:25.826 --> 01:16:29.970]  All quackery, all fraud, not real science.
[01:16:30.931 --> 01:16:35.555]  Hundreds of thousands of people conservatively, the government's now admitted this, that's why they don't use lie detectors anymore in court.
[01:16:36.345 --> 01:16:37.205]  Or in court proceedings.
[01:16:37.845 --> 01:16:43.887]  They would just lie and say a lie detector showed you were guilty even when you said you weren't and later it would come out you were innocent.
[01:16:44.527 --> 01:16:45.428]  That's quackery.
[01:16:45.808 --> 01:16:47.908]  So they've just moved on to new baloney.
[01:16:48.389 --> 01:16:48.749]  Yes.
[01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:54.090]  We've written articles at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com on body scanners.
[01:16:54.510 --> 01:16:59.172]  Steve Watson had one up yesterday that had the images from the news of the passive scanners.
[01:17:00.232 --> 01:17:08.776]  Once they scan you in the airport, it's assigned to your name, and major cities have already put body scanners in.
[01:17:08.796 --> 01:17:09.417]  Do you understand?
[01:17:09.917 --> 01:17:11.218]  Sir, this is a total grid.
[01:17:12.098 --> 01:17:12.538]  Yes, sir.
[01:17:13.239 --> 01:17:25.665]  And the other thing regarding the homeschooling, I know, Alex, you have it documented that homeschoolers, in other words, like if they're doing third grade, I have two nieces that are homeschooled.
[01:17:26.361 --> 01:17:33.548]  And if they're third grade, they're doing fifth grade education level school work.
[01:17:35.710 --> 01:17:39.975]  And also, excellent consulting you do with Jesse.
[01:17:40.135 --> 01:17:42.617]  I saw the mind control and it's very, very scary.
[01:17:42.957 --> 01:17:45.860]  And I see things advancing just so fast, Alex.
[01:17:46.241 --> 01:17:48.523]  But thank you for Prison Planet and InfoWars, brother.
[01:17:49.244 --> 01:17:49.644]  Thank you.
[01:17:49.724 --> 01:17:50.724]  I appreciate your call.
[01:17:50.784 --> 01:17:53.165]  Let's jam in one more here quickly.
[01:17:54.145 --> 01:17:56.105]  Let's talk to Ronnie in Texas.
[01:17:56.205 --> 01:17:57.105]  Ronnie, you're on the air.
[01:17:57.646 --> 01:17:58.246]  Thank you, sir.
[01:17:58.366 --> 01:17:59.126]  Celebrate the year 2010.
[01:17:59.326 --> 01:18:02.887]  It's the first year of the two doctors, all in the U.S.
[01:18:02.927 --> 01:18:05.767]  legislature, with the exploding campaign in the Congress.
[01:18:06.147 --> 01:18:06.967]  Soon-to-be U.S.
[01:18:06.987 --> 01:18:15.969]  Senator from Kentucky ran to Paul2010.com, and I'm still, by the way, under only temporary cancellation of my First Amendment right for freedom to express
[01:18:16.628 --> 01:18:19.691]  That's right, I did see that in the paper.
[01:18:19.731 --> 01:18:25.635]  You've been banned from wearing any, any messages on your shirt at Travis County Commissioner's Court.
[01:18:27.016 --> 01:18:29.819]  And they won't let me show my sign at all.
[01:18:29.939 --> 01:18:32.160]  It's basically, you know, the Ron Paul sign or anything.
[01:18:32.181 --> 01:18:36.024]  Everyone should show up during Citizens Communications next week.
[01:18:36.644 --> 01:18:37.885]  What is it, Monday or Tuesday?
[01:18:38.445 --> 01:18:40.087]  It's Tuesday at 9 o'clock.
[01:18:40.652 --> 01:18:44.214]  Yeah, same as it was 10 years ago when I used to have time to go down there.
[01:18:44.654 --> 01:18:50.858]  Everybody should be down there for citizens' communications with their own Ron Paul shirts and their own InfoWars.com shirts.
[01:18:51.278 --> 01:19:02.264]  Imagine them saying no one's allowed, and you should also go videotape other people that'll have Budweiser or Ford or Chevy or Buttmaster on their shirt and sue them for discrimination.
[01:19:02.744 --> 01:19:04.505]  Well, the biggest thing is the City Council.
[01:19:04.545 --> 01:19:10.008]  I mean, at least I can get into the Travis County Commissioner's Court, but the City Council, I'm still one in every four meetings.
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:11.580]  That's my suspicion.
[01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:16.382]  They choose to allow me to have my First Amendment right 25% of the time at best.
[01:19:16.542 --> 01:19:18.542]  If I happen to get in... And that's how they phase it in.
[01:19:18.622 --> 01:19:19.523]  Soon it'll be nothing.
[01:19:19.583 --> 01:19:20.483]  I appreciate your call.
[01:19:21.443 --> 01:19:22.824]  Yeah, there's a caller there.
[01:19:22.864 --> 01:19:26.765]  I mean, all over the country they're just getting rid of citizens communications.
[01:19:26.805 --> 01:19:28.445]  They're shutting down access TV.
[01:19:28.805 --> 01:19:29.906]  They're moving in.
[01:19:29.986 --> 01:19:37.388]  Because if you're a criminal in government, and you've got police that'll do whatever they're told, you've got the people by the short hairs.
[01:19:38.933 --> 01:19:46.340]  We're going to come back and go to Mike in Chicago, Mark in California, Mike in California, Bill in Connecticut, and many others.
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:46.640]  Stay with us.
[01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:47.321]  Tons of news coming up.
[01:20:01.963 --> 01:20:03.204]  This is an emergency alert.
[01:20:03.725 --> 01:20:05.787]  People don't die of H1N1 infection.
[01:20:06.127 --> 01:20:09.150]  They die from system-wide intoxication and toxic shock.
[01:20:09.690 --> 01:20:13.934]  Doctors call it the cytokine storm following infection and immune hyperstimulation.
[01:20:14.475 --> 01:20:19.640]  Vaccines with immune stimulants or toxic drugs chemicalize your body, adding to your death risk.
[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:24.444]  Prevent death and reverse diseases from infections, vaccinations, and drug toxicity.
[01:20:24.724 --> 01:20:30.669]  Call this number to get my free special report about the flu and what to do to save lives, maybe even your own.
[01:20:31.089 --> 01:20:32.331]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz.
[01:20:32.731 --> 01:20:38.856]  Order Zeolife, the world's most powerful broad-spectrum detoxifier, immune system guard, and vaccine cleanse.
[01:20:39.216 --> 01:20:40.858]  Avoid vaccinations and drugs.
[01:20:41.238 --> 01:20:41.618]  I think?
[01:21:02.302 --> 01:21:05.968]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:21:06.329 --> 01:21:09.334]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:21:09.574 --> 01:21:10.977]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:21:11.698 --> 01:21:14.339]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:21:14.359 --> 01:21:20.600]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:25.781]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:21:26.302 --> 01:21:35.924]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:21:36.044 --> 01:21:38.166]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:21:38.406 --> 01:21:39.728]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:21:39.988 --> 01:21:42.270]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:21:42.450 --> 01:21:44.292]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:21:44.572 --> 01:21:49.397]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:21:49.717 --> 01:21:54.502]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:21:54.742 --> 01:21:58.846]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:00.931 --> 01:22:07.136]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:22:07.597 --> 01:22:15.363]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:22:15.723 --> 01:22:21.288]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt?
[01:22:21.628 --> 01:22:23.569]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[01:22:23.869 --> 01:22:28.652]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:22:28.972 --> 01:22:33.695]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:22:34.195 --> 01:22:37.917]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:22:38.517 --> 01:22:39.538]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:39.618 --> 01:22:43.722]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[01:23:59.551 --> 01:24:06.494]  It's sundown on the Union.
[01:24:06.554 --> 01:24:09.675]  We don't stop the globalists.
[01:24:16.243 --> 01:24:18.385]  We are raising the alarm worldwide.
[01:24:23.930 --> 01:24:27.073]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Chicago.
[01:24:27.153 --> 01:24:27.854]  Mike, go ahead.
[01:24:29.095 --> 01:24:29.855]  Alex, how are you?
[01:24:30.216 --> 01:24:30.516]  Good.
[01:24:32.097 --> 01:24:36.722]  I have a friend of mine who lives in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the capital city of Saudi Arabia.
[01:24:36.782 --> 01:24:39.104]  His father works for one of the princes.
[01:24:40.573 --> 01:24:43.815]  And I contacted him on Christmas to wish him a Merry Christmas.
[01:24:43.835 --> 01:24:47.257]  He's Muslim, but whatever, I'm a Christian, so, you know, it just is what it is.
[01:24:48.458 --> 01:24:54.701]  He told me that there were F-16s making strikes against Yemen for three to four days before Christmas.
[01:24:55.589 --> 01:24:58.252]  I don't know if you know anybody that can confirm that on the inside.
[01:24:58.292 --> 01:24:59.633]  Yes, I can confirm it.
[01:24:59.753 --> 01:25:01.975]  I can confirm it.
[01:25:01.995 --> 01:25:02.496]  2,000 U.S.
[01:25:02.896 --> 01:25:09.643]  Special Forces, according to the New York Times, the day before Christmas have been in the country.
[01:25:09.683 --> 01:25:11.885]  The CIA, the British have been massing.
[01:25:12.345 --> 01:25:15.488]  There have been aircraft strikes and drone strikes going on.
[01:25:16.089 --> 01:25:22.431]  For at least two years, accelerating in the month before the Christmas Day attack.
[01:25:22.691 --> 01:25:26.231]  Then they claim, though, that they're now there and attacking because of Christmas Day.
[01:25:26.251 --> 01:25:36.594]  It's like they order the body scanners the year before, they start going in in December and January, and they tell us, oh, we're putting these in because of the underwear bomber.
[01:25:38.914 --> 01:25:48.157]  It is a little odd that they're already making, he said there were F-16s flying over the city of Riyadh and on their way to Yemen for three to four days before Christmas.
[01:25:48.638 --> 01:25:54.560]  And then all of a sudden we have a guy who lights his underwear on fire that justifies everything that we do from there forward.
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:26:06.705]  And he gets walked on the plane, past the body scanners, and somebody's videotaping on the plane, and they take him off in customs, and somebody reportedly has a bomb, and the FBI lies about it, now admits they lie, but won't say why.
[01:26:07.045 --> 01:26:08.485]  Look at all the timing of this.
[01:26:10.086 --> 01:26:10.846]  God bless you, Alex.
[01:26:10.926 --> 01:26:11.627]  Take care of yourself.
[01:26:11.887 --> 01:26:13.207]  I appreciate your call, Mike.
[01:26:13.327 --> 01:26:17.609]  Yes, they admit airstrikes from piloted aircraft
[01:26:18.922 --> 01:26:21.003]  Now, you have to remember, though, they admit U.S.
[01:26:21.043 --> 01:26:22.564]  drones are attacking and U.S.
[01:26:22.624 --> 01:26:22.985]  aircraft.
[01:26:23.005 --> 01:26:23.865]  They don't specify.
[01:26:24.205 --> 01:26:27.007]  They quote the CIA and the State Department and the New York Times.
[01:26:28.288 --> 01:26:33.451]  December 24th, BBC, December 24th, Associated Press, December 24th.
[01:26:34.272 --> 01:26:35.693]  I covered those articles last week.
[01:26:36.113 --> 01:26:45.259]  I came on the air Sunday, three days after, two and a half days after the underwear attack that has everyone so scared, according to the media, and we covered those.
[01:26:46.041 --> 01:26:50.403]  But you have to remember, Saudi Arabia has bought hundreds and hundreds of F-16s.
[01:26:50.643 --> 01:26:55.325]  I mean, every few years, there's some 150 planes, 200 planes ordered.
[01:26:55.365 --> 01:26:57.246]  I mean, you've all seen that in the news.
[01:26:57.866 --> 01:27:11.432]  So, those may be Saudi Arabian F-16s, because it is confirmed that Saudi Arabian F-16s and F-15s have been bombing over the last year in northern Yemen.
[01:27:12.372 --> 01:27:13.513]  So, that's on record.
[01:27:14.606 --> 01:27:17.510]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in California.
[01:27:17.550 --> 01:27:18.371]  Mark, you're on the air.
[01:27:19.413 --> 01:27:20.354]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:27:20.654 --> 01:27:21.015]  Good, sir.
[01:27:22.396 --> 01:27:30.847]  I just want to let you know and everyone else know out there that Karl Rove is coming to the University of California Santa Barbara on February 25th.
[01:27:32.328 --> 01:27:35.150]  And that we should really get together some kind of...
[01:28:02.648 --> 01:28:05.029]  Again, when is Karl Rove sliming into town?
[01:28:06.650 --> 01:28:12.073]  February 25th, and it's going to be at Campbell Hall in the University of California, Santa Barbara.
[01:28:12.653 --> 01:28:13.733]  Okay, Mike, anything else?
[01:28:15.314 --> 01:28:16.154]  No, that's it, man.
[01:28:16.575 --> 01:28:17.735]  Just one more thing, actually.
[01:28:17.755 --> 01:28:22.818]  They call him a conservative in the newspaper here, the campus newspaper, and I just laugh at that.
[01:28:22.858 --> 01:28:27.920]  You know, he's a murderer, a fascist, and he needs to be held accountable for his war crimes.
[01:28:28.561 --> 01:28:29.601]  Well, he's more than that.
[01:28:29.681 --> 01:28:30.982]  He bankrupted our country.
[01:28:31.002 --> 01:28:32.562]  I mean, he was one of the chief little minions.
[01:28:33.562 --> 01:28:36.263]  But again, mainline conservatives, they love the end of America.
[01:28:36.583 --> 01:28:38.043]  They just want their party to be in.
[01:28:38.463 --> 01:28:41.304]  The average blue-haired Republican is a piece of garbage.
[01:28:41.844 --> 01:28:47.105]  And there's a lot of old folks and young people that are great conservatives, but they understand the Republican Party is bad.
[01:28:48.065 --> 01:28:51.766]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bill in Connecticut.
[01:28:51.826 --> 01:28:52.726]  Bill, you're on the air.
[01:28:52.746 --> 01:28:55.307]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:28:55.607 --> 01:28:55.867]  Good.
[01:28:56.347 --> 01:28:57.107]  Happy New Year to you.
[01:28:58.174 --> 01:29:06.199]  Hey, um, I was just sitting here reading this thing on MSNBC, where they have this, uh, Israel launches biometric airline security system.
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:14.664]  And I thought it was interesting that, um, you know, everybody that's on here making comments are, like, all praising these guys about how great they are, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:29:14.684 --> 01:29:16.786]  But I just have a question for you, because I know you know the answer.
[01:29:17.686 --> 01:29:26.072]  What was the name of the Israeli security company that had security of all of the airports in the United States prior to 9-11?
[01:29:27.537 --> 01:29:29.118]  They had control of a lot of them.
[01:29:29.138 --> 01:29:30.359]  There were several companies.
[01:29:30.959 --> 01:29:33.280]  And it's kind of like asking me my cousin's name.
[01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:34.521]  I'd normally know it, but I don't.
[01:29:34.821 --> 01:29:35.361]  I don't know it.
[01:29:35.381 --> 01:29:35.922]  Do you know the name?
[01:29:37.282 --> 01:29:37.963]  I wish I did.
[01:29:37.983 --> 01:29:39.063]  I don't.
[01:29:39.283 --> 01:29:42.565]  But I just think it's interesting because I'm looking at this thing here.
[01:29:42.645 --> 01:29:46.908]  It says that one of the companies they mentioned here is Fortress GB in England.
[01:29:47.448 --> 01:29:47.888]  Stay there.
[01:29:48.088 --> 01:29:48.488]  Stay there.
[01:29:49.189 --> 01:29:49.469]  Stay there.
[01:29:49.489 --> 01:29:50.209]  We'll come back to you.
[01:29:51.650 --> 01:29:52.631]  We're on the march.
[01:29:53.051 --> 01:29:54.552]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.567 --> 01:29:58.328]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.669 --> 01:30:04.890]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:05.210 --> 01:30:05.831]  Number one.
[01:30:06.131 --> 01:30:09.272]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.552 --> 01:30:10.112]  Number two.
[01:30:10.412 --> 01:30:14.954]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:15.294 --> 01:30:15.754]  It's true.
[01:30:16.034 --> 01:30:20.616]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:20.916 --> 01:30:21.436]  Number three.
[01:30:21.736 --> 01:30:25.018]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:25.319 --> 01:30:29.021]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:29.242 --> 01:30:29.782]  Number 4.
[01:30:30.022 --> 01:30:32.404]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.784 --> 01:30:36.187]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:36.467 --> 01:30:37.007]  Number 5.
[01:30:37.267 --> 01:30:41.190]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:41.410 --> 01:30:46.174]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:30:46.454 --> 01:30:50.501]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:50.621 --> 01:30:52.204]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:52.424 --> 01:30:54.508]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:30:54.668 --> 01:30:57.012]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:31:01.087 --> 01:31:03.688]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:04.108 --> 01:31:09.070]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:11.170]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:11.471 --> 01:31:16.292]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:16.472 --> 01:31:17.433]  How much do you want?
[01:31:17.653 --> 01:31:18.413]  When do you want it?
[01:31:18.793 --> 01:31:20.374]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:20.674 --> 01:31:21.494]  When will you need it?
[01:31:21.734 --> 01:31:23.795]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:23.935 --> 01:31:25.055]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:25.275 --> 01:31:26.616]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:26.816 --> 01:31:27.156]  If there's a
[01:31:27.176 --> 01:31:29.177]  You're in quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[01:31:29.337 --> 01:31:31.878]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:32.059 --> 01:31:35.260]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:35.660 --> 01:31:39.162]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:39.462 --> 01:31:40.463]  How much will you need?
[01:31:40.703 --> 01:31:41.323]  We don't know.
[01:31:41.604 --> 01:31:42.524]  How much do you want?
[01:31:42.704 --> 01:31:43.424]  All you can get.
[01:31:43.444 --> 01:31:44.325]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:44.725 --> 01:31:47.488]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:31:47.768 --> 01:31:49.530]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:49.550 --> 01:31:50.471]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:06.904]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:32:07.024 --> 01:32:08.985]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[01:32:09.126 --> 01:32:11.247]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:32:11.367 --> 01:32:12.888]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:32:13.008 --> 01:32:17.351]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[01:32:17.491 --> 01:32:19.872]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[01:32:20.072 --> 01:32:24.695]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.

[01:32:30.859 --> 01:32:33.580]  The Ecola Blue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:36.302]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[01:32:36.402 --> 01:32:43.566]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[01:32:43.866 --> 01:32:47.550]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling Ecolablue at 1-800-691-6043.
[01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:47.830]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:32:47.850 --> 01:32:49.772]  Or visit Ecolablue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:33:10.347 --> 01:33:17.531]  Alright, I'm going to take the next five calls in line, then I'm going to blitz through a bunch of important news that continue with calls.
[01:33:18.232 --> 01:33:31.200]  I'm going to have Aaron Dykes in studio with me some on eugenics and some video clips of these eugenicists openly calling for the mass extermination of society.
[01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:38.905]  Actual video of George Bernard Shaw talking about this and others.
[01:33:39.955 --> 01:33:53.826]  So that is coming up and the caller was just now bringing up Israeli security firms.
[01:33:55.187 --> 01:34:02.032]  My issue with this is, we're going back to him in a moment, my issue with this is that
[01:34:03.507 --> 01:34:05.748]  Israel's been caught spying on the United States.
[01:34:06.428 --> 01:34:20.634]  Israel has been caught over and over and over again taking sensitive military technology, guidance systems, aircraft systems, missile systems, armor systems, and giving it to the Communist Chinese and Russians.
[01:34:20.714 --> 01:34:31.418]  In fact, the other day I was going to cover this some, did some research, well I did some re-research, went and pulled up stuff I already knew was there, to cover it on the radio show and they never got to it.
[01:34:32.196 --> 01:34:39.520]  So I want my crew right now to Google this online in front of everyone.
[01:34:43.582 --> 01:34:45.764]  Israel sold U.S.
[01:34:45.784 --> 01:34:46.784]  technology to China.
[01:34:48.165 --> 01:35:00.052]  You type that in, you get literally hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of mainstream CBS, ABC, CNN, where Israel has been caught selling everything under the sun
[01:35:01.678 --> 01:35:11.547]  AWACS radars, computers, our government sells them more advanced jets than we've got, and then they give it to China.
[01:35:12.588 --> 01:35:15.851]  And then, oh, well, you can't talk about the wonderful little ally Israel.
[01:35:16.072 --> 01:35:17.733]  Israel is a criminal operation.
[01:35:18.073 --> 01:35:19.134]  So is the United States.
[01:35:19.195 --> 01:35:19.855]  So is England.
[01:35:19.915 --> 01:35:20.616]  So is China.
[01:35:21.276 --> 01:35:22.718]  What do the Founding Fathers teach us?
[01:35:22.738 --> 01:35:25.721]  99% of the time, governments are criminal.
[01:35:27.025 --> 01:35:33.688]  But Israel makes itself look good up against Iran and other tyrannies like Saudi Arabia.
[01:35:33.728 --> 01:35:34.928]  Well, yeah, they're bad too!
[01:35:35.908 --> 01:35:38.449]  See, that's what's so illogical about this.
[01:35:38.469 --> 01:35:43.651]  The government says, give all your rights up or terrorists are going to get you.
[01:35:48.493 --> 01:35:51.375]  Israel secretly sells American nuclear weapons to China.
[01:35:52.235 --> 01:35:52.575]  U.S.
[01:35:53.055 --> 01:35:54.876]  arms sales to Israel end up in China.
[01:35:56.474 --> 01:35:56.754]  U.S.
[01:35:56.894 --> 01:36:06.379]  anger at Israeli weapons sale, BBC, Harots, that's out of Israel, I guess they're anti-semitic, selling arms to China or not, Harots, and then you read the article, they admit it.
[01:36:06.699 --> 01:36:10.141]  New York Times, Israel sells arms to China, U.S.
[01:36:10.181 --> 01:36:10.561]  says.
[01:36:11.782 --> 01:36:12.962]  How many hits did that get?
[01:36:13.363 --> 01:36:18.065]  Three hundred and ninety thousand.
[01:36:22.514 --> 01:36:26.317]  390,000.
[01:36:23.935 --> 01:36:26.317]  I'm looking at that across the room.
[01:36:26.377 --> 01:36:27.938]  Is that 390,000 or 390 million?
[01:36:28.458 --> 01:36:30.740]  Yeah, it's 390,000.
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:34.543]  390,000 hits on Israel sells weapons to China.
[01:36:36.925 --> 01:36:39.187]  And they sign agreements that they won't sell it, and they do.
[01:36:39.527 --> 01:36:42.590]  Why is Israel running a lot of the NSA equipment?
[01:36:42.630 --> 01:36:45.552]  Why does Israel get to run things that our own government isn't trusted with?
[01:36:45.912 --> 01:36:47.093]  Why do they get to guard U.S.
[01:36:47.153 --> 01:36:47.854]  nuclear weapons?
[01:36:49.707 --> 01:36:53.129]  Why are they one of the biggest contractors training Homeland Security?
[01:36:53.169 --> 01:36:56.392]  That was in the Associated Press and Jerusalem Post two weeks ago.
[01:36:56.692 --> 01:37:02.176]  Why does Interpol get more immunity, that's Europe and the rest of the planet, in the U.S.
[01:37:02.336 --> 01:37:03.256]  than our own police?
[01:37:04.897 --> 01:37:05.558]  It's a joke!
[01:37:05.898 --> 01:37:06.479]  The U.N.
[01:37:06.519 --> 01:37:11.022]  and others just give themselves all this immunity and we just fall down in front of them.
[01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:15.242]  I'm going back to your calls in a moment, but on that subject I wanted to make that point.
[01:37:16.022 --> 01:37:20.344]  Let me now go ahead and tell you about a few of the sponsors that made today's radio show possible.
[01:37:20.944 --> 01:37:23.206]  One of them is MySolarBackup.
[01:37:25.227 --> 01:37:28.688]  Have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[01:37:28.788 --> 01:37:31.610]  If so, you should check out MySolarBackup.com because there's a
[01:37:32.521 --> 01:37:37.946]  Never been a better time to start getting off the grid and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[01:37:37.986 --> 01:37:38.426]  Here's why.
[01:37:38.946 --> 01:37:42.689]  Plug and play solar generators are now available from Solutions from Science.
[01:37:43.170 --> 01:37:44.971]  And my listeners have been getting these for over two years now.
[01:37:44.991 --> 01:37:45.352]  They love them.
[01:37:45.712 --> 01:37:47.814]  The portable power systems need no installation.
[01:37:47.894 --> 01:37:51.777]  Supply household current wherever and whenever you need it.
[01:37:51.817 --> 01:37:55.120]  Producing electricity directly from the sun and storing it in a little battery system.
[01:37:55.808 --> 01:37:59.270]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly and emits no fumes.
[01:37:59.770 --> 01:38:03.552]  It's like having your own electrical power plant and it's perfect for your home or your campsite.
[01:38:03.572 --> 01:38:06.093]  You can get a bunch of them and run your whole house.
[01:38:06.733 --> 01:38:12.676]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:38:13.036 --> 01:38:16.758]  So go to MySolarBackup.com to request a free information package today.
[01:38:17.138 --> 01:38:18.158]  That's MySolarBackup.com or 877-327-0365.
[01:38:18.178 --> 01:38:18.518]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:38:25.393 --> 01:38:27.874]  Also, I want to tell you about DigiNet.net.
[01:38:28.274 --> 01:38:35.276]  They've got a lot of great little hidden video camera pens, hidden video camera sunglasses that have the little memory chip in the sunglasses.
[01:38:35.916 --> 01:38:39.837]  Great way, because you know what the camera's shooting from where you turn your head.
[01:38:39.897 --> 01:38:40.957]  That's my favorite system.
[01:38:41.417 --> 01:38:43.318]  They're all available at DigiNet.net.
[01:38:43.338 --> 01:38:45.178]  They are a huge supplier and retailer.
[01:38:45.218 --> 01:38:46.538]  They sell to the government, you name it.
[01:38:46.858 --> 01:38:48.219]  So you get an incredibly low price.
[01:38:48.259 --> 01:38:51.200]  You're going right to a big wholesaler and their patriots.
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:51.780]  DigiNet.net.
[01:38:53.140 --> 01:38:54.001]  DigiNet.net.
[01:38:54.041 --> 01:38:55.182]  I love the pin as well.
[01:38:55.862 --> 01:38:59.145]  That's DigiNet.net or click on the banner at InfoWars.com.
[01:38:59.185 --> 01:39:02.328]  That's D-I-G-A-N-E-T.net.
[01:39:03.129 --> 01:39:07.893]  And their phone number is also on their website if you'd like to give them a call.
[01:39:08.334 --> 01:39:09.275]  Again, that's DigiNet.net.
[01:39:11.457 --> 01:39:12.818]  Okay, let's go back to your calls.
[01:39:12.898 --> 01:39:14.919]  I'm going to get into all this news I haven't even covered yet.
[01:39:15.279 --> 01:39:15.760]  Okay, sir.
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:17.221]  Finish up.
[01:39:17.501 --> 01:39:18.522]  Paul Burmison here.
[01:39:18.582 --> 01:39:19.682]  He made Fabled Enemies.
[01:39:21.023 --> 01:39:25.246]  All, I mean, I'd say 30-40% of the two-hour film is about the Israel connection.
[01:39:26.106 --> 01:39:28.228]  Israel, the U.S., Britain, they're all joined at the hip.
[01:39:28.268 --> 01:39:30.789]  It's all the same thing with these intelligence agencies.
[01:39:31.150 --> 01:39:39.415]  Jason, a caller called in, Bill in Connecticut, I believe, and he was asking me, there were several of them, and I don't want to get this wrong,
[01:39:40.529 --> 01:39:42.112]  My memory is failing me right now.
[01:39:43.616 --> 01:39:49.809]  There's the Israeli company that's even in mainstream news that runs 90 plus percent of all caller ID checks in the country.
[01:39:51.544 --> 01:39:53.846]  Start over, they didn't have your mic on, go ahead.
[01:39:54.006 --> 01:40:05.336]  Yeah, the two companies that handle basically all the telecommunications in the United States are Amdocs and Converse, and I want to think that the establishment the guy was talking about is Odigo Securities.
[01:40:05.576 --> 01:40:08.418]  They're the ones that had the lease for another, I believe, eight years.
[01:40:08.438 --> 01:40:18.707]  No, no, Odigo was the big instant message company that sold it and changed the name, and it was in the Jerusalem Post that, it's not a rumor, that they called their employees to get out of the building four hours before.
[01:40:19.147 --> 01:40:20.468]  And that was also in the AP.
[01:40:22.250 --> 01:40:25.493]  But again, the executives all talked about it publicly, showing they weren't involved.
[01:40:26.173 --> 01:40:28.295]  And I'm not saying there weren't elements of Israel involved somehow.
[01:40:28.315 --> 01:40:30.677]  The point is, is I'm saying Israel didn't go it alone.
[01:40:30.697 --> 01:40:33.259]  It doesn't reduce guilt on anybody.
[01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:35.001]  It's saying it's a huge operation.
[01:40:35.281 --> 01:40:37.243]  Just like LBJ was involved in U.S.S.
[01:40:37.283 --> 01:40:38.184]  Liberty, so was Israel.
[01:40:38.504 --> 01:40:38.984]  Absolutely.
[01:40:39.005 --> 01:40:41.447]  It's like if two guys rob a bank, they're both equally guilty.
[01:40:42.087 --> 01:40:51.115]  The ADL-controlled white supremacist groups get mad at us and want to make it only an anti-Semitic deal so it doesn't become a mainstream media item and become kosher and acceptable to talk about.
[01:40:51.335 --> 01:40:56.259]  No, but what's the one that had the majority of contracts over airport security?
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:06.728]  Now, I know that Marvin Bush's company and Jeb Bush had companies over the major airports the hijackers came from, and the food service onto the planes, and the security on the towers.
[01:41:07.369 --> 01:41:07.909]  Here's what's
[01:41:27.265 --> 01:41:35.831]  Every major intelligence operation we had from secret offices, the Secret Service, the CIA, the FBI, the list went on in that Fox report.
[01:41:35.851 --> 01:41:41.655]  And again, your film Fabled Enemies has the Fox News clips, the C-SPAN, the congressional admissions.
[01:41:41.695 --> 01:41:42.716]  This is not our opinion.
[01:41:42.896 --> 01:41:44.337]  No, it's absolutely not our opinion.
[01:41:44.397 --> 01:41:48.821]  It's one piece of an international intelligence operation that continues to this day.
[01:41:49.001 --> 01:41:50.682]  If you look at Iran-Contra, for example.
[01:41:51.042 --> 01:41:57.290]  You've got Israel, you've got the Brits, you've got the U.S., you've got Latin American countries, and you've got the Iranians.
[01:41:57.430 --> 01:41:59.513]  And Israel was used for plausible deniability.
[01:41:59.833 --> 01:42:04.019]  Israel would actually purchase the weapons so the United States didn't have to do that part.
[01:42:04.059 --> 01:42:07.703]  We would take those weapons, ship them down, and then pay Israel later.
[01:42:09.085 --> 01:42:10.086]  That's how governments compartmentalize.
[01:42:27.327 --> 01:42:29.008]  Look at the Pakistani ISI.
[01:42:29.209 --> 01:42:36.295]  This was literally set up by British intelligence and then revamped by US intelligence and covert operations in the late 70s and 80s.
[01:42:36.495 --> 01:42:39.437]  And then they're the ones funding the hijackers prior to 9-11.
[01:42:39.497 --> 01:42:41.619]  All right, good job.
[01:42:41.659 --> 01:42:42.400]  Thank you so much.
[01:42:43.180 --> 01:42:45.843]  Again, Bill, does that answer your question?
[01:42:47.024 --> 01:42:49.125]  Yeah, no, I just thought it was interesting.
[01:42:49.145 --> 01:42:55.671]  Like I said, this article that's here on MSNBC today talking about, you know, Israel launches biometric airline security system.
[01:42:56.522 --> 01:43:04.708]  It's like, you know, they turn around and take your passport, your fingerprint, and like with the other guy, there was another guy that called in earlier, sitting there saying something about the whole biometric thing.
[01:43:05.369 --> 01:43:11.373]  But I mean, it's like, you know, if people turn around and get ticked off at this whole, you know, body scan thing, which personally, I will never fly.
[01:43:11.974 --> 01:43:12.974]  I mean, that's it.
[01:43:13.014 --> 01:43:18.739]  I just sat there and said, you know what, if that's the way it's going to be, because it's already humiliating enough that you've got to go in there, you're not even a bad guy.
[01:43:19.199 --> 01:43:22.281]  And they're frisking you, checking you out, this, that, the other thing.
[01:43:22.842 --> 01:43:23.962]  And it's like, you know, forget about it.
[01:43:24.283 --> 01:43:24.743]  Why fly?
[01:43:26.385 --> 01:43:29.895]  They sit there and say that they don't want to have this, and they'll say, oh, well, let's go to this company.
[01:43:30.837 --> 01:43:32.742]  And the next thing you know, this company's got the contract.
[01:43:33.365 --> 01:43:36.687]  And then you've got Chertoff, who's an admitted Israeli double agent.
[01:43:36.727 --> 01:43:41.851]  His father and mother were founders of the Mossad, and he's making all this money.
[01:43:41.891 --> 01:43:43.832]  We're really being taken advantage of, and it's wrong.
[01:43:43.853 --> 01:43:45.374]  I appreciate your call.
[01:43:46.014 --> 01:43:51.518]  Israel tests new technology that could reduce airport security checks and make flights safer.
[01:43:52.379 --> 01:43:55.961]  And so what Israel's saying is, they haven't had an incident in over a decade.
[01:43:55.981 --> 01:43:56.341]  In 2002, a guy forgot
[01:43:59.540 --> 01:44:00.481]  Uh, to check a gun.
[01:44:00.782 --> 01:44:02.383]  Somebody was allowed to fly but he forgot to check it.
[01:44:02.824 --> 01:44:04.005]  And then he later reported himself.
[01:44:04.426 --> 01:44:07.469]  They never have any instances because they do profile.
[01:44:07.750 --> 01:44:11.974]  And they do have some real Arab terrorists over there that do want to get on planes.
[01:44:11.994 --> 01:44:12.935]  I mean, some of that is real.
[01:44:14.095 --> 01:44:19.619]  And Israel hasn't had an incident in over a decade, other than the 2002 gun incident where it was an accident.
[01:44:20.100 --> 01:44:24.763]  I mean, Jimmy Jones of the Cowboys twice brought guns on planes accidentally, forgetting.
[01:44:25.203 --> 01:44:27.425]  I mean, anybody who's got a brain has a gun in their briefcase.
[01:44:28.326 --> 01:44:33.510]  And I've forgotten before and been at the airport, noticed a pocket knife and just trashed it.
[01:44:34.270 --> 01:44:36.792]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Mike in California.
[01:44:36.812 --> 01:44:38.012]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:03.782]  Hey Alex, I had a couple of questions.
[01:45:04.262 --> 01:45:11.707]  Could you elaborate on what you know of some of the odd underground weapons you know that the elite may be working on?
[01:45:11.767 --> 01:45:17.451]  Stuff like Project Blue Bean and other stuff that you probably know of, but I guess you rarely talk about.
[01:45:17.551 --> 01:45:26.978]  And the other question is, how much will race play in how the elite envision the world they want to make or create in the future?
[01:45:28.803 --> 01:45:41.958]  Race plays a central role in Divide and Conquer, playing different groups off against each other, with the government playing the part of the referee and judge that keeps everyone in line while their private foundations play everyone off against each other.
[01:45:44.981 --> 01:45:48.923]  Disagreed with George Bernard Shaw, who they both admired each other.
[01:45:49.323 --> 01:45:54.966]  Bernard Shaw said, do IQ test and kill everyone with under a 90 IQ.
[01:45:55.446 --> 01:46:02.289]  And then, over time, phase it up to 100 and make a super race, kill everyone who isn't a good socialist, break up the family.
[01:46:02.849 --> 01:46:07.211]  Hitler said, I agree with that, but we're only going to kill the sub-racists.
[01:46:07.812 --> 01:46:12.834]  And then later, we're going to start culling only the ultra-superior Aryan.
[01:46:14.551 --> 01:46:41.474]  and they made a deal with the uh... emperor of japan who was obsessed with eugenics that's mainline history said the japanese will rule asia as the master race and the germans with the british the germans actually believe the british you really read hitler and gerbil's writings where the ultra supreme undefiled uh... arian because there have been so many eastern european and arab many arabs even went into western europe and so they believe that
[01:46:41.934 --> 01:46:47.057]  That even the Germans were not as ultra-pure as a certain strain of British.
[01:46:47.077 --> 01:46:50.639]  That's where the term British comes from, is a tribe known as the British.
[01:46:50.999 --> 01:46:53.461]  And it's all complete hogwash.
[01:46:55.342 --> 01:46:58.824]  Again, you can't even single out the British as a distinct tribe.
[01:46:59.104 --> 01:47:02.566]  All those Germanic tribes were always killing and ranging and running around.
[01:47:02.606 --> 01:47:05.268]  But England is as Germanic as you can get.
[01:47:05.808 --> 01:47:08.510]  I mean, in the genetic studies that have been done,
[01:47:09.651 --> 01:47:16.084]  Because they all came from the Gauls in France, and from Germania, and from the Vikings in Northern Europe.
[01:47:16.645 --> 01:47:20.572]  They all came and waged war in England for thousands of years.
[01:47:22.230 --> 01:47:24.191]  Thousands of years before the Romans showed up.
[01:47:24.251 --> 01:47:29.154]  It was just continual slaughter going on as the Germanic tribes killed each other.
[01:47:29.755 --> 01:47:35.438]  And so out of all this lore, that's why Hitler cried when he had to bomb London, they said.
[01:47:36.038 --> 01:47:38.580]  And the British flew over and bombed Berlin.
[01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:43.403]  Hitler wouldn't bomb population centers because the British Aryans were too precious.
[01:47:43.863 --> 01:47:48.086]  But then Churchill said, we've got to get British resolve behind this.
[01:47:48.686 --> 01:47:53.449]  And so they sent a bunch of liberators, a squadron of liberators, to bomb civilian centers.
[01:47:53.469 --> 01:47:54.450]  This is mainline history.
[01:47:54.470 --> 01:47:55.431]  I've seen this on History Channel.
[01:47:56.632 --> 01:48:00.995]  To bomb Berlin.
[01:48:02.016 --> 01:48:03.617]  And so Hitler started the blitz.
[01:48:04.077 --> 01:48:10.021]  And he cried, oh his precious Aryans were dying, his precious the Brits, oh, oh it's horrible.
[01:48:10.542 --> 01:48:13.524]  I mean, this is how sick these people are, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48:17.688 --> 01:48:32.319]  Whenever he flooded the bunkers and the subways so the Russians couldn't use it, so he'd have a few more hours in his bunker, he said, well, I guess our Aryans weren't as good as their Aryans, and now I'm just worried the Russian Mongols will take over.
[01:48:32.399 --> 01:48:33.100]  Oh, this is horrible.
[01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:34.561]  Let me take cyanide.
[01:48:35.562 --> 01:48:47.271]  I mean, when you really know the history, folks, and not some skewed history, I have read, no exaggeration, over a hundred thick history books, secret wartime reports, Nazi books,
[01:48:48.433 --> 01:48:49.413]  It's well more than a hundred.
[01:48:49.433 --> 01:48:54.914]  I've probably read 30 or 40 books by Joseph Goebbels, by Adolf Hitler, okay?
[01:48:55.295 --> 01:48:56.695]  These are books published by them.
[01:48:56.715 --> 01:48:57.795]  This is not propaganda.
[01:48:58.875 --> 01:49:00.196]  Hitler was a communist.
[01:49:00.676 --> 01:49:02.416]  Joseph Goebbels was a communist.
[01:49:02.536 --> 01:49:05.177]  They wanted communism, but it wasn't popular.
[01:49:05.577 --> 01:49:10.798]  And when British intelligence was funding them, they wanted their own brand of communism to block Russian communism.
[01:49:12.768 --> 01:49:17.091]  And then they became from National Socialist to Fascist and then became Anti-Communist.
[01:49:17.451 --> 01:49:18.512]  And that's all on record.
[01:49:20.713 --> 01:49:25.496]  And Stalin admired Hitler, Hitler admired Stalin, they made a deal to divide Poland up.
[01:49:25.936 --> 01:49:28.658]  I mean, when you really know history.
[01:49:28.758 --> 01:49:34.642]  And so, George Bernard Shaw, who we'll be talking about later in the next hour, he
[01:49:36.049 --> 01:49:44.756]  He said, through the health departments, we're going to ban homeschooling, we're going to start with sterilization and drugging the water, and then we're just going to start killing everybody.
[01:49:45.796 --> 01:50:00.808]  And he and Hitler exchanged letters, Shaw went and had repeated meetings, he had meetings with the head of IBM, Dr. Thomas Watson, and they all just said, well, the Soviets are putting fluoride in, that's sterilizing and brain damaging people, let's do that.
[01:50:01.633 --> 01:50:04.855]  But they couldn't get that done until 1946 in the United States.
[01:50:05.136 --> 01:50:06.497]  And they all wrote books.
[01:50:06.577 --> 01:50:07.137]  We own them.
[01:50:07.557 --> 01:50:09.799]  And they all gave film interviews.
[01:50:09.899 --> 01:50:12.341]  I mean, I could play Hitler and video of him saying it.
[01:50:13.282 --> 01:50:14.142]  Film, put to video.
[01:50:14.202 --> 01:50:15.843]  I mean, we're going to play Shaw coming up.
[01:50:16.804 --> 01:50:22.889]  Now, again, this audio was filmed in the 20s, this film, right when they were getting audio and film.
[01:50:23.649 --> 01:50:26.111]  And so, I mean, it's bad audio.
[01:50:26.851 --> 01:50:28.633]  But you can read books he wrote saying it.
[01:50:29.932 --> 01:50:32.794]  And so all of this is to kill you.
[01:50:33.755 --> 01:50:34.735]  Kill you.
[01:50:34.976 --> 01:50:36.617]  Get it through your heads, folks.
[01:50:39.439 --> 01:50:40.419]  No exaggeration.
[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:45.403]  I would bet that Aaron Dykes has read more than 50.
[01:50:45.623 --> 01:50:47.945]  I know he bought more than 50 and he's always reading them.
[01:50:48.845 --> 01:50:51.767]  Books on eugenics by the eugenicist.
[01:50:52.588 --> 01:50:54.629]  And they are running everything today.
[01:50:55.590 --> 01:50:59.473]  And they are mad dog control freak psychopathic murderers.
[01:51:01.553 --> 01:51:05.814]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[01:51:06.175 --> 01:51:13.717]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over four years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey guy offers amazing specials for Berkey water systems.

[01:52:02.148 --> 01:52:05.793]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:52:06.174 --> 01:52:09.178]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:52:09.419 --> 01:52:10.821]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:52:11.545 --> 01:52:14.186]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:52:14.206 --> 01:52:20.429]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:52:20.589 --> 01:52:25.631]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:52:26.152 --> 01:52:35.756]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:52:35.896 --> 01:52:37.997]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:52:38.237 --> 01:52:39.557]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:52:39.837 --> 01:52:42.098]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:52:42.278 --> 01:52:44.119]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:52:44.419 --> 01:52:49.180]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:52:49.561 --> 01:52:54.342]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[01:53:05.336 --> 01:53:06.357]  Afraid to answer it?
[01:53:07.298 --> 01:53:08.759]  Afraid to answer your door?
[01:53:09.179 --> 01:53:16.205]  Did you know that debt settlement, bankruptcy, and attorneys will cost you about ten times more than you would legally be required to pay creditors?
[01:53:16.485 --> 01:53:18.527]  These are not ways to help you get out of debt.
[01:53:18.707 --> 01:53:20.488]  They are expensive payment plans.
[01:53:20.729 --> 01:53:25.232]  And if you're in debt already, does it make sense to load yourself up with another payment plan?
[01:53:25.572 --> 01:53:29.736]  Zero Debt in 90 Days gets you out of debt in 90 days, guaranteed.
[01:53:29.956 --> 01:53:32.318]  And that's the website you need to visit right now.
[01:53:35.438 --> 01:53:35.878]  I think so.
[01:54:01.841 --> 01:54:04.603]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:54:04.623 --> 01:54:08.526]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:16.111 --> 01:54:23.996]  To answer the caller's second question about secret government weapons, they have space planes with DU, meteor gun systems.
[01:54:25.157 --> 01:54:28.319]  That's the way Dr. Bob Bowman, the former head of Star Wars program, described it.
[01:54:29.266 --> 01:54:30.547]  They had particle beam weapons.
[01:54:30.667 --> 01:54:40.674]  Blue beam isn't a weapon system, it's a psych warfare system, which is a partially declassified program to have fake alien invasions or Buddha or Muhammad or Jesus return.
[01:54:41.294 --> 01:54:45.377]  That's even been in mainstream news that they've developed that, but a lot of it's secret.
[01:54:46.338 --> 01:54:54.023]  And a lot of different technologies are 10, 20, 30, 40 years more advanced than what the public is told about.
[01:54:54.524 --> 01:54:58.687]  And things are slowly doled out to the public that
[01:54:59.818 --> 01:55:02.060]  Intensifies the tracking and control grid.
[01:55:02.861 --> 01:55:12.910]  So we are in a controlled scientific dictatorship, but consciousness, awareness of that allows us to expose it and take control of the system.
[01:55:13.431 --> 01:55:16.013]  Let's talk to Robin in Holland.
[01:55:16.374 --> 01:55:17.274]  You're on the air, Robin.
[01:55:17.315 --> 01:55:17.935]  Thanks for holding.
[01:55:19.497 --> 01:55:20.157]  Hello, Alex.
[01:55:20.678 --> 01:55:21.979]  I'm Robin from William James Holland.
[01:55:22.620 --> 01:55:23.000]  Welcome.
[01:55:24.261 --> 01:55:25.162]  Hey, thanks for having me.
[01:55:27.469 --> 01:55:28.689]  What's on your mind?
[01:55:29.569 --> 01:55:32.010]  I've sent you an email, a message, via the site.
[01:55:32.630 --> 01:55:36.571]  We just figured we'd be a change, like... We're an activism group, by the way.
[01:55:37.091 --> 01:55:37.631]  You know us.
[01:55:38.132 --> 01:55:38.712]  I guess you do.
[01:55:40.292 --> 01:55:52.835]  We have a lot of snow, and we have global warming, and the IPCC, and everybody and everything is warming up, but we have a lot of snow here in the Netherlands, and that's really, it's the first in years that we have snow here in this amount.
[01:55:54.174 --> 01:55:56.478]  And I just launched a new idea.
[01:55:56.899 --> 01:56:00.947]  What if we would all make snowmen for Al Gore?
[01:56:01.688 --> 01:56:04.533]  With a little sign with it, you know, that says, I love CO2.
[01:56:08.132 --> 01:56:09.193]  Yeah, that's a good idea.
[01:56:09.233 --> 01:56:11.174]  I mean, all sorts of media stunts.
[01:56:11.734 --> 01:56:12.875]  Post them on YouTube.
[01:56:13.215 --> 01:56:15.017]  Conservatively, thousands will see it.
[01:56:15.477 --> 01:56:16.558]  Millions, potentially.
[01:56:17.038 --> 01:56:35.811]  And if everybody just becomes activist on the web and in person, that way you have a physical protest that people see on the street, then it's seen on the web, then others mimic it, until we all stand up together and figure out that we're the majority, and all the sheep that feel like they're alone and isolated, they end up waking up as well.
[01:56:36.211 --> 01:56:37.992]  That's the process of awakening.
[01:56:39.093 --> 01:56:41.835]  Exactly, and we just thought this was a nice idea, you know.
[01:56:42.475 --> 01:56:44.536]  People can do this together, they can do it in groups.
[01:56:44.877 --> 01:56:48.499]  But for all... I don't care, they can create an whole army of snowmen, you know.
[01:56:48.559 --> 01:56:52.782]  Put an old sign on top of it with, uh, El Gore, we're coming for you, or something.
[01:56:53.162 --> 01:56:55.023]  It's just gonna be a lot of fun.
[01:56:55.143 --> 01:56:56.664]  You can do a lot of things with this.
[01:56:57.045 --> 01:56:58.926]  And we've put up a link on the website.
[01:56:59.026 --> 01:57:00.747]  I've also sent you the email, the link to it.
[01:57:00.847 --> 01:57:03.589]  It's on, uh, wacholland.org.
[01:57:03.609 --> 01:57:05.110]  Uh, that's our website.
[01:57:05.130 --> 01:57:07.912]  Our website is, for short, WeAreChangeHolland.
[01:57:08.779 --> 01:57:09.920]  Um, and it's right in front.
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:10.841]  Everybody can see it.
[01:57:11.101 --> 01:57:15.565]  And we will create a photo album where everybody can upload their own pictures they've made and stuff.
[01:57:15.945 --> 01:57:17.346]  So people can vote and, uh...
[01:57:17.748 --> 01:57:22.170]  We're thinking about putting the best thing on our website on the front page for a couple of weeks.
[01:57:22.250 --> 01:57:27.151]  You could have the snowmen with signs like record cold temperatures in the last hundred years.
[01:57:27.632 --> 01:57:29.852]  Some areas record cold the last 25.
[01:57:30.673 --> 01:57:31.833]  Got global warming.
[01:57:32.493 --> 01:57:34.214]  We're coming for you Al Gore.
[01:57:34.254 --> 01:57:35.974]  We're gonna give you a snowball.
[01:57:36.375 --> 01:57:37.035]  Absolutely.
[01:57:37.075 --> 01:57:37.655]  Great points.
[01:57:37.795 --> 01:57:38.855]  Good to hear from you Robin.
[01:57:39.456 --> 01:57:41.676]  Let's talk to Terrence in Detroit.
[01:57:42.077 --> 01:57:42.897]  Terrence go ahead.
[01:57:43.632 --> 01:57:45.093]  Hey Alex, I hope I can fit it in.
[01:57:45.113 --> 01:57:49.835]  I got to talk to James Conboy there in New York about the Tresse family.
[01:57:50.936 --> 01:57:57.099]  I got through to him on his lunch break, and basically I just asked him to read the Constitution and set them free.
[01:57:57.119 --> 01:58:04.123]  He got into a discussion on how they should be educating their children and everything, and I asked him
[01:58:05.094 --> 01:58:13.239]  If you really wanted to help them, why didn't you knock on their door and offer them a better way to teach their kids to read instead of arresting them and forcing them to jump through hoops?
[01:58:13.659 --> 01:58:14.640]  And what did he say to that?
[01:58:15.321 --> 01:58:16.461]  Well, he said, I didn't arrest them.
[01:58:16.601 --> 01:58:20.584]  And I said that you didn't order them to be set free, so you're part of the arresting process.
[01:58:21.304 --> 01:58:24.847]  I said, basically it was just set them free, let them go.
[01:58:24.887 --> 01:58:26.728]  Did he say he's getting a lot of phone calls?
[01:58:29.240 --> 01:58:30.582]  No, he didn't mention his phone calls.
[01:58:30.602 --> 01:58:32.844]  He wanted my name, but I just said my name is irrelevant.
[01:58:33.445 --> 01:58:35.507]  I'm just a concerned citizen that wants people to be safe.
[01:58:35.527 --> 01:58:36.048]  Stay there.
[01:58:36.248 --> 01:58:36.648]  Stay there.
[01:58:36.688 --> 01:58:38.250]  We'll talk about this case when we come back.
[01:58:38.330 --> 01:58:38.991]  Stay with us.
[01:58:42.995 --> 01:58:45.098]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.598 --> 01:58:48.782]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.697 --> 01:58:54.939]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:55.259 --> 01:58:55.879]  Number one.
[01:58:56.160 --> 01:58:59.321]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:59.581 --> 01:59:00.162]  Number two.
[01:59:00.442 --> 01:59:04.984]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:05.344 --> 01:59:05.784]  It's true.
[01:59:06.084 --> 01:59:10.647]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:10.947 --> 01:59:11.407]  Number three.
[01:59:11.767 --> 01:59:15.050]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:15.350 --> 01:59:19.834]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:20.074 --> 01:59:22.436]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:22.836 --> 01:59:26.219]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:27.300 --> 01:59:31.244]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:31.444 --> 01:59:36.208]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:36.488 --> 01:59:40.530]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:40.650 --> 01:59:42.230]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:42.450 --> 01:59:44.531]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:59:44.711 --> 01:59:47.052]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:00:11.758 --> 02:00:19.944]  Okay, I'm going to take a few more calls right now.
[02:00:19.964 --> 02:00:21.865]  Then I'm going to blitz through news in the next segment.
[02:00:21.885 --> 02:00:24.787]  Then Aaron Dice is going to be in studio with us on some key issues.
[02:00:24.807 --> 02:00:26.168]  You'll want to stay with us for that.
[02:00:28.069 --> 02:00:30.531]  Because you need to read the writings of Margaret Sanger.
[02:00:30.551 --> 02:00:34.733]  You need to read the writings of Bertrand Russell, George Bernard Shaw.
[02:00:35.194 --> 02:00:35.634]  All of them.
[02:00:36.695 --> 02:00:38.616]  Aldous Huxley, Julian Huxley.
[02:00:38.936 --> 02:00:39.857]  Hundreds of them.
[02:00:40.965 --> 02:00:42.586]  Scientific global government.
[02:00:42.907 --> 02:00:44.148]  We're going to sterilize you.
[02:00:44.248 --> 02:00:45.409]  We're going to kill you.
[02:00:45.429 --> 02:00:47.430]  We're going to euthanize the old.
[02:00:48.351 --> 02:00:51.393]  And now they're making their move, pushing it out in the open.
[02:00:54.776 --> 02:01:02.562]  Okay, going back to Terrence in Detroit, I have an email here from the superintendent in this rural New York state school district.
[02:01:03.083 --> 02:01:04.043]  The Cressy family
[02:01:04.969 --> 02:01:07.790]  Law-abiding, kids being educated.
[02:01:07.810 --> 02:01:09.251]  There was a little civil matter.
[02:01:09.291 --> 02:01:14.353]  I've read the code of saying they're supposed to just register and let the school know that they're being instructed privately.
[02:01:14.894 --> 02:01:19.556]  Now, in the article Kurt Nemo wrote, we show where other states are trying to outright ban it now.
[02:01:19.896 --> 02:01:20.696]  Germany's done it.
[02:01:20.837 --> 02:01:21.617]  England's trying.
[02:01:22.097 --> 02:01:24.198]  It's the same global process in every country.
[02:01:24.218 --> 02:01:25.339]  It's globally managed.
[02:01:25.779 --> 02:01:26.539]  This is a fact.
[02:01:27.040 --> 02:01:27.820]  They brag about it.
[02:01:29.116 --> 02:01:31.237]  And so to make an example of them, they arrested him.
[02:01:31.277 --> 02:01:32.817]  The media said enough wasn't done.
[02:01:32.857 --> 02:01:35.218]  The CPS is talking about taking their children now.
[02:01:35.819 --> 02:01:37.779]  They didn't arrest him for not having him in school.
[02:01:37.819 --> 02:01:38.480]  They couldn't do that.
[02:01:39.180 --> 02:01:41.861]  In public school, they arrested him for child endangerment.
[02:01:43.061 --> 02:01:44.522]  That's in the news report.
[02:01:44.782 --> 02:01:48.543]  And these idiots comment on my website going, they deserve to be arrested.
[02:01:49.203 --> 02:01:51.384]  Boy, the government's going to abuse you and you're not going to like it.
[02:01:51.764 --> 02:01:52.925]  But I have his email here.
[02:01:55.649 --> 02:01:57.150]  And it says, thank you for your concern.
[02:01:57.190 --> 02:01:59.291]  This is Dr. James D. Hoffman.
[02:02:02.533 --> 02:02:06.536]  And he is in the article.
[02:02:10.680 --> 02:02:11.981]  Here, I guess we didn't give his number out.
[02:02:12.001 --> 02:02:14.222]  We gave out the Montgomery County Sheriff.
[02:02:15.543 --> 02:02:18.185]  We gave out the District Attorney, Child Protective Services, and the court.
[02:02:18.225 --> 02:02:22.008]  I guess we never gave out the phone number for the superintendent.
[02:02:22.388 --> 02:02:23.509]  I guess he's already getting calls.
[02:02:24.249 --> 02:02:26.471]  And it said, thank you for your concern.
[02:02:26.851 --> 02:02:27.731]  This is one of our listeners.
[02:02:28.092 --> 02:02:34.776]  It's unfortunate the situation had gained national notoriety and plunged both the family and the school district into such an unfamiliar spotlight.
[02:02:35.256 --> 02:02:36.958]  Neither deserve this level of security.
[02:02:37.278 --> 02:02:40.000]  No, you and the police need to know you're acting like a bunch of thugs.
[02:02:40.780 --> 02:02:42.061]  This is not Soviet Russia.
[02:02:42.982 --> 02:02:43.963]  It's Nazi Germany.
[02:02:44.063 --> 02:02:46.024]  Everywhere else they had government schooling.
[02:02:46.265 --> 02:02:47.405]  Homeschooling was banned.
[02:02:47.686 --> 02:02:48.967]  The government's trying to ban it.
[02:02:49.307 --> 02:02:50.188]  Don't you get it, buddy?
[02:02:51.269 --> 02:02:57.774]  I met with the parents on January 5th, reviewed their curriculum, and helped set them on the path to bring them into compliance with state law.
[02:02:58.054 --> 02:02:59.035]  This is after they were arrested.
[02:02:59.415 --> 02:03:03.679]  I expect this will soon be resolved quietly and amicably, away from public eyes.
[02:03:06.118 --> 02:03:06.498]  Okay?
[02:03:07.099 --> 02:03:13.523]  And then he goes on from there to say, oh, because one 18-year-old in our town couldn't read good after homeschooling, we have to do this.
[02:03:13.783 --> 02:03:25.831]  It's like France is in the news saying, we had 150 husbands and wives kill themselves last year, so we're banning yelling at each other to get husbands and wives tattling on each other to break up the family.
[02:03:27.172 --> 02:03:29.073]  And this is the government taking over the family.
[02:03:29.413 --> 02:03:31.174]  Oh, because 150 died out of 61,500,000 in France, all the French have to be slaves.
[02:03:36.650 --> 02:03:38.551]  This is guilty until proven innocent.
[02:03:38.591 --> 02:03:39.431]  This is slavery.
[02:03:39.952 --> 02:03:45.835]  Finish up with talking to Dr. James D. Hoffman, the superintendent of these Orwellian schools.
[02:03:46.195 --> 02:03:47.476]  What did he say to you on the phone?
[02:03:48.416 --> 02:03:55.340]  Well, I was with Mr. Conboy, and I said, won't you let the parents teach their children to read?
[02:03:55.360 --> 02:03:57.021]  And he said, well, they can't read.
[02:03:57.361 --> 02:03:58.261]  Okay, so I was wrong.
[02:03:58.281 --> 02:03:59.542]  You didn't talk to the superintendent.
[02:03:59.562 --> 02:04:03.224]  You talked to Conboy, that's his name, James Conboy, the district attorney.
[02:04:03.933 --> 02:04:04.253]  Correct.
[02:04:04.673 --> 02:04:06.073]  And he said, well, they can't read.
[02:04:06.154 --> 02:04:07.394]  And I said, did you test them?
[02:04:07.954 --> 02:04:15.896]  I said, why don't you pull 12, 18-year-old 12th graders out of a school district in your area, give them a paragraph and tell them to diagram it.
[02:04:16.176 --> 02:04:16.996]  They can't do it.
[02:04:17.096 --> 02:04:23.718]  You're graduating idiots, yet you want to force this family to put their kids in public schools so you can get government funds.
[02:04:23.778 --> 02:04:25.038]  That's the only reason you're doing this.
[02:04:25.058 --> 02:04:29.939]  You don't care about them, because if you did, you'd knock on their door and offer them a- And what did he say about you?
[02:04:31.847 --> 02:04:33.487]  He didn't say, he just wanted my name.
[02:04:33.507 --> 02:04:34.868]  I said, my name is irrelevant.
[02:04:34.968 --> 02:04:40.028]  I'm just a concerned citizen that wants to be free and wants you to set the Trissie family free.
[02:04:40.048 --> 02:04:40.929]  Let them be free.
[02:04:40.969 --> 02:04:41.569]  Leave them alone.
[02:04:43.369 --> 02:04:45.029]  And hopefully, hopefully he'll listen.
[02:04:45.069 --> 02:04:46.450]  Maybe it'll open his eyes a little bit.
[02:04:46.570 --> 02:04:49.390]  But at least I got through to him and he did give me five minutes.
[02:04:51.110 --> 02:04:52.091]  All right, good job.
[02:04:52.851 --> 02:04:54.311]  More calls straight ahead.
[02:04:54.371 --> 02:04:55.111]  Thank you, Terrence.
[02:04:55.591 --> 02:04:57.712]  Jason, Randy, others.
[02:04:58.052 --> 02:04:59.092]  First, I'm going to hit some news.
[02:04:59.132 --> 02:04:59.572]  Stay with us.
[02:05:02.642 --> 02:05:06.283]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:06.603 --> 02:05:14.725]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:05:15.465 --> 02:05:19.506]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:05:20.086 --> 02:05:30.908]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:05:31.528 --> 02:05:40.552]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:41.053 --> 02:05:46.095]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:05:46.475 --> 02:05:53.658]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:53.959 --> 02:05:56.700]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:06:02.216 --> 02:06:05.863]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:06:06.243 --> 02:06:09.249]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:06:09.489 --> 02:06:10.912]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:06:11.613 --> 02:06:14.274]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:06:14.294 --> 02:06:20.495]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:06:20.675 --> 02:06:26.197]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:06:26.217 --> 02:06:35.839]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:06:35.959 --> 02:06:38.061]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:06:38.321 --> 02:06:39.642]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:06:39.903 --> 02:06:42.185]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:06:42.365 --> 02:06:44.206]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:06:44.487 --> 02:06:49.231]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:06:49.631 --> 02:06:58.759]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:07:02.233 --> 02:07:04.495]  Our economy is in great distress.
[02:07:05.115 --> 02:07:07.997]  The financial dominoes can fall at any time.
[02:07:08.657 --> 02:07:13.360]  It's time to stop hoping it doesn't happen and prepare just in case it does.
[02:07:14.161 --> 02:07:15.962]  You have auto and home insurance.
[02:07:16.842 --> 02:07:18.904]  Why wouldn't you have food insurance?
[02:07:20.044 --> 02:07:25.228]  Are you prepared to feed your family long term because it might take years to recover?
[02:07:25.988 --> 02:07:31.652]  As the adult, it's your responsibility to feed your family, especially during rough times.
[02:07:32.526 --> 02:07:39.833]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is offering a package that will give you a 3-acre heirloom vegetable garden anywhere.
[02:07:39.853 --> 02:07:47.080]  50 heirloom varieties, 8,000 vegetable seeds, over 5 pounds of healthy food.
[02:07:47.960 --> 02:07:51.544]  Don't be fooled by marketing companies disguised as patriots.
[02:07:52.444 --> 02:07:58.270]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is owned by Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[02:08:02.117 --> 02:08:04.301]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.882 --> 02:08:07.687]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:32.040 --> 02:08:34.742]  There's a lot of pressure out there in the economy.
[02:08:35.943 --> 02:08:45.410]  And all the major studies show that when they adopted death education, teaching kids how to commit suicide in the name of not doing it, suicides exploded in the early 1990s.
[02:08:45.890 --> 02:08:51.234]  The more death education these globalist ghouls bring in, the more suicides we see.
[02:08:53.076 --> 02:08:55.037]  Over and over and over again.
[02:08:55.578 --> 02:08:58.260]  And as the media hypes mass shootings and hypes
[02:08:59.790 --> 02:09:13.079]  Death by cop suicide, getting the cops to shoot you, or death by mass shooting, where you go in and shoot a bunch of people and then kill yourself, the more people have that idea introduced to themselves.
[02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:18.043]  It's like so-called sex education to elementary students.
[02:09:18.883 --> 02:09:21.065]  Then they suddenly start experimenting sexually.
[02:09:21.385 --> 02:09:22.806]  They weren't even thinking about that.
[02:09:23.367 --> 02:09:26.269]  They're thinking about superheroes and football.
[02:09:27.109 --> 02:09:31.271]  And, you know, wrestling and TV shows.
[02:09:31.671 --> 02:09:35.032]  They're not thinking about sex, but they introduce it into their minds.
[02:09:35.072 --> 02:09:38.354]  And the social engineers, again, I've read their books, their own publications.
[02:09:38.954 --> 02:09:42.696]  They knew what they were doing, screwing up society and the family.
[02:09:43.176 --> 02:09:47.758]  They said, we've got to screw up society, break up the family, get people dependent, and move forward.
[02:09:49.045 --> 02:09:56.911]  And so when I see stories like this as the economy implodes, a hundred years ago people wouldn't go in a factory even if they got fired and shoot people up.
[02:09:57.571 --> 02:10:00.674]  But it's advertised as what people do.
[02:10:01.334 --> 02:10:02.995]  And so now it's in people's minds.
[02:10:03.176 --> 02:10:04.256]  The more they hype this.
[02:10:04.276 --> 02:10:12.743]  You know, if the media hyped for a year wearing green hats with a red feather, you'd see a hundred million people wearing green hats with red feathers.
[02:10:15.376 --> 02:10:20.378]  It's like if I get a puppy and I start bouncing a ball or doing catch with it, it's going to start doing catch.
[02:10:21.718 --> 02:10:23.659]  They are training the public to do this.
[02:10:24.459 --> 02:10:32.902]  An employee armed with an assault rifle and a handgun walked into a manufacturing plant Thursday morning and opened fire, killing at least three people and wounding five others, authorities said.
[02:10:33.502 --> 02:10:38.124]  Several hours later, police were still inside, Swiss-made ABB.
[02:10:38.144 --> 02:10:41.105]  Oh, they make nuclear reactors for the North Koreans.
[02:10:41.225 --> 02:10:44.606]  Donald Rumsfeld signed that deal off when Clinton was in.
[02:10:46.496 --> 02:10:49.338]  Going room to room in search of the gunman and additional victims.
[02:10:49.758 --> 02:10:50.738]  Took him hours to do that.
[02:10:51.219 --> 02:10:55.821]  Police Captain Sam Dotson said authorities had not confirmed whether the shooter was among the eight.
[02:11:00.724 --> 02:11:02.605]  He'd been an employee in the plant, they're saying.
[02:11:02.625 --> 02:11:03.986]  They believe the main suspect was.
[02:11:05.509 --> 02:11:12.134]  By the way, you've got the public schools saying they own your kids and you've got to basically keep them with them or register them with the schools.
[02:11:12.254 --> 02:11:16.176]  Once you start registering, then they go ahead and ban homeschooling outright.
[02:11:17.257 --> 02:11:21.900]  Registering and getting a license is an authorization to do something that would be illegal.
[02:11:23.582 --> 02:11:24.943]  Again, I want to remind you of the
[02:11:26.112 --> 02:11:29.154]  Associated Press.
[02:11:29.175 --> 02:11:30.636]  14 years after we exposed it.
[02:11:31.096 --> 02:11:35.820]  Texas has destroyed baby blood taken without consent in a secret DNA database.
[02:11:38.202 --> 02:11:47.289]  Underseen by the settlement by a San Antonio federal court, the blood samples collected without parental consent must be destroyed by early next year.
[02:11:47.449 --> 02:11:48.890]  It's all part of a UN database.
[02:11:49.210 --> 02:11:51.212]  They don't tell you all that though here in the article.
[02:11:52.413 --> 02:11:54.615]  That's just people suing in Minnesota and Texas.
[02:11:55.950 --> 02:11:56.510]  Here's another one.
[02:11:56.550 --> 02:11:58.011]  San Antonio Express News.
[02:11:58.472 --> 02:12:00.493]  State to destroy blood samples.
[02:12:01.633 --> 02:12:03.475]  I mean, do they have a right to take your blood?
[02:12:03.495 --> 02:12:06.076]  Do they have a right to naked body scan your family?
[02:12:06.556 --> 02:12:08.297]  No, they don't!
[02:12:08.698 --> 02:12:12.200]  And if you say no to them, they won't be able to get away with it anymore!
[02:12:18.669 --> 02:12:25.191]  Continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, CNN reports government uses stimulus money to buy the naked body scanners.
[02:12:25.631 --> 02:12:26.851]  That's what your stimulus is.
[02:12:28.832 --> 02:12:31.253]  Here's another propaganda report out of Fox News.
[02:12:31.273 --> 02:12:33.573]  Give me a close shot of this for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[02:12:33.973 --> 02:12:39.435]  Radio listeners Google, or StartPage.com the term, can cell phones cure Alzheimer's?
[02:12:42.042 --> 02:12:45.363]  And then it goes into rat studies saying it cured them of their Alzheimer's.
[02:12:45.423 --> 02:12:46.843]  Radiation is good for your brain.
[02:12:47.343 --> 02:12:58.667]  This is the same government that tells you mercury is now good for your brain and that melamine that the Chinese admit is killing people is good for you and 90% of milk in the United States.
[02:12:58.687 --> 02:13:03.608]  In fact, do we have that Chinese newscast in English about the melamine and the milk I sent you last night?
[02:13:06.189 --> 02:13:07.009]  Yeah, cue that up for me.
[02:13:07.029 --> 02:13:08.129]  I want to play that in a few minutes.
[02:13:08.610 --> 02:13:12.030]  Notice how they're, in the Asian news, still saying melamine's deadly.
[02:13:12.670 --> 02:13:14.491]  It killed a bunch of people last year, remember?
[02:13:14.931 --> 02:13:17.171]  Here they just say, no, melamine's not bad for you.
[02:13:17.451 --> 02:13:20.032]  Folks, they think you're the biggest idiots on earth.
[02:13:23.413 --> 02:13:24.593]  Look at this sickening story.
[02:13:24.653 --> 02:13:32.555]  London Guardian, and they report it like it's a good thing, but then every comment I read was, this is sick, this is Orwellian, this is eugenics, this is Brave New World.
[02:13:33.235 --> 02:13:34.295]  If you want to
[02:13:36.291 --> 02:13:44.672]  First it started with people with dementia, now they're saying anybody that wants to be in a nursing home has to have a feeding tube fitted before you get admitted with your government funding.
[02:13:45.653 --> 02:13:52.014]  So they can just plug you in, says you won't even have the pleasure of eating anymore, they just want to get rid of you and pump you full of morphine.
[02:13:52.854 --> 02:13:56.154]  Care homes forcing elderly to have feeding tubes fitted.
[02:13:57.095 --> 02:14:05.076]  Thousands of elderly people are being forced to have feeding tubes fitted so they can be artificially fed if they want to be admitted to a care home, a major report warns today.
[02:14:06.069 --> 02:14:18.119]  There's no evidence that feeding tube prolongs life and deprives patients of the pleasure of social contact involving normal eating and drinking, says Royal College Physicians Working Group, which recommends the artificial nutrition should only be used as a last resort.
[02:14:18.599 --> 02:14:18.799]  No.
[02:14:19.140 --> 02:14:21.742]  We're going to warehouse you and go ahead and get rid of you.
[02:14:23.732 --> 02:14:26.716]  Here's another sickening report, also out of The Guardian.
[02:14:27.357 --> 02:14:35.086]  Britain must launch GM food revolution, says chief scientist, to stop food shortages when the governments of England and the U.S.
[02:14:35.106 --> 02:14:36.548]  pay farmers not to grow crops.
[02:14:36.588 --> 02:14:37.329]  That's on record.
[02:14:37.349 --> 02:14:39.672]  It's saying climate change demands it.
[02:14:43.126 --> 02:14:45.387]  Saying the Earth's warming, there'll be less food.
[02:14:46.068 --> 02:14:53.211]  Every major study going back for thousands of years, everybody knows when the Earth warms up, you get higher yields of crops.
[02:14:54.492 --> 02:14:57.294]  Again, oh, if you're an environmentalist, you must be for GMO.
[02:14:57.334 --> 02:14:59.415]  See how they turn everything upside down?
[02:15:03.530 --> 02:15:15.815]  The government's releasing a report that's secret, so everybody gets it and goes over it, of how the airline bomber was able to get on and how they screwed up, but how they're going to give you more security and take all your rights, don't you worry.
[02:15:16.236 --> 02:15:20.377]  National Security Advisor, airline bomber, report to shock the public.
[02:15:20.397 --> 02:15:24.119]  You know, it's kind of like whenever they said that
[02:15:28.743 --> 02:15:30.204]  Oh, Katrina was a screw-up.
[02:15:30.604 --> 02:15:32.784]  We'll give FEMA even more power.
[02:15:33.885 --> 02:15:37.206]  Body scanners increase privacy, says corporate media.
[02:15:37.806 --> 02:15:40.567]  Paul Watson wrote an article for PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:15:42.608 --> 02:15:45.949]  And it goes over how wonderful it is and how it protects your privacy.
[02:15:46.369 --> 02:15:47.890]  Now you don't have to be strip-searched.
[02:15:47.930 --> 02:15:49.190]  The cameras just do it.
[02:15:51.151 --> 02:15:55.593]  See, imagine if they tried to videotape you while they strip-searched you.
[02:15:55.613 --> 02:15:56.353]  You would revolt.
[02:15:59.847 --> 02:16:05.610]  But because they do it and openly record it, and a camera does it, a scanner does it, then it's okay.
[02:16:06.190 --> 02:16:10.093]  Imagine if they recorded the strip searching physically, there'd be a revolt.
[02:16:10.613 --> 02:16:13.494]  But because they're recording it with a machine, it's okay.
[02:16:14.495 --> 02:16:19.598]  By the way, where's that comment by that well-known author that sent us the email about what he saw in TSA?
[02:16:19.618 --> 02:16:22.679]  Yeah, bring it in to me again.
[02:16:22.719 --> 02:16:23.560]  Thanks, I want to go over that.
[02:16:24.280 --> 02:16:25.121]  I had it yesterday.
[02:16:27.469 --> 02:16:27.989]  Here it is.
[02:16:28.750 --> 02:16:31.771]  This is a ticket that came into our email and he's got it up on his website.
[02:16:32.352 --> 02:16:34.873]  He said he was coming through Gatwick Airport, London, England.
[02:16:36.314 --> 02:16:41.816]  Comments to the TF say, I'm a New York Times bestselling ghostwriter and editor of many fiction and non-fiction books.
[02:16:42.697 --> 02:16:47.459]  I edited Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code, also a former Army Ranger, corporate mercenary, nine years, 211 overseas missions.
[02:16:49.401 --> 02:16:56.428]  One recent flight to Gatwick, I witnessed a beautiful blonde being ordered to submit to enter pat-down or full body scan.
[02:16:56.848 --> 02:16:59.471]  She was the only person in line who was subjected to the treatment.
[02:16:59.651 --> 02:17:01.172]  I have seen this with the pat-downs.
[02:17:01.853 --> 02:17:03.675]  Every perv in America goes to do this.
[02:17:03.875 --> 02:17:07.238]  They get the power, and they wave them out, and they just start squeezing.
[02:17:07.318 --> 02:17:08.039]  Everybody's seen it.
[02:17:09.460 --> 02:17:13.264]  And the women get real mad, and if they get mad, they taser you and beat you to death in some cases.
[02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:17.041]  And then say, oh, she killed herself in handcuffs.
[02:17:17.902 --> 02:17:19.603]  The handcuffs got around her neck and killed her.
[02:17:19.623 --> 02:17:20.003]  Remember that?
[02:17:23.265 --> 02:17:25.507]  She opted for scan instead of being felt up.
[02:17:26.027 --> 02:17:33.072]  I heard officers snickering when they crowded around the monitor of the woman's scan, revealing only what her husband should be privy to.
[02:17:33.712 --> 02:17:39.156]  I suppose, as the lady's husband, I could call my attorneys in Lauderdale and D.C.
[02:17:40.156 --> 02:17:44.359]  and file a complaint against TSA, but I've opted instead to write about it.
[02:17:46.616 --> 02:17:48.697]  Happy New Year, you abusive a-holes.
[02:17:49.197 --> 02:17:51.758]  Tell the TSA officers they're a bunch of scum.
[02:17:52.498 --> 02:18:00.241]  So, ladies and gentlemen, this is how your dog trained to be a slave.
[02:18:00.641 --> 02:18:05.703]  All you police officers, do you want your kids living in a country where they naked body scan them and grope women?
[02:18:06.843 --> 02:18:09.164]  Do you really believe all this bull you're told?
[02:18:10.236 --> 02:18:11.837]  Is this really what you want to be part of?
[02:18:12.177 --> 02:18:14.079]  I know most of the TSA people aren't perverts.
[02:18:14.159 --> 02:18:14.979]  You should say no.
[02:18:15.640 --> 02:18:16.960]  Your unions should say no.
[02:18:17.581 --> 02:18:27.387]  Several times, well, the last five or six times I've flown, the majority of the time, TSA in L.A., other cities, in Austin, Billings, Montana was nightmarish.
[02:18:27.427 --> 02:18:28.468]  It was like Nazi Germany.
[02:18:28.968 --> 02:18:31.150]  But other places, they go, Alex, I'm a fan.
[02:18:32.551 --> 02:18:33.912]  It happened in Newark.
[02:18:35.132 --> 02:18:36.473]  And listen, we're getting a union soon.
[02:18:36.493 --> 02:18:37.354]  We don't like what's going on.
[02:18:37.374 --> 02:18:38.034]  We know it's stupid.
[02:18:38.054 --> 02:18:38.675]  It's just a job.
[02:18:39.414 --> 02:18:40.214]  I'm a fan of your show!
[02:18:41.415 --> 02:18:42.275]  Over and over again.
[02:18:42.335 --> 02:18:43.976]  So I don't want to just say they're all scum.
[02:18:44.396 --> 02:18:50.338]  But I've seen the news with a good-looking woman in the scanner and they show the guy looking at the thing, seeing her naked image.
[02:18:50.698 --> 02:18:52.038]  The media doesn't point that out.
[02:18:53.319 --> 02:18:55.199]  But we know what they're looking at from the scans.
[02:18:55.639 --> 02:18:56.620]  And the guy's smiling.
[02:18:56.660 --> 02:19:04.382]  I mean, I would be so embarrassed to herd a good-looking woman in or anybody else and get off on looking at their naked body.
[02:19:04.422 --> 02:19:06.003]  I mean, this is perverted, man.
[02:19:08.795 --> 02:19:14.678]  I find it very unsexually stimulating to force things on people.
[02:19:14.958 --> 02:19:20.621]  The whole enjoyment, but I guess I'm normal, is people liking it.
[02:19:21.702 --> 02:19:26.484]  The giving, I don't want to get into it, isn't it normal you want the person to like it?
[02:19:27.544 --> 02:19:28.205]  Isn't it normal?
[02:19:28.265 --> 02:19:28.905]  That's 100% of the excitement?
[02:19:31.735 --> 02:19:36.118]  But no, a lot of sadistic people in history and police and others, they like raping people.
[02:19:36.558 --> 02:19:37.539]  They like abusing.
[02:19:37.579 --> 02:19:38.679]  They get off on it.
[02:19:39.180 --> 02:19:41.001]  Look at what every conquering army does.
[02:19:41.021 --> 02:19:42.702]  They rape every good-looking woman in the city.
[02:19:43.602 --> 02:19:45.363]  Our troops admittedly did it in World War II.
[02:19:49.126 --> 02:19:57.351]  I got a bunch of other news, but I'm gonna go ahead and get Aaron Dykes in here now to go ahead and start getting into George Bernard Shaw and others.
[02:19:57.951 --> 02:19:59.112]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:20:01.078 --> 02:20:03.380]  You have a mortgage and a load of other debt.
[02:20:03.501 --> 02:20:05.242]  Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?
[02:20:05.402 --> 02:20:07.184]  NoMoreMortgage can change your life.
[02:20:07.244 --> 02:20:08.586]  We paid off all of our bills.
[02:20:08.686 --> 02:20:11.449]  All your debt, including your mortgage, in as little as nine years?
[02:20:11.469 --> 02:20:17.054]  With NoMoreMortgage, we will have saved over $313,000 in interest payments.
[02:20:17.134 --> 02:20:18.716]  Even have more money left over each month?
[02:20:18.796 --> 02:20:21.379]  It lowered our monthly payments by a little over $500.
[02:20:21.419 --> 02:20:21.879]  NoMoreMortgage.
[02:20:23.901 --> 02:20:25.122]  Where have they been all of our life?
[02:20:25.182 --> 02:20:27.624]  If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody.
[02:20:27.684 --> 02:20:31.306]  Whenever I have a friend or someone that needs this service, I give them the number.
[02:20:31.566 --> 02:20:33.688]  I'm Larry Ruff, president of No More Mortgage.

[02:20:47.777 --> 02:20:48.518]  Call for your free CD now.
[02:20:48.538 --> 02:20:48.578]  800-578-6279.
[02:20:48.638 --> 02:20:49.018]  This works.
[02:20:49.038 --> 02:20:49.458]  Call the number.
[02:20:53.601 --> 02:20:59.665]  Call now for your free CD.
[02:20:59.685 --> 02:21:00.146]  800-578-6279.
[02:21:00.166 --> 02:21:00.486]  800-578-6279.
[02:21:01.046 --> 02:21:10.793]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[02:21:11.073 --> 02:21:15.116]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system.
[02:21:15.556 --> 02:21:17.117]  Wisdom being lost with time.
[02:21:17.498 --> 02:21:26.365]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[02:21:26.745 --> 02:21:35.652]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[02:21:35.933 --> 02:21:40.516]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[02:21:40.536 --> 02:21:42.078]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:42.338 --> 02:21:44.840]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[02:21:45.100 --> 02:21:46.001]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[02:21:46.141 --> 02:21:52.264]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[02:21:52.604 --> 02:21:53.224]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[02:21:53.244 --> 02:21:53.625]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[02:21:53.665 --> 02:21:56.446]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:21:56.466 --> 02:21:58.507]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:21:58.787 --> 02:21:59.788]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:22:11.716 --> 02:22:14.358]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:22:14.379 --> 02:22:20.584]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:22:20.764 --> 02:22:25.809]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:22:26.329 --> 02:22:35.958]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:22:36.058 --> 02:22:38.159]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:22:38.399 --> 02:22:39.740]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.281]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:22:42.461 --> 02:22:44.301]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:22:44.562 --> 02:22:49.384]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:22:49.724 --> 02:22:58.847]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:23:01.471 --> 02:23:04.075]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:23:04.495 --> 02:23:09.462]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:23:09.823 --> 02:23:11.565]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:23:11.866 --> 02:23:16.152]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only answer.
[02:23:18.047 --> 02:23:18.788]  When do you want it?
[02:23:19.169 --> 02:23:20.771]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:23:21.051 --> 02:23:21.872]  When will you need it?
[02:23:22.132 --> 02:23:24.195]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:23:24.335 --> 02:23:25.436]  Will there be any food?
[02:23:25.677 --> 02:23:26.998]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:23:27.199 --> 02:23:32.265]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:23:32.465 --> 02:23:34.548]  You wipe out all these problems if you have
[02:23:34.588 --> 02:23:34.848]  I think so.
[02:24:03.223 --> 02:24:05.924]  I think a parasitic dream will never come back.
[02:24:05.964 --> 02:24:09.364]  It painted my hands and my face blue.
[02:24:09.484 --> 02:24:15.366]  And suddenly, in the fast wind, it took me away.
[02:24:15.386 --> 02:24:21.147]  And made me fly in the infinite sky.
[02:24:21.167 --> 02:24:21.507]  Fly!
[02:24:21.787 --> 02:24:21.867]  Oh!
[02:24:36.875 --> 02:24:37.215]  I think?
[02:24:45.140 --> 02:24:46.861]  The left went to Hitler.
[02:24:47.022 --> 02:24:53.846]  At least in France, part of the socialists went to... to... became advocates of Hitler.
[02:24:53.927 --> 02:25:00.111]  The popular British playwright Bernard Shaw supported Hitler in the mass media.
[02:25:00.872 --> 02:25:04.014]  The left supported Hitler not because he deceived them.
[02:25:04.674 --> 02:25:06.376]  They knew Hitler would kill.
[02:25:06.936 --> 02:25:07.697]  He said he would.
[02:25:08.637 --> 02:25:12.260]  In fact, it was why they supported him.
[02:25:14.830 --> 02:25:20.774]  I know half a dozen people, at least, who are no use in this world, who are more trouble than they are worth.
[02:25:20.934 --> 02:25:27.118]  Just put them there and say, sir or madam, now will you be kind enough to justify your existence?
[02:25:28.459 --> 02:25:38.806]  If you can't justify your existence, if you're not pulling your weight in the social group, if you're not producing as much as you consume, or perhaps a little more, then
[02:25:39.815 --> 02:25:47.341]  Clearly, we cannot use the big organization of our society for the purpose of keeping you alive.
[02:25:47.521 --> 02:25:55.808]  Because, well, life does not benefit us, and it can't be of any much use to yourself.
[02:25:56.128 --> 02:25:59.411]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[02:25:59.611 --> 02:26:00.732]  Aaron Dice is in studio.
[02:26:00.752 --> 02:26:02.314]  Now, that's really bad audio.
[02:26:03.394 --> 02:26:05.616]  In fact, they gave me the documentary film this is from.
[02:26:05.636 --> 02:26:06.317]  Will you bring it in to me?
[02:26:06.337 --> 02:26:06.937]  Thanks, guys.
[02:26:07.338 --> 02:26:08.439]  There's so much going on here.
[02:26:09.897 --> 02:26:14.798]  And I really wanted to properly introduce this, so just what I'm going to do is I'm going to introduce this coming up in the next segment.
[02:26:15.518 --> 02:26:20.540]  Because I was doing a radio interview during the four-minute break, and then I wanted to pre-talk to you, Aaron, before we went with this.
[02:26:20.580 --> 02:26:21.600]  There's just so much happening.
[02:26:22.040 --> 02:26:29.762]  This is from the Soviet story, and we separately from Film Archives gotten this as well, a film by Mr. Snore.
[02:26:31.488 --> 02:26:41.872]  And Aaron has done deep research on this for the next film that we've got coming up, Fall of the Republic 2, that gets into the death plot, the New World Order takeover system.
[02:26:41.912 --> 02:26:50.976]  So what we're going to do is we're going to get into these different individuals coming up when we start the next segment.
[02:26:52.021 --> 02:26:57.008]  And the problem is there's so much evidence of these people's mass murders, so much evidence of their evil.
[02:26:57.448 --> 02:27:02.414]  We've got another clip that Aaron just ran in with right before we went live that is him praising Mussolini.
[02:27:03.433 --> 02:27:17.786]  And again, when you're watching this later at PrisonPlanet.tv or live, the audio is so low and old and bad, shot in the 20s and 30s, the different film clips of these different globalists, like George Bernard Shaw, that with the video you can see his lips moving and kind of make it out.
[02:27:18.286 --> 02:27:25.433]  Audio-wise, without the video, it's weird how bad audio, when you have the video as well, it like helps you almost lip-read what he's saying.
[02:27:25.773 --> 02:27:29.557]  But Shaw published books and articles where he said all this and more.
[02:27:30.137 --> 02:27:36.982]  And Aaron's got some of those quotes and documentation, but this is somebody who is praised by the left.
[02:27:37.762 --> 02:27:47.348]  And he praised Hitler, he praised Stalin, he praised Lenin, he praised Mussolini, he praised dictatorships, scientific dictatorships, scientific societies.
[02:27:47.689 --> 02:27:48.969]  That's coming up after the break.
[02:27:49.790 --> 02:27:51.871]  But right now, let's take a call.
[02:27:51.931 --> 02:27:53.032]  John, who's up next here?
[02:27:56.935 --> 02:27:58.596]  Jason in New Hampshire, you're on the air.
[02:28:00.879 --> 02:28:01.159]  Hello?
[02:28:01.639 --> 02:28:01.940]  Yes, sir.
[02:28:02.940 --> 02:28:09.204]  Hi, quick question and comment about these naked rape body scanners there.
[02:28:10.145 --> 02:28:16.109]  The image you guys posted of the woman with the gun, is that the standard photo that these scanners produce?
[02:28:16.649 --> 02:28:16.909]  Yes.
[02:28:17.410 --> 02:28:18.730]  In fact, it's more detailed.
[02:28:18.810 --> 02:28:25.775]  It's super high res, you can blow them up right down to her pores, and then the news always shows you a blurred one.
[02:28:26.829 --> 02:28:27.430]  Right, right.
[02:28:28.390 --> 02:28:35.395]  With that image, all you really have to do is reverse the negative and you have a full color, regular image of the person.
[02:28:36.396 --> 02:28:37.377]  That's the standard.
[02:28:37.397 --> 02:28:38.298]  That's what we're looking at.
[02:28:38.318 --> 02:28:40.519]  You know, that's a good idea.
[02:28:40.559 --> 02:28:43.722]  We need to reverse the negative on her and show people.
[02:28:43.962 --> 02:28:48.005]  But I mean, it's already, you can see every detail of her breast, every detail of her.
[02:28:48.725 --> 02:28:50.266]  And I mean, this is outrageous.
[02:28:50.306 --> 02:28:55.490]  I mean, I'm not a shy person, but I am shy about a bunch of goons looking at my genitals.
[02:28:56.531 --> 02:28:59.892]  If they can do this, but that's what George Bertrand Shaw wanted.
[02:29:00.172 --> 02:29:03.673]  Same-sex toilets and everything is to break down our species.
[02:29:04.053 --> 02:29:05.293]  Get rid of who we are.
[02:29:05.613 --> 02:29:11.955]  And now look at how they're putting in same-sex bathrooms in the military, at colleges, and they all say why they're doing it.
[02:29:12.195 --> 02:29:15.796]  It's not just us saying they're breaking up the family and the human order.
[02:29:16.156 --> 02:29:16.796]  They say it!
[02:29:17.976 --> 02:29:18.556]  Absolutely.
[02:29:19.636 --> 02:29:21.177]  Also, if your listeners
[02:29:22.176 --> 02:29:26.840]  You can check out a couple of studies online about how terahertz waves can tear apart the DNA.
[02:29:27.400 --> 02:29:33.285]  We've posted major medical studies, mainline scientific publications saying this is deadly.
[02:29:33.585 --> 02:29:35.207]  And it's the body load of this.
[02:29:35.827 --> 02:29:40.511]  And these technicians running these machines, they're gonna all wonder why their testicles rot off.
[02:29:41.011 --> 02:29:43.794]  Because those are outside the body and will pick up the most radiation.
[02:29:44.094 --> 02:29:45.675]  But they like testicular cancer.
[02:29:45.815 --> 02:29:47.777]  So, it's what they want, it's what they get.
[02:29:51.269 --> 02:29:54.257]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.200 --> 02:29:57.887]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.065 --> 02:30:05.707]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:30:05.727 --> 02:30:09.088]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:30:09.328 --> 02:30:14.110]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:30:14.130 --> 02:30:20.353]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:30:20.513 --> 02:30:22.754]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:30:23.294 --> 02:30:23.574]  Tim Geithner?
[02:30:23.594 --> 02:30:24.015]  Bernanke?
[02:30:24.095 --> 02:30:24.875]  They're arsonists!
[02:30:24.895 --> 02:30:26.036]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:30:26.056 --> 02:30:28.297]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:30:42.185 --> 02:30:44.587]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:30:44.607 --> 02:30:47.108]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:30:47.128 --> 02:30:48.669]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:31:11.798 --> 02:31:14.459]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:31:14.479 --> 02:31:20.661]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:31:20.861 --> 02:31:25.883]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:31:26.403 --> 02:31:36.027]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:31:36.167 --> 02:31:38.269]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:31:38.509 --> 02:31:39.830]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:31:40.090 --> 02:31:42.372]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:31:42.552 --> 02:31:44.393]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:31:44.673 --> 02:31:49.417]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:31:49.817 --> 02:31:54.621]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[02:33:01.553 --> 02:33:02.380]  I don't know.
[02:33:13.576 --> 02:33:21.339]  Aaron Dykes has conservatively bought through this office and read over 50 books by eugenicists and books about eugenicists.
[02:33:21.900 --> 02:33:26.162]  This is the dominant culture in the Western world for over a hundred years.
[02:33:26.822 --> 02:33:40.848]  And that's why when you're in newsstands, you see articles about the people bomb and falling fertility and how the West is dying and how we're suddenly, you know, sterile and sperm counts dropping and how wonderful it is, like in this economist this month,
[02:33:42.021 --> 02:33:47.587]  It says, uh, falling fertility, how the population problem is solving itself.
[02:33:47.947 --> 02:33:51.751]  Fertility is falling astonishingly fast and that's bringing big benefits.
[02:33:52.451 --> 02:33:54.013]  Page 15.
[02:33:55.094 --> 02:33:59.378]  And then I turn to page 15 and I can read all about it.
[02:33:59.739 --> 02:34:01.520]  So you see their propaganda everywhere.
[02:34:01.881 --> 02:34:05.044]  Oh, the UN just said a month ago in Copenhagen.
[02:34:05.933 --> 02:34:06.594]  Copenhagen.
[02:34:07.034 --> 02:34:13.961]  They said, we want a world tax on children and a tax on every can of tomato sauce you buy.
[02:34:14.061 --> 02:34:15.782]  Everything with its energy ration.
[02:34:16.403 --> 02:34:19.506]  To shut off human activity to save the planet.
[02:34:19.866 --> 02:34:24.711]  Which is just as fraudulent as their man-made global warming, with record cold temperatures gripping the planet right now.
[02:34:25.091 --> 02:34:35.695]  You read Ecoscience by the White House Science Czar, and the previous science advisor to George Bush Sr., Paul O'Erlich, the current John P. Holdren for Obama, the same crew.
[02:34:36.095 --> 02:34:42.738]  Literally hundreds and hundreds of books they've read, more than 50 the last few years since we made Endgame that Aaron's been obsessed with reading.
[02:34:43.858 --> 02:34:46.239]  We're putting that knowledge into the new film we're working on.
[02:34:46.959 --> 02:34:51.801]  All of this going on, books by Bernard Shaw, George Bernard Shaw.
[02:34:53.038 --> 02:34:55.881]  Where he endlessly said, we'll set up a world dictatorship.
[02:34:56.662 --> 02:34:59.325]  Anyone with below a 90 IQ will be executed.
[02:34:59.345 --> 02:35:02.329]  We need a painless gas so it's humane.
[02:35:02.389 --> 02:35:03.490]  Killing you is humane.
[02:35:03.530 --> 02:35:04.251]  He says it's humane.
[02:35:06.094 --> 02:35:08.235]  He went and met with Hitler, Mussolini.
[02:35:08.355 --> 02:35:09.336]  He loved them.
[02:35:09.436 --> 02:35:10.337]  They were great.
[02:35:10.477 --> 02:35:11.417]  They were good.
[02:35:11.497 --> 02:35:12.718]  They were wonderful.
[02:35:13.558 --> 02:35:22.343]  And then after Hitler got exposed, that's why my dad, the botany professor at UT, was like, I'm Jewish and Hitler only wanted to kill certain groups.
[02:35:22.823 --> 02:35:25.685]  The truth is we have to reduce world population of all the bad people.
[02:35:25.785 --> 02:35:26.706]  Eugenics is good.
[02:35:27.626 --> 02:35:29.929]  See, and that's what I was taught in college.
[02:35:29.969 --> 02:35:33.292]  It was just, oh, you're here for a history class.
[02:35:33.312 --> 02:35:34.293]  There's too many people.
[02:35:34.594 --> 02:35:35.334]  Whites are bad.
[02:35:35.374 --> 02:35:36.275]  And be a white professor.
[02:35:37.557 --> 02:35:38.598]  And I was like, what is this?
[02:35:39.138 --> 02:35:40.139]  World government's good?
[02:35:40.179 --> 02:35:45.805]  Then I'd go turn CNN on and say, the Southern Poverty Law Center says there's dangerous people saying there's a world government.
[02:35:46.506 --> 02:35:46.886]  And I went.
[02:35:47.627 --> 02:35:49.129]  In college, 20 years old, 19 years old, I went.
[02:35:51.135 --> 02:36:04.738]  Wait a minute, they're telling me my guns are bad, white people are bad, world government's good, we need to reduce world population, but I turned CNN on, or I turned C-SPAN on, they're having congressional hearings about dangerous crazies that believe the government's doing this.
[02:36:05.938 --> 02:36:10.939]  So see, they propagandize, but then demonize so that mainline Americans never get involved.
[02:36:10.999 --> 02:36:15.280]  It's a thing of not making it kosher or palatable to talk about this.
[02:36:16.800 --> 02:36:20.621]  Now, I just happened across a video clip on YouTube last night.
[02:36:22.086 --> 02:36:29.292]  And I had already seen it here in the office in our research from the Soviet story, which is a powerful film.
[02:36:29.352 --> 02:36:35.697]  It won the Boston Film Festival, the Black Knights Film Festival, the Baltic Film Festival, the Sedona Film Festival.
[02:36:36.697 --> 02:36:37.458]  Pretty big film.
[02:36:39.199 --> 02:36:48.767]  And it's the Soviet story, and it completely exposes how the Soviets and the Nazis were the same, worked for the same people, all run by leftist eugenicists.
[02:36:49.687 --> 02:36:50.828]  Who worshipped Hitler.
[02:36:50.868 --> 02:36:54.692]  I mean, I have to see Margaret Sanger all the time in Newsweek and Time as a wonderful woman.
[02:36:54.912 --> 02:36:56.273]  She was Time Magazine of the Year.
[02:36:56.533 --> 02:36:59.656]  She was the 100 most important women in the last century, in 2000.
[02:37:00.176 --> 02:37:06.002]  And they never tell you, she said, blacks are subhuman weeds that must be killed.
[02:37:06.322 --> 02:37:09.625]  We'll use the Rockefeller Foundation to hire black leaders to do it.
[02:37:10.966 --> 02:37:11.407]  W.D.B.
[02:37:11.427 --> 02:37:12.427]  Du Bois, all of them.
[02:37:12.447 --> 02:37:12.828]  Or E.B.
[02:37:12.848 --> 02:37:13.749]  Du Bois, all of them.
[02:37:14.730 --> 02:37:16.911]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[02:37:16.931 --> 02:37:32.134]  We've got three clips, some of it's really bad audio, because it was filmed, you know, 80 years ago, or more, with him worshipping Mussolini, the worshipping of Hitler, the quotes that we've got out of his book about nerve-gassing you.
[02:37:33.535 --> 02:37:37.796]  Now, this, when you read the Wikipedia about him, this is the great liberal
[02:37:39.606 --> 02:37:43.689]  He's worshipped as one of the greatest liberals ever.
[02:37:44.129 --> 02:37:59.841]  Just two weeks ago, we had the video clip of MSNBC of one of the supporters of George Bernard Shaw, who promotes FEMA camps and mass arrests and Soviet re-education, and he's called the communist communist.
[02:38:00.982 --> 02:38:05.006]  And he's Saul Alinsky, who pledged his book to Lucifer, the original radical.
[02:38:05.986 --> 02:38:07.427]  He was a big supporter of Shaw.
[02:38:08.536 --> 02:38:14.380]  And here is Chris Matthews saying this is his idol.
[02:38:15.240 --> 02:38:23.485]  But then Chris Matthews, if he was sitting here before me, I guarantee you would laugh at me if I talked about communism.
[02:38:23.785 --> 02:38:24.766]  But see, he really knows.
[02:38:24.806 --> 02:38:25.326]  It's a joke.
[02:38:25.426 --> 02:38:27.127]  He... It's like I'm a child.
[02:38:27.167 --> 02:38:28.048]  He goes, that's off limits.
[02:38:28.068 --> 02:38:28.728]  That doesn't exist.
[02:38:29.028 --> 02:38:31.050]  Yes, I praise communist leaders, but it doesn't exist.
[02:38:31.977 --> 02:38:34.879]  Yes, there's a world government, but you are so stupid you're not even allowed to resist it.
[02:38:35.339 --> 02:38:43.504]  So, we've got a lot of his quotes, got some video clips coming up, Aaron, but from your research of these people, what is the guiding principle of the left and right?
[02:38:43.844 --> 02:38:45.785]  What is their real secret religion?
[02:38:45.805 --> 02:38:48.246]  Not even really secret, they all publish it, but I think we're so dumb we don't read it.
[02:38:49.067 --> 02:38:51.088]  And who is George Bernard Shaw?
[02:38:51.468 --> 02:38:54.809]  George Bernard Shaw believes in eugenics as a religion.
[02:38:55.169 --> 02:38:58.810]  There's a quote with those words, just as Francis Galton said the same thing.
[02:38:59.350 --> 02:39:10.232]  And the shocking thing for me, that I didn't know before I started working here, was that all the stuff the Nazis did was from, you know, England and the United States through all these eugenicists before that.
[02:39:10.792 --> 02:39:14.873]  And it just fits right in with the whole socialism and collectivism thing.
[02:39:15.453 --> 02:39:19.774]  They want to control everything from birth to everything you're allowed to eat and have.
[02:39:20.154 --> 02:39:21.755]  They want to control all of society.
[02:39:21.775 --> 02:39:25.796]  This is a religion of chicken-necked pervert control freaks.
[02:39:26.056 --> 02:39:31.278]  They're always perverts, they're always control freaks, and all they talk about is killing people.
[02:39:31.678 --> 02:39:38.285]  But Bernard Shaw, personally, when he was growing up, identified with Mephistopheles from Faust, which is the devil character.
[02:39:38.786 --> 02:39:41.589]  He believed he looked like him, and he praised Nietzsche.
[02:39:41.609 --> 02:39:43.831]  He was obsessed with Nietzsche's Superman costume.
[02:39:43.871 --> 02:39:47.395]  And he liked Lenin, and Lenin thought he was the devil and tried to do his beard like the devil.
[02:39:47.555 --> 02:39:48.856]  Yeah, so it's... I mean, they're devils!
[02:39:48.896 --> 02:39:51.219]  They're psychopaths that get your government and kill you!
[02:39:51.559 --> 02:39:58.362]  And they believe in every form and fashion that they're the elite class and that the rest of us are expendable and should be eliminated.
[02:39:58.562 --> 02:40:02.464]  But really, we're just not psychopath control freaks craving power like them.
[02:40:02.984 --> 02:40:04.125]  Oh yeah, they want the power back.
[02:40:04.865 --> 02:40:06.546]  I mean, these people are terrible.
[02:40:06.626 --> 02:40:19.872]  But see, that's the point I made in an earlier hour, is that if you look at the Aztecs, if you look at the Mayans, if you look at the Germanic and Druidic tribes of Europe, if you look at the Romans, if you look at the Greeks, that's not popularly taught, but many Greek tribes had human sacrifice.
[02:40:20.712 --> 02:40:27.778]  If you look at the Babylonians, the Egyptians, every culture, the ancient Chinese, they all had human sacrifice.
[02:40:28.178 --> 02:40:30.720]  And the priest class would demand the best looking maiden.
[02:40:30.740 --> 02:40:33.903]  A lot of times they would demand the prince or even the king.
[02:40:33.923 --> 02:40:38.647]  And they would use a drought or a crisis to say, see, give me more power.
[02:40:38.987 --> 02:40:40.548]  In fact, we see the worst periods
[02:40:41.534 --> 02:40:47.823]  In all these different societies, going back over 8,000 years, when there's bad droughts or floods.
[02:40:48.164 --> 02:40:53.271]  Because the priest class can then scare everybody and say, the volcano god is mad.
[02:40:53.331 --> 02:40:54.874]  Look at the Polynesians.
[02:40:54.954 --> 02:40:55.855]  Look at the Hawaiians.
[02:40:56.826 --> 02:41:01.407]  Throwing one of the daughters of the king into Pele.
[02:41:02.208 --> 02:41:05.509]  Again, it's a primitive 1% of the population, conservatively.
[02:41:05.569 --> 02:41:07.829]  Sociologists and psychologists have studied it.
[02:41:08.950 --> 02:41:10.770]  On average, 1% are psychopaths.
[02:41:11.150 --> 02:41:13.491]  And they don't just not have feelings, they're sadistic psychopaths.
[02:41:13.511 --> 02:41:14.451]  They enjoy pain.
[02:41:15.132 --> 02:41:19.073]  And through thousands of years, they are always going to end up getting in control.
[02:41:19.994 --> 02:41:21.756]  You may have some good governments, but they're rare.
[02:41:22.036 --> 02:41:25.000]  And once they get into control, they go hog-wild mad.
[02:41:25.660 --> 02:41:28.443]  And again, they always demand children.
[02:41:28.744 --> 02:41:30.245]  They like to torture innocent children.
[02:41:30.265 --> 02:41:31.106]  That's the funnest thing.
[02:41:31.427 --> 02:41:39.976]  And they've got to give them to Quetzalcoatl, they've got to give them to Chocmul, they've got to give them to Samhain, they've got to give them to...
[02:41:42.259 --> 02:41:42.839]  More Duke.
[02:41:42.939 --> 02:41:45.282]  They've got to give it to Astaroth.
[02:41:45.322 --> 02:41:47.124]  They've got to give it to Beelzebub.
[02:41:47.484 --> 02:41:48.966]  They've got to give it to Horus.
[02:41:49.426 --> 02:41:51.529]  They've got to give it to Moloch.
[02:41:51.929 --> 02:41:54.311]  They've got to give... I mean, and again, I want to explain this.
[02:41:55.613 --> 02:41:58.256]  The reason these different... and the globalists divide and conquer.
[02:41:58.516 --> 02:41:59.937]  The reason they obsess
[02:42:01.707 --> 02:42:12.718]  In Divide and Conquer on always having a myth of only the Catholics are evil, or only the Jews are evil, and all evil flows, or only white man is evil, or only black men are evil.
[02:42:13.498 --> 02:42:19.204]  They've got the mark of Cain on them, and so they deserve to be slaves.
[02:42:19.384 --> 02:42:22.567]  500 years ago with the start of the transatlantic slave trade into the Americas.
[02:42:23.849 --> 02:42:26.131]  It's always an excuse to dehumanize a group
[02:42:27.586 --> 02:42:31.751]  And so then people can't recognize the evil of their own organization.
[02:42:32.192 --> 02:42:34.274]  Because it's only that outside group that's evil.
[02:42:34.554 --> 02:42:37.178]  The Jews, they say, are inherently the seed of the devil.
[02:42:37.458 --> 02:42:39.260]  The blacks are inherently the seed of the devil.
[02:42:39.500 --> 02:42:46.268]  The white man is inherently the... Every group, the black groups, the royal Israelite groups, they believe the whites and Jews are the devil.
[02:42:46.829 --> 02:42:48.811]  And then the other groups believe the blacks are the devil.
[02:42:49.231 --> 02:42:57.078]  And then, and of course, you've got psychopaths that are Jewish groups, that are feeding on their own people, getting them to go under their control through the outside threat.
[02:42:57.098 --> 02:43:02.262]  We have the Zionist documents where they like their people to get persecuted, they have to, they finance groups to do it.
[02:43:02.543 --> 02:43:08.408]  To bomb Jewish, this is declassified by the British and the Jews in Israel, that they would bomb
[02:43:09.088 --> 02:43:18.034]  The ancient Jewish communities in Iran, and the ancient communities in Syria, and the ancient communities in Spain, and the ancient communities in Iraq, to make them go to Israel.
[02:43:18.274 --> 02:43:24.998]  They would pay Hitler to not let the Jews leave anywhere but to Israel, and then to pay the Zionist money to get out.
[02:43:25.258 --> 02:43:28.200]  There have been major university publications written by Jews about that.
[02:43:29.195 --> 02:43:30.216]  That's a microcosm.
[02:43:30.236 --> 02:43:41.024]  The obsession on Jews is that by only saying Jews or one other group, but that's a good example, are evil, then you can't recognize the inherent psychopaths in your own group.
[02:43:41.345 --> 02:43:49.631]  It allows the elites to divide and conquer, but it also allows the psycho groups over the Catholics, over the Jews, over the Protestants, over the military.
[02:43:49.852 --> 02:43:50.572]  It's all cults.
[02:43:50.692 --> 02:43:57.598]  Brainwashing, marching, sleep deprivation, shaved heads, identity, flags, colors, groups, gangs, cults.
[02:43:58.118 --> 02:44:04.426]  Everything is ancient mind control, and that's why they order you must body scan as an act of supplication, of submission.
[02:44:04.466 --> 02:44:05.588]  You must take your shoes off.
[02:44:05.808 --> 02:44:06.990]  You must answer questions.
[02:44:07.250 --> 02:44:08.552]  It's all about submission.
[02:44:09.393 --> 02:44:13.318]  And, so again, you have psychopaths of all these major groups.
[02:44:14.264 --> 02:44:20.408]  Instead of just saying, oh, the leadership of Germany, or the leadership of China, or the leadership of Israel, or the leadership of Iran is evil.
[02:44:20.508 --> 02:44:22.450]  No, that group becomes evil.
[02:44:22.690 --> 02:44:24.251]  Then we never recognize the truth.
[02:44:24.351 --> 02:44:33.737]  It is a 1% psychopath guild that have developed systems of con artistry and manipulation to build a planet where they can carry out their operations.
[02:44:34.038 --> 02:44:34.478]  Aaron Dykes.
[02:44:36.055 --> 02:44:46.421]  The racism is that the only group they really respect is their own aristocracy, but really only the ones who are willing to take control and, you know, quote, do what must be done for, quote, the Constitution.
[02:44:46.441 --> 02:44:48.282]  Do what must be done, Lord Vader.
[02:44:48.362 --> 02:44:49.342]  Kill the younglings.
[02:44:49.682 --> 02:44:52.004]  You must kill the innocents to prove you're a psycho.
[02:44:52.744 --> 02:44:58.087]  And the priest class always demands children and women be killed as an act of total submission.
[02:44:59.502 --> 02:45:07.491]  Yeah, and they want to eliminate the race so the Superman race can rise, but really they all have fatal flaws and they're evil, wicked people.
[02:45:07.591 --> 02:45:15.579]  All of these elitists, who don't end up getting killed or executed, die, I don't even want to say how they all end up, eating their own
[02:45:16.380 --> 02:45:18.682]  Excrement, crazy, thinking they're God.
[02:45:18.702 --> 02:45:23.766]  It's admitted that Lennon would go to a little island he had with thousands of white rabbits.
[02:45:23.786 --> 02:45:30.311]  They ended up putting that in a Hollywood movie, separately, where the crazy guy pops the back of the car and throws out the rabbits and is running around shooting them with a shotgun.
[02:45:30.552 --> 02:45:34.375]  And he would just run around stabbing them and killing them and shooting them and just flopping around.
[02:45:34.655 --> 02:45:36.817]  He would order them more blood, more death.
[02:45:36.977 --> 02:45:38.218]  We have that in a clip coming up.
[02:45:38.803 --> 02:45:46.287]  Yeah, I think Franco in Spain liked to hunt an entire field of quail and he wasn't satisfied until there were thousands of them.
[02:45:46.587 --> 02:45:48.408]  He didn't even like to eat them, he just liked to kill.
[02:45:48.768 --> 02:45:49.969]  He would have others help him kill.
[02:45:50.649 --> 02:45:53.051]  I guess it's something they do, I don't know.
[02:45:54.211 --> 02:46:01.677]  I get in here and start ranting, I want to give people all the data, but think about every human culture turns into human sacrifice, enslavement and war.
[02:46:02.298 --> 02:46:11.144]  It's an act of utter submission, because psychopaths like the same thing, whether it's Ted Bundy or whether it was, you know, the king of the Aztecs, Montezuma.
[02:46:11.765 --> 02:46:12.846]  It's the same deal.
[02:46:13.986 --> 02:46:15.828]  Let's play this Mussolini worshipping clip.
[02:46:16.088 --> 02:46:20.552]  Here he is worshipping Mussolini, the head liberal that they all worship, George Bernard Shaw.
[02:46:21.314 --> 02:46:30.957]  The other thing I, uh, for instance... Now that is, uh, that is what I call my Mussolini study.
[02:46:32.078 --> 02:46:42.401]  They, uh, by the way, I think in justice to Signor Mussolini, I ought to tell you that he has a very wonderful head.
[02:46:43.222 --> 02:46:46.543]  He has a wonderful brow, which comes down to here.
[02:46:47.779 --> 02:46:51.141]  But the difficulty is that he can't take it off.
[02:46:52.402 --> 02:47:01.448]  Now, if you watch me, I can put on that imposing look that terrifies you, the Mussolini look.
[02:47:05.630 --> 02:47:06.671]  Then he howls at work.
[02:47:07.471 --> 02:47:08.712]  Then he does the fascist salute.
[02:47:09.393 --> 02:47:10.413]  I can take it off.
[02:47:11.434 --> 02:47:14.116]  Now, Signor Mussolini cannot take it off.
[02:47:14.997 --> 02:47:28.803]  He is condemned, although he is a most amiable man, he is condemned to go through life with that terrible and imposing expression that really does a great deal of injustice to his kindly nature.
[02:47:29.443 --> 02:47:33.005]  But I, I can put it on, and I can take it off.
[02:47:33.045 --> 02:47:42.949]  And he goes on to say how great Mussolini is, and in his writings he praised Hitler, he praised Mussolini, and he believed, we're going to play that clip coming up, that everyone should be nerve gassed.
[02:47:42.970 --> 02:47:43.850]  Go ahead and read some quotes.
[02:47:44.170 --> 02:47:48.492]  Yeah, it's kind of, there's a riddle in there, because he calls Mussolini kindly and amiable.
[02:47:48.873 --> 02:47:49.933]  It's in his quotes, too.
[02:47:50.393 --> 02:47:58.958]  If, under socialism, you would not be allowed to be poor, you would be forcibly fed, clothed, lodged, taught, and employed, whether you like it or not.
[02:47:59.378 --> 02:48:07.703]  And if it were discovered that you had not the character and industry enough to be worth all this trouble, you might be possibly executed in a kindly manner.
[02:48:08.103 --> 02:48:12.546]  And see, once you're in a socialist system, oh, we've got to kill people because they're not pulling their weight.
[02:48:13.426 --> 02:48:15.427]  And he calls for the humane gas.
[02:48:15.907 --> 02:48:21.129]  It's a death that's instant and painless, but it's death nonetheless.
[02:48:21.710 --> 02:48:23.991]  That's the nature of the quotes that he puts forward.
[02:48:24.291 --> 02:48:25.151]  And you find H.G.
[02:48:25.171 --> 02:48:26.552]  Wells says the same kind of thing.
[02:48:27.292 --> 02:48:31.714]  And that's what they did in Nazi Germany and under communism.
[02:48:31.874 --> 02:48:33.915]  Let's go to the next clip in Fluoride in the Water.
[02:48:34.115 --> 02:48:34.996]  The Soviets started that.
[02:48:35.016 --> 02:48:35.856]  Let's go to the next clip.
[02:48:35.876 --> 02:48:36.997]  The first part's in German.
[02:48:37.377 --> 02:48:42.019]  Then it's Shaw talking how great about eugenics and control is.
[02:48:42.079 --> 02:48:43.540]  In fact, Aaron, tell us about this clip coming up.
[02:48:45.621 --> 02:48:46.941]  Yeah, it's the same kind of thing.
[02:48:47.001 --> 02:48:51.383]  It's how he wants to forcibly execute people who are not deemed worthwhile to live.
[02:48:51.764 --> 02:48:53.525]  It is eugenics, but it's also socialism.
[02:48:53.545 --> 02:48:55.966]  And now the cover of Newsweek, the case for killing Granny.
[02:48:56.006 --> 02:48:56.326]  Here it is.
[02:49:02.799 --> 02:49:04.061]  Why killing is essential.
[02:49:05.362 --> 02:49:07.505]  First appeared in January 1849 in...
[02:49:09.890 --> 02:49:34.689]  In Marx's journal Neue Rheinische Zeitung, Engels wrote of how the class war in Marxian terms means that when socialist revolution happens, the class war happens, there will be primitive societies in Europe two stages behind because they're not even capitalist yet.
[02:49:35.569 --> 02:50:01.187]  And he had in mind the Basques, and the Bretons, and the Scottish Highlanders, and the Serbs, and, uh, he calls them racial trash, uh, folk who are up-fedder, racial trash, and they will have to be destroyed because being two stages behind in historical struggle, it will be impossible to bring them up.
[02:50:01.207 --> 02:50:01.468]  It was.
[02:50:02.665 --> 02:50:10.709]  See, Marx and Engels both wrote, and this would be in British newspapers, we're going to kill the Scots, we're going to kill the Serbs, and notice who they attack, the Serbs.
[02:50:11.349 --> 02:50:17.832]  Anyone who wants to be rural and just a regular human, you must be killed because you can't be part of the scientific dictatorship.
[02:50:18.072 --> 02:50:21.374]  And then Russell comes up, they cut back to a clip of him saying, do that.
[02:50:23.535 --> 02:50:24.475]  I couldn't agree more.
[02:50:24.735 --> 02:50:25.516]  It's very shocking.
[02:50:25.556 --> 02:50:28.497]  Bertrand Russell said the same stuff, George Bernard Shaw, all of them.
[02:50:28.891 --> 02:50:40.399]  See, the thing with British Fabian Socialism is they believe specifically in the long-term incremental socialism and to hide the true nature of socialism from the people who believed it was for the common good.
[02:50:40.419 --> 02:50:44.862]  And you see other founders like, um, uh, Webb, the Webb...
[02:50:45.945 --> 02:50:46.566]  Uh, parents.
[02:50:47.026 --> 02:50:52.850]  They went to Russia and came back, it was said, as the Ten Commandments they had in their hands.
[02:50:53.210 --> 02:50:56.392]  They loved what was being done over there, they just knew they couldn't do it as quickly.
[02:50:56.892 --> 02:51:01.796]  They want to line you up and kill you and then take your daughters and sons and rape them as they slit their throats.
[02:51:01.816 --> 02:51:02.536]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:51:02.576 --> 02:51:07.920]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:51:08.160 --> 02:51:09.741]  Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[02:51:09.981 --> 02:51:12.787]  Non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold.
[02:51:13.168 --> 02:51:13.569]  It's true.
[02:51:13.649 --> 02:51:16.235]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[02:51:16.475 --> 02:51:18.199]  And it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:51:18.746 --> 02:51:23.448]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:51:23.968 --> 02:51:25.889]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:51:26.289 --> 02:51:30.891]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:51:31.091 --> 02:51:31.972]  And here's the best part.
[02:51:32.212 --> 02:51:34.973]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:51:35.273 --> 02:51:38.595]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:51:38.895 --> 02:51:41.736]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:51:42.076 --> 02:51:43.977]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:51:44.297 --> 02:51:45.218]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:51:48.871 --> 02:51:52.575]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:51:53.095 --> 02:51:57.620]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:51:57.940 --> 02:52:00.383]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:52:02.345 --> 02:52:05.989]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:06.349 --> 02:52:09.372]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:09.612 --> 02:52:11.014]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:52:11.713 --> 02:52:14.375]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:14.396 --> 02:52:20.601]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:20.781 --> 02:52:25.826]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:26.326 --> 02:52:35.955]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:36.075 --> 02:52:38.176]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:38.416 --> 02:52:39.737]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:39.997 --> 02:52:42.279]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:42.459 --> 02:52:44.300]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:44.320 --> 02:52:49.363]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:49.743 --> 02:52:54.506]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:52:54.746 --> 02:52:58.848]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:53:01.028 --> 02:53:04.313]  America is in deep, deep trouble because we don't know our rights.
[02:53:04.634 --> 02:53:10.803]  Let's get real freedom back into America by teaching and promoting the Bill of Rights with the 2010 Freedom Calendar.
[02:53:11.023 --> 02:53:11.284]  Why?
[02:53:11.504 --> 02:53:13.347]  Because our forefathers gave them to us.
[02:53:13.527 --> 02:53:16.572]  Because the Freedom Calendar is true patriotism in action.
[02:53:16.812 --> 02:53:21.014]  And because if you don't know your rights and use them, you may lose them.
[02:53:21.234 --> 02:53:24.676]  The Freedom Calendar is the best educational tool in over 200 years.
[02:53:24.896 --> 02:53:30.498]  It shows in detail how to use your rights, how to answer any bureaucrat, how to use your guaranteed rights for true freedom.
[02:53:30.658 --> 02:53:36.461]  The Freedom Calendar is the easy way to learn the proper use and function of each of our rights, and is perfect for homeschoolers.
[02:53:36.661 --> 02:53:37.021]  I think so.
[02:54:00.626 --> 02:54:06.732]  France, part of the socialists, went to... to... became advocates of Hitler.
[02:54:08.553 --> 02:54:12.998]  The popular British playwright Bernard Shaw supported Hitler in the mass media.
[02:54:13.018 --> 02:54:16.901]  The left supported Hitler not because he deceived them.
[02:54:17.582 --> 02:54:19.243]  They knew Hitler would kill.
[02:54:19.824 --> 02:54:20.585]  He said he would.
[02:54:21.545 --> 02:54:25.169]  In fact, it was why they supported him.
[02:54:27.017 --> 02:54:33.659]  You must all know half a dozen people at least who are no use in this world, who are more trouble than they are worth.
[02:54:33.819 --> 02:54:40.001]  Just put them there and say, sir or madam, now will you be kind enough to justify your existence?
[02:54:41.341 --> 02:54:51.724]  If you can't justify your existence, if you're not pulling your weight in the social growth, if you're not producing as much as you consume, or perhaps a little more, then
[02:54:52.685 --> 02:55:04.944]  Clearly, we cannot use the big organization of our society for the purpose of keeping you alive, because your life does not benefit us, and it can't be of any much use to yourself.
[02:55:07.608 --> 02:55:08.429]  Better show him, then.
[02:55:10.353 --> 02:55:11.535]  We got a bunch of other clips.
[02:55:11.575 --> 02:55:12.936]  We didn't even get to the worst ones.
[02:55:13.497 --> 02:55:14.899]  Where he talks about the nerve gas.
[02:55:14.939 --> 02:55:16.241]  That's actually not the clip.
[02:55:16.401 --> 02:55:21.248]  There's another clip there where he talks about nerve gassing people.
[02:55:21.768 --> 02:55:23.330]  In fact, you have the nerve gas clip.
[02:55:23.390 --> 02:55:23.611]  Read it.
[02:55:25.486 --> 02:55:26.426]  Yeah, that's the clip we've got.
[02:55:26.466 --> 02:55:27.987]  It's all in this film, the Soviet story.
[02:55:28.007 --> 02:55:31.428]  I mean, it's the film clips of him saying, and then the Nazi quotes about what a great idea it was.
[02:55:50.148 --> 02:55:53.770]  I mean, this is a guy who loved Hitler, and he's loved by the left.
[02:55:54.330 --> 02:56:03.935]  I have been in college, and I have seen leftists, before I even knew who he was, walk up just to see if you're one of the fellow travelers, and they go, do you know George Bernard Shaw, the genius?
[02:56:04.536 --> 02:56:05.356]  No, I don't.
[02:56:05.376 --> 02:56:06.036]  And they go, hmm.
[02:56:06.337 --> 02:56:07.317]  Like, oh, you're not one of us.
[02:56:07.357 --> 02:56:09.998]  And they just sit around in rooms going, we're going to kill everyone.
[02:56:10.199 --> 02:56:11.019]  We're going to kill everyone.
[02:56:11.059 --> 02:56:11.719]  It's for the Earth.
[02:56:11.959 --> 02:56:18.003]  And they just get off on the idea that they're killing everyone, and they're going to decide if you can even be in a work camp.
[02:56:18.783 --> 02:56:21.245]  And if you can't, I'm sorry, you've got to die.
[02:56:22.146 --> 02:56:24.328]  And then you see Chris Matthews praising these people.
[02:56:24.368 --> 02:56:26.069]  That's a coded message to everyone.
[02:56:27.030 --> 02:56:28.692]  When he talks about how he likes these people.
[02:56:29.012 --> 02:56:30.133]  He's not a liberal at all.
[02:56:30.513 --> 02:56:31.354]  He doesn't love you.
[02:56:31.394 --> 02:56:32.515]  He rules you.
[02:56:32.535 --> 02:56:34.456]  He bankrupts you.
[02:56:34.497 --> 02:56:36.338]  He's a man who works for the bankers.
[02:56:36.919 --> 02:56:39.661]  These are savage people who know what they're doing.
[02:56:40.021 --> 02:56:40.862]  But they're liberals.
[02:56:40.902 --> 02:56:42.003]  You just, oh, you're liberal.
[02:56:42.423 --> 02:56:43.104]  Ah, I love you.
[02:56:43.124 --> 02:56:44.645]  I mean, it's just... Aaron?
[02:56:45.970 --> 02:56:56.082]  Yeah, I mean, all I could say is his quote from 1904, that nothing but a eugenic religion could save our civilization from the fate overtaken by all previous civilizations.
[02:56:57.064 --> 02:56:59.126]  He loves communism and all the rest of it.
[02:56:59.847 --> 02:57:02.450]  He says communism, fascism, just kill everybody.
[02:57:03.031 --> 02:57:04.132]  Just slaughter.
[02:57:05.083 --> 02:57:05.283]  Yeah.
[02:57:05.624 --> 02:57:09.987]  And now they're drugging our water, they're drugging our kids, they're drugging us, they're naked body scanning us.
[02:57:10.568 --> 02:57:12.549]  They are just raping us on all cylinders.
[02:57:12.610 --> 02:57:20.196]  I mean, literally, like every other culture, was crazy kings and priests going, bring me your children to the fire pit!
[02:57:20.697 --> 02:57:23.519]  Every culture demanded children in death and murder.
[02:57:23.879 --> 02:57:26.421]  Because psychopaths have the same mindset.
[02:57:27.102 --> 02:57:32.867]  Did the Catholic Church or Jews, the two favorite groups everybody demonizes, did they make the Aztec sacrifice?
[02:57:33.347 --> 02:57:35.309]  Did they make the Romans have the gladiators?
[02:57:35.969 --> 02:57:38.031]  No, ancient Jews sacrificed people.
[02:57:38.611 --> 02:57:39.892]  Every culture does it.
[02:57:39.932 --> 02:57:41.573]  They all have psychopaths.
[02:57:41.974 --> 02:57:47.078]  And so I'm fighting German and Chinese and Jewish and Catholic psychopaths.
[02:57:47.578 --> 02:57:49.260]  I'm fighting the elites of the planet.
[02:57:49.560 --> 02:57:57.970]  Psychopaths have gotten in control of every institution, and we need to start recognizing the psychopaths and taking them on and realizing how they operate.
[02:57:58.030 --> 02:57:58.751]  Aaron, do you agree with me?
[02:57:59.291 --> 02:57:59.852]  I do agree.
[02:57:59.892 --> 02:58:02.715]  I mean, that's why George Orwell, he was one of the Fabian socialists.
[02:58:02.735 --> 02:58:03.616]  He turned against them.
[02:58:03.976 --> 02:58:04.977]  He knew how bad it was.
[02:58:06.107 --> 02:58:08.129]  He knew they were for communism and killing.
[02:58:08.869 --> 02:58:10.650]  And that's why they say... That's how he knew.
[02:58:10.690 --> 02:58:12.091]  We are the priest of power, Winston.
[02:58:12.112 --> 02:58:13.813]  We're just gonna trample and be trampled on.
[02:58:13.993 --> 02:58:15.894]  We like to kill people, Winston!
[02:58:16.315 --> 02:58:17.135]  Don't you understand?
[02:58:17.175 --> 02:58:18.176]  And Winston goes, I see.
[02:58:18.236 --> 02:58:18.917]  Now I see it.
[02:58:19.537 --> 02:58:22.039]  You see, they say in 1984 the title was based on 1884, the year of Fabian Socialism.
[02:58:24.861 --> 02:58:25.622]  Yes, founded.
[02:58:25.962 --> 02:58:29.805]  And their insignia, their logo, is a wolf in sheep's clothing.
[02:58:30.226 --> 02:58:38.713]  And destroying society, destroying the language, with just a group who sets up a planet to carry out murder and slaughter for psychopaths, run by Ted Bundy.

[02:58:51.345 --> 02:58:53.949]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:58:54.350 --> 02:58:59.317]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:58:59.678 --> 02:59:01.420]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:59:01.741 --> 02:59:02.482]  In the battle for
