[00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:01.150]  I think?
[00:00:18.208 --> 00:00:19.590]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.673]  We're 33 minutes into this Friday, July 2, 2010 edition.
[00:00:22.713 --> 00:00:25.156]  Max Keiser of the Keiser Report is going to be popping in.
[00:00:34.085 --> 00:00:36.366]  ...with us for 15 minutes in the middle of the next hour.
[00:00:36.787 --> 00:00:40.269]  Then we have our once a week visit with Bob Chapman, the international forecaster.
[00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:49.755]  And in the last hour, we have a filmmaker who's made an amazing documentary about the private banking dictatorship that's taken over our society, but also...
[00:00:50.674 --> 00:00:57.716]  Of course, he's the maker of the film Money Masters, the quintessential documentary over 14 years ago that was produced.
[00:00:57.856 --> 00:01:05.698]  Bill Still exposing how this cabal of corporate hijackers took over our nation.
[00:01:06.298 --> 00:01:09.059]  He'll be joining us in the last hour today.
[00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:18.801]  Of course, Gerald Salente is the premier trends forecaster in the world, and he joins us once a month, but things are
[00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:33.574]  Getting so fast and furious and the birthing pains are getting closer and closer together as the war with Iran looms, as the mainstream media and the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Krugman admits it's the third depression.
[00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:37.315]  I'm hearing the term the greatest depression being used.
[00:01:37.475 --> 00:01:39.596]  Obama's talking about the greatest recession.
[00:01:39.616 --> 00:01:44.417]  So they're trying to spin Gerald Salente's term that he coined.
[00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:48.259]  Gerald Salente, of course, is in my film Fall of the Republic.
[00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.365]  The presidency of Barack H. Obama, and he's also in Obama Deception.
[00:01:53.986 --> 00:02:00.094]  And these two films really describe how this criminal network is bringing our society down by design.
[00:02:00.415 --> 00:02:04.040]  And so Gerald Cilente joins us for one segment today.
[00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:05.221]  I think?
[00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:20.189]  I don't
[00:02:35.526 --> 00:02:35.746]  Sure.
[00:02:57.877 --> 00:02:58.677]  Always my pleasure, Alex.
[00:03:21.906 --> 00:03:23.167]  Well, break it down for us.
[00:03:23.547 --> 00:03:31.314]  You, for the last two, three years, have been really with stunning accuracy chronicling exactly what was going to unfold.
[00:03:31.654 --> 00:03:40.222]  You predicted by the end of 2010 that they won't be able to deny that we are in a full-blown depression for the last two years, that they've been covering it up.
[00:03:40.562 --> 00:03:44.485]  Now, all the economic data is coming out, just piling onto your predictions.
[00:03:44.785 --> 00:03:46.026]  So go over your past
[00:03:46.767 --> 00:03:52.955]  Prediction and then tell us currently where we're at and any tweaking on your forecast of where we're going
[00:03:54.005 --> 00:04:07.196]  Well, in 2004, actually, we wrote in the Trends Journal, and it's on our website, TrendsJournal.com, that by the end of 2007, we'd enter, quote, the Great Recession.
[00:04:07.937 --> 00:04:14.663]  In 2007, we warned, we even took the domain name out, and it was one of our top trends for 2008, the Panic of 08.
[00:04:17.665 --> 00:04:20.627]  Then we forecast in 08 the collapse of 09.
[00:04:21.187 --> 00:04:24.429]  The markets collapsed in March of 09.
[00:04:25.209 --> 00:04:33.254]  And the only thing that they did was to pump them up with bailout and stimulus money worldwide.
[00:04:34.015 --> 00:04:34.575]  China.
[00:04:35.575 --> 00:04:36.416]  All of Europe.
[00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:49.503]  The UK, Australia, Japan, South Korea, you name the company, the company, that's the right word, I meant to say country, but company fits, because that's the ones they're bailing out.
[00:04:49.903 --> 00:04:51.423]  The banks, the big companies.
[00:04:51.724 --> 00:04:54.004]  They flooded the world with stimulus money.
[00:04:54.304 --> 00:04:56.045]  The games ran out.
[00:04:56.325 --> 00:04:58.286]  The game ran out with the Greek crisis.
[00:04:58.746 --> 00:05:05.228]  So now what we have is the reality, and now as you mentioned, you're hearing people like Krugman
[00:05:07.308 --> 00:05:13.589]  The New York Times, Alex, calls what I have to say, pessimism porn.
[00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:32.133]  So therefore, Krugman, from the toilet paper of record, comes out two years too late, and a couple of weeks behind, saying that, quote, he fears that we're going to enter into a depression.
[00:05:32.873 --> 00:05:33.494]  Fears?
[00:05:34.515 --> 00:05:39.002]  Oh, but if they listen to Krugman and company, they could get out of it.
[00:05:39.282 --> 00:05:42.266]  Because he says it's about policy.
[00:05:42.727 --> 00:05:49.556]  And the policy that he recommends is dump more money into the system, more stimulus.
[00:05:50.257 --> 00:05:54.338]  So that it's like you having a third, a second mortgage.
[00:05:54.658 --> 00:05:55.939]  You can't pay it off.
[00:05:56.299 --> 00:06:02.521]  And I say, hey, listen, Alex, how about taking out a third mortgage so you could pile some more debt on top of it?
[00:06:02.961 --> 00:06:04.261]  So the games run out.
[00:06:04.921 --> 00:06:07.502]  They're not going to throw any more stimulus into this.
[00:06:08.002 --> 00:06:09.623]  It is austerity.
[00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:16.145]  Austerity means, by the way, you take pay cuts and you pay higher taxes to bail out the banks.
[00:06:16.605 --> 00:06:18.646]  We're going into the greatest depression.
[00:06:19.066 --> 00:06:19.546]  However,
[00:06:20.742 --> 00:06:23.083]  They're also taking us on the path to war.
[00:06:23.363 --> 00:06:26.424]  And this is what we wrote when the bailouts began.
[00:06:26.524 --> 00:06:34.688]  When the bailout bubble bursts, when all else fails, they become emboldened by their failures and they take us to war.
[00:06:35.048 --> 00:06:36.488]  That's what we fear is next.
[00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:39.730]  Gerald Salente is our guest.
[00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.071]  Gerald, we're now seeing Schwarzenegger.
[00:06:44.662 --> 00:06:48.204]  Make 200,000 employees of California take minimum wage.
[00:06:48.645 --> 00:06:53.708]  Some of these are 10, 20, 30 year employees who were making $20, $30 an hour.
[00:06:54.168 --> 00:06:57.991]  Now they're supposed to live on $6 an hour.
[00:06:58.611 --> 00:07:05.216]  We see Bloomberg reporting that 46 states are bankrupt or on the verge of going bankrupt.
[00:07:06.056 --> 00:07:12.439]  And the government's answer is raise federal and state taxes by record levels in modern history.
[00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:14.680]  And California did that two years ago.
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.101]  And lo and behold, their tax receipts went down.
[00:07:17.421 --> 00:07:19.482]  Kennedy cut taxes by 50 percent.
[00:07:19.802 --> 00:07:20.742]  Tax receipts doubled.
[00:07:21.083 --> 00:07:26.525]  Government knows when you cut taxes, more money comes in because the economy speeds up and becomes more healthy.
[00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:27.966]  So then by this
[00:07:28.967 --> 00:07:34.060]  Measurement, they know that the taxes increasing is going to further destroy the economy.
[00:07:34.542 --> 00:07:36.226]  What is the method to the madness?
[00:07:37.657 --> 00:07:38.598]  Look who they are.
[00:07:39.418 --> 00:07:48.103]  As I mentioned, these are the people we used to go to high school and college with that wanted to become the class president and the head of the student council.
[00:07:48.583 --> 00:07:57.188]  They were suck-ups, brown-nosers, self-serving, ambitious jerks that most people didn't want to hang around with.
[00:07:57.548 --> 00:07:59.549]  They followed their career paths.
[00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.711]  They've been incompetence forever.
[00:08:02.171 --> 00:08:03.732]  Let's look at the facts.
[00:08:04.252 --> 00:08:07.177]  They have Katrina quality rescue skills.
[00:08:07.517 --> 00:08:10.221]  Hey, great job you're doing over there in the Gulf.
[00:08:10.842 --> 00:08:13.066]  How about fixing health care?
[00:08:13.106 --> 00:08:13.987]  No, I have it.
[00:08:14.428 --> 00:08:15.009]  Why not?
[00:08:15.089 --> 00:08:17.012]  Let's reform education.
[00:08:17.413 --> 00:08:19.316]  Let's start a war on drugs.
[00:08:19.796 --> 00:08:21.016]  Let's go bigger than that.
[00:08:21.356 --> 00:08:24.037]  Let's have wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[00:08:24.317 --> 00:08:25.358]  They're losers.
[00:08:25.938 --> 00:08:29.499]  Everything they touch, they turn to rot.
[00:08:29.959 --> 00:08:31.579]  They are incapable.
[00:08:31.919 --> 00:08:42.142]  And if you want to start cutting back, let's start cutting back on these jumbo jets that the secretaries of this and that ride around in.
[00:08:42.442 --> 00:08:48.224]  And every time they go and make a state visit, it's the same predictable scene.
[00:08:48.584 --> 00:09:01.852]  Here they are, waving from the gangway to a crowd below of other dignitaries, bowing and scraping when they roll out a red carpet and strike up the band.
[00:09:02.412 --> 00:09:04.794]  Who is kidding who with this stuff?
[00:09:05.134 --> 00:09:06.535]  They're robbing us blind.
[00:09:06.575 --> 00:09:08.256]  They're living like royalty.
[00:09:08.576 --> 00:09:16.161]  They're cutting back on everybody's salaries so the people at the top could keep the game going the same.
[00:09:18.007 --> 00:09:19.228]  And it's coming to a head.
[00:09:19.308 --> 00:09:34.056]  I mean, when you realize they spend billions and billions a year just for Congress people to fly around on the equivalent of Air Force One type jets, and you're correct, it's in the news that even their aides and secretaries are flying on private jets.
[00:09:34.096 --> 00:09:35.997]  Meanwhile, I fly coach.
[00:09:38.957 --> 00:09:40.458]  I mean, this cannot continue.
[00:09:40.498 --> 00:09:43.700]  It just shows their Marie Antoinette attitude.
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:10:05.236]  And speaking of that, this article, Dollar Plunge, after UN called to ditch Greenback, the G20 meets, these 20 central bankers, most of them Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Goldman Sachs alumni, they've stolen trillions of dollars publicly, they engineered the Ponzi scheme, and $1.2 billion is spent on their security.
[00:10:05.536 --> 00:10:08.318]  That is almost the budget of Toronto every year
[00:10:08.758 --> 00:10:28.260]  In three days, I mean just to show how unsustainable this is, how they want to bankrupt us, and the United Nations says that the dollar is going to be dead, that other currencies are going to be dead, and that we have to set up a world government, and that's what these banks have been pushing for decades, where we pay carbon taxes to the central banks
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:33.422]  To issue a new SDR that our money is backed up by.
[00:10:33.442 --> 00:10:35.102]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:10:35.142 --> 00:10:51.148]  The very same crooks that have done all of this say their solution is give them more power and Obama's banking reform bill, even the Washington Post admits, gives unlimited power to the Federal Reserve to manage all sectors of the economy.
[00:10:51.368 --> 00:10:53.109]  So we have a banking dictatorship.
[00:10:53.129 --> 00:10:58.091]  I mean, you know, Gerald, the media is so worried about 11 Russian spies, supposedly, over here.
[00:10:58.311 --> 00:11:02.715]  You notice they were infiltrating Harvard and corporations because that's the government.
[00:11:02.975 --> 00:11:06.259]  Those are the governments, like you always say, Harvard's what's hijacked America.
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.983]  The Russians know what to infiltrate because we don't have a government.
[00:11:11.243 --> 00:11:18.350]  Congress is ceremonial and globalism is a private corporate takeover of a bunch of arrogant yuppie scum.
[00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:19.071]  Your take on this?
[00:11:20.151 --> 00:11:24.936]  Well, you hit it on the head with what the UN is talking about with the one currency.
[00:11:25.977 --> 00:11:26.998]  And it's happening.
[00:11:27.139 --> 00:11:30.642]  And that's why we fear it's going... That's why I mentioned the war card.
[00:11:30.983 --> 00:11:35.247]  If the war card is played, they'll frighten the people into something like that.
[00:11:35.968 --> 00:11:40.351]  We're watching the Euro disintegrate in front of our eyes.
[00:11:40.732 --> 00:11:43.954]  There's going to be a time when the countries are going to be bailing out of it.
[00:11:44.294 --> 00:11:52.461]  Nobody's meeting the Maastricht Agreement accords on their ratios of budget deficits, GDP, etc.
[00:11:52.961 --> 00:11:56.804]  So what we're looking at, again, current events form future trends.
[00:11:57.164 --> 00:11:59.106]  What's the Dow at now, Alex?
[00:11:59.546 --> 00:12:01.387]  It's at March 1999 levels.
[00:12:03.669 --> 00:12:04.830]  Hey, stay in the market.
[00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:05.691]  Don't worry about it.
[00:12:05.711 --> 00:12:07.112]  This is a buying opportunity.
[00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:09.093]  You have to be in it for the long term.
[00:12:09.394 --> 00:12:11.255]  What was gold doing back in 1999?
[00:12:11.415 --> 00:12:15.619]  Oh, it was around $250 an ounce.
[00:12:16.059 --> 00:12:17.160]  Oh, and what's it today?
[00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.702]  Oh, around $1,200 an ounce.
[00:12:19.942 --> 00:12:21.743]  But you know, buy stock.
[00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:28.449]  And they make fun of everybody that wants to buy gold, particularly the toilet paper of record.
[00:12:28.769 --> 00:12:30.931]  They call us gold bugs.
[00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:33.213]  Gloom and doomers!
[00:12:33.613 --> 00:12:36.276]  Because we don't buy into their line of baloney.
[00:12:36.656 --> 00:12:43.263]  Remember I talked about the people that we couldn't stand that wanted to be the class presidents and the student council heads?
[00:12:43.283 --> 00:12:51.431]  No, I've noticed that all these globalists, it doesn't matter if it's George Bush or Rick Perry or Trent Lott or Al Gore, they're all male cheerleaders.
[00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:52.492]  Exactly!
[00:12:52.512 --> 00:12:53.873]  The biggest kiss-butt slimeballs.
[00:12:53.953 --> 00:12:55.255]  And there's the other ones, Alex.
[00:12:55.715 --> 00:13:00.036]  The other ones were the writers for the school newspaper!
[00:13:00.416 --> 00:13:01.296]  Here they are!
[00:13:01.316 --> 00:13:03.777]  Here, they're in front of us!
[00:13:03.837 --> 00:13:05.778]  They're Brian Williams!
[00:13:06.118 --> 00:13:07.658]  They're Katie Couric!
[00:13:07.698 --> 00:13:09.018]  They're Matt Lowers!
[00:13:09.418 --> 00:13:13.499]  They're the people that used to write things about the president!
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.520]  The principal, excuse me!
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.280]  It's high school!
[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:19.461]  Nothing has changed!
[00:13:19.861 --> 00:13:25.783]  They're tame little reporters saying what the principal wants them to say.
[00:13:26.144 --> 00:13:29.005]  They get away with murder, literally.
[00:13:29.265 --> 00:13:37.748]  And by the way, talking about murder, I'm sick of hearing these lefties talk about, oh, these Tea Party people are crazy.
[00:13:38.028 --> 00:13:45.291]  Boy, if they got into power, oh yeah, they'd be sending predator drones into Pakistan and killing innocent people.
[00:13:45.751 --> 00:13:49.433]  Oh yeah, they'd be escalating the war in Afghanistan.
[00:13:49.973 --> 00:13:53.256]  Oh yeah, they'd be putting huge military bases in Iraq.
[00:13:54.437 --> 00:13:56.099]  They're worried about the Tea Party.
[00:13:56.119 --> 00:13:57.480]  They'd be continuing torture.
[00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:01.684]  They would be introducing legislation to secretly arrest citizens.
[00:14:01.764 --> 00:14:02.845]  Oh, that's the Democrats.
[00:14:03.586 --> 00:14:04.407]  Oh yeah, right.
[00:14:04.747 --> 00:14:06.429]  I thought it was the Tea Party people.
[00:14:07.725 --> 00:14:17.555]  Well, Gerald, specifically, because you've said that you, and you've been saying this for the last year, that you see the total depression collapse, or the media admitting we're in a depression, by the end of 2010.
[00:14:18.836 --> 00:14:27.124]  How do you see that unrolling, and in which direction do you see a new international order emerging?
[00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:33.529]  The direction of the new international order emerging, it has to get to a catastrophic level.
[00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:35.729]  And that's what we fear about war.
[00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:39.050]  And the depression is unfolding in front of us now.
[00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:42.632]  What were today's unemployment numbers?
[00:14:42.732 --> 00:14:43.572]  Oh, they increased!
[00:14:43.872 --> 00:14:44.892]  Gee, son of a gun!
[00:14:45.192 --> 00:14:46.393]  All those factory orders?
[00:14:47.133 --> 00:14:49.395]  You know, they were worse than, quote, expected.
[00:14:49.435 --> 00:14:50.476]  Expected by whom?
[00:14:50.956 --> 00:14:53.598]  Oh, how about those new home sales that collapsed?
[00:14:54.299 --> 00:14:55.180]  It's in front of us.
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:55.920]  It's going.
[00:14:57.121 --> 00:14:59.643]  All the data is adding up to a crash.
[00:15:00.104 --> 00:15:02.766]  We believe it's going to be a currency crash.
[00:15:03.106 --> 00:15:07.169]  That's our best estimate in thinking about this at the point.
[00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:11.213]  It's going to be a currency crash that's going to collapse the markets.
[00:15:12.677 --> 00:15:16.600]  Break that down, because you've talked about how all major currencies are doomed.
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:38.434]  You, Ron Paul, countless other economists and researchers have stated that this fractional reserve banking system is designed to consolidate power in the Ponzi scheme operator's hands, and we're now reaching that global meltdown, and the UN says that all major currencies are going to fail, but again, their answer is a world government backed up by carbon taxes.
[00:15:39.115 --> 00:15:40.296]  How do you see that unfolding?
[00:15:41.175 --> 00:15:43.596]  What we see first is a collapsing in Europe.
[00:15:43.616 --> 00:15:44.716]  They can't sustain it.
[00:15:44.956 --> 00:15:48.578]  If you think our banks are in bad shape, theirs are in even worse.
[00:15:48.998 --> 00:15:54.540]  And I'm sick of hearing this is an American-grown problem with our subprime mortgages.
[00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:56.161]  It's much bigger than that.
[00:15:56.481 --> 00:16:04.864]  You go to Spain, Ireland, you go around, they overbuilt these areas just like they did in Florida and Las Vegas.
[00:16:05.204 --> 00:16:06.525]  They have their own stuff.
[00:16:07.305 --> 00:16:14.972]  And so we're looking at the central banks in Europe are doing exactly what they said they weren't going to do.
[00:16:15.313 --> 00:16:17.675]  They're buying up all the bad paper.
[00:16:18.035 --> 00:16:19.196]  It's going to run out.
[00:16:19.216 --> 00:16:22.179]  We believe the collapse is going to happen in Europe.
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.102]  Oh, and here's what's going to happen before then.
[00:16:25.562 --> 00:16:27.965]  We're going to start seeing more and more terrorism.
[00:16:28.565 --> 00:16:30.807]  And what you saw happen in Toronto,
[00:16:31.468 --> 00:16:33.689]  They know what's going on.
[00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:35.349]  That was a test.
[00:16:35.669 --> 00:16:40.671]  What did they spend at the G20 meeting to protect the, quote, leaders?
[00:16:40.751 --> 00:16:41.451]  What leaders?
[00:16:41.791 --> 00:16:45.592]  A leader isn't a... doesn't have fear to walk by themselves.
[00:16:45.852 --> 00:16:49.774]  They don't have to spend a billion dollars to protect them.
[00:16:50.194 --> 00:16:55.635]  That was a... The people are uprising around the world.
[00:16:55.995 --> 00:16:57.456]  So that's what we're looking at.
[00:16:57.836 --> 00:16:59.376]  Simultaneous issues.
[00:16:59.877 --> 00:17:00.557]  Terrorism.
[00:17:01.617 --> 00:17:10.288]  Uprisings by the populations, a currency crisis, and equity markets collapsing at the same time.
[00:17:10.648 --> 00:17:11.729]  And you know what, Alex?
[00:17:13.444 --> 00:17:23.849]  The BP disaster, unfortunately, looks as though it's going to be the dust bowl of the 21st century.
[00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:32.893]  Gerald Solente, I was just going to have you for one second because I know you're busy today, but can you come back with a little five-minute segment and give us your breakdown on where the oil spill is going?
[00:17:33.573 --> 00:17:34.253]  Yes, I can.
[00:17:34.574 --> 00:17:34.954]  Excellent.
[00:17:34.994 --> 00:17:35.414]  Thank you.
[00:17:35.454 --> 00:17:37.195]  Gerald Salente is our guest.
[00:17:37.215 --> 00:17:44.359]  We'll give you his website on the other side and tell you how to subscribe to his must-read Trends Journal.
[00:17:44.739 --> 00:17:51.962]  If you're a business owner, or you're a mother, a father, if you're in government, if you're in law enforcement, everyone should read the Trends Journal.
[00:17:52.082 --> 00:17:52.723]  I know I do.
[00:17:53.083 --> 00:17:56.345]  Gerald Salente is the real deal, and we're honored to have him.
[00:17:56.385 --> 00:17:56.865]  Stay with us.
[00:17:59.397 --> 00:18:00.297]  Global meltdowns.
[00:18:00.637 --> 00:18:01.678]  Massive unemployment.
[00:18:02.058 --> 00:18:02.838]  Endless wars.
[00:18:03.258 --> 00:18:04.499]  A new currency crisis.
[00:18:04.919 --> 00:18:06.640]  Financially and morally bankrupt.
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:08.841]  A great and terrible storm is approaching.
[00:18:09.141 --> 00:18:10.781]  So what's the best way to get ready?
[00:18:11.041 --> 00:18:12.742]  To get prepared for hard times ahead.
[00:18:13.122 --> 00:18:14.703]  Introducing Off The Grid News.
[00:18:15.103 --> 00:18:21.305]  A weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[00:18:21.605 --> 00:18:26.547]  It's the best way to get a black belt in emergency preparedness, survival skills, and off-the-grid living.
[00:18:26.887 --> 00:18:28.788]  Off The Grid News is fiercely independent
[00:18:29.088 --> 00:18:38.853]  All about self-reliance and packed with helpful information on survival gardening, food preparation, alternative energy, herbal medicines, privacy and security, as well as God, gold and guns.
[00:18:39.153 --> 00:18:40.973]  With absolutely no apologies.
[00:18:41.294 --> 00:18:41.954]  And the best part?
[00:18:42.114 --> 00:18:45.816]  This $100 a year service is now free of charge for our listeners.
[00:18:46.176 --> 00:18:50.198]  That's right, free for our listeners who sign up at OffTheGridNews.com.

[00:18:58.723 --> 00:19:01.045]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:19:01.106 --> 00:19:03.328]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:19:03.448 --> 00:19:06.351]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:19:06.651 --> 00:19:11.396]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:19:11.757 --> 00:19:15.961]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:19:16.261 --> 00:19:18.585]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:19:18.605 --> 00:19:21.129]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:19:21.149 --> 00:19:24.073]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:19:24.413 --> 00:19:32.025]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:19:32.345 --> 00:19:37.608]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:19:37.728 --> 00:19:40.009]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:19:40.589 --> 00:19:44.011]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:19:44.271 --> 00:19:45.191]  And I got news for you.
[00:19:45.351 --> 00:19:46.612]  You're everyone else.
[00:19:46.692 --> 00:19:47.733]  Invisible Empire.

[00:21:04.696 --> 00:21:05.497]  The M.O.
[00:21:05.738 --> 00:21:09.806]  of this global corporate crime syndicate that's overthrowing every nation on earth...
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.181]  ...is to create a crisis and offer their solution.
[00:21:14.602 --> 00:21:17.263]  That's why it's so important to get the film Fall of the Republic.
[00:21:17.824 --> 00:21:25.609]  Because it details who these people are, what they've done, how they're going to abolish the world currencies or devalue them, and then have this new SDR.
[00:21:26.009 --> 00:21:28.150]  I made this film six months ago, Fall of the Republic.
[00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:30.171]  I made the Obama deception 14 months ago.
[00:21:31.252 --> 00:21:32.433]  These films are evergreen.
[00:21:32.453 --> 00:21:34.155]  They're more pertinent today than they ever were.
[00:21:34.635 --> 00:21:37.798]  Get them on DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:21:38.418 --> 00:21:42.262]  Now, going back to Gerald Salente of the Trends Research Institute.
[00:21:42.282 --> 00:21:47.106]  Gerald, I want you to get into the oil spill and where you see that going, and you're comparing it to the Dust Bowl.
[00:21:47.126 --> 00:21:50.349]  I think that's an excellent parallel.
[00:21:50.389 --> 00:21:57.876]  But first, tell us about the Trends Research Institute, the website, TrendsResearch.com, and how people can subscribe to it.
[00:21:58.837 --> 00:22:01.080]  Well, our Trends Journal is a quarterly.
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:04.483]  We're coming out with a summer edition in just a few weeks.
[00:22:05.064 --> 00:22:09.549]  And we have a discount request page as well, because we know people are having a difficult time.
[00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:11.792]  We try to make it available to everyone.
[00:22:12.252 --> 00:22:16.957]  And in this upcoming Trends Journal, there'll be a white paper done by Dr. Robert Schock.
[00:22:18.519 --> 00:22:43.619]  The distinguished geologist who's renowned for his work, along with my colleague and executive editor of the Trends Journal, John Anthony West, who's proven geologically that the weathering at the base of the Sphinx is 10,000 years older than currently dated, which means that it predates the Sahara Desert and that we weren't hunters and gatherers when they built this.
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:46.822]  Well, Dr. Schock has done a white paper
[00:22:47.362 --> 00:22:48.923]  On the oil disaster.
[00:22:49.583 --> 00:22:53.645]  And the short of it is that this is not a leaking pipe.
[00:22:54.366 --> 00:22:55.466]  This is a fracture.
[00:22:56.447 --> 00:23:00.989]  And the damage is going to be far greater than what they're telling us it's going to be.
[00:23:01.529 --> 00:23:05.091]  So there's going to be a lot more of that in this paper.
[00:23:05.171 --> 00:23:11.294]  So we see this as a disaster that, you know, it can be those kind of things that just keep adding up.
[00:23:11.954 --> 00:23:17.399]  If we have, uh, hey, how about building some more nuclear power plants?
[00:23:17.419 --> 00:23:20.161]  That Obama's alternative energy plan.
[00:23:20.542 --> 00:23:24.465]  Yeah, a couple of more Chernobyls, a couple of more big oil leaks.
[00:23:24.745 --> 00:23:26.887]  Oh, let's start a real good war.
[00:23:27.227 --> 00:23:28.829]  Shoot off a couple of nukes.
[00:23:29.469 --> 00:23:34.215]  And maybe the mystery of the Sphinx won't be a mystery anymore.
[00:23:34.675 --> 00:23:43.085]  Civilizations may wipe themselves out because we have the imbeciles in control now that are leading us down that path.
[00:23:44.206 --> 00:23:45.467]  What's going to happen to Obama?
[00:23:45.487 --> 00:23:47.570]  He now has the lowest approval rating ever.
[00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:49.772]  He's topped even his previous record.
[00:23:50.934 --> 00:23:53.977]  They know that they have destroyed themselves politically.
[00:23:54.438 --> 00:23:58.603]  Every incumbent, whether they be Republican or Democrat, has been losing in the primaries.
[00:23:58.623 --> 00:24:01.986]  This is a political realignment that you predicted four years ago.
[00:24:02.547 --> 00:24:03.648]  Where do you see that going?
[00:24:04.423 --> 00:24:05.484]  A new third party.
[00:24:05.584 --> 00:24:08.165]  We're calling it progressive libertarian at this point.
[00:24:08.546 --> 00:24:10.847]  Progressive in terms of environmental issues.
[00:24:11.187 --> 00:24:17.491]  The things, the advertisers you have on your show about foods and heirloom seeds, etc.
[00:24:18.371 --> 00:24:23.054]  Environmental with, progressive in terms of education.
[00:24:23.334 --> 00:24:25.115]  Not the stupid system we have now.
[00:24:25.476 --> 00:24:27.317]  And libertarian in the Ron Paul
[00:24:27.937 --> 00:24:46.133]  Pat Buchanan field of not becoming involved in foreign entanglements, having sleazeballs like Spitzer, the governor of New York, putting laws into place, breaking John's for going out with prostitutes as he's paying for high paid ones down in Washington DC.
[00:24:46.433 --> 00:24:51.218]  Libertarian in a sense as of that in government getting out of your business.
[00:24:51.738 --> 00:24:53.219]  So that's what we see happening.
[00:24:53.539 --> 00:25:02.402]  If that party is stopped by the control of the two-headed, one-party system, who are the Democrats and Republicans going to put up?
[00:25:02.502 --> 00:25:05.583]  So Obama runs, who are the Republicans going to put up?
[00:25:05.803 --> 00:25:07.564]  Hey, how about John McCain again?
[00:25:07.904 --> 00:25:08.705]  Or Bonner?
[00:25:09.005 --> 00:25:09.945]  Or Shelby?
[00:25:10.565 --> 00:25:11.826]  Or Mickey Mouse?
[00:25:13.306 --> 00:25:16.548]  Mitt Romney and the fainter Petraeus.
[00:25:17.048 --> 00:25:20.590]  Gerald Cilente, we'll talk to you again later in the month for a full hour interview.
[00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:22.871]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.

[00:25:27.232 --> 00:25:31.214]  I wish you weren't right, but it's better to know what's going on than to be ignorant in the dark.
[00:25:31.474 --> 00:25:32.475]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[00:25:32.995 --> 00:25:33.335]  Thank you.
[00:25:33.775 --> 00:25:34.856]  There goes Gerald Cilente.
[00:25:35.076 --> 00:25:37.197]  We'll be back in 70 seconds with a second hour.

[00:27:03.294 --> 00:27:07.476]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:27:08.137 --> 00:27:08.937]  You want answers?
[00:27:09.718 --> 00:27:10.638]  Well, so does he.
[00:27:11.279 --> 00:27:14.861]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:15.461 --> 00:27:19.563]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27:20.544 --> 00:27:24.306]  We just had Gerald Salente from the Trends Research Institute on for 30 minutes.
[00:27:25.086 --> 00:27:27.067]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, Max Keiser joins us.
[00:27:27.167 --> 00:27:29.429]  I want to open the phones up some, but I also want to get
[00:27:30.109 --> 00:27:32.292]  Back into dollar plunges after a U.N.
[00:27:32.332 --> 00:27:33.874]  call to ditch Greenback.
[00:27:33.914 --> 00:27:37.038]  I've been covering this since CNN and the U.N.
[00:27:37.358 --> 00:27:39.440]  started putting out this propaganda on Tuesday.
[00:27:40.141 --> 00:27:45.368]  Now I know this is old news to our listeners and old news to anybody that's seen Fall of the Republic or Obama deception.
[00:27:46.761 --> 00:28:02.466]  Or Endgame, that I made almost four years ago, because it's all stated what they planned, how they would destroy the economy, how they would... You'd still have your currency, but it'll be based on a world government system and backed up by carbon taxes, and above that will be these SDRs.
[00:28:02.546 --> 00:28:08.648]  I'm gonna be discussing that, but I'm gonna tell the story after the break.
[00:28:08.668 --> 00:28:09.889]  Let's take a call right now.
[00:28:10.469 --> 00:28:12.350]  Erica in California, you're on the air.
[00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:13.070]  Welcome, Erica.
[00:28:14.266 --> 00:28:15.307]  Hi Alex, how are you today?
[00:28:15.327 --> 00:28:17.189]  I'm excellent, thank you for joining us.
[00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:24.697]  Sure, well I was just calling in response to your request at the beginning of the show about what the 4th of July means to you.
[00:28:24.997 --> 00:28:26.018]  Hoorah!
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:34.427]  Exactly, and you know my parents emigrated here from a small country called Latvia, so I'm first generation in the United States.
[00:28:35.219 --> 00:28:39.682]  You know, they waited five years in displaced persons camps, you know, to come here legally.
[00:28:40.022 --> 00:28:43.784]  My mom's family couldn't even come to the States because they weren't able to get a sponsor.
[00:28:44.244 --> 00:28:44.545]  Wow.
[00:28:44.645 --> 00:28:48.887]  So I grew up, yeah, and they ended up meeting my dad and we know she's here now.
[00:28:48.947 --> 00:28:55.811]  But, you know, I grew up with my grandparents telling me all the stories about, you know, what they went through to literally escape Stalin's regime.
[00:28:56.532 --> 00:29:00.034]  I had family members who were on the dreaded list and got the knock on the door.
[00:29:00.314 --> 00:29:03.276]  And, you know, I had family members who were, who were, um,
[00:29:03.903 --> 00:29:07.844]  Hiding out in the woods for weeks just to not have to be taken away.
[00:29:08.044 --> 00:29:13.345]  So, you know, I grew up with a real appreciation for what my family had gone through to come to this amazing country.
[00:29:14.405 --> 00:29:21.007]  And, you know, to be where we are now, you know, arguably one generation later, it's, uh, it's unbelievable to me.
[00:29:21.067 --> 00:29:22.707]  I'm the mom of a five year old little girl.
[00:29:22.987 --> 00:29:29.989]  And, you know, to see where we are now and to realize like, wow, you know, my parents were able to escape that to come here and here we are.
[00:29:30.009 --> 00:29:30.829]  And like, where would we go?
[00:29:31.581 --> 00:29:35.366]  Well, I mean, the saying is, those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
[00:29:35.847 --> 00:29:39.713]  Humans behave the same, whether it was 5,000 years ago, 100 years ago, or today.
[00:29:39.733 --> 00:29:46.482]  There's just a high-tech overlay, and the propaganda is a lot more flowery and fancy.
[00:29:47.003 --> 00:30:02.633]  But we know this means bondage and being a slave is a horrible thing and living under an oppressive system where all these little nobodies get to rule over you and have their way with your women and your men and to see your men and your children drug away.
[00:30:03.533 --> 00:30:08.457]  I mean, in the history books, the CPS will be known as the Stalin's NKVD of America.
[00:30:09.758 --> 00:30:24.350]  And to talk to Eastern Europeans and the hell they went through, and to talk to Germans and people who suffered at the hands of Hitler, we know what black uniforms and black masks and secret arrests and knocks on the door and political police mean 100% of the time.
[00:30:26.131 --> 00:30:30.212]  And this is an even more sophisticated evil, and this is a life-and-death situation.
[00:30:30.552 --> 00:30:35.534]  And that's why I really like people who've come from true tyrannies, because they value freedom.
[00:30:35.554 --> 00:30:43.416]  I mean, if you go back to our forefathers, they had an experience with tyranny, and that's why they were serious and focused.
[00:30:43.476 --> 00:30:45.817]  It was the French philosopher
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:58.888]  Victor Hugo, who said that hard times and tragedy makes men, and plenty and decadence makes monsters, to paraphrase him.
[00:30:59.209 --> 00:31:00.329]  He said it much more simply.
[00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:09.116]  I'm paraphrasing it, but absolutely, we've turned into decadent slobs, and we don't understand what is upon us right now.
[00:31:09.176 --> 00:31:09.596]  Anything else?
[00:31:10.917 --> 00:31:15.961]  Yeah, well, it's funny because I actually was a history major at Harvard, but I was one of the good guys.
[00:31:16.718 --> 00:31:25.481]  And you know it's in the books and I think very recently I've just gotten even more chilled like sleepless nights just thinking about what's going on because it has happened.
[00:31:25.521 --> 00:31:29.882]  It's happened to good people and the fact that people around me don't even see it.
[00:31:30.662 --> 00:31:32.783]  I'm doing the best I can to people.
[00:31:33.923 --> 00:31:35.124]  And sharing your movies.
[00:31:35.184 --> 00:31:41.448]  I think the Don't Tread on Me movie that you have on your website is amazing in terms of educating people.
[00:31:41.548 --> 00:31:42.349]  Erica, stay there.
[00:31:42.389 --> 00:31:49.294]  I want you to be able to finish up your point and talk about some of what your folks went through in Eastern Europe under Stalin and others.
[00:31:49.654 --> 00:31:52.536]  Then we'll go to George, Mark, Derry, Chris and others.
[00:31:52.876 --> 00:31:53.317]  Stay with us.
[00:31:58.188 --> 00:32:02.151]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:32:02.371 --> 00:32:08.415]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:32:08.775 --> 00:32:15.880]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:20.743]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:32:21.044 --> 00:32:23.185]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:32:25.987 --> 00:32:29.513]  Or see them online at FiveStarSoap.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:32:29.693 --> 00:32:33.419]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:32:33.956 --> 00:32:40.119]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:32:40.719 --> 00:32:44.141]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:32:44.621 --> 00:32:51.925]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:32:52.045 --> 00:32:52.505]  Thank you.
[00:32:59.775 --> 00:33:03.398]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:33:03.738 --> 00:33:11.863]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:33:12.604 --> 00:33:16.627]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:33:17.227 --> 00:33:28.055]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:33:28.675 --> 00:33:37.679]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:43.242]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:33:43.622 --> 00:33:50.785]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:33:51.106 --> 00:33:53.507]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:33:57.602 --> 00:34:01.845]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:34:02.166 --> 00:34:02.766]  Number 1.
[00:34:03.086 --> 00:34:06.229]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:34:06.509 --> 00:34:07.069]  Number 2.
[00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:11.913]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:34:12.253 --> 00:34:12.694]  It's true.
[00:34:12.994 --> 00:34:17.557]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:34:17.878 --> 00:34:18.418]  Number 3.
[00:34:18.698 --> 00:34:21.981]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:34:22.281 --> 00:34:25.984]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:34:26.184 --> 00:34:26.725]  Number 4.
[00:34:26.985 --> 00:34:29.347]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:34:29.747 --> 00:34:33.130]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:34:33.410 --> 00:34:33.631]  Number 5.
[00:34:34.211 --> 00:34:38.134]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:34:38.355 --> 00:34:43.119]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:34:43.399 --> 00:34:47.422]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:34:47.563 --> 00:34:49.124]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:34:49.364 --> 00:34:51.446]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:34:51.606 --> 00:34:54.208]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:34:54.228 --> 00:35:02.015]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:35:02.495 --> 00:35:05.317]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:35:08.438 --> 00:35:13.799]  We got Max Keiser popping in to talk about dollar plunge after UN called a ditch greenback.
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:17.020]  And what it's going to mean when the dollar gets devalued.
[00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:23.902]  It's already being slowly devalued and over time it's what lost 97 plus percent of its value since 1913.
[00:35:24.022 --> 00:35:30.483]  But that last three percent that's all we got is the fact that worldwide that's our main export.
[00:35:32.183 --> 00:35:34.444]  So the globalist will really
[00:35:35.885 --> 00:35:37.966]  Really have us under their thumb after this happens.
[00:35:38.046 --> 00:35:43.529]  And what incredible treason by the Federal Reserve to be at these meetings and calling for the end of the greenback.
[00:35:43.949 --> 00:35:54.475]  We actually have that clip in Fall of the Republic where Geithner gets asked about the basket of currencies and the new global currency, the SDR, and he says, yes, yes, we're moving towards that.
[00:35:55.728 --> 00:35:57.508]  The dollar dropped a few points just that day.
[00:35:57.529 --> 00:35:59.109]  But don't worry.
[00:35:59.489 --> 00:36:00.629]  People get confused by this.
[00:36:00.649 --> 00:36:02.310]  They go, well, I see the euro going down.
[00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:03.950]  I see the yen or the yen going down.
[00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:06.151]  I see the dollar going down together.
[00:36:06.331 --> 00:36:07.611]  They're all going down.
[00:36:07.751 --> 00:36:08.792]  One will go down this month.
[00:36:08.852 --> 00:36:10.492]  The next month, this one goes down.
[00:36:10.532 --> 00:36:12.213]  And then one will go back up a little bit.
[00:36:12.253 --> 00:36:13.353]  And then the other one will go back up a little bit.
[00:36:13.373 --> 00:36:14.233]  Then it drops again.
[00:36:14.613 --> 00:36:16.374]  But overall, the graph is down.
[00:36:16.974 --> 00:36:17.074]  OK?
[00:36:18.442 --> 00:36:20.824]  And the globalists are operating in 25-year increments.
[00:36:22.145 --> 00:36:27.370]  We've been trained to operate in daily or weekly or monthly, maximum, hand-to-mouth.
[00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:32.854]  And so we're almost defenseless against this system until we realize it.
[00:36:33.174 --> 00:36:34.876]  We were talking to Erica in California.
[00:36:34.896 --> 00:36:41.582]  I wanted to have her finish up the story she was telling about her parents immigrating with her from Eastern Europe.
[00:36:42.523 --> 00:36:49.906]  And now she had family that was scooped up and never seen again by Stalin's NKVD and then others after Stalin, Khrushchev and others.
[00:36:49.926 --> 00:36:52.927]  And then we're going to go to other phone calls and get into some more news.
[00:36:52.968 --> 00:36:54.588]  But finish up your point, Erica.
[00:36:55.989 --> 00:37:05.293]  Well, I think I think the main point really is just, you know, the people that have my family sacrificed tremendous things to be able to be here in this country.
[00:37:05.393 --> 00:37:10.275]  I mean, we're talking literally escaping their homes with just the clothes on their backs and their kids in their arms.
[00:37:11.355 --> 00:37:24.018]  And, you know, the sacrifices they made to come here, the time it took, and then to, you know, I grew up with such an appreciation for what our country stood for and what, you know, this amazing holiday is coming up here.
[00:37:24.818 --> 00:37:27.999]  And it's just sad to me to see how people don't appreciate it.
[00:37:28.039 --> 00:37:38.221]  I think, you know, people have been in, you know, taken history class and they've learned sort of the basics, but, you know, I've learned firsthand from my family members really what went through their minds and what they endured.
[00:37:38.241 --> 00:37:39.621]  I mean, my dad to this day,
[00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:46.855]  You know, has nightmares and night terrors because, you know, he remembers bombs dropping around him and having to escape.
[00:37:46.955 --> 00:37:48.657]  And my mom was born in a bomb shelter.
[00:37:48.677 --> 00:37:53.160]  I mean, it was and there's tons of stories of people just like my family who have sacrificed to come here.
[00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:59.265]  And I think, you know, every Fourth of July, I mean, I believe people should retake the exam it takes to become a United States citizen.
[00:37:59.485 --> 00:38:04.189]  When I was a little girl, I watched my mom take that exam because she wanted to become a United States citizen.
[00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:09.151]  And she was learning all about our history and the Bill of Rights and what it means to be an American.
[00:38:09.231 --> 00:38:12.731]  And I believe everybody should revisit that as we get older.
[00:38:13.112 --> 00:38:14.112]  Absolutely, Erica.
[00:38:14.612 --> 00:38:17.392]  Erica, God bless you, and I'm glad you're a listener and keep spreading the word.
[00:38:17.532 --> 00:38:18.833]  And we will defend this republic.
[00:38:19.293 --> 00:38:20.893]  And that's what's so insulting about it.
[00:38:21.993 --> 00:38:25.734]  Is that Mexico lost several wars with the United States.
[00:38:25.974 --> 00:38:27.994]  Mexico believes the Southwest belongs to it.
[00:38:28.414 --> 00:38:30.395]  Mexico is a joke, failed state.
[00:38:30.915 --> 00:38:32.035]  Completely collapsed.
[00:38:33.479 --> 00:38:51.943]  And our government that's treacherous and treasonous, because it's bought off, there's been a corporate takeover, and the Mexican government teach in the schools, in the US and in Mexico, that America's bad and Mexico is good, and the media teaches Hispanics that come here to keep their culture for whatever country they came from, and to hate this country.
[00:38:52.543 --> 00:38:53.724]  Why would the government do that?
[00:38:53.784 --> 00:38:56.284]  Because the government is illegitimate, and I'm going to say it again.
[00:38:56.804 --> 00:38:58.625]  Globalism is treason.
[00:38:59.844 --> 00:39:02.786]  Globalism is a corporate takeover.
[00:39:03.227 --> 00:39:05.208]  We don't have to worry about Russian spies, folks.
[00:39:05.228 --> 00:39:07.110]  We don't have to worry about Muslim terrorists.
[00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:08.931]  I mean, some of that exists.
[00:39:09.552 --> 00:39:20.320]  But comparatively, when you compare that to Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, these mega-massive global institutions that are
[00:39:21.377 --> 00:39:28.424]  Openly selling trillions of derivatives to county and city and state governments, knowing it would implode, so they could then bankrupt them and take them over.
[00:39:28.865 --> 00:39:30.626]  Knowing they brought down whole nations.
[00:39:30.666 --> 00:39:34.410]  I mean, we have the IMF World Bank documents from 2002 where this was all admitted.
[00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:39.936]  I've been warning you about the derivative takeover since then, intensely telling you exactly what would happen.
[00:39:41.797 --> 00:39:44.000]  We don't toot our horn enough as patriots.
[00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:54.998]  and break down the fact that we have laid out this radio show over a decade ago and intensely for at least eight years exactly what would happen.
[00:39:56.459 --> 00:39:58.501]  I mean, go back and watch my old films.
[00:39:58.561 --> 00:40:01.524]  Go back and read my book written eight and a half years ago.
[00:40:02.284 --> 00:40:10.731]  Go back and listen to mp3 files of my radio show from fourteen years ago and video from my TV show fifteen years ago.
[00:40:10.851 --> 00:40:12.253]  Watch what I was talking about then
[00:40:13.467 --> 00:40:24.615]  Bullhorning the Capitol saying the banks are taking control of our currency and they're creating fiat currency and buying up all our infrastructure and they're selling toxic assets to governments.
[00:40:24.655 --> 00:40:32.801]  They're getting the stock market, you know, the government to invest in the stock market and they're planning to implode at a key time and they're planning to take over the United States.
[00:40:33.141 --> 00:40:34.962]  Now we're going to burn this UN flag.
[00:40:35.202 --> 00:40:36.023]  This is your enemy.
[00:40:38.012 --> 00:40:47.479]  I mean, there's videos of that from me 14 years ago, 15 years ago, not because I'm a genius, but because I read what these people have done in other countries.
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:48.100]  It's 100%.
[00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:52.383]  And I'm going to go back to your calls, but I want to briefly tell this story now.
[00:40:52.403 --> 00:40:54.765]  I was driving in this morning.
[00:40:55.981 --> 00:41:00.945]  And there was some traffic, so I was in the car about 35, 40 minutes, and I listened to talk radio.
[00:41:01.686 --> 00:41:05.309]  Local, national, San Antonio, Dallas, Houston.
[00:41:06.029 --> 00:41:11.654]  I just have a practice of tuning through and listening about two, three minutes to maybe 10 stations.
[00:41:14.116 --> 00:41:17.198]  And it was, what are you gonna barbecue this 4th of July?
[00:41:18.539 --> 00:41:19.961]  Obama's a commie.
[00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:23.321]  The Russian spies are going to get us.
[00:41:25.061 --> 00:41:26.301]  The oil spill.
[00:41:27.962 --> 00:41:31.083]  On and on and on with really distractions.
[00:41:31.783 --> 00:41:39.885]  And I heard people calling in on two different shows on two different stations about what they're going to barbecue this 4th of July.
[00:41:40.605 --> 00:41:42.726]  And I talked to even friends and family and
[00:41:44.431 --> 00:41:46.832]  I'll say, you know, the dollar's continuing to plunge.
[00:41:46.873 --> 00:41:50.495]  You know they're devaluing all the currencies together so people don't notice as much.
[00:41:50.535 --> 00:41:53.016]  You know they are getting ready for an attack on Iran.
[00:41:53.036 --> 00:42:00.301]  I mean, that's in the news today with all these government ministers and the G8 and others saying, yes, we're getting ready to hit Iran.
[00:42:00.341 --> 00:42:01.782]  The Bilderberg's giving the green light.
[00:42:03.743 --> 00:42:10.107]  And people are just, well, so what?
[00:42:12.108 --> 00:42:18.412]  There's almost just like a completely passive attitude towards this, where folks just put up with it.
[00:42:21.654 --> 00:42:28.037]  Ladies and gentlemen, when populations let governments run wild, the very worst people in society will take over.
[00:42:28.397 --> 00:42:31.799]  And you will get a World War I. You will get a World War II.
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.640]  But a 21st century version.
[00:42:34.861 --> 00:42:36.222]  You will get knocks on the door.
[00:42:36.282 --> 00:42:37.423]  You will be drug away.
[00:42:38.023 --> 00:42:39.664]  I mean, that is what they're setting up.
[00:42:39.784 --> 00:42:40.965]  It's guaranteed.
[00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:42.930]  They want that.
[00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:46.352]  They want that savage, psychopathic power turned loose.
[00:42:47.933 --> 00:42:53.915]  And they've militarized the police and brainwashed them that it's macho and cool to attack the public.
[00:42:54.216 --> 00:42:55.156]  And we're in trouble.
[00:42:57.597 --> 00:42:59.698]  And just on this 4th of July, realize that.
[00:43:00.759 --> 00:43:02.739]  That what America is, is dead.
[00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:10.163]  We may be able to resuscitate it, but that's going to take every one of you screaming bloody murder and really getting aggressive.
[00:43:11.209 --> 00:43:12.550]  The globalists are scared right now.
[00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:14.531]  They're reaching for the whole world.
[00:43:14.931 --> 00:43:15.951]  They've miscalculated.
[00:43:16.231 --> 00:43:17.212]  They know they're in trouble.
[00:43:17.252 --> 00:43:20.173]  That's why they've said they're in trouble, and that they've got to accelerate their program.
[00:43:20.693 --> 00:43:22.454]  So we forced them off their time frame.
[00:43:22.834 --> 00:43:24.375]  We forced them to come out in the open.
[00:43:25.095 --> 00:43:27.797]  And so we're in the fight, but this is a fight of our lives.
[00:43:29.097 --> 00:43:32.019]  All right, I want to go to George, Mark, Derry, Chris, Kyle.
[00:43:32.039 --> 00:43:33.199]  We're going to get to all of you quickly.
[00:43:33.239 --> 00:43:34.500]  George in Texas, thanks for holding.
[00:43:35.216 --> 00:43:36.517]  Thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[00:43:37.077 --> 00:43:37.477]  Thank you.
[00:43:38.278 --> 00:43:42.520]  Yes, I'm going to, when I think about the Support July, I'm going to celebrate freedom of speech.
[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:46.943]  I'm going to go to the fireworks event and read the Declaration of Independence out loud.
[00:43:47.623 --> 00:43:51.566]  And make sure when people go through seatbelt checkpoints, they know what I'm talking about.
[00:43:54.718 --> 00:43:55.939]  Well, that's important to do.
[00:43:55.999 --> 00:44:02.787]  In fact, later in the broadcast, I'm going to read some passages from the Declaration of Independence when Bob Chapman is on with us.
[00:44:02.867 --> 00:44:05.290]  And if you read that, that is sedition.
[00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:08.934]  That is terrorism, according to FEMA and Homeland Security today.
[00:44:10.155 --> 00:44:20.881]  And that's why I have FEMA on tape to police and firemen and medical people in Kansas City, pre-911, demonizing the Founding Fathers and the Declaration of Independence.
[00:44:21.322 --> 00:44:23.183]  Because that is a terrorist document.
[00:44:23.463 --> 00:44:24.163]  Too terrorist.
[00:44:24.744 --> 00:44:25.564]  George, anything else?
[00:44:26.264 --> 00:44:33.949]  Well, yeah, I mean, even on my website I posted, um, why we should remember the 4th of July, just hoping, because I'm celebrating my freedom of speech.
[00:44:34.594 --> 00:44:35.595]  I appreciate your call.
[00:44:35.635 --> 00:44:39.718]  But the silver lining in all of this is at the end of the day,
[00:44:51.445 --> 00:44:53.486]  People are going to know why freedom's special.
[00:44:53.846 --> 00:44:56.367]  They're going to know why we celebrate the 4th.
[00:44:57.208 --> 00:44:59.689]  A lot of people are already discovering that.
[00:45:00.069 --> 00:45:05.892]  But as the tyranny gets worse, people are now going to rediscover why freedom is the key to everything.
[00:45:06.292 --> 00:45:07.993]  Freedom is the engine of happiness.
[00:45:08.073 --> 00:45:09.114]  It is the engine of wealth.
[00:45:09.494 --> 00:45:12.395]  It is the engine of honor and independence and strength.
[00:45:14.276 --> 00:45:18.098]  Let's go to Derry, listening in Tennessee on 1470 AM.
[00:45:18.678 --> 00:45:19.599]  Derry, you're on the air.
[00:45:19.639 --> 00:45:19.959]  Welcome.
[00:45:21.049 --> 00:45:22.469]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:45:22.509 --> 00:45:22.910]  Good, sir.
[00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:23.250]  Welcome.
[00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:25.030]  Thank you very much.
[00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:30.832]  I just have one word for America right now, and it's hope.
[00:45:32.612 --> 00:45:36.813]  For many years, I was a Republican.
[00:45:37.954 --> 00:45:46.716]  I started voting under Ronald Reagan, and then when Bob Dole got elected, or when they nominated Bob Dole, I quit voting, because I knew something was wrong.
[00:45:46.736 --> 00:45:47.757]  Yeah, they ran a corpse.
[00:45:47.797 --> 00:45:49.117]  They ran a corpse against Clinton.
[00:45:50.131 --> 00:45:51.051]  Yeah, evidently.
[00:45:51.371 --> 00:45:57.993]  But the other day I was in the flea market and there was two people that were arguing about abortion.
[00:45:58.153 --> 00:46:00.734]  And they turned to me and they said, what do you think?
[00:46:00.794 --> 00:46:06.635]  And I said, well, to be quite frank with you, I don't think that it's a Supreme Court issue.
[00:46:06.695 --> 00:46:08.436]  And they looked at me and said, why?
[00:46:08.816 --> 00:46:10.777]  And I said, I think it's a state's issue.
[00:46:10.857 --> 00:46:14.177]  And if a state wants to vote that way, hey, try to vote it out.
[00:46:14.278 --> 00:46:15.998]  I said, I don't think it's a federal issue.
[00:46:16.451 --> 00:46:20.536]  This lady came up to me and she said, Hey, uh, I have something to give you.
[00:46:21.016 --> 00:46:22.278]  And I said, well, what is it?
[00:46:22.298 --> 00:46:24.981]  And she goes, um, it's a tape, a CD.
[00:46:25.381 --> 00:46:28.224]  And she handed it to me and it said, don't tread on me.
[00:46:28.965 --> 00:46:30.927]  And, uh, she goes, will you listen to it?
[00:46:31.107 --> 00:46:32.549]  And I said, well, yeah, I will.
[00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:35.352]  And she goes, have you ever heard of Alex Jones?
[00:46:36.073 --> 00:46:37.935]  And I said, no, no, I haven't.
[00:46:38.656 --> 00:46:42.259]  And, uh, she goes, uh, well, just play this tape and tell me what you think.
[00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:45.562]  I'll tell you what, stay there, stay there, uh, Derry.
[00:46:45.603 --> 00:46:53.470]  Come back and finish your point, because absolutely, as we educate each other, you've got info I need, I've got info you need.
[00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:57.073]  We all raise our level of awareness together.
[00:46:57.213 --> 00:46:57.774]  We'll be back.
[00:46:58.852 --> 00:47:06.780]  For years you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.

[00:48:57.782 --> 00:49:00.504]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[00:49:00.724 --> 00:49:04.686]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[00:49:04.886 --> 00:49:06.967]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[00:49:07.167 --> 00:49:12.190]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[00:49:12.330 --> 00:49:14.091]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[00:49:14.151 --> 00:49:15.492]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[00:49:15.692 --> 00:49:17.133]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[00:49:17.173 --> 00:49:20.215]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[00:49:20.535 --> 00:49:25.580]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[00:49:25.921 --> 00:49:35.050]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[00:49:35.271 --> 00:49:37.573]  The book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:49:40.416 --> 00:49:43.737]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.
[00:49:43.897 --> 00:49:48.238]  Discover how gold may be right for you and your IRA by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:49:50.459 --> 00:49:53.600]  Whether buying or it's time for you to sell, the book is free.
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:56.681]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:49:57.241 --> 00:49:59.322]  You worry, but only because you're paying attention.
[00:49:59.762 --> 00:50:02.823]  What's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature.
[00:50:03.323 --> 00:50:11.304]  A similar audacity called GMO, or genetically modified organisms, means that the quality of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health in the balance.
[00:50:11.805 --> 00:50:16.725]  Now that summer's here, what better time to learn about the bounty that nature provides in wild edible food?
[00:50:17.286 --> 00:50:22.406]  Let author Linda Runyon show you the best-kept secret in plain sight that food is everywhere you look.
[00:50:22.907 --> 00:50:30.408]  This summer, for the cost of a good meal or two out, you can literally starvation-proof yourself and your loved ones against any future craziness, and put up tons of free food too.
[00:50:30.948 --> 00:50:35.952]  Whatever experiment is being run on us, you can rest assured that Linda's 50 or so staple foods aren't involved.
[00:50:36.392 --> 00:50:37.673]  Our foods are their enemy.
[00:50:38.233 --> 00:50:43.697]  So go to ofthefield.com or call toll-free 1-888-51-EAT-FREE and take that first step.
[00:50:44.078 --> 00:50:46.740]  Make your oasis of food security and nutrition now.
[00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:50.322]  That's O-F-T-H-E-F-I-E-L-D dot com or call 1-888-513-2837.
[00:50:50.342 --> 00:50:51.803]  Start now and make 2010 your year of independence.
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:04.662]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:51:05.342 --> 00:51:07.683]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:51:09.063 --> 00:51:11.144]  I want to play a few minutes of Pete Stark.
[00:51:11.164 --> 00:51:14.865]  This has been out for a couple days on InfoWars.com as California Congressman.
[00:51:15.466 --> 00:51:21.888]  And the unbelievable arrogance by people at a town hall who just want to control our borders.
[00:51:22.847 --> 00:51:28.670]  I mean, if you're a citizen, you got a crooked toenail, they throw a book at you, but America is starting to collapse on the Southwest.
[00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:32.732]  46 states are on the verge of bankruptcy, according to Bloomberg.
[00:51:34.293 --> 00:51:40.276]  People are coming in having babies for free, everything paid for, citizens, everything's disintegrating.
[00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:44.382]  And he just says, oh, you want to kill somebody.
[00:51:44.422 --> 00:51:45.303]  You're a Minuteman.
[00:51:45.563 --> 00:51:46.704]  Minutemen haven't killed anybody.
[00:51:46.764 --> 00:51:50.046]  It's just all arrogance out of these people.
[00:51:50.827 --> 00:51:59.433]  This is the face of incumbency, but I wanted to have Kyle in... No, Derry in Tennessee listening to 1470 AM finish up.
[00:52:00.054 --> 00:52:00.835]  So finish up your point.
[00:52:00.875 --> 00:52:07.860]  This lady gave you a copy of Don't Tread on Me, a documentary we sell that I'm in on Infowars.com, and continue.
[00:52:09.164 --> 00:52:14.668]  Well, anyhow, so she gave me the copy, and she said, now promise me that you'll listen to it.
[00:52:14.828 --> 00:52:15.769]  And I said, I promise.
[00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:19.792]  And so I went home, and me and my son put it on, and we started watching it.
[00:52:20.273 --> 00:52:21.274]  And it was amazing.
[00:52:21.374 --> 00:52:26.197]  It was filled with all the things that you need to know about the Constitution.
[00:52:26.938 --> 00:52:31.121]  And I listened to CNN, I listened to Fox, I read newspapers.
[00:52:31.181 --> 00:52:38.307]  I try to keep up with everything, even though I quit voting because it was just based on lies.
[00:52:38.871 --> 00:52:40.552]  But you know something, Alex?
[00:52:41.072 --> 00:52:55.842]  In your life, when you hear important things, you know, about Christ for the first time, about what America was formed on, and when I heard your words, you know they're true in your heart.
[00:52:56.423 --> 00:53:02.987]  And something comes over you, and you know that the person that is speaking the words is the truth.
[00:53:03.847 --> 00:53:04.688]  It's real.
[00:53:05.208 --> 00:53:06.029]  And when I heard it,
[00:53:06.548 --> 00:53:12.670]  I knew it was real, and then everything started clicking in and started making sense in my mind.
[00:53:13.110 --> 00:53:16.712]  And then I have followed you religiously, your show now, for a month.
[00:53:17.472 --> 00:53:21.793]  And I've listened to the finance, and it makes sense what they're doing.
[00:53:21.813 --> 00:53:28.155]  You know, the world has been jealous of America because we have supported Israel, and God blessed us for it.
[00:53:28.876 --> 00:53:32.577]  And all the different things that you're saying are making sense.
[00:53:33.041 --> 00:53:38.164]  No, I don't believe in everything, but I'm sure that you don't believe in everything that someone else says.
[00:53:38.705 --> 00:53:44.188]  But so much that you say, 99% of it, you can tell in your heart.
[00:53:44.589 --> 00:53:48.371]  And that's why this movement, Alex, is growing.
[00:53:48.871 --> 00:53:55.316]  And you can't stop the truth, because the news media, the politicians, whatever, try to brainwash us.
[00:53:55.396 --> 00:53:58.338]  Oh, those are conspiracy nuts, and whatever.
[00:53:58.358 --> 00:54:01.760]  But what happens is, once you listen to it,
[00:54:02.728 --> 00:54:09.149]  Their lives fall and you know in your heart it's revealed to you that that's the truth.
[00:54:09.389 --> 00:54:13.030]  God is speaking to you in your heart and you'll say what you say.
[00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:13.510]  I know.
[00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:28.233]  And that's why the system wants to start wars and economic collapses and why they want to keep that oil well leaking and block the ships from scooping up the oil so that the hurricanes can come in and drive it into land because they are in such desperate straits.
[00:54:28.493 --> 00:54:35.323]  All of their credibility is imploding so bad that they need huge distractions to divert the public.
[00:54:35.363 --> 00:54:43.835]  But I was just about to say before you said those eloquent words, and true words, that people are coming together.
[00:54:44.958 --> 00:54:53.845]  And people know the truth when they hear it, because subconsciously, our minds are much more powerful than our conscious mind.
[00:54:54.745 --> 00:54:56.887]  And of course, it's also in the spirit as well, the discernment.
[00:54:57.567 --> 00:54:59.489]  And that's why the system hates me so much.
[00:54:59.609 --> 00:55:01.770]  I'm not perfect, but I really try to tell the truth.
[00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:03.471]  I really try to get at the truth.
[00:55:03.552 --> 00:55:05.813]  I really try to do the best job I can.
[00:55:05.833 --> 00:55:06.514]  I make mistakes.
[00:55:07.034 --> 00:55:07.755]  But that's the difference.
[00:55:07.855 --> 00:55:09.357]  I'm trying to tell the truth.
[00:55:09.757 --> 00:55:11.018]  I'm trying to love God.
[00:55:11.058 --> 00:55:12.400]  I'm trying to be a good person.
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:14.182]  I'm trying to be pure.
[00:55:14.522 --> 00:55:17.625]  I'm trying to turn myself over to God to be a vessel of goodness.
[00:55:17.926 --> 00:55:22.631]  Doesn't mean I'm not worldly and, you know, the weakness of the flesh and the thorn in the side and all the rest of it.
[00:55:23.752 --> 00:55:23.972]  But...
[00:55:24.813 --> 00:55:28.236]  At the end of the day, we are making the right choice.
[00:55:28.356 --> 00:55:37.423]  Our hearts are right, and so we're one group, and those that love evil and love lies and love tyranny, and just that's what their spirit is inclined to.
[00:55:37.844 --> 00:55:39.285]  That's what their psyche is inclined to.
[00:55:39.365 --> 00:55:40.526]  That is what they've chosen.
[00:55:40.946 --> 00:55:50.073]  But most people love God and deep down are good, and they don't like the evil that's part of the human psyche, and they want to be good people.
[00:55:50.113 --> 00:55:51.395]  They want to have a good future.
[00:55:51.435 --> 00:55:54.277]  They want the blessings that come with doing the right thing.
[00:55:54.557 --> 00:55:56.218]  But freedom has to be fought for.
[00:55:56.898 --> 00:55:59.979]  And we're at a great crossroads right now.
[00:56:00.839 --> 00:56:04.981]  And we are going into bondage, just like Israel went into bondage every time they became evil.
[00:56:05.341 --> 00:56:08.362]  God turned them over to bondage and to foreign occupation.
[00:56:08.662 --> 00:56:11.303]  And we're occupied by offshore global corporate interest.
[00:56:12.163 --> 00:56:14.264]  And globalism is treason.
[00:56:14.424 --> 00:56:15.705]  It is the overthrow of our nation.
[00:56:16.185 --> 00:56:18.927]  Not by a country, but by a corporate Borg.
[00:56:19.607 --> 00:56:21.488]  And we are now discovering that.
[00:56:22.109 --> 00:56:26.951]  And the system is panicking because they know that we know they're a pack of crooks.
[00:56:27.392 --> 00:56:28.212]  God bless you, sir.
[00:56:28.452 --> 00:56:29.833]  Go out and wake others up now.
[00:56:30.293 --> 00:56:31.634]  And continue to move forward.
[00:56:32.074 --> 00:56:33.455]  We will save the Republic.
[00:56:33.735 --> 00:56:35.656]  We will get that reprieve like Nineveh.
[00:56:36.296 --> 00:56:38.658]  If we trust in God and take action.
[00:56:39.178 --> 00:56:44.281]  We'll be back with Max Keiser, Warrior Calls, and I will get to that clip of this treacherous little congressman.
[00:56:44.581 --> 00:56:46.022]  Infowars.com's the website.
[00:56:46.282 --> 00:56:46.722]  Stay with us.
[00:56:48.823 --> 00:56:49.704]  We're on the march.
[00:56:50.224 --> 00:56:51.825]  The empire's on the run.
[00:56:52.725 --> 00:56:55.427]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:01.421]  You're subject to public police action.
[00:57:02.302 --> 00:57:03.223]  Tyranny is here.
[00:57:03.564 --> 00:57:07.467]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:57:07.488 --> 00:57:09.710]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:15.175]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:57:15.596 --> 00:57:21.822]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:57:22.242 --> 00:57:27.804]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:57:28.225 --> 00:57:31.906]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:57:32.406 --> 00:57:36.388]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:57:36.688 --> 00:57:42.210]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:45.612]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:57:46.192 --> 00:57:47.632]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:57:48.173 --> 00:57:48.593]  It's here.

[00:57:58.561 --> 00:58:01.163]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:58:01.563 --> 00:58:06.526]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:58:06.906 --> 00:58:08.627]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:58:08.947 --> 00:58:13.770]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:14.911]  How much do you want?
[00:58:15.131 --> 00:58:15.871]  When do you want it?
[00:58:16.251 --> 00:58:17.852]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:58:18.153 --> 00:58:18.973]  When will you need it?
[00:58:19.213 --> 00:58:21.274]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:58:21.415 --> 00:58:22.515]  Will there be any food?
[00:58:22.755 --> 00:58:23.876]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:58:24.276 --> 00:58:29.342]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:58:29.542 --> 00:58:32.726]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:58:33.126 --> 00:58:36.630]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:37.931]  How much will you need?
[00:58:38.172 --> 00:58:38.792]  We don't know.
[00:58:39.093 --> 00:58:39.994]  How much do you want?
[00:58:40.194 --> 00:58:40.915]  All you can get.
[00:58:40.935 --> 00:58:41.916]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:58:42.196 --> 00:58:44.960]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:47.444]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:58:47.484 --> 00:58:48.465]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:58:58.837 --> 00:59:04.582]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[00:59:05.283 --> 00:59:09.727]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.
[00:59:10.548 --> 00:59:24.100]  Featuring Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Joseph Farah, David Icke, Naomi Wolf, G. Edward Griffin, Doug McIntyre, Mark Crispin Miller, Mickey Z, Doug Casey, David McElhaney, and myself, Alex Jones.
[00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:29.304]  Protect yourself and get the tools you need to protect your family from these difficult times.
[00:59:29.884 --> 00:59:39.510]  The Fall of America and the Western World at www.thefallofamerica.net or click on the banners at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[00:59:40.110 --> 00:59:45.253]  Again, that website's www.thefallofamerica.net or call 800-655-1577.
[00:59:45.273 --> 00:59:47.474]  Prepare yourself and the ones you love today.
[00:59:47.534 --> 00:59:48.075]  fallofamerica.net
[01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:16.057]  All right, Max Keiser, who of course has a television program on BBC, RT, Press TV, British Radio Show, Blog.
[01:00:17.779 --> 01:00:38.248]  Max Keiser will be joining us for about 15-20 minutes here in just a moment to talk about the fact that we've always known in the last 20 years they're going to set up a global government, have a new cashless society, we'll still have regional currencies but they'll be denominated and controlled by that new central bank currency, a private banking cartel openly establishing world government.
[01:00:38.508 --> 01:00:41.009]  But now it's been admitted and it's big news.
[01:00:41.469 --> 01:00:42.350]  Our story about it
[01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:48.574]  from the UN report that we gleaned it from is one of the top stories on the Drudge Report right now.
[01:00:48.594 --> 01:00:51.957]  We appreciate Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com for that.
[01:00:52.017 --> 01:00:58.181]  We're now getting two or three top links a week and we just tip our hat to the courage of Matt Drudge.
[01:00:59.002 --> 01:01:06.968]  Very, very exciting how mainstream this information is becoming, but you know, Drudge realizes that we've been on record for 15 years laying all this out and
[01:01:07.688 --> 01:01:09.392]  We now have more credibility than ever.
[01:01:09.773 --> 01:01:12.741]  So does Max Keiser, Gerald Cilente, and others that we routinely interview.
[01:01:12.981 --> 01:01:15.127]  We're going to Max Keiser here in just a moment.
[01:01:15.427 --> 01:01:16.570]  But before I go any further...
[01:01:17.475 --> 01:01:20.116]  We'll tell you about MySolarBackup.com.
[01:01:20.136 --> 01:01:21.977]  That's one word, MySolarBackup.com.
[01:01:22.537 --> 01:01:26.179]  Have you lost your power and simply wanted to simply flip the switch to get the lights back on?
[01:01:26.219 --> 01:01:33.283]  If so, you should check out MySolarBackup.com because there's never been a better time to start getting off the grid and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[01:01:33.303 --> 01:01:35.584]  You can run a little work shed or your garage.
[01:01:35.624 --> 01:01:36.464]  It's great for camping.
[01:01:36.804 --> 01:01:39.446]  Get several of the units, run your old house.
[01:01:40.226 --> 01:01:48.676]  It's great during brownouts, ice storms, hurricanes, or if you just want to stop paying, you know, the sickening carbon taxes that they're starting to levy on top of our electricity.
[01:01:49.895 --> 01:01:53.498]  New Zealand just passed it and their energy prices went up by 5% in two days.
[01:01:54.139 --> 01:01:55.440]  And it's asked me to go up 20%.
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:02:00.985]  The point is, the global stinkers don't own the sun yet, so start moving off the grid today.
[01:02:01.625 --> 01:02:03.767]  Give them a call, 877-327-0365 to get a free information package or order.
[01:02:03.787 --> 01:02:04.188]  877-327-0365 or MySolarBackup.
[01:02:10.373 --> 01:02:11.393]  Uh, dot com.
[01:02:11.994 --> 01:02:13.614]  And of course, a wonderful sponsor.
[01:02:13.634 --> 01:02:15.415]  It's not enough to just filter the water you drink.
[01:02:15.915 --> 01:02:22.417]  It's that you bathe in the sodium fluoride and the mercury and the lead and the other Grignard reagents that they dump directly into the water.
[01:02:22.437 --> 01:02:25.178]  That's where they get rid of the toxic waste from.
[01:02:28.755 --> 01:02:29.696]  Aluminum production.
[01:02:30.596 --> 01:02:32.998]  So I want to tell you about PureWaterFreedom.com.
[01:02:33.418 --> 01:02:36.440]  They have whole house filters, great in-house filters.
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:40.422]  They have them for your water, for your bathtub, your shower, your washing machines.
[01:02:40.622 --> 01:02:43.564]  They have it all, from the inexpensive to the grand.
[01:02:44.025 --> 01:02:46.366]  It's all there at PureWaterFreedom.com.
[01:02:46.746 --> 01:02:53.430]  PureWaterFreedom.com, they're patriots, and most importantly, it's all made in the United States of America while it's still here.
[01:02:53.851 --> 01:02:54.991]  PureWaterFreedom.com.
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:03.045]  If you love America and love our industry, what's left of it, the skeleton that's left, you better start supporting American companies.
[01:03:03.085 --> 01:03:04.105]  Purewaterfreedom.com.
[01:03:04.666 --> 01:03:11.110]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, let us now go to the one, the only, Max Keiser.
[01:03:11.511 --> 01:03:13.992]  He, of course, is the inventor of the Hollywood Stock Exchange System.
[01:03:14.853 --> 01:03:23.880]  He, of course, also is a retired former top broker, and he is a TV host and columnist, and he joins us because I thought
[01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:31.822]  In the last few days, we've got to get Kaiser on to give us his take on dollar plunges after UN call to ditch the greenback.
[01:03:32.142 --> 01:03:34.863]  That's what AP, Reuters, CNN all said.
[01:03:34.923 --> 01:03:43.066]  The answer to the depression, they're now admitting it's going to be a depression, been in one for two years, is we'll give the very banks that sold us tens of trillions in derivatives
[01:03:43.726 --> 01:03:46.068]  And are above the law and won't tell Congress where the money is.
[01:03:46.389 --> 01:03:53.996]  We'll let them have a global government we pay taxes to, Max, and then all our currencies will be denominated and they'll be able to manipulate things even more.
[01:03:54.056 --> 01:04:02.184]  So I thought we'd get you on as a former insider who really understands how this works to talk about this new system.
[01:04:02.564 --> 01:04:03.886]  Break it down for us, Max Keiser.
[01:04:05.205 --> 01:04:29.947]  Well, it should be no secret to the people listening to your show, and the guests that you have brought on to your show have made this point over the past few years, and the issuance of a new global currency is really a fait accompli, because the need for all the banks to re-securitize and re-package all that bad debt
[01:04:30.935 --> 01:04:37.898]  And put it into some new entity, some new global bank, as a way to... two benefits to this.
[01:04:37.938 --> 01:04:42.320]  Number one, all the bankers get another fee for having repackaged all the bad debt.
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:52.944]  And number two, they get to push the liability when, you know, the day of reckoning down the road, hopefully a few months or a year or two.
[01:04:53.924 --> 01:04:55.385]  But they're willing to sacrifice.
[01:04:56.292 --> 01:05:02.515]  America's sovereignty as an independent nation to get this goal accomplished.
[01:05:02.635 --> 01:05:14.261]  And this is a huge problem because you've got the banks on Wall Street who are acting in ways that are not consistent with what's in the interest of all Americans from coast to coast.
[01:05:14.301 --> 01:05:17.262]  They're acting at cross-purposes to America.
[01:05:17.282 --> 01:05:20.023]  Now let me point your direction to something on Bloomberg.
[01:05:20.063 --> 01:05:20.463]  July 1,
[01:05:22.447 --> 01:05:40.035]  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and New York Fed Timothy Geithner told Senators on April 3rd of 2008 that the tens of billions of dollars in assets the government agreed to purchase in the rescue of Bear Stearns were quote investment grade.
[01:05:41.101 --> 01:05:49.846]  What we just discovered today, or the last couple of days, is what these things that they put on the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve were not investment grade.
[01:05:50.346 --> 01:05:51.427]  They were not even junk.
[01:05:51.987 --> 01:05:54.269]  They were pure trash.
[01:05:54.429 --> 01:05:55.849]  Pure garbage.
[01:05:56.310 --> 01:06:01.953]  They gave the Federal Reserve Bank, which is essentially at this point the People's Bank,
[01:06:02.313 --> 01:06:12.080]  Pure garbage in exchange for treasury bills that they used to pay themselves those huge bonuses in 2008 and 2009 and 2010.
[01:06:12.361 --> 01:06:15.723]  It's an act of pure, you know, it's illegal.
[01:06:16.824 --> 01:06:17.805]  Of course it's illegal.
[01:06:18.605 --> 01:06:25.590]  You're not allowed, the Federal Reserve is not allowed to make loans, unsecured loans, and when the banks gave them
[01:06:26.571 --> 01:06:27.713]  ...paper that was worthless.
[01:06:27.733 --> 01:06:31.437]  It had no value whatsoever.
[01:06:32.058 --> 01:06:37.805]  They just had a notation on a piece of paper saying something like, what do they call it?
[01:06:38.105 --> 01:06:39.067]  Here's what they called it.
[01:06:39.087 --> 01:06:42.391]  They called it HG-COL Limited.
[01:06:43.456 --> 01:06:45.397]  That's all it said on a piece of paper.
[01:06:45.557 --> 01:06:47.998]  For that, the Federal Reserve gave them 10, 20, 30 billion dollars.
[01:06:48.038 --> 01:07:01.103]  This is just total, total bank robbing and now Bloomberg comes out and the government admits that all the major big Federal Reserve holding banks, you know, the big six, are knee-deep in hundreds of billions of narcotics money, knowingly.
[01:07:01.123 --> 01:07:03.844]  Now that's not news to us, but this is now admitted.
[01:07:04.404 --> 01:07:25.218]  And they're also coming out and admitting that it's 600 trillion in derivatives in the Washington Post and that the financial re-regulation package actually gives the Federal Reserve total control over all the other banks so they can rob real local banks and credit unions and so they can also take control of any institution that affects the economy.
[01:07:25.458 --> 01:07:27.840]  So we're seeing a total banking dictatorship.
[01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:32.003]  It's like you robbed everyone and make Madoff look like a saint.
[01:07:32.283 --> 01:07:34.064]  We're going to give you godlike power.
[01:07:36.245 --> 01:07:41.707]  Well, I'll tell you what's going on in France, and this will give something that you haven't heard from anybody else.
[01:07:41.747 --> 01:07:43.568]  This is something happening right here in France.
[01:07:44.029 --> 01:07:53.573]  The French government, of course, is trying to get rid of Goldman Sachs, as are other governments in Europe, because they have anti-terrorist laws, and these banks are acting as terrorists.
[01:07:54.233 --> 01:08:02.137]  So what they're doing is they're introducing new laws, and they're trying to get rid of Goldman Sachs by introducing new financial obscenity laws.
[01:08:02.817 --> 01:08:11.779]  So in other words, instead of trying to legally build a case that Goldman Sachs should leave the country because they're breaking the law, it doesn't seem that's enough, you know?
[01:08:11.839 --> 01:08:13.860]  The public doesn't seem to mind that they're breaking the law.
[01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:22.482]  The fact that they're committing acts of moral outrage, again, the public doesn't seem really concerned that the bank is committing acts of moral outrage.
[01:08:22.702 --> 01:08:31.264]  So in the French courts right now, they're trying to introduce a new concept called financial obscenity, where they equate the actions of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan to kiddie porn.
[01:08:31.744 --> 01:08:34.285]  And they say, these guys are kiddie pornographers.
[01:08:34.685 --> 01:08:37.566]  In a sense, they're financial pornographers.
[01:08:37.866 --> 01:08:43.208]  And the reason that they're going down this path is they made the observation that in America, two things are quite sacred.
[01:08:43.488 --> 01:08:45.768]  Freedom of speech and private property.
[01:08:46.109 --> 01:08:55.311]  And they noticed that on the freedom of speech route, the way that a lot of these corporations are able to bypass the freedom of speech laws were to make things obscene.
[01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:57.412]  So they said, well, for example, they're trying to
[01:08:57.432 --> 01:09:01.594]  Shut down the internet because they are trying to protect you from quote-unquote obscenity.
[01:09:01.914 --> 01:09:04.335]  So the anti-obscenity laws are very, very powerful.
[01:09:04.616 --> 01:09:17.562]  So in the French government right now, what they're trying to do is to make a case for financial obscenity, saying Lloyd Blankfein is the equivalent of a kiddie pornographer, and that he should go to jail as such.
[01:09:18.002 --> 01:09:19.323]  And so this is a new concept.
[01:09:19.383 --> 01:09:21.483]  Well, Max, I want to talk more about that.
[01:09:43.208 --> 01:10:00.492]  I mean, I want to talk more about that, and this is profound what you're talking about, but you're influential on the continent of Europe, you're influential here in the U.S., but very influential all over the biggest TV and radio stations there, national French TV, national Greek TV, and so you are having a big effect.
[01:10:01.212 --> 01:10:11.995]  I would have you recommend that people go after the central bankers this way, because this is the most profound information I have
[01:10:13.359 --> 01:10:15.021]  To basically give to the public.
[01:10:15.242 --> 01:10:16.804]  And it's something that's hidden in plain view.
[01:10:17.124 --> 01:10:17.865]  You've talked about it.
[01:10:17.945 --> 01:10:18.646]  I've talked about it.
[01:10:18.927 --> 01:10:20.068]  But I want us to take a deep breath.
[01:10:21.255 --> 01:10:34.818]  In this spectrum of obscenity and corruption and just stuff that's so off-the-chart criminal, you know, banking heads saying, we won't tell you where trillions of taxpayer money went, we're just not going to tell you, and the congressmen are so castrated they say, yes sir.
[01:10:35.118 --> 01:10:40.240]  I mean, this is a level of just absurdity that it's almost like a spell we're under.
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:42.260]  But let me break the spell this way.
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:44.841]  The way to go after these banks is this way.
[01:10:45.641 --> 01:10:49.542]  They are basically foreign, private, corporate,
[01:10:50.362 --> 01:10:54.065]  international pirates, bigger financially than any one government in the world.
[01:10:54.505 --> 01:11:00.130]  They've created tens of trillions, well really thousands of trillions, in fiat toxic weaponry.
[01:11:00.791 --> 01:11:08.237]  And we're worried about 11 Russian spies who tried to infiltrate Harvard and Wall Street because that's who's hijacked America.
[01:11:08.417 --> 01:11:13.381]  You don't infiltrate Congress, you don't infiltrate the State Department, because they're just little political whores that follow orders.
[01:11:13.641 --> 01:11:15.683]  You infiltrate the Ivy League crooks.
[01:11:16.103 --> 01:11:17.824]  So yes, those are Russian spies, obviously.
[01:11:17.864 --> 01:11:19.886]  But the point is, they didn't infiltrate the government,
[01:11:20.026 --> 01:11:20.927]  Because we don't have a government.
[01:11:21.307 --> 01:11:22.908]  And I want this to really boil in.
[01:11:23.348 --> 01:11:31.494]  Globalism is the international lawlessness of these globalists, legalized by them.
[01:11:31.514 --> 01:11:40.340]  And so what they are is foreign espionage, corporate takeover spies, and they should all be arrested for sedition and for espionage.
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:45.525]  trying to overthrow our countries and hand our money supplies over to their new global government.
[01:11:45.746 --> 01:11:50.711]  I mean, it's so elementary, it's so hidden in plain view, that's how you go after them.
[01:11:50.951 --> 01:11:52.212]  This is espionage.
[01:11:52.493 --> 01:11:56.817]  They have come in and taken over our governments, and they have taken over the Greece government.
[01:11:57.518 --> 01:12:06.284]  They've taken over the Spanish government, and they're not gonna give us quarter, and they're a bunch of arrogant, uh, uh, Eddie Haskell bastards, and it's either us or them.
[01:12:06.524 --> 01:12:14.489]  Now, now, Max, what about that mindset, really beating the drum, that this is a corporate hostile takeover, and it is espionage?
[01:12:14.729 --> 01:12:16.591]  It is financial terrorism.
[01:12:16.811 --> 01:12:18.432]  As you've said, we're being conquered.
[01:12:19.817 --> 01:12:23.080]  I don't think it's a bad route to take.
[01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:26.502]  I would add also the idea of racketeering.
[01:12:27.242 --> 01:12:31.465]  You know, that's one thing sorely missing from the prosecution of these guys.
[01:12:31.746 --> 01:12:38.190]  Because the rating agencies, the investment banks, and the fund managers, and the banks on Wall Street are colluding.
[01:12:38.230 --> 01:12:39.131]  They have a racket.
[01:12:39.671 --> 01:12:48.201]  And just like Al Capone was taken down, his racket eventually was taken down, this racket has to be taken down.
[01:12:48.461 --> 01:12:52.185]  The Goldman Sachs folks are engaged in racketeering.
[01:12:52.226 --> 01:12:54.428]  There are anti-racketeering laws on the books.
[01:12:54.488 --> 01:12:56.409]  We're good to go.
[01:13:15.299 --> 01:13:16.060]  We're good to go.
[01:13:32.914 --> 01:13:34.516]  Downgrade the debt of Greece.
[01:13:34.876 --> 01:13:41.583]  The day after there's a huge sell-off in the Greek debt by the hedge funds that Moody's is friendly with, that's a racket.
[01:13:42.064 --> 01:13:46.649]  That is not to be condoned in a free market system.
[01:13:47.209 --> 01:13:49.412]  So it's the case should be cut and dry.
[01:13:49.452 --> 01:13:50.273]  Exactly, Max!
[01:13:50.333 --> 01:13:52.115]  So everyone stand up and make that case!
[01:13:52.575 --> 01:13:57.238]  And we've got Republicans saying, this is corporations, this is free market, it's sacrosanct.
[01:13:57.438 --> 01:14:06.424]  We've got the Democrats bought off by the same interest, lying, saying they're bringing him to heel, and trying to stop this, when none of that's happening.
[01:14:07.024 --> 01:14:17.411]  The corruption and the hubris is only accelerating, and meanwhile, people are so scared of a Chinese or a Russian spy, and oh, they're so afraid of an Al-Qaeda
[01:14:17.731 --> 01:14:19.052]  Turbaned brown man.
[01:14:19.453 --> 01:14:37.568]  But when the real threat is these guys in $5,000 suits with Harvard Business School degrees, how do we get the public to realize that in the 21st century it's corporate takeovers, it's corporate espionage trumping governments?
[01:14:37.848 --> 01:14:41.371]  How do we get them to understand that this is life and death, A,
[01:14:42.532 --> 01:14:44.513]  And then, B, where do you see this going?
[01:14:44.673 --> 01:14:47.115]  Because the bankers only seem to show more hubris.
[01:14:47.195 --> 01:14:49.216]  It's like they're completely insane.
[01:14:49.236 --> 01:15:06.267]  I'm so sick of the 9-11 crybabies who are whinging over what, in retrospect, is a minor event in terms of property and loss of life when you compare it to the outrageous financial terrorism of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan.
[01:15:06.747 --> 01:15:09.289]  The people who are living in tents all over America now
[01:15:10.149 --> 01:15:10.569]  I don't
[01:15:28.684 --> 01:15:29.765]  Unemployed this month.
[01:15:29.985 --> 01:15:32.686]  And another, the unemployment benefits are not going to be continued.
[01:15:32.926 --> 01:15:36.068]  And the unemployment rate, the U6, the actual number is over 20%.
[01:15:37.088 --> 01:15:51.256]  And the average guy, the CEO of Walmart, makes, makes, let me put it, the average CEO of Walmart makes in one hour what the average employee at Walmart makes in one year.
[01:15:53.354 --> 01:15:56.215]  One hour he makes what the average worker makes in one year.
[01:15:56.435 --> 01:16:13.220]  Now this is all basically engineered by totally destroying the fundamental supply and demand capitalist system that was in place before the Federal Reserve took over in 1913 and introduced the income tax to pay for all that debt and interest costs, etc.
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:14.200]  And it's perfect!
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:20.882]  They destroy capitalism and then blame what they've done on capitalism.
[01:16:20.942 --> 01:16:21.722]  It's insane.
[01:16:22.677 --> 01:16:27.624]  Well, as a couple of your guests have pointed out, capitalism is not the problem here.
[01:16:27.644 --> 01:16:32.710]  The problem is that the folks are not obeying the laws.
[01:16:33.351 --> 01:16:36.916]  You say that the situation is getting worse, and it is getting worse because
[01:16:37.777 --> 01:16:41.939]  They keep making more money, and they use that money to finance more deregulation.
[01:16:42.159 --> 01:16:44.900]  The Finance Reform Bill, as it's called, is a joke.
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:46.621]  It doesn't reform anything.
[01:16:46.781 --> 01:17:00.247]  It may come into effect many years down the road, and if anything, it just provides additional cover for more of this wealth confiscation that's going on, and the result is what I call two paths.
[01:17:00.407 --> 01:17:05.849]  One is the neo-feudalism, where you're back to the Middle Ages of lords and serfs.
[01:17:06.289 --> 01:17:07.930]  We're good to go.
[01:17:23.739 --> 01:17:39.670]  I'll tell you what, Max, Max Keiser, MaxKeiser.com, do five more minutes with us on the other side if you can, because I want to finish up with the finances and the depression we're openly going into, and then I want to discuss a little bit about the oil spill with Max Keiser.
[01:17:51.118 --> 01:17:52.219]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:17:52.239 --> 01:17:54.400]  We're covering it all, and your phone call's coming up as well.
[01:17:58.322 --> 01:18:02.344]  Is there a favorite radio station or show that you just love and can't stand to miss?
[01:18:02.604 --> 01:18:04.545]  Then you need REPLAY-AV.
[01:18:04.805 --> 01:18:13.529]  With REPLAY-AV, you can set up your PC to record your favorite radio shows, podcasts, XM and Sirius radio feeds, even streaming video automatically.
[01:18:13.769 --> 01:18:14.650]  More than one favorite?
[01:18:14.910 --> 01:18:15.571]  No problem!
[01:18:15.751 --> 01:18:19.554]  Replay AV can simultaneously record multiple shows and stations.
[01:18:19.775 --> 01:18:22.737]  You never have to miss any of your favorite programs again.
[01:18:22.757 --> 01:18:30.785]  Replay AV comes with a built-in media guide to make it easy to find your favorites and a converter for playback in any of the popular formats.
[01:18:30.925 --> 01:18:31.566]  We're good to go.
[01:18:58.067 --> 01:18:59.329]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:18:59.369 --> 01:19:04.736]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:19:04.976 --> 01:19:09.602]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:19:09.983 --> 01:19:15.030]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:19:15.550 --> 01:19:20.251]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:19:20.771 --> 01:19:27.693]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:19:27.893 --> 01:19:28.793]  And here's the best part.
[01:19:29.013 --> 01:19:35.355]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:19:35.695 --> 01:19:39.936]  So you think the massive Gulf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe?
[01:19:39.956 --> 01:19:40.696]  Think again!
[01:20:03.672 --> 01:20:11.156]  Benzene, a toxic gas emitted from crude oil and a known carcinogen, is now airborne traveling hundreds, even thousands of miles inland.
[01:20:11.336 --> 01:20:18.300]  Whether you live near the Gulf or not, benzene and other volatile organic compounds could cause adverse reactions to those living inside your home.

[01:21:01.747 --> 01:21:04.152]  You know what I want, folks?
[01:21:04.253 --> 01:21:04.974]  I want freedom.
[01:21:11.448 --> 01:21:12.549]  Legalize freedom!
[01:21:13.129 --> 01:21:15.130]  Let Uncle Sam out of the POW camp.

[01:21:19.353 --> 01:21:22.575]  Your purchase of the books, the videos, the t-shirts, it funds our operation.
[01:21:22.595 --> 01:21:23.536]  We're having a big effect.
[01:21:23.936 --> 01:21:33.102]  Thanks to you spreading the word about the broadcast and getting films at Infowars.com like Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined, and of course Fall of the Republic that Max Keiser is in.
[01:21:33.462 --> 01:21:34.563]  That film is so important.
[01:21:34.583 --> 01:21:37.745]  You show somebody Fall of the Republic, they'll understand who these crooks are.
[01:21:38.405 --> 01:21:39.166]  I don't think so.
[01:21:55.788 --> 01:22:01.711]  I wanted to get Max's take on the Russian situation, and his take was the same as mine.
[01:22:01.751 --> 01:22:12.997]  It was basically, this signifies a global shift, at least partly, away from give up all your rights, or the man with the turban and a big beard is going to get you.
[01:22:13.398 --> 01:22:19.121]  Now it's give up all your rights, or the gorgeous redhead Russian spy is going to get you.
[01:22:20.641 --> 01:22:24.884]  And again, I have no doubt these people are spies because they were actually infiltrating something that mattered.
[01:22:25.264 --> 01:22:30.187]  British intelligence over 100 years ago began infiltrating Wall Street, the colleges.
[01:22:30.867 --> 01:22:34.709]  That's all declassified because that's where the power is then and where the power is now.
[01:22:35.249 --> 01:22:39.391]  We have a corporate government, so the Russians are infiltrating there for their interest.
[01:22:40.612 --> 01:22:45.435]  But it's a non-issue because America's already been conquered by offshore banks.
[01:22:46.115 --> 01:22:50.943]  Now, if we ever get America back, well then it's a serious issue to have Ruski spies running around on Wall Street.
[01:22:51.264 --> 01:22:52.626]  Max Keiser, your take on that?
[01:22:54.590 --> 01:22:55.271]  Okay, I saw you.
[01:22:55.291 --> 01:22:56.112]  Give me a thumbs up.
[01:22:57.085 --> 01:22:59.546]  Oh, it keeps dropping.
[01:22:59.626 --> 01:22:59.886]  Okay.
[01:23:00.546 --> 01:23:01.806]  So it's kind of like a cartoon.
[01:23:01.846 --> 01:23:02.346]  He's on.
[01:23:02.486 --> 01:23:02.946]  He's not.
[01:23:03.286 --> 01:23:03.806]  He's on.
[01:23:04.087 --> 01:23:04.527]  He's not.
[01:23:04.567 --> 01:23:06.447]  And a very disapproving by the producers.
[01:23:07.307 --> 01:23:09.028]  He's not there, Alex.
[01:23:09.548 --> 01:23:09.828]  Okay.
[01:23:10.268 --> 01:23:12.828]  I thought this, thumbs up meant he was on.
[01:23:13.349 --> 01:23:15.729]  And then thumbs down would mean he wasn't there.
[01:23:16.189 --> 01:23:17.249]  Thumbs up would mean he was there.
[01:23:17.269 --> 01:23:19.710]  Thumbs down would mean he is not there.
[01:23:20.190 --> 01:23:24.251]  Or in a gladiator type event, this would mean don't kill him.
[01:23:25.131 --> 01:23:26.833]  And this would mean kill him.
[01:23:26.853 --> 01:23:33.839]  What do you think the American people would do today if we had actual gladiatorial events going on?
[01:23:34.139 --> 01:23:35.901]  Would they say thumbs up or thumbs down?
[01:23:36.641 --> 01:23:38.863]  Well, humans are very, very brutal, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:39.123 --> 01:23:39.564]  Historical.
[01:23:39.584 --> 01:23:42.326]  That's why we have to have some laws.
[01:23:42.707 --> 01:23:44.608]  A republic, if you can keep it.
[01:23:44.888 --> 01:23:45.969]  A small enough government
[01:23:46.857 --> 01:23:56.301]  To keep another government from coming and taking over or to keep others from basically coalescing to come carry out their crimes against you.
[01:23:57.161 --> 01:23:59.302]  I don't believe in pure anarchy because I know it doesn't exist.
[01:23:59.582 --> 01:24:05.024]  But I want to get as close to total liberty as I can and as small a government as I can.
[01:24:05.664 --> 01:24:16.008]  But I notice the globalists are always pushing and promoting the fact that we basically have to all turn our guns in.
[01:24:18.124 --> 01:24:18.884]  I don't know.
[01:24:37.381 --> 01:24:53.826]  The philosophical minds of the Founding Fathers a lot more than I do some of the silly dreamers out there that are just for no government now and that anyone who even calls for cutting the size of government is bad because that would still mean that we had a government.
[01:24:54.206 --> 01:24:56.046]  Well, no, let's just move towards cutting government.
[01:24:56.326 --> 01:25:03.268]  Max, we were having trouble with your connection, so I need to hold you over five minutes before Bob Chapman so you can finish up with the points, but let's start getting into the Russians.
[01:25:03.569 --> 01:25:04.649]  What's your take on the
[01:25:05.429 --> 01:25:23.076]  Yeah, I think Stacey Herbert, who I co-present the show with, who's my producing partner, and, you know, she had a really good take on this.
[01:25:23.516 --> 01:25:29.418]  There seems to be some fatigue with the whole bearded, crazy, mid-eastern man.
[01:25:29.798 --> 01:25:35.484]  So they're moving the whole fear show over to back to the old Russia.
[01:25:35.524 --> 01:25:37.205]  Stay there, back in 70 seconds.

[01:27:14.506 --> 01:27:18.549]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:27:19.719 --> 01:27:24.305]  Okay, five more minutes with Max Keiser, then Bob Chapman, international forecaster, coming up.
[01:27:24.846 --> 01:27:28.971]  Can't wait to ask him questions about all the big developments in the economy, get his expert take.
[01:27:29.813 --> 01:27:33.778]  I love it when all these experts, Gerald Cilente, Dr. Paul Gregg Roberts, Max Keiser,
[01:27:34.639 --> 01:27:43.242]  Bob Chapman, so many others, Mark Fauber, and basically they're all pretty much saying the same thing, but Max has a way of putting it.
[01:27:43.622 --> 01:27:52.405]  Max, start over, finish up with your point about what we know these Russian, really, intel gatherers were trying to look into.
[01:27:52.426 --> 01:27:56.207]  They wanted to know about gold and silver, because they know the Federal Reserve is rigging it.
[01:27:56.727 --> 01:27:58.709]  I mean, I don't even think that's that big of a deal.
[01:27:58.749 --> 01:28:00.250]  They were trying to find out.
[01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:07.236]  I mean, just like you go and sit in Wall Street bars and hear Goldman Sachs people bragging about raping us three years ago and you warned everybody.
[01:28:07.276 --> 01:28:13.942]  I mean, what, the Russians can't go sit in bars and hear the banker crooks have hijacked the country sit around talking about slitting our throats?
[01:28:14.762 --> 01:28:16.264]  No, I think there's two pieces to this.
[01:28:16.324 --> 01:28:17.505]  The first is that
[01:28:18.323 --> 01:28:35.853]  As I pointed out a second ago, I think there's general fatigue about the bearded man hijacking plane terror fear that's been overplayed and they need to bring in a new cast and the Russian femme fatale has worked in the past and you're going to see a lot more of this.
[01:28:36.633 --> 01:28:46.308]  CFR member, CFR member Angelina Jolie has this movie Salt coming out in a week, all about a gorgeous Russian sleeper agent.
[01:28:46.589 --> 01:28:50.255]  So, I mean, they're definitely been planning this rollout for a while.
[01:28:51.104 --> 01:29:06.390]  Sure, you can't underestimate the influence of those major media companies and pushing, you know, a huge global film releases and they're all tied in on the banking system because they all do, they all share the same banker and they all share a lot of the same information.
[01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:22.348]  But going forward in terms of what the net result of all this recent brouhaha concerning Russian spies, you know, the only piece of hard evidence that's come out, the only piece of hard information was that they had a real strong interest in what's happening in the gold market and the silver market.
[01:29:22.948 --> 01:29:36.615]  And, you know, this corresponds with that story in the UK, in London, where the whistleblower on the London Bullion Market Association showed Gary Gensler at the CFTC how the silver futures market was being manipulated.
[01:29:37.235 --> 01:29:41.838]  And, of course, Gary Gensler, being an ex-Goldman Sachs guy, has done nothing with that information.
[01:29:41.918 --> 01:29:49.782]  And that whistleblower accurately, months before, predicted what was going to happen in the market because he's working with these people and hearing them brag.
[01:29:50.396 --> 01:29:50.576]  Right.
[01:29:50.996 --> 01:29:54.957]  Now we know that Russia has been aggressively accumulating gold.
[01:29:55.257 --> 01:29:56.377]  They're buying lots of gold.
[01:29:56.397 --> 01:29:59.498]  They're probably the most aggressive central bank in the world buying gold.
[01:29:59.918 --> 01:30:04.539]  And also they're buying Canadian dollars, which has some exposure to gold and precious metals.
[01:30:04.879 --> 01:30:11.141]  So there is a link between what's happening on the central bank side of things.
[01:30:11.701 --> 01:30:13.862]  They are accumulating for the first time in decades.
[01:30:13.882 --> 01:30:15.502]  They're net buyers of precious metals.
[01:30:16.102 --> 01:30:21.624]  And they're getting ready for, as you pointed out at the top of the segment, for a new global currency.
[01:30:21.944 --> 01:30:28.806]  Whether it's going to be special drawing rights or some new concatenation of weighted currencies into a new global-type currency.
[01:30:28.846 --> 01:30:37.628]  This is, without a doubt, coming because it's the only way that they're going to be able to re-securitize and re-package these multi... You know, the U.S.
[01:30:37.688 --> 01:30:39.909]  has $14 trillion in debt right now.
[01:30:39.929 --> 01:30:42.490]  They're talking about expanding the debt ceiling to $20 trillion.
[01:30:42.970 --> 01:30:47.272]  They have to repackage all that and resell it to create it and to restart the clock.
[01:30:47.312 --> 01:30:51.713]  And the only way they can do that is to create a new global currency to replace the dollar.
[01:30:52.033 --> 01:30:56.815]  And by the way, the dollar and all these other currencies will be devalued.
[01:30:56.835 --> 01:31:03.377]  They will all be devalued against this new currency against the only thing that they can devalue against, which will be gold.
[01:31:05.564 --> 01:31:14.108]  And meanwhile, they are trying to start a new war so they can politically launch this new order and distract us with the war.
[01:31:14.548 --> 01:31:17.630]  I tell you, Max, this oil spill is getting more suspicious by the minute.
[01:31:19.201 --> 01:31:22.102]  Well, I think it's suspicious in terms of what?
[01:31:22.463 --> 01:31:22.703]  How?
[01:31:23.243 --> 01:31:33.348]  The way they blocked all these foreign governments from coming and helping, the way they gave orders to the well operators they knew would cause it to explode, the way they're pushing their carbon tax to remonetize their new system.
[01:31:33.608 --> 01:31:38.110]  Max, we'll talk to you, come up in a few weeks with your once a month visit, MaxKaiser.com.
[01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:41.371]  I appreciate all the time you spend with us and your great insight.
[01:31:42.192 --> 01:31:46.514]  Hey, if anyone wants to send me a cookie, go to SugarPlumCakeShop.com.
[01:31:48.777 --> 01:31:50.858]  Always some strangeness from Max Keiser.
[01:31:51.198 --> 01:31:51.959]  We'll be right back.
[01:31:51.999 --> 01:31:52.519]  Stay with us.
[01:31:57.381 --> 01:31:59.702]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:31:59.783 --> 01:32:01.964]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:32:01.984 --> 01:32:04.885]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:32:05.305 --> 01:32:10.048]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:32:10.408 --> 01:32:14.610]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:32:14.910 --> 01:32:17.251]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:32:17.271 --> 01:32:19.793]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:32:20.153 --> 01:32:22.714]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:32:23.055 --> 01:32:30.659]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:32:30.990 --> 01:32:36.252]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:32:36.372 --> 01:32:38.653]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:32:38.693 --> 01:32:42.675]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:32:42.915 --> 01:32:43.835]  And I got news for you.
[01:32:43.995 --> 01:32:45.316]  You're everyone else.

[01:33:57.045 --> 01:34:01.909]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:34:02.009 --> 01:34:02.790]  What have we got?
[01:34:03.010 --> 01:34:05.132]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:34:05.452 --> 01:34:06.193]  A republic.
[01:34:06.473 --> 01:34:09.055]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:34:09.115 --> 01:34:11.037]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:34:11.377 --> 01:34:13.279]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:34:13.399 --> 01:34:14.680]  So they think they own our land?
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:16.201]  They think they own our water?
[01:34:16.402 --> 01:34:16.802]  Children?
[01:34:17.002 --> 01:34:17.803]  Our education?
[01:34:18.123 --> 01:34:18.764]  Our money?
[01:34:18.944 --> 01:34:22.607]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:34:22.967 --> 01:34:27.613]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:34:27.933 --> 01:34:28.774]  We have the facts.
[01:34:28.974 --> 01:34:30.075]  We have the Constitution.
[01:34:30.136 --> 01:34:31.017]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:34:31.037 --> 01:34:31.878]  We have common law.
[01:34:31.918 --> 01:34:34.180]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:34.441 --> 01:34:38.225]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:34:38.325 --> 01:34:43.110]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:34:43.290 --> 01:34:44.652]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:34:44.792 --> 01:34:45.613]  Don't tread on me.
[01:34:45.873 --> 01:34:52.740]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:35:02.662 --> 01:35:06.845]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:35:07.486 --> 01:35:08.327]  You want answers?
[01:35:09.087 --> 01:35:10.989]  Well, so does he.
[01:35:11.009 --> 01:35:14.271]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:35:14.812 --> 01:35:18.935]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:35:19.876 --> 01:35:27.162]  The Wall Street Journal marveled two days ago saying, this is the most unconventional spies we've ever seen.
[01:35:28.973 --> 01:35:35.695]  Good-looking women trying to get into Wall Street, people infiltrating Harvard, infiltrating social network sites.
[01:35:37.076 --> 01:35:38.696]  I mean, this was clearly a sleeper cell.
[01:35:38.796 --> 01:35:41.217]  Fake names, illegally here, married.
[01:35:41.377 --> 01:35:42.418]  They're spies, okay?
[01:35:42.818 --> 01:35:44.198]  Unless that's all a hoax.
[01:35:44.618 --> 01:35:53.481]  And we did see the FBI hoax about Hatari, and they've been ordered released, and then the feds tried to block that, and that got trumped again, and so that appeal got defeated.
[01:35:53.841 --> 01:35:55.182]  So it may be a hoax, but
[01:35:56.124 --> 01:36:02.031]  That redhead is supermodel beautiful, and they are here illegally, and they are spies.
[01:36:02.091 --> 01:36:04.154]  I mean, all the evidence shows that.
[01:36:04.354 --> 01:36:07.878]  But it's very interesting that you have spies infiltrating Wall Street.
[01:36:08.599 --> 01:36:12.904]  If you study what the British did 100 years ago, and the CFR around 80 years ago, 1924,
[01:36:16.363 --> 01:36:37.426]  Was they infiltrated New York and the robber barons and had British wealth and their robber barons marry with our robber barons and in the two-part history of the English-speaking peoples, which I've read, by the way, incredible, by Winston Churchill, he admits all this, okay, the British brag, they took America back over.
[01:36:38.327 --> 01:36:39.288]  It's more of a merger.
[01:36:39.328 --> 01:36:40.408]  It's kind of like a marriage.
[01:36:40.428 --> 01:36:41.929]  In fact, that's how they describe it.
[01:36:41.949 --> 01:36:42.909]  So I wouldn't say take over.
[01:36:43.149 --> 01:36:44.290]  They moved in together again.
[01:36:44.970 --> 01:36:49.912]  Of course, Churchill was half American and the other half royal with the Duke of Marlborough.
[01:36:50.792 --> 01:36:55.734]  Famous footage we've got of Churchill and his wife actually going to a meeting with the Queen wearing crowns.
[01:36:55.754 --> 01:37:00.036]  Because back in the old days, royalty would still wear their little sub-crowns to go meet with the Queen.
[01:37:02.443 --> 01:37:05.464]  I'm going to talk to Bob Chapman because he was in U.S.
[01:37:05.504 --> 01:37:13.267]  intelligence, Army intelligence assigned to, well we won't get into the agency, up against the Ruskies and the media is saying this is a new type of spying.
[01:37:13.307 --> 01:37:13.768]  No it's not.
[01:37:13.968 --> 01:37:15.268]  This is real spying.
[01:37:15.848 --> 01:37:16.169]  Okay?
[01:37:16.269 --> 01:37:18.369]  Most spying is economic espionage.
[01:37:19.130 --> 01:37:21.271]  And it just shows the Russians know what to infiltrate.
[01:37:21.551 --> 01:37:26.053]  The Congress is a rubber stamp, a bunch of whores that don't read 94% of the bills.
[01:37:26.353 --> 01:37:27.513]  The treason is corporate.
[01:37:27.713 --> 01:37:29.234]  Globalism is a corporate takeover.
[01:37:30.464 --> 01:37:32.266]  Okay, it's corporate espionage.
[01:37:32.926 --> 01:37:40.873]  So while we're afraid of the Ruskies, and they could be a threat, China's much bigger, 3,000 plus admitted front companies, totally infiltrating us.
[01:37:41.254 --> 01:37:43.236]  Our government sold us out and de-industrializes.
[01:37:43.416 --> 01:37:49.041]  We talked to Bob Chapman about that, but Max wanted to say some kind words about Bob, and explain that cookie thing.
[01:37:49.521 --> 01:37:56.548]  Now I know, he plugs a cookie shop down the street from him in Paris, and they get thousands of emails every time he plugs them, and then he gets a free cookie.
[01:37:57.068 --> 01:38:00.351]  Now, I tell you, that is some expensive cookie there.
[01:38:00.371 --> 01:38:02.793]  I mean, a plug on this show is probably worth about $1,000.
[01:38:03.133 --> 01:38:09.898]  And that's fine, Max, but if you want to spend your plugs that way without saying MaxKaiser.com, then you can go ahead and plug the cookies.
[01:38:09.918 --> 01:38:11.840]  But I hope you're getting more than one cookie.
[01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:13.221]  Tell us about your favorite cookie place.
[01:38:13.741 --> 01:38:24.208]  Yeah, the sugarplumcakeshop.com down the street from where I live, the new bakery in my neighborhood run by these three women.
[01:38:24.528 --> 01:38:27.750]  Very, very attractive, cute, perky women.
[01:38:27.770 --> 01:38:30.872]  So that's what's happening is you're actually hitting on the women right now?
[01:38:31.412 --> 01:38:32.293]  Basically, yeah.
[01:38:32.473 --> 01:38:33.153]  Basically, yeah.
[01:38:33.373 --> 01:38:41.619]  So, I mean, you PayPal them, you know, $5 at sugarplumcakeshop.com and I'll be sure to get a cookie.
[01:38:42.384 --> 01:38:51.308]  Okay, this is part of the... Brainiacs like to screw around with funny jokes, and I've noticed that the eccentric types do that.
[01:38:51.328 --> 01:38:59.192]  I'm eccentric myself at some levels, but you're now basically prostituting people to worship the women over there, but that's fine.
[01:38:59.232 --> 01:39:01.293]  I hope people buy you some cookies.
[01:39:01.553 --> 01:39:03.153]  Max Keiser, we'll see you again in a few weeks.
[01:39:03.193 --> 01:39:03.834]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:39:04.537 --> 01:39:05.097]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:39:05.697 --> 01:39:06.018]  You bet.
[01:39:06.038 --> 01:39:06.418]  Take care.
[01:39:06.878 --> 01:39:08.438]  Maybe there's Russian spies over there.
[01:39:08.478 --> 01:39:09.699]  No, I'm being sarcastic.
[01:39:09.999 --> 01:39:10.979]  Okay, let's get serious.
[01:39:11.239 --> 01:39:18.082]  Let's go to Bob Chapman, who had the biggest financial newsletter in the world until he retired more than a decade ago.
[01:39:18.102 --> 01:39:20.362]  Of course, the biggest private silver and gold broker.
[01:39:20.402 --> 01:39:21.263]  He's lived all over the world.
[01:39:21.303 --> 01:39:23.063]  South Africa, France, Germany, you name it.
[01:39:24.104 --> 01:39:27.745]  And during the break, we forgot to get the plug.
[01:39:27.805 --> 01:39:32.466]  Max was telling me how for decades he's been reading what Bob Chapman has to say.
[01:39:32.506 --> 01:39:33.087]  So there's another
[01:39:34.327 --> 01:39:34.608]  I think?
[01:39:53.447 --> 01:40:15.873]  My take on these Russian sex operatives, sleeper sex operatives is what I would call them, and the fact that they're trying to relaunch a new Cold War on the back of this, but more interestingly that you see the Russians trying to infiltrate the gold and silver market to try to find out what's happening in New York, because they're big buyers, because they know it's rigged, and also infiltrating Harvard and
[01:40:17.153 --> 01:40:21.195]  Facebook-style systems.
[01:40:21.615 --> 01:40:25.417]  I mean, that's really where the real black ops are going on.
[01:40:25.437 --> 01:40:27.217]  Or do you disagree, Bob Chapman?
[01:40:28.378 --> 01:40:35.361]  Well, it's certainly on the ground a type of counterintelligence.
[01:40:35.701 --> 01:40:40.943]  And you are very, very right in saying that is real spying.
[01:40:41.603 --> 01:40:42.104]  And you're right.
[01:40:42.644 --> 01:40:45.065]  Everything else is usually done by satellite today.
[01:40:45.994 --> 01:40:54.162]  And one of the complaints about the good guys inside the CIA is, we didn't do any of that anymore.
[01:40:54.482 --> 01:40:56.284]  Or we're not doing much of that anymore.
[01:40:56.664 --> 01:40:57.945]  And that's where the action is.
[01:40:58.406 --> 01:40:59.747]  And so the Russians have done it.
[01:41:00.287 --> 01:41:02.470]  And they've done it over and over again.
[01:41:03.170 --> 01:41:04.652]  And they're really good at it.
[01:41:04.672 --> 01:41:11.458]  I mean, people in America discount the abilities of people in other countries.
[01:41:12.622 --> 01:41:14.423]  The Russians are very bright people.
[01:41:14.543 --> 01:41:15.764]  I know I worked against them.
[01:41:16.544 --> 01:41:23.126]  And so, it's not surprising they have such units within the United States, and they probably are guilty.
[01:41:23.687 --> 01:41:27.628]  But I think in your conversation with Max, the timing is very important.
[01:41:28.108 --> 01:41:41.774]  This has been a well-planned takedown and furtherance operation, perhaps because of the wearing out of the terrorism label, and maybe we've got to find some new bogeyman, who in this case would be the Russians again.
[01:41:42.717 --> 01:41:45.599]  And, yes, the Russians have been buying gold for a long time.
[01:41:46.239 --> 01:41:48.000]  And they're expediting their purchases.
[01:41:48.561 --> 01:41:51.382]  And we've covered all this in the International Forecaster.
[01:41:52.123 --> 01:42:06.291]  But, uh, I think, and I'm only guessing, that the Russians are monitoring, monitoring, monitoring, yes, I get it out, monitoring, um, several publications.
[01:42:06.371 --> 01:42:07.192]  Mayan's one of them.
[01:42:07.892 --> 01:42:10.654]  And, uh, Jigater is another one.
[01:42:11.543 --> 01:42:24.986]  And, uh, they attended, uh, a very high Russian official from the finance, uh, division of the Russian government, um, back about eight years ago, attended one of Gettys' meetings in Alaska.
[01:42:25.526 --> 01:42:27.486]  If I'm not mistaken, that's the location.
[01:42:28.286 --> 01:42:29.707]  And, uh, they got filled in.
[01:42:29.727 --> 01:42:36.788]  And, and they saw the direction that things would eventually have to go and knew they had to accumulate.
[01:42:37.468 --> 01:42:40.969]  And they knew from attending that meeting and, and reading
[01:42:41.468 --> 01:42:41.568]  Yes.
[01:43:11.983 --> 01:43:12.483]  We're good to go.
[01:43:36.077 --> 01:43:40.840]  And that they are planning to sell derivatives and destroy the world economy.
[01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:44.542]  I mean, that was in Newsmax, WorldNetDaily, Infowars.com.
[01:43:45.342 --> 01:43:47.304]  Rick Wiles covered it eight, nine years ago.
[01:43:47.904 --> 01:43:54.008]  And, I mean, I just forget how right we've all been about what these people were planning and shifting gears.
[01:43:54.988 --> 01:43:56.389]  What does this signify, Bob?
[01:43:56.449 --> 01:44:01.813]  Because it's old news for our listeners and our audience and people that read your International Forecaster newsletter.
[01:44:03.359 --> 01:44:11.209]  But what does it signify to now have the U.N., CNN, ABC News, AP, Reuters, all announced Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday?
[01:44:11.249 --> 01:44:13.311]  Today, it's made national news.
[01:44:13.411 --> 01:44:17.556]  Our story is one of the top stories on drudge, dollar plunges after U.N.
[01:44:17.596 --> 01:44:19.339]  call to ditch Greenback.
[01:44:19.959 --> 01:44:21.521]  All of this is happening
[01:44:22.703 --> 01:44:36.717]  And so what does it signify that they're coming out saying, okay, all the currencies are going to stay, but they're going to be devalued, and a private group of banks is going to run it, and it's going to be world government, as Herman Van Rompuy said last November, the head of the EU.
[01:44:37.758 --> 01:44:43.862]  And you will now pay your carbon taxes to us, and we will have a new SDR over the whole globe.
[01:44:43.902 --> 01:44:51.146]  I mean, this is a private group of bankers that have created the fraud, openly announcing the takeover of our currency.
[01:44:51.206 --> 01:44:58.771]  This is the highest form of economic takeover, and everyone involved in the government is guilty of high treason.
[01:45:00.672 --> 01:45:02.213]  And that's absolutely so.
[01:45:02.673 --> 01:45:05.295]  It doesn't mean they're going to be successful in doing what they're doing.
[01:45:05.748 --> 01:45:21.677]  They're having to expedite their program for the very reasons that you and I have discussed over and over again, and that is we're letting people know exactly what they're doing, how they're doing it, and what they expect as a final product.
[01:45:22.898 --> 01:45:28.301]  I think that you have to look at the directions that they've gone in recently.
[01:45:29.061 --> 01:45:35.085]  I think Greece blew up in their face, and they still may very well lose
[01:45:35.811 --> 01:45:42.280]  They being the Illuminists, the services of Pomp and Drail, because I keep on drilling them over there to get rid of them.
[01:45:43.201 --> 01:45:45.744]  And maybe that will have an effect.
[01:45:46.665 --> 01:45:53.094]  But that's what they need to do, and they need to default, get out of the euro, go to the drachma,
[01:45:53.917 --> 01:46:17.044]  And, uh, also, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
[01:46:22.413 --> 01:46:27.678]  And I told him, I said, if you have... They just did another documentary, I don't think it's been released yet.
[01:46:28.078 --> 01:46:32.403]  But I told him, I said, if you can impeach him, however you do it, get rid of him.
[01:46:33.203 --> 01:46:37.087]  And you don't want to let any of your islands go for 20 or 30 cents on the dollar.
[01:46:37.703 --> 01:46:51.403]  Well, I mean, literally, they swindle them selling them these derivatives, and then the country is selling the islands to the heads of the brokerage firms by name that set them up.
[01:46:51.503 --> 01:46:52.004]  I mean, this is...
[01:46:52.865 --> 01:46:57.729]  They should be calling for these people's arrest, not giving them their islands and their highways.
[01:46:58.049 --> 01:46:59.290]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:46:59.330 --> 01:47:04.693]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:47:04.934 --> 01:47:09.557]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:47:09.937 --> 01:47:14.981]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:47:15.521 --> 01:47:20.204]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:47:20.745 --> 01:47:22.666]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:47:23.046 --> 01:47:27.649]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:47:27.849 --> 01:47:28.750]  And here's the best part.
[01:47:28.970 --> 01:47:31.732]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:47:32.052 --> 01:47:35.354]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[01:47:45.641 --> 01:47:47.422]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:47:49.864 --> 01:47:54.387]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:47:54.707 --> 01:47:57.089]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:47:59.281 --> 01:48:04.984]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[01:48:05.724 --> 01:48:10.167]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.
[01:48:10.987 --> 01:48:24.354]  Featuring Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Joseph Farah, David Icke, Naomi Wolf, G. Edward Griffin, Doug McIntyre, Mark Crispin Miller, Mickey Z, Doug Casey, David McElhaney, and myself, Alex Jones.
[01:48:25.314 --> 01:48:29.757]  Protect yourself and get the tools you need to protect your family from these difficult times.

[01:48:57.757 --> 01:49:07.481]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[01:49:07.781 --> 01:49:13.824]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[01:49:14.204 --> 01:49:23.048]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[01:49:23.428 --> 01:49:32.358]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[01:49:32.619 --> 01:49:37.204]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[01:49:37.224 --> 01:49:38.786]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:49:39.026 --> 01:49:41.529]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[01:49:41.809 --> 01:49:43.310]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.

[01:49:50.053 --> 01:49:50.393]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[01:49:58.635 --> 01:49:59.275]  The problem.
[01:49:59.375 --> 01:50:01.416]  How do I cook food without power?
[01:50:01.936 --> 01:50:04.116]  How do I light my home with no electricity?
[01:50:04.656 --> 01:50:06.837]  How do I get emergency radio broadcast?
[01:50:07.337 --> 01:50:08.977]  How can I make safe drinking water?
[01:50:09.817 --> 01:50:18.619]  When your power goes out, the solution for cooking, baking, home lighting, listening to the radio, and producing clean water is the Family Emergency Kit from KeroStove.
[01:50:18.819 --> 01:50:25.861]  KeroStove has been in business for over 12 years with the largest selection of kerosene stoves and family preparedness supplies in the U.S.

[01:50:53.481 --> 01:50:54.241]  KeroStove.
[01:50:54.441 --> 01:50:56.582]  For family emergency solutions.
[01:50:58.143 --> 01:51:00.345]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:51:00.905 --> 01:51:03.707]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:51:10.731 --> 01:51:18.794]  Coming up in the next segment, we're going to be taking some of your phone calls, and I'm going to play this clip and get Bob Chapman's take on it, of Congressman Pete Stark.
[01:51:20.174 --> 01:51:33.678]  You've seen little clips on the news the last few days, but we have the whole 10-minute exchange posted up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, where he just says, there's no problem with the border, and anybody that wants to control the border wants to kill people.
[01:51:34.279 --> 01:51:37.900]  I mean, their propaganda is just arrogantly delivered, it's asinine,
[01:51:38.980 --> 01:51:41.682]  And we see this throughout history where elites get into trouble.
[01:51:42.282 --> 01:51:44.604]  A lot of times they just become even more arrogant.
[01:51:45.044 --> 01:51:47.726]  And that only hastens their implosion.
[01:51:48.667 --> 01:51:54.451]  But Bob, I'm starting to think more and more Gerald Cilente may be right again, putting a date on it.
[01:51:55.291 --> 01:52:04.118]  We've seen top New York Times, Wall Street Journal and other writers saying we are in the greatest depression or the third depression.
[01:52:05.259 --> 01:52:08.021]  Obama's now calling it the greatest recession.
[01:52:08.882 --> 01:52:12.125]  By every yardstick, as you said two years ago, we are in a depression.
[01:52:13.826 --> 01:52:15.547]  Do you think they may announce it?
[01:52:15.607 --> 01:52:22.413]  Because they're now saying they're not going to have a second stimulus, which you've said would put this off another year.
[01:52:24.495 --> 01:52:33.162]  Well, first of all, I think if they are going to say we're in a depression, they're going to wait until they start their war and then blame the depression on the war.
[01:52:34.714 --> 01:52:36.975]  That's logical, and that's what they've done before.
[01:52:37.655 --> 01:52:45.777]  And so that might be an up-and-coming event that may start out in a limited way with Iran and may spread.
[01:52:46.737 --> 01:52:48.498]  Russia may be brought into it.
[01:52:49.018 --> 01:52:58.581]  And the recent apprehension of these spies might be a lead into that, as you indicated it could be a lead into something.
[01:52:59.561 --> 01:53:03.662]  And so, you know, the groundwork is there.
[01:53:05.053 --> 01:53:10.258]  And they could very well go ahead with it, but I don't think they're going to use the word depression.
[01:53:11.539 --> 01:53:25.712]  Maybe Paul Krugman can in the New York Times, but I don't think you're going to see it officially coming out from any important alumnus or the President of the United States until it's time.
[01:53:26.633 --> 01:53:28.075]  And as far as
[01:53:29.529 --> 01:53:31.071]  Uh, stimulus in the economy.
[01:53:31.651 --> 01:53:36.155]  Um, I don't think under present circumstances they can get the stimulus they want.
[01:53:36.575 --> 01:53:38.157]  Although maybe it's still possible.
[01:53:38.637 --> 01:53:52.029]  But, you know, the Federal Reserve is perfectly capable of putting five trillion dollars into the economy between now and the election two and a half years from now.
[01:53:53.009 --> 01:53:57.033]  And that could keep the markets up to an extent.
[01:53:58.118 --> 01:54:04.762]  Although I do think they're going down, maybe they wouldn't, during that time period, go as low as they might go.
[01:54:04.982 --> 01:54:10.166]  But they have the ability to keep the economy going sideways to slightly higher.
[01:54:11.907 --> 01:54:25.295]  I think they could get employment going in the other direction, and they could do that by allowing, or forcing, banks to lend to small and medium-sized businesses, which they're not doing.
[01:54:26.014 --> 01:54:29.177]  And that money is being held in abeyance, and they have lots of it.
[01:54:29.277 --> 01:54:31.779]  Well, Bob, we're only four months away from the election.
[01:54:31.799 --> 01:54:41.447]  I mean, if they're going to fully implode the economy and start a war, wouldn't they start the war before the election and then implode the economy fully after the election?
[01:54:42.828 --> 01:54:43.448]  Good timing.
[01:54:43.588 --> 01:54:45.530]  That's what I expect them to do.
[01:54:46.771 --> 01:54:50.234]  And the talk about the devaluation of the dollar is true.
[01:54:50.334 --> 01:54:51.034]  Max is right.
[01:54:52.233 --> 01:54:55.775]  Wonderful stuff he's putting out, and so is Gerald.
[01:54:56.555 --> 01:55:00.857]  And, you know, and yourself, we just keep on hammering.
[01:55:00.937 --> 01:55:01.717]  I just love it.
[01:55:02.057 --> 01:55:03.878]  Love it, because we're going to get them.
[01:55:04.628 --> 01:55:05.989]  They're not going to be successful.
[01:55:07.270 --> 01:55:08.651]  It's going to be very painful.
[01:55:08.892 --> 01:55:11.654]  Here's just a little side note.
[01:55:11.674 --> 01:55:16.157]  70 million expired flu vaccines admitted to be incinerated as waste.
[01:55:17.058 --> 01:55:21.241]  That's being reported by the Associated Press, also Natural News.
[01:55:21.882 --> 01:55:26.585]  But now they admit that no one needed to take the H1N1 shot, that it was also dangerous.
[01:55:27.466 --> 01:55:30.729]  But separately they're trying to make people take last year's shot.
[01:55:32.290 --> 01:55:33.130]  Recommending it?
[01:55:33.831 --> 01:55:44.816]  I mean, they are just totally discrediting themselves, or is the government and these criminal corporations, are they marketing to that 30% that they know is as dumb as a box of rocks?
[01:55:47.058 --> 01:55:47.918]  And they always will.
[01:55:47.958 --> 01:55:53.321]  That's why Hollywood points their pitches towards 12 and 13 year old mentalities.
[01:55:53.981 --> 01:56:00.745]  And things haven't changed that much, you know, over the intervening years, we'll say, since the beginning of the 20th century.
[01:56:02.049 --> 01:56:05.832]  Uh, people are still fundamentally, uh, intellectually the same.
[01:56:06.633 --> 01:56:13.259]  And, uh, you know, all of the teaching in the world and, uh, can't raise an IQ very much.
[01:56:14.099 --> 01:56:16.381]  And so, yes, they're appealing to that.
[01:56:16.661 --> 01:56:20.284]  They're appealing to anything that they can appeal to.
[01:56:21.045 --> 01:56:22.767]  Desperate people do desperate things.
[01:56:23.347 --> 01:56:26.490]  And as Brzezinski said, we're in trouble.
[01:56:26.530 --> 01:56:27.851]  These people know what we're doing.
[01:56:30.319 --> 01:56:31.199]  You're absolutely right.
[01:56:31.239 --> 01:56:33.460]  Bob Chapman, our guest for the rest of the hour.
[01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:38.962]  Then we have a filmmaker joining us who's got solutions to this banking crime syndicate.
[01:56:39.042 --> 01:56:40.322]  Oh, it's not enough to just get rid of them.
[01:56:40.342 --> 01:56:41.323]  We've got to have solutions.
[01:56:41.743 --> 01:56:42.763]  That's coming up as well.
[01:56:43.203 --> 01:56:43.643]  Stay with us.
[01:56:47.905 --> 01:56:48.805]  We're on the march.
[01:56:49.305 --> 01:56:50.886]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:56:51.826 --> 01:56:54.507]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:56:57.153 --> 01:57:01.395]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:57:01.695 --> 01:57:02.335]  Number one.
[01:57:02.615 --> 01:57:05.776]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:57:06.036 --> 01:57:06.596]  Number two.
[01:57:06.896 --> 01:57:11.458]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:57:11.798 --> 01:57:12.238]  It's true.
[01:57:12.538 --> 01:57:17.100]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:17.960]  Number three.
[01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:21.522]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:57:21.822 --> 01:57:25.523]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:57:25.723 --> 01:57:26.264]  Number 4.
[01:57:26.524 --> 01:57:28.886]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:57:29.287 --> 01:57:32.670]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:57:32.971 --> 01:57:33.491]  Number 5.
[01:57:33.751 --> 01:57:37.676]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:57:37.896 --> 01:57:42.661]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:57:42.941 --> 01:57:46.968]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:57:47.128 --> 01:57:48.690]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:57:48.911 --> 01:57:50.994]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:57:51.154 --> 01:57:53.518]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:57:57.591 --> 01:58:00.194]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:58:00.594 --> 01:58:05.559]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:58:05.919 --> 01:58:07.661]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:58:07.981 --> 01:58:12.786]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:58:12.986 --> 01:58:13.947]  How much do you want?
[01:58:14.168 --> 01:58:14.908]  When do you want it?
[01:58:15.289 --> 01:58:16.890]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:58:17.170 --> 01:58:17.991]  When will you need it?
[01:58:18.252 --> 01:58:20.314]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:58:20.454 --> 01:58:21.435]  Will there be any food?
[01:58:21.775 --> 01:58:23.097]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:58:23.297 --> 01:58:28.363]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:58:28.563 --> 01:58:31.746]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:58:32.147 --> 01:58:35.651]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:58:35.971 --> 01:58:36.732]  How much will you need?
[01:58:37.192 --> 01:58:37.792]  We don't know.
[01:58:38.093 --> 01:58:38.993]  How much do you want?
[01:58:39.193 --> 01:58:39.933]  All you can get.
[01:58:40.134 --> 01:58:40.974]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:58:41.214 --> 01:58:43.975]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:58:44.276 --> 01:58:46.016]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:58:46.036 --> 01:58:46.977]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:58:57.847 --> 01:59:03.569]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[01:59:04.290 --> 01:59:08.731]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.
[01:59:09.552 --> 01:59:23.097]  Featuring Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Joseph Farah, David Icke, Naomi Wolf, G. Edward Griffin, Doug McIntyre, Mark Crispin Miller, Mickey Z, Doug Casey, David McIlvaney, and myself, Alex Jones.
[01:59:23.877 --> 01:59:28.321]  Protect yourself and get the tools you need to protect your family from these difficult times.
[01:59:28.901 --> 01:59:38.529]  The Fall of America and the Western World at www.thefallofamerica.net or click on the banners at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:59:39.129 --> 01:59:44.253]  Again, that website's www.thefallofamerica.net or call 800-655-1577.
[01:59:44.273 --> 01:59:47.136]  Prepare yourself and the ones you love today.
[01:59:47.176 --> 01:59:48.517]  fallofamerica.net
[02:00:10.491 --> 02:00:15.233]  There's a couple of clips I want to play right now and get Bob's take on.
[02:00:15.453 --> 02:00:26.476]  The first one is Herman Van Rompuy from back in November saying the G20 and the Copenhagen Summit is going to be the birth of global governance.
[02:00:27.216 --> 02:00:31.317]  And notice, it's for the carbon tax, it's for the oil spill, it's for the banking collapse.
[02:00:32.617 --> 02:00:37.439]  The banks want to directly tax you and not have to deal with governments anymore.
[02:00:37.839 --> 02:00:38.759]  They want to be above it.
[02:00:39.957 --> 02:00:42.479]  We can create a new level of Ponzi scheme.
[02:00:43.460 --> 02:00:45.562]  Actual world government run by private interest.
[02:00:46.563 --> 02:00:55.090]  So let's go ahead and play that clip and then I want to move on to another traitor, another arrogant sack of horse manure.
[02:00:55.130 --> 02:00:56.211]  I'm sorry to use that term.
[02:00:56.231 --> 02:00:57.292]  There's a long way to describe him.
[02:00:57.693 --> 02:00:58.814]  Congressman Pete Stark.
[02:00:59.214 --> 02:01:00.595]  But let's play Herman Von Rumpy.
[02:01:00.615 --> 02:01:01.035]  Here it is.
[02:01:01.836 --> 02:01:07.181]  These problems can be overcome by a joint effort in and between our countries.
[02:01:08.973 --> 02:01:15.735]  2009 is also the first year of global governance with the establishment of the G20 in the middle of the financial crisis.
[02:01:16.755 --> 02:01:23.177]  The climate conference in Copenhagen is another step towards the global management of our planet.
[02:01:25.478 --> 02:01:25.938]  Our mission
[02:01:27.173 --> 02:01:28.553]  Our presidency is one of hope.
[02:01:28.934 --> 02:01:29.214]  All right.
[02:01:29.674 --> 02:01:30.814]  Supported by acts.
[02:01:31.174 --> 02:01:36.036]  And then you've got not just Von Ruppe but Ban Ki-moon of the UN and all of them saying the same thing.
[02:01:36.056 --> 02:01:50.040]  I just want to get that on record now that they've gone from just talking about it in their global conferences to openly telling you the answer to all your financial problems that we caused by design is giving us more power and paying us more money.
[02:01:50.520 --> 02:01:52.901]  The answer to that oil spill is paying us more money.
[02:01:53.221 --> 02:01:55.342]  And we'll talk to Bob about the oil spill but first
[02:01:55.963 --> 02:01:58.520]  I want to play this clip because you've seen little clips on the news.
[02:01:59.875 --> 02:02:14.646]  This was so arrogant that they happened to have Chris Matthews on for entertainment value in the coffee room Wednesday night and I walked in there Wednesday afternoon and he played the Pete Stark clip where Stark was being arrogant saying you want to shoot people don't you?
[02:02:14.927 --> 02:02:15.787]  You don't want to open borders?
[02:02:15.927 --> 02:02:16.868]  You want to kill people?
[02:02:16.948 --> 02:02:26.816]  Just to a town hall in California people are like no we're not even Minutemen but they're not killing people and like there's no border problem I mean even
[02:02:29.872 --> 02:02:34.896]  Chris Matthews, a Democrat hack, had to say, my gosh, is that not the face of incumbency?
[02:02:35.377 --> 02:02:36.838]  I mean, this arrogant creature.
[02:02:37.639 --> 02:02:41.943]  Now, the whole video, it's like 10 minutes long, is up on InfoWars and Prison Planet, unedited.
[02:02:42.283 --> 02:02:49.749]  But for time constraints, I'm just going to play the first minute or two, and then get Bob Chapman's take on this, because this is arrogance.
[02:02:49.789 --> 02:02:51.771]  I mean, Mexico is admittedly collapsed.
[02:02:52.352 --> 02:02:55.334]  The State Department, foreign governments say it's a failed state.
[02:02:56.275 --> 02:02:59.019]  Now it's 23,000 deaths in the last two years.
[02:02:59.039 --> 02:03:02.764]  80 plus miles of Arizona is off limits to citizens.
[02:03:03.545 --> 02:03:05.728]  I mean, it is just total bedlam.
[02:03:06.408 --> 02:03:07.209]  Total bedlam.
[02:03:07.730 --> 02:03:11.415]  I mean, South Texas is just shutting down in the border areas.
[02:03:13.675 --> 02:03:24.738]  I saw a news clip, in fact, I ought to pull that up, of Detroit, where they deliver food to the food lions and stuff, and they have guys with machine guns guarding the food now, going into grocery stores.
[02:03:24.798 --> 02:03:28.978]  I mean, Mad Max stuff and tent cities are creeping in everywhere.
[02:03:28.998 --> 02:03:30.659]  And it's only going to get worse.
[02:03:30.699 --> 02:03:32.179]  This is what Naftangat did.
[02:03:32.719 --> 02:03:35.000]  And this guy thinks it's all funny!
[02:03:35.780 --> 02:03:39.681]  I mean, whether you're for open borders or not, don't say the border isn't open.
[02:03:40.121 --> 02:03:41.622]  Don't say there isn't a problem.
[02:03:41.662 --> 02:03:42.982]  Don't say it isn't horrible.
[02:03:43.522 --> 02:03:50.924]  Don't say there aren't these poor Mexicans sneaking across, getting killed by the hundreds every month and robbed by coyotes on the Mexican and U.S.
[02:03:50.944 --> 02:03:51.304]  side.
[02:03:51.964 --> 02:03:53.505]  I mean, this is dangerous, folks.
[02:03:53.565 --> 02:03:55.125]  This is lawlessness.
[02:03:55.165 --> 02:03:56.965]  This is like Afghanistan or something.
[02:03:57.546 --> 02:03:58.006]  Here it is.
[02:03:58.026 --> 02:04:01.047]  The men and women wanted to have something to say.
[02:04:03.607 --> 02:04:05.168]  Who are you going to kill today?
[02:04:06.289 --> 02:04:07.230]  Who are we going to kill today?
[02:04:07.250 --> 02:04:07.450]  Yeah.
[02:04:07.470 --> 02:04:13.536]  Well, I just would like to know, well, actually American citizens are being killed right now by this drug war that's going on.
[02:04:13.596 --> 02:04:14.036]  That's right.
[02:04:14.216 --> 02:04:22.504]  Okay, I want to know why the federal government is not doing anything or a lot more to seal our borders in this country so that we're a solvent country again.
[02:04:22.884 --> 02:04:25.045]  Well, we can't get enough Minutemen armed.
[02:04:25.285 --> 02:04:30.127]  We'd like to get all the Minutemen armed so that they can stop shooting people here.
[02:04:30.287 --> 02:04:31.607]  It's not our job.
[02:04:31.627 --> 02:04:33.848]  We're just citizens of the United States government.
[02:04:33.888 --> 02:04:44.071]  So he calls anybody in the crowd, because it goes on, who's for sovereignty and defending our borders, Minutemen who want to kill more people and have killed people.
[02:04:44.311 --> 02:04:45.772]  The Minutemen have killed no one.
[02:04:46.798 --> 02:04:51.365]  Okay, so this is what Saul Alinsky taught communists to do.
[02:04:51.705 --> 02:04:53.247]  Accuse people of what you do.
[02:04:53.748 --> 02:04:59.316]  The illegal aliens and the drug traffickers are the ones killing people, so he's saying, oh no, the Minutemen are killing people.
[02:04:59.336 --> 02:04:59.857]  Let's continue.
[02:05:00.689 --> 02:05:02.150]  We're trying to get you some more arms.
[02:05:21.744 --> 02:05:22.746]  We don't want to go down there.
[02:05:22.766 --> 02:05:24.650]  We want to have lives, normal lives.
[02:05:24.670 --> 02:05:28.839]  We pay taxes and we pay to have the government take care of our borders.
[02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:29.801]  Is that all?
[02:05:30.582 --> 02:05:31.504]  Is that all what?
[02:05:31.544 --> 02:05:32.286]  The government should do?
[02:05:33.214 --> 02:05:35.315]  Well, that's one of the things the government is supposed to do.
[02:05:35.335 --> 02:05:36.936]  That's what the federal government is there for.
[02:05:36.956 --> 02:05:41.799]  They said they were going to do it and they're not doing it.
[02:05:42.039 --> 02:05:44.340]  Well, then we don't need the Minutemen.
[02:05:44.420 --> 02:05:44.980]  That's correct.
[02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:45.861]  We don't want them.
[02:05:45.901 --> 02:05:47.361]  Let's send the Minutemen home.
[02:05:47.421 --> 02:05:48.902]  That's a good idea.
[02:05:49.022 --> 02:05:50.383]  Answer the question.
[02:05:50.463 --> 02:05:51.083]  What answer?
[02:05:51.123 --> 02:05:52.884]  Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[02:05:52.944 --> 02:05:55.746]  You don't want to... What kind of an answer would you like, young man?
[02:05:55.786 --> 02:05:58.107]  He asked the question.
[02:05:58.427 --> 02:06:00.588]  Do you mind if I answer his question?
[02:06:00.688 --> 02:06:01.129]  Excuse me.
[02:06:01.889 --> 02:06:04.510]  Please do answer the question.
[02:06:04.530 --> 02:06:05.611]  Yeah, what's your question?
[02:06:05.971 --> 02:06:12.154]  The question is, why is the federal government leaving our borders for us for anybody to come in anywhere they want?
[02:06:12.234 --> 02:06:13.315]  If you knew anything about our borders...
[02:06:18.154 --> 02:06:19.736]  You would know that that's not the case.
[02:06:20.096 --> 02:06:22.379]  Our borders are quite secure.
[02:06:22.419 --> 02:06:25.943]  Thank you.
[02:06:26.304 --> 02:06:27.124]  Back that up.
[02:06:27.165 --> 02:06:27.745]  Back that up.
[02:06:27.785 --> 02:06:28.726]  This is unedited.
[02:06:29.167 --> 02:06:30.609]  Our borders are quite secure.
[02:06:30.629 --> 02:06:31.009]  Thank you.
[02:06:31.369 --> 02:06:36.736]  And notice he talks like a... One of these burnout...
[02:06:38.137 --> 02:06:42.080]  You know, high school teachers who sneaks off at lunch and has a martini lunch.
[02:06:44.121 --> 02:06:54.608]  And he sits there like he's talking to a group of elementary school students, where it isn't about the information, it's about him acting smug and saying, the minute men can go home, can't they?
[02:06:54.668 --> 02:06:56.669]  It's all about how we're trash.
[02:06:56.729 --> 02:07:00.472]  And this is the quintessential fake liberal arrogance.
[02:07:01.212 --> 02:07:05.215]  I mean, you'll sit there and tell them a decade ago, derivatives are going to destroy us, it will destroy our economy.
[02:07:05.655 --> 02:07:07.196]  They're like, the economy's doing great.
[02:07:07.256 --> 02:07:08.998]  Well, shut up, conspiracy theorist.
[02:07:09.498 --> 02:07:14.902]  Bob Chapman hearing that, and for TV viewers that are watching on PrisonPlanet.TV watching that,
[02:07:17.748 --> 02:07:30.230]  That attitude, that spirit, I think, really illustrates everything that we're fighting and is 180 degrees the opposite of what our founders set up as we go into the 4th of July.
[02:07:30.270 --> 02:07:39.632]  I mean, is that guy, I don't just throw the word treason around, is that guy not a treacherous little vermin, this creature, Congressman Pete Stark?
[02:07:39.652 --> 02:07:42.552]  I mean, he needs to be thrown out of office immediately.
[02:07:42.612 --> 02:07:43.193]  Bob Chapman.
[02:07:44.613 --> 02:07:45.633]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[02:07:46.386 --> 02:07:55.269]  Um, and I'm glad he's doing what he's doing, because what he's doing is alienating the American people who know better.
[02:07:55.309 --> 02:08:11.494]  There was a poll taking yesterday and the day before, and people were asked in the survey, uh, how do you feel about the actions by Arizona in regard to illegal aliens and their new rules or laws?
[02:08:12.794 --> 02:08:15.975]  Four percent said they were against what Arizona was doing.
[02:08:17.560 --> 02:08:19.221]  90% said they were for it.
[02:08:20.022 --> 02:08:24.064]  I've never seen any survey that was that staggering.
[02:08:25.285 --> 02:08:39.033]  I know that we saw some votes, indications of how people think when they were polling for the people to see how they felt about the Federal Reserve being audited and investigated.
[02:08:39.073 --> 02:08:43.695]  And the polls ran anywhere from 78 to 82%, which really surprised me.
[02:08:44.115 --> 02:08:44.255]  But 90%
[02:08:45.977 --> 02:08:51.442]  I think the president's going the wrong way on this issue at the wrong time.
[02:08:51.862 --> 02:08:53.483]  This thing could blow up in his face.
[02:08:54.164 --> 02:08:54.905]  Well, I agree.
[02:08:55.025 --> 02:08:57.467]  And he's also involved in a mass hoax.
[02:08:58.307 --> 02:09:06.194]  In his speech, I've got the text of it here in my stack, he said, Latino Hispanic Americans want this and it's the right thing to do.
[02:09:06.334 --> 02:09:09.497]  And then the article in Reuters that had his quotes said, yes,
[02:09:10.017 --> 02:09:12.858]  He's doing this ahead of an election for Hispanic votes.
[02:09:13.398 --> 02:09:17.779]  I've seen polls of 70, 75, 81% of Hispanics who are Americans.
[02:09:18.179 --> 02:09:19.640]  They're as red-blooded as anybody else.
[02:09:19.720 --> 02:09:21.620]  They know Mexico's collapsing.
[02:09:21.660 --> 02:09:24.501]  They know the Southwest is uninhabitable on the border.
[02:09:24.961 --> 02:09:27.202]  They know the illegal aliens are driving down the wages.
[02:09:27.582 --> 02:09:28.902]  We don't hate the illegal aliens.
[02:09:29.262 --> 02:09:32.184]  We just know they're being used as a political weapon to bring down this country.
[02:09:32.404 --> 02:09:34.785]  They know 46 states are on the verge of going bankrupt.
[02:09:35.006 --> 02:09:45.832]  They know Schwarzenegger just told 200 plus thousand employees they're gonna have to get minimum wage and have their wages cut from 20 bucks an hour, which you can barely live on in California in many areas, down to six dollars an hour.
[02:09:46.152 --> 02:09:47.453]  They know we're bankrupt, folks!
[02:09:47.493 --> 02:09:48.154]  We're sinking!
[02:09:48.174 --> 02:09:51.235]  We're a lifeboat piled up with the welfare state.
[02:09:52.456 --> 02:09:58.180]  I mean, it is insane to see this guy say there's no border problem, the border is quite secure.
[02:09:58.880 --> 02:10:00.221]  When it is bedlam.
[02:10:00.641 --> 02:10:02.222]  I mean, folks, it is bedlam.
[02:10:03.143 --> 02:10:06.705]  One-third of Arizona is now denied to law enforcement.
[02:10:06.905 --> 02:10:10.147]  They have signs up on highways and national parks saying, don't go in.
[02:10:10.167 --> 02:10:15.451]  I mean, every week people have their farms burned down and ranchers are being killed.
[02:10:15.731 --> 02:10:21.175]  There is a La Reconquista La Invasora going on and it is a nightmare.
[02:10:21.195 --> 02:10:22.596]  I mean, Bob, I know I'm ranting here.
[02:10:22.676 --> 02:10:25.698]  I just cannot believe how crazy this is.
[02:10:27.250 --> 02:10:30.234]  Well, you should be, and you should say what you're saying.
[02:10:30.955 --> 02:10:37.525]  And if I'm not mistaken, didn't we have in the last day or two on the Mexican side of the border?
[02:10:38.486 --> 02:10:44.432]  A large gunfight between two warring cartels where a number of people were killed?
[02:10:44.512 --> 02:10:46.053]  No, the cops are being killed.
[02:10:46.254 --> 02:10:47.094]  It's ongoing.
[02:10:47.435 --> 02:10:50.798]  But I mean, the issue is the majority of Hispanics want the borders shut.
[02:10:50.838 --> 02:10:55.582]  The media runs this hoax that it's racist if you want to have a border when every other country has one.
[02:10:55.782 --> 02:10:56.483]  It's racist.
[02:10:56.543 --> 02:10:58.525]  It's like, you don't want health care run by the government?
[02:10:59.065 --> 02:11:00.727]  Raise your taxes, cut the benefits?
[02:11:01.047 --> 02:11:01.768]  You're racist!
[02:11:02.148 --> 02:11:03.509]  You don't want to have war with Iran?
[02:11:03.549 --> 02:11:04.170]  You're racist!
[02:11:04.490 --> 02:11:05.911]  You don't want to give up all your property?
[02:11:05.971 --> 02:11:06.392]  Racist!
[02:11:06.412 --> 02:11:07.493]  You don't want your taxes raised?
[02:11:07.913 --> 02:11:08.754]  I mean, racist?
[02:11:08.814 --> 02:11:11.837]  What in Hades does that have to do with it?
[02:11:12.197 --> 02:11:19.083]  That little establishment knuckle-dragger, slimeball Chris Matthews, knows full well what he's doing when he invokes racism.
[02:11:19.423 --> 02:11:20.764]  He is a race pimp.
[02:11:20.865 --> 02:11:21.925]  He is the racist.
[02:11:23.807 --> 02:11:24.528]  And that's true.
[02:11:24.828 --> 02:11:28.171]  And that's why he does that, is because he gets paid to do it.
[02:11:28.587 --> 02:11:34.113]  And there's too many people in the world like that, and there's nothing we can do about harnessing people like that.
[02:11:34.673 --> 02:11:40.960]  But I hope Stark continues to shoot his mouth off and be the arrogant little puke that he is.
[02:11:41.601 --> 02:11:45.485]  It's very important, because he just alienates more and more people.
[02:11:46.166 --> 02:11:50.210]  And they gotta go to the polls, and he's no longer gonna be a congressman.
[02:11:50.814 --> 02:11:55.316]  And there's going to be a lot of people who are going to be, we'll call it, diselected.
[02:11:55.457 --> 02:11:56.977]  They're so arrogant though.
[02:11:56.997 --> 02:11:59.439]  They're like on... I don't understand power trips.
[02:11:59.719 --> 02:12:00.679]  I just don't understand it.
[02:12:00.739 --> 02:12:03.181]  I mean, I had a power trip when I was 18 years old.
[02:12:03.501 --> 02:12:07.543]  As I've actually gotten power, I've been freaked out by it and realized the responsibility.
[02:12:07.803 --> 02:12:14.807]  Who are these people that just... I mean, I would be embarrassed to have red carpets and marching bands and everyone kissing my rump.
[02:12:14.827 --> 02:12:15.848]  They just love it though, Bob.
[02:12:17.088 --> 02:12:18.369]  Well, there's some people that do.
[02:12:19.205 --> 02:12:22.607]  And it all ends up at some bad end.
[02:12:23.848 --> 02:12:29.511]  Even Cicero ended up badly, as powerful and as talented as he was.
[02:12:30.211 --> 02:12:36.315]  And so, all men, and we'll just use men, have clay feet.
[02:12:37.015 --> 02:12:38.196]  And they don't realize it.
[02:12:38.816 --> 02:12:46.521]  And your comment about the responsibility that goes along with the things that you and I do is extraordinarily
[02:12:47.270 --> 02:12:48.051]  Succinct.
[02:12:48.171 --> 02:13:02.561]  It's very important that you realize that, and people in the position that you and I are in, that we have a great responsibility and burden to carry, which we have voluntarily assumed.
[02:13:03.521 --> 02:13:16.350]  And I think that's very, very important, and it bears out why we insist on telling the truth and turning over every stone so that we can find any skullduggery that's going on.
[02:13:17.383 --> 02:13:32.557]  Sometimes I think my publication, The International Forecaster, should be renamed The Financial Inquirer, because if you want to really know what's going on around the world, it's important in the realm of skullduggery, we cover it.
[02:13:33.217 --> 02:13:43.907]  But these people, when they use this arrogance, and we'll capsulize it within that word, all they're doing
[02:13:44.537 --> 02:13:49.179]  Is bringing more trouble down upon their heads and it's going to bury them.
[02:13:49.379 --> 02:13:58.443]  Well, I mean, it enrages me to watch Obama playing golf every day, to have read about Bush taking two naps and working out for three hours a day.
[02:13:58.463 --> 02:14:06.307]  I mean, I feel like with the responsibility I have, I catch myself working 10, 12, 13, 14, 18, sometimes 24 hours not sleeping.
[02:14:06.327 --> 02:14:09.028]  I had to quit that a few years ago.
[02:14:09.068 --> 02:14:10.369]  It was so bad for me physically.
[02:14:11.149 --> 02:14:34.606]  You know, to work 24 hours straight all the time, I mean routinely, but I feel like a responsible, I feel guilty when I'm not fighting these people because I know how serious it is and to watch them having these concerts at the White House and the BP guys sailing his yacht and just to see how they enjoy it and they laugh at the public and they just are sacks of
[02:14:36.161 --> 02:14:44.967]  Ugh, they make me... I mean, I just... Why is it, Bob, that in history, the arrogant, power-lusting trash almost always takes control?
[02:14:45.007 --> 02:14:50.431]  I mean, why can't we just grow up as a society and take care of these people?
[02:14:50.831 --> 02:14:53.333]  I mean, why can't we get our business together?
[02:14:54.574 --> 02:14:57.316]  It's the evolutionary process of man.
[02:14:58.196 --> 02:15:04.681]  And you have a great middle among humanity, and then you have the good guys and the bad guys.
[02:15:05.510 --> 02:15:07.732]  And their eternal fight goes on forever.
[02:15:08.593 --> 02:15:10.475]  And this is nothing new, you know that.
[02:15:11.096 --> 02:15:14.720]  And what's going to happen is we're going to go head-to-head all the way.
[02:15:15.480 --> 02:15:16.281]  And good will win.
[02:15:16.602 --> 02:15:17.463]  We will win.
[02:15:17.943 --> 02:15:19.845]  There's no way we're not going to win.
[02:15:20.706 --> 02:15:23.309]  What the price is we have to pay, it's irrelevant.
[02:15:24.091 --> 02:15:25.172]  Absolutely irrelevant.
[02:15:25.212 --> 02:15:30.537]  And I guess life really is about that journey and which side you choose to be a part of, good or evil.
[02:15:30.957 --> 02:15:33.659]  And the Bible says you were hot or cold, I spit you out of my mouth.
[02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:40.105]  So many people are good at their core, they want to be good people, but they choose to sit on the fence.
[02:15:40.545 --> 02:15:43.708]  And sitting on the fence means you've made the decision to join evil.
[02:15:44.188 --> 02:15:45.869]  And so I'll tell you, if you're going to sit on the fence,
[02:15:46.650 --> 02:15:49.614]  And just kind of, oh, they're conspiracy theorists, oh, it's not that bad.
[02:15:50.074 --> 02:15:56.081]  You might as well go out and start robbing banks, or I'm not saying, you know, literally, but join the New World Order.
[02:15:56.601 --> 02:16:00.866]  Because, you know, I mean, if you're going to go to hell, you might as well try to be a general.
[02:16:00.886 --> 02:16:04.671]  I mean, you might as well, you know, try to go all the way to the head of the line here.
[02:16:05.745 --> 02:16:11.228]  I mean, you people out there who think you can sit in the middle of the road, that's where the roadkill is, is the middle of the road.
[02:16:11.748 --> 02:16:13.669]  You need to choose a side, folks.
[02:16:13.729 --> 02:16:15.930]  You need to choose a side now.
[02:16:16.390 --> 02:16:18.951]  It is essential that you realize that you're not a spectator.
[02:16:19.311 --> 02:16:21.573]  Life is not a spectator sport, it's been said many times.
[02:16:22.053 --> 02:16:23.313]  It is not a spectator sport.
[02:16:23.593 --> 02:16:27.335]  And so many of you are unfulfilled and unhappy because you are spectators.
[02:16:30.382 --> 02:16:31.363]  You don't have rudders.
[02:16:31.943 --> 02:16:35.006]  And so many of you have the talents and the gifts God gave you.
[02:16:35.026 --> 02:16:36.467]  You're not using it.
[02:16:36.707 --> 02:16:37.928]  You need to use it.
[02:16:39.009 --> 02:16:40.550]  Any comments on that statement, Bob Chapman?
[02:16:40.570 --> 02:16:42.151]  We're going to come back with two segments of calls.
[02:16:43.412 --> 02:16:45.433]  Well, again, you're absolutely right.
[02:16:46.114 --> 02:16:51.558]  And it's up to us to motivate people to understand and want to participate.
[02:16:52.419 --> 02:16:57.683]  And the kind of people you're talking about have always been with civilization.
[02:16:58.463 --> 02:16:59.624]  God made us all different.
[02:17:00.450 --> 02:17:03.491]  And we all have our limits to what we can do as well.
[02:17:04.411 --> 02:17:13.193]  And there are people who recognize that the part that they could do might be very small, and they say, well, what the heck, I won't do that.
[02:17:13.653 --> 02:17:16.954]  But it's important everybody get behind us, because we've got them on the run.
[02:17:17.754 --> 02:17:27.016]  Believe me, the only reason they're starting that war over there in the Middle East is to deflect and keep people's minds someplace else.
[02:17:27.461 --> 02:17:34.023]  Worrying about whether there's going to be a draft, and the kids are going to come over and get murdered, and a whole bunch of Muslim kids are going to get murdered.
[02:17:34.603 --> 02:17:35.663]  That's what they're worried about.
[02:17:36.083 --> 02:17:40.364]  And the fear of the economy and the finance are going to pass.
[02:17:40.884 --> 02:17:42.064]  It's not going to be important.
[02:17:42.845 --> 02:17:47.286]  You know, I once said to an Israeli, the economy's not doing very well.
[02:17:47.586 --> 02:17:49.366]  And he says to me, I don't worry about that.
[02:17:49.386 --> 02:17:50.426]  I might be dead tomorrow.
[02:17:51.307 --> 02:17:52.127]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:52.147 --> 02:17:52.767]  Stay with us.
[02:17:53.067 --> 02:17:56.268]  Bob Chapman, your call straight ahead, TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:17:58.274 --> 02:17:59.254]  Who is Sam Andy?
[02:17:59.595 --> 02:18:01.935]  Sam Andy Foods is life insurance in a can.
[02:18:02.116 --> 02:18:03.596]  Life insurance you can eat.
[02:18:03.756 --> 02:18:08.098]  Sam Andy Foods has been serving loyal customers worldwide for over 50 years.
[02:18:08.278 --> 02:18:08.998]  Why so long?
[02:18:09.318 --> 02:18:09.698]  Simple.
[02:18:09.879 --> 02:18:13.540]  Sam Andy Foods have perfected the taste and quality of low-moisture foods.
[02:18:13.700 --> 02:18:16.161]  Foods that last 15 to 25 years.
[02:18:16.341 --> 02:18:21.103]  And that's made us an industry leader among families, sportsmen, outdoorsmen, churches, schools,
[02:18:21.243 --> 02:18:23.044]  People living in remote areas, U.S.
[02:18:23.084 --> 02:18:24.966]  troops in wartime, and many others.
[02:18:25.226 --> 02:18:33.032]  Sam Andy is America's leading supplier of over 100 high-quality, low-moisture products and everything you need to survive in any emergency.

[02:18:44.801 --> 02:18:47.864]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:19:02.881 --> 02:19:03.642]  What have we got?
[02:19:03.862 --> 02:19:05.983]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:19:06.324 --> 02:19:07.024]  A republic.
[02:19:07.324 --> 02:19:09.886]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:19:09.966 --> 02:19:11.888]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:19:12.228 --> 02:19:14.130]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:19:14.250 --> 02:19:15.531]  So they think they own our land?
[02:19:15.931 --> 02:19:17.052]  They think they own our water?
[02:19:17.252 --> 02:19:17.652]  Children?
[02:19:17.853 --> 02:19:18.653]  Our education?
[02:19:18.973 --> 02:19:19.594]  Our money?
[02:19:19.814 --> 02:19:23.477]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:19:23.837 --> 02:19:28.483]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:19:28.803 --> 02:19:29.624]  We have the facts.
[02:19:29.824 --> 02:19:30.945]  We have the Constitution.
[02:19:30.985 --> 02:19:31.867]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:19:31.887 --> 02:19:32.728]  We have common law.
[02:19:32.788 --> 02:19:35.030]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:19:35.311 --> 02:19:39.075]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:19:39.175 --> 02:19:43.977]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:19:44.137 --> 02:19:45.497]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:19:45.637 --> 02:19:46.478]  Don't tread on me.
[02:19:46.718 --> 02:19:53.160]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:19:58.089 --> 02:20:01.011]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[02:20:01.091 --> 02:20:03.032]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[02:20:03.152 --> 02:20:05.814]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[02:20:05.914 --> 02:20:07.855]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[02:20:08.136 --> 02:20:09.316]  Okay, here it comes.
[02:20:09.536 --> 02:20:11.418]  But first, the facts.
[02:20:11.438 --> 02:20:13.159]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[02:20:13.379 --> 02:20:15.100]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[02:20:15.360 --> 02:20:18.842]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[02:20:19.043 --> 02:20:26.447]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[02:20:26.808 --> 02:20:27.408]  Sinofresh.

[02:20:47.033 --> 02:20:47.373]  Mention GCN.

[02:20:48.334 --> 02:20:48.694]  It works!
[02:21:14.941 --> 02:21:31.116]  We are going to kick the butt of the New World Order together if you realize you're part of this victory.
[02:21:31.516 --> 02:21:34.739]  To join the second revolution to restore the republic.
[02:21:35.500 --> 02:21:37.682]  Join us and come in and be part of the big win.
[02:21:38.523 --> 02:21:39.464]  I'm not rolling over.
[02:21:41.109 --> 02:21:45.273]  Losing is not in the cards if you take action.
[02:21:46.114 --> 02:21:48.637]  And even if we were going to lose, I'm not rolling over and licking boots.
[02:21:48.677 --> 02:21:50.739]  Bob Chapman's our guest for this segment and the next.
[02:21:50.779 --> 02:21:56.084]  We have an amazing filmmaker, the maker of the quintessential film, The Money Masters.
[02:21:56.625 --> 02:22:00.769]  That'll be 14, 15 years ago, about the entire history of the Federal Reserve, the New World Order.
[02:22:01.350 --> 02:22:02.271]  I learned so much from this.
[02:22:02.311 --> 02:22:03.031]  He's made a new film!
[02:22:03.872 --> 02:22:07.773]  It's been 14 years, and it's out, and it's available at InfoWars.com.
[02:22:07.873 --> 02:22:13.035]  You can get 25% off the Money Masters when you get the new film with it.
[02:22:13.795 --> 02:22:15.396]  But go into your phone calls.
[02:22:16.056 --> 02:22:19.137]  Brian in Montreal and Mike Joss in Black Patriot.
[02:22:19.177 --> 02:22:21.478]  We'll have time for those four at least in this segment and the next.
[02:22:21.498 --> 02:22:22.478]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[02:22:22.518 --> 02:22:22.858]  Go ahead.
[02:22:23.578 --> 02:22:24.019]  Hi, guys.
[02:22:24.139 --> 02:22:31.401]  I was just curious what you guys thought about the Jerry Cain case, because I know that you published that on my birthday, the 21st of May.
[02:22:32.037 --> 02:22:38.925]  I had received an email probably a few days before saying that they were just illegal drug dealers from Mexico who got shot.
[02:22:39.525 --> 02:22:48.135]  But recently on my site, 12160.org, KLC put up another story about it, and today we have a troll coming on trying to tell us that
[02:22:48.988 --> 02:22:54.972]  Jerry and his son were actually bad guys trying to kill those cops and we all misunderstand what's going on out there.
[02:22:55.153 --> 02:22:57.995]  Okay, well I remember you're talking about the kid getting shot on the border?
[02:22:58.015 --> 02:22:58.715]  Yes.
[02:22:59.035 --> 02:23:00.897]  Well, I mean, any death is terrible.
[02:23:02.438 --> 02:23:13.706]  And when cops come in and tase her, some old woman strapped down in her gurney who's 86 years old because she yells at him because he's having organ failure and is delirious, or when cops beat up an autistic kid, I get angry.
[02:23:14.066 --> 02:23:15.888]  But when you're in a war zone on the border,
[02:23:16.488 --> 02:23:20.071]  With Mexican troops and grenade attacks and death.
[02:23:20.592 --> 02:23:27.778]  You know, whenever the Mexican troops or the coyotes kill a whole bunch of poor Hispanics, it's never even in the national news.
[02:23:27.818 --> 02:23:28.578]  It's local news.
[02:23:29.079 --> 02:23:29.960]  But then the cops...
[02:23:31.808 --> 02:23:36.591]  You know, shoot this teenager, and it becomes this big thing, oh, we gotta get rid of the border.
[02:23:37.032 --> 02:23:38.813]  And so what I'm saying is that's propaganda.
[02:23:39.193 --> 02:23:44.497]  It should be investigated, but I've seen a lot of conflicting stories, and I don't believe anything that comes out of the federales.
[02:23:44.517 --> 02:23:49.441]  I don't believe anything that comes out of our police either, but, I mean, the federales are clearly even worse on average.
[02:23:50.202 --> 02:23:53.804]  And I've looked at the case some, but I don't know what the truth is.
[02:23:54.505 --> 02:23:59.409]  I'm just saying that that's a war zone down there, going back and forth across that border.
[02:24:00.209 --> 02:24:02.532]  And when a cop gets killed down there, you never hear about it.
[02:24:02.772 --> 02:24:04.453]  Bob Shavin, what's your take on that case?
[02:24:05.454 --> 02:24:07.757]  Well, I think you're absolutely right again on this one.
[02:24:08.558 --> 02:24:16.666]  And the police in Mexico are corrupt, as is the military, and it's a matter of historical record.
[02:24:17.647 --> 02:24:18.448]  It's in the open.
[02:24:21.150 --> 02:24:22.712]  Anybody who says anything
[02:24:23.337 --> 02:24:24.298]  About what they're doing.
[02:24:25.158 --> 02:24:27.760]  They're told to shut up or they'll get liquidated.
[02:24:27.780 --> 02:24:31.942]  Well my issue is they claim that our police killed the kid in cold blood, the teenager.
[02:24:31.962 --> 02:24:39.027]  And my issue is that it's wrong and I mean our police are certainly capable of killing innocent people.
[02:24:39.127 --> 02:24:41.889]  I mean this is what goes on when you militarize police.
[02:24:42.209 --> 02:24:43.790]  I don't know what to say about that case.
[02:24:43.810 --> 02:24:44.790]  So caller, what do you think?
[02:24:44.830 --> 02:24:45.451]  I mean I don't know.
[02:24:46.383 --> 02:24:59.694]  Well, the information that I had gotten was that Jerry and his son were teaching people about how to walk away from the banks and the NWO propaganda, and that they were set up in Arkansas, and that it was a military sniper that had fired behind the police.
[02:24:59.714 --> 02:25:00.114]  Wait, wait, wait.
[02:25:00.134 --> 02:25:01.956]  You're talking about a totally different case.
[02:25:01.976 --> 02:25:04.898]  You're talking about that white van getting shot up in Arkansas.
[02:25:05.278 --> 02:25:09.542]  For some reason, I thought you were talking about the Hispanic teenager that got shot on the border.
[02:25:10.402 --> 02:25:10.763]  No, no, no.
[02:25:10.803 --> 02:25:14.105]  They were doing that, and that's very suspicious, that whole shootout and the rest of it.
[02:25:14.426 --> 02:25:14.906]  I'm sorry.
[02:25:16.267 --> 02:25:21.111]  I misheard what you were saying, Brian, so we'll have to talk more about that on another broadcast.
[02:25:21.651 --> 02:25:23.332]  Kurt Nimmo did write a story about that.
[02:25:23.392 --> 02:25:24.453]  He's really the expert on it.
[02:25:24.473 --> 02:25:28.756]  I mean, there's so much info, folks, I can't keep track of it all, I'm going to be honest with you.
[02:25:29.036 --> 02:25:31.938]  We're going to try to jam in Black Patriot Josh and Mike.
[02:25:32.419 --> 02:25:36.542]  As soon as we come out of break, in 70 seconds, the fourth hour is about to start.
[02:25:39.664 --> 02:25:41.705]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:25:42.266 --> 02:25:44.667]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:25:49.192 --> 02:25:52.813]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:25:53.153 --> 02:26:01.275]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:26:02.015 --> 02:26:06.056]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:26:06.636 --> 02:26:17.458]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:26:18.098 --> 02:26:27.100]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:26:27.600 --> 02:26:32.641]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:26:33.042 --> 02:26:40.223]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:26:40.523 --> 02:26:43.284]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:26:50.259 --> 02:26:52.161]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:26:52.641 --> 02:26:55.583]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:27:01.008 --> 02:27:05.031]  Alright my friends, it's the fourth and final hour, our last segment with Bob Chaffin.
[02:27:05.051 --> 02:27:06.612]  Go on your phone calls right now.
[02:27:06.632 --> 02:27:10.035]  Black Patriot in New York, you're on the air, welcome.
[02:27:11.125 --> 02:27:12.986]  Yes, hi Alex, hi Bob Chapman.
[02:27:13.006 --> 02:27:29.510]  Hi, I just graduated from high school, and I just want to say that I've been listening to you Alex for like two years now, and I've been working for probably four years, but yes, and I've listened to a lot of stuff that you and Bob Chapman said, and it has helped me a lot, especially in school.
[02:27:30.010 --> 02:27:32.111]  We just took a, I mean probably like a month ago,
[02:27:32.871 --> 02:27:36.774]  A National Financial Literacy Test, and I got like a 90% on it.
[02:27:36.854 --> 02:27:48.023]  Even though I know some of the stuff that was on it, I had to put what I thought that they would say, like about the Federal Reserve, what it is for, and all that stuff.
[02:27:49.004 --> 02:27:59.912]  But like, I just wanted to say that, um, like, Alex, a lot of people who are black, a lot of what you're talking about, they're talking about that too.
[02:27:59.933 --> 02:28:01.614]  Especially in the hood over here.
[02:28:02.208 --> 02:28:03.589]  We know all about all that stuff.
[02:28:03.749 --> 02:28:05.510]  That's what me and my friend, we talk about that all the time.
[02:28:05.550 --> 02:28:06.931]  The Federal Reserve and so on.
[02:28:06.951 --> 02:28:11.794]  We also talk about other stuff like the Bule Group, which is a traitor to the black people.
[02:28:13.055 --> 02:28:19.779]  And you know, I'm just very happy about what you and Bob Chapman put out there for us every day.
[02:28:21.118 --> 02:28:22.518]  Well, God bless you, Black Patriot.
[02:28:22.538 --> 02:28:23.299]  Good to hear from you.
[02:28:24.099 --> 02:28:29.060]  Bob, we've always had a huge African-American listenership.
[02:28:29.220 --> 02:28:29.560]  African.
[02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:30.560]  We have people in Africa.
[02:28:31.321 --> 02:28:34.481]  In some African countries, we're even higher rated than we are in the U.S.
[02:28:34.941 --> 02:28:35.562]  on Alexa.
[02:28:37.242 --> 02:28:41.223]  And so the awakening is really accelerating out there in the black community.
[02:28:42.743 --> 02:28:43.924]  And I think you're absolutely right.
[02:28:43.944 --> 02:28:47.685]  I've gone on several times on WVOM.
[02:28:47.985 --> 02:28:49.325]  I think it is in Chicago.
[02:28:50.037 --> 02:28:56.900]  Which is, uh, I guess the largest, uh, uh, Black Station, City of the Jackson, and Mr. Butler.
[02:28:57.620 --> 02:29:07.944]  And I was amazed at what these people... I had three women in a row call the last time I was on and asked me about the Illuminati, and they really knew about it.
[02:29:08.364 --> 02:29:13.346]  And so what the young man is saying is absolutely true, and we love you all, we want you to listen.
[02:29:13.886 --> 02:29:14.426]  Absolutely.
[02:29:14.466 --> 02:29:15.207]  No, it's exciting.
[02:29:15.287 --> 02:29:20.650]  On average, when I've been on black stations, their callers are much more informed than kind of mainline audiences.
[02:29:20.690 --> 02:29:21.511]  But that's changing.
[02:29:21.531 --> 02:29:24.052]  We want everybody to know what's going on.
[02:29:25.253 --> 02:29:29.496]  But see, black folks aren't as naive as some people who think they're part of the establishment.
[02:29:29.876 --> 02:29:34.278]  I run into so many people who think just because they're white, they're going to be protected.
[02:29:34.619 --> 02:29:35.639]  That's not how this works.
[02:29:36.060 --> 02:29:38.261]  Mike in California, you're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[02:29:38.301 --> 02:29:38.621]  Go ahead.
[02:29:40.382 --> 02:29:41.363]  How's your day, Mr. Jones?
[02:29:41.543 --> 02:29:41.763]  Good.
[02:29:41.803 --> 02:29:42.443]  Good to talk to you.
[02:29:42.483 --> 02:29:43.044]  What's on your mind?
[02:29:44.006 --> 02:29:48.068]  I got a couple of comments and then two that I think are important questions.
[02:29:48.088 --> 02:29:50.409]  Sure thing.
[02:29:51.029 --> 02:29:54.771]  The word inalienable doesn't seem to be used by much by anybody except you.
[02:29:55.451 --> 02:30:02.234]  These flying, evil flying monkeys come to the door saying, hey, we got a new signature from Obama saying we can just drag you off and whatever.
[02:30:02.734 --> 02:30:03.474]  I'm not going to let him.
[02:30:03.554 --> 02:30:09.275]  How do I address him and tell him, no you're not, because I'm going to remove parts of your body and hand them back to you?
[02:30:09.295 --> 02:30:11.436]  Well, inalienable means this is supreme.
[02:30:11.536 --> 02:30:12.736]  No one can change this.
[02:30:12.796 --> 02:30:16.277]  This predates the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:30:16.337 --> 02:30:17.577]  It only points that out.
[02:30:18.277 --> 02:30:24.739]  And you cross this line, you cross in the line of tyrants, and it's not just my right, it's my duty as the Declaration of Independence.
[02:30:24.759 --> 02:30:26.499]  It's what July 4th's about, folks.
[02:30:26.939 --> 02:30:29.280]  Says it's my duty to stop you.
[02:30:30.137 --> 02:30:31.697]  Now they're gonna call that terrorism.
[02:30:32.137 --> 02:30:38.099]  It's our job to reach out to the police, who are just like the public, they're dumber than dirt, and to inform them.
[02:30:38.139 --> 02:30:38.739]  Bob Chapman.
[02:30:40.599 --> 02:30:40.999]  I agree.
[02:30:41.739 --> 02:30:46.980]  And I think that informing, informing, informing is what this is all about.
[02:30:47.040 --> 02:30:48.201]  And that's why we're on here.
[02:30:48.621 --> 02:30:55.522]  To give everybody a voice that we can, and update everybody about what's going on and what's important and what you gotta know.
[02:30:56.621 --> 02:30:58.122]  Now, this is serious stuff, folks.
[02:30:58.142 --> 02:31:01.625]  You've heard us lay it all out for decades, Bob, for 40-something years.
[02:31:01.965 --> 02:31:07.529]  It's all coming true, exactly like we said it would, because we're reading the enemy's playbook.
[02:31:08.209 --> 02:31:09.490]  I mean, it's very elementary.
[02:31:09.690 --> 02:31:10.351]  Anything else, Mike?
[02:31:11.089 --> 02:31:14.192]  Yes sir, two couple quick things, I'll get through, I'll scamper on them.
[02:31:14.712 --> 02:31:20.157]  A guy recommending World Prayer to disrupt their functions and systems, I think is a real good idea.
[02:31:20.197 --> 02:31:22.759]  I pray every damn night for these, to beat these monkeys.
[02:31:23.179 --> 02:31:29.564]  The other two questions are, how do they identify what foods are GMO foods, since this is kind of a big eating week.
[02:31:29.805 --> 02:31:33.328]  Well that's a great question, I'm going to have to cover that later in the hour, I'm going to write a note on that.
[02:31:34.406 --> 02:31:40.169]  And we're going to get to Josh and everybody else, but that's a very big issue and I appreciate your call.
[02:31:41.250 --> 02:31:43.311]  Bob Chapman, hopefully I'll see you next week.
[02:31:44.132 --> 02:31:47.113]  Lord willing, we're both still here and it's always great to have you on.
[02:31:47.133 --> 02:31:47.954]  We'll talk to you next week.
[02:31:49.144 --> 02:31:51.205]  Thank you very much and thank you all for listening.
[02:31:51.525 --> 02:31:52.125]  Thank you, Bob.
[02:31:52.145 --> 02:31:55.487]  All right, we'll be back for the balance of the broadcast.
[02:31:55.507 --> 02:31:57.247]  52 minutes left in transmission.
[02:31:57.327 --> 02:32:01.329]  Alex Jones here with urgent information concerning TrendsResearch.com.
[02:32:01.789 --> 02:32:08.712]  The Trends Journal distills the voluminous ongoing research of the Trends Research Institute into a concise, readily accessible form.
[02:32:09.272 --> 02:32:12.714]  By tracking 300 separately defined domestic and international trends,
[02:32:13.314 --> 02:32:17.616]  The Trends Journal establishes the connections that others fail to see or misinterpret.
[02:32:17.836 --> 02:32:25.038]  Gerald Salente's Trends Journal allows you to anticipate change, recognize the implications, and take protective strategies.
[02:32:25.698 --> 02:32:30.420]  Individual readers from every walk of life can put the Trends Journal Trends Forecast
[02:32:30.720 --> 02:32:31.180]  I think so.
[02:32:57.059 --> 02:33:01.281]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:33:01.601 --> 02:33:02.201]  Number 1.
[02:33:02.522 --> 02:33:05.683]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:33:05.943 --> 02:33:06.503]  Number 2.
[02:33:06.803 --> 02:33:11.286]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:33:11.626 --> 02:33:12.066]  It's true.
[02:33:12.366 --> 02:33:16.928]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:33:17.228 --> 02:33:17.788]  Number 3.
[02:33:18.069 --> 02:33:21.350]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:33:21.650 --> 02:33:25.352]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:33:25.552 --> 02:33:26.112]  Number 4.
[02:33:26.352 --> 02:33:28.713]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:33:29.113 --> 02:33:32.493]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:33:32.793 --> 02:33:33.313]  Number 5.
[02:33:33.573 --> 02:33:37.494]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:33:37.714 --> 02:33:42.495]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:33:42.775 --> 02:33:46.796]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:33:46.956 --> 02:33:48.496]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:33:54.597 --> 02:34:00.781]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:34:01.001 --> 02:34:07.044]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:34:07.404 --> 02:34:14.508]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:34:14.788 --> 02:34:19.390]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:34:22.452 --> 02:34:24.896]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:34:39.336 --> 02:34:42.761]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:34:43.241 --> 02:34:48.948]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[02:34:48.988 --> 02:34:49.228]  Thank you!
[02:34:59.235 --> 02:35:05.258]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:35:05.858 --> 02:35:08.920]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:35:16.164 --> 02:35:19.646]  Well, for the next 52 minutes, we're joined by Bill Still.
[02:35:21.050 --> 02:35:22.731]  I remember I was already awake.
[02:35:22.751 --> 02:35:23.952]  I knew what was going on.
[02:35:23.992 --> 02:35:26.133]  I'd been on the air about two years.
[02:35:26.933 --> 02:35:34.417]  And I saw the documentary film, The Money Masters, and we played clips on it over and over again on my radio show and my local access television show.
[02:35:34.477 --> 02:35:37.739]  I started out here in Austin, and we sell the film.
[02:35:37.799 --> 02:35:38.919]  It's over three hours long.
[02:35:39.280 --> 02:35:44.182]  The Money Masters, how banks create the world's money and use it to take over the planet.
[02:35:44.242 --> 02:35:48.945]  And the banks, by the way, are run by eugenicists, so that's why it's even more dangerous.
[02:35:49.585 --> 02:35:53.486]  That they be stopped because these are maniacal people.
[02:35:54.167 --> 02:35:58.488]  And it is a two DVD set, an incredible film, so important.
[02:35:59.068 --> 02:35:59.608]  Well, guess what?
[02:35:59.668 --> 02:36:04.610]  After all these years, he has made a new documentary, The Secret of Oz.
[02:36:05.290 --> 02:36:10.212]  And he talks about, you know, is The Wizard of Oz really a secret message?
[02:36:11.252 --> 02:36:12.693]  About the banking cartel.
[02:36:12.773 --> 02:36:15.514]  Well, I know it's not a secret message and the film explains that.
[02:36:16.094 --> 02:36:19.995]  Actually, it's a play from the 1890s that exposes.
[02:36:20.155 --> 02:36:21.596]  In fact, I've actually read the original play.
[02:36:21.636 --> 02:36:31.439]  It's very similar to the film but admits it's about the Wizard of Oz and the bankers behind the curtain creating the fraud and getting rid of the gold standard and the Yellow Brick Road.
[02:36:31.940 --> 02:36:38.242]  So the film exposes these scallywags, these Ponzi scheme operators who have now brought us to the point of
[02:36:38.982 --> 02:36:43.682]  World government run by them through their fraud and the devaluation of the dollar.
[02:36:45.134 --> 02:36:55.818]  And so it's important to expose what they've done, but it's also important to expose alternatives to their predatory financial black hole system that is designed to destroy societies.
[02:36:56.579 --> 02:36:57.699]  And this film is incredible.
[02:36:57.839 --> 02:36:59.240]  It just came out on DVD.
[02:36:59.880 --> 02:37:00.540]  We've got it.
[02:37:00.740 --> 02:37:02.681]  It's available at Infowars.com.
[02:37:03.021 --> 02:37:04.042]  The Secret of Oz.
[02:37:04.062 --> 02:37:07.743]  We'll put the shopping cart image up there for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[02:37:08.183 --> 02:37:11.965]  And you can get 25% off the Money Masters when you order it with
[02:37:12.905 --> 02:37:14.826]  The Secret of Oz.
[02:37:15.467 --> 02:37:17.428]  And this film is so well done.
[02:37:17.468 --> 02:37:18.929]  He's such an amazing filmmaker.
[02:37:18.949 --> 02:37:26.633]  He's got so many big heavy hitters in the film explaining it and going on over it like Peter Schiff, Joe Farah.
[02:37:26.793 --> 02:37:27.854]  It's just amazing.
[02:37:28.974 --> 02:37:30.775]  And it has solutions.
[02:37:30.815 --> 02:37:34.356]  So it shows you who the enemy is, what they've done, and the alternative.
[02:37:34.716 --> 02:37:38.718]  And people are now, more than ever, ready for this information.
[02:37:38.758 --> 02:37:40.758]  So get the new film at InfoWars.com.
[02:37:40.999 --> 02:37:45.720]  I want to play the little four-minute trailer, or part of it, to The Secret of Oz.
[02:37:45.740 --> 02:37:49.102]  Then we're going to go to Bill Still, the amazing filmmaker.
[02:37:49.342 --> 02:37:49.742]  Here it is.
[02:37:51.755 --> 02:37:53.717]  What's going on with the American economy?
[02:37:53.798 --> 02:37:59.524]  Foreclosures are everywhere, unemployment is skyrocketing, and it looks like this may only be the beginning.
[02:38:00.245 --> 02:38:01.527]  What can government do?
[02:38:02.008 --> 02:38:05.512]  The sad answer is, under our current monetary system, nothing.
[02:38:05.932 --> 02:38:10.878]  It's not going to get any better until the root cause of the problem is understood and addressed.
[02:38:11.539 --> 02:38:16.143]  There isn't enough stimulus money in the entire world to get us out of this hole.
[02:38:16.723 --> 02:38:22.908]  Well, you can't borrow yourself out of debt no more than, like I said before, you cannot drink yourself sober.
[02:38:23.228 --> 02:38:34.117]  And so we're going to have a massive, massive recession, or let's call it a depression, while the economy rebalances away from a service sector economy towards a good producing economy.
[02:38:34.457 --> 02:38:42.180]  But could it be that all these problems were foreseen a hundred years ago by L. Frank Baum, the author of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz?
[02:38:42.760 --> 02:38:51.524]  Well, the principal and most powerful symbolic reference is, of course, the yellow brick road and the silver slippers.
[02:38:51.844 --> 02:39:01.008]  In the book version of The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy's slippers are made of silver, as opposed to in the film version, where Dorothy's slippers are made of ruby.
[02:39:01.408 --> 02:39:07.430]  You take away the silver slippers on the gold or yellow brick road, and all of the other symbolism tends to be lost.
[02:39:08.251 --> 02:39:12.812]  Well, it's no secret to any American that we're living in very precarious times.
[02:39:13.112 --> 02:39:18.434]  Americans are being robbed blind, and they don't even know who's doing the robbing.
[02:39:18.895 --> 02:39:20.355]  Our government should never go into debt.
[02:39:21.356 --> 02:39:22.716]  It doesn't need to go into debt.
[02:39:22.916 --> 02:39:24.677]  Our government can issue the money it needs.
[02:39:25.233 --> 02:39:35.283]  If nobody in the government, in either party, is looking at solving the debt problem, then the answer is, it's going to go into a depression as far as the eye can see.
[02:39:35.603 --> 02:39:39.888]  We can't get from where we are to where we need to be without a severe depression.
[02:39:39.948 --> 02:39:45.974]  The government's mentality in general seems to be, we'll do what we have to do and we'll worry about paying for it later.
[02:39:47.239 --> 02:39:49.561]  But what you could do is pay for it now.
[02:39:49.901 --> 02:39:52.023]  In other words, you don't have to pay for it later.
[02:39:52.063 --> 02:39:53.444]  You don't have to pay for it with debt.
[02:39:53.944 --> 02:39:55.586]  You can just pay for it with money.
[02:39:56.066 --> 02:39:58.608]  Nobody's even talking about the debt problem as such.
[02:39:58.928 --> 02:40:04.533]  They're talking about the fact that, gee, the bankers aren't making enough money to live in the way that they're accustomed to.
[02:40:05.093 --> 02:40:07.115]  Remember, all this money we're giving them
[02:40:07.475 --> 02:40:08.456]  Is at interest.
[02:40:08.957 --> 02:40:11.639]  Money we are borrowing to give to the banks.
[02:40:11.920 --> 02:40:19.147]  Then these very same banks have the audacity to loan this money back to us at more interest.
[02:40:19.788 --> 02:40:26.295]  In 2009, the interest we paid on the national debt in one year was more than we spent totally on the Iraq War.
[02:40:26.995 --> 02:40:28.297]  This system has got to go.
[02:40:29.793 --> 02:40:31.635]  Why haven't we heard this before?
[02:40:32.376 --> 02:40:37.581]  Because most of the media and Congress are beholding to the big banks for loans.
[02:40:38.442 --> 02:40:42.266]  Yes, Congress still appropriates money, but where do they get it?
[02:40:43.066 --> 02:40:46.710]  Again, what they can't raise from taxes, they borrow from banks.
[02:40:48.731 --> 02:40:54.433]  In 2009, Congress will spend over $4 trillion, but they will have to borrow half of it.
[02:40:55.413 --> 02:41:00.495]  The worst part is, we aren't just giving the money away, we're borrowing it to give it away.
[02:41:01.255 --> 02:41:08.897]  I think we need to reconsider and rethink, perhaps, the very foundations of our economic and monetary system.
[02:41:09.517 --> 02:41:10.999]  You want a new cause to embrace?
[02:41:11.339 --> 02:41:13.281]  You want to do something good for humanity?
[02:41:13.302 --> 02:41:20.950]  How about one simple reform that will fix most of the bad things in this world, like hunger, poverty, disease, and misery?
[02:41:21.531 --> 02:41:23.794]  This is the ultimate civil rights struggle.
[02:41:23.874 --> 02:41:26.376]  Humankind's escape from serfdom.
[02:41:27.799 --> 02:41:32.141]  The solution is the secret that's been hidden from us for over a hundred years.
[02:41:32.341 --> 02:41:34.002]  Alright folks, that's part of the trailer.
[02:41:34.202 --> 02:41:36.924]  It's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:41:36.944 --> 02:41:40.626]  You can get The Secret of Oz or get the Money Masters with it if you'd like.
[02:41:41.406 --> 02:41:42.507]  Again, InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:41:42.567 --> 02:41:43.867]  You can also write to us at P.O.
[02:41:43.887 --> 02:41:44.748]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[02:41:53.172 --> 02:41:56.495]  And remember, just because you've known this for decades doesn't mean others do.
[02:41:56.555 --> 02:42:03.121]  And now the world is falling to these bankers who are able to just take over the planet with all this fiat currency.
[02:42:03.961 --> 02:42:07.664]  This message is the stake that can be driven through their heart.
[02:42:08.605 --> 02:42:11.126]  It literally is the silver bullet that can kill the werewolves.
[02:42:11.266 --> 02:42:24.452]  It is the holy water that will burn Count Dracula's face off if you will get it and get it out to everyone you know and have viewings and give copies to members of Congress and get aggressive.
[02:42:24.952 --> 02:42:28.175]  The Secret of Oz by the amazing filmmaker Bill Still.
[02:42:28.835 --> 02:42:32.798]  And Bill, it is so great to see your work over the last 15 years.
[02:42:33.079 --> 02:42:34.640]  I was going from memory, but you corrected me.
[02:42:34.660 --> 02:42:37.923]  It was 1900 when this original novel came out.
[02:42:38.503 --> 02:42:48.972]  Go over the time period they were having then with the bankers, what the novel itself covers versus the film, and why your new documentary is so important.
[02:42:50.487 --> 02:42:52.248]  Oh gosh, well there's a mouthful.
[02:42:52.789 --> 02:43:09.201]  Al Frank Baum wrote The Wonderful Wizard of Oz in 1900 as a result of the failure of essentially the Greenbacker movement to capture the presidency when William Jennings Bryan ran for president in 1896.
[02:43:12.163 --> 02:43:14.624]  Bob saw that the movement was dying.
[02:43:14.684 --> 02:43:18.566]  He saw that the bankers and their gold money system was winning.
[02:43:19.367 --> 02:43:35.395]  And so he wrote The Wizard of Oz just as he was, as though he was firing a flare up into the night of history, hoping somebody somewhere down the line, generations later, would catch on to what was going on and pick up the banner.
[02:43:35.955 --> 02:43:37.256]  And that's what I've done.
[02:43:39.818 --> 02:43:46.848]  Alex, the inspiration for The Secret of Oz came from you the last time I was on your show.
[02:43:46.948 --> 02:43:48.490]  I had never heard this before.
[02:43:50.473 --> 02:43:51.613]  Wow, I didn't know that.
[02:43:51.673 --> 02:43:53.034]  And so you went and did the research.
[02:43:53.214 --> 02:43:59.855]  And to correct one more thing, I support gold and silver because fiat currencies can be debased.
[02:44:00.715 --> 02:44:04.856]  And at the time, the bankers were using the hoarding of gold to manipulate the market.
[02:44:05.277 --> 02:44:07.597]  So it's not an all or nothing.
[02:44:07.977 --> 02:44:10.678]  You believe in a fiat system issued by Congress.
[02:44:11.218 --> 02:44:14.683]  Which will be able to pay off the debt and truly empower the population.
[02:44:14.983 --> 02:44:26.378]  And I think your system is a great system because now the bankers have hoarded all the gold and once they're done killing the fiat system, if we go back to a gold system, then they'll have the monopoly all over again.
[02:44:27.335 --> 02:44:28.015]  Well, it's funny.
[02:44:28.056 --> 02:44:32.178]  I saw Peter Schiff on TV just yesterday or the day before.
[02:44:32.538 --> 02:44:34.540]  And I love Peter Schiff and Ron Paul.
[02:44:34.560 --> 02:44:38.923]  Let me say that right up front because we agree on 95% of the stuff.
[02:44:38.963 --> 02:44:42.405]  But, you know, I just think they're dead wrong on the whole gold thing.
[02:44:42.825 --> 02:44:51.711]  And Peter Schiff was asked, well, gee, if you believe that gold is the answer, well, then the United States is in great shape because the U.S.
[02:44:51.771 --> 02:44:53.332]  Treasury owns so much gold.
[02:44:53.773 --> 02:44:56.775]  And Peter kind of goes, well, yeah, but it hasn't been
[02:44:57.295 --> 02:44:57.975]  We're good to go.
[02:45:22.537 --> 02:45:29.404]  Well, let's go over the facts and how the monetary system works briefly and where the bankers have taken us, you know, at this point.
[02:45:30.124 --> 02:45:33.307]  And then let's get into the solutions that are in your film.
[02:45:34.048 --> 02:45:40.775]  But I think the allegory of the wonderful Wizard of Oz is the best place to start as your film does.
[02:45:40.795 --> 02:45:43.597]  We're about to go to break, but let's start getting into that right now.
[02:45:43.658 --> 02:45:44.919]  The parallels in the book.
[02:45:46.072 --> 02:45:54.954]  Well, like it said in the trailer, the biggest piece of symbolism is the silver slippers on the yellow brick road.
[02:45:55.574 --> 02:46:08.838]  Dorothy's slippers were only made to be ruby in 1939 when the film was made, because that's when the technicolor process was new, and so they changed the silver slippers, which is what it was in the book,
[02:46:09.418 --> 02:46:10.158]  We're good to go.
[02:46:35.283 --> 02:46:42.105]  Uh, allowed, uh, Dorothy to tread safely on the dangerous yellow brick road.
[02:46:42.665 --> 02:46:44.286]  Uh, the gold money standard.
[02:46:44.326 --> 02:46:45.066]  Alright, stay there.
[02:46:45.086 --> 02:46:47.767]  We're gonna go to the Emerald City, the man behind the curtain.
[02:46:47.787 --> 02:46:49.227]  Uh, all of it.
[02:46:49.707 --> 02:46:50.347]  Straight ahead.
[02:46:50.727 --> 02:46:51.508]  Stay with us, folks.
[02:46:51.548 --> 02:46:52.828]  This is key information.
[02:46:52.848 --> 02:46:54.208]  The Secret of Oz.
[02:46:54.268 --> 02:46:54.829]  Straight ahead.
[02:46:57.990 --> 02:46:59.310]  Don't answer it!

[02:47:56.909 --> 02:48:01.773]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:48:01.873 --> 02:48:02.653]  What have we got?
[02:48:02.873 --> 02:48:04.995]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:48:05.315 --> 02:48:06.056]  A republic.
[02:48:06.336 --> 02:48:08.898]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:48:08.978 --> 02:48:10.879]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:48:11.240 --> 02:48:13.141]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:48:13.261 --> 02:48:14.542]  So they think they own our land?
[02:48:14.942 --> 02:48:16.063]  They think they own our water?
[02:48:16.263 --> 02:48:16.664]  Children?
[02:48:16.884 --> 02:48:17.664]  Our education?
[02:48:18.005 --> 02:48:18.625]  Our money?
[02:48:18.825 --> 02:48:22.468]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:48:22.828 --> 02:48:26.472]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:48:26.512 --> 02:48:27.514]  You are being warned.
[02:48:27.794 --> 02:48:28.635]  We have the facts.
[02:48:28.835 --> 02:48:29.936]  We have the Constitution.
[02:48:29.996 --> 02:48:30.878]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:48:30.898 --> 02:48:31.739]  We have common law.
[02:48:31.779 --> 02:48:34.041]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:34.302 --> 02:48:38.086]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:48:38.186 --> 02:48:42.972]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:48:43.153 --> 02:48:44.514]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:48:44.654 --> 02:48:45.496]  Don't tread on me.
[02:48:45.736 --> 02:48:52.164]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:48:56.843 --> 02:48:59.565]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[02:48:59.785 --> 02:49:03.747]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[02:49:03.767 --> 02:49:06.028]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[02:49:06.208 --> 02:49:11.251]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[02:49:11.391 --> 02:49:13.132]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[02:49:13.192 --> 02:49:14.513]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[02:49:14.733 --> 02:49:16.194]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[02:49:16.234 --> 02:49:19.317]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[02:49:19.597 --> 02:49:24.642]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[02:49:24.982 --> 02:49:34.070]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled Ten Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[02:49:34.310 --> 02:49:34.710]  We're good to go.
[02:49:56.960 --> 02:49:59.562]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:49:59.962 --> 02:50:04.926]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:50:05.286 --> 02:50:07.028]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:50:07.348 --> 02:50:12.152]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:50:12.352 --> 02:50:13.313]  How much do you want?
[02:50:13.533 --> 02:50:14.273]  When do you want it?
[02:50:14.654 --> 02:50:16.255]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:50:16.535 --> 02:50:17.356]  When will you need it?
[02:50:17.616 --> 02:50:19.677]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:50:19.818 --> 02:50:20.918]  Will there be any food?
[02:50:21.159 --> 02:50:22.500]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:50:22.680 --> 02:50:23.040]  If there's a
[02:50:23.080 --> 02:50:25.061]  Quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[02:50:25.202 --> 02:50:27.723]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:50:27.944 --> 02:50:31.126]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:50:31.526 --> 02:50:35.029]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:50:35.329 --> 02:50:36.330]  How much will you need?
[02:50:36.570 --> 02:50:37.191]  We don't know.
[02:50:37.471 --> 02:50:38.391]  How much do you want?
[02:50:38.572 --> 02:50:39.312]  All you can get.
[02:50:39.512 --> 02:50:40.353]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:50:40.613 --> 02:50:43.355]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:50:43.655 --> 02:50:45.397]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com
[02:50:51.181 --> 02:50:51.946]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:51:08.240 --> 02:51:13.985]  If you go back to the founding of this country, they were fighting rational reserve bankers and money manipulators.
[02:51:14.085 --> 02:51:16.227]  Go back to Christ's time, he was fighting the money changers.
[02:51:16.987 --> 02:51:22.672]  Now you go study ancient Chinese history, 3,000 years ago they were having revolts over this, the manipulation of money.
[02:51:24.309 --> 02:51:28.570]  If you look at Abraham Lincoln and before that Andrew Jackson, it was all about the banks.
[02:51:28.930 --> 02:51:31.211]  The Wizard of Oz is about the banks and money.
[02:51:32.071 --> 02:51:39.753]  This is the issue because if you let private groups control your issuance of currency and credit through different manipulations, you will be a slave.
[02:51:40.013 --> 02:51:41.014]  What did Thomas Jefferson say?
[02:51:41.034 --> 02:51:45.735]  Have we ever let private banks and the corporations that grow up around them control the issuance of currency and credit?
[02:51:46.615 --> 02:51:52.877]  Our children will grow up homeless on the continent their forefathers conquered.
[02:51:53.837 --> 02:52:01.721]  This is what we're talking about, and Bill Still, the maker of the new film, The Secret of Oz, he is such an excellent filmmaker, such a great researcher.
[02:52:02.101 --> 02:52:02.581]  Continue.
[02:52:02.601 --> 02:52:06.183]  You've gotten up to the silver slippers on the Yellow Brick Road.
[02:52:06.223 --> 02:52:06.704]  Continue.
[02:52:07.084 --> 02:52:09.045]  Well, let me continue with what you were just saying.
[02:52:09.385 --> 02:52:15.368]  And yet, all of these things throughout history have disappeared from history books.
[02:52:15.948 --> 02:52:18.269]  So you have to ask yourself why.
[02:52:18.709 --> 02:52:25.032]  And the reason is that the banks control so much through loans.
[02:52:25.513 --> 02:52:41.640]  And that's why I have a friend who was just laid off from a major television network and he's so mad at Morgan Bank because it came down to whether this TV network was going to pay the interest on their loans
[02:52:42.040 --> 02:52:48.402]  Or they're going to lay off, like, the top 20 or 30 execs in this TV network, and so they laid off the execs.
[02:52:48.962 --> 02:52:51.943]  So, you know, that's how banks control the media.
[02:52:51.983 --> 02:52:54.144]  They don't necessarily have to own them.
[02:52:54.544 --> 02:53:01.507]  But as long as you're mortgaged out to the max, any business that's mortgaged out to the max can't go against the bankers.
[02:53:01.547 --> 02:53:05.528]  That's why you see, essentially, rule-by-banker in this country right now.
[02:53:05.708 --> 02:53:10.538]  It happened for hundreds of years when farmers would start revolting and speaking out.
[02:53:10.578 --> 02:53:12.181]  The banks would just call their loans.
[02:53:12.987 --> 02:53:21.752]  Which is why it's so amazing that we have, and we'll talk about it later, this wonderful example of a correct banking system with the State Bank of North Dakota.
[02:53:22.413 --> 02:53:26.275]  And, you know, another thing that you said, this is such an important issue.
[02:53:26.335 --> 02:53:30.597]  As I pointed out in the trailer, this is the ultimate civil rights struggle.
[02:53:30.878 --> 02:53:35.340]  This ability of bankers to loan governments money.
[02:53:36.021 --> 02:53:38.242]  The absolute total solution to this
[02:53:38.682 --> 02:53:39.283]  That's right.
[02:53:39.343 --> 02:53:40.124]  That's exactly right.
[02:53:56.203 --> 02:53:57.344]  I mean, let me interrupt.
[02:53:57.404 --> 02:54:02.527]  This is a short segment, a long one coming up, and you can roll with all your great info, but Bill,
[02:54:19.779 --> 02:54:25.261]  Even a lot of our listeners probably go, you mean the government borrows money from bankers?
[02:54:25.301 --> 02:54:27.201]  But it says U.S.
[02:54:27.241 --> 02:54:27.501]  money.
[02:54:27.582 --> 02:54:27.982]  No, it doesn't.
[02:54:28.022 --> 02:54:29.282]  It says Federal Reserve Note.
[02:54:30.462 --> 02:54:34.484]  Well, that's why you always see people saying, oh, the government's printing too much money.
[02:54:34.524 --> 02:54:35.504]  They're not printing it.
[02:54:35.544 --> 02:54:36.524]  They're borrowing it.
[02:54:36.544 --> 02:54:37.765]  That's twice as bad.
[02:54:39.845 --> 02:54:41.266]  Explain that in layman's terms.
[02:54:42.536 --> 02:54:45.159]  The government is not printing money.
[02:54:45.499 --> 02:54:47.721]  It's borrowing money by the issuance of U.S.
[02:54:47.781 --> 02:54:48.121]  bonds.
[02:54:49.823 --> 02:54:53.806]  Every single dollar in your pocket is created as a debt in this country.
[02:54:53.866 --> 02:54:55.388]  It's the debt money system.
[02:54:55.648 --> 02:54:56.869]  That's what they try to hide.
[02:54:56.909 --> 02:55:02.354]  That's why they try to have their politicians continually say, oh, we're going to pay down the national debt.
[02:55:02.854 --> 02:55:03.635]  Impossible.
[02:55:03.915 --> 02:55:04.616]  You cannot possibly
[02:55:04.616 --> 02:55:04.856]  I don't
[02:55:23.945 --> 02:55:24.666]  That's killing us.
[02:55:24.706 --> 02:55:27.288]  And that's what the Constitution says their job is.
[02:55:27.388 --> 02:55:29.830]  Congress shall control the issuance of currency and credit.
[02:55:30.050 --> 02:55:37.517]  But I watched Bernanke before Congress telling Ron Paul, you're not allowed to even know what we're doing because you're not supposed to be involved in it.
[02:55:37.537 --> 02:55:42.521]  I mean, this is completely, 180 degrees, the opposite of the truth.
[02:55:42.921 --> 02:55:50.045]  That's exactly right, and it boils down to a question of whether you want bankers in control or you want Congress in control.
[02:55:50.065 --> 02:55:56.769]  Despite the fact that Congress might be corrupt, et cetera, et cetera, government is all we've got.
[02:55:56.869 --> 02:56:02.392]  It's a blessing from God given us to try to control the banking establishment.
[02:56:02.432 --> 02:56:10.816]  That is the essential thing, the difference between us... Yeah, if we had a real government like Thomas Jefferson, Kennedy tried to block him, they killed him.
[02:56:10.896 --> 02:56:12.137]  I mean, look, look.
[02:56:12.617 --> 02:56:23.102]  You need honest, fair money as the agreed-upon mode of exchange, and then goods and services and ideas are what have the value, instead of this parasite economy waging war against the real economy.
[02:56:23.382 --> 02:56:30.805]  Notice it's the big mega-bankers that fund all the eugenicists and the fake environmentalists, and it's the carbon tax they're going to use to destroy our society.
[02:56:31.166 --> 02:56:33.307]  They are at war against real wealth.
[02:56:33.747 --> 02:56:38.389]  It is a black hole that you mathematically cannot pay back, and that's what your film explains.
[02:56:39.290 --> 02:56:41.793]  These people, it's either us or them, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:42.053 --> 02:56:46.438]  Bill Stills, our guest, Secret of Oz, available on DVD at Infowars.com.
[02:56:46.458 --> 02:56:47.300]  You get it right now.
[02:56:47.860 --> 02:56:48.741]  We're on the march.
[02:56:49.262 --> 02:56:50.844]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:56:51.785 --> 02:56:54.468]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:57:01.272 --> 02:57:02.173]  Tyranny is here.
[02:57:02.533 --> 02:57:06.176]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:57:06.456 --> 02:57:08.678]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:57:08.698 --> 02:57:14.142]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:57:14.562 --> 02:57:20.807]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:57:21.227 --> 02:57:26.750]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:57:27.210 --> 02:57:30.872]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:57:31.372 --> 02:57:35.374]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:57:35.675 --> 02:57:41.177]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:57:41.618 --> 02:57:44.579]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:57:45.180 --> 02:57:46.600]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:57:47.141 --> 02:57:47.581]  It's here.

[02:58:57.199 --> 02:58:59.802]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:59:00.222 --> 02:59:05.187]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:59:05.547 --> 02:59:07.269]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:59:07.589 --> 02:59:12.414]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:59:12.594 --> 02:59:13.555]  How much do you want?
[02:59:13.776 --> 02:59:14.536]  When do you want it?
[02:59:14.897 --> 02:59:16.498]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:59:16.799 --> 02:59:17.619]  When will you need it?
[02:59:17.860 --> 02:59:19.922]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:59:20.062 --> 02:59:21.063]  Will there be any food?
[02:59:21.383 --> 02:59:22.723]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:59:22.903 --> 02:59:27.965]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:59:28.185 --> 02:59:31.346]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:59:31.766 --> 02:59:35.267]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:59:35.587 --> 02:59:36.567]  How much will you need?
[02:59:36.807 --> 02:59:37.427]  We don't know.
[02:59:37.707 --> 02:59:38.627]  How much do you want?
[02:59:38.808 --> 02:59:39.528]  All you can get.
[02:59:39.548 --> 02:59:40.548]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:59:40.788 --> 02:59:41.348]  This is the end
[03:00:12.506 --> 03:00:17.128]  Boy, this is fitting music.
[03:00:17.548 --> 03:00:21.990]  On this 2010 July 4th that's coming up.
[03:00:37.614 --> 03:00:38.694]  We're at the crossroads.
[03:00:38.754 --> 03:00:40.275]  The total end of our republic.
[03:00:41.015 --> 03:00:45.697]  Absolute bondage to offshore, money-changing, corrupt banks.
[03:00:47.257 --> 03:00:51.799]  Being conquered fully and bankrupt as a tool of poverty and control.
[03:00:53.319 --> 03:00:55.860]  Or a crossroads to bring them down and bring them to justice.
[03:00:55.980 --> 03:00:57.701]  And the momentum is starting to turn against them.
[03:00:59.980 --> 03:01:13.691]  I mean, when do you think you'd see my articles being quoted in major Australian newspapers in the Drudge Report, like Dollar Plunge after a UN call to ditch Greenback, replace it with a new global cashless SDR?
[03:01:15.118 --> 03:01:21.364]  Another level of the Ponzi scheme, the film is The Secret of Oz, available at Infowars.com.
[03:01:21.504 --> 03:01:31.715]  You can get a big discount on the Money Masters, the precursor to this film, which is just vital viewing for all, essential viewing, all at Infowars.com.
[03:01:32.015 --> 03:01:33.397]  We have the two shopping carts for you.
[03:01:33.937 --> 03:01:34.838]  I don't think so.
[03:01:50.506 --> 03:02:01.016]  The film that I'm in, that we're carrying, Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic, How to Take the States Back, The Counties, The Sheriffs, How to Peacefully Take Our Nation Back from this Corporate Takeover.
[03:02:01.076 --> 03:02:01.677]  I'm promoting it.
[03:02:02.178 --> 03:02:06.182]  That's also available at Infowars.com or by calling 888-253-3139 or write to us at P.O.
[03:02:06.262 --> 03:02:07.002]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[03:02:16.276 --> 03:02:21.539]  But before we go back to Bill Still, I also want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that made today's radio broadcast possible.
[03:02:22.559 --> 03:02:24.900]  Of course, chief amongst those is FrontSite.com.
[03:02:26.721 --> 03:02:33.545]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot, Dr. Ignatius Piazza, and his top-rated firearms training facility, Frontside Firearms Training?
[03:02:34.085 --> 03:02:35.526]  The website's frontside.com.
[03:02:35.546 --> 03:02:38.668]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[03:02:38.688 --> 03:02:47.673]  And if you act fast, you won't just get five days of world-class gun training with no drill instructor or tough-guy attitude and the 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[03:02:48.493 --> 03:02:53.434]  All for pennies on the dollar, you'll get a free XD caliber pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[03:02:53.994 --> 03:02:56.275]  It's all at FrontSight.com, like the front of your rifle.
[03:02:56.595 --> 03:02:57.995]  FrontSight.com.
[03:02:58.075 --> 03:02:59.756]  Not enough to own guns, you gotta know how to use them.
[03:03:00.076 --> 03:03:00.896]  FrontSight.com.
[03:03:01.356 --> 03:03:06.137]  And then don't forget the wonderful folks, finally, at a Cola Blue, the atmospheric water generator.
[03:03:06.237 --> 03:03:08.958]  They got a bunch of different units, from seven and a half gallons a day.
[03:03:08.998 --> 03:03:11.158]  Looks like a water cooler without the water bottle on top.
[03:03:11.558 --> 03:03:13.439]  Grabs water out of the air, that's what clouds are.
[03:03:13.939 --> 03:03:17.001]  Okay, going back to Bill Still, the maker of The Secret of Oz, if we just let these bankers
[03:03:36.530 --> 03:03:38.693]  Bill, put it this way and then let's get back into the film.
[03:03:39.634 --> 03:03:51.168]  I've read and scanned over and had Ron Paul on yesterday the Banker Reform Act that's passed the House and the Senate, but they have a different version, so it's, they say it's going to pass in the next two weeks.
[03:03:51.208 --> 03:03:53.251]  It's in conference right now for those that just tuned in.
[03:03:54.412 --> 03:04:04.738]  And even the Washington Post admits, but said it was a good thing, that, oh, the Federal Reserve will be given near-complete power and autonomy to take over any financial institutions they want.
[03:04:04.778 --> 03:04:05.978]  There's smaller competition.
[03:04:06.499 --> 03:04:07.879]  State banks, local banks.
[03:04:08.880 --> 03:04:11.561]  And there is $600 trillion in derivatives, and this will fix it.
[03:04:12.862 --> 03:04:14.103]  TARP did a year and a half ago.
[03:04:14.123 --> 03:04:17.484]  I mean, it's incredible.
[03:04:17.504 --> 03:04:20.546]  So the group that's engineered this, let's give them even more power.
[03:04:20.586 --> 03:04:23.207]  So it's not just, you know, we've got to beat them now.
[03:04:23.527 --> 03:04:29.350]  If we don't expose them now and give real solutions, they're going to use the crisis they created for even more power.
[03:04:30.069 --> 03:04:31.390]  Yeah, it's ruled by banks.
[03:04:31.510 --> 03:04:33.932]  I mean, this isn't going to fix the crisis.
[03:04:33.972 --> 03:04:44.580]  For example, a June 25th Newsweek article by Michael Hirsch put it this way, the bill, quote, effectively anoints the existing banking elite.
[03:04:44.620 --> 03:04:50.524]  The bill makes it likely that they will be the future giants of banking as well, for all time.
[03:04:50.544 --> 03:04:54.107]  For example, do you know who the biggest investor in BP is?
[03:04:54.928 --> 03:04:55.888]  Oh, yes, Goldman Sachs.
[03:04:56.389 --> 03:04:56.969]  Oh, J.P.
[03:04:57.029 --> 03:04:57.450]  Morgan.
[03:04:58.228 --> 03:05:02.269]  Oh, they were the biggest, but they dumped some of their stock right before, I forgot.
[03:05:02.289 --> 03:05:07.110]  Right, well, you know, and everybody's jumping on Goldman Sachs.
[03:05:07.170 --> 03:05:10.431]  I mean, they should get a lot of blame, but J.P.
[03:05:10.491 --> 03:05:15.212]  Morgan, in the derivatives mess, is like 50 times bigger than Goldman Sachs.
[03:05:15.692 --> 03:05:17.012]  Dwarfing Goldman Sachs.
[03:05:17.072 --> 03:05:17.532]  J.P.
[03:05:17.572 --> 03:05:19.873]  Morgan is the center of this whole black hole.
[03:05:20.493 --> 03:05:21.653]  And also, I want to say something else.
[03:05:21.714 --> 03:05:26.775]  I just came back from a trip to Sweden, Germany, and Iceland, and I do want to talk about Iceland.
[03:05:26.795 --> 03:05:37.699]  I know you had Berejita on a couple days ago, but you're big, and there are people in Sweden and Iceland right now listening to this program right now.
[03:05:37.759 --> 03:05:39.580]  Your name is well known over there.
[03:05:42.241 --> 03:05:44.961]  Well, worldwide, people are waking up thanks to your work.
[03:05:45.002 --> 03:05:46.362]  You certainly helped educate me.
[03:05:46.942 --> 03:05:48.963]  How many years ago did the Money Masters come out?
[03:05:51.066 --> 03:05:53.049]  Uh, it was 14 to 15 years now.
[03:06:05.964 --> 03:06:11.548]  I just happened to mention that there was some type of symbolism related to the Wizard of Oz and I'd never heard that before.
[03:06:11.568 --> 03:06:14.050]  I couldn't believe how somehow I had missed this.
[03:06:14.570 --> 03:06:23.616]  And so I jumped on the web and immediately saw that this had been the talk in economics academia for about 20 years.
[03:06:24.877 --> 03:06:36.439]  And so I said, oh yeah, this is the perfect vehicle, because to me, the Money Masters, well, I've always been looking for a way to re-film it, because we did it so long ago, it was even before digital.
[03:06:36.480 --> 03:06:42.021]  I mean, it was filmed in High Eight, for example, and it's just getting, you know, a little worn out looking, if you ask me.
[03:06:42.521 --> 03:06:48.562]  And also, it's too long, and I couldn't figure out, you know, how can we do this in a shorter format so it's a more effective political tool?
[03:06:48.662 --> 03:06:50.182]  And that's, I think, what we've done.
[03:06:50.202 --> 03:06:52.763]  Here, we filmed The Secret of Oz in HD.
[03:06:53.283 --> 03:06:59.267]  Well, I mean, the Money Masters is an authoritative classic and it's deep in history and the whole system.
[03:06:59.307 --> 03:07:02.610]  I mean, I can't believe you're kind of knocking your masterpiece there.
[03:07:03.971 --> 03:07:06.893]  Well, I just, I think this is a more effective political tool.
[03:07:06.913 --> 03:07:11.696]  I mean, it takes somebody pretty dedicated to sit down for three hours and 23 minutes, you know.
[03:07:11.716 --> 03:07:16.320]  Now, this you can sit down and spend a hundred minutes and get the same story.
[03:07:17.082 --> 03:07:17.603]  Well, it does.
[03:07:17.663 --> 03:07:22.689]  I mean, it does look crisper because it's shot in high def, but I mean, I just got to commend all of it because I know I'm instrumental.
[03:07:22.969 --> 03:07:26.934]  But I am the type of guy that will sit down and watch C-SPAN for three hours, so I guess I get your point.
[03:07:27.695 --> 03:07:29.678]  But you travel all over the world for this.
[03:07:30.959 --> 03:07:33.443]  Let's talk about some more of what the film covers.
[03:07:34.545 --> 03:07:39.427]  I want to say something first of all about, uh, I want people to be hopeful here.
[03:07:39.927 --> 03:07:48.310]  And, uh, you know, I think the good part that's going on right now is these guys always get way over arrogant with their power.
[03:07:48.330 --> 03:07:53.132]  I think Obama, the whole Obama thing, they've totally overplayed their hand.
[03:07:53.652 --> 03:07:55.813]  They're trying to bite off way too much.
[03:07:55.873 --> 03:07:58.014]  The American people is way hip.
[03:07:58.635 --> 03:08:01.040]  The baggers have wrecked the hell out of us.
[03:08:09.652 --> 03:08:12.494]  We might push a lot of them out of the next election.
[03:08:12.514 --> 03:08:20.740]  That's still not going to fix it unless we fix the monetary system, unless we fix the debt problem.
[03:08:21.020 --> 03:08:25.183]  We're never going to fix this under the current scheme of things.
[03:08:25.483 --> 03:08:32.388]  We have to go at the debt money system and the ability of the banks to create 98% of our money.
[03:08:33.789 --> 03:08:37.611]  And you went to Iceland to show how the same groups are robbing them.
[03:08:37.991 --> 03:08:38.912]  Same groups in Greece.
[03:08:38.952 --> 03:08:39.572]  Look at Greece.
[03:08:39.972 --> 03:08:42.293]  They're telling them, you've got to give up your pensions, everything.
[03:08:42.353 --> 03:08:44.294]  Germany, Spain, Portugal.
[03:08:44.694 --> 03:08:46.315]  And the people don't owe this money.
[03:08:46.755 --> 03:08:56.320]  And then on top of it, if you look at the case of Greece, 600 plus islands, their roads, their infrastructure, having to give it to the very private banks that set them up.
[03:08:56.620 --> 03:08:58.261]  They should be arresting.
[03:08:58.721 --> 03:09:00.422]  We'll never beat them in those two countries.
[03:09:00.442 --> 03:09:04.884]  There's only two countries where we have a shot, and that's the United States and Iceland.
[03:09:05.304 --> 03:09:06.344]  I've been in Iceland.
[03:09:06.585 --> 03:09:10.086]  The reason we have a shot there is because the people are mad.
[03:09:10.566 --> 03:09:12.347]  Iceland is the home of the Vikings.
[03:09:12.687 --> 03:09:15.588]  They're very proud of their country, and they are mad right now.
[03:09:15.849 --> 03:09:18.230]  You know what I found out once I got in country?
[03:09:18.590 --> 03:09:23.052]  That not only were their interest rates indexed to inflation,
[03:09:23.652 --> 03:09:26.413]  Yeah, the bankers wrote it just to rob everybody.
[03:09:26.453 --> 03:09:29.334]  Describe what you saw on the ground in Iceland.
[03:09:43.072 --> 03:09:44.793]  Well, that's what I'm saying.
[03:09:44.853 --> 03:09:54.177]  So there's now a movement that has sprung up, which goes out and surrounds a person's house that's about to be foreclosed on, and they've been very successful.
[03:09:56.098 --> 03:10:10.184]  An absurdist party just took control of the capital city of Reykjavik, called the Best Party, and we formed a monetary reform working group when we were over in Iceland, or helped to form it,
[03:10:10.664 --> 03:10:17.127]  And we're presenting an idea called the Best Bank, based on the Bank of North Dakota, to them next week.
[03:10:17.388 --> 03:10:18.728]  We have an excellent chance.
[03:10:18.808 --> 03:10:21.990]  I spoke to three members of Parliament when I was there.
[03:10:22.270 --> 03:10:29.754]  We have an excellent chance of bringing about a right money system in Iceland, because these people are so mad and so fiercely independent.
[03:10:30.194 --> 03:10:42.201]  And I urge you, Alex, and everybody in the sound of my voice, to support Icelandic products at this point, just to help them, to be sure that Americans are going to support them in this effort.
[03:10:42.501 --> 03:10:47.124]  And the way you can do that is you can go to the Nordic Store, nordicstore.com.
[03:10:48.004 --> 03:10:52.507]  Whole Foods also carries a lot of Icelandic products.
[03:10:54.769 --> 03:10:59.492]  Yeah, because they are literally the Alamo in the fight against the bankers.
[03:10:59.533 --> 03:11:04.917]  They are the front line, and they are standing up against this evil when every other country is falling.
[03:11:05.417 --> 03:11:16.947]  Yeah, that's right, and they're one of the smallest economies, and so it's going to be a battle royal, but they're willing to fight it, and America has to support them, and the way we can really support them is to buy their products.
[03:11:18.083 --> 03:11:22.113]  Well, as you said, time is running out for the bankers, but...
[03:11:23.499 --> 03:11:25.841]  They have already ruined our economy so badly.
[03:11:25.961 --> 03:11:41.371]  Briefly describe, because I know you have this at the end of the Money Masters and a similar plan in this one, a very well-researched program to extricate ourselves from this fraudulent money system and get back on a constitutional system that built this nation.
[03:11:41.411 --> 03:11:53.279]  Until the bankers took over in 1913, we had almost zero inflation, sometimes deflation, with our currencies, our savings were strong, and on average a 10.1% yearly growth rate in the economy.
[03:11:54.340 --> 03:11:55.380]  We don't have that anymore.
[03:11:55.761 --> 03:12:00.104]  So, we built our nation without the income tax that came the same year as the Federal Reserve.
[03:12:00.124 --> 03:12:03.307]  You know, that's part of the Communist Manifesto these bankers created.
[03:12:03.347 --> 03:12:07.590]  That's right, the bankers created communism to sucker everybody back into slavery.
[03:12:08.050 --> 03:12:09.151]  Communism is serfdom.
[03:12:09.932 --> 03:12:11.113]  Globalism is treason.
[03:12:11.513 --> 03:12:16.497]  I mean, let's go over your plan, the plan to rectify things.
[03:12:18.411 --> 03:12:27.353]  Well, basically you have to eliminate the ability, number one, job one, is to eliminate the ability of governments to borrow.
[03:12:28.893 --> 03:12:31.674]  National debt should be absolutely illegal.
[03:12:32.094 --> 03:12:35.875]  And there's a couple of approaches that we can use to do that.
[03:12:37.115 --> 03:12:41.256]  You can create debt-free money, issue it from Congress.
[03:12:42.076 --> 03:12:52.659]  Uh, issued into the economy as the new money comes in and we pay off the national debt with the new money, we gradually raise bank reserve requirements.
[03:12:53.039 --> 03:13:00.120]  So at the end we have no national debt and we have banks only able to loan out money they actually have.
[03:13:00.200 --> 03:13:02.521]  That way banks no longer can create money
[03:13:03.241 --> 03:13:06.003]  And only the government creates money.
[03:13:06.263 --> 03:13:11.547]  We don't want to eliminate commercial banks, just as they've done with the Bank of North Dakota.
[03:13:11.587 --> 03:13:15.989]  The State Bank of North Dakota works in cooperation with the local banking community.
[03:13:16.029 --> 03:13:17.891]  The local banking community loves them.
[03:13:18.511 --> 03:13:24.515]  The State Bank of North Dakota kind of serves as a mini Federal Reserve, completely outside of the federal system.
[03:13:25.295 --> 03:13:33.922]  This model can be used in every state in the union, and can go a long way towards eliminating every state deficit in this country.
[03:13:33.942 --> 03:13:49.154]  I urge everybody to go on the State Bank of North Dakota website, and probably in every state in this nation right now, there are people in your state attempting to bring about, in the state legislature, the State Bank of North Dakota concept.
[03:13:49.814 --> 03:13:50.294]  Find them.
[03:13:50.334 --> 03:13:52.195]  If you can't find them, start your own group.
[03:13:52.555 --> 03:13:55.595]  That's the thing that... But let's look at the other side of this.
[03:13:56.856 --> 03:14:02.217]  Because of industrialization, because of technology, we could all be living like literal kings.
[03:14:02.677 --> 03:14:07.138]  And when you read what Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, the UN, Club of Rome, they all finance it.
[03:14:07.178 --> 03:14:11.619]  They say, we want carbon tax to shut down the industrialized society.
[03:14:12.139 --> 03:14:12.759]  They know
[03:14:13.439 --> 03:14:35.988]  That humanity tends to be wealthy now, and then that makes us not dependent on them, and the government, the banks control, and so they actively admit they've created a black hole monetary system that makes us poor, and they've made this type of austerity a beautiful thing, but not for them, for us, so they've dolled up
[03:14:36.348 --> 03:14:39.330]  They're neo-serfdom and feudalism is something beautiful and good.
[03:14:39.790 --> 03:14:44.273]  So if we don't stop them, their goal is to make us debt slaves.
[03:14:44.333 --> 03:14:47.374]  I mean, these are premeditated, wicked people.
[03:14:47.414 --> 03:14:49.796]  Can you speak to your research along that line?
[03:14:50.236 --> 03:14:53.138]  Their goal is to return us to a state of serfdom.
[03:14:53.218 --> 03:14:55.099]  And that is the key.
[03:14:55.699 --> 03:15:02.862]  Uh, fight through all the history of humanity is whether or not humanity will be able to escape serfdom.
[03:15:03.222 --> 03:15:10.145]  And that's why government is such a precious gift, because it is the only thing that stands between us and serfdom.
[03:15:10.405 --> 03:15:12.226]  They want to eliminate that.
[03:15:12.806 --> 03:15:16.967]  That's why they love to corrupt government and make government look bad.
[03:15:17.007 --> 03:15:19.128]  And that's why Congress has such low ratings.
[03:15:21.970 --> 03:15:25.473]  And they say privatize it, but that's another form of corporate governance.
[03:15:25.493 --> 03:15:32.458]  See, we only see enemies as nations, like Russia or China, but really it's a corporate takeover.
[03:15:32.518 --> 03:15:33.479]  That's the treason.
[03:15:33.800 --> 03:15:42.447]  I am for small government, but I'm for a republic that then guards us, because we are the government, and guards our freedom.
[03:15:43.413 --> 03:15:47.077]  Centralization of power at every level is a bad thing.
[03:15:47.197 --> 03:15:53.264]  Decentralization of power at every level is almost always a great thing.
[03:15:53.625 --> 03:15:57.048]  And that's what the whole concept of state government in the U.S.
[03:15:57.108 --> 03:15:57.829]  federal system.
[03:15:59.631 --> 03:16:02.393]  Remain sovereign that the states have plenty of power.
[03:16:02.713 --> 03:16:05.255]  And of course, that's what Obama is directly attacking.
[03:16:05.575 --> 03:16:07.556]  We have to decentralize power.
[03:16:07.576 --> 03:16:08.597]  We have to get the U.S.
[03:16:08.697 --> 03:16:09.438]  out of the U.N.
[03:16:09.458 --> 03:16:13.741]  for the most part, get it out of all these international banking agreements, etc., etc.
[03:16:14.041 --> 03:16:15.702]  Decentralization is a good thing.
[03:16:19.755 --> 03:16:29.487]  Well, you're absolutely right, and I think people are beginning to discover that because I've seen the banks push a kind of fake libertarianism of, oh, see, government's bad, let us privatize it.
[03:16:29.667 --> 03:16:35.274]  But that's not privatization to take roads we built with our money and then give it to bankers to put toll roads on it.
[03:16:35.514 --> 03:16:36.635]  That's not free market.
[03:16:37.543 --> 03:16:43.125]  Well, you know, another thing we could do in the interim period, this Tobin tax is really a great thing.
[03:16:43.725 --> 03:16:46.466]  That hits at the heart of the high-frequency trading.
[03:16:46.506 --> 03:16:58.770]  If you just put a 1% tax on all of these high-frequency trades, you know, it could raise approximately between $5 and $7 trillion for the U.S.
[03:16:58.810 --> 03:16:59.370]  economy.
[03:16:59.630 --> 03:17:03.011]  We only collect a little over a trillion in income tax.
[03:17:03.051 --> 03:17:06.032]  We could wipe out all of our taxation if we could.
[03:17:06.052 --> 03:17:08.594]  Again, the income tax goes to interest of the bankers.
[03:17:09.094 --> 03:17:13.316]  This is the tax rates just on the income tax in six months that go up.
[03:17:13.556 --> 03:17:14.337]  10% bracket goes up to 15.
[03:17:14.617 --> 03:17:16.758]  That's poor people, folks.
[03:17:17.018 --> 03:17:17.939]  25% bracket goes to 28.
[03:17:19.160 --> 03:17:19.380]  28 goes to 31.
[03:17:19.420 --> 03:17:19.880]  33 to 36.
[03:17:19.920 --> 03:17:20.440]  35 to 39.6.
[03:17:20.521 --> 03:17:23.762]  Basically 40.
[03:17:24.123 --> 03:17:28.145]  And they've gotten rid of most of the exemptions, and they're raising all these other taxes.
[03:17:28.685 --> 03:17:31.187]  I mean, and almost all of this is going to the bankers.
[03:17:31.690 --> 03:17:36.793]  Well, you know, you're absolutely right in that we stand at such a critical juncture right now.
[03:17:36.854 --> 03:17:43.238]  They're trying to seal their deal to make it impossible for us to escape, but they've way overplayed their hand.
[03:17:43.618 --> 03:17:51.263]  And now we've learned the secret of prosperity, and that is just eliminate their ability to collect interest from us on our very money.
[03:17:51.303 --> 03:17:53.865]  We don't have to rent our money into existence.
[03:17:54.145 --> 03:17:55.046]  Stay there, stay there.
[03:17:55.106 --> 03:17:56.067]  Final segment straight ahead.
[03:17:56.087 --> 03:17:57.368]  The film is Secret of Oz.
[03:17:57.869 --> 03:18:01.192]  It's the number one reason for slow and clogged bath drains.
[03:18:01.472 --> 03:18:02.773]  That's right, hair.
[03:18:03.133 --> 03:18:06.076]  And the number one way to open drains plugged with hair?
[03:18:06.336 --> 03:18:07.377]  The drain claw.
[03:18:08.238 --> 03:18:10.200]  Stop standing in dirty bath water.
[03:18:10.440 --> 03:18:12.101]  Stop using dangerous chemicals.
[03:18:12.322 --> 03:18:16.726]  Just push the drain claw past the pop-up in your sink or tub, twist, and pull.
[03:18:16.746 --> 03:18:20.429]  You'll be shocked at what this little tool can pull out of your drain.
[03:18:20.689 --> 03:18:27.693]  The Drain Claw has over 100 tiny hooks that claw through hair, toothpaste and shampoo that slows and clogs your drains.
[03:18:27.973 --> 03:18:31.055]  See how it works right now at TheDrainClaw.com.
[03:18:31.815 --> 03:18:39.119]  The Drain Claw is made in the USA and is the safest, easiest, most environmentally friendly solution to unclog bath drains.
[03:18:39.379 --> 03:18:42.641]  Get one for $6.99 or three for $15.
[03:18:42.801 --> 03:18:45.102]  The Drain Claw can be used over and over.
[03:18:45.402 --> 03:18:46.943]  Don't be fooled by substitutes.
[03:18:47.203 --> 03:18:48.184]  Buy the original.
[03:18:48.384 --> 03:18:49.665]  Buy the Drain Claw.

[03:18:52.387 --> 03:18:55.350]  That's The Drain Claw at TheDrainClaw.com.
[03:18:57.451 --> 03:18:59.713]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:18:59.733 --> 03:19:02.014]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:19:02.034 --> 03:19:04.917]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:19:05.357 --> 03:19:10.100]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:19:10.481 --> 03:19:14.664]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:19:14.964 --> 03:19:17.287]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:19:17.307 --> 03:19:19.851]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:19:20.191 --> 03:19:22.774]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:19:23.115 --> 03:19:30.725]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:19:31.045 --> 03:19:36.306]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:19:36.326 --> 03:19:39.187]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:19:39.287 --> 03:19:42.708]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:19:42.968 --> 03:19:43.868]  And I got news for you.
[03:19:44.048 --> 03:19:45.348]  You're everyone else.
[03:19:45.388 --> 03:19:46.489]  Invisible Empire.

[03:20:51.855 --> 03:21:00.578]  Scientists emit chemtrails are creating artificial clouds.
[03:21:00.598 --> 03:21:01.198]  Mainstream news.
[03:21:09.181 --> 03:21:11.822]  Dollar plunges after UN call to ditch Greenback.
[03:21:11.862 --> 03:21:13.802]  That's up at GCNLive.com.
[03:21:16.663 --> 03:21:20.484]  We've got our Ron Paul interview from yesterday posted up at GCNLive.com.
[03:21:20.524 --> 03:21:31.908]  And an amazing article, Popular Music is the Babylon System, another mainstream London Guardian article that Watson wrote about it, where they admit that world government and Illuminati is being promoted all over
[03:21:32.668 --> 03:21:34.869]  The media, by Lady Gaga, everything.
[03:21:35.270 --> 03:21:40.293]  That's all at GCNLive.com and of course backed up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:21:41.214 --> 03:21:42.754]  I'll be back Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:21:42.775 --> 03:21:52.541]  and of course on Monday, but this Fourth of July, you know, I meant to get into the Declaration of Independence and I'll probably get into it Sunday, but everybody should read this because this is what the Fourth of July is all about.
[03:21:53.405 --> 03:21:55.806]  And they understood the type of tyranny they were facing.
[03:21:55.846 --> 03:21:57.946]  And quite frankly, it's nothing compared to what we're facing.
[03:21:58.226 --> 03:22:00.827]  This is more scientific, dehumanizing.
[03:22:01.247 --> 03:22:05.048]  The globalists admit they're transhumanists who want us to be feudal slaves.
[03:22:06.429 --> 03:22:08.389]  They admit they're not going to give us any quarter.
[03:22:08.850 --> 03:22:10.750]  They admit they want to bankrupt us.
[03:22:10.830 --> 03:22:13.211]  I mean, they constantly brag about it.
[03:22:13.731 --> 03:22:16.932]  But if we just put out the alternative to their tyranny,
[03:22:18.086 --> 03:22:22.928]  They will fall, and that's why Bill Still's new film, The Secret of Oz, is so important.
[03:22:22.968 --> 03:22:24.889]  Again, it's available at Infowars.com.
[03:22:24.909 --> 03:22:26.370]  We've got four minutes left, sir.
[03:22:26.410 --> 03:22:27.650]  Going out, you've got the floor.
[03:22:27.790 --> 03:22:29.991]  Closing comments about your new amazing film.
[03:22:30.011 --> 03:22:36.934]  Alright, well I would just boil this down to three quick sound bites as far as what to do, what to take it from here.
[03:22:37.335 --> 03:22:40.096]  On the international level, support Iceland.
[03:22:40.256 --> 03:22:45.758]  Iceland is our best shot to get a toehold for a correct money system in the world system.
[03:22:45.858 --> 03:22:46.979]  Once we get it in Iceland,
[03:22:47.319 --> 03:22:48.421]  Then I was in Sweden.
[03:22:48.521 --> 03:22:52.346]  I could have pointed to Iceland from Sweden and Sweden would have paid more attention.
[03:22:52.827 --> 03:23:02.962]  The way you do that is you go to Icelandnaturally.com, NordicStore.com, or Whole Foods sells a lot of Icelandic stuff.
[03:23:03.602 --> 03:23:03.822]  Okay.
[03:23:19.030 --> 03:23:21.152]  Uh, the, the state bank issue will come up.
[03:23:21.632 --> 03:23:24.915]  Uh, what, what that means is that states no longer have to borrow.
[03:23:24.955 --> 03:23:27.036]  They no longer have to float bond issues.
[03:23:27.076 --> 03:23:33.201]  They're totally saved all the interest payments and put it, uh, their, their money is put more in their control.
[03:23:33.841 --> 03:23:37.622]  On the national level, it all boils down to just one phrase.
[03:23:38.242 --> 03:23:44.184]  One phrase fixes everything on the national level, and that's no more national debt.
[03:23:44.704 --> 03:23:53.667]  If you eliminated the ability of the government to borrow, they would have to face the political consequences of spending immediately because they'd have to raise taxes.
[03:23:54.087 --> 03:23:56.268]  So that would solve everything else.
[03:23:57.688 --> 03:24:03.010]  We'd have to eliminate the entire national debt, and that's my solution in three quick steps.
[03:24:03.905 --> 03:24:04.906]  Well, I'll say it again.
[03:24:04.966 --> 03:24:05.806]  It's us or them.
[03:24:05.866 --> 03:24:07.307]  There's no more time to screw around.
[03:24:07.347 --> 03:24:08.767]  The world government's out in the open.
[03:24:08.787 --> 03:24:13.450]  They're telling you the solution is the same banks that ripped you off will now have a world government.
[03:24:13.490 --> 03:24:17.191]  You'll pay carbon taxes to them and the dollar will be under its control.
[03:24:17.332 --> 03:24:18.292]  Unelected bankers.
[03:24:18.712 --> 03:24:20.573]  They've already got our banking system here.
[03:24:21.033 --> 03:24:24.435]  Now they want to bring it openly to the offshore corporations.
[03:24:26.636 --> 03:24:27.997]  It's the magnitude of this.
[03:24:28.078 --> 03:24:29.879]  I know a lot of people didn't want to believe it.
[03:24:29.899 --> 03:24:34.163]  The media would demonize you a decade ago if you talked about the Federal Reserve being private.
[03:24:34.504 --> 03:24:41.270]  And as Ron Paul and others have said, the globalists are now very upset because even though they were able to kill his audit, the Fed bill,
[03:24:42.171 --> 03:24:55.754]  It got massive co-sponsorship, and people are now at universities and everywhere talking about the corporate illegitimate takeover of America, and now the elite is being recognized as the enemy.
[03:24:56.495 --> 03:25:00.176]  The puppet presidents, people are realizing, are just that, puppets.
[03:25:00.536 --> 03:25:00.836]  Go ahead.
[03:25:01.396 --> 03:25:01.736]  Go ahead.
[03:25:02.256 --> 03:25:06.897]  If I could say one more thing, and that's eliminating the Fed will not fix the problem.
[03:25:07.017 --> 03:25:09.438]  National debt is the solution.
[03:25:09.963 --> 03:25:10.944]  No, no, I agree with you.
[03:25:11.024 --> 03:25:16.707]  But, I mean, we've got to certainly get rid of the Feds so we can turn the monetary control back over to Congress.
[03:25:17.308 --> 03:25:21.170]  We'll have you back on, Bill, still soon to talk more about the film and play some clips of it.
[03:25:21.471 --> 03:25:23.612]  Secret of Oz, available on InfoWars.com.
[03:25:24.052 --> 03:25:25.093]  Great talking to you.
[03:25:25.113 --> 03:25:26.194]  Have a great Fourth of July, Bill.
[03:25:28.015 --> 03:25:32.058]  Great job to the crew, great job to the listeners, the affiliates, the sponsors, all of you.
[03:25:32.358 --> 03:25:36.761]  Retransmission starts now on the audio streams, InfoWars.com, back Sunday, 4 p.m.
[03:25:36.801 --> 03:25:37.061]  Central.
[03:25:39.517 --> 03:25:41.581]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:25:42.142 --> 03:25:45.288]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today!
[03:25:48.390 --> 03:25:54.134]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[03:25:54.854 --> 03:25:59.297]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.
[03:26:00.097 --> 03:26:13.666]  Featuring Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Joseph Farah, David Icke, Naomi Wolf, G. Edward Griffin, Doug McIntyre, Mark Crispin Miller, Mickey Z, Doug Casey, David McIlvaney, and myself, Alex Jones.
[03:26:14.246 --> 03:26:14.767]  We're good.
