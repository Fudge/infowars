[00:00:04.872 --> 00:00:06.193]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.193 --> 00:00:07.954]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.954 --> 00:00:09.715]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.715 --> 00:00:11.316]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.316 --> 00:00:12.856]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.856 --> 00:00:17.039]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.181]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.738 --> 00:00:34.759]  Big transmission lined up for you today.
[00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:41.320]  It is amazing the level of tyranny I've got here in my stack we're going to be covering.
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.161]  We got Brian Kraft and Jimmy Tula joining us.
[00:00:45.161 --> 00:00:51.202]  They made the 10-hour documentary film, Fall of America and Western World.
[00:00:51.202 --> 00:00:56.743]  They'll be joining us coming up in the second hour in studio today, coming to visit us in Austin.
[00:00:56.743 --> 00:00:58.404]  Look forward to that in T-minus 60 minutes.
[00:00:59.324 --> 00:01:17.412]  And then Gerald Solente, the Trends Forecaster, joining us for a full hour and a half to cover everything going on in the world, all the big issues, the banking collapse accelerating, the Iran situation, the flotilla, the North Korean situation with the standoff there.
[00:01:17.412 --> 00:01:26.836]  Just so much to talk about with Gerald Solente joining us coming up for the full third hour and part of the fourth hour today.
[00:01:29.693 --> 00:01:33.964]  Other than that, I've got a lot of news here.
[00:01:33.964 --> 00:01:38.033]  I mean, it's coming out every day, just how criminal and mafia the Obama...
[00:01:39.171 --> 00:01:40.052]  administration is.
[00:01:40.052 --> 00:01:46.535]  I almost just called it the Obama deception, instead of the Obama administration, because that's what it is.
[00:01:46.535 --> 00:01:49.336]  A complete fraud, a complete joke.
[00:01:49.336 --> 00:02:02.642]  The system, Goldman Sachs namely, running a private central bank, Federal Reserve, wanted a group of absolute mobster criminals who aren't just high-level corporate crooks, but that are actual street thugs.
[00:02:02.642 --> 00:02:07.885]  Rahm Emanuel, Blagojevich, Bam Bam Obama, all of them.
[00:02:08.851 --> 00:02:09.551]  Barry Sitaro
[00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.003]  Rami can do no wrong.
[00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:32.327]  After all, he's not even really an American citizen.
[00:02:32.327 --> 00:02:41.799]  Nothing wrong with being Israeli, it's just I have a problem with having a dual citizen who chose to serve in the Israeli military, not our own military, as the White House Chief of Staff.
[00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:42.900]  And you better believe
[00:02:43.801 --> 00:02:49.524]  He's in there blackmailing Mr. Barack Hussein, Barry Sotero, Obama.
[00:02:49.524 --> 00:02:52.606]  So that's another big issue I have with all of this.
[00:02:52.606 --> 00:02:53.806]  So that's coming out.
[00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:57.869]  Prosecutor says Blagojevich part of an illegal shakedown operation.
[00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:58.349]  Well, of course!
[00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:05.572]  How do you think Chicago runs their operation?
[00:03:05.572 --> 00:03:09.815]  I mean, what, is it a conspiracy theory that Chicago's been mob-run for a hundred years?
[00:03:09.815 --> 00:03:13.437]  I guess it's a conspiracy that Al Capone was a gangster, or that it was the St.
[00:03:13.437 --> 00:03:18.360]  Valentine's Day massacre, or that the Dailies are some of the biggest mobsters in the world.
[00:03:19.858 --> 00:03:23.460]  Yes, they're mobsters, and of course they want your guns.
[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.603]  They want your guns because they want to own you.
[00:03:26.603 --> 00:03:32.627]  When mobsters come in and rob a bank or shake down a grocery store, they say, stick em up, stick em up, hands in the air.
[00:03:32.627 --> 00:03:36.329]  And they go behind the register and go, oh, you gonna use a .45 on me?
[00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.411]  And they pistol whip the old man, you know, behind the liquor store counter.
[00:03:39.411 --> 00:03:42.893]  Hey, I'll take a little cash for me right out of here.
[00:03:42.893 --> 00:03:49.138]  Well, now we moved on to running your cities and running your presidency, and we runs it all now.
[00:03:50.578 --> 00:03:57.403]  By the way, all over the country they're harassing Amish now, saying the way they farm is not environmentally sensitive.
[00:03:57.403 --> 00:03:59.304]  I'm afraid they're going to have to be shut down.
[00:03:59.304 --> 00:04:02.086]  That's in the New York Times.
[00:04:02.086 --> 00:04:11.553]  Everything must be shut down but big, giant, genetic-engineered, huge pig farms dumping thousands of tons of manure into rivers.
[00:04:11.553 --> 00:04:12.373]  That's good.
[00:04:13.294 --> 00:04:19.779]  But you've got a truly sustainable, thousand-year-old type, uh, base agriculture.
[00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:23.422]  No, you're not.
[00:04:23.422 --> 00:04:25.784]  No, you're not.
[00:04:25.784 --> 00:04:27.846]  The Amish are Al-Qaeda.
[00:04:27.846 --> 00:04:29.367]  Look at their beards.
[00:04:29.367 --> 00:04:31.189]  They're probably working.
[00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:33.390]  In fact, have you heard the latest?
[00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.491]  Have you heard the latest?
[00:04:34.491 --> 00:04:36.733]  Bin Laden isn't hiding in Iran.
[00:04:36.733 --> 00:04:40.676]  No, he's hiding in rural Pennsylvania with the Amish.
[00:04:41.457 --> 00:04:46.161]  That's why we've got to call in strategic nuclear strikes from submarines.
[00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:49.224]  Because Bin Laden is there.
[00:04:49.224 --> 00:04:51.025]  And Bin Laden's in your gun cabinet.
[00:04:51.025 --> 00:04:53.067]  Bin Laden's at checkpoints.
[00:04:53.067 --> 00:04:59.213]  Anytime government wants to stomp your guts out and suck you dry, it's because they're fighting Al Qaeda!

[00:05:48.187 --> 00:06:03.051]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:06:03.051 --> 00:06:08.372]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:06:08.372 --> 00:06:10.412]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:06:10.412 --> 00:06:15.413]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:06:15.413 --> 00:06:16.594]  How much do you want?
[00:06:16.594 --> 00:06:17.334]  When do you want it?
[00:06:17.714 --> 00:06:19.594]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:06:19.594 --> 00:06:20.675]  When will you need it?
[00:06:20.675 --> 00:06:22.875]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:06:22.875 --> 00:06:24.216]  Will there be any food?
[00:06:24.216 --> 00:06:25.736]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:06:25.736 --> 00:06:31.017]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:06:31.017 --> 00:06:34.598]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:06:34.598 --> 00:06:38.059]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:39.640]  How much will you need?
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.540]  We don't know.
[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:41.641]  How much do you want?
[00:06:41.641 --> 00:06:42.581]  All you can get.
[00:06:42.581 --> 00:06:43.682]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:06:43.682 --> 00:06:46.724]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:06:46.724 --> 00:06:54.248]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:06:54.248 --> 00:06:55.408]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:55.408 --> 00:07:01.912]  This is customer service.
[00:07:01.912 --> 00:07:02.912]  How may I help you?
[00:07:02.912 --> 00:07:05.974]  I'd like to cancel my order for your super skincare formula.
[00:07:05.974 --> 00:07:07.335]  And why are you canceling?
[00:07:07.335 --> 00:07:07.815]  Honestly?
[00:07:08.652 --> 00:07:10.393]  I found a product that really works.
[00:07:10.393 --> 00:07:11.933]  Can I ask what it's called?
[00:07:11.933 --> 00:07:13.194]  It's called Night Skin.
[00:07:13.194 --> 00:07:16.715]  It's the only cream I found that helps fade age spots on my skin.
[00:07:16.715 --> 00:07:17.395]  Really?
[00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:20.336]  And Night Skin supports the production of natural collagen.
[00:07:20.336 --> 00:07:22.017]  My face looks amazing!
[00:07:22.017 --> 00:07:24.138]  Maybe you can tell me how to get Night Skin.
[00:07:24.468 --> 00:07:29.052]  Before you spend tons of money on so-called quick fix skin creams, try Nightskin.
[00:07:29.052 --> 00:07:36.278]  Nightskin is a scientifically formulated anti-aging cream made by Dr. Arthur Perry, an award-winning Harvard-trained plastic surgeon.

[00:07:51.251 --> 00:07:51.372]  1-800-360-8306.
[00:07:51.372 --> 00:07:51.452]  1-800-360-8306.
[00:07:51.452 --> 00:07:52.172]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:52.172 --> 00:07:53.294]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:07.671 --> 00:08:09.332]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[00:08:09.332 --> 00:08:13.655]  It's all posted up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:08:13.655 --> 00:08:17.318]  But more and more, I don't even cover one-tenth of the news.
[00:08:17.318 --> 00:08:25.244]  I probably got 130, 140, I was trying to count them earlier, news articles here, each one more insane than the next.
[00:08:25.244 --> 00:08:27.526]  Mainstream media is creating another hoax.
[00:08:29.292 --> 00:08:31.293]  And they can get away with hoaxes.
[00:08:31.293 --> 00:08:31.953]  They do it all the time.
[00:08:31.953 --> 00:08:57.006]  They're saying it's illegal to film police, and the media for the last few years has been saying this, and so cops now all over the country, they'll come up to somebody filming riot police at a public demonstration and arrest you, saying it's wiretapping, and they will bring it to a grand jury, they will indict you, they will tell the fluoride head, thumb-sucking slave jury this, and you will go to prison!
[00:08:58.123 --> 00:08:59.585]  Land of the free, home of the brave.
[00:08:59.585 --> 00:09:13.239]  You can't film God government, but God government can license plate scan you, face scan you, thousands of cameras up in every city tracking everywhere you go, government listening to you without warrants, arresting citizens secretly, torturing them.
[00:09:13.239 --> 00:09:18.043]  The president can go on TV, the former president, and say, yes, I still support torture.
[00:09:18.043 --> 00:09:19.645]  I would do it all over again.
[00:09:19.645 --> 00:09:20.866]  On television last week,
[00:09:21.707 --> 00:09:41.371]  And then, remember, scores of people, what, more than 30 people, went to prison for torturing in Afghanistan and Iraq for following the orders, and one of them tried to use that in court from Afghanistan, and they were charged with the Patriot Act to gag them from using the memos from the White House ordering them to torture.
[00:09:41.371 --> 00:09:43.192]  So, that's freedom.
[00:09:43.192 --> 00:09:49.813]  You're ordered to torture, you torture, and then you go to prison, and the president comes out and says, I like ordering torture.
[00:09:51.164 --> 00:09:53.986]  And he doesn't get in trouble.
[00:09:53.986 --> 00:09:56.327]  See how that's upside down?
[00:09:56.327 --> 00:10:01.851]  That's like saying we arrested this mafia hitman for murdering someone.
[00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:09.155]  He shot him four times when this local other mob boss walked out of his coffee shop and was getting in his Mercedes.
[00:10:09.155 --> 00:10:16.020]  And Don Julio, or whatever his name, gave the order, but he's not in trouble.
[00:10:16.963 --> 00:10:24.569]  And Don Julio admits that he gave the order for his hitman, his mechanic, to go kill this other guy.
[00:10:24.569 --> 00:10:27.872]  But we're going to throw the mechanic, the hitman, in prison.
[00:10:27.872 --> 00:10:32.295]  But even though Don Julio admits he gave the order and paid for it, he's not going to get in trouble.
[00:10:32.295 --> 00:10:34.457]  And Don Julio is going to go on television.
[00:10:34.457 --> 00:10:41.843]  Don Bush, Don Shrub, Don W, is going to go on television and brag about it.
[00:10:41.843 --> 00:10:42.504]  Nothing's going to happen.
[00:10:44.346 --> 00:10:46.667]  By the way, I happen to know the Supreme Court rulings.
[00:10:46.667 --> 00:10:48.088]  I happen to know the state rulings.
[00:10:48.088 --> 00:10:52.691]  That's how the government can film you without a warrant in a public place because there's no perception of privacy.
[00:10:53.604 --> 00:10:54.444]  Okay?
[00:10:54.444 --> 00:10:57.465]  But these idiots that get charged end up plea bargaining.
[00:10:57.465 --> 00:11:03.168]  The cops know full well, and I've got the three states, and I have the article here that's deceptive.
[00:11:03.168 --> 00:11:06.429]  It says in three states it's illegal to film cops, even in public.
[00:11:06.429 --> 00:11:14.012]  And it talks about a guy on a motorcycle who was, it's very popular with motorcyclists to put a little mounted camera, a big mounted camera on his helmet.
[00:11:14.012 --> 00:11:16.893]  He was filming himself driving recklessly.
[00:11:16.893 --> 00:11:19.474]  I wouldn't bet against the cops arresting the guy.
[00:11:20.934 --> 00:11:23.256]  You know, if they think it was reckless.
[00:11:23.256 --> 00:11:43.331]  But no, they don't arrest him, they give him a ticket, and then they see it on YouTube later, and now they've indicted him with a felony, when the guy's already filming himself, before the cop pulls him over, the plainclothes cop jumps out, has a gun, makes himself look like a scared buffoon, then the guy puts it on YouTube, and they arrest him for it.
[00:11:43.331 --> 00:11:47.735]  With a big camera mounted on his head, that a two-year-old would know was a camera.
[00:11:49.448 --> 00:11:51.388]  And they say it's wiretapping.
[00:11:51.388 --> 00:12:04.411]  Wiretapping laws are for someone coming up to, say, their ex-wife's house and going to the phone box and putting alligator clips on a tape recorder, that's when they pass these laws, and listening to what goes on in your house.
[00:12:04.411 --> 00:12:12.393]  It's illegal to go up to somebody's window on their property and stick a camera up to it and take photos of, say, a woman in her own bathtub.
[00:12:12.393 --> 00:12:13.713]  That is a serious crime.
[00:12:14.938 --> 00:12:18.186]  Eavesdropping, wiretapping, whatever you want to call it, okay?
[00:12:18.186 --> 00:12:21.114]  Some states it's a felony and it should be, okay?
[00:12:21.114 --> 00:12:22.537]  Who wants perverts looking through your window?
[00:12:23.632 --> 00:12:27.754]  But it is not against the law to videotape police.
[00:12:27.754 --> 00:12:38.358]  Now, it is against the law if police are, say, got somebody spread eagle, and they may have a weapon or drugs or something, and you come over and get in their space and distract them.
[00:12:38.358 --> 00:12:43.600]  You get up, say, within 20 feet, and they say, you're disrupting our operation, get back.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.981]  Then you could be arrested if you don't get back.
[00:12:45.981 --> 00:12:50.443]  But to say, I mean, they've arrested the guy in Maryland who filmed cops
[00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:58.361]  Gotta be 300 yards away beating an innocent person up for fun.
[00:12:58.361 --> 00:12:59.402]  They're arresting people
[00:13:00.512 --> 00:13:13.018]  I've seen cases where the police come to somebody's door, beat them up, and the business owner has a surveillance system on their gas station, and the people put it on YouTube, and the cops arrest them!
[00:13:13.018 --> 00:13:22.303]  I've seen cases where cops are caught stealing, or beating somebody up, or cheating on their wife, and it ends up on YouTube, and they arrest the people.
[00:13:22.663 --> 00:13:31.149]  This is thuggish, this is criminal, and I'm calling the police agencies out to do this as filthy, degenerate criminals.
[00:13:31.149 --> 00:13:34.932]  You are tyrants, and you disgrace your uniform and America.
[00:13:34.932 --> 00:13:37.934]  It is disgusting.
[00:13:37.934 --> 00:13:43.098]  Okay, that just happens to be one of the articles in my stack that when I read it, they're just everywhere.
[00:13:43.098 --> 00:13:50.023]  And the headline is, let me get it here, Are Cameras the New Guns?
[00:13:51.752 --> 00:13:53.838]  Well, yeah, I have footage from three years ago.
[00:13:53.838 --> 00:13:57.629]  It's in the film, uh, Truth Rising.
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.321]  That I made, totally action-packed.
[00:14:01.321 --> 00:14:03.443]  It's about activists on the streets.
[00:14:03.443 --> 00:14:08.967]  And they've got a permit, even when you go and lick the boots and get the permit in New York, and got the little piece of paper.
[00:14:08.967 --> 00:14:11.689]  I've been there when the cops try to deny our little permit.
[00:14:11.689 --> 00:14:15.851]  They turn our right into a privilege, and they're like, I don't think I'm gonna let you today.
[00:14:15.851 --> 00:14:17.012]  Are you talking back?
[00:14:17.012 --> 00:14:22.556]  I'll take you to jail right now, punk.
[00:14:22.556 --> 00:14:26.899]  You are here on this earth for one reason, and that is to pay my paycheck, slave.
[00:14:26.899 --> 00:14:27.460]  You understand?
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.406]  It's even worse than that, the video we've got.
[00:14:32.406 --> 00:14:37.193]  And they walk over to two We Are Changers, and they say...
[00:14:39.605 --> 00:14:43.866]  Turn your camera off or we're gonna say it's a gun and that your backpack's a bomb.
[00:14:43.866 --> 00:14:50.447]  I knows it's not a gun, I knows it's not a bomb, but you got it to be 30 days in the hole.
[00:14:50.447 --> 00:14:56.688]  And then the detectives and the security people call over plainclothes cops who then grab the camera and say this is a gun.
[00:14:56.688 --> 00:14:59.249]  And then the cops didn't even erase the video.
[00:14:59.249 --> 00:15:03.970]  They finally submitted and agreed to leave and have their First Amendment violated and to submit to the tyranny.
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:11.404]  And so the cops were so arrogant, they let them leave with video of them threatening to frame them.
[00:15:11.404 --> 00:15:14.305]  A serious felony.
[00:15:14.305 --> 00:15:16.207]  And that's how criminal they are, folks.
[00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:20.729]  That's how accustomed to committing crime in broad daylight, on video.
[00:15:20.729 --> 00:15:23.471]  They didn't even care in New York.
[00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:31.355]  If a slave had video of them engaging in racketeering, engaging in extortion, violating someone's rights.
[00:15:31.355 --> 00:15:34.657]  I mean, literal civil rights violations.
[00:15:34.657 --> 00:15:41.302]  I mean, police, do you want your children living in a country where if people peacefully have a banner?
[00:15:42.284 --> 00:16:01.110]  Talking about the controlled implosion of Building 7, standing in front of the new Building 7, that Larry Silverstein has his thugs come out, retired New York police, backed up by police, and say on camera, Larry doesn't like you here, we're going to call in a bomb threat, which by the way is a serious felony.
[00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:06.111]  Under the Patriot Act, it's an act of terrorism.
[00:16:06.111 --> 00:16:08.272]  I mean, and then they are so evil!
[00:16:09.875 --> 00:16:12.757]  That they don't even care we've got the footage.
[00:16:12.757 --> 00:16:15.438]  That is the magnitude.
[00:16:15.438 --> 00:16:18.881]  And now in the future, we're not just gonna say it's a gun and a bum.
[00:16:18.881 --> 00:16:24.484]  Listen Mac, it's gonna be eavesdroppings on you.
[00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:27.986]  Never seen Bugs Bunny cartoons where he fights the gangsters.
[00:16:27.986 --> 00:16:35.131]  It's one of the few cartoons, I guess Yosemite Sam and they got Elmer Fudd, but it's just a few of the cartoons where it's a gangster and he's wearing those big hats.
[00:16:36.032 --> 00:16:38.633]  In fact, pull up, uh, Bugs Bunny Fights Gangsters.
[00:16:38.633 --> 00:16:41.435]  That should be on YouTube, or Bugs Bunny Gangsters.
[00:16:41.435 --> 00:16:45.557]  And they're like, yeah, listen, Rabbit, we know you's laying the golden eggs.
[00:16:45.557 --> 00:16:47.978]  I saw one episode of that when I was a kid.
[00:16:47.978 --> 00:16:51.519]  And you're gonna sit in here, Rabbit, and you're gonna lay the golden eggs.
[00:16:51.519 --> 00:16:53.941]  Yeah, listen, Doc, I'm not gonna lay the golden eggs.
[00:16:54.801 --> 00:17:02.607]  These guys talk more gangsterish, the police in New York, and I've run into them over and over again, than gangsters in movies.
[00:17:02.607 --> 00:17:08.032]  Growing up as a kid, I thought the caricatures of gangsters, like in The Godfather and other movies, were caricatures.
[00:17:08.032 --> 00:17:08.512]  No, no.
[00:17:08.512 --> 00:17:10.834]  It's worse than that, okay?
[00:17:10.834 --> 00:17:14.136]  Over and over again, I've been screamed at by police in New York.
[00:17:14.136 --> 00:17:21.863]  They'll come over to you, they'll start screaming at you, they'll ask you a question like they're a drill sergeant, and you'll even say, uh, well, no sir.
[00:17:22.443 --> 00:17:24.205]  Did I tell you to talk?
[00:17:24.205 --> 00:17:29.832]  This is in my film, Road Attorney, it's Martial Law, 911, Rise of the Police State.
[00:17:29.832 --> 00:17:31.233]  Did I tell you to talk?
[00:17:31.233 --> 00:17:32.195]  Shut up!
[00:17:32.195 --> 00:17:36.740]  So loud I won't even do the imitation, it'll hurt my throat.
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:37.641]  Just letting me know.
[00:17:38.542 --> 00:17:40.784]  You talk one more time, you're arrested!
[00:17:40.784 --> 00:17:50.951]  Just, just relishing domi- If you don't think that these cops will come take your farm, your ranch, your home, your business, your wife, your kids, you got another thing coming, okay?
[00:17:50.951 --> 00:17:53.713]  Now, I'm not saying every city's like this yet.
[00:17:53.713 --> 00:17:54.634]  Yet.
[00:17:54.634 --> 00:17:57.235]  But they will eat their guts and ask for seconds.
[00:17:57.235 --> 00:18:01.158]  They will do whatever they want, whenever they want.
[00:18:01.158 --> 00:18:06.102]  I had a group of over 200 New York police come out of an alleyway drunk.
[00:18:10.211 --> 00:18:13.093]  Drunk.
[00:18:13.093 --> 00:18:16.095]  And attack my cameraman and break a $6,000 camera.
[00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:18.977]  That's in.
[00:18:18.977 --> 00:18:19.618]  Truth rising.
[00:18:22.281 --> 00:18:36.532]  Just because we were having a 9-11 truth march, they were having some type of police party, with hundreds of police in uniform, come around the corner drunk and start assaulting us, with uniformed police backing them up, laughing.
[00:18:36.532 --> 00:18:37.593]  That's America!
[00:18:37.593 --> 00:18:49.002]  Goons with IQs at the level of room temperature, who literally have no idea what planet they're even on, who have a instinctive hatred for the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:18:49.562 --> 00:18:50.763]  Now, I'm going to tell you something.
[00:18:50.763 --> 00:18:51.603]  None of us are safe.
[00:18:51.603 --> 00:18:53.064]  And let me tell the cops something.
[00:18:53.064 --> 00:18:55.885]  You think your pension funds are safe when you've got this attitude?
[00:18:55.885 --> 00:19:00.368]  You think your private property's safe, buddy boy?
[00:19:00.368 --> 00:19:03.229]  Do you know what happens when a country gets cops like you?
[00:19:03.229 --> 00:19:09.692]  Do you know what happens when the elite are able to incrementally turn police into inhuman, mindless drones?
[00:19:09.692 --> 00:19:11.173]  The country collapses.
[00:19:11.173 --> 00:19:12.954]  The elites steal everything.
[00:19:12.954 --> 00:19:14.635]  Your children will have no future.
[00:19:14.635 --> 00:19:15.715]  Have some shame.
[00:19:15.715 --> 00:19:18.357]  You know, I've got shame for things I do.
[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.264]  Sometimes I listen to a rebroadcast of my show and I'm ashamed of things I say and do.
[00:19:23.264 --> 00:19:27.408]  None of us are perfect, but you've got to be able to have some shame.
[00:19:28.615 --> 00:19:34.260]  But no, that motorcycle rider you pulled over, who was already videotaping himself, on the side of the highway.
[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.382]  Yes, you know he has a full right.
[00:19:36.382 --> 00:19:40.807]  You are going to try to put him in jail for seven to ten years?
[00:19:40.807 --> 00:19:42.488]  He's not even human to you, are you?
[00:19:42.488 --> 00:19:44.470]  Eh, we teach these people a lesson.
[00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:47.353]  Eh, you know, we'll teach you a lesson, punk.
[00:19:47.353 --> 00:19:48.714]  Not to videotape us.
[00:19:48.714 --> 00:19:50.035]  You understand that?
[00:19:50.035 --> 00:19:52.217]  You are here to pay my paycheck.
[00:19:52.217 --> 00:19:52.678]  Period.
[00:19:53.118 --> 00:19:54.240]  Well, don't worry, cops.
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.642]  America's collapsing.
[00:19:55.642 --> 00:19:57.044]  The Golden Goose is dead.
[00:19:57.044 --> 00:19:58.467]  You helped the bankers kill it.
[00:19:58.467 --> 00:19:59.288]  Enjoy yourselves.
[00:19:59.288 --> 00:19:59.709]  We'll be back.
[00:20:00.819 --> 00:20:01.159]  Fact.
[00:20:01.159 --> 00:20:02.761]  4 million people in the U.S.
[00:20:02.761 --> 00:20:04.883]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[00:20:04.883 --> 00:20:05.403]  Fact.
[00:20:05.403 --> 00:20:09.086]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the 8th leading cause of death among Americans.
[00:20:09.086 --> 00:20:09.707]  Fact.
[00:20:09.707 --> 00:20:15.212]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[00:20:15.212 --> 00:20:15.572]  Fact.
[00:20:15.572 --> 00:20:20.056]  1 in 10 Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[00:20:20.056 --> 00:20:20.637]  Fact.
[00:20:20.637 --> 00:20:24.340]  Anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.

[00:21:59.994 --> 00:22:00.534]  Good day.
[00:22:00.534 --> 00:22:02.115]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:22:02.115 --> 00:22:02.676]  June 9th, 2010.
[00:22:02.676 --> 00:22:03.596]  Gold opened this morning at $1234.60.
[00:22:03.596 --> 00:22:07.659]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1267.45, $633.73 for a half-ounce, or $316.86 for a quarter-ounce.
[00:22:07.659 --> 00:22:07.839]  That's $1267.45,
[00:22:18.032 --> 00:22:18.792]  We're good to go.
[00:22:42.825 --> 00:22:46.248]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.

[00:22:52.254 --> 00:22:52.394]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.322 --> 00:23:09.845]  Nine years, thousands of clients worldwide, amazing results, and here's more proof of the effectiveness of how Heart and Body Extract supports good circulation and healthy arterial flow.
[00:23:09.845 --> 00:23:11.165]  My name is Crystal.
[00:23:11.165 --> 00:23:14.086]  I'm a 45-year-old and live in Houston, Texas.
[00:23:14.086 --> 00:23:18.047]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[00:23:18.047 --> 00:23:22.188]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[00:23:22.188 --> 00:23:23.028]  What did Crystal do?
[00:23:23.028 --> 00:23:25.449]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.
[00:23:26.969 --> 00:23:33.213]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.
[00:23:43.538 --> 00:23:44.399]  Let's do it!
[00:24:15.407 --> 00:24:17.410]  This is tyranny.
[00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:23.078]  I've got the New York Times here with their harassing and trying to shut down Amish everywhere saying they're bad for the environment.
[00:24:23.078 --> 00:24:28.906]  The environmental movement is about robbing you and making you a slave and making you dependent on government.
[00:24:28.906 --> 00:24:31.529]  Okay, the environmental leaders could care less about the environment.
[00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:32.490]  Okay?
[00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:38.612]  In fact, they're the transhumanists that head up all the genetic engineering and things that really do endanger this planet.
[00:24:38.612 --> 00:24:43.933]  It's all about making you feel guilty about yourself and hating yourself so they can take your property.
[00:24:43.933 --> 00:24:50.414]  And the police in this country need to know the nation is now in a engineered collapse.
[00:24:50.414 --> 00:24:56.336]  And you're going to be asked, you've been hyped up and trained to go after the American people and engage in pure tyranny.
[00:24:57.504 --> 00:25:09.114]  And you better decide today, you better get down on your knees and get right with God and ask yourself what side you're on.
[00:25:09.114 --> 00:25:12.696]  I know a lot of you are going to enjoy being thugs and you think you're on the winning team.
[00:25:12.696 --> 00:25:17.040]  You're going to find out in the end that you sold yourself out.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:22.905]  But for those of you that aren't bad men and women, you better grow up and recognize what you've been turned into.
[00:25:24.329 --> 00:25:27.971]  Now I know by and large a lot of police departments are good and most police are good.
[00:25:27.971 --> 00:25:34.095]  I've seen the statistics in the polls and I've seen the polls of 99% of cops being pro-gun.
[00:25:34.095 --> 00:25:38.458]  But your leadership is almost completely scum.
[00:25:38.458 --> 00:25:47.904]  That's why they've got all these national movements to demonize and MSNBC pieces to demonize moves for good county sheriffs to be elected.
[00:25:47.904 --> 00:25:50.506]  Or for patriots to take over the legislatures.
[00:25:50.506 --> 00:25:51.887]  That's how America's supposed to work.
[00:25:51.887 --> 00:25:53.528]  The people run the government.
[00:25:54.423 --> 00:25:56.350]  We decide the type of police we want.
[00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:57.373]  We decide the laws.
[00:25:57.373 --> 00:25:58.698]  You understand that?
[00:25:58.698 --> 00:26:00.323]  Not offshore New World Order banks!
[00:26:01.371 --> 00:26:03.232]  Alright, I'm already digressing off into police.
[00:26:03.232 --> 00:26:07.576]  I just, every couple days I read about them arresting somebody.
[00:26:07.576 --> 00:26:17.323]  There was one family I read about a month ago was just videotaping citizen spies that the police had spying on their neighbors.
[00:26:17.323 --> 00:26:19.684]  So people videotaped them and got arrested.
[00:26:19.684 --> 00:26:25.649]  Another case, people videotaped cops hiding on their own property with radar guns, so they arrested them.
[00:26:26.449 --> 00:26:30.932]  I mean, you know, the government's going to videotape you, but you're not going to videotape them.
[00:26:30.932 --> 00:26:32.472]  This is tyranny!
[00:26:32.472 --> 00:26:43.178]  Because video cameras are exposing police acting like out-of-control mad dog lunatics everywhere, and so now they want to try to set a precedent to arrest everyone.
[00:26:43.178 --> 00:26:48.501]  And they've now indicted, and this person's facing life in prison in the Army.
[00:26:48.501 --> 00:26:51.362]  I meant to get to that yesterday, in fact I will today.
[00:26:51.362 --> 00:26:52.023]  In fact, here it is.
[00:26:53.797 --> 00:26:58.259]  Soldier arrested in WikiLeaks classified Iraq video case.
[00:26:58.259 --> 00:27:03.102]  Army spec Bradley Manning has been arrested in connection with the April release of classified footage of a U.S.
[00:27:03.102 --> 00:27:05.703]  helicopter mistakenly shooting Iraqi civilians.
[00:27:05.703 --> 00:27:07.944]  You mean little girls?
[00:27:07.944 --> 00:27:08.464]  And the U.S.
[00:27:08.464 --> 00:27:12.846]  Army has arrested them and it's facing all sorts of charges.
[00:27:12.846 --> 00:27:14.687]  That's one thing.
[00:27:14.687 --> 00:27:17.849]  But in the past they didn't arrest people that exposed crime.
[00:27:19.076 --> 00:27:25.802]  You better watch out, ladies and gentlemen, when people that expose crimes are having the book thrown at them.
[00:27:25.802 --> 00:27:27.603]  They're arresting reporters now.
[00:27:27.603 --> 00:27:30.626]  The reporters that exposed that Bush was lying about WMDs?
[00:27:30.626 --> 00:27:34.409]  Arrested.
[00:27:34.409 --> 00:27:36.650]  Reporters that exposed 9-11 inside job?
[00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:38.672]  Arrested.
[00:27:38.672 --> 00:27:41.815]  Now they're announcing they want to shut down talk radio and free speech.
[00:27:41.815 --> 00:27:46.138]  Why does the average person out there driving along in their car going, I don't care, I'm not in the media.
[00:27:46.138 --> 00:27:47.700]  You know, you're trained to only care about yourself.
[00:27:49.053 --> 00:27:51.976]  I don't care if they shut down the media or arrest people.
[00:27:51.976 --> 00:27:53.177]  I just work at the factory.
[00:27:53.177 --> 00:27:55.539]  Yeah, how long are you going to have a factory job, pal?
[00:27:55.539 --> 00:28:02.006]  What about when the government wants you to go serve two, three months a year as slave labor under national service?
[00:28:02.006 --> 00:28:05.889]  Or wants to send you to another part of the country for a whole year for national service?
[00:28:05.889 --> 00:28:07.651]  You want to be busting rocks?
[00:28:07.651 --> 00:28:12.195]  Oh, when you say no, you're going to be beat up and arrested as a terrorist and then taken to that gulag.
[00:28:12.195 --> 00:28:13.417]  This is all being announced.
[00:28:13.968 --> 00:28:15.109]  You're like, really?
[00:28:15.109 --> 00:28:15.750]  Yes.
[00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:17.652]  They're announcing National Compulsory Service.
[00:28:17.652 --> 00:28:19.594]  It's in my film, The Obama Deception.
[00:28:19.594 --> 00:28:21.916]  We've seen all this before.
[00:28:21.916 --> 00:28:27.582]  The government has announced that it's going to give you tyranny on a silver platter, whether you like it or not.
[00:28:27.582 --> 00:28:37.732]  And if everybody just goes along with this, if you go along with naked body scanners, if you go along with them taking your baby's blood at birth and putting them in Pentagon databases, if you go along with them putting poison in your water to dumb you down and
[00:28:38.252 --> 00:28:39.293]  Sterilize you?
[00:28:39.293 --> 00:28:49.117]  If you go along with all of the corruption, if you go along with them setting these precedents, then they're going to go all the way.
[00:28:49.117 --> 00:28:55.519]  As Thomas Jefferson told you, every other country in world history falls to complete criminal tyranny.
[00:28:55.519 --> 00:28:57.000]  The sky is the limit.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.821]  These people enjoy dominating.
[00:28:59.721 --> 00:29:02.142]  And there isn't much time left.
[00:29:02.142 --> 00:29:05.864]  There isn't much time left to screw around.
[00:29:05.864 --> 00:29:06.465]  Okay?
[00:29:06.465 --> 00:29:13.569]  They are moving with classical hardcore tyranny with a high-tech integration right now and admitting it.
[00:29:14.298 --> 00:29:17.282]  Yeah, we record your naked children and your wife, and you.
[00:29:17.282 --> 00:29:18.223]  And yeah, we're saving it.
[00:29:18.223 --> 00:29:19.245]  What you gonna do about it?
[00:29:19.245 --> 00:29:21.308]  Yeah, we're gonna take your blood at checkpoints without warrants.
[00:29:21.308 --> 00:29:22.489]  What you gonna do about it?
[00:29:22.489 --> 00:29:23.831]  Yeah, we're setting up tyranny.
[00:29:23.831 --> 00:29:25.213]  What you gonna do about it?
[00:29:25.213 --> 00:29:26.895]  Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do about it.
[00:29:26.895 --> 00:29:31.702]  I'm gonna rally the American people to attempt to peacefully, legislatively take our government back.
[00:29:32.602 --> 00:29:34.923]  And then we're going to have a big enough number of people that are awake.
[00:29:34.923 --> 00:29:37.904]  When you try your violence against us, it's not going to work.
[00:29:37.904 --> 00:29:38.944]  You understand that?
[00:29:38.944 --> 00:29:40.445]  So that's what's coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:40.445 --> 00:29:48.708]  I'm going to blitz through news on the economy, on Bin Laden, supposedly, in Iran now.
[00:29:48.708 --> 00:29:49.948]  It is all coming up.
[00:29:49.948 --> 00:29:50.649]  You'll want to stay with us.
[00:29:50.649 --> 00:29:51.989]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.989 --> 00:29:54.510]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:57.211]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.773 --> 00:30:04.316]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:04.316 --> 00:30:05.236]  Number 1.
[00:30:05.236 --> 00:30:08.659]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:08.659 --> 00:30:09.519]  Number 2.
[00:30:09.519 --> 00:30:14.402]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:14.402 --> 00:30:15.143]  It's true.
[00:30:15.143 --> 00:30:20.026]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.026 --> 00:30:20.846]  Number 3.
[00:30:20.846 --> 00:30:24.429]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:24.429 --> 00:30:28.111]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:28.331 --> 00:30:29.131]  Number 4.
[00:30:29.131 --> 00:30:31.892]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:31.892 --> 00:30:35.574]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:35.574 --> 00:30:36.354]  Number 5.
[00:30:36.354 --> 00:30:40.516]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:40.516 --> 00:30:45.558]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:31:23.647 --> 00:31:30.172]  Since 1947, Calvin's Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[00:31:30.172 --> 00:31:31.674]  Buy American and stay clean.

[00:31:53.032 --> 00:31:53.472]  Thank you!
[00:31:59.304 --> 00:32:01.685]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:32:01.685 --> 00:32:03.906]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:32:03.906 --> 00:32:07.228]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:32:07.228 --> 00:32:12.330]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:16.532]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:32:16.832 --> 00:32:19.194]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:32:19.194 --> 00:32:21.735]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:32:21.735 --> 00:32:24.997]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:32:24.997 --> 00:32:32.602]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:32:32.938 --> 00:32:38.320]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:41.161]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:32:41.161 --> 00:32:44.843]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:32:44.843 --> 00:32:45.923]  And I got news for you.
[00:32:45.923 --> 00:32:47.264]  You're everyone else.
[00:32:47.264 --> 00:32:48.764]  Invisible Empire.

[00:33:01.376 --> 00:33:07.202]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:07.202 --> 00:33:11.986]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:11.986 --> 00:33:19.473]  Land of the free, home of the brave was the best place in the world because we had a Bill of Rights and Constitution and no man was a slave to government.
[00:33:19.473 --> 00:33:21.736]  Every man and woman's home was their castle.
[00:33:22.728 --> 00:33:23.288]  Not anymore.
[00:33:23.288 --> 00:33:25.249]  The government's going to look through your walls with infrared.
[00:33:25.249 --> 00:33:27.950]  They're going to listen to your phone calls, track everything you do.
[00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:36.052]  But you point a camera out of your own window at cops 300 yards away beating some kid half to death, you're going to go to prison.
[00:33:36.052 --> 00:33:37.933]  Because this isn't land of the free, home of the brave.
[00:33:37.933 --> 00:33:44.255]  This is land of worship, the black ski mask that serves the banker that's going to take everything you got.
[00:33:44.255 --> 00:33:49.037]  And you're going to pay thousands of trillions of dollars of interest to the bankers.
[00:33:49.037 --> 00:33:50.457]  And they're going to rule you.
[00:33:50.457 --> 00:33:51.598]  Do you understand?
[00:33:52.523 --> 00:34:06.358]  And you're supposed to click your heels and say, yes sir, and take your vaccine shots, and take your mercury injections, and take your cancer virus injections.
[00:34:06.358 --> 00:34:11.843]  I mean, look at this ridiculous propaganda.
[00:34:11.843 --> 00:34:14.866]  Osama Bin Laden and top aides are hiding in
[00:34:16.613 --> 00:34:17.433]  Iran.
[00:34:17.433 --> 00:34:27.097]  I've been hearing this for the last month, and this is put out by the Debka file, a well-known Israeli front, and they might as well say that Marvin the Martian is hanging out in Iran.
[00:34:27.097 --> 00:34:28.438]  I mean, they might as well.
[00:34:28.438 --> 00:34:31.539]  Israel is hell-bent on starting World War III.
[00:34:31.539 --> 00:34:39.522]  And so are the Iranians, saying they're going to send an armed escort with the flotilla in the Mediterranean that isn't even in their sphere of influence or their region.
[00:34:40.390 --> 00:34:43.892]  No, they're on the borders of Asia, not Europe.
[00:34:43.892 --> 00:34:45.573]  I mean, what is Iran looking for?
[00:34:45.573 --> 00:34:48.035]  What is Israel looking for?
[00:34:48.035 --> 00:34:51.997]  Both sides disgust me.
[00:34:51.997 --> 00:34:54.318]  It is unbelievable that this is going on.
[00:34:54.318 --> 00:35:03.964]  And remember what the Washington Post reported just two weeks ago in spy talk.
[00:35:03.964 --> 00:35:04.705]  Remember the headline?
[00:35:06.275 --> 00:35:18.760]  CIA units wacky idea depicts Saddam as gay, but buried within the article, and we have excised pieces of that in our article, former CIA officials admit to faking bin Laden video.
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.921]  I've got news for you, they're all fakes.
[00:35:20.921 --> 00:35:25.563]  Even the real ones are admittedly recuts of stuff from 99, 2000, 2001.
[00:35:25.563 --> 00:35:26.864]  They just recut it.
[00:35:26.864 --> 00:35:28.164]  I mean, of course they do.
[00:35:28.164 --> 00:35:30.345]  I first pointed that out before it was admitted.
[00:35:30.345 --> 00:35:32.946]  You could see it was old videos, the same video.
[00:35:32.946 --> 00:35:33.926]  But they think you're stupid.
[00:35:33.926 --> 00:35:35.067]  They think you're not paying attention.
[00:35:39.414 --> 00:35:49.661]  And it goes on, the agency actually did make a video purporting to show Osama Bin Laden and his cronies sitting around a campfire, swigging bottles of liquor and savoring their conquest with boys.
[00:35:49.661 --> 00:35:59.908]  One of the former CIA officers recalled, chuckling at the memory, the actors were drawn from some of us, some of our darker-skinned employees, he said.
[00:35:59.908 --> 00:36:02.950]  Yeah, who they were probably actually having fun with.
[00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:04.330]  That's kind of a CIA thing, I guess.
[00:36:05.646 --> 00:36:06.867]  That's what Washington's all about.
[00:36:06.867 --> 00:36:12.251]  I guess they've had too many women, they're bored with it, but they say that's the way that goes.
[00:36:12.251 --> 00:36:20.658]  CIA unit's wacky idea depicting Saddam as gay, and then down in the article they just admit, oh yeah, oh yeah, we fake videos.
[00:36:20.658 --> 00:36:22.119]  Well, of course they do.
[00:36:22.119 --> 00:36:24.861]  And now they don't even fake videos.
[00:36:24.861 --> 00:36:33.508]  They just say, hey, the Israelis say that the Sunni, arch-enemy of the Shiites, is hanging out in Iran.
[00:36:38.405 --> 00:36:40.186]  Absolutely asinine.
[00:36:40.186 --> 00:36:52.872]  And meanwhile, for four years, the White House admitted under Bush, and now Obama, that four different terrorist groups, three of them Al-Qaeda, real Wahhabist Al-Qaeda out of Saudi Arabia, are inside Iran carrying out targeted bombings.
[00:36:52.872 --> 00:36:58.395]  And our government admits they're bombing Iran, and Iran sits there and takes it.
[00:36:58.395 --> 00:37:00.036]  That's a smart move.
[00:37:00.036 --> 00:37:01.337]  Unless they want nukes raining down.
[00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:06.475]  It's meant to be a provocation, and now Ahmadinejad says, I'm going to send ships.
[00:37:06.475 --> 00:37:16.969]  You're letting the CIA bomb you, wisely, not responding, unless you want to be totally blown to bits, which is what the globalists want.
[00:37:16.969 --> 00:37:18.591]  But then you're going to send ships with a flotilla.
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:21.861]  I hope that's just rhetoric.
[00:37:21.861 --> 00:37:27.124]  Osama bin Laden and top aides are hiding in Iran.
[00:37:27.124 --> 00:37:31.667]  Osama bin Laden's hiding place was pinned down for the first time Monday.
[00:37:31.667 --> 00:37:35.489]  Oh yes, eight and a half years after 9-11, they've pinned it down.
[00:37:35.489 --> 00:37:35.689]  Sure.
[00:37:36.921 --> 00:37:40.524]  Is he at the American Hospital in Dubai like he was according to mainstream news?
[00:37:40.524 --> 00:37:42.746]  Were the CIA officers there with him right before 9-11?
[00:37:42.746 --> 00:37:46.789]  You mean... Oh no, he's in Iran, I forgot.
[00:37:46.789 --> 00:37:49.832]  He's not a known CIA asset codenamed Tim Osman.
[00:37:49.832 --> 00:38:03.383]  Osama Bin Laden's hiding place was pinned down for the first time Monday, June 7th, by Kuwait Al-Siasa Monday, June 7th, as the mountains town of
[00:38:04.751 --> 00:38:13.364]  Savva Zavar in the northeastern Iranian province 220 kilometers west of Mashhad.
[00:38:13.364 --> 00:38:18.351]  He is said to have lived there under Tehran's protection for at least five years along with
[00:38:20.211 --> 00:38:25.874]  A man Al-Zawahiri and five other high-ranking Al-Qaeda leaders.
[00:38:25.874 --> 00:38:36.821]  Debka File's intelligence source disclosed Monday night that Turkey's Prime Minister and his intelligence chiefs are well aware that Bin Laden is hiding in Iran.
[00:38:36.821 --> 00:38:39.222]  Oh, so now Turkey's involved with Al-Qaeda.
[00:38:39.222 --> 00:38:40.783]  Member of NATO, yes.
[00:38:40.783 --> 00:38:43.325]  And Easter bunnies are piloting flying saucers right now.
[00:38:44.065 --> 00:38:46.646]  They're delivering happy meals to your door.
[00:38:46.646 --> 00:38:49.907]  Notice that they say Kuwait-based news is reporting this.
[00:38:49.907 --> 00:38:54.448]  The same Kuwaiti news that reported that Saddam was there throwing babies out of incubators.
[00:38:54.448 --> 00:39:02.191]  And it turns out the woman testifying had never lived in Kuwait and was the daughter of the PR firm paid millions of dollars to lie.
[00:39:03.911 --> 00:39:04.591]  Oh, that's it.
[00:39:04.591 --> 00:39:06.873]  Saddam was throwing babies out of incubators.
[00:39:06.873 --> 00:39:11.016]  And now, oh, Iran's got Al-Qaeda.
[00:39:11.016 --> 00:39:12.557]  It's there.
[00:39:12.557 --> 00:39:26.966]  We're supposed to believe this from a CIA that thinks we're so dumb and has such disdain and disrespect and contempt for the public that they laugh at you in a laughing tone in the Washington Post and say, yeah, we fake videos for you idiots.
[00:39:26.966 --> 00:39:27.727]  And, oh yes,
[00:39:28.789 --> 00:39:35.853]  Fox News with Roldo Rivera, Mr. Handlebar Mustache, sits up there and goes, let's talk to the Marine Corps Colonel.
[00:39:35.853 --> 00:39:37.734]  Colonel, you're here helping them grow the opium.
[00:39:37.734 --> 00:39:39.495]  You don't like that, but it's what you got to do.
[00:39:39.495 --> 00:39:43.277]  Well, it's their culture, and if we don't, Al-Qaeda will get the money.
[00:39:43.277 --> 00:39:45.598]  No discussion of why are you flying it out?
[00:39:45.598 --> 00:39:46.999]  Where is it going?
[00:39:46.999 --> 00:39:48.880]  You know, why don't you buy it from them and burn it?
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:49.320]  No.
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:52.361]  No discussion of why is there a 12-plus fold increase in the production?
[00:39:53.582 --> 00:39:55.224]  Or how the Russians are complaining the U.S.
[00:39:55.224 --> 00:39:57.727]  is shipping it into Russia, 30,000 deaths a year.
[00:39:57.727 --> 00:40:02.172]  Or how all this super hardcore heroin is hitting the U.S., people are having overdoses.
[00:40:02.172 --> 00:40:02.692]  No.
[00:40:02.692 --> 00:40:06.676]  Or no headlines about our troops getting addicted to heroin.
[00:40:06.676 --> 00:40:07.397]  No problem.
[00:40:07.397 --> 00:40:09.580]  Just, yeah, chump public.
[00:40:10.526 --> 00:40:12.367]  We are growing the opium.
[00:40:12.367 --> 00:40:14.388]  We're making fake Al-Qaeda videos.
[00:40:14.388 --> 00:40:17.790]  Sit down and shut up and give us those bank accounts.
[00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:20.091]  They're a bunch of lawless pirates running things.
[00:40:20.091 --> 00:40:21.511]  And why shouldn't they steal everything?
[00:40:21.511 --> 00:40:27.454]  Why shouldn't they laugh and admit they're taking your baby's blood at birth and naked body scanning you and spiking your water with poisons?
[00:40:27.454 --> 00:40:29.975]  Why shouldn't they admit the GMO crops are sterilizing you?
[00:40:29.975 --> 00:40:31.636]  Why shouldn't they admit how they're raping you?
[00:40:31.636 --> 00:40:32.176]  Why not?
[00:40:32.176 --> 00:40:32.957]  You like it.
[00:40:32.957 --> 00:40:35.058]  You are the land of the cowards, home of the slaves.
[00:40:36.567 --> 00:40:38.109]  Well, actually you're not.
[00:40:38.109 --> 00:40:46.379]  You're waking up, you're getting angry, every incumbent's being thrown out of office, the system is panicking, and I'm telling you they're getting ready to stage false flag attacks.
[00:40:46.379 --> 00:40:52.947]  In fact, I heard them last night on the radio reading the quotes of the judge when she ordered the last Atari person released.
[00:40:52.947 --> 00:40:54.890]  Will you guys print me the latest on the Atari militia?
[00:40:57.250 --> 00:41:01.812]  And it was quotes, to paraphrase, you know, the feds have involved in fraud.
[00:41:01.812 --> 00:41:03.993]  No one was, you know, this is a fantasy.
[00:41:03.993 --> 00:41:05.834]  No one was planning to attack the police.
[00:41:05.834 --> 00:41:08.835]  You know, this is a dangerous precedent.
[00:41:08.835 --> 00:41:10.256]  I'm ordering them released.
[00:41:10.256 --> 00:41:13.257]  This is all a hoax.
[00:41:13.257 --> 00:41:15.618]  Those were the type of quotes coming out of the judge.
[00:41:15.618 --> 00:41:17.919]  It was a total hoax.
[00:41:17.919 --> 00:41:24.622]  And who told you in August of last year, eight months before Attari got arrested, that they were going to target Attari?
[00:41:24.622 --> 00:41:24.882]  I did.
[00:41:26.368 --> 00:41:34.335]  I could take one look at those Hitari videos and tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that comes directly out of Government Central Casting.
[00:41:34.335 --> 00:41:36.336]  Directly!
[00:41:36.336 --> 00:41:51.429]  I mean, you can tell a movie... I mean, it wasn't hard the day I saw the fat Bin Laden with a new nose and he suddenly gained 150 pounds, that that wasn't Bin Laden and they had the camera blurred on purpose, thinking you were stupid.
[00:41:51.429 --> 00:41:53.731]  That's the footage with the supposed young boys around him.
[00:41:55.926 --> 00:41:59.388]  And then linguists listened to it and said it's not even a Saudi Arabian dialect.
[00:41:59.388 --> 00:42:01.689]  Then they did a voice print of it and it wasn't him.
[00:42:01.689 --> 00:42:02.530]  Wasn't him!
[00:42:02.530 --> 00:42:04.171]  Now they laugh and admit it wasn't him.
[00:42:04.171 --> 00:42:05.452]  Of course it wasn't him!
[00:42:05.452 --> 00:42:07.293]  I don't need a linguist.
[00:42:07.293 --> 00:42:10.075]  I don't need a voice print.
[00:42:10.075 --> 00:42:12.217]  I can look at a video and tell you if it's fake.
[00:42:13.148 --> 00:42:25.138]  Let me tell you something, that underwear bombing video they showed where for one second, he turns his face and the guy's wearing a hood, you see the dark shadow around the face, like it's Obi-Wan Kenobi, like it's a specter, and you can see that face superimposed over it.
[00:42:25.138 --> 00:42:28.200]  These guys aren't even good at faking video.
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:28.821]  This is like a 1980s video.
[00:42:31.633 --> 00:42:33.294]  The video's like a shimmering specter.
[00:42:33.294 --> 00:42:42.722]  It looks like Obi-Wan Kenobi whenever Luke Skywalker's reaching up after he's escaped the snow beast and he sees Obi-Wan Kenobi there as a phantom.
[00:42:42.722 --> 00:42:45.945]  I mean, it literally is like a phantom hologram.
[00:42:45.945 --> 00:42:47.807]  They don't even make good fakes.
[00:42:47.807 --> 00:42:49.648]  Their fake videos aren't good.
[00:42:49.648 --> 00:42:51.130]  The Intel Center is so lazy.
[00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:54.972]  Openly run by former heads of CIA propaganda black ops publicly.
[00:42:54.972 --> 00:42:59.395]  They don't even have, you know, somebody in there who doesn't have a history of intelligence ops.
[00:42:59.395 --> 00:43:06.380]  And they put the Al Qaeda logo in the same video layer as the Intel Center logo.
[00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:16.767]  Any moron could blow it up on the screen and see it was in the same pixel layer.
[00:43:16.767 --> 00:43:18.688]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[00:43:20.208 --> 00:43:23.410]  And it goes on and on and on.
[00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:26.393]  You see, they know you want to believe the lie.
[00:43:26.393 --> 00:43:31.536]  You want to believe there's a brown-skinned guy with a big turban who's going to get you.
[00:43:31.536 --> 00:43:34.258]  They know at a red-blooded level you want to kill somebody who's foreign.
[00:43:34.258 --> 00:43:34.879]  You know, it's tribal.
[00:43:36.417 --> 00:43:37.158]  Okay, whatever.
[00:43:37.158 --> 00:43:47.406]  The point is they dangle this literal Hollywood production in front of you, and now they're telling you that he is in Iran, and he is going to get you.
[00:43:47.406 --> 00:43:58.014]  While in the real world, the White House is so arrogant, it puts out press releases bragging, enlisting the terror groups that are attacking Iran, and all of them are real Al-Qaeda.
[00:43:58.014 --> 00:44:00.616]  Because real Al-Qaeda is CIADA.
[00:44:00.616 --> 00:44:02.617]  Al-CIADA.
[00:44:02.617 --> 00:44:04.219]  And that's just the facts.
[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:23.481]  I mean, I had Ray McGovern on three, four years ago when they blew up the Golden Mosque, and he said his intel sources, a high-level former CIA, said that they shut the mosque down for four hours, wired the whole thing with C4, and blew the Golden Dome off of it, one of the most holy sites in Iraq, to get the Shiites and Sunnis killing each other.
[00:44:24.102 --> 00:44:33.671]  And they went out and said, you know, that, oh, the Shiites did this massacre and the Sunnis did this one to get a literal war going as a pretext to keep our troops there.
[00:44:33.671 --> 00:44:37.114]  And then as soon as they wanted to stop that, they stopped blowing up mosques.
[00:44:37.114 --> 00:44:38.775]  And all the locals saw U.S.
[00:44:38.775 --> 00:44:42.639]  forces, and it later came out in mainstream news, at the back of the paper, saw U.S.
[00:44:42.639 --> 00:44:48.344]  forces go in, clear the mosque, wire it, pull out, and blow it up in front of everyone.
[00:44:48.644 --> 00:44:54.406]  They think you're so dumb, they blow mosque up in front of everyone to get the Muslims murdering each other.
[00:44:54.406 --> 00:44:56.386]  Remember the London Guardian?
[00:44:56.386 --> 00:44:58.007]  It was confirmed.
[00:44:58.007 --> 00:45:13.551]  Basra, Iraqi police put in by the British, caught British SAS, Special Forces, assigned to MI6, dressed up, running around shooting and bombing, dressed up with fake beards, dressed up as Sunnis attacking Shiite areas of Basra.
[00:45:14.741 --> 00:45:20.990]  It was total, and they arrested him, they were able to get him, and they took him, and then what did the British do?
[00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:27.820]  They openly assaulted the Iraqi police station and freed them, but not before photos got out of them with their beards off.
[00:45:28.612 --> 00:45:29.353]  Totally fake.
[00:45:29.353 --> 00:45:30.874]  It's all fake.
[00:45:30.874 --> 00:45:32.835]  It's all fake, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:32.835 --> 00:45:35.297]  Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake.
[00:45:35.297 --> 00:45:39.280]  Why do you think there's so many IEDs killing our troops over there?
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:43.022]  Why are they telling our police that we're about to have IED attacks all over America?
[00:45:43.022 --> 00:45:57.332]  Because that's something that black ops and private corporations and merc groups can go do IEDs in Iraq and Afghanistan and the United States to make the troops have high morale and hate the enemy, which is imaginary.
[00:45:57.332 --> 00:45:57.913]  You understand that?
[00:45:58.797 --> 00:46:00.058]  You understand that?
[00:46:00.058 --> 00:46:05.564]  See, they know during the Blitz that people that get bombed get more angry.
[00:46:05.564 --> 00:46:08.027]  And so there's not really any real enemies attacking.
[00:46:09.124 --> 00:46:12.585]  You've got to go out and plant IEDs to kill our own troops.
[00:46:12.585 --> 00:46:15.826]  How many times have they caught firefighters planting pipe bombs in the U.S.
[00:46:15.826 --> 00:46:17.266]  or burning down buildings for attention?
[00:46:17.266 --> 00:46:19.606]  Well, this is a lot worse than that.
[00:46:19.606 --> 00:46:24.047]  Large portions of the bombings and shootings were carried out by private mercs.
[00:46:24.047 --> 00:46:29.429]  The mercs, many of them, are there to kill our own troops and to set up roadside bombs.
[00:46:29.429 --> 00:46:29.969]  You understand that?
[00:46:30.669 --> 00:46:31.609]  You understand that?
[00:46:31.609 --> 00:46:43.034]  Because if you're going to have a war in the Middle East and Central Asia where private firms are making half a trillion dollars a year off the books, not to mention the drug money, they've got to have a reason to be there.
[00:46:43.034 --> 00:46:46.416]  They've got to have some body counts.
[00:46:46.416 --> 00:46:52.118]  The truth is body counts in many cases actually raise morale and make people want to fight and kill and go back.
[00:46:53.131 --> 00:46:53.811]  You understand?
[00:46:53.811 --> 00:46:58.773]  And then there is some real insurgents, there are some real groups fighting, but mainly it's sectarian.
[00:46:58.773 --> 00:47:08.737]  Every time that got stirred up between Sunni and Shiite, every time the globalists blew up a new mosque or killed a new religious leader, then our troops got stuck in the middle of it.
[00:47:08.737 --> 00:47:15.359]  Then, as I told you years before it happened, they flipped the switch and turned off a lot of the sectarian violence.
[00:47:16.738 --> 00:47:17.818]  It's all rigged.
[00:47:17.818 --> 00:47:19.959]  And they say, oh look, we've got less fighting now.
[00:47:19.959 --> 00:47:21.520]  Well of course you've got less fighting.
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:26.522]  You don't have British, US and Israeli, and other private contractors.
[00:47:26.522 --> 00:47:31.164]  In fact, they've caught Afghans shipped in on C-130s to Iraq.
[00:47:31.164 --> 00:47:32.405]  That's come out in mainstream news.
[00:47:34.056 --> 00:47:37.060]  You understand, folks, this is all staged.
[00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:39.202]  This is all staged.
[00:47:39.202 --> 00:47:42.426]  Staged, staged, staged, staged, staged.
[00:47:42.426 --> 00:47:44.309]  And they try to take our power away from us.
[00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:45.650]  I expose it's fake videos.
[00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:47.412]  I expose it's fake video layers.
[00:47:47.412 --> 00:47:49.255]  We expose all their fraud.
[00:47:49.255 --> 00:47:50.957]  We expose their shipping opium out of the country.
[00:47:50.957 --> 00:47:52.779]  So they just come in and say, yeah, we're doing it, big deal.
[00:47:52.779 --> 00:47:53.280]  Let's move on.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:53.520]  Come on.
[00:47:55.643 --> 00:48:03.811]  And they know the average good old boy, who's a well-meaning person, just wants to hate foreigners and feel like America's still America.
[00:48:03.811 --> 00:48:09.156]  You know, I may not have my pension fund, the bankers may be ripping me off, but at least we're killing Hodges.
[00:48:09.156 --> 00:48:13.660]  At least I can go watch a great movie like The Hurt Locker.
[00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:17.344]  By the way, The Hurt Locker was shot much of it in Iraq.
[00:48:17.344 --> 00:48:18.385]  It was embedded.
[00:48:18.385 --> 00:48:19.766]  That thing is a psy-op,
[00:48:20.489 --> 00:48:27.611]  You know, at the end of the movie, the ultimate hero, the coolest guy, signs back up for his fourth tour of Bomb Disposal.
[00:48:27.611 --> 00:48:28.711]  And he's a wild man.
[00:48:28.711 --> 00:48:29.451]  He's a hero.
[00:48:29.451 --> 00:48:30.851]  He's a John Wayne.
[00:48:30.851 --> 00:48:32.412]  You know, he's never going to stop.
[00:48:32.412 --> 00:48:38.893]  It's so exciting when those helicopters land at the end and he goes walking off, you know, to serve his fifth tour.
[00:48:38.893 --> 00:48:41.033]  He tells his son, I don't even love you.
[00:48:41.033 --> 00:48:44.134]  His wife, I don't even care about you.
[00:48:44.134 --> 00:48:45.694]  And it's a beautiful thing.
[00:48:45.694 --> 00:48:48.275]  He says, you know, as you get older, you only love
[00:48:49.733 --> 00:48:51.034]  A few things.
[00:48:51.034 --> 00:48:52.334]  And now I don't even love two things.
[00:48:52.334 --> 00:48:53.955]  I only love one thing.
[00:48:53.955 --> 00:49:00.539]  And he basically tells his son he's like a worthless jack-in-the-box and leaves him to go back to war for adrenaline.
[00:49:00.539 --> 00:49:01.819]  And he's the hero.
[00:49:01.819 --> 00:49:03.300]  That's a good thing.
[00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:05.361]  Just like they teach you torture's good.
[00:49:05.361 --> 00:49:07.762]  Just like they teach you all this is good.
[00:49:07.762 --> 00:49:12.425]  No, the reason those guys that have served two, three, four, five tours want to go back is because they're screwed up.
[00:49:14.656 --> 00:49:18.457]  Because it is boring to go to the supermarket and buy cereal.
[00:49:18.457 --> 00:49:19.317]  It is boring.
[00:49:19.317 --> 00:49:21.697]  That's why most of them want to come back and be cops.
[00:49:21.697 --> 00:49:25.318]  But instead of fighting hajis, as they call them, they're pulling your wife over.
[00:49:25.318 --> 00:49:27.598]  They're pulling your 17-year-old kid over.
[00:49:27.598 --> 00:49:32.439]  And your 17-year-old kid's driving back from the gym, and he's got his weight belt in the front seat of his car.
[00:49:32.439 --> 00:49:40.861]  So the cop who's just been back after four tours pulls his gun and blows your son's head off and then plants a gun on you because he had no business being a cop
[00:49:41.061 --> 00:49:55.217]  Because he's a screwed up fruit loop from four or five tours in hardcore combat and all of the basic army psychologists knew by World War II that you don't put somebody in more than one tour because there's no coming back for them.
[00:49:55.217 --> 00:49:57.579]  They're completely fried.
[00:49:57.579 --> 00:49:58.440]  They need instant
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:01.101]  Threat every day.
[00:50:01.101 --> 00:50:03.322]  They need war.
[00:50:03.322 --> 00:50:04.242]  They need death.
[00:50:04.242 --> 00:50:05.163]  They need carnage.
[00:50:05.163 --> 00:50:07.844]  This is what they've converted to.
[00:50:07.844 --> 00:50:09.325]  It's what they expect.
[00:50:09.325 --> 00:50:12.106]  There's no coming back from that.
[00:50:12.106 --> 00:50:16.588]  The globalists admit Iraq is a big laboratory to create.
[00:50:16.588 --> 00:50:17.769]  Iraq is a prison planet.
[00:50:19.062 --> 00:50:20.844]  It's like in the Dune novels.
[00:50:20.844 --> 00:50:29.773]  It's like Seleucus Secundus, where they send the forces to live for a decade in hell and then the survivors are brought back to police the empire.
[00:50:29.773 --> 00:50:33.316]  Well, that's what the Pentagon actually says these wars are.
[00:50:33.316 --> 00:50:35.599]  It's to create your rulers!
[00:50:35.599 --> 00:50:37.120]  It's to create the people.
[00:50:37.921 --> 00:50:40.564]  When the war is over, who can wage war on you?
[00:50:40.564 --> 00:50:54.740]  And that's why they've got these IED guys in every police department teaching that the IED bombings are coming, because the feds are going to bomb the local police and tell them that the local gun owners did it, and the local police are then going to come and grab you and torture the living daylights out of you.
[00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:58.143]  This is the new secret police cohorts being set up in the United States.
[00:50:58.143 --> 00:50:59.285]  You understand how the PSYOP works?
[00:51:02.417 --> 00:51:05.059]  You're arrested and you're subject to other police action.
[00:51:05.059 --> 00:51:06.320]  Tyranny is here.
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:10.063]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:51:10.063 --> 00:51:12.486]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:51:12.486 --> 00:51:18.351]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:51:18.351 --> 00:51:24.556]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:51:25.006 --> 00:51:30.988]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:51:30.988 --> 00:51:35.169]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:51:35.169 --> 00:51:39.451]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:51:39.451 --> 00:51:45.393]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:51:45.393 --> 00:51:48.954]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:51:48.954 --> 00:51:50.935]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:51:50.935 --> 00:51:51.375]  It's here.

[00:53:01.582 --> 00:53:03.604]  Remain in your houses.
[00:53:03.604 --> 00:53:09.368]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[00:53:09.368 --> 00:53:10.728]  Will they do it?
[00:53:10.728 --> 00:53:13.330]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[00:53:13.330 --> 00:53:19.795]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[00:53:19.795 --> 00:53:21.036]  Think it can't happen here?
[00:53:21.996 --> 00:53:26.259]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[00:53:26.259 --> 00:53:31.141]  Executive Order 10-995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[00:53:31.141 --> 00:53:36.064]  Executive Order 10-998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[00:53:36.064 --> 00:53:40.887]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[00:53:41.787 --> 00:53:50.213]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.

[00:53:55.777 --> 00:53:58.699]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[00:54:07.592 --> 00:54:23.097]  Look at your young men fighting Look at your women crying Look at your young men dying The way they've always done before Dying for the elites!
[00:54:23.097 --> 00:54:33.680]  You know, Napoleon, just 220 years ago or so, or even less, just about 200 years ago, learned that men would give up their lives for little pieces of metal.
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:35.001]  He's the guy that invented metals.
[00:54:37.114 --> 00:54:38.496]  Oh, here, you did a good job.
[00:54:38.496 --> 00:54:42.059]  You get a little trinket, which is a sign of rank.
[00:54:42.059 --> 00:54:53.131]  That's why 5,000 years ago, native priests, no matter where it was in Europe, Mesoamerica, Asia, wore big feathers, big crowns.
[00:54:53.131 --> 00:54:54.852]  Every culture wore crowns.
[00:54:54.852 --> 00:54:56.054]  That means this is the king.
[00:54:56.054 --> 00:54:57.015]  This person's better than you.
[00:54:59.158 --> 00:55:06.060]  Then they built castles where the ruling elite could live and have this imposing facade against the commoners who lived outside the castle.
[00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:10.381]  And now look at government buildings built like fortresses against us, the slaves.
[00:55:10.381 --> 00:55:15.662]  It's a ruling culture, a ruling system of manipulation.
[00:55:15.662 --> 00:55:20.203]  And they don't want you to learn how they operate and how they manipulate you.
[00:55:20.203 --> 00:55:23.924]  Notice our government won't protect the borders, the government won't defend our sovereignty.
[00:55:23.924 --> 00:55:25.624]  It demonizes our sovereignty.
[00:55:26.818 --> 00:55:32.342]  And it quietly demonizes returning veterans who don't join the police force.
[00:55:32.342 --> 00:55:33.483]  They want your guns.
[00:55:33.483 --> 00:55:34.764]  They list you as terrorists.
[00:55:34.764 --> 00:55:35.984]  They demonize you.
[00:55:35.984 --> 00:55:39.146]  They cut your Medicare and Medicaid and VA funding.
[00:55:39.146 --> 00:55:40.988]  They don't like you.
[00:55:40.988 --> 00:55:49.293]  Once you've served them, they have disdained for you because they're cowardly, pot-bellied globalists.
[00:55:49.293 --> 00:55:55.378]  And they think you're so dumb, they tell you, that Mr. CIA, on-record CIA, Osama bin Laden,
[00:55:56.383 --> 00:56:01.525]  He is now in Iran, so we have to have World War III with them.
[00:56:01.525 --> 00:56:06.406]  Right as there is a global financial meltdown, they need a new war.
[00:56:06.406 --> 00:56:07.847]  What have we been telling you for years?
[00:56:07.847 --> 00:56:13.509]  When they orchestrated the financial derivatives meltdown, they would try to start World War III with Iran.
[00:56:13.509 --> 00:56:16.650]  But the Rand Corporation said that wasn't enough two years ago.
[00:56:16.650 --> 00:56:18.531]  We have an article at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:56:18.531 --> 00:56:25.433]  They said we need a multi-level, multi-region war, bigger than the last two Iraq invasions, similar to World War II.
[00:56:29.286 --> 00:56:31.487]  And what's happening now in the Korean Peninsula?
[00:56:31.487 --> 00:56:34.347]  See, they flicked a switch.
[00:56:34.347 --> 00:56:41.089]  They flick a switch and suddenly all Hades breaks loose.
[00:56:41.089 --> 00:56:44.170]  Now we've got amazing guests coming up at studio.
[00:56:44.170 --> 00:56:51.331]  Filmmakers to talk about their 10-hour film.
[00:56:51.331 --> 00:56:53.272]  And of course I'm in it, many others are in it.
[00:56:54.594 --> 00:56:58.437]  And then we've got Gerald Cilente coming on, but I've got other news here on the economy.
[00:56:58.437 --> 00:57:02.400]  We're going to be covering with them when they're on with us.
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:03.321]  But here's another headline.
[00:57:03.321 --> 00:57:06.283]  Infowars.com receives Rise of the Right script.
[00:57:06.283 --> 00:57:20.114]  For those that are interested about the Chris Matthews hit piece airing next Wednesday, and yes, I am the chief enemy and target along with Rand Paul, someone inside MSNBC who's concerned about the production and who does believe it's a hit piece who will remain anonymous,
[00:57:21.155 --> 00:57:22.637]  Has sent us the script.
[00:57:22.637 --> 00:57:26.381]  So this boffin has sent us the Death Star plans.
[00:57:26.381 --> 00:57:28.384]  And we do have it.
[00:57:28.384 --> 00:57:31.668]  And Paul Watson is writing a detailed article.
[00:57:31.668 --> 00:57:33.190]  But it's exactly what I predicted.
[00:57:34.841 --> 00:57:35.721]  They lied to me.
[00:57:35.721 --> 00:57:36.361]  Of course they lied.
[00:57:36.361 --> 00:57:37.261]  And I said, I know you're lying.
[00:57:37.261 --> 00:57:39.922]  They called and they said, oh, it's a friendly piece to understand the Tea Party.
[00:57:39.922 --> 00:57:40.962]  We want to be friends with you.
[00:57:40.962 --> 00:57:49.844]  And I said, no, you're going to show me next to Father Coughlin, the Nazi from the 40s, and you're going to show malicious shooting machine guns.
[00:57:49.844 --> 00:57:52.284]  And they said, no, no, no, we're doing something different.
[00:57:52.284 --> 00:57:53.504]  I said, no, you're not.
[00:57:53.504 --> 00:57:54.504]  And I have the script.
[00:57:54.504 --> 00:58:02.046]  It is exactly, of course, the standard Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL, but even more.
[00:58:02.046 --> 00:58:03.506]  Anyone who owns a gun is a Nazi.
[00:58:04.767 --> 00:58:06.208]  And is basically Hitler.
[00:58:06.208 --> 00:58:13.094]  They say this is Nazi Germany, and that Nazi Germany's about to happen, and that Hitler thought bankers were robbing people.
[00:58:13.094 --> 00:58:14.675]  No one's talking about Hitler.
[00:58:14.675 --> 00:58:16.336]  No one's discussing Hitler.
[00:58:16.336 --> 00:58:18.598]  The banks are robbing people.
[00:58:18.598 --> 00:58:22.061]  And MSNBC makes it all about Jews.
[00:58:22.061 --> 00:58:23.142]  We don't talk about Jews.
[00:58:23.142 --> 00:58:25.023]  We're not injecting Jews here.
[00:58:25.023 --> 00:58:26.504]  But Chris Matthews does.
[00:58:26.504 --> 00:58:28.646]  Exactly what I knew they would do.
[00:58:28.646 --> 00:58:29.287]  Exactly.
[00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:32.032]  Precisely.
[00:58:32.032 --> 00:58:33.553]  Because we know these people.
[00:58:33.553 --> 00:58:35.035]  They are pathetic.
[00:58:35.035 --> 00:58:36.817]  But we have the enemy script.
[00:58:36.817 --> 00:58:38.238]  We have the enemy script.
[00:58:38.238 --> 00:58:42.002]  We have the enemy script.
[00:58:42.002 --> 00:58:45.406]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.406 --> 00:58:47.428]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.663 --> 00:58:53.667]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:58:53.667 --> 00:58:59.014]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:58:59.014 --> 00:59:01.057]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:59:01.057 --> 00:59:06.063]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:59:06.063 --> 00:59:07.245]  How much do you want?
[00:59:07.245 --> 00:59:07.986]  When do you want it?
[00:59:08.346 --> 00:59:10.228]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:59:10.228 --> 00:59:11.309]  When will you need it?
[00:59:11.309 --> 00:59:13.512]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:59:13.512 --> 00:59:14.853]  Will there be any food?
[00:59:14.853 --> 00:59:16.375]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:59:16.375 --> 00:59:21.660]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:25.244]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:59:25.244 --> 00:59:28.708]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:59:29.048 --> 00:59:30.268]  How much will you need?
[00:59:30.268 --> 00:59:31.169]  We don't know.
[00:59:31.169 --> 00:59:32.269]  How much do you want?
[00:59:32.269 --> 00:59:33.209]  All you can get.
[00:59:33.209 --> 00:59:34.309]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:37.350]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:59:37.350 --> 00:59:37.870]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:37.870 --> 00:59:39.550]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:39.550 --> 00:59:40.571]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:40.571 --> 00:59:41.771]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:41.771 --> 00:59:43.591]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.222 --> 01:00:10.044]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.044 --> 01:00:11.644]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.644 --> 01:00:13.184]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.184 --> 01:00:17.366]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.366 --> 01:00:21.687]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.687 --> 01:00:27.269]  All right, it's already hour number two.
[01:00:27.269 --> 01:00:33.671]  Coming up after the break, we're going to start simulcasting the last three hours of the radio transmission, of the last two hours.
[01:00:35.264 --> 01:00:41.529]  52 Minutes, if you want to be technical, of this live Wednesday, the ninth day of June 2010.
[01:00:41.529 --> 01:00:46.453]  Edition at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:00:46.453 --> 01:00:47.573]  There is some good news.
[01:00:47.573 --> 01:00:52.317]  Cops must get warrant if DUI suspect balks at blood test.
[01:00:52.317 --> 01:00:55.639]  This is an Arizona court has ruled that, Arizona Supreme Court.
[01:00:55.639 --> 01:00:59.722]  Texas courts ruled the same thing, and the police just say, we don't care, we're still going to do it.
[01:00:59.722 --> 01:01:00.943]  It's a federal grant.
[01:01:00.943 --> 01:01:02.985]  We don't listen to a stinking state court.
[01:01:04.366 --> 01:01:07.190]  We hail Caesar!
[01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:14.520]  Exactly what happened in Rome 2,040 plus years ago.
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:17.984]  They have hailed Caesar, who's crossed the Rubicon.
[01:01:17.984 --> 01:01:20.127]  The federal government is Caesar.
[01:01:21.527 --> 01:01:27.929]  They have federal programs teaching 50 plus thousand preachers how to covertly brainwash their flocks to render unto Caesar and submit to the government.
[01:01:27.929 --> 01:01:30.090]  How is that a free society?
[01:01:30.090 --> 01:01:33.431]  How are TV ads all over the country to spy on your neighbor?
[01:01:33.431 --> 01:01:35.231]  How is that land of the free, home of the brave?
[01:01:35.231 --> 01:01:37.612]  The answer is, it isn't.
[01:01:37.612 --> 01:01:42.694]  The government can't stop the oil spill, but they can sure train the cops to hate the American people.
[01:01:42.694 --> 01:01:47.155]  The good news is a lot of police are waking up.
[01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:57.337]  Of course, it turns out the whole Hattari militia thing is fake and the judge says it's a cover-up and a fraud, that we're going to be going over that.
[01:01:58.997 --> 01:02:03.860]  I also mentioned InfoWars.com has received the Rise of the Right MSNBC hit piece.
[01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:06.182]  I don't get why we're obsessing over this so much, though.
[01:02:06.182 --> 01:02:09.404]  I mean, MSNBC, their average show has about 100,000 viewers.
[01:02:09.404 --> 01:02:11.445]  Their top show is half a million.
[01:02:11.445 --> 01:02:14.147]  This radio show has more viewers and listeners than they do.
[01:02:14.147 --> 01:02:15.428]  They're pathetic!
[01:02:15.428 --> 01:02:16.469]  They're pathetic!
[01:02:16.469 --> 01:02:24.114]  But it's all slick and glossy, and there's still that racial memory of TV being a big deal.
[01:02:25.512 --> 01:02:26.433]  It's a joke!
[01:02:26.433 --> 01:02:28.934]  Yeah, Glenn Beck's got 3 million viewers.
[01:02:28.934 --> 01:02:30.095]  That's pretty big.
[01:02:30.095 --> 01:02:34.618]  But I mean, somebody like Rush Limbaugh has over 10 million a day that tune in.
[01:02:34.618 --> 01:02:35.659]  22 million a week.
[01:02:35.659 --> 01:02:37.740]  George Norrie's got about 7 million tune in a day.
[01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:39.782]  16 million a week.
[01:02:39.782 --> 01:02:41.122]  Or more.
[01:02:41.122 --> 01:02:49.728]  That's every week, not people that listen later to internet retransmissions or... It's gotta be well over 20 million for George Norrie.
[01:02:49.728 --> 01:02:52.410]  This show, conservatively, 2 million on AM and FM.
[01:02:52.410 --> 01:02:53.531]  A million on the internet.
[01:02:54.633 --> 01:03:06.012]  Let's see, we don't have, you know, maybe I should put in a big fancy set and wear a $1,000, $2,000 suit and act all pompous like Chris Matthews.
[01:03:06.012 --> 01:03:08.256]  It's all a hoax.
[01:03:10.799 --> 01:03:12.601]  But he is trying to demonize the Tea Party.
[01:03:12.601 --> 01:03:16.784]  They've already tried to demonize Ron Paul and Rand Paul and Michelle Bachman and all these other people.
[01:03:16.784 --> 01:03:21.389]  And so now they're going to try to use me to demonize the Tea Party, and that's not going to work.
[01:03:21.389 --> 01:03:22.470]  Oh look, he's radical.
[01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:23.470]  He says radical things.
[01:03:23.470 --> 01:03:24.692]  Oh, scary!
[01:03:24.692 --> 01:03:29.015]  And then I'll just get more viewers, more listeners, because they're discredited.
[01:03:29.836 --> 01:03:37.641]  No one, the vast majority of people, even watching MSNBC, do not trust or like Slimeball Matthews.
[01:03:37.641 --> 01:03:40.083]  I mean, would you buy a used car from Chris Matthews?
[01:03:40.083 --> 01:03:42.104]  Would you let your daughter date Chris Matthews?
[01:03:42.104 --> 01:03:45.407]  He comes off like a fruit box.
[01:03:45.407 --> 01:03:46.988]  I love that term.
[01:03:46.988 --> 01:03:57.475]  A self-conceited, arrogant, dumb, cloistered, foolish, twit-like fruit box.
[01:04:00.396 --> 01:04:08.265]  And so, I'm not worried about their hit piece, but by the way, I knew exactly what your piece would be, and their producers know I told them what it would be.
[01:04:08.265 --> 01:04:10.328]  And, this is like every other piece.
[01:04:10.328 --> 01:04:12.551]  It's like every other thing you do.
[01:04:12.551 --> 01:04:14.112]  Oh, look at the Nazis.
[01:04:14.112 --> 01:04:16.275]  Now we're gonna cut to Rand Paul and Alex Jones.
[01:04:17.356 --> 01:04:21.819]  Oh, look at the mom who has her 10-year-olds and 5-year-olds involved in the Tea Party.
[01:04:21.819 --> 01:04:23.280]  Now let's cut to a militia guy.
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:24.000]  Isn't he scary?
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.081]  He's got a gun.
[01:04:25.081 --> 01:04:35.067]  No, people see that militia guy and say, thank God somebody's got guns to counterbalance this degenerate, out-of-control criminal government.
[01:04:35.067 --> 01:04:42.751]  Those militias are looking a lot more like George Washington than the paramilitary government we've got.
[01:04:42.751 --> 01:04:45.033]  So, you fail again, New World Order.
[01:04:46.581 --> 01:04:50.182]  We're going to blitz through news in the next hour with our guest in the studio, everyone live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:04:50.182 --> 01:04:52.943]  If you're not a PrisonPlanet.tv member, it's 15 cents a day.
[01:04:52.943 --> 01:04:56.104]  See all my films, read my book, Paul Watson's book.
[01:04:56.104 --> 01:04:58.584]  Don't tread on me's up there, it's so much more.
[01:04:58.584 --> 01:05:00.105]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:05:00.105 --> 01:05:04.886]  The question is where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:05:05.086 --> 01:05:06.047]  What have we got?
[01:05:06.047 --> 01:05:08.488]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:05:08.488 --> 01:05:09.509]  A republic.
[01:05:09.509 --> 01:05:12.150]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:14.412]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:05:14.412 --> 01:05:16.433]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:05:16.433 --> 01:05:18.114]  So they think they own our land?
[01:05:18.114 --> 01:05:19.435]  They think they own our water?
[01:05:19.435 --> 01:05:20.055]  Children?
[01:05:20.055 --> 01:05:21.156]  Our education?
[01:05:21.156 --> 01:05:21.997]  Our money?
[01:05:21.997 --> 01:05:25.659]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:05:26.019 --> 01:05:31.007]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:05:31.007 --> 01:05:32.029]  We have the facts.
[01:05:32.029 --> 01:05:33.170]  We have the Constitution.
[01:05:33.170 --> 01:05:34.092]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:05:34.092 --> 01:05:34.973]  We have common law.
[01:05:34.973 --> 01:05:37.497]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05:37.497 --> 01:05:41.283]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:05:41.363 --> 01:05:46.326]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:05:46.326 --> 01:05:47.827]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:05:47.827 --> 01:05:48.908]  Don't tread on me.
[01:05:48.908 --> 01:05:55.772]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.

[01:07:03.908 --> 01:07:10.309]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:17.690]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:07:17.690 --> 01:07:22.571]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:07:31.235 --> 01:07:35.479]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:07:35.479 --> 01:07:42.246]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:07:42.246 --> 01:07:46.149]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:07:46.149 --> 01:07:47.210]  Call us at 1-800-5-5-5.
[01:07:48.291 --> 01:07:54.215]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:54.215 --> 01:07:56.957]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:22.001 --> 01:08:31.148]  Well, we got both the filmmakers here with us today, but one's going to be in studio, Brian Kraft, who I met a year or so ago when they were shooting the film.
[01:08:31.148 --> 01:08:36.492]  And these guys have got some big movie credits to their names.
[01:08:36.492 --> 01:08:41.195]  And the website is thefallofamerica.net.
[01:08:41.195 --> 01:08:45.339]  And if we're going to save America, we've got to realize it's already fallen to the hands of the globalists.
[01:08:45.959 --> 01:08:46.299]  I don't know.
[01:09:07.336 --> 01:09:09.057]  Obviously in it, but I've watched it.
[01:09:09.057 --> 01:09:13.100]  I mean you talk about the master PhD and what's going on?
[01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:21.627]  This is the film and it's in sections so somebody can watch an hour or two a night and a week and a half It's like a miniseries.
[01:09:21.627 --> 01:09:22.547]  They will have it all down
[01:09:23.368 --> 01:09:29.871]  How to protect you and your family, your loved ones from financial armageddon, government tyranny, and the destruction of the middle class, and the end of freedom.
[01:09:29.871 --> 01:09:32.612]  This came out a year ago, but it's even more pertinent today.
[01:09:32.612 --> 01:09:37.354]  And coming up, we're going to play the trailer of the fall of America and the Western world.
[01:09:37.354 --> 01:09:40.115]  We're also simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:09:40.115 --> 01:09:41.816]  Gerald Salente is joining us in the next hour.
[01:09:42.296 --> 01:09:48.598]  Uh, for 30 minutes into the hour after that, so for an hour and a half, to write down all the big, uh, world events, and to take your phone calls.
[01:09:48.598 --> 01:10:01.383]  Uh, but, uh, Brian Kraft, why don't you, I know you don't like to brag about yourself, but, uh, uh, and, and, and Mr. Petula, you know, some of the big, uh, movies you guys have been involved, uh, uh, producing, and why you decided to make a documentary?
[01:10:01.383 --> 01:10:10.486]  Well, Alex, uh, we're, our, our other partner who's not here is Robert DiNasi, who you met as well, and he produced the film Flight Plan with, uh, Jodie Foster that was out in the theaters.
[01:10:11.041 --> 01:10:16.665]  Jimmy's produced a movie called Reversal, which was a father and son wrestling story.
[01:10:16.665 --> 01:10:19.447]  And I produced a bunch of documentaries.
[01:10:19.447 --> 01:10:23.710]  Actually, Alex, this film was actually an accident.
[01:10:23.710 --> 01:10:36.580]  When we set out to do this three years ago with our own money, totally independently financed, we were just going to make a movie about what it would be like to live in America in a post-9-11 world.
[01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:37.761]  Sort of an 80-minute thing.
[01:10:38.627 --> 01:10:50.033]  Um, so what we did was we started traveling the country and we met a bunch of notable economists, writers, journalists, filmmakers, politicians, bureaucrats, and we started interviewing them.
[01:10:50.033 --> 01:10:53.716]  We started talking to them about what it would be like to live in a post-911 America.
[01:10:55.442 --> 01:11:02.630]  And one word kept coming up and one phrase kept coming up over and over again in our transcripts as we're interviewing people.
[01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:04.252]  The word collapse.
[01:11:04.252 --> 01:11:12.201]  And I would hear things like from eminent people, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, the father of Reaganomics, Doug Casey, an eminent economist.
[01:11:12.201 --> 01:11:14.644]  You realize America's falling, Brian.
[01:11:14.644 --> 01:11:15.485]  We're already in.
[01:11:16.326 --> 01:11:23.171]  Yeah, mathematically, with fractional reserve banking, it's designed to do this, and it's like a heroin addict.
[01:11:23.171 --> 01:11:25.373]  You're going to end up dying from it if you stay on it.
[01:11:25.373 --> 01:11:29.036]  And we're now to the point of in a coma.
[01:11:29.036 --> 01:11:29.997]  Exactly.
[01:11:29.997 --> 01:11:31.298]  But I was surprised.
[01:11:31.298 --> 01:11:37.482]  So the film became the film about the collapse, the fall of Western civilization, because that's what you got.
[01:11:37.482 --> 01:11:41.526]  You were trying to make another film, but all these eminent people were telling you, no, this is what's going on.
[01:11:41.526 --> 01:11:41.826]  Correct.
[01:11:41.826 --> 01:11:45.589]  We were trying to make an 80-minute film, and we looked at each other halfway through this and said,
[01:11:46.468 --> 01:11:58.435]  We have a 10-hour series, home study course, survival guide in video form, DVD form, about the fall of America, which is not coming.
[01:11:58.435 --> 01:12:01.197]  This is what was made clear to me by these eminent people.
[01:12:01.197 --> 01:12:04.419]  It's not coming tomorrow, next year, or two years.
[01:12:04.419 --> 01:12:06.020]  We're in it now.
[01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:13.905]  And one of the eminent guests that I was talking to, Doug Casey, said, you know, in 1929, in the Great Depression, people thought it was over.
[01:12:15.148 --> 01:12:16.069]  They thought it was over.
[01:12:16.069 --> 01:12:18.312]  That's where we are in 2010 today.
[01:12:18.312 --> 01:12:24.098]  Inning 2, he said, of a 9-inning catastrophe, to use a baseball analogy.
[01:12:24.098 --> 01:12:27.121]  So, if we're in inning 2, I said, well, what's inning 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 gonna look like?
[01:12:29.161 --> 01:12:34.164]  And he said, the quality of life in America is going to decrease significantly.
[01:12:59.701 --> 01:13:07.048]  When comp troller David Walker says it's 25 times bigger than what we thought, meaning the recession in 08.
[01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:15.455]  When Paul Volcker says, hold on to your hats, this is really... These are the bureaucrats, in part, that started this, right?
[01:13:15.455 --> 01:13:17.957]  As part of the Keynes... But now they're gonna be our saviors.
[01:13:17.957 --> 01:13:18.737]  Right.
[01:13:18.737 --> 01:13:25.742]  So, when they're saying that, when Alan Greenspan is agreeing with Alex Jones, we've got a problem.
[01:13:25.742 --> 01:13:32.646]  When Alan Greenspan is agreeing with Doug Casey and Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and David Icke, it's time for the people to listen.
[01:13:32.646 --> 01:13:37.370]  And so the point of this film, really, is to help people protect themselves.
[01:13:38.010 --> 01:13:39.251]  That's why I'm here.
[01:13:39.251 --> 01:13:53.261]  And I want to go around the country and talk to schools and churches and rabbis and people in power or who have, you know, who have access to the community to tell people, guys, we're not in recovery.
[01:13:53.261 --> 01:13:56.043]  This is not, we're not in a good place right now.
[01:13:56.043 --> 01:14:00.026]  We're entering into the greater, greater depression.
[01:14:01.007 --> 01:14:02.048]  And that's why I'm here.
[01:14:20.748 --> 01:14:49.509]  uh... you know uh... headline here on the wall street journal investment banker it's going to get nasty by land barbed wire and guns and then here's the wall street journal that was msnbc tax hikes and the twenty twelve economic collapse look they knew this was going to happen because they designed it i mean we were saying this ten years ago we knew derivatives were thousands of times all the real money in the world and we're building towards that uh... you know towards being hundreds of thousands of times potentially and that if we don't say no
[01:14:50.169 --> 01:14:54.534]  To the people that got rid of the Glass-Steagall Act in 99, that's when we really knew this was going to happen.
[01:14:54.534 --> 01:14:56.056]  It was a surety.
[01:14:56.056 --> 01:15:00.441]  I had many economists on in 99-2000 that said in the next decade this will happen.
[01:15:00.441 --> 01:15:04.986]  And so now we're here, and the very crooks that engineered this are now posing as our saviors.
[01:15:04.986 --> 01:15:10.292]  If we don't expose them, they're going to get away with the next phase, and this is going to be a hundred inning depression.
[01:15:10.592 --> 01:15:16.836]  Because it's designed to be where they bankrupt us by design to make us be controlled by their system.
[01:15:16.836 --> 01:15:21.018]  And that's why the film, The Fall of America, is so important.
[01:15:21.018 --> 01:15:27.322]  You need to go to thefallofamerica.net, folks, and get this film and show it to everyone you know.
[01:15:27.322 --> 01:15:31.304]  Show it at your church, you know, over four or five weeks.
[01:15:31.304 --> 01:15:35.747]  Show it at the local library, whatever, so people understand what's happening.
[01:15:35.747 --> 01:15:37.288]  And I want to say one thing, Alex.
[01:15:37.888 --> 01:15:40.269]  Absolutely, it's about exposing them.
[01:15:40.269 --> 01:15:45.092]  But also, it's about protecting ourselves while we expose them.
[01:15:45.092 --> 01:15:50.295]  The analogy, another analogy I like is the ship is sinking, but none of us have prepared our lifeboats.
[01:15:50.295 --> 01:15:52.336]  If you've prepared your lifeboats, good for you.
[01:15:52.336 --> 01:15:54.077]  But there's literally 150 things in this 10-part series.
[01:15:56.938 --> 01:16:03.261]  That people need to do now, so that when this happens, the greater depression, we are okay.
[01:16:03.261 --> 01:16:06.203]  Because we need... Or what Salenti calls it, the greatest depression.
[01:16:06.203 --> 01:16:07.464]  The greatest depression.
[01:16:07.464 --> 01:16:08.404]  You've got to do things.
[01:16:08.404 --> 01:16:11.246]  It's not just financial things, but that's a big part of this.
[01:16:11.246 --> 01:16:14.167]  It's not just gold and silver, but that's a big part of it.
[01:16:14.167 --> 01:16:15.288]  It's a lot of other things as well.
[01:16:15.288 --> 01:16:17.529]  It's getting to know your neighbors, it's everything.
[01:16:17.529 --> 01:16:24.733]  Listen, I was out in Wimberley a month ago for a birthday party, and my son was going to somebody else's birthday party, and it was a campout.
[01:16:25.373 --> 01:16:28.374]  Off somebody's property there on a river by their house.
[01:16:28.374 --> 01:16:29.734]  And it was doctors and lawyers.
[01:16:29.734 --> 01:16:31.655]  It was well-to-do people.
[01:16:31.655 --> 01:16:33.315]  And I said, why are you all here in Wimberley?
[01:16:33.315 --> 01:16:37.177]  Oh, because we figured out five, ten years ago there was going to be a total world government collapse.
[01:16:37.177 --> 01:16:38.997]  And most of them didn't even know who I was.
[01:16:38.997 --> 01:16:39.877]  Some did.
[01:16:39.877 --> 01:16:45.279]  They had already separately figured all of this out.
[01:16:45.279 --> 01:16:46.699]  And the thing is, it's incredible.
[01:16:46.699 --> 01:16:51.341]  I've talked to people that are well-known American billionaire and others who left years ago.
[01:16:51.881 --> 01:16:53.342]  And they knew this was all coming.
[01:16:53.342 --> 01:16:57.226]  So this is common sense because the elite is engineering it.
[01:16:57.226 --> 01:17:00.789]  And so any of the intelligent people out there who have actually researched know it's coming.
[01:17:00.789 --> 01:17:13.520]  The reason I say identifying the enemy is the biggest solution, along with all these other solutions that are in the film, is because if they maintain their power and use this crisis to expand their power and use the implosion to bring in their police state,
[01:17:14.221 --> 01:17:15.322]  We have no hope.
[01:17:15.322 --> 01:17:20.326]  So as Ron Paul has said, we've got to use the crisis they've created to bring them out of power.
[01:17:20.326 --> 01:17:20.986]  That's right.
[01:17:20.986 --> 01:17:24.129]  We have a window, and it's not a long window.
[01:17:24.129 --> 01:17:25.530]  There's no delaying this.
[01:17:25.530 --> 01:17:27.972]  This isn't 2002 anymore.
[01:17:27.972 --> 01:17:30.413]  This is 2010, and this is happening.
[01:17:30.413 --> 01:17:37.659]  And there's literally 150 things you need to be doing right now to do, like you say, two things, protecting you and your family,
[01:17:38.482 --> 01:17:41.263]  And at the same time, exposing these people.
[01:17:41.263 --> 01:17:46.085]  Because when these guys fall, when we implode, we're gonna need to rebuild this thing.
[01:17:46.085 --> 01:17:46.345]  Right?
[01:17:46.345 --> 01:17:48.805]  And we're gonna need the best and the brightest to do so.
[01:17:48.805 --> 01:17:50.446]  So you're not doing anyone any good by pretending
[01:17:53.687 --> 01:17:58.611]  That this illusion, this Keynesian economic model is just gonna go on forever.
[01:17:58.611 --> 01:18:00.092]  It's not, like you said.
[01:18:00.092 --> 01:18:01.173]  It will fail.
[01:18:01.173 --> 01:18:04.816]  Unfortunately, it's gonna fail in our lifetimes and probably in the next few years.
[01:18:04.816 --> 01:18:07.979]  And the more they prop it up, when it does fail, the worse it's gonna be.
[01:18:07.979 --> 01:18:08.880]  That's right.
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:10.000]  That's exactly right.
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.863]  Printing more money and borrowing more money is not
[01:18:13.403 --> 01:18:15.585]  Is not the solution to this problem.
[01:18:15.585 --> 01:18:21.290]  Unless you're the mega banking class that creates the fiat currency and wealth, who gets total power out of it.
[01:18:21.290 --> 01:18:21.750]  Absolutely.
[01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:33.020]  It's great for them, at the end of the day, we're all poppers, everything's fried, we're now a third world nation, but they are in full control with a huge paramilitary police force to dominate us.
[01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:34.141]  And that's the game plan.
[01:18:34.141 --> 01:18:34.902]  I mean, this is it.
[01:18:34.902 --> 01:18:38.725]  And world government is about this being a planetary takeover.
[01:18:39.065 --> 01:18:41.627]  I mean, they openly say that in their own writings.
[01:18:41.627 --> 01:18:46.450]  And that's why it's so important people get The Fall of America and The Western World.
[01:18:46.450 --> 01:18:48.131]  And again, people can go to the website.
[01:18:48.131 --> 01:18:49.772]  What are some other ways they can order it?
[01:18:49.772 --> 01:18:51.713]  They can also order it by calling 1-800-655-1577.
[01:18:51.713 --> 01:18:51.913]  That's 1-800-655-1577.
[01:19:02.012 --> 01:19:04.473]  Uh, go to the website or call that number and they can order.
[01:19:04.473 --> 01:19:06.834]  It really is, this is the time to do it.
[01:19:06.834 --> 01:19:08.195]  You know, this is the time to do it, right?
[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:27.062]  And that's why your documentary is so important because it has all, I mean, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, myself, Naomi Wolf.
[01:19:27.062 --> 01:19:28.223]  In fact, it's a huge list.
[01:19:28.223 --> 01:19:32.324]  Go over some of the people when we come back that are in this documentary.
[01:19:32.324 --> 01:19:35.045]  Again, folks, it's thefallofamerica.net.
[01:19:35.045 --> 01:19:36.646]  Give them the number one more time.
[01:19:36.646 --> 01:19:36.866]  It's 1-800-655-1577.
[01:19:42.128 --> 01:19:42.648]  One more time.
[01:19:42.648 --> 01:19:43.089]  1-800-655-1577.
[01:19:43.089 --> 01:19:52.494]  It's just every time I have a guest on, we're promoting something to get the word out, I get calls later, what's that number?
[01:19:52.494 --> 01:19:57.117]  And then I'm looking around for it, because a lot of people are driving down the road, almost running off the road to get that number.
[01:19:57.117 --> 01:20:00.759]  We'll be right back with the filmmaker who's our guest in studio.
[01:20:00.759 --> 01:20:01.460]  You worry.
[01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:03.841]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[01:20:03.841 --> 01:20:04.361]  Hi.
[01:20:04.361 --> 01:20:06.803]  Summer's coming, and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[01:20:07.210 --> 01:20:11.673]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[01:20:11.673 --> 01:20:14.135]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[01:20:14.135 --> 01:20:17.497]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[01:20:17.497 --> 01:20:19.418]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[01:20:19.418 --> 01:20:22.220]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:25.942]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[01:20:25.942 --> 01:20:30.345]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[01:20:30.345 --> 01:20:34.448]  And her wild cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[01:20:34.448 --> 01:20:37.150]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator
[01:20:40.753 --> 01:20:43.115]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[01:20:43.115 --> 01:20:45.237]  She's my mom, and I watched her do it.
[01:20:45.237 --> 01:20:49.881]  So go to offthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.

[01:20:53.524 --> 01:20:54.485]  I think a storm's coming.
[01:21:01.553 --> 01:21:05.555]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[01:22:00.174 --> 01:22:10.198]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[01:22:10.198 --> 01:22:16.640]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:25.483]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[01:22:25.863 --> 01:22:35.046]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[01:22:35.046 --> 01:22:40.048]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[01:22:40.048 --> 01:22:41.448]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:41.448 --> 01:22:43.949]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.

[01:23:00.086 --> 01:23:03.607]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:23:03.607 --> 01:23:05.908]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:23:05.908 --> 01:23:06.768]  Don't!
[01:23:06.768 --> 01:23:10.209]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.

[01:23:33.878 --> 01:23:35.079]  Herb K. was right.

[01:23:38.281 --> 01:23:39.702]  What have you got to lose?

[01:23:55.094 --> 01:23:55.134]  800-822-1291
[01:24:04.673 --> 01:24:12.594]  Before our guest leaves us, we're going to get his take on how the mainstream media is demonizing anyone that talks about our country collapsing into world government.
[01:24:12.594 --> 01:24:18.535]  They're admitting world government in all the news, but then saying, you're a crazy Nazi, or you don't want government health care?
[01:24:18.535 --> 01:24:19.356]  You're a racist.
[01:24:19.356 --> 01:24:21.276]  I mean, it's like, you don't like a ham sandwich?
[01:24:21.276 --> 01:24:21.956]  You're a racist.
[01:24:21.956 --> 01:24:24.216]  I mean, you don't like cold weather?
[01:24:24.216 --> 01:24:24.997]  You're a racist.
[01:24:24.997 --> 01:24:26.657]  What does that have to do with it?
[01:24:26.657 --> 01:24:32.358]  They are desperate to inject division because they're scared if the American people ever get together,
[01:24:32.958 --> 01:24:45.304]  Black, white, old, young, German, Chinese, Jewish, Eskimo, Native American, whatever, against corrupt global corporations that are engaged in a global corporate takeover, none of us have a future!
[01:24:45.304 --> 01:25:01.133]  And Watson's got the article up now, MSNBC hit piece smears Tea Party as Neo-Nazis, and we got from someone inside Chris Matthews' operation, just gonna leave it at that, who is very concerned about this demonization, just like I got the machete script,
[01:25:01.653 --> 01:25:05.314]  from folks and Hispanic members of Rodriguez's staff sent me that.
[01:25:05.314 --> 01:25:07.675]  And Rodriguez later said, I guess this could cause race war.
[01:25:07.675 --> 01:25:09.476]  I guess I'm going to have to edit this.
[01:25:09.476 --> 01:25:10.716]  And I wasn't telling him to edit it.
[01:25:10.716 --> 01:25:14.137]  I was just saying this, this, this will probably cause some violence.
[01:25:14.137 --> 01:25:18.298]  I've never, it's like a Hispanic version of birth of a nation or something, but worse.
[01:25:18.298 --> 01:25:22.660]  I mean, it was just for those that haven't been to film school, you can go watch birth of a nation if you want.
[01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:25.181]  The point is, understand what I'm talking about.
[01:25:25.181 --> 01:25:26.541]  This is all happening.
[01:25:26.781 --> 01:25:27.961]  Right now.
[01:25:27.961 --> 01:25:31.022]  And MSNBC hit piece smears Tea Party as Neo-Nazis.
[01:25:31.022 --> 01:25:32.403]  That's coming up.
[01:25:32.403 --> 01:25:32.743]  No.
[01:25:32.743 --> 01:25:36.083]  We're talking about what's happening to our country and warning people.
[01:25:36.083 --> 01:25:37.364]  That's why we're so popular.
[01:25:37.364 --> 01:25:40.485]  That's why the mainstream media is upset doing these demonization pieces.
[01:25:40.485 --> 01:25:46.106]  And I look at this mini-series, The Fall of America and the Western World, a survival guide.
[01:25:46.106 --> 01:25:51.628]  It's an 8-disc DVD box set and it comes with a survival guide book.
[01:25:53.328 --> 01:25:54.829]  Inside of it.
[01:25:54.829 --> 01:25:58.852]  And also, I just want to plug this, because I hope people get it.
[01:25:58.852 --> 01:26:03.034]  For a limited time, there's a ninth disc they're offering with it.
[01:26:03.034 --> 01:26:10.059]  So I guess that comes out to about six and a half dollars per disc when you get the whole 10 plus hours.
[01:26:10.059 --> 01:26:10.799]  Again, that's amazing.
[01:26:10.799 --> 01:26:14.702]  Tell folks, some of the people that are in the fall of America and the Western world.
[01:26:14.702 --> 01:26:15.302]  Absolutely.
[01:26:15.302 --> 01:26:19.685]  This is important because what's, I think, another thing that's interesting about this phenomena
[01:26:20.365 --> 01:26:24.287]  Is that we have people who are from both sides of the political aisle.
[01:26:24.287 --> 01:26:33.031]  People who actually don't agree on anything, are agreeing on one thing, and that is America is in inning two of its collapse.
[01:26:33.031 --> 01:26:37.474]  And these are people who are anarchists, radicals, libertarians.
[01:26:37.474 --> 01:26:40.375]  But if you don't like how Obama's doing the oil spill, you must be racist.
[01:26:40.375 --> 01:26:43.657]  Or if you don't like peppermints, you must be racist.
[01:26:43.657 --> 01:26:45.178]  If you don't like my shirt, you're a racist.
[01:26:46.218 --> 01:26:47.218]  See, what does that have to do with it, though?
[01:26:47.218 --> 01:26:49.499]  They just inject that... To distract us.
[01:26:49.499 --> 01:26:50.679]  Yeah, it's a distraction.
[01:26:50.679 --> 01:26:51.500]  Distract us.
[01:26:51.500 --> 01:27:03.463]  I never thought I would see the day when an anarchist, libertarian, multi-millionaire is agreeing with David Icke, who's agreeing with Alan Greenspan, who's agreeing with Naomi Wolf, a liberal.
[01:27:03.463 --> 01:27:08.264]  All these people are agreeing that America is collapsing, and you better do something about it.
[01:27:08.264 --> 01:27:09.765]  So, let me answer your question.
[01:27:09.765 --> 01:27:10.825]  Who's in the film?
[01:27:10.825 --> 01:27:13.486]  We've got Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, the father of Reaganomics.
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:17.482]  Naomi Wolf, which is a, she's a, I think she was on your show.
[01:27:17.482 --> 01:27:17.882]  Yeah.
[01:27:17.882 --> 01:27:19.663]  New York Times best-selling author.
[01:27:19.663 --> 01:27:21.063]  You're in it, Alex Jones.
[01:27:21.063 --> 01:27:22.984]  She's one of the top feminists.
[01:27:22.984 --> 01:27:26.987]  Professor Mark Crispin Miller, who's head of media studies at NYU.
[01:27:26.987 --> 01:27:31.529]  Mickey Z, who's the author of the Ted Deadly, Ten Deadly Spins.
[01:27:31.529 --> 01:27:37.092]  G. Edward Griffins in the, this box series, this box set.
[01:27:37.092 --> 01:27:41.334]  Constitutionalist and journalist Joseph Farah is in it.
[01:27:42.077 --> 01:27:45.939]  Um, noted economist Doug Casey is in it.
[01:27:45.939 --> 01:27:48.760]  Uh, biblical scholar Ken Kline is in it.
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:50.661]  David Icke.
[01:27:50.661 --> 01:27:55.064]  Um, KABC radio talk, Doug McIntyre is in it.
[01:27:55.064 --> 01:27:59.346]  Um, a top economist David McIlvaney is in it.
[01:27:59.346 --> 01:28:03.068]  And also David Black provides some of the survival guide material.
[01:28:03.068 --> 01:28:05.289]  He's an expert on martial law.
[01:28:05.289 --> 01:28:11.372]  And he provides a special exclusive, uh, How to Survive Martial Law booklet with the film, Alex.
[01:28:12.199 --> 01:28:13.960]  Well, and of course, yours truly is in it.
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:15.962]  And you, Alex Jones.
[01:28:15.962 --> 01:28:21.205]  I tell you, it is just an amazing piece of work watching, and it just covers it all.
[01:28:21.205 --> 01:28:31.192]  The Fall of America and Western World, a survival guide, eight disc set with a free extra disc on top of it, and a bunch of booklets on martial law, you name it.
[01:28:31.192 --> 01:28:34.434]  I mean, it is just completely jam-packed here.
[01:28:34.434 --> 01:28:35.594]  It's important stuff.
[01:28:35.594 --> 01:28:39.317]  I really want to travel the country and just spread the word.
[01:28:39.838 --> 01:28:41.099]  You know, and just spread the word.
[01:28:41.099 --> 01:28:42.400]  I want to talk to churches.
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:45.382]  I want to talk to synagogues, to schools.
[01:28:45.382 --> 01:28:51.026]  We've got people you have... How do people contact you if they want to have you come speak to their group, Brian?
[01:28:51.026 --> 01:28:52.807]  You can contact me through their website.
[01:28:52.807 --> 01:28:55.089]  And that's thefallofamerica.net.
[01:28:55.089 --> 01:28:57.511]  The, one word, thefallofamerica.net.
[01:28:57.511 --> 01:28:58.291]  That's correct.
[01:28:58.291 --> 01:28:58.732]  That's correct.
[01:28:58.732 --> 01:29:04.176]  You can also contact me at Kid, K-I-D, Crafty, K-R-A-F-T-Y,
[01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:16.366]  I remember one of the things, Alex, that you told me when we interviewed you here in Austin.
[01:29:16.366 --> 01:29:18.228]  This was going on almost three years ago.
[01:29:18.228 --> 01:29:22.574]  That's how long it took us to create this mammoth box set.
[01:29:23.996 --> 01:29:34.523]  You said think of America as just a metaphor but think of America as a mansion and they've ripped out the marble and they've ripped out the wood carvings and the stairs.
[01:29:34.523 --> 01:29:36.344]  They've ripped out our mansion.
[01:29:36.344 --> 01:29:41.128]  So I'm now envisioning America and the Western world because this is not just America.
[01:29:41.128 --> 01:29:41.728]  It's Greece.
[01:29:41.728 --> 01:29:42.308]  It's Spain.
[01:29:42.308 --> 01:29:43.049]  It's Ireland.
[01:29:43.049 --> 01:29:44.450]  But let's talk about America.
[01:29:44.930 --> 01:29:47.294]  This mansion has 12 pillars.
[01:29:47.294 --> 01:29:48.696]  Two of them in 2000... Stay there!
[01:29:48.696 --> 01:29:49.136]  Stay there!
[01:29:49.136 --> 01:29:49.857]  We're gonna come back.
[01:29:49.857 --> 01:29:50.839]  We're gonna come back.
[01:29:50.839 --> 01:29:52.241]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.241 --> 01:29:54.764]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.764 --> 01:29:57.448]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.028 --> 01:30:05.991]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:05.991 --> 01:30:14.858]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:30:14.858 --> 01:30:19.482]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:30:19.482 --> 01:30:30.311]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:30:30.931 --> 01:30:40.433]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:40.433 --> 01:30:45.855]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.

[01:30:59.872 --> 01:31:04.436]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:04.436 --> 01:31:05.337]  Number 1.
[01:31:05.337 --> 01:31:08.759]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:08.759 --> 01:31:09.640]  Number 2.
[01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:14.524]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:14.524 --> 01:31:15.265]  It's true.
[01:31:15.265 --> 01:31:20.149]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:20.149 --> 01:31:20.970]  Number 3.
[01:31:20.970 --> 01:31:24.553]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:24.553 --> 01:31:28.236]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:28.456 --> 01:31:29.236]  Number 4.
[01:31:29.236 --> 01:31:31.997]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:31.997 --> 01:31:35.677]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:35.677 --> 01:31:36.477]  Number 5.
[01:31:36.477 --> 01:31:40.618]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:40.618 --> 01:31:45.679]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:45.679 --> 01:31:49.840]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:51.620]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:32:03.865 --> 01:32:05.145]  Tyranny is here.
[01:32:05.145 --> 01:32:08.807]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:32:08.807 --> 01:32:11.309]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:11.309 --> 01:32:17.172]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:32:17.172 --> 01:32:23.395]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:23.815 --> 01:32:29.777]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:32:29.777 --> 01:32:33.978]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:32:33.978 --> 01:32:38.259]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:32:38.259 --> 01:32:44.221]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:32:44.221 --> 01:32:47.782]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:32:47.782 --> 01:32:49.743]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:32:49.743 --> 01:32:50.183]  It's here.

[01:33:16.434 --> 01:33:19.556]  We as a nation are headed for an economic disaster.
[01:33:19.556 --> 01:33:29.021]  While our leaders and the mainstream media have finally admitted that the American economy is in critical condition, they are not telling us the whole truth.
[01:33:29.021 --> 01:33:36.106]  Four trillion dollars being spent here and there isn't that much money, you know, in the whole world available for the government.
[01:33:36.106 --> 01:33:37.927]  So they begin to recognize, why?
[01:33:38.727 --> 01:33:41.548]  My grandchildren are going to be paying this bill.
[01:33:41.548 --> 01:33:44.788]  My great-grandchildren may be paying this bill off.
[01:33:44.788 --> 01:33:49.289]  Are you financially and spiritually prepared to withstand the worst of times?

[01:34:25.056 --> 01:34:32.726]  Census takers are spreading out all over America, entering GPS coordinates of not only your house,
[01:34:33.683 --> 01:34:37.888]  But the front entrance, the back entrance, any side entrance is there.
[01:34:37.888 --> 01:34:44.434]  Any way they can, inch by inch, to take away the sovereign rights of the American people.
[01:34:44.434 --> 01:34:52.043]  The fall of America and the Western world is packed with hundreds of actionable tips that you can do right now to save yourself and your family.

[01:35:10.171 --> 01:35:15.836]  Uh, there's a longer trailer, and you can get an idea of what's in the film at thefallofamerica.net.
[01:35:15.836 --> 01:35:18.178]  And yes, I'm really promoting this because I'm in it.
[01:35:18.178 --> 01:35:19.319]  It's extremely informative.
[01:35:19.319 --> 01:35:20.700]  People need to see it.
[01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:24.444]  And the website is thefallofamerica.net to secure your copy.
[01:35:24.444 --> 01:35:31.030]  And even if you know all about this stuff, your friends, your family, your neighbors don't, it is vital to wake people up and to warn them.
[01:35:31.650 --> 01:35:31.930]  I don't
[01:35:47.116 --> 01:35:54.981]  Beautifully furnished, beautiful plants, beautiful rugs, beautiful chandeliers, fixtures, bookshelves.
[01:35:54.981 --> 01:36:00.224]  There was jewelry in the bedroom, in the jewelry box.
[01:36:00.224 --> 01:36:02.846]  There was a storehouse of knowledge.
[01:36:02.846 --> 01:36:06.528]  And now, everything is gutted.
[01:36:06.528 --> 01:36:07.488]  Please continue.
[01:36:07.488 --> 01:36:09.389]  Yeah, the mansion analogy.
[01:36:09.389 --> 01:36:12.151]  And I'll add one thing to that, Alex.
[01:36:12.151 --> 01:36:13.492]  The whole mansion is gutted.
[01:36:13.988 --> 01:36:20.834]  But out the back window of that mansion, you have Bernanke and people like him with bullhorns going, it's fine.
[01:36:20.834 --> 01:36:22.056]  We're in recovery.
[01:36:22.056 --> 01:36:23.036]  We're in recovery.
[01:36:23.036 --> 01:36:23.737]  Don't worry.
[01:36:23.737 --> 01:36:24.338]  See?
[01:36:24.338 --> 01:36:25.459]  There's more jobs now.
[01:36:25.459 --> 01:36:27.501]  They don't tell you that those are Census Bureau jobs.
[01:36:27.501 --> 01:36:32.025]  And the job is trying to change the pillars and actually wrecking the entire facility.
[01:36:32.385 --> 01:36:37.947]  They've got a wrecking ball, and they're like, don't worry, we've got the carbon tax.
[01:36:37.947 --> 01:36:43.789]  While you're destroying the actual superstructure, that'll give you a job.
[01:36:43.789 --> 01:36:46.990]  We'll give you a job putting your own neck in a noose.
[01:36:46.990 --> 01:36:47.990]  Exactly.
[01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:56.493]  So I imagined, as you were telling me this mansion analogy and explaining it to me, I imagined the mansion with 12 pillars.
[01:36:56.493 --> 01:37:00.554]  Well, I told this to Doug Casey, the eminent economist who's in the series,
[01:37:01.289 --> 01:37:08.419]  And he said, yeah, and two of those pillars have already fallen in 0-1, 0-8, and 0-9, right?
[01:37:08.419 --> 01:37:10.102]  And the other ten are already cracked.
[01:37:10.888 --> 01:37:14.049]  So this isn't, it's very important that we convey this.
[01:37:14.049 --> 01:37:19.911]  It's not about, oh, this could happen in 2012 or 13 or 14.
[01:37:19.911 --> 01:37:21.512]  No, it's happening now.
[01:37:21.512 --> 01:37:22.832]  We're in the middle of it.
[01:37:22.832 --> 01:37:24.893]  They've already annihilated our economy.
[01:37:24.893 --> 01:37:29.295]  NAFTA and GATT is, I mean, it's already falling apart and they keep lying, saying it's going to get better.
[01:37:29.295 --> 01:37:31.016]  It's going to get better in just a minute.
[01:37:31.016 --> 01:37:33.036]  It's going to, it's going to be all right.
[01:37:33.036 --> 01:37:33.436]  Yes.
[01:37:33.436 --> 01:37:39.879]  And so I really, I'm cautioning anybody who's listening and anyone who will listen to me and you,
[01:37:40.683 --> 01:37:44.209]  To please, yes, fight them.
[01:37:44.209 --> 01:37:47.275]  Yes, read Ron Paul's book, End of the Fed, and many others.
[01:37:47.275 --> 01:37:48.317]  You're a big Ron Paul fan.
[01:37:48.317 --> 01:37:48.898]  Love Ron.
[01:37:48.898 --> 01:37:50.521]  What woke you up, before you make that point?
[01:37:52.512 --> 01:37:58.236]  I think I've always had a problem with authority, and I always questioned... I just never felt right.
[01:37:58.236 --> 01:38:00.317]  I always felt like I was being lied to.
[01:38:00.317 --> 01:38:02.699]  And it became... No, you don't question government, sir.
[01:38:02.699 --> 01:38:04.140]  That's racist Al-Qaeda talk.
[01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:04.960]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:07.482]  Thomas Jefferson was a terrorist, and you may be with him.
[01:38:07.482 --> 01:38:09.623]  Thomas Jefferson is rolling in his grave.
[01:38:09.623 --> 01:38:13.726]  He's... whatever... everything that he warned against... He's Al-Qaeda, he's un-American.
[01:38:13.726 --> 01:38:14.026]  Right.
[01:38:14.026 --> 01:38:15.147]  George Washington's even worse.
[01:38:15.147 --> 01:38:15.908]  Come on.
[01:38:15.908 --> 01:38:16.908]  Come on, get with the program.
[01:38:16.908 --> 01:38:17.889]  Globalization's good.
[01:38:17.889 --> 01:38:19.910]  I'm sorry, the point you were trying to make when I interrupted you.
[01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:22.232]  You said, if I could just get one thing across to the people, so I interrupt.
[01:38:22.993 --> 01:38:33.393]  If I could just get one thing across to people is this we have to fight them Yes, you have to educate yourself and your family and your friends and the people that belong to your church and temples.
[01:38:33.393 --> 01:38:33.634]  Yes
[01:38:34.994 --> 01:38:38.796]  But you have to protect yourself as well.
[01:38:38.796 --> 01:38:55.724]  There are things you should be doing right now with regards to your finances, with regards to getting your home in order, to getting your block in order, with regards to knowing how to fight martial law, how to fix yourself spirit, not fix yourself, but how to get wise spiritually.
[01:38:55.724 --> 01:38:56.564]  Get your head screwed on.
[01:38:56.564 --> 01:38:57.705]  Get your head screwed on.
[01:38:57.705 --> 01:38:58.385]  There's things.
[01:38:58.385 --> 01:38:59.826]  And this movie, this series,
[01:39:00.846 --> 01:39:01.346]  In part.
[01:39:01.346 --> 01:39:02.587]  I'm not saying this is the fix-all.
[01:39:02.587 --> 01:39:04.448]  This is the beginning, right?
[01:39:04.448 --> 01:39:06.370]  Is, is, this series helps people.
[01:39:06.370 --> 01:39:07.150]  It's a road map.
[01:39:07.150 --> 01:39:07.911]  It's a road map.
[01:39:07.911 --> 01:39:10.132]  With, along with your work and Ron Paul's work.
[01:39:10.132 --> 01:39:23.961]  Oh no, I love, I love the fact that there's so many great films coming out and this one is truly different because it is in the long form and really gets into detail from all these different angles but that it creates a gestalt that, that, that all tells the same story.
[01:39:23.961 --> 01:39:25.762]  It tells the same story and, and frankly,
[01:39:26.576 --> 01:39:34.704]  When the economy collapses, or continues to collapse, and it gets worse, and there are breadlines and bank failures... Well, we already have 40 million people on food stamps.
[01:39:34.704 --> 01:39:36.065]  That's a 21st century breadline.
[01:39:36.065 --> 01:39:36.585]  Right, right.
[01:39:36.585 --> 01:39:38.187]  And more unemployment.
[01:39:38.187 --> 01:39:39.388]  And hyperinflation.
[01:39:39.388 --> 01:39:43.672]  And for anybody who doesn't know what that is, go Google hyperinflation Weimar Germany.
[01:39:43.993 --> 01:39:45.474]  Hyperinflation, Argentina.
[01:39:45.474 --> 01:39:47.356]  Hyperinflation, Zimbabwe.
[01:39:47.356 --> 01:39:54.263]  See, Americans think that we are impervious to... But the very same group of globalists have set this up here.
[01:39:54.263 --> 01:39:55.124]  Exactly.
[01:39:55.124 --> 01:39:59.948]  And it's happening in Greece, and Slovenia, and Spain... Iceland!
[01:39:59.948 --> 01:40:01.570]  Iceland, exactly.
[01:40:01.570 --> 01:40:03.912]  So, we're not impervious people.
[01:40:03.912 --> 01:40:05.874]  Iceland had months of almost no food on the shelves.
[01:40:07.728 --> 01:40:16.033]  And the bankers said you must give us basically everything, and when the people said no and rioted for a year, they found out that the bankers really didn't need all that money and it was all a big scam.
[01:40:16.033 --> 01:40:17.533]  But the question is, will we say no?
[01:40:17.533 --> 01:40:23.016]  And you know what's interesting, Alex, and this is what you have been doing so well for so many years, is this.
[01:40:23.016 --> 01:40:29.200]  When we collapse, and there are the breadlines and the bank failures, right?
[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:35.568]  Ask yourself, do you want to be the guy at home, or do you want to be the guy waiting in the bread line?
[01:40:35.568 --> 01:40:40.074]  Because if you prepare yourself now, you'll be the guy at home with your family, right?
[01:40:40.074 --> 01:40:41.055]  And other things.
[01:40:41.055 --> 01:40:43.659]  Now, what happens when this all collapses?
[01:40:44.571 --> 01:40:49.112]  That's when the Patriot Act and all these other draconian legislation... And what is the media saying?
[01:40:49.112 --> 01:40:57.635]  They're saying those of us that were warning and predicted this over a decade ago, like George Humphrey, the economist, who 12 years ago on my show predicted it all, and said by 2009, 2010, 11...
[01:41:00.836 --> 01:41:03.277]  Not just an economist, he's successful in private business.
[01:41:03.277 --> 01:41:05.577]  That's the real mark of somebody who knows what they're doing.
[01:41:05.577 --> 01:41:25.201]  And he said, look, this is designed to destroy us, they've done it in the third world, they're gonna do it here, and now we're here, we've been right, and instead of getting a gold star and saying, hey, these guys are great, let's listen to Ron Paul, let's listen to Alex Jones, no, Chris Matthews says in this new piece, I have the script, it's coming out next Wednesday, that we are basically Nazis, with no evidence!
[01:41:25.201 --> 01:41:27.161]  I mean, it's like, we're the enemy!
[01:41:27.161 --> 01:41:29.522]  We're the bad guys, we have to be dealt with now.
[01:41:30.442 --> 01:41:33.064]  Again, because they are the bad guys.
[01:41:33.064 --> 01:41:36.786]  Chris Matthews represents the real bad guys.
[01:41:36.786 --> 01:41:41.249]  And they know that if we have credibility, they're going to get defeated.
[01:41:41.249 --> 01:41:43.771]  So the bad guys are saying we're the terrorists.
[01:41:43.771 --> 01:41:54.798]  And in all their training, their Homeland Security Mike reports, it's us, the gun owners, the conservatives, the libertarians, the anti-war activists, anybody who is really for freedom and transparency.
[01:41:54.798 --> 01:41:57.140]  We are what Homeland Security is designed for.
[01:41:57.140 --> 01:41:59.562]  It's not for the people with turbines.
[01:41:59.562 --> 01:41:59.882]  Go ahead.
[01:42:00.442 --> 01:42:09.344]  It's just interesting to me that when we actually hear them say we're in a recovery, but what's funny is that they talk out of two sides of their mouth.
[01:42:09.344 --> 01:42:17.107]  Because when Alan Greenspan is saying we're hitting a credit tsunami, Alan Greenspan, this isn't Ron Paul, that's Alan Greenspan.
[01:42:17.107 --> 01:42:21.588]  When Comptroller David Walker is saying this is 25 times bigger than what we thought,
[01:42:22.321 --> 01:42:30.306]  And those people are agreeing with you, Alex Jones, who are agreeing with Ron Paul, who's agreeing with anarchists and radicals and leftists and socialists?
[01:42:31.021 --> 01:42:35.344]  People, please, it's time to pay attention, right now.
[01:42:35.344 --> 01:42:35.864]  Exactly.
[01:42:35.864 --> 01:42:40.567]  The problem is the bankers who engineered this, though, they're saying, oh, it's 25 times worse.
[01:42:40.567 --> 01:42:44.650]  According to the economists we've talked to, it's more like 500 times worse.
[01:42:44.650 --> 01:42:46.011]  And they know that.
[01:42:46.011 --> 01:42:55.377]  They knew when they created 1.5 quadrillion in derivatives, hundreds and hundreds, some cases thousands, more fake wealth than there is real assets on the planet.
[01:42:56.533 --> 01:43:05.161]  They knew that they got all the power on the way up, they could buy anybody, and on the way down, they still pose as the savior and enslave everyone.
[01:43:05.161 --> 01:43:07.023]  I mean, it is a life and death situation.
[01:43:07.023 --> 01:43:10.867]  Ron Paul and others who are great economists, and he's an economist as well, not just a medical doctor.
[01:43:10.867 --> 01:43:14.410]  He's been given doctorates for his research and papers on it from von Mies and others.
[01:43:16.257 --> 01:43:21.221]  They have put on record that there's a way to monetize the debt, but not have the bankers monetize it.
[01:43:21.221 --> 01:43:22.222]  There's a way to fix this.
[01:43:22.222 --> 01:43:23.383]  It's going to be painful.
[01:43:23.383 --> 01:43:25.184]  But we should have done it a decade ago.
[01:43:25.184 --> 01:43:28.087]  I mean, now we are wrecked any way you cut it.
[01:43:28.087 --> 01:43:32.330]  But if we let these people continue to pilot things, they're not going to give us any quarter.
[01:43:32.330 --> 01:43:32.771]  That's right.
[01:43:32.771 --> 01:43:34.032]  I mean, they're not going to stop.
[01:43:34.032 --> 01:43:41.438]  Listen, if Ron Paul got elected president, right, we went back on the gold standard and we ended the Fed tomorrow, we'd still be
[01:43:42.509 --> 01:43:44.009]  In a boatload of trouble.
[01:43:44.009 --> 01:43:45.790]  But that ain't gonna happen, I don't think.
[01:43:45.790 --> 01:43:46.750]  No, no.
[01:43:46.750 --> 01:43:49.351]  So we're in real, real trouble.
[01:43:49.351 --> 01:43:54.353]  And, you know, I'm right out there with you, fighting this, but I'm also gonna look out for myself.
[01:43:54.353 --> 01:43:56.353]  I'm also gonna prepare my family.
[01:43:56.353 --> 01:43:56.854]  Right?
[01:43:56.854 --> 01:44:01.095]  And so in this series, we have 150 tips that people can do.
[01:44:01.095 --> 01:44:01.595]  Right?
[01:44:01.595 --> 01:44:04.616]  We can, and we, and we, the, the, let me say this.
[01:44:04.616 --> 01:44:07.577]  The series is designed not just as a documentary.
[01:44:08.109 --> 01:44:14.192]  Not just as a survival guide, it's actually designed as a home study course.
[01:44:14.192 --> 01:44:29.800]  Throughout the movie, these title cards come up throughout the full 10 hours, and it tells you to do things, and write things down, and research things, and make phone calls, and gather your friends around, educating yourself and your family.
[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:30.520]  The time is now.
[01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:31.461]  We have to do it, Alex.
[01:44:32.452 --> 01:44:40.316]  Well, we do, and give folks the toll-free number one more time in case they didn't have that, and I'll give the listeners the website.
[01:44:40.316 --> 01:44:44.579]  It's thefallofamerica.net www.thefallofamerica.net.
[01:44:44.579 --> 01:44:48.100]  We've got links up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com as well.
[01:44:48.100 --> 01:44:49.001]  Give folks that number.
[01:44:49.001 --> 01:44:50.942]  The number to get the series is 1-800-655-1577.
[01:44:50.942 --> 01:44:51.182]  That's 1-800-655-1577.
[01:45:02.594 --> 01:45:03.655]  7-7.
[01:45:03.655 --> 01:45:13.161]  Now, Brian Kraft is our guest in studio right now, the filmmaker, along with Jimmy Pattula and others that made the Fall of America and the Western World Survival Guide.
[01:45:13.161 --> 01:45:17.304]  But I want to shift gears into something that, because I keep going back to the demonization.
[01:45:17.304 --> 01:45:25.350]  The good news is when they demonized Rand Paul in the last three weeks and lied about what he said and changed the transcript from Rachel Maddow,
[01:45:26.010 --> 01:45:30.592]  Where he had a three second delay and he was going, excuse me, excuse me, yes, yes, I can hear you.
[01:45:30.592 --> 01:45:31.133]  She's like, what?
[01:45:31.133 --> 01:45:32.353]  Yes, you're forgetting the Civil Rights Act?
[01:45:32.353 --> 01:45:34.014]  He says, no, I didn't say that.
[01:45:34.014 --> 01:45:34.454]  I can't hear.
[01:45:34.454 --> 01:45:36.255]  And then they changed the transcript.
[01:45:36.255 --> 01:45:37.676]  And that's only one of his issues.
[01:45:37.676 --> 01:45:38.676]  He doesn't even talk about it.
[01:45:38.676 --> 01:45:40.217]  It's not on his platform.
[01:45:40.217 --> 01:45:42.538]  He made clear he doesn't want to get rid of the Civil Rights Act.
[01:45:42.538 --> 01:45:48.141]  But it's another media hoax, just like they, you know, Howard Dean's not perfect, but he's better than Obama.
[01:45:48.841 --> 01:45:55.967]  Uh, and so they made a big deal out of his roar when there was a crowd screaming, but he had a cardio mic where you could only hear him, basically.
[01:45:55.967 --> 01:45:57.328]  And they made, you know, hype that.
[01:45:57.328 --> 01:46:01.612]  Oh, we can't have Howard Dean, who would have beaten Bush, but the cousin Kerry ran instead.
[01:46:01.612 --> 01:46:03.734]  And so, I mean, the point is, they rigged these things.
[01:46:03.734 --> 01:46:07.457]  This big hoax of, oh my gosh, Rand Paul can't win now.
[01:46:07.457 --> 01:46:12.901]  His poll numbers in every major poll went up after the three weeks of demonization.
[01:46:12.901 --> 01:46:14.983]  So, as a filmmaker, I want to play for you
[01:46:16.464 --> 01:46:28.576]  The trailer, the short trailer from The Rise of the New Right, a documentary that is being put out right now and it's airing next Wednesday.
[01:46:29.582 --> 01:46:31.683]  We have a message from the Tea Party.
[01:46:31.683 --> 01:46:34.644]  We've come to take our government back.
[01:46:34.644 --> 01:46:36.465]  There's a rising tide on the right.
[01:46:36.465 --> 01:46:38.565]  I think the government's too big.
[01:46:38.565 --> 01:46:41.887]  Voiced not just by extremists, but by recruits from the neighborhood.
[01:46:41.887 --> 01:46:44.007]  Our president is a liar.
[01:46:44.007 --> 01:46:46.088]  The Tea Party is determined to take power.
[01:46:46.088 --> 01:46:47.969]  What does that mean for America?
[01:46:47.969 --> 01:46:50.510]  We are in deep terror.
[01:46:50.510 --> 01:46:51.210]  Deep.
[01:46:51.210 --> 01:46:51.770]  Deep.
[01:46:51.770 --> 01:46:55.852]  I'm Chris Mathis with a hard look at the rise of the new right.
[01:46:55.852 --> 01:46:58.293]  Premieres June 16th at 7 on MSNBC.
[01:47:00.583 --> 01:47:06.545]  Now, we knew that this was going to be a hit piece early on.
[01:47:07.898 --> 01:47:16.343]  But I actually, last night, we got the script sent to us by somebody inside MSNBC that is concerned about it, and it's worse than I even thought.
[01:47:16.343 --> 01:47:18.624]  I mean, it is incredible.
[01:47:18.624 --> 01:47:24.347]  It implies, word for word, that I'm gonna make my listeners go out and murder everyone.
[01:47:24.347 --> 01:47:33.112]  It says that this is the same stuff Hitler said, and that we're basically the new Hitler, and that those of us that don't like what the banks are doing are Nazis, with no evidence.
[01:47:33.972 --> 01:47:35.896]  I mean, this is a desperation move.
[01:47:35.896 --> 01:47:37.038]  What's your take on it?
[01:47:37.038 --> 01:47:38.500]  It is a desperation move.
[01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:44.691]  Look, the people in power, the elite, they know exactly what they've done.
[01:47:44.691 --> 01:47:45.632]  It's planned.
[01:47:45.632 --> 01:47:47.616]  It's built into Keynesian economics.
[01:47:48.134 --> 01:47:50.636]  They always inevitably fail.
[01:47:50.636 --> 01:47:55.501]  They always inevitably collapse the system, and then move on to something else.
[01:47:55.501 --> 01:47:55.741]  Right?
[01:47:55.741 --> 01:48:00.966]  And prop it up again for 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 years, and then it collapses again.
[01:48:00.966 --> 01:48:01.786]  That's how it's built.
[01:48:01.786 --> 01:48:04.669]  Because the Ponzi scheme gives them an unfair trade advantage.
[01:48:04.669 --> 01:48:05.289]  That's right.
[01:48:05.289 --> 01:48:09.173]  So they've got to run a Ponzi scheme, but they don't go to jail like Madoff at the end.
[01:48:09.173 --> 01:48:10.174]  They become your dictator.
[01:48:10.174 --> 01:48:10.594]  Right.
[01:48:10.594 --> 01:48:13.277]  They spend the money before the inflation kicks in.
[01:48:13.937 --> 01:48:15.380]  Right?
[01:48:15.380 --> 01:48:16.923]  So of course they're doing that.
[01:48:16.923 --> 01:48:23.494]  They are in a... we're in a time right now where they are putting their... what would you say, Alex?
[01:48:23.494 --> 01:48:24.917]  They're putting their... the final...
[01:48:25.874 --> 01:48:47.472]  Yeah, they're bringing us into the controlled implosion, but the problem, and they say this in their own writings, is the world is awake and looking past Obama, past Bush, past Gordon Brown, past Angela Merkel, past Nicolas Sarkozy, past Rudd, to the power structure, and they are really concerned that they may have bitten off more than they can chew.
[01:48:47.472 --> 01:48:48.693]  That's right.
[01:48:48.693 --> 01:48:54.518]  Between that and knowing that this is supposed to implode, they're doing everything they can do right now.
[01:48:55.536 --> 01:49:01.961]  I mean, I think it's important that we quickly talk about what the world could look like when the economy crashes.
[01:49:01.961 --> 01:49:03.022]  Yeah, talk about that.
[01:49:03.022 --> 01:49:05.184]  Whether it's a year, two, three, or four years.
[01:49:15.371 --> 01:49:15.832]  Right?
[01:49:15.832 --> 01:49:18.634]  Well, what would we think would happen if there are bread lines?
[01:49:18.634 --> 01:49:23.457]  If the supermarket closes, and you have not listened to us today, right?
[01:49:23.457 --> 01:49:26.139]  And you don't have food for your family, right?
[01:49:26.139 --> 01:49:30.002]  And you don't listen to us today, and you don't have anything, and you're safe at home, right?
[01:49:30.002 --> 01:49:31.584]  And you can't get to your gold.
[01:49:31.584 --> 01:49:32.705]  And you don't have firearms.
[01:49:32.705 --> 01:49:34.106]  And you don't have firearms.
[01:49:34.106 --> 01:49:35.687]  And you're not off the grid.
[01:49:35.687 --> 01:49:39.650]  And you're completely reliant upon the system that has lied to you since birth.
[01:49:41.451 --> 01:49:43.232]  Of course you're going to be angry.
[01:49:43.232 --> 01:49:45.653]  Of course you're going to go out in the street to try and fend for yourself.
[01:49:45.653 --> 01:49:46.993]  And look at Haiti!
[01:49:46.993 --> 01:49:49.594]  They have 200,000 people die, thousands dying a week.
[01:49:49.594 --> 01:49:51.995]  You don't hear about them anymore.
[01:49:51.995 --> 01:49:52.756]  Exactly.
[01:49:52.756 --> 01:49:58.918]  So when that happens, when you have the bank failures and the supermarkets closing, and look, I want to say one thing.
[01:49:58.918 --> 01:50:00.019]  I hope I'm wrong.
[01:50:00.659 --> 01:50:02.520]  And I know I sound inflammatory.
[01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:06.001]  Well, regardless, we're already in a real depression, and the question is how severe.
[01:50:06.001 --> 01:50:06.481]  Right, right.
[01:50:06.481 --> 01:50:09.502]  And every evidence shows it's going to be the biggest ever.
[01:50:09.502 --> 01:50:10.322]  The biggest ever.
[01:50:10.322 --> 01:50:22.486]  I mean, when you've got people, again, when you've got noted multi-millionaire economists agreeing with Alan Greenspan and Warren Buffett, saying it's the greater or greatest depression, people, look out.
[01:50:23.146 --> 01:50:24.467]  Get to work right now.
[01:50:24.467 --> 01:50:25.608]  You still have time.
[01:50:25.608 --> 01:50:28.030]  We're not in the middle of this yet.
[01:50:28.030 --> 01:50:28.651]  Right?
[01:50:28.651 --> 01:50:31.433]  If this were 1929, you still have a few years.
[01:50:31.433 --> 01:50:33.735]  But you've got to start now, because this work takes time.
[01:50:33.735 --> 01:50:38.158]  Yeah, for two and a half years after 29, they were saying, it's fine, it's fixed.
[01:50:38.158 --> 01:50:46.365]  And then 33 is when they announced, here's your new president, War Powers Act, you know, turn your gold in, this is, you know, we're in a depression.
[01:50:46.365 --> 01:50:48.527]  And then that destroyed confidence even more.
[01:50:48.527 --> 01:50:49.868]  We'll be right back with our guest.
[01:50:49.868 --> 01:50:51.930]  Amazing information, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:52.190 --> 01:50:56.254]  The Fall of America and the Western World, 10-hour documentary film.
[01:50:56.254 --> 01:51:00.917]  Stay with us.
[01:51:00.917 --> 01:51:02.078]  Fatigue.
[01:51:02.078 --> 01:51:03.199]  Headaches.
[01:51:03.199 --> 01:51:04.521]  Allergies and asthma.
[01:51:04.521 --> 01:51:05.942]  Chronic disease.
[01:51:05.942 --> 01:51:07.803]  Is your home making you sick?
[01:51:07.803 --> 01:51:08.724]  Here's a fact.
[01:51:08.724 --> 01:51:16.731]  Our indoor air quality is getting worse, and the causes include chemicals, toxic gases, dust, pollen, dander, and even chemtrail particulates.
[01:51:16.731 --> 01:51:17.932]  To rid your home of these
[01:51:18.766 --> 01:51:19.007]  I think so.
[01:51:37.657 --> 01:51:38.077]  I think so.
[01:52:00.339 --> 01:52:01.640]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:07.246]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:07.246 --> 01:52:12.251]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:12.251 --> 01:52:17.836]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:17.836 --> 01:52:23.061]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:23.061 --> 01:52:24.943]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:52:25.362 --> 01:52:30.165]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:30.165 --> 01:52:31.265]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:31.265 --> 01:52:34.347]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:52:34.347 --> 01:52:37.969]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:37.969 --> 01:52:41.151]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:41.151 --> 01:52:43.372]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:43.372 --> 01:52:44.253]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:44.253 --> 01:52:44.473]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:44.473 --> 01:52:45.633]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[01:52:54.451 --> 01:52:57.021]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:57.021 --> 01:52:59.390]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:00.379 --> 01:53:03.381]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[01:53:03.381 --> 01:53:05.462]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[01:53:05.462 --> 01:53:08.203]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[01:53:08.203 --> 01:53:10.424]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[01:53:10.424 --> 01:53:11.845]  Okay, here it comes.

[01:53:13.746 --> 01:53:15.667]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[01:53:15.667 --> 01:53:17.668]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[01:53:17.668 --> 01:53:21.350]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[01:53:21.350 --> 01:53:29.095]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.

[01:54:12.858 --> 01:54:17.464]  Don't call my name out your window when I'm leaving
[01:54:19.490 --> 01:54:23.493]  Filmmaker Brian Kraft is with us until about five after in the next hour then.
[01:54:23.493 --> 01:54:27.997]  Top Trends forecaster Gerald Salente is going to be on with us via video Skype.
[01:54:27.997 --> 01:54:30.360]  That's a heads up for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:33.943]  If you're a member of PrisonPlanet.TV, I want to thank all the PrisonPlanet.TV members.
[01:54:33.943 --> 01:54:35.624]  You get all of my films in super high quality.
[01:54:35.624 --> 01:54:40.169]  My book, Paul Watson's book, many other films have been authorized to post like Camp FEMA.
[01:54:41.009 --> 01:54:49.171]  And, of course, the newest film, Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic, which is also full of Tenth Amendment, Ninth Amendment solutions.
[01:54:49.171 --> 01:54:51.152]  It's all available at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:54:51.152 --> 01:54:53.833]  I want to thank all the members.
[01:54:53.833 --> 01:54:54.233]  U.S.
[01:54:54.233 --> 01:54:57.173]  NORTHCOM gears up for potential attack on U.S.
[01:54:57.173 --> 01:54:58.354]  soil.
[01:54:58.354 --> 01:55:06.176]  They are really hyping that, oh, Homeland Brigade and the tens of thousands of regular Army that are deploying to take on American terrorists.
[01:55:06.696 --> 01:55:10.717]  We get their internal documents all about fighting gun owners, conservatives, landowners.
[01:55:10.717 --> 01:55:15.519]  They're saying, we're gearing up for attacks on American soil ahead of going into Iran.
[01:55:15.519 --> 01:55:22.381]  So they want to start World War III so you will accept the financial collapse because after all, our boys are dying in Iran.
[01:55:22.381 --> 01:55:29.303]  And even though we're in a bread line here and, you know, the carbon tax is coming in as part of the new austerity.
[01:55:29.303 --> 01:55:32.004]  Our grandparents had to do the same thing in the greatest generation.
[01:55:32.884 --> 01:55:40.854]  There's lots of money for government to be made with ration cards and all the insider trading and if you criticize it, well they just send thugs by to arrest you.
[01:55:40.854 --> 01:55:45.159]  Because criticizing the government during war is treason!
[01:55:45.159 --> 01:55:46.681]  The bankers gotta take all the money!
[01:55:46.681 --> 01:55:47.922]  We're fighting Al Qaeda's!
[01:55:49.059 --> 01:55:52.000]  Ben Laden's in Iran!
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:55.161]  CIA admits they're putting out fake videos, but that's okay.
[01:55:55.161 --> 01:56:05.805]  USNorthcom gears up for potential attack, and then a New York Times article, should this be the last generation, and it says Peter Singer, who's a top eugenicist, he says four of the earth.
[01:56:05.805 --> 01:56:07.486]  We shouldn't be allowed to have any children.
[01:56:08.266 --> 01:56:08.626]  That's right.
[01:56:32.173 --> 01:56:35.434]  It always has been forced coercion.
[01:56:35.434 --> 01:56:38.935]  And it's heating up and it's getting worse.
[01:56:38.935 --> 01:56:40.216]  And it's time.
[01:56:40.216 --> 01:56:43.257]  Well, most of your listeners, I hope, are doing something already.
[01:56:43.257 --> 01:56:49.399]  I just also hope that they're doing something to protect themselves as they fight this nonsense.
[01:56:49.399 --> 01:56:51.900]  Do you ever pinch yourself like it's surreal, though?
[01:56:51.900 --> 01:56:54.101]  Like you can't believe what's happening?
[01:56:54.101 --> 01:57:01.243]  I can't believe that we are the son and heirs of this global catastrophe that has all been orchestrated.
[01:57:02.268 --> 01:57:03.910]  I can't believe it's happening.
[01:57:03.910 --> 01:57:05.251]  You know, it's unfortunate.
[01:57:05.251 --> 01:57:07.373]  It really is, because I love this country.
[01:57:07.373 --> 01:57:11.817]  I want to say that this isn't a love letter to the fall of America and the Western world.
[01:57:11.817 --> 01:57:15.441]  This ten-part series is by no means a love letter.
[01:57:15.441 --> 01:57:17.723]  I'm saddened by this.
[01:57:17.723 --> 01:57:21.126]  You know, and it's horrible what they've done to us.
[01:57:21.126 --> 01:57:23.408]  And the globalists love it.
[01:57:23.408 --> 01:57:24.890]  The globalists love it.
[01:57:24.890 --> 01:57:26.891]  Because by wrecking things, they make us dependent.
[01:57:28.004 --> 01:57:30.365]  I mean, listen, all the freedoms, they're gone!
[01:57:30.365 --> 01:57:32.265]  I mean, this is now bondage, folks.
[01:57:32.265 --> 01:57:37.886]  This is police all over the country are charging people with felonies if you videotape them.
[01:57:37.886 --> 01:57:47.189]  Our country looks like, or not looks like, feels like an airport now, with people reporting to go here, and people go, report here, go here, stop here, do this.
[01:57:47.189 --> 01:57:50.870]  This is draconian legislation that we've allowed them to pass, right?
[01:57:50.870 --> 01:57:56.451]  They now admit they record your naked body, and the guards beat each other up because they make fun of each other's genitals.
[01:57:57.686 --> 01:58:02.211]  And movie stars come through now and they print off their naked body and women run up and say, please sign it.
[01:58:02.211 --> 01:58:04.073]  The government just says, that's the way it is.
[01:58:04.073 --> 01:58:06.856]  They're just letting you know, you are scum.
[01:58:06.856 --> 01:58:08.197]  You are trash.
[01:58:08.197 --> 01:58:09.298]  We dominate you.
[01:58:09.298 --> 01:58:11.561]  We are the scumbag government.
[01:58:11.561 --> 01:58:13.663]  Depend on us for everything.
[01:58:13.663 --> 01:58:15.125]  Depend on us for everything.
[01:58:15.125 --> 01:58:16.706]  For your food.
[01:58:16.706 --> 01:58:17.327]  For money.
[01:58:17.327 --> 01:58:18.168]  You need us.
[01:58:18.168 --> 01:58:18.829]  You need us.
[01:58:20.290 --> 01:58:22.631]  But no matter, we're going to crash your system.
[01:58:22.631 --> 01:58:24.531]  And then where are you going to be?
[01:58:24.531 --> 01:58:28.072]  Ask yourself, what's going to happen when this system crashes in a year or two?
[01:58:28.072 --> 01:58:29.492]  And it's already crashing!
[01:58:29.492 --> 01:58:37.154]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, you can check out more of the film by visiting the website, and that's thefallofamerica.net.
[01:58:37.154 --> 01:58:42.215]  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back in 70 seconds with our final segment with our guest.
[01:58:42.215 --> 01:58:43.576]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:43.576 --> 01:58:46.817]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.967 --> 01:58:53.968]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:58:53.968 --> 01:58:59.310]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:58:59.310 --> 01:59:01.351]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:59:01.351 --> 01:59:06.352]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:59:06.352 --> 01:59:07.533]  How much do you want?
[01:59:07.533 --> 01:59:08.273]  When do you want it?
[01:59:08.653 --> 01:59:10.535]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:59:10.535 --> 01:59:11.616]  When will you need it?
[01:59:11.616 --> 01:59:13.817]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:59:13.817 --> 01:59:15.159]  Will there be any food?
[01:59:15.159 --> 01:59:16.680]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:59:16.680 --> 01:59:21.944]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:59:21.944 --> 01:59:25.087]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:59:25.527 --> 01:59:29.350]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:59:29.350 --> 01:59:30.571]  How much will you need?
[01:59:30.571 --> 01:59:31.491]  We don't know.
[01:59:31.491 --> 01:59:32.592]  How much do you want?
[01:59:32.592 --> 01:59:33.513]  All you can get.
[01:59:33.513 --> 01:59:34.614]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:59:34.614 --> 01:59:37.656]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:59:37.656 --> 01:59:39.437]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:59:39.437 --> 01:59:40.358]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:53.487 --> 01:59:55.890]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.890 --> 02:00:05.504]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.504 --> 02:00:06.825]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.825 --> 02:00:07.807]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.579 --> 02:00:10.321]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.321 --> 02:00:11.923]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.923 --> 02:00:13.464]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.464 --> 02:00:17.668]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.668 --> 02:00:21.712]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:29.141 --> 02:00:37.027]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we've got five more minutes left with our guest, and for the next hour and a half, Gerald Cilente, the top Prince forecaster, will be our guest.
[02:00:37.027 --> 02:00:39.990]  Just all of his predictions continue to accelerate and come true.
[02:00:39.990 --> 02:00:48.617]  Brian Kraft, writer, director, producer of thefallofamerica.net, is in studio with us, and I just want to thank you for being with us today.
[02:00:48.617 --> 02:00:50.478]  In the time we've got left,
[02:00:52.242 --> 02:00:52.902]  It is sad.
[02:00:52.902 --> 02:00:56.064]  I mean, every day I get upset that I've been right about everything.
[02:00:56.064 --> 02:00:58.526]  I get upset that it's all worse than I thought.
[02:00:58.526 --> 02:01:06.090]  When Herman Van Rompuy, the head of the EU, comes out and says, we're going to have a global government, you're going to pay your carbon taxes to us, the very banks that engineered it, I get upset.
[02:01:06.090 --> 02:01:07.871]  I don't get, oh great!
[02:01:07.871 --> 02:01:19.258]  I mean, I already knew it, but to have them confirm it, it's like 14 years ago I was sent documents by a nurse in San Antonio, how the blood's taken and put in Pentagon databases for DNA databases and eugenics on all children.
[02:01:19.778 --> 02:01:22.922]  And then later I had Australian government parliament members on.
[02:01:22.922 --> 02:01:25.945]  I had a congressman on from Virginia in the last decade.
[02:01:25.945 --> 02:01:29.630]  I didn't get happy when the news came out and admitted it in the last year.
[02:01:29.630 --> 02:01:30.731]  Okay, we've got your blood.
[02:01:30.731 --> 02:01:32.253]  It goes to the Pentagon.
[02:01:32.253 --> 02:01:34.796]  I was watching a CNN clip last night where they were saying it was good.
[02:01:35.848 --> 02:01:38.009]  You know, I mean, it's sick!
[02:01:38.009 --> 02:01:41.709]  It's sick how, and it's sick how passive the public is.
[02:01:41.709 --> 02:01:47.531]  Folks, when you're passive, if you were passive with an employee who, they'd run all over you.
[02:01:47.531 --> 02:01:49.351]  If, you know, with a lot of bad employees.
[02:01:49.351 --> 02:01:57.473]  If you were passive with a neighbor, or, you know, what about a family you've had before, like a big brother who's a punk, who, I mean, if you just gave in to everything.
[02:01:57.473 --> 02:01:58.594]  Or a girlfriend or a boyfriend.
[02:01:58.594 --> 02:02:01.334]  If you're passive, they'll take advantage of you, let alone the U.S.
[02:02:01.334 --> 02:02:03.395]  government or any government.
[02:02:03.395 --> 02:02:04.135]  Any government.
[02:02:05.174 --> 02:02:08.917]  Run by global elites, who aren't patriots.
[02:02:08.917 --> 02:02:10.358]  That's what they've done, folks.
[02:02:10.358 --> 02:02:11.278]  That's what they have done.
[02:02:11.278 --> 02:02:14.861]  A bunch of Wall Street crooks are robbing us and we're surprised?
[02:02:14.861 --> 02:02:15.301]  Exactly.
[02:02:15.301 --> 02:02:24.748]  And they're telling us, we're gonna drug test you, we're gonna put you through naked body scanners, we're building prisons, we're gonna have checkpoints, we're gonna do all this, and that's just the way it is.
[02:02:24.748 --> 02:02:26.529]  Give us all your money.
[02:02:26.529 --> 02:02:29.211]  So protect yourself, now, as best you can.
[02:02:30.031 --> 02:02:30.491]  Do it now.
[02:02:30.491 --> 02:02:39.357]  Don't believe this nonsense that the recession is over, or that 2008 or 2009 was the worst it's going to get.
[02:02:39.357 --> 02:02:46.622]  It's going to get a whole lot worse, according, not to me, according to the experts and notables in our 10-part series.
[02:02:46.622 --> 02:02:49.144]  Well, I mean, it's great to see all your experts, and I'm one of them.
[02:02:49.684 --> 02:02:51.466]  I got the globalist documents.
[02:02:51.466 --> 02:02:53.027]  We know what they've done all over the third world.
[02:02:53.027 --> 02:02:54.929]  We have the Timberwolf documents.
[02:02:54.929 --> 02:03:09.484]  McClatchy has all the documents on how Goldman Sachs, who runs all the major regulatory agencies of the countries they're robbing, they're the key group, they're there on record saying we're going to sell everybody derivatives, then implode it, then get bailouts and destroy our competition.
[02:03:09.924 --> 02:03:12.645]  I mean, this is... they're on record!
[02:03:12.645 --> 02:03:13.966]  That's what Wall Street does.
[02:03:13.966 --> 02:03:16.147]  It goes into healthy companies and destroys them.
[02:03:16.147 --> 02:03:18.568]  It goes into healthy nations and destroys them.
[02:03:18.568 --> 02:03:19.768]  Breaks them up.
[02:03:19.768 --> 02:03:21.169]  This isn't free market.
[02:03:21.169 --> 02:03:22.830]  These are crooks!
[02:03:22.830 --> 02:03:24.911]  It's the opposite of free market.
[02:03:24.911 --> 02:03:26.251]  This is not free market.
[02:03:26.251 --> 02:03:29.713]  These people do not have your best interests at heart.
[02:03:29.713 --> 02:03:31.233]  Just the opposite.
[02:03:31.233 --> 02:03:34.575]  Everything they do is counterproductive to your security.
[02:03:34.575 --> 02:03:36.876]  And that's why you need to listen to shows like this
[02:03:37.426 --> 02:03:40.929]  And read the end of the Fed and buy the Fall of America and the Western World.
[02:03:40.929 --> 02:03:43.031]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[02:03:43.031 --> 02:03:47.215]  Brian Kraft, fire out that number for folks that aren't on the Internet or want to call and order that way.
[02:03:47.215 --> 02:03:51.599]  Sure, you can get the 10-part series, The Fall of America and the Western World, at 1-800-655-1577.
[02:03:51.599 --> 02:03:52.660]  That number again is 1-800-655-1577.
[02:04:03.331 --> 02:04:04.171]  We're good to go.
[02:04:24.252 --> 02:04:26.433]  We noticed your YouTube channel has 50 million views.
[02:04:26.433 --> 02:04:27.533]  That's just one of eight channels.
[02:04:27.533 --> 02:04:32.275]  We have over 200 million views just on YouTube channels I can go look at to post my stuff.
[02:04:32.275 --> 02:04:33.275]  200 million on YouTube.
[02:04:33.275 --> 02:04:35.956]  Folks, we're hurting them!
[02:04:35.956 --> 02:04:38.517]  And the destiny of these films are in your hands.
[02:04:38.517 --> 02:04:40.558]  Well, Mr. Kraft, I want to thank you for coming in.
[02:04:40.558 --> 02:04:47.500]  It's been awesome, and I want to commend Jimmy Patil and everybody else that worked on the film, The Fall of America and the Western World.
[02:04:47.500 --> 02:04:49.661]  The Survival Guide booklet comes with it as well.
[02:04:49.661 --> 02:04:51.402]  We'll talk to you again soon, hopefully in studio.
[02:04:51.402 --> 02:04:52.062]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:04:52.062 --> 02:04:52.342]  Pleasure.
[02:04:52.922 --> 02:04:53.503]  You bet.
[02:04:53.503 --> 02:04:57.109]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, straight ahead.
[02:04:57.109 --> 02:05:00.134]  Probably the most popular guest we have on, according to the numbers we see.
[02:05:01.550 --> 02:05:07.996]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[02:05:07.996 --> 02:05:13.260]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.

[02:06:59.730 --> 02:07:02.052]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:07:02.052 --> 02:07:04.433]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:07:04.433 --> 02:07:07.655]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:07:07.655 --> 02:07:12.759]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:07:12.759 --> 02:07:16.942]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:07:17.262 --> 02:07:19.726]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:07:19.726 --> 02:07:22.149]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:07:22.149 --> 02:07:25.414]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:07:25.414 --> 02:07:33.026]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:07:33.348 --> 02:07:38.731]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:07:38.731 --> 02:07:41.052]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:07:41.052 --> 02:07:45.274]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:07:45.274 --> 02:07:46.334]  And I got news for you.
[02:07:46.334 --> 02:07:47.675]  You're everyone else.
[02:07:47.675 --> 02:07:49.176]  Invisible Empire.

[02:08:01.972 --> 02:08:04.754]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.754 --> 02:08:07.555]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:15.373 --> 02:08:21.518]  Well, the Wall Street Journal is now reporting that they believe the United States will completely collapse by next year.
[02:08:21.518 --> 02:08:23.639]  We're going to be going over that headline.
[02:08:23.639 --> 02:08:29.924]  MSNBC has guest analysts on saying, buy guns, barbed wire, and farmland.
[02:08:29.924 --> 02:08:37.950]  More and more people are sounding just like Gerald Salente, who's been predicting exactly what's happening right now for at least the last six to seven years with precision.
[02:08:38.630 --> 02:08:38.890]  I think?
[02:08:57.450 --> 02:09:07.238]  MSNBC script for the Rise of the New Right special, they're going to be airing over and over again starting next Wednesday, hosted by Chris Matthews.
[02:09:07.238 --> 02:09:10.580]  They lied to me, but I knew they were lying.
[02:09:10.580 --> 02:09:15.724]  I told them, I said, this will be me cut into neo-Nazis and militias.
[02:09:16.565 --> 02:09:18.386]  And you will demonize Ron Paul and Rand Paul.
[02:09:18.386 --> 02:09:21.648]  And they said, no, no, we're just profiling you and it's all friendly.
[02:09:21.648 --> 02:09:23.469]  We want to know the Tea Party.
[02:09:23.469 --> 02:09:24.609]  Well, I have the script.
[02:09:24.609 --> 02:09:26.430]  None of what I said was in there.
[02:09:26.430 --> 02:09:27.891]  Basically, it's all distorted.
[02:09:27.891 --> 02:09:33.614]  Nothing about reaching out to the controlled left, explaining to them that, you know, the false left-right paradigm.
[02:09:33.614 --> 02:09:34.594]  None of it.
[02:09:34.594 --> 02:09:36.535]  It is worse than I thought.
[02:09:36.535 --> 02:09:39.096]  And the article is up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:09:39.096 --> 02:09:43.899]  MSNBC hit piece smears Tea Party as neo-Nazis.
[02:09:43.899 --> 02:09:45.760]  This is so important.
[02:09:46.500 --> 02:09:54.286]  And so we're going to get Gerald Salente's take on that, on the economy, on the Iran situation, the Israeli flotilla, all of it.
[02:09:54.286 --> 02:09:56.948]  Really, Gerald Salente needs no introduction.
[02:09:56.948 --> 02:10:04.114]  I can look at our PrisonPlanet.tv numbers, our web streaming numbers, just the phone calls we get, the YouTube channel.
[02:10:04.614 --> 02:10:04.834]  I don't
[02:10:26.281 --> 02:10:32.908]  And he really doesn't need any introduction, but he is the Trends Research Institute, founded in 1980.
[02:10:32.908 --> 02:10:35.651]  TrendsResearch.com has a long, illustrious bio.
[02:10:35.651 --> 02:10:43.559]  Find out more at TrendsResearch.com or in the past interviews we've done with him at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:10:43.559 --> 02:10:47.403]  Gerald, so much is happening, so much is unfolding.
[02:10:47.403 --> 02:10:48.304]  Good to have you here with us.
[02:10:49.202 --> 02:10:50.143]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:11:20.384 --> 02:11:34.445]  I've said this before, that in the mainstream media and a number of these talk show blowhards out there, they keep calling what's going on in America socialism, the ones that don't like Obama.
[02:11:35.031 --> 02:11:43.053]  We've made it very clear that the merger of state and corporate powers, by definition, is called fascism.
[02:11:43.053 --> 02:11:51.975]  So what we're seeing is first we're seeing the merger of state and corporate powers like never before, with the whole guise of the too-big-to-fails.
[02:11:51.975 --> 02:11:53.315]  And look at the facts.
[02:11:53.315 --> 02:12:02.137]  You go back to the early 1990s, the top banks, the top six banks, had about 15% of the action out there.
[02:12:04.418 --> 02:12:13.741]  Now, the top six banks control 65% of all the financial assets in the United States.
[02:12:13.741 --> 02:12:20.143]  So as we become more fascist, what you're seeing now is the squeezing of the little people.
[02:12:20.143 --> 02:12:24.524]  Oh, those dangerous Amish, you have to really watch out for them.
[02:12:24.524 --> 02:12:28.746]  You never know when their horse and buggies will be taking over another town.
[02:12:29.326 --> 02:12:31.589]  And it's squeezed the little people at every end.
[02:12:31.589 --> 02:12:38.777]  Look what they're doing to the small farmers, making it almost impossible for them to compete as they're becoming more popular.
[02:12:38.777 --> 02:12:40.499]  Look at the numbers.
[02:12:40.499 --> 02:12:42.862]  What is the IRS doing?
[02:12:42.862 --> 02:12:48.268]  They're cracking down on the little people as they're turning a blind eye to the big corporations.
[02:12:48.789 --> 02:13:07.101]  So that's what's going on, and as you pointed out, how the MSNBC did a snow job on you, they do it with everybody, in making the Tea Party look like as though it's a right-wing fanatical movement of right-wing nuts.
[02:13:07.101 --> 02:13:08.863]  And it's the same story.
[02:13:08.863 --> 02:13:10.484]  Let's go back over the history.
[02:13:11.084 --> 02:13:21.387]  In 2007, in the Trends Journal, our top trend for that year, while Bush was president, was that we were going to see the emergence of major tax revolts.
[02:13:21.387 --> 02:13:22.527]  What did they do?
[02:13:22.527 --> 02:13:23.848]  They ignored it!
[02:13:23.848 --> 02:13:31.530]  In 2009, the first Tea Parties in tow protests, tax protests, what did they do in the mainstream media?
[02:13:32.150 --> 02:13:33.451]  They ridiculed it.
[02:13:33.451 --> 02:13:35.454]  They said it was going nowhere.
[02:13:35.454 --> 02:13:42.461]  And then, as they could no longer turn a blind eye to it, and it started gaining momentum, what do they do next?
[02:13:42.461 --> 02:13:44.203]  They demonize it.
[02:13:44.203 --> 02:13:47.086]  So it's a very familiar pattern.
[02:13:47.086 --> 02:13:50.650]  We know where they're going, and they're not going to be able to stop it.
[02:13:50.650 --> 02:13:51.912]  It has a life of its own.
[02:13:53.356 --> 02:13:54.376]  Well, that's my next point.
[02:13:54.376 --> 02:14:01.720]  We see three weeks of a hoax saying that Rand Paul wants to get rid of the Civil Rights Act, which he never even talked about.
[02:14:01.720 --> 02:14:02.940]  It's not on his platform.
[02:14:02.940 --> 02:14:04.301]  He said, no, I don't.
[02:14:04.301 --> 02:14:07.002]  And they said, no, yes, you do.
[02:14:07.002 --> 02:14:09.803]  And his approval rating went up.
[02:14:09.803 --> 02:14:11.364]  In one poll was 16 percent.
[02:14:11.364 --> 02:14:12.845]  It went up to 20 percent.
[02:14:12.845 --> 02:14:14.365]  Another poll was 20 percent.
[02:14:14.365 --> 02:14:14.905]  It went up to 25 percent.
[02:14:16.485 --> 02:14:27.030]  He gained between three to six points in a whole index of polls after three weeks of 24-7 basically saying he was the second coming of Adolf Hitler.
[02:14:27.030 --> 02:14:29.031]  So what does that say to Chris Matthews and others?
[02:14:29.031 --> 02:14:30.892]  That's what I told Politico.
[02:14:30.892 --> 02:14:35.754]  I said, look, if you want to hurt Rand Paul, endorse him.
[02:14:35.754 --> 02:14:38.635]  You guys are shooting an empty gun.
[02:14:38.635 --> 02:14:44.238]  More and more, there's less and less people that believe a word that comes out of your stinking mouth.
[02:14:45.436 --> 02:14:52.198]  Of course, it's the same old Washington Beltway circle jerk.
[02:14:52.198 --> 02:14:53.038]  Turn them on!
[02:14:53.038 --> 02:15:01.720]  It's the same guys over and over and the same tired old faces saying the same old things.
[02:15:01.720 --> 02:15:06.461]  The only people that are listening to them are themselves.
[02:15:06.461 --> 02:15:09.522]  The whole nation is going in another direction.
[02:15:09.522 --> 02:15:12.043]  Again, we'll only stick with the facts.
[02:15:12.523 --> 02:15:14.744]  They ridiculed the Tea Party.
[02:15:14.744 --> 02:15:17.024]  They said it would go nowhere.
[02:15:17.024 --> 02:15:18.984]  The lefties hate them.
[02:15:18.984 --> 02:15:27.346]  They've turned them into, you know, again, a stereotype that does not encompass the full meaning of the movement.
[02:15:27.346 --> 02:15:34.008]  So just as they do, Alex, when there's a mass demonstration like the ones they just had in Greece.
[02:15:34.588 --> 02:15:37.150]  Or the ones they have in the U.S.
[02:15:37.150 --> 02:15:46.936]  They throw in the agents provocateurs to make it seem as though the whole thing is nothing but an anarchist movement.
[02:15:46.936 --> 02:15:50.998]  They're doing the same thing by demonizing the Tea Party.
[02:15:50.998 --> 02:16:00.684]  Sure, there are lunatics in there, unlike the respectable lunatics in the Democratic Party, like President Obama.
[02:16:01.304 --> 02:16:05.766]  Who has sent more troops into Afghanistan?
[02:16:05.766 --> 02:16:10.228]  Who has expanded the mass murder in Pakistan?
[02:16:10.228 --> 02:16:17.212]  Oh, well, they're respectable because, as you've heard me say, they're among the elites.
[02:16:17.212 --> 02:16:22.074]  The Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Bullets, Bombs and Banks group.
[02:16:22.074 --> 02:16:26.236]  They only do things with pinkies up in a dignified way.
[02:16:26.236 --> 02:16:28.357]  They kill you with drones.
[02:16:28.837 --> 02:16:30.058]  God forbid!
[02:16:30.058 --> 02:16:32.600]  They would never have an AK-47!
[02:16:32.600 --> 02:16:55.599]  So what they do is they make it seem as though the people of the movement are all out of their minds, they're all head to the hills with pork and beans and barricade yourself in because the end of the world is coming movement, rather than admitting to the depth and breadth of this movement.
[02:16:56.019 --> 02:17:05.868]  It's not going to be the Tea Party that really brings forth the change, but it's the first element of something very big.
[02:17:05.868 --> 02:17:08.650]  I've said this over and over again, and I'll say it again.
[02:17:08.650 --> 02:17:09.051]  That's right.
[02:17:09.051 --> 02:17:13.275]  It's the same sore to pop out to show us that the country is very sick.
[02:17:14.232 --> 02:17:19.415]  Yeah, again, it's the beginning of the Second American Revolution.
[02:17:19.415 --> 02:17:21.056]  It's underway.
[02:17:21.056 --> 02:17:28.981]  The Chris Matthews, the Obermans, the rest of them are not going to stop it.
[02:17:28.981 --> 02:17:30.182]  It's happening.
[02:17:30.182 --> 02:17:32.584]  They can ridicule it all they want.
[02:17:32.584 --> 02:17:38.207]  Again, it's the same Washington Beltway circle jerk.
[02:17:38.207 --> 02:17:42.710]  You know, I go into these websites, you know, the liberal ones, like Raw Story.
[02:17:43.050 --> 02:17:47.352]  Oh, they're so proud of calling themselves progressives.
[02:17:47.352 --> 02:17:57.316]  Progressives, every day in there they have what Jon Stewart said, what Stephen Colbert said, how about what Bozo the Clown said?
[02:17:57.316 --> 02:17:59.877]  They're clowns, that's it!
[02:17:59.877 --> 02:18:01.998]  And these are the ones they look up to.
[02:18:01.998 --> 02:18:09.882]  So the liberals look up to the clowns, the Colberts, and the Stewarts, and they make fun of the rest.
[02:18:11.778 --> 02:18:15.859]  It's incredible, and then the right wing thinks Sarah Palin's gonna save them, but that's not gonna happen.
[02:18:15.859 --> 02:18:27.083]  And the other good news is every incumbent, whether Republican or Democrat, whether it's Arlen, Specter, or Grayson, they are all being thrown out by the more extreme.
[02:18:27.083 --> 02:18:39.748]  The more extreme you are, according to mainstream media, because they're up on the hill, like Buddha, pronouncing what reality is, the more extreme you are, the more the mainstream media demonizes you, the faster you get put into office.
[02:18:41.087 --> 02:18:44.290]  You know, again, look at the people that just won the elections yesterday.
[02:18:44.290 --> 02:18:50.837]  Oh, you're real fireballs out there in California for governor and senator, you know.
[02:18:50.837 --> 02:18:53.400]  I mean, come on, look at these people.
[02:18:53.400 --> 02:18:56.043]  What did this woman Whitman spend, $80 million?
[02:18:57.574 --> 02:18:59.135]  Yeah, what are they?
[02:18:59.135 --> 02:19:00.415]  What do they do so great?
[02:19:00.415 --> 02:19:02.656]  What do they say that's so enlightening?
[02:19:02.656 --> 02:19:15.100]  You put somebody in office to run against them, like a Rand Paul, that brought the Tea Party to a whole level that was never admitted to before, they can't withstand it.
[02:19:15.100 --> 02:19:16.280]  So what do they do?
[02:19:16.280 --> 02:19:18.221]  They take the cheap shots.
[02:19:18.221 --> 02:19:21.902]  Look what just happened with this woman, Helen Thomas.
[02:19:21.902 --> 02:19:23.682]  We're 89 years old.
[02:19:23.682 --> 02:19:25.283]  Boy, do they beat her up!
[02:19:25.663 --> 02:19:28.745]  Boy, do they show how tough they are!
[02:19:28.745 --> 02:19:30.146]  And what did they do?
[02:19:30.146 --> 02:19:40.834]  They defused the whole atrocity that Israel committed by boarding the Turkish ships in international waters.
[02:19:40.834 --> 02:19:41.774]  Bam!
[02:19:41.774 --> 02:19:43.616]  Out of the news!
[02:19:43.616 --> 02:19:52.062]  And instead, they hung 89-year-old Helen Thomas up as someone to show, don't mess around with them!
[02:19:53.137 --> 02:19:53.897]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:19:53.897 --> 02:19:55.378]  We'll put out the pasture.
[02:19:55.378 --> 02:19:57.259]  Old cow can't even stand up.
[02:19:57.259 --> 02:19:58.639]  Daryl Salente, stay there.
[02:19:58.639 --> 02:20:03.101]  We're going to come back and talk about a host of issues.
[02:20:03.101 --> 02:20:04.321]  This is not a drill.
[02:20:04.321 --> 02:20:06.242]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[02:20:08.830 --> 02:20:09.731]  We're good to go.
[02:20:31.334 --> 02:20:32.475]  Any circumstance.
[02:20:32.475 --> 02:20:39.700]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[02:20:39.700 --> 02:20:40.420]  But listen up.
[02:20:40.420 --> 02:20:46.644]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[02:20:46.644 --> 02:20:48.486]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[02:20:48.486 --> 02:20:50.667]  That's hideyourguns.com.
[02:20:50.667 --> 02:20:51.167]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[02:20:51.167 --> 02:20:52.989]  Before they come for your guns.

[02:21:02.236 --> 02:21:08.685]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[02:21:08.685 --> 02:21:13.091]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.
[02:21:13.960 --> 02:21:28.283]  Featuring Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Joseph Farah, David Icke, Naomi Wolf, G. Edward Griffin, Doug McIntyre, Mark Crispin-Miller, Mickey Z, Doug Casey, David McElhaney, and myself, Alex Jones.
[02:21:28.283 --> 02:21:33.304]  Protect yourself and get the tools you need to protect your family from these difficult times.

[02:22:00.720 --> 02:22:10.742]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[02:22:10.742 --> 02:22:17.184]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[02:22:17.184 --> 02:22:26.026]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[02:22:26.426 --> 02:22:35.610]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[02:22:35.610 --> 02:22:40.211]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world-reserved currency.
[02:22:40.211 --> 02:22:42.012]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:42.012 --> 02:22:44.513]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.

[02:22:49.498 --> 02:22:49.898]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:49.898 --> 02:22:52.561]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[02:23:06.049 --> 02:23:06.509]  We're good to go!
[02:23:34.855 --> 02:23:35.635]  That's right.
[02:24:16.920 --> 02:24:23.601]  Gerald Cilente is our guest on the radio, also simulcasting on television at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:24:41.333 --> 02:24:44.137]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:24:44.137 --> 02:24:51.046]  You can also send questions to our Twitter account, twitter.com forward slash RealAlexJones.
[02:24:51.046 --> 02:24:53.769]  And I'll also bring up some of those questions later in this hour.
[02:24:53.769 --> 02:24:56.793]  But the first 30 minutes of the next hour, questions for Gerald Cilente.
[02:24:57.694 --> 02:25:00.417]  I want to get back into what's happening with North Korea.
[02:25:00.417 --> 02:25:03.401]  The media is saying, Ben Laden's now in Iran.
[02:25:03.401 --> 02:25:04.783]  He's like a chess piece they moved.
[02:25:04.783 --> 02:25:11.751]  I mean, they could move him, I guess, to the Amish property they're trying to take right now and say, you know, Ben Laden's in a Pennsylvania Amish community.
[02:25:11.751 --> 02:25:13.733]  We've got to drop nukes on them.
[02:25:14.494 --> 02:25:17.055]  I want to discuss that, what's happening in North Korea.
[02:25:17.055 --> 02:25:21.676]  But before we go any further, your trends forecast on the economy.
[02:25:21.676 --> 02:25:24.016]  Investment banker, it's going to get nasty.
[02:25:24.016 --> 02:25:25.596]  Buy land, barb wire.
[02:25:25.596 --> 02:25:27.257]  That's CNBC.
[02:25:27.257 --> 02:25:28.977]  Here's the Wall Street Journal headline.
[02:25:28.977 --> 02:25:32.538]  Tax hikes and the 2011 economic collapse.
[02:25:32.538 --> 02:25:35.499]  Today's corporate profits reflected income shift in 2010.
[02:25:35.499 --> 02:25:36.899]  These profits will tumble next year.
[02:25:37.699 --> 02:25:40.781]  Proceeded, most likely, by the stock market.
[02:25:40.781 --> 02:25:44.723]  And North comes in the news today, Gerald, saying, Al-Qaeda's gonna hit!
[02:25:44.723 --> 02:25:46.264]  We gotta put army on the streets!
[02:25:47.864 --> 02:25:51.966]  Yeah, well, it is collapsing, and there's nothing that they could do to stop it.
[02:25:51.966 --> 02:26:05.313]  We saw what's going on in Europe with the Greek tragedy, the trillion dollars that they just spent to help bail out Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and others.
[02:26:05.313 --> 02:26:12.557]  And then we heard Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany, say that this is only a temporary measure.
[02:26:12.557 --> 02:26:14.117]  It's not going to fix the problem.
[02:26:14.117 --> 02:26:14.958]  Of course it's not.
[02:26:17.339 --> 02:26:27.402]  Put on more debt on top of old debt to revive an economy and then plus putting austerity measures into place.
[02:26:27.402 --> 02:26:31.603]  So we're looking at the collapse of the crash of 2010.
[02:26:31.603 --> 02:26:34.264]  It's going to happen before the clock strikes 2011.
[02:26:34.264 --> 02:26:35.404]  Let's look at the facts, Alex.
[02:26:37.845 --> 02:26:43.167]  As you mentioned, we said that in 2010 the stimulus money would start to run out.
[02:26:43.167 --> 02:26:46.629]  Last week we saw the unemployment numbers come in.
[02:26:46.629 --> 02:26:49.030]  They expected 150,000 to 160,000 jobs to be created in the private sector.
[02:26:55.473 --> 02:26:57.254]  41,000 were created.
[02:26:57.254 --> 02:27:07.163]  Out of 95, 95% of all the jobs created in May were census workers.
[02:27:07.163 --> 02:27:11.687]  Temporary jobs... And to interrupt, Gerald, that's even using rigged numbers.
[02:27:11.687 --> 02:27:18.173]  We learn at least a half a million people are fired and hired each month in the census and then counted as new jobs.
[02:27:18.173 --> 02:27:21.015]  So even with cooked books, 95% are government.
[02:27:22.256 --> 02:27:22.717]  Right.
[02:27:22.717 --> 02:27:26.760]  And then they're going to be gone by the end of the summer.
[02:27:26.760 --> 02:27:28.061]  Then what?
[02:27:28.061 --> 02:27:31.724]  And I think what you're saying is what we're saying.
[02:27:31.724 --> 02:27:36.128]  And that is when all else fails, they lead you to war.
[02:27:37.469 --> 02:27:54.328]  And just as we're seeing the ineptitude of the government by dealing with this tragedy in the Gulf with the oil spill, just as we saw their Katrina-quality rescue skills, just as they keep fighting losing wars on drugs,
[02:27:55.009 --> 02:28:11.269]  Just as they fail to improve the education system with leaving no child left behind or any other scheme, just as they lose with health care reform, just as they lose with financial reform,
[02:28:12.335 --> 02:28:15.037]  The military are losers too.
[02:28:15.037 --> 02:28:28.568]  This week we lost, what, 17 US troops in Afghanistan in a losing war that's costing hundreds of billions, that's going to cost more lost lives
[02:28:29.068 --> 02:28:32.132]  And that's going to be a losing war at the end.
[02:28:32.132 --> 02:28:42.747]  So to divert our attention, Iran looks like the next war that they will start and lose so that they can't admit to their other failures.
[02:28:45.504 --> 02:28:53.209]  Gerald, the CIA, as you know, two weeks ago bragged to the Washington Post that they had put out fake Bin Laden videos.
[02:28:53.209 --> 02:28:54.190]  So that's now confirmed.
[02:28:54.190 --> 02:28:56.231]  We already knew that, but now it's admitted.
[02:28:56.231 --> 02:29:03.975]  Now they've got a known Israeli propaganda front saying that Bin Laden is in Iran.
[02:29:03.975 --> 02:29:11.480]  With no proof, they're just saying this right on time for World War III with Iran.
[02:29:12.540 --> 02:29:22.788]  Yes, and this whole Spring Trends Journal is the great war that the United States and our, quote, allies are leading us to.
[02:29:22.788 --> 02:29:30.114]  Look, a couple of weeks ago, we saw the German president resign.
[02:29:30.114 --> 02:29:31.535]  And why did he resign?
[02:29:32.538 --> 02:29:38.540]  He admitted why they're in Afghanistan, and they're going from baby step to goose step.
[02:29:38.540 --> 02:29:39.881]  All right, stay there, stay there.
[02:29:39.881 --> 02:29:45.763]  Let's come back with the Great War with Gerald Cilente, and he's saying he sees the total meltdown this year.
[02:29:45.763 --> 02:29:48.824]  So that's less than six months.
[02:29:48.824 --> 02:29:49.385]  Stay with us.
[02:29:49.385 --> 02:29:51.265]  This is vital info straight ahead.
[02:29:51.265 --> 02:29:52.646]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.646 --> 02:29:55.187]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.187 --> 02:29:57.848]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.520 --> 02:30:02.162]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:30:02.162 --> 02:30:05.545]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.
[02:30:05.545 --> 02:30:10.750]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.
[02:30:10.750 --> 02:30:14.193]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.
[02:30:14.193 --> 02:30:16.515]  Check them out on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[02:30:17.156 --> 02:30:20.699]  Or call 800-340-7091.
[02:30:20.699 --> 02:30:21.840]  Take my word for it.
[02:30:21.840 --> 02:30:24.483]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[02:30:24.483 --> 02:30:31.008]  Since 1947, Calvin's Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[02:30:31.008 --> 02:30:32.510]  Buy American and stay clean.
[02:30:32.510 --> 02:30:35.813]  As well as support InfoWars, visit 5starsoap.com today.
[02:30:35.813 --> 02:30:36.213]  Or call 1-800-340-7091.
[02:30:36.213 --> 02:30:37.554]  Well, Marty, what do you have to say?
[02:30:40.819 --> 02:30:48.748]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, satisfaction is guaranteed on W Dirtback.
[02:30:48.748 --> 02:30:53.874]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 for a free catalog or visit our website 5starsoap.com.
[02:30:53.874 --> 02:30:54.314]  Thank you!
[02:31:00.134 --> 02:31:05.117]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:31:05.117 --> 02:31:06.098]  What have we got?
[02:31:06.098 --> 02:31:08.559]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:31:08.559 --> 02:31:09.560]  A republic.
[02:31:09.560 --> 02:31:12.201]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:31:12.201 --> 02:31:14.483]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:31:14.483 --> 02:31:16.504]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:31:16.504 --> 02:31:18.185]  So they think they own our land?
[02:31:18.185 --> 02:31:19.506]  They think they own our water?
[02:31:19.506 --> 02:31:20.106]  Children?
[02:31:20.106 --> 02:31:21.227]  Our education?
[02:31:21.227 --> 02:31:22.048]  Our money?
[02:31:22.048 --> 02:31:25.710]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:31:26.070 --> 02:31:31.054]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:31:31.054 --> 02:31:32.075]  We have the facts.
[02:31:32.075 --> 02:31:33.236]  We have the Constitution.
[02:31:33.236 --> 02:31:34.136]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:31:34.136 --> 02:31:35.017]  We have common law.
[02:31:35.017 --> 02:31:37.539]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:31:37.539 --> 02:31:41.322]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:31:41.442 --> 02:31:46.388]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:31:46.388 --> 02:31:47.890]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:31:47.890 --> 02:31:48.971]  Don't tread on me.
[02:31:48.971 --> 02:31:55.859]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:31:59.884 --> 02:32:04.425]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:04.425 --> 02:32:05.346]  Number 1.
[02:32:05.346 --> 02:32:08.767]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:08.767 --> 02:32:09.627]  Number 2.
[02:32:09.627 --> 02:32:14.529]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:14.529 --> 02:32:15.269]  It's true.
[02:32:15.269 --> 02:32:20.130]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:20.130 --> 02:32:20.971]  Number 3.
[02:32:20.971 --> 02:32:24.552]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:24.552 --> 02:32:28.253]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:28.453 --> 02:32:29.253]  Number 4.
[02:32:29.253 --> 02:32:32.014]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:32.014 --> 02:32:35.694]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:35.694 --> 02:32:36.474]  Number 5.
[02:32:36.474 --> 02:32:40.615]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:40.615 --> 02:32:45.676]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:45.676 --> 02:32:49.857]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:49.857 --> 02:32:51.637]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:51.637 --> 02:32:56.238]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[02:32:56.578 --> 02:32:57.079]  This is the end
[02:33:09.600 --> 02:33:19.146]  By the way, in the last 30 minutes of the show today, I'm going to go through the Chris Matthews hit piece, because this is a new level in demonization and propaganda of Rand Paul, myself, and others.
[02:33:19.146 --> 02:33:21.827]  I may even have to go into overdrive at the end of the show.
[02:33:21.827 --> 02:33:32.974]  Just for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and InternetInfoWars.com listeners, because that information is so important, but we'll probably have time to cover it during regular broadcast time in the last 30 minutes after Gerald Cilente leaves us.
[02:33:32.974 --> 02:33:36.977]  Before we go back to Gerald Cilente and his incredibly valuable
[02:33:37.717 --> 02:33:40.559]  Crystal ball level analysis.
[02:33:40.559 --> 02:33:41.800]  We need your support.
[02:33:41.800 --> 02:33:45.762]  I know the economy is falling apart, and we're trying to expand here.
[02:33:45.762 --> 02:33:49.884]  We're getting millions and millions of visitors a week, millions of listeners a week just on the internet.
[02:33:49.884 --> 02:33:52.806]  I'm going to be quite honest with you, it's very costly bandwidth-wise.
[02:33:52.806 --> 02:34:00.411]  And my crew, the engineers, the webmasters, the writers, the news websites, the films I'm making, the radio show, we're self-funded.
[02:34:00.871 --> 02:34:07.679]  Through radio sponsorship and through the sales of books, videos and t-shirts and ball caps.
[02:34:07.679 --> 02:34:09.401]  Everything we do is about getting the word out.
[02:34:09.401 --> 02:34:13.065]  When you wear an Infowars.com shirt, you're advertising liberty and freedom.
[02:34:13.065 --> 02:34:17.270]  When you wear a Don't Tread On Me shirt, you're advertising liberty and freedom and you're supporting us.
[02:34:17.270 --> 02:34:19.672]  You know, buying a nine dollar t-shirt, we make like four bucks.
[02:34:20.733 --> 02:34:25.777]  When you buy a Don't Tread on Me film, you get a great documentary about states' rights and you support us.
[02:34:25.777 --> 02:34:31.662]  When you get Police State 4 The Rise of FEMA, you'll get a film that can wake people up about the police state takeover and how illegal it is.
[02:34:31.662 --> 02:34:37.106]  When you get a film like Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement, you'll understand the Bilderberg Group and what their master plan is.
[02:34:37.106 --> 02:34:42.309]  Same thing with Invisible Empire, Fall of the Republic, Camp FEMA, all available at InfoWars.com.
[02:34:44.571 --> 02:34:56.417]  Or you can see them all in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv and watch the live radio show, another added level, another dimension of information warfare against the globalists.
[02:34:56.417 --> 02:35:01.299]  So please order the videos because they wake people up and secondarily it also supports our operation.
[02:35:01.299 --> 02:35:03.820]  Infowars.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:35:11.773 --> 02:35:15.175]  Also, we've got InfoWarsShop.com.
[02:35:15.175 --> 02:35:18.716]  InfoWarsShop.com is a new shopping cart we just launched.
[02:35:18.716 --> 02:35:27.140]  We still have our Yahoo card, and we're going to be launching a couple other shopping carts in the future, so you have more choices of different ways to shop on different platforms.
[02:35:27.140 --> 02:35:28.281]  And we couldn't have done it without you!
[02:35:28.601 --> 02:35:35.284]  I mean, when I set out 15 years ago to do a radio show and a local TV show, I never intended to be as successful as I am.
[02:35:35.284 --> 02:35:40.786]  But it's the message of how successful other activists and other patriots can be that is so vital.
[02:35:40.786 --> 02:35:44.067]  So again, InfoWars.com or you can simply write to us.
[02:35:44.987 --> 02:35:45.387]  at P.O.
[02:35:45.387 --> 02:35:53.731]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760 and order the books, videos, and materials.
[02:35:53.731 --> 02:35:58.833]  And if you want to order by mail, you can also call the toll-free number and ask questions about different specials and combos.
[02:35:58.833 --> 02:36:04.135]  Some of the films are as low as $4.95 apiece, like Loose Change Final Cut.
[02:36:04.135 --> 02:36:07.757]  Okay, enough of me here ranting about the documentaries.
[02:36:07.757 --> 02:36:11.899]  Let's go back to Gerald Cilente, but speaking of solutions, you know, I
[02:36:12.399 --> 02:36:16.863]  I think Evergreen is the name of the game in really convincing people.
[02:36:16.863 --> 02:36:30.476]  When somebody sees a film I made like Road to Tyranny 8 years ago and everything in it came true, I found my older films are even more effective than my new ones sometimes because people can go, this guy, how did he know this 8 years ago?
[02:36:30.476 --> 02:36:32.498]  Or they can watch my first film made 13 years ago.
[02:36:33.158 --> 02:36:34.579]  America destroyed by design.
[02:36:34.579 --> 02:36:36.319]  And they say, how did this guy know this?
[02:36:36.319 --> 02:36:38.280]  It's the same thing with the Trends Journal.
[02:36:38.280 --> 02:36:47.024]  You know, it's great to get the latest Trends Journal, which is important to get on how they're trying to start a war and how they're going to totally implode the economy soon.
[02:36:47.024 --> 02:36:49.104]  But it's also good to get back journals.
[02:36:49.104 --> 02:37:00.129]  So tell folks how they get a subscription to the latest journal, but how do they get back journals so they can really get an understanding of how important your view of the world is, Gerald Solente.
[02:37:00.779 --> 02:37:07.045]  Well, our website, they could go to TrendsJournal.com and just request the back Trends Journals and we send them to you.
[02:37:07.045 --> 02:37:08.966]  It's as simple as that.
[02:37:08.966 --> 02:37:09.747]  Awesome.
[02:37:09.747 --> 02:37:16.013]  What are some key journals from the past that you would recommend for people to order?
[02:37:16.013 --> 02:37:19.015]  Well, you know, one of them in 2004, I came out and said that in 2007,
[02:37:24.656 --> 02:37:27.878]  We would enter, quote, the Great Recession.
[02:37:27.878 --> 02:37:30.079]  So we saw it back then.
[02:37:30.079 --> 02:37:42.465]  And we also saw back in 2001, we knew that gold prices would go to record highs, and we call the bottom at $275 an ounce.
[02:37:42.465 --> 02:37:44.386]  It's very simple to see.
[02:37:44.386 --> 02:37:50.649]  And that was by knowing that they would begin to lower interest rates to 46-year lows.
[02:37:52.130 --> 02:37:59.192]  So you can't keep printing this digital money, not worth the paper, it's not printed on, without ruining the economy.
[02:37:59.192 --> 02:38:02.672]  And the other ones, of course, we forecast terrorism.
[02:38:02.672 --> 02:38:13.815]  Back in my book, Trends 2000, back in 1997, you could see these trends coming, but people are, they want to live in denial, Alex, but not anymore.
[02:38:14.435 --> 02:38:17.979]  More and more people want the truth, they want the facts.
[02:38:17.979 --> 02:38:23.544]  The motto, by the way, of the Trends Research Institute is, think for yourself.
[02:38:23.544 --> 02:38:26.848]  I don't tell people what to believe, and nobody tells me what to believe.
[02:38:26.848 --> 02:38:29.010]  And that was your dad that taught you, think for yourself.
[02:38:29.010 --> 02:38:29.791]  I mean, my father...
[02:38:30.411 --> 02:38:33.573]  I mean, he almost gave me the same statements about don't be a parrot.
[02:38:33.573 --> 02:38:34.393]  Think for yourself.
[02:38:34.393 --> 02:38:36.694]  There's an agenda in the media.
[02:38:36.694 --> 02:38:38.975]  You know, our government's supposed to be small.
[02:38:38.975 --> 02:38:41.376]  Historically, governments are destructive.
[02:38:41.376 --> 02:38:45.658]  Now, that's seen as extremist by Chris Matthews, but that's Thomas Jefferson.
[02:38:45.658 --> 02:38:48.459]  That's authentic American.
[02:38:48.459 --> 02:38:49.860]  You know, don't get into debt.
[02:38:49.860 --> 02:38:51.100]  Work hard.
[02:38:51.100 --> 02:38:52.381]  Only trust your family.
[02:38:52.381 --> 02:38:54.102]  Always stick up for your family.
[02:38:54.102 --> 02:38:56.983]  That is demonized today, but that's what made this country great.
[02:38:57.583 --> 02:38:59.424]  I mean, who is Chris Matthews?
[02:38:59.424 --> 02:39:00.885]  What has this guy ever done?
[02:39:00.885 --> 02:39:03.026]  What is he, a PR guy?
[02:39:03.026 --> 02:39:06.847]  For a congressman or a senator or something?
[02:39:06.847 --> 02:39:07.088]  Yeah.
[02:39:07.088 --> 02:39:07.828]  Before this?
[02:39:07.828 --> 02:39:09.729]  I mean, they're nothing.
[02:39:09.729 --> 02:39:10.509]  Tim Russett.
[02:39:10.509 --> 02:39:12.310]  Everybody used to bow down to him.
[02:39:12.310 --> 02:39:14.291]  Another PR flack.
[02:39:14.291 --> 02:39:16.152]  That's all they are.
[02:39:16.152 --> 02:39:17.873]  They're all yes-men.
[02:39:17.873 --> 02:39:20.674]  There's not a man among them.
[02:39:20.674 --> 02:39:26.177]  They all work in the Washington Beltway circle, jerk.
[02:39:26.997 --> 02:39:29.819]  None of them stands up and stands out.
[02:39:29.819 --> 02:39:36.003]  Even this guy, Bill Mayer, who, oh, you know, he's a wise guy, this or that.
[02:39:36.003 --> 02:39:45.248]  I remember when he retracted his statement when he said the one thing you couldn't call the terrorists on 9-11 were cowards.
[02:39:45.248 --> 02:39:46.669]  They're cowards.
[02:39:46.669 --> 02:39:49.131]  The paycheck comes first.
[02:39:49.131 --> 02:39:52.012]  There's not a man among them.
[02:39:52.012 --> 02:39:54.194]  There's not a man in the White House.
[02:39:54.714 --> 02:39:59.997]  There never has been in my lifetime other than Eisenhower.
[02:39:59.997 --> 02:40:07.901]  Well, I want to get into the war, and when you see the economy imploding in more detail, that's in the current Trends Forecast Journal.
[02:40:07.901 --> 02:40:23.109]  But before we do that, we were talking during the break about how Chris Matthews, on a best night, has 500,000 viewers, and how medium-sized syndicated shows like this one have millions, several million conservatively, about a million more each week on the internet, about three million total.
[02:40:23.709 --> 02:40:45.541]  Chris Matthews is a legend in his own mind, but because there's a teleprompter, because there's a fancy suit, because there's a bunch of reporters, still some people watching it think it has all this gravitas and authority, but that illusion is now dying, but Chris Matthews and others still think their propaganda is working, and that's a big deal that whoever they attack
[02:40:46.181 --> 02:40:48.304]  Suddenly goes up in the polls.
[02:40:48.304 --> 02:40:58.857]  I mean, don't these delusional monkeys get and understand that their free ride lying to people and bamboozling and scamming and hoodwinking is coming to an end?
[02:41:00.365 --> 02:41:03.568]  Not until I get fired and the ratings keep slipping.
[02:41:03.568 --> 02:41:05.550]  Look what's happened to CNN.
[02:41:05.550 --> 02:41:09.054]  You know, I've just come up with a new pledge.
[02:41:09.054 --> 02:41:11.256]  I'm not going on any more of these shows anymore.
[02:41:11.256 --> 02:41:12.718]  I'm very selective.
[02:41:12.718 --> 02:41:17.843]  And if any of them want to do it, they could come over to my place and they could interview me.
[02:41:17.843 --> 02:41:19.064]  And they're not going to edit it.
[02:41:19.064 --> 02:41:21.987]  We're going to do it live because I know the game.
[02:41:21.987 --> 02:41:23.429]  I've been around a long time.
[02:41:23.809 --> 02:41:29.192]  When you're in charge of the controls, like they are, you can make it look like anything.
[02:41:29.192 --> 02:41:33.674]  So why should I give my valuable time up to them?
[02:41:33.674 --> 02:41:36.216]  What have they ever accomplished?
[02:41:36.216 --> 02:41:38.497]  What have they ever done?
[02:41:38.497 --> 02:41:45.161]  They're broadcast blowhards and suck-ups to the political system.
[02:41:45.161 --> 02:41:49.123]  So why should I go on their shows to boost their ratings?
[02:41:49.123 --> 02:41:50.063]  Well, yeah, that's the headline.
[02:41:51.425 --> 02:41:54.346]  CNN has lost more than half its viewers in one year.
[02:41:54.346 --> 02:41:56.586]  They lost half their viewers the year before that.
[02:41:56.586 --> 02:42:06.209]  I mean, they're going to be down to 50,000 viewers on their lowest show, 200,000 on their biggest, if the trend continues in six months, according to the Associated Press.
[02:42:06.209 --> 02:42:08.969]  Their top show, Larry King has a million.
[02:42:08.969 --> 02:42:10.270]  By the way, it's going to be a hot show tonight.
[02:42:10.270 --> 02:42:12.790]  I talked to Ventura a few days ago, and I can now talk about it.
[02:42:12.790 --> 02:42:16.031]  He's been on there with Oliver Stone, talking about New World Order.
[02:42:16.351 --> 02:42:23.842]  So now they're forced to let Ventura and Stone on who will actually talk about real issues desperately to keep any viewers.
[02:42:23.842 --> 02:42:25.405]  So that's actually smart of Larry King.
[02:42:26.221 --> 02:42:27.182]  You mean Larry King?
[02:42:27.182 --> 02:42:28.823]  Is Larry King live?
[02:42:28.823 --> 02:42:30.624]  Or Larry King almost dead?
[02:42:30.624 --> 02:42:32.865]  I mean, come on!
[02:42:32.865 --> 02:42:34.426]  When are they going to try something new?
[02:42:34.426 --> 02:42:35.887]  They're not going to do anything.
[02:42:35.887 --> 02:42:36.987]  They don't want it.
[02:42:36.987 --> 02:42:38.908]  I know the inside scoop.
[02:42:38.908 --> 02:42:41.510]  They want no one with a personality.
[02:42:41.510 --> 02:42:44.732]  They're white bread through and through.
[02:42:44.732 --> 02:42:47.033]  It hurts the advertisers.
[02:42:47.033 --> 02:42:49.154]  Let's get to the bottom line here.
[02:42:49.154 --> 02:42:51.575]  A guy like me, I'm bad for business.
[02:42:51.575 --> 02:42:54.497]  I'm telling people, don't buy anything you don't need.
[02:42:54.497 --> 02:42:55.658]  I'm telling people that
[02:42:56.158 --> 02:43:08.209]  You're going to keep buying stocks in a market like this as they bring out all these shills on CNBC and other places saying, this is a good buying opportunity.
[02:43:08.209 --> 02:43:10.011]  Stocks are at a low.
[02:43:10.011 --> 02:43:11.673]  Yeah, stocks are at a low.
[02:43:11.673 --> 02:43:14.295]  They're at a 1999 low.
[02:43:14.295 --> 02:43:15.796]  Remember they told you, Alex,
[02:43:16.397 --> 02:43:19.421]  You know, you have to stay in it for the long term.
[02:43:19.421 --> 02:43:21.824]  Hey, wasn't the Nasdaq in 2000 at $5,000?
[02:43:21.824 --> 02:43:23.146]  And now it's touching $2,000?
[02:43:23.146 --> 02:43:25.169]  What is the long term?
[02:43:25.169 --> 02:43:26.591]  A couple of generations?
[02:43:32.939 --> 02:43:39.424]  Oh, and how about those wonderful legacy stocks like Lehman Brothers and General Motors?
[02:43:39.424 --> 02:43:41.686]  No, they don't want me on.
[02:43:41.686 --> 02:43:43.127]  I'm not going on anymore.
[02:43:43.127 --> 02:43:45.229]  I'm telling you, I'm very selective.
[02:43:45.229 --> 02:43:48.071]  I get requests, I turn them down.
[02:43:48.071 --> 02:43:49.112]  I don't need them.
[02:43:49.112 --> 02:43:50.853]  Well, I've noticed I only see you now.
[02:43:52.054 --> 02:44:03.472]  I noticed the YouTubes I see of recent, because I don't watch TV, I end up watching aggregate clips, I don't watch a lot of TV to be accurate, but I noticed I only see you on Fox mainly when it's live.
[02:44:04.554 --> 02:44:05.414]  Yes, exactly.
[02:44:05.414 --> 02:44:09.816]  I won't go on any tape shows, because they do what they do to you.
[02:44:09.816 --> 02:44:11.637]  They sandbag you.
[02:44:11.637 --> 02:44:13.618]  You can do anything with editing.
[02:44:13.618 --> 02:44:15.439]  And again, these aren't men.
[02:44:15.439 --> 02:44:17.759]  There's not a man among them.
[02:44:17.759 --> 02:44:24.242]  They're big mouths when they're in their little power bases, just like politicians.
[02:44:24.242 --> 02:44:25.763]  The red carpet crowd.
[02:44:26.243 --> 02:44:44.788]  You know, they show up in these huge airplanes, you know, they salute, they walk down the gangplank, a red carpet comes out, they strike up the band and they have a parade, and they have all their guards around them, and the crowd is, you know, a hundred yards away.
[02:44:44.788 --> 02:44:47.349]  Let's talk man-to-man over here.
[02:44:47.349 --> 02:44:51.290]  You'll never get one of them do it, because they're little babies.
[02:44:51.670 --> 02:44:54.851]  They're only tough in their own arena.
[02:44:54.851 --> 02:45:00.454]  If they want to come over and talk to me, man-to-man, we could have a man-to-man conversation.
[02:45:00.454 --> 02:45:02.015]  They'll never do it.
[02:45:02.015 --> 02:45:04.196]  There's not a man among them.
[02:45:04.196 --> 02:45:06.577]  They're political suck-ups.
[02:45:06.577 --> 02:45:07.077]  All of them.
[02:45:07.731 --> 02:45:18.260]  Well, when you have a bunch of cowards running your society who say yes to everything, the worst is going to gravitate to the top and they're going to become disconnected from reality and they're going to destroy their own tyranny.
[02:45:18.260 --> 02:45:31.311]  That's the good news is they've created such a tsunami of robbing and looting and stealing that Merkel two weeks ago had to put her own blocks in to stop the Wall Street and London banks bringing Germany down.
[02:45:31.311 --> 02:45:32.452]  And that brings me back to
[02:45:33.112 --> 02:45:36.937]  You got cut off at the last break and we went off into another subject because I went there.
[02:45:36.937 --> 02:45:40.401]  Gerald, you're talking about war sooner rather than later.
[02:45:40.401 --> 02:45:46.809]  You're saying you believe the full collapse will come by the end of 2010.
[02:45:46.809 --> 02:45:49.252]  Give us the full breakdown.
[02:45:49.252 --> 02:45:49.993]  Let's go through this.
[02:45:50.953 --> 02:45:52.754]  The crash of 2010 is happening.
[02:45:52.754 --> 02:45:58.616]  We saw it with the Dow taking a dive and continue to do so as the rest of the world equity markets.
[02:45:58.616 --> 02:46:07.419]  The United States has spent, lent, and guaranteed $13 trillion to bail out this system, including bailing out the commercial real estate sector.
[02:46:07.699 --> 02:46:09.980]  This has gone on worldwide.
[02:46:09.980 --> 02:46:13.141]  The whole EU has done it with their cheap money.
[02:46:13.141 --> 02:46:18.802]  Australia, the UK, Japan, South Korea, and China of course.
[02:46:18.802 --> 02:46:22.323]  But China could afford to do it because they have surpluses.
[02:46:22.323 --> 02:46:23.684]  It's all running out now.
[02:46:24.204 --> 02:46:27.205]  So now we're going to start seeing the collapse.
[02:46:27.205 --> 02:46:30.886]  That's why gold prices are what now?
[02:46:30.886 --> 02:46:33.887]  What, $1,200, about $40, $30?
[02:46:33.887 --> 02:46:36.048]  Yeah, it's world record.
[02:46:36.048 --> 02:46:37.048]  World record in Europe.
[02:46:37.048 --> 02:46:38.329]  World record here.
[02:46:38.329 --> 02:46:41.710]  And the Europeans know the deal, and they're going to keep buying more of it.
[02:46:42.350 --> 02:46:45.932]  Then we're going to see more talk about war.
[02:46:45.932 --> 02:46:48.074]  And that's how they divert the attention.
[02:46:48.074 --> 02:46:50.355]  History is only repeating itself.
[02:46:50.355 --> 02:46:53.077]  The same thing happened in the late 1920s.
[02:46:53.077 --> 02:47:00.082]  Markets crash, depressions, recessions set in, social unrest builds, and what do they do?
[02:47:00.082 --> 02:47:01.283]  They take you to war.
[02:47:13.231 --> 02:47:14.911]  And how about that Saddam Hussein?
[02:47:14.911 --> 02:47:19.794]  Remember his weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al-Qaeda?
[02:47:19.794 --> 02:47:21.975]  And remember the Gulf of Tom Kitten?
[02:47:21.975 --> 02:47:23.436]  Remember the Maine?
[02:47:23.436 --> 02:47:25.717]  But Bin Laden was on the Maine!
[02:47:25.717 --> 02:47:29.679]  Bin Laden was on the Maine in Havana Harbor in 1898, Gerald, come on!
[02:47:30.379 --> 02:47:32.120]  There are no conspiracy theories.
[02:47:32.120 --> 02:47:33.380]  Yeah, you're right.
[02:47:33.380 --> 02:47:36.522]  And you know, you were talking before, we were talking about these wimps.
[02:47:36.522 --> 02:47:39.864]  Look at Obama, the cheap trick with him going out there.
[02:47:39.864 --> 02:47:41.745]  I'm gonna kick ass.
[02:47:41.745 --> 02:47:45.326]  Yeah, he's gonna throw sharp elbows on them.
[02:47:45.326 --> 02:47:48.248]  Well, the word on him is all he does is hang around in bathhouses.
[02:47:49.188 --> 02:47:56.355]  So, I mean, this whole thing is a disgusting spectacle, and the people need to realize who's in control.
[02:47:56.355 --> 02:48:04.182]  Remember the guys in high school and college that wanted to be the class presidents and the head of the student council?
[02:48:04.182 --> 02:48:13.910]  The guys that, you know, were suck-ups, that were brown-nosers, that were never sincere, glad-handers, and only out for themselves?
[02:48:14.611 --> 02:48:16.453]  The people that you couldn't stand.
[02:48:29.568 --> 02:48:30.288]  Exactly.
[02:48:30.288 --> 02:48:37.230]  And these are now our senators, our secretaries of this and that, our presidents.
[02:48:37.230 --> 02:48:38.811]  That's all they are.
[02:48:38.811 --> 02:48:45.413]  The same people we couldn't stand in high school and college are now telling us what to do.
[02:48:45.413 --> 02:48:50.274]  And the reason they get away with it again, it's the red carpet crowd.
[02:48:50.274 --> 02:48:53.535]  It's the pomp that they keep showing the public.
[02:48:54.395 --> 02:48:56.336]  I mean, you talk about going into Iran.
[02:48:56.336 --> 02:48:58.396]  How do you see that unfolding?
[02:48:58.396 --> 02:49:03.098]  A, and then B, you did say the stimulus would run out in 2010.
[02:49:03.098 --> 02:49:06.719]  You called it the O-8 situation two, three years before.
[02:49:06.719 --> 02:49:10.800]  You've called that accurately, and some of the other great economists we've had on have been accurate.
[02:49:10.800 --> 02:49:19.743]  So that's what's scary, is that all the experts are agreeing, and you can see, and now the mainstream media is finally admitting an implosion is accelerating.
[02:49:21.303 --> 02:49:25.488]  I mean, you're saying you see this really happening by the end of this year.
[02:49:25.488 --> 02:49:29.832]  Clearly, the economy is already on its back like a turtle that can't get up.
[02:49:29.832 --> 02:49:32.275]  Describe that in detail, how you see it unfolding.
[02:49:32.275 --> 02:49:34.778]  Alright, first on the war.
[02:49:34.778 --> 02:49:40.804]  Iran is talking about now bringing the ship into Gaza of relief goods.
[02:49:41.525 --> 02:49:43.967]  That could be a conflict right there.
[02:49:43.967 --> 02:49:56.035]  Israel is on the edge continually looking for an excuse, as is being reported, to invade Iran to knock out their nuclear capabilities at any level.
[02:49:56.035 --> 02:50:00.538]  The United States keeps demonizing Iran continually.
[02:50:01.258 --> 02:50:07.920]  And so we see something happening as a flashpoint and of course it'll be a false flag.
[02:50:07.920 --> 02:50:12.321]  We will put no credence in it at all if there's an attack against Iran.
[02:50:12.321 --> 02:50:13.882]  That's the worst scenario.
[02:50:13.882 --> 02:50:17.183]  And that's the one we think is going to unfold.
[02:50:17.183 --> 02:50:21.084]  On the economic level, there are a million wildcards out there.
[02:50:21.944 --> 02:50:26.107]  Europe looks like the best one now, but there could be a huge collapse.
[02:50:26.107 --> 02:50:37.295]  By the way, Alex, every Saturday morning, you pick up the newspaper and buried in on the bottom somewhere is another five banks that fail.
[02:50:37.435 --> 02:50:38.115]  All right, stay there.
[02:50:38.115 --> 02:50:42.337]  We're going to come back with a segment on the economy with Gerald Cilente.
[02:50:42.337 --> 02:50:44.938]  Then your phone calls are coming up for the next 30 minutes.
[02:50:44.938 --> 02:50:50.980]  He's been gracious to spend this much time with us, Gerald Cilente, and we'll also give you his website as well when we come back.
[02:50:50.980 --> 02:50:57.423]  Of course, if you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, you can see it right behind him, but it's just such valuable information.
[02:50:57.423 --> 02:51:00.304]  Gerald Cilente, I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.

[02:52:01.008 --> 02:52:03.410]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:03.410 --> 02:52:05.732]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:05.732 --> 02:52:08.934]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:08.934 --> 02:52:14.039]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:14.039 --> 02:52:18.242]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.542 --> 02:52:21.003]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:21.003 --> 02:52:23.445]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:23.445 --> 02:52:26.687]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:26.687 --> 02:52:34.291]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.631 --> 02:52:40.033]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:40.033 --> 02:52:42.873]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:42.873 --> 02:52:46.554]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:46.554 --> 02:52:47.635]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:47.635 --> 02:52:48.975]  You're everyone else.
[02:52:48.975 --> 02:52:50.476]  Invisible Empire.

[02:53:00.390 --> 02:53:01.330]  Here's a question.
[02:53:01.330 --> 02:53:07.532]  If you have a septic system, did you know that proper maintenance can save you thousands of dollars in costly and unnecessary repairs?
[02:53:07.532 --> 02:53:08.912]  The answer is simple.
[02:53:08.912 --> 02:53:13.013]  Use septic system injector treatments made specifically for your home or business.

[02:53:52.129 --> 02:53:52.549]  That's 508-759-0010.
[02:54:06.345 --> 02:54:09.686]  By the way, he is part of two of my films.
[02:54:09.686 --> 02:54:11.967]  I appreciate him appearing in them.
[02:54:11.967 --> 02:54:17.108]  One of the key analysts we have in Fall of the Republic and The Obama Deception.
[02:54:17.108 --> 02:54:24.591]  Both of these films break down who the globalists are, how they set up the banking scam, how they're taking over, and what their plan is going to be into this year and the next.
[02:54:25.171 --> 02:54:27.093]  So this is kind of a video trends forecast.
[02:54:27.093 --> 02:54:34.620]  I hope you'll get them both at Infowars.com and the new film we just released, Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined.
[02:54:34.620 --> 02:54:35.360]  So important.
[02:54:35.360 --> 02:54:37.002]  Knowledge is power.
[02:54:37.002 --> 02:54:40.505]  And it's also important in these rough times to support the alternative media.
[02:54:40.505 --> 02:54:42.948]  That's a separate subject I'm going to bring up with Gerald in the next hour.
[02:54:42.948 --> 02:54:50.635]  The open calls everywhere to shut down the internet, to censor talk radio, to have government licenses to be a journalist.
[02:54:51.115 --> 02:54:55.120]  I mean, the system is in trouble when they openly want to shut down free speech.
[02:54:55.120 --> 02:55:00.886]  But Gerald Salenta, you were getting into opening the paper up 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, depending on the day.
[02:55:00.886 --> 02:55:04.991]  Every day, banks are being shut down by the federal regulators.
[02:55:04.991 --> 02:55:05.591]  Please continue.
[02:55:06.468 --> 02:55:09.952]  Yes, the Federal Reserve is effectively bankrupt.
[02:55:09.952 --> 02:55:19.962]  And what we're saying is that when there is a terrorist strike, and there will be, we're forecasting one of 9-11 magnitude, this time they're going to close the banks.
[02:55:19.962 --> 02:55:21.764]  The last time they closed Wall Street.
[02:55:22.344 --> 02:55:31.586]  But of course, the last time in 2001, you know, we were getting over the dot-com bubble bursting, and the conditions were very bad, but nothing like today.
[02:55:31.586 --> 02:55:35.027]  So they were able to lower interest rates back then.
[02:55:35.027 --> 02:55:36.907]  Now they're at near zero.
[02:55:36.907 --> 02:55:42.868]  I mean, I know they're talking about negative interest rates, but that's not going to work.
[02:55:42.868 --> 02:55:47.389]  So this time, in order to stop the panic, we believe they're going to close the banks.
[02:55:47.389 --> 02:55:51.050]  But the point being is that the banks are already in trouble.
[02:55:51.670 --> 02:55:55.031]  There is not going to be a recovery.
[02:55:55.031 --> 02:55:58.193]  It shows up in the job numbers.
[02:55:58.193 --> 02:56:03.795]  And then you have these analysts saying, well, it's a jobless recovery.
[02:56:03.795 --> 02:56:06.996]  Yeah, how about being almost pregnant, as I say?
[02:56:06.996 --> 02:56:08.317]  You know, there's no such thing.
[02:56:08.317 --> 02:56:14.419]  You have to create jobs with 72% consumer-oriented society.
[02:56:14.419 --> 02:56:16.320]  No jobs, no consumption.
[02:56:16.880 --> 02:56:25.225]  And then what we're looking at, as I said, as when they can no longer hide the failures, they take us to war.
[02:56:25.225 --> 02:56:29.968]  And the war looks like it's going to be, at this point, with Iran.
[02:56:29.968 --> 02:56:35.171]  And when it does happen, we don't believe the reasons they give us will be real.
[02:56:35.171 --> 02:56:43.837]  It'll be a false flag, as it was with weapons of mass destruction and ties to al-Qaeda, the Gulf of Tompkins, and others.
[02:56:44.537 --> 02:56:48.000]  But, in the Gulf of Tonkin in 64, Bin Laden was there.
[02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:50.282]  You know, that's another question.
[02:56:50.282 --> 02:56:58.388]  Why are they getting so arrogant to have the CIA in Spy Talk, in the Washington Post, Weekly Column, admit they put out fake Bin Laden videos?
[02:56:58.388 --> 02:57:07.255]  Why is Handlebar Mustache Geraldo Rivera talking to the Marine Corps Colonel, admitting that our government has the troops growing the opium?
[02:57:08.516 --> 02:57:09.938]  Before, they would at least lie.
[02:57:09.938 --> 02:57:12.222]  More and more, they're going, yeah, we shipped the opium out.
[02:57:12.222 --> 02:57:14.185]  Yeah, we're putting fake videos out.
[02:57:14.185 --> 02:57:16.850]  Yeah, we won't tell you where the trillions in bailout money went.
[02:57:16.850 --> 02:57:20.916]  I mean, it looks like they've almost shifted tactics to just, like, hiding it in plain view now.
[02:57:22.264 --> 02:57:26.727]  You know, as I said before, these aren't the brightest people.
[02:57:26.727 --> 02:57:28.969]  They're given too much credit.
[02:57:28.969 --> 02:57:30.790]  They're losers.
[02:57:30.790 --> 02:57:34.872]  Again, everything they touch, they turn to rot.
[02:57:34.872 --> 02:57:40.736]  Whether it's education, healthcare, wars, environment, you name it, food.
[02:57:40.736 --> 02:57:42.598]  So yeah, they're not the brightest people.
[02:57:42.598 --> 02:57:50.143]  And look, the CIA is admitting that they're waging a war with these predator drones in Pakistan.
[02:57:50.743 --> 02:57:55.124]  Since when did the CIA get into the war business overtly?
[02:57:55.124 --> 02:58:09.929]  And since when is it not against international law to perform extrajudicial killings by killing, quote, suspected terrorists in sovereign countries by sending drones in?
[02:58:09.929 --> 02:58:14.430]  So it's their arrogance and also possibly their ignorance.
[02:58:17.096 --> 02:58:23.500]  Well, Gerald Salente, the Trends Research Analyst, the founder of Trends Research, is our guest for another 30 minutes.
[02:58:23.500 --> 02:58:29.363]  We're going to take your calls, go to Twitter, questions, and a lot more straight ahead when we begin the fourth hour.
[02:58:29.363 --> 02:58:38.408]  And, you know, we talk about this so much, I don't want people to get mental fatigue when we're discussing depression and wars, because it's already ongoing.
[02:58:38.408 --> 02:58:42.751]  It's going to get worse.
[02:58:42.751 --> 02:58:44.672]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.345 --> 02:58:48.516]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today!

[02:59:53.743 --> 02:59:56.128]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.128 --> 02:59:58.893]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:07.236 --> 03:00:14.921]  Wow, Gerald Salente saying he thinks they're probably going to stage an attack of some type as a false flag to go into Iran.
[03:00:14.921 --> 03:00:17.202]  These are the times that try folks souls.
[03:00:17.202 --> 03:00:18.583]  This is real.
[03:00:18.583 --> 03:00:20.505]  This is happening.
[03:00:20.505 --> 03:00:24.387]  And I catch myself all the time just kind of getting comfortable with the idea of depression.
[03:00:24.387 --> 03:00:26.508]  Comfortable with the idea of World War III.
[03:00:26.508 --> 03:00:26.709]  No!
[03:00:27.429 --> 03:00:28.430]  We need to get angry.
[03:00:28.430 --> 03:00:29.431]  We need to get upset.
[03:00:29.431 --> 03:00:32.353]  We need to get involved.
[03:00:32.353 --> 03:00:40.221]  Gerald Solente, I want to take some calls, but when we come back in the next segment, I want to hear your idea for solutions, 9th, 10th Amendment.
[03:00:40.221 --> 03:00:43.724]  We know where the globalists are going, but how you see the Tea Party movement
[03:00:44.164 --> 03:00:45.485]  Gerald, Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[03:00:45.485 --> 03:00:52.611]  Question is, with the oil volcano going on in the Gulf of Mexico right now, I read an article this morning where the PSI coming out of that hole could be 20,000 PSI or greater.
[03:01:14.457 --> 03:01:16.698]  And they may not be able to cap it.
[03:01:16.698 --> 03:01:30.904]  Can that event, being very catastrophic with the toxins, the fishing industry getting destroyed, the tourism, can that event cause the collapse to happen earlier rather than later in your six month prediction?
[03:01:32.206 --> 03:01:34.066]  Uh, probably not.
[03:01:34.066 --> 03:01:39.548]  It's a terrible event, but there are much bigger economic issues around it.
[03:01:39.548 --> 03:01:47.389]  But the other part of that is that to get the people's mind off that, war will do that.
[03:01:47.389 --> 03:01:49.189]  I agree, I agree.
[03:01:49.189 --> 03:01:53.050]  They're using the oil as a nice distraction while they're getting their war ready.
[03:01:53.050 --> 03:02:01.232]  And it would go back to when the oil spill first began, and then we saw that Times Square bomber pop up.
[03:02:02.333 --> 03:02:04.955]  And the oil went out of the media.
[03:02:04.955 --> 03:02:06.997]  And that's what can happen again.
[03:02:06.997 --> 03:02:14.703]  So if there's a terrorist strike or a war, something of that nature, this thing will be flushed out of the news very quickly.
[03:02:14.703 --> 03:02:27.693]  Yeah, they decide, but more and more they're losing control of the media, and we'll talk about their attempt at media censorship later, but look at Haiti, 200,000 plus dead, thousands, I've seen numbers, thousands dying a week, the total collapse of society.
[03:02:27.693 --> 03:02:29.054]  You don't hear about Haiti anymore.
[03:02:29.750 --> 03:02:30.610]  No.
[03:02:30.610 --> 03:02:31.891]  No, you don't.
[03:02:31.891 --> 03:02:39.593]  And again, this tragedy that's going on in the Gulf, it looks like it's going to continue going on.
[03:02:39.593 --> 03:02:44.235]  And the implications are exactly what the koalas said, are very far-reaching.
[03:02:44.235 --> 03:02:49.437]  Whether it's the feed supplies, you know, it just keeps going on and on.
[03:02:50.256 --> 03:02:56.298]  The fish, the oysters, most of our seafood, oysters and shrimp is coming out of the Gulf.
[03:02:56.298 --> 03:03:02.880]  I mean, the tourism, I mean, this is going to decimate Florida and Louisiana and Mississippi.
[03:03:02.880 --> 03:03:08.702]  And then they show the tidal forces, it's going to go around Florida and up the East Coast.
[03:03:08.702 --> 03:03:14.985]  And meanwhile, the feds are so tightly controlling this, now they're talking about using nuclear weapons to stop it.
[03:03:14.985 --> 03:03:15.805]  I mean, this is insane.
[03:03:16.656 --> 03:03:27.502]  Yeah, oh, the other part of the food chain is, you know, the fish meal and all the residue from the fish that are used for, you know, for feeds and for fertilizers.
[03:03:27.502 --> 03:03:29.964]  So this thing just keeps going on and on.
[03:03:29.964 --> 03:03:38.889]  But again, they're going to, we believe there's going to be a 9-11 magnitude terror strike before this year is over.
[03:03:39.429 --> 03:03:48.551]  And that the concept of war will become more and more of a given as we get closer to financial disaster.
[03:03:48.551 --> 03:03:54.373]  And again, just turn on the news, look what's going on with the world equity markets.
[03:03:54.373 --> 03:04:03.715]  Regardless of all this baloney you're hearing about being a good buying opportunity and profit margins are still very high, the collapse is coming.
[03:04:04.741 --> 03:04:05.301]  Well said.
[03:04:05.301 --> 03:04:13.808]  We're going to come back and go to Pete in Calgary, Alberta, Mark in Oregon, Mark in California, Greg in Kansas, and others.
[03:04:13.808 --> 03:04:16.670]  The total free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[03:04:16.670 --> 03:04:21.834]  We've only got about 45 seconds, but what about media censorship, Gerald?
[03:04:21.834 --> 03:04:26.278]  We're really seeing them start to hype that the American way is to shut down free speech.
[03:04:26.903 --> 03:04:43.941]  Well, we heard President Obama say that in so many words when he warned about all these other voices out there that you have to be careful about because you're getting them over the internet and not from the mainstream media as though they're the ones that you should believe.
[03:04:45.322 --> 03:04:46.063]  Absolutely.
[03:04:46.063 --> 03:04:46.424]  Stay there.
[03:04:46.424 --> 03:04:52.933]  Let's finish up talking about the attempt at media censorship that's being promoted right now and then we'll go to your calls and a lot more.
[03:04:52.933 --> 03:04:58.501]  But Gerald Cilente, 9-11 magnitude attack sometime in the next six to seven months.
[03:04:58.501 --> 03:04:59.282]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:59.282 --> 03:04:59.682]  Stay with us.
[03:05:01.325 --> 03:05:04.346]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:04.346 --> 03:05:09.668]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:05:09.668 --> 03:05:11.709]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:05:11.709 --> 03:05:16.710]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:16.710 --> 03:05:17.891]  How much do you want?
[03:05:17.891 --> 03:05:18.631]  When do you want it?
[03:05:19.011 --> 03:05:20.891]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:20.891 --> 03:05:21.972]  When will you need it?
[03:05:21.972 --> 03:05:24.172]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:24.172 --> 03:05:25.513]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:25.513 --> 03:05:27.033]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:27.033 --> 03:05:32.314]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:32.314 --> 03:05:35.895]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:35.895 --> 03:05:39.356]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:39.716 --> 03:05:40.937]  How much will you need?
[03:05:40.937 --> 03:05:41.838]  We don't know.
[03:05:41.838 --> 03:05:42.938]  How much do you want?
[03:05:42.938 --> 03:05:43.859]  All you can get.
[03:05:43.859 --> 03:05:44.960]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:44.960 --> 03:05:48.022]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:05:48.022 --> 03:05:49.783]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:05:49.783 --> 03:05:50.704]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:02.247 --> 03:06:06.208]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:06:06.208 --> 03:06:15.069]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[03:06:15.069 --> 03:06:19.710]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[03:06:19.710 --> 03:06:30.512]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[03:06:31.152 --> 03:06:40.674]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:06:40.674 --> 03:06:46.096]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[03:06:46.096 --> 03:06:53.577]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:06:53.577 --> 03:06:56.338]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[03:07:00.182 --> 03:07:04.725]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:07:04.725 --> 03:07:05.645]  Number 1.
[03:07:05.645 --> 03:07:09.068]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:07:09.068 --> 03:07:09.928]  Number 2.
[03:07:09.928 --> 03:07:14.811]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:07:14.811 --> 03:07:15.552]  It's true.
[03:07:15.552 --> 03:07:20.435]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:07:20.435 --> 03:07:21.255]  Number 3.
[03:07:21.255 --> 03:07:24.838]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:07:24.838 --> 03:07:28.540]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:07:28.740 --> 03:07:29.540]  Number 4.
[03:07:29.540 --> 03:07:32.302]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:07:32.302 --> 03:07:35.983]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:07:35.983 --> 03:07:36.763]  Number 5.
[03:07:36.763 --> 03:07:40.925]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:07:40.925 --> 03:07:45.967]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:07:45.967 --> 03:07:50.149]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:07:50.149 --> 03:07:51.930]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:07:51.930 --> 03:07:56.532]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[03:07:56.852 --> 03:07:57.472]  877-327-0365.
[03:07:57.472 --> 03:08:06.037]  Oh yeah!
[03:08:06.037 --> 03:08:07.337]  Big Brother.
[03:08:07.337 --> 03:08:09.118]  Mainstream media.
[03:08:09.118 --> 03:08:10.139]  Government cover-up.
[03:08:10.139 --> 03:08:10.999]  Hour number four!
[03:08:10.999 --> 03:08:12.480]  You want answers?
[03:08:12.480 --> 03:08:13.440]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:13.440 --> 03:08:18.203]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:18.203 --> 03:08:22.245]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:23.996 --> 03:08:25.358]  Trends Research.
[03:08:25.358 --> 03:08:25.879]  One word.
[03:08:25.879 --> 03:08:30.685]  TrendsResearch.com is the invaluable Trends Research Institute website.
[03:08:30.685 --> 03:08:36.032]  And Gerald Salente is with us until the bottom of the hour going to your phone calls.
[03:08:36.032 --> 03:08:38.215]  Think of how un-American it is that they have
[03:08:38.916 --> 03:08:39.356]  I don't know.
[03:09:00.310 --> 03:09:02.811]  We are the state, we're the people, First Amendment.
[03:09:02.811 --> 03:09:15.593]  Open talk of taking over talk radio, the internet, the FTC, in the news, saying we want to fund mainline newspapers and TV with taxes on the internet and iPhones.
[03:09:15.593 --> 03:09:18.414]  I mean, this is an amazing development.
[03:09:18.414 --> 03:09:26.335]  They finally realized they've lost all credibility, so now they're everywhere sending up trial balloons telling us how American it is to ban our free speech.
[03:09:26.335 --> 03:09:27.596]  I mean, this is tyranny.
[03:09:30.006 --> 03:09:35.148]  As they keep losing more and more control, they will exert more and more control.
[03:09:35.148 --> 03:09:36.689]  That's what's going on.
[03:09:36.689 --> 03:09:38.730]  They know they're losing it.
[03:09:38.730 --> 03:09:44.733]  As I said, and I will say it again, the merger of state and corporate powers
[03:09:45.233 --> 03:09:55.640]  Just as you pointed out, by giving our taxpayer money to whether it's the media or the banks or the too-big-to-fails is called fascism.
[03:09:55.640 --> 03:09:59.422]  And fascism has come to America.
[03:09:59.422 --> 03:10:07.408]  They will do anything they can to stop their loss of power and they're losing it by the seconds.
[03:10:07.728 --> 03:10:10.189]  Well, it's a criminal buy-off.
[03:10:10.189 --> 03:10:23.035]  Remember in Congress in hearings just last year, it came out that the Democratic Party went and looked at records, and if your Chevy dealership, one of them was set up in like 1916 in Minnesota in one case was on the news, if you hadn't given money to the Democrats,
[03:10:23.655 --> 03:10:26.276]  And you were a Republican to show the infighting.
[03:10:26.276 --> 03:10:33.980]  The government took your dealership, literally in one case, worth tens of millions of dollars, and gave it to a Democrat contributor.
[03:10:33.980 --> 03:10:47.027]  I mean, this is Chicago mob, and now it's coming out that the White House Chief of Staff, who we notice is laying low, Rahm Emanuel, that this guy, for years as a Congressman, had a donor paying for his house in D.C.
[03:10:47.027 --> 03:10:49.468]  I mean, ten years ago you went to prison for that.
[03:10:49.468 --> 03:10:51.369]  Now they just say, hey, we're gangsters.
[03:10:53.439 --> 03:10:57.844]  Yeah, the only people that go to prison and do hard time are we the people.
[03:10:57.844 --> 03:11:00.687]  The word justice is misspelled.
[03:11:00.687 --> 03:11:05.532]  It's J-U-S-T-U-S.
[03:11:05.532 --> 03:11:08.215]  Just us, not them.
[03:11:09.016 --> 03:11:10.377]  The game is rigged.
[03:11:10.377 --> 03:11:12.760]  Again, it's Harvard, Princeton, Yale.
[03:11:12.760 --> 03:11:14.181]  You mentioned Kagan.
[03:11:14.181 --> 03:11:16.063]  What am I, a moron?
[03:11:16.063 --> 03:11:21.108]  That the whole Supreme Court is stacked with Harvard and Yale?
[03:11:21.108 --> 03:11:23.830]  The head of the Fed is from Princeton?
[03:11:23.830 --> 03:11:26.113]  They're all better than we are.
[03:11:26.113 --> 03:11:27.114]  Just us.
[03:11:27.754 --> 03:11:29.135]  Not them.
[03:11:29.135 --> 03:11:35.216]  We're the only ones that pay the fines, that get hit by the tax collectors.
[03:11:35.216 --> 03:11:42.379]  You go through, you have two drinks, two glasses of wine, and they breathalyze you.
[03:11:42.379 --> 03:11:49.261]  And if you're a half a meter over it, they'll handcuff you and throw you in jail.
[03:11:50.438 --> 03:11:51.720]  Well, here's an article right here.
[03:11:51.720 --> 03:11:57.852]  You know, I mentioned this and we're going back to calls, but at the start of the show, Amish farming draws rare government scrutiny.
[03:11:58.840 --> 03:12:06.885]  And it says you would think with their simplistic living they'd be good, but no, the cows defecating is seen as pollution now.
[03:12:06.885 --> 03:12:15.410]  And it goes on to admit that the feds don't even go inspect big giant dirty Tyson's facilities, but now they're harassing the little Amish.
[03:12:15.410 --> 03:12:22.214]  I see reports every week where they're arresting people selling eggs and watermelons on the side of the road with SWAT teams.
[03:12:22.214 --> 03:12:27.577]  They're sending SWAT teams to little farmers houses who get caught selling watermelons.
[03:12:27.577 --> 03:12:28.538]  I mean, this is the most
[03:12:28.558 --> 03:12:30.379]  It's criminal!
[03:12:30.379 --> 03:12:39.306]  I saw an article last year where a city council in Oklahoma is trying to pass a law that you have to have a license to have a garden.
[03:12:39.306 --> 03:12:41.748]  I mean, these people are crooks!
[03:12:41.748 --> 03:12:52.116]  What's happening, Alex, is the agricultural industry is understanding that a lot of people are buying family farm food and buying local.
[03:12:52.116 --> 03:12:54.318]  It's eroding their profit margins.
[03:12:54.918 --> 03:13:02.607]  By the way, as we saw with this oil spill disaster and we continue to see, they call it a revolving door.
[03:13:02.607 --> 03:13:07.032]  People from business going into government and government going into business.
[03:13:07.032 --> 03:13:09.254]  It's not a revolving door.
[03:13:09.254 --> 03:13:14.720]  It's a wide open door and it's run by the big corporations.
[03:13:14.720 --> 03:13:16.082]  It's not revolving.
[03:13:16.502 --> 03:13:21.106]  So anytime they see a loss going on, they're going to clamp down.
[03:13:21.106 --> 03:13:23.808]  They have the goon squads to do it.
[03:13:23.808 --> 03:13:26.289]  They're going to clamp down on the little people.
[03:13:26.289 --> 03:13:33.075]  That's why the second American revolution is underway.
[03:13:33.075 --> 03:13:34.416]  It's incredible.
[03:13:34.416 --> 03:13:37.478]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[03:13:37.478 --> 03:13:38.999]  Pete in Alberta, Canada.
[03:13:38.999 --> 03:13:39.499]  You're on the air.
[03:13:39.499 --> 03:13:40.980]  All right.
[03:13:40.980 --> 03:13:41.561]  Thanks, gentlemen.
[03:13:42.889 --> 03:13:51.156]  Some of the other cosmic forecasters like Arch Crawford and Cliff High seem to feel strongly that the collapse is going to start in July.
[03:13:51.156 --> 03:13:53.458]  I'm just wondering two things.
[03:13:53.458 --> 03:14:03.668]  If you might make your best guess on what the trigger event might be and then whether the Eurasian Alliance is actually standing up against the Anglo-American Empire.
[03:14:04.349 --> 03:14:06.312]  Or if they're just waiting to join together.
[03:14:06.312 --> 03:14:11.439]  Is there a real split between Russia, China and the Western powers?
[03:14:11.439 --> 03:14:13.582]  And what do you see as a trigger for the total collapse?
[03:14:15.261 --> 03:14:17.622]  As far as the alliance goes, it's all about money.
[03:14:17.622 --> 03:14:20.383]  Whoever cuts the best deal are going to do business with each other.
[03:14:20.383 --> 03:14:22.384]  They'll fight whoever they want.
[03:14:22.384 --> 03:14:23.865]  It's all about money.
[03:14:23.865 --> 03:14:26.105]  So that's the name of that game.
[03:14:26.105 --> 03:14:28.887]  China's only interested in getting money.
[03:14:28.887 --> 03:14:31.287]  And so are the Russians and so are the Americans.
[03:14:31.287 --> 03:14:35.229]  They use democracy and human rights.
[03:14:35.229 --> 03:14:37.150]  Those are phony issues.
[03:14:37.150 --> 03:14:38.650]  What can be the trigger?
[03:14:38.650 --> 03:14:41.171]  We believe it's going to be a currency trigger.
[03:14:41.171 --> 03:14:42.332]  That's our best guess.
[03:14:42.952 --> 03:14:48.877]  Whether it's the collapse of the euro, gold prices skyrocketing could be one of the trends.
[03:14:48.877 --> 03:14:50.338]  Yeah, that's in the New York Times today.
[03:14:50.338 --> 03:14:57.604]  They're admitting that gold going up is exposing derivatives and fake instruments of the central banks.
[03:14:57.604 --> 03:15:01.568]  I mean, it's like holy water to Count Dracula.
[03:15:02.268 --> 03:15:03.028]  Exactly.
[03:15:03.028 --> 03:15:05.209]  So that's what we see it as.
[03:15:05.209 --> 03:15:11.330]  Mostly a financial crisis in terms of currencies and defaults on bonds.
[03:15:11.330 --> 03:15:17.532]  And by the way, why are these people so angry in Europe about paying the bondholders?
[03:15:17.532 --> 03:15:20.333]  Who are the bondholders if a country goes default?
[03:15:20.333 --> 03:15:21.313]  They're the big banks.
[03:15:21.673 --> 03:15:22.253]  That's the one.
[03:15:22.253 --> 03:15:22.813]  That's right.
[03:15:22.813 --> 03:15:38.980]  The taxpayer money goes into the country 100% I mean literally in many cases 100% goes back out to the banks and then the banks take the country's AAA rating away because they had to bail the banks out and the banks loan the money back to the country.
[03:15:40.618 --> 03:15:43.439]  Again, you know, it's the same club in control.
[03:15:43.439 --> 03:15:44.720]  It's all about money.
[03:15:44.720 --> 03:15:50.963]  That's why I said, whatever the alliances are going to be, it's only about money, whatever the best deal is.
[03:15:50.963 --> 03:15:53.364]  Well, from what I've studied, it's China, the U.S.
[03:15:53.364 --> 03:15:56.866]  and Europe are teamed up, and Russia knows it's the odd man out.
[03:15:56.866 --> 03:16:01.708]  I'm not saying Russia isn't corrupt, all these governments are, but Russia is the wild card for my breakdown.
[03:16:01.708 --> 03:16:02.789]  Gerald, what's your take on that?
[03:16:04.068 --> 03:16:05.249]  That's pretty fair.
[03:16:05.249 --> 03:16:08.973]  But again, you know, the Chinese are going to go, they'll go anywhere.
[03:16:08.973 --> 03:16:12.757]  And if they're not doing enough trade, they'll go where they get the most trade.
[03:16:12.757 --> 03:16:16.141]  Look how they're moving into Africa now and buying up so much.
[03:16:16.141 --> 03:16:16.661]  Absolutely.
[03:16:16.661 --> 03:16:18.343]  They're taking over everywhere.
[03:16:18.343 --> 03:16:20.825]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in Oregon.
[03:16:20.825 --> 03:16:23.488]  You're on the air with Gerald Cilente.
[03:16:23.488 --> 03:16:25.470]  Good afternoon, Alex and Gerald.
[03:16:25.470 --> 03:16:26.251]  Great to speak with you.
[03:16:27.089 --> 03:16:30.411]  I have a very quick comment and question for both of you.
[03:16:30.411 --> 03:16:30.631]  Go!
[03:16:30.631 --> 03:16:30.711]  Go!
[03:16:30.711 --> 03:16:30.971]  Good!
[03:16:30.971 --> 03:16:31.572]  Go!
[03:16:31.572 --> 03:16:37.895]  And that is, I think I figured out why Osama Bin Laden and his lieutenants are hiding over in Iraq.
[03:16:37.895 --> 03:16:40.777]  I think they're tired of being killed, don't you think?
[03:16:40.777 --> 03:16:44.739]  They've died two or three times already.
[03:16:44.739 --> 03:16:46.740]  And I'd want to hide, too.
[03:16:46.740 --> 03:16:49.782]  I think I'd get tiresome after the first time.
[03:16:49.782 --> 03:16:51.343]  But A.C.
[03:16:51.343 --> 03:16:55.705]  Griffith, Alex and Gerald, who is a former NSA CIA worker,
[03:16:56.368 --> 03:17:14.542]  He's reported over the last week that FEMA is amassing the infrastructure to displace or evacuate some 40 million people from the Gulf area as well as the East Coast as this oil disaster makes its way up the East Coast.
[03:17:14.542 --> 03:17:19.246]  And he also reported, according to his information on a scientific level, that
[03:17:19.910 --> 03:17:30.382]  Uh, it will drift over the Atlantic Ocean, this, this oil contamination, of course, which is really a dispersant contamination, isolating the benzene, which is very dangerous for health.
[03:17:30.382 --> 03:17:30.703]  Sure, sure.
[03:17:30.703 --> 03:17:33.166]  All the way to Europe, and then eventually around the world.
[03:17:33.166 --> 03:17:35.909]  Well, no, that's what the, that's what the currents show from satellite.
[03:17:35.909 --> 03:17:38.252]  Let me, let me get Gerald Cilente's take on this.
[03:17:38.902 --> 03:17:41.144]  Well, yeah, I mean, I agree.
[03:17:41.144 --> 03:17:45.306]  And it could be a huge disaster and there may be a huge displacement of people.
[03:17:45.306 --> 03:17:54.253]  I mean, this is, this, you know, this is kind of, this kind of fits into those prophecy things that have been made about 2012.
[03:17:54.253 --> 03:17:56.534]  Well, look at the volcano!
[03:17:56.534 --> 03:17:59.596]  The last time they had a big volcano was the French Revolution.
[03:17:59.596 --> 03:18:02.358]  The last time an Icelandic volcano did this.
[03:18:02.358 --> 03:18:04.540]  Yeah.
[03:18:04.540 --> 03:18:05.741]  Sorry, go ahead, you were making your point.
[03:18:06.809 --> 03:18:09.410]  No, no, that is the point.
[03:18:09.410 --> 03:18:13.631]  The point is that we're going to see one catastrophe after another.
[03:18:13.631 --> 03:18:20.613]  Whether it's man-made, natural disaster, financial, environmental, it's all collapsing on itself.
[03:18:20.613 --> 03:18:22.794]  And we've noticed historically, for some reason,
[03:18:23.820 --> 03:18:28.825]  That, for some reason, natural disasters seem to follow times of implosion as well.
[03:18:28.825 --> 03:18:31.468]  It's like my grandma... It takes on its own momentum.
[03:18:31.468 --> 03:18:39.677]  There are so many other forces that we don't know about that are interacting to cause a confluence that we're looking at now.
[03:18:39.677 --> 03:18:41.860]  That's why we're saying that 2010 is the breaking year.
[03:18:44.062 --> 03:19:03.295]  Well, my grandfather told my dad, he wouldn't tell many war stories, about landing in Italy while Vesuvius was exploding, while they were being shot at, because he was in the Army Air Corps, but they were leaving North Africa and actually landing them in the landings, with the Germans shooting at them, with Vesuvius exploding.
[03:19:03.295 --> 03:19:06.117]  And it's just weird how all that stuff seems to run together.
[03:19:06.117 --> 03:19:07.678]  It's strange, isn't it?
[03:19:07.678 --> 03:19:08.179]  Yes, it is.
[03:19:09.329 --> 03:19:09.809]  Amazing.
[03:19:09.809 --> 03:19:11.070]  Gerald Salente is our guest.
[03:19:11.070 --> 03:19:12.992]  Let's jam in one more before we go to break.
[03:19:12.992 --> 03:19:14.693]  Mark in California, you're on the air.
[03:19:14.693 --> 03:19:16.295]  Go ahead.
[03:19:16.295 --> 03:19:19.077]  Hey, thanks for taking my question.
[03:19:19.077 --> 03:19:30.886]  My question revolves around the United Nations Law of the Sea Treaty, and I'm wondering how the Gulf Spill will impact the ongoing debate in Congress, and I'll take my answer off there.
[03:19:30.886 --> 03:19:31.447]  Thanks, guys.
[03:19:31.447 --> 03:19:33.668]  I'm sorry, I didn't hear the... Yeah, say that again.
[03:19:34.791 --> 03:19:39.033]  I'm wondering how the Law of the Sea Treaty debate is going on.
[03:19:39.033 --> 03:19:45.495]  Yes, Law of the Sea Treaty moving through to turn the oceans over to the U.N., which they'll then turn into a giant taxing grid.
[03:19:45.495 --> 03:19:48.196]  Gerald Salente is our guest.
[03:19:48.196 --> 03:19:50.998]  We'll be right back with him here in just a moment.
[03:19:50.998 --> 03:19:53.318]  TrendsResearch.com is the website.
[03:19:53.318 --> 03:19:58.661]  He is the leading trends forecaster in the world, and we're very honored that he spends so much time with us.
[03:19:58.661 --> 03:19:59.301]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:20:01.491 --> 03:20:03.813]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:20:03.813 --> 03:20:06.196]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:20:06.196 --> 03:20:09.399]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:20:09.399 --> 03:20:14.504]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:20:14.504 --> 03:20:18.708]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:20:19.008 --> 03:20:21.371]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:20:21.371 --> 03:20:24.255]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:20:24.255 --> 03:20:27.159]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:20:27.159 --> 03:20:34.769]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:20:35.089 --> 03:20:40.494]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:20:40.494 --> 03:20:43.337]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:20:43.337 --> 03:20:47.021]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:20:47.021 --> 03:20:48.102]  And I got news for you.
[03:20:48.102 --> 03:20:49.443]  You're everyone else.
[03:20:49.443 --> 03:20:50.944]  Invisible Empire.

[03:22:01.365 --> 03:22:04.386]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:22:04.386 --> 03:22:09.708]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:22:09.708 --> 03:22:11.768]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:22:11.768 --> 03:22:16.510]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:22:16.510 --> 03:22:16.850]  I don't know.
[03:22:36.442 --> 03:22:37.062]  Don't answer it!

[03:24:05.135 --> 03:24:07.877]  Yes, Alex, if I can get straight to my question.
[03:24:37.505 --> 03:24:46.097]  Could a possible way to mitigate the economic downturn be for communities who have their own currencies focused around silver?
[03:24:47.898 --> 03:24:56.621]  You know, it's too complicated, and as I keep hearing about these communities trying to do that, it's not really the issue.
[03:24:56.621 --> 03:24:59.983]  The issue is we need a productive capacity.
[03:24:59.983 --> 03:25:01.844]  We have to make things.
[03:25:01.844 --> 03:25:13.028]  We're 300 million people strong, and they put it in our minds that we are unable to manufacture and do business with each
[03:25:13.489 --> 03:25:19.357]  Well, plus humans aren't happy unless they're digging in the dirt or working on things or hammering nails.
[03:25:19.357 --> 03:25:21.220]  We're meant to build things.
[03:25:21.220 --> 03:25:22.682]  We're meant to pick apples.
[03:25:22.682 --> 03:25:24.104]  We're meant to pick figs.
[03:25:24.104 --> 03:25:26.468]  We're meant to be out getting chicken eggs.
[03:25:26.468 --> 03:25:28.731]  We're supposed to be out there working.
[03:25:29.472 --> 03:25:38.155]  Exactly, we've gone from a nation of craftsmen and manufacturers to clerks and cashiers.
[03:25:38.155 --> 03:25:41.356]  Think of the word service sector.
[03:25:41.356 --> 03:25:43.336]  Try servitude.
[03:25:43.336 --> 03:25:44.597]  How about cert?
[03:25:45.506 --> 03:25:48.108]  Does servant fit in well?
[03:25:48.108 --> 03:25:50.430]  That's what they've done to this country.
[03:25:50.430 --> 03:25:56.796]  So the productive capacity that we see, once again, current events form future trends.
[03:25:56.796 --> 03:26:01.199]  We have this atrocity going on in the Gulf of Mexico.
[03:26:01.199 --> 03:26:03.962]  How about a real alternative energy?
[03:26:03.962 --> 03:26:11.949]  We spent $22 billion in today's currency to develop the atom bomb.
[03:26:12.469 --> 03:26:14.770]  And Bill Los Alamos.
[03:26:14.770 --> 03:26:25.817]  If they were putting the energy and intelligence into having an alternative energy, that could be the kind of... Well, Gerald, it's like Riders of the Lost Ark, as you know.
[03:26:25.817 --> 03:26:27.457]  They've got warehouses full of it.
[03:26:27.457 --> 03:26:38.804]  I... MIT, a decade ago, developed a type of cheap solar panel that's just metal that could produce enough power to power every home, you name it, and the World Bank bought it
[03:26:39.344 --> 03:26:42.366]  Even though taxpayers paid for it and isn't letting anybody have it.
[03:26:42.366 --> 03:26:43.626]  It is a fact.
[03:26:43.626 --> 03:26:48.989]  They are suppressing, as you know, just the Valhalla of energy.
[03:26:48.989 --> 03:26:51.610]  Because they want us dependent on them.
[03:26:51.610 --> 03:26:52.370]  Exactly.
[03:26:52.370 --> 03:26:57.273]  And the other point is, look what got us out of the 1990s recession.
[03:26:57.273 --> 03:26:57.833]  It's simple.
[03:26:57.833 --> 03:27:00.514]  It was a productive capacity.
[03:27:00.514 --> 03:27:01.915]  The internet revolution.
[03:27:01.915 --> 03:27:03.696]  I mean, here we are on Skype.
[03:27:03.696 --> 03:27:06.317]  Look at how the world changed since the mid-1990s.
[03:27:08.158 --> 03:27:11.519]  Products were invented, designed, manufactured.
[03:27:11.519 --> 03:27:20.941]  And now with cyber security, they say every IT person will be government certified, the entire internet and all computers will be under government certification for what you can build.
[03:27:20.941 --> 03:27:22.861]  They're creating a new dark age there!
[03:27:22.861 --> 03:27:27.802]  They've taken over health care, they're taking over the ranches, the farms, they're taking over the Amish.
[03:27:27.802 --> 03:27:30.303]  These people are a bunch of crooks!
[03:27:30.303 --> 03:27:31.823]  No they're not, they're fascists.
[03:27:32.833 --> 03:27:34.234]  They're fascist crooks!
[03:27:34.234 --> 03:27:35.135]  No, I agree with you.
[03:27:35.135 --> 03:27:36.576]  It's just unspeakable.
[03:27:36.576 --> 03:27:37.737]  Let's jam in one more call.
[03:27:37.737 --> 03:27:39.298]  This is just incredible.
[03:27:39.298 --> 03:27:40.319]  George in Connecticut.
[03:27:40.319 --> 03:27:40.919]  You're on the air.
[03:27:40.919 --> 03:27:43.802]  Hi, Gerald.
[03:27:43.802 --> 03:27:45.503]  I think an idea I've had.
[03:27:45.503 --> 03:27:54.610]  Why don't we have a simulcast of all the free thinkers like Alex and Gary Knoll that you've been on.
[03:27:54.610 --> 03:27:58.313]  The guys that are growing an audience and that also have an idea.
[03:27:58.840 --> 03:28:07.229]  Can you also give us the best battle plans to bring down these bankers and basically short-circuit this possible war they want to have?
[03:28:07.229 --> 03:28:09.492]  Well, I'll tell you what I'm going to do because we're almost out of time.
[03:28:09.492 --> 03:28:15.558]  Gerald, I know I'm twisting your arm here, but can we go to break and come back with just five minutes without calls so you can cover solutions?
[03:28:15.558 --> 03:28:18.562]  Because I keep getting emails and calls off air saying solutions.
[03:28:19.162 --> 03:28:19.322]  Sure.
[03:28:19.322 --> 03:28:26.806]  Hey, I'd just like to ask Gerald what he thinks about BP and Goldman Sachs selling their shares during this slower part of the year, and also if he thinks this Guantanamo Bay will finally be moved if Cuba is covered in oil.
[03:28:26.806 --> 03:28:28.366]  And thanks for taking my call.
[03:28:48.894 --> 03:28:52.656]  You know, that BP issue is very, very significant.
[03:28:52.656 --> 03:29:06.661]  And, you know, I don't believe this guy Tony Hayward, the president, that little slimy cat out there, has sold, what, a couple of hundred thousand shares just before all this happened.
[03:29:06.661 --> 03:29:08.882]  Yeah, he sold 35% of his stock days before.
[03:29:08.882 --> 03:29:10.163]  Goldman Sachs sold 44% of his.
[03:29:10.163 --> 03:29:11.443]  A record sale.
[03:29:11.443 --> 03:29:12.564]  It's still coincidental.
[03:29:12.904 --> 03:29:15.526]  Nobody's that great a speculator.
[03:29:15.526 --> 03:29:17.708]  And the other... I mean, did you hear this guy?
[03:29:17.708 --> 03:29:20.730]  VP will make it right, will fix it.
[03:29:20.730 --> 03:29:22.491]  Who are they kidding with this stuff?
[03:29:22.491 --> 03:29:24.833]  No, it's an inside job at some level.
[03:29:24.833 --> 03:29:26.534]  It's all an inside job.
[03:29:26.534 --> 03:29:32.899]  The only way you make hundreds of millions of dollars is being on the inside and knowing how the game is rigged.
[03:29:33.579 --> 03:29:34.960]  So that's the way I see it.
[03:29:34.960 --> 03:29:35.780]  Well said.
[03:29:35.780 --> 03:29:36.641]  Absolutely.
[03:29:36.641 --> 03:29:39.203]  I mean, the way they want anybody to fix it.
[03:29:39.203 --> 03:29:44.726]  Obama wants to get his carbon tax now and saying, oh, it's a tax to clean up the Gulf.
[03:29:44.726 --> 03:29:45.847]  Total baloney.
[03:29:45.847 --> 03:29:48.669]  We'll be back with Gerald Salenta to get some final solution points from him.
[03:29:48.669 --> 03:29:51.551]  Stay with us.
[03:29:51.551 --> 03:29:52.951]  We're on the march.
[03:29:52.951 --> 03:29:55.473]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.473 --> 03:29:58.155]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.782 --> 03:30:04.983]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[03:30:04.983 --> 03:30:11.384]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[03:30:11.384 --> 03:30:18.765]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[03:30:18.765 --> 03:30:23.646]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[03:30:23.646 --> 03:30:25.767]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[03:30:28.587 --> 03:30:32.348]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[03:30:32.348 --> 03:30:34.629]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[03:30:34.629 --> 03:30:34.949]  Call us!
[03:30:48.032 --> 03:30:48.573]  We're good to go.
[03:31:04.648 --> 03:31:05.909]  Tyranny is here.
[03:31:05.909 --> 03:31:09.652]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:31:09.652 --> 03:31:12.074]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:31:12.074 --> 03:31:17.958]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:31:17.958 --> 03:31:24.203]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:31:24.603 --> 03:31:30.588]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:31:30.588 --> 03:31:34.771]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[03:31:34.771 --> 03:31:39.055]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:31:39.055 --> 03:31:45.000]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:31:45.000 --> 03:31:48.563]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:31:48.563 --> 03:31:50.544]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:31:50.544 --> 03:31:50.985]  It's here.

[03:33:00.460 --> 03:33:00.793]  The threes.
[03:33:04.736 --> 03:33:06.837]  All right, it's our final segment with our guest.
[03:33:06.837 --> 03:33:10.160]  I'll continue with calls and other news at the end of the broadcast.
[03:33:10.160 --> 03:33:14.723]  It's only AM and FM dial, XM, Global Shortwave, and other satellite systems.
[03:33:14.723 --> 03:33:34.356]  But I'm going to do at least 20, 30 minutes into overdrive today on several key subjects like MSNBC hit piece, Smear's Tea Party as Neo-Nazis, and how that dovetails with the Washington Post, the New York Times, Atlantic Monthly, and at least three other publications yesterday.
[03:33:35.336 --> 03:33:40.760]  That came out and basically demonized me and implied that I'm dangerous.
[03:33:40.760 --> 03:33:45.403]  We never talk about violence, we never talk about killing people, unless it's in self-defense.
[03:33:45.403 --> 03:33:52.047]  You know, I say, if somebody breaks into my house, you better, you know, get ready to die, you know, with some crook or whatever.
[03:33:52.047 --> 03:33:57.811]  And they are just, they are coming after me big time, and believe me, a lot of people are like, man, that's great, that's great for your ego.
[03:33:57.811 --> 03:33:59.732]  No, no, it's not great, okay?
[03:33:59.732 --> 03:34:02.194]  What's great is beating these people.
[03:34:02.694 --> 03:34:05.257]  I'm doing this because I don't want to be a slave.
[03:34:05.257 --> 03:34:08.199]  I'm fundamentally angry about being enslaved.
[03:34:08.199 --> 03:34:09.881]  Okay, folks?
[03:34:09.881 --> 03:34:12.043]  This isn't about being a little media whore.
[03:34:12.043 --> 03:34:12.583]  Okay?
[03:34:12.583 --> 03:34:17.248]  This is dangerous for what we're doing, and Gerald Solente's got a lot of courage as well.
[03:34:18.689 --> 03:34:21.150]  Gerald, again, they're really taking the gloves off.
[03:34:21.150 --> 03:34:33.155]  What do you expect them to try against us in the future, A, and then B, what are some basic solutions to not just protect ourselves individually, but turn the tables on them and take things back at the state level?
[03:34:33.155 --> 03:34:44.259]  How do you expect the Tea Parties, as you said three years ago, that you predicted, you have a second American Revolution, you call them tax protest groups, how do you see them morphing to the next level that you predicted?
[03:34:46.066 --> 03:34:50.107]  On the first level, when they lose control, they attack.
[03:34:50.107 --> 03:34:51.868]  And that's what the media is doing.
[03:34:51.868 --> 03:34:58.910]  People are reading less and less of those publications and watching less of those news broadcasts that you mentioned.
[03:34:58.910 --> 03:35:04.691]  So anytime, you know, they're going to do anything they can to discredit those that aren't members of the club.
[03:35:04.691 --> 03:35:06.852]  The Tea Parties are only the first step.
[03:35:07.572 --> 03:35:11.113]  And we see it going into something greater and more inclusive.
[03:35:11.113 --> 03:35:17.175]  They will demonize anything they possibly can, but it'll be unsuccessful in the long term.
[03:35:17.175 --> 03:35:25.737]  Again, you pointed out, as we saw, Sarah Palin has put her imprimatur on it, and others, these talk show hosts.
[03:35:25.737 --> 03:35:31.179]  So they're trying to hijack the Tea Party, so therefore they're trying to demonize it in some levels.
[03:35:31.179 --> 03:35:33.159]  But that's just the beginning.
[03:35:33.159 --> 03:35:35.240]  The other question about the solutions.
[03:35:37.341 --> 03:35:56.956]  It makes news when these politicians show up somewhere and all of a sudden they start getting drowned out by crowds, just like Pom Pom Pelosi did yesterday as she was shouted down for the continuation of the wars and all the other backtracking that she's done.
[03:35:56.956 --> 03:35:59.037]  People have to get involved.
[03:35:59.037 --> 03:36:01.059]  And it all starts within.
[03:36:01.059 --> 03:36:05.022]  And this isn't spiritual, you know, mumbo jumbo.
[03:36:05.022 --> 03:36:05.803]  It's a fact.
[03:36:06.463 --> 03:36:13.527]  If you want, there's an old saying, when the people are ready, the leader arrives.
[03:36:13.527 --> 03:36:15.868]  People have to start engaging.
[03:36:15.868 --> 03:36:22.391]  They have to get in shape, physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
[03:36:22.391 --> 03:36:25.053]  We cannot go on the way we are.
[03:36:25.053 --> 03:36:34.498]  We're looking at a country that, of the people over 50, we're looking at 40% of them becoming obese and try to achieve anything great.
[03:36:34.898 --> 03:36:38.181]  We have to get in shape in every way we can.
[03:36:38.181 --> 03:36:43.346]  You know this John Woodner just died, that great basketball coach from UCLA.
[03:36:43.346 --> 03:36:49.732]  I was reading his obituary and he used to carry this little sheet of paper around and one of the things that it said on it
[03:36:50.453 --> 03:36:53.657]  Create a masterpiece every day.
[03:36:53.657 --> 03:36:56.921]  Think in those terms of the greatness that you could achieve.
[03:36:56.921 --> 03:37:00.324]  Don't get dragged down by everybody else's trip.
[03:37:00.324 --> 03:37:05.090]  And as we as a nation to do it in a practical manner.
[03:37:06.415 --> 03:37:09.639]  I don't buy anything from China.
[03:37:26.738 --> 03:37:51.352]  He built his own telescopes out of old tractor parts in mirrors, impressed the local observatory, would come in there on the weekends and clean it and polish the equipment for free when he was like 17, 18 years old, and then on his own would take these high-tech systems of the day that the observatory didn't even know how to properly use and take photographs at night and then overlay them, and on his own found Pluto,
[03:37:51.732 --> 03:37:53.553]  When he was like 20 years old.
[03:37:53.553 --> 03:37:57.716]  That's what made America great with almost all the inventions and everything else.
[03:37:57.716 --> 03:38:01.998]  You know, he wasn't 18 years old, you know, out there getting drunk acting like an idiot.
[03:38:01.998 --> 03:38:04.320]  He was out there finding Pluto.
[03:38:04.320 --> 03:38:08.603]  I'm sorry to digress, but there were so many Americans like that.
[03:38:08.603 --> 03:38:12.245]  How do we go from that to the jellyfish so many people are today?
[03:38:12.875 --> 03:38:18.279]  Well, again, the change has already happened, and it's happening with the Tea Parties.
[03:38:18.279 --> 03:38:27.304]  So, anybody that says that the future is predetermined is trying to rob you of your dignity and the soul within you.
[03:38:27.304 --> 03:38:38.312]  We create the future, and we could have an America far greater than we could ever imagine if people engaged into it in a moral way.
[03:38:38.912 --> 03:38:43.335]  Not by violence or guns, but by minds and intellect.
[03:38:43.335 --> 03:38:46.857]  And again, on a simple level, it's summertime.
[03:38:46.857 --> 03:38:49.019]  Grow as much as you can.
[03:38:49.019 --> 03:38:58.705]  Rip up those lawns that you're dumping chemicals on to grow grass that you can't eat or smoke and do something productive on it.
[03:38:58.705 --> 03:39:01.747]  Support your local go-to-the-farmers markets.
[03:39:01.747 --> 03:39:03.248]  They're all over the place.
[03:39:03.988 --> 03:39:07.593]  Become involved on the local level.
[03:39:07.593 --> 03:39:17.306]  Not as a politico, but somebody that becomes involved to know what's going on, so that you can direct it in the manner that you believe.
[03:39:17.306 --> 03:39:18.849]  Teach your children!
[03:39:19.369 --> 03:39:26.216]  Teach your children to be honest at every possible level and to do business cleanly.
[03:39:26.216 --> 03:39:27.777]  So those are the things that we could do.
[03:39:27.777 --> 03:39:32.161]  And again, as I was mentioning, I don't buy anything from China, I don't have to.
[03:39:32.161 --> 03:39:36.525]  Unfortunately, we have to buy electronic equipment because most of it's made there.
[03:39:36.525 --> 03:39:40.969]  But anything else, I'll go into a store, I look at the bottom, I believe in the golden rule.
[03:39:41.590 --> 03:39:42.591]  Both of them.
[03:39:42.591 --> 03:39:47.417]  Do unto others as you would have them do unto you and those that have the gold rule.
[03:39:47.417 --> 03:39:50.121]  And I don't want to be ruled by the Chinese.
[03:39:50.121 --> 03:39:53.525]  So we need to do business with each other.
[03:39:53.525 --> 03:39:55.548]  I come up with a little... Gandhi.
[03:39:57.233 --> 03:40:03.518]  Gandhi brought down the English Empire when they controlled India.
[03:40:03.518 --> 03:40:05.239]  How did he do it?
[03:40:05.239 --> 03:40:09.703]  He told the people, don't buy anything from them.
[03:40:09.703 --> 03:40:11.284]  Make your own.
[03:40:11.284 --> 03:40:17.049]  And there's a movement going on right now in India that has that same message.
[03:40:17.049 --> 03:40:18.310]  Drink Indian.
[03:40:18.310 --> 03:40:19.451]  Eat Indian.
[03:40:19.451 --> 03:40:19.991]  Buy Indian.
[03:40:21.172 --> 03:40:25.714]  Buy U.S., drink U.S., support local.
[03:40:25.714 --> 03:40:29.076]  We can do it if we bring it all back.
[03:40:29.076 --> 03:40:42.542]  The people that's saying that we can't manufacture, we can't build our way out of this, have become the corporate slaves that don't have it within them the courage or the dignity to make that happen.
[03:40:42.542 --> 03:40:50.106]  I believe we could become an America far greater than we could ever imagine if we go back to what made us great before.
[03:40:51.224 --> 03:40:51.744]  Absolutely.
[03:40:51.744 --> 03:40:52.965]  You mentioned the electronics.
[03:40:52.965 --> 03:40:55.606]  I try to buy American, or at least Canadian or Mexican.
[03:40:55.606 --> 03:40:57.787]  At least there's some trade between us.
[03:40:57.787 --> 03:40:59.268]  And I never go in Walmart.
[03:40:59.268 --> 03:41:00.909]  I hardly ever go in Target.
[03:41:00.909 --> 03:41:05.631]  And I never buy things I don't need that are made overseas.
[03:41:05.631 --> 03:41:13.375]  But at the same time, we're coming out with these little flash drives that have Infoworks.com on them, because people keep requesting them.
[03:41:13.375 --> 03:41:15.697]  So what gets requested, we add to the store.
[03:41:16.878 --> 03:41:20.122]  And you cannot buy flash drives made in America.
[03:41:20.122 --> 03:41:25.228]  Now, we are getting the InfoWars printed in America, and guess what?
[03:41:25.228 --> 03:41:28.232]  That costs twice as much as it does to have it done in China.
[03:41:28.232 --> 03:41:35.180]  So, these things are gonna cost a couple dollars more than a flash drive at the store, because the InfoWars.com
[03:41:36.602 --> 03:41:38.063]  Is printed in America.
[03:41:38.063 --> 03:41:43.285]  And so, I mean, you cannot find them made in America.
[03:41:43.285 --> 03:41:48.666]  What is, I mean, we have a sponsor, Diamond Gusset Jeans, made in Tennessee and Georgia.
[03:41:48.666 --> 03:41:53.268]  You know, and they cost a few bucks more because there's higher taxes, regulations, but they're a lot better jeans.
[03:41:53.268 --> 03:41:55.149]  You know, we have to make the decision.
[03:41:56.308 --> 03:41:56.849]  That's right.
[03:41:56.849 --> 03:42:01.593]  We have to make the decision and we have to make it in the USA.
[03:42:01.593 --> 03:42:04.255]  And until we do that, we're doomed.
[03:42:04.255 --> 03:42:11.602]  We cannot survive by becoming a service sector society and consuming more than we produce.
[03:42:11.602 --> 03:42:13.024]  It's impossible.
[03:42:13.024 --> 03:42:15.146]  So it can be reversed.
[03:42:15.146 --> 03:42:18.309]  And again, you know, I don't eat corporate food.
[03:42:18.309 --> 03:42:19.069]  I'm Italian.
[03:42:19.069 --> 03:42:19.910]  I know a good food.
[03:42:19.910 --> 03:42:20.491]  I don't do that, Jim.
[03:42:21.912 --> 03:42:23.613]  I don't go into Walmart.
[03:42:23.613 --> 03:42:25.915]  I go into Walmart just to do research.
[03:42:25.915 --> 03:42:29.819]  It's like going into a large self-storage unit.
[03:42:29.819 --> 03:42:33.682]  So we have to get back to the quality that this country used to have.
[03:42:33.682 --> 03:42:37.365]  And what we have in the Trends Journal, when you talk about solutions,
[03:42:38.106 --> 03:42:40.727]  It's called the 20% solution.
[03:42:40.727 --> 03:42:46.470]  If 20% of the people go into a new direction, the rest will follow.
[03:42:46.470 --> 03:42:49.472]  The sheeple will go in any direction you want.
[03:42:49.472 --> 03:42:55.415]  And I believe there are 20% of the people out there that want the country to go into that direction.
[03:42:55.415 --> 03:42:57.316]  That can stop wars.
[03:42:57.316 --> 03:43:00.617]  That can stop us going on the path that we're on.
[03:43:00.617 --> 03:43:03.459]  If they stand up, regain their courage and their dignity.
[03:43:04.193 --> 03:43:04.814]  Absolutely.
[03:43:04.814 --> 03:43:06.657]  Gerald Cilente, we're going to let you go.
[03:43:06.657 --> 03:43:14.969]  Briefly, tell folks what is in this month's key TrendsResearch.com journal and how folks get a digital or hard copy.
[03:43:14.969 --> 03:43:19.876]  Well, they could go to our website TrendsResearch.com or TrendsJournal.com.
[03:43:20.777 --> 03:43:32.341]  And what we're working on now in the upcoming summer issue that'll be out in several weeks, mid-July latest, is really how to survive and thrive in these coming times.
[03:43:32.341 --> 03:43:36.663]  And among the things to do, and I don't give financial advice, I'm telling you what I do,
[03:43:37.623 --> 03:43:40.865]  I have 80% of my money in gold.
[03:43:40.865 --> 03:43:44.747]  I used to have my cash split between dollars and euros.
[03:43:44.747 --> 03:43:50.310]  Now it's split between dollars, francs, Swiss francs, and Canadian dollars.
[03:43:50.310 --> 03:43:57.094]  All I want to do in this time with my cash and investments is not to lose it.
[03:43:57.094 --> 03:43:59.235]  Gold is my wild card.
[03:43:59.235 --> 03:44:01.216]  I believe that gold is going to go to $2,000 an ounce.
[03:44:01.216 --> 03:44:02.617]  This year, it looks like $1,500 an ounce.
[03:44:06.459 --> 03:44:08.100]  Well, that's what Mark Twain said.
[03:44:08.100 --> 03:44:08.960]  That's what Mark Twain said.
[03:44:08.960 --> 03:44:12.201]  He said, I don't care about the return on my money.
[03:44:12.201 --> 03:44:14.362]  All I want is the return of my money.
[03:44:14.362 --> 03:44:16.083]  When speaking of banking.
[03:44:16.083 --> 03:44:17.944]  Yeah, and that's exactly it.
[03:44:17.944 --> 03:44:19.184]  And people started.
[03:44:19.184 --> 03:44:24.346]  We really believe they should start preparing for the worst to come.
[03:44:24.346 --> 03:44:29.568]  If you if the worst doesn't come and you made provisions, you've lost nothing.
[03:44:29.568 --> 03:44:35.751]  If the worst happens as we see it happening and you've made no provisions, then you lose everything.
[03:44:35.911 --> 03:44:37.572]  Well, in closing, I want to just say this.
[03:44:37.572 --> 03:44:38.573]  It's already happened.
[03:44:38.573 --> 03:44:49.122]  The media is lying about jobs, but even with Cook numbers, 95% are government, with them firing and rehiring the census people every month, on record.
[03:44:49.122 --> 03:44:51.003]  Stores are shutting down everywhere.
[03:44:51.003 --> 03:44:53.805]  All I hear is debt ads on the radio.
[03:44:53.805 --> 03:44:56.527]  All I see is more homeless people everywhere.
[03:44:56.527 --> 03:44:57.968]  Mexico's fully collapsed.
[03:44:58.709 --> 03:45:06.531]  They're laying off police and firemen and essential services everywhere, but the taxes are going up on interest of the bankers.
[03:45:06.531 --> 03:45:09.691]  I mean, we've got a default on all this fraudulent stuff or it's over.
[03:45:09.691 --> 03:45:11.392]  So your predictions came true, Gerald.
[03:45:11.392 --> 03:45:13.032]  My predictions came true.
[03:45:13.032 --> 03:45:18.533]  It's just unfortunately your prediction of the greatest depression now looks like a certainty.
[03:45:18.533 --> 03:45:23.494]  And so we're going from trying to stop the bankers from ruining us to now trying to just
[03:45:23.954 --> 03:45:24.775]  Hey, thank you Alex.
[03:45:48.055 --> 03:45:51.956]  She's just like, we need to sell this house and get to the country.
[03:45:51.956 --> 03:45:56.218]  And I'm like, well, honey, I can't commute an hour and a half into the office.
[03:45:56.218 --> 03:46:02.040]  I mean, it is, but it's becoming the point of, it's not a luxury to live in the country.
[03:46:02.040 --> 03:46:06.942]  It's a necessity, but I've got a big crew here and people I've got to direct and work.
[03:46:06.942 --> 03:46:07.502]  I've got to do it.
[03:46:07.502 --> 03:46:10.663]  I'm 30 minutes already from my office at 25 minutes.
[03:46:10.663 --> 03:46:15.545]  But I mean, I don't want to be in the city when all the, all hell breaks loose.
[03:46:15.545 --> 03:46:15.605]  Um,
[03:46:17.403 --> 03:46:18.404]  I don't know what I'm going to do.
[03:46:18.404 --> 03:46:22.166]  I mean, it's like, I know intellectually that I'm right.
[03:46:22.166 --> 03:46:24.368]  I don't get up here and say things I don't think are true.
[03:46:24.368 --> 03:46:32.374]  People like 10 years ago, Alex says they're going to sell derivatives and have a global financial meltdown and set up a bank of the world and a global carbon tax.
[03:46:32.374 --> 03:46:33.975]  That guy's a lunatic!
[03:46:33.975 --> 03:46:41.660]  I was reading you in Club of Rome Trilateral Commission documents.
[03:46:41.660 --> 03:46:45.183]  I mean, this is not me sitting here predicting the future.
[03:46:46.252 --> 03:46:47.312]  Okay?
[03:46:47.312 --> 03:46:48.953]  I mean, this is what these people do.
[03:46:48.953 --> 03:46:51.314]  It's what they've done in third world countries over and over again.
[03:46:51.314 --> 03:46:56.796]  Gerald's been able to predict the future by exactly when it's going to happen by tracking their criminal activities.
[03:46:56.796 --> 03:46:58.276]  I just knew they were training the military.
[03:46:58.276 --> 03:47:00.377]  Listen, let me tell you something.
[03:47:00.377 --> 03:47:04.338]  Thirteen years ago, I went to my first urban warfare drill and witnessed U.S.
[03:47:04.338 --> 03:47:09.100]  Marines with foreign troops training to take Americans' guns and admitting it was for America.
[03:47:09.980 --> 03:47:17.766]  And I went on the air and I said, I don't know if they're going to try it this year or ten years from now, but they are training our military for martial law.
[03:47:17.766 --> 03:47:22.550]  We've got a problem, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:47:22.550 --> 03:47:26.774]  And then I read what the big central banks had done all over the world.
[03:47:26.774 --> 03:47:34.500]  I read and researched what they'd done over and over again, and these people are obsessive-compulsive.
[03:47:34.500 --> 03:47:35.081]  They are
[03:47:38.956 --> 03:47:39.877]  Creatures of habit.
[03:47:39.877 --> 03:47:43.018]  I'm trying to think of the proper word for it.
[03:47:43.018 --> 03:47:44.399]  They're pathological.
[03:47:44.399 --> 03:47:49.142]  They just do it over and over and over and over and over.
[03:47:49.142 --> 03:47:50.883]  I mean, we know how they break up families.
[03:47:50.883 --> 03:47:52.083]  We know how they put in surveillance.
[03:47:52.083 --> 03:47:53.964]  We know how they federalize police.
[03:47:53.964 --> 03:47:56.106]  We know how they shut up FEMA centers.
[03:47:56.106 --> 03:47:58.427]  We know how they collapse societies as their cover.
[03:47:58.427 --> 03:47:59.848]  We know how they launch wars.
[03:47:59.848 --> 03:48:02.469]  We know what they do.
[03:48:02.469 --> 03:48:07.112]  You know, I get intel in January of last year, 18 months ago or more,
[03:48:08.160 --> 03:48:17.230]  Now, and I get emergency managers on, and I get the actual documents, and I call the phone numbers, and the Bureau of Cemeteries asks me, how did you get this in New York?
[03:48:17.230 --> 03:48:21.255]  And they get hopping mad and say, hold on, I'm calling the police, you're not supposed to have that.
[03:48:21.255 --> 03:48:24.158]  You know, I found out it was real!
[03:48:24.158 --> 03:48:27.141]  That they were going to launch some type of flu hysteria!
[03:48:27.141 --> 03:48:28.383]  I knew three months before!
[03:48:31.343 --> 03:48:36.526]  But we were able to get the jump on them, and so record numbers didn't take it, and they weren't able to go to full martial law.
[03:48:36.526 --> 03:48:50.234]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, do you know what it's like to have the responsibility to know, in the aggregate, hundreds of millions of people listen to me on a month-to-month, year-to-year basis, and that this is life and death, this isn't a game!
[03:48:50.234 --> 03:48:52.375]  The FEMA camps aren't a game!
[03:48:52.375 --> 03:48:55.337]  The cancer viruses and the vaccines aren't a game!
[03:48:55.337 --> 03:49:00.120]  The sodium fluoride in the water that literally attacks every organ in your body isn't a game!
[03:49:01.288 --> 03:49:17.401]  And then I see a show on Cartoon Network like Squidbillies where they're ignorant, you know, it's always okay to have a stereotype of Southerners as a bunch of scum, racist, filth morons who think fluoride is gonna attack their testicles and sterilize them.
[03:49:17.401 --> 03:49:19.683]  That's actually what it does!
[03:49:19.683 --> 03:49:23.166]  I can pull up, in fact, I meant to go over this with a piece.
[03:49:23.166 --> 03:49:25.888]  I meant to play the Squidbillies when we go into overdrive.
[03:49:28.074 --> 03:49:39.456]  But I had a folder with Aaron the other day, because I was going to do this then and I didn't do it, that had all the EPA admissions that it sterilizes you and the articles about how it causes cancer.
[03:49:39.456 --> 03:49:42.057]  Hey, will you call Aaron in here real fast?
[03:49:42.057 --> 03:49:47.037]  Because I can have him, by the time the official show ends, he can print thousands of these.
[03:49:47.037 --> 03:49:54.039]  Government studies, you know, photos of the rat's testicles shriveled up to nothing after one part per million fluoride for a few months.
[03:49:56.044 --> 03:50:00.948]  I mean it's just, it's unbelievable.
[03:50:00.948 --> 03:50:06.051]  So I wanted to play this squid bellies thing, but I may not have time to do that.
[03:50:06.051 --> 03:50:06.592]  Is he down there?
[03:50:09.787 --> 03:50:10.547]  He's coming in now.
[03:50:10.547 --> 03:50:21.690]  Hey, hey, Aaron, I had meant to go into overdrive when I cover Chris Matthews' demonization, how he got his script, and how I was also going to hit some other From News, who now admits he attends Bilderberg.
[03:50:21.690 --> 03:50:26.972]  He's been writing demonization pieces on Ron Paul, myself, Rand Paul, and now he admits he's a New World Order guy.
[03:50:26.972 --> 03:50:29.632]  Wrote a story about himself in the National Post of Canada.
[03:50:29.632 --> 03:50:31.733]  Of course, he came up with acts as an evil term.
[03:50:33.234 --> 03:50:37.697]  Can you go just print me a couple mainstream articles about fluoride doubling cancer?
[03:50:37.697 --> 03:50:39.258]  Some will say four times.
[03:50:39.258 --> 03:50:45.582]  And, uh, that, uh, majority of EPA scientists sent the letter to the EPA saying it's dangerous.
[03:50:45.582 --> 03:50:48.064]  Like, EPA toxicologists say remove fluoride.
[03:50:48.064 --> 03:50:51.826]  And print me one about America Dental Association says don't brush your teeth with fluoride.
[03:50:51.826 --> 03:50:52.747]  Uh, just get me those.
[03:50:52.747 --> 03:50:53.828]  I want to do the squid billies.
[03:50:53.828 --> 03:50:59.391]  I want to play it and then show people the actual documents and say, see, they want you to chemically kill yourself.
[03:50:59.391 --> 03:51:00.412]  This is real.
[03:51:00.412 --> 03:51:01.833]  And they got children's shows saying it's good.
[03:51:03.394 --> 03:51:03.895]  We're good to go.
[03:51:21.015 --> 03:51:21.555]  I think so.

[03:52:06.913 --> 03:52:10.558]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:52:10.558 --> 03:52:13.081]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:52:13.081 --> 03:52:18.509]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.

[03:52:25.618 --> 03:52:31.567]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:52:31.567 --> 03:52:35.312]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.

[03:52:51.520 --> 03:52:52.640]  It's here.

[03:54:52.736 --> 03:54:53.757]  We go into overdrive, 888-201-2244.
[03:54:53.757 --> 03:54:53.837]  888-201-2244.
[03:54:53.837 --> 03:54:54.677]  Again, 888-201-2244.
[03:54:54.677 --> 03:54:56.138]  We're going to do 30 minutes of overdrive.
[03:55:04.227 --> 03:55:06.929]  Only for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.

[03:55:32.381 --> 03:55:37.924]  A lot of different ways for people to listen on the internet, but the best way is PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:55:37.924 --> 03:55:43.306]  But first, I'm going to get into InfoWars.com receives Rise of the New Right script.
[03:55:43.306 --> 03:55:51.230]  Worse than we thought from Chris, the deceptive Slimeball Matthews of Slimeball, one of the most unpopular shows on television.
[03:55:51.230 --> 03:55:52.951]  He has about the same listening audience as
[03:55:54.400 --> 03:55:58.664]  Maybe a regional popular show on the radio saying Chicago.
[03:55:58.664 --> 03:56:01.247]  I mean the guy is literally a joke.
[03:56:01.247 --> 03:56:06.872]  There are many rock and roll morning shows in big cities that have bigger audiences than Chris Matthews.
[03:56:06.872 --> 03:56:09.255]  He is a fraud.
[03:56:09.255 --> 03:56:09.875]  Remember that.
[03:56:09.875 --> 03:56:11.777]  It's all the great Oz.
[03:56:11.777 --> 03:56:12.858]  Little man behind the curtain.
[03:56:13.559 --> 03:56:17.861]  He has literally a little demonic hunchback spiritually behind the curtain.
[03:56:17.861 --> 03:56:22.404]  And then he's got this big, I am the mighty Oz!
[03:56:22.404 --> 03:56:24.205]  I am huge!
[03:56:24.205 --> 03:56:26.026]  I control reality!
[03:56:26.026 --> 03:56:30.228]  I say you are a racist!
[03:56:30.228 --> 03:56:36.071]  I say you are the new Nazis because you don't want to be my slave!
[03:56:36.071 --> 03:56:38.693]  I am the great mainstream media!
[03:56:39.053 --> 03:56:39.994]  He's like, oh my god!
[03:56:39.994 --> 03:56:41.354]  No one's listening to us!
[03:56:41.354 --> 03:56:43.095]  Government, shut down the alternative media!
[03:56:43.095 --> 03:56:43.635]  They're bigger!
[03:56:43.635 --> 03:56:45.897]  They're much bigger than I am!
[03:56:45.897 --> 03:56:49.359]  Shut down the Drudge Report!
[03:56:49.359 --> 03:56:51.059]  Let me get back up there and scare them!
[03:56:51.059 --> 03:56:58.824]  I am the great and powerful Chris Matthews!
[03:56:58.824 --> 03:57:00.585]  That has 500,000 viewers!
[03:57:00.585 --> 03:57:03.366]  I am the great one!
[03:57:03.366 --> 03:57:05.647]  I am the great one!
[03:57:05.647 --> 03:57:06.048]  I!
[03:57:06.048 --> 03:57:06.548]  I!
[03:57:06.548 --> 03:57:08.249]  CNN losing half its viewers in the last year?
[03:57:10.370 --> 03:57:10.730]  All of you!
[03:57:10.730 --> 03:57:13.393]  You're all a joke!
[03:57:13.393 --> 03:57:14.394]  And you know why you're a joke?
[03:57:14.394 --> 03:57:17.837]  You say if people don't like healthcare, it's because they don't like black people.
[03:57:17.837 --> 03:57:18.317]  Come on.
[03:57:18.317 --> 03:57:19.718]  Keep saying stuff like that.
[03:57:19.718 --> 03:57:20.999]  Please keep it up.
[03:57:20.999 --> 03:57:25.323]  You are doing a fabulous job totally discrediting yourselves.
[03:57:25.323 --> 03:57:26.404]  Even off your teleprompters.
[03:57:26.404 --> 03:57:27.465]  Everybody knows you're liars.
[03:57:27.465 --> 03:57:28.826]  There's no teleprompter here, Mac.
[03:57:28.826 --> 03:57:29.307]  I'm real.
[03:57:29.787 --> 03:57:30.868]  I'm a real American.
[03:57:30.868 --> 03:57:32.069]  I really do research.
[03:57:32.069 --> 03:57:33.750]  I really know what I'm talking about.
[03:57:33.750 --> 03:57:35.050]  I really know history.
[03:57:35.050 --> 03:57:38.833]  Unlike Matthews, who does these little history tricks with people, tries to catch them unaware.
[03:57:38.833 --> 03:57:41.214]  So have your fun with your piece.
[03:57:41.214 --> 03:57:42.335]  Twist what I said.
[03:57:42.335 --> 03:57:43.095]  Distort it all.
[03:57:43.095 --> 03:57:44.737]  We've got the script.
[03:57:44.737 --> 03:57:45.377]  I love it.
[03:57:45.377 --> 03:57:47.698]  Everybody knows your tricks.
[03:57:47.698 --> 03:57:52.601]  What, you may have 5% of the public, fluoride heads, who can't even hardly tie their shoelaces, that like you?
[03:57:52.601 --> 03:57:53.422]  Great!
[03:57:53.422 --> 03:57:54.583]  You can have those people.
[03:57:55.143 --> 03:57:56.263]  You can have them!
[03:57:56.263 --> 03:57:58.444]  Oh, you want to have martial law, don't you, punk?
[03:57:58.444 --> 03:58:00.485]  You want to be able to shut down free speech.
[03:58:00.485 --> 03:58:02.026]  You want to be able to take over the Internet.
[03:58:02.026 --> 03:58:07.908]  You want everybody to still love you and your little globalist, socialist, pencil-necked, fascist takeover garbage.
[03:58:07.908 --> 03:58:09.928]  Well, it ain't working, punk!
[03:58:09.928 --> 03:58:11.249]  It's over, punk, for you!
[03:58:11.909 --> 03:58:15.791]  Everybody knows you and yours ruined this country and flushed it down the toilet.
[03:58:15.791 --> 03:58:20.553]  And you may be successful as you watch America circle the drain laughing and giggling.
[03:58:20.553 --> 03:58:27.675]  You may be successful making it go down the drain, but you are going down the drain with all of us as well.
[03:58:27.675 --> 03:58:29.396]  Remember that scum.
[03:58:29.396 --> 03:58:34.098]  You may be taking us to hell, but in hell, everybody's gonna know who took us to hell.
[03:58:34.098 --> 03:58:37.219]  You little weasel and all the rest of you.
[03:58:37.219 --> 03:58:38.700]  We're going to overdrive right now.

[03:59:36.040 --> 03:59:38.862]  Look for Max the Orange Home Gain Gorilla to help
[03:59:39.122 --> 03:59:44.806]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[04:00:46.845 --> 04:00:48.866]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:00:50.422 --> 04:00:59.125]  Oh look, when I go to the supermarket, I can get HEB Love Baby Purified Water with added fluoride.
[04:00:59.125 --> 04:01:03.067]  And I can get Ozarka Fluoride for kids.
[04:01:03.067 --> 04:01:04.547]  And they've got other brands.
[04:01:04.547 --> 04:01:10.610]  In fact, we can pull up those photos of a school bus with the kids in it, the fluoride they need.
[04:01:10.610 --> 04:01:16.512]  Of course, you read the back of this and it says it can kill you deader than a hammer if you swallow more than a pea size of it.
[04:01:16.512 --> 04:01:18.793]  And of course, the fluoride builds up cumulatively in the body.
[04:01:19.793 --> 04:01:30.201]  I decided to do this overdrive just about 30 minutes ago, and I just called Aaron in here about 10 minutes ago, and I said, hey, I need some documentation on fluoride, because I have it all in my brain, but I'd like to show people.
[04:01:30.201 --> 04:01:31.462]  And this is just what he brought in quickly.
[04:01:31.462 --> 04:01:32.823]  He's going to bring more in.
[04:01:32.823 --> 04:01:36.646]  Fluoride behind high rate of bone cancer in dogs.
[04:01:36.646 --> 04:01:37.487]  Mainstream news.
[04:01:37.487 --> 04:01:40.730]  Second thoughts on fluoride, reports Scientific American.
[04:01:40.730 --> 04:01:44.292]  Fluoride in drinking water may negatively affect health of fetuses and infants.
[04:01:44.292 --> 04:01:46.414]  Major study.
[04:01:46.414 --> 04:01:48.015]  Doubling of bone cancer.
[04:01:49.236 --> 04:01:51.800]  On and on and on with these reports.
[04:01:51.800 --> 04:01:57.769]  Oh, spring water for children with fluoride causes dental fluorosis.
[04:01:59.246 --> 04:02:00.466]  Causes bone fractures.
[04:02:00.466 --> 04:02:02.227]  In fact, I didn't see that in the stack.
[04:02:02.227 --> 04:02:02.907]  Have Aaron print me.
[04:02:02.907 --> 04:02:07.729]  The American Medical Association says do not give fluoride to children under the age of six.
[04:02:07.729 --> 04:02:11.830]  Causes bone fractures, dental fluorosis, and of course all the studies show brain damage.
[04:02:11.830 --> 04:02:13.971]  But I'm going to recap all this.
[04:02:13.971 --> 04:02:17.952]  I'm going to recap all of this coming up.
[04:02:17.952 --> 04:02:22.314]  And a few of the callers that were still on when we ended the official radio show,
[04:02:23.294 --> 04:02:35.780]  About five minutes ago, our welcome to call in at 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244, but just those that were still on hold, because I do want to get to you.
[04:02:35.780 --> 04:02:50.987]  But the reason we had to go into overdrive is there's no way, with all the guests we had on, Gerald Cilente and others, there's no way that I can just end the show and not talk about this, because this is worse than I had first guessed it would be.
[04:02:52.543 --> 04:02:59.429]  I guess it was four or five months ago, Chris Matthews calls up here at the office, Chris Matthews, and then they say, we want to come interview you.
[04:02:59.429 --> 04:03:06.995]  And then he, then they give me his producer and I talked to her and she says, and I said, let me guess, it's a bait and switch to make sure I'll do the interview.
[04:03:06.995 --> 04:03:11.059]  You claim Chris Matthews is coming, but he's going to cancel at the last minute.
[04:03:11.059 --> 04:03:13.040]  She says, I guarantee you he won't.
[04:03:13.040 --> 04:03:16.043]  He's going to be doing town halls in Houston.
[04:03:16.043 --> 04:03:17.324]  He wants to meet with you.
[04:03:17.324 --> 04:03:19.125]  And I said, okay, I'll be friendly.
[04:03:19.125 --> 04:03:19.425]  Bring him.
[04:03:20.430 --> 04:03:23.831]  Less than six hours before he was to be here, they said, oh, he can't come now.
[04:03:23.831 --> 04:03:25.372]  And I said, I expected that.
[04:03:25.372 --> 04:03:35.436]  And I'd also told them on the phone, you will show white supremacist and Hitler, and you will show malicious shooting guns, and then you will cut to me and Rand Paul and Ron Paul.
[04:03:35.436 --> 04:03:40.198]  And they said, no, this is a reasonable view of the Tea Party.
[04:03:40.198 --> 04:03:41.858]  We want to understand you and be friendly.
[04:03:41.858 --> 04:03:43.159]  We want to be friends.
[04:03:43.159 --> 04:03:45.900]  Kind of like Rachel Maddow told Rand Paul before she stabbed him in the back.
[04:03:47.045 --> 04:03:49.846]  And I said, listen, I'm not stupid, just like I told Nightline.
[04:03:49.846 --> 04:03:56.169]  I said, you guys are deceptive, but I said, come on down, bring Matthews, and then he'd check him out.
[04:03:56.169 --> 04:04:06.493]  And when the lady was in studio, she saw a gun over here in my desk, not aimed at her, .357 Magnum revolver, just because it's a reliable gun under stress.
[04:04:06.493 --> 04:04:16.017]  Anybody tries to come in here and do something, we're not gonna just get on our knees and hide under the desk and say, please, please, please, I'm castrated, or, oh, there's a man with a gun!
[04:04:16.357 --> 04:04:17.898]  9-1-1, help me!
[04:04:17.898 --> 04:04:19.380]  Oh, it'll be 12 minutes on average?
[04:04:19.380 --> 04:04:20.661]  Okay, thank you.
[04:04:20.661 --> 04:04:22.203]  No.
[04:04:22.203 --> 04:04:23.404]  No.
[04:04:23.404 --> 04:04:24.184]  Time is of the essence.
[04:04:24.184 --> 04:04:28.228]  That's why I don't have some fancy semi-auto or something or some... No, no, no, no, no.
[04:04:28.228 --> 04:04:31.071]  I just... This is... Pull the trigger, baby.
[04:04:31.071 --> 04:04:37.217]  She saw the gun during the interview and all of a sudden she started crying and I thought I had touched her heart.
[04:04:37.217 --> 04:04:37.757]  This woman was going...
[04:04:41.940 --> 04:04:45.123]  And she got tears in her eyes, and she was an attractive British lady.
[04:04:45.123 --> 04:04:46.184]  And I was like, are you okay?
[04:04:46.184 --> 04:04:50.969]  And she goes, is that a... She was unable to breathe.
[04:04:50.969 --> 04:04:59.457]  She'd been so programmed and so brainwashed, like Freddy Krueger was over her bed at night, she was... Is that a gun?
[04:05:01.334 --> 04:05:02.955]  I actually had a digital recorder recording it all.
[04:05:02.955 --> 04:05:04.855]  I ought to play that.
[04:05:04.855 --> 04:05:06.576]  Heck, where are those recorders?
[04:05:06.576 --> 04:05:07.156]  Did we save that?
[04:05:07.156 --> 04:05:08.717]  Did I have the guys dump that off when they were here?
[04:05:08.717 --> 04:05:10.077]  This is my backup.
[04:05:10.077 --> 04:05:12.458]  We ought to actually find that audio in the next few days and play it.
[04:05:12.458 --> 04:05:14.218]  It's like a three hour interview.
[04:05:14.218 --> 04:05:14.919]  And then get the...
[04:05:16.260 --> 04:05:32.974]  But you can't see, I mean, I was sitting right here, where I'm sitting, she was sitting right here, their camera was over there, they had another camera over here, and I'm talking to her and she sees the gun and starts getting tears in her eyes, and I mean, literally, like she was having a heart attack, and I was like, are you okay, honey?
[04:05:32.974 --> 04:05:37.678]  She said, is that a... You tell, like, she couldn't breathe.
[04:05:37.678 --> 04:05:40.040]  Have you ever had a dream where you can't breathe and it's real scary?
[04:05:40.040 --> 04:05:41.201]  I've had a few of those, and she was like...
[04:05:48.006 --> 04:05:52.827]  I mean, it went on and it was like a slave... People are doubting me.
[04:05:52.827 --> 04:05:53.928]  I may just play the audio.
[04:05:53.928 --> 04:05:59.869]  I just remembered I recorded it as backup in case they edited me.
[04:05:59.869 --> 04:06:05.430]  And this went on for about 30 seconds and she said, is that the gun?
[04:06:05.430 --> 04:06:08.670]  And all I could see was the butt of it on the shelf.
[04:06:08.670 --> 04:06:11.491]  You know, the handle.
[04:06:11.491 --> 04:06:11.591]  And
[04:06:13.004 --> 04:06:14.267]  I said, yeah.
[04:06:14.267 --> 04:06:15.771]  I mean, I protect myself.
[04:06:15.771 --> 04:06:16.633]  I protect my office.
[04:06:16.633 --> 04:06:18.397]  We got guys looking still carrying here as well.
[04:06:19.284 --> 04:06:39.484]  And she just, I'm sorry, I just didn't, I just didn't expect, hold on, hold on, I'm collecting my, this is not a joke folks, we can continue, and she's going, and the next question, but this woman sees body scanners scanning her naked body, cameras, troops in black uniforms marching.
[04:06:39.484 --> 04:06:41.586]  If you know history, that's what scares you.
[04:06:41.586 --> 04:06:43.528]  Whoa, I'm going into a third world dictatorship.
[04:06:44.497 --> 04:06:45.798]  But no, she wasn't worried about that.
[04:06:45.798 --> 04:06:49.579]  And it turned out this woman's been all over the world, combat zones, you name it.
[04:06:49.579 --> 04:06:52.200]  She's not scared because there it's troops with guns.
[04:06:52.200 --> 04:06:54.341]  They're allowed to have guns.
[04:06:54.341 --> 04:06:56.922]  But you see a slave.
[04:06:56.922 --> 04:07:00.204]  This is a woman who'll fly into combat zones, she's not afraid.
[04:07:00.204 --> 04:07:07.046]  But to see a fellow slave with a gun is blasphemy.
[04:07:07.046 --> 04:07:10.088]  It's just absolute, total, and complete blasphemy.
[04:07:11.078 --> 04:07:16.963]  I mean, this was sacrilege to her, to see a blood bag.
[04:07:16.963 --> 04:07:21.927]  I mean, that's what I am, like the Matrix or like the movie.
[04:07:21.927 --> 04:07:23.828]  What's the new vampire movie?
[04:07:23.828 --> 04:07:27.331]  Rob recommended it, so I watched it when I was on the treadmill with Ethan Hawke.
[04:07:27.331 --> 04:07:28.152]  It's really good.
[04:07:28.152 --> 04:07:29.633]  I just watched it last week.
[04:07:29.633 --> 04:07:30.334]  What's the name of it?
[04:07:31.837 --> 04:07:34.439]  Go ask Jacobson the name of the new Ethan Hawke vampire movie.
[04:07:34.439 --> 04:07:39.462]  I know we're having a big big powwow in there right now, but I need this information.
[04:07:39.462 --> 04:07:41.584]  I need this information.
[04:07:41.584 --> 04:07:42.784]  I need this information.
[04:07:42.784 --> 04:07:44.486]  Or I can get up and go get it.
[04:07:44.486 --> 04:07:50.329]  I need the name of that movie.
[04:07:50.329 --> 04:07:52.051]  But the point is that
[04:07:53.427 --> 04:07:54.287]  That's what we are.
[04:07:54.287 --> 04:07:58.968]  We're like creatures in a machine sucking our blood.
[04:07:58.968 --> 04:08:00.429]  We're like cattle.
[04:08:00.429 --> 04:08:05.130]  We are seen here to provide daybreakers.
[04:08:05.130 --> 04:08:11.371]  We are here to provide our souls, our money, our kids, everything.
[04:08:11.371 --> 04:08:16.233]  The globalists see it as if they control the entire society.
[04:08:16.233 --> 04:08:20.534]  And so this woman sees troops, SWAT teams, guns, FEMA camps.
[04:08:20.534 --> 04:08:21.474]  She feels safe.
[04:08:22.054 --> 04:08:34.862]  When she sees big black armored vehicles and tanks and big monolithic government buildings and thugs and CPS grabbing children and corruption, she just cozies up like a snake around their leg.
[04:08:34.862 --> 04:08:45.969]  But she comes into some red-blooded, tanned, redneck American who isn't her slave, and she comes in here with a man with a little bit of hair on his chest, and it just scares the living daylights out of her.
[04:08:45.969 --> 04:08:49.071]  She had thought she'd entered the ninth circle of hell.
[04:08:49.071 --> 04:08:51.493]  She was in a room with a forked
[04:08:56.057 --> 04:08:57.898]  This is a domesticated slave.
[04:08:57.898 --> 04:08:59.820]  This is a domesticated worm.
[04:08:59.820 --> 04:09:01.641]  This is a domesticated serf.
[04:09:01.641 --> 04:09:06.545]  This is someone who sees a human who isn't castrated.
[04:09:07.654 --> 04:09:14.720]  I mean, I would imagine a domesticated pig in a pig pen watching a wild pig run around, you know, out there in the field, a hundred yards away.
[04:09:14.720 --> 04:09:15.961]  That'd probably actually scare a pig.
[04:09:15.961 --> 04:09:18.283]  Because it would have memories of being a free hog.
[04:09:18.283 --> 04:09:21.866]  It would have memories of running around squealing and rooting and having a good time.
[04:09:21.866 --> 04:09:24.768]  And it'd be sitting there eating its slop about to get slaughtered.
[04:09:24.768 --> 04:09:27.010]  It'd, oh, that's another pig.
[04:09:27.010 --> 04:09:27.590]  That's scary.
[04:09:27.590 --> 04:09:34.035]  And it would squeal and run over to the humans and curl up and do something about that pig out there.
[04:09:34.035 --> 04:09:35.056]  It's so deadly.
[04:09:35.056 --> 04:09:36.657]  I mean, it's disgusting.
[04:09:37.580 --> 04:09:49.588]  It's like a cow in a squeeze chute at a slaughterhouse before the gas bolt comes down and drives a hammer into its head and fells it and kills it so it can be rendered down into T-bone steaks.
[04:09:49.588 --> 04:09:52.890]  Imagine it getting angry at a cow in a field.
[04:09:52.890 --> 04:09:54.912]  Oh, look at that cow in a field.
[04:09:54.912 --> 04:09:56.012]  It has horns.
[04:09:56.012 --> 04:09:57.373]  It hasn't been dehorned.
[04:09:57.373 --> 04:09:59.555]  I had my horns cut off a long time ago.
[04:09:59.555 --> 04:10:01.156]  I've had all my vaccines.
[04:10:01.156 --> 04:10:03.297]  I'm going into the slaughterhouse.
[04:10:03.297 --> 04:10:04.758]  Oh, I like the government.
[04:10:04.758 --> 04:10:05.519]  Oh, I love it.
[04:10:05.519 --> 04:10:07.300]  I'm here by my legs and drain me of blood.
[04:10:07.660 --> 04:10:08.681]  I love serving government.
[04:10:08.681 --> 04:10:09.422]  It's so much fun.
[04:10:09.422 --> 04:10:11.424]  It's so good.
[04:10:11.424 --> 04:10:19.211]  I mean, literally, you've got to experience... It's like that video we have in Road to Tyranny of the police own squad car at a checkpoint.
[04:10:19.211 --> 04:10:20.793]  They're searching everybody's cars.
[04:10:20.793 --> 04:10:24.776]  Abby Newman, one of my listeners, naval veteran, no criminal record, in town buying canning equipment.
[04:10:24.776 --> 04:10:25.917]  They say, we want to search her car.
[04:10:25.917 --> 04:10:26.698]  She says no.
[04:10:26.698 --> 04:10:32.003]  They open the trunk up, put her in handcuffs, find a pocket constitution, and start hyperventilating on video going...
[04:10:33.124 --> 04:10:35.006]  I can't believe she's got one!
[04:10:35.006 --> 04:10:36.408]  We found an extremist!
[04:10:36.408 --> 04:10:38.250]  She's got paraphernalia!
[04:10:38.250 --> 04:10:41.974]  I can't believe, it's just, I can't believe we found one of these people!
[04:10:41.974 --> 04:10:43.015]  And he's like, what do we do?
[04:10:43.015 --> 04:10:44.096]  Do we arrest her for this?
[04:10:44.096 --> 04:10:50.142]  And the supervisor comes over, and this is in Virginia, he goes, I don't know, maybe she's, is she allowed to have that?
[04:10:50.803 --> 04:10:54.206]  Maybe that's what she's talking about when she says she has rights.
[04:10:54.206 --> 04:10:56.268]  I don't care, go ahead and arrest her.
[04:10:56.268 --> 04:10:59.811]  I mean, you don't go right!
[04:10:59.811 --> 04:11:01.872]  You don't!
[04:11:01.872 --> 04:11:03.514]  So I guess it's the same thing.
[04:11:03.514 --> 04:11:06.076]  We got one with a pocket constitution!
[04:11:06.076 --> 04:11:07.777]  It's the same thing with this British woman.
[04:11:07.777 --> 04:11:15.704]  Oh my God, is that a... It was tears.
[04:11:15.704 --> 04:11:17.626]  It was like a Monty Python episode.
[04:11:20.111 --> 04:11:24.139]  It was like in A Fish Called Wanda when the guy can't talk and he's stuttering.
[04:11:24.139 --> 04:11:28.768]  You know when the guy's stuttering when the guy's eating his fish?
[04:11:30.819 --> 04:11:32.380]  Some fish and chips, hmm?
[04:11:32.380 --> 04:11:36.863]  So, I mean, it just goes on and on and on.
[04:11:36.863 --> 04:11:39.444]  I have seen the mind-control slaves.
[04:11:39.444 --> 04:11:47.169]  I have seen state police going, literally going, oh my God, look at that.
[04:11:47.169 --> 04:11:48.389]  People, go watch Road to Tyranny.
[04:11:48.389 --> 04:11:49.170]  It's a three-hour film.
[04:11:49.170 --> 04:11:50.671]  It's like two and a half hours in.
[04:11:50.671 --> 04:11:52.452]  From the squad car!
[04:11:52.452 --> 04:11:54.353]  You cannot make the magnitude up of this.
[04:11:56.394 --> 04:11:59.536]  But I mean, in that woman you see the whole world.
[04:11:59.536 --> 04:12:09.242]  This is a person, again, who saw the butt of this gun sticking out.
[04:12:09.242 --> 04:12:16.267]  She saw this in a shelf.
[04:12:16.267 --> 04:12:16.487]  I mean,
[04:12:18.729 --> 04:12:20.030]  Amazing!
[04:12:20.030 --> 04:12:20.811]  Amazing!
[04:12:20.811 --> 04:12:25.715]  To her, that I am here to defend myself, I'm not living in fear, I'm living in power.
[04:12:25.715 --> 04:12:26.956]  I'm living as a sovereign.
[04:12:26.956 --> 04:12:28.877]  I'm going to defend myself.
[04:12:28.877 --> 04:12:34.462]  Instead, they lock down schools when a gunman's in them, and make them get under the chairs so they're not running.
[04:12:34.462 --> 04:12:38.885]  They don't tell them, go out the window, go out the nearest exit, we'll direct you.
[04:12:38.885 --> 04:12:40.907]  They don't say, we have the principal with a gun.
[04:12:40.907 --> 04:12:42.828]  That's happened a few times where they've stopped mass shootings.
[04:12:42.828 --> 04:12:46.751]  No, they say, you go get under your chair and wait for them to blow your head off.
[04:12:47.532 --> 04:12:56.821]  So I was supposed to see if gunmen come in here, I'm supposed to, oh yes sir, you're going to kill me, let me get in a fetal position so you don't have to look me in the eyes.
[04:12:56.821 --> 04:13:05.149]  Again, it's the same training in Nazi Germany, where you see those big pits, those 16mm films shot by the Nazis, they're all standing around satisfied in a power trip.
[04:13:06.010 --> 04:13:09.875]  They got their guys with machine guns lined up, there's pits, and, you know, they dig these pits.
[04:13:09.875 --> 04:13:12.077]  They don't want to bury just one group.
[04:13:12.077 --> 04:13:15.521]  There's already 50, 60 bodies in there, in groups of 10.
[04:13:15.521 --> 04:13:20.667]  They run the next line through, and the guys have their hats in hand, and they bow respectfully.
[04:13:20.667 --> 04:13:22.670]  Oh, thank you, mister, you're gonna kill me.
[04:13:22.670 --> 04:13:24.051]  I mean, so what if you got a gun?
[04:13:24.051 --> 04:13:24.652]  I'm gonna run up and...
[04:13:25.433 --> 04:13:26.494]  I try to bite him.
[04:13:26.494 --> 04:13:27.694]  I'm going to gouge his eyes out.
[04:13:27.694 --> 04:13:28.815]  I'm going to headbutt.
[04:13:28.815 --> 04:13:30.575]  You want to see somebody go hog wild?
[04:13:30.575 --> 04:13:31.816]  Not that I'm anything special.
[04:13:31.816 --> 04:13:33.317]  I'm a wild human, baby.
[04:13:33.317 --> 04:13:34.137]  I'm free.
[04:13:34.137 --> 04:13:35.978]  I got testosterone.
[04:13:35.978 --> 04:13:37.839]  Nobody cut my testicles off.
[04:13:37.839 --> 04:13:39.760]  Nobody sucked my soul out.
[04:13:39.760 --> 04:13:46.243]  But no, they, you know, on those black and white films, they have the hat in their hand and they run down into the pit.
[04:13:46.243 --> 04:13:47.843]  And then get their heads blown off.
[04:13:47.843 --> 04:13:49.624]  And the next group, get in there.
[04:13:49.624 --> 04:13:50.084]  Yes, sir.
[04:13:50.084 --> 04:13:51.865]  Thank you.
[04:13:51.865 --> 04:13:53.266]  I'm going to do what you say.
[04:13:54.542 --> 04:14:01.284]  She sees all of this tyranny that should worry her, that should concern her instincts, and she doesn't care.
[04:14:01.284 --> 04:14:04.744]  She cares that I am not a slave.
[04:14:04.744 --> 04:14:05.805]  It is fundamental.
[04:14:05.805 --> 04:14:09.165]  Her religion is being prostrate before tyranny.
[04:14:09.165 --> 04:14:11.426]  Her religion is being a victim.
[04:14:11.426 --> 04:14:13.426]  Her religion is being weak.
[04:14:13.426 --> 04:14:15.607]  Her religion is being domesticated!
[04:14:16.837 --> 04:14:17.297]  Think about it.
[04:14:17.297 --> 04:14:24.539]  Some woman whose ancestors were the wild and wonderful people of Britain, who the Romans feared whenever they invaded.
[04:14:24.539 --> 04:14:25.460]  Not anymore.
[04:14:25.460 --> 04:14:35.883]  She's just a domesticator after 1,900 years of domestication.
[04:14:35.883 --> 04:14:40.785]  I mean, this is insanity, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:14:40.785 --> 04:14:44.306]  This is... Think of... Who would want to marry a woman?
[04:14:45.086 --> 04:14:52.251]  Who you'd have kids with, and if somebody tried to assault your kids at the park or at home when you're not there, wouldn't defend your children.
[04:14:52.251 --> 04:15:00.496]  I want a woman who's sweet and beautiful and calm and ladylike, but who can turn into an absolute vicious killer!
[04:15:00.976 --> 04:15:03.497]  And that's what women are supposed to be like if they need to be.
[04:15:03.497 --> 04:15:06.737]  Not these little domesticated prissy things that can't stand up for themselves.
[04:15:06.737 --> 04:15:07.998]  That's real feminism.
[04:15:07.998 --> 04:15:17.440]  Real feminism is when somebody knocks down your college daughter's door to rape her, she fires 14 rounds of .45 Magnum into them.
[04:15:17.440 --> 04:15:20.001]  That's what feminism is!
[04:15:20.001 --> 04:15:21.241]  Not your crap!
[04:15:21.241 --> 04:15:22.781]  Alright, I've had enough of it.
[04:15:22.781 --> 04:15:23.862]  I've had enough of scum.
[04:15:23.862 --> 04:15:25.762]  I've had enough of domestication.
[04:15:25.762 --> 04:15:28.343]  I've had enough of people that tell me I've got to be a pathetic slave.
[04:15:28.343 --> 04:15:29.003]  Come on in, Erin.
[04:15:31.838 --> 04:15:34.040]  More reports on deadly fluoride, thank you.
[04:15:34.040 --> 04:15:41.490]  Alright, I'm ranting, because this is someone who's not domesticated.
[04:15:41.490 --> 04:15:44.654]  Would you rather be me, or rather be... But remember...
[04:15:45.469 --> 04:15:49.492]  Remember, she'd be very polite in Nazi Germany, directed into a pit.
[04:15:49.492 --> 04:15:51.833]  Or, take your clothes off, get ready to go in there for showers.
[04:15:51.833 --> 04:15:55.476]  Yes, sir, thank you for the reasonable way you're treating us.
[04:15:55.476 --> 04:16:00.960]  I've decided I don't agree with your politics exactly, but I do agree with authority.
[04:16:00.960 --> 04:16:02.861]  Let me take my clothes off.
[04:16:02.861 --> 04:16:05.743]  A sort of gun, officer, quite fancy.
[04:16:05.743 --> 04:16:08.605]  I feel quite good with you with that gun.
[04:16:08.605 --> 04:16:14.049]  But citizens having guns, now that is entirely improper!
[04:16:18.528 --> 04:16:20.428]  Oh, help me, Lord.
[04:16:20.428 --> 04:16:28.190]  I've been on the radio too long today.
[04:16:28.190 --> 04:16:39.112]  And here is the God of the domesticated slave, Chris Fruitbox.
[04:16:39.112 --> 04:16:41.153]  I just pumped the dog look on his face.
[04:16:42.722 --> 04:16:43.342]  I'm sorry.
[04:16:43.342 --> 04:16:46.744]  He's just such a weak little sniveling manipulator.
[04:16:46.744 --> 04:16:48.245]  He enjoys manipulating you.
[04:16:48.245 --> 04:16:49.646]  He thinks you're stupid.
[04:16:49.646 --> 04:16:51.867]  He loves the elite power over the masses.
[04:16:51.867 --> 04:16:53.488]  He loves dumbing you down.
[04:16:53.488 --> 04:17:02.913]  He loves feeling like he's a master controller and prancing around with pot-bellied old rotten new order trash and little cocktail parties slithering around.
[04:17:02.913 --> 04:17:05.114]  This is your enemy right here, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:17:05.114 --> 04:17:06.355]  This is the traitor.
[04:17:06.355 --> 04:17:08.956]  This is the type of person that sells the country out.
[04:17:08.956 --> 04:17:11.978]  This is the type of person that loves the destruction of liberty and freedom.
[04:17:13.968 --> 04:17:19.371]  This is the person who loves... Most of the people that I've met from MSNBC are British women.
[04:17:19.371 --> 04:17:20.432]  They're like, these are perfect!
[04:17:20.432 --> 04:17:21.653]  They're scared of everything.
[04:17:21.653 --> 04:17:24.355]  They lick the first black uniform boots they see.
[04:17:24.355 --> 04:17:25.375]  They hate the family.
[04:17:25.375 --> 04:17:26.736]  They love world government.
[04:17:26.736 --> 04:17:27.457]  Bring them in!
[04:17:27.457 --> 04:17:28.777]  Ha ha ha!
[04:17:28.777 --> 04:17:34.261]  They'll make TV for America!
[04:17:34.261 --> 04:17:36.222]  Now, why am I so angry at them?
[04:17:36.222 --> 04:17:37.303]  I knew what the production would be.
[04:17:37.303 --> 04:17:40.665]  Guys with machine guns running around in between clips of Hitler.
[04:17:40.665 --> 04:17:41.826]  And it's exactly that.
[04:17:42.898 --> 04:17:48.621]  We have the full script.
[04:17:48.621 --> 04:17:51.783]  They may have changed it, but the email we got said this is the script that was used.
[04:17:51.783 --> 04:17:53.624]  This is the voiceover script.
[04:17:53.624 --> 04:17:58.947]  You can read the full script at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[04:17:58.947 --> 04:18:04.491]  And then Paul Watson has another article that he has written about it.
[04:18:04.491 --> 04:18:07.092]  In fact, I'm going to pull the internet up here so I can see it.
[04:18:07.092 --> 04:18:07.933]  At PrisonPlanet.com.
[04:18:11.007 --> 04:18:19.795]  And at PrisonPlanet.com, MSNBC hit piece smears Tea Party as neo-Nazis.
[04:18:19.795 --> 04:18:23.178]  And yeah, not only if you don't want government health care, you are a racist.
[04:18:23.178 --> 04:18:26.621]  If you don't want trillions of the banks, you hate Jews.
[04:18:26.621 --> 04:18:32.086]  No, now they actually say that we are Hitler and that we want to overthrow America like Hitler did.
[04:18:35.177 --> 04:18:36.658]  And we've got to be dealt with.
[04:18:36.658 --> 04:18:39.919]  Over and over again they say, is Jones going to go out and kill law enforcement?
[04:18:39.919 --> 04:18:40.559]  No.
[04:18:40.559 --> 04:18:44.420]  But his supporters are.
[04:18:44.420 --> 04:18:46.201]  I mean, this is mind control.
[04:18:46.201 --> 04:18:51.883]  Let me just read, we've highlighted the transcript here, and I'll give you guys a document cam shot now on this.
[04:18:55.848 --> 04:18:57.328]  Let me just start here with a transcript.
[04:18:57.328 --> 04:18:58.749]  Show open the new right.
[04:18:58.749 --> 04:19:00.349]  Tea parties and third parties.
[04:19:00.349 --> 04:19:02.110]  Gun rights and states rights.
[04:19:02.110 --> 04:19:05.391]  From just right of center to out on the fringes.
[04:19:05.391 --> 04:19:06.851]  See, we control reality.
[04:19:06.851 --> 04:19:08.912]  We tell you what you're allowed to think.
[04:19:08.912 --> 04:19:10.132]  Who are they?
[04:19:10.132 --> 04:19:12.893]  And just what do they want?
[04:19:12.893 --> 04:19:14.353]  Political change?
[04:19:14.353 --> 04:19:17.074]  Or to overthrow the government?
[04:19:17.074 --> 04:19:20.635]  Oh yeah, this is getting you ready for Homeland Security and the MIAC report to be used against the American people.
[04:19:21.226 --> 04:19:26.773]  And I have the New York Times here where they're attacking the Amish, shutting them down, saying it's not good for the environment.
[04:19:26.773 --> 04:19:27.895]  In fact, where's my New York Times?
[04:19:27.895 --> 04:19:31.339]  Will you guys reprint me that New York Times about the Amish being hit and hit hard?
[04:19:31.339 --> 04:19:33.122]  Because everybody knows they're Al Qaeda too.
[04:19:35.888 --> 04:19:40.953]  It goes on, Chris on camp, don't tread on me, the Gadsden flag has become a symbol of a new right.
[04:19:40.953 --> 04:19:47.479]  Oh no, it's not populists, it's not liberty lovers, it's the new right to keep you in that right-wing paradigm where they can control you.
[04:19:47.479 --> 04:19:52.343]  It's flown at tea parties, anti-government rallies, and militia group training sessions, even by members of Congress.
[04:19:54.385 --> 04:19:57.927]  Oh, an American flag from the Revolutionary War.
[04:19:57.927 --> 04:20:00.469]  How dare these members of Congress!
[04:20:00.469 --> 04:20:07.134]  And I have another article here where new constitutions handed out in colleges and in Congress.
[04:20:07.134 --> 04:20:07.794]  Where's that article?
[04:20:07.794 --> 04:20:15.860]  You guys brought it in earlier and I've actually gotten a copy of that and it says this is from hundreds of years ago and is not politically correct and is racist and
[04:20:16.929 --> 04:20:25.817]  The Constitution's bad, and Chris Matthews is, hmm, yes, he'll deal with it, he'll tell you what to think, little Chris Matthews.
[04:20:25.817 --> 04:20:27.578]  Don't tread on me!
[04:20:27.578 --> 04:20:36.446]  And then it just goes on and on and on, page after page, saying, militia groups, militia, militia, militia members, militia, militia.
[04:20:36.446 --> 04:20:38.227]  So they start saying, militia, militia, militia.
[04:20:39.088 --> 04:20:41.409]  And Militia, Militia, Militia, Militia, Militia, Militia.
[04:20:41.409 --> 04:20:42.170]  They're gonna kill you.
[04:20:42.170 --> 04:20:42.950]  They're gonna get you.
[04:20:42.950 --> 04:20:43.630]  They're violent.
[04:20:43.630 --> 04:20:44.671]  They're evil.
[04:20:44.671 --> 04:20:46.072]  This is the biggest hit piece I've ever seen.
[04:20:46.072 --> 04:20:47.832]  You've got to go read it for yourself.
[04:20:47.832 --> 04:20:51.975]  And just deeper into the article, because I'm the whole end.
[04:20:51.975 --> 04:20:57.457]  I mean, I'm their finale here at the end of this.
[04:20:57.457 --> 04:21:04.501]  But as you go through it, then it goes into Jews and talks about Jews over and over and over.
[04:21:05.939 --> 04:21:10.601]  And over again, militia groups, Jews were responsible for the Great Depression.
[04:21:10.601 --> 04:21:15.604]  They'll probably edit this YouTube video and say I said that, that's how they operate.
[04:21:15.604 --> 04:21:24.708]  Jews were responsible for the Great Depression, were responsible for the continuation of hard times, and that maybe Adolf Hitler in Germany had some right ideas.
[04:21:24.708 --> 04:21:28.390]  So they go back to the 30s and 40s, to Father Coughlin,
[04:21:29.460 --> 04:21:37.702]  And say that they have to go back then to find somebody who was criticizing corrupt banks.
[04:21:37.702 --> 04:21:41.342]  And so the message is, if you believe the banks are robbing you, what does Glenn Beck say?
[04:21:41.342 --> 04:21:44.783]  Bilderberg Group's good, you're racist if you criticize it.
[04:21:44.783 --> 04:21:46.203]  What is Limbaugh saying every week?
[04:21:46.203 --> 04:21:49.984]  So they got the right wing and the controlled left wing doing this.
[04:21:49.984 --> 04:21:53.425]  Father Coughlin, the Jew, the Christian, and persecution, 2622.
[04:21:53.425 --> 04:21:57.426]  It is my opinion that Nazism, the effect of communism, cannot be liquidated in
[04:21:59.861 --> 04:22:29.401]  persecution complex until the religious Jews in high places and synagogue and finance radio and press attack the cause attack forthright the errors the spread of communism together with their nations who support it then they cut to tea parties criticizing communism and the message is you support Hitler and they say this guy supported Hitler so they go back 60 70 years ago and go this guy supported Hitler and he didn't like communism so if you criticize communism you want to murder Jews
[04:22:30.562 --> 04:22:34.408]  So now you're Nazis.
[04:22:34.408 --> 04:22:41.539]  Before these rumors about government tyranny reach the mainstream, they often start with an extremely popular internet radio host named Alex Jones.
[04:22:41.539 --> 04:22:42.721]  What does the Washington Post say?
[04:22:43.613 --> 04:22:43.733]  Yes.
[04:23:03.422 --> 04:23:09.885]  I'm on a whole bunch of AM and FM stations, and you know it full well.
[04:23:09.885 --> 04:23:12.727]  Okay, you know my audience is bigger than you, Chris Matthews.
[04:23:12.727 --> 04:23:13.607]  A lot bigger.
[04:23:13.607 --> 04:23:16.489]  Go to AlexaRatings for InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[04:23:17.711 --> 04:23:18.312]  Go to it.
[04:23:18.312 --> 04:23:18.992]  Much bigger.
[04:23:18.992 --> 04:23:20.994]  Thousands of times bigger than Limbaugh's.
[04:23:20.994 --> 04:23:22.695]  Thousands of times bigger than Hannity.
[04:23:22.695 --> 04:23:23.956]  Go look at the ratings.
[04:23:23.956 --> 04:23:26.299]  Put Limbaugh in next to my website.
[04:23:26.299 --> 04:23:27.640]  One of my websites.
[04:23:27.640 --> 04:23:30.482]  And tens of thousands bigger than you, Matthews.
[04:23:30.482 --> 04:23:32.244]  Your private website doesn't even show up.
[04:23:32.244 --> 04:23:35.767]  We're beginning to dwarf MSNBC, the entire website.
[04:23:35.767 --> 04:23:38.609]  You don't like that, do you, Matthews?
[04:23:38.609 --> 04:23:39.430]  No, you don't.
[04:23:39.430 --> 04:23:41.372]  So you're going to say, I'm Hitler.
[04:23:43.083 --> 04:23:48.126]  But don't do it too much because, you know, people actually look into it and find out that all the Nazi groups are government-financed.
[04:23:48.126 --> 04:23:51.028]  All the big ones like Hal Turner and others who attack me 24-7.
[04:23:51.028 --> 04:23:53.770]  It's going to come out that your little buddies are running all this, isn't it, buddy?
[04:23:53.770 --> 04:23:55.812]  Yeah.
[04:23:55.812 --> 04:23:58.634]  Before these rumors about government tyranny reach the mainstream.
[04:23:58.634 --> 04:23:59.854]  So this is, you know, near the end.
[04:23:59.854 --> 04:24:01.936]  They're going to tell you who the really evil guy is.
[04:24:01.936 --> 04:24:06.079]  Often they start with an extremely popular internet radio host named Alex Jones.
[04:24:07.353 --> 04:24:12.115]  And then it goes on to say, we're going to look at the types of tyrants in the Obama administration.
[04:24:12.115 --> 04:24:17.238]  And they have none of my quotes from Cass Sunstein saying arrest us and ban free speech from that day.
[04:24:17.238 --> 04:24:26.463]  Or none of the quotes of all these other officials in government and senators saying ban free speech and ban talk radio and put taxes on it and all the rest of it.
[04:24:26.463 --> 04:24:28.283]  None of my evidence!
[04:24:28.283 --> 04:24:30.945]  Just, oh, we're going to look at some of the tyrants.
[04:24:32.301 --> 04:24:35.302]  Jones claims he has 2 million listeners for his internet broadcast.
[04:24:35.302 --> 04:24:36.903]  See, more disinformation.
[04:24:36.903 --> 04:24:40.504]  They know full well I'm on all these radio stations.
[04:24:40.504 --> 04:24:41.224]  Doesn't matter.
[04:24:41.224 --> 04:24:44.126]  They're going to lie to their audience and tell them I'm not on AM and FM.
[04:24:44.126 --> 04:24:47.227]  Just like I've seen CNN say, Ron Paul's insane.
[04:24:47.227 --> 04:24:50.348]  He believes there's something called a trans-Texas corridor.
[04:24:50.348 --> 04:24:51.188]  A group of toll roads.
[04:24:53.589 --> 04:25:02.952]  25 million people in Texas, and they're watching CNN when there's billboards up everywhere and the governor announcing it, saying Trans-Texas Corridor, and they're saying it doesn't exist.
[04:25:02.952 --> 04:25:04.813]  Keep it up, CNN!
[04:25:04.813 --> 04:25:08.694]  When you said that four years ago, you had 3 million viewers at night.
[04:25:08.694 --> 04:25:10.434]  Now you've got less than a million.
[04:25:10.434 --> 04:25:11.295]  Great job.
[04:25:11.295 --> 04:25:12.515]  Keep it up.
[04:25:12.515 --> 04:25:18.337]  Tell people there's no NAFTA Highway or Trans-Texas Corridor as it's being built everywhere here.
[04:25:18.337 --> 04:25:19.697]  Please, continue!
[04:25:19.697 --> 04:25:20.878]  Please!
[04:25:20.878 --> 04:25:21.838]  Don't let me stop you!
[04:25:24.733 --> 04:25:26.094]  Unbelievable.
[04:25:26.094 --> 04:25:33.779]  And it goes on, um, Jones claims he has 2 million listeners for his internet broadcasts, that millions more watch his YouTube broadcasts.
[04:25:33.779 --> 04:25:37.601]  We can go to one of our YouTube channels and see 50 million views right there.
[04:25:37.601 --> 04:25:42.985]  Think of everywhere else, 6 million views, 3 million views, 2 million views, a million views, 400,000 views, a million views.
[04:25:42.985 --> 04:25:44.886]  I mean, hundreds and hundreds of millions!
[04:25:44.886 --> 04:25:47.207]  I don't claim I have millions on YouTube!
[04:25:47.207 --> 04:25:49.609]  That lady said, how many do you have on YouTube?
[04:25:50.149 --> 04:25:51.470]  And I said, well, come look at this video.
[04:25:51.470 --> 04:25:53.591]  I got three million here, five million there, six million here.
[04:25:53.591 --> 04:25:55.351]  Let me show you a few YouTube videos.
[04:25:55.351 --> 04:25:56.312]  That's all right.
[04:25:56.312 --> 04:25:57.012]  That's all right.
[04:25:57.012 --> 04:25:58.833]  We can look into that for ourselves.
[04:25:58.833 --> 04:26:00.694]  Thank you, Mr. Jones.
[04:26:00.694 --> 04:26:02.455]  Thank you.
[04:26:02.455 --> 04:26:07.117]  I don't want you to actually show me the hit counter on YouTube.
[04:26:07.117 --> 04:26:11.419]  I want to lie my big fat butt off on national TV about you.
[04:26:11.419 --> 04:26:12.539]  Well, good lady.
[04:26:12.539 --> 04:26:15.601]  I'm going to expose you as a domesticated worm.
[04:26:17.270 --> 04:26:18.391]  And genuine!
[04:26:18.391 --> 04:26:19.172]  It's so frightening!
[04:26:19.172 --> 04:26:21.373]  He speaks with a loud voice!
[04:26:21.373 --> 04:26:25.076]  More fluoride in his water immediately!
[04:26:25.076 --> 04:26:26.277]  That's not working!
[04:26:26.277 --> 04:26:30.881]  Increase the poison level!
[04:26:30.881 --> 04:26:32.762]  This is ridiculous!
[04:26:32.762 --> 04:26:34.624]  You're a bunch of scum!
[04:26:34.624 --> 04:26:38.567]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[04:26:38.567 --> 04:26:44.051]  He also has several websites full of articles supporting his fears of government oppression and tyrannical new order.
[04:26:44.051 --> 04:26:45.052]  Yeah, like legislation.
[04:26:46.175 --> 04:26:48.357]  Like quotes from the Globalist own publication.
[04:26:48.357 --> 04:26:49.537]  She means stuff like that.
[04:26:49.537 --> 04:26:51.579]  So I claim I have millions.
[04:26:51.579 --> 04:26:52.680]  I claim.
[04:26:52.680 --> 04:26:56.202]  I claim.
[04:26:56.202 --> 04:26:59.024]  Jones claims he reaches two million listeners.
[04:26:59.024 --> 04:27:00.645]  That's very conservative, by the way.
[04:27:00.645 --> 04:27:01.606]  How about five million?
[04:27:01.606 --> 04:27:02.727]  That's what the numbers really show.
[04:27:02.727 --> 04:27:06.209]  How about we underestimate so you don't even know?
[04:27:06.209 --> 04:27:11.053]  How about we're sneaking up on your fat butt and you finally figured it out, haven't you?
[04:27:11.843 --> 04:27:13.749]  I finally figured out we're not going anywhere, scum.
[04:27:13.749 --> 04:27:14.733]  You're not gonna win.
[04:27:14.733 --> 04:27:16.679]  America, you've had America down too long.
[04:27:16.679 --> 04:27:17.381]  You understand that?
[04:27:20.700 --> 04:27:28.966]  Jones claims he has 2 million listeners for his internet broadcast and millions more watch his YouTube broadcast and his 24 documentaries.
[04:27:28.966 --> 04:27:35.050]  He also has several websites full of articles supporting his fears of government oppression and tyrannical New World Order.
[04:27:35.050 --> 04:27:43.035]  No, naked body scanning kids and storing the images and taking babies' blood at birth for Pentagon databases for race-specific bioweapons admitted.
[04:27:43.035 --> 04:27:46.237]  I mean, that's not scary.
[04:27:46.237 --> 04:27:49.179]  Invading all these countries, lying about WMDs.
[04:27:49.179 --> 04:27:49.900]  That's not scary.
[04:27:50.980 --> 04:27:54.345]  Bush bragging about ordering torture of people again last week.
[04:27:54.345 --> 04:27:55.687]  That's not scary.
[04:27:55.687 --> 04:27:56.268]  No, it's not scary.
[04:27:57.870 --> 04:28:05.555]  All the mobsters in the Obama administration, openly engaged in crime, openly getting free houses from donors, and not getting in trouble?
[04:28:05.555 --> 04:28:07.817]  That's not tyranny.
[04:28:07.817 --> 04:28:08.237]  That's right.
[04:28:08.237 --> 04:28:09.778]  Because you're a bunch of crooks!
[04:28:09.778 --> 04:28:10.979]  You're a bunch of scum!
[04:28:10.979 --> 04:28:14.982]  You're a stinking mafia of arrogant bastards who think we're here to lick your boots!
[04:28:14.982 --> 04:28:16.563]  It's over, scum!
[04:28:16.563 --> 04:28:20.286]  You can kill us individually, you can put some of us in prison, but you're not getting all of us.
[04:28:20.286 --> 04:28:21.627]  You understand that, Phil?
[04:28:21.627 --> 04:28:22.988]  There's red blood still in America.
[04:28:25.427 --> 04:28:26.988]  Then they just go on and demonize me.
[04:28:26.988 --> 04:28:29.370]  They say, we are just about done.
[04:28:29.370 --> 04:28:30.451]  We are fried.
[04:28:30.451 --> 04:28:31.892]  I mean, we are in deep tyranny.
[04:28:31.892 --> 04:28:33.414]  Deep, deep, deep.
[04:28:33.414 --> 04:28:39.118]  We have a psychopathic elite who have formed a global guild of psychopaths.
[04:28:39.118 --> 04:28:40.579]  They have their systems.
[04:28:40.579 --> 04:28:41.720]  They have their language.
[04:28:41.720 --> 04:28:43.622]  They have their whole communication system.
[04:28:43.622 --> 04:28:51.348]  They are in control of the planet, and they're setting up a planetary police state to carry out an orderly extermination of at least 80%
[04:28:52.629 --> 04:28:53.990]  Some say 99.
[04:28:53.990 --> 04:28:57.234]  I mean, they debate the numbers of us they want to kill.
[04:28:57.234 --> 04:29:00.757]  All on record, I've got Peter Singer, heck, where's my New York Times?
[04:29:00.757 --> 04:29:05.922]  Today, today, saying we shouldn't be allowed to have one baby now.
[04:29:05.922 --> 04:29:06.662]  Here it is.
[04:29:06.662 --> 04:29:09.845]  Peter Singer, who calls humans a disease,
[04:29:11.126 --> 04:29:17.688]  One of the heads of one of the departments at Princeton, Dr. Peter Singer, who says your animals should be able to sue you.
[04:29:17.688 --> 04:29:23.909]  Dr. Peter Singer, who is an open eugenicist, who openly calls for forced population reduction.
[04:29:23.909 --> 04:29:25.509]  Should this be the last generation?
[04:29:25.509 --> 04:29:26.629]  This is today.
[04:29:26.629 --> 04:29:28.550]  I'm not even looking for this stuff.
[04:29:28.550 --> 04:29:29.370]  Well, I found it today.
[04:29:29.370 --> 04:29:29.850]  It's June 6th.
[04:29:29.850 --> 04:29:32.091]  It's June 9th today.
[04:29:32.091 --> 04:29:33.911]  Have you ever thought about whether to have a child?
[04:29:33.911 --> 04:29:36.031]  If so, what factors entered your decision?
[04:29:36.031 --> 04:29:37.772]  Was it whether having children would be good for you?
[04:29:37.772 --> 04:29:38.312]  And it goes on.
[04:29:41.221 --> 04:29:42.582]  Let the state be your mommy.
[04:29:42.582 --> 04:29:43.563]  We'll take care of you.
[04:29:43.563 --> 04:29:46.524]  We'll euthanize your butt.
[04:29:46.524 --> 04:29:52.648]  And it continues here.
[04:29:52.648 --> 04:29:53.449]  And it goes on.
[04:29:53.449 --> 04:29:58.072]  The tales that come out of Alex Jones' websites are stories that
[04:29:59.249 --> 04:30:00.890]  Identify real enemies.
[04:30:00.890 --> 04:30:01.750]  The government.
[04:30:01.750 --> 04:30:03.051]  Law enforcement.
[04:30:03.051 --> 04:30:05.872]  There are a whole set of evil agents out there.
[04:30:05.872 --> 04:30:07.813]  What does ADL, Southern Property Law Center, do?
[04:30:07.813 --> 04:30:09.754]  Every publication is, get Alex Jones.
[04:30:09.754 --> 04:30:10.855]  He wants to kill cops.
[04:30:10.855 --> 04:30:12.696]  Get him, get him, get him, get him.
[04:30:12.696 --> 04:30:14.757]  Get him, get him, get him, get him, get him.
[04:30:15.257 --> 04:30:20.521]  I mean, they are really trying to hype themselves up because they're a bunch of American-hating, free-speech-hating people.
[04:30:20.521 --> 04:30:23.403]  They're all just jumping up and down, going, we're gonna get your free speech!
[04:30:23.403 --> 04:30:24.323]  We're gonna arrest you!
[04:30:24.323 --> 04:30:26.045]  We're gonna take over talk radio!
[04:30:26.045 --> 04:30:27.686]  We're gonna get the Internet!
[04:30:27.686 --> 04:30:30.788]  I mean, they're just jumping up and down.
[04:30:30.788 --> 04:30:31.749]  They just can't wait.
[04:30:32.409 --> 04:30:35.130]  And they're just, oh, he wants to kill cops.
[04:30:35.130 --> 04:30:35.871]  He wants to get them.
[04:30:35.871 --> 04:30:36.931]  Get him, get him.
[04:30:36.931 --> 04:30:38.472]  He wants to kill IRS agents.
[04:30:38.472 --> 04:30:40.933]  You've seen that in the news over and over again.
[04:30:40.933 --> 04:30:45.035]  He was happy when the plane flew in to Austin, the statesman said.
[04:30:45.035 --> 04:30:45.755]  Totally untrue.
[04:30:49.409 --> 04:30:52.151]  I was in studio one hour and five minutes.
[04:30:52.151 --> 04:30:54.872]  It happened about one hour and five minutes before I was live on air.
[04:30:54.872 --> 04:30:56.733]  And I said, they're going to blame it on me.
[04:30:56.733 --> 04:30:59.414]  And this is a horrible act and probably staged.
[04:30:59.414 --> 04:31:00.655]  And we don't need violence.
[04:31:00.655 --> 04:31:08.900]  And one hour after that, about two hours later from the event, it's in the Statesman implying that I was praising it.
[04:31:08.900 --> 04:31:11.141]  And then New York Daily News that afternoon.
[04:31:11.141 --> 04:31:13.282]  I mean, I know these people, folks.
[04:31:13.282 --> 04:31:14.262]  Who are they going to?
[04:31:14.262 --> 04:31:18.245]  I've got David Frum suddenly admitting he's gone to Bilderberg group meetings.
[04:31:19.125 --> 04:31:21.347]  This is the guy who wrote Bush's biography.
[04:31:21.347 --> 04:31:23.709]  This is the guy who wrote Axis of Evil.
[04:31:23.709 --> 04:31:40.664]  He is now writing pieces on a weekly basis demonizing me, and Ron Paul, and Rand Paul, saying we're these dangerous enemies, implying we're calling for violence and danger, and then he brags in yesterday's National Post of Canada that he went to Bilderberg and loves it.
[04:31:40.664 --> 04:31:44.608]  So, I mean, you understand the point I've gotten to?
[04:31:44.608 --> 04:31:45.769]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[04:31:48.171 --> 04:31:49.532]  Now here's the key.
[04:31:49.532 --> 04:31:54.876]  These tall tales that come out of Alex Jones' websites are stories that identify real enemies.
[04:31:54.876 --> 04:31:58.758]  Yeah, your city health department putting sodium fluoride in the water that's got a skull and gross bones on it.
[04:31:58.758 --> 04:32:02.601]  I say take our cities back to the electoral process and take the damn stuff out.
[04:32:02.601 --> 04:32:03.682]  Is that violent?
[04:32:03.682 --> 04:32:06.984]  That I don't want to be self-medicated by you control freaks?
[04:32:06.984 --> 04:32:09.566]  Because you can't deal with us on an equal playing field?
[04:32:11.340 --> 04:32:14.642]  The tales that come out of Alex Jones' websites are stories that identify real enemies.
[04:32:14.642 --> 04:32:16.483]  The government, law enforcement.
[04:32:16.483 --> 04:32:18.744]  There are a whole set of evil agents out there.
[04:32:18.744 --> 04:32:21.346]  Oh no, government didn't kill 200 million people last century.
[04:32:21.346 --> 04:32:29.791]  And though I don't expect to see Alex Jones taking a shot at them anytime soon, this is Chris Matthews, there are people out there who are perfectly willing to do exactly that.
[04:32:33.334 --> 04:32:49.024]  Alex is about to read a big stack of mainstream news and government documents and major university studies about how fluoride attacks your entire system and is linked to brain damage, lower IQ and sterility.
[04:32:49.024 --> 04:32:59.651]  Alex reads mainstream studies where the different GMO corn and soybean within three generations are sterilizing 98% of the gerbils and causing all sorts of deformities.
[04:33:01.152 --> 04:33:02.013]  Uh-oh!
[04:33:02.013 --> 04:33:03.434]  Uh-oh!
[04:33:03.434 --> 04:33:05.236]  Ooh, cop killin'!
[04:33:05.236 --> 04:33:06.397]  Cop killin'!
[04:33:06.397 --> 04:33:08.578]  I'm gonna tell the public they're drinkin' poison!
[04:33:08.578 --> 04:33:09.639]  Must be a cop killer!
[04:33:09.639 --> 04:33:12.281]  I'm gonna tell all those cops to stop drinkin' poison!
[04:33:12.281 --> 04:33:13.242]  Stop havin' their kids!
[04:33:13.242 --> 04:33:15.724]  Ooh, it's cop killin'!
[04:33:15.724 --> 04:33:19.467]  What in the hell does that have to do with cop killin'?
[04:33:19.467 --> 04:33:21.529]  No, they're scared, we're reaching out to the police.
[04:33:23.100 --> 04:33:24.741]  That mean they can't hype them up to frame me?
[04:33:24.741 --> 04:33:26.302]  And hey, you want to make me a martyr?
[04:33:26.302 --> 04:33:27.283]  Knock yourself out.
[04:33:27.283 --> 04:33:31.245]  I want to live a long, good life, but I'm not scared of you and you don't intimidate me.
[04:33:31.245 --> 04:33:34.087]  You show yourselves as a pack of dangerous crooks.
[04:33:34.087 --> 04:33:39.171]  Because what matters here isn't that you have a dwindling audience and are pathetic and exposed.
[04:33:39.171 --> 04:33:45.775]  You still do represent, and that's why you're on a power trip, globalists who killed over a million Iraqis because they wanted some oil and weapon sales.
[04:33:45.775 --> 04:33:47.636]  And so we know you work for the heavy hitters.
[04:33:47.636 --> 04:33:48.937]  We know.
[04:33:48.937 --> 04:33:49.858]  We know you're scum.
[04:33:49.858 --> 04:33:51.198]  Believe me.
[04:33:51.198 --> 04:33:51.779]  Continuing.
[04:33:53.258 --> 04:33:56.200]  You think it intimidates us that you're a bunch of crooks?
[04:33:56.200 --> 04:33:58.701]  That it intimidates us that you support mass murderers?
[04:33:58.701 --> 04:34:01.822]  You think it intimidates us that you're a bunch of limousine liberals?
[04:34:01.822 --> 04:34:04.244]  You think it intimidates us that you're a bunch of eugenicists?
[04:34:04.244 --> 04:34:06.105]  You think we're scared of you?
[04:34:06.105 --> 04:34:09.206]  I'm not going to roll over like a sheep and you're a wolf so you can tear my guts out.
[04:34:09.206 --> 04:34:13.268]  I'm going to fight you in the info war using info weapons and I'm going to crush you.
[04:34:13.268 --> 04:34:14.769]  And that's why you want to get physical.
[04:34:14.769 --> 04:34:16.730]  That's why you want to bring up physical confrontation.
[04:34:16.730 --> 04:34:20.832]  Because you're scared to death because you deep down know what type of cowardly sellout filth you are.
[04:34:22.967 --> 04:34:26.768]  These tales that come out of Alex Jones' websites are stories that identify real enemies.
[04:34:26.768 --> 04:34:28.389]  The government, law enforcement.
[04:34:28.389 --> 04:34:31.129]  There are a whole set of evil agents out there.
[04:34:31.129 --> 04:34:39.392]  And though I don't expect to see Alex Jones taking a shot at them anytime soon, there are people out there who are perfectly willing to do exactly that.
[04:34:39.392 --> 04:34:41.212]  Cuts to Alex Jones.
[04:34:41.212 --> 04:34:50.695]  The system from all their preparations and all their statements actually wants to become violent and wants to use that as an excuse to clamp down and have a real police state in America.
[04:34:52.483 --> 04:34:54.144]  And that's when the revolt starts.
[04:34:54.144 --> 04:34:55.925]  Of course, these are cuts.
[04:34:55.925 --> 04:35:00.747]  I explained we don't want it to go to that and told the government not to do it, but they were asking me, when will there be violence?
[04:35:00.747 --> 04:35:02.407]  And I said, well, this is some of the scenarios.
[04:35:02.407 --> 04:35:06.349]  But then they cut it together to sound like I'm calling for it, see?
[04:35:06.349 --> 04:35:08.150]  And that's when the revolution starts.
[04:35:08.150 --> 04:35:15.153]  That's when people are just gonna say, okay, you stop me at a checkpoint, the government's being abusive, lock and load.
[04:35:15.153 --> 04:35:15.513]  See?
[04:35:15.513 --> 04:35:17.013]  Total cutting, total trimming.
[04:35:17.013 --> 04:35:17.654]  Jones also
[04:35:18.877 --> 04:35:22.200]  One of the leading figures in the 9-11 truther movement claiming that the U.S.
[04:35:22.200 --> 04:35:25.382]  government was behind the terrorist attacks in the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
[04:35:25.382 --> 04:35:28.985]  He maintains that he's neither part of the far right nor the left.
[04:35:30.077 --> 04:35:35.500]  Equally opposing both sides of the political spectrum, but he... No, they don't explain that the spectrum's fake.
[04:35:35.500 --> 04:35:40.923]  It's fake, is what I said, a false system to limit debate and to divide us.
[04:35:40.923 --> 04:35:43.905]  It's the, oh, I don't... I hate all you!
[04:35:43.905 --> 04:35:45.746]  I hate Republicans and Democrats.
[04:35:45.746 --> 04:35:56.492]  No, I'm saying that's a diversion to put you in a fake tribal camp to control your mind, because you like Pepsi, Coke, Ford, Chevy, Redskins, Cowboys.
[04:35:56.492 --> 04:35:58.112]  You're designed to pick a tribe.
[04:35:58.112 --> 04:35:58.733]  This is fake!
[04:36:00.270 --> 04:36:08.799]  He maintains that he's neither far-right nor far-left, equally opposing both sides of the political spectrum, but he certainly appeals to the anti-government elements of the New Right.
[04:36:08.799 --> 04:36:09.980]  I appeal to populists.
[04:36:09.980 --> 04:36:12.222]  I appeal to people that are sick of being raped.
[04:36:12.222 --> 04:36:18.708]  I appeal to liberals when Bush was in because they thought I was a socialist or something because I didn't like tyranny.
[04:36:18.708 --> 04:36:21.251]  And now they think I'm right-wing because I don't like tyranny.
[04:36:21.251 --> 04:36:22.973]  It's the same thing if you figure that out.
[04:36:23.473 --> 04:36:25.234]  And yes, people are figuring that out.
[04:36:25.234 --> 04:36:26.735]  And here's the good news.
[04:36:26.735 --> 04:36:44.467]  You know, when they put out a race-baiting, racial-division trailer for the movie Machete, and I was sent the script, and I talked to Hispanic members of his crew that were upset about it, and now Rodriguez says he's pulling the race-war stuff out of his film, I was contacted by his crew who was concerned, who understand, who are smart.
[04:36:44.467 --> 04:36:46.229]  I was contacted by Matthew's crew.
[04:36:47.202 --> 04:36:49.363]  They are upset about this.
[04:36:49.363 --> 04:36:51.884]  They know this is pure Nazi propaganda.
[04:36:51.884 --> 04:36:53.804]  You talk about Nazi propaganda.
[04:36:53.804 --> 04:36:57.946]  The Nazis were like, these communists and Jews and other gribs are getting violent.
[04:36:57.946 --> 04:36:59.006]  They're causing problems.
[04:36:59.006 --> 04:37:00.146]  We've got to arrest them.
[04:37:00.146 --> 04:37:02.067]  They're, you know, they're arming themselves.
[04:37:02.067 --> 04:37:08.769]  This, if you want to talk about Nazi, it's what Chris Matthews is doing, using racial politics.
[04:37:08.769 --> 04:37:09.970]  Oh, you don't like socialist health care?
[04:37:09.970 --> 04:37:10.970]  You don't like government health care?
[04:37:10.970 --> 04:37:11.831]  You're a racist.
[04:37:11.831 --> 04:37:12.811]  Hitler used race.
[04:37:14.042 --> 04:37:18.003]  By saying racist groups were against the German people.
[04:37:18.003 --> 04:37:19.823]  See?
[04:37:19.823 --> 04:37:21.424]  It's hidden right in front of you, folks.
[04:37:21.424 --> 04:37:26.305]  The mustache belongs on Chris Matthews.
[04:37:26.305 --> 04:37:27.645]  Jones is also one of the leading figures.
[04:37:27.645 --> 04:37:28.325]  He goes on.
[04:37:28.325 --> 04:37:31.586]  He maintains that he's neither left or right, and he goes on.
[04:37:31.586 --> 04:37:37.267]  Big government kills, big government enslaves, big government destroys, and big government annihilates the individual.
[04:37:37.267 --> 04:37:41.708]  Well, that's what George Orwell and Thomas Jefferson said, but, again, I'm a bad guy.
[04:37:41.708 --> 04:37:42.488]  It's extreme talk.
[04:37:43.322 --> 04:37:48.003]  But is it that different from the Tea Parties and the politicians rallying against big government?
[04:37:48.003 --> 04:38:00.447]  So it's also to drive a wedge so that mainline Tea Party goes, this is what Mancow was saying this morning, playing the left-right role that I guess he's meant to play, you know, Alex being used in a trap to discredit the Tea Parties.
[04:38:00.447 --> 04:38:02.587]  And I came back at him and I said, oh really?
[04:38:02.587 --> 04:38:04.348]  Rand Paul's approval rating went up.
[04:38:04.348 --> 04:38:07.969]  Just three weeks ago, the Republicans were trying to throw him under the bus saying he was hurting the Republicans.
[04:38:08.869 --> 04:38:11.650]  Buying the Democrat propaganda when his poll numbers went up.
[04:38:11.650 --> 04:38:13.430]  Stop being a bunch of cowards.
[04:38:13.430 --> 04:38:19.932]  It's the Republicans and Democrats trying to keep everybody on the same political reservation.
[04:38:19.932 --> 04:38:20.393]  No.
[04:38:20.393 --> 04:38:29.475]  When Chris Matthews comes out and says, I claim I have millions of YouTube views, I'm going to expose that was a lie.
[04:38:29.475 --> 04:38:31.796]  That I showed them the millions of views.
[04:38:31.796 --> 04:38:33.897]  The hundreds of millions.
[04:38:33.897 --> 04:38:34.557]  Or attempted to.
[04:38:34.557 --> 04:38:36.478]  They didn't want to see it.
[04:38:36.478 --> 04:38:37.578]  That's lying by omission.
[04:38:38.658 --> 04:38:40.600]  Again, they're going to discredit themselves.
[04:38:40.600 --> 04:38:44.262]  Let them arrogantly bleed out politically on us.
[04:38:44.262 --> 04:38:46.304]  Oh, there's RushLimbaugh.com.
[04:38:46.304 --> 04:38:48.065]  There's Infowars.com.
[04:38:48.065 --> 04:38:51.668]  You can see it well above.
[04:38:51.668 --> 04:38:56.832]  Glenn Beck is in gold and Limbaugh's in red at Alexa.com.
[04:38:56.832 --> 04:38:59.374]  Oh, look at Infowars.
[04:38:59.374 --> 04:39:06.679]  And if you look at that gauge, that is thousands of points ahead of Limbaugh and Beck.
[04:39:09.778 --> 04:39:12.059]  Isn't that interesting?
[04:39:12.059 --> 04:39:15.001]  Isn't that just special?
[04:39:15.001 --> 04:39:17.302]  Alex claims he has millions of listeners.
[04:39:17.302 --> 04:39:18.682]  Really, I claim it.
[04:39:18.682 --> 04:39:19.883]  Hmm.
[04:39:19.883 --> 04:39:22.724]  Well, there's one of the biggest independent rating services out there.
[04:39:22.724 --> 04:39:24.225]  What's that look like?
[04:39:24.225 --> 04:39:29.687]  Rush Limbaugh with 22 million listeners, Glenn Beck with 18 million, and look at InfoWars.com.
[04:39:29.687 --> 04:39:31.768]  But let's put PrisonPlanet.com in.
[04:39:31.768 --> 04:39:38.592]  Let's show PrisonPlanet.com as the fourth one there, because I don't just have one site dwarfing them, I have two!
[04:39:38.592 --> 04:39:38.872]  I have
[04:39:40.404 --> 04:39:46.530]  Just one?
[04:39:46.530 --> 04:39:47.911]  Oh, Prison Planet.
[04:39:47.911 --> 04:39:50.193]  Looks like it's been growing a bit.
[04:39:50.193 --> 04:39:53.776]  It was neck and neck with Limbaugh, but oh!
[04:39:53.776 --> 04:39:55.078]  Oh, moving on up.
[04:39:55.078 --> 04:39:56.199]  Look at that growth curve.
[04:39:56.199 --> 04:39:58.581]  You think they like that?
[04:39:58.581 --> 04:40:02.464]  You wonder why they've got Bilderberg group members like Frum coming in and at me?
[04:40:02.464 --> 04:40:04.586]  One of the top globalist policy writers?
[04:40:05.606 --> 04:40:06.867]  Attacking me on a weekly basis?
[04:40:06.867 --> 04:40:10.268]  You wonder why I've got literally Darth Vader on my tail shooting at me?
[04:40:10.268 --> 04:40:14.630]  Because I know where the Death Star exhaust ports are, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:40:14.630 --> 04:40:16.751]  And I'm not using the computer.
[04:40:16.751 --> 04:40:18.011]  You understand that?
[04:40:18.011 --> 04:40:24.114]  And I'm teaching people how to politically blow the New World Order to hell without a single shot being fired.
[04:40:24.114 --> 04:40:29.256]  But they're going to throw a fit and overturn the chessboard and say, Alex Jones is a cop killer!
[04:40:29.256 --> 04:40:30.417]  Get him!
[04:40:30.417 --> 04:40:30.997]  Get him!
[04:40:33.817 --> 04:40:36.800]  Yeah, well, if you do get me, these are going to be some mighty popular videos.
[04:40:36.800 --> 04:40:38.842]  Oh, but you're planning to shut the web down.
[04:40:38.842 --> 04:40:39.963]  You've been announcing it.
[04:40:39.963 --> 04:40:43.647]  You want to shut the media down so you can murder some Americans, don't you?
[04:40:43.647 --> 04:40:47.751]  You got Homeland Security set up and trained for rendition and torture.
[04:40:47.751 --> 04:40:55.799]  You think you got us where you want us, and you're licking your greasy, fat lips, Chris Matthews.
[04:40:55.799 --> 04:40:56.920]  You like it.
[04:40:56.920 --> 04:40:57.581]  You'd love it.
[04:41:01.451 --> 04:41:03.213]  And it just goes on demonizing me.
[04:41:03.213 --> 04:41:09.758]  So, uh, you can read the whole script and get it out there to everybody and you can understand what's going on.
[04:41:09.758 --> 04:41:10.879]  I want to shift gears now.
[04:41:10.879 --> 04:41:13.201]  We're going to do squid billies.
[04:41:13.201 --> 04:41:14.863]  You guys ready?
[04:41:14.863 --> 04:41:16.404]  Hell, you're not getting an extra 30 minutes.
[04:41:16.404 --> 04:41:19.026]  You're running an extra couple of hours of overdrive here.
[04:41:19.026 --> 04:41:21.969]  How's that sound?
[04:41:21.969 --> 04:41:24.090]  You boys didn't think you were going anywhere today, did you?
[04:41:24.090 --> 04:41:26.372]  Maybe I'll do a 24 hour filibuster here.
[04:41:26.372 --> 04:41:27.894]  No, no, seriously.
[04:41:27.894 --> 04:41:27.994]  Um,
[04:41:33.109 --> 04:41:45.597]  I don't watch a lot of television, but when I buy a DVD like Hurt Locker or Iron Man, it is all government propaganda placement, or behavior placement as they call it, everywhere.
[04:41:45.597 --> 04:41:55.243]  It is all brainwashing, it is all conditioning, anti-family, anti-gun, anti-patriot, pro-war, anti-homeschooling, it's just everywhere.
[04:41:56.972 --> 04:42:03.718]  And it's now admitted that tens of billions a year are paid to networks on cable and TV for the messages in them.
[04:42:03.718 --> 04:42:11.284]  I mean, when you're watching a sitcom and they're driving to mama's house and you see a Join the National Guard billboard, that was paid for.
[04:42:11.284 --> 04:42:13.946]  When you see a bottle of Coca-Cola, that was paid for.
[04:42:13.946 --> 04:42:20.932]  When you see a statement about how great abortion is and how anybody that doesn't want to take vaccines is an evil racist.
[04:42:20.932 --> 04:42:25.316]  And episode after episode, child abusers, child kidnappers,
[04:42:26.522 --> 04:42:27.843]  Are against vaccines.
[04:42:27.843 --> 04:42:31.627]  The show will start with a landlord talking to the cop at the coffee shop.
[04:42:31.627 --> 04:42:32.888]  Yeah, I got a new tenant.
[04:42:32.888 --> 04:42:34.450]  He was telling me vaccines aren't good.
[04:42:34.450 --> 04:42:35.811]  Really?
[04:42:35.811 --> 04:42:38.094]  45 minutes later in the show, they find dead kids in their house.
[04:42:38.094 --> 04:42:39.375]  They're murdering people.
[04:42:39.375 --> 04:42:46.642]  They have that CSI show where the guy believes in chemtrails and government corruption, and so he wants to release a chemical weapon to murder everyone.
[04:42:46.642 --> 04:42:47.863]  But don't worry, they're stopping.
[04:42:47.863 --> 04:42:48.784]  I mean, it's just...
[04:42:50.286 --> 04:43:02.077]  For the jellyfish that sit down, take their Prozac pill, drink their aspartame drink, eat some GMO corn chips, sterilizing them, and all the big studies that have come out.
[04:43:02.077 --> 04:43:08.603]  They're just in suspended disbelief right where the globalists want them, just watching the show with their mouth open.
[04:43:08.603 --> 04:43:14.008]  Their kids are playing video games next to them, learning how to fly predator drones, and all this other stuff's going on.
[04:43:14.008 --> 04:43:15.269]  You ever watch people when they're watching TV?
[04:43:17.597 --> 04:43:20.659]  They eat sterilization chips.
[04:43:20.659 --> 04:43:31.187]  Every major study, they're massively reducing fertility in the first generation, almost complete sterilization by the third generation of every mammal species that they've done tests on.
[04:43:31.187 --> 04:43:38.593]  You're sitting there watching it, and they've got lowest denominator stuff, and so people are just accepting it.
[04:43:38.593 --> 04:43:41.575]  You know, if I re-enlist for a fifth tour, I'm a hero.
[04:43:41.575 --> 04:43:42.555]  That's the moral of
[04:43:43.820 --> 04:43:45.060]  We're good to go.
[04:44:06.468 --> 04:44:06.888]  It is.
[04:44:06.888 --> 04:44:09.389]  Go look up the manufacturing process of aspartame.
[04:44:09.389 --> 04:44:21.493]  Before you sit there and laugh at me because you don't know you're in a scientifically engineered dictatorship and I'm a mad dog patriot who's not domesticated sitting here in a monkey cage trying to warn you.
[04:44:21.493 --> 04:44:24.734]  You're in the monkey cage next to me and I'm like, let's get out of here, brother.
[04:44:24.734 --> 04:44:29.756]  And you're like, I like this television and the poison water feeder they got me.
[04:44:29.756 --> 04:44:30.356]  Like a rabbit.
[04:44:30.356 --> 04:44:32.337]  You know, those little rabbit feeders they've got.
[04:44:34.017 --> 04:44:35.297]  You know, getting your floor on.
[04:44:35.297 --> 04:44:37.318]  Shut up, it's fun.
[04:44:37.318 --> 04:44:40.799]  You know you like it.
[04:44:40.799 --> 04:44:42.179]  I mean, that's what's going on.
[04:44:42.179 --> 04:44:44.460]  Hold on, Chris Matthews is coming on.
[04:44:44.460 --> 04:44:47.561]  He's gonna expose how you're a cop killer.
[04:44:47.561 --> 04:44:49.201]  Here, let's go back to it.
[04:44:49.201 --> 04:44:51.142]  I mean, these people are incredible.
[04:44:54.884 --> 04:45:01.689]  And so every day I'm sent CSI clips and all these other TV shows and dramas.
[04:45:01.689 --> 04:45:06.712]  And every time I'm channel surfing, you know, let's say it's 10 o'clock at night.
[04:45:06.712 --> 04:45:07.793]  Wife and kids are asleep.
[04:45:07.793 --> 04:45:10.174]  I got a radio interview coming up at 11.
[04:45:10.174 --> 04:45:11.615]  I did this last night.
[04:45:11.615 --> 04:45:11.995]  Okay.
[04:45:11.995 --> 04:45:12.876]  I'll watch some television.
[04:45:12.876 --> 04:45:14.697]  I'm sick of surfing the internet.
[04:45:14.697 --> 04:45:16.238]  I haven't watched it in a few weeks.
[04:45:16.238 --> 04:45:18.380]  Maybe I could find a PBS documentary.
[04:45:18.380 --> 04:45:20.241]  So I'm click over.
[04:45:20.241 --> 04:45:22.022]  The whales are all dying.
[04:45:22.022 --> 04:45:24.104]  Only a global government and carbon tax can save them.
[04:45:24.984 --> 04:45:25.424]  We're good to go!
[04:45:55.324 --> 04:46:02.009]  And then a caller calls in a couple days ago, on Monday, and says, I saw squid billies last night.
[04:46:02.009 --> 04:46:03.150]  And I go, what's squid billies?
[04:46:03.150 --> 04:46:04.491]  And they go, well, it's these rednecks.
[04:46:04.491 --> 04:46:10.115]  So again, the stereotypical thing of anybody in the South's a dumb idiot, because they're not domesticated yet, hadn't turned all their guns in yet.
[04:46:10.115 --> 04:46:11.256]  So they're always the demon.
[04:46:11.256 --> 04:46:15.899]  The good, smart people are in Chicago and have been disarmed and are in New York City and have been domesticated.
[04:46:15.899 --> 04:46:17.300]  And they're scared if they see a gun.
[04:46:17.300 --> 04:46:21.463]  But there are these people that know how to catch fish, know how to skin a deer, and do know how to shoot guns.
[04:46:21.463 --> 04:46:23.684]  And they're evil little subhuman squids.
[04:46:24.585 --> 04:46:26.346]  Squids mixed in with humans on the show.
[04:46:26.346 --> 04:46:27.967]  I've now seen it.
[04:46:27.967 --> 04:46:31.569]  The message of, you are subhuman scum.
[04:46:31.569 --> 04:46:34.391]  And they've got different levels of the humanoids down to suboids.
[04:46:34.391 --> 04:46:35.952]  So the message is you're scum.
[04:46:35.952 --> 04:46:40.555]  And there's this evil Rockefeller elitist who you know you hate, but he's the one against fluoride.
[04:46:40.555 --> 04:46:42.396]  So everything's reversed.
[04:46:42.396 --> 04:46:44.577]  And the squids, it's a long program.
[04:46:44.577 --> 04:46:46.679]  I ended up watching most of it.
[04:46:46.679 --> 04:46:49.761]  This is just a few of the lowlights of it.
[04:46:49.761 --> 04:46:51.782]  There's already this toxic waste that everybody's drinking.
[04:46:53.962 --> 04:46:56.545]  So they tell you a truth that the water's full of poison.
[04:46:56.545 --> 04:47:00.630]  And they're defecating and urinating and putting poison in it, but that's not a problem.
[04:47:00.630 --> 04:47:13.545]  The fluoride's good for your teeth, and the degenerate redneck squids, the owner of the town, who owns everything, who basically is, he's a human,
[04:47:16.451 --> 04:47:18.031]  And the only person who's good is the cop.
[04:47:18.031 --> 04:47:23.033]  Of course, the cop actually wears clothes and is a god level, and is about four times bigger than everyone else.
[04:47:23.033 --> 04:47:31.735]  So the archetypal level is, the sweet loving guy is a cop, everyone else is scum, and the average humans who own guns, you aren't even humans, you're a squid.
[04:47:31.735 --> 04:47:32.535]  So there's that message.
[04:47:32.535 --> 04:47:37.096]  I mean, it's just everything is psy-op, brainwashing, everything.
[04:47:37.096 --> 04:47:41.717]  I mean, you watch it, just thousands of data points from my study coming in.
[04:47:41.717 --> 04:47:43.217]  Okay.
[04:47:43.217 --> 04:47:45.138]  And the squids don't want to
[04:47:48.283 --> 04:47:54.806]  Well, they don't care about fluoride, but the billionaire decides to tell them that it is a Barack Hussein Obama plan.
[04:47:54.806 --> 04:48:02.390]  So now if you say his real name, or his full Arabic name, which is really the fake name, you're evil.
[04:48:02.390 --> 04:48:04.551]  So they're inoculating you against that.
[04:48:04.551 --> 04:48:07.952]  There's just so many points here.
[04:48:07.952 --> 04:48:11.654]  And he tells them Barack Hussein Obama wants to shrivel your testicles and sterilize you.
[04:48:13.393 --> 04:48:21.337]  Which in all the studies, it massively reduces the size of your testicles, reduces sperm counts, and attacks every organ in the body.
[04:48:21.337 --> 04:48:26.180]  Doubles bone cancer in men and women, quadruples it in men, young men.
[04:48:26.180 --> 04:48:36.225]  90 plus percent of EPA scientists, I've had them on, their head toxicologists have sent letters saying it's deadly poison.
[04:48:36.225 --> 04:48:39.467]  In some towns when they have droughts, they'll feed tap water to cows.
[04:48:40.626 --> 04:48:44.349]  They'll water them with it, and most of them die within months, all their hair falls out.
[04:48:44.349 --> 04:48:51.776]  In Australia, they've given it to animals at zoos, and they quickly learn to not give them the water, or it kills them.
[04:48:51.776 --> 04:48:55.320]  I mean, you give water to animals that has fluoride, it kills them!
[04:48:58.476 --> 04:48:59.116]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[04:48:59.116 --> 04:49:00.417]  See, I'm a squid.
[04:49:00.417 --> 04:49:02.457]  I'm a subhuman piece of trash.
[04:49:02.457 --> 04:49:08.459]  It doesn't matter if I have this big, giant stack of medical reports and mainstream information I'm about to cover.
[04:49:08.459 --> 04:49:09.000]  It doesn't matter.
[04:49:09.000 --> 04:49:13.181]  The message is, from Dr. Strangelove, is I'm going to nuke the entire world.
[04:49:13.181 --> 04:49:19.923]  I'm Jack T. Ripper, who wants to nuke everybody if I don't want to drink fluoride.
[04:49:19.923 --> 04:49:21.404]  You know, I'm bad.
[04:49:21.404 --> 04:49:23.925]  Look at this Colgate box.
[04:49:23.925 --> 04:49:24.385]  Warnings.
[04:49:24.385 --> 04:49:27.386]  Keep out of reach of children under six years of age.
[04:49:28.266 --> 04:49:44.510]  If more than a pea size is used in brushing or accidentally swallowed, get medical help or contact the Poison Control Center right away.
[04:49:44.510 --> 04:49:47.211]  Here's another one.
[04:49:47.211 --> 04:49:50.932]  But again, I'm a subhuman squid because I can read.
[04:49:50.932 --> 04:49:57.434]  No, the true message is, you are a subhuman squid and we're killing your ass and we're telling you how we're doing it.
[04:49:59.258 --> 04:50:00.019]  Because we're the elite.
[04:50:14.429 --> 04:50:18.775]  is accidentally swallowed, get medical help, or contact a poison control center right away.
[04:50:18.775 --> 04:50:19.736]  How bizarre is this?
[04:50:19.736 --> 04:50:31.591]  There's a typo on the back of this one, and I've read these before, so I just added the part because of the typo, where it said if more than a pea size is ingested, they've taken it out of both Colgate and Crest.
[04:50:32.011 --> 04:50:34.213]  This is a whole other story we just discovered right here.
[04:50:34.213 --> 04:50:36.314]  I told you guys go out and buy me some toothpaste.
[04:50:36.314 --> 04:50:41.538]  It's always said if more than a pea size is ingested, but they don't like people reading the back we've been telling them to.
[04:50:41.538 --> 04:50:54.987]  So suddenly two different companies, two different brands have changed the back to say if more than used for brushing is accidentally swallowed, get medical help or contact poison control right away.
[04:50:56.496 --> 04:50:57.357]  That's a PSYOP.
[04:50:57.357 --> 04:50:58.798]  We just caught him right there.
[04:50:58.798 --> 04:51:01.039]  But I'm not supposed to have analytical thinking skills.
[04:51:01.039 --> 04:51:02.040]  I'm a subhuman squid.
[04:51:02.040 --> 04:51:05.462]  Now, oh, here it is.
[04:51:05.462 --> 04:51:06.383]  It's for children!
[04:51:07.756 --> 04:51:09.856]  Fluoride for children.
[04:51:09.856 --> 04:51:10.997]  You go to the children aisle.
[04:51:10.997 --> 04:51:13.757]  Spring water with added fluoride for children.
[04:51:13.757 --> 04:51:15.317]  Oh look, for your baby.
[04:51:15.317 --> 04:51:19.598]  And I've got all the studies where children ingest fluoride when they're young.
[04:51:19.598 --> 04:51:22.719]  It has many times the effect as when you're adults.
[04:51:22.719 --> 04:51:24.759]  And it says, not sterile.
[04:51:24.759 --> 04:51:30.340]  Use as directed by physician or by label directions for use over an infant.
[04:51:30.340 --> 04:51:34.421]  You've got to have a medicalized medical label on water for your baby.
[04:51:36.002 --> 04:51:36.903]  Added fluoride!
[04:51:36.903 --> 04:51:39.045]  Purified water with fluoride added!
[04:51:39.045 --> 04:51:39.625]  Yum!
[04:51:39.625 --> 04:51:41.927]  Yum!
[04:51:41.927 --> 04:51:42.488]  Oh look!
[04:51:42.488 --> 04:51:44.129]  Get ready to go to school!
[04:51:44.129 --> 04:51:45.591]  Fluorinated spring water!
[04:51:45.591 --> 04:51:48.213]  A big roll out!
[04:51:48.213 --> 04:51:50.735]  A big... and oh!
[04:51:50.735 --> 04:51:51.776]  What are the kids watching?
[04:51:51.776 --> 04:51:53.297]  They're watching the squid show.
[04:51:53.297 --> 04:51:54.058]  The squid bellies.
[04:51:54.058 --> 04:52:02.786]  Let's go ahead and play this total mind control where they then begin shooting the lake that has the fluoride in it with shotguns.
[04:52:04.918 --> 04:52:08.659]  And, uh, all their teeth then fall out because they don't have the fluoride.
[04:52:08.659 --> 04:52:09.339]  Isn't that nice?
[04:52:09.339 --> 04:52:10.400]  Here it is.
[04:52:10.400 --> 04:52:17.562]  No, I'm just performing a routine test of the drinking water.
[04:52:17.562 --> 04:52:21.743]  But boy, that fluoride's just way off.
[04:52:21.743 --> 04:52:23.164]  What's fluoride, sir?
[04:52:23.164 --> 04:52:23.664]  Hey, pause.
[04:52:23.664 --> 04:52:24.704]  Basically.
[04:52:24.704 --> 04:52:26.185]  That's an in-your-face PSYOP.
[04:52:26.185 --> 04:52:29.006]  They, in fact, bring it in to me, the rat poison.
[04:52:29.006 --> 04:52:32.787]  They're throwing rat poison, you know, as the Mickey Mouse hears, into the water.
[04:52:33.931 --> 04:52:36.653]  And the joke is, he says, hmm, I don't see any fluoride.
[04:52:36.653 --> 04:52:45.098]  And the squid throws a big can of rat poison in, when all of the old-fashioned rat poisons, and still some of the new ones, are rat poison.
[04:52:45.098 --> 04:52:46.299]  It says, rat death.
[04:52:46.299 --> 04:52:50.522]  So they're letting you know that they know that fluoride is actually rat poison.
[04:52:50.522 --> 04:52:58.688]  And then on the back of, in fact, Google, uh, rat poison fluoride box, and you can see it, the Deacon and others,
[04:52:59.761 --> 04:53:00.782]  They know!
[04:53:00.782 --> 04:53:04.243]  So they're even saying inside, we know it's rat poison!
[04:53:04.243 --> 04:53:06.845]  You rat scum!
[04:53:06.845 --> 04:53:07.865]  There's too many of you!
[04:53:07.865 --> 04:53:08.746]  You're hurting the earth!
[04:53:08.746 --> 04:53:10.486]  I'm a control freak!
[04:53:10.486 --> 04:53:11.127]  I mean, that's what I mean.
[04:53:11.127 --> 04:53:13.828]  The whole show is just a big, sick joke on everybody.
[04:53:13.828 --> 04:53:14.849]  So there it is.
[04:53:14.849 --> 04:53:15.909]  Oh, a little message.
[04:53:15.909 --> 04:53:17.210]  That's a subliminal.
[04:53:17.210 --> 04:53:19.311]  Oh, rat poison!
[04:53:19.311 --> 04:53:20.772]  There's different types of subliminals.
[04:53:20.772 --> 04:53:24.113]  Not just the quick flash or the, you know, one frame or whatever.
[04:53:24.113 --> 04:53:25.294]  No, no, no.
[04:53:25.294 --> 04:53:28.015]  There's the hidden-in-plain-view subliminal.
[04:53:28.015 --> 04:53:28.375]  Oh, so...
[04:53:30.151 --> 04:53:33.735]  Rat poison, in most major types, is poison.
[04:53:33.735 --> 04:53:35.496]  We always expose it by doing that.
[04:53:35.496 --> 04:53:37.758]  So they're saying, look, we know it's rat poison.
[04:53:37.758 --> 04:53:38.379]  Die!
[04:53:38.379 --> 04:53:39.160]  Die, sucker!
[04:53:39.160 --> 04:53:40.201]  Die!
[04:53:40.201 --> 04:53:41.282]  The earth belongs to us!
[04:53:41.282 --> 04:53:41.782]  Die!
[04:53:41.782 --> 04:53:42.423]  Die!
[04:53:42.423 --> 04:53:43.124]  So let's continue.
[04:53:44.448 --> 04:53:46.169]  What's fluoride, Sheriff?
[04:53:46.169 --> 04:53:49.250]  Well, basically, Rusty, it's steroids for your teeth.
[04:53:49.250 --> 04:53:51.871]  Makes them strong and- Hit pause!
[04:53:51.871 --> 04:53:52.432]  Hit pause.
[04:53:52.432 --> 04:53:53.312]  More lies?
[04:53:53.312 --> 04:53:57.234]  Looks like it'll be a two-part video, because I've already done more than ten minutes.
[04:53:57.234 --> 04:53:59.995]  Total lies!
[04:53:59.995 --> 04:54:08.119]  Just Google, American Dental Association says don't give fluoride to children below six because of dental fluorosis and fractures of the teeth and bones.
[04:54:09.389 --> 04:54:13.952]  It is now not supposed to be given to children, and now they've changed it.
[04:54:13.952 --> 04:54:14.972]  I've got to find an old box.
[04:54:14.972 --> 04:54:19.174]  It used to say, now it doesn't even make sense, if you ingest a pea size, call poison control.
[04:54:19.174 --> 04:54:23.437]  Now it says, if more than used,
[04:54:25.111 --> 04:54:27.212]  They've taken pea-size out.
[04:54:27.212 --> 04:54:33.834]  If more than used for brushing is accidentally swallowed, get medical help or contact a poison control center right away.
[04:54:33.834 --> 04:54:35.814]  Two different brands, Colgate and Crest.
[04:54:35.814 --> 04:54:39.776]  Why am I the only one noticing that they don't have their proper poison control on?
[04:54:39.776 --> 04:54:43.517]  See, they know you're not paying attention, folks, and they just slip it.
[04:54:43.517 --> 04:54:44.657]  Oh, for your children!
[04:54:44.657 --> 04:54:46.478]  Ha!
[04:54:46.478 --> 04:54:47.118]  Oh!
[04:54:47.118 --> 04:54:47.398]  Oh!
[04:54:47.398 --> 04:54:49.338]  No, it's a new water for kids.
[04:54:49.338 --> 04:54:50.299]  Fluoride, Mommy.
[04:54:50.299 --> 04:54:51.039]  Give it to them.
[04:54:51.039 --> 04:54:51.619]  Yes!
[04:54:51.619 --> 04:54:53.300]  You like giving them medicine.
[04:54:53.300 --> 04:54:53.840]  You're like a...
[04:54:54.804 --> 04:55:04.854]  Oh look, I've got Indulge Sweetener Aspartame, the feces of genetically engineered bacteria.
[04:55:04.854 --> 04:55:06.275]  Oh yeah, that's what it is!
[04:55:06.275 --> 04:55:11.881]  And I order a pizza and the little packet of red pepper comes, it says radiated.
[04:55:13.427 --> 04:55:13.967]  Oh, there it is.
[04:55:13.967 --> 04:55:15.548]  Monitoring fluoride in children.
[04:55:15.548 --> 04:55:30.233]  Parents and other caregivers should judicially monitor the use of all fluoride-containing dental products by children younger than six because ingestion of higher than recommended levels of fluoride by children has been associated with an increased risk of very mild to mild permanent discoloration and developing.
[04:55:30.233 --> 04:55:31.054]  Oh, that's a whitewash.
[04:55:31.054 --> 04:55:32.434]  It's far worse than that.
[04:55:32.434 --> 04:55:34.335]  Try to find me the rat poison label.
[04:55:35.802 --> 04:55:38.243]  I'll just Google rat poison label fluoride.
[04:55:38.243 --> 04:55:38.784]  It'll come up.
[04:55:38.784 --> 04:55:40.504]  No, I've got it around here.
[04:55:40.504 --> 04:55:44.206]  And then also you can Google, um, well, it doesn't matter.
[04:55:44.206 --> 04:55:45.247]  Anybody can pull it up who wants to.
[04:55:45.247 --> 04:55:46.588]  Okay, let's continue.
[04:55:46.588 --> 04:55:48.208]  We're only 10 seconds into squid bellies.
[04:55:48.208 --> 04:55:52.591]  This may take hours, but every five seconds is a brainwashing salvo.
[04:55:52.591 --> 04:55:53.111]  Let's continue.
[04:55:53.851 --> 04:55:58.553]  Mr. Halen, are you aware that state law requires you to add one part per million of fluoride?
[04:55:58.553 --> 04:55:59.894]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[04:55:59.894 --> 04:56:06.377]  You've got a master controller, they're also letting you know, who's got a master control computer with every button being a skull.
[04:56:06.377 --> 04:56:09.038]  So he's a killer, he's evil, he's a eugenicist.
[04:56:09.038 --> 04:56:12.020]  And he doesn't want you to have fluoride.
[04:56:12.020 --> 04:56:14.441]  But again, and if you watch it, there's other double messages.
[04:56:16.343 --> 04:56:17.223]  Continue.
[04:56:17.223 --> 04:56:17.643]  Supply.
[04:56:17.643 --> 04:56:21.624]  Yes, well, I'm sure your precious one PPM is in there somewhere.
[04:56:21.624 --> 04:56:22.544]  Check again.
[04:56:22.544 --> 04:56:23.724]  I've checked and double-checked.
[04:56:23.724 --> 04:56:24.144]  Hit pause.
[04:56:24.144 --> 04:56:25.105]  Personally.
[04:56:25.105 --> 04:56:28.345]  Most states do not have a law that you've got to have fluoride.
[04:56:28.345 --> 04:56:33.266]  And what they have is a mandate for federal funds, like, oh, you want highway funds?
[04:56:33.266 --> 04:56:33.286]  55.
[04:56:33.286 --> 04:56:37.287]  Well, I can't drive 55.
[04:56:37.287 --> 04:56:40.347]  One foot on the brake, one foot on the gas.
[04:56:40.347 --> 04:56:41.628]  It's the same thing.
[04:56:41.628 --> 04:56:43.408]  It's a unfunded mandate.
[04:56:44.480 --> 04:56:47.561]  You will put one part per million, or you won't get your money.
[04:56:47.561 --> 04:56:50.682]  You got Edward Zagafor, cleanest water in America in Austin?
[04:56:50.682 --> 04:56:53.523]  We're gonna add a bunch of poison in it at the end of the process.
[04:56:53.523 --> 04:56:54.924]  Let's continue.
[04:56:54.924 --> 04:56:56.404]  Ain't none in there at all.
[04:56:56.404 --> 04:56:58.425]  I'm going to tackle this issue head-on!
[04:56:59.079 --> 04:57:05.681]  Barack Hussein Obama is sneaking fluoride into your drinking water.
[04:57:05.681 --> 04:57:06.962]  They do what?
[04:57:06.962 --> 04:57:07.362]  Fluoride?
[04:57:07.362 --> 04:57:08.882]  That's right, that's right.
[04:57:08.882 --> 04:57:12.864]  The chemical fluoride in your drinking water.
[04:57:12.864 --> 04:57:13.844]  Head pause.
[04:57:13.844 --> 04:57:15.645]  The chemical?
[04:57:15.645 --> 04:57:16.785]  The chemical?
[04:57:16.785 --> 04:57:17.505]  As if.
[04:57:17.505 --> 04:57:21.467]  I mean, fluoride is one of the most deadly chemicals, one of the smallest molecules.
[04:57:21.467 --> 04:57:22.887]  It's a cumulative poison.
[04:57:22.887 --> 04:57:24.408]  Just go research it.
[04:57:24.408 --> 04:57:25.308]  It's admitted.
[04:57:26.479 --> 04:57:29.282]  You give it to farm animals, they die quickly!
[04:57:29.282 --> 04:57:32.965]  You put fish in fluoride water, they'll die!
[04:57:32.965 --> 04:57:34.967]  Goldfish will die!
[04:57:34.967 --> 04:57:36.969]  Fish can't live in it, it's bad!
[04:57:36.969 --> 04:57:45.276]  Barack Hussein Obama wants to shrink your testicles.
[04:57:45.276 --> 04:57:47.018]  See, it's a big joke.
[04:57:47.018 --> 04:57:48.899]  But the idiot squid billies, they listen.
[04:57:48.899 --> 04:57:49.160]  Here we go.
[04:57:50.882 --> 04:57:53.244]  To sterilize your testicles!
[04:57:53.244 --> 04:57:54.726]  We don't need no damn government!
[04:57:54.726 --> 04:57:57.449]  Yours too, ladies!
[04:57:57.449 --> 04:57:58.550]  And pause.
[04:57:58.550 --> 04:58:00.792]  We don't need no damn government!
[04:58:00.792 --> 04:58:08.660]  Now, if you want- don't want them force-medicating you, you don't want no damn government!
[04:58:08.660 --> 04:58:09.401]  See, the message is...
[04:58:11.311 --> 04:58:19.233]  You are totally anti-government and you want zero government if you don't want them putting over 300 chemicals, on average it's about 150.
[04:58:19.233 --> 04:58:21.894]  Under the name fluoride, they can dump a whole bunch of toxic waste.
[04:58:21.894 --> 04:58:28.656]  Where do you think toxic waste from aluminum production, nuclear weapons, fuel rod production, and fertilizer mines comes from?
[04:58:28.656 --> 04:58:32.497]  Austin gets it from a fertilizer mine, the byproduct.
[04:58:33.385 --> 04:58:38.168]  Of the chemical waste, because they mine limestone for the base product for the type we use.
[04:58:38.168 --> 04:58:38.669]  Side issue.
[04:58:38.669 --> 04:58:40.290]  The point is, go do some research.
[04:58:40.290 --> 04:58:42.291]  I don't want no damn government!
[04:58:42.291 --> 04:58:44.873]  I don't want no damn government!
[04:58:44.873 --> 04:58:45.853]  Let's continue.
[04:58:45.853 --> 04:58:50.176]  To abort your thinking, breathing sperm... This is unacceptable!
[04:58:50.176 --> 04:58:51.357]  Pause.
[04:58:51.357 --> 04:58:53.178]  Now... In fact, back it up 20 seconds.
[04:58:53.178 --> 04:58:55.780]  See, now your sperm are thinking and breathing.
[04:58:55.780 --> 04:59:01.944]  They mix real information that it does shrink your testicles, does reduce sperm count, does attack every organ in the body.
[04:59:04.395 --> 04:59:07.237]  On record, how many scientists have we had on?
[04:59:07.237 --> 04:59:08.997]  Head toxicologist, EPA.
[04:59:08.997 --> 04:59:09.778]  They want it out.
[04:59:09.778 --> 04:59:11.239]  Government says no.
[04:59:11.239 --> 04:59:15.781]  But they give you some weird guy with orange hair who's naked up there to discredit it.
[04:59:15.781 --> 04:59:19.823]  But then the cop, he's well-spoken and sweet and has a gun, the symbol of authority.
[04:59:19.823 --> 04:59:22.665]  He's four or five times bigger than everybody else.
[04:59:22.665 --> 04:59:24.545]  The images, he's the mommy.
[04:59:24.545 --> 04:59:25.466]  He's the cop.
[04:59:25.466 --> 04:59:26.967]  He's going to give you the fluoride.
[04:59:26.967 --> 04:59:29.048]  He lovingly helps them keep their teeth at the end.
[04:59:30.382 --> 04:59:32.646]  Everyone's scum but him.
[04:59:32.646 --> 04:59:34.068]  Let's go ahead back to the brainwashing.
[04:59:44.997 --> 04:59:47.618]  You're a subhuman squid if you have a shotgun.
[04:59:47.618 --> 04:59:48.738]  This is domestication.
[05:00:12.120 --> 05:00:21.923]  Imagine, we're pointing out that they're poisoning our water, that brain damages us and reduces fertility, and they've got shows where subhuman squids are running around waving shotguns who are against it.
[05:00:21.923 --> 05:00:24.324]  Oh, you don't want social health care?
[05:00:24.324 --> 05:00:26.064]  You're a racist.
[05:00:26.064 --> 05:00:27.224]  Oh, you don't want world government?
[05:00:27.224 --> 05:00:28.965]  You want to kill cops.
[05:00:28.965 --> 05:00:31.266]  No evidence, they just say it.
[05:00:31.266 --> 05:00:35.147]  Now, does that not tell you how creepy and evil these people are?
[05:00:35.147 --> 05:00:35.647]  Continue.
[05:00:48.463 --> 05:00:55.037]  Well, let's freeze some, and then we can smash it!
[05:00:55.037 --> 05:00:56.880]  Then we'll wait until winter!
[05:01:00.745 --> 05:01:02.046]  I hit pause.
[05:01:02.046 --> 05:01:04.028]  They know the average lazy person.
[05:01:04.028 --> 05:01:05.969]  They've done psychological brain algorithm studies.
[05:01:05.969 --> 05:01:06.830]  This is admitted.
[05:01:06.830 --> 05:01:09.692]  DARPA just, I've been to the UT psychology department.
[05:01:09.692 --> 05:01:12.374]  The vast majority of it is just flicker rates of the eye.
[05:01:12.374 --> 05:01:13.795]  What is interesting to you?
[05:01:13.795 --> 05:01:14.756]  How to make you upset?
[05:01:14.756 --> 05:01:15.797]  How to create a bad response?
[05:01:15.797 --> 05:01:19.940]  And they found with lazy jellyfish, in fact here it is, about me.
[05:01:19.940 --> 05:01:21.021]  All about me.
[05:01:21.021 --> 05:01:23.362]  College kids lack empathy compared to 30 years ago.
[05:01:23.362 --> 05:01:24.703]  It's all about me now.
[05:01:24.703 --> 05:01:26.084]  Which means nobody cares about them.
[05:01:26.084 --> 05:01:27.866]  So you're all alone, isolated.
[05:01:27.866 --> 05:01:30.248]  So the predator class can corner you at their will.
[05:01:31.533 --> 05:01:38.260]  They know no one hates waiting and so that that clicks a nerve in the brain.
[05:01:38.260 --> 05:01:46.348]  Okay, we're going to wait till winter and so the average person then has a subconscious psychological neuron trigger
[05:01:47.169 --> 05:01:51.854]  Uh, in, you know, in their little dreamlike state, watching television, which actually puts you in dreamlike state.
[05:01:51.854 --> 05:01:55.838]  That's on record, more than just a few minutes of people that watch a lot of TV, they go into the dreamlike state.
[05:01:55.838 --> 05:01:57.159]  Notice I'm not in the dreamlike state, folks.
[05:01:57.159 --> 05:01:58.841]  I don't watch much TV.
[05:01:58.841 --> 05:02:00.162]  Uh, you know, this is how you're supposed to work.
[05:02:00.162 --> 05:02:03.065]  You know, fast, intelligent, dynamic, understanding connections.
[05:02:03.065 --> 05:02:03.745]  You're on fluoride.
[05:02:03.745 --> 05:02:04.867]  You watch TV all day.
[05:02:04.867 --> 05:02:05.847]  Four and a half hours on average.
[05:02:07.421 --> 05:02:13.623]  They know that they trigger, oh my God, they're there watching, waiting till winter, this is boring.
[05:02:13.623 --> 05:02:16.183]  And they know watching the show, that makes you hate them.
[05:02:16.183 --> 05:02:22.405]  You want to see the little squids that look subhuman, that make you feel good about yourself, not knowing that the joke's on you, that you're the squid.
[05:02:22.405 --> 05:02:29.187]  You want to see them go do something else stupid, or get hurt, which makes you feel big and powerful over the subhuman squids, which is you, according to the elite.
[05:02:29.187 --> 05:02:30.667]  So the joke's on you on top of it.
[05:02:30.667 --> 05:02:31.988]  Joke's within jokes.
[05:02:31.988 --> 05:02:35.929]  And so, this is all Psych Warfare, Pentagon probably wrote that up.
[05:02:35.929 --> 05:02:36.869]  And so you're there,
[05:02:38.274 --> 05:02:40.715]  And you're watching this and, oh God, they're gonna wait till winter now.
[05:02:40.715 --> 05:02:43.475]  That makes you have disdain for them.
[05:02:43.475 --> 05:02:45.556]  It makes you angry at them.
[05:02:45.556 --> 05:02:47.196]  It makes you not like them.
[05:02:47.196 --> 05:02:48.437]  So you're just taught to hate them.
[05:02:48.437 --> 05:02:50.357]  Just another, every second is programming.
[05:02:50.357 --> 05:02:51.758]  Let's continue.
[05:02:51.758 --> 05:02:54.378]  Global warming and your impact on the environment.
[05:02:54.378 --> 05:02:56.039]  All right, hit pause.
[05:02:56.039 --> 05:02:57.079]  Again, back it up.
[05:02:57.079 --> 05:03:02.201]  Every two, three seconds is just the, and this goes on for 30 minutes, okay?
[05:03:02.201 --> 05:03:07.502]  He's hitting the water because global warming.
[05:03:11.300 --> 05:03:14.802]  I mean, again, just selling global warming.
[05:03:14.802 --> 05:03:17.344]  It is just, it is total mind control.
[05:03:17.344 --> 05:03:17.925]  Continue.
[05:03:17.925 --> 05:03:21.007]  Hey, you do know that fluoride's already out of the water, don't you?
[05:03:21.007 --> 05:03:22.488]  Well, that might be true.
[05:03:22.488 --> 05:03:23.068]  Yeah.
[05:03:23.068 --> 05:03:23.388]  Hey, Daddy?
[05:03:23.388 --> 05:03:25.790]  My teeth are getting all loosey-loosey.
[05:03:25.790 --> 05:03:28.152]  They're moving around in my mouth and everything.
[05:03:28.152 --> 05:03:29.733]  Collect the teeth, boy.
[05:03:29.733 --> 05:03:31.354]  We're gonna mail them to Washington.
[05:03:31.354 --> 05:03:32.455]  Send a message.
[05:03:32.455 --> 05:03:33.815]  And just what would that message be?
[05:03:33.815 --> 05:03:33.936]  Pause.
[05:03:34.696 --> 05:03:36.798]  We're going down to Washington, send a message.
[05:03:36.798 --> 05:03:42.762]  You're toothless, scum, Southern American jellyfish who wants to go to Washington.
[05:03:42.762 --> 05:03:46.685]  Being involved means you have no teeth and are scum.
[05:03:46.685 --> 05:03:53.070]  And the cop's looking over him lovingly, he's got his teeth, and he's saying, why would you want to do that?
[05:03:53.070 --> 05:03:55.752]  Again, back it up to the earlier global warming part.
[05:03:55.752 --> 05:03:57.393]  Back it up about 20 seconds here.
[05:03:57.393 --> 05:03:59.895]  Just again, every three, four seconds, total programming.
[05:03:59.895 --> 05:04:00.936]  Continue.
[05:04:00.936 --> 05:04:04.379]  Damn you, global warming and your impact on the environment.
[05:04:06.010 --> 05:04:09.592]  Early... You do know that fluoride's already out of the water, don't you?
[05:04:09.592 --> 05:04:10.953]  Well, that might be true.
[05:04:10.953 --> 05:04:11.533]  Yeah.
[05:04:11.533 --> 05:04:12.254]  Hey, Daddy?
[05:04:12.254 --> 05:04:14.255]  My teeth are getting all loosey-loosey.
[05:04:14.255 --> 05:04:16.656]  They're moving around in my mouth and everything.
[05:04:16.656 --> 05:04:18.197]  Collect the teeth, boy.
[05:04:18.197 --> 05:04:19.618]  We're gonna mail them to Washington.
[05:04:19.618 --> 05:04:20.919]  Send a message.
[05:04:20.919 --> 05:04:24.481]  And just what would that message be?
[05:04:24.481 --> 05:04:32.386]  That... That... That we gonna... That... That we don't gotta... That... Well... That we... We ain't got no damn teeth no more!
[05:04:32.386 --> 05:04:34.107]  Hey, pause.
[05:04:34.107 --> 05:04:34.327]  So...
[05:04:35.885 --> 05:04:43.689]  The Tea Party isn't, you know, mad about the bankers, or Obama spending more money than all presidents before him combined, or the economy falling apart.
[05:04:43.689 --> 05:04:46.350]  No, you don't have any real reasons to complain.
[05:04:46.350 --> 05:04:51.212]  You toothless, jellyfish piece of subhuman trash.
[05:04:51.212 --> 05:04:55.774]  And now you're going to complain because you didn't do what the government said and drink your fluoride.
[05:04:55.774 --> 05:04:56.835]  You are scum.
[05:04:56.835 --> 05:04:57.215]  Here it is.
[05:04:58.727 --> 05:05:04.951]  You, sir, need a pair of our finest injection-molded canine-enhanced jawbone snappers.
[05:05:04.951 --> 05:05:06.372]  Hit pause.
[05:05:06.372 --> 05:05:10.835]  Again, the top Rockefeller globalist who scams everyone.
[05:05:10.835 --> 05:05:12.096]  Everyone's teeth have fallen out.
[05:05:12.096 --> 05:05:17.420]  Now he's gonna sell them the prosthesis, the dentures, which is what the globalists actually do.
[05:05:17.420 --> 05:05:20.622]  They put the cancer viruses in your vaccine on record.
[05:05:20.622 --> 05:05:24.545]  They've got the new pig cancer virus in there for your kids, and they've approved that in your shots.
[05:05:24.545 --> 05:05:27.407]  That's in the news, and they say it's good to kill your kids and hurt them.
[05:05:28.396 --> 05:05:32.459]  And the Gardasil's killing kids and doesn't protect you against the papillomavirus, but that's okay as well.
[05:05:32.459 --> 05:05:34.221]  They're gonna sell you the chemotherapy!
[05:05:34.221 --> 05:05:41.807]  It's just all letting them, you know, the writers of this show want you to know, we understand it all, and we hate your guts.
[05:05:41.807 --> 05:05:46.471]  And they're saying, Alex Jones, you redneck piece of crap, we're gonna get your ass in the end.
[05:05:46.471 --> 05:05:50.955]  We're gonna win, we're cold-blooded, we're going the long march, and we got your ass.
[05:05:50.955 --> 05:05:51.596]  You understand?
[05:05:51.596 --> 05:05:51.976]  Here it is.
[05:05:52.236 --> 05:05:53.156]  Try them.
[05:05:53.156 --> 05:05:54.277]  Now get out!
[05:05:54.277 --> 05:06:00.880]  And tell your friends if they ever want to chew again, they need to come to me.
[05:06:00.880 --> 05:06:04.221]  Hey, my daddy, why'd you give them hard-shell tacos?
[05:06:04.221 --> 05:06:09.024]  Well, these taco shards aren't gonna feel too damn good going down.
[05:06:09.024 --> 05:06:10.244]  Here we go.
[05:06:10.244 --> 05:06:11.245]  Fine chips.
[05:06:11.245 --> 05:06:14.846]  Good as teeth.
[05:06:14.846 --> 05:06:15.266]  Oww!
[05:06:15.266 --> 05:06:19.008]  Dammit!
[05:06:19.008 --> 05:06:19.748]  Woman!
[05:06:19.748 --> 05:06:20.929]  Face me, them dentures!
[05:06:23.667 --> 05:06:24.828]  No.
[05:06:24.828 --> 05:06:28.830]  Patron of all people.
[05:06:28.830 --> 05:06:31.332]  Patron of elders.
[05:06:31.332 --> 05:06:32.173]  Oh, but good officer.
[05:06:32.173 --> 05:06:36.075]  Gets between the family.
[05:06:36.075 --> 05:06:37.076]  Rewind it again.
[05:06:44.039 --> 05:06:45.359]  This is key.
[05:06:45.359 --> 05:06:50.421]  Now, here you see the police officer and he's got the fluoride.
[05:06:50.421 --> 05:06:52.621]  He knows better than your dad.
[05:06:52.621 --> 05:06:53.642]  Just like the schools.
[05:06:53.642 --> 05:06:59.343]  I've got Time magazine for kids five years ago saying, your parents are part of an old foolish age.
[05:06:59.343 --> 05:07:02.004]  You can pull up the actual quotes, it's even worse.
[05:07:02.004 --> 05:07:04.724]  And they don't understand that you'll all have implantable microchips.
[05:07:04.724 --> 05:07:06.825]  You belong to a new wonderful future.
[05:07:06.825 --> 05:07:08.365]  It's like sarcastic.
[05:07:08.365 --> 05:07:10.106]  It's absurdist over the top.
[05:07:11.345 --> 05:07:13.688]  I saw a CNN clip yesterday.
[05:07:13.688 --> 05:07:18.873]  We may put a clip up in the film where they're like, it's good to have the government secretly take your child's blood at birth.
[05:07:18.873 --> 05:07:20.615]  Only extremists don't like it.
[05:07:20.615 --> 05:07:22.517]  See, it's just more and more crazy.
[05:07:22.517 --> 05:07:24.440]  Yeah, we're recording your naked bodies at the airport.
[05:07:24.440 --> 05:07:26.221]  What's wrong with that?
[05:07:26.221 --> 05:07:28.003]  You don't like it?
[05:07:28.003 --> 05:07:31.627]  So again, the good officer comes out and they try to steal his one little tooth.
[05:07:32.600 --> 05:07:34.701]  I like the way the tiny food bits mix with my spit.
[05:07:58.004 --> 05:08:01.508]  Hey, Rusty, over here.
[05:08:01.508 --> 05:08:04.010]  I smuggled this in for you, so brush up.
[05:08:04.010 --> 05:08:06.232]  Me and the boys will keep a lookout for the gummies.
[05:08:06.232 --> 05:08:08.875]  Ah-ha, you sneaky devils!
[05:08:08.875 --> 05:08:10.797]  Goons, search their lips!
[05:08:10.797 --> 05:08:11.177]  No!
[05:08:11.177 --> 05:08:11.358]  No!
[05:08:11.358 --> 05:08:13.360]  I will never be like you!
[05:08:13.360 --> 05:08:14.000]  I want a tear!
[05:08:14.000 --> 05:08:14.861]  I want a tear!
[05:08:14.861 --> 05:08:15.402]  Head pause.
[05:08:16.710 --> 05:08:24.678]  So the cop secretly gets the kid under his control, but then they want to pull his tooth out, and then the local Rockefeller comes with vigilantes.
[05:08:24.678 --> 05:08:26.941]  Now Rockefeller would come with the cops.
[05:08:26.941 --> 05:08:32.446]  He wouldn't come with vigilantes to burn them at the stake because they like fluoride.
[05:08:33.067 --> 05:08:35.789]  So now you're the rebel if you want fluoride.
[05:08:35.789 --> 05:08:44.637]  No, it's the government, the military-industrial complex, putting it in there, and it's in a Pulitzer Prize-winning book, written by a Pulitzer Prize-winning author, I.G.
[05:08:44.637 --> 05:08:53.865]  Farben, Crime and Punishment, who was part of the Nuremberg Trials, that the Nazis learned from the Soviets, when they were allies in the late 30s, how to put it in camp workers' water.
[05:08:53.865 --> 05:08:54.906]  I'm sorry.
[05:08:54.906 --> 05:08:56.026]  It's a fact.
[05:08:56.026 --> 05:08:56.427]  Continue.
[05:08:56.687 --> 05:08:58.328]  What's going on with the mob mentality?
[05:08:58.328 --> 05:08:58.888]  Daddy, help me!
[05:08:58.888 --> 05:09:00.929]  I've told you a thousand times, boy.
[05:09:00.929 --> 05:09:02.309]  Don't never exhale!
[05:09:02.309 --> 05:09:03.430]  No, no, no, no!
[05:09:03.430 --> 05:09:04.370]  Y'all gonna lynch me!
[05:09:04.370 --> 05:09:05.911]  You gonna lynch me!
[05:09:05.911 --> 05:09:06.311]  No!
[05:09:06.311 --> 05:09:12.013]  No!
[05:09:12.013 --> 05:09:13.634]  The prisoners will come with me.
[05:09:14.540 --> 05:09:20.324]  Where I'll administer some torture they can really sink their tooth into.
[05:09:20.324 --> 05:09:22.585]  Please, you have to help me!
[05:09:22.585 --> 05:09:23.766]  What's the matter with you?
[05:09:23.766 --> 05:09:24.767]  You're saving money.
[05:09:24.767 --> 05:09:26.528]  Talk sense into them!
[05:09:26.528 --> 05:09:30.891]  I think I got an idea that'll help you out here, Mr. Hale.
[05:09:30.891 --> 05:09:34.353]  Pre-chewed food!
[05:09:34.353 --> 05:09:39.076]  Now, my idea was to buy everybody a set of dentures.
[05:09:39.076 --> 05:09:40.677]  Yeah, I like my plan better.
[05:09:40.677 --> 05:09:41.258]  Keep chewing.
[05:09:42.583 --> 05:09:53.939]  And in the end, they're gonna take your teeth so that you are dependent on the government and the government will then vomit into your mouth.
[05:09:54.713 --> 05:09:56.114]  That's basically what it is.
[05:09:56.114 --> 05:09:58.817]  I've got the articles right here where they're shutting down the Amish.
[05:09:58.817 --> 05:10:03.020]  New York Times says it's against the environment that the cows are defecating.
[05:10:03.020 --> 05:10:03.921]  Totally normal.
[05:10:03.921 --> 05:10:05.082]  Natural fertilizer.
[05:10:05.082 --> 05:10:08.846]  The Environmental Protection Agency is spending its money on them.
[05:10:08.846 --> 05:10:11.188]  Kind of like I have that article out of Sacramento.
[05:10:11.188 --> 05:10:15.011]  Armed IRS agents visit Car Wash over four cents of unpaid tickets.
[05:10:15.011 --> 05:10:16.973]  They're only allowed to go after poor people.
[05:10:17.233 --> 05:10:24.236]  They'll occasionally bust some Hollywood person for a high-profile thing, but almost all their funding is for poor people or small businesses.
[05:10:24.236 --> 05:10:27.277]  So, they're not worried about Tyson Chicken and all the big agribusiness.
[05:10:27.277 --> 05:10:32.659]  They're going to harass some of the best farms we've got, and they're going to tell you how that's a good thing.
[05:10:32.659 --> 05:10:33.819]  There you go!
[05:10:33.819 --> 05:10:37.001]  Because they're not domesticated.
[05:10:37.001 --> 05:10:40.082]  Now, here's just some of the news articles.
[05:10:40.082 --> 05:10:42.683]  Fluoride behind high rate of bone cancer in dogs.
[05:10:44.716 --> 05:10:49.781]  Second thoughts about fluoride report, Scientific American.
[05:10:49.781 --> 05:10:53.904]  Fluoride in drinking water may negatively affect health of fetus and infants.
[05:10:53.904 --> 05:10:57.727]  Mainline studies.
[05:10:57.727 --> 05:10:58.348]  WebMD.
[05:10:58.348 --> 05:11:02.812]  Does fluoride, fluoridation, up bone cancer risk?
[05:11:02.812 --> 05:11:07.996]  Study examines boyhood drinking of fluoride water and possible links to osteosarcoma.
[05:11:07.996 --> 05:11:10.579]  And then you actually read the study and it says it doubles it.
[05:11:13.068 --> 05:11:15.850]  Fluoride and the impact of the brain.
[05:11:15.850 --> 05:11:16.791]  Chicago Tribune.
[05:11:16.791 --> 05:11:19.033]  Toothpaste chemical raises concerns.
[05:11:19.033 --> 05:11:20.514]  And it goes on to say, read the back.
[05:11:20.514 --> 05:11:21.695]  It says it's poison.
[05:11:21.695 --> 05:11:29.480]  And they say, well, if it's cumulative and fluoride stays in the body like no other chemical known, no other compound, then why is this happening?
[05:11:29.480 --> 05:11:31.662]  Well, suddenly they put gibberish on the back.
[05:11:31.662 --> 05:11:34.304]  I sent them out to buy toothpaste and notice a change in the matrix.
[05:11:37.455 --> 05:11:39.115]  That's a big issue, folks.
[05:11:39.115 --> 05:11:41.656]  The regulators aren't going to do a damn thing about that.
[05:11:41.656 --> 05:11:46.117]  It was helping us that we could say, hey, it says if you eat more than a pea size, call poison control.
[05:11:46.117 --> 05:11:47.718]  People are saying, why am I doing poison?
[05:11:47.718 --> 05:11:49.718]  Well, they just have gibberish on the back now.
[05:11:49.718 --> 05:11:52.139]  They took out the word pea size.
[05:11:52.139 --> 05:11:54.879]  Health effects, fluoride and cancer.
[05:11:54.879 --> 05:12:00.481]  They've got a bunch of documents linked to government reports in Fluoride Action Network Health Effects.
[05:12:00.481 --> 05:12:02.461]  That's a good page to visit.
[05:12:02.461 --> 05:12:04.082]  Scientific study finds fluoride horror
[05:12:05.273 --> 05:12:10.975]  The story's factual, and that's a link out of the Scientific American.
[05:12:10.975 --> 05:12:16.997]  Here's a story by Betty Martini linked to a bunch of major studies.
[05:12:16.997 --> 05:12:18.978]  I mean, there's just so many of these.
[05:12:18.978 --> 05:12:27.541]  NoFluoride.com's got respective medical professionals and scientists are warning of long-term health consequences of fluoride.
[05:12:27.541 --> 05:12:31.562]  The Fluoride Risk Evidence of Link to Cancer, Newsweek.
[05:12:31.562 --> 05:12:32.583]  There's Newsweek right there!
[05:12:37.108 --> 05:12:48.537]  Yeah, because you had over 90% of the EPA scientists in 2001-2004 write letters to the EPA and FDA saying, why are you putting this in the water?
[05:12:48.537 --> 05:12:50.938]  It's deadly.
[05:12:50.938 --> 05:12:53.560]  A historical timeline of population control.
[05:12:53.560 --> 05:12:58.104]  We've got a great Jones Report article from Wake Up America that goes through it all.
[05:12:59.155 --> 05:13:00.757]  Fluoride Fact Sheet.
[05:13:00.757 --> 05:13:02.879]  David S. Kennedy, DDS.
[05:13:02.879 --> 05:13:04.041]  Very important to read.
[05:13:04.041 --> 05:13:07.345]  Fluoride, the hidden poison in the Natural Organic Standards.
[05:13:07.345 --> 05:13:10.368]  Ellen and Paul Conant, PhD.
[05:13:10.368 --> 05:13:13.912]  Comes on Hamilton.
[05:13:13.912 --> 05:13:16.255]  Result confirms doubts about fluoridation.
[05:13:17.483 --> 05:13:22.144]  EPA scientists and workers call for an end to water fluoridation because of cancer risk.
[05:13:22.144 --> 05:13:24.925]  ENS-Newswire.com.
[05:13:24.925 --> 05:13:26.465]  This is what you need to read right here, boy.
[05:13:26.465 --> 05:13:27.305]  That is powerful.
[05:13:27.305 --> 05:13:28.486]  In fact, I want to get them back on.
[05:13:28.486 --> 05:13:29.846]  It's been like five years.
[05:13:29.846 --> 05:13:30.766]  I want them back on.
[05:13:30.766 --> 05:13:33.167]  Top scientist testified before Congress.
[05:13:33.167 --> 05:13:36.648]  Dog food contaminated with levels of fluoride above EPA's limit.
[05:13:36.648 --> 05:13:38.488]  If we're humans.
[05:13:38.488 --> 05:13:41.549]  Finally, US EPA and Europe recognize toxicity of fluoride.
[05:13:44.428 --> 05:13:45.930]  It just goes on and on.
[05:13:45.930 --> 05:13:51.877]  But none of that matters because they're telling kids you're a subhuman squid if you don't drink your fluoride.
[05:13:51.877 --> 05:13:53.680]  Alright, I'm going to go ahead and go back to rebroadcast.
[05:13:53.680 --> 05:14:00.388]  Gerald Salente is coming up in about 45 minutes for almost two hours and also had the great filmmaker in studio with us.
[05:14:00.388 --> 05:14:03.171]  That's what we're about to rejoin right now.
[05:14:04.639 --> 05:14:09.702]  Very important information that we covered from the fall of America and Western world.
[05:14:09.702 --> 05:14:14.445]  So we'll join that interview in retransmission right now and I'll be back live tomorrow 11 a.m.
[05:14:14.445 --> 05:14:15.486]  to 3 p.m.
[05:14:15.486 --> 05:14:16.867]  Central Standard Time.
[05:14:16.867 --> 05:14:27.254]  We're gonna take the last 30 minutes I did on floor item and have Rob do try to boil it down to one 10-minute piece or maybe we'll do a 20-minute piece and give it to change the channel since he's got a director's account.
[05:14:27.554 --> 05:14:33.578]  We're going to get this out to everybody, and so they can understand brainwashing, propaganda, and how you're being poisoned.
[05:14:33.578 --> 05:14:34.879]  I'm Alex Jones signing off.
[05:14:34.879 --> 05:14:38.541]  Great job to the crew with this 5-hour, 14-minute transmission.
[05:14:38.541 --> 05:14:40.783]  We'll do it again, coming up in about, well, 18 hours, 45 minutes.
[05:14:42.964 --> 05:14:44.165]  I'm Alex Jones.
[05:14:44.165 --> 05:14:44.965]  I'm free.
[05:14:44.965 --> 05:14:46.286]  I'm a wild man.
[05:14:46.286 --> 05:14:47.926]  You're supposed to be a free human.
[05:14:47.926 --> 05:14:49.087]  You're not supposed to be a slave.
[05:14:49.087 --> 05:14:50.607]  You're not supposed to be a jellyfish.
[05:14:50.607 --> 05:14:51.768]  Get fired up.
[05:14:51.768 --> 05:14:53.709]  Get your soul burning for liberty.
[05:14:53.709 --> 05:14:57.250]  Let's go out there and kick the New World Order off the planet.
[05:14:57.250 --> 05:14:58.251]  God bless you all.
[05:15:20.467 --> 05:15:21.050]  Yeah.
