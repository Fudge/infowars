[00:00:05.498 --> 00:00:09.680]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.140]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.821]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.461 --> 00:00:17.102]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.643 --> 00:00:21.764]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.185 --> 00:00:30.267]  We have another powerful, very important transmission lined up for you today.
[00:00:30.347 --> 00:00:31.168]  We are live.
[00:00:31.248 --> 00:00:33.588]  It is the 17th day of September 2010.
[00:00:35.862 --> 00:00:38.924]  We have our once-a-week visit with Bob Chapman on the economy.
[00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:43.328]  And boy, it's going to be a very important time to have him on now with all that's happening.
[00:00:43.348 --> 00:00:46.070]  They're admitting that layoffs are at record levels.
[00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.154]  The double dip in the housing market has basically begun.
[00:00:51.214 --> 00:00:52.655]  Of course, it never really ended.
[00:00:53.756 --> 00:00:59.281]  Gold has reached an all-new height after breaking two previous records this week.
[00:01:00.592 --> 00:01:04.375]  It's at an all-time high, yet again breaking the last two previous records.
[00:01:05.115 --> 00:01:17.684]  The eugenicists are openly pushing the flu vaccine for pregnant women and saying basically that all the school children need it, even though it's admitted in hundreds of publications like the British Medical Journal.
[00:01:19.143 --> 00:01:41.855]  And the London Telegraph, the Associated Press, but again, that's hidden in the background, never on the nightly news, that massive neurological disorders, brain damage, Guillain-Barre, permanent epilepsy, narcolepsy, where you just pass out routinely when you're driving your car, walking down the street, or watching TV.
[00:01:42.316 --> 00:01:45.898]  I mean, this stuff is frying your brain by design.
[00:01:46.858 --> 00:01:51.700]  In fact, guys, I know it's in the stacks from a few weeks ago, but will you go back through the stack from about two weeks ago?
[00:01:52.141 --> 00:02:00.185]  I want all those Rockefeller Foundation documents where they admittedly created the vaccines that covertly sterilize you and brain damage you.
[00:02:01.185 --> 00:02:06.148]  We've had more than 10 reports written at InfoWars.com.
[00:02:07.128 --> 00:02:09.929]  By one of our great writers on that just the last few weeks.
[00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:15.871]  But when Sherry Tenpenny, Dr. Sherry Tenpenny joins us, I want to bring up some of those issues for her.
[00:02:16.831 --> 00:02:21.632]  Because for every thousand documents we find, there's tens of thousands we haven't run into.
[00:02:21.652 --> 00:02:24.773]  And it's just anytime we research, it's all public.
[00:02:24.813 --> 00:02:25.773]  They're proud of it.
[00:02:26.233 --> 00:02:28.154]  They're proud of how they're sterilizing you.
[00:02:28.174 --> 00:02:30.055]  They're proud of how they're brain damaging you.
[00:02:30.455 --> 00:02:32.295]  This is not even hidden.
[00:02:32.315 --> 00:02:35.036]  Do you understand the magnitude of that?
[00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:37.273]  The debate's over.
[00:02:37.774 --> 00:02:40.740]  If we bring this information out against them, it's over for them.
[00:02:42.073 --> 00:02:48.298]  When we bring the information out about global warming being man-made, or even being real, being a fraud, the debate is over.
[00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:55.284]  That's why Al Gore gets up there and tells the opposite of the truth and says, the debate is over on climate change.
[00:02:55.324 --> 00:02:56.845]  It's all man-made, it's deadly.
[00:02:57.525 --> 00:03:00.808]  In five years, San Francisco will be underwater, L.A.
[00:03:00.848 --> 00:03:04.411]  will be underwater, San Diego underwater, Malibu underwater.
[00:03:04.431 --> 00:03:06.813]  That's why he's buying, you know, giant houses right on the water.
[00:03:08.274 --> 00:03:11.576]  Because he knows the evidence all shows he's a stinking fraud.
[00:03:12.017 --> 00:03:17.380]  So he arrogantly claims whatever he wants to, hoping you just shut up and go away.
[00:03:18.081 --> 00:03:20.602]  If we move against these people, it's over for them.
[00:03:21.303 --> 00:03:22.123]  That's the truth.
[00:03:23.304 --> 00:03:24.225]  So we're going to talk about
[00:03:25.655 --> 00:03:32.022]  All over the country, school began, of course, a month ago, and they're forcing children to take a cocktail of deadly shots.
[00:03:32.762 --> 00:03:33.783]  That's even better, of course.
[00:03:33.803 --> 00:03:42.653]  They then can expand the special ed area with the brain-damaged children and get double or triple or quadruple the funding, federal funding and state funding they would get per pupil.
[00:03:43.093 --> 00:03:46.537]  That's a giant cash cow, the brain-damaging that's
[00:03:47.137 --> 00:03:57.669]  The schools are designed to brainwash your children, to dumb them down, to teach them how to have sex, to teach them how to tattle on you, to teach them how to be environmental cult members, and to teach them how to become brain damaged.
[00:03:57.749 --> 00:04:02.053]  That's just a beautiful system, when you realize how hardcore and satanic it is.
[00:04:02.754 --> 00:04:05.616]  And of course, the average teacher has no idea this is going on.
[00:04:05.636 --> 00:04:16.102]  They're just compartmentalizing brain damage like everybody else, sucking down fluoride, popping Prozac pills, drinking large amounts of alcohol, watching television all day, being brainwashed further.
[00:04:16.362 --> 00:04:17.222]  Well, I'm done.
[00:04:17.342 --> 00:04:18.363]  I'm a wild human.
[00:04:18.763 --> 00:04:21.885]  I'm a caveman with a high IQ, and I'm not their slave.
[00:04:21.945 --> 00:04:22.905]  I'm not their property.
[00:04:22.985 --> 00:04:24.066]  I see what they're doing.
[00:04:24.346 --> 00:04:26.607]  I see how brazen and out of control it is.
[00:04:26.948 --> 00:04:27.408]  And remember,
[00:04:27.708 --> 00:04:29.629]  I'm not up here saying all this to shock you.
[00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:31.190]  It's worse than I can say.
[00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.111]  It's worse than I can describe.
[00:04:33.371 --> 00:04:35.832]  It's more brazen than I can even imagine.
[00:04:36.132 --> 00:04:39.734]  The more I research, it always just gets worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.
[00:04:40.054 --> 00:04:42.915]  If I'd have heard Alex Jones 10 years ago, I'd have thought he was a nut.
[00:04:43.455 --> 00:04:45.236]  If Alex Jones would have heard Alex Jones.
[00:04:45.476 --> 00:04:48.498]  Because I didn't know what I knew now, 10 years ago.
[00:04:49.298 --> 00:04:49.619]  Okay?
[00:04:49.679 --> 00:04:54.046]  And that's what scares me, is it's always a thousand times worse than I could even imagine.
[00:04:54.446 --> 00:04:57.311]  But what we know is unspeakably off the chart.
[00:04:57.511 --> 00:04:58.392]  It's all coming up!
[00:04:58.412 --> 00:04:59.033]  Stay with us!
[00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.593]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:04.913 --> 00:05:05.194]  Number 1.
[00:05:05.834 --> 00:05:08.996]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:09.257 --> 00:05:09.817]  Number 2.
[00:05:10.117 --> 00:05:14.661]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:15.001 --> 00:05:15.441]  It's true.
[00:05:15.761 --> 00:05:20.325]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:20.625 --> 00:05:21.165]  Number 3.
[00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:24.728]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:25.028 --> 00:05:28.731]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:28.931 --> 00:05:29.472]  Number 4.
[00:05:29.732 --> 00:05:32.094]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:32.494 --> 00:05:35.878]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:36.178 --> 00:05:36.718]  Number 5.
[00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:40.882]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:41.122 --> 00:05:45.867]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:05:46.147 --> 00:05:50.172]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:06:53.614 --> 00:06:54.054]  Thank you!
[00:06:59.844 --> 00:07:02.587]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[00:07:02.968 --> 00:07:06.492]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[00:07:06.772 --> 00:07:09.415]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[00:07:09.655 --> 00:07:14.581]  You need to get your own supply of high-quality, storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[00:07:15.021 --> 00:07:20.662]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.
[00:07:20.962 --> 00:07:22.983]  It's all fresh, made on a monthly basis.
[00:07:23.303 --> 00:07:26.303]  Not some old cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[00:07:26.623 --> 00:07:30.904]  Try their new Evacuation Pack, a two-week supply of delicious, easy-to-fix food.
[00:07:31.164 --> 00:07:39.286]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it, with open talk of a strike on Iran in the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.
[00:07:39.646 --> 00:07:41.446]  Get yourself and your family ready today.
[00:07:41.906 --> 00:07:43.906]  The place to go is eFoodsDirect.com.

[00:07:52.068 --> 00:07:59.430]  Again, on the web, eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex, or give them a call at 800-409-5633.
[00:08:02.291 --> 00:08:07.852]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:08.312 --> 00:08:10.853]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:14.748 --> 00:08:15.989]  It is Friday.
[00:08:16.009 --> 00:08:19.231]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny joins us.
[00:08:19.251 --> 00:08:28.657]  We're going into another round of forced chemical biological lobotomies through the H1N1 combined with a seasonal flu shot.
[00:08:29.158 --> 00:08:37.003]  I thought we'd go over all the British Medical Journal, the EU Medical Commission, literally hundreds of confirmed mainstream reports.
[00:08:37.383 --> 00:08:40.285]  We told you a year and a half ago what was going to happen with the flu.
[00:08:40.725 --> 00:08:41.286]  It happened.
[00:08:41.546 --> 00:08:44.068]  The brain damage, the death, the injuries.
[00:08:44.808 --> 00:08:45.689]  That's hardcore evil.
[00:09:05.478 --> 00:09:08.539]  51 minutes from now, and then Bob Chapman on the economy.
[00:09:08.979 --> 00:09:16.162]  Speaking of the economy, let me just quickly go over this stack, then we'll mine into the data in the third hour.
[00:09:16.442 --> 00:09:20.503]  Gold and silver hit new highs for second time in one week.
[00:09:21.624 --> 00:09:24.225]  It's actually three times, but a good article by Steve Watson up at
[00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:26.450]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:09:26.991 --> 00:09:27.611]  Here's Bloomberg.
[00:09:27.651 --> 00:09:31.292]  Gold rises to record on increased demand for wealth protection.
[00:09:31.352 --> 00:09:35.913]  Yeah, that Fiat paper is getting worse and worse every day.
[00:09:36.434 --> 00:09:36.714]  U.S.
[00:09:36.774 --> 00:09:39.234]  worker poverty reaches 50-year high.
[00:09:39.555 --> 00:09:43.576]  That's even with federal bookkeepers cooking the numbers.
[00:09:44.116 --> 00:09:44.656]  Here's another one.
[00:09:44.736 --> 00:09:45.476]  MSNBC.
[00:09:45.536 --> 00:09:47.197]  Record number of Americans living in poverty.
[00:09:47.517 --> 00:09:48.878]  Census Bureau says 43.6 million people in 2009.
[00:09:48.918 --> 00:09:49.698]  Up near 4 million in a year.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.801]  So there you have it.
[00:09:56.021 --> 00:09:58.543]  Up an additional four mil in a year.
[00:10:00.684 --> 00:10:01.245]  Here's another one.
[00:10:01.285 --> 00:10:03.286]  Lost decade for family income.
[00:10:03.306 --> 00:10:04.227]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:10:04.267 --> 00:10:07.870]  People are getting poor at record numbers, as those last two reports showed.
[00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:09.431]  And this is globalism.
[00:10:09.471 --> 00:10:10.432]  This is NAFTA and GATT.
[00:10:10.452 --> 00:10:11.953]  This is the service economy.
[00:10:11.993 --> 00:10:17.117]  And don't worry, they've got even more deindustrialization planned for you.
[00:10:18.939 --> 00:10:22.641]  So that's just some of what's coming up on the economic front.
[00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:40.015]  And if you think the deindustrialization is an accident, it's stated by the UN, stated by the Club of Rome, stated by the State Department and State Department of Morandum 200 and many others, that the goal of globalism is to bankrupt you.
[00:10:40.615 --> 00:10:41.976]  It is to make you so poor
[00:10:42.896 --> 00:10:54.088]  And to shut down farms and ranches so you can't be self-sufficient, this is all stated, so that you go under government control, so they'll say we're gonna give you a food allowance with a card, but we need to sterilize your butt.
[00:10:54.986 --> 00:10:56.767]  And that's the plan, period.
[00:10:57.568 --> 00:10:59.128]  And it's finally all over the news.
[00:10:59.569 --> 00:11:04.411]  Everywhere I look, what they're saying isn't reasonable what the White House Czar says.
[00:11:04.471 --> 00:11:08.554]  He admits carbon taxes are, quote, to deindustrialize the United States.
[00:11:09.074 --> 00:11:12.776]  He's been sitting down with at least four different media outlets in the last week admitting it.
[00:11:13.076 --> 00:11:16.618]  He sat down with Cyber News Service, and we have his quotes.
[00:11:16.678 --> 00:11:16.979]  We'll be
[00:11:17.918 --> 00:11:21.243]  Going over some of those today.
[00:11:21.964 --> 00:11:23.586]  And he said point-blank.
[00:11:23.967 --> 00:11:26.991]  He said, yes, we want a post-industrial United States.
[00:11:27.552 --> 00:11:29.575]  We want to get rid of the economy.
[00:11:32.031 --> 00:11:34.053]  And he said, we're going to use the free market to do it.
[00:11:34.073 --> 00:11:35.414]  Of course, that's a lie.
[00:11:35.674 --> 00:11:46.342]  They're going to use tax incentives where they're going to raise taxes on industries and businesses they don't like, but then give you tax incentives to basically go with this de-industrialization program.
[00:11:46.902 --> 00:11:55.028]  And remember yesterday, we put out the key search term, eco-fascism.
[00:11:55.589 --> 00:11:58.431]  And then I noticed today, an article out of the Guardian,
[00:12:00.751 --> 00:12:04.673]  And it says, on alternative to the new wave of eco-fascism.
[00:12:05.314 --> 00:12:09.036]  And this article goes on to basically say, oh, they mean well with tyranny.
[00:12:09.316 --> 00:12:11.397]  It's a loving, green tyranny.
[00:12:13.418 --> 00:12:17.601]  But, we have a better way of doing it.
[00:12:17.741 --> 00:12:19.982]  So I'm going to be going over that report.
[00:12:20.002 --> 00:12:29.788]  It says, by liberating humanity from the compulsion to consume, climate catastrophe can be averted without recourse to authoritarianism.
[00:12:31.527 --> 00:12:33.628]  But they go ahead with a lie that climate's changing.
[00:12:34.188 --> 00:12:35.529]  And see, now it's not just global warming.
[00:12:35.549 --> 00:12:45.173]  They say any change, a thunderstorm, a dust storm, a tornado, man did it, you've got to pay an indulgence to the private corporations, to the central banks.
[00:12:45.693 --> 00:12:47.114]  So we're going to be going over that report.
[00:12:47.714 --> 00:12:53.257]  And we've also got this other London Guardian report, the powerful coalition that wants to engineer the world's climate.
[00:12:53.797 --> 00:13:03.671]  And they say, oh, they want to spray barium salts and aluminum dioxide on the population, spray it into the atmosphere to reflect the sun's rays to save us.
[00:13:04.392 --> 00:13:07.116]  And Bill Gates will get billions a year to run these companies.
[00:13:08.243 --> 00:13:19.551]  And you notice barium salts, aluminum dioxide, is what the chemtrail experts, scientists, environmentalists, others that really studied it, going back 15 years ago, they were proven completely correct.
[00:13:20.092 --> 00:13:28.317]  They said secret groups with secret government programs are spraying aluminum dioxide and barium salts in the atmosphere to reflect the sun's rays out.
[00:13:28.758 --> 00:13:30.959]  But it also poisons the soil,
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.723]  Hurts trees and other crops.
[00:13:35.665 --> 00:13:37.408]  Just plant life across the board.
[00:13:37.989 --> 00:13:41.513]  And then magically, 15 years later, it's all over the news.
[00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:44.718]  Yes, we've been testing spraying barium salts, lunar dioxide.
[00:13:45.058 --> 00:13:46.080]  It's all for your own good.
[00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:58.978]  And just suddenly the last two years, we literally have stacked, we have just a whole desk of stacks of patents and government reports and universities and Department of Energy and every other major government.
[00:13:59.198 --> 00:14:01.680]  They're just spraying 24-7 everywhere.
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.541]  I mean, it's just wild.
[00:14:03.921 --> 00:14:07.744]  Hundreds of different programs that were secret that are now partially declassified.
[00:14:08.024 --> 00:14:17.331]  They're just wall-to-wall manipulating the weather and probably creating a lot of the extreme weather we've seen as a pretext to sell all of this carbon taxing.
[00:14:19.969 --> 00:14:29.071]  And continuing with the Holdren situation, Paul Watson has a detailed report.
[00:14:30.377 --> 00:14:53.355]  that is up on PrisonPlanet.com that takes the background info and then integrates it in with all these other mainstream reports about how great it is they're spraying aluminum on you, how great it is they're spraying barium salts on you, how great it is that, oh, there's patents to add to the jet fuel so the airlines can help without even having to, you know, pay any extra money.
[00:14:53.395 --> 00:14:56.837]  The government's got secret programs to pay the jet fuel
[00:14:58.398 --> 00:14:59.719]  Makers to add it.
[00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:00.980]  Oh, it's so sweet.
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.081]  It's so loving.
[00:15:02.141 --> 00:15:03.202]  It's so good.
[00:15:03.262 --> 00:15:24.339]  It's been so secret now admitted But continuing geoengineering killing off the useless eaters and it dovetails with this CNS report Holdren uses free market to get back to the Stone Age and he says that's what we want We're going to destroy our industrial society
[00:15:26.636 --> 00:15:28.578]  But that's not actually the full story.
[00:15:29.339 --> 00:15:45.914]  They admit, and this is what I've been telling you for more than 12 years since I discovered this information, others knew it before I did, it's all out there and publicly available, the globalists going back 60 years said, we will freeze in the western world, in the developing world, in the third world, we will freeze industrial development.
[00:15:46.735 --> 00:15:57.559]  The central banks will get everybody in debt, they will take over the free market, then they will not allow loans to anyone who tries to further industrialize or develop sciences.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:11.065]  Then all of those technologies, robotics, manufacturing, nanotech, healthcare, that will be delivered by this new corporate global government to universities and private corporations in armored reservations.
[00:16:12.335 --> 00:16:13.276]  Like the J.J.
[00:16:13.397 --> 00:16:19.505]  Pickles Center in North Austin, where they've got a nuclear reactor and all sorts of secret stuff, and the general public doesn't even know it.
[00:16:19.886 --> 00:16:27.716]  They've got these reservations everywhere, but that's a low-tech reservation compared to Los Alamos and other labs they've got, and things like CERN.
[00:16:29.099 --> 00:16:34.020]  And so they will accelerate hyper technology for the global corporations.
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.781]  They will freeze the development for the general public.
[00:16:37.581 --> 00:16:41.862]  They'll allow a few new little developments and roll them out slowly for profit making.
[00:16:42.382 --> 00:16:44.643]  But under national security, they'll freeze everything else.
[00:16:44.683 --> 00:16:48.164]  They'll take control of web development through cyber security and freeze that.
[00:16:50.521 --> 00:16:59.625]  Any country that's not part of the New World Order system, there's only a handful of them now, will be attacked, will be economically attacked, physically attacked, militarily attacked.
[00:16:59.885 --> 00:17:04.786]  They won't be able to develop even 50, 60-year-old nuclear reactor technology for energy.
[00:17:05.107 --> 00:17:06.007]  They'll be frozen.
[00:17:06.047 --> 00:17:07.067]  They'll be bombarded.
[00:17:07.628 --> 00:17:10.068]  They'll have internal revolutions funded by the globalists.
[00:17:10.088 --> 00:17:10.889]  This is all stated.
[00:17:11.509 --> 00:17:12.009]  All stated.
[00:17:15.199 --> 00:17:23.164]  They will develop, and have developed now, this goes back over 60 years, hyper-advanced technologies that are kept secret from the public.
[00:17:23.605 --> 00:17:31.330]  Now I told you more than a decade ago, I was reading MIT reports and documents that were public, where they admitted they already had basically crystal balls.
[00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:33.171]  High-tech computer systems.
[00:17:33.211 --> 00:17:34.192]  They call them crystal balls.
[00:17:34.572 --> 00:17:35.392]  People laughed at me now.
[00:17:35.433 --> 00:17:36.473]  It's all over mainstream news.
[00:17:36.713 --> 00:17:37.834]  Google has crystal ball.
[00:17:38.354 --> 00:17:41.917]  They can predict mass movements over 99% of the time with pure accuracy.
[00:17:42.197 --> 00:17:44.438]  Individual movements 93% of the time.
[00:17:44.899 --> 00:17:46.200]  Just off cell phone tracking.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.902]  They've got algorithms, it's all jacked in.
[00:17:49.222 --> 00:17:50.644]  That's 30 years old.
[00:17:51.104 --> 00:17:53.306]  Believe me, right now, they can tell the future.
[00:17:53.927 --> 00:17:54.247]  Okay?
[00:17:54.587 --> 00:17:59.712]  Right now, they've got bioweapons and chemical weapons that will kill anybody comes in contact with them.
[00:17:59.892 --> 00:18:10.843]  They've got race-specific, individually down to your name and number, in these giant government factory systems, where in a matter of hours, they admit, with your blood sample, which they have everyone's blood sample of your 39 years,
[00:18:12.284 --> 00:18:13.885]  It's now been 39 years or younger.
[00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:14.586]  They have your blood.
[00:18:14.626 --> 00:18:16.688]  Worldwide program, now declassified.
[00:18:16.708 --> 00:18:18.049]  It's in a bioweapons lab.
[00:18:18.229 --> 00:18:30.661]  They've got these giant government-funded factories where they admit they can go in with these genetic engineer systems and create a, generally based on mousepox, bioweapon that will only kill you!
[00:18:32.247 --> 00:18:34.028]  That's a perfect assassination weapon.
[00:18:34.649 --> 00:18:39.513]  So, I mean, they've got it all, and that's why they're so arrogant, and they don't care if you know there's a world government.
[00:18:39.793 --> 00:18:42.095]  That's why they're coming out, yeah, we're Kim trailing you.
[00:18:42.275 --> 00:18:49.561]  That's why they're coming out going, yeah, tenfold increase in convulsions and brain damage, and it's the vaccines, and there's nothing you're gonna do about it.
[00:18:49.581 --> 00:18:50.982]  We're gonna inject you with it.
[00:18:54.144 --> 00:18:57.207]  I mean, this is the hardcore reality, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:58.268 --> 00:18:59.809]  This is why they're so arrogant.
[00:19:01.676 --> 00:19:14.910]  And already, we've got the confirmed reports, even from the Forestry Service, all over the United States, all over Canada, all over Europe, people are unable to grow many crops now because there's so much aluminum in the soil.
[00:19:16.412 --> 00:19:18.394]  And that's just one factor of this.
[00:19:19.215 --> 00:19:23.440]  But don't worry, Monsanto's coming out with entire seed lines of plants that grow in aluminum.
[00:19:26.104 --> 00:19:27.845]  You start to figure this out, don't you?
[00:19:28.285 --> 00:19:30.466]  And who is The Nation and Congress?
[00:19:30.526 --> 00:19:31.527]  It also has a report out.
[00:19:32.067 --> 00:19:32.887]  Who are they reporting?
[00:19:33.087 --> 00:19:36.429]  Of course, has XC Blackwater working for them?
[00:19:36.769 --> 00:19:37.470]  Monsanto.
[00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:38.770]  They got a plan.
[00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:39.891]  They've launched it.
[00:19:40.251 --> 00:19:41.712]  It's called scientific tyranny.
[00:19:42.665 --> 00:19:50.755]  And cops and FBI and all of you that love the system and are on petty power trips, bureaucrats, all of you, you better figure out you and your family are in the crosshairs.
[00:19:51.416 --> 00:19:52.357]  But you're not going to listen.
[00:19:52.377 --> 00:19:53.479]  You're going to get the flu shot.
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.523]  And a lot of you that get it, your child's going to have a convulsion.
[00:19:56.963 --> 00:19:58.185]  And then you'll be on the team.
[00:19:58.705 --> 00:20:00.427]  But you want to get hurt first, don't you?
[00:20:01.653 --> 00:20:06.114]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:21:01.695 --> 00:21:02.055]  Gold.
[00:21:02.295 --> 00:21:06.597]  If you listen to the radio, watch TV, or surf the net, you are hearing about gold.
[00:21:06.857 --> 00:21:09.418]  Eventually you will ask yourself, is gold right for me?
[00:21:09.678 --> 00:21:10.799]  The answer might surprise you.
[00:21:11.099 --> 00:21:13.480]  We protect ourselves and our families from many things.
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:14.860]  Do you have medical insurance?
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:15.941]  Is your home insured?
[00:21:15.961 --> 00:21:17.321]  Do you carry life insurance?
[00:21:17.561 --> 00:21:18.802]  How about financial insurance?
[00:21:19.122 --> 00:21:20.722]  If you own gold, then the answer is yes.
[00:21:21.083 --> 00:21:24.504]  If you don't own gold, the question is, why don't you have financial insurance?
[00:21:24.764 --> 00:21:26.445]  We put our faith in things we trust.
[00:21:26.805 --> 00:21:27.786]  Do you trust the dollar?
[00:21:27.986 --> 00:21:29.046]  Do you trust the economy?
[00:21:29.226 --> 00:21:30.187]  Do you trust the government?
[00:21:30.467 --> 00:21:32.368]  Gold has always been something you can trust.
[00:21:32.648 --> 00:21:35.309]  For thousands of years, people have put their faith in gold.
[00:21:35.629 --> 00:21:36.770]  Where will you put your faith?
[00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:39.571]  Now is the time to protect yourself and your family.

[00:22:03.304 --> 00:22:08.206]  The economy is crumbling, debt soaring, and the possibility of World War III is increasing.
[00:22:09.087 --> 00:22:20.173]  I started survivalistseeds.com from my dining room table with a small bucket of seed and a single rotating banner ad on prisonplanet.com.

[00:24:15.313 --> 00:24:17.075]  We need to wake up.
[00:24:17.855 --> 00:24:19.457]  I'm talking about myself included.
[00:24:20.258 --> 00:24:28.445]  We need to face just how real this scientific dictatorship, this global corporate crime syndicate is.
[00:24:29.907 --> 00:24:31.008]  If we don't man up,
[00:24:32.619 --> 00:24:33.260]  We're good to go.
[00:24:48.018 --> 00:24:50.841]  But we're designed to have some enjoyment.
[00:24:50.901 --> 00:24:52.782]  We're designed to enjoy some leisure.
[00:24:53.263 --> 00:24:55.325]  But we're way out of balance.
[00:24:55.745 --> 00:24:57.506]  We're obsessed with entertainment.
[00:24:57.967 --> 00:25:00.189]  We're obsessed with satiating ourselves.
[00:25:00.249 --> 00:25:06.715]  We're not focused, myself included, like we should be against a threat this real.
[00:25:06.895 --> 00:25:08.376]  We have true
[00:25:10.066 --> 00:25:18.508]  Bonafide, grade A, hardcore, supercharged despotism sitting on our backs.
[00:25:18.788 --> 00:25:20.688]  And we've got to get it off our backs.
[00:25:20.828 --> 00:25:38.512]  And it can be defeated because even if you've got evil people working for this corrupt system, you can explain to them that, hey, I know you're on a power trip being compartmentalized within the structure and having some power, but you are being targeted by this system as well.
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:44.482]  And this is leading us very quickly to a nightmare prison planet.
[00:25:45.802 --> 00:25:51.444]  Now, I want to shift gears into the attacks on free speech and the First Amendment.
[00:25:51.484 --> 00:26:01.388]  We talked about it yesterday, how in Ohio, multiple towns and cities are saying no Tea Party demonstrations allowed because the state is basically saying they're hate groups.
[00:26:01.988 --> 00:26:03.369]  Lawsuits have been filed.
[00:26:04.623 --> 00:26:14.458]  Supreme Court Justice Breyer is on ABC News saying we may ban burning Korans because that's not a free speech right, which is asinine.
[00:26:15.519 --> 00:26:19.786]  We have just got massive reports along these lines pouring out.
[00:26:21.596 --> 00:26:27.300]  But then, a few days ago, we saw some local news articles on this and wrote a story about it.
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.722]  Now, we discovered and confirmed what Wayne Madsen said.
[00:26:30.742 --> 00:26:34.705]  It turned out it was all over the newspapers in Pennsylvania, breaking yesterday.
[00:26:52.216 --> 00:27:01.180]  It turns out they're not a non-profit like the media said, and it was to spy on anti-gas drilling groups, environmental groups, tea parties.
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:08.483]  It first broke because this group put out reports demonizing tea parties and demonizing anyone that wants tax cuts.
[00:27:09.143 --> 00:27:11.484]  The quotes in the newspapers were that by
[00:27:11.824 --> 00:27:25.028]  Saying you don't want taxes, that threatens government infrastructure, because God forbid citizens get involved in government, as we're supposed to here on Constitution Day, 220 plus years after the signing of the Constitution, the ratification of the Constitution.
[00:27:25.429 --> 00:27:30.990]  Heaven forbid that citizens actually be involved in their government and get taxes cut.
[00:27:31.791 --> 00:27:35.232]  So it started there, but now it turns out they were at the G20 in Pittsburgh,
[00:27:37.211 --> 00:27:39.053]  And that they were spying on the activist groups.
[00:27:39.133 --> 00:27:46.559]  We saw private groups, this is admitted, driving around, grabbing citizens off the streets for no reason, throwing them into cars.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:47.861]  Rob Dew was arrested.
[00:27:48.121 --> 00:27:55.627]  He was at a military armory with police and military and saw people being brought off the backs of trucks and vans with bags on their heads.
[00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:59.411]  Luke Rodowski was arrested.
[00:27:59.471 --> 00:28:02.473]  So, my crew has been in the middle of this.
[00:28:03.653 --> 00:28:27.332]  And it turns out that when, and this is covered in Police State 4, the rise of FEMA, that Rob Dew and the guys, I sent them to the military base at the start of the G20, or the night before it started, because they had a press release out saying that the National Guard would be used against citizens, and it had the name of the public information officer, so they pull up politely and say, hi, we're here, you know, with Alex Jones, we're here to find out
[00:28:28.675 --> 00:28:29.396]  What's going on?
[00:28:29.476 --> 00:28:30.277]  What the military is going to do?
[00:28:30.297 --> 00:28:32.119]  We'd like to interview your public information officer.
[00:28:32.139 --> 00:28:33.160]  And they said, stay here.
[00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:35.822]  20 minutes later, they came back and they said, we're not going to talk to you.
[00:28:35.842 --> 00:28:36.383]  Get out of here.
[00:28:36.883 --> 00:28:37.784]  They got me on the phone.
[00:28:37.824 --> 00:28:38.665]  I talked to the guy.
[00:28:39.166 --> 00:28:40.427]  It's all on video in the film.
[00:28:41.408 --> 00:28:42.970]  And he just said, no, you're not real media.
[00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:43.450]  Get out of here.
[00:28:43.931 --> 00:28:45.733]  And so the guys peacefully drove away.
[00:28:46.153 --> 00:28:49.556]  And then the police came and called him and said, you're a terrorist.
[00:28:49.637 --> 00:28:51.579]  You're going to be in a terror database the rest of your life.
[00:28:52.632 --> 00:28:53.632]  And that's the end of it.
[00:28:53.672 --> 00:29:01.896]  You don't protest in America, you don't go to a military base and ask to speak to the public information officer who was saying, you know, media come talk to me if you have questions.
[00:29:03.456 --> 00:29:07.157]  And it turns out an Israeli company was intimately involved in all of this.
[00:29:07.678 --> 00:29:09.638]  And so, is this not high treason?
[00:29:11.639 --> 00:29:16.121]  I mean, I know Israel's supposed to be our little ally in all of this, but I have a question for everybody.
[00:29:17.373 --> 00:29:19.514]  Our government's been taken over by private corporations.
[00:29:19.594 --> 00:29:21.875]  Blackwater's being used domestically, now XC.
[00:29:22.516 --> 00:29:30.059]  If you had a Chinese company hired coast-to-coast to spy on citizens and to list Tea Party people as terrorists, would that be a big deal?
[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:34.401]  Is Glenn Beck going to talk about an Israeli company spying on the Tea Party?
[00:29:35.142 --> 00:29:35.922]  Don't hold your breath.
[00:29:36.322 --> 00:29:37.763]  But we are going to cover it.
[00:29:38.003 --> 00:29:39.384]  Pennsylvania Homeland Security
[00:29:40.603 --> 00:29:43.324]  Employed Israeli company to suppress American political speech.
[00:29:43.344 --> 00:29:45.605]  They're now being sued by multiple groups.
[00:29:46.025 --> 00:29:47.886]  That's all coming up on the other side.
[00:29:48.446 --> 00:29:50.266]  Israeli secret police in America.
[00:29:51.027 --> 00:29:51.907]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.407 --> 00:29:54.008]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.948 --> 00:29:57.609]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:30:57.486 --> 00:30:59.228]  This information is too important to wait.
[00:31:04.326 --> 00:31:05.227]  Tyranny is here.
[00:31:05.567 --> 00:31:09.490]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:11.752]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:31:11.912 --> 00:31:17.176]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:31:17.617 --> 00:31:23.842]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:31:24.262 --> 00:31:29.825]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:31:30.245 --> 00:31:33.907]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:31:34.427 --> 00:31:38.429]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:31:38.709 --> 00:31:44.232]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:31:44.652 --> 00:31:47.633]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:31:48.214 --> 00:31:49.634]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:31:50.195 --> 00:31:50.615]  It's here.

[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:03.941]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:32:04.181 --> 00:32:10.222]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:32:10.582 --> 00:32:17.683]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:32:17.963 --> 00:32:22.544]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:32:22.844 --> 00:32:24.965]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:32:27.785 --> 00:32:30.448]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:32:30.508 --> 00:32:32.350]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:32:46.405 --> 00:32:58.490]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:32:58.750 --> 00:32:59.170]  Thank you.
[00:33:00.231 --> 00:33:07.134]  What we've got here is failure to communicate.
[00:33:07.194 --> 00:33:10.075]  Some men you just can't reach.
[00:33:11.252 --> 00:33:16.455]  So you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it.
[00:33:16.495 --> 00:33:17.576]  Well, he is.
[00:33:17.676 --> 00:33:26.341]  I don't like it any more than you do.
[00:33:26.701 --> 00:33:28.963]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:29.343 --> 00:33:30.704]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:38.966]  I'm going to have Rob Dube pop in and tell you what he saw at the G20 just to remind folks.
[00:33:38.986 --> 00:33:45.392]  And it turns out this Israeli intelligence connected company was involved spying on the citizens.
[00:33:46.253 --> 00:33:48.074]  And not just with the G20.
[00:33:48.955 --> 00:33:53.780]  And being paid by the state to compile a list of people they said posed a terrorist threat.
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.082]  Now the governor is apologizing for this.
[00:33:56.422 --> 00:33:57.884]  They want to keep all this secret.
[00:33:58.632 --> 00:34:02.094]  But remember NLEO-9 and NLEO-10 this year with FEMA.
[00:34:02.554 --> 00:34:09.478]  In the FEMA press releases it said troops from 14 countries training to take on the American people.
[00:34:09.738 --> 00:34:19.523]  Then I sent Rob Dew and Jason Douglas a few months ago to Chicago and they had multiple drills of putting Americans in the sports stadium and putting up barbed wire.
[00:34:19.903 --> 00:34:25.226]  They had multiple drills with Polish and other troops practicing to take on the American people.
[00:34:26.923 --> 00:34:34.469]  They admit in the Washington Post that they've got a North American Union, SPP deal to use, quote, Mexican and Canadian troops in the U.S.
[00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:36.971]  At the G20 this year, they used U.S.
[00:34:37.011 --> 00:34:42.756]  forces in the cities where they had the G20 meeting.
[00:34:43.276 --> 00:34:45.018]  This is being done everywhere.
[00:34:45.738 --> 00:34:54.301]  And they had black and blue vans pulling up with people in shorts and t-shirts, grabbing citizens and throwing them in vans and putting bags over their heads.
[00:34:54.661 --> 00:34:56.841]  Same thing at the G20 a year and a half ago in England.
[00:34:57.362 --> 00:34:59.442]  The same thing is being done everywhere.
[00:34:59.822 --> 00:35:01.543]  And they do it in front of news cameras.
[00:35:02.867 --> 00:35:08.492]  And we put out National Guard snatches and grabs people with that video from the G-20.
[00:35:08.652 --> 00:35:14.317]  And we got contacted that day by G-20 private security at this office.
[00:35:14.917 --> 00:35:15.918]  I called the number back.
[00:35:15.978 --> 00:35:18.580]  It was the official G-20 command center number.
[00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:22.163]  And they said, we're not going to tell you our names, but you can see our number and caller ID.
[00:35:22.403 --> 00:35:26.066]  Those were private security forces who wear U.S.
[00:35:26.247 --> 00:35:28.709]  Army National Guard uniforms.
[00:35:29.355 --> 00:35:31.537]  So, I mean, that's classic Third World.
[00:35:31.577 --> 00:35:32.918]  You ever seen Romancing the Stone?
[00:35:33.379 --> 00:35:33.939]  Great movie.
[00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:37.142]  With Douglas in it.
[00:35:37.742 --> 00:35:43.667]  Where the bad guy is all over the Latin American countries and one time he's a general, next he's a colonel, then he's a police chief.
[00:35:43.988 --> 00:35:46.490]  He's always wearing, what's his name, Zorro or something in it?
[00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:49.552]  The point is, that's really what a secret police is like.
[00:35:50.353 --> 00:35:58.601]  They do whatever they want, you don't know who they are, they've got fake IDs, they're foreign, and they're just running around doing whatever they want.
[00:35:58.641 --> 00:36:00.603]  So this report is so big.
[00:36:01.003 --> 00:36:12.434]  Remember back in the 1990s, in fact I think it was 1994, well you guys search engine, Mossad caught in San Francisco breaking into police files and actually got convicted for it.
[00:36:13.977 --> 00:36:16.238]  Or it was Mossad acting as ADL.
[00:36:16.278 --> 00:36:18.839]  Headline, ADL caught breaking into police files.
[00:36:18.999 --> 00:36:24.140]  And it turned out they were paying off police and basically running the police department intelligence unit.
[00:36:24.961 --> 00:36:27.361]  And so this is real, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:27.621 --> 00:36:32.643]  And I talked about this yesterday and saw the YouTube video, people commenting, I can't believe Alex is criticizing Israel.
[00:36:32.663 --> 00:36:33.463]  I mean, he never does that.
[00:36:33.843 --> 00:36:37.404]  We've done hundreds of videos criticizing when Israel does things like this.
[00:36:37.444 --> 00:36:39.805]  People every time say, this is the first time I've ever seen it.
[00:36:40.065 --> 00:36:40.705]  I've never seen it.
[00:36:40.886 --> 00:36:42.206]  Look, we criticize anybody.
[00:36:42.978 --> 00:36:45.959]  Who is in here violating the Bill of Rights and Constitution?
[00:36:46.479 --> 00:36:48.840]  And imagine, again, if the Chinese were doing this.
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:57.324]  If our government had hired the Chinese to come in and spy on Americans and to be involved, the evidence is beginning to show, in the snatching and grabbing.
[00:36:58.109 --> 00:37:02.014]  And Luke talked about seeing the trucks and vans come in, people with bags on their heads.
[00:37:02.434 --> 00:37:05.378]  They would take people and strip them down and then make fun of them and laugh at them.
[00:37:06.279 --> 00:37:08.222]  Rob Dew saw this go on.
[00:37:08.282 --> 00:37:11.586]  Rob Dew just tried to go to the military and say, I'd like to talk to your spokesperson.
[00:37:11.966 --> 00:37:15.390]  And then they called the police and said they were trying to blow up the base.
[00:37:16.231 --> 00:37:22.535]  I mean, just out of hand, you're an American scumbag media, you come to the U.S.
[00:37:22.635 --> 00:37:43.346]  Army and politely say, it's all on video, in the film, we have the footage shot from the car, very politely saying, yes sir, we saw your press release, we said the media should make inquiries here at the base to talk to the military, and they just came out and called the police and said, hey, these are terrorists, they were sneaking around, maybe trying to attack the base.
[00:37:44.445 --> 00:37:45.546]  Pulled right up to the front.
[00:37:47.348 --> 00:37:49.231]  This is what America is now.
[00:37:49.311 --> 00:37:52.675]  This is bonafide, hardcore tyranny.
[00:37:53.436 --> 00:37:57.561]  This is everything we supposedly fought the Soviets over and fought the Nazis over.
[00:37:58.675 --> 00:38:00.116]  And Israel's a police state.
[00:38:00.757 --> 00:38:01.877]  England's a police state.
[00:38:02.238 --> 00:38:04.259]  The United States is a hardcore police state.
[00:38:04.439 --> 00:38:07.141]  They're setting up checkpoints all over the country now, searching people.
[00:38:07.361 --> 00:38:11.184]  And the police are in NBC News saying, quote, we can do whatever we want.
[00:38:11.744 --> 00:38:12.925]  You don't have any rights.
[00:38:12.965 --> 00:38:13.886]  And then here's this article.
[00:38:14.186 --> 00:38:16.267]  Government bans Tea Party from celebrating U.S.
[00:38:16.307 --> 00:38:16.908]  Constitution.
[00:38:17.248 --> 00:38:18.449]  Today is Constitution Day.
[00:38:18.689 --> 00:38:21.711]  They tried to get a permit for two months in multiple towns.
[00:38:22.071 --> 00:38:25.434]  They already, at the beginning of the year, were denied the right to demonstrate.
[00:38:27.145 --> 00:38:31.048]  First they trick you and say you've got to get a permit, then they deny the permit.
[00:38:31.308 --> 00:38:36.211]  You don't need a permit to demonstrate, only if you're going to block roads for a parade, for a commercial parade.
[00:38:36.791 --> 00:38:38.353]  They're training you, you can't demonstrate.
[00:38:38.373 --> 00:38:39.914]  They're training you, you don't have rights.
[00:38:41.054 --> 00:38:48.279]  I noticed in Chicago, tens of thousands of police demonstrated yesterday, and I read the articles closely, they didn't get a permit!
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:52.002]  But the police didn't go after them, and I say that's good!
[00:38:52.022 --> 00:38:56.745]  Because you don't need a stinking permit to go protest outside City Hall or the police station.
[00:38:58.757 --> 00:39:03.040]  I couldn't believe a few months ago in Austin a local group went and got a permit to protest.
[00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:06.003]  You just give in to this evil when you do that.
[00:39:06.343 --> 00:39:06.943]  A permit?
[00:39:07.744 --> 00:39:09.245]  That's like a permit to own a gun.
[00:39:10.006 --> 00:39:10.867]  It's outrageous.
[00:39:11.267 --> 00:39:13.509]  I'm not criticizing people, I'm just sick of it.
[00:39:14.109 --> 00:39:14.649]  But look at this.
[00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:19.693]  Pennsylvania Homeland Security puts anti-tax protesters on list of terror threats.
[00:39:20.154 --> 00:39:21.295]  Pittsburgh Tribune Review.
[00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:23.741]  Lawsuits are now filed.
[00:39:23.981 --> 00:39:24.901]  But it was every group.
[00:39:25.482 --> 00:39:26.302]  It was peaceful groups.
[00:39:26.682 --> 00:39:34.647]  Remember Fahrenheit 9-11 showed groups in Houston and in Northern California who would bake cookies and sit around and talk about peace.
[00:39:35.027 --> 00:39:37.468]  And they had police informants inside their groups.
[00:39:37.928 --> 00:39:40.370]  Remember what came out back in November of 2008?
[00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:42.211]  It's in the Obama deception.
[00:39:43.578 --> 00:39:58.182]  That Ron Paul was being watched in Houston and his in the FedRally, and then in Dallas, we were being watched, and it said in the Army report that was leaked to us by Patriots, at Camp Mabry by the way, it said in the report, don't let them know you're Army, they may kill you!
[00:39:58.202 --> 00:40:07.385]  You got a multi-racial crowd out there saying we don't want banker bailouts, we want the Federal Reserve audited, and because of that,
[00:40:08.459 --> 00:40:14.745]  And notice the year after that, the House passed the law, the Senate blocked it to audit the Fed.
[00:40:15.225 --> 00:40:16.567]  And the Army was there!
[00:40:17.087 --> 00:40:17.788]  The Army!
[00:40:18.048 --> 00:40:21.592]  Well, if you don't like the Army spying on you, how about Israeli operatives?
[00:40:21.992 --> 00:40:26.356]  How about Israeli operatives paid taxpayer money to spy on everybody?
[00:40:26.376 --> 00:40:30.480]  Did you guys find the ADL caught breaking into police intelligence files?
[00:40:32.102 --> 00:40:32.722]  It's everywhere.
[00:40:32.782 --> 00:40:33.223]  It's from the...
[00:40:35.261 --> 00:40:35.781]  Call Watson.
[00:40:35.801 --> 00:40:37.882]  He's the ultimate master of searches, even better than me.
[00:40:38.062 --> 00:40:38.702]  He'll be able to find it.
[00:40:39.823 --> 00:40:42.704]  I don't want to make a claim here and then not put it up on screen.
[00:40:42.744 --> 00:40:44.384]  We must put it up on screen.
[00:40:44.825 --> 00:40:46.565]  Let me think of the exact search headline.
[00:40:46.585 --> 00:40:52.367]  Well, I mean, that's it.
[00:40:52.427 --> 00:40:56.269]  ADL caught stealing police intelligence files.
[00:40:56.289 --> 00:40:56.849]  I mean, that's it.
[00:40:58.584 --> 00:41:00.665]  ADL caught stealing police intelligence.
[00:41:01.545 --> 00:41:02.246]  No, I know you are.
[00:41:02.566 --> 00:41:06.007]  I'm just trying to get the answer to the thing so we can get that out there for people.
[00:41:06.548 --> 00:41:08.629]  Okay, let's go to Rob Dew about this.
[00:41:08.989 --> 00:41:18.894]  Rob, I mean, what do you think of the fact that you now learn that not only was the army out there spying on people, but that the Israeli Mossad-connected private intelligence group?
[00:41:19.574 --> 00:41:22.275]  After going to the G20, nothing surprises me anymore.
[00:41:22.535 --> 00:41:25.276]  I mean, these people are out of control.
[00:41:25.337 --> 00:41:25.817]  They treated
[00:41:26.934 --> 00:41:32.717]  Everybody that I saw there, you know, these were peaceful protesting citizens and they were treated like common criminals.
[00:41:32.737 --> 00:41:39.261]  You know, we were locked up and I had actually, they told us to leave and I started to walk up a hill where they were coming down the hill.
[00:41:39.301 --> 00:41:42.523]  They had scheduled this to be an entrapment exercise.
[00:41:42.883 --> 00:41:43.624]  They call it kettling.
[00:41:44.224 --> 00:41:45.726]  And so they rounded up a bunch of people.
[00:41:45.786 --> 00:41:49.110]  Most of them were college kids that weren't even protesting.
[00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:53.475]  They just happened to be on the campus, you know, walking around in their boxer shorts and t-shirts.
[00:41:53.775 --> 00:41:56.458]  And anyway, halfway through the night, they start
[00:41:57.694 --> 00:41:58.914]  They started bringing in people.
[00:41:59.574 --> 00:42:06.756]  The one guy that I particularly saw, he was breathing heavy, he had the bag over his head, and then they had him hogtied with the handcuffs by him.
[00:42:06.776 --> 00:42:09.796]  They had four guys, one on each limb, carrying him in.
[00:42:09.877 --> 00:42:14.017]  And he seemed like, you know, he was maybe not hyperventilating, but breathing really heavy.
[00:42:14.117 --> 00:42:15.398]  He seemed he was very distressed.
[00:42:15.958 --> 00:42:26.340]  And they brought him into a room, set him in a chair, I guess, I don't know what they did, but they had a video camera on him the whole time, and two guys sitting outside the room looking at him with the door open.
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:31.585]  And, um, this guy couldn't have been more than, you know, 95, 115 pounds.
[00:42:31.625 --> 00:42:32.706]  It wasn't that big at all.
[00:42:33.107 --> 00:42:37.031]  And, uh, you could tell the mindset with, with these, um,
[00:42:38.086 --> 00:42:42.649]  With these guys that were watching us, they thought they were doing, you know, God's work.
[00:42:43.009 --> 00:42:45.071]  And it was really distressing to see that.
[00:42:45.771 --> 00:42:50.355]  Especially because people were listening to the police.
[00:42:50.515 --> 00:42:52.736]  You know, when they said to move, they were trying to move.
[00:42:52.776 --> 00:42:56.359]  But then they had already blocked off the streets and kettled them in.
[00:42:56.519 --> 00:42:57.279]  So there was nowhere to go.
[00:42:57.439 --> 00:42:59.421]  Now they were trying to set a precedent.
[00:43:01.055 --> 00:43:05.318]  They were trying to set a precedent to scare everybody so less and less people come out and protest.
[00:43:05.358 --> 00:43:13.304]  The statistics show worldwide where these exact same tactics of the stormtrooper outfits, the hired provocateur so the police can attack the peaceful crowds.
[00:43:13.604 --> 00:43:14.745]  This is being done by design.
[00:43:14.985 --> 00:43:17.967]  Guys, you can zoom in with the document cam video here on the screen.
[00:43:18.807 --> 00:43:20.008]  Spy case updated.
[00:43:20.408 --> 00:43:21.549]  Former policeman Tom...
[00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:29.677]  Gerard returned to San Francisco from the Philippines May 7th and was immediately arrested on four counts of conspiracy, stealing government documents.
[00:43:29.937 --> 00:43:38.785]  The stolen records and police intelligence files were ordered destroyed in 1990 and contain information on thousands of individuals and hundreds of groups ranging across the political spectrum.
[00:43:39.226 --> 00:43:44.371]  Some 1,200 of the individuals listed on his files are Arab Americans who have never broken any laws.
[00:43:44.871 --> 00:43:46.613]  And it goes in to talk about
[00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:55.714]  The Anti-Defamation League basically hiring police officers and police departments all over California to give them these files.
[00:43:55.974 --> 00:43:57.575]  But now they don't even need to do that.
[00:43:58.155 --> 00:44:03.057]  Now they can just go and get paid by the government and be tied into Homeland Security.
[00:44:03.077 --> 00:44:05.638]  So you've got a foreign power who's been caught spying on the U.S.
[00:44:06.059 --> 00:44:09.160]  over and over again, now being paid to advise Homeland Security.
[00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:13.162]  Now being paid to be inside Homeland Security and to spy on the American people.
[00:44:13.342 --> 00:44:18.206]  Yeah, and if you go ask a question about it, they're going to send, you know, Sick the Sheriff on you, which is what they did to us.
[00:44:18.286 --> 00:44:22.910]  You know, we went up there, you can see it all on Police State 4, we laid it all out on the line.
[00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:38.603]  We drove up, it was me and Jason Burmas, asked to speak to the PAO, he finally comes out, you know, we ask him a couple questions, he doesn't want to answer anything on camera, doesn't want to talk to us, doesn't like our credentials, says it's the middle of the night when it was, you know, 7.50 PM, you know,
[00:44:41.545 --> 00:44:42.085]  In the evening.
[00:44:42.245 --> 00:44:43.086]  It wasn't that late.
[00:44:44.086 --> 00:44:44.526]  We leave.
[00:44:44.566 --> 00:44:46.127]  A car follows us as we're leaving.
[00:44:46.767 --> 00:44:48.788]  Gets off after an exit and does a turnaround.
[00:44:49.028 --> 00:44:52.530]  But they were waiting for us on the opposite side of the road, facing the opposite direction.
[00:44:52.570 --> 00:44:54.831]  They turn around and get behind us.
[00:44:55.491 --> 00:45:04.376]  And then we get back to the hotel and all of a sudden, Jason Douglas, who wasn't even there with us, he got a call because we got the rental car in his name.
[00:45:04.416 --> 00:45:06.897]  So they traced it down from the license plate.
[00:45:07.757 --> 00:45:12.060]  And got the rental car company, and then we're sticking the sheriff on him, telling him, well, you might be terrorists.
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:13.781]  We're worried about you guys.
[00:45:14.802 --> 00:45:19.064]  All we were doing was covering the event and following up on a lead that we got sent to us.
[00:45:19.645 --> 00:45:20.746]  And that's against the law, I guess.
[00:45:21.086 --> 00:45:22.146]  Guys, you can zoom in.
[00:45:22.186 --> 00:45:25.689]  Here's a Counterpunch article by Alexander Cockburn.
[00:45:26.409 --> 00:45:32.553]  Counterpunch, ADL snoops, and then it gets into all the spying, really all over the country with police departments.
[00:45:32.593 --> 00:45:35.155]  And it's the ADL that trains the police departments.
[00:45:35.575 --> 00:45:47.322]  So if they've been caught buying off cops, having cops give them the files, who then later go to work for them, why is the ADL then now, 15 years later, in even more control of our police?
[00:45:47.942 --> 00:45:48.662]  That's pretty scary.
[00:45:51.361 --> 00:45:59.913]  It makes you wonder who's running things, who is really running the power structure there because the police are supposed to be local and that's why they bring these chief of police from out of town.
[00:46:00.353 --> 00:46:01.835]  They don't have any ties to the community.
[00:46:02.075 --> 00:46:04.639]  Our sheriff, our police chief now, he's from LA.
[00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:08.452]  And probably the next guy will be from, you know, somewhere else.
[00:46:08.472 --> 00:46:09.492]  It'll probably be from Afghanistan.
[00:46:09.552 --> 00:46:14.696]  Oh, no, they admittedly have a special federal government commission that recommends the chiefs.
[00:46:14.836 --> 00:46:20.500]  And when Arte Saavedra was about to get the job a few months ago for Dallas Police Chief, it said the feds were recommending him.
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:21.400]  Oh, yeah.
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:22.341]  But he plays ball.
[00:46:22.361 --> 00:46:23.942]  But they were also recommending some other ones.
[00:46:24.382 --> 00:46:25.323]  So this is what they do.
[00:46:25.803 --> 00:46:34.449]  Yeah, I mean, you know, entrapping people with illegal gun buys, you know, having an illegal go in and pose and buy a gun, you know, that was all set up through the local police.
[00:46:35.276 --> 00:46:44.706]  And, you know, where in the Constitution does it say, you know, the local police should go out and set up sting operations for people selling firearms?
[00:46:45.266 --> 00:46:46.387]  You know, the guy had a license.
[00:46:46.668 --> 00:46:51.052]  How is he supposed to know it's not, you know, his license isn't real or that guy's an illegal?
[00:46:51.172 --> 00:46:51.833]  How is he supposed to know?
[00:46:51.853 --> 00:46:57.798]  The government gives the illegal aliens driver's license and they go buy a gun, lie about it, and it's fine.
[00:46:57.978 --> 00:46:58.199]  Yeah.
[00:46:58.299 --> 00:47:01.822]  Because, hey, you're helping put American veterans in prison and that's the enemy.
[00:47:02.283 --> 00:47:05.065]  Remember what these ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, reports.
[00:47:05.426 --> 00:47:07.127]  They're all aimed at the American people.
[00:47:07.167 --> 00:47:16.376]  They're all aimed at gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, and you've got all these Glenn Beck-type neocons that worship anything Israel does, and meanwhile they're the ones being spied on and put in the files.
[00:47:16.516 --> 00:47:17.837]  Yeah, and they don't realize it.
[00:47:17.857 --> 00:47:20.259]  They're just doing the work for them, I guess.
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:23.002]  Well, look at Israel itself.
[00:47:23.042 --> 00:47:26.165]  There's a lot of people that don't like some of the corrupt things Israel does in Israel.
[00:47:26.565 --> 00:47:34.092]  And if media people report they have something worse in Israel than what England has with the denotices, the government will say you're not allowed to report on that.
[00:47:34.753 --> 00:47:36.895]  They'll actually go arrest scientists or reporters.
[00:47:37.395 --> 00:47:38.977]  I mean, Israel is a police state.
[00:47:40.075 --> 00:47:41.856]  And this is what governments do.
[00:47:41.916 --> 00:47:49.221]  They try to come in and buy influence in governments and get power because Israel wants all of those tens of billions of dollars in aid the U.S.
[00:47:49.241 --> 00:47:49.541]  gives them.
[00:47:49.781 --> 00:47:51.202]  But I support Ron Paul.
[00:47:51.282 --> 00:47:52.683]  I say get rid of all the foreign aid.
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:54.420]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:56.541]  You know, and let's see what these countries do now.
[00:47:56.681 --> 00:47:59.462]  You know, take the money and, you know, spend it here.
[00:47:59.622 --> 00:48:01.062]  But that's just the aid we know about.
[00:48:01.082 --> 00:48:04.183]  Then you have all these hundreds of Israeli groups and others.
[00:48:04.283 --> 00:48:10.666]  There's a lot of British intel groups operating, but Israel's, the lion's share, operating domestically, spying on us.
[00:48:10.946 --> 00:48:11.126]  Right.
[00:48:11.206 --> 00:48:14.887]  I mean, I have the ADL Southern Poverty Law Center saying I'm the Grand Poobah, the great enemy.
[00:48:16.385 --> 00:48:16.925]  And you know why?
[00:48:16.965 --> 00:48:20.368]  Because they really hate me because I'm not a white supremacist.
[00:48:20.788 --> 00:48:22.309]  Because I protest the Klan.
[00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:25.132]  Because I'm against any group that's violating people's rights.
[00:48:25.512 --> 00:48:32.457]  And I put out the info in a way that is widely accepted and palatable and that isn't racial or religious or bigoted.
[00:48:32.737 --> 00:48:35.359]  That's why the government's been caught funding Hal Turner.
[00:48:37.941 --> 00:48:42.046]  I saw another article out of Florida, white supremacist rallies, they're all feds.
[00:48:42.507 --> 00:48:43.368]  We see them all the time.
[00:48:43.608 --> 00:48:45.690]  German white supremacists that come out are feds.
[00:48:46.131 --> 00:48:54.080]  Because they're there to say, we don't like the Federal Reserve, we don't like the war, and by the way, let's kill all the Jews, to make it sound horrible.
[00:48:54.301 --> 00:48:56.003]  Well that's why those groups are being funded.
[00:48:57.281 --> 00:49:03.606]  You see, because all we're fighting is organized crime, whether it's British organized crime, Israeli organized crime, Federal Reserve organized crime.
[00:49:03.927 --> 00:49:07.690]  Everybody's against organized crime, whether you're German, Chinese, Jewish, Mexican.
[00:49:08.711 --> 00:49:12.734]  See, I'm against the out-of-control Jewish mafia.
[00:49:12.834 --> 00:49:16.297]  I'm against the MS-13 Mechila Raza crowd.
[00:49:16.537 --> 00:49:17.859]  That's all that is, is a gang.
[00:49:19.181 --> 00:49:23.666]  And then they use political correctness to make people who aren't corrupt stand down and put up with the corruption.
[00:49:23.886 --> 00:49:26.149]  Oh, you don't like foreign Mossad spying on you?
[00:49:26.529 --> 00:49:29.933]  You don't like them putting out lists of citizens to be snatched and grabbed off the street?
[00:49:30.433 --> 00:49:34.377]  Oh, you don't like them lobbying to have, you know, Ohio ban people's rallies?
[00:49:34.878 --> 00:49:36.460]  Oh, well you must be a racist.
[00:49:38.496 --> 00:49:39.197]  See how that works?
[00:49:39.837 --> 00:49:41.239]  But it doesn't work anymore, dude.
[00:49:41.479 --> 00:49:46.543]  No, people are realizing that it's all a bunch of BS.
[00:49:47.024 --> 00:49:50.267]  The whole racist talk is getting old, and people are seeing through it.
[00:49:50.847 --> 00:49:52.189]  You can go onto the message boards.
[00:49:52.469 --> 00:49:55.672]  Anytime I read an article with a racist slant, I'll go down and read the comments.
[00:49:55.732 --> 00:49:58.274]  People are like, this is not really happening.
[00:49:58.554 --> 00:50:00.977]  Tea partiers are not racist people.
[00:50:00.997 --> 00:50:01.797]  They're people fed up.
[00:50:02.418 --> 00:50:03.719]  Because they're being taxed too much.
[00:50:03.739 --> 00:50:04.940]  They want to spend their money.
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:10.424]  Well, the feds are sending racists in and they can always find some camp follower useful idiots to be part of that.
[00:50:10.624 --> 00:50:10.864]  Oh yeah.
[00:50:10.924 --> 00:50:12.505]  No, we're against corruption.
[00:50:12.765 --> 00:50:13.406]  Look at history.
[00:50:13.766 --> 00:50:16.368]  The Chinese government's always corrupt throughout history.
[00:50:17.269 --> 00:50:18.830]  The British government, constantly corrupt.
[00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:21.712]  The German government, the French government, the Japanese government.
[00:50:22.252 --> 00:50:24.093]  This is corruption we're fighting.
[00:50:24.214 --> 00:50:26.355]  They make the Italian mafia look like a little league.
[00:50:26.415 --> 00:50:27.036]  They really do.
[00:50:27.396 --> 00:50:30.378]  The amount of government corruption that's out there now, it's just, it's insane.
[00:50:30.618 --> 00:50:42.703]  And they've gotten away with it and they run all the main regulators to the point that Bloomberg can come out and put out reports where the major insurance companies made a deal with the government ten years ago to steal six million veterans' death benefits.
[00:50:43.043 --> 00:50:45.524]  And the government says, we changed the rule, we're allowed to steal your money.
[00:50:46.285 --> 00:50:51.347]  And then you protest it and they'll have an Israeli mob group spy on your butt.
[00:50:52.148 --> 00:50:52.328]  Yeah.
[00:50:52.788 --> 00:50:54.649]  I mean, people should be going out and protesting anyway.
[00:50:54.689 --> 00:50:55.009]  No, no, no.
[00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:55.830]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:50:56.570 --> 00:51:00.712]  The mafia today is just government agencies and private contractors.
[00:51:00.933 --> 00:51:03.294]  Are the threats of a biological attack to the U.S.
[00:51:03.374 --> 00:51:03.674]  real?
[00:51:03.814 --> 00:51:08.577]  If biological warfare is real, what should I know before it happens to protect my family?
[00:51:08.777 --> 00:51:17.161]  The answers to the unthinkable are inside a new book by Christian patriot and author Sam Adams, Pale Horse, How to Survive a Chemical or Biological Attack.
[00:51:17.481 --> 00:51:36.365]  Inside what's been called the must-have manual for surviving the attack and mass panic that will follow, you will learn what the actual biological and chemical threats are, how to respond to events that are almost certain to happen, what the government's response is likely to be, how some will take advantage of the chaos, and exactly how you should prepare to get pale-horsed.
[00:51:36.485 --> 00:51:38.206]  This is not your father's Biowar Survival Handbook.
[00:52:00.891 --> 00:52:05.753]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:52:05.853 --> 00:52:06.633]  What have we got?
[00:52:06.853 --> 00:52:08.994]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:52:09.294 --> 00:52:10.035]  A republic.
[00:52:10.295 --> 00:52:12.896]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:52:12.956 --> 00:52:14.856]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:52:15.217 --> 00:52:17.117]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:52:17.237 --> 00:52:18.518]  So they think they own our land?
[00:52:18.918 --> 00:52:20.038]  They think they own our water?
[00:52:20.239 --> 00:52:20.639]  Children?
[00:52:20.839 --> 00:52:21.619]  Our education?
[00:52:21.979 --> 00:52:22.619]  Our money?
[00:52:22.799 --> 00:52:26.441]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:52:26.821 --> 00:52:31.467]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:52:31.787 --> 00:52:32.608]  We have the facts.
[00:52:32.828 --> 00:52:33.929]  We have the Constitution.
[00:52:33.989 --> 00:52:34.871]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:52:34.891 --> 00:52:35.712]  We have common law.
[00:52:35.772 --> 00:52:38.034]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:38.295 --> 00:52:42.079]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:52:42.179 --> 00:52:46.985]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:52:47.146 --> 00:52:48.507]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:52:48.647 --> 00:52:49.469]  Don't tread on me.

[00:53:02.605 --> 00:53:04.046]  What is a wind generator?
[00:53:04.347 --> 00:53:06.449]  How can the wind produce power for a small cabin?
[00:53:06.749 --> 00:53:09.752]  How can wind energy be stored and used during an emergency?
[00:53:10.113 --> 00:53:12.055]  Can I assemble my own wind generator?

[00:54:17.042 --> 00:54:19.543]  Let me read over some of this counterpunch article.
[00:54:20.883 --> 00:54:22.144]  This is from the mid-1990s.
[00:54:22.304 --> 00:54:27.045]  In fact, we'll give you a video screenshot of this if you're a PrisonPlanet.tv viewer.
[00:54:27.485 --> 00:54:32.287]  The headline is, We're the Spies Journalist, the ADL snoops.
[00:54:33.356 --> 00:54:37.980]  And it goes on to say, the ADL claims to be the nation's leading defender against prejudice and bigotry.
[00:54:38.521 --> 00:54:43.546]  But in this incident, targets were members of the African National Congress and its supporters.
[00:54:43.906 --> 00:54:48.631]  And apparently everyone, Arab and non-Arab, who had the temerity to criticize Israel.
[00:54:49.051 --> 00:55:06.168]  This includes some who drove to Arab community events where the ADL's fact finder, Roy Bullock, and the cop, Tom Girard, this is just one case of many, took turns writing down their license plates, which Girard, in turn, ran the addresses through the California Motor Vehicles record.
[00:55:06.208 --> 00:55:06.748]  That's illegal.
[00:55:07.429 --> 00:55:16.735]  The spying efforts proved to be part of a much larger intelligence-gathering operation targeting some 12,000 individuals and more than 600 left-of-center organizations in Northern California.
[00:55:17.215 --> 00:55:23.319]  After the first flurry of publicity, the ADL spin doctor successfully kept the story from receiving the national coverage that the situation warranted.
[00:55:23.539 --> 00:55:24.780]  But the story hasn't gone away.
[00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:33.969]  Last November, the California Court of Appeals handed down a decision that paves the way for a major test later this year of the ADL's penchant for spying on its enemies.
[00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:39.376]  It was the most significant episode in a slow-moving class action suit filed in 93.
[00:55:39.476 --> 00:55:43.941]  And then it just goes on from there, and all the other police departments where it was going on.
[00:55:44.782 --> 00:55:44.922]  Now...
[00:55:47.950 --> 00:55:56.213]  We now, fast forward to 2010, Pennsylvania Homeland Security employed Israeli company to suppress American political speech.
[00:55:57.733 --> 00:56:04.515]  And it turns out at the G20, they would finger a group who they were spying on, left, right, didn't matter, then they would send SWAT teams to arrest them.
[00:56:05.916 --> 00:56:14.918]  And now, this year, they've been caught $125,000 to spy on Tea Party groups, and then list them as potential terrorists.
[00:56:15.659 --> 00:56:16.919]  Mainline Tea Parties.
[00:56:19.893 --> 00:56:25.899]  And they've got the nation reporting Blackwater's doing similar things, now known as XC.
[00:56:26.639 --> 00:56:27.680]  It is a free-for-all.
[00:56:27.740 --> 00:56:42.293]  There are tens of billions of dollars conservatively spent every year for defense contractors to have HUMET, human intelligence on the ground, digital intelligence, surveillance, and they're just in there spying on everybody.
[00:56:42.353 --> 00:56:43.835]  And it's so illegal.
[00:56:45.063 --> 00:56:49.587]  And the governor's now apologizing, saying, oh, this is illegal, I'm sorry, and lawsuits are flying.
[00:56:50.027 --> 00:56:51.228]  All of this is going on.
[00:56:52.169 --> 00:56:57.233]  And in mainline environmental groups, land rights groups, you're all being spied on.
[00:56:57.413 --> 00:56:58.494]  But don't let that scare you.
[00:56:58.935 --> 00:57:10.164]  The bad guys are spying on you because they know that you know that the government's out of control, and that different mafias have come in and bought off the Congress, and it's a free-for-all.
[00:57:12.051 --> 00:57:15.895]  See, we've always had corruption, but now it's really going to seed.
[00:57:16.216 --> 00:57:18.278]  We're going to go to Brighton, come back and cover some more news.
[00:57:18.318 --> 00:57:23.604]  Then Dr. Sherry Tenpenny is joining us, can really save some lives by exposing the new flu hoax they're pushing.
[00:57:23.824 --> 00:57:26.927]  Can you guys print me some articles on pregnant women told to take vaccine?
[00:57:26.968 --> 00:57:27.248]  Thank you.
[00:57:27.268 --> 00:57:27.969]  Or maybe in my folder.
[00:57:28.009 --> 00:57:28.189]  Thanks.
[00:57:28.209 --> 00:57:29.110]  It's in my folder.
[00:57:29.130 --> 00:57:29.390]  Thank you.
[00:57:30.231 --> 00:57:31.833]  I want to tell you about Inner Health Botanicals.
[00:57:31.853 --> 00:57:38.879]  You know, being under all this chemical and biological assault, vitamins and nutrients and minerals and key co-factors are absolutely essential.

[00:59:55.948 --> 00:59:58.689]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.376 --> 01:00:09.559]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover Ups.
[01:00:10.199 --> 01:00:11.020]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:12.721]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.361 --> 01:00:16.984]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.544 --> 01:00:21.647]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.368 --> 01:00:28.872]  You know, I covered this in the Masters of Terror nine years ago.
[01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:45.933]  But in an upcoming film, the one on the Tea Party and Glenn Beck and everybody, I'm going to document how they fund the radical racist black groups, the radical racist Hispanic groups, the radical white supremacist type groups.
[01:00:46.073 --> 01:00:48.874]  I'm going to document all of that in the film.
[01:00:48.954 --> 01:00:50.154]  Because it's all mainstream news.
[01:00:50.214 --> 01:00:51.554]  It comes out here, it comes out there.
[01:00:51.894 --> 01:00:54.515]  It's just never a big national news story.
[01:00:55.455 --> 01:01:01.042]  So you tell the average person that the Ku Klux Klan's fed run, that the white supremacist groups, in every major case.
[01:01:02.444 --> 01:01:07.490]  I mean, I've gone out to these Klan rallies and bullhorned them, and you're looking at them and they're all a bunch of cops, and later it comes out they aren't.
[01:01:07.650 --> 01:01:09.052]  They're laughing, they're joking.
[01:01:09.493 --> 01:01:11.996]  It's a way to then call for getting rid of the First Amendment.
[01:01:13.584 --> 01:01:30.679]  And the reason this ADL thing and Southern Poverty Law Center situation is so important, if you just joined us, the admissions that Pennsylvania Homeland Security employed Israeli company with big ADL connections to suppress American political speech and spy illegally on citizens and list them as terrorists.
[01:01:31.259 --> 01:01:33.561]  And the governor's apologizing, saying it is illegal.
[01:01:34.182 --> 01:01:35.103]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:01:36.124 --> 01:01:37.686]  We can't have offshore groups.
[01:01:37.746 --> 01:01:42.672]  I don't care if they're German, Chinese, Israeli, Japanese.
[01:01:43.193 --> 01:01:45.636]  This is mafia, and we cannot have this.
[01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:48.099]  It's government-sanctioned gang behavior.
[01:01:49.261 --> 01:01:51.062]  To then politically demonize groups.
[01:01:51.303 --> 01:01:53.765]  And I'm in a lot of danger, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:54.625 --> 01:02:00.950]  Many white supremacist leaders who've been confirmed later to be feds, and I can always listen to them and tell if they're feds, because they're going off a script.
[01:02:01.391 --> 01:02:08.096]  Just like when Beck three years ago was demonizing patriots and Ron Paul two and a half years ago, I knew it was a script because I'd seen the exact nomenclature.
[01:02:11.222 --> 01:02:12.363]  So again, they play all the angles.
[01:02:12.423 --> 01:02:13.845]  The left, the right, the conservative.
[01:02:14.125 --> 01:02:15.647]  And maybe Beck isn't bad.
[01:02:15.687 --> 01:02:17.368]  Maybe somebody loaded that in his teleprompter.
[01:02:18.269 --> 01:02:19.891]  I want to be careful about judging people.
[01:02:20.871 --> 01:02:23.434]  But the issue here is, I know it when I see it.
[01:02:23.594 --> 01:02:24.495]  I know it when I hear it.
[01:02:25.115 --> 01:02:29.660]  And within two hours of Poplowski, last year, killing those three cops, being in custody,
[01:02:30.885 --> 01:02:32.047]  The truth was he was drunk.
[01:02:32.327 --> 01:02:33.609]  He got in a second pit bull.
[01:02:33.709 --> 01:02:35.171]  It was going to the bathroom on the floor.
[01:02:35.732 --> 01:02:37.695]  His mother said, I'm calling the cops to evict you.
[01:02:38.116 --> 01:02:38.817]  He threw a fit.
[01:02:38.837 --> 01:02:39.658]  They showed up in minutes.
[01:02:39.678 --> 01:02:40.700]  He shot three of them dead.
[01:02:41.241 --> 01:02:46.348]  Turned out he was all over the white supremacist sites spending his time attacking Alex Jones.
[01:02:47.045 --> 01:02:48.747]  He wasn't a Fed, obviously.
[01:02:48.807 --> 01:02:56.115]  He was a former Marine picking up on the Fed-run white supremacists who were obviously paid to attack Alex Jones.
[01:02:56.375 --> 01:03:06.185]  Because if we have a mainline resistance to this and say, hey, it's wrong for the ADL to be spying on us and breaking the law, but don't make it a thing about bashing Jews in general,
[01:03:06.826 --> 01:03:07.206]  We're good to go.
[01:03:26.755 --> 01:03:27.655]  You saw the evidence.
[01:03:28.035 --> 01:03:34.497]  Five newspapers had to retract within a day because I called him and I said, listen, we searched Poplowski's screen name.
[01:03:34.717 --> 01:03:37.998]  He's attacking me on InfoWars and Prison Planet on the comment boards.
[01:03:38.338 --> 01:03:39.638]  He's attacking me in the forum.
[01:03:39.818 --> 01:03:41.878]  He's attacking me on all these white supremacist sites.
[01:03:42.779 --> 01:03:43.719]  You better retract it.
[01:03:44.639 --> 01:03:48.360]  Because they were in the news saying Alex, you know, influenced him to kill cops.
[01:03:49.946 --> 01:03:58.311]  Within two hours of him being in custody, they had people on the news, within minutes, saying, oh yeah, he liked Alex Jones, that's why he did this.
[01:03:58.591 --> 01:03:59.432]  The guy was smiling.
[01:03:59.852 --> 01:04:00.873]  Then the newspapers...
[01:04:02.091 --> 01:04:03.292]  Are already in his computer.
[01:04:03.672 --> 01:04:09.914]  They have a beat reporter who mainly demonizes Patriot groups and glorifies ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:04:10.374 --> 01:04:11.875]  They've got these people all over the place.
[01:04:12.255 --> 01:04:14.896]  We don't know if he's one of their ops or just one of their fellow travelers.
[01:04:15.636 --> 01:04:21.659]  Putting it out that I basically influenced it, which was then picked up and magnified by a whole bunch of other media.
[01:04:22.319 --> 01:04:23.940]  Now, who's their number one enemy?
[01:04:24.943 --> 01:04:25.944]  Who's their number one enemy?
[01:04:26.204 --> 01:04:29.926]  Within two hours of those cops being shot, they weren't even cold yet.
[01:04:30.386 --> 01:04:31.146]  Those poor men.
[01:04:31.727 --> 01:04:32.407]  Yours truly.
[01:04:32.427 --> 01:04:34.428]  Because they want to sick the police out of me.
[01:04:35.489 --> 01:04:37.690]  They want the police to come in here and crack my head open.
[01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:39.611]  They think you're stupid, police.
[01:04:41.272 --> 01:04:42.273]  Now, just remember that.
[01:04:43.773 --> 01:04:45.174]  They want us all at each other's throats.
[01:04:45.214 --> 01:04:49.316]  That's why they fund Mecha and La Raza in movies like Machete, Fox News.
[01:04:49.877 --> 01:04:53.579]  That's why the CIA, on record, New York Observer, funding that mosque.
[01:04:54.946 --> 01:04:55.766]  At ground zero.
[01:04:56.827 --> 01:04:57.687]  They've got a plan.
[01:04:57.787 --> 01:04:59.027]  They want us at each other's throats.
[01:04:59.047 --> 01:04:59.708]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:00.288 --> 01:05:04.509]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:04.829 --> 01:05:05.450]  Number one.
[01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:08.891]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.171 --> 01:05:09.731]  Number two.
[01:05:10.031 --> 01:05:14.573]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:14.913 --> 01:05:15.353]  It's true.
[01:05:15.653 --> 01:05:20.215]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:20.535 --> 01:05:21.055]  Number 3.
[01:05:21.355 --> 01:05:24.636]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:24.936 --> 01:05:28.637]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:28.857 --> 01:05:29.397]  Number 4.
[01:05:29.637 --> 01:05:32.018]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:32.398 --> 01:05:35.799]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:36.079 --> 01:05:36.299]  Number 5.
[01:05:36.879 --> 01:05:40.780]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:45.781]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:46.061 --> 01:05:50.102]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:50.242 --> 01:05:51.803]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:52.023 --> 01:05:54.123]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:05:54.283 --> 01:05:56.864]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:05:56.884 --> 01:06:00.725]  Listen up, friends.
[01:06:00.765 --> 01:06:02.726]  This is Alex Jones with key information.
[01:06:03.106 --> 01:06:06.627]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[01:06:06.907 --> 01:06:09.508]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[01:06:09.768 --> 01:06:14.792]  You need to get your own supply of high-quality, storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[01:06:15.152 --> 01:06:16.674]  They're the best company out there.
[01:06:16.914 --> 01:06:20.817]  The longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.
[01:06:21.097 --> 01:06:23.139]  It's all fresh, made on a monthly basis.
[01:06:23.439 --> 01:06:26.461]  Not some old, cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[01:06:26.762 --> 01:06:28.583]  Try their new Evacuation Pack.
[01:06:28.743 --> 01:06:31.065]  A two-week supply of delicious, easy-to-fix food.
[01:06:31.305 --> 01:06:33.427]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it.
[01:06:33.687 --> 01:06:41.633]  With open talk of a strike on Iran in the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations, get yourself and your family ready today.
[01:06:41.993 --> 01:06:44.035]  The place to go is efoodsdirect.com.
[01:06:44.375 --> 01:06:51.861]  Go to their website online right now, efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex, or call 800-409-5633.
[01:06:52.201 --> 01:06:57.265]  Again, on the web, efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex, or give them a call at 800-409-5633.
[01:07:00.407 --> 01:07:05.871]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:07:07.071 --> 01:07:11.855]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:07:12.215 --> 01:07:18.859]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:07:20.941 --> 01:07:23.242]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:07:25.023 --> 01:07:27.145]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:07:29.438 --> 01:07:33.300]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:37.142]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[01:07:37.862 --> 01:07:38.683]  Others don't.
[01:07:39.103 --> 01:07:40.984]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:07:41.244 --> 01:07:42.745]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[01:07:43.025 --> 01:07:45.586]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:07:45.906 --> 01:07:52.170]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:07:52.530 --> 01:07:54.771]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:07:55.231 --> 01:07:57.272]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[01:07:57.612 --> 01:07:58.473]  Others don't.
[01:08:12.748 --> 01:08:21.040]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:28.118 --> 01:08:32.220]  Okay, for the rest of the hour, Dr. Sherry Tenpenny is our guest.
[01:08:33.061 --> 01:08:51.972]  I wanted to briefly announce that this weekend, we're going to shoot a tour of the new studios that are actually now the old studios, where we run the filmmaking, the live radio slash TV show, the news website, web mastering, and where we have our writers.
[01:08:53.393 --> 01:08:59.675]  But we were able to get really inexpensively, compared to most square footage in Austin, the space near to us.
[01:09:00.355 --> 01:09:01.396]  In fact, right next door.
[01:09:02.156 --> 01:09:09.619]  And in the last year, we were able to, it was an empty warehouse, as cheaply as possible, build it.
[01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:12.500]  And so we've got the skeleton of the
[01:09:14.102 --> 01:09:15.263]  Studio completed.
[01:09:15.323 --> 01:09:18.244]  Now we need to buy the equipment, the computers, hire at least three people.
[01:09:18.564 --> 01:09:26.708]  We're launching a big social network that, with the in-house servers we bought and with the IT company that built it, is coming in at about $100,000.
[01:09:27.388 --> 01:09:32.671]  And quite frankly, you know, selling videos, sponsors, all of it.
[01:09:33.571 --> 01:09:36.472]  We have a shortfall in being able to hurry up and launch this.
[01:09:36.572 --> 01:09:41.573]  I could take my time and take another year to take the profits we have and slowly build it.
[01:09:41.973 --> 01:09:47.795]  But I don't want to spend the six-month emergency backup reserves we have in case we go into total complete collapse.
[01:09:48.355 --> 01:09:50.356]  Then we'd be off the air if I spend our reserves.
[01:09:50.916 --> 01:09:53.939]  So, we weren't going to have a Money Bomb this year because I thought we'd have enough money.
[01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:56.262]  We've done two in the past, very successful.
[01:09:57.023 --> 01:09:58.424]  We normally do it at the beginning of the summer.
[01:09:58.864 --> 01:09:59.785]  Obviously, it's the fall.
[01:10:00.146 --> 01:10:05.431]  We're going to have the 2010 Money Bomb, and we'll put that website up on screen.
[01:10:09.654 --> 01:10:10.814]  We want to raise $500,000.
[01:10:10.974 --> 01:10:23.220]  That will allow us for a year to budget three to four staff members to pay for the social network and to buy the high-def cameras and the computer switcher.
[01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:26.701]  And we're buying about the most least expensive that we can.
[01:10:27.301 --> 01:10:28.702]  It's prosumer stuff.
[01:10:29.102 --> 01:10:31.603]  If you buy anything below that, it has endless problems.
[01:10:33.484 --> 01:10:40.547]  I'm going to develop daily video reports for PrisonPlanet.TV members that are given to you first and put out on YouTube for everyone.
[01:10:40.987 --> 01:10:46.509]  I'm going to develop an hour-long weekly television show that we're going to put on DirecTV and Dish Network.
[01:10:46.729 --> 01:10:48.370]  We made those inquiries a year and a half ago.
[01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:49.050]  We can do that.
[01:10:50.611 --> 01:10:57.813]  And we're going to, again, not being backed by Fox News, not being backed by the big foundations, we are backed by you, the listeners.
[01:10:58.253 --> 01:11:01.755]  And what they do with hundreds of millions of dollars, we can do with
[01:11:02.754 --> 01:11:07.959]  A quarter million maybe, half a million we can definitely get it turbocharged and completed.
[01:11:08.279 --> 01:11:26.656]  Again, when you're a small organization and move from 4,000 square feet to 7,400 two years ago, and we had to build this and fund this and do what we've done here, and then we had to negotiate the lease because it wasn't available at first, then the city held us up for about six months not giving us permits,
[01:11:27.717 --> 01:11:28.978]  I guess they weren't harassing us.
[01:11:29.018 --> 01:11:33.880]  I'm told they do this to everybody now in Austin because it's a green city where they don't like building and jobs.
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:36.861]  And we finally got the thing built.
[01:11:38.541 --> 01:11:40.762]  And it's not as nice as this office.
[01:11:40.822 --> 01:11:42.183]  It's pretty bare bones.
[01:11:42.323 --> 01:11:43.624]  It looks like an army barracks.
[01:11:43.744 --> 01:11:44.864]  This office isn't fancy.
[01:11:45.744 --> 01:11:48.125]  But those are nice metal doors.
[01:11:48.145 --> 01:11:49.906]  We've got cheap wood doors, things like that.
[01:11:49.986 --> 01:11:54.288]  It's the kind of office where you don't want to bump the wall with your elbow because your arm will go right through it.
[01:11:57.581 --> 01:12:02.205]  Well, anyways, the point is, is that it's got a lot of space for us, though.
[01:12:02.506 --> 01:12:04.327]  We've tried to budget as well as we could.
[01:12:04.667 --> 01:12:05.969]  We appreciate all your support.
[01:12:06.089 --> 01:12:08.831]  NPR will do months of begging for money every year.
[01:12:09.171 --> 01:12:14.116]  The federal government gives billions to mainstream media and product placement, propaganda placement.
[01:12:14.136 --> 01:12:15.397]  They call it behavior placement.
[01:12:16.218 --> 01:12:17.339]  We don't have that funding.
[01:12:17.419 --> 01:12:18.259]  You are our funding.
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:21.102]  And so please go to the new website, in fact, the URL.
[01:12:22.623 --> 01:12:22.763]  Yes.
[01:12:41.172 --> 01:12:41.473]  I think so.
[01:12:57.574 --> 01:12:57.834]  That's right.
[01:13:20.231 --> 01:13:20.331]  Yeah.
[01:13:35.299 --> 01:13:44.423]  And all of this has been organically growing while we're doing the news websites, while we're making films, while we're going out in the field, while we're doing all of this.
[01:13:44.483 --> 01:13:54.007]  And we're trying to grow the team, we're trying to keep the people we've got, because we've tripled our audience the last year, doubled it the year before that, but because the economy's in a depression, funds are down.
[01:13:54.827 --> 01:13:59.529]  If I was where I was two years ago, I wouldn't even need to do this Money Bomb now to be able to do this.
[01:13:59.649 --> 01:14:02.651]  But we have to, and so I want to thank you for your support.
[01:14:02.911 --> 01:14:07.693]  And the date of it is October 14th, so a little less than a month.
[01:14:08.133 --> 01:14:11.315]  And I'm going to do a 24-hour broadcast that day.
[01:14:11.335 --> 01:14:14.296]  24-hour, it'll be up on the bird if stations want it.
[01:14:14.676 --> 01:14:18.058]  I'll do the regular, you know, three to four hours that's slotted in there.
[01:14:18.678 --> 01:14:22.259]  And we're going to have special interviews, special guests, a lot of footage that's never been seen before.
[01:14:22.299 --> 01:14:25.440]  We'll be streaming the audio and video at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:27.241]  So we're going to go 24 hours.
[01:14:27.941 --> 01:14:28.881]  In fact, I'm thinking about doing 25.
[01:14:29.521 --> 01:14:33.262]  So the next day when I go live, I'll do one more hour live and then go crash.
[01:14:33.823 --> 01:14:35.663]  And so that is coming up.
[01:14:36.563 --> 01:14:36.943]  Okay.
[01:14:37.864 --> 01:14:38.924]  Shifting gears now.
[01:14:39.924 --> 01:14:41.625]  We've got a chance to save a lot of lives.
[01:14:42.924 --> 01:14:53.412]  Last year, when the whole flu scare started, Dr. Sherry Tinpenny pointed out it came up in the wrong hemisphere, wrong time of year, was a novel, meaning it had no pedigree, flu virus.
[01:14:53.913 --> 01:14:56.315]  A lot of other scientists said it was clearly manufactured in a lab.
[01:14:56.675 --> 01:14:58.857]  There were a lot of deaths associated with the testing of it.
[01:14:59.957 --> 01:15:05.180]  She and other medical doctors and brain surgeons like Dr. Blaylock said it's going to cause Guillain-Barre.
[01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:06.400]  It's going to cause epilepsy.
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:07.761]  It's going to cause narcolepsy.
[01:15:07.781 --> 01:15:12.783]  Because they knew what had happened in the past with the adjuvants causing an autoimmune response in the body.
[01:15:13.603 --> 01:15:15.604]  Not just in the brain, but in the pancreas and other areas.
[01:15:16.165 --> 01:15:19.646]  Now, it's all been confirmed in triplicate.
[01:15:20.126 --> 01:15:21.107]  Here's the London Telegraph.
[01:15:21.974 --> 01:15:23.215]  Flu shot suspended.
[01:15:23.696 --> 01:15:28.380]  Caused a tenfold increase in violent seizures, convulsions.
[01:15:28.841 --> 01:15:31.964]  Headline, flu jab linked to fits in under fives.
[01:15:32.985 --> 01:15:33.805]  Shot suspended.
[01:15:34.795 --> 01:15:39.200]  I've had the British Medical Journal editor on saying it was all a giant payoff operation and deadly.
[01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:45.507]  I've had Wolfgang Wudarg, the head of the EU Health Commission, a doctor, saying they conclusively found it was deadly and a fraud.
[01:15:46.628 --> 01:15:55.337]  Now they're back wanting to add it to the regular seasonal flu shot, and I wanted to get Dr. Sherry Tenpenny on to warn ahead of this this year, because they're all over the news.
[01:15:55.397 --> 01:15:55.818]  Here it is.
[01:15:56.218 --> 01:16:11.166]  Medical groups urge flu shots for pregnant women when their own inserts say pregnant women shouldn't take it because of all sorts of documented histories of causing miscarriages, brain damage, deformity, because it causes an autoimmune response and the woman miscarries.
[01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:17.381]  So, Dr. Sherry Tenpenny of drtenpenny.com joins us.
[01:16:18.022 --> 01:16:20.662]  I salute your work, your bold courage last year.
[01:16:20.982 --> 01:16:27.084]  You have been vindicated in triplicate with a royal flush, and we salute your courage, Dr. Tenpenny.
[01:16:27.504 --> 01:16:29.044]  Thank you, Alex, and good afternoon.
[01:16:29.084 --> 01:16:30.665]  How are you?
[01:16:30.785 --> 01:16:40.087]  It's good to have you here, but we had record numbers of people refuse the flu shot last year, so we had record numbers not getting the flu as the evidence shows it actually causes it, but they're back again.
[01:16:41.383 --> 01:16:45.184]  Yeah, they're back again this year in a really big way and they're pushing it bigger than ever.
[01:16:45.204 --> 01:16:55.867]  In fact, there are at least 50 healthcare systems across the country right now that have documented that they are now requiring flu shots in exchange for employment.
[01:16:56.328 --> 01:17:10.872]  And there are at least 50 different hospital systems across the country that have adapted that, even though I've proven unequivocally in all the materials that you and I've talked about in the new DVD that I'm putting out called Flu and flu vaccines was coming in that needle.
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:17.265]  All of those things have proven to be ineffective, and yet they are now saying that you have to get a flu shot in order to have a job.
[01:17:17.566 --> 01:17:24.092]  And they always said, oh, we're not going to try to force you to take it, but they tried to make medical workers, police, take the smallpox eight years ago.
[01:17:24.472 --> 01:17:31.839]  Last year they tried to make medical workers take it outside of law, and now they're doing it covertly, saying you want a job, you've got to take it.
[01:17:32.139 --> 01:17:34.300]  That's right, and it's getting more.
[01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:35.460]  We hear about this every day.
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:42.442]  I probably get several hundred emails a week about people in healthcare systems wanting to know what they can do to refuse this.
[01:17:43.102 --> 01:17:58.986]  Back in July, I started posting on my Facebook fan page every day saying, this is coming, you guys need to get organized, you need to get all of the people who are on the same side as you about not getting the flu shot, getting the information out to your HR directors and your hospital administrators that this doesn't work.
[01:17:59.617 --> 01:18:02.378]  I've been trying to tell people since July that this was coming.
[01:18:02.798 --> 01:18:24.102]  Well now that the flu shots are here and it's soon to be October and they're saying you have to either show us a medical exemption written on the letterhead of your doctor and have your doctor's signature on it or have some really good reason for why you shouldn't take this flu shot and some hospitals are allowing a religious exemption but not a philosophical exemption.
[01:18:24.582 --> 01:18:28.483]  I think it's going to be really hard for a lot of people to avoid this vaccine this fall.
[01:18:30.205 --> 01:18:35.261]  And last year, we saw incredible medical problems for many of the medical workers that did take it.
[01:18:36.075 --> 01:18:36.795]  Yes, we did.
[01:18:36.875 --> 01:18:43.459]  We saw a lot of people, like you already mentioned in your brief there, about how many pregnant women that ended up having miscarriages.
[01:18:43.519 --> 01:19:04.789]  I've heard that the number was more than 3,500 that were actually reported that we know about, that people that had normal developing fetuses, they went in and had a normal ultrasound that afternoon, got a flu shot, which was the H1N1 vaccine, and within days they had had a dead baby living in their belly that had to go through a miscarriage.
[01:19:05.253 --> 01:19:23.589]  And what's really interesting is the fact that they have now shown that if you had swine flu last year, if you had total recovery from it, that 90% of patients have what conventional medicine would call a protective antibody, which would be enough to keep you from getting the flu again this year if you've been re-exposed.
[01:19:23.649 --> 01:19:26.532]  I mean, that's been reported and documented in the medical literature.
[01:19:27.092 --> 01:19:39.115]  And even with that, they have taken the H1N1 virus, they have incorporated it into the regular seasonal flu shot, and they're saying we need to vaccinate you again just because you may not have had it last year and you may not be exposed.
[01:19:39.956 --> 01:19:47.138]  So we've got mega big pharma companies setting the precedent worldwide to forcibly inject Americans
[01:19:48.278 --> 01:19:49.940]  And this isn't even really in the news.
[01:19:50.001 --> 01:19:54.386]  It's all being done by stealth because they know how unpopular and illegal this is.
[01:19:54.826 --> 01:19:57.550]  They want to isolate people and do it individually to them.
[01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:59.012]  Stay with us, Dr. Sherry Tenpenny.
[01:20:00.871 --> 01:20:02.012]  This may surprise you.
[01:20:02.232 --> 01:20:06.455]  Type 2 diabetes has reached epidemic proportions among both adults and children.
[01:20:06.735 --> 01:20:08.376]  You or someone you know may have it.
[01:20:08.536 --> 01:20:12.139]  Managing type 2 diabetes in conventional ways is a never-ending task.
[01:20:12.299 --> 01:20:14.621]  But this good news may also surprise you.
[01:20:14.821 --> 01:20:20.185]  A recent UCLA study proved that type 2 diabetes can be reversed in only 21 days.
[01:20:20.425 --> 01:20:27.890]  Puriam Health Products recently developed a product that mimics the healthy diet used in that UCLA study called Scoop of Greens, an easy

[01:23:49.395 --> 01:23:49.795]  Mention GCN.

[01:23:50.976 --> 01:23:51.376]  It works!
[01:24:12.657 --> 01:24:17.100]  I cannot stress to you the magnitude of this, the importance.
[01:24:19.281 --> 01:24:29.568]  In this stack of news that I'm going to be going over with Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, we have the Rockefeller Foundation's own documents where they created vaccines added to tetanus to sterilize women.
[01:24:30.475 --> 01:24:32.777]  That they want to use vaccines covertly to do this.
[01:24:32.817 --> 01:24:34.438]  There is no doubt that's what's going on.
[01:24:34.978 --> 01:24:46.007]  Now from my medical research, and I want the doctor to correct me, but globally the average is about one-tenth of already approved drugs, adverse reactions get reported.
[01:24:47.228 --> 01:24:49.589]  When it's something new, it's more like 2%.
[01:24:50.770 --> 01:24:58.236]  So if she's saying over 3,000 women had miscarriages, and that was in the US, the news was everywhere, and this is now admitted, that it causes it.
[01:24:59.923 --> 01:25:01.264]  Then what are the real numbers?
[01:25:01.324 --> 01:25:01.925]  Is it more like 30,000?
[01:25:02.025 --> 01:25:05.588]  Dr. Tenpenny, am I correct that about one-tenth get reported?
[01:25:06.308 --> 01:25:17.778]  That's been the standard for years, Alex, that they've talked about, that less than 10% of adverse events, whether it's from a shot or whether it's from a medication, actually get reported to the government.
[01:25:17.918 --> 01:25:21.481]  So those numbers can be astronomical.
[01:25:22.365 --> 01:25:24.186]  So you're absolutely correct.
[01:25:24.206 --> 01:25:25.767]  Less than 10% were reported.
[01:25:25.787 --> 01:25:28.489]  And let's say that 3,500 was 10%.
[01:25:28.909 --> 01:25:38.474]  That means that 35,000 people actually had miscarriages and lost children because of this flu shot that has been proven to not work in all three age populations.
[01:25:38.754 --> 01:25:41.496]  I know a bunch of women who had miscarriages after they took it.
[01:25:41.896 --> 01:25:42.336]  Oh, wow.
[01:25:42.556 --> 01:25:46.498]  I mean, I'm in restaurants and hear women going, yeah, two days after I lost the baby.
[01:25:46.719 --> 01:25:47.699]  You think it was the shot?
[01:25:48.199 --> 01:25:49.120]  I mean, it's just everywhere.
[01:25:49.983 --> 01:25:54.266]  You know, what's really interesting, Alex, is that I've pulled out a lot of material from the CDC.
[01:25:54.326 --> 01:25:56.608]  As you know, that's where my research all comes from.
[01:25:57.028 --> 01:26:06.535]  Comes from either from pouring through the CDC's documents or from pouring through the medical literature and pulling out things that don't make the mainstream news.
[01:26:07.293 --> 01:26:11.676]  And that each year, they test people for influenza.
[01:26:11.696 --> 01:26:23.083]  So if you've got the flu or flu-like symptoms and you go to the doctor, there are testing stations all across the country that will take a nasal swab and a throat swab and send that to the CDC and say, what is causing this illness?
[01:26:23.812 --> 01:26:48.364]  More than 86% of the time, it's being caused by something other than influenza, which means that, from my information, of all the numbers that I've pulled out, in any given flu season, since 1999, all the way up to for the last 10-11 years, the circulating amount, the amount of influenza out there, the virus that actually causes the flu, only causes the flu 13% of the time.
[01:26:50.117 --> 01:26:57.723]  So that means that if you get a flu shot, and if it worked at all by their numbers, it means that it would only keep you from getting sick 13% of the time.
[01:26:59.024 --> 01:27:05.548]  So we've got this roaring, raging machine that's trying to push these vaccines, the flu shot, on everybody.
[01:27:05.949 --> 01:27:08.210]  Whether it's on just the general public, you know, everybody.
[01:27:08.250 --> 01:27:10.292]  Now we're starting, always before.
[01:27:11.201 --> 01:27:12.903]  We had different flu shots.
[01:27:12.923 --> 01:27:15.365]  There's eight different flu shots that are on the market now.
[01:27:15.485 --> 01:27:16.406]  Eight different flu shots.
[01:27:16.866 --> 01:27:19.829]  Each of them have different ingredients and they're by different manufacturers.
[01:27:20.309 --> 01:27:31.600]  And I can assure you that the doctors that are giving these flu shots, the doctors and the pediatricians and the public health nurses have not gone through those package inserts and have not looked at all the different ingredients per each one of the flu shots.
[01:27:32.181 --> 01:27:42.539]  But now, this year, for the first time ever, the CDC is saying that every person in the United States, starting at six months of age and every year for the rest of their lives, should be given a flu shot.
[01:27:43.496 --> 01:27:52.879]  And they also say that the viruses that are in the flu shot have to be a match to the ones that are out there in the circulation to develop an antibody to protect you from getting sick.
[01:27:53.379 --> 01:28:06.783]  But if the vast majority of flu-like illness that happens in the winter only happens by 13% of the viruses, why are we spending billions of dollars putting lives at risk, putting babies at risk, putting children at risk for something that doesn't
[01:28:08.717 --> 01:28:09.497]  Well, it's simple.
[01:28:09.557 --> 01:28:14.738]  The system of eugenicists want to set the precedent to put in your body what they want, when they want.
[01:28:14.798 --> 01:28:21.800]  But what about all the research and evidence and studies I've seen that the flu shot is causing the flu-like symptoms?
[01:28:21.820 --> 01:28:24.781]  And you have the anecdotal, like my mother never got the flu.
[01:28:24.841 --> 01:28:30.822]  She took the flu shot probably 15 years ago for a triathlon she was about to run because they recommended it.
[01:28:30.922 --> 01:28:33.123]  I mean, she was deathly ill for like a month.
[01:28:33.743 --> 01:28:34.964]  And then she never took it again.
[01:28:34.984 --> 01:28:39.767]  And then we see record numbers not taking the flu shot last year because they saw through the hoax.
[01:28:40.087 --> 01:28:41.869]  And so we had a record low flu season.
[01:28:42.209 --> 01:28:44.871]  So, I mean, there's a lot of evidence there that the flu shot's causing it.
[01:28:45.631 --> 01:28:58.200]  Well, the flu shot has, as part of its package insert, it talks about the fact that the side effects can be achiness, runny nose, watery eyes, fever, chills, headache.
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:28:59.601]  Now, what does that sound like?
[01:28:59.841 --> 01:29:02.163]  The side effects are exactly the same thing as the flu.
[01:29:02.856 --> 01:29:12.299]  And when you look at what's in all of these flu shots, and the main things that I think are very important, is that there are measurable amounts, microgram amounts of formaldehyde.
[01:29:12.639 --> 01:29:15.240]  So there's measurable amounts of formaldehyde in these flu shots.
[01:29:15.620 --> 01:29:20.662]  There's gelatin in some of the flu shots, and the gelatin is known to cross-react to cause food allergies.
[01:29:21.002 --> 01:29:31.305]  The gelatin has been shown in several of the vaccines, like gelatin is also in the chickenpox vaccine and in the shingles vaccine, and in some of the flu shots.
[01:29:33.285 --> 01:29:37.187]  Stay there, we gotta go to break.
[01:29:37.227 --> 01:29:38.167]  Long segment coming up.
[01:29:38.207 --> 01:29:43.570]  Let's continue with what's in these vaccines and what we know it caused last year.
[01:29:43.630 --> 01:29:44.631]  I mean, it's on record.
[01:29:44.811 --> 01:29:49.574]  Massive brain damage, all sorts of different neurological disorders, miscarriages, you name it.
[01:29:51.014 --> 01:29:51.915]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.415 --> 01:29:54.016]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.936 --> 01:29:57.618]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:59.670 --> 01:32:03.893]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:04.213 --> 01:32:04.814]  Number 1.
[01:32:05.134 --> 01:32:08.276]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:08.557 --> 01:32:09.117]  Number 2.
[01:32:09.417 --> 01:32:13.961]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:14.301 --> 01:32:14.741]  It's true.
[01:32:15.041 --> 01:32:19.605]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:19.925 --> 01:32:20.465]  Number 3.
[01:32:20.746 --> 01:32:24.028]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:24.328 --> 01:32:28.031]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:28.231 --> 01:32:28.772]  Number 4.
[01:32:29.032 --> 01:32:31.395]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:31.795 --> 01:32:35.179]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:35.479 --> 01:32:35.679]  Number 5.
[01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:40.184]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:40.405 --> 01:32:45.170]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:45.450 --> 01:32:49.492]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:49.632 --> 01:32:51.192]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:51.413 --> 01:32:53.513]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:32:53.674 --> 01:32:56.275]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:32:56.295 --> 01:33:10.421]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:10.881 --> 01:33:13.422]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:16.974 --> 01:33:19.995]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, medical doctor, is our guest.
[01:33:20.015 --> 01:33:21.775]  We're going back to her in just a moment.
[01:33:23.456 --> 01:33:25.617]  It is a fact that over 3,000 women in the U.S.
[01:33:25.657 --> 01:33:27.317]  had miscarriages from the vaccine.
[01:33:27.897 --> 01:33:28.818]  That is a low number.
[01:33:28.858 --> 01:33:29.218]  You heard her.
[01:33:29.238 --> 01:33:29.798]  It's probably more like 35,000.
[01:33:29.838 --> 01:33:33.039]  There's only about 10% or less get reported.
[01:33:34.775 --> 01:33:36.476]  And we know this is happening all over the world.
[01:33:36.496 --> 01:33:42.098]  The UN has been caught with vaccines that they claim are for tetanus and other things, sterilizing people.
[01:33:42.118 --> 01:33:45.640]  And I'm going to show you some of that directly from the Rockefeller Foundation in a moment.
[01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:47.481]  Yes, this is really going on.
[01:33:48.381 --> 01:33:49.282]  This is really happening.
[01:33:49.662 --> 01:33:51.063]  And now they know you're waking up.
[01:33:51.583 --> 01:33:53.704]  Before, most people got vaccinated so they could...
[01:33:55.649 --> 01:33:57.370]  Not try to make it the law, you've got to take it.
[01:33:57.390 --> 01:33:59.392]  They just used intimidation or claimed it was the law.
[01:33:59.752 --> 01:34:05.616]  Now they're coming trying to actually make people that work in medical centers, police do it, and this stuff's deadly.
[01:34:06.076 --> 01:34:11.560]  One of the biggest reasons I say don't join the military is because they use you as guinea pigs and use experimental vaccines on you.
[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:13.321]  That's illegal even with troops.
[01:34:13.721 --> 01:34:19.685]  They can make you take a non-experimental, but they can't make you take an experimental like smallpox or anthrax, but they do.
[01:34:20.145 --> 01:34:22.147]  We're going back to Sherry Tinpenny here in just a moment.
[01:34:22.427 --> 01:34:25.289]  I want to tell you about a great sponsor, the Power Cop.
[01:34:26.529 --> 01:34:31.712]  Parents, are your kids wasting away hours and hours watching TV or playing computer and video games?
[01:34:32.172 --> 01:34:33.133]  Are their grades slipping?
[01:34:33.513 --> 01:34:35.033]  Is your family time non-existent?
[01:34:35.974 --> 01:34:40.556]  If you answered yes to any of these questions, get control back with the PowerCop.
[01:34:40.616 --> 01:34:46.659]  The PowerCop is an easy-to-use, programmable device that limits the amount of time you allow them to use each day.
[01:34:47.239 --> 01:34:51.221]  It just, that way it plugs right into the TV so there's not all that complex programming and things.
[01:34:51.501 --> 01:34:52.762]  It's just, it's like an alarm clock.
[01:34:53.755 --> 01:34:54.415]  It goes on.
[01:34:54.816 --> 01:34:56.177]  Childhood obesity is on the rise.
[01:34:56.557 --> 01:34:58.838]  Get your kids away from the screen and get them active.
[01:34:59.098 --> 01:35:01.240]  Take back control of your family with the Power Cop.
[01:35:01.500 --> 01:35:02.440]  Give them a call at 800-694-1-COP or C-O-P.
[01:35:02.460 --> 01:35:03.581]  800-694-1-COP or go to thepowercop.com.
[01:35:03.761 --> 01:35:04.822]  One word, thepowercop.com.
[01:35:04.842 --> 01:35:05.062]  800-694-1-COP.
[01:35:18.561 --> 01:35:27.148]  Okay, going back to Sherri Tenpenny, I want you to finish up with what's in the vaccines, what they admit it can do to you, even in the inserts.
[01:35:27.608 --> 01:35:31.931]  We're getting into some of the more horrible side effects, which we know are the actual effects.
[01:35:32.412 --> 01:35:40.718]  But then I want to talk about how much we devastated them last year with the truth, and how we exposed them this year.
[01:35:42.017 --> 01:35:47.362]  Well, Alex, I really want to address all of those things because I think they're really important.
[01:35:47.462 --> 01:35:50.886]  All of the flu shots have different amounts of ingredients in them.
[01:35:50.926 --> 01:35:56.171]  If people go to my website, it's DrTenPenny.com, and click on the tab that says Forms.
[01:35:56.821 --> 01:36:00.824]  A lot of these things are available for free for all of your listeners.
[01:36:01.104 --> 01:36:11.493]  There are downloadable PDF files that have all this documentation about what's in the flu shot, the comparison, how few flu deaths actually happen compared to pneumonia.
[01:36:11.873 --> 01:36:22.021]  There are PDF files up there looking at the pertussis outbreak that happened in California and how few deaths actually happened for pertussis.
[01:36:22.521 --> 01:36:30.945]  All of those are available for free downloads that people can print out and hand out to everybody they know from drtanpenny.com and just click on the forms button.
[01:36:31.445 --> 01:36:43.711]  But one of the things that people rarely talk about, and I've done a whole presentation on this, is the connection between the latex in the stoppers of the vials, not only of the flu shot,
[01:36:44.071 --> 01:36:55.240]  But of all of the other vaccines, those stoppers, the tops of those stoppers that they push the needle through in order to pull the vaccine solution into the syringe, they are latex.
[01:36:55.720 --> 01:37:06.569]  And on the package insert, it says that many people have susceptibility to having severe allergic reactions and even anaphylaxis from that little bit of latex that comes from that stopper.
[01:37:07.150 --> 01:37:08.691]  Now here's the really important part.
[01:37:09.654 --> 01:37:33.439]  is that they have had a synthetic neutral non-allergenic stopper a medical grade stopper available to be using in these vaccines for 62 years Alex for 62 years there has been a safer product available that they have not used and only about half of the vaccines now have synthetic stoppers the other staff have still have latex and
[01:37:33.679 --> 01:37:41.788]  Well, Doc, Doc, that's like Bisphenol A. They've had hundreds of different, really thousands of different plastic combinations that don't leach.
[01:37:42.329 --> 01:37:50.358]  Estrogen mimickers, which they now admit are reducing men's fertility, making women, you know, hyperhormonal, accelerating breast cancer.
[01:37:50.398 --> 01:37:54.783]  That's now all admitted, so we know what these different plastic compounds can do.
[01:37:55.472 --> 01:38:05.014]  Yeah, when I started looking into this latex rubber stopper thing, I thought that what I was going to find was that the serious reactions were coming from the synthetic stoppers.
[01:38:05.154 --> 01:38:05.594]  It isn't.
[01:38:05.714 --> 01:38:07.315]  It's from the latex stoppers.
[01:38:07.715 --> 01:38:18.657]  But what's really important to me is that people need to, if you're going to get a flu shot, or if you know any of your neighbors or anybody else that you know that is going to get a flu shot, it's really important to ask
[01:38:18.957 --> 01:38:21.058]  Your doctor who's ever going to be injecting you.
[01:38:21.138 --> 01:38:22.699]  You want to see that package insert.
[01:38:23.059 --> 01:38:29.143]  You want to make sure that you're getting a mercury-free flu shot because in the multi-dose vials they still have mercury.
[01:38:29.503 --> 01:38:33.205]  You want to make sure that you get a stopper that doesn't have latex in it.
[01:38:33.626 --> 01:38:37.088]  You want to get the smallest amount of dose that you can possibly get away with.
[01:38:37.468 --> 01:38:44.672]  And I think that once people download these things and they hand them out to their friends and neighbors, and once people start seeing it, it goes to your second point, Alex.
[01:38:45.112 --> 01:38:46.813]  And Sherry, let me stop you.
[01:38:46.833 --> 01:38:48.354]  Again, this isn't about being on a power trip.
[01:38:48.374 --> 01:38:49.314]  It's an incredible responsibility.
[01:39:08.225 --> 01:39:19.366]  The millions of people that listen to what you have to say on the hundreds of talk shows you do, including national television, on the millions of listeners and Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com readers that I have, that...
[01:39:20.489 --> 01:39:22.490]  We were able to expose it from the beginning.
[01:39:22.671 --> 01:39:28.315]  We told people the reactions it was going to cause because it was on the insert that it would do this.
[01:39:28.795 --> 01:39:30.096]  Not like we're rocket scientists.
[01:39:30.136 --> 01:39:33.058]  I mean, maybe you are, you're a medical doctor, but I'm no rocket scientist.
[01:39:33.078 --> 01:39:40.323]  If the insert says it, kind of like gasoline canisters say, highly flammable, don't get this on you, don't breathe this, don't light it.
[01:39:40.623 --> 01:39:43.425]  I'm not pouring gasoline on myself and firing it up.
[01:39:43.485 --> 01:39:49.610]  I mean, it doesn't, you know, kind of like firearms say, don't aim this at yourself and, you know, keep the safety on and don't pull the trigger.
[01:39:50.430 --> 01:40:04.506]  I can read those inserts and I can understand what's happening, but to realize just the huge effect that our listeners had, that you had, that all of us had, that we're very close to beating these people.
[01:40:05.467 --> 01:40:13.917]  And that's why they're really turning the heat up this year to try to break our will and force us to take these and force people through color of law to take them.
[01:40:14.278 --> 01:40:15.279]  I mean, this is amazing.
[01:40:15.399 --> 01:40:21.947]  I think that if we can beat them this year again and beat them next year, that they are going to be defeated except for one thing.
[01:40:23.308 --> 01:40:37.214]  Clearly, they are going to, and they've shown they'll do this in the past, release biological pathogens to create a pandemic to say, see, you weren't vaccinated, so some type of weaponized system, you know, will basically be released.
[01:40:37.594 --> 01:40:41.596]  Because, what, the last five years in a row in Asia, in Africa, in Latin America,
[01:40:42.316 --> 01:41:04.991]  On record, the UN gives children polio vaccine that is not just live polio, but one of the deadliest strains, clearly weaponized, and it's killing and maiming them, and it's buried as a footnote, and then they use the spreading of real polio caused by people being given real polio by the vaccine as a pretext to then try to vaccinate more people.
[01:41:05.191 --> 01:41:06.892]  And they admitted that in the CBS article.
[01:41:06.932 --> 01:41:10.815]  Well, this spread it, so they're saying there's even more reason for you to take it.
[01:41:11.215 --> 01:41:27.204]  I see this multi-hundred billion dollar a year industry or more pulling something like this to get this over on us, or hyping things up, like the whooping cough situation, where you've had just a few deaths, but they're hyping it up like it's the end of the world.
[01:41:27.624 --> 01:41:32.567]  And then if we look at the flu shots last year, they hyped up a lot of deaths that weren't caused by the flu.
[01:41:32.927 --> 01:41:35.829]  I wonder how many of these really weren't caused by whooping cough.
[01:41:36.710 --> 01:41:37.771]  Well, that's really true.
[01:41:37.811 --> 01:41:39.992]  I want to comment about what you just said.
[01:41:40.012 --> 01:41:42.974]  The CDC came out with a retraction paper.
[01:41:43.054 --> 01:41:45.936]  They're not calling it a retraction paper, but it kind of is.
[01:41:46.536 --> 01:41:53.600]  You know how every year, for as long as you and I have both been doing this, the mainstream news says, oh yes, 36,000 deaths per year from the flu.
[01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:54.041]  Blah, blah, blah.
[01:41:54.061 --> 01:41:54.301]  36,000 deaths.
[01:41:54.321 --> 01:41:55.021]  36,000 deaths.
[01:41:58.063 --> 01:41:58.503]  We're good to go.
[01:42:22.819 --> 01:42:25.041]  So that's the total amount of flu.
[01:42:25.081 --> 01:42:27.702]  So it isn't anywhere close to 36,000 deaths.
[01:42:28.223 --> 01:42:43.513]  And then when they look at the overall range of the number of incidents of people who've died from the flu since 1976, their range is that on an annual basis, it can range from somewhere from 3,300 people may die up to 49,000 people may die.
[01:42:43.533 --> 01:42:45.074]  I mean, what kind of a range is that?
[01:42:45.414 --> 01:42:50.258]  And even some of the people from the CDC are saying that it's absolutely irrelevant and it means nothing.
[01:42:50.598 --> 01:42:51.298]  Well, that's like Gardashil.
[01:43:20.168 --> 01:43:20.968]  That's like Gardasil.
[01:43:20.988 --> 01:43:30.231]  You might have 3,000 deaths a year from cervical cancer of 300 million people, half of those being women, so 150 million here in the United States.
[01:43:30.271 --> 01:43:31.392]  And I read the medical literature.
[01:43:31.412 --> 01:43:39.054]  They're almost always rundown prostitutes, drug addicts, people with AIDS, people who've survived cancer, people who have diabetes.
[01:43:39.655 --> 01:43:40.875]  Same thing with the flu numbers.
[01:43:41.535 --> 01:43:49.398]  And then they admit on the insert that this can kill you, this can hurt you, and this may not even protect you from the papillomavirus.
[01:43:51.491 --> 01:43:54.175]  There are over a hundred different strains of papillomavirus.
[01:43:54.295 --> 01:44:00.463]  There are six strains, between six and eight strains, that tend to be more carcinogenic.
[01:44:01.129 --> 01:44:09.533]  There are only two strains that are in the Gardasil vaccine for HPV, for cervical cancer, strain number 18 and number 16.
[01:44:10.594 --> 01:44:20.038]  I just read a new report that came out last week that said that if strain 16 is persistent, you'd have an increased risk of cancer down the road.
[01:44:20.498 --> 01:44:24.160]  Well, more than 90% of people, when they get HPV, it comes and goes.
[01:44:24.983 --> 01:44:28.966]  So when they say is persistent, does that mean more than two years or five years or seven years?
[01:44:29.647 --> 01:44:33.069]  The numbers are such a... And there's also cervical treatments.
[01:44:33.110 --> 01:44:36.552]  I mean, if they find that you have it, they go in and clean it up and that knocks the risk out.
[01:44:36.652 --> 01:44:49.823]  Well, better than that, Alex, it's been my experience in my practice here in Cleveland, Ohio, that if women have positive HPV, and that I really believe, and it's been our experience, that it's a nutritional deficiency disease.
[01:44:50.545 --> 01:45:05.150]  And when we clean up their diets and we get them on high doses of vitamin D, get their vitamin D levels up to 80 by blood test, put them on vitamin A, use some other types of supplements, and in women over the age of 40 use some natural progesterone, it goes away on its own.
[01:45:06.050 --> 01:45:10.292]  And we have almost 100% of the time... Well that's what all the studies show.
[01:45:10.332 --> 01:45:13.093]  These are run down, I'm sorry to say it, but mainly crack whores.
[01:45:13.516 --> 01:45:16.397]  Well, maybe not all of them.
[01:45:16.417 --> 01:45:25.159]  No, I'm saying a large percentage from other medical doctors we've talked to have said cancer survivors, really sick people, or folks living on the street who aren't eating good food.
[01:45:25.339 --> 01:45:32.781]  Yes, and so it goes back to my point of that persistent HPV infections are a nutritional deficiency disease.
[01:45:33.581 --> 01:45:40.343]  And if you clean up your diet and do the right things for your health, that will go away and doesn't become a problem in almost everybody.
[01:45:41.516 --> 01:45:53.742]  So back to what you were saying about pertussis, you know, the numbers of pertussis, I mean, we had that big, I'm sure, you know, you talked about it a lot, I've talked about it when it was all happening in California, that you get a few cases of pertussis and everybody goes into hysteria.
[01:45:54.242 --> 01:46:02.586]  And I think it's really important for your listeners to know that the only age group in which pertussis is really a serious illness is in babies under three months of age.
[01:46:03.486 --> 01:46:07.108]  The vast majority of everyone else has a persistent cough and it goes away in a couple of months.
[01:46:07.492 --> 01:46:12.496]  And so why do parents throw their one-month-old baby in daycare with 50 other kids?
[01:46:13.236 --> 01:46:18.260]  Because I've seen the studies that a lot of times the vaccine doesn't even really protect them fully from the whooping cough.
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:20.702]  Oh, it doesn't protect at all.
[01:46:20.722 --> 01:46:26.366]  In fact, most of the kids that end up with pertussis, or a large percentage of them, have been vaccinated at 2, 4, and 6 months.
[01:46:26.706 --> 01:46:27.347]  So there you go.
[01:46:27.387 --> 01:46:29.488]  They're killing them, and that's the studies I'd seen.
[01:46:29.508 --> 01:46:30.949]  I wanted to make sure with a medical doctor.
[01:46:31.730 --> 01:46:34.612]  I bet if you go actually research these kids, a lot of them were vaccinated.
[01:46:34.957 --> 01:46:37.359]  Yep, and I want to just give you one statistic.
[01:46:37.399 --> 01:46:44.144]  There's lots of them out there, and again, if you went to drtenpennygott.com and clicked on forms, you can download these PDFs and see them for yourself.
[01:46:44.164 --> 01:46:46.747]  In 2007, there were 10,454 reported cases of pertussis nationwide.
[01:46:46.787 --> 01:46:47.767]  Confirmed cases of pertussis.
[01:46:48.088 --> 01:46:48.868]  There were 10 deaths.
[01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:07.848]  If we vaccinated over 10,000 people and had 10 deaths from the vaccine, they would say that was statistically insignificant.
[01:47:08.168 --> 01:47:13.654]  But if we have 10,000 cases of pertussis and 10 deaths, it's a national emergency and they're going to call it an epidemic.
[01:47:15.037 --> 01:47:21.580]  So, they twist these numbers and use them however they can to incite fear, fear, fear in everybody.
[01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:22.100]  That's right.
[01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:35.626]  We have massive death, miscarriages, brain damage, narcolepsy, people developing permanent epilepsy from the vaccines, admitted, just the H1N1 alone, every other major vaccine, same story, or even worse.
[01:47:36.046 --> 01:47:37.067]  We know it's doing it.
[01:47:37.287 --> 01:47:40.629]  And they're like, it's insignificant to have 3,500 miscarriages.
[01:47:40.950 --> 01:47:44.112]  It's insignificant to have tens of thousands developing Guillain-Barre.
[01:47:44.452 --> 01:47:49.696]  It's insignificant to have tens of thousands developing epilepsy from brain inflammation.
[01:47:50.897 --> 01:47:54.919]  But one person dies of pertussis, it's the end of the world.
[01:47:55.260 --> 01:47:59.122]  See you, you anti-vaccine kooks, you all need to go to jail.
[01:47:59.142 --> 01:48:01.524]  That pretty much sums it up.
[01:48:03.045 --> 01:48:03.485]  Amazing.
[01:48:04.916 --> 01:48:07.981]  Now, what about reading the inserts over the years?
[01:48:08.001 --> 01:48:13.349]  I mean, I just know going back five, six years ago, they were saying, if you're a pregnant mother, don't vaccinate.
[01:48:13.589 --> 01:48:15.972]  Now they're saying, oh no, that's the group that really needs it.
[01:48:16.293 --> 01:48:17.014]  How have they done a 180?
[01:48:18.937 --> 01:48:20.138]  You know, it's interesting, Alex.
[01:48:20.218 --> 01:48:23.539]  I was at a vaccine conference in Washington, D.C.
[01:48:24.059 --> 01:48:25.579]  in March of 2004.
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:38.944]  It was the first international neonatal conference, and I remember this like it was a minute ago, because they were talking at that point in time about how were they possibly going to be able to start vaccinating mothers, vaccinating pregnant women,
[01:48:39.464 --> 01:48:49.712]  With the flu shot, because what they were going to have to do was somehow manipulate the data and be able to get the fetus on the vaccine injury compensation table in case there was something that happened.
[01:48:50.152 --> 01:48:57.938]  And there were many people in that audience who were doctors and researchers and representatives from the pharmaceutical industry saying, no, all we have to do is just get it.
[01:48:58.118 --> 01:49:03.242]  And because if it turns out that they have a miscarriage, well, they can't prove it was the vaccine.
[01:49:03.866 --> 01:49:04.226]  That was in 2004.
[01:49:18.951 --> 01:49:19.191]  Thank you.
[01:49:39.528 --> 01:49:42.611]  And somehow we've got the medical industry who's bought into that.
[01:49:42.891 --> 01:49:43.271]  All of them!
[01:49:43.471 --> 01:49:45.433]  Well, of course they have, because they're paid off by it.
[01:49:45.453 --> 01:49:58.723]  The American Medical Association, I mean, even the European Union Commission found that their medical commissions, the British Medical Commission, the Canadian, our medical commissions are literally run by people that also work for the vaccine makers.
[01:49:59.064 --> 01:50:06.850]  Well, that's absolutely true, but Alex, when you think about this, 800,000 physicians in this country, how did they co-opt every single one of their brains?
[01:50:08.545 --> 01:50:15.927]  If they admit that there's evil people running the medical professions on the top, then they'll have to have responsibilities.
[01:50:16.287 --> 01:50:19.628]  And so they get more money, they get little bonuses for the more vaccines they give.
[01:50:19.888 --> 01:50:22.729]  They've got a mistress they've got to visit, they've got a golf game they've got to visit.
[01:50:23.109 --> 01:50:27.231]  And when they give the little baby the shot and it has a convulsion, they just say, I didn't cause that.
[01:50:27.531 --> 01:50:31.872]  They've hurt so many children that they're too weak-minded to admit what they've done.
[01:50:32.452 --> 01:50:36.694]  And so now the bioethics boards say, send the old lady home to die, we're not going to give her surgery.
[01:50:36.934 --> 01:50:42.696]  The doctors go, yeah, after Bill Gates says it's good to kill one old lady for ten jobs for teachers.
[01:50:43.057 --> 01:50:47.699]  See, that's what, I mean, they don't give the Hippocratic Oath anymore, as you know, Doc, so, what, 15 years or so?
[01:50:47.719 --> 01:50:50.860]  So, hey, you know, the new oath is do harm.
[01:50:51.140 --> 01:50:52.701]  Kill granny, kill baby.
[01:50:52.981 --> 01:50:54.141]  Bill Gates, it's for the earth.
[01:50:54.501 --> 01:50:55.842]  We'll be back with some of the documents.
[01:50:56.162 --> 01:50:57.503]  We'll be right back with Dr. Sherry Tinpenny.
[01:50:57.523 --> 01:50:57.863]  Stay with us.
[01:51:01.021 --> 01:51:02.261]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.321 --> 01:51:07.663]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.903 --> 01:51:12.525]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.925 --> 01:51:13.325]  It's true.
[01:51:13.405 --> 01:51:17.947]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:18.487 --> 01:51:23.190]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.711 --> 01:51:25.632]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:51:26.032 --> 01:51:30.635]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.835 --> 01:51:31.736]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:31.956 --> 01:51:34.718]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:35.018 --> 01:51:38.320]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.641 --> 01:51:41.482]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[01:51:52.856 --> 01:51:57.364]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:57.685 --> 01:52:00.089]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:00.987 --> 01:52:04.008]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?

[01:53:06.443 --> 01:53:07.243]  Why Ali-C?
[01:53:07.303 --> 01:53:10.664]  Because it helps your body fight viruses, bacteria, and fungi.
[01:53:10.864 --> 01:53:18.546]  Ali-C has been scientifically proven in double-blind studies using low doses to greatly reduce the number, severity, and duration of common colds.
[01:53:18.926 --> 01:53:24.311]  Ali-C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized allicin, the active ingredient in crushed garlic.
[01:53:24.511 --> 01:53:29.175]  Studies show Ali-C is effective against MRSA, bacterial, fungal, and viral infections.
[01:53:29.715 --> 01:53:33.058]  One tablet of Ali-C has the equivalent of 40 cloves of garlic.

[01:54:05.225 --> 01:54:08.066]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are eastbounding down.
[01:54:08.707 --> 01:54:09.987]  Loaded up and trucking.
[01:54:10.668 --> 01:54:14.150]  Put your foot down on the pedal.
[01:54:14.210 --> 01:54:17.551]  Son, never mind them brakes.
[01:54:17.611 --> 01:54:23.554]  Cause we got a run to make.
[01:54:32.494 --> 01:54:38.499]  Think about what we did.
[01:54:38.559 --> 01:54:41.181]  Record low numbers of people taking the flu shot.
[01:54:41.521 --> 01:54:42.042]  It came out.
[01:54:42.082 --> 01:54:42.782]  It was deadly.
[01:54:43.343 --> 01:54:46.045]  It got suspended all over Europe, all over Asia.
[01:54:46.706 --> 01:54:48.487]  These people are being exposed.
[01:54:48.507 --> 01:54:49.488]  They're getting sued.
[01:54:49.548 --> 01:54:50.929]  They're losing the lawsuits.
[01:54:51.850 --> 01:54:56.013]  I believe that vaccine science, if it was properly done, does hold some promise.
[01:54:56.513 --> 01:55:07.921]  The problem is, I have all the documents from the Rockefeller Foundation in the 20s, saying we'll use vaccines to give people cancer, then we'll own the anti-cancer companies and treatments, we'll make money.
[01:55:08.182 --> 01:55:09.823]  That's up on InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[01:55:10.143 --> 01:55:15.407]  We'll sterilize people through vaccines, but we can't have them noticed, so it'll only sterilize a certain number.
[01:55:16.047 --> 01:55:17.448]  It'll be a week sterilization.
[01:55:17.688 --> 01:55:18.748]  I've got all those documents.
[01:55:18.768 --> 01:55:20.549]  I'm going to show some here in a moment.
[01:55:20.649 --> 01:55:23.291]  But, Sherry Timpani's video is now done.
[01:55:23.811 --> 01:55:24.932]  It's been manufactured.
[01:55:25.352 --> 01:55:26.512]  High production quality.
[01:55:26.933 --> 01:55:28.634]  It is flu and flu vaccines.
[01:55:28.674 --> 01:55:29.794]  What's coming through the needle.
[01:55:30.094 --> 01:55:31.295]  Two DVD set.
[01:55:31.755 --> 01:55:33.096]  You can now order it.
[01:55:33.196 --> 01:55:34.497]  It'll be shipping out in about a week.
[01:55:34.837 --> 01:55:35.857]  You can now order it.
[01:55:35.957 --> 01:55:36.438]  It's done.
[01:55:36.478 --> 01:55:37.498]  It's been mass produced.
[01:55:37.578 --> 01:55:38.679]  We're going to be carrying it.
[01:55:39.219 --> 01:55:40.600]  At InfoWars.com.
[01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:42.962]  In fact, it's going up on the site right now on the shopping cart.
[01:55:43.242 --> 01:55:49.747]  You can order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and show it to your friends, your family, your neighbors.
[01:55:49.967 --> 01:55:55.411]  You can email Dr. Tenpenny and tell them about what access station you want to air it and she'll give you authorization on a case by case.
[01:55:55.891 --> 01:55:58.772]  But again, flu and flu vaccines, what's coming through the needle.
[01:55:58.932 --> 01:56:03.233]  This is the latest up-to-date as a truth weapon to fight these people.
[01:56:03.273 --> 01:56:07.074]  So get it at InfoWars.com and get it out to everyone you know.
[01:56:07.434 --> 01:56:10.034]  Now, Dr. Tim Penning, I know you go off the government's own documents.
[01:56:10.054 --> 01:56:12.535]  You go off their own admissions.
[01:56:13.435 --> 01:56:17.236]  But I want to bring this subject up now at the end of this segment and the short segment coming up.
[01:56:17.276 --> 01:56:20.737]  We'll have you back up very soon and hopefully play some clips of the film here on air.
[01:56:21.857 --> 01:56:23.318]  Let me have a document cam shot, guys.
[01:56:23.618 --> 01:56:29.941]  Rockefeller Foundation and WHO continue collaboration on sterilization vaccines and implantables.
[01:56:30.402 --> 01:56:35.705]  And then it's got links to the Rockefeller and World Health Organization admissions, how they develop these systems.
[01:56:36.005 --> 01:56:36.845]  Here's another article.
[01:56:37.226 --> 01:56:42.548]  Rockefeller Foundation conceptualized anti-hormone vaccine in the 20s and 30s, reports reveal.
[01:56:42.889 --> 01:56:44.870]  Then in 68, they developed it.
[01:56:45.671 --> 01:56:46.734]  We have that report.
[01:56:47.336 --> 01:56:52.833]  Millions of Chinese oppose mass vaccination plan are saying no to the UN trying to vaccinate them in China.
[01:56:54.211 --> 01:56:57.272]  Navy to test its ability to vaccinate masses in a pandemic.
[01:56:58.052 --> 01:56:58.932]  It just goes on and on.
[01:56:58.952 --> 01:57:02.894]  You've got the German government and others refusing to take their own vaccines getting caught.
[01:57:02.934 --> 01:57:05.654]  That's one reason people got upset.
[01:57:05.954 --> 01:57:09.996]  Secretive executive order establishes Big Brother health bureaucracy.
[01:57:10.576 --> 01:57:21.819]  Sherry, I don't know if you've researched the eugenics angle, because I know you just cover what you can absolutely prove, but it's provable that there's a huge agenda to hurt people with the vaccines.
[01:57:23.066 --> 01:57:27.909]  There's no doubt that at some level there absolutely is an agenda.
[01:57:28.389 --> 01:57:31.772]  I always go back, Alex, I always like to use Enron as an example.
[01:57:32.232 --> 01:57:37.155]  You know, you've got those eight people at the top that imploded two major corporations.
[01:57:37.925 --> 01:57:48.274]  And I think that there were a lot of people that worked for Enron that sat around in their cubicles and just did their job and went home to their soccer matches with their families and they had no idea what was going on.
[01:57:48.754 --> 01:57:54.279]  I think the pharmaceutical industry in particular, in general, and the vaccine industry in specific, it's the same thing.
[01:57:54.639 --> 01:58:02.005]  There are people who are plotting and planning and knowing all of these things, but the public health nurse down at the lowest rung just thinks
[01:58:02.005 --> 01:58:03.147]  I think she's doing a good job.
[01:58:03.187 --> 01:58:14.803]  And that's why we've got to get your new two DVD film from a medical perspective with all the proof that's come out about this stuff being deadly and we've got to get it to nurses and doctors now because they're compartmentalized.
[01:58:14.923 --> 01:58:15.804]  Yep, exactly.
[01:58:16.530 --> 01:58:17.310]  You're absolutely right.
[01:58:17.370 --> 01:58:18.431]  I'll help you any way I can.
[01:58:18.731 --> 01:58:24.794]  Well, we're very excited that we're now carrying the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:58:25.094 --> 01:58:27.035]  Flu and vaccine, what's coming through the needle.
[01:58:27.415 --> 01:58:31.477]  From a medical perspective, all documented, this has got to be gotten out to everyone.
[01:58:31.837 --> 01:58:32.557]  Sherry, stay there.
[01:58:32.577 --> 01:58:35.018]  I want to do five more minutes with you on this key subject.
[01:58:35.819 --> 01:58:38.020]  And then we've got Bob Chapman coming up on the economy.
[01:58:38.060 --> 01:58:38.480]  Stay with us.
[01:58:44.284 --> 01:58:48.547]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:50.228 --> 01:58:52.969]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[01:58:53.369 --> 01:58:56.892]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[01:58:57.152 --> 01:58:59.793]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[01:59:00.033 --> 01:59:05.056]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[01:59:05.417 --> 01:59:10.980]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.
[01:59:11.340 --> 01:59:13.361]  It's all fresh, made on a monthly basis.
[01:59:13.681 --> 01:59:16.683]  Not some old cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[01:59:17.023 --> 01:59:21.285]  Try their new Evacuation Pack, a two-week supply of delicious, easy-to-fix food.
[01:59:21.545 --> 01:59:29.669]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it, with open talk of a strike on Iran in the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.
[01:59:30.049 --> 01:59:31.830]  Get yourself and your family ready today.
[01:59:32.250 --> 01:59:34.290]  The place to go is efoodsdirect.com.

[01:59:42.452 --> 01:59:49.814]  Again, on the web, efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex, or give them a call at 800-409-5633.
[01:59:53.415 --> 01:59:55.355]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.775 --> 01:59:58.556]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.345 --> 02:00:09.527]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.187 --> 02:00:10.987]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.767 --> 02:00:12.668]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.328 --> 02:00:16.969]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.509 --> 02:00:21.551]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.527 --> 02:00:31.930]  Final segment with Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, her new documentary, Just Out Flu and Flu Vaccines, what's coming to the Needle, two DVD set.
[02:00:32.550 --> 02:00:39.833]  It is a life and death situation to get this out to medical workers, to nurses, to doctors.
[02:00:39.893 --> 02:00:45.095]  Sherry, in closing, I think the biggest issue here is they've been exposed to be involved in fraud.
[02:00:45.415 --> 02:00:47.236]  They know these vaccines are hurting people.
[02:00:47.536 --> 02:00:51.778]  We know the cost-benefit analysis, there's a lot more cost than supposed benefit.
[02:00:53.078 --> 02:00:59.445]  And now they tried in Massachusetts and New York to forcibly inoculate medical workers, police and others.
[02:01:00.005 --> 02:01:02.628]  They rebelled and said no, but many got intimidated into it.
[02:01:02.988 --> 02:01:12.118]  Now they're back, you said earlier, covertly over 50 major medical institutions that own huge chains of hospitals saying, you've got to take this if you work here.
[02:01:12.858 --> 02:01:14.640]  That is so dangerous.
[02:01:14.660 --> 02:01:15.841]  So from what you're saying,
[02:01:16.562 --> 02:01:26.173]  They are implementing forced vaccination through stealth, and if they can make the medical workers submit, they're going to be primed to make us submit to forced inoculation.
[02:01:26.193 --> 02:01:27.575]  So we've got to stand behind them.
[02:01:28.444 --> 02:01:29.665]  That sums it up, Alex.
[02:01:29.765 --> 02:01:34.790]  And I've said for years is that all of the vaccine industry is the backbone of the pharmaceutical industry.
[02:01:35.190 --> 02:01:51.804]  If we can inject all of these kids with now what amounts to 40 doses of 16 different vaccines, 40 doses of 16 different vaccines by the time they start kindergarten and get them sick with asthma, allergies, headaches, and on and on, we can now make them customers for life.
[02:01:52.725 --> 02:01:54.487]  And if we pull the vaccine industry out,
[02:01:55.051 --> 02:01:56.231]  By at least 50%.
[02:01:56.311 --> 02:01:57.532]  If not 100%, at least 50%.
[02:01:58.612 --> 02:02:02.913]  We would drop the incidence of illness and the cost of healthcare in this country like a rock.
[02:02:02.993 --> 02:02:06.174]  And that's what mountains of admitted documentation shows.
[02:02:06.214 --> 02:02:13.356]  You've got it all on your website from the government's own research worldwide, different governments and institutions, but we saw it last year.
[02:02:13.616 --> 02:02:17.217]  Record low numbers of seasonal NH1N1 globally.
[02:02:17.257 --> 02:02:18.138]  People refused.
[02:02:18.558 --> 02:02:19.978]  Record low flu season.
[02:02:20.318 --> 02:02:21.439]  Record low deaths.
[02:02:21.699 --> 02:02:22.159]  How many
[02:02:22.699 --> 02:02:26.460]  How many of you know somebody or you took the flu shot and almost killed your butt?
[02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:28.461]  I mean, but that's anecdotal!
[02:02:28.581 --> 02:02:29.921]  We have the statistics!
[02:02:30.021 --> 02:02:30.661]  We know!
[02:02:30.681 --> 02:02:36.023]  I'm speechless, Sherry.
[02:02:36.223 --> 02:02:38.924]  Closing comments or any other issues you haven't covered.
[02:02:39.659 --> 02:02:42.761]  No, I think that the most important thing is to get the DVD.
[02:02:42.821 --> 02:02:47.123]  Get it from InfoWars, get it from us, get it out there to all of your friends and family.
[02:02:47.563 --> 02:02:50.125]  It is one of the most important works that I think I've ever done.
[02:02:50.145 --> 02:02:56.288]  And it took me 120 hours of research just to put the DVD together.
[02:02:56.328 --> 02:02:59.249]  It took me 120 hours to put the DVD and the material together.
[02:02:59.630 --> 02:03:03.612]  It took me thousands of hours to research it, to put it all, to get all the information.
[02:03:03.632 --> 02:03:05.173]  And I'm glad we did this because
[02:03:06.073 --> 02:03:14.735]  What, six, eight months ago or more, I sent Rob Dew and others to interview you for my Eugenics film, and this film I've been working on for two years.
[02:03:14.815 --> 02:03:19.116]  It's not going to be out until next year now, but it's the masterwork on everything.
[02:03:19.156 --> 02:03:21.297]  It's like an encyclopedia of their crimes.
[02:03:21.337 --> 02:03:26.518]  So I'm glad to hear that you were telling me during the break because we screwed around and didn't get it out.
[02:03:26.858 --> 02:03:29.719]  You've gone out and gotten one out, and it looks extremely powerful.
[02:03:30.099 --> 02:03:32.920]  I mean, it's up to the listeners, though, to get this out to everybody.
[02:03:33.420 --> 02:03:34.421]  It really is.
[02:03:34.621 --> 02:03:36.001]  And it's everything you want to know.
[02:03:36.041 --> 02:03:42.664]  From manufacturing, to what's in the needle, to all of the statistics that Alex and I have spoken about over the last hour.
[02:03:43.065 --> 02:03:44.345]  It's all there.
[02:03:44.565 --> 02:03:45.966]  All you need to do is just spread the word.
[02:03:47.093 --> 02:03:50.055]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, we're awake now.
[02:03:50.115 --> 02:03:53.317]  We're there reporting on the deaths and the epilepsy.
[02:03:53.938 --> 02:03:54.578]  One minute left.
[02:03:55.018 --> 02:03:57.080]  England has suspended the shot in under fives.
[02:03:57.100 --> 02:04:02.243]  They admit the government a tenfold increase in violent convulsions in healthy children.
[02:04:02.804 --> 02:04:04.365]  That's a big thing to have them admit that.
[02:04:04.901 --> 02:04:08.263]  It is a big thing, but keep in mind, Alex, that was just one flu shot.
[02:04:08.323 --> 02:04:09.324]  That's Afluria.
[02:04:09.584 --> 02:04:12.145]  There are eight different manufactured brands out there.
[02:04:12.205 --> 02:04:14.807]  They just suspended it in just one flu shot.
[02:04:14.847 --> 02:04:20.270]  They didn't suspend it in all children, for all flu shots, just children under the age of five for Afluria.
[02:04:21.230 --> 02:04:23.252]  So that brings back to the point.
[02:04:23.312 --> 02:04:25.533]  There are eight different manufactured flu shots.
[02:04:25.553 --> 02:04:29.315]  They all have different side effect profiles, and they all have different ingredients.
[02:04:29.655 --> 02:04:32.237]  You must not let this stuff be injected into your body.
[02:04:33.123 --> 02:04:37.024]  And I had the head of the British Medical Journal on, and she said, yes, it's all a fraud.
[02:04:37.384 --> 02:04:47.406]  I mean, this is amazing how far we've come, and they're really getting desperate now, trying to use this pertussis thing in California to hype forced inoculation.
[02:04:47.846 --> 02:04:48.887]  Doc, God bless you.
[02:04:49.307 --> 02:04:50.547]  We'll talk to you again very soon.
[02:04:50.567 --> 02:04:51.707]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:04:51.827 --> 02:04:52.807]  You have a great afternoon.
[02:04:52.887 --> 02:04:53.167]  You bet.
[02:04:53.188 --> 02:04:53.628]  You too.
[02:04:53.668 --> 02:04:54.908]  I'll call you after the show.
[02:04:55.568 --> 02:04:57.008]  There goes Dr. Sherry Tinpenny.
[02:04:57.028 --> 02:04:58.929]  Bob Chapman is coming up on the economy.
[02:04:58.949 --> 02:04:59.429]  Stay with us.
[02:05:04.483 --> 02:05:05.403]  Tyranny is here.
[02:05:05.743 --> 02:05:09.264]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:05:09.605 --> 02:05:11.885]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:05:11.905 --> 02:05:17.347]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:05:17.767 --> 02:05:24.009]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:05:24.429 --> 02:05:29.973]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:05:30.413 --> 02:05:34.095]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:05:34.596 --> 02:05:38.578]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:05:38.878 --> 02:05:44.382]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:05:44.822 --> 02:05:47.764]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:05:48.384 --> 02:05:49.805]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:05:50.365 --> 02:05:50.786]  It's here.

[02:06:01.052 --> 02:06:15.522]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:06:16.542 --> 02:06:20.205]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:21.212 --> 02:06:33.224]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:06:33.984 --> 02:06:41.251]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:06:41.932 --> 02:06:51.544]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.

[02:08:01.277 --> 02:08:06.346]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[02:08:35.102 --> 02:08:36.422]  I am very excited.
[02:08:36.442 --> 02:08:38.423]  We're routing the global government.
[02:08:38.443 --> 02:08:39.764]  We're exposing the bankers.
[02:08:40.124 --> 02:08:42.285]  We're exposing their eugenics operation.
[02:08:42.906 --> 02:08:45.367]  We're having devastating effect on the enemy.
[02:08:45.967 --> 02:08:53.211]  And when we, the people, turn loose the power that is innate in our species, with God's help, we can route out this evil.
[02:08:53.251 --> 02:08:59.375]  But we have to start respecting ourselves, believing that we can have an effect, and taking the field of intellectual battle.
[02:08:59.995 --> 02:09:05.401]  And we've got to pray to our Heavenly Father to lead, guide, and direct us.
[02:09:06.362 --> 02:09:11.066]  Now, I've got a lot of incredible financial news here.
[02:09:11.887 --> 02:09:18.213]  Obviously, you don't need me to tell you that gold has hit three times this week, broken its all-time record.
[02:09:19.306 --> 02:09:22.569]  Or that they admit that Americans are more poor now than we've ever been in our history.
[02:09:22.869 --> 02:09:26.171]  We're in a higher rate of debt than we were during the depths of the Great Depression.
[02:09:26.191 --> 02:09:31.055]  We're going to be walking through all of this with Bob Chapman today.
[02:09:31.595 --> 02:09:39.682]  But first, I wanted to get Bob Chapman's take on Pennsylvania Homeland Security-employed Israeli company to suppress American political speech.
[02:09:40.262 --> 02:09:45.690]  And they use this company to track and get people and have their rights suppressed and arrested at the G20.
[02:09:46.512 --> 02:09:48.855]  Is this not espionage and high treason?
[02:09:48.975 --> 02:09:50.438]  Espionage on the end of Israel.
[02:09:50.958 --> 02:09:54.263]  High treason by this state and by the federal government.
[02:09:55.202 --> 02:09:56.042]  to be doing this.
[02:09:56.523 --> 02:09:58.464]  We know this has been going on for a long time.
[02:09:58.504 --> 02:10:05.628]  In NLE09, FEMA admitted they were working with troops from 14 nations to practice waging war against the American people.
[02:10:06.388 --> 02:10:10.590]  But it just even shocks me, Bob, how bad it's gotten.
[02:10:10.610 --> 02:10:11.411]  It's like termites.
[02:10:12.031 --> 02:10:22.279]  When you move some boxes in your warehouse and they're full of termites, or when you are putting in new sheetrock and find out there's termites behind the wall, or cockroaches.
[02:10:22.759 --> 02:10:25.621]  I mean, you've been talking about this for a long time, Bob.
[02:10:25.641 --> 02:10:27.923]  Well, that's right.
[02:10:28.043 --> 02:10:37.570]  And you know, they've been controlling the telephone conversations for years and years.
[02:10:38.690 --> 02:10:42.176]  And the same Israeli company goes back into the late 1970s.
[02:10:43.118 --> 02:10:51.271]  And the reason I know that is that they accessed my phone one time and called me at 3 o'clock in the morning and they told me they were going to kill me.
[02:10:52.567 --> 02:10:54.348]  I said, come on right over, would you please?
[02:10:54.809 --> 02:10:55.950]  And we haven't had the access in a long time.
[02:10:55.970 --> 02:11:00.112]  So you think that was Israelis that happened, that's happened many times, but I was at Bilderberg 2008.
[02:11:01.293 --> 02:11:01.874]  It was over.
[02:11:02.674 --> 02:11:06.277]  I took the guys to a local hamburger slash steakhouse.
[02:11:06.797 --> 02:11:10.640]  I called my wife, had a private conversation about one of her parents, who was sick.
[02:11:11.610 --> 02:11:18.273]  I hung the phone up and then someone called her with no number on caller ID and said that I'd gotten her pregnant.
[02:11:18.673 --> 02:11:20.093]  My wife said, that's impossible.
[02:11:20.374 --> 02:11:21.954]  And she said, that's right, you bleeper.
[02:11:22.514 --> 02:11:28.817]  And, uh, you know, we're basically going to get you and, and, and, you know, and, and then told her some private things that have been said over the phone.
[02:11:29.617 --> 02:11:31.378]  Uh, and I mean, it's just amazing.
[02:11:32.638 --> 02:11:34.159]  Well, it's been going on for a long time.
[02:11:34.199 --> 02:11:41.242]  In fact, how I know it was the Israelis is the caller was Mordecai Levy, who is now deceased.
[02:11:42.521 --> 02:11:49.507]  And I think he took a swan dive when he was in jail for the third level, but he probably had some help.
[02:11:50.227 --> 02:11:54.831]  But the point is, there's no question, that's who it was.
[02:11:56.292 --> 02:12:08.861]  And so this goes back a long way, and I think if you look at the investigations that they had in San Francisco, oh, probably 20, 25 years ago, with the ADL and their antics.
[02:12:09.201 --> 02:12:09.742]  It was 1990 through 96.
[02:12:12.199 --> 02:12:13.279]  What was it?
[02:12:13.539 --> 02:12:13.739]  1990 through 96.
[02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:15.740]  That's right.
[02:12:16.780 --> 02:12:19.320]  And who was that guy named Ray Roy?
[02:12:20.861 --> 02:12:21.481]  I've got his name.
[02:12:21.541 --> 02:12:22.221]  Hold on, hold on.
[02:12:22.261 --> 02:12:23.641]  I'll pull his name up right here.
[02:12:23.661 --> 02:12:31.143]  His name was Roy Bullock and Tom Gerrard.
[02:12:31.163 --> 02:12:32.163]  You've got a good memory there, Bob.
[02:12:33.864 --> 02:12:35.244]  Yeah, they were involved in it.
[02:12:36.204 --> 02:12:37.444]  And they were spies.
[02:12:37.644 --> 02:12:40.525]  Oh wait, you're saying you were harassed by these guys?
[02:12:41.681 --> 02:12:42.301]  That's right.
[02:12:42.762 --> 02:12:43.962]  Wow, because you lived out there.
[02:12:44.142 --> 02:12:53.687]  They were after me for years, and I never even really ever talked about, in those days, Zionism or anything Jewish or anything else.
[02:12:53.727 --> 02:12:55.147]  No, no, no, that's in the news!
[02:12:55.427 --> 02:12:56.948]  They felt like it.
[02:12:57.048 --> 02:13:00.270]  Listen, it's anti-war groups, it's tea parties, it's liberals.
[02:13:01.130 --> 02:13:02.691]  Basically, they've been hired by the U.S.
[02:13:02.731 --> 02:13:06.893]  government just to go after anybody who talks to their neighbor.
[02:13:06.973 --> 02:13:09.054]  I mean, it's like you're not allowed to have speech in America.
[02:13:11.124 --> 02:13:14.585]  Well, they came to my house the following day and sat across the street.
[02:13:15.385 --> 02:13:19.186]  So my son and I went over to visit them with our ARs.
[02:13:20.027 --> 02:13:21.807]  And they left and they never came back.
[02:13:23.048 --> 02:13:24.808]  Now, is that your son that was the police chief?
[02:13:26.208 --> 02:13:27.189]  No, no.
[02:13:28.109 --> 02:13:30.050]  My nephew is the system police chief.
[02:13:30.070 --> 02:13:30.570]  Oh, that's right.
[02:13:30.790 --> 02:13:34.151]  My son, he's not in that line of work.
[02:13:34.171 --> 02:13:35.631]  I know it was some of your family out there.
[02:13:36.231 --> 02:13:37.792]  My son was 12 at the time.
[02:13:39.355 --> 02:13:41.535]  Now he's 42, so it was 30 years ago.
[02:13:41.555 --> 02:13:46.176]  I mean, these people have harassed me since 1967.
[02:13:49.097 --> 02:13:58.479]  But that's the issue, is that it's so brazen and now it's the ADL that openly trains the police departments, along with the Southern Poverty Law Center and others.
[02:13:59.839 --> 02:14:00.460]  Well, that's true.
[02:14:02.500 --> 02:14:05.161]  I mean, at least in the 1990s they went to jail for this stuff.
[02:14:05.501 --> 02:14:07.041]  Now these groups don't get in any trouble.
[02:14:08.476 --> 02:14:27.155]  Well the question is, and you brought it up at the beginning of the conversation, fundamentally how can we as a nation allow foreign countries' agencies to come in and do things that American companies are capable of?
[02:14:32.236 --> 02:14:32.696]  Oh boy.
[02:14:32.716 --> 02:14:35.177]  Alright, well we got through that subject.
[02:14:35.218 --> 02:14:37.138]  I covered it extensively in the first hour.
[02:14:38.159 --> 02:14:38.939]  I'm just sick of it.
[02:14:38.959 --> 02:14:39.900]  I just want to live in peace.
[02:14:39.960 --> 02:14:42.221]  I don't want to have 60% tax rates.
[02:14:42.941 --> 02:14:44.362]  I don't want these illegal wars.
[02:14:44.422 --> 02:14:46.043]  I don't want to go through naked body scanners.
[02:14:46.083 --> 02:14:46.803]  I'm sick of it.
[02:14:47.203 --> 02:14:47.984]  I'm sick of it.
[02:14:48.384 --> 02:14:52.546]  And I'm not a terrorist, but I think these groups and the federal government and
[02:14:53.346 --> 02:14:53.706]  That's right.
[02:14:53.746 --> 02:14:56.748]  And I don't think they've ever had anybody say the things to them that I did.
[02:14:56.768 --> 02:14:58.028]  And I'm glad I said them.
[02:14:58.048 --> 02:15:00.629]  Actually, the first conversation, my wife told them that.
[02:15:25.319 --> 02:15:27.100]  Yeah, she just said, look, you want to come on?
[02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:27.720]  You want to die?
[02:15:27.780 --> 02:15:28.400]  Come on over.
[02:15:29.320 --> 02:15:30.561]  We can arrange anything here.
[02:15:32.822 --> 02:15:39.524]  Well, I lived in Malibu for 20 years, and at that time I was living there and we had everything scoped out.
[02:15:40.509 --> 02:15:43.270]  Well, I don't know who's calling us death-threatening us.
[02:15:43.430 --> 02:15:45.970]  I just know they're already listening to our phones.
[02:15:46.290 --> 02:15:49.331]  They like to let us know what our dog's doing in the backyard.
[02:15:49.611 --> 02:15:51.851]  They like to let my wife know we were just talking about.
[02:15:52.111 --> 02:15:58.113]  So whoever it is taps my phones, then a few times a year just calls up and says, I'll cut your head off.
[02:15:58.653 --> 02:16:00.033]  I'll rape you.
[02:16:00.673 --> 02:16:02.833]  Your little dog was just out back drinking water.
[02:16:02.873 --> 02:16:03.914]  I'd like to kill it.
[02:16:04.654 --> 02:16:05.394]  Really nice people.
[02:16:07.250 --> 02:16:08.871]  Well, that's psychological warfare.
[02:16:09.051 --> 02:16:20.801]  And because of the sacrifices that you've made for the American people, you're going to have to put up with it and be strong and don't let it get to you and keep on doing the fantastic work that you're doing.
[02:16:21.241 --> 02:16:24.244]  And we are kicking them all over the place.
[02:16:24.704 --> 02:16:25.545]  We're killing them.
[02:16:26.065 --> 02:16:31.530]  Incidentally, I was on Wednesday again in Athens and I gave them an earful again.
[02:16:31.550 --> 02:16:33.772]  And I don't know if you saw the
[02:16:35.590 --> 02:16:42.595]  The article in Vanity Fair by Mike Lewis, who's an author.
[02:16:44.676 --> 02:16:52.261]  Anyway, he mentioned the fact that he went up to see these monks who were very active in politics in Greece.
[02:16:52.841 --> 02:16:55.003]  And he said, well, how do you know so much about all this stuff?
[02:16:55.403 --> 02:16:59.506]  And they said, well, Bob Chapman at the International Forecaster is our advisor.
[02:17:02.093 --> 02:17:08.735]  No, I did see that with the Orthodox Church plugging you, so you're certainly having an effect, Bob.
[02:17:10.016 --> 02:17:14.457]  Well, I love it, and I'm safely tucked away.
[02:17:14.477 --> 02:17:16.978]  They have a heck of a time trying to find me.
[02:17:17.958 --> 02:17:22.100]  And we're going to keep on doing it, and we're going to win.
[02:17:22.580 --> 02:17:25.801]  And so all you people out there, we are going to win.
[02:17:26.385 --> 02:17:27.386]  You just gotta help us.
[02:17:27.787 --> 02:17:28.808]  You gotta do your part.
[02:17:29.429 --> 02:17:34.796]  Listen to what Alex says, because he's closer to the heartbeat of what's going on than I am.
[02:17:35.397 --> 02:17:42.747]  And go forward, get those DVDs out, and let the whole world know who's taking advantage of them.
[02:17:44.195 --> 02:17:45.676]  Bob, let's get into the economy.
[02:17:45.696 --> 02:17:47.017]  I was looking around for my stack.
[02:17:47.057 --> 02:17:48.418]  I covered it in the first hour.
[02:17:48.938 --> 02:17:57.803]  Then I got into geoengineering and sterilization vaccines and everything else, but I have this huge stack where, oh, here it is.
[02:17:57.843 --> 02:17:58.704]  I found the stack.
[02:17:59.264 --> 02:18:02.946]  Gold rises to record on increased demand for wealth protection.
[02:18:02.966 --> 02:18:04.847]  What we've always said, you can't trust these derivatives.
[02:18:05.228 --> 02:18:06.809]  You can't trust all this paper money.
[02:18:07.849 --> 02:18:10.351]  Silver hits all-time high along with gold.
[02:18:10.991 --> 02:18:11.732]  I gotta go back
[02:18:12.572 --> 02:18:17.774]  Two months ago, when it was at its new low in the last year, you said, I look for September.
[02:18:17.874 --> 02:18:18.955]  I look for it to run up.
[02:18:19.335 --> 02:18:28.819]  And then Bloomberg reported about two weeks ago that the majority of future options on gold in New York and Chicago are at $1,500 by the middle of December.
[02:18:29.519 --> 02:18:31.520]  So you've been absolutely right again, Bob.
[02:18:31.540 --> 02:18:32.740]  So tell us what's coming up with gold.
[02:18:33.941 --> 02:18:35.181]  Well, first of all, thank you.
[02:18:35.581 --> 02:18:36.682]  Gold is up $262.
[02:18:36.942 --> 02:18:39.263]  It's still trading in the October month.
[02:18:39.835 --> 02:18:44.998]  And silver's up three pennies today, which is good considering the gains that it's made recently.
[02:18:46.339 --> 02:19:07.551]  One of my deep, deep people who get me information told me today that the lawsuit, the class action lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase and the silver scam is continuing to go forward.
[02:19:09.169 --> 02:19:10.450]  They haven't announced it yet.
[02:19:10.790 --> 02:19:12.271]  When they will, I don't know.
[02:19:12.892 --> 02:19:14.974]  But I got that from the horse's mouth.
[02:19:15.434 --> 02:19:19.217]  So it hasn't gone away, unless they change their mind.
[02:19:20.018 --> 02:19:22.520]  And they've got input from people who were involved.
[02:19:23.200 --> 02:19:28.745]  And so, you know, as far as evidence is concerned, they've got plenty of it.
[02:19:30.066 --> 02:19:37.092]  One of the things that happened yesterday, I guess it was yesterday, they had the auction
[02:19:38.081 --> 02:19:41.502]  And the foreigners bought a little bit more treasuries than they had before.
[02:19:42.322 --> 02:19:53.946]  But something that people have overlooked is that, and this is a big development, and that is central banks sold $57 billion worth of U.S.
[02:19:54.126 --> 02:19:54.906]  agency debt.
[02:19:55.046 --> 02:19:55.687]  Bob, stay there.
[02:19:55.727 --> 02:19:56.347]  We got a break.
[02:19:56.387 --> 02:19:56.867]  Sorry to interrupt.
[02:19:56.887 --> 02:19:59.288]  We're going to come right back with that on the other side and get more into the economy.
[02:19:59.308 --> 02:19:59.668]  Stay with us.
[02:20:01.187 --> 02:20:04.009]  Off-the-grid remedies can still be grown in your own backyard.
[02:20:04.189 --> 02:20:11.795]  Tap into powerful off-the-grid healthcare using all-natural, time-tested herbal medications that you grow yourself with the new Survival Herb Bank.

[02:20:17.560 --> 02:20:24.945]  Traditional herbal remedies have been used effectively for centuries, but the big pharmaceutical and big government cartel can't patent their natural healing powers.
[02:20:25.065 --> 02:20:26.827]  That's why they are trying to ban them!

[02:21:00.854 --> 02:21:03.576]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[02:21:03.816 --> 02:21:07.778]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[02:21:07.978 --> 02:21:10.039]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[02:21:10.239 --> 02:21:15.262]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[02:21:15.402 --> 02:21:17.163]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[02:21:17.223 --> 02:21:18.564]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[02:21:18.764 --> 02:21:20.225]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[02:21:20.245 --> 02:21:23.307]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[02:21:23.607 --> 02:21:28.652]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[02:21:28.992 --> 02:21:38.121]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[02:21:38.341 --> 02:21:40.643]  The book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[02:21:40.683 --> 02:21:42.285]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.
[02:21:46.749 --> 02:21:46.989]  We're good.
[02:22:00.373 --> 02:22:05.237]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:22:05.337 --> 02:22:06.117]  What have we got?
[02:22:06.337 --> 02:22:08.479]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:22:08.779 --> 02:22:09.520]  A republic.
[02:22:09.780 --> 02:22:12.362]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:22:12.442 --> 02:22:14.343]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:22:14.704 --> 02:22:16.605]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:22:16.725 --> 02:22:18.006]  So they think they own our land?
[02:22:18.406 --> 02:22:19.527]  They think they own our water?
[02:22:19.727 --> 02:22:20.128]  Children?
[02:22:20.328 --> 02:22:21.128]  Our education?
[02:22:21.469 --> 02:22:22.089]  Our money?
[02:22:22.289 --> 02:22:25.932]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:22:26.292 --> 02:22:30.956]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:22:31.256 --> 02:22:32.097]  We have the facts.
[02:22:32.297 --> 02:22:33.418]  We have the Constitution.
[02:22:33.458 --> 02:22:34.338]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:22:34.358 --> 02:22:35.199]  We have common law.
[02:22:35.239 --> 02:22:37.501]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:37.781 --> 02:22:41.544]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:22:41.664 --> 02:22:46.450]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:22:46.610 --> 02:22:48.012]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:22:48.112 --> 02:22:48.953]  Don't tread on me.
[02:22:49.193 --> 02:22:56.061]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:23:00.560 --> 02:23:03.741]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:23:04.121 --> 02:23:05.941]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:23:06.402 --> 02:23:06.822]  Don't!
[02:23:07.262 --> 02:23:10.283]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[02:23:10.703 --> 02:23:17.824]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[02:23:17.804 --> 02:23:19.465]  's number one debt secret.
[02:23:19.785 --> 02:23:23.446]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[02:23:23.866 --> 02:23:26.589]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[02:23:27.010 --> 02:23:34.038]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[02:23:34.378 --> 02:23:35.359]  Herb K was right.
[02:23:35.559 --> 02:23:38.603]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[02:23:38.763 --> 02:23:39.644]  What do you have to lose?
[02:23:40.024 --> 02:23:40.984]  Stop the calls now.
[02:23:41.244 --> 02:23:42.965]  Get out of debt and have more money.
[02:23:43.206 --> 02:23:43.786]  Get Herb K.'

[02:23:46.848 --> 02:23:47.428]  That's 800-405-7850.
[02:23:47.448 --> 02:23:47.488]  800-405-7850.
[02:24:07.603 --> 02:24:11.525]  It's Friday, September 17th, 2010.
[02:24:12.066 --> 02:24:14.967]  Bob Chapman with his once-a-week Friday visit is our guest.
[02:24:14.987 --> 02:24:16.968]  We'll be talking more about the economy.
[02:24:17.068 --> 02:24:23.792]  We're going to open the phones up specifically for first-time callers with questions, economic questions, for Bob Chapman.
[02:24:23.812 --> 02:24:23.832]  1-800
[02:24:25.896 --> 02:24:26.036]  2-5-9-92-31.
[02:24:26.056 --> 02:24:27.878]  1-800-259-9231 will get you up and on the air.
[02:24:27.918 --> 02:24:29.360]  Here's some of the headlines I've got.
[02:24:29.440 --> 02:24:31.342]  This is out of the French News Agency.
[02:24:31.382 --> 02:24:33.504]  Wall Street Casino Spooks Small American Investors.
[02:24:44.861 --> 02:24:47.583]  And people just don't trust it anymore.
[02:24:47.944 --> 02:24:49.205]  They know it's a rigged game.
[02:24:49.725 --> 02:24:50.305]  Here's another one.
[02:24:50.586 --> 02:24:52.687]  Lost decade for family income.
[02:24:52.747 --> 02:24:54.449]  NAFTA and GAP destroyed the economy.
[02:24:54.909 --> 02:24:57.391]  Record number of Americans living in poverty.
[02:24:57.611 --> 02:24:57.951]  43.6 million.
[02:24:58.232 --> 02:24:59.493]  That's with cooked government numbers.
[02:24:59.513 --> 02:25:00.573]  There's a lot of working poor.
[02:25:01.154 --> 02:25:01.374]  U.S.
[02:25:01.414 --> 02:25:03.175]  workers' poverty reaches 50-year high.
[02:25:03.195 --> 02:25:04.036]  But I looked at those numbers.
[02:25:04.096 --> 02:25:04.737]  It's even higher.
[02:25:05.477 --> 02:25:08.179]  Gold and silver hit new highs for second time in one week.
[02:25:08.620 --> 02:25:11.442]  Gold rises to record on increased demand for wealth protection.
[02:25:11.802 --> 02:25:13.864]  Bob, you were finishing up a point as we went to break.
[02:25:15.089 --> 02:25:15.329]  Right.
[02:25:16.289 --> 02:25:21.450]  And yes, we did have some purchases of Treasury securities in the last auction.
[02:25:22.211 --> 02:25:29.092]  But the significant thing is that we had $57 billion worth of U.S.
[02:25:29.252 --> 02:25:36.234]  agency debt, that's Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, and FHA, that was sold.
[02:25:37.314 --> 02:25:42.155]  And that means to me that foreign central banks are getting serious
[02:25:42.742 --> 02:25:46.505]  About diversifying their reserves away from the new U.S.
[02:25:46.565 --> 02:25:46.925]  dollar.
[02:25:47.085 --> 02:25:50.107]  Bob, that's $57 billion.
[02:25:51.208 --> 02:25:53.570]  That's Dr. Evil level stuff.
[02:25:53.850 --> 02:25:56.392]  We've had tens of trillions stolen by the central banks.
[02:25:56.732 --> 02:25:58.853]  China has devalued U.S.
[02:25:58.913 --> 02:26:00.715]  investments, saying they're not AAA.
[02:26:00.955 --> 02:26:07.960]  So you're saying you're really starting to see the exodus out of our entire economic system?
[02:26:09.492 --> 02:26:10.534]  Yeah, that's correct.
[02:26:10.554 --> 02:26:19.025]  And it began about 17 months ago when 64.5% of foreign reserves of foreign countries were in dollars.
[02:26:19.526 --> 02:26:21.569]  Now that figure is 59.5%.
[02:26:22.270 --> 02:26:24.553]  But this is just more proof that it's ongoing.
[02:26:27.472 --> 02:26:30.774]  Bob, what specifically, what do you expect gold to do?
[02:26:30.794 --> 02:26:32.574]  Because you've been predicting this steadily.
[02:26:32.955 --> 02:26:34.055]  What's the main reason?
[02:26:34.095 --> 02:26:36.176]  I mean, I guess AP and Bloomberg get it right.
[02:26:36.416 --> 02:26:42.199]  People are fleeing to gold and silver as a safe haven against fiat currencies and derivatives instruments.
[02:26:44.080 --> 02:26:47.681]  Yes, and that has been going on for the last 10 years in a small way.
[02:26:48.622 --> 02:26:51.503]  Now there's more people coming into the market to do that.
[02:26:52.203 --> 02:26:55.665]  They've been fleeing to treasuries as well as commodities and gold and silver.
[02:26:57.064 --> 02:27:04.587]  I think tomorrow will be a decent day, maybe even to plus $5, and the same on Monday and Tuesday.
[02:27:05.087 --> 02:27:23.173]  Wednesday and Thursday should be weaker because, well, at least Thursday and Friday next week, because on Monday the following week we have option exploration on gold and silver contracts, and so they try to push the price down every time that comes around.
[02:27:23.193 --> 02:27:24.733]  How much do you think it will go down?
[02:27:24.753 --> 02:27:26.074]  How much do you think it will go down next week?
[02:27:27.014 --> 02:27:30.057]  Oh, maybe $5 or $10, $15 at worst.
[02:27:30.257 --> 02:27:34.040]  And then what, in a week or two, race back up to pass the last high?
[02:27:35.061 --> 02:27:37.663]  It's gonna go right through $1,300 like it wasn't there.
[02:27:38.224 --> 02:27:43.288]  Oh, you're... And silver's gonna break out over $21,000 and run to $23,400 or $24,500.
[02:27:44.389 --> 02:27:48.653]  So, you're predicting when will it go to $23,400 or $24,500 in silver?
[02:27:49.013 --> 02:27:51.075]  When will it break $1,300 on gold?
[02:27:52.516 --> 02:27:53.557]  Over the next three weeks.
[02:27:54.923 --> 02:27:57.144]  Well, you heard it from Bob Chapman within three weeks.
[02:27:58.505 --> 02:28:01.086]  Are you saying it's a certainty or like 90% chance?
[02:28:02.587 --> 02:28:13.093]  Well, nothing is ever certain in this life anymore, but unless something untoward happens, we got a great chance of it going through 1300 during that time frame.
[02:28:14.614 --> 02:28:20.377]  There's giant net short positions and they're all naked on the comics.
[02:28:21.717 --> 02:28:22.718]  We've seen reports
[02:28:23.467 --> 02:28:30.793]  That the leverage is anywhere between 40 and 100 to 1 on the LBMA in London in both silver and gold contracts.
[02:28:31.653 --> 02:28:42.201]  We also see gold and silver going up and not a lot of movement to the upside by the ETFs, GLD and SLV.
[02:28:42.942 --> 02:28:51.328]  And we see giant short positions in the gold producing gold and silver shares and even some of the smaller companies.
[02:28:51.889 --> 02:29:01.073]  And if gold runs away and silver runs away to the upside, I can promise you there'll be blood on the moon, because they're gonna have to cover.
[02:29:01.613 --> 02:29:05.975]  And that'll catapult the price higher during the next couple of months.
[02:29:06.015 --> 02:29:13.077]  What about Bloomberg's report of two weeks ago that it's $1,500 of gold, that that's what the majority of the futures are in December?
[02:29:13.097 --> 02:29:14.198]  Did he put any stake in that?
[02:29:14.218 --> 02:29:15.878]  I mean, that's what they say that's the case.
[02:29:15.918 --> 02:29:16.779]  I guess they can look it up?
[02:29:18.159 --> 02:29:19.220]  Yes, that is so.
[02:29:20.661 --> 02:29:21.702]  That's a ways away.
[02:29:22.122 --> 02:29:28.187]  Whether that can be attained remains to be seen, but that's what speculation in the market is all about.
[02:29:28.308 --> 02:29:34.593]  But that's like Vegas is normally right with what they're saying on a horse race or a boxing match.
[02:29:34.633 --> 02:29:37.535]  I mean, does that have as much validity as Vegas?
[02:29:40.257 --> 02:29:41.018]  Probably more.
[02:29:41.799 --> 02:29:42.439]  Probably more.
[02:29:42.459 --> 02:29:42.900]  Okay, stay there.
[02:29:42.920 --> 02:29:47.944]  Let's finish up with gold and more of the Economic Outlook with Bob Schappen after this quick break and your phone calls.
[02:29:48.244 --> 02:29:48.704]  Stay with us.
[02:29:48.744 --> 02:29:49.185]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:51.092 --> 02:29:54.074]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.015 --> 02:29:57.817]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.199 --> 02:30:04.443]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:04.763 --> 02:30:08.826]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:09.087 --> 02:30:14.511]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:14.851 --> 02:30:17.053]  It's true, total government control of electric
[02:30:17.073 --> 02:30:20.995]  Electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:21.275 --> 02:30:24.557]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:24.858 --> 02:30:28.580]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:29.560 --> 02:30:31.942]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:32.322 --> 02:30:35.704]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:36.805 --> 02:30:40.707]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:40.947 --> 02:30:45.710]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:45.990 --> 02:30:50.013]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:31:00.017 --> 02:31:03.959]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:31:04.199 --> 02:31:10.242]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:31:10.602 --> 02:31:17.705]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:31:17.985 --> 02:31:22.547]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:31:35.785 --> 02:31:41.967]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:31:42.547 --> 02:31:45.968]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[02:33:13.071 --> 02:33:14.092]  Thomas Jefferson.
[02:33:14.632 --> 02:33:18.315]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:28.231 --> 02:33:30.833]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[02:33:30.913 --> 02:33:33.675]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[02:33:37.277 --> 02:33:38.818]  Bob Chapman is our guest.
[02:33:38.838 --> 02:33:43.822]  We're going to go to John, Mark, Aaron, Michael, and Bill, and a few others for him in just a moment.
[02:33:44.642 --> 02:33:53.088]  And I want to get his take on the overall economic outlook with the inflation, joblessness, the unemployment numbers.
[02:33:53.448 --> 02:33:57.091]  But I briefly wanted to bring Ted Anderson up, the owner of the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:57.671 --> 02:34:03.437]  I mean, before he even had the Genesis Network 14 years ago, he was one of my first sponsors in gold and silver.
[02:34:04.338 --> 02:34:12.127]  And we keep telling people, back when gold was 280 bucks an ounce, we told you to get gold and silver.
[02:34:12.728 --> 02:34:14.950]  Back when silver was five, six dollars an ounce, now it's over 20.
[02:34:15.971 --> 02:34:16.151]  I think?
[02:34:33.775 --> 02:34:46.183]  When they start allowing megabanks to sell fake derivatives, counterfeit instruments, when they do this, and when the government's spending double or triple now what it brings in revenue, you're going to have currency devaluation.
[02:34:46.203 --> 02:34:47.484]  You're going to have joblessness.
[02:34:47.724 --> 02:34:48.885]  You're going to have a depression.
[02:34:48.905 --> 02:34:50.646]  I mean, we're not rocket scientists, okay?
[02:34:50.766 --> 02:34:53.648]  This is common sense stuff, like I said last hour.
[02:34:54.589 --> 02:35:02.955]  When the insert of the different flu vaccines says it can cause Guillain-Barré's, cancer, infertility, narcolepsy,
[02:35:03.975 --> 02:35:04.575]  Don't take it.
[02:35:05.576 --> 02:35:05.916]  Okay?
[02:35:06.656 --> 02:35:08.257]  It's like these drug ads on TV.
[02:35:08.637 --> 02:35:10.878]  The side effects are worse than what it supposedly treats.
[02:35:11.419 --> 02:35:12.259]  This is a no-brainer.
[02:35:13.139 --> 02:35:16.801]  And Ted is almost out of the gold and silver at the lower price.
[02:35:16.821 --> 02:35:20.883]  It already went up some, but he still was able to buy gold and silver when it was lower.
[02:35:22.004 --> 02:35:22.924]  And it's a great deal.
[02:35:23.424 --> 02:35:30.187]  He's got the silver half dollars that are going for $26 most places.
[02:35:30.227 --> 02:35:30.828]  The better deals are $20.
[02:35:32.635 --> 02:35:35.257]  23 for a full one ounce coin.
[02:35:36.238 --> 02:35:36.538]  What is it?
[02:35:36.558 --> 02:35:39.780]  16 bucks, 15 bucks for the half ounce coin.
[02:35:41.862 --> 02:35:43.763]  In fact, Ted's got all the technical numbers on this.
[02:35:43.963 --> 02:35:48.646]  I just know you can't get one of these silver half dollars for less than $12 out there, and he's got them for 10.
[02:35:49.327 --> 02:35:56.972]  So, Ted, briefly, tell us about those specific specials and how much silver's in the coin, how much gold is in the franc.
[02:35:57.012 --> 02:35:59.774]  Explain that to everybody, because sometimes I get it slightly wrong.
[02:36:00.647 --> 02:36:08.171]  Yeah, I know, and it's easy to do because the governments never made them exactly to follow the Everdepois system.
[02:36:08.692 --> 02:36:18.818]  They weren't doing that until about 1971 when the Krugerrand came out, and that was the first coin that ever really reflected that particular measurement of weights and measure.
[02:36:19.238 --> 02:36:21.979]  But the Walking Liberty half that we've been talking about at $9.95, that
[02:36:23.500 --> 02:36:26.142]  I mean just about anywhere now they're at 13 bucks plus.
[02:36:27.202 --> 02:36:30.805]  Contains right between a third and a half of an ounce.
[02:36:30.985 --> 02:36:36.468]  It's 0.36165 I think that's actually I'm just going off of my memory it's pretty close.
[02:36:37.529 --> 02:36:44.053]  The Frank coin again it's I call it a fifth of an ounce of gold but it's a fifth of an ounce would be 0.2 right on the nose.
[02:36:44.093 --> 02:36:46.194]  Well you got to remember troy ounces weren't measured
[02:36:46.784 --> 02:36:52.607]  Back then it was called a 20 franc and that was the measurement that was done all throughout Europe.
[02:36:52.667 --> 02:36:55.409]  It's just hair short of a fifth of an ounce.
[02:36:57.775 --> 02:37:00.437]  .185 something, you know, it's just almost right there.
[02:37:00.497 --> 02:37:02.298]  So I call it a fifth of an ounce.
[02:37:03.238 --> 02:37:04.339]  That's what everybody does.
[02:37:04.399 --> 02:37:06.180]  And the coin is trading right now at $275.
[02:37:06.781 --> 02:37:20.750]  If you take that coin and you subtract the fact that I'm buying everybody a full year subscription to the Bob Chapman's International Forecaster that buys the coin, I mean, right now you're talking about just a little bit under $560 an ounce for gold.
[02:37:22.931 --> 02:37:24.834]  And now everybody knows that gold's going up.
[02:37:24.894 --> 02:37:26.856]  I mean, right now, gold is sitting at $277.60.
[02:37:26.896 --> 02:37:27.877]  And we've seen a high today already of $1,200.
[02:37:27.917 --> 02:37:28.498]  I mean, it's $277.60.
[02:37:28.538 --> 02:37:28.498]  $1,277.60.
[02:37:28.979 --> 02:37:30.480]  And we've seen a high today of $1,281.10.
[02:37:38.996 --> 02:37:43.257]  You know, Bob's saying that we're going to have $1,300 an ounce gold.
[02:37:43.977 --> 02:37:51.679]  I can tell you right now, all you need is a $20 increase in gold and not even that now in order to see $1,300 an ounce gold.
[02:37:51.859 --> 02:37:53.500]  That is like just such a no-brainer.
[02:37:53.700 --> 02:38:01.022]  Unless if something happens between now and perhaps the next few days where there's a large sell-off and it cracks,
[02:38:02.022 --> 02:38:06.324]  You know, that three-week time period that Bob is talking about is probably conservative.
[02:38:06.364 --> 02:38:10.545]  It could happen next week, or even toward the end of today's... Well, let me stop you, though.
[02:38:10.585 --> 02:38:17.248]  I mean, let me quantify the fact that you are selling a silver half-dollar that I see on the web for $13, $14, $15, $16.
[02:38:17.348 --> 02:38:18.228]  You're selling it for how much?
[02:38:21.883 --> 02:38:22.404]  We're good to go.
[02:38:40.342 --> 02:38:42.684]  You know, and that's the bottom line there.
[02:38:42.704 --> 02:38:47.047]  I mean, if you're interested in that Walking Liberty half, you're not going to find that better somewhere else.
[02:38:47.508 --> 02:38:53.673]  And you're not going to be able to buy a Frank for $275, get a four-year subscription to Bob Chapman's newsletter.
[02:38:53.913 --> 02:38:56.535]  I mean, that $275 is hard to find to start with.
[02:38:56.575 --> 02:38:57.816]  Yeah, but let's be clear, Ted.
[02:38:57.836 --> 02:38:58.417]  They're not $900 a piece.
[02:38:58.437 --> 02:38:58.897]  They're $9 and what?
[02:39:01.619 --> 02:39:02.600]  Yeah, $9.95.
[02:39:03.121 --> 02:39:05.363]  I apologize, I'm getting too many numbers.
[02:39:05.503 --> 02:39:06.023]  Oh no!
[02:39:06.224 --> 02:39:08.966]  Listen, that's why I've got you up here, because I can't keep track of all this.
[02:39:09.347 --> 02:39:14.051]  And all over the web, they're selling these for $12, $13, $14, $15, $16 a coin.
[02:39:14.371 --> 02:39:16.113]  Yeah, that's what it is.
[02:39:16.173 --> 02:39:17.895]  How long can you hold it at that deal?
[02:39:18.115 --> 02:39:22.036]  I am going to be holding this deal until Sunday night.
[02:39:22.216 --> 02:39:23.716]  Not Monday, Sunday night.
[02:39:23.816 --> 02:39:25.477]  Because the prices have already gone up.
[02:39:25.717 --> 02:39:27.657]  Silver shot up over $20 an ounce.
[02:39:28.057 --> 02:39:29.738]  I don't think we're going to see silver hold down.
[02:39:29.758 --> 02:39:32.178]  Okay, and what do you have in gold coins at the lower price?
[02:39:32.378 --> 02:39:35.279]  Well, again, I have a neat little supply.
[02:39:35.319 --> 02:39:37.779]  We do have some of those buffalo coins.
[02:39:37.839 --> 02:39:40.420]  If you want to get them, it's going to be first come, first served.
[02:39:41.100 --> 02:39:53.589]  We have some $10 Liberties and $20 Liberties that are just touching like the $20 Liberties just getting into the $1,600 level and with gold spot right now at $1,277 this being a hundred-year-old coin.
[02:39:56.131 --> 02:39:56.452]  I think?
[02:40:15.052 --> 02:40:18.515]  But again, all that stuff is really at a very good price right now.
[02:40:18.976 --> 02:40:25.441]  And Alex, come on, with what the economy is doing right now and what's going on worldwide, I mean, China.
[02:40:25.962 --> 02:40:37.512]  If you take a look at what the World Gold Council is saying about China, if China just catches up to Singapore and some of the Vietnam and some of those countries just around them as far as how much gold is held per person,
[02:40:38.132 --> 02:40:40.093]  I mean, it's going to throw gold right through the roof.
[02:40:40.493 --> 02:40:50.598]  You know, India, and not to mention what's going on in the Western world, and yet still, only about 20% of the people are even starting to get involved with gold at this particular time.
[02:40:50.919 --> 02:40:56.761]  Everybody else is still tied up in the banks and the stock market, thinking that we're going to have an economic return of some kind.
[02:40:56.821 --> 02:41:03.645]  I mean, you know, people better be diversifying into gold, and it just only makes sense that people get involved at this time.
[02:41:07.119 --> 02:41:08.021]  Absolutely, Ted.
[02:41:08.041 --> 02:41:09.683]  Well, let's give people the toll-free number.
[02:41:09.763 --> 02:41:10.784]  It's 800-686-2237.
[02:41:10.964 --> 02:41:13.768]  I hope folks will take advantage of this.
[02:41:13.788 --> 02:41:14.649]  800-686-2237.
[02:41:14.709 --> 02:41:19.155]  And you've also got a deal when they buy one frank.
[02:41:19.796 --> 02:41:20.858]  It's already a really great deal.
[02:41:21.258 --> 02:41:21.939]  A wonderful deal.
[02:41:21.959 --> 02:41:23.900]  They get a free one-year subscription.
[02:41:24.341 --> 02:41:25.262]  What is that?
[02:41:25.742 --> 02:41:30.666]  $159 value of the hard copy or the twice-a-week digital copy of the International Forecaster.
[02:41:30.967 --> 02:41:37.592]  Or they can call and just get a free one-time introductory copy of Vital Intelligence from Bob Chapman.
[02:41:37.793 --> 02:41:39.294]  They can also call the main number for that.
[02:41:39.314 --> 02:41:39.354]  800-686-2237.
[02:41:39.374 --> 02:41:39.414]  800-686-2237.
[02:41:39.534 --> 02:41:41.136]  Ted Anderson, thank you so much.
[02:41:46.300 --> 02:41:47.621]  Yeah, thanks Alex for having me up.
[02:41:47.761 --> 02:41:48.041]  You bet.
[02:41:48.061 --> 02:41:49.042]  There goes Ted Anderson.
[02:41:49.322 --> 02:41:52.444]  I like to get Ted up because I can't keep track of all these gold and silver prices.
[02:41:52.785 --> 02:41:56.888]  All I know is when I go out and shop it, always the best deal I can find is Ted Anderson.
[02:41:57.168 --> 02:42:03.112]  His regular deals are great, but these radio specials... Well, Bob, you're a gold and silver expert, one of the biggest out there.
[02:42:03.172 --> 02:42:05.253]  Are those great deals he just offered on gold and silver?
[02:42:06.014 --> 02:42:06.855]  They certainly are.
[02:42:07.055 --> 02:42:07.915]  They certainly are.
[02:42:08.015 --> 02:42:15.801]  And you can just see the history of the last year when he's been offering that frank
[02:42:17.149 --> 02:42:24.875]  I think he started about $135 or $140, and now it's moved up to $175, and that's below the actual market.
[02:42:25.675 --> 02:42:27.837]  And the same thing with the Liberties.
[02:42:29.038 --> 02:42:34.162]  He started around $750, and now they're $10, and on eBay they're higher.
[02:42:34.803 --> 02:42:42.849]  And so those are very good buys, and it's a good way for people who are not in coins to get started in coins.
[02:42:43.636 --> 02:42:49.260]  And, you know, maybe buy some other different coins or more of the French francs.
[02:42:50.040 --> 02:42:55.184]  And it's also a great way to get introduced to the International Forecaster at no cost.
[02:42:56.284 --> 02:43:06.291]  I mean, the publication, I've been publishing it for over 20 years, and anything that you need to know every week is in that publication.
[02:43:06.711 --> 02:43:07.792]  The things that are not
[02:43:09.003 --> 02:43:10.164]  On the mainline media.
[02:43:10.424 --> 02:43:14.106]  Of course that exempts Alex because he covers lots of what I do.
[02:43:14.606 --> 02:43:16.467]  But not everybody listens to Alex.
[02:43:16.547 --> 02:43:18.929]  So sometimes you don't have time.
[02:43:19.509 --> 02:43:26.133]  And so you pick up the International Forecaster on Wednesdays and Saturdays and you spend an hour reading it and you know what's going on.
[02:43:26.741 --> 02:43:28.102]  No, it's invaluable information.
[02:43:28.142 --> 02:43:29.383]  Let's go to phone calls here.
[02:43:29.403 --> 02:43:31.845]  Well, I want to make this final point.
[02:43:32.426 --> 02:43:34.407]  We're not happy about being right, folks.
[02:43:34.667 --> 02:43:41.272]  I'm not happy when I get a Rockefeller Foundation document that they're sure enough adding hormones to vaccines to covertly sterilize women.
[02:43:41.733 --> 02:43:43.114]  We're not happy when we're proven right.
[02:43:43.494 --> 02:43:44.935]  We're not happy when...
[02:43:45.896 --> 02:43:51.600]  Gold and silver goes up, because it means the dollar is deteriorating, it means our future's deteriorating.
[02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:57.684]  But it's a stopgap measure, and it's just like Bloomberg said, people are rushing into it on safe haven.
[02:43:58.284 --> 02:44:04.409]  And so, you know, we're just here adapting and trying to overcome and trying to survive like everybody else, and we wish
[02:44:05.409 --> 02:44:11.451]  That the dollar was strong and our industry was strong and the economy was strong, but it's not and it's just that simple.
[02:44:11.531 --> 02:44:12.051]  We're right.
[02:44:12.131 --> 02:44:12.791]  We've been right.
[02:44:12.871 --> 02:44:13.932]  We know what we're talking about.
[02:44:13.952 --> 02:44:14.692]  It's just that simple.
[02:44:15.032 --> 02:44:16.333]  Let's talk to John in Washington.
[02:44:16.353 --> 02:44:17.373]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[02:44:18.253 --> 02:44:20.814]  Hey, good afternoon gentlemen, calling here from Seattle.
[02:44:21.174 --> 02:44:23.515]  Hey Bob, a couple quick questions for you.
[02:44:23.935 --> 02:44:26.896]  What about palladium and platinum in your metals mix?
[02:44:27.572 --> 02:44:31.414]  And then, you know, I emailed you once and you responded, just as Alex said, you always would.
[02:44:31.794 --> 02:44:35.595]  And you talked about income trusts, income producing trusts.
[02:44:35.715 --> 02:44:40.257]  Is there certain sectors that you would be interested in that, or even specific ones that you would look at?
[02:44:40.557 --> 02:44:44.439]  But I think you probably maybe just want to highlight certain sectors in that area.
[02:44:45.299 --> 02:44:50.562]  Well, first of all, with platinum and palladium, the performance has been spectacular.
[02:44:51.862 --> 02:44:56.384]  And in fact, they've even gone further ahead percentage-wise than gold and silver have.
[02:44:57.236 --> 02:45:03.638]  But they are basically industrial metals, and much more so than gold and silver.
[02:45:04.418 --> 02:45:12.020]  And so I think there'll be a catch-up by gold and silver on a percentage basis over the next couple of years.
[02:45:13.040 --> 02:45:17.141]  But they have done very well, and they are good investments.
[02:45:18.521 --> 02:45:26.003]  I like the fact that gold and silver have been monetary metals in the past, and I always look forward to the time
[02:45:26.627 --> 02:45:34.310]  That maybe we might have enough problems that we have to use them to commence trade with.
[02:45:35.050 --> 02:45:51.236]  And so I like to stick to them, but Platinum and Palladium have done very well and probably will continue to, but probably not as good a performance as Gold and Silver because they've already run up in front of them.
[02:45:53.237 --> 02:45:55.318]  The other part of the question was,
[02:45:57.365 --> 02:45:58.426]  Income-producing trusts.
[02:45:59.347 --> 02:45:59.747]  Oh, yes.
[02:46:00.367 --> 02:46:06.432]  The only ones that I have looked at and have liked are the oil and gas trusts.
[02:46:06.712 --> 02:46:08.593]  Exactly, those family partnerships.
[02:46:08.693 --> 02:46:11.255]  It can also be used as a family partnership, correct?
[02:46:12.616 --> 02:46:16.359]  Right, and they're yielding about 7% a month.
[02:46:17.060 --> 02:46:20.342]  You know, 7% on an annualized basis, and they pay every month.
[02:46:20.902 --> 02:46:24.385]  And for people who are elderly, who need more income,
[02:46:26.320 --> 02:46:27.501]  Then that's a good way to go.
[02:46:28.322 --> 02:46:41.916]  But it's not without risk, too, because if the price of oil went to $40 a barrel, the value of the security that you purchased certainly would go down, even though the dividend would still be there for you.
[02:46:42.796 --> 02:46:45.980]  On the other hand, if oil were to go from $75 to $115 a barrel,
[02:46:49.073 --> 02:46:53.076]  Then the value of the security, the trust, would go up.
[02:46:53.616 --> 02:46:55.778]  And so there is a play in the market there.
[02:46:56.138 --> 02:46:58.499]  But you can't get that kind of yield anyplace else.
[02:46:58.980 --> 02:47:00.361]  And it's a natural resource.
[02:47:00.981 --> 02:47:06.565]  And with all the nasty things that are going on in the world, there's a good chance that they could make oil go higher.
[02:47:07.625 --> 02:47:11.228]  Well, it's just like gold or silver comes out of the ground or platinum.
[02:47:11.248 --> 02:47:15.511]  I mean, it's a raw material that has always had intrinsic value.
[02:47:15.551 --> 02:47:16.551]  I appreciate your call, John.
[02:47:16.772 --> 02:47:17.932]  Let's go to Mark in Oklahoma.
[02:47:17.952 --> 02:47:18.633]  You're on the air, Mark.
[02:47:21.153 --> 02:47:22.794]  Afternoon, how are you all doing this afternoon?
[02:47:22.834 --> 02:47:23.554]  Good sir, welcome.
[02:47:24.274 --> 02:47:32.095]  Hey, I woke up to your show about a couple years ago from an anonymous lady and believe it or not I can't even find her name in the phone book.
[02:47:32.355 --> 02:47:33.596]  I don't even know who she is now.
[02:47:33.696 --> 02:47:46.258]  So anyway, you can call that divine providence I guess, but I've been able to wake up several people here in Oklahoma and what I wanted to talk about is I went to an energy conference
[02:47:47.028 --> 02:47:53.112]  This past Wednesday here in Oklahoma, and a Rhodes Scholar was speaking as a keynote speaker at lunch.
[02:47:53.713 --> 02:47:57.815]  And he was talking about the CO2 and carbon trading and carbon taxes.
[02:47:58.396 --> 02:48:00.477]  And at the end, he opened it up for questions.
[02:48:01.178 --> 02:48:09.303]  And so I said that, you know, oil went from $80 to $140 very quickly.
[02:48:09.343 --> 02:48:14.127]  And I said that was in due large part to derivatives trading by Goldman Sachs bankers.
[02:48:14.687 --> 02:48:16.168]  And now you're sitting here telling us
[02:48:16.687 --> 02:48:25.011]  That we should trust the same people that are going to be allowed to trade these same derivatives on carbon, which would raise prices for all energy in general.
[02:48:25.051 --> 02:48:27.552]  And so that creates another economic choke point.
[02:48:28.293 --> 02:48:32.775]  So, why should we trust the very same people that got us into trouble in the first place?
[02:48:32.795 --> 02:48:34.856]  Well, Blush is a solution to a non-issue.
[02:48:36.096 --> 02:48:36.937]  What did he say to that?
[02:48:38.097 --> 02:48:40.138]  Well, he just, he had no comment.
[02:48:40.158 --> 02:48:43.600]  He was taken back by it that someone in the audience was even aware enough
[02:48:44.304 --> 02:48:49.848]  To ask the question, and I had several people that came up to me at the end and said, why don't you run for office?
[02:48:49.948 --> 02:48:52.469]  And I said, oh, no, if I was in office, I couldn't ask that question.
[02:48:52.489 --> 02:48:53.550]  Well, here's the good news.
[02:48:54.531 --> 02:49:03.076]  These different, you know, mercantile exchanges having these carbon credits, you know, they've gone from over $100 down to 50 cents.
[02:49:03.096 --> 02:49:04.377]  I mean, I've seen cases of that.
[02:49:04.577 --> 02:49:11.121]  They're all gone from blue chip, you know, high quality AAA stuff down to penny stocks.
[02:49:11.181 --> 02:49:11.722]  Bob Chapman?
[02:49:14.188 --> 02:49:15.128]  That's right.
[02:49:18.570 --> 02:49:35.277]  This business of carbon taxation is an absolute scam and of course the whole thing is run by Al Gore and other members of the Council on Foreign Relations, etc.
[02:49:35.977 --> 02:49:40.719]  This is the way they want to fund what they want to fund not only in the United States but worldwide.
[02:49:43.743 --> 02:49:45.244]  They just don't want to give up.
[02:49:45.324 --> 02:49:53.769]  I mean, you and I covered this in a big way about a year ago, especially when we were part of the group that exposed what was going on.
[02:49:54.630 --> 02:50:05.917]  And carbon taxes are just another scam, and I'm happy that this gentleman stood up and asked the hard question of, what do you mean?
[02:50:05.957 --> 02:50:06.598]  What are you doing?
[02:50:07.458 --> 02:50:10.120]  And the speaker had to back off.
[02:50:11.007 --> 02:50:17.254]  Just stand there and say nothing because someone had exposed him for what he was and just another phony.
[02:50:17.554 --> 02:50:27.926]  Well this gives the private bankers control over energy and they state the global government will be run by the six mega banks and they will charge you carbon taxes and you will pay them.
[02:50:28.426 --> 02:50:30.367]  And it's just a giant fraud.
[02:50:30.407 --> 02:50:32.007]  Hey, we're the bankers that ripped you off.
[02:50:32.407 --> 02:50:35.428]  Now, pay us money or the earth will die.
[02:50:35.488 --> 02:50:37.309]  I mean, it's the oldest trick in the book.
[02:50:37.829 --> 02:50:39.169]  And the good news is it's imploding.
[02:50:39.189 --> 02:50:44.551]  We're going to jam in Aaron, Michael, and Bill, maybe even Brian, in the final segment straight ahead with Bob Chapman.
[02:50:44.971 --> 02:50:45.631]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:50:45.651 --> 02:50:47.312]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:50:47.412 --> 02:50:51.453]  GCNlive.com is a great news website as well.
[02:50:51.473 --> 02:50:56.555]  They post a lot of our key reports and many others from Ron Paul and others at GCNlive.com.
[02:50:56.575 --> 02:50:57.795]  So for other news we haven't covered,
[02:50:58.055 --> 02:50:59.215]  TCNLive.com.
[02:51:00.836 --> 02:51:02.916]  You worry, but only because you're paying attention.
[02:51:03.356 --> 02:51:06.457]  What's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature.
[02:51:06.917 --> 02:51:14.899]  A similar audacity called GMO, or genetically modified organisms, means that the quality of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health in the balance.
[02:51:15.399 --> 02:51:20.320]  Now that summer's here, what better time to learn about the bounty that nature provides in wild edible food?
[02:51:20.881 --> 02:51:25.962]  Let author Linda Runyon show you the best-kept secret in plain sight that food is everywhere you look.
[02:51:26.502 --> 02:51:34.027]  This summer, for the cost of a good meal or two out, you can literally starvation-proof yourself and your loved ones against any future craziness, and put up tons of free food, too.
[02:51:34.547 --> 02:51:39.551]  Whatever experiment is being run on us, you can rest assured that Linda's 50 or so staple foods aren't involved.
[02:51:39.991 --> 02:51:41.212]  Our foods are their enemy.
[02:51:41.812 --> 02:51:47.274]  So go to ofthefield.com or call toll-free 1-888-51-EAT-FREE and take that first step.
[02:51:47.674 --> 02:51:50.335]  Make your oasis of food security and nutrition now.
[02:51:50.655 --> 02:51:55.597]  That's O-F-T-H-E-F-I-E-L-D dot com or call 1-888-513-2837.
[02:51:56.197 --> 02:51:59.939]  Start now and make 2010 your year of independence.
[02:52:00.679 --> 02:52:02.960]  They helped to create a new world order.
[02:52:02.980 --> 02:52:05.281]  We are part of a new world order.
[02:52:05.361 --> 02:52:08.062]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[02:52:08.582 --> 02:52:13.345]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:13.685 --> 02:52:17.907]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.207 --> 02:52:20.529]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:20.549 --> 02:52:23.090]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:23.430 --> 02:52:26.012]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:26.352 --> 02:52:33.956]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.272 --> 02:52:39.514]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:39.674 --> 02:52:41.955]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:41.975 --> 02:52:45.957]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:46.197 --> 02:52:47.097]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:47.117 --> 02:52:48.578]  You're everyone else.
[02:52:48.618 --> 02:52:49.638]  Invisible Empire.

[02:53:04.617 --> 02:53:05.659]  Afraid to answer it?
[02:53:06.600 --> 02:53:08.042]  Afraid to answer your door?
[02:53:08.482 --> 02:53:15.491]  Did you know that debt settlement, bankruptcy, and attorneys will cost you about 10 times more than you would legally be required to pay creditors?
[02:53:15.772 --> 02:53:17.834]  These are not ways to help you get out of debt.
[02:53:18.015 --> 02:53:19.777]  They are expensive payment plans.
[02:53:20.017 --> 02:53:22.961]  And if you're in debt already, does it make sense to load yourself
[02:53:23.001 --> 02:53:23.321]  I think so.

[02:54:07.432 --> 02:54:19.579]  Alright, it's a final segment here.
[02:54:19.619 --> 02:54:24.342]  We're just doing our best to get people to wake up to how crazy things have gotten.
[02:54:25.042 --> 02:54:26.683]  And this happens every time in history.
[02:54:26.703 --> 02:54:31.986]  You let corruption take over, it gets worse and worse and worse until the society collapses and the crooks don't care.
[02:54:33.191 --> 02:54:43.514]  It's outrageous, but now they've engineered the collapse into their profit scheme, with the White House Science Czar now giving press conferences saying, post-industrial, we want to destroy America!
[02:54:43.854 --> 02:54:45.615]  And they're clapping, yay!
[02:54:45.695 --> 02:54:46.615]  It's wonderful!
[02:54:47.696 --> 02:54:50.116]  The depression's good to lower our carbon footprint!
[02:54:50.456 --> 02:54:52.157]  You can't make up stuff like this!
[02:54:53.978 --> 02:54:56.458]  Up next is Aaron in California, you're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[02:54:57.239 --> 02:55:01.700]  Hey, Alex and Bob, thanks for taking my call, and I'd just like to say I'm a new listener,
[02:55:02.455 --> 02:55:08.857]  First time caller and reason why I'm a new listener is because of my buddy who's a city inspector down there in Austin.
[02:55:09.557 --> 02:55:10.897]  He's a big fan of yours.
[02:55:11.537 --> 02:55:13.798]  Anyway, I just want to get to my question here.
[02:55:14.298 --> 02:55:17.539]  I wanted to ask Bob and you, where do you think the economy is going?
[02:55:17.579 --> 02:55:21.060]  Because in my situation, me and my wife, we
[02:55:22.080 --> 02:55:22.160]  I'm
[02:55:36.770 --> 02:55:41.974]  I believe some laws were passed to make them do that, but it's not being enforced, Bob.
[02:56:07.737 --> 02:56:12.058]  That's correct, and the banks really don't want to make any deals.
[02:56:12.858 --> 02:56:16.780]  They just as soon have the houses and dump them into the market.
[02:56:17.660 --> 02:56:22.681]  And I think they're going to end up with a lot of houses, and I think that's the final intention.
[02:56:23.201 --> 02:56:26.282]  But I think you should see how it goes.
[02:56:27.062 --> 02:56:28.863]  Are you in Southern California?
[02:56:31.143 --> 02:56:31.604]  Yes.
[02:56:31.884 --> 02:56:32.464]  He said yes.
[02:56:32.504 --> 02:56:33.384]  His audio was real low.
[02:56:34.364 --> 02:56:36.945]  Oh, and so I think you can expect
[02:56:38.574 --> 02:56:46.677]  Uh, next year that you'll probably, and maybe into the year after, you'll probably see another 10 to 20 percent drop in the value of the home.
[02:56:47.418 --> 02:56:54.240]  But if you're willing to stay there, and you can make the payments, uh, and that doesn't bother you, that's fine.
[02:56:54.820 --> 02:57:01.203]  But on the other hand, if you don't want to continue to be in an underwater home, you just walk away from it.
[02:57:01.563 --> 02:57:03.884]  Well, see, in California as a state, you can do that.
[02:57:04.488 --> 02:57:09.429]  Well, the thing is, what I'm afraid of is if the economy crashes, I'd like to be prepared.
[02:57:09.909 --> 02:57:16.110]  And it just doesn't make sense for us to keep spending $4,000 a month versus $2,000 a month in renting.
[02:57:16.130 --> 02:57:17.430]  But the thing is, I got kids.
[02:57:17.950 --> 02:57:21.731]  And I want to make sure my kids are safe and protected and taken care of that I can provide for them.
[02:57:21.771 --> 02:57:25.272]  Well, I understand you live in California, but that's the state I'd get out of.
[02:57:25.332 --> 02:57:30.772]  I mean, if you have your druthers and could get out of California, I'm not telling you what to do with your particular case, sir.
[02:57:31.133 --> 02:57:33.713]  But me, I wouldn't be anywhere near California, Bob.
[02:57:35.379 --> 02:57:36.280]  Move to Austin.
[02:57:39.423 --> 02:57:42.566]  But, you know, the point is, the best thing to do is really to walk away.
[02:57:42.706 --> 02:57:44.728]  That's a large monthly payment.
[02:57:45.569 --> 02:57:50.853]  And you can rent a house in California for probably $1,800, $2,000 a month.
[02:57:50.893 --> 02:57:52.155]  That's a heck of a lot cheaper.
[02:57:52.595 --> 02:58:01.023]  Well, God bless you, and I thank you all for your advice, and thanks, Alex, for doing our country, or, you know, for everything you do out there.
[02:58:03.030 --> 02:58:05.031]  Okay, well listen, we're almost out of time, Aaron.
[02:58:05.051 --> 02:58:06.793]  Sorry to hear that you're in that situation.
[02:58:06.813 --> 02:58:10.055]  That's why it's so painful to really be aware of what these globalists have done.
[02:58:10.075 --> 02:58:13.197]  But thank you, Michael, Bill, Brian, Jesse.
[02:58:13.217 --> 02:58:13.797]  We're out of time.
