[00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.864]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:00:07.464 --> 00:00:10.506]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:13.748 --> 00:00:17.190]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen, eight minutes into the second hour.
[00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.373]  We're here Monday through Friday, 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[00:00:21.513 --> 00:00:22.494]  Eastern, 11 a.m.
[00:00:22.514 --> 00:00:23.074]  to 3 p.m.
[00:00:23.394 --> 00:00:24.875]  Central Standard Time.
[00:00:25.396 --> 00:00:28.437]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:00:29.418 --> 00:00:32.580]  In the last hour, I went over the new fake Bin Laden tapes.
[00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.062]  They've been forced to admit that past tapes have been fake.
[00:00:35.663 --> 00:00:42.768]  They're now bringing him back as the boogeyman to sell new wars, naked body scanners, police state domestically.
[00:00:42.968 --> 00:00:57.598]  I believe with Obama's approval rating plunging, their entire agenda for the government takeover of health care, for new wars, for the flu hoax falling on its face, the Copenhagen global tax falling on its face, I've been saying for months
[00:00:58.482 --> 00:01:02.585]  That I believe they're getting ready to launch a new false flag terror attack.
[00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:05.047]  That is coming up later in the broadcast.
[00:01:05.067 --> 00:01:07.368]  We're going to be breaking that down.
[00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.793]  Also, we've got just incredible video and photos of new police brutality.
[00:01:15.234 --> 00:01:19.017]  Breaking arms, breaking legs, beating people half to death for no reason.
[00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:23.192]  On video and then charging them.
[00:01:24.113 --> 00:01:26.474]  Charging them with assaulting the police.
[00:01:27.074 --> 00:01:28.514]  A new level of corruption.
[00:01:28.554 --> 00:01:31.516]  A new level of open tyranny and evil.
[00:01:31.616 --> 00:01:32.896]  They don't even care if you have video of it.
[00:01:32.936 --> 00:01:33.717]  It's clearly a fraud.
[00:01:33.957 --> 00:01:36.798]  They're that secure in their criminal activity.
[00:01:37.685 --> 00:01:39.826]  So we're going to be going over that as well.
[00:01:39.946 --> 00:01:52.571]  Obviously, in the last hour, I spent the lion's share of our time together going over the fact that the Justice Department admits they're running a nationwide program, but particularly in the border states, under the guise of stopping weapons trafficking into Mexico.
[00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:53.692]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[00:01:54.352 --> 00:01:59.674]  Though most of the guns are sold to the drug cartels by the military and the police, and that's on record.
[00:01:59.694 --> 00:02:00.494]  They're fully automatic.
[00:02:00.714 --> 00:02:04.016]  A lot of Mexicans are buying guns here to go back to Mexico to protect themselves.
[00:02:04.536 --> 00:02:06.857]  Mexico has total gun ban for citizens.
[00:02:06.877 --> 00:02:10.778]  And notice they have one of the highest crime rates in the world and are on the verge of collapsing.
[00:02:11.118 --> 00:02:12.359]  Also, drugs are illegal there.
[00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:13.339]  That drives up the price.
[00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.481]  Drug prohibition is what is allowing this to happen.
[00:02:18.141 --> 00:02:19.762]  But they're, through a hoax,
[00:02:21.405 --> 00:02:23.647]  Saying that private gun sales are illegal.
[00:02:23.727 --> 00:02:29.112]  Earlier I played a KI piece from here in Austin that was completely twisted and said the police are just enforcing the law.
[00:02:29.532 --> 00:02:30.993]  There's illegal gun sales going on.
[00:02:31.033 --> 00:02:34.056]  You've got to sign paperwork and go to an FFL dealer to buy guns.
[00:02:34.997 --> 00:02:36.758]  They've passed laws in many other states.
[00:02:36.778 --> 00:02:40.922]  They're trying in Texas to quote get rid of the gun show loophole.
[00:02:41.823 --> 00:02:44.085]  And what they do with that
[00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:51.554]  Is the way the laws are written in other states, what they've tried to pass in Texas since 2000, they've tried over and over again.
[00:02:52.715 --> 00:02:58.077]  What they're trying to do is pass laws where a grandfather can't give his grandson a .22 rifle.
[00:02:59.885 --> 00:03:05.493]  They're trying to pass laws where your father dies and you can't be given his guns.
[00:03:05.553 --> 00:03:07.756]  It's got to be gone to the feds and transferred to you.
[00:03:08.997 --> 00:03:10.079]  That's the gun show loophole.
[00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.300]  Private sales of guns.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.462]  I can sell my neighbor a gun.
[00:03:13.002 --> 00:03:14.364]  I can sell one of my employees a gun.
[00:03:14.404 --> 00:03:15.265]  They can sell me a gun.
[00:03:16.627 --> 00:03:18.427]  You've seen the federal regulation.
[00:03:18.447 --> 00:03:20.368]  In fact, pull up that article for me.
[00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:23.209]  Prison time for garage sale.
[00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:25.729]  A list of tens of thousands of recalled items.
[00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:27.089]  You have no idea what's going on.
[00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:33.951]  The feds are deputizing local police with special units to harass bazaars, flea markets, garage sales.
[00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:37.732]  They're busting people all the time at garage sales, selling a couple of their guns.
[00:03:38.732 --> 00:03:42.976]  This is illegal, what they're doing, but the news all over the country is running hoax reports.
[00:03:43.196 --> 00:03:47.039]  It's now national news, what happened in Austin, where they shut down the Austin Gun Show.
[00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.503]  First they denied that, now they said they did it through nuisance abatement or the crack house law.
[00:03:52.564 --> 00:04:02.893]  So we're going to be breaking that down more, and I want to just remind listeners that I get so tied down... Yeah, that's McClatchy Newspapers.
[00:04:02.933 --> 00:04:04.575]  Feds cracking down on garage sales.
[00:04:07.068 --> 00:04:16.415]  Try to give me the Fox one where it actually says, um, jail time or jail time for Garage Sales Fox News.
[00:04:16.836 --> 00:04:18.056]  Or Garage Sales Fox News.
[00:04:18.337 --> 00:04:19.738]  The search should pull it up.
[00:04:19.758 --> 00:04:21.959]  People won't believe that unless they actually see the articles.
[00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:23.981]  That was McClatchy there.
[00:04:25.122 --> 00:04:28.344]  Okay, um, we need to stand up against this.
[00:04:28.404 --> 00:04:29.325]  We need to say no to this.
[00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:39.580]  There's a bigger issue to just the Second Amendment and them shutting down the gun show as a case point example.
[00:04:42.744 --> 00:04:48.992]  And that is that they did this without a law and the media now is engaged in a hoax saying it was the law.
[00:04:50.649 --> 00:05:04.934]  So the police under federal control, and Ace Veda obviously supports this, the police chief, are just saying, we don't care, we're going to do what we want to do, we don't care, we can't pass this through the legislature, so we're just going to do this.
[00:05:04.954 --> 00:05:10.996]  And the Attorney General needs to get involved with what's happening in Austin, because the police are, quote, the authorities.
[00:05:11.736 --> 00:05:15.837]  And they just start making stuff up, and I know a lot of police officers are upset about this.
[00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:21.179]  I've got a lot of emails from Austin Police, phone calls from Austin Police, and we've had calls from police all over the country.
[00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:22.339]  They don't like this.
[00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:29.041]  In national polls, 98% in a police survey a few years ago believe in the Second Amendment, believe we need less laws, not more.
[00:05:29.542 --> 00:05:36.804]  So, there are a lot of good police out there, but there are a lot of bad ones being protected and bad ones being promoted.
[00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.992]  And so I don't want to paint with a broad brush here, but the leadership is bad and is out of control.
[00:05:43.872 --> 00:05:47.393]  And Arte Cerveda may think that he can have warrantless checkpoints for blood.
[00:05:47.853 --> 00:05:48.593]  He couldn't.
[00:05:49.294 --> 00:05:52.575]  He went to the legislature, got them to pass a law they could take blood without warrants.
[00:05:52.955 --> 00:05:54.715]  But I've talked to local judges and others.
[00:05:54.755 --> 00:05:56.756]  They say it will be overturned by the Texas Supreme Court.
[00:05:56.776 --> 00:05:58.416]  But for the time being, he's out there.
[00:05:59.117 --> 00:06:01.737]  And he really believes, you know, that we'll save some people if we do this.
[00:06:01.757 --> 00:06:02.398]  It doesn't matter.
[00:06:02.978 --> 00:06:04.678]  You don't go down that road.
[00:06:04.718 --> 00:06:06.579]  The road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[00:06:08.168 --> 00:06:19.330]  Going back to Police Chief Art Acevedo and the fact that we're going to be protesting tonight down at the Austin Police Department.
[00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.491]  Local Austinites have organized this.
[00:06:21.511 --> 00:06:22.991]  5 to 7 p.m.
[00:06:23.111 --> 00:06:26.392]  I'm going to be there in front of the Austin Police Department.
[00:06:27.272 --> 00:06:29.652]  715 East 8th Street.
[00:06:29.812 --> 00:06:30.393]  I-35 and 8th Street.
[00:06:30.413 --> 00:06:33.473]  If you live outside Austin, you come down right down I-35.
[00:06:33.813 --> 00:06:37.374]  You take the 11th to 6th Street exit.
[00:06:38.536 --> 00:06:48.000]  You get off, it's on the west side of the highway, and there's plenty of parking underneath the overpass there, free parking.
[00:06:48.881 --> 00:06:51.622]  There's also meters if you want to pay or can't find parking.
[00:06:51.982 --> 00:06:53.203]  You park, get there at 5.
[00:06:53.943 --> 00:06:59.706]  The media will attempt, because they have a playbook on fooling people and lying, they enjoy it, the power trip.
[00:07:00.626 --> 00:07:02.867]  They will try to show up at 4.30 and only shoot 5 or 6 people.
[00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:07.532]  Only videotape 5 or 6 people and say that was the protest.
[00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:08.312]  It won't matter if we have 500.
[00:07:09.273 --> 00:07:11.894]  But we now can expose them.
[00:07:11.914 --> 00:07:14.295]  I know they're listening right now, but it's not going to work.
[00:07:16.176 --> 00:07:17.076]  That's the great thing.
[00:07:17.116 --> 00:07:20.918]  They keep acting like the internet isn't there, and that's why they're destroying themselves.
[00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:21.938]  So, you watch.
[00:07:21.978 --> 00:07:22.739]  I'm calling it now.
[00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:26.580]  The media will be there.
[00:07:27.361 --> 00:07:28.881]  They will show up before 5.
[00:07:29.402 --> 00:07:30.502]  They will shoot their piece.
[00:07:31.002 --> 00:07:32.423]  When 10 people are there, they will leave.
[00:07:32.443 --> 00:07:33.283]  They will not show 200, 300, 400 people.
[00:07:36.292 --> 00:07:41.116]  That will be another lesson to you in media fraud, media corruption, how they operate.
[00:07:41.156 --> 00:07:45.900]  You saw them early on in the Tea Party say, oh, it's just a few people, a few hundred, and there was 200,000.
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:50.263]  And then another one, they said there was 100,000 and there was more like a million.
[00:07:50.664 --> 00:07:51.604]  And that's what the D.C.
[00:07:51.645 --> 00:07:52.205]  police said.
[00:07:52.986 --> 00:07:58.290]  Or they said, Republican, early last year, Republicans were financing the entire Tea Party.
[00:08:01.038 --> 00:08:05.821]  That became a self-fulfilling prophecy as the Republicans did actually take it over.
[00:08:05.861 --> 00:08:11.245]  But at the time, Governor Rick Perry, Senator Cornyn here in Austin would go to tea parties and be booed off stage.
[00:08:11.805 --> 00:08:13.126]  And I tried to make that point.
[00:08:13.546 --> 00:08:15.948]  Then the Republicans did come in and take over a lot of it.
[00:08:16.148 --> 00:08:20.531]  But it was Ron Paul movement, the 9-11 truth movement before him, that started the tea parties.
[00:08:20.871 --> 00:08:24.933]  So we're going to be going over that today.
[00:08:25.414 --> 00:08:27.875]  I'm going to be there from about 4.30.
[00:08:30.163 --> 00:08:37.949]  Until 7 o'clock tonight, everybody needs to come out to this event.
[00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:42.193]  If the feds send provocateurs, I'm going to expose you.
[00:08:42.433 --> 00:08:44.215]  That may make them not come because I'm going.
[00:08:44.415 --> 00:08:45.576]  That's the main reason I've got to go.
[00:08:46.216 --> 00:08:51.280]  Because I'm going to identify you and I'm going to neutralize you with my video camera.
[00:08:52.101 --> 00:08:53.142]  I'm going to neutralize you.
[00:08:54.602 --> 00:08:55.282]  Gonna expose you.
[00:08:55.522 --> 00:08:56.742]  So just, I know you're coming.
[00:08:57.343 --> 00:08:57.843]  We're gonna be there.
[00:08:57.863 --> 00:08:59.523]  I'm gonna have cameras on me 24-7.
[00:08:59.563 --> 00:09:03.504]  If one of their hired anarchists tries to attack me or something, that's who works for them.
[00:09:04.124 --> 00:09:05.204]  But we're gonna be there.
[00:09:05.524 --> 00:09:06.944]  We need everybody in strength.
[00:09:07.024 --> 00:09:08.365]  This is the Alamo, folks.
[00:09:08.885 --> 00:09:12.646]  This is where they're going after the Second Amendment, right here in the land of Colonel Travis.
[00:09:13.406 --> 00:09:16.126]  They are going after our precious Second Amendment.
[00:09:16.546 --> 00:09:20.087]  And I want to see everybody there tonight.
[00:09:21.397 --> 00:09:25.258]  The police department straddles 8th Street and 6th Street.
[00:09:25.278 --> 00:09:29.079]  It's in between 8th Street and 6th Street, right off I-35 on the west side.
[00:09:29.439 --> 00:09:30.840]  You cannot miss it.
[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:37.682]  Now, one local group involved in kicking this off, Texas for Accountable Government, that does a lot of great work, I've noticed,
[00:09:40.273 --> 00:09:43.476]  They're saying bring holsters with copies of the Constitution in them.
[00:09:44.017 --> 00:09:46.459]  Just the holsters alone will scare the media to death.
[00:09:49.823 --> 00:09:52.686]  These people are so pathetic, how domesticated they've become.
[00:09:53.547 --> 00:09:58.011]  But yeah, I'll be there handing out evil pocket constitutions as well.
[00:09:59.031 --> 00:10:01.773]  And the police are taught that those are basically illegal.
[00:10:01.894 --> 00:10:02.414]  You don't believe me?
[00:10:02.434 --> 00:10:03.555]  I know that sounds asinine.
[00:10:04.075 --> 00:10:05.697]  We have Abby Newman pulled over at a checkpoint.
[00:10:05.717 --> 00:10:06.918]  They find a pocket constitution.
[00:10:07.178 --> 00:10:09.680]  The police start breathing heavy and go, oh my God, we've got an extremist.
[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:10.961]  We've got contraband.
[00:10:10.981 --> 00:10:13.683]  And they start asking the other commander, is this legal?
[00:10:13.964 --> 00:10:16.206]  And he says, I think she's allowed to maybe have that.
[00:10:16.886 --> 00:10:21.010]  The good guy thinks maybe she's allowed to have a pocket constitution.
[00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:22.551]  That's on video.
[00:10:23.171 --> 00:10:25.854]  So that's what these people have turned into.
[00:10:27.458 --> 00:10:31.982]  Now, it's not just the Second Amendment that's under attack, it's also the First Amendment.
[00:10:32.823 --> 00:10:35.085]  And coming up later in the hour, I'm going to play this Mark Dice video.
[00:10:35.105 --> 00:10:36.686]  I think it's the most powerful work to date.
[00:10:37.447 --> 00:10:38.408]  Mark's working right now.
[00:10:38.448 --> 00:10:40.029]  He can't come on until Thursday, but we'll have him here.
[00:10:40.049 --> 00:10:42.992]  And all of you can do the type of things Mark Dice does.
[00:10:43.352 --> 00:10:46.975]  And his videos get hundreds of thousands, in some cases millions of views.
[00:10:47.876 --> 00:10:55.582]  And he's just another tireless defender of liberty, and we suggest people buy his books and materials that we sell at InfoWars.com.
[00:10:55.602 --> 00:10:56.122]  But that's coming up.
[00:10:56.142 --> 00:10:58.384]  In fact, we're an hour and 19 minutes into the broadcast.

[00:11:59.881 --> 00:12:04.142]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:13:00.612 --> 00:13:04.260]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:13:04.641 --> 00:13:07.647]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:13:07.888 --> 00:13:09.311]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:13:10.006 --> 00:13:12.667]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:13:12.687 --> 00:13:18.948]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:13:19.068 --> 00:13:24.109]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:27.410]  All of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:34.252]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:13:34.372 --> 00:13:36.474]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:13:36.714 --> 00:13:38.035]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:13:38.295 --> 00:13:40.577]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:13:40.758 --> 00:13:42.599]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:13:42.879 --> 00:13:47.684]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:13:48.044 --> 00:13:52.808]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:13:53.048 --> 00:13:57.152]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:14:01.116 --> 00:14:02.117]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:14:02.517 --> 00:14:07.999]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.060]  That's right.
[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.661]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:14:11.981 --> 00:14:19.145]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:14:19.705 --> 00:14:27.394]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:14:27.855 --> 00:14:32.701]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:14:33.341 --> 00:14:36.385]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:14:39.128 --> 00:14:43.249]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:46.230]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.691]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:14:48.991 --> 00:14:51.311]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:14:51.471 --> 00:14:52.972]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:14:53.212 --> 00:15:02.615]  Have your house payments skyrocketed under an adjustable rate mortgage?
[00:15:03.155 --> 00:15:04.055]  Have you been laid off?
[00:15:04.475 --> 00:15:05.455]  Or had your hours cut?
[00:15:06.236 --> 00:15:07.536]  Are balloon payments coming due?
[00:15:08.459 --> 00:15:11.640]  You need help from MortgageFraudExaminers.com.
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:18.301]  To stop the housing crisis, Congress and the White House are pinning their hopes on homeowners renegotiating their mortgages.
[00:15:18.701 --> 00:15:22.402]  The trouble is, the banks are saying no 80% of the time.
[00:15:22.882 --> 00:15:27.383]  MortgageFraudExaminers.com can help you get the leverage you need to turn things around.
[00:15:27.823 --> 00:15:31.584]  They estimate that up to 85% of all mortgages are legally deficient.
[00:15:31.884 --> 00:15:37.585]  MortgageFraudExaminers.com can perform forensic loan audits and appraisals to find legal deficits in your mortgage.
[00:15:42.304 --> 00:15:43.325]  I'm in a news blitz coming up!
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:11.683]  Into the next hour, then we're going to get into the flu hoax that's completely collapsed.
[00:16:12.283 --> 00:16:23.389]  But it's like the ClimateGate emails opening up a whole world of fraud and hoaxes by the UN and those that want world government set up and Americans have to pay taxes to the IMF and World Bank and UN.
[00:16:23.789 --> 00:16:29.052]  We need to take this information and get it out to people, just like with the ClimateGate with the FluGate.
[00:16:30.523 --> 00:16:35.308]  And so Mike Adams joins us in the next hour on that important front.
[00:16:35.648 --> 00:16:39.371]  We do have a gun shop owner joining us.
[00:16:40.192 --> 00:16:49.401]  Remember a few months ago we got the flyers and confirmed that tattoo shops, feed stores, everybody are being asked, does somebody have burns on their hands?
[00:16:49.461 --> 00:16:50.322]  Are they buying chemicals?
[00:16:50.342 --> 00:16:51.363]  Are they buying fertilizer?
[00:16:51.903 --> 00:16:55.447]  Are they getting tattoos of patriot-type stuff?
[00:16:55.768 --> 00:16:57.309]  Report them as a potential terrorist?
[00:16:57.329 --> 00:16:59.352]  Getting Americans used to being spies?
[00:16:59.712 --> 00:17:01.674]  And again, most of the terrorists staged, if not all.
[00:17:03.056 --> 00:17:04.498]  So it's setting up the police grid.
[00:17:04.738 --> 00:17:12.146]  Well, now gun shops all over the country have been given FBI manuals, and they're told, you will follow this.
[00:17:13.143 --> 00:17:14.785]  Or the BATF will shut you down.
[00:17:15.906 --> 00:17:17.948]  And I want to go over the list of things.
[00:17:17.988 --> 00:17:19.810]  This is how they're going after the Second Amendment.
[00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:23.374]  They're using covert intelligence operations to do this.
[00:17:23.434 --> 00:17:25.056]  So here's a newscast on that.
[00:17:26.678 --> 00:17:34.186]  Appearing to be from the FBI, has been turning up at local gun and ammo shops, instructing employees there on how to identify suspected terrorists.
[00:17:34.587 --> 00:17:39.512]  But, some store owners say that its regulations might affect more than just enemies of the state.
[00:17:40.112 --> 00:17:45.138]  4029's Kyle Kabody found out today why the flyer might cause problems for regular customers.
[00:17:46.021 --> 00:17:50.746]  The flyer is designed to keep guns like this one out of the hands of suspected terrorists.
[00:17:50.826 --> 00:17:51.687]  Alright, pause.
[00:17:52.408 --> 00:17:58.355]  See, equating guns with terrorism, having gun buybacks for the image, people handing their guns in as if that's normal.
[00:17:58.956 --> 00:18:00.357]  We've confirmed the flyer's real.
[00:18:00.417 --> 00:18:01.358]  We've called the phone number.
[00:18:01.919 --> 00:18:03.281]  The FBI admits they put it out.
[00:18:03.501 --> 00:18:06.024]  This is one of the earlier newscasts, so this really happened.
[00:18:06.324 --> 00:18:06.705]  Continue.
[00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:16.716]  Back it up a little.
[00:18:17.076 --> 00:18:25.503]  Remember all the mainstream news stories about man visited by FBI, visited by ATF because he bought 500 rounds of ammo?
[00:18:26.203 --> 00:18:28.265]  Man raided because he bought four guns?
[00:18:28.645 --> 00:18:30.667]  You've seen all those articles last year and this year.
[00:18:31.187 --> 00:18:31.968]  I see them every week.
[00:18:32.688 --> 00:18:33.909]  See, this is what's going on.
[00:18:34.349 --> 00:18:35.409]  Also, knock and talk.
[00:18:35.449 --> 00:18:39.251]  BATF randomly going to houses, knocking, saying, we want to talk about your guns.
[00:18:39.811 --> 00:18:45.113]  There's a giant operation going on to intimidate people into not being part of the Second Amendment liberty culture.
[00:18:45.513 --> 00:18:47.454]  And to create the perception that guns are illegal.
[00:18:47.734 --> 00:18:48.174]  Continue.
[00:18:48.934 --> 00:18:49.574]  Accessories.
[00:18:50.095 --> 00:18:56.017]  Store owners are also supposed to look for people with missing hands or fingers, chemical burns or stains on their clothing.
[00:18:56.385 --> 00:19:03.433]  Generally, this whole thing is a customer, my customer base, probably the customer base of most all your gun shops.
[00:19:03.814 --> 00:19:09.921]  Jim Snow, owner of Rebel Arms and Sporting Goods in Nob Hill, says the form's definition of a terrorist is debatable.
[00:19:10.181 --> 00:19:12.564]  Well, that's generally what a gun owner is.
[00:19:12.604 --> 00:19:15.307]  He's buying a bipod for his rifle.
[00:19:16.508 --> 00:19:18.150]  He's buying handgun ammunition.
[00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:20.892]  He wants a container to keep it safe in.
[00:19:21.093 --> 00:19:27.779]  He says he isn't comfortable using that criteria to profile people in his shop, especially when many are longtime customers.
[00:19:28.079 --> 00:19:31.363]  They're wanting kids to turn their parents in.
[00:19:31.403 --> 00:19:34.245]  They're wanting parents to turn their kids in.
[00:19:34.546 --> 00:19:38.730]  Ron Garrett from GI Guns and Ammo and Rogers doesn't see the point of the flyer.
[00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:41.270]  I think that's probably a little bit of overkill.
[00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:45.931]  He says all potential gun buyers are subject to background checks by the FBI already.
[00:19:46.151 --> 00:19:52.332]  And that form gives us their basic information, their name, address, date of birth, description, and so forth.
[00:19:52.672 --> 00:19:56.993]  And the FBI has the right to deny a sale if the background check doesn't add up.
[00:19:57.553 --> 00:20:03.274]  Even with any regulations, gun store owners we talk with said they'll always be careful about who they sell to.
[00:20:03.794 --> 00:20:05.074]  In Rogers, I'm Kyle Cabot.
[00:20:06.395 --> 00:20:07.695]  So see, it isn't enough.
[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:12.521]  You go through an instant background check when you go to an FFL dealer.
[00:20:13.821 --> 00:20:16.422]  These are rural areas they're targeting mainly with this.
[00:20:18.122 --> 00:20:20.043]  And they're in there saying, are they buying a bipod?
[00:20:20.083 --> 00:20:21.643]  Are they buying a container for ammo?
[00:20:22.523 --> 00:20:23.463]  Are they missing fingers?
[00:20:23.483 --> 00:20:25.904]  You know how many farmers and ranchers are missing fingers?
[00:20:27.324 --> 00:20:31.145]  I mean, you go to some farm meeting and I bet one out of ten people are missing fingers.
[00:20:31.645 --> 00:20:32.426]  Missing arms!
[00:20:33.046 --> 00:20:35.466]  From working on those combines and tractors.
[00:20:36.146 --> 00:20:38.187]  Working with their saws.
[00:20:40.796 --> 00:20:43.437]  You know how many people have burns on their hands at work on farms?
[00:20:46.839 --> 00:20:48.039]  I mean, I've bought bipods.
[00:20:50.681 --> 00:20:51.521]  I've got bipods.
[00:20:51.541 --> 00:20:52.622]  Does that mean I'm a terrorist?
[00:20:53.717 --> 00:20:58.620]  But again, there's also another lie in the piece that the FBI has the right to deny that doesn't add up.
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.881]  No, if it says you're a felon.
[00:21:01.521 --> 00:21:12.587]  But now, outside of the law, they're saying, oh, if you've got a restraining order against you that's standard in a divorce, even if it's not for violence, you have to turn your guns in.
[00:21:13.088 --> 00:21:16.189]  Again, and then we've had court cases where they said that's unconstitutional.
[00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:19.811]  The BATFE, the ATF, they don't stop.
[00:21:20.132 --> 00:21:20.832]  They don't quit.
[00:21:21.652 --> 00:21:22.273]  They never stop.
[00:21:23.237 --> 00:21:25.718]  We're going to talk to Jim Snow for about five minutes coming up.
[00:21:26.099 --> 00:21:27.159]  He's a one-man shop.
[00:21:27.179 --> 00:21:41.287]  They're going to be busy with people in his store, but he can give us five minutes on the other side to tell us specifically what he means about they want us to turn in our parents, turn in our children, because that is in other FBI training flyers that we've covered and broken here on air.
[00:21:42.588 --> 00:21:45.770]  Remember what the MIAC and Homeland Security report says.
[00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:47.451]  Gun owners are the number one enemy of the government.
[00:21:49.432 --> 00:21:50.353]  We're on the march.
[00:21:50.813 --> 00:21:52.314]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:53.332 --> 00:21:56.030]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:05.643]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:22:05.784 --> 00:22:07.024]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:22:07.044 --> 00:22:07.744]  It's very real.
[00:22:07.865 --> 00:22:09.986]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:22:10.106 --> 00:22:11.626]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:22:11.766 --> 00:22:16.089]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[00:22:16.249 --> 00:22:18.610]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:24.593]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[00:22:24.813 --> 00:22:29.534]  Their best seller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[00:22:29.594 --> 00:22:32.335]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[00:22:32.435 --> 00:22:35.056]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[00:22:35.156 --> 00:22:42.318]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[00:22:42.618 --> 00:22:46.339]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling Ecolablue at 1-800-691-6043.
[00:22:46.359 --> 00:22:46.559]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:23:02.842]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:23:03.143 --> 00:23:07.223]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:23:07.483 --> 00:23:12.885]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:23:13.225 --> 00:23:13.705]  It's true.
[00:23:13.985 --> 00:23:18.526]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:23:18.846 --> 00:23:19.387]  Number 3.
[00:23:19.667 --> 00:23:22.949]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:26.992]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:23:27.173 --> 00:23:27.713]  Number 4.
[00:23:27.973 --> 00:23:30.335]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:23:30.735 --> 00:23:34.118]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:23:34.418 --> 00:23:34.618]  Number 5.
[00:23:35.199 --> 00:23:39.122]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:23:39.342 --> 00:23:44.106]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:23:59.056 --> 00:24:01.658]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:24:02.078 --> 00:24:07.021]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:24:07.402 --> 00:24:09.123]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:24:09.443 --> 00:24:14.266]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:24:14.446 --> 00:24:15.407]  How much do you want?
[00:24:15.627 --> 00:24:16.367]  When do you want it?
[00:24:16.748 --> 00:24:18.349]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:24:18.649 --> 00:24:19.470]  When will you need it?
[00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:21.771]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:24:21.911 --> 00:24:23.032]  Will there be any food?
[00:24:23.252 --> 00:24:24.573]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:24:24.773 --> 00:24:29.837]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:24:30.037 --> 00:24:33.260]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:37.123]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:24:37.444 --> 00:24:38.445]  How much will you need?
[00:24:38.685 --> 00:24:39.285]  We don't know.
[00:24:39.565 --> 00:24:40.486]  How much do you want?
[00:24:40.686 --> 00:24:41.407]  All you can get.
[00:24:41.607 --> 00:24:42.428]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:24:42.688 --> 00:24:45.449]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:47.510]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:48.431]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:25:10.996 --> 00:25:13.957]  Rogers, Arkansas.
[00:25:14.098 --> 00:25:21.481]  All over the country.
[00:25:21.681 --> 00:25:25.662]  Tattoo shops, fertilizer shops, regular businesses.
[00:25:25.682 --> 00:25:26.943]  They're giving these flyers.
[00:25:28.032 --> 00:25:34.314]  But the gun shops we've confirmed, we've called the FBI, all over the country are being given these flyers saying, is somebody buying a bipod?
[00:25:34.655 --> 00:25:35.815]  Are they buying a lot of ammo?
[00:25:36.495 --> 00:25:44.338]  And we've seen the news reports all over the country, we've covered them here, where somebody buys 500 rounds of ammo and the ATF visits them.
[00:25:46.843 --> 00:25:48.604]  They come with warrants and search your house.
[00:25:49.184 --> 00:25:51.646]  So they're creating a perception that guns are dirty and bad.
[00:25:51.666 --> 00:25:57.089]  It's like the big billboards that say, report illegal guns, show an image of a revolver, when revolvers aren't illegal.
[00:25:57.369 --> 00:25:58.450]  They're creating this perception.
[00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:00.951]  And Jim Snow is in Rogers, Arkansas.
[00:26:00.991 --> 00:26:02.152]  He owns a gun shop there.
[00:26:02.452 --> 00:26:04.433]  He's running it alone today, so he can't be with us long.
[00:26:04.973 --> 00:26:08.335]  I wanted to get him on specifically about this flyer.
[00:26:08.395 --> 00:26:09.276]  Sir, good to have you with us.
[00:26:10.517 --> 00:26:11.277]  Good to be with you.
[00:26:11.317 --> 00:26:13.338]  Actually, I'm in Springdale, Arkansas.
[00:26:13.358 --> 00:26:14.659]  Okay, well the article says Rogers.
[00:26:14.719 --> 00:26:16.080]  Is Springdale right outside it?
[00:26:16.929 --> 00:26:17.930]  No, no.
[00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:20.432]  Rogers is next town over.
[00:26:20.892 --> 00:26:22.093]  There was two of us on there.
[00:26:23.194 --> 00:26:24.795]  One from Rogers and I'm from Springdale.
[00:26:25.015 --> 00:26:25.295]  Got it.
[00:26:25.335 --> 00:26:27.717]  I was just reading off the headline from a local TV station.
[00:26:28.098 --> 00:26:28.458]  Okay.
[00:26:28.658 --> 00:26:34.202]  Now, when did you get this flyer or other gun shops got it?
[00:26:34.222 --> 00:26:35.924]  The media came and asked you about the flyer.
[00:26:36.144 --> 00:26:37.185]  What do you think about the flyer?
[00:26:38.105 --> 00:26:42.088]  Well, if you read the flyer, it's pretty much
[00:26:44.648 --> 00:26:45.608]  I think we're good to go.
[00:27:09.406 --> 00:27:12.147]  One of those things that they put out that doesn't make a lot of sense.
[00:27:12.167 --> 00:27:12.267]  Right.
[00:27:12.847 --> 00:27:13.687]  That's where this came from.
[00:27:13.707 --> 00:27:16.167]  I'm pretty sure, I don't know that it is, but that's where I think this came from.
[00:27:36.081 --> 00:27:36.761]  Absolutely.
[00:27:36.881 --> 00:27:40.764]  Now, expanding on this, they briefly quote you on television.
[00:27:40.784 --> 00:27:45.966]  Well, they have video of you saying they want kids to report on their parents, parents to report on their kids.
[00:27:45.986 --> 00:27:46.847]  What did you mean by that?
[00:27:47.707 --> 00:27:49.628]  Well, that's what they're trying to get us to do.
[00:27:49.688 --> 00:27:57.393]  They're telling kids in school to tell on their folks for having guns in places where they're not supposed to have them.
[00:27:58.293 --> 00:27:59.093]  Things like that.
[00:27:59.153 --> 00:28:02.735]  They're trying to get parents to turn their kids in because their kids like guns.
[00:28:03.616 --> 00:28:05.497]  It's just reached a point where
[00:28:06.412 --> 00:28:12.339]  Uh, the government doesn't seem to be supporting the American way of life.
[00:28:12.379 --> 00:28:19.468]  They're trying to support some other way of life that doesn't exist here and hasn't existed here ever.
[00:28:21.664 --> 00:28:23.365]  You're absolutely right, sir.
[00:28:23.425 --> 00:28:29.187]  Right here in Austin, they train kids to report on parents' illegal guns, and then the kids think all guns are illegal.
[00:28:29.347 --> 00:28:32.908]  I had a carpet cleaner a decade ago from out of state.
[00:28:33.389 --> 00:28:37.270]  He saw a shotgun on a rack in my house and tried to call the police.
[00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:39.031]  He thought he'd found a terrorist.
[00:28:39.791 --> 00:28:46.635]  And they just shut down the Austin Gun Show because the police said people driving by were scared by people walking in with guns.
[00:28:47.115 --> 00:28:51.857]  I mean, America's come to the point where you can't have guns in your pickup rack.
[00:28:52.738 --> 00:28:57.780]  I mean, they really are creating the perception that guns are like child pornography.
[00:28:59.041 --> 00:29:07.665]  I remember several years ago when I was in high school, we'd take our guns to school on the bus to go home to friends and go hunting.
[00:29:08.226 --> 00:29:08.906]  My father, too.
[00:29:09.747 --> 00:29:11.808]  Yeah, you carry them in your gun rack.
[00:29:11.829 --> 00:29:17.212]  You don't see guns in gun racks anymore in most of any place you go to.
[00:29:17.713 --> 00:29:22.896]  Way back out in the country somewhere maybe you do, but not as a normal rule.
[00:29:23.357 --> 00:29:27.960]  So they have intimidated our movement, our freedom, down to almost nothing.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.361]  Did you hear they shut down the Austin Gun Show?
[00:29:30.702 --> 00:29:31.802]  No law, they just did it.
[00:29:32.783 --> 00:29:33.664]  No, I hadn't heard that.
[00:29:33.704 --> 00:29:36.306]  We had a gun show here in Springdale this weekend.
[00:29:38.601 --> 00:29:39.622]  Nobody shut it down.
[00:29:40.302 --> 00:29:44.085]  Well, you're a federal firearms dealer yourself, because that's what you do as a business.
[00:29:44.105 --> 00:29:44.966]  It's a tax issue.
[00:29:45.246 --> 00:29:50.409]  Here's the ATF Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Unlicensed Person questions.
[00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:53.371]  To whom may an unlicensed person transfer firearms?
[00:29:53.692 --> 00:29:54.973]  We're also on TV right now, sir.
[00:29:55.033 --> 00:29:56.354]  I'm going to put that up on screen.
[00:29:56.574 --> 00:29:58.695]  I want to read this and get your take on it, and then we'll let you go.
[00:29:59.236 --> 00:30:00.557]  To whom it may concern?
[00:30:01.741 --> 00:30:05.965]  To whom may an unlicensed person transfer firearms under the GCA?
[00:30:05.985 --> 00:30:09.929]  And again, we're going to put that ATF document up on screen.
[00:30:10.249 --> 00:30:20.940]  A person may sell a firearm to an unlicensed resident of a state if he does not know or have reasonable cause to believe the person is prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms under federal law.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:30.447]  So again, I can sell my cousin a gun, and my grandfather could give me a gun like he did, just like he'd give me a fishing pole.
[00:30:30.747 --> 00:30:38.554]  But in Austin, the police chief and the ATF say Obama has said no more sales at gun shows from private people, and they just shut it down.
[00:30:38.894 --> 00:30:40.955]  This is a huge national issue.
[00:30:43.918 --> 00:30:45.699]  That's a strange thing.
[00:30:45.779 --> 00:30:47.521]  I hadn't heard of anything like that happening.
[00:30:48.341 --> 00:30:50.483]  I suppose it can if people let it happen.
[00:30:53.424 --> 00:30:55.385]  Well, Mr. Snow, we've got you here today.
[00:30:55.566 --> 00:31:03.231]  I mean, is this upsetting locals that in your schools they're training the kids to spy on the parents and the FBI's got flyers saying if somebody's missing a finger?
[00:31:03.251 --> 00:31:08.535]  I mean, how many... I've been in so many gun shops when veterans come in with arms and legs blown off buying guns.
[00:31:08.575 --> 00:31:10.256]  I guess we're supposed to call the police on them.
[00:31:10.896 --> 00:31:18.321]  Anybody who does any hog hunting or coyote, you know, getting rid of nuisance animals, uses a bipod at night if they know what they're doing.
[00:31:18.642 --> 00:31:20.263]  I mean, I guess that's just all terrorism.
[00:31:21.471 --> 00:31:26.375]  Uh, it seems to be, uh, that's the way our government is trying to, uh, portray us.
[00:31:26.696 --> 00:31:29.258]  Uh, you know, we've got an election year now.
[00:31:29.598 --> 00:31:37.224]  Uh, November we can, uh, go to the polls and, uh, vote out all of those politicians that don't seem to understand the American right.
[00:31:38.125 --> 00:31:40.988]  Uh, the Constitution, the First Amendment or the Second Amendment.
[00:31:41.928 --> 00:31:44.250]  A lot of them don't seem to understand either one of them.
[00:31:45.011 --> 00:31:49.475]  Uh, with the Supreme Court, if you remember a couple of days ago, uh,
[00:31:50.696 --> 00:32:06.226]  Turned down McCain's fine gold law that prohibited corporations from advertising spending money a certain amount of time before a general election.
[00:32:06.967 --> 00:32:08.748]  They found that unconstitutional.
[00:32:08.908 --> 00:32:11.330]  And that was the Republicans passed that.
[00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:16.433]  That's the sad thing is the Patriot Act also is
[00:32:17.348 --> 00:32:18.909]  And Obama is continuing it.
[00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:21.531]  You own Rebel Arms Sporting Goods, sir?
[00:32:21.571 --> 00:32:24.494]  Tell folks how they can visit you there in Arkansas.
[00:32:43.246 --> 00:32:55.060]  Well, we appreciate you speaking out against this demonization, this Soviet-style, Nazi-style demonization of gun owners.
[00:32:55.221 --> 00:32:55.901]  In closing,
[00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:00.081]  A lot of gun dealers are being shut down.
[00:33:00.101 --> 00:33:02.883]  A lot of cities don't even have a gun shop anymore.
[00:33:02.923 --> 00:33:03.603]  They harass them.
[00:33:03.884 --> 00:33:08.106]  If a T isn't crossed and I isn't dotted, they literally harass you out of business.
[00:33:08.567 --> 00:33:11.829]  Have you had any of that go on, or are you aware of that happening in your area?
[00:33:12.989 --> 00:33:14.670]  Nothing that I know of around here.
[00:33:15.591 --> 00:33:18.253]  They treat us pretty good so far.
[00:33:19.474 --> 00:33:21.575]  Nobody that I know of had any problems.
[00:33:21.595 --> 00:33:26.398]  If you do the paperwork right, follow the laws, you shouldn't have any problems.
[00:33:27.168 --> 00:33:37.456]  But again, you as a federal firearms dealer know it's legal in almost every state for somebody to privately, if they've got a few guns, go to a gun show and sell those.
[00:33:38.257 --> 00:33:39.778]  Yes, that's our law.
[00:33:39.838 --> 00:33:44.242]  We can buy, trade and sell our own property the way we want to.
[00:33:46.564 --> 00:33:57.150]  Did you hear about federal regulations where they're saying over 10,000 recalled items, five years in jail, $500,000, the next time a million dollar fine, if you have a garage sale?
[00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:59.291]  I hadn't heard that.
[00:34:00.211 --> 00:34:01.212]  Mainstream media.
[00:34:01.632 --> 00:34:03.613]  They want to shut down private sales.
[00:34:03.973 --> 00:34:06.314]  They want to make you go to a big box Walmart.
[00:34:07.075 --> 00:34:09.696]  Have you read about Walmart making people register to buy ammo?
[00:34:11.377 --> 00:34:12.798]  No, they shouldn't be doing that.
[00:34:13.638 --> 00:34:14.519]  I've never heard that.
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:18.582]  That was in law up until about the mid-70s.
[00:34:18.663 --> 00:34:21.645]  That law was repealed a long time ago.
[00:34:23.246 --> 00:34:25.588]  Well, they're doing it again in Texas and all over the country.
[00:34:27.450 --> 00:34:29.131]  Are your customers upset by this?
[00:34:29.191 --> 00:34:35.416]  That the feds are asking you to report them if they're missing a finger or if they buy a bipod or ammo?
[00:34:36.377 --> 00:34:37.458]  Oh, yeah.
[00:34:37.958 --> 00:34:42.422]  The more they find out about it, the more problems there's going to be with people
[00:34:43.286 --> 00:34:45.967]  I'm not wanting to come in gun shops because of that.
[00:34:47.608 --> 00:34:48.788]  Or if you had R.J.
[00:34:48.888 --> 00:34:52.229]  Civetta, our police chief, he'd just say you're shut down because he's God.
[00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:56.671]  Okay, well, Mr. Snow, I really appreciate you spending time with us.
[00:34:56.911 --> 00:35:00.833]  Jim Snow, joining us from his gun shop in Arkansas.
[00:35:01.173 --> 00:35:03.194]  We appreciate you standing up to these guys.
[00:35:03.434 --> 00:35:06.815]  So, you're not going to report people buying ammo at the gun shop?
[00:35:08.096 --> 00:35:08.376]  No.
[00:35:08.476 --> 00:35:09.336]  Why would I do that?
[00:35:09.356 --> 00:35:10.717]  It's not against the law.
[00:35:10.737 --> 00:35:11.757]  They can buy what they want.
[00:35:13.666 --> 00:35:22.032]  The problem is a lot of gun shops are doing this, and I don't know if you've seen the news where people that buy a bunch of ammo, over 500 rounds, which isn't that much, get a police visit.
[00:35:22.072 --> 00:35:25.595]  Have you heard of knock and talk, where they come to your door and just want to talk about your guns with you?
[00:35:26.335 --> 00:35:28.297]  No, no, not in the United States.
[00:35:28.417 --> 00:35:33.100]  Maybe when you get out to foreign countries like California and New York or something.
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:33.580]  No, sir.
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.562]  Knock and talk is going on everywhere.
[00:35:38.104 --> 00:35:39.204]  Foreign countries like California.
[00:35:39.244 --> 00:35:39.785]  I get the joke.
[00:35:40.529 --> 00:35:40.769]  Yeah.
[00:35:41.549 --> 00:35:42.589]  It's not really a joke, though.
[00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:44.470]  Now, a knockin' talk's goin' on in Dallas.
[00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:45.810]  Goin' on in the wealthy areas.
[00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:46.890]  Hmm.
[00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:47.671]  Hadn't heard that.
[00:35:48.191 --> 00:35:49.071]  Absolutely, sir.
[00:35:49.251 --> 00:35:58.153]  Well, God bless you, and we need to get the gun community... I mean, obviously, you've probably seen record sales the last year, because people are figuring out they're coming after our Second Amendment.
[00:35:58.913 --> 00:36:02.714]  Yeah, that's been... about every gun shop I know of has had record sales.
[00:36:03.974 --> 00:36:04.354]  All right.
[00:36:04.474 --> 00:36:05.174]  Well, God bless you.
[00:36:05.194 --> 00:36:06.335]  They're not gonna stop freedom.
[00:36:06.815 --> 00:36:07.895]  Thanks to people like you, sir.
[00:36:07.935 --> 00:36:08.255]  Take care.
[00:36:09.022 --> 00:36:09.783]  Thanks for letting me on.
[00:36:09.923 --> 00:36:10.063]  Bye.
[00:36:10.243 --> 00:36:10.523]  You bet.
[00:36:10.564 --> 00:36:11.164]  Thank you, Jim.
[00:36:12.525 --> 00:36:14.247]  Okay, now here is the ATF.
[00:36:14.267 --> 00:36:16.269]  This is from the stinking federal government.
[00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:18.271]  This is from the whiskey regulators.
[00:36:18.731 --> 00:36:20.133]  The worst federal goons ever known.
[00:36:20.173 --> 00:36:22.535]  This is the worst federal agency, the first federal agency.
[00:36:23.176 --> 00:36:28.841]  They'd go out and take people out that own their own land that happened to have gold on it or water.
[00:36:29.102 --> 00:36:31.204]  I mean, the ATF are known as the regulators.
[00:36:33.595 --> 00:36:38.498]  You see a Clint Eastwood movie where the train pulls up and 20 guys get off in black suits and start killing people?
[00:36:39.018 --> 00:36:42.020]  There are literally thousands of famous cases of that.
[00:36:43.821 --> 00:36:44.861]  Into the 1930s.
[00:36:45.201 --> 00:36:47.563]  And the ATF is always the stormtroopers that lead them.
[00:36:48.243 --> 00:36:49.744]  Now, here's from the stormtroopers.
[00:36:50.664 --> 00:36:53.046]  ATF Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives.
[00:36:53.486 --> 00:36:55.607]  Bring up unlicensed person questions.
[00:36:55.647 --> 00:36:58.729]  To whom may an unlicensed person transfer firearms under the GCA?
[00:36:59.549 --> 00:37:00.470]  The Gun Control Act.
[00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:02.231]  Now, let's turn to Q.
[00:37:03.544 --> 00:37:05.105]  There's Q on your screen.
[00:37:05.906 --> 00:37:12.570]  I think everybody ought to fax this to Arne Seveda and to KI and everybody else out there and show them the stinking law.
[00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:16.933]  They are hoaxing everyone saying it's the law that you can't privately sell guns.
[00:37:18.654 --> 00:37:25.058]  A person may sell a firearm to an unlicensed resident of his state if he does not know or have reasonable cause to believe.
[00:37:25.078 --> 00:37:26.899]  You don't have any responsibility.
[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:28.901]  It's only if you know.
[00:37:30.185 --> 00:37:30.885]  Let me read the whole thing.
[00:37:30.905 --> 00:37:33.526]  To whom may an unlicensed person transfer firearms under the GCA?
[00:37:33.927 --> 00:37:42.550]  A person may sell a firearm to an unlicensed resident of his state if he does not know or have reasonable cause to believe the person is prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms under federal law.
[00:37:43.251 --> 00:37:48.693]  Any person may loan or rent a firearm to a resident of any state for temporary use for lawful sporting purposes.
[00:37:49.634 --> 00:37:53.875]  If he does not know or have reasonable cause to believe the person is prohibited under receiving or possessing firearms.
[00:37:54.176 --> 00:37:58.417]  See, but they want to make it like England did 30 years ago where you've got to register to get a gun.
[00:37:58.437 --> 00:37:59.418]  Then they just ban it.
[00:38:00.461 --> 00:38:06.846]  Now, that's the ATF, but KI and the Austin Police Department think you are so stupid.
[00:38:08.507 --> 00:38:12.890]  And CNN, I'm told, I haven't seen it yet, has now reported on this, but I'm told they reported the same thing.
[00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:14.811]  People are upset in Texas.
[00:38:14.871 --> 00:38:17.953]  You can't sell guns without a license or a background check.
[00:38:17.973 --> 00:38:18.814]  What's the big deal?
[00:38:19.654 --> 00:38:27.300]  See, just like the carpet cleaner started calling the police on me because he saw a shotgun up on a gun rack ten years ago.
[00:38:30.626 --> 00:38:31.427]  This is America.
[00:38:32.828 --> 00:38:33.788]  They think they're illegal.
[00:38:33.828 --> 00:38:37.611]  People drive by the Saxon Gun and Knife Show, they got shut down, they would call 911.
[00:38:38.252 --> 00:38:39.953]  My God, there's a slave with a gun!
[00:38:41.735 --> 00:38:47.816]  The average person that's an effeminate slave sees cops and SWAT teams in black masks breaking women's legs and arms.
[00:38:48.016 --> 00:38:49.477]  Put up the photo of the woman's leg broken.
[00:38:49.517 --> 00:38:50.157]  Peaceful protester.
[00:38:50.177 --> 00:38:50.797]  We're getting her on.
[00:38:51.137 --> 00:38:56.078]  And they just go, oh, I feel so safe when the government's breaking women's legs and tasering people half to death.
[00:38:56.378 --> 00:38:57.259]  God, I feel good.
[00:38:57.539 --> 00:38:58.699]  But then they see a citizen with a gun.
[00:38:58.719 --> 00:39:01.820]  They're like, oh, please, no, no.
[00:39:04.701 --> 00:39:08.204]  But they see citizens being brutalized, and they go, oh, that makes me feel safe.
[00:39:08.644 --> 00:39:09.425]  I love government.
[00:39:09.445 --> 00:39:11.827]  It didn't kill 200 million people in the 20th century.
[00:39:12.727 --> 00:39:14.148]  Government doesn't become corrupt.
[00:39:14.709 --> 00:39:15.429]  Oh, yes, it does.
[00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:21.654]  And I have this video out of Pittsburgh, and this keeps happening, where they shoot people a lot of the time.
[00:39:22.255 --> 00:39:25.417]  Off-duty, not off-duty, plainclothes detectives jump out of cars.
[00:39:25.457 --> 00:39:26.018]  They stop.
[00:39:26.438 --> 00:39:27.539]  The guy had a bottle of Mountain Dew.
[00:39:27.559 --> 00:39:28.340]  They thought it was a weapon.
[00:39:29.264 --> 00:39:32.845]  He gets scared, and it's on the video, they're not yelling police until they're beating him.
[00:39:33.245 --> 00:39:43.369]  He tries to run, he trips, and like wolves on a prey, they get him, beat him, taser him in the head, rip his skin off, and then they charge him with assaulting them when it's on video, he didn't touch them.
[00:39:45.754 --> 00:39:46.754]  It's mental illness.
[00:39:46.834 --> 00:39:48.315]  They don't think of us as humans.
[00:39:49.075 --> 00:39:50.016]  It's psychopathic.
[00:39:50.036 --> 00:39:52.617]  They think of us as complete and total slaves.
[00:39:53.517 --> 00:39:55.478]  They think of us as not even being real.
[00:39:55.938 --> 00:39:59.979]  And if they break our leg, or taser us, or kill us, or whatever, it's alright.
[00:39:59.999 --> 00:40:02.640]  Because, you know, they're doing a good job and some eggs are going to get broken.
[00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:05.281]  They shoot your kid in the back because they're not trained.
[00:40:05.681 --> 00:40:07.622]  They're hiring a bunch of cowardly, weak people, too.
[00:40:07.642 --> 00:40:09.143]  Have you noticed a lot of the cops they hire now?
[00:40:09.383 --> 00:40:11.283]  Cops have always had problems and had corruption.
[00:40:11.323 --> 00:40:12.284]  That's just the nature of it.
[00:40:12.904 --> 00:40:16.248]  But more and more all over the country they're like these little social workers.
[00:40:17.249 --> 00:40:22.816]  And they're just like the people we're about to play video of here in just a moment.
[00:40:24.518 --> 00:40:29.464]  Mark Dice goes out and
[00:40:31.883 --> 00:40:39.091]  He goes on the streets of San Diego, and we talked to him this morning, he's coming on later in the week, and he said, no, this is in the order it happened, this is the people.
[00:40:39.611 --> 00:40:45.217]  He found two people that wouldn't sign a petition to ban free speech in America, everybody else would.
[00:40:46.879 --> 00:40:47.860]  Everybody else would.
[00:40:49.249 --> 00:40:52.452]  And he did just a great job, really impressed with what he's done.
[00:40:52.492 --> 00:40:57.055]  The full video is up on PrisonPlanet.com if you want to go watch it.
[00:40:58.036 --> 00:41:01.019]  But we're going to play the video and I'm going to break it down in this segment and the next.
[00:41:01.059 --> 00:41:04.722]  Then Mike Adams on the flu hoax falling apart is coming up.
[00:41:05.102 --> 00:41:14.470]  I want to briefly again invite listeners to not procrastinate in the info war and realize that the enemy's propaganda has to be reapplied over and over again.
[00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:17.090]  Because they're lying, they're deceiving, they're twisting.
[00:41:17.451 --> 00:41:23.732]  But you show somebody how they've been lied to once, or twice, or three or four times, most people will wake up.
[00:41:23.812 --> 00:41:29.213]  And most people have already woken up that something's wrong, they just don't know the full import of what they're dealing with.
[00:41:29.954 --> 00:41:36.295]  And so what I want to encourage people to do is give people the films that have been the most successful at waking people up, period.
[00:41:36.735 --> 00:41:38.336]  Loose Change Final Cut, available.

[00:42:59.384 --> 00:43:00.645]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:43:00.685 --> 00:43:06.028]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:43:06.268 --> 00:43:10.890]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:11.671]  It's true.
[00:43:11.771 --> 00:43:14.352]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[00:43:14.572 --> 00:43:16.313]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:43:16.855 --> 00:43:21.538]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:43:22.079 --> 00:43:24.000]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.

[00:45:44.779 --> 00:45:46.400]  Isn't that what you want for your family?
[00:45:46.621 --> 00:45:50.544]  Visit freezedryguy.com or call 866-404-FOOD.
[00:45:50.724 --> 00:45:55.868]  That's 866-404-3663 or go to freezedryguy.com.
[00:45:56.008 --> 00:45:57.109]  Freeze Dry Guy.
[00:45:57.209 --> 00:45:58.510]  The best you can buy.
[00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:01.612]  Well, the flu hoax imploded.
[00:46:10.728 --> 00:46:13.109]  In an even more spectacular way than I even thought it would.
[00:46:13.129 --> 00:46:14.449]  Great job everybody.
[00:46:14.469 --> 00:46:19.511]  Mike Adams coming up at the 5 after break when we start the second segment of the next hour.
[00:46:19.531 --> 00:46:24.573]  Alright, but in this segment, the short next segment, I want to play Mark Dice.
[00:46:24.593 --> 00:46:28.394]  We're going to cover this more on Thursday when he joins us live on the radio.
[00:46:29.795 --> 00:46:39.578]  He went out, this is the order he talked to people, and only two people out of scores he talked to were against banning free speech in the Second Amendment.
[00:46:41.277 --> 00:46:46.919]  Now, remember, more than half the public will ban your guns, will ban the Second Amendment.
[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:49.320]  They are completely dumbed down.
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:51.321]  Look at these people in Southern California.
[00:46:51.381 --> 00:46:52.762]  These are not Americans.
[00:46:53.302 --> 00:46:54.743]  Look at how nasty they are.
[00:46:55.183 --> 00:46:56.683]  Look at how much they hate freedom.
[00:46:57.464 --> 00:46:59.785]  Let's go ahead and go to Mark Dice.
[00:47:00.525 --> 00:47:05.067]  And the majority of the people he talked to said ban free speech when he even told them.
[00:47:05.987 --> 00:47:07.868]  And bring in a new world order, world government.
[00:47:07.888 --> 00:47:08.829]  That's what the petition said.
[00:47:08.849 --> 00:47:09.769]  They said, yes, we want it.
[00:47:10.606 --> 00:47:11.006]  Here we go.
[00:47:11.607 --> 00:47:17.592]  I'm Mark Dice, and this is a petition to repeal the First Amendment to the Constitution.
[00:47:17.952 --> 00:47:22.836]  You may be saying that nobody's going to sign this, but I would be willing to bet differently.
[00:47:22.856 --> 00:47:24.097]  Mission, please?
[00:47:25.138 --> 00:47:26.920]  What is it for?
[00:47:28.201 --> 00:47:31.584]  It's to repeal the First Amendment and the New World Order.
[00:47:32.845 --> 00:47:33.786]  Stop hate speech.
[00:47:33.986 --> 00:47:38.550]  You know, we want to really just kind of re... We're going to look at that issue again,
[00:47:39.992 --> 00:47:43.355]  Yeah, I mean, people are disagreeing with the President.
[00:47:43.475 --> 00:47:45.196]  I mean, I'm gonna stop that.
[00:47:45.216 --> 00:47:45.777]  Thanks.
[00:47:48.939 --> 00:47:53.523]  Hey, can you sign our petition quick?
[00:47:54.404 --> 00:47:56.065]  To stop hate speech.
[00:47:56.926 --> 00:47:57.486]  Hate speech?
[00:47:57.586 --> 00:47:58.667]  Stop the hate speech.
[00:47:59.748 --> 00:48:04.152]  Get these people to stop, you know, saying mean things and disrespectful.
[00:48:04.592 --> 00:48:04.952]  Yes.
[00:48:05.073 --> 00:48:06.414]  Disrespectful things.
[00:48:09.364 --> 00:48:17.251]  And start with, you know, repealing the First Amendment and just kind of re-looking at that again.
[00:48:17.271 --> 00:48:21.674]  You know, we really need that in the New World Order, in today's society.
[00:48:22.335 --> 00:48:22.635]  You know?
[00:48:22.895 --> 00:48:24.337]  I agree with you on that.
[00:48:24.357 --> 00:48:25.758]  Can we just quick sign our petition?
[00:48:26.727 --> 00:48:29.648]  We're trying to repeal the First Amendment to the Constitution.
[00:48:31.948 --> 00:48:33.209]  It's part of the New World Order.
[00:48:33.529 --> 00:48:42.471]  People are abusing things and saying really mean things about the President and his hate speech.
[00:48:42.631 --> 00:48:43.651]  So this will stop that.
[00:48:43.671 --> 00:48:50.033]  Actually, I'd feel more comfortable if I went on and researched it online a little bit more.
[00:48:50.899 --> 00:48:54.201]  Well, we're citizens against the First Amendment, catfa.org.
[00:48:54.221 --> 00:48:55.182]  Okay.
[00:48:55.202 --> 00:48:58.504]  I'm going to look on catfa.org.
[00:48:58.644 --> 00:48:59.044]  Okay.
[00:48:59.144 --> 00:49:02.547]  What would make you feel comfortable signing it?
[00:49:02.707 --> 00:49:06.930]  Just sitting down and looking at more information that's available online.
[00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:15.355]  Are you familiar with the evils of the First Amendment and how horrible it is and how outdated such an idea is?
[00:49:15.375 --> 00:49:19.098]  Well, that's why I'd feel more comfortable just looking online and kind of researching it myself.
[00:49:19.138 --> 00:49:19.478]  Okay.
[00:49:20.499 --> 00:49:22.001]  We won't spam you or anything.
[00:49:22.021 --> 00:49:22.522]  Oh, I know.
[00:49:22.802 --> 00:49:23.062]  I know.
[00:49:23.403 --> 00:49:26.567]  But I like to make sure I know exactly what I'm signing.
[00:49:26.627 --> 00:49:30.191]  Just like, you know, just makes me feel comfortable knowing.
[00:49:30.451 --> 00:49:31.252]  Just to make sure.
[00:49:31.272 --> 00:49:33.014]  So I'm not just signing it.
[00:49:33.054 --> 00:49:35.557]  You know, like I want to sign things that I believe in as well.
[00:49:35.758 --> 00:49:38.621]  So you'll know why we need to get rid of the First Amendment.
[00:49:38.701 --> 00:49:39.142]  Exactly.
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:40.660]  Okay.
[00:49:41.081 --> 00:49:41.981]  Alright, that makes sense.
[00:49:42.942 --> 00:49:43.222]  Thanks.
[00:49:43.842 --> 00:49:45.523]  We just want to stop the hate speech.
[00:49:46.344 --> 00:49:51.127]  This would be just a quick, quick thing to stop the, you know, the hateful things.
[00:49:51.147 --> 00:50:04.795]  We'll have to legislate, you know, the things that people say that they disagree with, you know, against the government and the Bilderberg Group and just a signature and a birthdate will be fine.
[00:50:04.855 --> 00:50:05.536]  No phone number.
[00:50:11.286 --> 00:50:12.267]  Sounds like a good thing.
[00:50:12.367 --> 00:50:19.110]  You know, I mean, in today's new world order, we don't need these idiots, you know, disagreeing with the president.
[00:50:20.151 --> 00:50:21.972]  Oh, you gotta sign it, too.
[00:50:22.132 --> 00:50:23.953]  I don't disagree.
[00:50:24.033 --> 00:50:25.333]  So you read this?
[00:50:25.373 --> 00:50:26.254]  You're okay with that?
[00:50:26.274 --> 00:50:26.814]  I'm okay, yeah.
[00:50:26.834 --> 00:50:27.014]  Okay.
[00:50:27.154 --> 00:50:28.235]  Alright, thanks.
[00:50:28.255 --> 00:50:28.915]  Alright, hit pause.
[00:50:29.976 --> 00:50:34.418]  Because he disagrees with people who don't like Obama, he wants to ban their free speech.
[00:50:35.239 --> 00:50:36.359]  Do you understand?
[00:50:36.599 --> 00:50:37.640]  They're coming for us.

[00:51:51.911 --> 00:51:53.832]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:54.292 --> 00:51:56.974]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:52:03.610 --> 00:52:07.771]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:52:08.432 --> 00:52:09.252]  You want answers?
[00:52:10.032 --> 00:52:10.932]  Well, so does he.
[00:52:10.952 --> 00:52:15.194]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:15.754 --> 00:52:19.875]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:52:21.796 --> 00:52:28.498]  Finishing up the Mark Dice video, the vast majority, he put a couple people in there who
[00:52:30.515 --> 00:52:45.982]  Wouldn't sign the petition, but he had many, many more who were against the First Amendment that he didn't even have time to put in the YouTube video because it was only going to be 10 minutes long.
[00:52:46.403 --> 00:52:48.784]  So imagine, we have people
[00:52:50.458 --> 00:52:53.260]  Who want to repeal the Second Amendment, want to repeal the First Amendment.
[00:52:53.560 --> 00:53:00.584]  I guarantee you, Dice could go out, I could go out and get, not in Texas, but in California, the majority to say, yes, disarm me.
[00:53:00.724 --> 00:53:01.684]  I want to be a slave.
[00:53:02.024 --> 00:53:06.707]  But that last guy, he said, we want to ban people having free speech and criticizing Obama in any way.
[00:53:06.727 --> 00:53:07.748]  And he said, I agree with that.
[00:53:08.188 --> 00:53:09.168]  I agree, but we need to ban them.
[00:53:09.769 --> 00:53:10.109]  Signed.
[00:53:10.549 --> 00:53:12.550]  I mean, just, I love tyranny.
[00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:13.491]  Let's go back to it.
[00:53:15.429 --> 00:53:16.650]  Repeal the First Amendment.
[00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:19.433]  Stop hate speech and negative speech.
[00:53:19.473 --> 00:53:20.674]  Just a signature would be good.
[00:53:21.254 --> 00:53:22.235]  What is it for?
[00:53:22.355 --> 00:53:23.196]  What's hate speech?
[00:53:23.216 --> 00:53:25.197]  Well, it's hate speech.
[00:53:25.218 --> 00:53:26.839]  When you say hateful and mean things.
[00:53:27.379 --> 00:53:29.161]  Look at CAFTA.
[00:53:29.181 --> 00:53:29.581]  CAFTA.org.
[00:53:29.601 --> 00:53:34.125]  It's just to support the repeal of the First Amendment.
[00:53:36.247 --> 00:53:36.807]  Beautiful day.
[00:53:38.268 --> 00:53:38.429]  Hi.
[00:53:38.469 --> 00:53:39.650]  Say hi.
[00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:41.091]  Signature.
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:50.485]  You know, I mean, in today's society, we don't need... I mean, who are the people to say that they don't agree with the president anymore, you know?
[00:53:51.506 --> 00:53:52.727]  And he knows what's best.
[00:53:53.087 --> 00:53:53.628]  Hit pause.
[00:53:54.605 --> 00:53:56.206]  By the way, this video is not edited.
[00:53:56.646 --> 00:53:57.926]  They had a wireless mic.
[00:53:57.966 --> 00:53:59.467]  The camera is about 50 yards away.
[00:53:59.527 --> 00:54:00.528]  This is hidden video.
[00:54:00.988 --> 00:54:04.689]  So that's what you're hearing when a car drives by or somebody walks by.
[00:54:04.749 --> 00:54:09.371]  You hear it cut out because they were right within the range of that wireless mic.
[00:54:09.412 --> 00:54:12.933]  We've got a bunch of them and they don't work over 50, 60 feet most of the time.
[00:54:13.453 --> 00:54:14.414]  So that's what's happening there.
[00:54:14.454 --> 00:54:14.794]  Continue.
[00:54:17.987 --> 00:54:22.891]  So we figured, best thing, 200-year-old legislation needs to be revised.
[00:54:23.751 --> 00:54:24.031]  You know?
[00:54:24.832 --> 00:54:25.112]  Thanks.
[00:54:27.594 --> 00:54:29.956]  You know, in the New World Order, we don't need that kind of stuff.
[00:54:30.516 --> 00:54:31.177]  Hit pause again.
[00:54:32.489 --> 00:54:37.450]  I'm going to have to play more of this later, but notice those happy women with their kids enjoying a beautiful day.
[00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:39.410]  They think the world's a wonderland for them.
[00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:40.771]  The government loves them.
[00:54:40.791 --> 00:54:44.391]  The government's their big mommy, their big nanny, their big daddy.
[00:54:45.092 --> 00:54:47.052]  And he's like, we're going to take their speech away.
[00:54:47.072 --> 00:54:48.072]  They're being mean.
[00:54:48.092 --> 00:54:49.953]  And she says, I'm good.
[00:54:49.973 --> 00:54:51.033]  I want to sign.
[00:54:51.393 --> 00:54:52.833]  Let's take their speech away.
[00:54:53.393 --> 00:54:54.373]  That's America.
[00:54:54.614 --> 00:54:56.214]  We're going to all be friendly now.
[00:54:57.114 --> 00:55:04.066]  And a female member of Congress, I have that video coming up later, she said if we could just get all the men kicked out of Congress, we'd be able to pass this.
[00:55:05.143 --> 00:55:06.864]  See, we're going to have a big mommy state.
[00:55:06.884 --> 00:55:08.825]  You're going to go to jail if you don't have the health care.
[00:55:08.845 --> 00:55:12.427]  And if we don't like how you're raising your kids, you yell at them, the state's going to take them.
[00:55:13.027 --> 00:55:16.189]  Doesn't matter if the state is five times more likely to hurt kids than anybody.
[00:55:16.729 --> 00:55:18.891]  We don't need R. Day Cerveda.
[00:55:18.931 --> 00:55:21.372]  We don't need people selling guns privately in Austin.
[00:55:21.912 --> 00:55:23.433]  He says the feds say ban it.
[00:55:23.493 --> 00:55:24.514]  I'm going to ban it.
[00:55:25.334 --> 00:55:26.975]  Hey, you don't get a second amendment.
[00:55:27.375 --> 00:55:28.736]  You don't get a first amendment.
[00:55:28.776 --> 00:55:29.516]  I'm sorry.
[00:55:30.157 --> 00:55:31.578]  You're not going to be mean anymore.
[00:55:32.768 --> 00:55:37.333]  Arne Seveda has created a new unit threatening to arrest people that criticize him on the internet.
[00:55:37.934 --> 00:55:41.497]  And he says, well, if they do it with anonymity, we're going after you.
[00:55:41.537 --> 00:55:43.119]  Because that's freedom!
[00:55:43.199 --> 00:55:46.382]  You don't talk... And that's where he's from, California.
[00:55:46.422 --> 00:55:47.564]  Well, formerly Cuba.
[00:55:48.164 --> 00:55:54.030]  I mean, he says he doesn't like Fidel Castro, but I think a little too much of that rubbed off on him as a kid growing up under Castro.
[00:55:54.622 --> 00:55:57.904]  I mean, seriously, why don't we have a police chief who's from Austin?
[00:55:58.484 --> 00:55:59.945]  And I want Artie Cerveda to come in here.
[00:56:00.345 --> 00:56:01.566]  Gloves are off in the interview.
[00:56:01.606 --> 00:56:02.006]  We'll see.
[00:56:02.526 --> 00:56:09.490]  He came in here and tried to co-opt us and glad hand us, but the blood without warrants and the gun grabbing, you know, Artie Cerveda, give me a break.
[00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:12.551]  Of course, maybe Art will stick his boys on him.
[00:56:12.571 --> 00:56:14.312]  Maybe they can find something on me, huh?
[00:56:14.612 --> 00:56:16.674]  That's what Fidel would do, huh, Artie Cerveda?
[00:56:17.214 --> 00:56:18.014]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:56:18.054 --> 00:56:19.675]  I'm not doing this on the internet with anonymity.
[00:56:20.676 --> 00:56:21.276]  I'm right here.
[00:56:22.236 --> 00:56:22.917]  I'm an American.
[00:56:24.428 --> 00:56:25.089]  You understand that?
[00:56:26.109 --> 00:56:29.613]  We welcome people from other countries if they come here and respect our nation.
[00:56:30.073 --> 00:56:34.937]  But we know they've imported millions of foreigners, over 30 million illegals, to slit this country's throat.
[00:56:35.137 --> 00:56:37.139]  And we're done playing games!
[00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:38.380]  We're head up!
[00:56:39.061 --> 00:56:39.862]  We're not stopping!
[00:56:40.662 --> 00:56:41.343]  We're serious!
[00:56:41.823 --> 00:56:42.464]  We're focused!
[00:56:43.144 --> 00:56:43.885]  We're America!
[00:56:44.165 --> 00:56:44.826]  We're 1776!
[00:56:46.007 --> 00:56:47.748]  We are the patriots!
[00:56:48.109 --> 00:56:49.750]  We are the good guys!
[00:56:50.411 --> 00:56:51.492]  You are the bad guys!
[00:56:58.851 --> 00:57:03.094]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:57:03.414 --> 00:57:04.035]  Number one.
[00:57:04.315 --> 00:57:07.477]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:57:07.737 --> 00:57:08.318]  Number two.
[00:57:08.598 --> 00:57:13.161]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:57:13.501 --> 00:57:13.941]  It's true.
[00:57:14.242 --> 00:57:18.785]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:57:19.105 --> 00:57:19.645]  Number 3.
[00:57:19.926 --> 00:57:23.208]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:57:23.508 --> 00:57:27.250]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:57:27.431 --> 00:57:27.691]  Number 4.
[00:57:28.231 --> 00:57:30.593]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:57:30.993 --> 00:57:34.375]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:57:34.675 --> 00:57:34.876]  Number 5.
[00:57:35.456 --> 00:57:39.379]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:57:39.599 --> 00:57:44.362]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:57:44.642 --> 00:57:48.686]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:57:48.826 --> 00:57:50.388]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:57:50.608 --> 00:57:52.710]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:55.213]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:58:00.558 --> 00:58:04.199]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:58:04.519 --> 00:58:12.660]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:17.441]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:58:18.021 --> 00:58:28.843]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:58:29.463 --> 00:58:38.466]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:58:38.966 --> 00:58:44.028]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:58:44.408 --> 00:58:51.591]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:58:51.891 --> 00:58:54.632]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:58:59.818 --> 00:59:03.481]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:59:03.842 --> 00:59:06.844]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:59:07.084 --> 00:59:11.868]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:59:11.888 --> 00:59:18.134]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:59:18.274 --> 00:59:20.516]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:59:21.036 --> 00:59:22.617]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:59:22.657 --> 00:59:23.798]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:59:23.818 --> 00:59:26.060]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:59:39.949 --> 00:59:41.770]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:59:42.070 --> 00:59:46.891]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:59:47.212 --> 00:59:57.135]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:59.596 --> 01:00:05.138]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:07.028 --> 01:00:08.389]  Back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:08.449 --> 01:00:09.789]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:12.931]  We've got an hour and 52 minutes left in transmission.
[01:00:13.411 --> 01:00:23.556]  Massive news blitz on scores of key stories that I mentioned a bit in the first hour coming up in the fourth and final hour today.
[01:00:24.176 --> 01:00:27.218]  Vital information on the government takeover of health care sinking.
[01:00:28.418 --> 01:00:31.340]  Vital information on the global warming fraud.
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:33.722]  A plan to found world government.
[01:00:34.522 --> 01:00:37.344]  Stuff that dwarfs ClimateGate coming out every hour.
[01:00:37.444 --> 01:00:38.885]  I mean, total fraud.
[01:00:39.025 --> 01:00:40.927]  All the universities, the UN admitting it.
[01:00:41.247 --> 01:00:47.251]  They are just imploding and burning and exploding in front of us if we force the issue and continue driving.
[01:00:48.758 --> 01:00:50.299]  Their flu hoax has imploded.
[01:00:50.959 --> 01:01:01.365]  The fact that the bank stole the trillions of dollars and didn't use it to help homeowners, as they said, and that they gave it to themselves, and that they engineered the fraud, as even in McClatchy newspapers.
[01:01:02.386 --> 01:01:07.809]  This week, Treasury Secretary Geithner and Fed Chairman Bernanke are going to be grilled.
[01:01:07.849 --> 01:01:09.670]  There's discussion of criminal charges.
[01:01:10.732 --> 01:01:14.597]  Ladies and gentlemen, criminals always go too far.
[01:01:14.858 --> 01:01:20.365]  And they may have half the population who wants to ban the First Amendment openly and ban the second.
[01:01:21.066 --> 01:01:21.747]  It doesn't matter.
[01:01:22.067 --> 01:01:24.951]  Even 99% say, I'm a slave, I'm still free.
[01:01:25.712 --> 01:01:27.093]  I have a right to defend myself.
[01:01:27.333 --> 01:01:30.716]  Hitler may have said he was God in Germany and could kill whoever he wanted.
[01:01:30.896 --> 01:01:31.617]  That was a fraud.
[01:01:31.637 --> 01:01:32.317]  He was a tyrant.
[01:01:32.718 --> 01:01:34.079]  Julius Caesar was a tyrant.
[01:01:34.499 --> 01:01:36.341]  But we don't have tyrant leaders today.
[01:01:36.561 --> 01:01:37.882]  They're just tyrant puppets.
[01:01:38.322 --> 01:01:42.486]  It's the global corporate crime syndicate coming in and taking over our society.
[01:01:42.506 --> 01:01:46.489]  Now, the flu hoax has imploded.
[01:01:48.911 --> 01:01:52.714]  On paper, in the courts, in the foreign news, but not a lot in our news.
[01:01:52.734 --> 01:01:54.916]  They're still running the ads to get your flu shot.
[01:01:56.189 --> 01:02:02.555]  Roughly 11% of people have died from this flu that regularly would die from the regular seasonal flu.
[01:02:03.115 --> 01:02:04.516]  And that's probably an inflated number.
[01:02:04.957 --> 01:02:13.324]  It's come out that most people they claim died had heart failure, kidney problems, were already very sick, drug addicts, HIV, had compromised immune systems.
[01:02:14.245 --> 01:02:18.068]  It was a non-event, clearly an engineered virus, top scientist on record saying that.
[01:02:18.982 --> 01:02:24.708]  Big companies were caught with bird flu that was also killing around 30% of people that took it.
[01:02:24.728 --> 01:02:25.709]  That's London Telegraph.
[01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:28.632]  That's now in the European Union investigation.
[01:02:28.652 --> 01:02:33.197]  Looks like we're going to have members of that commission on this week.
[01:02:33.277 --> 01:02:34.499]  We're working on that right now.
[01:02:34.559 --> 01:02:35.280]  Very, very close.
[01:02:37.031 --> 01:02:39.914]  You cannot overstate how big this is.
[01:02:39.954 --> 01:02:42.076]  And they're saying the vaccine's dangerous.
[01:02:42.717 --> 01:02:43.698]  The vaccine's bad.
[01:02:43.838 --> 01:02:44.799]  It didn't help people.
[01:02:44.899 --> 01:02:45.580]  It hurt people.
[01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:46.561]  It was a fraud.
[01:02:46.601 --> 01:02:48.523]  It's now coming out that of the U.S.
[01:02:48.583 --> 01:02:57.391]  advisers, just like Obama's advisers on government takeover of healthcare, turned out basically all of them are getting half a million, quarter million dollars from the White House, covertly.
[01:02:58.312 --> 01:03:06.197]  It's coming out all these flu experts were, had worked, or were working, or had stock, or making money, or were consultants, in some cases making millions a year.
[01:03:06.797 --> 01:03:09.839]  These government officials that push the flu hype.
[01:03:11.001 --> 01:03:25.267]  To get the hype really going, in January of last year, three months before it even raised its ugly head, we had emergency managers on, we had internal documents from the Bureau of Cemeteries in New York, where they were telling police, get ready for millions dead.
[01:03:25.608 --> 01:03:28.189]  They were telling doctors, before it ever even showed up in Mexico.
[01:03:28.809 --> 01:03:31.750]  So they were pre-hyping for total fear so people would buy into it.
[01:03:32.071 --> 01:03:35.892]  The good news is they've never had a flu vaccine fail like this.
[01:03:35.952 --> 01:03:37.533]  The majority of people are not taking it.
[01:03:37.833 --> 01:03:38.914]  It's rotting on shelves.
[01:03:38.954 --> 01:03:40.174]  It's a huge controversy.
[01:03:40.414 --> 01:03:46.137]  So to walk through this is Mike Adams of naturalnews.com.
[01:03:46.317 --> 01:03:49.578]  Really the leader in amazing research journalism.
[01:03:49.618 --> 01:03:51.799]  He was there day one exposing this with us.
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:57.122]  H1N1 swine flu hoax falls apart at the seams and he walks through it.
[01:03:58.041 --> 01:03:59.702]  Thank you Alex for inviting me back.
[01:03:59.762 --> 01:04:04.045]  It's always an honor to talk to you and your listeners.
[01:04:04.065 --> 01:04:05.626]  Where do you want to begin?
[01:04:05.646 --> 01:04:06.386]  This is a huge topic.
[01:04:19.312 --> 01:04:20.613]  Well, I'm in Ecuador.
[01:04:20.633 --> 01:04:27.859]  This is where I live permanently now, and if you hear construction sounds in the background, it's because I'm building a sustainable food forest here.
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:36.847]  You know, the food supply is a whole other topic that maybe we could talk about someday, but the food supply of the world is not as safe as people have been told.
[01:04:37.608 --> 01:04:43.653]  And myself and many other people are here making sure that we can feed ourselves, our families, and our neighbors when the time comes.
[01:04:44.383 --> 01:04:48.365]  Well, Monsanto, it's been in hundreds, literally hundreds, probably more studies.
[01:04:49.085 --> 01:04:53.647]  They've now, in major, in fact guys, print me that article about the liver failure again.
[01:04:54.267 --> 01:05:08.172]  It's confirmed in the most prestigious journals, massive liver and kidney failure and other organ failure of people that are eating different varieties, well, of the rats, but those are similar to humans, of mammals that are eating their GMO corn.
[01:05:08.412 --> 01:05:12.394]  I mean, it's all coming out, but let's get into the flu hoax
[01:05:13.214 --> 01:05:20.620]  First, because I don't think people realize just how devastating this is, and the fact that they're now being criminally investigated.
[01:05:22.701 --> 01:05:26.504]  Yeah, it was a huge scam, and they knew it from the beginning.
[01:05:26.524 --> 01:05:29.987]  And if you look at what they were trying to accomplish with this hoax,
[01:05:30.842 --> 01:05:32.683]  I think it was really two things, Alex.
[01:05:32.963 --> 01:05:44.790]  There are a couple of theories on this, but one, of course, was to transfer a tremendous amount of wealth, billions of dollars, from the taxpayers and governments into the pockets of the drug companies.
[01:05:45.330 --> 01:05:49.153]  And they did that very effectively by spreading fear, by spreading false information.
[01:05:49.173 --> 01:05:54.836]  I mean, they're still out there saying, you should take your vaccine shot because there could be another wave coming, you know?
[01:05:55.076 --> 01:05:56.237]  They just don't know when to quit.
[01:05:56.757 --> 01:05:58.418]  But the bigger agenda, I think,
[01:05:58.948 --> 01:06:22.106]  was to indoctrinate the American people into how they're supposed to behave when they're told to be afraid, and how they're supposed to line up and get injected with whatever chemicals they're told are safe, even though, Alex, you know this to be true, even though there has never been a single scientific clinical trial ever conducted on any of these
[01:06:22.731 --> 01:06:23.292]  We're good to go.
[01:06:39.215 --> 01:06:44.782]  And that's what the EU head of their health commission, he says, the bird flu vaccine killed a bunch of people.
[01:06:44.842 --> 01:06:46.184]  This flu vaccine's dangerous.
[01:06:46.504 --> 01:06:48.507]  The German government wouldn't even take this shot.
[01:06:49.148 --> 01:06:51.171]  People in government were paid off to push this.
[01:06:51.731 --> 01:06:53.514]  And they're having a huge investigation.
[01:06:53.554 --> 01:06:57.459]  I mean, it sounds like it's Mike Adams running that commission.
[01:06:59.157 --> 01:07:02.279]  Yeah, well, the truth eventually comes out on all these issues.
[01:07:02.339 --> 01:07:04.861]  I mean, they can't cover this up forever.
[01:07:05.221 --> 01:07:08.863]  If you look at who benefited from this scam, it's very obvious.
[01:07:09.183 --> 01:07:14.567]  For example, the former head of the CDC, Dr. Julie Gerberding.
[01:07:15.294 --> 01:07:26.901]  She, after being part of this scare story and part of pushing the vaccines, she was offered a position as president of the Division of Worldwide Vaccines for the drug company Merck.
[01:07:27.361 --> 01:07:36.026]  And she took that position, and she obviously benefited in a huge way, a personal financial way, from spreading this idea that everybody should take vaccines.
[01:07:38.588 --> 01:07:39.128]  Continue.
[01:07:40.248 --> 01:07:40.629]  Oh, okay.
[01:07:42.657 --> 01:07:57.524]  The WHO, World Health Organization, in my opinion, conspired with the CDC, conspired with the drug companies to falsely elevate this pandemic to a so-called level 6 pandemic, even though it was always very mild.
[01:07:57.924 --> 01:08:00.886]  There was never any indication that it had a high fatality rate.
[01:08:01.206 --> 01:08:08.209]  In fact, as you mentioned in the introduction to this segment, the fatalities for this were far lower than seasonal flu.
[01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:21.981]  And another fact that they're not telling people is that of those who did die from H1N1 infections, many of those people were vaccinated with H1N1 vaccine.
[01:08:22.942 --> 01:08:24.783]  I mean, have you ever seen that in the press?
[01:08:24.803 --> 01:08:27.746]  That some of the dead people were vaccinated and they died anyway.
[01:08:28.347 --> 01:08:29.427]  They don't tell you that, Alex.
[01:08:32.951 --> 01:08:33.911]  It's mind-blowing.
[01:08:33.971 --> 01:08:36.554]  It's mind-blowing to see this actually coming out in the open.
[01:08:38.083 --> 01:08:38.905]  Well yeah, finally.
[01:08:39.125 --> 01:08:41.109]  It's finally starting to get out there.
[01:08:41.691 --> 01:08:45.258]  And we've done things like, for example, I put out a $10,000 award.
[01:08:47.563 --> 01:08:54.627]  For anyone who can provide proof that the H1N1 vaccine had been proven safe and effective.
[01:08:55.108 --> 01:09:00.251]  And today, Alex, not one person has stepped forward to try to claim that $10,000.
[01:09:00.771 --> 01:09:09.897]  And yet, these vaccine pushers, they run around on the internet and all over the place in the media saying that their vaccines are scientific.
[01:09:10.467 --> 01:09:11.808]  You know, we're right and you're wrong.
[01:09:12.288 --> 01:09:15.250]  We have medical science and evidence on our side.
[01:09:15.330 --> 01:09:16.891]  Well, then why don't they claim the $10,000?
[01:09:17.492 --> 01:09:18.813]  Do they hate money?
[01:09:18.833 --> 01:09:26.978]  So, I think, Alex, I think I'm going to announce on your show here that I'm going to double that award.
[01:09:26.998 --> 01:09:28.139]  I'm going to double it to $20,000.
[01:09:29.901 --> 01:09:38.868]  Let's see if anyone will step forward and claim $20,000 to prove that those vaccines were ever scientifically proven to be safe and effective.
[01:09:39.088 --> 01:09:40.209]  Let's see if that works.
[01:09:42.050 --> 01:09:51.277]  Well, it could be $10 million they can't do it because it's not been proven safe or effective, but the feds and the New York Times put out fact sheets, as you know,
[01:09:52.893 --> 01:10:06.924]  At schools, at vaccine centers, at medical facilities and government buildings, saying, oh, this dispels the myth, can't cause Guillain-Barré, can't cause autoimmune disorder, doesn't contain mercury.
[01:10:07.384 --> 01:10:10.266]  And I think it's the level of the hoax that blew up in their face.
[01:10:10.306 --> 01:10:19.133]  That's why they went too far, because everybody just went and actually got the insert that actually came with the vaccine that said it could cause all of those problems that had mercury in it.
[01:10:19.433 --> 01:10:21.395]  I mean, it's the boldness of the lying.
[01:10:23.675 --> 01:10:24.436]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:10:24.476 --> 01:10:26.017]  They don't know when to stop.
[01:10:26.357 --> 01:10:45.553]  And I remember journalists interviewing me, mainstream journalists, who would say things like, no, we've been assured by the drug companies that these vaccines have no chemical adjuvants, which are the inflammatory chemicals that multiply a small vaccine batch into a larger batch so they can inject more people.
[01:10:45.693 --> 01:10:47.495]  And we know mercury and aluminum are adjuvants.
[01:10:48.655 --> 01:10:49.596]  Oh yeah, of course!
[01:10:50.096 --> 01:10:53.418]  You know, some of these vaccines have MSG-like chemicals in them.
[01:10:53.458 --> 01:10:55.219]  I mean, it's absolutely absurd.
[01:10:55.639 --> 01:11:01.123]  But it did blow up in their face because most people said, no, I'm not going to inject myself.
[01:11:01.443 --> 01:11:03.684]  I'm not going to subject my children to these poisons.
[01:11:04.084 --> 01:11:06.025]  And those people are doing just fine.
[01:11:06.386 --> 01:11:10.288]  Maybe they took some vitamin D. Maybe they ate some healthy food.
[01:11:10.328 --> 01:11:13.310]  Maybe they got a little sunshine or just took care of their immune system.
[01:11:13.650 --> 01:11:15.811]  They're alive and well and doing just great.
[01:11:15.891 --> 01:11:16.492]  They don't need...
[01:11:17.212 --> 01:11:23.476]  Cass Sunstein says it should be an illegal conspiracy theory to say that sunshine is good for you.
[01:11:24.096 --> 01:11:24.736]  Did you see that?
[01:11:25.857 --> 01:11:27.898]  No, that's a new one, but it doesn't surprise me.
[01:11:28.318 --> 01:11:29.079]  I'm not joking.
[01:11:29.759 --> 01:11:31.040]  I know that sounds crazy, folks.
[01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:32.441]  Just like K.I.
[01:11:32.461 --> 01:11:38.384]  and Austin saying mercury is good for kids' brains, it's in his Chicago Law School report from a year and a half ago.
[01:11:38.844 --> 01:11:43.187]  He says, let me give you an example of a conspiracy theory that's outrageous and should be illegal.
[01:11:44.622 --> 01:11:46.863]  People saying that some sunlight is good for you.
[01:11:47.363 --> 01:11:55.247]  When it's every major medical outfit out there, all the major studies of how it stops you from getting many forms of cancer, we're supposed to get some sunlight!
[01:11:55.907 --> 01:11:58.528]  We'll be right back with Mike Adams, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:00.809 --> 01:12:03.070]  Our economy is in great distress.
[01:12:03.690 --> 01:12:06.512]  The financial dominoes can fall at any time.
[01:12:07.232 --> 01:12:11.834]  It's time to stop hoping it doesn't happen and prepare just in case it does.
[01:12:12.748 --> 01:12:14.529]  You have auto and home insurance.
[01:12:15.410 --> 01:12:17.492]  Why wouldn't you have food insurance?
[01:12:18.612 --> 01:12:21.294]  Are you prepared to feed your family long-term?
[01:12:21.915 --> 01:12:23.796]  Because it might take years to recover.
[01:12:24.557 --> 01:12:30.261]  As the adult, it's your responsibility to feed your family, especially during rough times.
[01:12:31.101 --> 01:12:37.146]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is offering a package that will give you a three-acre heirloom vegetable garden
[01:12:38.425 --> 01:12:50.099]  Don't be fooled by marketing companies disguised as patriots.
[01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:56.848]  Survivalistseeds.com is owned by Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[01:13:00.376 --> 01:13:04.041]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:13:04.402 --> 01:13:07.406]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:13:07.647 --> 01:13:09.069]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:13:09.770 --> 01:13:12.451]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:13:13.211 --> 01:13:18.692]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:13:18.832 --> 01:13:23.853]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:13:24.374 --> 01:13:33.996]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:13:34.116 --> 01:13:36.238]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:13:36.478 --> 01:13:37.800]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:40.342]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:13:40.522 --> 01:13:42.364]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:13:42.645 --> 01:13:47.469]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:13:47.810 --> 01:13:56.919]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:13:58.945 --> 01:14:00.506]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:14:00.726 --> 01:14:01.166]  January 25th, 2010.
[01:14:01.246 --> 01:14:02.227]  Gold opened this morning at $10.99.50.
[01:14:02.267 --> 01:14:05.789]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $11.29.63, $5.64.83 for a half-ounce, or $2.82.41 for the quarter-ounce.
[01:14:05.829 --> 01:14:06.069]  That's $11.29.63, $5.64.83.
[01:14:16.675 --> 01:14:32.524]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[01:14:32.604 --> 01:14:41.228]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:14:41.449 --> 01:14:42.329]  Hi, Ted Anderson
[01:14:42.529 --> 01:14:46.673]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[01:14:46.873 --> 01:14:47.814]  Call for your copy.

[01:14:49.835 --> 01:14:49.996]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:14:50.076 --> 01:14:50.376]  That's 800-686-2237.

[01:15:11.149 --> 01:15:15.131]  And they know exactly how to help you rid your home or office of these harmful toxins.
[01:15:15.452 --> 01:15:19.954]  Did you know that your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?

[01:15:47.610 --> 01:15:48.571]  Purify your life today.
[01:15:48.611 --> 01:15:50.532]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:15:50.572 --> 01:15:52.874]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:16:09.085 --> 01:16:12.749]  International hearings begin on falsified swine flu pandemic.
[01:16:13.129 --> 01:16:14.230]  InfoWars.net.
[01:16:14.250 --> 01:16:14.991]  Steve Watson.
[01:16:15.391 --> 01:16:26.682]  We have the official 47 nation body health board in order to promote their, this is from the head of the board, in order to promote their
[01:16:27.884 --> 01:16:30.647]  Patented drugs and vaccines against flu.
[01:16:30.727 --> 01:16:46.745]  Pharmaceutical companies influence scientists and official agencies responsible for health standards to alarm governments worldwide and make them squander their tight health resources for inefficient vaccine strategy and needlessly expose millions of healthy people to the risk of an unknown amount of side effects.
[01:16:47.785 --> 01:16:48.385]  Okay.
[01:17:16.161 --> 01:17:27.716]  We know that the federal government secretly went into health boards around the country, and this happened everywhere else in the world, a strategic operation, and told them in January and February, flu is coming, it's going to kill millions per state.
[01:17:27.736 --> 01:17:30.840]  That's what they told New York State, Indiana, Illinois.
[01:17:32.542 --> 01:17:34.504]  We knew it was really going to a level six in
[01:17:35.692 --> 01:17:39.836]  April, two months before it did, because of internal health board documents we got.
[01:17:40.296 --> 01:17:41.017]  State of Texas.
[01:17:41.357 --> 01:17:43.439]  I mean, this was a concerted hype.
[01:17:43.919 --> 01:17:47.262]  This was a concerted program to scare the hell out of everybody.
[01:17:47.502 --> 01:17:48.023]  Mike Adams.
[01:17:49.564 --> 01:17:51.186]  Absolutely, it was, Alex.
[01:17:51.326 --> 01:17:54.349]  And it worked, like gangbusters, for a very long time.
[01:17:55.615 --> 01:18:03.960]  This is the way that they create demand for vaccines while also creating an engineered shortage of supply.
[01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:24.732]  And if you look at the work of covert persuasion and human psychology and some of the research that has been conducted over the years, you know that the most effective way to motivate people to want something is to first make them afraid so that they have to have it and then tell them there isn't enough to go around.
[01:18:25.649 --> 01:18:30.312]  They use this in order to get people lining up for swine flu vaccine.
[01:18:30.712 --> 01:18:32.113]  And it worked extremely well.
[01:18:32.513 --> 01:18:40.418]  And then, of course, when the whole thing, when the hoax broke, and they had plenty of supply of vaccine, the whole thing reversed on them.
[01:18:40.458 --> 01:18:47.943]  And people realized, well, gee, there's plenty of supply now, and the pandemic isn't really a pandemic.
[01:18:48.023 --> 01:18:55.147]  And we even have the CFR recorded, where they talk about, we'll say there's not enough vaccine to make everybody run out and want to get it.
[01:18:57.658 --> 01:19:00.802]  Yeah, the tactics here have been really remarkable.
[01:19:01.102 --> 01:19:09.150]  But the most interesting part about this, Alex, has been the viciousness of the vaccine pushers.
[01:19:09.671 --> 01:19:12.354]  And you've got to realize, when you're dealing with vaccine pushers,
[01:19:12.944 --> 01:19:30.137]  These are people who, in my opinion, because they've taken so many vaccines in the past, and their brains have been bathed in these chemical adjuvants, these people are literally, and this is not an insult of a term, this is a scientific description, they are brain damaged.
[01:19:30.277 --> 01:19:33.540]  They lack cognitive function to think for themselves.
[01:19:34.372 --> 01:19:42.415]  This is part of the agenda, I believe, Alex, that the vaccines are designed to create a nation of people who cannot think for themselves.
[01:19:42.435 --> 01:19:43.055]  It's kind of like the Floyd.
[01:19:43.075 --> 01:19:43.776]  Well, we know this.
[01:19:43.856 --> 01:19:49.678]  I mean, they're on the news saying mercury is good for your children now, treating us like we're totally brain damaged.
[01:19:49.698 --> 01:19:50.378]  And now the U.N.'
[01:19:50.358 --> 01:19:52.599]  's having to lower the average IQ.
[01:19:52.999 --> 01:19:56.941]  And pretty soon you'll be a genius if you're able to say your ABCs or tie your shoelaces.
[01:19:57.868 --> 01:20:02.391]  Well, there's that movie, Idiocracy, starring Luke Wilson.
[01:20:02.431 --> 01:20:04.532]  It was a wonderful movie.
[01:20:05.633 --> 01:20:07.134]  Yeah, Mike Judge created the movie, right?
[01:20:07.434 --> 01:20:13.778]  And in the previous segment, you were talking about Mark Dice going out and having people sign the petition to repeal the First Amendment.
[01:20:14.018 --> 01:20:15.019]  And they weren't signing it!
[01:20:15.939 --> 01:20:21.403]  People have forgotten how to think, or they are seriously so brain damaged that they cannot
[01:20:22.103 --> 01:20:24.404]  Well, by the way, Mike, that's not your opinion.
[01:20:24.524 --> 01:20:27.744]  I mean, we have the sodium fluoride and other chemicals put in the water.
[01:20:27.784 --> 01:20:28.765]  They know brain damages.
[01:20:29.005 --> 01:20:31.525]  We have government documents where they said they would do it to control people.
[01:20:31.745 --> 01:20:34.266]  We know mercury is the most deadly heavy metal for brain damage.
[01:20:34.606 --> 01:20:37.086]  We know that they want to drug the population.
[01:20:37.126 --> 01:20:38.947]  We have the New Freedom Initiative documents.
[01:20:39.407 --> 01:20:42.748]  This is in all the UN documents, how they were going to drug the population.
[01:20:42.788 --> 01:20:43.708]  It's the brave new world.
[01:20:44.770 --> 01:20:45.390]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:50.832]  And don't forget the Mothers Act and the mental health initiatives for expectant mothers.
[01:20:50.872 --> 01:20:53.692]  They want to drug the babies before they're even born.
[01:20:53.932 --> 01:20:56.953]  And now they're saying they want to put lithium in the water supply.
[01:20:56.973 --> 01:20:58.073]  Have you seen that newscast?
[01:20:59.574 --> 01:20:59.974]  You know what?
[01:21:00.274 --> 01:21:02.595]  I can't keep track of all the poison agendas.
[01:21:02.635 --> 01:21:03.555]  There's just too much.
[01:21:03.875 --> 01:21:07.396]  By the way, I'm not joking about the CFR audio blog.
[01:21:07.416 --> 01:21:11.557]  They put it out where they talked about how they were hoaxing people by saying there wasn't enough vaccine.
[01:21:14.753 --> 01:21:16.434]  Again, nothing surprises me at this point.
[01:21:16.655 --> 01:21:22.438]  If there's anything that we've learned from this pandemic and the way people have acted, it's that they will do anything.
[01:21:22.458 --> 01:21:34.145]  The vaccine-pushing jackals, I call them sometimes, they will do anything to get more vaccines injected into more babies, more men and women, more senior citizens.
[01:21:34.385 --> 01:21:35.245]  They'll do anything.
[01:21:35.286 --> 01:21:36.346]  They'll lie.
[01:21:36.606 --> 01:21:37.287]  They'll deceive.
[01:21:37.307 --> 01:21:37.967]  They'll distort.
[01:21:37.987 --> 01:21:38.888]  They'll commit fraud.
[01:21:39.928 --> 01:21:42.630]  And this is just normal, everyday business for them.
[01:21:43.803 --> 01:21:48.410]  Just like the local Austin News saying it's illegal for private people to sell guns when it's not.
[01:21:49.512 --> 01:21:50.413]  We're on the march.
[01:21:50.914 --> 01:21:52.516]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:53.437 --> 01:21:56.142]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:58.852 --> 01:22:04.197]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:22:04.237 --> 01:22:06.979]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.

[01:22:59.312 --> 01:23:01.933]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:23:02.334 --> 01:23:07.296]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:23:07.657 --> 01:23:09.397]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:23:09.698 --> 01:23:14.520]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:15.681]  How much do you want?
[01:23:15.881 --> 01:23:16.641]  When do you want it?
[01:23:17.022 --> 01:23:18.623]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:23:18.903 --> 01:23:19.723]  When will you need it?
[01:23:19.963 --> 01:23:22.044]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:23:22.184 --> 01:23:23.285]  Will there be any food?
[01:23:23.525 --> 01:23:24.826]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:23:25.046 --> 01:23:30.109]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:23:30.289 --> 01:23:33.491]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:23:33.872 --> 01:23:37.394]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:23:37.694 --> 01:23:38.695]  How much will you need?
[01:23:38.935 --> 01:23:39.535]  We don't know.
[01:23:39.835 --> 01:23:40.756]  How much do you want?
[01:23:40.936 --> 01:23:41.656]  All you can get.
[01:23:41.676 --> 01:23:42.517]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:23:42.637 --> 01:23:43.037]  I think.
[01:23:58.618 --> 01:23:59.599]  What's your home worth?
[01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:01.702]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[01:24:01.882 --> 01:24:04.626]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[01:24:04.926 --> 01:24:12.455]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[01:25:12.848 --> 01:25:12.948]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:25:12.968 --> 01:25:13.028]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:25:29.815 --> 01:25:31.276]  We're going back to him in just a moment.
[01:25:31.376 --> 01:25:42.223]  Don't forget, there is a protest against the racketeering, harassment, shutdown of the oldest gun show in Central Texas today, 5 to 7 p.m.
[01:25:42.383 --> 01:25:43.604]  Be there early, folks.
[01:25:44.104 --> 01:25:45.745]  I'm gonna be there right before 5.
[01:25:47.086 --> 01:25:51.689]  It's 7th and 8th Street on the west side of I-35, the Austin Police Station.
[01:25:51.869 --> 01:25:53.971]  West side of I-35, you cannot miss it.
[01:25:55.063 --> 01:25:59.065]  They've got giant Big Brother banners hanging up, worshipping checkpoints.
[01:25:59.185 --> 01:26:01.647]  Last time I drove by, they always change them out.
[01:26:01.687 --> 01:26:02.567]  I'm not sure what's up there now.
[01:26:02.607 --> 01:26:11.233]  The point is, it's a big brick building, one of scores of facilities they have, and you can go and let them know you don't appreciate what they've done.
[01:26:11.273 --> 01:26:13.554]  The media will be there, be able to talk to the media.
[01:26:13.954 --> 01:26:16.516]  I know the media has been alerted, but everybody else should contact the media.
[01:26:17.256 --> 01:26:18.877]  And tell them to be there.
[01:26:19.017 --> 01:26:22.880]  All the radio, TV stations, you name it, they need to be there.
[01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:29.044]  We're going back to Mike Adams here in just a moment, the health ranger, about this big victory we've had.
[01:26:29.064 --> 01:26:31.805]  Because this is record amounts of people didn't take this shot.
[01:26:32.366 --> 01:26:34.967]  It's a big controversy in England and Europe and the U.S.
[01:26:34.987 --> 01:26:37.789]  that there's so much of this vaccine that was bought rotting that no one wants.
[01:26:38.630 --> 01:26:39.350]  That is coming up.
[01:26:39.370 --> 01:26:42.032]  I'm also going to get into all the other info on GMO food.
[01:26:43.336 --> 01:26:49.838]  For those of you that aren't aware of what's happening to you, but before we do that, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that have made today's radio show possible.
[01:26:50.718 --> 01:26:53.699]  Tap water, in most cities, is a toxic brew.
[01:26:53.739 --> 01:26:59.601]  When they say fluoride in your water, that's over 150 on average, sometimes over 300 chemicals they add to the water.
[01:27:00.341 --> 01:27:03.702]  The chlorine, the dead bacteria, it just tastes like crud.
[01:27:04.282 --> 01:27:06.242]  And a lot of filtered water isn't high quality.
[01:27:06.262 --> 01:27:07.723]  A lot of bottled water has problems.
[01:27:08.832 --> 01:27:10.272]  People still drink it because it tastes better.
[01:27:10.412 --> 01:27:12.353]  The Ecolablue is the best water you can get.
[01:27:12.473 --> 01:27:12.973]  Period.
[01:27:13.113 --> 01:27:14.153]  Ecolablue.com.
[01:27:14.193 --> 01:27:19.594]  It grabs the water right out of the atmosphere, sends it through seven filters with their Ecolablue 28.
[01:27:19.634 --> 01:27:21.115]  They have their Ecolablue 30.
[01:27:21.775 --> 01:27:26.056]  Puts it through 12 stage, including reverse osmosis, carbon, UV light.
[01:27:26.476 --> 01:27:27.576]  Ecolablue.com.
[01:27:27.676 --> 01:27:29.717]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com.
[01:27:30.077 --> 01:27:30.177]  Or 800-691-8000.
[01:27:31.817 --> 01:27:31.997]  6043-800-691-6043.
[01:27:32.077 --> 01:27:34.100]  Another great sponsor, Front Sight Firearms Training.
[01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:35.121]  FrontSight.com.
[01:27:41.889 --> 01:27:50.175]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at the Front Sight's Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[01:27:50.215 --> 01:27:56.659]  Plus, if you act fast, the millionaire patriot who owns it will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:27:57.099 --> 01:28:02.002]  I believe now is the time for you and your family to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:28:02.383 --> 01:28:06.606]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[01:28:07.386 --> 01:28:09.948]  The Millionaire Patriot is paying his own money to help you get this.
[01:28:10.369 --> 01:28:10.969]  This is real.
[01:28:11.009 --> 01:28:11.710]  This is awesome.
[01:28:11.970 --> 01:28:14.392]  This is the biggest private firearms training facility in the country.
[01:28:14.672 --> 01:28:15.853]  Shotguns, handguns, rifles.
[01:28:16.154 --> 01:28:16.714]  FrontSight.
[01:28:16.854 --> 01:28:17.915]  One word, like the front of your rifle.
[01:28:18.155 --> 01:28:19.136]  FrontSight.com.
[01:28:19.156 --> 01:28:20.097]  Plus, it's a great website.
[01:28:20.117 --> 01:28:22.659]  A lot of resources for gun owners and defenders of liberty.
[01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:25.822]  Free email alert system and newsletter.
[01:28:26.182 --> 01:28:27.623]  FrontSight.com.
[01:28:28.584 --> 01:28:29.885]  Okay, going back to Mike Adams.
[01:28:30.065 --> 01:28:32.728]  Mike, there's so much to cover here dealing with the flu.
[01:28:34.676 --> 01:28:57.208]  I mean, a lot of people did get stampeded to take it, but a lot of people, I mean, they're reporting record numbers didn't, so there's just millions and millions and millions and millions, what is it, 50-something million in the U.S., tens of millions in England, of these dosages just sitting there, these vials of this monkey pus that they wanted to inject into people, and the whole history of what vaccines have done.
[01:28:57.788 --> 01:29:01.370]  I mean, do you see this as I do, as a devastating defeat for these people?
[01:29:02.897 --> 01:29:03.758]  Well, sure it is.
[01:29:03.878 --> 01:29:12.022]  Of course, they're going to try to spin it as a success because several million people did decide to get vaccinated because they fell for all the propaganda.
[01:29:12.062 --> 01:29:18.365]  But even in America, four out of five people refused to be vaccinated or just avoided being vaccinated.
[01:29:18.405 --> 01:29:20.246]  So what they're going to try to do now
[01:29:20.946 --> 01:29:26.608]  ...is donate these vaccines to third-world countries so they can look like they have some human compassion.
[01:29:26.948 --> 01:29:30.210]  Truth is, they're only donating them because they can't sell them to anybody.
[01:29:30.250 --> 01:29:31.310]  Nobody wants them anymore.
[01:29:31.770 --> 01:29:34.491]  And they're too toxic to dump into landfills.
[01:29:34.531 --> 01:29:36.152]  That would be a DPA violation.
[01:29:36.432 --> 01:29:39.893]  Remember that if you ever think about injecting this stuff into your own body.
[01:29:40.253 --> 01:29:42.594]  So they're going to dump them off to third-world countries.
[01:29:42.614 --> 01:29:47.456]  Maybe they'll get Bill Gates to come in and sponsor some of that, too, because he's all about vaccines in third-world countries.
[01:29:47.876 --> 01:29:52.558]  They're going to try to claim a victory no matter what, even though they have failed miserably.
[01:30:09.825 --> 01:30:11.626]  Uh, death of homeless, bird flu vaccine.
[01:30:12.046 --> 01:30:13.447]  They told him it was a regular flu shot.
[01:30:13.467 --> 01:30:15.488]  Then you talk about how they're dubbing him on The Third World.
[01:30:15.528 --> 01:30:16.648]  They have announced they're doing that.
[01:30:17.209 --> 01:30:26.073]  That'll be by next year or later, when this has already run its course, and it'll have no effect, and they admit even the H1N1's already mutated onto something else.
[01:30:26.413 --> 01:30:30.295]  Just totally worthless, but they'll just line people up and give them the mercury-filled injection.
[01:30:31.616 --> 01:30:32.076]  Well, yeah, sure.
[01:30:32.096 --> 01:30:36.160]  There's a bigger agenda here that I'll mention here in a second.
[01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:40.965]  But first, on the actual number of people who were killed, we know that people have been paralyzed.
[01:30:40.985 --> 01:30:43.707]  They've suffered neurological damage from the vaccines themselves.
[01:30:43.987 --> 01:30:46.310]  But that's just short-term, immediate-term effects.
[01:30:46.650 --> 01:30:54.217]  What people don't know is what will be the long-term effects of taking these vaccines, what happens two years down the road or five years down the road.
[01:30:54.517 --> 01:31:05.377]  Do you get Alzheimer's 10 years sooner than you might have... Well, the studies show that if you take three flu shots, you get double the chances of Alzheimer's.
[01:31:06.491 --> 01:31:06.951]  Absolutely.
[01:31:06.991 --> 01:31:11.034]  Well, and it makes perfect sense why, because the stuff attacks the nervous system.
[01:31:11.114 --> 01:31:15.076]  It causes inflammatory nervous system damage in many people who take them.
[01:31:15.356 --> 01:31:19.579]  But the bigger agenda here, Alex, isn't really about swine flu or any flu.
[01:31:19.819 --> 01:31:22.120]  The bigger agenda is about vaccines.
[01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:30.125]  And the drug companies, they've stumbled onto a really clever scam here, where they can now sell vaccines to people who aren't sick.
[01:31:30.623 --> 01:31:33.845]  Because, you know, drugs are sort of limited to people who are sick.
[01:31:33.925 --> 01:31:35.686]  People who have an illness, right?
[01:31:36.006 --> 01:31:38.568]  But vaccines, you can push them on to everybody.
[01:31:38.948 --> 01:31:39.888]  You don't need to be sick.
[01:31:40.168 --> 01:31:41.489]  You don't need to have any symptoms.
[01:31:41.769 --> 01:31:44.191]  You don't need to have any medical justification whatsoever.
[01:31:44.451 --> 01:31:47.933]  You can push vaccines on the people just out of fear alone.
[01:31:48.153 --> 01:31:51.955]  So they're working on vaccines now for all kinds of crazy... Cigarettes!
[01:31:52.075 --> 01:31:52.355]  Alcohol!
[01:31:53.476 --> 01:31:54.758]  Sadness, for example.
[01:31:55.638 --> 01:31:57.921]  And they're going to push these on all of us.
[01:31:58.542 --> 01:31:59.603]  Unlimited vaccines.
[01:31:59.903 --> 01:32:08.813]  From the time you're born, even before you're born, to the time that you die, you are nothing but a vessel to accept more chemical vaccine injections while you make the drug companies rich.
[01:32:09.232 --> 01:32:11.653]  And that's the big issue that we haven't really gotten into.
[01:32:12.074 --> 01:32:16.216]  They tried to make this mandatory in Massachusetts, in New York, in California.
[01:32:16.576 --> 01:32:18.577]  Lawsuits got filed by valiant people.
[01:32:19.218 --> 01:32:20.078]  It got stopped.
[01:32:20.438 --> 01:32:28.363]  But they certainly are using this as a form of medical tyranny, as Ron Paul has said, to set the precedent to put in our bodies what they want, when they want.
[01:32:29.890 --> 01:32:30.650]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:32:30.730 --> 01:32:32.911]  There have been efforts all across the country.
[01:32:33.011 --> 01:32:43.974]  There was even a risk of it happening in Texas, where the Gardasil vaccine for HPV was about to be mandated for teenage girls.
[01:32:44.734 --> 01:32:46.954]  And, you know... Lastly, Rick Perry ran the hoax.
[01:32:47.354 --> 01:32:49.635]  Rick Perry ran the hoax and said it was the law.
[01:32:49.895 --> 01:32:53.276]  When it wasn't, he made it a recommended shot to the state health department.
[01:32:54.682 --> 01:32:55.342]  Right, right.
[01:32:55.883 --> 01:33:09.368]  And, you know, I agree with Rick Perry on many other issues, but on vaccines, I think he got a little hoodwinked by the drug companies, and hopefully he'll come around and realize that vaccines should never be forced onto anyone.
[01:33:09.408 --> 01:33:15.090]  It should always be the free choice of the parents, not the state, and certainly not the federal government.
[01:33:16.943 --> 01:33:17.563]  Well said.
[01:33:18.223 --> 01:33:42.591]  Shifting gears, Monsanto GMO corn linked to organ failure study reveals, I mean we've known this forever, in a study released by the International Journal of Biological Sciences, that doesn't get any more prestigious for those that don't know, analyzing the effects of genetically modified foods on mammalian, that's mammals, that's us, researchers found that agricultural giant Monsanto GM corn is linked to organ damage in rats.
[01:33:43.251 --> 01:33:46.372]  They study rats because they're very similar to us in their metabolic system, for those that don't know.
[01:33:46.392 --> 01:34:06.419]  According to the study, which was summarized by, and it goes on, three varieties of Monsanto GM corn, MON-863, insecticide-producing, MON-810, and Roundup herbicide-absorbing NK-603, were approved for consumption by the U.S., European, and several other national food safety authorities.
[01:34:07.199 --> 01:34:18.527]  And it goes on to talk about the effects from the journal were mostly concentrated in the kidney and liver function, the two major diet detoxification organs, but in detail different from each GM type.
[01:34:18.567 --> 01:34:24.230]  In addition, some effects on the heart, adrenal, spleen, blood cells were also frequently noted.
[01:34:24.711 --> 01:34:26.092]  There were as
[01:34:26.972 --> 01:34:30.814]  There normally exists sex differences in the liver and kidney metabolic system.
[01:34:31.154 --> 01:34:42.460]  The highly statistical significant disturbances in the function of these organs, seen between male and female racts, cannot be dismissed as biologically insufficient, as has been proposed by others.
[01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:55.246]  Therefore, we conclude that our data strongly suggests that these GM maize varieties, those are the ones killing the bees, induce a state of, and it says, heptarelia toxicity.
[01:34:56.477 --> 01:34:57.678]  I'm sure I'm mispronouncing that.
[01:34:57.758 --> 01:35:06.306]  These substances have never before been an integral part of human and animal diet and therefore health consequences for those who consume them, especially over long periods.
[01:35:06.666 --> 01:35:08.528]  Now, this is very simple.
[01:35:10.029 --> 01:35:22.521]  If you produce a pharmacological variety of corn that produces a pesticide within it, or if you produce corn that will live when everything else dies when you spray herbicide on it,
[01:35:23.769 --> 01:35:24.549]  And it absorbs it.
[01:35:25.190 --> 01:35:27.751]  Obviously, it's going to attack the liver and kidneys and the blood.
[01:35:28.071 --> 01:35:30.332]  I mean, this is a two-year-old can figure this out.
[01:35:30.892 --> 01:35:42.617]  Other bugs, and I've again interviewed top German scientists who first exposed this five years ago, other bugs will not eat this corn and they won't go to the corn pollination process.
[01:35:42.697 --> 01:35:43.297]  Bee will!
[01:35:43.937 --> 01:35:48.238]  And the poor little guys are dying and they've done maps of the areas where these corn are grown.
[01:35:48.598 --> 01:35:51.119]  I mean, you know, Monsanto knows what it's doing.
[01:35:51.159 --> 01:35:52.219]  It's like Satan runs it.
[01:35:52.259 --> 01:35:54.340]  We know Rumsfeld previously did.
[01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:58.221]  I mean, literally, is Satan in a red pajamas at the boardroom with his feet up?
[01:35:58.821 --> 01:36:00.562]  This is the corn that's in most our food.
[01:36:00.962 --> 01:36:02.022]  They know what they're doing.
[01:36:02.062 --> 01:36:02.722]  They don't care.
[01:36:02.762 --> 01:36:04.303]  I mean, Mike Adams, I had...
[01:36:05.450 --> 01:36:13.657]  A magazine reporter interviewed me last night, and I kept saying, he said, you know, you can't just say Monsanto's doing this and knows what they're doing.
[01:36:14.477 --> 01:36:15.238]  That's irresponsible.
[01:36:15.278 --> 01:36:24.686]  And I said, sir, it's mainstream news, and he just looked at me like I was crazy, because he can't believe, because he's a nice person, that this is really going on.
[01:36:24.706 --> 01:36:27.688]  I mean, folks, it's going on, okay?
[01:36:28.108 --> 01:36:28.709]  Mike Adams.
[01:36:29.790 --> 01:36:34.754]  Well, people need to understand that human nature can be far darker
[01:36:35.621 --> 01:36:52.477]  And you've been led to believe, if you live in a civilized society, you don't see what goes on behind the closed doors of corporate boardrooms, where the real selfishness and the evil and the destructiveness of some of these individuals is unleashed through their corporate agendas.
[01:36:52.538 --> 01:36:59.104]  And I agree with you that Monsanto, in my opinion, is one of the most dangerous corporations on our planet.
[01:36:59.688 --> 01:37:03.049]  And they are, in my view, poisoning the food supply.
[01:37:03.530 --> 01:37:08.571]  I hope... I don't know if you've had Jeffrey Smith on your show from seedsofdeception.com, right?
[01:37:08.672 --> 01:37:09.172]  We sell it.
[01:37:09.192 --> 01:37:10.272]  We sell his books and videos.
[01:37:11.313 --> 01:37:14.874]  Everyone needs to read his material and watch his documentaries.
[01:37:15.934 --> 01:37:18.316]  He presents information that will blow your mind.
[01:37:18.376 --> 01:37:22.380]  And it's so shocking that the mainstream journalists just can't accept it.
[01:37:22.881 --> 01:37:28.466]  And it gets back to this question of what is wrong with people's thinking skills these days?
[01:37:28.506 --> 01:37:34.833]  How come they can't question things like- Close to 90% of people in San Diego that were interviewed said ban free speech!
[01:37:36.104 --> 01:37:44.052]  Yeah, and I remember Dice was out there trying to sell an ounce of gold, a gold coin, for what, 50 bucks or 20 bucks?
[01:37:44.292 --> 01:37:47.736]  It was an ounce of gold worth, you know, what, $1,100 or more.
[01:37:48.096 --> 01:37:48.997]  No one would buy it!
[01:37:50.779 --> 01:37:52.240]  What's wrong with people these days?
[01:37:53.081 --> 01:37:54.402]  I don't have the answer to that Alex.
[01:37:54.442 --> 01:37:57.163]  The average adult watches two and a half hours.
[01:37:57.263 --> 01:38:00.405]  This is the latest numbers from 2009 from Nielsen.
[01:38:00.445 --> 01:38:02.946]  Two and a half hours of internet TV a week.
[01:38:03.506 --> 01:38:05.047]  Four and a half of television.
[01:38:05.067 --> 01:38:05.868]  They're mesmerized.
[01:38:05.888 --> 01:38:06.668]  They're not awake.
[01:38:07.028 --> 01:38:08.249]  People are zombies.
[01:38:09.397 --> 01:38:10.878]  Yeah, they won't, they really aren't.
[01:38:10.898 --> 01:38:27.533]  I think if you remember the old zombie movies and zombies attack and you would have fields of mindless people wandering around society attacking each other, that really isn't too far off from what may be coming at some point here in the real world.
[01:38:27.993 --> 01:38:28.334]  We're good.
[01:38:45.194 --> 01:38:45.494]  We're good.
[01:39:02.563 --> 01:39:13.533]  We can see Americans take back America and take back what it stands for, what it was founded on, and what we all are owed, our God-given rights to liberty, to health, to access to information.
[01:39:13.873 --> 01:39:17.056]  This is what we all deserve and we must take it back, Alex.
[01:39:17.836 --> 01:39:20.359]  Well, I want to say this to the police and military listening.
[01:39:21.468 --> 01:39:21.788]  You see, Bart,
[01:39:48.502 --> 01:39:51.886]  Well, part of it might be that they want to kill the rats, but we are the rats.
[01:39:52.907 --> 01:39:54.268]  We're the rats and they want to kill us.
[01:39:54.328 --> 01:39:55.970]  No, no, I know exactly.
[01:39:56.010 --> 01:39:56.750]  That's the endgame.
[01:39:57.131 --> 01:40:08.963]  Mike, I know it's the endgame, but I'm saying the average cop driving along right now, he's like, hey, my corn taco, you know, when he pulls into a Mexican food drive-thru window, you know, it's fine.
[01:40:10.046 --> 01:40:14.609]  But no, it's turned out they sell this corn at below regular prices to all the major chains.
[01:40:14.909 --> 01:40:18.452]  This is what you're getting as food filler in cereals and in everything.
[01:40:18.612 --> 01:40:24.235]  And they're GMO-ing all the other major grains and the soybean.
[01:40:25.576 --> 01:40:29.177]  They're now moving into hundreds of other things, and they're shutting the farms down.
[01:40:29.237 --> 01:40:31.978]  I mean, folks, you are being killed!
[01:40:32.618 --> 01:40:39.680]  I mean... And sugar beets now, genetically modified sugar beets, are now approved and being used to produce processed sugar.
[01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:52.463]  So, you know, now you have, you have what, high fructose corn syrup, which is called liquid Satan by some people because it's so bad for your health, and now you have genetically modified sugar as the mainstream sugar source in the food supply.
[01:40:52.703 --> 01:40:54.024]  And then the Washington Post...
[01:40:54.844 --> 01:40:55.465]  I'm sorry to interrupt.
[01:40:55.505 --> 01:41:02.611]  In the Washington Post reported last year, 50% of the corn syrup has high levels of mercury and they don't know why.
[01:41:02.931 --> 01:41:04.152]  It's not even involved in the process.
[01:41:04.412 --> 01:41:09.136]  Folks, they're hitting you and hitting you hard and now we're exposing them so they say, you know what, mercury's good.
[01:41:09.176 --> 01:41:11.838]  If fat guys pull up, 50% of corn syrup has mercury.
[01:41:11.878 --> 01:41:12.619]  Washington Post for folks.
[01:41:12.839 --> 01:41:13.560]  I'm sorry, go ahead Mike.
[01:41:14.701 --> 01:41:21.446]  Well, the problem here is, and I understand this, but even people listening to this may be thinking to themselves, well, what am I supposed to do?
[01:41:21.506 --> 01:41:23.187]  It's so overwhelming.
[01:41:23.587 --> 01:41:26.749]  How do we decide what to trust, what to not trust?
[01:41:27.049 --> 01:41:30.351]  How do we feed our kids something that won't poison them?
[01:41:30.391 --> 01:41:31.752]  It's just so overwhelming.
[01:41:32.173 --> 01:41:35.635]  And there's too much conflicting information out there, but that's part of the game.
[01:41:37.556 --> 01:41:38.217]  And why?
[01:41:51.761 --> 01:41:54.962]  And Mike, it's just like poisoning animals that they want to get rid of.
[01:41:55.202 --> 01:41:58.284]  They'll poison their water supply with a slow-acting poison.
[01:41:58.684 --> 01:42:05.607]  And so the animals don't drop dead right on the spot, so the wild dogs or whatever they're poisoning drink it and a month later die.
[01:42:06.327 --> 01:42:08.048]  And that's what the UN said they would do.
[01:42:08.088 --> 01:42:15.070]  I have all these government documents where they said, we will introduce it into the food, into the water, and we will brain damage people and then kill them.
[01:42:15.170 --> 01:42:16.171]  And they're doing it!
[01:42:16.731 --> 01:42:21.013]  And the public can't even get angry right now because they're on a toxic sedative
[01:42:21.793 --> 01:42:22.493]  Uh, fluoride.
[01:42:23.794 --> 01:42:24.674]  That's exactly it.
[01:42:25.294 --> 01:42:26.254]  You nailed it.
[01:42:26.334 --> 01:42:29.135]  It's kind of a brilliant, evil, genius conspiracy.
[01:42:29.595 --> 01:42:35.596]  To first numb the population and then just sort of kill them off slowly through the food supply.
[01:42:35.636 --> 01:42:39.357]  Well, they've already accomplished most of that goal and the rest is coming.
[01:42:39.917 --> 01:42:42.298]  There's a Batman episode, one of the Batman movies.
[01:42:43.118 --> 01:42:48.163]  Where the bad guy says, yeah, we staged the Gulf of Tonkin, we staged terror attacks, this is from the early 90s.
[01:42:48.824 --> 01:42:53.328]  And then he says, and we're gonna put different poisons and different cosmetics, and they'll never know.
[01:42:53.349 --> 01:42:54.710]  Then we'll sell them the cure.
[01:42:55.290 --> 01:42:57.373]  They're just throwing it in our face, what they're doing.
[01:42:58.482 --> 01:43:06.905]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[01:43:07.185 --> 01:43:12.867]  At hempusa.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.
[01:43:13.187 --> 01:43:19.709]  At hempusa.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[01:43:20.279 --> 01:43:23.562]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[01:43:23.682 --> 01:43:25.924]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.
[01:43:26.124 --> 01:43:32.490]  This nutrient-dense food can be stored up to five years when vacuum-packed and is priced affordably to be used as a storable food.
[01:43:32.731 --> 01:43:36.054]  HempUSA.org is a bulk shipper starting with five pounds and up.
[01:43:36.254 --> 01:43:40.117]  To allow this food to work for you, call 908-691-2608 or go to HempUSA.org and order today.
[01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:46.242]  The body will react and heal itself given the proper nutrition.
[01:43:46.462 --> 01:43:48.523]  This superfood will be your greatest asset.
[01:43:48.663 --> 01:43:52.025]  So try it today, store it today, and change your life.
[01:43:52.325 --> 01:43:57.348]  Call 908-691-2608 or order from hempusa.org.
[01:43:59.329 --> 01:44:03.011]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:44:03.331 --> 01:44:06.353]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:44:06.593 --> 01:44:07.994]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:44:08.712 --> 01:44:11.353]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:44:11.373 --> 01:44:17.615]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:44:17.755 --> 01:44:22.797]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:44:22.817 --> 01:44:32.921]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:44:33.061 --> 01:44:35.163]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:44:35.403 --> 01:44:36.744]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:44:36.984 --> 01:44:39.326]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:44:39.446 --> 01:44:41.287]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:44:41.587 --> 01:44:46.371]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:44:46.731 --> 01:44:51.495]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[01:44:58.715 --> 01:45:05.018]  Why is drinking pure high alkaline pH water the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[01:45:05.419 --> 01:45:11.522]  Because alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[01:45:11.802 --> 01:45:17.805]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[01:45:18.145 --> 01:45:23.048]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[01:45:23.528 --> 01:45:31.373]  Using AlkaVision pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[01:45:31.693 --> 01:45:35.836]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to an alkaline level.
[01:45:36.296 --> 01:45:40.019]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[01:45:40.959 --> 01:45:43.922]  Mike Adams will be with us until we go to break in the next segment, next hour.
[01:45:43.942 --> 01:45:44.782]  Then we're going to get
[01:46:10.435 --> 01:46:17.860]  The proprietor of the former Austin Gun Show on briefly to talk about the protests coming up tonight that I'm news blitzing for the rest of the show.
[01:46:19.710 --> 01:46:24.852]  NaturalNews.com is the powerful website of our guest, the health ranger, Mike Adams.
[01:46:25.192 --> 01:46:26.433]  Mike, let's go to phone calls.
[01:46:27.033 --> 01:46:37.537]  Let's go ahead, and by the way, I have a Wall Street Journal article here about poison and progress, about secret poisoning of the food supply, but they say Al-Qaeda will do it, and that they'll do it with slow-kill weapons.
[01:46:38.058 --> 01:46:39.398]  Jaron just printed this off for me.
[01:46:39.738 --> 01:46:41.979]  The government or the terrorists, folks, they're the ones poisoning you.
[01:46:42.399 --> 01:46:45.541]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Daryl in Texas.
[01:46:45.581 --> 01:46:46.521]  Daryl, you're on the air.
[01:46:47.742 --> 01:46:48.742]  Hello, appreciate y'all.
[01:46:50.155 --> 01:46:52.476]  I have a question about nutrition.
[01:46:52.496 --> 01:47:04.319]  I have so many questions to ask, but I think the one that I want to ask most is about nutrition, and that is, there are many superfoods, multivitamins, smoothies, and that sort of thing that are on the market.
[01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:15.102]  What is your advice for someone who is, as a pharmacist, I'm semi-educated about the body and that sort of thing, but if I'm going to set out to find
[01:47:16.025 --> 01:47:29.032]  Uh, the best way to, uh, like a reference or something that I can go to, uh, should someone be doing more, like, if you're taking a multivitamin and you're incorporating vegetables, uh, in every meal, how much more do you need?
[01:47:29.052 --> 01:47:30.132]  Do you need the superfoods?
[01:47:30.172 --> 01:47:34.054]  What are the... Well, I mean, Mike's gonna tell you, eat raw foods, but Mike, tell him.
[01:47:35.455 --> 01:47:44.860]  Well, no, I'm not, I'm not a total raw foodist myself, but I do eat some portion raw at every meal for a number of reasons, but, you know, you gotta realize that
[01:47:45.643 --> 01:47:47.805]  Number one, our food supply is depleted of nutrients.
[01:47:48.106 --> 01:47:54.512]  Even if it's fresh produce right out of the garden, most of the soils are depleted, so we're not getting the minerals that we get.
[01:47:54.833 --> 01:47:57.496]  And the processed food, of course, is complete garbage.
[01:47:57.556 --> 01:47:59.057]  Minerals are key, aren't they?
[01:48:00.639 --> 01:48:06.065]  Absolutely, and trace minerals like selenium are very important for things like cancer prevention.
[01:48:06.696 --> 01:48:10.337]  But in terms of going, how do you decide that you have a quality source?
[01:48:10.377 --> 01:48:19.141]  Well, you've got to do your research, because even though I'm as much an advocate of vitamins and nutritional supplements, there are bad vitamins and there are good vitamins.
[01:48:19.221 --> 01:48:22.742]  Because some of the vitamins are made by the drug companies, and they're just full of chemicals.
[01:48:23.262 --> 01:48:24.422]  And you've got to know the difference.
[01:48:24.462 --> 01:48:33.946]  Yeah, they make synthetic chemical copies from the extra petrochemical fluvium they have, and it's incredibly toxic.
[01:48:34.998 --> 01:48:38.362]  You wouldn't believe where some of this stuff comes from, like petrochemical byproducts.
[01:48:38.543 --> 01:48:39.664]  Well, here's a quick example.
[01:48:39.704 --> 01:48:41.386]  Here's a quick example of people that don't believe me.
[01:48:42.548 --> 01:48:47.714]  Every time I see somebody drinking a Diet Coke, I say, you know, that's genetically engineered E. coli feces.
[01:48:48.535 --> 01:48:53.141]  I mean, that's what aspartame is, is bacteria feces, and people just can't believe that.
[01:48:53.181 --> 01:48:53.642]  Go ahead, Mike.
[01:48:54.531 --> 01:48:55.432]  No, well, you're right.
[01:48:55.472 --> 01:48:59.894]  It's a good different point of view on where that stuff really comes from.
[01:48:59.974 --> 01:49:04.117]  But yeah, there are good quality supplements out there and bad quality.
[01:49:04.357 --> 01:49:11.221]  For example, if you're trying to look at a vitamin and you want to know if it's good quality, if it's a multi, look at the form of a vitamin B12 that's in the bottle.
[01:49:11.562 --> 01:49:15.564]  If it's cyanocobalamin, that's like a cyanide molecule.
[01:49:16.124 --> 01:49:17.225]  Cyano is the prefix.
[01:49:17.665 --> 01:49:18.366]  Then it's the cheap
[01:49:19.006 --> 01:49:34.501]  And in my opinion, the unhealthy version of vitamin B12, and that's what you find in most supplements, the healthy version is typically called methylcobalamin, M-E-T-H-Y-L, and that is a methylated version of that molecule that's more absorbable by your body.
[01:49:34.521 --> 01:49:39.326]  That's just one small example, but there are many others that you can learn just by doing some research.
[01:49:39.386 --> 01:49:41.088]  Alright, Daryl, I hope that answers your question.
[01:49:41.248 --> 01:49:43.170]  Andrew in Maine, you're on the air with Mike Adams.
[01:49:45.285 --> 01:49:45.605]  Hello?
[01:49:46.126 --> 01:49:46.386]  Yes.
[01:49:46.806 --> 01:49:47.086]  Hello.
[01:49:47.507 --> 01:49:48.788]  It's a great show, Alex.
[01:49:49.308 --> 01:49:49.649]  Thank you.
[01:49:50.049 --> 01:49:53.692]  And Mike's articles are really great.
[01:49:53.832 --> 01:49:59.937]  I really feel vindicated hearing how he's exposed the flu scam.
[01:49:59.957 --> 01:50:02.799]  It's very surprising how it fell apart.
[01:50:03.019 --> 01:50:12.967]  The people here lined up from the propaganda, and the children didn't want it, but the parents knew in their heart they didn't want it, but they did it anyway.
[01:50:13.768 --> 01:50:14.669]  But my question is,
[01:50:16.528 --> 01:50:22.494]  Uh, whether or not they will still try to, uh, have a engineered flu.
[01:50:22.514 --> 01:50:27.279]  And that was one of the concerns that we had along the way.
[01:50:27.299 --> 01:50:29.281]  It was really surprising the way it fell apart.
[01:50:30.302 --> 01:50:31.403]  Andrew in Maine.
[01:50:32.123 --> 01:50:32.924]  Any other questions?
[01:50:35.266 --> 01:50:36.387]  We'll answer your question.
[01:50:36.407 --> 01:50:37.769]  We'll answer your question when we come back.

[01:51:51.385 --> 01:51:53.306]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:51:53.786 --> 01:51:56.548]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:52:05.301 --> 01:52:07.804]  We are now into our number four.
[01:52:07.844 --> 01:52:10.085]  Mike Adams is our guest.
[01:52:10.746 --> 01:52:11.727]  NaturalNews.com.
[01:52:11.927 --> 01:52:15.310]  I'm Alex Jones of Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:52:15.750 --> 01:52:17.612]  I meant to get to that question earlier.
[01:52:18.092 --> 01:52:23.337]  Obama last year signed an executive order preparing for basically martial law under biological attack.
[01:52:24.078 --> 01:52:26.420]  Ties into the John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:28.981]  PDD 51 and others.
[01:52:29.701 --> 01:52:36.464]  Clearly they're eyeing that as a possible next false flag and the bigger flu scare was just a drill.
[01:52:38.825 --> 01:52:42.606]  Mike Adams, they clearly are trying to set the precedent to forcibly inoculate us.
[01:52:42.986 --> 01:52:45.207]  Your comments on a stage release flu.
[01:52:45.827 --> 01:52:51.930]  This one, we have government documents where they admitted they were going to release a flu simulant of H1N1 a year before they did it.
[01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:54.391]  So it looks like this was all a test.
[01:52:54.411 --> 01:52:54.731]  Go ahead.
[01:52:55.660 --> 01:53:03.345]  Yeah, one of the theories is that this actually was the attempt to distribute a real killer pandemic, and it failed on them.
[01:53:04.605 --> 01:53:11.589]  The scientists who were engineering this virus weren't able to get it to mutate in the wild the way they wanted it to.
[01:53:11.609 --> 01:53:12.690]  That's just one theory.
[01:53:12.730 --> 01:53:14.651]  I don't know for sure if that's true or not.
[01:53:15.011 --> 01:53:20.835]  Another theory is that it was just kind of a dry run for the big one that's coming, because we know
[01:53:21.295 --> 01:53:24.796]  We know that there are, for example, military labs and U.S.
[01:53:24.856 --> 01:53:28.318]  government labs where they work on these as weapons of war.
[01:53:28.998 --> 01:53:41.102]  Yeah, BioShield, but I mean, it came out that they were developing an H1N1, quote, flu virus simulant to test spread, and there have been a bunch of top scientists say this was clearly made in a lab.
[01:53:41.122 --> 01:53:42.163]  I mean, that's mainstream news.
[01:53:44.049 --> 01:53:45.050]  Well yeah, very clearly.
[01:53:45.811 --> 01:53:53.199]  That simulant that you talked about was put out there to try to test the effectiveness of the vaccines against it, if I remember correctly.
[01:53:53.260 --> 01:53:53.520]  Yes.
[01:53:53.620 --> 01:53:55.262]  They had structured that.
[01:53:56.123 --> 01:53:58.485]  But the simulant was a weakened H1N1.
[01:54:01.836 --> 01:54:02.376]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:54:02.937 --> 01:54:09.180]  If you look at the history, and I know you know this very well, but your listeners, this may be new information to them, but the history of the U.S.
[01:54:09.460 --> 01:54:16.963]  military testing bioweapons on civilians in the United States is a very long and detailed history.
[01:54:16.983 --> 01:54:19.865]  I mean, it goes way back, and they would
[01:54:21.129 --> 01:54:21.449]  Yes.
[01:54:43.012 --> 01:54:44.113]  But people should understand this.
[01:54:44.533 --> 01:54:49.556]  The most dangerous virus in terms of a pandemic is not the one that kills you right away.
[01:54:50.216 --> 01:54:58.701]  It's the virus that you can carry without symptoms and pass on to other people for 7 to 14 days without anybody knowing that it's being spread.
[01:54:59.001 --> 01:55:01.603]  And that's usually a low mortality virus.
[01:55:02.190 --> 01:55:06.373]  Which is exactly what H1N1 was, a low mortality virus.
[01:55:06.953 --> 01:55:16.879]  And they've also engineered super viruses that trigger once your hormone levels go down that are literally a Logan's Run carousel soft kill weapon.
[01:55:18.739 --> 01:55:20.899]  You know, I call it binary vaccine.
[01:55:20.979 --> 01:55:22.540]  It's kind of like binary explosive.
[01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:31.321]  You have to have both elements in place, and then the trigger is set off, and really bad things can happen to your body in those cases.
[01:55:31.361 --> 01:55:45.584]  But yeah, you and I both know, Alex, we see this behind the scenes even, too, things that perhaps we won't even talk about publicly, but we see what they're capable of doing, and they are setting the stage, in my opinion, for something big.
[01:55:46.185 --> 01:55:50.939]  To strike the US, most likely a false flag attack involving biologicals.
[01:55:51.593 --> 01:55:52.294]  I agree with you.
[01:55:52.314 --> 01:55:56.357]  I think that's one of the main enemy operations we're focused on.
[01:55:56.398 --> 01:55:58.139]  Our eyes are peeled as sentinels.
[01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:01.762]  And the public's starting to wake up to just how wicked this government is.
[01:56:01.782 --> 01:56:03.264]  But I don't know if it's fast enough, Mike.
[01:56:03.904 --> 01:56:10.250]  I mean, people are really in for all these reporters that think it's funny and think it's cute and think that make fun of us.
[01:56:10.751 --> 01:56:12.612]  If they kill your kids, it's not our fault.
[01:56:12.653 --> 01:56:14.114]  We tried to warn you, jackasses.
[01:56:14.855 --> 01:56:16.776]  And, you know, I mean, I mean, this is not a game.
[01:56:17.597 --> 01:56:18.518]  This is not a joke.
[01:56:19.159 --> 01:56:20.160]  This is not a drill.
[01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:22.041]  We know who these people are.
[01:56:22.101 --> 01:56:27.807]  We know what they've done over and over again, and now they're gearing up to do it on a bigger scale, and people just can't believe it.
[01:56:27.847 --> 01:56:29.128]  Mike Adams, great job.
[01:56:30.429 --> 01:56:31.911]  Again, naturalnews.com.
[01:56:31.991 --> 01:56:34.754]  Thank you for the incredible work you do.
[01:56:36.212 --> 01:56:36.752]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:56:36.872 --> 01:56:39.694]  It's always a pleasure to join you and I hope to do it again sometime.
[01:56:39.854 --> 01:56:40.615]  Take care.
[01:56:41.355 --> 01:56:41.835]  Take care.
[01:56:42.376 --> 01:56:43.496]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:56:43.757 --> 01:56:44.897]  There he goes from Ecuador.
[01:56:44.937 --> 01:56:47.259]  He's escaped the main command base of the New World Order.
[01:56:48.479 --> 01:56:50.641]  But he's fighting back from a distance.
[01:56:51.181 --> 01:56:54.903]  More of your calls straight ahead and the latest on the gun grab in Austin, Texas.
[01:56:55.203 --> 01:56:55.804]  We'll be right back.
[01:56:58.442 --> 01:57:02.665]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:57:02.985 --> 01:57:03.605]  Number one.
[01:57:03.906 --> 01:57:07.068]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:57:07.328 --> 01:57:07.888]  Number two.
[01:57:08.188 --> 01:57:12.751]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:57:13.071 --> 01:57:13.532]  It's true.
[01:57:13.812 --> 01:57:18.375]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:57:18.675 --> 01:57:19.236]  Number 3.
[01:57:19.496 --> 01:57:22.799]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:57:23.099 --> 01:57:26.842]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:57:27.002 --> 01:57:27.563]  Number 4.
[01:57:27.803 --> 01:57:30.185]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:57:30.565 --> 01:57:33.968]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:57:34.248 --> 01:57:34.469]  Number 5.
[01:57:35.029 --> 01:57:38.951]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:57:39.171 --> 01:57:43.953]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:57:44.233 --> 01:57:48.255]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:57:48.395 --> 01:57:49.976]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:57:58.851 --> 01:58:01.453]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:58:01.873 --> 01:58:06.836]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:58:07.196 --> 01:58:08.937]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:58:09.237 --> 01:58:14.060]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:58:14.241 --> 01:58:15.201]  How much do you want?
[01:58:15.421 --> 01:58:16.182]  When do you want it?
[01:58:16.562 --> 01:58:18.143]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:58:18.443 --> 01:58:19.264]  When will you need it?
[01:58:19.504 --> 01:58:21.565]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:58:21.705 --> 01:58:22.826]  Will there be any food?
[01:58:23.046 --> 01:58:24.367]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:58:24.667 --> 01:58:26.949]  There's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[01:58:27.110 --> 01:58:29.652]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:58:29.833 --> 01:58:33.036]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:58:33.416 --> 01:58:36.920]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:58:37.241 --> 01:58:38.242]  How much will you need?
[01:58:38.482 --> 01:58:39.082]  We don't know.
[01:58:39.383 --> 01:58:40.284]  How much do you want?
[01:58:40.484 --> 01:58:41.225]  All you can get.
[01:58:41.405 --> 01:58:42.226]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:58:42.486 --> 01:58:42.706]  I think.
[01:58:58.365 --> 01:58:58.986]  Hi, everyone.
[01:58:59.146 --> 01:59:00.007]  Andy Anderson here.
[01:59:00.207 --> 01:59:04.472]  Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria, and other nasties?
[01:59:04.633 --> 01:59:10.299]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day.
[01:59:10.420 --> 01:59:14.685]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, good-bye effectiveness?
[01:59:14.765 --> 01:59:16.467]  No more protection until you use it again.
[01:59:16.607 --> 01:59:17.787]  PureWorks to the rescue!
[01:59:17.948 --> 01:59:22.289]  Our FDA-compliant foam, lotion, soap, and spray do not contain alcohol.
[01:59:22.349 --> 01:59:24.410]  Their killing power lasts up to four hours.
[01:59:24.550 --> 01:59:36.434]  PureWorks Disinfecting Spray is EPA-certified to kill swine flu, bird flu, MRSA, HIV, hepatitis B and C, and for our friends in medicine, kills C. diff, along with a whole host of viruses and bacteria.
[01:59:36.574 --> 01:59:37.594]  Moles and fungus, too.
[01:59:37.614 --> 01:59:39.155]  It's even safe around pets and children.
[01:59:39.255 --> 01:59:42.336]  You'll love how your skin feels with PureWorks Soft and Supple.
[01:59:42.436 --> 01:59:43.437]  No more dry skin.

[01:59:48.198 --> 01:59:55.241]  Call now toll-free 888-245-0300 to get your hands on PureWorks and get PureWorks on your hands.
[01:59:55.361 --> 01:59:57.482]  That's 888-245-0300.
[01:59:57.522 --> 02:00:03.744]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:04.104 --> 02:00:06.385]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:00:08.394 --> 02:00:11.476]  Stop hiding in your apartments and your farmhouses.
[02:00:12.037 --> 02:00:17.701]  Come out to the Second Amendment in T-minus three hours.
[02:00:20.283 --> 02:00:25.247]  Downtown Austin, right off I-835, the west side of 8th and 7th Street.
[02:00:25.767 --> 02:00:27.068]  The Austin Police Department.
[02:00:27.128 --> 02:00:28.969]  Big, ugly, brick building.
[02:00:28.989 --> 02:00:29.810]  You can't miss it.
[02:00:30.330 --> 02:00:30.711]  Be there.
[02:00:31.271 --> 02:00:33.573]  We now have the extinct gun shows in Austin.
[02:00:33.593 --> 02:00:34.614]  The police don't allow them.
[02:00:35.783 --> 02:00:40.004]  They just come in and tell you we're going to shut you down, threaten your landlord, then lie about it later.
[02:00:41.705 --> 02:00:45.646]  I read the BATF off their own website earlier.
[02:00:47.466 --> 02:00:49.067]  Unlicensed Persons Questions.
[02:00:49.167 --> 02:00:51.707]  ATF Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
[02:00:51.967 --> 02:00:53.388]  Give me a close shot of this for everybody.
[02:00:53.408 --> 02:00:58.449]  Then I'm going to talk to Darwin Bedecker briefly about the protest tonight, then take some of your calls and news blitz.
[02:00:58.889 --> 02:01:04.571]  But for Mike and Anna and Jonathan and John and Angel, I wanted to be able to continue what they were saying with the last guest.
[02:01:05.271 --> 02:01:07.254]  I want a document cam shot of this, okay?
[02:01:07.274 --> 02:01:08.815]  This is from ATF.gov.
[02:01:09.476 --> 02:01:11.659]  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.
[02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:17.085]  To whom may an unlicensed person transfer firearms under the Gun Control Act, okay?
[02:01:17.526 --> 02:01:18.107]  This is the law.
[02:01:19.522 --> 02:01:24.925]  Q. To whom, this is section Q, to whom may an unlicensed person transfer firearms under the GCA?
[02:01:24.945 --> 02:01:25.626]  Okay?
[02:01:26.406 --> 02:01:27.347]  This is the United States.
[02:01:27.747 --> 02:01:28.247]  Federal law.
[02:01:28.828 --> 02:01:38.554]  A person may sell a firearm to an unlicensed resident of the state if he does not know or have reasonable cause to believe the person is prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms under federal law.
[02:01:40.255 --> 02:01:42.376]  And then it goes on from there to further describe it.
[02:01:42.816 --> 02:01:43.977]  And you can go read it for yourself.
[02:01:48.939 --> 02:01:49.719]  That's the facts.
[02:01:49.899 --> 02:01:57.363]  But I played the CBS news piece, and I could play News 8, I could play ABC, I could play all of them.
[02:01:57.383 --> 02:02:01.705]  We played the CBS, where they just said, it's the law, you gotta fill it out.
[02:02:01.785 --> 02:02:04.386]  The police asked them, they wouldn't, they shut it down.
[02:02:05.646 --> 02:02:13.310]  But Alex Jones and the owner of Texas Gun Shows, Darwin Bedecker, complained that it was the last group that broke the law.
[02:02:13.790 --> 02:02:14.710]  That's another hoax!
[02:02:15.591 --> 02:02:18.312]  We're saying there is no law, and they know there isn't.
[02:02:19.454 --> 02:02:24.117]  And then they just take clips of my show and edit it together to have me lie for them.
[02:02:26.818 --> 02:02:28.159]  I mean, do you see how they work?
[02:02:28.399 --> 02:02:34.802]  And... It just gets worse and worse and worse.
[02:02:34.862 --> 02:02:37.204]  So, 5 o'clock today, downtown Austin.
[02:02:37.244 --> 02:02:37.864]  You can't miss it.
[02:02:37.884 --> 02:02:40.886]  It's right off I-35 on the west side, the police building.
[02:02:40.906 --> 02:02:41.886]  You'll see the crowd be there.
[02:02:42.206 --> 02:02:44.828]  I'm gonna be there a little bit early, because the media will do the trick.
[02:02:44.868 --> 02:02:45.988]  You watch on the news tonight.
[02:02:46.008 --> 02:02:46.829]  I just know what they'll do.
[02:02:47.898 --> 02:02:49.719]  I know exactly what Glenn Beck will do before he does it.
[02:02:49.739 --> 02:02:51.000]  I know what Obama's going to do before he does it.
[02:02:51.020 --> 02:02:51.781]  I know their playbook.
[02:02:52.401 --> 02:02:55.663]  It's like I've been sitting in on all their football camp training.
[02:02:55.844 --> 02:02:57.765]  I mean, I know when they give this signal, they're doing that.
[02:02:58.325 --> 02:02:59.026]  They're going to come.
[02:03:00.327 --> 02:03:06.451]  If a bunch of people show up at 445 or so, a lot of people need to get there early.
[02:03:07.412 --> 02:03:10.814]  And you've got to kind of get together and then run out in front of the cameras.
[02:03:11.294 --> 02:03:13.056]  And I know they're going to do it anyways.
[02:03:13.096 --> 02:03:14.537]  I'm just doing this so we can expose them later.
[02:03:15.370 --> 02:03:17.471]  Because see, they don't even realize we're here.
[02:03:17.531 --> 02:03:18.472]  They don't even understand.
[02:03:18.732 --> 02:03:20.013]  They can't lie in a vacuum.
[02:03:20.253 --> 02:03:21.994]  But they'll show just a few people.
[02:03:23.115 --> 02:03:28.859]  But really, there's no way to get around their fraud, because they'll misrepresent whatever we say, whatever we do.
[02:03:29.540 --> 02:03:36.764]  The point is, we're there to let the police know, we're gonna videotape it, you should videotape it, we'll put it on YouTube, it'll reach millions of people, and that's how we do it.
[02:03:37.525 --> 02:03:43.249]  And then we'll make videos showing how the media, even if they get there when there's a big crowd, they'll show the corner of the crowd and say there were five people there.
[02:03:43.939 --> 02:03:45.039]  And then we'll expose them on that.
[02:03:45.839 --> 02:03:49.240]  Like with the Tea Parties, when there was a million in D.C., the D.C.
[02:03:49.420 --> 02:03:51.281]  Park Police said, and the media said 2,000.
[02:03:51.321 --> 02:03:54.261]  That's why the media's going bankrupt.
[02:03:54.461 --> 02:03:55.961]  That's why the newspapers are bankrupt.
[02:03:56.182 --> 02:03:58.282]  That's why nobody wants to read what they have to say.
[02:03:58.702 --> 02:04:00.542]  Because people know they're a pack of liars.
[02:04:02.163 --> 02:04:04.343]  Now, I haven't talked to him since last week.
[02:04:04.363 --> 02:04:12.525]  I don't know if you saw these newscasts that were just pure frauds, but we have them up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, but Darwin Bedecker, who just
[02:04:13.479 --> 02:04:16.980]  Through racketeering at Run Out of Town, they're now going, oh, we did have a law.
[02:04:17.940 --> 02:04:19.841]  Nuisance abatement, like it's a crack house.
[02:04:19.881 --> 02:04:21.301]  That's what we threatened H-E-B with.
[02:04:21.801 --> 02:04:23.822]  The crack house law, I've read it, doesn't apply to this.
[02:04:24.522 --> 02:04:25.663]  It's just total fraud.
[02:04:27.023 --> 02:04:32.685]  The Austin police admit, the B-A-T-F-E, told them this is part of Obama's program.
[02:04:33.205 --> 02:04:33.985]  This is Obama.
[02:04:34.025 --> 02:04:36.886]  This is the Justice Department, told Austin police to do this.
[02:04:37.786 --> 02:04:40.047]  I mean, it's horrible.
[02:04:41.198 --> 02:04:43.439]  And it sets a precedent for the entire country.
[02:04:43.459 --> 02:04:47.642]  In fact, give me the phone number of KI.
[02:04:47.882 --> 02:04:50.783]  I want people to call them and let them know we saw the piece and know they're liars.
[02:04:52.204 --> 02:04:54.145]  And give me the phone and fax.
[02:04:54.165 --> 02:04:56.747]  I want people to fax them this BATF document.
[02:04:58.187 --> 02:05:01.209]  And I also want to give out the Austin Police Department non-emergency number.
[02:05:02.670 --> 02:05:04.031]  Not 311, I know that.
[02:05:04.071 --> 02:05:06.652]  I want to give out their regular number.
[02:05:06.972 --> 02:05:07.453]  No, you know what?
[02:05:07.473 --> 02:05:08.293]  Let's go right to the top.
[02:05:08.713 --> 02:05:09.534]  City Council.
[02:05:10.379 --> 02:05:12.340]  Give me the mayor's phone number.
[02:05:14.221 --> 02:05:15.422]  The mayor's phone number.
[02:05:15.462 --> 02:05:16.123]  That's coming up.
[02:05:17.023 --> 02:05:18.404]  I better see you all out there, folks.
[02:05:18.424 --> 02:05:18.624]  Come on.
[02:05:18.644 --> 02:05:19.425]  We don't have a lot of time.
[02:05:19.725 --> 02:05:21.106]  I heard locals were planning a protest.
[02:05:21.126 --> 02:05:22.767]  I don't want it to be 15 people out there.
[02:05:22.787 --> 02:05:24.688]  I want hundreds and hundreds to come.
[02:05:24.728 --> 02:05:25.829]  If we had time, we'd have thousands.
[02:05:26.549 --> 02:05:28.090]  I mean, I just heard about this last night.
[02:05:28.470 --> 02:05:29.051]  I'm going to be there.
[02:05:29.691 --> 02:05:30.451]  Believe me, I got work.
[02:05:30.491 --> 02:05:31.192]  Pile of the Raptors.
[02:05:31.212 --> 02:05:35.194]  I'm going to come back and work on Police State 4, the rise of FEMA after this event tonight.
[02:05:37.196 --> 02:05:39.017]  Won't be any good time going to a restaurant for me.
[02:05:40.134 --> 02:05:41.515]  Because we've got to fight for this republic.
[02:05:41.815 --> 02:05:44.176]  Alright, going to Darwin Bedecker.
[02:05:44.596 --> 02:05:46.236]  Darwin, did you see the local newscast?
[02:05:47.397 --> 02:05:48.838]  I have seen some of them, Alex, yes.
[02:05:49.538 --> 02:05:50.338]  What did you think of it?
[02:05:51.118 --> 02:05:52.459]  I was kind of sickened by it.
[02:05:53.479 --> 02:05:54.920]  I haven't really watched any other one.
[02:05:57.501 --> 02:05:59.102]  Well, I just read the BATF.
[02:05:59.162 --> 02:06:00.042]  I just read the law.
[02:06:00.462 --> 02:06:02.503]  Maybe we should hand copies of this out to the cops.
[02:06:03.523 --> 02:06:05.224]  I think that would be a good idea, absolutely.
[02:06:07.565 --> 02:06:09.646]  Well, what's this been like for you, being run out of business?
[02:06:10.592 --> 02:06:12.053]  Well, I mean, it's horrible.
[02:06:12.073 --> 02:06:14.574]  I mean, I only have, you know, two show locations.
[02:06:14.634 --> 02:06:15.294]  Now I have one.
[02:06:15.314 --> 02:06:21.117]  I am in the process of trying to find a new building in Austin because I'm not going to let them win.
[02:06:21.737 --> 02:06:26.039]  But, I mean, financially, you know, it's, you know, cut my business in over half.
[02:06:26.119 --> 02:06:28.220]  Austin was a good show for me.
[02:06:28.420 --> 02:06:30.141]  You know, I enjoyed all the people that used to come out.
[02:06:30.921 --> 02:06:36.704]  And, you know, that whole side of my business has just, you know, gone away overnight.
[02:06:37.504 --> 02:06:38.165]  So, I mean, it's...
[02:06:39.884 --> 02:06:44.212]  It's devastating, but you know, they may have won the battle, but they haven't won the war.
[02:06:44.232 --> 02:06:46.216]  So, I mean, I'll be back.
[02:06:46.336 --> 02:06:47.718]  I'll be back and I'll find a new building.
[02:06:47.738 --> 02:06:51.405]  It'll be better, bigger and better than it was before all this.
[02:06:51.445 --> 02:06:52.767]  But then they'll come again.
[02:06:54.958 --> 02:06:57.339]  So that's why we have to rally the forces.
[02:06:57.359 --> 02:07:00.520]  You know, I was talking to a police officer in Pennsylvania.
[02:07:00.540 --> 02:07:01.880]  It was Ohio.
[02:07:02.100 --> 02:07:04.521]  He reminded me of cases a few years ago where they tried this.
[02:07:05.021 --> 02:07:12.164]  And so they just printed out handouts about your rules and that it can be a private sale, but you want to see a driver's license.
[02:07:13.324 --> 02:07:16.265]  You know, a private person that they need to show a driver's license.
[02:07:16.585 --> 02:07:19.586]  That way private citizens can do it because they're going to be running stings again.
[02:07:20.899 --> 02:07:27.701]  Yeah, and you know, my philosophy is that, you know, if you want to keep illegal aliens from buying guns at a gun show, you know, secure the border.
[02:07:28.341 --> 02:07:31.742]  You know, if you want to keep felons from buying guns at a gun show, don't let them out of jail.
[02:07:32.602 --> 02:07:37.963]  You know, they're the ones that have broke the law to come to the show, not the people that are there at the show.
[02:07:38.743 --> 02:07:40.184]  Not the law-abiding citizens.
[02:07:40.204 --> 02:07:44.585]  This is a swap meet, and they're going to get rid of the right for a father to give his son his gun.
[02:07:44.605 --> 02:07:46.005]  That's what these bills say.
[02:07:48.205 --> 02:07:49.806]  Yeah, and it's a crock.
[02:07:51.135 --> 02:08:01.622]  It's frustrating but you know that when you have a bunch of people that are just yes men and you know any order that they're given they just follow without you know without thought to what's right or wrong.
[02:08:01.682 --> 02:08:02.482]  I mean it's frustrating.
[02:08:03.163 --> 02:08:08.546]  Well I didn't know you'd broken your collarbone a few weeks ago but you're still going to be up here in Austin today.
[02:08:08.566 --> 02:08:09.807]  You're coming up from San Antonio.
[02:08:10.428 --> 02:08:15.351]  Yes sir I broke it two weeks ago in Colorado but yeah I'm still coming up there today and
[02:08:16.161 --> 02:08:23.246]  I'm not even going to wear my sling because I don't want to put on a show for people thinking that I'm playing the wimp role.
[02:08:23.286 --> 02:08:24.707]  But yeah, I'll be up there.
[02:08:25.708 --> 02:08:26.948]  You should wear your sling, man.
[02:08:26.968 --> 02:08:28.209]  You don't want to hurt your shoulder again.
[02:08:28.229 --> 02:08:29.930]  I know.
[02:08:29.951 --> 02:08:35.815]  I've broken other bones and I've blown out knees and stuff like that and nothing hurts as bad as a collarbone.
[02:08:35.835 --> 02:08:36.275]  That's weird.
[02:08:36.995 --> 02:08:37.876]  Were you skiing?
[02:08:38.757 --> 02:08:43.620]  Yeah, I was snowboarding and that's why fat boys don't belong on snowboards.
[02:08:45.277 --> 02:08:47.018]  Now, did you sign a license to do that?
[02:08:47.078 --> 02:08:48.339]  Maybe we should ban snowboarding?
[02:08:48.740 --> 02:08:56.425]  No, I didn't sign a license or a waiver, and believe it or not, there were people out there protesting against snowboarding, so it was kind of funny.
[02:08:58.026 --> 02:09:01.789]  Well, life is dangerous, freedom is dangerous, but tyranny is a lot more dangerous.
[02:09:02.770 --> 02:09:04.791]  And we're going to be standing beside you today.
[02:09:05.132 --> 02:09:06.873]  Hopefully you can get there by 5 o'clock, my friend.
[02:09:07.694 --> 02:09:08.714]  I'll be there about 4.30.
[02:09:10.496 --> 02:09:13.198]  Well, that's good, because the media is going to be sneaking around out there.
[02:09:14.471 --> 02:09:17.675]  Yeah, I know they will, but I'm bringing some friends up from San Antonio.
[02:09:17.715 --> 02:09:22.381]  Some are current police officers here in San Antonio, some are ex-police officers.
[02:09:23.022 --> 02:09:26.166]  So, you know, I'm bringing some support down from San Antonio.
[02:09:26.226 --> 02:09:30.412]  Everybody that thinks, you know, what happened, and they know me personally, they know what kind of person I am.
[02:09:31.292 --> 02:09:33.613]  They're going to be there to show their support also.
[02:09:34.314 --> 02:09:34.914]  Well, good.
[02:09:34.994 --> 02:09:39.876]  And we do need to remember that, again, I've seen the national poll of law enforcement.
[02:09:40.036 --> 02:09:41.837]  98% are against gun control.
[02:09:41.857 --> 02:09:42.577]  They're not stupid.
[02:09:42.877 --> 02:09:44.178]  It's the leadership that's bad.
[02:09:44.498 --> 02:09:45.899]  It's not the rank and file officer.
[02:09:46.359 --> 02:09:47.680]  They absolutely hate what's happening.
[02:09:48.980 --> 02:09:49.500]  Absolutely.
[02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:53.022]  And if I could, I'd like to be able to mention our website again.
[02:09:53.322 --> 02:09:59.105]  We got it up and running to where people want to feel like they want to donate towards a cause for the legal actions that are going to come.
[02:10:00.338 --> 02:10:02.919]  And you are going to carry out legal actions if you get the money?
[02:10:03.679 --> 02:10:04.240]  Absolutely.
[02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:05.280]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:10:05.540 --> 02:10:06.560]  I mean, it needs to be done.
[02:10:06.580 --> 02:10:10.542]  I'm just not in a position to where, you know, I can go at it, you know, alone.
[02:10:11.782 --> 02:10:12.363]  Absolutely.
[02:10:12.403 --> 02:10:13.263]  Give us the website.
[02:10:14.263 --> 02:10:18.305]  It's www.texasgunshows.net.
[02:10:19.825 --> 02:10:21.246]  Texasgunshows.net.
[02:10:21.266 --> 02:10:22.666]  You also have a petition up there.
[02:10:22.706 --> 02:10:23.427]  Tell us about that.
[02:10:24.007 --> 02:10:26.068]  Yeah, the petition we're doing is an online petition.
[02:10:26.088 --> 02:10:26.768]  We're going to try to get
[02:10:27.623 --> 02:10:30.925]  Uh, hopefully 150,000 signatures on there.
[02:10:30.946 --> 02:10:31.646]  We're on our way.
[02:10:31.966 --> 02:10:34.868]  And as soon as we reach that goal, we're going to submit it to the Attorney General.
[02:10:36.089 --> 02:10:39.552]  And that's to have the Attorney General crack down on these lawless people here in Austin?
[02:10:40.392 --> 02:10:40.712]  Yes, sir.
[02:10:43.074 --> 02:10:44.415]  Well, this is a big issue.
[02:10:44.655 --> 02:10:47.557]  And I hope they know Debra Medina is looking at bringing it up in the debate.
[02:10:48.278 --> 02:10:50.319]  So, uh, this is becoming a bigger and bigger issue.
[02:10:50.359 --> 02:10:54.302]  And just because they had KI lie for them, I mean, that's only going to make this worse for them.
[02:10:55.472 --> 02:11:13.818]  Well, you know, I saw the clip of when the gentleman questioned Rick Perry at his junket there at that gun range, and it was kind of disheartening and sickening at the same time when he asked him, you know, straight out, you know, how do you feel about, you know, what happened to the gun show, and what do you suggest?
[02:11:13.858 --> 02:11:22.061]  And his first words were, you know, he should find another venue, like, you know, like he was just going to brush it off to the side, but then the gentleman kept on
[02:11:22.984 --> 02:11:23.945]  I don't think so.
[02:11:45.650 --> 02:11:47.451]  Rick Perry question on Austin Gun Show.
[02:11:47.491 --> 02:11:48.331]  This gets better and better.
[02:11:48.591 --> 02:11:49.851]  Send it to Paul Watson, Curt Nemo.
[02:11:49.891 --> 02:11:51.451]  Let's get it up on Infowars.com.
[02:11:51.852 --> 02:11:56.013]  I'll see you in about two and a half hours, my friend, here in Austin.
[02:11:56.633 --> 02:11:57.113]  Sounds good.
[02:11:57.133 --> 02:11:58.133]  I appreciate it.
[02:11:58.773 --> 02:12:02.054]  America is in deep, deep trouble because we don't know our rights.
[02:12:02.374 --> 02:12:08.596]  Let's get real freedom back into America by teaching and promoting the Bill of Rights with the 2010 Freedom Calendar.
[02:12:08.816 --> 02:12:09.076]  Why?
[02:12:09.296 --> 02:12:11.136]  Because our forefathers gave them to us.
[02:12:11.316 --> 02:12:14.337]  Because the Freedom Calendar is true patriotism in action.
[02:12:14.617 --> 02:12:18.819]  And because if you don't know your rights and use them, you may lose them.
[02:12:19.039 --> 02:12:22.481]  The Freedom Calendar is the best educational tool in over 200 years.
[02:12:22.701 --> 02:12:28.304]  It shows in detail how to use your rights, how to answer any bureaucrat, how to use your guaranteed rights for true freedom.
[02:12:28.444 --> 02:12:35.347]  The Freedom Calendar is the easy way to learn the proper use and function of each of our rights, and is perfect for homeschoolers, business promotions,
[02:12:35.367 --> 02:12:35.848]  I think so.
[02:12:59.873 --> 02:13:03.503]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:13:03.904 --> 02:13:06.892]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:13:07.153 --> 02:13:08.556]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:13:09.258 --> 02:13:11.919]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:13:11.939 --> 02:13:18.160]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:23.361]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:13:23.502 --> 02:13:33.484]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:13:33.604 --> 02:13:35.726]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:13:35.966 --> 02:13:37.288]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:13:37.548 --> 02:13:39.830]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:13:40.010 --> 02:13:41.852]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:13:42.132 --> 02:13:46.937]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:13:47.277 --> 02:13:52.062]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:13:52.302 --> 02:13:56.406]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:13:59.016 --> 02:13:59.856]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:14:00.036 --> 02:14:05.398]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:14:05.578 --> 02:14:05.999]  I get it.
[02:14:06.119 --> 02:14:15.482]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:14:15.742 --> 02:14:16.922]  That's not what's happening.
[02:14:17.142 --> 02:14:21.524]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation.
[02:14:21.724 --> 02:14:23.424]  Or that the dollar wouldn't lose value.
[02:14:23.565 --> 02:14:25.405]  Or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:14:25.605 --> 02:14:28.886]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:14:29.006 --> 02:14:33.087]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:14:33.267 --> 02:14:34.848]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:14:34.868 --> 02:14:38.108]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[02:14:38.829 --> 02:14:42.450]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:14:42.650 --> 02:14:43.370]  You should, too.
[02:14:43.550 --> 02:14:44.530]  Find out what they know.
[02:14:44.710 --> 02:14:47.951]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[02:14:48.131 --> 02:14:48.791]  800-686-2237.
[02:14:48.811 --> 02:14:51.513]  800-686-2237.
[02:14:53.855 --> 02:14:56.337]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:14:58.338 --> 02:15:00.460]  A revolution in smoking is underway.
[02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:04.263]  A revolution all smokers of traditional cigarettes should know about.
[02:15:04.623 --> 02:15:07.906]  Keep listening for a special offer from PowerVapor.com.
[02:15:08.226 --> 02:15:11.989]  Standard tobacco cigarettes contain over 4,000 harmful chemicals.
[02:15:12.229 --> 02:15:16.552]  Now it's time to release yourself from the grip of big tobacco and experience
[02:15:16.732 --> 02:15:18.053]  True smoking freedom.
[02:15:18.313 --> 02:15:27.158]  PowerVapor.com is an e-cigarette with the look, feel, and smoke of a real cigarette, but with no tar, no carbon monoxide, and no bad odors.

[02:15:55.722 --> 02:15:58.004]  The smoking gun heard round the world.
[02:15:59.406 --> 02:16:04.453]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:16:05.220 --> 02:16:07.502]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:16:08.362 --> 02:16:10.744]  People can't believe the level of lying.
[02:16:10.824 --> 02:16:17.428]  They can't believe that every TV station in Austin lied and said, oh, the gun show got shut down because they were selling guns illegally.
[02:16:17.468 --> 02:16:19.930]  You can't sell guns privately when that's not the law.
[02:16:21.360 --> 02:16:23.982]  Then the police said, oh, well, we didn't threaten a nuisance abatement.
[02:16:24.042 --> 02:16:25.163]  Now they admit they did.
[02:16:25.924 --> 02:16:27.265]  They ran off the last guy.
[02:16:27.325 --> 02:16:28.566]  The new guy came in to take it over.
[02:16:28.606 --> 02:16:30.107]  They just shut him down.
[02:16:30.728 --> 02:16:33.410]  It's now a big national issue, and you've got to love it.
[02:16:33.690 --> 02:16:36.252]  I heard Rick Perry got confronted last night.
[02:16:36.393 --> 02:16:37.514]  I didn't look it up.
[02:16:37.574 --> 02:16:41.937]  I was busy taking care of my kids when I got home late at night.
[02:16:45.447 --> 02:16:46.748]  Then we pull up the video.
[02:16:46.788 --> 02:16:49.589]  It's going up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:16:50.069 --> 02:16:56.912]  And it's InfoWars.com cameraman, he also does talk radio and TV sometimes locally, Richard Reeves.
[02:16:58.533 --> 02:17:00.394]  And Richard Reeves went to Red's
[02:17:01.741 --> 02:17:12.570]  Rifle Range, where I do some shooting sometimes, nice folks, and talked to Rick Perry, and at the end Perry said, look, if they do it again in a new location, now it's harassment.
[02:17:12.610 --> 02:17:13.670]  And that's racketeering.
[02:17:13.891 --> 02:17:17.874]  When powerful people, government or mafia, do this kind of stuff, it's called racketeering.
[02:17:17.914 --> 02:17:18.654]  It's called extortion.
[02:17:18.714 --> 02:17:19.635]  It's called intimidation.
[02:17:20.476 --> 02:17:21.477]  It's very illegal.
[02:17:22.057 --> 02:17:23.999]  And when it's civil rights involved, whoo!
[02:17:24.959 --> 02:17:28.143]  Now here's the governor, Arte Cerveda, and BATF.
[02:17:28.383 --> 02:17:29.464]  Here's the governor.
[02:17:29.885 --> 02:17:35.691]  Now he hasn't gotten to the bottom of all your lies yet, but he likes a political issue to make himself look good to Texans.
[02:17:36.833 --> 02:17:42.479]  And I'm telling you, I'm telling you, your lion is catching up with you.
[02:17:42.519 --> 02:17:43.180]  Here's Rick Perry.
[02:17:46.536 --> 02:17:48.457]  I had at least one more question about the gun show issue.
[02:17:48.517 --> 02:17:49.618]  Yeah, ran on me.
[02:17:49.678 --> 02:17:50.539]  Robert explained it earlier.
[02:17:50.579 --> 02:17:54.842]  My understanding is that the gun show owner has not voluntarily given up his gun show.
[02:17:54.882 --> 02:18:04.569]  What has happened, evidently, is a combination of APD and or BATFE has gone and talked to the landlord of the building, who is supposed to be HEB.
[02:18:04.729 --> 02:18:04.909]  Right.
[02:18:05.149 --> 02:18:08.531]  And that HEB has come to the gun show owner and said, hey, your gun show is off.
[02:18:08.611 --> 02:18:09.052]  You're done.
[02:18:09.072 --> 02:18:15.336]  And my understanding is that the gun show has done nothing wrong, that they've been convicted over or anything like that.
[02:18:15.416 --> 02:18:16.496]  That's my understanding too.
[02:18:16.837 --> 02:18:18.778]  And my advice is find another venue.
[02:18:19.713 --> 02:18:20.634]  Find another venue?
[02:18:20.814 --> 02:18:20.994]  Sure.
[02:18:21.054 --> 02:18:24.277]  Is it okay that the feds come in and pressure Atlanta?
[02:18:24.397 --> 02:18:25.558]  No, I don't think that's fine at all.
[02:18:25.578 --> 02:18:32.283]  My deal is though, until we get that all cleared up, because I mean there's a lot of he said she said here that I don't know what the facts are.
[02:18:32.463 --> 02:18:32.683]  Right.
[02:18:32.844 --> 02:18:46.755]  But if the issue is HEB won't let you have that site, I'll bet you there's somebody in this city that would dearly love to say, here's what, here's what, and then go for it and if they try it again, at that particular point in time,
[02:18:47.295 --> 02:18:50.456]  I'm not a lawyer, but I gotta start saying that harassment is getting into play here.
[02:18:50.536 --> 02:18:52.837]  Well, that's harassment and pressure.
[02:18:53.897 --> 02:18:55.718]  Alright, there goes Governor Rick Perry.
[02:18:55.738 --> 02:18:59.359]  A little nicer to Richard than he was when he was on my show that time.
[02:19:00.500 --> 02:19:02.260]  Called me a big fat hog on air.
[02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:04.361]  But, hey, whatever.
[02:19:05.086 --> 02:19:14.112]  Not all of us are like twinkle toes, but look, the point is very exciting to see that because you heard the governor.
[02:19:14.592 --> 02:19:16.514]  He's saying that that's his understanding.
[02:19:16.554 --> 02:19:17.274]  He agrees with us.
[02:19:17.775 --> 02:19:23.919]  But after it gets sorted out, looks like harassment of your civil rights and of people's business.
[02:19:23.979 --> 02:19:25.700]  So this is huge news.
[02:19:26.200 --> 02:19:32.444]  This is absolutely gigantic news right now to have this going on.
[02:19:33.564 --> 02:19:36.273]  To have this, uh, to have this happening.
[02:19:37.797 --> 02:19:37.998]  So...
[02:19:39.813 --> 02:19:45.277]  This is getting more and more serious by the minute for the establishment that has been caught doing this.
[02:19:45.337 --> 02:19:48.399]  Come out today, let them know you're not putting up with it.
[02:19:48.439 --> 02:19:52.662]  I want to give you Greg Abbott, the Attorney General of the great state of Texas.
[02:19:53.463 --> 02:19:58.046]  And I want you to call Greg Abbott and I want you to tell him the facts have been found.
[02:19:59.007 --> 02:20:01.889]  It's all on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:20:01.909 --> 02:20:03.450]  The APD has now put out a press release.
[02:20:06.414 --> 02:20:11.259]  They admit to the Justice Department, told them to do this, and get the Justice Department out of Texas.
[02:20:11.360 --> 02:20:13.262]  They have no law, no statutory authority.
[02:20:13.282 --> 02:20:17.647]  512, right here in Austin, Capitol, down the street.
[02:20:17.667 --> 02:20:18.888]  512-463-2100.
[02:20:19.469 --> 02:20:22.232]  That's the Attorney General's number.
[02:20:22.512 --> 02:20:22.912]  Call them.
[02:20:22.932 --> 02:20:27.357]  Be polite, but be focused and say, you better do something about this or we're going to vote you out.
[02:20:27.978 --> 02:20:28.859]  512-463-2100.
[02:20:28.879 --> 02:20:30.340]  512-463-2100.
[02:20:33.964 --> 02:20:35.906]  Greg Abbott, go right to the top.
[02:20:35.926 --> 02:20:37.288]  We're going right to Governor Perry.
[02:20:37.708 --> 02:20:39.670]  We're going right to the Attorney General.
[02:20:39.770 --> 02:20:50.881]  Now, you call Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell, and you let him know that the city of Austin is going to have the Attorney General examining all the illegal stuff they're doing.
[02:20:51.604 --> 02:20:54.906]  And that he better get out ahead of this and apologize right now.
[02:20:55.467 --> 02:20:57.027]  And tell R. Day Cerveda to knock it off.
[02:20:57.308 --> 02:21:00.950]  Though he's got R. Cerveda vampirically running around with illegal checkpoints taking blood.
[02:21:00.970 --> 02:21:01.430]  512-974-2250.
[02:21:01.470 --> 02:21:02.731]  That's Lee Leffingwell.
[02:21:02.751 --> 02:21:02.791]  512-974-2250.
[02:21:02.831 --> 02:21:03.071]  Fax 512-974-2337.
[02:21:03.091 --> 02:21:03.892]  And fax him the BATF law.
[02:21:03.912 --> 02:21:07.174]  They've got it on their own site saying it's not illegal.
[02:21:21.974 --> 02:21:24.756]  It's Section Q. In fact, I showed that to you earlier.
[02:21:24.776 --> 02:21:25.876]  Here's Section Q right here.
[02:21:27.957 --> 02:21:34.601]  ATF, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, Explosives, Unlicensed Person, Questions to Whom May an Unlicensed Person Transfer Firearms Under the GCA.
[02:21:35.301 --> 02:21:39.083]  And you send them Section Q. Fax it to them right now.
[02:21:39.103 --> 02:21:39.143]  512-974-2337.
[02:21:39.704 --> 02:21:40.844]  And fax the Attorney General as well.
[02:21:48.832 --> 02:21:51.836]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:21:52.758 --> 02:21:55.441]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:58.206 --> 02:22:05.051]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:22:05.171 --> 02:22:06.432]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[02:22:06.452 --> 02:22:07.132]  It's very real.

[02:22:59.837 --> 02:23:03.500]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:23:03.860 --> 02:23:06.882]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:23:07.102 --> 02:23:08.523]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:23:09.224 --> 02:23:11.885]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:23:11.905 --> 02:23:18.086]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:23:18.266 --> 02:23:23.307]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:23:23.828 --> 02:23:33.450]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:23:33.570 --> 02:23:35.671]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:23:35.911 --> 02:23:37.251]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:23:37.512 --> 02:23:39.772]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:23:39.972 --> 02:23:41.813]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:23:42.073 --> 02:23:46.895]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:23:47.235 --> 02:23:52.017]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[02:23:58.900 --> 02:23:59.480]  Hi, neighbor.
[02:23:59.780 --> 02:24:05.282]  No matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply, every single one of us who have prepared will have two regrets.
[02:24:05.922 --> 02:24:11.684]  Even those who haven't wasted a single penny on Christmas, birthdays, and vacations in order to store all the food possible.
[02:24:12.404 --> 02:24:15.665]  Even those who have sold stuff and taken on part-time jobs to buy food.
[02:24:16.305 --> 02:24:19.526]  Even those who have traded their gold while it will still buy food.
[02:24:20.206 --> 02:24:23.567]  Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy and foolish.
[02:24:24.168 --> 02:24:28.669]  When folks won't be able to afford food and there won't be any food for any amount of money.
[02:24:29.410 --> 02:24:31.371]  We will still have two regrets.
[02:24:32.051 --> 02:24:35.392]  We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food sooner.
[02:24:36.052 --> 02:24:38.974]  We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food.
[02:24:39.734 --> 02:24:45.136]  Putting off emergency food preparations will be the most dangerous decision that some of us will ever make.
[02:24:45.931 --> 02:24:46.191]  Call 800-409-5633.
[02:24:46.211 --> 02:24:47.212]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[02:24:47.232 --> 02:24:47.272]  800-409-5633.
[02:24:47.312 --> 02:24:50.355]  Foreign offshore corporations are attempting to take this nation over.
[02:24:50.415 --> 02:24:52.978]  We're standing up and saying no.
[02:25:11.084 --> 02:25:14.870]  It's our birthright, it's our right as free sentient beings, and we're doing it.
[02:25:15.431 --> 02:25:15.891]  Together.
[02:25:15.911 --> 02:25:18.295]  We're gonna stand together 5 to 7 p.m.
[02:25:18.315 --> 02:25:19.657]  in front of the Austin Police Department.
[02:25:20.418 --> 02:25:22.721]  Right off 8th Street and I-35 on the west side.
[02:25:22.801 --> 02:25:24.444]  Be sure and join us today, 5 o'clock.
[02:25:24.504 --> 02:25:25.005]  I'll be there.
[02:25:26.758 --> 02:25:29.861]  I want to talk to Mike and Jonathan, John and Angel.
[02:25:29.921 --> 02:25:32.223]  I'm taking those five callers that have been holding the longest.
[02:25:32.303 --> 02:25:33.804]  Then I'm going to blitz through some final news.
[02:25:33.844 --> 02:25:34.865]  A lot of it I meant to get to.
[02:25:34.905 --> 02:25:36.326]  It's all incredibly important.
[02:25:36.346 --> 02:25:38.508]  I've got a bunch of huge guests throughout the week.
[02:25:39.168 --> 02:25:40.429]  There's just so much happening.
[02:25:40.489 --> 02:25:47.996]  But this federal power grab that affects every gun show, every gun owner, every private transfer of firearms is so important.
[02:25:48.016 --> 02:25:49.217]  We've been spending a lot of time on it.
[02:25:50.407 --> 02:25:52.489]  And the people are on the march right now.
[02:25:53.150 --> 02:25:54.471]  The people are waking up.
[02:25:54.952 --> 02:25:57.334]  Look at how what happened in Massachusetts to Kennedy's seat.
[02:25:57.834 --> 02:25:59.997]  I mean, globalists know the people are angry.
[02:26:00.017 --> 02:26:01.738]  That's why Rick Perry's talking like me now.
[02:26:02.119 --> 02:26:03.040]  Glenn Beck's doing it.
[02:26:04.101 --> 02:26:05.902]  The problem is they've got to hold their feet to the fire.
[02:26:06.163 --> 02:26:09.386]  Look at how Deborah Medina is surging in all the polls now.
[02:26:09.646 --> 02:26:11.108]  They weren't going to let her in the next debate.
[02:26:11.128 --> 02:26:12.569]  People started boycotting Melo.
[02:26:12.589 --> 02:26:13.130]  They let her in.
[02:26:14.821 --> 02:26:16.562]  Because she's surging in the polls.
[02:26:16.662 --> 02:26:19.883]  This is really happening, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:26:20.483 --> 02:26:25.765]  And people are discovering, like George Washington and Trenton, with that one little victory, that we can win!
[02:26:25.785 --> 02:26:27.946]  That resistance is victory!
[02:26:30.529 --> 02:26:33.352]  I'm going to go to your calls here in just a moment.
[02:26:33.412 --> 02:26:34.914]  First, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors.
[02:26:34.954 --> 02:26:36.856]  The sponsors that make this radio show possible.
[02:26:36.936 --> 02:26:42.162]  My online video, Patriot Apparel Store at Infowars.com.
[02:26:42.462 --> 02:26:43.984]  Have the tools to wake people up.
[02:26:44.024 --> 02:26:45.725]  The tools to meet like-minded people.
[02:26:46.346 --> 02:26:47.487]  Wearing your colors when you're out.
[02:26:48.388 --> 02:27:01.113]  And the tools to support this operation that is so successful and so effective because we're bonafide, we're real, we love passion, we're teaching people there are good guys, that we can win, that we can take action together, that we do have power.
[02:27:01.593 --> 02:27:03.914]  Support the InfoWar at InfoWars.com.
[02:27:04.195 --> 02:27:09.117]  You can get deals where you buy one video, get another free or one-half price, buy a video, get a free t-shirt.
[02:27:09.697 --> 02:27:12.118]  All these different selections, InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:27:17.856 --> 02:27:20.978]  Now, I want to tell you about MySolarBackup.com.
[02:27:21.218 --> 02:27:24.420]  Have you lost your power and wanted to flip a switch and get the lights back on?
[02:27:25.120 --> 02:27:31.644]  If so, you should check out MySolarBackup.com because there's never been a better time to start getting off the grid and generate your own supply of electricity.
[02:27:32.005 --> 02:27:32.545]  Here's why.
[02:27:32.845 --> 02:27:35.467]  Plug-and-play solar generators are now available, you know, for the last year.
[02:27:35.487 --> 02:27:36.187]  Our listeners love them.
[02:27:36.527 --> 02:27:42.011]  From solutions from science, these portable power systems need no installation and supply household current whenever they're needed.
[02:27:42.771 --> 02:27:46.513]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so take action today.
[02:27:46.533 --> 02:27:46.814]  And lastly,
[02:28:13.888 --> 02:28:18.532]  I had a reporter last night again talking to me and he was like, so you really believe in being prepared?
[02:28:18.552 --> 02:28:19.712]  You really believe in storable food?
[02:28:19.732 --> 02:28:21.654]  And I said, well yeah, I've got a whole bunch of it myself.
[02:28:22.455 --> 02:28:26.498]  There could be a depression, a war, a bio-release, the government hoards food and weapons.
[02:28:27.078 --> 02:28:29.200]  I mean, I do that because I want to be secure.
[02:28:29.260 --> 02:28:31.241]  I want to provide for my little ones and my wife.
[02:28:32.042 --> 02:28:32.942]  The old timers did it.
[02:28:33.003 --> 02:28:34.364]  We just have been domesticated.
[02:28:34.824 --> 02:28:35.845]  I'm not domesticated.
[02:28:36.789 --> 02:28:38.490]  I'm like a squirrel that buries some nuts!
[02:28:39.191 --> 02:28:42.833]  And these are the highest quality... I mean, look at their website, from PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[02:28:43.313 --> 02:28:51.238]  I mean, they've got ready-to-eat meals, gourmet, super inexpensive, going directly to the person that manufactures it, people that prepare it all.
[02:28:51.258 --> 02:28:53.499]  They're just wonderful folks, and they're patriots.
[02:28:53.559 --> 02:28:55.801]  They're the real deal, the people you need to get your storable foods from.
[02:28:55.921 --> 02:28:56.961]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:28:57.182 --> 02:28:59.103]  That's eFoodsDirect.com, or give them a call at 800-409-5633.
[02:28:59.123 --> 02:28:59.163]  800-409-5633.
[02:29:04.631 --> 02:29:07.473]  Okay, let's sing now through your calls quickly.
[02:29:07.833 --> 02:29:10.435]  So I want to talk to you, but I got other stuff we got to cover here.
[02:29:12.396 --> 02:29:13.877]  Let's go to Mike in Jersey.
[02:29:13.897 --> 02:29:14.678]  You're on the air, Mike.
[02:29:15.818 --> 02:29:18.420]  Alex, big time, long time listener, first time caller.
[02:29:18.500 --> 02:29:19.581]  I appreciate everything you're doing.
[02:29:20.241 --> 02:29:20.662]  Two things.
[02:29:20.722 --> 02:29:25.425]  Number one, we need to wake the people up in the northeast of the United States.
[02:29:25.745 --> 02:29:28.847]  You've penetrated all the other parts of the country, pretty much.
[02:29:29.406 --> 02:29:33.149]  Well, I mean, he doesn't want to get sued, so it's a textbook with all their own documents.
[02:29:33.169 --> 02:29:34.410]  I mean, it's what they say.
[02:29:55.294 --> 02:29:56.335]  Yeah, it's such an easy read.
[02:29:56.695 --> 02:30:06.101]  But yet, when you hear about the problems with ARPOD Pusai and Shapara and what they went through, I can't believe that people don't realize the nutricide that's going on.
[02:30:06.421 --> 02:30:15.006]  I would love for you to take five days... Yeah, you just mentioned scientists who were making millions a year running giant firms and said, my God, half the rats are dying.
[02:30:15.286 --> 02:30:16.047]  This is deadly.
[02:30:16.167 --> 02:30:17.948]  And they said, shut up, it goes to the people.
[02:30:18.748 --> 02:30:21.490]  Right, between the new leaf potatoes and the flavor-savory tomatoes.
[02:30:22.006 --> 02:30:22.727]  Are you kidding me?
[02:30:22.747 --> 02:30:23.368]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:30:23.388 --> 02:30:24.529]  40% of the rats died.
[02:30:24.549 --> 02:30:25.390]  Let's go ahead and approve it.
[02:30:25.750 --> 02:30:26.631]  Well, more than that.
[02:30:26.672 --> 02:30:29.034]  Well, 40 died pretty much immediately.
[02:30:29.054 --> 02:30:32.218]  The others had degenerative and it reduced their lifespans by half.
[02:30:32.238 --> 02:30:33.059]  I'm going from memory.
[02:30:33.279 --> 02:30:34.821]  So that's basically a soft kill weapon.
[02:30:35.642 --> 02:30:37.004]  Right, and it had the lesions in the stomach.
[02:30:37.464 --> 02:30:40.067]  What I would love for you to do, if you can... Which they now call crones.
[02:30:40.327 --> 02:30:41.449]  Everybody's getting crones.
[02:30:42.611 --> 02:30:42.791]  Right.
[02:30:43.151 --> 02:30:54.379]  If you could have five days with the nutricide side of it, with Dr. Rima Laibo, maybe Dr. Jeffrey M. Smith, maybe having the Mike Ranger back on, five days of the nutricide aspect of it, because I really think
[02:30:55.034 --> 02:30:56.975]  Besides, they're coming from us from all different fronts.
[02:30:57.235 --> 02:31:02.838]  The food aspect is going to be the most important, because if they can damage us from the inside, we're not going to be able to fight.
[02:31:02.978 --> 02:31:03.438]  I agree.
[02:31:03.638 --> 02:31:03.999]  I agree.
[02:31:04.019 --> 02:31:05.980]  In fact, since you mentioned that, I appreciate your call.
[02:31:06.960 --> 02:31:08.821]  Guys, give me a document cam shot, please.
[02:31:08.841 --> 02:31:17.885]  I want to show PrisonPlanet.tv viewers this, but for radio listeners, just go to the search engine and type in Poison and Progress, Wall Street Journal.
[02:31:19.346 --> 02:31:24.269]  And this is talking about terrorists and criminals, how they can put soft kill
[02:31:25.424 --> 02:31:50.677]  chemicals into your food and kill you months if not years like one way they've been thousands of murders it's come out the last few decades mainly women women like to poison in criminology men do it too but men generally kill people more often than women it's many times more often uh... but women generally poison and uh... and it talks about that and they've slowly put
[02:31:51.687 --> 02:31:55.830]  Small amounts of antifreeze in your drinks.
[02:31:55.890 --> 02:31:56.571]  You can't taste it.
[02:31:56.591 --> 02:31:57.291]  It's actually sweet.
[02:31:58.632 --> 02:31:59.753]  Poison and progress.
[02:31:59.793 --> 02:32:11.922]  Modern science raced to stay ahead of global terrorists and political assassins began with some devious poisoners in the 19th and early 20th centuries.
[02:32:13.644 --> 02:32:19.048]  My guess was one of the most successful poison killers to belong to the era historians call the Golden Age of Poisoning.
[02:32:19.807 --> 02:32:23.811]  And it goes into how a woman would put something in your beer that would kill you a month later.
[02:32:24.311 --> 02:32:26.894]  And thus began a deadly cat and mouse game.
[02:32:26.974 --> 02:32:29.456]  In 2005, the National Academy of Sciences warned the U.S.
[02:32:29.516 --> 02:32:31.398]  milk supply was vulnerable target.
[02:32:32.642 --> 02:32:37.626]  Folks, the FDA, everybody's dying in China, dying here, so they just said, you know what?
[02:32:37.766 --> 02:32:42.530]  We're not going to get the melamine, the liquid plastic out of your food that destroys your kidneys and liver.
[02:32:43.010 --> 02:32:47.594]  We're just going to say, in small amounts it's okay, but it's cumulative and it's in 90%.
[02:32:48.515 --> 02:32:50.056]  In fact, people won't believe it.
[02:32:50.076 --> 02:32:53.119]  Google, 90% of formula had melamine.
[02:32:54.127 --> 02:32:56.068]  Give me that, for viewers.
[02:32:56.228 --> 02:32:57.308]  People won't believe it until they see it.
[02:32:58.189 --> 02:33:01.430]  And then the FDA says, melamine not bad for you.
[02:33:01.550 --> 02:33:03.811]  So, just like they say mercury's not bad now.
[02:33:03.931 --> 02:33:05.712]  Oh, you found out we're putting mercury in?
[02:33:06.072 --> 02:33:07.392]  It's not bad, it's good.
[02:33:07.733 --> 02:33:09.313]  Oh, you found out melamine's killing people?
[02:33:09.553 --> 02:33:11.534]  Don't listen to the Chinese with thousands dying.
[02:33:11.914 --> 02:33:13.355]  No, it's good for your baby.
[02:33:13.795 --> 02:33:14.576]  There you go.
[02:33:14.616 --> 02:33:16.096]  Go to sleep.
[02:33:16.757 --> 02:33:18.278]  Go to sleep.
[02:33:18.798 --> 02:33:22.560]  Go to sleep, little baby.
[02:33:22.580 --> 02:33:24.421]  La la la.
[02:33:24.781 --> 02:33:26.482]  Take your mercury shot.
[02:33:26.902 --> 02:33:29.444]  Eat your Monsanto corn too.
[02:33:30.464 --> 02:33:42.010]  Yeah, Health Ranger article came up.
[02:33:42.070 --> 02:33:43.351]  That was actually in the Associated Press.
[02:33:43.371 --> 02:33:47.132]  90% of US infant formula may be contaminated with melamine.
[02:33:47.212 --> 02:33:50.014]  FDA abruptly declares chemicals safe for babies.
[02:33:50.314 --> 02:33:51.655]  But people won't believe Mike Adams.
[02:33:52.035 --> 02:33:53.255]  Give me an AP.
[02:33:55.396 --> 02:33:58.298]  FDA says melamine not harmful.
[02:33:59.892 --> 02:34:00.932]  And then go research Melanie.
[02:34:04.173 --> 02:34:06.273]  I mean, this is the information we know every day.
[02:34:06.313 --> 02:34:15.295]  I have to sit here and know this, and then have the mainstream media, who thinks they're part of the system, go along with it and think that we're lying about this.
[02:34:15.915 --> 02:34:17.556]  Let's go to Annie in New York.
[02:34:17.736 --> 02:34:18.636]  Annie, you're on the air.
[02:34:18.696 --> 02:34:19.096]  Go ahead.
[02:34:19.996 --> 02:34:21.136]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:34:21.476 --> 02:34:29.118]  This is quick, and it was for Mike Adams, but as you know, here in New York, we had the state health commissioner, Richard Gaines, level a decree that all health care workers get
[02:34:29.619 --> 02:34:29.779]  They are?
[02:34:51.320 --> 02:34:55.562]  Hitler was evil, Stalin was evil, Mao was evil, Julius Caesar was evil.
[02:34:55.643 --> 02:34:58.644]  I mean, people can't believe evil crazies get in control.
[02:34:59.065 --> 02:34:59.845]  They think it's funny!
[02:35:02.867 --> 02:35:09.070]  Rick Perry's party got massive money from Merck to say, girls must take Gardasil.
[02:35:09.270 --> 02:35:12.432]  Then the death started mounting everywhere, and they had to back out.
[02:35:12.472 --> 02:35:13.853]  I mean, they're killing us, folks!
[02:35:14.253 --> 02:35:16.715]  And the average cowardly person just can't believe it.
[02:35:17.435 --> 02:35:18.655]  I mean, they just can't believe.
[02:35:18.735 --> 02:35:25.018]  I mean, I tell reporters that Cass Sunstein is calling for restricting the First Amendment, and they just don't believe it.
[02:35:25.258 --> 02:35:26.718]  I talk to reporters every week.
[02:35:27.198 --> 02:35:32.380]  I talked to like four or five newspaper magazine reporters in the last week, and just none of them can get it.
[02:35:32.760 --> 02:35:33.980]  They just cannot get it.
[02:35:34.281 --> 02:35:38.122]  They know the government's corrupt, they'll admit that, but they just can't get it.
[02:35:38.222 --> 02:35:39.262]  They can't get it.
[02:35:39.302 --> 02:35:40.503]  They don't want to get it.
[02:35:41.363 --> 02:35:44.524]  Don't they love their children enough to check into the claims I'm making?
[02:35:46.380 --> 02:35:47.244]  Well, you know what, Alex?
[02:35:47.305 --> 02:35:50.279]  I think they've put their fingers in too many pies.
[02:35:50.974 --> 02:35:56.836]  Or, you know, there are too many holes in the dike, the money's running out, the people are losing their sense of humor.
[02:35:56.876 --> 02:36:06.260]  They'll figure it out once, you know, like, all of these investments of the people's money in New York, the retirement funds, with thieves like Goldman Sachs.
[02:36:06.700 --> 02:36:15.724]  Oh yeah, I'm getting emails every day, and I see articles every day, going, Alex, I heard you five years ago say they changed the law to take pension funds, I didn't believe you, they just took mine.
[02:36:16.224 --> 02:36:19.265]  Oh, you're all, people out there in denial, you're gonna find out real good.
[02:36:19.645 --> 02:36:24.167]  We could have stopped him earlier, but it's going to get real painful now because you didn't wake up.
[02:36:24.407 --> 02:36:38.854]  Now, if we wake up now, we can stop a lot of the pain, but it's only going to get worse and worse and worse if people don't find their guts again and get angry and get focused and say, no, no, no.
[02:36:39.014 --> 02:36:40.115]  Annie, I appreciate your call.
[02:36:42.016 --> 02:36:44.017]  I am really wound up today.
[02:36:47.165 --> 02:36:48.186]  We're the same people.
[02:36:48.987 --> 02:36:52.370]  And all these other people saying, oh no, so it kills the rats.
[02:36:52.530 --> 02:36:52.870]  Eat it.
[02:36:53.551 --> 02:36:55.332]  Oh, so melamine's killing people.
[02:36:55.372 --> 02:36:56.053]  That's not bad.
[02:36:56.633 --> 02:36:57.394]  Mercury's not bad.
[02:36:57.434 --> 02:36:57.774]  It's good.
[02:36:58.575 --> 02:36:59.556]  Fluoride's in your water.
[02:37:00.076 --> 02:37:05.982]  Every time I talk to a reporter, they laugh at me and go, Dr. Strangelove made fun of people that think the water's poison.
[02:37:06.422 --> 02:37:07.583]  You're Jack T. Ripper.
[02:37:07.663 --> 02:37:08.904]  You want to nuke everyone.
[02:37:08.964 --> 02:37:11.266]  I'm like, no.
[02:37:11.326 --> 02:37:13.809]  All these top scientists and the head of the EPA's
[02:37:15.165 --> 02:37:16.406]  It's EPA's union.
[02:37:16.446 --> 02:37:17.807]  In fact, I keep saying get him.
[02:37:18.127 --> 02:37:19.288]  Can somebody email me?
[02:37:19.628 --> 02:37:23.271]  Because I've told my producers and it just didn't happen because they were overworked and doing a great job.
[02:37:24.652 --> 02:37:25.973]  But I had him on about two years ago.
[02:37:25.993 --> 02:37:26.813]  It was big news.
[02:37:28.795 --> 02:37:29.936]  Let's try to Google it right now.
[02:37:30.796 --> 02:37:34.799]  EPA scientists send letter to their bosses saying take fluoride out.
[02:37:35.440 --> 02:37:39.162]  EPA scientists send letter to bosses on fluoride.
[02:37:39.342 --> 02:37:39.743]  Try that.
[02:37:40.583 --> 02:37:42.143]  And it was over 90%.
[02:37:42.223 --> 02:37:49.825]  I remember the... I mean, they got most of the scientists... I want to say it was thousands, but this was two years ago.
[02:37:49.845 --> 02:37:50.385]  I want to check it.
[02:37:51.526 --> 02:38:01.488]  And I've had these scientists on, toxicologists, you name it, and they're like, oh my God, yes, we didn't know when I was going to college that we thought it was just calcium fluoride for your teeth.
[02:38:01.948 --> 02:38:03.188]  They call it fluoride.
[02:38:03.268 --> 02:38:06.289]  It's hundreds of chemicals under that name that's deadly!
[02:38:07.498 --> 02:38:09.519]  And they won't get it out of my water in Austin.
[02:38:09.860 --> 02:38:12.622]  Even if I drink filtered water, the showers have it.
[02:38:13.602 --> 02:38:18.186]  Fluoride's one of the smallest particles on the periodic chart, periodic table.
[02:38:18.266 --> 02:38:19.707]  It goes through almost everything.
[02:38:21.508 --> 02:38:24.350]  You know, again, they're playing God with everyone.
[02:38:24.470 --> 02:38:26.732]  Oh, but Bill Gates wants to help us with the vaccines.
[02:38:26.852 --> 02:38:27.932]  Oh, yes, he does.
[02:38:28.293 --> 02:38:29.373]  He wouldn't want to hurt us.
[02:38:31.995 --> 02:38:33.596]  Jonathan in Kansas, you're on the air.
[02:38:33.636 --> 02:38:33.977]  Go ahead.
[02:38:36.522 --> 02:38:39.383]  Would you mind if I got into some propaganda placement?
[02:38:40.104 --> 02:38:40.304]  Sure.
[02:38:41.544 --> 02:38:47.487]  Yeah, so I checked out that game Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.
[02:38:47.768 --> 02:38:51.009]  Right, they teach you to be the government and stage false flag attacks?
[02:38:52.070 --> 02:38:58.833]  Yes, well, that and multiplayer, they have you using AC-130s, Predator drones,
[02:38:59.537 --> 02:39:04.360]  And if you kill enough certain amount of people, you get titled genocidal.
[02:39:04.980 --> 02:39:13.285]  If you kill, uh, you get also titles saying dictator, and you get to be a riot, too.
[02:39:13.325 --> 02:39:18.648]  You get a riot shield, and if you kill people with the riot shield, it's called riot control.
[02:39:18.688 --> 02:39:19.769]  You get points from that.
[02:39:21.618 --> 02:39:23.459]  And this is how they're dehum... Yes, I've seen it.
[02:39:23.739 --> 02:39:28.922]  I think I meant to play video of it a month ago when it came out and sold $500 million worth in a week or something.
[02:39:29.302 --> 02:39:30.523]  I think it's even more than that now.
[02:39:31.183 --> 02:39:32.083]  Bigger than any movie.
[02:39:32.223 --> 02:39:33.144]  Bigger than Avatar.
[02:39:34.144 --> 02:39:40.748]  And the whole thing is simulating killing your fellow humans, and all the studies show until you don't mind seeing dead humans.
[02:39:41.068 --> 02:39:48.392]  That's why people see a puppy dog getting hurt, or it's outraged, tens of thousands of phone calls, freakouts, because we haven't dehumanized animals yet.
[02:39:48.452 --> 02:39:50.293]  We haven't been desensitized to kill animals.
[02:39:51.033 --> 02:39:56.077]  And so they put our normal paternal, maternal, fraternal instinct onto animals.
[02:39:56.477 --> 02:39:59.080]  That's the eugenicist model, but then not on humans.
[02:39:59.120 --> 02:39:59.920]  I appreciate your call.
[02:40:00.281 --> 02:40:00.901]  Okay, here it is.
[02:40:00.981 --> 02:40:02.502]  Organic Consumers Association.
[02:40:03.643 --> 02:40:07.446]  EPA scientists and workers call for an end to water fluoridation because of cancer risk.
[02:40:08.387 --> 02:40:08.647]  August 30, 2005.
[02:40:08.707 --> 02:40:09.988]  Now, that's when I did it again.
[02:40:12.878 --> 02:40:14.299]  Let's set some of these people up next week.
[02:40:14.319 --> 02:40:21.702]  Now here's the actual NTEU, the National Treasury Employees Union, why EPA headquarters union of scientists opposes fluoridation.
[02:40:22.122 --> 02:40:28.304]  I told a reporter about this yesterday and he literally looked right through me like I was a pumpkin head liar.
[02:40:30.225 --> 02:40:38.869]  Because the scientists, you know, they're not like Dr. Strangelove, they're not like General Jack T. Ripper, they know it's nutritious because nanny government only helps us.
[02:40:41.980 --> 02:40:43.122]  I just can't even handle it anymore.
[02:40:57.654 --> 02:41:01.657]  They really think we're crazy, and they're normal, and they don't understand.
[02:41:01.677 --> 02:41:02.518]  They don't know!
[02:41:04.259 --> 02:41:06.441]  Or they say, well, you're just taking the news you want.
[02:41:06.461 --> 02:41:08.002]  Well, what do you mean, the news I want?
[02:41:08.542 --> 02:41:10.884]  They've been telling us for two years the economy's gotten better.
[02:41:10.904 --> 02:41:12.585]  They've been telling us there's been a recovery.
[02:41:12.645 --> 02:41:13.546]  Absolute bull!
[02:41:14.147 --> 02:41:15.928]  The government cooks the numbers on unemployment to 10.2.
[02:41:15.968 --> 02:41:16.168]  It's 22%!
[02:41:16.228 --> 02:41:17.249]  Every major real index.
[02:41:23.188 --> 02:41:25.090]  I mean, we're being shoveled a bunch of lies!
[02:41:25.630 --> 02:41:26.331]  One more caller.
[02:41:26.851 --> 02:41:28.293]  Or try to cram in two, I don't know.
[02:41:28.953 --> 02:41:30.314]  Let's talk to John in Michigan.
[02:41:31.235 --> 02:41:31.836]  Go ahead, John.
[02:41:33.677 --> 02:41:34.418]  Alex, how you doing?
[02:41:34.438 --> 02:41:36.200]  Can you hear me?
[02:41:36.220 --> 02:41:37.261]  I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[02:41:37.281 --> 02:41:41.625]  I guess it's easy to lie to people when you're telling them what they want to hear, huh?
[02:41:42.455 --> 02:41:43.355]  Yeah, everything's fine.
[02:41:43.375 --> 02:41:44.396]  The government loves you.
[02:41:44.536 --> 02:41:46.296]  Drink your mercury.
[02:41:47.217 --> 02:41:51.318]  Never mind, half your neighbors have cancer and two kids on the block have got their hair falling out.
[02:41:51.358 --> 02:41:52.418]  Your wife's hair's falling out.
[02:41:52.458 --> 02:41:53.059]  Everything's fine.
[02:41:54.119 --> 02:41:58.240]  What's that Nazi quote that the lie can be protected only so long as they're protected?
[02:41:58.820 --> 02:42:02.762]  As long as people aren't affected by the consequences?
[02:42:02.862 --> 02:42:04.802]  I don't know what that means.
[02:42:04.902 --> 02:42:09.184]  Yeah, Joseph Goebbels in 1943, as things were collapsing, said, we can't lie anymore.
[02:42:10.097 --> 02:42:18.224]  We can't lie as much because if you can't block the lie out, it doesn't work anymore.
[02:42:19.125 --> 02:42:24.089]  And so now the media still is lying, lying, lying, though we're here exposing them and others are.
[02:42:25.130 --> 02:42:26.651]  And all we gotta do is put out the truth.
[02:42:26.931 --> 02:42:28.252]  The truth is like a virus.
[02:42:28.393 --> 02:42:29.213]  It just spreads.
[02:42:29.293 --> 02:42:30.454]  You don't have to protect it.
[02:42:30.474 --> 02:42:31.515]  You don't have to defend it.
[02:42:31.535 --> 02:42:33.437]  All you gotta do is just put it out there.
[02:42:34.696 --> 02:42:38.165]  And think as this global tyranny rises, the great awakening that's going to happen.
[02:42:38.465 --> 02:42:40.029]  People are not going to be as materialistic.
[02:42:40.390 --> 02:42:41.653]  They're going to get right with their creator.
[02:42:42.981 --> 02:42:43.581]  Think about it.
[02:42:43.881 --> 02:42:47.003]  As bad as it's going to get, it's going to serve a purpose.
[02:42:47.463 --> 02:42:48.483]  I appreciate your call.
[02:42:48.503 --> 02:42:50.504]  All right, we'll go to Angel.
[02:42:50.544 --> 02:42:54.106]  As I said, I'll hit a few stories we didn't really get to in the final segment.
[02:42:54.146 --> 02:42:58.647]  Stay the course with us, and I'll see you today, five o'clock, two hours from now.
[02:42:59.128 --> 02:43:00.388]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:43:00.428 --> 02:43:05.770]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:43:06.010 --> 02:43:07.591]  Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[02:43:07.831 --> 02:43:10.632]  Non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold.
[02:43:11.012 --> 02:43:16.094]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:43:16.594 --> 02:43:21.295]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:43:21.815 --> 02:43:23.696]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:43:24.136 --> 02:43:28.740]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[02:43:28.940 --> 02:43:29.841]  And here's the best part.
[02:43:30.061 --> 02:43:32.804]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:43:32.824 --> 02:43:36.427]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:43:36.747 --> 02:43:39.590]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:43:39.930 --> 02:43:41.832]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:43:42.152 --> 02:43:43.073]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:43:46.716 --> 02:43:48.497]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:43:49.678 --> 02:43:55.462]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:43:55.783 --> 02:43:58.224]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:44:00.266 --> 02:44:03.908]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:44:04.289 --> 02:44:07.291]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:44:07.531 --> 02:44:08.952]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:44:09.651 --> 02:44:12.312]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:44:12.332 --> 02:44:18.514]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:44:18.714 --> 02:44:23.736]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:44:23.756 --> 02:44:27.057]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:44:27.077 --> 02:44:33.879]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:44:33.999 --> 02:44:36.120]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:44:36.341 --> 02:44:37.661]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:44:37.942 --> 02:44:40.223]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:44:40.403 --> 02:44:42.245]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:44:42.525 --> 02:44:47.328]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:44:47.668 --> 02:44:56.794]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:45:00.569 --> 02:45:03.950]  If you owe money to the IRS, you can't make the problem go away by yourself.
[02:45:04.150 --> 02:45:07.731]  But with the help of Dan Pilla, you can get your problem solved once and for all.
[02:45:08.072 --> 02:45:09.032]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.

[02:45:14.574 --> 02:45:18.115]  We take a very simple but proven three-step approach to solving your problem.

[02:45:24.355 --> 02:45:30.999]  Next, we build a comprehensive plan to get your tax debt reduced to the fullest extent possible, sometimes even completely eliminated.
[02:45:31.479 --> 02:45:35.581]  And finally, we work with you every step of the way to get your problem solved once and for all.
[02:45:36.162 --> 02:45:37.542]  Call us for a free consultation.

[02:45:42.458 --> 02:45:44.740]  We'll work together to get your problem solved, guaranteed.
[02:45:45.240 --> 02:45:49.904]  Dan Pilla has been protecting taxpayers from the IRS for three decades, and he can help you, too.
[02:45:50.384 --> 02:45:51.185]  Call us today at 800-346-6829.
[02:45:51.205 --> 02:45:51.605]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX.
[02:46:05.740 --> 02:46:10.662]  I'll see you 5 o'clock, 8th and 7th Street on the west side of I-35 in front of the Austin Police Department.
[02:46:11.462 --> 02:46:14.143]  Don't procrastinate, get in your cars, get down there today.
[02:46:14.923 --> 02:46:17.684]  Let these gun grabbers know we're not putting up with them destroying our rights.
[02:46:19.345 --> 02:46:20.665]  And all their lies aren't going to work.
[02:46:20.885 --> 02:46:24.247]  You and climate change expert, there could be more errors in report.
[02:46:25.567 --> 02:46:32.950]  And then he goes on to say, well we just said this and claimed the Himalayas were all going to melt because, you can go read the quotes, because we still know there's a problem.
[02:46:34.198 --> 02:46:37.320]  So he's now admitting the lies.
[02:46:38.281 --> 02:46:46.546]  More reports on thermostats all over the world being given false numbers in a unified fraud by the UN and major universities working together.
[02:46:46.566 --> 02:46:47.687]  See, this was too big.
[02:46:47.727 --> 02:46:48.268]  It came out.
[02:46:49.688 --> 02:46:52.951]  Also, we've got James Dillingpole coming on in two days.
[02:46:53.711 --> 02:46:54.492]  London Telegraph.
[02:46:54.932 --> 02:46:58.835]  UK parliamentary investigation into Climategate may not be a whitewash.
[02:46:58.855 --> 02:47:00.336]  I mean, they're talking about criminal charges.
[02:47:02.554 --> 02:47:03.975]  There's a bunch of other news on that.
[02:47:04.035 --> 02:47:05.716]  Investigate Pachari now.
[02:47:06.156 --> 02:47:08.578]  All the money he's been making off climate fraud.
[02:47:08.598 --> 02:47:13.161]  It's just, it's just, I meant to get to all this today, but we're going to be covering it more later in the week.
[02:47:14.001 --> 02:47:16.123]  Also, look at this article.
[02:47:17.243 --> 02:47:19.525]  This was from Ammo Land.
[02:47:21.366 --> 02:47:22.987]  And I've seen these other reports.
[02:47:23.588 --> 02:47:26.630]  People will take photos of their guns for insurance and get them developed?
[02:47:27.850 --> 02:47:30.212]  And, I mean, I guess you shouldn't have your photos developed anywhere.
[02:47:31.516 --> 02:47:35.277]  People are being arrested for showing a five-year-old daughter in the pool in a bikini.
[02:47:35.337 --> 02:47:36.638]  They say that's child porn.
[02:47:37.558 --> 02:47:44.660]  This guy in Belleville, New Jersey, took photos of his guns and emailed them to Walgreens to be printed for him.
[02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.181]  And they called him up and said, these are objectionable.
[02:47:47.221 --> 02:47:47.861]  We won't print them.
[02:47:47.901 --> 02:47:51.843]  I mean, just the image of a gun in the hands of a slave will be illegal.
[02:47:51.863 --> 02:47:52.463]  I mean, ahhh!
[02:47:52.923 --> 02:47:54.063]  I've got a picture of a gun!
[02:47:54.584 --> 02:47:55.684]  There's a picture of a gun right there!
[02:47:56.144 --> 02:47:56.264]  Ahhh!
[02:47:56.984 --> 02:47:57.104]  Ahhh!
[02:47:57.525 --> 02:47:58.345]  I mean, it's...
[02:47:59.873 --> 02:48:02.914]  I'm walking down the street, it's a nice day, somebody puts a picture of a gun in front of my face.
[02:48:02.934 --> 02:48:05.975]  I have like a heart attack.
[02:48:06.696 --> 02:48:11.097]  It's like... And you actually show them a real gun, they don't know what to do.
[02:48:13.218 --> 02:48:13.638]  Amazing.
[02:48:15.039 --> 02:48:15.219]  But...
[02:48:18.942 --> 02:48:20.122]  I said I'd take a final call.
[02:48:20.182 --> 02:48:23.844]  I mean, folks, I never even get to the police brutality.
[02:48:24.264 --> 02:48:25.384]  The cops are out of control.
[02:48:25.404 --> 02:48:27.785]  They'll break people's arms who aren't even resisting.
[02:48:28.025 --> 02:48:28.765]  They'll taser them.
[02:48:28.785 --> 02:48:29.405]  They'll beat them up.
[02:48:29.465 --> 02:48:31.186]  And then they'll charge them with assaulting them.
[02:48:31.406 --> 02:48:35.607]  They'll jump on your legs with their knees and just snap them like this poor lady we're getting her on.
[02:48:35.627 --> 02:48:37.768]  And then they charge you with assaulting them.
[02:48:37.928 --> 02:48:40.909]  It's not enough you've got a compound fracture.
[02:48:40.929 --> 02:48:44.330]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[02:48:46.044 --> 02:48:47.805]  It's just... Hey, don't worry, cops.
[02:48:47.845 --> 02:48:49.166]  You think we're not human?
[02:48:49.806 --> 02:48:50.666]  Some of you bad cops?
[02:48:50.706 --> 02:48:51.947]  The government doesn't think you're human either.
[02:48:52.127 --> 02:48:53.408]  They're jacking your food and water.
[02:48:53.628 --> 02:48:54.488]  But you like it, though.
[02:48:54.508 --> 02:49:00.491]  It's the system and they give you a uniform and some power and... You're gonna... You're gonna teach us, oh yeah.
[02:49:02.271 --> 02:49:04.112]  You people have no idea what you're part of.
[02:49:04.772 --> 02:49:06.353]  Let's talk to Angel in Illinois.
[02:49:06.413 --> 02:49:07.394]  Last caller, go ahead.
[02:49:07.414 --> 02:49:10.355]  Hi, just a quick question about GMO foods.
[02:49:11.475 --> 02:49:11.796]  Yes.
[02:49:12.676 --> 02:49:14.697]  How does the typical person know
[02:49:15.270 --> 02:49:19.474]  When they're walking into a grocery store, which products are a GMO and which ones aren't?
[02:49:19.954 --> 02:49:25.979]  You can't trust the government certification because three years ago they changed the law where it can be non-organic but still say it.
[02:49:25.999 --> 02:49:28.001]  But what you really don't want is GMO.
[02:49:28.741 --> 02:49:33.525]  Unorganic's not even that bad because, you know, there's poison out there and you just got to wash it properly.
[02:49:33.986 --> 02:49:37.428]  It's the GMO, the cross species, that's really bad.
[02:49:38.169 --> 02:49:50.274]  And you just vote with your dollars and you learn the different certifications, what companies you trust, what stickers you trust, and you do research on it, your children are worth it, and you just don't buy any big brands of processed stuff.
[02:49:50.294 --> 02:49:54.696]  We all have to consciously realize this is real, this is happening.
[02:49:55.736 --> 02:49:59.718]  So they're not going to come out and put GMO on their products?
[02:50:00.373 --> 02:50:02.396]  You won't see it blatantly in front of you.
[02:50:02.416 --> 02:50:04.418]  You have to look at the companies.
[02:50:04.438 --> 02:50:06.741]  You have to go with private certifications.
[02:50:07.162 --> 02:50:13.990]  And there's a bunch of companies that do it, and the companies that grow organic then pay them to come and certify.
[02:50:14.230 --> 02:50:15.111]  You'll come and look at it.
[02:50:15.692 --> 02:50:17.153]  And so that's why there's added costs.
[02:50:17.173 --> 02:50:19.795]  They have to have certifiers that are there watching what's done.
[02:50:19.815 --> 02:50:22.256]  We have to do this because these evil globalists are poisoning everything.
[02:50:22.777 --> 02:50:23.277]  You understand?
[02:50:23.958 --> 02:50:25.499]  Don't drink fluoridated water.
[02:50:25.979 --> 02:50:27.540]  Don't eat at fast food restaurants.
[02:50:27.580 --> 02:50:28.220]  Start there.
[02:50:28.841 --> 02:50:30.342]  And don't eat the GMO corn.
[02:50:30.382 --> 02:50:33.304]  That is a particularly deadly chemical weapon.
[02:50:34.124 --> 02:50:36.606]  I'll see you downtown, five o'clock, two hours from now.
[02:50:36.806 --> 02:50:37.486]  Call everybody.
[02:50:37.566 --> 02:50:37.947]  Be there.
[02:50:40.672 --> 02:50:42.337]  Second Amendment demonstration!
[02:50:42.397 --> 02:50:43.761]  Second Amendment demonstration!
[02:50:43.781 --> 02:50:44.483]  Five o'clock!
[02:50:44.523 --> 02:50:44.944]  Be there!
[02:50:44.964 --> 02:50:46.409]  They shut our gun show down!
[02:50:46.429 --> 02:50:46.930]  Be there!
[02:50:46.950 --> 02:50:48.896]  This is Alex...
