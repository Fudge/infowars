[00:00:08.314 --> 00:00:09.815]  Alright, we're back live my friends.
[00:00:10.135 --> 00:00:11.975]  William Gein joining us in the next hour.
[00:00:12.015 --> 00:00:13.576]  I want to go back to your phone calls.
[00:00:14.996 --> 00:00:20.538]  But I wanted to play a clip one more time of Zbigniew Brzezinski making quite an admission.
[00:00:21.118 --> 00:00:27.880]  And I'm seeing similar admissions from the Rand Corporation, the UN, the Club of Rome, the State Department and others.
[00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:35.143]  That they tried to lie to the public and deny they were forming a global corporate government for the administrative convenience of central bankers.
[00:00:36.343 --> 00:00:42.364]  Which they believe is much better than the former auto-determination of nation states.
[00:00:42.745 --> 00:00:44.805]  That's basically a quote from David Rockefeller.
[00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:47.666]  I'm paraphrasing there almost word for word.
[00:00:47.686 --> 00:00:51.987]  In fact, just pull me up the David Rockefeller quote so I'm exact.
[00:00:52.307 --> 00:00:55.308]  David Rockefeller world government quote.
[00:00:55.528 --> 00:01:02.209]  There's a bunch of them, but it's the one about a world government for the administrative convenience of world bankers.
[00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.430]  Private central bankers.
[00:01:05.862 --> 00:01:07.002]  There's many variants of that.
[00:01:07.042 --> 00:01:14.565]  The point is that they would deny all this was going on forever, and now they're not denying it.
[00:01:14.905 --> 00:01:24.629]  So I want to get back into that, take your phone calls, and talk about what's happening to incumbents, both Republican and Democrat, in primaries from Utah to Pennsylvania to Kentucky.
[00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:27.690]  You name it, this is a big deal.
[00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.292]  But before I go any further here today,
[00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:40.446]  I wanted to tell you about a few of the sponsors that have made this radio broadcast possible.
[00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:43.468]  One of them is Pure Water Freedom.
[00:01:43.588 --> 00:01:45.349]  PureWaterFreedom.com.
[00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:45.969]  One word.
[00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:48.030]  I want to tell you about PureWaterFreedom.com.
[00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.192]  If you want to affordably remove fluoride from your tap water, visit PureWaterFreedom.com.
[00:01:52.513 --> 00:01:54.414]  They have a full line of household fluoride filters.
[00:01:54.674 --> 00:01:59.196]  You can even remove fluoride from every water source in your home with a whole house fluoride system.
[00:01:59.216 --> 00:02:03.899]  It's not enough to just filter your water because you breathe it and it goes through your skin in the bath or the shower.
[00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.283]  They have a wide variety of filters to remove all types of toxins from your water, including shower and bath filters.
[00:02:09.383 --> 00:02:10.744]  All their filters are made in the USA.
[00:02:11.144 --> 00:02:19.010]  Check out their banner on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com or go to PureWaterFreedom.com today to take control of your water supply.
[00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:26.375]  And continuing along the lines of being self-sufficient and beginning that long
[00:02:28.075 --> 00:02:31.900]  journey towards being off the grid, which is so important for everybody to attempt to do.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.464]  I want to tell you about MySolarBackup.com.
[00:02:34.764 --> 00:02:44.317]  If you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on, if so, you should check out MySolarBackup.com, because there's never been a better time to start getting off the grid and generate your own supply of electricity right now.
[00:02:44.918 --> 00:02:45.658]  Here's why.
[00:02:45.758 --> 00:02:51.260]  Plug-and-play generators from our great sponsor, Solutions from Science, are just wonderful systems.
[00:02:51.721 --> 00:02:57.543]  No installation needed and supply household current whenever and wherever you need it, producing electricity directly from the sun.
[00:02:57.663 --> 00:03:01.344]  Unlike gas generators, solar generator runs quietly and emits no fumes.
[00:03:01.404 --> 00:03:04.005]  Great for your house, great for your work shed or camping.
[00:03:04.445 --> 00:03:07.967]  Check them out at mysolarbackup.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:03:11.408 --> 00:03:13.950]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so take action today.
[00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:14.130]  877-327-0365.
[00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:20.916]  And you can get a bunch of these units and run your whole house, but it's good to just get started.
[00:03:21.757 --> 00:03:21.997]  Okay.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:36.070]  I cannot describe to you how big of a deal it is to have Ban Ki-moon, Secretary General of the UN, Herman Van Rompuy, unelected head of the EU,
[00:03:38.208 --> 00:03:52.639]  Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Al Gore, all these world leaders coming out and saying, we're setting up a world government based on global carbon taxes, a global constitution of the G20, controlling the planet's currencies.
[00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:58.143]  National currencies that are under the auspices and are pegged to the SDRs.
[00:03:58.624 --> 00:03:59.945]  Now why have they done that?
[00:04:01.104 --> 00:04:09.033]  This was a big thing for them in the last two years to shift from denying they were setting up oral government for the last 50 as they were setting it up.
[00:04:09.513 --> 00:04:12.236]  Thousands of their internal documents fell into our hands.
[00:04:12.457 --> 00:04:16.101]  They published many of them in scholarly reports knowing you wouldn't be reading them.
[00:04:16.441 --> 00:04:17.482]  That's how arrogant they are.
[00:04:17.983 --> 00:04:21.367]  Thinking all you care about is baseball and football and partying.
[00:04:22.947 --> 00:04:36.950]  Well, Brzezinski explains why, and I'm seeing this in more and more reports, why they've now, and of course I said this years ago, the last two years they've shifted from denying all of this to admitting that it's real because they've passed that cost-benefit point.
[00:04:37.799 --> 00:04:51.573]  Where if we lie about world government, that'll discredit us with people that find out we are setting it up, but they're such a small minority, we want to sneak up on the world population with this global corporate takeover, so we're going to go ahead and lie.
[00:04:52.314 --> 00:04:56.998]  But in the last two years, and I think a few years late, they should have done this a decade ago, they were smart,
[00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:02.581]  They went from denying it, to admitting it, and even admitting that it's authoritarian.
[00:05:02.621 --> 00:05:03.521]  Remember two years ago?
[00:05:03.541 --> 00:05:05.041]  Or about a year and a half ago?
[00:05:05.062 --> 00:05:06.642]  It's in the Obama deception.
[00:05:08.443 --> 00:05:14.185]  Scores of articles, Time Magazine, Newsweek, but especially the Financial Times of London said,
[00:05:15.518 --> 00:05:16.799]  And now for world government.
[00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:17.700]  That was the headline.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.202]  And now for world government.
[00:05:19.842 --> 00:05:21.984]  And why did they say, and now for world government?
[00:05:22.745 --> 00:05:24.807]  Well, he goes on to say, we built it quietly.
[00:05:25.127 --> 00:05:26.088]  We built it in stealth.
[00:05:26.168 --> 00:05:27.329]  Yes, it's authoritarian.
[00:05:27.609 --> 00:05:28.891]  You don't know what's good for you.
[00:05:28.951 --> 00:05:29.992]  This is to save the earth.
[00:05:32.254 --> 00:05:33.715]  And yes, the Bilderberg Group's real.
[00:05:35.297 --> 00:05:35.637]  Okay?
[00:05:37.239 --> 00:05:37.439]  So...
[00:05:39.778 --> 00:05:45.307]  Not only do they admit it's a world government, but that it's unelected and unaccountable to you because they know better.
[00:05:45.327 --> 00:05:49.214]  And then, of course, in every case they rob you with this system they've built.
[00:05:50.552 --> 00:05:57.616]  And torture and secret arrest and DNA databases is what these people put in to place in every country they control.
[00:05:57.916 --> 00:05:58.837]  They are tyrants.
[00:05:58.917 --> 00:06:00.277]  They don't want free speech.
[00:06:00.337 --> 00:06:03.919]  They don't want private property for the general public, only for themselves.
[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.700]  It's all selectively enforced.
[00:06:06.101 --> 00:06:10.503]  It's a super elite destroying anybody who has two cents to rub together.
[00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:14.380]  You have all that going on.
[00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:21.906]  And you have Zbigniew Brzezinski at a televised CFR meeting admitting there's been a global awakening to the new world order.
[00:06:22.626 --> 00:06:25.769]  The G20 is our best shot at world government, but it's infighting.
[00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:27.930]  And we already played that part of the clip.
[00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.171]  It's a long clip last hour.
[00:06:29.231 --> 00:06:33.275]  The full unedited clip is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:06:35.285 --> 00:06:39.468]  But then the first question he gets is, you know, don't we need to use the U.N.
[00:06:39.508 --> 00:06:40.349]  as a world government?
[00:06:40.369 --> 00:06:48.596]  And he goes on to explain that it's basically impotent, that yes, they want a world government, but there's no single power big enough to enforce the world government.
[00:06:48.836 --> 00:06:50.197]  So he also admits the U.S.
[00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:58.043]  is the main bulldog and the main engine of the world government, destroying our sovereignty while we're used to destroy other people's sovereignty.
[00:06:58.224 --> 00:07:04.849]  With economic warfare, with invasions, selling rebels weapons, selling neighboring countries weapons,
[00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:13.595]  State Department Random 200, where Kissinger talks about selling weapons to a neighboring country to attack the next country, to create population reduction.
[00:07:14.515 --> 00:07:15.516]  I mean, this is ruthless.
[00:07:15.996 --> 00:07:19.859]  And this is the great game where they play nations and groups and people off against each other.
[00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:22.100]  That's what racist films like Machete are about.
[00:07:22.441 --> 00:07:23.862]  Getting us all fighting with each other.
[00:07:24.282 --> 00:07:27.664]  Because if the globalists can't make us infight, they're going to lose.
[00:07:28.124 --> 00:07:31.347]  But his big admission is, the people are now awake.
[00:07:31.427 --> 00:07:34.549]  As I said two years ago, they made a decision,
[00:07:35.209 --> 00:07:37.371]  That wasn't announced, but you can see the decision.
[00:07:37.751 --> 00:07:43.176]  Suddenly hundreds of articles a week admitting it's authoritarian world government, but that it's for your own good.
[00:07:44.156 --> 00:07:44.737]  Remember that.
[00:07:46.843 --> 00:08:15.700]  for the world government and telling you it's good and yes they've been trying to set it up and poor them they're having trouble because people are awake clearly they passed that point where lying about it was only discrediting them so now they shifted into telling you okay world government is a good thing but they still think cops are dumber than the general public because they still teach police in all their training manuals that it doesn't exist and that if you talk about it the person talking about world government wants to kill cops
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.442]  It's just very elementary brainwashing.
[00:08:18.762 --> 00:08:23.486]  Hey, if you hear somebody saying there's a banking takeover, a world government, be careful, they want to kill you.
[00:08:24.687 --> 00:08:32.273]  That's in all the different ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, MIAC, Homeland Security reports that we received from law enforcement a year and a half ago.
[00:08:32.713 --> 00:08:34.115]  Now, that's all public.
[00:08:35.216 --> 00:08:35.376]  See?
[00:08:36.696 --> 00:08:50.775]  So, but they've almost completely converted over from saying it doesn't exist to admitting it exists because for the first time in history, and I agree with him, the Renaissance was only localized via the printing press.
[00:08:50.835 --> 00:08:51.676]  Again, information.
[00:08:51.956 --> 00:08:54.580]  That's what the Gutenberg press generated that.
[00:08:56.271 --> 00:09:02.836]  The other major change in international affairs is that for the first time in all of human history, mankind is politically awakened.
[00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:03.836]  That's a total new reality.
[00:09:25.968 --> 00:09:30.070]  It has not been so for most of human history, until the last 100 years.
[00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:35.831]  And in the course of the last 100 years, the whole world has become politically awakened.
[00:09:36.312 --> 00:09:52.717]  And no matter where you go, politics is a matter of social engagement, and most people know what is generally going on, generally going on in the world, and are consciously aware of global iniquities,
[00:09:53.726 --> 00:09:57.767]  Inequalities, lack of respect, exploitation.
[00:09:59.808 --> 00:10:02.348]  Mankind is now politically awakened and stirring.
[00:10:02.968 --> 00:10:17.052]  The combination of the two, a diversified global leadership, politically awakened masses, makes a much more difficult context for any major power, including, currently, the leading world power, the United States.
[00:10:21.417 --> 00:10:28.383]  I really enjoyed your presentation, but I'm wondering how would you rate the United Nations in helping solve some of the geopolitical problems we've had?
[00:10:28.743 --> 00:10:38.931]  Some people say they're, you know, they're not adding a lot of solutions, and some people even suggest we should have another organization internationally that can do the job that the United Nations should be doing.
[00:10:39.391 --> 00:10:41.313]  And even people are talking about one world governments.
[00:10:41.393 --> 00:10:43.755]  I mean, how do you view the UN right now?
[00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:47.858]  Well, you know, there should be such an organization.
[00:10:47.878 --> 00:10:49.199]  The word should implies that
[00:10:50.359 --> 00:10:55.046]  There is a kind of moral imperative or need for it.
[00:10:56.124 --> 00:10:57.204]  But it doesn't exist.
[00:10:57.504 --> 00:10:58.345]  Why doesn't it exist?
[00:10:59.005 --> 00:11:06.647]  Because we don't have a situation in which there is a concentrated source of power that has universal reach.
[00:11:07.307 --> 00:11:08.628]  Not even America has that.
[00:11:09.428 --> 00:11:16.470]  So the United Nations functions well in areas in which it is possible to generate consensus.
[00:11:17.091 --> 00:11:21.192]  And that deals usually with elements pertaining to human suffering,
[00:11:21.972 --> 00:11:22.933]  Or to well-being?
[00:11:23.613 --> 00:11:24.213]  Or to health?
[00:11:24.854 --> 00:11:38.102]  For example, the food organization, the health organization, the relief agencies, or arbitration of conflicts of... And basically earlier he talked about the G20's the best mode they've got for the world government.
[00:11:38.522 --> 00:11:40.263]  And imagine how outrageous this is.
[00:11:40.584 --> 00:11:45.467]  Private central banks that have engineered the financial collapse on record, that's now public knowledge,
[00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:57.964]  Are saying we're going to form a world government that issues a magic digital currency that you've got to buy from us with interest backed up by real assets.
[00:12:00.125 --> 00:12:03.788]  I mean, why not just go pick some wino off the street corner and make them God?
[00:12:05.409 --> 00:12:10.291]  And, you know, put their face on some money and then we have to pay them interest to have it.
[00:12:13.734 --> 00:12:14.354]  Think about that.
[00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:29.562]  And that's why if we point out that they're illegitimate, autocratic, authoritarian, and that it's immoral what they're doing, then there's no way they can put this into place.
[00:12:30.242 --> 00:12:32.442]  And that's why they're so scared.
[00:12:32.722 --> 00:12:39.344]  And that's why they're going, okay, there is a world government, you know, we're trying to set it up for your own good, it's God's work, it's a moral imperative.
[00:12:39.724 --> 00:12:40.925]  A moral imperative.
[00:12:41.165 --> 00:12:44.966]  This is a guy who brags about how he funded in the
[00:12:47.358 --> 00:12:53.760]  Later administration of Jimmy Carter, the operations with Pol Pot that killed 30% of the population conservatively.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.080]  These guys are in to what they do.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:00.601]  These are eugenicists at every level who want you dead.
[00:13:00.962 --> 00:13:03.502]  They don't just want your property, they want you and your kids off of it.
[00:13:04.763 --> 00:13:06.183]  Skulls out there on the back 40.
[00:13:08.023 --> 00:13:10.124]  And that's the next level of awakening.
[00:13:10.424 --> 00:13:13.245]  The public is now awoken to the fact there is a world government run by banks.
[00:13:14.215 --> 00:13:28.021]  The public had better wake up fast to the fact that this world government is murderous and that they compete with each other in the power structure, in the pyramidal system for who is the most cunning, the most ruthless.
[00:13:28.381 --> 00:13:31.482]  They believe in social Darwinism, survival of the fittest.
[00:13:31.502 --> 00:13:42.607]  They believe whatever they do to murder and kill and steal and poison is a moral reflection of their sickening humanism, their form of humanism.
[00:13:44.264 --> 00:13:45.564]  Now here's a David Rockefeller quote.
[00:13:46.025 --> 00:13:54.747]  The super national sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto determination practice in past centuries.
[00:13:55.688 --> 00:13:59.729]  Here's another one from his book, Memoirs, published five years ago.
[00:14:00.429 --> 00:14:08.212]  For more than a century, ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents to attack the Rockefeller family,
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:14.502]  For the inordinate influence, they claim, we wailed over American political and economic institutions.
[00:14:15.142 --> 00:14:28.867]  Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal, what we know you are, working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as internationalist and conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political economic structure.
[00:14:29.107 --> 00:14:29.907]  One world, if you will.
[00:14:30.407 --> 00:14:35.849]  If that is the charge, I stand guilty and proud of it.
[00:14:37.992 --> 00:14:40.374]  So, that's what's going on here.
[00:14:40.994 --> 00:14:42.215]  And we actually own that book.
[00:14:42.315 --> 00:14:43.996]  It's here in the office.
[00:14:45.577 --> 00:14:49.699]  I want to go back to your calls here, but I want to go back to what's happening nationwide.
[00:14:52.501 --> 00:14:58.245]  The media is really starting to flounder and panic and they're saying, oh my gosh, the fact that
[00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:06.331]  All these anti-incumbent, anti-establishment candidates are winning, whether they're Democrats or Republicans, in both Republican and Democratic primaries.
[00:15:06.812 --> 00:15:11.176]  Whoever is an incumbent or seen as an establishment candidate is losing.
[00:15:12.377 --> 00:15:22.906]  Senator Robert F. Bennett, a few weeks ago in Utah, way more money in media time, and the media got behind him, he still lost to an anti-globalist, a Tea Partier.
[00:15:24.477 --> 00:15:25.017]  Same thing.
[00:15:25.037 --> 00:15:29.881]  33 points above Grayson in Kentucky.
[00:15:30.621 --> 00:15:31.342]  Rand Paul.
[00:15:32.382 --> 00:15:36.105]  The polls showed he was going to win between 22 points and 15 points.
[00:15:36.585 --> 00:15:37.286]  The average was about 18.
[00:15:38.106 --> 00:15:39.647]  Well, you see, it was even bigger than that.
[00:15:40.788 --> 00:15:41.068]  Okay?
[00:15:41.128 --> 00:15:46.271]  And the polls now show he is going to murder, politically, the Democrat.
[00:15:46.752 --> 00:15:49.734]  And so if he doesn't win, we know it's rigged in Kentucky.
[00:15:51.181 --> 00:15:52.602]  Arlen Specter, gone!
[00:15:53.083 --> 00:15:53.503]  Gone!
[00:15:53.744 --> 00:15:54.905]  In the Democratic primary.
[00:15:55.225 --> 00:16:01.851]  And I would imagine the Democrat will be seen, associated with Obama, in Pennsylvania and will probably lose against the Republican.
[00:16:02.752 --> 00:16:04.934]  Same thing happening in all the other races.
[00:16:05.115 --> 00:16:08.358]  In every race, these people are in trouble.
[00:16:08.598 --> 00:16:11.381]  And what did Rand Paul get up and say in his victory speech for the primary?
[00:16:12.483 --> 00:16:13.283]  And that was the big hurdle.
[00:16:13.924 --> 00:16:15.485]  He said this is a measure for Washington.
[00:16:15.525 --> 00:16:20.948]  We're taking our government back and we're not going to have your carbon taxes for your world government over in Copenhagen.
[00:16:21.488 --> 00:16:25.531]  Those videos are up on Infowars.com right now.
[00:16:26.331 --> 00:16:32.114]  So this is so important that everyone get this information out to everyone they know.
[00:16:32.635 --> 00:16:38.178]  Rand Paul, again, has really thrown down the gauntlet and the more hardcore
[00:16:40.279 --> 00:16:46.684]  Our rhetoric is, the more truthful it is, the more we just throw the gauntlet down and tell it like it is, the faster we're going to defeat these people.
[00:16:46.724 --> 00:16:53.710]  They are not invincible, they are scared, they have miscalculated, they are illegitimate, and they will be defeated.
[00:16:54.650 --> 00:17:00.495]  In fact, Paul Watson has now just posted an article dealing with this key C-SPAN Zbigniew Brzezinski clip.
[00:17:00.855 --> 00:17:06.099]  It's Brzezinski decries global political awakening during CFR speech.
[00:17:07.631 --> 00:17:13.513]  It is a very important article that Paul Joseph Watson has written at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:21.617]  So I want to ask everyone to go and get this article, Brzezinski decries global political awakening during CFR speech.
[00:17:22.077 --> 00:17:24.098]  I mean, this is an enemy communique.
[00:17:24.858 --> 00:17:30.600]  Because even though they know we're awake, and now they're just trying to go public with it, the arrogance comes out.
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:36.823]  They still don't understand how we're going to use this clip, and the clip of Cheney at the CFR on C-SPAN saying,
[00:17:39.039 --> 00:17:44.783]  You know, I used to head up the Council on Foreign Relations, but I covered that up when I was back home in Wyoming.
[00:17:45.003 --> 00:17:45.763]  Everybody laughed.
[00:17:46.304 --> 00:17:55.709]  Oh, it's so, like when Bill Gates laughs about, we gotta vaccinate everybody to cut population by half, and the whole audience of sickos clap and giggle on their little demonic murdering power trip.
[00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:57.831]  Those monkeys don't know we're watching them.
[00:18:01.587 --> 00:18:02.828]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:18:02.868 --> 00:18:08.230]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:18:08.471 --> 00:18:13.093]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:18:13.473 --> 00:18:13.873]  It's true.
[00:18:13.953 --> 00:18:18.516]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:18:19.056 --> 00:18:23.759]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.201]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:18:26.581 --> 00:18:31.204]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:18:31.384 --> 00:18:32.285]  And here's the best part.
[00:18:32.505 --> 00:18:35.287]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:18:35.587 --> 00:18:38.889]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:42.031]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:18:42.392 --> 00:18:44.293]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:18:44.613 --> 00:18:45.534]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:18:49.176 --> 00:18:50.958]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:18:52.139 --> 00:18:57.924]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:18:58.245 --> 00:19:00.627]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:02.210]  You worry.
[00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:04.311]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:19:04.611 --> 00:19:06.852]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:19:07.152 --> 00:19:08.992]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[00:19:09.253 --> 00:19:10.453]  Your answer may be at hand.
[00:19:10.853 --> 00:19:14.054]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[00:19:14.454 --> 00:19:19.316]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:19:19.696 --> 00:19:23.017]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:19:23.497 --> 00:19:24.838]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:19:25.178 --> 00:19:27.779]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[00:19:28.039 --> 00:19:30.980]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:39.486]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.

[00:20:01.089 --> 00:20:04.250]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:06.451]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:20:06.911 --> 00:20:07.331]  Don't!
[00:20:07.772 --> 00:20:10.813]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.

[00:21:11.875 --> 00:21:13.936]  Let's go ahead and talk to Eric in Kansas.
[00:21:14.056 --> 00:21:14.877]  Eric, you're on the air.
[00:21:14.937 --> 00:21:15.277]  Welcome.
[00:21:16.338 --> 00:21:23.002]  Alex, you are Paul Revere redo, and it's not every day that you get to talk to an American hero, so I really appreciate the time.
[00:21:23.522 --> 00:21:26.584]  I know you don't like people kissing up to you, so I'll get right into it.
[00:21:27.153 --> 00:21:30.696]  I want everybody out there to rejoice and be merry for a moment.
[00:21:31.096 --> 00:21:34.598]  Slap backs and congratulate each other, but it's right back to work.
[00:21:34.859 --> 00:21:35.199]  Okay?
[00:21:35.299 --> 00:21:37.681]  Well yeah, that's what dogs do when they catch a rabbit.
[00:21:37.741 --> 00:21:40.743]  They'll all spin around and celebrate and then go after more rabbits.
[00:21:41.043 --> 00:21:46.647]  We need to beat the drums and, you know, we've had a victory bigger than Trenton and just, ah, the incumbents are falling.
[00:21:49.309 --> 00:21:51.910]  Well, they were practicing for it already, but that's an unrelated thing.
[00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:57.112]  Google terror drills, nuclear drill practice in Los Angeles and Indiana just the last few days.
[00:21:57.172 --> 00:21:57.872]  So, they're gearing up.
[00:22:19.232 --> 00:22:22.154]  But we will win, Alex, and I'm so passionate.
[00:22:22.254 --> 00:22:23.374]  I'm 31 years old.
[00:22:23.794 --> 00:22:34.400]  I have, I'm working on my second and third degree in college and I do not, my voice is quivering right now because I do not want to lose America by the time I'm ready to just jump in it with both feet.
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:40.643]  And for those of you out there who thought the future looked grim, Rand Paul's battle was one that we won.
[00:22:41.023 --> 00:22:47.767]  And, and this war that we have against good Americans on truth and sovereignty, this is going to continue against us.
[00:22:48.286 --> 00:22:50.928]  And everybody out there should be just raging.
[00:22:51.208 --> 00:22:57.132]  The blood needs to rage turbulently through your American veins, pounding within your muscles and flesh.
[00:22:57.352 --> 00:23:03.536]  And I agree, Eric, and people need to realize we're not going to win overnight, we're not going to win in a year, we're not going to win in five years.
[00:23:03.996 --> 00:23:10.620]  It is that total commitment, realizing we're not going to stop, but it's not just the Rand Paul victory in this key primary.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.242]  It's in every primary, whoever the incumbent is,
[00:23:15.243 --> 00:23:35.175]  is losing every time and JD Hayworth is gonna he's not perfect but he's an angel compared to John McCain and he's gone from 20 points behind to being even with him two weeks ago to now in almost every poll being four points ahead of him and by the time they have what what's the date August 23rd
[00:23:36.676 --> 00:23:48.002]  Uh, 24th, uh, by that Republican primary date, I predict, unless there's a major election fraud and Arizona's bad about it, that John stinkin' McCain is goin' down just like Specter!
[00:23:48.022 --> 00:23:49.443]  OOH-RAH!
[00:23:49.904 --> 00:23:50.724]  YEAH!
[00:23:51.144 --> 00:23:52.085]  YEAH!

[00:23:58.328 --> 00:23:59.588]  I want to play a clip of Ben-Hur.
[00:23:59.628 --> 00:24:00.189]  They found it.
[00:24:00.509 --> 00:24:01.849]  This is us, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:24:07.191 --> 00:24:07.651]  Crank it up!
[00:24:25.811 --> 00:24:28.892]  Yeah, they're just cruising right now.

[00:27:30.936 --> 00:27:38.140]  Incumbent and establishment candidates in the Republican and Democratic Party in every case are losing their nominations for their party.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:44.603]  Not just Rand Paul smashing the neocon by 33 points on top of the victory number.
[00:27:45.844 --> 00:27:47.245]  Blowing him out of the water.
[00:27:48.294 --> 00:27:50.875]  Republican Senator Robert Bennett imploding.
[00:27:51.275 --> 00:27:54.116]  McCain, he's not going to win if there's a real election.
[00:27:54.156 --> 00:27:55.117]  He's now behind.
[00:27:56.037 --> 00:27:57.398]  This is exciting.
[00:27:57.518 --> 00:27:58.718]  Specter, gone.
[00:27:59.178 --> 00:28:00.519]  Arlen, Specter, gone.
[00:28:00.599 --> 00:28:01.599]  Hallelujah!
[00:28:02.199 --> 00:28:03.120]  There is a God.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.221]  James in Ohio, you're on the air.
[00:28:06.261 --> 00:28:06.621]  Welcome.
[00:28:11.703 --> 00:28:13.704]  James, we need to get you up to ramming speed here, buddy.
[00:28:14.861 --> 00:28:18.824]  I let him go, because James wasn't even there pulling at the oars.
[00:28:19.365 --> 00:28:20.346]  Ronnie in Texas.
[00:28:21.286 --> 00:28:22.167]  Ronnie, go ahead.
[00:28:23.088 --> 00:28:24.029]  Hallelujah, sir.
[00:28:24.109 --> 00:28:28.172]  I totally agree with you, and ditto the previous callers rejoicing.
[00:28:28.652 --> 00:28:29.633]  There's evidence here.
[00:28:29.653 --> 00:28:36.359]  Now, we will continue to win back the Republic, but the work just starts here over the big party Republican War Party scum.
[00:28:36.419 --> 00:28:43.825]  But, you know, Dr. Rand Paul's victory was a huge victory, but it's not unrelated to the meltdown, the criminal
[00:28:44.372 --> 00:29:10.260]  political meltdown of longtime traitor Arlen Miracle Bullet Specter, who, as you know, not only dreamt up the farcical Miracle Bullet Theory to explain away the hogwash about Oswald, the so-called lone gunman in the JFK assassination, but he also personally hijacked the conviction and elimination of former president, still predator, slick, truly evil Clint Trader, thereby gifting us all with Ms.
[00:29:11.047 --> 00:29:12.868]  Ronny, I appreciate your call.
[00:29:12.888 --> 00:29:16.231]  Let's talk to Chris in Kentucky, where Rand Paul smashed the enemy.
[00:29:16.251 --> 00:29:16.651]  Go ahead, Chris.
[00:29:16.671 --> 00:29:17.252]  Oh, he certainly did.
[00:29:17.272 --> 00:29:20.774]  And this is, it was just a, really a lot of exciting people out here.
[00:29:39.863 --> 00:29:41.984]  You were in the Sunday Courier-Journal, Dave.
[00:29:42.004 --> 00:29:44.324]  There's a little paragraph, an attack ad on you.
[00:29:44.504 --> 00:29:49.085]  No, they're running attack ad TV ads against Rand Paul because he comes on this show.
[00:29:49.685 --> 00:29:53.826]  And then some of the neocons that are trying to infiltrate are like, oh, don't be involved with Alex Jones.
[00:29:54.266 --> 00:29:55.326]  The Pauls aren't stupid.
[00:29:55.587 --> 00:30:01.268]  They know when the system attacks them of being kook conspiracy terrorists, that only makes them more popular.
[00:30:01.488 --> 00:30:04.969]  When the media attacks somebody, the public knows they're good.
[00:30:05.229 --> 00:30:06.369]  It doesn't work anymore.
[00:30:07.156 --> 00:30:08.457]  No, it isn't going to work anymore.
[00:30:08.497 --> 00:30:13.380]  And then when they see your name on here and a lot of people have never heard of you, you're going to get some hits now.
[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:14.761]  They want to know the truth.
[00:30:14.861 --> 00:30:16.082]  We are getting a couple hits.
[00:30:16.282 --> 00:30:17.563]  Yeah, we are getting a few visitors.
[00:30:17.963 --> 00:30:18.864]  That's good.
[00:30:18.984 --> 00:30:22.427]  It was like two million visitors a week.
[00:30:22.487 --> 00:30:23.567]  Now it's a million a day.
[00:30:23.627 --> 00:30:25.028]  So yeah, the sites are growing.
[00:30:25.769 --> 00:30:26.890]  Oh, that's incredible.
[00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:28.631]  And you know, like the Kansas caller said,
[00:30:29.201 --> 00:30:30.022]  We'd still have to keep going.
[00:30:30.042 --> 00:30:30.422]  There's hope.
[00:30:30.442 --> 00:30:31.784]  But there's still a lot of work to do.
[00:30:31.824 --> 00:30:33.125]  We still have to get these films out.
[00:30:33.145 --> 00:30:35.928]  I'm still burning copies of the Obama... Still a lot of work to do!
[00:30:36.169 --> 00:30:37.670]  We're not even winning the war yet.
[00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:38.711]  We've won some battles.
[00:30:38.972 --> 00:30:41.394]  But they won so many battles before we got in the fight.
[00:30:41.715 --> 00:30:44.277]  But what we've learned is, every time we fight, we win.
[00:30:45.258 --> 00:30:46.940]  Resistance is victory.
[00:30:47.221 --> 00:30:52.427]  The spirit of resistance, with liberty, animating it, is invincible.
[00:30:52.707 --> 00:30:53.968]  Now, the globalists are mad, though.
[00:30:54.008 --> 00:30:55.690]  They're going to wreck the economy faster.
[00:30:55.951 --> 00:30:57.312]  They're going to steal everything.
[00:30:57.673 --> 00:31:01.677]  Even if we kick them out, they'd probably set off some nukes as they left.
[00:31:01.737 --> 00:31:03.399]  I mean, they're very upset.
[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:04.861]  So this isn't going to be fun.
[00:31:06.089 --> 00:31:08.651]  You know, it's like when you break your leg and a bone's sticking out the side.
[00:31:08.951 --> 00:31:13.835]  You gotta go in and get surgery, and it feels bad, but at least, you know, you saved your leg.
[00:31:14.516 --> 00:31:28.647]  And so it's not gonna be fun, ladies and gentlemen, but we're going to win, win, win, and our great-grandchildren are gonna remember when we've got moon bases and Mars bases and our first, you know, off-world
[00:31:30.508 --> 00:31:39.331]  Craft, Reach, Andromeda, we're going to remember this time when humanity stood up on its hind legs.
[00:31:39.711 --> 00:31:54.336]  We're going to remember how we defeated the eugenicists who hate their fellow man and when those that love humankind and understand the destiny of this species took back humanity and pointed it towards the stars.
[00:31:54.717 --> 00:31:58.238]  We shall return on the other side of this quick break.
[00:31:58.318 --> 00:31:58.758]  Stay with us.
[00:32:05.094 --> 00:32:06.015]  Tyranny is here.
[00:32:06.355 --> 00:32:10.017]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:32:10.237 --> 00:32:12.499]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:32:12.519 --> 00:32:17.983]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:32:18.403 --> 00:32:24.607]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:32:25.047 --> 00:32:30.590]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:32:31.031 --> 00:32:34.713]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:32:35.213 --> 00:32:39.216]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:32:39.496 --> 00:32:45.019]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:32:45.439 --> 00:32:48.421]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:32:49.001 --> 00:32:50.422]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:32:50.983 --> 00:32:51.403]  It's here.

[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:03.982]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:33:04.382 --> 00:33:09.346]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:33:09.707 --> 00:33:11.428]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:33:11.748 --> 00:33:16.572]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:33:16.752 --> 00:33:17.713]  How much do you want?
[00:33:17.933 --> 00:33:18.694]  When do you want it?
[00:33:19.074 --> 00:33:20.655]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:33:20.955 --> 00:33:21.776]  When will you need it?
[00:33:22.016 --> 00:33:24.038]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:33:24.258 --> 00:33:25.319]  Will there be any food?
[00:33:25.539 --> 00:33:26.880]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:32.143]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:33:32.343 --> 00:33:35.545]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:33:35.925 --> 00:33:39.387]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:33:39.747 --> 00:33:40.627]  How much will you need?
[00:33:40.867 --> 00:33:41.488]  We don't know.
[00:33:41.768 --> 00:33:42.688]  How much do you want?
[00:33:42.868 --> 00:33:43.608]  All you can get.
[00:33:43.808 --> 00:33:44.648]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:33:44.889 --> 00:33:47.669]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[00:34:45.390 --> 00:34:48.251]  Look for Max, the Orange Home Gain Gorilla to help
[00:34:48.351 --> 00:34:53.413]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:34:53.433 --> 00:34:56.575]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:35:10.552 --> 00:35:21.441]  WilliamGame.com, Alipac.us, he heads up American for Legal Immigration PAC, the biggest in the country, and the No Compromise group.
[00:35:21.981 --> 00:35:26.204]  A month ago, here on the show, he outed what is well known in Washington,
[00:35:28.134 --> 00:35:36.539]  They're not even making an issue out of this with the anti-free speech, pro-open border, anti-Second Amendment Supreme Court nominee, Elena Kagan.
[00:35:36.999 --> 00:35:41.561]  But that's how they bribe them, that's how they extort them, that's how they compromise them.
[00:35:41.601 --> 00:35:43.482]  Look what they do in their bedrooms, their issue.
[00:35:44.943 --> 00:35:53.688]  Though I don't want to look at Elena Kagan, it makes me physically nauseous, so does looking at these other people, just because they're such demonic tyrants.
[00:35:54.568 --> 00:35:55.129]  He outed
[00:35:57.063 --> 00:36:24.927]  uh... lindsey graham and then lindsey graham and and and mister gaines also worked in congress uh... suddenly backed off of the borders suddenly backed off carbon taxes suddenly apologized for health care because they were bribing him the whole time they were they were extorting him clearly uh... his bride of the right word to reverse that blackmailing him and i have a big weight lifted off of graham uh... because now they come out and and and adam in the mainstream media uh... it's only a point out that they knew all along
[00:36:25.507 --> 00:36:28.450]  So these people just need to come out of the closet so they can't be blackmailed.
[00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:32.614]  That's why it's wrong to have this going on up there in Washington.
[00:36:32.634 --> 00:36:33.554]  But that's a separate issue.
[00:36:33.574 --> 00:36:40.301]  I wanted to talk to him about the fact that Specter has fallen, Senator Robert F. Bennett of Utah has fallen, J.D.
[00:36:40.321 --> 00:36:44.504]  Hayworth has come from 20 points behind in most polls.
[00:36:45.265 --> 00:36:48.967]  A dead heat with McCain and some polls now passing McCain.
[00:36:49.187 --> 00:36:52.028]  We've got until late August for the Republican primary in Arizona.
[00:36:52.268 --> 00:36:53.229]  That is a key fight.
[00:36:53.509 --> 00:36:58.691]  We have Rand Paul, who is for border security and sovereignty, trouncing the neocon candidate.
[00:36:59.372 --> 00:37:01.593]  So in Kentucky, very, very exciting.
[00:37:01.633 --> 00:37:11.337]  Emmerdam open phones for John, Tim, Steve, Jason and others who are patiently holding today.
[00:37:11.777 --> 00:37:13.138]  And there's new news out.
[00:37:13.698 --> 00:37:36.036]  uh... here mexican pirates attack american fishermen san antonio express news that will put that up on screen here it is out of the san antonio uh... express uh... news pirates again applying the waves of falcon lake mexican president rebukes u s law at white house is arizona immigration laws forcing our people to face discrimination so uh... here's people in america
[00:37:36.476 --> 00:37:59.038]  Can you imagine if we had an American president with 30 million people in Mexico saying, my people, you better do this, telling us what to do in America, and to the point of Hispanic students, that later came out, they were Hispanic, three of the five, can't wear American flags and San Francisco shirts, because it's so upsetting to the people that see themselves as Mexican citizens so much, 200 miles from the border, that they become enraged,
[00:37:59.398 --> 00:38:08.025]  And all over the country, illegals, every time they have big rallies, pulling down American flags at post offices and police stations and at businesses, while the cops sit there sucking their thumbs.
[00:38:08.626 --> 00:38:11.769]  So we're going to discuss all of this today.
[00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:18.234]  By the way, speaking of the San Antonio Express News, give me a document cam shot of this, please, boys.
[00:38:19.155 --> 00:38:23.359]  Texas film incentives mainly are benefiting Austin, Dallas.
[00:38:24.705 --> 00:38:26.707]  And this is from last year.
[00:38:26.907 --> 00:38:30.571]  This is from 11-28-09, or in November of last year.
[00:38:30.591 --> 00:38:37.377]  And it has the head of the Texas Film Commission, this is run by Perry, but the head of the commission itself saying, we are funding Machete.
[00:38:38.308 --> 00:38:45.794]  Now, we called the Film Commission, this race war film, last Thursday before we published our article, it was in the Washington Post, Drudge, and other publications.
[00:38:46.655 --> 00:38:53.381]  We got three million, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, three million additional readers from that one story.
[00:38:53.661 --> 00:38:54.122]  Three million.
[00:38:55.463 --> 00:38:59.907]  Very, very exciting on that, and that's not counting all the thousands of sites that copied our story.
[00:39:01.128 --> 00:39:04.771]  And the headline was, Racist Film Machete Funded in Part with Taxpayer Funds.
[00:39:05.848 --> 00:39:13.613]  The governor's press secretary then called and wrote to us and said, well, it is in the queue to be funded, but we haven't funded it yet.
[00:39:13.953 --> 00:39:18.696]  I then pulled up that the way it works is they agree to funding at the beginning after they've seen the script.
[00:39:19.176 --> 00:39:20.297]  And then there's a final review.
[00:39:20.337 --> 00:39:22.599]  So that's a lie from Rick Perry.
[00:39:23.459 --> 00:39:26.542]  And I tell you, it's too bad there isn't a better candidate against him.
[00:39:26.582 --> 00:39:28.404]  I wish Medina would have won.
[00:39:28.524 --> 00:39:30.886]  But he is a patriot in name only.
[00:39:31.266 --> 00:39:35.370]  But it says in this article, Texas film incentives are mainly benefiting Austin, Dallas.
[00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:36.771]  And I have other articles that say the same thing.
[00:39:37.191 --> 00:39:40.675]  Austin was also the site of the production of the Rodriguez-directed movie Machete.
[00:39:40.695 --> 00:39:44.298]  The project was announced shortly after the film incentives were created.
[00:39:44.618 --> 00:39:47.561]  And Higgins said the announcement was symbolic for the incentive program.
[00:39:48.041 --> 00:39:48.982]  And that's the Higgins...
[00:39:51.035 --> 00:39:52.756]  Huggins, excuse me, is the head of it.
[00:39:53.036 --> 00:39:59.658]  Rodriguez's Austin-based production company, Troublemaker Studios, is also filming the movie Predators, a continuation of the series Predator Films in Austin.
[00:39:59.938 --> 00:40:07.420]  Then we have another one here out of Slackerwood, reporting that Machete is being funded by the Film Commission.
[00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:18.023]  So, caught lying, and we did add the Governor's statement in our article that he sent us, and we need to do another article exposing the fact that there's a cover-up.
[00:40:18.043 --> 00:40:20.644]  You know, Rodriguez has his free speech to make this film.
[00:40:21.735 --> 00:40:23.176]  He has his free speech to make this film.
[00:40:23.816 --> 00:40:27.618]  But you can't then use our tax money for it.
[00:40:27.638 --> 00:40:30.320]  I mean, can the Klan get some tax money for a movie?
[00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:31.261]  I'm totally against that.
[00:40:31.641 --> 00:40:36.103]  Make whatever racist crap you want, Ku Klux Klan, but do not take my money to do it.
[00:40:36.143 --> 00:40:38.165]  Just like I don't want to pay for abortions with my tax money.
[00:40:38.645 --> 00:40:40.726]  Let's go to William Gein of Alipac.
[00:40:40.786 --> 00:40:42.547]  I've thrown out some of the issues we're going to discuss.
[00:40:42.807 --> 00:40:43.728]  Good to have you here with us, sir.
[00:40:44.332 --> 00:40:48.435]  Hey Alex, I want to thank you again for your coverage on that Lindsey Graham situation.
[00:40:48.475 --> 00:41:05.810]  You know, after going through a ring of fire on that, you know, coming on your show, I got such a great, great response from people that understood what had happened there, understood the heat that I took, and understood that, you know, I'm the guy that hit Lindsey Graham and he backed away from Obama and Napolitano, giving everybody a little bit more time right now.
[00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:12.736]  So, I really appreciate that, and I also want to thank you for being so on the mark and on the money about this movie Machete.
[00:41:14.103 --> 00:41:20.525]  I know you get a lot of emails and communications like I do, and I know a lot of people are waking up, a lot of people are taking action, a lot of people are very focused.
[00:41:21.045 --> 00:41:24.826]  But it also seems to me, also, there's almost like a panic out there.
[00:41:24.966 --> 00:41:28.667]  You know, like, there's so many things that are hitting the public at once now and there.
[00:41:28.908 --> 00:41:32.509]  A lot of, you know, confusion and people, almost like some type of state of panic.
[00:41:32.569 --> 00:41:41.011]  And when you look at something like Machete, you know, your job and my job at Alipac has been bringing people information that a lot of times they really, they don't want to hear it.
[00:41:41.451 --> 00:41:42.812]  They don't want to deal with it.
[00:41:44.617 --> 00:41:46.118]  They feel powerless about dealing with it.
[00:41:46.198 --> 00:42:09.609]  And looking at Machete, knowing what you know about illegal immigration and the people behind it, and me looking at the trailer, knowing what I know about the inner workings behind it, I saw it and I told people, I said, look, you know, I see a lot of horrific stuff involving machete massacres, decapitated bodies, gang rapes, mass murder, destruction of nations, and it takes a lot these days to get my blood pressure up.
[00:42:10.189 --> 00:42:11.430]  When I saw that trailer,
[00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:13.430]  And I knew what it meant.
[00:42:13.871 --> 00:42:25.294]  I knew that if that movie is like the trailer was created for the release on May 1st with the message to Arizona, I was like, people are going to die over this film.
[00:42:26.074 --> 00:42:27.775]  People will die because of this film.
[00:42:27.915 --> 00:42:40.179]  And it was everything I could do to fight their urge to send out a national press release, encouraging all Americans to take all reasonable steps to protect themselves and their families.
[00:42:40.452 --> 00:42:41.313]  Well, let me fill you in.
[00:42:41.333 --> 00:42:51.601]  I don't know if you've seen part two we did, but after I was contacted by Hispanic members of his crew, I then received the script, and this is directly from his manager's office.
[00:42:51.621 --> 00:42:55.104]  His manager didn't give it to me, but it's marked, you know, it's his manager's office copy.
[00:42:55.524 --> 00:42:56.425]  It's the official script.
[00:42:56.525 --> 00:42:57.946]  It's worse than the trailer.
[00:42:58.466 --> 00:42:59.567]  It's worse than the trailer.
[00:42:59.587 --> 00:43:00.388]  Have you seen that video?
[00:43:01.671 --> 00:43:03.835]  I've seen the trailer video, but I haven't seen the script.
[00:43:03.875 --> 00:43:07.019]  I saw some mention of it, but I apologize with the rush of information.
[00:43:07.039 --> 00:43:10.004]  I know, I understand you're busy, but let me just fill you in while we're here.
[00:43:10.384 --> 00:43:10.585]  Great.
[00:43:10.865 --> 00:43:11.646]  The video...
[00:43:12.708 --> 00:43:14.849]  That's got about 210,000 views right now.
[00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:17.771]  I show the script highlighted.
[00:43:18.411 --> 00:43:22.254]  It starts with Minutemen killing Hispanics who were then crucified as Christ.
[00:43:22.634 --> 00:43:31.279]  Minutemen then murdering Catholic priests, torturing them to death, burning down Catholic churches, which is meant to invoke, you know, good conservative Hispanics to become angry.
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:35.181]  Uh, Men at Men trying to kill Hispanic children.
[00:43:35.561 --> 00:43:37.301]  All the white people are racist scum.
[00:43:37.782 --> 00:43:39.562]  Attempted assassinations of leaders.
[00:43:39.582 --> 00:43:46.564]  Uh, and then Machete becomes above Christ and Mary and is worshipped at the end as God.
[00:43:46.584 --> 00:43:48.925]  And it turns out he's the hero.
[00:43:49.685 --> 00:43:53.287]  Machete Cortez in the Spy Kids movies, so he's already a kid hero.
[00:43:53.347 --> 00:43:55.288]  That was pointed out to me, and I went and watched the films.
[00:43:55.688 --> 00:43:56.168]  It's true.
[00:43:56.188 --> 00:43:57.348]  So it's a children character.
[00:43:57.509 --> 00:43:59.930]  People were watching ten years ago when the first Spy Kids came out.
[00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:04.952]  Now they're adults, so their childhood hero is now killing the evil racist gringo who deserves to die.
[00:44:04.972 --> 00:44:08.113]  And it's got race war, battles.
[00:44:08.513 --> 00:44:09.674]  I mean, it is incredible.
[00:44:10.424 --> 00:44:13.006]  Well, you know, it's the next step.
[00:44:13.166 --> 00:44:14.507]  It's the next encroachment.
[00:44:14.587 --> 00:44:16.128]  It's the next level.
[00:44:16.589 --> 00:44:19.251]  You know, they're prodding the fat and aging America.
[00:44:19.731 --> 00:44:26.016]  They're prodding the people that are sick and fat and aging and confused and, you know, pacified.
[00:44:26.076 --> 00:44:28.958]  And they're just saying, here we are, and here we are, and here we are.
[00:44:29.078 --> 00:44:35.663]  And after seeing that video, I'm absolutely convinced that that's coming to everybody's door eventually.
[00:44:35.883 --> 00:44:36.364]  It's coming.
[00:44:37.205 --> 00:44:38.966]  To and through the door.
[00:44:39.327 --> 00:44:42.429]  Now me, I'm a peaceful, political guy who's running out of time here.
[00:44:42.449 --> 00:44:44.010]  The good news, you've already mentioned the good news.
[00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:48.694]  The good news is, you know, I've stormed all across the country saying, revolution now, revolution now America.
[00:44:48.994 --> 00:44:49.875]  You've got to stand up.
[00:44:50.175 --> 00:44:51.156]  You've got to get involved.
[00:44:51.636 --> 00:44:55.319]  And it's not just getting out in the streets with the tea parties and just standing in the streets.
[00:44:55.719 --> 00:45:00.963]  You've got, everybody has got to do what the people in Utah are trying to do.
[00:45:01.164 --> 00:45:05.507]  What some of the people in Pennsylvania and Arizona are trying to do all across this country.
[00:45:06.187 --> 00:45:06.828]  Get involved.
[00:45:07.321 --> 00:45:12.147]  With every single federal and state campaign and election you can right now.
[00:45:12.167 --> 00:45:15.851]  I don't care if you've never worked on a campaign before in your life and you don't know what you're doing.
[00:45:15.891 --> 00:45:17.133]  Just pick up the phone and start.
[00:45:17.253 --> 00:45:22.479]  That's all you've got to do is pick up that phone and start because we really do have a chance.
[00:45:23.624 --> 00:45:27.387]  To turn things around here before November, but look at when they're planning on putting that movie out.
[00:45:27.427 --> 00:45:33.131]  Like, anytime there's a new movie like that, it's date can be moved around, but my understanding is they're targeting September right before the elections, correct?
[00:45:33.191 --> 00:45:39.496]  Yeah, no, they're saying it's a political message, and it's September 3rd, and look at how she was the runner-up.
[00:45:39.556 --> 00:45:40.957]  They now admit she would have won.
[00:45:41.378 --> 00:45:48.183]  The judge, a Larry Conquista guy for Miss USA, voted against her because she said, I support states' rights.
[00:45:48.263 --> 00:45:50.565]  That's how militant these groups are.
[00:45:50.865 --> 00:45:56.128]  You're not going to wear an American flag in school, and you're not going to say you're for states' rights, or you're going to pay!
[00:45:56.749 --> 00:46:04.414]  You're going to pay, and the movie Machete sends the message that if we don't get our way politically, you're going to pay all the way.
[00:46:04.974 --> 00:46:06.195]  You're going to pay with your lives.
[00:46:06.495 --> 00:46:08.176]  You're going to pay with your destruction.
[00:46:08.556 --> 00:46:09.217]  You're going to pay
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:22.991]  In a way that Americans have never paid before, because when you picture something like the movie Machete, 12 plus million, and there's also some other books, we even saw a book on this, there's other reinforcing factors.
[00:46:23.051 --> 00:46:33.920]  Communications are being sent, not just with this movie, but other channels through books and radio broadcasts, all priming these illegals in our midst for this possible burning of Rome from within.
[00:46:34.844 --> 00:46:44.511]  Stay there, William, because in the script, it says they rise up with their tools of their trade, with their pickaxes.
[00:46:45.212 --> 00:46:47.073]  That was written two years ago in the script.
[00:46:47.113 --> 00:46:47.794]  Now it's a movie.
[00:46:47.814 --> 00:46:48.534]  They've completed it.
[00:46:48.835 --> 00:46:51.937]  And then you have the woman saying, I'm going to rise up with my pickaxes.
[00:46:52.297 --> 00:46:53.378]  I'm going to kill you.
[00:46:54.058 --> 00:46:56.300]  This is pre-programming going on everywhere.
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:56.961]  Stay there.
[00:47:01.411 --> 00:47:02.672]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:47:02.712 --> 00:47:08.054]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:47:08.295 --> 00:47:12.917]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:47:13.317 --> 00:47:13.717]  It's true.
[00:47:13.797 --> 00:47:18.360]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:23.583]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:47:24.104 --> 00:47:26.025]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:47:26.425 --> 00:47:31.028]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:47:31.228 --> 00:47:32.129]  And here's the best part.
[00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:35.111]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:47:35.411 --> 00:47:38.713]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:47:39.034 --> 00:47:41.875]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:47:42.216 --> 00:47:44.117]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.021]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:47:50.441 --> 00:47:57.746]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:47:58.066 --> 00:48:00.508]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:48:01.148 --> 00:48:01.548]  Good day.
[00:48:01.809 --> 00:48:03.390]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:03.770]  May 19, 2010.
[00:48:03.830 --> 00:48:04.971]  Gold opened this morning at $12.0760.
[00:48:05.011 --> 00:48:08.533]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $12.3991, $6.1996 for a half-ounce, or $3.0998 for the quarter-ounce.
[00:48:08.553 --> 00:48:08.813]  That's $12.3991.
[00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:19.943]  619.96 and 309.98.
[00:48:20.804 --> 00:48:23.448]  Making the right decision is a challenge to investors.
[00:48:23.708 --> 00:48:27.614]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or worse depression?
[00:48:27.955 --> 00:48:32.562]  Many investors are turning to gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[00:48:32.802 --> 00:48:36.283]  Midas has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold.

[00:49:05.638 --> 00:49:06.559]  Tyranny is here.
[00:49:06.899 --> 00:49:10.581]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:49:10.761 --> 00:49:13.043]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:49:13.063 --> 00:49:18.526]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:49:18.926 --> 00:49:25.150]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:49:25.590 --> 00:49:31.155]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:49:31.575 --> 00:49:35.278]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:49:35.758 --> 00:49:39.762]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:49:40.042 --> 00:49:45.566]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:49:45.987 --> 00:49:49.109]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:50.971]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:49:51.511 --> 00:49:51.952]  It's here.

[00:50:04.764 --> 00:50:07.246]  Sinus pressure, sinus headaches that keep you up at night.

[00:51:06.906 --> 00:51:15.595]  We're standing up and what's so evil about the media saying if you're against government health care you're a racist, if you're against anything Obama does you're a racist.
[00:51:15.615 --> 00:51:24.323]  You can see they use it as a weapon and when they invoke racism it actually creates it in the other groups thinking that Whitey is out to get them.
[00:51:24.784 --> 00:51:27.406]  When Mexico has some of the most draconian laws in the country
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:28.560]  I don't
[00:51:49.133 --> 00:52:11.631]  the sidewalks uh... and you know kevin's more what you call liberal and he said to me he said my god it's like a third world country all over the nation everything is folding their shutting state parks national parks everything's going bankrupt and then you've got hundreds of millions of people south of the border saying this is our country get out don't wear american flags shut up
[00:52:13.073 --> 00:52:18.417]  And now Rodriguez is going to make a whole string of films creating this cult icon guy.
[00:52:19.998 --> 00:52:21.359]  It's just horrible.
[00:52:21.399 --> 00:52:22.620]  William Gein of Alipac.
[00:52:23.121 --> 00:52:24.022]  So much is happening.
[00:52:24.062 --> 00:52:27.965]  But again, the good news is the American people are awake.
[00:52:27.985 --> 00:52:29.446]  Hispanic Americans are awake.
[00:52:29.506 --> 00:52:31.948]  And they're saying, look, I choose America.
[00:52:32.088 --> 00:52:33.089]  I choose the Republic.
[00:52:33.389 --> 00:52:35.831]  I'm not going to be intimidated into racial politics.
[00:52:39.154 --> 00:52:40.215]  Your comments on that, William?
[00:52:41.195 --> 00:52:42.739]  Well, I think you're right about waking up.
[00:52:42.779 --> 00:52:45.164]  Look at some of the things that's hit their consciousness recently.
[00:52:45.225 --> 00:52:49.494]  That Ron Gocha speech that we released through Alipac back in early 2008.
[00:52:50.116 --> 00:52:51.279]  Someone grabbed a copy of it.
[00:52:52.248 --> 00:52:54.949]  And thank goodness, Drudge Report linked into the new copy.
[00:52:55.309 --> 00:52:57.209]  And once that happened, it went right up the flagpole.
[00:52:57.229 --> 00:52:58.910]  It was mentioned on Fox and everything.
[00:52:59.550 --> 00:53:01.130]  And had hundreds of thousands of views.
[00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:12.313]  And the whole country's watching this instructor from California stand there and tell his student minions that they're part of the global Hispanic front inside of America.
[00:53:12.753 --> 00:53:13.773]  The Revolutionary Front.
[00:53:14.333 --> 00:53:15.454]  You know, they're soldiers.
[00:53:16.414 --> 00:53:16.554]  And...
[00:53:17.401 --> 00:53:31.531]  So, because he was speaking in English, and because the timing was right, and the right communications tapped in there, America got a little glimpse of the lethal and revolutionary zeal infesting the illegal immigration population.
[00:53:31.631 --> 00:53:38.456]  And we try to point out, those of us that have been steeped in it, illegal immigration is no longer just a political tool.
[00:53:38.636 --> 00:53:39.237]  It's a form
[00:53:39.875 --> 00:53:49.817]  Of warfare against this country, and it's being conducted, made entirely possible by the fact that the American public, we've been compromised at the top.
[00:53:50.597 --> 00:53:55.418]  The top control mechanisms of the corporation groups and government out of D.C.
[00:53:55.478 --> 00:54:03.240]  has been compromised by our enemies, and now they're pumping in enough people that hate our guts to deal with us on the inside of our own country.
[00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:04.580]  That's what's going on here.
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:05.480]  I truly believe that.
[00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:06.721]  I wish that wasn't the case.
[00:54:06.761 --> 00:54:08.401]  I wish it wasn't my job to tell people that.
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:13.026]  Well, no, that's the facts, and that's what globalization is, is playing gribs off against each other.
[00:54:13.046 --> 00:54:22.579]  And look at how the PNAC, uh, you know, information, look at the MIAC report, the Homeland Security report, the ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center reports, they demonize everybody.
[00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:25.921]  Well, I've been telling people, look, don't look for your savior with man.
[00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:55.662]  And don't look for your leaders on television.
[00:54:56.522 --> 00:55:01.345]  You're not going to find your leaders for this mess on television.
[00:55:01.365 --> 00:55:04.946]  And part of the problem we're having here, too, you know, there are racist groups in America.
[00:55:05.086 --> 00:55:13.771]  And sometimes, like I've had some recent dealings with an event we're trying to put on down in Arizona, and it's hard to tell sometimes
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:24.143]  Whether these people who try to paint a big racist target on good people, you know, the Tea Party's 99.5 plus percent of them are all non-extreme people.
[00:55:24.563 --> 00:55:30.085]  But then these people try to get in the middle of it, paint a target on them, and sometimes it looks like they're real racist.
[00:55:30.225 --> 00:55:33.826]  And sometimes it's like, who's really paying these people for this?
[00:55:33.866 --> 00:55:36.787]  Who is really behind this?
[00:55:36.847 --> 00:55:39.908]  Because I am seeing a pattern of
[00:55:40.686 --> 00:55:52.188]  People that either are racist or are pretending to be racist, like skinheads and neo-Nazis and stuff, beelining it for people like Sheriff Joe Arpaio and Russell Pierce and J.D.
[00:55:52.208 --> 00:55:53.168]  Hayworth down in Arizona.
[00:55:53.188 --> 00:56:00.309]  These folks are trying to get in the picture with them, like, you know, jump in front of the car and take a picture as if they posed with them and all this other stuff.
[00:56:00.329 --> 00:56:01.710]  And it's really hard to tell.
[00:56:01.770 --> 00:56:02.590]  Well, let me stop you.
[00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:03.650]  Let me give you some intel.
[00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:06.270]  It broke even on the Drudge Report a month ago.
[00:56:06.310 --> 00:56:08.371]  It was in the Associated Press, AP.
[00:56:09.571 --> 00:56:09.711]  That's
[00:56:27.626 --> 00:56:31.308]  They've been caught doing this, so your instinct was absolutely right.
[00:56:31.748 --> 00:56:32.969]  Well, I wanted to mention a name real quick.
[00:56:33.009 --> 00:56:43.314]  Talk radio guy that we had to keep pulling stuff off our website named Hal Turner, who was constantly putting out stuff about the North American Union, the Euro, and this other stuff, and this stuff turned out being, you know, crud.
[00:56:43.374 --> 00:56:50.138]  It was, like, legitimate looking on the surface, but then we come to find out that after he was arrested, this guy was on the FBI payroll.
[00:56:50.198 --> 00:56:50.718]  Yeah, stay there.
[00:56:51.378 --> 00:56:52.299]  We're on the march.
[00:56:52.319 --> 00:56:54.300]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:56:55.268 --> 00:56:58.089]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:57:00.810 --> 00:57:03.131]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:57:03.211 --> 00:57:05.452]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:57:05.532 --> 00:57:08.273]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:57:08.713 --> 00:57:13.495]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:57:13.835 --> 00:57:18.037]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:57:18.337 --> 00:57:20.658]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:57:20.678 --> 00:57:23.219]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:57:23.239 --> 00:57:26.140]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:57:26.481 --> 00:57:34.084]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:57:34.423 --> 00:57:39.705]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:57:39.805 --> 00:57:42.605]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:57:42.665 --> 00:57:46.086]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:57:46.346 --> 00:57:47.267]  And I got news for you.
[00:57:47.427 --> 00:57:48.727]  You're everyone else.
[00:57:48.767 --> 00:57:49.767]  Invisible Empire.

[00:58:53.218 --> 00:58:54.038]  Thank you!
[00:59:00.612 --> 00:59:05.476]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:59:05.596 --> 00:59:06.356]  What have we got?
[00:59:06.576 --> 00:59:08.698]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:59:09.038 --> 00:59:09.739]  A republic.
[00:59:10.039 --> 00:59:12.621]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:59:12.681 --> 00:59:14.602]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:59:14.943 --> 00:59:16.864]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:59:16.964 --> 00:59:18.245]  So they think they own our land?
[00:59:18.645 --> 00:59:19.786]  They think they own our water?
[00:59:19.966 --> 00:59:20.367]  Children?
[00:59:20.587 --> 00:59:21.367]  Our education?
[00:59:21.708 --> 00:59:22.308]  Our money?
[00:59:22.528 --> 00:59:26.191]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:59:26.531 --> 00:59:30.176]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:59:31.518 --> 00:59:32.339]  We have the facts.
[00:59:32.539 --> 00:59:33.661]  We have the Constitution.
[00:59:33.701 --> 00:59:34.582]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:59:34.602 --> 00:59:35.443]  We have common law.
[00:59:35.503 --> 00:59:37.746]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:38.027 --> 00:59:40.730]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[00:59:40.971 --> 00:59:41.792]  Rise of the Republic.
[00:59:41.892 --> 00:59:46.697]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:59:46.857 --> 00:59:48.218]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:59:48.358 --> 00:59:49.199]  Don't tread on me.

[01:00:13.391 --> 01:00:21.453]  Cyrus Jones from 1810 to 1913 made his great-grandchildren... Folks, I'm somebody who was brought up to be colorblind.
[01:00:21.553 --> 01:00:23.274]  Grew up in Dallas, a very diverse area.
[01:00:24.014 --> 01:00:27.175]  And then in college, Ike was told America was bad.
[01:00:28.155 --> 01:00:30.776]  They had to cancel the Texas Independence Day rally at UT.
[01:00:30.896 --> 01:00:32.156]  Pro-Texas isn't even allowed.
[01:00:32.176 --> 01:00:33.577]  It had nothing to do with the border.
[01:00:34.677 --> 01:00:48.428]  And then I learned about the plan of San Diego, and Mecha, and La Raza, and Azadlan, and I literally saw the mayor of Austin, Gus Garcia at the time, have a proclamation where he said Hispanics are a God race descended from aliens.
[01:00:49.129 --> 01:00:53.072]  I couldn't find that video last week, but Steve Mason's actually bringing it in today, so we should have it tomorrow.
[01:00:54.013 --> 01:00:55.154]  I mean, bizarre stuff!
[01:00:55.774 --> 01:01:03.921]  And we should criticize the Klan when they're trying to radicalize and get white people to be racist, but there's not 30 million Klan members.
[01:01:04.671 --> 01:01:06.936]  And there are 30 million illegals in this country.
[01:01:07.878 --> 01:01:10.282]  And we need to really point out this is dangerous.
[01:01:10.523 --> 01:01:15.733]  And when Fox Studios, 20th Century Fox, is funding a film like Machete...
[01:01:16.823 --> 01:01:21.086]  We've got a big problem here, and so we need to get this out in the open now.
[01:01:21.406 --> 01:01:39.857]  William Gein of Alipac.us is our guest, and I've been ranting and raving, but I wanted him to be able to go over other issues he wanted to cover, things that he thinks is important before we go to calls, and then also I wanted to go over Mexican pirates attack American fishermen, San Antonio Express News, but William, you've got the floor for other key info people need to be made aware of.
[01:01:40.407 --> 01:01:51.422]  Well, one of the things that we've been doing, and we've been doing all along, Alex, is that we've been asking Hispanic and black Americans to unify with white and Asian Americans against this threat from illegal immigration.
[01:01:51.483 --> 01:01:57.291]  And at the same time, while we're telling more radical elements in the white community that appear here and there to stay back and not
[01:01:57.951 --> 01:01:59.712]  Um, target people based on race.
[01:02:00.132 --> 01:02:02.814]  We've got to ask blacks and Hispanics to do the same thing.
[01:02:03.054 --> 01:02:08.356]  They've got the exact same thing going on, except it's being tolerated and it's not being suppressed like it is in the white community.
[01:02:08.396 --> 01:02:18.862]  Now, some of the white hate groups or neo-Nazi groups and whatnot, they believe that moderates and middle, the moderate people in America, you know, we're out of time.
[01:02:18.902 --> 01:02:23.364]  Basically, they know the history on this thing from the Weimar Republic where it ends up
[01:02:24.176 --> 01:02:27.165]  With their people versus the communists in the streets.
[01:02:28.590 --> 01:02:30.291]  They don't mind going there, Alex.
[01:02:30.351 --> 01:02:36.234]  They don't mind going back to that because they know how it often pans out when it's them versus the communists in the streets.
[01:02:36.795 --> 01:02:39.036]  So, we're trying to keep it from going there.
[01:02:39.436 --> 01:02:52.523]  And for it to not go there, people like me and others that are concerned about illegal immigration need to watch our affiliations, do the very best we can to keep people who are being racist out of the political debate.
[01:02:52.884 --> 01:02:55.605]  And we need the help of black and hispanic leaders.
[01:02:55.665 --> 01:02:57.086]  I've said it a hundred times in the
[01:02:57.566 --> 01:02:59.747]  Of course, the smear groups will never give me credit for it.
[01:02:59.767 --> 01:03:08.371]  I've said that my goal is to unify, and this is what I think they fear the most, unify the 80% of Americans that keep showing up in these polls that feel a certain way.
[01:03:08.391 --> 01:03:09.752]  They don't want us to unify.
[01:03:09.772 --> 01:03:10.352]  That's right.
[01:03:10.392 --> 01:03:11.933]  America isn't 80% white.
[01:03:13.413 --> 01:03:14.034]  It's roughly 50%.
[01:03:15.354 --> 01:03:16.935]  So what's that other 30%?
[01:03:17.415 --> 01:03:19.056]  That's Hispanics and blacks and Asians.
[01:03:19.376 --> 01:03:20.477]  They want private property.
[01:03:20.517 --> 01:03:21.617]  They want the Second Amendment.
[01:03:21.877 --> 01:03:23.158]  They don't want to live in the third world.
[01:03:23.945 --> 01:03:29.350]  Well, the way we see it, over 80% of white Americans want the border secured and illegal immigration reversed.
[01:03:29.491 --> 01:03:32.514]  Over 65% of black Americans feel the same way.
[01:03:32.934 --> 01:03:37.919]  And somewhere between 54 and 56% of America's legal Hispanics feel that way.
[01:03:37.959 --> 01:03:42.283]  Now, unfortunately, over half the Hispanics in the country right now are here illegally.
[01:03:42.323 --> 01:03:45.967]  So that reduces the Hispanics that are with Americans down to under 30%.
[01:03:47.368 --> 01:03:50.530]  Yeah, I've seen Gallup polls of 79% of Hispanics want more border security.
[01:03:50.550 --> 01:03:53.892]  So I guess that must be a poll of people that are citizens.
[01:04:08.936 --> 01:04:10.017]  Well, I'm not sure.
[01:04:10.097 --> 01:04:12.499]  We're very guarded about Gallup.
[01:04:12.579 --> 01:04:19.245]  We've seen Gallup come out with some readings that are very far off from the other poll medians on readings like this.
[01:04:19.305 --> 01:04:30.814]  But what I'm trying to say is, the elites that are responsible for what's happening here in the country do not want William Gein, Alex Jones, or anybody else to unify the public against them.
[01:04:31.115 --> 01:04:32.516]  And so that's why
[01:04:33.425 --> 01:04:37.709]  The racial canards are being thrown out left and right to try to keep that from happening.
[01:04:37.749 --> 01:04:38.590]  That is their game.
[01:04:38.610 --> 01:04:39.390]  That's how they play it.
[01:04:39.471 --> 01:04:49.279]  And if there's no racism to be found on a group or individual, they'll either make it up or try to send somebody in to label them like that, which is what we were talking about before the end of the last break.
[01:04:49.339 --> 01:04:56.025]  Even that, you know, one of the biggest racists had a radio station in the country last year when he was finally arrested in court.
[01:04:56.045 --> 01:04:57.707]  It turned out he was on the FBI payroll.
[01:04:58.666 --> 01:05:04.772]  And they had all the emails where he's, the feds are going, good job, bring him out, you know, you'll make him look extreme.
[01:05:04.792 --> 01:05:07.274]  He's like, don't worry, I'm getting, you know, I'm getting him for you.
[01:05:07.674 --> 01:05:13.860]  And it turned out he was the highest level FBI agent, but then that looks like it's classified.
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:16.903]  Then they said asset, but at national security level.
[01:05:17.863 --> 01:05:19.345]  It was above counterterrorism.
[01:05:19.929 --> 01:05:23.210]  He went right after the North American Union and kept floating bogus claims.
[01:05:23.290 --> 01:05:36.135]  I know a lot of people out there listening probably saw in their emails, claiming that he had documentation of the Amaro, the new currency for America, and that a certain number of Amaros and gold had been shipped to China, and he had evidence of it.
[01:05:36.475 --> 01:05:48.119]  You know, over at Alipac.us, the largest archive of information on these topics, you know, we tell people to keep a grain of salt handy, but we do our very best, especially when we see something going viral on the web,
[01:05:48.852 --> 01:05:51.615]  To analyze it and to rate its credibility level.
[01:05:51.635 --> 01:05:54.359]  And we kept looking at this stuff coming out of this Hal Turner guy.
[01:05:54.679 --> 01:05:55.440]  No, exactly.
[01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:57.863]  He would say computers found with a tracker chip.
[01:05:58.584 --> 01:06:01.407]  Instead of covering all the real admissions of tracking.
[01:06:01.827 --> 01:06:02.688]  And then it would be discredited.
[01:06:02.728 --> 01:06:04.631]  Or he said, I got this from the Mint.
[01:06:05.031 --> 01:06:13.015]  When it was a joke coin, we pointed out the men in Colorado that actually made it as an anti-North American Union.
[01:06:13.215 --> 01:06:24.520]  So instead of looking at all the real SPP documents that Judicial Watch got, instead of looking at all the facts that I was covering, you were covering, that Lou Dobbs was covering, instead the media could say, look at this AmeroCoin hoax.
[01:06:25.956 --> 01:06:26.696]  Disinformation.
[01:06:27.137 --> 01:06:38.480]  Hal Turner, who was on the payroll of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, broadcasting racial hatred and racial animosity, was also broadcasting disinformation about illegal immigration in the North American Union and One Currency.
[01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:40.140]  He was putting it out intentionally.
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:42.561]  He had masters and handlers that were paying him to do it.
[01:06:42.981 --> 01:06:48.263]  And so, you know, we know that there's a game afoot here.
[01:06:48.283 --> 01:06:54.685]  I just think that the problem we're having right now, Alex, is getting some of these agents are all around
[01:06:55.565 --> 01:06:57.686]  Well, the best way to deal with it is to call it out when you see it.
[01:07:23.473 --> 01:07:31.757]  But to all, and to follow the people to their car, get their license number, you'll then discover they're a Fed, or they're working for the Southern Poverty Law Center, and that's come out.
[01:07:32.657 --> 01:07:48.505]  But to also just continue to point out the AP article, where these Democratic operatives in all 50 states organized and did go out, and it was also in New Mexico news, they even admitted to the news, they would dress up like Nazis with racist signs, and they even admitted they were doing it.
[01:07:49.725 --> 01:07:55.578]  As long as we explain to the public that most of this is provocateured, I think that's the most important message.
[01:07:56.209 --> 01:08:13.078]  Well, we're going to basically, the Tea Parties have been important and strong up to this point, but we're going to basically steer people away from the rally thing into the campaigns and elections because we don't, for one, we feel that it's the number one place that the public can make the difference that it needs to make.
[01:08:13.118 --> 01:08:22.983]  Yeah, we need to have Tea Parties inside the State House in hearings, inside the County Commissioner's Court, inside the City Council, not just dissipating all of our energy standing around in the street.
[01:08:23.561 --> 01:08:30.806]  Well, each campaign for public office that's active right now is a mini-organization in itself that needs money and people.
[01:08:31.446 --> 01:08:42.553]  And the candidates, I don't think that the Feds and the Democrats and others have a lot of agent provocateurs that are posing as candidates right now, and it's too late for them to create them.
[01:08:43.314 --> 01:08:46.796]  They are able to get activists out there, people at events and events.
[01:08:47.376 --> 01:08:47.717]  I don't know.
[01:09:05.086 --> 01:09:06.166]  Well said, my friend.
[01:09:06.667 --> 01:09:08.367]  Other points you want to get out there to the public.
[01:09:09.447 --> 01:09:23.272]  Let's talk about Mexico being a failed state and collapsing, and the acceleration of crime and murder, especially racial murder, including piracy now in places in Texas bordering Mexico.
[01:09:24.195 --> 01:09:27.597]  Well, you know, I've just recently heard about some of the piracy.
[01:09:28.738 --> 01:09:36.243]  Some of the piracy I would describe as illegal immigration itself as a form of piracy of the American citizenry in many ways.
[01:09:37.304 --> 01:09:41.667]  Mexico, you know, the death count, and the situation there.
[01:09:42.087 --> 01:09:44.769]  I'll tell you a story that I think you'll appreciate, Alex.
[01:09:45.049 --> 01:09:50.793]  A guy that pops on my website every now and then says he's a young man in Mexico who likes video games.
[01:09:51.527 --> 01:09:51.867]  We're good to go.
[01:10:13.701 --> 01:10:23.964]  Where 5 to 15 cars rolled into this little town at 5.30 AM and apparently the government or the federales had some digital cameras set up that documented all this.
[01:10:24.604 --> 01:10:35.947]  And they got out and they blocked the roads and secured the access in a paramilitary fashion with their ski masks and their assault rifles all converged on a villa of some drug lord or something and started firing through the windows or whatever.
[01:10:36.727 --> 01:10:41.248]  And he wanted to know what I thought of the tactics of Los Vegas.
[01:10:42.023 --> 01:10:46.746]  And I said the tactics of Las Vegas are horrible and what you see here in this film is horrific.
[01:10:46.966 --> 01:10:59.715]  However, what you see here in this film could not happen in over half of America because there are more armed men with more firepower than you see in this video within a one mile radius of my house due to a thing called the Second Amendment.
[01:11:00.905 --> 01:11:02.226]  I see where you're going with this.
[01:11:02.246 --> 01:11:03.287]  This is the way they threaten you.
[01:11:03.307 --> 01:11:04.348]  I get the same stuff.
[01:11:04.669 --> 01:11:05.469]  What do you think of this?
[01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:07.812]  What do you think of how we'll kill you?
[01:11:07.832 --> 01:11:10.414]  Oh, are you concerned about that as a form of intimidation?
[01:11:10.454 --> 01:11:11.615]  So that's what it is, a threat?
[01:11:26.337 --> 01:11:43.063]  It is, but it's also, my response is that because I live in the United States, and because I'm a free American with First and Second Amendment rights, that if they came into my neighborhood, or still over half the neighborhoods in America, and tried that, they wouldn't get out scot-free.
[01:11:44.144 --> 01:11:45.844]  Or they wouldn't get away with it more than once.
[01:11:45.985 --> 01:11:54.988]  You know, the citizenry of America is armed, and we are arming ourselves in greater capacities every day, especially after watching trailers for films like Machete.
[01:11:56.381 --> 01:12:01.143]  And therefore, we, the people of the United States, are empowered.
[01:12:01.743 --> 01:12:05.945]  In Mexico, the government has guns, the gangs have guns, the people have none.
[01:12:06.365 --> 01:12:08.126]  And so they are perpetual victims.
[01:12:08.466 --> 01:12:17.350]  What do you think of the Mexican President, we're going to play this clip in a moment, coming out and talking about his people in America, his people and how they're being abused.
[01:12:17.670 --> 01:12:22.052]  This is a foreign power, openly in the U.S., telling us what to do in our country.
[01:12:25.441 --> 01:12:26.281]  What's your take on that?
[01:12:26.842 --> 01:12:34.406]  Well, I think that we should, uh, every time he tries to step in the White House, he should be presented with a bill for his people and our country.
[01:12:34.946 --> 01:12:35.966]  An estimated bill.
[01:12:36.447 --> 01:12:46.091]  And each time he comes back, he should be handed the increased total bill and explained that he's not going to be allowed in the United States or in the White House or any other government institution.
[01:12:46.512 --> 01:12:50.994]  Much less, a couple years ago, Alex, he didn't even bother with stopping by the White House.
[01:12:51.494 --> 01:12:54.656]  Well, just imagine if, say, there were 30 million French in Germany.
[01:13:19.111 --> 01:13:26.753]  And the French President went to Germany and told the German government what to do and told the 30 million French to manipulate the political process in that country.
[01:13:27.073 --> 01:13:28.294]  That is an act of war.
[01:13:28.354 --> 01:13:29.694]  That is an act of subterfuge.
[01:13:29.734 --> 01:13:36.516]  That is an act of military overthrow, of conquest, of infusora, a la infusora.
[01:13:37.196 --> 01:13:38.917]  And no other country would put up with this.
[01:13:38.937 --> 01:13:42.338]  But because the globalists want this, it is allowed in our media
[01:13:43.118 --> 01:13:45.519]  Doesn't point out how outrageous this is.
[01:13:45.719 --> 01:13:49.201]  Let's go ahead and play a clip from the news covering this information.
[01:13:50.241 --> 01:13:59.466]  For his part, the Mexican president said some things that were a bit more restrained than what he said in his own country, which he called the Arizona law, which has not yet to go into effect.
[01:14:00.166 --> 01:14:02.627]  An opening to hate and discrimination in that state.
[01:14:02.987 --> 01:14:06.469]  Here's what he said about Arizona's immigration law on the South Lawn.
[01:14:08.723 --> 01:14:31.384]  We can do so with a community that will promote a dignifying life in an orderly way for both our countries, who are, some of them, still living here in the shadows, with such laws as the Arizona law that is placing our people to face discrimination.
[01:14:33.103 --> 01:14:34.705]  Face discrimination in Arizona.
[01:14:34.745 --> 01:14:47.022]  It's one of the reasons the Mexican government has issued a travel warning to any Mexicans who may travel to Arizona, even though, as I said, the law has yet to be... And now you've got these seditious boycotts by the city of Austin, and I... and listen...
[01:14:48.363 --> 01:14:52.767]  I do tell people, even though I live here, boycott Austin, because they're boycotting.
[01:14:53.307 --> 01:15:00.293]  And you should call the Austin City Council, if you live in Texas or other areas, and say, we're going to boycott you until you stop boycotting Arizona.
[01:15:00.594 --> 01:15:01.715]  And California's doing this.
[01:15:01.735 --> 01:15:07.520]  We're talking about not buying power from Arizona, because the elites want to bust this country open.
[01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:14.105]  But while I have William Gein with us for this segment, the next, maybe five minutes to the next hour, if he can do it, because I'm going to take a few calls.
[01:15:15.266 --> 01:15:22.794]  I'm sure Mr. Gein already knows this because he's so well researched, but what I've discovered living in Austin and in other articles around the country...
[01:15:24.298 --> 01:15:49.405]  uh... city council members brothers in the past and and others the larry conquista leaders in my town have been busted in the past one of them was caught beating within an inch of their life some people they'd smuggled in as a coyote who hadn't paid all their cash others have been caught running whores in others have been caught running drugs in uh... and so really this is just the mexican mafia el jefe's who were here
[01:15:50.265 --> 01:15:51.327]  Just over their people.
[01:15:51.367 --> 01:15:52.569]  They don't want them speaking English.
[01:15:52.589 --> 01:15:54.032]  They don't want them getting the Second Amendment.
[01:15:54.292 --> 01:15:57.518]  They want to keep them as slaves like they do in Mexico.
[01:15:57.859 --> 01:16:02.767]  And a lot of these Laurie Conquista leaders are just mafia criminals who are in political office.
[01:16:04.591 --> 01:16:05.651]  Well, I think you're absolutely right.
[01:16:05.711 --> 01:16:16.693]  One of the things, you know, here we have the president of a failed state trying to tell us how to run our business, but I gotta tell ya, I hope he will keep issuing advisories for Mexicans and Mexicos to stay out of Arizona.
[01:16:16.993 --> 01:16:30.656]  Matter of fact, at this point, till we get this thing settled and our people calm down and their people calm down, I'd like for Mexico, the Mexican government, to issue travel advisories against anybody coming to the United States, like we're issuing travel advisories against anybody going to Mexico.
[01:16:30.736 --> 01:16:32.476]  Right now, anybody that goes to Mexico
[01:16:32.976 --> 01:16:35.197]  For a non-emergency reason.
[01:16:35.758 --> 01:16:38.620]  Is either massively misinformed, uninformed, or an idiot.
[01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:40.441]  And they need to stay out.
[01:16:40.661 --> 01:16:41.561]  Our people need to stay out.
[01:16:41.601 --> 01:16:42.702]  Our dollars need to stay at home.
[01:16:43.182 --> 01:16:44.383]  Mexico needs to stay out of here.
[01:16:44.723 --> 01:16:47.465]  I like the fact they're telling people not to go to Arizona.
[01:16:47.525 --> 01:16:49.246]  That works just fine for me.
[01:16:49.266 --> 01:16:54.669]  And another thing I want to point out, Alex, is that the reason that you see so many cities boycotting
[01:16:56.747 --> 01:16:57.288]  I think so.
[01:17:15.019 --> 01:17:22.627]  You have to be a liberal and you have to have a lot of money to get on the city councils to run a place like Boston and Los Angeles and New York.
[01:17:22.647 --> 01:17:28.133]  So these are the places where they're globalist, no boundaries, no borders.
[01:17:31.736 --> 01:17:44.746]  And Texas is moving.
[01:17:44.866 --> 01:17:47.128]  Texas and other states are moving to do the same thing.
[01:17:47.368 --> 01:17:48.649]  So the globalists are panicking.
[01:17:48.669 --> 01:17:50.230]  They thought they had America dead.
[01:17:50.551 --> 01:17:52.812]  They thought they were going to overrun the country and destroy it.
[01:17:53.073 --> 01:17:55.094]  But the giant is rising.
[01:17:55.515 --> 01:17:57.096]  We'll be right back with William Gein.
[01:17:57.136 --> 01:17:57.636]  Stay with us.
[01:17:57.676 --> 01:17:58.417]  Your call straight ahead.
[01:18:01.033 --> 01:18:01.694]  Fatigue.
[01:18:02.194 --> 01:18:02.674]  Headaches.
[01:18:03.315 --> 01:18:04.316]  Allergies and asthma.
[01:18:04.656 --> 01:18:05.557]  Chronic disease.
[01:18:06.077 --> 01:18:07.478]  Is your home making you sick?
[01:18:07.918 --> 01:18:08.519]  Here's a fact.
[01:18:08.859 --> 01:18:10.660]  Our indoor air quality is getting worse.
[01:18:10.901 --> 01:18:16.525]  And the causes include chemicals, toxic gases, dust, pollen, dander, and even chemtrail particulates.
[01:18:16.825 --> 01:18:23.670]  To rid your home of these contaminants, get the best-priced air purifiers in the industry at airfiltersandpurifiers.com.

[01:18:30.376 --> 01:18:30.836]  And with no
[01:18:30.896 --> 01:18:31.376]  I think so.
[01:19:00.444 --> 01:19:05.288]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:19:05.408 --> 01:19:06.168]  What have we got?
[01:19:06.388 --> 01:19:08.530]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:19:08.850 --> 01:19:09.591]  A republic.
[01:19:09.851 --> 01:19:12.433]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:19:12.493 --> 01:19:14.414]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:19:14.755 --> 01:19:16.676]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:19:16.796 --> 01:19:18.057]  So they think they own our land?
[01:19:18.477 --> 01:19:19.598]  They think they own our water?
[01:19:19.798 --> 01:19:20.179]  Children?
[01:19:20.399 --> 01:19:21.179]  Our education?
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:22.160]  Our money?
[01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:26.003]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:19:26.363 --> 01:19:30.008]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:19:30.048 --> 01:19:31.010]  You have been warned.
[01:19:31.330 --> 01:19:32.171]  We have the facts.
[01:19:32.351 --> 01:19:33.473]  We have the Constitution.
[01:19:33.513 --> 01:19:34.394]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:19:34.434 --> 01:19:35.275]  We have common law.
[01:19:35.315 --> 01:19:37.558]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:20:58.874 --> 01:20:59.654]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:20:59.674 --> 01:21:02.456]  We will not be forgotten.
[01:21:03.336 --> 01:21:05.978]  We won't be left behind.
[01:21:17.654 --> 01:21:22.997]  Incredible pressure is brought to bear on anyone that won't let them erase the borders and set up the NAU.
[01:21:23.037 --> 01:21:28.499]  You know, Lou Dobbs is partially flip-flopped because of his house getting shot up and death threats and things.
[01:21:29.119 --> 01:21:30.860]  That's why this is such a fight, folks.
[01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:34.122]  And not everybody, when they get a chance to leave the Alamo, is going to leave.
[01:21:34.922 --> 01:21:38.504]  But William Gein is not going to leave, and the American people are standing together.
[01:21:38.924 --> 01:21:39.845]  This has to be done.
[01:21:39.885 --> 01:21:41.685]  I'm not trying to win popularity contests.
[01:21:42.026 --> 01:21:44.747]  I'm trying to save this country from the globalists.
[01:21:44.767 --> 01:21:51.150]  I want to go to Tim, Jason, Keith, Pastor John, and a few others, but how do folks get involved with Alipac.us?
[01:21:51.190 --> 01:21:55.232]  How do they get involved in a real group that's no compromise defending America?
[01:21:55.876 --> 01:22:00.719]  I do like the term no compromise because that's where, you know, Lou Dobbs said he was willing to compromise.
[01:22:00.759 --> 01:22:02.360]  We are not going to compromise.
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:04.502]  America is already too compromised.
[01:22:05.002 --> 01:22:14.008]  Our main form of communication with our people across the country, over 30,000 strong, is through our email alerts list at www.alipac.us.
[01:22:19.295 --> 01:22:24.199]  Alright, and you know you talked about that threatening video you were sent.
[01:22:24.219 --> 01:22:25.561]  What do you think of this office getting shot up?
[01:22:43.331 --> 01:22:54.603]  We knew five years ago Los Zetas is the CIA-contracted hitmen, former Mexican military, that they're using to kill off the cartels that aren't laundering their money through U.S.
[01:22:54.643 --> 01:22:54.963]  banks.
[01:22:55.023 --> 01:23:00.029]  And now they admit on Fox News and AP that our own troops are being made to grow the opium.
[01:23:00.469 --> 01:23:04.914]  So if you're getting Los Zetas-veiled threats, that's a threat from the U.S.
[01:23:04.954 --> 01:23:05.795]  government, just so you know.
[01:23:06.311 --> 01:23:17.600]  Well, the thing is, there's only a couple things that I think that keep me safe, Alex, and that is my relationship with God.
[01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:18.941]  That's number one.
[01:23:19.341 --> 01:23:30.649]  And also the fact that so many people are counting on me on this as one of the last hopes in this country that this can all be worked out peacefully and politically.
[01:23:32.228 --> 01:23:34.829]  If something awful happens to me.
[01:23:35.090 --> 01:23:37.851]  This is what we talked about the last time we were on the show and I saw a video.
[01:23:37.871 --> 01:23:39.032]  I don't know how many people saw the video.
[01:23:39.372 --> 01:23:48.877]  At the last time we talked, Alex, I saw a video that you put out because apparently you and I reached a point in our conversations in front of the public like this where we were like, you were like, look, William, you know,
[01:23:50.386 --> 01:23:52.607]  You better make it very clear to everybody you're not suicidal.
[01:23:52.907 --> 01:23:54.468]  I said I am not suicidal.
[01:23:54.568 --> 01:23:55.848]  I am heterosexual.
[01:23:55.888 --> 01:23:56.709]  I love my family.
[01:23:56.749 --> 01:23:58.109]  I don't mess with hookers or heroin.
[01:23:59.310 --> 01:24:06.013]  You know, you put out a video about that because, you know, at this point, just killing us isn't enough.
[01:24:06.093 --> 01:24:14.496]  You know, we have to be found with a needle in our arm and something like that, you know, because they want to discredit us more than anything else.
[01:24:14.536 --> 01:24:16.597]  And if they can't discredit us, you know,
[01:24:17.626 --> 01:24:31.397]  The bottom line to it is that if anything untoward happens to me or my family or my friends or anything like that, you know, I'm one of the last people that, you know, a lot of people are hanging in there for, you know, holding themselves at bay and staying on the peaceful political process.
[01:24:31.417 --> 01:24:42.125]  If things start happening to me or people like me in the country, then what happens next won't be political and it won't be peaceful and I won't be able to control it and neither will you or anybody else.
[01:24:42.225 --> 01:24:44.327]  And it's not going to end like the movie Machete?
[01:24:45.189 --> 01:24:47.472]  No, because these are Americans we're talking about.
[01:24:47.512 --> 01:24:52.679]  We're talking about Americans that have, you know, some of the best people in the world.
[01:24:52.739 --> 01:25:00.730]  Despite all of our problems, despite the loss of morality that has decayed this country so badly, I still believe that we have
[01:25:01.630 --> 01:25:02.350]  Providence.
[01:25:30.201 --> 01:25:33.023]  And it's not all going to be very pleasant, I'm afraid.
[01:25:33.643 --> 01:25:37.845]  We're going to do five more minutes, take a call or two for William Gein, and Big News Blitz coming up.
[01:25:37.885 --> 01:25:39.866]  Stay with us.
[01:25:43.068 --> 01:25:44.609]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:25:45.570 --> 01:25:47.911]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:25:50.506 --> 01:25:51.767]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:25:51.807 --> 01:25:57.149]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:25:57.390 --> 01:26:02.012]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:26:02.412 --> 01:26:02.812]  It's true.
[01:26:02.872 --> 01:26:05.454]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:26:05.694 --> 01:26:07.435]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:26:07.975 --> 01:26:12.678]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:26:13.199 --> 01:26:15.120]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:20.123]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:26:20.323 --> 01:26:21.224]  And here's the best part.
[01:26:21.424 --> 01:26:24.206]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:26:24.506 --> 01:26:27.808]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:26:28.129 --> 01:26:30.970]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:26:31.311 --> 01:26:33.212]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:26:33.532 --> 01:26:34.453]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:26:38.195 --> 01:26:39.136]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:26:39.536 --> 01:26:46.839]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:26:47.159 --> 01:26:49.620]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:26:53.622 --> 01:26:55.522]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:26:56.003 --> 01:26:58.764]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:11.922]  Okay, folks, I've got a bunch of business stuff I've got to take care of.
[01:27:11.942 --> 01:27:12.683]  I'm so busy.
[01:27:12.723 --> 01:27:14.104]  Jason Bermas is going to be sitting in.
[01:27:14.144 --> 01:27:21.811]  News Blitz and Key Info on the Google Police State Info, on government narcotics trafficking in Afghanistan, Mainstream News.
[01:27:21.831 --> 01:27:26.855]  A lot of big new developments coming up with Jason and your phone calls for those that are holding.
[01:27:27.176 --> 01:27:28.597]  William Gein is our guest.
[01:27:29.558 --> 01:27:33.861]  Imagine, foreign group here in the country with government backing saying, we're going to rise up and kill you.
[01:27:35.109 --> 01:27:36.510]  Movies that push this message.
[01:27:36.530 --> 01:27:38.891]  I mean, they really want to set each other's throat.
[01:27:38.991 --> 01:27:39.872]  That is the goal.
[01:27:40.692 --> 01:27:42.533]  And we need to not go along with this.
[01:27:42.573 --> 01:27:44.354]  Tim in Oregon, you're on the air with William Gein.
[01:27:44.374 --> 01:27:44.714]  Go ahead.
[01:27:47.736 --> 01:27:48.696]  Okay.
[01:27:48.716 --> 01:27:49.297]  Go ahead, Kevin.
[01:27:49.957 --> 01:27:56.080]  Hey, I just wanted to point out the media backlash against Ron Paul, or Rand Paul.
[01:27:56.941 --> 01:27:58.422]  I got a bunch of headlines here.
[01:27:58.502 --> 01:28:02.664]  I got one from Newsweek that's the conservative backlash against Rand Paul.
[01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:06.562]  I got the New York Times saying... Yeah, I know, it's a big... I've seen it.
[01:28:06.622 --> 01:28:07.882]  It's a big backlash.
[01:28:08.142 --> 01:28:19.367]  He won by 33 points over his other competitor, and now they're gonna come after him because he's a symbol, but it isn't gonna work because when the media attacks somebody now, the public knows that person's good.
[01:28:19.627 --> 01:28:20.208]  Go ahead, caller.
[01:28:20.988 --> 01:28:21.548]  Exactly.
[01:28:21.788 --> 01:28:31.513]  I'm sorry if I sound a little shaken up here, but while I was waiting on the phone here, I got a call from Oregon Department of Revenue, and they threatened to throw me in prison if I don't pay a past debt.
[01:28:32.922 --> 01:28:36.323]  A little shaken up, but yeah, I'm pretty excited about this whole Rand Paul thing.
[01:28:37.984 --> 01:28:38.724]  Well, they're scared.
[01:28:39.064 --> 01:28:40.225]  They're scared, and I appreciate your call.
[01:28:40.245 --> 01:28:47.107]  We've got to move quick, but yeah, they're really going to come after Rand Paul now, because he's a shoe-in to win that Senator seat.
[01:28:50.109 --> 01:28:51.089]  Your comments on that, William?
[01:28:52.289 --> 01:28:56.091]  I think he's definitely proceeding forward there, and everybody out there has to remember,
[01:28:56.676 --> 01:29:01.665]  People like Rand Paul didn't win, and Bennett didn't lose, and Specs didn't lose.
[01:29:03.723 --> 01:29:04.004]  J.D.
[01:29:04.044 --> 01:29:10.288]  Hayworth didn't get so quickly close to McCain without the sacrifice financially and time of a lot of people.
[01:29:10.348 --> 01:29:14.811]  When we were talking off the air, I wanted everybody to realize they're looking for different organizations to support.
[01:29:14.931 --> 01:29:23.437]  And of course, Alipac.us, we're going to do our very best to rank these races and tell you who needs help and who's on our side on the immigration through our endorsements page.
[01:29:23.897 --> 01:29:33.003]  But you know, we want people to understand each one of these campaigns, not only for federal office, but for state office or county commissioner, they're all mini organizations, miniature
[01:29:33.723 --> 01:29:39.165]  Organizations that need people and funding, volunteers, and people to get involved.
[01:29:39.285 --> 01:29:52.470]  And so if you've never done it before in your life, and if you're looking for the best groups in the country right now to join to fight for secure borders and against illegal immigration, I would say even more importantly than joining Alipac is to join your local congressional and U.S.
[01:29:52.530 --> 01:29:58.873]  Senate or State House and Senate candidate campaigns that you know are with us against amnesty and
[01:30:00.052 --> 01:30:01.012]  Absolutely, folks.
[01:30:01.092 --> 01:30:01.892]  Boots on the ground.
[01:30:02.213 --> 01:30:03.633]  Keith in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:30:03.653 --> 01:30:06.193]  Alex, great to talk to you again.
[01:30:06.213 --> 01:30:07.494]  It's Keith with Funkmaster 5.
[01:30:07.914 --> 01:30:21.177]  I got a chance to talk to Dennis Miller this morning about Rand Paul, and I talked to him about how a lot of people are disappointed with the neocons taking over the Tea Party, and I also was able to plug Invisible Empire a couple times on his show.
[01:30:21.537 --> 01:30:22.837]  Get him to talk to me about it a little bit.
[01:30:23.217 --> 01:30:25.418]  I'll have the video up here in a few days.
[01:30:26.798 --> 01:30:27.118]  Awesome.
[01:30:28.595 --> 01:30:29.936]  What else is on your mind, Keith?
[01:30:31.477 --> 01:30:34.760]  Well, I just think that Rand Paul's thing is going to make ripples.
[01:30:34.820 --> 01:30:42.106]  I think it's really important for people to get on shows, call like I did, talk about it, and just get the word out there.
[01:30:42.987 --> 01:30:43.807]  God bless you, Keith.
[01:30:43.867 --> 01:30:44.468]  Bill in St.
[01:30:44.508 --> 01:30:46.229]  Louis, last caller for William Gein.
[01:30:46.269 --> 01:30:46.650]  Go ahead.
[01:30:47.510 --> 01:30:48.231]  Hello, Alex.
[01:30:48.411 --> 01:30:49.252]  How you doing, bud?
[01:30:49.492 --> 01:30:49.992]  All right, buddy.
[01:30:51.674 --> 01:30:53.495]  Mr. Gein, how you doing?
[01:30:54.716 --> 01:30:56.678]  Great, great, great interview.
[01:30:56.758 --> 01:30:57.318]  Great show.
[01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:00.161]  Answer me this question.
[01:31:00.801 --> 01:31:02.282]  Where's the Minutemen?
[01:31:04.044 --> 01:31:06.445]  Why, what, did they dry up and disappear?
[01:31:06.565 --> 01:31:07.446]  Where's the Minutemen?
[01:31:07.466 --> 01:31:08.546]  Well, you become a Minuteman.
[01:31:08.566 --> 01:31:11.388]  You go down there and watch the border when you see crime and murder and death.
[01:31:11.688 --> 01:31:12.309]  Call the police.
[01:31:12.329 --> 01:31:13.209]  The Minutemen are down there.
[01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:15.671]  They just get demonized and infiltrated and attacked.
[01:31:15.871 --> 01:31:17.252]  We've only got about 30 seconds left.
[01:31:17.973 --> 01:31:19.994]  William Gein, I mean, where's the Minutemen?
[01:31:20.014 --> 01:31:20.814]  You're looking in the mirror.
[01:31:20.975 --> 01:31:21.295]  Go ahead.
[01:31:21.895 --> 01:31:31.761]  Well, most of the Minutemen groups, there's still a couple ones out there, but they haven't had any border operations running for a while, and they've sort of dissipated and had some inner conflicts and other stuff like that.
[01:31:31.781 --> 01:31:33.943]  They're not a real, you know, political presence.
[01:31:33.983 --> 01:31:46.070]  But the other national groups, FAIR, Numbers USA, Americans for Legal Immigration PAC, the larger groups that have been more diversely involved in the fight against illegal immigration, we're all still humming, even though it's a really, really bad economy.
[01:31:46.811 --> 01:31:50.013]  But then also a lot of people who are involved with the Minutemen are now part of the Tea Party.
[01:31:50.233 --> 01:31:51.853]  That's right, William, we're out of time.
[01:31:51.893 --> 01:31:53.214]  Look forward to talking to you again soon.
[01:31:53.694 --> 01:31:54.114]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:31:54.374 --> 01:31:56.315]  Don't forget, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:56.335 --> 01:31:59.355]  This new film, Don't Tread on Me, is now at PrisonPlanet.tv for members.
[01:31:59.755 --> 01:32:00.275]  God bless.
[01:32:01.136 --> 01:32:03.736]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:32:04.136 --> 01:32:09.118]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:32:09.478 --> 01:32:11.198]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:32:11.518 --> 01:32:16.339]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:32:16.519 --> 01:32:17.480]  How much do you want?
[01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:18.440]  When do you want it?
[01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:20.422]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:32:20.702 --> 01:32:21.543]  When will you need it?
[01:32:21.784 --> 01:32:23.846]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:32:23.986 --> 01:32:25.088]  Will there be any food?
[01:32:25.328 --> 01:32:26.670]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:32:26.850 --> 01:32:31.916]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:32:32.136 --> 01:32:35.260]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:39.203]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:32:39.523 --> 01:32:40.504]  How much will you need?
[01:32:40.744 --> 01:32:41.364]  We don't know.
[01:32:41.645 --> 01:32:42.565]  How much do you want?
[01:32:42.765 --> 01:32:43.486]  All you can get.
[01:32:43.686 --> 01:32:44.527]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:32:44.787 --> 01:32:47.529]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:32:47.829 --> 01:32:49.590]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:32:49.610 --> 01:32:50.531]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:33:00.270 --> 01:33:01.531]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:33:01.571 --> 01:33:06.917]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:33:07.158 --> 01:33:11.803]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:33:12.183 --> 01:33:12.584]  It's true.
[01:33:12.664 --> 01:33:17.229]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:33:17.749 --> 01:33:22.452]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:33:22.973 --> 01:33:24.894]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:33:25.274 --> 01:33:29.897]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:33:30.097 --> 01:33:30.998]  And here's the best part.
[01:33:31.198 --> 01:33:33.980]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:37.582]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:33:37.903 --> 01:33:40.725]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:33:41.085 --> 01:33:42.986]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:33:43.306 --> 01:33:44.227]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:33:47.869 --> 01:33:49.651]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:33:50.832 --> 01:33:56.617]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:33:56.937 --> 01:33:59.319]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:34:01.820 --> 01:34:05.461]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:34:05.781 --> 01:34:13.903]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:34:14.643 --> 01:34:18.684]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:34:19.264 --> 01:34:30.086]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:34:30.726 --> 01:34:39.734]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:34:40.235 --> 01:34:45.279]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:52.846]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:34:53.166 --> 01:34:55.929]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:35:02.048 --> 01:35:04.254]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:35:04.836 --> 01:35:07.623]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:10.660]  We are back.
[01:35:10.860 --> 01:35:11.681]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:35:11.741 --> 01:35:15.462]  I am Jason Burmess sitting in for the final hour.
[01:35:16.002 --> 01:35:31.707]  Coming up, I really want to discuss the new developments in Afghanistan and Camp Gecko that interconnect with Hamid Karzai's warlord CIA-funded, openly for the last eight years, brother
[01:35:32.910 --> 01:35:36.212]  And Opium Dealer, because there's a lot more going on there.
[01:35:36.232 --> 01:35:39.555]  It really explains the system of plausible deniability.
[01:35:39.855 --> 01:35:42.497]  It explains how they use pseudonyms.
[01:35:42.557 --> 01:35:44.058]  Colonel John, Colonel Johnny.
[01:35:44.458 --> 01:35:48.861]  It also explains how they use Lockheed Martin of the military-industrial complex.
[01:35:48.881 --> 01:35:49.842]  So we're going to be getting to that.
[01:35:50.162 --> 01:35:53.744]  And another huge, huge story we need to talk about.
[01:35:54.445 --> 01:35:56.746]  I talked about this on my show over the weekend.
[01:35:57.006 --> 01:36:00.669]  Google, over the past several years, they're not telling us how many years.
[01:36:00.729 --> 01:36:01.630]  It means more than a few.
[01:36:02.370 --> 01:36:11.635]  Okay, so more than three years with Google Street Views where they said, hey, we're just going to be taking pictures and mapping out society and it's going to be great for everybody.
[01:36:12.436 --> 01:36:19.320]  Now, if you look at this Times Online headline, Eric Schmidt says Google should not be prosecuted for Wi-Fi records.
[01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:25.103]  It actually shows you a car with a device mounted on the top.
[01:36:25.163 --> 01:36:27.464]  Now, that's not used to take pictures.
[01:36:27.484 --> 01:36:30.106]  See, photographs are taken from cameras.
[01:36:31.024 --> 01:36:37.188]  Now, they said over the last several years, accidentally, they were taking all the wireless information.
[01:36:37.489 --> 01:36:57.463]  And if you're part of the dumbed-down masses, and you read the local headlines that were basically in the back of the paper, and not made out to be a big deal, you might believe that if you didn't read three, four paragraphs in, when you realize, hey, wait a minute, taking pictures has nothing to do with data mining all of the information surrounding them wirelessly.
[01:36:58.163 --> 01:37:04.684]  And now Schmidt is pleading with the international and American community not to prosecute him.
[01:37:05.205 --> 01:37:08.485]  The chief executive of Google admitted to major privacy mistakes.
[01:37:08.745 --> 01:37:09.625]  Mistakes, please.
[01:37:10.106 --> 01:37:18.267]  Today as regulators prepare to launch probes into the company for recording personal communication sent over unsecured wireless networks in people's homes.
[01:37:18.307 --> 01:37:25.649]  Now Eric Schmidt is featured ever so shortly in Invisible Empire and we're going to play that clip briefly coming up, not right now.
[01:37:26.209 --> 01:37:31.072]  But he clearly discusses how he wants to talk about what's going on in the world, where we're going.
[01:37:31.333 --> 01:37:35.315]  The New World Order, as they call it, referring to the elitist he works with.
[01:37:35.455 --> 01:37:39.819]  He is a very intricate part of the military-industrial complex at this point.
[01:37:40.139 --> 01:37:44.021]  Eric Schmidt said that the company had not authorized the activity of its streetcar views.
[01:37:44.202 --> 01:37:45.883]  Give me a break, didn't authorize it.
[01:37:46.323 --> 01:37:52.530]  Which have been collecting snippets of people's online activities broadcast over unprotected home and business Wi-Fi networks.
[01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:58.877]  Which, depending on the year, were about 70-80% of the wireless networks out there.
[01:37:59.057 --> 01:37:59.698]  And this is what he said.
[01:37:59.998 --> 01:38:01.840]  No harm, no foul.
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:04.983]  Hey Eric, it's not a basketball game, brother.
[01:38:05.104 --> 01:38:06.125]  It's real life.
[01:38:07.668 --> 01:38:19.877]  Speaking at Google's Zeitgeist conference at the Grove Hilton in Hartfordshire, Mr. Schmidt said that the greater damage had been done to the company's reputation rather than to the individuals themselves.
[01:38:20.237 --> 01:38:25.821]  And then he said, oh, it was just a relatively small amount of data that was collected and it was not authorized.
[01:38:26.122 --> 01:38:28.583]  We stopped driving immediately.
[01:38:29.064 --> 01:38:30.525]  Total lie!
[01:38:31.005 --> 01:38:32.586]  This just came out this week.
[01:38:32.926 --> 01:38:36.488]  Most of the country has been mapped with Google Street Views.
[01:38:36.768 --> 01:38:38.169]  They didn't stop anything.
[01:38:38.509 --> 01:38:40.590]  There appears to be no use of data.
[01:38:40.870 --> 01:38:42.131]  It's sitting on a hard drive.
[01:38:42.451 --> 01:38:48.535]  And then he goes on to say, we will not delete the collected data until ordered to do so.
[01:38:49.275 --> 01:38:54.618]  And again, because it's a military industrial complex company, they work with the NSA.
[01:38:54.658 --> 01:38:58.220]  They're part of a NASA program out there, folks.
[01:38:59.875 --> 01:39:10.578]  The UK Information Commissioner's Office has said that the Data Protection Act appeared to have been breached, but that after receiving assurances from Google that it would delete the data as soon as reasonably possible.
[01:39:10.938 --> 01:39:14.218]  So again, they were aware that they were collecting data.
[01:39:14.399 --> 01:39:20.320]  The UK Information Commissioner's Office knew that this wasn't just about street views, it was about maintaining
[01:39:20.860 --> 01:39:33.945]  All of this wireless data, whether that be your emails, your bank accounts, your passwords, the websites you visited, all tracked, traced, and databased on another level with a private company called Google.
[01:39:34.225 --> 01:39:35.145]  That's the reality.
[01:39:35.465 --> 01:39:42.248]  And the UK Information Commissioner's office was aware of it, but they were assured, oh, they're going to delete the data as soon as they collect it.
[01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:45.881]  They talk to you like you're five-year-old children.
[01:39:46.261 --> 01:39:53.403]  The company admitted last week that the car's radio antenna obtained emails and other bits of information when the vehicles passed through towns and cities.
[01:39:53.643 --> 01:40:01.925]  Google said the data was mistakenly collected and only in short bursts as the vehicles passed by and was never used.
[01:40:02.665 --> 01:40:06.447]  We're continually struggling with the questions, said Schmidt.
[01:40:06.747 --> 01:40:10.669]  We have to decide what is and what isn't appropriate in the privacy sphere.
[01:40:11.029 --> 01:40:14.011]  Each government and company will decide differently.
[01:40:14.831 --> 01:40:15.312]  I don't agree.
[01:40:15.332 --> 01:40:16.973]  They're not deciding differently.
[01:40:16.993 --> 01:40:20.094]  They're beta testing separate programs across the world.
[01:40:20.214 --> 01:40:27.118]  In my film, Invisible Empire, I chronicle how the UK, for the last year plus, has been putting CCTV cameras
[01:40:27.638 --> 01:40:29.599]  in Sinbin family homes.
[01:40:29.780 --> 01:40:36.704]  In other words, their CPS decides what families are bad and now they're surveilled in their homes with CCTV cameras.
[01:40:36.924 --> 01:40:38.445]  This is just another step.
[01:40:38.485 --> 01:40:40.226]  We also expose an invisible empire.
[01:40:40.766 --> 01:40:49.552]  AT&T and all the other large telecommunication companies out there, which Google is becoming a part of, folks, with their Android phone, with their Chrome software.
[01:40:49.632 --> 01:40:52.134]  Chrome is another internet browser.
[01:40:52.194 --> 01:40:54.075]  It revealed that, oh, they are also
[01:40:54.355 --> 01:40:59.957]  Taking all of the information and dumping it into a secret room on a private server.
[01:41:00.197 --> 01:41:05.118]  Everything you've done on the internet for the past 10 years.
[01:41:05.458 --> 01:41:06.959]  Get with reality.
[01:41:07.019 --> 01:41:08.759]  Alright, I want to play this clip briefly.
[01:41:08.799 --> 01:41:09.739]  Do we not have it yet?
[01:41:09.759 --> 01:41:11.320]  Alright so we'll play it in the next segment.
[01:41:12.180 --> 01:41:13.081]  We're good to go.
[01:41:25.512 --> 01:41:30.294]  And attend to this situation as front page news.
[01:41:30.854 --> 01:41:33.255]  90% of you out there have Google as your homepage.
[01:41:33.716 --> 01:41:35.697]  We use it on a daily basis.
[01:41:35.937 --> 01:41:39.738]  The word is now synonymous with the web.
[01:41:40.139 --> 01:41:45.181]  It is ingrained in not only pop culture, but culture in general.
[01:41:45.941 --> 01:41:51.564]  And I want to move on to another text story because Pakistan is now blocking Facebook.
[01:41:52.424 --> 01:42:15.120]  If you don't understand why we get on the air, we talk about the Cyber Security Act, the Cyber Bullying Act, Obama's plans, and he openly talked about this months and months and months ago to set up a cyber security office with a cyber security czar, CNN playing these wacko scenarios where Michael Chertoff and others are talking about regulating the internet as though it's real.
[01:42:16.471 --> 01:42:17.871]  Oh my God, a crisis has happened?
[01:42:18.011 --> 01:42:18.452]  And you know what?
[01:42:18.472 --> 01:42:20.892]  If the people don't like it, that's too damn bad.
[01:42:20.952 --> 01:42:21.413]  And you know what?
[01:42:22.213 --> 01:42:26.574]  If the governors don't like the National Guard being on the streets with U.S.
[01:42:26.614 --> 01:42:28.555]  military, that's too damn bad too.
[01:42:28.635 --> 01:42:29.495]  Watch it for yourself.
[01:42:29.535 --> 01:42:32.236]  So Muslim anger prompts Pakistan to block Facebook.
[01:42:32.476 --> 01:42:36.297]  And this is how the media plays us off against one another.
[01:42:36.597 --> 01:42:36.838]  We're good.
[01:42:52.398 --> 01:42:56.080]  Almost a decade later, really almost nine years later, after 9-11.
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:58.541]  Without 9-11, people don't understand.
[01:42:58.601 --> 01:43:11.188]  No one really cared about these cartoons or depictions of Mohammed because the media didn't play them up to incite violence and misunderstanding and miscommunication among Americans and the Middle East.
[01:43:12.148 --> 01:43:29.100]  The Facebook page at the center of the dispute, Everybody Draw Muhammad Day, encourages users to post the images of the Prophet on May 20th to protest threads made by a radical Muslim group against the creators of South Park for depicting Muhammad in a bear suit during an episode earlier this year.
[01:43:29.140 --> 01:43:32.362]  Now if you're unaware of this whole South Park situation, before 9-11,
[01:43:33.303 --> 01:43:35.985]  South Park did an episode called The Super Best Friends.
[01:43:36.345 --> 01:43:40.948]  It was kind of a rip-off of Wonder Woman and Superman, but instead it was all these different religious figures.
[01:43:41.068 --> 01:43:44.610]  And then they didn't know it wasn't proper to show an image of Muhammad.
[01:43:44.630 --> 01:43:45.891]  So, the network didn't know.
[01:43:46.071 --> 01:43:47.272]  The South Park guys didn't know.
[01:43:47.512 --> 01:43:48.453]  They showed Muhammad.
[01:43:49.033 --> 01:43:50.814]  No one made a big deal about it.
[01:43:50.834 --> 01:43:52.775]  He was on screen for 22 plus minutes.
[01:43:52.815 --> 01:43:53.736]  No one said a word.
[01:43:54.056 --> 01:43:54.396]  Nobody.
[01:43:54.816 --> 01:43:55.237]  Not a word.
[01:43:56.789 --> 01:44:14.802]  So then, ten plus years later, after 9-11, they want to use the same character, and now they have a huge censored box, you can't hear him, you can't see him, they're just showing you the absurdity about not being able to satirize a very public figure in Muhammad, a very public religious figure.
[01:44:15.302 --> 01:44:23.044]  And now it's all over the place and it's used for division, and it has prompted Pakistan to block Facebook.
[01:44:23.064 --> 01:44:28.825]  Can you imagine living in a country, much like China, where they just block YouTube, they block Facebook?
[01:44:29.025 --> 01:44:31.926]  You no longer have a way to get open source information.
[01:44:32.206 --> 01:44:37.107]  That's why the internet is so important in this info war.
[01:44:37.127 --> 01:44:44.669]  Without it, we couldn't put films like Don't Tread on Me, the latest film from Gary Franchi and William Lewis, over at PrisonPlanet.tv for subscribers.
[01:44:44.929 --> 01:44:52.553]  We wouldn't be able to put Invisible Empire up on YouTube for free with over 360,000 views on just one link.
[01:44:52.573 --> 01:44:55.114]  There's another full link out there with 50,000 views.
[01:44:55.555 --> 01:44:59.597]  The thing has been seen by over half a million people easily.
[01:45:00.337 --> 01:45:00.898]  Easily!
[01:45:01.358 --> 01:45:02.219]  In the last month.
[01:45:02.299 --> 01:45:03.360]  That's how we have victories.
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:13.849]  People become aware of the issues and then involved and then they go to the voting booths and they vote Rand Paul and they vote Arlen Warren Commission Specter out of office after all these years.
[01:45:14.190 --> 01:45:16.932]  This is a guy that's been around forever.
[01:45:17.012 --> 01:45:19.975]  Specter is about as limited hangout as you can get.
[01:45:20.015 --> 01:45:25.320]  If you are unaware of this individual, he also headed up the Able Danger hearings, which really
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:42.337]  We're supposed to shine light on this black ops program headed by Tony Schaefer, who's done this show now several times, and his unit with Eric Clinesmith and others, that they had found Ada and three of the other cells prior to 9-11 and tried to go to the FBI 70 plus times.
[01:45:42.377 --> 01:45:45.320]  And you know what Arlen Block the Truth Specter does?
[01:45:45.660 --> 01:45:51.662]  He sits up there and panders to the situation and talks about, oh, it must be because of posse commentatus.
[01:45:51.922 --> 01:45:53.623]  Posse commentatus is a bad thing.
[01:45:54.083 --> 01:45:56.304]  No, posse commentatus is a good thing.
[01:45:56.504 --> 01:45:59.225]  It's a separation of the military and police.
[01:45:59.285 --> 01:46:00.645]  We have it for a reason.
[01:46:00.665 --> 01:46:04.006]  And posse commentatus had nothing to do with able danger.
[01:46:04.026 --> 01:46:11.429]  And they were very willing to break that premise at the G20 in Pittsburgh when they put troops on the street.
[01:46:11.449 --> 01:46:13.470]  So goodbye, Arlen Specter.
[01:46:14.210 --> 01:46:15.711]  And hello, Liberty!
[01:46:16.511 --> 01:46:18.913]  Let's get Rand Paul into the Senate.
[01:46:19.173 --> 01:46:20.654]  Let's take this to the next level.
[01:46:20.854 --> 01:46:24.256]  Let's scream from the mountaintops that we can have victories.
[01:46:24.336 --> 01:46:27.578]  Let people know that Google isn't the savior.
[01:46:27.818 --> 01:46:30.239]  It doesn't have your best interests at heart.
[01:46:30.539 --> 01:46:35.362]  On the other side, I really want to get into this situation in Afghanistan, because some of the headlines are out there.
[01:46:35.602 --> 01:46:37.483]  Oh no, the Taliban's attacking U.S.
[01:46:37.544 --> 01:46:37.884]  bases!
[01:46:38.524 --> 01:46:38.864]  Wait a minute!
[01:46:38.884 --> 01:46:39.986]  We hire Taliban!
[01:46:40.026 --> 01:46:41.167]  We created Al-Qaeda!
[01:46:41.607 --> 01:46:43.629]  We run the militant groups!
[01:46:43.930 --> 01:46:45.451]  That and much, much more coming up.
[01:46:45.491 --> 01:46:46.412]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:46:46.472 --> 01:46:50.056]  I'm Jason Bermas, sitting in PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[01:47:00.911 --> 01:47:07.133]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:47:07.593 --> 01:47:15.355]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:47:15.695 --> 01:47:23.537]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:47:23.877 --> 01:47:28.618]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:47:28.958 --> 01:47:33.679]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:47:34.180 --> 01:47:38.041]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:47:38.521 --> 01:47:39.541]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:47:39.621 --> 01:47:43.642]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:47:44.102 --> 01:47:48.509]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:47:49.030 --> 01:47:51.593]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:47:52.014 --> 01:47:53.677]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:47:53.797 --> 01:47:54.017]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:48:00.186 --> 01:48:01.307]  Are you prepared?
[01:48:01.567 --> 01:48:03.649]  Well, you need to be hardcore prepared.
[01:48:03.869 --> 01:48:04.930]  There is a difference.
[01:48:05.250 --> 01:48:10.855]  To be hardcore prepared, equip yourself with the latest survival gear available at tacktowngear.com.
[01:48:11.136 --> 01:48:14.098]  All Tactown gear has been field tested by Canadian and U.S.
[01:48:14.138 --> 01:48:15.800]  forces, so you know it's tough.
[01:48:15.940 --> 01:48:16.901]  What kind of gear?
[01:48:16.921 --> 01:48:19.763]  72-hour survival kits as low as $55, holsters for $21, and
[01:48:22.145 --> 01:48:22.505]  I think so.
[01:48:41.852 --> 01:48:45.235]  Visit tacktowngear.com right now for your preparedness needs.
[01:48:45.475 --> 01:48:48.218]  That's T-A-C-T-O-W-N-G-E-A-R-D-O-T-C-O-M.
[01:48:48.518 --> 01:48:50.100]  Tactowngear.com.
[01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:51.861]  Or call Tactown Gear at 418-844-9111.
[01:48:51.982 --> 01:48:52.642]  Again, that's 418-844-9111.
[01:49:00.134 --> 01:49:04.998]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:49:05.098 --> 01:49:05.878]  What have we got?
[01:49:06.098 --> 01:49:08.220]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:49:08.540 --> 01:49:09.281]  A republic.
[01:49:09.561 --> 01:49:12.123]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:49:12.203 --> 01:49:14.104]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:49:14.465 --> 01:49:16.366]  Two wolves in a sheet voting on what's for dinner.
[01:49:16.486 --> 01:49:17.767]  So they think they own our land?
[01:49:18.167 --> 01:49:19.288]  They think they own our water?
[01:49:19.488 --> 01:49:19.889]  Children?
[01:49:20.089 --> 01:49:20.889]  Our education?
[01:49:21.210 --> 01:49:21.850]  Our money?
[01:49:22.050 --> 01:49:25.693]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:49:26.053 --> 01:49:29.694]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:49:29.734 --> 01:49:30.734]  You have been warned!
[01:49:31.034 --> 01:49:31.855]  We have the facts.
[01:49:32.055 --> 01:49:33.175]  We have the Constitution.
[01:49:33.215 --> 01:49:34.095]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:49:34.115 --> 01:49:34.955]  We have common law.
[01:49:34.996 --> 01:49:37.256]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:37.536 --> 01:49:40.237]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[01:49:40.477 --> 01:49:41.337]  Rise of the Republic.
[01:49:41.417 --> 01:49:46.199]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:49:46.379 --> 01:49:47.699]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:49:47.879 --> 01:49:48.699]  Don't Tread on Me.
[01:49:48.959 --> 01:49:50.180]  Order it at InfoWars.com.
[01:49:51.620 --> 01:50:03.365]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:50:03.765 --> 01:50:08.727]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:50:09.107 --> 01:50:10.828]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:50:11.148 --> 01:50:15.970]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:50:16.150 --> 01:50:17.111]  How much do you want?
[01:50:17.331 --> 01:50:18.071]  When do you want it?
[01:50:18.451 --> 01:50:20.052]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:50:20.332 --> 01:50:21.152]  When will you need it?
[01:50:21.392 --> 01:50:23.473]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:50:23.613 --> 01:50:24.713]  Will there be any food?
[01:50:24.933 --> 01:50:26.274]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:50:26.474 --> 01:50:31.536]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:50:31.736 --> 01:50:34.857]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:50:35.317 --> 01:50:38.819]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:50:39.139 --> 01:50:40.120]  How much will you need?
[01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:41.000]  We don't know.
[01:50:41.260 --> 01:50:42.181]  How much do you want?
[01:50:42.381 --> 01:50:43.101]  All you can get.
[01:50:43.301 --> 01:50:44.142]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:50:44.402 --> 01:50:47.164]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:50:47.444 --> 01:50:49.625]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:50:49.645 --> 01:50:50.645]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:51:10.313 --> 01:51:12.015]  We are back live, folks.
[01:51:12.055 --> 01:51:13.157]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:51:13.197 --> 01:51:17.082]  I am Jason Burma, sitting in for the final hour of the Alex Jones program.
[01:51:17.102 --> 01:51:25.132]  We're going to be taking calls in the next segment and wrapping up what I had to say about Eric Schmidt, the CEO of Google, denying
[01:51:25.632 --> 01:51:35.718]  That Google was actively taking this data and information and telling prosecutors not to investigate is absolutely obscene and absolutely absurd.
[01:51:35.758 --> 01:51:43.302]  They were out there to take photographs and they were data mining the entire country and putting this information on a hard drive.
[01:51:43.322 --> 01:51:44.203]  They say they didn't use it.
[01:51:44.263 --> 01:51:45.804]  Oh no, they never used it!
[01:51:46.721 --> 01:51:52.487]  But we're going to play this clip, and this is from the finale, the credits of Invisible Empire, A New World Order to Find.
[01:51:52.507 --> 01:51:58.613]  So you might hear another couple New World Order quotes, including one from James Woolsey, the ex-director of the CIA.
[01:51:58.993 --> 01:52:01.856]  But we're also going to show you Eric Schmidt talking about what?
[01:52:02.176 --> 01:52:05.600]  The New World Order, the system in which he is a part of.
[01:52:05.640 --> 01:52:06.481]  So let's hit that clip.
[01:52:06.869 --> 01:52:07.930]  A lot about that today.
[01:52:07.950 --> 01:52:09.111]  Let's take the New World Order.
[01:52:09.251 --> 01:52:10.693]  It's an interesting phrase.
[01:52:10.913 --> 01:52:12.935]  I've been thinking a little bit about the structure of the world, right?
[01:52:12.975 --> 01:52:14.697]  The New World Order, as everybody says.
[01:52:15.217 --> 01:52:17.179]  There it is right there, and then here comes Sokka's Felix.
[01:52:17.199 --> 01:52:18.681]  So there he is.
[01:52:18.921 --> 01:52:19.982]  Schmitt is talking.
[01:52:20.402 --> 01:52:22.324]  What about the structure of the world?
[01:52:22.384 --> 01:52:24.026]  The New World Order!
[01:52:24.566 --> 01:52:25.367]  As they call it.
[01:52:25.427 --> 01:52:31.992]  And he's talking about the elitist in which he works with to track, trace and database our lives.
[01:52:32.052 --> 01:52:38.136]  Before I get to Afghanistan, I just have to do this story which is completely absurd.
[01:52:38.817 --> 01:52:45.262]  There is a county out there in Denver that is now going to be charging 50 cents a bus ride.
[01:52:46.022 --> 01:52:48.905]  50 cents a bus ride for your children.
[01:52:49.778 --> 01:52:51.540]  Now that's a dollar a day, folks!
[01:52:51.781 --> 01:52:54.764]  Now you already pay your school taxes, you pay your state taxes.
[01:52:55.185 --> 01:52:56.987]  What could they be using this for?
[01:52:57.467 --> 01:52:59.210]  Well, you're not going to believe it until I tell you.
[01:52:59.470 --> 01:53:08.361]  But they're using it for a program to put GPS systems in all of the buses in that school's county.
[01:53:08.661 --> 01:53:09.302]  Isn't that lovely?
[01:53:09.542 --> 01:53:22.597]  You not only pay the school taxes, but you're also going to be paying a dollar a day per child on top of that towards a GPS system in all of the buses in which your child will be given a card and he will swipe.
[01:53:22.617 --> 01:53:27.582]  So they're going to be tracking, tracing, and databasing your child on the school bus.
[01:53:28.083 --> 01:53:29.064]  Let me repeat that for you.
[01:53:29.664 --> 01:53:32.967]  On the school bus, there is nowhere to go.
[01:53:33.087 --> 01:53:42.075]  Meanwhile, we just have President Obama inviting the Mexican president to stand on the White House lawn and denounce Arizona's state law.
[01:53:42.918 --> 01:53:47.343]  So let me just read this article really quickly and then we're going to get into the situation in Afghanistan.
[01:53:47.664 --> 01:53:51.388]  Douglas County votes to charge fees for school bus rides.
[01:53:51.408 --> 01:53:52.549]  This passed 5-0.
[01:53:53.150 --> 01:54:01.179]  Parents in Colorado's third largest school district, the third largest school district, are being asked to pay if their kids want to ride the school bus.
[01:54:01.880 --> 01:54:02.681]  Think about that.
[01:54:02.761 --> 01:54:06.366]  Most of these kids with parents with jobs need to ride the school bus.
[01:54:06.386 --> 01:54:07.548]  They have to go to work.
[01:54:08.028 --> 01:54:16.119]  The Douglas County School Board voted 5-0 Tuesday night to approve a 50 cent per ride transportation fee starting next school year.
[01:54:16.139 --> 01:54:17.921]  So a dollar a day to get
[01:54:18.402 --> 01:54:25.485]  To school and back home, the buses will have Zoner GPS units to track student ridership.
[01:54:25.725 --> 01:54:29.547]  They admit it about tracking, tracing and databasing your kids.
[01:54:29.787 --> 01:54:34.969]  Students will have to use a card or a Z-Pass that will track their use of the bus.
[01:54:35.329 --> 01:54:38.950]  Douglas County schools will have to pay $221,000 in three equal installments over the next three years.
[01:54:43.459 --> 01:54:46.743]  So about $700,000 a year for the next three years.
[01:54:46.903 --> 01:54:51.809]  $2.1 million to fully implement the GPS tracking technology.
[01:54:52.189 --> 01:54:55.633]  That cost covers the system as a whole.
[01:54:55.934 --> 01:54:58.357]  Oh, we get to pay for our slavery.
[01:54:58.417 --> 01:54:59.738]  How lovely!
[01:55:00.379 --> 01:55:04.844]  And that kind of dovetails in with UC Berkeley asking incoming students for DNA.
[01:55:05.504 --> 01:55:08.368]  If you're going to Berkeley, folks, refuse the DNA.
[01:55:08.628 --> 01:55:09.268]  Just say no.
[01:55:09.689 --> 01:55:11.771]  Say, you know what, I don't think I'm going to be part of that.
[01:55:12.172 --> 01:55:19.599]  If you really want me to spend $40,000 this year or this semester at your school, maybe you don't take the cotton swab.
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:20.340]  All right.
[01:55:21.421 --> 01:55:22.562]  Now let's get into Afghanistan.
[01:55:23.399 --> 01:55:36.645]  Alex Jones, last week on his program, played the Geraldo Fox News clip in which they just come out and admit, yeah, we're protecting the opium fields, we're working with the farmers to protect you from Al-Qaeda.
[01:55:36.765 --> 01:55:41.588]  Meanwhile, it is literally the same network that was caught in the Iran-Contra affair.
[01:55:41.828 --> 01:55:42.948]  Do you not understand?
[01:55:43.028 --> 01:55:47.351]  Robert Gates was involved in that, and now he's our Secretary of Defense.
[01:55:47.611 --> 01:55:49.712]  We're not leaving any time soon.
[01:55:50.717 --> 01:55:51.898]  And this is going to continue.
[01:55:52.058 --> 01:55:55.241]  Afghan prosecutor issues arrest warrant for U.S.
[01:55:56.042 --> 01:55:58.364]  Army officer over killing police.
[01:55:59.144 --> 01:56:00.125]  So why is this important?
[01:56:00.145 --> 01:56:01.226]  Well, this dovetails into it.
[01:56:01.486 --> 01:56:09.213]  Any of the local authorities that try to put a stop to any of these militant activities that are ruining their country, they just get gunned down by who?
[01:56:09.553 --> 01:56:12.075]  By U.S.-backed militant forces.
[01:56:12.115 --> 01:56:13.797]  What do you mean U.S.-backed militant forces?
[01:56:13.997 --> 01:56:14.858]  Well, these forces
[01:56:15.558 --> 01:56:18.840]  That went in and shot the local police chief.
[01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:19.961]  Guess where they were training?
[01:56:20.301 --> 01:56:21.722]  Camp Gekko!
[01:56:22.523 --> 01:56:23.684]  What is Camp Gekko?
[01:56:23.844 --> 01:56:23.984]  Oh!
[01:56:24.684 --> 01:56:26.465]  It's just the spot for the CIA and U.S.
[01:56:26.505 --> 01:56:35.952]  Special Forces to run their operations and clothe and militarize and give tanks to these very criminal militants.
[01:56:36.392 --> 01:56:37.493]  We're going to come back after this.
[01:56:37.573 --> 01:56:39.414]  I am Jason Burmas sitting in for the final hour.
[01:56:39.514 --> 01:56:40.895]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:56:41.155 --> 01:56:44.497]  We are live at InfoWars.com and streaming at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:56:51.184 --> 01:56:54.167]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:56:55.088 --> 01:56:57.811]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:00.478 --> 01:57:04.441]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:57:04.661 --> 01:57:10.706]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:57:11.086 --> 01:57:18.172]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:57:18.472 --> 01:57:23.056]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:57:23.336 --> 01:57:25.478]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:31.823]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:57:32.043 --> 01:57:34.666]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:57:34.686 --> 01:57:34.846]  Call us!
[01:57:47.717 --> 01:57:48.258]  We're good to go.
[01:58:04.423 --> 01:58:05.364]  Tyranny is here.
[01:58:05.684 --> 01:58:09.327]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:58:09.367 --> 01:58:11.829]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:58:11.849 --> 01:58:17.293]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:58:17.713 --> 01:58:23.958]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:58:24.378 --> 01:58:29.921]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:58:30.321 --> 01:58:34.023]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:58:34.523 --> 01:58:38.545]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:58:38.826 --> 01:58:44.328]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:58:44.769 --> 01:58:47.750]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:58:48.311 --> 01:58:49.751]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:58:50.292 --> 01:58:50.732]  It's here.

[01:59:00.555 --> 01:59:04.798]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:59:05.118 --> 01:59:05.719]  Number 1.
[01:59:06.039 --> 01:59:09.181]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:59:09.462 --> 01:59:10.002]  Number 2.
[01:59:10.322 --> 01:59:14.866]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:15.206 --> 01:59:15.646]  It's true.
[01:59:15.946 --> 01:59:20.510]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:20.830 --> 01:59:21.350]  Number 3.
[01:59:21.651 --> 01:59:24.933]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:25.233 --> 01:59:28.916]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:29.136 --> 01:59:29.696]  Number 4.
[01:59:29.936 --> 01:59:32.297]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:32.697 --> 01:59:36.078]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:36.378 --> 01:59:36.578]  Number 5.
[01:59:37.158 --> 01:59:41.079]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:41.299 --> 01:59:46.081]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:46.361 --> 01:59:50.382]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:50.542 --> 01:59:52.083]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:52.323 --> 01:59:56.924]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:59:57.704 --> 01:59:57.764]  877-327-0365.
[02:00:07.911 --> 02:00:08.652]  Welcome back!
[02:00:08.692 --> 02:00:09.272]  You found it!
[02:00:09.332 --> 02:00:13.375]  It is the tip of the spear in the InfoWars, the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:13.435 --> 02:00:15.437]  I am Jason Burma, sitting in for the final hour.
[02:00:15.477 --> 02:00:21.261]  If you missed any of the program, remember we rebroadcast in about 27 minutes only at InfoWars.tv.
[02:00:21.681 --> 02:00:22.081]  FrontSight.com.
[02:00:22.101 --> 02:00:29.868]  We're going to get to the latest information on Afghanistan, on CIA involvement with the Taliban, with Al Qaeda in just a moment.
[02:00:29.888 --> 02:00:31.629]  But first I want to thank a couple of sponsors.
[02:00:31.969 --> 02:00:33.290]  FrontSight.com.
[02:00:33.310 --> 02:00:34.752]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[02:00:34.772 --> 02:00:38.635]  He has free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[02:00:38.675 --> 02:00:46.381]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at FrontSight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapon permit.
[02:00:46.841 --> 02:00:47.863]  All for pennies on
[02:01:03.541 --> 02:01:15.894]  1-800-691-6043 and this is fresh drinking water from the air up to seven and a half gallons out there and they have a seven or twelve stage filtering system.
[02:01:16.255 --> 02:01:20.419]  The tastiest and most healthy water you can possibly imagine.
[02:01:20.439 --> 02:01:21.440]  It is such a cool device.
[02:01:21.741 --> 02:01:23.823]  Ecolablue.com.
[02:01:23.863 --> 02:01:24.964]  Now we're going to go to your calls.
[02:01:25.985 --> 02:01:32.192]  But first, I really feel we need to hit these two big mainline stories that everybody seems to be ignoring.
[02:01:32.652 --> 02:01:34.054]  This was out of The Guardian over the weekend.
[02:01:34.614 --> 02:01:37.097]  Afghan prosecutor issues arrest warrant for U.S.
[02:01:37.177 --> 02:01:39.019]  Army officer over police killing.
[02:01:39.039 --> 02:01:43.063]  See, they're trying to go to the source, the heart of the issue.
[02:01:43.103 --> 02:01:43.684]  The U.S.
[02:01:43.784 --> 02:01:44.805]  military officer
[02:01:45.726 --> 02:01:50.648]  That is training these militants and authorizing these assassinations and much worse.
[02:01:50.988 --> 02:01:53.929]  Afghan soldiers patrol a Taliban stronghold in Kandahar.
[02:01:54.149 --> 02:01:57.870]  An Afghan prosecutor has issued an arrest warrant for a U.S.
[02:01:57.890 --> 02:02:00.171]  Special Forces officer over the murder
[02:02:00.811 --> 02:02:05.475]  of a police chief by U.S.-trained militia forces.
[02:02:05.535 --> 02:02:10.879]  Brigadier General Ghalam Ranjabar, the chief military prosecutor in Kabul, has accused the U.S.
[02:02:10.919 --> 02:02:12.460]  of creating an outlaw militia.
[02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:20.046]  See, they use proxy networks for plausible deniability so they don't have to get their hands dirty directly.
[02:02:20.706 --> 02:02:26.591]  Which allegedly, yes right, allegedly, shot dead Matula Kateh, the chief of police in the city of Kandahar.
[02:02:26.811 --> 02:02:34.317]  He accused American officials of refusing to hand over evidence or to permit his investigators to interview the special forces commander.
[02:02:34.678 --> 02:02:35.498]  And what's his name?
[02:02:35.759 --> 02:02:38.541]  Known to Afghans only as John or Johnny.
[02:02:38.801 --> 02:02:40.983]  He alleges sanctioned the raid.
[02:02:41.303 --> 02:02:44.527]  So they don't even say, I'm a colonel, I'm a general, this is my name.
[02:02:44.567 --> 02:02:48.211]  They give out one of the dozens of aliases to the masses.
[02:02:48.251 --> 02:02:50.514]  So again, they're not prosecutable.
[02:02:50.574 --> 02:02:52.816]  They cannot be traced back to the crime.
[02:02:53.657 --> 02:02:58.403]  This is standard operating procedure and has been for over half a century.
[02:02:59.687 --> 02:03:03.571]  The arrest warrant which has been circulated to border posts and airports is an embarrassment for the U.S.
[02:03:03.611 --> 02:03:07.956]  military, which is facing growing criticism for its links to militias controlled by who?
[02:03:08.416 --> 02:03:09.277]  Warlords!
[02:03:09.398 --> 02:03:15.164]  And of course the head warlord is Waleed Ahmed Karzai, Ahmed Karzai's brother!
[02:03:15.464 --> 02:03:17.304]  And the lead opium dealer, supported by who?
[02:03:17.545 --> 02:03:23.146]  The CIA, for the last eight years, superseding both the Bush and Obama administrations.
[02:03:23.246 --> 02:03:27.427]  In Kandahar, the militias have been accused of murder, rape, and extortion.
[02:03:27.467 --> 02:03:31.768]  Ranjeevar said an investigation found the force that killed Qatar operated from where?
[02:03:32.088 --> 02:03:33.468]  Camp Gecko!
[02:03:33.908 --> 02:03:34.208]  U.S.
[02:03:34.288 --> 02:03:36.389]  military training facility!
[02:03:36.969 --> 02:03:39.652]  In the hills outside of Kandahar, a base for both U.S.
[02:03:39.672 --> 02:03:40.653]  Special Forces and who?
[02:03:41.013 --> 02:03:42.254]  The CIA!
[02:03:42.314 --> 02:03:45.998]  There it is right there, folks, for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[02:03:46.719 --> 02:03:52.685]  If you go to Kandahar, people say these guys pretend to be interpreters, but they carry out night raids and assassinations, said Ranjabar.
[02:03:52.905 --> 02:03:55.187]  We hear lots of strange and shocking stories.
[02:03:55.888 --> 02:04:08.180]  But according to the Afghan account, the militia known locally as Kandahar Strike Force, or the Kandahar Special Group, arrived in the courthouse last June with U.S.-supplied uniforms, vehicles, and weapons!
[02:04:08.881 --> 02:04:09.782]  And who are they linked to?
[02:04:09.882 --> 02:04:14.987]  Again, Karzai's brother, Amidwali Karzai.
[02:04:15.067 --> 02:04:17.309]  It's all here in black and white.
[02:04:17.429 --> 02:04:18.950]  When are we going to wake up?
[02:04:19.651 --> 02:04:24.278]  And then the New York Times does this puff piece which intercedes with this information.
[02:04:24.518 --> 02:04:25.660]  Despite doubts, U.S.
[02:04:25.720 --> 02:04:27.042]  still uses private spies.
[02:04:27.603 --> 02:04:28.625]  Where were you doubting this?
[02:04:29.105 --> 02:04:34.453]  The military industrial complex always uses Blackwater, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon.
[02:04:35.074 --> 02:04:36.496]  to carry out some of their dirty work.
[02:04:36.716 --> 02:04:54.655]  Top military officials have continued to rely on a secret network of private spies who have produced hundreds of reports from deep inside Afghanistan and Pakistan, according to American officials and businessmen, despite concerns among some in the military about the legality of the operation, because it is illegal!
[02:04:55.336 --> 02:04:55.796]  Illegal!
[02:04:56.477 --> 02:05:14.493]  Earlier this year, government officials admitted that the military had sent a group of former Central Intelligence Agency officers, notice that, former Central Intelligence Agency officers, and retired special operations troops, mercenaries, folks, into the region to collect information, some of which was used to track and kill people suspected of being militants.
[02:05:15.334 --> 02:05:22.080]  Interviews with more than a dozen current and former government officials and businessmen, and an examination of government documents, tell the story!
[02:05:23.141 --> 02:05:28.286]  Under Pentagon rules, the Army is not allowed to hire contractors for spying, but they are.
[02:05:28.867 --> 02:05:35.133]  But of course, military officials said that General David H. Petraeus, the top commander in the region, signed off on the operation in January of 2009.
[02:05:36.946 --> 02:05:42.967]  There were prohibitions against intelligence gathering, including hiring agents to provide information about enemy positions in Pakistan.
[02:05:43.147 --> 02:05:53.130]  And again, if you watch Invisible Empire, we have one of the main contractors there talking about the contracting, talking about Petraeus' coin strategy.
[02:05:53.310 --> 02:05:55.470]  And what part of coin strategy are they talking about?
[02:05:55.870 --> 02:06:05.893]  Oh, biometrically taking the scans of everybody in a combat zone and hiring local nationals, aka the Taliban.
[02:06:06.613 --> 02:06:10.516]  And he admits that they work with the Taliban there, but the Taliban are our enemies, Jason.
[02:06:10.696 --> 02:06:11.337]  How does this work?
[02:06:11.837 --> 02:06:16.480]  And then they go on to say that this is managed, and zoom in here, managed by who?
[02:06:17.021 --> 02:06:18.202]  Lockheed Martin!
[02:06:19.332 --> 02:06:24.897]  Lockheed Martin and supervised by the Pentagon Office in Charge of Special Operations Policy.
[02:06:25.277 --> 02:06:30.841]  Lockheed Martin running the secret spy network that interconnects with U.S.
[02:06:30.861 --> 02:06:37.026]  Special Forces and the CIA where they go murder local police officials.
[02:06:37.106 --> 02:06:39.288]  All right, I said I'd go to your call, so we're going to hit it up.
[02:06:39.568 --> 02:06:40.469]  We're taking your calls.
[02:06:40.789 --> 02:06:42.090]  Pastor in Ohio.
[02:06:42.131 --> 02:06:43.311]  Pastor, you're on the line.
[02:06:44.572 --> 02:06:48.816]  Yes, I was calling earlier when Alex had his guest on, but
[02:06:49.255 --> 02:07:13.335]  One of the things, I was listening to what you were saying, one of the things you were talking about, deception, we just, our Columbus, Ohio Mayor just met with Barack Obama about closed doors, as a matter of fact, him and Newark, New Jersey Mayor and Minneapolis, Minnesota Mayor, they all met with him this past week.
[02:07:14.376 --> 02:07:16.778]  Yesterday, talking about terrorism.
[02:07:17.398 --> 02:07:28.927]  Now, they're bringing up Somalians that live in the Columbus area and stuff, but the problem is, it's all, it was a matter of national security.
[02:07:29.708 --> 02:07:39.515]  And with all the things that, you know, you guys have been allowing us, the people, to know, and you guys are sharing your knowledge with us, as far as everything that's going on around the world.
[02:07:40.327 --> 02:07:46.410]  You know, I just want to, first of all, praise you, you guys, for what you're doing, because more and more people are waking up.
[02:07:47.030 --> 02:07:54.533]  Well, Pastor, listen, I appreciate the call, and there has been an effort to really demonize Somali pirates around the world.
[02:07:54.613 --> 02:07:57.194]  And, say, those Somali pirates, they're terrorists now.
[02:07:57.254 --> 02:07:58.134]  Everybody's a terrorist.
[02:07:58.154 --> 02:07:59.535]  There's no other terms out there.
[02:07:59.735 --> 02:08:01.876]  You do something bad, you're a terrorist.
[02:08:02.256 --> 02:08:09.301]  So they may be using them as the next scapegoat, the next patsy in their false flag operations, and we have to be very wary of that.
[02:08:09.401 --> 02:08:10.261]  Appreciate the call.
[02:08:10.302 --> 02:08:11.883]  John in Ohio.
[02:08:11.943 --> 02:08:12.643]  John, you're online.
[02:08:13.264 --> 02:08:17.847]  Yeah, I've been waiting to talk to Alex, too, but I can talk to you in a minute or two.
[02:08:17.887 --> 02:08:23.650]  Just wouldn't it be silly to think that my disagreements on certain points could be developed that way.
[02:08:23.690 --> 02:08:30.155]  Something like WSWS.org or Workers.org, having a program uninterrupted for a year might do it.
[02:08:31.339 --> 02:08:44.368]  I wanted to make the point that I think Alex and this program is really fighting the IMF, the World Bank, the CIA, the military-industrial complex on half of its positions, but is absolutely strongly supporting them on the other half.
[02:08:44.888 --> 02:08:46.009]  Hold on, let's stop.
[02:08:46.349 --> 02:08:49.031]  What are we possibly supporting on the IMF?
[02:08:49.692 --> 02:08:52.313]  What are we possibly supporting on global governance?
[02:08:52.333 --> 02:08:53.854]  What are we possibly supporting?
[02:08:54.075 --> 02:08:57.377]  You're not going to have that much time, so give me at least one well-put example, sir.
[02:08:58.362 --> 02:09:03.651]  Well, I've got about ten, but if you're talking about when Alex uses an example of
[02:09:04.483 --> 02:09:12.565]  Uh, censorship and all the constantly, uh, piggybacks on the, uh, uh, corporate media's bashing of, uh, Chavez rather than the country right next door.
[02:09:12.725 --> 02:09:13.465]  Oh, come on!
[02:09:13.485 --> 02:09:14.506]  Let's stop, John!
[02:09:15.066 --> 02:09:16.726]  Chavez is a dictator!
[02:09:16.886 --> 02:09:22.388]  Out and out he's stopped media companies throughout his country over the last twelve months openly.
[02:09:22.568 --> 02:09:26.549]  I feature him as one of my dictators very briefly in Invisible Empire.
[02:09:26.589 --> 02:09:28.249]  Has Chavez done some good things?
[02:09:28.589 --> 02:09:32.010]  Sure he's done some good things out there, but he is a dictator!
[02:09:32.250 --> 02:09:33.911]  You can't vote him out of power.
[02:09:33.991 --> 02:09:34.911]  That's not freedom.
[02:09:35.131 --> 02:09:37.433]  That's not a constitutional republic.
[02:09:37.853 --> 02:09:39.614]  I'm not pro-communist, man.
[02:09:39.814 --> 02:09:40.894]  And neither is Alex Jones.
[02:09:40.914 --> 02:09:45.717]  So that's not running for the IMF and the World Bank to point out that he's not good either.
[02:09:46.137 --> 02:09:53.300]  That Ahmadinejad, although he speaks some truth, he talks 9-11 truth, he talks about some truth, he should be able to be a sovereign nation and be left alone.
[02:09:53.580 --> 02:09:55.221]  He's not great either.
[02:09:55.581 --> 02:09:57.082]  I just can't agree with this stuff, John.
[02:09:57.122 --> 02:09:57.522]  I'm sorry.
[02:09:57.602 --> 02:09:58.963]  Nick in Arkansas, you're on the line.
[02:10:00.604 --> 02:10:00.864]  Yes, sir.
[02:10:02.458 --> 02:10:03.238]  Jason, can you hear me?
[02:10:03.418 --> 02:10:04.018]  Yes, sir.
[02:10:04.058 --> 02:10:04.539]  Sorry about that.
[02:10:05.119 --> 02:10:08.840]  Listen, I just want to tell you I just saw Invisible Empire.
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:10.880]  We got the DVD burners fired up.
[02:10:11.921 --> 02:10:12.601]  Great movie.
[02:10:13.681 --> 02:10:19.643]  For anybody who hasn't watched it or doesn't really know much about the New World Order, this is super crash course in the New World Order.
[02:10:20.563 --> 02:10:22.984]  And I'm really excited about what's going on.
[02:10:23.144 --> 02:10:24.644]  Rand Paul winning in Kentucky.
[02:10:25.024 --> 02:10:26.085]  That is so awesome.
[02:10:26.225 --> 02:10:27.005]  It's awesome!
[02:10:27.968 --> 02:10:32.075]  Blanche Lincoln seems to be doing a runoff here in Arkansas.
[02:10:32.395 --> 02:10:34.118]  I'm happy to report about that.
[02:10:34.158 --> 02:10:35.400]  Hopefully we can get her out.
[02:10:36.068 --> 02:10:42.332]  Do you know of any candidates in this area that are pro-gun, pro-libertarian, against the New World Order?
[02:10:42.772 --> 02:10:47.274]  Not off the bat in Arkansas, but I will say this, we are having great victories.
[02:10:47.294 --> 02:10:53.078]  And with Arlen Specter out, Arlen Specter has been a staple of the Senate for decades right now.
[02:10:53.138 --> 02:10:54.919]  That is a huge victory.
[02:10:55.079 --> 02:11:00.562]  It shows the global awakening is also taking place, not just around the globe, but in this country.
[02:11:00.962 --> 02:11:06.706]  And all the subversion by Fox News trying to take over the Tea Party events isn't going to work.
[02:11:06.746 --> 02:11:21.656]  We're going to continue to put our people into office and at these rallies it would be great if people got a copy of Don't Tread On Me and Invisible Empire and made copies of those films and handed out hundreds and thousands of those films because that's how we're going to get the information out.
[02:11:21.916 --> 02:11:28.281]  That's how we show what the quote-unquote New World Order is, how it is a push, an ideal
[02:11:28.801 --> 02:11:30.082]  For a global government.
[02:11:30.122 --> 02:11:31.783]  Who was talking about that global government today?
[02:11:32.043 --> 02:11:32.704]  Brzezinski!
[02:11:32.744 --> 02:11:35.445]  And of course, Brzezinski is featured in the film.
[02:11:35.565 --> 02:11:36.566]  Appreciate the call, Nick.
[02:11:36.846 --> 02:11:37.947]  Stephen, in Florida.
[02:11:37.967 --> 02:11:38.647]  Stephen, you're online.
[02:11:40.288 --> 02:11:41.949]  Yeah, hey, good afternoon, Jason.
[02:11:43.850 --> 02:11:44.150]  Hang on.
[02:11:45.071 --> 02:11:45.611]  Okay, there we go.
[02:11:45.651 --> 02:11:46.672]  Alright, what's on your mind, Stephen?
[02:11:47.593 --> 02:11:48.733]  Hey, a couple things.
[02:11:48.853 --> 02:11:56.458]  First of all, Alex had Gary Franchi with Restore the Republic on a couple days ago and did a really good interview.
[02:11:56.983 --> 02:12:00.446]  And I get Gary's reality report.
[02:12:00.466 --> 02:12:02.187]  It's an email report he sends out.
[02:12:02.228 --> 02:12:02.948]  It's really good.
[02:12:03.709 --> 02:12:06.871]  And in the latest one, I wanted to ask you about this, see what you think.
[02:12:07.632 --> 02:12:23.125]  He was talking about the Arizona immigration bill, and he said after further looking into it, he's changed his position and believes based on the wording in that bill, it's actually a backdoor for the federal government to come in
[02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:31.565]  Do what that bill calls for for immigrants, for illegals, for anybody in the United States, just like the Patriot Act does with so-called terrorists.
[02:12:31.665 --> 02:12:44.533]  Well, I gotta tell you, Stephen, when it was first introduced to me and I didn't know much about it, I said that very same thing, that a lot of these laws look good on the surface, but they're a backdoor for global governance and federal control, so I'm gonna have to take a look at it, but I don't know.
[02:12:45.053 --> 02:12:56.979]  As far as I know, the way it's being carried out right now, if they pull somebody over and they appear to be an illegal immigrant, I don't think it's a bad thing to check if they have a consular matricular card, or they indeed are a citizen, and if not, they send them over the border.
[02:12:57.019 --> 02:12:57.840]  I think that is a good thing.
[02:12:58.080 --> 02:12:58.800]  Appreciate the call.
[02:12:58.820 --> 02:13:01.682]  Before I go to Jim in Illinois and Dalton in Georgia,
[02:13:02.202 --> 02:13:05.125]  I want to go back to that caller that was pro-communist for a moment.
[02:13:05.165 --> 02:13:07.127]  This is what happens with communism.
[02:13:07.167 --> 02:13:11.371]  This headline, China organ trafficking trial exposes grisly trade.
[02:13:11.612 --> 02:13:14.695]  And throughout this, they try to make it look, you know, kind of sexy.
[02:13:14.735 --> 02:13:18.138]  And this guy who was trafficking organs, he's a good guy, actually.
[02:13:18.438 --> 02:13:19.940]  He never sold bad organs.
[02:13:20.180 --> 02:13:23.941]  And it tells you a Beijing court is prosecuting a man for illegal organ trafficking.
[02:13:23.981 --> 02:13:32.184]  Local media reported putting the spotlight on a grisly black market in body parts in a country where the demand for transplants far outstrips supply.
[02:13:32.224 --> 02:13:34.905]  And he's a big hero and he's being prosecuted by the government.
[02:13:35.145 --> 02:13:39.507]  But at the end, they admit where is the most organ harvesting coming from?
[02:13:40.458 --> 02:13:42.421]  Well, from prisons in China!
[02:13:42.641 --> 02:13:46.145]  However, the majority of organs from transplant are still where?
[02:13:46.666 --> 02:13:49.710]  Harvested from executed criminals, the paper said.
[02:13:49.750 --> 02:13:57.059]  Beijing hopes the new system will end both live transplants and taking organs from prisoners, which makes senior officials uncomfortable.
[02:13:57.199 --> 02:13:57.559]  Hi, thanks.
[02:13:57.579 --> 02:13:59.120]  I've heard recently here about the illegal immigration thing.
[02:14:26.308 --> 02:14:33.092]  You know, I live in Chicago and you guys, uh, I don't know if you've had any calls from people from Chicago or not, but let me just tell you something.
[02:14:33.112 --> 02:14:38.476]  It's so bad here where I live that they'll intimidate you until you pretty much move out of the area.
[02:14:38.536 --> 02:14:41.138]  Unless you stand up and say, no, I'm not going to have any of that.
[02:14:41.278 --> 02:14:43.960]  I'm not going to be a victim and I'm not going to be a criminal.
[02:14:44.660 --> 02:14:47.402]  Um, and recently here I was listening to,
[02:14:48.177 --> 02:15:03.084]  Two states policemen and an off duty judge or off duty cop and a judge and a guy from the National Guard talking about you will be processed one way or another.
[02:15:03.805 --> 02:15:09.488]  One way, either as a victim or another way, either is you standing up and saying, no, I won't have any more of this.
[02:15:10.048 --> 02:15:11.349]  I totally put my foot down.
[02:15:11.789 --> 02:15:13.089]  I'm not going to be the victim anymore.
[02:15:13.750 --> 02:15:16.071]  And in that case, when you stand up for your rights and say no,
[02:15:17.273 --> 02:15:18.434]  Uh, you're a criminal.
[02:15:18.994 --> 02:15:20.214]  Um, and they laughed about it.
[02:15:20.854 --> 02:15:31.078]  And the thing was that they were all talking about how the state police and Illinois National Guard here, uh, have been working in conjunction with Mayor Daley's office.
[02:15:31.198 --> 02:15:36.179]  And that, that I'm going to tell you this right now, and this is a prediction and I hope you guys are recording this.
[02:15:36.580 --> 02:15:40.041]  Illinois is going to be the first police state in the United States.
[02:15:40.101 --> 02:15:40.941]  And how do I know that?
[02:15:41.381 --> 02:15:43.762]  Because the judge that was sitting at that bar,
[02:15:44.349 --> 02:15:45.630]  at that local establishment.
[02:15:45.650 --> 02:15:48.711]  It wasn't a bar, but it was like a drinking and dining establishment.
[02:15:49.371 --> 02:15:54.093]  He said that he sees this happening within the next 2.5 years.
[02:15:54.773 --> 02:16:06.598]  And probably even before that, within eight months, was the other guy's... Jim, I appreciate the call and we will definitely keep our eye on Illinois.
[02:16:06.678 --> 02:16:08.279]  Dalton in Georgia.
[02:16:08.319 --> 02:16:10.340]  Dalton, you're on the line.
[02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:12.641]  Let's go to Justin in Colorado.
[02:16:12.701 --> 02:16:13.341]  Justin, you're on the line.
[02:16:13.962 --> 02:16:14.923]  Hey, how's it going?
[02:16:15.023 --> 02:16:15.324]  Good.
[02:16:15.984 --> 02:16:22.952]  Okay, yes, I have a document, just following up on that bus thing you were saying in Colorado.
[02:16:23.172 --> 02:16:24.053]  Yes, yes.
[02:16:24.094 --> 02:16:25.175]  Yes, I got this.
[02:16:25.295 --> 02:16:29.019]  There's this notice I got from the school district for my sister.
[02:16:29.620 --> 02:16:35.867]  It's saying that every student district in Colorado is required to report to the Colorado Department of Education each year.
[02:16:36.947 --> 02:16:45.251]  Um, the federal government recently changed the reporting categories for student data to more accurately reflect the diversity of the country's present population.
[02:16:45.931 --> 02:16:52.514]  Under the new system, you will now be asked to indicate both the ethnicity and the racial categories for your children.
[02:16:53.134 --> 02:16:57.136]  On the data sheet, um, it has a couple, there's a new question.
[02:16:57.156 --> 02:16:59.537]  I've never seen this on any kind of ethnic question.
[02:16:59.657 --> 02:17:01.938]  It's this number one, ethnicity.
[02:17:02.098 --> 02:17:04.199]  Are you Hispanic or Latino?
[02:17:04.299 --> 02:17:04.919]  Yes or no?
[02:17:05.440 --> 02:17:06.080]  And if you're not,
[02:17:06.824 --> 02:17:12.234]  uh... indicate which ethnicity you are which is i'm thinking now uh... that they want to uh...
[02:17:14.807 --> 02:17:16.248]  They want to profile everybody.
[02:17:16.288 --> 02:17:18.149]  They want to profile areas, man.
[02:17:18.389 --> 02:17:19.990]  Listen, they want to charge you for it.
[02:17:20.010 --> 02:17:21.991]  They want to track, trace, and database you.
[02:17:22.091 --> 02:17:25.213]  Once you're in the database, that's when the massive profiling begins.
[02:17:25.233 --> 02:17:31.757]  They'll have individual profiles, community profiles, they'll have county profiles, and of course, statewide profiles.
[02:17:31.777 --> 02:17:37.080]  And they'll use this profiling information to divide and conquer.
[02:17:37.341 --> 02:17:39.322]  That's the idea, while they tax you for it.
[02:17:39.822 --> 02:17:44.644]  While they tax you for it, they are going to divide and conquer with your information.
[02:17:44.905 --> 02:17:47.626]  While they enslave your children before your very eyes.
[02:17:47.686 --> 02:17:48.846]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:17:49.127 --> 02:17:50.187]  Final segment coming in.
[02:17:50.227 --> 02:17:51.348]  I am Jason Burma sitting in.
[02:17:51.388 --> 02:17:53.629]  InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:18:01.260 --> 02:18:02.661]  Don't answer it!

[02:18:53.648 --> 02:18:53.968]  That's 800-477-9256.
[02:19:00.251 --> 02:19:02.572]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:19:02.632 --> 02:19:04.853]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:19:04.973 --> 02:19:07.774]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:19:08.174 --> 02:19:12.915]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:19:13.276 --> 02:19:17.457]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:19:17.777 --> 02:19:20.121]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:19:20.141 --> 02:19:22.664]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:19:23.025 --> 02:19:25.588]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:19:25.929 --> 02:19:33.540]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:19:33.860 --> 02:19:39.102]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:19:39.262 --> 02:19:42.063]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:19:42.103 --> 02:19:45.544]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:19:45.784 --> 02:19:46.705]  And I got news for you.
[02:19:46.865 --> 02:19:48.185]  You're everyone else.
[02:19:48.205 --> 02:19:49.226]  Invisible Empire.

[02:20:00.495 --> 02:20:01.155]  The problem.
[02:20:01.235 --> 02:20:03.276]  How do I cook food without power?
[02:20:03.796 --> 02:20:05.956]  How do I light my home with no electricity?
[02:20:06.537 --> 02:20:08.697]  How do I get emergency radio broadcasts?
[02:20:09.197 --> 02:20:10.818]  How can I make safe drinking water?
[02:20:11.698 --> 02:20:20.440]  When your power goes out, the solution for cooking, baking, home lighting, listening to the radio, and producing clean water is the Family Emergency Kit from KeroStove.

[02:20:55.360 --> 02:20:58.443]  KeroStove, for family emergency solutions.
[02:21:04.358 --> 02:21:05.059]  We are back!
[02:21:05.079 --> 02:21:06.660]  It's the final segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:21:06.700 --> 02:21:08.941]  I am Jason Burmas sitting in for the final hour.
[02:21:09.402 --> 02:21:12.764]  Alex coming back up in the rebroadcast in just about six minutes.
[02:21:12.784 --> 02:21:15.926]  Before I go to some final calls, there were two other stories I really wanted to hit up.
[02:21:16.487 --> 02:21:24.233]  We often talk about the elite's search for immortality and a lot of people will laugh at you and say, oh Jason, that's just science fiction.
[02:21:24.553 --> 02:21:24.993]  Found!
[02:21:25.173 --> 02:21:26.574]  Genes that let you live to 100.
[02:21:27.235 --> 02:21:28.255]  This is Times Online.
[02:21:28.275 --> 02:21:28.816]  They're calling them
[02:21:29.176 --> 02:21:33.539]  The Methuselah genes after the biblical character that live to be 969.
[02:21:34.059 --> 02:21:39.403]  You see folks, only about one person in 10,000 actually lives to be the age of 100.
[02:21:40.104 --> 02:21:43.106]  So these centurions have now been examined.
[02:21:43.146 --> 02:21:52.092]  They've looked at their genomes and they found out that they do have certain genes in common in 20 or 30 percentile that do allow them to live these long
[02:21:52.832 --> 02:22:00.737]  The genes are A-D-I-P-O-Q, C-E-T-P, and A-P-O-C-3.
[02:22:00.897 --> 02:22:02.398]  Read the article, it's a big one.
[02:22:02.438 --> 02:22:08.122]  And the other thing I want to caution people about is they are now promoting cancer vaccines.
[02:22:08.222 --> 02:22:16.027]  Yes, cancer vaccines that can kill tumors and in some cases, they're saying, within the next 10 years will prevent cancer altogether.
[02:22:16.147 --> 02:22:18.088]  Be very wary of this.
[02:22:18.188 --> 02:22:18.669]  Remember,
[02:22:19.229 --> 02:22:23.070]  When they gave out the polio vaccination, folks, they put SV40 in it.
[02:22:23.090 --> 02:22:33.914]  That's simian virus 40, which was a live cancer virus which people sued over after family members died and were maimed and paralyzed and all sorts of other horrific things and won those lawsuits.
[02:22:34.234 --> 02:22:38.935]  So be very cautious as they tell you, oh, we have a vaccine for cancer now.
[02:22:39.416 --> 02:22:41.056]  Andrea in Kentucky, you're on the line.
[02:22:43.037 --> 02:22:43.457]  Yes, Andrea.
[02:22:44.625 --> 02:22:48.048]  Hi, bravo on Invisible Empire.
[02:22:48.088 --> 02:22:49.410]  What an awesome movie.
[02:22:49.630 --> 02:22:50.050]  Oh, thank you.
[02:22:51.291 --> 02:22:54.755]  I just wanted to say the victory of Rand Paul here in Kentucky.
[02:22:54.875 --> 02:22:57.357]  Everybody is so hyped up.
[02:22:57.457 --> 02:23:07.567]  The local media is already saying how Jack Conway, which is his Democratic opponent, how he's going to have to run a perfect campaign.
[02:23:07.607 --> 02:23:09.669]  And he is, because he is up against
[02:23:10.938 --> 02:23:13.159]  He's up against real liberty, Andrea.
[02:23:13.219 --> 02:23:15.341]  He's up against the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[02:23:15.401 --> 02:23:16.781]  He's up against the people.
[02:23:17.081 --> 02:23:19.403]  And quite frankly, I don't think he stands a chance.
[02:23:19.463 --> 02:23:25.746]  I think it is so exciting that Rand Paul ran away with the primary in Kentucky and now we have to get him into office.
[02:23:25.766 --> 02:23:26.466]  Appreciate the call.
[02:23:26.747 --> 02:23:27.307]  Gotta jump.
[02:23:27.447 --> 02:23:28.668]  Jim in New York.
[02:23:28.748 --> 02:23:29.388]  Jim, you're on the line.
[02:23:30.228 --> 02:23:31.209]  Yes, Jason.
[02:23:31.229 --> 02:23:32.229]  My name is Jim.
[02:23:33.570 --> 02:23:36.452]  I'm trying to make this as concise as possible.
[02:23:36.872 --> 02:23:38.873]  You know, I'm listening to this day after day.
[02:23:39.451 --> 02:23:47.157]  And I'm saying to myself, what is the central theme if there is one that can coalesce our movement, you know?
[02:23:47.177 --> 02:23:54.142]  Because they've got us running in 40 different directions, you know, whether it's environmental, all this other nonsense.
[02:23:54.162 --> 02:23:55.062]  I won't go through it.
[02:23:55.643 --> 02:23:58.885]  But I received some letter today out of Nassau County.
[02:23:59.648 --> 02:23:59.748]  And
[02:24:22.390 --> 02:24:37.764]  Literally taxing you to breathe on all levels, to taxing you on how many cars you have, how many kids you have, how big your home is, how much garbage you produce, your carbon footprint, demonizing a life force, carbon dioxide, here on the planet.
[02:24:37.784 --> 02:24:48.233]  So yes, it is literally from all angles blowing out the economy with banksters running around consolidating power with the IMF and the World Bank under the G20 globalist system.
[02:24:48.513 --> 02:24:49.414]  Yes, it's not
[02:24:49.694 --> 02:24:50.536]  An easy fix.
[02:24:50.576 --> 02:24:52.180]  Yes, we are going to have to branch out.
[02:24:52.460 --> 02:24:58.213]  There is no one solution, but I gotta tell you folks, I am so encouraged to see Rand Paul.
[02:24:59.062 --> 02:25:00.823]  And as the Kentucky primary winner.
[02:25:01.243 --> 02:25:02.204]  Let's get him into Senate.
[02:25:02.224 --> 02:25:04.525]  Let's get other like-minded patriots out there.
[02:25:04.765 --> 02:25:07.966]  We've got the rebroadcast coming up in about 60 seconds.
[02:25:08.286 --> 02:25:08.767]  Don't miss it.
[02:25:08.927 --> 02:25:10.887]  Alex Jones was in live for the first three hours.
[02:25:10.948 --> 02:25:12.228]  I covered the last hour.
[02:25:12.268 --> 02:25:16.450]  We covered the Afghanistan drug trade, the corrupt military industrial complex.
[02:25:16.790 --> 02:25:18.171]  We covered Google.
[02:25:18.191 --> 02:25:19.411]  We covered the elections.
[02:25:19.732 --> 02:25:23.253]  We covered what's happening in Arizona and so much more.
[02:25:23.393 --> 02:25:26.134]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:25:26.194 --> 02:25:27.055]  God bless you all.
