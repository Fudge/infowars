[00:00:05.874 --> 00:00:06.514]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:08.215]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.935 --> 00:00:10.056]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.696 --> 00:00:11.516]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.296 --> 00:00:13.277]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.837 --> 00:00:17.678]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:22.140]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.622]  We're live, the second half of the transmission now beginning.
[00:00:33.642 --> 00:00:35.884]  We've reached the waypoint, the point of no return.
[00:00:36.544 --> 00:00:37.365]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:37.405 --> 00:00:41.708]  We're simulcasting the second half of the radio transmission at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:41.748 --> 00:00:42.729]  Again, thank you for joining us.
[00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.174]  We're taking your phone calls in the rest of this hour and interspersing it with important news.
[00:00:51.315 --> 00:00:54.017]  For those who just joined us, I've thrown the question out to listeners.
[00:00:56.325 --> 00:00:57.466]  The oil spill is serious.
[00:00:57.506 --> 00:00:59.727]  They're covering up the respiratory problems all over the Gulf.
[00:01:00.108 --> 00:01:01.028]  People are getting sick.
[00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:07.573]  They're not letting BP hired contractors wear respirators because that would alert the public to something happening.
[00:01:07.953 --> 00:01:11.616]  Like I told firefighters and police the first few days of 9-11, don't wear a mask.
[00:01:11.916 --> 00:01:14.218]  They later said there was no problem, you don't get any money.
[00:01:15.238 --> 00:01:16.420]  This is damage control.
[00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.524]  The BP CEO, Hayward, has been relieved of management duties.
[00:01:20.944 --> 00:01:22.145]  We're going to be covering that.
[00:01:22.686 --> 00:01:24.908]  But also, what is this distracting us from?
[00:01:25.608 --> 00:01:28.211]  Iran says they're going to try to run the Israeli blockade into Gaza.
[00:01:28.231 --> 00:01:28.892]  That's confirmed.
[00:01:29.412 --> 00:01:31.714]  Israel says they've got nuke subs off the coast of Iran.
[00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:32.896]  The U.S.
[00:01:33.136 --> 00:01:33.717]  and the U.N.
[00:01:33.737 --> 00:01:44.689]  are on the verge of passing sanctions to stop all ships in the different waterways, Strait of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf and other areas, going in and out of Iran.
[00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:45.430]  An act of war.
[00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.733]  They say, the Iranians say, they're going to start seizing U.S.
[00:01:48.773 --> 00:01:49.054]  ships.
[00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.780]  They're going to start grabbing other ships.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.360]  This is going to escalate quickly.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.822]  So while the media is openly admitting that war could be imminent with Iran, that's back burner.
[00:02:00.622 --> 00:02:03.843]  That's back of the newspaper even though the war is going to the front burner.
[00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:07.545]  So what else is this oil spill distracting us from?
[00:02:07.565 --> 00:02:12.486]  And of course now it's coming out to the Coast Guard for five weeks straight.
[00:02:12.586 --> 00:02:19.969]  Won't let anybody go in and even drain oil out of estuaries because the federal government is God.
[00:02:20.956 --> 00:02:26.741]  Just like Katrina, for five plus days, no food, no water, stacked up in front of the sports dome.
[00:02:27.721 --> 00:02:30.344]  On the news for three days, people saying, can I have food and water?
[00:02:30.604 --> 00:02:31.625]  And troops saying no.
[00:02:32.005 --> 00:02:34.907]  It was a laboratory experiment to see what would happen.
[00:02:35.127 --> 00:02:37.970]  They wouldn't let people walk out on the highway that was high and dry.
[00:02:39.822 --> 00:02:43.365]  Police were ordered to shoot people, they were, those cops were thrown in prison.
[00:02:44.745 --> 00:02:57.634]  That's like the White House ordering torture, and then a whole bunch of people going to prison who did torture, and then Bush comes out two weeks ago and says, I did order torture, I'd order it again, and he doesn't get in trouble, but then they send people that followed his orders to prison.
[00:02:58.094 --> 00:03:04.699]  Like the cops were ordered, use lethal force, threat continuum, do not let people walk out on these highways, the feds say.
[00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:10.078]  The cops mow a bunch of people down and were finally sent to prison last year for it.
[00:03:10.888 --> 00:03:11.949]  And they deserve to go to prison.
[00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:13.750]  You don't follow any legal order.
[00:03:14.451 --> 00:03:19.575]  I mean, if the government told you to run around and kill, you know, little kids, would you do it?
[00:03:19.635 --> 00:03:37.308]  I mean, if the government... Joseph Mengele had a German military attachment to his medical facility, and sometimes he wrote in his diary he would give little kids chocolate, ride out in his Mercedes with them, and have troops then shoot them in the head just for enjoyment in the morning.
[00:03:38.853 --> 00:03:41.599]  I think with my coffee I'll kill some children, that's what I'm into.
[00:03:44.144 --> 00:03:47.131]  Should those German shoulders get in trouble for shooting the kids in the head?
[00:03:47.171 --> 00:03:47.451]  Yes.
[00:03:47.992 --> 00:03:48.955]  It's the same thing here.
[00:03:49.847 --> 00:03:53.151]  I don't want to hear Bobby Jindal complaining that the feds won't let him clean it up.
[00:03:53.452 --> 00:03:59.479]  Go out there and say, as the governor, we're going to clean this up on our seashore.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.682]  This is state property right here.
[00:04:02.203 --> 00:04:03.404]  Coast Guard, get out of here!
[00:04:03.664 --> 00:04:05.707]  Or have the states have a convention.
[00:04:05.987 --> 00:04:08.430]  Or have the states speak up and say no.
[00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:13.553]  I mean, look, that's what the 10th Amendment's all about.
[00:04:13.573 --> 00:04:15.134]  The federal government's out of control.
[00:04:15.735 --> 00:04:28.325]  It's telling us who we can hire, who we can fire, what we can do, how big our house can be, how small it can be, when we can build a barn, when we can tear a barn down, when we can plant crops, when we can't, how many chickens we can have, everything!
[00:04:28.385 --> 00:04:37.012]  It is not the government's job, much less a remote federal government, bought and paid for by foreign interests, stealing money as fast as they can on every front.
[00:04:37.552 --> 00:04:43.518]  All right, when I come back, Randy, Rita, Robert, Sam, Ronnie, your calls directly, straight ahead, on the other side of this break.
[00:04:43.558 --> 00:04:46.060]  InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv are the websites.

[00:04:49.924 --> 00:04:55.049]  And we've got an hour and 55 minutes straight ahead and a former MI6 British intelligence officer joining us.
[00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.530]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.813 --> 00:05:05.733]  Tyranny is here.
[00:05:06.073 --> 00:05:09.734]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:05:09.934 --> 00:05:12.214]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:17.696]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:05:18.096 --> 00:05:24.357]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:05:24.757 --> 00:05:30.318]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:05:30.738 --> 00:05:34.439]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:38.900]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.701]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:05:45.161 --> 00:05:48.102]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:05:48.702 --> 00:05:50.142]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:05:50.682 --> 00:05:51.182]  It's here.

[00:08:12.246 --> 00:08:13.187]  Well, so does he.

[00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:22.112]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:23.293 --> 00:08:28.936]  Well, the mayor of Memphis admits the Napa Superhighway is real and will run through Memphis, Tennessee.
[00:08:28.976 --> 00:08:29.757]  That's coming up.
[00:08:31.226 --> 00:08:39.671]  The Icelandic Parliament has passed a law to make Iceland a internet freedom zone against the encroaching tyranny against the internet worldwide.
[00:08:39.691 --> 00:08:41.953]  That's certainly exciting.
[00:08:41.993 --> 00:08:43.073]  That is all coming up.
[00:08:44.134 --> 00:08:48.117]  The CEO of BP has stepped down.
[00:08:49.346 --> 00:08:50.848]  Tony Hayward is being demoted.
[00:08:50.868 --> 00:09:09.187]  According to Britain's Sky News, BP Managing Director Bob Dudley will take over the day-to-day oversight of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, while BP's Chairman Carl Henrich Sovenberg, the small people comment fellow, will assume major PR duties.
[00:09:09.228 --> 00:09:10.189]  Yes, that's a good idea.
[00:09:11.616 --> 00:09:13.798]  You little scum, little people.
[00:09:15.399 --> 00:09:18.022]  No respirators for you cleaning up oil.
[00:09:18.422 --> 00:09:20.084]  Then we have to admit it killing you.
[00:09:20.444 --> 00:09:20.684]  No!
[00:09:21.365 --> 00:09:23.467]  You'll be just like firefighters in New York.
[00:09:23.967 --> 00:09:26.830]  We will call you ambulance chasers when you die of lung cancer.
[00:09:27.911 --> 00:09:29.612]  When you die of asthma in one week.
[00:09:30.493 --> 00:09:31.514]  Little people.
[00:09:31.534 --> 00:09:33.616]  Alright, let's go to your phone calls as promised.
[00:09:34.096 --> 00:09:36.078]  Randy in Louisiana, you're on the air.
[00:09:36.138 --> 00:09:36.799]  Thanks for holding.
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:38.760]  Hey Alex, how you doing today?
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.961]  It's a pleasure to be on your show and talk to you.
[00:09:41.301 --> 00:09:43.541]  It's a pleasure to be part of the little people!
[00:09:44.161 --> 00:09:49.682]  Yeah, we're down here in catastrophic all-spill land, but I had a couple of things to say.
[00:09:49.722 --> 00:09:57.944]  I totally agree that it looks like they're setting up some kind of scenario like they had on 9-11 with the breathing issues around Ground Zero.
[00:09:58.844 --> 00:10:02.905]  You know, everybody should be wearing a respirator down here on these beaches cleaning this up.
[00:10:05.157 --> 00:10:13.724]  I wouldn't worry about the PR aspect of it in the media, because I want to ask these people, what's more important, your life, or playing the PR game?
[00:10:14.005 --> 00:10:20.951]  But BP's saying you will be fired if you do it, because for five weeks they've had people cleaning stuff up.
[00:10:21.251 --> 00:10:25.074]  Without them, people are getting sick, so they can't go back and say they were wrong.
[00:10:25.094 --> 00:10:31.520]  They have to say, no, you are fired if you wear a breathing apparatus, which makes them more liable, doesn't it?
[00:10:32.242 --> 00:10:32.842]  Uh, yeah.
[00:10:33.082 --> 00:10:37.663]  Well, I mean, but the thing of it is, when you're offshore, I'm an old offshore hand, okay?
[00:10:37.743 --> 00:10:44.544]  I worked drilling rigs, I was a, you know, roughneck, I worked derricks, I drilled, and also into the production end of it.
[00:10:44.984 --> 00:11:00.227]  What these people should be asking, whenever you gotta clean out a separator offshore and you have to enter this vessel, you gotta dress up in biohazard gear, you gotta sniff it out, get all the gas out of it to clean the sand and everything out, and you have to wear respirators for that, and you don't even have active oil in there.
[00:11:00.791 --> 00:11:07.573]  But my brothers and my cousins are out working this spill right now and they're telling me it's as thick as peanut butter on top of the water.
[00:11:07.853 --> 00:11:13.334]  And so you have, you know, like you said, the chemicals, benzene, it could be H2S, could be a number of things.
[00:11:13.374 --> 00:11:28.898]  And you do not want to breathe this stuff because, uh, I mean, uh, yeah, they could be threatening to fire people, but I tell you what, if I'd be down there on that beach and they threatened to fire me because I want to wear a respirator, believe me, I'd be contacting a lawyer and there'd be some lawsuits coming.
[00:11:29.758 --> 00:11:40.883]  Well, Wired Magazine, AP, Reuters, and others are reporting BP is ordering mainly the minimum-wage poor people that are out there on the beach scooping up the oil-soaked seaweed because it is the Sargasso season.
[00:11:41.523 --> 00:11:45.185]  And I look at them on the news, they're not wearing respirators.
[00:11:45.565 --> 00:11:50.027]  In most of the videos I see, they're not even wearing a mask, you know, to stop
[00:11:51.773 --> 00:11:52.234]  Any of it.
[00:11:52.814 --> 00:11:55.536]  But I guess a paper mask wouldn't stop the gas to begin with.
[00:11:55.917 --> 00:11:59.059]  And there's also all these heavy metals that are in oil.
[00:11:59.079 --> 00:12:01.402]  I mean, what is it about these companies?
[00:12:01.882 --> 00:12:04.104]  It's just they don't care how evil they look.
[00:12:04.344 --> 00:12:06.306]  They don't care how corrupt they are.
[00:12:07.207 --> 00:12:07.647]  You're right.
[00:12:07.807 --> 00:12:11.670]  And from my experience in Alfield, I really believe this was a staged event.
[00:12:12.051 --> 00:12:15.634]  I mean, for the simple fact they was on top one of the biggest fines.
[00:12:16.092 --> 00:12:23.977]  In the Gulf of Mexico in years, and then they're going to use substandard casing, substandard equipment to produce this well?
[00:12:24.378 --> 00:12:25.519]  I mean, it just don't make sense.
[00:12:25.559 --> 00:12:27.120]  They would have made all this money back.
[00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:33.644]  Why save money on the well when they'd have made all this money back once the well would have started flowing, say a month in or a month and a half.
[00:12:33.684 --> 00:12:41.870]  They would have made all their rig costs back, all the manpower labor back, and all the equipment that they put down the hole to produce this well.
[00:12:42.361 --> 00:12:44.603]  So to me it makes no sense, you know?
[00:12:44.843 --> 00:12:47.905]  Well, you know, I've been intending to do a special video report.
[00:12:47.945 --> 00:12:50.787]  I've done the research for it in the last week but haven't produced it yet.
[00:12:51.588 --> 00:12:56.591]  A 15-20 minute special report where I just go over all the evidence in one spot, but...
[00:12:57.512 --> 00:13:15.190]  It's the quotes of Halliburton, of the other two companies running the rig in concert, going back a month before, and then two weeks before, arguments beginning and saying, this is on record before it happened, and this has now been in the Coast Guard hearings, that we told them it was going to blow up,
[00:13:15.791 --> 00:13:17.353]  That this has never been done before.
[00:13:17.373 --> 00:13:23.239]  I don't understand the fracking and cement and the mud, but they're supposed to pump this down to secure the shaft.
[00:13:23.499 --> 00:13:24.920]  In fact, maybe you should explain it to me.
[00:13:25.561 --> 00:13:29.825]  And that they said, no, we're going to dump seawater in to hold the pressure down.
[00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:53.780]  Again, major newspapers, Reuters, Atlantic Monthly, have the quotes from the Coast Guard hearings, and I can't read this on air because of family reasons, but the quotes, I read some of it last week, minus the F-bombs and S-bombs, but the oil rig
[00:13:55.381 --> 00:13:59.686]  Uh, head and the ships that were there.
[00:14:00.467 --> 00:14:10.418]  So the head of the ships and that contingent, the supply ships and the head of the rig were on the phone to BP in front of all these witnesses saying, you fools!
[00:14:11.767 --> 00:14:13.448]  I told you this would blow up.
[00:14:13.948 --> 00:14:14.148]  It was 100%.
[00:14:14.268 --> 00:14:16.388]  There was no way to stop this.
[00:14:16.768 --> 00:14:17.529]  We told you.
[00:14:17.929 --> 00:14:23.250]  And so clearly, BP just told their employees it'd be like if the government wanted to ban fireworks.
[00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:25.631]  And so they went to the biggest fireworks factory in the U.S.
[00:14:25.671 --> 00:14:31.673]  and said to one of their employees, I want you to go in there with a flamethrower and start shooting at all the fireworks.
[00:14:32.073 --> 00:14:35.694]  And the guys followed the orders and walked in with a flamethrower and did it.
[00:14:35.714 --> 00:14:38.795]  And now Obama says ban fireworks factories.
[00:14:39.235 --> 00:14:40.855]  I mean, that's basically what they've done.
[00:14:41.056 --> 00:14:44.877]  Any way you cut it, they did it on purpose.
[00:14:44.977 --> 00:14:58.580]  And as I said 50-plus days ago, they're on record, Randy, saying that they want a carbon tax and that they want to bring in all their new green taxes and federalize and nationalize the oil companies.
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:05.922]  It's now happening, and BP has teamed up with them to do this, so they'll get preferential monopoly treatment.
[00:15:05.942 --> 00:15:06.742]  They've always been...
[00:15:09.991 --> 00:15:26.097]  Yeah, wasn't that convenient how all that worked out for him?
[00:15:26.377 --> 00:15:28.538]  Well, a couple of points I want to make.
[00:15:28.598 --> 00:15:32.059]  My Allfield sources, and I've got people in the Allfield family.
[00:15:32.099 --> 00:15:33.100]  I'm talking about company men.
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.300]  I'm talking about tool pushes.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.401]  I'm talking about managers of Allfield.
[00:15:41.823 --> 00:15:42.563]  They're heading out to the Gulf.
[00:15:42.804 --> 00:15:46.286]  They're going to Brazil, they're going to Africa, and other jobs.
[00:15:46.706 --> 00:15:49.688]  But one of the other things I'm hearing is they're going to open up drilling.
[00:15:50.108 --> 00:15:58.613]  They're going to open up drilling off the California coast now, so some of these rigs are going to go to California because the California economy is such in the toilet.
[00:15:59.293 --> 00:16:00.574]  So, that's the next step for you.
[00:16:00.614 --> 00:16:02.335]  That's been separately confirmed.
[00:17:26.842 --> 00:17:37.631]  Okay, again, the miracle of technology, the main networks in Minnesota, we're in Austin, we're going out on AM, FM, TV, shortwave, satellite, everything else, we're having a few glitches there.
[00:17:38.472 --> 00:17:40.073]  Randy, finish up your point.
[00:17:40.553 --> 00:17:42.255]  Yeah, still with you Alex.
[00:17:42.275 --> 00:17:46.398]  Yeah, the point is, it looks like they're going to be reversing the Louisiana economy now.
[00:17:46.418 --> 00:17:47.599]  They're going to be taking a lot of our
[00:17:48.038 --> 00:17:51.300]  Deep sea drilling now and they're going to be putting it off the coast of California.
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.782]  So that's going to put Louisiana people out of work.
[00:17:54.322 --> 00:18:00.867]  But again, we was talking about, you know, the well coming in and everything and how everything was real, you know, weird, how it came in.
[00:18:00.927 --> 00:18:01.527]  And that's true.
[00:18:02.128 --> 00:18:10.794]  And I'm sure the drilling contractor, you said the guys on the rig was just, you know, raising cane about, are you happy the well came in?
[00:18:10.874 --> 00:18:12.855]  All these guys are trained in well control.
[00:18:13.396 --> 00:18:18.581]  When, you know, these drilling contractors, they take their personnel, they train them in well control, they show them how to control a well.
[00:18:19.002 --> 00:18:21.004]  You know, every aspect of drilling a well.
[00:18:21.304 --> 00:18:29.172]  And these guys... Yeah, but I've seen little oil wells being drilled in East Texas, and there's engineers and trucks and hundreds of people running around.
[00:18:29.572 --> 00:18:33.136]  And so, I mean, there's engineers on site for small gas wells.
[00:18:34.093 --> 00:18:40.957]  Well, and the thing of it is, Alex, they knew this well was taking a kick, because some of the tests they did, they had indications they was getting gas back.
[00:18:41.177 --> 00:18:50.243]  Well, if they had pipe in the hole, what you want to do is, you want to circulate some heavier mud down that hole, vent that gas off, but you contain, you keep control of the well.
[00:18:51.119 --> 00:19:03.327]  And from what it looks like to me, they was trying to cement this well, whether they was doing a squeeze job, they was either squeezing some casein, but anyway, they was trying to put cement into a contaminated situation.
[00:19:03.708 --> 00:19:08.691]  Cement don't harden, and it don't do it's job whenever it's contaminated with gas and oil.
[00:19:09.412 --> 00:19:20.609]  So, evidently, and whatever idiot decided to displace the drilling mud out the riser and just go ahead and try to get off the well or whatever they was trying to do, he let the well come in.
[00:19:20.629 --> 00:19:22.752]  I mean, he was probably replacing
[00:19:23.406 --> 00:19:25.627]  Uh, 16 or 20 pound drill mud.
[00:19:25.687 --> 00:19:30.629]  Now, what I'm talking about is a gallon of drill mud weighing about 16 to 20 pounds.
[00:19:30.969 --> 00:19:33.531]  Replacement with seawater that probably weighs about 9.
[00:19:33.851 --> 00:19:34.951]  Well, guess what?
[00:19:34.971 --> 00:19:35.852]  No, that's what I was going to say.
[00:19:35.892 --> 00:19:41.254]  No, this is in the Coast Guard testimony that they said if you dump water in, it's
[00:19:42.133 --> 00:19:45.115]  to explode and cause a fire.
[00:19:45.175 --> 00:19:51.581]  The well is going to come in, and BP from Houston, they won't say who it was, said you will dump water in now.
[00:19:51.981 --> 00:19:55.864]  Stay briefly, Randy, then we're going to go read a Robert Samroni, but this is important.
[00:19:55.884 --> 00:19:57.545]  No, I have the Coast Guard testimony.
[00:19:57.726 --> 00:19:58.566]  Anybody can go read it.
[00:19:58.847 --> 00:20:00.047]  This is what the court found.
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.281]  Global meltdowns.
[00:20:02.461 --> 00:20:03.481]  Massive unemployment.
[00:20:03.662 --> 00:20:04.442]  Endless wars.
[00:20:04.642 --> 00:20:05.923]  A new currency crisis.
[00:20:06.123 --> 00:20:07.984]  Financially and morally bankrupt.
[00:20:08.104 --> 00:20:10.346]  A great and terrible storm is approaching.
[00:20:10.466 --> 00:20:11.927]  So what's the best way to get ready?
[00:20:12.027 --> 00:20:13.828]  To get prepared for hard times ahead?

[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:02.841]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:22:03.041 --> 00:22:08.364]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:22:08.564 --> 00:22:08.984]  I get it.
[00:22:09.104 --> 00:22:17.769]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like candy, that Social Security would
[00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:19.910]  That's not what's happening.
[00:22:20.131 --> 00:22:28.397]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:22:28.597 --> 00:22:31.859]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:22:31.999 --> 00:22:36.102]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:22:36.263 --> 00:22:37.844]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:22:37.864 --> 00:22:41.106]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[00:22:41.827 --> 00:22:45.449]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.

[00:24:07.022 --> 00:24:13.208]  Okay, I'm going to try to get through your calls a little bit quicker here, ladies and gentlemen, because I know there's a lot of key info we want to get out on air.
[00:24:13.228 --> 00:24:15.831]  We do have a special guest joining us in the next hour.
[00:24:16.631 --> 00:24:19.214]  Randy, finishing up the points you were making.
[00:24:19.254 --> 00:24:21.916]  Yes, the Coast Guard hearing with the witnesses.
[00:24:22.517 --> 00:24:25.679]  I find that the entire rig was very angry for a month.
[00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:37.467]  Two weeks before, they knew there were cracks, they knew there were problems, and that they were on record saying, it's guaranteed you're gonna have this well come in and you're gonna have a fire.
[00:24:38.448 --> 00:24:45.754]  And then once it happened, they saw all the different leaders of the three companies on their satellite phones saying, are you happy?
[00:24:45.814 --> 00:24:46.615]  You've now done it.
[00:24:47.475 --> 00:24:52.719]  So bottom line, BP should be criminally negligent for doing this.
[00:24:52.739 --> 00:24:53.760]  And the question is, why?
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.421]  Why does the media continue?
[00:24:55.441 --> 00:24:56.422]  Why do the police continue?
[00:24:56.442 --> 00:24:57.743]  What does the Coast Guard continue to say?
[00:24:58.104 --> 00:24:59.485]  BP is in charge.
[00:24:59.525 --> 00:24:59.925]  Go ahead.
[00:25:00.906 --> 00:25:02.227]  I don't I don't get it, Alex.
[00:25:02.687 --> 00:25:04.669]  And this is a plea to my governor.
[00:25:04.929 --> 00:25:07.591]  You know, Governor Jindal, please step up to the plate.
[00:25:07.992 --> 00:25:10.774]  And get involved with this and don't let the Feds control this.
[00:25:11.174 --> 00:25:12.595]  Don't let BP control this.
[00:25:12.635 --> 00:25:16.058]  I mean, you're talking about our livelihood, you know, our coasts.
[00:25:16.158 --> 00:25:18.059]  I mean, this devastates us in every way.
[00:25:18.199 --> 00:25:22.462]  I mean, you got so many people across Louisiana that love to go red fishing, speckle trout fishing.
[00:25:22.482 --> 00:25:26.265]  You got shrimpers out here that their livelihood, you know, depends on it.
[00:25:26.285 --> 00:25:31.729]  I mean, that BP exec, I heard one of them said that there's other parts of the world that he can get shrimp.
[00:25:32.667 --> 00:25:34.689]  Well, you know that DP exec that said that?
[00:25:34.729 --> 00:25:42.355]  Yeah, he still has a paycheck and everything, but our Louisiana shrimpers are just trying to get by from week to week, month to month.
[00:25:42.675 --> 00:25:47.299]  Well, my question is, what is Jindal doing in Louisiana other than complaining?
[00:25:47.339 --> 00:25:50.001]  What is Haley Barber doing in Mississippi?
[00:25:50.301 --> 00:25:51.382]  Yeah, they complain.
[00:25:51.882 --> 00:25:58.067]  They've got the authority under the 9th and 10th Amendment to protect themselves, just like Arizona does, from open borders and crime.
[00:25:58.508 --> 00:26:01.370]  They've got a right to go out there and stop that oil.
[00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:11.212]  What business does the federal government have having armed Coast Guard, who are meant to protect us from foreign powers, telling us we can't protect our industries?
[00:26:11.992 --> 00:26:12.952]  That's exactly right.
[00:26:13.112 --> 00:26:17.693]  And Governor Jindal, gotta remember, that's the whole reason he was elected in this last election.
[00:26:17.733 --> 00:26:20.414]  Because he wasn't supposed to follow the status quo.
[00:26:20.814 --> 00:26:23.474]  That he was going to do things different for Louisiana.
[00:26:23.954 --> 00:26:26.295]  You know, cut the corruption, different things like that.
[00:26:26.335 --> 00:26:27.875]  He ran on that type of platform.
[00:26:28.505 --> 00:26:33.990]  And they need to step up to the plate and just start taking charge because they could have contained this thing from the beginning.
[00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:42.238]  I'll guarantee you if the governor went out there with ships and told the Coast Guard to back off, Obama would back off.
[00:26:42.418 --> 00:26:44.219]  There's no way he could win that PR fight.
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:47.042]  But they won't do it because it's all inside baseball.
[00:26:47.062 --> 00:26:49.584]  But going back to this Coast Guard report, it's been out for two weeks now.
[00:26:50.585 --> 00:26:52.446]  Where they talk about dumping water in.
[00:26:52.746 --> 00:26:54.928]  Briefly, because I need to get to other calls and I appreciate your time.
[00:26:55.388 --> 00:27:01.571]  Briefly, what is concrete used for versus mud versus seawater?
[00:27:02.112 --> 00:27:06.214]  And why were they so mad on the rig when they said we're going to use seawater?
[00:27:06.234 --> 00:27:10.196]  I mean, the court hearing says that that wouldn't hold the pressure down and then it would explode.
[00:27:10.236 --> 00:27:11.577]  But, I mean, elaborate on that.
[00:27:12.168 --> 00:27:21.896]  Well, it sounds like the DP or whatever, the engineers, wanted to put seawater into the well, into the well bore, before they had total control of the well.
[00:27:23.177 --> 00:27:38.890]  Evidently, I don't know if they had drill pipe in the well, because, I mean, I don't know anybody that was on the rig, and I could have found this out, but evidently they was doing maybe a cement job, and cement in a string of casing or something, or they was trying to plug the top of the well so they could move
[00:27:39.324 --> 00:27:40.004]  We're good to go.
[00:28:04.755 --> 00:28:05.475]  No, that's admitted.
[00:28:05.495 --> 00:28:11.856]  They were doing a cement job and then, quote, stopped using mud and they ordered water be injected, but it wasn't engineers.
[00:28:12.697 --> 00:28:15.097]  In the record, it's engineers saying, I don't want to do this.
[00:28:15.457 --> 00:28:18.358]  It was BP in Houston telling them what to do.
[00:28:18.978 --> 00:28:29.220]  Well, that, it was insane because if they was getting a kick with gas and they knew they was getting gas, they knew dang good and well that that cement job wasn't going to hold because it was getting contaminated.
[00:28:29.642 --> 00:28:30.803]  We're good to go.
[00:28:50.959 --> 00:28:58.505]  And once this well is contained, and it's shut in, and it's cemented, then you can get off the riser pipe that's going all the way to the seafloor.
[00:28:58.905 --> 00:29:01.907]  You can even take the BOPs off.
[00:29:02.227 --> 00:29:04.849]  And what I'm understanding, they had defective BOPs.
[00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:14.636]  They should have did this a long time ago, was put a cement plug down there, and get those defective BOPs off of there, and put a good set of BOPs that didn't have leaks.
[00:29:15.457 --> 00:29:19.380]  Because what I understand, at some point in time, they were circulating rubber bits up.
[00:29:19.918 --> 00:29:21.719]  Like, you know, little bits of rubber.
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.881]  What that tells them, that's the seals.
[00:29:24.442 --> 00:29:26.163]  That's the seals inside the BOPs.
[00:29:26.203 --> 00:29:27.724]  They were circulating back up over here.
[00:29:27.744 --> 00:29:41.895]  Well, no, that's the word in the Coast Guard hearings is that there were engineers, helicopters, repair ships just buzzing around that rig when it blew up because the orders they'd been given had already screwed it up and it was leaking.
[00:29:42.175 --> 00:29:43.336]  We'll come back with more calls.
[00:29:43.356 --> 00:29:43.837]  Stay with us.
[00:29:43.857 --> 00:29:44.637]  This is Key Info.
[00:29:44.657 --> 00:29:45.158]  Straight ahead.
[00:29:51.374 --> 00:29:54.356]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.276 --> 00:29:58.077]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.319 --> 00:30:03.920]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:04.341 --> 00:30:09.303]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.663 --> 00:30:11.404]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.704 --> 00:30:16.527]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.707 --> 00:30:17.667]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.888 --> 00:30:18.628]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.988 --> 00:30:20.609]  Now, the battle starts.
[00:30:20.889 --> 00:30:21.710]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:24.031]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:24.171 --> 00:30:25.272]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:25.492 --> 00:30:26.833]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:27.033 --> 00:30:32.096]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:32.296 --> 00:30:35.498]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.879 --> 00:30:39.381]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.701 --> 00:30:40.702]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.942 --> 00:30:41.542]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.842 --> 00:30:42.743]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.943 --> 00:30:43.663]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.683 --> 00:30:44.524]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:45.603 --> 00:30:46.103]  We're good to go.
[00:31:00.319 --> 00:31:04.542]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:04.862 --> 00:31:05.483]  Number one.
[00:31:05.783 --> 00:31:08.925]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:09.206 --> 00:31:09.766]  Number two.
[00:31:10.066 --> 00:31:14.610]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:15.410]  It's true.
[00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:20.254]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:20.574 --> 00:31:21.134]  Number three.
[00:31:21.395 --> 00:31:24.677]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:24.977 --> 00:31:28.680]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:32.042]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to life.
[00:31:32.443 --> 00:31:35.825]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:36.106 --> 00:31:40.829]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:41.049 --> 00:31:45.833]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:46.113 --> 00:31:50.076]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:50.296 --> 00:31:51.317]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:52.739 --> 00:31:56.923]  The government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:31:57.143 --> 00:32:01.867]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:01.907 --> 00:32:04.729]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.
[00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:10.194]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.
[00:32:10.494 --> 00:32:13.677]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.

[00:32:21.562 --> 00:32:23.883]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[00:32:24.223 --> 00:32:30.446]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[00:32:30.726 --> 00:32:32.026]  Buy American and stay clean.

[00:32:53.597 --> 00:32:54.037]  Thank you!
[00:33:26.108 --> 00:33:30.994]  Okay, I just spent two segments with that caller because they had a lot of key info, but let's try to hurry through your calls right now.
[00:33:31.394 --> 00:33:32.956]  Rita in Illinois.
[00:33:33.957 --> 00:33:35.019]  Thank you for joining us, Rita.
[00:33:35.059 --> 00:33:35.840]  What's on your mind today?
[00:33:36.764 --> 00:33:37.264]  Hi, Alex.
[00:33:37.324 --> 00:33:39.826]  Well, you mentioned a little bit of what I was calling about.
[00:33:39.986 --> 00:33:45.490]  And then, first of all, before I say what I want to say is that, you know, 1941, there's a video out there on YouTube.
[00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:48.712]  It's called Rudolph Diesel and Henry Ford Against Petroleum.
[00:33:49.112 --> 00:33:51.534]  He made a hemp car that ran on hemp in 1941.
[00:33:51.694 --> 00:33:53.835]  It was almost indestructible.
[00:33:53.875 --> 00:33:54.796]  The video's out there.
[00:33:54.876 --> 00:33:59.519]  But, you know, the Coast Guard turns back these barges.
[00:34:00.239 --> 00:34:00.920]  Or else what?
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:01.940]  And you know what?
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.522]  Let's see if they got the stones to open up on those barges.
[00:34:04.961 --> 00:34:06.606]  It's time to either be mice or men.
[00:34:06.747 --> 00:34:07.630]  Clean the oil up.
[00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:09.194]  They're gonna die one way or the other.
[00:34:09.214 --> 00:34:12.966]  They're gonna die from the carcinogens and the poisons and all the animals are dead.
[00:34:13.450 --> 00:34:15.932]  Let's see if the Coast Guard can open fire on those people.
[00:34:16.653 --> 00:34:30.964]  But notice these lawyers with 9-11 in the deadly dust or with the deadly carcinogens that the EPA admits everybody's breathing, even inland, and BP and the Feds say, no there's no problem, you're not allowed to wear respirators.
[00:34:31.305 --> 00:34:32.826]  They love killing you slow.
[00:34:32.886 --> 00:34:39.811]  They love something they can lawyer and deny later and abscond and twist and
[00:34:40.732 --> 00:34:41.593]  Confused.
[00:34:42.934 --> 00:34:47.177]  And I just hate to see the Coast Guard put in this position.
[00:34:47.217 --> 00:34:49.538]  But the Coast Guard shouldn't follow those orders.
[00:34:49.919 --> 00:34:57.624]  I mean, if they're told by the Obama people and the BP people, hey, we want this to be as bad as it can be, obviously they're not telling them that, but that's the main reason.
[00:34:57.864 --> 00:34:59.545]  We want to get our carbon tax through.
[00:34:59.885 --> 00:35:01.467]  It's a diversion from the economy.
[00:35:01.747 --> 00:35:05.089]  It's a diversion from our preparations with war, with Iran.
[00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:08.852]  You know, they just shouldn't follow those orders to go up and stop
[00:35:09.412 --> 00:35:12.135]  Local communities out there cleaning up the oil themselves.
[00:35:12.436 --> 00:35:15.599]  This just shows how we have no freedom in this country.
[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:16.861]  Anything else, Rita?
[00:35:17.537 --> 00:35:19.898]  Well, didn't you say, he who fires first, loses?
[00:35:19.978 --> 00:35:21.599]  Make them fire first, because you know what?
[00:35:21.639 --> 00:35:23.580]  These people are just going to clean up the oil.
[00:35:23.981 --> 00:35:25.361]  Enough dead animals already.
[00:35:25.942 --> 00:35:26.822]  Enough dead animals.
[00:35:26.842 --> 00:35:28.203]  Well, I know what the feds will do.
[00:35:28.243 --> 00:35:29.103]  They won't fire.
[00:35:29.143 --> 00:35:35.707]  They'll wait until the boats land and then they'll arrest the people and tell them you're going to go to jail for 20 years if you don't plead guilty.
[00:35:36.247 --> 00:35:39.109]  But it just, look, the government wants us as prisoners.
[00:35:39.509 --> 00:35:40.210]  Everything
[00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:42.891]  Everything has to be okay by them.
[00:35:42.991 --> 00:35:46.233]  We are the opposite of what America was founded to be.
[00:35:46.594 --> 00:35:47.815]  This is cancer.
[00:35:48.075 --> 00:35:51.177]  We have to get rid of this out-of-control federal government.
[00:35:51.537 --> 00:35:53.138]  It is not run by the federal government.
[00:35:53.378 --> 00:36:02.444]  It is run by offshore interests that have gotten away with murder, who've committed millions of different types of crimes over and over again, and so they've said, hey, let's just go for broke.
[00:36:02.884 --> 00:36:04.746]  We have to realize the stakes here.
[00:36:05.026 --> 00:36:07.628]  We have an enemy that knows no limit.
[00:36:08.408 --> 00:36:12.370]  That is completely naked in their over-the-top corruption.
[00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:13.331]  I appreciate your call.
[00:36:13.871 --> 00:36:15.512]  Let's go to Robert in West Virginia.
[00:36:15.852 --> 00:36:16.692]  Robert, you're on the air.
[00:36:16.732 --> 00:36:17.072]  Welcome.
[00:36:17.973 --> 00:36:19.074]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:36:19.214 --> 00:36:19.574]  Good, sir.
[00:36:21.235 --> 00:36:27.218]  Real quick, before I get into what I was going to tell you, it was breaking news on Drudge that
[00:36:28.345 --> 00:36:33.529]  There was a bomb threat called into your Austin Capitol building.
[00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:35.491]  I saw that about an hour ago.
[00:36:36.612 --> 00:36:41.656]  Now they've got metal detectors there because they grabbed some guy and he shot in the air last year.
[00:36:42.416 --> 00:36:47.740]  The feds clearly firebombed their own governor's mansion to set up a police state.
[00:36:48.641 --> 00:36:59.808]  They even tried to set us up for that, evidence showed, and then it turned out a federal informant set up people to firebomb from Austin at the RNC in Minnesota, and that came out was a federal operation.
[00:37:00.249 --> 00:37:03.230]  So this is just probably some mental patient or some Fed.
[00:37:03.791 --> 00:37:08.734]  The Feds do these bomb threats all the time just to, you know, scare their minions, but anything else?
[00:37:09.775 --> 00:37:10.075]  Yes.
[00:37:11.135 --> 00:37:14.538]  I tell you, I've been feeling like I've been living in the twilight zone up here.
[00:37:14.558 --> 00:37:18.040]  There's so much weird stuff going on, let's say.
[00:37:18.698 --> 00:37:24.280]  I've seen foreign troops up here as far as their transports.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:43.105]  They've got to be Eastern European, more of a German or Czechoslovakian or Romanian camouflage pattern with the international license plate in the front, the flat-fronted Mercedes troop transports.
[00:37:45.145 --> 00:37:48.126]  I live out in the middle of nowhere and I'm nowhere near any airport.
[00:37:48.598 --> 00:37:50.079]  You're talking about a B-52 or a B-2?
[00:38:19.662 --> 00:38:22.385]  I mean, I've seen three practices so far.
[00:38:22.405 --> 00:38:26.891]  It was so close to ground, I could see the rivets on the plane.
[00:38:27.671 --> 00:38:31.015]  Well, let me comment on that, Robert, and I appreciate your call.
[00:38:32.742 --> 00:38:38.065]  I sent Rob Dew and Jason Douglas, and I was going to have them on today, but at the end of the show, Rob Dew said, can we do it next week?
[00:38:38.085 --> 00:38:43.267]  That way I'll have time to get some of the video of the 20-plus hours they shot over four or five days.
[00:38:44.148 --> 00:38:45.929]  And he'll have time to get all the documents together.
[00:38:45.949 --> 00:38:49.891]  But he was showing me what the National Guard and regular Army gave them.
[00:38:50.331 --> 00:38:57.295]  He went to a federally sponsored Homeland Security five-day drill Sunday through Thursday in Chicago.
[00:38:58.499 --> 00:39:06.244]  And in the literature online from the Army, it said the Army will be working with local police in drug and gun interdiction.
[00:39:06.264 --> 00:39:14.829]  Remember about a year ago, Blagojevich, right before that scandal started, he was on CBS TV saying, I'm going to use troops door-to-door to confiscate guns.
[00:39:15.269 --> 00:39:19.232]  And then now, about a month ago, another state senator came out and called for that.
[00:39:20.253 --> 00:39:21.774]  So my guys go to these drills.
[00:39:22.194 --> 00:39:23.695]  The troops don't even hide it.
[00:39:24.753 --> 00:39:34.437]  Because back when I caught stuff like this on tape in the late nineties, they would find out I was there and threaten me, have police throw me off, you know, mainline streets, California.
[00:39:35.137 --> 00:39:44.981]  We had camera guys up in Hebron, Maryland, with the police walk up, in Maryland, with Marines that point machine guns at them and say, stop filming us.
[00:39:45.802 --> 00:39:50.424]  They had local kids looking for the, quote, militia people in the mock drill.
[00:39:51.397 --> 00:40:02.785]  Then last year I had a National Guard colonel on from Iowa who they admitted they were doing gun confiscation takeover drills about a lockdown Arcadia and that's in my film Police State 4 The Rise of FEMA.
[00:40:03.085 --> 00:40:06.867]  It's so important to have this film to know the tactics the program the brainwashing.
[00:40:07.768 --> 00:40:11.050]  You've got the governor last year of Tennessee.
[00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:13.552]  They had army checkpoints Marine Corps.
[00:40:15.333 --> 00:40:21.157]  I mean it was it was all the services Air Force MPs Homeland Security shutting down whole highways.
[00:40:22.679 --> 00:40:24.301]  And then the governor said, don't do that.
[00:40:24.701 --> 00:40:26.864]  And the feds said, we're going to do it anyways.
[00:40:27.144 --> 00:40:28.185]  I haven't had state reps on.
[00:40:28.946 --> 00:40:31.249]  And then we got photos and videos off the news.
[00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:32.431]  It's in my film.
[00:40:33.592 --> 00:40:37.117]  And they want to, and it's whole highways shut down, US troops searching them.
[00:40:38.246 --> 00:40:39.806]  Training the troops, it's okay.
[00:40:40.167 --> 00:40:42.007]  Training the people in the cars, it's okay.
[00:40:42.047 --> 00:40:43.428]  Training the media, it's okay.
[00:40:43.748 --> 00:40:47.889]  And telling the governor, hey boy, we don't care what you say.
[00:40:48.369 --> 00:40:51.170]  We don't care if this is scaring people in small towns and big cities.
[00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:55.411]  And it turned out it was a four-state martial law lockdown drill.
[00:40:56.371 --> 00:40:57.432]  And they're having these everywhere.
[00:40:57.872 --> 00:41:07.755]  So continuing and expanding on that, for everybody that's out there listening, Rob Dew and Jason Douglas go to Illinois.
[00:41:09.695 --> 00:41:09.838]  And...
[00:41:12.552 --> 00:41:15.374]  It was troops and police training to take on Americans.
[00:41:15.934 --> 00:41:24.919]  It was... Well, you've seen the New York Times, where it shows the Explorer Scouts, and it shows a whole bunch of photos in the New York Times article.
[00:41:24.939 --> 00:41:31.562]  They have a photo gallery, and it says, they're training to take on American terrorists and disgruntled vets.
[00:41:32.182 --> 00:41:39.406]  And then Homeland Security plays the part of disgruntled vets, and the kids come in with laser tag and kill the mock
[00:41:41.087 --> 00:41:42.928]  Vets who won't turn their guns in.
[00:41:43.448 --> 00:41:45.589]  And the New York Times is saying, isn't this great?
[00:41:46.329 --> 00:41:49.250]  Our 14-year-olds are training to take on disgruntled gun owners.
[00:41:50.851 --> 00:41:51.971]  That's what this was.
[00:41:52.312 --> 00:41:53.992]  And they let my guys in.
[00:41:54.132 --> 00:41:56.513]  They let them videotape the entire thing.
[00:41:57.294 --> 00:41:58.754]  And we're going to be covering it next week.
[00:41:59.194 --> 00:42:01.135]  Again, people are like, well, we want to see this now.
[00:42:02.436 --> 00:42:06.597]  My guys show up with 20 hours of video or more.
[00:42:07.238 --> 00:42:08.658]  I saw like six boxes of tapes.
[00:42:08.918 --> 00:42:10.239]  There's five tapes per box.
[00:42:12.534 --> 00:42:13.456]  Probably 30 hours.
[00:42:13.476 --> 00:42:14.377]  I don't know how many hours.
[00:42:14.397 --> 00:42:15.800]  We've got a lot of video.
[00:42:22.216 --> 00:42:23.056]  I mean, what do you say?
[00:42:23.076 --> 00:42:27.597]  I have been to the drills where they're training to take on the American people.
[00:42:27.617 --> 00:42:33.399]  And of course, over a year ago, we got the Secret Homeland Security and MIAC reports that law enforcement sent us who were concerned.
[00:42:34.339 --> 00:42:36.580]  And in those reports, the media confirmed were real.
[00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:44.782]  The number one threat to America is veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, landowners, libertarians, and anti-war activists for that matter.
[00:42:45.322 --> 00:42:48.165]  Anybody who is not for the New World Order is an enemy.
[00:42:48.465 --> 00:42:49.686]  Ron Paul, you name it.
[00:42:50.167 --> 00:42:50.908]  Aaron Russo.
[00:42:51.428 --> 00:42:52.509]  The list goes on and on.
[00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:54.151]  This is what they teach.
[00:42:54.631 --> 00:42:57.134]  This whole police state is for you.
[00:42:57.474 --> 00:42:58.555]  You are the slaves.
[00:42:59.136 --> 00:43:02.920]  Alright, we're gonna go to Sam, Ronnie, Mike, and Anthony before our guest comes on.
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:05.843]  I got a bunch of other news we haven't even gotten to yet.
[00:43:07.662 --> 00:43:11.084]  But yes, they've got foreign troops crawling all over the U.S.
[00:43:11.665 --> 00:43:14.527]  and they've been incrementally increasing their numbers for decades.
[00:43:14.567 --> 00:43:16.508]  And last year they had NLE09.
[00:43:18.369 --> 00:43:26.074]  And it said in the FEMA press release, troops from all these foreign countries, mainly Eastern Europe, are training to fight American terrorists.
[00:43:26.795 --> 00:43:34.760]  I've seen articles in the Washington Post eight years ago, it's in my film Road to Tyranny, where it said Mexican and Canadian troops will be used to fight American terrorists.
[00:43:36.246 --> 00:43:42.508]  And then you noticed at the Olympics it was in the news that the army was running checkpoints and now they're going to stay and U.S.
[00:43:42.548 --> 00:43:43.868]  troops were used in Canada.
[00:43:44.268 --> 00:43:46.169]  See, this is the world government.
[00:43:46.489 --> 00:43:47.770]  This is the mercenaries.
[00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:55.272]  This is BP all over the Gulf Coast telling camera people they can't videotape.
[00:43:55.492 --> 00:43:56.612]  People say, well, what's your right?
[00:43:56.632 --> 00:43:57.513]  Well, what's your authority?
[00:43:57.953 --> 00:44:00.393]  My authority is I am God.
[00:44:01.334 --> 00:44:02.654]  And the media follows their orders.
[00:44:02.694 --> 00:44:05.055]  Just some guy in a baseball cap walks up and says, get out of here.
[00:44:07.165 --> 00:44:12.958]  And if that guy in the baseball cap calls the cops and postures right like he's the boss, the cops will get down and lick his boots.
[00:44:13.379 --> 00:44:16.266]  But citizens that grovel to police...
[00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:21.633]  A lot of cops now on steroids will just break your nose for fun and then charge you with assaulting them.
[00:44:21.893 --> 00:44:32.000]  Because you, like a dog that rolls over, you ever seen a dog that's cowed, you walk over to it and it rolls over on its belly and, you know, grovels and maybe even squirts a little bit?
[00:44:32.501 --> 00:44:35.963]  That's a sign of I totally submit, I'm scared, I'm peeing on myself.
[00:44:36.503 --> 00:44:37.584]  That's what the American people do.
[00:44:37.624 --> 00:44:38.605]  We just see government
[00:44:39.285 --> 00:44:41.146]  And we just, oh, you want more taxes?
[00:44:41.166 --> 00:44:42.267]  You want to tell me what I can do?
[00:44:42.327 --> 00:44:43.248]  You want to run my life?
[00:44:43.308 --> 00:44:44.208]  You want to be my god?
[00:44:44.429 --> 00:44:45.409]  Here, let me roll over.
[00:44:45.649 --> 00:44:47.451]  I don't want Chris Matthews to call me a terrorist.
[00:44:47.671 --> 00:44:50.012]  And you just roll over and submit.
[00:44:51.073 --> 00:44:58.638]  And maybe that should be the new national symbol, not the bald eagle, but a man on his back in a fetal position with a little puddle of urine.
[00:44:59.517 --> 00:45:01.319]  Maybe we should make an American flag like that.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.102]  And then the stripes can be yellow for urine.
[00:45:05.043 --> 00:45:05.644]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[00:45:05.664 --> 00:45:07.666]  That's what this is, you know, us urinating on ourselves.
[00:45:08.467 --> 00:45:13.092]  And the new American symbol will be a man in a fetal position peeing on himself.
[00:45:13.112 --> 00:45:16.076]  I mean, I'm sorry to get graphic, but that is what we are.
[00:45:16.596 --> 00:45:20.139]  We just, government says something, we ask, how high do we jump?
[00:45:20.179 --> 00:45:35.029]  Master, you are king, you are god, you are lord, you are master, nothing but government's good, put fluoride in my water, give me vaccines full of poisons, tell me they're good, lie to me, give me GMO food, take my property, run my life, brainwash my kids.
[00:45:37.611 --> 00:45:43.716]  I'm sorry, I mean, are we land of the free, home of the brave, or are we the land of rolling over on our back and urinating on ourselves, like a dog?
[00:45:47.222 --> 00:45:52.024]  And so, some guy in a baseball cap walks up to cops and says, kick these people out of here, they're not allowed to be here.
[00:45:52.064 --> 00:45:54.105]  And they go, yes sir, you look authoritative!
[00:45:56.406 --> 00:46:02.348]  And then, I mean, it's just, it's just to watch my fellow, and I'm not bashing police here, but police know the position you've been put in.
[00:46:02.668 --> 00:46:03.989]  You know how you've been brainwashed.
[00:46:04.029 --> 00:46:05.869]  You know how you've been encouraged to be thugs.
[00:46:06.129 --> 00:46:07.590]  You know how the thugs get promoted.
[00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:09.050]  You know the truth.
[00:46:09.711 --> 00:46:12.612]  How it's macho to slap us, the milk cows, around.
[00:46:14.537 --> 00:46:19.103]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, Alan Greenspan is saying we're going to max out our debt, we're going to lose our AAA rating.
[00:46:19.404 --> 00:46:25.672]  California, Connecticut, and other states are losing their AAA rating, which means we owe even more interest to bankers for the right to have currency.
[00:46:25.712 --> 00:46:26.673]  It's all made up out of nothing.
[00:46:27.154 --> 00:46:28.836]  Gold is an all-time record today.
[00:46:29.537 --> 00:46:42.671]  And I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this, but if you want to protect yourselves, if you want to not be completely castrated and completely under government control, I suggest you move into gold and silver at bullion prices that are extreme high quality.
[00:46:42.971 --> 00:46:46.375]  Ted is running out of the gold he has at the lower price.
[00:46:46.675 --> 00:46:47.596]  It's going to go up again.
[00:46:48.137 --> 00:46:53.060]  But then as gold goes up, he'll be able to sell you gold he bought at a lower price even as it goes up.
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:55.561]  But you need to take advantage of this now.
[00:46:55.881 --> 00:46:56.762]  Ted, good to have you on.
[00:46:56.782 --> 00:47:04.046]  You've got some news articles for us today on what's happening with gold and why this is happening and today's coin offer before we go to break and come back with calls.
[00:47:04.574 --> 00:47:16.959]  Yeah, just real quick on the news here, Kitco published with Debbie Carlson, just wrote that gold sales to record highs as investors fear winds of debt crises and future inflation.
[00:47:17.399 --> 00:47:21.521]  And they're just talking about what's going on in Europe, and that's why people are getting into that.
[00:47:22.141 --> 00:47:23.782]  Then I was also looking at MarketWatch.
[00:47:24.322 --> 00:47:28.324]  MarketWatch has gold pushes past record $1,260 an ounce.
[00:47:29.224 --> 00:47:31.865]  Bloomberg has a title right up here, China should raise its
[00:47:32.498 --> 00:47:35.661]  Uh, gold and oil holdings, uh, they're gonna do that.
[00:47:36.301 --> 00:47:41.245]  We also have, uh, the support level of gold pushed up now from that 1,100, uh, that 1,210 range.
[00:47:41.285 --> 00:47:41.886]  Now it's 1,216.20.
[00:47:41.946 --> 00:47:43.367]  And, uh, and the resistance levels at 1,270.
[00:47:43.427 --> 00:47:46.910]  Uh, we're gonna see $1,350 an ounce with this trend going the way that it is real shortly.
[00:47:56.457 --> 00:48:02.619]  And I need to say it, Alex, I don't know if I'll ever be able to buy gold again at $1,220 an ounce.
[00:48:03.319 --> 00:48:06.639]  I was hoping to get that $1,180 to buy a bunch of it again.
[00:48:06.739 --> 00:48:07.460]  I didn't get there.
[00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:12.261]  I had to settle for just touching $1,200 an ounce here about a week ago.
[00:48:12.841 --> 00:48:15.161]  And the world right now is turning to gold.
[00:48:15.462 --> 00:48:17.562]  The weird part about it is we're in July.
[00:48:17.582 --> 00:48:22.783]  It's acting more like it's October, because gold has been so strong.
[00:48:23.063 --> 00:48:25.704]  There's a lot of things that are going up in the marketplace right now.
[00:48:26.545 --> 00:48:27.345]  I think so.
[00:48:48.292 --> 00:48:51.075]  In the gold coins that people have been buying from us all these years.
[00:48:51.655 --> 00:48:55.078]  And I gotta say, you know, they deserve it.
[00:48:55.118 --> 00:48:58.241]  They're the mavericks that got into gold before all the yuppies jumped in.
[00:48:58.641 --> 00:49:00.983]  And it's nice to see that they're able to take some profits.
[00:49:01.368 --> 00:49:03.068]  And the yuppies are just now getting in.
[00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:08.550]  Now tell folks the special deals you've got today that are going to run through the weekend but probably won't be available next week.
[00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:10.210]  Well, I've got a few things.
[00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:17.472]  Again, I am offering the same deal on francs with the forecaster as I did yesterday, even after gold jumping up $15 today.
[00:49:17.512 --> 00:49:18.153]  I have the franc at $265.
[00:49:23.254 --> 00:49:30.840]  That price will go up into the $270 range after this weekend if gold holds its price, and I don't know why it wouldn't.
[00:49:32.021 --> 00:49:42.568]  I do have for sure, and my brokers don't even know this yet, but I have a small group of $20 liberties for those of you who like hundred-year-old coins that are more of a collector type.
[00:49:42.889 --> 00:49:44.230]  They're at $1,518.
[00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:47.172]  Now I need to tell you that the U.S.
[00:49:47.232 --> 00:49:49.153]  Eagle has jumped up over that $1,300.
[00:49:49.514 --> 00:49:50.014]  It's like $1,340 now.
[00:49:52.976 --> 00:49:53.657]  To buy those?
[00:49:54.257 --> 00:49:56.558]  This is less than $200 over the U.S.
[00:49:56.638 --> 00:49:57.279]  Eagle price.
[00:49:57.659 --> 00:49:59.660]  And for a $20 Liberty, that's unheard of.
[00:50:00.061 --> 00:50:03.083]  But on Monday, they'll be at $1,570 apiece.
[00:50:03.523 --> 00:50:06.405]  So if you want to take advantage of that, there's a good buy for you.
[00:50:06.425 --> 00:50:07.325]  What about buffaloes?
[00:50:07.345 --> 00:50:09.387]  You got any of those luscious buffaloes left?
[00:50:09.427 --> 00:50:11.128]  That is where I'm going next, Alex.
[00:50:11.168 --> 00:50:12.989]  I'm going to tell people to buy the buffaloes.
[00:50:13.069 --> 00:50:15.971]  Because right now, I have buffaloes and I can sell them.
[00:50:16.511 --> 00:50:20.536]  I'm one of the few dealers that do, and I can just tell you, over the U.S.
[00:50:20.616 --> 00:50:22.619]  Eagle, I think the Buffalo is a much better buy.
[00:50:22.639 --> 00:50:27.505]  What about the 5th of an ounce Franks?
[00:50:27.545 --> 00:50:33.073]  5th of an ounce Frank at $265, Alex, it's again that you can't beat that, especially considering that you're getting a full
[00:50:33.453 --> 00:50:36.435]  Yeah, most coin dealers are out of stock and have huge premiums.
[00:50:36.455 --> 00:50:38.297]  This is a great deal.
[00:50:38.317 --> 00:50:38.357]  800-686-2237.
[00:50:39.778 --> 00:50:43.241]  The brokers will be there tonight and throughout the weekend.
[00:50:43.261 --> 00:50:43.621]  800-686-2237.
[00:50:43.721 --> 00:50:50.086]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you to make sure you get the lower price because gold has gone up.
[00:50:50.406 --> 00:50:52.428]  You will get the lower price if you tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:50:52.448 --> 00:50:52.788]  800-686-2237.
[00:50:52.828 --> 00:50:53.388]  Stay there, Ted.
[00:50:53.809 --> 00:50:59.873]  I want you to be able to finish up what you were saying and on to your phone call.
[00:50:59.893 --> 00:51:00.254]  Stay with us.
[00:51:02.034 --> 00:51:05.235]  So you think the massive Gulf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe?
[00:51:05.775 --> 00:51:06.356]  Think again!
[00:51:07.116 --> 00:51:14.599]  Benzene, a toxic gas emitted from crude oil and a known carcinogen, is now airborne traveling hundreds, even thousands of miles inland.
[00:51:14.739 --> 00:51:21.721]  Whether you live near the Gulf or not, benzene and other volatile organic compounds could cause adverse reactions to those living inside your home.
[00:51:21.981 --> 00:51:30.245]  NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, came to airfiltersandpurifiers.com for answers on how to clean the air on boats aiding in the Gulf cleanup.
[00:51:30.545 --> 00:51:31.405]  Do what NOAA did.

[00:52:01.331 --> 00:52:06.195]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:52:06.295 --> 00:52:07.075]  What have we got?
[00:52:07.295 --> 00:52:09.437]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:52:09.737 --> 00:52:10.478]  A republic.
[00:52:10.758 --> 00:52:13.320]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:15.321]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:52:15.662 --> 00:52:17.563]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:52:17.683 --> 00:52:23.047]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[00:52:23.247 --> 00:52:26.910]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:52:27.250 --> 00:52:30.912]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:52:30.952 --> 00:52:31.933]  You have been warned.
[00:52:32.233 --> 00:52:33.054]  We have the facts.
[00:52:33.254 --> 00:52:34.375]  We have the Constitution.
[00:52:34.415 --> 00:52:35.295]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:52:35.315 --> 00:52:36.156]  We have common law.
[00:52:36.216 --> 00:52:38.457]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:38.737 --> 00:52:42.540]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:47.403]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:52:47.583 --> 00:52:48.904]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:52:49.084 --> 00:52:49.924]  Don't Tread on Me.
[00:52:50.165 --> 00:52:51.405]  Order it at InfoWars.com.

[00:53:52.702 --> 00:53:53.142]  MyPillow.
[00:53:53.242 --> 00:53:54.143]  For the rest of your life.
[00:54:10.778 --> 00:54:14.499]  Look, I shouldn't have to sit here and sell people on getting gold and silver.
[00:54:14.879 --> 00:54:16.680]  It's a very simple equation.
[00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:24.682]  I told people to buy it when it was $265, $280 an ounce because I knew that the central banks of the world were artificially suppressing it.
[00:54:25.162 --> 00:54:34.925]  I knew banks were inflating our currencies and that the law of finance and of economics said gold and silver and other metals would only go up.
[00:54:35.936 --> 00:54:39.518]  Now, they can manipulate for short periods, but not long-term.
[00:54:39.838 --> 00:54:46.722]  You look at the year graph, the two-year graph, the three-year graph, the four-year graph, the five-year graph, back to seven years, gold is only going up.
[00:54:47.322 --> 00:54:48.703]  I don't buy it as an investment.
[00:54:48.863 --> 00:54:50.504]  I buy it as an emergency backup.
[00:54:51.284 --> 00:54:54.226]  But it's the best thing for investment out there that I've seen.
[00:54:55.666 --> 00:54:58.169]  I mean, it's head and shoulders above everything else.
[00:54:58.690 --> 00:55:02.194]  It is the best investment, period.
[00:55:02.294 --> 00:55:06.980]  But for me, it's the best insurance policy, and I just hope that people will call and take advantage.
[00:55:07.261 --> 00:55:09.003]  Ted, what are the silver half dollars?
[00:55:09.023 --> 00:55:10.385]  What do you have in silver for folks?
[00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:16.805]  Well, obviously, silver is shooting up in price, too, and I am still holding that price of Walking Liberties down.
[00:55:17.225 --> 00:55:18.807]  They're at $9.75.
[00:55:19.247 --> 00:55:25.873]  For those of you who want to have the old bags of junk silver, they call them, or 90% silver, we have those bags, too.
[00:55:25.893 --> 00:55:32.279]  I don't know what the price is off the top of my head, because we just had silver run up, and I didn't bring that price into the studio with me.
[00:55:32.719 --> 00:55:35.403]  But if you want to pick up something like that, that's a great buy, too.
[00:55:35.683 --> 00:55:38.066]  We have the Silver Barnes very close to spot.
[00:55:38.487 --> 00:55:46.338]  You know, for those of you who are Elliott Wave people or read Robert Prechter, you'll see that right now we have a movement that is heading toward about $1,350.
[00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:53.322]  And when we get close to that number, then we'll see it back off and we'll have a bit of a correction.
[00:55:53.342 --> 00:55:56.843]  But that bottom correction side is going to be close to $12.80.
[00:55:57.323 --> 00:56:03.425]  And $12.80 is going to be very similar to what we've seen when gold was trading between $1,150 to $1,180.
[00:56:03.945 --> 00:56:05.926]  Things are going to start picking up.
[00:56:05.986 --> 00:56:13.568]  And then I expect that we'll have an acceleration coming right into September, October, November, like we typically do in gold.
[00:56:13.968 --> 00:56:19.271]  Even CNBC says $2,500 an ounce gold in the next year.
[00:56:19.411 --> 00:56:21.853]  But, I mean, regardless, gold and silver is real.
[00:56:22.273 --> 00:56:27.276]  Paper dollars and fiat derivatives are not real.
[00:56:27.696 --> 00:56:29.417]  Folks, get involved in gold and silver today.
[00:56:29.437 --> 00:56:29.477]  800-686-2237.
[00:56:29.497 --> 00:56:29.537]  800-686-2237.
[00:56:29.597 --> 00:56:30.598]  Thank you, Ted Anderson.
[00:56:30.618 --> 00:56:32.119]  Yeah, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[00:56:37.802 --> 00:56:38.122]  You bet.
[00:56:38.142 --> 00:56:42.124]  Again, that number if you missed it, 800-686-2237.
[00:56:42.524 --> 00:56:45.006]  Now, I've got some good news and some bad news.
[00:56:45.566 --> 00:56:50.968]  We were going to have Dr. John Coleman on earlier in the week, but he was ill.
[00:56:52.789 --> 00:56:55.631]  And he is ill again today, and he's apologized.
[00:56:56.531 --> 00:56:59.833]  But there's a lot to talk about, so I'm going to get him on for one segment.
[00:57:01.056 --> 00:57:04.257]  Coming up in the second segment of the next hour, 8 after to 21 after.
[00:57:04.798 --> 00:57:10.940]  He'll be on with us for one segment and the next week he'll be on health providing for a full hour with us.
[00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:14.121]  But the good news is that'll give us more time to take your calls.
[00:57:14.441 --> 00:57:15.562]  I'm gonna go to break here in a moment.
[00:57:15.582 --> 00:57:20.924]  We're gonna come back with Sam, Ronnie, Mike, Anthony, Danny and a lot of others that are holding.
[00:57:21.504 --> 00:57:22.684]  But I was really looking forward to
[00:57:25.307 --> 00:57:31.628]  Talking to Dr. John Coleman, of course he was also MI6, about drug war against America, how the British and U.S.
[00:57:31.648 --> 00:57:32.908]  government are shipping in drugs.
[00:57:32.928 --> 00:57:35.969]  Of course he wrote this years ago, it's now completely in the open.
[00:57:36.809 --> 00:57:39.190]  Of course he worked with MI6, he can tell you all about it.
[00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:43.170]  And Dr. John Coleman is also a constitutional lawyer.
[00:57:43.890 --> 00:57:51.832]  What you should know about the United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights, just an amazing book he wrote on that front, but we should carry his books, we don't carry them.
[00:57:53.413 --> 00:57:59.118]  Of course, the Conspiracy, Conspirators Hierarchy, the Committee of 300, Dr. John Coleman.
[00:57:59.158 --> 00:58:04.742]  I mean, he really, the more research I do, I realize what an amazing trailblazer he is.
[00:58:05.383 --> 00:58:09.787]  So, I hope he's well enough to be with us for a full hour next week.
[00:58:09.827 --> 00:58:13.170]  Again, that's why I hadn't had him on in years, because of health issues.
[00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:20.135]  Of course, he wrote the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations, Shaping Moral, Spiritual, Cultural, Political, and Economic Decline in the United States of America.
[00:58:21.357 --> 00:58:22.437]  I want to get him on about that.
[00:58:23.538 --> 00:58:25.320]  We're just out of time for this hour.
[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:29.143]  I'm going to come back, take your calls in this short next segment.
[00:58:30.224 --> 00:58:34.788]  And then we got Dr. Coleman on for one segment, then calls for the balance and a bunch of news.
[00:58:35.249 --> 00:58:39.512]  Illegal aliens rioted with Mexican flags and burned things and overturned cars in L.A.
[00:58:39.572 --> 00:58:40.013]  last night.
[00:58:41.997 --> 00:58:46.120]  Bringing you the best in alternative talk radio for over 10 years.
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:47.401]  GCN.
[00:58:48.001 --> 00:58:50.062]  Great Talk Radio starts here.
[00:58:50.743 --> 00:58:53.044]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:58:53.124 --> 00:58:55.326]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:58:55.446 --> 00:58:58.168]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:58:58.648 --> 00:59:03.411]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:59:03.751 --> 00:59:07.954]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:59:08.254 --> 00:59:10.578]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:59:10.598 --> 00:59:13.122]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:59:13.142 --> 00:59:16.066]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:59:16.406 --> 00:59:24.018]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:59:24.338 --> 00:59:29.600]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:32.521]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:59:32.581 --> 00:59:36.002]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:59:36.262 --> 00:59:37.183]  And I got news for you.
[00:59:37.323 --> 00:59:38.643]  You're everyone else.
[00:59:38.683 --> 00:59:39.684]  Invisible Empire.

[00:59:56.110 --> 00:59:59.050]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:07.613 --> 01:00:11.794]  Okay, let's go back to your phone calls, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:13.775 --> 01:00:17.155]  Let's go ahead and talk to Sam in California.
[01:00:18.936 --> 01:00:19.616]  Welcome, Sam.
[01:00:21.117 --> 01:00:21.557]  Hi, Alex.
[01:00:22.017 --> 01:00:22.377]  Yes, sir.
[01:00:23.795 --> 01:00:25.456]  All right, so good to talk to you.
[01:00:26.157 --> 01:00:30.501]  Yes, I have an opinion on what's going on in the Gulf.
[01:00:31.041 --> 01:00:36.706]  What I really wanted to talk about was a new weapon in the Info Wars, which I've created.
[01:00:39.949 --> 01:00:41.010]  So which one should I talk about?
[01:00:42.071 --> 01:00:42.951]  Whatever you wish, sir.
[01:00:44.232 --> 01:00:44.453]  All right.
[01:00:45.353 --> 01:00:51.899]  I am doing a local cable public access television show here in San Rafael, California.
[01:00:52.679 --> 01:00:54.780]  I'm calling it Conspiracy TV.
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:59.063]  The first episode premieres tomorrow.
[01:00:59.083 --> 01:01:04.067]  I've been given permission to broadcast The Panama Deception, which I'm sure you're familiar with.
[01:01:12.574 --> 01:01:15.236]  The government was dealing narcotics with Noriega on record.
[01:01:15.276 --> 01:01:19.940]  He threatened to blackmail Bush and there was an overnight invasion, claiming that two women had been kidnapped.
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:21.701]  Then it turned out it was totally fake.
[01:01:21.741 --> 01:01:22.542]  No one kidnapped them.
[01:01:22.902 --> 01:01:24.283]  That's the good old USA.
[01:01:25.344 --> 01:01:25.684]  Oh yeah.
[01:01:25.984 --> 01:01:29.487]  They went in and just killed civilians like they were in the way.
[01:01:30.529 --> 01:01:37.352]  Yeah, they used Puff the Magic Dragon C-130 with Gatling guns and howitzers blowing up Panama City.
[01:01:37.432 --> 01:01:38.052]  Hoorah!
[01:01:38.673 --> 01:01:42.254]  But meanwhile, the bankers are going to financially blow up your wallet, America!
[01:01:42.454 --> 01:01:46.816]  You're just as expendable as those people down there in Central America!
[01:01:46.836 --> 01:01:48.677]  Right, right.
[01:01:49.257 --> 01:01:55.340]  And the reason I'm calling is because I would like to share with other people my idea about this show, I think.
[01:01:55.871 --> 01:01:58.032]  It's something that people could do all over the country.
[01:01:58.312 --> 01:02:08.675]  Everybody can start a show and air clips of other people's documentaries and then analyze it, talk about it, take calls, do a different issue, show a different film every week.
[01:02:08.956 --> 01:02:12.057]  That's what I've been doing for 16 years, almost 16 years.
[01:02:12.077 --> 01:02:13.877]  I mean, is that your idea?
[01:02:15.078 --> 01:02:15.338]  Yes.
[01:02:15.458 --> 01:02:15.658]  Yeah.
[01:02:15.718 --> 01:02:19.899]  Well, yeah, it's a two hour show every Saturday night at 10 p.m.
[01:02:19.959 --> 01:02:21.760]  on my local cable public access channel.
[01:02:22.333 --> 01:02:24.354]  If you don't mind, I'd like to give the station a number.
[01:02:24.374 --> 01:02:24.855]  No, that's fine.
[01:02:24.895 --> 01:02:28.377]  You can put flyers out around your town and anybody else can do this.
[01:02:28.417 --> 01:02:28.997]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:02:29.017 --> 01:02:33.941]  Right, it's channel 26 on Comcast cable here in Marin.
[01:02:34.221 --> 01:02:43.807]  But the key is, the key is to go around to all the coffee shops and on telephone poles and put up the time and showing and when it's going to happen.
[01:02:43.827 --> 01:02:44.808]  I appreciate your call.
[01:02:44.888 --> 01:02:45.528]  Good job.
[01:02:46.008 --> 01:02:47.730]  To hear from you, Sam, keep it up.
[01:02:48.896 --> 01:02:52.919]  What they really need to see is the Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic, Don't Tread on Me, and films like that.
[01:02:53.859 --> 01:02:57.801]  But I'm sure they'll be informed by the Panama Deception.
[01:02:59.042 --> 01:03:01.083]  That's just kind of ancient history, but it's still important.
[01:03:01.643 --> 01:03:03.384]  Let's talk to Ronnie in Texas.
[01:03:03.885 --> 01:03:04.725]  Ronnie, go ahead.
[01:03:05.466 --> 01:03:07.147]  Thank you, sir.
[01:03:07.687 --> 01:03:14.631]  From fluoridated, illegal alien friendly, overrated, overfluoridated Austin, Texas.
[01:03:15.538 --> 01:03:25.744]  It's the, I've got a, the exaggerated oil slick is just the latest Monica Lewinsky level of distraction, in my mind, of this tyrannical meltdown of our sacred constitution.
[01:03:25.764 --> 01:03:35.470]  But instead, instead Monica, instead Clinton bombed an aspirin factory in Nigeria to distract from Monica Lewinsky.
[01:03:35.730 --> 01:03:41.594]  The oil spill is the distraction from the war on Iran that they're lining up right now and they don't want us kids talking about.
[01:03:42.458 --> 01:03:48.002]  You're exactly right, and it's the total destruction through crises of our sacred constitution.
[01:03:49.523 --> 01:03:51.665]  Let me ask you a question, Ronnie.
[01:03:51.705 --> 01:03:55.207]  How much weed, how much devil marijuana have you smoked today?
[01:03:57.108 --> 01:04:00.731]  Oh, I try to stay medicated at all times.
[01:04:00.791 --> 01:04:02.412]  Ronnie, I appreciate your call.
[01:04:02.452 --> 01:04:05.274]  Well, you got the government medicating you to the water and the chemtrails, why not?
[01:04:05.614 --> 01:04:07.296]  Mike in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:04:08.266 --> 01:04:08.766]  Hello, Alex.
[01:04:09.206 --> 01:04:09.566]  Hey, Bob.
[01:04:09.627 --> 01:04:18.690]  I just called to make you aware of something that I've seen on YouTube in Green Coast Springs, Florida, where they have thousands of U.N.
[01:04:18.770 --> 01:04:23.091]  vehicles lining up at an Air Force base there.
[01:04:23.291 --> 01:04:25.192]  I wanted to know if you heard anything about it.
[01:04:25.212 --> 01:04:35.095]  Well, we are getting confirmed reports of foreign troops massing all over the U.S., and I sent my guys to a drill, and they had Polish and Czech troops and others running around, trying to take on the U.S.
[01:04:35.395 --> 01:04:36.676]  What's the name of the video?
[01:04:38.072 --> 01:04:42.635]  I have the link and I have emailed it to you through your contact.
[01:04:43.175 --> 01:04:46.077]  I'm going to put you on hold and you can get the specific name of the video.
[01:04:46.538 --> 01:04:50.660]  We're going to do one segment with Dr. John Coleman because he isn't feeling well today.
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:58.285]  He'll be back with us a full hour next week, God willing, and that'll give us time in three other segments to take your phone calls and cover the news.
[01:04:58.606 --> 01:04:59.066]  Stay with us.
[01:05:01.291 --> 01:05:03.892]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:05:04.312 --> 01:05:09.273]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:05:09.633 --> 01:05:11.374]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:05:11.674 --> 01:05:16.495]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:05:16.675 --> 01:05:17.636]  How much do you want?
[01:05:17.856 --> 01:05:18.596]  When do you want it?
[01:05:18.976 --> 01:05:20.577]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:05:20.877 --> 01:05:21.697]  When will you need it?
[01:05:21.937 --> 01:05:23.998]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:05:24.158 --> 01:05:25.138]  Will there be any food?
[01:05:25.478 --> 01:05:29.400]  Will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself?
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:32.061]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:05:32.281 --> 01:05:35.443]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:05:35.863 --> 01:05:39.364]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:05:39.685 --> 01:05:40.665]  How much will you need?
[01:05:40.905 --> 01:05:41.505]  We don't know.
[01:05:41.806 --> 01:05:42.726]  How much do you want?
[01:05:42.906 --> 01:05:43.626]  All you can get.
[01:05:43.646 --> 01:05:44.647]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:05:44.927 --> 01:05:47.690]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:05:47.970 --> 01:05:51.094]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:05:51.114 --> 01:05:51.874]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:06:00.376 --> 01:06:05.219]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:06:05.339 --> 01:06:06.100]  What have we got?
[01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:08.461]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:06:08.781 --> 01:06:09.502]  A republic.
[01:06:09.782 --> 01:06:12.363]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:06:12.444 --> 01:06:14.345]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:06:14.705 --> 01:06:16.606]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:06:16.726 --> 01:06:18.007]  So they think they own our land?
[01:06:18.407 --> 01:06:19.528]  They think they own our water?
[01:06:19.728 --> 01:06:20.128]  Children?
[01:06:20.328 --> 01:06:21.109]  Our education?
[01:06:21.449 --> 01:06:22.069]  Our money?
[01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:25.932]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:06:26.292 --> 01:06:29.937]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:06:30.097 --> 01:06:30.959]  You'll be warned.
[01:06:31.279 --> 01:06:32.100]  We have the facts.
[01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:33.402]  We have the Constitution.
[01:06:33.462 --> 01:06:34.343]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:06:34.363 --> 01:06:35.204]  We have common law.
[01:06:35.264 --> 01:06:37.507]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:37.768 --> 01:06:41.553]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:06:41.653 --> 01:06:46.438]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:06:46.598 --> 01:06:47.979]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:06:48.099 --> 01:06:48.940]  Don't tread on me.
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:56.067]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:07.102]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[01:07:07.822 --> 01:07:12.263]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.
[01:07:13.104 --> 01:07:26.628]  Featuring Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Joseph Farah, David Icke, Naomi Wolf, G. Edward Griffin, Doug McIntyre, Mark Crispin Miller, Mickey Z, Doug Casey, David McElhaney, and myself, Alex Jones.
[01:07:27.408 --> 01:07:31.852]  Protect yourself and get the tools you need to protect your family from these difficult times.

[01:07:46.364 --> 01:07:46.844]  Or call 800-655-1577.
[01:07:46.864 --> 01:07:49.106]  Prepare yourself and the ones you love today.
[01:07:49.146 --> 01:07:50.027]  fallofamerica.net.
[01:08:03.507 --> 01:08:08.853]  From the Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:09.474 --> 01:08:12.437]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:15.495 --> 01:08:21.277]  Well, he's only with us for one segment because he's under the weather, and I'm going to nail down a full hour with him next week.
[01:08:21.797 --> 01:08:29.779]  Dr. John Pullman, author of Drug War Against America, What You Should Know About the United States, Constitutional Rights, a separate book.
[01:08:29.799 --> 01:08:35.541]  Of course, he's best known for The Conspirators' Hierarchy, the Committee of 300, now in its fourth edition.
[01:08:36.261 --> 01:08:42.043]  Doctor of Constitutional Law, reportedly worked with, well, you know what?
[01:08:42.723 --> 01:08:44.866]  Doc, it's always good to have you because you've done so much.
[01:08:45.327 --> 01:08:50.514]  How would you describe yourself best in your bio in this short segment we've got you with us for?
[01:08:51.475 --> 01:08:52.797]  How would I describe myself?
[01:08:53.257 --> 01:08:53.518]  Yes.
[01:08:53.578 --> 01:08:58.144]  Just a very ordinary fellow trying to get information out to the people who need it very badly.
[01:08:59.281 --> 01:09:00.822]  Well, you've put out invaluable info.
[01:09:00.842 --> 01:09:05.423]  We don't have a lot of time with you today because I don't want to twist your arm into a full hour with you being under the weather.
[01:09:06.084 --> 01:09:07.324]  But so much is happening.
[01:09:07.364 --> 01:09:09.425]  I wanted to get you back on about the globalist hierarchy.
[01:09:10.125 --> 01:09:14.307]  But the limited time we have today, they're openly saying they want to attack Iran.
[01:09:14.347 --> 01:09:18.469]  They want to board their ships with a blockade, which is an act of war.
[01:09:19.029 --> 01:09:20.790]  Looks like that's going to the front burner.
[01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:23.951]  I see this oil spill as a diversion
[01:09:24.671 --> 01:09:31.414]  While they get their internet censorship bills passed, their carbon tax passed, what's your take on the oil spill?
[01:09:32.094 --> 01:09:35.536]  I think that it's a contrite situation, myself.
[01:09:36.396 --> 01:09:39.618]  I've not voiced that opinion before, but I believe that is the case.
[01:09:40.678 --> 01:09:45.320]  In other words, it's something akin to Pearl Harbor, which was a contrite situation, you know?
[01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:53.304]  Roosevelt told Stimson and Noxon, he said, we've somehow got to get the Japanese into a position where they will fire the first shots.
[01:09:54.190 --> 01:09:57.635]  I think what this is all about, it's about the same kind of thing.
[01:09:59.005 --> 01:10:02.346]  Absolutely, and what brought you to that conclusion?
[01:10:02.386 --> 01:10:03.966]  Because that's the only conclusion I have.
[01:10:04.026 --> 01:10:11.269]  Day one, my gut told me that, but now we know they ordered the people on the rig to dump seawater in instead of cement for a month.
[01:10:11.349 --> 01:10:14.229]  The rig operator said this will explode, so they gave orders.
[01:10:14.269 --> 01:10:15.070]  They knew it would lead to it.
[01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:18.711]  Turns out Goldman Sachs really owned much of BP.
[01:10:18.871 --> 01:10:21.391]  Its chairman was also the chairman of BP.
[01:10:21.432 --> 01:10:24.532]  Goldman Sachs dumped 44% of its stock the week before.
[01:10:24.552 --> 01:10:25.553]  The BP
[01:10:26.833 --> 01:10:28.233]  I don't think that's the answer at all.
[01:10:28.253 --> 01:10:29.454]  I think that what they've got to do is put
[01:10:57.054 --> 01:11:00.576]  Six or seven hundred boats out there to clean the mess up as quickly as they can.
[01:11:00.796 --> 01:11:02.097]  That's what the solution is.
[01:11:02.457 --> 01:11:10.642]  Absolutely, but Doctor, in the time we have, because I'm ranting here, I mean, what brought you to the conclusion that it's a contrived staged event?
[01:11:11.582 --> 01:11:14.524]  I've seen so many of these things in the past, in history itself.
[01:11:15.124 --> 01:11:24.490]  Like, to go back to, you know, to the Second World War, they got this supposedly insane Dutchman to fire some shots
[01:11:25.129 --> 01:11:30.791]  And they said, Oh, this is a, this was something done by one of the nations and the cause for war.
[01:11:31.571 --> 01:11:35.973]  So it's, there's so many things in history that have been similar to this.
[01:11:37.354 --> 01:11:53.460]  And Pearl Harbor sending the Japanese cutting off their supplies of raw materials that vital for their production and their continued wellbeing, a unilateral action by Roosevelt, not even consulting the Japanese.
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:54.160]  And then of course,
[01:11:54.901 --> 01:12:02.625]  You know, when the Japanese came to see him in Washington, Marshall was out riding in Central Park and they couldn't get to anybody.
[01:12:03.405 --> 01:12:06.367]  Of course, I have no grief for the Japanese attacking Pearl Harbor.
[01:12:06.447 --> 01:12:07.347]  It's inexcusable.
[01:12:07.827 --> 01:12:10.209]  But nevertheless, this is the kind of thing that happens.
[01:12:10.909 --> 01:12:15.671]  These contrite situations are made from time to time when it suits the purpose.
[01:12:16.532 --> 01:12:22.675]  And we all know that the Committee of 300 are the people pulling the strings, mainly, from every situation, from every angle.
[01:12:24.127 --> 01:12:39.720]  That's right, and if they have to sacrifice the name of BP, formerly Anglo-American Oil, they'll just change the name again, and BP has always been at the heart of pushing the global carbon tax to fund the world government, and then now notice it was a BP rig that this happened with.
[01:12:40.541 --> 01:12:44.604]  I don't know if you remember what happened in the time
[01:12:45.276 --> 01:12:45.776]  That's right.
[01:12:45.956 --> 01:12:46.276]  That's right.
[01:13:05.951 --> 01:13:06.731]  Absolutely.
[01:13:06.811 --> 01:13:11.993]  That's what DynCorp did after they got caught involved in sex slave trafficking.
[01:13:12.634 --> 01:13:20.337]  Well, Doc, in the limited time we have here, and again we're going to nail you down for next week, so much is happening in the world.
[01:13:20.457 --> 01:13:23.838]  What's your concern dealing with Iran?
[01:13:24.418 --> 01:13:28.240]  Do you see frightening movements towards war with Iran?
[01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:33.562]  I see that, in my opinion, for what it's worth, war in the Middle East is
[01:13:34.444 --> 01:13:35.825]  It's almost imminent.
[01:13:37.226 --> 01:13:38.507]  I see this is where it's heading.
[01:13:39.268 --> 01:13:40.449]  All factors point to it.
[01:13:42.991 --> 01:13:44.192]  Wow, absolutely.
[01:13:44.472 --> 01:13:47.915]  We're on the same page on that front, unfortunately.
[01:13:47.935 --> 01:13:51.158]  You see how they're driving Iran into a corner?
[01:13:51.718 --> 01:13:53.199]  They're doing everything they can to.
[01:13:53.219 --> 01:13:59.725]  And Russia has disgraced itself by reneging on their contract, which they've had since 2003, to supply the S-300 anti-aircraft
[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:05.921]  Aircraft missile system.
[01:14:06.482 --> 01:14:07.482]  It's probably the best.
[01:14:07.582 --> 01:14:18.912]  It is not probably, but certainly the best in the world that could shoot down aircraft from 75 miles away and not miss because each one, each missile has its own guided system, which cannot be jammed.
[01:14:19.272 --> 01:14:21.273]  Once fired, it's bound to hit its target.
[01:14:22.434 --> 01:14:26.478]  And so they stopped supplying that to make the way easy for them to attack Iran.
[01:14:27.418 --> 01:14:32.923]  That's next on the cards, which I think will lead to a major conflagration in the Middle East.
[01:14:34.048 --> 01:14:37.549]  I think that Putin has completely disgraced himself and Russia in this move.
[01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:40.110]  So, Lord knows what they're up to.
[01:14:41.931 --> 01:14:51.295]  Russia had been claiming that they were going to not go along with an attack on Iran, but they are now, it looks like, starting to renege on that.
[01:14:51.695 --> 01:14:53.276]  Also, as you mentioned, Venezuela.
[01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:55.897]  What pressure do you think was brought to bear on Russia?
[01:14:58.231 --> 01:14:59.932]  By the United States?
[01:15:00.232 --> 01:15:00.493]  Yes.
[01:15:00.993 --> 01:15:01.713]  Oh, a great deal.
[01:15:01.753 --> 01:15:13.581]  They sent several androids over there to talk with Medvedev, who, by the way, is not exactly the brightest of people, but Putin had to step down because of his constitution.
[01:15:14.381 --> 01:15:19.064]  And Medvedev, of course, does whatever Putin tells him in the background.
[01:15:19.145 --> 01:15:25.809]  So I think they went to put a lot of pressure on Russia, a tremendous amount of pressure on Russia, to join in the game.
[01:15:27.205 --> 01:15:35.029]  China's gone along very, very reluctantly, but of course, and I think that they'll find Iran a very, very hard nut to crack.
[01:15:35.490 --> 01:15:38.651]  They have their militia called the Fasdarans, about a million men.
[01:15:39.452 --> 01:15:40.232]  Very well trained.
[01:15:40.272 --> 01:15:42.754]  They have their regular army, which is an enormous size.
[01:15:43.254 --> 01:15:47.016]  And you know, Iran itself was ten times the size of Iraq.
[01:15:47.668 --> 01:15:55.100]  Since we found such a terrible job on our hands trying to subdue Iraq, I don't know if we're going to do the same thing to Iran.
[01:15:55.161 --> 01:15:56.943]  I think it's a physical impossibility.
[01:15:57.304 --> 01:15:58.927]  I think it's beyond the capabilities.
[01:15:59.813 --> 01:16:02.634]  Call the United States military powers as it stands now.
[01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:25.941]  But as we get towards the end and the formation of world government, clearly they want to pin all their crimes on us.
[01:16:26.382 --> 01:16:32.483]  Why do they want to destroy the goose that laid their golden eggs of tyranny and empire?
[01:16:32.983 --> 01:16:36.444]  And where do you see all of this basically winding up?
[01:16:36.504 --> 01:16:38.404]  What's their endgame strategy?
[01:16:39.104 --> 01:16:46.146]  The endgame, as I said before, the endgame is to usher in a new world order inside a one world government, which will be the Committee of 300.
[01:16:47.438 --> 01:17:03.245]  And the way to do this is, first of all, destroy the most powerful nation in the world, the United States of America, which is a temporary expedient, and they feel that they can, once this is up and running, they can revive the patient by applying all the necessary techniques.
[01:17:03.325 --> 01:17:10.768]  It's like a person who gets knocked temporarily unconscious, you know, kill oxygen and all kinds of stuff, and in a very short while they recover.
[01:17:11.388 --> 01:17:16.350]  So they've got such faith in the United States, and rightly so, it's a tremendous economic
[01:17:17.250 --> 01:17:18.932]  I've made about 500 predictions in my lifetime.
[01:17:46.653 --> 01:17:48.274]  Almost all of them have come to pass.
[01:17:50.235 --> 01:17:55.179]  No, I know you have on record, but I mean, what is their final plan then for the United States?
[01:17:55.759 --> 01:18:05.966]  Final plan will be the United States will be the premium, the number one country inside, their showcase country inside the new world order, one world government.
[01:18:07.827 --> 01:18:08.587]  That's their plan.
[01:18:10.108 --> 01:18:12.330]  They can't dispense with the United States altogether.
[01:18:13.270 --> 01:18:15.412]  It's too important an organization
[01:18:15.854 --> 01:18:17.296]  From an economic point alone.
[01:18:18.097 --> 01:18:20.019]  So it has to remain viable.
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:27.929]  And of course, once this organization is in place, and it's not a new thing, you know, they've been trying this since the days of King George III.
[01:18:28.630 --> 01:18:34.297]  At that time, he was lining up all the European powers to join in the scheme he had, which he also called a New World Order.
[01:18:36.171 --> 01:18:45.554]  Well, sure, but the Republic as we know, the free market, private property system that we've known, that is to be dismantled.
[01:18:46.354 --> 01:18:47.234]  Oh yes, that'll go.
[01:18:47.914 --> 01:18:48.955]  That definitely will go.
[01:18:48.975 --> 01:18:58.697]  Yes, everything will become, it will become like the social, you know, it's actually, the clear goal is to socialize the United States.
[01:18:58.717 --> 01:19:01.538]  You can see it in every move that the President is making.
[01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:05.533]  Oh, every step he's taking, I mean, is towards socialism in America.
[01:19:05.553 --> 01:19:07.315]  America will be socialized.
[01:19:07.375 --> 01:19:08.956]  I don't think there's a slightest doubt in that.
[01:19:09.456 --> 01:19:12.219]  Roosevelt strove mightily to bring that about.
[01:19:12.319 --> 01:19:13.420]  It didn't quite succeed.
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:16.502]  But he built a very good bridge towards socialism.
[01:19:17.143 --> 01:19:20.386]  And I think that Obama's continuing to build that bridge.
[01:19:20.765 --> 01:19:33.232]  And of course that's because they want everyone dependent on the system and so everyone's so poor they would never have their own means to organize any type of even political resistance to the social engineers so they can have their way with us.
[01:19:33.952 --> 01:19:36.593]  Doctor, we'll talk to you again next week.
[01:19:36.633 --> 01:19:44.778]  Let me say bye to you during this break and try to nail down a time later on next week when you feel a bit better so we can do a full hour on this because I want to talk about your book.
[01:19:45.498 --> 01:19:53.624]  Dealing with the Tavistock Institute, one of the premier organizations really fashioning the modern mind control that we're under.
[01:19:54.245 --> 01:19:58.708]  Your phone calls are straight ahead and we'll talk about the riots after the Lakers game yesterday.
[01:19:58.728 --> 01:19:59.509]  Stay with us.
[01:20:01.843 --> 01:20:04.447]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:20:04.867 --> 01:20:09.835]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:20:10.195 --> 01:20:11.938]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:20:12.238 --> 01:20:17.005]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:20:17.225 --> 01:20:18.206]  How much do you want?
[01:20:18.406 --> 01:20:19.167]  When do you want it?
[01:20:19.548 --> 01:20:21.149]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:20:21.429 --> 01:20:22.250]  When will you need it?
[01:20:22.491 --> 01:20:24.553]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:20:24.713 --> 01:20:25.794]  Will there be any food?
[01:20:26.034 --> 01:20:27.375]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:20:27.576 --> 01:20:32.641]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:20:32.861 --> 01:20:34.923]  You wipe out all these problems if you have
[01:20:36.715 --> 01:20:36.935]  We're good.
[01:21:01.383 --> 01:21:06.244]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:21:06.364 --> 01:21:07.145]  What have we got?
[01:21:07.365 --> 01:21:09.485]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:21:09.805 --> 01:21:10.546]  A republic.
[01:21:10.806 --> 01:21:13.386]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:21:13.446 --> 01:21:15.367]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:21:15.707 --> 01:21:17.627]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:21:17.747 --> 01:21:19.008]  So they think they own our land?
[01:21:19.428 --> 01:21:20.548]  They think they own our water?
[01:21:20.748 --> 01:21:21.148]  Children?
[01:21:21.348 --> 01:21:22.129]  Our education?
[01:21:22.469 --> 01:21:23.129]  Our money?
[01:21:23.289 --> 01:21:26.930]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:21:27.310 --> 01:21:31.995]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:21:32.295 --> 01:21:33.116]  We have the facts.
[01:21:33.316 --> 01:21:34.437]  We have the Constitution.
[01:21:34.477 --> 01:21:35.358]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:21:35.378 --> 01:21:36.219]  We have common law.
[01:21:36.279 --> 01:21:38.521]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:21:38.801 --> 01:21:42.605]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:21:42.685 --> 01:21:47.489]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:21:47.649 --> 01:21:48.991]  A new tool in the InfoWars.
[01:21:49.151 --> 01:21:49.992]  Don't Tread on Me.
[01:21:50.232 --> 01:21:51.473]  Order it at InfoWars.com.
[01:21:52.774 --> 01:22:00.717]  Or prisonplanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:22:01.457 --> 01:22:04.178]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[01:22:04.418 --> 01:22:08.380]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:10.641]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:22:10.821 --> 01:22:15.843]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[01:22:16.003 --> 01:22:17.743]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[01:22:17.823 --> 01:22:19.124]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[01:22:19.344 --> 01:22:20.805]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[01:22:20.845 --> 01:22:23.927]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[01:22:24.207 --> 01:22:29.250]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:38.675]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled Ten Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[01:22:38.695 --> 01:22:39.095]  I think so.
[01:23:01.098 --> 01:23:04.620]  I'm concerned about food for my family in the event of an emergency.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.421]  And I know you are too.
[01:23:06.941 --> 01:23:07.542]  Are you ready?
[01:23:07.982 --> 01:23:09.743]  Don't wait for an emergency to happen.
[01:23:09.943 --> 01:23:14.286]  Put a plan together now with quality dehydrated food from Ready Reserve Foods.
[01:23:14.546 --> 01:23:20.009]  For nearly 40 years, Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, canning the finest in dehydration.
[01:23:20.029 --> 01:23:21.089]  We're good to go.
[01:23:48.660 --> 01:23:49.781]  Call 1-800-453-2202 or visit readyreservefoods.com.
[01:23:49.801 --> 01:23:50.141]  Call 1-800-453-2202.
[01:23:50.162 --> 01:23:50.902]  Ready Reserve Foods.
[01:23:50.982 --> 01:23:51.643]  Factory Direct.
[01:23:51.683 --> 01:23:52.143]  Wholesale Pricing.
[01:24:06.949 --> 01:24:09.791]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am in complete information overload.
[01:24:09.831 --> 01:24:21.157]  We do cover 50, 60 stories generally a day here on this four hour radio broadcast, but there's a story up on InfoWars.com and I just watched the video earlier and I just can't believe it.
[01:24:22.130 --> 01:24:31.916]  Federal agents harass and intimidate congressional candidate Charles Black, and he announced he was having a congressional campaign meeting at a gun range.
[01:24:32.876 --> 01:24:38.999]  And the federal officers drove three and a half hours to harass and intimidate congressional candidate Charles Black, running for U.S.
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.760]  House of Representatives for Arizona District 2.
[01:24:41.821 --> 01:24:52.586]  Agents then demand the people at the gun range unload their firearms and put them down and basically say they can't have a political meeting with guns and then demand that a ten-year-old girl stop videotaping them.
[01:24:52.926 --> 01:24:59.309]  This is exactly the type of corrupt government Mr. Black is out to shut down for the protection of the US citizens.
[01:24:59.409 --> 01:25:02.090]  We have constitutional rights and no man is above the law.
[01:25:02.570 --> 01:25:05.392]  And I saw a video last week we posted on Infowars.com.
[01:25:05.452 --> 01:25:10.314]  A woman went out and had a pro-Palestinian rally of peaceful Americans
[01:25:11.767 --> 01:25:15.851]  against what happened with the flotilla, whether you're for that or against it, it's her right.
[01:25:16.352 --> 01:25:22.498]  And two FBI agents come to her door and ask her if she's basically a terrorist and if she's planning violence.
[01:25:23.759 --> 01:25:26.862]  And she says, well, you know, I'm not planning anything, but why are you here?
[01:25:26.942 --> 01:25:30.145]  And it's because she had that public meeting.
[01:25:30.746 --> 01:25:31.987]  They want you to shut up.
[01:25:32.087 --> 01:25:33.369]  They want you to be intimidated.
[01:25:35.478 --> 01:25:38.380]  And I'm watching this video, it's up on Infowars.com.
[01:25:39.060 --> 01:25:40.481]  It's just how crazy they are!
[01:25:40.521 --> 01:25:41.701]  They're so crazy!
[01:25:44.743 --> 01:25:50.206]  I had FBI last year, about a week before Obama Deception came out, calling.
[01:25:50.806 --> 01:25:52.687]  And I called the number, and it was the FBI.
[01:25:52.708 --> 01:26:01.732]  They were calling my employees here, asking them about Alex Jones, asking about what I think of Obama, about the film.
[01:26:02.473 --> 01:26:04.134]  And so I had to release the film early.
[01:26:05.151 --> 01:26:07.512]  Because they were getting ready to come in here and try to shut it down.
[01:26:07.592 --> 01:26:11.013]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, I mean, this is secret police!
[01:26:11.593 --> 01:26:26.397]  And I've got a whole bunch of mainstream news articles today, CNS News, AP, you name it, where they're going, yeah, Obama can shut the internet down, and he may start shutting it down, and they may restrict free speech, and they may restrict political statements, because it's what we need now.
[01:26:26.798 --> 01:26:31.159]  I mean, they're just kind of coming out real calm and saying, yeah, we're going to take your freedom.
[01:26:34.384 --> 01:26:37.029]  Anthony in New York, then Danny Nelson, John Jim.
[01:26:37.129 --> 01:26:38.632]  Anthony, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:26:38.652 --> 01:26:41.197]  Hey Alex, this is Anthony Tolda.
[01:26:41.217 --> 01:26:46.206]  We spoke back in October after I made national news yelling at Steve Israel, the healthcare meeting.
[01:26:46.526 --> 01:26:47.328]  Yes, good job.
[01:26:48.584 --> 01:26:52.365]  Yeah, and Jason was kind enough to have me on his show on November 1st, too.
[01:26:52.846 --> 01:27:05.931]  Yeah, I mean, back then, 14, 15 months ago, the media was still saying you were all financed by lobbyists, and that whole crowds would say, we don't want government health care, and they would say, it's a hoax.
[01:27:06.411 --> 01:27:09.332]  But now national polls show over 80% against it.
[01:27:09.672 --> 01:27:11.613]  When it passed, it was over 75%.
[01:27:12.153 --> 01:27:13.574]  And they just say it's all a hoax.
[01:27:13.934 --> 01:27:14.794]  It doesn't exist.
[01:27:15.134 --> 01:27:16.415]  You must be a racist, Anthony.
[01:27:17.814 --> 01:27:34.185]  Oh, well, you're going to get me started on what I call the... Now there's a famous YouTube video, or viral YouTube video, of a woman screaming in my face, calling me a racist, in front of Atla Church in Harlem, at day one of the Obama-CIA-Columbia University trial.
[01:27:35.386 --> 01:27:42.871]  I'm a friend of and ally of Reverend Manning, as I know you are, and there's been pretty much a near-media blackout on this whole trial.
[01:27:44.551 --> 01:27:53.936]  Well, we had Reverend Manning on about it and covered the fact that he had a public trial to put this evidence out, but that's basically the skinny.
[01:27:54.796 --> 01:27:56.557]  But Obama is illegitimate.
[01:27:56.577 --> 01:27:57.538]  He is CIA.
[01:27:57.618 --> 01:27:58.998]  He is an Indonesian citizen.
[01:27:59.339 --> 01:28:00.059]  He is a traitor.
[01:28:00.099 --> 01:28:00.939]  He is a mobster.
[01:28:01.260 --> 01:28:11.845]  He does get his home and things in the past paid for by mobsters, just like BP paid for the million dollar condo for years of Rahm Emanuel.
[01:28:11.885 --> 01:28:13.466]  It's just a lawless group of thugs.
[01:28:15.202 --> 01:28:26.134]  Sure, and if you want to talk about people being shut up, and even shut up about this issue, Alex, a friend of mine got her radio show shut down, the station was shut down, and the website was shut down.
[01:28:26.950 --> 01:28:36.998]  90 minutes before her program was going to air and I was going to be a guest and we were going to discuss this trial and my attendance there and the viral video and all this stuff.
[01:28:37.078 --> 01:28:41.261]  You know, it takes a lot of time to do something like that, even if that happened, that might have been coincidental.
[01:28:41.341 --> 01:28:44.904]  I mean, stations are being bought and sold and changing hands constantly.
[01:28:45.444 --> 01:28:46.826]  I mean, I have seen censorship.
[01:28:46.866 --> 01:28:51.011]  I've been censored myself many years ago, but I found The Awakening is on.
[01:28:51.251 --> 01:28:54.334]  They're trying to intimidate us now by taking the gloves off.
[01:28:54.475 --> 01:28:55.536]  I think it's going to backfire.
[01:28:55.796 --> 01:28:58.159]  So the answer is just scream more bloody murder, Anthony.
[01:28:58.179 --> 01:28:59.641]  Well, sure, Alex.
[01:28:59.661 --> 01:29:00.442]  That's why I called you.
[01:29:00.482 --> 01:29:04.106]  And of course, we can't prove that it was shut down because of the topic, but
[01:29:04.928 --> 01:29:15.272]  She did tell me that in the past when she was going to be a guest on the same network, different program, she was contacted by his truth squads and they threatened to sue her.
[01:29:15.292 --> 01:29:19.813]  Oh no, that does go on and we've had that happen and you've got to ignore it and I appreciate your call.
[01:29:19.833 --> 01:29:20.774]  Good to hear from you, Anthony.
[01:29:20.794 --> 01:29:21.574]  Keep up the good work.
[01:29:21.994 --> 01:29:22.714]  We're going to break here.
[01:29:22.734 --> 01:29:23.855]  I'm going to come back with more calls.
[01:29:24.615 --> 01:29:25.295]  It's a catch-22.
[01:29:25.315 --> 01:29:28.156]  I could talk to each one of these callers for an hour but then I'll never get to the other calls.
[01:29:28.977 --> 01:29:31.077]  I have the newscast.
[01:29:31.117 --> 01:29:31.718]  In fact, it's in
[01:29:33.158 --> 01:29:41.283]  All the Republican-Obama deception, we have short clips of it, where they had police on the news in Missouri and other states going, look, you talk bad about Obama, we're gonna come arrest you.
[01:29:41.764 --> 01:29:44.405]  This is how thuggish and how crazy they are.
[01:29:44.425 --> 01:29:46.066]  This is what they think of America.
[01:29:46.326 --> 01:29:47.687]  This is what they think of your rights.
[01:29:47.968 --> 01:29:51.110]  You gotta stand up to these mobsters and say, I'm not intimidated.
[01:29:51.150 --> 01:29:52.010]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.510 --> 01:29:54.091]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.032 --> 01:29:57.714]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.529 --> 01:30:04.470]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:30:04.710 --> 01:30:10.751]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:30:11.111 --> 01:30:18.192]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:30:18.492 --> 01:30:23.073]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:30:23.373 --> 01:30:25.494]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:30:28.314 --> 01:30:31.837]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:30:32.077 --> 01:30:34.339]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:30:34.359 --> 01:30:34.680]  Call us!

[01:30:55.018 --> 01:30:55.459]  Thank you!
[01:31:02.128 --> 01:31:05.771]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:06.091 --> 01:31:14.237]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:31:14.958 --> 01:31:19.001]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:31:19.581 --> 01:31:30.410]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:31:31.030 --> 01:31:40.053]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:40.553 --> 01:31:45.615]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:31:45.975 --> 01:31:53.158]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:53.458 --> 01:31:56.219]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:31:59.994 --> 01:32:04.237]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:04.537 --> 01:32:04.817]  Number 1.
[01:32:05.458 --> 01:32:08.600]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:09.440]  Number 2.
[01:32:09.741 --> 01:32:14.284]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:14.624 --> 01:32:15.064]  It's true.
[01:32:15.364 --> 01:32:19.927]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.248 --> 01:32:20.788]  Number 3.
[01:32:21.068 --> 01:32:24.350]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:24.650 --> 01:32:28.353]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:28.553 --> 01:32:29.113]  Number four.
[01:32:29.353 --> 01:32:31.714]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:32.114 --> 01:32:35.496]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:35.796 --> 01:32:36.336]  Number five.
[01:32:36.576 --> 01:32:40.498]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:40.718 --> 01:32:45.500]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:45.780 --> 01:32:49.801]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:49.961 --> 01:32:51.522]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:51.742 --> 01:32:56.344]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:32:56.664 --> 01:32:56.704]  877-327-0365
[01:33:05.484 --> 01:33:08.966]  We've got 27 minutes left in live radio broadcast.
[01:33:08.986 --> 01:33:12.408]  I'll be back live this Sunday with the abbreviated Sunday Show, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:12.448 --> 01:33:13.969]  Central, that's 5 to 7 p.m.
[01:33:14.049 --> 01:33:14.389]  Eastern.
[01:33:15.330 --> 01:33:22.454]  I want to try to hurry through Danny, Nelson, John, Jim, and Eric's calls, at least those calls, perhaps even more at 1-800-259-9231, because I then...
[01:33:27.017 --> 01:33:30.399]  I want to go through all this news that I haven't yet covered yet.
[01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:35.522]  Look at this article out of the San Antonio Express News, hidden in plain view.
[01:33:37.123 --> 01:33:40.725]  Agents find 48 immigrants locked in tractor trailer.
[01:33:42.506 --> 01:33:45.928]  48 unauthorized immigrants were found locked in a tractor trailer.
[01:33:47.813 --> 01:33:48.473]  In Laredo.
[01:33:49.174 --> 01:33:50.134]  Unauthorized.
[01:33:50.174 --> 01:33:51.415]  It's not illegal alien.
[01:33:51.475 --> 01:33:52.495]  It's not illegal immigrant.
[01:33:52.975 --> 01:33:53.976]  It's unauthorized.
[01:33:53.996 --> 01:33:56.017]  See, this is the political correctness, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:56.337 --> 01:34:03.420]  You try to sneak into Mexico, they will put you in a forced labor camp for at least a year and extort money out of your family on record.
[01:34:05.281 --> 01:34:06.661]  But nobody talks bad about that.
[01:34:07.382 --> 01:34:11.123]  No, it's only America, because we're a bunch of schmucks, according to the elite.
[01:34:11.483 --> 01:34:14.885]  We're a bunch of people who can be guilted into going along with anything.
[01:34:16.772 --> 01:34:19.633]  And I wanted to dovetail that with Mexican flag.
[01:34:19.653 --> 01:34:21.614]  And we'll play some of this in the background while I talk about it.
[01:34:21.694 --> 01:34:24.935]  Mexican flag waving Lakers fans riot in L.A.
[01:34:24.955 --> 01:34:25.835]  This is out of the sun.
[01:34:25.855 --> 01:34:27.556]  And we have the video of this.
[01:34:28.276 --> 01:34:29.317]  Illegal aliens.
[01:34:31.678 --> 01:34:33.638]  Just incredible photos in the L.A.
[01:34:33.678 --> 01:34:34.078]  Times.
[01:34:34.098 --> 01:34:35.499]  It's even more powerful than the video.
[01:34:35.899 --> 01:34:40.801]  They go up to people's cars and turn cars over with people in them.
[01:34:42.950 --> 01:34:48.791]  By the way, with Hispanics in them, if you look at the photos, but they are waving Mexican flags as they turn cars over.
[01:34:49.471 --> 01:34:56.533]  So it's not even an anti-white thing, it's just a crazy pro-Mexico thing with big, giant Mexican flags waving.
[01:34:56.553 --> 01:34:58.594]  There's photos and videos all over the web in a minute.
[01:34:58.894 --> 01:35:02.894]  On this video you can see the Mexican flags, two giant ones being waved.
[01:35:03.755 --> 01:35:05.335]  And I mean, this is the insanity.
[01:35:05.735 --> 01:35:09.356]  Why don't these people go to Mexico and riot against their corrupt government?
[01:35:10.421 --> 01:35:13.585]  Well, because their government would machine gun them, as they do routinely.
[01:35:13.725 --> 01:35:14.807]  There's the Mexican flags.
[01:35:15.187 --> 01:35:15.608]  Why?
[01:35:16.128 --> 01:35:19.012]  Why wouldn't they get upset against the tyranny in their own country?
[01:35:19.032 --> 01:35:19.072]  No.
[01:35:20.796 --> 01:35:21.897]  The Lakers win.
[01:35:21.917 --> 01:35:23.458]  Did they win?
[01:35:23.518 --> 01:35:24.238]  I wasn't even paying attention.
[01:35:24.258 --> 01:35:25.179]  They said it was a celebration.
[01:35:25.199 --> 01:35:25.799]  I guess they won.
[01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:32.084]  And so let's riot all over the downtown area and let's turn cars over with people in them.
[01:35:32.484 --> 01:35:33.585]  Let's break out windows.
[01:35:33.625 --> 01:35:36.346]  Let's set fires to cabs.
[01:35:37.907 --> 01:35:42.851]  Let's do all of this for hours and have the police just stand down.
[01:35:43.191 --> 01:35:50.176]  Can you imagine if the Tea Party would have tumped over a newspaper stand or would have burnt a car or would have turned a car over?
[01:35:51.156 --> 01:35:52.457]  In fact, I didn't give you this, guys.
[01:35:52.477 --> 01:35:58.062]  I'm going to give you an LA Times article where they have a photo of the Hispanics in a car and then the car was turned over.
[01:35:59.062 --> 01:36:04.346]  You got a Hispanic family in a car and these crazy lunatics with Mexican flags run up and turn the car over.
[01:36:04.687 --> 01:36:05.187]  I mean, what?
[01:36:05.367 --> 01:36:07.929]  And they're all smiling and laughing like it's fun!
[01:36:08.569 --> 01:36:10.231]  This is mob psychology, folks.
[01:36:10.251 --> 01:36:11.772]  This is what happened in Nazi Germany.
[01:36:12.092 --> 01:36:14.134]  This is what happened in Soviet Russia with the Communists.
[01:36:14.554 --> 01:36:16.135]  They just get all like it's fun.
[01:36:16.215 --> 01:36:19.538]  They get all wound up because a stupid sports team won.
[01:36:22.090 --> 01:36:28.928]  But again, at a tribal level, all humans have this, when your team is mock gladiatorial warfare.
[01:36:30.140 --> 01:36:40.744]  And so it hits the same neurons, the same ganglia in the brain, that when you invest in your basketball, football, baseball, or favorite golfer, when they make that score, you feel like you had a victory.
[01:36:40.985 --> 01:36:49.448]  You're supposed to feel good in a war, because a tribe that was coming to kill all the males, take the women and children as slaves, that's what all cultures did.
[01:36:49.628 --> 01:36:52.449]  Africans, the Germanic tribes, they all did this.
[01:36:52.529 --> 01:36:53.690]  Didn't matter one area of the world.
[01:36:55.848 --> 01:36:59.512]  The war instinct is so you see your wife and kids again.
[01:36:59.552 --> 01:37:02.375]  It doesn't matter if you get your bones broken or your head clubbed in.
[01:37:02.596 --> 01:37:05.699]  You're happy to go out there and you're not afraid.
[01:37:05.719 --> 01:37:07.942]  You know, the enemy lands in their ships.
[01:37:08.302 --> 01:37:09.704]  It's 4,000 years ago.
[01:37:10.004 --> 01:37:12.227]  They're going to try to drag your women and children off.
[01:37:12.327 --> 01:37:13.628]  You are ready to kill some people.
[01:37:14.309 --> 01:37:15.290]  And you can really fight.
[01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:16.230]  You can go wild.
[01:37:16.731 --> 01:37:24.475]  And always those being attacked statistically have a higher victory rate even when they're overwhelmed than those who are attacking.
[01:37:24.495 --> 01:37:35.382]  Because the guys being attacking are from some big rich tribe who are there to get more women and money and gold for King Booga Booga who's on a power trip back across, you know, the ocean 200 miles away on his island.
[01:37:36.243 --> 01:37:36.603]  Okay?
[01:37:37.304 --> 01:37:40.906]  And so they don't really want to go up the hill and kill these people.
[01:37:42.869 --> 01:37:50.433]  So all this hopping around and tumping cars over, that's meant to defend liberty, your freedom, so you don't go into bondage.
[01:37:50.633 --> 01:37:58.658]  And so when your team wins, you get all irrationally happy because it means you're not going to have your head clubbed in and your women aren't going to be hauled off to be slaves.
[01:38:00.185 --> 01:38:01.446]  That's where that comes from.
[01:38:01.487 --> 01:38:07.253]  See, when I get all animated and excited and angry and upset, that's because I'm ready for war, folks.
[01:38:07.653 --> 01:38:09.636]  I'm waging war against the New World Order.
[01:38:09.936 --> 01:38:13.340]  I am exposing their fraud, their hypocrisy, their dehumanization.
[01:38:13.700 --> 01:38:15.843]  I know they think of us as worse than scum.
[01:38:16.063 --> 01:38:18.466]  They see us as negatives to be removed like trash.
[01:38:23.486 --> 01:38:25.867]  They are burning cars after they turn them over.
[01:38:25.887 --> 01:38:28.088]  I mean, this went on.
[01:38:28.589 --> 01:38:31.250]  Agents, but again, you can't call them illegal aliens.
[01:38:31.290 --> 01:38:33.351]  They have to be called unauthorized immigrants.
[01:38:33.991 --> 01:38:37.433]  Mexican flag-waving Lakers fans riot in L.A.
[01:38:38.733 --> 01:38:38.973]  L.A.
[01:38:39.093 --> 01:38:41.655]  struck by basketball riots.
[01:38:42.679 --> 01:38:46.421]  Despite heavy LAPD presence, violence breaks out after Lakers victory.
[01:38:46.801 --> 01:38:54.665]  Crowds hurl bottles, other objects of police, smash marquees, jump on vehicles, break windows, and light fires along, uh...
[01:38:55.615 --> 01:38:56.195]  Here's another one.
[01:38:56.215 --> 01:39:02.636]  I think this is the LA Times article that had the photo on the page where it shows the family and then you'll notice it's the same white car.
[01:39:02.656 --> 01:39:03.857]  They then set on fire.
[01:39:23.351 --> 01:39:24.952]  Oh, and everybody's smiling.
[01:39:25.253 --> 01:39:28.836]  Oh, it's fun to top this car over full of a family that went to a Lakers game.
[01:39:29.176 --> 01:39:30.758]  I mean, what is wrong with these people?
[01:39:30.798 --> 01:39:37.323]  Well, see, these guys have got what their great-great-great-great-grandfathers had, an instinct to defend themselves and to have war.
[01:39:38.644 --> 01:39:47.973]  But now they go and feel like their team won, so they're so jazzed up for war because they just had a simulated combat, bread and circus, that they've got to go out and have a war.
[01:39:49.229 --> 01:40:04.098]  But see, notice the other warrior class, the police didn't do anything to them, because the police know this is a protected group, you know, the big bosses want the borders open, and so this group's got to be left alone, that's why they riot all the time, because they've been given the message it's okay.
[01:40:05.759 --> 01:40:12.744]  Now, Paul Watson wrote an excellent article that's up on GCN Live, that's GCN, like the network, GCNLive.com,
[01:40:14.651 --> 01:40:19.634]  And it says, what if the Tea Partiers waving Gadsden flags had trashed L.A.?
[01:40:21.435 --> 01:40:26.097]  Story's also up on PrisonPlanet.com, but what if Tea Partiers waving Gadsden flags had trashed L.A.?
[01:40:26.297 --> 01:40:27.558]  Yeah, what would happen?
[01:40:28.919 --> 01:40:29.879]  No, that's not the one.
[01:40:29.899 --> 01:40:30.559]  I don't know.
[01:40:30.579 --> 01:40:31.339]  There's a bunch of L.A.
[01:40:31.359 --> 01:40:31.860]  Times stories.
[01:40:32.300 --> 01:40:32.720]  It's an L.A.
[01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:33.320]  Times story.
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:35.340]  I linked off it off Drudge this morning.
[01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:39.261]  And it shows the family in their car with everybody around it smiling, rocking it.
[01:40:39.281 --> 01:40:40.561]  The car's kind of on its edge.
[01:40:40.761 --> 01:40:41.582]  It's a white car.
[01:40:42.102 --> 01:40:44.482]  And then you read the article later, they turn it over and set it on fire.
[01:40:45.942 --> 01:40:48.603]  Oh, look, we're setting a car on fire full of people.
[01:40:48.903 --> 01:40:51.804]  And again, they didn't go out and find white people's car to burn.
[01:40:52.164 --> 01:40:53.024]  It was other Hispanics.
[01:40:54.139 --> 01:40:59.240]  Just mindless violence, mindless idiocy, mindless craziness.
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:03.601]  It's like black people randomly attacking whites during the L.A.
[01:41:03.661 --> 01:41:04.001]  riots.
[01:41:04.622 --> 01:41:05.562]  Remember Reginald Denny?
[01:41:05.982 --> 01:41:08.122]  Banging his face in to where he had reconstructive surgery.
[01:41:08.142 --> 01:41:09.343]  It was like a flap of skin.
[01:41:12.563 --> 01:41:15.704]  At least the show just waved Mexican flags.
[01:41:16.144 --> 01:41:17.765]  And any group can behave like this.
[01:41:17.825 --> 01:41:22.746]  The point is, political correctness has said it's okay for these groups to do that.
[01:41:24.037 --> 01:41:25.218]  Alright, I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:41:25.238 --> 01:41:26.319]  I'm going to get into all this other news.
[01:41:26.379 --> 01:41:30.803]  Like 10 stories in the news that the BP oil spill is overshadowing.
[01:41:30.923 --> 01:41:33.545]  Very important article up at GCMLive.com.
[01:41:33.565 --> 01:41:41.271]  It also originates from PrisonPlanet.com by Steve Watson, Paul Watson, and myself.
[01:41:42.953 --> 01:41:45.295]  We all worked on this story together this morning.
[01:41:45.315 --> 01:41:48.397]  Let's go ahead and go to Danny in Tejas in Texas.
[01:41:48.417 --> 01:41:48.918]  You're on the air.
[01:41:48.938 --> 01:41:49.298]  Go ahead.
[01:41:50.439 --> 01:41:51.740]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[01:41:52.532 --> 01:41:58.854]  I'm calling in regards to a Fox News report about the ten Afghan soldiers that are missing from Likeland Air Force Base.
[01:42:00.154 --> 01:42:02.975]  This whole report kind of stinks to high heaven.
[01:42:05.435 --> 01:42:09.776]  All of these soldiers appear to have DOD common access cards.
[01:42:10.336 --> 01:42:20.239]  The report says that they have all the credentials to gain access to certain government sites, but also they have been missing for three months.
[01:42:25.878 --> 01:42:33.861]  Some of these attacks are real Muslim extremists, but most of them are double or triple agents who aren't defecting.
[01:42:35.121 --> 01:42:38.543]  Their money, their leader, has been paid by the U.S.
[01:42:38.683 --> 01:42:45.745]  on record, they've been caught over and over again, to go out and tell their low-level idiots, who really believe they're fighting for Allah, to go blow something up.
[01:42:46.225 --> 01:42:48.106]  And that's why it's come out that Israeli, U.S.,
[01:42:48.766 --> 01:42:50.287]  Well, I just thought it was kind of odd that
[01:43:16.809 --> 01:43:37.918]  The Fox News reports that one day after the Beyond Lookout bulletins went out to every law enforcement agency in the country, but a senior law enforcement official says that there appears to be no ties to a terrorist or any other organization like that.
[01:43:38.238 --> 01:43:43.921]  Why would they wait three months to send this out the day before it's released on Fox News?
[01:43:45.287 --> 01:43:50.628]  Because it's all public relations to create the illusion that there are all these Muslims that want to kill us.
[01:43:51.048 --> 01:43:57.330]  They think we're so dumb they admit they put out fake Al-Qaeda videos of Bin Laden and then tell us that Bin Laden's still alive in Iran.
[01:43:57.390 --> 01:44:01.351]  I mean, you know, now they say Al-Qaeda works with the militias.
[01:44:02.531 --> 01:44:06.852]  Al-Qaeda is literally... Bin Laden is like a little play doll with a turban and a beard.
[01:44:07.492 --> 01:44:09.013]  Well, we want to attack the militias?
[01:44:09.073 --> 01:44:09.813]  Say he's with them.
[01:44:10.333 --> 01:44:11.473]  We want to attack Iran?
[01:44:11.533 --> 01:44:12.274]  Say he's with them.
[01:44:12.394 --> 01:44:13.334]  I mean, it's literally
[01:44:15.086 --> 01:44:16.808]  Like planting drugs on someone.
[01:44:16.828 --> 01:44:17.649]  It's just an excuse.
[01:44:17.669 --> 01:44:21.634]  I mean, I feel like you can't believe anything.
[01:44:53.353 --> 01:44:54.374]  American gun owners?
[01:44:55.755 --> 01:44:59.517]  Isn't it great they take your blood secretly for a Pentagon database at birth?
[01:45:00.138 --> 01:45:06.082]  Isn't it great that they're forcing flu vaccines in New York State and Massachusetts?
[01:45:07.002 --> 01:45:10.044]  So there's different types and you learn to recognize it.
[01:45:10.324 --> 01:45:14.627]  Isn't it great we're going to attack Iran because they've got Bin Laden?
[01:45:16.749 --> 01:45:17.810]  Then you can tell
[01:45:19.501 --> 01:45:24.586]  Again, I should write a book or a handbook just on what I've learned because I've totally learned how they operate.
[01:45:24.826 --> 01:45:26.808]  They basically have got game plans.
[01:45:26.828 --> 01:45:27.789]  They've got a playbook.
[01:45:28.690 --> 01:45:31.933]  So, they'll admit horrible things but say they're good.
[01:45:32.253 --> 01:45:34.575]  Or they'll say good things are bad.
[01:45:34.955 --> 01:45:36.316]  Or they'll flat out lie.
[01:45:36.897 --> 01:45:37.738]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[01:45:37.758 --> 01:45:42.302]  I follow you, but it's also surprising to me.
[01:45:42.362 --> 01:45:44.504]  Why is Fox News the only one that's reported it?
[01:45:46.826 --> 01:45:56.608]  I noticed Sky Television, owned by Rupert Murdoch in England, five years ago was saying white Al Qaeda, white people, gun owners, conservatives, secretly are being trained by Bin Laden.
[01:45:57.148 --> 01:46:04.850]  And then I saw these talking points in neocon publications saying I had been raised in Afghanistan as a child, that I was an Al Qaeda operative.
[01:46:05.270 --> 01:46:07.370]  And that was directly from the CIA putting this out.
[01:46:07.650 --> 01:46:10.851]  Didn't matter how crazy it was, it was just meant to confuse people.
[01:46:11.491 --> 01:46:19.497]  And then I told you they're going to announce white Al-Qaeda, and now the last two years they claim that militias and gun owners secretly are all working with Al-Qaeda.
[01:46:20.097 --> 01:46:24.740]  Because they're getting ready to sic homeland security on the American people and say we're all Al-Qaeda.
[01:46:25.521 --> 01:46:28.403]  I mean, all the real training is for the American people to begin with.
[01:46:28.663 --> 01:46:32.886]  But they'll just say, if you're for the Second Amendment or the Tea Party, you're with Al-Qaeda.
[01:46:33.166 --> 01:46:36.309]  And most of these conservatives will go, I'm not for Al-Qaeda, I'm turning my guns in.
[01:46:37.213 --> 01:46:38.795]  Yeah, because nothing's worse than Al Qaeda.
[01:46:38.815 --> 01:46:41.898]  I mean, you understand the brainwashing here, Danny?
[01:46:42.839 --> 01:46:44.561]  Yeah, I understand.
[01:46:44.821 --> 01:46:50.608]  I also wonder if Alex Jones' listeners are going to be on that death list.
[01:46:51.533 --> 01:46:52.394]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:46:52.414 --> 01:46:55.616]  They're not going to want to move with a big giant takeover death list.
[01:46:55.656 --> 01:46:57.197]  They'll just start shutting the web down.
[01:46:57.237 --> 01:46:59.178]  I mean, here's a mainstream, you know, analysis.
[01:46:59.579 --> 01:47:01.920]  Lieberman introduces bill targeting internet freedom.
[01:47:04.062 --> 01:47:06.103]  I mean, this is from Joe Lieberman's own website.
[01:47:06.564 --> 01:47:09.125]  I mean, it's just, they're openly, look, they're crooks!
[01:47:10.006 --> 01:47:12.647]  The entire White House is the most criminal group.
[01:47:12.948 --> 01:47:19.331]  I mean, Bush and Cheney were crooks, but they didn't openly have oil companies pay for their houses, which is completely illegal.
[01:47:19.911 --> 01:47:22.012]  I mean, they just do not care.
[01:47:22.472 --> 01:47:23.773]  They do not care.
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:38.220]  It was good Alex, Mr. Alex Jones.
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:39.521]  It's actually Melvin from New York.
[01:47:59.437 --> 01:48:00.257]  Yeah, yeah, what's good?
[01:48:00.277 --> 01:48:01.878]  We spoke, like, a couple months back.
[01:48:02.058 --> 01:48:05.080]  I just want to tell you, man, I'm agnostic, but God bless you, man.
[01:48:05.860 --> 01:48:16.505]  I think the force that guides the universe is guiding you, because truth stands up by itself, and it's not on a man's integrity that is base, man, and I think you got a lot of it anyway.
[01:48:17.745 --> 01:48:19.806]  I just want to throw quick little sparks at you.
[01:48:19.826 --> 01:48:23.128]  Basically, from out here in New York, thanks to you, I'm waking one or two people up.
[01:48:23.768 --> 01:48:25.329]  It's becoming a police state out here.
[01:48:26.135 --> 01:48:28.737]  It's random searches in the subway.
[01:48:28.837 --> 01:48:31.720]  I mean, it's not like a movie, but it's happening, and it's there.
[01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:35.123]  The table's there, and it says, you are subject to random searches.
[01:48:35.183 --> 01:48:36.024]  No Fourth Amendment.
[01:48:37.044 --> 01:48:39.226]  They give announcements in the subway platforms.
[01:48:39.286 --> 01:48:39.727]  Same thing.
[01:48:39.767 --> 01:48:42.930]  They give announcements in the train while you're riding it.
[01:48:43.190 --> 01:48:51.937]  And every time I go to work, there's military with large machine guns, which goes against... That's against the law, the separation between police and military.
[01:48:52.598 --> 01:48:53.739]  Number two, zeitgeist.
[01:48:54.326 --> 01:49:01.008]  It has a bunch of truth in it, but in the end, it promotes the agenda of the United Nations, which is anti-private property.
[01:49:01.348 --> 01:49:02.609]  You want to get rid of all money.
[01:49:02.649 --> 01:49:04.229]  You're already exposed in an interview.
[01:49:04.249 --> 01:49:13.692]  That's anti-private property, and the United Nations believe the same thing, that that property belongs, quote-unquote, to everyone, and you don't have a right to your own property.
[01:49:13.712 --> 01:49:16.613]  Number three, the rise of the new right is disgusting.
[01:49:17.013 --> 01:49:19.274]  It's an insult to me, personally, as a person.
[01:49:20.993 --> 01:49:25.759]  I didn't grow up, but I was a worshipper of Bill Maher.
[01:49:25.899 --> 01:49:30.424]  And basically, but I mean, Ed Schultz calling for the Fairness Doctrine?
[01:49:30.504 --> 01:49:31.145]  Disgusting.
[01:49:31.846 --> 01:49:35.991]  Yeah, that means the government controls what you can say and what you can't say.
[01:49:36.031 --> 01:49:38.033]  Listen, I've seen no fewer
[01:49:39.014 --> 01:49:51.706]  I haven't even counted 10, 20, 30 articles a day about military checkpoints, regular army at checkpoints, police in Missouri and in Texas and in New York, Vermont, randomly setting up checkpoints.
[01:49:51.746 --> 01:49:52.206]  Here's one.
[01:49:53.377 --> 01:49:53.977]  Uh, right here.
[01:49:53.997 --> 01:50:01.141]  Uh, it says, cops use check lane to solicit information about homicide from Shawnee Police Department.
[01:50:01.181 --> 01:50:16.569]  On Wednesday, June 16, 2010, between 9.30 and 10.30 p.m., the Shawnee Police Department will conduct a check lane at 7600 Block and Northbound Quiviria Road in an effort to solicit information which may be of assistance in the investigation of a homicide of Mr. G's liquor store.
[01:50:16.990 --> 01:50:17.350]  So look,
[01:50:17.890 --> 01:50:24.977]  They just randomly set up a checkpoint and ask you questions, training you to line up, to be stopped, to answer questions.
[01:50:25.558 --> 01:50:26.538]  Nothing to do with crime.
[01:50:26.599 --> 01:50:35.407]  It's all about... Again, I sent my guys to a federal drill in Illinois and they witnessed troops with foreign troops training to take our guns this week.
[01:50:35.507 --> 01:50:36.548]  We have the video.
[01:50:36.869 --> 01:50:38.190]  They didn't even hide it.
[01:50:38.710 --> 01:50:40.912]  They're training the military to take our guns.
[01:50:41.533 --> 01:50:42.214]  Here's another one.
[01:50:43.621 --> 01:50:48.486]  Mayor admits NAFTA superhighway will run through Memphis via Eyewitness News.
[01:50:49.307 --> 01:50:52.691]  And here's the mayor saying we'll have a superhighway from Mexico through.
[01:50:53.111 --> 01:51:00.419]  Meanwhile, CNN says you're a dangerous criminal if you believe there's a North American Union Highway when it's publicly been built in Texas.
[01:51:03.576 --> 01:51:10.166]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings, knowing it may be another bill collector, it's time for you to call Zero Debt in 90 Days.
[01:51:10.186 --> 01:51:12.229]  800-477-9256.
[01:51:13.171 --> 01:51:19.260]  Settlements, bankruptcy, and attorneys are not the answer, and may end up costing you up to 10 times more than necessary.
[01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:23.563]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?
[01:51:23.763 --> 01:51:31.029]  Zero Debt in 90 Days gets you out of debt in 90 days, guaranteed, without a payment plan, and without attorneys or going to court.

[01:51:54.289 --> 01:51:54.830]  That's 800-477-9256.
[01:51:54.950 --> 01:51:58.133]  They helped to create a new world order.
[01:51:58.173 --> 01:52:01.717]  We are part of a new world order.
[01:52:01.977 --> 01:52:03.859]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[01:52:08.523 --> 01:52:13.287]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:52:13.648 --> 01:52:17.851]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:52:18.151 --> 01:52:20.493]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:52:20.514 --> 01:52:23.036]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:52:23.056 --> 01:52:25.958]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:52:26.298 --> 01:52:33.905]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:52:34.225 --> 01:52:39.487]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:52:39.627 --> 01:52:41.907]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:52:41.947 --> 01:52:45.908]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:52:46.148 --> 01:52:47.049]  And I got news for you.
[01:52:47.229 --> 01:52:48.529]  You're everyone else.
[01:52:48.569 --> 01:52:49.569]  Invisible Empire.

[01:52:59.969 --> 01:53:00.512]  You worry.
[01:53:00.672 --> 01:53:02.741]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[01:53:03.022 --> 01:53:03.303]  Hi.
[01:53:03.564 --> 01:53:05.111]  Summer's coming and now's the time to learn.
[01:53:09.053 --> 01:53:10.574]  Remember, there's a learning curve.
[01:53:10.894 --> 01:53:13.055]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[01:53:13.355 --> 01:53:16.437]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[01:53:16.697 --> 01:53:18.418]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[01:53:18.639 --> 01:53:21.160]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[01:53:21.420 --> 01:53:24.862]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[01:53:25.142 --> 01:53:29.245]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[01:53:29.565 --> 01:53:33.347]  And her Wild Cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[01:53:33.647 --> 01:53:38.290]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist.
[01:53:38.470 --> 01:53:39.651]  In weeks, not years.
[01:53:39.971 --> 01:53:42.112]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[01:53:42.333 --> 01:53:44.014]  She's my mom, and I watched her do it.
[01:53:44.454 --> 01:53:48.657]  So go to OfTheField.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:53:49.097 --> 01:53:49.737]  Start now.
[01:53:50.018 --> 01:53:50.978]  Knowledge is power.
[01:53:51.739 --> 01:53:52.539]  Better take action.
[01:53:52.739 --> 01:53:53.680]  I think a storm's coming.
[01:54:10.478 --> 01:54:14.441]  I mean, think how dumb that the establishment thinks you are.
[01:54:14.481 --> 01:54:16.282]  The contempt.
[01:54:17.383 --> 01:54:23.327]  They, for four years, had giant trans-Texas corridor highway signs up everywhere.
[01:54:23.607 --> 01:54:30.572]  They were seizing the existing roads with taxpayer money, building new ones and putting toll roads on it, saying it was going to fund the North American Union.
[01:54:30.832 --> 01:54:32.354]  We had the SPP documents.
[01:54:32.594 --> 01:54:33.895]  The legislature said no.
[01:54:34.015 --> 01:54:35.136]  Rick Perry went ahead with it.
[01:54:35.856 --> 01:54:42.461]  And then I've got video clips of CNN two years ago saying Ron Paul is insane and this doesn't exist.
[01:54:42.881 --> 01:54:49.847]  Now I saw them a month ago saying Rand Paul's nuts on CNN and MSNBC and believes in the Napa Superhighway.
[01:54:50.107 --> 01:54:51.228]  I have the federal documents.
[01:54:51.268 --> 01:54:52.649]  It's on record.
[01:54:52.669 --> 01:54:55.791]  84 national highways to be turned into international trade zones.
[01:54:56.372 --> 01:54:58.213]  The mayor of Kansas City is on record.
[01:54:58.253 --> 01:54:59.894]  The mayor of Memphis is on record.
[01:55:01.348 --> 01:55:04.393]  It's CBS television, you can go watch the stinking video!
[01:55:05.255 --> 01:55:11.366]  I mean, one of the stinking things is four miles from me, the big giant, what is it, what's that big toll road that's part of it?
[01:55:11.766 --> 01:55:11.987]  IH30?
[01:55:14.167 --> 01:55:16.968]  I mean, it is just... Yeah, yeah, 130.
[01:55:17.229 --> 01:55:18.629]  I mean, this stuff is just everywhere.
[01:55:18.949 --> 01:55:23.672]  And then, I... Last year, I saw the headline, France-Texas Corridor Cancelled.
[01:55:23.692 --> 01:55:24.652]  Lost American Statesmen.
[01:55:24.672 --> 01:55:34.217]  And I instantly knew that within the fourth or fifth paragraph they would announce, they were simply renaming it and breaking it into sub-pieces, and that none of it was cancelled.
[01:55:34.377 --> 01:55:35.579]  Because I've seen them do this in Europe.
[01:55:35.819 --> 01:55:36.800]  I've seen them do this in Canada.
[01:55:36.980 --> 01:55:38.142]  I've seen them do this in New Jersey.
[01:55:38.382 --> 01:55:39.183]  I know their tactics.
[01:55:39.504 --> 01:55:44.711]  And the third paragraph, I read it on air, said none of the projects will be cancelled individually.
[01:55:44.731 --> 01:55:49.297]  They're just being broken into individual names and not being called part of the NAFTA highway system.
[01:55:52.625 --> 01:55:56.010]  That's how dumb MSNBC and CNN thinks you are.
[01:55:56.350 --> 01:55:58.473]  That's what scum they think you are.
[01:55:58.533 --> 01:56:06.545]  That's how evil and how deceptive they are as they get up on television and tell you this doesn't exist.
[01:56:07.526 --> 01:56:08.567]  It's like they're still saying there's...
[01:56:09.793 --> 01:56:14.837]  In that Chris Matthews special, I had called in there and said, oh wow, they didn't imply I'm going to kill cops.
[01:56:15.177 --> 01:56:16.318]  They cut me out of that part.
[01:56:16.358 --> 01:56:17.179]  I'm very thankful.
[01:56:17.899 --> 01:56:19.200]  And I was talking to my mom yesterday.
[01:56:19.220 --> 01:56:21.242]  Like I said, I dropped by her house to say hi to my parents.
[01:56:21.702 --> 01:56:25.666]  And I said, mom, they cut the part out where they said that I was going to influence people to shoot cops.
[01:56:25.726 --> 01:56:26.566]  She said, no, they didn't.
[01:56:27.207 --> 01:56:30.349]  They had POTOC from the Southern Poverty Law Center call you Alex.
[01:56:30.830 --> 01:56:33.252]  Like, yeah, we're watching Alex, you know, like personal.
[01:56:33.492 --> 01:56:35.854]  Not Alex Jones, not Mr. Jones, Alex.
[01:56:37.486 --> 01:56:44.172]  That's how much they feel familiar with me as they spy on us and everything else and write demonization reports.
[01:56:44.772 --> 01:56:48.255]  He said, Alex probably isn't going to shoot and kill anybody.
[01:56:48.295 --> 01:56:49.196]  I went back and watched it.
[01:56:50.097 --> 01:56:52.379]  But his followers certainly are.
[01:56:52.979 --> 01:56:55.281]  I mean, you know, that's how these people are operating.
[01:56:55.321 --> 01:56:56.742]  And I'm just flat out of time.
[01:56:57.303 --> 01:56:59.124]  And I'll be back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:56:59.165 --> 01:57:00.085]  I got to a lot of calls.
[01:57:00.125 --> 01:57:01.506]  I apologize to those that are holding.
[01:57:01.907 --> 01:57:02.708]  But we will get to you.
[01:57:05.905 --> 01:57:18.051]  Back on Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., the very important article up on PrisonPlanet.com, 10 stories in the news that BP oil spill is overshadowing, like the impending attack on Iran, and you heard
[01:57:19.571 --> 01:57:24.692]  The doctor earlier concurring with my analysis that that is a serious, serious threat.
[01:57:25.253 --> 01:57:27.633]  We do have some big guests lined up next week, by the way.
[01:57:27.653 --> 01:57:28.894]  You'll definitely want to join us for that.
[01:57:29.514 --> 01:57:32.855]  In closing, I want to also thank the sponsors that have made this show possible.

[01:57:47.859 --> 01:57:54.124]  I'm not 10-year-old crud that most these other companies are selling, and I'm just sorry to say a lot of them are selling old crud, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 years old.
[01:57:54.524 --> 01:57:55.385]  Not eFoodsDirect.
[01:57:55.605 --> 01:58:05.193]  The letter eFoodsDirect.com, just eFoodsDirect.com, links on Infowars.com, or you can simply call toll-free 800-409-5633.

[01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:16.480]  And lastly, I want to thank PureWaterFreedom.com.
