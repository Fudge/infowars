[00:00:05.208 --> 00:00:06.509]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.271]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.271 --> 00:00:10.033]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:11.615]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.615 --> 00:00:13.176]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.176 --> 00:00:17.361]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.361 --> 00:00:21.445]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.596 --> 00:00:36.676]  Yeah.
[00:00:42.338 --> 00:00:46.381]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome and thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:00:46.381 --> 00:01:06.916]  This will be an absolutely jam-packed, vital transmission, as every broadcast is, but as the days and weeks pass, it's more and more clear to everyone that we are in dire straits, and that the world government is making its big move against free humanity, and we are here trying to ring the alarm.
[00:01:08.118 --> 00:01:18.181]  Sounding the alarm on a worldwide scale, rallying the population to fully awaken and take action against the parasite ruling class.
[00:01:18.181 --> 00:01:22.543]  The criminal class that has seized control of our planet.
[00:01:22.543 --> 00:01:27.444]  Illegitimately, fraudulently, criminally, sadistically.
[00:01:27.444 --> 00:01:32.626]  It is not just our right, it is our duty to throw off this oppression.
[00:01:32.626 --> 00:01:32.786]  Now,
[00:01:34.295 --> 00:01:41.279]  They talk to us like children, and tell us to sit down and shut up, and they deny their public operations.
[00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:48.144]  They openly announce world government, world banks taking over, and then if you criticize it, they say sit down, shut up, it doesn't exist.
[00:01:49.764 --> 00:01:57.706]  I was on Man Cow syndicated radio show and they had Blues Travelers, I think it's a pretty good band, in studio with them.
[00:01:57.706 --> 00:02:04.928]  And the guy was making jokes at me, I guess the lead singer, going, well, Mr. Jones, it's like Star Trek.
[00:02:04.928 --> 00:02:06.328]  We're all going to have a one world government.
[00:02:06.328 --> 00:02:09.589]  It's going to be good and happy and friendly.
[00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:11.449]  And I just didn't even really respond to the guy.
[00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:14.870]  I just said, look, pal, if they get what they want in place,
[00:02:17.165 --> 00:02:19.887]  The globalists plan to kill the majority of the world population.
[00:02:19.887 --> 00:02:28.092]  They're already putting poison in your water, poison in your food, poison in your shots, and he just laughed.
[00:02:28.092 --> 00:02:44.743]  It's so funny to them because it's a childlike, decadent brain out there that has lived in the lap of luxury, in a free republic, and now the free republic is dying, it's in its death throes, it's in agony, bleeding from thousands of cuts.
[00:02:48.891 --> 00:03:01.155]  And all these people that are just so weak-minded have no idea, no idea about history or what governments do or what elites have done.
[00:03:01.155 --> 00:03:17.780]  And that's why this tyranny we face is so horrible because never has there been a more decadent, slug-like, spiritually obese, slovenly group of people than we have in the major cities of the industrialized world.
[00:03:19.448 --> 00:03:45.185]  They are just spoiled, rotten brats who are completely brainwashed on decadence and weakness and mindlessness, and who think it's cute to laugh at those warning them, who think it's fun to be ignorant, who just revel in their weakness and their patheticness.
[00:03:45.185 --> 00:03:46.486]  They revel in it.
[00:03:49.741 --> 00:03:54.725]  Let me tell you something, the New World Order revels in poisoning you.
[00:03:54.725 --> 00:04:00.069]  They revel in putting cancer viruses and aluminum and mercury in your shots.
[00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:06.154]  They revel in engineering the GMO to give you cancer and to sterilize you, on record.
[00:04:06.154 --> 00:04:10.617]  They revel in chemtrailing you with aluminum dioxide and barium salts.
[00:04:10.617 --> 00:04:14.220]  They enjoy, they relish, they love
[00:04:15.592 --> 00:04:35.584]  Like a gardener loves planting rose bushes, or picking peas off a vine, or someone who runs a vineyard and loves making the wine, the New World Order likes bashing weaklings like you brains out.
[00:04:37.483 --> 00:04:39.164]  Well, not me.
[00:04:39.164 --> 00:04:41.206]  I have the courage to face reality.
[00:04:41.206 --> 00:04:42.187]  I know reality.
[00:04:42.187 --> 00:04:43.308]  I know I'm right.
[00:04:43.308 --> 00:04:51.274]  We have thousands of the enemy's own internal documents that have fallen into our hands thanks to great sacrifice and many people that were killed for it.
[00:04:51.274 --> 00:04:54.917]  And we are going to stand up against this dehumanizing force.
[00:04:54.917 --> 00:04:56.538]  We'll be right back with all the news.
[00:04:56.538 --> 00:04:57.299]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.655 --> 00:05:07.319]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:12.463]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:05:12.463 --> 00:05:21.189]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:23.670]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.213]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:05:29.677 --> 00:05:34.260]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.083]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[00:05:38.083 --> 00:05:39.344]  Others don't.
[00:05:39.344 --> 00:05:41.485]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:05:41.485 --> 00:05:43.267]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:05:43.267 --> 00:05:46.149]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:50.232]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[00:05:50.232 --> 00:05:52.793]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:05:52.793 --> 00:05:55.495]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:05:55.495 --> 00:05:57.857]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[00:05:57.857 --> 00:05:58.718]  Others don't.
[00:06:02.938 --> 00:06:05.400]  And you're subject to other police action.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.661]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:06.661 --> 00:06:10.463]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:10.463 --> 00:06:12.825]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:12.825 --> 00:06:18.709]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:24.934]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:25.354 --> 00:06:31.316]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:31.316 --> 00:06:35.517]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:06:35.517 --> 00:06:39.798]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:39.798 --> 00:06:45.740]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.281]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:49.281 --> 00:06:51.282]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:51.282 --> 00:06:51.702]  It's here.

[00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:09.300]  Congratulations!
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:15.745]  Your choice to participate in the production of your food supply by pre-ordering will prove very wise.
[00:07:15.745 --> 00:07:20.809]  Shipments will begin the end of March and will be sent in the order that they were received.
[00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:21.929]  Now something fun.
[00:07:21.929 --> 00:07:22.690]  It's springtime.
[00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:30.796]  We all know that garden seeds aren't really a food supply, but they're a great supplement to your food reserve if you have the time and place to garden.
[00:07:30.796 --> 00:07:31.697]  Here's the plan.
[00:07:31.697 --> 00:07:40.604]  When you add a one-month Superfood Spring Pack to your food storage, we'll send you that garden of non-hybrid seeds absolutely free.

[00:08:02.304 --> 00:08:08.927]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.927 --> 00:08:12.609]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:12.609 --> 00:08:14.570]  We are live.
[00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:18.812]  It is April 14th, 2010 on this Wednesday edition.
[00:08:18.812 --> 00:08:28.876]  The day before, the fleecing of the American people with the illegal unconstitutional income tax paid directly to the private Federal Reserve banking cartel.
[00:08:30.157 --> 00:08:37.781]  Gerald Salente, Top Trends Forecaster, will be with us for a full two hours today in the third and fourth hour.
[00:08:37.781 --> 00:08:46.186]  All right, let me just read over the headlines and then I'm going to go back through these stacks.
[00:08:46.186 --> 00:08:50.749]  Gold rises aided by weaker dollar.
[00:08:52.708 --> 00:08:53.869]  Gold higher as U.S.
[00:08:53.869 --> 00:08:55.230]  dollar index weakens.
[00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.531]  Crude oil rallies.
[00:08:57.531 --> 00:09:01.894]  IMF prepares for global cataclysm.
[00:09:01.894 --> 00:09:07.877]  Twelve reasons why millions of Americans are incredibly angry about the state of the U.S.
[00:09:07.877 --> 00:09:09.498]  economy.
[00:09:09.498 --> 00:09:10.639]  Nearly half of U.S.
[00:09:10.639 --> 00:09:13.461]  households escape federal income tax.
[00:09:13.461 --> 00:09:15.602]  They've been running these stories the last week.
[00:09:15.602 --> 00:09:16.883]  Total lie.
[00:09:16.883 --> 00:09:18.944]  None of you escape it.
[00:09:18.944 --> 00:09:20.945]  None of you escape it.
[00:09:20.945 --> 00:09:21.466]  I'll explain.
[00:09:24.448 --> 00:09:31.530]  Tory lead narrows amid huge voter disenchantment.
[00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:37.292]  Club of Rome behind eco-fascist purge to criminalize climate skepticism.
[00:09:37.292 --> 00:09:44.254]  EU moving to make it illegal to criticize the environmental criminals that want to take over society.

[00:09:48.035 --> 00:09:50.096]  Yes!
[00:09:50.096 --> 00:09:52.457]  Yes, conservatives are learning who their leadership is.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:59.221]  Oath Keepers Withdraws From DC Rally Over Violent Threats.

[00:10:12.843 --> 00:10:17.204]  We now have new video from the crash where you can hear gunshots.
[00:10:17.204 --> 00:10:19.885]  It looks like the crash, looks like the same woods.
[00:10:19.885 --> 00:10:21.165]  We don't know if that's real.
[00:10:21.165 --> 00:10:21.845]  We're going to cover it.
[00:10:23.041 --> 00:10:26.755]  Vatican under fire for linking gays to pedophilia.
[00:10:28.066 --> 00:10:31.529]  Well, I mean, that's like linking fish to water.
[00:10:31.529 --> 00:10:37.894]  It's not saying all gay people do that, but most of the priests that are doing this are homosexual.
[00:10:37.894 --> 00:10:38.895]  They also like children.
[00:10:38.895 --> 00:10:44.519]  I mean, you can have heterosexual pedophiles, but this is predominantly homosexual pedophiles.
[00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:48.322]  I mean, you can't say the sky is blue and water is wet.
[00:10:48.322 --> 00:10:49.783]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[00:10:49.783 --> 00:10:51.545]  I mean, they can't have their cake and eat it, too.
[00:10:51.545 --> 00:10:54.367]  Criticizing the Catholic Church needs to be criticized.
[00:10:54.367 --> 00:10:56.369]  But the Catholic Church is pointing out what's going on here.
[00:10:58.035 --> 00:11:04.922]  Brown takes on Murdoch over web paywalls, Financial Times of London.
[00:11:04.922 --> 00:11:10.187]  Army to court-martial birther officer, MSNBC.

[00:11:14.861 --> 00:11:20.644]  And that dovetails with nuclear blast victims would have to wait for federal aid.
[00:11:20.644 --> 00:11:23.465]  Obama says terrorist nuke risk is growing.
[00:11:23.465 --> 00:11:27.687]  Yeah, the risk of them staging it is certainly growing.
[00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:36.511]  Election 2012, Barack Obama 42%, Ron Paul 41 in a major poll.
[00:11:36.511 --> 00:11:43.835]  That is just some of what is coming up today.
[00:11:46.271 --> 00:11:54.983]  There's also another article at InfoWars.com by Cassandra Anderson, epic corruption and the whistleblower.
[00:11:54.983 --> 00:12:02.853]  You've heard about the whistleblower Supreme Court case, and you've heard about laws in Congress trying to repeal whistleblower protection.
[00:12:07.864 --> 00:12:09.745]  They are now arresting U.S.
[00:12:09.745 --> 00:12:12.706]  citizens that expose government corruption.
[00:12:12.706 --> 00:12:15.707]  We have Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joining us on Tax Day tomorrow.
[00:12:15.707 --> 00:12:19.889]  He sent us this original video and now we've written an article about it at Infowars.com.
[00:12:19.889 --> 00:12:24.791]  We're going to work on getting a local group in Los Angeles that's been exposing this on the show.
[00:12:24.791 --> 00:12:30.694]  It is just unbelievable until you realize that it's actually happening in America.
[00:12:30.694 --> 00:12:32.595]  That is some of what is coming up.
[00:12:35.549 --> 00:12:37.490]  I was on with Popper.
[00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:39.790]  What's his first name, Jaren?
[00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:40.430]  John Popper.
[00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:43.851]  Jaren knows some of the people from Blues Traveler.
[00:12:43.851 --> 00:12:52.693]  I was on Mancow Muller this morning, as I am every Wednesday morning, for about 15 minutes, and I couldn't even get a word in edgewise.
[00:12:52.693 --> 00:12:55.134]  John Popper, a Blues Traveler.
[00:12:56.755 --> 00:13:08.002]  was making jokes about world government and government-sponsored terror and saying world government doesn't exist but if it did it'd be a good thing because he likes Star Trek and world government is in Star Trek.
[00:13:08.002 --> 00:13:09.924]  But that's just the natural function of things.
[00:13:09.924 --> 00:13:17.309]  So it doesn't exist even though it's all being announced and it's authoritarian, unelected, run by eugenicist banks.
[00:13:17.309 --> 00:13:23.653]  So it doesn't exist, that's double think, and crime stop, Orwellian terms, but
[00:13:25.017 --> 00:13:26.539]  It doesn't exist, but it is good.
[00:13:26.539 --> 00:13:27.159]  You have to understand.
[00:13:27.159 --> 00:13:31.384]  And it's very funny.
[00:13:31.384 --> 00:13:39.193]  No, this nation, this world, going into hardcore bondage is not funny.
[00:13:39.193 --> 00:13:39.794]  It's not cute.
[00:13:41.144 --> 00:13:55.151]  The super-rich, who are immune from taxes at the international level, are now sucking dry the producers of this country and making the majority of the population dependent on them.
[00:13:55.151 --> 00:13:56.491]  That isn't cute.
[00:13:56.491 --> 00:13:57.352]  That isn't funny.
[00:13:58.444 --> 00:14:14.436]  And what did Patrick Henry say in a speech at the Virginia Convention, March 23rd, 1775, as the states were preparing, the colonies, who were about to become states, were preparing to go to Philadelphia and vote for independence and the Declaration of Independence?
[00:14:14.436 --> 00:14:19.660]  It is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope.
[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:28.087]  We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth and listen to the song at the siren till she transforms us into beast.
[00:14:30.422 --> 00:14:36.287]  Is this the part of wise men engaged in the great and arduous struggle for liberty?
[00:14:36.287 --> 00:14:48.876]  Are we disposed to be of the number of those who having eyes see not and having ears hear not the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation?
[00:14:48.876 --> 00:14:59.725]  For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it might cost, I am willing to know the whole truth, to know the worst, and to provide for it.
[00:15:01.414 --> 00:15:04.736]  To prepare for it.
[00:15:04.736 --> 00:15:07.999]  Patrick Henry, 1775.
[00:15:07.999 --> 00:15:20.708]  I am disgusted by slugs, by people that live in denial, who worship at the feet of the goddess denial.
[00:15:20.708 --> 00:15:23.550]  Those who worship at the feet of rationalization.
[00:15:24.676 --> 00:15:24.816]  Yeah.
[00:15:41.619 --> 00:15:57.746]  All around us, devouring our people, destroying our name, turning us into chattel debt slaves as a paramilitary web descends and tightens around our throats like a 14-foot boa constrictor.
[00:16:03.214 --> 00:16:08.616]  I know not what course he will take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death.
[00:16:08.616 --> 00:16:16.900]  I will not be transformed into a beast, into a servile, domesticated, dumb animal.
[00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:27.444]  I am free as my forefathers were, and I will fight until the end that my progeny and their progeny will enjoy the fruits of liberty.
[00:16:29.346 --> 00:16:34.367]  That's why I study history and politics and the art of info war.
[00:16:34.367 --> 00:16:43.030]  So that my children and their children may be free men and women who can travel to the stars.
[00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.431]  I fear not death of my body.
[00:16:46.431 --> 00:16:52.052]  I fear not death of my name or the destruction of my treasure.
[00:16:52.052 --> 00:16:55.313]  But I do fear for the species.
[00:16:55.313 --> 00:16:57.414]  We are all part of a greater family.
[00:16:57.414 --> 00:16:58.374]  I fear for
[00:17:00.026 --> 00:17:01.688]  Our race.
[00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:04.310]  I fear for our civilization.
[00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:21.526]  I know that the worst of man are in control of society and are rapidly accelerating their program of dehumanization and wanton bloodlust and sadistic destruction on a scale the planet has never even imagined.
[00:17:27.677 --> 00:17:37.720]  I know the true nature and the mind of our enemy and that is why I'm so disgusted with those that are willfully and aggressively ignorant.
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:55.206]  They're not just ignorant, they love their ignorance and they hate those of us who are not ignorant and who are animated with the incredible spirit of liberty in this contest against the control freaks and against lesser men.
[00:17:58.493 --> 00:18:10.660]  Against the envious, against the controlling, against the petty, who form collectives and armies against free mankind.
[00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:24.928]  I am here to rally humans who have liberty and freedom burning volcanically in their breast, infusing their bones with titanium fury.
[00:18:26.148 --> 00:18:36.718]  Animating our minds with a brush fire that will spread across the planet and sweep the disease of collectivism away.
[00:18:36.718 --> 00:18:44.606]  I pledge everything I am, everything I'll ever be,
[00:18:46.107 --> 00:18:51.029]  My family, my treasure, my honor, everything in this contest.
[00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:57.571]  Because when you understand what we're facing, you realize there is no other choice.
[00:18:57.571 --> 00:19:03.633]  There is no other course that we can take.
[00:19:03.633 --> 00:19:12.876]  And I challenge our listeners and our great activists who support us and InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and the films and all the work we do.
[00:19:14.178 --> 00:19:32.591]  To redouble your efforts and to not see Alex Jones as your leader, but to see God and the animating spirit of liberty that flows from our Creator as our King and as our model to stand against darkness.
[00:19:32.591 --> 00:19:33.832]  When you build me up,
[00:19:35.094 --> 00:19:44.240]  You pull yourself down thinking that I'm here on the front lines, your champion, David against Goliath.
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:48.082]  When our course is all of us, David against Goliath.
[00:19:48.082 --> 00:19:59.309]  All of us realizing that it's up to you, looking in the mirror, to become animated with freedom, to set your soul on fire, and to step up on the battlefield.

[00:20:55.473 --> 00:20:56.794]  Standberts.com.
[00:20:56.794 --> 00:20:59.257]  Hunting and preparedness supplies you can't live without.
[00:21:00.422 --> 00:21:10.444]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[00:21:10.444 --> 00:21:16.885]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[00:21:16.885 --> 00:21:25.727]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[00:21:26.107 --> 00:21:35.291]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[00:21:35.291 --> 00:21:40.292]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[00:21:40.292 --> 00:21:41.693]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:41.693 --> 00:21:44.194]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[00:21:44.494 --> 00:21:47.817]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.

[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:52.881]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[00:21:52.881 --> 00:21:53.241]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:00.376 --> 00:22:02.777]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:22:02.777 --> 00:22:05.078]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:22:05.078 --> 00:22:08.299]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:22:08.299 --> 00:22:13.401]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:22:13.401 --> 00:22:17.602]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:22:17.922 --> 00:22:20.385]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:22:20.385 --> 00:22:22.809]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:22:22.809 --> 00:22:26.073]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:22:26.073 --> 00:22:33.683]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:22:34.003 --> 00:22:39.385]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:22:39.385 --> 00:22:41.706]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:22:41.706 --> 00:22:45.927]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:22:45.927 --> 00:22:47.008]  And I got news for you.
[00:22:47.008 --> 00:22:48.328]  You're everyone else.
[00:22:48.328 --> 00:22:49.829]  Invisible Empire.

[00:23:00.056 --> 00:23:01.797]  Oh, my sinuses!
[00:23:01.797 --> 00:23:03.738]  They feel like they'll explode!
[00:23:03.738 --> 00:23:04.558]  Sinus pressure.
[00:23:04.558 --> 00:23:06.319]  Sinus headaches that keep you up at night.
[00:23:06.319 --> 00:23:07.579]  You've struggled for years.
[00:23:07.579 --> 00:23:13.422]  You've tried everything to get relief, but your sinus distress just keeps coming back and robbing you of the healthy life you deserve.
[00:23:13.422 --> 00:23:14.182]  Sound familiar?
[00:23:14.182 --> 00:23:15.222]  Well, you're not alone.
[00:23:15.222 --> 00:23:18.884]  Statistics show that 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress.
[00:23:18.884 --> 00:23:23.926]  Fact is, 67 products merely treat the symptoms and don't get to the cause of your sinus problem.
[00:23:23.926 --> 00:23:26.567]  Now there's a solution that's safe and doctor-recommended.
[00:23:26.567 --> 00:23:28.848]  Sinofresh homeopathic antiseptic nasal spray.
[00:23:32.534 --> 00:23:32.974]  I think so.
[00:24:18.748 --> 00:24:21.450]  Oh, they did lots of bad, bad things.
[00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:28.576]  Let's get into the economy and then I'll get into the nuclear false flag hype coming out of
[00:24:47.014 --> 00:25:06.373]  The Barry Sitaro aka Barack Obama White House IMF prepares for global cataclysm This is from Zero Hedge, Mark Faber All the pundits
[00:25:07.858 --> 00:25:13.520]  Thought that the IMF would be on the hook for just 10 billion pounds.
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:25.485]  The IMF has just announced that it is expanding its new arrangement to borrow multilateral facilities from its existing 50 billion by a whopping 500 billion to 550 billion.
[00:25:27.446 --> 00:25:40.275]  The current lending participant group of 26 entities, that's our nation's tax money, will be increased by 13 new members, all of whom will contribute token amounts of capital.
[00:25:40.275 --> 00:25:48.521]  The one country most on the hook for the IMF expansion is the United States of America.
[00:25:48.521 --> 00:25:48.981]  That's right.
[00:25:50.532 --> 00:25:57.037]  Hundreds of billions a year going to the IMF and World Bank for private banks to be able to use the money to go in and take over.
[00:25:57.037 --> 00:26:04.343]  State governments in the United States, national governments on a planetary scale to take over private corporations.
[00:26:04.343 --> 00:26:06.205]  They use your money.
[00:26:06.205 --> 00:26:15.152]  500 billion to 550 billion additional dollars and pounds, euros, however you calculate it,
[00:26:17.509 --> 00:26:45.747]  Meanwhile, the entire income tax only brings in $900 billion a year, and every stinking cent of it goes to the regional arm of the IMF and World Bank, the Federal Reserve, the enemy of the Republic, the parasitic wart-covered giant tick that sits atop our nation, sucking us dry.
[00:26:49.389 --> 00:27:02.641]  The IMF says they're doing this getting ready for a global financial collapse.
[00:27:02.641 --> 00:27:06.565]  We have New Jersey, we have Illinois, we have California, we have Michigan.
[00:27:08.047 --> 00:27:23.792]  And as many as, in some numbers, 20 plus states, a lot of news says 10 states, on the verge or already in bankruptcy with the federal government coming in with more taxpayer money.
[00:27:23.792 --> 00:27:36.397]  And then interest is paid to the private banks for our right to use the supposed public money as they debase the currency further and gold explodes in price.
[00:27:38.359 --> 00:27:41.823]  Great story from economic collapse up at Infowars.com.
[00:27:41.823 --> 00:27:46.087]  Twelve reasons why millions of Americans are incredibly angry about the state of the U.S.
[00:27:46.087 --> 00:27:46.568]  economy.
[00:27:47.765 --> 00:27:54.929]  Number one, there simply are not enough jobs for everyone and those that are there are lower paying as the taxes go up.
[00:27:54.929 --> 00:27:58.571]  Number two, more Americans than ever find themselves having to rely on the U.S.
[00:27:58.571 --> 00:28:00.032]  government just to survive.
[00:28:00.032 --> 00:28:00.892]  According to the U.S.
[00:28:00.892 --> 00:28:07.816]  Department of Agriculture, 39.4 million Americans, a new all-time record, received food stamps in January.
[00:28:07.816 --> 00:28:09.017]  That's the modern soup line.
[00:28:10.148 --> 00:28:12.108]  This was up 22% from the year earlier.
[00:28:12.108 --> 00:28:18.750]  In fact, the number of Americans on food stamps has set an all-time record for 14 consecutive months.
[00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:23.330]  Number three, foreclosures continue to set records across the United States.
[00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:30.772]  And as I told you a year and a half ago, the banks took the trillions and then shut down lending because they want to destroy the economy so they can consolidate it.
[00:28:30.772 --> 00:28:38.113]  Reality Track, the California-based authority on property trends and valuations, projects there will be 4.5 million home foreclosures before the end of the year.
[00:28:40.256 --> 00:28:47.740]  If you figure four people per household, that is another 18 million people that will be forced out of their homes.
[00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:56.044]  Number four, as unemployment and foreclosures continue to soar, tent slums have started popping up all over the United States.
[00:28:56.044 --> 00:29:00.926]  And states like New York are pushing for a tax on these people.
[00:29:00.926 --> 00:29:09.691]  Is this why our founding fathers fought and died, so we could all live in tent slums as big fat cats on Wall Street roll around in their bailout cash?
[00:29:12.096 --> 00:29:18.579]  And Neil Armstrong is criticizing Obama for talking about slashing the, what, 10 billion bucks a year or so that NASA gets?
[00:29:18.579 --> 00:29:24.461]  That's nothing compared to the 1.8 trillion the Pentagon gets.
[00:29:24.461 --> 00:29:28.983]  1.1 trillion on budget, another 700 or even more.
[00:29:28.983 --> 00:29:34.105]  Billion on top of that, and they're talking about getting rid of NASA, basically.
[00:29:37.369 --> 00:29:38.910]  I'm not saying it's good one way or the other.
[00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:45.154]  The point is, you get 28 trillion to the banks the last year and a half, NASA can't have 10 billion.
[00:29:45.154 --> 00:29:51.017]  They've got to cut your Sheriff's Department by half, because everything has to go to the bankers!
[00:29:51.017 --> 00:29:52.418]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.418 --> 00:29:54.939]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.939 --> 00:29:57.641]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.055 --> 00:30:04.079]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:04.079 --> 00:30:09.406]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.406 --> 00:30:11.449]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.449 --> 00:30:16.455]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.455 --> 00:30:17.637]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.637 --> 00:30:18.378]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.758 --> 00:30:20.641]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.641 --> 00:30:21.702]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.702 --> 00:30:23.925]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.925 --> 00:30:25.247]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:25.247 --> 00:30:26.789]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:32.056]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:32.056 --> 00:30:35.181]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.621 --> 00:30:39.445]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.445 --> 00:30:40.666]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.666 --> 00:30:41.586]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.586 --> 00:30:42.687]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.687 --> 00:30:43.608]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.608 --> 00:30:44.709]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.709 --> 00:30:47.752]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[00:31:02.964 --> 00:31:05.386]  You're subject to public police action.
[00:31:05.386 --> 00:31:06.627]  Tyranny is here.
[00:31:06.627 --> 00:31:10.490]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:12.812]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:31:12.812 --> 00:31:18.678]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:31:18.678 --> 00:31:24.883]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:31:25.323 --> 00:31:31.324]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:31:31.324 --> 00:31:35.485]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:31:35.485 --> 00:31:39.766]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:31:39.766 --> 00:31:45.727]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:31:45.727 --> 00:31:49.287]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:31:49.287 --> 00:31:51.248]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:31:51.248 --> 00:31:51.688]  It's here.

[00:33:42.096 --> 00:33:51.303]  The number one and number two top independent news websites in the world, InfoWars.com and PresidentPlanet.com.
[00:33:51.303 --> 00:33:56.748]  Thank you all for helping us get the word out and making our InfoWar the success it's been.
[00:33:56.748 --> 00:34:07.156]  And we're growing exponentially and the enemy can see that exponential growth curve and is worried and so we're taking heavy enemy demonization fire in the InfoWar.
[00:34:07.156 --> 00:34:08.918]  That means we're over the target.
[00:34:08.918 --> 00:34:11.640]  We will continue to pound them and pound them hard.
[00:34:13.746 --> 00:34:16.466]  And I want to thank you all for replenishing our treasury.
[00:34:18.877 --> 00:34:19.798]  In the info war.
[00:34:19.798 --> 00:34:26.401]  You do that by buying ball caps, t-shirts, the ball caps and t-shirts and bumper stickers and citizen rule books.
[00:34:26.401 --> 00:34:30.223]  Get the word out about who we are, what we stand for.
[00:34:30.223 --> 00:34:33.385]  That's the main event, but it also supports our operations.
[00:34:33.385 --> 00:34:35.666]  Two new films coming out in the next week.
[00:34:35.666 --> 00:34:37.387]  Tomorrow at 3 p.m.
[00:34:37.387 --> 00:34:44.031]  Central, when the radio show ends, we will launch at PrisonPlanet.tv the two-hour, 20-plus minute film.
[00:34:47.085 --> 00:34:49.247]  Or PrisonPlanet.TV subscribers.
[00:34:49.247 --> 00:34:54.551]  It will premiere there at PrisonPlanet.TV, Invisible Empire, New Order Defined.
[00:34:54.551 --> 00:34:59.235]  And yes, we're shipping the DVDs out yesterday and today for Invisible Empire.
[00:34:59.235 --> 00:35:05.541]  So many of you will be getting them today and tomorrow and by Friday all over the United States.
[00:35:07.404 --> 00:35:12.408]  Unless you ordered it with Police State 4 The Rise of FEMA, then that starts shipping out next week.
[00:35:12.408 --> 00:35:17.832]  We have a discount where you can order both DVDs together and save $5 on the two new films.
[00:35:17.832 --> 00:35:19.953]  Those will be shipping out next week.
[00:35:19.953 --> 00:35:22.295]  Those DVDs, some of those have already arrived.
[00:35:22.295 --> 00:35:26.798]  The rest are arriving next week for Police State 4 The Rise of FEMA.
[00:35:26.798 --> 00:35:28.319]  Why are both these films so important?
[00:35:28.319 --> 00:35:34.364]  Well, one shows the globalist history of crime, their current operations, how they set up front groups, roundtable groups.
[00:35:36.249 --> 00:35:40.373]  Amazing film, 18 months in the making, and a year in the making.
[00:35:40.373 --> 00:35:58.269]  Police State for the Rise of FEMA shows the sound cannons, the microwave guns, the FEMA camps without a shadow of a doubt, the COG system, the executive orders, the Governor's Council, Homeland Security, NORTHCOM, riot police attacking citizens, troops on the streets, troops doing gun confiscation drills nationwide in places like Iowa.
[00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:00.781]  Hardin, Montana.
[00:36:00.781 --> 00:36:04.883]  I mean, it's two hours, 20-plus minutes long, 30 minutes of extras.
[00:36:04.883 --> 00:36:09.705]  There's three hours of material on both DVDs, and I want to thank all of you that have ordered the films.
[00:36:09.705 --> 00:36:11.466]  You make what we do here possible.

[00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:21.932]  Be part of history on the side of justice and the truth.

[00:36:32.838 --> 00:36:38.661]  Or see them both at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:36:38.661 --> 00:36:47.025]  You can also watch the live TV show we do each day in the third and fourth hour, sometimes the whole show, but always the third and fourth hour.
[00:36:47.025 --> 00:36:49.026]  All my previous films in high quality.
[00:36:49.026 --> 00:36:52.048]  My book, Paul Watson's book, both out of print now, e-versions there.
[00:36:52.768 --> 00:37:00.750]  Thousands and thousands of radio shows, a higher quality 64-bit podcast, 64 kilobit audio on the video.
[00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:05.012]  It's all there at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:37:05.012 --> 00:37:08.673]  Okay.
[00:37:08.673 --> 00:37:15.055]  Why do central banks, when they take over a nation, private central banks, with the Federal Reserve Act here, Bank of England in England,
[00:37:16.601 --> 00:37:22.909]  The Communist Manifesto 1917, when they took over, why do they set up a central bank and an income tax?
[00:37:22.909 --> 00:37:26.112]  Because this is global government of, for, and by the central banks.
[00:37:26.112 --> 00:37:29.496]  This is a global banking dictatorship.
[00:37:30.632 --> 00:37:38.336]  Now openly announced, world government, global constitution signed by the banks that our countries will supposedly follow.
[00:37:38.336 --> 00:37:57.547]  Carbon taxes, energy taxes, increased income taxes, value added taxes, increased sales taxes, as they basically get rid of NASA, as they slash the sheriff's departments and fire departments, as they slash your precious welfare, as they slash the student loans, as they increase the interest rates.
[00:37:59.418 --> 00:38:10.386]  Everything in a Nigerian or Argentine or we've seen in other parts of Europe where the banks have done this, over 90% of the money ends up going to the bankers.
[00:38:10.386 --> 00:38:12.908]  Already 100% of the income tax goes to them.
[00:38:12.908 --> 00:38:18.132]  All the other federal taxes and regulations and tariffs, that funds the government.
[00:38:19.059 --> 00:38:21.900]  But the banks don't want the government funded and not in debt.
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:22.920]  They want it in debt.
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:23.880]  That's why they lobby.
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:27.361]  That's why they give unfunded mandates to the health care bill to the states.
[00:38:27.361 --> 00:38:30.842]  Bankrupt, bankrupt, bankrupt, bankrupt, bankrupt.
[00:38:30.842 --> 00:38:34.944]  And the Ponzi scheme operators don't go to jail at the end of the Ponzi scheme.
[00:38:34.944 --> 00:38:36.204]  They become dictators.
[00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:51.384]  It's elementary, and I know you know this as listeners, but if we don't get the word out, they're going to win, continuing with 12 reasons why millions of Americans are angry about the state of the U.S.
[00:38:51.384 --> 00:38:51.765]  economy.
[00:38:57.839 --> 00:39:02.160]  As unemployment and foreclosures continue to soar, tent slums have sprouted up.
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:05.601]  But even with all these economic problems, the price of food is going up.
[00:39:05.601 --> 00:39:09.382]  And many states are passing sales taxes on food now.
[00:39:09.382 --> 00:39:14.784]  Rising demand and reduced supply drove supermarket prices from 16 basic foods up 16.5%.
[00:39:16.394 --> 00:39:19.616]  Up 6.2% in the first quarter of this year.
[00:39:19.616 --> 00:39:30.322]  Due to the exploding government debt, the American people are going to be confronted with some tough choices according to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke.
[00:39:30.322 --> 00:39:34.905]  States will soon have to make difficult choices between higher taxes and reduced social spending.
[00:39:35.405 --> 00:39:37.206]  Either alternative will slow down the U.S.
[00:39:37.206 --> 00:39:37.947]  economy.
[00:39:37.947 --> 00:39:44.291]  Bernanke recommends the private bank owner of America increase taxes.
[00:39:44.291 --> 00:39:48.814]  And now they have all their puppets on the left and right parroting that.
[00:39:48.814 --> 00:39:49.514]  Number seven.
[00:39:49.514 --> 00:39:53.096]  Meanwhile, corruption in the financial system is running rampant.
[00:39:53.096 --> 00:39:55.118]  The CEOs of bailed out regional banks are
[00:39:56.428 --> 00:39:57.649]  Actually getting big raises.
[00:39:57.649 --> 00:40:03.851]  The guy who helped bring down AIG is going to get off scot-free and will be able to keep millions of profits that he made in the process.
[00:40:03.851 --> 00:40:04.871]  Number eight.
[00:40:04.871 --> 00:40:09.153]  But the biggest fraud is being committed by the boys at the top of the food chain.
[00:40:09.153 --> 00:40:16.756]  Whistleblowers come forward with smoking gun evidence of price manipulation by major financial institutions in the precious metals markets.
[00:40:16.756 --> 00:40:18.997]  In fact, I want to get that whistleblower on from GATA.
[00:40:21.601 --> 00:40:22.903]  Guys, we had that last week.
[00:40:22.903 --> 00:40:23.904]  We need that.
[00:40:23.904 --> 00:40:27.448]  The scope of this fraud is the trillions of dollars.
[00:40:27.448 --> 00:40:30.652]  The American people can't stomach much more of this type of thing.
[00:40:30.652 --> 00:40:38.282]  Number nine, almost all financial experts agree that the era of super cheap money is over and that interest rates are about to rise significantly.
[00:40:38.282 --> 00:40:39.083]  Less jobs.
[00:40:39.904 --> 00:40:44.126]  Bigger government, more taxes, devalued currency.
[00:40:44.126 --> 00:40:52.850]  This is going to make things much more expensive for most Americans to borrow money, to buy a home, to buy a car, to buy things with their credit cards, or to borrow money for education.
[00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:54.751]  Because now they've got us where they want us, deep in debt.
[00:40:54.751 --> 00:40:56.012]  Now they're cutting it off.
[00:40:56.012 --> 00:41:01.635]  Those who already have adjustable loans are going to find a much larger portion of their income going to pay interest.
[00:41:01.635 --> 00:41:03.416]  Needless to say, this is going to cause the U.S.
[00:41:03.416 --> 00:41:05.897]  economy to experience a significant slowdown.
[00:41:07.677 --> 00:41:11.401]  And then we go more into debt at the state and federal level and the bankers cheer.
[00:41:11.401 --> 00:41:18.247]  Number 10, one of the biggest things the American people are upset about is the health care reform bill that was just rammed down their throats.
[00:41:18.247 --> 00:41:22.311]  It turns out the health care reform is actually going to be the biggest tax increase in American history.
[00:41:22.311 --> 00:41:29.598]  Not only that, but because of taxes and mandates imposed on health insurance companies by the legislation, health insurance premiums are about to rise by at least 32 percent.
[00:41:32.133 --> 00:41:35.835]  So where will the average American family get the money to pay for these increases?
[00:41:47.563 --> 00:41:55.885]  Number 12, the reality is the Americans are increasingly becoming detached and disenchanted with the lack of leadership in both political parties.
[00:41:55.885 --> 00:42:02.067]  Approval ratings for leaders in both parties are extremely low, and anger at politicians is at an all-time high.
[00:42:02.067 --> 00:42:04.128]  How does the establishment respond?
[00:42:04.128 --> 00:42:05.208]  Militarizing the police.
[00:42:06.226 --> 00:42:10.328]  The Tea Party movement is just one symptom of the seething anger many Americans feel.
[00:42:10.328 --> 00:42:21.014]  While many Americans are gathering together at large protest rallies that demonstrate against both the policies of the government and others are expressing their displeasure on blogs and websites.
[00:42:21.014 --> 00:42:23.375]  And it goes on.
[00:42:23.375 --> 00:42:26.217]  And what does CNN and MSNBC and the White House do?
[00:42:26.217 --> 00:42:29.619]  They claim, oh, it's not about banks raping you or losing your jobs.
[00:42:30.981 --> 00:42:33.183]  It's not about the bank stealing 28 plus trillion.
[00:42:33.183 --> 00:42:35.805]  It's not about them announcing all these new taxes.
[00:42:35.805 --> 00:42:41.289]  No, you don't like black people just invoking race, cramming race in there.
[00:42:41.289 --> 00:42:52.077]  It's like you come up to your house and a black guy, a white guy, a Hispanic, an Asian, and a couple other white guys, and a Jewish guy,
[00:42:53.649 --> 00:43:01.990]  And a Chinese guy, and a whole bunch of people are robbing your house, and you walk over and you go, hey, I'm angry, you're robbing my house, and they say, shut up, racist!
[00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:09.832]  They just throw it out there, just throw it out there to further divide, to further conquer people.
[00:43:09.832 --> 00:43:22.174]  And I've seen countless blogs and YouTube videos and rappers and people coming out and talking about Cracker and Cracker's mad, totally buying into Obama's hype, when Obama is what?
[00:43:24.392 --> 00:43:26.273]  4.9% African.
[00:43:26.273 --> 00:43:31.837]  When Obama increased the abortion funding to get rid of more black people worldwide in Africa and the US.
[00:43:31.837 --> 00:43:34.700]  When 50 plus percent of blacks are never born.
[00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:37.361]  And then watch these fools sit there and buy into it.
[00:43:37.361 --> 00:43:47.009]  But I'll tell you who buys into it more is the white yuppies, the self-loathing, hating little control freaks that are into this religion of saying everyone's a racist but them.
[00:43:48.502 --> 00:43:49.363]  I could care less.
[00:43:49.363 --> 00:43:50.304]  I'm sick of it all.
[00:43:50.304 --> 00:43:57.169]  I almost want to come out and just say I'm a racist, even though I'm not, just to say I don't care what you think about me.
[00:43:57.169 --> 00:44:00.692]  I'm a racist because I don't want to kill 52% of black people.
[00:44:00.692 --> 00:44:09.120]  I'm a racist because I don't want mandatory minimum sentences designed to target inner-city people to put them in prison for one drug offense.
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:10.981]  I'm a racist.
[00:44:10.981 --> 00:44:13.303]  I'm a racist because I warn people not to take vaccines.
[00:44:14.684 --> 00:44:16.406]  Because that kills some black people.
[00:44:16.406 --> 00:44:18.087]  You know, I don't want them dying.
[00:44:18.087 --> 00:44:19.889]  I must be racist.
[00:44:19.889 --> 00:44:28.258]  It's just such a religious thing they beat us over the head with, with their political correctness and their Soviet control.
[00:44:28.258 --> 00:44:31.721]  Oh, it makes me sick!
[00:44:31.721 --> 00:44:32.722]  I have no guilt.
[00:44:32.722 --> 00:44:34.364]  None of your garbage works on me.
[00:44:34.364 --> 00:44:36.847]  Just get that absolutely through your heads.
[00:44:39.363 --> 00:44:42.305]  Meanwhile, the Democrats are caught attacking their own offices.
[00:44:42.305 --> 00:44:49.471]  The Democrats are caught, even in the Associated Press now, wanting to stage events with racist signs at the Tea Parties.
[00:44:49.471 --> 00:44:56.916]  The Black Congressional Caucus walks through crowds trying to start fights, then lies about what people said to them on video, caught red-handed.
[00:44:56.916 --> 00:44:58.037]  I'm sick of it!
[00:44:58.037 --> 00:44:59.718]  It's a political weapon!
[00:44:59.718 --> 00:45:03.201]  And white people need to stop being a bunch of guilty slobs.
[00:45:03.201 --> 00:45:04.302]  You were the majority.
[00:45:04.302 --> 00:45:06.523]  You had most of the wealth back when we had a middle class.
[00:45:07.364 --> 00:45:16.275]  And so you were taught to hate yourself, and when the government says, give up your rights, give up your guns, give up your sovereignty, or you're a racist, you roll over and do it!
[00:45:16.275 --> 00:45:18.958]  You better stop letting that propaganda work on you!
[00:45:18.958 --> 00:45:20.740]  And the good news is, it's not working anymore.
[00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:21.622]  And for black folks...
[00:45:23.851 --> 00:45:33.938]  Your black leaders, almost to a man and a woman, never talk about abortion and how most of the abortion clinics are in your area, or how the drugs are shipped into your area by the system.
[00:45:33.938 --> 00:45:46.628]  They are a bunch of... I've got the Rockefeller documents, the Margaret Singer documents, they're in Endgame, where they said in the 20s, 30s, and 40s, we're gonna hire a bunch of fake liberal blacks so we can set up a system to murder these animals.
[00:45:47.088 --> 00:45:48.248]  They call you animals.
[00:45:48.248 --> 00:45:49.789]  They call you weeds.
[00:45:49.789 --> 00:45:53.230]  They want to slaughter you and your family and you love them.
[00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:54.390]  It's pathetic!
[00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:56.571]  You make me want to throw up!
[00:45:56.571 --> 00:46:00.292]  You make me sick in all your righteousness.
[00:46:00.292 --> 00:46:04.933]  Growing up, having black people walk past me and go, look at the white devil.
[00:46:04.933 --> 00:46:10.335]  Yeah, well, there may be some white devils out there and there's some black devils working with them and I'm sure not it.
[00:46:10.335 --> 00:46:11.995]  You better find out who the devil is.
[00:46:11.995 --> 00:46:14.356]  You better find out real fast.
[00:46:14.356 --> 00:46:15.056]  I'm sick of it!
[00:46:18.615 --> 00:46:20.196]  Meanwhile, we have another U.N.
[00:46:20.196 --> 00:46:26.221]  document, not the one calling for a Green World Order or a world government, but another one, this out of the White House, leaked U.S.
[00:46:26.221 --> 00:46:30.784]  document calls for global regime to tackle climate change, global taxes.
[00:46:30.784 --> 00:46:31.584]  A confidential U.S.
[00:46:31.584 --> 00:46:37.689]  government document obtained by the London Guardian highlights the ongoing agenda to create a structure of global governance in the name of combating climate change.
[00:46:40.768 --> 00:46:42.669]  Now we have a new Club of Rome document.
[00:46:42.669 --> 00:46:48.114]  They're calling in the Euro and in England for arresting people.
[00:46:48.114 --> 00:46:50.816]  Arresting people.
[00:46:50.816 --> 00:46:54.238]  Oh, they've called for it in news articles, but now they're calling for it in government.
[00:46:54.238 --> 00:47:00.463]  Arresting you if you point out the Antarctic and Arctic ice shelves just got bigger.
[00:47:00.463 --> 00:47:02.104]  Record level in 30 years.
[00:47:02.104 --> 00:47:03.325]  You will be arrested.
[00:47:03.325 --> 00:47:06.708]  I mean, is there any doubt about the tyrannous we're facing?
[00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:14.132]  Is there any doubt about what is looking us in the eyes?
[00:47:14.132 --> 00:47:21.834]  Is there any doubt about the system that we are dealing with here?
[00:47:21.834 --> 00:47:26.635]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of documents a year.
[00:47:26.635 --> 00:47:32.536]  Editorials publicly written by the Financial Times of London and others calling for a global tyranny.
[00:47:32.536 --> 00:47:34.757]  The head of the Gaia movement
[00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:41.843]  Coming out last week and is calling for an end to freedom and a planetary tyranny.
[00:47:41.843 --> 00:47:42.925]  The good tyranny.
[00:47:49.844 --> 00:47:51.805]  And then I see propaganda like this.
[00:47:51.805 --> 00:47:53.166]  Nearly half of U.S.
[00:47:53.166 --> 00:47:56.208]  households escaped Fed income tax.
[00:47:56.208 --> 00:48:01.472]  I see this every day in different news permutations, different configurations.
[00:48:01.472 --> 00:48:03.854]  AP's written several of these articles.
[00:48:03.854 --> 00:48:04.794]  Nearly half of U.S.
[00:48:04.794 --> 00:48:08.137]  households escaped Fed income tax.
[00:48:08.137 --> 00:48:10.218]  No they don't.
[00:48:10.218 --> 00:48:12.700]  What do you think Social Security is?
[00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:15.482]  You're never going to get any of that money or you're going to get a tiny amount of it.
[00:48:17.267 --> 00:48:24.030]  Don't you know that they just don't hire more people or people get paid lower wages because they've got to match your Social Security?
[00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:26.151]  Instead of making $15 an hour, you make $10.
[00:48:26.151 --> 00:48:29.932]  Instead of making $16 an hour, you make $11.
[00:48:29.932 --> 00:48:33.234]  Instead of making $20 an hour, you make $15.
[00:48:33.234 --> 00:48:38.216]  Instead of making $30 an hour, you make $20.
[00:48:38.216 --> 00:48:40.837]  All this is passed on to you.
[00:48:40.837 --> 00:48:45.198]  And then there's all the other hundreds of fines and fees and taxes.
[00:48:45.198 --> 00:48:45.699]  And for the $40
[00:48:48.697 --> 00:48:54.141]  7% that don't visually see the taxes.
[00:48:54.141 --> 00:48:56.843]  You don't get most of those deductions.
[00:48:56.843 --> 00:48:59.726]  And it's all written in the fine print.
[00:48:59.726 --> 00:49:01.607]  Let me ask somebody working at McDonald's for $9 an hour.
[00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:06.071]  Uh, is about 20, 25% of your check out of that each time.
[00:49:06.071 --> 00:49:06.872]  You see that down there?
[00:49:06.872 --> 00:49:09.513]  The number you would have gotten versus what you're getting?
[00:49:09.513 --> 00:49:12.134]  You're being taxed by the private fellow reserve.
[00:49:12.134 --> 00:49:16.316]  Yes, you're paying, but they're putting this propaganda out there about rob thy brother.
[00:49:16.316 --> 00:49:19.417]  And oh my gosh, 47% are robbing the other 53.
[00:49:19.417 --> 00:49:25.740]  That money doesn't even go to you.
[00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:28.161]  You don't even get any of that.
[00:49:28.161 --> 00:49:30.122]  Other taxes pay for your welfare.
[00:49:31.101 --> 00:49:35.450]  It all goes to the private banks.
[00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:38.977]  Tax Day is a dreaded deadline for millions, but nearly half of U.S.
[00:49:38.977 --> 00:49:39.779]  households.
[00:49:39.779 --> 00:49:41.482]  It's simply somebody else's problem.
[00:49:43.894 --> 00:49:46.395]  About 47% will pay no income taxes as of 2009.
[00:49:46.395 --> 00:49:54.037]  Either their incomes were too low, or they qualified for enough credits, deductions, and exemptions to eliminate their liability.
[00:49:54.037 --> 00:49:59.799]  That's according to projections by the Tax Policy Center, a Washington research organization.
[00:49:59.799 --> 00:50:06.281]  Let's say you get paid $20,000 a year, and about 8,000 of that gets pulled out in taxes.
[00:50:06.281 --> 00:50:07.641]  That's the average.
[00:50:07.641 --> 00:50:11.582]  And then you get $1,000 back, like a monkey.
[00:50:11.582 --> 00:50:12.383]  You go out to your
[00:50:15.615 --> 00:50:21.176]  Mailbox, and you never paid attention to the money being taken out of your check, but you go out there and get a check!
[00:50:21.176 --> 00:50:23.037]  I got a check from the IRS!
[00:50:23.037 --> 00:50:24.577]  I like it!
[00:50:24.577 --> 00:50:27.038]  I like it!
[00:50:27.038 --> 00:50:29.819]  You like it, huh?
[00:50:29.819 --> 00:50:31.459]  You like that?
[00:50:31.459 --> 00:50:32.099]  You think that's cute?
[00:50:32.099 --> 00:50:35.540]  You think that's funny?
[00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:37.941]  Well, there's a reason you're poor.
[00:50:37.941 --> 00:50:39.701]  There's a reason there's no upward mobility.
[00:50:39.701 --> 00:50:41.242]  There's a reason things cost so much.
[00:50:42.475 --> 00:50:44.058]  It's the stinking offshore banks.
[00:50:44.058 --> 00:50:45.800]  It's the banking dictatorship.
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:53.412]  And you're gonna live just like people in Latin America or in the poor areas of Africa and Asia and Eastern Europe, okay?
[00:50:53.412 --> 00:50:56.136]  Those countries are all run by private banks.
[00:50:56.136 --> 00:50:56.857]  That's why they're poor!
[00:51:00.692 --> 00:51:03.876]  If you suffer from poor sleep, you've gotta try MyPillow!
[00:51:03.876 --> 00:51:07.641]  Introducing the most revolutionary, most comfortable, and coolest pillow ever!

[00:51:52.063 --> 00:51:52.323]  MyPillow.

[00:52:00.709 --> 00:52:03.010]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:03.010 --> 00:52:05.411]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:05.411 --> 00:52:08.633]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:08.633 --> 00:52:13.735]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:13.735 --> 00:52:17.917]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:18.237 --> 00:52:20.579]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:20.579 --> 00:52:23.141]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:23.141 --> 00:52:26.383]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:26.383 --> 00:52:33.989]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:34.329 --> 00:52:39.713]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:39.713 --> 00:52:42.035]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:42.035 --> 00:52:46.259]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:46.259 --> 00:52:47.340]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:48.681]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:48.681 --> 00:52:50.182]  Invisible Empire.

[00:52:59.921 --> 00:53:01.703]  Normal blood pressure, naturally.
[00:53:01.703 --> 00:53:03.044]  How would that make you feel?
[00:53:03.044 --> 00:53:04.745]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[00:53:04.745 --> 00:53:07.307]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[00:53:07.307 --> 00:53:14.853]  Then my real health began going downhill, and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[00:53:14.853 --> 00:53:16.354]  I was a mess, pretty much.
[00:53:16.354 --> 00:53:19.097]  Don reports dramatic improvements with heart and body extract.
[00:53:19.097 --> 00:53:24.421]  I started taking heart and body extract, and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better.
[00:53:24.421 --> 00:53:29.445]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[00:53:29.645 --> 00:53:34.748]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.

[00:53:44.453 --> 00:53:47.235]  Folks, I did not expect this at all.
[00:53:47.235 --> 00:53:51.957]  By the 7th, 8th, and 9th day, I saw dramatic improvements from taking Heart and Body Extract.
[00:53:51.957 --> 00:53:56.520]  Details at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[00:54:00.857 --> 00:54:01.360]  I'm good.
[00:54:15.538 --> 00:54:18.200]  Johnny B. Goode!
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:22.043]  But he can play a guitar like he was ringing a bell!
[00:54:37.148 --> 00:54:38.229]  We are back live.
[00:54:38.229 --> 00:54:39.151]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:54:39.151 --> 00:54:41.594]  Two hours with Gerald Solente coming up.
[00:54:41.594 --> 00:54:45.719]  We'll also check in with Tax-Free Day, April 15th.
[00:54:45.719 --> 00:54:47.922]  Movement getting a lot of traction around the country.
[00:54:47.922 --> 00:54:49.223]  We're very honored to support it.
[00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:53.741]  I'm going to open the phones up in the first 30 minutes of the next hour.
[00:54:53.741 --> 00:54:55.502]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:54:55.502 --> 00:55:09.107]  I want to recap the situation with Obama hyping nuclear terrorist attacks, atomic terrorist attacks inside the United States, and we're seeing lots of hype.
[00:55:09.727 --> 00:55:12.969]  In the last year, in a preparatory phase for this.
[00:55:12.969 --> 00:55:16.271]  Is it just a psychological act of terrorism by the globalists?
[00:55:16.271 --> 00:55:19.594]  As we know, the Homeland Security admits they've done, illegally.
[00:55:19.594 --> 00:55:22.816]  Or are they preparing us for a real attack?
[00:55:22.816 --> 00:55:33.083]  I've got my ears up, I've got my sixth sense tingling here, saying, danger, Will Robinson, danger.
[00:55:33.083 --> 00:55:35.945]  Continuing with the tax situation.
[00:55:38.223 --> 00:55:58.811]  The big private central bank holders that hold stock in the Federal Reserve are now a year and a half plus into the trillions they've stolen that they promised were to unlock mortgage loans and they've actually reduced the amount of mortgage loans since then and are not refinancing with people or they're doing it in even worse terms than people previously had.
[00:55:58.811 --> 00:56:00.031]  This is out of the Wall Street Journal.
[00:56:00.031 --> 00:56:02.172]  Banks rebel against push to redo loans.
[00:56:03.126 --> 00:56:08.888]  And it continues, Bloomberg, Feds shouldn't reveal loans banks vowed to tell High Court.
[00:56:08.888 --> 00:56:27.435]  Well, we've got the memos and the emails from Geithner when he was New York Fed Chairman, that's the real office that runs it, before he was Treasury Secretary, working with his former boss, who was the Treasury Secretary, Paulson, telling the banks, do not tell the public or Congress where the money is going.
[00:56:27.435 --> 00:56:29.416]  And we've all got them in testimony.
[00:56:29.416 --> 00:56:31.517]  We've got this in Obama deception and fall of the Republic.
[00:56:32.793 --> 00:56:35.513]  You've all seen them on the news saying, we won't tell you where the money went.
[00:56:35.513 --> 00:56:39.894]  And then when it comes out and it's illegal for them to do that, they say, we never told anybody not to say where it went.
[00:56:39.894 --> 00:56:41.775]  Then Congress says, so where did it went?
[00:56:41.775 --> 00:56:42.215]  Where'd it go?
[00:56:42.215 --> 00:56:42.895]  I'm not going to tell you.
[00:56:42.895 --> 00:56:46.155]  I mean, it's just, we need world government.
[00:56:46.155 --> 00:56:47.296]  Well, I don't want world government.
[00:56:47.296 --> 00:56:49.756]  Shut up, nut, it doesn't exist.
[00:56:49.756 --> 00:56:51.276]  Tell us where the money went.
[00:56:51.276 --> 00:56:52.296]  No.
[00:56:52.296 --> 00:56:56.977]  Well, we have these memos where you told people illegally to hide this from the feds.
[00:56:56.977 --> 00:56:57.657]  I didn't do that.
[00:56:57.657 --> 00:56:59.858]  Okay, well, where's the money?
[00:56:59.858 --> 00:57:00.578]  I'm not going to tell you.
[00:57:02.009 --> 00:57:17.277]  I mean, it's just, they couldn't get away with this if the public wasn't just dumbed down, but just doesn't know how things work, isn't interested, and wonders why you're losing your job, or getting your pay cut, or why they're taking your pension fund, or taking part of your pension fund.
[00:57:17.277 --> 00:57:22.140]  You're wondering why all this is happening, but you don't care to actually get the facts and stop it.
[00:57:23.618 --> 00:57:29.303]  I know our listeners do, but a lot of people out there, they're helpless, and that's why the globalists are doing this.
[00:57:29.303 --> 00:57:31.786]  They look at us and they say, these people are chumps.
[00:57:31.786 --> 00:57:37.010]  They're just like people in the third world, who we've got a police state over, let's rob them.
[00:57:37.010 --> 00:57:38.572]  How bad do we rob them?
[00:57:38.572 --> 00:57:41.214]  We rob them something fierce.
[00:57:41.214 --> 00:57:42.335]  We never stop.
[00:57:42.335 --> 00:57:43.837]  We don't give them quarter.
[00:57:43.837 --> 00:57:45.458]  We don't back off.
[00:57:45.458 --> 00:57:48.541]  We go all the way.
[00:57:48.541 --> 00:57:49.262]  We nail them.
[00:57:54.164 --> 00:58:03.746]  And so that's the situation that we face as a society.
[00:58:03.746 --> 00:58:06.887]  Meanwhile, Neil Armstrong, Obama hurting space effort.
[00:58:06.887 --> 00:58:13.988]  Former astronaut Neil Armstrong has issued a strongly worded rebuke of President Barack Obama criticizing the President for proposed revisions to the U.S.
[00:58:13.988 --> 00:58:15.228]  space program.
[00:58:15.228 --> 00:58:18.229]  Armstrong, along with astronauts James Lovell and Eugene
[00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:26.574]  Cernan called the proposal devastating in a letter obtained by NBC News.
[00:58:26.574 --> 00:58:28.976]  Yeah, what, 10 billion bucks to the space program?
[00:58:28.976 --> 00:58:30.437]  Obama wants to cut it by more than half?
[00:58:30.437 --> 00:58:32.478]  I mean, that's chicken feed.
[00:58:32.478 --> 00:58:36.941]  But again, NASA is just the fake space program.
[00:58:36.941 --> 00:58:42.505]  The real space program is highly classified.

[01:00:17.569 --> 01:00:21.633]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:34.088 --> 01:00:36.791]  We are now into our number two.
[01:00:36.791 --> 01:00:45.700]  Gerald Salente joins us for a two-hour interview to take your phone calls and break down trends and where he sees the world going in the third and fourth hour today.
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:50.225]  We've got the government hyping nuclear terrorism as a pretext to set up a larger police state.
[01:00:50.225 --> 01:00:53.668]  The UN and the White House openly calling for world government again.
[01:00:54.810 --> 01:00:57.332]  A Green World Order to control our lives.
[01:00:57.332 --> 01:01:00.676]  Tax Day is tomorrow.
[01:01:00.676 --> 01:01:06.902]  High-level members of the Polish government are basically saying the Russians killed those people in Saturday's plane crash.
[01:01:06.902 --> 01:01:08.844]  That is all coming up today.
[01:01:08.844 --> 01:01:13.589]  And I want to go to your phone calls now.
[01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:15.732]  Rick in Georgia, you're on the air.
[01:01:16.894 --> 01:01:25.316]  Hi Alex, I've been trying to call for a couple weeks now because I heard you mention to your listeners about the type of care veterans receive.
[01:01:25.316 --> 01:01:38.480]  And as a disabled veteran who receives care in the VA hospitals and also has done work study in different positions in there, I thought I'd give your listeners a real clear picture of what government-run healthcare looks like.
[01:01:40.181 --> 01:02:01.935]  For 16 years since I took a 35-foot fall in the army and hurt my back, I've been trying to get fixed, done everything medically that the VA told me to do, and now that there's a technology called spinal decompression that could actually help me, and it exists in two VA hospitals, and there's a law that says
[01:02:02.734 --> 01:02:09.852]  That they have to, if one VA has one and another one doesn't, they have to get the veteran to a facility that does.
[01:02:12.742 --> 01:02:18.984]  I am still being told no for the past three years I've been fighting this battle with the VA.
[01:02:18.984 --> 01:02:25.887]  They are spending more money to tell me no than the entire cost of what I asked for in the first place.
[01:02:25.887 --> 01:02:28.828]  Well that's their prime directive is to deny the care.
[01:02:28.828 --> 01:02:35.031]  They've got a lot of doctors from other nations who really aren't even true doctors according to the different experts we've interviewed.
[01:02:36.071 --> 01:02:41.495]  And the model for government health care and comparative care is the VA.
[01:02:41.495 --> 01:02:49.962]  Where say you have a bad knee, they just give you cortisone shots that help for a while but then disintegrate your body after just a few years.
[01:02:49.962 --> 01:02:52.244]  And that's the model.
[01:02:52.244 --> 01:02:52.784]  Exactly.
[01:02:52.784 --> 01:02:59.970]  They've had me on Percocet and muscle relaxers for over seven years now.
[01:03:02.961 --> 01:03:04.762]  Everything I do, they do.
[01:03:04.762 --> 01:03:06.343]  Well, you know why though?
[01:03:06.343 --> 01:03:12.266]  Because it's all engineered to not have it go to a real doctor or a medical facility.
[01:03:12.266 --> 01:03:15.969]  They're shifting medicine over to drugs.
[01:03:15.969 --> 01:03:16.649]  Exactly.
[01:03:16.649 --> 01:03:22.092]  They don't care about making me better at all in any way, shape, or form.
[01:03:22.092 --> 01:03:27.875]  I've confronted them with their own regulations that they're violating and they still keep telling me no.
[01:03:27.875 --> 01:03:29.256]  But I don't stop.
[01:03:29.256 --> 01:03:32.018]  I keep going higher and higher and higher and higher because
[01:03:32.578 --> 01:03:34.839]  That is all we can do.
[01:03:34.839 --> 01:03:37.101]  Not just as Americans, but as human beings.
[01:03:37.101 --> 01:03:39.302]  That's all you can do in life.
[01:03:39.302 --> 01:03:42.704]  If you get knocked down, you've got two choices.
[01:03:42.704 --> 01:03:45.985]  Stay there on the ground, or get back up and try again.
[01:03:45.985 --> 01:03:58.912]  Well, I commend you, Rick, and I would just add, England, in its own government statistics, has the lowest survivability of heart attacks, cancer, the list goes on and on, because they have government healthcare.
[01:03:58.912 --> 01:04:01.054]  People wait a month sometimes
[01:04:02.114 --> 01:04:07.901]  On a gurney, this was just last week, and die on the gurney, getting no care.
[01:04:07.901 --> 01:04:11.685]  They wait on average 18 months for key cancer surgeries.
[01:04:11.685 --> 01:04:13.027]  This is the new America.
[01:04:13.877 --> 01:04:17.860]  Oh, and I just wanted to add one more thing, Alex, too, for all those veterans out there.
[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:29.730]  When the VA switched over to electronic record-keeping, they told the veterans that the paperwork that had existed prior to that was going to be put into storage.
[01:04:29.730 --> 01:04:30.871]  That is not true.
[01:04:30.871 --> 01:04:34.414]  They shredded everybody's medical records and threw them away.
[01:04:34.414 --> 01:04:36.035]  Of course!
[01:04:36.035 --> 01:04:40.499]  I know because I did that as a work study during college, before you woke me up.
[01:04:41.039 --> 01:04:44.742]  I didn't understand what I was taking part in, but that's what they have done.
[01:04:44.742 --> 01:04:49.066]  They've shredded all the medical records, and they're gone forever.
[01:04:49.066 --> 01:04:58.954]  You pay taxes, you pay taxes, and you don't get NASA, you don't get a sheriff's department, you don't get roads, all you get is the Federal Reserve taking everything you got.
[01:05:00.663 --> 01:05:03.044]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:05:03.044 --> 01:05:05.365]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:05:05.365 --> 01:05:08.566]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:05:08.566 --> 01:05:13.668]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:05:13.668 --> 01:05:18.189]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:05:18.189 --> 01:05:20.650]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:23.071]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:05:23.071 --> 01:05:25.932]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:05:26.332 --> 01:05:34.281]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:05:34.281 --> 01:05:39.668]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:05:39.668 --> 01:05:41.990]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:45.935]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:05:46.195 --> 01:05:47.277]  And I got news for you.
[01:05:47.277 --> 01:05:48.598]  You're everyone else.
[01:05:48.598 --> 01:05:50.121]  Invisible Empire.

[01:06:00.592 --> 01:06:01.893]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:06:01.893 --> 01:06:07.476]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:06:07.476 --> 01:06:12.499]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:06:12.499 --> 01:06:18.082]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:06:18.082 --> 01:06:23.305]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:06:23.305 --> 01:06:25.186]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.

[01:06:34.311 --> 01:06:38.214]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[01:06:44.758 --> 01:06:44.998]  Remember,
[01:06:53.343 --> 01:06:57.271]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:06:57.271 --> 01:06:59.656]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:07:01.215 --> 01:07:04.097]  ...away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.

[01:07:51.511 --> 01:07:52.832]  Be a part of the revolution today.
[01:07:52.832 --> 01:07:54.233]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:54.233 --> 01:07:55.473]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:19.832 --> 01:08:29.696]  Last week we had Katherine Austin Fitz on, who was the number two person at a major federal agency, and basically ran HUD.
[01:08:29.696 --> 01:08:44.023]  And she talked about even in the 90s, she met with top actuary specialists and said, my conclusion is they're preparing to take the entire social safety net and basically kill people.
[01:08:45.302 --> 01:08:48.205]  And that everything's going to go to debt to banks.
[01:08:48.205 --> 01:08:52.369]  And the people she met with said that is our independent analysis as well.
[01:08:52.369 --> 01:08:56.994]  So this was all decided on over a decade ago.
[01:08:56.994 --> 01:09:00.017]  Put into function over a decade ago.
[01:09:00.017 --> 01:09:05.063]  And you will pay nothing but higher and higher taxes and the so-called healthcare you get will be drugs.
[01:09:08.152 --> 01:09:12.094]  And old people will be restricted in what they can have access to even more than others.
[01:09:12.094 --> 01:09:15.875]  This is the eugenicist socialist model.
[01:09:15.875 --> 01:09:19.996]  And all the profits will swell the banks that own the insurance companies.
[01:09:19.996 --> 01:09:22.918]  That's why they lobbied for it.
[01:09:22.918 --> 01:09:29.560]  And it allows government to decide what care you're going to get and shape the future of medicine.
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:36.723]  And that's because with genetic engineering and stem cell research and all the new types of surgery they have that are less invasive,
[01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:39.220]  I don't
[01:09:53.686 --> 01:09:56.587]  That cheap, effective health care for you to get.
[01:09:56.587 --> 01:10:01.489]  Instead, they love the announcement that they're short 15,000 doctors.
[01:10:01.489 --> 01:10:04.530]  They love the announcement there's big lines for health care.
[01:10:04.530 --> 01:10:09.612]  They love the announcement that people are confused not getting free health care, asking where it is.
[01:10:09.612 --> 01:10:11.773]  They love the state's going bankrupt.
[01:10:11.773 --> 01:10:13.913]  It's just so wonderful.
[01:10:13.913 --> 01:10:15.274]  They're wreckers.
[01:10:15.274 --> 01:10:20.436]  And I've broken down this historical parallel or analogy.
[01:10:21.676 --> 01:10:26.638]  Or case point many times, but I want to do it again briefly before I go back to your calls.
[01:10:26.638 --> 01:10:47.285]  Every coastal society, from Aboriginal tribes on the coast of Australia, to the Polynesians in the Pacific, to the Vikings,
[01:10:48.928 --> 01:11:02.011]  In northern and western Europe, to the British, off of their southern coast, have called, have had what are called wreckers.
[01:11:02.011 --> 01:11:02.812]  Wreckers.
[01:11:02.812 --> 01:11:03.712]  Ship wreckers.
[01:11:03.712 --> 01:11:09.633]  In fact, guys, Google the definition of ship wreckers.
[01:11:09.633 --> 01:11:15.315]  One definition, more modern, will be those that decommission and dismantle them, but I want the old definition.
[01:11:16.474 --> 01:11:39.048]  And just 200 years ago, until it became a big issue in London, and then they went and supposedly banned it on the southern, western, eastern, and northern coast of England, there were towns whose main source of income was using British salvage law, and they would put up fake lighthouses.
[01:11:39.048 --> 01:11:40.709]  They would only ignite them in bad weather.
[01:11:43.403 --> 01:12:02.899]  And when merchant ships were going through the English Channel and moving down south towards Spain or towards the Mediterranean or towards Africa, they would go and put up fake lighthouses in bad weather to bring ships in to run them up on the rocks.
[01:12:02.899 --> 01:12:09.925]  And a lot of times people would drown and die, but then they would go out in ships the next day and they would salvage the hold and sell it.
[01:12:11.581 --> 01:12:12.762]  And that's what globalists do.
[01:12:12.762 --> 01:12:20.286]  First, they get control of your society, get you dependent, get you on welfare, drive up the debt of the local government, state government, federal.
[01:12:20.286 --> 01:12:29.032]  Then they have your paid-off government sign treaties with the international bodies, who then come in and loan you even more fiat made-up money backed up by your taxpayers.
[01:12:29.032 --> 01:12:39.478]  And then once the people become debtor slaves, they then remove all the chicken feed that they use to get you dependent, and basically finish the transfer towards total slavery.
[01:12:42.461 --> 01:12:45.184]  So now they're just in the pure wrecking phase.
[01:12:45.184 --> 01:12:48.467]  Wrecking Main Street, wrecking industry, wrecking society.
[01:12:48.467 --> 01:12:52.471]  Hundreds of laws, tax incentives to move offshore.
[01:12:52.471 --> 01:12:56.876]  New laws, new environmental regulations to shut down whatever industry is hanging on.
[01:12:56.876 --> 01:13:02.302]  No laws in over 100 third world countries as what's left of the industry flees.
[01:13:04.921 --> 01:13:22.572]  And then once they've got you fully under their control, down the road, with whoever's left with one-child policies and regulations and eugenics and poison vaccines and GMO, then there may be some industry for you if you've been handpicked to be part of that guild, or if you're part of the paramilitary force.
[01:13:22.572 --> 01:13:25.314]  There will be no police to respond to crime.
[01:13:25.314 --> 01:13:29.697]  There will be no police to respond to actual murder and mayhem and illegal aliens.
[01:13:30.947 --> 01:13:41.233]  There will only be police to take your children, to back up the CPS, to take your farm, your ranch, your house, your business.
[01:13:41.233 --> 01:13:45.296]  They will purely, 100% be parasitic.
[01:13:45.296 --> 01:13:47.657]  And that's now the conversion all over the country.
[01:13:47.657 --> 01:13:56.383]  They're laying off upwards of half the police in cities and counties, in some cases even more, and saying, sorry, we've got 49 cops left in this Ohio County.
[01:13:58.035 --> 01:14:03.899]  But only three a day, one per shift, will be to respond to calls.
[01:14:03.899 --> 01:14:07.080]  Everyone else is to help the CPS.
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:13.905]  Everyone else is to go and arrest you for warrants if you haven't paid your parking tickets.
[01:14:13.905 --> 01:14:19.128]  Everything is there to squeeze and squeeze and squeeze.
[01:14:19.128 --> 01:14:22.410]  And when they take the cops' pension funds, they'll say, oh, at least I still got a job.
[01:14:23.624 --> 01:14:29.025]  Yeah, I don't like it the government did it, but at least I got a badge and a gun, or at least I'm formally a cop.
[01:14:29.025 --> 01:14:39.587]  You know, I'm retired, at least I get to go down to the bar on Saturday and, you know, I get a few favors if I need it.
[01:14:39.587 --> 01:14:44.568]  We're waking up homeless on the continent our forefathers conquered.
[01:14:44.568 --> 01:14:45.949]  There are some rays of hope.
[01:14:45.949 --> 01:14:47.029]  The people are waking up to this.
[01:14:48.956 --> 01:14:53.138]  The states are moving to nullify the government takeover of health care that the fight's on.
[01:14:53.138 --> 01:14:56.460]  And so Obama says, well, terrorists may just nuke a city.
[01:14:56.460 --> 01:15:00.303]  That'll give me the excuse to really take over your life and pose as your savior.
[01:15:00.303 --> 01:15:02.684]  I'll just launch a new war.
[01:15:02.684 --> 01:15:04.845]  We'll just scare everybody about the flu.
[01:15:04.845 --> 01:15:06.626]  We'll just release some more anthrax.
[01:15:06.626 --> 01:15:10.628]  We'll just stage some terror attacks and blame it on gun owners and veterans.
[01:15:10.628 --> 01:15:12.570]  We'll just use homeland security on you.
[01:15:12.570 --> 01:15:14.491]  That's what it was set up for, good old boys.
[01:15:15.834 --> 01:15:24.198]  We played you like a fiddle, telling you we were taking everybody's rights to hurt some brown people.
[01:15:24.198 --> 01:15:26.940]  Arizona clears strict immigration bill.
[01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:30.222]  Meanwhile, the feds are trying to prosecute Arpaio.
[01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:42.928]  In the Phoenix, in the county, they're trying to prosecute other sheriffs that will arrest drunk driving illegals, illegals with no ID, just like they treat citizens.
[01:15:42.928 --> 01:15:48.911]  The feds are in there trying to block this and got Justice Department investigations going on.
[01:15:48.911 --> 01:15:57.337]  Arizona lawmakers on Tuesday passed one of the toughest pieces of immigration enforcement legislation in the country, which would make it a violation of state law to be in the U.S.
[01:15:57.337 --> 01:15:58.658]  without proper documentation.
[01:15:59.497 --> 01:16:05.600]  It would also grant police the power to stop and verify the immigration status of anyone they suspect of being illegal.
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:07.441]  And the feds are saying that's discriminatory.
[01:16:07.441 --> 01:16:18.766]  Yeah, the police in Arizona have random checkpoints taking our blood, and the feds, Arizona was the first to do it for more than 11 years, the feds are backing and pushing that.
[01:16:18.766 --> 01:16:27.851]  But if you see a truckload of people jumping on another truck at a day labor site who are obviously illegals, total probable cause, you can't go talk to them.
[01:16:29.502 --> 01:16:37.290]  The bill would grant police the power to stop and verify the immigration status of anyone they suspect of being illegal.
[01:16:37.290 --> 01:16:42.114]  That's one of the few powers that the police actually have under the Constitution, I would add, under state and federal.
[01:16:42.114 --> 01:16:46.518]  The bill... See, they do everything that's unconstitutional and nothing that's constitutional.
[01:16:47.557 --> 01:16:52.058]  The bill could still face a veto from Arizona Governor Jan Brewer.
[01:16:52.058 --> 01:16:56.879]  A spokeswoman for Brewer said she had not publicly committed and commented on the bill.
[01:16:56.879 --> 01:16:57.079]  Ms.
[01:16:57.079 --> 01:17:00.580]  Brewer, a Republican, has argued for stringent immigration laws.
[01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:08.782]  Under the measure passed Tuesday by Arizona's lower house, after being passed earlier in the Senate, foreign nationals are required to carry proof of legal residency.
[01:17:08.782 --> 01:17:10.362]  So what are the feds doing?
[01:17:10.362 --> 01:17:14.463]  They're racing in the last five years with the national ID card, the Real ID Act.
[01:17:15.123 --> 01:17:16.664]  They're calling an immigration reform.
[01:17:16.664 --> 01:17:19.506]  It just gives the illegals the ID card.
[01:17:19.506 --> 01:17:20.846]  All of them will be given it.
[01:17:20.846 --> 01:17:25.089]  And so, yeah, that ends illegal immigration because none of it's illegal.
[01:17:25.089 --> 01:17:29.891]  But then citizens have to have it under federal control to have a job.
[01:17:29.891 --> 01:17:36.375]  And the feds have said if you're not in good graces with them, or haven't paid some taxes, your employer will be told to fire you!
[01:17:36.375 --> 01:17:38.937]  And you'll be refused unemployment benefits.
[01:17:38.937 --> 01:17:41.198]  See, you will neither buy nor sell without the mark.
[01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:45.721]  And even if you don't believe in the Bible, hey, whatever.
[01:17:45.721 --> 01:17:47.362]  The point is, this is going on right now.
[01:17:47.362 --> 01:17:50.083]  You can't deny this.
[01:17:50.083 --> 01:17:51.503]  Let's go to Charlie in New York.
[01:17:51.503 --> 01:17:53.584]  Charlie, you're on the air.
[01:17:53.584 --> 01:17:54.264]  Hi, Alex.
[01:17:54.264 --> 01:17:55.625]  First-time caller here.
[01:17:55.625 --> 01:18:00.007]  First, I want to say, God bless you, your crew, and all your families.
[01:18:00.007 --> 01:18:01.167]  Thank you.
[01:18:01.167 --> 01:18:06.170]  This message is for Christians who believe that Christ is coming back any day now.
[01:18:06.170 --> 01:18:09.011]  And they're standing down and waiting.
[01:18:09.011 --> 01:18:11.252]  And I just want to read something out of Luke 12.
[01:18:12.606 --> 01:18:18.148]  And it says, um, let your girdle be fastened on your loins and your lamps lighted.
[01:18:18.148 --> 01:18:27.572]  And be like men who expect their master when he will return from the wedding house, so that when he comes and knocks, they will immediately open the door for him.
[01:18:27.572 --> 01:18:31.094]  Blessed are those servants whom their master, when he comes, finds awake.
[01:18:31.716 --> 01:18:37.621]  Truly I say to you that he will gird himself and make them sit down and come in and serve them.
[01:18:37.621 --> 01:18:42.205]  If he should come in the second or third watch and find himself blessed are those servants.
[01:18:42.205 --> 01:18:51.873]  But know this, that if the master of the house knew him, what watch the thief would come, he would have kept awake and not allowed his house be plundered.
[01:18:51.873 --> 01:18:57.078]  Therefore, you also be ready for the Son of Man will come in that very hour which you do not expect.
[01:18:58.137 --> 01:19:12.621]  Yeah, the Bible in the Old Testament and the New Testament, from end to end, is rebuking Israel and other nations that are wicked and sending them into captivity, letting them being enslaved.
[01:19:12.621 --> 01:19:14.302]  And it's all about standing up.
[01:19:14.302 --> 01:19:16.643]  You know, who will stand up against the wicked one?
[01:19:16.643 --> 01:19:18.263]  If you don't, the blood is on your hands.
[01:19:18.263 --> 01:19:20.604]  I know that's basically a verse.
[01:19:20.604 --> 01:19:24.085]  In fact, Google Bible verse, who will stand up against the wicked one?
[01:19:25.555 --> 01:19:36.443]  It is your job, but these government-financed, most of them are actually paid by the government, that's now been declassified for four years, to tell their flocks to lay down, to stand down.
[01:19:36.443 --> 01:19:43.568]  Even if you're not a Christian, more than half this nation identifies themselves as Christians, but these people really aren't Christians, and so it's important
[01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:53.365]  Explain to Christians that going to church and sucking your thumb and dressing up fancy and going, you know, to the cafeteria after church.
[01:19:53.365 --> 01:19:57.208]  If you're not out there fighting evil and fighting the New World Order, you might as well join Satan.
[01:20:01.656 --> 01:20:06.280]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name of water filtration.

[01:21:00.914 --> 01:21:10.963]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[01:21:10.963 --> 01:21:17.408]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[01:21:17.408 --> 01:21:26.256]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[01:21:26.616 --> 01:21:35.800]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:40.401]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world-reserved currency.
[01:21:40.401 --> 01:21:42.222]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[01:24:15.874 --> 01:24:21.597]  Who stands up for me against evildoers?
[01:24:21.597 --> 01:24:27.661]  And it goes on, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:33.945 --> 01:24:39.809]  And it continues, can wicked rulers be allied with you, those who frame injustice by statute?
[01:24:39.809 --> 01:24:44.792]  This is out of Psalms.
[01:24:44.792 --> 01:24:51.497]  And it tells you to stand up against their wickedness.
[01:24:51.497 --> 01:24:57.461]  He will bring back on them their iniquity and wipe them out for their wickedness.
[01:25:01.072 --> 01:25:06.997]  The band together against the life of the righteous and condemn the innocent to death.
[01:25:06.997 --> 01:25:08.298]  What do these evil governments do?
[01:25:08.298 --> 01:25:10.359]  They frame innocent people.
[01:25:10.359 --> 01:25:12.120]  They set innocent people up.
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:18.165]  Who will stand up against them?
[01:25:18.165 --> 01:25:21.007]  Who?

[01:25:29.253 --> 01:25:29.694]  Pretty good, sir.
[01:25:32.295 --> 01:25:34.756]  There's a couple of points I'd like to make.
[01:25:34.756 --> 01:25:36.757]  Yeah, you're having a phone problem.

[01:25:41.519 --> 01:25:42.699]  It's too bad of a phone.
[01:25:42.699 --> 01:25:44.840]  Adam in Canada, you're on the air.
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:47.021]  Yeah, first-time caller, long-time listener.
[01:25:47.021 --> 01:25:48.002]  How are you doing?
[01:25:48.002 --> 01:25:48.362]  Good, sir.
[01:25:48.362 --> 01:25:49.962]  Go ahead.
[01:25:49.962 --> 01:25:53.024]  I'm actually glad that you asked that question about Psalms.
[01:25:53.024 --> 01:25:56.865]  You already answered it, but it was Psalm 94, 16.
[01:25:56.865 --> 01:25:58.426]  Who will rise up for me against the wicked?
[01:25:59.133 --> 01:26:00.454]  And you know what happens when you do that?
[01:26:00.454 --> 01:26:01.694]  You get a boot to the face.
[01:26:01.694 --> 01:26:04.916]  And it's not just in America, it's here in Canada too.
[01:26:04.916 --> 01:26:13.181]  I watched your video about these truthers in Austin, Texas and the cops coming to shut them down.
[01:26:13.181 --> 01:26:15.422]  And it kind of prompted me to call you.
[01:26:15.422 --> 01:26:19.164]  Right now I'm wearing my hospital bracelet still.
[01:26:19.164 --> 01:26:25.167]  Because I stood up to some police officers out of town on Saturday night.
[01:26:25.167 --> 01:26:28.409]  And they caught my eye, or I caught their eye the wrong way.
[01:26:29.424 --> 01:26:50.368]  And, uh, long story short, I got my rear end handed to me by, uh, ten officers here, and, uh, they arrested me, falsely accused me of, uh, being intoxicated in public, and I don't drink, but I'm fighting a $50 fine, and, uh, our lawyers are telling us to, uh, just back down because you can't win.
[01:26:50.368 --> 01:26:57.789]  So, I went and got x-rays because I thought they broke my face and my, uh, my left arm, and I'm still kind of following through.
[01:26:57.789 --> 01:26:59.049]  I have the ticket here, and
[01:26:59.747 --> 01:27:04.110]  And all that, so I just figured I'd say to you that it's not just America, it's Canada now, too.
[01:27:04.110 --> 01:27:04.971]  Oh, I know.
[01:27:04.971 --> 01:27:20.242]  Well, have you seen the University of Maryland footage of where these college kids are just walking along and it's clear video and the cops come up and beat them half to death and then charge them with assaulting the cops?
[01:27:20.242 --> 01:27:20.582]  Now...
[01:27:21.463 --> 01:27:26.987]  The feds are coming in because the video got released showing the frame up and the cops are going to go to jail.
[01:27:26.987 --> 01:27:31.090]  But who gets the feds in trouble for burning down Waco and killing those kids?
[01:27:31.090 --> 01:27:36.014]  See, that's the issue is they've trained the cops to do this and frame people.
[01:27:36.014 --> 01:27:39.397]  But now all this video is coming out exposing them.
[01:27:39.397 --> 01:27:44.921]  So they're trying to pass state and federal laws to arrest anyone that videotapes the police.
[01:27:45.481 --> 01:27:59.851]  Because basically anybody who's got a cell phone now has a pretty good quality video camera and it's just showing people that a large percentage of police, a large, and it's particular departments get even worse.
[01:27:59.851 --> 01:28:04.855]  It tends to run through departments because the leadership are just framing people everywhere.
[01:28:04.855 --> 01:28:06.096]  And I want to explain something.
[01:28:06.616 --> 01:28:08.737]  I've had Feds try to frame me.
[01:28:08.737 --> 01:28:11.318]  I've had cops try to frame me.
[01:28:11.318 --> 01:28:13.680]  I've seen Luke Radowsky with them trying to frame them.
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:19.142]  I've seen them try to frame my camera crew at the G20 for terrorism.
[01:28:19.142 --> 01:28:21.263]  I mean, the cops are so corrupt in New York.
[01:28:21.263 --> 01:28:26.606]  They walk up with video cameras rolling and say, we are going to frame you as terrorists.
[01:28:26.606 --> 01:28:28.007]  That's in Truth Rising.
[01:28:28.007 --> 01:28:29.427]  On video.
[01:28:29.427 --> 01:28:31.789]  They knew they had cameras and didn't even care.
[01:28:32.709 --> 01:28:40.516]  I mean, think of the magnitude of evil that those cops have been told you can even frame people on video.
[01:28:40.516 --> 01:28:45.301]  I mean, folks, there's a Supreme Court case coming up, and it looks like it's going to go well.
[01:28:45.301 --> 01:28:49.785]  We're talking to folks involved, and I'm going to play some audio and video of this coming up.
[01:28:50.950 --> 01:28:57.154]  That we might just go live at PrisonPlanet.tv in the last segment of this hour so people can actually see this.
[01:28:57.154 --> 01:29:01.057]  But the article is epic corruption and the whistleblower.
[01:29:01.057 --> 01:29:05.960]  But before I get to that, just finishing up, so they came over and told you you were drunk and that's why they beat you up?
[01:29:07.212 --> 01:29:24.249]  Uh, no, they caught, the officer was driving by and caught my eye and gave me the kind of look that I'm sure you're used to, that arrogant pompous look, and I kind of just, as a gut reaction, gave it back to him, and he just stopped the cruiser.
[01:29:24.249 --> 01:29:25.971]  Wait a minute, you mean a slave?
[01:29:26.551 --> 01:29:28.953]  Kind of let his eyes glare back at a God?
[01:29:28.953 --> 01:29:32.095]  This is the Soviet Union, pal.
[01:29:32.095 --> 01:29:33.776]  You don't look at a God like that.
[01:29:33.776 --> 01:29:36.357]  But they showed you their God, right?
[01:29:36.357 --> 01:29:37.578]  Calling them Nazis.
[01:29:37.578 --> 01:29:40.179]  I said, you guys are the coke and heroin dealers here.
[01:29:40.179 --> 01:29:43.461]  Probably doing child molestation.
[01:29:43.461 --> 01:29:44.722]  And they really didn't like that.
[01:29:44.722 --> 01:29:46.803]  They're beating me on the ground.
[01:29:46.803 --> 01:29:50.866]  I took pictures and I sent the pictures to you, but I don't know who to send them to.
[01:29:51.366 --> 01:29:55.315]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.315 --> 01:29:58.001]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.869 --> 01:30:06.172]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:30:06.172 --> 01:30:08.933]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:30:08.933 --> 01:30:14.256]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:30:14.256 --> 01:30:18.738]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from InfoWars.com.

[01:31:01.353 --> 01:31:04.375]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:04.375 --> 01:31:09.699]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:09.699 --> 01:31:11.740]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:11.740 --> 01:31:16.744]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:16.744 --> 01:31:17.924]  How much do you want?
[01:31:17.924 --> 01:31:18.665]  When do you want it?
[01:31:19.045 --> 01:31:20.928]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:20.928 --> 01:31:22.009]  When will you need it?
[01:31:22.009 --> 01:31:24.212]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:24.212 --> 01:31:25.554]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:25.554 --> 01:31:27.076]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:27.076 --> 01:31:32.343]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:32.343 --> 01:31:35.468]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:35.908 --> 01:31:39.729]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:39.729 --> 01:31:40.969]  How much will you need?
[01:31:40.969 --> 01:31:41.870]  We don't know.
[01:31:41.870 --> 01:31:42.970]  How much do you want?
[01:31:42.970 --> 01:31:43.890]  All you can get.
[01:31:43.890 --> 01:31:44.990]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:44.990 --> 01:31:48.051]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:31:48.051 --> 01:31:49.811]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:49.811 --> 01:31:50.732]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:32:00.478 --> 01:32:01.779]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:01.779 --> 01:32:07.364]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:32:07.364 --> 01:32:12.389]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:32:12.389 --> 01:32:17.414]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:32:17.934 --> 01:32:23.181]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:32:23.181 --> 01:32:25.483]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:32:25.483 --> 01:32:30.289]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:32:30.289 --> 01:32:31.410]  And here's the best part.
[01:32:31.410 --> 01:32:34.494]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:32:34.494 --> 01:32:37.778]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:32:38.078 --> 01:32:41.279]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:41.279 --> 01:32:43.500]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:44.441]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:32:44.441 --> 01:32:44.841]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:32:44.841 --> 01:32:48.082]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:32:48.082 --> 01:32:49.803]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:33:12.116 --> 01:33:20.744]  There's a man going around taking names, and he decides who to free and who to blame.
[01:33:20.744 --> 01:33:24.908]  We're going live at PrisonPlanet.tv in the next segment.
[01:33:24.908 --> 01:33:37.139]  I'm going to get into basically the full spectrum of issues with Gerald Solente in the third and fourth hour today, Top Trends Forecaster.
[01:33:38.868 --> 01:33:42.030]  There are now scores of nations that have joined.
[01:33:42.030 --> 01:33:47.835]  I'm hearing about it all over talk radio, even some mainline talk radio.
[01:33:47.835 --> 01:33:53.799]  Another example of what one person can do with an idea, Karen Quinn Tostado.
[01:33:53.799 --> 01:33:57.942]  TaxFree15.com is the website.
[01:33:57.942 --> 01:34:05.128]  We had her on about a month ago talking about Tax Day and basically a national strike
[01:34:05.928 --> 01:34:12.032]  But also a time to educate ourselves about the nature of the private Federal Reserve.
[01:34:12.032 --> 01:34:18.977]  And the fact that our taxes all go, via the income tax, that tax all goes to the private central banks.
[01:34:18.977 --> 01:34:23.160]  The taxes go up, your so-called services go down.
[01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:26.742]  They were just getting you in debt before with the chicken feed.
[01:34:26.742 --> 01:34:32.426]  Now the services go bye-bye, or are used to basically euthanize you.
[01:34:32.426 --> 01:34:33.807]  Karen, it's good to have you on with us.
[01:34:34.605 --> 01:34:37.346]  Alex, thank you very much for having me back.
[01:34:37.346 --> 01:34:38.186]  You bet.
[01:34:38.186 --> 01:34:45.547]  For those that just joined us or may not know about the movement, recap it for us and talk about the success and what's coming up tomorrow and the next few days.
[01:34:45.547 --> 01:34:46.907]  Well, thank you.
[01:34:46.907 --> 01:34:52.389]  You know, since the last time we spoke, incredible things have really started to happen.
[01:34:52.389 --> 01:34:59.470]  With the help of dedicated Americans like yourself and activists all across this great country and the world,
[01:35:04.002 --> 01:35:05.383]  We're good to go.
[01:35:33.781 --> 01:35:48.636]  And it's a message though Alex, it's a message that has resonated within the hearts and the minds of the people because the plan is simple and all of us can participate in one form or another and this is not just an American problem, this is a global problem.
[01:35:51.283 --> 01:35:55.129]  So the plan is April 15th through April 18th.
[01:35:55.129 --> 01:36:02.559]  Now we need to get the attention of the corporations who really believe that they own us and let them know that they don't.
[01:36:02.559 --> 01:36:05.403]  So number one, no work, no school.
[01:36:05.403 --> 01:36:05.663]  Our future
[01:36:18.541 --> 01:36:19.282]  I don't know.
[01:36:41.263 --> 01:36:43.244]  Large corporations.
[01:36:43.244 --> 01:36:47.866]  That means fast food places like McDonald's, corporate online stores.
[01:36:47.866 --> 01:36:51.288]  Again, plan ahead for your medications, your gas, and your food.
[01:36:51.288 --> 01:36:54.370]  If you have to shop, go to a mom and pop.
[01:36:54.370 --> 01:36:58.192]  If you go online, go to a mom and pop online store.
[01:36:58.192 --> 01:37:02.414]  This is against the corporations who are robbing us blind, folks.
[01:37:02.414 --> 01:37:04.455]  Not against our neighbors.
[01:37:04.455 --> 01:37:06.196]  They are the people we need to support.
[01:37:06.849 --> 01:37:09.271]  The third step is don't comply.
[01:37:09.271 --> 01:37:12.873]  Put your savings in locally-owned banks or hard assets.
[01:37:12.873 --> 01:37:17.236]  If you do take hard assets, make sure you get them in your possession.
[01:37:17.236 --> 01:37:20.158]  Or leave only what you need to cover your monthly bills.
[01:37:20.158 --> 01:37:23.360]  Work at getting off the grid and forming co-ops within communities.
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:26.982]  Corporations are the target, folks.
[01:37:26.982 --> 01:37:27.883]  Not each other.
[01:37:27.883 --> 01:37:33.687]  We have to learn to read the... And by corporations you mean the Fortune 100, 500, the Globalist?
[01:37:33.687 --> 01:37:35.108]  That's exactly who I mean.
[01:37:36.321 --> 01:37:39.705]  So, and then the last step is ask why?
[01:37:39.705 --> 01:37:43.210]  You know, why are we here?
[01:37:43.210 --> 01:37:46.394]  Are we part of the problem or are we part of the solution?
[01:37:46.394 --> 01:37:49.477]  Because there is no other choice right now, folks.
[01:37:49.477 --> 01:37:51.680]  We fit in one of those categories.
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:52.361]  Why are we here?
[01:37:53.141 --> 01:38:07.244]  Yeah, this is a time to be reflective, to educate others, and to repent, and realize just how dire a straits we're in, to kind of slow down and regage what's happening.
[01:38:07.244 --> 01:38:09.044]  That's exactly right, Alex.
[01:38:09.044 --> 01:38:15.145]  And then we pick up the telephone and we call our misrepresentatives and ask them the same questions.
[01:38:15.145 --> 01:38:18.606]  And we tell them that we're participating in the strike, we are watching
[01:38:25.388 --> 01:38:29.070]  Because the 19th, folks, is Patriots Day.
[01:38:29.070 --> 01:38:31.911]  And a patriot is not just someone in America.
[01:38:31.911 --> 01:38:39.654]  A patriot is a person who loves, supports, and defends his or her country and its interests with devotion.
[01:38:39.654 --> 01:38:50.599]  And also, they defend their individual rights against presumed interference by the federal government, but it certainly is no longer presumed.
[01:38:50.599 --> 01:38:52.200]  I expected you to jump in there, Alex.
[01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:54.701]  You've got all kinds of reasons as to why it isn't presumed.
[01:38:56.098 --> 01:38:56.999]  No, you know what?
[01:38:56.999 --> 01:39:00.722]  I've learned to just keep my mouth shut or I will start interrupting because that's when I interrupt.
[01:39:00.722 --> 01:39:02.623]  I have all these ideas while you're talking.
[01:39:02.623 --> 01:39:08.908]  So I'm learning and seasoning myself to learn to keep my mouth shut sometimes.
[01:39:08.908 --> 01:39:12.491]  But the bigger issue here is you've only been doing this a few months.
[01:39:12.491 --> 01:39:14.092]  You've got 80 plus countries involved.
[01:39:14.092 --> 01:39:15.893]  There's a big buzz going.
[01:39:15.893 --> 01:39:17.094]  And as long as every 15th,
[01:39:18.115 --> 01:39:31.708]  We continue to use it as a time to call Congress, a time to educate others, a time to go speak at our city councils, a time to educate our children about our Bill of Rights, our Constitution, the alternative to this globalist corporate tyranny.
[01:39:31.708 --> 01:39:34.130]  This is, again, not a silver bullet.
[01:39:34.130 --> 01:39:36.392]  It's one more tool.
[01:39:36.392 --> 01:39:37.573]  Look at how I've promoted.
[01:39:38.354 --> 01:39:38.594]  I think?
[01:39:59.717 --> 01:40:06.920]  Now being confronted daily by We Are Change people, then uploading the video that tens of millions have seen.
[01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:22.488]  Other people are now mimicking the guerrilla journalism of going into events and injecting real issues, culture jamming the New World Order, short-circuiting their propaganda placement, their brainwashing placement, their behavior placement as they call it.
[01:40:23.288 --> 01:40:31.175]  The act of resistance is victory, peaceably in the info war, and that's why what you're doing is so exciting.
[01:40:31.175 --> 01:40:37.020]  So again, also bring other people in to the TaxFree15.com movement.
[01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:45.668]  And if you've got ideas, start your own movement, or your own operation, because they can't shut us all down, and our message is now
[01:40:45.828 --> 01:40:50.335]  Cutting through that electronic Berlin Wall more and more.
[01:40:50.335 --> 01:40:52.098]  And so, the battle's joined.
[01:40:52.098 --> 01:40:54.622]  We're not winning, but we're not losing.
[01:40:54.622 --> 01:40:59.409]  We're in the fight, and it's up to all of you how this contest is going to end.
[01:41:00.256 --> 01:41:01.637]  That's exactly right.
[01:41:01.637 --> 01:41:07.962]  And one of the best things, though, about this, Alex, is we're not telling people how to think or who to believe.
[01:41:07.962 --> 01:41:25.676]  We're telling them to take some time out so they can really do some research and find out for themselves if the belief systems they have are actually ones that they have explored, that they have researched, or if they've just been propagandized to the point where they really don't know why they believe it.
[01:41:25.676 --> 01:41:27.978]  And we need to have courage in this country.
[01:41:31.589 --> 01:41:32.170]  We're good to go.
[01:41:52.008 --> 01:41:59.012]  Why we are murdering and torturing and why, globally, our economy is based on war.
[01:41:59.012 --> 01:42:01.894]  This is the 21st century, folks.
[01:42:01.894 --> 01:42:03.455]  It is time to stop that.
[01:42:03.455 --> 01:42:08.078]  It is time to recognize we don't have to give our power away to other people.
[01:42:08.078 --> 01:42:14.922]  We don't have to abandon our homes and our lives and our families to cook and clean and fight and die for other people.
[01:42:14.922 --> 01:42:17.784]  We have God-given rights.
[01:42:17.784 --> 01:42:20.285]  This is the time to rise.
[01:42:20.285 --> 01:42:21.886]  Our flesh has forgotten what our
[01:42:23.088 --> 01:42:26.734]  We are sovereign individuals.
[01:42:26.734 --> 01:42:29.558]  We, the people, must save our countries.
[01:42:29.558 --> 01:42:31.321]  Governments have sold us out.
[01:42:31.321 --> 01:42:34.706]  We, the people, it is time to awaken and rise.
[01:42:35.629 --> 01:42:38.290]  Absolutely, and continue to awaken others.
[01:42:38.290 --> 01:42:41.852]  That is one of the most important keys to this scenario.
[01:42:41.852 --> 01:42:46.314]  So again, people can go to TaxFree15.com and learn more.
[01:42:46.314 --> 01:42:52.677]  And I mean, I knew this was going to be successful because of your passion and because the message was very clear-cut.
[01:42:53.377 --> 01:43:07.843]  and strong and reality-based and so now I'm just excited to see so many people joining Karen Quinn Testada in what she is doing and so how does this kick off tomorrow?
[01:43:07.843 --> 01:43:15.226]  I mean, well that's one quick question and then secondarily it's also very important for all of our listeners out there and activists
[01:43:16.570 --> 01:43:19.091]  To call your local radio and TV station.
[01:43:19.091 --> 01:43:20.811]  They're the easiest to get on.
[01:43:20.811 --> 01:43:23.992]  And to direct them to this grassroots movement.
[01:43:23.992 --> 01:43:28.254]  Because the establishment is trying to co-opt all the grassroots movements.
[01:43:28.254 --> 01:43:37.777]  During the break, Rob Dew was in here showing me a Yahoo story and a video sponsored by Toyota.
[01:43:38.928 --> 01:43:55.336]  Claiming that some Republican-backed group started the Tea Party in 2009 and branding it as an establishment system in the name of giving it support when the Tea Parties were started in 2005 by the 9-11 truth and then in their current
[01:43:58.097 --> 01:43:58.858]  Well, this, Alex, fits into
[01:44:22.329 --> 01:44:22.849]  We're good to go.
[01:44:42.922 --> 01:44:47.264]  Some people want to go out and join some of these Tea Party rallies.
[01:44:47.264 --> 01:44:51.206]  We're encouraging them to bring their lunch, to bring a video camera.
[01:44:51.206 --> 01:45:02.472]  Other people who are afraid to show up in public because they've been listening to the provocateurs, because they know there's danger out there, can know that they are participating from the safety of their own home.
[01:45:02.472 --> 01:45:05.153]  Just by not spending a dime at a corporate place,
[01:45:05.433 --> 01:45:05.854]  I don't know.
[01:45:21.052 --> 01:45:21.452]  We're good to go.
[01:45:42.525 --> 01:45:44.305]  And that's what the corporatists do.
[01:45:44.305 --> 01:45:55.588]  They build a big government, they get you dependent, they get you in compact cities, then they cut off the resources, and then they tell you through environmentalism that you're a cancer, you're a scourge, humans are bad.
[01:45:55.588 --> 01:45:59.609]  This is the elite waging war on their fellow man.
[01:45:59.609 --> 01:46:04.770]  They see us as a scourge eating their resources, when the truth is the elites
[01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:10.193]  I have tried to dumb the public down because they're challenged by free humanity.
[01:46:10.193 --> 01:46:18.458]  They are despicable, jealous, envious, control freaks that must be identified and must be defeated.
[01:46:18.458 --> 01:46:21.720]  Karen Quinn Tostada, I want to thank you for joining us.
[01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:33.368]  TaxFree15.com is a portal to all things Tax Free 15 and we'll talk to you some more coming up next week in the aftermath for a quick pop-in to see how this went.
[01:46:33.368 --> 01:46:34.649]  Karen, thank you and I salute you.
[01:46:35.149 --> 01:46:36.410]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:46:36.410 --> 01:46:38.251]  God bless.
[01:46:38.251 --> 01:46:48.058]  Speaking of provocateurs, I told you Al Turner was a Fed, and I told you that there were Feds infiltrating the Hatari militia last August, and they did, and set them up.
[01:46:48.058 --> 01:46:50.901]  I tried to warn Hatari, but what do I know?
[01:46:52.263 --> 01:46:56.045]  I told you they're trying to infiltrate Oath Keepers to claim they're violent.
[01:46:56.045 --> 01:47:04.228]  Oath Keepers has put out a press release, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com, saying they had to cancel being part of the Second Amendment Tea Party march in D.C.
[01:47:04.228 --> 01:47:07.110]  because provocateurs were going to show up and claim they were Oath Keepers.
[01:47:08.328 --> 01:47:10.010]  I'm not even saying that's good or bad.
[01:47:10.010 --> 01:47:28.966]  They made their decision to do that, but we caught the anarchist a month ago, and then again two weeks ago, and then again last week, on all their big foundation-funded, government-funded websites, saying they were going to infiltrate the Tea Parties and hold up N-word signs and act like kooks with the media, and that now hit the AP yesterday.
[01:47:28.966 --> 01:47:30.548]  This is real.
[01:47:30.548 --> 01:47:32.450]  That's how criminal this government is.
[01:47:33.814 --> 01:47:40.492]  They're on the news saying it's a bunch of white supremacists at these meetings and so they will send their white supremacist.
[01:47:40.492 --> 01:47:42.337]  I say go ahead and have your meetings.
[01:47:43.595 --> 01:47:48.539]  In fact, more people need to show up and just identify these individuals for who they are.
[01:47:48.539 --> 01:47:49.460]  That's how the web works.
[01:47:49.460 --> 01:48:03.551]  You videotape them, you put out your suspicions, you follow them to their car, you keep your distance, you get their license plate, you run their plates, you find out they're a cop, or Southern Poverty Law Center, or an ADL, and we keep hurting them bad.
[01:48:04.272 --> 01:48:07.193]  Look, you don't defeat the enemy without finding the enemy.
[01:48:07.193 --> 01:48:11.394]  And I agree, we've got to choose our battles.
[01:48:11.394 --> 01:48:13.655]  But we're kicking their hind in.
[01:48:13.655 --> 01:48:15.755]  That's why they're panicking.
[01:48:15.755 --> 01:48:17.236]  That's why they're scared.
[01:48:17.236 --> 01:48:23.838]  That's why they've got articles every day, there was a new article today, saying I'm calling for violence when I'm calling for the opposite.
[01:48:23.838 --> 01:48:28.579]  Because they are playing to the dumbed-down public, who's only halfway listening.
[01:48:29.755 --> 01:48:32.876]  They're just trying to put out the lie long enough to people believe it.
[01:48:32.876 --> 01:48:36.638]  You know, these tea parties are chanting the N-word.
[01:48:36.638 --> 01:48:38.158]  And they're not.
[01:48:38.158 --> 01:48:42.840]  So now, since that's been exposed, they're gonna dispatch their people.
[01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:44.000]  I mean, folks, they did this to me.
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:45.521]  One time I was having a land rights rally.
[01:48:46.950 --> 01:48:52.035]  It was 1997, we may have had 200 people at the Capitol, and some Klan guys show up.
[01:48:52.035 --> 01:49:03.565]  And I saw them in the parking lot across the street, in the state police parking lot where I've seen them stage things before, talking to cops, and then I later saw them leave and cops drive out behind them.
[01:49:03.565 --> 01:49:05.026]  They were cops!
[01:49:05.026 --> 01:49:08.769]  They're in clown... I had a Freudian slip.
[01:49:08.769 --> 01:49:09.870]  Clown outfits.
[01:49:09.870 --> 01:49:10.291]  Klan
[01:49:12.145 --> 01:49:14.107]  Wizard outfits.
[01:49:14.107 --> 01:49:17.990]  And I walked over and said, I know you're cops and I'm going to expose you if you're part of this rally.
[01:49:17.990 --> 01:49:19.752]  So they left.
[01:49:19.752 --> 01:49:22.674]  I mean, I've been dealing with this forever.
[01:49:22.674 --> 01:49:25.357]  This is not my first rodeo, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:25.357 --> 01:49:36.927]  I've been in rodeo after rodeo after rodeo, and I'd have to be as dumb as a box of rocks to not know how this works and how these people operate.
[01:49:36.927 --> 01:49:37.047]  And
[01:49:41.550 --> 01:49:42.591]  I'm trying to dig up the video.
[01:49:42.591 --> 01:49:45.133]  There's a short clip of it online, but there's got to be an hour of it.
[01:49:45.133 --> 01:49:46.354]  I know we aired it on AXS TV.
[01:49:46.354 --> 01:49:47.574]  I know Mike Hanson's got it.
[01:49:47.574 --> 01:49:56.201]  He's got to dig through those thousands of videos of one big Klan rally in Waco.
[01:49:57.796 --> 01:49:59.317]  And the Klan have been out there at the site.
[01:49:59.317 --> 01:50:03.958]  We were building a memorial church for those that died, starting fights and doing stuff.
[01:50:03.958 --> 01:50:06.219]  And then they were having a rally, and I went and looked at them.
[01:50:06.219 --> 01:50:07.900]  I could tell they were all cops, the leadership.
[01:50:07.900 --> 01:50:10.201]  There was only about nine or ten of them.
[01:50:10.201 --> 01:50:11.261]  I mean, they were all cops.
[01:50:11.261 --> 01:50:11.842]  I can look at them.
[01:50:11.842 --> 01:50:12.942]  I can assess them.
[01:50:12.942 --> 01:50:15.163]  They were cops and informants.
[01:50:15.163 --> 01:50:18.244]  And I was screaming, Big Fat Federal Agent, the whole time.
[01:50:18.244 --> 01:50:21.025]  And I had cops come over and try to start fights with me.
[01:50:21.025 --> 01:50:21.765]  There's footage of this.
[01:50:23.933 --> 01:50:26.574]  We should have had the money and time back then to chronicle all this and save it.
[01:50:26.574 --> 01:50:29.315]  It's so important now.
[01:50:29.315 --> 01:50:34.096]  And they had a parking garage across the street from the county courthouse there in Waco.
[01:50:34.096 --> 01:50:37.057]  And they had two cops with sniper rifles.
[01:50:37.057 --> 01:50:38.958]  And guess who they were tracking the whole time?
[01:50:38.958 --> 01:50:41.978]  I was wearing a t-shirt and jeans, clearly had no weapon.
[01:50:41.978 --> 01:50:43.239]  They had their crosshairs on me.
[01:50:45.492 --> 01:50:48.575]  Because I was there exposing their bullies.
[01:50:48.575 --> 01:50:55.581]  By the way, it was a pro-Waco survivor clan rally to demonize the Waco survivors who wanted no part of it.
[01:50:55.581 --> 01:50:59.025]  And the cops got mad that I was there screaming big fat federal agent at their men.
[01:51:01.397 --> 01:51:02.698]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.698 --> 01:51:08.282]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:08.282 --> 01:51:13.305]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.305 --> 01:51:18.869]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.

[01:54:09.334 --> 01:54:10.955]  Okay, I'm gonna go right to this video.
[01:54:10.955 --> 01:54:11.855]  The article is...
[01:54:12.972 --> 01:54:15.635]  This is the beginning of what happens when you lose a democracy.
[01:54:32.597 --> 01:54:36.140]  Richard Vine is an accomplished attorney who holds a Ph.D.
[01:54:36.140 --> 01:54:43.186]  in international law and was an antitrust attorney with the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C.
[01:54:43.186 --> 01:54:55.937]  He is sounding the clarion call from his cell in the Los Angeles County Central Men's Jail, where he is being held without trial, without bail, without an attorney, and with every appeal denied.
[01:54:56.775 --> 01:54:59.496]  Oh, there's absolutely no question that I'm a political prisoner.
[01:54:59.496 --> 01:55:01.357]  I mean, none whatsoever.
[01:55:01.357 --> 01:55:09.380]  Because the political circumstance that has created this situation is that you have a straight out and out abuse of power
[01:55:10.305 --> 01:55:15.830]  That is taking place here, and I am the person that went in and called them on it.
[01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:23.156]  You have the county supervisors taking public tax money and paying off the judges.
[01:55:23.156 --> 01:55:28.761]  And in return, what happens is that the judges decide the cases in favor of the county.
[01:55:29.602 --> 01:55:40.530]  The next thing that you have is you have the state legislature going in and giving the judges and the county supervisors immunity for their actions.
[01:55:40.530 --> 01:55:53.719]  At the same point in time, you have the judges going to the state bar to get me disbarred for the case that I brought to say that the people have been denied due process.
[01:55:53.719 --> 01:55:53.860]  So,
[01:55:55.014 --> 01:55:57.036]  This is a pure political thing.
[01:55:57.036 --> 01:56:03.922]  This is actually the biggest judicial scandal and judicial bribery scheme in American history.
[01:56:03.922 --> 01:56:08.986]  He warns us from his personal experience that this could happen to you.
[01:56:08.986 --> 01:56:20.556]  My being in jail for one year and possibly longer should show you that nobody is immune from this abuse of power.
[01:56:21.340 --> 01:56:26.322]  Our forefathers warned us about this peril in the Declaration of Independence.
[01:56:26.322 --> 01:56:36.386]  If you go back into a very interesting thing and read the end part of the Declaration of Independence, they talk about the judges being bought out by the king.
[01:56:36.386 --> 01:56:42.088]  And America in the beginning didn't have any judicial system because it was all being run by the king.
[01:56:42.088 --> 01:56:44.129]  And that's one of the reasons why we rebelled.
[01:56:44.129 --> 01:56:50.571]  His situation is a foreshadowing that America is sliding into the despotism of a banana republic.
[01:56:51.431 --> 01:57:12.517]  What is happening here in the United States right now, with my sitting in this jail, in this orange outfit, means that the government that is taking place here, with the loss of our judiciary, and that's what it is, is the same thing that is happening in Iran, where they're throwing people in jail for protesting about an election.
[01:57:12.517 --> 01:57:14.398]  It's the same thing that is happening in Myanmar.
[01:57:15.825 --> 01:57:21.887]  Okay, we're going to come back in the next segment, the next five minutes, and then Gerald Salenti joins us and play the rest of this and comment.
[01:57:21.887 --> 01:57:26.968]  But in this case, Judicial Watch had to file a lawsuit months after he was in jail.
[01:57:26.968 --> 01:57:28.888]  The sheriff won't say why he's in jail.
[01:57:28.888 --> 01:57:32.429]  There's no record.
[01:57:32.429 --> 01:57:35.350]  They just say that he is now to stay in jail basically
[01:57:36.530 --> 01:57:38.311]  Potentially forever.
[01:57:38.311 --> 01:57:41.633]  And the Supreme Court's having an emergency hearing on it this week.
[01:57:41.633 --> 01:57:45.335]  There's a protest on April 20th about it.
[01:57:45.335 --> 01:57:49.978]  He never got charged, never had a trial, there's been no conviction or any sentence to keep him there.
[01:57:49.978 --> 01:57:58.102]  Sheriff Leroy Baca claims he does not know why Fein is in jail, yet he keeps him there and has failed to answer Fein's writ of habeas corpus.
[01:57:58.102 --> 01:58:00.524]  Baca refused to allow a film interview
[01:58:01.184 --> 01:58:05.867]  With fine until Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit on behalf of Full Disclosure Network.
[01:58:05.867 --> 01:58:07.968]  We're going to get them on next week.
[01:58:07.968 --> 01:58:15.873]  And then, out of the blue, he changed his mind and granted a filmed interview with them.
[01:58:15.873 --> 01:58:17.534]  And we're going to go over more of this coming up.
[01:58:17.534 --> 01:58:19.195]  But folks, this is happening all over the country.
[01:58:19.195 --> 01:58:20.936]  Remember CNN?
[01:58:20.936 --> 01:58:22.717]  This is going on nationwide.
[01:58:22.717 --> 01:58:26.179]  Pennsylvania rocked by jailing kids for cash scandal.
[01:58:26.179 --> 01:58:26.900]  The judge
[01:58:28.095 --> 01:58:35.577]  A bunch of judges were being paid money to put innocent people in jail by the private prison contractors.
[01:58:35.577 --> 01:58:37.598]  This is how America works.
[01:58:37.598 --> 01:58:38.778]  Just like Tulia, Texas.
[01:58:38.778 --> 01:58:43.039]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:43.039 --> 01:58:45.640]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.640 --> 01:58:48.841]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.

[01:58:56.687 --> 01:59:05.550]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:59:05.550 --> 01:59:10.172]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:59:10.172 --> 01:59:20.996]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.

[01:59:53.914 --> 01:59:56.315]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.315 --> 02:00:05.800]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:07.101]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.101 --> 02:00:08.882]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.882 --> 02:00:10.043]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.043 --> 02:00:12.224]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.224 --> 02:00:13.784]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.784 --> 02:00:17.967]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.967 --> 02:00:22.049]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.929 --> 02:00:24.169]  Tyranny is here.
[02:00:24.169 --> 02:00:27.170]  I can't tell you how many mainstream news articles I've read.
[02:00:27.170 --> 02:00:31.031]  For big cities, small towns, you name it.
[02:00:31.031 --> 02:00:33.951]  Small towns tend to be the worst per capita.
[02:00:33.951 --> 02:00:39.272]  The cops just pull people over, steal their cars, steal their money, plant drugs on them.
[02:00:39.272 --> 02:00:43.093]  You'll have the mayor's brother owning a local private prison.
[02:00:43.093 --> 02:00:47.254]  In some cases they'll have half of the town in the jail.
[02:00:48.434 --> 02:00:52.420]  In the case of Tulia, Texas, more than half the black people in the town were in the jail.
[02:00:52.420 --> 02:00:53.481]  They planted drugs on them.
[02:00:53.481 --> 02:00:55.664]  That all came out later.
[02:00:55.664 --> 02:00:59.288]  And then you get this case now going to the Supreme Court.
[02:00:59.288 --> 02:01:01.011]  Epic corruption in the whistleblower.
[02:01:02.501 --> 02:01:03.963]  I don't think so.
[02:01:23.061 --> 02:01:26.403]  And this guy is in jail, and they won't even tell the Supreme Court while they're there.
[02:01:26.403 --> 02:01:28.404]  They just say, look, he's in jail.
[02:01:28.404 --> 02:01:29.445]  That's the end of it.
[02:01:29.445 --> 02:01:31.065]  This is the essence of tyranny.
[02:01:31.065 --> 02:01:35.228]  But remember, I just used a case that did get some national attention.
[02:01:35.228 --> 02:01:39.910]  Pennsylvania rocked by jailing kids for cash scandal.
[02:01:39.910 --> 02:01:40.671]  This is how it works.
[02:01:42.512 --> 02:01:50.058]  Most of the family court judges, if you investigate them, you find out they're living in million-dollar houses, and they're getting money from the different adoption agencies.
[02:01:50.058 --> 02:01:52.040]  I mean, they hunt your family.
[02:01:52.040 --> 02:01:52.921]  This is slavery.
[02:01:52.921 --> 02:01:54.542]  Slavery's legal in America.
[02:01:54.542 --> 02:01:56.144]  Torture's legal.
[02:01:56.144 --> 02:01:57.425]  They have different names for it.
[02:01:57.425 --> 02:02:00.667]  Pain Compliance, CPS.
[02:02:00.667 --> 02:02:01.928]  Let's finish up this video.
[02:02:01.928 --> 02:02:02.989]  Here it is.
[02:02:02.989 --> 02:02:04.631]  If you look in today's LA Times,
[02:02:05.205 --> 02:02:10.650]  Where you've had a repressive government in there for 30 years where people haven't voted.
[02:02:10.650 --> 02:02:16.095]  It's the same thing that's happening in the corruption in Afghanistan and corruption in Iraq.
[02:02:16.095 --> 02:02:24.162]  Short of rebellion, Mr. Fine implores us to take the only action left to us while we still have the ability to act.
[02:02:24.162 --> 02:02:26.524]  And you vote the bums out.
[02:02:26.524 --> 02:02:28.526]  And that is what it comes down to.
[02:02:29.093 --> 02:02:47.528]  This is only a brief excerpt of an exclusive jailhouse interview where Richard Fine explains how all the forces from greedy local developers to the State Bar Association to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals all conspired to protect the illegal payments that are still being paid to the L.A.
[02:02:47.528 --> 02:02:48.909]  Superior Court judges.
[02:02:50.496 --> 02:02:53.638]  And you can go to Infowars.com and link through.
[02:02:53.638 --> 02:02:56.861]  We're going to have them on next week, and they've reached out to us.
[02:02:56.861 --> 02:02:58.202]  That's how we even know about this.
[02:02:58.202 --> 02:03:00.843]  I mean, I knew about the Supreme Court issue and this guy's case.
[02:03:00.843 --> 02:03:03.966]  I'd seen it in a few newspapers, but I didn't realize the full magnitude.
[02:03:03.966 --> 02:03:05.367]  So we're in contact with them.
[02:03:05.367 --> 02:03:10.710]  We're going to try to get more of the interview to play here next week because Mr. Fine is behind bars.
[02:03:10.710 --> 02:03:12.732]  There is a protest coming up next week.
[02:03:13.412 --> 02:03:14.152]  They're in LA.
[02:03:14.152 --> 02:03:17.094]  You can find out more at InfoWars.com.
[02:03:17.094 --> 02:03:22.455]  Epic corruption and the whistleblower, Cassandra Anderson, InfoWars.com.
[02:03:22.455 --> 02:03:27.237]  Great job to everybody out there exposing this tyranny.
[02:03:27.237 --> 02:03:29.858]  I mean, how do you think the IRS courts work?
[02:03:29.858 --> 02:03:33.500]  Unelected criminal courts that just take people's property without due process.
[02:03:33.500 --> 02:03:35.360]  How do you think the environmental courts work?
[02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:38.141]  Taking people's farms and ranches without due process.
[02:03:38.141 --> 02:03:39.502]  I mean, how do you think the CPS
[02:03:40.609 --> 02:03:42.210]  There's no jury.
[02:03:42.210 --> 02:03:46.654]  They didn't have them until about 100 years ago, or less, about 95 years ago.
[02:03:46.654 --> 02:03:53.920]  England, over 100 years ago, had set up racial hygiene family courts to sterilize people, eugenics.
[02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:54.480]  The U.S.
[02:03:54.480 --> 02:03:55.681]  adopted it, and the U.S.
[02:03:55.681 --> 02:04:01.065]  financed Germany through the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, and then Adolf Hitler to do what he did.
[02:04:01.065 --> 02:04:03.728]  Family courts are part of the health department.
[02:04:03.728 --> 02:04:08.772]  It is a eugenics guild to mop up and go after society.
[02:04:11.505 --> 02:04:12.485]  It's not due process.
[02:04:12.485 --> 02:04:35.593]  So, this is all heavily inculcated, and then now, it talks about kids that did nothing wrong, swept up by police, they were getting paid off, this is in Philadelphia, sent in and given year-long, six-month, two-year-long sentences in a private juvenile prison, and it says the private juvenile prison was giving
[02:04:38.192 --> 02:04:46.576]  $2.6 million to two different judges.
[02:04:46.576 --> 02:04:51.137]  $2.6 million to kidnap your children.
[02:04:51.137 --> 02:04:51.758]  And then the cops?
[02:04:52.847 --> 02:04:54.068]  Talking thousands a week.
[02:04:54.068 --> 02:04:56.490]  Good job, just keep bringing them in here.
[02:04:56.490 --> 02:05:00.233]  And those cops say, absolutely, these people are trash.
[02:05:00.233 --> 02:05:01.054]  Oh, we love it.
[02:05:01.054 --> 02:05:05.097]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[02:05:05.097 --> 02:05:06.358]  Tyranny is here.
[02:05:06.358 --> 02:05:10.301]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:05:10.301 --> 02:05:12.543]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:05:12.543 --> 02:05:17.928]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:05:18.388 --> 02:05:25.057]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:05:25.057 --> 02:05:31.004]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:05:31.004 --> 02:05:34.669]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:05:35.189 --> 02:05:39.491]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:05:39.491 --> 02:05:45.434]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:05:45.434 --> 02:05:48.995]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:05:48.995 --> 02:05:50.956]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:05:50.956 --> 02:05:52.097]  It's here.

[02:06:12.967 --> 02:06:21.674]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:06:21.674 --> 02:06:25.757]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:06:25.757 --> 02:06:28.119]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:06:30.011 --> 02:06:34.773]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:06:34.773 --> 02:06:38.595]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[02:06:38.595 --> 02:06:39.835]  Others don't.
[02:06:39.835 --> 02:06:41.976]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:06:41.976 --> 02:06:43.757]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:06:43.757 --> 02:06:46.658]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:06:46.658 --> 02:06:50.900]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.

[02:06:58.343 --> 02:06:59.224]  Others don't.
[02:07:01.260 --> 02:07:04.264]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:07:04.264 --> 02:07:09.591]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:07:09.591 --> 02:07:11.654]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:07:11.654 --> 02:07:16.660]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:07:16.660 --> 02:07:17.842]  How much do you want?
[02:07:17.842 --> 02:07:18.563]  When do you want it?
[02:07:18.943 --> 02:07:20.825]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:07:20.825 --> 02:07:21.907]  When will you need it?
[02:07:21.907 --> 02:07:24.109]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:07:24.109 --> 02:07:25.451]  Will there be any food?
[02:07:25.451 --> 02:07:26.973]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:07:26.973 --> 02:07:32.239]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:07:32.239 --> 02:07:35.383]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:07:35.803 --> 02:07:39.627]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:07:39.627 --> 02:07:40.868]  How much will you need?
[02:07:40.868 --> 02:07:41.769]  We don't know.
[02:07:41.769 --> 02:07:42.870]  How much do you want?
[02:07:42.870 --> 02:07:43.811]  All you can get.
[02:07:43.811 --> 02:07:44.912]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:44.912 --> 02:07:47.955]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:07:47.955 --> 02:07:51.078]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:51.078 --> 02:07:51.599]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:08:01.383 --> 02:08:06.775]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.775 --> 02:08:09.079]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:16.937 --> 02:08:27.302]  We are joined via video Skype connection for the next hour and 52 minutes by Gerald Salente, founder of the Trends Research Institute in 1980.
[02:08:27.302 --> 02:08:28.623]  TrendsResearch.com.
[02:08:28.623 --> 02:08:31.004]  He really doesn't need any introduction to this audience.
[02:08:31.004 --> 02:08:35.547]  Plus he's all over CNN, Fox, MSNBC, you name it.
[02:08:35.547 --> 02:08:37.528]  He is a best-selling author.
[02:08:37.528 --> 02:08:41.490]  And I wanted to get him on to talk about the deterioration in the world.
[02:08:41.490 --> 02:08:45.412]  What he predicted two and a half, three years ago that they would come after the pension funds.
[02:08:46.252 --> 02:08:58.302]  That the banks would further bankrupt society, that they would cut city and county services, while at the same time raising taxes, that tax rebellions would form, that people would be on the streets.
[02:08:58.302 --> 02:08:59.803]  Again, this is two and a half, three years ago.
[02:08:59.803 --> 02:09:03.085]  That's now all beginning to happen.
[02:09:03.966 --> 02:09:05.228]  And where he sees this going.
[02:09:05.228 --> 02:09:06.769]  Also, Obama fear-mongering.
[02:09:06.769 --> 02:09:11.414]  We know Governor Ridge put out fake terror alerts and has now admitted it.
[02:09:11.414 --> 02:09:13.196]  The nuclear 9-11.
[02:09:13.196 --> 02:09:15.658]  Now Obama's saying this again.
[02:09:15.658 --> 02:09:17.380]  They're talking about going into Iran.
[02:09:17.380 --> 02:09:19.342]  There are so many issues I want to discuss.
[02:09:21.351 --> 02:09:27.858]  I want to take your phone calls for questions and comments for Gerald Salente.
[02:09:27.858 --> 02:09:29.560]  And basically, the sky's the limit.
[02:09:29.560 --> 02:09:33.464]  You can talk about whatever you want with him.
[02:09:33.464 --> 02:09:33.644]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:09:33.644 --> 02:09:34.285]  I appreciate him.
[02:09:34.285 --> 02:09:39.450]  He's a very busy person, giving us this in-depth, extended interview today.
[02:09:39.450 --> 02:09:41.052]  Gerald, it's good to have you back with us.
[02:09:41.052 --> 02:09:42.794]  Oh, it's always great being on with you, Alex.
[02:09:43.880 --> 02:09:50.302]  So much has been developing and unfolding and happening, and I have my list of questions, but what's coming out in the next Trends Journal?
[02:09:50.302 --> 02:09:52.783]  What are you focused on right now?
[02:09:52.783 --> 02:09:59.045]  The next Trends Journal is going to be out in a day or two, and the headline story is the Great War.
[02:09:59.045 --> 02:10:04.467]  They're leading us to the Great War, the first Great War of the new millennium.
[02:10:04.467 --> 02:10:08.108]  And you touched on it with the fear-mongering that they're throwing out there.
[02:10:09.342 --> 02:10:11.424]  Let's go back to 1920s.
[02:10:11.424 --> 02:10:15.148]  It was the same scheme, just a different time.
[02:10:15.148 --> 02:10:18.972]  The Wall Street gang bankrupted the nation.
[02:10:18.972 --> 02:10:23.076]  They had a different Ponzi scheme, or a Madoff scheme.
[02:10:23.076 --> 02:10:25.619]  And the markets crashed in 29.
[02:10:25.619 --> 02:10:29.382]  We go into a severe depression, and what do they do?
[02:10:29.382 --> 02:10:32.746]  They lead you to war after they try everything else.
[02:10:33.598 --> 02:10:36.241]  We're about to have the bailout bubble burst.
[02:10:36.241 --> 02:10:38.865]  First we had the dot-com bubble go bust.
[02:10:38.865 --> 02:10:43.351]  They re-inflated that with the real estate and credit crisis bubble.
[02:10:43.351 --> 02:10:44.712]  That broke.
[02:10:44.712 --> 02:10:51.762]  Rather than letting the big boys on Wall Street lose any money, they loaned them trillions of dollars for free.
[02:10:52.422 --> 02:10:53.023]  We're good to go.
[02:11:08.399 --> 02:11:09.699]  And you said that a year ago.
[02:11:09.699 --> 02:11:18.202]  You said it would run out, and that they would want more, and now they're saying not just more bailout, now the bankers are telling us, we want value added.
[02:11:18.202 --> 02:11:19.722]  We want carbon taxes.
[02:11:19.722 --> 02:11:21.343]  We want sales taxes.
[02:11:21.343 --> 02:11:26.544]  And we're going to destroy the economy, just like back in October of 08, when they held us hostage.
[02:11:26.544 --> 02:11:31.625]  They said, you give us unlimited trillions, and you let us keep it secret, or there's going to be a depression.
[02:11:31.625 --> 02:11:34.946]  And Congress said no, so they went out and bad-mouthed the economy.
[02:11:34.946 --> 02:11:36.767]  The stock market plunged by almost half.
[02:11:37.327 --> 02:11:40.272]  Congress passed it, and now they're holding us hostage again.
[02:11:40.272 --> 02:11:41.734]  That's right.
[02:11:41.734 --> 02:11:45.981]  And what they're going to do, and this is what the Trench Journal's all about, it's the Great War.
[02:11:46.838 --> 02:11:51.663]  And tracking trends is the knowledge of where we are, a clear understanding.
[02:11:51.663 --> 02:11:55.727]  How we got here, so that we can see where we're going.
[02:11:55.727 --> 02:12:02.314]  And you go look back at the last two great wars that they've foisted on the American economy.
[02:12:02.314 --> 02:12:04.516]  Look what they started with Afghanistan.
[02:12:04.516 --> 02:12:10.622]  It began with, we're going to get Osama Bin Laden and those evil doers and bring them to justice.
[02:12:11.122 --> 02:12:14.184]  And now 10 years later, no Osama Bin Laden.
[02:12:14.184 --> 02:12:18.026]  Now they're giving a free, a blind eye to opium production.
[02:12:18.026 --> 02:12:19.407]  That's a New York Times story.
[02:12:19.407 --> 02:12:20.968]  We're not making that up.
[02:12:20.968 --> 02:12:23.970]  And then the Iraq War is a total loser.
[02:12:23.970 --> 02:12:26.691]  And now they're extending the war into Pakistan.
[02:12:26.691 --> 02:12:28.172]  And that's a big one.
[02:12:28.172 --> 02:12:30.374]  So what we're looking at is the Great War.
[02:12:30.374 --> 02:12:33.455]  They're taking the world to war.
[02:12:33.455 --> 02:12:36.277]  Look at who these people are.
[02:12:36.277 --> 02:12:39.299]  Obama, Bush, Clinton, Gates.
[02:12:40.239 --> 02:12:41.700]  Uh, Mick Crystal.
[02:12:41.700 --> 02:12:46.004]  They're levels between psychopaths and sociopaths.
[02:12:46.004 --> 02:12:47.905]  And that's all they are.
[02:12:47.905 --> 02:12:50.647]  And people are looking up to these people.
[02:12:50.647 --> 02:12:59.433]  And most of them, of course, you know, they've never worn a uniform or fought in one, and they all talk tough about what we have to do.
[02:12:59.433 --> 02:13:03.436]  We means you and me, and the taxes are the other issue.
[02:13:03.436 --> 02:13:04.797]  So that's what we're writing about.
[02:13:06.363 --> 02:13:09.008]  Well, I mean, you called it.
[02:13:09.008 --> 02:13:13.637]  The banks are openly telling the government what to do, just like Iceland, just like Greece.
[02:13:15.100 --> 02:13:24.064]  And I want to get back into the big war and how they plan to get there, but let's first move back to the domestic front.
[02:13:24.064 --> 02:13:26.025]  What is Washington thinking?
[02:13:26.025 --> 02:13:36.671]  22 plus percent real unemployment, jobless claims going way up, people's pay going way down, the economy definitely going into depression.
[02:13:37.751 --> 02:13:41.214]  And the government at the federal level is just growing, growing, growing.
[02:13:41.214 --> 02:13:49.141]  Meanwhile, Ohio, Texas, Michigan, New Jersey laying off half the cops or more than half the sheriff's deputies in many cities.
[02:13:49.141 --> 02:13:51.162]  Four day a week school.
[02:13:51.162 --> 02:13:56.166]  They're making DMV workers in California work five days only be paid for four.
[02:13:56.166 --> 02:13:57.608]  Can't people recognize that
[02:13:58.248 --> 02:14:09.623]  We're going into a third world, Argentine or Nigerian scenario, where 90% of the money goes to the Madoffs through their fraud, and then we pay more taxes, but we get less services.
[02:14:09.623 --> 02:14:11.305]  I mean, this is insane!
[02:14:11.305 --> 02:14:14.289]  Well, let's take the first question you asked.
[02:14:14.289 --> 02:14:15.651]  What are they thinking about?
[02:14:16.365 --> 02:14:18.246]  This is the red carpet crowd.
[02:14:18.246 --> 02:14:20.387]  They don't think about anything.
[02:14:20.387 --> 02:14:22.768]  Look at the way that they live.
[02:14:22.768 --> 02:14:29.132]  Everywhere they go, they fly around in jet planes big enough to move half a city.
[02:14:29.132 --> 02:14:37.496]  Every time they arrive, their red carpet comes out, they salute the band plays, and they have great dinners.
[02:14:38.107 --> 02:14:47.555]  And it goes on from the secretaries of this or that to all these two-bit congressmen that are treated like royalty every time they go abroad.
[02:14:47.555 --> 02:14:51.318]  They're thinking of nothing but themselves.
[02:14:51.318 --> 02:14:53.840]  That's why they're politicians.
[02:14:53.840 --> 02:15:02.506]  And any adult that believes a politician is going to look out for their benefit really has to have their head examined.
[02:15:02.506 --> 02:15:04.568]  Ronald Reagan said it best.
[02:15:04.568 --> 02:15:06.930]  He said they're the second-oldest profession.
[02:15:07.651 --> 02:15:14.175]  But at least with the first all this profession you end up with a happy ending.
[02:15:14.175 --> 02:15:23.382]  So what we're looking at here is they don't care where the economy's going as long as they continue to live in the style that they've been accustomed to.
[02:15:23.382 --> 02:15:25.363]  These are not smart
[02:15:25.839 --> 02:15:28.461]  People, listen to the words.
[02:15:28.461 --> 02:15:35.546]  They always talk about Obama, for example, being, quote, a brilliant politician.
[02:15:35.546 --> 02:15:36.327]  That's it.
[02:15:36.327 --> 02:15:38.289]  That's as far as it goes.
[02:15:38.289 --> 02:15:41.171]  Hillary Clinton, a politician.
[02:15:41.171 --> 02:15:42.672]  They're politicians.
[02:15:43.172 --> 02:15:47.597]  Why don't people grow up and understand what they're going to get?
[02:15:47.597 --> 02:15:50.219]  They're going to get the shaft, and they're getting it.
[02:15:50.219 --> 02:16:04.573]  But again, after all this dies down, and they're pumping it up now with this two-bit nuclear summit that they just held, and they're waving the red flag at Iran.
[02:16:05.450 --> 02:16:12.485]  And by the way, the other one is going to be, we're most concerned about what's going to happen with Israel.
[02:16:12.485 --> 02:16:15.352]  That story jumped out of the news overnight.
[02:16:16.027 --> 02:16:38.427]  When they said that they were going to continue to build housing developments on occupied land, which is against the UN resolutions, against international law, they brushed it over, they did not, Netanyahu did not come to that nuclear summit, although Israel is alleged to have between 100 and 400 nuclear warheads,
[02:16:41.429 --> 02:16:57.401]  So we can see where we're leading here, and we believe that there's going to be something going on between Israel and Iran, that the United States is going to go into it with them, and when this happens, it's the beginning of the Great War.
[02:16:58.479 --> 02:17:05.843]  And by the way, Russian President Medvedev said two days ago to Haaretz, he said, Israel, don't attack Iran.
[02:17:05.843 --> 02:17:09.845]  This could cause World War III, a global catastrophe.
[02:17:09.845 --> 02:17:13.827]  And I've interviewed top former Pentagon and CIA analysts.
[02:17:13.827 --> 02:17:15.327]  I've read what the others are saying.
[02:17:15.327 --> 02:17:17.688]  It all runs from bad to worse.
[02:17:17.688 --> 02:17:24.132]  A huge regional war, oil prices tripling, our troops being attacked, depression.
[02:17:24.132 --> 02:17:26.453]  That's on the bad to the worse.
[02:17:27.153 --> 02:17:27.333]  Yeah.
[02:17:42.705 --> 02:17:46.368]  Hank Johnson, who believes that islands are floating and they may capsize.
[02:17:46.368 --> 02:17:49.210]  I mean, he's now set on record, though, he believes islands float.
[02:17:49.210 --> 02:17:55.675]  But you've also got the big banks and corporations, the White Shoe Boys, you talk about, who, I mean, they've taken over.
[02:17:55.675 --> 02:17:56.696]  They've stolen trillions.
[02:17:56.696 --> 02:17:57.596]  They're running things.
[02:17:57.596 --> 02:18:01.499]  I mean, they're, I mean, so there's also some smart ones in there.
[02:18:01.499 --> 02:18:11.487]  Of course, and you know that great quote, we have that one in the Trends Journal, which I know you know about, uh, Smedley Butler, the most decorated marine at the time in marine history,
[02:18:12.054 --> 02:18:24.078]  Calling war a racket, and he talks about how he doesn't want to fight anymore for the Brown Brothers, which is, you know, another, was another, uh, uh, uh, brokerage firm.
[02:18:24.078 --> 02:18:25.039]  That was the Bushes.
[02:18:25.039 --> 02:18:26.099]  And the banks.
[02:18:26.099 --> 02:18:27.480]  He talks about it.
[02:18:27.480 --> 02:18:30.581]  It's a racket, and that's what people have to know.
[02:18:31.081 --> 02:18:32.702]  The banks are robbing.
[02:18:32.702 --> 02:18:39.348]  It's the greatest bank robbery in American history, in world history, and the banks are doing the robbing.
[02:18:39.348 --> 02:18:41.570]  They could care less about us, Alex.
[02:18:41.570 --> 02:18:43.452]  They're money junkies.
[02:18:43.452 --> 02:18:46.754]  They're junkies, just like a junkie needs his heroin.
[02:18:46.754 --> 02:18:48.316]  They need their money.
[02:18:48.316 --> 02:18:49.837]  They never have enough.
[02:18:49.837 --> 02:18:51.899]  You look at that guy Buffett.
[02:18:51.899 --> 02:18:53.000]  I want more billions.
[02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:54.441]  I want more billions.
[02:18:54.441 --> 02:18:55.522]  When do you have enough?
[02:18:55.982 --> 02:18:56.963]  And that's what they're doing.
[02:18:56.963 --> 02:19:04.590]  The gap between the rich and the poor is the widest in the United States than any of the industrialized nations.
[02:19:04.590 --> 02:19:16.261]  We went from the most egalitarian post-World War II to now where only the rich have everything and the rest of us, we have to pay more taxes so they can get more.
[02:19:17.074 --> 02:19:23.263]  Exactly, and they're sicking the poor people on the dwindling middle class by saying the rich people is somebody who makes $200,000 a year.
[02:19:23.263 --> 02:19:27.991]  They're raising the taxes on the one group that's actually employing people.
[02:19:30.783 --> 02:19:39.386]  Let's talk about that.
[02:19:39.386 --> 02:19:44.667]  Gerald Cilente, when we come back, we're so honored to have you for two hours today, or almost two hours.
[02:19:44.667 --> 02:19:46.228]  Let's get into that new legislation.
[02:19:46.228 --> 02:19:47.048]  I'm glad you raised that.
[02:19:47.048 --> 02:19:50.609]  Then let's go back into how will they get their great war?
[02:19:50.609 --> 02:19:52.089]  How will they engineer it?
[02:19:52.089 --> 02:19:53.289]  How will they sell it?
[02:19:53.289 --> 02:19:55.170]  Will they let terrorists in with the nuke?
[02:19:55.170 --> 02:19:57.010]  Or will they stage the nuke attack?
[02:19:57.010 --> 02:19:58.651]  We'll be right back with Gerald Cilente.
[02:20:01.957 --> 02:20:02.538]  Fact.
[02:20:02.538 --> 02:20:03.879]  Four million people in the U.S.
[02:20:03.879 --> 02:20:06.001]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[02:20:06.001 --> 02:20:06.542]  Fact.
[02:20:06.542 --> 02:20:10.225]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the eighth leading cause of death among Americans.
[02:20:10.225 --> 02:20:10.846]  Fact.
[02:20:10.846 --> 02:20:16.351]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[02:20:16.351 --> 02:20:16.912]  Fact.
[02:20:16.912 --> 02:20:21.176]  One in ten Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[02:20:21.176 --> 02:20:21.756]  Fact.
[02:20:21.756 --> 02:20:25.460]  Anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.

[02:21:01.474 --> 02:21:03.797]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:21:03.797 --> 02:21:06.180]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:21:06.180 --> 02:21:09.383]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:21:09.383 --> 02:21:14.509]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:21:14.509 --> 02:21:18.694]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:21:18.994 --> 02:21:21.335]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:21:21.335 --> 02:21:24.237]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:21:24.237 --> 02:21:27.139]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:21:27.139 --> 02:21:34.743]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:21:35.083 --> 02:21:40.468]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:21:40.468 --> 02:21:43.331]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:21:43.331 --> 02:21:47.015]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:21:47.015 --> 02:21:48.096]  And I got news for you.
[02:21:48.096 --> 02:21:49.437]  You're everyone else.
[02:21:49.437 --> 02:21:50.918]  Invisible Empire.

[02:22:00.706 --> 02:22:10.730]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[02:22:10.730 --> 02:22:17.173]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[02:22:17.173 --> 02:22:26.017]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[02:22:26.397 --> 02:22:35.588]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[02:22:35.588 --> 02:22:40.653]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[02:22:40.653 --> 02:22:41.995]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:41.995 --> 02:22:44.498]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[02:22:44.778 --> 02:22:48.100]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[02:22:48.100 --> 02:22:52.283]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.

[02:22:53.023 --> 02:22:53.364]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.734 --> 02:23:06.541]  Did you know there is a growing number of researchers who agree that 90% of all disease begins in the colon?
[02:23:06.541 --> 02:23:11.767]  Did you know that 80% of all Americans suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[02:23:11.767 --> 02:23:14.631]  If allowed, our bodies are capable of healing themselves.
[02:23:14.631 --> 02:23:20.398]  The key to optimal health is not only what we eat, but also a healthy digestive system and a strong immune system.
[02:23:20.598 --> 02:23:29.741]  At Freshwater Organics, we offer FPP, a daily organic supplement that helps eliminate parasites, heavy metals, and high cholesterol naturally and safely.
[02:23:29.741 --> 02:23:37.463]  FPP, or fossilized phytoplankton powder, has been used worldwide for thousands of uses and is now available from Freshwater Organics.
[02:23:37.463 --> 02:23:44.885]  In addition, we offer an entire line of products to help cleanse waste and toxins, strengthen your immune system, and improve your overall well-being.

[02:24:07.546 --> 02:24:10.047]  This criminal takeover is so outrageous.
[02:24:10.047 --> 02:24:17.909]  I feel like just standing in front of a major bank that's a Federal Reserve shareholder and just screaming, they're robbing us, they're robbing us with a sign.
[02:24:17.909 --> 02:24:19.410]  That's what Gerald Salente is saying.
[02:24:19.410 --> 02:24:20.830]  It's so outrageous.
[02:24:20.830 --> 02:24:21.751]  There's a lot of anger.
[02:24:22.771 --> 02:24:24.532]  But it's not the level it should be.
[02:24:24.532 --> 02:24:25.932]  We'll talk about provocateurs.
[02:24:25.932 --> 02:24:27.573]  We've been covering this for a month.
[02:24:27.573 --> 02:24:32.455]  Now the AP admits the Democrats are infiltrating Tea Parties and posing as racists.
[02:24:32.455 --> 02:24:36.457]  They've been caught red-handed trying to false flag us.
[02:24:36.457 --> 02:24:46.201]  But Gerald, you were getting into how they're attacking any group or any system that allows us to be dependent on ourselves, not dependent on the system.
[02:24:46.201 --> 02:24:48.082]  They don't want us to be self-sufficient.
[02:24:49.025 --> 02:24:49.946]  Well, precisely.
[02:24:49.946 --> 02:24:50.687]  Look what happened.
[02:24:50.687 --> 02:25:05.008]  This country went from, you know, a nation of entrepreneurs, and when we were all about mom and pops and Main Street and family farms, we were the most egalitarian nation on earth.
[02:25:05.569 --> 02:25:12.037]  And now the level, the playing field has been changed that only the big guys get the big breaks.
[02:25:12.037 --> 02:25:16.982]  And as I mentioned, the gap between the rich and the poor is now the widest in the U.S.
[02:25:16.982 --> 02:25:19.645]  of any of the industrialized nations.
[02:25:19.645 --> 02:25:25.432]  So, for example, there's a big push going on now for people that want to buy local.
[02:25:25.772 --> 02:25:30.013]  They want to buy family farm foods.
[02:25:30.013 --> 02:25:49.060]  Well now they're pushing through legislation that's going to put a big burden on the family farms and they're bringing in the federal inspectors to make sure that they follow the regulations to a T as they turn a blind eye to the big guys.
[02:25:49.600 --> 02:25:52.541]  So now the main streets are deserted.
[02:25:52.541 --> 02:25:55.682]  We've seen what happened to the family farms.
[02:25:55.682 --> 02:26:00.184]  The trends are moving favorably back in those directions.
[02:26:00.184 --> 02:26:01.564]  And what are they doing?
[02:26:01.564 --> 02:26:03.465]  They're not going to let it happen.
[02:26:03.465 --> 02:26:06.186]  They're going to make sure that we become
[02:26:06.986 --> 02:26:09.989]  A service sector society.
[02:26:09.989 --> 02:26:11.511]  Think of the word.
[02:26:11.511 --> 02:26:12.892]  Servitude.
[02:26:12.892 --> 02:26:14.193]  Service.
[02:26:14.193 --> 02:26:14.934]  Serf.
[02:26:14.934 --> 02:26:17.056]  Hey, look at the great jobs!
[02:26:17.056 --> 02:26:21.941]  You wanna be a cashier at a 7-Eleven?
[02:26:21.941 --> 02:26:23.283]  Hey, I got one for you!
[02:26:23.723 --> 02:26:30.913]  How about working at Walmart's at 2 in the morning and crawling between shelves to stop them?
[02:26:30.913 --> 02:26:34.097]  That's what they're doing to the American public.
[02:26:34.097 --> 02:26:38.162]  And then they're going to take us to war when all else fails.
[02:26:38.162 --> 02:26:39.644]  Alright, we're going to get back into that.
[02:26:40.185 --> 02:26:42.126]  When we start the next segment, that's the key here.
[02:26:42.126 --> 02:26:47.107]  And I've got a whole host of issues I want to go through with the top trends forecaster in the world.
[02:26:47.107 --> 02:26:48.068]  Wrote the book on it.
[02:26:48.068 --> 02:26:50.968]  Stunning accuracy in his trends.
[02:26:50.968 --> 02:26:51.949]  Again, we're so honored to have him.
[02:26:51.949 --> 02:26:53.369]  TrendsResearch.com.
[02:26:53.369 --> 02:26:54.350]  Gerald Salente is his name.
[02:26:54.350 --> 02:26:55.370]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:26:55.370 --> 02:26:56.050]  If you just joined us.
[02:26:56.050 --> 02:26:58.311]  But I want to back you up on what you just said.
[02:26:58.311 --> 02:26:59.311]  Animal ID.
[02:26:59.311 --> 02:27:00.632]  Premises ID.
[02:27:00.632 --> 02:27:03.713]  On both sides of my family, I come from farmers and ranchers.
[02:27:03.713 --> 02:27:05.093]  They come in with regulations.
[02:27:05.093 --> 02:27:07.534]  They say you've got to have premises ID, animal ID.
[02:27:08.334 --> 02:27:13.956]  You've got to have a $14 tag per chicken in your small chicken coop.
[02:27:13.956 --> 02:27:19.937]  They have federal inspectors that the news admits are focused on small farms and small outfits.
[02:27:19.937 --> 02:27:21.458]  $14 tag per turkey.
[02:27:21.458 --> 02:27:30.340]  You can only sell the chicken for three, four bucks to one of the big groups, one of the big combines that processes them, but then Tyson Chicken is exempt
[02:27:30.520 --> 02:27:30.740]  I think?
[02:27:51.244 --> 02:27:54.646]  Everything by these globalists is economic warfare.
[02:27:54.646 --> 02:27:55.566]  Expanding on that.
[02:27:55.566 --> 02:27:58.287]  They're trying to shut down vitamins and mineral companies.
[02:27:58.287 --> 02:28:00.608]  Globally through the Codex Alimentarius.
[02:28:00.608 --> 02:28:03.990]  Any industry that's grassroots, they're coming after it.
[02:28:03.990 --> 02:28:04.610]  Exactly.
[02:28:04.610 --> 02:28:06.451]  It's squeeze the little guy.
[02:28:06.451 --> 02:28:08.312]  They're doing it with taxes.
[02:28:08.312 --> 02:28:10.773]  They're doing it with regulations.
[02:28:10.773 --> 02:28:11.654]  Look what happens.
[02:28:11.654 --> 02:28:14.375]  I mean, you see it all the time.
[02:28:14.375 --> 02:28:18.577]  They crush the small people for the smallest infraction.
[02:28:18.997 --> 02:28:23.218]  And they let the big guys get away with murder, literally.
[02:28:23.218 --> 02:28:25.979]  And look right here in New York State, it's great.
[02:28:25.979 --> 02:28:28.920]  We had Eliot Spitzer, the esteemed governor.
[02:28:28.920 --> 02:28:32.461]  You know, he was caught with a prostitute, remember?
[02:28:32.461 --> 02:28:34.062]  A couple of months back.
[02:28:34.062 --> 02:28:38.123]  And this is the guy that he was disgraced out of office.
[02:28:38.123 --> 02:28:44.885]  And this is the guy that wrote the rule that they would prosecute Johns that were caught with laws.
[02:28:44.885 --> 02:28:47.166]  He gets caught, they don't prosecute him.
[02:28:47.466 --> 02:28:50.008]  And now he has his own talk show!
[02:28:50.008 --> 02:28:52.330]  You couldn't do better than this one!
[02:28:52.330 --> 02:28:55.833]  The big get a free ride.
[02:28:55.833 --> 02:28:58.135]  This isn't America.
[02:28:58.135 --> 02:29:03.259]  This is France just before the reign of terror.
[02:29:03.259 --> 02:29:04.881]  Let them eat cake.
[02:29:04.881 --> 02:29:08.724]  They're pushing it right in everybody's face.
[02:29:08.724 --> 02:29:14.389]  We cannot see it more blatantly done than the way they're doing it every day.
[02:29:15.976 --> 02:29:17.356]  And there's a method to the madness.
[02:29:17.356 --> 02:29:19.417]  They want to push us into armed rebellion.
[02:29:19.417 --> 02:29:25.359]  They're involved in these militias and everywhere else trying to provocateur us into violence.
[02:29:25.359 --> 02:29:29.841]  We'll talk about where Joel Solente sees the domestic situation going.
[02:29:29.841 --> 02:29:31.081]  What is the breaking point?
[02:29:31.081 --> 02:29:33.362]  Where will there be physical revolution?
[02:29:33.362 --> 02:29:36.663]  Why is the system trying to kick that off early?
[02:29:36.663 --> 02:29:38.324]  It's not so they can nip it in the bud.
[02:29:38.324 --> 02:29:42.345]  But first, the march to the Third World War.
[02:29:42.725 --> 02:29:44.887]  It's not just Gerald Salente saying that.
[02:29:44.887 --> 02:29:48.209]  Other world leaders are saying this could be the start of World War III.
[02:29:48.209 --> 02:29:51.611]  By design, stay with us.
[02:29:51.611 --> 02:29:53.012]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.012 --> 02:29:55.534]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.534 --> 02:29:58.216]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.351 --> 02:30:02.512]  What's your home worth?
[02:30:02.512 --> 02:30:04.634]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[02:30:04.634 --> 02:30:07.677]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[02:30:07.677 --> 02:30:15.405]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[02:31:00.825 --> 02:31:03.147]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:31:03.147 --> 02:31:05.529]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:31:05.529 --> 02:31:08.732]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:31:08.732 --> 02:31:13.856]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:31:13.856 --> 02:31:18.040]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:31:18.340 --> 02:31:20.802]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:31:20.802 --> 02:31:23.245]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:31:23.245 --> 02:31:26.488]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:31:26.488 --> 02:31:34.095]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:31:34.435 --> 02:31:39.816]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:31:39.816 --> 02:31:42.137]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:31:42.137 --> 02:31:46.358]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:31:46.358 --> 02:31:48.778]  And I got news for you, you're everyone else.
[02:31:48.778 --> 02:31:50.259]  Invisible Empire.

[02:32:00.748 --> 02:32:02.049]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:32:02.049 --> 02:32:07.636]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:32:07.636 --> 02:32:12.661]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:32:12.661 --> 02:32:17.687]  It's true, seeds had outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:32:18.227 --> 02:32:23.451]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:32:23.451 --> 02:32:25.753]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[02:32:25.753 --> 02:32:30.557]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:32:30.557 --> 02:32:31.678]  And here's the best part.
[02:32:31.678 --> 02:32:34.760]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:32:34.760 --> 02:32:38.043]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:32:38.363 --> 02:32:41.545]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:32:41.545 --> 02:32:43.766]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:32:43.766 --> 02:32:44.706]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:32:44.706 --> 02:32:44.906]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:32:44.906 --> 02:32:48.348]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:32:48.348 --> 02:32:50.089]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:33:03.868 --> 02:33:04.789]  We are back live.
[02:33:04.789 --> 02:33:09.112]  We're going to go through issue after issue with Gerald Solente, interspersed with your phone calls.
[02:33:09.112 --> 02:33:17.579]  Tripp, Justin, Ron, Scott, Joe, and others that are holding the toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[02:33:17.579 --> 02:33:19.440]  I got two sponsors I want to tell you about.
[02:33:19.440 --> 02:33:28.687]  You'll notice all of our sponsors are about empowering the individual, empowering the family, and supporting Made in America, like Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:33:28.687 --> 02:33:30.709]  I'm a Levi's man, but not anymore.
[02:33:30.709 --> 02:33:31.570]  They're made in Mexico.
[02:33:34.062 --> 02:33:36.963]  They keep ripping, the crotches keep ripping out of them.
[02:33:36.963 --> 02:33:39.584]  I mean, I pick up a box, put it in the back of my car, they rip.
[02:33:39.584 --> 02:33:40.304]  They're junk.
[02:33:40.304 --> 02:33:42.004]  I won't be buying any more Levi's.
[02:33:42.004 --> 02:33:44.485]  I love Diamond Gusset, made in America.
[02:33:44.485 --> 02:33:48.026]  The fabric, they're put together, 100% made in America.
[02:33:48.026 --> 02:33:51.927]  Diamond Gusset jeans, gussetclothing.com.
[02:33:51.927 --> 02:33:56.209]  That's gusset, G-U-S-S-E-T, clothing.com.
[02:33:56.209 --> 02:34:00.150]  You've heard their jingle that is very, very
[02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:02.521]  Addictive.
[02:34:02.521 --> 02:34:05.086]  Everyone's singing it around the office.
[02:34:05.086 --> 02:34:06.328]  Seriously, we are.
[02:34:06.328 --> 02:34:08.411]  GussetClothing.com.
[02:34:08.411 --> 02:34:09.834]  Made in America.
[02:34:09.834 --> 02:34:13.741]  They've got motorcycle jeans, regular jeans, everything at...
[02:34:15.253 --> 02:34:17.555]  Guys at Clothing.com.
[02:34:17.555 --> 02:34:20.558]  And another sponsor, SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:34:20.558 --> 02:34:28.364]  I mean, even if you've got some tomatoes and squash and stuff like that growing in your backyard, and peppers, humans naturally do this.
[02:34:28.364 --> 02:34:31.967]  My kids could spend 10 hours outside just watering and playing with our garden.
[02:34:31.967 --> 02:34:34.530]  We just put in a garden in the back and we do it every year.
[02:34:34.530 --> 02:34:35.390]  The springtime's here.
[02:34:36.391 --> 02:34:42.334]  So buy one Survival Seed Bank, non-GMO, non-hybrid, and plant it, and buy another one, and save it.
[02:34:42.334 --> 02:34:46.677]  But you can also, because it's non-hybrid, non-GMO, you can replant the seeds that you get out this year.
[02:34:46.677 --> 02:34:48.478]  This is what humans are meant to do.
[02:34:48.478 --> 02:34:49.759]  And they're a great sponsor.
[02:34:49.759 --> 02:34:53.521]  SurvivalSeedBank.com, or give them a call, 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365, SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:34:53.521 --> 02:34:55.442]  And of course, information is important as well.
[02:34:55.442 --> 02:34:56.823]  Be sure and visit TrendsResearch.com.
[02:34:56.823 --> 02:34:57.063]  Okay, Gerald,
[02:35:05.948 --> 02:35:13.796]  I want to start going to calls in the next segment and then back into trends in the next hour, but I'm going to try to shut up here and just ask quick questions but with key points.
[02:35:13.796 --> 02:35:15.938]  I know governments have staged terror.
[02:35:15.938 --> 02:35:18.160]  I know Operation Northwoods is an official U.S.
[02:35:18.160 --> 02:35:20.783]  government plan to stage 9-11 style attacks.
[02:35:20.783 --> 02:35:29.831]  I don't put it past these bankers, this isn't our government anymore, these corporate mafia, from staging a dirty bomb or even a nuke or busting somebody in a fake attack.
[02:35:30.632 --> 02:35:32.474]  Imagine the clampdown they could have.
[02:35:32.474 --> 02:35:41.501]  The only way I see them being able to launch their war on Iran, which they're now trying to blame suitcase nukes on, is a massive crisis.
[02:35:41.501 --> 02:35:45.465]  We've already been lied to about fictitious WMDs in Iraq once.
[02:35:45.465 --> 02:35:47.686]  Now they're just coming back with the same story.
[02:35:47.686 --> 02:35:49.868]  But I do see them staging terror.
[02:35:49.868 --> 02:35:52.590]  I've seen them hyping that the Tea Parties are violent.
[02:35:52.590 --> 02:35:56.334]  They've been caught planting people in there, even in the AP now, yesterday.
[02:35:56.994 --> 02:36:01.656]  Everything I see them do is false flag, set-ups, frame-ups.
[02:36:01.656 --> 02:36:08.420]  How do you see them getting us into a war, which the Rand Corporation said two years ago they need to build their New World Order?
[02:36:09.741 --> 02:36:15.462]  Well, we believe Iran is going to be the target.
[02:36:15.462 --> 02:36:23.924]  The other one is there really may be a terror strike, legitimately, coming out of Pakistan.
[02:36:23.924 --> 02:36:25.884]  This should be the major news.
[02:36:25.884 --> 02:36:33.306]  Every day, virtually, they're sending predator drones in and killing scores of innocent people.
[02:36:33.306 --> 02:36:37.727]  I believe the number is well over a thousand now in the last year.
[02:36:38.947 --> 02:36:41.929]  This is as old as the Old Testament.
[02:36:41.929 --> 02:36:44.031]  It's an eye for an eye.
[02:36:44.031 --> 02:36:50.815]  You have the greatest refugee crisis going on in Pakistan since Rwanda.
[02:36:50.815 --> 02:36:54.458]  And they're escalating that war even more.
[02:36:54.458 --> 02:36:59.401]  And of course the CIA is behind sending these drones in.
[02:36:59.401 --> 02:37:05.585]  Since when was the CIA supposed to be in the battle like this?
[02:37:06.065 --> 02:37:09.408]  I thought they were only there to collect intelligence.
[02:37:09.408 --> 02:37:17.596]  So we're really looking at something, Alex, where we have well over 200,000 Pakistanis in this country.
[02:37:17.596 --> 02:37:20.719]  They're watching their families get murdered.
[02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:24.323]  You think they're going to be angry?
[02:37:24.323 --> 02:37:29.989]  They're going to say when terrorists strike, they hate our freedom and liberty.
[02:37:29.989 --> 02:37:35.955]  How about they hate your foreign policy, and they hate you for killing innocent people.
[02:37:35.955 --> 02:37:40.099]  Look what happened in Afghanistan two days ago.
[02:37:40.099 --> 02:37:42.741]  They strafed the passenger bus!
[02:37:43.402 --> 02:37:46.245]  There's plenty of hatred out there.
[02:37:46.245 --> 02:37:55.074]  False flag or real, we're forecasting in 2010 a 9-11 magnitude terrorist strike.
[02:37:55.074 --> 02:38:00.120]  And we're saying this as well so people can take proactive measures.
[02:38:00.580 --> 02:38:01.741]  What does it mean?
[02:38:01.741 --> 02:38:14.970]  Well, it means the things that you're talking about on your show, the products, the survival products, and it means having gold to us, but it also means what happened after 9-11.
[02:38:14.970 --> 02:38:17.792]  They shut the Wall Street down.
[02:38:17.792 --> 02:38:30.320]  I couldn't cash in my CDs because I wanted to get away from here because Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant is just north of 9-11, of Ground Zero, and I'm just north of that.
[02:38:30.980 --> 02:38:37.346]  So when I went to get my CDs, I couldn't get them out because Wall Street was closed their financial instruments.
[02:38:37.346 --> 02:38:44.473]  This time, when 9-11 magnitude terrorist strikes, we forecast they're going to close the banks.
[02:38:44.473 --> 02:38:47.116]  You're not going to be able to get your money out.
[02:38:47.116 --> 02:38:51.039]  And there's going to be cyber attacks as well.
[02:38:51.039 --> 02:38:55.263]  And when you do get your money out, the little bit they'll let you take out at a time,
[02:38:56.124 --> 02:39:05.535]  It's going to be devalued, just like they devalued it under FDR when they called a bank holiday, just like they devalued it in Argentina.
[02:39:05.535 --> 02:39:07.417]  They'll devalue it again.
[02:39:07.417 --> 02:39:15.406]  That's one of the ways they're going to try to get out of this financial mountain of debt that's bringing down the nation.
[02:39:15.406 --> 02:39:16.567]  And just to back you up,
[02:39:17.543 --> 02:39:20.984]  We see Citibank and the other big banks saying, well, hold your money for seven days.
[02:39:20.984 --> 02:39:22.244]  We see Bloomberg.
[02:39:22.244 --> 02:39:25.785]  Federal regulators are ordering public and private pension funds.
[02:39:25.785 --> 02:39:29.006]  Since when can you do that in a free country to invest in failed banks?
[02:39:29.006 --> 02:39:29.547]  That's a quote.
[02:39:29.547 --> 02:39:32.067]  In fact, print me the Bloomberg or Businessweek again.
[02:39:32.067 --> 02:39:35.868]  It actually says, and now Argentina just took their pension funds.
[02:39:35.868 --> 02:39:37.989]  Greece is talking about taking their pension funds.
[02:39:37.989 --> 02:39:43.411]  They tried to take the Icelandic pension funds, but the people rioted for a year and said no.
[02:39:45.311 --> 02:39:46.232]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:39:46.232 --> 02:39:48.533]  They're openly saying they're going to take the pension funds.
[02:39:48.533 --> 02:39:59.739]  The cybersecurity bill passed the House, now in the Senate, says for any emergency, including financial, the president can, quote, shut down the internet or selectively shut down the web.
[02:39:59.739 --> 02:40:02.440]  We see internet censorship passing in Italy.
[02:40:02.440 --> 02:40:03.701]  We see it passing in France.
[02:40:03.701 --> 02:40:06.202]  We see it passing last week in England.
[02:40:06.202 --> 02:40:11.885]  We see national publications mainly singling me out, saying I'm calling for violence when I'm not.
[02:40:12.205 --> 02:40:38.742]  Calling for censoring us I mean so clearly you can see them lining everything up and getting ready for a war as a political distraction But the real enemy is us fleecing us further and like a bully sitting on our chest pounding us in the face breaking our will So the criminal Madoff's and and Ken Lay types that run our society They're trying to go for broke and then make sure they can protect themselves from the people
[02:40:39.818 --> 02:40:40.339]  Exactly.
[02:40:40.339 --> 02:40:43.081]  Like I said, these are nothing more than money junkies.
[02:40:43.081 --> 02:40:44.883]  They can't get enough.
[02:40:44.883 --> 02:40:46.445]  Just like a heroin addict.
[02:40:46.445 --> 02:40:50.509]  They have no bounds, no boundaries, no loyalties.
[02:40:50.509 --> 02:40:53.572]  They'll do anything to get their money fixed.
[02:40:53.572 --> 02:40:55.714]  And that's what's going on now.
[02:40:55.714 --> 02:41:00.539]  And then the other ones, the politicians, they need their power fixed.
[02:41:00.879 --> 02:41:03.360]  So it's a perfect group.
[02:41:03.360 --> 02:41:07.722]  They're the gang, and they are destroying this nation.
[02:41:07.722 --> 02:41:14.825]  And as we've said before, people railing about, oh, nationalism and socialism, it's fascism.
[02:41:14.825 --> 02:41:17.366]  The merger of state and corporate powers.
[02:41:17.366 --> 02:41:19.767]  Oh, here's a beauty for you today.
[02:41:19.767 --> 02:41:22.568]  You know this private equity firm?
[02:41:23.448 --> 02:41:24.809]  Siribus.
[02:41:24.809 --> 02:41:30.994]  They own Chrysler and they also own 51% of GMAC.
[02:41:30.994 --> 02:41:38.861]  And this private equity group, the chairman and CEO is Jon Snow.
[02:41:38.861 --> 02:41:42.063]  He was the Treasury Secretary before
[02:41:43.086 --> 02:41:45.127]  Hank Paulson on the Bush.
[02:41:45.127 --> 02:41:53.290]  One of the Board of Directors is that brilliant, shining light of intelligence and integrity, Dan Quayle.
[02:41:53.290 --> 02:41:58.733]  Well, today it was announced that Syribus just bought DynCorp.
[02:41:58.733 --> 02:42:00.973]  You know those mercenaries?
[02:42:00.973 --> 02:42:04.155]  Those soldiers of the Fortune 500?
[02:42:04.155 --> 02:42:06.336]  Those military contractors?
[02:42:07.156 --> 02:42:08.817]  That's what's going on.
[02:42:08.817 --> 02:42:10.658]  We bail out Chrysler.
[02:42:10.658 --> 02:42:13.139]  We bail out GMAC.
[02:42:13.139 --> 02:42:15.400]  And what do they do with that money?
[02:42:15.400 --> 02:42:18.442]  They buy another piece of the war.
[02:42:18.442 --> 02:42:19.682]  It's a racket.
[02:42:19.682 --> 02:42:21.163]  Just follow the names.
[02:42:21.163 --> 02:42:24.605]  I've said this over and over and I'll say it again.
[02:42:24.605 --> 02:42:32.409]  If the names on Wall Street were named Solenti, Caruso, Mondavi, Puccini, Rossini, they'd call it the Mafia.
[02:42:33.129 --> 02:42:39.693]  But when you call it Dan Quayle and Jon Snow and Hank Paulson, oh no!
[02:42:39.693 --> 02:42:47.358]  They're just public servants and really, really swell financial geniuses.
[02:42:47.358 --> 02:42:53.021]  Well, Gerald Cilente had Catherine Austen Fitch, you know, high-level former federal officer.
[02:42:53.021 --> 02:42:56.043]  Brilliant woman.
[02:42:56.043 --> 02:42:56.964]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:42:56.964 --> 02:42:58.525]  Headed up HUD.
[02:42:58.525 --> 02:42:59.866]  And when she discovered all of this,
[02:43:00.962 --> 02:43:09.184]  And she said, Alex, you had a show on about CPS taking people's kids, and you didn't know, and she sent us the documents and mainstream news articles.
[02:43:09.184 --> 02:43:10.425]  I mean, I don't know everything.
[02:43:10.425 --> 02:43:11.245]  In fact, I don't know much.
[02:43:11.245 --> 02:43:13.906]  The more I learn, the more I know how much I don't know.
[02:43:13.906 --> 02:43:20.087]  I didn't know DynCorp, its biggest business in the U.S., is running CPS.
[02:43:20.087 --> 02:43:26.309]  So the counties and cities stealing people's kids without due process and then selling them off literally to adoption agencies.
[02:43:28.499 --> 02:43:31.722]  Once I found out about it, I googled searched it, there were thousands of articles.
[02:43:31.722 --> 02:43:39.729]  DynCorp is now not just running white slavery rings, as the Chicago Tribune reported a few years ago, overseas, in Serbia.
[02:43:39.729 --> 02:43:41.131]  They're here running it.
[02:43:41.131 --> 02:43:46.576]  So now these Pentagon groups are literally hunting us and our children, and I didn't even know it!
[02:43:46.576 --> 02:43:47.777]  Think of what else I don't know!
[02:43:49.136 --> 02:43:55.541]  And you know, before we were talking about how they're clamping down on the little people regulations.
[02:43:55.541 --> 02:44:03.108]  Oh, they just came out with the latest IRS reports and how they're not going after big corporations.
[02:44:03.108 --> 02:44:03.608]  That's right.
[02:44:03.608 --> 02:44:06.430]  They're going after the little people.
[02:44:06.430 --> 02:44:10.334]  Don't the people see what's going on over here?
[02:44:10.334 --> 02:44:14.137]  They're going to crush the rebellion before it starts.
[02:44:14.617 --> 02:44:16.660]  We're making it really clear.
[02:44:16.660 --> 02:44:19.785]  We're calling for an intellectual revolution.
[02:44:19.785 --> 02:44:22.008]  One of the minds, not guns.
[02:44:22.008 --> 02:44:25.193]  Because you're not gonna outgun these guys.
[02:44:25.193 --> 02:44:30.560]  And anybody that thinks they are or they're out of their minds, they'll crush you like a net.
[02:44:31.081 --> 02:44:35.104]  We won a revolution in this country before with mines.
[02:44:35.104 --> 02:44:36.325]  We could win it again.
[02:44:36.325 --> 02:44:40.148]  And that's what we're saying that can't happen.
[02:44:40.148 --> 02:44:43.070]  You know, it's that 20% solution.
[02:44:43.070 --> 02:44:53.938]  It's the people that will not follow the deranged that want to turn them into murderers to fight other wars that say, no, we're going to stop.
[02:44:54.398 --> 02:45:04.474]  And if we stop these wars and we start concentrating and bringing the resources back to this country, we can rebuild it step by step.
[02:45:05.899 --> 02:45:07.020]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:45:07.020 --> 02:45:07.501]  Here it is.
[02:45:07.501 --> 02:45:11.166]  Failed banks may get pension fund backing as FDIC seeks cash.
[02:45:11.166 --> 02:45:12.547]  Business Week.
[02:45:12.547 --> 02:45:14.089]  And this is now all over the news.
[02:45:14.089 --> 02:45:16.292]  It was in the London Telegraph yesterday.
[02:45:16.292 --> 02:45:24.522]  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corps is trying to encourage public retirement funds that control more than $2 trillion to buy all are part of failed lenders.
[02:45:25.063 --> 02:45:30.328]  So the big banks move their money out the back door and buy real assets, then they put the public on the hook.
[02:45:30.328 --> 02:45:36.433]  So all these cops and people being replaced by DynCorp now to snatch kids, they're going to take your pension funds.
[02:45:36.433 --> 02:45:43.079]  And it goes on to say the government is ordering the pension funds to invest in failed banks.
[02:45:43.079 --> 02:45:45.501]  Since when in the land of the free, home of the brave,
[02:45:46.101 --> 02:45:51.145]  Does the government regulators order the pension funds where to put their money?
[02:45:51.145 --> 02:45:52.666]  Well, it's all selectively enforced.
[02:45:52.666 --> 02:45:54.067]  I want to back you up here.
[02:45:54.067 --> 02:45:59.691]  If they don't, the laws, millions of laws, there's millions, are written where nobody can follow the law.
[02:45:59.691 --> 02:46:02.433]  It's all selectively enforced, so they'll go in and shut them down.
[02:46:02.433 --> 02:46:05.655]  That's what Catherine Austen Fitch said and agreed with me here last week.
[02:46:05.655 --> 02:46:10.018]  But then, you talked about the articles in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times.
[02:46:10.899 --> 02:46:28.928]  In the last year that I've seen, where not only have they cut almost all of the white-collar investigators off of big banks, big corporations that pay almost no tax, it's reported, but when they do bust a Swiss bank account and make it big news in Reuters today, it was for $200,000.
[02:46:28.928 --> 02:46:32.509]  So they're busting little bitty chump level.
[02:46:32.509 --> 02:46:39.793]  That sounds a lot to a McDonald's worker, but that's nothing, you know, to the elite who are in the trillions and hundreds of billions individually in some cases.
[02:46:40.473 --> 02:46:54.459]  And then I remember reading articles about now they're not even having them go after upper middle class, it's after blue-collar, people $35,000, and that they send two uniformed officers to Sacramento to a guy's car wash that hadn't paid four cents.
[02:46:54.459 --> 02:46:55.279]  In fact, pull that up.
[02:46:55.279 --> 02:47:00.802]  It was two or four cents, Sacramento B. A car wash visit over two cents.
[02:47:00.802 --> 02:47:02.982]  And they threatened him over two cents.
[02:47:02.982 --> 02:47:06.344]  Again, they've got the few investigators going after people for two cents.
[02:47:07.244 --> 02:47:08.744]  Well, the same thing here in New York.
[02:47:08.744 --> 02:47:14.646]  They're busting people to go into beauty parlors to get all the sales tax they can.
[02:47:14.646 --> 02:47:16.306]  Little cafe owners.
[02:47:16.306 --> 02:47:21.368]  They're cracking down on the little people and they have the goon squads behind them.
[02:47:21.368 --> 02:47:25.509]  There's a lot of things going on right now that people should be watching around the world.
[02:47:26.209 --> 02:47:28.132]  And one of them, of course, is Greece.
[02:47:28.132 --> 02:47:29.754]  This is just the beginning.
[02:47:29.754 --> 02:47:34.781]  We could actually see the breakup of the European Monetary Union.
[02:47:34.781 --> 02:47:37.965]  There's going to be countries that aren't going to be able to cut it.
[02:47:37.965 --> 02:47:41.650]  But also, look at the riots going on in Thailand.
[02:47:41.650 --> 02:47:43.072]  Look what's going on in Kyrgyzstan.
[02:47:44.073 --> 02:47:48.555]  Look what's going on in Latvia, Lithuania, the Ukraine.
[02:47:48.555 --> 02:47:52.277]  The seeds of war are already fermenting.
[02:47:52.277 --> 02:47:53.518]  They're blossoming.
[02:47:53.518 --> 02:47:55.319]  They're coming up from the ground.
[02:47:55.319 --> 02:47:56.860]  Look what happened in Hungary.
[02:47:56.860 --> 02:48:00.261]  Again, people should really take a global view.
[02:48:00.261 --> 02:48:09.426]  They just brought in a very right-wing government, and the neo-Nazi party, they just got almost 20% of the vote.
[02:48:11.207 --> 02:48:15.790]  So we're going to start seeing some real backlashes going on.
[02:48:15.790 --> 02:48:24.054]  And the other thing that we're forecasting is that when the stimulus money runs out, the crash is going to happen.
[02:48:24.054 --> 02:48:27.116]  And we believe it's going to be a currency crash.
[02:48:27.116 --> 02:48:32.679]  And again, look what's going on in Europe, and they're covering it up.
[02:48:32.679 --> 02:48:35.161]  It's much worse than they're making it seem.
[02:48:35.161 --> 02:48:37.082]  Even with Greece, and you go back to
[02:48:37.842 --> 02:48:43.865]  In December of 2009, a couple of months ago, they said, oh, don't worry about it.
[02:48:43.865 --> 02:48:46.667]  The Greece problem is not going to be a big one.
[02:48:46.667 --> 02:48:47.747]  We can take care of it.
[02:48:47.747 --> 02:48:50.008]  Well, they just broke the rules.
[02:48:50.008 --> 02:48:55.971]  They said they would never, under the Maastricht Agreement, bail out a failed country.
[02:48:55.971 --> 02:48:57.572]  And now they're doing it.
[02:48:57.572 --> 02:49:02.615]  So the entire systems are failing and people better plan for the worst.
[02:49:04.602 --> 02:49:06.983]  And a correction, there's CBS News.
[02:49:06.983 --> 02:49:08.923]  We'll throw it back up on screen.
[02:49:08.923 --> 02:49:13.004]  Sacramento car wash gets IRS visit over four cents.
[02:49:13.004 --> 02:49:14.164]  I was going for memory.
[02:49:14.164 --> 02:49:16.065]  I'm sorry, it was over a lot more money.
[02:49:16.065 --> 02:49:17.485]  It was four cents.
[02:49:17.485 --> 02:49:22.286]  Imagine sending the IRS to threaten someone over four cents.
[02:49:22.286 --> 02:49:24.306]  What are these IRS agents thinking?
[02:49:24.306 --> 02:49:27.487]  They can't go after Bernie Madoff, but they can go after somebody with four cents.
[02:49:28.490 --> 02:49:30.051]  Well, again, that's the whole system.
[02:49:30.051 --> 02:49:31.532]  It's the cops crashing down.
[02:49:31.532 --> 02:49:41.338]  Look, if you have two glasses of wine and they stop you, they'll throw you against the car and handcuff you and send you to jail.
[02:49:41.338 --> 02:49:42.599]  I mean, come on!
[02:49:42.599 --> 02:49:44.680]  It's squeezed the little people.
[02:49:45.100 --> 02:49:51.464]  This is classic when an empire is in decline, and America is that declining empire.
[02:49:51.464 --> 02:49:54.446]  So that's what happens, and that's why revolts begin.
[02:49:54.446 --> 02:50:06.813]  As you said, they have the agents provocateur that they keep putting in, whether it's a peaceful demonstration, and all of a sudden you see a squad of guys coming out, and they call them anarchists with masks on.
[02:50:06.813 --> 02:50:07.714]  And who are they?
[02:50:08.254 --> 02:50:14.977]  They're the police, and they're making it look as though it's the average person that's causing the damage.
[02:50:14.977 --> 02:50:19.819]  And the same thing as you pointed out, the infiltrators of these tea parties.
[02:50:19.819 --> 02:50:26.662]  So we're really in a very crucial time right now, and we could go either way, but unquestionably,
[02:50:27.322 --> 02:50:32.584]  After this stimulus high runs out, the economy is going to crash.
[02:50:32.584 --> 02:50:41.028]  They're going to try to keep it alive for the 2010 midterm elections, but after that, it's going to fall apart.
[02:50:41.028 --> 02:50:45.010]  But we're forecasting, actually, it may happen even before then.
[02:50:45.450 --> 02:50:46.151]  You're saying before 2010.
[02:50:46.151 --> 02:50:47.291]  Stay there.
[02:50:47.291 --> 02:50:52.735]  We're going to come back, get into your forecast on the economy, and then take phone calls.
[02:50:52.735 --> 02:50:55.117]  A whole other hour of Geraldo Salente coming up.
[02:50:55.117 --> 02:50:56.779]  He's been very gracious with us.
[02:50:56.779 --> 02:50:57.979]  We're very, very thankful.
[02:50:57.979 --> 02:50:58.380]  Stay with us.
[02:51:01.765 --> 02:51:09.032]  UtopiaSilver.com believes, as the Declaration of Independence states, that our rights come from God, not from government.
[02:51:09.032 --> 02:51:18.221]  The only lawful purpose of any government is to protect and secure the rights of the people, and no man or government has the authority to take what has been given to us by God.
[02:51:18.221 --> 02:51:21.404]  Among these rights are life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:51:21.664 --> 02:51:26.809]  And America's government has ceased to be the protector of liberty and of the people's God-given rights.
[02:51:26.809 --> 02:51:34.015]  But we, the people, can return America to greatness if we are willing to stand up and reassert our stolen rights.
[02:51:34.015 --> 02:51:37.978]  We ask that you join Utopia Silver in changing America's course in history.

[02:52:03.811 --> 02:52:06.131]  We are part of a new world order.
[02:52:06.131 --> 02:52:09.352]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[02:52:09.352 --> 02:52:14.453]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:14.453 --> 02:52:18.634]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.954 --> 02:52:21.415]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:21.415 --> 02:52:24.197]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:24.197 --> 02:52:27.119]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:27.119 --> 02:52:34.703]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:35.043 --> 02:52:40.405]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:40.405 --> 02:52:43.285]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:43.285 --> 02:52:46.986]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:46.986 --> 02:52:48.067]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:48.067 --> 02:52:49.387]  You're everyone else.

[02:53:13.291 --> 02:53:14.552]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:53:14.552 --> 02:53:16.754]  The IRS isn't going to just forget about you.
[02:53:16.754 --> 02:53:21.938]  Right now, the IRS is hiring thousands of tax collectors to go after delinquent accounts just like yours.
[02:53:21.938 --> 02:53:24.600]  That's why you need to take action today, and I can help.

[02:53:54.417 --> 02:53:54.858]  That's 800-34... No tax.
[02:54:06.621 --> 02:54:18.284]  The AP reported yesterday, several weeks after our initial investigation, that groups all over the country are infiltrating the Tea Parties to pose as racist and do other things.
[02:54:18.284 --> 02:54:23.405]  Well, here is a Braverton teacher who faces investigation over Tea Party infiltration.
[02:54:23.405 --> 02:54:26.526]  He also has a company that supplies much of the city with their internet.
[02:54:28.396 --> 02:54:29.877]  And I've said this is racketeering.
[02:54:29.877 --> 02:54:40.604]  You try to go to peaceful political protest and make them look like kooks or make them look like racists, as other groups are saying they're going to do, or try to cause violence, as other groups are saying, that's racketeering.
[02:54:40.604 --> 02:54:45.166]  That's organized crime getting together to go set people up.
[02:54:45.166 --> 02:54:51.330]  And the black congressional caucus walked out in the Tea Party, tried to get them to spit on them, tried to get them to call them the N-word.
[02:54:51.330 --> 02:54:52.451]  Nobody did that.
[02:54:52.451 --> 02:54:53.712]  The media ran with it and lied.
[02:54:54.272 --> 02:54:56.554]  This is the type of propaganda we're talking about.
[02:54:56.554 --> 02:54:57.855]  Gerald Cilente is our guest.
[02:54:57.855 --> 02:55:05.441]  Your call is coming up right when we start the next hour, and I've got other questions we're going to intersperse throughout that for Gerald Cilente, picking his brain here.
[02:55:05.441 --> 02:55:07.243]  TrendsResearch.com.
[02:55:07.243 --> 02:55:11.246]  Don't forget, we've got two new films coming out in the next week.
[02:55:11.246 --> 02:55:13.888]  One tomorrow premieres at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:55:13.888 --> 02:55:18.492]  The DVDs of the new film, Invisible Empire, New World Order Defined, are now shipping.
[02:55:18.492 --> 02:55:21.234]  Check out the trailers and info at InfoWars.com.
[02:55:21.234 --> 02:55:21.755]  Okay, Gerald,
[02:55:23.190 --> 02:55:26.175]  Talking about the economy going under.
[02:55:26.175 --> 02:55:31.644]  A. I know you can't put an exact date on it, but a danger zone.
[02:55:31.644 --> 02:55:33.767]  A. B. Is there a way to stop it?
[02:55:33.767 --> 02:55:37.473]  And C. When they implode it, what type of things are they going to try to steal?
[02:55:39.094 --> 02:55:46.859]  The timing is very tough, but we're looking for something really to happen between now and September.
[02:55:46.859 --> 02:55:49.480]  That's our window.
[02:55:49.480 --> 02:55:59.346]  Because you're going to start seeing a lot more commercial real estate collapsing, you're going to start seeing more sovereign debt problems, and they're not going to be able to cover it up anymore.
[02:55:59.346 --> 02:56:01.907]  And of course the Fed is winding back on their
[02:56:04.060 --> 02:56:08.684]  1.5 trillion that they're covering this whole housing bubble with.
[02:56:08.684 --> 02:56:11.086]  And that's winding down as well.
[02:56:11.086 --> 02:56:16.652]  So we're gonna start seeing some very bad sales coming out in real estate as well.
[02:56:16.652 --> 02:56:18.774]  How can it be stopped?
[02:56:18.774 --> 02:56:21.757]  It can be stopped only a couple of ways.
[02:56:21.757 --> 02:56:22.277]  One is that
[02:56:23.579 --> 02:56:26.440]  We have to start doing business with each other.
[02:56:26.440 --> 02:56:29.361]  We're a country of over 300 million people.
[02:56:29.361 --> 02:56:31.102]  Buy American!
[02:56:31.102 --> 02:56:35.804]  And I'm not a protectionist, and I'm certainly not an isolationist.
[02:56:35.804 --> 02:56:37.244]  I travel the world.
[02:56:37.244 --> 02:56:41.286]  But I also have to support my neighbor, and my neighbors support me.
[02:56:41.286 --> 02:56:44.347]  Because if neither of us do good, we all do bad.
[02:56:44.987 --> 02:56:54.259]  And that's the way, really, as we can see it coming back in, is to rebuild this country brick by brick, manufacturing by manufacturer.
[02:56:54.259 --> 02:56:58.625]  It was wonderful to hear about that jeans company, Made in America.
[02:56:58.625 --> 02:57:01.369]  Anybody that's looking to get into business
[02:57:01.889 --> 02:57:03.611]  And to make a mark.
[02:57:03.611 --> 02:57:04.892]  Sell Made in America.
[02:57:04.892 --> 02:57:07.554]  The country's yearning for it and really wants it.
[02:57:07.554 --> 02:57:13.080]  Number two in how to bring it back is we need a productive capacity as well.
[02:57:13.080 --> 02:57:16.323]  And the best way we see it is with an alternative energy.
[02:57:16.883 --> 02:57:20.264]  But not wind, solar, geothermal, or biofuel.
[02:57:20.264 --> 02:57:21.765]  Something much bigger.
[02:57:21.765 --> 02:57:23.606]  And this isn't hyperbole.
[02:57:23.606 --> 02:57:28.728]  Go back to when we went in the 1990s and we were in a very severe recession.
[02:57:28.728 --> 02:57:33.150]  When Clinton got elected under the mantra, it's the economy, stupid.
[02:57:33.150 --> 02:57:34.490]  What got us out?
[02:57:34.490 --> 02:57:36.451]  The internet revolution.
[02:57:36.451 --> 02:57:40.813]  Products were invented, designed, manufactured, marketed, serviced.
[02:57:40.813 --> 02:57:43.474]  We need that with a new energy product.
[02:57:44.314 --> 02:57:53.503]  And by the way, a magazine, I don't have the mentality for it, but for those that do have engineering experience, Infinite Energy.
[02:57:53.503 --> 02:58:02.152]  They're on the cutting edge with cold fusion, zero point energy, charge clusters, permanent magnets, something like that, Alex.
[02:58:02.532 --> 02:58:05.176]  You can't print your way out of this.
[02:58:05.176 --> 02:58:08.040]  You can't, you can't spend out of it.
[02:58:08.040 --> 02:58:13.708]  Just like you or I. If we're deep in debt, we don't borrow more money.
[02:58:13.708 --> 02:58:15.450]  You can only innovate.
[02:58:15.450 --> 02:58:17.333]  You've got to innovate out of it.
[02:58:17.333 --> 02:58:17.894]  Exactly.
[02:58:19.940 --> 02:58:24.063]  When we come back, I want to briefly, well, we're going to take calls, then I'm going to ask you about NASA.
[02:58:24.063 --> 02:58:27.085]  And I'm not for spending $10 billion a year on NASA.
[02:58:27.085 --> 02:58:34.830]  But if you're going to give trillions to the banks over a trillion bucks to the war every year, we can't have $10 billion for NASA?
[02:58:34.830 --> 02:58:38.272]  Again, everything's got to go to the war machine and the banks.
[02:58:38.272 --> 02:58:39.633]  It's killing America.
[02:58:39.633 --> 02:58:43.716]  We'll be back in one minute.
[02:58:43.716 --> 02:58:46.197]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:56.718 --> 02:58:59.479]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[02:58:59.479 --> 02:59:04.802]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[02:59:04.802 --> 02:59:09.284]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.

[02:59:25.316 --> 02:59:27.298]  This film needs to be seen.

[02:59:39.248 --> 02:59:40.669]  Shadow government.

[02:59:42.873 --> 02:59:54.278]  Available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:59:54.278 --> 02:59:56.659]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.659 --> 02:59:59.440]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:05.939 --> 03:00:07.580]  This just went up on the Drudge Report.
[03:00:07.580 --> 03:00:09.882]  What have I been seeing the last three days?
[03:00:09.882 --> 03:00:10.462]  Critics.
[03:00:10.462 --> 03:00:13.324]  Obama administration hyping terrorist attack.
[03:00:13.324 --> 03:00:14.925]  Nuclear terror attack.
[03:00:14.925 --> 03:00:15.226]  U.S.
[03:00:15.226 --> 03:00:18.088]  officials say the claim is not based on new intelligence.
[03:00:18.088 --> 03:00:21.650]  It is made up just like when Bush put it out.
[03:00:21.650 --> 03:00:21.930]  Okay?
[03:00:22.811 --> 03:00:24.592]  Now, there could be some real terror attacks.
[03:00:24.592 --> 03:00:26.953]  That's somebody fighting back like Pakistan.
[03:00:26.953 --> 03:00:30.735]  Or, if we attack Iran, they've said we're gonna attack back.
[03:00:30.735 --> 03:00:32.736]  But, Gerald Solente, I'm no fan of Iran.
[03:00:32.736 --> 03:00:33.776]  I'm America first.
[03:00:33.776 --> 03:00:34.977]  But, it's not America.
[03:00:34.977 --> 03:00:42.460]  It's banks and corporations leading us into these wars that are black holes they steal money out of if they use as political distractions.
[03:00:42.460 --> 03:00:47.582]  I mean, if our country attacks Iran, I mean, what do people expect Iran to do?
[03:00:47.582 --> 03:00:49.163]  I mean, to lay there and take it?
[03:00:49.163 --> 03:00:51.104]  I mean, since when do you... I mean, it'd be like...
[03:00:51.904 --> 03:00:55.747]  Nazi Germany attacking England, and England not fighting back.
[03:00:55.747 --> 03:01:00.431]  Or it'd be like, you know, it's just so asinine, Gerald.
[03:01:01.465 --> 03:01:02.466]  Yes, it is.
[03:01:02.466 --> 03:01:05.509]  And again, let's look at the history of Iran.
[03:01:05.509 --> 03:01:07.030]  First of all, these are the Persians.
[03:01:07.030 --> 03:01:08.691]  They're not going anywhere.
[03:01:08.691 --> 03:01:11.273]  There are 75 million of them.
[03:01:11.273 --> 03:01:13.255]  And, you know, what have they really done?
[03:01:13.255 --> 03:01:18.099]  I don't think that in the last century they haven't colonized anybody.
[03:01:18.099 --> 03:01:20.962]  They didn't attack another, invade another country.
[03:01:20.962 --> 03:01:28.729]  I mean, when you look at the people that are pointing the fingers at Iran, particularly the United States,
[03:01:29.389 --> 03:01:40.281]  France and Israel, you know, their track record of colonization, starting wars, invading countries and occupying them is a lot worse than Iran's is.
[03:01:40.281 --> 03:01:43.444]  So why all of a sudden Iran?
[03:01:43.444 --> 03:01:45.707]  And what if they do get a nuclear weapon?
[03:01:47.196 --> 03:01:48.577]  Well, what are they going to do with it?
[03:01:48.577 --> 03:01:50.618]  They're going to attack somebody with it?
[03:01:50.618 --> 03:01:54.641]  Everyone knows that if they used it, they'd be annihilated.
[03:01:54.641 --> 03:01:57.903]  So this is really to get the people angry.
[03:01:57.903 --> 03:02:00.845]  We need... Communism is gone.
[03:02:00.845 --> 03:02:04.848]  The Germans, you know, during World War II is long over.
[03:02:04.848 --> 03:02:08.511]  The Japanese we don't have anymore to point fingers at.
[03:02:09.091 --> 03:02:12.654]  And now they're looking at the Iranians and North Koreans.
[03:02:12.654 --> 03:02:23.384]  So when we're talking, by the way, of what's going to bring the economy down, if we have a terrorist strike, this economy goes to zero.
[03:02:24.125 --> 03:02:29.051]  We go down an economic dark hole that we'll never be able to pull out of.
[03:02:29.051 --> 03:02:31.654]  Because go back to 9-11.
[03:02:31.654 --> 03:02:33.657]  We were in a recession.
[03:02:33.657 --> 03:02:39.644]  Right after 9-11, Alan, the genius Greens fan, who admits he's wrong,
[03:02:41.226 --> 03:02:48.069]  30% of the time, a C average, he began to lower interest rates to 46-year lows.
[03:02:48.069 --> 03:02:52.211]  We can't do that anymore to juice the economy.
[03:02:52.211 --> 03:03:02.117]  If there's a terror strike, we see an economic terror that will drive this country into the greatest depression a lot faster than we're forecasting.
[03:03:03.240 --> 03:03:06.067]  But the banks will love that because they're waging war against Main Street.
[03:03:06.067 --> 03:03:07.470]  They love things falling apart.
[03:03:07.470 --> 03:03:10.137]  They get to pose as a savior and consolidate society.
[03:03:11.069 --> 03:03:12.349]  Well, the banks are the banks.
[03:03:12.349 --> 03:03:15.991]  You know, they're going to make money any way they can.
[03:03:15.991 --> 03:03:22.453]  We don't have to worry about them going anywhere, because when we get into trouble, you know, we bail them out.
[03:03:22.453 --> 03:03:33.096]  And again, go back to the quotes of Smedley Butler and others who knew the deal and knew what this whole thing is about.
[03:03:33.096 --> 03:03:39.298]  It's about people making a lot of money and doing dirty deals, and the banks are the ones that wash the money.
[03:03:40.507 --> 03:03:45.510]  Absolutely, and that's why Reuters even admits Russia said, okay, kill the poppy fields.
[03:03:45.510 --> 03:03:49.872]  It's up over 12 times what it was nine years ago.
[03:03:49.872 --> 03:03:50.472]  And the U.S.
[03:03:50.472 --> 03:03:53.474]  and NATO said, no, we're going to let them grow and sell the opium.
[03:03:53.474 --> 03:03:58.456]  I mean, it's out in the open, but then cops will raid your house looking for a marijuana cigarette.
[03:03:58.456 --> 03:04:00.297]  We're going directly to your calls when we come back.
[03:04:00.297 --> 03:04:03.038]  I'm going to play a trailer for Invisible Empire that premieres tomorrow.
[03:04:03.038 --> 03:04:04.579]  We're going right to your calls.
[03:04:04.579 --> 03:04:07.841]  I'm going to stop hogging Gerald Solente for myself.
[03:04:08.701 --> 03:04:13.306]  Until about 45 after in the next hour, then I'm going to blitz through a whole bunch of questions.
[03:04:13.306 --> 03:04:19.612]  You can also send your questions to our Twitter account, twitter.com forward slash TheRealAlexJones.
[03:04:19.612 --> 03:04:24.037]  Your questions for Gerald Celente via Twitter as well.
[03:04:24.037 --> 03:04:28.842]  On the other side of this quick break, be sure and visit his website, TrendsResearch.com.
[03:04:28.842 --> 03:04:31.825]  And if you want to buy a subscription, either digital or to the hard copy,
[03:04:32.305 --> 03:04:33.226]  Believe me.
[03:04:33.226 --> 03:04:33.886]  I know a lot.
[03:04:33.886 --> 03:04:34.787]  I research a lot.
[03:04:34.787 --> 03:04:36.148]  I spend four or five hours a day.
[03:04:36.148 --> 03:04:37.328]  That's no exaggeration.
[03:04:37.328 --> 03:04:37.949]  Sometimes more.
[03:04:37.949 --> 03:04:39.590]  I'm pretty addicted to info.
[03:04:39.590 --> 03:04:40.610]  Total info junkie.
[03:04:40.610 --> 03:04:41.431]  Factoid junkie.
[03:04:41.431 --> 03:04:42.531]  History junkie.
[03:04:42.531 --> 03:04:45.193]  I learn something every time I read the Trends Forecaster.
[03:04:45.193 --> 03:04:47.535]  I learn something every time I talk to Gerald Cilente.
[03:04:47.535 --> 03:04:50.757]  We can all learn a lot more from him and all learn together.
[03:04:50.757 --> 03:04:51.457]  So that's coming up.
[03:04:51.457 --> 03:04:55.740]  Be sure and subscribe to the Trends Journal at TrendsResearch.com.
[03:04:55.740 --> 03:04:56.480]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:04:56.480 --> 03:04:59.742]  Our websites are PrisonPlanet.TV and InfoWars.com.
[03:04:59.742 --> 03:05:00.923]  We're premiering two new films.
[03:05:01.872 --> 03:05:04.896]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:04.896 --> 03:05:10.222]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:05:10.222 --> 03:05:12.265]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:05:12.265 --> 03:05:17.291]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:17.291 --> 03:05:18.473]  How much do you want?
[03:05:18.473 --> 03:05:19.194]  When do you want it?
[03:05:19.574 --> 03:05:21.457]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:21.457 --> 03:05:22.538]  When will you need it?
[03:05:22.538 --> 03:05:24.741]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:24.741 --> 03:05:26.083]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:26.083 --> 03:05:27.605]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:27.605 --> 03:05:32.872]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:32.872 --> 03:05:35.997]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:36.437 --> 03:05:40.259]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:40.259 --> 03:05:41.500]  How much will you need?
[03:05:41.500 --> 03:05:42.400]  We don't know.
[03:05:42.400 --> 03:05:43.501]  How much do you want?
[03:05:43.501 --> 03:05:44.421]  All you can get.
[03:05:44.421 --> 03:05:45.522]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.522 --> 03:05:48.583]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:05:48.583 --> 03:05:50.344]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:05:50.344 --> 03:05:51.264]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:01.021 --> 03:06:02.322]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:06:02.322 --> 03:06:07.907]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:06:07.907 --> 03:06:12.932]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:06:12.932 --> 03:06:17.977]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[03:06:18.497 --> 03:06:23.721]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:06:23.721 --> 03:06:30.845]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:06:30.845 --> 03:06:31.966]  And here's the best part.
[03:06:31.966 --> 03:06:38.330]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:06:38.650 --> 03:06:41.833]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[03:06:41.833 --> 03:06:44.055]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[03:06:44.055 --> 03:06:44.996]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:06:44.996 --> 03:06:45.396]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:06:45.396 --> 03:06:48.639]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:06:48.639 --> 03:06:50.381]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:07:02.591 --> 03:07:06.552]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:07:06.552 --> 03:07:15.414]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[03:07:15.414 --> 03:07:20.035]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[03:07:20.035 --> 03:07:30.857]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[03:07:31.477 --> 03:07:40.999]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:07:40.999 --> 03:07:46.421]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[03:07:46.421 --> 03:07:53.922]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:07:53.922 --> 03:07:56.323]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[03:08:12.831 --> 03:08:15.734]  Adolf Hitler, he wanted a world government.
[03:08:15.734 --> 03:08:18.377]  With himself as the master leader.
[03:08:20.159 --> 03:08:29.014]  One small central authority of individuals can then dictate a policy that's going to be distributed down to the rest of the world, everywhere.
[03:08:29.014 --> 03:08:33.481]  The Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the world's superclass.
[03:08:34.423 --> 03:08:41.492]  This documentary chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:08:41.492 --> 03:08:51.404]  We've become accustomed to the idea that every now and then something is going to happen and we just know from the beginning we're not going to get to the bottom of it.
[03:08:53.490 --> 03:09:02.318]  Learn how this global oligarchy controls the populace through drug trafficking, money laundering, staged terror attacks, media propaganda and debt.
[03:09:02.318 --> 03:09:10.245]  Americans are easily motivated by false flag operations and I think it's inevitable that we will see false flag operations in the near future.
[03:09:10.245 --> 03:09:17.311]  Witness their plan for a global tax and a cashless surveillance society in which every man, woman and child is microchipped at birth.
[03:09:17.631 --> 03:09:24.807]  A network Washington set up to run arms to the Congress wound up running cocaine for the most vicious drug cartel in the world.
[03:09:28.883 --> 03:09:34.368]  Bonnie Frank acknowledged having used a male prostitute, whom he then hired as a personal employee.
[03:09:34.368 --> 03:09:37.250]  And he ran a prostitution business out of Frank's home.
[03:09:37.250 --> 03:09:44.677]  If you look at the elite throughout history, many of the people that achieve pinnacles of power are into the occult.
[03:09:44.677 --> 03:09:47.259]  Stories about what happens in these redwoods are hard to come by.
[03:09:54.305 --> 03:09:56.306]  Invisible Empire.
[03:09:56.306 --> 03:09:58.707]  A new world order to find.

[03:10:15.455 --> 03:10:17.656]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:10:17.656 --> 03:10:20.858]  Later in the show, if I have time, why am I playing Odd Couple music?
[03:10:23.706 --> 03:10:24.927]  Newt Gingrich is in trouble.
[03:10:24.927 --> 03:10:27.789]  Republicans are now realizing he was for the banker bailout.
[03:10:27.789 --> 03:10:33.233]  He runs TV ads pushing for global warming taxes with Nancy Pelosi.
[03:10:33.233 --> 03:10:35.134]  These are not odd couples.
[03:10:35.134 --> 03:10:40.558]  The left and right at the top of the power structure work together looting the people and that is exposed
[03:10:41.598 --> 03:10:47.583]  In the upcoming film that premieres in about 25 hours, less than 25 hours, tomorrow when the show ends at 3 p.m.
[03:10:47.583 --> 03:10:48.623]  Central, 4 p.m.
[03:10:48.623 --> 03:10:51.365]  Eastern, we'll premiere it at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[03:11:06.016 --> 03:11:09.897]  Gerald Salente, let's now go ahead and go to some phone calls.
[03:11:09.897 --> 03:11:13.038]  Let's talk to Trip in Florida, who's been holding patiently.
[03:11:13.038 --> 03:11:17.318]  You're on the air with the number one trends forecaster of TrendsResearch.com, Gerald Salente.
[03:11:17.318 --> 03:11:20.099]  Hey Alex and Gerald, how are y'all?
[03:11:20.099 --> 03:11:21.219]  We're all right.
[03:11:21.219 --> 03:11:21.739]  All right.
[03:11:21.739 --> 03:11:26.720]  I was wondering about China's involvement in all this.
[03:11:26.720 --> 03:11:28.981]  I saw mainstream media yesterday that
[03:11:30.453 --> 03:11:34.155]  China was gonna back us up in this whole Iran business.
[03:11:34.155 --> 03:11:36.817]  So, um, that kind of makes me nervous.
[03:11:36.817 --> 03:11:40.499]  Yeah, how does China play into the big picture economically, militarily, everything?
[03:11:41.547 --> 03:11:47.849]  Well, China is only going to go so far with Iran because they're doing a lot of business with them.
[03:11:47.849 --> 03:11:49.829]  And China's holding all the cards.
[03:11:49.829 --> 03:11:51.990]  They're holding all our debt.
[03:11:51.990 --> 03:11:56.371]  So we really have to play the China game, not the other way around.
[03:11:56.371 --> 03:11:58.251]  And that's what we're really looking at.
[03:11:58.251 --> 03:12:10.274]  And all this noise, by the way, about letting the yuan float so that American exports can be more competitive, meaning that it is going to cost more to buy Chinese products.
[03:12:10.774 --> 03:12:13.697]  That's only for public consumption.
[03:12:13.697 --> 03:12:18.821]  China's producing stuff at slave labor wages.
[03:12:18.821 --> 03:12:24.326]  If their currency goes up a little bit, it's not like everybody's going to be buying U.S.
[03:12:24.326 --> 03:12:25.326]  products.
[03:12:25.326 --> 03:12:28.289]  So China's really the ace in the hole over here.
[03:12:28.289 --> 03:12:35.335]  Because the other problem with China is last year, for example, they had 70,000, 70,000 major disturbances and riots.
[03:12:39.258 --> 03:12:46.300]  If the Chinese economy doesn't keep perking along, they have 1.2 billion problems on their hands.
[03:12:46.300 --> 03:12:48.481]  And let's not forget this.
[03:12:48.481 --> 03:13:05.127]  One of the only reasons why this economy didn't crash worse than it has, and quicker than it has, is because China has been throwing trillions of dollars into pumping up their economy, and by extension, the world economy.
[03:13:05.127 --> 03:13:08.508]  So now when China, as they're doing now, starts to wind back,
[03:13:09.069 --> 03:13:10.818]  The economy starts to slow up.
[03:13:12.216 --> 03:13:13.536]  Because we don't have a real economy.
[03:13:13.536 --> 03:13:21.279]  We have a parasite banking economy, a global banking dictatorship, and now we have no more denial about world government.
[03:13:21.279 --> 03:13:32.123]  We have Gordon Brown, Obama, saying we're going to have a planetary regime with carbon taxes paid to private banks under a global constitution where the banks will be the government.
[03:13:32.123 --> 03:13:35.804]  I mean, this is moving faster than I even thought it would.
[03:13:35.804 --> 03:13:39.125]  I don't see how they're going to get away with this open tyranny, Gerald.
[03:13:39.753 --> 03:13:42.035]  Well, they're getting away with it now.
[03:13:42.035 --> 03:13:44.838]  And again, we've said this over and over again.
[03:13:44.838 --> 03:13:49.643]  The merger of state and corporate powers is fascism.
[03:13:49.643 --> 03:13:53.787]  And what happens when you live under a fascist dictator?
[03:13:53.787 --> 03:13:56.009]  You don't get out of line.
[03:13:56.009 --> 03:13:57.510]  Anything else?
[03:13:57.510 --> 03:13:58.571]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:13:58.571 --> 03:14:01.174]  No, and that's what they're doing now.
[03:14:01.174 --> 03:14:02.315]  Anything else, Tripp?
[03:14:02.315 --> 03:14:02.815]  Police State 4.
[03:14:04.483 --> 03:14:06.464]  Absolutely.
[03:14:06.464 --> 03:14:06.804]  Thank you.
[03:14:06.804 --> 03:14:08.004]  I appreciate the call, Trev.
[03:14:08.004 --> 03:14:11.945]  Justin in West Virginia, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:14:11.945 --> 03:14:13.646]  Yeah, hey guys, how you doing?
[03:14:13.646 --> 03:14:14.486]  Alright, go ahead, sir.
[03:14:14.486 --> 03:14:23.128]  I was just wanting to read a couple sentences from a story that someone wrote about the health bill, and then I was going to ask the question to Gerald.
[03:14:23.128 --> 03:14:29.450]  Yeah, that's one of my later questions is the health care bill, his analysis of it, but go ahead and read your point.
[03:14:31.130 --> 03:14:37.995]  Uh, he put in there, insurance companies can no longer drop clients who become sick, giving them lifetime coverage.
[03:14:37.995 --> 03:14:43.159]  Pre-existing medical conditions, uh, people will still be available.
[03:14:43.159 --> 03:14:48.844]  And at the end, he said, life expectancy will be sure to go up and, uh, it'll help, um,
[03:14:50.307 --> 03:14:54.049]  Make the economy better by having less people file for bankruptcy.
[03:14:54.049 --> 03:15:02.794]  And my question was, what does Gerald think about how the health bill is going to fit in with the crash that he predicts is coming up?
[03:15:02.794 --> 03:15:05.476]  Gerald, give us your breakdown of the health care bill.
[03:15:05.976 --> 03:15:08.959]  Well, the health care bill is not going to accelerate the crash.
[03:15:08.959 --> 03:15:11.261]  That's a minor player in it, although it's a big one.
[03:15:11.261 --> 03:15:15.185]  That's a health care bill, again, another example of fascism.
[03:15:15.185 --> 03:15:20.750]  We're being forced to buy insurance from criminal insurance companies?
[03:15:20.750 --> 03:15:22.972]  How could you make this stuff up?
[03:15:22.972 --> 03:15:24.333]  And what is it going to do?
[03:15:24.333 --> 03:15:26.696]  Perpetuate a failing system.
[03:15:26.696 --> 03:15:28.918]  Look at the condition of the American people.
[03:15:29.398 --> 03:15:30.479]  What are we doing?
[03:15:30.479 --> 03:15:37.682]  We're gonna be dumping more money into a system whereby the people are in very bad shape themselves, not taking care of themselves.
[03:15:37.682 --> 03:15:39.243]  They're addicted to drugs!
[03:15:39.243 --> 03:15:41.003]  Turn on the television!
[03:15:41.003 --> 03:15:41.624]  I love it!
[03:15:41.624 --> 03:15:42.484]  What is this?
[03:15:42.484 --> 03:15:44.265]  Fibromyalgia, one of them?
[03:15:44.625 --> 03:15:49.386]  I'm watching, you know, I guess that replaced Epstein-Barr disease.
[03:15:49.386 --> 03:15:57.668]  They keep making up these things so people become hypochondriacs, and then they have the disclaimer, you can't make this stuff up!
[03:15:57.668 --> 03:16:00.268]  A side effect is suicide!
[03:16:00.268 --> 03:16:08.830]  So all this is, is a system to keep the people in control, to make them think that they're doing something for them,
[03:16:09.210 --> 03:16:09.510]  Absolutely.
[03:16:09.510 --> 03:16:15.757]  Let me give you my take on it, which mirrors what Gerald is saying, and good points, Justin.
[03:16:15.757 --> 03:16:17.119]  There's a war
[03:16:27.930 --> 03:16:28.411]  going on
[03:16:45.713 --> 03:16:46.433]  I'm not a Republican.
[03:16:46.433 --> 03:16:47.174]  I'm not a Democrat.
[03:16:47.174 --> 03:16:48.314]  I'm a freedom lover.
[03:16:48.314 --> 03:16:49.735]  I'm a truth teller.
[03:16:49.735 --> 03:16:52.616]  I have read the five different versions of the bill, the past bill.
[03:16:52.616 --> 03:16:54.316]  I've scanned over the key sections.
[03:16:54.316 --> 03:16:55.997]  I've had congressmen on.
[03:16:55.997 --> 03:16:56.617]  I've read it.
[03:16:56.617 --> 03:16:58.178]  And then after the fact, they admitted it.
[03:16:58.178 --> 03:16:59.758]  No one's getting free health care.
[03:16:59.758 --> 03:17:02.679]  It doesn't cover pre-existing conditions.
[03:17:02.679 --> 03:17:04.360]  In fact, pull up the AP.
[03:17:04.360 --> 03:17:07.261]  It says, what was the headline of the exact headline?
[03:17:07.261 --> 03:17:11.443]  It was oversight in bill
[03:17:12.617 --> 03:17:13.738]  Like it was a mistake.
[03:17:13.738 --> 03:17:15.699]  Oh, didn't give you coverage.
[03:17:15.699 --> 03:17:17.961]  It makes 30 plus million people buy coverage.
[03:17:17.961 --> 03:17:20.142]  It lets the insurance companies lower the standard.
[03:17:20.142 --> 03:17:22.944]  It allows them to raise premiums.
[03:17:22.944 --> 03:17:24.705]  They're saying over 32% right now.
[03:17:24.705 --> 03:17:27.807]  39% on average in California.
[03:17:27.807 --> 03:17:28.788]  That's AP today.
[03:17:28.788 --> 03:17:29.868]  I covered it in the first hour.
[03:17:29.868 --> 03:17:30.048]  39%.
[03:17:30.048 --> 03:17:33.311]  It makes you get it.
[03:17:33.311 --> 03:17:35.392]  You've seen the VA run healthcare.
[03:17:35.632 --> 03:17:38.053]  But this isn't government healthcare, as Ron Paul said.
[03:17:38.053 --> 03:17:39.934]  It's corporate healthcare.
[03:17:39.934 --> 03:17:44.857]  It's the government, though, dictating what doctors can do and what they can't do.
[03:17:44.857 --> 03:17:46.398]  Gerald Solente.
[03:17:46.398 --> 03:17:47.018]  Oh, you hit it.
[03:17:47.018 --> 03:17:48.859]  You covered all the points.
[03:17:48.859 --> 03:17:50.000]  Let's take another call here.
[03:17:52.415 --> 03:17:54.097]  There's that other one too.
[03:17:54.097 --> 03:17:54.857]  What is that?
[03:17:54.857 --> 03:17:58.261]  That army of doctors that they're now putting together?
[03:17:58.261 --> 03:18:10.033]  Another military wing that's allowed to really become a militia, a government militia of doctors that they're also having that bill.
[03:18:10.433 --> 03:18:18.758]  And they say federally they've got to report parents to CPS and ask the kids questions, but the point I forgot to make is, it's a war of truth and lies.
[03:18:18.758 --> 03:18:23.701]  I was watching Hardball two nights ago, and everything coming out of Matthew's mouth was a lie.
[03:18:23.701 --> 03:18:25.062]  That's why the guy's got 400,000 viewers.
[03:18:26.283 --> 03:18:31.007]  Folks, this radio show, conservatively, has double that every day.
[03:18:31.007 --> 03:18:32.368]  This guy's a joke.
[03:18:32.368 --> 03:18:39.675]  No one is watching Anderson Cooper, and no one is watching these people on CNN, MSNBC.
[03:18:39.675 --> 03:18:44.138]  CNN's lost more than half its ratings in the last year because people are getting wise to him.
[03:18:44.138 --> 03:18:46.981]  But, Gerald, I still can't believe him saying
[03:18:47.381 --> 03:18:52.844]  There's no rationing, there's no death panels when it does have the bioethics panels.
[03:18:52.844 --> 03:18:56.085]  Tom Daschle said we will cut care to the old people.
[03:18:56.085 --> 03:18:59.207]  I mean, don't they know the public is going to find out they're lying?
[03:18:59.207 --> 03:19:00.708]  I mean, it's just such lying!
[03:19:01.786 --> 03:19:02.647]  They're hacks.
[03:19:02.647 --> 03:19:03.507]  I mean, let's face it.
[03:19:03.507 --> 03:19:05.028]  Look at what they represent.
[03:19:05.028 --> 03:19:06.609]  Look where they come from.
[03:19:06.609 --> 03:19:08.751]  By their deeds, you shall know them.
[03:19:08.751 --> 03:19:11.172]  You go through the whole list of these guys.
[03:19:11.172 --> 03:19:12.533]  These TV tough guys.
[03:19:12.533 --> 03:19:13.974]  These big mouths.
[03:19:13.974 --> 03:19:16.116]  They're just playing to the crowd.
[03:19:16.116 --> 03:19:18.077]  And he's, you know, he's one of the crowd.
[03:19:18.077 --> 03:19:24.762]  We're going to come back and take some more calls, but when we come back, I first want to ask Gerald Cilente, because I'm interested in his take.
[03:19:25.871 --> 03:19:29.496]  Time Magazine, Newsweek, I'll ask the question now, we'll get the answer when we come back.
[03:19:29.496 --> 03:19:41.270]  Time Magazine, London Guardian, Newsweek, Southern Poverty Law Center, every publication run by George Soros are lying and saying I'm calling for violence and I'm dangerous.
[03:19:42.251 --> 03:19:47.414]  Why are they singling me out more really than anybody else now on a daily basis?
[03:19:47.414 --> 03:19:50.636]  What does Gerald think that is really all about?
[03:19:50.636 --> 03:19:56.440]  Because I really want to get his take on it, and I want to ask him if he's had any threats or demonization out there as well.
[03:19:56.440 --> 03:20:00.422]  Then we're going right back to your phone calls, Ron, Scott, Pamela, and others.
[03:20:00.422 --> 03:20:00.783]  We'll be back.
[03:20:01.789 --> 03:20:04.771]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[03:20:04.771 --> 03:20:08.914]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[03:20:08.914 --> 03:20:11.175]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[03:20:11.175 --> 03:20:16.338]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[03:20:16.338 --> 03:20:18.160]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[03:20:18.160 --> 03:20:19.701]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[03:20:19.701 --> 03:20:21.201]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[03:20:21.201 --> 03:20:24.564]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[03:20:24.564 --> 03:20:29.587]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[03:20:30.007 --> 03:20:30.207]  I think?
[03:20:44.804 --> 03:20:47.927]  Investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.

[03:22:10.333 --> 03:22:12.974]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:22:12.974 --> 03:22:18.695]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[03:22:18.695 --> 03:22:24.897]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[03:22:25.357 --> 03:22:31.340]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.

[03:22:49.307 --> 03:22:51.268]  The police state isn't coming.

[03:24:16.345 --> 03:24:20.989]  Continuing with your phone calls with Gerald Cilente in this extended two-hour interview.
[03:24:20.989 --> 03:24:23.331]  We've got about 35 minutes left with him today.
[03:24:23.331 --> 03:24:25.372]  Top Trends Forecaster.
[03:24:25.372 --> 03:24:31.978]  Gerald, again, I'm selfishly asking you the question, but also it lets us understand politically what they're concerned about.
[03:24:31.978 --> 03:24:33.359]  I'm not in the left-right paradigm.
[03:24:33.359 --> 03:24:35.201]  I'm a political atheist like yourself.
[03:24:35.201 --> 03:24:36.341]  I'm a constitutionalist.
[03:24:37.122 --> 03:24:40.706]  They're trying to demonize the Tea Party, anybody that criticizes the banks.
[03:24:40.706 --> 03:24:47.152]  Three years ago, you predicted there'd be these grassroots protests and rebellions against taxation, against the banks.
[03:24:47.152 --> 03:24:48.354]  That's now unfolding.
[03:24:48.354 --> 03:24:51.697]  Why do you think they're singling me out particularly?
[03:24:51.697 --> 03:24:54.640]  I mean, if a cop gets shot, they say it's my fault with no evidence.
[03:24:54.640 --> 03:24:57.984]  Why do you think we're a year into this program of demonization?
[03:24:58.786 --> 03:25:07.631]  Because you're making a difference and you're waking people up and you're speaking to what a lot of people feel and they don't want that to happen.
[03:25:07.631 --> 03:25:11.353]  So it's logical that they would do that.
[03:25:11.353 --> 03:25:15.655]  They want to stop the force that has the most power.
[03:25:15.655 --> 03:25:19.257]  And it's like cutting off the head of a snake.
[03:25:19.257 --> 03:25:25.500]  They feel as though if they could stop you, they could stop the movement in a lot of ways because you're at the forefront of it.
[03:25:26.221 --> 03:25:33.883]  And they're going to continue to do it and demonize everybody that they can, that exposes the fraud going on.
[03:25:33.883 --> 03:25:39.044]  I remember talking about what was going on, about how this, this, this D.C.
[03:25:39.044 --> 03:25:42.525]  Ice, we called it, Wall Street hijacks Washington.
[03:25:42.525 --> 03:25:47.667]  How when we first said that, it was considered outrageous that we would think that.
[03:25:47.667 --> 03:25:52.748]  So anytime that you begin to expose the fraud, the criminality, and the corruption,
[03:25:53.388 --> 03:25:58.121]  They want to shut you down because you cost them a lot of money and a lot of problems.
[03:25:59.301 --> 03:26:04.524]  But why would all these major TV networks and publications say I'm calling for violence?
[03:26:04.524 --> 03:26:13.589]  And Fox admitted in a news article too, they wrote, they called Homeland Security on us, I don't know if you knew this, two weeks ago, off comments on a message board implying that they were ours.
[03:26:13.589 --> 03:26:19.353]  Then we found far worse comments on Fox Nation's own website, their own pundits even saying more.
[03:26:19.353 --> 03:26:22.735]  Do you think they're getting ready to set me up, or is this just to demonize me?
[03:26:22.735 --> 03:26:26.577]  I mean, because it looks like they're trying to sic the cops and the IRS on me.
[03:26:27.332 --> 03:26:37.883]  Well, they're probably well aware of that already, and they're just going to look for any kind of breach that they could give an excuse to come in with, just like they do with everyone else.
[03:26:37.883 --> 03:26:47.653]  So, it's again, you know, you said it before, the only thing you have in this life is your word and your dignity, and that's all you leave behind is your word.
[03:26:48.394 --> 03:26:50.596]  So, of course, there's always the threat.
[03:26:50.596 --> 03:26:59.943]  I mean, I have to tell you, back in 2002, in the Trends Journal, in my column, I wrote, it's getting dangerous.
[03:26:59.943 --> 03:27:13.774]  And I said that I'm going to be careful what I say, because when they come out from the government saying, and you remember during the Bush years, you're either with us or against us, and you have to be careful what you say.
[03:27:13.774 --> 03:27:16.016]  And we're entering into a period like that.
[03:27:16.676 --> 03:27:20.838]  And I make this really clear, I'm not willing to die for my country.
[03:27:20.838 --> 03:27:22.898]  Because what is my country?
[03:27:22.898 --> 03:27:27.140]  My country certainly isn't the Democrats or the Republicans.
[03:27:27.140 --> 03:27:37.063]  So when do you say, hey listen, knock yourself out, do what you want to do, but I'm not going to take shots for anybody.
[03:27:37.063 --> 03:27:38.264]  I make that really clear.
[03:27:38.704 --> 03:27:43.388]  And I make it very clear that we're calling for an intellectual revolution.
[03:27:43.388 --> 03:27:50.874]  So what I would suggest you continue to do, every chance you can, is to say, we want a peaceful change.
[03:27:50.874 --> 03:27:53.756]  And you see, here's what's going on, Alex.
[03:27:55.157 --> 03:27:59.801]  The more they lose control, the harder they're going to clamp down.
[03:27:59.801 --> 03:28:02.023]  And this is what the people need to know.
[03:28:02.023 --> 03:28:14.392]  And that's why we're saying the more that they start losing, the more control that slips away, they're going to create a violent situation so they can crack down on it.
[03:28:14.392 --> 03:28:21.158]  And do you agree that they're clearly trying to provocateur, well they've been caught, violence and that they want to, they wanted to get violent?
[03:28:22.102 --> 03:28:26.104]  I don't know if they want to, but I know that nothing I... Read my lips.
[03:28:26.104 --> 03:28:27.124]  No new taxes.
[03:28:27.124 --> 03:28:29.746]  I didn't have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky.
[03:28:29.746 --> 03:28:31.246]  I smoked, but I didn't inhale.
[03:28:31.246 --> 03:28:34.088]  Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction.
[03:28:34.088 --> 03:28:35.268]  I'm no crook.
[03:28:35.268 --> 03:28:38.370]  How can anybody believe anything they say?
[03:28:38.370 --> 03:28:41.391]  Remember the Maine, the Gulf of Tonkin?
[03:28:41.391 --> 03:28:43.653]  One lie built after another.
[03:28:43.653 --> 03:28:46.894]  These are psychopaths and sociopaths.
[03:28:46.894 --> 03:28:50.616]  Look at this guy, this, this, uh, what, Edwards.
[03:28:50.816 --> 03:28:58.001]  John Edwards, whiter than white, you know, talking about morality, and he gets caught with a chick.
[03:28:58.001 --> 03:29:01.603]  I mean, Spitzer, I talked about it one after another.
[03:29:01.603 --> 03:29:05.586]  Look up the definition of a sociopath.
[03:29:05.586 --> 03:29:09.729]  This is who they are, and this is the way they behave.
[03:29:09.729 --> 03:29:13.251]  They will do anything to maintain their control.
[03:29:13.251 --> 03:29:18.615]  They act with all of the respectability and dignity in front of the folks
[03:29:21.396 --> 03:29:25.277]  And behind the scenes, they're doing their dirty little stuff.
[03:29:25.277 --> 03:29:28.098]  And again, they're not even man enough to admit it.
[03:29:28.098 --> 03:29:37.742]  Whoever made up this stuff, as soon as you get caught having sex, you promise you're gonna go to sex addiction therapy.
[03:29:37.742 --> 03:29:41.783]  When did they make this sex addiction therapy thing up?
[03:29:42.503 --> 03:29:43.844]  Yeah, well, and exactly.
[03:29:43.844 --> 03:29:48.749]  The media makes it a big deal about sex with women as they steal trillions of dollars.
[03:29:48.749 --> 03:29:50.110]  I mean, what's the real crime here?
[03:29:50.110 --> 03:29:51.992]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[03:29:51.992 --> 03:29:53.394]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.394 --> 03:29:55.916]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.916 --> 03:29:58.619]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:03.002 --> 03:30:05.484]  And you're subject to public police action.
[03:30:05.484 --> 03:30:06.745]  Tyranny is here.
[03:30:06.745 --> 03:30:10.428]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:30:10.428 --> 03:30:12.930]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:30:12.930 --> 03:30:18.794]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:30:18.794 --> 03:30:24.999]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:30:25.439 --> 03:30:31.422]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:30:31.422 --> 03:30:35.604]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[03:30:35.604 --> 03:30:39.887]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:30:39.887 --> 03:30:45.850]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:30:45.850 --> 03:30:49.392]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:30:49.392 --> 03:30:51.373]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:30:51.373 --> 03:30:51.793]  It's here.
[03:30:52.473 --> 03:31:01.459]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:31:01.459 --> 03:31:03.821]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:31:03.821 --> 03:31:06.042]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:31:06.042 --> 03:31:09.365]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:31:09.365 --> 03:31:14.468]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:31:14.468 --> 03:31:18.671]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:31:18.971 --> 03:31:21.313]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:31:21.313 --> 03:31:24.195]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:31:24.195 --> 03:31:27.117]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:31:27.117 --> 03:31:34.723]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:31:35.043 --> 03:31:40.428]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:31:40.428 --> 03:31:42.750]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:31:42.750 --> 03:31:46.993]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:31:46.993 --> 03:31:48.074]  And I got news for you.
[03:31:48.074 --> 03:31:49.395]  You're everyone else.
[03:31:49.395 --> 03:31:50.896]  Invisible Empire.

[03:32:06.997 --> 03:32:12.779]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day.
[03:32:12.779 --> 03:32:17.121]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, goodbye effectiveness?
[03:32:17.121 --> 03:32:18.822]  No more protection until you use it again.

[03:32:55.627 --> 03:32:57.048]  No one knows what it's like to be the best
[03:33:10.217 --> 03:33:22.719]  Continuing with your phone calls for Gerald Cilente, and I've got some other questions I want to ask him and some Twitter questions as well.
[03:33:22.719 --> 03:33:25.300]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ron in Texas.
[03:33:25.300 --> 03:33:26.120]  Ron, you're on the air.
[03:33:26.120 --> 03:33:27.160]  Go ahead.
[03:33:27.160 --> 03:33:28.140]  It's always a pleasure.
[03:33:28.140 --> 03:33:30.861]  Mr. Cilente, it is a complete honor.
[03:33:30.861 --> 03:33:32.801]  I've got two questions, actually.
[03:33:32.801 --> 03:33:38.782]  One, there was a 2005 PNAP report by Gary Schmidt that started off saying
[03:33:39.517 --> 03:33:43.598]  That Iran's nuclear capability was about 10 years behind.
[03:33:43.598 --> 03:33:52.621]  So my first question is, what do you see in your professional opinion as the reality of their capability?
[03:33:52.621 --> 03:34:00.604]  The other one is, some time ago we had a warhead that was known as the Whiskey 54, which was
[03:34:02.865 --> 03:34:10.469]  Nicknamed a Davy Crockett and a Special Atomics Demolition Munition that was man-portable.
[03:34:10.469 --> 03:34:15.211]  The reason why I'm stating this is this yielded somewhere between 1 and 10 kilotons.
[03:34:15.211 --> 03:34:26.816]  So would you say that they would go more, if they played this card, go more out of a kiloton yield or seeing as how the megatons would be too destructive and kind of
[03:34:31.023 --> 03:34:40.389]  We believe that Iran is eventually going to have nuclear weapons.
[03:34:40.389 --> 03:34:43.030]  I guess you could bring it down to the right to bear arms.
[03:34:43.030 --> 03:34:45.151]  They're in a very hostile region.
[03:34:45.151 --> 03:34:47.393]  They have hostile neighbors.
[03:34:47.393 --> 03:34:50.695]  And it's probably going to be for defensive purposes.
[03:34:51.260 --> 03:35:01.122]  Look, India has them, Pakistan has them, both of them have not signed a nuclear proliferation treaty, as has Israel that hasn't signed it either.
[03:35:01.122 --> 03:35:04.182]  So, we believe at some point they're going to get it.
[03:35:04.182 --> 03:35:06.703]  To use it as a whole nother thing.
[03:35:06.703 --> 03:35:11.604]  It's like being armed and not going to war for defensive purposes.
[03:35:11.604 --> 03:35:18.725]  And we would say, logically, we believe that Iran is going to move toward nuclear, and there's no stopping them.
[03:35:19.245 --> 03:35:22.508]  And again, under what province do you do that?
[03:35:22.508 --> 03:35:25.271]  When does the hypocrisy stop?
[03:35:25.271 --> 03:35:37.643]  Why can the UK, why can France, why can India, why can China, why can Israel, and why can the United States have nuclear weapons, and Russia, and not Iran?
[03:35:37.643 --> 03:35:38.844]  Well look at North Korea!
[03:35:38.844 --> 03:35:40.666]  As soon as you get a nuclear, you're left alone!
[03:35:41.306 --> 03:35:43.868]  Yeah, I mean, you know, are they going to use them?
[03:35:43.868 --> 03:35:46.851]  If they use them, they're going to suffer the consequences.
[03:35:46.851 --> 03:35:49.313]  Are they going to use them against Russia and China?
[03:35:49.313 --> 03:35:51.395]  They'll get wiped out like a gnat!
[03:35:51.395 --> 03:35:58.581]  Even if they use them against Israel, the firepower coming back would be multiples way beyond.
[03:35:58.581 --> 03:36:02.544]  So, and then again, who in their right mind would use a nuclear weapon?
[03:36:02.544 --> 03:36:04.486]  Well, then they say, oh, they're crazy Muslims, but...
[03:36:05.246 --> 03:36:08.348]  I mean, looking at that, Iran's nuclear program is public.
[03:36:08.348 --> 03:36:10.990]  The centrifuges won't make the uranium they need.
[03:36:10.990 --> 03:36:15.013]  They even offered to have France make it, so everybody knew that it wasn't able to do that.
[03:36:15.013 --> 03:36:18.595]  I mean, Venezuela wants nuclear reactors now.
[03:36:18.595 --> 03:36:20.316]  They are having power outages.
[03:36:20.316 --> 03:36:22.678]  I mean, South Africa's got nukes.
[03:36:22.678 --> 03:36:25.299]  Our government has overthrown Iran twice.
[03:36:25.299 --> 03:36:27.401]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[03:36:28.163 --> 03:36:35.769]  I know, and that's what we're saying, but what they're doing is they're using Iran as the symbol for people to hate.
[03:36:35.769 --> 03:36:40.873]  And once you get the people to hate, then they can prosecute their wars.
[03:36:40.873 --> 03:36:43.375]  And they won't hate the bankers now, that is the real problem.
[03:36:43.975 --> 03:36:48.177]  Of course, the bankers will be forgotten, because that's what we were saying in the beginning.
[03:36:48.177 --> 03:36:52.859]  This is the same scenario, different names, different places.
[03:36:52.859 --> 03:36:59.562]  It's 1929, it's the Great Depression, and it's World War II.
[03:36:59.562 --> 03:37:05.205]  Well, it's the Panic of 08, we're gonna go into the Great Depression, we're already in it.
[03:37:05.205 --> 03:37:07.646]  Look how many people have it, don't have jobs.
[03:37:07.646 --> 03:37:08.546]  You know the numbers.
[03:37:08.546 --> 03:37:10.407]  What's the effective unemployment rate?
[03:37:10.407 --> 03:37:10.667]  Around 20%?
[03:37:12.188 --> 03:37:19.550]  You know, so, and now they're going to, the way they're going to get us out of it when all their other schemes fail, is they're going to take us to war!
[03:37:19.550 --> 03:37:22.531]  They're taking us to war in Pakistan!
[03:37:22.531 --> 03:37:24.651]  Look what's going on over there!
[03:37:24.651 --> 03:37:36.555]  We're in Pakistan, we're in Afghanistan, we're in Iraq, and we're going to go, we're fearful of fighting a war with Iran.
[03:37:36.555 --> 03:37:41.616]  Absolutely, let's go ahead and talk to Scott in Texas, you're on the air, then Pamela, Jim, Paul and others.
[03:37:42.972 --> 03:37:43.493]  Hi, Gerald.
[03:37:43.493 --> 03:37:44.414]  Hi, Alex.
[03:37:44.414 --> 03:37:45.355]  Hi.
[03:37:45.355 --> 03:37:49.160]  Gerald, I've got two questions for you today.
[03:37:49.160 --> 03:37:58.512]  One to do with the coming war that y'all are predicting, and the other one is trying to forecast exactly when the collapse will happen.
[03:37:59.625 --> 03:38:06.788]  Yeah, again, the collapsing timings, it's very difficult for the timing because they come up with schemes undreamed of.
[03:38:06.788 --> 03:38:09.349]  But you're saying as early as September of this year?
[03:38:09.349 --> 03:38:16.813]  We believe that we could have it by September because, again, who would have thought we would have been bailing out banks and buying up companies?
[03:38:16.813 --> 03:38:21.575]  So it should have gone down and then they do all these things behind the scenes that we don't know about.
[03:38:21.575 --> 03:38:26.657]  But we believe by, and then the other issue, I'm sorry, the other question was?
[03:38:26.657 --> 03:38:27.737]  War.
[03:38:27.737 --> 03:38:28.758]  When do you see that happening?
[03:38:29.804 --> 03:38:38.232]  Again, you know, the timing's very difficult, but we believe it's going to be sooner rather than later, and it's going to be steps into the Great War.
[03:38:38.232 --> 03:38:48.381]  It's not going to be one day, but it can be one day if there is a 9-11 magnitude terror strike, which we believe is going to happen.
[03:38:48.381 --> 03:38:51.944]  So you have all these different factors going on at one time.
[03:38:51.944 --> 03:38:54.226]  Which one's going to be the tripping point?
[03:38:54.226 --> 03:38:56.148]  It's very difficult to say at this point.
[03:39:00.319 --> 03:39:02.501]  Scott, does that answer your question?
[03:39:02.501 --> 03:39:07.186]  I just wanted to ask one quick thing about the war part.
[03:39:07.186 --> 03:39:15.674]  Hugh Court has a website where he calls that Bin Laden has plans for an American Hiroshima.
[03:39:15.674 --> 03:39:24.743]  I wonder if Gerald is familiar with what's available through Dr. Court and if he would have any, you know, does he put much credibility into that?
[03:39:25.519 --> 03:39:35.187]  I've been hearing from Bin Laden now for how many years, you know, and I don't think he has the wherewithal, even if he's even there, if there isn't a Bin Laden anymore.
[03:39:35.187 --> 03:39:36.448]  Scott, I appreciate your call.
[03:39:36.448 --> 03:39:37.489]  Let me comment on that.
[03:39:37.489 --> 03:39:40.712]  Look, we know Al Qaeda was created by the CIA.
[03:39:40.712 --> 03:39:42.594]  We know Bin Laden was CIA.
[03:39:42.594 --> 03:39:44.756]  We know that every week or two there's a new article
[03:39:45.456 --> 03:39:51.199]  Quoting him from some message board or audio, and at the bottom it says, we don't know this is him or not.
[03:39:51.199 --> 03:39:53.360]  This is a boogeyman, a Goldstein.
[03:39:53.360 --> 03:39:54.800]  Somebody to scare the population.
[03:39:54.800 --> 03:39:55.961]  Here's the Washington Times.
[03:39:55.961 --> 03:39:56.781]  Critics.
[03:39:56.781 --> 03:39:59.923]  Obama administration hyping terrorist nuclear risk.
[03:40:00.743 --> 03:40:07.288]  The Obama administration is warning that the danger of a terror attack within the United States with a nuclear weapon is increasing.
[03:40:07.288 --> 03:40:07.848]  But U.S.
[03:40:07.848 --> 03:40:14.493]  officials say the claim is not based on new intelligence and questioned whether the threat is being overstated.
[03:40:14.493 --> 03:40:28.124]  And President Obama went on in the 47-nation nuclear summit, they were having to conclude that the risk of nuclear confrontation has gone down between nations, but the risk of nuclear attack from terrorists has gone up.
[03:40:28.704 --> 03:40:42.165]  I mean this and then it's got all these top analysts saying this is political hype and fear-mongering and Obama's trying to blame it on Iran when Iran is Shiite, the archenemy of the Saudi Arabian Al-Qaeda Wahhabis.
[03:40:42.165 --> 03:40:43.146]  Comments on that Gerald?
[03:40:44.365 --> 03:40:45.546]  You've covered it.
[03:40:45.546 --> 03:40:46.627]  It is hype.
[03:40:46.627 --> 03:40:48.488]  And it could happen, by the way.
[03:40:48.488 --> 03:41:02.357]  You know, when I wrote Trends 2000 back in 1996, we front-loaded it with the breakup of the former Soviet Union and all of the suitcase-sized nukes and other nuclear materials that were being sold on the black market.
[03:41:02.777 --> 03:41:11.960]  So again, with the foreign policy going in the direction it's going in, of course there's going to be major reprisals against the United States.
[03:41:11.960 --> 03:41:14.921]  Anybody that thinks differently is out of their mind.
[03:41:14.921 --> 03:41:21.623]  You can't invade other countries, occupy them, kill hundreds of thousands of people, and not want people to get even with you.
[03:41:22.003 --> 03:41:32.874]  How they do it, whether it's nuclear, a biological attack, whether it's a, you know, whatever it might be, in a stadium, in a shopping mall, it's going to happen.
[03:41:32.874 --> 03:41:36.938]  But Gerald, what I'm saying is in this inverted logic,
[03:41:38.703 --> 03:41:40.764]  Terrorism will help the New World Order.
[03:41:40.764 --> 03:41:47.547]  It will help the fascists, the corporatists, because the public doesn't understand we're attacking other people.
[03:41:47.547 --> 03:41:51.029]  You know, if a cop breaks his baton on your head, he charges you.
[03:41:51.029 --> 03:41:53.250]  This literally happens with assaulting him now.
[03:41:53.250 --> 03:41:59.633]  There's a big federal case, of course, with Maryland University over this right now.
[03:41:59.633 --> 03:42:06.776]  And so, it really helps the establishment to stage terror attacks as a pretext to launch these new wars.
[03:42:07.643 --> 03:42:13.107]  Alex, you don't need any clearer proof than Afghanistan and Iraq.
[03:42:13.107 --> 03:42:19.531]  Iraq is a war being fought under false pretenses.
[03:42:19.531 --> 03:42:22.193]  There was no weapons of mass destruction.
[03:42:22.193 --> 03:42:24.895]  There was no ties to al-Qaeda.
[03:42:24.895 --> 03:42:31.059]  And go back and look at what the reasoning was to attack Afghanistan.
[03:42:31.059 --> 03:42:37.123]  It was to get Osama bin Laden and close down the terrorist camps.
[03:42:37.603 --> 03:42:51.292]  So they're going to use anything they can, fake or real, to keep the military machine going and to keep the people under their thumb in the height of fear.
[03:42:51.292 --> 03:43:04.360]  And as you mentioned, they're using the fear card again and they're playing the card as a trial balloon because there's going to be real reasons for fear coming down the road.
[03:43:05.141 --> 03:43:07.752]  Okay, I want to go back to calls, but I wanted to bring up another subject.
[03:43:08.803 --> 03:43:19.406]  Back in January of last year, a year and a half ago, or almost a year and a half ago, we got State of New York, Bureau of Cemeteries internal documents.
[03:43:19.406 --> 03:43:29.489]  We had emergency managers on, saying they're preparing in Indiana and Illinois for millions of dead, that the flu was coming, it was going to kill millions, and that the feds had to take over and have martial law.
[03:43:29.489 --> 03:43:30.849]  We got the documents.
[03:43:30.849 --> 03:43:31.629]  I warned the people.
[03:43:31.629 --> 03:43:36.131]  Then in April, out of the wrong season, wrong hemisphere, H1N1 pops up.
[03:43:37.791 --> 03:43:48.119]  I go on air and I say, I don't know if this is going to be real or not, whether it's real flu or not, it's psychological terrorism, just like if it's a real nuke attack or not, it's psychological terrorism.
[03:43:48.119 --> 03:44:01.808]  Then the head of the EU Health Commission, 47-member group, Wolfgang Wudrig, we had him on, documented that they paid off the scientists in our governments, had them lie to make tens of billions on sales.
[03:44:01.808 --> 03:44:06.011]  You talked about it being a fraud, I talked about it, here it is, the Daily Mail,
[03:44:06.892 --> 03:44:09.875]  We blundered over swine flu admit health chiefs.
[03:44:09.875 --> 03:44:16.640]  Global health chiefs have finally admitted that they may have overreacted to swine flu pandemic, landing governments with millions of unused vaccines.
[03:44:16.640 --> 03:44:17.801]  That's the whitewash.
[03:44:17.801 --> 03:44:24.407]  But there we are again, right about the fact that H1N1 was a hoax, but that it was genetically engineered.
[03:44:24.407 --> 03:44:25.308]  That's been confirmed.
[03:44:25.928 --> 03:44:32.717]  And that if you took the seasonal flu shot, that's what gave you the H1N1, they were putting it in the vaccines.
[03:44:32.717 --> 03:44:39.265]  That's in five new studies that they were actually... I mean, this is so diabolical, it's right out in the open and nobody gets in trouble.
[03:44:40.094 --> 03:44:43.116]  Well, look what's going on with the pharmaceutical companies.
[03:44:43.116 --> 03:44:54.345]  They hire doctors, and they pay the doctors to do the research, and then the doctors become spokespersons for the pharmaceutical industry, and they make up fake studies.
[03:44:54.345 --> 03:44:56.067]  I mean, how much more proof do you need?
[03:44:56.067 --> 03:45:01.791]  Hey, ladies, remember all of that estrogen they told you to take for how many years?
[03:45:02.552 --> 03:45:13.227]  And then the people that were saying that it was dangerous for you, and it wasn't doing the things that they claimed it was doing, they would, they would, you know, run them into the ground.
[03:45:13.227 --> 03:45:17.312]  So yeah, it's every level, and again, keep making the connections.
[03:45:17.853 --> 03:45:19.454]  You know, it's the same thing.
[03:45:19.454 --> 03:45:21.895]  It's the pharmaceutical companies.
[03:45:21.895 --> 03:45:24.075]  It's big agriculture.
[03:45:24.075 --> 03:45:25.756]  It's big banks.
[03:45:25.756 --> 03:45:27.217]  And it's the Great War.
[03:45:27.217 --> 03:45:28.637]  It all adds up.
[03:45:28.637 --> 03:45:31.398]  It all goes into the same direction.
[03:45:31.398 --> 03:45:35.760]  World War II, World War I, and the war coming up.
[03:45:35.760 --> 03:45:37.761]  It's a war of profits.
[03:45:37.761 --> 03:45:39.221]  They'll kill anybody.
[03:45:39.221 --> 03:45:40.682]  They'll do anything.
[03:45:40.682 --> 03:45:44.223]  As I said before, they're nothing more than money
[03:45:44.603 --> 03:45:50.125]  Okay, Gerald Cilente, I want to race through calls and questions now in the last 12-14 minutes we have left here.
[03:45:50.125 --> 03:46:02.550]  The revolt of the states, that's a Twitter question, states moving to sue, states talking about secession, even Rick Perry talking about it, declaring 10th Amendment, where do you see that going?
[03:46:02.990 --> 03:46:03.671]  Oh, definitely.
[03:46:03.671 --> 03:46:05.492]  We wrote about this years ago.
[03:46:05.492 --> 03:46:07.673]  Secessionism's a real movement.
[03:46:07.673 --> 03:46:12.477]  We can see the United States breaking up like the former Soviet Union.
[03:46:12.477 --> 03:46:14.438]  The Second Vermont Republic.
[03:46:14.438 --> 03:46:15.359]  Check that one out.
[03:46:15.359 --> 03:46:17.180]  This is for real.
[03:46:17.180 --> 03:46:18.962]  And these are really intelligent guys.
[03:46:18.962 --> 03:46:20.223]  Thomas Naylor.
[03:46:20.223 --> 03:46:23.485]  I mean, this guy's, you know, Professor Emeritus from Duke University.
[03:46:23.485 --> 03:46:25.446]  There are a lot of intelligent people.
[03:46:25.446 --> 03:46:27.388]  We can see it breaking up.
[03:46:27.388 --> 03:46:30.110]  As the government grips more, the states break apart.
[03:46:30.450 --> 03:46:34.873]  Here's another question, Twitter question, from Fedros.
[03:46:34.873 --> 03:46:38.576]  It says, the Australian economy seems to follow the U.S.
[03:46:38.576 --> 03:46:39.217]  closely.
[03:46:39.217 --> 03:46:39.737]  Should the U.S.
[03:46:39.737 --> 03:46:44.180]  economy implode, what chance have we here in Oz?
[03:46:44.180 --> 03:46:47.343]  They won't get hit as bad, but they'll get everybody.
[03:46:47.343 --> 03:46:51.346]  There will be very few countries that escape it.
[03:46:51.346 --> 03:46:57.911]  The best countries that we're looking at, and they're in this Trends Journal, is Australia, Canada, Norway, New Zealand.
[03:46:58.331 --> 03:46:59.252]  Those about the top.
[03:46:59.252 --> 03:47:03.014]  And of course, Switzerland, they're the money cockroaches of the world.
[03:47:03.014 --> 03:47:04.475]  They never go anywhere.
[03:47:04.475 --> 03:47:10.659]  But they won't get hit as bad as the United States because they're not as indebted as we are.
[03:47:10.659 --> 03:47:16.523]  What do you think about state bank initiatives where we have state banks that give the public free credit?
[03:47:17.737 --> 03:47:24.619]  I don't think you give free credit at all, but what we should go back to, we believe, is the Glass-Steagall Act.
[03:47:24.619 --> 03:47:30.581]  It worked before, it saved us after the Great Depression, so the criminals couldn't do what they're doing now.
[03:47:30.581 --> 03:47:39.965]  And by the way, the things that I do personally, I put all my money, most of our money, in the community bank, in the local bank.
[03:47:39.965 --> 03:47:46.127]  I know it's sound, and I also, of course, because we're an international business, we have to have international banks.
[03:47:47.268 --> 03:47:48.769]  But they can't loan for free.
[03:47:48.769 --> 03:47:51.032]  I mean, you just can't.
[03:47:51.032 --> 03:47:51.973]  It can't work like that.
[03:47:54.025 --> 03:47:57.946]  What do you see with the population and the relationship with police?
[03:47:57.946 --> 03:48:15.949]  Now because of all these tiny handheld cameras built into cell phones, iPads, you name it, iPhones, we're really seeing police walk up, beat innocent people half to death, throw legless men out of wheelchairs, going crazy and being encouraged to do it, and now the public's really getting to see this.
[03:48:15.949 --> 03:48:20.010]  Where do you see that going and where do you see the attempt to clamp down on free speech on the internet going?
[03:48:21.132 --> 03:48:25.294]  Well, they are clamping down on free speech.
[03:48:25.294 --> 03:48:27.334]  They're going to continue to clamp down.
[03:48:27.334 --> 03:48:35.838]  We just saw that federal court ruling that was in favor of a Comcast, where they can now
[03:48:36.838 --> 03:48:41.539]  Charge different prices for different clients to give them different speeds.
[03:48:41.539 --> 03:48:43.600]  That may come about in the future.
[03:48:43.600 --> 03:48:46.941]  So net neutrality is really under attack.
[03:48:46.941 --> 03:48:51.542]  As far as the police, the police are becoming like goon squads for the bankers.
[03:48:51.542 --> 03:48:57.784]  And that's what happens when a nation goes from first class to third world.
[03:48:57.784 --> 03:49:00.205]  They beat you into submission.
[03:49:00.205 --> 03:49:03.266]  And that's what's going on in the United States more and more.
[03:49:04.721 --> 03:49:06.782]  Let's jam in a phone call here.
[03:49:06.782 --> 03:49:10.343]  Up next is Pamela in Wisconsin, then Jim, Paul, and Chuck.
[03:49:10.343 --> 03:49:11.244]  We'll at least get to those.
[03:49:11.244 --> 03:49:16.326]  Jim, go ahead.
[03:49:16.326 --> 03:49:17.346]  Hey, Jim, we're on the air.
[03:49:17.346 --> 03:49:17.946]  How you doing, buddy?
[03:49:17.946 --> 03:49:20.987]  Okay, go to Paul in Tennessee.
[03:49:20.987 --> 03:49:21.628]  Go ahead, Paul.
[03:49:21.628 --> 03:49:24.009]  You're on the air.
[03:49:24.009 --> 03:49:24.849]  Hey, are you there?
[03:49:24.849 --> 03:49:25.249]  Yes, sir.
[03:49:25.249 --> 03:49:25.629]  Go ahead.
[03:49:25.629 --> 03:49:27.470]  All right.
[03:49:27.470 --> 03:49:32.712]  I hear you people talking all the time about God, gold, and guns.
[03:49:33.294 --> 03:49:34.235]  My question is this.
[03:49:34.235 --> 03:49:46.431]  Now, the thing is, okay, buying gold would be a wise investment, but my question is, if these people have this gold, and the dollar's only worth, as far as I know, maybe four cents, why would they sell their gold?
[03:49:47.535 --> 03:49:50.416]  Well, no, you won't.
[03:49:50.416 --> 03:50:02.782]  There'll be inflation of the dollar, so instead of getting $1,000 an ounce, you might get $3,000 an ounce, so your gold when you sell it would convert to whatever the currency was at that time, thus protecting you from inflation.
[03:50:02.782 --> 03:50:03.502]  Gerald Cilenti.
[03:50:04.082 --> 03:50:05.683]  You said it, that's it, that's it.
[03:50:05.683 --> 03:50:12.786]  And by the way, my strategy is personally, I'm heavily invested in gold and have been for years.
[03:50:12.786 --> 03:50:16.447]  I also buy Swiss francs, Canadian dollars, and U.S.
[03:50:16.447 --> 03:50:29.033]  dollars because in that play, all I want to do is to stay even and gold is my wild card because I believe that they're going to devalue the dollar rather than it inflating.
[03:50:29.033 --> 03:50:30.934]  In one way or another, it's not going to be worth
[03:50:31.514 --> 03:50:33.335]  It won't be able to buy a candy bar.
[03:50:33.335 --> 03:50:38.337]  And gold is up almost 400% in the last 10 years, so that was a good bet for you.
[03:50:38.337 --> 03:50:43.140]  Well, yeah, and we believe it's going to hit 2,000 and beyond.
[03:50:43.140 --> 03:50:46.301]  Cindy, Chuck, and Eric, you are straight ahead.
[03:50:46.301 --> 03:50:49.903]  Final caller for Gerald Cilente.
[03:50:49.903 --> 03:50:52.685]  And we'll give you his website as well on the other side.
[03:50:52.685 --> 03:50:56.306]  You can see it up on the screen if you're watching at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[03:50:58.107 --> 03:50:59.248]  Final segment, straight ahead.
[03:51:03.601 --> 03:51:05.602]  Remain in your houses.
[03:51:05.602 --> 03:51:11.386]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[03:51:11.386 --> 03:51:12.747]  Will they do it?
[03:51:12.747 --> 03:51:15.349]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[03:51:15.349 --> 03:51:21.814]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[03:51:21.814 --> 03:51:24.015]  Think it can't happen here?
[03:51:24.015 --> 03:51:26.037]  Executive Order 10990 locks down all highways.
[03:51:28.278 --> 03:51:33.160]  Executive Order 10995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[03:51:33.160 --> 03:51:38.062]  Executive Order 10998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[03:51:38.062 --> 03:51:43.824]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[03:51:43.824 --> 03:51:52.228]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to martiallawsurvival.com.

[03:52:06.244 --> 03:52:07.504]  Tyranny is here.
[03:52:07.504 --> 03:52:11.365]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:52:11.365 --> 03:52:13.666]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:52:13.666 --> 03:52:19.528]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:52:19.528 --> 03:52:26.189]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:52:26.189 --> 03:52:32.151]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:52:32.151 --> 03:52:35.812]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[03:52:36.352 --> 03:52:40.634]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:52:40.634 --> 03:52:46.575]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:52:46.575 --> 03:52:50.137]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:52:50.137 --> 03:52:52.117]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:52:52.117 --> 03:52:53.238]  It's here.

[03:54:24.879 --> 03:54:27.881]  It has to do with this iPad you see right here.
[03:54:27.881 --> 03:54:29.062]  Something that's gonna be happening
[03:54:29.762 --> 03:54:34.983]  With this, tomorrow on the show, you do not want to miss it.
[03:54:34.983 --> 03:54:37.504]  Jamming in three final calls for Gerald Cilente.
[03:54:37.504 --> 03:54:41.464]  We really appreciate the Top Trends forecaster spending almost two hours with us today.
[03:54:41.464 --> 03:54:43.305]  Chuck in Vegas, you're on the air.
[03:54:43.305 --> 03:54:43.725]  Go ahead.
[03:54:43.725 --> 03:54:46.065]  Hi Alex, nice to speak to you.
[03:54:46.065 --> 03:54:51.247]  I wanted to quickly just say, I've been listening to your show for a little more than a year now.
[03:54:51.247 --> 03:54:56.728]  It was a breath of fresh air to be able to get the information that you have.
[03:54:56.728 --> 03:54:57.948]  It's something that I've been
[03:54:58.588 --> 03:55:03.252]  They use the environment, they use bugs, they use war all as a pretext to take control of our lives.
[03:55:25.353 --> 03:55:34.157]  Yeah, but my main comment is, now, my Facebook page is nothing, no BS, it's nothing but informative information.
[03:55:34.157 --> 03:55:39.439]  I either get links from you or other, the Drudge Report, other... Sure, we're almost out of time, go ahead.
[03:55:39.439 --> 03:55:42.941]  Okay, my thing is, what do we do to wake people up?
[03:55:42.941 --> 03:55:53.265]  Like, even in my own household, I speak to my wife about this stuff, and I can engage her shortly, but her spend, I mean, she's more concerned about Jesse James and that whole...
[03:55:53.365 --> 03:55:57.906]  Chuck, Chuck, there's some people, love them to death, aren't ever concerned.
[03:55:57.906 --> 03:56:08.809]  It's like in the Godfather, they say, you know, women and children can be careless, men cannot be careless, and a lot of men act like women, and a lot of women act like men, but let's talk to Gerald Cilente about that.
[03:56:08.809 --> 03:56:11.529]  I would move on to people that do want to be warned.
[03:56:11.529 --> 03:56:14.410]  5% started this country, Gerald Cilente.
[03:56:14.890 --> 03:56:15.831]  Well, that's it.
[03:56:15.831 --> 03:56:17.972]  There's about 20% could change the whole country.
[03:56:17.972 --> 03:56:20.174]  We believe there's 20% that'll move.
[03:56:20.174 --> 03:56:23.877]  There's a great quote attributed to Jesus Christ.
[03:56:23.877 --> 03:56:25.118]  I can heal the sick.
[03:56:25.118 --> 03:56:27.760]  I can make the blind see the lame walk.
[03:56:27.760 --> 03:56:29.341]  I can even raise the dead.
[03:56:29.341 --> 03:56:35.426]  But I, not even I, can save a fool from their foolishness.
[03:56:35.426 --> 03:56:36.046]  Absolutely.
[03:56:36.046 --> 03:56:37.167]  So just move on, Chuck.
[03:56:37.167 --> 03:56:38.568]  I mean, try to educate your wife.
[03:56:38.568 --> 03:56:41.831]  As things get worse, she'll listen to you later.
[03:56:41.831 --> 03:56:43.412]  Erica, North Carolina, you're on the air.
[03:56:43.412 --> 03:56:44.373]  Quick question for Gerald.
[03:56:44.844 --> 03:56:45.645]  Yeah, thanks a lot.
[03:56:45.645 --> 03:56:53.293]  Listen, real quick, is the central point behind all these scams and frauds and tricks is the complicit media.
[03:56:53.293 --> 03:56:55.876]  Why aren't they the central target of our effort?
[03:56:55.876 --> 03:56:59.340]  Because without the corrupt media, so many people wouldn't be fooled.
[03:56:59.340 --> 03:57:04.526]  Well, the media is all losing their viewers and falling apart, so they want to shut down our free space, which was a kick in their butt.
[03:57:04.526 --> 03:57:04.866]  Gerald?
[03:57:05.447 --> 03:57:05.987]  That's it.
[03:57:05.987 --> 03:57:10.009]  The biggest trend that we're writing about is going to be internet TV.
[03:57:10.009 --> 03:57:22.074]  Everything you see on that little screen now goes to the big screen and they're really fearful of that because they can't keep up and compare with the content coming from an Alex Jones.
[03:57:22.074 --> 03:57:24.975]  You're not going to see that on CNN.
[03:57:24.975 --> 03:57:29.677]  So that's the real fear and that's why they're going to clamp down on the media in the future.
[03:57:30.037 --> 03:57:31.277]  Well, here's an example.
[03:57:31.277 --> 03:57:36.879]  I mean, Gerald Salente's on Fox, CNN, you name it, but here you get to hear in-depth two hours.
[03:57:36.879 --> 03:57:41.821]  I mean, and here he can really, you know, break things down in detail.
[03:57:41.821 --> 03:57:42.461]  Thank you, Eric.
[03:57:42.461 --> 03:57:44.502]  Real quick, Brad in California.
[03:57:44.502 --> 03:57:44.842]  Go ahead.
[03:57:47.475 --> 03:57:49.837]  I've got some property in Argentina.
[03:57:49.837 --> 03:57:54.282]  Actually, I was wondering if you think that's a good safe country to be in when all this stuff goes down.
[03:57:54.282 --> 03:57:55.263]  Absolutely not!
[03:57:55.263 --> 03:57:56.704]  We'll get Gerald's opinion.
[03:57:56.704 --> 03:57:57.685]  Run by the bankers.
[03:57:57.685 --> 03:57:59.607]  They're grabbing your pension funds right now.
[03:57:59.607 --> 03:58:00.428]  Gerald?
[03:58:00.428 --> 03:58:02.510]  I just got back from Argentina.
[03:58:02.510 --> 03:58:04.131]  Coming in from Chile.
[03:58:04.131 --> 03:58:06.173]  I don't know if you know, I was there during the earthquake in Chile.
[03:58:07.325 --> 03:58:20.014]  And, uh, you know, when we came over, all of a sudden, a couple of times, they had these roadblocks with helicopters and guys dressed with enough body armor to go through the Battle of the Bulge.
[03:58:20.014 --> 03:58:21.915]  No, it's a place that's on the edge.
[03:58:21.915 --> 03:58:27.338]  But I would say also that, you know, I wouldn't buy anything anywhere.
[03:58:27.338 --> 03:58:31.821]  I would just go someplace and check it out, stay there a while.
[03:58:31.821 --> 03:58:34.023]  You don't have to buy anything.
[03:58:34.023 --> 03:58:35.304]  Gerald, we're out of time.
[03:58:35.304 --> 03:58:36.104]  We're out of time.
[03:58:36.104 --> 03:58:36.825]  Great job.
[03:58:37.585 --> 03:58:38.245]  God bless you.
[03:58:38.245 --> 03:58:39.306]  Thank you.
[03:58:39.306 --> 03:58:40.306]  Thank you.
[03:58:40.306 --> 03:58:41.326]  We'll be right back.
