[00:00:04.073 --> 00:00:04.733]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.374 --> 00:00:06.415]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.156 --> 00:00:08.277]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:08.917 --> 00:00:09.718]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:11.459]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.683]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.244 --> 00:00:20.288]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.676 --> 00:00:22.217]  We're live.
[00:00:22.257 --> 00:00:25.742]  It's Wednesday, the 23rd day of June 2010.
[00:00:26.202 --> 00:00:28.686]  Got two hours left in the radio broadcast.
[00:00:28.946 --> 00:00:32.331]  We are now simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:00:32.471 --> 00:00:35.636]  For PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[00:00:38.777 --> 00:00:46.664]  Okay, what I'm going to do now is continue in this little short segment with a few calls, and then a news blitz for at least two segments coming up.
[00:00:47.284 --> 00:00:57.453]  And then we'll continue with calls until Dr. John Coleman joins us in the last hour, author, researcher, to give us his take on the Iran situation, the oil spill, McChrystal, all of it.
[00:00:58.094 --> 00:01:01.937]  He also, of course, was with MI6, so that's coming up in the last hour.
[00:01:01.977 --> 00:01:03.578]  And we'll open phones then as well.
[00:01:06.872 --> 00:01:12.213]  Pat, Joanne, Craig, and we're going to get to all of you here in the next few segments.
[00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:17.074]  Let's go ahead and talk to, let's talk to Craig first at WIFL.
[00:01:17.875 --> 00:01:20.955]  More and more, I'm going to start trying to get listeners to tell us how they're listening.
[00:01:20.975 --> 00:01:25.036]  You know, in the past I would do that, whether it was AM, FM, shortwave, internet, satellite.
[00:01:25.116 --> 00:01:28.017]  Over the years, we just quit asking how people are calling in.
[00:01:28.757 --> 00:01:31.298]  So, but if you'd like to tell us how you're listening, that's always good.
[00:01:31.318 --> 00:01:40.562]  We want to plug all these great affiliates, WIFL, 100.4, .2, I don't think they have .2's, don't they have odd numbers?
[00:01:40.842 --> 00:01:44.443]  But whatever, 100.4 there in Florida.
[00:01:45.023 --> 00:01:46.304]  Craig, good to have you on with us.
[00:01:47.144 --> 00:01:48.044]  Hi Alex, it's 104.3.
[00:01:49.855 --> 00:01:52.978]  Listen, first of all, I want to talk about McChrystal.
[00:01:53.418 --> 00:01:58.302]  I heard Michael Savage last night say he used to work for the CFR, which I find troubling.
[00:01:58.342 --> 00:02:00.183]  What's your thoughts on that one?
[00:02:01.284 --> 00:02:03.526]  Well, everybody hates Obama, which is good.
[00:02:03.646 --> 00:02:04.887]  I mean, they built him up as God.
[00:02:04.907 --> 00:02:05.607]  He's not God.
[00:02:05.627 --> 00:02:08.530]  He's basically a cocaine head from Indonesia.
[00:02:11.141 --> 00:02:17.326]  It's important to tear down that image because the globalists could use him as a messianic leader and they tried it, it failed.
[00:02:18.266 --> 00:02:22.569]  So everybody wants to look at McChrystal as good because he did want more troops to actually win the war.
[00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.131]  The war is being won.
[00:02:24.191 --> 00:02:28.013]  People always want to win the drug war as there's triple the heroin.
[00:02:29.034 --> 00:02:32.716]  Double the cocaine flooding in now than what there was 20 years ago.
[00:02:33.396 --> 00:02:34.597]  There's more people in prison.
[00:02:34.777 --> 00:02:36.137]  The drug war is a great success.
[00:02:36.197 --> 00:02:39.379]  The government's shipping most of it in, laundering the money through private banks.
[00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:48.583]  And so McChrystal has been in control and is so bold, he gave the orders to admit that we are guarding poppies and helping grow it.
[00:02:49.843 --> 00:02:53.205]  And McChrystal, from my research, is a globalist.
[00:02:54.178 --> 00:03:00.184]  And I've also seen him trying to integrate women into frontline roles, which is just, it's a joke, folks, okay?
[00:03:00.605 --> 00:03:02.887]  I mean, women aren't supposed to be in frontline combat.
[00:03:03.348 --> 00:03:04.069]  Nobody does it.
[00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.709]  It doesn't work.
[00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:05.590]  It's, it's, it's...
[00:03:06.494 --> 00:03:09.516]  Men act differently when they see a woman's head blown off and they do another man.
[00:03:09.936 --> 00:03:11.197]  It's just isn't the way things are done.
[00:03:11.938 --> 00:03:14.499]  And so I particularly, from looking at him, don't like McChrystal.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:23.525]  You know, I know Savage, because I happened to tune in last night driving home, was calling him a great Spartan and, you know, an incredible guy and Obama's uncomfortable around him.
[00:03:23.785 --> 00:03:25.727]  Well, I'm sure Obama is uncomfortable around him.
[00:03:26.127 --> 00:03:28.208]  I mean, I'm sure McChrystal's better than Obama.
[00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:33.652]  And I didn't... I mean, anybody that's that high level as a general is going to have a problem.
[00:03:33.932 --> 00:03:34.653]  Fox Fallon
[00:03:35.273 --> 00:03:37.815]  You know, the head of CENTCOM refused to attack Iran.
[00:03:38.115 --> 00:03:38.836]  And that came out.
[00:03:38.876 --> 00:03:41.058]  I mean, he was a good guy from what we saw.
[00:03:41.398 --> 00:03:42.940]  They've had some other people step down.
[00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.302]  And I don't really want to judge him because I don't know enough about him.
[00:03:49.965 --> 00:03:50.566]  I mean, I don't know.
[00:03:50.606 --> 00:03:51.206]  What do you think?
[00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:56.051]  I think this is all, like, I want to use your word, staged.
[00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:58.012]  I think this is all planned on his part.
[00:03:58.733 --> 00:03:59.754]  And follow me on this.
[00:04:00.234 --> 00:04:03.397]  I think he did this little thing in Rolling Stone on purpose
[00:04:04.284 --> 00:04:07.946]  To get himself fired by the Democrat.
[00:04:07.966 --> 00:04:11.067]  This is where it kind of looks like the bad cop, good cop routine.
[00:04:11.527 --> 00:04:14.929]  Where, look at that, Obama fired a General.
[00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:19.851]  And I think McChrystal's plan is to run for President.
[00:04:19.951 --> 00:04:22.312]  Because, think about it, the Republicans don't have nobody.
[00:04:22.332 --> 00:04:23.392]  They keep talking about Gingrich.
[00:04:23.792 --> 00:04:24.813]  He'll never get elected.
[00:04:24.833 --> 00:04:26.173]  They're going to keep talking about Romney.
[00:04:26.454 --> 00:04:27.194]  He's unelectable.
[00:04:27.254 --> 00:04:29.395]  Petraeus isn't going to get elected after that seizure.
[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.001]  We know they've been talking about a Mitt Romney-Petraeus ticket.
[00:04:34.021 --> 00:04:34.361]  Go ahead.
[00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:36.561]  Okay, well, that's just my thought.
[00:04:36.581 --> 00:04:38.742]  Maybe I think it might have been done on purpose.
[00:04:38.802 --> 00:04:41.343]  Oh, well, sir, I totally agree with you.
[00:04:41.403 --> 00:04:43.143]  There is no doubt this was done on purpose.
[00:04:43.584 --> 00:04:46.224]  I mean, McChrystal isn't an idiot.
[00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:51.746]  I mean, he told Rolling Stone Magazine all of this and knew full well it was going to be published.
[00:04:52.006 --> 00:04:52.846]  So I agree with you.
[00:04:53.347 --> 00:04:56.828]  This is staged and he wanted out of the military and probably to run for president.
[00:04:57.208 --> 00:04:57.888]  Great point.
[00:04:59.602 --> 00:05:02.203]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:02.623 --> 00:05:07.566]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:07.946 --> 00:05:09.667]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:09.987 --> 00:05:14.809]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:14.989 --> 00:05:15.949]  How much do you want?
[00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.890]  When do you want it?
[00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:18.892]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:19.172 --> 00:05:19.993]  When will you need it?
[00:05:20.253 --> 00:05:22.316]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:22.456 --> 00:05:23.557]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:23.777 --> 00:05:25.118]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:30.384]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:30.584 --> 00:05:33.768]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:34.168 --> 00:05:37.632]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:37.972 --> 00:05:38.953]  How much will you need?
[00:05:39.213 --> 00:05:39.834]  We don't know.
[00:05:40.114 --> 00:05:41.015]  How much do you want?
[00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:41.956]  All you can get.
[00:05:42.137 --> 00:05:42.998]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:43.238 --> 00:05:46.001]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:05:46.281 --> 00:05:46.642]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:05:46.822 --> 00:05:48.924]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:49.144 --> 00:05:49.905]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:03.533]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:06:03.653 --> 00:06:04.413]  What have we got?
[00:06:04.653 --> 00:06:06.755]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:07.796]  A republic.
[00:06:08.096 --> 00:06:10.658]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:06:10.738 --> 00:06:12.639]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.901]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:16.302]  So they think they own our land?
[00:06:16.702 --> 00:06:17.823]  They think they own our water?
[00:06:18.023 --> 00:06:18.424]  Children?
[00:06:18.624 --> 00:06:19.424]  Our education?
[00:06:19.745 --> 00:06:20.365]  Our money?
[00:06:20.585 --> 00:06:24.228]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:06:24.588 --> 00:06:29.234]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:06:29.554 --> 00:06:30.375]  We have the facts.
[00:06:30.595 --> 00:06:31.696]  We have the Constitution.
[00:06:31.736 --> 00:06:32.638]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:06:32.658 --> 00:06:33.479]  We have common law.
[00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:35.801]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:39.846]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:06:39.946 --> 00:06:44.729]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:46.270]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:06:46.391 --> 00:06:47.231]  Don't tread on me.
[00:06:47.491 --> 00:06:54.356]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.

[00:08:02.713 --> 00:08:05.595]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:08.796 --> 00:08:12.878]  Okay, we're now eight minutes into this third hour.
[00:08:12.918 --> 00:08:21.683]  Your phone calls are coming up at 1-800-259-9231 on this live Wednesday, June 23rd, 2010 edition.
[00:08:22.163 --> 00:08:25.825]  Let's go over some of the most important headlines of the day.
[00:08:29.963 --> 00:08:35.927]  Well, the government's pleading with President to allow work to continue, WDSU Television.
[00:08:35.967 --> 00:08:43.111]  The federal government is shutting down the dredging that was being done to create protective sand berms in the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:08:43.531 --> 00:08:47.333]  The berms are meant to protect the Louisiana coastline from oil, but the U.S.
[00:08:47.373 --> 00:08:52.677]  Fish and Wildlife Department has concerns about where the dredging is being done.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:59.582]  And so leaders of different parishes and others are pleading with the federal government to stop blocking them.
[00:08:59.982 --> 00:09:09.125]  Once again, our government resource agencies, which were intended to protect us, are now leaving us vulnerable to destruction of our coastline and marshes by the impending oil.
[00:09:09.565 --> 00:09:16.448]  Because the government is all about following the orders of those above you, so that the globalists can control society.
[00:09:16.888 --> 00:09:19.269]  How does this dovetail with the airline story?
[00:09:20.009 --> 00:09:27.746]  I saw an article about a flight from Europe to New Jersey, to Newark, on the 16-hour flight.
[00:09:28.167 --> 00:09:29.269]  It was over 100 degrees.
[00:09:31.397 --> 00:09:33.418]  for much of the flight and people were panicking.
[00:09:34.559 --> 00:09:51.490]  And I always hear about these articles about how they're under international and national regulations where a plane will be on the tarmac for four, five, six, sometimes 24 hours, and they can't open the door to let the hot air out or to let new oxygen in because of a TSA regulation.
[00:09:51.891 --> 00:09:54.713]  I mean, we are crippled by regulations.
[00:09:54.753 --> 00:09:58.435]  And you go to China, there are almost no regulations, so all the industry goes there.
[00:09:59.176 --> 00:10:00.657]  And this is all done by design.
[00:10:01.857 --> 00:10:08.723]  But every day we see articles where they can't put dredge boats out there because the feds say no and the Coast Guard says no.
[00:10:09.103 --> 00:10:12.385]  Or where they can't block the estuary so the oil doesn't come in.
[00:10:12.425 --> 00:10:17.589]  And most of the oil, according to the NASA photographs, is still out in the Gulf and going towards Florida.
[00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:19.230]  Most of it hasn't hit yet.
[00:10:19.651 --> 00:10:26.696]  And so there's still time to block these estuaries and rivers and lakes that this oil is going to back up in and get into.
[00:10:26.756 --> 00:10:30.179]  But the federal government is doing everything they can right now to stop that.
[00:10:30.819 --> 00:10:35.426]  Because the bigger the crisis, the more power and control these people are going to get.
[00:10:35.446 --> 00:10:41.755]  It's just so sad to see this.
[00:10:43.237 --> 00:10:45.838]  To see all of this just intensifying.
[00:10:46.198 --> 00:10:48.580]  Let's get into some economic news here.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.400]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:59.025]  Now remember, they've been telling you for three years that the recession is going to go away and that the prosperity is right around the corner or that we've reached prosperity.
[00:10:59.645 --> 00:11:00.725]  The real unemployment is above 22%.
[00:11:03.426 --> 00:11:05.208]  Inflation's higher than what they say.
[00:11:05.669 --> 00:11:14.277]  Anybody who is out in the free market and not working for government, where government jobs are up, pays up for government, that is if it's federal government.
[00:11:16.297 --> 00:11:20.581]  New home sales plunge 33% with tax credits gone.
[00:11:21.922 --> 00:11:26.306]  New home sales dropped to the lowest level on record in May after federal homebuyer tax credit ends.
[00:11:26.927 --> 00:11:35.735]  And I've got another story here where the Democratic Congress has now made the decision to cut the middle class tax cuts that Obama promised.
[00:11:36.756 --> 00:11:39.058]  And next you'll hear there are actually going to be tax increases.
[00:11:39.778 --> 00:11:48.805]  But the tax increases on the middle class and the wealthy will just be a tax increase on the working class because people will just lay off more employees or cut their pay.
[00:11:49.786 --> 00:11:51.047]  But new home sales plunge.
[00:11:51.608 --> 00:12:03.497]  Sales of new homes collapsed in May, sinking 33% to the lowest level on record as potential buyers stopped shopping for homes once they could no longer receive government tax credits.
[00:12:05.708 --> 00:12:08.929]  Continuing, JPMorgan sets sights overseas.
[00:12:08.969 --> 00:12:16.852]  New York Times, JPMorgan Chase emerged from the financial crisis as one of the strongest banks on American soil.
[00:12:17.292 --> 00:12:22.534]  Now it wants to make up lost ground overseas.
[00:12:23.294 --> 00:12:29.285]  The bank chief executive, Jamie Dimon, announced a series of management changes towards the end on Tuesday.
[00:12:29.305 --> 00:12:33.733]  So they've sucked America Drive, the locusts are moving on to other fields.
[00:12:37.506 --> 00:12:37.786]  Yeah.
[00:12:38.407 --> 00:12:39.087]  Oh, yeah.
[00:12:39.227 --> 00:12:44.911]  The big central banks, the big insiders, they're all making record profits right now.
[00:12:44.971 --> 00:12:46.652]  They're doing quite well.
[00:12:47.172 --> 00:12:49.234]  But the rest of the economy is in freefall.
[00:12:49.574 --> 00:12:52.716]  I mentioned this yesterday, but I thought I'd actually get into the headline today.
[00:12:53.076 --> 00:13:04.964]  Lord Rothschild Fund joins World Gold Council to put 12.5 million pounds of gold bullion into vault, or 12.5 million worth.
[00:13:06.605 --> 00:13:07.826]  The article should say it.
[00:13:08.567 --> 00:13:12.410]  That could be misinterpreted as 12.5 million physical pounds.
[00:13:13.911 --> 00:13:14.952]  And it goes on.
[00:13:15.533 --> 00:13:16.494]  It goes on from there.
[00:13:16.534 --> 00:13:23.179]  So the elites... I saw another article two days ago where the Saudi Royal House has doubled its gold holdings.
[00:13:23.239 --> 00:13:27.023]  That's one reason gold continues to go up and up and up.
[00:13:28.843 --> 00:13:29.883]  Here's one out of the L.A.
[00:13:29.963 --> 00:13:30.503]  Times.
[00:13:30.563 --> 00:13:31.163]  Of course, the L.A.
[00:13:31.184 --> 00:13:42.066]  Times had a story a month ago about the state government is announcing, along with the city government of L.A., that they're no longer going to pave many roads or streets or fix sidewalks.
[00:13:42.646 --> 00:13:46.046]  All money must go to interest on the debt to the bankers.
[00:13:46.427 --> 00:13:46.867]  All money.
[00:13:47.887 --> 00:13:53.508]  It says Maywood to lay off all city employees, dismantle police department.
[00:13:54.699 --> 00:13:59.660]  So, record taxes, record regulations, and less government that actually provides a service.
[00:14:01.141 --> 00:14:06.062]  I mean, in Nigeria, they pay almost all their taxes to the IMF and World Bank.
[00:14:06.182 --> 00:14:06.982]  Nothing to the people.
[00:14:09.103 --> 00:14:13.224]  It's the same thing in Costa Rica, or Argentina, or places where these bankers run things.
[00:14:14.654 --> 00:14:20.543]  Continuing here, of course, Costa Rica hasn't been fully imploded yet, but they're gonna get around to it, don't worry.
[00:14:21.164 --> 00:14:30.277]  I mentioned this yesterday, it was all over the Australian news, that yes, the government will make you install software that censors what you can view,
[00:14:31.417 --> 00:14:37.821]  But also tracks what you're doing with messages back in the software, down line, back to the government servers.
[00:14:38.402 --> 00:14:48.969]  And of course, here the FCC announced last week, and it was in the Financial Times of London and NAB, that we'll have a black box with software in our house that tracks everything we do.
[00:14:49.869 --> 00:14:53.151]  But not only will it track everything that we do,
[00:14:54.972 --> 00:14:56.913]  It will also restrict what we can see.
[00:14:57.673 --> 00:15:04.156]  So it's interesting to see the government telling the truth about what they're doing brazenly, but to see the media spinning it.
[00:15:04.256 --> 00:15:08.618]  And here's an article out of the News of Australia where they spin it.
[00:15:09.478 --> 00:15:12.860]  No antivirus software, no internet connection.
[00:15:13.917 --> 00:15:29.492]  And they tell you, oh, it's this special government-approved software, and more and more, even outside of government control, it's these government software systems and government-approved software systems that restrict where you can go on the web, what you can visit, and they're reporting back.
[00:15:30.473 --> 00:15:35.035]  A lot of the software will ask, oh, your Yahoo Messenger failed, or oh, your antivirus failed.
[00:15:35.055 --> 00:15:38.117]  Would you like to report back what, you know, to the virus company?
[00:15:38.437 --> 00:15:41.779]  And people just click yes, and it sends all your information.
[00:15:42.019 --> 00:15:44.060]  But now under this, no.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.762]  Here in the U.S., Australia, Europe, places like Italy, it doesn't matter.
[00:15:48.802 --> 00:15:49.663]  They're just going to do it.
[00:15:51.187 --> 00:16:01.496]  Australians would be forced to install antivirus and firewall software on their computers, and of course then that's government designed, before being allowed to connect to the internet under a new plan to fight cybercrime.
[00:16:01.917 --> 00:16:06.340]  Now of course, separately, the government admits this is quote, stronger than Chinese style net censorship.
[00:16:07.081 --> 00:16:15.609]  And if their computer did get infected, internet service providers like Telstra and Optus would cut off their connection until the problem was resolved.
[00:16:16.584 --> 00:16:22.606]  So, see, now these big ISPs under government control, they're in your computer watching what's going on.
[00:16:24.107 --> 00:16:28.528]  What did John McCain say four years ago he wanted if you, quote, downloaded questionable material?
[00:16:28.668 --> 00:16:30.789]  They would, quote, kill your computer remotely.
[00:16:31.069 --> 00:16:32.089]  That's where this is going.
[00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:35.471]  Where your computer is nothing but a terminal tied into government.
[00:16:35.651 --> 00:16:37.891]  Where your cell phone is a terminal tied into government.
[00:16:38.512 --> 00:16:39.432]  That's cyber security.
[00:16:39.652 --> 00:16:41.433]  And the same system is being implemented worldwide.
[00:16:42.373 --> 00:16:55.486]  Then they're going to use all these firewalls and sluggish things they're adding to bankrupt and screw up the old web and force you onto Internet 2, where you publicly register and go through their systems, that it's going to be super high-speed connection.
[00:16:55.747 --> 00:16:56.728]  And they won't ask you.
[00:16:57.008 --> 00:17:03.374]  When they come out to install your new cable or your new TiVo or your new system, your new Netflix,
[00:17:04.335 --> 00:17:09.808]  It will just be in the software that you're not allowed to visit InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:17:09.848 --> 00:17:11.512]  I mean, that's in the FCC announcements.
[00:17:11.752 --> 00:17:12.995]  Do you realize how big this is?
[00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:23.918]  Those are two of the recommendations that come from a year-long inquiry into cybercrime by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications.
[00:17:24.239 --> 00:17:28.564]  Notice England the same week made the announcement and said the same thing, and the same week the U.S.
[00:17:28.604 --> 00:17:29.365]  government announces.
[00:17:30.166 --> 00:17:32.810]  We found porn and hacking and crime on the web.
[00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:35.953]  We're going to control your computer and all the ISPs.
[00:17:38.578 --> 00:17:41.462]  The White House will have a kill switch on any part of the internet at once.
[00:17:42.063 --> 00:17:44.226]  And, Laberman says, what's wrong with that?
[00:17:44.366 --> 00:17:45.207]  China can do it.
[00:17:45.528 --> 00:17:50.354]  We've got to be able to do this if we're in a war, and they're gearing up for the Iran attack right now.
[00:17:50.995 --> 00:17:53.899]  I mean, do you see what they're doing, ladies and gentlemen, how bold this is?
[00:17:55.765 --> 00:18:05.908]  In the past decade, cyber crime has grown from a nuisance of the cyber market hacker into an organized transnational crime committed for vast profit and often with devastating consequences for its victims.
[00:18:06.328 --> 00:18:09.989]  And there is a lot of real crime on the web, but most of it's government and big corporations.
[00:18:10.309 --> 00:18:14.770]  And I'll guarantee you, they've war-gamed attacks on the web the Pentagon has.
[00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:16.051]  They're getting ready for false flags.
[00:18:16.711 --> 00:18:19.832]  They'll carry out the attack, use it as the pretext to take over the web.
[00:18:20.192 --> 00:18:24.113]  Because the web is killing the mainstream media, because it's offered real
[00:18:24.853 --> 00:18:29.416]  Diversity, real news and information, and real choice.
[00:18:29.816 --> 00:18:46.665]  You've got the mainstream media cheerleading and begging for the government to take over the web, and you've got the FCC saying the fees and fines from these boxes will be paid to quote support government messages in traditional, respected, trusted, that's in quotes, mainstream media.
[00:18:47.065 --> 00:18:48.406]  CBS, ABC, Fox.
[00:18:48.866 --> 00:18:56.913]  Where the government already has what they call propaganda placement, or behavior placement, where the message is not just in the ads, but in the shows themselves.
[00:18:57.053 --> 00:19:02.818]  Anti-family, anti-gun, pro-vaccine, pro-infanticide, pro-abortion, pro-world government.
[00:19:04.099 --> 00:19:08.303]  I mean, you can't even get archie comic books now for your kids, you know, for your eight-year-old.
[00:19:08.583 --> 00:19:11.846]  They want to teach them all about, not just sex, but, you know,
[00:19:15.552 --> 00:19:17.353]  You know, anti-family messages.
[00:19:17.954 --> 00:19:22.896]  Just everything is bathing the population in pure evil.
[00:19:24.998 --> 00:19:25.978]  That's what you've got to realize.
[00:19:26.138 --> 00:19:27.579]  Everything is a message.
[00:19:27.759 --> 00:19:29.520]  Everything has an agenda.
[00:19:29.741 --> 00:19:33.923]  I have an agenda for freedom and liberty and the Republic and private property and the Second Amendment.
[00:19:33.963 --> 00:19:35.784]  I wear it on my sleeve, right here.
[00:19:36.445 --> 00:19:37.325]  I wear it on my heart.
[00:19:37.665 --> 00:19:38.266]  I speak it.
[00:19:38.726 --> 00:19:39.527]  I have an agenda.
[00:19:39.607 --> 00:19:40.687]  I tell you who I am.
[00:19:40.947 --> 00:19:41.828]  I tell you what I want.
[00:19:42.068 --> 00:19:42.489]  They don't.
[00:19:42.729 --> 00:19:45.812]  They know you're relaxed watching a movie or relaxed watching a sitcom.
[00:19:46.132 --> 00:19:52.700]  You're in that suspended disbelief, unquestioning mode, eating popcorn, and they just are hitting you with brainwashing.
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.161]  Be aware of it.
[00:19:54.642 --> 00:19:58.326]  Ask yourself why you value the World Cup over private property.
[00:19:59.437 --> 00:20:08.522]  Global meltdowns, massive unemployment, endless wars, a new currency crisis, financially and morally bankrupt, a great and terrible storm is approaching.
[00:20:08.642 --> 00:20:12.004]  So what's the best way to get ready to get prepared for hard times ahead?

[00:21:59.952 --> 00:22:02.415]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnabel with MITRE'S Resources.
[00:22:02.696 --> 00:22:07.903]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation will be a direct result of the spending policy.
[00:22:08.043 --> 00:22:10.426]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[00:22:10.586 --> 00:22:13.370]  Are the majority of your assets tied up in the stock or bond market?
[00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:16.474]  If so, are those assets working for you or against you?
[00:22:16.694 --> 00:22:17.415]  One thing is certain.
[00:22:17.675 --> 00:22:24.722]  Having physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what happens to our economy or the dollar, your investment will never be worthless.
[00:22:24.942 --> 00:22:27.565]  And it will protect you from that hidden tax, inflation.
[00:22:27.785 --> 00:22:32.169]  If you've been thinking about investing in physical possession of precious metals, the time is now.
[00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:34.792]  Gold is at an all-time high and continues to move up.
[00:22:34.992 --> 00:22:35.452]  I can help.
[00:22:35.592 --> 00:22:36.233]  Call me today.
[00:22:36.313 --> 00:22:40.655]  Peter Kranschnabel at 800-686-2237 at extension 108.
[00:22:41.516 --> 00:22:46.558]  Now take the time to personally put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[00:22:46.638 --> 00:22:50.140]  Call 800-686-2237 extension 108.
[00:22:50.881 --> 00:22:53.782]  You've worked hard your whole life and I want to work hard for you.
[00:22:53.962 --> 00:22:55.243]  Call Peter Kranschnabel 800-686-2237 extension 108.
[00:22:59.693 --> 00:23:02.735]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:23:03.075 --> 00:23:06.678]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:23:06.978 --> 00:23:10.440]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:18.285]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants.
[00:23:18.285 --> 00:23:18.545]  I think so.
[00:23:33.479 --> 00:23:33.879]  That's right.
[00:24:07.125 --> 00:24:25.969]  About 45 minutes ago, Jaren told me he was watching a live press conference with Petraeus, Obama, and Vice President Biden, and that he saw Obama say, our democracy is strong because of institutions, not individuals.
[00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:33.231]  And we were not recording yet on TiVo, and you know how you can rewind on TiVo?
[00:24:34.111 --> 00:24:36.432]  Or whatever system that is out there, DVR.
[00:24:38.001 --> 00:24:44.526]  While the show's going, and then we had it, and I told him to play it and we lost it, but we'll have it by tomorrow regardless.
[00:24:44.546 --> 00:24:45.947]  It'll be all over YouTube and stuff.
[00:24:46.887 --> 00:24:47.688]  People will upload it.
[00:24:47.728 --> 00:24:52.411]  And he did say, our democracy is strong because of institutions, not individuals.
[00:24:53.132 --> 00:24:56.034]  I mean, that is the opposite of what this country was founded on.
[00:24:57.675 --> 00:25:03.579]  And it's just so incredible to see them openly teaching collectivism.
[00:25:05.114 --> 00:25:06.554]  Collectivism is bondage.
[00:25:06.614 --> 00:25:20.479]  Collectivism isn't being able to choose who you want to associate with, what you want to try to be in life, what you want to say, think, wear, eat, what you believe in, what you want to stand up for.
[00:25:20.539 --> 00:25:21.799]  It's just so amazing.
[00:25:23.422 --> 00:25:24.002]  I just wanted to tell you
[00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:52.730]  That I almost fell off my chair last night at the 10 o'clock news on Channel 4 in Dallas, Fox News.
[00:25:53.391 --> 00:26:03.103]  They were talking about the Dallas Police Department and he called it a paramilitary force, not police.
[00:26:04.013 --> 00:26:09.717]  No, no, they hide all this in plain view and they tell the police you're federalized, you're a paramilitary force.
[00:26:10.417 --> 00:26:14.340]  Their internal training is gun owners, veterans, conservatives are their number one enemy.
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:20.544]  I mean, look, the police and military on an individual basis are not traitors, are not bad.
[00:26:20.964 --> 00:26:23.486]  Some are, but on an individual basis you can't judge them.
[00:26:24.026 --> 00:26:30.151]  But the system and the orders they're given and the culture that they've been incrementally brought into
[00:26:31.131 --> 00:26:35.592]  Is 180 degrees in the opposite direction of our republic.
[00:26:35.692 --> 00:26:36.312]  It is treason.
[00:26:37.452 --> 00:26:41.873]  Yeah, I just didn't expect them to do it, like you said, in plain sight.
[00:26:41.973 --> 00:26:52.095]  Ma'am, I didn't expect the Pentagon to admit they're growing the opium in Afghanistan, or they put out fake Bin Laden videos, or that they lie and say they've killed Al-Qaeda leaders.
[00:26:52.755 --> 00:26:57.736]  I mean, again, they're really getting to the point of just throwing it in our face.
[00:27:00.606 --> 00:27:06.128]  Well, anyway, I just, like I said, I just couldn't believe it.
[00:27:07.549 --> 00:27:08.730]  Ma'am, I can't believe it either.
[00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:10.370]  God bless you and I appreciate your call.
[00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:19.134]  I mean, I couldn't believe it two weeks ago when I had the Fort Worth Star-Telegram with the police chief with the headline, Police Chief Promotes Hormone Replacement.
[00:27:19.874 --> 00:27:25.997]  And then he was talking about the police injecting anabolic steroids and testosterone and how great it is.
[00:27:27.403 --> 00:27:34.788]  I mean, again, I'm not the toughest guy in the world, but I'm red-blooded, and I've got my normal testosterone, and I've got to control myself.
[00:27:35.388 --> 00:27:37.070]  I've got to think, I'm a loving, nice person.
[00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.930]  I'm a good person.
[00:27:38.611 --> 00:27:40.132]  You know, I'm a sweet person.
[00:27:42.073 --> 00:27:46.196]  I mean, I'm the type of person, somebody gets in my face, I immediately want to physically attack them.
[00:27:46.676 --> 00:27:47.837]  That's how men have always been.
[00:27:47.857 --> 00:27:53.440]  I mean, no wonder cops are going crazy beating people up and going nuts all the time, injecting steroids.
[00:27:54.021 --> 00:27:56.582]  It's come out some departments, half of the men are on roids.
[00:27:56.962 --> 00:27:58.183]  Some of the women are taking it.
[00:27:58.643 --> 00:27:59.624]  What are you doing?
[00:28:02.594 --> 00:28:08.138]  I mean, I've read what anabolic steroids do, and it intensifies everything that testosterone already does naturally.
[00:28:08.539 --> 00:28:15.684]  Delusions of grandeur, excessive rage, aggression, lunacy, I mean, you know, war-likeness.
[00:28:16.244 --> 00:28:18.026]  I mean, of course we've got problems.
[00:28:18.046 --> 00:28:20.127]  They're hopping the cops up on steroids!
[00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:24.891]  Oh, man.
[00:28:26.612 --> 00:28:27.453]  I just don't understand it.
[00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:32.834]  I mean, I cannot imagine, from what I've read, taking steroids, folks.
[00:28:33.455 --> 00:28:33.915]  I cannot.
[00:28:33.975 --> 00:28:35.277]  I mean, I feel crazed right now.
[00:28:35.317 --> 00:28:36.758]  I feel completely aggressive right now.
[00:28:37.679 --> 00:28:42.244]  I mean, I feel like I could go out and get in a fight with, I could take on ten guys right now.
[00:28:42.864 --> 00:28:44.086]  That's how I feel every day.
[00:28:44.887 --> 00:28:46.729]  And the more I exercise, the worse it gets.
[00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:51.433]  That's why, when I diet and don't lift,
[00:28:52.401 --> 00:28:57.904]  See, I've been dieting, I've lost a lot of weight, I've been lifting, I've been running, I've been swimming, and I'm just, I'm just getting wild!
[00:28:58.564 --> 00:29:00.885]  That's because I'm boosting my regular testosterone.
[00:29:01.686 --> 00:29:07.569]  So you got a bunch of paramilitary people hopped up on drugs, running around, who've been taught the American people are their enemy.
[00:29:08.629 --> 00:29:11.271]  We've got this clip, let's go ahead and play it as we go out to break.
[00:29:12.671 --> 00:29:15.073]  Here is the clip of Obama.
[00:29:15.093 --> 00:29:21.236]  ...includes adherence to a strict code of conduct.
[00:29:22.779 --> 00:29:32.567]  The strength and greatness of our military is rooted in the fact that this code applies equally to newly enlisted privates and to the general officer who commands them.
[00:29:34.028 --> 00:29:35.929]  That allows us to come together as one.
[00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:42.154]  That is part of the reason why America has the finest fighting force in the history of the world.
[00:29:44.396 --> 00:29:50.521]  It is also true that our democracy depends upon institutions that are stronger than individuals.
[00:29:51.323 --> 00:29:52.609]  Empire's on the run!
[00:29:53.533 --> 00:29:56.225]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[00:29:59.045 --> 00:30:03.006]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:30:03.226 --> 00:30:09.269]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:30:09.629 --> 00:30:16.731]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:30:17.031 --> 00:30:21.593]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:30:51.833 --> 00:30:52.573]  Thank you.
[00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:04.281]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:31:04.621 --> 00:31:12.742]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:31:13.482 --> 00:31:17.523]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:31:18.103 --> 00:31:28.925]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:31:29.565 --> 00:31:38.569]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:44.132]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:31:44.512 --> 00:31:51.675]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:31:51.996 --> 00:31:54.757]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:31:58.527 --> 00:32:02.750]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:03.691]  Number one.
[00:32:03.991 --> 00:32:07.133]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:07.414 --> 00:32:07.994]  Number two.
[00:32:08.274 --> 00:32:12.818]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:13.178 --> 00:32:13.618]  It's true.
[00:32:13.918 --> 00:32:18.482]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:18.782 --> 00:32:19.342]  Number three.
[00:32:19.603 --> 00:32:22.885]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:23.205 --> 00:32:26.888]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:27.088 --> 00:32:27.648]  Number four.
[00:32:27.888 --> 00:32:30.249]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:30.649 --> 00:32:34.030]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:34.870]  Number five.
[00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:39.031]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:39.251 --> 00:32:44.033]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:44.313 --> 00:32:48.334]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:48.494 --> 00:32:50.035]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:50.275 --> 00:32:54.876]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:32:55.476 --> 00:32:55.716]  877-327-0365.
[00:32:56.417 --> 00:33:07.284]  Okay, I'm going to get back into what happened with McChrystal today, my take on it.
[00:33:07.344 --> 00:33:11.487]  Some of the bizarre things that Obama had to say at his press conference an hour ago.
[00:33:11.507 --> 00:33:12.688]  But before I go any further,
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:23.027]  I wanted to tell listeners that we have a lot of new great Patriot T-shirts that literally turn you into a walking, talking billboard for liberty.
[00:33:23.347 --> 00:33:29.252]  We have one that says, No Obamacare, with a don't tread on me snake around the symbol of medicine.
[00:33:30.253 --> 00:33:33.995]  And then we've got another T-shirt that I think is my favorite of the group.
[00:33:34.456 --> 00:33:36.658]  It says, Legalize Freedom.
[00:33:37.378 --> 00:33:42.640]  And it's got an American flag with the stars and bars, but the bars are made up by barbed wire.
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:45.081]  And it's a great way to start conversations with people.
[00:33:45.381 --> 00:33:47.682]  And it says, Legalize Freedom on the back.
[00:33:47.742 --> 00:33:51.283]  And your purchase of these t-shirts also funds our operation here.
[00:33:51.863 --> 00:33:55.744]  All available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:33:55.764 --> 00:33:56.404]  They're $19.95 apiece.
[00:33:56.444 --> 00:33:57.945]  Get two of the t-shirts.
[00:33:57.965 --> 00:33:59.626]  You can get them for $14.95 apiece.
[00:33:59.686 --> 00:34:02.867]  We've got some other specials where the t-shirts are as low as
[00:34:07.368 --> 00:34:11.372]  5.95 a piece, again, up on InfoWars.com.
[00:34:11.392 --> 00:34:16.598]  We even have a t-shirt deal where you get one t-shirt and get another free, or get one video, get a t-shirt free.
[00:34:16.898 --> 00:34:21.002]  Just check out all the specials at InfoWars.com, or when you call, ask about them.
[00:34:21.222 --> 00:34:26.107]  We have a new In the Fed, Save the Republic, InfoWars.com shirt that really stands out well.
[00:34:26.588 --> 00:34:27.368]  And then there's this one.
[00:34:28.294 --> 00:34:29.354]  That Phil designed.
[00:34:29.374 --> 00:34:30.515]  Phil actually designed all these.
[00:34:31.255 --> 00:34:32.415]  Legalize Freedom.
[00:34:32.435 --> 00:34:37.076]  And it's got Uncle Sam as a POW, MIA basically.
[00:34:38.576 --> 00:34:42.337]  It takes some from that design and says Legalize Freedom.
[00:34:42.637 --> 00:34:50.519]  When people ask about it, you can explain that America itself is becoming an occupied territory by the Obamanoid globalist.
[00:34:51.079 --> 00:35:17.779]  uh... and their neocon supporters on the back it says legalize freedom and we've got a whole bunch of other uh... great t-shirts and great t-shirt designs every person you wake up every person you talk to who ask you about uh... these shirts this is a way to get them to talk to you at tea parties or at church or at work or at the football game uh... or you know wherever it is you're out there or at the pub if you're listening in england or the bar here in the united states
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:24.002]  You can wear this into court, wear it into the county commissioners meeting, the city council, InfoWars.com.
[00:35:24.042 --> 00:35:29.865]  And of course we have all the films like Invisible Empire and New World Order Defined, Breaking Down the Globalist Takeover and How We Can Stop Them.
[00:35:30.365 --> 00:35:38.068]  Films like Rise of the Republic that is available, Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic, all at InfoWars.com.
[00:35:38.669 --> 00:35:46.512]  Okay, I want to get into the Iran situation and I've got mainstream news articles also here in my stack out of India.
[00:35:48.123 --> 00:36:12.541]  Where they're reporting that in major towns and cities, where they've been fluoridating the water under IMF World Bank funding, because the IMF World Bank cares so much about your teeth, they come in and will spend millions, even on a small town, lobbying just to get you to drink that, because the big central bankers, they want your pension funds, and they want your land, and they always fund eugenics organizations, and openly say there's too many of us, but they care about our teeth!
[00:36:13.837 --> 00:36:18.999]  And it just so happens it sterilizes, reduces fertility, and is causing massive bone cancer and deformities.
[00:36:19.299 --> 00:36:21.760]  And the Indian government's even admitting this now.
[00:36:23.361 --> 00:36:26.882]  I saw another group of EPA scientists coming out and saying it should be taken out of the water.
[00:36:27.402 --> 00:36:29.903]  So those are some other articles that I have.
[00:36:29.943 --> 00:36:31.884]  But again, there's no government conspiracy.
[00:36:31.984 --> 00:36:33.205]  Sure, it sterilizes.
[00:36:33.265 --> 00:36:34.465]  Sure, it causes bone cancer.
[00:36:34.885 --> 00:36:36.566]  But they're not doing it because they want to hurt you.
[00:36:37.597 --> 00:36:37.857]  No, no, no, no.
[00:36:37.877 --> 00:36:40.578]  They're doing it because they want to take good care of you.
[00:36:40.638 --> 00:36:52.521]  But getting serious, here is Obama, one of the little jewels from his speech, about how our institutions are what make American democracy great, not our individuals.
[00:36:52.861 --> 00:36:58.623]  Here is the clip that is 180 degrees the opposite of what our republic was founded on.
[00:37:00.123 --> 00:37:00.503]  As one.
[00:37:02.124 --> 00:37:06.685]  That is part of the reason why America has the finest fighting force in the history of the world.
[00:37:08.959 --> 00:37:15.088]  It is also true that our democracy depends upon institutions that are stronger than individuals.
[00:37:16.516 --> 00:37:23.300]  That includes strict adherence to the military chain of command, and respect for civilian control over that chain of command.
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:33.146]  And that's why, as Commander-in-Chief, I believe this decision is necessary to hold ourselves accountable to standards that are at the core of our democracy.
[00:37:33.206 --> 00:37:42.111]  And so, again, Hitler is the government in 1939 Germany, and you must do what the Fuhrer says, even if it violates the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:37:42.751 --> 00:37:43.792]  You must follow orders.
[00:37:43.832 --> 00:37:45.693]  Well, we know what happened at Nuremberg.
[00:37:45.713 --> 00:37:47.255]  But understand, we're not a democracy.
[00:37:47.295 --> 00:37:49.276]  We're a constitutional republic.
[00:37:49.316 --> 00:37:53.880]  And I know you, the listeners of this transmission, understand that.
[00:37:54.501 --> 00:37:57.483]  I know that you are fully aware of that.
[00:37:57.603 --> 00:37:59.024]  But your neighbors aren't.
[00:38:00.405 --> 00:38:02.287]  I mean, you could argue to explain to them.
[00:38:02.307 --> 00:38:03.748]  They'll say, well, we are a democracy.
[00:38:03.768 --> 00:38:08.312]  And go, well, our founders didn't call us a democratic republic.
[00:38:09.721 --> 00:38:11.802]  We're a constitutional republic.
[00:38:12.723 --> 00:38:21.288]  That means the people found a system to protect their liberty, their freedom, their property, and their right to live their life as they see fit, as long as they don't hurt others.
[00:38:22.309 --> 00:38:30.074]  And that if 51% votes to make the other 49% work as their slaves, it doesn't happen in a republic.
[00:38:30.554 --> 00:38:31.915]  In a democracy, it does.
[00:38:31.955 --> 00:38:34.677]  So that's why they always say democracy, democracy.
[00:38:34.797 --> 00:38:36.298]  And institutions
[00:38:38.533 --> 00:38:45.743]  Our country, he says, you know, as a democracy is able to function because institutions are bigger and more important than people.
[00:38:46.404 --> 00:38:50.971]  Well, yeah, in a democracy, in a slave system, that is the case.
[00:38:50.991 --> 00:38:52.273]  But this isn't even a democracy.
[00:38:54.614 --> 00:38:54.814]  Yeah.
[00:39:13.422 --> 00:39:20.829]  Has some validity, but there's the ugly German, the ugly Chinese, the ugly African, the ugly... Every country has its bad people.
[00:39:21.329 --> 00:39:23.771]  So yeah, there's the ugly American, there's the ugly Frenchman.
[00:39:24.652 --> 00:39:27.735]  But overall, there's a whole diversity to a country.
[00:39:30.595 --> 00:39:33.998]  The public doesn't want open borders over 80% in major polls.
[00:39:34.038 --> 00:39:38.482]  The public doesn't want carbon taxes over 80% in major polls.
[00:39:38.542 --> 00:39:42.886]  The public, 99% in Gallup polls, didn't want the bank or bailout, but it happened.
[00:39:43.106 --> 00:39:45.248]  So this isn't really even a democracy.
[00:39:45.828 --> 00:39:48.831]  They just tell you, you voted, this is what you want.
[00:39:49.031 --> 00:39:50.792]  But then they buy off the politicians.
[00:39:51.773 --> 00:39:58.615]  And only put people forward for high office who've already got so much dirt on them and are so compromised they can destroy them anytime they want.
[00:39:58.835 --> 00:40:03.717]  And to watch that Chicago mob boss with another mob boss, Biden, the total gangster.
[00:40:04.577 --> 00:40:09.959]  He's describing people of the Diplomatic Corps as a gangster, sitting there with that, Nah, I'm Don Caligoni.
[00:40:09.979 --> 00:40:12.820]  Oh, I tell you, Bossini's a pimp.
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:16.481]  It wasn't until today I knew... No, to tell you, he's a pimp.
[00:40:16.901 --> 00:40:19.822]  It wasn't until today I knew it was Bossini, though.
[00:40:20.816 --> 00:40:24.837]  When I die, you'll be invited to a meeting, and at that meeting, you'll be assassinated.
[00:40:25.598 --> 00:40:26.858]  These are quotes from the Godfather.
[00:40:27.518 --> 00:40:37.062]  I mean, to look at them going, you will follow the order of, put the mob bosses up there, of these guys, but they're only regional capos over North America.
[00:40:37.302 --> 00:40:39.562]  They work for the big Rothschild mafia above them.
[00:40:41.023 --> 00:40:42.804]  So that is just some of what we're going to be covering.
[00:40:42.844 --> 00:40:45.504]  Right now, let's go to Joanne in Ohio.
[00:40:45.524 --> 00:40:46.285]  You're on the air.
[00:40:46.305 --> 00:40:48.666]  Hi Alex, how are you today?
[00:40:48.906 --> 00:40:49.886]  I am doing alright.
[00:40:51.715 --> 00:41:19.734]  Well, I had got on your site, you know, because there's been growing talk of nuking this well, and I read on your site about, you know, the methane eruptions, the giant tsunamis, and, you know, a lot of the different problems that could come from that, but I got to look and there is a rather large fault line through New Orleans, and it wides off and heads westward through Texas.
[00:41:20.979 --> 00:41:23.000]  And then the other portion heads up to the Great Lakes.
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:23.940]  Well, that's right.
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:30.623]  I'm on the Balcones Fault Line, and there are scores of extinct volcanoes all around Austin, where I live.
[00:41:30.923 --> 00:41:33.864]  And that fault line goes out towards Louisiana and then out into the Gulf.
[00:41:34.604 --> 00:41:40.527]  And that's why the Mississippi, every 100 years or so, there's a big earthquake and it changes its course.
[00:41:40.607 --> 00:41:41.087]  It changes
[00:41:41.867 --> 00:42:05.100]  uh... you know basically where uh... where it's uh... traveling from the north to the south on some cases up to five miles uh... and uh... we have posted links to reports by geologists that are concerned about even nuke is detonated via slant drilling to try to uh... stop this uh... oil that's pouring out it may fracture the entire structure and may detonate the methane or other natural gas that's down there
[00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:13.284]  It could cause some type of chain reaction and a lot of people with letters behind their names say this is a potential problem, which may be part of the plan.
[00:42:13.304 --> 00:42:17.226]  I mean, they may have chosen this area, meaning to wind this up to that point.
[00:42:17.687 --> 00:42:18.307]  I mean, who knows?
[00:42:18.347 --> 00:42:19.868]  The sky's the limit with these globalists.
[00:42:19.888 --> 00:42:22.169]  They'll do anything to bring in their world government.
[00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:24.190]  Exactly.
[00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:29.113]  I had contacted a geologist, Mike Hanson, at the Ohio Seismic Network.
[00:42:29.933 --> 00:42:33.335]  And, you know, nukes were regularly tested underground.
[00:42:34.173 --> 00:42:35.433]  But never near fault lines.
[00:42:36.534 --> 00:42:39.375]  What a way to drive the American people into Camp FEMA.
[00:42:39.855 --> 00:42:40.695]  Well, who knows?
[00:42:41.315 --> 00:42:41.776]  Who knows?
[00:42:41.836 --> 00:42:46.417]  But when they do drive us into Camp FEMA, I mean, America already has more people in prison than any other nation.
[00:42:46.657 --> 00:42:51.199]  We already have our kids more brainwashed and trained to line up and be searched than any other country.
[00:42:51.219 --> 00:42:52.319]  We're already in Camp FEMA.
[00:42:52.339 --> 00:42:54.420]  But yes, they want to accelerate it.
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:59.161]  And I think people realize now this is the time of intensification of oppression.
[00:42:59.442 --> 00:43:00.502]  Joanne, good to hear from you.
[00:43:00.882 --> 00:43:02.983]  Scotty in Kentucky, you're on the air.
[00:43:04.363 --> 00:43:04.623]  Hello.
[00:43:05.083 --> 00:43:05.323]  Hello.
[00:43:05.344 --> 00:43:06.604]  How are you?
[00:43:06.804 --> 00:43:07.184]  I'm good.
[00:43:07.905 --> 00:43:08.205]  Okay.
[00:43:08.625 --> 00:43:14.608]  Alex, what I was wanting to touch upon here, the lady just kindly touched upon it, is the oil coming up in the Gulf.
[00:43:15.088 --> 00:43:17.830]  What about all the gases that can build up under the surface?
[00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:25.254]  Because we have, like, the killer lakes in Africa, which, ever so often, the gases turn up, and they killed, like, 1,700 people in 1986.
[00:43:25.294 --> 00:43:26.294]  I just wanted to touch up on that.
[00:43:30.902 --> 00:43:34.703]  Well, there's a lot of confusion going on because it is a complex world.
[00:43:35.283 --> 00:43:36.644]  And there's a lot of different factors.
[00:43:36.984 --> 00:43:38.384]  They drill for natural gas.
[00:43:38.484 --> 00:43:42.585]  They drill into these deposits all the time.
[00:43:43.546 --> 00:43:45.306]  And there are huge deposits in the Gulf.
[00:43:45.366 --> 00:43:47.787]  And when they find oil, they generally find natural gas.
[00:43:48.687 --> 00:43:55.354]  I would imagine they probably hit natural gas and oil at several other levels on their way down before they were going for the main zone they were after.
[00:43:55.374 --> 00:43:58.116]  I mean, that's standard operating procedure from what I've researched.
[00:43:58.997 --> 00:44:01.760]  People that work in oil fields can call and correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:44:05.623 --> 00:44:07.125]  They've already fractured the structure.
[00:44:07.165 --> 00:44:08.947]  It's already leaking up to 20 miles away.
[00:44:08.967 --> 00:44:18.617]  The issue is detonating a nuke down there, they believe will just fracture all of that even more and create more cracks up to the surface and could release even bigger.
[00:44:19.679 --> 00:44:32.493]  Multi-billion gallon reservoirs and if it hits some big reservoirs of natural gas, a nuke will probably cause a chain reaction in the gas and will probably break the structure up even more and cause more leaking.
[00:44:32.974 --> 00:44:38.440]  But don't worry, Obama and BP will have a new carbon tax that will handle that problem for you.
[00:44:39.502 --> 00:44:41.123]  Man, it just kills me to think about that.
[00:44:41.163 --> 00:44:41.863]  Well, they're mad.
[00:44:41.903 --> 00:44:42.804]  They're control freaks.
[00:44:42.864 --> 00:44:50.708]  I mean, they didn't get their Copenhagen Global Treaty to pay your tax money directly to Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase that run the IMF and World Bank.
[00:44:50.728 --> 00:44:53.510]  I mean, they're openly saying you're going to pay your taxes to them.
[00:44:53.990 --> 00:45:00.114]  And so, of course, Goldman Sachs runs BP, and they'll do whatever they have to to scare you into going along with the carbon tax.
[00:45:00.134 --> 00:45:04.776]  People are like, well, what does a tax on my house or on coal have to do with this?
[00:45:04.796 --> 00:45:07.458]  And Obama just says, you're going to find out, schmuck.
[00:45:09.005 --> 00:45:10.645]  I agree with that, that's for sure.
[00:45:10.805 --> 00:45:13.066]  I mean look, the sky's the limit.
[00:45:13.106 --> 00:45:13.726]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:45:14.867 --> 00:45:15.867]  I said I agree with that.
[00:45:15.887 --> 00:45:17.627]  It's a shame of what's going on.
[00:45:18.187 --> 00:45:20.568]  And I want to let you know you've got a lot of friends here in Kentucky.
[00:45:21.228 --> 00:45:22.549]  I know we have a lot of great folks.
[00:45:22.609 --> 00:45:23.889]  And look at Rand Paul winning.
[00:45:24.709 --> 00:45:30.391]  Look at this black Republican trouncing Strom Thurmond, who had a lot... Strom Thurmond Jr.
[00:45:30.431 --> 00:45:31.271]  had a lot more money.
[00:45:32.256 --> 00:45:38.501]  Then him, as a Republican in the primary, the Tea Party candidate, beat out Strom Thurmond's son.
[00:45:38.521 --> 00:45:48.348]  I mean, it just shows, no matter what party it is or what election now, all of the establishment candidates or incumbents are out on their butts.
[00:45:49.423 --> 00:45:55.768]  I tell you, I really think Ron Paul is going to win because he's got tremendous support here, but you will not hear it on the mainstream media.
[00:45:56.188 --> 00:45:58.109]  That's a total scam of what they're doing.
[00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:11.279]  And we've all seen the video, we've played it here, of he's on satellite, and Rachel Maddow, who's got a couple hundred thousand viewers, I mean the woman is a complete joke, I mean, they've got a fancy television production, that's it.
[00:46:11.339 --> 00:46:14.862]  It just hoaxes the people that watch it into thinking it's big.
[00:46:14.882 --> 00:46:16.183]  It's a joke!
[00:46:16.923 --> 00:46:24.629]  I mean, you know, a regional baseball game in Texas on AM radio has more listeners than that does, more viewers.
[00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:35.338]  And Matt Ow got him on, was talking over him, and he's talking, and she's talking, and she goes, what do you think of the Civil Rights Act?
[00:46:35.358 --> 00:46:36.619]  And he's like, OK, hold on.
[00:46:37.259 --> 00:46:37.960]  OK, yes.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:40.001]  And he goes, no, I support that.
[00:46:40.222 --> 00:46:40.922]  He goes, oh, OK.
[00:46:42.898 --> 00:46:44.459]  Yes, I can't.
[00:46:45.279 --> 00:46:47.180]  Oh, no, I support the Civil Rights Act.
[00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:51.701]  And they took him going, uh-huh, yes, mm-hmm, because she'd been talking over him.
[00:46:52.142 --> 00:46:55.643]  And then he stopped and shut up and said, yes, which is what anybody does.
[00:46:55.683 --> 00:46:56.683]  Yes, yes, say it again.
[00:46:57.184 --> 00:46:58.504]  Oh, proof, proof.
[00:46:58.964 --> 00:47:01.445]  He goes, no, I'm not against the Civil Rights Act.
[00:47:01.585 --> 00:47:02.266]  Yes, you are.
[00:47:02.286 --> 00:47:02.686]  Yes, you are.
[00:47:02.706 --> 00:47:03.686]  I mean, it was a hoax.
[00:47:03.806 --> 00:47:07.308]  Everything they do is about criminal hoaxes of deception.
[00:47:07.348 --> 00:47:08.128]  I appreciate your call.
[00:47:11.624 --> 00:47:13.465]  There's no end to these people.
[00:47:13.725 --> 00:47:15.566]  Let's talk to John in Washington.
[00:47:15.627 --> 00:47:16.587]  John, you're on the air.
[00:47:16.647 --> 00:47:17.007]  Welcome.
[00:47:17.968 --> 00:47:19.609]  Alex, real quick.
[00:47:20.169 --> 00:47:26.773]  During the hype for the McChrystal thing I heard on NPR, the Mineral Management Service now has a new name.
[00:47:26.793 --> 00:47:31.516]  It's going to be the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and Regulation Enforcement.
[00:47:32.917 --> 00:47:34.578]  They sort of snuck that in under wire.
[00:47:34.598 --> 00:47:37.040]  Did you hear about that?
[00:47:37.873 --> 00:47:38.433]  No, I didn't.
[00:47:38.994 --> 00:47:41.415]  You're saying, of course, what, they're creating a new federal agency?
[00:47:41.435 --> 00:47:48.180]  Yeah, well, they're going to turn the old one that was in charge of the Gulf fiasco into a new regulatory thing.
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:59.427]  And the other question I had for you is, do you think this McChrystal thing could be positioning Petraeus for a presidential run?
[00:48:00.839 --> 00:48:06.585]  Oh, that we know they're lining Petraeus up as the vice presidential candidate with Mr. Socialist Healthcare.
[00:48:07.126 --> 00:48:13.192]  So Republicans in the past would elect Mitt Romney now because they love to vote for socialists who have good hair.
[00:48:14.313 --> 00:48:19.999]  But now every incumbent, everyone seen as an establishment candidate is being shot down
[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:28.068]  And we have the Republican media saying, you better vote for mainline Republicans, you know, not for Tea Party people like Alex Jones.
[00:48:28.088 --> 00:48:29.430]  That's in the Washington Post today.
[00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:31.632]  That Alex Jones, don't be like him.
[00:48:31.652 --> 00:48:33.154]  Yeah, because then you'll stand out.
[00:48:33.514 --> 00:48:35.056]  Then the people will know you're real.
[00:48:35.357 --> 00:48:36.037]  Then you'll win.
[00:48:36.892 --> 00:48:49.586]  You've got the Republican establishment and the Democratic establishment, who are all intermarried and part of the criminal syndicate, trying to keep control of both of their parties and keep them on the big government reservation, and they're going to fail.
[00:48:50.107 --> 00:48:56.493]  And, I mean, all of this, all I know is McChrystal doing what he did, he knew it was going to come out.
[00:48:57.708 --> 00:49:00.931]  And yes, they are positioning Petraeus.
[00:49:01.732 --> 00:49:03.593]  But again, Petraeus having a seizure.
[00:49:03.974 --> 00:49:12.702]  You better believe that when he starts running for president, nothing against people that have seizures, but the media is going to have a field day with that, saying you can't have a commander-in-chief that collapses.
[00:49:12.742 --> 00:49:14.604]  And he clearly had a seizure.
[00:49:15.064 --> 00:49:16.746]  I think that's a big strike against Petraeus.
[00:49:17.026 --> 00:49:17.746]  You know, the leader
[00:49:18.467 --> 00:49:22.253]  Has gotta, you know, look like he's healthy and tough and virile.
[00:49:22.714 --> 00:49:25.739]  I mean, that's just like with Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
[00:49:25.779 --> 00:49:27.382]  They hid the fact he was in a wheelchair.
[00:49:28.063 --> 00:49:30.347]  The American people didn't even know he was in a wheelchair.
[00:49:30.387 --> 00:49:31.869]  That's how bamboozled they were.
[00:49:33.154 --> 00:49:35.416]  I mean, I'm not saying it's bad to be in a wheelchair.
[00:49:35.676 --> 00:49:38.337]  What matters is what somebody thinks and believes and stands for.
[00:49:38.658 --> 00:49:49.765]  But the issue is, in this petty world, where all that matters is the color of your hair and how stylish it is and, you know, do you look like a ladies' man, that this is a big strike against Betray Us.
[00:49:51.326 --> 00:49:52.247]  And can I say one thing, Alex?
[00:49:52.607 --> 00:49:52.847]  Yes, sir.
[00:49:54.739 --> 00:49:58.422]  I am starting a Facebook thing, Anti-War Tacoma.
[00:49:58.482 --> 00:50:03.385]  I'm going to try to protest our Congressman Norm Dix when they start to move forward with the strike.
[00:50:03.425 --> 00:50:05.446]  So if anyone out here is listening in Tacoma,
[00:50:06.292 --> 00:50:09.813]  Contact me on Facebook and let's raise our voices.
[00:50:10.153 --> 00:50:10.713]  All right, buddy.
[00:50:10.753 --> 00:50:11.433]  Good job there.
[00:50:11.493 --> 00:50:12.693]  Everybody needs to get organized.
[00:50:12.753 --> 00:50:15.894]  I mean, it doesn't matter if it's five of you out there protesting the Iran strike.
[00:50:16.774 --> 00:50:20.115]  It doesn't matter if it's, you know, three of you out there against water fluoridation.
[00:50:20.415 --> 00:50:21.755]  That's how big things start.
[00:50:21.815 --> 00:50:25.436]  We know if we just sit here on our hands, we're not going to have an effect.
[00:50:25.456 --> 00:50:32.097]  I mean, I never intended 16 years ago, it was about really 17 when I started getting politically active,
[00:50:33.231 --> 00:50:36.593]  I never intended, been on air 15 years, to be where I am now.
[00:50:36.673 --> 00:50:38.034]  I could have never imagined it.
[00:50:41.415 --> 00:50:45.898]  I would have tried to grow earlier or faster, but you can't go back.
[00:50:45.978 --> 00:50:47.398]  Hindsight's 20-20 as they say.
[00:50:48.079 --> 00:50:51.540]  Believe me, the journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.
[00:50:51.881 --> 00:50:53.021]  Take that first step.
[00:50:53.081 --> 00:50:54.022]  Take that second step.
[00:50:54.282 --> 00:50:55.883]  Take that third, that fourth, that fifth.
[00:50:56.063 --> 00:50:58.024]  It's not about the destination, it's about the journey.
[00:50:59.707 --> 00:51:02.629]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[00:51:02.709 --> 00:51:04.670]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:07.432]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[00:51:07.532 --> 00:51:09.473]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[00:51:09.753 --> 00:51:10.954]  Okay, here it comes.

[00:51:13.076 --> 00:51:14.797]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[00:51:14.997 --> 00:51:16.718]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[00:51:16.978 --> 00:51:20.480]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.

[00:51:49.978 --> 00:51:50.258]  It works!
[00:51:59.366 --> 00:52:01.687]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:01.747 --> 00:52:03.968]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:04.068 --> 00:52:06.889]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:07.289 --> 00:52:12.030]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:12.391 --> 00:52:16.572]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:16.892 --> 00:52:19.234]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:19.254 --> 00:52:21.775]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:21.795 --> 00:52:24.697]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:25.037 --> 00:52:32.642]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:32.982 --> 00:52:38.225]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:38.245 --> 00:52:41.166]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:41.226 --> 00:52:44.648]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:44.908 --> 00:52:45.829]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:45.989 --> 00:52:47.289]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:47.329 --> 00:52:48.350]  Invisible Empire.

[00:52:59.355 --> 00:53:02.537]  So you think the massive Gulf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe?
[00:53:03.097 --> 00:53:03.589]  Think again.
[00:53:04.409 --> 00:53:11.892]  Benzene, a toxic gas emitted from crude oil and a known carcinogen, is now airborne traveling hundreds, even thousands of miles inland.
[00:53:12.052 --> 00:53:19.035]  Whether you live near the Gulf or not, benzene and other volatile organic compounds could cause adverse reactions to those living inside your home.
[00:53:19.295 --> 00:53:27.519]  NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, came to airfiltersandpurifiers.com for answers on how to clean the air on boats aiding in the Gulf cleanup.

[00:54:10.256 --> 00:54:19.958]  In the first five minutes of the next hour, I'm going to cover some medical tyranny news, and Dr. John Coleman's going to finish up the interview he did with us about a week and a half ago.
[00:54:19.978 --> 00:54:21.419]  I want to do part two of him live here.
[00:54:21.439 --> 00:54:24.739]  And we'll have some calls then as well.
[00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:35.262]  On the Iran front, we're seeing really a replay of all the past propaganda.
[00:54:35.842 --> 00:54:36.982]  Looking for my stack here.
[00:54:37.022 --> 00:54:39.803]  I could swear I just had that thing.
[00:54:41.283 --> 00:54:41.924]  In front of me.
[00:54:42.304 --> 00:54:42.985]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[00:54:43.025 --> 00:54:44.607]  You know the news headlines.
[00:54:44.648 --> 00:54:47.451]  The head of Mossad has said they need to strike Iran.
[00:54:47.471 --> 00:54:53.239]  The United Nations is announcing that they intend to vote for sanctions to board all Iranian ships.
[00:54:53.659 --> 00:54:56.663]  The Iranians say they'll start boarding other ships in the Gulf.
[00:54:57.464 --> 00:54:58.665]  It's all acts of war.
[00:54:59.445 --> 00:55:04.247]  The media is now saying they've got super missiles that can hit the United States.
[00:55:04.968 --> 00:55:15.053]  It's all an exact replay of the lies about WMDs seven years ago in the lead up to the attack on Iraq after a decade plus of crippling sanctions.
[00:55:16.233 --> 00:55:17.254]  And it's all about empire.
[00:55:20.802 --> 00:55:26.325]  I'll tell you what Alex, getting through to you is about as hard as fighting a politician with a conscience and a moral standard somewhere.
[00:55:26.345 --> 00:55:26.905]  This is unreal.
[00:55:46.508 --> 00:55:57.456]  I listened to your show about 13, 14 years ago, and I'll admit back then I thought you were whacked out, but I'm waking up today and everything's going on around me, and it is total and complete tyranny.
[00:55:57.836 --> 00:56:01.339]  And like you said before, it's a total repeat of history.
[00:56:01.719 --> 00:56:06.462]  When we left England and came to America, we left because we were slaves.
[00:56:06.522 --> 00:56:07.103]  We were serfs.
[00:56:07.143 --> 00:56:09.224]  We were slaves to the nth degree.
[00:56:10.765 --> 00:56:13.446]  They were taxing the air we were breathing.
[00:56:13.506 --> 00:56:16.508]  If you stop and think about it, that's what this CO2 thing is, too.
[00:56:16.528 --> 00:56:18.669]  They're gonna start taxing us for the air we're breathing.
[00:56:19.049 --> 00:56:26.072]  I remember people a decade ago... I remember the movie Spaceballs, a comedy, where they're taxing the air.
[00:56:26.472 --> 00:56:28.053]  And now that's what this is.
[00:56:30.383 --> 00:56:30.883]  Exactly!
[00:56:30.963 --> 00:56:39.130]  And Obama was quoted yesterday, I heard on another radio show, where he said there's an opposition raising to abolish Obamacare.
[00:56:39.150 --> 00:56:40.351]  He said, I'm not going back.
[00:56:40.771 --> 00:56:45.194]  My question is, Mr. Sotaro, what are you afraid of going back to?
[00:56:45.575 --> 00:56:46.596]  The Constitution?
[00:56:47.356 --> 00:56:48.137]  We the people?
[00:56:48.837 --> 00:56:53.902]  Or are you afraid of going back to capitalism?
[00:56:54.302 --> 00:56:59.947]  What do you think of Obama saying America is about institutions not individuals?
[00:57:01.036 --> 00:57:09.658]  I think he's just a total dictator and there was a report earlier today too that they're talking about an executive order to get the amnesty.
[00:57:09.678 --> 00:57:11.499]  He's already hijacked Arizona.
[00:57:11.819 --> 00:57:22.442]  Oh yeah, he signed an executive order federalizing what food you can eat and how much salt can be in food and now they're going to try to implement where the federal government controls everything.
[00:57:24.184 --> 00:57:39.514]  I'll tell you, Alex, if we don't find a way, whether at the state or federal level, to indict these people, the Soroses, the CFR, the Federal Reserve, if we don't find a way to expose this in the mainstream and prosecute these people,
[00:57:40.094 --> 00:57:44.955]  Then, unfortunately, someday we're going to wake up and realize it's time for another civil war.
[00:57:45.235 --> 00:57:55.758]  Well, Matt, I hear you, and they want to push us into a physical civil war because they think they might be able to win that, or finagle that, or use that as an excuse to shut down free speech.
[00:57:56.558 --> 00:58:08.441]  The reason they're coming in wanting to restrict the Internet openly, and, you know, the best way to expose a dictator is make them act like one, the best way to bring them down is to make them act like one, like Mike Rivera always says, and that's true.
[00:58:10.641 --> 00:58:17.065]  By them coming out and saying they want to take the web over, it shows how what we're saying and doing is hurting them.
[00:58:17.505 --> 00:58:18.826]  I mean, listen to MSNBC.
[00:58:18.886 --> 00:58:20.207]  All they talk about is the Tea Party.
[00:58:20.267 --> 00:58:24.930]  All they talk about is me and how I'm a criminal and how I'm calling for violence, which isn't true.
[00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:27.011]  They're trying to lie to police so they come after me.
[00:58:27.591 --> 00:58:28.392]  They're desperate.
[00:58:28.452 --> 00:58:29.372]  We're hurting them.
[00:58:29.732 --> 00:58:30.813]  They're not invincible.
[00:58:31.133 --> 00:58:32.074]  In fact, they're weak.
[00:58:32.334 --> 00:58:37.277]  They're a bunch of pot-bellied scum who are criminal trash and we're gonna defeat them.
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:43.327]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:43.869 --> 00:58:47.040]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:53.126 --> 00:58:54.027]  Tyranny is here.
[00:58:54.407 --> 00:58:57.970]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:58:58.250 --> 00:59:00.552]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:59:00.732 --> 00:59:06.016]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:59:06.436 --> 00:59:12.661]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:59:13.081 --> 00:59:18.625]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:59:19.045 --> 00:59:22.707]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[00:59:23.248 --> 00:59:27.230]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:33.094]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:59:33.474 --> 00:59:36.476]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:59:37.036 --> 00:59:38.477]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:59:39.017 --> 00:59:39.458]  It's here.

[00:59:52.068 --> 00:59:54.009]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:54.450 --> 00:59:57.252]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:17.015 --> 01:00:22.256]  All right, my friends, I want to get into some medical tyranny news in this first five minutes.
[01:00:22.416 --> 01:00:30.718]  Then we've got a guest joining us, coming up in the next segment on some very important issues.
[01:00:31.258 --> 01:00:34.579]  We are into the fourth and final hour on this Wednesday, 23rd day of June 2010.
[01:00:39.568 --> 01:00:49.873]  Indian children blinded, crippled by fluoride and water and growing awareness of mass medication of public with deadly neurotoxin leads to establishment backlash.
[01:00:50.294 --> 01:01:07.423]  This is a key article by Paul Joseph Watson up on PrisonPlanet.com and in it he quotes the Times of India, the biggest paper and most prestigious, and he also quotes top FDA scientists, over ninety percent of them have sent
[01:01:08.422 --> 01:01:12.424]  Repeated open letters, we've had them on, we're going to get them back on, saying take it out.
[01:01:12.924 --> 01:01:20.006]  And they're also freaked out by the federal government launching counter-strikes with TV and radio ads, making fun of people that think it's bad.
[01:01:20.407 --> 01:01:29.130]  It is 100% fact that sodium fluoride, in the levels they put it in the water, is a cumulative poison that attacks fertility, causes cancer, bone cancer, you name it.
[01:01:30.157 --> 01:01:42.084]  And now even top government neuro-physicians, toxicologists, they're all quoted in the Indian government, are saying, yeah, we're giving IMF World Bank loans to put this in the money.
[01:01:42.844 --> 01:01:45.685]  I mean, we're giving this money to put this in the water.
[01:01:46.926 --> 01:01:51.829]  And this is causing massive deformities, massive retardation.
[01:01:51.849 --> 01:01:55.091]  They quote, disabilities and deformities.
[01:01:56.697 --> 01:02:03.440]  Due to the excess fluoride content in the drinking water, the calcium intake is not absorbed in the body, causing disabilities and deformities.
[01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:09.322]  And it just quotes all these scientists, the report in the Express of India, the Times of India.
[01:02:09.742 --> 01:02:14.464]  I mean, this is big, big, big news in India.
[01:02:14.744 --> 01:02:16.685]  But they're being paid all this money to do this.
[01:02:18.817 --> 01:02:19.477]  Here's another one.
[01:02:19.517 --> 01:02:23.800]  Debate about addition of sodium fluoride to Mount Pleasant water continues.
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:30.564]  And it says in the article that the city has voted to cut it from one part per million to 0.4 parts per million.
[01:02:32.711 --> 01:02:39.593]  Which still reduces IQ in all the studies and causes brain damage, but at least they're trying to do it there.
[01:02:40.713 --> 01:02:46.774]  And boy, when you try to get fluoride out, suddenly lobbyists come out, feds show up, billboards, TV ads.
[01:02:46.834 --> 01:02:52.635]  I mean, they really care about your teeth and sterilizing you and making you mentally retarded or reducing your IQ.
[01:02:52.695 --> 01:02:54.836]  I mean, you're given a chemical IQ reduction.
[01:02:55.736 --> 01:02:57.817]  I mean, the average person can, I guess, only
[01:03:00.743 --> 01:03:05.368]  I guess enjoy sports, because they're literally, they've been hurt badly.
[01:03:05.408 --> 01:03:07.010]  I mean, these are zombies.
[01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:13.256]  Political mischaracterization of fluoride, opposition, dismay, scientist, PR news wire.
[01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:15.679]  We're going to get these people back on, these scientists.
[01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:27.236]  Oberman slams Tea Party Senate candidate for voting against water fluoridation, makes a joke and says that she says it's poison when on the bag they have a skull and crossbones.
[01:03:27.936 --> 01:03:40.864]  Scientists representing the Fluoride Action Network strongly object to recent mischaracterizations of fluoridation opponents by political pundits Rachel Maddow, Keith Oberman and others in conjunction with Senator Harry Reid's Nevada re-election campaign.
[01:03:41.345 --> 01:03:45.668]  Fluoridation opposition is science-based and growing, says Paul Conant, Ph.D.
[01:03:47.622 --> 01:04:12.873]  Fluoride Action Network Executive Director, we've had him on, who's testified before Congress, who has co-authored the upcoming book, The Case Against Fluoride, How Hazardous Waste Ended Up in the Drinking Water, and Bad Science and Powerful Politics has kept it there, co-authors James Beek, M.D., medical doctor, Ph.D., professor emeritus, the medical physics in University of Alberta, Calgary, I want him on, and Speeding McEllum,
[01:04:14.466 --> 01:04:17.049]  Professor Emeritus, Edinburgh University.
[01:04:17.449 --> 01:04:22.555]  We have spent years investigating water fluoridation, the toxicity of fluoride, and we are dismayed that...
[01:04:26.837 --> 01:04:36.823]  That the television commentators are willing to repeat, without verification, pro-fluoridation statements that disparage scientists and citizens who oppose the practice, says Conant.
[01:04:37.323 --> 01:04:39.964]  And then it just goes in through... I mean, folks, you don't have to believe me.
[01:04:39.984 --> 01:04:44.347]  You just search the term, water fluoridation doubles bone cancer.
[01:04:44.687 --> 01:04:48.969]  Japanese, Chinese, Russian, British, U.S., University of Texas.
[01:04:49.890 --> 01:04:51.271]  And it's even worse for boys.
[01:04:51.351 --> 01:04:52.471]  I mean, that's just one study.
[01:04:53.872 --> 01:04:55.814]  Water fluoridation reduces IQ.
[01:04:55.914 --> 01:04:57.075]  It's all conclusive!
[01:04:57.095 --> 01:04:57.996]  You're being murdered!
[01:04:58.296 --> 01:04:58.777]  Okay?
[01:04:59.597 --> 01:05:02.200]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:07.584]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:05:07.945 --> 01:05:09.666]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:05:09.987 --> 01:05:14.811]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:05:14.991 --> 01:05:15.952]  How much do you want?
[01:05:16.172 --> 01:05:16.893]  When do you want it?
[01:05:17.273 --> 01:05:18.874]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:05:19.154 --> 01:05:19.975]  When will you need it?
[01:05:20.235 --> 01:05:22.297]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:05:22.437 --> 01:05:23.538]  Will there be any food?
[01:05:23.778 --> 01:05:25.119]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:05:25.299 --> 01:05:30.362]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:05:30.563 --> 01:05:33.705]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:05:34.145 --> 01:05:37.648]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:05:37.968 --> 01:05:38.949]  How much will you need?
[01:05:39.189 --> 01:05:39.810]  We don't know.
[01:05:40.090 --> 01:05:41.011]  How much do you want?
[01:05:41.211 --> 01:05:41.931]  All you can get.
[01:05:42.131 --> 01:05:42.972]  I'm Alex Jones.

[01:07:59.635 --> 01:08:04.700]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:07.342]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:09.622 --> 01:08:12.168]  All right, 52 minutes left in transmission.
[01:08:12.188 --> 01:08:15.074]  He was under the weather last week, so we just had him on for one segment.
[01:08:15.094 --> 01:08:17.158]  He's with us for the balance of this hour.
[01:08:18.393 --> 01:08:32.358]  He's Dr. John Coleman, an author, of course, constitutional lawyer, and he is with us today because he's written some very interesting books on the Tavistock Institute on Human Relations.
[01:08:32.738 --> 01:08:42.081]  From my research, you talk about trailblazers and mind control, propaganda, brainwashing, with Edward Bernays and others right up at that level.
[01:08:43.058 --> 01:08:44.379]  It's the Tavistock Institute.
[01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:52.027]  Also, drug war against America, about how the big banks and CIA are shipping in a lot of the narcotics to destabilize the country.
[01:08:52.428 --> 01:08:53.629]  Now they just admit that.
[01:08:53.669 --> 01:08:54.650]  He wrote this years ago.
[01:08:54.970 --> 01:08:57.914]  They come right out on Fox and CNN and say, yeah, we grow the opium.
[01:08:57.934 --> 01:09:00.857]  Because if we don't, Al-Qaeda will get it and make money.
[01:09:02.230 --> 01:09:13.876]  And of course he wrote the Committee of 300, getting into kind of the Anglo-American black nobility of Italy as well, that structure of behind-the-scenes imperial corporate government.
[01:09:14.536 --> 01:09:17.417]  And a lot of the work I see on Bilderberg that others have written about is...
[01:09:19.378 --> 01:09:27.920]  Uh, mirrored, uh, previously by, uh, our guest, uh, Dr. John Coleman's, uh, research, so he is, he is with us.
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:34.381]  I know we have loaded phone lines, and I'll try to get to some of your calls towards the end, or we may not, actually, because I don't know if we have time.
[01:09:34.701 --> 01:09:39.662]  In fact, unfortunately, if those callers just call back tomorrow, uh, I'll be able to put them to the head of the line.
[01:09:39.703 --> 01:09:42.063]  I apologize to, uh, everybody else that's holding.
[01:09:42.083 --> 01:09:46.144]  I'm, I'm looking at the clock, and I just don't think we'll have time, uh, but, uh,
[01:09:47.264 --> 01:09:51.887]  We'll be taking your calls again, as I said, tomorrow, so I apologize to those.
[01:09:52.428 --> 01:09:54.209]  But this information is all so important.
[01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:58.832]  But first, just some quick answers from his perspective, with Dr. John Coleman.
[01:09:59.773 --> 01:10:05.457]  John, specifically, from all I see, there's a quickening happening, an acceleration.
[01:10:06.077 --> 01:10:08.079]  The controllers are moving on every front.
[01:10:08.439 --> 01:10:11.021]  If you say you had five minutes on national television,
[01:10:11.701 --> 01:10:16.024]  I think that the best way to look at this is to take it from the point of view of country by country.
[01:10:16.044 --> 01:10:22.289]  The United States, we know, is in the hands of socialism, which has always been there ever since the days of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
[01:10:39.762 --> 01:10:43.605]  They used many contrived situations to get this as far as they have.
[01:10:44.145 --> 01:11:00.436]  For instance, the sinking of the Lusitania to get America into World War I, and the other contrived situation, the Gulf of Tonkin to get us into World War II, and the turning over of China to the Communists, ousting Japan from the mainland.
[01:11:01.417 --> 01:11:05.580]  All these things, and now the United States would definitely have a social stigma.
[01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:07.081]  I don't think anybody would doubt that.
[01:11:07.839 --> 01:11:14.924]  Anybody who's done any study as to what socialism actually means, I think they all agree that we're in the grip of socialism in America.
[01:11:15.665 --> 01:11:30.095]  And this, of course, means that it's all working in tandem towards the one world government inside a new world order, which I've written about extensively in all of my books, particularly the Tavistock Institute and the Committee of 300.
[01:11:30.975 --> 01:11:32.917]  But not only those books, other books as well.
[01:11:35.046 --> 01:11:44.089]  Well, the Globalist, mainly centering in and around Britain, from my research, and I cover this in my film Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, what is the endgame.com?
[01:11:44.109 --> 01:11:54.453]  It's the website as an online bibliography for the film, like a book, and also an index for the film, so people can see the proof that's in the film for themselves.
[01:11:55.573 --> 01:11:58.374]  It's an open conspiracy, the title of HG Wells' book.
[01:11:58.894 --> 01:12:10.078]  A world socialist government destroying the family, scientifically having the state basically remove children like you remove the eggs from a hen, to use an Orwell quote.
[01:12:10.358 --> 01:12:11.959]  Of course, he was part of British intelligence.
[01:12:12.619 --> 01:12:15.340]  All of that going on, and that they would slowly
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:22.125]  Get control of society, and now we've gone through that hundred-year period, and now they're going into their endgame.
[01:12:22.826 --> 01:12:25.288]  Giant wars to exterminate us, you name it.
[01:12:25.869 --> 01:12:35.518]  And, you know, you read Aldous Huxley, you read Bertrand Russell, you read the Wedgwoods, all these people are public, they all write government textbooks.
[01:12:36.078 --> 01:12:40.362]  I've got John P. Holdren's textbook, The White House Science Czar, he says a planetary regime.
[01:12:41.303 --> 01:12:43.885]  We're going to put chemicals in the water to sterilize you?
[01:12:44.225 --> 01:12:59.697]  I mean, this is really an open conspiracy, but they know the general public is not reading what these elites have said and done, so I think, speak to that, and then the Tavistock Institute, your research into it being a key node in the actual command and control system.
[01:13:00.457 --> 01:13:06.142]  But of course, and you know, one of the people I mentioned in my book, Tavistock Institute, is Edward Bernays.
[01:13:06.662 --> 01:13:09.044]  He was a nephew of Freud, the, uh,
[01:13:09.850 --> 01:13:32.114]  Gentlemen who led the so-called scientific scrambling of the brains, and then you have the country turned over to social engineering and social scientists, all in the one big, if they like, cogs in this giant big machine, propelling us against our will, if we stop to realize it, towards a new world order as fast as they can go.
[01:13:32.134 --> 01:13:39.515]  And you take all the wars that have ever been fought, what has been the origin, economic or was there?
[01:13:40.063 --> 01:13:40.344]  I think so.
[01:13:55.831 --> 01:13:56.532]  Well, continue.
[01:13:56.612 --> 01:13:59.614]  Flesh out the research you did into the Tavistock Institute.
[01:13:59.634 --> 01:14:02.096]  Tell people about it, what the organization does.
[01:14:02.116 --> 01:14:05.319]  I mean, I've actually visited the Tavistock Institute.
[01:14:05.339 --> 01:14:16.569]  I didn't go in it, but I noticed that the London bus bombing on 7-7 blew up right in front of the Tavistock Institute, so I went there days after the bombing and talked to eyewitnesses from my film Terror Storm.
[01:14:17.890 --> 01:14:21.253]  Well, the Tavistock Institute was unknown to the people of the United States.
[01:14:22.057 --> 01:14:34.166]  And I don't like to toot my own horn, but I think the existence was first exposed in my 1969 monograph, The Tavistock Institute of Humanization, Britain's Control of the United States.
[01:14:35.047 --> 01:14:47.517]  I think up to that time, Tavistock had very successfully retained its secretive role in shaping the affairs of the United States, its government, its people, since its very early beginning in London in 1913.
[01:14:47.617 --> 01:14:51.620]  And they set up shop at a place called Wellington House,
[01:14:52.626 --> 01:15:02.953]  That originally was set up in order to coerce the British public into the First World War and then the American public that had no wish to be in this war whatsoever.
[01:15:03.794 --> 01:15:17.504]  And the project was given by the British government to the Holmesworth brothers, Lord Rothermere and Lord Northbrook, and their mandate was to produce an organization capable of manipulating public opinion
[01:15:18.186 --> 01:15:26.753]  And directing that manufactured opinion down the desired pathway to support a declaration of war by Great Britain against Germany.
[01:15:26.773 --> 01:15:36.540]  Funding was provided by the British Royal Family, and later by the Rothschilds, to whom Lord Northup was related through marriage.
[01:15:37.301 --> 01:15:44.326]  Arnold Toynbee was later selected as Director of Future Studies at the Royal Institute of International Affairs.
[01:15:45.307 --> 01:15:46.948]  Two Americans, Walter Lippmann,
[01:15:47.685 --> 01:16:06.133]  And Edward Bernays were appointed to handle the liquidation of Britain and the British and the American public opinion in preparation for entry of the United States into World War I. And to brief and direct President Woodrow Wilson while toying the consequence on changing British public opinion.
[01:16:07.514 --> 01:16:11.495]  And you know, everything boils down to what the public perception of something is.
[01:16:12.176 --> 01:16:14.257]  And if you have a population that's 80%
[01:16:15.623 --> 01:16:23.730]  Opposed to your objective, being the government, then the clear spot has to be won by changing that public opinion to that which you wanted.
[01:16:24.311 --> 01:16:38.543]  And that's why they set up this very scientific organisation, and then they had a big upset in 1930, because the two brothers, Northcliffe and Armstrong, didn't see eye to eye.
[01:16:39.484 --> 01:16:40.585]  And Lord Ruffner,
[01:16:41.519 --> 01:16:47.284]  broke away from the Wellington House and in World War II actually became an ardent supporter of Adolf Hitler.
[01:16:48.185 --> 01:16:50.386]  And he vehemently opposed the war with Germany.
[01:16:50.407 --> 01:16:59.094]  And after one such war to Hitler, Lord Bruckner returned to London and denounced those clamoring for war with Hitler as supporters of the Bolsheviks.
[01:16:59.734 --> 01:17:06.480]  Which just goes to show how easily, really, public opinion can be swayed and molded and formed.
[01:17:07.861 --> 01:17:09.843]  And the Hanzo brothers then
[01:17:10.751 --> 01:17:20.339]  Came into a lot of money, and they began publishing a weekly newspaper called Answers to Correspondence, in which questions were sent in and were answered.
[01:17:22.001 --> 01:17:32.390]  By 1994, the brothers were able to produce and purchase the Evening News, which began copying American format.
[01:17:33.511 --> 01:17:36.774]  As a result of that, the Daily Mail was first published in London,
[01:17:37.679 --> 01:17:39.780]  Well isn't there maxim or credo that perception is reality?
[01:17:58.735 --> 01:17:59.576]  That's what they say.
[01:18:00.196 --> 01:18:01.398]  That's exactly what they say.
[01:18:01.898 --> 01:18:08.745]  But they have to have these enormous mind-bending, mind-control organizations to change the public perception.
[01:18:08.765 --> 01:18:14.570]  It's no good having the reality of people totally opposed to a war unless you can change that.
[01:18:15.531 --> 01:18:17.033]  That's your first battle in any war.
[01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:22.363]  And we were lied to eight years ago about Iraq.
[01:18:22.423 --> 01:18:27.288]  They're repeating the exact same propaganda about secret missiles, secret nukes.
[01:18:27.929 --> 01:18:32.273]  Al-Qaeda is in Iran, even though Iran is Shiite, even though the U.S.
[01:18:32.313 --> 01:18:35.497]  government has four Al-Qaeda groups publicly attacking Iran.
[01:18:35.957 --> 01:18:37.338]  Iran sits there and takes it.
[01:18:37.899 --> 01:18:41.282]  And they use the exact same propaganda again on the sheeple.
[01:18:42.063 --> 01:18:50.690]  Uh, and then they had that propaganda about a trillion dollars in lithium last week, when that's old news, as if the American people are going to get a trillion dollars.
[01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:53.492]  Even if that was there, we're going to pay to go steal it.
[01:18:53.972 --> 01:18:54.813]  We're going to pay for it.
[01:18:54.853 --> 01:18:55.774]  We're not going to get it.
[01:18:56.954 --> 01:18:57.395]  Exactly.
[01:18:58.215 --> 01:18:58.596]  Exactly.
[01:18:58.636 --> 01:19:00.077]  I couldn't have put it better myself.
[01:19:00.857 --> 01:19:07.763]  Anyway, these organizations were set up, and they brought up a new language altogether, like regime change and collateral damage.
[01:19:08.443 --> 01:19:10.625]  It became almost a new English language all
[01:19:11.164 --> 01:19:13.227]  Better yet, the Tavistock English Language.
[01:19:14.688 --> 01:19:28.105]  And with this, they modified to suit the American conditions, and President Wilson set up the very first Tavistock methodology technique for polling that's manufactured in so-called public opinion.
[01:19:36.344 --> 01:19:42.629]  Let's talk about the scientific dictatorship and these secret managers when we get back, because now they're not even secret.
[01:19:42.649 --> 01:19:52.578]  I mean, we get the SPP, North American Union documents, and it's a scientific board, or the corporate board, telling the government what to do, and the government clicks its heels and says, yes sir.
[01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:00.420]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:20:00.601 --> 01:20:05.943]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[01:20:06.144 --> 01:20:06.544]  I get it.
[01:20:06.684 --> 01:20:16.029]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:20:16.309 --> 01:20:17.490]  That's not what's happening.
[01:20:17.710 --> 01:20:23.933]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value.
[01:20:24.133 --> 01:20:25.954]  Or that your retirement will be secure.
[01:20:26.174 --> 01:20:29.416]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:20:29.556 --> 01:20:33.658]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:20:33.838 --> 01:20:35.399]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:20:35.439 --> 01:20:38.661]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[01:20:38.841 --> 01:20:43.023]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:20:43.204 --> 01:20:43.924]  You should too.
[01:20:44.124 --> 01:20:45.085]  Find out what they know.
[01:20:45.265 --> 01:20:48.126]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well.
[01:20:48.326 --> 01:20:48.606]  Free.
[01:20:48.626 --> 01:20:48.667]  800-686-2237.
[01:20:51.948 --> 01:20:52.088]  800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.468 --> 01:20:54.749]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:54.809 --> 01:21:01.290]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:21:01.310 --> 01:21:03.611]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:21:03.711 --> 01:21:06.532]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:21:06.912 --> 01:21:11.673]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:21:12.033 --> 01:21:16.214]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:21:16.534 --> 01:21:18.855]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:21:18.875 --> 01:21:21.396]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:21:21.756 --> 01:21:24.317]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:21:24.678 --> 01:21:32.281]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:21:32.621 --> 01:21:37.865]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:21:38.005 --> 01:21:40.286]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:21:40.326 --> 01:21:44.309]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:21:44.549 --> 01:21:45.450]  And I got news for you.
[01:21:45.630 --> 01:21:46.931]  You're everyone else.
[01:21:46.971 --> 01:21:47.952]  Invisible Empire.

[01:21:58.982 --> 01:22:01.583]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:22:02.003 --> 01:22:06.944]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:22:07.324 --> 01:22:09.045]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:22:09.365 --> 01:22:14.186]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:22:14.366 --> 01:22:15.326]  How much do you want?
[01:22:15.546 --> 01:22:16.307]  When do you want it?
[01:22:16.667 --> 01:22:18.267]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:22:18.567 --> 01:22:19.387]  When will you need it?
[01:22:19.628 --> 01:22:21.688]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:22:21.828 --> 01:22:22.928]  Will there be any food?
[01:22:23.169 --> 01:22:24.509]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:22:24.689 --> 01:22:25.009]  If there's a
[01:22:25.009 --> 01:22:27.091]  You're in a quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[01:22:27.231 --> 01:22:29.754]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:22:29.954 --> 01:22:33.138]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:22:33.558 --> 01:22:37.042]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:22:37.362 --> 01:22:38.363]  How much will you need?
[01:22:38.603 --> 01:22:39.224]  We don't know.
[01:22:39.504 --> 01:22:40.425]  How much do you want?
[01:22:40.605 --> 01:22:41.326]  All you can get.
[01:22:41.346 --> 01:22:42.367]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:22:42.648 --> 01:22:45.390]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:22:45.691 --> 01:22:45.971]  Call 1-800-4-0-8.
[01:22:47.913 --> 01:22:48.914]  Don't answer it!
[01:22:48.934 --> 01:22:55.299]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings, knowing it may be another bill collector, it's time for you to call Zero Debt in 90 Days.
[01:22:55.319 --> 01:22:55.359]  800-477-9256.
[01:22:55.379 --> 01:23:02.224]  Settlements, bankruptcy, and attorneys are not the answer, and may end up costing you up to 10 times more than necessary.
[01:23:16.715 --> 01:23:20.756]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?

[01:23:49.528 --> 01:23:51.189]  Or call now for free information.
[01:23:51.209 --> 01:23:51.249]  800-477-9256.
[01:23:51.329 --> 01:23:51.510]  That's 800-477-9256.
[01:23:51.530 --> 01:23:53.351]  There's a gun and ammunition just inside the doorway.
[01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:16.813]  Look, we know what the British Empire model has done around the world.
[01:24:16.833 --> 01:24:21.937]  And it's a system of control.
[01:24:23.358 --> 01:24:25.400]  And Dr. John Coleman has written extensively on it.
[01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:26.901]  I found his research to be excellent.
[01:24:28.142 --> 01:24:33.826]  So you were getting into these committees of experts, these shadow governments, that are now out in the open.
[01:24:33.886 --> 01:24:34.887]  It's now not denied.
[01:24:35.227 --> 01:24:37.009]  You'd write about this stuff 30, 40 years ago.
[01:24:37.049 --> 01:24:37.729]  People'd laugh.
[01:24:38.110 --> 01:24:39.391]  Now it's somewhat public.
[01:24:40.342 --> 01:24:49.107]  I want to speak about how those organizations, the command structure that you've identified, and then I want to get into how's their operation going for them?
[01:24:49.727 --> 01:24:58.892]  Because I see them having success, but they're being revealed more and more, and Brzezinski and others have said that they believe they're starting to get into trouble.
[01:25:00.213 --> 01:25:03.475]  Well, I think they've overstepped their bounds as far as being too confident.
[01:25:03.555 --> 01:25:09.058]  I think they've progressed to such a degree that they could now come more and more out into the open.
[01:25:09.835 --> 01:25:11.116]  And I think that was a mistake.
[01:25:11.156 --> 01:25:29.645]  You know, going back to the war years, this was when they really came into their own, through the Strategic Bombing Survey, and through things like the Program Surveys for the Department of Agriculture, from which major studies were undertaken in the techniques of mass persuasion.
[01:25:30.025 --> 01:25:36.209]  You'd never think to look under the Agricultural Department for something called mass persuasion.
[01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:38.850]  I don't think you would unless you were given the key.
[01:25:39.813 --> 01:25:48.161]  But I was told to look over there, and that by the late great Senator Irwin, who helped me so much in my constitutional work.
[01:25:49.001 --> 01:25:55.127]  And there I find that they had all kinds of things hidden under the agricultural book.
[01:25:55.527 --> 01:26:02.794]  For instance, there was a guy called Irwin Cartwright, who wrote a textbook document titled, Some Principles of Mass Persuasion.
[01:26:02.814 --> 01:26:06.037]  And these principles are still in use today.
[01:26:07.208 --> 01:26:18.533]  And another major agency for shaping public opinion was the Office of War Information, which of course has fallen away, but this is just an indication of how these people started out.
[01:26:19.334 --> 01:26:36.242]  They started out from a position of great secrecy, and many of their committees and secret organizations were very difficult to discover because they hid them under different buildings, booths, or I'd say booths in the Congressional Records.
[01:26:36.781 --> 01:26:39.262]  Which had nothing to do with the subject that you're looking for.
[01:26:39.282 --> 01:27:00.091]  I know when I wrote my book on the Constitution, I was told by Senator Ervin to be diligent and to look through all the Congressional records I could find and to date I've read, and I say read like you read a book at a good British university, and I've studied in these things intently and I've covered so far 37,000 pages.
[01:27:02.375 --> 01:27:04.196]  Which I think is something of a record.
[01:27:04.356 --> 01:27:07.017]  I doubt whether there's anybody else in the country that's done that.
[01:27:07.557 --> 01:27:11.598]  And as a result of that, I've gained some rather unique insights into the Constitution.
[01:27:12.699 --> 01:27:28.224]  And one of the big things I find today that is, you know, a sore, an open sore, festering sore in the United States is the fact that so many wars are promulgated without a declaration of war being given by the Congress.
[01:27:28.664 --> 01:27:30.745]  That's a joint session of the House and the Senate.
[01:27:31.790 --> 01:27:36.593]  And I think many of the evils that have arisen from that are plaguing us today more than ever.
[01:27:37.354 --> 01:27:40.176]  It's not a subject that's, you know, gone away.
[01:27:40.196 --> 01:27:47.701]  It's alright to talk about it today because it's very much in sync with what is happening.
[01:27:50.575 --> 01:27:51.696]  Well, this is good news.
[01:27:51.736 --> 01:28:12.153]  I mean, everybody I talk to, not just my own research that I respect and my own gut sense of history, but the statements by the controllers themselves that are, you know, an internal memorandum, not secret, but hidden in plain view, they are talking about facing more and more crises, and they understand that they are starting to lose control.
[01:28:13.274 --> 01:28:16.076]  I think that is, if people aren't aware
[01:28:17.122 --> 01:28:19.903]  of the manipulation, then they're powerless to fight it.
[01:28:20.203 --> 01:28:32.927]  But no matter how sophisticated brainwashing and manipulation is, once you're aware of it and start looking for it, then instead of brainwashing you and pacifying you, it irritates you.
[01:28:33.008 --> 01:28:40.910]  It actually spurs you, like a dog barking next door, to go tell your neighbor to take it inside.
[01:28:41.550 --> 01:28:44.411]  I mean, I see this really starting to turn.
[01:28:44.712 --> 01:28:45.772]  The tide is turning.
[01:28:46.917 --> 01:28:48.377]  I absolutely concur with that.
[01:28:48.738 --> 01:28:49.898]  I think very much so.
[01:28:50.398 --> 01:29:01.821]  And I think more and more it's coming to the realization of American people that their substance, their money has been wasted on wars that they've not thanked, that they've not certified or given their assent to.
[01:29:02.701 --> 01:29:09.763]  I mean, the last time we had a declaration of war, I think was when Truman declared war.
[01:29:09.823 --> 01:29:11.064]  I think that was the last one.
[01:29:11.784 --> 01:29:15.565]  And then, of course, the Second World War was also, but that preceded Truman.
[01:29:16.241 --> 01:29:25.063]  Anyway, those are the few times that we've had a declaration of war, which is a five-step, complicated program that has to be taken.
[01:29:25.123 --> 01:29:32.325]  In fact, the Founding Fathers, they argued and struggled with war for that than they did with anything else in the Constitution.
[01:29:33.125 --> 01:29:36.606]  I've been reading some of the statements they made and
[01:29:37.031 --> 01:29:37.671]  Well, stay there.
[01:29:37.751 --> 01:29:38.852]  Long segment coming up.
[01:29:38.872 --> 01:29:39.832]  That was a short segment.
[01:29:39.852 --> 01:29:47.275]  Let's talk about how big a deal it was and all the checks and balances involved in declaring war versus what is done today.
[01:29:48.995 --> 01:29:49.896]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.396 --> 01:29:51.997]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.917 --> 01:29:55.618]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.323 --> 01:30:00.646]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:30:00.706 --> 01:30:02.929]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:30:03.049 --> 01:30:05.833]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:30:06.253 --> 01:30:10.999]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:15.545]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:30:15.865 --> 01:30:18.188]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:30:18.208 --> 01:30:20.732]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:30:21.092 --> 01:30:23.655]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:30:24.016 --> 01:30:31.606]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:30:31.949 --> 01:30:37.214]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.

[01:31:50.686 --> 01:31:51.527]  Thank you!
[01:31:58.001 --> 01:32:02.885]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:32:02.985 --> 01:32:03.765]  What have we got?
[01:32:03.985 --> 01:32:06.127]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:32:06.427 --> 01:32:07.148]  A republic.
[01:32:07.428 --> 01:32:10.010]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:11.991]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:32:12.352 --> 01:32:14.253]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:32:14.373 --> 01:32:15.654]  So they think they own our land?
[01:32:16.054 --> 01:32:17.175]  They think they own our water?
[01:32:17.375 --> 01:32:17.776]  Children?
[01:32:17.976 --> 01:32:18.776]  Our education?
[01:32:19.097 --> 01:32:19.717]  Our money?
[01:32:19.917 --> 01:32:23.580]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:32:23.940 --> 01:32:27.583]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:32:28.904 --> 01:32:29.725]  We have the facts.
[01:32:29.925 --> 01:32:31.046]  We have the Constitution.
[01:32:31.086 --> 01:32:31.986]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:32:32.006 --> 01:32:32.827]  We have common law.
[01:32:32.887 --> 01:32:35.149]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:33:16.696 --> 01:33:18.498]  Dr. John Coleman is our guest.
[01:33:18.518 --> 01:33:32.269]  We're going back to him in just a moment, and I'm going to throw out some more topical issues, looking at this global empire, what its goals are, what the world will look like if they succeed, how he sees the current battle playing out.
[01:33:32.289 --> 01:33:36.693]  He's been very accurate in the past and forecasting what he thought would happen in the future.
[01:33:37.333 --> 01:33:38.734]  So we'll be talking to him again in a moment.
[01:33:38.754 --> 01:33:40.976]  I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that I really believe in.
[01:33:41.977 --> 01:33:44.579]  And who made today's radio broadcast possible.
[01:33:44.659 --> 01:33:46.861]  One of them is MySolarBackup.com.
[01:33:46.921 --> 01:33:50.424]  Our listeners, we've been promoting this for almost three years, love this system.
[01:33:50.985 --> 01:33:57.891]  You can get a whole bunch of these and run your whole house or just get one and run your shed where you're doing tinkering or woodwork or whatever.
[01:33:58.331 --> 01:33:59.412]  Or it's great for camping.
[01:33:59.432 --> 01:34:04.076]  Or it can run several big appliances or more.
[01:34:06.158 --> 01:34:10.700]  The solar panel, the little control unit, and the battery system, MySolarBackup.com.
[01:34:10.740 --> 01:34:14.701]  That's MySolarBackup.com, one word, or 877-327-0365.

[01:34:26.746 --> 01:34:27.147]  Again, that's 877-327-0365.
[01:34:30.988 --> 01:34:37.538]  Uh, and, uh, one other, uh, well, several other things that actually deal with preparedness is a cola blue.
[01:34:38.519 --> 01:34:43.086]  The atmospheric water generator, and it grabs the water right out of the air.
[01:34:44.301 --> 01:34:49.746]  via condensation and puts it through seven to twelve filters, depending on which unit you buy.
[01:34:50.086 --> 01:34:55.530]  They have units that are seven and a half gallons a day, the smallest, up to units that would supply an entire army battalion.
[01:34:55.610 --> 01:34:58.233]  They sent quite a few of these to the relief effort in Haiti.
[01:34:59.093 --> 01:34:59.934]  Wonderful folks.
[01:35:00.134 --> 01:35:01.395]  Ecolablue.com.
[01:35:01.455 --> 01:35:01.976]  Check them out.

[01:35:08.941 --> 01:35:10.041]  800-691-6043.
[01:35:10.661 --> 01:35:13.242]  That's 800-691-6043.
[01:35:13.622 --> 01:35:15.462]  The cleanest, best water you can get.
[01:35:15.842 --> 01:35:16.362]  Period.
[01:35:16.783 --> 01:35:17.543]  Right out of the air.
[01:35:17.623 --> 01:35:19.123]  Weebree of thecolablue.com.
[01:35:19.663 --> 01:35:24.004]  And finally, you'll never stand in a bread line, my friends, if you have your own bread.
[01:35:24.824 --> 01:35:30.605]  And I just saw a mainstream news headline a minute ago on InfoWars that we had linked that said, Will Americans starve?
[01:35:31.205 --> 01:35:33.306]  They're trying to kick people off their unemployment benefits.
[01:35:33.326 --> 01:35:34.646]  They've de-industrialized us.
[01:35:36.083 --> 01:35:40.172]  Uh, they want to have you jump through hoops and drug tests now to be able to get your unemployment.
[01:35:40.192 --> 01:35:42.437]  Uh, you know, the government wants your fluids.
[01:35:42.477 --> 01:35:43.580]  They want to set that precedent.
[01:35:45.219 --> 01:35:52.384]  The point is, things are crazy, and you need to get high-quality, non-GMO, non-hybrid, storable foods that's recently made.
[01:35:52.484 --> 01:35:54.205]  As in, every month, they make the food new.
[01:35:54.245 --> 01:35:58.107]  The biggest, longest-continually operating company, the place where I get my storable food.
[01:35:58.127 --> 01:36:00.849]  You've got to really beware some of the other companies out there.
[01:36:00.889 --> 01:36:02.971]  You can really believe in eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:36:03.011 --> 01:36:05.192]  They are the leader, and they have the best prices.
[01:36:05.592 --> 01:36:09.395]  eFoodsDirect.com, the letter E, foodsdirect.com, or 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633.
[01:36:14.218 --> 01:36:20.396]  With the talk of war, the ongoing recession, depression, you need to have this insurance you can eat, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:20.919 --> 01:36:23.300]  All right, going back to our guest, Dr. John Coleman.
[01:36:23.620 --> 01:36:30.804]  Doc, give us a website for folks that want to be able to check out your books, or your writings, or some of the other materials that you have.
[01:36:31.585 --> 01:36:33.185]  Well, our website is very complete.
[01:36:33.265 --> 01:36:40.969]  It's quite a substantial website, and you'll find everything you need to know about me and my work up there, all of the books.
[01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:42.270]  And it's very simple.
[01:36:42.290 --> 01:36:43.751]  It is Coleman, C-O-L-E-M-A-N.
[01:36:46.678 --> 01:36:55.065]  Three zero zero dot com Coleman three hundred dot com and everything you could want to know about me and all of my books are up there.
[01:36:56.386 --> 01:36:58.087]  As well as the number to call to order.
[01:36:58.707 --> 01:36:59.388]  Absolutely.
[01:36:59.468 --> 01:37:04.352]  Now, continuing in the last twenty four minutes or so we have left.
[01:37:06.493 --> 01:37:13.199]  In layman's terms for folks, from your deep study over forty years, what is the Globalist's end game plan?
[01:37:13.699 --> 01:37:14.440]  What is their
[01:37:15.609 --> 01:37:35.826]  Final operation, because from their own documents I've read, it's establish a world government, isolate the individual, break up the family, and then through covert, GMO food, poisons in the water, and drugs, basically anesthetize, sterilize, and reduce world population.
[01:37:36.806 --> 01:37:38.447]  That's correct, that's absolutely right.
[01:37:38.467 --> 01:37:39.788]  There's all of those and more.
[01:37:39.808 --> 01:37:49.015]  For instance, some of the companies, like Monsanto, are producing seed that you have to... You can't harvest some of it and then plant it again next year.
[01:37:49.035 --> 01:37:50.636]  You have to buy new seed all the time.
[01:37:51.036 --> 01:37:53.218]  And it doesn't... The shelf life of it is pretty short.
[01:37:53.618 --> 01:37:54.639]  Things of that nature.
[01:37:55.059 --> 01:38:04.106]  In other words, the supply of food will be lessened to such an extent that... You know, there's a senior statesman, Lord Bertrand Russell,
[01:38:06.078 --> 01:38:09.480]  We said that the world is populated with too many useless eaters.
[01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:11.741]  That's the likes of us, you and me.
[01:38:12.421 --> 01:38:14.782]  And he said, something has to be done about it.
[01:38:14.802 --> 01:38:17.384]  He said what we need to do is reintroduce a plague.
[01:38:17.984 --> 01:38:26.028]  That will happen every now and then and wipe away at least 20 million of the population, which he called was surplus to our requirements.
[01:38:26.728 --> 01:38:33.952]  And then he said we have a manageable population, will not only be subservient, but very easy to control.
[01:38:35.103 --> 01:38:37.385]  They will be dependent on the government for everything.
[01:38:37.405 --> 01:38:43.170]  So that, basically, is the blueprint for the new world order.
[01:38:43.190 --> 01:38:44.411]  One world government.
[01:38:46.052 --> 01:38:47.774]  Please continue, please continue.
[01:38:48.775 --> 01:38:50.356]  Adjust our population.
[01:38:53.219 --> 01:38:58.103]  And then they, in turn, are controlled by what I would call the top dogs in the Committee of 300.
[01:38:58.183 --> 01:38:59.984]  And there are many of them.
[01:39:00.205 --> 01:39:01.826]  In America, we have some families of...
[01:39:03.354 --> 01:39:06.357]  And of course in England you have the loyalty.
[01:39:06.937 --> 01:39:11.601]  Some of the old European kings and queens are still alive and still controlling this body as well.
[01:39:12.702 --> 01:39:14.684]  And it's a very comprehensive machine.
[01:39:15.604 --> 01:39:18.547]  It's rather like a manufacturing company.
[01:39:19.067 --> 01:39:21.649]  At the top you have the CEO.
[01:39:21.990 --> 01:39:23.531]  Then you have the board of directors.
[01:39:24.071 --> 01:39:25.413]  Then you have the management.
[01:39:25.433 --> 01:39:26.654]  Then you have the middle management.
[01:39:26.754 --> 01:39:30.517]  Then you have all the controllers on the shop floors.
[01:39:31.329 --> 01:39:37.257]  And so on and so forth, right down to the lowest individual working in the packing department to ship the goods.
[01:39:37.877 --> 01:39:43.685]  And this is really the format for the New World Order that I hope to achieve.
[01:39:44.710 --> 01:39:49.171]  And they all brag about it, they all write about it, and talk about what mindless scum we are.
[01:39:49.511 --> 01:40:03.155]  And from my research, but correct me if I'm wrong and expand on it, these are the ultimate control freaks, and the ultimate jealous, envious people, to the point of they want to control the future, they only want their progeny to go into the future.
[01:40:04.275 --> 01:40:06.477]  And they hate healthy, happy people.
[01:40:06.837 --> 01:40:09.820]  They hate individual wealth and middle classes.
[01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:16.625]  They hate... I mean, their true pleasure is death and sickness and illness and people being dumbed down.
[01:40:16.665 --> 01:40:20.268]  And they revel in how they're poisoning us and dumbing us down.
[01:40:20.708 --> 01:40:30.376]  And it's really their ultimate mass psychopathic orchestra or symphony of destruction to be carrying this out.
[01:40:31.172 --> 01:40:37.376]  Well, the leader who wrote the score, as I said, of this concerto was Lord Bertrand Russell.
[01:40:37.737 --> 01:40:39.438]  And that's exactly his point of view.
[01:40:39.738 --> 01:40:40.899]  There are far too many of us.
[01:40:40.959 --> 01:40:41.900]  We're too rebellious.
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:43.361]  We're too independent.
[01:40:43.401 --> 01:40:47.584]  We need to be thinned out by plagues that are coming every year.
[01:40:47.804 --> 01:40:50.966]  He said, actually, that the wars have been very disappointing.
[01:40:50.986 --> 01:40:52.527]  They haven't killed enough people.
[01:40:53.087 --> 01:40:57.951]  And when you think of the horrendous casualties of World War I,
[01:40:59.082 --> 01:41:03.865]  Then you get some idea of the extent of what these people are trying to do.
[01:41:22.136 --> 01:41:37.037]  he had the discover the double helix he had to step down but they kept it quiet because he's a you know kind of uh... the uh... holdren's hero and when you actually study these liberals they are the biggest racist and
[01:41:38.038 --> 01:41:43.981]  But they're not just wanting to kill who they see as subhuman, they also are threatened by what they call wild sons.
[01:41:44.401 --> 01:41:52.186]  And they say, eugenics isn't just positive and negative, it's also dumbing down the middle class that could threaten them.
[01:41:52.246 --> 01:41:55.407]  So they're also, because so many yuppies say, yeah, there's too many people.
[01:41:55.807 --> 01:42:00.990]  It's kind of a little secret liberal enjoyment to go, oh yes, well, we do have too many people.
[01:42:01.010 --> 01:42:01.671]  Ha ha ha.
[01:42:02.611 --> 01:42:03.531]  Exactly, they're unaware of that.
[01:42:03.591 --> 01:42:04.552]  We all target, all of us.
[01:42:04.572 --> 01:42:07.433]  When they've reduced one sector, they're going to go after the next, and so on.
[01:42:07.453 --> 01:42:09.814]  There's nobody else who's going to escape their attention.
[01:42:25.353 --> 01:42:34.016]  Well, as long, Doc, as we expose these people and really state how evil they are, I don't see how they're going to get away with this.
[01:42:34.036 --> 01:42:37.877]  And I think that's why they're rushing now to openly start shutting the web down.
[01:42:38.117 --> 01:42:40.078]  But that's only a bigger wake-up call.
[01:42:40.938 --> 01:42:41.458]  Exactly.
[01:42:41.498 --> 01:42:47.620]  This latest idea that they can have some key and shut off the Internet is a very, very dangerous one.
[01:42:47.660 --> 01:42:54.362]  But it should be a wake-up call to all Americans, even those who don't bother to read books, who don't bother to follow the news.
[01:42:56.027 --> 01:43:02.274]  It's a welcome call to all of these people if they'll stop and think for a while.
[01:43:03.015 --> 01:43:12.926]  And I think this latest effort to provide a key to shut off the internet is probably one of the most dangerous propositions that has come around for a very long time.
[01:43:15.302 --> 01:43:20.607]  Well, it shows that their arrogance has evaporated, which I think is a sad thing.
[01:43:20.687 --> 01:43:28.895]  I wish they were still full of hubris and chutzpah and arrogant false aplomb because we could sneak up on them.
[01:43:29.355 --> 01:43:33.659]  They now realize that we are very close to their throat.
[01:43:34.780 --> 01:43:36.862]  Yes, and that's making them all the more cautious.
[01:43:37.589 --> 01:43:44.710]  And not many of their directors are coded today, and it's difficult to understand what they're trying to get, what they're trying to say.
[01:43:44.750 --> 01:43:48.611]  Except, of course, insiders who have the keys that are not the codes, they know.
[01:43:49.111 --> 01:43:51.592]  But the mass of us people are very good at it.
[01:43:51.612 --> 01:43:53.892]  We're not supposed to know any of these things.
[01:43:54.972 --> 01:44:03.994]  I was talking to a well-known doctor, and off record, she said that she'd treated a head of state
[01:44:05.060 --> 01:44:14.708]  Who's a female, a current head of state who's a female, and who said, yes, I don't really know if I want to go through with this, doctor, because they know they can talk to their doctor.
[01:44:14.728 --> 01:44:16.689]  You know, I have been raised to be an elitist.
[01:44:16.709 --> 01:44:18.090]  We are setting up a world government.
[01:44:18.491 --> 01:44:24.576]  The extermination that we've been beta testing as soft kill is supposed to accelerate, and I don't know if I want to go through with this.
[01:44:25.296 --> 01:44:36.645]  And so I think as they try to really force their New World Order through, and we've already pre-warned everyone, that I think we've planted booby traps for them into the future that are going to defeat them.
[01:44:37.486 --> 01:44:38.827]  I think that's exactly right.
[01:44:39.107 --> 01:44:40.248]  I believe that's the way to go.
[01:44:40.268 --> 01:44:46.493]  We have to continue to plant these hidden mines where they don't see them and can't skip over them and get blown up.
[01:44:46.773 --> 01:44:47.474]  That's what we need.
[01:44:48.001 --> 01:44:56.685]  But you know, we don't have people like George Bush Singer anymore, who when he came into power he proudly announced that he was all for the New World Order.
[01:44:56.985 --> 01:45:00.007]  He said that's what we need and we need a complete change in society.
[01:45:00.947 --> 01:45:02.268]  But today they're more cautious.
[01:45:03.939 --> 01:45:14.047]  Well, they have been to a certain extent, but we have seen Herman Van Rompuy and Gordon Brown and Ban Ki-moon of the UN say global government is the answer to the financial crisis.
[01:45:14.367 --> 01:45:18.831]  We must pay carbon taxes to the very central banks that engineered the collapse.
[01:45:19.672 --> 01:45:20.112]  Oh, indeed.
[01:45:20.132 --> 01:45:21.113]  I saw that as well.
[01:45:21.133 --> 01:45:24.135]  The British Prime Minister, he was quite outspoken about it.
[01:45:25.076 --> 01:45:28.399]  But I think some of the American counterparts are not quite so bold.
[01:45:28.679 --> 01:45:29.279]  No, I agree.
[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:33.443]  They have tried to still keep the lid on things to a certain extent.
[01:45:41.184 --> 01:45:45.587]  Let's shift gears and talk about your book, Drug War Against America.
[01:45:47.589 --> 01:45:55.175]  I mean, CIA aircraft crashing full of pure cocaine from the source, now they just admit that we're growing the opium in Afghanistan, but we can't
[01:45:56.341 --> 01:45:58.602]  They want to keep it illegal because they make more money out of it.
[01:45:58.622 --> 01:46:07.227]  If it's legal, they might be able to tax it to a certain extent, but that would be all.
[01:46:07.247 --> 01:46:13.430]  But this way, they can make enormous profits out of the sale of the product as well.
[01:46:13.530 --> 01:46:15.491]  And scarcity is what controls the price.
[01:46:24.770 --> 01:46:30.052]  It's a scarce commodity, so of course the prices can go right through the ceiling and people will still buy.
[01:46:30.092 --> 01:46:34.614]  America, of course, the biggest narcotics-consuming country in the world.
[01:46:35.094 --> 01:46:44.537]  And the Mexican government, for instance, constantly complains that we don't do enough in America to stop the drug trade in America except to shut down.
[01:46:44.557 --> 01:46:51.220]  There'd be no need for these people to produce such huge quantities of cocaine and heroin and so forth.
[01:46:52.501 --> 01:46:56.682]  And you know, countries like Colombia, we have stationed enormous forces down there.
[01:46:57.343 --> 01:47:04.785]  But I don't think they're doing any good because Colombia doesn't grow any of the bush that produces cocaine.
[01:47:05.685 --> 01:47:10.247]  That's all grown in other countries, like Ecuador and Bolivia.
[01:47:11.567 --> 01:47:13.288]  And those countries, they grow it.
[01:47:13.568 --> 01:47:14.308]  They grow the bush.
[01:47:15.549 --> 01:47:15.829]  Well,
[01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:55.255]  The skinning I've gotten from Terry Reid who is CIA and many others and what's come out in congressional hearings is the argument is we must deal the drugs, that is the government, or most the drugs, or someone else will take over this market and then they will get power out of the market and supplant American hegemony.
[01:47:55.615 --> 01:47:56.756]  But that's not what's happening.
[01:47:56.776 --> 01:48:02.942]  You decriminalize, then that wipes out the price structure as it was 90 years ago when these drugs were legal here.
[01:48:03.322 --> 01:48:04.743]  Far fewer people used it.
[01:48:05.824 --> 01:48:08.485]  You could buy cocaine, heroin at the corner store.
[01:48:08.705 --> 01:48:10.506]  You could send your kid down there to get it for you.
[01:48:11.486 --> 01:48:13.027]  But most people didn't use it.
[01:48:13.467 --> 01:48:14.207]  They know that.
[01:48:14.887 --> 01:48:25.311]  And they want to keep it illegal so that even if the big central banks don't control all of it being shipped in, they control most of it, the money still gets laundered through them.
[01:48:26.251 --> 01:48:31.293]  And so that's why they're going to keep the drug trade wide open and forever.
[01:48:31.573 --> 01:48:33.954]  I mean, if they want to put the fire out, they decriminalize.
[01:48:34.679 --> 01:48:35.420]  Exactly right.
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:40.224]  Of course, it's all a question of who gets the money and how much of it.
[01:48:40.244 --> 01:48:43.026]  I mean, you take this enormous drug trade.
[01:48:43.887 --> 01:48:47.850]  Although we're fighting in Afghanistan, we have gone in there.
[01:48:47.930 --> 01:48:50.612]  I don't quite know what our objective is in Afghanistan.
[01:48:51.053 --> 01:48:52.374]  I don't think many people do.
[01:48:52.914 --> 01:49:02.182]  But since we've been fighting a war there, the production of the opium from poppy, raw opium, has gone up from 4,000 metric tons a year to 6,000 a year.
[01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:13.627]  Actually, the numbers I've seen is that it doubled within a few years, tripled, quadrupled, and just went up exponentially.
[01:49:13.807 --> 01:49:14.988]  That may even be an old number.
[01:49:15.749 --> 01:49:20.353]  Now, it's over 90% of world opium production is in Afghanistan.
[01:49:21.093 --> 01:49:22.454]  That wouldn't surprise me in the least.
[01:49:23.095 --> 01:49:27.759]  Because everything is right for the climate, the soil, and the people.
[01:49:28.279 --> 01:49:29.080]  It's their way of life.
[01:49:31.518 --> 01:49:35.842]  You wipe out a poppy field, what are you going to give the peasants who are growing it?
[01:49:36.483 --> 01:49:37.364]  We tried that before.
[01:49:37.404 --> 01:49:41.607]  We tried them to grow vegetables and they just couldn't make anything out of it.
[01:49:41.667 --> 01:49:42.028]  No money.
[01:49:42.048 --> 01:49:43.609]  They couldn't cope with it.
[01:49:43.629 --> 01:49:48.593]  So as soon as the troops had passed through, they went right back to growing poppies again and opium.
[01:49:49.314 --> 01:49:55.319]  And of course, you know, Pakistan is one of the main routes out of Afghanistan.
[01:49:55.339 --> 01:49:55.800]  They go through
[01:49:58.763 --> 01:50:02.624]  And all these big generals in the army of Pakistan, they all take their cut out of it.
[01:50:03.164 --> 01:50:16.109]  These caravans leave Afghanistan, they go down through the, uh, towards the coastline, through the desert, Makar Desert, and they come out on the coastline, there's nothing there but desert, and it's impossible to follow them.
[01:50:16.669 --> 01:50:21.851]  They do send planes, and then these people, they hide when they know the planes are coming, because they're tipped off.
[01:50:22.491 --> 01:50:25.852]  And they hide in a few caves that are around, and they go at night, mainly.
[01:50:26.576 --> 01:50:44.812]  And they get down to the, uh, the Mekong coast and there's all these Arab girls working to take the boatloads of cocaine over to, oh, I'm sorry, opium poppies over to the British Bank of the Middle East in Doha, just across the, um, not Doha, just across the British Bank of the Middle East.
[01:50:46.559 --> 01:50:48.180]  All right, Dr. John Coleman, stay there.
[01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:50.582]  We're going to come back in the final segment and talk about Iran.
[01:50:50.922 --> 01:50:53.865]  The Iranians say they're going to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza.
[01:50:53.925 --> 01:50:55.726]  Israel vows to fight back.
[01:50:56.046 --> 01:50:56.507]  Stay with us.
[01:50:58.968 --> 01:51:02.291]  It's the number one reason for slow and clogged bath drains.
[01:51:02.572 --> 01:51:03.873]  That's right, hair.
[01:51:04.233 --> 01:51:07.176]  And the number one way to open drains plugged with hair?
[01:51:07.456 --> 01:51:08.517]  The drain claw.
[01:51:09.358 --> 01:51:11.300]  Stop standing in dirty bath water.
[01:51:11.540 --> 01:51:13.202]  Stop using dangerous chemicals.
[01:51:13.442 --> 01:51:17.886]  Just push the drain claw past the pop-up in your sink or tub, twist, and pull.
[01:51:17.906 --> 01:51:21.550]  You'll be shocked at what this little tool can pull out of your drain.
[01:51:21.790 --> 01:51:28.796]  The Drain Claw has over 100 tiny hooks that claw through hair, toothpaste and shampoo that slows and clogs your drains.

[01:52:02.780 --> 01:52:03.701]  Tyranny is here.
[01:52:04.041 --> 01:52:07.643]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:52:07.903 --> 01:52:10.184]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:52:10.204 --> 01:52:15.307]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:52:17.227 --> 01:52:22.328]  This documentary proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:52:22.708 --> 01:52:28.270]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:52:28.690 --> 01:52:32.391]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:52:32.871 --> 01:52:36.872]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:52:37.152 --> 01:52:42.693]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:52:43.093 --> 01:52:45.994]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:52:46.654 --> 01:52:48.056]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:52:48.617 --> 01:52:49.098]  It's here.

[01:52:57.816 --> 01:53:00.860]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:04.805]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:53:05.105 --> 01:53:08.570]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[01:53:08.830 --> 01:53:16.800]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants from
[01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:23.708]  For municipal water, these filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems.
[01:53:23.988 --> 01:53:28.513]  From the smallest to the largest systems, BigBerkyWaterFilters.com has what you need.
[01:53:28.834 --> 01:53:31.417]  With your system purchase, you'll receive a shower filter,
[01:53:31.817 --> 01:53:32.157]  I think so.
[01:54:01.192 --> 01:54:02.453]  All right, final segment.
[01:54:02.533 --> 01:54:04.234]  We'll be back tomorrow live at 11 a.m.
[01:54:04.294 --> 01:54:05.115]  to 3 p.m.
[01:54:05.255 --> 01:54:05.755]  Central.
[01:54:07.856 --> 01:54:09.477]  Dr. John Coleman is our guest.
[01:54:09.678 --> 01:54:11.539]  I want to ask him about Iran in just a moment.
[01:54:11.579 --> 01:54:17.543]  We'll close out the broadcast, but we do have Lord Christopher Monckton on the latest on the global carbon tax joining us for an hour tomorrow.
[01:54:18.123 --> 01:54:19.804]  Also, Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[01:54:20.124 --> 01:54:24.467]  Highest ratings ever with the first week of his new show on the Fox Business Network.
[01:54:25.047 --> 01:54:26.388]  He'll be joining us.
[01:54:26.408 --> 01:54:26.749]  We got
[01:54:28.507 --> 01:54:30.929]  Former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura joining us Friday.
[01:54:30.949 --> 01:54:33.251]  And by the way, he's not on a speaking or radio tour right now.
[01:54:33.271 --> 01:54:35.673]  You notice you only see him about two or three times a year.
[01:54:35.773 --> 01:54:38.816]  He's doing this separate because I'm consulting on his TV show.
[01:54:39.236 --> 01:54:46.783]  We'll talk about a host of issues with Jesse Ventura coming up on Friday for a full hour and some other surprise guests as well in the next two days.
[01:54:47.563 --> 01:54:55.831]  Separately, I was watching Fox during the break and they were admitting that Prozac and Zoloft and all this stuff is causing heart attacks and brain damage and
[01:54:57.458 --> 01:54:59.919]  And I've read that, and I pulled up the medical literature.
[01:54:59.939 --> 01:55:02.140]  I know it causes suicide, and there it was.
[01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:05.221]  Man, I tell you, this stuff is really starting to come out.
[01:55:06.342 --> 01:55:09.083]  We've got an article up on Infowars.com.
[01:55:09.443 --> 01:55:11.704]  Israeli vows to tighten Gaza blockade.
[01:55:12.304 --> 01:55:13.105]  Gaza blockade.
[01:55:13.225 --> 01:55:13.545]  U.S.
[01:55:13.645 --> 01:55:15.706]  media reports blockade eaves.
[01:55:15.766 --> 01:55:16.766]  So who knows what's happening?
[01:55:17.246 --> 01:55:19.647]  Iran to send blockade-busting ship to Gaza.
[01:55:19.687 --> 01:55:20.948]  Look, I don't want a war on Iran.
[01:55:21.806 --> 01:55:22.747]  We know they don't have nukes.
[01:55:23.268 --> 01:55:25.030]  We know they don't have Al-Qaeda in their country.
[01:55:25.070 --> 01:55:26.071]  We know that's all made up.
[01:55:26.672 --> 01:55:30.657]  But at the same time, Iran... Dr. John Coleman, what do you think they're doing?
[01:55:30.697 --> 01:55:35.323]  I mean, I don't want World War III to start, but isn't this provocative of Iran to be doing this?
[01:55:35.343 --> 01:55:37.585]  Just asking for Israel to nuke them?
[01:55:38.206 --> 01:55:42.790]  Yes, I think this is the closest we've been for a long time to the 3rd World War starting.
[01:55:43.411 --> 01:55:48.115]  And if anybody makes a misstep in this situation, that's what's going to happen.
[01:55:48.635 --> 01:55:52.098]  I think we're very close to a 3rd World War unless Kool-Aid prevails.
[01:55:52.659 --> 01:55:56.782]  And I don't see anybody big enough and strong enough to be that Kool-Aid.
[01:55:57.483 --> 01:55:59.665]  So we live in very perilous times.
[01:56:01.146 --> 01:56:03.969]  Why do the global controllers want to attack Iran?
[01:56:05.267 --> 01:56:06.147]  Why do they want to?
[01:56:06.407 --> 01:56:06.647]  Yes.
[01:56:07.188 --> 01:56:09.788]  Because Iran wants to get nuclear weapons of its own.
[01:56:09.808 --> 01:56:17.111]  That says that if Israel can have nuclear weapons, and if India and Pakistan can have them, why not them?
[01:56:17.691 --> 01:56:23.773]  But what they've been enriching, they even tried to send their uranium out of the country to prove that this was non-nuclear.
[01:56:25.233 --> 01:56:27.314]  But I mean, you do think they do want to get nukes?
[01:56:27.754 --> 01:56:29.074]  Well, definitely.
[01:56:29.595 --> 01:56:31.855]  I don't think there's any doubt about it whatsoever.
[01:56:32.796 --> 01:56:33.756]  I doubt it very much.
[01:56:34.707 --> 01:56:38.429]  You know, my book is told very widely in the Committee of Clearance here.
[01:56:38.509 --> 01:56:41.411]  I'm in a strange situation, but there it is.
[01:56:41.951 --> 01:56:48.195]  And the people I'm in contact with tell me that they feel that war is very, very imminent.
[01:56:49.856 --> 01:57:03.284]  And they think that the story that is prevailing to prevent the nuclear armament of their rockets is going to be the focal point, which will be the flashpoint that will start it.
[01:57:04.704 --> 01:57:14.269]  Well, we have our sources inside Bilderberg, which of course is a subset of what you call the Committee of 300, and they, for the first time, according to Jim Tucker and others, are green-lighting an attack on Iran.
[01:57:14.889 --> 01:57:20.372]  Now, that doesn't mean it's 100%, but do you agree that having Bilderberg sign off on it's a bad sign?
[01:57:21.212 --> 01:57:23.253]  I think that anything they agree to is bad.
[01:57:24.474 --> 01:57:32.078]  I doubt very much, you know, anything that the society has done about Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands and the town of Bilderberg in Holland.
[01:57:32.808 --> 01:57:40.335]  And everything that's come out of there has been nothing but the worst type of publications the world has ever seen.
[01:57:40.355 --> 01:57:43.038]  So anything they approve, I think is bad news for us.
[01:57:43.739 --> 01:57:46.842]  Alright, Dr. John Coleman, we look forward to speaking to you again in the future.
[01:57:46.922 --> 01:57:48.463]  It's Coleman300.com.
[01:57:48.844 --> 01:57:49.905]  Thanks for spending time with us.
[01:57:50.580 --> 01:57:52.241]  I just want to make one correction quick, people.
[01:57:52.261 --> 01:57:56.023]  I may have said stuff wrong in regard to the French Plain to the Middle East.
[01:57:56.303 --> 01:57:58.904]  It's Dubai where the center is.
[01:57:58.925 --> 01:57:59.305]  Sure.
[01:57:59.665 --> 01:57:59.905]  Sure.
