[00:00:05.373 --> 00:00:10.217]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.217 --> 00:00:11.798]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.798 --> 00:00:13.360]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.543]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.543 --> 00:00:27.511]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:29.293]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:29.293 --> 00:00:31.414]  It is Tuesday, the 27th day of July, 2010.
[00:00:34.394 --> 00:00:38.177]  This year is already getting long in the tooth.
[00:00:38.177 --> 00:00:46.382]  We've got Chuck Baldwin, Constitution Party presidential candidate, 2008, joining us to talk about his article, D.C.
[00:00:46.382 --> 00:00:53.727]  declares war on the states, coming up in the last 30 minutes of the broadcast today.
[00:00:53.727 --> 00:01:01.233]  We're going to cover a ton of vitally important news as the acceleration towards war with Iran and Venezuela
[00:01:03.382 --> 00:01:04.463]  Accelerates.
[00:01:04.463 --> 00:01:11.070]  We're also going to get into the latest WikiLeaks developments as we get more intel on that.
[00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:27.546]  And also we had a caller yesterday in the middle of the second hour from Texas who said he was at Fort Hood and had come back from Iraq in the last few months and that while he was there they were training Austin's SWAT team commander and others.
[00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.920]  Yeah.
[00:01:48.581 --> 00:01:51.205]  So I knew that some police in the U.S.
[00:01:51.205 --> 00:01:57.734]  are being sent to Iraq to be trained for this, and covertly the military is illegally running checkpoints all over the country already.
[00:01:57.734 --> 00:02:02.281]  That's even come out in the mainstream news, and they've announced Brigade Homeland that they want to have 400,000 troops on the streets.
[00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:10.386]  So we understand that whole backstory and of course this year we released the film Police State 4 The Rise of FEMA.
[00:02:10.386 --> 00:02:17.888]  I hadn't made a police state film in nine years and this documentary breaks all of those developments that have happened since then.
[00:02:17.888 --> 00:02:28.151]  So I believed the caller just because I was already aware some of that was going on but I searched the term Austin Police Iraq and I found a bunch of mainstream news articles
[00:02:29.201 --> 00:02:31.725]  Including this one that we added to that YouTube video.
[00:02:31.725 --> 00:02:35.292]  A little seven minute clip with the caller.
[00:02:35.292 --> 00:02:38.036]  It's an article, Brave Rifles train with APD.
[00:02:41.055 --> 00:02:48.940]  And it talks about the Austin police and judges and others learning how the military basically takes over society.
[00:02:48.940 --> 00:03:04.568]  And they spin it to say that the police are training the military, but at the bottom of the article they admit actually the military is training us and the commander of the Austin SWAT team and the commander of the Austin intelligence, police intelligence, were sent to Baghdad.
[00:03:04.568 --> 00:03:06.169]  They talk about it here.
[00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:08.271]  So exactly who the caller said was there.
[00:03:09.051 --> 00:03:11.333]  The head of the SWAT team and the head of intelligence.
[00:03:11.333 --> 00:03:14.014]  They're right here with photographs.
[00:03:14.014 --> 00:03:15.075]  They're high-res photos.
[00:03:15.075 --> 00:03:17.917]  You can blow it up and look at their faces.
[00:03:17.917 --> 00:03:21.059]  At the Fort Hood Sentinel.
[00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:22.280]  So, it's real.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.040]  It's true.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.861]  Everything the caller said, documented.
[00:03:24.861 --> 00:03:25.522]  Okay?
[00:03:25.522 --> 00:03:26.503]  In your face.
[00:03:26.503 --> 00:03:32.286]  And even after we posted this article under the video, the disinfo operatives are in that video.
[00:03:32.286 --> 00:03:37.530]  Soldier says Austin SWAT team training for checkpoints in U.S.
[00:03:39.807 --> 00:03:48.709]  They are there saying it isn't true, even though there's an article from Mainstream News interviewing the SWAT team commander saying it.
[00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:54.491]  So, that is the spirit of denial that has infested this country and is bringing this country down.
[00:03:54.491 --> 00:03:55.771]  We're in a depression.
[00:03:55.771 --> 00:03:57.892]  They're getting ready for World War III publicly.
[00:03:57.892 --> 00:04:00.513]  That's in the news today.
[00:04:00.513 --> 00:04:05.914]  They're openly saying they're going to censor and take over the internet.
[00:04:05.914 --> 00:04:08.235]  The kill switch is now past the Senate committee.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.884]  And people are in denial.
[00:04:13.884 --> 00:04:22.492]  So, coming up in the next hour, I'm going to get into this Fort Hood situation and break that down.
[00:04:22.492 --> 00:04:27.898]  But first, I want to get into this Reuters headline.
[00:04:27.898 --> 00:04:30.581]  Ahmed Denegide says he expects U.S.
[00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:33.244]  to attack Mideast soon and one other country.
[00:04:34.494 --> 00:04:35.054]  U.S.
[00:04:35.054 --> 00:04:38.897]  Psywar planned includes two hot wars.
[00:04:38.897 --> 00:04:41.879]  North Korea warns of nuclear response to naval exercises.
[00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:43.821]  Bloomberg.
[00:04:43.821 --> 00:04:45.802]  It's all coming up today.
[00:04:45.802 --> 00:04:51.266]  The real issues, the things that actually affect you and your family and humanity.
[00:04:51.266 --> 00:04:53.728]  Not Lindsay Lohan, not Mel Gibson.
[00:04:53.728 --> 00:04:55.109]  You're not going to hear any of that here.
[00:04:56.317 --> 00:04:58.559]  Very important broadcast lined up today.
[00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:00.441]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[00:05:00.441 --> 00:05:04.824]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar powered generator.
[00:05:04.824 --> 00:05:09.168]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:09.168 --> 00:05:14.553]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:14.913 --> 00:05:15.654]  It's true.
[00:05:15.654 --> 00:05:21.358]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:21.358 --> 00:05:24.941]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:29.644]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:29.644 --> 00:05:32.426]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:32.426 --> 00:05:35.749]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:41.010]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:46.072]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:05:46.072 --> 00:05:50.233]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:50.233 --> 00:05:52.033]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:52.033 --> 00:05:56.634]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:06:00.427 --> 00:06:03.250]  Thousands of Americans are facing evacuation.
[00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:08.555]  If you or any of your loved ones might need to evacuate, you must do it yourselves.
[00:06:08.555 --> 00:06:11.358]  Please don't procrastinate until they do it for you.
[00:06:11.358 --> 00:06:15.041]  Remember the terrible conditions of those that didn't get out for Katrina.
[00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:21.047]  Go right now to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex or call 800-409-5633 for information on the new evacuation pack.
[00:06:25.231 --> 00:06:30.652]  It contains two weeks of delicious easy-to-fix food along with the equipment to prepare it.
[00:06:30.652 --> 00:06:33.733]  It's packed in a rugged heavy-duty tote for transport.
[00:06:33.733 --> 00:06:38.134]  Evacuations are looming with the storms and the Gulf oil catastrophe.
[00:06:38.134 --> 00:06:43.475]  No matter where you live, wildfires, earthquakes, floods, and storms must be escaped.
[00:06:43.475 --> 00:06:47.016]  Don't be like a deer frozen in the headlights of oncoming disaster.
[00:06:47.316 --> 00:06:52.383]  At least prepare yourself with this two-week evacuation pack from efoodsdirect.com.
[00:06:52.383 --> 00:06:52.703]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:06:52.703 --> 00:06:54.626]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[00:06:59.844 --> 00:07:04.808]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:07:04.808 --> 00:07:05.808]  What have we got?
[00:07:05.808 --> 00:07:08.250]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:09.271]  A republic.
[00:07:09.271 --> 00:07:11.913]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:07:11.913 --> 00:07:14.175]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:07:14.175 --> 00:07:16.196]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:07:16.196 --> 00:07:17.877]  So they think they own our land?
[00:07:17.877 --> 00:07:19.198]  They think they own our water?
[00:07:19.198 --> 00:07:19.819]  Children?
[00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:20.940]  Our education?
[00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:21.760]  Our money?
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.423]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:07:25.783 --> 00:07:29.447]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:07:29.447 --> 00:07:30.748]  You are being warned.
[00:07:30.748 --> 00:07:31.769]  We have the facts.
[00:07:31.769 --> 00:07:32.930]  We have the Constitution.
[00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:33.831]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:07:33.831 --> 00:07:34.732]  We have common law.
[00:07:34.732 --> 00:07:37.254]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:37.254 --> 00:07:40.197]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[00:07:40.197 --> 00:07:41.018]  Rise of the Republic.
[00:07:41.138 --> 00:07:46.083]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:07:46.083 --> 00:07:47.585]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:07:47.585 --> 00:07:48.666]  Don't tread on me.
[00:07:48.666 --> 00:07:54.752]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:08:10.336 --> 00:08:14.519]  On the march, the empire is on the run.
[00:08:14.519 --> 00:08:22.164]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:22.164 --> 00:08:25.726]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:08:25.726 --> 00:08:27.667]  We are live, 27th day of July, 2010.
[00:08:33.424 --> 00:08:36.247]  Let's go ahead and get into the top stories.
[00:08:36.247 --> 00:08:39.190]  Ahmed Dinejad says he expects the U.S.
[00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.533]  to attack Mideast soon.
[00:08:41.533 --> 00:08:43.735]  He said this in a televised address.
[00:08:43.735 --> 00:08:49.942]  Iran expects the United States to launch a military strike on at least two countries in the Middle East in the next three months.
[00:08:49.942 --> 00:08:53.386]  Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told state-run Press TV.
[00:08:54.207 --> 00:09:03.538]  In an interview recorded on Monday, Ahmadinejad did not specify whether he thought Iran itself would be attacked, nor did he say what intelligence led him to expect such a move.
[00:09:03.538 --> 00:09:08.363]  Well, maybe it's the former CIA director Hayden saying that they're going to attack.
[00:09:08.363 --> 00:09:10.705]  Maybe it's the Israeli leader.
[00:09:12.796 --> 00:09:15.018]  Benjamin Netanyahu coming out and saying that.
[00:09:15.018 --> 00:09:21.924]  Maybe it's the fact that that's been all over U.S., British, and European newspapers in the last month, and U.S.
[00:09:21.924 --> 00:09:31.072]  aircraft carriers and other fleets are massing, and bunker-busting weapons have been publicly moved into Diego Garcia.
[00:09:31.072 --> 00:09:33.995]  Maybe that's why Ahmadinejad thinks that.
[00:09:33.995 --> 00:09:38.679]  And of course, they're also massing troops in and around Venezuela.
[00:09:40.725 --> 00:09:51.229]  The United States and Israel have refused to rule out military action against Iran's nuclear program that they fear could lead to it making a bomb, something Iran denies.
[00:09:51.229 --> 00:10:01.313]  Continuing, they have decided to attack at least two countries in the region in the next three months, Ahmadinejad said in excerpts broadcast on the Rolling News Channel on Tuesday.
[00:10:02.788 --> 00:10:10.212]  Israel, which refuses to confirm or deny the existence of its own nuclear arsenal, has a history of preemptive strikes against suspected nuclear targets.
[00:10:10.212 --> 00:10:17.096]  In 1981, it destroyed Iraq's only nuclear reactor, and in 2007, bombed a suspected site in Syria.
[00:10:17.096 --> 00:10:23.660]  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran the ultimate terrorist threat.
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.642]  His deputy, Mozi Yalan, has said Israel
[00:10:27.162 --> 00:10:35.625]  Has improved military capability, which could be used against its foes in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, or Iran.
[00:10:35.625 --> 00:10:40.347]  So this is extremely serious, what we're dealing with here.
[00:10:40.347 --> 00:10:48.050]  Let's get exactly what the state-run Press TV had to say in their interview with the President of Iran.
[00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:49.011]  Headline, U.S.
[00:10:49.011 --> 00:10:54.293]  Psywar, or Psychwar, plan includes two hot wars, or physical wars.
[00:10:54.833 --> 00:11:01.817]  The Iranian president says the United States and Israel plan to attack two countries in the Middle East as part of a conspiracy to apply pressure on Iran.
[00:11:01.817 --> 00:11:03.138]  We have precise information.
[00:11:03.138 --> 00:11:07.480]  The Americans have devised a plot according to which they seek to launch a psychological war on Iran.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.422]  Ahmadinejad stated in an exclusive interview with Press TV on Monday.
[00:11:11.422 --> 00:11:14.624]  They plan to attack at least two countries in the region within the next three months.
[00:11:14.624 --> 00:11:16.025]  He added, he said the U.S.
[00:11:16.025 --> 00:11:18.606]  seeks to achieve two main objectives with the scheme.
[00:11:18.606 --> 00:11:22.849]  First of all, they want to hamper Iran's progress and development since they are opposed
[00:11:23.189 --> 00:11:23.909]  We're good to go.
[00:11:49.056 --> 00:11:58.787]  Commenting on the nuclear issue, Ahmadinejad said Iran will resume nuclear talks with the West in September, adding that Iran wants Turkey and Brazil to participate in the negotiations.
[00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:02.742]  You notice everything is heating up.
[00:12:02.742 --> 00:12:06.224]  And what did Wayne Madsen say here yesterday?
[00:12:06.224 --> 00:12:08.506]  He thinks there's a good chance they're going to strike in the next three months.
[00:12:08.506 --> 00:12:10.227]  That's what Tarpley's saying.
[00:12:10.227 --> 00:12:13.769]  That's basically what the White House has been alluding to.
[00:12:13.769 --> 00:12:17.452]  And so right now they are preparing to strike Iran.
[00:12:17.452 --> 00:12:20.234]  And the consequences of this run from bad to worse.
[00:12:21.505 --> 00:12:23.587]  But here's Bloomberg's headline.
[00:12:41.499 --> 00:12:47.902]  Legitimately countered their powerful nuclear deterrence, the largest ever nuclear war exercise to be staged by the U.S.
[00:12:47.902 --> 00:12:53.364]  and South Korea puppet forces, the National Defense Council said, according to North Korean Central News Agency.
[00:12:53.364 --> 00:12:58.386]  The maneuvers, which involved 20 vessels and 200 aircraft from the U.S.
[00:12:58.386 --> 00:13:02.568]  and South Korea, pose a threat to the country's sovereignty and security.
[00:13:02.568 --> 00:13:07.310]  Rai Thong-il, an official with North Korea's delegation to the
[00:13:08.507 --> 00:13:08.707]  I think?
[00:13:27.811 --> 00:13:28.311]  U.S.
[00:13:28.311 --> 00:13:34.255]  forces massing in the surrounding areas and in the ocean off their coast.
[00:13:34.255 --> 00:13:45.343]  Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez threatened to cut oil supplies in the United States in case of a military attack from Colombia as the dispute escalated over charges his country harbors Colombian rebels.
[00:13:45.343 --> 00:13:55.990]  A vocal and frequent critic of the United States, Chavez broke off diplomatic relations with Colombia last week over the claims by the outgoing government of President
[00:13:57.083 --> 00:14:01.085]  Alvaro Ubre, a close ally of the United States.
[00:14:01.085 --> 00:14:07.589]  If there was an armed aggression against Venezuela, Chavez said, from Colombian territory or from elsewhere,
[00:14:09.684 --> 00:14:17.454]  Promoted by the Yankee Empire, we would suspend oil shipments to the United States even if we have to eat stones here, he said.
[00:14:17.454 --> 00:14:27.308]  We would not send a drop more, they supply about 25% of our oil, to US refineries, he said, to a roar of approval from thousands of supporters at a rally for his socialist party.
[00:14:29.642 --> 00:14:38.555]  Meanwhile, the new British Prime Minister calls the Gaza Strip a prison camp, and that's gotten angry responses from Israel.
[00:14:38.555 --> 00:14:45.425]  Speaking of oil, BP oil spill cleanup crews can't find crude in the Gulf, as the size of the slush
[00:14:46.764 --> 00:14:47.365]  Shrinks?
[00:14:47.365 --> 00:14:50.370]  Experts say oil is breaking up, staying below the surface.
[00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:52.433]  Well, I mean, why is it breaking up?
[00:14:52.433 --> 00:14:55.258]  Why is it staying below the surface?
[00:14:55.258 --> 00:15:01.068]  Because they've sprayed 40 plus million gallons of different dispersants, like Corexit, on it.
[00:15:03.169 --> 00:15:11.955]  And all of the experts have said this is much worse than just letting the oil float around and even come into shore because it's releasing the methane from the oil.
[00:15:11.955 --> 00:15:14.016]  It's sending it underwater.
[00:15:14.016 --> 00:15:22.301]  It's causing even more devastation to the Gulf ecosystem and is creating giant dead zones.
[00:15:22.301 --> 00:15:24.723]  So that's the news on that front.
[00:15:24.723 --> 00:15:26.484]  And it's clear now.
[00:15:26.484 --> 00:15:27.345]  It's all over the news.
[00:15:27.345 --> 00:15:28.906]  We reported this a week and a half ago.
[00:15:30.086 --> 00:15:48.056]  That there are giant oil leaks in and around in a several mile area of the original well that they claim they capped a week and a half ago and that it simply caused other ruptures deeper down in the ground beneath the surface and that it's coming out in other areas.
[00:15:48.056 --> 00:15:57.262]  And so there's a big cover up there with the government BP trying to claim that everything is fixed and that there's other oil wells nearby that are leaking massive amounts of oil.
[00:15:57.802 --> 00:16:03.150]  Though there are no oil wells in that two-mile area where there are multiple fissures leaking.
[00:16:09.744 --> 00:16:27.550]  Having the war drums being beaten louder and louder with more intensity, the sabers not just being rattled but clearly out of their scabbards with Iran, with Venezuela, with Syria, Lebanon, and other areas, and why the globalists are wanting to move towards war.
[00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:31.031]  And it's not because they want to stop Iran from supposedly getting a nuclear weapon.
[00:16:31.031 --> 00:16:33.732]  The CIA admits they're nowhere near getting it.
[00:16:33.732 --> 00:16:35.233]  They even tried to have Western countries
[00:16:36.253 --> 00:16:46.402]  Like France and Turkey and then even Brazil to take all their uranium under UN inspection and refine it to a level nowhere near what they need for weapons because they do want to have their own power supply.
[00:16:46.402 --> 00:16:47.983]  People then say, well they have lots of oil.
[00:16:47.983 --> 00:16:56.190]  They only have half the refining capacity roughly they need and import about half their gasoline and diesel and that's on record and the West wants to have war with them.
[00:16:57.028 --> 00:17:03.012]  Five years ago, they had a soft line leader, and the UN had said that no one had ever allowed inspections to this level.
[00:17:03.012 --> 00:17:04.454]  They totally rolled over.
[00:17:04.454 --> 00:17:07.456]  And then the West said, well, now you can't even have peaceful reactors.
[00:17:07.456 --> 00:17:11.599]  And so then a hardliner, Ahmadinejad, got put into power.
[00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:13.200]  I mean, that's the facts.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.963]  And, well, I'm going to cover it coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:17:16.963 --> 00:17:19.805]  I want to get to some other important news.
[00:17:19.805 --> 00:17:22.547]  Before then, I also want to open the phones up.
[00:17:22.547 --> 00:17:22.607]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:17:27.776 --> 00:17:34.057]  Wide open phones, and I would hope that you would want to at least comment on any of the stories that I have raised here today.
[00:17:34.057 --> 00:17:38.498]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:17:38.498 --> 00:17:53.301]  Coming up, later in the next hour, I want to get into a caller to the show yesterday, and that short seven-minute discussion is posted at the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube, also the entire show at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:17:58.393 --> 00:18:15.088]  He called in and said, I was in Iraq, I just came back in the last few months and there were Austin SWAT team there training for basically martial law, that was his words, and for setting up checkpoints, searching everybody's cars, and doing door-to-door gun confiscation.
[00:18:15.088 --> 00:18:19.452]  And about a third of the commenters or so were saying he was a liar.
[00:18:19.452 --> 00:18:23.035]  Well, I did a simple search engine search of Austin
[00:18:24.042 --> 00:18:30.407]  Police Iraq or Austin SWAT Iraq and found a bunch of mainstream news articles.
[00:18:30.407 --> 00:18:35.030]  The first link is the Fort Hood Sentinel from March 11th.
[00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:42.115]  And it said that the Austin SWAT team commander and others had just returned from Iraq.
[00:18:42.115 --> 00:18:44.157]  So and it's got photos of them.
[00:18:44.157 --> 00:18:51.462]  So that's the main newspaper at Fort Hood and in the surrounding area there in Killeen.
[00:18:51.462 --> 00:18:52.964]  So it's a fact.
[00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:54.501]  Okay?
[00:18:54.501 --> 00:18:56.062]  SWAT team's interviewed, it's real.
[00:18:56.062 --> 00:18:57.944]  Okay?
[00:18:57.944 --> 00:19:02.408]  Just like I get emails all the time, and, oh, you're lying about Marines running checkpoints.
[00:19:02.408 --> 00:19:17.943]  And I don't even bother to send them articles out of Tennessee mainstream news, or articles out of California mainstream news, or articles out of Kentucky or Alabama, with them at checkpoints searching people, photos in the newspaper, newscasts showing it, because they don't want to know.
[00:19:18.735 --> 00:19:21.378]  They want us, and most of them aren't government agents.
[00:19:21.378 --> 00:19:22.740]  That's what's sad.
[00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:28.507]  They're just citizens who've got their heads so deep in the sand that they may never pull them out.
[00:19:28.507 --> 00:19:30.149]  But you know what?
[00:19:30.149 --> 00:19:35.656]  We don't need those timid souls who want to live in denial and believe the lie.
[00:19:37.247 --> 00:19:43.771]  What we need is people who will face the facts and understand history and look at what's happening to us.
[00:19:43.771 --> 00:19:47.173]  I want to come back and give you the latest developments dealing with WikiLeaks.
[00:19:47.173 --> 00:19:57.099]  The picture is really coming into clear focus now of what's really going on with this release of data and I'm now able to more authoritatively give you my take on it.
[00:19:57.099 --> 00:19:59.581]  I've now completed my first wave of analyzing it.
[00:20:00.876 --> 00:20:02.637]  Normal blood pressure, naturally.
[00:20:02.637 --> 00:20:03.758]  How would that make you feel?
[00:20:03.758 --> 00:20:06.019]  Don reports dramatic improvements with heart
[00:20:19.108 --> 00:20:25.332]  I started taking Hardened Body Extract and from within a few days I started sleeping a lot better.
[00:20:25.332 --> 00:20:30.415]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[00:20:47.086 --> 00:20:48.168]  I did not expect this at all.
[00:20:48.168 --> 00:20:52.875]  By the 7th, 8th, and 9th day, I saw dramatic improvements from taking Hardened Body Extract.
[00:20:52.875 --> 00:20:56.179]  Details at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305 for Hardened Body Extract.
[00:21:04.797 --> 00:21:06.059]  Tyranny is here.
[00:21:06.059 --> 00:21:09.822]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:21:09.822 --> 00:21:12.245]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:21:12.245 --> 00:21:18.111]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:21:18.111 --> 00:21:24.357]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:21:24.757 --> 00:21:30.741]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:21:30.741 --> 00:21:34.904]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:21:34.904 --> 00:21:39.207]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:21:39.207 --> 00:21:45.152]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:21:45.152 --> 00:21:48.714]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:21:48.714 --> 00:21:50.695]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:21:50.695 --> 00:21:51.136]  It's here.

[00:24:12.999 --> 00:24:18.202]  Thank you for joining us on this Tuesday edition.
[00:24:18.202 --> 00:24:30.387]  Coming up in the next segment, Federal News Radio 1500 AM has run a story about defense can't account for 8.7 billion.
[00:24:30.387 --> 00:24:32.068]  This is a complete whitewash.
[00:24:32.068 --> 00:24:35.790]  I just search engine the term 2.3 trillion missing.
[00:24:36.958 --> 00:24:46.200]  That's $2,300,000,000,000 and pulled up CBS, Associated Press and others from September 10th, 2001.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:25:02.902]  Now, by hearings in 2004 that we posted clips of from C-SPAN and played here on air, it was over $4,000,000,000 missing and we have clips of Rumsfeld saying, I won't tell you where it went, we don't know.
[00:25:02.902 --> 00:25:06.083]  That was in those famous exchanges with former Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney.
[00:25:08.717 --> 00:25:10.098]  I'm surprised she's still breathing.
[00:25:10.098 --> 00:25:11.078]  She has a lot of courage.
[00:25:11.078 --> 00:25:15.280]  I may disagree with her on a lot of issues, but I admire her courage.
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:19.402]  So that is coming up in the next segment.
[00:25:19.402 --> 00:25:34.069]  I've really had some time to research WikiLeaks over the last year or so, and I think they've done good work releasing the footage from three years ago of the gunships, the Apaches, killing Reuters reporters and shooting children and laughing about it.
[00:25:35.609 --> 00:25:47.139]  They have indicted the Army private who they think leaked that information and that concerns me about how they protect their sources.
[00:25:47.139 --> 00:25:51.923]  They have released 92,000 documents, over 92,000 documents.
[00:25:51.923 --> 00:25:57.288]  This time they gave it to Der Spiegel, The Guardian and the New York Times.
[00:25:57.288 --> 00:26:02.152]  It's the biggest news story of the week and the media is spinning it.
[00:26:02.152 --> 00:26:03.113]  Instead of talking
[00:26:05.094 --> 00:26:07.815]  about what's in the documents.
[00:26:07.815 --> 00:26:10.456]  The media is talking about should the documents have been released.
[00:26:10.456 --> 00:26:12.317]  That's how they're spinning this.
[00:26:12.317 --> 00:26:17.459]  But I'm more concerned about what the media is focusing in on in these documents.
[00:26:17.459 --> 00:26:23.022]  Now, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is saying more revelations are to come.
[00:26:23.022 --> 00:26:29.505]  Whistleblowing site WikiLeaks says it has a backlog of further secret material after publication of Afghanistan war logs.
[00:26:31.013 --> 00:26:36.460]  Exactly what our guests said yesterday, both John Young and Wayne Madsen.
[00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:38.102]  They said this is not really top secret.
[00:26:38.102 --> 00:26:39.724]  This is at best secret.
[00:26:39.724 --> 00:26:47.854]  These are mid-level battlefield communiques being sent by mid-level Army officers to the State Department and the CIA.
[00:26:49.349 --> 00:26:51.630]  As well as the Defense Department.
[00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:54.672]  And these are famously filled with propaganda.
[00:26:54.672 --> 00:26:59.836]  Fake body counts, fake atrocity reports about the enemy.
[00:26:59.836 --> 00:27:10.463]  And government loves to have these reports, then cull through them, decide what they're going to leak to a source like Assange, who may be a good guy, probably is.
[00:27:10.463 --> 00:27:14.285]  And then the media can focus in on what they want to, to paint a picture.
[00:27:14.285 --> 00:27:14.966]  And they've done that.
[00:27:14.966 --> 00:27:16.967]  They're saying Pakistan's working with the Taliban.
[00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:24.434]  But Steve Watson has written a detailed report, so has Kurt Nemo, both at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com that they posted last night.
[00:27:24.434 --> 00:27:34.941]  Two different reports going over the history of it being on record that the CIA and Defense Department, since 79 and right through to today, have been funding Pakistani ISI.
[00:27:34.941 --> 00:27:37.603]  They're trying to blame General Hamid Gul right now.
[00:27:39.608 --> 00:27:42.971]  By the way, he contacted us two years ago and gave us an exclusive interview.
[00:27:42.971 --> 00:27:47.254]  That was bizarre.
[00:27:47.254 --> 00:27:50.077]  From Islamabad in Pakistan.
[00:27:50.077 --> 00:27:55.982]  And he at the time on my show said, I'm coming out because I'm not going to be blamed for the attack on Mumbai.
[00:27:55.982 --> 00:27:59.345]  This was the CIA, Mossad and British intelligence.
[00:27:59.345 --> 00:28:04.809]  And what came out in the Chicago Tribune a few months ago and other papers headlined, U.S.
[00:28:04.809 --> 00:28:05.650]  government agent
[00:28:08.632 --> 00:28:10.633]  was a leader of Mumbai attack.
[00:28:10.633 --> 00:28:15.535]  Well, that's what the head of Indian intelligence said the day of the attack.
[00:28:15.535 --> 00:28:23.018]  While it was going on, he told the press, I've got to go in there and, you know, run my commando raid against these people.
[00:28:23.018 --> 00:28:29.880]  But they've infiltrated Indian intelligence, and this was a Western operation.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.081]  And by the way, he was not a Muslim.
[00:28:31.937 --> 00:28:36.700]  Well, he was a Hindu from memory, but you can go look it up, so he wasn't like some Muslim, you know, lying.
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:38.481]  And he was killed that day.
[00:28:38.481 --> 00:28:39.742]  You notice.
[00:28:39.742 --> 00:28:45.066]  The head of Indian intelligence led the raids against him, and he was killed.
[00:28:45.879 --> 00:28:51.001]  Remember Mumbai, them attacking the shopping mall, and it was guys running around out of their minds.
[00:28:51.001 --> 00:28:58.103]  I saw a video of them, and they looked like they were completely insane, and they weren't wearing turbans, they didn't have beards.
[00:28:58.103 --> 00:29:05.146]  And I said they looked like they were on drugs, and then it came out in the Associated Press they were on LSD, PCP, peyote, and other drugs.
[00:29:05.146 --> 00:29:07.867]  They just shot some lunatics up, sent them out.
[00:29:08.707 --> 00:29:10.590]  The point is, it came out that was true.
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:27.521]  This is what the globalists do.
[00:29:27.521 --> 00:29:30.424]  They go shoot up a school or a church or a shopping mall.
[00:29:30.424 --> 00:29:33.647]  They kill a few of the supposed people they're going to blame.
[00:29:33.647 --> 00:29:39.693]  They usually hang one patsy out to dry, like Lee Harvey Oswald or Tim McVeigh.
[00:29:39.693 --> 00:29:43.416]  And, I mean, it came out this was the case, but we'll continue with WikiLeaks.
[00:29:43.416 --> 00:29:47.660]  Then I'll get into the missing trillions, not the missing 8.7 billion.
[00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:48.921]  That's a whitewash, red herring.
[00:29:48.921 --> 00:29:49.322]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.953 --> 00:29:54.881]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[00:31:52.498 --> 00:31:53.319]  Thank you!
[00:31:59.599 --> 00:32:04.162]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:04.162 --> 00:32:05.063]  Number 1.
[00:32:05.063 --> 00:32:08.506]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:08.506 --> 00:32:09.366]  Number 2.
[00:32:09.366 --> 00:32:14.250]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:15.010]  It's true.
[00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:19.874]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:19.874 --> 00:32:20.695]  Number 3.
[00:32:20.695 --> 00:32:24.277]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:24.277 --> 00:32:27.980]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:28.981]  Number 4.
[00:32:28.981 --> 00:32:31.743]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:31.743 --> 00:32:35.427]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:35.427 --> 00:32:36.208]  Number 5.
[00:32:36.208 --> 00:32:40.351]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:40.351 --> 00:32:45.116]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:45.396 --> 00:32:49.580]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:51.362]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:51.362 --> 00:32:53.604]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:32:53.604 --> 00:32:56.246]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:32:56.246 --> 00:33:07.077]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:15.382 --> 00:33:29.567]  I'm going to continue getting into the latest developments with WikiLeaks and what I think is really going on here from a historical perspective, and I do smell something rotten in the state of WikiLeaks.
[00:33:29.567 --> 00:33:34.649]  That doesn't mean the people involved in it are bad, but they're clearly being used, that's evident.
[00:33:34.649 --> 00:33:43.332]  Bare minimum, the system is spinning the information that was released and it appears to be disinfo being fed out to them.
[00:33:44.278 --> 00:33:46.379]  But that's coming up in a moment.
[00:33:46.379 --> 00:33:54.083]  Then I'm going to get into the situation with the trillions and trillions that have been stolen by the Pentagon and their contractors on record.
[00:33:54.083 --> 00:33:59.526]  You won't be hearing this from Alex Jones, you'll hear it from Donald Rumsfeld coming up here in a few minutes.
[00:33:59.526 --> 00:34:04.168]  And this is one of the big forgotten stories that has just reared its head again.
[00:34:04.168 --> 00:34:08.150]  One of the top links on Drudge today is defense can't account for $8.7 billion.
[00:34:11.001 --> 00:34:26.773]  Well, I'm going to have Kurt or Steve Watson write an article about this, and hopefully Drudge will link to it, saying it's trillions that are missing, not just 8.7 billion, and break down the history of that and just how corrupt this is.
[00:34:26.773 --> 00:34:38.062]  Some of the worst corporate welfare that we have in this nation, what's bankrupting this country, not just the banks that own the military industrial complex with their derivatives, but also
[00:34:39.653 --> 00:34:49.302]  The trillions and trillions spent every year on budget, the trillions stolen every year off budget, and how they do that, and how the military-industrial complex has taken our society over.
[00:34:49.302 --> 00:34:52.084]  And of course, that was President Eisenhower that warned us about that.
[00:34:52.084 --> 00:34:59.711]  But what doesn't get as much attention is in his 45-minute farewell address speech on January 17, 1961.
[00:35:03.658 --> 00:35:09.641]  Is where he talks about a technocratic, technological elite taking over society.
[00:35:09.641 --> 00:35:12.182]  So that is coming up as well.
[00:35:12.182 --> 00:35:21.187]  But before I go any further, we're going to get rid of this special by next Monday, so I would encourage you to take advantage of it if you really want a tool to wake people up.
[00:35:21.187 --> 00:35:26.429]  You know the Obama deception has been censored quite a bit, and they've attempted to keep the public from seeing it.
[00:35:26.429 --> 00:35:28.790]  You can get four copies of the Obama deception for $19.95.
[00:35:30.171 --> 00:35:33.692]  So that's a little less than $5 a piece until next Monday.
[00:35:33.692 --> 00:35:37.154]  We're going to take it down off of the shopping cart next Monday.
[00:35:37.154 --> 00:35:39.575]  And of course, part two of it is Fall of the Republic.
[00:35:39.575 --> 00:35:41.436]  We have big discounts on the films.
[00:35:41.436 --> 00:35:51.920]  We have a lot of other combos and specials where you buy a t-shirt and you get a ball cap free or you buy one film and another film free or you get Jesse Ventura's book, American Conspiracies.
[00:35:53.166 --> 00:35:53.566]  We're good to go.
[00:36:13.868 --> 00:36:16.949]  But the economy, as you know, is falling apart and revenue has gone down.
[00:36:16.949 --> 00:36:25.812]  So anybody who wants to support us, also buy the books, the videos, the t-shirts, the materials at InfoWars.com because I need to raise the capital to finish out the studio.
[00:36:25.812 --> 00:36:27.993]  I'll soon be giving you a tour of that.
[00:36:27.993 --> 00:36:31.354]  We've built the new structure, filled out the warehouse next door.
[00:36:31.994 --> 00:36:32.194]  I think?
[00:36:47.722 --> 00:36:49.763]  We are putting out the call.
[00:36:49.763 --> 00:36:52.963]  If you want us to continue what we're doing and expand it, we need your help.
[00:36:52.963 --> 00:36:54.404]  So buy the books, the videos, the materials.
[00:36:54.404 --> 00:36:59.205]  If you want to just write to us and send us a donation, that is always appreciated.
[00:36:59.205 --> 00:36:59.625]  It's P.O.
[00:36:59.625 --> 00:37:00.486]  Box 19549 Austin, TX 78760.
[00:37:00.486 --> 00:37:01.006]  That's P.O.
[00:37:01.006 --> 00:37:02.006]  Box 19549 Austin, TX 78760.
[00:37:09.468 --> 00:37:13.051]  And there's also a donation button on InfoWars, but it's hidden somewhere.
[00:37:13.051 --> 00:37:17.674]  I'm going to ask Kurt Nemo to make that a banner at the bottom of the site today.
[00:37:17.674 --> 00:37:26.580]  If you call Kurt and have him put a link to our PayPal donate button at the bottom, you know, donate to the InfoWars, because a lot of people tell me, you know, put a donate button up.
[00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:27.861]  We want to support you.
[00:37:27.861 --> 00:37:30.883]  Well, that's how you can do it and also support our sponsors.
[00:37:30.883 --> 00:37:38.089]  There's also some other persecution we've been going through that's very intense, but I've not decided whether I want to go public with it at this time.
[00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:41.911]  Uh, but it's extremely expensive and time consuming.
[00:37:41.911 --> 00:37:45.514]  Uh, and I'm not going to let anything get in the way of our mission.
[00:37:45.514 --> 00:37:55.141]  So I'm deciding whether to go completely ape and publicly expose how we're being persecuted or whether that'll be used as a distraction.
[00:37:55.141 --> 00:37:58.784]  It's been linked directly to Obama and Michelle Obama.
[00:37:58.784 --> 00:38:01.146]  And I'll tell you in the shower this morning, I actually started.
[00:38:02.003 --> 00:38:05.606]  Shaking and it it wasn't a shaking of fear.
[00:38:05.606 --> 00:38:30.184]  It was it was shaking and trembling of my nervous system my brain Recognizing that this is only the beginning of the persecution and the beginning of what I've got to go through and It's a sign of our success and I thank God for it But I'm just gonna leave it at that III I'm having to in the last week really I
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:38.864]  Cogitate and think about this, and I'll make my decision by next week.
[00:38:38.864 --> 00:38:42.867]  I have a tendency to procrastinate because I'm doing so many other projects.
[00:38:42.867 --> 00:38:49.972]  Just like I've been procrastinating about even doing the tour of the new studio.
[00:38:49.972 --> 00:38:52.574]  And I'm not complaining, I just can't do it all.
[00:38:52.574 --> 00:38:55.116]  There's so many special emergency videos I want to put out.
[00:38:55.116 --> 00:38:59.759]  There's a film I'm trying to make that is just so time consuming because I won't put out Crud.
[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:04.923]  And I just, you know, that old saying of, I wish I could give more.
[00:39:04.923 --> 00:39:06.325]  I'm not complaining.
[00:39:06.325 --> 00:39:07.646]  I'm complaining about myself.
[00:39:07.646 --> 00:39:09.028]  I just can't do it all.
[00:39:09.028 --> 00:39:09.749]  And I'm weak.
[00:39:09.749 --> 00:39:13.653]  And I was thinking about how weak my flesh is this morning.
[00:39:13.653 --> 00:39:18.758]  And how I'm trying to be more professional and more focused and more serious.
[00:39:18.758 --> 00:39:19.980]  And we're all human.
[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:20.741]  None of us are perfect.
[00:39:22.776 --> 00:39:25.297]  It's just really hit me how real all of this is.
[00:39:25.297 --> 00:39:29.799]  And I've always known it's real, but it's one thing to know it intellectually.
[00:39:29.799 --> 00:39:42.243]  It's another thing to experience it and to experience the death threats and the COINTELPRO and the media attacks and the lies and the dirty tricks and the other things.
[00:39:42.243 --> 00:39:47.865]  And to know I'm on the White House enemies list a year ago, that's been in the news.
[00:39:47.865 --> 00:39:48.226]  I'm number 13.
[00:39:50.029 --> 00:39:58.232]  To know I'm on the ADL, Southern Primary Law Center enemies list.
[00:39:58.232 --> 00:39:59.912]  And to know that we're right about all of this.
[00:39:59.912 --> 00:40:01.893]  I mean, we understand what's happened.
[00:40:01.893 --> 00:40:03.493]  I wish every day I was wrong.
[00:40:03.493 --> 00:40:04.414]  I wish every day...
[00:40:05.609 --> 00:40:12.813]  But then when I hear my show rebroadcast, or I watch a video we've made, I get mad at myself because it's worse than what I can even present!
[00:40:12.813 --> 00:40:33.903]  I cannot... The whole spectrum of society, and life, and government, and corporations, and the new evils, and corruptions that are invented by these people, as my knowledge grows, I realize how fathomless, how deep these chasms, or these bottomless pits of wickedness are that
[00:40:42.386 --> 00:40:49.209]  I guess the overwhelming thought, what's in my spirit is, why does it have to be this way?
[00:40:49.209 --> 00:40:51.931]  Why can't I wake up more police and military?
[00:40:51.931 --> 00:40:54.252]  Why aren't I effective enough?
[00:40:54.252 --> 00:40:59.575]  Why if I can see the truth and know it and have studied history and have all the government documents admitting
[00:41:00.575 --> 00:41:04.018]  To all of this and all the lies and corruption that have been proven.
[00:41:04.018 --> 00:41:06.120]  And we know where this road leads.
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:07.761]  We know where tyranny goes.
[00:41:07.761 --> 00:41:09.743]  We know this is tyranny.
[00:41:09.743 --> 00:41:12.325]  And it's so horrible for all of us.
[00:41:12.325 --> 00:41:27.339]  And they get all these government and corporate minions who are compartmentalized and on power trips and feel like they're part of the winning team to just do things that are fundamentally wrong and fundamentally corrupt and fundamentally toxic.
[00:41:28.342 --> 00:41:35.606]  But I've always likened it to cancer cells.
[00:41:35.606 --> 00:41:41.310]  If cancer was conscious, not saying it is, but if malfunctioning cells
[00:41:47.145 --> 00:41:47.746]  We're good to go.
[00:42:06.897 --> 00:42:08.257]  And boy, I'm winning.
[00:42:08.257 --> 00:42:09.938]  Man, I'm doing a great job.
[00:42:09.938 --> 00:42:11.838]  Look, nothing can stop us.
[00:42:11.838 --> 00:42:13.319]  Because you break the rules.
[00:42:13.319 --> 00:42:14.579]  Because you're ruthless.
[00:42:14.579 --> 00:42:15.940]  Because you're corrupt.
[00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:18.600]  Because you're not following God's code.
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.501]  You're not following common sense.
[00:42:20.501 --> 00:42:22.221]  You're not following goodness.
[00:42:22.221 --> 00:42:26.202]  You think it's tough to be wicked.
[00:42:26.202 --> 00:42:29.043]  You're in a form of arrested development.
[00:42:29.043 --> 00:42:31.064]  You're childlike.
[00:42:31.064 --> 00:42:35.505]  So many of these evil people are wicked and have a taste for blood and oppression and dominance.
[00:42:37.398 --> 00:42:41.161]  But at the same time, they're very arrested.
[00:42:41.161 --> 00:43:01.360]  And if they could see what I see, if they could know history, if they could have experienced, if I could somehow reach out to them, through all their programming and brainwashing, we could turn the tide against this.
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:02.681]  And now look how far we've come.
[00:43:07.912 --> 00:43:13.654]  Now look how far we've come, and I know that we can defeat this.
[00:43:13.654 --> 00:43:30.298]  And I also know that the Bible has been manipulated the way it's interpreted, and that everybody's been taught, going back hundreds of years, to lay down to corrupt empires, to lay down to corrupt armies, to lay down to corrupt governments, thinking it's the end of the world and it's God's will.
[00:43:30.298 --> 00:43:35.840]  When the Bible clearly states it's God's will that whether you're gonna lose, win, or draw, you are being tested
[00:43:37.392 --> 00:43:51.645]  In this one life to live, in this earth suit that we all inhabit, that our spirits inhabit, we are being tested and that it doesn't matter whether we even have a chance of winning, which we do, that we've got to stand up to evil.
[00:43:51.645 --> 00:43:59.252]  And it's like Jonah going to Nineveh and Nineveh getting a hundred year reprieve.
[00:43:59.252 --> 00:44:03.736]  The only way evil is allowed to get away with what it's doing and to spread like a cancer
[00:44:06.258 --> 00:44:24.496]  Is by you being disempowered and sitting on the bench and not being the empowered, incredible creature you are, living on a gorgeous planet that is just a total blessing, infused with the life force of the universe, given to it by the Creator.
[00:44:25.598 --> 00:44:27.660]  I mean, what is there outside the universe?
[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:29.061]  What made life?
[00:44:29.061 --> 00:44:34.265]  What created the planets and the solar system and the galaxies and black holes?
[00:44:34.265 --> 00:44:35.486]  What is there?
[00:44:35.486 --> 00:44:48.778]  I mean, if you don't realize that there is something larger than just this narrow perception that we're able to see, smell, and touch, and taste, you're blind.
[00:44:49.935 --> 00:44:51.477]  Spiritually blind.
[00:44:51.477 --> 00:44:53.579]  And I don't want you to be blind.
[00:44:53.579 --> 00:45:02.707]  I have empathy for dumbed-down, brainwashed SWAT team people that are being bathed in evil and being twisted to the dark side.
[00:45:02.707 --> 00:45:07.672]  I have empathy for the unconscious people serving the New World Order.
[00:45:09.195 --> 00:45:09.555]  I don't want
[00:45:32.739 --> 00:45:35.521]  I don't want you to lose your destiny.
[00:45:35.521 --> 00:45:40.105]  I don't want you to lose knowing the truth and being empowered.
[00:45:40.105 --> 00:45:42.567]  I don't want you to lose your soul.
[00:45:42.567 --> 00:45:45.048]  The globalists believe they traffic in your soul.
[00:45:45.048 --> 00:45:46.710]  They believe in the occult.
[00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:55.637]  They are occultists.
[00:45:55.637 --> 00:45:57.878]  You know what success means for me though?
[00:45:57.878 --> 00:46:00.180]  Success means greater danger.
[00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:02.522]  Success means greater responsibility.
[00:46:06.926 --> 00:46:15.732]  And this morning in the shower, it was a shudder went through me.
[00:46:15.732 --> 00:46:21.276]  I just felt it at a spiritual level passing another threshold, another line.
[00:46:21.276 --> 00:46:31.644]  You know, that message, my psyche telling me, if you don't pull out now, if you don't stop now, if you don't drift off into the sunset now,
[00:46:32.768 --> 00:46:36.973]  You are entering a whole nother level of danger.
[00:46:36.973 --> 00:46:39.116]  You are having an effect.
[00:46:39.116 --> 00:46:43.522]  You have extreme power, like all of you have.
[00:46:43.522 --> 00:46:47.647]  I'm here to have you recognize the power you've got, innate in you, through God.
[00:46:53.032 --> 00:46:55.233]  And this happens every few years.
[00:46:55.233 --> 00:47:09.963]  I feel myself pass another threshold, another circle that I've gone through, closer to the top of the pyramid in realization and understanding.
[00:47:09.963 --> 00:47:12.125]  And it makes me shudder for the responsibility.
[00:47:12.125 --> 00:47:18.429]  It makes me shudder for the danger, not just to myself, but to my little ones and my wife.
[00:47:20.126 --> 00:47:33.799]  And of course I made the conscious and spiritual decision to not grudgingly step across that next line, that next threshold, but to do it with all my will and supplication before the creator of the universe.
[00:47:33.799 --> 00:47:36.922]  And I simply said to God in that shower a few hours ago,
[00:47:37.603 --> 00:47:52.613]  I said, God, I am weak, and I am a sinner, and I am dirty rags, and you know it, but if this is your will, empower me to do what I have to do, and wherever the road leads, I am ready!
[00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:57.413]  As God was telling me, then you are probably going to be killed.
[00:47:57.413 --> 00:47:59.255]  Is this what you want?
[00:47:59.255 --> 00:48:00.276]  Is this what you want?
[00:48:00.276 --> 00:48:02.157]  And I say, yes!
[00:48:02.157 --> 00:48:03.778]  I say, yes!
[00:48:03.778 --> 00:48:05.040]  I am committed!
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:06.361]  I am going all the way!
[00:48:06.361 --> 00:48:08.442]  I will not serve evil!
[00:48:08.442 --> 00:48:10.064]  I will not go along!
[00:48:10.064 --> 00:48:13.406]  I will not be involved in half measures!
[00:48:13.406 --> 00:48:17.470]  I will stand up for the weak and the innocent that are being enslaved and destroyed.
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:36.873]  But all I ask is God to help remove the thorn in my side, the flesh, to take as much of it away as God can, because the evil Alex Jones cannot go down this road.
[00:48:36.873 --> 00:48:41.237]  And every one of you is evil too, and you know it.
[00:48:41.237 --> 00:48:42.157]  And the first step
[00:48:42.998 --> 00:48:47.719]  Towards sanctification is admitting that you are evil!
[00:48:47.719 --> 00:48:49.760]  And that you have problems!
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:52.121]  And that you are sick!
[00:48:52.121 --> 00:48:57.142]  Because if you can't recognize the bad in yourself, you're not going to recognize the good and reach for it.
[00:48:57.142 --> 00:49:04.264]  And I didn't mean to start preaching here today.
[00:49:04.264 --> 00:49:06.385]  But we are on the verge of World War III.
[00:49:06.385 --> 00:49:08.866]  We are on the verge of a total collapsed oppression.
[00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:18.221]  And if we stand up and speak out and get our heads screwed on straight and face the facts of what we are in, we have a chance at a reprieve.
[00:49:18.221 --> 00:49:30.224]  But I'll tell you, the slack-jawed, weak, decadent population that I see out there are like sheep being fed to wolves.
[00:49:30.224 --> 00:49:31.644]  Blind sheep.
[00:49:31.644 --> 00:49:33.704]  Legless sheep.
[00:49:33.704 --> 00:49:36.565]  The New World Order wants to kill you, Debtor, in a hammer.
[00:49:36.565 --> 00:49:38.205]  They want full-spectrum dominance.
[00:49:39.209 --> 00:49:41.791]  They want to wipe you out.
[00:49:41.791 --> 00:49:45.994]  They don't want to just brainwash you or dominate you or use you as a slave.
[00:49:45.994 --> 00:49:48.836]  They don't need you with robotics and technology.
[00:49:48.836 --> 00:49:51.137]  They think this is their planet.
[00:49:51.137 --> 00:49:57.182]  They're here to kill, steal, and destroy, and you better get that through your heads out there.
[00:49:57.182 --> 00:49:58.423]  This is a gut check.
[00:49:58.423 --> 00:49:59.643]  This is real.
[00:49:59.643 --> 00:50:04.967]  And every one of you out there is in just as much danger as I am, and that's the mind trick.
[00:50:04.967 --> 00:50:07.229]  I realized, through discernment,
[00:50:08.322 --> 00:50:09.963]  That it's all a trick.
[00:50:09.963 --> 00:50:19.786]  Once you decide to commit and go past the fear, once you decide to commit and to try to be as pure as you can and to ask God to help you, you realize you were always in danger.
[00:50:19.786 --> 00:50:25.008]  And you were in the greatest danger of losing your eternal soul.
[00:50:25.008 --> 00:50:28.109]  What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul?
[00:50:28.109 --> 00:50:29.070]  Would you sell out?
[00:50:29.070 --> 00:50:31.450]  Would you take a billion dollars for your eyes?
[00:50:31.450 --> 00:50:33.831]  Would you take a billion dollars for your life?
[00:50:33.831 --> 00:50:35.252]  Would you take a billion dollars for your soul?
[00:50:38.567 --> 00:50:41.609]  You know you've got a spirit.
[00:50:41.609 --> 00:50:42.690]  It's written on you.
[00:50:42.690 --> 00:50:43.911]  You know it.
[00:50:43.911 --> 00:50:46.293]  And you know this planet is a test.
[00:50:46.293 --> 00:50:51.697]  You understand that fundamentally.
[00:50:51.697 --> 00:50:55.560]  And so, all you've got to do is make the decision to open your eyes.
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:56.420]  That's all you've got to do.
[00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:57.101]  And you'll see it.
[00:50:57.101 --> 00:50:58.602]  It's all around you.
[00:50:58.602 --> 00:50:59.663]  Make that decision today.
[00:51:03.086 --> 00:51:04.307]  This is not a drill.
[00:51:04.307 --> 00:51:06.829]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:08.731]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[00:51:08.731 --> 00:51:15.936]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[00:51:15.936 --> 00:51:20.340]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:30.608]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[00:51:30.828 --> 00:51:32.468]  Under any circumstance.
[00:51:32.468 --> 00:51:39.690]  These and other closely guarded gun cashing secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:40.370]  But listen up.
[00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:46.631]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[00:51:46.631 --> 00:51:48.472]  Go to HideYourGuns.com.
[00:51:48.472 --> 00:51:50.632]  That's HideYourGuns.com.
[00:51:50.632 --> 00:51:51.132]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:51:51.132 --> 00:51:53.013]  Before they come for your guns.
[00:51:53.013 --> 00:51:53.633]  HideYourGuns.com.
[00:51:53.633 --> 00:51:54.213]  Right now.
[00:52:00.953 --> 00:52:05.917]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:52:05.917 --> 00:52:06.897]  What have we got?
[00:52:06.897 --> 00:52:09.359]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:52:09.359 --> 00:52:10.360]  A republic.
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:13.002]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:52:13.002 --> 00:52:15.284]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:52:15.284 --> 00:52:17.305]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:52:17.305 --> 00:52:18.986]  So they think they own our land?
[00:52:18.986 --> 00:52:20.307]  They think they own our water?
[00:52:20.307 --> 00:52:20.908]  Children?
[00:52:20.908 --> 00:52:22.029]  Our education?
[00:52:22.029 --> 00:52:22.889]  Our money?
[00:52:22.889 --> 00:52:26.512]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:52:26.872 --> 00:52:31.858]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:52:31.858 --> 00:52:32.879]  We have the facts.
[00:52:32.879 --> 00:52:34.040]  We have the Constitution.
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:34.942]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:52:34.942 --> 00:52:35.823]  We have common law.
[00:52:35.823 --> 00:52:38.366]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:38.366 --> 00:52:42.130]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:47.193]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:52:47.193 --> 00:52:48.694]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:52:48.694 --> 00:52:49.774]  Don't tread on me.
[00:52:49.774 --> 00:52:56.638]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:53:01.397 --> 00:53:06.018]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:54:12.677 --> 00:54:16.959]  You know, I know I said I was going to open the phones up.
[00:54:16.959 --> 00:54:18.079]  And I've got a ton of news to cover.
[00:54:18.079 --> 00:54:18.599]  Let's do this.
[00:54:18.599 --> 00:54:24.021]  Let's run through calls in this segment and the next.
[00:54:24.021 --> 00:54:25.822]  Then I'll finish up with WikiLeaks.
[00:54:41.343 --> 00:54:45.184]  The Trillions messing up the Defense Department.
[00:54:45.184 --> 00:54:48.145]  Open announcements that they're planning to strike Iran.
[00:54:48.145 --> 00:54:49.066]  It's all coming up.
[00:54:49.066 --> 00:54:53.107]  And I want to get into the fact that they're training police departments for martial law around the country.
[00:54:53.107 --> 00:54:55.468]  That's confirmed.
[00:54:55.468 --> 00:54:56.789]  Let's go to Bryce in Missouri.
[00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:57.669]  You're on the air, Bryce.
[00:54:59.311 --> 00:55:01.032]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:55:01.032 --> 00:55:02.473]  You bet.
[00:55:02.473 --> 00:55:10.056]  And don't apologize for preaching on the air, man, because I think a lot more people need to hear that type of stuff.
[00:55:10.056 --> 00:55:25.403]  You and I both know that the end of the rabbit hole is Satan, and I don't want to get religious or anything, but I just want to get your take on the solution that we need is Christ in our lives.
[00:55:25.403 --> 00:55:28.384]  And the disease that we all have is sin, as you said.
[00:55:29.714 --> 00:55:36.679]  And uh... we must first change within so that way we can go out there and fight that new world order.
[00:55:36.679 --> 00:55:37.620]  We can't do it alone.
[00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:53.730]  But the reason I covered mainly just the news so people can make their own decisions because the church is so corrupt and so many false teachers that when the average person hears us talking about Christ they think about some hypocrite glitterbug preacher on television.
[00:55:53.730 --> 00:55:54.731]  Right.
[00:55:54.731 --> 00:55:55.211]  Right.
[00:55:55.211 --> 00:55:57.613]  And uh... and so I just wanted to uh...
[00:55:58.329 --> 00:56:01.610]  Thank you for pointing out the truth man.
[00:56:01.610 --> 00:56:04.551]  I mean that's that's what it's about.
[00:56:04.551 --> 00:56:19.297]  Veritas is Veritas and it just comes out of me and I'm just I was talking about my personal relationship and you know it's not you know part of any sect or part of any group it's just my relationship with the Creator and I
[00:56:20.765 --> 00:56:26.532]  The fact that people need to learn to recognize good from evil, and if they can't do that, they have no hope.
[00:56:26.532 --> 00:56:31.878]  I mean, we know what's happening to this society is the opposite of a free society.
[00:56:31.878 --> 00:56:38.807]  We know we're being converted over to a corrupt tyranny by any historical yardstick, and we're in trouble.
[00:56:38.807 --> 00:56:40.309]  And that was the point I was trying to make.
[00:56:41.843 --> 00:56:44.305]  Right, yeah, and I agree with you.
[00:56:44.305 --> 00:56:57.718]  And so, but I really think that, you know, sometimes, you know, because I don't think that if the end of the rabbit hole is Satan, you know, or the evil one or the master of deception, I don't think he really even cares about the elite.
[00:56:57.718 --> 00:57:06.446]  As a matter of fact, if the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, the Illuminati, the Council of 300 or whatever, you know, die away, there's going to be somebody else to take its place.
[00:57:07.006 --> 00:57:10.749]  You know, and this has been going on and on and on over history.
[00:57:10.749 --> 00:57:15.693]  So, yes, we need to stop what's going on now, but people also need to give their life right with God.
[00:57:15.693 --> 00:57:16.894]  What do you think about that?
[00:57:16.894 --> 00:57:18.415]  I agree with you, Bryce.
[00:57:18.415 --> 00:57:20.297]  Let's talk to Roger in Missouri.
[00:57:20.297 --> 00:57:22.458]  Roger, you're on the air.
[00:57:22.458 --> 00:57:23.279]  Hello?
[00:57:23.279 --> 00:57:24.820]  Yes, sir.
[00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:29.704]  Uh, yes, uh, did you happen to, uh, hear Coast to Coast last night?
[00:57:29.704 --> 00:57:31.426]  No.
[00:57:31.426 --> 00:57:34.288]  Uh, George had the first time, or had the, uh,
[00:57:35.114 --> 00:57:38.156]  Uh, Cliff High, I believe his name is, the web bot guy?
[00:57:38.156 --> 00:57:40.717]  Uh-huh.
[00:57:40.717 --> 00:57:47.860]  Uh, he had a lot to say about what you've been talking about, especially about the war.
[00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:58.746]  In October, October surprise, and the first time he said it ever, uh, after November the 14th, he has no info.
[00:58:02.873 --> 00:58:13.055]  Well, I know the web bot tracks trends, kind of like the NSA does, and sees what's popping up, but you can read the Israeli, the US, the British government, all saying they're getting ready to hit Iran.
[00:58:13.055 --> 00:58:15.336]  So, I mean, it's there.
[00:58:15.336 --> 00:58:19.777]  And so they are intending to strike them in the next three months.
[00:58:19.777 --> 00:58:25.438]  The question is, will we get the word out and stop this?
[00:58:25.438 --> 00:58:26.198]  Anything else, Roger?
[00:58:27.472 --> 00:58:27.892]  He's gone?
[00:58:27.892 --> 00:58:29.753]  Okay, we're going to come back with a second hour.
[00:58:29.753 --> 00:58:31.194]  We're going to Tim, Abe, and Jack.
[00:58:31.194 --> 00:58:33.356]  Then I'm going to get into this news as quickly as possible.
[00:58:33.356 --> 00:58:36.518]  And then I'm going to play a clip from Oathkeeper.
[00:58:36.518 --> 00:58:38.839]  Stuart Rhodes gave a powerful 10-minute speech.
[00:58:38.839 --> 00:58:42.781]  That's coming up.
[00:58:42.781 --> 00:58:45.403]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.403 --> 00:58:47.784]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:51.041 --> 00:58:53.862]  Thousands of Americans are facing evacuation.
[00:58:53.862 --> 00:58:59.165]  If you or any of your loved ones might need to evacuate, you must do it yourselves.
[00:58:59.165 --> 00:59:01.966]  Please don't procrastinate until they do it for you.
[00:59:01.966 --> 00:59:05.628]  Remember the terrible conditions of those that didn't get out for Katrina.

[00:59:21.278 --> 00:59:24.361]  It's packed in a rugged heavy-duty tote for transport.
[00:59:24.361 --> 00:59:28.765]  Evacuations are looming with the storms and the Gulf oil catastrophe.
[00:59:28.765 --> 00:59:34.090]  No matter where you live, wildfires, earthquakes, floods, and storms must be escaped.
[00:59:34.090 --> 00:59:37.654]  Don't be like a deer frozen in the headlights of oncoming disasters.
[00:59:37.914 --> 00:59:42.996]  At least prepare yourself with this two-week evacuation pack from efoodsdirect.com.

[00:59:53.599 --> 00:59:56.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.761]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.512 --> 01:00:06.813]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.813 --> 01:00:08.573]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.573 --> 01:00:10.334]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.334 --> 01:00:11.935]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.935 --> 01:00:13.495]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.495 --> 01:00:17.657]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.657 --> 01:00:21.719]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.574 --> 01:00:26.396]  Trillions of dollars are missing from the Pentagon.
[01:00:26.396 --> 01:00:30.237]  Meanwhile, the mainstream media is reporting on 8.7 billion missing.
[01:00:30.237 --> 01:00:30.998]  That's coming up.
[01:00:30.998 --> 01:00:36.400]  We've confirmed the Austin SWAT team is training for martial law, checkpoints, and gun confiscation.
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.621]  Had a call about it yesterday.
[01:00:37.621 --> 01:00:39.722]  I searched the term, found it in the news.
[01:00:39.722 --> 01:00:43.103]  They are over there training in Iraq to see how they set up martial law.
[01:00:43.103 --> 01:00:43.984]  That is coming up.
[01:00:43.984 --> 01:00:46.405]  But right now, let's go back to your calls.
[01:00:46.405 --> 01:00:47.866]  Let's talk to Tim in Washington.
[01:00:47.866 --> 01:00:48.426]  You're on the air.
[01:00:50.084 --> 01:00:51.565]  Hello, how's it going today, Alex?
[01:00:51.565 --> 01:00:54.166]  I have, um, just a couple questions for you real fast.
[01:00:54.166 --> 01:00:59.888]  Have you, um, explored the topic of lightning and corrected it in the Gulf, uh, during Hurricane Tuesday?
[01:00:59.888 --> 01:01:07.652]  Uh, I was, uh, watching some YouTube videos, and they're saying that it's extremely volatile to the point where if you add an organic solution that it just explodes in the beakers.
[01:01:09.431 --> 01:01:13.737]  Well, I mean, Corexit, they first said they used a couple million gallons.
[01:01:13.737 --> 01:01:21.249]  Now they've reported it's 40 plus million gallons, but still diluted in the tens of trillions of gallons of water that you have.
[01:01:21.249 --> 01:01:24.854]  I'm not even sure the volume of the Gulf of Mexico, but it's mega massive.
[01:01:25.695 --> 01:01:28.638]  And a lot of that core exit oil is now going out to the Atlantic, even bigger.
[01:01:28.638 --> 01:01:34.743]  And I know a lot of people are saying, you know, when it all blows into the hurricanes, it's going to be the end of the world.
[01:01:34.743 --> 01:01:40.888]  I think it's going to cause some problems, but I don't think it's going to cause evacuations, you know, 50 to 100 miles, 200 miles in.
[01:01:40.888 --> 01:01:46.093]  Though the government may use that going into the election during the hurricane season as a pretext.
[01:01:46.853 --> 01:01:50.114]  For a political distraction, they use Katrina to confiscate guns.
[01:01:50.114 --> 01:01:52.555]  So I think it is a serious issue.
[01:01:52.555 --> 01:01:56.596]  But weather tends to disperse that stuff all over the place.
[01:01:56.596 --> 01:01:58.597]  It doesn't just uniformly come in.
[01:01:58.597 --> 01:02:03.519]  But yes, we have covered Corexit a lot here on the broadcast.
[01:02:03.519 --> 01:02:07.080]  Mainly just the aspect of lightning strikes.
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:10.141]  And what happens if it's actually hit by lightning?
[01:02:10.141 --> 01:02:12.141]  Will it be volatile enough to ignite?
[01:02:14.656 --> 01:02:41.251]  I've done a little research on that, and again, it pushes the oil underwater and makes the oil break up, and the dispersant is flammable, and they have been burning the oil as well, but I've heard about, you know, for two months, methane bubbles, and we're all dead, and it's gonna be as big as a nuke, but I really think that that's being hyped to the power of 10, but we'll see what happens.
[01:02:41.251 --> 01:02:42.752]  I mean, anything's possible.
[01:02:43.666 --> 01:02:44.187]  Okay.
[01:02:44.187 --> 01:02:46.230]  And also, one last thing.
[01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:53.482]  I was in Portland, Oregon about a month and a half ago, and the census came to my door seven times looking for the previous president.
[01:02:53.482 --> 01:02:56.828]  And he stated that you'll never know when you'll have to separate the race
[01:02:58.863 --> 01:03:02.786]  And I was wondering where you think this fits in with martial law.
[01:03:02.786 --> 01:03:04.387]  Well, I know that it's on record.
[01:03:04.387 --> 01:03:06.269]  Congressional hearings.
[01:03:06.269 --> 01:03:08.090]  Just search the term census used.
[01:03:08.090 --> 01:03:09.151]  In fact, do that right now, folks.
[01:03:09.151 --> 01:03:09.871]  Thanks.
[01:03:09.871 --> 01:03:16.736]  Census used to round up Japanese and Italian-Americans and German-Americans during World War II.
[01:03:16.736 --> 01:03:21.099]  So, I mean, it's always been used for that and they now admit it's being used to track people.
[01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:25.121]  And they want to make it where the census is yearly and then monthly.
[01:03:25.121 --> 01:03:27.321]  And you have a Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination.
[01:03:27.321 --> 01:03:29.122]  You don't have to answer government questions.
[01:03:29.122 --> 01:03:31.682]  All you've got to say is how many people live there.
[01:03:31.682 --> 01:03:35.363]  But they, of course, give them an inch, they take it 1,000 miles.
[01:03:35.363 --> 01:03:36.664]  They're trying to expand their control.
[01:03:36.664 --> 01:03:37.864]  I appreciate your call.
[01:03:37.864 --> 01:03:41.025]  Let's talk to Abe in Ohio, a 770 AM listener.
[01:03:41.025 --> 01:03:41.665]  Abe, you're on the air.
[01:03:43.035 --> 01:04:02.205]  Hi Alex, Colin from here in Eastern Ohio, and last night I finished one of my summer readings that I planned on reading, Huxley's Brave New World, and after reading that and already read 1984, I see short-term 1984, long-term definitely Brave New World.
[01:04:02.205 --> 01:04:03.886]  I just wanted to get your take on that.
[01:04:05.387 --> 01:04:10.248]  Well, you ought to read what Huxley said in speeches and in his book, Brave New World Revisited.
[01:04:10.248 --> 01:04:11.748]  It's non-fiction.
[01:04:11.748 --> 01:04:18.030]  He was telling you what eugenicists, like his brother, the head of the UN, UNESCO program, what they were actually planning.
[01:04:18.030 --> 01:04:24.891]  Of course, he wrote the book in 33, but he wrote Brave New World Revisited, what, in the late 50s?
[01:04:24.891 --> 01:04:25.451]  He died in 62.
[01:04:25.451 --> 01:04:28.932]  I'm going from memory on that, but I've read both books.
[01:04:28.932 --> 01:04:33.133]  We were actually rereading it last night for quotes in the film that we're making right now.
[01:04:34.284 --> 01:04:36.847]  But no, it's very, very hardcore.
[01:04:36.847 --> 01:04:38.188]  That's what they plan for society.
[01:04:38.188 --> 01:04:39.930]  Anything else, Abe?
[01:04:39.930 --> 01:04:41.411]  Yeah, I've been telling my friends this.
[01:04:41.411 --> 01:04:46.476]  I've been a supporter of yours since a couple years, and they just don't believe me.
[01:04:46.476 --> 01:04:54.584]  I told them about the depression coming two years ago, and they're now admitting that I was right, and they still can't take anything that I say with any validity.
[01:04:54.584 --> 01:04:56.245]  Well, they don't have respect for themselves.
[01:04:56.245 --> 01:04:58.568]  That's why they believe that they're just spectators in life.
[01:05:02.723 --> 01:05:04.865]  You're subject to other police action.
[01:05:04.865 --> 01:05:06.146]  Tyranny is here.
[01:05:06.146 --> 01:05:09.709]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:05:09.709 --> 01:05:12.312]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:05:12.312 --> 01:05:18.177]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:05:18.177 --> 01:05:24.422]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:05:24.822 --> 01:05:30.826]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:05:30.826 --> 01:05:34.989]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:05:34.989 --> 01:05:39.272]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:05:39.272 --> 01:05:45.237]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:05:45.237 --> 01:05:48.779]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:05:48.779 --> 01:05:50.760]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:51.201]  It's here.

[01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:00.404]  This information is too important to wait.
[01:08:00.404 --> 01:08:05.471]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:12.800]  We're back live.
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:14.981]  Again, thank you for joining us.
[01:08:14.981 --> 01:08:23.984]  The last 30 minutes of the next hour, we've got Chuck Baldwin, presidential candidate, Constitution Party, 2008, joining us to talk about his article that he wrote.
[01:08:23.984 --> 01:08:26.565]  The federal government declares war on the states.
[01:08:27.915 --> 01:08:31.757]  That is coming up later in the next hour.
[01:08:31.757 --> 01:08:34.959]  Let me go ahead and start news blitzing right now.
[01:08:34.959 --> 01:08:37.060]  I've done more research on WikiLeaks.
[01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:43.084]  I don't believe, that doesn't mean I'm sure, but I don't believe they're bad, that Julian Assange is bad.
[01:08:43.084 --> 01:08:51.409]  But analyzing the latest information they've released, the government now claims they're eyeing an analyst who they think released it.
[01:08:52.503 --> 01:08:55.664]  But the issue here is this is not top secret information.
[01:08:55.664 --> 01:08:56.885]  It's secret.
[01:08:56.885 --> 01:08:58.825]  That's the classification below that.
[01:08:58.825 --> 01:09:01.987]  And they classify, the CIA even classifies mainstream news articles.
[01:09:01.987 --> 01:09:13.211]  You know, that's been in congressional hearings that they'll classify Washington Post articles as if it's classified inside the CIA and Defense Department, meaning they don't want their other analysts reading it, which is crazy.
[01:09:16.513 --> 01:09:22.939]  These are basically 92,000 battlefield reports from colonels and majors and others.
[01:09:22.939 --> 01:09:34.449]  And the Pentagon is famous in planting, especially for internal intelligence and Pentagon hearings with Congress, to paint a false image or picture.
[01:09:34.449 --> 01:09:37.231]  They will lie about body counts when nobody's killed.
[01:09:38.112 --> 01:09:42.895]  They'll claim that they killed a hundred of the enemy, or two hundred of the enemy, or a thousand of the enemy.
[01:09:42.895 --> 01:09:44.255]  They'll create fake reports.
[01:09:44.255 --> 01:09:47.057]  They'll create fake reports about Bin Laden.
[01:09:47.057 --> 01:09:54.981]  The CIA will create fake Bin Laden videos, which they now, two months ago, admitted in the Washington Post that they did create a fake Bin Laden video.
[01:09:54.981 --> 01:09:57.483]  The famous fat Bin Laden that we told you was fake.
[01:09:57.483 --> 01:09:59.344]  Anybody could look at it, it didn't even look like him.
[01:09:59.344 --> 01:10:02.646]  Not even computer generated, just a fake fat guy.
[01:10:02.646 --> 01:10:02.846]  So...
[01:10:04.676 --> 01:10:11.002]  Looking at these documents, it does show some massacres, some cover-ups, but that had already come out.
[01:10:11.002 --> 01:10:14.925]  But mixed in there, they claim Pakistan runs Al-Qaeda and the Taliban.
[01:10:14.925 --> 01:10:18.028]  Well, our own government created the ISI and funds them.
[01:10:18.028 --> 01:10:22.712]  We've got big articles up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com breaking that down.
[01:10:22.712 --> 01:10:31.440]  And so it pushes this idea that, oh look, bin Laden is real and the CIA knows where he is.
[01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:37.423]  And oh, there's intelligence that Bin Laden did do 9-11, but that's secret.
[01:10:37.423 --> 01:10:41.926]  And so, the public and the media then grabs this like it's special information.
[01:10:41.926 --> 01:10:44.768]  Here's the mail today, the mail online.
[01:10:44.768 --> 01:10:46.169]  Glimpses of Bin Laden.
[01:10:46.169 --> 01:10:52.693]  Now WikiLeaks reveals al-Qaeda boss was seen at village meetings despite CIA claims they were clueless.
[01:10:52.693 --> 01:10:55.275]  So, this is a way for the CIA and the globalists
[01:10:56.633 --> 01:11:01.778]  To basically blackmail people they don't like, threaten people with other intelligence they want to release.
[01:11:01.778 --> 01:11:03.540]  It's creating a conduit to do that.
[01:11:07.571 --> 01:11:13.515]  So they go on, now WikiLeaks reveals Al Qaeda boss was seen at village meetings despite CIA claims that they were clueless.
[01:11:13.515 --> 01:11:15.216]  See, oh, it's all real.
[01:11:15.216 --> 01:11:18.118]  Afghanistan war logs shows how U.S.
[01:11:18.118 --> 01:11:20.760]  Marines sanitized record of bloodbath.
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:26.244]  War logs show how Marines gave cleaned up accounts of incident in which they killed 19 civilians.
[01:11:26.244 --> 01:11:34.130]  Well, I mean, you had private Gruckheimer in the Ithaca Times eight years ago come home and say, or seven and a half years ago, and say, oh, we go into villages and kill everyone.
[01:11:34.838 --> 01:11:36.719]  Including children, including babies.
[01:11:36.719 --> 01:11:43.881]  The Pentagon was on Fox saying, well let's clarify, only certain villages do we kill everyone.
[01:11:43.881 --> 01:11:49.503]  Meanwhile, Assange is annoyed by 9-11 truth.
[01:11:49.503 --> 01:12:03.348]  I'm constantly annoyed that people are distracted by false conspiracies such as 9-11 when all around we have evidence of real conspiracies for war or mass financial fraud.
[01:12:03.348 --> 01:12:03.548]  I mean,
[01:12:04.707 --> 01:12:15.474]  You've got all these former presidents, the former Italian president, who was also the former head of their intelligence, saying 9-11's an inside job, the former German defense minister, Andres von Bulow saying it.
[01:12:15.474 --> 01:12:18.516]  All these architects, all these engineers, the official story is a lie!
[01:12:18.516 --> 01:12:24.100]  I mean, they blew up Building 7 in front of us and said, get back, we're blowing it up, on CNN and Fox.
[01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:34.507]  30 minutes before Building 7 fell, they were on CNN and... CNN an hour before, 25 minutes before, on two separate channels, with the exact same script, saying Building 7 had fallen in its own footprint.
[01:12:37.162 --> 01:12:38.463]  You know, it's now been declassified.
[01:12:38.463 --> 01:12:43.905]  Our government staged hundreds of bombings in Europe in the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s to blame it on their political enemies.
[01:12:43.905 --> 01:12:53.009]  Wikileaks did relief two years ago, that army field manual, where army captains and above who were in black ops were taught how to stage false flag attacks.
[01:12:53.009 --> 01:12:55.610]  I mean, this is a dirty business they're in.
[01:12:55.610 --> 01:13:03.233]  Our military, brass, West Point has been trained for the gambit, where you sacrifice a pawn to win the game.
[01:13:05.776 --> 01:13:07.197]  To draw out your enemy.
[01:13:07.197 --> 01:13:12.519]  They'll send troops off on missions where thousands die knowing it's going to draw the enemy out.
[01:13:12.519 --> 01:13:19.263]  That's part of their strategic system of control.
[01:13:19.263 --> 01:13:21.684]  And of course they'll stage terror attacks.
[01:13:21.684 --> 01:13:22.804]  We have Operation Northwoods.
[01:13:22.804 --> 01:13:23.645]  That's real.
[01:13:23.645 --> 01:13:27.026]  That's ABC News, Associated Press, Baltimore Sun.
[01:13:27.026 --> 01:13:28.167]  That's not debated.
[01:13:30.521 --> 01:13:34.625]  Operation Gladio, Operation Ajax, all of these are on record.
[01:13:34.625 --> 01:13:36.626]  But Assange says, you know, it's irritating.
[01:13:36.626 --> 01:13:40.490]  He doesn't want to talk about those documents.
[01:13:40.490 --> 01:13:44.133]  Continuing, the Pentagon is eyeing an accused analyst over WikiLeaks data.
[01:13:44.133 --> 01:13:46.836]  This is the Wall Street Journal.
[01:13:46.836 --> 01:13:49.798]  Military investigators are checking computers used by Bradley Manning, a U.S.
[01:13:49.798 --> 01:13:57.325]  Army intelligence analyst, charged this month with leaking classified information to see if he is the source of thousands of military documents published by WikiLeaks.
[01:13:59.019 --> 01:14:20.860]  And what they are is a bunch of propaganda-filled garbage pushing the official story and blaming Hamid Gul, who was the big star of the CIA as the head of Pakistani intelligence fighting the Russians in Afghanistan, who contacted this radio show two years ago, or right after the Mumbai attacks happened, almost two years ago, to say Western intelligence carried this out.
[01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:23.363]  And then it came out in mainstream US papers in the last three months.
[01:14:25.353 --> 01:14:25.993]  That a U.S.
[01:14:25.993 --> 01:14:31.077]  intelligence agent was the, quote, commander of the attacks in India.
[01:14:31.077 --> 01:14:43.486]  And they had a Pakistani intelligence, excuse me, the head of Indian intelligence, who was killed that day in those attacks, said that day it was a staged event, as it started, to the major newspapers like the Times of India.
[01:14:45.469 --> 01:14:47.451]  Here's a Kurt Nemo story that breaks this down.
[01:14:47.451 --> 01:14:50.154]  WikiLeaks docs target Pakistan.
[01:14:50.154 --> 01:14:56.900]  Very well written article detailing how if Pakistani intelligence is funding Al-Qaeda and Taliban, well who funds them?
[01:14:56.900 --> 01:15:00.544]  The West.
[01:15:00.544 --> 01:15:04.248]  So that's the information on that front.
[01:15:04.248 --> 01:15:07.231]  Let me now get into this article.
[01:15:09.229 --> 01:15:14.653]  This is out of Federal News Radio, 1500 AM.
[01:15:14.653 --> 01:15:17.755]  Top story on Drudge, at least it was an hour ago.
[01:15:17.755 --> 01:15:19.196]  And we're glad Drudge is linking to this.
[01:15:19.196 --> 01:15:31.304]  The point is, the media is focusing on 8.7 billion, billion missing, and not focusing on Congressional hearings in 2001, 2003, 4, and 5.
[01:15:31.304 --> 01:15:36.628]  And you can just search, Rumsfeld being grilled about missing trillions.
[01:15:36.628 --> 01:15:38.389]  You can see the C-SPAN clips on YouTube.
[01:15:40.441 --> 01:15:41.161]  We uploaded them.
[01:15:41.161 --> 01:15:43.983]  That's how I know they're there.
[01:15:43.983 --> 01:15:46.965]  And he says, yeah, I'm not going to tell you where the trillions are.
[01:15:46.965 --> 01:15:51.088]  And then he has the head of the Office of Budget from the Pentagon, Dr. Chu.
[01:15:51.088 --> 01:15:54.150]  And Chu says that, you know, he won't say.
[01:15:54.150 --> 01:15:58.353]  He looks like a bad guy from a James Bond movie.
[01:15:58.353 --> 01:16:02.195]  But I found an archived clip that somebody in 2006 put on YouTube from a 2001 CBS News clip.
[01:16:02.195 --> 01:16:03.036]  It's very bad quality.
[01:16:07.403 --> 01:16:11.406]  But you can just search for the headline for this video and find it.
[01:16:11.406 --> 01:16:12.607]  We'll give you that headline in a moment.
[01:16:12.607 --> 01:16:17.011]  In fact, let's go ahead and play a short clip of the big issue.
[01:16:17.011 --> 01:16:24.617]  Because while you're busy worrying about $8.7 billion, it was $2.3, then it was $4, then it was $5.
[01:16:24.617 --> 01:16:27.960]  Last time they had a hearing in 2005, it was over $5 trillion missing.
[01:16:30.165 --> 01:16:32.208]  Because they've raided the Pentagon pension funds.
[01:16:32.208 --> 01:16:37.354]  That's why they're announcing they don't want to give healthcare and Obama didn't want to, wanted to make veterans pay for their own insurance.
[01:16:37.354 --> 01:16:38.415]  Remember that?
[01:16:38.415 --> 01:16:40.878]  We had the head of the VFW on last year about it.
[01:16:40.878 --> 01:16:44.262]  He was in a meeting with Obama when he proposed it.
[01:16:44.262 --> 01:16:47.066]  Because they've stolen all your money that was put in there to pay for things.
[01:16:48.473 --> 01:16:54.555]  There's not just the $2 trillion a year, the $1 trillion, $200 billion on budget, the $100 billion off budget, then all the black budget money.
[01:16:54.555 --> 01:16:56.796]  There's all the other Pentagon investments.
[01:16:56.796 --> 01:16:58.857]  They buy stocks and bonds and derivatives.
[01:16:58.857 --> 01:16:59.917]  And it's all been stolen.
[01:16:59.917 --> 01:17:01.838]  And it's as big as the banking heist.
[01:17:01.838 --> 01:17:05.819]  Let's go ahead and play this clip from eight plus years ago.
[01:17:05.819 --> 01:17:10.020]  From September 10th, 2001.
[01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:11.021]  Almost nine years ago.
[01:17:11.021 --> 01:17:11.341]  Here it is.
[01:17:13.029 --> 01:17:13.990]  The Pentagon.
[01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:16.253]  The day before 9-1-1.
[01:17:16.253 --> 01:17:19.778]  Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld declared war.
[01:17:19.778 --> 01:17:21.600]  Not on foreign terrorists.
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:22.881]  The adversary is closer to home.
[01:17:24.062 --> 01:17:26.003]  It's the Pentagon bureaucracy.
[01:17:26.003 --> 01:17:30.066]  He said money wasted by the military poses a serious threat.
[01:17:30.066 --> 01:17:32.928]  In fact, it could be said that it's a matter of life and death.
[01:17:32.928 --> 01:17:39.293]  Rumsfeld promised change, but the next day, the world changed.
[01:17:39.293 --> 01:17:44.797]  And in the rush to fund the war on terrorism, the war on waste seems to have been forgotten.
[01:17:44.797 --> 01:17:49.120]  My O3 budget calls for more than
[01:17:50.458 --> 01:17:52.480]  $48 billion in new defense spending.
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:18:00.105]  More money for the Pentagon when its own auditors admit the military cannot account for 25% of what it already spends.
[01:18:00.105 --> 01:18:02.807]  According to some estimates, we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions.
[01:18:02.807 --> 01:18:06.730]  $2.3 trillion, with a T. That's $8,000 for every man, woman, and child in America.
[01:18:12.634 --> 01:18:21.635]  To understand how the Pentagon can lose track of trillions, consider the case of one military accountant who tried to find out what happened to a mere 300 million.
[01:18:21.635 --> 01:18:22.337]  We know it's gone.
[01:18:23.891 --> 01:18:25.732]  Well, we don't know what they spent it on.
[01:18:25.732 --> 01:18:28.393]  Jim Minnery, a former Marine turned whistleblower.
[01:18:28.393 --> 01:18:35.276]  Kurt Nemo is doing a story on this, and we'll get that video posted up there on InfoWars.com.
[01:18:35.276 --> 01:18:36.056]  You want to watch the whole thing.
[01:18:36.056 --> 01:18:40.878]  But I played that because if I just read a CBS News headline to you, you're not going to believe it.
[01:18:40.878 --> 01:18:46.741]  Or if I read to you a Oregonian headline or an AP article, people like to see it and hear it.
[01:18:46.741 --> 01:18:47.481]  So there it is.
[01:18:49.045 --> 01:18:53.326]  And the title is Rumsfeld Says $2.3 Trillion Missing From Pentagon.
[01:18:53.326 --> 01:18:54.967]  If you want to watch that video.
[01:18:54.967 --> 01:18:55.587]  Good job guys.
[01:18:55.587 --> 01:18:57.207]  Pull that up on short notice.
[01:18:57.207 --> 01:19:05.710]  So while we're talking about $8.7 billion, he did that basically because he was involved in the cover-up to look like he was going to investigate it.
[01:19:05.710 --> 01:19:13.412]  Once he got into power, he covered the whole thing up and it was $5 plus trillion by the time they had the last hearing five years ago on it.
[01:19:13.412 --> 01:19:14.352]  I don't know what it is now.
[01:19:15.721 --> 01:19:22.928]  $5 trillion plus missing, and the media is talking about $8.7 billion missing today.
[01:19:22.928 --> 01:19:26.171]  No, it's over $5 trillion and growing.
[01:19:26.171 --> 01:19:30.354]  I don't know what the new numbers are, because now it's not even looked at.
[01:19:30.354 --> 01:19:32.196]  And in Congress, they say, where's the money?
[01:19:32.196 --> 01:19:35.319]  And they go, we're not going to tell you.
[01:19:35.319 --> 01:19:36.120]  Well, where's the $5 trillion?
[01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:39.423]  We're not going to tell you.
[01:19:39.423 --> 01:19:41.024]  That's just the end of it.
[01:19:41.024 --> 01:19:41.865]  You understand, slave?
[01:19:43.533 --> 01:19:55.463]  See, the government is above the law, and the corporations that feed from the trough are above the law, but you, the average citizen, they're passing new laws all the time to make normal behavior illegal, so they can get you into their system.
[01:19:55.463 --> 01:19:59.487]  The only industry we've got left in this country is people working in private prisons, competing with the private sector.
[01:19:59.487 --> 01:20:00.268]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:03.802]  You worry, but only because you're paying attention.
[01:20:03.802 --> 01:20:07.365]  What's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature.
[01:20:07.365 --> 01:20:15.851]  A similar audacity called GMO, or genetically modified organisms, means that the quality of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health in the balance.
[01:20:15.851 --> 01:20:21.336]  Now that summer's here, what better time to learn about the bounty that nature provides in wild edible food?
[01:20:21.336 --> 01:20:26.440]  Let author Linda Runyon show you the best-kept secret in plain sight that food is everywhere you look.
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:35.008]  This summer, for the cost of a good meal or two out, you can literally starvation-proof yourself and your loved ones against any future craziness, and put up tons of free food too.
[01:20:35.008 --> 01:20:40.454]  Whatever experiment is being run on us, you can rest assured that Linda's 50 or so staple foods aren't involved.
[01:20:40.454 --> 01:20:41.675]  Our foods are their enemy.
[01:20:42.276 --> 01:20:48.123]  So go to offthefield.com or call toll-free 1-888-51-EAT-FREE and take that first step.
[01:20:48.123 --> 01:20:51.107]  Make your oasis of food security and nutrition now.
[01:20:51.107 --> 01:20:54.371]  That's O-F-T-H-E-F-I-E-L-D dot com or call 1-888-513-2837.
[01:20:54.371 --> 01:20:55.853]  Start now and make 2010 your year of independence!
[01:21:01.294 --> 01:21:06.258]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:21:06.258 --> 01:21:07.258]  What have we got?
[01:21:07.258 --> 01:21:09.700]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:10.701]  A republic.
[01:21:10.701 --> 01:21:13.363]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:21:13.363 --> 01:21:15.625]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:21:15.625 --> 01:21:17.646]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:21:17.646 --> 01:21:19.327]  So they think they own our land?
[01:21:19.327 --> 01:21:20.648]  They think they own our water?
[01:21:20.648 --> 01:21:21.269]  Children?
[01:21:21.269 --> 01:21:22.390]  Our education?
[01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:23.210]  Our money?
[01:21:23.210 --> 01:21:26.853]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:21:27.213 --> 01:21:30.917]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:21:30.917 --> 01:21:32.199]  You have been warned.
[01:21:32.199 --> 01:21:33.220]  We have the facts.
[01:21:33.220 --> 01:21:34.381]  We have the Constitution.
[01:21:34.381 --> 01:21:35.283]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:21:35.283 --> 01:21:36.164]  We have common law.
[01:21:36.164 --> 01:21:38.707]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:21:38.707 --> 01:21:42.471]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:21:42.571 --> 01:21:47.535]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:21:47.535 --> 01:21:49.037]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:21:49.037 --> 01:21:50.118]  Don't tread on me.
[01:21:50.118 --> 01:21:56.984]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:22:01.894 --> 01:22:02.915]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:22:02.915 --> 01:22:08.442]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[01:22:08.442 --> 01:22:09.003]  I get it.
[01:22:09.003 --> 01:22:18.615]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:22:18.615 --> 01:22:19.777]  That's not what's happening.
[01:22:20.017 --> 01:22:28.482]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[01:22:28.482 --> 01:22:31.884]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:22:31.884 --> 01:22:36.147]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:22:36.147 --> 01:22:37.747]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:22:37.747 --> 01:22:41.710]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[01:22:41.710 --> 01:22:45.312]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:22:45.512 --> 01:22:46.413]  You should too.
[01:22:46.413 --> 01:22:47.574]  Find out what they know.
[01:22:47.574 --> 01:22:50.937]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[01:22:50.937 --> 01:22:51.197]  800-686-2237.
[01:22:51.197 --> 01:22:51.257]  800-686-2237.
[01:22:51.257 --> 01:22:51.457]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:01.499 --> 01:23:05.020]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:07.321]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:23:07.321 --> 01:23:08.181]  Don't!
[01:23:08.181 --> 01:23:11.623]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[01:23:11.623 --> 01:23:18.745]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[01:23:18.725 --> 01:23:20.706]  's number one debt secret.
[01:23:20.706 --> 01:23:24.387]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[01:23:24.767 --> 01:23:27.530]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[01:23:27.530 --> 01:23:35.299]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[01:23:35.299 --> 01:23:36.500]  Herb K was right.
[01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:39.524]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[01:23:39.684 --> 01:23:40.944]  What do you have to lose?
[01:23:40.944 --> 01:23:42.165]  Stop the calls now.
[01:23:42.165 --> 01:23:44.125]  Get out of debt and have more money.
[01:23:44.125 --> 01:23:44.706]  Get Herb K.'
[01:23:44.646 --> 01:23:47.166]  's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[01:23:47.166 --> 01:23:47.767]  Call 800-405-7850.
[01:23:47.767 --> 01:23:48.367]  That's 800-405-7850.
[01:23:48.367 --> 01:23:48.407]  800-405-7850.
[01:24:14.495 --> 01:24:26.105]  On a lonely, lonesome highway East of Omaha You listen to the engine moaning out his one old song
[01:24:34.281 --> 01:24:36.061]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:36.061 --> 01:24:37.202]  I'm here Monday through Friday.
[01:24:37.202 --> 01:24:39.322]  We kick the broadcast off at 11 a.m.
[01:24:39.322 --> 01:24:40.922]  Central.
[01:24:40.922 --> 01:24:43.503]  That is 12 noon Eastern.
[01:24:43.503 --> 01:24:49.765]  We got Chuck Baldwin coming up the last 30 minutes of the next hour to talk about his article.
[01:24:49.765 --> 01:24:52.545]  The federal government declares war on the states.
[01:24:52.545 --> 01:24:54.286]  We'll break that down.
[01:24:57.725 --> 01:25:09.773]  But I want to get back into the fact that the AP and Reuters are reporting that Ahmadinejad says the next three months they have intel that the US and Israel are both going to attack their country and probably Syria.
[01:25:09.773 --> 01:25:22.081]  You've got troops mashing in and around Venezuela and off the coast, openly saying that they claim weapons are being given to Iran by Venezuela, so they're gearing up for strikes on Venezuela.
[01:25:22.081 --> 01:25:27.145]  This is looking like World War III, and many analysts are calling it World War III.
[01:25:28.786 --> 01:25:36.634]  Meanwhile, the Pentagon has trillions and trillions of dollars missing, and this hasn't been in the news in five years.
[01:25:36.634 --> 01:25:51.328]  Oh, they'll talk about some army officer who steals a computer, or they'll talk about waste and abuse, and they'll talk about little corruption, but they don't talk about trillions and trillions and trillions disappearing out of the pension fund system.
[01:25:52.062 --> 01:25:56.124]  Disappearing out of the Pentagon and armed services investments.
[01:25:56.124 --> 01:26:01.246]  Remember, water districts, school districts, counties, cities, states, federal bureaucracies.
[01:26:01.246 --> 01:26:02.606]  Tens of thousands of them.
[01:26:02.606 --> 01:26:08.149]  Tens of thousands of counties alone are all investing your money in the global stock market.
[01:26:08.149 --> 01:26:13.051]  Then the bankers take that and use that to come in and buy up your roads and your infrastructure.
[01:26:13.051 --> 01:26:15.552]  This is financial full-spectrum dominance.
[01:26:15.552 --> 01:26:19.253]  Medical federalization, but the profits are private.
[01:26:19.253 --> 01:26:20.294]  Full-spectrum dominance.
[01:26:21.855 --> 01:26:23.516]  The police are being federalized.
[01:26:23.516 --> 01:26:24.596]  Full spectrum dominance.
[01:26:24.596 --> 01:26:28.338]  And we're going to talk about that coming up in the next segment.
[01:26:28.338 --> 01:26:42.367]  But Stuart Rhodes, they posted a video, the Oath Keepers did out of Oklahoma, of him giving a very powerful nine and a half minute speech that I'm going to play coming up in the second half of the next long segment.
[01:26:43.257 --> 01:27:07.345]  uh... but uh... that will first dovetail that guys pull this up is on a play a little bit of his call it's it's on my alex jones youtube channel that says uh... you know uh... uh... iraq vet says uh... austin police training to set up checkpoints it's even worse than that go door-to-door basically confiscate guns a short clip of that we come back because because people
[01:27:08.749 --> 01:27:12.873]  We're in those comments about a third of them saying he was a liar, that it wasn't true.
[01:27:12.873 --> 01:27:15.375]  In fact, I'm gonna get into this right now.
[01:27:15.375 --> 01:27:19.979]  Here is the Fort Hood Sentinel.
[01:27:19.979 --> 01:27:29.667]  Here is the Fort Hood Sentinel, biggest military base in the world, about 45 miles north of Austin, northwest of Austin.
[01:27:29.667 --> 01:27:32.849]  And who did the caller say was there?
[01:27:32.849 --> 01:27:36.753]  The head of the Austin SWAT team and someone with their intelligence group.
[01:27:37.950 --> 01:27:39.754]  What does this article say?
[01:27:39.754 --> 01:27:46.550]  It says the head of the SWAT team and the head of intelligence along with city officials and judges
[01:27:47.955 --> 01:27:53.419]  Are being trained, and this is even a cover story, but it's still bad, at the base.
[01:27:53.419 --> 01:28:01.043]  And then as a footnote, they say that the SWAT team commander and others had just returned from Iraq.
[01:28:01.043 --> 01:28:05.606]  I had a unique perspective because I recently had gone to Iraq to evaluate law enforcement over there.
[01:28:05.606 --> 01:28:09.489]  I was lucky enough to be able to volunteer and assist with the third ACR training.
[01:28:10.540 --> 01:28:11.261]  We had the caller.
[01:28:11.261 --> 01:28:12.602]  They were running real checkpoints.
[01:28:12.602 --> 01:28:17.326]  They call that training and searching people and going door-to-door gun confiscation drills.
[01:28:17.326 --> 01:28:22.031]  We're showing the soldiers urban law enforcement so they can go and train the Iraqi police.
[01:28:22.031 --> 01:28:22.952]  They always spin that.
[01:28:22.952 --> 01:28:24.553]  No, they were being trained.
[01:28:24.553 --> 01:28:25.854]  He goes on to admit that.
[01:28:25.854 --> 01:28:27.296]  He goes, actually, we were being trained.
[01:28:27.296 --> 01:28:28.997]  Listen to this.
[01:28:28.997 --> 01:28:34.583]  The army obviously doesn't need any instructions from us on how to shoot and engage in combat because they are the best in the world at doing that.
[01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:41.801]  But having to go in with a softer approach and more of a law enforcement type approach, now that is maybe something we can show them.
[01:28:41.801 --> 01:28:47.202]  Reflecting on the training, Denton added, the training was symbolic.
[01:28:47.202 --> 01:28:50.583]  We're APD probably learned more than we were taught to a man.
[01:28:50.583 --> 01:28:55.904]  All of these third ACR soldiers have been motivated, energetic, and bright.
[01:28:55.904 --> 01:28:59.165]  So the caller, exactly what he told us, is what is in this article.
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.261]  So, there you have it.
[01:29:02.261 --> 01:29:05.503]  And of course, this is just an isolated incident.
[01:29:05.503 --> 01:29:11.827]  You've got the Marines, and the Army, and Homeland Security, and the National Guard in Tennessee last year.
[01:29:11.827 --> 01:29:13.549]  It's in Police State 4, the rise of FEMA.
[01:29:14.346 --> 01:29:15.547]  We had a state rep on.
[01:29:15.547 --> 01:29:18.891]  The governor says, you're shutting down highways and the army searching people don't do that.
[01:29:18.891 --> 01:29:20.993]  And they said, we're going to do it anyways.
[01:29:20.993 --> 01:29:25.498]  Same thing in California with the Marines at drunk driving checkpoints with guns.
[01:29:25.498 --> 01:29:32.225]  Same thing when I've been in New York and 100 yards away, troops run over wearing 45s screaming, don't videotape me, you bleeping scum.
[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:35.801]  That's an endgame blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:29:35.801 --> 01:29:41.603]  They are just openly integrating it, and then you get the MIAC and Homeland Security reports that law enforcement gave us.
[01:29:41.603 --> 01:29:43.143]  Who are they training for?
[01:29:43.143 --> 01:29:51.246]  Even with the Explorer Scouts to take on disgruntled veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, in the fetters, get us out of the UNers and birthers.
[01:29:51.246 --> 01:29:52.626]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.626 --> 01:29:55.147]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.147 --> 01:29:57.828]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.626 --> 01:30:05.169]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:05.169 --> 01:30:06.089]  Number 1.
[01:30:06.089 --> 01:30:09.512]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.512 --> 01:30:10.372]  Number 2.
[01:30:10.372 --> 01:30:15.275]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:15.275 --> 01:30:16.016]  It's true.
[01:30:16.016 --> 01:30:20.879]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:20.879 --> 01:30:21.719]  Number 3.
[01:30:21.719 --> 01:30:25.302]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:25.302 --> 01:30:29.004]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:29.204 --> 01:30:30.004]  Number 4.
[01:30:30.004 --> 01:30:32.765]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.765 --> 01:30:36.446]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:36.446 --> 01:30:37.226]  Number 5.
[01:30:37.226 --> 01:30:41.367]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:41.367 --> 01:30:46.429]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:30:46.429 --> 01:30:50.590]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:31:04.617 --> 01:31:11.021]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:31:11.021 --> 01:31:14.923]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me
[01:31:15.103 --> 01:31:18.404]  How much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry and dishes.
[01:31:18.404 --> 01:31:23.287]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving, triple concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:31:31.950 --> 01:31:35.672]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter and see what he has to say.
[01:31:36.192 --> 01:31:42.954]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:31:42.954 --> 01:31:46.856]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[01:31:53.238 --> 01:31:54.438]  Thank you.
[01:32:00.287 --> 01:32:04.388]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[01:32:45.228 --> 01:32:45.649]  Look for Max.
[01:32:46.049 --> 01:32:49.452]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:17.498 --> 01:33:19.602]  Let's go ahead and jam in another call here.
[01:33:19.602 --> 01:33:20.844]  Let's talk to Mike in Texas.
[01:33:20.844 --> 01:33:21.445]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:33:22.657 --> 01:33:24.759]  Hey Alex, my name's Mike.
[01:33:24.759 --> 01:33:25.820]  I'm stationed here at Fort Lloyd.
[01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:28.002]  I'm originally from Dallas.
[01:33:28.002 --> 01:33:30.424]  What I'm about to tell you might hit home, so I'm sorry to do so.
[01:33:30.424 --> 01:33:32.746]  You might already know about it, but if you do, this might verify.
[01:33:32.746 --> 01:33:39.952]  I just got back from a tour in Iraq a few months ago, and what I did there was a security escort gunner.
[01:33:39.952 --> 01:33:45.156]  And the best way to describe that would be the opening scene of Iron Man, the people taking Tony Stark around.
[01:33:45.156 --> 01:33:45.837]  That's what we did.
[01:33:45.837 --> 01:33:49.080]  Of course, none of the civilians were near as cool, so it was a little bit difficult.
[01:33:50.361 --> 01:33:53.123]  Most of them are doctors of agriculture and doctors of science.
[01:33:53.123 --> 01:33:54.705]  We transport them all around.
[01:33:54.705 --> 01:34:00.130]  But the most interesting thing, and of course I have stories about that, but for another time, it's a little bit lengthy.
[01:34:00.130 --> 01:34:05.194]  But most importantly, one day we had one of our mission briefings in the very early morning.
[01:34:05.194 --> 01:34:07.797]  We had two guys come out in marine jumpsuits.
[01:34:08.837 --> 01:34:15.664]  And, uh, they look like our Mechanics jumpsuits, but, uh, and they were wearing our gear, as far as Bulletproof Vesco and the IBAs and the IOTVs.
[01:34:15.664 --> 01:34:21.551]  Um, and I saw on their patch a little bit further, they didn't have American flags, but they had Austin SWAT patches.
[01:34:24.553 --> 01:34:26.815]  Yeah, from Austin, Texas.
[01:34:26.815 --> 01:34:28.537]  Yes, from Austin, Texas.
[01:34:28.537 --> 01:34:33.901]  Now these are veterans, not veterans of our war, but veterans of our Austin, Texas SWAT team.
[01:34:33.901 --> 01:34:34.541]  That's right.
[01:34:34.541 --> 01:34:41.387]  And what they were doing there was training to learn how we set up our military police checkpoints and how we do raids on houses.
[01:34:41.387 --> 01:34:42.388]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:34:42.388 --> 01:34:43.269]  This is key info.
[01:34:43.269 --> 01:34:44.069]  Stay with us.
[01:34:44.069 --> 01:34:51.655]  Alright, so then we came back and got more intel from him and literally people were in the comments saying it wasn't real.
[01:34:51.655 --> 01:34:53.257]  Well, here's the Fort Hood Sentinel.
[01:34:54.238 --> 01:35:00.482]  And you can type in police train with the military in Iraq and find hundreds of police departments doing this.
[01:35:00.482 --> 01:35:01.623]  And what are they training for?
[01:35:01.623 --> 01:35:07.567]  Shutting down whole highways, searching everyone, and going door-to-door for gun confiscation.
[01:35:07.567 --> 01:35:09.448]  Now that is what they're training for.
[01:35:09.448 --> 01:35:12.330]  The headline is brave rifles train with APD.
[01:35:15.049 --> 01:35:36.475]  The number one threat to a free society, if you've studied history, whether it was Rome 2,060-something years ago with Julius Caesar, or whether it's Venezuela, or whether it's Nigeria, or whether it was Nazi Germany, is powerful forces using the military to overthrow the country under the guise of fighting a crisis.
[01:35:36.475 --> 01:35:43.397]  Remember what Smedley Butler, two-time Congressional Medal of Honor winner, he was in line to be the Commandant of the Marine Corps.
[01:35:44.707 --> 01:35:47.348]  And they asked him, they said, we want to make you the commandant.
[01:35:47.348 --> 01:35:56.110]  We want you to lead the Marine Corps, because he'd used the Marine Corps himself in more than 11 nations to overthrow countries for the robber barons that were running our country.
[01:35:56.110 --> 01:35:58.111]  He wrote the book, War is a Racket.
[01:35:58.111 --> 01:36:07.573]  They brought him into meetings with George Herbert Walker Bush's father, Prescott Bush, and the Harrimans and others.
[01:36:07.573 --> 01:36:10.434]  And they said, we're going to overthrow America and have martial law.
[01:36:11.867 --> 01:36:16.210]  And he went and blew the whistle to Congress, and they had the McCormick-Dickstein Committee hearings.
[01:36:16.210 --> 01:36:22.535]  And we have clips of that in my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:36:22.535 --> 01:36:27.018]  But that's the issue, and he played along with it, got the intel, and stopped it.
[01:36:27.018 --> 01:36:31.081]  Now, that was a full frontal assault takeover plan.
[01:36:31.081 --> 01:36:36.645]  And it was so embarrassing, they didn't prosecute Prescott Bush and others.
[01:36:36.645 --> 01:36:37.366]  They just dropped it.
[01:36:39.537 --> 01:36:53.441]  Now, this has been a long, at least 30-year program, this has been going on since the 80s, to integrate the military and police, and militarize police, kill people, and break things.
[01:36:53.441 --> 01:36:55.401]  That's their job, that's their training.
[01:36:55.401 --> 01:37:07.885]  And if you've studied history and have common sense, there's no doubt they are brainwashing our military, our police, they're integrating them, they're now saying they're gonna use them domestically to fight crime and to do gun confiscations in Illinois, that's Chicago Tribune.
[01:37:09.588 --> 01:37:13.229]  The mayor of Schenectady, New York is calling for martial law.
[01:37:13.229 --> 01:37:19.971]  Troops are at all these different high visibility events, all to acclimate the population.
[01:37:19.971 --> 01:37:34.275]  In a few minutes, I'm going to play a Stuart Rhodes clip that is so vitally important, where he, as the founder and head of Oath Keepers, talks about why they're being demonized by the ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, and the mainstream media.
[01:37:34.275 --> 01:37:36.956]  Why what they're doing is so important.
[01:37:36.956 --> 01:37:39.117]  This is a message to all police, all military.
[01:37:40.609 --> 01:37:46.430]  You're trained and compartmentalized that you're doing a good job, that you're given false reasons.
[01:37:46.430 --> 01:37:49.671]  Military, police, remember 10 years ago while you were told all this training was going on?
[01:37:49.671 --> 01:37:54.152]  You were told it was for overseas, now they're telling you it's for domestic.
[01:37:54.152 --> 01:37:58.433]  I told you it was for domestic, we got the army documents.
[01:37:58.433 --> 01:38:03.834]  That's in my film, Police State 2, The Takeover, that it is for a domestic takeover, and it is targeted at the American people.
[01:38:03.834 --> 01:38:08.235]  It has nothing to do with hajis, as they're called, in the Pentagon.
[01:38:09.053 --> 01:38:13.135]  Kind of a racial slang they use that I find offensive and I know many others do.
[01:38:13.135 --> 01:38:19.438]  We're going to play this video here in just a moment, but first I want to tell you about some of the great sponsors that made today's radio show possible.
[01:38:19.438 --> 01:38:20.378]  One of them is Interfood.
[01:38:20.378 --> 01:38:21.599]  We live in a toxic environment.
[01:38:21.599 --> 01:38:26.221]  Daily we are bombarded with chemicals, fluorides, pesticides, and other equally toxic chemicals.
[01:38:26.221 --> 01:38:30.643]  The folks on the Gulf Coast now have to worry about benzene and other toxins.
[01:38:30.643 --> 01:38:36.846]  To stay ahead of the complicated games the New World Order plays, you have to stay healthy, and the products from Interfood Botanicals will help you
[01:38:37.526 --> 01:38:39.127]  Stay on top of your game in the fights.
[01:38:39.127 --> 01:38:40.449]  The best superfood out there.
[01:38:40.449 --> 01:38:41.309]  20 superfoods.
[01:38:41.309 --> 01:38:43.731]  You absorb it all because it's food, not vitamins.
[01:38:43.731 --> 01:38:44.632]  The vitamins are in the food.
[01:38:44.632 --> 01:38:46.754]  The minerals, the nutrients, the trace minerals.
[01:38:46.754 --> 01:38:48.255]  These guys have been around for six years.
[01:38:48.255 --> 01:38:49.176]  They're great patriots.
[01:38:49.176 --> 01:38:49.556]  I love them.
[01:38:49.556 --> 01:38:50.437]  My wife uses it.
[01:38:50.437 --> 01:38:51.318]  I use it.
[01:38:51.318 --> 01:38:52.359]  Rob Jacobson uses it.
[01:38:52.359 --> 01:38:53.159]  Aaron uses it.
[01:38:53.159 --> 01:38:54.260]  We all love it.
[01:38:54.260 --> 01:38:57.243]  Interfood builds your body's defenses and helps get rid of toxins.
[01:38:57.243 --> 01:39:00.105]  Try the Alex Jones Combo with the coconut milk powder.
[01:39:00.105 --> 01:39:01.766]  I love their NutriCafe coffee.
[01:39:01.766 --> 01:39:03.068]  They're just wonderful folks.
[01:39:03.068 --> 01:39:05.430]  They have a ton of other great herbal products that really work.
[01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:14.324]  Check them out at innerfood.com, E-N-E-R, food.com, innerfood.com, or give them a call at 866-762-9238.
[01:39:14.324 --> 01:39:15.826]  That's Inner Food, ladies and gentlemen, 866-762-9238.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:28.126]  And finally, to have a strong body, we need to stop drinking the fluoride, the poisons, the arsenic, the mercury that they put in the water supply.
[01:39:28.126 --> 01:39:31.689]  They put it, not just fluoride, in the water supply, but over 300 chemicals.
[01:39:31.689 --> 01:39:35.151]  It's usually about 150, but some over 300 that's put in your water supply.
[01:39:35.151 --> 01:39:36.913]  I want to tell you about purewaterfreedom.com.
[01:39:38.914 --> 01:39:42.515]  If you want to affordably remove fluoride from your tap water, visit purewaterfreedom.com.
[01:39:42.515 --> 01:39:44.836]  They have a full line of household filters.
[01:39:44.836 --> 01:39:48.257]  You can even remove fluoride from every water source in your home, shower, bath, you name it.
[01:39:48.257 --> 01:39:51.219]  They have tabletop units, whole house, you name it.
[01:39:51.219 --> 01:39:57.181]  They have a wide variety of filters to remove all types, and the best part of it is they're made in the USA.
[01:39:58.294 --> 01:40:00.377]  Born in the USA, made in the USA.
[01:40:00.377 --> 01:40:04.481]  Check out their banner on InfoWars.com or go to PureWaterFreedom.com today.
[01:40:04.481 --> 01:40:10.869]  That's PureWaterFreedom.com, ladies and gentlemen, and start taking control of your own life.
[01:40:13.044 --> 01:40:20.830]  It is so chilling to know that the Austin SWAT team and countless other SWAT teams are training with the military domestically to take on the American people.
[01:40:20.830 --> 01:40:28.456]  We've got their intelligence reports that are given where they demonize Ron Paul, in the fetters, returning veterans, constitutionalist, red-blooded Americans.
[01:40:29.454 --> 01:40:37.457]  And Stuart Rhodes, the founder of Oath Keepers two years ago, has traveled the country and has reached millions of former servicemen and millions of police.
[01:40:37.457 --> 01:40:43.920]  And they're really waking up and learning what their sacred honor is all about and what that oath is really about.
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:48.202]  And I saw this video, it's posted up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:40:48.202 --> 01:40:55.245]  I saw this video that was just released yesterday, and it's so pertinent to every issue that we're facing.
[01:40:55.245 --> 01:40:57.926]  That if tyranny's gonna come to your door, it's gonna come in a uniform.
[01:40:58.546 --> 01:41:09.393]  And police and military and other people in government, a lot of them who are on power trips and feel like they're part of a club and a winning team, who feel like the public's against them and it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[01:41:09.393 --> 01:41:10.514]  We then become against them.
[01:41:10.514 --> 01:41:18.019]  They then, you know, start not liking us as they carry out more and more draconian things that are unconstitutional.
[01:41:18.019 --> 01:41:22.742]  We have to come together and they have to decide which side they're on in this key time in history.
[01:41:22.742 --> 01:41:26.525]  So here is this key video with Stuart Rhodes from Oath Keepers.
[01:41:26.525 --> 01:41:26.825]  Here it is.
[01:41:29.394 --> 01:41:34.718]  When you took that oath, every one of you ever served in the military, police, or even firefighters have taken an oath.
[01:41:34.718 --> 01:41:38.781]  When you take that oath, that's where your decision is made.
[01:41:38.781 --> 01:41:40.622]  Right there on that spot.
[01:41:40.622 --> 01:41:47.747]  You pledge, you swear to God Almighty, that you're going to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[01:41:47.747 --> 01:41:49.848]  At all costs.
[01:41:49.848 --> 01:41:52.670]  All of us who served in the military and police, this is our bond.
[01:41:52.670 --> 01:41:54.031]  And firefighters too.
[01:41:54.031 --> 01:41:57.353]  When we say those words, it's not just something we say.
[01:41:58.277 --> 01:42:08.602]  We know that it means we're writing a blank check made out to the people of the United States for an amount up to and including our lives.
[01:42:08.602 --> 01:42:09.983]  That's the difference.
[01:42:09.983 --> 01:42:11.284]  You want to know the difference?
[01:42:11.284 --> 01:42:12.865]  That's it.
[01:42:12.865 --> 01:42:17.087]  When a firefighter goes into a burning building, he knows he might not come out.
[01:42:17.087 --> 01:42:18.948]  But he's duty-bound to do it.
[01:42:18.948 --> 01:42:20.809]  He took upon himself that responsibility.
[01:42:23.297 --> 01:42:26.778]  I served as a volunteer firefighter in Montana only for about eight months.
[01:42:26.778 --> 01:42:27.798]  I was just a rookie.
[01:42:27.798 --> 01:42:33.599]  But I'll tell you what, I saw some men of true character and courage.
[01:42:33.599 --> 01:42:38.440]  Those are the guys that run in when everybody else is running out.
[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:42.361]  That's the pure spirit of a Guardian, who's willing to sacrifice his life.
[01:42:42.361 --> 01:42:45.382]  Okay?
[01:42:45.382 --> 01:42:46.822]  Sadly enough, though, in this country,
[01:42:48.015 --> 01:42:50.716]  People respect firefighters, they still understand that.
[01:42:50.716 --> 01:42:52.577]  That they're heroes.
[01:42:52.577 --> 01:42:54.197]  They really are.
[01:42:54.197 --> 01:42:59.199]  But all too often nowadays, they look at police and they don't see heroes anymore.
[01:42:59.199 --> 01:43:02.140]  They look at them and they think, these are the people that are going to come kick down my door.
[01:43:03.069 --> 01:43:06.450]  These are the guys that are going to arrest me and tase me on some traffic stop.
[01:43:06.450 --> 01:43:10.671]  These are the guys I see on YouTube doing things like tasing some old lady.
[01:43:10.671 --> 01:43:18.693]  Or like during Katrina, tackling an old lady to the ground in her kitchen because she dares to hold a revolver in her hand with the cylinder open.
[01:43:18.693 --> 01:43:20.333]  Obviously no danger to anybody.
[01:43:20.333 --> 01:43:26.895]  Any idiot that understands guns whatsoever should know that an open cylinder, an empty cylinder, is no danger.
[01:43:26.895 --> 01:43:28.516]  What is she going to do, speed load it in two seconds?
[01:43:30.799 --> 01:43:39.081]  They see these things, and they start to see the police in this country as the enemy of the people, as an occupying army.
[01:43:39.081 --> 01:43:47.703]  There are all too many people in this country, sincere lovers of liberty, sincere constitutionalists, who are becoming increasingly afraid of their own police officers.
[01:43:47.703 --> 01:43:50.284]  I find that sad.
[01:43:50.284 --> 01:43:51.224]  I find that tragic.
[01:43:52.148 --> 01:43:55.030]  And I find it contemptible, because you know where it's coming from?
[01:43:55.030 --> 01:44:00.575]  There are people who want to put a divide, a wall, between the police in this country and the people.
[01:44:00.575 --> 01:44:03.037]  They're doing this intentionally.
[01:44:03.037 --> 01:44:12.766]  All these, the MIAC report, the Fusion Center report from Missouri, had labeled just about everybody, the Constitution Party, a supporter of Chuck Baldwin, potential terrorist.
[01:44:12.766 --> 01:44:15.348]  A supporter of Ron Paul, potential terrorist.
[01:44:15.348 --> 01:44:16.649]  Kind of like the Emmys awards, you know?
[01:44:17.901 --> 01:44:20.763]  A supporter of immigration control.
[01:44:20.763 --> 01:44:22.424]  Potential terrorist.
[01:44:22.424 --> 01:44:29.629]  And was one of the police officers in Missouri who saw that and said, hey, I don't like being called a potential terrorist.
[01:44:29.629 --> 01:44:31.971]  And so that police officer leaked it.
[01:44:31.971 --> 01:44:36.534]  And the same goes for the DHS report that smeared veterans as potential terrorists.
[01:44:36.534 --> 01:44:39.116]  That was also leaked by a federal officer.
[01:44:39.116 --> 01:44:39.777]  Very good man.
[01:44:41.301 --> 01:44:59.091]  And in addition, same with the extremist lexicon, was also leaked by a federal officer who did not like the pattern he saw of this wall separation, of this attempt to make police officers think that the people are their enemy.
[01:44:59.091 --> 01:45:08.176]  So they pull you over, in their mind you're a potential enemy, especially if you have a Ron Paul sticker on your car, a constitutional sticker on your car, what's the other one, live free or die?
[01:45:08.176 --> 01:45:10.758]  What's the one guy he had a sticker on his car that got hassled?
[01:45:13.305 --> 01:45:20.787]  Glass in the flag, got pulled over, and a police officer, sadly enough, told the reason why he pulled you over is because of that bumper sticker on your car.
[01:45:20.787 --> 01:45:23.568]  That's a piece of American history right there.
[01:45:23.568 --> 01:45:27.129]  This is the flag of our fathers.
[01:45:27.129 --> 01:45:31.750]  Our forefathers flew this flag as they gave their lives.
[01:45:33.274 --> 01:45:35.015]  For our liberty.
[01:45:35.015 --> 01:45:48.926]  And yet this flag now is seen as a sign of a terrorist, of a lawbreaker, of an enemy of the people, of a killer of women and children.
[01:45:48.926 --> 01:45:50.247]  Contemptible.
[01:45:50.247 --> 01:45:58.613]  There are people in this country who do not respect our Republic, do not support the Constitution, who desire to destroy this Republic.
[01:45:59.540 --> 01:46:03.563]  And they are doing all they can to erase our heritage.
[01:46:03.563 --> 01:46:09.408]  To make it off-limits to dare to fly this flag.
[01:46:09.408 --> 01:46:18.976]  To make it off-limits to dare to stand elected in green and simply renew the oath you swore by legal obligation.
[01:46:18.976 --> 01:46:22.098]  They want it off-limits for you to celebrate your heritage.
[01:46:22.098 --> 01:46:25.301]  To even talk about the Constitution.
[01:46:25.301 --> 01:46:26.902]  To even call yourself a constitutionalist.
[01:46:27.932 --> 01:46:34.454]  I saw that the DHS lexicon that says constitutionalist equals militiaman equals extremist equals terrorist.
[01:46:34.454 --> 01:46:37.476]  I thought, oh my gosh, I've been calling myself a constitutionalist for years!
[01:46:37.476 --> 01:46:38.036]  I didn't know!
[01:46:38.036 --> 01:46:42.157]  I had no idea I was extremist!
[01:46:42.157 --> 01:46:44.218]  What a revelation!
[01:46:44.218 --> 01:46:46.959]  Or a terrorist, yeah.
[01:46:46.959 --> 01:46:49.900]  There's a conscious effort to put a divide between the police and the people.
[01:46:49.900 --> 01:46:53.642]  They want the police to see you as the enemy, they want you to see the police as the enemy.
[01:46:53.642 --> 01:46:55.322]  Is that true?
[01:46:55.322 --> 01:46:56.043]  Is that the truth?
[01:46:57.009 --> 01:46:57.849]  No.
[01:46:57.849 --> 01:47:00.070]  It's like the Matrix in that movie.
[01:47:00.070 --> 01:47:02.031]  It's false.
[01:47:02.031 --> 01:47:03.772]  It's balderdash.
[01:47:03.772 --> 01:47:05.632]  It's nonsense.
[01:47:05.632 --> 01:47:05.973]  Okay?
[01:47:05.973 --> 01:47:12.815]  And this is one of the big, I'll tell you what, I started this organization, I already knew there were good police officers out there.
[01:47:12.815 --> 01:47:19.258]  I'd been a fire instructor and met quite a few of them here in Metro in the past, and gone to shooting schools with them.
[01:47:19.258 --> 01:47:21.619]  Thunder Ranch, you know, gun site, whatever.
[01:47:21.619 --> 01:47:22.999]  Had a good time.
[01:47:22.999 --> 01:47:24.740]  And I recognized that there was that bond.
[01:47:25.555 --> 01:47:28.155]  There's a bond between military and police.
[01:47:28.155 --> 01:47:30.456]  Shouldn't be a surprise.
[01:47:30.456 --> 01:47:39.958]  They're all willing to put on a rifle, sling a rifle, put on a pistol, and go do what has to be done to defend their country, and their neighborhoods, and their friends and neighbors, and their families.
[01:47:39.958 --> 01:47:41.218]  They take that responsibility.
[01:47:41.218 --> 01:47:43.418]  They're warriors.
[01:47:43.418 --> 01:47:44.679]  It's that common bond.
[01:47:44.679 --> 01:47:49.880]  Others who've stepped up for active duty, and even us veterans, frankly, who dare to stand up.
[01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:52.220]  Don't you think I'm putting a big bullseye on my forehead by doing this?
[01:47:53.573 --> 01:47:54.994]  I'm not exaggerating.
[01:47:54.994 --> 01:48:02.581]  When Southern Poverty Law Center does all their smear stuff, are they just saying that to be mean and be nasty and maybe a libel suit will come out of it?
[01:48:02.581 --> 01:48:03.321]  No.
[01:48:03.321 --> 01:48:05.143]  It's potentially deadly.
[01:48:05.143 --> 01:48:14.290]  They want the FBI, DOJ, ATF to come and investigate people like me.
[01:48:15.114 --> 01:48:16.734]  That's their purpose.
[01:48:16.734 --> 01:48:18.815]  Smear you and marginalize you.
[01:48:18.815 --> 01:48:22.336]  And then, hopefully, unleash the power of government against you.
[01:48:22.336 --> 01:48:24.796]  To silence and suppress you.
[01:48:24.796 --> 01:48:27.777]  They want them to come kick down my door in Mullah Night.
[01:48:27.777 --> 01:48:28.937]  In body armor.
[01:48:28.937 --> 01:48:31.538]  They want guys like me to come to my house.
[01:48:31.538 --> 01:48:33.258]  They're not gonna come do it.
[01:48:33.258 --> 01:48:37.980]  Is Mark Potok gonna come to my house?
[01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:39.720]  In body armor and baklava?
[01:48:41.297 --> 01:48:48.545]  And with an MP5 in his hand and kicked down my door, use a battery ram and come through my door, is he going to be point man behind the ram?
[01:48:48.545 --> 01:48:49.466]  No!
[01:48:49.466 --> 01:48:52.770]  He won't come do it himself!
[01:48:52.770 --> 01:48:55.573]  He'll send someone like Chauncey.
[01:48:55.573 --> 01:48:58.997]  Or someone like Dave Freeman.
[01:48:58.997 --> 01:49:00.799]  Or someone like Bob back there.
[01:49:00.799 --> 01:49:01.560]  Big strong guy.
[01:49:02.642 --> 01:49:10.465]  He wants someone like that to come to my house and kick in my door and put a submachine gun in my face and my children's face.
[01:49:10.465 --> 01:49:12.985]  That's what he wants.
[01:49:12.985 --> 01:49:15.626]  He wants them to think that I'm their enemy.
[01:49:15.626 --> 01:49:17.127]  And vice versa.
[01:49:17.127 --> 01:49:18.887]  He wants all of us to think that.
[01:49:18.887 --> 01:49:20.428]  And then they expect.
[01:49:20.428 --> 01:49:22.869]  Why are they upset about us?
[01:49:22.869 --> 01:49:24.949]  It's not because we're not racist.
[01:49:24.949 --> 01:49:25.630]  It's not that.
[01:49:25.630 --> 01:49:26.950]  They know it too.
[01:49:26.950 --> 01:49:29.891]  It's not because we're terrorists celebrating Timothy McVeigh.
[01:49:29.891 --> 01:49:31.992]  What they're upset about is the oath.
[01:49:33.151 --> 01:49:39.712]  They don't like it when what they perceive as their minions and their toys even think for themselves.
[01:49:39.712 --> 01:49:49.095]  Their vision, their perspective, their opinion of the police and military is that they're just like toy soldiers who wind up instead of marching.
[01:49:49.095 --> 01:49:58.717]  And they think, because they don't believe in a republic, they believe in this absolute rule, whoever holds political power, they believe we're a democracy.
[01:49:58.717 --> 01:49:59.797]  There are people in this country
[01:50:01.513 --> 01:50:05.654]  When they hold political power, they figure, hey, I won the election, all the toys belong to me.
[01:50:05.654 --> 01:50:07.875]  That includes the police and military.
[01:50:07.875 --> 01:50:08.575]  They're my toys.
[01:50:08.575 --> 01:50:10.196]  They do what I want with.
[01:50:10.196 --> 01:50:13.357]  And how dare you interfere with my toys!
[01:50:13.357 --> 01:50:16.898]  They're a little chance for a little kid crying and screaming in a sandbox.
[01:50:16.898 --> 01:50:18.879]  Don't touch my toys!
[01:50:18.879 --> 01:50:25.621]  Don't remind those men and women of honor and courage, their obligations under the law.
[01:50:25.621 --> 01:50:29.443]  Don't you dare talk to them about their individual responsibility
[01:50:30.458 --> 01:50:31.999]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:31.999 --> 01:50:32.379]  Stay with us.
[01:51:01.377 --> 01:51:02.678]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.678 --> 01:51:08.281]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:08.281 --> 01:51:13.283]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.283 --> 01:51:18.326]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:18.866 --> 01:51:24.090]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:24.090 --> 01:51:26.391]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:51:26.391 --> 01:51:31.194]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:31.194 --> 01:51:32.315]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:32.315 --> 01:51:35.377]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:35.377 --> 01:51:39.020]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:39.020 --> 01:51:42.202]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[01:51:51.949 --> 01:51:58.055]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.

[01:53:02.877 --> 01:53:04.618]  What is a wind generator?
[01:53:04.618 --> 01:53:07.040]  How can the wind produce power for a small cabin?
[01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:10.383]  How can wind energy be stored and used during an emergency?
[01:53:10.383 --> 01:53:12.325]  Can I assemble my own wind generator?

[01:54:20.319 --> 01:54:21.480]  This is not America.
[01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:26.965]  Foreign offshore banks stealing tens of trillions of dollars.
[01:54:26.965 --> 01:54:33.630]  Five plus trillion missing from the Pentagon the last time they had a congressional hearing five years ago.
[01:54:33.630 --> 01:54:36.373]  It was 2.3 trillion in 2001.
[01:54:36.373 --> 01:54:37.454]  This is not America.
[01:54:37.454 --> 01:54:46.722]  Face scanning cameras, checkpoints, naked body scanners, all these illegal wars, all the taxes, government-run health care, federalized police,
[01:54:48.459 --> 01:54:53.141]  The military openly announcing that they are operating on domestic soil.
[01:54:53.141 --> 01:54:59.244]  Remember that Fox News piece out of New York where, oh, several thousand arrests aided by the National Guard.
[01:54:59.244 --> 01:55:02.945]  Oh, they have x-ray machines they put your cars through now.
[01:55:02.945 --> 01:55:11.569]  Oh, the SWAT teams are over in Iraq, regular police departments like Austin, training for gun confiscation and checkpoints and door-to-door confiscation.
[01:55:13.308 --> 01:55:15.548]  This is not America.
[01:55:15.548 --> 01:55:17.189]  This is not freedom.
[01:55:17.189 --> 01:55:18.609]  This is not liberty.
[01:55:18.609 --> 01:55:21.650]  This is 180 degrees the opposite direction.
[01:55:21.650 --> 01:55:22.910]  We're being looted.
[01:55:22.910 --> 01:55:25.551]  We're being robbed right now.
[01:55:25.551 --> 01:55:26.791]  What do you think tyranny is about?
[01:55:26.791 --> 01:55:29.231]  So many yuppies say, I don't care if it's tyranny.
[01:55:29.231 --> 01:55:30.552]  They don't care about me.
[01:55:30.552 --> 01:55:32.452]  Tyranny is for you.
[01:55:32.452 --> 01:55:41.834]  Tyranny is to take your pension funds and raise your taxes and have national compulsory service where the state uses your children like slaves and they've reintroduced the bill
[01:55:42.654 --> 01:55:42.754]  Yeah.
[01:56:00.379 --> 01:56:07.903]  Corporate spies with the highest level security clearance, spying on the American people, part of InfraGard and other programs.
[01:56:07.903 --> 01:56:09.604]  How many years ago did I tell you that was going on?
[01:56:09.604 --> 01:56:12.245]  That a secret private corporate takeover was happening?
[01:56:12.245 --> 01:56:13.566]  That there were spies everywhere?
[01:56:13.566 --> 01:56:16.788]  Because I'd seen intel pieces all over the place.
[01:56:16.788 --> 01:56:18.309]  This is all admitted!
[01:56:18.309 --> 01:56:21.430]  And now it's out in the open!
[01:56:21.430 --> 01:56:28.634]  They're not getting 854,000 private spies with the highest level security clearances with license to kill orders.
[01:56:28.634 --> 01:56:29.535]  That's mainstream news.
[01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:35.845]  They're not setting all this up to play patty cake with you.
[01:56:35.845 --> 01:56:37.447]  Our government's become corrupt.
[01:56:37.447 --> 01:56:42.574]  Since 47, the CIA and the NSA have operated in total secrecy with unlimited funding.
[01:56:42.574 --> 01:56:45.137]  They've been caught shipping drugs in over and over again.
[01:56:45.137 --> 01:56:46.799]  They're totally corrupt.
[01:56:46.799 --> 01:56:49.723]  If you owned a business as the American people, you run America.
[01:56:52.116 --> 01:56:56.559]  And you went away from your business for 20 years and gave somebody the keys to everything.
[01:56:56.559 --> 01:57:00.822]  Do you think when you came back in 20 years that they thought you had been lost at sea or something?
[01:57:00.822 --> 01:57:04.585]  That they'd lock the doors when you got there and tell the cops to arrest you?
[01:57:04.585 --> 01:57:07.767]  And that they'd tell everybody the business was theirs?
[01:57:07.767 --> 01:57:09.508]  That's what's happened!
[01:57:09.508 --> 01:57:11.490]  The country is dying!
[01:57:11.490 --> 01:57:15.573]  Liberty is the engine of wealth and happiness.
[01:57:17.486 --> 01:57:23.251]  We need a sanctuary, that's what our republic was, for private property, for freedom.
[01:57:23.251 --> 01:57:26.214]  And we're losing that sanctuary.
[01:57:26.214 --> 01:57:29.997]  We're losing that hedge of protection.
[01:57:29.997 --> 01:57:38.044]  Nigeria's got, on average, as many resources as the United States, but their 300 million inhabitants are slaves.
[01:57:38.044 --> 01:57:42.328]  Mexico's got at least triple the resources in every graph you look at.
[01:57:43.154 --> 01:57:46.856]  And every demographic you look at, but they're totally poor because they have a corrupt elite.
[01:57:46.856 --> 01:57:48.517]  But they have more billionaires than the U.S.
[01:57:48.517 --> 01:57:49.078]  does.
[01:57:49.078 --> 01:57:51.299]  They have an ultra-rich and a giant poor.
[01:57:51.299 --> 01:57:56.362]  They use the fact that their population is poor by design to control them.
[01:57:56.362 --> 01:57:57.783]  This is feudalism.
[01:57:57.783 --> 01:57:58.944]  Neo-serfdom.
[01:58:01.482 --> 01:58:03.564]  The bad guys have taken America over.
[01:58:03.564 --> 01:58:05.146]  America isn't bad.
[01:58:05.146 --> 01:58:10.351]  The bad guys took it over because we were the freest country in the world, so we had all the wealth and power.
[01:58:10.351 --> 01:58:18.999]  So private corporate interests came in, took over the government, and have set up an ultra-massive tyranny.
[01:58:18.999 --> 01:58:21.601]  I want to clear the phone banks right now, because...
[01:58:23.015 --> 01:58:23.595]  You know what I'll do?
[01:58:23.595 --> 01:58:34.304]  I'll talk to these callers that are on hold, but then after that, I want to specifically open the phones up for police and military who've been trained in Iraq for martial law here domestically.
[01:58:34.304 --> 01:58:43.210]  So we'll take a bunch of calls, and then I'm going to leave the phones open until Chuck Baldwin joins us for the military and police.
[01:58:43.210 --> 01:58:45.832]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.832 --> 01:58:48.755]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.385 --> 01:58:54.228]  Thousands of Americans are facing evacuation.
[01:58:54.228 --> 01:58:59.532]  If you or any of your loved ones might need to evacuate, you must do it yourselves.
[01:58:59.532 --> 01:59:02.335]  Please don't procrastinate until they do it for you.
[01:59:02.335 --> 01:59:05.998]  Remember the terrible conditions of those that didn't get out for Katrina.
[01:59:05.998 --> 01:59:12.023]  Go right now to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex or call 800-409-5633 for information on the new evacuation pack.
[01:59:16.187 --> 01:59:21.628]  It contains two weeks of delicious easy-to-fix food along with the equipment to prepare it.
[01:59:21.628 --> 01:59:24.709]  It's packed in a rugged heavy-duty tote for transport.
[01:59:24.709 --> 01:59:29.090]  Evacuations are looming with the storms and the Gulf oil catastrophe.
[01:59:29.090 --> 01:59:34.431]  No matter where you live, wildfires, earthquakes, floods, and storms must be escaped.
[01:59:34.431 --> 01:59:37.972]  Don't be like a deer frozen in the headlights of oncoming disaster.
[01:59:38.272 --> 01:59:43.334]  At least prepare yourself with this two-week evacuation pack from efoodsdirect.com.
[01:59:43.334 --> 01:59:44.294]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:59:44.294 --> 01:59:53.937]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com slash alex.
[01:59:53.937 --> 01:59:56.358]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.358 --> 01:59:59.119]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.851 --> 02:00:07.171]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.171 --> 02:00:08.932]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.932 --> 02:00:10.693]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.693 --> 02:00:12.273]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.273 --> 02:00:13.834]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.834 --> 02:00:18.015]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.015 --> 02:00:22.077]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.801 --> 02:00:27.443]  I'm going to take the group of calls that are holding right now.
[02:00:27.443 --> 02:00:31.065]  Then the phones are only open until Chuck Baldwin joins us.
[02:00:31.065 --> 02:00:43.253]  If you are in the military and have trained police for gun confiscation and checkpoints, or vice versa, and the fact that the Austin SWAT team is training for martial law, lockdowns of cities, checkpoints.
[02:00:44.053 --> 02:00:56.938]  Now this is all admitted in the Army Times as well, but it's just, it's so incredible to realize this treason is going on and they're all macho in a military attitude and being militarily trained to kill people and break things here domestically.
[02:00:56.938 --> 02:00:57.939]  So that is coming up.
[02:00:57.939 --> 02:00:59.259]  Let's go to your calls quickly.
[02:00:59.259 --> 02:01:00.880]  Jack in South Dakota, you're on the air.
[02:01:01.772 --> 02:01:02.493]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:01:02.493 --> 02:01:03.834]  Hello?
[02:01:03.834 --> 02:01:04.654]  Yes, sir.
[02:01:04.654 --> 02:01:07.016]  Yeah, you know how you always say knowledge is power?
[02:01:07.016 --> 02:01:08.017]  Yes.
[02:01:08.017 --> 02:01:09.678]  Knowledge is not power.
[02:01:09.678 --> 02:01:10.959]  Courage is power.
[02:01:10.959 --> 02:01:13.821]  If you have all the knowledge in the world, you're in a coward.
[02:01:13.821 --> 02:01:14.662]  You have nothing.
[02:01:14.662 --> 02:01:15.803]  Well, you gotta have both.
[02:01:15.803 --> 02:01:16.203]  Courage.
[02:01:16.203 --> 02:01:17.364]  You gotta have courage.
[02:01:17.364 --> 02:01:18.325]  And it comes from God.
[02:01:18.325 --> 02:01:19.165]  You can't buy it.
[02:01:19.165 --> 02:01:21.227]  You can't steal it.
[02:01:21.227 --> 02:01:22.548]  And listen, another thing.
[02:01:22.548 --> 02:01:24.930]  That thorn in your side and why you're shaking in the shower?
[02:01:25.630 --> 02:01:28.032]  Is that real ID card you're carrying, Alex?
[02:01:28.032 --> 02:01:31.415]  You have to take that out of your wallet, go down and get a copy.
[02:01:31.415 --> 02:01:34.718]  Carry a paper copy of it, if that's what gives you courage.
[02:01:34.718 --> 02:01:36.639]  Do not carry real ID.
[02:01:36.639 --> 02:01:42.504]  Real ID, without that, without real ID, they cannot do healthcare, they cannot do this banking system.
[02:01:43.104 --> 02:01:46.027]  You've got to use your weapons back on them.
[02:01:46.027 --> 02:01:50.132]  When I said that, it was more of a shudder of just realizing how real this is.
[02:01:50.132 --> 02:01:56.719]  It isn't even fear, it's more of a revulsion that the population doesn't know what's happening to them.
[02:01:56.719 --> 02:01:59.582]  And I agree, you've got to have knowledge and courage.
[02:01:59.582 --> 02:02:04.828]  But if you've just got courage, you'll be manipulated to work for the New World Order thinking you're a good guy if you don't have knowledge.
[02:02:05.981 --> 02:02:10.362]  If you don't file, you stand with courage and let them put the penalties on you and pay them later.
[02:02:10.362 --> 02:02:13.363]  It's worth the price to have the courage.
[02:02:29.204 --> 02:02:31.887]  Them are Freemasons with a badge, dude.
[02:02:31.887 --> 02:02:34.890]  That is World Global Freemasonry with a badge.
[02:02:34.890 --> 02:02:36.012]  Do you understand me?
[02:02:36.012 --> 02:02:41.898]  Well, I have noticed it's a lot of Masons they're recruiting into these positions, and it's the Masons... They are all Freemasons, Alex.
[02:02:41.898 --> 02:02:43.420]  They are all the work of the devil.
[02:02:43.420 --> 02:02:46.884]  Listen, prayer is the only weapon against the devil.
[02:02:47.624 --> 02:02:49.546]  Alright Alex, how are you doing?
[02:03:09.039 --> 02:03:10.980]  Yeah, I was talking about the Freemasons.
[02:03:10.980 --> 02:03:15.061]  One of my friend's brother-in-law is like third in line in the Reading Police Department.
[02:03:15.061 --> 02:03:17.162]  He's a Freemason and all that, supposedly.
[02:03:17.162 --> 02:03:22.744]  Well, if they claim they're all for liberty and freedom, this isn't liberty and freedom they're setting up.
[02:03:22.744 --> 02:03:25.865]  So yeah, the Masons have got a big problem.
[02:03:25.865 --> 02:03:28.786]  Yeah, so I wanted to bring two points up that you were talking about yesterday.
[02:03:28.786 --> 02:03:32.748]  About people looking at you all weird when you bring up the Constitution and stuff like that.
[02:03:33.311 --> 02:03:33.591]  Yes.
[02:03:33.591 --> 02:03:34.791]  I have a chiropractor.
[02:03:34.791 --> 02:03:36.372]  He's a really intelligent guy.
[02:03:36.372 --> 02:03:39.533]  Every time I bring it up, oh, you're one of those Constitution guys, huh?
[02:03:39.533 --> 02:03:40.973]  Yeah, which means you're an American.
[02:03:40.973 --> 02:03:45.755]  I mean, this is just more dirt if we don't have the Bill of Rights and Constitution Declaration of Independence.
[02:03:45.755 --> 02:03:48.095]  Might as well just be Nigeria or Venezuela.
[02:03:48.095 --> 02:03:49.856]  You know, that's what America is.
[02:03:49.856 --> 02:03:51.536]  That's what the flag symbolizes.
[02:03:51.536 --> 02:03:54.637]  And they hate the Gadsden flag.
[02:03:54.637 --> 02:03:55.678]  Don't tread on me.
[02:03:55.678 --> 02:03:59.899]  They hate the Constitution because these people at their roots hate freedom.
[02:04:00.879 --> 02:04:02.900]  Yeah, it's very, very frustrating.
[02:04:02.900 --> 02:04:05.642]  And then also, you were talking about how they like to play God.
[02:04:05.642 --> 02:04:11.385]  Well, I have somebody really close to me who works on all the power lines, and it brings him to military bases.
[02:04:11.385 --> 02:04:23.853]  And one time he went there, there was two people guarding this one area that he couldn't go into, and one of these guys said that it was one of the biggest magnets in the world, and they didn't know what it was going to do when they turned that on.
[02:04:23.853 --> 02:04:28.416]  They didn't know if it was going to throw our orbit off or anything like that, and they still turned it on.
[02:04:28.416 --> 02:04:29.677]  Obviously, it didn't do anything, but...
[02:04:30.177 --> 02:04:31.939]  You saying that was what you learned?
[02:04:31.939 --> 02:04:32.059]  Yeah.
[02:04:46.656 --> 02:04:47.337]  All of it.
[02:04:47.337 --> 02:04:48.398]  Really great points, Nate.
[02:04:48.398 --> 02:04:53.723]  I'm going to talk to Frank, Karen, and Randy quickly, but now there's some phone lines open for police and military.
[02:04:53.723 --> 02:04:59.348]  What do you think about the Austin SWAT team being trained for gun confiscation and coordinating shutting down cities?
[02:04:59.348 --> 02:05:00.189]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:01.144 --> 02:05:06.107]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:05:06.107 --> 02:05:07.108]  What have we got?
[02:05:07.108 --> 02:05:09.549]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:05:09.549 --> 02:05:10.570]  A republic.
[02:05:10.570 --> 02:05:13.212]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:05:13.212 --> 02:05:15.473]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:05:15.473 --> 02:05:17.494]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:05:17.494 --> 02:05:19.175]  So they think they own our land?
[02:05:19.175 --> 02:05:20.496]  They think they own our water?
[02:05:20.496 --> 02:05:21.116]  Children?
[02:05:21.116 --> 02:05:22.217]  Our education?
[02:05:22.217 --> 02:05:23.058]  Our money?
[02:05:23.058 --> 02:05:26.700]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:05:27.080 --> 02:05:32.067]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:05:32.067 --> 02:05:33.068]  We have the facts.
[02:05:33.068 --> 02:05:34.230]  We have the Constitution.
[02:05:34.230 --> 02:05:35.131]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:05:35.131 --> 02:05:36.032]  We have common law.
[02:05:36.032 --> 02:05:38.556]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:05:38.556 --> 02:05:42.321]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:05:42.421 --> 02:05:47.384]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:05:47.384 --> 02:05:48.885]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:05:48.885 --> 02:05:49.965]  Don't tread on me.
[02:05:49.965 --> 02:05:56.829]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:06:00.911 --> 02:06:05.455]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:05.455 --> 02:06:06.375]  Number 1.
[02:06:06.375 --> 02:06:09.798]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:09.798 --> 02:06:10.659]  Number 2.
[02:06:10.659 --> 02:06:15.563]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:15.563 --> 02:06:16.303]  It's true.
[02:06:16.303 --> 02:06:21.167]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:21.167 --> 02:06:22.008]  Number 3.
[02:06:22.008 --> 02:06:25.591]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:25.591 --> 02:06:29.294]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:29.474 --> 02:06:30.275]  Number 4.
[02:06:30.275 --> 02:06:33.037]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:33.037 --> 02:06:36.721]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:36.721 --> 02:06:37.502]  Number 5.
[02:06:37.502 --> 02:06:41.665]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:41.665 --> 02:06:46.710]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:07:55.647 --> 02:07:56.107]  Thank you!
[02:08:02.028 --> 02:08:08.063]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[02:08:08.063 --> 02:08:10.589]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:08:12.827 --> 02:08:16.868]  We are keeping a few phone lines open for police and military.
[02:08:16.868 --> 02:08:19.189]  It's on record all over the news.
[02:08:19.189 --> 02:08:24.391]  They're training for domestic takeovers, domestic disturbances, gun confiscation.
[02:08:24.391 --> 02:08:28.712]  But I want to hear from you specifically about what you think about this.
[02:08:28.712 --> 02:08:29.873]  We're leaving a few lines open.
[02:08:29.873 --> 02:08:39.676]  In fact, Mike from Texas, who's at Fort Hood, who called in and gave us this intel that was confirmed in a newspaper about the Austin SWAT team training for martial law.
[02:08:40.703 --> 02:08:40.763]  I'm
[02:08:59.957 --> 02:09:00.097]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:09:00.097 --> 02:09:00.257]  800-259-9231.
[02:09:00.257 --> 02:09:02.098]  Chuck Baldwin's coming up in about 25 minutes.
[02:09:02.098 --> 02:09:03.259]  Right now, let's go back to your calls.
[02:09:03.259 --> 02:09:04.880]  Frank in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:09:14.554 --> 02:09:19.735]  God might have been speaking to you in the shower, so I'll be praying for you and your safety more often.
[02:09:19.735 --> 02:09:24.576]  I listen to you every day now, but I used to be a right-winger who believed that Muslims were our enemy.
[02:09:24.576 --> 02:09:32.518]  I was for the war, but I got completely woke up because of seeing 9-11 truth videos on YouTube, and this was over a year ago.
[02:09:32.518 --> 02:09:35.799]  And since then, I've given out DVDs to all my friends and family.
[02:09:35.799 --> 02:09:38.320]  I've posted links in Facebook.
[02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:43.421]  The links from the Alex Jones Channel are excellent, but the problem is that everyone just ignores it.
[02:09:43.982 --> 02:09:45.402]  I never get any response.
[02:09:45.402 --> 02:09:47.623]  The people are too cowardly to watch the videos.
[02:09:47.623 --> 02:09:51.864]  The Facebookers just want to talk about complete nonsense and ignore the links.
[02:09:51.864 --> 02:09:53.465]  It makes me sick!
[02:09:53.465 --> 02:09:58.907]  And now the right-wingers are all upset about some supposed mosque being built on Ground Zero.
[02:09:58.907 --> 02:10:05.889]  As far as I'm concerned, it's just a total distraction to keep these people from, you know, focusing on the bankers and keep them focused on Islam.
[02:10:05.889 --> 02:10:13.151]  And they're worried about a mosque, and I think it goes hand-in-hand with the official story, which is a conspiracy theory.
[02:10:13.726 --> 02:10:17.034]  If anyone wants to call us truthers, conspiracy theorists, no.
[02:10:17.034 --> 02:10:18.719]  It's the people who believe the official...
[02:10:20.622 --> 02:10:27.267]  Well, listen, the majority of Americans in major polls say that they don't trust either political party, and it's that awakening.
[02:10:27.267 --> 02:10:32.631]  Democrats are waking up, Republicans are waking up, and saying, I don't believe anything this government tells us.
[02:10:32.631 --> 02:10:36.594]  And it's that awakening to the criminality that gives us a chance to reverse this.
[02:10:36.594 --> 02:10:42.559]  But people have woken up, but they haven't woken up to one one-hundredth, most of them, of just how bad it really is.
[02:10:42.559 --> 02:10:44.300]  I appreciate your call, Frank.
[02:10:44.300 --> 02:10:46.062]  Karen in California, you're on the air.
[02:10:48.181 --> 02:11:00.838]  You're waking us up in California, and I'm a mother of five kids, the youngest is 18, and I grew up in a military family, and we have three months to get ready for this war, so we need to fight and get ourselves ready and get it united.
[02:11:01.252 --> 02:11:02.933]  And say, um, a lot of voices be heard.
[02:11:02.933 --> 02:11:05.735]  Short of majority of American people don't want this war.
[02:11:05.735 --> 02:11:08.076]  And we need to do it now.
[02:11:08.076 --> 02:11:10.357]  Well, and we may back them off.
[02:11:10.357 --> 02:11:15.580]  And we may back them off from launching an attack, but then the globalists may set a nuke off and blame it on foreign enemies.
[02:11:15.580 --> 02:11:18.602]  As long as they can stage crises and get more power out of it.
[02:11:19.042 --> 02:11:23.627]  You know, what did Obama's advisor, Robert Shapiro, say in the Financial Times of London two weeks ago?
[02:11:23.627 --> 02:11:29.894]  He said, Obama needs an Oklahoma City or 9-11 event so he can look strong, and if he doesn't have that, it's over for him.
[02:11:29.894 --> 02:11:31.676]  That's a paraphrase, but he basically said that.
[02:11:31.676 --> 02:11:35.019]  In fact, let's pull up the quote and put it on screen.
[02:11:35.019 --> 02:11:37.081]  It was a Financial Times of London headline, but...
[02:11:38.106 --> 02:11:38.306]  I agree.
[02:11:38.306 --> 02:11:39.407]  We also need to show our flags.
[02:11:39.407 --> 02:11:41.269]  We need to start putting our flags back up.
[02:12:08.424 --> 02:12:21.454]  Well, we're seeing massive censorship on Facebook and at people's houses and other places with the Gadsden flag, the don't tread on me, that George Washington used, that the Marine Corps uses.
[02:12:21.454 --> 02:12:24.476]  What's wrong with an American saying, don't tread on me, I'm not a slave?
[02:12:24.476 --> 02:12:29.540]  That upsets the globalists because they think they own the police, they own the military, they own the people.
[02:12:29.540 --> 02:12:31.642]  We've got to say, no, you don't own me.
[02:12:31.642 --> 02:12:32.763]  I mean, they've got an...
[02:12:33.143 --> 02:12:37.887]  In fact, will you guys print me Rob Dew's article about National Slave Bill, Interest Committee?
[02:12:37.887 --> 02:12:39.428]  I think that was the Infowars headline.
[02:12:39.428 --> 02:12:42.591]  That bill is introduced for national forced service.
[02:12:42.591 --> 02:12:44.912]  I appreciate your call, Karen.
[02:12:44.912 --> 02:12:47.434]  Let's talk to John in Oklahoma who's police.
[02:12:47.434 --> 02:12:49.696]  John, thanks for joining us.
[02:12:49.696 --> 02:12:50.897]  Yes, sir.
[02:12:50.897 --> 02:13:00.605]  What's your take on the military training with the police for cordon and search and shutdown of cities and gun confiscation like we saw in Katrina?
[02:13:01.732 --> 02:13:06.994]  Well, I think it's an obvious violation of the Constitution.
[02:13:06.994 --> 02:13:09.395]  You can't do that.
[02:13:09.395 --> 02:13:15.157]  It's an obvious... I mean, isn't there something called posse comitatus?
[02:13:15.157 --> 02:13:16.537]  Well, they've blown holes in it.
[02:13:16.537 --> 02:13:19.378]  We can't do that.
[02:13:19.378 --> 02:13:20.339]  Absolutely.
[02:13:20.339 --> 02:13:22.579]  I mean, what's your view as a police officer?
[02:13:22.579 --> 02:13:24.280]  What are the other police saying?
[02:13:24.280 --> 02:13:26.921]  Are they aware of the transformation taking place?
[02:13:28.871 --> 02:13:42.053]  From what I can tell, at least where I work, there's not a lot of people that know what's going on, but every once in a while I do run into one during training and so on and so forth.
[02:13:42.053 --> 02:13:47.835]  Well, what about a military culture being taught to police, which is go out there and fight the enemy?
[02:13:47.835 --> 02:13:48.715]  Well, that's just it.
[02:13:48.715 --> 02:13:50.575]  I believe that's where it's coming from.
[02:13:50.575 --> 02:13:55.576]  I think that's how they're getting officers to go along with it, is through
[02:13:56.846 --> 02:14:08.723]  Training them that everyone wants to kill you and there's a there's a an immediate threat around every corner and you know there's you know that that sort of thing possibly Some people might refer to it as brainwashing
[02:14:10.472 --> 02:14:11.893]  Well, I've looked at the statistics.
[02:14:11.893 --> 02:14:34.961]  The number one thing that's killing cops is police being told to patrol roads that don't have a big enough shoulder, and I see police constantly hanging their butts out, and I try to go around them, and I mean, many more police, you can pull the numbers up, get killed being run over by cars than they do by people shooting them, and I watch police, and I notice here in Austin, they'll pull over
[02:14:36.391 --> 02:15:00.560]  You know, one time, two old ladies in a convertible car, and the cop had his hand on his gun and was acting scared, and I've had cops pull me over and they're acting scared, and I just don't understand why, and they've been taught to not, and I want you to speak to this, John, and correct me if I'm wrong in your area, to not be able to discriminate, and I don't mean by color, but by using common sense
[02:15:01.533 --> 02:15:03.875]  You know, of who looks like they're dangerous and who doesn't.
[02:15:03.875 --> 02:15:11.900]  They're just taught, and I've seen this in federal training manuals, about that priest may be a killer, that woman with a baby carriage, you know, it's who you least expect.
[02:15:11.900 --> 02:15:21.266]  When actual reality shows it's the opposite, and it actually gets more cops killed because they're just in a constant state of thinking everybody wants to kill them, they lose their discernment.
[02:15:21.266 --> 02:15:23.228]  Any views on that?
[02:15:23.228 --> 02:15:24.548]  Absolutely.
[02:15:24.548 --> 02:15:28.091]  You pinned the tail on the donkey with that one.
[02:15:28.091 --> 02:15:29.772]  That's exactly what's causing it.
[02:15:30.953 --> 02:15:38.386]  They're trying to train officers that there's a constant threat of being murdered.
[02:15:38.386 --> 02:15:39.248]  And it's not true.
[02:15:40.831 --> 02:15:42.972]  That's how they're going to get guys to go along with it.
[02:15:42.972 --> 02:15:47.415]  And the government loves them and the feds have got training and they care about them.
[02:15:47.415 --> 02:15:53.339]  But I mean, are the police upset about the MIAC report, federally written and issued to states?
[02:15:53.339 --> 02:15:57.622]  Missouri was the first one that got leaked, where they say returning vets, gun owners.
[02:15:57.622 --> 02:16:05.287]  I mean, now the White House has said publicly this whole thing is for basically people that have a John Wayne portrait in their house.
[02:16:05.287 --> 02:16:09.530]  Well, the problem is, is most officers haven't even read the Constitution.
[02:16:10.100 --> 02:16:14.262]  They don't know anything about the MIAC report.
[02:16:14.262 --> 02:16:15.984]  You see what I'm saying?
[02:16:15.984 --> 02:16:18.345]  Yes sir, I do.
[02:16:18.345 --> 02:16:28.311]  Break down any other points you've got for us or what you think about the police being trained for total shutdowns of cities.
[02:16:28.311 --> 02:16:32.233]  Well, I believe it's definitely going on.
[02:16:32.233 --> 02:16:38.617]  You can see officers from three and four man agencies
[02:16:39.324 --> 02:16:50.272]  At SWAT schools and these types of tactical type training schools, you'll see them from all over.
[02:16:50.987 --> 02:16:55.970]  You know, they're not just doing it in metropolitan areas, they're doing it in rural areas.
[02:16:55.970 --> 02:17:04.574]  And they're now having SWAT teams in the last decades run these swarms where on the highway they're in their gear searching people and it's all about intimidation.
[02:17:04.574 --> 02:17:06.115]  Police chiefs have said that.
[02:17:06.115 --> 02:17:07.816]  Just searching people en masse.
[02:17:07.816 --> 02:17:14.480]  I went down to the Comal River this weekend in New Braunfels and I don't know if I'll go back
[02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:22.842]  Because there were checkpoints everywhere, there were cops with cameras at high noon taking photos of people, and they looked crazed!
[02:17:22.842 --> 02:17:32.486]  It looked like when I've been in Venezuela, or Nicaragua, or Mexico, or on the border of Guatemala.
[02:17:32.486 --> 02:17:35.566]  I mean, you know what a third world looks like.
[02:17:35.566 --> 02:17:37.907]  They look crazed.
[02:17:37.907 --> 02:17:39.568]  Yes.
[02:17:39.568 --> 02:17:42.629]  Yes, that's exactly right.
[02:17:42.629 --> 02:17:43.449]  I don't understand it.
[02:17:44.351 --> 02:17:48.355]  I don't understand where they're getting these guys.
[02:17:48.355 --> 02:17:52.159]  I was fortunate before I became a police officer.
[02:17:52.159 --> 02:17:53.160]  I knew the truth.
[02:17:53.160 --> 02:17:55.863]  I knew about the things that were going on.
[02:17:55.863 --> 02:18:00.187]  I was a listener of your program.
[02:18:00.187 --> 02:18:01.609]  So I'm fortunate.
[02:18:01.609 --> 02:18:03.871]  Not everybody has been blessed with
[02:18:04.471 --> 02:18:07.233]  The gift of knowledge prior to becoming a police officer.
[02:18:07.233 --> 02:18:12.256]  What would happen to you, John, if you started trying to educate the other officers?
[02:18:12.256 --> 02:18:15.018]  Would they demote you or run you out?
[02:18:15.018 --> 02:18:19.841]  Oh, they would try, I suppose.
[02:18:19.841 --> 02:18:29.908]  But, you know, I think a lot of times when officers know what's going on, they're just kind of maybe ignored, you know?
[02:18:31.235 --> 02:18:41.395]  I've asked other officers if they would go along with gun confiscations and some have said yes and every once in a while you'll meet one that
[02:18:42.808 --> 02:18:45.009]  We'll say no, absolutely not.
[02:18:45.009 --> 02:18:45.649]  You know?
[02:18:45.649 --> 02:18:46.790]  But that's a no-brainer!
[02:18:46.790 --> 02:18:47.570]  That's illegal!
[02:18:47.570 --> 02:18:47.871]  Yes.
[02:18:47.871 --> 02:18:52.533]  I mean, what happened in Katrina was illegal, it came out it was illegal, but still they accelerate the training.
[02:18:52.533 --> 02:19:00.416]  I mean, you can see the massive paramilitary build-up and its entire architecture is pointed at the American people and they admit it's for us.
[02:19:00.416 --> 02:19:08.920]  I mean, this is high treason and now they admit 854,000 private spies and they're going to replace the police with private contractors.
[02:19:08.920 --> 02:19:11.502]  I mean, this is really happening and I just...
[02:19:12.282 --> 02:19:17.845]  I just wish we could reach out to these cops, but the average cop more and more is on a power trip.
[02:19:17.845 --> 02:19:19.326]  Yes, you're right.
[02:19:19.326 --> 02:19:19.886]  Absolutely.
[02:19:19.886 --> 02:19:23.468]  I see it every time I go to work.
[02:19:23.468 --> 02:19:26.129]  Every night.
[02:19:26.129 --> 02:19:28.190]  I'm sick of it.
[02:19:28.190 --> 02:19:30.111]  That's not what we're here for.
[02:19:30.111 --> 02:19:31.271]  We're supposed to help people.
[02:19:33.660 --> 02:19:39.482]  Well, they've replaced the guardian spirit that is of God with this thug predator spirit.
[02:19:39.482 --> 02:19:41.323]  And, uh, any other points?
[02:19:41.323 --> 02:19:42.384]  I appreciate your call.
[02:19:42.384 --> 02:19:42.824]  Anything else?
[02:19:42.824 --> 02:19:44.444]  That's it, Alex.
[02:19:44.444 --> 02:19:45.225]  Thank you.
[02:19:45.225 --> 02:19:46.085]  I appreciate your call.
[02:19:46.085 --> 02:19:46.725]  God bless you.
[02:19:46.725 --> 02:19:53.068]  Okay, we're going to talk to Robert and Chris and others, former military, once military, once former military, about this when we come back.
[02:19:53.068 --> 02:19:58.690]  This is the conversion of America from a free society to a thug society.
[02:19:58.690 --> 02:19:59.811]  And it's all about robbing you.
[02:20:01.496 --> 02:20:06.039]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:20:06.039 --> 02:20:06.959]  Number 1.
[02:20:06.959 --> 02:20:10.382]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:20:10.382 --> 02:20:11.242]  Number 2.
[02:20:11.242 --> 02:20:16.145]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:20:16.145 --> 02:20:16.886]  It's true.
[02:20:16.886 --> 02:20:21.749]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:20:21.749 --> 02:20:22.569]  Number 3.
[02:20:22.569 --> 02:20:26.172]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:20:26.172 --> 02:20:29.874]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:20:30.074 --> 02:20:30.855]  Number 4.
[02:20:30.855 --> 02:20:33.618]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:20:33.618 --> 02:20:37.302]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:20:37.302 --> 02:20:38.103]  Number 5.
[02:20:38.103 --> 02:20:42.248]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:20:42.248 --> 02:20:47.013]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:20:47.293 --> 02:20:51.458]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:20:51.458 --> 02:20:53.260]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:20:53.260 --> 02:20:55.523]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:20:55.523 --> 02:20:57.865]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:21:05.849 --> 02:21:07.109]  Tyranny is here.
[02:21:07.109 --> 02:21:11.052]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:21:11.052 --> 02:21:13.273]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:21:13.273 --> 02:21:19.136]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[02:21:19.136 --> 02:21:25.360]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:21:25.800 --> 02:21:31.782]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:21:31.782 --> 02:21:35.963]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[02:21:35.963 --> 02:21:40.244]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:21:40.244 --> 02:21:46.186]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:21:46.186 --> 02:21:49.747]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:21:49.747 --> 02:21:51.728]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:21:51.728 --> 02:21:52.148]  It's here.

[02:22:02.039 --> 02:22:05.420]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.

[02:22:30.410 --> 02:22:31.651]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:31.651 --> 02:22:36.214]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:36.214 --> 02:22:42.018]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:42.018 --> 02:22:45.660]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:45.660 --> 02:22:48.382]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:48.382 --> 02:22:53.445]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:22:53.445 --> 02:22:53.746]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:53.746 --> 02:22:55.087]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.770 --> 02:23:04.373]  It's the number one reason for slow and clogged bath drains.
[02:23:04.373 --> 02:23:06.034]  That's right, hair.
[02:23:06.034 --> 02:23:09.237]  And the number one way to open drains plugged with hair?
[02:23:09.237 --> 02:23:11.158]  The drain claw.
[02:23:11.158 --> 02:23:13.340]  Stop standing in dirty bath water.
[02:23:13.340 --> 02:23:15.241]  Stop using dangerous chemicals.
[02:23:15.241 --> 02:23:19.664]  Just push the drain claw past the pop-up in your sink or tub, twist, and pull.
[02:23:19.664 --> 02:23:23.347]  You'll be shocked at what this little tool can pull out of your drain.
[02:23:23.587 --> 02:23:30.889]  The Drain Claw has over 100 tiny hooks that claw through hair, toothpaste and shampoo that slows and clogs your drains.
[02:23:30.889 --> 02:23:34.710]  See how it works right now at TheDrainClaw.com.
[02:23:34.710 --> 02:23:42.272]  The Drain Claw is made in the USA and is the safest, easiest, most environmentally friendly solution to unclog bath drains.

[02:23:50.095 --> 02:23:51.296]  Buy the original.
[02:23:51.296 --> 02:23:52.757]  Buy the Drain Claw.

[02:24:05.123 --> 02:24:09.906]  Day after day, alone on the hill.
[02:24:12.878 --> 02:24:18.902]  We're continuing with some of your phone calls.
[02:24:18.902 --> 02:24:19.943]  Chuck Baldwin's coming up.
[02:24:19.943 --> 02:24:24.547]  I'm going to jam some other key news in as well.
[02:24:24.547 --> 02:24:30.731]  But right now, let's go to Robert in Texas.
[02:24:30.731 --> 02:24:32.392]  You're on the air.
[02:24:32.392 --> 02:24:32.853]  Go ahead.
[02:24:32.853 --> 02:24:33.573]  What's your view on
[02:24:35.185 --> 02:24:36.826]  The fact that America's going bad.
[02:24:36.826 --> 02:24:38.826]  I mean, this happens to most other countries.
[02:24:38.826 --> 02:24:41.347]  They get overtaken by corrupt individuals.
[02:24:41.347 --> 02:24:47.689]  The government is hyping up and getting the police and military ready for war with the people.
[02:24:47.689 --> 02:24:49.730]  What's your view on this?
[02:24:49.730 --> 02:25:00.693]  Well, just like anybody that, you know, I've watched this progression over the last 20 years or so, and I've seen it happening, you know, when I was in the military way back when I was a kid all the way
[02:25:01.505 --> 02:25:18.643]  So now I'm in my mid-40s, and it's amazing being in the law enforcement training area that I'm in, where you see the elevation of the drug war, and then the elevation of the laws on the other side of it, and you see the only person that loses here is the middle class.
[02:25:21.134 --> 02:25:48.304]  And you see the police officers being more and more militarized, and what I've seen lately in our work, and it's exactly kind of along the lines that you're talking about, is the introduction of the federal fusion part, where we bring in top recruits, or top candidates from around the state, and either state, local, or county police officers, train them for a three-week process,
[02:25:49.483 --> 02:25:53.796]  And the last week they have what's called kind of a disaster drill.
[02:25:54.401 --> 02:26:00.023]  And each one of these individuals have to learn how to maintain continuity in government.
[02:26:00.023 --> 02:26:07.966]  In other words, they're the response team, and then they work the federal government response team into their program.
[02:26:07.966 --> 02:26:10.226]  Yeah, they're becoming really federalized.
[02:26:10.226 --> 02:26:10.767]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:26:10.767 --> 02:26:15.628]  And it's admitted the CIA is actually secretly managing all these threat fusion centers.
[02:26:15.628 --> 02:26:23.311]  So there's a CIA officer over each one, and then they go, oh, we're sending the Austin, Travis County fusion center people to Iraq.
[02:26:24.191 --> 02:26:28.713]  And they're sending county judges to Fort Hood to learn about martial law.
[02:26:28.713 --> 02:26:29.593]  I mean, this is admitted.
[02:26:29.593 --> 02:26:31.074]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:26:31.074 --> 02:26:41.937]  You know, one of the things you have to... I wish Chuck Baldwin was on the phone right now, because I know he was 82nd Airborne, and I'm pretty sure he was, but I know he was in Fort Benning for a while.
[02:26:41.937 --> 02:26:45.479]  One of the top schools in America that really focuses on
[02:26:47.330 --> 02:26:50.892]  Things of that nature is School of America is now it's under a different name.
[02:26:50.892 --> 02:26:52.493]  They shut it down to rename it.
[02:26:52.493 --> 02:26:56.436]  And they had mentally trained the troops to learn how to torture and everything else.
[02:26:56.436 --> 02:26:59.138]  Oh, that's counterinsurgency the whole nine yards.
[02:26:59.138 --> 02:27:05.081]  And that is, we have that, I mean, you know, that was Pinochet all the way, all the way through in South America.
[02:27:05.081 --> 02:27:08.223]  You know, those, those whole, those, all those were branded through.
[02:27:08.223 --> 02:27:10.685]  And now the police are getting the pain compliance training.
[02:27:11.025 --> 02:27:11.926]  Absolutely.
[02:27:11.926 --> 02:27:14.647]  And you are dead on the nose with that.
[02:27:14.647 --> 02:27:16.288]  And it's coming in subtle.
[02:27:16.288 --> 02:27:17.609]  Subtle and more subtle.
[02:27:17.609 --> 02:27:26.734]  And then you have these guys coming back, reverting back to the mainland, you know, from these false foreign wars, which you and I totally agree on.
[02:27:26.734 --> 02:27:29.175]  And that's what Iraq is, is a giant laboratory.
[02:27:29.175 --> 02:27:38.841]  They send them there, they bring them back, they become police officers, they've run martial law in Afghanistan and Iraq, and now they're here, and now the government admits that's what it's for.
[02:27:38.841 --> 02:27:40.322]  I mean, is this not diabolical?
[02:27:41.082 --> 02:27:41.462]  It is.
[02:27:41.462 --> 02:27:51.925]  Now, what even happens even further, you see these, this big birthing of SWAT teams and special, you know, these ninjas running around in jumpsuits, you know, I mean, it's basically, but they're being fractionalized.
[02:27:51.925 --> 02:28:03.509]  It's just like, it's like if you were to set up a group of torturers, the first thing you do is you individualize them or you fractionalize them away from, you know, the mainstream police force.
[02:28:03.509 --> 02:28:09.791]  And they get into this group where they're focused on, and like you say, they're radicalized.
[02:28:10.673 --> 02:28:14.355]  And we, I've seen this more and more and more, especially here in Texas.
[02:28:14.355 --> 02:28:23.620]  Don't these cops realize they're part of a literal Soviet-style brainwashing campaign to be stormtroopers, to suppress the American people when the bankers totally bring us down?
[02:28:23.620 --> 02:28:24.780]  I mean, this is guaranteed.
[02:28:24.780 --> 02:28:26.861]  They're families, America, it's over.
[02:28:26.861 --> 02:28:29.102]  This is literally Nazi Germany, folks.
[02:28:29.102 --> 02:28:35.206]  This is creeping illegal death, and I mean, we're not joking around here!
[02:28:35.206 --> 02:28:40.008]  I think you got into it a minute ago with your bravery versus knowledge statement.
[02:28:40.723 --> 02:28:50.674]  And I think what you see is a lot of brave guys that are being brought back here after being completely desensitized over in these foreign wars.
[02:28:50.674 --> 02:28:58.402]  And they just don't have the knowledge because, I mean, you know, A, nobody learned anything about constitutional anything in the 80s.
[02:28:58.402 --> 02:29:00.084]  Here's the other problem.
[02:29:01.314 --> 02:29:04.595]  A lot of guys are smart or understand or have discernment.
[02:29:04.595 --> 02:29:06.056]  They don't use them.
[02:29:06.056 --> 02:29:18.721]  They can pick from this pool these cadres and then they expand the cadres to a full conversion to a paramilitary secret police intelligence web that's already dwarfing East Germany per capita.
[02:29:18.721 --> 02:29:20.822]  And I wish I could talk to you for hours.
[02:29:22.743 --> 02:29:26.145]  And I want to go to Chris and Clarence.
[02:29:26.145 --> 02:29:28.746]  You know, I'm going to do a couple hours this week.
[02:29:28.746 --> 02:29:30.867]  Will you try to listen?
[02:29:30.867 --> 02:29:38.330]  In fact, guys, tell me an hour that's open tomorrow so Robert and Chris and Clarence and others can be back on, so people can hear this directly from them.
[02:29:38.330 --> 02:29:40.111]  Can you call back tomorrow, Robert?
[02:29:40.111 --> 02:29:40.551]  Absolutely.
[02:29:40.551 --> 02:29:44.553]  Can you ask Chuck Baldwin about School of America and see what his comment is on that?
[02:29:44.553 --> 02:29:45.194]  Absolutely.
[02:29:45.194 --> 02:29:46.234]  Call me back tomorrow, though.
[02:29:46.234 --> 02:29:48.935]  I want to hear more about this Fusion Center situation.
[02:29:48.935 --> 02:29:49.716]  Folks, we're in trouble.
[02:29:51.738 --> 02:29:55.670]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.670 --> 02:29:58.337]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.448 --> 02:30:04.289]  Thousands of Americans are facing evacuation.
[02:30:04.289 --> 02:30:09.591]  If you or any of your loved ones might need to evacuate, you must do it yourselves.
[02:30:09.591 --> 02:30:12.392]  Please don't procrastinate until they do it for you.
[02:30:12.392 --> 02:30:16.054]  Remember the terrible conditions of those that didn't get out for Katrina.
[02:30:16.054 --> 02:30:22.317]  Go right now to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex or call 800-409-5633 for information on the new evacuation pack.
[02:30:26.258 --> 02:30:31.681]  It contains two weeks of delicious, easy-to-fix food, along with the equipment to prepare it.
[02:30:31.681 --> 02:30:34.762]  It's packed in a rugged, heavy-duty tote for transport.
[02:30:34.762 --> 02:30:39.164]  Evacuations are looming with the storms and the Gulf oil catastrophe.
[02:30:39.164 --> 02:30:44.507]  No matter where you live, wildfires, earthquakes, floods, and storms must be escaped.
[02:30:44.507 --> 02:30:48.349]  Don't be like a deer frozen in the headlights of oncoming disaster.
[02:30:48.349 --> 02:30:51.510]  At least prepare yourself with this two-week evacuation package.

[02:32:04.708 --> 02:32:05.969]  Tyranny is here.
[02:32:05.969 --> 02:32:09.833]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:32:09.833 --> 02:32:12.136]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:32:12.136 --> 02:32:18.022]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:32:18.022 --> 02:32:24.248]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:32:24.668 --> 02:32:30.650]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:32:30.650 --> 02:32:34.811]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:32:34.811 --> 02:32:39.112]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:32:39.112 --> 02:32:45.054]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:32:45.054 --> 02:32:48.615]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:32:48.615 --> 02:32:50.596]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:32:50.596 --> 02:32:51.016]  It's here.

[02:33:17.314 --> 02:33:18.976]  Declares War on the States.
[02:33:20.276 --> 02:33:25.672]  That is coming up, of course, presidential candidate, Constitution Party 2008, a pastor, a great patriot.
[02:33:26.698 --> 02:33:29.779]  We're going to be talking to him for the balance of the hour here in just a moment.
[02:33:29.779 --> 02:33:34.480]  First, I want to tell you about ID Stronghold, one of our great sponsors.
[02:33:34.480 --> 02:33:35.640]  You'll just love these folks.

[02:33:47.443 --> 02:33:50.684]  You know the government's dialing into cell phones and using the audio function to listen to you.
[02:33:50.684 --> 02:33:56.125]  You put it in these blockers, they can't dial in and track you, and then the cell phone can only track you when you want to use it.
[02:33:58.046 --> 02:34:03.529]  Do you know that RFID readers can pull personal and financial information from credit cards and ID cards in your pocket?
[02:34:03.529 --> 02:34:05.911]  And thieves have been caught thousands of times already doing it.
[02:34:05.911 --> 02:34:08.152]  Protect your privacy and your family.

[02:34:25.342 --> 02:34:26.203]  Calm.
[02:34:26.203 --> 02:34:30.286]  And lastly, you know they've been censoring the Obama deception online, trying to block it.
[02:34:30.286 --> 02:34:33.849]  You can get four copies of it for $19.95 until next Monday.
[02:34:33.849 --> 02:34:36.030]  Four copies, $5 a piece or a little less.
[02:34:36.030 --> 02:34:38.152]  Give them to everybody you know.
[02:34:38.152 --> 02:34:42.375]  It exposes the globalist takeover, the banking collapse, the police state program.
[02:34:42.375 --> 02:34:44.417]  Available at Infowars.com.
[02:34:44.417 --> 02:34:46.078]  And I want to thank everybody for their support.

[02:34:51.829 --> 02:35:01.460]  Now I got Chuck on because he's been demonized by the Southern Poverty Law Center and others and they tell horrible lies about him and try to demonize him.
[02:35:02.708 --> 02:35:03.989]  Because he's a leader.
[02:35:03.989 --> 02:35:05.569]  And he's having an effect out there.
[02:35:05.569 --> 02:35:07.990]  And he was demonized in the MIAC report, along with Ron Paul.
[02:35:07.990 --> 02:35:09.931]  And they said, this is the enemy of the government.
[02:35:09.931 --> 02:35:12.312]  This is who the police are being trained to take on.
[02:35:12.312 --> 02:35:18.095]  And now we know from the Washington Post, confirming what we'd already covered, that there's 854,000 private spies.
[02:35:18.095 --> 02:35:21.156]  The Threat Fusion Centers are merging the military and police.
[02:35:21.156 --> 02:35:22.777]  The CIA is over that.
[02:35:22.777 --> 02:35:27.779]  They're basically having School of America-type secret police training for the police.
[02:35:28.879 --> 02:35:30.220]  And it's so frightening.
[02:35:30.220 --> 02:35:33.642]  It's being done by the offshore banks who want global government on record.
[02:35:33.642 --> 02:35:35.904]  Global government's now been announced.
[02:35:35.904 --> 02:35:36.865]  It's happening.
[02:35:36.865 --> 02:35:39.126]  And we've got to reach out to our military and police now.
[02:35:39.126 --> 02:35:43.409]  We, of course, played a clip of Stuart Rhodes talking about that in the last hour with Oath Keepers.
[02:35:43.829 --> 02:35:45.991]  But I wanted to get into his new article, D.C.
[02:35:45.991 --> 02:35:47.773]  declares war on the states.
[02:35:47.773 --> 02:36:03.048]  We'll also jam in Chris in Arizona and Clarence in Oklahoma, who are former military, want to comment on that we've confirmed, the Austin SWAT team and others, this is in the Fort Hood Sentinel, are training to lock down cities, are training for gun confiscation in Iraq.
[02:36:03.709 --> 02:36:06.070]  So this is so incredible what's happening.
[02:36:06.070 --> 02:36:08.690]  They're trying to turn the military and police against us.
[02:36:08.690 --> 02:36:12.711]  We've got to reach out to them now and educate them like our lives depend on it.
[02:36:12.711 --> 02:36:14.671]  Chuck Baldwin, great to have you on with us, sir.
[02:36:14.671 --> 02:36:15.291]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:36:15.291 --> 02:36:16.752]  Good to be with you again.
[02:36:16.752 --> 02:36:19.812]  Let's break down your concern with what's happening in our world.
[02:36:19.812 --> 02:36:21.793]  The globalists are now out of the closet.
[02:36:21.793 --> 02:36:24.253]  You've written an excellent piece.
[02:36:24.253 --> 02:36:27.094]  DC declares war on the states.
[02:36:27.094 --> 02:36:27.234]  Yes.
[02:36:28.724 --> 02:36:33.726]  And of course, that's exactly what this lawsuit against Arizona is.
[02:36:33.726 --> 02:36:42.349]  It is a declaration of war against the sovereignty and the independence of that state and by implication against every state in the country.
[02:36:42.349 --> 02:36:55.914]  Without a doubt, the Obama administration and the administration before him, quite frankly, had no desire to honor the laws of our country and to do something substantive against illegal immigration.
[02:36:56.594 --> 02:37:10.318]  They in fact, under George W. Bush, the floodgates were opened and over half, I would guess, of all of the illegal immigrants that are in this country today came across the border since George W. Bush became president.
[02:37:11.170 --> 02:37:17.836]  And now that Arizona has stepped up to the plate and said, OK, federal government, you're not going to do it, we're going to defend ourselves.
[02:37:17.836 --> 02:37:21.580]  We are going to stop this invasion against our state, against our citizens.
[02:37:21.580 --> 02:37:25.223]  Our people are being killed, properties being destroyed.
[02:37:25.223 --> 02:37:29.427]  We cannot afford the crime and everything else that goes along with this invasion.
[02:37:30.120 --> 02:37:35.524]  And they did what any sensible people would do, that is, they decided to defend themselves.
[02:37:35.524 --> 02:37:37.026]  And what does the federal government do?
[02:37:37.026 --> 02:37:40.288]  It decides to file a lawsuit against the state.
[02:37:40.288 --> 02:37:47.894]  Now, as far as I'm concerned, that is a declaration of war against the state of Arizona.
[02:37:47.894 --> 02:37:53.479]  Well, I agree with you, and I had Sheriff Babu on and made some state and national headlines last week.
[02:37:54.690 --> 02:37:54.810]  That's
[02:38:14.656 --> 02:38:16.878]  Just incredible crime waves.
[02:38:16.878 --> 02:38:19.640]  Mexico is a failed state, has collapsed.
[02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:21.361]  The State Department even admits that.
[02:38:21.361 --> 02:38:32.090]  And then Arizona says if we pull somebody over for speeding or drunk driving, this is what the bill says, and they are an illegal alien, upon first contact, we're going to take them to jail.
[02:38:32.090 --> 02:38:36.073]  And the feds say, not only are we going to sue you, we're going to support the sanctuary cities.
[02:38:37.335 --> 02:38:40.056]  This is the SPP globalization.
[02:38:40.056 --> 02:38:44.679]  Is it not, with Bush signing it and Obama continuing it, high treason?
[02:38:44.679 --> 02:38:50.041]  The definition of high treason is siding with a foreign power against your sovereignty and your interests.
[02:38:50.041 --> 02:38:58.005]  Is it not high treason to be leaving our borders wide open and then trying to block a state when they're begging for aid and literally under attack?
[02:38:59.744 --> 02:39:02.186]  I have no problem with your definition, Alex.
[02:39:02.186 --> 02:39:05.167]  I think that what has been going on in Washington, D.C.
[02:39:05.167 --> 02:39:08.549]  for quite a while is nothing short of treasonous.
[02:39:08.549 --> 02:39:14.332]  Would you consider in Los Angeles 95% of all outstanding warrants for homicide, 95%?
[02:39:16.643 --> 02:39:22.504]  In 2004, the last year we have stats for this, we're targeting illegal aliens.
[02:39:22.504 --> 02:39:27.625]  Up to two-thirds of all fugitive felony warrants were for illegal aliens.
[02:39:27.625 --> 02:39:36.847]  Some reports say that 83% of warrants for murder in Phoenix, 86% of warrants for murder in Albuquerque, New Mexico are for illegal aliens.
[02:39:36.847 --> 02:39:43.368]  Remember that illegal aliens kill something like 12 American citizens every single day.
[02:39:44.689 --> 02:39:54.020]  And they've killed more American citizens than have been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan combined, and they kill that many each year.
[02:39:54.020 --> 02:39:59.147]  And then they kill another 13 by drunk driving on the streets of America.
[02:40:00.268 --> 02:40:01.689]  Every single day.
[02:40:01.689 --> 02:40:08.393]  And you think about the death and carnage, not to mention the crimes that you alluded to a moment ago.
[02:40:08.393 --> 02:40:09.854]  And this is a war.
[02:40:09.854 --> 02:40:14.016]  This is war against the people of the United States of America.
[02:40:14.016 --> 02:40:16.697]  And the border states are feeling the brunt of it.
[02:40:16.697 --> 02:40:22.501]  And I thank God for Jan Brewer and the people there in Arizona and all the American people need to support these folks.
[02:40:23.413 --> 02:40:27.256]  Now, meanwhile, the feds are doing everything they can to leave illegal aliens alone.
[02:40:27.256 --> 02:40:29.237]  It's on record in sanctuary cities.
[02:40:29.237 --> 02:40:33.440]  They let them go for drunk driving, assault.
[02:40:33.440 --> 02:40:34.942]  It's incredible.
[02:40:34.942 --> 02:40:45.329]  In major cities like Oakland, the police are announcing they're not going to respond to burglaries, grand theft auto, cutting power lines, and 37 other crimes.
[02:40:45.329 --> 02:40:51.314]  But there's unlimited federal money to federalize police and train them in intelligence meetings that we have video of.
[02:40:52.677 --> 02:41:06.850]  That the Founding Fathers are bad, I have that in my film Road to Tyranny, that gun owners are bad, that returning veterans and constitutionalists and Chuck Baldwin and Ron Paul are bad, and the Gadsden flag is bad, and the American flag on a car is bad.
[02:41:06.850 --> 02:41:08.452]  I mean, this is absurd!
[02:41:08.452 --> 02:41:10.394]  This is like Monty Python or something!
[02:41:11.772 --> 02:41:12.793]  Well, yeah.
[02:41:12.793 --> 02:41:16.436]  Unfortunately, this is the world we live in today.
[02:41:16.436 --> 02:41:22.222]  I just produced a column today, Alex, you should be getting it shortly, called Top Secret America.
[02:41:22.222 --> 02:41:29.869]  The rest of the story I take off on that Washington Post report that came out last week talking about the secret government.
[02:41:29.869 --> 02:41:35.634]  Of course, they do more of a cover-up than anything else on Washington Post, you can imagine.
[02:41:36.935 --> 02:41:54.576]  By virtue of what they do bring to light, I think just gives verification to things that you and I have been talking about for a number of years, and that is that there are elements within our federal government that have designs against the freedoms and the liberties of the people that do not want to
[02:41:56.258 --> 02:42:00.101]  Uphold their office to the Constitution.
[02:42:00.101 --> 02:42:11.790]  They are using the military establishment to train for the purposes of potentially corralling and subduing the American citizenry.
[02:42:11.790 --> 02:42:19.356]  I get some quotes in my column today from Joel Skousen's World Affairs Brief, who's done some excellent research.
[02:42:19.816 --> 02:42:20.217]  I think so.
[02:42:36.658 --> 02:42:40.440]  To turn on the American people whenever they feel it's necessary.
[02:42:40.440 --> 02:42:48.664]  The NSA is involved in all kinds of dark and sinister activities, and I go into some of that in my column today.
[02:42:48.664 --> 02:42:51.466]  Just the stuff that you've been talking about for a long time.
[02:42:51.466 --> 02:42:54.167]  But now then, as you said, it's out in the open.
[02:42:54.167 --> 02:42:55.968]  They used to try to hide it.
[02:42:55.968 --> 02:43:00.210]  They're not hiding it anymore, and I think more and more of the American people are beginning to wake up, quite frankly.
[02:43:00.816 --> 02:43:05.459]  Well, again, Chuck Baldwin, presidential candidate, 2008, Constitution Party, joins us.
[02:43:05.459 --> 02:43:07.521]  We'll give you his website in a moment to read his great columns.
[02:43:07.521 --> 02:43:10.723]  We also carry them at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:43:10.723 --> 02:43:15.846]  But everything in that Washington Post report, as you said, is a whitewash.
[02:43:15.846 --> 02:43:21.350]  InfraGard is there, they don't mention that, with license to kill orders, with tens of thousands.
[02:43:21.350 --> 02:43:23.492]  At the time, four years ago, when it leaked, it was 50,000 plus.
[02:43:25.373 --> 02:43:29.336]  The clergy response teams, we got that three years before it was mainstream news.
[02:43:29.336 --> 02:43:42.284]  Now they admit tens of thousands of preachers are giving FEMA teaching materials saying, render unto Caesar Romans 13, go to the FEMA camp, turn your guns in, take the inoculation.
[02:43:42.284 --> 02:43:45.086]  This is a giant strategic secret program
[02:43:45.666 --> 02:43:58.009]  With millions of spies, federalizing police, using Iraq as a laboratory to create ruthless killers, to then come back and tell them, Chuck Baldwin, Ron Paul, they're the enemy.
[02:43:58.009 --> 02:44:04.610]  You have the New York Times with the Explorer Scouts and other reports saying they're trying to take on disgruntled vets.
[02:44:04.610 --> 02:44:06.230]  People laugh, well those are 14-year-old kids.
[02:44:06.230 --> 02:44:07.631]  Well that came out two years ago.
[02:44:07.631 --> 02:44:08.591]  In two years they're going to be 18.
[02:44:09.631 --> 02:44:11.172]  You know, they're 16 now.
[02:44:11.172 --> 02:44:12.512]  It's happening nationwide.
[02:44:12.512 --> 02:44:14.993]  The LAPD's taking over the Boy Scouts.
[02:44:14.993 --> 02:44:18.075]  They're openly training them to wage war against the American people.
[02:44:18.075 --> 02:44:20.116]  This is how Germany fell.
[02:44:20.116 --> 02:44:21.496]  This is how China fell.
[02:44:21.496 --> 02:44:22.937]  This is what Russia did.
[02:44:22.937 --> 02:44:31.701]  This is textbook, 100%, red alert, and it's going on right behind the curtain, and now the curtain's coming back, and we see it.
[02:44:32.461 --> 02:44:34.743]  And I know I'm ranting, sir.
[02:44:34.743 --> 02:44:36.224]  I'm just so worried.
[02:44:36.224 --> 02:44:37.585]  This is so real.
[02:44:37.585 --> 02:44:39.606]  Nobody thought we'd have government-run health care.
[02:44:39.606 --> 02:44:42.168]  Nobody thought they'd start all these new wars.
[02:44:42.168 --> 02:44:46.871]  No one could believe all the surveillance and the banks stealing trillions.
[02:44:46.871 --> 02:44:47.732]  But it's all happening.
[02:44:48.615 --> 02:44:50.256]  Sure.
[02:44:50.256 --> 02:45:05.086]  And as I say in my column today, you know, basically all of the safeguards that were put in place by the Founding Fathers to protect our freedoms constitutionally have dissipated one by one to the point that now, as I see it, Alex,
[02:45:05.806 --> 02:45:08.867]  We only have two defenses left.
[02:45:08.867 --> 02:45:12.769]  And I think, number one, we have state autonomy.
[02:45:12.769 --> 02:45:14.850]  State sovereignty.
[02:45:14.850 --> 02:45:22.493]  And I think what Jan Brewer and her fellow Arizonans are doing is just the first shot across the bow.
[02:45:22.493 --> 02:45:23.453]  It won't be the last.
[02:45:23.453 --> 02:45:26.855]  And it's got the globalists scared and other states are lining up saying... Oh, yeah.
[02:45:27.615 --> 02:45:32.479]  I mean, you look at Montana and Tennessee that passed the Firearms Freedom Act in their state.
[02:45:32.479 --> 02:45:40.146]  You got a legislator in the state of Georgia who's passing similar legislation except it deals with all products, not just firearms.
[02:45:40.146 --> 02:45:46.992]  I mean, I would guess to say there are probably over 20 states right now that are in various stages
[02:45:47.552 --> 02:45:48.753]  Because they had been through a tyranny.
[02:46:15.922 --> 02:46:16.642]  Absolutely.
[02:46:16.642 --> 02:46:17.523]  They had lived it.
[02:46:17.523 --> 02:46:18.623]  They had experienced it.
[02:46:18.623 --> 02:46:27.667]  They knew that the American people were not properly armed and prepared to defend themselves, that they would not maintain freedom very long.
[02:46:27.667 --> 02:46:37.552]  As I see it, Alex, those are the two major defenses that we have left at this point in time in our history.
[02:46:37.552 --> 02:46:42.294]  And I think we need to start focusing on our state governments, our governor's races.
[02:46:42.294 --> 02:46:44.114]  Instead of getting 60% turnout for a
[02:46:45.635 --> 02:46:48.938]  For a presidential election, how about 60% locally?
[02:46:48.938 --> 02:46:50.959]  And this is do or die.
[02:46:50.959 --> 02:46:54.462]  And I want to talk more about solutions with you and then try to jam in a few calls with Chuck Baldwin today.
[02:46:54.462 --> 02:46:58.665]  But Chuck, how do you see the globalists countering all of this?
[02:46:58.665 --> 02:47:01.087]  Because the pendulum is clearly swinging back.
[02:47:01.087 --> 02:47:03.208]  There's a huge political realignment.
[02:47:03.208 --> 02:47:04.529]  The system even admits.
[02:47:04.529 --> 02:47:13.116]  Did you read the Financial Times of London where Robert Shapiro told Obama, you need an Oklahoma City or a 9-11 so that you can look like a powerful leader?
[02:47:13.116 --> 02:47:14.257]  I'm really concerned
[02:47:14.677 --> 02:47:18.759]  I am too, and Don McIlvenny.
[02:47:18.759 --> 02:47:21.981]  I was with him in Denver just this past weekend.
[02:47:21.981 --> 02:47:28.724]  We had a great conference out there with some real terrific patriots, and he talked about that very thing as well.
[02:47:28.724 --> 02:47:31.586]  He's concerned that there could be some kind of a false flag.
[02:47:32.126 --> 02:47:34.748]  Terrorist attack of some sort between now and the elections.
[02:47:34.748 --> 02:47:54.601]  Yeah, I think what they're going to try to do is what they've done, and that is to try to, you know, demonize people like us, like the MIAC report and these other things, and they're going to go to their stooges there in Montgomery at the SLP and, you know, try to categorize us as nuts and so forth.
[02:47:54.601 --> 02:47:58.764]  But the fact of the matter is, I do believe that the pendulum is swinging toward
[02:47:59.364 --> 02:48:04.125]  State sovereignty, state independence, especially in some states.
[02:48:04.125 --> 02:48:05.226]  Not all the states, of course.
[02:48:05.226 --> 02:48:07.386]  Some of the states are too far gone.
[02:48:07.386 --> 02:48:16.889]  But the states along the Southwest and Oklahoma and even in Texas where you are, though, I know you've got a big battle there with the big cities, the big city governments that you're fighting.
[02:48:16.889 --> 02:48:19.970]  But you go to Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, the Dakotas.
[02:48:20.811 --> 02:48:34.045]  You go down to Utah, I mean there's even Tennessee, South Carolina, New Hampshire, Vermont, there's a lot of states around the country that are really, really beginning to see increased activity among their people for the freedom fight.
[02:48:34.045 --> 02:48:35.827]  And I really think it's going to continue.
[02:48:35.827 --> 02:48:38.610]  And I'm not pessimistic at all, Alex.
[02:48:38.610 --> 02:48:41.213]  I do believe that we can win this thing.
[02:48:42.193 --> 02:48:46.677]  Well, I agree with you, and for those that just tuned in, we're not joking about this.
[02:48:46.677 --> 02:48:48.358]  This is so hardcore.
[02:48:48.358 --> 02:48:55.925]  When you've studied the facts and what the feds even admit they're doing, and they've already stolen so much money and done so many illegal things, they're not backing off.
[02:48:55.925 --> 02:48:56.725]  People need to understand.
[02:48:57.446 --> 02:49:01.189]  Just like other countries have fallen to tyranny, it's happening here.
[02:49:01.189 --> 02:49:06.893]  And everybody needs to hit their knees and pray to God to also, you know, give them discernment.
[02:49:06.893 --> 02:49:09.955]  And people need to realize, all of you are leaders in this fight.
[02:49:09.955 --> 02:49:20.803]  Whatever you can do now to spread the word that what's happening in Washington is illegal, and the solution is at the states, and that the globalists are going to pull out every dirty trick they can.
[02:49:20.803 --> 02:49:25.527]  I had a caller earlier that trains law enforcement in Texas, and he said what you had just said.
[02:49:25.527 --> 02:49:26.368]  In fact, it's incredible.
[02:49:27.148 --> 02:49:44.573]  He said that they're training at the fusion centers and getting the hardcore killers from Iraq and selecting, you know, kind of the lunatics that have been mentally, you know, broken down by three, four, five tours, and that they are forging them as pretty much a school of America's takeover operation.
[02:49:44.573 --> 02:49:47.954]  Secret police torture everything here in the United States.
[02:49:47.954 --> 02:49:50.695]  And he wanted me to ask you about that and school of America's.
[02:49:52.386 --> 02:49:58.474]  Well, I've heard these things, and I certainly do not discount them.
[02:49:58.474 --> 02:50:04.382]  In fact, Joel Skousen, in his most recent newsletter, he mentioned that as well.
[02:50:04.382 --> 02:50:06.845]  And Joel, as you know, is as well-researched
[02:50:08.044 --> 02:50:12.087]  As any man in America, I think that that is going on.
[02:50:12.087 --> 02:50:22.717]  But again, I want to focus on what you just said, and that is, the answer is a resurrection, a revival, a resurgence of state independence and sovereignty.
[02:50:22.717 --> 02:50:24.659]  The founders were so wise.
[02:50:24.659 --> 02:50:31.466]  Whenever the Constitution was created in 1787, the states did not surrender their sovereignty.
[02:50:32.086 --> 02:50:34.968]  They still maintain their independence.
[02:50:34.968 --> 02:50:47.694]  And I think that at the end of the day, Alex, it is going to be the state governments, the governors and the leaders and the people of those states, they're going to stand up and they're going to put this New World Order in their place.
[02:50:47.694 --> 02:50:50.956]  And I tell you, I do think that they're worried about that.
[02:50:50.956 --> 02:50:53.457]  And that means that we are on the right track.
[02:50:53.457 --> 02:50:54.137]  God bless you.
[02:50:54.137 --> 02:50:54.597]  Stay there.
[02:50:54.597 --> 02:50:55.698]  Chuck Baldwin's our guest.
[02:50:55.698 --> 02:50:57.339]  We'll give you his website when we come back.
[02:51:01.860 --> 02:51:04.862]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[02:51:04.862 --> 02:51:06.923]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[02:51:06.923 --> 02:51:09.685]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[02:51:09.685 --> 02:51:11.906]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[02:51:11.906 --> 02:51:13.307]  Okay, here it comes.
[02:51:13.307 --> 02:51:15.208]  But first, the facts.
[02:51:15.208 --> 02:51:17.149]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[02:51:17.149 --> 02:51:19.130]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[02:51:19.130 --> 02:51:22.812]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[02:51:22.812 --> 02:51:30.577]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[02:51:30.577 --> 02:51:31.177]  Sinofresh.
[02:51:31.437 --> 02:51:34.499]  Now, here's your limited time discount offer to use Sinofresh.

[02:51:49.589 --> 02:51:49.649]  888-906-3636.
[02:51:49.649 --> 02:51:50.810]  Call right now for $2 off per bottle.
[02:51:50.810 --> 02:51:51.190]  Mention GCN.
[02:51:51.190 --> 02:51:52.111]  Buy Sinofresh.com.
[02:51:52.111 --> 02:51:52.411]  It works!
[02:52:01.519 --> 02:52:06.482]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:52:06.482 --> 02:52:07.463]  What have we got?
[02:52:07.463 --> 02:52:09.904]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:52:09.904 --> 02:52:10.925]  A republic.
[02:52:10.925 --> 02:52:13.566]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:52:13.566 --> 02:52:15.828]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:52:15.828 --> 02:52:17.869]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:52:17.869 --> 02:52:19.550]  So they think they own our land?
[02:52:19.550 --> 02:52:20.871]  They think they own our water?
[02:52:20.871 --> 02:52:21.471]  Children?
[02:52:21.471 --> 02:52:22.592]  Our education?
[02:52:22.592 --> 02:52:23.413]  Our money?
[02:52:23.413 --> 02:52:27.075]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:52:27.435 --> 02:52:31.140]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:52:31.140 --> 02:52:32.402]  You're being warned.
[02:52:32.402 --> 02:52:33.443]  We have the facts.
[02:52:33.443 --> 02:52:34.585]  We have the Constitution.
[02:52:34.585 --> 02:52:35.506]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:52:35.506 --> 02:52:36.387]  We have common law.
[02:52:36.387 --> 02:52:38.911]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:38.911 --> 02:52:41.875]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you... Don't tread on me.
[02:52:41.875 --> 02:52:42.696]  Rise of the Republic.
[02:52:42.796 --> 02:52:47.762]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:52:47.762 --> 02:52:49.264]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:52:49.264 --> 02:52:50.345]  Don't tread on me.
[02:52:50.345 --> 02:52:57.193]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:53:01.570 --> 02:53:04.954]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[02:53:04.954 --> 02:53:08.859]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[02:53:08.859 --> 02:53:12.564]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[02:53:12.564 --> 02:53:20.594]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants from municipal water.
[02:53:20.674 --> 02:53:20.994]  I think so.
[02:53:50.674 --> 02:53:50.975]  I think so.
[02:54:09.867 --> 02:54:13.128]  You know, we've got Chris, Clarence, Bill, a bunch of former military people.
[02:54:13.128 --> 02:54:19.130]  I'm gonna have an hour of the show open tomorrow, and I want to hear from you about what we've been talking about, but we're so limited on time.
[02:54:19.130 --> 02:54:20.511]  I'm not gonna be able to go to those calls.
[02:54:20.511 --> 02:54:21.531]  We just got five minutes left.
[02:54:21.531 --> 02:54:24.372]  I apologize, and please call us back tomorrow.
[02:54:25.012 --> 02:54:26.133]  We're almost out of time here.
[02:54:26.133 --> 02:54:28.915]  Chuck Baldwin, you've got the floor in the last five minutes.
[02:54:28.915 --> 02:54:31.416]  ChuckBaldwinLive.com.
[02:54:31.416 --> 02:54:34.178]  You've got your Top Secret America, the rest of the story article out.
[02:54:34.178 --> 02:54:35.279]  That's excellent.
[02:54:35.279 --> 02:54:37.540]  I'm glad you reminded me about Joel Skousen.
[02:54:37.540 --> 02:54:40.442]  Of course, Cleon Skousen, his uncle, wrote The Naked Communist.
[02:54:40.442 --> 02:54:41.443]  Or was it The Naked Capitalist?
[02:54:41.443 --> 02:54:41.823]  I forget.
[02:54:41.823 --> 02:54:43.745]  Exposing the whole banker takeover.
[02:54:43.745 --> 02:54:44.945]  And he's a great guy.
[02:54:44.945 --> 02:54:49.108]  I'm gonna get him on about his intel about using the troops in Iraq domestically.
[02:54:49.108 --> 02:54:50.949]  But that's now all admitted.
[02:54:50.949 --> 02:54:54.572]  But in closing, Obama is dropping like a rock.
[02:54:55.673 --> 02:54:57.934]  The globalists are cornered rats.
[02:54:57.934 --> 02:55:05.639]  They're not invincible, but so many Christian churches have been taught that it's the end of the world, so we should just lay down and go along with Romans 13.
[02:55:05.639 --> 02:55:07.640]  As a pastor, what's your view on that?
[02:55:07.640 --> 02:55:10.562]  Man, you just hit my hot button, Alex.
[02:55:10.562 --> 02:55:19.008]  I tell you what, we would not be in the shape we're in today if the pastors in America had not just laid down on the job.
[02:55:19.008 --> 02:55:21.649]  Some of it's the 501c3 tax exempt status.
[02:55:21.649 --> 02:55:23.731]  Some of it is just plain old-fashioned laziness.
[02:55:24.566 --> 02:55:40.073]  Some of it is ignorance, but whatever the reason, you know, they have used that Romans 13 mantra for so long to sedate the churches of this country and to cause them to be lethargic, and they're using it against us.
[02:55:40.073 --> 02:55:52.518]  And I'm sure that for some of them it's not intentional, but boy, that result has been, for the most part, the Church of the Lord Jesus has been totally ineffective in standing against
[02:55:53.098 --> 02:56:17.258]  The forces of evil in this country and I don't see a lot of turnaround on the horizon in that regard either and that's why I think that God is raising up the people like Alex Jones and the Ron Paul revolution and the Campaign for Liberty and a lot of these other groups that are out there that are standing against the New World Order and they're standing for the things that are right.
[02:56:17.258 --> 02:56:21.222]  If the churches and the preachers had been doing it all along we wouldn't be in this shape.
[02:56:21.702 --> 02:56:23.602]  But they're not doing it, for the most part.
[02:56:23.602 --> 02:56:27.223]  And that's why I've got a lot of people that watch me online, Alex, quite frankly.
[02:56:27.223 --> 02:56:36.465]  We livestream our Sunday morning services every Sunday, and we've got people that watch us because they can't find a church in their hometown that they can go to and get the truth.
[02:56:36.465 --> 02:56:38.946]  So, you know, whatever the reason, you're right.
[02:56:38.946 --> 02:56:41.966]  The pastors have just not been doing the job.
[02:56:41.966 --> 02:56:44.227]  You know, if the colonial preachers in America
[02:56:45.148 --> 02:56:47.410]  They led the rebellion against King George III!
[02:57:02.006 --> 02:57:02.847]  Absolutely.
[02:57:02.847 --> 02:57:17.180]  Without that, what they call the Black Regiment, that group of patriot clergymen leading the way and preaching the sermons and giving them the inspiration and the information that they needed to wage that fight for independence.
[02:57:17.180 --> 02:57:22.726]  If they had not done that, there is no question that the Revolutionary War would have never taken place.
[02:57:24.864 --> 02:57:29.247]  In fact, some of the first people killed at the start of the war were prominent pastors.
[02:57:29.247 --> 02:57:39.674]  Well, let's remember that the shot heard around the world, there at Concord and Lexington, those shots were fired by Christian men
[02:57:43.056 --> 02:57:45.057]  Of one congregation.
[02:57:45.057 --> 02:57:47.018]  The church at Lexington.
[02:57:47.018 --> 02:57:49.640]  The pastor's name was Jonas Clark.
[02:57:49.640 --> 02:57:51.141]  They were the militiamen.
[02:57:51.141 --> 02:57:57.204]  They were the ones that came to the defense at Concord and Lexington.
[02:57:57.204 --> 02:57:59.825]  First at Lexington and then at Concord Bridge, of course.
[02:57:59.825 --> 02:58:04.108]  And others came to their assistance as the battle grew.
[02:58:04.108 --> 02:58:06.489]  But the first men, the first ones,
[02:58:07.090 --> 02:58:19.889]  That stood up there at Lexington Green against the Crown's forces that had come to arrest John Hancock and Sam Adams and take the guns was that pastor and his congregation.
[02:58:21.667 --> 02:58:25.049]  Beautifully put, ChuckBallmanLive.com.
[02:58:25.049 --> 02:58:30.053]  We look forward to talking to you again, sir, and we appreciate you joining us and all the great work you do.
[02:58:30.053 --> 02:58:32.795]  That column's up there, Top Secret America, the rest of the story.
[02:58:32.795 --> 02:58:35.056]  We'll get that posted over at InfoWars.com.
[02:58:35.056 --> 02:58:36.417]  We'll talk to you soon, Pastor.
[02:58:36.417 --> 02:58:37.818]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:58:37.818 --> 02:58:38.819]  Godspeed.
[02:58:38.819 --> 02:58:39.799]  Great job, crews.
[02:58:39.799 --> 02:58:40.160]  Stay with us.
