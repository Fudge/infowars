[00:00:03.191 --> 00:00:07.377]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:08.038 --> 00:00:08.839]  You want answers?
[00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.522]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:10.542 --> 00:00:14.848]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.415]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:20.828 --> 00:00:21.949]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.293]  I am Jason Vermas, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.414 --> 00:00:29.879]  We are live this April 8th, 2010.
[00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:33.403]  And out of the gates, it is tax season.
[00:00:34.464 --> 00:00:40.051]  And the globalists are openly telling you, you will be paying more taxes than ever in the coming years.
[00:00:40.271 --> 00:00:40.852]  On top,
[00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:44.070]  Of the health care bill they just signed.
[00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.711]  On top of the GIVE Act they passed.
[00:00:47.051 --> 00:00:54.935]  On top of all the socialism that has been going on and progressing in this country, Bernanke is now saying that the U.S.
[00:00:55.215 --> 00:00:58.196]  must face difficult tax choices.
[00:00:58.357 --> 00:01:01.118]  They want even more!
[00:01:01.578 --> 00:01:05.480]  And there's another article out there from the Associated Press that dovetails with this.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.441]  Nearly half of all U.S.
[00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:09.962]  households escape federal income tax.
[00:01:10.462 --> 00:01:12.804]  See, they're turning neighbor against neighbor.
[00:01:13.284 --> 00:01:15.606]  They're saying, look, your neighbors aren't paying taxes.
[00:01:15.907 --> 00:01:16.627]  They're the reason.
[00:01:16.747 --> 00:01:25.394]  No, it's the corporations that pay literally zero tax and absorb multi-billions in corporate welfare.
[00:01:25.434 --> 00:01:26.535]  This one's out of the AP.
[00:01:27.856 --> 00:01:38.005]  Facing unsustainable budget deficits, the United States will have to make difficult choices between higher taxes and social spending, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said.
[00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:46.532]  This is the same guy that said that we were out of the recession, then doubled back, made up a term and said we were in a double-dip recession.
[00:01:46.772 --> 00:01:49.154]  We can't say depression anymore in this country.
[00:01:50.035 --> 00:01:55.099]  We can't own up to the over 20% unemployment in this country.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.821]  That's the reality, folks.
[00:01:57.461 --> 00:02:04.487]  Wading into a fiercely contested political debate, Bernanke said trimming the deficit was made more urgent by the rapidly aging U.S.
[00:02:04.547 --> 00:02:05.288]  population.
[00:02:06.317 --> 00:02:13.204]  Inevitably, addressing the fiscal challenges posed by an aging population will require a willingness to make difficult choices.
[00:02:13.244 --> 00:02:15.867]  And this is why they want a lower standard of living.
[00:02:16.047 --> 00:02:18.329]  This is why they want socialized medicine.
[00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:20.551]  This is why they want death panels.
[00:02:21.112 --> 00:02:25.656]  This is why we saw the cover of Newsweek not only saying we are now socialists,
[00:02:26.297 --> 00:02:32.819]  But also the case for killing Granny, and how it's a good thing, and how we'll just have to have end-of-life care.
[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.021]  We don't really need them to live another 2, 5, 10, 15, or 20 years.
[00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:41.563]  If you've lived 55 or 60 years, that should be enough.
[00:02:41.603 --> 00:02:43.764]  You should die gracefully for the state.
[00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:49.686]  This out-of-control, collectivist mindset is being thrust
[00:02:51.218 --> 00:02:51.478]  I think?
[00:03:06.647 --> 00:03:11.010]  Modifications to entitlement programs such as Social Security and MediCorp.
[00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.514]  We've been telling you for years they were going to take your Social Security and I promise you they will.
[00:03:16.534 --> 00:03:20.317]  They're openly, the banks are openly saying they're going to take your pensions.
[00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:26.081]  Isn't it great you worked 30 or 40 years so you could live your twilight years out in comfort?
[00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:27.362]  Well guess what?
[00:03:27.662 --> 00:03:30.545]  They don't want you to live your twilight years out at all.
[00:03:30.905 --> 00:03:31.846]  Forget about comfort.
[00:03:32.066 --> 00:03:38.332]  They'll be stealing everything from you so you have a hard road ahead in your 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s.
[00:03:38.652 --> 00:03:39.653]  What a loving government.
[00:03:39.913 --> 00:03:40.574]  Let me read that again.
[00:03:40.614 --> 00:03:42.656]  This is from Bernanke's mouth.
[00:03:42.896 --> 00:03:50.123]  To avoid large and unsustainable budget deficits, the nation will ultimately have to choose among higher taxes,
[00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:51.424]  Which they'll do.
[00:03:51.945 --> 00:03:55.969]  Modifications to entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare.
[00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:58.172]  Now, modifications means you don't get it.
[00:03:58.692 --> 00:04:00.134]  That's what the modification is.
[00:04:00.694 --> 00:04:01.896]  They're not just going to take a little away.
[00:04:02.036 --> 00:04:03.277]  They'll take a little away at first.
[00:04:03.538 --> 00:04:04.359]  It'll be incremental.
[00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:06.061]  But you'll wind up with nothing.
[00:04:06.321 --> 00:04:07.122]  In squalor.
[00:04:07.482 --> 00:04:11.427]  That's what always happens when you let an out-of-control government
[00:04:11.707 --> 00:04:17.509]  Grow and grow and grow and grow until again the state becomes God.
[00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.950]  You no longer have inherent human rights.
[00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:24.111]  You are there to serve the state, like in communist China.
[00:04:24.932 --> 00:04:28.633]  And we all know about the push towards that type of society, even in this country.
[00:04:28.873 --> 00:04:35.956]  Again, during the 60th anniversary of the Mao regime, we lit the Empire State Building up.
[00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:40.052]  In those communist Chinese Maoist colors.
[00:04:40.112 --> 00:04:43.478]  It's all featured in my new film, Invisible Empire, A New World Order to Find.
[00:04:43.758 --> 00:04:44.539]  We'll be back after this.
[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.142]  I'm Jason Bermeson for Alex Jones.
[00:04:46.443 --> 00:04:49.007]  We're live over at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:04:58.263 --> 00:04:59.524]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:04:59.564 --> 00:05:04.908]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:05:05.148 --> 00:05:09.771]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:05:10.171 --> 00:05:15.255]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:05:15.755 --> 00:05:20.439]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:27.883]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:05:28.083 --> 00:05:28.983]  And here's the best part.
[00:05:29.183 --> 00:05:35.567]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:05:35.887 --> 00:05:38.728]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:05:39.068 --> 00:05:40.969]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.210]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.410]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:05:50.094 --> 00:05:54.604]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:05:54.925 --> 00:05:57.310]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:06:00.484 --> 00:06:02.725]  You're subject to other police action.
[00:06:02.865 --> 00:06:03.785]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:04.125 --> 00:06:07.846]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:08.066 --> 00:06:10.267]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:10.287 --> 00:06:15.729]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:22.411]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:22.831 --> 00:06:28.373]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:28.773 --> 00:06:32.494]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:06:32.994 --> 00:06:36.975]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:37.255 --> 00:06:42.817]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:43.217 --> 00:06:46.198]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:46.758 --> 00:06:48.178]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:48.738 --> 00:06:49.258]  It's here.
[00:06:49.859 --> 00:06:51.219]  Secure your copy today.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.674]  At InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:58.157 --> 00:06:58.697]  You worry.
[00:06:59.077 --> 00:07:00.798]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:07:01.098 --> 00:07:03.338]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:07:03.638 --> 00:07:05.479]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[00:07:05.739 --> 00:07:06.939]  Your answer may be at hand.
[00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:10.540]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.802]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:07:16.182 --> 00:07:19.503]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:07:19.983 --> 00:07:21.343]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:07:21.663 --> 00:07:24.284]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[00:07:24.524 --> 00:07:27.465]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[00:07:27.825 --> 00:07:36.007]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[00:07:36.267 --> 00:07:40.648]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[00:07:40.948 --> 00:07:44.649]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.
[00:07:44.969 --> 00:07:50.250]  Or if you're not online, call her 24-hour, toll-free order line at 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.550]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:56.091]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[00:08:00.009 --> 00:08:02.210]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:05.631]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:12.174 --> 00:08:13.014]  We are back!
[00:08:13.134 --> 00:08:15.855]  I am Jason Burma, sitting in live for Alex Jones.
[00:08:15.875 --> 00:08:19.076]  And I want to remind everybody, we have two new films coming out.
[00:08:19.136 --> 00:08:21.537]  Invisible Empire and New World Order Define.
[00:08:21.917 --> 00:08:28.480]  My film, two hours and twelve minutes plus extras, really not only takes the term New World Order and defines it,
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:35.622]  As a global, tyrannical government in which every part of your life is micromanaged by a ruling elite.
[00:08:35.662 --> 00:08:37.163]  But we also have Police State 4.
[00:08:37.443 --> 00:08:38.123]  I'm also in that.
[00:08:38.803 --> 00:08:41.524]  I spent some time out at the G20 in Pittsburgh.
[00:08:41.584 --> 00:08:44.505]  This is the film by Alex Jones, Rob Dew, and Jason Douglas.
[00:08:44.525 --> 00:08:46.966]  And we have a brand new trailer coming out.
[00:08:47.686 --> 00:08:50.227]  At the 30 aftermarker, so stay tuned for that.
[00:08:50.247 --> 00:08:51.087]  This is a great film.
[00:08:51.107 --> 00:08:53.728]  This really breaks down COG, continuity of government.
[00:08:54.048 --> 00:08:56.029]  That's what the shadow government is.
[00:08:56.089 --> 00:08:58.130]  This is how these people move.
[00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:07.513]  They create these organizations that are above the Constitution, above the Bill of Rights, that don't have checks and balances, and over time they infiltrate and control them.
[00:09:07.853 --> 00:09:09.854]  This is why we have sole source contracts.
[00:09:09.894 --> 00:09:14.796]  This is why we have soldiers in the Middle East laughing about killing civilians.
[00:09:15.376 --> 00:09:18.299]  We really have to get back to the way we used to be.
[00:09:18.559 --> 00:09:20.521]  A constitutional republic.
[00:09:20.761 --> 00:09:23.003]  A society that was not morally degraded.
[00:09:23.343 --> 00:09:25.105]  One that had the high ground.
[00:09:25.826 --> 00:09:31.531]  Not an imperial nation that is literally hell-bent on bringing in a new world order.
[00:09:31.551 --> 00:09:34.974]  So look for that Police State 4 trailer coming up at the 30 break.
[00:09:36.195 --> 00:09:37.815]  Also want to thank some of our great sponsors.
[00:09:38.155 --> 00:09:40.356]  They make this program possible.
[00:09:40.376 --> 00:09:44.397]  Without them, we wouldn't be able to bring you PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com for free.
[00:09:44.437 --> 00:09:47.957]  We wouldn't be able to post all of our films for free on YouTube.
[00:09:48.038 --> 00:09:49.958]  SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:09:49.978 --> 00:09:55.539]  That's 877-327-0365 or go to SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:09:55.559 --> 00:09:59.320]  They literally have the best non-hybrid, storable,
[00:10:02.721 --> 00:10:14.949]  Alright, I want to get right back to what Bernanke is now out in the open telling you.
[00:10:15.009 --> 00:10:23.896]  He is telling you they are about to raise taxes, they are about to take away Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and much more.
[00:10:24.696 --> 00:10:26.117]  They say it's going to be modified.
[00:10:26.297 --> 00:10:28.099]  Let me just read the quote for everybody.
[00:10:29.096 --> 00:10:32.497]  To avoid large and unsustainable budget deficits.
[00:10:32.517 --> 00:10:41.740]  Well of course we have large and unsustainable budget deficits when the Federal Reserve literally prints the money out of nowhere for the private bankers.
[00:10:42.561 --> 00:10:44.741]  Literally prints the money out of nowhere.
[00:10:44.761 --> 00:10:46.262]  We're not backed by anything.
[00:10:46.302 --> 00:10:52.184]  Of course we're going to have unsustainable debt when we spent multi-trillions in illegal wars overseas.
[00:10:53.024 --> 00:10:54.144]  But that's our fault.
[00:10:54.204 --> 00:10:55.305]  The people are bad.
[00:10:55.725 --> 00:10:59.826]  So the nation will ultimately have to choose among higher taxes.
[00:11:00.006 --> 00:11:01.126]  And it won't be a choice.
[00:11:01.626 --> 00:11:03.266]  You're going to get the higher taxes.
[00:11:03.667 --> 00:11:06.247]  Modifications to entitlement programs.
[00:11:06.567 --> 00:11:07.707]  See, you're supposed to be entitled.
[00:11:07.868 --> 00:11:09.148]  It's not an entitlement program.
[00:11:09.328 --> 00:11:11.908]  You pay your entire life into Social Security.
[00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:13.949]  They just take it out of your paycheck.
[00:11:14.369 --> 00:11:16.430]  Entitlement programs, please.
[00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.310]  Such as Social Security and Medicare.
[00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.971]  Less spending on everything else from education to defense.
[00:11:22.631 --> 00:11:29.158]  So now we're literally telling you we're going to dumb down your children, and the defense budget's never going away, folks.
[00:11:29.238 --> 00:11:30.780]  That's a laughable joke.
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.304]  The black ops defense budget is off the charts.
[00:11:34.584 --> 00:11:39.329]  These are the people that are dealing the drugs into this country, and we're going to get to that later.
[00:11:39.349 --> 00:11:40.650]  We have Peter Dale Scott coming up.
[00:11:41.431 --> 00:11:48.656]  In the second hour to really go over the heroin drug smuggling that's been going on in Afghanistan for years.
[00:11:49.097 --> 00:11:49.337]  Years.
[00:11:49.377 --> 00:12:02.226]  That network has been set up over there in those poppy fields for years and when they kind of got out of our control prior to 9-11, 9-11 was the excuse to take it over and now Karzai's brother is the lead opium dealer.
[00:12:02.246 --> 00:12:02.927]  Let me repeat that.
[00:12:03.107 --> 00:12:03.968]  Hamid Karzai
[00:12:04.728 --> 00:12:21.419]  Our puppet dictator that we put into Afghanistan, that was an ex-Chevron executive, that said thumbs up to the big Inokle oil pipeline that was said no to by the Taliban prior to 9-11, his brother is the lead opium dealer there.
[00:12:21.519 --> 00:12:22.060]  Wow!
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.841]  That's incredible, right?
[00:12:23.881 --> 00:12:27.984]  What's even more incredible, that's superseding both administrations.
[00:12:28.797 --> 00:12:35.939]  Through the Bush administration and now the Barack Obama administration, for the past eight years he's been a CIA asset on the payroll.
[00:12:36.419 --> 00:12:38.260]  And that's not Jason Burma's telling you this.
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.641]  This is the New York Times in October.
[00:12:41.921 --> 00:12:49.003]  Brother of Afghan leaders said to be paid by CIA, the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:12:49.503 --> 00:12:56.045]  One of the arms of this continuity of government, illegal shadow government takeover.
[00:12:57.026 --> 00:12:58.346]  That's how the country is run.
[00:12:59.718 --> 00:13:01.559]  But our leaders tell us that we're bad.
[00:13:01.839 --> 00:13:03.040]  We need to be taxed more.
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.821]  Our programs need to leave.
[00:13:07.142 --> 00:13:08.623]  Tackling the massive U.S.
[00:13:08.683 --> 00:13:20.929]  budget deficits and ballooning debt has become a hot-button political issue in Washington as President Barack Obama and his predecessor, George W. Bush, have spent billions of taxpayer money to stave off economic collapse.
[00:13:21.369 --> 00:13:24.471]  A total lie to stave off economic collapse.
[00:13:24.671 --> 00:13:33.236]  No, we gave 27 trillion plus dollars to the bankers so that they could consolidate power, so that they could move out people from their homes.
[00:13:33.296 --> 00:13:34.997]  They created the housing bubble!
[00:13:35.357 --> 00:13:38.358]  And the banks could take over massive parts of infrastructure.
[00:13:38.759 --> 00:13:39.659]  That's what happened.
[00:13:39.959 --> 00:13:41.440]  That's what those bailouts were.
[00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:46.643]  They literally put a gun to the congressional heads that actually wanted to stop it.
[00:13:48.183 --> 00:13:49.904]  People like Brad Sherman said, you know what?
[00:13:50.404 --> 00:13:55.367]  If we don't pass this thing, we'll have martial law in the streets of America.
[00:13:56.227 --> 00:13:58.128]  Martial law in the streets of America.
[00:13:58.148 --> 00:14:02.850]  And don't think they won't pull that card again when they want another bailout.
[00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:07.933]  When they say they have to raise taxes from 30 and 40 percent to 50 and 60 percent.
[00:14:08.453 --> 00:14:09.854]  Because again, the model
[00:14:10.876 --> 00:14:14.039]  is squeezing out the middle class, the upper middle class.
[00:14:14.079 --> 00:14:16.020]  The elite don't want any competition.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:22.565]  They want to be up here and they want to create a serf slave class down here and that's what we are to them.
[00:14:23.026 --> 00:14:24.147]  We are no different!
[00:14:25.011 --> 00:14:29.214]  From those routers journalists that were gunned down in Iraq by soldiers.
[00:14:29.254 --> 00:14:31.656]  We're literally cannon fodder in their eyes.
[00:14:32.336 --> 00:14:36.139]  In their policy papers we are referred to as sheeple and chattel.
[00:14:36.199 --> 00:14:37.700]  It is time to wake up folks.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.862]  It's time to step up to the plate say I'm not paying higher taxes.
[00:14:42.143 --> 00:14:44.104]  These are not entitlement programs.
[00:14:44.324 --> 00:14:47.967]  These are programs I paid into my entire life.
[00:14:48.827 --> 00:14:49.928]  My entire life.
[00:14:52.270 --> 00:15:00.016]  Bernanke said quick steps to balance the books would hurt the fragile recovery, but that a credible long-term plan could spark economic growth today.
[00:15:00.416 --> 00:15:01.837]  Oh, they can always spark growth today.
[00:15:01.877 --> 00:15:04.680]  People like Larry Summers told you again the recession was over.
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:06.401]  And what do they say?
[00:15:06.441 --> 00:15:07.962]  It's around 10% unemployment.
[00:15:08.022 --> 00:15:12.465]  Meanwhile, we're at 22% real unemployment in this country.
[00:15:12.686 --> 00:15:19.251]  And for people my age, in their late 20s, their early 30s, even their early 40s, it's much higher.
[00:15:19.311 --> 00:15:20.472]  It's much more difficult.
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.860]  To get an entry-level position.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.761]  They want you flipping burgers.
[00:15:24.801 --> 00:15:28.121]  They want you to be meaningless bank tellers.
[00:15:28.141 --> 00:15:29.461]  They don't want you to have a career.
[00:15:29.942 --> 00:15:31.942]  They don't want you to create commerce and business.
[00:15:32.182 --> 00:15:34.082]  They don't want you to compete.
[00:15:36.543 --> 00:15:40.203]  And the way they're turning people against one another, they're saying, this is America's fault.
[00:15:40.243 --> 00:15:41.684]  These are the citizens' fault.
[00:15:41.764 --> 00:15:43.924]  If we don't hire taxes, we're doomed.
[00:15:44.184 --> 00:15:45.144]  The people are bad.
[00:15:45.304 --> 00:15:47.065]  After all, nearly half of U.S.
[00:15:47.105 --> 00:15:49.105]  households escape federal income tax.
[00:15:50.202 --> 00:15:51.486]  That's an actual headline.
[00:15:51.747 --> 00:15:54.996]  Tax Day is a dreaded deadline for millions, but for nearly half of U.S.
[00:15:55.036 --> 00:15:57.603]  households, it's simply somebody else's problem.
[00:15:58.848 --> 00:16:02.209]  Do you see the psychological warfare that is being waged on you?
[00:16:02.909 --> 00:16:04.349]  So that you're mad at your neighbor?
[00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:08.110]  About 47% will pay no federal income taxes at all for 2009.
[00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:10.771]  That's a cooked number.
[00:16:11.011 --> 00:16:16.673]  The real people not paying the taxes, let's repeat it folks, are the large corporations.
[00:16:17.273 --> 00:16:25.495]  They're the ones that not only don't pay taxes, they get huge tax credits and corporate welfare under government programs.
[00:16:26.335 --> 00:16:27.455]  That's the big secret.
[00:16:27.675 --> 00:16:28.556]  That's the joke.
[00:16:29.036 --> 00:16:34.917]  See, they'll squeeze out the guy that does make two or three million dollars and has a successful small business.
[00:16:35.178 --> 00:16:36.558]  They don't want him to succeed.
[00:16:36.738 --> 00:16:44.900]  They don't want him making twenty to thirty million in the next five years, because that could turn into two hundred to three hundred million in the next ten.
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:46.121]  And then what happens?
[00:16:46.381 --> 00:16:48.141]  Oh, then the elite have to work with them.
[00:16:49.202 --> 00:16:50.422]  Or they have to take them over.
[00:16:51.656 --> 00:17:00.803]  Or they have to find a way for them never to get in that position in the first place, and that's again, putting them in that tax bracket where they take 60-70% of their income.
[00:17:01.644 --> 00:17:05.687]  And then they blame the other middle class for not paying taxes.
[00:17:06.088 --> 00:17:09.971]  About 47% will pay no federal income taxes at all for 2009.
[00:17:10.191 --> 00:17:15.895]  Either their incomes were too low, or they qualified for enough credits, deductions, and exemptions to eliminate their liability.
[00:17:16.596 --> 00:17:21.439]  That's according to projections by the Tax Policy Center, a Washington research organization.
[00:17:21.459 --> 00:17:22.460]  Of course, it's a D.C.
[00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:26.242]  research organization that is putting out this type of propaganda.
[00:17:26.262 --> 00:17:34.628]  If you really want to understand how the economy works, how the Federal Reserve System works, you can easily pick up America, Freedom to Fascism from Infowars.com.
[00:17:35.008 --> 00:17:41.172]  And we have our interview with Aaron Russo, Reflections and Warnings, free in many cases, when you buy other films.
[00:17:41.212 --> 00:17:45.395]  I think if you get Invisible Empire, you can get Reflections and Warnings for another $5, folks.
[00:17:48.086 --> 00:17:55.894]  And again, why are we paying taxes to a criminal government that deals the drugs, the heroin and the cocaine?
[00:17:56.983 --> 00:18:04.786]  That is an illegal horse in Afghanistan and Iraq, and they're beating the drums against Iran, and we'll get to that momentarily.
[00:18:05.246 --> 00:18:20.010]  Because Russia and the United States did sign this new agreement, this new nuclear arms pact, and the other headline that follows that, that's right after that, is Iran will not beg to avoid sanctions.
[00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:21.231]  And that's from Ahmadinejad.
[00:18:22.955 --> 00:18:25.996]  Obama and Medvedev sign arms treaty, press Iran.
[00:18:26.016 --> 00:18:35.220]  The United States and Russia signed a landmark strategic nuclear disarmament treaty on Thursday and said new sanctions may be necessary to put pressure on Iran to renounce its nuclear ambitions.
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:48.626]  President Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev signed the pact at a ceremony in the medieval Prague Castle after talks that covered nuclear security, Iran's atomic program, and an uprising in the Central Asian state of Kyrgyzstan.
[00:18:49.605 --> 00:18:50.085]  We're good to go.
[00:19:10.965 --> 00:19:13.106]  Under our establishment control.
[00:19:13.706 --> 00:19:15.787]  Under the Anglo-American Empire.
[00:19:16.567 --> 00:19:26.031]  Iran's president said on Thursday he would not plead with opponents of Tehran's nuclear program in order to avoid sanctions as Russia and the United States said new measures might be necessary.
[00:19:26.051 --> 00:19:29.352]  And that's very dangerous because there has been somewhat of a rift.
[00:19:29.952 --> 00:19:31.614]  Between Russia and the United States.
[00:19:31.654 --> 00:19:41.505]  Not the phony Cold War rift, but right now those two big powers are vying for the number one and number two spot in this new world order.
[00:19:41.685 --> 00:19:42.526]  We'll be back after this.
[00:19:42.566 --> 00:19:43.447]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:43.567 --> 00:19:44.508]  I am Jason Bermas.
[00:19:44.688 --> 00:19:47.291]  We're live at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:19:59.994 --> 00:20:03.155]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[00:20:03.355 --> 00:20:11.399]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[00:20:11.559 --> 00:20:16.681]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster on the market today.
[00:20:16.861 --> 00:20:19.762]  We offer a two-week free trial and a lifetime warranty.

[00:20:28.346 --> 00:20:29.427]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:29.587 --> 00:20:33.990]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:39.874]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:20:39.974 --> 00:20:43.396]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:20:43.616 --> 00:20:46.498]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.261]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:20:51.401 --> 00:20:51.622]  Call 800-686-2237.

[00:20:58.827 --> 00:21:01.130]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:03.393]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:21:03.413 --> 00:21:06.296]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:21:06.737 --> 00:21:11.483]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:21:11.843 --> 00:21:16.049]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:21:16.329 --> 00:21:18.691]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:21:18.791 --> 00:21:21.233]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:21:21.573 --> 00:21:24.156]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:21:24.496 --> 00:21:32.082]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:21:32.422 --> 00:21:37.683]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:21:37.803 --> 00:21:40.084]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:21:40.124 --> 00:21:44.105]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:21:44.345 --> 00:21:45.265]  And I got news for you.
[00:21:45.425 --> 00:21:46.706]  You're everyone else.
[00:21:46.766 --> 00:21:47.766]  Invisible Empire.

[00:24:39.775 --> 00:24:42.056]  But I want to go back to the economy for just a moment.
[00:24:42.076 --> 00:24:45.397]  We'll start taking your calls at the 30 after.
[00:24:46.597 --> 00:24:50.618]  Fed boss Greenspan says no one saw the crisis coming.
[00:24:51.198 --> 00:24:54.759]  And of course, Alan Greenspan helped orchestrate this crisis.
[00:24:54.799 --> 00:24:57.700]  He is featured in my next film, Invisible Empire.
[00:24:58.220 --> 00:24:59.480]  April 15th, folks.
[00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:00.721]  Pre-order it today.
[00:25:01.721 --> 00:25:14.636]  Only in America could the man responsible for interest rates and banking regulation at the time, Alan Greenspan, incredulously insist, as he is again in testimony at the Financial Crisis Commission, that they had very little to do with it.
[00:25:14.956 --> 00:25:16.418]  A sick joke.
[00:25:16.558 --> 00:25:22.605]  And only in America could you imagine the story of a one-eyed neurology intern with undiagnosed Asperger's syndrome
[00:25:22.805 --> 00:25:27.810]  Who ended up making a fortune by applying the principles of value investing to subprime mortgage lending.
[00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:29.811]  Greenspan says no one saw it coming.
[00:25:30.011 --> 00:25:30.852]  Well, this man did.
[00:25:31.092 --> 00:25:33.294]  He's not the only one that saw this coming.
[00:25:33.855 --> 00:25:35.596]  That person made money off of it.
[00:25:35.877 --> 00:25:41.141]  But if you were listening to Alex Jones in 2003, he was telling you, buy gold and silver.
[00:25:41.161 --> 00:25:46.926]  Remember when gold was under $300 an ounce and now it sits around $1,000, sometimes more.
[00:25:46.946 --> 00:25:48.628]  It almost made its way up to $1,200 at one point.
[00:25:49.949 --> 00:25:57.030]  Tell me another investment that literally went up over 300% in less than 10 years.
[00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:58.090]  There isn't one.
[00:25:59.111 --> 00:26:01.871]  And this is because the dollar has been devalued.
[00:26:02.111 --> 00:26:04.772]  It is no longer the world reserve currency.
[00:26:04.792 --> 00:26:10.493]  And they've now announced that to you over the last 18 months with these G20 and G8 summits.
[00:26:10.993 --> 00:26:16.894]  Medvedev, the person we just signed this treaty with, actually had a model global currency coin.
[00:26:17.614 --> 00:26:19.354]  He's like, this is what we want one day.
[00:26:19.634 --> 00:26:21.215]  We want a global currency.
[00:26:21.895 --> 00:26:36.338]  And then the IMF, the International Monetary Fund, absorbed our SEC, absorbed the Federal Reserve Banking System that is in place, and now they're printing, well they're not printing them, they're just administering them.
[00:26:36.398 --> 00:26:38.659]  It's a digital currency, it's not physical yet.
[00:26:39.379 --> 00:26:41.399]  More than ever, it is the new reserve currency.
[00:26:41.459 --> 00:26:44.620]  It's called a Special Drawing Rights Unit.
[00:26:45.638 --> 00:26:47.819]  Under globalist control.
[00:26:48.539 --> 00:26:50.959]  As they gut the dollar, yes, everything is going down.
[00:26:51.159 --> 00:27:00.341]  As they gut the economy, as they de-industrialize us, as we no longer have factory work here, as long as we don't produce anything, don't worry, everything's going to be okay.
[00:27:00.381 --> 00:27:01.422]  That's what they're telling you.
[00:27:01.802 --> 00:27:03.422]  And no one saw it coming.
[00:27:03.962 --> 00:27:06.383]  As they de-industrialize the United States and dump the dollar,
[00:27:06.883 --> 00:27:08.464]  No, a lot of us saw this coming.
[00:27:08.864 --> 00:27:12.266]  A lot of us warned our friends and our family that tough times were ahead.
[00:27:12.426 --> 00:27:13.346]  And they're still ahead.
[00:27:13.526 --> 00:27:14.287]  They're not done.
[00:27:14.787 --> 00:27:19.849]  They're openly announcing, openly announcing they are about to raise taxes again.
[00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:23.771]  And all that money you paid into Social Security, gone.
[00:27:24.332 --> 00:27:27.073]  All that money you paid into Medicare, gone.
[00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:32.535]  Those are entitlement programs, which you are no longer entitled to.
[00:27:32.555 --> 00:27:36.320]  And the banks last week came out openly and said, you know what?
[00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:38.622]  We're taking your pensions, too.
[00:27:39.696 --> 00:27:51.239]  Earlier in the year, I was on a trip with Aaron Dykes, shooting out in Philadelphia, and one of my good friends, one of my fraternity brothers lives down there, and it just so happened he was getting together with a couple other of my fraternity brothers.
[00:27:51.259 --> 00:28:00.422]  So, we all got together for some beers, and we were talking about the economy, and a lot of these guys are school teachers, or some of them are actually out of work.
[00:28:00.442 --> 00:28:06.564]  One of them works for the IRS, and one of them had the nerve to tell me that that's what capitalism does.
[00:28:07.364 --> 00:28:09.304]  It's okay they're taking the pension funds.
[00:28:10.024 --> 00:28:15.905]  And I looked at him, and I said, so if you worked as a teacher somewhere for 25 years and they didn't give you your pension, you wouldn't be upset?
[00:28:16.226 --> 00:28:17.406]  Hey, that's the way things are!
[00:28:17.706 --> 00:28:23.367]  How brainwashed are you as you're slurping down that beer, watching the Phillies-Yankees game?
[00:28:24.087 --> 00:28:29.148]  That you pay into a system for 20 or 30 years, then you get nothing!
[00:28:29.828 --> 00:28:31.368]  That's worse than slavery!
[00:28:31.608 --> 00:28:32.768]  Don't you feel duped?
[00:28:32.988 --> 00:28:35.589]  Don't you feel dirty that you just went along with it?
[00:28:36.249 --> 00:28:37.253]  That you submitted?
[00:28:38.075 --> 00:28:39.280]  I'm not going to submit to this!
[00:28:39.581 --> 00:28:42.370]  I am going to fight this tooth and nail!
[00:28:43.493 --> 00:28:56.716]  And when banksters like Bernanke get out there and just openly say, we're taking more taxes and you're not getting your Social Security and you're not getting your Medicare, it's time to stop just shouting from the rooftops, folks.
[00:28:56.936 --> 00:28:58.536]  It's time to start knocking on doors.
[00:28:58.776 --> 00:29:02.017]  It's time to start putting pressure on Congress and the Senate.
[00:29:02.037 --> 00:29:04.437]  It's time to get down into D.C.
[00:29:04.777 --> 00:29:06.058]  and say, we are fed up.
[00:29:06.138 --> 00:29:07.038]  We're done with this.
[00:29:07.438 --> 00:29:18.521]  We can't let Fox News and Republican operatives, which are really just establishment operatives, there is no real left and right, it's all controlled by the same people, take over movements like the Tea Party.
[00:29:18.541 --> 00:29:25.023]  We have to have a huge show and we can't let green anarchists make us look bad in the next week.
[00:29:25.723 --> 00:29:34.665]  We gotta take charge, we gotta get the information out to the people, so please go to InfoWars.com right now, get the all-important videos, make copies, and hand them out to your friends and family.
[00:29:34.845 --> 00:29:37.385]  The new Police State 4 trailer coming up after the break.
[00:29:48.847 --> 00:29:51.748]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.748 --> 00:29:55.530]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:58.371 --> 00:30:03.575]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[00:30:03.675 --> 00:30:06.396]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:30:06.436 --> 00:30:10.879]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:16.222]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.

[00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:33.970]  This film needs to be seen.

[00:30:46.188 --> 00:30:46.929]  Shadow Government.

[00:31:03.365 --> 00:31:04.285]  Tyranny is here.
[00:31:04.625 --> 00:31:08.387]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:31:08.567 --> 00:31:10.867]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:31:10.967 --> 00:31:16.249]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:31:16.669 --> 00:31:22.931]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:31:23.331 --> 00:31:28.833]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:31:29.273 --> 00:31:33.014]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:31:33.494 --> 00:31:37.476]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:31:37.776 --> 00:31:43.418]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:31:43.718 --> 00:31:46.839]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:31:47.259 --> 00:31:48.679]  The Police State isn't coming.
[00:31:49.239 --> 00:31:49.740]  It's here.

[00:31:58.277 --> 00:32:06.682]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[00:32:06.983 --> 00:32:12.086]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the U.S.
[00:32:12.126 --> 00:32:12.666]  and Canada.
[00:32:12.986 --> 00:32:19.571]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[00:32:20.091 --> 00:32:23.333]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[00:32:23.473 --> 00:32:25.714]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[00:33:19.733 --> 00:33:20.694]  We are back.
[00:33:20.714 --> 00:33:21.554]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:21.595 --> 00:33:27.899]  I am Jason Burmess sitting in and just momentarily we are going to get to the Police State 4 trailer.
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:34.444]  Brand new out of the gates from Police State 4 premiering a week after my film Invisible Empire, A New World Order to Find.
[00:33:35.225 --> 00:33:35.605]  I don't know.
[00:33:56.323 --> 00:33:58.204]  I think it was like 11 or 12 o'clock.
[00:33:58.264 --> 00:34:02.807]  By 1 o'clock you really started to see them gating the entire place up.
[00:34:03.107 --> 00:34:11.333]  By the next day they had brought in the National Guard and many other military units from across the country as well as police units.
[00:34:11.373 --> 00:34:14.155]  I couldn't believe what I was actually seeing.
[00:34:14.855 --> 00:34:19.680]  So we called up the local military facility and said, hey, can we talk about this?
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:21.542]  We'd like to get a comment.
[00:34:21.562 --> 00:34:22.983]  They said, yeah, come on down.
[00:34:23.444 --> 00:34:26.126]  So we came up to the gates and right away I knew we weren't going to get in.
[00:34:26.146 --> 00:34:31.292]  It was a huge gated facility, armed guards, and we asked to talk to their media spokesman.
[00:34:31.852 --> 00:34:33.153]  Sure, we'll have somebody out for you.
[00:34:33.213 --> 00:34:34.753]  Just hang out over there on the side.
[00:34:35.393 --> 00:34:38.334]  So, 5 minutes goes by, 10 minutes goes by, 20 minutes goes by.
[00:34:38.394 --> 00:34:40.435]  Finally, 25 minutes, somebody comes out.
[00:34:41.015 --> 00:34:44.297]  And I'm filming because I don't know how much footage I'm actually going to get.
[00:34:45.037 --> 00:34:47.438]  And right away, the guy's giving us problems off the bat.
[00:34:47.458 --> 00:34:53.220]  And we're like, look man, we're just here to find out what's going on tomorrow at the G20.
[00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:58.942]  How many units you're having out there, what your role is supposed to be, what the orders are, who put this out there.
[00:34:59.742 --> 00:35:01.884]  And he's like, no, I'm not going to talk to you.
[00:35:02.064 --> 00:35:04.586]  If you come back tomorrow, maybe I'll talk to you.
[00:35:04.606 --> 00:35:06.707]  We're like, all right, whatever.
[00:35:06.947 --> 00:35:08.909]  So finally, we turn around and leave.
[00:35:08.949 --> 00:35:12.371]  We get followed out all the way up to the next exit.
[00:35:12.411 --> 00:35:13.432]  We were clearly followed.
[00:35:13.472 --> 00:35:14.573]  It wasn't even close.
[00:35:15.629 --> 00:35:45.009]  We get back to the hotel and we're lying around the hotel and I'm with Jason Douglas and Rob do the two co-directors on this film with Alex Jones and all of a sudden Douglas who put the car the rental car in his name gets a call and we probably would have gone back to the rental car agency because this person was like hey we have a problem with the car we really need to give you a new car that one has some problems with the brakes or they gave us some bogus excuse can you come down and bring it back
[00:35:45.869 --> 00:35:49.595]  And I guess, lucky for us, the city was already locked down.
[00:35:49.615 --> 00:35:52.058]  If you were in certain areas of the city, you couldn't get out.
[00:35:52.539 --> 00:35:54.262]  You literally could not take the bridges out.
[00:35:54.282 --> 00:35:57.106]  They wouldn't let you leave because of all these dignitaries that were coming in.
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.022]  And Douglas is like, well, we'd really love to come in.
[00:36:01.062 --> 00:36:02.304]  That sounds like a great deal.
[00:36:03.185 --> 00:36:07.169]  But we can't do it because the city's on lockdown and we're pretty busy tomorrow.
[00:36:07.209 --> 00:36:08.951]  So we're not sure we're even going to be able to get there tomorrow.
[00:36:08.971 --> 00:36:11.474]  And the guy's like, look, I'm going to level with you.
[00:36:11.734 --> 00:36:12.655]  I'm not with that.
[00:36:12.815 --> 00:36:14.637]  I'm actually a police officer.
[00:36:15.018 --> 00:36:17.260]  You're now on an FBI terror list.
[00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:20.303]  We were just told by the military that you were staking out their facility.
[00:36:21.084 --> 00:36:22.225]  And we were blown away.
[00:36:22.265 --> 00:36:26.207]  We were actually pretty surprised that nobody came to our hotel room that night.
[00:36:26.227 --> 00:36:31.290]  But I don't think they put two and two together because the hotel wasn't registered under Jason Douglas's name.
[00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:36.093]  But that gives you an idea of what an out of control police state we truly do live in now.
[00:36:36.293 --> 00:36:37.894]  You're not allowed to ask questions.
[00:36:38.415 --> 00:36:41.937]  We no longer have posse comitatus in this country, which is the separation
[00:36:42.597 --> 00:36:43.618]  of the military and police.
[00:36:43.718 --> 00:37:05.033]  I went up to over a dozen military personnel, old and young, and asked them if they could tell me what posse comitatus was, and not one, not one of them, these are the people that are supposed to be swearing their allegiance to the Constitution and Bill of Rights against all enemies foreign and domestic, and not one of them can tell me what posse comitatus is.
[00:37:05.113 --> 00:37:12.118]  I'm featured in this film, so without further ado, we're going to go to the latest and greatest police state trailer right now.
[00:37:16.184 --> 00:37:16.504]  Police!
[00:37:17.245 --> 00:37:18.146]  Tyranny is here.
[00:37:18.507 --> 00:37:22.411]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:37:22.451 --> 00:37:24.674]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:37:24.834 --> 00:37:30.140]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:37:30.541 --> 00:37:36.808]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:37:37.208 --> 00:37:42.752]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:37:43.172 --> 00:37:46.854]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:37:47.355 --> 00:37:51.337]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:37:51.637 --> 00:37:57.161]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:37:57.601 --> 00:38:00.623]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:38:01.143 --> 00:38:02.604]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:38:03.124 --> 00:38:03.565]  It's here.
[00:38:04.225 --> 00:38:11.268]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:18.532]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here for Police State 4 The Rise of FEMA.
[00:38:19.132 --> 00:38:21.994]  It's been almost 8 years since I produced a Police State film.
[00:38:22.574 --> 00:38:24.055]  I made one in 99, one in 2000, and one in 2001.
[00:38:27.452 --> 00:38:32.233]  And unfortunately, everything that we covered in those documentary films has now become reality.
[00:38:32.553 --> 00:38:42.375]  Police State 4 is so important, and is the most powerful of my Police State films, because it proves how a private corporate shadow government has taken over our country.
[00:38:42.735 --> 00:38:53.818]  And it conclusively documents the fact that there is an archipelago of FEMA camps and emergency centers that have been built across the United States, and that they're being expanded.
[00:38:54.298 --> 00:38:55.978]  Everyone needs to see this film.
[00:38:56.345 --> 00:38:58.127]  The people have heard these camps have been built.
[00:38:58.447 --> 00:39:01.169]  They've heard about the National Emergency Centers Act.
[00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:05.853]  They've seen the government hyping how the military needs to be used on the streets of America.
[00:39:06.254 --> 00:39:23.949]  This puts all the pieces of the puzzle together and shows the people what's really being prepared and set up and how the government is planning to stage terror attacks to be blamed on domestic groups as a pretext to begin arresting and interring the American people without due process or habeas corpus.
[00:39:24.389 --> 00:39:30.714]  I am asking everyone to pre-order Police Day 4 The Rise of FEMA at InfoWars.com.
[00:39:31.174 --> 00:39:34.057]  It's coming out in just a few weeks on April 21st.
[00:39:34.637 --> 00:39:40.261]  And once you get the DVD, to make as many copies as you can and to give them to everyone in your community.
[00:39:40.742 --> 00:39:44.645]  Because one thing can stop this conspiracy to take over our society.
[00:39:45.185 --> 00:39:48.167]  One thing can stop what's developing here in the U.S.
[00:39:48.728 --> 00:39:49.749]  We have their blueprint.
[00:39:50.129 --> 00:39:51.470]  We know what their program is.
[00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:54.072]  And if you will simply get this film and make it go
[00:39:54.172 --> 00:39:54.972]  We're good to go.
[00:40:19.444 --> 00:40:23.369]  Or you can buy the super high quality DVDs now at InfoWars.com.
[00:40:23.689 --> 00:40:27.474]  You should pre-order because it's shipped out in the order that your order is received.
[00:40:27.494 --> 00:40:29.696]  So you'll get it first if you pre-order now.
[00:40:29.956 --> 00:40:34.041]  That also supports the filmmakers so we can make more films in the future.
[00:40:34.662 --> 00:40:37.565]  Think of how much good we've done together in the past in the documentaries.
[00:40:37.625 --> 00:40:38.006]  Think of it.
[00:40:38.346 --> 00:40:41.410]  How my films have been seen hundreds of millions of times for free online.
[00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:48.698]  How millions of copies of DVDs have been made by you, the great activists that love freedom out there.
[00:40:48.718 --> 00:40:50.000]  I'm asking you to take action.
[00:40:55.077 --> 00:40:55.417]  I don't know.
[00:41:11.479 --> 00:41:13.141]  There you have it, Police State 4.
[00:41:13.481 --> 00:41:19.247]  Get it over at Infowars.com right now or become a PrisonPlanet.tv member for only $5.95 a month.

[00:41:37.283 --> 00:41:39.063]  $5.95 a month, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:41:39.403 --> 00:41:46.386]  Now I'm going to also show my trailer, Invisible Empire, a new world order to find coming up in the next segment.
[00:41:46.406 --> 00:41:48.067]  But I promised I would take your calls.
[00:41:48.327 --> 00:41:50.788]  So let's go to Redmond in Canada.
[00:41:50.828 --> 00:41:51.568]  Redmond, you're online.
[00:41:53.609 --> 00:41:53.909]  Yes, sir.
[00:41:54.989 --> 00:41:55.389]  Do we have him?
[00:41:58.630 --> 00:42:00.391]  All right, let's go to Dave in West Virginia.
[00:42:02.092 --> 00:42:02.692]  Hey, how you doing?
[00:42:03.266 --> 00:42:03.446]  Good.
[00:42:04.246 --> 00:42:05.827]  Hey, I love your films there, Jason.
[00:42:06.187 --> 00:42:07.067]  Oh, thank you very much.
[00:42:07.087 --> 00:42:08.327]  You're talking about police state.
[00:42:08.347 --> 00:42:18.829]  Something you might want to look into is the mock riot held at the National Corrections and Law Enforcement Training and Technology Center in Moundsville, West Virginia.
[00:42:19.449 --> 00:42:21.090]  It's held at the beginning of each May.
[00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:31.272]  There you can actually witness some training of both civilian and military SWAT teams in crowd control and surveillance.
[00:42:32.385 --> 00:42:35.071]  All the weapons manufacturers, they're selling our goods.
[00:42:36.553 --> 00:42:37.235]  It'd be interesting.
[00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:47.658]  Well, we'll see what we can do to get people out there, but it is so difficult, and that's why we really encourage listeners out there to become the media, to take your little digital camcorders.
[00:42:47.678 --> 00:42:49.039]  It doesn't have to be in high definition.
[00:42:49.079 --> 00:42:58.667]  You can go on eBay right now and pick up a handheld camera for about $100, and let's hold our political officials and our military accountable for what they do.
[00:42:58.727 --> 00:42:59.848]  Get out there with a camera.
[00:43:00.228 --> 00:43:00.989]  Ask the questions.
[00:43:01.249 --> 00:43:02.390]  Become the media.
[00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:03.051]  Anybody can do it.
[00:43:03.091 --> 00:43:06.274]  If a guy like me, who's now only 30 years old, can accomplish
[00:43:06.874 --> 00:43:08.034]  Three plus films.
[00:43:08.094 --> 00:43:12.336]  I've produced one, I've written and directed two, and I was involved with many others.
[00:43:12.376 --> 00:43:14.437]  I'm in the new Police State 4 film.
[00:43:14.737 --> 00:43:19.399]  You can take a couple hours out of your day or week and find out what's going on.
[00:43:19.679 --> 00:43:25.661]  Write an article for PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com and we will post that information.
[00:43:25.681 --> 00:43:26.621]  I thank you for the call.
[00:43:27.102 --> 00:43:29.783]  Let's go to our next caller.
[00:43:31.903 --> 00:43:33.304]  Julio in Illinois.
[00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:37.111]  Jason Furman, how are you this afternoon?
[00:43:37.615 --> 00:43:38.198]  Good, man, good.
[00:43:39.181 --> 00:43:45.564]  Well, it's great to see actual natural clouds here in Illinois today in front of the chemtrails, so I'm just feeling outstanding.
[00:43:46.145 --> 00:43:54.829]  Today, yet another example of our fraudulent President Sotoro signing another peace deal with Russia.
[00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:59.272]  You were talking about how they're fighting for the number one and two spot.
[00:43:59.292 --> 00:44:00.993]  I wonder if you can explain that more.
[00:44:01.153 --> 00:44:08.697]  And secondly, was there an update from Phil J. Berg on when this march in Washington with the birth certificate
[00:44:09.341 --> 00:44:23.008]  Was going to be, and also about these RFID chips, that reconciliation bill, if you could explain that a little bit more, and how our fraudulent government is going to start tracking us with the powers of the IRS.
[00:44:23.108 --> 00:44:29.711]  Also, they're talking about taking our tax returns if we don't pay for new Obamacare.
[00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:31.150]  Well, absolutely.
[00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:38.013]  Let's start at the beginning and talk about the number one and number two spot in the new world order.
[00:44:38.033 --> 00:44:45.516]  You can see a real rift between Russia and the United States in the Georgian conflict that happened a little bit over a year ago.
[00:44:45.556 --> 00:44:48.077]  Remember, Western media started reporting
[00:44:48.737 --> 00:44:52.160]  Georgia has been attacked by Russia through South Ossetia.
[00:44:52.681 --> 00:45:06.293]  Then, as the real information began to trickle in, we found out that, in fact, Georgia, who had the third largest amount of troops in the Middle East under the UN, and they're not part of NATO yet at that point, okay?
[00:45:06.513 --> 00:45:08.535]  They have the third largest amount of troops there.
[00:45:08.795 --> 00:45:11.738]  They're running drills on the South Ossetian border.
[00:45:12.378 --> 00:45:15.239]  With both Israel and the United States.
[00:45:15.539 --> 00:45:18.820]  And all of a sudden they sneak attack South Ossetia.
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:23.102]  Literally slitting throats, knifing people in the back at these bases.
[00:45:24.102 --> 00:45:25.863]  And then Russia feels threatened.
[00:45:26.163 --> 00:45:29.364]  They started running some drills, some counter drills across the way.
[00:45:29.584 --> 00:45:31.965]  And then they're prepared when this happens.
[00:45:32.225 --> 00:45:34.426]  So Russia never really invaded South Ossetia.
[00:45:34.446 --> 00:45:36.927]  They saved South Ossetians from the murder
[00:45:38.533 --> 00:45:39.434]  by Georgians
[00:45:54.992 --> 00:45:55.493]  We're good to go.
[00:46:10.106 --> 00:46:10.646]  The head of it.
[00:46:10.846 --> 00:46:16.388]  Now, I'm not sure what's going on with Phil Berg, and as far as your track, trace, and database comments, it happens every day.
[00:46:16.448 --> 00:46:18.868]  It's been happening for over a decade.
[00:46:18.888 --> 00:46:32.171]  It may not be through RFID technology, although that's part of it, and we do go into RFID technology and implantable human chips in the new movie Invisible Empire, but what we also go into is the case of HEPTING versus AT&T.
[00:46:32.211 --> 00:46:34.952]  You may not be familiar with this, folks, but you should be.
[00:46:35.532 --> 00:46:38.954]  Because if you think warrantless wiretaps are bad, let me explain something to you.
[00:46:39.535 --> 00:46:55.846]  Every single email you put out, every single phone call you make, every IM you type, every website you visit is filtered into National Security Agency databases run by Norris Insight Systems.
[00:46:56.066 --> 00:47:00.008]  I'm sorry if those were big words, but you need to look into it for yourself.
[00:47:00.509 --> 00:47:05.332]  And when over 87 people came forward and filed separate lawsuits
[00:47:06.132 --> 00:47:12.734]  Against people like AT&T and all the other major telecommunication companies out there that were taking part in this.
[00:47:13.394 --> 00:47:17.315]  Mark Klein being their main witness saying, yes, there is a secret room.
[00:47:17.595 --> 00:47:21.776]  Yes, they are tracking, tracing and databasing and analyzing everything you do.
[00:47:22.556 --> 00:47:23.536]  It was thrown out of court.
[00:47:23.576 --> 00:47:24.817]  It went to the Supreme Appeals Court.
[00:47:24.837 --> 00:47:26.437]  It was thrown out of that court as well.
[00:47:26.457 --> 00:47:27.457]  And then Eric Holder.
[00:47:27.617 --> 00:47:32.879]  Remember, this was happening under the Bush administration and continues to happen under the Barack Obama administration.
[00:47:33.099 --> 00:47:34.339]  There is no difference.
[00:47:35.455 --> 00:47:40.442]  They're part of the same conglomerate, the same establishment power.
[00:47:40.863 --> 00:47:42.885]  Eric Holder said, throw them out!
[00:47:43.206 --> 00:47:48.713]  And you don't see Keith Olbermann and the left talking about it anymore now that it's under Obama.
[00:47:48.733 --> 00:47:49.715]  Let's go to our next caller.
[00:47:49.955 --> 00:47:51.938]  Let's go to Ernie in California.
[00:47:52.018 --> 00:47:52.579]  Ernie, you're online.
[00:47:53.737 --> 00:47:54.158]  Hey, Jason.
[00:47:54.859 --> 00:47:55.219]  How are you?
[00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:58.123]  Hey, one thing, I got two things real quick.
[00:47:58.443 --> 00:48:08.317]  First of all, people need to read the 1944 Britain Blitz Conference and realize before World War II, they already had this IMF World Trade Organization already thought up.
[00:48:08.877 --> 00:48:12.199]  Second thing is, I'm going to a tea party in Pleasanton, California.
[00:48:12.239 --> 00:48:14.641]  I want to let everybody know, everybody bring cameras.
[00:48:14.941 --> 00:48:18.023]  And anybody who disturbs anything, follow them to their car.
[00:48:18.363 --> 00:48:24.427]  Find out who, because I have a bad feeling that they're going to try to pull something at the tea party to make us look bad.
[00:48:24.824 --> 00:48:41.816]  Well I would also say this, get a look at their shoes and their boots, because back about two or three years ago, when they were having a protest out in Canada, and of course there were a couple anarchists there, and they had their faces covered, and they were like, let's throw rocks at the cops, I'm gonna throw this rock.
[00:48:42.396 --> 00:48:48.537]  And then he throws the rock at the cops, the cops take him down, and lo and behold, he's wearing the same boots as the police officer!
[00:48:48.737 --> 00:48:58.099]  While the other protesters begged him not to be violent, the agent provocateur who turned out to be a cop, they had to admit it, the next day he was the one causing violence.
[00:48:58.119 --> 00:49:06.540]  And when I was down in the G20 in Pittsburgh, which is all covered in Police State 4, the rise of FEMA, I kept my cameras honed on these anarchists.
[00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:11.521]  These people that were trying to throw paint on people, were throwing bottles and cans at one another.
[00:49:11.881 --> 00:49:13.662]  That's not how you take action.
[00:49:13.842 --> 00:49:17.003]  Look, Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:49:17.083 --> 00:49:18.503]  had the right idea.
[00:49:18.783 --> 00:49:21.164]  Massive civil disobedience.
[00:49:22.145 --> 00:49:25.026]  When an idea's time has come, there is no stopping it.
[00:49:25.646 --> 00:49:27.666]  But as Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:49:27.686 --> 00:49:31.708]  said, there does become a time when silence is betrayal.
[00:49:31.748 --> 00:49:33.689]  And I believe we are well beyond that point.
[00:49:33.709 --> 00:49:35.109]  So we need to have our voices heard.
[00:49:35.309 --> 00:49:37.730]  We need to have our cameras honed.
[00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:39.130]  on these situations.
[00:49:39.171 --> 00:49:42.372]  We need to get out to these tea parties and talk about real issues.
[00:49:42.412 --> 00:49:43.532]  Hand out real films.
[00:49:43.812 --> 00:49:48.414]  Hand out my film, Fabled Enemies, to somebody that doesn't understand what 9-11 truth is really about.
[00:49:48.594 --> 00:49:54.137]  They only hear the mainstream talking points that are complete and total propaganda to try to marginalize us.
[00:49:54.497 --> 00:50:04.301]  Give them Endgame so that they can understand the program for depopulation, not only in third and second world nations, but coming to a household near you.
[00:50:04.381 --> 00:50:06.702]  All right, let's go to Mark in Pennsylvania.
[00:50:06.742 --> 00:50:07.362]  Mark, you're online.
[00:50:08.547 --> 00:50:10.588]  Great work, great work, Jason.
[00:50:11.168 --> 00:50:17.531]  This is Mark the Spark in Philadelphia, sparking and fanning the brush fires of the mining, doing my part to spread the word.
[00:50:18.112 --> 00:50:26.776]  What I'd like to talk about briefly is on the subject of, it's about money, and money is used as a control mechanism.
[00:50:27.296 --> 00:50:29.557]  As an example, I'm originally from Southern Missouri.
[00:50:30.157 --> 00:50:33.299]  My family, one of my family members worked at General Electric.
[00:50:33.854 --> 00:50:36.737]  Mark Holdover, we're going to come back to you.
[00:50:36.757 --> 00:50:37.557]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:37.577 --> 00:50:39.699]  I am Jason Burmas, sitting in.
[00:50:39.719 --> 00:50:41.401]  We'll be back after this.
[00:50:41.421 --> 00:50:42.382]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:51:49.481 --> 00:51:51.824]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:51:51.844 --> 00:51:54.227]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:06.461 --> 00:52:11.202]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:11.562 --> 00:52:15.783]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:16.083 --> 00:52:18.423]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:18.443 --> 00:52:20.964]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:20.984 --> 00:52:23.884]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:24.225 --> 00:52:31.826]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:32.166 --> 00:52:37.411]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:37.551 --> 00:52:39.833]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:39.873 --> 00:52:43.837]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:44.097 --> 00:52:45.018]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:45.178 --> 00:52:46.459]  You're everyone else.

[00:54:04.995 --> 00:54:05.815]  We are back!
[00:54:05.835 --> 00:54:06.776]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:06.836 --> 00:54:08.416]  I am Jason Bermas, sitting in.
[00:54:08.436 --> 00:54:19.119]  We're about to go back to Mark in Pennsylvania in just a moment to tell the horrors of how you can pay into a pension for 25 to 30 years and then General Electric will just sell the company and guess what?
[00:54:19.199 --> 00:54:20.360]  You get nothing.
[00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:23.561]  But I want to thank one of the great sponsors out there, AcolaBlue.com.
[00:54:23.581 --> 00:54:27.802]  That's AcolaBlue.com.
[00:54:27.822 --> 00:54:28.282]  1-800-691-6043.
[00:54:28.522 --> 00:54:32.243]  Did you know you could be drinking fresh, clean water made right out of the air you breathe?
[00:54:32.283 --> 00:54:34.044]  No, it isn't something out of a science fiction book.
[00:54:34.404 --> 00:54:35.745]  Yes, so to continue, at the time
[00:55:03.135 --> 00:55:09.060]  It was my sister who was due to get a pension at the 25 year mark, six months prior to that.
[00:55:10.581 --> 00:55:14.564]  Also a little bit of background, about the same time that she hired on, a lot of other people hired on.
[00:55:14.584 --> 00:55:17.146]  So they had a lot of people that were hired on at the same time.
[00:55:17.786 --> 00:55:24.071]  So it's about the six months before she was due to get that, along with a lot of other co-workers.
[00:55:24.091 --> 00:55:27.434]  GE sold the company to a subsidiary.
[00:55:28.121 --> 00:55:31.042]  And now, she will get less than one-third.
[00:55:31.102 --> 00:55:32.762]  Before, she would have gotten close to $2,000.
[00:55:33.042 --> 00:55:37.003]  Now, she will get $600 a month if she takes her pension.
[00:55:37.583 --> 00:55:38.323]  Okay?
[00:55:38.763 --> 00:55:40.763]  And so, now this is the other part of it.
[00:55:42.243 --> 00:55:51.705]  In Southern Missouri, General Electric, every time it came time around for them to vote for the union, they voted it down.
[00:55:52.065 --> 00:55:53.105]  They voted it down.
[00:55:53.445 --> 00:55:54.366]  They voted it down.
[00:55:54.426 --> 00:55:56.786]  And that's the thanks that they get from General Electric.
[00:55:57.729 --> 00:56:02.906]  And along that time was when Jack Welch was writing all of his books and getting all of his stupendous
[00:56:03.627 --> 00:56:09.750]  Outrageous fortunes from, you know, being such a great leader of a company.
[00:56:09.790 --> 00:56:17.234]  We have to realize, first of all, Mark, that GE is one of the top military industrial complex companies out there.
[00:56:17.294 --> 00:56:21.356]  They're the owners of NBC and they are a huge gatekeeper.
[00:56:21.376 --> 00:56:23.477]  They don't care about the little guy at all.
[00:56:23.717 --> 00:56:30.440]  If anybody's seen Michael Moore's Capitalism, which I think is really wrongly named and wrongly directed, it's really about
[00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:31.420]  Globalism.
[00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:49.508]  When they look at the internal Citigroup documents, that's Citigroup, the bank, they refer to us as peasants and that we are in a plutonomy and that their model is the rich continuing to get richer over time as the poor continue to get poorer with no end in sight.
[00:56:49.569 --> 00:56:50.349]  I thank you for the call.
[00:56:50.569 --> 00:56:52.850]  We're going to go to Myron in South Dakota.
[00:56:52.890 --> 00:56:56.051]  Myron, you're on the line.
[00:56:56.111 --> 00:56:56.512]  Yes, Jason.
[00:56:56.812 --> 00:56:57.092]  Yes, sir.
[00:56:58.166 --> 00:56:59.887]  You know, I'm kind of disappointed.
[00:56:59.907 --> 00:57:07.370]  I was hoping you guys would cover a big event that took place a couple weeks ago, the Commodity Future Trading Commission.
[00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:10.051]  I watched the whole five and a half hours.
[00:57:10.271 --> 00:57:11.852]  It was mind-blowing.
[00:57:12.052 --> 00:57:15.153]  Well, give us a little wrap-up in about one minute before we go to break.
[00:57:15.173 --> 00:57:15.934]  Tell us what it's about.
[00:57:15.954 --> 00:57:25.958]  Okay, Bill Murphy and Adrian Douglas were there from GATA, and it seems they were contacted by a whistleblower from London.
[00:57:26.443 --> 00:57:29.244]  A trader, commodity trader, named Andrew McGuire.
[00:57:29.864 --> 00:57:40.948]  Andrew McGuire had been working with the Commodity Future Trading, telling them when JPMorgan and HSBC were going to short the market and take the market down.
[00:57:40.968 --> 00:57:46.670]  He even gave them the date, the time they were going to do it, and they wouldn't do anything about it.
[00:57:47.211 --> 00:57:53.813]  Well, anyhow, Bill Murphy relayed this right at the committee hearing, and it was just a mind-boggler.
[00:57:54.318 --> 00:58:08.569]  Well, anyway, the next day Andrew McGuire and his wife were driving down the streets of London and were hit broadside by a hit-and-run driver, and the GADDA had a number of interviews lined up with the regular media.
[00:58:09.282 --> 00:58:12.023]  And all of those were cancelled the following morning.
[00:58:12.403 --> 00:58:25.006]  Well that does sound more than interesting and we also know that the only insider trading they actually do go after is the little guy, are these media events like Diana or Martha Stewart and others.
[00:58:25.327 --> 00:58:28.447]  They don't go after the big dogs and they don't want their corruption to be exposed.
[00:58:28.948 --> 00:58:29.648]  Appreciate the call.
[00:58:29.668 --> 00:58:33.469]  We're going to have Peter Dale Scott coming up after this and the Invisible Empire trailer.
[00:58:33.489 --> 00:58:34.349]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:34.409 --> 00:58:37.110]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:39.864 --> 00:58:41.730]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:43.376 --> 00:58:45.623]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:48.854 --> 00:58:51.456]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:58:51.857 --> 00:58:56.821]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:58:57.201 --> 00:58:58.923]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:58:59.243 --> 00:59:04.067]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:59:04.248 --> 00:59:05.208]  How much do you want?
[00:59:05.429 --> 00:59:06.169]  When do you want it?
[00:59:06.550 --> 00:59:08.151]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:59:08.431 --> 00:59:09.272]  When will you need it?
[00:59:09.512 --> 00:59:11.574]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:59:11.714 --> 00:59:12.815]  Will there be any food?
[00:59:13.055 --> 00:59:14.397]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:59:14.577 --> 00:59:14.937]  If there's a
[00:59:14.977 --> 00:59:16.939]  Quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[00:59:17.099 --> 00:59:19.642]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:59:19.822 --> 00:59:23.026]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:59:23.426 --> 00:59:26.910]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:59:27.231 --> 00:59:28.232]  How much will you need?
[00:59:28.472 --> 00:59:29.073]  We don't know.
[00:59:29.373 --> 00:59:30.294]  How much do you want?
[00:59:30.474 --> 00:59:31.195]  All you can get.
[00:59:31.215 --> 00:59:31.796]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:32.496 --> 00:59:35.258]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:59:35.538 --> 00:59:37.740]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:38.740]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:39.901]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:39.941 --> 00:59:41.782]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:07.171]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:07.811 --> 01:00:08.632]  You want answers?
[01:00:09.392 --> 01:00:10.332]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:10.952 --> 01:00:14.613]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:15.134 --> 01:00:19.195]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:19.975 --> 01:00:21.217]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:21.277 --> 01:00:24.782]  I am Jason Vermas, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.882 --> 01:00:35.616]  It is April 8th, 2010, and we are currently joined by Peter Dale Scott, author, historian, and poet, and we're going to get to him in just a moment.
[01:00:35.936 --> 01:00:38.117]  As well as his latest article, Can the U.S.
[01:00:38.177 --> 01:00:41.019]  Triumph in the Drug Addicted War in Afghanistan?
[01:00:41.439 --> 01:00:44.441]  Opium, the CIA, and the Karzai Administration.
[01:00:44.461 --> 01:00:57.049]  But Mr. Scott is actually featured in my latest and I believe greatest documentary to date, Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined, released April 15th here first at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:00:57.389 --> 01:01:00.511]  So we're going to show you a trailer and come back to Mr. Scott.
[01:01:12.914 --> 01:01:14.495]  Adolf Hitler, he wanted a world government.
[01:01:15.815 --> 01:01:18.537]  With himself as the master leader.
[01:01:20.278 --> 01:01:28.762]  One small central authority of individuals can then dictate a policy that's going to be distributed down to the rest of the world, everywhere.
[01:01:29.923 --> 01:01:33.585]  The Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the world's superclass.
[01:01:34.525 --> 01:01:41.229]  This documentary chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:01:41.589 --> 01:01:51.855]  We've become accustomed to the idea that every now and then something is going to happen and we just know from the beginning we're not going to get to the bottom of it.
[01:01:53.587 --> 01:02:02.051]  Learn how this global oligarchy controls the populace through drug trafficking, money laundering, staged terror attacks, media propaganda, and tent.
[01:02:02.431 --> 01:02:09.975]  Americans are easily motivated by false flag operations and I think it's inevitable that we will see false flag operations in the near future.
[01:02:10.335 --> 01:02:17.539]  Witness their plan for a global tax and a cashless surveillance society in which every man, woman, and child is microchipped at birth.
[01:02:17.759 --> 01:02:19.440]  A network Washington set up to
[01:02:23.201 --> 01:02:37.225]  Bonnie Frank acknowledged having used a male prostitute whom he then hired as a personal employee and he ran a prostitution business out of Frank's home.
[01:02:37.345 --> 01:02:44.547]  If you look at the elite throughout history, many of the people that achieve pinnacles of power are into the occult.
[01:02:44.767 --> 01:02:47.368]  Stories about what happens in these redwoods are hard to come by.
[01:02:54.455 --> 01:02:57.916]  Invisible Empire, a new world order to find.
[01:02:58.797 --> 01:03:07.680]  Secure your copy of Invisible Empire on DVD at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com or see it in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:03:10.416 --> 01:03:14.919]  And we are back at the Alex Jones Show, and we are joined by Peter Dale Scott.
[01:03:14.999 --> 01:03:17.780]  And again, his latest article is, Can the U.S.
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:20.522]  Triumph in a Drug-Addicted War in Afghanistan?
[01:03:20.862 --> 01:03:23.404]  Opium, the CIA, and the Karzai Administration.
[01:03:23.424 --> 01:03:27.806]  Since we're going to break in about 90 seconds, Peter, why did you write this article?
[01:03:28.727 --> 01:03:37.272]  Well, it was actually, you know, I have a good friend, Al McCoy, who wrote the definitive book about CIA and drugs called The Politics of Heroin.
[01:03:38.012 --> 01:03:39.473]  It's now in its third edition.
[01:03:40.517 --> 01:03:53.988]  But he just published an article on Tom Dispatch, and I thought that he was underplaying the role of the CIA in the spread of the global drug trafficking since World War II.
[01:03:54.528 --> 01:04:06.277]  In fact, as you can learn from his book, the CIA and a forgotten adjunct of it, the OPC Office of Policy Coordination,
[01:04:06.869 --> 01:04:17.572]  actually built up the drug trade in Burma to create a local force to stop the Chinese Communists from moving south into Southeast Asia.
[01:04:18.152 --> 01:04:22.874]  And there's been continuous relationship between the CIA and the drug traffic since.
[01:04:23.014 --> 01:04:33.557]  So what happened in Afghanistan, originally in the 80s, and then again in 2001, the CIA went to that country twice and helped build up the drug traffic there.
[01:04:34.349 --> 01:04:37.131]  And that is so key to understanding.
[01:04:37.191 --> 01:04:44.697]  In this article, it explains that prior to 2001, the opium production out of Afghanistan was about 185 tons.
[01:04:44.737 --> 01:04:48.440]  How does it turn into 4,600 tons so quickly?
[01:04:48.461 --> 01:04:50.302]  We'll be back after this with Peter Dale Scott.
[01:04:50.342 --> 01:04:53.605]  It's the Alex Jones Show, PrisonPlanet.TV, InfoWars.com.
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:04:59.380]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:04.762]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:05:05.002 --> 01:05:09.624]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:05:10.024 --> 01:05:15.046]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:05:15.586 --> 01:05:20.287]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:05:20.808 --> 01:05:27.730]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:05:27.930 --> 01:05:28.830]  And here's the best part.
[01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:35.412]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:05:35.732 --> 01:05:38.574]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:05:38.915 --> 01:05:40.796]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[01:07:58.606 --> 01:08:03.668]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:03.988 --> 01:08:06.289]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:08.758 --> 01:08:10.619]  We are back at the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:10.719 --> 01:08:12.801]  I am Jason Bermas sitting in.
[01:08:12.821 --> 01:08:24.588]  We are joined by Peter Dale Scott who I sat down with last October and he was gracious enough to give me an hour and 40 minute interview for my film Invisible Empire and New World Order Defined.
[01:08:25.448 --> 01:08:31.152]  And one of the things we did talk about was CIA involvement in drug running in the past and even
[01:08:31.972 --> 01:09:00.009]  Today in modern times, but at the time this New York Times article had not come out yet and you were actually alluding to this in our interview saying that there had been some Russian journalists and sources out there that said that we were very much involved in the opium trade in Afghanistan and then we had this headline October 28, 2009, brother of Afghan leader said to be paid by the CIA and this is of course Ahmed Wali Karzai, you go into this later,
[01:09:00.769 --> 01:09:14.636]  In the article, Peter, but how is it that we've set up an infrastructure that is openly using a drug lord who just happens to be our puppet dictator's brother as the lead opium dealer in the region?
[01:09:14.696 --> 01:09:15.436]  How does this happen?
[01:09:16.177 --> 01:09:23.000]  Well, twice over, first time in 1979 and again in 2001 after 9-11, the CIA went into Afghanistan
[01:09:27.778 --> 01:09:34.003]  It didn't have very many assets there to choose from, and the assets it chose happened to be drug traffickers.
[01:09:34.884 --> 01:09:49.256]  And its hands were not totally free in this matter, because the first time, which was the crucial decision in 1979, it was trying to stay as remotely from operations as possible.
[01:09:49.356 --> 01:09:56.942]  So it supplied a great deal of money to what we call the ISI, which is the Pakistan Intelligence Service.
[01:09:57.628 --> 01:10:07.491]  Pakistan was actually frightened of Afghan independence because there's an unresolved border issue between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[01:10:08.191 --> 01:10:18.194]  So Pakistan gave the money, or more than half of the money, to its preferred client, who had a base in Pakistan but not in Afghanistan.
[01:10:18.854 --> 01:10:26.056]  And he became, with the aid of CIA money, perhaps the world's largest heroin trafficker in the 1980s.
[01:10:27.458 --> 01:10:35.641]  He not only was dealing in opium, but he developed the heroin lab in ISI territory in Pakistan.
[01:10:36.241 --> 01:10:55.028]  And if you go back to that period, 1979, what we call the Golden Crescent wasn't a factor in the world drug traffic at all, which is amazing when you consider that now something like 90 or 93% of the world's heroin is coming from Afghanistan itself.
[01:10:56.014 --> 01:11:03.242]  And it went up very quickly from an insignificant amount to, well, 2007 was the peak year, 8,200 tons.
[01:11:03.302 --> 01:11:05.764]  You mentioned that that was a huge buildup from 2001, when it was only 185 tons.
[01:11:17.378 --> 01:11:32.465]  I think, in all fairness, we ought to compare the 8,000 figure with 2,000 rather than 2,001, because that 185-ton figure was a record low in the last two decades.
[01:11:33.005 --> 01:11:37.047]  The Taliban was desperate to get world recognition.
[01:11:37.067 --> 01:11:40.008]  It was only recognized by three countries at that time.
[01:11:40.623 --> 01:11:48.751]  And so it just made a point of using its own brutal methods to stamp out the drug trade in Afghanistan.
[01:11:48.771 --> 01:11:59.500]  185 tons was from the, most of that, nearly all of it, was from the area of Afghanistan that the Taliban did not yet control.
[01:12:00.241 --> 01:12:02.984]  And then in 2001 we went back in, so we, I say Washington,
[01:12:07.017 --> 01:12:16.964]  Made a conscious decision to ally itself with the Northern Alliance, who were responsible for the drugs still being grown in Afghanistan.
[01:12:17.004 --> 01:12:28.532]  They went in with the aid of drug traffickers, and that has colored the nature of the relationship we have in that country ever since.
[01:12:29.012 --> 01:12:30.353]  This is not the first time.
[01:12:30.433 --> 01:12:32.995]  I mean, something very like this happened in Vietnam.
[01:12:33.115 --> 01:12:35.316]  The American went into Vietnam in the 1950s.
[01:12:36.897 --> 01:12:43.822]  He had no real allies there and installed a puppet, really, not in him.
[01:12:44.483 --> 01:12:49.106]  And with very little popular base, he relied on his brother.
[01:12:49.166 --> 01:13:04.498]  This is just as Ahmed Khalil Karzai relies on his brother, Ahmed Wali, to deliver the votes, organize the countryside.
[01:13:05.477 --> 01:13:14.144]  And let me just stop you there, Peter, because that's actually in the mainstream news just yesterday.
[01:13:14.224 --> 01:13:26.274]  I was watching Wolf Blitzer and the Cafferty Report was coming on, and they were discussing how not only does Waleed Karzai deal this opium, but he also rigs the elections for his brother.
[01:13:26.294 --> 01:13:27.375]  They were laughing about it.
[01:13:27.415 --> 01:13:28.956]  It was like an inside joke to them.
[01:13:28.976 --> 01:13:32.059]  They said, oh, I wonder if his brother is helping to rig the elections.
[01:13:32.259 --> 01:13:33.340]  This isn't very funny to me.
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:38.345]  Well, history repeated becomes farce, I guess, because this is what we had in Vietnam.
[01:13:38.365 --> 01:13:47.134]  Ngo Dinh Nhu ran the drug trade, was a CIA asset, and faked an election for his brother Ngo Dinh Diem.
[01:13:48.496 --> 01:13:54.743]  You know, yes, it's painful that we say that we're doing this as a fight for democracy,
[01:13:55.390 --> 01:14:00.275]  It's actually meaningless to bring democracy to a country like Afghanistan.
[01:14:00.315 --> 01:14:02.657]  It's not even really a state in our sense.
[01:14:02.737 --> 01:14:04.098]  It's a collection of tribes.
[01:14:05.039 --> 01:14:20.093]  And it always had a certain amount of violence built into it, but it was a much more benign state of affairs before we started meddling, and particularly before we pumped all this money in
[01:14:20.926 --> 01:14:29.651]  behind the drug traffic because the drug traffickers are much more ruthless than the traditional tribal elders who have their own code of behavior.
[01:14:30.451 --> 01:14:38.816]  And the idea that we can just go into a country and impose something on it and expect people to like us is ridiculous.
[01:14:38.956 --> 01:14:48.301]  It's like the British Red Coats coming to America in the 1770s and expecting to get rid of these miscreants like George Washington.
[01:14:48.361 --> 01:14:49.382]  It wasn't going to happen.
[01:14:49.781 --> 01:15:07.135]  And again, instead of ending these wars like the Obama administration had promised, he's actually sent tens of thousands of new troops into Afghanistan and the media propaganda that that's where the real fight is has really been thrust upon the people in the last 18 to 24 months.
[01:15:07.155 --> 01:15:08.256]  We have to be in Afghanistan.
[01:15:08.276 --> 01:15:09.817]  We have to have more troops in Afghanistan.
[01:15:10.037 --> 01:15:12.059]  Well, I think Obama faces a very tough decision in the future.
[01:15:12.079 --> 01:15:15.002]  He might be, for all I know, I can't read his mind, he might be sincere.
[01:15:32.145 --> 01:15:48.274]  In thinking that he's going to pull the troops out, because certainly the most sensible thing for him to do, given what he has done, which is put, you know, we now have 100,000 troops there, and also don't forget, 100,000 mercenaries.
[01:15:48.414 --> 01:15:53.777]  Blackwater still has contracts with the government, now called Zay, but it's the old Blackwater.
[01:15:54.457 --> 01:15:56.238]  And there are other private firms.
[01:15:56.258 --> 01:15:57.839]  It's 200,000 troops, and that's not enough.
[01:16:02.044 --> 01:16:05.887]  by counter-insurgency doctrine to pacify the country.
[01:16:06.428 --> 01:16:13.273]  It's not even enough to pacify the pastoral southern half of it, which is the basic source of the problem.
[01:16:13.733 --> 01:16:31.287]  I think he may think, and he may have been advised that he should pull out, but I agree with Andrew Bacevich that once you unleash the dogs of war, it's not so easy to haul them back in, and America is going to find itself in a position, I will predict this,
[01:16:32.065 --> 01:16:56.447]  That in 2011, which was the year where he said he would begin to start pulling the troops back out, the situation is going to be at least as messy as it is now, and there's going to be a great deal of pressure on him, both from inside the country and from the area of Pakistan and Afghanistan itself.
[01:16:57.399 --> 01:16:58.240]  Uh, to stay in.
[01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:04.666]  In fact, the situation in Pakistan may be worse for all I know, because it's a very unstable country right now.
[01:17:05.227 --> 01:17:14.076]  And you know, you just mentioned that it would be like the Redcoats coming into America, what the United States has done in Afghanistan.
[01:17:14.136 --> 01:17:19.321]  I want to get your take on the video that was recently released this week of
[01:17:20.512 --> 01:17:37.023]  Really, soldiers being judge, jury and executioner from the sky on not only Reuters reporters, but then when one of them seemed to survive, they opened up on a van with two children in the front seat of the car when no weapons were in sight.
[01:17:37.043 --> 01:17:38.504]  They kept saying, do you see a weapon?
[01:17:38.564 --> 01:17:39.465]  No, I don't see a weapon.
[01:17:39.705 --> 01:17:40.665]  Is he going for a weapon?
[01:17:40.726 --> 01:17:41.786]  Is he going for a weapon?
[01:17:42.146 --> 01:17:42.767]  Engage.
[01:17:42.847 --> 01:17:44.628]  And then they gunned that van down.
[01:17:45.088 --> 01:17:47.310]  Of course, this is going to create an insurgency.
[01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:50.412]  Of course, this is going to create a dislike of the
[01:17:51.893 --> 01:18:04.800]  Well, I'm glad that film got released, and I hope that the people listening to this show will make a point of finding it on Google, because it is a lesson in what war is like.
[01:18:05.621 --> 01:18:15.787]  Particularly a war where, as is the case here in both Iraq and Afghanistan, our troops fighting there have very, very little
[01:18:17.157 --> 01:18:19.178]  Exposure to the culture of the country.
[01:18:19.198 --> 01:18:21.418]  I'm talking about the people on the ground now.
[01:18:21.478 --> 01:18:23.059]  They're going in, raiding homes.
[01:18:23.119 --> 01:18:25.599]  They can't talk to these people.
[01:18:25.659 --> 01:18:32.321]  They rely on interpreters who are often not the most reliable people around.
[01:18:33.121 --> 01:18:35.902]  And there are so many other things to see on the web.
[01:18:35.942 --> 01:18:39.043]  There's another story on the web about Fallujah.
[01:18:39.943 --> 01:18:41.624]  Fallujah was the city which
[01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:52.644]  America made a point of attacking heavily in 2004, and created a great number of civilian casualties.
[01:18:52.764 --> 01:19:07.390]  And there's an article now about, because they used updated uranium in the weaponry there, and they also used the, they used a lot of new weapons, which probably by UN standards are illegal weapons.
[01:19:08.150 --> 01:19:11.612]  And what really, what really horrifies me
[01:19:13.076 --> 01:19:27.422]  I'd forgotten it, but at the time the New York Times reported that we had bombed a civilian hospital, and the reason that America bombed a hospital in Fallujah was because it was the source
[01:19:28.050 --> 01:19:32.474]  Of what the Times called rumors that there were large numbers of civilian casualties.
[01:19:32.594 --> 01:19:36.058]  Well, there were large numbers of civilian casualties.
[01:19:36.138 --> 01:19:38.520]  And these are not isolated incidents, Peter.
[01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:42.043]  We have to point out that these are happening more and more and more.
[01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:44.566]  And our military is shielding them from view.
[01:19:44.626 --> 01:19:47.709]  If we didn't have WikiLeaks, this wouldn't even be out there.
[01:19:47.749 --> 01:19:48.770]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:49.911]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in.
[01:19:50.151 --> 01:19:51.873]  We'll be back after this with Peter Dale Scott.
[01:19:59.133 --> 01:20:03.394]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[01:20:03.734 --> 01:20:11.276]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over four years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey guy offers amazing specials for Berkey water systems.
[01:20:11.536 --> 01:20:26.319]  The revolutionary Berkey light systems include a set of self-sterilizing and re-cleanable black purification elements that purify water by removing chlorine, pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels and removes harmful chemicals such as herbicides and pesticides.

[01:20:58.621 --> 01:21:01.342]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[01:21:01.582 --> 01:21:05.523]  Are we going to see economic growth, slide into a recession, or at worst, depression?
[01:21:05.723 --> 01:21:07.804]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:21:07.984 --> 01:21:13.026]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[01:21:13.146 --> 01:21:14.926]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[01:21:14.986 --> 01:21:16.327]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[01:21:16.527 --> 01:21:17.987]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[01:21:18.007 --> 01:21:21.108]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[01:21:21.388 --> 01:21:26.410]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:27.130]  We're good to go.
[01:21:44.737 --> 01:21:45.619]  We're good to go.
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:03.604]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:22:03.644 --> 01:22:06.367]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:22:06.407 --> 01:22:10.930]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:22:11.771 --> 01:22:16.234]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from infowars.com.

[01:24:05.007 --> 01:24:14.077]  9-11 and the American Empire, deep politics, and JFK, and of course the war conspiracy are just some of the books that Peter Dale Scott has authored.
[01:24:14.117 --> 01:24:15.058]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:15.198 --> 01:24:18.602]  I am Jason Burmess, sitting in, talking with Peter.
[01:24:19.563 --> 01:24:22.224]  And Peter, these aren't isolated incidents.
[01:24:22.284 --> 01:24:27.206]  These are just the ones that are caught on film and sometimes, sometimes leaked to the public.
[01:24:27.626 --> 01:24:35.189]  And without an organization like WikiLeaks that has been targeted by intelligence, we wouldn't know about these things.
[01:24:35.329 --> 01:24:41.252]  And one of the things that you said in the interview that I'm probably going to be paraphrasing right now that I did include in my film is,
[01:24:41.852 --> 01:24:54.740]  With the continuity of government program, with non-constitutional authorities in control, we somehow have to mobilize a mass movement, and we have to use the technology at our fingertips, a.k.a.
[01:24:55.121 --> 01:24:55.741]  the Internet.
[01:24:55.861 --> 01:24:57.822]  And that's what WikiLeaks and others have done.
[01:24:57.862 --> 01:24:58.623]  Can you speak to that?
[01:24:59.203 --> 01:25:00.564]  Yes, well, I think it's true.
[01:25:00.624 --> 01:25:11.171]  I mean, the big difference between these two wars we have now, Iraq and Afghanistan, and the Vietnam War back in the 60s and 70s, was that
[01:25:12.434 --> 01:25:17.096]  The press was, compared to today, relatively independent.
[01:25:17.116 --> 01:25:26.718]  It wasn't totally independent, but there were journalists who came back and were reporting the truth about Vietnam, even in the New York Times.
[01:25:27.419 --> 01:25:32.500]  And the Pentagon has taken major steps to make sure that never happens again.
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:34.701]  So now all the journalists are embedded.
[01:25:35.381 --> 01:25:40.443]  And thank goodness we have the Internet, which is performing today the role which the
[01:25:42.509 --> 01:25:48.133]  Journalists like David Halberstam and Malcolm Brown performed back in the 60s.
[01:25:48.233 --> 01:25:54.918]  So yes, I think as citizens it's our duty if we are loyal to the country.
[01:25:56.199 --> 01:26:01.162]  I say this as a Canadian, but I feel loyal to America, the country.
[01:26:01.543 --> 01:26:07.627]  It's a duty to inform ourselves about the realities in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:26:08.220 --> 01:26:36.052]  Wikileaks, I just tested, if you just type Google for Wikileaks, you get right away the video that Jason was talking about a minute ago, or if you type in William Blum and Fallujah, F-A-L-L-U-J-A-H, you will get this story that Bill Blum has just done about how now there are an appalling number of birth defects in Fallujah because of the
[01:26:37.618 --> 01:26:43.021]  Really illegal munitions, like depleted uranium, that were used there.
[01:26:43.101 --> 01:26:49.484]  So, what we need are citizens informing themselves by going to the Internet.
[01:26:50.164 --> 01:27:00.849]  And I'm hopeful, in my book, The Road to 9-11, it's filled with depressing facts, but I'm not really a pessimist.
[01:27:01.009 --> 01:27:04.331]  I'm an optimist about this country, because there are decent people in it.
[01:27:04.878 --> 01:27:23.084]  But I think that we have to appeal to the decency of Americans of all stripes to say, although Americans disagree with each other all the time, that's the flavor of life in this country, that there should be also some things which we agree upon and bring us together.
[01:27:23.564 --> 01:27:26.345]  We don't want a country that tortures.
[01:27:26.445 --> 01:27:31.707]  We don't want a government that invades foreign countries gratuitously.
[01:27:31.727 --> 01:27:33.828]  Well, not exactly gratuitously.
[01:27:34.352 --> 01:27:43.815]  But for hidden motives like oil, and that the polls claim that there are weapons of mass destruction there.
[01:27:43.855 --> 01:27:49.696]  Let me just stop you just for a second, Peter, because oil, you know, they used to say, oh, we're not there for the oil.
[01:27:49.776 --> 01:27:55.738]  I literally on CNN yesterday saw a commercial pushing the new green economy.
[01:27:56.118 --> 01:27:59.800]  Yeah, well, I think the best proof that we went in for the oil is, as I say in my book, The Road to 9-11.
[01:28:26.845 --> 01:28:54.684]  Before 9-11, in the very first month of the George W. Bush first administration, Cheney was set up in charge of a task force on energy, and even though it was a public body, they released almost no documents from that task force, but they did release two after a bitter court fight.
[01:28:55.487 --> 01:29:00.771]  And these were two maps of Iraq, which were all sliced up, showing where the oil was.
[01:29:01.391 --> 01:29:02.752]  Well, this is January.
[01:29:02.892 --> 01:29:12.099]  I mean, we had no reason to be at war with Iraq then, but they were planning then how to divide up the oil.
[01:29:12.219 --> 01:29:22.306]  And the first administrator who was sent there in 2003, he had a sort of free enterprise notion that the American country
[01:29:22.785 --> 01:29:29.751]  companies to come in right away and take over the oil field, which produced a lot of reaction in Iraq, obviously.
[01:29:30.431 --> 01:29:36.055]  Peter Dale Scott actually highlights massive amounts of this very damning evidence in his many books.
[01:29:36.095 --> 01:29:49.026]  We're going to come back after the break and take your call specifically for Peter, and I also want to get into the money laundering aspect of this drug running out of Afghanistan, whether it be BCCI of yesteryear.
[01:29:49.046 --> 01:29:49.726]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.227 --> 01:29:51.728]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.714 --> 01:29:55.475]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.056 --> 01:30:02.038]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:30:02.278 --> 01:30:03.158]  Tyranny is here.
[01:30:03.538 --> 01:30:07.099]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:09.680]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:15.162]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:30:15.563 --> 01:30:21.805]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:22.225 --> 01:30:27.769]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:30:28.210 --> 01:30:31.872]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:30:32.393 --> 01:30:36.376]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:30:36.656 --> 01:30:42.180]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:45.763]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:30:46.183 --> 01:30:47.604]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:30:48.144 --> 01:30:48.585]  It's here.

[01:31:04.975 --> 01:31:09.738]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:31:10.119 --> 01:31:16.583]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:31:18.834 --> 01:31:25.181]  They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[01:31:27.199 --> 01:31:31.240]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:35.061]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[01:31:35.761 --> 01:31:36.601]  Others don't.

[01:31:58.393 --> 01:32:00.995]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:32:01.395 --> 01:32:06.359]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:08.461]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:32:08.781 --> 01:32:13.585]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:32:13.785 --> 01:32:14.726]  How much do you want?
[01:32:14.966 --> 01:32:15.707]  When do you want it?
[01:32:16.087 --> 01:32:17.689]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:32:17.969 --> 01:32:18.789]  When will you need it?
[01:32:19.050 --> 01:32:21.111]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:32:21.251 --> 01:32:22.352]  Will there be any food?
[01:32:22.593 --> 01:32:23.934]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:32:24.114 --> 01:32:24.394]  If there's
[01:32:24.414 --> 01:32:26.475]  There's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[01:32:26.635 --> 01:32:29.176]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:32:29.356 --> 01:32:32.557]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:32.937 --> 01:32:36.439]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:32:36.759 --> 01:32:37.759]  How much will you need?
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:38.600]  We don't know.
[01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:39.800]  How much do you want?
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:40.721]  All you can get.
[01:32:40.741 --> 01:32:41.601]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:32:41.701 --> 01:32:42.081]  We're good.
[01:33:06.019 --> 01:33:06.880]  We are back!
[01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:07.661]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:07.681 --> 01:33:09.422]  I am Jason Bermas, sitting in.
[01:33:09.462 --> 01:33:15.968]  Before we go back to Peter Dale Scott and take your calls for Peter, I want to thank one of our great sponsors, eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:33:15.988 --> 01:33:17.850]  That's eFoodsDirect.com 1-800-409-5633.
[01:33:18.210 --> 01:33:22.474]  Okay, so we don't have to remind you that you need food to survive.
[01:33:22.534 --> 01:33:27.979]  Our biggest sponsor, eFoodsDirect, is the longest continually operating storable foods company in the country.
[01:33:28.019 --> 01:33:29.481]  They also happen to be true patriots
[01:33:29.901 --> 01:33:30.161]  I think?
[01:33:46.394 --> 01:33:46.915]  Can the U.S.
[01:33:46.955 --> 01:33:49.337]  triumph in drug-addicted war in Afghanistan?
[01:33:49.617 --> 01:33:52.360]  Opium, the CIA, and the Karzai administration.
[01:33:53.101 --> 01:34:02.691]  Other institutions with a direct stake in the international drug traffic include major banks, which make loans to countries like Colombia and Mexico, knowing full well that drugs flow with...
[01:34:03.832 --> 01:34:04.953]  Can you elaborate on that for us, Peter?
[01:34:33.536 --> 01:34:41.299]  Yes, well, I think you said before the break that we might talk about the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, BCCI.
[01:34:41.479 --> 01:34:42.180]  Absolutely.
[01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:54.925]  At the very beginning of the first American involvement in Afghanistan, well, I mean the first military involvement, was in 1980.
[01:34:55.385 --> 01:35:02.508]  All the American equipment that was considerable that was shipped there was shipped through bank accounts of
[01:35:03.137 --> 01:35:04.097]  We're good to go.
[01:35:33.325 --> 01:35:40.811]  I think it was no accident that we chose a drug money laundering bank because once you
[01:35:48.004 --> 01:35:55.668]  You know, there's huge amounts of money involved in drug trafficking and in money laundering.
[01:35:55.908 --> 01:36:09.314]  And let me say this, in my next, in my film, I actually show a news clip of, I believe it's either NBC or CBS with them admitting that William Casey had come clean and said that the US did use BCCI
[01:36:09.654 --> 01:36:11.235]  I have another book coming out next fall.
[01:36:26.809 --> 01:36:28.169]  I'm not quite sure about the title.
[01:36:28.229 --> 01:36:32.151]  It'll either be The Road to Afghanistan or The War Machine.
[01:36:32.571 --> 01:36:42.174]  You can keep up with it just by Googling for me, Peter Dale Scott, and what you'll see right away is my website, and the information will be there.
[01:36:42.274 --> 01:36:55.998]  But I'm going to be pointing out, I have a whole chapter in that book about how there have been a number of banks that serve the purposes both of the CIA and also of organized crime.
[01:36:56.599 --> 01:37:08.790]  Including major mob figures, and the most notorious example of this, which also was closed down after it was exposed, was the Castle Bank Trust in the Bahamas.
[01:37:09.551 --> 01:37:23.343]  And I show that there are connections, or the Nugent Hand Bank in Australia, which was a bank which financed the first major shipments of opium and heroin out of Southeast Asia into Australia back in the 70s.
[01:37:24.572 --> 01:37:32.798]  And I show that there is a kind of continuity underlying all of these banks, and they go back to a very strange figure.
[01:37:33.239 --> 01:37:47.329]  Paul Helliwell, who was a major figure for the CIA and OPC and helped set up the support networks that were operative in Thailand and Burma.
[01:37:47.833 --> 01:37:56.038]  But he also was the counsel for a bank which Meyer Lansky used to launder drug funds coming out of Southeast Asia.
[01:37:56.138 --> 01:38:01.681]  And that underworld CIA connection, I think, merits more attention than it gets.
[01:38:01.701 --> 01:38:04.803]  It's very difficult to learn anything about Paul Helliwell.
[01:38:06.264 --> 01:38:11.647]  But most... Anyway, you have to go to my book to see what it's all about.
[01:38:12.027 --> 01:38:14.549]  But that's a factor in
[01:38:15.702 --> 01:38:18.584]  You know, there are all kinds of people in the CIA.
[01:38:18.644 --> 01:38:27.248]  There's one corner of the CIA, the corner which absorbs the old OPC, where all the drug trafficking business began.
[01:38:28.548 --> 01:38:37.673]  That has been a factor in our politics abroad and, I suggest, also perhaps in our politics at home as well.
[01:38:39.654 --> 01:38:40.295]  Well, I would agree.
[01:38:40.355 --> 01:38:49.484]  I think that this really goes to the very heart of the issue that we go into these nations, they become even larger drug dealers than they were before.
[01:38:49.544 --> 01:38:52.367]  It comes back to U.S.
[01:38:52.407 --> 01:38:59.294]  covert operations and the CIA in cases like Iran-Contra, in cases like MENA-Arkansas, now in cases
[01:38:59.674 --> 01:39:02.156]  Like Afghanistan, right out in the open.
[01:39:02.196 --> 01:39:06.039]  And like you said, they launder this money through these big banks.
[01:39:06.399 --> 01:39:12.945]  But even with the BCCI banking scandal and it going down in the 90s, not many people were prosecuted.
[01:39:12.965 --> 01:39:15.687]  And it just continues under these new banks.
[01:39:15.967 --> 01:39:16.748]  How does that happen?
[01:39:16.788 --> 01:39:22.873]  How does it go from one organization, because obviously BCCI was really set up to
[01:39:23.573 --> 01:39:26.555]  Well, I think the involvement of Citibank and Bank of Boston is a bit different.
[01:39:26.755 --> 01:39:27.555]  They took drug money.
[01:39:27.675 --> 01:39:31.738]  The charge against BCCI was that they were actually involved in making the drug deals.
[01:39:54.597 --> 01:40:13.347]  Making the connections that were set up between the CIA and people in Afghanistan who became drug traffickers, this is very extreme, because before 1979, Afghanistan was not really a player in the international heroin traffic at all.
[01:40:13.767 --> 01:40:19.310]  Hashish, yes, and there still is a market for Afghan hashish, but heroin was
[01:40:21.405 --> 01:40:22.586]  Not produced locally.
[01:40:22.746 --> 01:40:29.909]  Opium was not produced in any great extent, except for local consumption, which was not huge.
[01:40:30.109 --> 01:40:38.434]  And now, of course, it's 93% of the world, so you've got to say that the CIA bears a large share of the responsibility for this.
[01:40:39.194 --> 01:40:43.176]  And we don't get anyone moving to end it.
[01:40:43.636 --> 01:40:47.058]  And this is where I would bring in Citibank and Bank of Boston.
[01:40:47.671 --> 01:40:52.294]  But why should they want to see the drug trade end?
[01:40:52.594 --> 01:41:01.721]  Back in 1982, for example, Mexico was about to default on its debt payments to the banks.
[01:41:02.701 --> 01:41:14.089]  And this would have meant technically, because these were very major loans, that technically Bank of America, the Citibank, would have been technically bankrupt.
[01:41:14.737 --> 01:41:24.224]  And so America, Reagan stepped in and lent our money, your money, my money, tax money, to Mexico to continue its payments.
[01:41:24.304 --> 01:41:41.697]  Before they did that, they had the CIA do an estimate of how much of Mexico's foreign exchange earnings were coming from the drug trade, and the CIA produced this report, which is actually reproduced in a book called Underground Empire, saying that
[01:41:42.335 --> 01:41:50.441]  For Colombia and Mexico, 75% of the foreign exchange earnings are earned from the drug trade.
[01:41:50.581 --> 01:41:58.126]  Well, those are the earnings that Mexico could then use to pay the interest payments on its loans to the Citibank.
[01:41:58.266 --> 01:42:11.615]  So there is no will in the financial superstructure of our country to end this drug trade, which helps us in this extraordinary position of being the world's largest debtor.
[01:42:12.936 --> 01:42:18.860]  And also pretending to be, I don't know, I don't think it may be true for much longer, the world's largest power.
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:28.986]  This is a history of the decline of empires, which we saw in the case of Britain in my lifetime and in the cases of
[01:42:30.499 --> 01:42:37.603]  Well, what we're seeing really is a symbiotic relationship between these banks and global drug trafficking.
[01:42:37.643 --> 01:42:40.585]  It only benefits them on every single level.
[01:42:40.645 --> 01:42:43.607]  Let's take some calls for Peter Dale Scott.
[01:42:43.627 --> 01:42:45.508]  Let's go to Jared in Texas.
[01:42:45.548 --> 01:42:48.550]  Jared, you're on the line.
[01:42:48.590 --> 01:42:48.970]  Yes, hello?
[01:42:49.350 --> 01:42:49.570]  Yes.
[01:42:50.751 --> 01:42:54.633]  Yes, I guess some of the only questions I could ask for him would be
[01:42:56.383 --> 01:43:02.725]  What would your comments be on his thoughts about secret societies and was he part of a secret society himself?
[01:43:03.686 --> 01:43:09.288]  And another question I would have, just to finish it up, would be do you think that it can still be argued that
[01:43:10.290 --> 01:43:20.517]  Some of the main reasons that he was assassinated was because he was going to get us out of Vietnam, he was going to abolish the Federal Reserve, and he wanted to, as he put it, shatter the CIA into a thousand pieces.
[01:43:20.537 --> 01:43:22.158]  And of course you're talking about JFK.
[01:43:22.198 --> 01:43:24.680]  Let's get Peter Dale Scott's take on John F. Kennedy.
[01:43:24.700 --> 01:43:28.183]  Well, there are two questions there to take me, the JFK question first.
[01:43:28.703 --> 01:43:38.250]  I can say with confidence, and I think it's now historians are finally agreeing with me, though it took them a while, that yes, Kennedy did have a plan
[01:43:38.942 --> 01:43:45.245]  That had been approved as a National Security Action Memorandum to withdraw the bulk of U.S.
[01:43:45.305 --> 01:43:59.553]  troops from Vietnam by the end of 1965, starting with 1,000 troops by the end of 1963, and that plan was overruled almost immediately when Kennedy was killed.
[01:43:59.933 --> 01:44:04.096]  That doesn't prove that that's why Kennedy was killed, but it certainly
[01:44:05.900 --> 01:44:13.422]  You had not only this consequence, but it was a suppressed consequence that we didn't know the facts about this until much later.
[01:44:14.422 --> 01:44:23.944]  I know that there's also the charge that he was going to end the Federal Reserve, and that I'm still investigating.
[01:44:24.004 --> 01:44:31.786]  It's worthy of investigation, but I can't because I have to get multiple sources for any claim I make.
[01:44:34.107 --> 01:44:40.130]  I see it on the web a great deal, and I should say that's worthy of investigation.
[01:44:40.350 --> 01:44:43.411]  Now, coming to secret societies.
[01:44:43.511 --> 01:44:50.914]  Yes, all the major universities, particularly the old private ones, have their secret societies.
[01:44:51.735 --> 01:44:58.638]  Like the Porcellian at Harvard, which had Theodore Roosevelt, and Franklin Roosevelt couldn't get in.
[01:44:58.698 --> 01:44:59.538]  They blackballed him.
[01:44:59.978 --> 01:45:01.259]  That's how secret they were.
[01:45:02.207 --> 01:45:12.355]  You have Skull and Bones at Yale, which had both candidates in the 2004 election, George W. Bush and also John Kerry.
[01:45:13.456 --> 01:45:16.258]  I think that's a symptom of a larger phenomenon.
[01:45:16.718 --> 01:45:24.484]  It's not really whether you were in a secret society or not, but the extent to which what I call the overworld runs this country.
[01:45:25.852 --> 01:45:37.858]  And there was actually a Hollywood movie that they put out where they kind of showed the evolution of skull and bones as a recruiting ground for these intelligence agencies.
[01:45:55.373 --> 01:46:00.576]  No, if we want to understand this country, we need to inform ourselves about Skull and Bones too.
[01:46:00.676 --> 01:46:15.366]  But, you know, people are always looking, when I think of all the secret societies that people have pointed to as really running the country, Skull and Bones, or Opus Dei, or the Knights of Malta, there's so many different candidates.
[01:46:15.905 --> 01:46:19.988]  Council on Foreign Relations is not really a secret society, but it's up there.
[01:46:20.008 --> 01:46:24.352]  They're all aspects of the overworld, and they overlap with each other.
[01:46:24.732 --> 01:46:25.172]  Exactly.
[01:46:25.192 --> 01:46:26.433]  All right, let's go to our next caller.
[01:46:26.473 --> 01:46:28.275]  Let's go to Matt in Ohio.
[01:46:28.375 --> 01:46:29.236]  Matt, you're online.
[01:46:30.937 --> 01:46:31.257]  Yes, sir.
[01:46:32.058 --> 01:46:32.378]  Hello.
[01:46:34.119 --> 01:46:44.287]  It seems you talked earlier about the United States foreign policy and how that often supports and mingles with drug growers.
[01:46:46.351 --> 01:46:55.616]  During Vietnam, the CIA interfaced with Kunsan in the Golden Triangle for heroin and opium, obviously.
[01:46:56.957 --> 01:47:02.980]  The Contras in South America for cocaine, and now again Afghanistan for opium.
[01:47:03.661 --> 01:47:12.886]  But there's been a number of allegations that not only is our foreign policy coupled with these traffickers,
[01:47:14.451 --> 01:47:30.364]  But members of our federal government, particularly the CIA, or even the military, actually bring narcotics into the country and sell them here, or basically use them to get funds for the arms trade.
[01:47:32.259 --> 01:47:39.362]  Is your experience and your research, are those allegations credible and where are the best sources?
[01:47:39.402 --> 01:47:41.403]  Let me say this before Peter answers.
[01:47:41.423 --> 01:47:47.026]  I do delve into this in Invisible Empire and a lot of times they'll use proxy nations for plausible deniability.
[01:47:47.386 --> 01:47:50.228]  In other words, during the Iran-Contra affair, what did they do?
[01:47:51.028 --> 01:48:03.113]  Israel buy the arms, they put out the front money, then the United States would take those arms, fly them down to South America, and then they would have their assets fly back, usually not military personnel.
[01:48:03.473 --> 01:48:15.378]  I know that I have a guy named Mike Tolliver and others talking about how they would fly the drugs into places like Homestead Air Force Base, and we know Barry Seal and MENA Arkansas, so they always try to use
[01:48:15.618 --> 01:48:21.121]  Well, I think, again, there's something to investigate here, and I'm not going to give as clear an answer as I'm sure the questioner would like.
[01:48:21.221 --> 01:48:24.963]  During the Vietnam War, we know now that drugs came back to this country in body bags.
[01:48:44.309 --> 01:48:47.090]  Of the cadavers of the victims of the Vietnam War.
[01:48:47.130 --> 01:48:50.852]  I think it's a horrible, gruesome story, but it's true.
[01:48:51.392 --> 01:48:53.093]  It wasn't very high level.
[01:48:53.133 --> 01:49:03.579]  This was an offshoot of the fact that organized crime, the NAFTA, had got into the U.S.
[01:49:03.799 --> 01:49:07.141]  Army in Vietnam and were in a position to set this up.
[01:49:08.141 --> 01:49:12.864]  Drugs came back once into this country on a plane that was flying Henry Kissinger.
[01:49:13.342 --> 01:49:15.403]  But Henry Kissinger didn't know this.
[01:49:15.483 --> 01:49:17.204]  It wasn't Kissinger bringing them in.
[01:49:17.264 --> 01:49:22.327]  It was the people who had corrupted the crew of the plane.
[01:49:22.847 --> 01:49:33.874]  Now, right now, Russia and Pakistan and Afghanistan all have high-level people charging that drugs are coming out of Afghanistan on U.S.
[01:49:34.514 --> 01:49:34.834]  planes.
[01:49:35.955 --> 01:49:37.556]  I don't know if this is true or not.
[01:49:37.696 --> 01:49:39.937]  Every single one of the sources I mentioned
[01:49:41.711 --> 01:49:44.713]  You can't call them impartial or objective.
[01:49:44.793 --> 01:49:47.416]  They're people with a stake in this matter.
[01:49:47.836 --> 01:49:54.281]  But I would think that if this war goes on much longer, we can predict something like this will happen.
[01:49:54.881 --> 01:50:08.472]  I would think it would happen in the same way that happened before, not because the people at the top have said, hey, this is a neat way to get money into the country, but because you set up a large, you have a lot of planes flying in and out.
[01:50:09.122 --> 01:50:11.623]  And you're going to get corruption.
[01:50:11.843 --> 01:50:22.669]  In the case of Colombia, I predicted in 1990, when the first President Bush announced his Andean initiative, there was supposed to be a war on drugs down there.
[01:50:22.729 --> 01:50:27.431]  I said, I'll bet you we'll have more drugs coming into this country as a result.
[01:50:28.050 --> 01:50:29.230]  And boy, was I right!
[01:50:29.310 --> 01:50:43.876]  Within 10 years, the acreage devoted to coca growing in Colombia had trebled as a result of our war on drugs, because you have all the planes going in and out, and people having a chance to make a private fortune off of it.
[01:50:44.036 --> 01:50:45.256]  We'll be back after this.
[01:50:45.296 --> 01:50:47.937]  It's the Alex Jones Show final segment with Peter Dale Scott.
[01:50:58.595 --> 01:50:59.857]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:50:59.897 --> 01:51:05.264]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:05.505 --> 01:51:10.131]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:10.512 --> 01:51:10.912]  It's true.
[01:51:10.992 --> 01:51:15.559]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:16.079 --> 01:51:20.782]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:21.303 --> 01:51:28.228]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:28.428 --> 01:51:29.328]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:29.548 --> 01:51:35.913]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[01:54:04.642 --> 01:54:06.765]  Final segment with Peter Dale Scott.
[01:54:06.785 --> 01:54:10.330]  You can Google his name or you can go to peterdalescott.net.
[01:54:10.370 --> 01:54:15.698]  He is a prolific and well-sourced author, not to mention very insightful.
[01:54:15.758 --> 01:54:18.743]  His latest article alone is about 11 pages long with 20
[01:54:19.944 --> 01:54:21.306]  Eight citations.
[01:54:21.346 --> 01:54:27.372]  Before we go back to Peter, I want to thank the final sponsor of the day, MySolarBackup.com.
[01:54:27.412 --> 01:54:29.054]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[01:54:29.074 --> 01:54:29.274]  877-327-0365.
[01:54:29.514 --> 01:54:35.560]  Have you lost power or wanted to simply flip a switch and get the lights back on?
[01:54:35.580 --> 01:54:39.684]  Well, you can with MySolarBackup.com.
[01:54:39.744 --> 01:54:41.446]  Get this power generator now.
[01:54:42.452 --> 01:54:43.593]  Well, first of all, I think we need to
[01:55:08.928 --> 01:55:10.229]  Get out of the truth.
[01:55:10.530 --> 01:55:16.636]  We're told now that opium in Afghanistan is controlled by the Taliban.
[01:55:17.197 --> 01:55:28.088]  Yes, they have a piece of it, but a much bigger, maybe 5%, maybe 10%, but a much bigger share is people who are behind the Karzai government.
[01:55:30.018 --> 01:55:34.862]  You know, America has done a great deal to create this mess in Afghanistan.
[01:55:35.062 --> 01:55:39.186]  I don't want us just to walk away as we did in 1991.
[01:55:39.266 --> 01:55:41.628]  That left chaos as a result.
[01:55:42.129 --> 01:55:52.297]  I want to end a military incursion that isn't working and replace it with civilian help to the right-minded civilian people there.
[01:55:53.298 --> 01:55:56.541]  This is a different kind of anti-war message
[01:55:57.496 --> 01:56:11.427]  But I think it's one that is necessary, and if we don't, I predict that America can find itself in a much worse war a year or two from now than it is even at the present time.
[01:56:11.587 --> 01:56:14.390]  So I think it's very urgent, and I hope you're still listening.
[01:56:16.776 --> 01:56:21.959]  And Peter, of course, is featured in my latest, my greatest film, Invisible Empire, New World Order to find.
[01:56:21.999 --> 01:56:24.181]  You can pre-order it right now.
[01:56:24.281 --> 01:56:28.123]  He discusses how he went to McGill University with Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[01:56:28.464 --> 01:56:36.729]  He discusses how both Robert Gates and Brzezinski admitted and really bragged that they goaded the Soviets into Afghanistan.
[01:56:36.749 --> 01:56:38.250]  They weren't in there previously.
[01:56:38.290 --> 01:56:39.991]  He discusses the Gulf of Tonkin.
[01:56:40.031 --> 01:56:45.275]  He discusses deep politics and, of course, COG, continuity of government.
[01:56:46.036 --> 01:56:47.997]  Shadow government roles.
[01:56:48.098 --> 01:56:49.799]  It's a very big film.
[01:56:49.899 --> 01:56:51.020]  I'm hoping you get it out there.
[01:56:51.101 --> 01:56:51.921]  You make copies.
[01:56:51.941 --> 01:56:56.706]  You hand it out to your friends and family to awaken them to this system of control.
[01:56:56.766 --> 01:57:03.533]  It's no longer a constitutional republic in which we live, and we really have to work hard to mobilize now.
[01:57:03.933 --> 01:57:05.795]  As Peter says in this documentary,
[01:57:06.115 --> 01:57:11.521]  To find a voice, hopefully through technology, in which we can take this country back.
[01:57:11.561 --> 01:57:13.623]  And I think that's so important.
[01:57:13.924 --> 01:57:17.067]  To not be morally degraded as a society.
[01:57:17.307 --> 01:57:26.277]  To be a society, when we see our troops acting in a manner of randomly killing reporters and civilians, to stand up and say, no, that's enough.
[01:57:26.637 --> 01:57:27.999]  Something has to change, Peter.
[01:57:28.619 --> 01:57:41.811]  Yeah, I'm sorry I didn't say more about continuity of government on this show, because that is a big important aspect that is worth getting into, and that's something else you can Google for, or particularly on my website.
[01:57:43.610 --> 01:57:49.911]  Absolutely, and some of the best insight out there on the continuity of government program is through Peter Dale Scott.
[01:57:49.931 --> 01:57:54.352]  A lot of people still scoff at the idea that a shadow government could even exist.
[01:57:54.392 --> 01:58:01.033]  They think it's something that's only in spy novels and James Bond movies, Peter, but it's very real indeed, isn't it?
[01:58:01.473 --> 01:58:08.234]  Well, we had a group of people planning for the suspension of the Constitution, which was implemented on September the 11th.
[01:58:08.274 --> 01:58:12.175]  Some of those people weren't even in the government, and
[01:58:13.399 --> 01:58:22.826]  The miracle is that because the media has never really talked plainly about this, most people don't know that these plans were implemented on September the 11th.
[01:58:23.446 --> 01:58:23.966]  Absolutely.

[02:00:06.118 --> 02:00:09.899]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Monday edition.
[02:00:10.379 --> 02:00:18.061]  Katherine Austen-Fitz to talk about the economy, the police state, the New World Order, the nature of the elites is coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:20.122 --> 02:00:21.742]  Let's go ahead and take some more calls.
[02:00:21.842 --> 02:00:23.523]  Tony in Canada, you're on the air.
[02:00:25.783 --> 02:00:26.103]  Hello?
[02:00:26.743 --> 02:00:27.183]  Yes, sir.
[02:00:27.764 --> 02:00:28.704]  Hey, how you doing, boss?
[02:00:29.384 --> 02:00:29.684]  All right.
[02:00:30.938 --> 02:00:32.679]  Perfect.
[02:00:32.699 --> 02:00:37.802]  I was doing a lot of research over the past year because of all the information you guys have been providing.
[02:00:37.842 --> 02:00:39.443]  Of course, everybody's thankful for that.
[02:00:39.923 --> 02:00:40.804]  We do appreciate it.
[02:00:41.644 --> 02:00:50.389]  But I haven't been hearing a lot of information about security companies like Converse Technology and Verrent and Nice Systems.
[02:00:51.152 --> 02:00:52.153]  As well as noise.
[02:00:52.453 --> 02:01:03.643]  Well they're a revolving door in homeland security and it's the same in Europe where when somebody's in homeland security they give them the contracts and then five years later they move into that company as an executive.
[02:01:04.446 --> 02:01:29.617]  Absolutely, and one of the biggest issues is that Congress, the headquarters is in Israel, as well as all these other sub-companies or umbrella companies like Verint and Norris and all these other companies, but they have contracts now with American telecom communication companies, and now each and every single telephone across North America is linked to Israeli intelligence through this system, because it's all linked up to Congress.
[02:01:29.637 --> 02:01:30.698]  Boy, that's been for 10 years.
[02:01:31.607 --> 02:01:33.429]  That's been for 10 years, absolutely.
[02:01:33.789 --> 02:01:35.311]  Because then they can get around U.S.
[02:01:35.371 --> 02:01:40.677]  laws because a foreign government is doing the spying and then giving it back to the NSA.
[02:01:41.298 --> 02:01:45.042]  They claim it doesn't get around the law, it just hides the criminality.
[02:01:45.931 --> 02:01:47.111]  No, exactly, exactly.
[02:01:47.392 --> 02:02:06.279]  And if you do your research far enough, it leaks all the way back down to Sourcefire, which their major clients are American Defense Department, the National Security Department, and a lot of these people think if, when they go online and they think that they're safe through these security companies, but one of the major companies that I found that was connected to these things is VeriSign.
[02:02:06.619 --> 02:02:13.982]  Now, VeriSign deals with most of the, majority of the credit card securities online, and everybody trusts this company, but VeriSign,
