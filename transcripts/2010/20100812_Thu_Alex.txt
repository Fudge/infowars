[00:00:04.795 --> 00:00:09.638]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.638 --> 00:00:11.198]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.198 --> 00:00:12.759]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:16.942]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.942 --> 00:00:21.024]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.393 --> 00:00:31.075]  Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this August 12th, 2010 edition.
[00:00:31.075 --> 00:00:36.797]  Alex is away today working on a project so I'll be sitting in for the first hour.
[00:00:36.797 --> 00:00:42.078]  Some of you may know me, I'm Paul Joseph Watson, the writer and editor for PrisonPlanet.com and
[00:00:42.458 --> 00:00:47.403]  We will be going to your calls at the bottom of the hour, so get ready.
[00:00:47.403 --> 00:00:48.143]  And the number is 800-259-9231.
[00:00:48.143 --> 00:00:48.324]  That's 800-259-9231.
[00:00:57.532 --> 00:01:26.872]  But in the meantime, we're going to hit on a number of topics, primarily, of course, the financial meltdown, the double dip recession slash depression, and more importantly, how the collapse of the political dynasty of Barack H. Obama and the buildup of tensions with Iran are all intersecting at the same time, leading to the same ominous conclusion that we'll discuss shortly.
[00:01:27.632 --> 00:01:31.533]  Now, we're going to start obviously with the financial picture.
[00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:33.613]  The Dow Jones is down again today.
[00:01:33.613 --> 00:01:47.557]  It lost no less than 265 points yesterday and the latest job news which came out today is that jobless claims are unexpectedly rising.
[00:01:47.557 --> 00:01:49.397]  This is out the Associated Press.
[00:01:49.397 --> 00:01:52.958]  Jobs picture dims as unemployment claims rise.
[00:01:53.618 --> 00:02:02.200]  The employment picture is looking bleaker as applications for jobless benefits rose last week to the highest level in almost six months.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.981]  It's a sign that hiring is weak and employers are still cutting their staffs.
[00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:18.684]  Now of course this is being billed as a surprise that it was unexpected that jobless claims would rise again and of course that was all coming from the happy clappy you know
[00:02:19.344 --> 00:02:35.492]  Robust recovery crowd who told us that everything was hunky-dory when in fact, as Alex Jones, Gerald Salente, all of us here at PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com have predicted from the very start, this was a sucker's rally.
[00:02:36.212 --> 00:02:41.936]  You know, if you put your money in to the stock market 10 years ago, it was at 10,000.
[00:02:41.936 --> 00:02:44.177]  Now it's a little bit over 10,000.
[00:02:44.177 --> 00:02:48.160]  So if you account for inflation, then you've lost money.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.564]  And once again, this so-called robust recovery has turned out to be nothing of the kind.
[00:02:54.564 --> 00:03:00.588]  GDP figures are being revised downward on an almost daily basis.
[00:03:00.588 --> 00:03:02.570]  The jobs picture is getting worse.
[00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.031]  The housing picture is getting worse.
[00:03:05.031 --> 00:03:05.151]  And
[00:03:06.132 --> 00:03:13.837]  People like Alice Jones and Stellante, again proven right from the very beginning when they said that this was a fake recovery.
[00:03:13.837 --> 00:03:18.240]  And now CNN has followed in the footsteps of the New York Times.
[00:03:19.887 --> 00:03:30.371]  In calling this what it is, I mean it's becoming so brazenly obvious that they're having to state exactly what it is, and it's the onset of another collapse.
[00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:35.793]  CNN article today, is this finally the economic collapse?
[00:03:35.793 --> 00:03:44.737]  And following on from the New York Times' David Krugman, who back in June wrote that the United States was entering, quote, the third Great Depression.
[00:03:45.757 --> 00:03:49.639]  Which would be similar to the Long Depression of the 19th century.
[00:03:49.639 --> 00:04:02.785]  Today, CNN and Keith McCullough warns that the Federal Reserve's announcement yesterday that it will start buying Treasury debt is a crossing the Rubicon moment for the economic decline of America.
[00:04:02.785 --> 00:04:13.970]  And in this article he calls, he says that this action by the Federal Reserve, basically printing more money out of thin air, QE2 as it were, quote, could lead the country to the brink
[00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:15.391]  Of course,
[00:04:35.236 --> 00:04:49.425]  Whether the sodium fluoride heads who get angry about the fact that they can't have Chicken McNuggets for their breakfast will finally start to realise what's going on now that CNN and the New York Times are saying the same things as us remains to be seen.
[00:04:49.425 --> 00:04:53.507]  And we'll explore this further after the break on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:53.507 --> 00:04:54.068]  Stay with us.
[00:04:59.642 --> 00:05:02.784]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[00:05:02.784 --> 00:05:06.566]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[00:05:06.566 --> 00:05:09.447]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[00:05:09.447 --> 00:05:14.390]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.773]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.
[00:05:20.773 --> 00:05:26.436]  It's all fresh, made on a monthly basis, not some old cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[00:05:26.436 --> 00:05:30.979]  Try their new Evacuation Pack, a two-week supply of delicious, easy-to-fix food.
[00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:39.083]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it, with open talk of a strike on Iran in the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.
[00:05:39.463 --> 00:05:41.664]  Get yourself and your family ready today.
[00:05:41.664 --> 00:05:44.045]  The place to go is efoodsdirect.com.

[00:05:59.642 --> 00:06:04.605]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:06:04.605 --> 00:06:05.606]  What have we got?
[00:06:05.606 --> 00:06:08.047]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:06:08.047 --> 00:06:11.710]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.971]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:15.992]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:06:15.992 --> 00:06:17.673]  So they think they own our land?
[00:06:17.673 --> 00:06:18.994]  They think they own our water?
[00:06:18.994 --> 00:06:19.614]  Children?
[00:06:19.614 --> 00:06:20.735]  Our education?
[00:06:20.735 --> 00:06:21.556]  Our money?
[00:06:21.556 --> 00:06:25.198]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:06:25.578 --> 00:06:30.544]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:06:30.544 --> 00:06:31.565]  We have the facts.
[00:06:31.565 --> 00:06:32.726]  We have the Constitution.
[00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:33.628]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:06:33.628 --> 00:06:34.529]  We have common law.
[00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:37.052]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:37.052 --> 00:06:40.816]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:06:40.936 --> 00:06:45.880]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.381]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:06:47.381 --> 00:06:48.462]  Don't tread on me.

[00:08:04.969 --> 00:08:09.813]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:09.813 --> 00:08:11.394]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.394 --> 00:08:12.955]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.955 --> 00:08:17.138]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.138 --> 00:08:21.181]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:24.301 --> 00:08:27.084]  It's the Alex Jones Show on August the 12th, 2010.
[00:08:27.084 --> 00:08:30.909]  Paul Joseph Watson sitting in for Alex for the first hour.
[00:08:30.909 --> 00:08:36.015]  Your call's coming up at the bottom of the hour, so get lined up on the boards.
[00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:38.017]  Now we're talking about the economy.
[00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:40.881]  Jobless claims are the highest since February.
[00:08:40.881 --> 00:08:41.882]  The robust ri-
[00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:49.644]  Recovery is to be exactly as we said it would be all along, which was complete hot air.
[00:08:49.644 --> 00:08:52.486]  The stock market rise was a sucker's rally.
[00:08:52.486 --> 00:09:06.454]  And now that the phony life support system of quantitative easing is being switched off, the very same problems that caused the economic crisis in the first place are coming back with a vengeance.
[00:09:06.454 --> 00:09:07.855]  And so what's the solution?
[00:09:08.755 --> 00:09:10.276]  From the Federal Reserve, of course.
[00:09:10.276 --> 00:09:11.677]  QE2.
[00:09:11.677 --> 00:09:15.119]  More printing money out of fresh air.
[00:09:15.119 --> 00:09:23.324]  Helicopter Ben's simply going to turn the printing presses back on and lend the money back to the US government.
[00:09:23.324 --> 00:09:25.145]  And you, the taxpayer, you're going to pay for it.
[00:09:26.593 --> 00:09:34.496]  The debt increases, the underlying problems remain, but the Federal Reserve continues to make record profits, and that's really what matters, isn't it?
[00:09:34.496 --> 00:09:41.858]  20 billion dollars in interest, and that's your tax money, just last month alone.
[00:09:41.858 --> 00:09:48.680]  The US government in July alone paid 20 billion dollars in interest on the US debt.
[00:09:49.685 --> 00:09:55.668]  And of course that goes straight to the Federal Reserve, only 20% of which they give back to the Treasury.
[00:09:55.668 --> 00:09:58.490]  So, where's the motivation to fix the economy?
[00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:02.052]  The Federal Reserve has hijacked the crisis.
[00:10:02.052 --> 00:10:09.696]  They're making vast profits, record profits, off the money they print, which they then get the interest back from the US government.
[00:10:10.797 --> 00:10:14.158]  And lo and behold, they're now proposing to do more of the same.
[00:10:14.158 --> 00:10:16.218]  We're talking about QE2.
[00:10:16.218 --> 00:10:25.700]  And of course, as the Associated Press reports today, the majority of that bailout money goes straight to foreign banks in France and Germany.
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.381]  It doesn't go to your local bank.
[00:10:27.381 --> 00:10:30.601]  It doesn't even go to massive American banks.
[00:10:30.601 --> 00:10:33.922]  The majority of it goes to offshore banks, which of course,
[00:10:35.111 --> 00:10:49.755]  Is the central bankers looking after each other, slapping each other on the back, as they exploit this economic crisis that they created, to look after each other's interests, as they loot trillions from the taxpayer.
[00:10:49.755 --> 00:10:59.138]  And now with QE2, as the Federal Reserve announced yesterday, we're set for a new fresh round of raping, even as the austerity measures come in.
[00:10:59.918 --> 00:11:08.744]  Even as the income tax goes up, the sales tax goes up, it's going up to 20% VAT here in the UK after January 1st.
[00:11:08.744 --> 00:11:15.609]  That's 20% extra on every purchase you make on most items.
[00:11:15.609 --> 00:11:19.011]  The council tax is going up, the property tax is going up.
[00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:23.935]  We're being forced to pay for this and all the money's going directly to French and German banks!
[00:11:25.433 --> 00:11:37.683]  So now the Federal Reserve says that the initial 700 billion, which of course with the rest of the commitments afterwards amount to over 23 trillion, is not enough.
[00:11:37.683 --> 00:11:42.167]  And we're going to need some more to save America from this economic crisis.
[00:11:42.167 --> 00:11:44.329]  But of course, as CNN admits to
[00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:52.332]  The Federal Reserve's own policies are what is bringing America, quote, to the brink of collapse.
[00:11:52.332 --> 00:11:57.014]  And what will this collapse look like in its aftermath?
[00:11:57.014 --> 00:12:02.216]  I'll just listen to what people like Mark Farber have to say about where all this is heading.
[00:12:02.216 --> 00:12:06.337]  You know, never mind civil unrest and food riots.
[00:12:06.337 --> 00:12:10.158]  Farber is talking about a Mad Max type scenario.
[00:12:10.158 --> 00:12:11.859]  You know, every man for himself.
[00:12:13.075 --> 00:12:28.706]  And, uh, I mean, we can learn from this because within implicit, within the warnings of what we need to do as solutions to protect ourself from what could happen if the very worst comes to pass, which is what Farber is saying.
[00:12:28.706 --> 00:12:31.748]  And this is what he said in an interview just a couple of days ago.
[00:12:33.041 --> 00:12:47.793]  He says, buy a farm you can tend to yourself while out in the boondocks and protect it with high voltage fences, barbed wire, booby traps, military weapons, and Dobermans.
[00:12:47.793 --> 00:12:54.899]  And of course, that's the same rhetoric as another investment advisor, Anthony Fry, told CNBC back in June.
[00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:59.743]  He said people should concern themselves with buying guns, land, and barbed wire.
[00:13:00.535 --> 00:13:03.997]  Now these people are on CNBC and CNN saying this.
[00:13:03.997 --> 00:13:09.319]  This isn't some obscure late-night radio talk show saying this.
[00:13:09.319 --> 00:13:11.820]  So why are they telling us to buy land?
[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:16.123]  Well it's because the US dollar is being devalued out of existence.
[00:13:16.123 --> 00:13:20.965]  Just look at the chart since the beginning of June against the euro and the pound.
[00:13:20.965 --> 00:13:23.586]  The US dollar is going straight down.
[00:13:23.586 --> 00:13:25.167]  It's heading south in a hurry.
[00:13:26.405 --> 00:13:45.199]  And that's because the globalists of course are trying to undermine confidence in the dollar because they want to replace it with a new world reserve currency which is this banker IMF global monetary unit that we've documented and that they've publicly pronounced they aim to bring into existence.
[00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:54.626]  So to do so they need to undermine the US dollar which of course is being done through Bernanke again announcing that the printing presses are going to be turned back on QE2
[00:13:55.956 --> 00:14:02.031]  We're going to have hyperinflation of the US dollar and that spells food inflation.
[00:14:02.031 --> 00:14:04.197]  And of course when food becomes too expensive...
[00:14:05.129 --> 00:14:15.632]  People are going to go hungry unless they have their own self-sufficient sustainable source of food, which is why we encourage people to buy storable food.
[00:14:15.632 --> 00:14:28.596]  But not only that, you need land for growing food, which is why Farber and Anthony Fry and all these top investment analysts are saying, you know, the wisest investment to make in these times is land.
[00:14:30.589 --> 00:14:39.437]  Which of course can be used for both growing food via allotments and vegetable patches as well as keeping livestock.
[00:14:39.437 --> 00:14:52.390]  So if the food riots begin, which London Independent last week reported that food riots could be a consequence of spiralling food inflation, then
[00:14:53.803 --> 00:14:55.704]  You're gonna need to protect this land.
[00:14:55.704 --> 00:15:03.188]  So that's why they're saying not only do you need land, you need barbed wire, you need force, you need guns, you need dogs to protect it.
[00:15:03.188 --> 00:15:15.075]  And I'm aware of how apocalyptic this all sounds, and ten years ago this kind of run-for-the-hills rhetoric, you know, was confined to these obscure late-night talk shows that I've said before.
[00:15:15.075 --> 00:15:17.777]  Well anyhow, the world's leading investment experts
[00:15:18.786 --> 00:15:29.112]  Along with the New York Times and CNN saying the same thing, then, you know, it's time to prick up our ears and start to take notice of what they're saying.
[00:15:29.112 --> 00:15:32.954]  Because food inflation is already skyrocketing.
[00:15:32.954 --> 00:15:42.880]  We have the situation in Russia and Ukraine as well threatening to do the same with these fires blocking exports of wheat.
[00:15:44.261 --> 00:15:51.305]  Which caused, in Russia, food inflation to skyrocket by 19% in just one week!
[00:15:51.305 --> 00:15:54.007]  Because they blocked exports of, uh, wheat.
[00:15:54.007 --> 00:16:00.570]  And remember, Lenin said that, um, you know, grain was the go-to currency.
[00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:03.332]  This is gonna cause food prices to skyrocket.
[00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:20.414]  The London Independent wrote that this, allied with other drastic weather conditions across the world, the floods in Pakistan, similar conditions in Brazil and Colombia, which is stopping them from exporting the cocoa beans and the coffee.
[00:16:22.182 --> 00:16:37.314]  Was leading towards, quote, an inflationary time bomb that threatens to further devastate Western economies, reduce our living standards, while threatening the very lives of those in the third world.
[00:16:37.314 --> 00:16:42.759]  Because in places like Haiti and Pakistan and places like that, people are
[00:16:43.663 --> 00:16:46.644]  The, you know, the veneer of civilization is very thin.
[00:16:46.644 --> 00:16:57.569]  People are very close to death if food so much as rises by 19% as happened in Russia this week.
[00:16:57.569 --> 00:17:00.931]  So the threat of food inflation is obviously something we need to be aware of.
[00:17:02.677 --> 00:17:08.745]  But obviously, most people can't afford to follow the advice of these investment analysts.
[00:17:08.745 --> 00:17:12.130]  Most people can't afford to buy a farm.
[00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:15.795]  They can't afford to buy a bean and rent an allotment to grow vegetables on.
[00:17:17.136 --> 00:17:19.998]  So the solution is, you know, to do it in a group.
[00:17:19.998 --> 00:17:29.586]  Whether that be to invest in land with your family or in a group with your friends and neighbours as a kind of old-fashioned cooperative.
[00:17:29.586 --> 00:17:43.338]  But being independent in terms of food and self-sufficiency is going to be a major advantage in the coming years if the situation gets anywhere near as bad as what these people are predicting.
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:53.052]  And you know, even if everything's hunky-dory, then at least you'll learn some new skills, and you'll become more independent, which is never a bad thing.
[00:17:54.241 --> 00:18:02.646]  So I think it's a good idea to follow the advice of Mark Farber and Anthony Fry and people like this, Gerald Talented.
[00:18:02.646 --> 00:18:15.913]  Because even if things aren't as bad as we're told could happen, and bear in mind that now CNN and New York Times are saying this, then at least you'll become more self-sufficient and you'll learn more skills.
[00:18:15.913 --> 00:18:23.137]  So educate yourself about, you know, growing vegetables, investing in storable food, things like this.
[00:18:24.338 --> 00:18:30.440]  It can only be beneficial even if the crisis doesn't get out of hand, which many are predicting it now will.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:35.041]  You know, even just get a chicken coop and have your own chickens and eggs.
[00:18:35.041 --> 00:18:37.241]  I mean, even that's going to be a help.
[00:18:37.241 --> 00:18:39.062]  And it's going to save you money anyway.
[00:18:39.062 --> 00:18:41.262]  So, you know, where's the downside?
[00:18:41.262 --> 00:18:44.563]  All you need is a little parcel of land.
[00:18:44.563 --> 00:18:46.684]  So I say follow the advice, buy land.
[00:18:47.867 --> 00:19:09.242]  And become self-sufficient, become independent, especially with your food, because that's going to be key in the coming years, if this inflationary holocaust, as many are predicting, occurs as a result of the economic depression, the third depression, as New York Times, as Paul Krugman characterizes it.
[00:19:11.209 --> 00:19:20.835]  So I mentioned at the start of the show that we have these three major issues intersecting and pointing to the same ominous conclusion.
[00:19:20.835 --> 00:19:27.580]  We have the economic meltdown, with it now pretty clear that we're entering this double depression.
[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:34.404]  And even a third, you know, Krugman's has something similar to the long depression of the 19th century.
[00:19:34.404 --> 00:19:36.545]  We have tensions building with Iran.
[00:19:36.545 --> 00:19:40.508]  We have the political dynasty of Bari Satero crashing and burning.
[00:19:41.064 --> 00:19:46.492]  So after the break, we'll talk about how these three issues intersect and lead to the same ominous conclusion.
[00:19:46.492 --> 00:19:47.874]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:47.874 --> 00:19:49.657]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:19:49.657 --> 00:19:50.278]  Stay tuned.
[00:19:50.278 --> 00:19:51.580]  We'll go to your calls shortly.
[00:20:00.526 --> 00:20:03.528]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[00:20:03.528 --> 00:20:05.609]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[00:20:05.609 --> 00:20:08.351]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[00:20:08.351 --> 00:20:10.573]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[00:20:10.573 --> 00:20:11.994]  Okay, here it comes.
[00:20:11.994 --> 00:20:13.895]  But first, the facts.
[00:20:13.895 --> 00:20:15.816]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[00:20:15.816 --> 00:20:17.818]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[00:20:17.818 --> 00:20:21.500]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:29.245]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[00:20:29.245 --> 00:20:29.866]  Sinofresh.

[00:20:49.479 --> 00:20:49.859]  Mention GCN.

[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:50.980]  It works!
[00:21:00.185 --> 00:21:05.148]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:21:05.148 --> 00:21:06.149]  What have we got?
[00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:08.290]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:09.611]  A republic.
[00:21:09.611 --> 00:21:12.252]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:21:12.252 --> 00:21:14.514]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:21:14.514 --> 00:21:16.535]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:21:16.535 --> 00:21:18.236]  So they think they own our land?
[00:21:18.236 --> 00:21:19.557]  They think they own our water?
[00:21:19.557 --> 00:21:20.157]  Children?
[00:21:20.157 --> 00:21:21.278]  Our education?
[00:21:21.278 --> 00:21:22.099]  Our money?
[00:21:22.099 --> 00:21:25.761]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:21:26.121 --> 00:21:31.089]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:21:31.089 --> 00:21:32.111]  We have the facts.
[00:21:32.111 --> 00:21:33.292]  We have the Constitution.
[00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:34.194]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:21:34.194 --> 00:21:35.075]  We have common law.
[00:21:35.075 --> 00:21:37.599]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:37.599 --> 00:21:41.385]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:21:41.465 --> 00:21:46.428]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:21:46.428 --> 00:21:47.929]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:21:47.929 --> 00:21:49.009]  Don't tread on me.
[00:21:49.009 --> 00:21:55.893]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:22:01.013 --> 00:22:04.897]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[00:22:04.897 --> 00:22:06.298]  dollar has been devaluating.
[00:22:06.298 --> 00:22:10.182]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[00:22:10.182 --> 00:22:13.085]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[00:22:13.085 --> 00:22:15.167]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[00:22:15.167 --> 00:22:17.469]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:24.153]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[00:22:24.153 --> 00:22:26.654]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[00:22:34.198 --> 00:22:36.280]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:38.841]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.

[00:22:45.266 --> 00:22:45.926]  That's 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[00:23:00.196 --> 00:23:08.401]  Gulf War vets, 9-11 workers, people around the Gulf oil spill fumes, all were exposed to toxic chemicals in the air and became ill.
[00:23:08.401 --> 00:23:11.062]  Even in your home, air contamination can make you sick.
[00:23:11.062 --> 00:23:18.527]  You have been exposed to airborne toxic particulate matter and volatile organic compounds causing fatigue, flu-like symptoms, or worse.
[00:23:18.527 --> 00:23:19.527]  Protect yourself.
[00:23:19.527 --> 00:23:21.809]  You cannot trust anyone to do it for you.
[00:23:21.809 --> 00:23:25.671]  Clean the air in your home or workplace with a Health Mate Plus air purifier.

[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:13.764]  No one knows what it's like to be the bad man, to be the sad man behind blue eyes.
[00:24:15.538 --> 00:24:21.542]  It's the Alex Jones Show on August 12th, 2010, with me sitting in for Alex Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:24:21.542 --> 00:24:23.923]  Your call's coming up soon.
[00:24:23.923 --> 00:24:35.030]  Now, we were talking about the declining economic picture and how it intersects with the build-up of tensions with Iran, which are now reaching a crescendo, as well as the
[00:24:36.091 --> 00:24:45.018]  Failure of the political dynasty of Barry Sotero as his approval numbers slipped to new lows almost on a weekly basis.
[00:24:45.018 --> 00:24:58.288]  And of course we had the public meltdown of Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesman, telling the Hill newspaper that left-wing critics of Obama are, quote, crazy and ought to be drug tested.
[00:25:00.289 --> 00:25:11.374]  Because they criticised Obama for not fulfilling the very promises he made during the election campaign, specifically with regard to pulling out of Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:25:11.374 --> 00:25:14.255]  The wars under Obama are expanding.
[00:25:14.255 --> 00:25:19.337]  More US troops deployed under Obama than ever were under Bush.
[00:25:19.337 --> 00:25:25.479]  And now even people on the left who voted for Obama are screaming bloody murder.
[00:25:25.479 --> 00:25:27.540]  And finally Gibbs cracked.
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:31.501]  ...and said that they were crazy and ought to be drug tested.
[00:25:31.501 --> 00:25:45.048]  And so this goes to show that the corporate marketing tool of Brand Obama, which hoodwinked millions of Americans in voting for him in 2008, is officially dead and buried.
[00:25:45.948 --> 00:25:47.749]  Now what is Brando Obama?
[00:25:47.749 --> 00:26:00.196]  It's the artificially manufactured marketing strategy that made millions of people vote for a man who represents the precise opposite of what he's billed as and what people voted for him.
[00:26:01.249 --> 00:26:05.093]  On the issues that he promised them during the election campaign.
[00:26:05.093 --> 00:26:12.920]  And nowhere is this better explained than in a clip by John Pilger, who, remember, is a leftist himself.
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:22.450]  And what Pilger talked about, and this occurred shortly after Obama's inauguration, was basically similar to what Alex Jones told you in the Obama deception.
[00:26:24.372 --> 00:26:41.010]  And now we'll listen to John Pilger's description of quote brand Obama and the fact that the public are finally realizing that this is what Obama represents is a major turning point in the death of the political career of Barack Obama.
[00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:44.274]  So we'll play out into the break with this clip from John Pilger.
[00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:54.643]  The clever young man who recently made it to the White House is a very fine hypnotist.
[00:26:54.643 --> 00:27:03.667]  Partly because it is indeed extraordinary to see an African American at the pinnacle of power in the land of slavery.
[00:27:03.667 --> 00:27:13.092]  However, this is the 21st century and race together with gender and even class can be very seductive tools of propaganda.
[00:27:14.178 --> 00:27:22.441]  For what is so often overlooked and what matters, I believe, above all, is the class one serves.
[00:27:22.441 --> 00:27:31.405]  George Bush's inner circle, from the State Department to the Supreme Court, was perhaps the most multiracial in presidential history.
[00:27:31.405 --> 00:27:34.166]  It was PC, par excellence.
[00:27:34.166 --> 00:27:37.687]  Think Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell.
[00:27:37.687 --> 00:27:39.268]  It was also the most reactionary.
[00:27:40.945 --> 00:27:46.970]  Obama's very presence in the White House appears to reaffirm the moral nation.
[00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:49.152]  He's a marketing dream.
[00:27:49.152 --> 00:27:57.719]  But like Calvin Klein or Benetton, he's a brand that promises something special, something exciting, almost risque.
[00:27:57.719 --> 00:28:00.021]  As if he might be radical.
[00:28:00.021 --> 00:28:02.983]  As if he might enact change.
[00:28:02.983 --> 00:28:05.145]  He makes people feel good.
[00:28:05.145 --> 00:28:09.228]  He's a postmodern man with no political baggage.
[00:28:09.228 --> 00:28:10.069]  And all that's fake.
[00:28:11.934 --> 00:28:18.958]  In his book, Dreams From My Father, Obama refers to the job he took after he graduated from Columbia in 1983.
[00:28:18.958 --> 00:28:27.003]  He describes his employer as, and I quote, a consulting house to multinational corporations, unquote.
[00:28:42.708 --> 00:28:56.184]  That's John Pilger talking about Brando Obama and how this corporate marketing strategy was what sold the American people to vote for him in the 2008 election.
[00:28:56.184 --> 00:29:02.331]  But the problem now for the Obama administration and the globalists as a whole is the fact that
[00:29:03.663 --> 00:29:24.276]  With his approval ratings going through the floor, even leftists now, in the aftermath of Robert Gibbs' outburst, are coming to the understanding that they've been completely hoodwinked into voting for somebody who supposedly represented change, but who in fact has proven to be the ultimate servant of the elite.
[00:29:24.276 --> 00:29:29.940]  This is going to cost the Democrats big in 2012, and after the break we'll talk about
[00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:39.366]  How they may try to pull off a desperate last gasp lunge to keep Obama in power and keep their stranglehold over power.
[00:29:39.366 --> 00:29:40.768]  And then we'll go to your calls.
[00:29:40.768 --> 00:29:41.668]  Stay tuned.
[00:29:41.668 --> 00:29:50.515]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:50.515 --> 00:29:51.916]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.916 --> 00:29:54.458]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.458 --> 00:29:57.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.991 --> 00:30:01.631]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:01.631 --> 00:30:05.013]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.

[00:30:59.551 --> 00:31:04.094]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:04.094 --> 00:31:05.014]  Number 1.
[00:31:05.014 --> 00:31:08.437]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:08.437 --> 00:31:09.297]  Number 2.
[00:31:09.297 --> 00:31:14.200]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:14.941]  It's true.
[00:31:14.941 --> 00:31:19.804]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:19.804 --> 00:31:20.644]  Number 3.
[00:31:20.644 --> 00:31:24.227]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:24.227 --> 00:31:27.929]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:28.129 --> 00:31:28.910]  Number 4.
[00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:31.672]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:31.672 --> 00:31:35.356]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:35.356 --> 00:31:36.157]  Number 5.
[00:31:36.157 --> 00:31:40.300]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:45.065]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:45.345 --> 00:31:49.508]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:32:02.356 --> 00:32:06.158]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[00:32:06.158 --> 00:32:09.040]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.

[00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:22.891]  It's the Alex Jones Show, August 12, 2010.
[00:33:22.891 --> 00:33:27.572]  People watching live on PrisonPlanet.tv with the live video stream.
[00:33:27.572 --> 00:33:31.573]  We encourage you to sign up and subscribe today.
[00:33:31.573 --> 00:33:46.777]  Now, we're talking about these three issues that are intersecting at the moment with the double-dip recession slash depression, the build-up of tensions with Iran and the crash and burn of the political dynasty of Barack H. Obama.
[00:33:47.577 --> 00:33:59.704]  Now the big question is, as these three issues accelerate towards each other with the same consequence, the question that will be answered over the next three months is this.
[00:33:59.704 --> 00:34:10.850]  Will the New World Order merely hand the baton on to a neocon in 2012 in the hope that the American people fall for the same left-right scam yet again?
[00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:26.552]  Or, in light of the success of anti-incumbent political candidates, will they make a last gasp desperate lunge to restore the political credibility of Barack Hussein Obama, and how will that manifest itself?
[00:34:27.452 --> 00:34:45.526]  Now if you listen to people like Robert Shapiro who wrote an article for the Financial Times a couple of months ago, he says that the only way to reinstall faith in Obama as a leader is a terror attack on the scale of Oklahoma City or 9-11.
[00:34:45.526 --> 00:34:51.390]  So they've got that option to exploit if they choose to go down that route.
[00:34:51.390 --> 00:34:56.094]  But with the worsening economic picture as it is, and bearing in mind that
[00:34:57.042 --> 00:35:09.671]  The Great Depression of 1929 was only really neutralised with America's entry into the Second World War in 1941, added to the build-up of tensions with Iran.
[00:35:09.671 --> 00:35:16.216]  Will Barack Obama and the globalists who control him turn to the ultimate weapon of control, which is war?
[00:35:17.557 --> 00:35:38.416]  Will the United States support an Israeli attack on Iran as a means of bolstering the economy and providing the perfect opportunity for the globalists to rebuild the world in their image from the ashes of what could potentially become World War III?
[00:35:38.416 --> 00:35:41.519]  These three issues are coming to a head right now.
[00:35:42.557 --> 00:35:49.875]  And I'm sure before the end of the year, we will have a relatively clear and distinct answer to that question.
[00:35:51.104 --> 00:35:57.229]  Will the Democrats pull a political stunt or engineer a crisis to stay in power?
[00:35:57.229 --> 00:36:05.134]  Or will they merely hand the baton on back to the Republican side of the two-party monopoly?
[00:36:05.134 --> 00:36:07.176]  That question remains to be answered.
[00:36:07.176 --> 00:36:19.185]  And will Obama seek to restore his political credibility by launching a war or supporting a war on Iran as a means of rallying the American people around
[00:36:20.885 --> 00:36:23.967]  His White House.
[00:36:23.967 --> 00:36:29.270]  Those questions are going to be vital in the coming months and we'll see how it pans out.
[00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:32.652]  I think we'll get the answer before the end of the year.
[00:36:32.652 --> 00:36:35.714]  So I want to know what you've got to say about this.
[00:36:35.714 --> 00:36:38.055]  And we're going to go to your calls.
[00:36:38.055 --> 00:36:40.977]  And the first caller is Ernie in California.
[00:36:40.977 --> 00:36:41.798]  Ernie, you're on the air.
[00:36:41.798 --> 00:36:42.738]  What's on your mind today?
[00:36:42.738 --> 00:36:44.840]  Not much, Guy.
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:47.701]  I have a couple of things, just real quick.
[00:36:47.701 --> 00:36:50.163]  Yeah, they're going to pull the false flag and let the
[00:36:50.836 --> 00:36:54.759]  Volcano oil well explode and then they'll pull their game.
[00:36:54.759 --> 00:36:58.661]  Some way they're going to try to pull off these elections.
[00:36:58.661 --> 00:37:02.824]  Now the second thing is, I just accidentally got put in jail for a couple days.
[00:37:02.824 --> 00:37:03.825]  For about 16 days.
[00:37:03.825 --> 00:37:05.666]  I want to let you know something.
[00:37:05.666 --> 00:37:13.452]  The biggest corporation, the biggest scam in this United States is our prison and judicial system.
[00:37:13.452 --> 00:37:16.554]  It is amazingly unreal.
[00:37:18.424 --> 00:37:31.052]  Okay, what I see and what I've learned is the first prisoners, and there's a domestic, there's any kind of like martial law, they immediately, the criminal, the real bad prisoners are immediately to be shot.
[00:37:31.052 --> 00:37:33.374]  The rest will be used as slaves.
[00:37:33.374 --> 00:37:41.039]  I see Obama, basically, they're going to pull whatever they can pull to keep his little Barry Futuro butt in there.
[00:37:41.039 --> 00:37:42.940]  And it doesn't matter who else they put in.
[00:37:43.686 --> 00:37:49.603]  Because they all belong to the Trilateral Commission Council on Foreign Relations, and we're never going to see a Ron Paul get elected.
[00:37:52.418 --> 00:38:02.221]  Well, the positive thing we have to hold on to, though, is the fact that all these anti-incumbent candidates are having big successes over establishment candidates.
[00:38:02.221 --> 00:38:06.382]  For example, Sharon Angle in, I think it's Nevada.
[00:38:06.382 --> 00:38:10.283]  She's got a very good chance of kicking out Harry Reid.
[00:38:10.283 --> 00:38:13.123]  And Sharon Angle's this big conservative.
[00:38:13.123 --> 00:38:15.564]  Obviously, she's affiliated with the Tea Party.
[00:38:15.564 --> 00:38:18.025]  But on the issue, she's good because she supports
[00:38:19.145 --> 00:38:19.505]  I don't
[00:38:35.393 --> 00:38:52.584]  Even though some of them are controlled by the Republican arm of the Tea Party, I think that's a very positive development, and it shows us why the Establishment is getting so desperate in trying to demonize these Tea Party candidates, because they do really threaten the status quo.
[00:38:52.584 --> 00:38:56.287]  And that's a big success that we've had in recent months.
[00:38:56.287 --> 00:38:57.147]  Thanks for your call.
[00:38:57.147 --> 00:38:59.809]  Now we're going to go to Julio in Illinois.
[00:38:59.809 --> 00:39:00.929]  Julio, you're on the air.
[00:39:00.929 --> 00:39:02.450]  Go ahead.
[00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:04.352]  Hey Paul, it's great to talk with
[00:39:05.362 --> 00:39:05.843]  I don't think so.
[00:39:23.958 --> 00:39:28.024]  It's 2010, in October, that's the 10th month of the year.
[00:39:28.024 --> 00:39:38.457]  For some reason, I think 10, 10, 10, they may possibly pull something out with trying to save Barrister Toro in terms of a false flag, but my question to you is,
[00:39:39.037 --> 00:39:43.220]  It's about the CIA Mockingbird media.
[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:50.485]  I'm sure you're well informed on Operation Mockingbird, how it got started with Prescott Bush during World War II.
[00:39:50.485 --> 00:40:03.133]  How is the Mockingbird media over across the pond with you in terms of the BBC and Sky News compared to our Mockingbirds here in the States with Murdoch's Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC?
[00:40:05.472 --> 00:40:33.446]  Well the situation with the UK media and how it's controlled by the government is basically you had a situation after the murder of Dr. David Kelly and after 2003 invasion of Iraq where the BBC was completely overtaken by the Labour government and in fact you had a story where Labour Party officials were actually hacked into the computer systems of the BBC, the British Broadcasting Corporation, which is the main
[00:40:34.787 --> 00:40:37.488]  media outlet in Britain.
[00:40:37.488 --> 00:40:40.289]  So it's completely controlled by the government in that sense.
[00:40:40.289 --> 00:40:52.555]  Then on the flip side of the equation, the supposed, you know, alternative to BBC, you have Sky News, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch, who owns Fox News and the Wall Street Journal and so on.
[00:40:52.555 --> 00:40:53.195]  So whatever
[00:40:53.895 --> 00:41:02.958]  Side you go to, whether it be the supposed liberal BBC or the conservative Sky News, it's the same as CNN and Fox News in America.
[00:41:02.958 --> 00:41:09.100]  They're both owned by globalist interests, which is why the Internet's become so much more important.
[00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:21.504]  In recent years and why they're trying to control it and stifles free speech because it's becoming the true outlet, the last outpost of free speech for the individual to use.
[00:41:21.504 --> 00:41:34.089]  And that's why Lieberman is trying to move America towards this Chinese system of internet policing and regulation under his cyber security bill which we're trying to vigorously oppose at the moment.
[00:41:35.228 --> 00:41:36.148]  So thanks for your call.
[00:41:36.148 --> 00:41:38.729]  We're going to go to Jeff in Virginia.
[00:41:38.729 --> 00:41:40.950]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:42.450]  Hello?
[00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:44.251]  Yeah, what's on your mind today, Jeff?
[00:41:44.251 --> 00:41:49.652]  Hi, yeah, just a couple of points I'd like to make and then a couple of questions that I had.
[00:41:49.652 --> 00:41:58.015]  As far as terrorist attacks or something of that nature, I don't think we'll see anything like that probably until next year.
[00:41:58.015 --> 00:42:02.516]  Just thinking that they would probably put that closer to the election than farther away from the election.
[00:42:02.516 --> 00:42:03.256]  Also,
[00:42:07.468 --> 00:42:08.388]  I had another point on that.
[00:42:08.388 --> 00:42:09.769]  I seem to have lost it.
[00:42:09.769 --> 00:42:11.030]  Alright, let me go to my first question.
[00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:12.391]  Maybe I'll come back to that other one.
[00:42:12.391 --> 00:42:14.813]  Oh, no, I remember what it was.
[00:42:14.813 --> 00:42:15.793]  I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:42:15.793 --> 00:42:27.341]  I think that what we'll probably see is the globalist agenda get handed off to some sort of an in-pocket Republican type.
[00:42:27.341 --> 00:42:32.544]  I think Obama's credibility is way far shot, way more shot than
[00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:39.832]  than anything that he can recover from at this point.
[00:42:39.832 --> 00:42:44.093]  One question that I had was kind of regarding the Bohemian Grove.
[00:42:44.093 --> 00:42:46.414]  I know that Alex Jones exposed that.
[00:42:46.414 --> 00:43:04.039]  I don't know if you were involved in that all that much, but my question was, if these globalists are as satanic as they seem to be, and as I've heard people state that they are, is there any indication that that wasn't
[00:43:05.251 --> 00:43:05.672]  I don't know.
[00:43:25.865 --> 00:43:35.713]  I don't know if you guys know anything about that, but I was kind of hoping that maybe the listeners of Alex Jones could get a statement from you guys on that, and I'll take my answers off the line.
[00:43:35.713 --> 00:43:38.736]  Thank you.
[00:43:38.736 --> 00:43:43.880]  Yeah, regarding Bohemian Grove, what the caller talks about is...
[00:43:45.447 --> 00:43:54.949]  Of course, Bohemian Grove is the annual get-together in the Redwood Forest there in California of the world's elite.
[00:43:54.949 --> 00:44:14.452]  And what he's talking about is the fact that during this ceremony, Cremation of Care, which is documented in Alex Jones's Dark Secrets Bohemian Grove movie, they bring in an effigy on a boat with death bringing it in on the boat and they burn it in a mock sacrifice to Molech, which is this
[00:44:14.952 --> 00:44:17.073]  You know, occult pagan owl god.
[00:44:17.073 --> 00:44:18.793]  And this is all on film.
[00:44:18.793 --> 00:44:21.274]  I mean, it's documented up one side and down the other.
[00:44:21.274 --> 00:44:31.098]  And the caller asks, um, is there any evidence that this is a real, um, sacrifice and not something that's done in mock?
[00:44:31.098 --> 00:44:31.618]  Well, of course,
[00:44:32.739 --> 00:44:51.058]  Alex Jones, the ceremony that Alex Jones attended, the sacrifice that they made was obviously a kind of paper mache mock child because it didn't move and the sounds of it screaming when they sacrificed it were, you know, played out over a loudspeaker and voiced by an actor.
[00:44:51.058 --> 00:44:52.399]  But what is interesting is
[00:44:53.260 --> 00:45:17.620]  In the Franklin cover-up, which is a book written by a senator which talks about child abuse and prostitution allegations in regard to people holding high office in the United States, they do talk about taking their victims to Bohemian Grove and doing their sordid practices, their child abuse, paedophilia practices under the owl god Molech.
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:25.585]  Now, of course, again, that sounds completely crazy, but it's in the book, and the Bohemian Grove ceremony is real.
[00:45:25.585 --> 00:45:40.035]  George W. Bush, Henry Kissinger, David Rockefeller do venture out to this ceremony each year, and they do burn a mock sacrifice as kind of an idol worship to the pagan god Molech.
[00:45:40.035 --> 00:45:45.018]  Now, would you let people who do that kind of thing even babysit your children?
[00:45:45.018 --> 00:45:47.560]  Well, no, but these people are custodians of the world.
[00:45:48.243 --> 00:45:51.065]  They're the elite, they're the New World Order.
[00:45:51.065 --> 00:46:05.092]  So, the practices that they, uh, enjoy in private are certainly of massive concern and shock, as Alex Jones's 2000 film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, documented.
[00:46:05.092 --> 00:46:08.694]  So, we're gonna go on to our next caller now, which is Francis in Canada.
[00:46:08.694 --> 00:46:10.735]  Francis, you're on the air, what's on your mind today?
[00:46:12.113 --> 00:46:13.995]  Hi Paul, it's good talking to you.
[00:46:13.995 --> 00:46:23.623]  I wanted to, the whole issue of the Gaza flotilla and the murders that took place has receded into the past now and people are forgetting about it.
[00:46:23.623 --> 00:46:32.371]  But it's been bothering me because there's certain facts about it that haven't come to light in the mainstream press as much as they should have.
[00:46:32.371 --> 00:46:35.314]  I'm going to go to the next call, sorry, your phone's cutting out.
[00:46:36.513 --> 00:46:56.874]  You were talking about the Gaza Flotilla attack, and we covered that at the time, and obviously there was propaganda on both sides with the release of the videos which showed the Israeli paratroops gliding down, and then we had other videos where they were
[00:46:57.575 --> 00:47:00.457]  Shown shooting on innocent civilians.
[00:47:00.457 --> 00:47:02.398]  So it's still up in the air at the moment.
[00:47:02.398 --> 00:47:08.603]  Of course, Israel routinely commits these kind of atrocities and we cover them when they do.
[00:47:08.603 --> 00:47:15.007]  But try calling back in tomorrow because your phone was broken up so we couldn't quite hear what you were saying.
[00:47:15.007 --> 00:47:16.668]  Apologies for that.
[00:47:16.668 --> 00:47:19.710]  But we're gonna go to the next caller which is Sonny in Ohio.
[00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:20.511]  Sonny, you're on the air.
[00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:24.392]  It's the same from the SpermbergTeaParty.com.
[00:47:24.392 --> 00:47:25.653]  Two things I want to bring up to you.
[00:47:25.653 --> 00:47:37.602]  In the front page of the Dayton Daily News today, Wright State University is in bids for trying to do a bone scanning method to replace fingerprinting for the CIA.
[00:47:37.602 --> 00:47:39.223]  I thought that was very interesting.
[00:47:39.223 --> 00:47:40.364]  It's on page one.
[00:47:40.364 --> 00:47:42.165]  You can't miss it, actually.
[00:47:42.165 --> 00:47:44.467]  If you get on there, you see a chick standing in front of a
[00:47:45.692 --> 00:48:03.285]  Skeleton that's supported obviously like in a typical medical lab and it goes in some detail about that I find it to be quite disturbing because obviously biometrics and fingerprints can be altered or disguised but It just kind of goes on this is just like the next level for the naked body scanners or what?
[00:48:03.285 --> 00:48:13.472]  So I find it to be quite disturbing Second point I wanted to bring up to is I want to piggyback on the gentleman earlier from California talking about the jail and judicial system
[00:48:14.062 --> 00:48:17.203]  It is a complete racket.
[00:48:17.203 --> 00:48:19.804]  And I've seen so much stuff.
[00:48:19.804 --> 00:48:21.685]  I mean, it's a joke.
[00:48:21.685 --> 00:48:29.448]  I mean, first of all, they may charge you with multiple charges, then dwindle them down to a couple, and the bottom line is they just want to hurt to get money from you.
[00:48:29.448 --> 00:48:31.089]  And that's one thing.
[00:48:31.089 --> 00:48:38.092]  And two is if you're even remotely politically affiliated, you are bound to be crucified if you go in front of a judge.
[00:48:38.092 --> 00:48:40.833]  So, I mean, it's just completely despicable.
[00:48:40.833 --> 00:48:42.914]  But I'd like to hear your comments about those off the air.
[00:48:44.793 --> 00:48:46.414]  Yeah, I've just found the story.
[00:48:46.414 --> 00:48:51.338]  WSU tries for CIA contract with skeletal identification.
[00:48:51.338 --> 00:48:54.080]  Technology could help identify terrorists.
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:56.942]  So now, apparently the fingerprint's not good enough.
[00:48:56.942 --> 00:49:06.850]  Remember the Total Information Awareness, DARPA, GATE analysis, where they were supposed to identify terrorists by the way they walked?
[00:49:06.850 --> 00:49:08.311]  Well, now they're bringing it to a
[00:49:09.311 --> 00:49:16.078]  internal level and trying to identify terrorists by their skeletal identification.
[00:49:16.078 --> 00:49:30.312]  And it says Wright State University Research Institute is one of a dozen groups chosen from a field of 500 applicants to submit plans to the CIA for cutting-edge technology to identify potential terrorists and other suspects.
[00:49:31.238 --> 00:49:44.267]  University researchers working to develop what they believe is the nation's first bone scanning identification system should know next year whether the CIA will opt to use their biometric identifier.
[00:49:44.267 --> 00:49:58.036]  So now with the onset of body scanners in airports and of course the TSA was caught storing the images as they said they wouldn't, now we're going to a deeper level which is bone scanning.
[00:49:58.656 --> 00:50:00.576]  Identification.
[00:50:00.576 --> 00:50:12.759]  So, Big Brother is not satisfied with your fingerprints, he wants your very skeletal records as part of the database that they're gonna have on American citizens.
[00:50:12.759 --> 00:50:22.161]  Of course, this is all to fight terrorism and to find other suspects, so I'm sure we can trust them with that.
[00:50:22.161 --> 00:50:24.302]  And we're gonna go to Daryl in Tennessee.
[00:50:24.302 --> 00:50:25.522]  Daryl, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:50:27.403 --> 00:50:29.364]  Yeah, Paul.
[00:50:29.364 --> 00:50:32.125]  Just a couple of quick questions.
[00:50:32.125 --> 00:50:48.113]  In terms of the political situation, where you guys have stated over and over again that the voting system is rigged, basically, and they're going to put there who they want to put there.
[00:50:48.113 --> 00:50:52.355]  So what's the real point of going out and voting?
[00:50:53.301 --> 00:50:55.166]  Okay, we'll answer that after the break.
[00:50:55.166 --> 00:50:57.854]  We're going to the break now, but we'll come back and answer that question.
[00:50:57.854 --> 00:50:59.579]  Stay tuned, it's the Alex Jones Show live.
[00:51:01.058 --> 00:51:05.742]  We all know that Berkey Water Purification Systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:03.023]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:03.023 --> 00:52:05.324]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:05.324 --> 00:52:08.526]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:08.526 --> 00:52:13.649]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:13.649 --> 00:52:17.832]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:18.152 --> 00:52:20.495]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:20.495 --> 00:52:23.379]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:23.379 --> 00:52:26.303]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:26.303 --> 00:52:33.913]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:34.235 --> 00:52:39.619]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:39.619 --> 00:52:41.940]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:46.163]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:46.163 --> 00:52:47.223]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:47.223 --> 00:52:48.584]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:48.584 --> 00:52:50.085]  Invisible Empire.

[00:53:03.453 --> 00:53:09.237]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[00:53:09.237 --> 00:53:10.598]  Will they do it?
[00:53:10.598 --> 00:53:13.200]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:19.665]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[00:53:19.665 --> 00:53:21.867]  Think it can't happen here?
[00:53:21.867 --> 00:53:25.350]  Executive Order 10990 locks down all highways.
[00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:31.015]  Executive Order 10995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[00:53:31.015 --> 00:53:35.919]  Executive Order 10998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[00:53:35.919 --> 00:53:40.743]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[00:53:41.664 --> 00:53:50.087]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.

[00:53:55.650 --> 00:53:58.571]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[00:54:10.347 --> 00:54:11.688]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:11.688 --> 00:54:12.449]  Welcome back.
[00:54:12.449 --> 00:54:13.590]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:15.811]  This is the last segment.
[00:54:15.811 --> 00:54:17.272]  And we're going to your calls.
[00:54:17.272 --> 00:54:21.235]  The caller, previous caller before the break was asking about electronic voting machines.
[00:54:21.235 --> 00:54:24.718]  You know, what's the point in voting if it's all rigged anyway?
[00:54:24.718 --> 00:54:27.640]  Well, the good news is a lot of these machines are being kicked out.
[00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:28.881]  For example, in Ohio,
[00:54:30.242 --> 00:54:51.948]  The state authorities have got rid of some of the machines and now Diebold is trying to sue them for breach of contract and that's caused the local authorities to sue Diebold back for irregularities in these voting machines so I think they're starting to turn the tide on that and many states are starting to go back to paper ballots but obviously
[00:54:53.229 --> 00:54:57.132]  It's a long battle, but we're seeing some progress in that.
[00:54:57.132 --> 00:55:01.256]  But we're short on time, so we're going to go to George in Connecticut.
[00:55:01.256 --> 00:55:02.116]  George, you're on the air.
[00:55:02.116 --> 00:55:03.057]  What's in your mind today?
[00:55:03.057 --> 00:55:04.799]  Hi, Watson.
[00:55:04.799 --> 00:55:08.882]  I think we're gaining ground, unfortunately, not consistently.
[00:55:08.882 --> 00:55:11.945]  I was listening to a different show called Gary Knoll.
[00:55:11.945 --> 00:55:17.650]  I don't know if you know of him, but they are literally going after this guy, and he had a person
[00:55:18.391 --> 00:55:34.001]  One of the organizations that basically was investigating, they were trying to target him, but he investigated and found out he was such a good guy that he was tipping him off that they were targeting him with black ops groups and also trying to find somebody to blackmail.
[00:55:34.001 --> 00:55:38.303]  And the thing is, he's been going around to all these groups for inoculation.
[00:55:38.303 --> 00:55:43.927]  He has scientific knowledge and he has the papers, and every time they bring up a point
[00:55:44.451 --> 00:56:00.359]  He literally brought up a hundred pages worth of documentation to prove that Muley's inoculations had no basis in scientific fact, and there was no reason or reason to inoculate anybody, and they didn't even have a legal right to push these things forward, so they've been targeting him.
[00:56:00.359 --> 00:56:13.845]  But another thing, he's been a big man on GMO foods, and there's been groups that have been popping up because of his work, and they've had some successes where people were starting to boycott
[00:56:14.448 --> 00:56:14.668]  We're
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:45.324]  I don't know, not just Alex Jones, but this type of thing of the world type of government trying to take over and the bankers and things like that.
[00:56:45.324 --> 00:56:50.507]  How is the Europeans in general, not just England, starting to awaken or not awaken?
[00:56:50.507 --> 00:56:51.307]  What's going on there?
[00:56:53.407 --> 00:57:09.240]  Well, the world government in Europe is being pushed by means of this tax that will go to bankroll the world government, similar to how the United Nations is proposing the carbon tax, which will go, as we learned, directly to the World Bank.
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:20.609]  Now the European Union is proposing that, for example, British citizens pay a tax that will go directly to bankroll the EU and the expansion of that federalist superstate.
[00:57:21.770 --> 00:57:50.841]  The primary offensive is on the tax front and getting us to pay for our own enslavement but people are wise to it and people are already being taxed to death with these austerity measures so it's very doubtful that they're going to go ahead and go along with it especially as opposition to the EU in the UK routinely runs about 70% oppose anything proposed by the EU so there's very strong resistance against the EU.
[00:57:52.081 --> 00:57:56.262]  Uh, in the UK, sorry, against the EU, and there always has been.
[00:57:56.262 --> 00:57:59.603]  Last caller is Lex in Ohio.
[00:57:59.603 --> 00:58:00.963]  Lex, you're on the air.
[00:58:00.963 --> 00:58:03.184]  Go ahead.
[00:58:03.184 --> 00:58:05.044]  Thanks for, uh, taking my call.
[00:58:05.044 --> 00:58:10.966]  I just wanted to ask, I'm gonna follow suit from some other callers, uh, and get the European perspective.
[00:58:10.966 --> 00:58:21.008]  Since Russia and China, China's mentioned, but they're basically ignored, how do you think they're going to react to an invasion of Iran, either unsuccessful or successful?
[00:58:23.723 --> 00:58:26.224]  America is ultimately headed for a conflict with China.
[00:58:26.224 --> 00:58:30.867]  It could come from Iran, it could come from North Korea, but that's the ultimate goal for the globalists.
[00:58:30.867 --> 00:58:32.608]  We're out of time.
[00:58:32.608 --> 00:58:35.050]  Top interviews coming up with Max Keiser, Ray McGovern.
[00:58:35.050 --> 00:58:37.071]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:37.071 --> 00:58:41.814]  Stay tuned, we'll be back tomorrow.
[00:58:41.814 --> 00:58:42.875]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:42.875 --> 00:58:45.997]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:51.562 --> 00:58:54.124]  And you're subject to public police action.
[00:58:54.124 --> 00:58:55.385]  Tyranny is here.
[00:58:55.385 --> 00:58:59.187]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:58:59.187 --> 00:59:01.549]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:59:01.549 --> 00:59:06.973]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:59:07.413 --> 00:59:14.081]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:59:14.081 --> 00:59:20.088]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:59:20.088 --> 00:59:23.733]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:59:24.233 --> 00:59:28.516]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:59:28.516 --> 00:59:34.480]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:38.043]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:59:38.043 --> 00:59:40.004]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:59:40.004 --> 00:59:41.145]  It's here.

[00:59:53.092 --> 00:59:55.494]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.494 --> 01:00:04.981]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:04.981 --> 01:00:06.302]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.302 --> 01:00:08.063]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.063 --> 01:00:09.825]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.825 --> 01:00:11.406]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.406 --> 01:00:12.967]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.967 --> 01:00:17.150]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:21.214]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.204 --> 01:00:28.448]  We are now into our number three, Ray McGovern.
[01:00:28.448 --> 01:00:35.498]  He was one of the chief morning briefers and analysts, of course, in George Herbert Walker Bush's administration.
[01:00:35.498 --> 01:00:39.343]  Also a Army veteran, is our guest.
[01:00:39.343 --> 01:00:40.204]  I wanted to get him on.
[01:00:40.905 --> 01:00:41.265]  to talk
[01:01:01.561 --> 01:01:07.226]  More and more it looks like they're green lighting an attack sometime as an October surprise.
[01:01:07.226 --> 01:01:09.448]  We'll talk to Ray McGovern about that as well.
[01:01:09.448 --> 01:01:10.609]  Ray, it's always great to have you.
[01:01:10.609 --> 01:01:11.270]  Thanks for coming on.
[01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:12.911]  You're most welcome.
[01:01:12.911 --> 01:01:14.413]  WikiLeaks, give us your breakdown on it.
[01:01:15.615 --> 01:01:20.196]  Well, there are a lot of interesting things about it, substantively.
[01:01:20.196 --> 01:01:35.459]  It shows that the war is clearly a misbegotten effort, largely because Pakistan, their security services, the ISI, are supporting the Taliban, funding them, training them, leading them in battle.
[01:01:35.459 --> 01:01:36.820]  It's quite remarkable.
[01:01:39.298 --> 01:01:46.761]  Army documents, you know, these are official documents recognized as authentic by the administration now.
[01:01:46.761 --> 01:02:02.868]  They paint a picture of the Inter-Service Intelligence Unit there in Pakistan taking the billion of dollars that we give them every year and turning it around and making sure that the insurgency
[01:02:04.688 --> 01:02:05.628]  Prosperous, really.
[01:02:05.628 --> 01:02:16.231]  And so, you know, this whole business about the, you know, the border areas and we need to get the Pakistanis to realize that they need to throw their lot in with us.
[01:02:16.231 --> 01:02:26.614]  Well, what really strikes me as bizarre is that you get people like our Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, goes down to Islamabad and says,
[01:02:28.038 --> 01:02:32.803]  But to the Pakistani leader, she said, you really shouldn't be afraid of India.
[01:02:32.803 --> 01:02:33.984]  I just came from India.
[01:02:33.984 --> 01:02:35.666]  They're very nice people there.
[01:02:35.666 --> 01:02:38.849]  And they told me they wish you no harm.
[01:02:38.849 --> 01:02:41.371]  And so don't be worried about India.
[01:02:41.371 --> 01:02:43.373]  Be worried about terrorists.
[01:02:43.373 --> 01:02:46.256]  Be worried about Taliban and al-Qaeda.
[01:02:46.256 --> 01:02:47.638]  That's what you should worry about.
[01:02:49.068 --> 01:02:59.834]  Alex, anybody who knows anything about the history of the subcontinent knows that you're not going to be able to persuade the Pakistanis to worry about anybody else but India and vice versa.
[01:02:59.834 --> 01:03:02.275]  And so how does this impact on Afghanistan?
[01:03:02.275 --> 01:03:11.680]  Well, the way that the Pakistanis ensure, or try to ensure, that India no longer has a preeminent influence in
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:15.682]  Kabul and the rest of Afghanistan is to have their own assets.
[01:03:15.682 --> 01:03:19.765]  And those assets are ones that they recreated on our behalf many years ago.
[01:03:19.765 --> 01:03:21.406]  They called it Taliban.
[01:03:21.406 --> 01:03:23.467]  And they're going to play that card forever.
[01:03:23.467 --> 01:03:37.496]  And it's just a matter of time before the feckless counterinsurgency tactics realize that there's an external supply of people and weapons and everything else, just as there was in Vietnam, by the way.
[01:03:38.214 --> 01:03:45.036]  You know, when the North kept supplying the troops in the South, we were going to interdict the supply, right?
[01:03:45.036 --> 01:03:46.956]  And we couldn't do that, then what do we do?
[01:03:46.956 --> 01:03:48.597]  We bomb the North.
[01:03:48.597 --> 01:03:50.538]  So, what do we do in Pakistan?
[01:03:50.538 --> 01:03:56.879]  We're bombing Pakistan, this time with fancy, fancy drone stuff where nobody gets shot down or gets killed.
[01:03:56.879 --> 01:03:58.080]  Give me a break!
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:04.581]  It's the most reckless exercise that I've ever seen, and these documents prove it beyond reasonable belief.
[01:04:04.581 --> 01:04:05.882]  Now, beyond
[01:04:07.183 --> 01:04:08.789]  Beyond reasonable doubt, let's say.
[01:04:08.789 --> 01:04:11.440]  Now, the White House...
[01:04:12.082 --> 01:04:32.309]  Three days ago, dictated to the stenographers, they call themselves the White House Press Corps, and they all took the dictation, namely, nothing new here, you know, we do all that stuff, we took that into account when we made our big decision late last year, and all this stuff, and so that goes up in the headlines in the Washington Post and the other papers.
[01:04:32.309 --> 01:04:33.209]  It's ridiculous.
[01:04:33.209 --> 01:04:37.911]  They should read the documents, but they're being discouraged to do that.
[01:04:38.539 --> 01:04:39.600]  You know what it reminds me of?
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:46.846]  It reminds me of back in 2005 when the Downing Street Memo was released.
[01:04:46.846 --> 01:04:49.708]  Does that sound like we have to break here?
[01:04:49.708 --> 01:04:51.369]  If we do... Yes sir, stay there.
[01:04:51.369 --> 01:04:52.530]  We're going to come right back.
[01:04:52.530 --> 01:05:00.056]  I just didn't want to interrupt you to continue with your view of WikiLeaks, how the media is trying to spin it, what you think these documents are really going to...
[01:05:02.008 --> 01:05:05.969]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:05.969 --> 01:05:14.831]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.

[01:06:56.992 --> 01:06:58.713]  This information is too important to wait.
[01:06:59.622 --> 01:07:04.165]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:04.165 --> 01:07:05.065]  Number 1.
[01:07:05.065 --> 01:07:08.508]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:08.508 --> 01:07:09.368]  Number 2.
[01:07:09.368 --> 01:07:14.251]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:14.251 --> 01:07:14.992]  It's true.
[01:07:14.992 --> 01:07:19.875]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:19.875 --> 01:07:20.695]  Number 3.
[01:07:20.695 --> 01:07:24.278]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:24.278 --> 01:07:27.980]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:28.981]  Number 4.
[01:07:28.981 --> 01:07:31.743]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:31.743 --> 01:07:35.427]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:35.427 --> 01:07:36.208]  Number 5.
[01:07:36.208 --> 01:07:40.351]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:40.351 --> 01:07:45.116]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:45.396 --> 01:07:49.578]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:49.578 --> 01:07:51.359]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:51.359 --> 01:07:53.620]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:56.121]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:07:56.121 --> 01:08:04.004]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[01:08:15.146 --> 01:08:21.513]  Rallying patriots worldwide.
[01:08:21.513 --> 01:08:28.180]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:33.145]  Alright, former CIA analyst and mourning briefer to George Herbert Walker Bush and others.
[01:08:34.979 --> 01:08:40.024]  A guy who's really made a lot of accurate predictions and breakdowns here on this show joins us.
[01:08:40.024 --> 01:08:44.868]  We were talking about WikiLeaks and what that means to the Afghan war.
[01:08:44.868 --> 01:08:49.211]  The last year I've seen all these denials that, oh, there's not advisors.
[01:08:49.211 --> 01:08:51.773]  There's not army and CIA advisors in Pakistan.
[01:08:51.773 --> 01:08:55.477]  You know, that's a lie that there's no Blackwater there.
[01:08:55.477 --> 01:08:56.998]  Now these documents confirm that.
[01:08:56.998 --> 01:08:58.039]  But just in the last week,
[01:08:59.076 --> 01:08:59.356]  I don't know.
[01:09:14.215 --> 01:09:17.658]  But I don't think that's the fault of WikiLeaks, so much of the media just spinning it.
[01:09:17.658 --> 01:09:19.940]  But I know Ray McGovern can comment on that.
[01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:23.824]  And are there big connections from Pakistani intelligence to the Taliban and why?
[01:09:23.824 --> 01:09:29.229]  And then I want to get into Iran and the war drums really getting more and more intense on that front.
[01:09:29.229 --> 01:09:32.091]  But you were cut off by the break, Ray.
[01:09:32.091 --> 01:09:32.652]  Please continue.
[01:09:33.547 --> 01:09:50.135]  Sure, I was just trying to raise a comparison here between the WikiLeaks treatment by the fawning corporate media and the way the same fawning corporate media treated the revelations in the after Downing Street minutes.
[01:09:51.211 --> 01:10:11.886]  You'll recall that those were minutes recording the chief British spy telling Tony Blair that George Bush had decided to go to war with Iraq for regime change, that this war would be, quote, justified, end quote, by the conjunction of weapons of mass destruction
[01:10:12.586 --> 01:10:22.472]  And terrorism, translation from the British, will say that he has all kinds of weapons of mass destruction and that he's going to use them, give them to terrorists.
[01:10:22.472 --> 01:10:32.279]  And finally, that crowning sentence for us intelligence specialists, it went this way, quote, but the intelligence and facts are being fixed around the policy, period, end quote.
[01:10:32.819 --> 01:10:43.329]  So that was manifest information, documentary information, the minutes of the meeting written by a participant the same day, and it showed that the intelligence was being fixed.
[01:10:43.329 --> 01:10:49.034]  And that was July, the middle of July 2002, some eight or nine months before the war.
[01:10:49.674 --> 01:11:01.039]  Now, in this case, well, in that case, the New York Times avoided even mentioning it until Representative Conyers held that hearing at which I testified.
[01:11:01.039 --> 01:11:05.601]  And two mornings before the hearing, he and I were both on Amy Goodman.
[01:11:05.601 --> 01:11:13.765]  And that very morning, The Washington Post published editorial saying, oh, yes, and there are these after Downing Street minutes.
[01:11:14.825 --> 01:11:17.147]  They are of no consequence.
[01:11:17.147 --> 01:11:18.448]  We knew that all the time.
[01:11:18.448 --> 01:11:29.394]  I had a laugh because my thought was, you know, if the Washington Post knew that the intelligence was being fixed all the time, I don't know exactly why they didn't tell us.
[01:11:29.394 --> 01:11:34.437]  Can you hazard a guess on that, Alex?
[01:11:34.437 --> 01:11:36.598]  So the situation here is the same.
[01:11:36.598 --> 01:11:37.919]  They don't want anybody to read them.
[01:11:37.919 --> 01:11:40.040]  They don't want anybody to analyze them.
[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:41.401]  And even the New York Times.
[01:11:42.482 --> 01:11:58.682]  Which was forced to publish this because they knew that the Guardian in London and Der Spiegel in Hamburg, that they both had them and they would be scooped and it would be very embarrassing for people to realize that the New York Times had these documents and hadn't published them.
[01:11:59.222 --> 01:11:59.963]  So what did they do?
[01:11:59.963 --> 01:12:03.327]  They went to the White House and said, you know, we're in this bind.
[01:12:03.327 --> 01:12:06.170]  We don't want to be scooped, and is it okay if we can?
[01:12:06.170 --> 01:12:10.114]  And the White House was very understanding.
[01:12:10.114 --> 01:12:12.697]  Oh, shucks, I guess this time you can.
[01:12:12.697 --> 01:12:19.925]  And Robert Gibbs, the president's spokesman, later complimented the responsible way that the New York Times conducted themselves.
[01:12:20.425 --> 01:12:35.514]  I'll tell you, Alex, if the press has to go to the White House to receive permission to publish things, and that's the responsible way to act, we've come one heck of a long way in the free press of this country.
[01:12:35.514 --> 01:12:48.042]  Do you think this is going to have as much of an effect on the Afghan-slash-Pakistan conflict as the Pentagon Papers with Daniel Ellsberg and the Rand Corporation did to the Vietnam War?
[01:12:49.309 --> 01:13:00.280]  Alex, I've often said that the biggest sea change that I witnessed in this town of Washington in the 47 years I've been here is that there's no longer in any real sense a free press.
[01:13:01.201 --> 01:13:03.484]  There was back in the 70s.
[01:13:03.484 --> 01:13:05.186]  There was in the 60s.
[01:13:05.186 --> 01:13:08.110]  We got rid of a president because of a free press.
[01:13:08.110 --> 01:13:09.451]  There is none now.
[01:13:09.451 --> 01:13:18.002]  And so it all depends on whether the defunct fourth estate has been replaced by a vibrant fifth estate.
[01:13:18.002 --> 01:13:19.243]  And that's the good news, folks.
[01:13:19.904 --> 01:13:23.190]  There's a fifth estate out there, a free media.
[01:13:23.190 --> 01:13:26.155]  The medium is the ether.
[01:13:26.155 --> 01:13:32.466]  It's not susceptible of control by governments or advertisers or corporations which don't own it.
[01:13:33.506 --> 01:13:44.411]  And we have the WikiLeaks phenomenon and many other phenomena that feed on the availability of this wonderful resource.
[01:13:44.411 --> 01:13:55.796]  And so even though the Fourth Estate is dead, and we should duly mourn it because it's a travesty to have those folks stenographing in a whiteout, the Fifth Estate is vibrant.
[01:13:55.796 --> 01:13:57.837]  And so I think that if people
[01:13:58.844 --> 01:14:13.733]  Are given enough information, you know, it's impossible for everybody to read all these army documents, but if if there's a if people know where to look for real information on this and that's the missing link.
[01:14:15.111 --> 01:14:40.789]  In speaking around town here, I've been referring often to the WikiLeaks exposure of that turkey shoot, that god-awful turkey shoot that our soldiers there in that Apache helicopter gunship, the gun barrel photography, the video on that, with sound, showing our young people just floating over the turkey shoot of about a dozen Iraqi civilians minding their own business.
[01:14:41.229 --> 01:14:41.650]  I think so.
[01:15:02.669 --> 01:15:03.349]  Murder.
[01:15:03.349 --> 01:15:04.470]  That's all you need.
[01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:05.630]  Collateral murder.
[01:15:20.697 --> 01:15:27.899]  We read about Top Secret USA, 854,000 private individuals with the highest security level.
[01:15:27.899 --> 01:15:30.640]  We know they're training the military for domestic operations.
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:33.401]  The White House admits they want to start censoring the internet.
[01:15:33.401 --> 01:15:35.021]  Cass Sunstein does.
[01:15:35.021 --> 01:15:43.404]  And it looks like the system realizes it's not going to get away with all this corruption if they don't start curtailing the web.
[01:15:43.404 --> 01:15:44.384]  Are you concerned about that?
[01:15:45.222 --> 01:16:11.253]  I am, and specifically because the general, now four-star General Keith Alexander, is the same fellow who lied to Congressman Rush Holt, who's on the House Intelligence Committee and went out there to NSA in December of 2007 and asked Alexander, you're not eavesdropping on American citizens, are you?
[01:16:13.018 --> 01:16:16.699]  Oh no, that's against our first commandment!
[01:16:16.699 --> 01:16:20.381]  And James Risen's article came out just a week later.
[01:16:20.381 --> 01:16:24.924]  So Alexander, you know in my day we used to think that army officers shouldn't lie.
[01:16:24.924 --> 01:16:28.165]  Well, he lied to his congressional overseer.
[01:16:28.165 --> 01:16:29.866]  That's a crime, okay?
[01:16:29.866 --> 01:16:37.070]  And now he is in charge of all this cyberspace stuff, security, offensive stuff, and still head of
[01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:45.832]  And now the Washington Post says Obama wants to search everybody's computers and ISPs without warrants now, something they're already doing.
[01:16:45.832 --> 01:16:51.773]  So we've gone from Bush lying three years ago and saying, we're not spying on you without warrants, that's illegal.
[01:16:51.773 --> 01:16:56.653]  And to this general doing it, to him now being the head of it and saying, yeah, we're listening to everything you're doing.
[01:16:56.653 --> 01:17:02.694]  And Google is in Wired Magazine today saying, we're with the CIA watching all of you in real time.
[01:17:02.694 --> 01:17:05.535]  So they've gone from saying, oh, we would never do that to, yeah.
[01:17:06.075 --> 01:17:07.537]  Yeah, we're watching everything.
[01:17:07.537 --> 01:17:10.680]  You know what the saving grace is here, Alex?
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:20.912]  The saving grace is that by adding more straw or more hay to the haystack, it makes it even more difficult to find the needles.
[01:17:20.912 --> 01:17:23.395]  Now, maybe you and I are getting special treatment.
[01:17:23.935 --> 01:17:35.028]  But if you deluge, if you deluge the system with more and more intercepted coverage, just think of the billions and billions of things that they collect every day in NSA.
[01:17:35.028 --> 01:17:38.452]  It's funny in terms of them running down patriots like us.
[01:17:38.452 --> 01:17:44.138]  It's not so funny when there are real terrorists out there and they can't find this natal in the haystack.
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:57.230]  Or corporate criminals, and we've seen that under Bush Sr., Clinton, right through to Obama, where they've cut almost all of the government corporate fraud investigators.
[01:17:57.230 --> 01:18:01.093]  You know, 11 years ago they knew what Madoff was doing, but blocked it.
[01:18:01.093 --> 01:18:06.738]  Now the Federal Trade Commission has been given total anonymity and immunity for covering up crimes.
[01:18:06.738 --> 01:18:09.520]  I mean, this is wild.
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:12.943]  Yeah, Alex, those folks all look like us though, you know?
[01:18:13.695 --> 01:18:14.036]  I don't know.
[01:18:32.666 --> 01:18:42.052]  Unless, just like torture doesn't work, unless you want fake confessions and to scare people, unless they know none of this really works, they can just claim their intel shows it.
[01:19:02.349 --> 01:19:11.372]  Yeah, in part, it's what I consider to be the biggest corporate welfare program in our country since the Strategic Defense Initiative.
[01:19:11.372 --> 01:19:13.372]  You know, the anti-ballistic missile thing.
[01:19:13.372 --> 01:19:14.133]  Star Wars.
[01:19:14.133 --> 01:19:15.153]  Star Wars, yeah.
[01:19:15.153 --> 01:19:18.574]  What you got here is two and a half times as big.
[01:19:22.393 --> 01:19:22.874]  I think so.
[01:19:32.253 --> 01:19:42.183]  And what we could do in this country with $75 billion, I hate to tell you how many schools we could build, how many teachers we could train and retain, and all the other uses.
[01:19:42.183 --> 01:19:43.545]  How many bridges we could fix?
[01:19:43.545 --> 01:19:46.608]  We got a short five-minute segment coming up and then Ray's got to go.
[01:19:46.608 --> 01:19:49.671]  Let's get into Iran and the green lighting for that attack.
[01:19:49.671 --> 01:19:50.312]  Is it on?
[01:19:50.312 --> 01:19:52.194]  We're going to talk to him straight ahead.
[01:19:52.194 --> 01:19:53.695]  This is vital info.
[01:19:53.695 --> 01:19:54.196]  Stay with us.
[01:20:00.678 --> 01:20:10.183]  Nine years, thousands of clients worldwide, amazing results, and here's more proof of the effectiveness of how Heart and Body Extract supports good circulation and healthy arterial flow.
[01:20:10.183 --> 01:20:11.504]  My name is Crystal.
[01:20:11.504 --> 01:20:14.445]  I'm a 45-year-old and live in Houston, Texas.
[01:20:14.445 --> 01:20:18.407]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[01:20:18.407 --> 01:20:22.369]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[01:20:22.529 --> 01:20:23.370]  What did Crystal do?
[01:20:23.370 --> 01:20:27.335]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.
[01:20:27.335 --> 01:20:33.742]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.
[01:20:33.742 --> 01:20:37.306]  Clean, clear arteries are happy arteries after using Heart and Body Extract.

[01:21:01.055 --> 01:21:02.076]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:21:02.076 --> 01:21:07.618]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[01:21:07.618 --> 01:21:08.159]  I get it.
[01:21:08.159 --> 01:21:17.783]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:21:17.783 --> 01:21:18.944]  That's not what's happening.
[01:21:19.184 --> 01:21:27.648]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[01:21:27.648 --> 01:21:31.050]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:21:31.050 --> 01:21:35.312]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:21:35.312 --> 01:21:36.912]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:21:36.912 --> 01:21:40.334]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[01:21:40.334 --> 01:21:44.476]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:21:44.696 --> 01:21:45.596]  You should too.
[01:21:45.596 --> 01:21:46.737]  Find out what they know.
[01:21:46.737 --> 01:21:50.038]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[01:21:50.038 --> 01:21:50.098]  800-686-2237.
[01:21:50.098 --> 01:21:50.458]  800-686-2237.
[01:21:50.458 --> 01:21:50.639]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:00.484 --> 01:22:02.866]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:22:02.866 --> 01:22:05.088]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:22:05.088 --> 01:22:08.390]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:13.495]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:22:13.495 --> 01:22:17.698]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:22:17.998 --> 01:22:20.462]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:22:20.462 --> 01:22:23.246]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:22:23.246 --> 01:22:26.170]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:22:26.170 --> 01:22:33.782]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:22:34.099 --> 01:22:39.483]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:22:39.483 --> 01:22:41.804]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:22:41.804 --> 01:22:46.027]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:22:46.027 --> 01:22:47.087]  And I got news for you.
[01:22:47.087 --> 01:22:48.448]  You're everyone else.
[01:22:48.448 --> 01:22:49.929]  Invisible Empire.

[01:24:02.472 --> 01:24:05.134]  Okay, let's move quick with Ray McGovern.
[01:24:05.134 --> 01:24:08.197]  Looks like they're lining up an attack on Iran.
[01:24:08.197 --> 01:24:11.520]  We're seeing all these different government leaders say that it's on in the next three months.
[01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:13.542]  Is that saber-rattling?
[01:24:13.542 --> 01:24:15.484]  I think it's more than saber-rattling.
[01:24:15.484 --> 01:24:17.585]  Let me give you a little background, Alex.
[01:24:17.585 --> 01:24:23.751]  Iran's alleged attempt to build a nuclear bomb
[01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:26.062]  A red herring, folks.
[01:24:26.062 --> 01:24:26.703]  A red herring.
[01:24:26.703 --> 01:24:36.939]  The CIA and 15 other intelligence agencies decided, made a judgment at the end of 2007, that Iran had stopped working on a nuclear weapon.
[01:24:37.654 --> 01:24:42.416]  Not on the whole nuclear program, but on the nuclear weapon, and that judgment holds, okay?
[01:24:42.416 --> 01:24:43.376]  It holds till today.
[01:24:43.376 --> 01:24:48.738]  A new estimate is being updated, is updating that, but so far that judgment holds.
[01:24:48.738 --> 01:24:56.941]  Now, number two, Iran has agreed to ship half of its low-enriched uranium out of country.
[01:24:56.941 --> 01:24:57.201]  Half.
[01:24:57.961 --> 01:24:58.862]  Wow.
[01:24:58.862 --> 01:25:11.714]  You would think that the Israelis and the U.S., those who are afraid of a nuclear weapon in Iran, they jump up and down and say, wow, that lessens the chances by about 50%.
[01:25:11.714 --> 01:25:16.699]  Instead, they go into sanctions, they go into other things that are likely to provoke Iran.
[01:25:17.299 --> 01:25:31.207]  Number three, a recent Pew poll shows that in 16 advanced countries, most people believe that it's necessary to attack Iran because of its alleged nuclear weapon.
[01:25:31.207 --> 01:25:32.047]  Okay?
[01:25:32.047 --> 01:25:33.288]  What's the most important thing?
[01:25:33.288 --> 01:25:38.731]  The most important thing is what Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu thinks of our president.
[01:25:40.132 --> 01:25:53.956]  The recent encounter that they had in the White House, where Obama fawned all over him, didn't mention the settlement, didn't mention the American citizen that Netanyahu's forces killed just two weeks before.
[01:25:53.956 --> 01:25:58.598]  Netanyahu has the impression of our president as a wuss.
[01:25:58.598 --> 01:25:59.338]  I'm from the Bronx.
[01:25:59.338 --> 01:26:02.319]  That's a combination between a wimp and a pussycat.
[01:26:03.041 --> 01:26:19.374]  And if that's his judgment, which I'm convinced it is, he's about ready to use what he considers to be his ace in the hole, the Israel lobby in this country, and do what he wishes to do with respect to Iran.
[01:26:19.374 --> 01:26:20.055]  How would it work?
[01:26:20.695 --> 01:26:27.759]  He'd send his fighter bombers just up to Iraqi airspace, which we still control, for one more month.
[01:26:27.759 --> 01:26:32.662]  He would say, he'd call, there'd be the 4am telephone call to Obama.
[01:26:32.662 --> 01:26:42.527]  Mr. Obama, I just want to let you know, we discovered some really bad stuff about nuclear weapons in Iran, so our planes are going through your airspace now.
[01:26:42.527 --> 01:26:45.789]  Make sure you tell Mike Mullen not to shoot any of them down.
[01:26:46.469 --> 01:26:53.695]  Now, there isn't one person in Washington, Alex, that thinks that Obama would have the courage to say, no, no, no, you don't.
[01:26:53.695 --> 01:26:55.737]  We're going to shoot him down.
[01:26:55.737 --> 01:26:58.179]  We are not going to shoot any Israeli planes down.
[01:26:58.179 --> 01:26:59.861]  Netanyahu knows that.
[01:26:59.861 --> 01:27:03.263]  He knows he can attack Iran, and Iran will retaliate.
[01:27:03.263 --> 01:27:06.426]  It will be in the mix big time, okay?
[01:27:06.426 --> 01:27:09.569]  The other thing that he looks at, Netanyahu does, is the election.
[01:27:10.590 --> 01:27:18.699]  Our president has shown himself allergic to do anything that would possibly put any Jewish or Israeli noses out of joint before the election.
[01:27:18.699 --> 01:27:19.861]  And so this is the time.
[01:27:19.861 --> 01:27:28.010]  I will predict that the chances are better than even that Israel will start a war with Iran next month.
[01:27:28.010 --> 01:27:28.671]  That's August 2010.
[01:27:31.303 --> 01:27:34.364]  So it's definitely going into the green light phase.
[01:27:34.364 --> 01:27:35.664]  And what about false flags?
[01:27:35.664 --> 01:27:46.048]  We saw Robert Shapiro in the Financial Times say Obama has to have an Oklahoma City or 9-11 to look strong to the public for us to win the elections.
[01:27:46.048 --> 01:27:47.308]  I mean, that was an amazing statement.
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:52.722]  Yeah, I—you know, it's just a trifle more cynical than I'm willing to go.
[01:27:52.722 --> 01:28:01.344]  I see Obama as, first and foremost, 90 percent a politician, not a constitutional lawyer, not a guy that cares about our troops.
[01:28:01.344 --> 01:28:11.908]  And it's on that basis that I judge that he considers it just not a politically feasible thing to put the reins on Netanyahu, given the strength of the Likud lobby in this country.
[01:28:12.188 --> 01:28:13.649]  Well, what do you at your gut think?
[01:28:13.649 --> 01:28:16.071]  You say more than 50 percent.
[01:28:16.071 --> 01:28:20.634]  I mean, I know you're hedging there, but I mean, clearly they're moving towards it.
[01:28:20.634 --> 01:28:24.898]  We've had the former head of the CIA, Hayden, say it's inexorable, it's going to happen.
[01:28:24.898 --> 01:28:27.279]  We hear all these noises coming out.
[01:28:27.279 --> 01:28:29.681]  Ahmadinejad believes it's going to happen in the next three months.
[01:28:29.681 --> 01:28:30.502]  You're saying August.
[01:28:31.101 --> 01:28:40.064]  Well, the thing is, Alex, that you can never be real definitive in these predictions because it still is in Obama's power to prevent this.
[01:28:40.064 --> 01:28:48.747]  And indeed, we veteran intelligence professionals for sanity are drafting a memorandum to the President right now, like tonight, okay?
[01:28:48.747 --> 01:28:56.269]  And what we're going to say is, you better publicly say, you better publicly tell Netanyahu, don't do it.
[01:28:56.269 --> 01:28:59.530]  We're not going to support you if you do, and that's enough to turn it off.
[01:28:59.830 --> 01:29:02.712]  And that's going to be at ConsortiumNews.com?
[01:29:02.712 --> 01:29:03.532]  Yes, it will be.
[01:29:03.532 --> 01:29:05.233]  Probably about three days.
[01:29:05.233 --> 01:29:06.594]  ConsortiumNews.com.
[01:29:06.594 --> 01:29:14.758]  We need to get this public statement with all of your expert analysis and bombard the White House and Congress with this report?
[01:29:14.758 --> 01:29:15.959]  Yeah, I would suggest that.
[01:29:15.959 --> 01:29:16.639]  That would be great.
[01:29:16.639 --> 01:29:17.760]  And maybe we can turn it off.
[01:29:18.444 --> 01:29:19.745]  Oh, we got about 30 seconds left.
[01:29:19.745 --> 01:29:22.226]  Anything else we can do to try to avert World War III?
[01:29:22.226 --> 01:29:36.934]  Well, I think you call your congresspeople, you call your senators, and tell them that, you know, we're past the point where we're going to be diddled by a country that pretends to be our ally and gets us in a whole peck of trouble in the Middle East.
[01:29:36.934 --> 01:29:41.756]  All right, ConsortiumNews.com is where you can read all of the great reports by Ray McGovern.
[01:29:41.756 --> 01:29:43.357]  Our website's InfoWars.com.
[01:29:43.357 --> 01:29:44.338]  Ray, talk to you again soon.
[01:29:46.158 --> 01:29:48.880]  Well, I sure hope that, uh, we don't have World War 3.
[01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:50.802]  We're gonna come back.
[01:29:50.802 --> 01:29:52.203]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.203 --> 01:29:54.725]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.725 --> 01:29:57.427]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.168 --> 01:30:04.371]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:30:04.371 --> 01:30:10.776]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:30:10.776 --> 01:30:18.162]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:30:18.162 --> 01:30:23.046]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:33:06.073 --> 01:33:12.057]  We're going to get a big update here in just a few minutes from Phil Berg on the whole birth certificate issue.
[01:33:12.057 --> 01:33:16.560]  We know he gave up his citizenship to become an Indonesian citizen, making him ineligible.
[01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:19.562]  But we'll talk about all the big developments since we had him on a few months ago.
[01:33:19.562 --> 01:33:24.385]  A lot of states moving to pass laws to make him show it coming up in the next election.
[01:33:24.385 --> 01:33:32.731]  But he's so politically destroyed now, even the Democratic Party is talking about running somebody else against him in the primaries coming up in 2011 for the 2012 elections.
[01:33:32.731 --> 01:33:32.791]  But
[01:33:36.313 --> 01:33:42.356]  Before we go to Phil Berg, the father of the birther movement, I want to tell you about a few great sponsors.
[01:33:42.356 --> 01:33:45.018]  One of them is Inner Food, Inner Health Botanicals.
[01:33:45.018 --> 01:33:50.841]  They've got this wonderful 20-ingredient green superfood you drink with water or juice or whatever you like.
[01:33:50.841 --> 01:33:56.463]  And you absorb all of it instead of just absorbing a little bit like with regular vitamins and minerals.
[01:33:56.463 --> 01:33:58.505]  And it's 20 superfoods.
[01:33:58.505 --> 01:34:02.747]  It's innerfood.com, E-N-E-R, food.com, innerfood.com.
[01:34:03.627 --> 01:34:04.888]  I drink it.
[01:34:04.888 --> 01:34:06.429]  A lot of my crew does.
[01:34:06.429 --> 01:34:07.330]  My wife loves it.
[01:34:07.330 --> 01:34:08.811]  Whenever she runs out, she's like, get more!
[01:34:08.811 --> 01:34:10.333]  Order more!
[01:34:10.333 --> 01:34:11.614]  So it's just wonderful stuff.
[01:34:11.614 --> 01:34:13.375]  Interfood.com.
[01:34:13.375 --> 01:34:15.417]  Check it out today or give them a call.
[01:34:15.417 --> 01:34:15.477]  866-762-9238.
[01:34:15.477 --> 01:34:15.717]  866-762-9238.

[01:34:17.018 --> 01:34:17.419]  Interfood.com.
[01:34:24.224 --> 01:34:27.105]  And lastly, I want to tell you about Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:34:27.105 --> 01:34:29.826]  The website's gussetclothing.com.
[01:34:29.826 --> 01:34:33.087]  Gusset spelled G-U-S-S-E-T.
[01:34:33.087 --> 01:34:35.307]  gussetclothing.com.
[01:34:35.307 --> 01:34:37.348]  Links up on infowars.com.
[01:34:37.348 --> 01:34:40.089]  They've got motorcycle jeans, regular jeans, shorts,
[01:34:40.689 --> 01:34:44.451]  Everything, it's made in America, and they're super high quality jeans.
[01:34:44.451 --> 01:34:51.295]  I've noticed since Levi's is made out of the country, I can't buy them anymore, they just split and break and don't, they're just total junk, unfortunately.
[01:34:51.295 --> 01:34:54.676]  This is made in America, they're high quality jeans.
[01:34:54.676 --> 01:35:02.801]  Give them a call, 888-8GUSSET, that's 888-8GUSSET, G-U-S-S-E-T, or gussetclothing.com.
[01:35:02.801 --> 01:35:04.902]  It's made in America, folks, and they're high quality.
[01:35:05.422 --> 01:35:08.085]  Jeans and I really love their motorcycle jeans.
[01:35:08.085 --> 01:35:10.248]  They've got Kevlar sewn into them.
[01:35:10.248 --> 01:35:11.389]  You can't beat that.
[01:35:11.389 --> 01:35:12.570]  So gussetclothing.com
[01:35:15.049 --> 01:35:21.231]  Now going to Phil J. Berg, a former Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania, former candidate for governor of the U.S.
[01:35:21.231 --> 01:35:32.273]  Senate, Democratic primaries, former chair of the Democratic Party in Montgomery County, former member of the Democratic State Committee and attorney with offices in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, and an active member in Philadelphia.
[01:35:32.273 --> 01:35:36.214]  He is a paid life member of the NAACP and a volunteer fire police for 27 years.
[01:35:36.214 --> 01:35:36.574]  And Phil Berg
[01:35:40.450 --> 01:35:45.296]  Early on, I was one of the first person to credibly start asking about the birth certificate.
[01:35:45.296 --> 01:35:56.350]  And so, sir, for those that just joined us, base, you know, state the basic facts of the birther movement and then the key information on Indonesia and all the new developments that have unfolded since then.
[01:35:57.142 --> 01:35:58.183]  Sure, pleasure to be on.
[01:35:58.183 --> 01:35:59.824]  It's an honor to be on your show, Alex.
[01:35:59.824 --> 01:36:00.885]  Good to have you.
[01:36:00.885 --> 01:36:05.688]  I respect you, and you have a great audience out there, and hello, Alex Jones fans.
[01:36:05.688 --> 01:36:07.950]  Phil Berg here, and you gave me a great introduction.
[01:36:07.950 --> 01:36:14.555]  This is now my 29th year being a volunteer fire police, and we all have to give back to our community.
[01:36:15.095 --> 01:36:17.056]  And I'm giving back to our country right now.
[01:36:17.056 --> 01:36:22.077]  This is now my 23rd month in pursuing Obama.
[01:36:22.077 --> 01:36:25.238]  My new name for him is a complete imposter.
[01:36:25.238 --> 01:36:27.998]  He's a phony, a fraud, but he's an imposter.
[01:36:27.998 --> 01:36:30.339]  And we have to do something about it.
[01:36:30.339 --> 01:36:31.459]  I'll get into the latest.
[01:36:31.459 --> 01:36:33.420]  It's still pending in the courts.
[01:36:33.420 --> 01:36:38.241]  How I got involved in this, someone called me up and said, have you heard the rumor that Obama's not natural born?
[01:36:39.039 --> 01:36:48.386]  I did a little bit, and I did some checking, and I filed the first lawsuit against Obama, August 21st, 2008, before the Democratic National Convention.
[01:36:48.386 --> 01:37:00.815]  At that time, I sued Obama and the Democratic National Committee, and I figured the Democratic National Committee would question Obama and therefore, you know, either produce documentation that he's natural born or not nominate him.
[01:37:01.936 --> 01:37:10.304]  There was collusion there between the Democratic National Committee because they didn't do anything and they actually have joined forces in fighting my lawsuit.
[01:37:10.304 --> 01:37:15.308]  I ended up filing three lawsuits and about another hundred lawsuits have been filed around the country.
[01:37:15.308 --> 01:37:18.251]  Most of them have been dismissed on the area of standing.
[01:37:18.251 --> 01:37:21.834]  The courts have said that no one has the right to challenge the Constitution.
[01:37:21.834 --> 01:37:23.075]  Unbelievable.
[01:37:23.075 --> 01:37:28.500]  But that's the court system now and if the national media had done what they should have done, and that is
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:32.682]  Properly vet Obama, he never would have been nominated.
[01:37:32.682 --> 01:37:39.166]  What the national media did to Sarah Palin is what they should have done to Obama, and he would not be where he is.
[01:37:39.166 --> 01:37:43.848]  And the national media is shaking a little, but they're still covering for Obama.
[01:37:43.848 --> 01:37:54.034]  The biggest thing is, two months before I got involved to quell the rumors, on the Obama campaign website, they put a document up there called a COBE, Certification of Live Birth.
[01:37:54.634 --> 01:37:57.775]  Trying to indicate that Obama was born in Hawaii.
[01:37:57.775 --> 01:38:00.516]  The document by experts has been proven.
[01:38:00.516 --> 01:38:04.157]  We have experts that have said it's a phony, it's been altered.
[01:38:04.157 --> 01:38:09.819]  At the very bottom it says if there's any alteration of this document, the document is invalid.
[01:38:10.399 --> 01:38:10.880]  We're good to go.
[01:38:30.113 --> 01:38:30.854]  And the feet.
[01:38:30.854 --> 01:38:33.577]  I mean, it normally has the ink-stamped feet.
[01:38:33.577 --> 01:38:37.400]  I mean, I have a copy of that with myself, so it's this receipt.
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:40.603]  And they've acted very, very secretive and will never release it.
[01:38:40.603 --> 01:38:44.206]  But then you brought out even more important intel, and that's why I was neutral on this.
[01:38:45.236 --> 01:39:09.077]  In the last two and a half years, but leaning towards it being true, and I respect you and others, but then when we learned that he did give up his citizenship, that his real name is Barry Sitaro, that when you give up your citizenship to that nation, you then are not eligible to be president, any way you slice this, he's ineligible, and then the cover-up just adds to the fact of where there's smoke, there's fire.
[01:39:09.679 --> 01:39:24.648]  Right, and you gave a great analysis there, and let me just explain that it's hard for Obama to get out of it, because in the two books that he has had about his life so young, one of them says he found his birth certificate, so he has his birth certificate.
[01:39:24.648 --> 01:39:29.831]  So, you know, why hasn't he produced the birth certificate at this time?
[01:39:29.831 --> 01:39:38.557]  The other thing is, he states that his parents were divorced, and he mentions that his mother remarried, because he mentions in his book
[01:39:39.057 --> 01:39:43.463]  That his stepfather returned to Indonesia before his mother and he did.
[01:39:43.463 --> 01:39:50.593]  And that's significant because he mentioned his stepfather and we have the school record which you are very correct Alex.
[01:39:50.593 --> 01:39:52.495]  His name is Barry Sotoro.
[01:39:52.495 --> 01:39:56.461]  So if he hasn't legally changed his name since then and there's no evidence he did,
[01:39:57.202 --> 01:39:58.323]  And he was known in college as Barry.
[01:39:58.323 --> 01:40:01.304]  He's even called into radio shows in the last year saying, hey, this is Barry.
[01:40:17.350 --> 01:40:17.791]  Yep.
[01:40:17.791 --> 01:40:20.453]  I mean, the guy is such an imposter.
[01:40:20.453 --> 01:40:21.314]  It's unbelievable.
[01:40:21.314 --> 01:40:23.116]  What about the new videos?
[01:40:23.116 --> 01:40:31.004]  Two of them of his wife saying, you know, he was born in Kenya and we went back to Kenya, the place of his birth.
[01:40:31.004 --> 01:40:34.868]  I mean, she's just out there like it's a sick joke.
[01:40:34.868 --> 01:40:35.108]  Right.
[01:40:35.108 --> 01:40:38.532]  And now that has been released lately, the past few months, but that's from 2008.
[01:40:40.113 --> 01:41:08.580]  I mean, the overwhelming evidence, and the overwhelming actual evidence and circumstantial evidence, is overwhelming that Obama was born in Africa, that he is not natural born, and because of his status over in Indonesia, I believe that he came back to the United States of Hawaii at age 10, and I believe that he came back on his Indonesia passport, and then believe it or not, he didn't go through immigration, and therefore he's not only not natural born, he's not naturalized, but he's an illegal alien!
[01:41:08.860 --> 01:41:18.724]  All right, Phil Berg, let's expand on that because the media always says, hey, why would his family put a birth announcement in the newspaper if that isn't true?
[01:41:18.724 --> 01:41:24.046]  Well, if you've got a daughter who's overseas, she's going to write, she's going to call.
[01:41:24.046 --> 01:41:25.867]  I mean, they're going to want him to be a citizen.
[01:41:25.867 --> 01:41:29.509]  They're going to want to cover their bases and carry out this fraud.
[01:41:29.509 --> 01:41:33.450]  They were high powered foundation people, you know, tied into intelligence.
[01:41:33.450 --> 01:41:34.891]  The evidence is clear.
[01:41:35.471 --> 01:41:42.698]  I mean, that's happened many times where people have dummied up that their kid was really born, you know, in the United States when they weren't.
[01:41:42.698 --> 01:41:45.220]  Well, it doesn't really even say he was born in the United States.
[01:41:45.220 --> 01:41:46.421]  It says he was born.
[01:41:46.421 --> 01:41:49.304]  My children live in different states.
[01:41:49.304 --> 01:41:53.287]  One of my daughter-in-law is expecting.
[01:41:53.287 --> 01:41:58.472]  Last year, when one of my grandchildren was born, I put an announcement in a paper here locally where I live.
[01:41:59.032 --> 01:42:01.533]  That doesn't mean they live here because they don't live here.
[01:42:01.533 --> 01:42:08.677]  And also Hawaii permitted the cold being given for someone up to a year after birth.
[01:42:08.677 --> 01:42:20.682]  So, you know, they hang their head on this cold and they hang on this two newspaper announcement of a birth on a street address which people checked out and people there said there was never a black child living there.
[01:42:20.682 --> 01:42:22.243]  So that to me is not evident.
[01:42:22.803 --> 01:42:36.632]  Like on our website we have the tape of Sarah Obama, that's his step-grandmother, in Swahili and we have the translation stating that she was in the hospital when he was born in Bombasa, Kenya on August 4th, 1961.
[01:42:36.632 --> 01:42:44.997]  And they act suspicious of grabbing and detaining reporters that go over there time and time again.
[01:42:44.997 --> 01:42:46.378]  So, very suspicious.
[01:42:47.138 --> 01:42:53.404]  Absolutely, and may she rest in peace, but his white grandmother in Hawaii, he never saw the press near her.
[01:42:53.404 --> 01:42:58.428]  She would have known where he was born, she would have known facts about it, but she never got to the press.
[01:42:58.428 --> 01:43:04.674]  And also, this is the woman who meant so much to him during his lifetime, yet when she died he didn't even fly back for her funeral.
[01:43:05.174 --> 01:43:13.305]  You know, he did it like a month later, but also two weeks before that he said she's definitely ill and I'm going to fly out in a half hour to see her.
[01:43:13.305 --> 01:43:16.349]  Then he changed his mind and flew out two days later.
[01:43:16.349 --> 01:43:20.054]  And if she's such an important person, why didn't he take his wife with him?
[01:43:20.054 --> 01:43:21.657]  Maybe the kids, but definitely his wife.
[01:43:22.177 --> 01:43:23.678]  He didn't take his wife with him.
[01:43:23.678 --> 01:43:30.300]  I mean, the whole thing, nothing makes sense with Obama about this, but what... Let me go back on the thing.
[01:43:30.300 --> 01:43:35.963]  Where I think he's not natural born and not naturalized, that's one of the cases I have pending now in the D.C.
[01:43:35.963 --> 01:43:39.744]  Circuit Court of Appeals at the Washington, D.C.
[01:43:39.744 --> 01:43:45.967]  Court of Appeals, which affirmed recently the decision to not let my case go forward, but I've now asked for a court in bond.
[01:43:45.967 --> 01:43:48.028]  I've asked for the entire court to hear my case.
[01:43:48.664 --> 01:43:57.852]  There I'm alleging that Obama is not natural born, not naturalized, but he's an illegal alien and therefore his term at the United States Senate from Illinois was fraud.
[01:43:57.852 --> 01:44:02.476]  Therefore the salary and benefits he received should be returned to the U.S.
[01:44:02.476 --> 01:44:04.098]  Treasury, which is about a million dollars.
[01:44:05.204 --> 01:44:07.045]  Those type cases are sealed.
[01:44:07.045 --> 01:44:14.328]  When I had it sealed, people wondered why all those type cases, which are called false claim factor, quid tem cases, are sealed.
[01:44:14.328 --> 01:44:22.471]  They're mainly used in Medicaid and Medicare fraud cases, and they're sealed because the person you're bringing them against is not notified of the case.
[01:44:22.471 --> 01:44:31.355]  It goes to the Justice Department and the Attorney General's Office for them to review the case in 60 days and make a decision of, one, are they going to prosecute the case?
[01:44:31.355 --> 01:44:33.636]  Two, are they going to let the person who brought the case
[01:44:34.076 --> 01:44:38.601]  In this case, what's called a relager, where three dismiss the case.
[01:44:38.601 --> 01:44:40.764]  Very few cases are dismissed.
[01:44:40.764 --> 01:44:43.227]  They decide to dismiss my case against Obama.
[01:44:44.051 --> 01:44:47.352]  And I raise the issue of conflict of interest.
[01:44:47.352 --> 01:44:55.436]  And Alex, if this scenario is not conflict of interest, we should take those words out of the dictionary and out of the legal dictionary and out of the legal system.
[01:44:55.436 --> 01:45:00.778]  I mean the fact that the decision is made by the Department of Justice and the Attorney General's office.
[01:45:00.778 --> 01:45:01.738]  Who's the head of that?
[01:45:01.738 --> 01:45:03.639]  The Attorney General of the United States.
[01:45:03.639 --> 01:45:05.160]  Who's the Attorney General of the United States?
[01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:06.300]  Eric Holder.
[01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:10.562]  Well, Eric Holder, number one, was a senior member of Obama's campaign staff.
[01:45:11.122 --> 01:45:18.664]  Number two, he was one of three individuals selected by Obama to select a Vice President who eventually selected Biden.
[01:45:18.664 --> 01:45:27.127]  And number three, he was nominated, appointed, and confirmed as Attorney General, the highest law enforcement officer in the country, who reports to the President.
[01:45:27.127 --> 01:45:30.948]  So if that person is not a conflict of interest, I don't know what is.
[01:45:30.948 --> 01:45:33.829]  So that's where I'm at now with the D.C.
[01:45:33.829 --> 01:45:34.969]  Court of Appeals.
[01:45:34.969 --> 01:45:36.369]  Hopefully they'll have a court in Boston.
[01:45:36.369 --> 01:45:38.210]  If not, we're going to take that case up to the U.S.
[01:45:38.210 --> 01:45:38.810]  Supreme Court.
[01:45:39.974 --> 01:45:43.959]  Well let me say this, you've definitely won in the court of public opinion.
[01:45:43.959 --> 01:45:50.106]  A lot of congress people and others will come out and say that they think the birth certificate issue is legitimate.
[01:45:50.106 --> 01:45:55.672]  There's no doubt the Indonesian citizenship, we've got a president with a fake made up name, that's confirmed.
[01:45:56.974 --> 01:46:18.487]  That's why the controlled corporate media keeps getting so mad that we won't shut up about this, and that it just keeps gaining ground in national polls, because when somebody looks at the actual evidence, it is overwhelming that there's a massive cover-up and he's ineligible just on the Indonesian citizenship and name issue, and that's why they've got all of his college records.
[01:46:19.409 --> 01:46:20.650]  So sealed.
[01:46:20.650 --> 01:46:24.231]  And so his approval rating's gone from 85% down to 40.
[01:46:24.231 --> 01:46:29.654]  He's got the lowest approval rating of any president this far into their situation.
[01:46:29.654 --> 01:46:32.375]  But then there's the issue you raised years ago on this show.
[01:46:32.375 --> 01:46:33.735]  He's compromised.
[01:46:33.735 --> 01:46:41.459]  The establishment knows he's an Indonesian citizen, bare minimum, almost certainly born in Kenya, a Kenyan citizen born.
[01:46:41.459 --> 01:46:45.701]  They know that, so imagine how they're able to blackmail him with this information.
[01:46:46.238 --> 01:46:47.479]  Oh, I definitely think he's bad.
[01:46:47.479 --> 01:46:52.781]  Well, I think that that's why most of the speeches he gives are on teleprompter.
[01:46:52.781 --> 01:46:53.521]  He's reading them.
[01:46:53.521 --> 01:46:55.862]  He's great to deliver a speech off a teleprompter.
[01:46:55.862 --> 01:46:57.502]  Not as good elsewhere.
[01:46:57.502 --> 01:46:58.823]  But he's told what to say.
[01:46:58.823 --> 01:47:01.744]  And I think our whole country is in jeopardy because of it.
[01:47:01.744 --> 01:47:05.666]  This health care bill is blatantly, as far as I'm concerned, unconstitutional.
[01:47:05.666 --> 01:47:07.686]  And many other things he's doing.
[01:47:07.686 --> 01:47:12.708]  And that's why, and through your help, we had scheduled a recall march back on Memorial Day.
[01:47:12.708 --> 01:47:14.149]  We had to cancel that for a certain reason.
[01:47:14.933 --> 01:47:22.262]  Excuse me, we haven't rescheduled yet, but it looks like we're going to have it in October, getting near election time, because I think people's interest will be up.
[01:47:22.262 --> 01:47:23.843]  Why did you have to reschedule?
[01:47:23.843 --> 01:47:28.809]  Well, because more and more and several groups want to join in with me, and we didn't have enough time to plan it right.
[01:47:28.809 --> 01:47:30.011]  I want to have this March.
[01:47:30.011 --> 01:47:31.833]  We're working on a date now for October.
[01:47:32.293 --> 01:47:35.135]  And I want it to be the largest march in Washington, D.C.
[01:47:35.135 --> 01:47:38.517]  history, because this affront to our U.S.
[01:47:38.517 --> 01:47:46.382]  Constitution is the biggest hoax against the Constitution, against our country, against our citizens, in 324 years.
[01:47:46.382 --> 01:47:50.545]  I'm sorry, 234 years, since our Constitution came into effect.
[01:47:50.545 --> 01:47:54.467]  You know, the comparison has to be, for people out there, the question.
[01:47:54.467 --> 01:47:55.808]  Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:47:55.808 --> 01:48:00.010]  People have talked to him for 10, 15 years about running for president, and he constantly
[01:48:01.051 --> 01:48:02.372]  Amend the Constitution.
[01:48:02.372 --> 01:48:03.813]  I was born in Austria.
[01:48:03.813 --> 01:48:05.274]  Amend the Constitution?
[01:48:05.274 --> 01:48:13.501]  I was born... You know, he could just change his name, though, to like, Billy Bob and say, I was born in California!
[01:48:13.501 --> 01:48:16.543]  He could run on the Obama theory from now on.
[01:48:16.543 --> 01:48:19.345]  Obama is destroying the Constitution.
[01:48:19.345 --> 01:48:23.409]  Obama has basically said, I don't care about the Constitution.
[01:48:23.409 --> 01:48:25.230]  He's basically walking all over the Constitution.
[01:48:25.290 --> 01:48:29.051]  It is a conspiracy theory that I was born in Austria!
[01:48:29.051 --> 01:48:31.291]  I was born in California!
[01:48:31.291 --> 01:48:32.392]  Right, right.
[01:48:32.392 --> 01:48:41.614]  How about Obama, when he was, I think, back in the spring of 2008, when everyone else was saluting the flag, he was standing there with his arm down the side.
[01:48:41.614 --> 01:48:45.194]  How about when he would never wear an American flag lapel pin?
[01:48:45.194 --> 01:48:46.235]  You know, he's changed that.
[01:48:48.255 --> 01:48:53.136]  The biggest thing, as far as I'm concerned, he goes around the world apologizing to the United States.
[01:48:53.136 --> 01:48:55.097]  Then he bows down to the sortie king.
[01:48:55.097 --> 01:48:57.218]  He bows down to the Japanese emperor.
[01:48:57.218 --> 01:48:58.638]  He bows down to the leader of China.
[01:48:58.638 --> 01:49:01.659]  And then they lie each time and say that he's dropped something.
[01:49:01.659 --> 01:49:07.480]  I mean, he just, oh, your majesty, oh, oh, oh, you're so great.
[01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:09.421]  And they're like, oh, he was picking up something.
[01:49:09.821 --> 01:49:12.845]  Yeah, he was picking up.
[01:49:12.845 --> 01:49:18.551]  But just what he has done has destroyed the image of the United States around the world.
[01:49:18.551 --> 01:49:19.752]  Your Majesty!
[01:49:19.752 --> 01:49:21.735]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:49:21.735 --> 01:49:30.204]  No, and that's why as soon as we get a date here I'm going to be back on your show and we're going to ask people to come because this is the biggest... I don't care what your issue is with Obama.
[01:49:30.985 --> 01:49:43.877]  But think about it, if your issue is taxation, if your issue is education, if your issue is medical, whatever your issue is, it all falls back, and then I'm appealing in a way to all the Tea Party people, you have different issues out there.
[01:49:43.877 --> 01:49:49.362]  But the main controlling issue is the fact he's a usurper, he's a phony, he's a fraud, he's an imposter.
[01:49:49.362 --> 01:49:56.589]  If I am right, and I know I am, if the courts won't handle this, we the American people getting together can demand
[01:49:57.089 --> 01:50:08.436]  And if we can bring in one to two million people to Washington, D.C., and we can have them there and bring a copy of your birth certificate, and everyone hold over their head their copy, then national media will have to cover this.
[01:50:08.436 --> 01:50:18.162]  And I really believe we can force Obama out of office, because once the American people stand for... See, I believe that not enough American public knows about this.
[01:50:18.162 --> 01:50:23.665]  Because, remember, you need a real, live birth certificate to register your child for a little baby.
[01:50:23.665 --> 01:50:24.786]  Well, I mean, listen, listen.
[01:50:25.766 --> 01:50:27.967]  If he had it, he would have released it.
[01:50:27.967 --> 01:50:30.887]  He's been very suspicious about this.
[01:50:30.887 --> 01:50:35.668]  But regardless, let's say we're wrong and he was born in Hawaii, which the evidence shows is not the case.
[01:50:35.668 --> 01:50:36.789]  He was born in Kenya.
[01:50:36.789 --> 01:50:40.329]  His real name is Barry Sotero.
[01:50:40.329 --> 01:50:43.430]  He is an Indonesian citizen and went to an Islamic school.
[01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:45.931]  And I'm not saying it's bad that he went to an Islamic school.
[01:50:45.931 --> 01:50:48.992]  The point is, the guy is as phony as a $3 bill who he says
[01:50:51.272 --> 01:50:51.853]  He is.
[01:50:51.853 --> 01:50:54.115]  His name is Barry Sotaro.
[01:50:54.115 --> 01:50:55.656]  Barry Sotaro.
[01:50:55.656 --> 01:50:56.877]  We've got him!
[01:50:56.877 --> 01:50:58.278]  That guy's an imposter.
[01:50:58.278 --> 01:50:59.259]  Phil Berg, you're right.
[01:50:59.259 --> 01:50:59.899]  Final segment.
[01:50:59.899 --> 01:51:00.240]  Stay with us.

[01:53:00.922 --> 01:53:02.204]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:53:02.204 --> 01:53:07.811]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:53:07.811 --> 01:53:12.838]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:53:12.838 --> 01:53:17.864]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.

[01:54:15.930 --> 01:54:18.131]  That's GCNLive.com.
[01:54:18.131 --> 01:54:19.391]  Paul Craig Roberts says U.S.
[01:54:19.391 --> 01:54:20.812]  Treasury is running on fumes.
[01:54:20.812 --> 01:54:23.593]  Key article, grim tidings from the Netherlands.
[01:54:23.593 --> 01:54:28.034]  Prince Bernhard's grandchildren continue Bilderberg legacy.
[01:54:28.034 --> 01:54:31.475]  Key report up there.
[01:54:31.475 --> 01:54:35.917]  Also Google and CIA plow through millions into huge

[01:54:49.027 --> 01:54:50.908]  Kurt Nemo, also at GCNLive.com.
[01:54:50.908 --> 01:54:53.189]  And all this is also at InfoWars.com.
[01:54:53.189 --> 01:54:56.610]  And another big report that Rob Dew wrote.
[01:54:56.610 --> 01:54:58.791]  WorldNet Daily Writer says, fluoride is good for you.
[01:54:58.791 --> 01:54:59.912]  An open letter to the writer.
[01:55:00.652 --> 01:55:03.633]  Very well documented if you want a lot of key fluoride facts.
[01:55:03.633 --> 01:55:06.673]  That's all at GCNlive.com.
[01:55:06.673 --> 01:55:18.115]  Going back to Attorney Phil Berg, also former Deputy Attorney General in Pennsylvania, really the first guy to credibly go after Obama on the birth certificate and the Indonesia issues.
[01:55:18.115 --> 01:55:19.756]  We've got about three, four minutes left.
[01:55:19.756 --> 01:55:20.896]  Any other key developments?
[01:55:20.896 --> 01:55:25.317]  What do you think about states moving to pass laws to force him to give them the birth certificate?
[01:55:25.317 --> 01:55:26.497]  Didn't Arizona pass that?
[01:55:27.185 --> 01:55:33.108]  No, it was introduced and the House passed it, I think, and the Senate didn't pass it.
[01:55:33.108 --> 01:55:37.490]  But you can know there's a phony here because Representative Posey in Florida, a U.S.
[01:55:37.490 --> 01:55:47.275]  Congressman, Republican, introduced legislation that all presidential candidates as of 2012 must show that their natural-born status to be qualified.
[01:55:47.275 --> 01:55:49.977]  About eight other Republicans joined it, but no Democrats.
[01:55:49.977 --> 01:55:51.638]  Now, why did no Democrats join in?
[01:55:51.638 --> 01:55:52.898]  Because they know he's a fraud.
[01:55:52.898 --> 01:55:53.799]  They know he's a phony.
[01:55:54.319 --> 01:56:03.568]  If I may give a pitch here, our website is Obamacrimes.com, O-B-A-M-A-C-R-I-M-E-S dot com dot C-O-M, Obamacrimes.com.
[01:56:03.568 --> 01:56:04.629]  Right now we need some help.
[01:56:04.629 --> 01:56:05.369]  We need some money.
[01:56:05.369 --> 01:56:09.313]  We're going to raise some money because we want to advertise this march as we have the day.
[01:56:09.313 --> 01:56:12.156]  We want as many people in this country to be aware of this.
[01:56:12.156 --> 01:56:13.417]  I believe people in this country.
[01:56:13.797 --> 01:56:15.058]  I do not know about this.
[01:56:15.058 --> 01:56:21.820]  I think the majority of people don't know, and if they did know, we could have 10 million people in Washington because this is such an outrage.
[01:56:21.820 --> 01:56:28.002]  You know, there's, you might differ on different policies or, you know, Republican ideas, Democrat ideas.
[01:56:28.002 --> 01:56:31.383]  This crosses, like, I'm a Democrat, but this crosses everything.
[01:56:31.383 --> 01:56:33.224]  This crosses the line completely.
[01:56:33.224 --> 01:56:36.545]  Well, if they can get away with this, the sky's the limit.
[01:56:36.545 --> 01:56:37.326]  Well, I do this.
[01:56:37.326 --> 01:56:39.506]  I say the most important thing we have is what?
[01:56:39.506 --> 01:56:40.067]  Is the U.S.
[01:56:40.067 --> 01:56:40.687]  Constitution.
[01:56:41.267 --> 01:56:48.138]  There's nothing more important than the Constitution, and the 305, 308 million people in the country deserve to know the truth.
[01:56:48.138 --> 01:56:53.866]  Our forefathers need us to fight for this, and the men and women who have served valiantly in our wars over the years, 1.6 million,
[01:56:55.436 --> 01:56:56.036]  We're good to go.
[01:57:19.813 --> 01:57:20.573]  Spread the word.
[01:57:20.573 --> 01:57:24.295]  It's such an honor to be on your show again, Alex.
[01:57:24.295 --> 01:57:25.576]  Obamacrimes.com.
[01:57:25.576 --> 01:57:26.036]  Help us.
[01:57:26.036 --> 01:57:28.818]  As soon as the date comes out, I'm going to be back on your show.
[01:57:28.818 --> 01:57:32.319]  And we're going to make sure that this is the largest march in Washington, D.C.
[01:57:32.319 --> 01:57:35.141]  history, because there's nothing more important than the U.S.
[01:57:35.141 --> 01:57:35.801]  Constitution.
[01:57:35.801 --> 01:57:40.723]  And if we bring Obama down, his government health care, all of it will also be reversed.
[01:57:40.723 --> 01:57:43.105]  Phil Berg, look forward to talking to you as the march nears.
[01:57:43.105 --> 01:57:43.605]  God bless you.
[01:57:43.965 --> 01:57:45.146]  Thank you, my pleasure.
[01:57:45.146 --> 01:57:45.486]  You bet.
[01:57:45.486 --> 01:57:47.066]  There goes Phil Berg.
[01:57:47.066 --> 01:57:50.088]  We're basically out of time for this hour.
[01:57:50.088 --> 01:57:59.272]  Coming up in the next hour, I'm going to get into the whole Google spying and the fact that they claim they can predict the future now by tracking everything that you're doing.
[01:57:59.272 --> 01:58:02.593]  If you don't have an AM and FM that carries all of the show, ask them to.
[01:58:02.593 --> 01:58:04.714]  Be sure and support our local sponsors.
[01:58:04.714 --> 01:58:06.615]  But also, you can always listen to the free podcast.

[01:58:19.361 --> 01:58:22.602]  We've been getting about three or four new affiliates a week.
[01:58:22.602 --> 01:58:24.603]  Six months ago it was about two a week.
[01:58:24.603 --> 01:58:29.165]  I mean the show is just exploding and we want to thank all the stations that do pick up the show.
[01:58:29.165 --> 01:58:34.027]  Be sure and support those local sponsors and please spread the word.
[01:58:34.027 --> 01:58:37.388]  Tell everybody how you listen to the show and how they can listen.
[01:58:37.388 --> 01:58:39.069]  That's how we're going to reach more people.
[01:58:43.087 --> 01:58:46.517]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.517 --> 01:58:48.743]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[01:58:50.376 --> 01:58:55.340]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:58:55.340 --> 01:58:56.340]  What have we got?
[01:58:56.340 --> 01:58:58.782]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:58:58.782 --> 01:58:59.783]  A republic.
[01:58:59.783 --> 01:59:02.445]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:59:02.445 --> 01:59:04.707]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:59:04.707 --> 01:59:06.728]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:59:06.728 --> 01:59:08.409]  So they think they own our land?
[01:59:08.409 --> 01:59:09.730]  They think they own our water?
[01:59:09.730 --> 01:59:10.331]  Children?
[01:59:10.331 --> 01:59:11.452]  Our education?
[01:59:11.452 --> 01:59:12.292]  Our money?
[01:59:12.292 --> 01:59:15.935]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:59:16.295 --> 01:59:21.280]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:22.301]  We have the facts.
[01:59:22.301 --> 01:59:23.462]  We have the Constitution.
[01:59:23.462 --> 01:59:24.363]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:59:24.363 --> 01:59:25.244]  We have common law.
[01:59:25.244 --> 01:59:27.766]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:59:27.766 --> 01:59:31.550]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:59:31.650 --> 01:59:36.614]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:59:36.614 --> 01:59:38.115]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:59:38.115 --> 01:59:39.196]  Don't tread on me.
[01:59:39.196 --> 01:59:53.367]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:59:53.367 --> 01:59:55.729]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.729 --> 01:59:58.511]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:06.144 --> 02:00:10.966]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.966 --> 02:00:12.547]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.547 --> 02:00:14.108]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.108 --> 02:00:18.290]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.290 --> 02:00:25.094]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.094 --> 02:00:27.215]  We are now into hour number three.
[02:00:27.215 --> 02:00:29.856]  Max Keiser coming up in this next segment.
[02:00:29.856 --> 02:00:31.477]  I'm going to take a few of your phone calls.
[02:00:31.477 --> 02:00:33.618]  I'll continue to blitz through key news.
[02:00:33.618 --> 02:00:35.279]  Haven't gotten to even a third of it yet.
[02:00:36.311 --> 02:00:37.472]  God bless you, Alex.
[02:00:37.472 --> 02:00:38.534]  It's been worth the wait.
[02:00:38.534 --> 02:00:40.696]  Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that I've got a
[02:00:52.709 --> 02:00:53.871]  I just thought of a pun.
[02:00:53.871 --> 02:00:56.093]  We're going to undo the dupes with the dupes.
[02:01:17.952 --> 02:01:19.353]  Right on, bro.
[02:01:19.353 --> 02:01:21.015]  Anyway, I love Austin, Texas.
[02:01:21.015 --> 02:01:26.720]  I haven't been there in about 25 years, but everybody was really nice down there.
[02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:29.142]  I used to be a musician until I messed up my left arm.
[02:01:29.142 --> 02:01:31.304]  Anyway, I still play music.
[02:01:31.304 --> 02:01:37.789]  Anyway, I just wanted to ask, like, why hasn't anybody arrested this Obama puke yet, you know?
[02:01:37.789 --> 02:01:44.075]  I mean, it's like he's already using a false social security number, so I mean, like, isn't that like identity theft right there?
[02:01:44.735 --> 02:01:54.642]  Well, Obama is terrible and a globalist and a teleprompter reading lawyer, but he himself is just a puppet and is in free fall now, so they'll bring a new puppet in.
[02:01:54.642 --> 02:02:00.887]  You know, why haven't we arrested the heads of the major banks that openly sold the derivatives knowing it was fraud?
[02:02:00.887 --> 02:02:06.031]  And why did the federal government just say, oh, you didn't engage in any fraud last week and let Goldman Sachs off?
[02:02:06.031 --> 02:02:07.992]  You know, that's the bigger issue.
[02:02:07.992 --> 02:02:13.076]  I mean, Obama is just a birdcage dropping compared to the bird that's the New World Order.
[02:02:13.803 --> 02:02:19.470]  Yeah, but you know, it's like all those executive orders he's signed since the phony inauguration.
[02:02:19.470 --> 02:02:23.975]  I mean, like, all of that would go away if we could just, you know, like...
[02:02:24.731 --> 02:02:28.494]  Alex, I feel like you're my brother.
[02:02:54.710 --> 02:02:55.931]  You are my brother, my friend.
[02:02:55.931 --> 02:02:57.212]  We love liberty.
[02:02:57.212 --> 02:02:58.653]  That's right.
[02:02:58.653 --> 02:03:05.037]  From the home of the highest property taxes in the United States, I've been following you now for about a year.
[02:03:05.037 --> 02:03:07.298]  I haven't had the internet for a while anyway.
[02:03:07.298 --> 02:03:16.845]  What I wanted to get to was, I really liked Clint Eastwood movies for a long time, and the Josie Wills movie goes into the corruption that was started back during the Civil War.
[02:03:17.979 --> 02:03:20.640]  I really, I really kind of like the way that they put that across.
[02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:25.401]  You know, you get an idea... Well, no, that's what happened for five years or more during Reconstruction.
[02:03:25.401 --> 02:03:29.142]  Just bands of criminals ran around murdering people en masse.
[02:03:29.142 --> 02:03:38.464]  We have family cemeteries with tombstones, with people, and it says on the tombstone, you know, killed by Northern troops after the war.
[02:03:38.464 --> 02:03:41.705]  Raping, murdering, killing, it was just so enjoyable.
[02:03:41.705 --> 02:03:42.365]  Right.
[02:03:42.365 --> 02:03:45.306]  Well, my main concern is
[02:03:46.013 --> 02:03:48.934]  Where in heck are the white hats in the United States?
[02:03:48.934 --> 02:04:00.718]  I mean, for a long time before I came involved with you, I was looking for the senator or somebody to come up in the middle of front of TV, pounding his fist, saying four-letter words on the television.
[02:04:00.718 --> 02:04:01.559]  What is going on?
[02:04:01.559 --> 02:04:02.639]  We've got to stop this.
[02:04:02.639 --> 02:04:03.759]  This is what we're going to do.
[02:04:03.759 --> 02:04:06.120]  You know, somebody to stand up and be the leader.
[02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:08.121]  And I really appreciate what you do.
[02:04:08.121 --> 02:04:10.462]  And then I find myself thinking about
[02:04:10.922 --> 02:04:17.646]  The positive and negative of everything, the good and evil, and I thank God you get the Christian values that you expose every day.
[02:04:17.646 --> 02:04:23.550]  The fact that every little molecule of every atom of every molecule is a positive and negative, pulling and tugging on each other.
[02:04:23.550 --> 02:04:26.532]  The good and evil is a positive and negative pulling on each other.
[02:04:26.532 --> 02:04:32.135]  This whole world is made up of a positive and negative, and for the life of me, I can't believe that this has gone on this long.
[02:04:32.375 --> 02:04:36.738]  And we've got to learn to recognize evil and stand up against it, or it will take over.
[02:04:36.738 --> 02:04:38.278]  God bless you, good to hear from you.
[02:04:38.278 --> 02:04:40.680]  Al, Joe, BJ, many others, your calls are coming up.
[02:04:40.680 --> 02:04:46.863]  Max Keiser on the economy, and a lot more straight ahead with his once a month visit with us.
[02:04:46.863 --> 02:04:56.949]  We're searching the term today, Google Spies, so it'll lead them to an article that has the re-uploaded Obama deception there for everybody, and the history of Google spying.
[02:04:56.949 --> 02:04:59.471]  It's key, Google the term, Google Spies, today.
[02:05:00.404 --> 02:05:04.947]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:04.947 --> 02:05:05.868]  Number 1.
[02:05:05.868 --> 02:05:09.291]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:09.291 --> 02:05:10.151]  Number 2.
[02:05:10.151 --> 02:05:15.035]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:15.035 --> 02:05:15.775]  It's true.
[02:05:15.775 --> 02:05:20.659]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:20.659 --> 02:05:21.480]  Number 3.
[02:05:21.480 --> 02:05:25.062]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:25.062 --> 02:05:28.765]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:28.965 --> 02:05:29.766]  Number 4.
[02:05:29.766 --> 02:05:32.528]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:32.528 --> 02:05:36.211]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:36.211 --> 02:05:36.991]  Number 5.
[02:05:36.991 --> 02:05:41.154]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:41.154 --> 02:05:45.898]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:08:01.744 --> 02:08:10.829]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:10.829 --> 02:08:14.471]  Max Keiser joining us from Paris is our guest, MaxKeiser.com.
[02:08:14.471 --> 02:08:18.413]  He's hosted BBC TV shows, RT shows, press TV programs.
[02:08:18.413 --> 02:08:23.616]  He has an RT and press TV show right now, a show on Genesis Saturdays.
[02:08:23.616 --> 02:08:27.639]  And of course he's the inventor of the Hollywood Stock Exchange system, much of that technology used today.
[02:08:28.599 --> 02:08:32.611]  He was working in and around the Twin Towers on 9-11, has helped expose that.
[02:08:32.611 --> 02:08:34.296]  And I said, what do you want to talk about, Max?
[02:08:34.296 --> 02:08:35.159]  He said, I want to talk about...
[02:08:36.405 --> 02:08:38.787]  A hidden world growing beyond control.
[02:08:38.787 --> 02:08:44.411]  Close to a million NSA and CIA private operatives now.
[02:08:44.411 --> 02:08:44.431]  854,000.
[02:08:44.431 --> 02:08:49.014]  And the Washington Post itself, a spook factory.
[02:08:49.014 --> 02:08:53.737]  You know, a month ago they admitted that the CIA created fake Bin Laden videos.
[02:08:53.737 --> 02:08:55.038]  We told you those were fake years ago.
[02:08:55.038 --> 02:08:57.420]  But now they just throw it in your face.
[02:08:57.420 --> 02:08:59.141]  A hidden world growing beyond control.
[02:08:59.141 --> 02:09:01.983]  And who's a big part of the national security clearances?
[02:09:01.983 --> 02:09:02.503]  Google.
[02:09:02.503 --> 02:09:02.904]  YouTube.
[02:09:03.644 --> 02:09:05.185]  They are the NSA.
[02:09:05.185 --> 02:09:06.726]  And that's all in this article.
[02:09:06.726 --> 02:09:15.771]  And I want to get into Goldman Sachs being slapped on the wrist, the Federal Reserve being given more power over our economy, with the passage of the financial overhaul last week with Max.
[02:09:15.771 --> 02:09:17.893]  But Max wanted to talk about the Obama deception first.
[02:09:17.893 --> 02:09:20.174]  He said, this is big news.
[02:09:20.174 --> 02:09:27.679]  And literally now, I said 20, it's now hundreds of newspapers and blogs, big ones, are reporting on the censorship of the Obama deception.
[02:09:27.679 --> 02:09:28.799]  And this is the first time ever.
[02:09:28.799 --> 02:09:31.601]  It happened with one music video before that had over 200 million views.
[02:09:31.601 --> 02:09:31.901]  This one, 6.5.
[02:09:33.462 --> 02:09:36.049]  Million.
[02:09:36.049 --> 02:09:40.760]  If it says a user's removed it, which was the hack, you cannot put it back up.
[02:09:40.760 --> 02:09:42.284]  Anybody who has a YouTube channel knows that.
[02:09:42.284 --> 02:09:42.685]  It's gone.
[02:09:43.735 --> 02:09:53.860]  They didn't just restore the director channel video, they restored every video that Kenneth Webb had ever deleted himself, or any video that had been removed for terms of use.
[02:09:53.860 --> 02:10:02.985]  His whole account, going back five years, he's had one over five years, he's got a director's account, a founder account, it's even more than a director account, he's one of the first people on YouTube.
[02:10:03.965 --> 02:10:05.527]  Because, you know, we don't have a director account.
[02:10:05.527 --> 02:10:08.109]  Somebody gave us one and YouTube wouldn't let us have it last year.
[02:10:08.109 --> 02:10:12.334]  So this fellow, you know, this great guy, he uploaded it.
[02:10:12.334 --> 02:10:16.979]  There's thousands of other versions on YouTube and Google, but they're broken up in 10-minute pieces.
[02:10:16.979 --> 02:10:18.600]  A million here, 800,000 there, half a million here, 400,000 there.
[02:10:21.363 --> 02:10:24.488]  This one, though, was the top link when you searched the name Obama.
[02:10:24.488 --> 02:10:28.175]  Not just the top in the trends, with my listeners putting that in, to make it the top of Google Trends.
[02:10:28.175 --> 02:10:28.695]  No, no.
[02:10:28.695 --> 02:10:34.565]  It was, on its own, the number one thing in the world when you said President Obama, Barack Obama, or Obama.
[02:10:35.706 --> 02:10:40.388]  It knocked us out of the top searches when they did this, but today when they put it back up, it's already number five.
[02:10:40.388 --> 02:10:43.149]  When you'd say Barack Obama, President Obama, or Obama.
[02:10:43.149 --> 02:10:45.871]  And you bet, it's gonna be number one the next week.
[02:10:45.871 --> 02:10:47.011]  I predict.
[02:10:47.011 --> 02:10:54.815]  You go in there, you click on it in the search engine, put Obama deception in, you see the link to the full length video, you click on that, drive it to number one.
[02:10:54.815 --> 02:10:58.417]  Max, I mean, this is crazy that this is going on.
[02:10:58.417 --> 02:10:59.157]  What's your take on it?
[02:11:00.111 --> 02:11:03.474]  Okay, well, Washington Post just came out with their big report.
[02:11:03.474 --> 02:11:05.777]  They spent two years with this report.
[02:11:05.777 --> 02:11:09.540]  They've got a website called Top Secret America.
[02:11:09.540 --> 02:11:14.325]  850,000 people in America are on the highest clearance for secrecy.
[02:11:14.325 --> 02:11:21.893]  And they cobbled together all the companies that are working together to create what they call a fourth branch of government.
[02:11:22.293 --> 02:11:22.953]  We're good to go.
[02:11:42.686 --> 02:12:06.483]  It's obviously InfoWars, and you know you correctly predicted this years ago, that information would be the battleground, and you're fighting the InfoWars, and you've been fighting really against this clandestine, multi-hundred billion dollar, secret part of the American government, and obviously when you put something up like the Obama deception,
[02:12:07.183 --> 02:12:24.057]  And you've got folks who are pushing that up and dominating the search results and skewing the public's perception in the very carefully crafted publicity and propaganda to keep people away from thinking intelligently about some of the wrongs being done.
[02:12:24.057 --> 02:12:31.864]  They have to act, and they act in the way that we've just seen them act, but you're getting so big now that apparently you got them to reverse themselves, so kudos to you!
[02:12:32.731 --> 02:12:37.215]  Well, I have to tell you, Max, my sixth sense, my spidey sense is off the charts.
[02:12:37.215 --> 02:12:43.101]  This is not fun, getting this much attention, but I've set out to mobilize the people to defeat these globalists.
[02:12:43.101 --> 02:12:51.348]  And what you hit on, and what the Washington Post admits in this top-secret America two-year report, this is them coming out in the open.
[02:12:51.348 --> 02:12:53.911]  The Washington Post is the top Bilderberg Group paper.
[02:12:53.911 --> 02:12:56.653]  The Grams have been attending for 50-plus years, the owners.
[02:12:58.015 --> 02:13:05.843]  They are the ones that are there to whitewash everything, and they basically claim they're reporting on it, but they're really just selling it to people.
[02:13:05.843 --> 02:13:12.630]  When I read the SPP documents that Judicial Watch sued and got three years ago that I talked so much about, there is the Fortune 100.
[02:13:13.331 --> 02:13:18.114]  A little over 100 companies, the top ones there, at this BAMF Canada meeting, and they've had others.
[02:13:18.114 --> 02:13:23.357]  And the first item of agenda was, this is under international corporate government security.
[02:13:23.357 --> 02:13:25.199]  All of you were sworn to secrecy.
[02:13:25.199 --> 02:13:27.620]  We need a carbon tax to fund the world government.
[02:13:27.620 --> 02:13:30.002]  We're going to shut down all the industries.
[02:13:30.002 --> 02:13:33.144]  And this corporate body is going to vote, and then
[02:13:33.684 --> 02:13:33.864]  I think?
[02:13:48.980 --> 02:14:01.447]  They're merging the four branches of the military with Google, with YouTube, with Yahoo, with Oracle, with a handful of others, and they all admit they're going to take the web over, block everybody else, they'll get all the business.
[02:14:01.447 --> 02:14:08.912]  There's a revolving door between government and these corporations, so the people in government will then get jobs with them and then go back into government and around and around.
[02:14:08.912 --> 02:14:12.374]  And this is a total global corporate coup over everything.
[02:14:12.714 --> 02:14:24.442]  With 800 plus thousand private corporate spies, part of InfraGard, where they are all government agents with license to kill powers, according to mainstream news two years ago, via InfraGard.
[02:14:24.442 --> 02:14:29.785]  They are being trained to literally kill employees if they ever try to save the country.
[02:14:29.785 --> 02:14:32.026]  I mean, this is hell world.
[02:14:32.026 --> 02:14:35.729]  This makes the Nazis look tame in organizational skill, Max.
[02:14:37.031 --> 02:14:50.054]  Well, I agree with you that major media, mainstream media, including the Washington Post, are totally compromised by what you call the globalists, what are now being referred to openly as top-secret America.
[02:14:50.054 --> 02:15:03.597]  But I think that occasionally some truth manages to get through, and if it becomes a big enough problem, then move to position B, which of course is your false flag attack.
[02:15:03.597 --> 02:15:04.957]  In other words, I don't
[02:15:04.957 --> 02:15:22.242]  Without the credibility of this report, what I think it came through, now at the 11th hour, apparently insiders at the paper and the media wanted to block this publication or wanted to find out more about what was in the publication, but now it's out, it's on the web, people are seeing it, so now I believe the timing
[02:15:22.922 --> 02:15:26.687]  For the false flag is here because this is a bombshell report.
[02:15:26.687 --> 02:15:29.972]  This is gonna really send shockwaves throughout Washington.
[02:15:29.972 --> 02:15:32.815]  I want you to elaborate, but I want to interject here.
[02:15:32.815 --> 02:15:35.118]  If one three hundredth of the nation
[02:15:36.417 --> 02:15:39.439]  And that's counting men, women, and children, so it's even higher.
[02:15:39.439 --> 02:15:51.709]  If 1 out of 300 is a top-secret spy, and they admittedly, for every top-secret spy, they probably have as many as 10 auxiliaries.
[02:15:51.709 --> 02:15:58.214]  I mean, you're talking about a Stasi-level number where probably 10% of the people in the country are now spies at one level or another.
[02:15:59.134 --> 02:16:00.495]  For this corporate takeover.
[02:16:00.495 --> 02:16:03.618]  I mean, and they're funding themselves with tax money.
[02:16:03.618 --> 02:16:04.819]  This is a takeover.
[02:16:04.819 --> 02:16:06.620]  This is a criminal enterprise.
[02:16:06.620 --> 02:16:14.106]  Just like Goldman Sachs for 30 years put their people in every management and regulatory position before they robbed the country.
[02:16:14.106 --> 02:16:16.709]  This has been a long-term strategic plan.
[02:16:16.709 --> 02:16:20.692]  And of course they were profiting the whole time, taking over the infrastructure while they did it.
[02:16:20.692 --> 02:16:21.793]  I mean, this is diabolical.
[02:16:22.972 --> 02:16:33.535]  Well, the idea of spying and spies, going back a few decades, it usually gets back to corporations seeking intelligence on other corporations.
[02:16:33.535 --> 02:16:47.379]  And this is really the CIA and these organizations that came out of World War II and a lot of the corporate work that was done in World War II transformed into this intelligent network of corporate espionage.
[02:16:47.379 --> 02:16:48.679]  And it's an unfair trade advantage.
[02:16:49.967 --> 02:17:09.083]  Yeah, but today, because of the economy collapsing, what we're seeing is something different, a little different, in that folks who want to run the global game are trying to come up with new ways to, let's say, replace the current
[02:17:09.879 --> 02:17:10.741]  I'm good.
[02:17:26.301 --> 02:17:28.984]  Or a Facebook or a social networking site.
[02:17:28.984 --> 02:17:35.029]  You know, this is a theme I've explored with you before on your show, that currency is being replaced with credits and debits.
[02:17:35.029 --> 02:17:41.935]  And if you go to AlexJonesInfoWars.com, you will find your online account filled with debits.
[02:17:41.935 --> 02:17:48.881]  But if you go to GoldmanSachsPropaganda.com, you find your online account filled with credits.
[02:17:49.469 --> 02:17:55.934]  And this is a new virtual currency that's coming online and it's already a multi-billion dollar industry.
[02:17:55.934 --> 02:18:03.320]  A company called Zynga, which makes the virtual currency for online games, is already a multi-billion dollar industry.
[02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:10.406]  People swapping their time for virtual credit and effectively working for 30 or 40 cents a day.
[02:18:10.406 --> 02:18:13.388]  And they're happy to do it because they think they're winning something.
[02:18:13.388 --> 02:18:16.731]  And it's the combination of these online social networks
[02:18:17.191 --> 02:18:25.735]  The banking system looking for a new form of virtual currency and the casino industry and all their technology to get people to gamble away their lives have come together.
[02:18:25.735 --> 02:18:27.575]  And so this is part of what we're seeing also.
[02:18:27.575 --> 02:18:35.639]  They need all this intelligence gathering in order to create this incredible new society of people who are basically just
[02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:40.946]  On the web, but only in ways that are approved by the Googles of the world.
[02:18:40.946 --> 02:18:41.426]  That's right.
[02:18:41.426 --> 02:18:42.228]  Now stop there.
[02:18:42.228 --> 02:18:44.851]  Stop there because this is so key.
[02:18:44.851 --> 02:18:51.760]  If you read George Orwell's 1984, and of course he worked for British Intelligence at BBC and Black Ops, his character is Winston Smith.
[02:18:53.123 --> 02:18:56.425]  He said the public won't rise up because of the lottery.
[02:18:56.425 --> 02:19:12.012]  And he talks about how people believing they have a chance to win within that fake paradigm is why they would never rise up because they've been trained to only care about issues of little or no significance and fake pop icons that Big Brother produced and pornography.
[02:19:12.012 --> 02:19:15.354]  And that's because they understood psychology 50-something years ago when he wrote that in 48.
[02:19:16.534 --> 02:19:28.119]  Now, we see the high-tech version of this, where everything is about that chance to win, and, oh, I better not get out of the Federal Reserve System, because then I'll get none of my retirement, when you're not going to get it to begin with.
[02:19:28.843 --> 02:19:31.685]  Right, you lose all of your chances to win at the lottery.
[02:19:31.685 --> 02:19:35.388]  So dollar bills are replaced with virtual lottery tickets.
[02:19:35.388 --> 02:19:49.620]  And people will be happy to spend hours their entire lives clicking away online for more of these virtual lottery tickets in the hopes that someday they too will graduate to the higher level in the game.
[02:19:49.620 --> 02:19:52.422]  Stay there Max, this is so profound what you just talked about.
[02:19:54.332 --> 02:20:01.296]  They create a false reality of sports, movies, icons, fake credits, and you sell your soul for it.
[02:20:01.296 --> 02:20:05.679]  If the cost of your prescriptions are getting out of control, you want to listen carefully to this.

[02:21:01.868 --> 02:21:05.751]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[02:21:05.751 --> 02:21:07.153]  dollar has been devaluating.
[02:21:07.153 --> 02:21:11.036]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[02:21:11.036 --> 02:21:13.959]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[02:21:13.959 --> 02:21:16.021]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[02:21:16.021 --> 02:21:18.323]  They've both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[02:21:19.364 --> 02:21:25.006]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[02:21:25.006 --> 02:21:27.447]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[02:21:35.049 --> 02:21:37.130]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[02:21:37.130 --> 02:21:39.692]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.

[02:21:42.674 --> 02:21:43.395]  Call 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[02:21:43.395 --> 02:21:46.116]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[02:21:46.116 --> 02:21:46.777]  That's 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[02:22:00.970 --> 02:22:05.934]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:22:05.934 --> 02:22:06.914]  What have we got?
[02:22:06.914 --> 02:22:09.376]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:22:09.376 --> 02:22:10.377]  A republic.
[02:22:10.377 --> 02:22:13.039]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:22:13.039 --> 02:22:15.301]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:22:15.301 --> 02:22:17.322]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:22:17.322 --> 02:22:19.003]  So they think they own our land?
[02:22:19.003 --> 02:22:20.324]  They think they own our water?
[02:22:20.324 --> 02:22:20.925]  Children?
[02:22:20.925 --> 02:22:22.046]  Our education?
[02:22:22.046 --> 02:22:22.886]  Our money?
[02:22:22.886 --> 02:22:26.529]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:22:26.889 --> 02:22:30.594]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:22:30.594 --> 02:22:31.856]  You are being warned.
[02:22:31.856 --> 02:22:32.877]  We have the facts.
[02:22:32.877 --> 02:22:34.059]  We have the Constitution.
[02:22:34.059 --> 02:22:34.960]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:22:34.960 --> 02:22:35.841]  We have common law.
[02:22:35.841 --> 02:22:38.365]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:38.365 --> 02:22:42.150]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:22:42.250 --> 02:22:47.191]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:22:47.191 --> 02:22:48.692]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:22:48.692 --> 02:22:49.792]  Don't tread on me.
[02:22:49.792 --> 02:22:56.654]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:23:03.066 --> 02:23:04.286]  This is not a drill.
[02:23:04.286 --> 02:23:06.807]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[02:23:06.807 --> 02:23:08.708]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[02:23:08.708 --> 02:23:15.910]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[02:23:15.910 --> 02:23:20.311]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[02:23:20.311 --> 02:23:30.594]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[02:23:30.814 --> 02:23:32.454]  Under any circumstance.
[02:23:32.454 --> 02:23:39.676]  These and other closely guarded gun cashing secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[02:23:39.676 --> 02:23:40.337]  But listen up.
[02:23:40.337 --> 02:23:46.598]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[02:23:46.598 --> 02:23:48.459]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[02:23:48.459 --> 02:23:50.620]  That's hideyourguns.com.
[02:23:50.620 --> 02:23:51.100]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[02:23:51.100 --> 02:23:53.000]  Before they come for your guns.
[02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:53.600]  Hideyourguns.com.
[02:23:53.600 --> 02:23:54.181]  Right now.
[02:24:04.210 --> 02:24:06.552]  Ladies and gentlemen, huge breaking news.
[02:24:06.552 --> 02:24:08.094]  Wal-Mart's Kaiser is with us.
[02:24:08.094 --> 02:24:09.495]  Huge breaking news.
[02:24:09.495 --> 02:24:17.623]  We're seeing a 21st century example of information war going on with the NSA, RUN, Google, and YouTube.
[02:24:19.289 --> 02:24:21.611]  It has been the number one video.
[02:24:21.611 --> 02:24:24.933]  This particular version was 6.5 million views, got about 100,000 a day.
[02:24:24.933 --> 02:24:27.635]  They hacked into our account, they took it down.
[02:24:27.635 --> 02:24:29.437]  I've said I believe it's an inside job.
[02:24:29.437 --> 02:24:31.878]  We changed the passcodes again.
[02:24:31.878 --> 02:24:39.704]  They have now disabled it all over the web if it's embedded on somebody else's webpage or the articles we've written.
[02:24:39.704 --> 02:24:40.845]  And it says, disabled by user.
[02:24:44.505 --> 02:24:45.185]  Disabled.
[02:24:45.185 --> 02:24:48.327]  It says it's been disabled that you have to go to YouTube to watch it.
[02:24:48.327 --> 02:24:50.267]  Now, go back to the other screen.
[02:24:50.267 --> 02:24:58.391]  When you go to YouTube, it says, renting on YouTube starts with YouTube account.
[02:24:58.391 --> 02:25:03.673]  It is $2.95 to rent it.
[02:25:03.673 --> 02:25:05.794]  Ladies and gentlemen, we give the film out for free!
[02:25:07.352 --> 02:25:12.576]  When they enable this, I've read the rules, they will go and erase all the other copies claiming that we've agreed.
[02:25:12.576 --> 02:25:14.918]  This is sabotage.
[02:25:14.918 --> 02:25:17.520]  This is happening live time.
[02:25:17.520 --> 02:25:19.582]  It is going mega viral on the web.
[02:25:19.582 --> 02:25:23.045]  The Obama deception and our story Google Spies.
[02:25:23.045 --> 02:25:27.549]  And so now they're making you pay money to them for my film.
[02:25:28.695 --> 02:25:33.457]  My film, and they want to... I told you I had a feeling they were going to strike back.
[02:25:33.457 --> 02:25:36.618]  I knew there was something chicanery going on here.
[02:25:36.618 --> 02:25:39.259]  Google never, when they bring a video down, put it back up.
[02:25:39.259 --> 02:25:41.399]  This is unprecedented.
[02:25:41.399 --> 02:25:47.441]  Max Keiser, Max Keiser, this is exactly what you're talking about, how they use everybody's content and make you pay for it.
[02:25:47.441 --> 02:25:49.482]  This is insane, Max.
[02:25:49.482 --> 02:25:51.863]  Now... You own the copyright, right?
[02:25:52.697 --> 02:25:53.838]  Yes!
[02:25:53.838 --> 02:25:55.978]  Okay, so they're violating copyright law.
[02:25:55.978 --> 02:25:57.439]  They should take him to court immediately.
[02:25:57.439 --> 02:26:04.202]  Well, these are people that say they own every book in the world and they're going to publish it now online and charge and give no one money.
[02:26:04.202 --> 02:26:05.383]  Because it's the government.
[02:26:05.383 --> 02:26:06.303]  They know.
[02:26:06.303 --> 02:26:08.024]  Other corporations don't get away with this.
[02:26:08.024 --> 02:26:10.645]  There's a reason they let YouTube and Google be the biggest.
[02:26:10.645 --> 02:26:13.126]  And again, we're on there because that's where the fight's happening.
[02:26:13.126 --> 02:26:14.987]  I can't believe this!
[02:26:14.987 --> 02:26:19.609]  All right, okay, go to, if you do, search Video Game CEO Chairs Digital Tyranny.
[02:26:20.239 --> 02:26:22.421]  Let me read you this little bit.
[02:26:22.421 --> 02:26:38.898]  He says, as more power is taken from the hands of ordinary people, and they find themselves working harder and harder for fewer and fewer real rewards, they're seeking escape and a sense of personal achievement by building make-believe farms and creating pretend empires through fake mafia families.
[02:26:39.418 --> 02:26:52.005]  Because, similar to our Federal Reserve note, the objects obtained from these games are made out of thin air, but without any need for physical resources to create them, there's no scarcity of reward to be handed out.
[02:26:52.005 --> 02:27:00.610]  People pay real money, real defined as credit obtained from labor in the real world, for the chance to one-up their friends in what is ultimately just a game.
[02:27:01.190 --> 02:27:13.995]  Now, as the games are just the beginning, the future, the outlines will bring the structure of these games into the real world where our lives will be controlled by a similar point system to replace our currency.
[02:27:13.995 --> 02:27:16.836]  He speaks of the potential for a government awarding credits.
[02:27:18.490 --> 02:27:29.857]  So it's total social control through the web and then it's a controlled web.
[02:27:29.857 --> 02:27:31.658]  You talked about this five years ago.
[02:27:31.658 --> 02:27:34.760]  It's a casino gulag.
[02:27:34.760 --> 02:27:41.625]  But can you believe that first they go in, clearly YouTube, they've got our account number, and now we change the passcode
[02:27:42.305 --> 02:27:43.846]  They're the only ones that have it.
[02:27:43.846 --> 02:27:45.386]  Nobody could hack it in this time.
[02:27:45.386 --> 02:27:56.091]  And they go in and disable all the millions of links around the web where other news websites and people have posted it, so it's going mega-viral, and their new sabotage is to make it a rental!
[02:27:56.091 --> 02:27:59.212]  I mean, my... I cannot believe this, man!
[02:27:59.212 --> 02:28:00.713]  Folks, do not pay for it.
[02:28:00.713 --> 02:28:02.394]  Do not give them a red, stinking scent.
[02:28:02.394 --> 02:28:05.575]  It's still free, and a lot of other news websites and places.
[02:28:05.575 --> 02:28:08.817]  But send the links to ones that are working out to everyone you know.
[02:28:09.637 --> 02:28:11.678]  I'll tell you, Max, they are scared of this film.
[02:28:11.678 --> 02:28:13.899]  You're in Fall of the Republic Part 2 of the Obama Deception.
[02:28:13.899 --> 02:28:15.420]  I think it's even more important.
[02:28:15.420 --> 02:28:17.440]  But, I mean, you've seen the Obama Deception.
[02:28:17.440 --> 02:28:19.641]  Why do you think they're so scared of it?
[02:28:19.641 --> 02:28:24.563]  Well, first of all, change the name of Fall of the Republic to the Obama Deception Part 2.
[02:28:24.563 --> 02:28:25.784]  That'll totally screw up their head.
[02:28:28.089 --> 02:28:31.190]  Then they're going to have to go chase after another 10 million videos out there.
[02:28:31.190 --> 02:28:34.970]  In other words, information overload with information overload.
[02:28:34.970 --> 02:28:39.291]  You know, what is it about the word war, info war, that people don't understand?
[02:28:39.291 --> 02:28:40.291]  It's a war.
[02:28:40.291 --> 02:28:41.571]  It's an info war.
[02:28:41.571 --> 02:28:44.192]  So we've got to fight back with information.
[02:28:44.192 --> 02:28:47.332]  So just change everything to call it the Obama deception.
[02:28:47.332 --> 02:28:49.793]  Change your name on Facebook to the Obama deception.
[02:28:49.793 --> 02:28:52.733]  Change everything on your digital profile to the Obama deception.
[02:28:52.733 --> 02:28:54.534]  They can't kill it all.
[02:28:54.534 --> 02:28:55.514]  And they're panicking!
[02:28:56.814 --> 02:28:58.136]  And they're panicking right now.
[02:28:58.136 --> 02:29:00.198]  It's been the number one search term for three days.
[02:29:00.198 --> 02:29:08.927]  People keep varying it, like the Obama deception at InfoWars, the Obama deception censored, and they keep censoring that, but not before it hits number one.
[02:29:08.927 --> 02:29:10.288]  They are in panic mode.
[02:29:10.288 --> 02:29:14.733]  I think we're seeing a digital revolt right now, Max, and people go completely ape right now.
[02:29:15.819 --> 02:29:19.823]  Well, a few years ago, remember, China and America had a digital war.
[02:29:19.823 --> 02:29:23.608]  They had a distributed denial-of-service attack that China hit the U.S.
[02:29:23.608 --> 02:29:24.629]  with, and then the U.S.
[02:29:24.629 --> 02:29:28.673]  hit with a downing of some kind of surveillance technology.
[02:29:28.673 --> 02:29:31.256]  So now you've become, effectively, your own country.
[02:29:31.256 --> 02:29:34.399]  Theinfowar.com has become as big as a country.
[02:29:34.940 --> 02:29:36.221]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[02:31:04.433 --> 02:31:05.695]  Tyranny is here.
[02:31:05.695 --> 02:31:09.582]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:31:09.582 --> 02:31:11.865]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:31:11.865 --> 02:31:17.274]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:31:17.714 --> 02:31:24.384]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:31:24.384 --> 02:31:30.372]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:31:30.372 --> 02:31:34.058]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:31:34.538 --> 02:31:38.842]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.

[02:31:44.787 --> 02:31:48.331]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:31:48.331 --> 02:31:50.312]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:31:50.312 --> 02:31:51.453]  It's here.

[02:32:04.317 --> 02:32:10.741]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:32:10.741 --> 02:32:18.127]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:32:18.127 --> 02:32:22.670]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[02:32:22.990 --> 02:32:31.656]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[02:32:31.656 --> 02:32:35.899]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[02:32:35.899 --> 02:32:41.623]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:32:42.663 --> 02:32:46.567]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:32:46.567 --> 02:32:53.994]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[02:32:53.994 --> 02:32:54.454]  Thank you.
[02:33:12.310 --> 02:33:15.954]  You can run on for a long time.
[02:33:15.954 --> 02:33:18.896]  Run on for a long time.
[02:33:18.896 --> 02:33:22.139]  Run on for a long time.
[02:33:22.139 --> 02:33:24.722]  All right, we're going into overdrive into the fourth hour.
[02:33:24.722 --> 02:33:26.423]  It'll be on the network and the satellites.
[02:33:26.423 --> 02:33:28.545]  Max Keiser's gonna stay with us.
[02:33:28.545 --> 02:33:31.568]  In his words during the break, he said, I'm not leaving my post.
[02:33:31.568 --> 02:33:35.012]  They've also disabled police state for the rise of FEMA.
[02:33:36.087 --> 02:33:39.611]  They've also disabled that on all of the search engines.
[02:33:39.611 --> 02:33:42.754]  When you click on it, it tells you you've got to go to YouTube to watch it.
[02:33:42.754 --> 02:33:51.124]  They're trying to charge people money when we give this film out for free as a way to keep people from watching it.
[02:33:51.124 --> 02:33:52.305]  This is outrageous!
[02:33:53.362 --> 02:33:56.963]  Ladies and gentlemen, don't give YouTube or Google any money.
[02:33:56.963 --> 02:33:57.944]  Do not pay to watch it.
[02:33:57.944 --> 02:33:59.484]  They're still free versions.
[02:33:59.484 --> 02:34:06.707]  But once they do this, I've read about this, they're going to try to knock out all the other free versions that are out there, and then they'll shut down this version.
[02:34:06.707 --> 02:34:08.407]  We can now see their plan.
[02:34:08.407 --> 02:34:10.568]  They do not want you to see the Obama deception.
[02:34:10.568 --> 02:34:19.631]  For a limited time, until they run out, I've got the Obama deception, four copies for $19.95, and the hardcover DVD with the expanded extras in the highest quality.
[02:34:19.631 --> 02:34:22.412]  Get it, make physical copies, and hand them out on the street.
[02:34:23.112 --> 02:34:26.355]  But you can really see how they get everything hooked into Google and YouTube.
[02:34:26.355 --> 02:34:28.096]  It's really an NSA front.
[02:34:28.096 --> 02:34:29.437]  It takes over the web.
[02:34:29.437 --> 02:34:30.819]  It publishes books.
[02:34:30.819 --> 02:34:33.361]  Doesn't care if publishers sue them.
[02:34:33.361 --> 02:34:35.262]  The courts always rule for Google.
[02:34:35.262 --> 02:34:38.926]  They are allowed to do things that nobody else is ever allowed to do.
[02:34:38.926 --> 02:34:40.547]  And you can see the strategic plan.
[02:34:40.547 --> 02:34:43.349]  I saw this years ago, but now it's very clear.
[02:34:43.349 --> 02:34:45.151]  They are meant to absorb the web.
[02:34:45.151 --> 02:34:48.514]  In fact, that's come out in major news headlines that Google is to be the web.
[02:34:50.422 --> 02:34:54.483]  And it is a Pentagon operation with these select corporations.
[02:34:54.483 --> 02:35:02.804]  It is NSA keyword software that Google was built on 11 years ago when it first launched out of nowhere.
[02:35:02.804 --> 02:35:05.065]  It is using NSA keyword software.
[02:35:05.065 --> 02:35:07.085]  That's its base search function.
[02:35:07.085 --> 02:35:17.227]  And it's to understand society, it's to track us, it's to go out and wage cyber war, and that's why our headline, Google Spies
[02:35:18.047 --> 02:35:21.729]  is so key to make that the number one search term so that people understand this.
[02:35:21.729 --> 02:35:25.951]  And I'll have Steve Watson, let's call him, update the fact that they're now trying to charge people for it.
[02:35:25.951 --> 02:35:27.532]  And this is not us.
[02:35:27.532 --> 02:35:30.914]  If you want to support us, buy the DVDs at Infowars.com.
[02:35:30.914 --> 02:35:32.575]  You can get ten of them for $39.95.
[02:35:32.575 --> 02:35:35.997]  That's about four bucks a piece.
[02:35:35.997 --> 02:35:40.679]  You can get four of them for $19.95 at Infowars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:35:44.181 --> 02:35:45.862]  We're going into overdrive in the next hour.
[02:35:45.862 --> 02:35:49.345]  We'll be live, it'll be on the network, the stations, all of it.
[02:35:49.345 --> 02:35:52.727]  But right now we're talking to Max Keiser, then we're going to start going to your phone calls.
[02:35:52.727 --> 02:35:58.071]  I want to get into some other financial news, but Max has agreed to stay with us 30 minutes to the next hour.
[02:35:58.071 --> 02:35:59.412]  Max, this is insane!
[02:35:59.412 --> 02:36:03.394]  I mean, what's your breakdown of what we see happening?
[02:36:03.394 --> 02:36:12.601]  Well, first of all, I just want to point out that the Max Keiser YouTube channel on YouTube has a very paltry 10,000 subscribers.
[02:36:13.502 --> 02:36:28.245]  The next time I come on your show, Alex, if that number's out of 20,000, I'm going to recite the entire Obama deception in Sanskrit for a captive audience and make them listen to me do it.
[02:36:28.245 --> 02:36:29.806]  I mean, this is pitiful.
[02:36:29.806 --> 02:36:31.606]  I only have 10,000 subscribers.
[02:36:31.606 --> 02:36:34.567]  There's got to be at least 20,000 subscribers.
[02:36:34.567 --> 02:36:36.387]  But anyway, let's continue talking about the financial news.
[02:36:36.767 --> 02:36:45.597]  Well, no, going back to this Obama situation, I don't think people realize how big this is and that we're literally battling with YouTube and Google in real time.
[02:36:45.597 --> 02:36:48.720]  How arrogant are they to take it down, then put it back up?
[02:36:48.720 --> 02:36:50.322]  And I said, I smell a rat.
[02:36:50.322 --> 02:36:51.583]  I think they're going to counterstrike.
[02:36:51.583 --> 02:36:55.387]  And their way of doing it is to disable it all over the web, except for YouTube.
[02:36:55.387 --> 02:36:57.029]  And then you go there and they want money.
[02:36:58.137 --> 02:37:06.007]  Well, I think what we're seeing also is an interplay between how computers are programmed to do different things.
[02:37:06.007 --> 02:37:15.220]  And I think that certainly on Wall Street, the computers are programmed, it's called program trading, and they can program computers to do all kinds of market manipulation.
[02:37:15.880 --> 02:37:19.262]  And this is how most of Wall Street makes their money these days.
[02:37:19.262 --> 02:37:21.682]  They simply program computers to steal.
[02:37:21.682 --> 02:37:23.303]  And this is exactly what they do.
[02:37:23.303 --> 02:37:31.126]  But computers are also programmed to sniff out, like you say, that the Obama deception is rising quickly on the trend list.
[02:37:31.126 --> 02:37:34.628]  In fact, it was trending higher than it had been recently.
[02:37:34.628 --> 02:37:42.351]  Well, the computers see that, and they make the calculations, and they see that the words associated with Obama and then the deception is untenable.
[02:37:42.791 --> 02:37:50.914]  So then the computers simply kick in and start to delete videos or change videos, and they figure they can always mop up the legal mess later.
[02:37:50.914 --> 02:37:52.934]  But the computers have dominion.
[02:37:52.934 --> 02:37:54.655]  The computers run the show.
[02:37:54.655 --> 02:37:57.616]  They will change the programming tomorrow or the next day.
[02:37:57.616 --> 02:38:01.757]  And what we see today is that they're trying to catch up with what's going on in your situation.
[02:38:01.757 --> 02:38:09.820]  You've basically broken the computers for today, just like when you flood a website with too much traffic, it goes crazy and they can't catch up to it.
[02:38:09.940 --> 02:38:11.442]  They will learn more next time.
[02:38:11.442 --> 02:38:13.163]  We've got to learn more next time.
[02:38:13.163 --> 02:38:18.289]  This is humans interfacing with machines to battle the artificial intelligence of the NSA.
[02:38:18.993 --> 02:38:23.096]  Well, it's InfoWars, and so you are winning a battle here.
[02:38:23.096 --> 02:38:44.471]  You're winning a battle in the InfoWars, and I think that to build on the success, there's got to be more strategies and more tactics based on the fact that the current propaganda wars are made entirely of information, and as this report called Top Secret America points out, the military-industrial complex doesn't really care so much about the
[02:38:44.551 --> 02:38:44.851]  I think so.
[02:39:03.281 --> 02:39:06.002]  I mean, I see you referenced on Drudge Report all the time.
[02:39:06.002 --> 02:39:14.306]  I even see you talked about on Huffington Post, which is, you know, perceptibly on the other side of the political aisle.
[02:39:14.306 --> 02:39:16.587]  But you're becoming a force to be reckoned with.
[02:39:16.587 --> 02:39:25.772]  So the computers have isolated you and are trying to combat you with algorithms and programs to try to over...
[02:39:26.727 --> 02:39:31.270]  Over, over, over, over-read you, over-write you with additional information.
[02:39:31.270 --> 02:39:32.170]  And we see the same thing.
[02:39:32.170 --> 02:39:35.712]  It's very interesting because we see the exact same thing on Wall Street.
[02:39:35.712 --> 02:39:39.254]  The flash crash of May 6th, the 1,000-point drop.
[02:39:39.254 --> 02:39:40.775]  That was a computer glitch.
[02:39:40.775 --> 02:39:45.938]  You know, the computers were programmed to steal money slowly, not in 1,000-point grabs.
[02:39:45.938 --> 02:39:49.240]  You know, when I was working on Wall Street, we had a saying that went like this.
[02:39:49.240 --> 02:39:51.942]  We used to say, sheer, don't slaughter.
[02:39:52.583 --> 02:40:02.091]  And what that means is, you take a little bit from your clients every single day, but don't kill your clients, because you want to keep them alive long enough to shear them the next day.
[02:40:02.091 --> 02:40:05.473]  And this is exactly the way... Alright, we're going to talk about that more in a moment.
[02:40:05.473 --> 02:40:09.616]  Max is going to be with us into the next hour, but Kenneth Webb runs the Director Channel.
[02:40:09.616 --> 02:40:10.297]  People get confused.
[02:40:10.297 --> 02:40:15.001]  He's not the director of the Obama Deception, though he's directed his own great films, like Debunk This.
[02:40:16.383 --> 02:40:20.287]  But he's a guy who has an account that can upload more than 10 minute chunks.
[02:40:20.287 --> 02:40:24.532]  So he uploaded the number one version of the Obama deception back in March of last year.
[02:40:24.532 --> 02:40:26.794]  It's had 6.5 million views.
[02:40:26.794 --> 02:40:28.857]  It was surging and growing even faster.
[02:40:28.857 --> 02:40:30.879]  It was somebody hacked and deleted it.
[02:40:30.879 --> 02:40:33.001]  And he's, I guess, out on the road because his cell phone's cutting out.
[02:40:36.645 --> 02:40:44.771]  They are in there now, inside, making people pay to see the Obama deception on all our computers in the office.
[02:40:44.771 --> 02:40:46.292]  This is outrageous.
[02:40:46.292 --> 02:40:52.856]  You haven't implemented that, because I haven't talked to you yet, but I know Google has to offer that, and we're not asking for it.
[02:40:52.856 --> 02:40:55.218]  So, I mean, this is amazing.
[02:40:55.218 --> 02:40:57.199]  Yeah, it was, actually, how's it going, Alex?
[02:40:58.869 --> 02:40:59.709]  I was just starting.
[02:40:59.709 --> 02:41:04.810]  I've seen some people from the UK saying that they weren't able to access the video.
[02:41:04.810 --> 02:41:09.572]  So I went in to see what the problem was.
[02:41:09.572 --> 02:41:15.913]  It had some kind of rental thing on all, specifically all three of those videos that were taken down.
[02:41:15.913 --> 02:41:17.934]  They were all for rent.
[02:41:17.934 --> 02:41:21.314]  And, you know, it wasn't like that, you know, an hour ago.
[02:41:21.314 --> 02:41:23.635]  And then all of a sudden, it's like that.
[02:41:23.635 --> 02:41:25.195]  I don't know.
[02:41:25.195 --> 02:41:28.076]  It's kind of crazy and mind-boggling because
[02:41:28.712 --> 02:41:36.957]  They, you know, when they reinstated those three videos, they reinstated videos that have been down for years now.
[02:41:36.957 --> 02:41:38.338]  The ones they took down.
[02:41:39.031 --> 02:41:49.916]  Um, the first few videos they took down that I actually put up were from Military.com and they, you know, they said, you know, copyright infringement, they took it down and everything and those were back up.
[02:41:49.916 --> 02:41:51.597]  So I had to go through all the videos.
[02:41:51.597 --> 02:41:58.260]  I was about, and then I called you this morning and I said, I believe that's a false flag by putting videos up to get more strikes against your account.
[02:41:58.820 --> 02:42:14.231]  And now they've thrown this pay thing on it, and the thousands of sites, and that's conservative, that it's linked to around the web, where people embed the video to Obama deception, police aid for the rise of FEMA in your film, debunk this, which is about government-sponsored terror and fluoride and other issues.
[02:42:14.231 --> 02:42:16.292]  Now they're trying to make you pay for those.
[02:42:16.292 --> 02:42:20.315]  This is... I guess you've got to turn Google Ads off.
[02:42:20.315 --> 02:42:22.536]  I think that's how they're able to claim they can do this.
[02:42:22.536 --> 02:42:23.437]  Can you turn that off?
[02:42:24.278 --> 02:42:25.119]  Oh, yeah.
[02:42:25.119 --> 02:42:26.259]  I could turn that off.
[02:42:26.259 --> 02:42:32.043]  Actually, when I went in, they had added the whole rentable button and this whole slew of stuff.
[02:42:32.043 --> 02:42:36.386]  When they reinstated all these videos, they put all this new stuff up.
[02:42:36.386 --> 02:42:38.788]  I don't even know where that came from.
[02:42:38.788 --> 02:42:48.654]  And, you know, I went through and I found the rentable part where it says rentable videos, which is new to me, and I disabled them.
[02:42:48.654 --> 02:42:52.557]  And then what it did, it took all of those videos and it made them private.
[02:42:53.348 --> 02:43:01.012]  So I had to go back in to the actual video and edit that and make them not private anymore for everybody.
[02:43:01.012 --> 02:43:02.373]  And they're back up now.
[02:43:02.373 --> 02:43:03.093]  Oh, definitely.
[02:43:03.093 --> 02:43:03.514]  Definitely.
[02:43:03.514 --> 02:43:04.434]  Already done, Alex.
[02:43:04.434 --> 02:43:04.874]  Already done.
[02:43:18.763 --> 02:43:20.164]  Well, don't lose that passcode.
[02:43:20.164 --> 02:43:22.066]  My God, this is getting insane.
[02:43:22.066 --> 02:43:22.807]  Stay there, Kenneth.
[02:43:22.807 --> 02:43:25.489]  Well, Max Keiser's in the wings.
[02:43:25.489 --> 02:43:29.893]  Now we've got more intel from the man that runs the channel, Kenneth Webb.
[02:43:29.893 --> 02:43:37.920]  This does sound like an automatic computer system, or that somebody's using those systems to keep us from being all over the web.
[02:43:37.920 --> 02:43:39.021]  Max Keiser, what's your take?
[02:43:39.790 --> 02:43:42.411]  Well, you know, you're heading into the November election.
[02:43:42.411 --> 02:43:51.515]  The Obama team is nervous because their programs have been a failure for the very reason that you talk about in your film, the Obama deception.
[02:43:51.515 --> 02:43:59.338]  And so a simple conversation with the webmasters at Google tried to do what you can to shape
[02:44:00.060 --> 02:44:00.460]  We're good.
[02:44:14.654 --> 02:44:29.094]  Let me ask you this question, Max, because I mean Max invented the Hollywood Stock Exchange system that they admittedly use in many modern stock exchange computer systems now.
[02:44:30.894 --> 02:44:40.825]  Looking at this, do you think Obama and his people like the fact that when you typed his name in in the last month, the top link was this link to this particular version of the Obama deception?
[02:44:40.825 --> 02:44:48.574]  There's no way going into an election that they wanted when somebody searched the name Obama, in any variation, it was my film.
[02:44:48.574 --> 02:44:50.957]  I mean, clearly they have shown their hand by doing this.
[02:44:52.472 --> 02:45:02.763]  Because the attention span of the average American is so short that even just the one second connection of Obama with the word deception
[02:45:03.664 --> 02:45:04.745]  Is a problem.
[02:45:04.745 --> 02:45:10.150]  Because people in their subconscious mind equate Obama with deception.
[02:45:10.150 --> 02:45:14.174]  And that this is a huge result of searching Obama and you get deception.
[02:45:14.174 --> 02:45:20.540]  Whether you even consciously admit it or not or recognize it when you go to the voting booth, you equate Obama with deception.
[02:45:20.540 --> 02:45:23.463]  This is all part of the propaganda that was invented
[02:45:23.963 --> 02:45:35.109]  By, you know, the National Socialists of Germany and then picked up by the Brandeis in this country when they started the public relations firms back after World War II.
[02:45:35.109 --> 02:45:41.312]  And this is what's used and understood is that it's the Freudian psychology that unconsciously people...
[02:45:41.812 --> 02:45:44.394]  I didn't name it that out of manipulation.
[02:45:44.394 --> 02:45:51.619]  I just try to tell the truth and I know he's deceiving and I know that Obama is a front and himself is a deception.
[02:45:51.619 --> 02:46:03.127]  You know the whole persona of Obama is a manufactured Madison Avenue system and so if you just organically tell the truth it trumps all their lies and spin and manipulation.
[02:46:03.127 --> 02:46:04.147]  Let's go back to Kenneth Webb.
[02:46:05.548 --> 02:46:06.909]  And then come back to you, Kizer.
[02:46:06.909 --> 02:46:12.473]  Kenneth, I mean, what was it like for you to find out Saturday that they had taken this video down?
[02:46:12.473 --> 02:46:13.434]  It was horrible.
[02:46:13.434 --> 02:46:14.615]  It was horrible.
[02:46:14.615 --> 02:46:18.017]  I really got sick at the stomach.
[02:46:18.017 --> 02:46:27.784]  You know, my mom, you know, pretty, pretty simple said that, you know, if, if, if this is happening, that means you're actually, you know, that you guys are really doing something.
[02:46:28.345 --> 02:46:34.901]  So there was a good side to it and I had to focus on that and then trying to get it back up and everything.
[02:46:37.203 --> 02:46:40.586]  I know we're stomping on some toes, there's no doubt about it.
[02:46:40.586 --> 02:46:44.409]  You know, they've hacked my website, spywitnessnews.org.
[02:46:44.409 --> 02:46:47.111]  We've had problems with these videos.
[02:46:47.111 --> 02:46:56.778]  A couple of times we've had people actually hack the YouTube page for Obama Deception, putting all kinds of code in that was having an effect on the page.
[02:46:56.778 --> 02:46:59.780]  That happened for like a day, probably about a month ago.
[02:47:01.958 --> 02:47:03.239]  It's just crazy.
[02:47:03.239 --> 02:47:10.441]  It's crazy, but like I said, I believe that we're really having an effect, else why would they even mess around with anything like this?
[02:47:10.441 --> 02:47:16.783]  I mean, even if it's small-time hackers or big-time hackers, they're definitely feeling it.
[02:47:17.452 --> 02:47:21.836]  Yeah, but small-time hackers can't shut it down all over the web and make people pay for it.
[02:47:21.836 --> 02:47:27.360]  Only Google and YouTube can do it, and I say they're the number one prime suspects in all of this.
[02:47:27.360 --> 02:47:30.743]  But notice, if we would have just laid down to this, they would have won.
[02:47:30.743 --> 02:47:32.004]  But by fighting back,
[02:47:33.075 --> 02:47:38.061]  Now we have an even bigger victory and we show people these crooks aren't invincible.
[02:47:38.061 --> 02:47:41.024]  And so now it's an even bigger disaster for them.
[02:47:41.024 --> 02:47:44.689]  And this is, I mean, this is the biggest thing we've ever done.
[02:47:44.689 --> 02:47:51.497]  Our response to this, our resistance to them, the idea to promote the Obama deception last week, this has turned into the biggest event.
[02:47:51.977 --> 02:47:55.539]  Of anything I've ever done and it's only growing faster.
[02:48:22.337 --> 02:48:30.582]  Well, if everybody has a blog, embed in the header of their blog, Obama equals deception, then you're fighting the info wars.
[02:48:30.582 --> 02:48:40.028]  You don't even have to link to the film, or you can just have that link in the heading of your blog, so that the search engines will equate Obama with deception.
[02:48:40.028 --> 02:48:47.253]  Remember, Obama won because if you did a search in 2008 for the word hope, you would get results, Obama, Barack Obama.
[02:48:47.253 --> 02:48:49.054]  And that's why he's the President of the United States.
[02:48:49.054 --> 02:48:50.735]  He essentially commandeered the word hope.
[02:48:51.485 --> 02:48:54.867]  Okay, now you've equated Obama with deception.
[02:48:54.867 --> 02:48:56.628]  Let's keep pushing that theme.
[02:48:56.628 --> 02:49:04.774]  If you keep pushing that theme and you institute a major political overturn in the next six to seven months, you will have accomplished a major battle in the infowars.
[02:49:05.322 --> 02:49:08.044]  And I guess they're propagandist and they recognize this.
[02:49:08.044 --> 02:49:12.868]  I mean, Max, I'm just a regular guy who just swings with the truth and I guess it trumps them over and over again.
[02:49:12.868 --> 02:49:16.591]  But the more I think about it, it was the top link, Obama deception.
[02:49:16.591 --> 02:49:17.471]  They don't like that.
[02:49:17.471 --> 02:49:19.493]  This was, this is, this is important.
[02:49:19.493 --> 02:49:23.096]  They wouldn't have censored this and revealed themselves unless they knew it was important.
[02:49:23.635 --> 02:49:27.237]  But what is it Washington Post just released today in Top Secret America?
[02:49:27.237 --> 02:49:39.222]  There's 800,000 people in its fourth branch of government in the United States who are fighting the Infowars, who have allegiances with the information technology firms in America, including Google.
[02:49:39.822 --> 02:49:43.224]  And this is now out in the Washington Post.
[02:49:43.224 --> 02:49:45.266]  This is now... The war is on.
[02:49:45.266 --> 02:49:46.827]  The battle lines have been drawn.
[02:49:46.827 --> 02:49:48.108]  The tyranny is here.
[02:50:10.143 --> 02:50:12.265]  And Dave, who runs it, hadn't even told me that.
[02:50:12.265 --> 02:50:15.068]  When I called him Saturday, he said, yeah, they're trying it here too.
[02:50:15.068 --> 02:50:23.296]  So, it looks like the green light was given in the last week or two, Max, to launch a major cyber attack against us, and everybody else for that matter.
[02:50:23.817 --> 02:50:29.219]  Well, the computers are programmed, and your film hit a traffic anomaly.
[02:50:29.219 --> 02:50:33.701]  It started to go in a direction that the computers couldn't figure out why.
[02:50:33.701 --> 02:50:37.443]  Because it didn't fit into any of their template logic.
[02:50:37.443 --> 02:50:42.005]  And so they shut down, or dismantled, or hacked, or took it offline.
[02:50:42.005 --> 02:50:42.945]  And this is what their program did.
[02:50:42.945 --> 02:50:43.365]  Stay there!
[02:50:43.365 --> 02:50:43.805]  Stay there!
[02:50:43.805 --> 02:50:45.006]  Because that's what Obama says.
[02:50:45.006 --> 02:50:46.927]  I've got to shut the web down to save it.
[02:50:46.927 --> 02:50:48.487]  They mean their globalist web.
[02:50:48.487 --> 02:50:51.168]  They always speak in triple meanings.
[02:50:51.168 --> 02:50:51.549]  And so...
[02:50:52.969 --> 02:50:57.912]  You've got to know there are fail safes built in to shut down things on the web when everything goes to hell in a handbasket.
[02:50:57.912 --> 02:51:01.194]  This is a cyber security takeover.
[02:51:01.194 --> 02:51:04.576]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[02:51:04.576 --> 02:51:08.479]  If it's Berkey water purification systems, this message is for you.
[02:51:08.479 --> 02:51:12.201]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[02:51:12.201 --> 02:51:20.486]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants from municipal
[02:51:20.506 --> 02:51:20.746]  I think so.
[02:51:51.947 --> 02:52:03.457]  You worry, but only because you're paying attention.
[02:52:03.457 --> 02:52:07.020]  What's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature.
[02:52:07.020 --> 02:52:14.967]  A similar audacity called GMO, or genetically modified organisms, means that the quality of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health in the balance.
[02:52:15.487 --> 02:52:20.973]  Now that summer's here, what better time to learn about the bounty that nature provides in wild edible food?
[02:52:20.973 --> 02:52:26.619]  Let author Linda Runyon show you the best-kept secret in plain sight that food is everywhere you look.
[02:52:26.619 --> 02:52:34.108]  This summer, for the cost of a good meal or two out, you can literally starvation-proof yourself and your loved ones against any future craziness and put up tons of free food, too.
[02:52:34.628 --> 02:52:40.091]  Whatever experiment is being run on us, you can rest assured that Linda's 50 or so staple foods aren't involved.
[02:52:40.091 --> 02:52:41.911]  Our foods are their enemy.
[02:52:41.911 --> 02:52:47.774]  So go to ofthefield.com or call toll-free 1-888-51-EAT-FREE and take that first step.
[02:52:47.774 --> 02:52:50.755]  Make your oasis of food security and nutrition now.
[02:52:50.755 --> 02:52:54.017]  That's O-F-T-H-E-F-I-E-L-D dot com or call 1-888-513-2837.
[02:52:54.017 --> 02:52:55.478]  Start now and make 2010 your year of independence.
[02:53:00.860 --> 02:53:03.262]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:53:03.262 --> 02:53:05.464]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:53:05.464 --> 02:53:08.786]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:53:08.786 --> 02:53:13.891]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:53:13.891 --> 02:53:18.094]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:53:18.394 --> 02:53:20.758]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:53:20.758 --> 02:53:23.622]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:53:23.622 --> 02:53:26.546]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:53:26.546 --> 02:53:34.158]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:53:34.474 --> 02:53:39.878]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:53:39.878 --> 02:53:42.180]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:53:42.180 --> 02:53:46.403]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:53:46.403 --> 02:53:47.484]  And I got news for you.
[02:53:47.484 --> 02:53:48.824]  You're everyone else.
[02:53:48.824 --> 02:53:50.326]  Invisible Empire.

[02:54:04.893 --> 02:54:14.122]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:54:14.122 --> 02:54:15.823]  Well, I hope Max Keiser's right.
[02:54:15.823 --> 02:54:17.785]  This is just a computer glitch at Google.
[02:54:17.785 --> 02:54:24.651]  But here's the Washington Post, a two-year report admitting Google is top of the heat, NSA.
[02:54:24.651 --> 02:54:28.575]  One of that CIA technology officer retired, Mr. Steele.
[02:54:28.575 --> 02:54:29.216]  What was his first name?
[02:54:29.216 --> 02:54:30.056]  We had him on a few times.
[02:54:31.358 --> 02:54:40.183]  Uh, he, you know, he said, he named In-Q-Tel, he named MIT, and everything he said, what, five years ago, and then again four years ago, he came on twice.
[02:54:40.183 --> 02:54:42.564]  He said he got so much heat, he wasn't going to come on after that.
[02:54:42.564 --> 02:54:44.465]  He told us that on the phone.
[02:54:44.465 --> 02:54:46.326]  Um, I think he got some threats, but he wouldn't say that.
[02:54:46.326 --> 02:54:47.367]  He just said, look, I can't.
[02:54:47.367 --> 02:54:49.788]  I like what you're doing, but it just, he got too heavy.
[02:54:49.788 --> 02:54:55.571]  He, he was the first person I ever said that, who said, look, they're not influenced by the CIA and NSA.
[02:54:55.571 --> 02:54:57.672]  He said, Alex, they are.
[02:54:57.672 --> 02:54:58.273]  They are.
[02:54:59.193 --> 02:55:00.294]  They are.
[02:55:00.294 --> 02:55:03.215]  And he said, check out this doctor's name, that doctor's name.
[02:55:03.215 --> 02:55:08.358]  It was MIT, it was NSA, you know, these doctors of technology, these gurus.
[02:55:08.358 --> 02:55:11.219]  And they're literally taking over the whole planet with this.
[02:55:11.219 --> 02:55:13.120]  And people say, well, why are you on Google and YouTube?
[02:55:13.120 --> 02:55:14.221]  That's the war!
[02:55:14.221 --> 02:55:15.522]  That's the internet!
[02:55:15.522 --> 02:55:17.102]  We don't give up landscape here.
[02:55:17.102 --> 02:55:18.383]  We're going back to Kenneth Webb.
[02:55:18.383 --> 02:55:20.624]  Kaiser with us on the economy and your phone calls.
[02:55:20.624 --> 02:55:24.887]  Going into the next hour in overdrive, MaxKaiser.com, his great YouTube channel.
[02:55:24.887 --> 02:55:27.228]  Stunning information, MaxKaiser.com.
[02:55:28.048 --> 02:55:31.869]  Max, do you think my analysis is accurate, or do you have anything to add to that?
[02:55:31.869 --> 02:55:35.230]  I wouldn't say it's a computer glitch.
[02:55:35.230 --> 02:55:43.292]  In other words, it's like you were playing 21 in Las Vegas, and you started to win too many hands.
[02:55:43.292 --> 02:55:46.493]  Behind the sky picks it up, and then you get a visit from the pit boss.
[02:55:47.375 --> 02:55:49.636]  So, there's no way you can beat the House.
[02:55:49.636 --> 02:55:57.799]  Now, your video started to impinge on Obama's team and their ability to control the propaganda wars and the info wars.
[02:55:57.799 --> 02:56:02.662]  So you're getting a visit from the equivalent, the equivalent of the pit boss in the virtual world.
[02:56:02.662 --> 02:56:06.063]  They need to remove you from the table because you're winning too many hands.
[02:56:07.192 --> 02:56:08.673]  And this computer picked that up.
[02:56:08.673 --> 02:56:10.874]  That's why I call it the casino gulag.
[02:56:10.874 --> 02:56:15.275]  Because a lot of the technology used to keep people in line is the same as the casino.
[02:56:15.275 --> 02:56:20.777]  They know how to incentivize you to keep you gambling, but they know how to discipline you from winning too much.
[02:56:20.777 --> 02:56:25.219]  And they also keep you unemployed and low wages, though you're there in the gulag.
[02:56:25.219 --> 02:56:33.842]  So you, Alex Jones, were winning too many views with this video, and you got a visit from the virtual pit boss who had to shut you down because you're winning too many hands.
[02:56:33.842 --> 02:56:35.163]  It's a casino gulag.
[02:56:35.919 --> 02:56:42.362]  And now we're pointing out that the House is fixed, so they're backing off because it's revealing who they really are.
[02:56:42.362 --> 02:56:45.204]  Well, it's not necessarily fixed, per se.
[02:56:45.204 --> 02:56:50.366]  It's that the human being is easily manipulated.
[02:56:50.366 --> 02:56:53.367]  And they manipulate the human being.
[02:56:53.367 --> 02:57:04.593]  See, the point of starting a country like America, to begin with, was to try to tease out the greatest part of humanity, to create something that's better and bigger than the sum of its parts.
[02:57:05.245 --> 02:57:10.567]  But now that you've got bankers in control, they're breaking it down so it's less than the sum of its parts.
[02:57:10.567 --> 02:57:16.090]  And it's just a bunch of greedy people trying to win off of each other in a less than zero outcome.
[02:57:16.090 --> 02:57:22.773]  And the bankers can set the rules so they game everything and they get the world out of fiat currency.
[02:57:22.773 --> 02:57:24.753]  They just make up out of nothing.
[02:57:24.753 --> 02:57:26.714]  As Thomas Jefferson said, they were facing it then.
[02:57:26.714 --> 02:57:32.877]  He said, if you let private banks issue currency and credit, your children will wake up homeless on the continent their forefathers conquered.
[02:57:34.028 --> 02:57:44.374]  It doesn't have to be rigged, it just has to be marginally successful, because you get the majority of people to give up their self-respect, and you end up with a casino duet.
[02:57:44.374 --> 02:57:52.920]  And you've now had a direct interaction with the pit boss in the virtual world, who's come over to you and said, sorry, you're winning too many hands, you're getting too many views, you're co-opting the word.
[02:57:53.641 --> 02:57:57.385]  Obama, which needs to be associated only with the word hope.
[02:57:57.385 --> 02:58:01.830]  We cannot tolerate the word Obama to be associated with the word deception.
[02:58:01.830 --> 02:58:03.151]  That's intolerable.
[02:58:03.151 --> 02:58:04.293]  It cannot happen.
[02:58:04.293 --> 02:58:05.314]  And we'll do whatever it takes.
[02:58:05.314 --> 02:58:08.157]  We'll stick our computer algorithms on you.
[02:58:08.157 --> 02:58:09.659]  They'll do all the dirty work.
[02:58:09.659 --> 02:58:11.441]  And I'm sorry, but that's just the way it is.
[02:58:11.441 --> 02:58:12.803]  You have to leave the casino now.
[02:58:13.502 --> 02:58:32.128]  I'm so glad we had Max Keiser on today, because he just brought out, because he's an inventor of a major stock exchange system, and very intelligent and understands this, and everything he's talked about the last few years, it's just so crystal clear how right he was, and he brought out issues here today that I didn't see or understand.
[02:58:32.128 --> 02:58:36.890]  I'm just in here toe-to-toe going at him, and my listeners are, and we're kicking their butt.
[02:58:36.890 --> 02:58:38.490]  We're gonna go into the fourth hour live.
[02:58:38.490 --> 02:58:39.511]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.

[02:58:52.657 --> 02:58:56.618]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:58:56.618 --> 02:59:05.479]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:59:05.479 --> 02:59:10.100]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:59:10.100 --> 02:59:20.922]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:59:21.562 --> 02:59:31.065]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:59:31.065 --> 02:59:36.507]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:59:36.507 --> 02:59:43.990]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
