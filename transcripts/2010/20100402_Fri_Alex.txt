[00:00:02.691 --> 00:00:04.592]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:05.092 --> 00:00:07.814]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:11.408 --> 00:00:14.289]  Okay, I mentioned this in the last hour.
[00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:19.130]  I'm going to read the article written by Paul Joseph Watson coming up here in a few minutes.
[00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.391]  It is so important.
[00:00:21.051 --> 00:00:25.112]  Feds prepare to use anarchists to provoke Tea Party violence.
[00:00:25.672 --> 00:00:31.334]  And this ties into the government setting up militias to create the perception there's this danger from gun-owning Americans.
[00:00:31.954 --> 00:00:35.937]  We have the false flag of a week and a half ago now confirmed from multiple angles.
[00:00:36.017 --> 00:00:41.662]  No one said the n-word to the congressman walking through the tea parties in front of the Capitol on the day it passed.
[00:00:42.322 --> 00:00:43.583]  No one said we're going to kill you.
[00:00:43.603 --> 00:00:44.524]  They said kill the bill.
[00:00:44.604 --> 00:00:45.865]  No one spit in their faces.
[00:00:46.385 --> 00:00:47.706]  That was a false flag.
[00:00:48.507 --> 00:00:54.451]  This is going to be their strategy to turn this around on us because the health care takeover is so unpopular.
[00:00:54.492 --> 00:00:56.553]  The greenhouse gas taxes are so unpopular.
[00:00:56.913 --> 00:00:59.776]  This whole agenda is so unpopular right now.
[00:01:00.905 --> 00:01:01.947]  So that is coming up.
[00:01:02.268 --> 00:01:06.516]  But I want to premiere here for radio listeners and PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[00:01:06.817 --> 00:01:11.085]  We're now simulcasting the last two and a half hours at PrisonPlanet.TV as we do every day.
[00:01:11.325 --> 00:01:12.027]  Some days even more.
[00:01:13.075 --> 00:01:14.515]  I want to premiere two new trailers.
[00:01:14.555 --> 00:01:18.196]  Now, the first one is for Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined.
[00:01:18.857 --> 00:01:41.163]  Then the next piece is a longer trailer, because it's not only a new police state trailer, it begins with a sneak peek, just three minutes, from the two-hour, 20-plus minute film, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, where the feds and the military were trying to set up my cameraman as terrorists that wanted to attack the military base.
[00:01:41.843 --> 00:01:46.767]  And they did this to a lady in upstate New York who just went and photographed a base because she was concerned about FEMA camps.
[00:01:47.447 --> 00:01:48.688]  This is what they do.
[00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:51.270]  So that is coming up as well.
[00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.215]  Now, both these trailers are going up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com in the next hour.
[00:01:58.295 --> 00:01:59.596]  They're not on YouTube yet.
[00:01:59.816 --> 00:02:01.317]  They're not on the Alex Jones Channel yet.
[00:02:01.337 --> 00:02:03.739]  They're not posted on InfoWars and PrisonPlanet yet.
[00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:07.742]  But when you're listening to this as a rebroadcast on stations across the country or XM,
[00:02:08.362 --> 00:02:14.630]  Coming up on Saturday and Sunday, they will both be up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.132]  You can also pre-order both the films.
[00:02:16.573 --> 00:02:18.155]  The DVDs are now being shipped to us.
[00:02:18.175 --> 00:02:19.256]  They've been manufactured.
[00:02:19.737 --> 00:02:22.060]  We'll be shipping out on April 15th.
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.683]  And of course, the first film will premiere April 15th.
[00:02:27.216 --> 00:02:33.558]  Invisible Empire, New World Order defined over two hours, jam-packed, the history of the New World Order, who they are, how they run their operations.
[00:02:34.318 --> 00:02:38.920]  And then on the 21st, we're going to premiere Police State for the Rise of FEMA at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.182]  But now is your chance to order the highest quality DVDs and that also supports this radio broadcast.
[00:02:45.462 --> 00:02:49.664]  Let's go to trailer number three for Invisible Empire.
[00:02:50.004 --> 00:02:53.465]  Yes, these men are hypnotized followers.
[00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:03.241]  Adolf Hitler, he wanted a world government.
[00:03:04.562 --> 00:03:07.283]  With himself as the master leader.
[00:03:09.024 --> 00:03:17.569]  One small central authority of individuals can then dictate a policy that's going to be distributed down to the rest of the world, everywhere.
[00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.251]  The Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the world's superclass.
[00:03:23.266 --> 00:03:29.991]  This documentary chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:03:30.331 --> 00:03:40.558]  We've become accustomed to the idea that every now and then something is going to happen and we just know from the beginning we're not going to get to the bottom of it.
[00:03:42.324 --> 00:03:50.795]  Learn how this global oligarchy controls the populace through drug trafficking, money laundering, staged terror attacks, media propaganda, and tent.
[00:03:51.175 --> 00:03:58.705]  Americans are easily motivated by false flag operations and I think it's inevitable that we will see false flag operations in the near future.
[00:03:59.065 --> 00:04:06.232]  Witness their plan for a global tax and a cashless surveillance society in which every man, woman, and child is microchipped at birth.
[00:04:06.492 --> 00:04:13.719]  A network Washington set up to run arms to the Congress wound up running cocaine for the most vicious drug cartel in the world.
[00:04:17.751 --> 00:04:25.935]  Barney Frank acknowledged having used a male prostitute, whom he then hired as a personal employee, and he ran a prostitution business out of Frank's home.
[00:04:26.075 --> 00:04:33.279]  If you look at the elite throughout history, many of the people that achieve pinnacles of power are into the occult.
[00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:36.100]  Stories about what happens in these redwoods are hard to come by.
[00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:44.510]  Invisible Empire.
[00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.671]  A new world order to find.
[00:04:47.531 --> 00:04:56.416]  Secure your copy of Invisible Empire on DVD at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com or see it in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.662]  That is a powerful trailer, and the film is even more powerful.
[00:05:03.702 --> 00:05:04.743]  Be the first to see it.
[00:05:04.943 --> 00:05:06.244]  Order your DVD today.
[00:05:06.544 --> 00:05:09.786]  We ship them out in the order that the orders are received.
[00:05:10.286 --> 00:05:18.651]  Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined, Mark Dice, and of course, G. Edward Griffin, and just so many others.
[00:05:18.731 --> 00:05:22.273]  Peter Del Scott, you name it, in this documentary film.
[00:05:22.333 --> 00:05:24.334]  Burmess, 18 months in the making.
[00:05:24.894 --> 00:05:25.755]  I had a hand in it.
[00:05:26.015 --> 00:05:27.916]  Aaron Jacobson,
[00:05:29.497 --> 00:05:40.234]  White side, the great team in here made this film possible, and it's as high a quality and as hard-hitting as Fall of the Republic, Obama deception, but with Jason's twist on it,
[00:05:41.477 --> 00:05:42.658]  Order the DVD today.
[00:05:42.738 --> 00:05:44.659]  Infowars.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:44.719]  888-253-3139.
[00:05:44.739 --> 00:05:45.899]  You can also write to me at P.O.
[00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:46.360]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.120]  It's $19.95 for 3 hours.
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.201]  It's a 2 plus hour film, 30 plus minutes of extras.
[00:05:49.221 --> 00:05:49.601]  Incredible.
[00:06:03.137 --> 00:06:09.726]  And then, of course, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, is up at three hours with the two-hour, 20-minute film, and then all the extras.
[00:06:10.487 --> 00:06:12.830]  And this film is just indescribable as well.
[00:06:13.871 --> 00:06:20.840]  I set out to make a film a year ago about FEMA camps, but I found out they were making Camp FEMA, so I waited to consult on that and be part of it, and it's excellent.
[00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:21.321]  We sell it.
[00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:33.694]  But this gets into COG, executive orders, FEMA camps, the Governor's Council, the John Moore Defense Authorization Act, the riot police, the G20, false flag terror, the underwear bomber.
[00:06:36.175 --> 00:06:39.837]  It's got Tarpley, myself, just many others.
[00:06:39.917 --> 00:06:41.638]  It's got Salente in it.
[00:06:42.498 --> 00:06:49.541]  Again, so jam-packed, and it's done in an updated style, but the same as my original police state films.
[00:06:49.601 --> 00:06:50.121]  It's powerful.
[00:06:51.482 --> 00:06:53.765]  So police state for the rise of FEMA.
[00:06:54.225 --> 00:07:03.676]  Now this intros with a sneak peek from a section where they tried to frame my camera crew in Pittsburgh as trying to
[00:07:04.918 --> 00:07:14.047]  Attack the base and then running off and then the police tried to frame him as terrorist and I had to get on the telephone and let him know that we had financial backing and that we would protect our people.
[00:07:14.607 --> 00:07:15.729]  Dew still got arrested.
[00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:19.212]  I had to spend thousands in court to defeat that fraud.
[00:07:19.232 --> 00:07:28.241]  I mean, this is an important film for anybody that's questioning whether FEMA camps are real and who want to understand this police state surveillance grid takeover.
[00:07:28.641 --> 00:07:35.085]  Here it is, Trailer 2 Extended Sneak Peek from Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[00:07:35.665 --> 00:07:43.891]  I need all Info Warriors, anyone in the Northeast, anybody in the Midwest, to go to Pittsburgh now with video cameras.
[00:07:44.191 --> 00:07:46.872]  The troops are bought and paid for by offshore banks.
[00:07:47.313 --> 00:07:49.334]  Republic is falling right now.
[00:07:49.734 --> 00:07:52.136]  They are openly bringing in Marshall Nell.
[00:07:52.176 --> 00:07:54.297]  They have troops deploying in every major city.
[00:07:54.517 --> 00:07:57.079]  We need everybody to go to Pittsburgh who loves this country.
[00:07:57.639 --> 00:08:03.523]  This is such a police state there, that they tried to talk to the military and talk to the spokesman last night?
[00:08:18.875 --> 00:08:22.897]  DefenseLink put a press release out, and they said, no, we're not going to talk until you get out of here.
[00:08:23.437 --> 00:08:30.880]  Then they got their license number, had the police pose as Alamo rental car people from the county there, Allegheny County in Pennsylvania.
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:35.642]  They called them and said, oh, your car's got no brakes, bring it in.
[00:08:36.122 --> 00:08:37.903]  And they said, well, we're in the coordinate G20.
[00:08:37.923 --> 00:08:38.803]  We're news reporters.
[00:08:39.363 --> 00:08:40.704]  We can't get out until tomorrow.
[00:08:41.204 --> 00:08:47.289]  They said, well that's fine because I'm a police officer with the Army and FBI and you've all been put on terror list and you're lost over boy.
[00:08:47.629 --> 00:08:50.852]  We know you're a terrorist and you were sneaking around the military base and ran.
[00:08:51.332 --> 00:08:51.952]  All lies!
[00:08:53.073 --> 00:08:53.994]  Okay, so I just went over.
[00:08:54.014 --> 00:08:58.938]  They're gonna have a guy come out and talk to us or they said they'll get us a number to contact.
[00:08:59.058 --> 00:08:59.979]  He said the PAO.
[00:09:00.279 --> 00:09:01.240]  This is probably him right here.
[00:09:02.239 --> 00:09:04.600]  Briefly, tell folks about last night.
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:05.781]  You guys pull up to the gate.
[00:09:06.121 --> 00:09:08.023]  You asked to talk to the public information officer.
[00:09:08.343 --> 00:09:11.885]  They called the police and lied and said that you were sneaking around.
[00:09:11.905 --> 00:09:12.926]  Yes, sir.
[00:09:12.986 --> 00:09:13.466]  How's it going?
[00:09:15.048 --> 00:09:20.269]  We were responding to a news story that the National Guard was going to be massed to go into Pittsburgh.
[00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:21.770]  Can we get a comment on that?
[00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.471]  We then pulled off to the side of the road where they instructed us to.
[00:09:24.691 --> 00:09:26.331]  We waited around 15 or 20 minutes.
[00:09:26.351 --> 00:09:28.992]  A representative came back immediately.
[00:09:29.032 --> 00:09:30.312]  He was hostile towards us.
[00:09:30.352 --> 00:09:31.712]  He did not like our credentials.
[00:09:31.892 --> 00:09:33.373]  We're out of Austin, Texas, Channel 10.
[00:09:34.153 --> 00:09:35.454]  Katie, can I see your credentials?
[00:09:35.474 --> 00:09:38.017]  We tried to get as much information as we could.
[00:09:38.057 --> 00:09:45.504]  He refused to answer our questions, so then Rob asked him for his information and where we could contact him tomorrow if we could get a word with him.
[00:09:45.524 --> 00:09:47.366]  He then gave it, and we left.
[00:09:47.406 --> 00:09:49.088]  Speech, freelance reporter.
[00:09:49.268 --> 00:09:49.568]  Yes, sir.
[00:09:49.588 --> 00:09:51.130]  Do you guys have credentials for the 320?
[00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:52.370]  I can't.
[00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:53.151]  The middle of the night.
[00:09:53.171 --> 00:09:55.372]  You come here tomorrow, we'll see what we can do if we can accommodate you.
[00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:56.172]  Is that a clock?
[00:09:56.232 --> 00:09:57.272]  We only got a few questions, man.
[00:09:57.312 --> 00:09:58.413]  Yeah, we just have like four questions.
[00:09:58.513 --> 00:09:59.293]  The answer's no.
[00:09:59.473 --> 00:10:00.073]  Not gonna comment?
[00:10:00.134 --> 00:10:01.674]  No, I'm not gonna.
[00:10:01.854 --> 00:10:02.595]  That's okay.
[00:10:02.835 --> 00:10:06.456]  If you get some credentials, you get some that I can work with, I'll do it.
[00:10:06.496 --> 00:10:07.697]  We didn't run away from anything.
[00:10:07.737 --> 00:10:20.722]  By the time that we had left, turned around, and exited the main military facility, there was another car parked on the other side of the road, waited for us to pass, followed us for an exit, then got off, and then we were shot.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.823]  And then he told Douglas, you're on a list now, pal, for the rest of your life.
[00:10:29.163 --> 00:10:30.404]  Yeah, he did.
[00:10:30.424 --> 00:10:30.985]  With pleasure.
[00:10:31.025 --> 00:10:32.145]  You ran from them, is that true?
[00:10:56.405 --> 00:10:57.705]  Good evening, my fellow Americans.
[00:10:58.766 --> 00:11:04.508]  We have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions.
[00:11:04.948 --> 00:11:11.550]  Public policy put itself to become the captive of a scientific technological elite.
[00:11:12.671 --> 00:11:13.591]  Tyranny is here.
[00:11:14.111 --> 00:11:19.953]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:11:19.993 --> 00:11:21.914]  You will not do this in future.
[00:11:25.108 --> 00:11:37.437]  They said the market would drop by 4,000 points, blood would flow in the streets, and lions would be devouring children in the parks of L.A.
[00:11:37.457 --> 00:11:38.858]  You've got the same story.
[00:11:38.978 --> 00:11:41.780]  It's just FBI training, but it was female.
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:46.283]  Do you believe that the military will fire on this game?
[00:11:58.534 --> 00:12:12.440]  Coming April 21st to the InfoWars.
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:16.702]  Secure your DVD at InfoWars.com
[00:12:20.151 --> 00:12:23.594]  Powerful new documentary film, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:24.775 --> 00:12:28.138]  And for radio listeners that want to be able to see the video, not just hear the audio...
[00:12:29.707 --> 00:12:36.370]  In the next hour, both of these will be posted at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:12:36.551 --> 00:12:41.193]  Both of the new, and I think both of these, are the best trailers.
[00:12:41.773 --> 00:12:45.735]  This is the third Invisible Empire trailer, the second Police State trailer.
[00:12:45.755 --> 00:12:55.661]  We're going to have more sneak peeks from both films coming up now in the next week and a half before Invisible Empire comes out, and the next two and a half weeks before the
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:01.383]  Rise of FEMA premieres at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:13:01.563 --> 00:13:08.548]  If you're not a PrisonPlanet.tv member, $0.15 a day, you really should become a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:12.351]  Okay, coming up, we've got Bob Chapman coming on.
[00:13:12.511 --> 00:13:15.194]  We've got Barry Cooper and Kandi Cooper in studio.
[00:13:16.243 --> 00:13:17.044]  Here's the headline.
[00:13:17.344 --> 00:13:22.427]  Police teaching kids to mistrust government makes couple unstable, unsuitable parents.
[00:13:23.027 --> 00:13:24.268]  We're going to be breaking that down.
[00:13:24.608 --> 00:13:28.450]  But here's a key Intel report for everyone joining us.
[00:13:30.452 --> 00:13:42.299]  They're passing through executive fiat the carbon taxes, shutting down the coal plants, not letting new ones get built, taxes on all homes, all businesses, all states, all electricity, all gas, all oil.
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:53.026]  The IRS is taking over health care, cutting Medicare and Medicaid, raising massive new taxes, putting new taxes on the states, doesn't cover pre-existing conditions the people are finding out.
[00:13:53.446 --> 00:14:09.956]  Rush Limbaugh said repeatedly last week, I agree with him on this, but the point is even mainstream is saying this now, mainstream conservatives, that there's no way politically without staging terror or without having a big crisis that they can get away with this in the upcoming elections, that they will stage crises.
[00:14:10.397 --> 00:14:11.698]  Michael Savage is saying it.
[00:14:12.538 --> 00:14:17.643]  So the point is, anyone who has a political brain, and who's been around, knows this is happening.
[00:14:17.863 --> 00:14:29.814]  There's open talk about shutting down talk radio, shutting down the web, Associated Press, Cybersecurity Act, FCC head says, replace alternative media and talk radio with state-owned, state-run media.
[00:14:29.854 --> 00:14:35.619]  Here's the headline, FCC advisor advocates state-run propaganda megaphone to counter alternative media.
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:39.101]  This is red alert information.
[00:14:39.621 --> 00:14:41.622]  They're arresting militias, setting them up.
[00:14:41.682 --> 00:14:42.723]  Hattari did nothing.
[00:14:42.783 --> 00:14:47.165]  Informants inside ran the whole thing, as we told you Monday, now completely confirmed.
[00:14:48.906 --> 00:14:49.886]  Now, here's the big one.
[00:14:50.266 --> 00:14:51.167]  Here's the big issue.
[00:14:52.047 --> 00:14:56.189]  Feds prepare to use anarchists to provoke Tea Party violence.
[00:14:56.729 --> 00:14:58.370]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:00.591]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:15:00.811 --> 00:15:01.251]  Alert.
[00:15:01.351 --> 00:15:02.552]  Get this out to everyone.
[00:15:03.777 --> 00:15:09.742]  It will be a devastating blow to the federal anarchists if you let them hit you and videotape it.
[00:15:10.262 --> 00:15:17.288]  It was a devastating blow that a week and a half ago, the black Congressional Congress didn't use the tunnel from the office building to the Capitol.
[00:15:17.568 --> 00:15:19.089]  They walked through the Tea Party.
[00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:21.071]  No one spit.
[00:15:21.471 --> 00:15:22.632]  No one yelled, kill them.
[00:15:22.692 --> 00:15:23.813]  No one said the N-word.
[00:15:23.873 --> 00:15:26.515]  That's now been confirmed from all the video angles.
[00:15:26.776 --> 00:15:28.177]  The media is having to backtrack.
[00:15:28.397 --> 00:15:29.418]  That was a false flag.
[00:15:30.885 --> 00:15:31.386]  They lied.
[00:15:31.466 --> 00:15:34.532]  No one was arrested like McClatchy Newspaper said.
[00:15:35.394 --> 00:15:38.980]  It was all made up and we have video from multiple angles of the incidents.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:39.922]  We played it yesterday.
[00:15:39.982 --> 00:15:42.707]  It's posted up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:15:43.766 --> 00:15:45.567]  They are desperate to demonize you.
[00:15:45.967 --> 00:15:48.948]  They know over 80% of the public is against what's happening.
[00:15:48.968 --> 00:15:50.188]  They know you're waking up.
[00:15:50.429 --> 00:15:51.769]  They will bomb federal buildings.
[00:15:52.009 --> 00:15:53.310]  They will stage mass shootings.
[00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:54.870]  They will attack IRS buildings.
[00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:57.651]  I'm telling you this isn't a question of if but when.
[00:15:57.971 --> 00:16:03.153]  Unless we get massive news out on this now, we may be able to back these people off.
[00:16:03.634 --> 00:16:07.115]  If people stop mincing their words and start telling the truth about what we're facing.
[00:16:08.925 --> 00:16:19.329]  And the fact that big Republican Party operatives are now having to tell the truth about staged attacks, staged terror, Limbaugh and Savage and others, tells you they know how much danger they're even in.
[00:16:19.789 --> 00:16:21.789]  I mean, this is a hardcore takeover happening.
[00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:25.871]  Now, here's how they're going to do one of their attack probes.
[00:16:26.874 --> 00:16:32.519]  We know the anarchists have been caught in Seattle, caught in Austin, caught in Canada two years ago, caught in Genoa, Italy.
[00:16:32.619 --> 00:16:33.700]  Flown in by government.
[00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.502]  They tump over things, burn things, attack cops.
[00:16:36.522 --> 00:16:37.583]  Many times they are cops.
[00:16:37.623 --> 00:16:40.486]  In the case of Ottawa, that's Toronto Star headline.
[00:16:40.726 --> 00:16:46.851]  Row mounted police admit they staged attacks on their own officers as pretext to attack the peaceful crowds.
[00:16:47.912 --> 00:16:51.014]  That doesn't mean people who are anarchists, real anarchists, are bad.
[00:16:51.494 --> 00:16:52.335]  I'm not saying that.
[00:16:52.395 --> 00:16:54.276]  The dissent always says I'm attacking anarchists.
[00:16:54.656 --> 00:16:56.937]  These violent groups are Fed-run.
[00:16:57.257 --> 00:16:57.818]  It's proven.
[00:16:58.958 --> 00:16:59.619]  Now listen to this.
[00:17:00.099 --> 00:17:03.281]  Feds prepare to use anarchists to provoke Tea Party violence.
[00:17:04.862 --> 00:17:10.505]  Look behind the balaclava, many of self-proclaimed anarchists, and you'll find a Stalinist thug.
[00:17:11.806 --> 00:17:34.731]  Given the past history of how so-called anarchist groups are so easily infiltrated and provocateured by the authorities to commit meaningless acts of violence that only serve to discredit political causes, we should be alarmed by the possibility that anarchist plans to, quote, crash the Tea Parties will present the perfect opportunity for the establishment to create a flashpoint with which to demonize constitutionalists and unruly extremists.
[00:17:35.151 --> 00:17:37.373]  I'll continue and finish up the article on the other side.
[00:17:37.693 --> 00:17:42.437]  Some of the biggest anarchist groups are saying they're planning to come out and get disruptive and do what they do.
[00:17:42.757 --> 00:17:53.986]  They are fed-run, fed-protected, just like the anarchist leader from Austin set up other anarchists in the firebombing at the Republican National Conference up in Minneapolis-St.
[00:17:54.046 --> 00:17:54.346]  Paul.
[00:17:54.606 --> 00:17:56.708]  I told you at the time that was a setup, now it's admitted.
[00:17:58.018 --> 00:18:03.745]  Did you know there is a growing number of researchers who agree that 90% of all disease begins in the colon?
[00:18:03.845 --> 00:18:08.891]  Did you know that 80% of all Americans suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[00:18:09.071 --> 00:18:11.734]  If allowed, our bodies are capable of healing themselves.
[00:18:11.934 --> 00:18:17.701]  The key to optimal health is not only what we eat, but also a healthy digestive system and a strong immune system.
[00:18:17.901 --> 00:18:26.752]  At Freshwater Organics, we offer FPP, a daily organic supplement that helps eliminate parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol naturally and safely.
[00:18:27.052 --> 00:18:34.561]  FPP, or fossilized phytoplankton powder, has been used worldwide for thousands of uses and is now available from Freshwater Organics.

[00:18:57.964 --> 00:18:59.226]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:18:59.266 --> 00:19:04.612]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:19:04.852 --> 00:19:09.478]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:19:09.879 --> 00:19:14.905]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:19:15.445 --> 00:19:20.127]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:19:20.667 --> 00:19:27.590]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:28.670]  And here's the best part.
[00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:35.253]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[00:19:41.935 --> 00:19:42.235]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:19:42.255 --> 00:19:45.076]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:19:45.576 --> 00:19:47.296]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:19:57.814 --> 00:20:00.715]  If you suffer from poor sleep, you've got to try MyPillow.
[00:20:01.015 --> 00:20:04.517]  Introducing the most revolutionary, most comfortable, and coolest pillow ever.

[00:20:49.298 --> 00:20:50.659]  MyPillow, for the rest of your life.
[00:21:11.397 --> 00:21:16.378]  I have seen this over and over again, and the right-wing has provocateurs too that work for their right-wing blogs.
[00:21:16.939 --> 00:21:23.440]  With the Michelle Malkin setup, when they said that I was saying, kill Michelle Malkin, we got the raw video out and showed their people were behind me, screaming it.
[00:21:23.921 --> 00:21:28.722]  So there's dirty tricks on both sides, but the big massive operation is with Obama's people.
[00:21:29.997 --> 00:21:37.660]  Continuing, according to leading Anarchist website InfoShopNews, on April 15th, thousands of right-wingers will attend rallies.
[00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:40.822]  Well, don't they agree with you more, for smaller government, Anarchists?
[00:21:40.842 --> 00:21:43.223]  But when you really meet these Anarchists, they're always wearing red stars.
[00:21:43.743 --> 00:21:48.525]  On April 15th, thousands of right-wingers will attend rallies in cities and towns across the United States.
[00:21:49.045 --> 00:21:52.807]  The organizers of these nationwide day of protests call it a Tea Party.
[00:21:52.847 --> 00:22:08.053]  This Tea Party movement that emerged only a year ago is a coalition of conservatives, anti-Semites, fascists, libertarians, racists, constitutionalists, militiamen, gun freaks, homophobes, Ron Paul supporters, and Alex Jones conspiracy types, and American flag wavers.
[00:22:08.073 --> 00:22:09.494]  Yeah, you don't want to wave that American flag.
[00:22:10.034 --> 00:22:12.255]  So I'm lumped in with those evil flag wavers.
[00:22:12.595 --> 00:22:31.341]  In one paragraph, the so-called anarchists have regurgitated wholesale the exact rhetoric that the corporate-owned media, their supposed adversaries, have been spewing ceaselessly for months on end that anyone who opposes big government, which is what anarchists are supposed to do, is a racist and a extremist.
[00:22:34.295 --> 00:22:39.882]  While also lying about the origins of the Tea Party, which is in fact started by Ron Paul supporters as early as 2007.
[00:22:40.082 --> 00:22:49.513]  The anarchist's primary reason for wanting to crash Tea Party demonstrations, because as the Tea Party movement takes over the country, they will really hurt...
[00:22:50.154 --> 00:22:53.077]  Yeah, most of these attack groups that call themselves anarchists are communists.
[00:22:53.117 --> 00:22:53.837]  I mean, I've been there.
[00:22:53.897 --> 00:22:57.120]  I've seen them wearing red stars and talking about Mao Zedong and how great he is.
[00:23:16.616 --> 00:23:20.978]  The article continues here, as Kurt Nemo points out, these people are not anarchists at all.
[00:23:21.298 --> 00:23:28.602]  They are leftist, teenage socialist punks who like to call themselves workers, but a good portion of whom have probably never worked a day in their life.
[00:23:28.842 --> 00:23:34.305]  They make for perfect puppets through which the establishment can manipulate to demonize its real political adversaries.
[00:23:34.345 --> 00:23:40.868]  And then they link to all the news articles for page after page, Denver Post, Toronto Star, all the articles
[00:23:41.408 --> 00:23:58.916]  Where mainstream news admits the police stage these groups and stage these events 110% they've been caught over and over and over and over again all over this nation all over the world all over other countries and
[00:24:00.256 --> 00:24:01.697]  That's just the first part of the article.
[00:24:01.717 --> 00:24:05.500]  I'm going to come back and cover some more of it.
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:19.449]  But as we have constantly warned, the latter half of April represents the most dangerous time period for when we can expect violence to be staged and provocateured, which will instantly be blamed on Tea Partiers, Libertarians, and Constitutionalists.
[00:24:19.849 --> 00:24:28.055]  A brief history of how anarchist groups have been infiltrated and steered by authorities to commit mayhem and violence in order to justify a crackdown of free speech
[00:24:28.915 --> 00:24:32.579]  And the right to assemble has never been more prescient.
[00:24:33.419 --> 00:24:34.120]  Then we have the links.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.682]  Feds prepare to use anarchists to provoke Tea Party violence.
[00:24:37.683 --> 00:24:40.666]  We have another link here at the G20 Summit where they got caught doing it.
[00:24:41.026 --> 00:24:42.548]  We have links all over the world.
[00:24:42.568 --> 00:24:43.609]  The 1999 WTO, the 2008 situation in Canada.
[00:24:44.009 --> 00:24:45.671]  We have links to all of this.
[00:24:50.615 --> 00:24:51.215]  I don't know.
[00:25:10.592 --> 00:25:13.053]  The closest thing to truth there is kill the bill.
[00:25:13.153 --> 00:25:13.713]  Kill the bill.
[00:25:13.793 --> 00:25:14.973]  No spitting, no N-word.
[00:25:15.433 --> 00:25:17.834]  That video is all out there of the actual incident.
[00:25:17.874 --> 00:25:19.434]  They claim people were arrested for doing it.
[00:25:19.615 --> 00:25:20.455]  They were not arrested.
[00:25:20.795 --> 00:25:21.775]  All part of this hoax.
[00:25:22.095 --> 00:25:23.155]  And we're now into April.
[00:25:23.196 --> 00:25:25.096]  It is April 2nd on this Friday edition.
[00:25:25.436 --> 00:25:29.377]  This is the time, as we go into this, Tea Party people need to be made aware of this.
[00:25:29.697 --> 00:25:30.598]  They need to have cameras.
[00:25:30.618 --> 00:25:31.718]  They need to have video cameras.
[00:25:31.738 --> 00:25:33.018]  They need to be protecting themselves.
[00:25:33.298 --> 00:25:34.679]  And they need to be non-violent.
[00:25:34.859 --> 00:25:35.499]  We'll be right back.
[00:25:39.321 --> 00:25:41.362]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:25:52.684 --> 00:25:55.425]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:25:55.445 --> 00:25:59.866]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:26:00.766 --> 00:26:05.227]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from InfoWars.com.

[00:27:02.202 --> 00:27:06.367]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:27:07.028 --> 00:27:07.849]  You want answers?
[00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:09.551]  Well, so does he.
[00:27:09.571 --> 00:27:13.836]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:14.377 --> 00:27:18.422]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27:22.625 --> 00:27:28.974]  Well, for the next hour, Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com will be riding shotgun with us.
[00:27:28.994 --> 00:27:31.458]  He'll talk about some of the big developments in the economy.
[00:27:31.498 --> 00:27:36.646]  The federal government openly saying they're preparing to take private and public pension funds to give it to the private banks.
[00:27:36.686 --> 00:27:37.627]  That is Bloomberg.
[00:27:38.448 --> 00:27:44.233]  The latest developments there, but Bob Chapman of course has been run out of the United States for exposing these people, shot at, you name it.
[00:27:44.653 --> 00:27:46.294]  He helped publish the book Gary Allen.
[00:27:46.314 --> 00:27:47.856]  They put out over 5 million copies.
[00:27:48.256 --> 00:27:49.937]  He's been fighting for more than 50 years.
[00:27:49.997 --> 00:27:55.822]  Former military intelligence worked in Germany, South Africa, you name it.
[00:27:56.302 --> 00:28:00.505]  But this was the only hour we could get them on today because I learned of this this morning.
[00:28:01.366 --> 00:28:07.108]  I knew, because it was in the AP and other publications, a month or so ago, that he got set up by Williamson County.
[00:28:07.128 --> 00:28:14.531]  He's a former narcotics officer who does stings, exposing government violations of the Fourth Amendment, cops stealing drugs, you name it.
[00:28:14.831 --> 00:28:19.172]  And after he did a big sting, they arrested him and took their son.
[00:28:20.233 --> 00:28:25.135]  They have taken their son, and I have the CPS police report saying they took him because,
[00:28:28.103 --> 00:28:33.487]  Parents are unsuitable and create an environment where the children believe the government is out to harm them.
[00:28:33.887 --> 00:28:42.653]  So the headline up at InfoWars.com, cops and CPSC's child from parents for mistrusting government.
[00:28:43.034 --> 00:28:44.375]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:28:44.755 --> 00:28:45.956]  This is the Soviet Union.
[00:28:45.976 --> 00:28:48.157]  I want to go to Bob Chapman before we come back with these folks.
[00:28:48.397 --> 00:28:49.678]  Then we'll get into all the other issues.
[00:28:49.999 --> 00:28:54.141]  But Bob, you were just telling me about another case of this with Canada and the US.
[00:28:54.201 --> 00:28:56.063]  I mean this is, this is bad.
[00:28:56.383 --> 00:28:58.724]  We're now under these rules of war against the people.
[00:28:58.984 --> 00:29:00.845]  They take your children for your political beliefs.
[00:29:02.606 --> 00:29:06.387]  Well, this family was in New Brunswick and it abuts Arista County.
[00:29:06.867 --> 00:29:09.548]  That's how it's pronounced, incidentally, in Maine.
[00:29:09.849 --> 00:29:12.890]  And they had bought a farm in New Brunswick.
[00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:16.111]  And the former owners of that farm had moved down the way.
[00:29:16.631 --> 00:29:17.952]  And they wanted to go down and see them.
[00:29:18.372 --> 00:29:22.414]  So they went down the road and there were a couple of signs, but they thought they took the right road.
[00:29:22.454 --> 00:29:22.934]  They didn't.
[00:29:23.522 --> 00:29:30.726]  And they were immediately pulled over by Border Patrol, and they told them that, uh, they said, you Canadians, and they said, yeah.
[00:29:31.026 --> 00:29:32.667]  They said, you're under arrest.
[00:29:33.008 --> 00:29:40.072]  Now, this is a dog, and two little girls, and a man, and I think his wife was there, too.
[00:29:40.852 --> 00:29:48.036]  And, uh, they think it printed them and, uh, charged them, but they said they were going to let them go so they could return to Canada.
[00:29:48.417 --> 00:29:50.798]  Now, what are these people thinking about?
[00:29:52.102 --> 00:29:53.643]  I'm talking about Border Patrol.
[00:29:57.146 --> 00:29:57.926]  I just don't get it.
[00:29:59.648 --> 00:30:09.115]  Well, Bob, we're going to discuss this case coming up in the next segment and get your take on it, and then about 30-40 minutes into the interview, our guests will leave us, but this was an emergency situation.
[00:30:09.415 --> 00:30:11.156]  Then we'll get into the economy and other issues.
[00:30:11.917 --> 00:30:14.679]  What do you think about the Fed-run anarchist announcing
[00:30:15.259 --> 00:30:21.885]  Now it's going to continue to degenerate and the reason it is taking the form that it's taking is it being forced to.
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:53.462]  And you set a perfect example of that last Friday when we talked about and then you did some further work on the fact that CNN wanted to interview you.
[00:30:53.782 --> 00:30:55.142]  They don't know what to do.
[00:30:55.622 --> 00:30:57.643]  They're trying to stop us and they can't.
[00:30:58.543 --> 00:31:00.503]  And so they're branching out.
[00:31:01.023 --> 00:31:06.444]  They're trying to be disruptive everywhere that they can in order to keep us off balance.
[00:31:06.484 --> 00:31:07.424]  And it's not going to.
[00:31:07.984 --> 00:31:11.245]  Because we're telling the truth and we're not breaking the law.
[00:31:11.898 --> 00:31:14.319]  And we want everybody to know what their rights are.
[00:31:14.539 --> 00:31:19.521]  And we want everybody to know what's going on out there, what the government is doing.
[00:31:21.942 --> 00:31:24.824]  Well, we're going to cover all of that coming up.
[00:31:25.144 --> 00:31:26.104]  There's also some good news.
[00:31:26.124 --> 00:31:29.085]  A federal judge finds NSA wiretaps were illegal.
[00:31:30.646 --> 00:31:31.907]  And so we'll be breaking that down.
[00:31:32.307 --> 00:31:38.069]  But coming up, police say teaching kids to mistrust government makes a couple unsuitable parents.
[00:31:38.089 --> 00:31:39.050]  That's from Truce Slant.
[00:31:40.229 --> 00:31:43.093]  We also have our article on this that's more detailed.
[00:31:43.153 --> 00:31:47.017]  Cops and CPS seize child from parents for mistrusting government.
[00:31:47.037 --> 00:31:50.141]  You're not allowed to teach children to not trust the state.
[00:31:50.161 --> 00:31:56.348]  I guess Thomas Jefferson would have had his family taken away because of his common sense.
[00:31:56.408 --> 00:31:56.949]  We'll be right back.
[00:31:57.981 --> 00:32:00.602]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:32:01.002 --> 00:32:05.963]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:32:06.323 --> 00:32:08.064]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:32:08.364 --> 00:32:13.185]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:32:13.365 --> 00:32:14.325]  How much do you want?
[00:32:14.565 --> 00:32:15.306]  When do you want it?
[00:32:15.686 --> 00:32:17.286]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:32:17.566 --> 00:32:18.387]  When will you need it?
[00:32:18.647 --> 00:32:20.707]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:32:20.847 --> 00:32:21.947]  Will there be any food?
[00:32:22.188 --> 00:32:23.488]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:32:23.848 --> 00:32:26.090]  There's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:28.773]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:32:28.973 --> 00:32:32.176]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:32:32.556 --> 00:32:36.060]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:37.361]  How much will you need?
[00:32:37.601 --> 00:32:38.222]  We don't know.
[00:32:38.502 --> 00:32:39.423]  How much do you want?
[00:32:39.623 --> 00:32:40.344]  All you can get.
[00:32:40.544 --> 00:32:41.225]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:32:41.625 --> 00:32:42.045]  I think so.
[00:32:57.062 --> 00:32:58.323]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:58.383 --> 00:33:03.728]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:33:03.968 --> 00:33:08.593]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:33:08.993 --> 00:33:09.393]  It's true.
[00:33:09.474 --> 00:33:14.018]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:33:14.558 --> 00:33:19.243]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:33:19.784 --> 00:33:26.711]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:33:26.891 --> 00:33:27.792]  And here's the best part.
[00:33:28.012 --> 00:33:34.379]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[00:33:41.442 --> 00:33:44.183]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:33:44.683 --> 00:33:46.424]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:33:58.646 --> 00:34:02.267]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:34:02.607 --> 00:34:10.750]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:34:11.470 --> 00:34:15.511]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:34:16.111 --> 00:34:26.935]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:34:27.555 --> 00:34:36.557]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:34:37.057 --> 00:34:42.098]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:34:42.499 --> 00:34:49.680]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:52.721]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:34:57.884 --> 00:35:05.629]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:17.236]  Alright, we're back live, eight minutes into the third hour.
[00:35:17.256 --> 00:35:22.760]  Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster riding shotgun with us for the rest of the hour, going into the economy, anarchist groups.
[00:35:23.823 --> 00:35:31.509]  espousing communism and socialism, that's the opposite of anarchy, are saying they're going to go out and provocateur and basically attack Tea Parties nationwide.
[00:35:31.809 --> 00:35:33.491]  We know they're foundation and government funded.
[00:35:33.511 --> 00:35:34.171]  We've proven that.
[00:35:34.491 --> 00:35:38.174]  Paul Watson has a detailed article breaking all of this down.
[00:35:38.194 --> 00:35:39.175]  It is so important.
[00:35:39.735 --> 00:35:44.039]  But when I read this this morning, I had seen it in the Associated Press, I had read it a month ago.
[00:35:44.479 --> 00:35:46.401]  Police raid never get busted.
[00:35:46.601 --> 00:35:51.424]  HQ, Barry Cooper, who lives in North Travis County, I guess on the Williamson County line,
[00:35:52.205 --> 00:36:00.751]  And I'd warned him when he moved down here as a former narcotics officer that the most corrupt county in Texas, one of the most corrupt in the nation, is Williamson County.
[00:36:01.571 --> 00:36:08.516]  Their Georgetown Police Department, their Round Rock Police Department, the county itself, the state police they've got up there.
[00:36:08.536 --> 00:36:14.800]  I mean, the things we've seen with their mayors, and it just goes on and on.
[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:18.323]  And they feed on the public up there, and I said, I wouldn't live there.
[00:36:18.823 --> 00:36:20.864]  And he's like, well, I can handle him.
[00:36:21.184 --> 00:36:22.885]  He started running stings against him.
[00:36:22.905 --> 00:36:24.066]  We're going to talk about that.
[00:36:25.066 --> 00:36:29.909]  And he's put the videos out on the web with the stings he ran on the police in Williamson County.
[00:36:29.949 --> 00:36:33.071]  Well, they raided him, but that wasn't enough.
[00:36:33.211 --> 00:36:37.533]  I have the CPS report here out of Williamson County provided by the Coopers.
[00:36:37.573 --> 00:36:40.614]  It was Max Kaiser this morning that called us and told us about this.
[00:36:40.695 --> 00:36:41.735]  I had missed it this morning.
[00:36:42.676 --> 00:36:45.037]  This is Cooper Candice.
[00:36:45.637 --> 00:36:46.237]  That's Candy.
[00:36:48.462 --> 00:36:49.162]  Mrs. Cooper.
[00:36:49.903 --> 00:36:53.384]  And it says, uh, releasable copy volume one.
[00:36:53.505 --> 00:36:57.687]  And this is put out, we're going to give you a document cam shot of this for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers right now.
[00:36:58.947 --> 00:37:05.050]  This is the, this is the police, uh, investigation, uh, report.
[00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:07.231]  And when you turn in here, they give the reason.
[00:37:07.712 --> 00:37:11.193]  Please explain your current concerns regarding supervision of the children.
[00:37:11.213 --> 00:37:12.894]  This is when they went to the CPS and filed this.
[00:37:13.334 --> 00:37:14.455]  Parents are
[00:37:16.084 --> 00:37:21.930]  Unsuitable as and create an environment where the children believe the government is out to harm them.
[00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:29.217]  Again, parents are unsuitable and create an environment where the children believe the government is out to harm them.
[00:37:30.739 --> 00:37:33.121]  And it goes on from there.
[00:37:33.201 --> 00:37:35.904]  And that's why they took their children.
[00:37:36.224 --> 00:37:37.766]  And here's the article from True Slant.
[00:37:37.826 --> 00:37:38.887]  Police threatening kids
[00:37:42.455 --> 00:37:49.079]  And the police go on to say, police teaching kids to mistrust government makes couple unsuitable parents.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.381]  Here's the PrisonPlanet.com article.
[00:37:51.701 --> 00:37:55.844]  Cops and CPS seize children from parents for mistrusting government.
[00:37:56.284 --> 00:37:58.946]  And so, Barry and Candy Cooper are here.
[00:37:59.546 --> 00:38:05.050]  They have their eight-year-old daughter, but their son has been taken by the government.
[00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:07.512]  And their eight-year-old daughter is here with them today.
[00:38:07.832 --> 00:38:10.734]  Barry, just give people, and Candy, give people a
[00:38:11.334 --> 00:38:18.037]  Basic boil down of what happened in Williamson County, why they came at you and went after your children because of this.
[00:38:18.497 --> 00:38:27.180]  Well, our first sting in Odessa where we stung the cops resulted in a lady getting released from federal prison about two months ago.
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:31.422]  And coming off the success of that, we went into Williamson County because of all the complaints.
[00:38:31.462 --> 00:38:32.962]  And I actually live in Travis County.
[00:38:33.002 --> 00:38:34.223]  I took your advice, Alex.
[00:38:34.783 --> 00:38:35.724]  OK, so I was confused.
[00:38:35.744 --> 00:38:39.485]  So they got you out of the jur- I mean, they waited to get you in their jurisdiction.
[00:38:39.665 --> 00:38:52.311]  Well, what they did, my daughter and I were headed to the university to give a speech and they got Travis County Narcotics along with Williamson County Narcotics to arrest me and took us to our house.
[00:38:52.331 --> 00:38:54.191]  So they knew you were going to a speech, they were waiting.
[00:38:54.331 --> 00:38:54.652]  Go ahead.
[00:38:54.692 --> 00:38:59.714]  Yeah, they were waiting and I was in handcuffs and my daughter was out in the driveway and they forced us
[00:39:00.314 --> 00:39:08.380]  To watch a felony raid on our home with no way to to warn candy and it was because we had went into Williamson County and did a sting.
[00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:11.062]  I caught a cop there stealing drug money.
[00:39:11.482 --> 00:39:15.225]  I put the free video up on our website nevergetbusted.com.
[00:39:15.245 --> 00:39:18.207]  It's 45 minutes and five days later they raided us.
[00:39:19.079 --> 00:39:22.402]  Well, so you did take my advice, because I was worried about you.
[00:39:22.422 --> 00:39:24.484]  You were saying I may move up there and may run stings.
[00:39:24.504 --> 00:39:25.945]  And I said, well, you've got a lot of courage.
[00:39:26.386 --> 00:39:27.707]  But I knew they were going to do this to you.
[00:39:27.727 --> 00:39:31.371]  I mean, I've never seen anybody as dangerous as Williamson County.
[00:39:31.891 --> 00:39:33.192]  Well, you know.
[00:39:34.273 --> 00:39:35.774]  Alex, it is a police state.
[00:39:35.914 --> 00:39:43.419]  I had no idea because we had our lawyers look at all over all the sting material and they said I was safe as far as not breaking any laws.
[00:39:43.919 --> 00:39:51.224]  But two days in solitary confinement away from my family, they actually wouldn't even book me in jail for over 15 hours.
[00:39:51.264 --> 00:39:55.687]  They kept me hidden and our lawyers and stuff would call and they said, no, he's not in this jail.
[00:39:56.187 --> 00:40:00.388]  They had me in solitary confinement the whole time searching our home.
[00:40:00.548 --> 00:40:08.349]  They did that for four hours and took all of our media, all of our computers, all of my tapes that we had worked so hard in three years on.
[00:40:08.969 --> 00:40:20.031]  And then it resulted in a big CPS investigation where they made comments that they were concerned with our daughter's safety because she had sudden outburst of crying for no reason during the raid.
[00:40:20.512 --> 00:40:21.652]  Well, that's crazy.
[00:40:21.712 --> 00:40:22.752]  Of course she's crying.
[00:40:22.932 --> 00:40:24.073]  Yeah, that's in here too.
[00:40:24.193 --> 00:40:28.638]  So they rage you, they cry, and they usually try to put kids on Prozac if they cry.
[00:40:28.918 --> 00:40:32.682]  Oh, we took you from your parents, you're crying, we're going to put you on deadly drugs.
[00:40:33.362 --> 00:40:33.843]  Incredible.
[00:40:33.983 --> 00:40:38.388]  Well, they even go on in that report to say that we give our kids drugs.
[00:40:38.948 --> 00:40:39.748]  Which is nuts.
[00:40:39.808 --> 00:40:41.429]  There's no proof or evidence of that.
[00:40:41.469 --> 00:40:42.850]  We don't give our kids drugs.
[00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:52.134]  What happened is, since we got the girl out of prison and we busted the Williamson County deputy, they realized we were no longer a nuisance and became a serious threat.
[00:40:52.534 --> 00:40:55.555]  And we're feeling the full force of the government on our family right now.
[00:40:55.555 --> 00:41:06.700]  And you were a former highly decorated narcotics officer who refused to go along with all the frame-ups, just like Dr. Frederick Whitehurst, former head of the FBI crime lab we had on two days ago, just saying it's totally criminal.
[00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:11.321]  I mean, it is operating procedure to frame people.
[00:41:13.646 --> 00:41:15.989]  Please continue with the CPS situation.
[00:41:16.229 --> 00:41:28.005]  They raided us on a misdemeanor for one false report to a peace officer and in the affidavit it even says an unidentified caller called in the suspicious bag which had the drug money that I planted in it
[00:41:29.126 --> 00:41:33.350]  But the truth is, in that affidavit, they said they heard my voice in the background.
[00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:37.033]  So they rated us on a misdemeanor, which never happens.
[00:41:37.853 --> 00:41:39.635]  And we had to fight for our lives.
[00:41:39.695 --> 00:41:49.162]  And right now, our 8-year-old son, named Zach Johnson, is in East Texas now, in a bad place, a bad situation.
[00:41:49.202 --> 00:41:50.663]  He's got cerebral palsy.
[00:41:51.044 --> 00:41:52.064]  He's almost deaf.
[00:41:53.345 --> 00:41:57.206]  He's on a four-year-old level and we've never been away from him his entire life.
[00:41:57.246 --> 00:41:59.647]  Now let's be clear, whose son is he biologically?
[00:41:59.847 --> 00:42:00.087]  Mine.
[00:42:00.527 --> 00:42:08.290]  Yes, and he's almost his entire life he's been with you guys and but thank God he's not just in CPS hands though, at least he is with his father.
[00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:08.610]  Yes.
[00:42:09.252 --> 00:42:10.573]  Which I don't know which is worse.
[00:42:11.234 --> 00:42:24.865]  Which we kind of think we'd rather be in CPS's hand as bad as that sounds because now we're going into East Texas courts and in that affidavit they're bringing up statements that Berry and Candy are nationally recognized marijuana advocates.
[00:42:25.286 --> 00:42:32.732]  Berry and Candy appear on Fox News all the time and they make claims such as everything the
[00:42:33.112 --> 00:42:39.895]  The government, our teachers, our churches, and our parents taught us about narcotics was wrong, which that's true.
[00:42:40.255 --> 00:42:42.576]  So they're accusing us of all these things that are true.
[00:42:42.596 --> 00:42:45.117]  It's our political... Marijuana is listed as a narcotic.
[00:42:45.557 --> 00:42:45.817]  It is.
[00:42:46.137 --> 00:42:47.878]  By them, in fact.
[00:42:48.158 --> 00:42:55.481]  So all of this is going on, and in the report, they took the children, they took your son because
[00:42:57.495 --> 00:43:04.780]  How did they learn supposedly that you were saying bad things about the government and how is it their right to take a child now because parents say don't trust the government?
[00:43:06.033 --> 00:43:09.914]  It was my ex-husband, which we've been friends with this whole time.
[00:43:10.254 --> 00:43:12.034]  For three years, he knew what we did.
[00:43:12.955 --> 00:43:15.415]  He's been at our house, you know, we were all friends.
[00:43:15.975 --> 00:43:22.577]  He found out through, I guess... A lawyer that we sued for $10 million on a false raid three years ago.
[00:43:22.637 --> 00:43:27.418]  Williamson County Narcotics Unit called that lawyer and said, we've got Barry Cooper now.
[00:43:27.478 --> 00:43:34.640]  So that lawyer got with the real father of Zach, and it really is a conspiracy.
[00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:35.800]  Yes.
[00:43:56.412 --> 00:43:59.875]  And of course we teach that the government is out to get us.
[00:43:59.915 --> 00:44:05.560]  They're the ones who came into the house and pointed guns at my kids and put me in jail for something that I didn't do.
[00:44:05.981 --> 00:44:18.472]  It's all for busting that cop and he's a captain at Liberty Hill Police Department that we had been getting complaints on and we set a trap for him and we stung him and there was an HBO film crew there when we confronted
[00:44:18.852 --> 00:44:24.255]  The chief of police with the video evidence, and five days later, they were raiding our house.
[00:44:24.295 --> 00:44:29.158]  And that raid and jail was nothing, Alex, compared to us losing our son.
[00:44:29.238 --> 00:44:30.679]  Well, this sets a precedent now.
[00:44:30.699 --> 00:44:35.061]  I mean, the police say, you're criticizing the government, we're going to take your child.
[00:44:35.361 --> 00:44:36.442]  I want to go to Bob Chapman.
[00:44:36.482 --> 00:44:39.364]  Bob, this is classic terrorism.
[00:44:39.404 --> 00:44:43.926]  In the rules of war, and this is even war, this is political, you don't go after children and women.
[00:44:45.467 --> 00:44:50.872]  That has always been the rule, because armies and systems don't want their forces going after their families.
[00:44:50.892 --> 00:44:52.153]  That's prasada non grata.
[00:44:52.693 --> 00:44:58.378]  As a veteran, as military intelligence, as a patriot, Bob, does this make your blood boil to hear this case?
[00:44:59.299 --> 00:45:00.280]  Well, it certainly does.
[00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:07.286]  It shows how out of control not only the federal government is, but other forms of government in law enforcement.
[00:45:08.027 --> 00:45:10.329]  And, you know, you say to yourself, where does it all end?
[00:45:11.450 --> 00:45:12.511]  Where are the good people?
[00:45:13.908 --> 00:45:16.550]  I mean, how do these things happen?
[00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:17.511]  And they are happening!
[00:45:18.271 --> 00:45:21.994]  This is a true story we're listening to here.
[00:45:22.014 --> 00:45:24.076]  I mean, I have the report!
[00:45:24.116 --> 00:45:31.321]  They say they took the child and are just trying to get the others because these people teach their kids to not trust the government!
[00:45:32.522 --> 00:45:34.664]  I mean, that's as American as apple pie, Bob!
[00:45:34.684 --> 00:45:37.886]  It certainly is.
[00:45:39.467 --> 00:45:41.629]  So, what course have you taken
[00:45:42.909 --> 00:45:47.477]  Uh, with the boy and getting him released.
[00:45:48.018 --> 00:45:48.979]  What does that stand?
[00:45:49.039 --> 00:45:49.761]  That's a good question.
[00:45:49.801 --> 00:45:51.343]  What course are you taking to get your son back?
[00:45:52.079 --> 00:45:53.279]  We are fighting.
[00:45:53.379 --> 00:45:54.960]  Actually, we're in East Texas.
[00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:58.440]  We're fighting for change of venue so we can get it here.
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:00.041]  Travis County.
[00:46:00.061 --> 00:46:03.281]  We're having to drive to East Texas and pay lawyers a lot of money.
[00:46:03.341 --> 00:46:11.383]  By the way, any donations would really help us because we are a family out here doing all of this and the government's got more money than we do.
[00:46:11.443 --> 00:46:14.984]  But we're fighting it out in East Texas courts, which is really tough.
[00:46:15.024 --> 00:46:16.484]  So we go back in two weeks.
[00:46:17.421 --> 00:46:20.263]  And that two weeks feels like two years being away from our son.
[00:46:20.343 --> 00:46:26.247]  But we go back in two weeks for a venue change, and if we get that, then the Travis County Courts here will be able to take over.
[00:46:26.307 --> 00:46:27.628]  What venue is this in right now?
[00:46:28.048 --> 00:46:30.129]  It's in Upshur County, Texas.
[00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:31.971]  The Bible Belt.
[00:46:32.011 --> 00:46:35.673]  240 churches in that one county, and they do not like it.
[00:46:35.693 --> 00:46:40.637]  And they have no idea police are dealing drugs, selling drugs, using this to put their kids in prison.
[00:46:40.937 --> 00:46:47.001]  They think it's of the Lord, and the CIA don't bring it in, and you are of the devil.
[00:46:47.401 --> 00:46:49.407]  That's exactly right, and that's what we're fighting.
[00:46:49.568 --> 00:46:52.196]  And what they're actually doing is allowing the devil to take over.
[00:46:52.517 --> 00:46:53.701]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:46:57.961 --> 00:46:58.281]  Fact.
[00:46:58.301 --> 00:46:59.862]  4 million people in the U.S.
[00:46:59.902 --> 00:47:01.702]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[00:47:02.022 --> 00:47:02.342]  Fact.
[00:47:02.542 --> 00:47:05.903]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the 8th leading cause of death among Americans.
[00:47:06.223 --> 00:47:06.543]  Fact.
[00:47:06.843 --> 00:47:12.145]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[00:47:12.345 --> 00:47:12.685]  Fact.
[00:47:12.705 --> 00:47:16.846]  1 in 10 Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[00:47:17.186 --> 00:47:17.526]  Fact.
[00:47:17.766 --> 00:47:21.467]  Anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.

[00:48:10.686 --> 00:48:14.871]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:48:15.171 --> 00:48:17.512]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:48:17.632 --> 00:48:20.053]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:48:20.073 --> 00:48:22.994]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:48:23.315 --> 00:48:30.918]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:48:31.258 --> 00:48:36.523]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:48:36.643 --> 00:48:38.925]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:48:38.965 --> 00:48:42.928]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:48:43.188 --> 00:48:44.109]  And I got news for you.

[00:51:23.708 --> 00:51:28.853]  He's going to tell some of the interesting stories, things he's witnessed doing this over the years.
[00:51:28.873 --> 00:51:37.482]  I met him and found he was a fan and a listener when he took photos of myself for one of the cover stories for Texas Monthly last month.
[00:51:39.417 --> 00:51:40.637]  So that should be interesting coming up.
[00:51:40.657 --> 00:51:42.618]  And of course, Bob Chapman's riding shotgun with us.
[00:51:43.398 --> 00:51:53.000]  You were just telling me that you guys have been threatened now, and that I don't even want to make your ex-husband, you know, the bad guy here.
[00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:53.440]  And I asked that.
[00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:54.480]  You said, no, he's not really.
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:55.720]  He's being threatened.
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:56.960]  He's being pressured.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.901]  I guess the choice of CPS or take your son.
[00:52:01.081 --> 00:52:04.542]  But first, let's get into the threats, Barry.
[00:52:05.495 --> 00:52:25.971]  Well, we've received threats and attorneys of ours that know some people high up and we've gotten hundreds of phone calls, people warning us and some other police officers that if we continue doing these cop stings, the next step is they'll plant something on me and put me away for 20 years or they'll shoot me.
[00:52:27.006 --> 00:52:31.828]  So, like I said, we're one family exposing corruption, and the cost is very high.
[00:52:31.908 --> 00:52:33.609]  I had no idea this would ever happen.
[00:52:33.889 --> 00:52:35.609]  Well, you're also getting ready to run for political office.
[00:52:35.629 --> 00:52:36.970]  That's another reason they want to bust you.
[00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:39.391]  Yeah, I'm actually running for Texas Attorney General.
[00:52:40.111 --> 00:52:48.955]  And, by the way, one of the judges, I'd also let it out that if I didn't win Texas Attorney General, that I was going to run for judge in Precinct 5 of Austin.
[00:52:49.375 --> 00:52:54.197]  It turns out it was that judge in Precinct 5 that signed the search warrant to our home.
[00:52:55.600 --> 00:53:01.804]  Wow, so this is the political boss hogs in these counties are going, boy, you don't expose the good business we got.
[00:53:02.064 --> 00:53:03.986]  We got these Christians around here fooled.
[00:53:04.006 --> 00:53:05.286]  We're trying to stop everything.
[00:53:05.687 --> 00:53:07.288]  They don't understand how it really works.
[00:53:07.328 --> 00:53:08.929]  Now you going to keep your mouth shut, boy.
[00:53:09.609 --> 00:53:10.670]  That's exactly right.
[00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:13.232]  That was very good impression of what we're up against.
[00:53:14.147 --> 00:53:14.988]  We run this county.
[00:53:15.028 --> 00:53:16.288]  We run these slaves around here.
[00:53:16.769 --> 00:53:24.013]  Yeah, and the JP that signed the arrest warrant for us, it's her son that's the prosecutor on this case.
[00:53:24.513 --> 00:53:36.480]  The sergeant that raided my house, I used to be a hero of his when I was a narcotics officer teaching other officers throughout academies in Texas how to seize the narcotics that I was seizing.
[00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:38.741]  And I was one of his heroes.
[00:53:39.202 --> 00:53:41.483]  And since I switched side, he's had a vendetta
[00:53:42.003 --> 00:53:45.865]  Against us ever since so when we busted one of his friends stealing drug money.
[00:53:46.265 --> 00:54:07.514]  That's when he came through our door with the guns drawn But again the key to all of this here is the police report confidential That was that you guys got a hold up, so we're allowed to release it here, and it says the reason your son was taken Please explain your current concerns regarding supervision of the child children parents are unsuitable for
[00:54:08.414 --> 00:54:12.718]  And create an environment where the children believe the government is out to harm them.
[00:54:12.858 --> 00:54:19.783]  And Alex, there's another statement in there that says Barry doesn't believe in church and hates his dad and wants his dad to die.
[00:54:20.424 --> 00:54:24.787]  Well, it's true I don't believe in the church because of the harms they've brought on this country.
[00:54:25.248 --> 00:54:30.692]  And the reason I don't care if my father dies or not, because he thinks I belong in jail.
[00:54:30.732 --> 00:54:37.578]  He's one of those old white Baptist Christian males and he still thinks I should be separated from my family.
[00:54:38.078 --> 00:54:39.579]  So I disowned him three years ago.
[00:54:39.599 --> 00:54:47.024]  But the point is, I mean, they're taking your personal comments and things and criticizing hypocrisy as if that's why you have to have your children taken.
[00:54:47.364 --> 00:54:49.186]  Exactly, and that's what we're having to fight.
[00:54:49.206 --> 00:54:52.168]  So this is taking people's children for their political speech.
[00:54:52.388 --> 00:54:52.848]  That's what's going on.
[00:54:52.928 --> 00:54:53.949]  Very dangerous precedent.
[00:54:54.749 --> 00:54:55.730]  Every parent is threatened.
[00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:57.251]  I mean, this is thought crime.
[00:54:57.271 --> 00:54:58.072]  You're a thought criminal.
[00:54:58.092 --> 00:54:58.072]  1984.
[00:54:58.132 --> 00:54:58.452]  Very serious.
[00:55:00.683 --> 00:55:01.403]  Very serious.
[00:55:01.443 --> 00:55:10.888]  You know, Rosa Parks had to stand up on a bus one day to get something changed, and we stood up on a bus trying to prove that these cops actually do commit crimes.
[00:55:11.669 --> 00:55:14.590]  Well, the drugs are brought in to reinstate slavery.
[00:55:14.890 --> 00:55:18.652]  They bring in addictive substances, push the legal ones on the kids at the same time.
[00:55:19.112 --> 00:55:26.236]  They're caught everywhere dealing them, controlling them, stealing the money, and they're the ones that want to keep it illegal, just like the drug dealers we've interviewed want to keep it illegal.
[00:55:26.516 --> 00:55:31.840]  Because they understand it's a black market that makes them all the money, and they're hoping the public doesn't figure this out.
[00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:32.980]  I don't like drugs.
[00:55:33.241 --> 00:55:34.081]  I don't like any of them.
[00:55:34.942 --> 00:55:35.682]  I mean, even coffee.
[00:55:35.722 --> 00:55:36.503]  I can't get off of it.
[00:55:37.564 --> 00:55:39.525]  But the issue is, you shouldn't go to prison for it.
[00:55:39.905 --> 00:55:40.506]  Exactly.
[00:55:40.926 --> 00:55:46.450]  And, you know, we caught a cop committing a felony stealing drug money, and nothing's happened to him.
[00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:48.150]  But we got raided.
[00:55:48.210 --> 00:55:49.611]  And you had HBO with you.
[00:55:49.651 --> 00:55:51.171]  That footage is up on your website.
[00:55:51.212 --> 00:55:53.372]  Tell folks the name of the video and where they can see it.
[00:55:53.592 --> 00:55:55.413]  It's NeverGetBusted.com.
[00:55:55.453 --> 00:56:00.275]  It's a 45 minute video entitled Liberty Hill Finders Keepers.
[00:56:00.875 --> 00:56:04.436]  The whole 45 minute sting is there from beginning to end.
[00:56:06.297 --> 00:56:08.438]  And there you are for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:56:08.858 --> 00:56:13.740]  A clip where you run out with the HBO crew and show what's going on.
[00:56:14.727 --> 00:56:14.787]  Wow.
[00:56:23.407 --> 00:56:25.507]  You mean even after you confronted him?
[00:56:25.527 --> 00:56:26.288]  You did that or before?
[00:56:26.448 --> 00:56:34.409]  No, what we did, I secretly filmed him stealing that money and I held it in my pocket for three months until the HBO film crew could get down here.
[00:56:34.469 --> 00:56:37.470]  Then we went into Liberty Hill to confront that officer.
[00:56:37.490 --> 00:56:38.990]  But that's okay to do that.
[00:56:39.130 --> 00:56:44.151]  It's just, if we catch a kid with a marijuana cigarette, we're gonna throw him into prison that Bubba happens to own.
[00:56:44.171 --> 00:56:46.851]  Yeah, they didn't even catch my kid with a marijuana cigarette.
[00:56:47.071 --> 00:56:47.691]  We'll be right back.
[00:56:47.731 --> 00:56:48.672]  We're on the march.
[00:56:49.112 --> 00:56:50.652]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:56:51.622 --> 00:56:54.383]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:56.884 --> 00:57:00.285]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[00:57:01.125 --> 00:57:02.005]  Tyranny is here.
[00:57:02.385 --> 00:57:06.127]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:57:06.147 --> 00:57:08.507]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:57:08.527 --> 00:57:13.629]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:57:14.389 --> 00:57:20.671]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:57:21.052 --> 00:57:26.614]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:57:27.054 --> 00:57:30.835]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:57:31.235 --> 00:57:35.277]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:57:35.497 --> 00:57:38.318]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies,
[00:57:38.718 --> 00:57:41.120]  Stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:44.422]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:57:45.002 --> 00:57:46.423]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:57:46.983 --> 00:57:47.484]  It's here.

[00:58:26.104 --> 00:58:30.147]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.

[00:58:34.671 --> 00:58:35.492]  Others don't.
[00:58:35.912 --> 00:58:37.813]  We turn jeans inside out.

[00:58:57.335 --> 00:58:59.937]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:59:00.337 --> 00:59:05.300]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:59:05.660 --> 00:59:07.401]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:59:07.721 --> 00:59:12.524]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:59:12.724 --> 00:59:13.685]  How much do you want?
[00:59:13.905 --> 00:59:14.645]  When do you want it?
[00:59:15.025 --> 00:59:16.626]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:59:16.907 --> 00:59:17.727]  When will you need it?
[00:59:17.987 --> 00:59:20.048]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:59:20.188 --> 00:59:21.289]  Will there be any food?
[00:59:21.529 --> 00:59:22.790]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:28.113]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:59:28.293 --> 00:59:31.495]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:59:31.895 --> 00:59:35.397]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:59:35.717 --> 00:59:36.698]  How much will you need?
[00:59:36.938 --> 00:59:37.538]  We don't know.
[00:59:37.838 --> 00:59:38.759]  How much do you want?
[00:59:38.939 --> 00:59:39.679]  All you can get.
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:40.260]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:41.020]  We're good.
[00:59:57.560 --> 01:00:12.138]  But whenever you're persecuted and you stay the course, God
[01:00:13.223 --> 01:00:14.444]  We'll open doors for him.
[01:00:14.464 --> 01:00:17.845]  We're going to talk about some of the exciting things that are happening for you guys right now.
[01:00:17.865 --> 01:00:22.447]  We need to pray for you, pray for your son, your daughter, pray for everybody involved, your ex-husband.
[01:00:22.467 --> 01:00:30.290]  You know, I mean, this whole thing is so terrible, what's happening, and them taking your son because you criticize the government.
[01:00:30.310 --> 01:00:32.471]  I mean, they've really opened themselves up to civil rights lawsuits.
[01:00:32.751 --> 01:00:39.234]  I want to say something about Williamson County and other rural counties that butt up to big cities like Austin.
[01:00:39.314 --> 01:00:40.735]  And we're now a big city, over a million people.
[01:00:42.383 --> 01:00:49.545]  Twenty years ago, even ten years ago, it was mainly cow pasture and some good old boys, and believe me, my family's been down here in this area of Texas for a long time.
[01:00:50.285 --> 01:00:51.986]  The corruption up there was known back then.
[01:00:52.166 --> 01:01:03.929]  You get good old boys in charge, they own the jail, their family gets the contracts, and it's come out with past mayor and police chiefs up in Georgetown with just stuff that will just blow your mind what they're doing.
[01:01:07.205 --> 01:01:25.709]  I predict Williamson County will end up going down in history as one of the most corrupt counties, because as it gets bigger and hundreds of thousands of people move in there, and they feed on all these new people from California and stuff moving in who have no idea, as they keep running this boss hog situation with hundreds of thousands of people under them, they're going to be brought to justice.
[01:01:26.109 --> 01:01:30.990]  And more and more they are being brought to justice, but Williamson County leadership is a cancer.
[01:01:31.810 --> 01:01:32.431]  In this country.
[01:01:32.451 --> 01:01:33.852]  But similar things are going on.
[01:01:33.872 --> 01:01:39.298]  They've got all these CNN specials about where the police just admit in small towns in Texas, they just pull you over, take your money.
[01:01:39.718 --> 01:01:40.719]  You were taught how to do that.
[01:01:40.759 --> 01:01:41.920]  You were taught to plant drugs.
[01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:43.422]  Talking about your father.
[01:01:44.697 --> 01:01:48.858]  Unfortunately, like a lot of the older Christians in this land, their ears are stopped.
[01:01:48.878 --> 01:01:50.419]  My father won't even look at the evidence.
[01:01:50.999 --> 01:01:52.039]  He won't even talk to me about it.
[01:01:52.059 --> 01:01:54.140]  He's a military man and they taught him a certain way.
[01:02:06.764 --> 01:02:08.726]  And by God, that's not going to change.
[01:02:08.766 --> 01:02:15.071]  And unfortunately, that's the attitude a lot of... But doesn't he know why we're having Obamacare and open borders and tyranny?
[01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:16.972]  It's because we are run by crooks.
[01:02:17.633 --> 01:02:21.136]  These mainline good Christian people need to stop living in denial.
[01:02:21.636 --> 01:02:25.979]  Well, they're responsible for all the needless lives being locked up right now.
[01:02:26.059 --> 01:02:27.861]  They've made laws against morals.
[01:02:28.301 --> 01:02:33.926]  The Christians decided if they couldn't behave that way and everybody else was having fun dancing and drinking and
[01:02:34.626 --> 01:02:42.011]  And the CIA narcotics traffickers in the 30s, even before the CIA was set up, they lobbied to have all this done because they'd lost alcohol prohibition.
[01:02:42.131 --> 01:02:49.455]  Well, I actually got kilos of crack cocaine off the street that came directly from the CIA when I was a narcotics officer.
[01:02:50.156 --> 01:02:54.919]  And I was told at the time that that's what it was and I didn't believe it because I was brainwashed too.
[01:02:55.519 --> 01:03:05.361]  And later in years when those documents begin to be revealed, I realized I was seizing cocaine that was put here by our own government and putting non-violent people in jail for that.
[01:03:05.421 --> 01:03:06.202]  And I feel bad.
[01:03:06.222 --> 01:03:07.302]  I feel really bad about that.
[01:03:07.322 --> 01:03:12.083]  That's why I switched sides and produced these videos that teach how not to get busted for pot.
[01:03:12.483 --> 01:03:14.243]  And then we started doing cop busters.
[01:03:14.283 --> 01:03:19.665]  And that's cop busters with a K. You got a lot of courage because I told you a year ago when you were in there, I said, buddy, get ready.
[01:03:19.685 --> 01:03:21.045]  They're coming down on you with both feet.
[01:03:21.585 --> 01:03:22.826]  You did, Alex.
[01:03:22.907 --> 01:03:23.387]  And they did.
[01:03:23.687 --> 01:03:24.268]  And they did.
[01:03:24.308 --> 01:03:25.690]  And they will.
[01:03:27.872 --> 01:03:30.555]  I mean, I'm just telling you that they will try to kill you next.
[01:03:30.575 --> 01:03:31.676]  I mean, you know that.
[01:03:32.036 --> 01:03:32.317]  Yes.
[01:03:32.337 --> 01:03:33.258]  This is big business.
[01:03:33.278 --> 01:03:34.299]  You're not going to cut into that.
[01:03:34.539 --> 01:03:34.819]  Yes.
[01:03:36.881 --> 01:03:39.965]  You know, we've gotten... Did I already talk about the death threats and everything?
[01:03:39.985 --> 01:03:40.065]  Yeah.
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:45.863]  Well, I want to get Bob Chapman's final comments and then shift into other areas and we'll monitor this as it unfolds.
[01:03:46.303 --> 01:03:55.668]  But people should go to your site, they should watch the videos, research it for themselves, and we should also pray for the evil hearts of police that think of us as non-humans.
[01:03:56.068 --> 01:03:58.710]  I mean, I've had police over and over again try to frame me for violence.
[01:03:58.750 --> 01:04:00.251]  I have the national media doing it right now.
[01:04:00.651 --> 01:04:03.853]  I've showed a clip earlier where the military is trying to frame my
[01:04:06.013 --> 01:04:07.374]  You're definitely on the radar.
[01:04:07.414 --> 01:04:09.094]  I'm surprised you haven't been raided.
[01:04:09.134 --> 01:04:10.454]  I'm not sure how you've kept that.
[01:04:27.594 --> 01:04:38.357]  I'm not, my dad always explained to me, he said, and then years after I kind of saw a similar thing at the end of Carlito's Way, it's not the high-level gangsters that kill Carlito, it's the low-level thugs.
[01:04:38.818 --> 01:04:41.839]  My dad, when I first started getting into this, he said, listen, I've studied a lot of history.
[01:04:42.239 --> 01:04:46.220]  He said you can go after Bill Clinton, you can go after big powerful politicians, you can do that.
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:49.021]  He said that when you go after boss hogs, they will kill you.
[01:04:49.721 --> 01:04:51.682]  Because boss hogs you can beat.
[01:04:52.163 --> 01:04:53.723]  The big bankers pretty much don't care.
[01:04:54.244 --> 01:04:57.105]  It's these boss hogs that are dangerous.
[01:04:57.666 --> 01:04:58.866]  See, I thought the opposite.
[01:04:58.906 --> 01:05:03.629]  We thought we were safe just setting stings up for local police because that's what the local people need.
[01:05:03.649 --> 01:05:04.649]  No, that's the most dangerous.
[01:05:05.090 --> 01:05:06.110]  We realize that now.
[01:05:06.130 --> 01:05:14.314]  I mean, if you're a cop trying to investigate Oklahoma City being an inside job and they killed a bunch of cops up in Oklahoma, tortured them to death.
[01:05:14.955 --> 01:05:16.676]  I mean, they don't play games.
[01:05:18.168 --> 01:05:20.949]  This is a $500 billion a year industry of narcotics trafficking.
[01:05:21.149 --> 01:05:25.852]  And as long as the mainline Christians are asleep and sucking their thumbs, the scam can continue.
[01:05:26.352 --> 01:05:31.334]  Well fortunately, you know, Hollywood's caught on and we signed a movie deal with... Yeah, tell folks the positive news.
[01:05:31.354 --> 01:05:33.916]  You've got an NPR special, HBO, TV.
[01:05:33.976 --> 01:05:34.396]  Tell folks.
[01:05:34.696 --> 01:05:45.385]  Yeah, we signed a deal not too long ago with Brett Ratner, the Hollywood giant, who did Prison Break and X-Men and Rush Hours, and they want to do a movie in the theaters about our lives.
[01:05:45.925 --> 01:05:47.206]  And April 8th or 9th?
[01:05:47.226 --> 01:05:48.307]  April 9th.
[01:05:48.568 --> 01:05:52.551]  April 9th, an NPR story will air about them.
[01:05:52.671 --> 01:05:53.692]  It's called This American Life.
[01:05:53.712 --> 01:05:54.793]  That's one of their biggest shows.
[01:05:55.073 --> 01:05:55.333]  Right.
[01:05:55.393 --> 01:05:56.014]  About 4 million.
[01:05:56.514 --> 01:05:56.955]  Yeah, that'll help.
[01:05:56.975 --> 01:05:59.377]  But we were just as excited to be on your show, Alex.
[01:05:59.397 --> 01:06:02.521]  Thanks for reaching out to us because we are just a single family.
[01:06:02.541 --> 01:06:03.802]  We're not a big organization.
[01:06:03.842 --> 01:06:05.724]  We don't even have any full-time employees.
[01:06:06.145 --> 01:06:09.408]  We've done all of this as just activists as a family on our own.
[01:06:09.468 --> 01:06:10.269]  Well, that's the key.
[01:06:10.329 --> 01:06:15.295]  We need more people to do what you've done until there's too many patriots standing up for them to stop us.
[01:06:15.675 --> 01:06:16.516]  Exactly.
[01:06:16.656 --> 01:06:19.398]  And that's one reason they haven't come after me physically yet.
[01:06:19.418 --> 01:06:21.959]  Well, they beat me up once and I get threats and threats on my family.
[01:06:21.979 --> 01:06:25.542]  I mean, a lot of stuff's happened is because we're an idea and ideas are bulletproof.
[01:06:25.562 --> 01:06:28.204]  And we have got millions of people to take action.
[01:06:28.544 --> 01:06:33.207]  And they know if they kill me, it will just make everything I've done that much more evergreen.
[01:06:34.268 --> 01:06:34.808]  Exactly.
[01:06:34.848 --> 01:06:38.010]  Well, still be careful out there because they got Martin Luther King.
[01:06:38.391 --> 01:06:39.511]  Well, I don't think I'm to that level.
[01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:44.501]  You know, he did some great things for his time, and I'm so thankful.
[01:06:44.541 --> 01:06:45.682]  He's one of my heroes.
[01:06:46.702 --> 01:06:50.264]  But this is 2010, and you've certainly carried it to another level.
[01:06:50.944 --> 01:06:52.484]  Well, guys, give the website out again.
[01:06:53.105 --> 01:06:54.725]  NeverGetBusted.com.
[01:06:54.765 --> 01:06:56.266]  Please go there and help us out.
[01:06:56.926 --> 01:07:00.287]  We've got a donate button there for our legal fees.
[01:07:00.808 --> 01:07:04.089]  I asked you about the Texas Rangers, and they won't investigate this.
[01:07:04.189 --> 01:07:19.167]  Texas Rangers announced they won't investigate the Liberty Hill sting, which is not a surprise to me because I have a private clip on YouTube ready to roll where I actually filmed a phone conversation between me and them where they said this, we'll just come to Austin and kick your ass.
[01:07:20.228 --> 01:07:21.269]  And I've got that on film.
[01:07:21.309 --> 01:07:31.802]  They did that over the Yolanda Madden case where we stung the cops in Odessa on a false raid that resulted in Yolanda being released from prison after being there for four years.
[01:07:32.243 --> 01:07:33.364]  She's out of prison now.
[01:07:33.624 --> 01:07:36.127]  Barry, remember me telling you to make copies of all your stuff?
[01:07:36.508 --> 01:07:37.829]  They didn't seize everything you had, did they?
[01:07:38.831 --> 01:07:39.411]  All your videos?
[01:07:39.772 --> 01:07:41.734]  Pretty close, but we've got some backup.
[01:07:41.834 --> 01:07:44.437]  Well, you've now got to put that Texas Ranger clip out.
[01:07:44.878 --> 01:07:48.562]  And I actually didn't keep our videos on site.
[01:07:48.602 --> 01:07:56.312]  We always kept them somewhere else, but I had them in the house because that HBO film crew needed them, and I forgot to return them back to their hiding spots.
[01:07:56.372 --> 01:07:57.874]  Well, there's no doubt they were listening to your phones.
[01:07:59.411 --> 01:07:59.911]  Possibly.
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:17.781]  Stop it, because we're not going to stop exposing corruption.
[01:08:18.441 --> 01:08:23.362]  And how dare you come into my home on a misdemeanor, pointing guns at my family.
[01:08:23.402 --> 01:08:32.725]  If you were civilians and did that, you would have been charged with home invasion, burglary, theft, because you took all of our stuff and you did all that for a misdemeanor that I didn't even commit.
[01:08:33.185 --> 01:08:39.247]  And that's why we've got a $40 million lawsuit coming in your direction, and we're going to get our son back.
[01:08:40.087 --> 01:08:40.707]  I'll die.
[01:08:40.727 --> 01:08:47.390]  I'm non-violent, but I will do everything in my power legally to get our son back.
[01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:48.990]  So, Zach, we're coming to get you, babe.
[01:08:49.050 --> 01:08:49.630]  Right, Candy?
[01:08:49.730 --> 01:08:51.791]  And by saying he'll die, you're ready for him to kill you.
[01:08:52.371 --> 01:08:53.292]  You're ready to go all the way.
[01:08:53.932 --> 01:08:56.973]  Well, I'll use a real Texas Ranger quote from their founder.
[01:08:58.073 --> 01:09:03.435]  A man in the wrong can't stand up against a man who's in the right and keeps on coming.
[01:09:04.115 --> 01:09:04.555]  Thank you.
[01:09:05.136 --> 01:09:05.976]  Guys, good having you in.
[01:09:06.832 --> 01:09:07.773]  Hey Alex, appreciate it.
[01:09:07.793 --> 01:09:08.353]  God bless you.
[01:09:08.373 --> 01:09:08.753]  Yes sir, thanks.
[01:09:08.794 --> 01:09:12.636]  Alright guys, we'll continue to watch this case with Barry and Candy Cooper.
[01:09:12.656 --> 01:09:13.417]  Pray for them folks.
[01:09:13.757 --> 01:09:15.318]  Okay, going back to Bob Chapman.
[01:09:15.338 --> 01:09:16.499]  Bob, thank you for holding during that.
[01:09:16.519 --> 01:09:26.827]  I'm going to give you the floor now on the economy, the police state, all the big developments, but putting in caps on that, Bob Chapman, what's your take on what you just heard?
[01:09:28.268 --> 01:09:35.093]  I want every American out there who heard this program to start doing the same thing in their communities.
[01:09:35.888 --> 01:09:39.892]  With these people who are in law enforcement, who are breaking the law.
[01:09:40.533 --> 01:09:47.219]  And that includes judges and politicians, all of whom feed from the same sewer.
[01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:50.342]  And it's been going on for a long time.
[01:09:50.923 --> 01:09:55.207]  It's a minority, usually, of people within law enforcement.
[01:09:56.348 --> 01:09:58.791]  Most people in law enforcement try to do the right thing.
[01:09:59.642 --> 01:10:01.463]  But, you know, they have the code.
[01:10:01.863 --> 01:10:03.144]  You've got to protect each other.
[01:10:03.164 --> 01:10:06.667]  Well, Whitehurst said it two days ago, former head of the FBI crime lab.
[01:10:06.687 --> 01:10:09.809]  He said, they're good at the bottom, but the sewage is at the top.
[01:10:11.310 --> 01:10:14.592]  Well, it's the same thing in any organization.
[01:10:15.592 --> 01:10:25.599]  And, you know, to have people in law enforcement involved in narcotics, which affect generally, mostly children, is dreadful.
[01:10:26.511 --> 01:10:55.472]  And, you know, we see these things going on all over the country, and I think what happens to a lot of these men, especially those who are in higher positions that have been in law enforcement for a number of years, they just get hardened to everything, and they are dealing with criminals for years, and they adapt some of the same approach to life as criminals do, because they're so exposed to them.
[01:10:56.497 --> 01:10:58.879]  And I'm not trying to make excuses for them, but it happens.
[01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:10.348]  It's just like when someone's kidnapped, they find a relationship with the kidnapper so that they can handle it.
[01:11:10.828 --> 01:11:12.089]  The Stockholm Syndrome!
[01:11:13.610 --> 01:11:14.111]  That's right.
[01:11:14.671 --> 01:11:22.477]  And, you know, one of the things I want to mention here is a comment of the OSS during the 1930s being involved with narcotics.
[01:11:25.789 --> 01:11:35.971]  And they were taught how to do that by MITechs, who had been involved for many, many, many years in narcotics going back into the Middle Ages.
[01:11:35.991 --> 01:11:40.553]  Yeah, back to the private Crown Chartered British East India Company.
[01:11:40.853 --> 01:11:44.353]  That was the first private intelligence operatives in Europe.
[01:11:46.134 --> 01:11:50.995]  And then they branched out when they took India, and then they had the giant
[01:11:52.194 --> 01:11:58.177]  Uh, heroin trade going into China, which they had taken possession of.
[01:11:59.337 --> 01:12:07.481]  And most of those shippers who were doing the shipping for them were families from New England and New York who were in the shipping business.
[01:12:08.201 --> 01:12:18.286]  And many of the great fortunes that exist on the East Coast today came from running heroin from India to China for the British.
[01:12:18.766 --> 01:12:20.127]  And that's well documented.
[01:12:21.461 --> 01:12:30.705]  I think people should understand as well that the Central Intelligence Agency, people within that agency, are deeply involved in this thing.
[01:12:31.165 --> 01:12:35.327]  Books have been written for the last 25 or 30 years about the subject.
[01:12:36.108 --> 01:12:48.173]  And there are many, many people who are highly placed in government and close to government who have never been apprehended for what they've done, who have been deeply involved in this.
[01:12:48.873 --> 01:12:50.574]  I'm not going to go in detail on it.
[01:12:51.092 --> 01:12:53.454]  But you see what's going on in the Mexican border.
[01:12:54.794 --> 01:12:59.237]  This is a fight which involves the U.S.
[01:12:59.277 --> 01:13:04.360]  government via the CIA and the Mexican government to take over the drug trade.
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:05.421]  This is what it's all about.
[01:13:07.542 --> 01:13:13.846]  And the drug trade is saying, uh-uh, we're not going to let you do that because you're just as big criminals as we are.
[01:13:14.407 --> 01:13:16.288]  So if you want it, you're going to have to fight for it.
[01:13:17.603 --> 01:13:20.925]  And that's what that's all about, and I thought I'd let people know that.
[01:13:21.765 --> 01:13:26.587]  Because our government, the United States, is unbelievably corrupt.
[01:13:27.428 --> 01:13:32.070]  Far worse than anything you could imagine in any country for many, many years.
[01:13:34.131 --> 01:13:38.113]  Bob, shifting gears into the economy, you're our expert on that.
[01:13:38.873 --> 01:13:41.695]  What concerns you most with what's happening in the economy right now?
[01:13:43.956 --> 01:13:46.637]  Well, I think that the sovereign debt problem
[01:13:47.515 --> 01:13:52.437]  There's 19 countries that are bankrupt, and that includes the United States and Great Britain.
[01:13:53.557 --> 01:13:56.738]  And I think they're going to have to wind this thing down.
[01:13:57.358 --> 01:14:04.581]  They are using the injection of money and credit into the economy, not only here, but the G20 countries as well.
[01:14:05.021 --> 01:14:06.142]  These are the big countries.
[01:14:06.902 --> 01:14:11.243]  And they have used stimulus in each country.
[01:14:11.423 --> 01:14:12.784]  The stimulus is running out.
[01:14:14.224 --> 01:14:15.745]  This month will be the last month.
[01:14:17.003 --> 01:14:20.005]  The money and credit has been withdrawn to some extent.
[01:14:21.706 --> 01:14:36.496]  If they do not continue, they, the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the central banks in these major countries, if they don't continue to inject money into the system, one way or another, the system is going to collapse.
[01:14:37.957 --> 01:14:46.203]  And I've said from the very beginning, this didn't happen because there was incompetence or greed.
[01:14:46.909 --> 01:14:48.270]  This was planned this way.
[01:14:49.351 --> 01:14:55.615]  And so, we don't know when they're going to pull the plug and create deflationary depression.
[01:14:56.136 --> 01:14:56.836]  But it's coming.
[01:14:57.316 --> 01:14:58.757]  And it could come very quickly.
[01:14:59.638 --> 01:15:02.960]  I'm looking at about a year and a half, maybe two years.
[01:15:03.941 --> 01:15:07.704]  And they're going to have to pull the plug because they can't control it anymore.
[01:15:08.244 --> 01:15:10.946]  And they've passed the point of no return.
[01:15:11.326 --> 01:15:12.407]  They cannot go back.
[01:15:12.967 --> 01:15:15.169]  And believe me, they're terrified.
[01:15:16.030 --> 01:15:16.390]  And we have
[01:15:17.065 --> 01:15:26.867]  Prove positive of that, of the way that they've gone after people like yourself, and of course me for many years, and they're gonna go after other people.
[01:15:27.487 --> 01:15:39.650]  And anybody that exposes the crimes that they're involved in, whether it's narcotics, or pedophilia, or white slavery, all of these things which they're involved in,
[01:15:42.063 --> 01:15:43.866]  Anybody is going to get a lot of heat.
[01:15:44.327 --> 01:15:45.689]  Bob, let's break this down, though.
[01:15:45.709 --> 01:15:51.117]  When the heat is created, Alex, it shows you that we're being very effective.
[01:15:52.338 --> 01:16:04.805]  But as the IMF and World Bank documents from 2002 state, as other reports from inside the system admit, they created the derivatives bubble, they intended to implode the economy, but now you're saying they're scared.
[01:16:04.825 --> 01:16:07.187]  I mean, has it gotten out of hand for them?
[01:16:07.447 --> 01:16:12.470]  I mean, if they set all this up, and we know they did, then why are you saying they're panicking and scared?
[01:16:14.331 --> 01:16:15.071]  Because they are.
[01:16:15.091 --> 01:16:18.293]  I don't think they want to go through with it, but they have to.
[01:16:19.119 --> 01:16:23.341]  And so they're trying to devise when they can do it with the least amount of heat.
[01:16:23.861 --> 01:16:24.941]  Now you've seen Greece.
[01:16:25.262 --> 01:16:27.722]  Greece is bankrupt, has been for 10 years or more.
[01:16:28.543 --> 01:16:32.865]  And so they brought it up deliberately to see what the reaction was.
[01:16:33.345 --> 01:16:41.248]  And what they intend to do is to take all the countries that are bankrupt, and there'll be 19 of them, I can assure you.
[01:16:42.588 --> 01:16:44.229]  They're going to bring them all down together.
[01:16:45.049 --> 01:16:48.791]  And that's why I've said in the program before, they're going to have a meeting just like
[01:16:49.386 --> 01:17:05.513]  The meetings that were held in the 1970s called Smithsonian, and the Plaza Accord, and the Louvre Accord, they all get together, they devalue all the currencies, and they default on the debt, and they have a deflationary depression, and a war at the same time.
[01:17:06.033 --> 01:17:12.295]  And that's what they're up to, and that's where they're headed, and we're exposing it, and they don't like it, and that's why we're getting heat.
[01:17:12.736 --> 01:17:15.997]  And believe me, if they knew where I was, I wouldn't be around.
[01:17:17.790 --> 01:17:20.812]  That's right, you had to leave the United States, what, a decade ago?
[01:17:20.832 --> 01:17:23.893]  No, it was seven years ago, the last time.
[01:17:24.353 --> 01:17:25.614]  But that's not the first time.
[01:17:26.374 --> 01:17:27.775]  It started in the 1960s.
[01:17:28.155 --> 01:17:36.760]  Yeah, for those who don't know, Bob has been there from the very beginning of the True Patriot movement against tyranny.
[01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:38.601]  I want to talk with him about militias.
[01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:40.622]  We support the militias.
[01:17:40.642 --> 01:17:43.886]  We're all in the militia, as men, 18 to 45.
[01:17:43.926 --> 01:17:47.591]  But we want to explain how they're setting militias up.
[01:17:47.911 --> 01:17:51.516]  Some of the Fed-run militias then get mad and say, I'm criticizing militias.
[01:17:51.556 --> 01:17:53.439]  No, we're warning militias.
[01:17:53.639 --> 01:17:54.220]  We'll be right back.
[01:17:58.166 --> 01:18:05.208]  Attention landscapers, house painters, carpet cleaners, pet sitters, gutter cleaners, and anyone who has their own home service business.
[01:18:05.448 --> 01:18:08.669]  Would you love to build a huge and loyal customer base fast?

[01:18:29.436 --> 01:18:34.198]  Corporate America is destroying our country and it's time to rebuild the backbone of America.

[01:18:58.088 --> 01:19:00.389]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:19:00.409 --> 01:19:02.650]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:19:02.670 --> 01:19:05.571]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:19:05.991 --> 01:19:10.733]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:19:11.093 --> 01:19:15.295]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:19:15.595 --> 01:19:17.957]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:19:18.057 --> 01:19:20.478]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:19:20.498 --> 01:19:23.420]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:31.345]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:19:31.685 --> 01:19:36.969]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:19:37.050 --> 01:19:39.351]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:19:39.391 --> 01:19:43.355]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:19:43.615 --> 01:19:44.536]  And I got news for you.
[01:19:44.696 --> 01:19:45.997]  You're everyone else.

[01:19:57.662 --> 01:19:58.202]  You worry.
[01:19:58.583 --> 01:20:00.304]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[01:20:00.604 --> 01:20:02.826]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[01:20:03.146 --> 01:20:04.967]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[01:20:05.248 --> 01:20:06.449]  Your answer may be at hand.
[01:20:06.849 --> 01:20:10.051]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[01:20:10.452 --> 01:20:15.315]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[01:20:15.675 --> 01:20:19.018]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[01:20:19.498 --> 01:20:20.839]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[01:20:21.179 --> 01:20:23.781]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[01:20:24.042 --> 01:20:26.984]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[01:20:27.344 --> 01:20:35.489]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[01:20:35.769 --> 01:20:40.172]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.

[01:20:53.561 --> 01:20:55.582]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[01:21:08.493 --> 01:21:12.276]  Bob Chapman is our guest at TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[01:21:12.316 --> 01:21:15.458]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:21:15.939 --> 01:21:29.249]  We've got the two new trailers we premiered last hour for Police Day 4, The Rise of FEMA and A Sneak Peek, and the Invisible Empire trailer, The Best Yet, up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now throughout the weekend.
[01:21:29.269 --> 01:21:37.154]  If you're listening to rebroadcast, be sure and check it out as we expose these criminals and destroy their credibility, which is key to getting our country back.
[01:21:38.044 --> 01:21:41.710]  As our founding fathers did for more than a decade before we took the nation back.
[01:21:41.971 --> 01:21:42.872]  It was an info war.
[01:21:43.593 --> 01:21:49.964]  Bob Chapman, speaking of info war, militias are incredibly infiltrated.
[01:21:50.004 --> 01:21:51.166]  We support the militia.
[01:21:51.206 --> 01:21:52.087]  It's constitutional.
[01:21:52.932 --> 01:21:57.935]  But I've noticed that Fed-run militias always attack me when I warn other militias they're being set up.
[01:21:58.315 --> 01:22:03.499]  I warned Hatari in August of last year and got attacked for it, saying they're getting ready to set you up.
[01:22:04.259 --> 01:22:08.482]  Out of 400 militias that are public, I called it right because I could see what was happening.
[01:22:10.743 --> 01:22:17.007]  Explain to people going into this month of April your take on how they're going to try to provocateur, or if you agree with me.
[01:22:18.908 --> 01:22:21.230]  They've used this for years.
[01:22:21.909 --> 01:22:25.150]  You can go back into the 1960s with the Minutemen.
[01:22:25.770 --> 01:22:29.371]  I mean, how many people have even heard of the Minutemen?
[01:22:30.371 --> 01:22:34.272]  It was a very large, strong organization throughout the United States.
[01:22:34.932 --> 01:22:43.554]  Sort of a more militant type of pro-American patriot movement than the John Birch Society was, which is more into education.
[01:22:44.435 --> 01:22:47.255]  And they infiltrated like mad.
[01:22:48.195 --> 01:22:50.116]  And it happened at every level.
[01:22:51.178 --> 01:22:53.879]  And so you had to be very careful what you said and what you did.
[01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:56.160]  And they're still doing it today.
[01:22:56.180 --> 01:23:03.943]  I mean, I had people from the federal government try to plant grenades in my garage.
[01:23:05.184 --> 01:23:06.565]  And fortunately, I caught them.
[01:23:07.605 --> 01:23:09.886]  And I told them if they came back, I'd kill them.
[01:23:11.106 --> 01:23:13.107]  And fortunately, they didn't come back.
[01:23:13.487 --> 01:23:16.369]  And I put up with this sort of thing for years.
[01:23:16.389 --> 01:23:19.350]  So you've got to be very careful who you're dealing with.
[01:23:19.932 --> 01:23:33.259]  Bob, I learned this 14 years ago when I would warn militia people or catch fake militias lying about me, that the Fed run militias, when you warn other militias, they attack you and you're not supposed to warn militias about infiltration.
[01:23:33.699 --> 01:23:35.380]  That is 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[01:23:36.300 --> 01:23:45.005]  Anybody attacking me for warning militias and saying I'm attacking militias and telling lies, obviously they are super suspect.
[01:23:45.025 --> 01:23:45.525]  Do you agree?
[01:23:46.606 --> 01:23:47.246]  Absolutely.
[01:23:48.134 --> 01:23:49.094]  You know, I've seen it.
[01:23:49.494 --> 01:23:50.394]  I've gone through it.
[01:23:51.335 --> 01:23:58.716]  I've had people for government go to people who I knew very well and threatened to put them in jail unless they set me up.
[01:23:59.636 --> 01:24:05.817]  And they would say to the... and this happened several times... that, you don't scare me, he does.
[01:24:08.298 --> 01:24:09.758]  And they went away and didn't come back.
[01:24:13.338 --> 01:24:16.059]  Why do you think out of so many people they got a particular
[01:24:18.410 --> 01:24:19.610]  Well, you know the word for you.
[01:24:21.311 --> 01:24:24.332]  Because I work with the government, they train me, they figure they own me.
[01:24:25.033 --> 01:24:29.274]  That's the psychological profile of these people.
[01:24:29.314 --> 01:24:33.396]  How dare he go off and tell people the truth about what we're doing?
[01:24:33.996 --> 01:24:35.437]  He's supposed to do what we're doing!
[01:24:37.818 --> 01:24:40.999]  How long off and on did you work for different intelligence agencies?
[01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:43.420]  About five years.
[01:24:44.608 --> 01:24:48.910]  I'll tell you something very interesting, and I won't tell you who the character is, but everybody knows him.
[01:24:49.570 --> 01:24:55.152]  I met him one time, went in his office, and they wanted to do a business deal.
[01:24:55.932 --> 01:25:04.195]  And I flew into where he was, outside Washington, and he was reading my file from the Central Intelligence Agency.
[01:25:04.976 --> 01:25:10.178]  And I said, well, gee, you must know all about me by now, because I hadn't known him before.
[01:25:11.078 --> 01:25:13.019]  And he said, yeah, yeah.
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:16.541]  Uh, you know, you should be working with us.
[01:25:17.361 --> 01:25:18.382]  And I said, oh, really?
[01:25:19.042 --> 01:25:21.543]  I said, I just finished reading the book Compromised.
[01:25:22.063 --> 01:25:22.704]  Have you read it?
[01:25:23.624 --> 01:25:27.446]  And he said, uh, he said, well, I don't want to talk about that.
[01:25:27.506 --> 01:25:28.926]  Let's just talk about business.
[01:25:30.067 --> 01:25:35.169]  And so these people around and in government, some from the military... Stay there, got a break.
[01:25:35.209 --> 01:25:35.649]  Stay there.
[01:25:35.669 --> 01:25:40.672]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:26:50.152 --> 01:26:52.072]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:26:52.533 --> 01:26:55.274]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:27:04.910 --> 01:27:12.456]  So, Bob Chapman, I can't say on air what TV network the person works for that you were just mentioning, can I?
[01:27:14.398 --> 01:27:15.839]  I don't think you should.
[01:27:15.859 --> 01:27:16.280]  They know.
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:18.301]  They monitor all these programs.
[01:27:19.042 --> 01:27:22.385]  They just get more mad and try to figure out what to do about it.
[01:27:24.306 --> 01:27:27.309]  But these people aren't going to go away, and we're not going to go away either.
[01:27:28.406 --> 01:27:32.829]  And we're just going to keep on doing what we're doing, which is waking people up to the truth.
[01:27:33.410 --> 01:27:41.255]  And it'll all fall in place, and if we don't do a good enough job, he'll step in, the Lord, and he'll help us, just like you said earlier.
[01:27:42.136 --> 01:27:45.338]  So let's just keep on doing what we're doing, but you're going to help us out there.
[01:27:46.897 --> 01:27:50.559]  Especially how people like the gentleman and his wife who are just on here.
[01:27:51.019 --> 01:27:52.680]  It's incredible what they're going through.
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.802]  And I'm sure these sort of things are going on throughout the country.
[01:27:57.562 --> 01:27:58.743]  And we can't have that.
[01:27:59.203 --> 01:28:02.124]  I see reports every day that dwarf even that.
[01:28:02.164 --> 01:28:04.045]  It's just I know these people.
[01:28:04.485 --> 01:28:05.466]  It's happening all around us.
[01:28:05.806 --> 01:28:09.708]  For the average person in government, though, who's even involved in corruption, they're compartmentalized.
[01:28:09.748 --> 01:28:11.208]  They don't get the big picture.
[01:28:11.228 --> 01:28:11.949]  They haven't studied it.
[01:28:12.429 --> 01:28:16.972]  I mean, now the government's openly announcing every week they're going to start taking pension funds.
[01:28:17.492 --> 01:28:21.394]  I mean, that's now what the good guys do, and they're going to use Homeland Security to make sure it happens?
[01:28:21.434 --> 01:28:23.435]  I mean, this is pure evil.
[01:28:23.495 --> 01:28:25.236]  They've thrown their lot in with pure evil.
[01:28:25.576 --> 01:28:31.880]  It's not too late for a lot of these guys that work for evil to make the decision to join the Patriots.
[01:28:33.861 --> 01:28:34.381]  An exit.
[01:28:35.982 --> 01:28:37.443]  And, you know, that's where they get them.
[01:28:37.463 --> 01:28:40.665]  They need to make a living, and of course the economy's terrible.
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:43.541]  And if you leave your post, where are you going to work?
[01:28:44.221 --> 01:28:47.942]  They're not even hiring garbage collectors.
[01:28:48.762 --> 01:28:50.842]  It's bad out there, and it's going to get a lot worse.
[01:28:51.463 --> 01:28:53.363]  And so these people, a lot of them are trapped.
[01:28:54.383 --> 01:28:55.704]  They say, well, I don't want to do that.
[01:28:55.744 --> 01:28:57.124]  Well, if you don't, you're out of here.
[01:28:58.284 --> 01:29:02.905]  Just like the policemen, they say, look, you're going to write 40 tickets a month.
[01:29:03.746 --> 01:29:04.486]  And that's the end of it.
[01:29:04.986 --> 01:29:05.446]  If you don't,
[01:29:06.447 --> 01:29:09.709]  You know, you're going to either be demoted, or we're going to replace you.
[01:29:09.749 --> 01:29:13.672]  And then they lie about it and say there aren't quotas, but now they admit there's quotas.
[01:29:14.892 --> 01:29:15.313]  Finally.
[01:29:16.113 --> 01:29:18.014]  After, you know, what, a hundred years?
[01:29:18.034 --> 01:29:22.637]  The United States are really dreadful.
[01:29:22.997 --> 01:29:26.400]  And I got a letter today from someone who lived in New Jersey.
[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:28.541]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:29:28.561 --> 01:29:31.683]  I mean, they need to raise revenue so badly.
[01:29:33.833 --> 01:29:40.410]  It doesn't matter whether you break the law or infractions, they're going to pull you over anyway because they need the money.
[01:29:41.104 --> 01:29:48.230]  Well, that's what Robin Hood went through, and that's what all of our ancestors, regardless of what color you are or where you came from, this is the old fight.
[01:29:48.530 --> 01:29:58.018]  You get corrupt government, it gets filled with criminals, they start robbing everybody, and there's no doubt we've got a really bad brand of tyranny taking over the West.
[01:29:58.178 --> 01:29:59.660]  But the people are waking up.
[01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:03.022]  Dr. Frederick Whitehurst thinks things are better now than they were a decade ago.
[01:30:03.383 --> 01:30:06.886]  We just now know things are bad, so it seems like it's worse.
[01:30:06.946 --> 01:30:08.827]  He thinks the tide is starting to turn.
[01:30:08.847 --> 01:30:09.268]  Do you agree?
[01:30:10.646 --> 01:30:11.106]  Don't know.
[01:30:11.126 --> 01:30:16.671]  I hope he's right, but I never do things on hope.
[01:30:17.731 --> 01:30:35.344]  I always try to deal with the cold, hard facts that I can see, and what I might be able to back into, knowing the only way you can understand these people, particularly at the upper levels, is understanding the very sophisticated criminal mind.
[01:30:35.945 --> 01:30:37.206]  And if you can understand
[01:30:38.419 --> 01:30:42.020]  You know, the next thing that this criminal is going to do, you can stop him.
[01:30:42.780 --> 01:30:45.920]  And we know what they're going to do, the invisible government.
[01:30:47.621 --> 01:30:50.821]  Right there, you've got it right there in the DVD.
[01:30:51.901 --> 01:30:56.242]  That's what we're going to get out to people so they can better understand what they're dealing with.
[01:30:56.522 --> 01:31:00.363]  People in $4,000 suits running around robbing the world.
[01:31:01.743 --> 01:31:06.364]  Do you agree that they're going to stage events very, very soon to be blind on the Tea Party?
[01:31:08.041 --> 01:31:10.482]  Yes, and it just won't be the tea party.
[01:31:10.502 --> 01:31:11.643]  It'll be all over the place.
[01:31:11.703 --> 01:31:13.944]  And they don't have to be major events.
[01:31:14.004 --> 01:31:15.324]  They can be small ones.
[01:31:16.005 --> 01:31:18.846]  They want to keep people's minds in turmoil.
[01:31:19.246 --> 01:31:20.787]  That's why they create these wars.
[01:31:21.688 --> 01:31:31.072]  People don't worry about economics and finance if they think their three boys who are over in Afghanistan, Iraq, and, say, Haiti, are going to get killed tomorrow morning.
[01:31:32.625 --> 01:31:35.049]  They're more concerned about that, and that's why they have these wars.
[01:31:35.109 --> 01:31:36.752]  Of course, they want to get rid of people, too.
[01:31:37.293 --> 01:31:43.402]  And they want to destroy the economy so that everybody's too busy trying to pay the rent and pay the car payment and the insurance payment.
[01:31:44.574 --> 01:31:46.955]  Or fighting off the CPS to stand up against corruption.
[01:31:47.255 --> 01:31:48.576]  Bob, thanks for spending time with us.
[01:31:48.596 --> 01:31:50.157]  TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[01:31:50.357 --> 01:31:51.457]  We'll see you again next Friday.
[01:31:51.477 --> 01:31:52.018]  God bless you.
[01:31:52.798 --> 01:31:53.238]  You got it.
[01:31:53.278 --> 01:31:54.659]  Thank you all for listening.
[01:31:54.679 --> 01:31:55.079]  You bet.
[01:31:55.299 --> 01:31:56.340]  Dan Winter's coming up.
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.301]  They helped to create a new world order.
[01:31:59.401 --> 01:32:01.582]  We are part of a new world order.
[01:32:01.702 --> 01:32:04.423]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[01:32:04.904 --> 01:32:09.666]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:32:10.026 --> 01:32:14.208]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:32:14.528 --> 01:32:16.871]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:32:16.891 --> 01:32:19.415]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:32:19.755 --> 01:32:22.319]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:32:22.679 --> 01:32:30.270]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:32:30.598 --> 01:32:35.880]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:38.260]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:42.261]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:32:42.521 --> 01:32:43.462]  And I got news for you.
[01:32:43.602 --> 01:32:44.922]  You're everyone else.
[01:32:44.942 --> 01:32:45.942]  Invisible Empire.

[01:32:56.906 --> 01:32:58.168]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:58.228 --> 01:33:03.554]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:33:03.814 --> 01:33:08.440]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:33:08.841 --> 01:33:13.867]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:33:14.387 --> 01:33:19.090]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:33:19.611 --> 01:33:21.552]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:33:21.932 --> 01:33:26.535]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:33:26.735 --> 01:33:27.636]  And here's the best part.
[01:33:27.856 --> 01:33:30.618]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:33:30.918 --> 01:33:34.220]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:33:34.540 --> 01:33:37.361]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:33:37.721 --> 01:33:39.602]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:33:39.942 --> 01:33:40.862]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:33:40.882 --> 01:33:41.263]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:33:41.283 --> 01:33:44.024]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:33:44.524 --> 01:33:46.264]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:33:56.767 --> 01:34:01.991]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:34:02.011 --> 01:34:04.793]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:34:04.813 --> 01:34:09.277]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:34:10.157 --> 01:34:14.601]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from infowars.com.

[01:34:44.584 --> 01:34:45.324]  Shadow Government.
[01:34:45.985 --> 01:34:47.405]  It gives Big Brother a black eye.
[01:34:48.206 --> 01:34:53.308]  Available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:34:54.488 --> 01:35:00.711]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:35:01.291 --> 01:35:04.033]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:35:06.741 --> 01:35:13.504]  A couple months ago, Texas Monthly, I guess three or four now, called me, did an in-depth interview.
[01:35:13.524 --> 01:35:17.827]  I thought it was going to be a bad hit piece, because mainstream media always does hit pieces, but it was pretty fair.
[01:35:17.967 --> 01:35:19.848]  I mean, I'd say 80% accurate.
[01:35:21.108 --> 01:35:31.173]  And I'd actually interviewed the reporter who exposed Thule, a Texas drug dealing, and how they had right at half the black population of the town in the jail owned by the local boss hog, and they were planting drugs on him.
[01:35:32.414 --> 01:35:33.535]  And it was Nate Blakeslee.
[01:35:34.375 --> 01:35:38.999]  And then they said, yeah, we've got Dan Winters doing the photo shoot.
[01:35:39.099 --> 01:35:45.985]  And I don't, I mean, I like photography, but I'm not a photography expert or a photography buff.
[01:35:46.005 --> 01:35:51.790]  But I knew the name Dan Winters because he's in the top two or three, four reporters, not just in the U.S., but in the world.
[01:35:51.850 --> 01:35:53.331]  Time Magazine, Newsweek.
[01:35:53.852 --> 01:35:54.572]  I mean, you name it.
[01:35:54.932 --> 01:35:56.414]  This guy has photographed.
[01:35:56.874 --> 01:36:03.299]  You know, all the top politicians, all the top writers, all the top spiritual leaders, Hollywood folks, Brad Pitt, you name it.
[01:36:03.559 --> 01:36:06.481]  We're going to be showing some of those images for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:36:06.742 --> 01:36:12.466]  For radio listeners, they can go to danwinnersphoto.com and look at some of these.
[01:36:13.166 --> 01:36:17.009]  And so, I mean, I don't know who top photographers are, but I knew who Dan Winters was.
[01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:22.473]  And then he built a whole stage, a whole set for me out in his place out in the Texas Hill Country.
[01:36:22.894 --> 01:36:25.516]  And then he was telling me, in between the shoots,
[01:36:26.923 --> 01:36:31.245]  You know, all these wild stories about different politicians or people he refused to photograph.
[01:36:31.685 --> 01:36:35.707]  And so he's here until the end of the show, end of the hour.
[01:36:36.368 --> 01:36:38.689]  And so we're very, very honored to have him here.
[01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:46.013]  Weatherstan Winters began his career in photography as a photojournalist in his hometown in Ventura County, California, widely recognized for his celebrity
[01:36:46.733 --> 01:36:49.656]  Portraits, scientific photography, and photojournalistic stories.
[01:36:50.076 --> 01:36:52.638]  He's won over 100 national and international awards.
[01:36:53.319 --> 01:37:01.446]  His wide range of publications and clients include Esquire, Forge Entertainment Weekly, Texas Monthly, Rolling Stone, Nike, Microsoft, Warner Brothers, and Sony.
[01:37:02.206 --> 01:37:09.012]  And in 2003, Dan was honored by Kodak as photo icon in their Biographical Legends series.
[01:37:09.072 --> 01:37:12.315]  So he is a photography icon, and he is here with us.
[01:37:12.355 --> 01:37:13.116]  Dan, thanks for being here.
[01:37:13.556 --> 01:37:14.296]  Good to see you, Alex.
[01:37:14.336 --> 01:37:14.817]  Good to see you.
[01:37:15.077 --> 01:37:15.457]  You bet.
[01:37:17.198 --> 01:37:23.960]  Last time it was under totally different circumstances, but I'm at the receiving end of the sharp stick now, rather than you, so it's good to be here.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.621]  Well, I tell you, you did an amazing job.
[01:37:25.681 --> 01:37:27.162]  I mean, yeah, I was pretty thrilled.
[01:37:27.182 --> 01:37:28.262]  These are some incredible photos.
[01:37:28.302 --> 01:37:30.783]  In fact, we'll put some of the photos he took of me up there and then some of the others.
[01:37:31.684 --> 01:37:32.164]  You're here.
[01:37:32.204 --> 01:37:33.164]  I appreciate you coming in.
[01:37:33.184 --> 01:37:35.005]  I mean, you're on the Big Conspiracy Theorist Show.
[01:37:35.285 --> 01:37:37.146]  Yeah, that's good, that's good.
[01:37:37.166 --> 01:37:45.871]  You know, the thing about you and the thing about what you do and what you guys do, I think, is that, you know, it's more than a full-time job to keep track of all this stuff.
[01:37:46.071 --> 01:37:55.517]  And so, you know, the normal Joe goes to work, he comes home from work, he kicks back, he has his beer, he watches Fox News, he doesn't have time to pay attention to this stuff.
[01:37:55.577 --> 01:38:00.760]  And so I've always admired people, regardless of where their position was, that kind of really pay attention to this stuff.
[01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:19.973]  And, you know, I've done, I've dabbled in it, you know, and I think the most kind of almost one of the most sort of insulting or at least kind of patronizing sort of responses that that people give me whenever I talk about these issues is, you know, instantly that you're like demoted to, oh, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[01:38:20.473 --> 01:38:39.413]  Rather than having like an open-minded conversation about something that you've looked into it's like you know I looked into you know flight 93 for example you know I became curious I'm interested in aerospace I heard some of the reports well you know they were making cell phone calls and this and that and I'm like well you know the infrastructure for a cell phone call from 30,000 feet isn't in place and it's
[01:38:39.853 --> 01:38:41.453]  You know, I have no idea what happened.
[01:38:41.513 --> 01:38:44.954]  It's neither here nor there, but I question it from like a scientific standpoint.
[01:38:44.974 --> 01:38:46.554]  Like, well, how did that happen?
[01:38:46.594 --> 01:38:53.616]  You know, so I start researching that and I start researching like capabilities in the Eastern Corridor, altitudes that cell phone signals will reach, etc, etc.
[01:38:54.076 --> 01:39:02.758]  And it like doesn't make sense, you know, and then there's all these cell phone or communications experts and technicians and, you know, electronics technicians that you can find online that are saying like,
[01:39:03.258 --> 01:39:08.259]  Hey, you know, it's neither here nor there, but I can tell you right now that no one made a cell phone call from 30,000 people.
[01:39:08.279 --> 01:39:14.460]  And it came out last year in FBI documents that the Solicitor General had never got a call from his wife and didn't talk to her.
[01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:14.900]  Interesting.
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:15.920]  The FBI admitted that.
[01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:17.200]  It came out two weeks ago.
[01:39:18.181 --> 01:39:23.982]  The ACLU sued and got the documents where Cheney ordered the commission not to look at the attacks, and it was a cover-up.
[01:39:24.002 --> 01:39:26.462]  We have six of the ten commissioners saying it's a criminal cover-up.
[01:39:26.722 --> 01:39:27.382]  John Farmer.
[01:39:27.582 --> 01:39:29.883]  But then we're not supposed to even ask questions as citizens.
[01:39:29.963 --> 01:39:30.123]  I know.
[01:39:30.283 --> 01:39:31.683]  We're supposed to sit down and shut up.
[01:39:31.823 --> 01:39:50.193]  Well you know you look at it too and you look at the evidence and you look oftentimes what happens is with any crime scene is you know the first responders are the only ones that get any imagery after that it's completely closed off so they made this like ridiculous airplane shaped pit in the ground that had some smoldering embers almost like they put some
[01:39:50.453 --> 01:39:50.653]  Yes.
[01:40:07.766 --> 01:40:11.349]  Uh, to please the media with, you know, some sort of, like, visual.
[01:40:11.949 --> 01:40:23.077]  And there was this ridiculous diagram that came out that I saw that I wish I had actually brought, that was the official FBI version of how the crash took place and what happened.
[01:40:23.138 --> 01:40:30.483]  And so, basically, what they said is the airplane came down in a straight dive, hit the ground, and the entire plane went under the ground.
[01:40:30.783 --> 01:40:32.305]  And they had a diagram they'd drawn.
[01:40:32.325 --> 01:40:36.789]  Meanwhile, separately, the state police said an 8-mile debris field, engines 5 miles away.
[01:40:36.809 --> 01:40:37.730]  I know, I know.
[01:40:37.810 --> 01:40:43.877]  Which indicates high altitude, you know, catastrophic failure at high altitude, which indicates a missile, obviously.
[01:40:44.297 --> 01:40:47.260]  You know, it's kind of like, it's the most ridiculous thing.
[01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:51.104]  And once again, you know, my friends instantly, you know, they're like, well, what do you think happened?
[01:40:51.124 --> 01:40:51.785]  What do you think this?
[01:40:51.805 --> 01:40:52.445]  What do you think that?
[01:40:52.886 --> 01:40:53.586]  And I'm like, you know, look.
[01:40:54.227 --> 01:40:54.687]  I don't know.
[01:40:55.127 --> 01:40:56.368]  I don't know why.
[01:40:56.388 --> 01:40:57.148]  I don't know how.
[01:40:57.568 --> 01:41:01.090]  I can tell you, though, that that aircraft didn't hit the ground in one piece.
[01:41:01.310 --> 01:41:05.891]  Because, obviously, you know, an engine isn't going to end up five miles away from a crash site.
[01:41:05.911 --> 01:41:17.595]  You can look at, you know, crash site after crash site after crash site that, you know, that's been investigated by the F.B.A., that's widely photographed, and when a plane, you know, breaks up at altitude, the debris flew, you know, Flight 111 over, you know, in New... Lockerbie.
[01:41:22.077 --> 01:41:26.686]  No, no, that was 111 was the one in Nova Scotia.
[01:41:26.726 --> 01:41:30.693]  Well, we know debris fields, even when they crash into mountains or fields.
[01:41:31.877 --> 01:41:33.538]  Normally hundreds and hundreds of yards long.
[01:41:33.618 --> 01:41:34.119]  Absolutely.
[01:41:34.199 --> 01:41:36.100]  Contained, reasonably contained, right?
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:39.342]  But at altitude, the Lockerbie one, how big was the debris field there?
[01:41:39.422 --> 01:41:39.863]  Massive.
[01:41:39.963 --> 01:41:40.203]  Yes.
[01:41:40.343 --> 01:41:42.104]  High altitude, burst, etc.
[01:41:42.144 --> 01:41:45.347]  So, you know, it's one of those things where it's so insulting.
[01:41:45.387 --> 01:41:54.793]  You know, if you do, you know, if you have an open mind, you have an understanding of some of these things, which, you know, I'm interested in these things, and you do two hours of research with existing imagery,
[01:41:55.814 --> 01:41:56.054]  You know,
[01:42:15.655 --> 01:42:20.539]  You know, the structural integrity of an aircraft, once it's compromised, those things are made out of thin aluminum.
[01:42:20.939 --> 01:42:24.581]  They, you know, once it's compromised, those things will, you know, they'll crush so easily, right?
[01:42:24.922 --> 01:42:28.304]  But the engines are these masses, right, of titanium.
[01:42:28.324 --> 01:42:29.605]  They're heavy, heavy, heavy.
[01:42:29.985 --> 01:42:31.086]  They're not going to break up.
[01:42:31.566 --> 01:42:36.350]  You know, it's like if you see any imagery of car bombs in the Middle East, for example.
[01:42:36.750 --> 01:42:39.311]  You know, you have the entire car completely disintegrated, right?
[01:42:39.331 --> 01:42:41.491]  But there's always an engine block sitting there.
[01:42:41.571 --> 01:42:42.931]  That thing does not break up.
[01:42:42.951 --> 01:42:45.672]  You know, it's the one piece that, like, stays intact.
[01:42:46.152 --> 01:42:50.273]  So, you know, when you see, even on the debris field in Flight 93, right?
[01:42:50.293 --> 01:42:51.713]  The debris field's eight miles wide.
[01:42:51.753 --> 01:42:53.033]  There's an engine five miles away.
[01:42:53.073 --> 01:42:55.954]  The photographs of the engine are, the engine is intact.
[01:42:56.014 --> 01:42:56.534]  It's an engine.
[01:42:57.054 --> 01:43:01.195]  So when the cruise missile is what I think hit it,
[01:43:02.095 --> 01:43:07.258]  The Pentagon, on either side of that hole, there should have been massive holes, and the windows aren't even broken.
[01:43:07.438 --> 01:43:09.099]  It's the most insulting thing.
[01:43:09.179 --> 01:43:11.880]  And then later, after hours of fire, part of the roof caves in.
[01:43:11.940 --> 01:43:12.200]  Exactly.
[01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:13.881]  And they try to show that on the news.
[01:43:13.941 --> 01:43:21.385]  We have hundreds of these big, high-def photos that the government even took, and it's a smoking hole that looks like a perfect missile blast, and everybody smelled cordite.
[01:43:21.625 --> 01:43:27.848]  Then they release some blurry image six years after that doesn't even show anything and say, there's the plane.
[01:43:28.029 --> 01:43:28.309]  Exactly.
[01:43:28.329 --> 01:43:30.030]  Meanwhile, they had hundreds of high-def cameras.
[01:43:30.050 --> 01:43:30.830]  They won't release those.
[01:43:31.130 --> 01:43:39.573]  Of course, and the one image that they do release, if you lay a 757 over the size of that image, it's dwarfed.
[01:43:39.633 --> 01:43:46.535]  It has a small profile, small signature, and a 757 would dwarf that thing and make a bigger hole, and the wings, and the engines.
[01:43:46.875 --> 01:43:47.575]  It's like ludicrous.
[01:43:48.075 --> 01:43:54.657]  And the fact that it happened to hit the mainly unoccupied section of the Pentagon, right?
[01:43:54.697 --> 01:43:55.717]  It was under construction.
[01:43:56.137 --> 01:43:57.338]  Why do they think we're so dumb?
[01:43:57.978 --> 01:43:58.318]  I don't know.
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:20.920]  And, you know, it's precision.
[01:44:20.980 --> 01:44:22.141]  It's precision to hit a runway.
[01:44:22.181 --> 01:44:23.661]  It's precision to hit the end of a runway.
[01:44:24.321 --> 01:44:45.106]  And so you, uh, and so what you do is you, uh, you, you, you take these guys that supposedly, like, took some classes on how to steer an aircraft, and you're trying to sell me the idea that they were able to hit the Pentagon precisely, put it into a, put it into a controlled descent, get into ground effect, and, you know, hit it, like, what, 12 feet above the ground?
[01:44:45.166 --> 01:44:45.887]  Like, perfect.
[01:44:45.927 --> 01:44:46.887]  Like, perfect.
[01:44:47.367 --> 01:44:49.989]  Hundreds of top pilots said they couldn't do that on their best day.
[01:44:50.169 --> 01:44:50.470]  I know.
[01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:51.350]  They couldn't even do it.
[01:44:51.390 --> 01:44:58.836]  They couldn't be that precise with it because, you know, getting into ground effect where you're riding on that air cushion and riding it right into that.
[01:44:58.976 --> 01:45:07.063]  Even when they've had 50, 60 miles to get ready, you come in and only the best pilots can set them down smooth, but still they have to time it just right.
[01:45:07.223 --> 01:45:08.904]  And that's why a runway is 9,000 feet.
[01:45:09.665 --> 01:45:12.766]  And the plane comes in like this, it doesn't come in near them perfectly.
[01:45:12.986 --> 01:45:13.566]  It's ridiculous.
[01:45:13.606 --> 01:45:15.726]  So tell me about Building 7, because you know more about that.
[01:45:15.806 --> 01:45:17.006]  No, no, Dan, we've got you here.
[01:45:17.026 --> 01:45:21.647]  That's why I knew you'd be perfect for radio, because you and I were just, you know, really hit it off when we're talking.
[01:45:21.667 --> 01:45:25.868]  You said you had a lot of friends that were listeners, and I'm just honored to have you here.
[01:45:25.888 --> 01:45:34.050]  And I wanted to talk about some of the interesting stories with celebrities and politicians, and also just get your view on the world, and ask how you became such an awesome photographer.
[01:45:34.870 --> 01:45:35.851]  Started when I was a kid.
[01:45:36.092 --> 01:45:36.993]  My favorite thing to do.
[01:45:37.013 --> 01:45:43.201]  I think the thing I'm most grateful for in my life is that, you know, every day I get up and I do exactly what I love to do.
[01:45:43.959 --> 01:45:52.742]  You know, I think the majority of the people that are, you know, have an interest, have a hobby, you know, it's an after work enterprise, you know, it can't be parlayed into a career.
[01:45:53.302 --> 01:46:01.805]  Yeah, I don't know, I feel really fortunate about it, but also, on some level, I'm not really surprised by it, you know, because it was always my passion, it was always what I felt like I would do.
[01:46:01.825 --> 01:46:05.006]  If you follow your passion and do it because it's a passion, you're going to be successful.
[01:46:05.026 --> 01:46:05.006]  100%.
[01:46:05.426 --> 01:46:10.668]  Everybody else I've run into are trying to be famous, or trying to be successful, if you just have passion.
[01:46:10.808 --> 01:46:11.228]  Exactly.
[01:46:12.527 --> 01:46:15.110]  Yeah, it's the way you're expressing your passion in the universe.
[01:46:15.130 --> 01:46:21.416]  Someone told me that, said, if you have something to give the universe, the universe will beat a path to your door.
[01:46:21.856 --> 01:46:22.737]  And I really believe that.
[01:46:22.837 --> 01:46:30.844]  You know, it's like, you know, I'm a freelancer, and I've been freelance for about 25 years, and people ask me all the time, like, oh my God, how can you live like that?
[01:46:31.505 --> 01:46:33.486]  You have no idea what you're doing next month, you know?
[01:46:33.906 --> 01:46:35.467]  Don't you want some kind of steady job?
[01:46:35.687 --> 01:46:36.347]  This or that?
[01:46:36.467 --> 01:46:39.228]  And, you know, about 20 years ago, I made peace with it.
[01:46:39.429 --> 01:46:40.569]  I believe in the process.
[01:46:40.669 --> 01:46:53.115]  I put myself out there and I feel like every time I do a job, I'm really respectful and reverent of the fact that the client's trusting me, they're investing their money in me, and I knock it out of the park every time.
[01:46:53.135 --> 01:46:53.435]  You do.
[01:46:53.495 --> 01:46:54.155]  Dan Winters.

[01:49:45.633 --> 01:49:47.054]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:49:47.634 --> 01:49:48.154]  It's here.

[01:50:48.934 --> 01:50:51.055]  Owned by me, Big John Lipston.
[01:50:57.737 --> 01:51:03.298]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:51:04.727 --> 01:51:07.369]  Well, one of the top photographers in the world.
[01:51:07.389 --> 01:51:09.271]  I mean, I've looked him up.
[01:51:09.291 --> 01:51:11.172]  Some say the top photographer in the world.
[01:51:11.252 --> 01:51:13.174]  I mean, there's no one more prolific.
[01:51:13.754 --> 01:51:14.495]  And we're honored to have him.
[01:51:14.515 --> 01:51:18.458]  We're going to be scrolling through some of the politicians, movie stars, you name it.
[01:51:19.599 --> 01:51:23.742]  Religious leaders that he has photographed for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:51:23.783 --> 01:51:27.345]  Or you can go to danwintersphoto.com to see a lot more.
[01:51:27.706 --> 01:51:31.429]  Because he has computers in his office and I'd be seeing photos of Schwarzenegger and photos of
[01:51:32.330 --> 01:51:32.930]  Al Gore.
[01:51:33.451 --> 01:51:37.755]  They're all so unique and just almost like a lens.
[01:51:37.815 --> 01:51:40.377]  Take the spirit of somebody and then magnify it.
[01:51:40.397 --> 01:51:41.979]  I think that's what Dan Winters does.
[01:51:42.259 --> 01:51:44.761]  And we're going to talk about how you're able to do that.
[01:51:46.769 --> 01:51:47.889]  Kind of an idiot savant.
[01:51:48.530 --> 01:51:51.050]  I'm not saying you're an idiot, but you know what I mean.
[01:51:51.130 --> 01:51:52.811]  I think of myself with political stuff sometimes.
[01:51:53.371 --> 01:51:54.811]  You just know you have that talent.
[01:51:55.172 --> 01:51:58.713]  But going back to the term conspiracy theorist, you're right.
[01:51:58.733 --> 01:52:03.974]  It's just a label they throw on people to say, oh, this information can't be looked at.
[01:52:04.334 --> 01:52:09.676]  It's a way to downgrade it, when really just questioning the system
[01:52:10.356 --> 01:52:11.957]  Is what any free human is supposed to do.
[01:52:11.977 --> 01:52:13.437]  I mean, here's the Globe and Mail today.
[01:52:13.897 --> 01:52:16.598]  The dangerously unbalanced world of global governance.
[01:52:16.998 --> 01:52:18.939]  They're admitting world governments being established.
[01:52:18.959 --> 01:52:19.859]  It's run by the banks.
[01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:23.601]  But then they say you're a conspiracy theorist if you don't want to be a slave of banks.
[01:52:24.381 --> 01:52:24.761]  Exactly.
[01:52:25.101 --> 01:52:32.684]  And I'm sure you've probably used the quote on your show, probably on more than one occasion, but there's that great quote by Goering.
[01:52:33.304 --> 01:52:41.048]  From the Nuremberg trials that says, you know, the normal people don't want war, but after all, it's not the normal people that are making the policy.
[01:52:41.228 --> 01:52:46.350]  You know, it's the politicians that are making the policy, and it's very easy to bring the normal people along.
[01:52:46.430 --> 01:52:52.913]  All you have to do is convince them that they're being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism.
[01:52:53.233 --> 01:52:54.214]  It works every time.
[01:52:54.654 --> 01:52:55.794]  And that is so true.
[01:52:55.854 --> 01:52:59.296]  You know, the whole idea of questioning anything, I mean, even the fact that
[01:52:59.696 --> 01:53:07.082]  You know how contrived the term Patriot Act was you know so it implies that if you like if you resisted at all that oh man you're not patriotic.
[01:53:07.262 --> 01:53:12.706]  Or the new freedom initiative to put half of America's kids on psychotropic drugs that's a new freedom.
[01:53:12.746 --> 01:53:21.313]  Yeah absolutely absolutely what about the I mean talk locally you know what about the the police chief in Austin with the mandatory you know if you refuse breathalyzer
[01:53:21.793 --> 01:53:23.134]  The mandatory blood test.
[01:53:23.154 --> 01:53:24.315]  Without even having warrants.
[01:53:24.375 --> 01:53:29.519]  Where they take you to a hospital and they violate your physical body to get blood out of you.
[01:53:29.539 --> 01:53:30.840]  And now they're training the cops to do it.
[01:53:30.921 --> 01:53:34.764]  It's unbelievable to me that anybody would stand for that for one second.
[01:53:34.784 --> 01:53:46.253]  I mean clearly, historically, there's been policies that have been administered that have, you know, it's taken a while to get rid of them because you have to go through the appellate courts and to the Supreme Court and then suddenly it's deemed like unconstitutional.
[01:53:46.513 --> 01:53:47.354]  But in the meantime,
[01:53:47.714 --> 01:53:56.517]  You know, people are being, and believe me, you know, I think drunk driving is aberrant and I would not participate in it at all, but the idea that you can actually, like, take blood out of someone's body?
[01:53:56.577 --> 01:54:04.139]  Well, they undermine the Bill of Rights and Constitution for a supposed greater good, but we know they're scientifically really just targeting the general population.
[01:54:04.159 --> 01:54:09.581]  It's like Homeland Security, we've got their internal documents, it's really all pointed at the American people from the beginning.
[01:54:09.661 --> 01:54:10.141]  Absolutely.
[01:54:10.581 --> 01:54:32.399]  I did a really interesting piece, and I wish I had actually given you the photograph, but I was hired by a magazine to, actually Esquire, and they were doing a piece on FAA and the TSA people and the way they screen, and the guy that was the head of the program
[01:54:32.819 --> 01:54:33.019]  We're
[01:54:55.274 --> 01:55:03.059]  So the whole idea of the TSA screening and stuff, while I agree there should be some kind of checks and balances for people getting on an airplane, it's such a band-aid.
[01:55:03.079 --> 01:55:17.567]  When we go on jobs, we carry on $25,000 worth of cameras, and we carry them on, and it's a big case full of electronic equipment that no one in the TSA has any idea what they're looking at.
[01:55:18.007 --> 01:55:18.067]  And
[01:55:32.145 --> 01:55:35.687]  Privacy violated.
[01:55:36.247 --> 01:55:37.708]  Get back to that Esquire story.
[01:55:38.468 --> 01:55:52.035]  The guy that's being focused on is the head of this rogue entity within the TSA slash FAA whose job is to violate or breach airport security.
[01:55:52.495 --> 01:55:55.516]  What they do is they look for patterns and he came up with this whole method at Kennedy.
[01:55:57.117 --> 01:56:07.879]  Three flights to the Middle East at like four o'clock in the afternoon out of Kennedy and he said we've Watched very closely the way TSA goes through stuff and they basically don't even look at anything this stuff's going on So he said that would be a prime target.
[01:56:08.219 --> 01:56:20.761]  So they make a bomb looking device They put it in a bag and it gets through so he was doing this So my assignment from the magazine was okay Why don't you what we need you to do is we need you to figure out how to take down an aircraft So I said, okay.
[01:56:20.781 --> 01:56:24.402]  So once again, I go online I spend maybe six seven hours researching it and
[01:56:24.762 --> 01:56:27.423]  I figure out what kind of explosive to make, how you can make it.
[01:56:27.743 --> 01:56:33.925]  It's not detectable by any of the carbon-based testing methods that the TSA uses.
[01:56:33.945 --> 01:56:34.865]  Dan Winters, gotta break.
[01:56:34.885 --> 01:56:36.646]  That was a short segment, long segment coming up.
[01:56:36.666 --> 01:56:37.906]  Let's finish that story when we get back.
[01:56:38.166 --> 01:56:42.567]  Then we'll get into some of the more interesting things you've seen in your life traveling the world.
[01:56:42.908 --> 01:56:44.088]  Dan Winters is our guest.
[01:56:44.108 --> 01:56:45.788]  danwintersphoto.com.
[01:56:45.848 --> 01:56:46.529]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:56:47.549 --> 01:56:48.449]  We're on the march.
[01:56:48.929 --> 01:56:50.450]  The empire's on the run.
[01:56:51.465 --> 01:56:54.133]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:56:57.537 --> 01:57:00.139]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:57:00.559 --> 01:57:05.523]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:57:05.884 --> 01:57:07.605]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:57:07.925 --> 01:57:12.749]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:57:12.929 --> 01:57:13.890]  How much do you want?
[01:57:14.110 --> 01:57:14.850]  When do you want it?
[01:57:15.231 --> 01:57:16.832]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:57:17.112 --> 01:57:17.953]  When will you need it?
[01:57:18.193 --> 01:57:20.255]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:57:20.395 --> 01:57:21.496]  Will there be any food?
[01:57:21.736 --> 01:57:23.057]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:57:23.257 --> 01:57:28.322]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:57:28.522 --> 01:57:31.705]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:57:32.105 --> 01:57:35.609]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:57:35.929 --> 01:57:36.910]  How much will you need?
[01:57:37.150 --> 01:57:37.771]  We don't know.
[01:57:38.051 --> 01:57:38.972]  How much do you want?
[01:57:39.152 --> 01:57:39.853]  All you can get.
[01:57:40.333 --> 01:57:43.937]  Alex Jones, I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:57:44.217 --> 01:57:45.979]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:57:45.999 --> 01:57:46.920]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:57:57.082 --> 01:57:59.383]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:57:59.463 --> 01:58:01.664]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:58:01.764 --> 01:58:04.505]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:58:04.985 --> 01:58:09.726]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:58:10.087 --> 01:58:14.288]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:58:14.588 --> 01:58:16.950]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:58:17.050 --> 01:58:19.491]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:58:19.831 --> 01:58:22.393]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:58:22.733 --> 01:58:30.338]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:58:30.678 --> 01:58:35.961]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:58:36.021 --> 01:58:38.342]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:58:38.382 --> 01:58:42.344]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:58:42.604 --> 01:58:43.504]  And I got news for you.
[01:58:43.684 --> 01:58:44.665]  You're everyone else.
[01:58:45.025 --> 01:58:46.006]  Invisible Empire.

[01:59:16.510 --> 01:59:18.592]  And if you're in debt already, does it make sense?

[02:00:06.598 --> 02:00:12.764]  Folks, shifting gears into another subject briefly, and then we'll continue the story that Dan Winters was telling about this shoot for Esquire.
[02:00:12.784 --> 02:00:15.827]  We're going to get into some other important issues with him while we're scrolling.
[02:00:15.868 --> 02:00:17.850]  Great photos he's taken in the background.
[02:00:19.071 --> 02:00:22.835]  For radio listeners, you'll be able to see this archived at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:00:23.836 --> 02:00:25.537]  Charlie Sheen quits Two and a Half Men.
[02:00:26.567 --> 02:00:32.893]  I don't normally get into entertainment news, but this is not really stemming from the problems he's had.
[02:00:32.913 --> 02:00:36.277]  A good friend of mine, 9-11 truther, really smart guy, great guy.
[02:00:36.297 --> 02:00:38.459]  I can just tell you all the stuff you've heard in the news.
[02:00:38.519 --> 02:00:40.160]  It's made up or exaggerated.
[02:00:40.181 --> 02:00:48.449]  His enemies will declare victory, but a year ago he told me he wanted this to be his last season.
[02:00:51.087 --> 02:00:58.148]  Just a few months ago he told me, before the thing happened on Christmas Day, that he probably wasn't going to re-up his TV show.
[02:00:58.168 --> 02:00:59.149]  But here's the New York Post.
[02:00:59.169 --> 02:01:00.589]  See, that's not even true.
[02:01:00.629 --> 02:01:00.909]  I know Charlie.
[02:01:00.929 --> 02:01:04.630]  He wasn't drinking, wasn't using drugs, drinks way too much coffee, and smokes Marlboro Reds.
[02:01:04.690 --> 02:01:06.690]  So I spent a lot of time with him.
[02:01:21.073 --> 02:01:28.218]  He went to a basically a spa so that under the stress he wouldn't go back on alcohol or drugs he'd been off of for years.
[02:01:28.499 --> 02:01:30.760]  So that's a lie here from his enemy the New York Post.
[02:01:31.721 --> 02:01:37.445]  But his spokesman Stan Rosenthal did not deny the report.
[02:01:37.925 --> 02:01:41.308]  Charlie's deal is only through this current season he told people.
[02:01:41.668 --> 02:01:43.550]  So there's the inside scoop here folks.
[02:01:43.930 --> 02:01:49.254]  Charlie quit because he wants to spend time with his family and is sick of eight plus seasons and
[02:01:50.512 --> 02:01:57.019]  The New York Post and others are spinning this like it's a problem with his wife, Brooke, who's a nice person, like that's why he's quitting.
[02:01:57.219 --> 02:01:59.742]  That may have been the cherry on top, but there's that info.
[02:01:59.942 --> 02:02:03.225]  Dan, I apologize for digressing off into fluff, but Charlie's my friend.
[02:02:03.245 --> 02:02:05.367]  I wanted to back him up and set the record straight.
[02:02:05.388 --> 02:02:06.308]  Yeah, I don't think it's fluff.
[02:02:06.328 --> 02:02:07.530]  He's done some good work, I think.
[02:02:08.050 --> 02:02:22.051]  Well, you know, everybody's human, and people love to see somebody big in trouble, and even when Limbaugh got caught in stuff worse than what Sheen's involved in, I wasn't sharing his downfall, even though I disagree with him passionately, because I just don't...
[02:02:23.092 --> 02:02:25.174]  I only cheer for real tyrants going down.
[02:02:25.214 --> 02:02:27.155]  You know, people like Hitler or Stalin or Mao.
[02:02:27.656 --> 02:02:28.316]  I agree, totally.
[02:02:28.696 --> 02:02:30.478]  And I think you're absolutely right about that.
[02:02:30.578 --> 02:02:35.201]  I think we love watching people ascend the ladder, but we like watching the ladder fall over much better.
[02:02:35.722 --> 02:02:49.012]  And it's, you know, what I think it is, is I think that, you know, the media and the way the media works and the way publishing works, etc., and I'm a part of it, so I mean, I'd be one, you know, I should be pointing the finger back at myself, but the idea is to create a lure.
[02:02:49.172 --> 02:02:49.692]  I think so.
[02:03:07.357 --> 02:03:07.998]  I can go see
[02:03:25.899 --> 02:03:30.900]  And I think it's sick wanting to see somebody fall when this happens to our own families and neighbors.
[02:03:30.940 --> 02:03:31.520]  This is sick.
[02:03:31.560 --> 02:03:32.661]  This shows a sickness.
[02:03:33.041 --> 02:03:37.262]  And I see it getting progressively worse that people love to see somebody in trouble.
[02:03:37.322 --> 02:03:38.722]  But I interrupted you.
[02:03:38.762 --> 02:03:39.062]  Go ahead.
[02:03:39.262 --> 02:03:51.185]  Well, I think to get to what you're saying right now, too, I think that, you know, I think that when someone gets really angry at someone who's suffering rather than look at it from love and detachment and with compassion,
[02:03:51.656 --> 02:03:56.200]  I think it says something about the individual, you know, that's throwing the stones.
[02:03:56.600 --> 02:04:00.003]  You know, he who is without sin, may he cast the first stone.
[02:04:00.063 --> 02:04:03.206]  I mean, to do a biblical quote, it's absolutely spot on.
[02:04:03.246 --> 02:04:07.570]  You know, we are all fallible, we're all failed, we all have our own problems.
[02:04:08.030 --> 02:04:13.313]  I realize several years ago that, you know, the one thing that we all have in common is that we all have problems.
[02:04:13.553 --> 02:04:13.893]  Period.
[02:04:13.913 --> 02:04:14.693]  We all have problems.
[02:04:14.793 --> 02:04:18.035]  And I think our role in life is to try to work through those problems.
[02:04:18.215 --> 02:04:19.315]  And that's the human condition.
[02:04:19.455 --> 02:04:19.916]  Absolutely.
[02:04:19.936 --> 02:04:19.916]  100%.
[02:04:19.956 --> 02:04:20.856]  So yeah, it is.
[02:04:20.896 --> 02:04:27.039]  Yeah, I only want to bring down people that are hurting masses of innocents and who are consciously
[02:04:27.759 --> 02:04:33.722]  Setting people up, consciously hurting others, consciously launching wars, torturing people, betraying.
[02:04:34.483 --> 02:04:35.883]  That's why I hate these politicians.
[02:04:36.544 --> 02:04:47.049]  Bush, of course, and Obama, expanding wars, wiretapping, continuing the torture, continuing the arrest, and watching him use all of this hope that people had put into him against them.
[02:04:47.529 --> 02:04:49.450]  And again, I don't personally hate Obama.
[02:04:49.530 --> 02:04:51.691]  I know he's a puppet who they plan to destroy.
[02:04:52.232 --> 02:04:56.614]  It's just that I realize that the institution itself is just
[02:04:57.174 --> 02:04:58.856]  Yeah, the institution.
[02:04:58.896 --> 02:04:59.996]  And I think that's a good point.
[02:05:00.697 --> 02:05:01.398]  I worked with him.
[02:05:02.619 --> 02:05:05.040]  He seemed like one of those guys you'd want to go out and have a beer with.
[02:05:05.081 --> 02:05:06.342]  He seemed like a totally cool guy.
[02:05:06.762 --> 02:05:13.627]  I believe, truthfully, that when he was campaigning, he has a lot of ethos that he adheres to, that he really believes in.
[02:05:13.647 --> 02:05:17.250]  But I think when you get in that office and the first day that you're briefed,
[02:05:18.591 --> 02:05:20.172]  You know, it's all bets are off, you know.
[02:05:20.192 --> 02:05:23.274]  I mean, the first day it was like, we're closing Guantanamo.
[02:05:23.635 --> 02:05:26.757]  And I saw a photograph recently that was the most ironic photograph.
[02:05:26.837 --> 02:05:36.002]  It was a picture of one of the guards or one of the officials at Guantanamo hanging his photo up in the lobby when you come in.
[02:05:37.014 --> 02:05:44.478]  You know, it's the most ironic image, considering, you know, if you've ever been to a military installation, when you walk in the main building, there's the chain of command.
[02:05:44.838 --> 02:05:51.662]  So, you know, you'd walk in a building during Bush's administration, and Bush was in the middle, and then on either side, there were photographs of the chain of command that goes down.
[02:05:52.102 --> 02:05:57.185]  So, at Guantanamo, there's the chain of command, and there's Obama, the photograph of Obama right in the middle.
[02:05:57.765 --> 02:06:01.306]  And you know, once again, I truly believe.
[02:06:01.386 --> 02:06:04.227]  I won't weep when Kissinger drops.
[02:06:04.247 --> 02:06:06.148]  I won't weep when Rockefeller drops.
[02:06:06.168 --> 02:06:09.149]  I don't think honestly anybody will.
[02:06:09.189 --> 02:06:11.910]  And that's really unfortunate that they've lived a life like that.
[02:06:11.990 --> 02:06:18.332]  But you know, once again, I try to view these things... Yeah, their human journey is just a tragic event of power and avarice.
[02:06:18.633 --> 02:06:19.873]  Now I interrupted you with a break.
[02:06:19.913 --> 02:06:23.514]  Let's go back to that Esquire piece that you were talking about.
[02:06:24.215 --> 02:06:25.455]  Recap it and then tell us about it.
[02:06:25.675 --> 02:06:38.442]  Okay, the assignment, to get back to it, Esquire was doing a piece on airport security and the idea of, you know, how difficult my assignment was, Dan, research and illustrate how difficult it would be to take down an airliner.
[02:06:39.043 --> 02:06:42.305]  And initially I thought, well, that's kind of an irresponsible job.
[02:06:42.365 --> 02:06:44.426]  It's kind of irresponsible to illustrate that.
[02:06:44.486 --> 02:06:46.467]  But then I thought about it and I thought, well, it's actually...
[02:06:46.867 --> 02:06:47.528]  We're good to go!
[02:07:07.488 --> 02:07:07.909]  Thank you.
[02:07:24.315 --> 02:07:29.160]  You get three guys working together, and this is all based on the fact that these guys are going to off themselves.
[02:07:29.220 --> 02:07:34.765]  But there doesn't seem to be a shortage of guys that are willing to... And you're doing this drill to try to stop this from happening?
[02:07:35.046 --> 02:07:38.189]  Or to try to illustrate to people, like, hey, look how easy this is.
[02:07:38.209 --> 02:07:40.251]  Look how easy it would be to do this.
[02:07:40.631 --> 02:07:41.893]  It's almost like a wake-up call.
[02:07:41.913 --> 02:07:42.753]  It's like, oh my God.
[02:07:42.773 --> 02:07:43.694]  We think these guys are...
[02:07:45.596 --> 02:07:48.078]  Or, you know, the security is such a band-aid.
[02:07:48.118 --> 02:07:50.420]  You know, right after 9-11, what was it like?
[02:07:50.460 --> 02:07:54.163]  You couldn't walk two feet away from your bag without getting, like, scolded, right?
[02:07:54.564 --> 02:07:58.367]  Now, it's like, I'll leave my bag at the gate, ask someone to watch it, go to the bathroom, come back.
[02:07:58.427 --> 02:07:59.287]  It's like, no one's worried.
[02:07:59.307 --> 02:08:01.209]  There was National Guard in the airport when it happened.
[02:08:01.229 --> 02:08:03.471]  But we go back to the point that most of it's manufactured.
[02:08:03.491 --> 02:08:05.272]  Have you had time to see the underwear bombing?
[02:08:05.332 --> 02:08:05.993]  I totally agree.
[02:08:06.393 --> 02:08:09.596]  You know, it's... I mean, the State Department says they were ordered by a U.S.
[02:08:09.636 --> 02:08:11.778]  intelligence agency to help him get on the plane.
[02:08:12.398 --> 02:08:13.098]  Okay, so there you go.
[02:08:13.479 --> 02:08:14.319]  So it's the same thing.
[02:08:14.439 --> 02:08:16.520]  It's the whole idea of, like, you keep them in fear.
[02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:19.401]  You know, threat level orange, threat level yellow, threat level red.
[02:08:19.822 --> 02:08:23.423]  I laugh when I hear that stuff when I'm at the airport, because it reminds me of that Gurin quote.
[02:08:23.543 --> 02:08:25.144]  It's like, you know, keep them in fear.
[02:08:25.264 --> 02:08:26.645]  Keep them feeling like they're being repressed.
[02:08:26.945 --> 02:08:28.065]  Let me get back to the F-square thing.
[02:08:28.105 --> 02:08:31.387]  So I figure out the whole process to do this.
[02:08:31.407 --> 02:08:32.407]  You know, you get three guys.
[02:08:32.468 --> 02:08:35.269]  You have two guys carrying the explosive device in their groin.
[02:08:35.869 --> 02:08:44.254]  Once again, usually, and this might be changing, but usually, even with a pat-down, they don't go right to that area, you know, so you can get that in.
[02:08:44.795 --> 02:08:50.959]  And then you take in a 9-volt battery, some wire, a couple flashlight bulbs.
[02:08:52.179 --> 02:08:58.823]  I used a timer, was a timer off of a dog feeder, right, that I bought at, you know, Academy or something.
[02:08:59.064 --> 02:09:04.407]  And so I took all, the idea is you take all this stuff in independently, which is, it'd all be very easy to get in.
[02:09:04.867 --> 02:09:07.388]  The only thing I thought would be difficult was maybe some duct tape.
[02:09:07.448 --> 02:09:14.109]  So I thought, well, what you'd do is you'd line your entire bag with duct tape, and then you could get it in, and then you could pull the strips off and use it.
[02:09:14.149 --> 02:09:18.950]  But then you go into the little kiosk, you buy a couple bottles of Coke, and you all go to the men's room.
[02:09:19.090 --> 02:09:20.771]  One guy goes into the handicapped stall.
[02:09:21.271 --> 02:09:26.732]  He spends about 15 minutes assembling the thing, getting it all ready to go, puts it on his bag, takes it into the plane.
[02:09:26.992 --> 02:09:31.233]  And then the research further was, well, okay, so he blows it up in the plane, it might compromise
[02:09:31.693 --> 02:09:34.595]  You know, the hull, it might do this, it might do that, but it probably wouldn't take it down.
[02:09:34.615 --> 02:09:42.580]  So what you do then, which is also another one of these ridiculous band-aids, is that, you know, once 9-11 happened, they reinforced all the cockpit doors.
[02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:44.041]  You know, they made these Kevlar doors.
[02:09:44.441 --> 02:09:45.122]  You can't get in.
[02:09:45.182 --> 02:09:49.665]  But what they didn't do is they didn't reinforce the bulkhead behind the captain or the co-pilot.
[02:09:49.925 --> 02:09:51.066]  All they did is do a door.
[02:09:51.666 --> 02:09:55.729]  So 757 and a couple other aircrafts have a, in the first class cabin, they have a,
[02:09:56.209 --> 02:09:57.730]  How long ago did you do that for Esquire?
[02:10:19.349 --> 02:10:20.210]  What should we google?
[02:10:20.490 --> 02:10:22.632]  Dan Winter's Esquire, how to bomb a plane?
[02:10:32.318 --> 02:10:33.318]  We're good to go.
[02:10:55.322 --> 02:11:04.729]  I mean, you were telling me stories, and I don't know if some of them are off-record or if you want to tell stories, but what are some interesting stories about movie stars or politicians or Rick Perry or whatever that you can tell?
[02:11:04.749 --> 02:11:06.910]  Okay, Rick Perry, the hair politician.
[02:11:06.950 --> 02:11:09.432]  The funniest story about Rick Perry, I photographed him twice.
[02:11:10.493 --> 02:11:14.295]  You know, he is the consummate, the consummate smooth guy.
[02:11:14.415 --> 02:11:20.520]  He comes in, you almost instantly have a nickname, he remembers your name, it's this whole politician thing.
[02:11:20.540 --> 02:11:22.081]  You know, and I've been other politicians, you know.
[02:11:22.761 --> 02:11:30.425]  A good friend of mine, Jack Valenti, who just passed recently, he told me, if you don't like Bush, don't spend 10 minutes in a room with him, because you'll love him.
[02:11:30.565 --> 02:11:33.306]  Because he's that kind of, you know, you instantly get a nickname.
[02:11:33.327 --> 02:11:36.548]  You instantly feel like he has that ability to make you feel special, you know.
[02:11:37.148 --> 02:11:39.970]  And, you know, I was offered twice to photograph him.
[02:11:40.030 --> 02:11:47.994]  Newsweek offered me a cover the day after the election, the initial election, when he was first voted president.
[02:11:48.434 --> 02:11:53.956]  And I turned it down because I just fundamentally, like, I fundamentally can't, like, photograph someone.
[02:11:53.976 --> 02:11:58.938]  Well, you know, he looks more like a demon when he does the smiles, or like an evil clown.
[02:12:00.599 --> 02:12:04.120]  When he does that laughing, I mean, it upsets me.
[02:12:04.440 --> 02:12:07.301]  And, you know, he had me arrested one time for just asking him a question.
[02:12:07.321 --> 02:12:11.603]  I don't know if you ever Googled, Alex Jones arrested for asking Governor a question at a press conference.
[02:12:11.883 --> 02:12:14.704]  I asked him about the world government, and they just drug me out and arrested me.
[02:12:14.724 --> 02:12:15.164]  Is that right?
[02:12:15.465 --> 02:12:20.767]  Well, I had a funny run-in with Rick Perry at a bicycle sports shop.
[02:12:20.827 --> 02:12:28.530]  I went in there to get something, and he was in there, and he was in his bike outfit, and he had his assistants with the big file of faxes and a couple of the Capitol Police with him.
[02:12:29.131 --> 02:12:36.394]  And so I heard him, I was in there, and I was kind of listening, and I heard him talking to his assistant, and he said, like, okay, I'm going to go for a bike ride from 10 to
[02:12:37.034 --> 02:12:42.596]  Twelve, then I'm going to meet Bill for lunch, then after that I'm going to do this and go for a run, then I'm going to go sweat, you know, this.
[02:12:42.916 --> 02:12:49.597]  And I'm listening to all this, and as soon as he finished it, I was standing right next to him and I said, uh, you planning on doing any governing today?
[02:12:49.617 --> 02:12:53.078]  Because it sounded like his day was full of recreation, you know?
[02:12:53.498 --> 02:13:02.041]  But, uh, yeah, these guys, you know, most of these guys, and I think the point you brought up about Bush's laugh, my experience with politicians is they don't really know
[02:13:03.181 --> 02:13:30.519]  What they're supposed to do and so they have this kind of fake smile that they throw on and it's you know I photographed Phil Graham one time and I and I and I said I said he kept doing this really bizarre smile and I was trying to get a shot that felt natural like we were talking about earlier you were talking about the idea of how to kind of like capture the essence of someone you know and when they're not taking direction and they're they're they're doing what they think a photograph is supposed to be you know I think a lot of people think like oh great photos of a sunset or something you know it's like
[02:13:30.999 --> 02:13:44.639]  Super passé, but once again a sunset inspires all of us people look at a photo of the sunset and it takes them to that point whatever the most common sort of genre of photographs, but Phil Graham said I said yeah, maybe just relax your mouth Maybe just do something serious, and he said boy.
[02:13:44.799 --> 02:13:46.482]  I worked on this smile for a long time.
[02:13:46.502 --> 02:13:47.243]  I'm gonna smile
[02:13:47.839 --> 02:13:54.543]  So it was the most painfully forced smile you could possibly imagine, but I don't even know where we're at.
[02:14:05.510 --> 02:14:09.574]  I just like photographs, you know, that are of an old barn or old woman.
[02:14:10.534 --> 02:14:11.755]  I love all of your photos.
[02:14:11.856 --> 02:14:12.396]  Great, thanks.
[02:14:13.577 --> 02:14:14.278]  Because it does.
[02:14:14.698 --> 02:14:18.601]  So I was accurate when I said that you somehow draw out the essence of people.
[02:14:18.621 --> 02:14:24.947]  I try to, and you know, I think to a certain extent it's like a, I've called it before, I've called it a manufactured intimacy.
[02:14:25.487 --> 02:14:44.063]  And I think the idea behind, you know, the range of human expression and human emotion is so wide that I think what I try to do is I try to capture sort of like usually, except for the case with your crazy screaming photograph, is that, but that's a part of your personality and so that was an accurate representation, I suppose, right?
[02:14:44.443 --> 02:14:51.548]  But the idea is to just try to go to a place that feels pensive, that feels introspective, that feels, you know, quiet.
[02:14:51.608 --> 02:14:54.210]  Oftentimes it doesn't feel like it's, you know, manufactured.
[02:14:54.230 --> 02:14:58.513]  It doesn't feel like it's in genuine, you know, it's it's capturing a moment of that individual.
[02:14:58.553 --> 02:14:59.894]  But I think it's a reflective moment.
[02:15:00.195 --> 02:15:02.156]  And I think people respond to reflective moments.
[02:15:02.296 --> 02:15:05.798]  Why did you choose this photo as the cover page when you opened the magazine up?
[02:15:05.818 --> 02:15:06.078]  I didn't.
[02:15:06.239 --> 02:15:07.039]  The magazine didn't.
[02:15:07.099 --> 02:15:23.369]  I would have hoped, what I was hoping is that the screaming photo was by itself with the, my dream would have been the screaming photo was by itself and the typography on one side and then you turned to that photo and then the last photo was the one in the set.
[02:15:23.550 --> 02:15:24.690]  You know, I had hoped for that.
[02:15:25.031 --> 02:15:25.991]  But I was really happy with it.
[02:15:26.011 --> 02:15:28.753]  So first show me in the screaming and then show the calm.
[02:15:29.013 --> 02:15:29.613]  Yeah, I like that.
[02:15:29.713 --> 02:15:34.174]  Yeah, just kind of jump back and forth, because once again, and I really like this very flattering photo of you.
[02:15:34.194 --> 02:15:34.734]  Yeah, it is.
[02:15:34.874 --> 02:15:36.815]  You like that one, huh?
[02:15:36.975 --> 02:15:38.295]  It's your new head shot, exactly.
[02:15:38.315 --> 02:15:42.976]  Well, that's what I look like to myself when I'm looking in the mirror, you know, brushing my teeth, and then I'm not really photogenic.
[02:15:43.496 --> 02:15:49.497]  I mean, I'm not very narcissistic, but at the same time, you're looking at photos of yourself, it's like, that doesn't really look like me.
[02:15:49.537 --> 02:15:50.797]  Of course, absolutely.
[02:15:51.237 --> 02:15:53.718]  But your photos, because I've met some of these famous people in person,
[02:15:55.014 --> 02:15:57.297]  The photos you take of people is what they really look like.
[02:15:57.337 --> 02:15:58.298]  Yeah.
[02:15:58.338 --> 02:16:04.126]  That's a challenge when you're shooting someone famous, by the way, because you've seen them represented in the media so many times.
[02:16:04.566 --> 02:16:08.611]  It's like, how do you make that quintessential image and still have it be a recognizable image?
[02:16:08.651 --> 02:16:10.474]  And what I try to do in my photographs, and I think
[02:16:10.874 --> 02:16:15.177]  To a large extent, I'm successful, is to try to create a timeless, iconic image.
[02:16:15.277 --> 02:16:18.619]  So that is not to use like fancy, tricky lighting stuff.
[02:16:18.980 --> 02:16:20.841]  To keep it really simple, there he is.
[02:16:20.861 --> 02:16:23.082]  Let's quit looking at me now.
[02:16:23.763 --> 02:16:24.864]  In fact, we don't have much time.
[02:16:24.964 --> 02:16:27.866]  Run through some of the other photos at the end of that that we haven't seen of other people.
[02:16:27.906 --> 02:16:28.186]  Go ahead.
[02:16:28.206 --> 02:16:30.007]  Did we find the Lee Harvey Oswald photo yet?
[02:16:30.027 --> 02:16:31.528]  We're going to show that when we come back.
[02:16:31.568 --> 02:16:32.248]  Sorry Dan, go ahead.
[02:16:32.369 --> 02:16:32.969]  Alright, no problem.
[02:16:33.209 --> 02:16:35.172]  I'm in here directing while I'm on TV!
[02:16:35.232 --> 02:16:36.413]  Where are we at?
[02:16:36.593 --> 02:16:39.277]  Here, just continue the direction of the flow of the conversation.
[02:16:39.317 --> 02:16:49.049]  No, it's just you were saying, you were talking about how to... Oh, to create a genuine moment and still have it be an accurate representation of what that individual looks like.
[02:16:49.529 --> 02:16:58.716]  Because, once again, you know, people that are really widely known in the news and stuff, it's very difficult to create an image that stands out and that's going to connect to you because you've seen so many of them.
[02:16:58.836 --> 02:17:03.899]  So the idea of trying to create, you know, try to heighten it to the point where it becomes iconic, I guess, ultimately.
[02:17:03.939 --> 02:17:09.603]  And, you know, through the history of photography, there are those single images that represent to everyone.
[02:17:09.623 --> 02:17:16.088]  You know, if I said Lincoln, there are a couple photographs, even though he was photographed, you know, he wasn't actually photographed that many times, like 12 times, I think.
[02:17:16.568 --> 02:17:17.428]  But there are a couple.
[02:17:17.468 --> 02:17:24.170]  You know, there's that one at the end of the war, shortly before he was killed, where you just see how completely decimated he had become from the war.
[02:17:24.190 --> 02:17:25.270]  He looks like a corpse already.
[02:17:25.390 --> 02:17:25.970]  Unbelievable.
[02:17:26.090 --> 02:17:29.931]  Yeah, just... There's the Iwo Jima Marines, how exhausted they look at the triumph.
[02:17:30.171 --> 02:17:30.611]  Absolutely.
[02:17:30.791 --> 02:17:33.552]  There's the sailor kissing the beautiful woman in New York.
[02:17:33.652 --> 02:17:34.432]  Alfred Eisenstadt.
[02:17:34.452 --> 02:17:37.573]  And you could just capture that they're going to be having a great time together that night.
[02:17:37.653 --> 02:17:44.274]  Jill Rosenthal with the flag-raising shot and Alfred Eisenstadt with the Times Square shot.
[02:17:44.394 --> 02:17:44.914]  We've got a break.
[02:17:44.934 --> 02:17:54.377]  When we come back, your favorite photograph in the world, or your top three or four, and then we'll look at this fake Lee Harvey Oswald photo with a photographic expert, and a lot more.
[02:17:54.417 --> 02:17:55.257]  He's Dan Winters.

[02:19:01.781 --> 02:19:02.682]  Tyranny is here.
[02:19:03.022 --> 02:19:06.765]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:19:06.885 --> 02:19:09.167]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:19:09.187 --> 02:19:14.671]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:19:15.071 --> 02:19:21.376]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:19:21.736 --> 02:19:27.301]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:19:27.721 --> 02:19:31.484]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our Republic has fallen.

[02:19:42.113 --> 02:19:45.255]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:19:45.675 --> 02:19:47.097]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:19:47.657 --> 02:19:48.178]  It's here.

[02:19:59.226 --> 02:20:00.367]  This is not a drill.
[02:20:00.467 --> 02:20:02.428]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[02:20:02.969 --> 02:20:04.570]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[02:20:04.870 --> 02:20:11.995]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[02:20:12.095 --> 02:20:16.458]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[02:20:16.478 --> 02:20:26.806]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[02:20:27.466 --> 02:20:28.026]  We're good to go.
[02:21:09.986 --> 02:21:18.352]  Well, there's the famous set-up photo of Photoshop from back in 1963 before they had Photoshopped Lee Harvey Oswald as a photographer.
[02:21:19.113 --> 02:21:20.594]  What is wrong with that photograph?
[02:21:21.174 --> 02:21:23.856]  Well, you know, there are a lot of things wrong with it.
[02:21:23.936 --> 02:21:25.618]  The most obvious thing for me is
[02:21:26.238 --> 02:21:38.663]  That the light is coming from his left from an angle and at a pretty low angle in the sky because you can see the shadow coming back from his body at about 10 o'clock.
[02:21:39.024 --> 02:21:48.548]  So that would indicate a light source that's off his axis at about 5 o'clock and so that's inconsistent then with the lighting that's on his face.
[02:21:48.968 --> 02:21:51.429]  The lighting that's on his face, if you'll notice the shadow,
[02:21:51.969 --> 02:21:53.710]  Go straight down from his nose.
[02:21:53.870 --> 02:21:54.471]  Twelve o'clock.
[02:21:54.811 --> 02:21:55.952]  Twelve o'clock, overhead.
[02:21:56.512 --> 02:22:01.475]  His eyes, both eye sockets are dark, which indicates also an overhead light source.
[02:22:01.795 --> 02:22:03.717]  So it's clearly a photograph that was staged.
[02:22:04.617 --> 02:22:11.101]  The interesting thing about that is the entire house was cleaned out the day of the assassination by the Dallas Police Department.
[02:22:11.161 --> 02:22:12.963]  Completely, every single thing.
[02:22:13.283 --> 02:22:16.785]  Every dish, every fork, every knife, every sheet, everything.
[02:22:17.065 --> 02:22:21.208]  And then two days later, suddenly someone goes back to the house and supposedly finds the photo in the house.
[02:22:21.568 --> 02:22:21.648]  It's
[02:22:40.346 --> 02:22:44.429]  All right, we don't have much time.
[02:22:44.529 --> 02:22:46.951]  I want to have you back sometime.
[02:22:46.991 --> 02:22:47.372]  No, no, no.
[02:22:47.412 --> 02:22:48.493]  I could have you for five hours.
[02:22:49.153 --> 02:22:53.417]  Shifting gears again, I believe we do have a space program that went to the moon.
[02:22:53.457 --> 02:22:59.402]  I've talked to top astronauts, but they wanted to fake some photos for the public to not show the public what we really have.
[02:22:59.702 --> 02:23:01.464]  What do you think of those moon photos?
[02:23:01.724 --> 02:23:06.267]  Well, I think the most interesting thing about the moon photos is that there are some problems with them.
[02:23:06.287 --> 02:23:07.888]  There are some definite problems with them.
[02:23:07.988 --> 02:23:13.451]  I've actually photographed Conrad Grissom and Harrison Schmitt.
[02:23:13.531 --> 02:23:16.413]  Harrison Schmitt was the last person that sat foot on the moon.
[02:23:16.473 --> 02:23:17.134]  Conrad, obviously.
[02:23:17.174 --> 02:23:17.834]  We've interviewed him.
[02:23:17.874 --> 02:23:18.514]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:23:18.635 --> 02:23:19.355]  Schmitt's amazing.
[02:23:19.395 --> 02:23:21.356]  Geologist.
[02:23:21.456 --> 02:23:22.317]  And the thing about it is,
[02:23:22.737 --> 02:23:22.957]  I think?
[02:23:45.775 --> 02:23:48.316]  It's backlit, and so the lens should be black.
[02:23:48.356 --> 02:23:50.016]  It shouldn't be illuminated, but it's illuminated.
[02:23:50.036 --> 02:23:51.857]  But instead, there's angles everywhere of light.
[02:23:51.877 --> 02:23:53.097]  Yeah, there's multiple shadows.
[02:23:53.117 --> 02:23:54.537]  There's directional shadows.
[02:23:54.817 --> 02:24:01.079]  There was a great photograph that NASA had, or a film image that they had released, which they've since pulled.
[02:24:01.099 --> 02:24:07.300]  You know, I think it got in under the radar, and some people got it, and they questioned it, and it got pulled of the flag on the moon blowing.
[02:24:07.601 --> 02:24:08.081]  Yes.
[02:24:08.121 --> 02:24:08.721]  No, you've seen that.
[02:24:08.861 --> 02:24:09.021]  Okay.
[02:24:09.321 --> 02:24:13.122]  So as a top photographer who knows the whole science of it, this is suspicious.
[02:24:13.542 --> 02:24:20.985]  It's suspicious, and you know, I've looked in that and watched the documentary, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon, which there's a lot more stuff on there that's really inconsistent.
[02:24:21.005 --> 02:24:25.406]  It was almost part of the same interest I had with the 9-11 stuff with the Pentagon.
[02:24:25.426 --> 02:24:26.947]  You know, something seemed weird.
[02:24:27.407 --> 02:24:28.648]  And we have a right to question it.
[02:24:29.228 --> 02:24:31.029]  Unfortunately, we're down to a minute and a half.
[02:24:31.049 --> 02:24:36.030]  Let's show the photo of his father here, and I describe what I got from it, that it's
[02:24:37.807 --> 02:24:43.913]  You know, it's almost like the Sistine Chapel where God's reaching down, but also he's old, he's wise, he's strong, but you said vulnerable.
[02:24:44.153 --> 02:24:47.617]  Yeah, I think there's a lot of vulnerability in that image, you know, especially in his eyes.
[02:24:48.297 --> 02:24:51.360]  You know, it looks like, to me, you know, that was a perfect photograph.
[02:24:51.380 --> 02:24:52.722]  That's my favorite that I've ever done.
[02:24:53.082 --> 02:24:57.346]  There are some of my son, actually, that would compete with that one for favorite photo.
[02:24:58.127 --> 02:24:59.349]  You know, he and I took a walk.
[02:24:59.649 --> 02:25:01.111]  I usually always have a camera with me.
[02:25:01.311 --> 02:25:06.817]  We took a walk out in his house in the high desert in California, and the light was absolutely stunning.
[02:25:06.857 --> 02:25:07.878]  There was a little breeze.
[02:25:07.978 --> 02:25:11.122]  It was one of those things where it's like, hey, can I do a portrait of you real quick, Dad?
[02:25:11.682 --> 02:25:16.307]  Yeah, you know, shot 10 frames, done, finished the walk, processed the film.
[02:25:17.408 --> 02:25:18.249]  Stunning, you know.
[02:25:18.269 --> 02:25:19.650]  You caught that magic moment.
[02:25:19.730 --> 02:25:19.950]  Perfect.
[02:25:19.970 --> 02:25:20.870]  I mean, the hair blowing.
[02:25:20.930 --> 02:25:22.471]  For me, it was really the magic moment.

[02:25:35.739 --> 02:25:36.240]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:25:36.480 --> 02:25:37.520]  Great seeing you again.

[02:25:43.164 --> 02:25:46.366]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[02:25:47.165 --> 02:25:48.426]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:25:48.466 --> 02:25:53.788]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:25:54.048 --> 02:25:58.670]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:25:59.070 --> 02:26:00.791]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold.
