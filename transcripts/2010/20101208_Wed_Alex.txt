[00:00:04.926 --> 00:00:09.770]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.351]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.351 --> 00:00:12.892]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.892 --> 00:00:17.096]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.096 --> 00:00:21.179]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.837 --> 00:00:50.604]  We've got Dr. Joseph Marcola joining us coming up in an hour to look at the fact that even the government and mainstream media have been forced to admit that not just bisphenol A but many other plastic and petrochemical compounds in food packaging
[00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:59.943]  are causing cancer, reduced fertility, brain damage, the list goes on and on.
[00:00:59.943 --> 00:01:09.229]  I remember more than a decade ago seeing mainline governmental and university studies where they would have rats and mice and guinea pigs
[00:01:10.402 --> 00:01:19.808]  Exposed to cell phone radiation while they were pregnant, and it would cause all sorts of lowered mental acuity in the rodents and other problems.
[00:01:19.808 --> 00:01:22.669]  And then they had other studies showing the same thing in humans.
[00:01:22.669 --> 00:01:26.171]  That's back in the news, back in mainstream news today.
[00:01:26.171 --> 00:01:30.574]  In fact, I've got an ABC News article on that front.
[00:01:30.574 --> 00:01:36.397]  We're gonna be talking about with Dr. Marcola as well, coming up in T-minus one hour.
[00:01:37.458 --> 00:01:42.160]  Attorney Gary Fielder, who was in studio with us, I don't know, five, six months ago.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.263]  He's the guy that filed suit over the naked body scanners in Denver.
[00:01:46.263 --> 00:01:48.264]  Now it's come out they are saving them.
[00:01:48.264 --> 00:01:51.525]  But he also pointed out that it was violating child porn laws to scan under 18.
[00:01:53.306 --> 00:02:00.813]  And so they've stopped scanning under 18 there, but they try to grope you, but he has filed a new injunction.
[00:02:00.813 --> 00:02:01.774]  Been served.
[00:02:01.774 --> 00:02:07.760]  A Colorado lawyer files for injunction against Cousin Janet and the TSA.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.783]  He's going to be popping in coming up in about 30 minutes.
[00:02:10.783 --> 00:02:12.544]  There's been some incredible new developments.
[00:02:13.585 --> 00:02:28.271]  It turns out, and Steve Watson has an article about this at PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com, that the TSA is concerned about radiation, and there's been some internal studies done by Homeland Security, but they're suppressing the findings of those studies.
[00:02:28.271 --> 00:02:36.354]  Well, we already have prestigious radiologists on record across the spectrum pointing out how dangerous these scanners are.
[00:02:37.583 --> 00:02:49.316]  Even one or two exposures, but that the people working around them are getting massive backscatter exposure and that is very, very dangerous and similar to a dental x-ray.
[00:02:49.316 --> 00:02:51.338]  You notice the dental x-ray, they put...
[00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:53.240]  Let's
[00:03:14.238 --> 00:03:14.518]  I think
[00:03:36.841 --> 00:03:45.163]  Seal on the coffin of these naked body scanners, which the feds are trying to roll out all over the streets of the United States.
[00:03:45.163 --> 00:03:57.805]  Also, the video I shot a few days ago, critical of Big Sis and the naked body scanners and Big Sis and the telescreens not just going in Walmart, but Mall of America.
[00:03:57.805 --> 00:04:05.327]  It's in the news that Target's involved with Homeland Security and basically donates money to put up face scanning cameras nationwide.
[00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:07.936]  I saw that in the news a few years ago.
[00:04:07.936 --> 00:04:09.382]  It's back in the news today, but...
[00:04:13.188 --> 00:04:24.231]  It's just incredible that the New York Observer and others savaged yours truly and basically implied that I'm completely crazy because I don't like this.
[00:04:24.231 --> 00:04:37.994]  But if you go to the official Homeland Security YouTube channel, they will have per video thousands of dislikes for what Janet Napolitano says is good, next to maybe 20, 30 likes.
[00:04:37.994 --> 00:04:39.855]  So we're talking hundreds to one
[00:04:41.001 --> 00:04:48.490]  And then you go to my videos, it'll be a thousand plus likes when I'm criticizing it versus eight dislikes.
[00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.176]  So almost no one is buying the establishment's attempted takeover, but they don't care.
[00:04:54.176 --> 00:04:56.599]  They still sit up there and say, all of you were crazy.
[00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:58.441]  Sticking our hands down your pants is good.
[00:04:58.441 --> 00:04:59.683]  Leaving the borders open is good.
[00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.614]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:05:05.614 --> 00:05:08.858]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:05:08.858 --> 00:05:14.024]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:05:14.024 --> 00:05:20.050]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.292]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:05:22.833 --> 00:05:23.133]  Tim Geithner?
[00:05:23.133 --> 00:05:23.633]  Bernanke?
[00:05:23.633 --> 00:05:24.434]  They're arsonists!
[00:05:24.434 --> 00:05:25.594]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:05:25.594 --> 00:05:27.835]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:46.104]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:05:46.104 --> 00:05:49.006]  we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:05:49.006 --> 00:05:58.133]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.071]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:06.071 --> 00:06:14.934]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:06:14.934 --> 00:06:19.555]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:06:19.555 --> 00:06:30.379]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:06:31.019 --> 00:06:40.521]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:40.521 --> 00:06:45.963]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:06:45.963 --> 00:06:53.444]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:53.444 --> 00:06:56.185]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:07:04.176 --> 00:07:05.437]  Tyranny is here.
[00:07:05.437 --> 00:07:08.981]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:07:08.981 --> 00:07:11.603]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:07:11.603 --> 00:07:17.489]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:07:17.489 --> 00:07:23.736]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:07:24.136 --> 00:07:30.117]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:07:30.117 --> 00:07:34.278]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:07:34.278 --> 00:07:38.579]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:07:38.579 --> 00:07:44.520]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.080]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.061]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:07:50.061 --> 00:07:50.481]  It's here.

[00:08:10.045 --> 00:08:11.626]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.626 --> 00:08:13.167]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.167 --> 00:08:17.370]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:21.453]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:32.756 --> 00:08:36.519]  It is Wednesday, the 8th day of December 2010.
[00:08:36.519 --> 00:08:41.542]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:08:41.542 --> 00:08:50.487]  Dr. Joseph Marcola, very informative, will be joining us coming up in the next hour, coming up in about 25 minutes.
[00:08:50.487 --> 00:08:52.969]  We're going to be looking in-depth
[00:08:54.049 --> 00:08:58.351]  at what is happening with the huge developments on the TSA front.
[00:08:58.351 --> 00:09:03.653]  Now a revolt by the TSA workers themselves over radiation concerns.
[00:09:03.653 --> 00:09:09.055]  And I think this is again potentially the final nail in the coffin.
[00:09:09.055 --> 00:09:12.116]  The globalists love to set incredible precedents.
[00:09:12.116 --> 00:09:22.740]  If they can put up telescreens telling you to spy and tattle on your neighbors, if they can put CIA commercials on television recruiting the general public to spy on each other, they'll do it.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.963]  They will turn us into the Soviet Union.
[00:09:25.963 --> 00:09:28.025]  If they can stick their hands down our pants, they'll do it.
[00:09:28.025 --> 00:09:32.830]  If they can take the veterans' pensions and health care, they'll do it and are doing it.
[00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:40.479]  If they can leave the borders wide open and let illegal aliens be above the law but throw the book at citizens for no reason, they'll do it and they are doing it.
[00:09:41.854 --> 00:09:48.977]  They are attempting to set the precedent to get away with anything and everything they want.
[00:09:48.977 --> 00:09:59.182]  But in their hubris and in their arrogant psychological warfare operation, I know they have reached too far and there is a huge revolt against this system.
[00:09:59.182 --> 00:10:05.985]  Last night I had two hours, the first two hours of Coast to Coast AM, amazing callers, incredible discussions.
[00:10:05.985 --> 00:10:10.968]  We had about WikiLeaks as more and more really crystallizes on that front.
[00:10:11.468 --> 00:10:29.083]  There's clearly skullduggery going on involved with WikiLeaks with the Cass Sunstein, George Soros connections and it just shows how they've set up Assange as the fall guy as they always do and that's becoming crystal clear and we've got some new developments on that front.
[00:10:30.034 --> 00:10:37.321]  That we are going to be discussing in detail coming up today.
[00:10:37.321 --> 00:10:42.325]  We also have a lot of important news on military front.
[00:10:42.325 --> 00:10:46.970]  North Korea fires artillery and its waters rattles financial markets.
[00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:55.538]  And we're going to go into, of course, what's happening with the financial markets, not just here in the United States, but all over the world.
[00:10:56.378 --> 00:11:08.984]  And I then have another important tidbit of news that I'm going to get into coming up briefly, but it's important in the third hour today.
[00:11:08.984 --> 00:11:13.146]  I talked to Governor Ventura this morning at some length
[00:11:14.418 --> 00:11:14.539]  And
[00:11:32.381 --> 00:11:49.159]  The November 12th premiere of Police State that got record ratings in this season for the broadcast for the transmission and they're not removing it and saying oh it's it's it's it's got wrong information they're not they're just saying nothing and I of course have the full story on what's going on.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:12:11.914]  Uh, but because someone involved in the attempt, uh, to scuttle the episode has now surfaced, uh, and now that it's public domain, uh, because again, I'm in confidence with people, with the show, I'm involved, I consult on it, and if they say we don't want to talk about this at this time,
[00:12:12.887 --> 00:12:16.050]  And then they give me this internal information.
[00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:18.172]  I can't violate that confidence.
[00:12:18.172 --> 00:12:21.675]  But I can read to you out of the newspaper.
[00:12:21.675 --> 00:12:26.779]  And I saw eight different mainstream news articles dealing with this.
[00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:27.981]  They're completely one-sided.
[00:12:27.981 --> 00:12:30.643]  They're completely deceptive.
[00:12:30.643 --> 00:12:35.127]  And so I will be talking about that coming up.
[00:12:38.402 --> 00:12:55.864]  Early in the third hour of the broadcast, because this integrates in with the FCC commissioner and others openly saying that freedom on talk radio, freedom on TV to have your own political views and to criticize government, that that's an aberration and that it's going to be banned.
[00:12:57.128 --> 00:12:58.369]  And they're taking over the Internet.
[00:12:58.369 --> 00:13:00.390]  They've declared they've got power over that.
[00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:04.052]  They're going to protect the airwaves and protect the Internet by taking our rights.
[00:13:04.052 --> 00:13:05.393]  The telescreens are going in.
[00:13:05.393 --> 00:13:19.001]  The CIA ads are all over the different CSI shows where all of the couch potatoes sit there drinking their fluoride water and taking their Prozac, dreaming about how they're spies and forensics officers.
[00:13:19.921 --> 00:13:23.702]  And that goes back to Ventura when he first became governor.
[00:13:23.702 --> 00:13:28.624]  He got called into the basement of the Capitol and there was 23 CIA agents in there.
[00:13:28.624 --> 00:13:33.126]  They were little old black ladies and little old white ladies and little nerdly looking men.
[00:13:33.126 --> 00:13:33.886]  They were his neighbors.
[00:13:35.307 --> 00:13:35.527]  I think?
[00:13:55.028 --> 00:13:57.250]  1.5 quadrillion worldwide.
[00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:59.212]  And they're just people on power trips.
[00:13:59.212 --> 00:13:59.793]  Can you imagine?
[00:13:59.793 --> 00:14:00.954]  They go into colleges.
[00:14:00.954 --> 00:14:05.778]  They recruit people who think they're so cool being secret agents working for a criminal government.
[00:14:05.778 --> 00:14:10.102]  They put out these images that they're all 007 James Bond.
[00:14:10.102 --> 00:14:10.803]  And what do they do?
[00:14:11.483 --> 00:14:15.486]  They go to our Patriot events and try to get us to fight with each other.
[00:14:15.486 --> 00:14:16.467]  They spy on us.
[00:14:16.467 --> 00:14:25.074]  They coordinate with the police departments on how to stage attacks in protest so the police can fire rubber bullets into peaceful crowds.
[00:14:25.074 --> 00:14:28.917]  They work on putting disinformation in local media.
[00:14:28.917 --> 00:14:32.540]  And it's just a completely private, criminal, corporate army.
[00:14:33.633 --> 00:14:37.595]  And now there's almost no oversight over the CIA or NSA.
[00:14:37.595 --> 00:14:41.417]  Now they're just moving on to private contractors doing whatever they want.
[00:14:41.417 --> 00:14:46.420]  They drive around with 500 mobile vans, looking through our walls, radiating themselves.
[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:47.341]  They don't care.
[00:14:47.341 --> 00:14:50.743]  The troops are being radiated and poisoned by the DU.
[00:14:50.743 --> 00:14:59.848]  And again, it's just a bunch of low IQ miscreants who get off on their CIA agents, their defense intelligence.
[00:14:59.848 --> 00:15:01.209]  And I've seen these goons.
[00:15:01.809 --> 00:15:10.616]  You know, so many times when I was covering Bilderberg in Canada or in the United States, there'd be some big shaved head guy, thinks he's tough, following you.
[00:15:10.616 --> 00:15:13.719]  You just stop the car and get out and they just run off.
[00:15:13.719 --> 00:15:14.820]  Look, you're crooks!
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:17.542]  You work for terrorist narcotics traffickers!
[00:15:17.542 --> 00:15:18.523]  I'm done with you!
[00:15:18.523 --> 00:15:20.204]  I'm not afraid of you and I don't care!
[00:15:20.204 --> 00:15:22.827]  I don't care if you blow my head off tomorrow!
[00:15:23.547 --> 00:15:24.648]  I enjoy life.
[00:15:24.648 --> 00:15:25.428]  I love it.
[00:15:25.428 --> 00:15:26.568]  But you know what?
[00:15:26.568 --> 00:15:31.491]  I'm deep down completely against being a coward and living in the Soviet Union.
[00:15:31.491 --> 00:15:32.491]  Okay?
[00:15:32.491 --> 00:15:35.333]  So, I'm sick of the heroin and cocaine you ship in.
[00:15:35.333 --> 00:15:43.496]  I'm sick of the Congressional hearings about your DynCorp Halliburton fronts running giant kidnapping rings of small children and selling them to the Saudis and others.
[00:15:43.496 --> 00:15:44.437]  I'm done.
[00:15:44.437 --> 00:15:47.078]  You work for an evil, out-of-control group.
[00:15:47.078 --> 00:15:48.919]  I don't care how compartmentalized you are.
[00:15:49.379 --> 00:16:08.371]  Look, if you're not a crook working for the FBI or CIA or all these other agencies, then you're a compartmentalized Dudley do-right who they've got paper-pushing or who takes some of the public service type PR front jobs, and you're a joke to all the psychopathic, sadistic criminals that you work with, okay?
[00:16:08.371 --> 00:16:11.794]  You are a joke to them.
[00:16:11.794 --> 00:16:12.414]  Understand that.
[00:16:14.127 --> 00:16:16.295]  And I, I'm just done.
[00:16:16.295 --> 00:16:19.668]  I'm done with your Orwellian PSYOP and they think they're smarter than us.
[00:16:21.311 --> 00:16:22.912]  They get off on dumbing us down.
[00:16:22.912 --> 00:16:25.794]  They get off on all the crimes they get to commit.
[00:16:25.794 --> 00:16:33.020]  They are recruiting basically the equivalent of brown shirts to the CIA as auxiliary tattletale assets.
[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:35.041]  That's what the threat fusion centers are.
[00:16:35.041 --> 00:16:41.646]  They are literally going and hiring low IQ miscreants who get off on all of this.
[00:16:41.646 --> 00:16:45.289]  And it's time to stand up to these crooks.
[00:16:45.289 --> 00:16:47.991]  It's time to stand up to the Stasi and go, look,
[00:16:48.351 --> 00:16:54.179]  We know your bad news, we know your villains, and we're done playing games with you.
[00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:58.304]  We are completely through playing games with you.
[00:16:58.304 --> 00:17:03.511]  Let me just run through some of the news headlines here today dealing with police state, okay?
[00:17:05.037 --> 00:17:09.420]  CBS News, Walmart interested in wine vending machines.
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:12.783]  Now, Steve Watson wrote about this about a year ago.
[00:17:12.783 --> 00:17:20.609]  All over the country and in England, they make you breathalyzer, thumbprint, swipe a license to buy wine or beer.
[00:17:21.858 --> 00:17:30.805]  Also, a lot of new grocery stores are coming out in Europe and the United States, where there is nothing but a security guard there, and everything is a vending machine.
[00:17:30.805 --> 00:17:46.038]  Milk, razors, cookies, lettuce, everything is surveilled, and there's a few security guards there, and you're being face scanned the whole time, and that data's all being sold, and it's being databased what you purchased, and your psychological profile, that's all admitted now.
[00:17:46.678 --> 00:17:48.059]  And this is the new system.
[00:17:48.059 --> 00:17:57.649]  You will not be able to go into any store or facility and buy anything without thumbprinting and swiping your license, just like the no-fly list, the no-gun-buy list.
[00:17:57.649 --> 00:17:58.710]  This is all admitted.
[00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:00.472]  This is the mark of the beast.
[00:18:00.472 --> 00:18:08.039]  And even if you're not a Christian and don't believe in all of that, the issue is the government's used this as a template and said, that sounds like a great way to enslave people.
[00:18:08.039 --> 00:18:08.500]  Let's do it.
[00:18:10.123 --> 00:18:17.568]  And it goes on to say, why don't they just sell wine like they do in stores instead of using a machine where you put your cards and things in?
[00:18:17.568 --> 00:18:21.430]  Asked Betty Menke of Cecil.
[00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:30.255]  Well, that's why for over 15 years they've been asking for IDs of 85-year-old women on walkers buying a six-pack of Pabst Blue Ribbon.
[00:18:30.255 --> 00:18:31.476]  I've witnessed that.
[00:18:31.476 --> 00:18:39.261]  That's why I've seen old men at Walgreens who look like they're about to die buying a bag of pipe tobacco.
[00:18:40.936 --> 00:18:44.258]  And the young zit-faced clerk asking for it.
[00:18:44.258 --> 00:19:00.185]  I've read the corporate change agent documents that are public, where they admitted they're getting you ready to have to swipe a card to buy anything, because they're also gonna have a sales tax that's graduated, so they're gonna have to swipe your card to confirm what tax bracket you're in.
[00:19:00.185 --> 00:19:02.106]  They got all the fake conservatives pushing that.
[00:19:02.106 --> 00:19:08.989]  They're gonna have the sales tax and the income tax, and a VAT financial tax, and a carbon tax, if we put up with it.
[00:19:10.538 --> 00:19:14.962]  But I mean, look, I have a huge stack of these police state articles.
[00:19:14.962 --> 00:19:16.043]  Okay?
[00:19:16.043 --> 00:19:18.665]  Now, these vending machines are going in everywhere.
[00:19:18.665 --> 00:19:21.408]  And it's total control.
[00:19:21.408 --> 00:19:23.269]  All right, so it's just social conditioning.
[00:19:23.269 --> 00:19:24.691]  It's dog training.
[00:19:24.691 --> 00:19:25.732]  Oh, come on!
[00:19:25.732 --> 00:19:28.274]  We've been swiping our cards for years to buy wine.
[00:19:28.274 --> 00:19:33.879]  Why not have to swipe your card to, you know, buy some clothes?
[00:19:33.879 --> 00:19:36.541]  I mean, after all, you gotta make sure you're not cheating on your sales taxes.
[00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:39.933]  When we come back, I'm going to get into more of these.
[00:19:39.933 --> 00:19:42.534]  A granny got a $100 ticket.
[00:19:42.534 --> 00:19:45.797]  A cop saw her throw her newspaper in the trash can.
[00:19:45.797 --> 00:19:47.618]  See, that was an environmental infraction.
[00:19:47.618 --> 00:19:49.179]  The Green Police.
[00:19:49.179 --> 00:19:50.900]  Meanwhile, the borders are wide open.
[00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.682]  The megabanks have stolen tens of trillions of dollars.
[00:19:53.682 --> 00:19:55.123]  They're cutting the veterans' benefits.
[00:19:55.123 --> 00:19:59.646]  But that's okay, because in New York, if you sit on a bench more than five minutes, they arrest you.
[00:20:01.015 --> 00:20:02.118]  Pure water.
[00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:04.825]  What could be better than the gift of health for your loved ones?

[00:21:29.523 --> 00:21:30.764]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:30.764 --> 00:21:35.347]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:21:35.347 --> 00:21:41.151]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:21:41.151 --> 00:21:44.793]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:44.793 --> 00:21:47.615]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:47.615 --> 00:21:52.578]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[00:22:03.946 --> 00:22:05.207]  Tyranny is here.
[00:22:05.207 --> 00:22:09.150]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:11.371]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:22:11.371 --> 00:22:17.236]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:22:17.236 --> 00:22:23.480]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:29.861]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:22:29.861 --> 00:22:34.042]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:22:34.042 --> 00:22:38.343]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:22:38.343 --> 00:22:44.284]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:22:44.284 --> 00:22:47.844]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:22:47.844 --> 00:22:49.805]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:22:49.805 --> 00:22:50.245]  It's here.

[00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:58.037]  Season's greetings and health and wellness from Excalibur Dehydrator.
[00:24:05.283 --> 00:24:14.928]  See, we have a private corporate group of criminals that's hijacked our nation, written the laws where they can basically get away with bloody murder.
[00:24:14.928 --> 00:24:22.232]  They stage terror attacks, they provocateur attacks, they allow attacks to take place, so they can pose as our saviors.
[00:24:22.232 --> 00:24:28.275]  So they can be on telescreens in public places and shopping malls, telling you to watch your neighbors.
[00:24:29.864 --> 00:24:47.774]  And in essence telling you, you the citizens are bad, and you better answer our questions, and you better go through our police checkpoint, and you better give us a blood sample, you'd better give up all your rights, because you are inherently bad, but we the government, we are good.
[00:24:47.774 --> 00:24:50.055]  Well, history shows that to be a fraud.
[00:24:50.055 --> 00:24:54.758]  Modern evidence shows it to be a manifest, complete, and total fraud.
[00:24:57.142 --> 00:25:09.008]  They're going in worldwide with vending machines, and they have German shopping centers where it's almost completely vending machines, or computer-tracked, where you check everything out yourself.
[00:25:09.008 --> 00:25:11.409]  This is the total control grid.
[00:25:11.409 --> 00:25:21.514]  Gotta thumb scan, gotta swipe a card, gotta breathalyzer to be able to buy your liquor, but it's now phasing into everything.
[00:25:21.514 --> 00:25:26.356]  Here's the New York Post, granny's $100 ticket for throwing out newspaper.
[00:25:28.137 --> 00:25:29.139]  And it starts with this.
[00:25:29.139 --> 00:25:30.641]  It's, oh, you can't have this toilet.
[00:25:30.641 --> 00:25:31.562]  You can have that toilet.
[00:25:31.562 --> 00:25:32.784]  You can't have this washing machine.
[00:25:32.784 --> 00:25:34.386]  You can have that washing machine.
[00:25:34.386 --> 00:25:35.688]  You can't have those light bulbs.
[00:25:37.239 --> 00:25:40.421]  Oh, now you've got to have a federal home inspection.
[00:25:40.421 --> 00:25:43.924]  And you've got to now move out of your house.
[00:25:43.924 --> 00:25:46.125]  I mean, this is all what the feds are pushing.
[00:25:46.125 --> 00:25:51.069]  In Germany, they've now officially banned single-family dwellings in the future.
[00:25:51.069 --> 00:25:54.411]  You must live in government dormitory-style houses.
[00:25:54.411 --> 00:25:57.053]  This is the total re-engineering of society.
[00:25:57.053 --> 00:25:58.354]  Have you figured that out yet?
[00:25:58.354 --> 00:26:00.916]  They admit that's what environmentalism is now.
[00:26:00.916 --> 00:26:06.000]  It's an anti-human crusade by the elites to train us to be feudal prisoners.
[00:26:09.042 --> 00:26:12.283]  Granny's $100 ticket for throwing out newspaper, New York Post.
[00:26:12.283 --> 00:26:20.724]  An elderly Manhattan woman living on social security was slapped with a $100 ticket just for throwing away a newspaper in the city's trash can.
[00:26:20.724 --> 00:26:26.785]  But you notice the police don't stop all the hookers on the street corners everywhere in New York that are ubiquitous.
[00:26:26.785 --> 00:26:29.326]  Oh, because they're getting a good fat cut of that.
[00:26:29.326 --> 00:26:32.906]  They don't stop DynCorp flying in the child sex slaves, which are on record.
[00:26:32.906 --> 00:26:34.407]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:26:34.407 --> 00:26:36.287]  They give the cattle tickets.
[00:26:37.674 --> 00:26:50.087]  And it says that Delia Gluckin, 80, tossed the paper into a bin right outside her Inwood apartment building Sunday morning, only to be ambushed by an overzealous Department of Sanitation agent wielding a citation book.
[00:26:51.696 --> 00:26:57.682]  I was walking to take the subway down and dropped it in the trash can and the lady in blue uniform ran up to me.
[00:26:57.682 --> 00:27:07.212]  Yeah, there's all those famous videos that activists shoot on YouTube in New York where the police and firemen and others all park illegally in their own private cars and no one will give them a ticket.
[00:27:07.813 --> 00:27:16.498]  It's kinda like in California, there's over a million government names that are blacked out of the list, and the license plate reading cameras are not allowed to scan them.
[00:27:16.498 --> 00:27:21.501]  They're deleted automatically, and so they get to speed and not pay tolls.
[00:27:21.501 --> 00:27:25.703]  But see, just like government gets to go around the TSA scanners.
[00:27:25.703 --> 00:27:29.385]  This is the new America.
[00:27:29.385 --> 00:27:31.507]  I thought she was gonna ask for directions, she said.
[00:27:31.507 --> 00:27:35.309]  You just dropped the garbage in there, she went on to talk about how she yelled at her.
[00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:37.940]  Now, here's another one.
[00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:42.142]  Fingerprint scanner use raises privacy concerns in North Carolina.
[00:27:42.142 --> 00:27:49.624]  And it goes into 13 law enforcement agencies under a federal grant are getting thumb scanners and now anybody pulled over is going to be scanned.
[00:27:49.624 --> 00:27:57.706]  But an illegal alien won't be in the database and they're allowed to drunk drive and if they commit murders they're pretty much released after just a few months in many cases.
[00:27:58.206 --> 00:28:08.020]  I mean, the Houston Chronicle reported a quarter million illegal aliens released just a few years ago in one year in Texas, many of them violent, aggravated felons.
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:09.562]  Rape, arson, manslaughter.
[00:28:10.953 --> 00:28:24.805]  But you, the cattle, you gotta get used to giving those thumbprints at the gym, or the tanning salon, or at the library, or to get your school lunch, because it's been stated by the big biometric consortiums on record, you're going to do this worldwide.
[00:28:24.805 --> 00:28:28.968]  They're gonna debase all the global currencies, create the SDR that now the U.S.
[00:28:28.968 --> 00:28:32.391]  Postal Service and UPS list their international shipments in.
[00:28:32.391 --> 00:28:33.072]  This is on record.
[00:28:33.692 --> 00:28:38.396]  The Texas Workforce Commission two years ago sent me a letter saying I'm now under the North American Union.
[00:28:38.396 --> 00:28:45.283]  I report to the North American Union office, not to the feds anymore, on my employees and unemployment insurance.
[00:28:45.283 --> 00:28:46.684]  That was also in World Net Daily.
[00:28:46.684 --> 00:28:49.266]  Of course he got a copy of it from another business.
[00:28:49.266 --> 00:28:51.028]  I think it was in California.
[00:28:51.028 --> 00:28:52.889]  But the point is, we're already here.
[00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:58.733]  And then it's just, well, you can still have cash creds, but those are issued basically by banks.
[00:28:58.733 --> 00:29:05.638]  There'll be hundreds of currencies that are paper, but based on SDRs, but we got a global sales tax and a regional sales tax.
[00:29:05.638 --> 00:29:10.221]  You got a thumbprint and face scan to activate it.
[00:29:10.221 --> 00:29:17.566]  And the feds are running in Mexico and the US and Canada test cities where they're trying to make everyone do this.
[00:29:17.566 --> 00:29:18.727]  This is their control grid.
[00:29:19.747 --> 00:29:20.107]  Okay?
[00:29:20.107 --> 00:29:23.629]  I mean, they're not playing games, so there's a McClatchy News article on that.
[00:29:23.629 --> 00:29:24.209]  Here's another one.
[00:29:24.209 --> 00:29:26.750]  UPS requires photo ID for shipping.
[00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:31.212]  Because, you know, the terrorist might be trying to mail something.
[00:29:31.212 --> 00:29:39.055]  Even though they have bomb-sniffing dogs and x-ray machines, and even though we know who's mailing those bombs 99% of the time, it's the same folks protecting us.
[00:29:39.055 --> 00:29:39.735]  Oh, but don't worry.
[00:29:39.735 --> 00:29:42.796]  There's new IRS rules coming in this January.
[00:29:42.796 --> 00:29:46.478]  Now they're just making public what's already been in place for at least 15 years.
[00:29:46.478 --> 00:29:48.179]  I'll tell you about that briefly when we come back.
[00:29:48.179 --> 00:29:48.599]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.765 --> 00:29:54.694]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.694 --> 00:29:57.360]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.591 --> 00:30:04.332]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:04.332 --> 00:30:10.057]  You've heard me talk about the delicious, easy-to-fix, and very storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:30:10.057 --> 00:30:14.801]  I've told you for years that eFoodsDirect has the best storable food on the planet.
[00:30:14.801 --> 00:30:18.544]  Now it's that time of year again, and their holiday special is here.
[00:30:18.544 --> 00:30:25.490]  They have two holiday price packs for you to put into your reserves for a secure future or to share with others.
[00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:28.773]  The first is a six-month bulk supply in 10 cans.
[00:30:29.233 --> 00:30:36.778]  And the second is a five-week supply of quick and easy-to-fix meals, including delicious bakery items shipped in heavy tote bags.
[00:30:36.778 --> 00:30:43.843]  Now, for a limited time, when you order two or more of these special holiday packs, you'll get free shipping on your entire order.

[00:30:48.065 --> 00:30:50.447]  That's 800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:31:00.165 --> 00:31:04.708]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[00:31:04.708 --> 00:31:05.628]  Number one.
[00:31:05.628 --> 00:31:09.051]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:09.051 --> 00:31:09.911]  Number two.
[00:31:09.911 --> 00:31:14.814]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:14.814 --> 00:31:15.555]  It's true.
[00:31:15.555 --> 00:31:20.418]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:20.418 --> 00:31:21.258]  Number three.
[00:31:21.258 --> 00:31:24.841]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:24.841 --> 00:31:28.543]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:28.743 --> 00:31:29.544]  Number 4.
[00:31:29.544 --> 00:31:32.307]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:32.307 --> 00:31:35.991]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:35.991 --> 00:31:36.772]  Number 5.
[00:31:36.772 --> 00:31:40.917]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:40.917 --> 00:31:45.682]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:45.962 --> 00:31:50.124]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:32:52.107 --> 00:32:52.628]  Thank you.
[00:33:11.038 --> 00:33:15.660]  This is our land.
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:18.982]  These are our people.
[00:33:18.982 --> 00:33:19.742]  The workers.
[00:33:19.742 --> 00:33:22.844]  The strivers.
[00:33:22.844 --> 00:33:25.525]  The builders.
[00:33:25.525 --> 00:33:27.486]  These are our people.
[00:33:27.486 --> 00:33:32.329]  Who are they?
[00:33:32.329 --> 00:33:34.230]  They are the dark armies.
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:36.460]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:39.361]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:16.613]  Yesterday I called up Homeland Security with the public tattletale phone line where they're looking for operatives to spy on their neighbors, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians as their main target.
[00:34:16.613 --> 00:34:23.235]  And I tried to read him mainstream news articles, the FBI agent, about Anwar al-Awlaki, the admitted head
[00:34:24.702 --> 00:34:25.963]  We're good to go.
[00:34:41.018 --> 00:34:56.845]  But again, our government will shoot up children with syphilis and polio and nerve gas our own troops, but they would, and that's all on record, and radiate foster children to death, but they would never stage a 9-11 attack.
[00:34:56.845 --> 00:35:03.769]  Sure, in one study, they radiated 4,000 plus children to death, little foster children they took.
[00:35:05.155 --> 00:35:05.395]  I think?
[00:35:35.515 --> 00:35:46.363]  And again, this is in Congressional hearings, but I mean, I've had family who was recruited by the CIA, who got out of it because they were told to traffic narcotics in the U.S.
[00:35:46.363 --> 00:35:47.343]  Okay?
[00:35:47.343 --> 00:35:50.666]  They count on you being sheep-like, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:50.666 --> 00:35:52.227]  Stop being sheep-like.
[00:35:52.227 --> 00:35:56.970]  And if you're a sheep-like CIA person or FBI getting mad right now, you're a little kid.
[00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:58.291]  You're a baby.
[00:35:58.291 --> 00:35:58.511]  Okay?
[00:35:58.511 --> 00:36:03.415]  If you're sitting there going, this isn't true, don't say that, you are an idiot.
[00:36:04.625 --> 00:36:08.627]  Okay, everything I've said here is on record.
[00:36:08.627 --> 00:36:09.627]  Let's go ahead and play that ad.
[00:36:09.627 --> 00:36:16.190]  Here it is.
[00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:20.812]  Some heroes are inspired by the mission, not the recognition.
[00:36:20.812 --> 00:36:22.133]  What about you?
[00:36:22.133 --> 00:36:25.714]  Consider a career with the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:36:25.714 --> 00:36:28.355]  Be America's first line of defense.
[00:36:28.355 --> 00:36:29.816]  Be your innovative best.
[00:36:32.515 --> 00:36:37.417]  Why work for a company when you can serve your nation?
[00:36:37.417 --> 00:36:42.399]  The CIA, the work of a nation, the center of intelligence.
[00:36:42.399 --> 00:36:47.562]  Yeah, the work of the nation.
[00:36:47.562 --> 00:36:55.505]  Being part of a quasi-government private army running around, overthrowing governments, overthrowing our government in 1963, blowing Kennedy's head off.
[00:36:58.499 --> 00:37:03.860]  And we're all supposed to be in awe of secret agents because of all the TV shows and movies.
[00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:08.461]  I'm not in awe of any of it but your crimes.
[00:37:08.461 --> 00:37:10.902]  And let it be remembered, I'm a liberty lover.
[00:37:10.902 --> 00:37:12.342]  I'm someone who wants freedom.
[00:37:12.342 --> 00:37:15.763]  I'm someone who can recognize corruption.
[00:37:15.763 --> 00:37:19.403]  I was watching some of their ads and it's like, do you like ambiguity?
[00:37:19.403 --> 00:37:24.724]  I mean, that's telling you right there.
[00:37:24.724 --> 00:37:27.265]  Do you like being a crook?
[00:37:28.493 --> 00:37:30.035]  Well, join the CIA.
[00:37:30.035 --> 00:37:33.058]  All right, I'm done ranting about this.
[00:37:33.058 --> 00:37:41.148]  We've got some big developments on the TSA front I'm going to get to here in a few minutes with our guest.
[00:37:41.148 --> 00:37:43.951]  But just recapping what I was getting into.
[00:37:43.951 --> 00:37:46.814]  Walmart interested in wine vending machines.
[00:37:47.725 --> 00:37:51.907]  We got a breathalyzer and biometrically scan and scan your driver's license.
[00:37:51.907 --> 00:37:57.371]  This is going in all over the world, getting you ready for the Cashless Society and the National Sales Act.
[00:37:57.371 --> 00:38:03.014]  Granny ticketed $100 for throwing out newspaper in New York.
[00:38:03.014 --> 00:38:04.355]  The Green Police.
[00:38:04.355 --> 00:38:07.737]  Fingerprint scanner use raises privacy concerns.
[00:38:07.737 --> 00:38:12.840]  They're going to thumb scan anybody pulled over in America.
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:16.061]  UPS requires photo ID for shipping.
[00:38:16.061 --> 00:38:16.222]  CNN.
[00:38:17.793 --> 00:38:19.054]  Now here's the last one.
[00:38:19.054 --> 00:38:21.516]  New rules!
[00:38:21.516 --> 00:38:23.477]  You and the IRS this January.
[00:38:23.477 --> 00:38:34.846]  The new Obamacare 1099 rule for reporting of all cash, credit, and check business transactions of $600 or more is scheduled to begin in January.
[00:38:34.846 --> 00:38:40.931]  This is really an extension of the 2008 Housing and Recovery Act IRS rules that start this January.
[00:38:41.471 --> 00:38:53.200]  When merchant banks and PayPal will report business sales directly to the IRS, the reporting threshold is $20,000 or 200 transactions a year.
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:57.943]  So the smallest businesses online are getting 200 transactions a year.
[00:38:57.943 --> 00:39:02.006]  Most little eBay accounts have 200 transactions a year.
[00:39:02.006 --> 00:39:06.229]  So what did they just calmly report there?
[00:39:06.229 --> 00:39:08.671]  This is being reported by the AP Reuters like it's a great thing.
[00:39:10.114 --> 00:39:17.456]  They just reported there with a straight face that everything you're doing in your business is being sent directly to the government.
[00:39:17.456 --> 00:39:19.977]  No judge, no jury, no warrant.
[00:39:19.977 --> 00:39:22.278]  But what did Wired Magazine report last week?
[00:39:22.278 --> 00:39:23.579]  All your credit cards.
[00:39:23.579 --> 00:39:25.939]  All your customer loyalty cards.
[00:39:25.939 --> 00:39:31.801]  Those companies are all being paid to run that directly through the government.
[00:39:31.801 --> 00:39:35.202]  This is more intrusive than the fictitious 1984 or the real East German Stasi.
[00:39:41.328 --> 00:39:41.408]  Yes.
[00:39:59.284 --> 00:40:03.890]  And they can use this to track you, to control you, to, you know, Google.
[00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:06.915]  When you go put something in Google, oh, I'm getting answers.
[00:40:06.915 --> 00:40:09.999]  Well, they're getting answers about you building that dossier.
[00:40:09.999 --> 00:40:13.244]  They are an admitted CIA NSA creation.
[00:40:13.244 --> 00:40:14.465]  So is Walmart, folks.
[00:40:15.472 --> 00:40:24.036]  From the beginning, Sam Walton, you can go to the research, CIA set up, they use their couriers and trucks for you can imagine what.
[00:40:24.036 --> 00:40:25.377]  It's a mafia.
[00:40:25.377 --> 00:40:30.739]  So of course they're involved in the adoption of RFID and the Universal Product Code.
[00:40:30.739 --> 00:40:32.680]  Of course they're the first to put in telescreens.
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:34.962]  It's not just going to be Janet giving you orders.
[00:40:34.962 --> 00:40:38.827]  It's going to be endless streams of, look for this person, look for that person.
[00:40:38.827 --> 00:40:46.477]  They're coming out with license plates that have government messages on them saying the license plate is the government's property on your car.
[00:40:46.477 --> 00:40:48.900]  This is all happening.
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:51.964]  And it's run by a government on record.
[00:40:53.755 --> 00:41:05.400]  In congressional hearings in 2004-2005 that allows Dinecore and Halliburton to run giant industrial sex slave rackets, white slavery with women and children.
[00:41:06.866 --> 00:41:07.926]  And no one gets in trouble.
[00:41:07.926 --> 00:41:10.087]  I mean, these are the worst people.
[00:41:10.087 --> 00:41:18.249]  And they look at anybody who isn't pure evil as a schmuck, as an adult, as an idiot, as, this is the way it is.
[00:41:18.249 --> 00:41:22.230]  And they've got endless armies of control freaks who love it.
[00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:26.451]  That's why they've tried to corrupt society so that good people wouldn't stand up against them.
[00:41:26.451 --> 00:41:34.873]  So, when you sign on to this criminal government, you sign on to children being raped and then having their heads blown off with 357 Magnums and snuff films.
[00:41:36.394 --> 00:41:37.574]  That's what goes on, okay?
[00:41:37.574 --> 00:41:39.135]  That's who runs this country.
[00:41:39.135 --> 00:41:41.296]  People that like to blow children's heads off.
[00:41:41.296 --> 00:41:44.617]  People that like to rape children in front of their parents.
[00:41:44.617 --> 00:41:48.118]  That's in the Army's own report on Abu Ghraib.
[00:41:48.118 --> 00:41:50.019]  And Bush says he'd do it all over again.
[00:41:50.019 --> 00:41:51.079]  He'd give the orders again.
[00:41:51.079 --> 00:41:52.400]  John Hughes orders.
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:56.161]  Alberta Gonzalez memo about crushing children's testicles with pliers.
[00:41:57.915 --> 00:41:59.976]  That is land of the free, home of the brave.
[00:41:59.976 --> 00:42:06.977]  And Americans watch Jack Bauer doing similar things and fantasize about it and become synthetic psychopaths.
[00:42:06.977 --> 00:42:10.358]  We are on a journey into absolute hell.
[00:42:10.358 --> 00:42:13.559]  And they're trying to test us now to see if we go along with it.
[00:42:13.559 --> 00:42:16.040]  All right, I'm done ranting.
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.420]  Our guest is on hold.
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:19.520]  Big developments on the TSA front.
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:21.781]  And if you're doubting me, the Army's own reports.
[00:42:21.781 --> 00:42:25.562]  I've had the former head of the Army DU program on, Dr. Doug Rocky, physicist and doctor.
[00:42:28.732 --> 00:42:39.202]  Their own reports that are public said you breathe in a few microns of this, you're going to get lung cancer, you're going to get liver cancer, you're going to get urethra cancer, you're going to get kidney cancer.
[00:42:39.202 --> 00:42:40.023]  It's going to kill you.
[00:42:40.023 --> 00:42:43.066]  It may take 10 years.
[00:42:43.066 --> 00:42:45.589]  They started using it 20 years ago, now they use it everywhere.
[00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:46.509]  They just don't care.
[00:42:47.318 --> 00:42:52.021]  Just like they don't care these radiation scanners are going to end up killing the people that are using them.
[00:42:52.021 --> 00:42:59.246]  Just like they got 500 mobile vans, super high power, that dwarf chest x-rays, looking through your walls, no shielding for the operators.
[00:42:59.246 --> 00:42:59.947]  They don't care.
[00:42:59.947 --> 00:43:06.011]  They know the operators are in a self-induced, mind-control, television culture trance.
[00:43:06.011 --> 00:43:06.431]  Think about it.
[00:43:06.431 --> 00:43:09.814]  People are actually in a trance, and they will get in those vehicles and kill themselves.
[00:43:11.873 --> 00:43:14.675]  Almost all of them, within just a few years, will come down with cancer.
[00:43:14.675 --> 00:43:17.358]  We've had medical doctors on, and radiologists.
[00:43:17.358 --> 00:43:18.659]  They don't care.
[00:43:18.659 --> 00:43:29.107]  If they can run child kidnapping rings, and have the troops breathe DU, and announce they're going to take the troops' healthcare away... We're in a soft-kill concentration camp.
[00:43:29.107 --> 00:43:30.268]  Okay?
[00:43:30.268 --> 00:43:31.849]  But they're not ready to move yet.
[00:43:31.849 --> 00:43:33.930]  They're starting to announce they want to censor the web.
[00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:36.512]  They're starting to announce they want to censor the internet.
[00:43:36.512 --> 00:43:38.694]  They're starting to be more bold.
[00:43:38.694 --> 00:43:39.555]  Because they're getting ready.
[00:43:40.555 --> 00:43:42.160]  And they're going to stage false flag attacks.
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:42.902]  I talked to Ventura.
[00:43:42.902 --> 00:43:43.704]  He said he could feel it.
[00:43:43.704 --> 00:43:44.888]  He could see it getting ready.
[00:43:44.888 --> 00:43:46.633]  I agree with him this morning.
[00:43:46.633 --> 00:43:47.535]  They're going to go for broke.
[00:43:48.525 --> 00:43:56.749]  And you'll see all the American flags go out and all the worship of the Homeland Security neighborhood spies when they nuke a city, or when they release a bioweapon.
[00:43:56.749 --> 00:44:01.152]  And I'm telling you, they're the ones that are behind it, just like they're behind everything else.
[00:44:01.152 --> 00:44:16.060]  And all you TSA people, and all you FBI people, and you CIA folks that are compartmentalized and think you're the good guys, so you were put in a different compartment on the white side, you better grow up right now and realize, and look, you intellectually know I'm telling you the truth, in your gut,
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:19.042]  You've got a survival instinct God gave you.
[00:44:19.042 --> 00:44:21.003]  You know this is real.
[00:44:21.003 --> 00:44:22.805]  From the heart.
[00:44:22.805 --> 00:44:24.786]  You know I'm risking my life to do this.
[00:44:24.786 --> 00:44:25.687]  It's not a risk.
[00:44:25.687 --> 00:44:27.909]  I care about this species.
[00:44:27.909 --> 00:44:30.391]  Even more than I care about my wife and children.
[00:44:30.391 --> 00:44:33.873]  Because they don't have a future if I don't stand up.
[00:44:33.873 --> 00:44:36.095]  And we're all in danger and that's the way it is.
[00:44:36.095 --> 00:44:37.176]  And I'm all in.
[00:44:37.176 --> 00:44:38.297]  I'm like God.
[00:44:38.297 --> 00:44:39.598]  I'm going in all the way.
[00:44:39.598 --> 00:44:40.739]  I'm hardcore.
[00:44:40.739 --> 00:44:41.739]  Energize me.
[00:44:41.739 --> 00:44:42.160]  I'm ready!
[00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:45.092]  That's the end of it, terrorists!
[00:44:45.092 --> 00:44:46.074]  Child rapers!
[00:44:46.074 --> 00:44:47.496]  We're coming for you!
[00:44:47.496 --> 00:44:48.938]  You understand that?
[00:44:48.938 --> 00:44:56.828]  You may use your 501c3 brainwashed churches to tell Christians it's the end of the world, so they stand down and go along with this, but we're gonna rebuke you.
[00:44:56.828 --> 00:44:58.310]  Alright, I'm done ranting.
[00:44:59.211 --> 00:45:03.894]  And I'm sorry to have our guest holding, we'll hold him five minutes to the next hour, the head of Dr. Marcola.
[00:45:03.894 --> 00:45:06.936]  But I wanted to get an update from Gary Fielder, Law.com.
[00:45:06.936 --> 00:45:10.158]  Gary Fielder, criminal and constitutional lawyer from Denver.
[00:45:10.158 --> 00:45:14.261]  He sued and got him to stop body scanning under 18s at the courthouse.
[00:45:14.261 --> 00:45:16.502]  He's done a lot more on that front.
[00:45:16.502 --> 00:45:21.025]  And now he has filed for injunction against Cousin Janet and the TSA.
[00:45:21.025 --> 00:45:24.447]  And I wanted to get an update from him on what he's doing.
[00:45:24.447 --> 00:45:25.848]  Gary, good to have you on with us.
[00:45:26.872 --> 00:45:30.454]  Mr. Alex Jones, thank you so much for having me on your show.
[00:45:30.454 --> 00:45:33.315]  What do you think of the stuff I just covered in the last five minutes?
[00:45:33.315 --> 00:45:36.957]  Well, that was an eye-opening experience.
[00:45:36.957 --> 00:45:46.122]  Every time I listen to your show, I learn more and more and more, and there's not a part of it that I can say you're exaggerating one millimeter.
[00:45:46.122 --> 00:45:47.783]  It's coming down the line.
[00:45:47.783 --> 00:45:52.026]  All of us see it, from grandma to the little kid.
[00:45:52.026 --> 00:45:54.227]  They all see it, and all you've got to do is point it out.
[00:45:55.134 --> 00:46:02.695]  For example, when you talk about TV, anybody that watches TV ought to know that they're being brainwashed at a very sophisticated level.
[00:46:03.251 --> 00:46:12.597]  And so when you're walking around Walmart, you might even consciously disagree with what you're hearing or what you're seeing, but they're bombarding our subconscious.
[00:46:12.597 --> 00:46:13.497]  Yes.
[00:46:13.497 --> 00:46:22.963]  And they're implanting it in a very sophisticated way to keep our subconscious in fear so that our conscious mind ultimately, ultimately reacts to that fear.
[00:46:22.963 --> 00:46:24.644]  And in fear of each other.
[00:46:24.644 --> 00:46:29.427]  You've got this authority figure on a big TV telling you to watch everyone.
[00:46:29.427 --> 00:46:32.109]  When we should be watching her, she works for the terrorists.
[00:46:33.154 --> 00:46:40.797]  Well, I am not enjoying this experience of putting my name on a pleading next to hers.
[00:46:40.797 --> 00:46:41.737]  That's for sure.
[00:46:41.737 --> 00:46:45.098]  And I have nothing personal to say about her.
[00:46:45.098 --> 00:46:53.301]  But when you're just a little bitty person and you take on the largest country in the world, it does make me feel a little apprehensive.
[00:46:53.301 --> 00:46:59.703]  And I know that there's a gentleman in Little Rock, Arkansas that's filed, I think, a somewhat similar action.
[00:47:00.483 --> 00:47:13.968]  But in this circumstance, being a lawyer, being at least educated on this particular issue, I felt it was my duty to file something to get this not only in the public eye, but to get it in the courts so that we hear from them.
[00:47:13.968 --> 00:47:16.789]  I want to know what the judge has to say.
[00:47:16.789 --> 00:47:19.710]  And it's going to be a very sophisticated approach.
[00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:22.371]  It's going to come down to expert witnesses.
[00:47:22.371 --> 00:47:29.594]  It's going to come down to how well I, you know, move myself through the procedure, which is always a matrix.
[00:47:30.194 --> 00:47:38.379]  No, you have a lot of courage, but I would surmise, and correct me if I'm wrong, at your gut level, because you love humanity and you're a decent person, you must sue
[00:47:57.310 --> 00:48:01.675]  And I'm telling you Alex, this is not just some esoteric issue that I'm bringing before the court.
[00:48:01.675 --> 00:48:03.758]  I had heard that they were moving in the direction of
[00:48:17.658 --> 00:48:17.998]  I think so.
[00:48:41.519 --> 00:48:51.248]  That in California they had changed the policy so that you had to choose between the body scanner and the full pat-down.
[00:48:51.248 --> 00:48:55.772]  I had always sort of convinced myself that at every level I could talk my way out of it.
[00:48:55.772 --> 00:48:56.293]  You know what I mean?
[00:48:56.573 --> 00:48:58.774]  Well, that's psychological warfare.
[00:48:58.774 --> 00:49:10.858]  They always give little outs, but then close them down slower and slower, because they know if they give an animal, this is animal psychology, an escape route, or a believed escape route, they won't turn and fight.
[00:49:10.858 --> 00:49:15.039]  And then they want to get you finally cornered, and then chew your guts out.
[00:49:15.039 --> 00:49:18.320]  And if you have gone through it personally,
[00:49:18.928 --> 00:49:21.428]  Then it's more than just an intellectual issue.
[00:49:21.428 --> 00:49:25.069]  It is a degradation of your human rights.
[00:49:25.069 --> 00:49:26.249]  Look, I had Ron Paul on.
[00:49:26.249 --> 00:49:27.650]  They actually grabbed his genitals.
[00:49:27.650 --> 00:49:30.990]  I mean, this is the new America.
[00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:37.571]  I walked up there, and I had not seen the sort of backscatter x-ray machines.
[00:49:37.571 --> 00:49:41.772]  I had seen the twirly ones that you get into, and those look a little ominous.
[00:49:41.772 --> 00:49:46.193]  But these backscatter ones, they just look like two big black carpeted boxes.
[00:49:46.813 --> 00:49:49.855]  And everyone was lined up and no one was opting out.
[00:49:49.855 --> 00:49:57.579]  So when I got up to the actual secured area, and of course, we're experienced travelers, even my small child.
[00:49:57.579 --> 00:50:04.463]  We know to put the sandals on, wear very light clothing, we load our things in the bucket very quickly.
[00:50:04.463 --> 00:50:06.064]  We're very experienced travelers.
[00:50:06.064 --> 00:50:08.986]  So when I walked up there, I asked the gentleman, I said, hey, what is that?
[00:50:08.986 --> 00:50:11.267]  And he said something that included the word scanner.
[00:50:11.947 --> 00:50:14.970]  And I said, well we're not going into that thing at all.
[00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:25.318]  So immediately you get led around into a secured area and you know they got a little spot for your feet to go and you're disconnected from your property.
[00:50:25.318 --> 00:50:26.719]  You're in their jurisdiction.
[00:50:27.219 --> 00:50:31.723]  You're on their land, and you have two choices at that point.
[00:50:31.723 --> 00:50:39.070]  Either stay where you're at, which for us was a thousand miles from home, or be subjected to this body scan.
[00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:42.773]  And now they're expanding to the Walmarts, the highways.
[00:50:42.773 --> 00:50:48.258]  This is the Nazification, the Sovietization of America.
[00:50:48.258 --> 00:50:48.699]  Stay there.
[00:50:48.699 --> 00:50:52.683]  I want to finish your story, but then I want to get into your lawsuit and where this is going.
[00:50:53.323 --> 00:50:56.388]  Ladies and gentlemen, you notice how fast things are moving now.
[00:50:56.388 --> 00:50:59.453]  They are attempting a total soft coup.
[00:51:01.311 --> 00:51:05.992]  We all know that Berkey Water Purification Systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:52:00.663 --> 00:52:05.627]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:52:05.627 --> 00:52:06.627]  What have we got?
[00:52:06.627 --> 00:52:09.069]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:52:09.069 --> 00:52:10.090]  A republic.
[00:52:10.090 --> 00:52:12.732]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:52:12.732 --> 00:52:14.994]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:52:14.994 --> 00:52:17.015]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:52:17.015 --> 00:52:18.696]  So they think they own our land?
[00:52:18.696 --> 00:52:20.017]  They think they own our water?
[00:52:20.017 --> 00:52:20.638]  Children?
[00:52:20.638 --> 00:52:21.759]  Our education?
[00:52:21.759 --> 00:52:22.579]  Our money?
[00:52:22.579 --> 00:52:26.222]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:52:26.582 --> 00:52:31.568]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:52:31.568 --> 00:52:32.589]  We have the facts.
[00:52:32.589 --> 00:52:33.750]  We have the Constitution.
[00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:34.652]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:52:34.652 --> 00:52:35.553]  We have common law.
[00:52:35.553 --> 00:52:38.076]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:38.076 --> 00:52:41.840]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:46.904]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:52:46.904 --> 00:52:48.406]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:52:48.406 --> 00:52:49.487]  Don't tread on me.
[00:52:49.487 --> 00:52:55.932]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:53:01.147 --> 00:53:03.389]  Attention shoppers, please stay in line.
[00:53:03.389 --> 00:53:06.311]  You must be scanned and searched before entering the mall area.
[00:53:06.311 --> 00:53:11.235]  Attention, you must disrobe and pass through the scanner at mall security before entering the building.
[00:53:11.235 --> 00:53:16.559]  Hey, most GCN listeners know that the future of Christmas shopping may quite well be that scary.
[00:53:16.559 --> 00:53:22.203]  And while we're not there yet, as shoppers we still face terrible traffic, crazy lines, and even crazier shoppers.
[00:53:22.403 --> 00:53:24.164]  But this year can be different.
[00:53:24.164 --> 00:53:35.349]  You can still opt out of the craziness and do your shopping off the grid by going to OffTheGridChristmas.com where you'll find our new Christmas video featuring an amazing assortment of truly hard-to-get gifts.
[00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:37.871]  Gifts you simply won't find in stores.
[00:53:37.871 --> 00:53:42.093]  These are gifts that can help anyone on your list become better prepared for the hard times ahead.
[00:53:42.093 --> 00:53:43.533]  And here's the best part.
[00:53:43.533 --> 00:53:46.395]  Prices have been slashed until December 15th.
[00:53:46.395 --> 00:53:48.036]  This year, opt out of the lines.
[00:53:48.036 --> 00:53:48.876]  You won't get fined
[00:53:49.056 --> 00:53:54.762]  You'll get great discounts on all kinds of Off The Grid gear by going to OffTheGridChristmas.com.
[00:53:54.762 --> 00:53:56.684]  Go to OffTheGridChristmas.com.
[00:53:56.684 --> 00:53:58.687]  That's OffTheGridChristmas.com.
[00:54:04.707 --> 00:54:14.714]  Well, a month ago in D.C., it even came out in mainstream news, the FBI went out and found mentally ill people, tried to create a plot with inert explosives to blow up subways.
[00:54:14.714 --> 00:54:19.637]  Then we heard about it, the plan to blow up the Christmas tree lighting in Oregon.
[00:54:19.637 --> 00:54:22.599]  Turned out that was a teenager completely set up.
[00:54:22.599 --> 00:54:24.481]  They go out and find lunatics.
[00:54:24.481 --> 00:54:25.922]  You or I could do this.
[00:54:25.922 --> 00:54:26.862]  Here's another story.
[00:54:26.862 --> 00:54:29.864]  Man arrested at recruitment center.
[00:54:31.038 --> 00:54:32.719]  We're good to go.
[00:55:00.609 --> 00:55:01.930]  Then they'd make bombs for him.
[00:55:01.930 --> 00:55:08.235]  But in the case of 93 World Trade Center, the FBI actually made a real bomb, ordered the informants to let it take place.
[00:55:08.235 --> 00:55:09.996]  So I guess we should thank Obama.
[00:55:09.996 --> 00:55:13.219]  At least they're just doing staged events that aren't real.
[00:55:13.219 --> 00:55:16.161]  Kind of like the Gulf of Tonkin saying the ship was attacked and it wasn't.
[00:55:16.161 --> 00:55:21.725]  But then that led to the war that killed millions on the Vietnamese side, 58,000 on the U.S.
[00:55:21.725 --> 00:55:22.726]  side.
[00:55:22.726 --> 00:55:26.449]  But talking to counselor, lawyer, Gary Fielder,
[00:55:27.050 --> 00:55:28.997]  Who's been fighting the naked body scanners.
[00:55:28.997 --> 00:55:31.587]  So, briefly, you went through this with your family.
[00:55:31.587 --> 00:55:32.430]  Describe what happened.
[00:55:33.237 --> 00:55:43.022]  So when they let us around the boxes with this backscatter x-ray device, you're in an area and you can see their instruments.
[00:55:43.022 --> 00:55:44.583]  You know what's going to happen next.
[00:55:44.583 --> 00:55:48.905]  So I turned around and I saw a blue glove on my nine-year-old daughter's shoulder.
[00:55:48.905 --> 00:55:49.946]  And I said, hey, what are you doing?
[00:55:49.946 --> 00:55:51.146]  Get your hands off my child!
[00:55:51.146 --> 00:55:52.627]  What is happening here?
[00:55:52.627 --> 00:55:55.709]  No, they're training you to take your children away from you.
[00:55:55.709 --> 00:55:57.550]  They're training you to go into prison camps.
[00:55:58.200 --> 00:55:59.320]  So you know what I did.
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:06.022]  I just started talking in a very monotone, low volume, and I didn't stop talking until I put my shoes on five minutes later.
[00:56:06.022 --> 00:56:08.542]  And throughout the process, I was just objecting.
[00:56:08.542 --> 00:56:09.762]  This is outrageous.
[00:56:09.762 --> 00:56:11.863]  I can't believe you're subjecting us to this.
[00:56:11.863 --> 00:56:13.263]  We're being treated like criminals.
[00:56:13.263 --> 00:56:14.783]  We've done nothing wrong.
[00:56:14.783 --> 00:56:18.604]  All of you have a subconscious need to do this, otherwise you wouldn't be doing it.
[00:56:18.604 --> 00:56:19.865]  And it went on and on.
[00:56:19.865 --> 00:56:24.445]  But I want you to envision, Alex, your children know how you feel.
[00:56:24.445 --> 00:56:26.406]  My children know how I feel.
[00:56:27.066 --> 00:56:38.262]  For them to stand there and watch their father actually have to submit or just stay in San Diego was one of the most devastating things I've ever seen in my life.
[00:56:38.262 --> 00:56:43.790]  Yeah, they teach you that the government is God and now all these top psychologists are on record saying
[00:56:44.130 --> 00:56:55.801]  These pat-downs of children are teaching them to be molested and now when we have TV on or I'm researching and my children hear about the pat-downs of children, we have to explain to them that's wrong.
[00:56:55.801 --> 00:57:00.346]  These are bad government people and don't let anybody else touch you like this.
[00:57:02.647 --> 00:57:04.928]  It's total psychological warfare, Gary.
[00:57:04.928 --> 00:57:07.170]  It's a total psych-op.
[00:57:07.170 --> 00:57:13.332]  Where are the paternal orders of police who often say they're proud to wear the uniform?
[00:57:13.332 --> 00:57:17.074]  Where are the firefighters who have to earn that uniform?
[00:57:17.074 --> 00:57:19.135]  These people are put into uniform.
[00:57:19.964 --> 00:57:22.845]  And so your children think that they're law enforcement officers.
[00:57:22.845 --> 00:57:25.507]  They're not law enforcement officers by statute.
[00:57:25.507 --> 00:57:28.008]  They're not trained in the Constitution.
[00:57:28.008 --> 00:57:30.589]  And so our children are standing there.
[00:57:30.589 --> 00:57:33.090]  One is their father objecting.
[00:57:33.090 --> 00:57:37.352]  The other is their government that they've been taught to be obedient to.
[00:57:37.352 --> 00:57:38.553]  They're put into a heavy
[00:57:40.063 --> 00:57:40.903]  Well, it's more than that.
[00:57:40.903 --> 00:57:42.864]  That's a great point, Gary.
[00:57:42.864 --> 00:57:55.047]  This is a new division of kind of minimum wage, quasi-police expanding on the streets of America, literally, and now they're giving grants to police to take blood without warrants.
[00:57:55.047 --> 00:57:57.928]  I mean, this country's going down, and they know exactly what they're doing.
[00:57:58.288 --> 00:58:01.069]  Well, I want to know where the American Cancer Society is.
[00:58:01.069 --> 00:58:10.254]  A lot of people have given them a lot of money, instead of the NFL putting out these silly little ads, sort of forcing us to go along with it.
[00:58:10.254 --> 00:58:13.095]  I want to see the NAACP step up.
[00:58:13.095 --> 00:58:16.897]  Black people's rights are being violated just like white people's rights.
[00:58:16.897 --> 00:58:18.918]  Where's Mothers Against Drunk Driving?
[00:58:18.918 --> 00:58:24.081]  Don't you see that the government is trying to... Well, I mean, the NAACP is there to make sure...
[00:58:24.721 --> 00:58:26.203]  51% of blacks are aborted.
[00:58:26.203 --> 00:58:28.945]  They're set up by the eugenicists.
[00:58:28.945 --> 00:58:31.967]  You want to kill the blacks, you've got to pose as their friend.
[00:58:31.967 --> 00:58:33.628]  And that came out with Margaret Sanger.
[00:58:33.628 --> 00:58:35.130]  They set all that up.
[00:58:35.130 --> 00:58:35.490]  Stay there.
[00:58:35.490 --> 00:58:36.971]  We're coming back in one minute.
[00:58:36.971 --> 00:58:42.155]  We'll be right back.

[00:59:55.927 --> 00:59:58.689]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.305 --> 01:00:10.151]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.151 --> 01:00:11.733]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.733 --> 01:00:13.275]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.275 --> 01:00:17.480]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:21.524]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.036 --> 01:00:25.257]  We're in to hour number two.
[01:00:25.257 --> 01:00:27.879]  Dr. Marcola is going to be joining us.
[01:00:27.879 --> 01:00:35.344]  Then I've got a bunch of financial news, incredible new TSA developments, key intel on the whole WikiLeaks situation.
[01:00:35.344 --> 01:00:42.329]  They're now confirming that they basically want to end the internet as we know it to stop the leaks that lead right back to the CIA.
[01:00:42.329 --> 01:00:44.851]  Assange himself clearly is the bag man.
[01:00:44.851 --> 01:00:47.313]  They're flushing down the commode here.
[01:00:47.313 --> 01:00:52.317]  But we're almost out of time, Gary Fielder, the lawyer who's been fighting successfully
[01:00:53.317 --> 01:00:54.198]  I think so.
[01:01:14.850 --> 01:01:22.898]  And so others can duplicate it, A, and B, what your lawsuit specifically is going to do and your injunction with the TSA.
[01:01:24.110 --> 01:01:43.361]  Well, I was successful at some level in getting the policy to change down in a local courthouse in Castle Rock, Colorado here, simply by just objecting and repeatedly objecting, threatening to file a lawsuit, appearing on your show, but never having to officially file a complaint.
[01:01:43.361 --> 01:01:46.243]  I now walk through that area, although they still have the
[01:01:46.523 --> 01:01:52.965]  The difference is those are actual sheriff's deputies who know the law, and you pointed out this violates child porn laws under 18.
[01:01:52.965 --> 01:01:59.828]  I mean, I mean, the problem is with TSA, they can find dumbed-down people that will be radiated and like grabbing kids' genitals.
[01:02:00.864 --> 01:02:19.534]  I was happy to note that when I went on a vacation in the summer to my hometown of Eagle River, Alaska, that the video that we had posted with regard to that event helped change the policy in Anchorage where the lawyers were in an uproar about a body scanner that was going into that courthouse.
[01:02:19.534 --> 01:02:25.857]  We've had some success with it, but I've seen this particular issue, as you have, coming down the pipe for a long time.
[01:02:25.857 --> 01:02:30.059]  So when it finally happened to me, I waited for approximately six weeks.
[01:02:30.499 --> 01:02:35.183]  The national outcry developed, and I did not think that I was going to have to file a lawsuit.
[01:02:35.183 --> 01:02:37.124]  I thought they were going to change.
[01:02:37.124 --> 01:02:41.027]  They not only did not change, but they buckled down even further.
[01:02:41.027 --> 01:02:45.470]  So I began to prepare my complaint, which you can find at InformationLiberation.com.
[01:02:46.451 --> 01:02:50.555]  And I noted something that I wanted to talk about for many years.
[01:02:50.555 --> 01:02:59.784]  If you read the Fourth Amendment, it says the right of the people to be secure in their person against unreasonable search and seizure shall not be violated.
[01:02:59.784 --> 01:03:05.389]  So the Fourth Amendment is not a right extended to all persons like the Fifth Amendment is.
[01:03:05.389 --> 01:03:06.711]  It's the right of the people.
[01:03:07.348 --> 01:03:10.730]  I entered the San Diego airport with my passport.
[01:03:10.730 --> 01:03:28.981]  I worked hard to get that passport, and I know you have one, Alex, but if you flip to the first page of that passport, it says, the Secretary of State of the United States of America hereby requests all whom it may concern to permit the citizen of the United States named herein to pass without delay or entrance.
[01:03:29.515 --> 01:03:32.158]  I have an official passport.
[01:03:32.158 --> 01:03:46.573]  When I show that passport to the TSA, they can swipe it, they can check me for work... But it is a lawful command, and their little flimsy made-up regulation does not trump the order.
[01:03:47.947 --> 01:03:52.250]  Well, we've been doing this sort of procedure now for approximately 40 years.
[01:03:52.250 --> 01:04:01.418]  I was 8 years old when I took my first flight, and I got to walk to the plane, and it wasn't there long after that these metal detectors were introduced to us.
[01:04:01.418 --> 01:04:05.121]  But they were specifically designed and engineered not to touch us.
[01:04:05.601 --> 01:04:06.963]  That's the whole point of the wand.
[01:04:06.963 --> 01:04:11.988]  That's the whole point of the freestanding metal detector so that you can walk through it.
[01:04:11.988 --> 01:04:17.895]  I want to make sure in the time that we have remaining to rebut this point that you don't have a right to fly.
[01:04:17.895 --> 01:04:20.098]  That's absolute BS, Alex.
[01:04:20.558 --> 01:04:24.022]  In this day and age, how can you express yourself?
[01:04:24.022 --> 01:04:25.484]  How can you be a musician?
[01:04:25.484 --> 01:04:26.625]  How can you be an artist?
[01:04:26.625 --> 01:04:29.489]  How can you be a radio talk show host, a lawyer, a doctor?
[01:04:29.489 --> 01:04:33.894]  How can you engage in commerce if you have to drive from Austin to New York?
[01:04:33.894 --> 01:04:35.957]  No, no, Bob Barr agrees with that.
[01:04:36.637 --> 01:04:40.058]  The Constitution is clear, and we've got right on our side.
[01:04:40.058 --> 01:04:42.859]  We've got to fight this police state takeover.
[01:04:42.859 --> 01:04:48.480]  We're going to have you back on in the near future, Gary, as your injunction and suit moves forward.
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:49.121]  God bless you.
[01:04:49.121 --> 01:04:51.621]  I appreciate you joining us.
[01:04:51.621 --> 01:04:53.722]  And we're going to be right back with Dr. Marcola.
[01:04:53.722 --> 01:04:54.142]  Stay with us.
[01:05:02.728 --> 01:05:04.469]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.

[01:05:10.191 --> 01:05:14.933]  I've told you for years that eFoodsDirect has the best storable food on the planet.

[01:06:00.376 --> 01:06:04.219]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[01:06:04.219 --> 01:06:08.483]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[01:06:08.483 --> 01:06:13.627]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[01:06:13.627 --> 01:06:19.131]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:06:19.131 --> 01:06:22.794]  Not worried about them moving south.
[01:06:22.794 --> 01:06:26.137]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:06:28.952 --> 01:06:34.435]  I'm looking for America.
[01:06:34.435 --> 01:06:36.076]  Wear American and be proud.
[01:06:36.076 --> 01:06:38.837]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:06:38.837 --> 01:06:47.261]  The land I left free and the home of the brave seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[01:06:54.870 --> 01:07:00.013]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:07:00.013 --> 01:07:04.575]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar powered generator.
[01:07:04.575 --> 01:07:08.917]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:08.917 --> 01:07:14.300]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:15.401]  It's true.
[01:07:15.401 --> 01:07:21.084]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:21.084 --> 01:07:24.687]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:24.687 --> 01:07:29.390]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:32.152]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:32.152 --> 01:07:35.494]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:35.834 --> 01:07:40.759]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:40.759 --> 01:07:45.823]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:45.823 --> 01:07:49.987]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:49.987 --> 01:07:51.789]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:51.789 --> 01:07:56.393]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:08.793]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.793 --> 01:08:11.775]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:15.165 --> 01:08:23.809]  Well, for the rest of this hour, and hopefully a little bit into the next hour, Dr. Joe Mercola, really a preeminent researcher, is our guest.
[01:08:23.809 --> 01:08:32.492]  And so much of what he covered 10, 15 years ago, the bisphenol A, the danger of cell phones, the GMO, it's now all mainstream.
[01:08:32.492 --> 01:08:39.535]  I mean, it was on Fox News last night, all these big studies about it brain damaging and hurting children, the cell phones.
[01:08:39.535 --> 01:08:42.997]  And they're letting you know now, so that they can say, well, we warned you.
[01:08:43.917 --> 01:08:50.199]  Kind of like for 50 years they told you tobacco was good for your lungs, then suddenly, well, it might not be good for you.
[01:08:50.199 --> 01:08:55.940]  And this is all part of a larger program of eugenics, but we'll get his take on that and go through a laundry list of issues.
[01:08:55.940 --> 01:09:00.321]  But this is so important because these are things we can do things about.
[01:09:00.321 --> 01:09:03.122]  Ten years ago, you couldn't find organic food in stores.
[01:09:03.122 --> 01:09:04.662]  Now people demand it.
[01:09:04.662 --> 01:09:07.463]  It's supplanting, you know, all the other GMO stuff.
[01:09:07.463 --> 01:09:10.464]  So the government's moving in, saying they don't want you to have to label
[01:09:11.224 --> 01:09:13.546]  GMO or GMO salmon.
[01:09:13.546 --> 01:09:16.288]  It's the same thing on bisphenol A being pulled out all over the place.
[01:09:16.288 --> 01:09:21.332]  We're going to talk about it with Dr. Marcola in just a minute.
[01:09:21.332 --> 01:09:25.115]  Real fast, Charlotte Isserby, former head of policy at the Department of Education,
[01:09:27.523 --> 01:09:28.804]  She is pretty much retired.
[01:09:28.804 --> 01:09:40.954]  She wrote this big phone book-sized book, The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America, that has all the government documents about the plan that goes back almost 100 years to slowly dumb down our society, to break up the family.
[01:09:40.954 --> 01:09:42.515]  You see how successful it is.
[01:09:42.515 --> 01:09:44.476]  She has the smoking guns.
[01:09:44.476 --> 01:09:49.040]  We got like 700 of these and bought out everything she had and they sold out.
[01:09:50.348 --> 01:09:58.474]  And she said, well, I was going to keep a couple hundred of these to give to friends and family, but she called me and said, I'm getting so many calls asking for them since you sold out.
[01:09:58.474 --> 01:09:59.315]  I don't want to deal with it.
[01:09:59.315 --> 01:10:00.155]  I'm selling them to you.
[01:10:00.155 --> 01:10:01.956]  So those are now being shipped to us.
[01:10:01.956 --> 01:10:04.658]  We've got a little under 200 left.
[01:10:04.658 --> 01:10:07.660]  If you want to order them, they're at Infowars.com right now.
[01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:09.922]  They are now officially out of print.
[01:10:09.922 --> 01:10:12.264]  By the way, these things on Amazon are selling for $200 to $900 a piece.
[01:10:14.125 --> 01:10:14.785]  I don't know why.
[01:10:14.785 --> 01:10:18.347]  We were selling them for $40 and people were flipping out.
[01:10:18.347 --> 01:10:23.389]  So the point is, it's got to be one of the modest out of print books out there.
[01:10:23.389 --> 01:10:27.311]  And I just wanted to get her back on the show and called her and she said, hey, I'm done.
[01:10:27.311 --> 01:10:29.212]  So if you want to buy them, go ahead.
[01:10:29.212 --> 01:10:29.933]  How many do you want?
[01:10:29.933 --> 01:10:31.973]  I said, well, give them all to me.
[01:10:31.973 --> 01:10:33.294]  I'll sell them over the next year.
[01:10:33.294 --> 01:10:35.075]  Well, it took less than 24 hours.
[01:10:35.075 --> 01:10:39.177]  So she scrounged up a little under $200 and some more hardcovers, but we're going to
[01:10:40.236 --> 01:10:43.239]  Hold off until next week with those because they're signed.
[01:10:43.239 --> 01:10:53.770]  But the soft covers right now, Deliberate Dumbing Down of America, available at infowars.com or by calling 888-253-3139 if you want to get those.
[01:10:53.770 --> 01:10:55.712]  Also, I want to tell you about one of our great sponsors.
[01:10:55.712 --> 01:11:00.297]  It's efoodsdirect.com, the super high quality, non-GMO, non-hybrid,
[01:11:00.797 --> 01:11:01.898]  Storable Foods Company.
[01:11:01.898 --> 01:11:06.822]  It lasts more than 10 years in climate control, 10 years in non-climate control like my garage.
[01:11:06.822 --> 01:11:21.114]  They've got a bunch of special diets, all sorts of gourmet, freeze-dried, and they got it all, and they're patriots, and they are the name of Storable Foods, and their food is made fresh every week, not 10-year-old junk like a lot of other companies.
[01:11:21.915 --> 01:11:31.221]  So, this is where I get my storable food, efoodsdirect.com, or 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com.
[01:11:31.221 --> 01:11:34.824]  You'll never stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:11:34.824 --> 01:11:42.509]  It is so important for people to get into the position of getting self-sufficient.
[01:11:42.509 --> 01:11:47.713]  And along that same line, finally, before we go to Dr. Marcola, I'm proud to welcome this wonderful sponsor,
[01:11:48.823 --> 01:11:52.844]  A well-known company in the preparedness field for, well now, right at 10 years.
[01:11:52.844 --> 01:11:57.225]  You can check them out at www.prepared.pro.
[01:11:57.225 --> 01:12:03.546]  That's P-E-P-R-E-P-A-R-E-D.pro, prepared.pro.
[01:12:03.546 --> 01:12:08.267]  You can also get to their store at theprisonplanet.com, where we have a banner on the right-hand side of the page.
[01:12:08.267 --> 01:12:10.807]  These folks have been in the readiness business for 10 years.
[01:12:10.807 --> 01:12:14.148]  They're fond of saying they're in the business of steel-plated peace of mind.
[01:12:14.148 --> 01:12:15.768]  They got a lot of amazing stuff on the site.
[01:12:16.368 --> 01:12:18.429]  I have even bought some things off their site.
[01:12:18.429 --> 01:12:21.470]  They sell everything you need to be more ready for what's coming down the pike.
[01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:22.551]  Well, it's already here.
[01:12:22.551 --> 01:12:26.513]  Survival gear, supplies, even steel-plated underground shelters and safe rooms.
[01:12:26.513 --> 01:12:27.473]  Tell them I sent you.
[01:12:27.473 --> 01:12:32.336]  Again, it's prepared.pro for all your professional crisis preparedness assistance.
[01:12:32.336 --> 01:12:39.799]  I mean, the government and private corporations are like an armed madhouse building up their weapons, their hardened bunkers against us.
[01:12:39.799 --> 01:12:41.100]  We need to get prepared.
[01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:41.360]  Okay.
[01:12:43.011 --> 01:12:53.099]  I am really excited about having our guest on, and of course he's Dr. Joseph Marcola, and he's done so many amazing things.
[01:12:53.099 --> 01:12:59.364]  I don't even know, here with his bio, where to start, but he reaches millions of people every week.
[01:13:00.064 --> 01:13:13.360]  With his website and his organizations, and so I know he didn't like to toot his own horn, but in a couple minutes dr. Marcola before we launch into all this key information What's most important for folks to know about you may not know who you are?
[01:13:14.833 --> 01:13:21.280]  Well, I'm the founder of Mercola.com, which now currently is the third most visited health site in the world.
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:27.968]  We're right behind the National Institutes of Health and WebMD, and we just passed Mayo Clinic, so we're number three in the world.
[01:13:27.968 --> 01:13:35.276]  And it gives us a platform to really educate people about the fraud and deception that's occurring from the drug industry and the food industry.
[01:13:36.813 --> 01:13:42.619]  And you have made significant milestones in your mission to bring people practical solutions to their health problems.
[01:13:42.619 --> 01:13:54.209]  New York Times bestselling author, Dr. Mercola, was also involved in the 2009 Ultimate Wellness Game Changer by the Huffington Post, and has been featured in Time Magazine, LA Times, CNN, Fox News, you name it.
[01:13:54.209 --> 01:13:55.931]  We're honored to have you with us.
[01:13:55.931 --> 01:13:59.194]  Again, Mercola, M-E-R-C-O-L-A dot com.
[01:13:59.854 --> 01:14:08.556]  And the reason you're the most respected of all the alternative health researchers, in my opinion, is because you just go off the real research, and there's so much to cover.
[01:14:08.556 --> 01:14:20.459]  But what can you say about, I mean, my view, I don't know if it's your view, but certainly from what I see on the ground, there is a collapse of confidence in the system.
[01:14:20.459 --> 01:14:27.681]  Everything we talked about last year, about the H1N1 lowering your immunity, being dangerous, that's now mainstream news, British Medical Journal.
[01:14:28.681 --> 01:14:41.580]  I mean, there is a collapse of confidence in this corrupt system, and the establishment is responding in a lot of strange ways, but it does look like the dam has broken.
[01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:42.402]  What's your view on that?
[01:14:43.402 --> 01:14:45.063]  I think we're making progress.
[01:14:45.063 --> 01:14:55.008]  There still is a large contingency of the public who is still fooled and deceived by the very effective marketing tactics that these industries employ.
[01:14:55.008 --> 01:15:00.871]  I mean, they literally generate many tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars in profit, and they're able to really
[01:15:01.651 --> 01:15:23.020]  Higher the most sophisticated and clever marketers on the planet so they did a really sophisticated system It's really difficult to break out of that mold But once you yourself have an injury or if the system fails you then you're really seeking more more sound logical rational alternatives that really don't rely on expensive and toxic approaches that could could literally kill you and
[01:15:24.708 --> 01:15:34.141]  And I see the statistics and the numbers of 300,000 dying from drug interactions, hundreds of thousands from infections.
[01:15:34.141 --> 01:15:41.911]  I mean, boy, I tell you, this mainline healthcare is one of the biggest killers out there, rivaling even automobile accidents.
[01:15:42.632 --> 01:15:45.935]  On your radar screen, what do you see as the biggest threats out there?
[01:15:45.935 --> 01:15:51.879]  Is it sodium fluoride in the water, bisphenol A, GMO, cell phone radiation?
[01:15:51.879 --> 01:15:53.420]  I mean, you cover it all.
[01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:59.145]  The stuff, as I said earlier, you were covering 10 years ago is now just all over the mainstream news.
[01:16:00.626 --> 01:16:01.567]  Well, it's a good question.
[01:16:01.567 --> 01:16:03.428]  I'm not sure if there's anyone that sticks out.
[01:16:03.428 --> 01:16:05.669]  It's really a combination of them.
[01:16:05.669 --> 01:16:14.375]  But I think probably it's just a concept and a belief that the traditional model is the approach for health care challenges.
[01:16:14.375 --> 01:16:16.797]  That is, relying on a drug.
[01:16:16.797 --> 01:16:19.779]  And we're bombarded on that, of course, from the media.
[01:16:19.779 --> 01:16:26.183]  They spend over $16 billion a year to do direct-to-consumer advertising on TV.
[01:16:26.183 --> 01:16:30.106]  And, you know, the United States is only one of two countries in the world that allows that, where it's even legal.
[01:16:30.806 --> 01:16:42.689]  So, they've really manipulated the public, the belief system that this is the approach, because these drugs are almost universally going to cause some type of side effect, if not death.
[01:16:42.689 --> 01:16:43.529]  I mean, it's routine.
[01:16:43.529 --> 01:16:46.370]  I mean, Avandia's just killed 80,000 people.
[01:16:46.370 --> 01:16:48.170]  Before that, Vioxx killed 60,000.
[01:16:48.170 --> 01:16:51.751]  And these are the ones that we know that are really giving the news.
[01:16:53.095 --> 01:16:57.018]  Dozens of others that are less toxic.
[01:16:57.018 --> 01:17:10.727]  It's choosing that system, that approach, and you're ignoring the basic practical strategies that one can use, which of course doesn't generate profit and revenue for these large industries.
[01:17:10.727 --> 01:17:14.650]  I think it's a belief in that model that's the most dangerous.
[01:17:14.650 --> 01:17:15.791]  The most dangerous threat.
[01:17:16.852 --> 01:17:22.396]  Well, I agree with you, and when I watch these drug ads, it's absurdist.
[01:17:22.396 --> 01:17:25.918]  It's like they're openly admitting this drug is probably going to kill you.
[01:17:25.918 --> 01:17:27.259]  Oh, you're having trouble sleeping?
[01:17:27.259 --> 01:17:30.641]  Or you're having trouble, you know, needing to urinate a lot?
[01:17:30.641 --> 01:17:37.865]  And they'll tell you ten seconds how great it is, but then they say it may not be right for you, causes heart attack, sudden death, brain damage.
[01:17:37.865 --> 01:17:38.986]  I mean, it's bizarre.
[01:17:40.667 --> 01:17:43.689]  And then ask your doctor about this drug.
[01:17:43.689 --> 01:17:49.492]  I mean, it's... Sometimes I'm pinching myself, wondering if I'm having a bad dream.
[01:17:49.492 --> 01:17:51.554]  It almost seems that way to me.
[01:17:51.554 --> 01:17:52.394]  It really is.
[01:17:52.394 --> 01:17:55.556]  If you go to any other country in the world, you're not going to see that in the media except for Australia.
[01:17:55.556 --> 01:18:00.159]  There's only two countries in the world that allow that.
[01:18:00.159 --> 01:18:08.424]  Let's start... You know, it really... You look at things, and it's been on for 15 years, but prior to 1995, those ads did not exist in the media.
[01:18:08.424 --> 01:18:08.944]  It was illegal.
[01:18:13.884 --> 01:18:20.712]  Meanwhile, they're always waging war against alternative medicine or even vitamins and minerals.
[01:18:20.712 --> 01:18:25.198]  Now they're demonizing, you know, vitamin D. It just gets crazier and crazier.
[01:18:26.010 --> 01:18:45.497]  Well, it wasn't so much as demonizing, but the Institute of Medicine came out with a report last week which really essentially ignored the stacks of new studies and research that promote, that establish vitamin D as a very useful approach in over 2,000 diseases!
[01:18:45.497 --> 01:18:53.819]  And they only focused on bone health, which we've known about for about 100 years, and they ignored all the rest of the research, and virtually no vitamin D experts were on the panel.
[01:18:53.819 --> 01:18:55.000]  It was really a travesty.
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:15.677]  Yeah, it's hard to nail a specific conspiracy, but there's some actually lawsuits against this recommendation because it's really deceiving the public and not allowing them to fully utilize this incredible resource, which is about one of the least expensive vitamins you can possibly purchase, and one that has probably the most significant impact on your health.
[01:19:15.677 --> 01:19:19.541]  Sure, but I mean, by demonized, I was thinking of Dr. Dina Dell, who
[01:19:21.202 --> 01:19:37.525]  I mean I listened to him and just almost everything he says is patently false and he was just flipping out and saying that you know it's bad to take most vitamins and that we don't need them but but then I look at all the studies about vitamin and mineral deficiency and what a big problem it is when we come back
[01:19:38.166 --> 01:19:42.708]  I want to discuss a lot of the articles that are at Mercola.com.
[01:19:42.708 --> 01:19:45.590]  Pregnant women should minimize exposure to cell phones.
[01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:46.771]  I want to look at that.
[01:19:46.771 --> 01:19:54.675]  I want to look at all these reports of different chemicals that are in plastics that we are eating our foods out of and what that's causing.
[01:19:54.675 --> 01:19:59.117]  Ways that, from your research, are the best ways to detox all the thyroid problems.
[01:19:59.117 --> 01:20:00.598]  We'll talk about it with Dr. Mercola.
[01:20:01.258 --> 01:20:04.359]  Calling all manufacturers from across the United States.
[01:20:04.359 --> 01:20:10.660]  Are you eager to have people buy your products right here at home instead of having them buy competing products made on the other side of the world?
[01:20:10.660 --> 01:20:15.060]  Do you want to build your business while helping boost our nation's economy at the same time?

[01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:04.957]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:21:04.957 --> 01:21:09.438]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:21:09.438 --> 01:21:15.599]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:21:15.599 --> 01:21:18.040]  When I first joined, I was being sued.

[01:24:07.791 --> 01:24:13.997]  Coming up in about 10-15 minutes, I'm going to open the phones up specifically for health questions that you have for him.
[01:24:13.997 --> 01:24:16.079]  I have a few of my own questions.
[01:24:16.599 --> 01:24:24.602]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:24:24.602 --> 01:24:25.982]  800-259-9231.
[01:24:25.982 --> 01:24:39.006]  Doc, going through the articles that I see you posting and that your great researchers are putting together that link to all the mainline medical studies that are out there, it's not just bisphenol A we've got to worry about.
[01:24:39.006 --> 01:24:43.128]  You've been reporting on the other chemicals that are in the liners of the
[01:24:45.029 --> 01:24:49.112]  Wrappers around hamburgers and other things that are causing serious problems.
[01:24:49.112 --> 01:24:54.896]  Can you go over what Bisphenol A and these other chemicals are and what the studies show they're doing?
[01:24:54.896 --> 01:25:10.327]  Well, the article you're referring to we posted last week, a study that came out that showed that these wrappers, which are usually put in place to prevent the grease and oils in the fast food from leaking out, as they would if you used regular paper, they have these sticky coatings.
[01:25:10.327 --> 01:25:14.370]  And you see some of it, too, also on the microwavable popcorn.
[01:25:15.026 --> 01:25:29.216]  So, the way they're able to do that is really similar to how they achieve a non-stick surface, which is they put a fluorinated chemical compound, and this fluorine compound actually dissociates and it migrates into the food.
[01:25:29.216 --> 01:25:32.338]  So, you're actually eating these compounds when you do that.
[01:25:32.338 --> 01:25:34.720]  That's definitely not going to be... Fluorine?
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:36.701]  That sounds like fluoride.
[01:25:36.701 --> 01:25:37.041]  Yes.
[01:25:37.041 --> 01:25:38.222]  Well, it's a fluoride compound.
[01:25:38.222 --> 01:25:38.963]  There's no question.
[01:25:38.963 --> 01:25:41.745]  Well, they just love to give us fluoride, I guess because they love us.
[01:25:42.793 --> 01:25:44.054]  Well, it's a pretty useful chemical.
[01:25:44.054 --> 01:25:50.120]  It's a really interesting innovation to have a material that you can fry food with and not stick.
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:53.182]  But it does it at quite a price.
[01:25:53.182 --> 01:26:03.551]  Typically, when I'm lecturing, I tell people if they have any non-stick finishes to either find a relative or a neighbor they don't like and give it to them because the stuff is toxic in fact.
[01:26:03.551 --> 01:26:06.134]  But actually, it's not that toxic as long as you don't eat it.
[01:26:06.634 --> 01:26:13.420]  But the moment you heat it, you start to volatilize this fluoride, and it goes into a gas, and it can cause health problems.
[01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:18.624]  And it's so much so that if you're in a closed environment, you can actually kill cat birds.
[01:26:18.624 --> 01:26:20.445]  I mean, this stuff is really toxic.
[01:26:20.445 --> 01:26:23.047]  Oh, I'm sure it's an accident they're doing this.
[01:26:23.047 --> 01:26:29.893]  Also, the report on the bisphenol A is in most, or 40%, and they said, oh, 60% of the printer ink.
[01:26:29.893 --> 01:26:32.435]  So I guess I'm touching it right here, right now.
[01:26:32.435 --> 01:26:33.736]  I mean, this stuff is just everywhere.
[01:26:34.397 --> 01:26:41.601]  Well, it's sort of stealth too, and when you go to the grocery store and you get these receipts, it's on those receipts.
[01:26:41.601 --> 01:26:46.223]  So, you know, you want to really minimize your contact with those.
[01:26:46.223 --> 01:26:50.566]  Now the good news is, what, four states have passed laws that start restricting this, at least for children.
[01:26:50.566 --> 01:26:55.068]  They're pointing out that it's in the baby bottles, as again, you did a decade ago, plus.
[01:26:55.068 --> 01:27:00.511]  So we're starting to move in a good direction, but now we're finding out that this stuff is just everywhere.
[01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:02.220]  It's invasive.
[01:27:02.220 --> 01:27:03.241]  There's no question it is.
[01:27:03.241 --> 01:27:10.969]  And aside from the bisphenol A, you have the phthalates, which is a chemical that's added in the manufacture of plastic to make it pliable.
[01:27:10.969 --> 01:27:14.613]  So any plastic that's flexible will have these phthalates in there.
[01:27:14.613 --> 01:27:18.136]  That's another chemical that's loaded with complications.
[01:27:18.136 --> 01:27:19.538]  That also should be banned.
[01:27:20.418 --> 01:27:43.147]  Well, from my research, correct me if I'm wrong, a large percentage of petrochemical waste, in some cases up to 30% of crude oil, they have to get rid of, and so they just created industries for the distillates, what was left, and that's where most of this stuff comes from, it's petrochemical leavings, and so they just put it into our food chain.
[01:27:45.052 --> 01:27:46.856]  And they charge a pretty price for it, too.
[01:27:46.856 --> 01:27:53.891]  Just very similar to what they've done with fluoride waste products, which is a common waste material when they manufacture aluminum.
[01:27:54.602 --> 01:28:01.865]  Well, I'm not the leading alternative health research director out there like you are, but I do talk to the public.
[01:28:01.865 --> 01:28:03.686]  I do see things in mainstream media.
[01:28:03.686 --> 01:28:06.407]  I hear women talking on radio.
[01:28:06.407 --> 01:28:09.168]  I hear women talking in grocery stores.
[01:28:09.168 --> 01:28:11.629]  Women's magazines, I read them.
[01:28:11.629 --> 01:28:15.631]  It's got to be a third or more of the women, young women, are having thyroid problems.
[01:28:15.631 --> 01:28:18.593]  Their hair is falling out.
[01:28:18.593 --> 01:28:22.874]  Is that a cocktail of chemicals with this epidemic of women's hair falling out?
[01:28:24.355 --> 01:28:30.539]  There's two primary ones that are culprits, and they tend to be these halogens.
[01:28:30.539 --> 01:28:41.586]  It's important to understand that iodine is an important mineral that we need for thyroid function, but it's easily displaced by these other halogen chemicals or elements such as fluoride and also bromine.
[01:28:41.586 --> 01:28:49.911]  So fluoride is becoming pervasive and clearly the most common source of the water supply, but fluoridated toothpaste is also another issue.
[01:28:49.911 --> 01:28:52.553]  So when you're consuming that and you're consuming most
[01:28:52.873 --> 01:28:54.654]  It's bleached flowers.
[01:28:54.654 --> 01:28:56.495]  It's bleached with bromine.
[01:28:56.495 --> 01:28:59.216]  So almost all the flower out there is brominated.
[01:28:59.216 --> 01:29:04.418]  So these bromine add fluoride ions that's placed to iodine for the thyroid.
[01:29:04.418 --> 01:29:09.321]  And as a result, you can't form thyroid hormone because that's what's part of the thyroid hormone.
[01:29:09.321 --> 01:29:10.341]  It's iodine.
[01:29:10.341 --> 01:29:12.562]  So that's the mechanism.
[01:29:12.562 --> 01:29:14.963]  Soy is also another pervasive one.
[01:29:14.963 --> 01:29:18.765]  There's a hormone in there called isoflavone.
[01:29:20.025 --> 01:29:27.668]  Unbelievable.
[01:29:27.668 --> 01:29:28.689]  Stay there Dr. Long.
[01:29:28.689 --> 01:29:29.469]  Segment coming up.
[01:29:29.469 --> 01:29:31.570]  I want to continue going through this.
[01:29:31.570 --> 01:29:37.612]  So what do women and men and others who are losing all their hair, they're becoming obese, even though they're not eating a lot,
[01:29:38.092 --> 01:29:41.314]  Well, I mean, how do you reverse this?
[01:29:41.314 --> 01:29:42.615]  And is there a way to clean it out?
[01:29:42.615 --> 01:29:44.337]  Well, we'll be right back, folks.
[01:29:44.337 --> 01:29:51.142]  Fluoride, fluoride everywhere, and no clean food or water for us to drink.
[01:29:51.142 --> 01:29:52.523]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.523 --> 01:29:55.065]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.065 --> 01:29:57.727]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.598 --> 01:30:17.071]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:30:17.071 --> 01:30:20.754]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:21.778 --> 01:30:34.530]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:30:34.530 --> 01:30:41.797]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:30:42.478 --> 01:30:52.863]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:30:52.863 --> 01:30:56.785]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:30:56.785 --> 01:30:59.887]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[01:31:00.595 --> 01:31:04.798]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:31:04.798 --> 01:31:11.202]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:31:11.202 --> 01:31:18.587]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:31:18.587 --> 01:31:23.130]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:31:32.115 --> 01:31:36.377]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:31:36.377 --> 01:31:42.541]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:31:43.141 --> 01:31:47.043]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:31:47.043 --> 01:31:53.126]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[01:31:53.126 --> 01:31:53.406]  Thank you.
[01:31:53.406 --> 01:31:58.608]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:32:04.472 --> 01:32:05.733]  Tyranny is here.
[01:32:05.733 --> 01:32:09.677]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:32:09.677 --> 01:32:11.899]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:11.899 --> 01:32:17.785]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:32:17.785 --> 01:32:24.032]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:24.432 --> 01:32:30.413]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:32:30.413 --> 01:32:34.574]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:32:34.574 --> 01:32:38.875]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:32:38.875 --> 01:32:44.836]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:32:44.836 --> 01:32:48.376]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:32:48.376 --> 01:32:50.357]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:32:50.357 --> 01:32:50.777]  It's here.

[01:33:00.369 --> 01:33:05.456]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:33:11.308 --> 01:33:16.991]  So, Dr. Mercola, you get the same intel that I'm receiving.
[01:33:16.991 --> 01:33:20.313]  I mean, they admit in the media that thyroid dysfunction is off the charts.
[01:33:20.313 --> 01:33:26.717]  Perhaps you can talk about those numbers, but just women everywhere, talk show hosts, you name it, young women.
[01:33:26.717 --> 01:33:29.658]  I hear them talking about it, and I see women all over the place.
[01:33:29.658 --> 01:33:31.760]  You can see their hair falling out.
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:37.803]  I mean, how much more obvious does this poisoned environment have to get?
[01:33:37.803 --> 01:33:39.364]  Please continue breaking that down.
[01:33:40.455 --> 01:33:43.857]  Well, the bulk of the people that experience it are women.
[01:33:43.857 --> 01:33:49.441]  My guess is it's certainly the majority of women, but perhaps 75-80% of women have some challenge with it.
[01:33:49.441 --> 01:33:57.366]  If your listeners are interested in finding out if they have a problem, you can certainly go online to our website or Google it and find out what the symptoms are.
[01:33:57.366 --> 01:33:58.687]  But there's a blood test you can take.
[01:33:58.687 --> 01:34:02.129]  It's called TSH, which is short for thyroid stimulant hormone.
[01:34:02.569 --> 01:34:09.853]  Of course, the normal conventional lab tests, normal ranges are off, but if your lumbar comes back below 1.5, then it's okay.
[01:34:09.853 --> 01:34:22.178]  If it's above 1.5, it'll be most likely a problem, but you'll be told that you're okay if it's below 5, so there's this range where almost all the conventional doctors are misunderstanding and misinterpreting the results.
[01:34:22.178 --> 01:34:24.920]  So, it's far more common than traditional
[01:34:26.297 --> 01:34:27.137]  So what do you do?
[01:34:27.137 --> 01:34:31.859]  Get off these things that have the fluorines and fluorides in it?
[01:34:31.859 --> 01:34:33.440]  Stop using the non-stick?
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:36.341]  Stop drinking out of the Bisphenol A?
[01:34:36.341 --> 01:34:37.721]  Stop drinking the fluorinated water?
[01:34:37.721 --> 01:34:38.762]  Stop bathing in it?
[01:34:38.762 --> 01:34:41.283]  I mean, are there ways to heal?
[01:34:41.283 --> 01:34:44.224]  No fluoride toothpaste, and you know, the flour.
[01:34:44.224 --> 01:34:45.784]  You can't have brominated flour.
[01:34:45.784 --> 01:34:49.866]  That's definitely a... So, no white flour, no bleached flour?
[01:34:50.836 --> 01:34:51.476]  Right.
[01:34:51.476 --> 01:34:52.957]  It'll stay brominated on it.
[01:34:52.957 --> 01:34:58.599]  So though you have to stop the assault to your body, that's one, but then the detoxification can be somewhat of a challenge.
[01:34:58.599 --> 01:35:08.082]  And you know, the key thing is if you have serious thyroid issues, most likely you're placed on a synthetic version of thyroid hormone, which is called most commonly dendrite.
[01:35:09.162 --> 01:35:10.663]  Is that the one that's from cows?
[01:35:10.663 --> 01:35:10.843]  Yeah.
[01:35:32.458 --> 01:35:32.838]  I don't know.
[01:35:32.838 --> 01:35:38.363]  I just did some research and saw them promoting and selling desiccated cow thyroid.
[01:35:38.363 --> 01:35:42.407]  I think it's a better one, but it's somewhat hard to find.
[01:35:42.407 --> 01:35:43.868]  The most common thyroid is pig.
[01:35:45.285 --> 01:35:50.891]  And I guess you go to a doctor or clinic and then they test your blood?
[01:35:50.891 --> 01:35:52.052]  Those are prescriptions.
[01:35:52.052 --> 01:35:56.116]  Most of the time you're going to get the test through a licensed healthcare professional.
[01:35:56.116 --> 01:35:59.999]  And those specific supplements do have a specific prescription, at least in the United States.
[01:35:59.999 --> 01:36:04.684]  Of course, you can be creative and go online and purchase these things overseas without a prescription.
[01:36:05.114 --> 01:36:10.178]  And then the women start to see their hair come back from the research I've looked at.
[01:36:10.178 --> 01:36:18.063]  But you notice when you search these terms, you mainly find people that want to do hair restoration or they want to sell you medoxidil.
[01:36:18.063 --> 01:36:21.486]  They don't want to tell you, you know, it's just like mainline medical science.
[01:36:21.486 --> 01:36:29.391]  They want to treat the illness instead of, or treat the symptoms, instead of actually treating the underlying cause, correct?
[01:36:29.391 --> 01:36:31.393]  That tends to be the common pattern, yes.
[01:36:32.128 --> 01:36:33.550]  Boy, that is cold-blooded.
[01:36:33.550 --> 01:36:38.116]  So for all you women out there wondering why your hair is falling out at age 30, now you know.
[01:36:38.116 --> 01:36:43.043]  Are there any other causal things that people can knock out?
[01:36:43.043 --> 01:36:47.009]  And from your research, I mean, how much of the women's hair comes back?
[01:36:48.683 --> 01:36:50.584]  Well, it's variable.
[01:36:50.584 --> 01:36:51.825]  A good percentage of them will.
[01:36:51.825 --> 01:37:06.176]  And one of the other components that really is an important element, and really what I believe is the primary cause of obesity in this country, and it's clear and obvious that if you walk down any urban city, you'll find that two or three people are overweight.
[01:37:06.176 --> 01:37:08.998]  I mean, it's a really massive epidemic that we're going in.
[01:37:08.998 --> 01:37:14.242]  And it's relatively recent, and I believe it's related to the manufacture of
[01:37:14.662 --> 01:37:15.202]  I think so.
[01:37:27.938 --> 01:37:42.925]  Now, let's talk about high fructose, because now they're running ads where the smart woman, because they know women buy about 80% of the products, it's always a woman telling a man off or telling another woman off that, oh, it's a conspiracy theory that high fructose is bad.
[01:37:42.925 --> 01:37:50.508]  Corn syrup is good for you, but then there's all these mainline studies with the diabetes and what it does to our metabolic systems.
[01:37:50.508 --> 01:37:55.971]  Dr. Marcola, break down what the high fructose is doing, why it's different from sugar.
[01:37:57.168 --> 01:38:04.272]  Well, sugar or sucrose, which you can get from canes or beets, it used to be the common way that we got sugar in this country, is really similar.
[01:38:04.272 --> 01:38:12.017]  There's not a lot of difference between the two, because simple sugar is 50% fructose and 50% glucose or dextrose.
[01:38:12.017 --> 01:38:14.638]  So, from that perspective, it's a problem.
[01:38:14.638 --> 01:38:17.920]  And if you get high fructose corn syrup, it's about the same ratio.
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:19.041]  There are two differences.
[01:38:19.041 --> 01:38:24.564]  One is in high fructose corn syrup, it's a simple sugar and it's dissociated, it's not bonded together with the glucose.
[01:38:25.024 --> 01:38:32.310]  So it's absorbed a little more quickly, but the primary reason why it's such a problem is it's so darn cheap!
[01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:38.235]  And people, food manufacturers are putting it into everything, so the numbers are going through the roof of what people are consuming.
[01:38:38.235 --> 01:38:44.620]  You know, at 1900, Alex, the average person only consumed about 15 grams of fructose, and that was mostly in the forms of fruits.
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:46.601]  Healthy fruit!
[01:38:46.601 --> 01:38:57.124]  But now, about 25% of the population is consuming more than 135 grams a day, well more than 10 times what the average person was consuming a mere 100 years ago.
[01:38:57.124 --> 01:39:00.125]  So it has significant metabolic problems.
[01:39:00.125 --> 01:39:10.649]  So if you have a problem, a challenge with your diet, or really any health problem, cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, one of the most important things you can do is get off the fructose.
[01:39:10.649 --> 01:39:13.190]  This is really a shock, and I'm sure many of your listeners realize it, but the most
[01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:14.031]  I don't know.
[01:39:32.431 --> 01:39:39.676]  Oh, wow, Dr. Joseph Mercola is our guest and we're going to tell you more about his website as we talk to him.
[01:39:39.676 --> 01:39:41.337]  I want to go to some calls here soon.
[01:39:41.337 --> 01:39:43.138]  It's at Mercola.com.
[01:39:43.138 --> 01:39:45.040]  Take control of your health.
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:47.882]  Just amazing research and information.
[01:39:47.882 --> 01:39:51.464]  More and more mainline studies are having to admit in the U.S.
[01:39:51.464 --> 01:40:01.691]  and Europe, as you know, that frequency pollution is a big problem and that the studies are showing with pregnant women, you name it, it's really
[01:40:02.252 --> 01:40:03.414]  Thank you.
[01:40:12.233 --> 01:40:17.396]  Well, these are definitely a challenge, because they're a great explosion.
[01:40:17.396 --> 01:40:20.838]  Most people don't realize that cell phones are a relatively recent innovation.
[01:40:20.838 --> 01:40:24.940]  You know, before 25 years ago, they didn't exist anywhere in the world.
[01:40:24.940 --> 01:40:31.784]  And, you know, I think it was in the mid-90s or late-90s, we had a billion telephones, and then we're up to four billion now.
[01:40:31.784 --> 01:40:35.706]  So this is a relatively recent exposure to this radiation.
[01:40:35.706 --> 01:40:40.209]  And just like smoking, I think that's really the most powerful, simple analogy,
[01:40:40.789 --> 01:40:45.572]  These exposures don't cause a problem acutely.
[01:40:45.572 --> 01:40:50.095]  In other words, it takes time to have this exposure before you're going to notice the difference.
[01:40:50.095 --> 01:40:53.377]  You don't get lung cancer after smoking one pack of cigarettes.
[01:40:53.377 --> 01:40:58.460]  It takes many years, if not decades, to have that exposure before you have a problem or a complication.
[01:40:58.460 --> 01:41:04.624]  Similarly, exposure to these cell phones is going to take 5, 10, 20, 30 years before you're going to see an increase.
[01:41:04.984 --> 01:41:08.846]  Well, it's being reported again, like AP, Reuters, you name it, that they're already seeing that.
[01:41:08.846 --> 01:41:14.549]  And then you'll see the cell phone makers come out and say, well, we don't completely agree with that, and it's not conclusive.
[01:41:14.549 --> 01:41:16.230]  It sounds just like the cigarette makers.
[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:40.643]  Even a decade ago, saying we didn't know this caused cancer, we're not even saying it does cause cancer.
[01:41:40.643 --> 01:41:46.607]  And you go back 50 years ago, they said, they had doctors on TV and lab coats going, having a sore throat?
[01:41:46.607 --> 01:41:48.028]  Smoke an extra merit.
[01:41:49.836 --> 01:41:55.720]  And the telecommunications industry is a far bigger and more powerful industry than the tobacco industry.
[01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:56.980]  There's no comparison.
[01:41:56.980 --> 01:41:59.662]  I think it may be one order of magnitude larger.
[01:41:59.662 --> 01:42:08.848]  So they have a lot more income and power to play with and manipulate the perception.
[01:42:08.848 --> 01:42:10.549]  There's so many things to talk about.
[01:42:10.549 --> 01:42:12.510]  What are some of the other things that are on your radar?
[01:42:15.026 --> 01:42:21.432]  Well, I really believe that the reliance on drugs as a solution for health is a problem.
[01:42:21.432 --> 01:42:36.768]  One of the primary issues that we face, and the most significant concern, is that it's becoming progressively more expensive for the drug companies to actually have these drugs approved, and then even once they're approved, then they have to defend
[01:42:37.408 --> 01:42:42.931]  Lawsuits typically resulting in billions if not tens of billions of dollars for the consequence of people taking them.
[01:42:42.931 --> 01:42:52.396]  So there's this gradual, because of those two elements, there's this gradual shift towards a model where they're not using drugs anymore, they're going to be using vaccines.
[01:42:52.396 --> 01:43:01.181]  Which, because of legislation passed, what, 25 years ago, they are exempted from any prosecution and they're a lot easier to pass.
[01:43:01.841 --> 01:43:13.967]  So, you know, they're going to manipulate the whole system so that they're actually not voluntary, so that they either become mandatory, so there's tens of billions of dollars of profit, there's this gradual shift.
[01:43:13.967 --> 01:43:22.351]  I mean, there's probably hundreds or more vaccines that are in the pipeline right now for targeting for our population, and that's definitely a concern.
[01:43:22.711 --> 01:43:24.133]  I just learned something new.
[01:43:24.133 --> 01:43:39.249]  I mean I know about all the new classes of vaccines that cure depression or and that's in quotes or smoking or cocaine or or anger or or or vaccines that make you calm and not have anxiety anymore and I go read the different patents most of them are
[01:43:39.970 --> 01:43:51.297]  Literally genetically engineered viruses, or the equivalent of nanotech, that go in and destroy the neurons so that you can't even receive those different chemicals in your brain.
[01:43:51.297 --> 01:43:57.161]  I mean, this is the equivalent of a viral lobotomy.
[01:43:57.161 --> 01:44:02.404]  They have other types that create plaques, other types that then attack hormones.
[01:44:02.404 --> 01:44:05.006]  And I want you to speak to this, but I had never put two and two together.
[01:44:05.606 --> 01:44:22.017]  That's why they admit they're moving almost exclusively to vaccines, because that'll be the new delivery system via manipulation of your body, of Pharmakeia, and they've got this body of law with the Vaccine Damage Fund and the national security angle.
[01:44:22.017 --> 01:44:23.178]  That is nightmarish.
[01:44:23.178 --> 01:44:31.663]  So what specifically can you say about them coming out and saying, look, we got a vaccine that will cure you being upset, but then it blocks your endorphins.
[01:44:31.663 --> 01:44:32.644]  I mean, this is scary.
[01:44:33.649 --> 01:44:36.792]  Well, it's this immunity from prosecution that's the most concern.
[01:44:36.792 --> 01:44:50.763]  If they can really sell these things, and in the case of last year of the swine flu, which I think is, you know, our site's been around for 12 years, but I think our most significant contribution is really being a primary catalyst for educating consumers that the vaccine was nonsense.
[01:44:50.763 --> 01:44:53.765]  And as a result of that, 70% of the U.S.
[01:44:53.765 --> 01:44:55.947]  public chose not to get the vaccine despite the
[01:44:56.858 --> 01:45:02.743]  And you were vindicated, because everything you and many others talked about came out to be absolutely right and more.
[01:45:02.743 --> 01:45:03.364]  Oh sure, they're right.
[01:45:03.364 --> 01:45:05.325]  It's so easy to predict these things, Alex.
[01:45:05.325 --> 01:45:11.650]  I mean, especially with the flus, because all we have to do is look at Australia, which is literally six months ahead of us.
[01:45:11.650 --> 01:45:14.913]  You look at their experience, and we're going to exactly replicate it.
[01:45:14.913 --> 01:45:16.034]  It's no mystery.
[01:45:16.034 --> 01:45:17.055]  This is not rocket science.
[01:45:17.055 --> 01:45:21.919]  That's right, they had deaths, they had massive brain damage, all neurological.
[01:45:24.306 --> 01:45:28.347]  Correct me if I'm wrong, almost all flus start in the other hemisphere or in Asia.
[01:45:28.347 --> 01:45:32.688]  So we really should always know what type of flu is coming around the bend and any type of
[01:45:49.053 --> 01:45:54.015]  And the flu or any infectious disease, for the most part, is not something to be distressed about.
[01:45:54.015 --> 01:46:05.559]  Because if you're following Healthy Lifestyles, if you go to my site, it's on the homepage, we've got a whole 40-page report on how you can, there's no charge for how you can optimize your lifestyle based on beginner, intermediate, or advanced models.
[01:46:06.019 --> 01:46:06.480]  I think so.
[01:46:24.414 --> 01:46:26.997]  It's virtually impossible to get sick.
[01:46:26.997 --> 01:46:28.278]  I mean, you just don't get sick.
[01:46:28.278 --> 01:46:29.859]  You don't forget about the vaccine.
[01:46:29.859 --> 01:46:33.603]  You don't have to worry about even any downtime because colds or flus in the winter come.
[01:46:33.603 --> 01:46:40.630]  And I can't tell you, you know, it's just almost universal, the responses that we get from people who adopt these strategies and change their lifestyle.
[01:46:40.630 --> 01:46:44.514]  And they can experience this, you know, relief from these infections.
[01:46:45.407 --> 01:46:52.812]  But then going back to what happened last year, as you know, but I'd like you to speak to this, Dr. Mercola.
[01:46:52.812 --> 01:47:02.739]  They did Canadian studies and others that showed if you took the H1N1 vaccine, it lowered your immunity by 50% to the regular seasonal.
[01:47:02.739 --> 01:47:03.459]  Yeah.
[01:47:03.459 --> 01:47:14.807]  Quantify that from what Dr. Blaylock and others have said here, medical doctors, that basically your body gets overwhelmed, then it doesn't know how to respond to a real threat.
[01:47:15.367 --> 01:47:16.447]  You're absolutely correct.
[01:47:16.447 --> 01:47:26.171]  If you get the swine flu, the studies have conclusively proven that it actually increases your risk for getting the regular seasonal flu.
[01:47:26.171 --> 01:47:31.953]  So what do you think they did in the United States, and I think in most other countries of the world, with the flu vaccine this year?
[01:47:31.953 --> 01:47:34.273]  They combined them both, and you don't have a choice.
[01:47:34.273 --> 01:47:35.594]  If you get one, you get the other.
[01:47:36.791 --> 01:47:45.075]  It's beyond crazy what they're doing, but it makes perfect sense if you're one of the executives of the drug industry because you're going to be reaping profit.
[01:47:45.075 --> 01:47:47.677]  And obviously, they want a captive audience.
[01:47:47.677 --> 01:47:58.642]  They go lobby billions of dollars through your state and federal legislature, and more and more we're seeing the government attempt to try to force vaccines on people, and they're coming out with hundreds of new vaccines.
[01:47:58.642 --> 01:48:04.825]  As you pointed out, medicine is shifting over almost entirely to vaccines because of the liability protection
[01:48:05.385 --> 01:48:12.993]  This is a nightmare, but at the same time, record low numbers of people took the flu shot.
[01:48:12.993 --> 01:48:15.635]  It's starting the same thing this year.
[01:48:15.635 --> 01:48:17.677]  How do you see the system striking back?
[01:48:17.677 --> 01:48:26.306]  I mean, they want to make their hundreds of billions, and because of Mercola and Infowars.com and all the other great people out there, folks are waking up.
[01:48:26.306 --> 01:48:27.968]  What do you see the establishment doing?
[01:48:29.546 --> 01:48:30.186]  I don't know.
[01:48:30.186 --> 01:48:34.027]  I don't really get into those projections too much, but they're going to come out.
[01:48:34.027 --> 01:48:35.548]  They're going to want it.
[01:48:35.548 --> 01:48:38.249]  I think the immediate threat is they're going to make it mandatory.
[01:48:38.249 --> 01:48:56.334]  And we're partnering with one of the top pro-vaccine safety sites in the world, which is the National Vaccine Information Center, NDIC.org, and we're really developing a massive consumer awareness component where they're lobbying for people to get together in their own local communities and hit their state legislators.
[01:48:57.014 --> 01:49:05.178]  They will prevent this from happening, but I think that's the next big battle, is to make sure right now that we don't shift to a mandatory vaccine system.
[01:49:05.178 --> 01:49:16.583]  Because right now we have the freedom to choose not to get it, even though there are... Essentially, the freedom is somewhat nullified if you have a child that's going to school, because they're going to prevent entry into both school systems, unless you're vaccinated.
[01:49:16.583 --> 01:49:20.705]  But you can always go home to school, or you can go to a state that doesn't require it and has a philosophical exemption.
[01:49:21.690 --> 01:49:27.313]  It's not as bad as it could be, that's for certain, if these mandatory vaccine laws get passed.
[01:49:27.313 --> 01:49:28.334]  We're going to break here in a moment.
[01:49:28.334 --> 01:49:32.456]  We're going to come back and take a few calls for Dr. Joseph Mercola.
[01:49:32.456 --> 01:49:45.143]  But briefly, what are you seeing on the front of GMO crops, cross-species chimeras, like the GMO salmon, the move to not even let us know if it's GMO in the stores?
[01:49:46.653 --> 01:49:47.694]  Well, it's a big, big issue.
[01:49:47.694 --> 01:49:49.615]  I think we're going to be very successful in that.
[01:49:49.615 --> 01:49:54.437]  We're partnering with Jeffrey Smith, who was just on Dr. Oz yesterday, and got a very favorable response.
[01:49:54.437 --> 01:49:57.159]  But it's just providing people, the consumers can make the choice here.
[01:49:57.159 --> 01:50:02.982]  If they can vote with their pocketbooks once they understand the issue, they can actually choose not to purchase this.
[01:50:02.982 --> 01:50:11.407]  And just like they did in Europe, once their profits go down, the people who are the industries who are manufacturing this, they will choose not to.
[01:50:11.407 --> 01:50:15.449]  So we can easily defeat that without any legislation, without any governmental intervention.
[01:50:15.449 --> 01:50:16.490]  It's a really simple process.
[01:50:17.722 --> 01:50:18.202]  Amazing.
[01:50:18.202 --> 01:50:20.865]  Dr. Mercola is our guest.
[01:50:20.865 --> 01:50:26.189]  Briefly, as we go to break, what are some of the other things that you're looking at right now?
[01:50:26.189 --> 01:50:27.390]  Well, it's one of the most exciting ones.
[01:50:27.390 --> 01:50:31.213]  Fluoride is a big issue, and then also mercury, which is another toxin, of course.
[01:50:31.213 --> 01:50:39.760]  And we're working with Charlie Brown for the Consumers for Dental Choice to help outlaw mercury amalgam in the United States, which is one of our big projects.
[01:50:40.208 --> 01:50:47.133]  So, Free Humanity is on the march, but Big Pharma and their witch doctor cartels, they're striking back.
[01:50:47.133 --> 01:50:47.953]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:50:47.953 --> 01:50:51.156]  This is the GCN Radio Network, GCNLive.com.
[01:50:51.156 --> 01:50:58.741]  We're going to try to keep Dr. Mercola for a couple more segments to take your calls, and I'm going to get into a big news blitz on WikiLeaks, the economy, and a lot more.
[01:50:58.741 --> 01:51:01.003]  Stay with us.

[01:51:04.925 --> 01:51:08.728]  My name is Span, and I'm 68 years old, and I live in Vermont.
[01:51:09.116 --> 01:51:13.860]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[01:51:13.860 --> 01:51:15.941]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[01:51:15.941 --> 01:51:17.643]  Made me feel breathless.
[01:51:17.643 --> 01:51:22.086]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[01:51:22.086 --> 01:51:23.167]  Nothing did anything.
[01:51:23.167 --> 01:51:27.330]  Heart and Body Extract is very powerful, very effective, and works quickly.
[01:51:27.330 --> 01:51:31.273]  I saw one of Sharon's ads and ordered Heart and Body Extract.
[01:51:31.273 --> 01:51:33.915]  I noticed a difference quickly, within days.
[01:51:34.355 --> 01:51:39.379]  The episodes became less frequent and by a month had completely vanished.

[01:52:00.396 --> 01:52:01.698]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:01.698 --> 01:52:07.305]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:07.305 --> 01:52:12.311]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:12.311 --> 01:52:17.898]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:52:17.898 --> 01:52:19.720]  So, our friends at Solutions from Science,
[01:52:19.980 --> 01:52:20.480]  We're good to go!

[01:52:49.442 --> 01:52:57.067]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:57.067 --> 01:53:00.529]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[01:54:13.668 --> 01:54:17.012]  Steve, Debra, Donna, Larry, Chris and many others.
[01:54:17.012 --> 01:54:18.754]  The toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:54:25.469 --> 01:54:29.172]  We've got some big WikiLeaks developments coming up after he leaves us.
[01:54:29.172 --> 01:54:31.734]  Also, huge TSA development.
[01:54:31.734 --> 01:54:35.436]  In fact, I'm going to mention that now and then I promise we're going right to your calls.
[01:54:35.436 --> 01:54:41.661]  Dr. Mercola, the naked body scanners, I mean, they've had all these top radiation experts, John Hopkins, you name it.
[01:54:41.661 --> 01:54:45.264]  Dr. Love come out and say, you know, horrible radiation exposure.
[01:54:45.264 --> 01:54:46.385]  The pilots have said no.
[01:54:47.245 --> 01:55:05.613]  But now I've got a USA Today article and we have a PrisonPlanet.com article by Paul Watson about the revolt, actually Steve Watson, the revolt by TSA agents because it turns out there was a secret federal review of the radiation and they've kept that secret so there's been a quiet revolt of the TSA workers.
[01:55:05.613 --> 01:55:08.394]  Are they not the ones that are really being exposed?
[01:55:08.394 --> 01:55:10.035]  Being around this day in day out?
[01:55:10.913 --> 01:55:18.826]  Well, I'm just not familiar with the specifics of how that machinery operates and the type of shielding they have on it, but it's certainly got potential.
[01:55:18.826 --> 01:55:22.312]  And it's certainly true for X-ray, regular X-ray technicians.
[01:55:22.890 --> 01:55:25.172]  That is the risk, and they have to be assessed.
[01:55:25.172 --> 01:55:31.058]  I think I read something online this morning that also addressed the maintenance of these machines.
[01:55:31.058 --> 01:55:41.509]  For the most part, that information has not been released, which is another source of concern, because the machine may operate properly when it's maintained, but who's looking to make sure that it doesn't deviate from that?
[01:55:41.509 --> 01:55:46.034]  It's leaking significant amounts of radiation that it wasn't designed to.
[01:55:46.374 --> 01:55:56.163]  Well, we've had radiologists on the broadcast several times and we have like the New York Times saying that one machine has 50 times the radiation they first said.
[01:55:56.163 --> 01:55:59.566]  The other system, there's two, has 20 times at least.
[01:55:59.566 --> 01:56:04.131]  And you can look at the images released by the government, you can see the bones and the fingers.
[01:56:04.631 --> 01:56:07.532]  That's similar to a dental x-ray.
[01:56:07.532 --> 01:56:09.873]  So these are very high-powered.
[01:56:09.873 --> 01:56:13.955]  And I mean, there's no doubt that it's a serious issue.
[01:56:13.955 --> 01:56:16.496]  It just shows how crazy this has gotten.
[01:56:16.496 --> 01:56:17.956]  Let's talk to Steve in Florida.
[01:56:17.956 --> 01:56:19.477]  You're on the air with Dr. Mercola.
[01:56:19.477 --> 01:56:20.818]  Go ahead.
[01:56:20.818 --> 01:56:22.218]  Yeah, good afternoon, Alex.
[01:56:22.218 --> 01:56:24.719]  And good afternoon, Dr. Mercola.
[01:56:24.719 --> 01:56:29.401]  Dr. Mercola, before I ask my question, I just wanted to say that I really appreciate what you've been doing.
[01:56:29.401 --> 01:56:31.302]  I get your daily e-newsletter.
[01:56:32.012 --> 01:56:44.104]  And I've been able to pass on so much of your information to people through e-mails or just talking to them and I just really appreciate all the work you've done and the documentation you've put out to back up what you're saying.
[01:56:44.104 --> 01:56:45.605]  The thing I wanted to ask is this.
[01:56:45.605 --> 01:56:54.894]  My chiropractor, who's very much on the same page with you as far as all the nutritional stuff and health stuff, he made a very radical statement.
[01:56:54.894 --> 01:56:56.356]  I wanted to see what you think about this.
[01:56:56.980 --> 01:57:00.143]  He said, there really is no such thing as disease.
[01:57:00.143 --> 01:57:05.567]  The problem with all these so-called diseases is you have a breakdown at the cellular level.
[01:57:08.451 --> 01:57:10.492]  So, what is your take on that?
[01:57:10.492 --> 01:57:13.473]  Well, thank you for your kind comment.
[01:57:13.473 --> 01:57:21.516]  With respect to your chiropractor's comment, I believe it's kind of like day and night when you come to disease and health.
[01:57:21.516 --> 01:57:29.799]  And really, the strategy that most physicians who are interested in improving people's health and focusing on wellness will focus on getting people healthy.
[01:57:29.799 --> 01:57:34.921]  You know, when I went to medical school, the focus was the exact converse.
[01:57:34.921 --> 01:57:37.362]  The focus was almost entirely and exclusively on disease.
[01:57:38.142 --> 01:57:41.866]  So if you get a person healthy, it's really like light and darkness.
[01:57:41.866 --> 01:57:44.088]  You can't have darkness if there's light.
[01:57:44.088 --> 01:57:46.870]  Similarly, you can't have disease if you're healthy.
[01:57:46.870 --> 01:57:50.033]  So I think there's many elements of truth to what Karpeck said.
[01:57:51.576 --> 01:57:54.340]  And I mean, obviously, we're designed to die.
[01:57:54.340 --> 01:57:55.921]  It's just you can extend that out.
[01:57:55.921 --> 01:57:58.545]  So, of course, everything goes to a cellular level.
[01:57:58.545 --> 01:58:07.215]  That's what we're made up of, is different communities of cell tissues working in concert together, directed by our brain.
[01:58:08.362 --> 01:58:31.961]  Yeah, and obviously we're all going to die at some point, but one of my areas of interest is anti-aging, and I can tell you some of the most exciting research now is pointing to telomere lengthening, and telomeres are little end caps of your DNA pieces on the chromosome, and there's a basal rate at which they degenerate, and once you reach a certain limit, like 5,000 end caps of pairs, or base pairs actually, you die.
[01:58:31.961 --> 01:58:37.205]  So the exciting research is to actually lengthen these telomeres, and you can actually reverse aging, which we'll probably have in 20, 30 years.
[01:58:37.785 --> 01:58:38.326]  Incredible.
[01:58:38.326 --> 01:58:44.531]  I want to hear about that when we come back.
[01:58:44.531 --> 01:58:48.495]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:52.984 --> 01:58:54.726]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:54.726 --> 01:59:00.451]  You've heard me talk about the delicious, easy-to-fix, and very storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:59:00.451 --> 01:59:05.215]  I've told you for years that eFoodsDirect has the best storable food on the planet.
[01:59:05.215 --> 01:59:08.959]  Now it's that time of year again, and their holiday special is here.

[01:59:53.894 --> 01:59:56.280]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.280 --> 01:59:59.047]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.629 --> 02:00:10.471]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.471 --> 02:00:12.052]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.052 --> 02:00:13.613]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.613 --> 02:00:17.795]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.795 --> 02:00:21.877]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.847 --> 02:00:41.717]  Dr. Joseph Mercola is our guest ophthalmopathic physician, previously headed up major medical centers, and he joins us now.
[02:00:41.717 --> 02:00:44.979]  I want to go to your phone calls, but he was bringing up life extension.
[02:00:44.979 --> 02:00:53.906]  Let's just do that in the next longer segment coming up, because I want everybody to be able to hear that, and some stations don't carry this short segment very, very
[02:00:54.946 --> 02:00:55.926]  Important information.
[02:00:55.926 --> 02:01:03.848]  I know the elites are obsessed with this and I know in rats and certain types of insects and worms, they've already doubled, tripled life expectancy.
[02:01:03.848 --> 02:01:04.788]  It's amazing.
[02:01:04.788 --> 02:01:06.969]  So we're going to discuss that with him coming up.
[02:01:06.969 --> 02:01:09.430]  But right now, let's go to Debra in Maine.
[02:01:09.430 --> 02:01:10.890]  You're on the air with Dr. Mercola.
[02:01:10.890 --> 02:01:12.690]  Go ahead, Debra.
[02:01:12.690 --> 02:01:13.531]  Hey, Alex.
[02:01:13.531 --> 02:01:14.811]  Hi, Dr. Mercola.
[02:01:14.811 --> 02:01:15.411]  Hi, Debra.
[02:01:15.411 --> 02:01:16.251]  I'm really nervous.
[02:01:16.251 --> 02:01:19.892]  I feel like I'm a lucky American who gets to talk to, like, Brad Pitt or something.
[02:01:19.892 --> 02:01:20.932]  It makes me sound like a geek.
[02:01:20.932 --> 02:01:23.433]  But I'm a huge fan, actually, of both of you.
[02:01:25.219 --> 02:01:28.400]  Thank you, both of you, for everything you do.
[02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:33.082]  Dr. Mercola, I want to ask you, I've always been pretty healthy.
[02:01:33.082 --> 02:01:36.784]  I have my own personal story with pharmaceuticals.
[02:01:36.784 --> 02:01:42.447]  I got off them because I was in a position of asking my doctor, why is this happening?
[02:01:42.447 --> 02:01:43.387]  Why is this happening?
[02:01:43.387 --> 02:01:44.988]  And they just didn't have an answer for me.
[02:01:44.988 --> 02:01:49.870]  Well, they've always got more drugs to treat the drug-induced problems they've given you.
[02:01:49.870 --> 02:01:51.030]  Yeah, that's exactly it.
[02:01:51.030 --> 02:01:53.651]  I was having epileptic seizures like 15 years ago.
[02:01:53.651 --> 02:01:54.392]  I was in my early 20s.
[02:01:55.576 --> 02:02:02.659]  And, uh, I, you know, I was never extremely smart or anything, but I just was like, something's wrong with this picture.
[02:02:02.659 --> 02:02:07.942]  And ultimately the drugs made me feel like I was drunk and stupid.
[02:02:07.942 --> 02:02:11.544]  And so ultimately I went into the doctor and said, I'm not taking these anymore.
[02:02:11.544 --> 02:02:14.605]  And, uh, anyway, so that was my own personal story.
[02:02:14.605 --> 02:02:16.206]  That's kind of how I saw the light.
[02:02:16.206 --> 02:02:20.568]  Um, I read, I read most of the books that you recommend on your website.
[02:02:20.568 --> 02:02:20.648]  Um,
[02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:26.525]  My question, I'm so frustrated, I feel like I want to pull my hair out and hit people over the head with bricks.
[02:02:26.525 --> 02:02:29.048]  Why is it so hard for people?
[02:02:29.048 --> 02:02:31.090]  What is so hard to understand?
[02:02:31.090 --> 02:02:36.655]  About the system?
[02:02:36.655 --> 02:02:39.057]  I find it so easy to be healthy.
[02:02:39.057 --> 02:02:41.279]  I'll tell you what's going on.
[02:02:41.279 --> 02:02:42.280]  The average person
[02:02:43.482 --> 02:02:50.168]  Just kind of goes through life and accepts what they're given, and they're good people, so they think of everybody else as good.
[02:02:50.168 --> 02:02:53.131]  They don't understand the predatory nature, but I appreciate your call.
[02:02:53.131 --> 02:02:55.573]  Let's get Dr. Mercola's take on what you were talking about.
[02:02:56.274 --> 02:02:57.955]  Well, it's what I referenced earlier.
[02:02:57.955 --> 02:03:07.721]  I heard that, but there's this massive media campaign and marketing that these drug companies, they're very successful at marketing.
[02:03:07.721 --> 02:03:13.945]  They have tens of hundreds of billions of dollars to purchase the finest minds on the planet, and they corrupt the system at every level.
[02:03:14.765 --> 02:03:34.474]  From the journals, the publications that are accepted in the journals, to the experts that are appointed to the federal committees, to the chairmen of major departments at medical schools and universities that are really heavily subsidized by the drug companies and really in debt to them, so they were able to steer their agenda through this process.
[02:03:34.474 --> 02:03:39.977]  And the media carries that, and it's no surprise that most people believe it.
[02:03:39.977 --> 02:03:42.398]  I mean, it's exactly what you would expect.
[02:03:42.738 --> 02:03:42.999]  No.
[02:03:42.999 --> 02:03:43.059]  No.
[02:03:57.435 --> 02:04:16.533]  Well, that's a great point, and if you look at a lot of the big drug companies, they are the progeny of the original snake oil salesmen who were, you know, mixing opium up with alcohol and saying, this will cure your ails, and they don't have an incentive to want to prevent disease.
[02:04:16.533 --> 02:04:21.858]  They want to treat the disease, and I think it's that simple equation that really boils it all down.
[02:04:22.839 --> 02:04:23.420]  One quick question.
[02:04:23.420 --> 02:04:28.188]  We're about to go to break, come back in one final long segment and take more calls.
[02:04:28.188 --> 02:04:32.275]  I'll ask the question now, then we'll come back and get your answer on the other side.
[02:04:32.275 --> 02:04:32.416]  But...
[02:04:33.587 --> 02:04:50.151]  I also have seen the statistics in the Western world, Europe and the United States mainly, that neurological disorders, early onset of what they call Alzheimer's type diseases, people having seizures, I mean, it's just epidemic.
[02:04:50.151 --> 02:04:55.272]  Epidemics in childhood cancer, something unknown 50, 60 years ago.
[02:04:55.272 --> 02:04:59.073]  Let's get your brief take on that, then life extension, and then a bunch of other phone calls.
[02:04:59.073 --> 02:04:59.533]  Stay with us.
[02:05:02.136 --> 02:05:06.160]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:05:06.160 --> 02:05:09.404]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:05:09.404 --> 02:05:14.209]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:05:14.209 --> 02:05:20.616]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:05:20.616 --> 02:05:22.838]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:05:23.359 --> 02:05:23.679]  Tim Geithner?
[02:05:23.679 --> 02:05:24.200]  Bernanke?
[02:05:24.200 --> 02:05:24.980]  They're arsonists!
[02:05:24.980 --> 02:05:26.141]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:05:26.141 --> 02:05:28.383]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:05:42.273 --> 02:05:49.556]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:06:53.076 --> 02:06:53.416]  Thank you!
[02:07:00.387 --> 02:07:04.930]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:04.930 --> 02:07:05.851]  Number 1.
[02:07:05.851 --> 02:07:09.274]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:09.274 --> 02:07:10.134]  Number 2.
[02:07:10.134 --> 02:07:15.018]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:15.018 --> 02:07:15.758]  It's true.
[02:07:15.758 --> 02:07:20.642]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:20.642 --> 02:07:21.463]  Number 3.
[02:07:21.463 --> 02:07:25.045]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:25.045 --> 02:07:28.748]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:28.948 --> 02:07:29.749]  Number 4.
[02:07:29.749 --> 02:07:32.511]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:32.511 --> 02:07:36.195]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:36.195 --> 02:07:36.976]  Number 5.
[02:07:36.976 --> 02:07:41.119]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:41.119 --> 02:07:45.884]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:46.164 --> 02:07:50.350]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:50.350 --> 02:07:52.132]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:52.132 --> 02:07:54.395]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:07:54.395 --> 02:07:56.739]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:08:19.454 --> 02:08:21.217]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:21.217 --> 02:08:22.178]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:08:24.735 --> 02:08:29.099]  You know, we're talking about bisphenol A, one of hundreds of things in our environment hurting us.
[02:08:29.099 --> 02:08:34.563]  The federal government admits just a little bit of it on your finger massively lowers male fertility.
[02:08:34.563 --> 02:08:40.569]  Oh, I'm sure that makes John P. Holdren, who openly says he wants to sterilize us, the White House scientists are very upset.
[02:08:40.569 --> 02:08:42.090]  But here's medical news today.
[02:08:42.090 --> 02:08:43.891]  95% of U.S.
[02:08:43.891 --> 02:08:51.018]  paper money tainted with bisphenol A, and it goes on to say that in plastic bottles it's locked in.
[02:08:51.678 --> 02:08:55.159]  So it's the microwaving and things that really releases it.
[02:08:55.159 --> 02:08:59.339]  But in the money, it's just like the printer ink, it comes right off on you.
[02:08:59.339 --> 02:09:03.660]  I mean, Dr. Mercola, does it ever end?
[02:09:03.660 --> 02:09:04.460]  Well, it's a challenge.
[02:09:04.460 --> 02:09:09.841]  I mean, there's certainly some benefits of living in an advanced industrial society, but, you know, it comes at a price.
[02:09:09.841 --> 02:09:16.642]  So you need to be diligent about what those risks are and minimize your exposures.
[02:09:16.642 --> 02:09:20.503]  Now, getting back to the question I launched right before the break,
[02:09:22.259 --> 02:09:27.762]  What's your view on that point?
[02:09:27.762 --> 02:09:36.767]  Well, some of the diseases you mentioned certainly are as a result of exposure to these toxins and environmental hazards.
[02:09:36.767 --> 02:09:45.952]  You know, the ones that come to mind would be some of the mercury's exposure, vaccines, and the other contaminants that are in vaccines, aluminum.
[02:09:45.952 --> 02:09:48.174]  And then, of course, the
[02:09:49.312 --> 02:09:53.636]  It's a combination of factors, but one of the things I want to mention while I'm remembering is some of the new research that's come up.
[02:09:53.636 --> 02:09:57.620]  It's really pretty intriguing because Alzheimer's, as you mentioned, is an increasing epidemic to the point where
[02:10:13.362 --> 02:10:16.328]  More than one in three people are projected to eventually have this.
[02:10:16.328 --> 02:10:18.112]  It's not pretty to lose your mind.
[02:10:18.112 --> 02:10:21.460]  But we're finding that one of the best things to do is follow a healthy lifestyle.
[02:10:21.460 --> 02:10:23.705]  Exercise, get your vitamin D levels up, avoid the sugar.
[02:10:24.597 --> 02:10:30.121]  But also, even if you have Alzheimer's, what's been found recently to be highly effective is coconut oil.
[02:10:30.121 --> 02:10:45.112]  And about a tablespoon a day has been shown to produce massive improvement in a number of people and really get their sanity back and their brain functioning, which is really quite extraordinary to consider how simple food like this can give such a powerful benefit.
[02:10:45.112 --> 02:10:47.573]  Well, I mean, isn't food really the original medicine?
[02:10:47.573 --> 02:10:49.435]  I mean, it's what we're designed to eat.
[02:10:51.195 --> 02:11:03.424]  Well, but there seems to be some specific benefit to coconut with respect to how it biochemically interacts with the brain and providing sort of bypasses to some of the dysfunction that occurs in advanced degenerative brain disease.
[02:11:03.424 --> 02:11:05.465]  So, it's particularly intriguing.
[02:11:05.465 --> 02:11:06.266]  I couldn't agree more.
[02:11:06.266 --> 02:11:13.190]  One of the good strategies you could also use, and I highly recommend people consider, would be organic vegetable juicing.
[02:11:14.211 --> 02:11:14.932]  I think so.
[02:11:35.745 --> 02:11:38.727]  We've all got to make the commitment.
[02:11:38.727 --> 02:11:47.311]  Back over 10 years ago, I was in really good shape, and then I just got out of shape, and it's very hard to get back into shape and start eating properly again, but I'm slowly moving there.
[02:11:47.311 --> 02:11:50.612]  But it's something that freedom lovers all have to do.
[02:11:50.612 --> 02:11:54.674]  I mean, this revolution against tyranny starts with our bodies.
[02:11:54.674 --> 02:11:57.056]  Let's take another call from Donna in California.
[02:11:57.056 --> 02:11:58.296]  We've got to move quick now.
[02:11:58.296 --> 02:12:00.918]  Donna, you're on the air with Dr. Joseph Mercola.
[02:12:00.918 --> 02:12:01.278]  Go ahead.
[02:12:02.364 --> 02:12:03.304]  Oh great.
[02:12:03.304 --> 02:12:04.445]  Hi Alex.
[02:12:04.445 --> 02:12:04.585]  Hi.
[02:12:04.585 --> 02:12:05.605]  First time caller.
[02:12:05.605 --> 02:12:06.726]  Hi Dr. Mercola.
[02:12:06.726 --> 02:12:07.186]  Hi.
[02:12:07.186 --> 02:12:09.587]  I'm here in Palm Springs, California as you said.
[02:12:09.587 --> 02:12:14.449]  I'm just very excited to be on air and I appreciate you taking my call.
[02:12:14.449 --> 02:12:17.430]  And I'm a first time subscriber.
[02:12:18.190 --> 02:12:21.292]  I just started listening to you and I'm spreading the word.
[02:12:21.292 --> 02:12:27.035]  I just wanted to let you know that I'm out calling these companies about the best female and all this other stuff.
[02:12:27.035 --> 02:12:31.297]  So I try to do one or two a day before I go to work.
[02:12:31.297 --> 02:12:37.900]  Anyway, I just want to thank you and I appreciate you guys and keep up the good work and if there's anything I can do give me a call.
[02:12:38.300 --> 02:12:39.501]  Alright, well you're a sweetheart.
[02:12:39.501 --> 02:12:44.803]  Do you have any questions for our... Yeah, actually I do Alex, thanks.
[02:12:44.803 --> 02:12:55.007]  I was curious about, because you've talked about the bisphenol and the plastics, and I'm looking at my cupboards and my storage and I've got all these canned goods and things that are in plastic.
[02:12:55.007 --> 02:12:58.648]  Is there a way to know exactly which ones to get rid of?
[02:13:00.422 --> 02:13:04.263]  You know, is there a list of plastic companies or whatever we shouldn't be using?
[02:13:04.263 --> 02:13:05.484]  Well, that's another great point.
[02:13:05.484 --> 02:13:17.168]  The little juice boxes, most of the things like Capri Sun, you name it, they have plastic lining in them and a lot of them, it's made of bisphenol A. Correct, Dr. Mercola?
[02:13:17.688 --> 02:13:24.393]  Yeah, the general principle is, and it's important to understand, that 90% of the money that Americans spend on food is for processed foods.
[02:13:24.393 --> 02:13:28.796]  And when you process the foods, there's a risk, because you have to package it in a way that's going to store it.
[02:13:28.796 --> 02:13:31.518]  And most of these packaging materials are fraught with danger.
[02:13:31.518 --> 02:13:39.684]  So, you know, occasionally exposure is not going to be a big issue, but on a regular basis, you really want to move away from that and find foods that are packaged in glass.
[02:13:40.532 --> 02:13:41.393]  That's a key thing.
[02:13:41.393 --> 02:13:56.505]  Another element that is commonly overlooked is that these vegetables and fruits, once you package them and process them, normally they have methanol, but it's combined with pectin, a fruit or vegetable, and if you eat it raw or fresh, it's not a problem.
[02:13:56.505 --> 02:13:59.547]  But once you package it, this methanol gradually dissociates.
[02:13:59.547 --> 02:14:04.471]  Methanol is another term for wood alcohol, and it can cause significant neurological complications.
[02:14:04.471 --> 02:14:08.854]  So, really, the general take-home message is stay away from processed foods as much as possible.
[02:14:10.696 --> 02:14:24.735]  You know, I didn't know that until a few months ago, but correct me if I'm wrong, what you're saying is that when you take canned peaches or whatever the case may be, the natural things in it starts breaking down into something toxic.
[02:14:25.512 --> 02:14:27.613]  Well, it's liberated.
[02:14:27.613 --> 02:14:38.078]  Normally, it's connected in a way that doesn't cause a problem in your body because it doesn't have an enzyme to dissociate it, but it breaks down spontaneously once it's processed over time, so the longer it is, the worse the problem.
[02:14:38.078 --> 02:14:40.119]  And you can have significant complications.
[02:14:40.119 --> 02:14:48.324]  In fact, many researchers believe it's a primary factor for the cause of multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases.
[02:14:48.324 --> 02:14:49.104]  Amazing.
[02:14:49.104 --> 02:14:50.184]  Donna, God bless.
[02:14:50.184 --> 02:14:51.965]  Let's talk to Larry in California.
[02:14:51.965 --> 02:14:52.806]  Larry, you're on the air.
[02:14:55.836 --> 02:14:57.517]  Yeah, hello Alex.
[02:14:57.517 --> 02:14:58.557]  Hey.
[02:14:58.557 --> 02:15:09.120]  Hey Alex, I'm an ex-convict there, and I'm telling you man, quit bad-mouthing us ex-convicts here in California.
[02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:12.021]  Alright Larry, I appreciate your call.
[02:15:12.021 --> 02:15:13.181]  I know that's a prank call.
[02:15:13.181 --> 02:15:17.722]  I don't really talk too much about ex-convicts, but good to hear from you, Larry.
[02:15:17.722 --> 02:15:19.423]  Let's talk to Chris in Maryland.
[02:15:19.423 --> 02:15:21.323]  We don't screen our calls, folks.
[02:15:21.323 --> 02:15:23.344]  Chris in Maryland, you're on the air with Dr. Mercola.
[02:15:23.871 --> 02:15:26.093]  Hey guys, I'm finally glad to finally get on.
[02:15:26.093 --> 02:15:49.774]  It's hard to get on here, but my question for your guest is that I was seriously operated on by the military and I have a feeling that I might be a goner, but if martial law is called, I told my wife and kids that we will bug out of here to get away from the populated areas, and since they took out my terminal ileum and I have B12 deficiency, is there some way that I can bypass that
[02:15:50.120 --> 02:15:54.683]  To get the B12, because I have a feeling if I don't get it, I'll be a dead man.
[02:15:54.683 --> 02:15:59.646]  Well, eventually you'll die, but before that you'll become blind and develop other neurological complications.
[02:15:59.646 --> 02:16:08.532]  But you're right, the B12 is a very large vitamin, as large as the ones we know of, and it's required to combine with intrinsic bacteria and be observed in the terminal lobe, which has been surgically resected.
[02:16:09.210 --> 02:16:10.191]  In your case.
[02:16:10.191 --> 02:16:15.756]  So the bypass of that is to take an injectable form of vitamin B12 once a week or so.
[02:16:15.756 --> 02:16:19.098]  Or, on our site we actually have a spray, which you just spray under your tongue.
[02:16:19.098 --> 02:16:25.304]  It's absorbed sublingually and you can bypass the expense and inconvenience of having to do it a shot every week.
[02:16:25.304 --> 02:16:26.505]  But you can't swallow it.
[02:16:26.505 --> 02:16:27.586]  It won't be absorbed.
[02:16:27.586 --> 02:16:29.667]  So that's the key.
[02:16:29.667 --> 02:16:32.269]  But will it still get into my body without an injection?
[02:16:32.269 --> 02:16:33.290]  I mean, can I use that?
[02:16:33.290 --> 02:16:36.593]  If you spray it sublingually, it will.
[02:16:36.593 --> 02:16:37.354]  Underneath your tongue.
[02:16:38.800 --> 02:16:43.086]  If it goes into your saliva glands, correct?
[02:16:43.086 --> 02:16:47.732]  Yeah, well, there's a capillary underneath your tongue that just is a direct absorption into the bloodstream.
[02:16:47.732 --> 02:16:52.058]  So you don't have to absorb it through your... Yeah, that's why folks chew tobacco.
[02:16:52.058 --> 02:16:53.661]  It's a great way to get the drug in.
[02:16:53.661 --> 02:16:54.322]  Yeah.
[02:16:55.350 --> 02:16:59.792]  Is there a way that you can put out the information, Alex, where I can get some of this or some of us who have this problem?
[02:16:59.792 --> 02:17:00.393]  Absolutely!
[02:17:00.393 --> 02:17:05.675]  I just said Mercola website.com has it.
[02:17:05.675 --> 02:17:08.076]  And there's a lot of other products out there.
[02:17:08.076 --> 02:17:10.618]  So I appreciate your call.
[02:17:10.618 --> 02:17:13.559]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Gabriel in Mass.
[02:17:13.559 --> 02:17:16.360]  Gabriel, you're on the air.
[02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:16.981]  Hello?
[02:17:16.981 --> 02:17:17.921]  Yes, sir.
[02:17:17.921 --> 02:17:18.702]  Hey, Alex.
[02:17:18.702 --> 02:17:22.403]  I want to talk about GMO.
[02:17:22.403 --> 02:17:23.304]  Soy and corn.
[02:17:23.922 --> 02:17:31.524]  About 90% of everything we buy in the stores has got... You'll have to forgive me, I'm really nervous, okay?
[02:17:31.524 --> 02:17:34.064]  We're almost out of time though, go ahead.
[02:17:34.064 --> 02:17:40.866]  About everything in the stores you buy has got genetically modified soy or corn derivatives.
[02:17:40.866 --> 02:17:45.727]  It's got pesticide resistant bacteria in it and it stays in our gut.
[02:17:45.727 --> 02:17:47.388]  Yes.
[02:17:47.388 --> 02:17:52.509]  And the animals that eat it... We eat these animals and...
[02:17:54.815 --> 02:17:55.315]  Yeah.
[02:17:55.315 --> 02:17:56.235]  Yeah, we're in deep trouble.
[02:17:56.235 --> 02:17:58.636]  I appreciate your call.
[02:17:58.636 --> 02:18:00.156]  It is incredible.
[02:18:00.156 --> 02:18:07.178]  In closing, Dr. Mercola, comment on what he was saying, and then talk more about that life extension, dealing with the DNA strands.
[02:18:07.178 --> 02:18:08.338]  Well, GMO is an issue.
[02:18:08.338 --> 02:18:14.120]  It's in over 90% of the corn and soy, so you really want to avoid those foods.
[02:18:14.120 --> 02:18:18.781]  Really, you can go to our site, we've got a, just type that in, Jeffrey Smith has put together a GMO
[02:18:20.061 --> 02:18:20.642]  We're good.
[02:18:37.887 --> 02:18:38.568]  That's a good question.
[02:18:53.440 --> 02:19:01.883]  So, there are things that can accelerate it, which is unhealthy lifestyles, just smoking, and sugar, and lack of exercise, and trans fat, and free radical exposures.
[02:19:01.883 --> 02:19:04.103]  So, that will cause you to die much earlier than 120.
[02:19:04.103 --> 02:19:09.505]  So, you want to be as healthy as you can, but even if you were the healthiest, perfectly possible lifestyle, you're still going to die at 120.
[02:19:09.505 --> 02:19:18.688]  So, the exciting research is that they've identified this enzyme that actually can be turned on, because it's not in your reproductive cells, but it's not in our body or somatic cells.
[02:19:19.168 --> 02:19:22.591]  So there's going to be these enzyme inhibitors that you'll be able to take.
[02:19:22.591 --> 02:19:27.335]  It will turn on this polymerase gene, and you'll actually be able to add calendars.
[02:19:27.335 --> 02:19:32.799]  And in research, in animals and test tubes, it actually reverses aging.
[02:19:32.799 --> 02:19:42.848]  So it's very exciting, and the take-home message is to stay as healthy as you can, because if you can do that, and you're around at 20 or 30 years, and you're still pretty healthy, you can probably have another 50 years without even blinking.
[02:19:43.528 --> 02:19:44.208]  Unbelievable.
[02:19:44.208 --> 02:19:45.289]  You know what?
[02:19:45.289 --> 02:19:51.172]  I don't want to twist your arm, but do five more minutes with us on other life extension developments.
[02:19:51.172 --> 02:19:57.094]  And they also have the diets they put rats on, as you know, that double their life expectancy.
[02:19:57.094 --> 02:19:59.015]  Let's talk about those diets when we come back.
[02:20:01.733 --> 02:20:05.096]  Forget everything you've been told about long-term food storage.
[02:20:05.096 --> 02:20:13.081]  When all hell breaks loose, you'll need the single most effective way to get high-powered Delta Force nutrients to your family, fast.
[02:20:13.081 --> 02:20:16.164]  Like any Special Forces commando, you need a plan.
[02:20:16.164 --> 02:20:18.706]  You need a Black Hawk Down food plan.
[02:20:18.706 --> 02:20:21.828]  Introducing the Survival Sprout Bank from Solutions from Science.

[02:20:56.502 --> 02:21:00.131]  Survival Sprout Bank, your Black Hawk Town emergency food plan!
[02:21:00.919 --> 02:21:05.883]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:21:05.883 --> 02:21:06.884]  What have we got?
[02:21:06.884 --> 02:21:09.326]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:21:09.326 --> 02:21:10.327]  A republic.
[02:21:10.327 --> 02:21:12.969]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:21:12.969 --> 02:21:15.231]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:21:15.231 --> 02:21:17.253]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:21:17.253 --> 02:21:18.954]  So they think they own our land?
[02:21:18.954 --> 02:21:20.276]  They think they own our water?
[02:21:20.276 --> 02:21:20.876]  Children?
[02:21:20.876 --> 02:21:21.997]  Our education?
[02:21:21.997 --> 02:21:22.818]  Our money?
[02:21:22.818 --> 02:21:26.481]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:21:26.841 --> 02:21:30.526]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:21:30.526 --> 02:21:31.808]  You are being warned.
[02:21:31.808 --> 02:21:32.829]  We have the facts.
[02:21:32.829 --> 02:21:33.991]  We have the Constitution.
[02:21:33.991 --> 02:21:34.912]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:21:34.912 --> 02:21:35.793]  We have common law.
[02:21:35.793 --> 02:21:38.317]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:21:38.317 --> 02:21:42.102]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:21:42.182 --> 02:21:47.146]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:21:47.146 --> 02:21:48.648]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:21:48.648 --> 02:21:49.729]  Don't tread on me.
[02:21:49.729 --> 02:21:56.595]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:22:00.731 --> 02:22:03.653]  Going solar for cheap is as easy as 123.
[02:22:03.653 --> 02:22:09.776]  If you want to go solar but thought the setup costs were too high, now you can build your own solar panels for less than $200.
[02:22:09.776 --> 02:22:10.537]  Don't laugh!
[02:22:10.537 --> 02:22:13.498]  We've sold over 45,000 solar do-it-yourself kits.

[02:22:30.268 --> 02:22:31.529]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:31.529 --> 02:22:36.092]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:36.092 --> 02:22:41.896]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:41.896 --> 02:22:45.538]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:45.538 --> 02:22:48.260]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:48.260 --> 02:22:53.323]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:22:53.323 --> 02:22:53.564]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:53.564 --> 02:22:54.965]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.909 --> 02:23:04.332]  The largest part of gaining radiant health is detoxification.
[02:23:04.332 --> 02:23:12.159]  You can drink ionized water, cleanse your intestines, eat a perfect diet, and even take lots of quality supplements and in many instances only make minimal progress.
[02:23:12.159 --> 02:23:16.723]  What is the key to detoxifying your body of mercury, heavy metals, chemicals, and drugs?
[02:23:16.723 --> 02:23:18.165]  It is glutathione.
[02:23:18.165 --> 02:23:22.228]  Glutathione is the master antioxidant used to detoxify your entire body.
[02:23:22.228 --> 02:23:25.612]  It stops free radicals, keeps cells young, and reduces inflammation.
[02:23:26.212 --> 02:23:31.996]  One World Whey Protein Powder may be able to raise your glutathione production by 64% or more.
[02:23:31.996 --> 02:23:39.242]  One World Whey is more effective than any other whey protein powder on the market because it is unheated and from grass-fed cows.
[02:23:39.242 --> 02:23:44.105]  All other quote cold processed whey protein powders have been heated and damaged by 15% or more.
[02:23:45.686 --> 02:23:48.068]  One World Way comes in three delicious flavors.
[02:23:48.068 --> 02:23:50.209]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:23:50.209 --> 02:23:54.051]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:23:54.051 --> 02:23:56.133]  Or visit oneworldway.com.
[02:23:56.133 --> 02:24:09.881]  That's oneworld, W-H-E-Y, dot com.
[02:24:09.881 --> 02:24:13.604]  In my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement,
[02:24:14.657 --> 02:24:37.711]  I show you world leaders, top scientists, futurists, Ray Kurzweil, Bill Joy, all talking about how there's six and a half billion people, how they cannot give us the life extension, and that's why a world government has to be formed to basically reduce our population so the elite can inherit the earth and get the life extension.
[02:24:38.531 --> 02:24:52.642]  And again, I just read the mainstream medical literature where they're increasing the life of certain types of insects three, four times, where they're doubling the life expectancy of rodents just with diet.
[02:24:52.642 --> 02:24:55.764]  And this literature has been out for a long time.
[02:24:55.764 --> 02:24:59.327]  A lot of the diets are basically high nutrient, but near starvation.
[02:24:59.327 --> 02:25:06.773]  Dr. Mercola, can you comment on not just the lengthening of the DNA strands, but some of the other studies that are out there?
[02:25:07.580 --> 02:25:09.922]  Well, the most common approach is calorie restriction.
[02:25:09.922 --> 02:25:17.067]  I'm not a big fan of that because it's really very difficult to do and it's logistically impractical.
[02:25:17.067 --> 02:25:21.110]  But most of the studies used that as an approach.
[02:25:21.110 --> 02:25:23.972]  My approach is really to optimize insulin.
[02:25:23.972 --> 02:25:31.437]  So, it's very clear from my review of the literature that that's probably the single most important way to optimize aging.
[02:25:32.438 --> 02:25:32.918]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:25:53.126 --> 02:25:57.469]  The other important element is to exercise and there's a lot of confusion about exercise.
[02:25:57.469 --> 02:26:04.214]  I started exercise in 1968 and was a long distance runner for over 40 years and unfortunately that is not the best type.
[02:26:04.214 --> 02:26:07.837]  So your typical cardio, which you see 90% of people doing when you go to a fitness club,
[02:26:08.697 --> 02:26:09.378]  I think so.
[02:26:28.986 --> 02:26:31.808]  So it's almost like a power lifting explosive?
[02:26:31.808 --> 02:26:33.229]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:26:33.229 --> 02:26:35.490]  We have a term for it called PEAK8.
[02:26:35.490 --> 02:26:38.032]  If you go to my website, type it in.
[02:26:38.032 --> 02:26:41.113]  I've got videos and really, you know, there's no cost to it.
[02:26:41.113 --> 02:26:45.116]  I mean, for the information, it just tells you how to do it really specifically and measure your heart rate.
[02:26:45.576 --> 02:26:46.998]  Well, I kinda got into weightlifting from about 17 to 22.
[02:27:00.333 --> 02:27:01.094]  We're good to go.
[02:27:29.253 --> 02:27:31.035]  Yeah, that's more of a high-intensity thing.
[02:27:31.035 --> 02:27:32.736]  That's actually more of an ideal type exercise.
[02:27:32.736 --> 02:27:35.858]  Strength training is absolutely an essential component of a good exercise program.
[02:27:35.858 --> 02:27:40.902]  You know, it should be about 50% strength training, 50% of it's high-intensity, and some good stretching in there.
[02:27:40.902 --> 02:27:47.607]  But, you know, you do that, and not only will you help optimize your ability to live a long and healthy life, but the quality of life will be good.
[02:27:47.607 --> 02:27:52.831]  You won't be crippled in debility, because 80% of Americans have problems with their joints.
[02:27:53.371 --> 02:27:55.873]  Arthritis, pain, there's no reason for that.
[02:27:55.873 --> 02:27:58.155]  You don't have to suffer with that type of pain.
[02:27:58.155 --> 02:28:02.218]  It's needless if you follow a healthy lifestyle.
[02:28:02.218 --> 02:28:02.758]  Amazing.
[02:28:02.758 --> 02:28:12.165]  Well, Dr. Mercola, we had you on many years ago, and it seems like a decade passes, and I know you've been a busy guy, but it's great to have you back with us.
[02:28:12.165 --> 02:28:16.068]  And there's so much at Mercola website, mercola.com, M-E-R-C-O-L-A.
[02:28:18.730 --> 02:28:22.855]  C-O-L-A, obviously your last name, Dr. Joseph Mercola.
[02:28:22.855 --> 02:28:26.639]  I look forward to having you back up as things develop with quick pop-ins.
[02:28:26.639 --> 02:28:27.160]  Sure.
[02:28:27.160 --> 02:28:28.982]  And thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:28:28.982 --> 02:28:32.586]  Well, thanks for having me, Alex, and a great opportunity to talk to you and your listeners.
[02:28:32.586 --> 02:28:32.886]  You bet.
[02:28:32.886 --> 02:28:33.187]  Be well.
[02:28:33.507 --> 02:28:34.307]  God bless you.
[02:28:34.307 --> 02:28:35.707]  What an amazing interview.
[02:28:35.707 --> 02:28:38.728]  What incredible information.
[02:28:38.728 --> 02:28:44.969]  Again, we are starting to really win some battles, but we need to win the war here against the globalists.
[02:28:44.969 --> 02:28:45.870]  I'm going to come back.
[02:28:45.870 --> 02:28:47.510]  I'm going to collect my thoughts during the break.
[02:28:47.510 --> 02:28:55.992]  I'm going to come back and go through WikiLeaks, TSA, police state, economic news in the final 30 minutes of this hour.
[02:28:57.228 --> 02:29:02.070]  I do want to just remind folks that we are listener supported.
[02:29:02.070 --> 02:29:13.534]  My 29 or 30 employees and contractors, the websites, the bandwidth, the films, the flying around the country and the world to interview people, that is all financed by your support.
[02:29:13.534 --> 02:29:20.197]  So you get materials when you buy books and t-shirts and videos that wake people up and spread the message, but you also support
[02:29:21.243 --> 02:29:25.945]  this platform for expanding knowledge throughout the planet.
[02:29:25.945 --> 02:29:28.967]  And it's so wonderful and we couldn't do it without you.

[02:30:23.006 --> 02:30:26.829]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[02:30:29.532 --> 02:30:35.059]  I'm looking for America.

[02:33:23.748 --> 02:33:24.788]  We are back live.
[02:33:24.788 --> 02:33:26.048]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:33:26.048 --> 02:33:27.889]  It is Wednesday, the 8th day.
[02:33:32.546 --> 02:33:33.348]  of December 2010.
[02:33:33.348 --> 02:33:38.177]  Now, I said that coming up in this hour I would get into
[02:33:39.724 --> 02:33:52.389]  The situation with Jesse Ventura's TV show, now that some of it has come out in the news, I can talk about it without violating the confidence that I've been brought into with people.
[02:33:52.389 --> 02:33:55.270]  Of course, I can't tell you the full story, but I can tell you part of it.
[02:33:55.270 --> 02:33:57.031]  I talked to the governor this morning.
[02:33:57.031 --> 02:34:00.673]  He is going to be coming on next week, probably Tuesday or Wednesday.
[02:34:00.673 --> 02:34:05.675]  He's not doing any other media, but he's going to talk about a host of issues here next week.
[02:34:06.761 --> 02:34:14.365]  So let me go ahead and cover that briefly, and then I'll get into WikiLeaks and the economy and some other important issues with the TSA.
[02:34:14.365 --> 02:34:17.026]  A huge new development on that front.
[02:34:17.026 --> 02:34:31.113]  But before I go any further, they've had a lot of dirty tricks run against the producers of the last year's 8-part series, but especially this year.
[02:34:32.714 --> 02:34:40.883]  And they've, again, they don't want me to get into a lot of it because they're trying to gauge it and figure out what they're going to do.
[02:34:40.883 --> 02:34:48.430]  But the Police State episode, they would have normally aired it five or six more times in the last three weeks since it aired November 12th.
[02:34:50.538 --> 02:34:51.458]  But it hasn't aired.
[02:34:51.458 --> 02:34:58.862]  All the other episodes have aired over and over again in marathons, because it's one of the most popular shows on True TV.
[02:34:58.862 --> 02:35:08.747]  Now, the episodes cost over $200,000 a piece to produce, and again, they've shelved the Police State FEMA Camp Special.
[02:35:10.264 --> 02:35:20.972]  Which is very well documented with the Threat Fusion Centers, the Rex 84, the admission that the government is preparing for civil unrest.
[02:35:20.972 --> 02:35:26.316]  I mean, that's all over the news now, that they want to use the military for civil unrest.
[02:35:26.316 --> 02:35:34.662]  And the bill was introduced and co-sponsored by Representative Steve Cohen and others that Ventura went and interviewed.
[02:35:35.622 --> 02:35:42.125]  And Cohen makes a fool out of himself at the end of the show and says, oh, you believe in little green men and machines from Mars.
[02:35:42.125 --> 02:35:43.845]  And Ventura says, well, here's the bill.
[02:35:43.845 --> 02:35:47.527]  And he goes, oh, I remember that now.
[02:35:47.527 --> 02:35:48.627]  It's for emergencies.
[02:35:48.627 --> 02:35:53.109]  But Ventura goes, well, it says for whatever reasons Homeland Security deems fit.
[02:35:53.109 --> 02:35:56.870]  And in the context of that hour-long show, this was groundbreaking.
[02:35:56.870 --> 02:36:00.751]  I mean, it really shows you how they're rolling the camps out.
[02:36:00.751 --> 02:36:01.912]  And Cohen
[02:36:03.300 --> 02:36:05.121]  sent letters to Time Warner.
[02:36:05.121 --> 02:36:09.504]  He sent letters to the subdivision, True TV.
[02:36:09.504 --> 02:36:22.012]  He sicked the ADL behind the scenes three weeks ago on them with, well, I'm just going to leave it at that.
[02:36:22.012 --> 02:36:23.033]  There was other pressure
[02:36:25.080 --> 02:36:28.945]  from government quarters, but I'm not at liberty to get into all of that.
[02:36:28.945 --> 02:36:31.067]  I can talk about the congressman now.
[02:36:31.067 --> 02:36:36.995]  You know, some fools on the internet are like, oh, they probably pulled this show to hype it.
[02:36:36.995 --> 02:36:38.677]  Oh yeah, that's exactly what they want to do.
[02:36:38.677 --> 02:36:41.901]  They pay for a show, it gets top ratings, and then they never air it again.
[02:36:43.547 --> 02:36:45.227]  No, that's not what's going on.
[02:36:45.227 --> 02:36:48.028]  And so now, there needs to be public pressure on this.
[02:36:48.028 --> 02:36:51.369]  For two, three weeks, people have noticed that it's not airing.
[02:36:51.369 --> 02:36:58.330]  If you go look at the code on the Conspiracy Theory website on TruTV, you can still see where the episode is there with the text and the video clips.
[02:36:58.330 --> 02:36:59.571]  It's just hidden.
[02:36:59.571 --> 02:37:02.531]  Somebody's being a little bit sloppy over there.
[02:37:02.531 --> 02:37:12.734]  But now, because Cohen yesterday, on December 7th, put out a op-ed piece in The Hill newspaper, a roll call,
[02:37:14.740 --> 02:37:34.634]  The official paper that serves Congress and Capitol Hill and he calls Ventura a liar in here But doesn't give any evidence and you know I can tell you he's scared because he looked like a deer in the headlights and looked foolish In that piece by saying oh, they're happy children, and you know all of this and then saying well That's not a FEMA camp.
[02:37:34.634 --> 02:37:35.995]  That's a place for immigrants
[02:37:36.115 --> 02:37:45.391]  Well, we say that in the piece and show the Rex 84 that they admit, and the Houston Chronicle, that these FEMA camp contracts are for illegals but also for citizens.
[02:37:45.391 --> 02:37:46.493]  And then we show the bill!
[02:37:47.817 --> 02:37:52.139]  And we show these designated sectors to expand the camps.
[02:37:52.139 --> 02:37:57.681]  I mean, it's spot on, it's hardcore, and he doesn't get into any specifics in this article.
[02:37:57.681 --> 02:38:00.522]  He just says how dangerous it is to have this type of media.
[02:38:00.522 --> 02:38:07.185]  He's a big ADL, Southern Primary Law Center type guy, always out there pushing hate laws and things to restrict free speech.
[02:38:07.185 --> 02:38:14.448]  And you see this big push by the FCC commissioner, the Commissar, to restrict free speech and openly announcing it.
[02:38:14.448 --> 02:38:15.949]  And you see Lieberman bragging
[02:38:16.929 --> 02:38:25.933]  That he called Amazon.com and told them to shut down Wikileaks' link on their site where they were selling some products.
[02:38:25.933 --> 02:38:27.354]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[02:38:27.354 --> 02:38:30.735]  I guess they had their servers with Amazon.com.
[02:38:30.735 --> 02:38:42.541]  So, really scary that this is going on and Representative Steve Cohen calling Ventura a liar in here really makes me angry because I did a lot of the research for the piece.
[02:38:42.541 --> 02:38:43.381]  It's spot on and
[02:38:47.270 --> 02:38:52.255]  It's incredible that he would try to deny the bill existed and laugh at Ventura and say, oh, space aliens.
[02:38:52.255 --> 02:38:58.480]  And then Ventura gives him the bill and he goes, oh, I do remember that now.
[02:38:58.480 --> 02:39:03.365]  Oh, I mean, it's the biggest Perry Mason moment.
[02:39:03.365 --> 02:39:12.212]  If this this guy looks like Sylvester caught with Tweety Bird in his mouth with feathers sticking out is the only way to describe it.
[02:39:13.184 --> 02:39:14.045]  And you can't make this up.
[02:39:35.552 --> 02:39:35.892]  All right.
[02:39:56.580 --> 02:39:58.502]  It's in Police State 4, Rise of FEMA.
[02:39:58.502 --> 02:40:00.083]  Well, that film is so important.
[02:40:00.083 --> 02:40:06.428]  We have the state rep on, the governor's in the news saying, we've got Homeland Security military checkpoints searching everybody.
[02:40:06.428 --> 02:40:07.188]  This is illegal.
[02:40:07.188 --> 02:40:07.849]  Stop it.
[02:40:07.849 --> 02:40:10.411]  And Homeland Security said, we don't care and did it.
[02:40:10.411 --> 02:40:14.274]  You've got a huge takeover of our society and nobody can deny it.
[02:40:14.274 --> 02:40:18.617]  And Ventura powerfully at the end of that piece says, they said it couldn't happen here.
[02:40:18.617 --> 02:40:21.419]  Well, it already has.
[02:40:21.419 --> 02:40:23.761]  Look, it's real.
[02:40:23.761 --> 02:40:25.823]  And that episode was powerful.
[02:40:27.048 --> 02:40:28.490]  So is the JFK one.
[02:40:28.490 --> 02:40:34.035]  And, you know, Cohen is just amazing.
[02:40:34.035 --> 02:40:37.418]  I mean, he behind the scenes puts pressure along with others.
[02:40:37.418 --> 02:40:40.862]  It gets pulled and then people notice it's happened.
[02:40:40.862 --> 02:40:42.283]  No doubt he's gotten more heat.
[02:40:42.283 --> 02:40:46.948]  So he runs around on this crusade now in the article.
[02:40:46.948 --> 02:40:49.731]  Cohen, we must hold the media accountable.
[02:40:51.877 --> 02:40:58.319]  I bet you didn't mind the media telling us there were WMDs in Iraq or that we've got to take the H1N1 shot.
[02:40:58.319 --> 02:40:59.679]  It's just incredible.
[02:40:59.679 --> 02:41:02.640]  And it's in the Commercial Appeal, it's in a bunch of other newspapers.
[02:41:02.640 --> 02:41:07.342]  Representative Steve Cohen goes to the mat with TV's Ventura over conspiracy theory.
[02:41:14.451 --> 02:41:21.283]  Time Warner's response was, we believe most viewers accept conspiracy theory for what it is, a series that expresses different views on conspiracies.
[02:41:24.687 --> 02:41:29.509]  You know, and they put that conspiracy name on it so they can say, well, we're just looking at conspiracies.
[02:41:29.509 --> 02:41:35.132]  Look, their last episode confirms there's uranium and fluoride being put in the water.
[02:41:35.132 --> 02:41:41.875]  I mean, you see half the women with their hair falling out, people getting Alzheimer's at 25, cancer exploding.
[02:41:41.875 --> 02:41:45.397]  They estimate by 2020, half the population is going to have diabetes.
[02:41:45.397 --> 02:41:47.418]  This isn't funny, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:41:48.208 --> 02:41:58.157]  And I don't know if Cohen is fully aware of what that bill would really do, but he certainly was caught red-handed trying to deny it.
[02:41:58.157 --> 02:42:14.711]  And so he's freaked out, he's angry, and now in America, you need to know that if you're not MSNBC and totally paid off by bailout money, and you're true TV, you just get the government coming down on you, so television programs go off the air, while we have this backdrop
[02:42:15.231 --> 02:42:21.739]  Of all these people in Congress, Jay Rockefeller and the others, running around openly saying, shut down the alternative media.
[02:42:21.739 --> 02:42:23.841]  Nobody should be able to criticize the government.
[02:42:23.841 --> 02:42:25.243]  I mean, he talks about it in here.
[02:42:25.243 --> 02:42:28.527]  Oh, the media shouldn't be, you know, creating fear of the government.
[02:42:28.527 --> 02:42:31.290]  Heaven forbid we act like George Washington.
[02:42:32.885 --> 02:42:43.941]  The FCC Commissioner comes out and says the freedom we've had in the media is an aberration, and the government's got to decide what can go on air.
[02:42:43.941 --> 02:42:45.303]  This is Pravda.
[02:42:45.303 --> 02:42:47.746]  This is the Soviet Union, if they have their way.
[02:42:48.767 --> 02:42:50.708]  I am proud of that episode.
[02:42:50.708 --> 02:42:52.589]  I'm proud of the global warming episode.
[02:42:52.589 --> 02:42:55.431]  I'm proud of the population reduction episode from last season.
[02:42:55.431 --> 02:42:57.212]  I'm proud of being in that water episode.
[02:42:57.212 --> 02:42:58.973]  It's all true.
[02:42:58.973 --> 02:43:01.354]  They have to fact-check every bit of that.
[02:43:01.354 --> 02:43:07.258]  They've had a few episodes about mind control, because, I mean, that's admitted, but then they go off into things they can't prove.
[02:43:09.906 --> 02:43:15.612]  You know, the network decides, hey, you're doing a show about Plum Island and bioweapons labs all over the country.
[02:43:15.612 --> 02:43:18.115]  Locals think, you know, weird animals are floating up.
[02:43:18.115 --> 02:43:19.556]  Add that into it, you know.
[02:43:19.556 --> 02:43:26.584]  I mean, there's a few things that are sensationalistic, just because I think some of the people involved in the show are just trying to learn and understand it.
[02:43:26.584 --> 02:43:27.285]  But I'll tell you.
[02:43:27.765 --> 02:43:46.374]  You know, the water episode, the JFK, the FEMA, the global warming, the population reduction, the BP special, the oil spill special coming up tomorrow night, or two nights from now, Friday night, the Pentagon strike coming out, that's the last episode, next week.
[02:43:46.374 --> 02:43:48.716]  I mean, who knows if that'll even make it to air.
[02:43:48.716 --> 02:43:52.257]  So, here it is.
[02:43:52.257 --> 02:43:53.238]  And you really read this.
[02:44:03.755 --> 02:44:09.717]  And he doesn't ever really get into the fact that he put pressure on them from behind the scenes.
[02:44:09.717 --> 02:44:17.459]  He goes on to say, TBS and Tom Warner have a moral and civic responsibility not to disseminate information they know to be false.
[02:44:17.459 --> 02:44:19.000]  They know to be false.
[02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:25.282]  He just makes declaratory statements, particularly when it is dressed up to appear as an investigative reporting.
[02:44:26.198 --> 02:44:31.722]  Should someone get hurt, as a result of this unsubstantiated programming, the media will be undeniably held responsible.
[02:44:41.544 --> 02:44:43.405]  Can you imagine what else went on behind the scenes?
[02:44:43.405 --> 02:44:43.866]  So, this guy
[02:45:09.952 --> 02:45:12.294]  These people are so dangerous.
[02:45:12.294 --> 02:45:21.780]  I mean, they just openly don't want us to talk about all the urban warfare drills, the threat fusion centers admittedly grabbing all our credit card data in real time, committing crimes.
[02:45:21.780 --> 02:45:28.304]  The MIAC Homeland Security reports, 95% of it, Janet Napolitano admits this, is focused on the American people.
[02:45:28.304 --> 02:45:30.605]  I mean, this is a bait and a switch, folks.
[02:45:30.605 --> 02:45:32.567]  And they're taking this country over.
[02:45:32.567 --> 02:45:35.389]  They're putting telescreens up in the stores saying, spy on your neighbors.
[02:45:36.149 --> 02:45:39.491]  They're taking over our society and they want us to go along with it.
[02:45:39.491 --> 02:45:41.372]  We have got to say no.
[02:45:41.372 --> 02:45:51.139]  And people have got to stand up against people like this congressman and the ADL and others that are trying to restrict free speech in this country.
[02:45:51.139 --> 02:45:53.000]  It's un-American and it's dangerous.
[02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:58.543]  You know, if Mr. Cohen has got proof something is inaccurate, why doesn't he talk about it?
[02:45:58.543 --> 02:46:00.584]  He just makes these big statements.
[02:46:00.584 --> 02:46:01.585]  And you know what, pal?
[02:46:01.585 --> 02:46:02.526]  You're a public figure.
[02:46:03.166 --> 02:46:08.868]  You introduced a bill for the establishment of emergency FEMA camps in this country.
[02:46:08.868 --> 02:46:10.989]  And it says, for whatever purposes you wish.
[02:46:10.989 --> 02:46:15.690]  And then we've been to those bases where they do drills of arresting Americans.
[02:46:15.690 --> 02:46:19.932]  So don't give me that baloney!
[02:46:19.932 --> 02:46:20.432]  It is so...
[02:46:21.701 --> 02:46:26.622]  It's frustrating to be informed and to know this guy is counting on people not being informed.
[02:46:26.622 --> 02:46:29.983]  You know, in the piece they even say, oh, Cohen probably didn't even read the bill.
[02:46:29.983 --> 02:46:32.464]  You know, they get lots of bills from lobbyists.
[02:46:32.464 --> 02:46:34.744]  They even try to give the guy a way out.
[02:46:34.744 --> 02:46:37.705]  Like, oh, he didn't know what he was doing.
[02:46:37.705 --> 02:46:40.825]  Well, what does this look like right here?
[02:46:40.825 --> 02:46:43.386]  I mean, is that not tyranny?
[02:46:43.386 --> 02:46:46.927]  Saying, oh, if something bad happens, it's going to be your fault.
[02:46:50.154 --> 02:46:51.676]  That's what political correctness is.
[02:46:51.676 --> 02:46:54.479]  That's why they say, oh, you can't criticize a group.
[02:46:54.479 --> 02:46:56.962]  You can't read Bible verses in Canada.
[02:46:56.962 --> 02:47:02.729]  They arrest preachers up there that criticize a group because somebody might hear it and do something violent.
[02:47:02.729 --> 02:47:08.236]  Meanwhile, the state is gearing up for war against the people and engaged in all sorts of violence against us.
[02:47:08.236 --> 02:47:09.478]  Let me blitz through other news now.
[02:47:11.977 --> 02:47:15.382]  Hackers strike back to support WikiLeaks founder.
[02:47:15.382 --> 02:47:22.514]  WikiLeaks supporters struck back Wednesday at perceived enemies of the site and its jailed founder, Assange.
[02:47:24.329 --> 02:47:33.636]  Launching hacker attacks against MasterCard, Swedish prosecutors, a Swedish lawyer, and a Swiss group that froze Assange's bank account.
[02:47:33.636 --> 02:47:44.824]  The so-called hacktivists, operating under the label Operation Payback, claimed responsibility in a Twitter message for causing technical problems at MasterCard, which pulled the plug on their relationship with Wikileaks on Tuesday.
[02:47:46.142 --> 02:47:47.304]  It's a denial of service attack.
[02:47:47.304 --> 02:47:49.065]  It looks like they're experiencing heavy traffic.
[02:47:49.065 --> 02:47:56.012]  Spokesman James Issa told the Associated Press the company would not confirm whether WikiLeaks was involved.
[02:47:56.012 --> 02:47:57.814]  And it goes on through other things being attacked.
[02:47:59.981 --> 02:48:06.284]  The problem is that they've now introduced bills to basically shut down internet freedom in the name of WikiLeaks.
[02:48:06.284 --> 02:48:08.425]  It's the Internet's 9-11.
[02:48:08.425 --> 02:48:10.046]  And of course, it's an inside job.
[02:48:10.046 --> 02:48:22.713]  And Assange has been fed this stuff by high-level people, the right-hand man of George Soros, the Open Society Organization, the CFR former president, Leslie Gelb, and others.
[02:48:23.772 --> 02:48:23.852]  No.
[02:48:39.107 --> 02:48:39.827]  What's the exact term?
[02:48:39.827 --> 02:48:40.868]  I've got it here in the article.
[02:48:40.868 --> 02:48:43.889]  They call it, uh, sudden sex.
[02:48:43.889 --> 02:48:45.970]  Uh, or that it's surprise sex.
[02:48:45.970 --> 02:48:47.330]  That's the technical term.
[02:48:47.330 --> 02:48:52.132]  Where, oh, the woman got excited, and but she didn't really mean it, so you go to jail.
[02:48:52.132 --> 02:48:54.053]  And they teach in all the colleges, any sex
[02:48:54.893 --> 02:48:56.274]  With your wife it's rape.
[02:48:56.274 --> 02:48:57.854]  Men are inherently evil.
[02:48:57.854 --> 02:49:01.836]  That's just to divide women so they can be cornered by the government by themselves.
[02:49:01.836 --> 02:49:03.697]  So women don't have families that are strong.
[02:49:03.697 --> 02:49:05.478]  So they can deprive you of true humanity.
[02:49:05.478 --> 02:49:07.098]  And look at how screwed up society is.
[02:49:07.098 --> 02:49:08.059]  That's the goal.
[02:49:08.059 --> 02:49:10.180]  They've got to destroy it to then take it over.
[02:49:11.474 --> 02:49:14.156]  Assange could face espionage trial in the U.S.
[02:49:14.156 --> 02:49:18.839]  Now they've got him for having sex with women who agreed to it.
[02:49:18.839 --> 02:49:20.600]  Now the U.S.
[02:49:20.600 --> 02:49:24.863]  government's talking about espionage charges against him.
[02:49:24.863 --> 02:49:28.806]  Yeah, you order troops to torture children in Iraq, that's okay.
[02:49:28.806 --> 02:49:33.289]  Or banks can steal trillions, but you do this, you're going to get an espionage charge.
[02:49:33.289 --> 02:49:35.371]  So they can set the precedent that anybody
[02:49:35.831 --> 02:49:38.372]  Reports on corruption, you get an espionage charge.
[02:49:38.372 --> 02:49:42.313]  See, they want this criminal state's secrets kept secret.
[02:49:42.313 --> 02:49:44.694]  Leaks brought out the atomic soldiers.
[02:49:44.694 --> 02:49:48.275]  Leaks brought out Project Shad, the government nerve-gassing our own troops.
[02:49:48.275 --> 02:49:56.398]  Leaks brought out our government injecting children, claiming it's vaccines with polio and other degenerative diseases and killing them, like syphilis.
[02:49:56.398 --> 02:49:58.199]  See, they don't want that coming out.
[02:49:58.199 --> 02:50:04.341]  They want you to, the government loves us and big sisters on big telescreens and jumbotrons telling us everything.
[02:50:06.527 --> 02:50:07.449]  So, continuing...
[02:50:09.261 --> 02:50:12.463]  This is very, very dangerous, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:50:12.463 --> 02:50:17.246]  And a lot of people are striking back and saying no.
[02:50:17.246 --> 02:50:21.609]  And they're calling this the first official info war between the people and the system.
[02:50:21.609 --> 02:50:23.751]  The Daily News calls it hero or terrorist.
[02:50:23.751 --> 02:50:28.214]  The Assange effect represents a real grassroots internet rebellion.
[02:50:28.214 --> 02:50:30.015]  No doubt about that.
[02:50:30.015 --> 02:50:32.897]  And the answer is more leaks on every front.
[02:50:32.897 --> 02:50:33.257]  Okay?
[02:50:33.257 --> 02:50:36.119]  The government operates in secrecy as a pack of crooks.
[02:50:38.047 --> 02:50:44.331]  Continuing here, the government's talking about prosecuting the New York Times and others.
[02:50:44.331 --> 02:50:49.994]  I want to go over some more of the heavy hitters that are involved in all of this.
[02:50:49.994 --> 02:50:57.858]  Assange is also saying in an op-ed he got out before he got arrested, that to take down WikiLeaks, you've got to take down the whole internet.
[02:50:57.858 --> 02:51:00.200]  I think that may be what the globalists are thinking about doing.
[02:51:01.559 --> 02:51:05.620]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:05.620 --> 02:51:10.141]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:51:10.141 --> 02:51:16.282]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:51:16.282 --> 02:51:18.723]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:51:18.723 --> 02:51:24.684]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:24.824 --> 02:51:28.229]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:51:28.229 --> 02:51:30.091]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:51:30.091 --> 02:51:32.294]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[02:51:32.294 --> 02:51:37.160]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[02:51:37.160 --> 02:51:37.981]  Guaranteed.
[02:51:37.981 --> 02:51:42.027]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[02:51:42.267 --> 02:51:50.311]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.
[02:51:50.311 --> 02:51:51.031]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[02:51:51.031 --> 02:51:51.871]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[02:52:01.010 --> 02:52:03.392]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:03.392 --> 02:52:05.595]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:05.595 --> 02:52:08.918]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:08.918 --> 02:52:14.043]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:14.043 --> 02:52:18.227]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.527 --> 02:52:20.888]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:20.888 --> 02:52:23.769]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:23.769 --> 02:52:26.691]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:26.691 --> 02:52:34.274]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.628 --> 02:52:40.013]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:40.013 --> 02:52:42.875]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:42.875 --> 02:52:46.558]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:46.558 --> 02:52:47.619]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:47.619 --> 02:52:48.960]  You're everyone else.
[02:52:48.960 --> 02:52:50.461]  Invisible Empire.

[02:53:03.923 --> 02:53:09.625]  You've heard me talk about the delicious, easy-to-fix, and very storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:53:09.625 --> 02:53:14.387]  I've told you for years that eFoodsDirect has the best storable food on the planet.
[02:53:14.387 --> 02:53:18.128]  Now it's that time of year again, and their holiday special is here.
[02:53:18.128 --> 02:53:25.071]  They have two holiday price packs for you to put into your reserves for a secure future or to share with others.
[02:53:25.071 --> 02:53:27.872]  The first is a 6-month bulk supply in 10 cans.
[02:53:28.812 --> 02:53:36.355]  And the second is a five-week supply of quick and easy-to-fix meals, including delicious bakery items shipped in heavy tote bags.
[02:53:36.355 --> 02:53:43.418]  Now, for a limited time, when you order two or more of these special holiday packs, you'll get free shipping on your entire order.
[02:53:43.418 --> 02:53:47.640]  Call now, 800-409-5633, or visit them at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:53:47.640 --> 02:53:50.041]  That's 800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:54:09.915 --> 02:54:20.624]  Here's the headline, WikiLeaks spokesman, only way to stop whistleblowers is to shut down the web.
[02:54:36.550 --> 02:54:45.058]  Well, they've got legislation to make you have IDs when you're online, to charge you with espionage if you basically leak any type of corruption of any government.
[02:54:45.058 --> 02:54:48.320]  I mean, it's just criminals trying to protect themselves.
[02:54:48.320 --> 02:54:49.361]  It's totally disgusting.
[02:54:49.361 --> 02:54:50.903]  They're not trying to protect us, folks.
[02:54:50.903 --> 02:54:53.705]  They're trying to protect the fact they're running the terrorist.
[02:54:53.705 --> 02:54:56.728]  They've been caught over and over again shipping the drugs in, running the terrorist.
[02:54:58.268 --> 02:55:07.491]  I mean, you've got to understand that we've got a bunch of psychopathic criminals running things, and nobody is safe until we wake up and face that!
[02:55:07.491 --> 02:55:27.798]  That means you, a cop on a power trip, who is still gullible enough to believe that we're still in Kansas, or a school teacher that's gullible, or a doctor, or a talk show host, any of you, if you don't know that things are in deep, deep decline, and that tyranny's growing, you are brain dead.
[02:55:31.121 --> 02:55:34.765]  And there's not time to suck our thumbs and be compliant cowards anymore.
[02:55:34.765 --> 02:55:38.609]  If you've noticed, I've turned the heat up and gotten more bold.
[02:55:38.609 --> 02:55:40.030]  These people are out of control!
[02:55:40.030 --> 02:55:40.090]  Now...
[02:55:43.484 --> 02:55:52.666]  Chinese dissidents that are known CIA connected started WikiLeaks in 2006 and this is reported on by Cass Sunstein.
[02:55:52.666 --> 02:56:01.448]  The White House regulations are openly calls for infiltrating the internet, running false flags on the web to shut down free speech, and arresting people that criticize the government.
[02:56:01.448 --> 02:56:02.568]  That's on record.
[02:56:02.568 --> 02:56:09.910]  Cass Sunstein, acolyte of George Soros, minion of George Soros, is on record in the
[02:56:14.666 --> 02:56:19.956]  2007, Op-Ed PC wrote, introducing WikiLeaks to the world.
[02:56:19.956 --> 02:56:21.880]  We've got Morten Halperin.
[02:56:23.024 --> 02:56:23.304]  of course.
[02:56:45.996 --> 02:56:46.736]  I don't know.
[02:57:12.469 --> 02:57:12.769]  I think?
[02:57:26.874 --> 02:57:29.696]  But, regardless, Assange has been set up.
[02:57:29.696 --> 02:57:35.781]  You gotta get Lee Harvey Oswald, you know, 2010, the patsy, out of jail.
[02:57:35.781 --> 02:57:41.766]  Because they're gonna make it all about the spectacle of his trial for having consensual sex.
[02:57:41.766 --> 02:57:43.307]  That's the new thought crime.
[02:57:43.307 --> 02:57:48.271]  But they can't keep him long for that, so now they're talking about espionage or financial stuff.
[02:57:48.271 --> 02:57:49.552]  They're coming after him.
[02:57:49.552 --> 02:57:52.214]  And if they can get him, they can get anybody.
[02:57:52.214 --> 02:57:53.695]  You understand that?
[02:57:53.695 --> 02:57:54.376]  This is tyranny.
[02:57:55.714 --> 02:57:59.116]  Now continuing, I meant to get into this more, but this is big news.
[02:57:59.116 --> 02:58:00.316]  We gotta get this out to everybody.
[02:58:00.316 --> 02:58:05.379]  This is a key break in the fight against the TSA and the federal takeover of society.
[02:58:05.379 --> 02:58:13.722]  TSA agents complain over body scanner radiation exposure and a cover-up of the radiation readings in federal studies.
[02:58:13.722 --> 02:58:15.723]  That's also on USA Today.
[02:58:15.723 --> 02:58:19.725]  Get this article out to everybody you know in this fight.
[02:58:19.725 --> 02:58:20.926]  This is so important.
[02:58:24.457 --> 02:58:26.960]  It is so important to get this information out.
[02:58:26.960 --> 02:58:30.684]  TSA agents complain over body scanner, radiation.
[02:58:30.684 --> 02:58:32.366]  It's got all the intel there.
[02:58:32.366 --> 02:58:34.188]  Get this to TSA workers you know.
[02:58:34.188 --> 02:58:35.209]  Go to the airport.
[02:58:35.209 --> 02:58:36.410]  Hand it out to them.
[02:58:36.410 --> 02:58:40.054]  Because if they can't get their enforcers to kill themselves, we can get liberty.
