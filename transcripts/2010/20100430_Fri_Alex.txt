[00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:05.090]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:06.791]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.531 --> 00:00:08.651]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.291 --> 00:00:10.112]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.872 --> 00:00:11.812]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:16.053]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.613 --> 00:00:20.714]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.495 --> 00:00:24.495]  We have reached the halfway point in this Friday edition.
[00:00:24.515 --> 00:00:26.696]  For the next 60 minutes, James Traficant.
[00:00:27.276 --> 00:00:41.902]  Here is our guest, the iconic, beam me up, Scotty, there's no intelligent life here, Congressman, who was absolutely railroaded into prison, there is no doubt about that, for exposing corruption and tyranny in this nation.
[00:00:42.682 --> 00:00:59.789]  And he's going to discuss the Tea Parties, he's running for the Congress again, we're going to get his take on the militarization of police, what really happened in Oklahoma City, he investigated that, what happened with the Pan Am flight, and a lot more, and we'll take some phone calls, because I did have the phones open earlier for military and police to call in.
[00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:08.032]  We have all these government documents where they're training the military for martial law in America, and it's building towards a crescendo.
[00:01:08.332 --> 00:01:10.073]  James Traficant, good to have you on with us, sir.
[00:01:10.433 --> 00:01:11.554]  Glad to be back, Alex.
[00:01:11.634 --> 00:01:18.760]  And I want to say after appearing on your show several months ago, I didn't realize how strong a show you have.
[00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.044]  And I want to commend you because you are educating millions of American people.
[00:01:23.585 --> 00:01:27.488]  I was surprised and I'm honored to be asked to come back on your show.
[00:01:27.668 --> 00:01:31.191]  Well, Congressman, we're honored to have you here because of your courage and your steadfastness.
[00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:33.393]  So much is happening, so much is going on.
[00:01:33.433 --> 00:01:46.663]  I've got questions and issues I want to pick your brain about, but out of the gates, the state of the union, the state of the taxing system, all the new VAT taxes they want, telling us austerity, taxes are going to go up, our benefits are going to go down.
[00:01:47.004 --> 00:01:48.605]  What does James Travacant say about that?
[00:01:48.965 --> 00:01:50.809]  Well, number one, I think the country is bankrupt.
[00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:51.590]  That's evident.
[00:01:51.991 --> 00:01:56.679]  And number two, I think all they're talking about doing is just going to further implode this nation.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.464]  And I see us dismantling like the old Soviet Union.
[00:01:59.484 --> 00:02:00.205]  I really do, Alex.
[00:02:00.831 --> 00:02:08.196]  I think that you can't continue to have the income tax that penalizes work, subsidizes illegitimacy, and rewards dependency.
[00:02:08.236 --> 00:02:12.119]  It's time to throw it out, abolish the IRS, repeal the 16th Amendment.
[00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:17.923]  Now, you know, I support a flat, fair 25% consumption tax on final retail sales.
[00:02:18.303 --> 00:02:20.504]  Now, my opponents are saying that's going to hurt the poor.
[00:02:20.825 --> 00:02:27.589]  Quite frankly, Alex, Harvard did a study and said when you throw out the burdensome compliance of the IRS, he said the prices are going to drop.
[00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.871]  The prices will probably be similar to what we have now.
[00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:39.040]  But finally, for those naysayers, those people who are under the poverty level will simply take their pay stubs to the government, and there will be a system as there exists now.
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.766]  The only difference with the trafficking bill, Alex, is everybody must work who gets a government stipend.
[00:02:45.087 --> 00:02:49.051]  I don't care if they have 12 children that work at the daycare center with those children,
[00:02:49.551 --> 00:02:55.575]  You see, anybody that visits Broadway or visits Las Vegas from Germany and Japan did pay into our tax scheme.
[00:02:55.935 --> 00:02:58.637]  And finally, it's a trade reciprocity program.
[00:02:58.937 --> 00:03:01.939]  If a country has barriers against ours, we have barriers against them.
[00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.202]  We also quantify the standard we're living in each country and weigh that down.
[00:03:06.582 --> 00:03:08.083]  With tariffs as necessary.
[00:03:08.443 --> 00:03:11.725]  But it's a flat 25% final retail sales tax.
[00:03:12.165 --> 00:03:18.029]  No taxes on used materials, but just new retail sales and services.
[00:03:18.429 --> 00:03:23.932]  And Alex, if the country does not move to this scheme, America will implode like the Soviet Union.
[00:03:24.252 --> 00:03:26.594]  That's my prediction right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:03:26.914 --> 00:03:28.756]  Well, Congressman, I've seen the similar studies.
[00:03:28.816 --> 00:03:29.898]  I've talked to economists.
[00:03:30.298 --> 00:03:35.044]  It would be good if we only had one federal tax, other than the tariffs they could raise money with.
[00:03:35.925 --> 00:03:41.953]  The problem is, Obama and others, they want a VAT on every level, on top of the income tax.
[00:03:42.073 --> 00:03:43.054]  Yes, this is the problem.
[00:03:43.074 --> 00:03:44.716]  You've got to throw the income tax out.
[00:03:44.756 --> 00:03:48.520]  It was founded, and it's the predicate of the communist platform, of Karl Marx.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.881]  And it's done just that.
[00:03:50.222 --> 00:03:52.284]  It's made a dependent society over here.
[00:03:52.644 --> 00:03:55.768]  It's penalized work, and that's the last thing that the founders wanted.
[00:03:56.108 --> 00:04:03.176]  The reason we have the 16th Amendment, Alex, is when we first started the income tax, which, by the way, was only supposed to be on the rich people.
[00:04:03.736 --> 00:04:07.840]  It was taken to the Supreme Court, and it was struck down as unconstitutional.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:16.708]  As a result, we have this 16th Amendment, and some people feel that it wasn't adequately ratified to boot, and that maybe we shouldn't repeal the 16th Amendment.
[00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.292]  We should just disregard it because it wasn't, in fact, lawful.
[00:04:20.572 --> 00:04:21.913]  But I think, let's be safe.
[00:04:21.993 --> 00:04:23.555]  Let's repeal the 16th Amendment.
[00:04:23.895 --> 00:04:24.957]  Abolish the IRS.
[00:04:24.997 --> 00:04:26.359]  We don't need a Department of Energy.
[00:04:26.679 --> 00:04:28.322]  We don't need a Department of Education.
[00:04:28.502 --> 00:04:30.565]  There's too damn much government here, Alex.
[00:04:30.825 --> 00:04:34.651]  And what we don't need is we don't need more taxes on top of income taxes.
[00:04:35.649 --> 00:04:36.970]  James Traficant, stay there.
[00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:45.936]  Quick break, coming back with a long segment, talking about a host of issues and the demonization of the Tea Parties all over the news, saying they're racist, they're terrorists.
[00:04:46.436 --> 00:04:53.240]  Bill Clinton says that there's going to be another Oklahoma City and it's going to be the fault of the American people.
[00:04:54.001 --> 00:04:55.982]  We'll see what James Traficant says about that.
[00:04:56.302 --> 00:04:57.143]  Congressman, stay with us.
[00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:02.868]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:03.268 --> 00:05:08.230]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.330]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:10.651 --> 00:05:15.472]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:15.652 --> 00:05:16.613]  How much do you want?
[00:05:16.833 --> 00:05:17.553]  When do you want it?
[00:05:17.953 --> 00:05:19.554]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:19.834 --> 00:05:20.655]  When will you need it?
[00:05:20.915 --> 00:05:22.976]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:23.116 --> 00:05:24.197]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:25.778]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:05:25.978 --> 00:05:31.042]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:31.242 --> 00:05:34.384]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:34.824 --> 00:05:38.327]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:38.647 --> 00:05:39.628]  How much will you need?
[00:05:39.868 --> 00:05:40.489]  We don't know.
[00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:41.690]  How much do you want?
[00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:42.610]  All you can get.
[00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:43.671]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:43.911 --> 00:05:46.674]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[00:06:58.976 --> 00:07:01.279]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:07:01.299 --> 00:07:03.562]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:07:03.582 --> 00:07:06.505]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:07:06.906 --> 00:07:11.651]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:07:12.012 --> 00:07:16.217]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:07:16.517 --> 00:07:18.838]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:07:18.858 --> 00:07:21.399]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:07:21.739 --> 00:07:24.320]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:32.243]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:07:32.597 --> 00:07:37.821]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:07:37.842 --> 00:07:40.264]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:07:40.304 --> 00:07:44.267]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:07:44.527 --> 00:07:45.428]  And I got news for you.
[00:07:45.588 --> 00:07:46.909]  You're everyone else.
[00:07:46.949 --> 00:07:47.950]  Invisible Empire.

[00:08:00.604 --> 00:08:06.227]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:09.208 --> 00:08:13.210]  James Traficant, former congressman, is our guest.
[00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:14.570]  I've researched his case.
[00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:15.871]  It's even been on national news.
[00:08:15.911 --> 00:08:26.656]  They've admitted he was completely railroaded, set up, mainly because he was criticizing foreign aid, period, and foreign aid to Israel, and they told him they were going to get him.
[00:08:27.296 --> 00:08:32.259]  And we had Jane Graham, Oklahoma City bombing survivor, she's on the ninth floor on last week.
[00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:36.322]  She saw McVeigh and other feds planting gray sticks of butter, didn't know what they were.
[00:08:37.843 --> 00:08:39.844]  She brought this info to Congress, they wouldn't talk to her.
[00:08:39.864 --> 00:08:43.186]  The only person that would look at the information was James Traficant.
[00:08:43.666 --> 00:08:46.268]  And she said she talked to James Traficant's assistant in his office.
[00:08:46.288 --> 00:08:49.170]  She said, yeah, they came and said, give us those documents back.
[00:08:51.371 --> 00:08:54.372]  I'll be filing this coming Monday as an independent in one of two districts, I'm not sure.
[00:08:54.392 --> 00:08:59.715]  Because when I went to art school, if you will, Alex, they split the district up into three ways to make sure I could never come back.
[00:09:19.364 --> 00:09:23.947]  So I basically have no money, but I think money plays too much a part in politics anyway.
[00:09:24.307 --> 00:09:32.652]  I think it's time for somebody without a lot of money just to put the hay where the ghost can reach it and tell the people what's going on and run, and run the old-fashioned way.
[00:09:34.451 --> 00:09:40.956]  Well, you've certainly got a lot of name recognition and a lot of people love you and your state there and know that you were railroaded.
[00:09:40.996 --> 00:09:51.925]  We talked about that some last time, but perhaps because we have a new audience tuning in all the time, recap what happened to you and then we're going to get into some of the current things that are happening and get your take on it, like U.S.
[00:09:52.045 --> 00:09:54.807]  Army trains to confront Tea Party terrorists.
[00:09:55.168 --> 00:09:56.048]  This is confirmed.
[00:09:56.068 --> 00:10:01.613]  We have their internal training manuals where they prepare for gun confiscation and war against the American people.
[00:10:01.653 --> 00:10:03.955]  But first, recapping your railroading.
[00:10:04.571 --> 00:10:09.313]  Well, you know, number one, several of the people that were involved already now admitted they were pressured to lie.
[00:10:09.773 --> 00:10:19.577]  There's a young man in Nigeria, a young black man, that filed an affidavit with the Nigerian government, Mr. Okolo, that his life was ruined because he wouldn't perjure himself against trafficking.
[00:10:19.977 --> 00:10:29.541]  Bottom line, it was a six-year investigation, $15 million, over 250 agents, on or about the time, Alex, that the Trade Center and the Pentagon were being attacked.
[00:10:30.001 --> 00:10:34.982]  And the government voluntarily stated at this trial that they made no tapes on me at all.
[00:10:35.382 --> 00:10:41.923]  And now it's come out, and I can't prove it yet, but it's all over that they burned boxes and boxes of tapes because there was no physical evidence.
[00:10:42.324 --> 00:10:44.044]  They had seven people that said they bribed me.
[00:10:44.364 --> 00:10:45.984]  Three of them already recanted.
[00:10:46.304 --> 00:10:51.265]  The two major charges were dropped because those people admitted before trial they were pressured to lie.
[00:10:51.645 --> 00:10:56.667]  So now the prosecutors are working for an insurance company somewhere in Ohio, and they're scared to death.
[00:10:57.127 --> 00:10:58.707]  And I want to say this on your show.
[00:10:59.447 --> 00:11:07.393]  I want some whistleblower to come forward and confirm that they burned boxes and boxes of tapes they made on Jim Trafkin over a six-year investigation.
[00:11:07.734 --> 00:11:13.238]  Because the reason why they said they had no tapes, Alex, is I could use their own tapes against them and say, where's the crime?
[00:11:13.578 --> 00:11:15.039]  So now I think they're showing it.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.400]  I think it's coming out.
[00:11:16.441 --> 00:11:18.242]  I think most people realize what happened.
[00:11:18.522 --> 00:11:24.267]  And remember, I'm the guy that brought John Demonyik back home from Israel, who was on death row for being Ivan the Terrible.
[00:11:24.347 --> 00:11:26.929]  And maybe this is exclusive on your show today, Alex.
[00:11:27.549 --> 00:11:38.182]  That John Demonyuk from Germany on trial now has requested of his family and his defense that they bring me into Germany relative to this trial.
[00:11:38.202 --> 00:11:40.805]  And if I am subpoenaed, I am going to Germany.
[00:11:40.865 --> 00:11:42.928]  So that's an exclusive for you, Alex.
[00:11:43.504 --> 00:11:59.155]  And to recap that, the Israeli Supreme Court said you were right, you got him the documents, he was not the guy, we know who he was, looked nothing like this individual, and then still, the US government grabs him and sends him to Germany, when Israel said he's innocent!
[00:11:59.295 --> 00:12:00.756]  Yes, and you know what's amazing, Alex?
[00:12:00.796 --> 00:12:02.176]  I must give Israel credit for this.
[00:12:02.196 --> 00:12:04.537]  Their Supreme Court took my evidence.
[00:12:05.038 --> 00:12:05.538]  The U.S.
[00:12:05.578 --> 00:12:06.578]  courts wouldn't accept it.
[00:12:06.899 --> 00:12:09.340]  Congress wouldn't hold a hearing because they said it's too sensitive.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:16.423]  And Alex, what I said is, when this sensitivity, quote-unquote sensitivity, waived the Bill of Rights, my God, what happened to us?
[00:12:16.703 --> 00:12:20.625]  When you endanger the right of one American, you endanger the rights of all Americans.
[00:12:20.665 --> 00:12:24.347]  So, what's happening now, and I want this also as an update on your program,
[00:12:24.967 --> 00:12:28.890]  Israel would not convene a trial on this new matter.
[00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:30.671]  So they had to go to Germany.
[00:12:31.072 --> 00:12:33.373]  Our government is just trying to cover their tracks.
[00:12:33.854 --> 00:12:36.896]  Alex, they should be charged with attempted murder.
[00:12:36.956 --> 00:12:38.497]  They knew this man wasn't Ivan.
[00:12:38.997 --> 00:12:42.660]  And they suborned perjury, they obstructed justice, and they've got away with it.
[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.001]  They've gotten away with this, Alex.
[00:12:44.241 --> 00:12:45.242]  And they know he's ill.
[00:12:45.722 --> 00:12:46.923]  It's official oppression.
[00:12:47.103 --> 00:12:49.165]  I mean, they know he's innocent.
[00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:50.045]  They're just doing this.
[00:12:50.245 --> 00:12:53.208]  They're hoping he dies before there can even be a trial.
[00:12:53.408 --> 00:12:55.469]  They're trying to cover up for what they did in the past.
[00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:56.590]  Just remember this, Alex.
[00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:02.995]  The documents that I got that took him off a death row after being convicted were Justice Department documents.
[00:13:05.176 --> 00:13:07.358]  And the Justice Department knew that he was not the guy?
[00:13:07.518 --> 00:13:08.619]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[00:13:08.659 --> 00:13:09.560]  This is out of hand.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:10.841]  We need a mechanism.
[00:13:11.281 --> 00:13:12.482]  We need a mechanism, Alex.
[00:13:13.533 --> 00:13:20.018]  We need a mechanism where the FBI and the Justice Department can be, in fact, tried.
[00:13:20.078 --> 00:13:22.120]  One of my last bills was the Fair Justice Act.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:33.569]  The President would nominate, the Senate would confirm for a 10-year term, the Director of the Fair Justice Agency would have only one duty, Alex, and that would be to investigate and prosecute crimes within the Justice Department.
[00:13:33.889 --> 00:13:36.051]  My God, we got a police state coming at us!
[00:13:36.471 --> 00:13:40.134]  We've got a government that, we're basically economic slaves here.
[00:13:40.574 --> 00:13:42.516]  And no one's really looking at it seriously.
[00:13:42.776 --> 00:13:44.077]  That's why I'm giving you credit.
[00:13:44.557 --> 00:13:45.738]  You're going out on a limb.
[00:13:46.459 --> 00:13:52.103]  And I remember telling Connie Chung about Pan Am 103, be very careful how you handle Pan Am 103.
[00:13:52.784 --> 00:13:57.227]  And she did an hour special on the confidential report I got.
[00:13:57.307 --> 00:14:01.050]  And all I want to say is this, a couple weeks later she was never seen on TV again.
[00:14:02.401 --> 00:14:06.243]  You are a very courageous guy, and I've been following you.
[00:14:06.743 --> 00:14:13.066]  And I know that there are many people in the government that are very upset because you are educating the American people.
[00:14:13.426 --> 00:14:15.106]  And American people have been dumbed down.
[00:14:15.467 --> 00:14:20.869]  Dumbed down through a mainstream media that has, in fact, aided and abetted this government, and I don't understand why.
[00:14:21.328 --> 00:14:22.689]  Jim Traficant is our guest.
[00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:27.893]  Congressman, I don't want to talk about myself, but I am in the middle of this and I want to ask your advice.
[00:14:29.674 --> 00:14:36.360]  The ADL, the Southern Property Law Center, in the last six months or so have put out multiple reports apiece.
[00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:41.222]  They're now even saying Ron Paul is a terrorist enabler.
[00:14:42.002 --> 00:14:45.083]  They're saying Judge Napolitano is an extremist terrorist enabler.
[00:14:45.564 --> 00:14:52.086]  The MIAC Homeland Security reports that law enforcement sent us over a year ago say that gun owners, conservatives, returning veterans, I'm sure you've seen that in the news.
[00:14:52.486 --> 00:14:58.149]  Now we've gotten Army documents and we've confirmed that they're following us around in the Fed rallies.
[00:14:58.789 --> 00:15:25.307]  Uh, we've confirmed that, uh, in these briefings for the military, they project my photo up and, like, I'm the kingpin, or the, or the godfather, and, and say that I want cops to die, and that I want the milit- it just all lies, and the national news, Nightline, you name it, have been down here, CNN, I mean, I mean, the list goes on and on, and they keep saying on the news, and George Soros' outfit keeps saying, I'm calling for violence, when it's the opposite.
[00:15:25.667 --> 00:15:27.068]  What does that sound like to you?
[00:15:27.108 --> 00:15:28.589]  I mean, are they really getting ready to set me up?
[00:15:28.609 --> 00:15:36.796]  Well, it sounds to me as if you're a great American, and you're making touch and contact with the average American, and they don't like it.
[00:15:36.857 --> 00:15:38.078]  Let me just say this, Alex.
[00:15:38.398 --> 00:15:39.979]  There's no doubt that you're doing that.
[00:15:40.059 --> 00:15:41.721]  Now, here's what you have to be concerned about.
[00:15:42.121 --> 00:15:46.946]  That any technicality could be brought against you, and my God, they can be very vicious.
[00:15:47.026 --> 00:15:48.007]  But let me say this.
[00:15:48.387 --> 00:15:50.389]  I think this is a badge of honor.
[00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:56.996]  My name was mentioned one time in an IRS review that said the American people shouldn't listen to Congressman Jim Travagan.
[00:15:57.296 --> 00:15:58.577]  He's just anti-government.
[00:15:58.817 --> 00:16:01.960]  And that was one of the biggest compliments I ever received.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.744]  And I think this is a compliment to you because I think it shows you as a leader.
[00:16:06.024 --> 00:16:08.947]  Now the downside is I don't like what they're doing to this Tea Party.
[00:16:09.287 --> 00:16:10.587]  These are average American people.
[00:16:10.848 --> 00:16:24.492]  They don't want to blow anything up, and they're not going out there and acting violently, and Alex Jones is not recommending that anybody go out and cause any violence or revolution in this country, and anybody with a bright mind and a reasonable mind understands that.
[00:16:24.972 --> 00:16:28.673]  But, what they're trying to do is stop this movement, and the reason for it is very simple.
[00:16:28.953 --> 00:16:30.894]  The American people are fed up, and they should be.
[00:16:31.554 --> 00:16:32.515]  They should be fed up.
[00:16:32.875 --> 00:16:36.539]  And I think what you're doing is you're articulating the reasons why they're fed up.
[00:16:37.119 --> 00:16:44.126]  The problem with the Tea Party to a degree is they're so upset but they don't really understand the total dimension of why they're upset.
[00:16:44.466 --> 00:16:48.470]  And number one, they're just opposing rather than advocating as well.
[00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:50.952]  But I think they're starting to evolve now, Alex.
[00:16:51.292 --> 00:17:00.757]  With leadership that they're hearing from individuals like yourself, and from commentary made by you and some others, that they're starting to look and say, look, here's what we've got to do now.
[00:17:01.097 --> 00:17:02.698]  Here's what must be done in the country.
[00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:12.243]  And I think what we have underway is a powerful political revolution taking place in the United States of America, and I believe the powers that be are trying to stop it.
[00:17:12.523 --> 00:17:15.645]  They're trying to say that these people are radical, they're racist, they're bigots.
[00:17:16.725 --> 00:17:23.170]  I've been hit with the anti-Semite business, the racist business, the bigot business, but listen to what I stand for.
[00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:29.594]  If you're an illegal immigrant in this country, you're not just an immigrant, you're an illegal immigrant and you should be thrown the hell out.
[00:17:30.134 --> 00:17:30.855]  Enough is enough.
[00:17:31.135 --> 00:17:35.518]  And we shouldn't be paying healthcare to take care of people that are driving our costs up.
[00:17:35.858 --> 00:17:36.939]  So that makes me a bigot?
[00:17:37.439 --> 00:17:38.741]  Look, that's just the way it is.
[00:17:38.821 --> 00:17:40.903]  If you're an Hispanic American, you're a friend of mine.
[00:17:41.283 --> 00:17:46.789]  If you're an illegal immigrant, I don't care what nationality you are, you're not a friend of mine and you should be thrown out.
[00:17:47.169 --> 00:17:49.711]  And we've got to do something about that to take care of our borders.
[00:17:50.112 --> 00:17:53.816]  I really feel sorry what's going on in Arizona and the way they're depicting Arizona.
[00:17:54.216 --> 00:18:01.063]  You know, I am the Congressman, Alex, that passed putting 10,000 soldiers on our border and keeping people out and keeping drugs out.
[00:18:01.583 --> 00:18:06.969]  And listen, these soldiers are overseas in Germany and in Japan and in Korea.
[00:18:07.209 --> 00:18:09.011]  They're going to the theater and going to lunch.
[00:18:09.291 --> 00:18:10.793]  They're guarding the borders in the Mideast.
[00:18:11.193 --> 00:18:12.895]  And God, our borders are wide open!
[00:18:13.335 --> 00:18:17.520]  What kind of national security and homeland security does America have?
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:18.641]  This is a joke?
[00:18:19.162 --> 00:18:20.283]  Both of these parties are...
[00:18:21.784 --> 00:18:28.386]  Basically, trying to seduce this growing minority population of Hispanics into a voting bloc.
[00:18:28.446 --> 00:18:31.488]  And it's larger now than the African-American community.
[00:18:31.908 --> 00:18:32.608]  Enough is enough.
[00:18:32.988 --> 00:18:34.309]  Let's take care of our government.
[00:18:34.629 --> 00:18:35.549]  Call us what you want.
[00:18:35.969 --> 00:18:39.510]  But I just pray to God that you just continue to do what you're doing.
[00:18:39.851 --> 00:18:43.572]  The reason they're focusing on you is you're effective.
[00:18:44.571 --> 00:18:46.953]  And that's the reason they focused on you, and that's what's scary.
[00:18:47.073 --> 00:18:49.635]  I don't want to go to prison with them setting me up for something.
[00:18:49.695 --> 00:18:53.258]  Well, don't think that that's forelone.
[00:18:53.678 --> 00:18:55.500]  Here's the thing I could be concerned about.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:03.967]  You know, I don't know what your relationship is with your network, but there'll be people behind the scenes trying to take that microphone away from you because you're having an impact.
[00:19:04.407 --> 00:19:04.747]  I know it.
[00:19:04.948 --> 00:19:06.629]  Let me tell you how I know about it.
[00:19:07.756 --> 00:19:12.758]  I can't explain to you how many times people have said to me, I heard your comments on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:13.138 --> 00:19:14.038]  I'm very proud of you.
[00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:15.798]  I agree with you.
[00:19:16.599 --> 00:19:18.339]  Thank you for doing the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:18.659 --> 00:19:20.180]  We think Alex does a great job.
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.040]  We were surprised you were on there.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.941]  Some people may be afraid to be on there, and they say, we don't know why, but we're glad you were on there, Jim.
[00:19:27.382 --> 00:19:30.102]  And people, but the bottom line is, I've heard this all over.
[00:19:30.522 --> 00:19:33.263]  People commenting about this everywhere I go, Alex.
[00:19:33.283 --> 00:19:35.844]  So you're reaching people, and I think you're
[00:19:36.324 --> 00:19:45.128]  You're reaching people with an intelligent approach, and there's certainly no doubt in my mind you're not advocating any type of violence or anything.
[00:19:45.188 --> 00:19:45.748]  None of us are.
[00:19:45.788 --> 00:19:48.369]  Congressman, thank you for your kind words on that subject and your advice.
[00:19:48.709 --> 00:19:55.912]  Let's come back in to get into some other issues, but continue to discuss where you see this nation going and talk about Oklahoma City 15 years later.
[00:19:55.932 --> 00:19:57.232]  We'll be right back with James Traficant.
[00:20:01.994 --> 00:20:03.155]  Remain in your houses.
[00:20:03.988 --> 00:20:09.175]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[00:20:09.776 --> 00:20:10.777]  Will they do it?
[00:20:11.137 --> 00:20:13.100]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[00:20:13.741 --> 00:20:19.768]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[00:20:20.209 --> 00:20:21.470]  Think it can't happen here?
[00:20:22.391 --> 00:20:25.913]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[00:20:26.673 --> 00:20:30.955]  Executive Order 10-995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[00:20:31.555 --> 00:20:35.837]  Executive Order 10-998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[00:20:36.458 --> 00:20:41.280]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:50.325]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:52.907]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.
[00:20:53.127 --> 00:20:55.989]  Go to MartialLawSurvival.com right now.
[00:20:56.189 --> 00:20:59.111]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.632]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:21:02.713 --> 00:21:04.915]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:21:05.035 --> 00:21:07.838]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:21:08.238 --> 00:21:12.983]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:21:13.344 --> 00:21:17.548]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:21:17.848 --> 00:21:20.192]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:21:20.312 --> 00:21:22.716]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:21:23.076 --> 00:21:25.660]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:33.612]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:21:33.932 --> 00:21:39.197]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:21:39.317 --> 00:21:41.599]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:21:41.639 --> 00:21:45.602]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:21:45.862 --> 00:21:46.763]  And I got news for you.
[00:21:46.943 --> 00:21:48.244]  You're everyone else.
[00:21:48.284 --> 00:21:49.385]  Invisible Empire.

[00:22:00.854 --> 00:22:04.015]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[00:22:04.235 --> 00:22:12.259]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[00:22:12.419 --> 00:22:15.160]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most
[00:22:16.707 --> 00:22:30.298]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:30.458 --> 00:22:34.861]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:35.022 --> 00:22:40.746]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[00:22:40.846 --> 00:22:44.169]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:44.469 --> 00:22:47.350]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:49.331 --> 00:22:52.112]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:22:52.232 --> 00:22:52.992]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:54.513 --> 00:22:56.574]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:56.654 --> 00:23:01.596]  Let's talk tough.
[00:23:02.076 --> 00:23:03.257]  Let's talk comfort.
[00:23:03.477 --> 00:23:05.618]  Let's talk about down-home value.
[00:23:05.878 --> 00:23:08.379]  Made in the USA blue jeans.
[00:23:08.799 --> 00:23:10.499]  Like you wore as a kid.
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:11.260]  Remember?
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.641]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[00:23:15.666 --> 00:23:18.368]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:23:20.269 --> 00:23:23.652]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:23:24.312 --> 00:23:26.674]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:32.513]  Put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:23:33.233 --> 00:23:36.415]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[00:23:37.016 --> 00:23:37.796]  Others don't.
[00:23:37.836 --> 00:23:40.898]  For good old-fashioned comfort, get diamond gusset jeans.
[00:23:41.198 --> 00:23:42.479]  Every stitch guaranteed.
[00:23:42.699 --> 00:23:45.701]  In our Defender motorcycle jean comes Kevlar reinforced.
[00:23:45.962 --> 00:23:48.443]  See them at G-U-S-S-E-T dot com.
[00:23:48.503 --> 00:23:49.844]  That's gusset dot com.
[00:23:49.944 --> 00:23:50.405]  Or call 888-848-7738.
[00:23:50.425 --> 00:23:50.705]  That's 888-848-7738.
[00:23:50.725 --> 00:23:51.545]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[00:23:51.565 --> 00:23:51.866]  Others don't.
[00:23:59.872 --> 00:24:03.656]  What if I say I'm not like the others?
[00:24:03.676 --> 00:24:07.280]  What if I say I'm not just another one of your players?
[00:24:08.567 --> 00:24:10.368]  Former Congressman is our guest.
[00:24:11.009 --> 00:24:14.711]  Mexico has collapsed because of their phony drug war.
[00:24:15.251 --> 00:24:16.212]  It's totally criminal.
[00:24:16.272 --> 00:24:19.815]  There's murders, ranchers being killed, Texas, Arizona.
[00:24:20.235 --> 00:24:21.055]  I mean, it's a mess.
[00:24:21.115 --> 00:24:22.476]  And then, meanwhile, Washington Post.
[00:24:22.736 --> 00:24:25.258]  Human rights observers killed in attack in Mexico.
[00:24:25.278 --> 00:24:30.422]  And it talks about all over Mexico, they're shutting the power and water off to Indian groups that live down there.
[00:24:30.602 --> 00:24:33.844]  Mexico's very racist towards the Indian population.
[00:24:33.864 --> 00:24:34.524]  I don't know why.
[00:24:34.684 --> 00:24:37.987]  I mean, the folks in Mexico are Indian and Spanish, mainly.
[00:24:38.787 --> 00:24:42.609]  And some Germans that immigrated there during the colonial system.
[00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:43.690]  And then here's another one.
[00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:46.452]  Mexico acknowledges migrant abuse pledges changes.
[00:24:46.852 --> 00:24:48.813]  I mean, they don't give free welfare to any people.
[00:24:48.853 --> 00:24:50.995]  They arrest illegals instantly.
[00:24:51.015 --> 00:24:55.797]  I as an American can't go down there with my wife and have a baby and have it all paid for.
[00:24:56.078 --> 00:24:58.119]  I mean, this is a sick joke, Congressman.
[00:24:58.729 --> 00:25:00.491]  Absolutely Alex, you're right on target.
[00:25:00.832 --> 00:25:02.934]  I think we even have to change the Constitution.
[00:25:03.014 --> 00:25:14.167]  If someone comes across our border illegally for the purpose of having a child and having an American citizen, I think that should be changed and the citizenship should be denied and the woman should be removed from the country.
[00:25:14.507 --> 00:25:15.188]  Enough is enough.
[00:25:15.308 --> 00:25:19.413]  No one realizes, you know, we had a case up here in Northeast Ohio, just real quick Alex.
[00:25:19.893 --> 00:25:23.855]  Where a fella went in with a card and got a surgery on his pancreas.
[00:25:24.335 --> 00:25:29.117]  And ten days later, another fella came in with the same card to get surgery, and they did the surgery.
[00:25:29.137 --> 00:25:31.258]  They didn't realize it until they checked the paperwork.
[00:25:31.638 --> 00:25:38.761]  And they were both illegal, can't find them, and did two particular surgeries that the American people, our people up here, ended up paying for.
[00:25:39.121 --> 00:25:40.681]  I mean, this is in our own backyard.
[00:25:41.002 --> 00:25:47.964]  Now, imagine what this is like in voting booths with fake IDs, fake driver's licenses, fake Social Security cards.
[00:25:48.325 --> 00:25:49.145]  It's gone too far.
[00:25:49.924 --> 00:25:57.396]  And now we're talking about, we're talking about making citizens amnesty out of illegals who jump the fence.
[00:25:57.697 --> 00:26:04.047]  My God, Alex, this is putting a neon sign right on the border saying, hey, jump the fence and eventually you become an American citizen.
[00:26:05.584 --> 00:26:09.007]  Well, the feds are financing illegal checkpoints to the states everywhere.
[00:26:09.407 --> 00:26:18.172]  All this Arizona law says is that if they have suspicion and then you're an illegal, when they pull you over for drunk driving or whatever it is, that the state's going to take you to the feds.
[00:26:18.192 --> 00:26:20.234]  I mean, all that's doing is enforcing the law.
[00:26:20.494 --> 00:26:25.457]  Since when are states not supposed to, you know, if they catch somebody committing a federal crime, to not arrest them?
[00:26:26.084 --> 00:26:26.424]  Amen.
[00:26:26.484 --> 00:26:29.365]  It's the United States of America, not the federal government of America.
[00:26:29.385 --> 00:26:30.985]  And let me say this on your show.
[00:26:31.485 --> 00:26:33.065]  I support the Arizona law.
[00:26:33.085 --> 00:26:36.286]  Because the reason for the Arizona machination is simple.
[00:26:36.606 --> 00:26:40.407]  The federal government has failed to act on behalf of the American people.
[00:26:40.687 --> 00:26:43.567]  The federal government's job is for national security.
[00:26:43.867 --> 00:26:47.828]  And how the hell can you have national security with a border that's not secure?
[00:26:48.148 --> 00:26:49.148]  Someone tell me that.
[00:26:49.588 --> 00:26:50.828]  So, I support.
[00:26:51.268 --> 00:26:54.009]  I support what they're doing in Arizona, and they've got to stand up
[00:26:54.509 --> 00:26:57.532]  This is a microcosm of the failed policies of America.
[00:26:57.852 --> 00:26:59.693]  Bring the American people's attention to it.
[00:26:59.733 --> 00:27:07.499]  Now, the mainstream media is making Arizona look like racists, look like bigots, and they're going to lose conventions, and they're going to lose money.
[00:27:07.739 --> 00:27:13.404]  Look, the bottom line is the federal government has caused this problem for Arizona and for all these border states.
[00:27:13.704 --> 00:27:15.986]  The federal government should be taking the brunt of the attack.
[00:27:16.426 --> 00:27:19.868]  That's why they don't like Alex Jones, and that's why they don't like Jim Travigan.
[00:27:20.108 --> 00:27:22.709]  Because the truth of the matter is very plain for us to see.
[00:27:23.049 --> 00:27:25.690]  The federal government has failed to secure our borders.
[00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:29.692]  How can you have a homeland security border programmed with a border wide open, Alex?
[00:27:30.772 --> 00:27:45.379]  Well, what do you think about Obama announcing yesterday he's sending SWAT teams to, quote, all the oil rigs, and some Reagan administration officials are on record saying they believe this is greasing the skids for the feds nationalizing oil.
[00:27:46.528 --> 00:27:47.628]  I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:27:47.648 --> 00:27:50.109]  The way the country's going, we've nationalized everything.
[00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:51.170]  Just keep this in mind.
[00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:57.252]  General Motors, government motor stock, is now trading at 27 cents a share.
[00:27:58.032 --> 00:27:59.252]  Let's be honest about this.
[00:27:59.572 --> 00:28:02.373]  We have buoyed up a false economic illusion here.
[00:28:02.773 --> 00:28:05.594]  All these new hires they're talking about, Alex, were census workers.
[00:28:06.275 --> 00:28:12.977]  Now you've got a health bill with, listen to this, 159 new boards, programs, and entities to be created.
[00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:22.633]  More IRS enforcement plus an additional 16,500 IRS employees to be hired at a cost of 1.7 trillion dollars.
[00:28:23.293 --> 00:28:28.895]  All these jobs, we have more government workers and factory workers already and this is a false illusion.
[00:28:29.335 --> 00:28:36.077]  I think the best thing that could be done is the states have got to put their foot down here and that we have no more states right.
[00:28:36.617 --> 00:28:43.581]  They're background music in a doctor's office, and maybe Arizona will highlight the issue of the United States of America.
[00:28:43.881 --> 00:28:48.563]  Remember, there used to be a nation known as USSR, and now they broke up.
[00:28:48.623 --> 00:28:50.745]  Don't think we can't implode, and I predict that.
[00:28:51.245 --> 00:28:57.768]  I predict, unless there's a direct intended change in taxes that starts to reward work, that we're going to implode.
[00:28:57.988 --> 00:28:58.929]  It's just a matter of time.
[00:28:59.994 --> 00:29:06.461]  Well, you got the federal government calling for carbon taxes, but then China and India and Mexico and others don't have to have the carbon taxes.
[00:29:06.841 --> 00:29:08.363]  I mean, that will kill the economy.
[00:29:08.663 --> 00:29:10.545]  Why does the federal government want to kill the economy?
[00:29:10.745 --> 00:29:11.446]  You know what, Alex?
[00:29:11.486 --> 00:29:20.576]  What's really funny is the reports in the house say, the forensic reports say, that most of the carbon problems in America are brought in from the trade winds from the Far East.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:22.540]  From China and Japan!
[00:29:22.981 --> 00:29:27.462]  And these countries don't want to do anything about their carbon emissions.
[00:29:27.863 --> 00:29:37.827]  I think, look, I think it's time for us to say we can handle our economic problems, and the world can handle theirs too, but good fences make good board, make good friends.
[00:29:38.147 --> 00:29:39.167]  Stay there, stay there.
[00:29:39.387 --> 00:29:41.988]  Jim Travacant, former congressman of Ohio, is our guest.
[00:29:42.228 --> 00:29:48.411]  We'll talk about Oklahoma City straight ahead, and a lot more in his campaign, how you can get involved in it, getting back in Congress.
[00:29:50.031 --> 00:29:53.032]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.952 --> 00:29:56.733]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.014 --> 00:30:01.294]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:01.314 --> 00:30:06.655]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:30:06.895 --> 00:30:11.537]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:30:11.917 --> 00:30:14.977]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[00:30:15.197 --> 00:30:16.958]  And it's possible that it could even happen again.
[00:30:17.498 --> 00:30:22.179]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:30:22.719 --> 00:30:24.640]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:29.621]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:30:29.821 --> 00:30:30.721]  And here's the best part.
[00:30:30.941 --> 00:30:33.722]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:30:34.002 --> 00:30:37.303]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:30:37.623 --> 00:30:40.464]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:30:40.804 --> 00:30:42.704]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:30:43.025 --> 00:30:45.205]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:30:46.285 --> 00:30:48.286]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:30:49.046 --> 00:30:56.348]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:30:56.668 --> 00:30:59.129]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:31:00.509 --> 00:31:02.590]  Max, what did you do with the remote?
[00:31:03.413 --> 00:31:04.414]  Now what am I going to do?
[00:31:04.835 --> 00:31:06.597]  I guess I can go online to find a new one.
[00:31:06.997 --> 00:31:07.358]  Okay.
[00:31:07.898 --> 00:31:08.519]  Here's a site.
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.582]  Replacementremotes.com.
[00:31:10.682 --> 00:31:12.904]  Let us repair or replace any remote control.
[00:31:13.365 --> 00:31:15.627]  Well, I guess they can't repair this one.
[00:31:16.188 --> 00:31:16.949]  Thanks, Max.
[00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:18.291]  Wow!
[00:31:18.751 --> 00:31:20.153]  They have my original remote!
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:23.223]  And an exact replacement that doesn't need programming.
[00:31:23.443 --> 00:31:24.744]  Hey Max, here's a deal.

[00:31:41.374 --> 00:31:42.915]  I wonder if they sell dog toys?

[00:32:00.339 --> 00:32:02.922]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:32:03.342 --> 00:32:08.308]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:32:08.668 --> 00:32:10.410]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:15.535]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:32:15.716 --> 00:32:16.697]  How much do you want?
[00:32:16.917 --> 00:32:17.638]  When do you want it?
[00:32:18.018 --> 00:32:19.619]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:32:19.899 --> 00:32:20.720]  When will you need it?
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:23.041]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:32:23.181 --> 00:32:24.281]  Will there be any food?
[00:32:24.522 --> 00:32:25.842]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:32:26.042 --> 00:32:31.105]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:32:31.305 --> 00:32:34.487]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:32:34.887 --> 00:32:38.369]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:32:38.709 --> 00:32:39.689]  How much will you need?
[00:32:39.929 --> 00:32:40.550]  We don't know.
[00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:41.750]  How much do you want?
[00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:42.670]  All you can get.
[00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:43.731]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:32:43.971 --> 00:32:46.732]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:32:47.012 --> 00:32:47.372]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:32:47.532 --> 00:32:49.212]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:32:49.252 --> 00:32:50.273]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:32:50.313 --> 00:32:50.593]  Put a muscle.
[00:33:06.308 --> 00:33:08.370]  We are back live with Jim Traficant.
[00:33:08.611 --> 00:33:09.632]  What an interesting person.
[00:33:09.692 --> 00:33:16.099]  He's not only a former congressman, he was drafted into the NFL for the Pittsburgh Steelers.
[00:33:17.419 --> 00:33:24.803]  In 1963, he also obtained a master's degree from the University of Pittsburgh and another from York Youngstown State University.
[00:33:24.823 --> 00:33:36.349]  We're going to be going back to him here in just a moment and talk about Oklahoma City and some other subjects and also take some phone calls for the Congressman and they can also talk about the
[00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:43.779]  The experiences they've had with law enforcement and the military being militarized to go up against the American people.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:45.902]  But Jim Trafagan is our guest.
[00:33:45.963 --> 00:33:48.947]  We've had two new films come out in the month of April.
[00:33:49.921 --> 00:33:52.742]  And one is Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined.
[00:33:53.242 --> 00:34:03.947]  Two hours plus, jam-packed, 18 months in the making, government narcotics trafficking, white slavery running, staging terror attacks, police state, how the globalists operate.
[00:34:04.007 --> 00:34:05.408]  I mean, it's an encyclopedia.
[00:34:05.708 --> 00:34:08.909]  The new film available on DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:11.711]  And your purchase of the DVD also supports our broadcast.
[00:34:11.731 --> 00:34:13.812]  You can make copies of it, give it to everyone you know.
[00:34:13.872 --> 00:34:15.532]  The people are ready to be awakened.
[00:34:15.552 --> 00:34:19.014]  And I don't really get the credit for the effect this show's having.
[00:34:20.114 --> 00:34:22.056]  It's really you, the listeners, that are taking action.
[00:34:22.076 --> 00:34:23.637]  So I want to thank all of you that have taken action.
[00:34:23.978 --> 00:34:28.341]  And of course, we released this film last week, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[00:34:28.962 --> 00:34:35.667]  A year in the making, covers the police state, the military being trained to take on the American people, and so much more.
[00:34:36.428 --> 00:34:44.775]  It proves that the underwear bombing was a staged event, with eyewitnesses that we interviewed that were on the plane, and that saw the feds getting him on the plane, and that's now been admitted, by the way.
[00:34:45.095 --> 00:34:45.575]  Police State 4.
[00:34:47.065 --> 00:34:57.847]  The Rise of FEMA, you can get both the films together and get them discounted, or you can also call toll free to order 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[00:34:58.027 --> 00:35:06.849]  And you can also watch the films in super high quality and this live broadcast that we simulcast with the radio at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:08.169]  Going back to Jim Trafficant.
[00:35:08.189 --> 00:35:10.770]  Jim, Oklahoma City, I mean, take us back to 1995.
[00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:17.695]  And again, the reason I bring this up is, I mean, you've been involved in everything I investigate.
[00:35:17.735 --> 00:35:20.617]  If it's exposing tyranny, you find Jim Traficant there.
[00:35:20.657 --> 00:35:36.150]  I didn't even know that no member of Congress would talk to her and other survivors of that horrible bombing, that she saw the feds in there, what she later learned, planting bombs with telephone wire and gray sticks of butter in the weeks before, including Tim McVeigh and others.
[00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:48.896]  Uh, and that when she and others brought you this information, that you were the only person that would look at it, and that she said that your staff said that you were threatened to shut up about it, but that you wouldn't shut up.
[00:35:48.956 --> 00:35:51.717]  So give us your take on what happened there.
[00:35:52.176 --> 00:36:03.501]  Number one, I don't think there's any way that that truckload of fertilizer that exploded outside could have had the type of impact internally that showed from that.
[00:36:04.041 --> 00:36:06.302]  And immediately, I had my doubts.
[00:36:06.362 --> 00:36:11.324]  What's amazing about it is, the reason I was the only one, is Congress is afraid.
[00:36:11.585 --> 00:36:13.866]  Most members of Congress don't want to get involved in anything.
[00:36:14.106 --> 00:36:16.367]  First of all, they're made to look like a kook if you do.
[00:36:16.827 --> 00:36:21.349]  Second of all, they're made to look like you're un-American if you do, because they're going to have the mainstream press against you.
[00:36:21.749 --> 00:36:26.472]  But since the Demonia case, everybody would rely on me, and I got most of the information.
[00:36:26.852 --> 00:36:40.201]  What I found out, and what I felt would happen in Oklahoma City, that there was much broader conspiracy and activity involved there, and I wouldn't be surprised, for some reason, that there were complications that involved government and government officials as well.
[00:36:40.945 --> 00:36:42.566]  That's what my deduction was.
[00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:51.172]  But I couldn't get to first base with anything, Alex, and you have to understand, you have to have something concrete, which I was able to develop in the Demoniuk case.
[00:36:51.533 --> 00:36:56.256]  They couldn't get around the evidence, but I had to send it to an Israeli Supreme Court to get anything done with it.
[00:36:56.576 --> 00:37:05.643]  So you could imagine the problem I was getting trying to get and garner and glean more information relative to the Oklahoma City bombing.
[00:37:05.723 --> 00:37:07.044]  But what I can say is this.
[00:37:08.129 --> 00:37:09.510]  There's a lot more to it.
[00:37:09.891 --> 00:37:13.735]  And I don't believe anything anymore the government is telling the American people.
[00:37:14.115 --> 00:37:15.977]  I don't want to get involved in the 9-1-1 issue.
[00:37:16.257 --> 00:37:18.439]  But I have my doubts about 9-1-1 as well.
[00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:25.106]  Now remember, I got the demonic information and I got the actual factual information on Pan Am 103.
[00:37:26.307 --> 00:37:28.389]  And I know exactly what happened to Pan Am 103.
[00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:31.072]  And it's not what our government said happened.
[00:37:31.462 --> 00:37:32.923]  Tell us what happened with Pan Am 103.
[00:37:33.443 --> 00:37:45.090]  The report I got was an intelligence report that said a man named Ahmed Jibril and Manzour Al-Qassar were hired by Iran to respond to America's shooting down of that Iranian Airbus, if you recall that.
[00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:45.651]  Yes.
[00:37:45.931 --> 00:37:48.793]  And they put together an international team and they couldn't find a target.
[00:37:50.113 --> 00:37:57.718]  And Manzour Al-Qassar, who shipped heroin from the Golden Triangles to New York through Frankfurt,
[00:37:59.261 --> 00:38:04.104]  Started to see Ahmed Jibril's people around Frankfurt Airport.
[00:38:04.765 --> 00:38:18.053]  And supposedly he was worried it was going to ruin his gravy train, and there was an anonymous call made warning there's going to be a terrorist act around the airport, but there was no increase in security to more or less chase Ahmed Jibril away.
[00:38:18.373 --> 00:38:21.275]  The bottom line is the plane went down over Lockerbie.
[00:38:21.756 --> 00:38:25.178]  It was supposed to go down over the ocean, but wind drift took it over Lockerbie.
[00:38:25.758 --> 00:38:26.919]  Here's the things I could tell you.
[00:38:26.939 --> 00:38:32.544]  Number one, there was an anonymous call made at Frankfurt International with no increase in security.
[00:38:32.885 --> 00:38:42.093]  And second of all, two weeks after the incident, first President Bush asked for Ahmed Jibril to be extradited to the United States and Syria denied it.
[00:38:42.814 --> 00:38:49.220]  Manjreel Qasr was the biggest heroin man and he made his living
[00:38:49.893 --> 00:38:51.454]  Shipping to America.
[00:38:51.754 --> 00:39:02.082]  Now, what the report said was that he was influential, Alex, in getting French hostages released from Iran, and he was working with the CIA Lebanon office to get American hostages.
[00:39:02.122 --> 00:39:04.404]  At the time, I believe there were eight there, Alex.
[00:39:05.104 --> 00:39:14.411]  It said that there was nothing good happening, so the CIA sent a team to see what was going on, headed by an Army Major McKee from Pittsburgh on leave to the CIA.
[00:39:15.072 --> 00:39:17.874]  Alex, all of those five CIA agents and
[00:39:18.702 --> 00:39:26.930]  Major McKee were killed on that 103 flight but what it was is our government
[00:39:27.802 --> 00:39:38.728]  The report says, covered up the truthful incident, because the American people knew that heroin was being overlooked because this valuable asset, Monserrat Casar, did be a revolution over here.
[00:39:39.189 --> 00:39:46.993]  So the first thing the government said is trafficking is anti-government, CIA said it's nonsense, and naturally no one went with it, but Connie Chung went with it.
[00:39:47.353 --> 00:39:52.556]  And the truth of the matter was, they end up arresting these two Libyans, one of them was even released.
[00:39:52.977 --> 00:39:56.819]  And believe me, if they were guilty, they'd have choked on a chicken bone over there in Qaddafi's prison.
[00:39:57.463 --> 00:39:58.744]  This is the truth of what happened in 103.
[00:39:59.664 --> 00:40:02.605]  So I didn't have the time to look into 911, but I'll tell you this.
[00:40:03.005 --> 00:40:05.186]  I was starting to get reports, Alec.
[00:40:06.066 --> 00:40:07.747]  People were starting to confide in me.
[00:40:08.347 --> 00:40:11.469]  And what I don't like is, I don't believe the Commission.
[00:40:11.849 --> 00:40:14.970]  I didn't believe the Warren Commission, and I didn't believe the Commission
[00:40:16.398 --> 00:40:16.798]  On 9-1-1.
[00:40:17.298 --> 00:40:24.243]  I believe these commissions are nothing more than to ensure that there's no reprisals and repercussions from the American people.
[00:40:24.583 --> 00:40:26.465]  And I think that's why they're concerned about you.
[00:40:26.485 --> 00:40:28.626]  I think you're exposing these things.
[00:40:28.947 --> 00:40:31.308]  And I think America's better off if we know the truth.
[00:40:31.809 --> 00:40:33.350]  We know the truth about our government.
[00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:35.411]  And this is where I think the problem is.
[00:40:35.431 --> 00:40:37.813]  The American people don't trust the government anymore.
[00:40:38.173 --> 00:40:40.275]  And I see a tremendous upheaval.
[00:40:40.895 --> 00:40:43.316]  I see an American political revolution.
[00:40:43.336 --> 00:40:50.700]  Now, maybe 2010 may not be the actual fulcrum for that occurring, but it's not far off, Alex.
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:41:03.746]  You're going to see a tremendous upheaval in this country where the American people are going to respond to this illegal immigration issue, this so-called cap-and-trade type issue, this big government healthcare issue with 159 new boards, and going to, in fact,
[00:41:07.964 --> 00:41:11.326]  In fact, ensure almost 50 million illegal immigrants.
[00:41:11.646 --> 00:41:15.289]  There's a hell of a lot more than 12 to 15 illegals in this country, Alex.
[00:41:15.309 --> 00:41:19.111]  When the truth comes out, I think you're going to, the American people are going to revolt.
[00:41:19.511 --> 00:41:22.673]  But I think it's going to be a peaceful revolution, and let me say this.
[00:41:23.214 --> 00:41:28.917]  I know that you've never advocated violence, but you are advocating that the American people take a stand.
[00:41:29.218 --> 00:41:34.481]  Now what bothers me is, they're trying to paint this Tea Party as something sinister, and it's not.
[00:41:35.109 --> 00:41:41.571]  You know what bothers me more than that is all these politicians keep saying, we need you to vote, we need you to get involved in government.
[00:41:41.911 --> 00:41:43.631]  Well, here's a group that's getting involved.
[00:41:43.912 --> 00:41:45.052]  They're getting very involved.
[00:41:45.072 --> 00:41:47.993]  And everybody's saying, whoa, we don't want you to be involved.
[00:41:48.013 --> 00:41:49.333]  Well, it's what they're calling for.
[00:41:49.353 --> 00:42:00.076]  I mean, they're calling for lower taxes, abolish the Federal Reserve, have national sovereignty, defend our borders, defend the Second Amendment, do what this country was built on to be Americans.
[00:42:00.596 --> 00:42:02.357]  And that was the question I was about to bring back up.
[00:42:03.257 --> 00:42:11.600]  Bill Clinton and others go on TV and say, gee, I hope there isn't another Oklahoma City caused by the Tea Parties, but I'm afraid it's going to happen.
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:21.523]  The only card that criminal elements of the government can play is to stage a terror attack, another Oklahoma City in this country, to go after the American people.
[00:42:21.543 --> 00:42:27.045]  And I see them framing myself by name, but the entire Tea Party and Libertarians and Ron Paul
[00:42:28.331 --> 00:42:29.572]  Alex is very unfortunate.
[00:42:29.612 --> 00:42:32.014]  I've said this without disrespect, but I'm going to say it right here on your show.
[00:42:32.034 --> 00:42:33.775]  They don't call Clinton Slick Willie for nothing.
[00:42:45.194 --> 00:42:46.395]  The Democrats are worried.
[00:42:46.795 --> 00:42:54.241]  They're worried that the American people are going to take their venom out on the party in power, as they did years ago, when they threw Hastert and the Republicans out.
[00:42:54.601 --> 00:42:57.243]  Truth of the matter is, both of these parties have been compromised.
[00:42:57.704 --> 00:42:59.906]  I talked about it on the Greta Van Susteren Show.
[00:43:00.266 --> 00:43:01.547]  I talked about it on your show.
[00:43:01.887 --> 00:43:03.268]  I've been labeled an anti-Semite.
[00:43:03.649 --> 00:43:07.952]  We have basically a foreign nation, Israel, who's controlling the American Congress.
[00:43:08.232 --> 00:43:10.454]  They've got us in two wars and have bankrupted us.
[00:43:10.874 --> 00:43:16.238]  And now, we're in a situation where the American people are saying, why are our kids coming back in body bags?
[00:43:16.598 --> 00:43:17.919]  What are we doing over there?
[00:43:18.299 --> 00:43:20.841]  Why are we continuing to go bankrupt with these wars?
[00:43:21.261 --> 00:43:26.184]  Now they're starting to sense that the American people don't even control their Congress, which they don't.
[00:43:26.684 --> 00:43:27.825]  This is the tragedy here.
[00:43:28.165 --> 00:43:38.232]  But to have former President Clinton, who is still very popular, come out and say, my God, if something bad is going to happen, because this Tea Party, this Tea Party can produce some bad things.
[00:43:39.278 --> 00:43:43.641]  If there's anything bad that happened, it's because the American people are totally disgusted.
[00:43:43.961 --> 00:43:51.206]  A man who flew his plane into an IRS building in Texas, a man who bulldozed his home in Ohio because he was tired at the bank.
[00:43:52.067 --> 00:43:53.027]  This is what's happening.
[00:43:53.047 --> 00:43:59.812]  You're seeing the American people react because their government is failing to address the problems that exist in the country.
[00:44:00.973 --> 00:44:01.313]  Period.
[00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:24.382]  I agree with you, and there's lots of things happening that are real, but if you look at the preconditioning and the buildup and even the Hattari militia, we've documented that was a total federal setup with people inside provocateuring them to shoot their mouths off, and so they're having these busts to create this background story that, oh look, the gun owners are about to attack, and we know, we have the documents,
[00:44:25.242 --> 00:44:28.463]  That they're training the military for gun confiscation.
[00:44:28.503 --> 00:44:30.864]  We've had the mayor of Schenectady, New York.
[00:44:30.904 --> 00:44:37.907]  We've had house reps in the legislature of Illinois and others calling for troops on the streets.
[00:44:38.408 --> 00:44:39.848]  I mean, this is getting really creepy.
[00:44:40.208 --> 00:44:42.589]  Well, let me tell you, the politicians should be calling for troops.
[00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:43.810]  Troops on the border.
[00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:45.691]  To stay off of the American people.
[00:44:45.991 --> 00:44:48.292]  And that second amendment wasn't protect duck hunters.
[00:44:48.872 --> 00:44:51.274]  It was to protect the American people from the government.
[00:44:51.654 --> 00:44:54.535]  And let me tell you something, they're bringing this on themselves.
[00:44:54.896 --> 00:44:59.018]  But the good thing that's happening is all these issues are now coming to light, Alex.
[00:44:59.614 --> 00:45:06.318]  They're coming to light because you, as a leader, you as a leader, and there are others out there, but they're not as strong.
[00:45:06.858 --> 00:45:08.079]  This is what I'm saying to you.
[00:45:08.499 --> 00:45:10.040]  Now you have to be very careful.
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:14.142]  They will make some technicality into a major cardinal crime.
[00:45:14.663 --> 00:45:15.643]  That's the way it works.
[00:45:16.043 --> 00:45:19.946]  So I think you having heard these comments, I think you know that.
[00:45:20.006 --> 00:45:20.366]  You're very
[00:45:20.546 --> 00:45:23.587]  No, I know, and I'm very aware of it, and I appreciate you talking about it.
[00:45:23.727 --> 00:45:26.287]  I mean, I never intended to have this big of an effect.
[00:45:26.347 --> 00:45:32.348]  I mean, I wanted to have an effect, but I didn't know I'd get in a position where there's so many of these documents that are saying, there's the enemy, get him, get him.
[00:45:32.688 --> 00:45:35.889]  But I've talked to so many troops that have called me and sent us information.
[00:45:36.329 --> 00:45:42.830]  They say that's why the troops and police then tune into the show, because they're told, don't listen to Alex Jones, he's bad.
[00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:47.331]  I mean, the government is smart at certain levels, but it's also stupid.
[00:45:48.007 --> 00:45:49.288]  Alex, you know the amazing thing?
[00:45:49.308 --> 00:45:54.531]  When I brought John Demonik home, I got a number of calls sorted just like this.
[00:45:54.551 --> 00:45:55.071]  Just listen.
[00:45:55.692 --> 00:45:56.692]  Good job, Congressman.
[00:45:56.712 --> 00:45:57.273]  We're proud of you.
[00:45:57.393 --> 00:45:57.733]  Hang up.
[00:45:58.694 --> 00:45:59.574]  Good job, Congressman.
[00:45:59.734 --> 00:46:00.054]  Hang up.
[00:46:00.955 --> 00:46:04.337]  The reason those calls were so quick is they were coming from the Justice Department.
[00:46:05.228 --> 00:46:08.770]  Believe me, the people in the government knew what they did to Dominic.
[00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:11.952]  There's a lot of people in the government don't like what's going on, Alec.
[00:46:12.312 --> 00:46:14.873]  There's a lot of people in the government that are listening to you.
[00:46:15.414 --> 00:46:18.135]  Now, the problem is we're starting to get all this militia talk.
[00:46:18.175 --> 00:46:21.257]  We need militia because we've got all these groups that are establishing.
[00:46:21.517 --> 00:46:27.220]  Look, all of the government's troops should be concentrating on securing our borders
[00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:28.361]  We're good to go.
[00:46:47.316 --> 00:46:58.108]  Democrat presidents and what they're saying loud and clear and everybody's trying to dilute it because they're afraid that the party in power is going to be removed and that's where President Clinton come in.
[00:46:58.168 --> 00:47:04.275]  I think it's very unfortunate that he made that statement, but I'm going to make this statement on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:05.236 --> 00:47:07.619]  They don't call him Slick Willie for nothing.
[00:47:08.493 --> 00:47:17.877]  And I made that statement on a Robert Novak show when the IRS threatened a veto of the IRS reform bill because of the trafficking language that changed the burden of proof.
[00:47:18.277 --> 00:47:23.260]  And I said on the Robert Novak show that President Clinton isn't called Slick Willy for nothing.
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:30.863]  He could sign the bill and help the American taxpayers or he could veto the bill and help a few IRS agents and he signed the bill.
[00:47:31.103 --> 00:47:33.044]  And that's the type of pressure we need to put back.
[00:47:33.724 --> 00:47:35.765]  President Clinton should not have made that statement.
[00:47:36.105 --> 00:47:37.526]  He should reverse that statement.
[00:47:39.238 --> 00:47:39.758]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:47:40.799 --> 00:47:41.719]  This is what I'm saying.
[00:47:42.179 --> 00:47:43.499]  Disregard that statement.
[00:47:43.739 --> 00:47:45.020]  That's a political statement.
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:48.361]  That's not a national security statement, and it's unfortunate.
[00:47:49.221 --> 00:47:50.101]  Let me bring up another issue.
[00:47:50.121 --> 00:47:55.583]  I'm going to take a few calls for you and also give out your address for people that want to support your campaign or physically get involved.
[00:47:55.603 --> 00:47:56.523]  You're filing Monday.
[00:47:56.543 --> 00:47:58.704]  We want to have you back as that unfolds.
[00:47:58.744 --> 00:48:00.185]  You're very gracious with your time, sir.
[00:48:00.685 --> 00:48:02.405]  Again, Jim Travagant joining us.
[00:48:03.606 --> 00:48:07.047]  It has come out that a lot of Republicans and Democrats are gay.
[00:48:08.027 --> 00:48:08.087]  I'm
[00:48:24.548 --> 00:48:28.129]  You know, a very serious, focused guy who I've been watching for over a decade.
[00:48:28.149 --> 00:48:31.530]  I've never heard Mr. Gein say something that wasn't true.
[00:48:31.850 --> 00:48:40.573]  He says he's got it down pat that Lindsey Graham is just running around basically all over the place, you know, in the streets, cruising, and that they're blackmailing him.
[00:48:40.833 --> 00:48:45.695]  Five days after that information was released, Graham said, I'm not doing immigration reform.
[00:48:46.075 --> 00:48:47.816]  I'm not going for the carbon tax.
[00:48:48.756 --> 00:48:58.584]  He said, I'm done, and how big a problem is black male in Congress for congressmen and women who really are involved in hanky-panky?
[00:48:58.644 --> 00:48:59.644]  It's very big, Alex.
[00:48:59.704 --> 00:49:16.717]  Now look, I can't speak on any individual case, but again, as I got personal information, remember I'm the fellow on the House floor that said that Janet Reno was a lesbian and she was controlled by organized crime who had photographs of her with young women.
[00:49:17.498 --> 00:49:28.267]  Now, I was protected by the Speech and Debate Clause, but I went on again, a national TV show, the Robert Novak Show, and I re-edited those statements, and I said, go ahead, Janet.
[00:49:28.587 --> 00:49:30.769]  I'm not protected by the Speech and Debate Clause.
[00:49:31.089 --> 00:49:42.778]  Take me to court, because maybe now we'll find out why you will not allow an investigation in $10 million from a red Chinese army general that went to President Clinton's campaign fund.
[00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:45.721]  And I never heard a word from her.
[00:49:45.781 --> 00:49:46.922]  Now, they put me in prison!
[00:49:47.972 --> 00:49:49.213]  But listen to what I'm telling you.
[00:49:49.693 --> 00:49:50.814]  She was controlled.
[00:49:51.675 --> 00:49:53.716]  The Attorney General of the United States was controlled.
[00:49:54.036 --> 00:49:58.339]  The CIA and anybody listening to this, the FBI, come on and pick up Jim Travigan.
[00:49:58.379 --> 00:49:59.260]  I'm on probation.
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:03.103]  Right here on the Alex Jones Show, I'm saying that she was a lesbian.
[00:50:03.663 --> 00:50:09.547]  She was, in fact, appointed an assistant prosecutor in Dade County, the cocaine capital of America.
[00:50:09.868 --> 00:50:15.952]  She was ultimately, after the prosecutor resigned, appointed the prosecutor, then won re-election.
[00:50:16.937 --> 00:50:26.146]  Now, that's one I knew about, but I can guarantee you there are people in Washington that are afraid to say anything because of their background.
[00:50:27.026 --> 00:50:31.971]  There are people who are afraid, and this is the thing I don't like.
[00:50:32.051 --> 00:50:33.232]  Congressman, I've got to interrupt.
[00:50:33.512 --> 00:50:34.773]  I'm skipping a network break.
[00:50:35.054 --> 00:50:36.495]  This break belongs to the network.
[00:50:36.535 --> 00:50:37.916]  Stations should not run over this.
[00:50:38.277 --> 00:50:39.658]  I'm skipping the break for time.
[00:50:40.218 --> 00:50:41.039]  Go ahead, Congressman.
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:58.005]  The bottom line is, I don't know if you remember, but Jane Harman from California was picked up on a voice recorder of promising American-Israeli Public Affairs Committee that she'd get their two spies out of prison if they used their influence to make her the chairman of the Intelligence Committee.
[00:50:58.025 --> 00:50:58.905]  Yeah, that was on the news.
[00:50:59.465 --> 00:51:01.706]  Yeah, but it was hidden away real fast.
[00:51:02.443 --> 00:51:03.964]  And it was hidden away real good.
[00:51:04.445 --> 00:51:11.050]  But do you know that the two spies were ultimately turned loose by our Attorney General Holder?
[00:51:11.490 --> 00:51:13.992]  And he said, we're not sure that they had bad intent.
[00:51:14.553 --> 00:51:22.759]  Well, keep in mind, Alex, that the man that they were working with in the Pentagon, Larry Franklin, is still in prison for 12 years for giving secrets.
[00:51:23.079 --> 00:51:29.024]  And what their efforts were, they were attempting to mobilize the Pentagon to attack Iran.
[00:51:29.890 --> 00:51:30.911]  Look, enough is enough.
[00:51:31.471 --> 00:51:33.212]  Everybody's afraid down there, Alex.
[00:51:33.272 --> 00:51:45.279]  And the thing I don't like is the IRS has thousands of times testified before Congress and said the only weapon we have to collect voluntary taxes is the element of fear.
[00:51:45.979 --> 00:51:55.265]  Alex, how does fear, and the word fear, and the process of fear even enter into the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Independence?
[00:51:55.345 --> 00:51:57.206]  My God, what has happened to us, Alex?
[00:51:57.426 --> 00:52:00.807]  Well, Congressman, I did the research at the time.
[00:52:00.847 --> 00:52:14.931]  I know it was in two major Florida papers that she was actually caught when she was just a prosecutor, so drugged out on alcohol and pills, vomiting in the back of a car in a parking garage with a 13-year-old girl.
[00:52:15.351 --> 00:52:23.614]  It also came out in, I believe it was lawsuits, you can pull this up, that she would go check out kids that had been CPS'd from the CPS.
[00:52:23.654 --> 00:52:24.674]  Did you ever see that info?
[00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:40.659]  No, the information that I had was that the powers that be and the cocaine business had photographs of her with young ladies in compromising situations, and she was really ineffective and impotent in anything she'd try and do.
[00:52:41.279 --> 00:52:50.645]  The reason that I got so involved with Janet Reno is she testified before Congress about Waco, that they did everything not to push David Koresh over the edge.
[00:52:51.895 --> 00:52:55.496]  Listen, no one got more information than me on that case, Alex, and listen to this.
[00:52:55.937 --> 00:53:00.598]  David Koresh went jogging every morning, and went for lunch, and went for breakfast in the local town.
[00:53:00.979 --> 00:53:03.379]  They could have arrested him in town and there would have been no problem.
[00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:05.020]  They wanted that stage.
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:11.322]  They wanted that stage to try and change the IRS law of these exemptions for these church-related activities.
[00:53:11.723 --> 00:53:12.803]  And it blew up in her face.
[00:53:13.083 --> 00:53:20.426]  But when she testified to Congress and said we didn't want to pressure him and push him over the edge, I wasn't on that committee or I'd ask her this question.
[00:53:20.806 --> 00:53:35.457]  Then, my God, why did you have strobe lights on that building all night and play the recordings of dying rabbits at the screaming decibel level so high it was heard in villages five miles away if you didn't want to push anybody over the edge?
[00:53:35.737 --> 00:53:36.278]  She lied.
[00:53:36.698 --> 00:53:46.265]  But the thing that bothered me is we had a general in the Red Chinese Army, Alex, that gave $10 million to the Clinton campaign, and she never investigated it.
[00:53:46.305 --> 00:53:48.727]  She said it wasn't worthy of an investigation.
[00:53:49.307 --> 00:53:54.569]  Now my God, we have China right now that is controlling much of the money supply in America.
[00:53:54.809 --> 00:53:57.209]  They're controlling the commerce and trade of America.
[00:53:57.449 --> 00:54:02.111]  You have Israel that's controlling the national and international policies of America.
[00:54:02.431 --> 00:54:05.932]  Where the hell do the American people come in and why isn't anybody saying it?
[00:54:06.889 --> 00:54:10.634]  Well, this is an incredible interview with James Traficant.
[00:54:10.674 --> 00:54:13.938]  I know you're on the road right now, traveling, and if you can't do it, it's fine.
[00:54:14.178 --> 00:54:16.100]  We're going to break here in about five minutes.
[00:54:16.381 --> 00:54:19.104]  For one minute, can we have an extra additional five minutes with you?
[00:54:19.424 --> 00:54:20.446]  I'd be honored.
[00:54:20.466 --> 00:54:21.347]  And let me tell you something.
[00:54:22.205 --> 00:54:25.248]  I am concerned about you, but you're making one hell of an impact.
[00:54:40.143 --> 00:54:42.505]  And it came out the Delta Force was there.
[00:54:42.525 --> 00:54:49.351]  It was in Time Magazine that Israeli troops of all people and British troops were there.
[00:54:50.051 --> 00:54:53.975]  As a congressman who was there during those investigations, what's your intel on that?
[00:54:55.863 --> 00:55:05.408]  It was a joke, the way the mainstream media actually turned it around, where many Americans at the dinner table were saying, they got just what they deserved down there in Texas.
[00:55:05.608 --> 00:55:06.449]  My God, Alex.
[00:55:06.769 --> 00:55:11.091]  There were 17 kids incinerated, children incinerated in that building.
[00:55:11.732 --> 00:55:20.536]  I had seen films of it, where many of those guns and many of those heavy artillery was aimed right at the exit point, where no one was coming out of there.
[00:55:21.056 --> 00:55:24.058]  Look, Janet Reno and the Justice Department,
[00:55:25.504 --> 00:55:26.825]  Should have gone to prison over that.
[00:55:27.345 --> 00:55:28.646]  And another one that was very bad.
[00:55:28.706 --> 00:55:32.168]  Now, sir, you're not a white supremacist, and you're not a racist.
[00:55:32.248 --> 00:55:32.669]  I know that.
[00:55:32.709 --> 00:55:40.794]  Neither am I. But this fellow, Randy Weaver, out there in Idaho, they shot his wife holding their infant child right between the eyes, a marksman.
[00:55:41.154 --> 00:55:43.996]  Killed a dog and killed his 14-year-old boy.
[00:55:44.436 --> 00:55:49.579]  I made a speech every week until they settled, and he ended up settling for about $5 million with the government.
[00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:50.740]  But they did that.
[00:55:52.887 --> 00:55:59.349]  They entangled that man because he was supposedly a white supremacist and was a political target of the United States government.
[00:55:59.389 --> 00:56:03.950]  Look, I'm not into any white supremacist, black supremacist, black power business.
[00:56:04.350 --> 00:56:07.171]  I'm for a straight and honest American society.
[00:56:07.591 --> 00:56:12.192]  But regardless of what your politics are, I don't think that you should be singled out.
[00:56:12.492 --> 00:56:13.574]  Well, I know Weaver.
[00:56:13.694 --> 00:56:15.676]  He was former Special Forces.
[00:56:15.997 --> 00:56:18.480]  They wanted him to be an informant against the Aryan Nations.
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:19.602]  We'd only visited once.
[00:56:20.723 --> 00:56:23.186]  He was, quote, separating himself from society.
[00:56:23.527 --> 00:56:24.889]  None of that was even true.
[00:56:25.169 --> 00:56:28.534]  And when he wouldn't go be an informant for them, they went and did what they did.
[00:56:28.974 --> 00:56:29.795]  Yeah, it was a shame.
[00:56:29.835 --> 00:56:31.676]  What they did is they came to him and trapped him.
[00:56:31.736 --> 00:56:34.317]  They cut the saw off two barrels off shotguns.
[00:56:34.337 --> 00:56:35.278]  He said, why don't you do it?
[00:56:35.678 --> 00:56:37.119]  They said, well, you know, we don't want to get into that.
[00:56:37.139 --> 00:56:37.959]  We don't know what we're doing.
[00:56:37.999 --> 00:56:39.060]  You know, you know what you're doing.
[00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:40.481]  And they entrapped the guy.
[00:56:40.741 --> 00:56:44.283]  But the way they come in with a SWAT team and the way they destroyed that family.
[00:56:44.663 --> 00:56:46.404]  But see, this is what America's not seeing.
[00:56:46.444 --> 00:56:48.466]  They're not seeing the other side of the one-eyed jack.
[00:56:49.006 --> 00:56:50.187]  Let me tell you something, Alex.
[00:56:50.727 --> 00:56:52.288]  And that's seven and a half years in prison.
[00:56:52.989 --> 00:56:56.818]  I'm probably more knowledgeable than anyone that ever served in Congress.
[00:56:56.879 --> 00:57:00.087]  That isn't self-serving, because I've seen the other side of this thing.
[00:57:00.814 --> 00:57:02.654]  And see, I know what you're talking about.
[00:57:03.114 --> 00:57:05.755]  You're very unpopular in the nation's capital.
[00:57:06.235 --> 00:57:09.656]  But your popularity is growing because people know you're telling the truth.
[00:57:10.096 --> 00:57:15.137]  And you're touching subjects that people are afraid to even comment on.
[00:57:15.537 --> 00:57:16.517]  This is what bothers me.
[00:57:16.837 --> 00:57:18.777]  Do we have freedom of speech in America?
[00:57:18.857 --> 00:57:20.377]  Well, do we have mice or men?
[00:57:20.437 --> 00:57:23.718]  I mean, I'm not looking for trouble, but I can't control myself.
[00:57:23.738 --> 00:57:27.499]  When I see corruption and people being oppressed, I've got to stand up against it.
[00:57:27.779 --> 00:57:29.039]  And I, quite frankly, don't.
[00:57:29.699 --> 00:57:31.060]  Don't give a damn if they kill me.
[00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:32.880]  I don't want that to happen, but I'm committed.
[00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:34.541]  Well, let me tell you something.
[00:57:34.561 --> 00:57:40.923]  The truth of the matter is there are a lot of Americans like you, and they don't have the microphone, and they respect the hell out of you for it.
[00:57:41.183 --> 00:57:43.444]  And that's why you have a tremendous responsibility.
[00:57:43.724 --> 00:57:47.486]  You have a tremendous responsibility with the pressure that you're going to be getting.
[00:57:47.766 --> 00:57:50.647]  And after having an interview with Jim Trafigan,
[00:57:51.187 --> 00:57:54.628]  My God, they're going to have their antenna up completely.
[00:57:54.688 --> 00:57:59.909]  But what I'm saying are things that I know that I've investigated myself.
[00:58:00.369 --> 00:58:09.850]  And when I brought a man home off a death row for mass murder, and Israel called me at my hotel in Jerusalem and said, he'll be in Tel Aviv tomorrow night, Congressman.
[00:58:09.870 --> 00:58:10.451]  Take him home.
[00:58:10.851 --> 00:58:13.631]  That tells you that I got the right information.
[00:58:15.331 --> 00:58:16.352]  And the government knew it.
[00:58:17.092 --> 00:58:18.112]  And then you're demonized.
[00:58:19.221 --> 00:58:21.002]  And they set you up and put you in prison.
[00:58:21.322 --> 00:58:22.102]  We're going to come back.
[00:58:23.383 --> 00:58:24.383]  I'm sorry to the callers.
[00:58:24.403 --> 00:58:31.526]  It's just that all the info he keeps bringing out, I want to get every minute we can because he was in the middle of all of this in Congress for so long.
[00:58:31.766 --> 00:58:33.107]  But we'll see about going to your calls.
[00:58:33.207 --> 00:58:37.309]  Regardless, I'll get to them when we come back after the congressman's left us in about eight minutes.
[00:58:37.489 --> 00:58:38.669]  We'll be back in 70 seconds.
[00:58:38.689 --> 00:58:43.051]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:44.512 --> 00:58:46.793]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:49.414 --> 00:58:50.674]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:50.714 --> 00:58:56.076]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:58:56.316 --> 00:59:00.938]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:59:01.318 --> 00:59:01.718]  It's true.
[00:59:01.798 --> 00:59:06.360]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:11.583]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:59:12.124 --> 00:59:14.045]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:59:14.425 --> 00:59:19.048]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:59:19.248 --> 00:59:20.149]  And here's the best part.
[00:59:20.349 --> 00:59:23.131]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.

[00:59:39.981 --> 00:59:45.763]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:59:46.083 --> 00:59:48.543]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:59:52.404 --> 00:59:54.325]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:54.785 --> 00:59:57.546]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:09.377 --> 01:00:09.457]  Yeah.
[01:00:21.067 --> 01:00:23.648]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:00:23.808 --> 01:00:26.009]  Jim Trafficant, final segment with him.
[01:00:26.429 --> 01:00:36.654]  We have talked about so many issues, but going back to blackmail in Congress, you know, they can selectively either falsely charge somebody or use a crooked toenail to put them in prison.
[01:00:37.114 --> 01:00:45.678]  And then meanwhile, I've been talking for years about Goldman Sachs openly robbing everyone, and the people we've talked to, the experts here, they believe that these Justice Department
[01:00:46.158 --> 01:00:55.668]  Criminal research, criminal investigation is just a big cover-up, and the civil indictment is just a big cover-up, because Goldman Sachs is Obama's biggest contributor.
[01:00:55.888 --> 01:00:57.369]  Where do you see this going, Congressman?
[01:00:57.529 --> 01:00:59.551]  Well, I don't see anything happening to anybody.
[01:00:59.611 --> 01:01:09.902]  I think there's a big network of people that surround our government, they control our government, and I think we have to start looking again at foreign entanglements like First President Washington warned us of.
[01:01:10.462 --> 01:01:17.015]  Back then it was Britain, but now, believe me, we have Israel that's very powerful, and they're very powerful on Wall Street.
[01:01:17.335 --> 01:01:21.223]  The thing that bothers me is much of our government has been coming from Goldman Sachs.
[01:01:21.934 --> 01:01:25.956]  They've been sending their people into our decision-making process.
[01:01:26.036 --> 01:01:26.756]  I think it's time.
[01:01:27.217 --> 01:01:28.857]  Audit the Fed isn't enough.
[01:01:28.897 --> 01:01:29.938]  We've got to end the Fed.
[01:01:30.318 --> 01:01:33.780]  Coin money, as the Constitution says, and we can promulgate a plan to do that.
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:36.741]  I think it's time to throw many of these departments of government out.
[01:01:37.001 --> 01:01:40.143]  Department of Energy was supposed to take our dependents off of foreign oil.
[01:01:40.503 --> 01:01:42.864]  Hell, we have more dependency now than we had back then.
[01:01:43.224 --> 01:01:48.887]  Department of Education, I think it's time for the states to handle that and the local school boards to make salient decisions.
[01:01:49.327 --> 01:01:52.149]  And I think there's so many things, but Alex, I'm saying this on your show.
[01:01:52.729 --> 01:02:14.661]  If we do not, in fact, abolish the IRS and repeal the income tax, and let the American people get their entire pay with no withholding, no tax on savings, no corporate tax, no capital gains tax, no inheritance and death taxes, no more Social Security, no more Medicare tax, no more audits, no more paperwork, no more receipts, no more accountants, no more attorneys, and that 25% tax
[01:02:17.276 --> 01:02:32.264]  We'll cover these problems, and second of all, as Harvard studies said, when we take the burdensome compliance off this Communist Progressive Income Tax, that prices will drop so significantly that we will have hardly no increase in prices we have now.
[01:02:32.564 --> 01:02:43.110]  And finally, for those under the latter, they take their receipts into the government, and the government would give them, as they have now, assistance programs, but that would be coupled with work.
[01:02:43.490 --> 01:02:47.393]  And finally, all this underground narcotic business, they'd pay taxes.
[01:02:47.774 --> 01:02:51.136]  And they're now on SSI, and their wives are in public housing, by the way.
[01:02:51.517 --> 01:02:59.803]  Second of all, all these people come to visit Broadway and Las Vegas, Germany, Japan, all over the world, Canada, they would pay into our tax scheme.
[01:03:00.184 --> 01:03:08.650]  And we can turn to... The people are not free, and we will not be free until we take the yoke of the income tax off the American people.
[01:03:08.690 --> 01:03:11.873]  We've got to reward work and personal industry.
[01:03:12.133 --> 01:03:12.954]  That's my statement.
[01:03:13.314 --> 01:03:15.176]  Alright, Congressman, we are out of time.
[01:03:15.276 --> 01:03:17.558]  Very gracious to give us this much time.
[01:03:17.578 --> 01:03:19.800]  People need to get involved with your campaign.
[01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:20.921]  You're officially filing next week.
[01:03:20.941 --> 01:03:21.862]  We're going to give them an address.
[01:03:22.222 --> 01:03:25.825]  People want to support you financially in that here in just a moment.
[01:03:25.845 --> 01:03:31.390]  But I would just add, Kennedy cut the income tax by 50% and government tax receipts doubled.
[01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:35.271]  The government knows when they cut taxes they get more money because the economy speeds up.
[01:03:35.531 --> 01:03:40.392]  They want to control the economy, and that's why they're only expanding government.
[01:03:40.692 --> 01:03:44.053]  We've got to at least just stop the growth of it, or it's over, as you said.
[01:03:44.613 --> 01:03:46.593]  Give us your address so people can support you.
[01:03:46.613 --> 01:03:53.174]  429 North Main Street, Poland.
[01:03:53.974 --> 01:03:56.675]  Just like the country, P-O-L-A-N-D, Ohio, 44514.
[01:03:57.475 --> 01:03:58.315]  One more time.
[01:04:02.811 --> 01:04:07.476]  429 North Main Street, Poland, Ohio 44514
[01:04:09.929 --> 01:04:17.975]  Well, resistance is victory, and by you running, you're going to be able to be on the news, and you're going to be able to bring real issues to the table, whether you win, lose, or draw.
[01:04:18.035 --> 01:04:20.396]  It's a victory that you're running, and I'm glad you're doing it.
[01:04:20.416 --> 01:04:21.437]  You've got huge support.
[01:04:22.057 --> 01:04:27.941]  The news reports, thousands of people coming to your rallies, you know, hundreds and hundreds of people, even in the small towns.
[01:04:27.961 --> 01:04:31.504]  So you've got a big support base out there, and we appreciate what you're doing.
[01:04:32.024 --> 01:04:37.308]  Congressman Jim Traficant, all the demonization, all the lies you've gone through, but you're, you know,
[01:04:37.568 --> 01:04:41.692]  On the outside now, exposing this tyranny, and I look forward to talking to you again in the near future.
[01:04:43.353 --> 01:04:44.695]  God bless you.
[01:04:44.715 --> 01:04:45.796]  Keep up your good work, Alex.
[01:04:46.236 --> 01:04:46.877]  Will try, sir.
[01:04:46.917 --> 01:04:48.998]  And as you said last time, no need to be beamed out.
[01:04:49.259 --> 01:04:51.961]  There is intelligent life in America, just not in Washington.
[01:04:53.943 --> 01:04:54.744]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:04:54.764 --> 01:04:55.625]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[01:04:55.645 --> 01:04:59.068]  We'll be right back with your phone calls, a ton of news, and Wayne Madsen coming up.
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:04.861]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:05.202 --> 01:05:13.325]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:05:14.065 --> 01:05:18.086]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:05:18.687 --> 01:05:29.511]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:05:30.131 --> 01:05:39.160]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:44.705]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:05:45.085 --> 01:05:52.252]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:52.572 --> 01:05:55.335]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:04.291]  Tyranny is here.
[01:06:04.651 --> 01:06:08.332]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:06:08.372 --> 01:06:10.773]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:06:10.793 --> 01:06:16.255]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[01:06:16.675 --> 01:06:22.917]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:06:23.337 --> 01:06:28.879]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:33.001]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:06:33.501 --> 01:06:37.503]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:06:37.783 --> 01:06:43.305]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:06:43.725 --> 01:06:46.707]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:06:47.287 --> 01:06:48.687]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:06:49.248 --> 01:06:49.688]  It's here.

[01:07:06.255 --> 01:07:11.017]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:07:11.397 --> 01:07:17.900]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:07:20.117 --> 01:07:22.423]  They sow pride in every stitch.
[01:07:24.188 --> 01:07:26.494]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:07:38.261 --> 01:07:40.142]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:07:40.402 --> 01:07:41.902]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:07:42.202 --> 01:07:44.763]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:07:45.083 --> 01:07:49.144]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.

[01:07:51.704 --> 01:07:53.905]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:07:54.405 --> 01:07:55.825]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:07:55.985 --> 01:07:56.446]  Got it.
[01:07:56.766 --> 01:07:57.646]  Others don't.
[01:07:59.833 --> 01:08:04.884]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:05.265 --> 01:08:07.550]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:19.102]  We're now eight minutes into the final hour.
[01:08:19.943 --> 01:08:23.006]  I tell you, talking to Jim Traficant was creeping me out.
[01:08:23.026 --> 01:08:26.629]  Even off air, he was telling me, you better watch it.
[01:08:26.649 --> 01:08:27.650]  They're going to try to set you up.
[01:08:27.670 --> 01:08:28.750]  You've got a lot of power now.
[01:08:29.451 --> 01:08:38.559]  And he was telling me off air, you also heard him say it on air, that everywhere he goes, just all over the place, people are bringing up the interview he did on this show.
[01:08:38.579 --> 01:08:43.002]  And that's when I realized, like three years ago, I was in Roatan.
[01:08:43.863 --> 01:08:44.183]  Take care.
[01:09:01.812 --> 01:09:06.755]  Go into some shack to eat some fried fish and those people and I'd say, how do you know who I am?
[01:09:06.895 --> 01:09:08.796]  Oh, they make copies of your DVDs.
[01:09:09.177 --> 01:09:10.918]  You know, we watch it down at the church.
[01:09:11.198 --> 01:09:25.026]  And then I get callers calling in, you know, people in Brazil and people in Japan and I get sent photos almost every couple days in like Russia and in the Czech Republic and Germany.
[01:09:25.347 --> 01:09:27.188]  Infowars.com spray-painted
[01:09:27.648 --> 01:09:28.729]  You know, on buildings.
[01:09:29.589 --> 01:09:38.034]  And we get sent photos and I get called by, one time we got an email from the city government in a major town in New Zealand.
[01:09:38.454 --> 01:09:45.598]  And there was a giant shutdown factory and somebody at night had to do it with ropes, spray-painted Infowars.com across it.
[01:09:46.018 --> 01:09:53.983]  I'm not saying do that, but I mean the point is, is that, is that I've said over and over again, I am in over my head.
[01:09:55.329 --> 01:10:04.751]  I mean, ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center reports, government reports, secret army reports, and I don't just have the reports, I then talk to military.
[01:10:04.851 --> 01:10:11.373]  I then talk to family who are in the military and they say, no, you're in briefings.
[01:10:11.513 --> 01:10:14.593]  I mean, the Pentagon has me in briefings?
[01:10:14.614 --> 01:10:18.234]  I mean, I don't know how much longer I got here, folks.
[01:10:18.254 --> 01:10:20.875]  I mean, this is getting to the point of insanity.
[01:10:21.775 --> 01:10:25.557]  I mean, and I said I'm going to go to Terry, Chris, Sean, Larry, Tony and others.
[01:10:26.157 --> 01:10:36.783]  Before Trafficking came on, we were taking calls from military and police who were confirming the martial law drills, state police in Georgia, where they're training to go in and just kill whole families to take their guns.
[01:10:36.943 --> 01:10:44.107]  And then we have the internal drills where they take on the Tea Partiers and the military shows up in San Diego with sound cannons.
[01:10:44.807 --> 01:10:45.168]  What was that?
[01:10:45.348 --> 01:10:48.890]  Five months ago for the Tea Party and they're attacking everybody.
[01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:49.550]  I mean, it's just
[01:10:49.650 --> 01:10:51.211]  Does this nightmare have to happen?
[01:10:51.251 --> 01:10:53.873]  Does Goldman Sachs have to steal everything?
[01:10:54.153 --> 01:10:55.875]  Do we have to have carbon taxes?
[01:10:55.895 --> 01:10:57.356]  Do we have to have open borders?
[01:10:57.736 --> 01:10:59.157]  Am I really the bad man?
[01:10:59.177 --> 01:11:09.986]  And why am I, other than Ron Paul, but I'll go a lot further than Ron Paul goes, why does this have to be me?
[01:11:10.046 --> 01:11:11.027]  This is not fun!
[01:11:12.534 --> 01:11:25.884]  You know, for all of the COINTELPRO individuals who pose as patriots and attack me, and we've confirmed that in many cases, like Hal Turner and others, we know what's going on there, but so much of the other attacks I go through and the trolling, it's just jealousy!
[01:11:25.904 --> 01:11:36.752]  You know, all these people out there, when my listeners, not really Alex Jones, I understood the power of people and getting them to take action and getting them to make copies of films and put them on AXS TV.
[01:11:37.532 --> 01:11:44.074]  You know, I had read a lot of history books, so I read about the printing press, freeing Europe from the Dark Ages.
[01:11:44.114 --> 01:11:53.076]  And I read about the founding fathers of little handheld presses with one-page handbills, waking up the American people over the 15 years before the Revolutionary War.
[01:11:53.596 --> 01:11:56.137]  So I, day one, made films and said, make copies.
[01:11:56.237 --> 01:11:57.337]  You carried the ball.
[01:11:57.777 --> 01:12:00.178]  We've had a big effect on that front and other fronts.
[01:12:00.518 --> 01:12:03.879]  And now all these AM and FM stations that thought I was a kook 10 years ago,
[01:12:04.339 --> 01:12:05.840]  I've done more than 5,000 interviews.
[01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:10.722]  So I've done interviews on almost every talk station in the country over and over and over again.
[01:12:10.742 --> 01:12:15.683]  And I have radio executives and big radio hosts and others that call me and say, we thought you were a kook.
[01:12:15.983 --> 01:12:16.844]  It's all true.
[01:12:17.144 --> 01:12:18.724]  You know, my son's in the Marines.
[01:12:18.765 --> 01:12:20.465]  They're training for gun confiscation.
[01:12:21.185 --> 01:12:22.586]  My daughter's in the Army.
[01:12:22.886 --> 01:12:23.526]  Same thing.
[01:12:24.207 --> 01:12:25.487]  That's what they're scared of.
[01:12:25.947 --> 01:12:32.810]  Because we were here for so long telling people what was being set up that now it's openly
[01:12:33.630 --> 01:12:36.711]  Happening, and our credibility is rocketing upwards.
[01:12:38.112 --> 01:12:42.914]  But it's this audience that generated much of what is the modern patriot movement.
[01:12:42.934 --> 01:12:45.855]  I mean, I remember Ron Paul, and I didn't even really know this three years ago.
[01:12:46.635 --> 01:12:49.617]  He was on for an interview about three, four months into his campaign.
[01:12:49.657 --> 01:12:52.558]  He said, I just want to say on air, half of our support
[01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:57.482]  Half the people that come up to me and give me support are saying they came from your show.
[01:12:57.982 --> 01:13:01.564]  So Ron Paul, in the aggregate, is bigger than the work I've done.
[01:13:01.584 --> 01:13:03.225]  And that's wonderful.
[01:13:03.265 --> 01:13:05.706]  I'm glad there's bigger targets out there than me and he's a great man.
[01:13:06.167 --> 01:13:15.912]  But it's this audience from Texas and others that were a big part of the launch pad that propelled Ron Paul to where he is.
[01:13:15.952 --> 01:13:20.254]  And I told people at the time, you know, I off the record, many others pressured him to run.
[01:13:20.274 --> 01:13:21.935]  And I said, look, it doesn't matter if you don't win.
[01:13:23.166 --> 01:13:26.167]  It'll create a big movement, and you'll be able to talk about real issues.
[01:13:26.727 --> 01:13:29.108]  And he said, yeah, but then if we don't win, people will get mad.
[01:13:30.749 --> 01:13:32.049]  He understood that responsibility.
[01:13:32.109 --> 01:13:36.311]  But then I told listeners, when he didn't win the presidency, I said resistance was victory.
[01:13:36.731 --> 01:13:38.852]  Now look at how he's been mainstreamed.
[01:13:39.192 --> 01:13:42.013]  Now look at how they tried to destroy him, and they failed.
[01:13:42.593 --> 01:13:46.895]  So they're trying to act like they're his friend and spin what he's saying in the media.
[01:13:48.923 --> 01:13:50.626]  I hope to get to that point myself.
[01:13:50.867 --> 01:13:55.876]  I'm now at the testing point where they're saying that I'm calling for violence and I'm calling for killing cops.
[01:13:56.217 --> 01:14:00.244]  They're telling cops and military and IRS this to try to manipulate them.
[01:14:01.383 --> 01:14:01.523]  Yeah.
[01:14:21.547 --> 01:14:28.819]  You know, every day when I'm driving home, I've got to stop myself from pulling over and buying a six-pack of beer and going home and grilling a 20-ounce steak.
[01:14:28.879 --> 01:14:30.321]  I mean, you know, those are my vices.
[01:14:30.341 --> 01:14:32.765]  You know, every day I've got to...
[01:14:34.181 --> 01:14:38.345]  It's almost like a vice that I want to go fishing and do nothing but spend time with my children.
[01:14:38.765 --> 01:14:39.866]  But I know that's not a vice.
[01:14:39.886 --> 01:14:42.888]  That's why I'm going to be taking some more days off here in the future.
[01:14:43.429 --> 01:14:50.255]  Just because if I am going to get put in prison or if I am going to get killed, I just want to be with my children a little more, because every moment is precious.
[01:14:50.715 --> 01:15:00.724]  But then I was going to take my son fishing today, but then some radio and TV called that will reach millions of people, so I've got to show up tonight and tell him, sorry, we don't get to go fishing.
[01:15:01.244 --> 01:15:06.428]  And then I've got the government and the media lying, saying I'm telling people to kill cops.
[01:15:06.449 --> 01:15:07.489]  You know what that feels like?
[01:15:08.110 --> 01:15:10.632]  That I am sacrificing everything I am.
[01:15:10.712 --> 01:15:17.638]  I'm putting my entire body and my name, my family name, everything on the railroad tracks, folks, to stop this train.
[01:15:18.499 --> 01:15:18.619]  And...
[01:15:20.751 --> 01:15:23.274]  I get to see all these other so-called patriot leaders.
[01:15:23.855 --> 01:15:28.421]  I'm not mad that they're jealous and lie about me and attack me, and some of them are feds, but most of them aren't.
[01:15:29.001 --> 01:15:30.984]  I'm angry that they didn't become real leaders.
[01:15:31.645 --> 01:15:37.732]  I'm angry that they're involved in petty jealousy and envy.
[01:15:37.893 --> 01:15:39.194]  I'm upset for them!
[01:15:40.015 --> 01:15:45.061]  I'm upset that there's so many people I can't work with because they're morally bankrupt and mentally ill.
[01:15:45.521 --> 01:15:51.347]  I mean, I'm facing, you know, just a nightmare situation for myself individually.
[01:15:51.668 --> 01:15:54.291]  But also, the payoff is liberty and freedom.
[01:15:54.771 --> 01:16:00.577]  And I passed the point of no return a long time ago, and it feels good to be here telling the truth and taking action.
[01:16:00.617 --> 01:16:01.879]  In fact, I've got a 10-minute video
[01:16:02.339 --> 01:16:04.462]  up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:16:04.502 --> 01:16:05.424]  I shot yesterday.
[01:16:05.804 --> 01:16:14.156]  Let's put that on screen, just the video and video title, so people know what they're going to be looking for.
[01:16:15.245 --> 01:16:16.466]  It's up there on the screen.
[01:16:16.486 --> 01:16:17.927]  I told the guys to title it.
[01:16:17.947 --> 01:16:19.068]  They just got it up an hour ago.
[01:16:19.608 --> 01:16:24.151]  We're not going to have time to play it, but you can go to the website, Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to watch it.
[01:16:25.853 --> 01:16:28.174]  Alex Jones sets the record straight, reaches out to the military.
[01:16:28.194 --> 01:16:29.295]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:16:29.355 --> 01:16:31.336]  Alex Jones sets the record straight, reaches out to the military.
[01:16:31.356 --> 01:16:35.659]  That's just a 10-minute video that breaks a lot of this down and the state of the republic right now.
[01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:36.880]  But enough about myself.
[01:16:37.341 --> 01:16:42.384]  It's just that when James Traficant is saying, oh, you're having this big effect.
[01:16:42.444 --> 01:16:44.366]  I mean, he's not a guy that just says stuff.
[01:16:46.047 --> 01:16:47.068]  You're having a huge effect.
[01:16:47.088 --> 01:16:47.949]  You better watch it.
[01:16:48.330 --> 01:16:49.611]  You have a big responsibility.
[01:16:49.671 --> 01:16:51.513]  Believe me, it's like an echo chamber.
[01:16:51.873 --> 01:16:53.295]  This is what I'm thinking every minute.
[01:16:53.335 --> 01:16:54.976]  This is what I'm understanding every second.
[01:16:55.277 --> 01:17:00.962]  I wake up in the middle of the night and write down all these notes and all these ideas and things I want to talk about and never get to half of it.
[01:17:01.003 --> 01:17:03.665]  And I feel like I haven't done a good enough job.
[01:17:03.926 --> 01:17:04.306]  But you know what?
[01:17:04.326 --> 01:17:05.847]  I've done the best job I could.
[01:17:06.108 --> 01:17:06.869]  And God knows that.
[01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:10.111]  And look, this country is falling into pure evil.
[01:17:10.171 --> 01:17:11.512]  There is no doubt anymore.
[01:17:11.873 --> 01:17:13.374]  There's no denial about this.
[01:17:13.694 --> 01:17:14.935]  People have to get out of denial.
[01:17:14.955 --> 01:17:16.036]  Okay, I'm going to go to your calls quickly.
[01:17:16.056 --> 01:17:17.137]  I apologize for making you hold.
[01:17:17.437 --> 01:17:18.798]  Terry in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:17:18.818 --> 01:17:19.219]  Go ahead.
[01:17:20.139 --> 01:17:26.585]  Yeah, Alex, I've called you before, being an ex-vet and everything, and I listened to Glenn Beck.
[01:17:26.625 --> 01:17:28.906]  He was talking about the Black Robe Brigade.
[01:17:29.687 --> 01:17:31.969]  Now, I think that kind of gives you a hint of who I am.
[01:17:33.930 --> 01:17:36.853]  You know, with everything that's going on and the troops firing on
[01:17:37.501 --> 01:17:38.582]  American citizens.
[01:17:39.042 --> 01:17:44.125]  You know, one thing about it is, is this, you know, you can't understand why troops would do that.
[01:17:44.805 --> 01:17:52.349]  Even in Nam, one of the things was we knew we weren't there fighting for our country because if we were, we'd be doing it back here in the States.
[01:17:53.029 --> 01:18:01.514]  And what happened was, is we got the mentality that we were to, we were going to defend each other.
[01:18:01.714 --> 01:18:02.074]  Okay?
[01:18:02.494 --> 01:18:03.575]  It wasn't so much about
[01:18:04.068 --> 01:18:06.490]  You know, you enemy, me friend, that kind of thing.
[01:18:06.870 --> 01:18:10.613]  It was, we were going to do everything we could to protect ourselves.
[01:18:10.913 --> 01:18:20.960]  Well, you got the, you're going to have the same scenario when, if US troops come in to start, you know, shooting and things like that, American citizens.
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:22.581]  And I've thought about this.
[01:18:22.661 --> 01:18:23.782]  I've even prayed about this.
[01:18:23.842 --> 01:18:29.566]  And one of the things that keeps coming to my mind is, is I need to buy a bullhorn.
[01:18:29.626 --> 01:18:32.368]  And the reason I say that is, is this, you know,
[01:18:33.115 --> 01:18:46.141]  In those type of situations, if the troops realize, all you got to do is tell them over with a bullhorn, that, hey, your family is going through this exact same thing back home.
[01:18:46.221 --> 01:18:51.704]  Now, are you going to allow others to shoot your families like you're fixing to shoot us?
[01:18:52.364 --> 01:18:53.865]  And you know what?
[01:18:54.365 --> 01:18:57.707]  That's going to have somewhat of a wake-up call.
[01:18:58.127 --> 01:18:59.108]  Because you know what?
[01:18:59.868 --> 01:19:01.549]  I don't care how hardened you are.
[01:19:02.358 --> 01:19:05.221]  You know, by war, or how many tours of duty you have.
[01:19:05.981 --> 01:19:14.229]  You, when it comes to shooting a human being, you know, that, that takes a, that takes life out of you.
[01:19:14.710 --> 01:19:22.257]  And I know that for a fact, because it took me 12 years to finally realize that God would forgive me for what I did.
[01:19:23.561 --> 01:19:24.401]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:19:24.461 --> 01:19:50.934]  No, this is very touching what you're saying and that is the mentality and they're gonna stage attacks against the military and police to get them whipped up into a fury to go up against the population and then in the process we're all gonna kill each other which is exactly what these offshore bankers want instead of arresting Gordon Brown and Barack Obama and Lloyd Blankfein they're setting it up for us to kill each other like a bunch of idiots and I take no pleasure in thinking about
[01:19:51.474 --> 01:19:53.295]  What's going to happen to our military and police?
[01:19:53.855 --> 01:19:59.358]  Because if one out of one percent of the gun owners stands up in this fight, it's over for them.
[01:19:59.838 --> 01:20:01.719]  Hi, this is Steve Shank, eFoodsDirect.

[01:21:03.170 --> 01:21:06.953]  My name is Spann and I'm 68 years old and I live in Vermont.
[01:21:07.355 --> 01:21:11.818]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[01:21:12.098 --> 01:21:14.019]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[01:21:14.179 --> 01:21:15.500]  Made me feel breathless.
[01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:19.942]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.

[01:21:58.729 --> 01:22:02.011]  Jim Newcomer with Midas Resources, talking today about change.
[01:22:02.252 --> 01:22:07.435]  Not the change we were promised by President Obama, but the reality that we must face in these changing economic times.
[01:22:07.655 --> 01:22:13.019]  With our national debt currently exceeding $12.5 trillion, and our unfunded liabilities totaling over $107 trillion,
[01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:15.260]  The value of the U.S.
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:17.221]  dollar continues its slide into oblivion.
[01:22:17.381 --> 01:22:21.822]  There's still time to ensure your financial security with precious metals, but you need to act today.
[01:22:22.083 --> 01:22:31.065]  Call me, Jim Newcomer, at 800-686-2237, extension 104, and we can explore how MIDAS resources can help you secure your financial future.
[01:22:31.225 --> 01:22:35.847]  With our government continuing to find new ways to spend our money at the expense of our children and grandchildren,
[01:22:36.087 --> 01:22:39.490]  There's still time to acquire a true hedge against inflation with Precious Metals.
[01:22:39.711 --> 01:22:50.781]  Call me, Jim Newcomer, at 800-686-2237, extension 104, and we'll discuss how you can take physical possession or convert your IRA into Precious Metals before it's too late.
[01:22:50.801 --> 01:22:58.088]  800-686-2237, extension 104, and make the commitment today to retain the security you worked a lifetime to establish.
[01:23:01.128 --> 01:23:02.749]  You're subject to other police action.
[01:23:03.269 --> 01:23:04.229]  Tyranny is here.
[01:23:04.529 --> 01:23:08.191]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:23:08.411 --> 01:23:10.672]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:23:10.692 --> 01:23:16.114]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:23:16.554 --> 01:23:22.817]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:23:23.237 --> 01:23:28.780]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:32.902]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:23:33.402 --> 01:23:37.404]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:23:37.684 --> 01:23:43.267]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:23:43.607 --> 01:23:46.589]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:23:47.169 --> 01:23:48.570]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:23:49.150 --> 01:23:49.611]  It's here.

[01:24:09.184 --> 01:24:11.625]  All right, let's try to jam in as many of these callers as we can.
[01:24:11.645 --> 01:24:14.886]  Wayne Madsen's coming up with the key inside Intel on 9-11.
[01:24:15.246 --> 01:24:17.106]  Chris in Tennessee, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:24:17.126 --> 01:24:23.828]  Alex, I was proud of you when you bullhorned George Bush and they locked you up and took you for a two-hour ride.
[01:24:24.408 --> 01:24:32.571]  Also, guys like Kelly Russians and Charles in Louisiana, but what I was going to ask Mr. Jim Traficant was, I wrote him letters in prison.
[01:24:33.111 --> 01:24:37.252]  Jim was set up because his car that he rented
[01:24:37.856 --> 01:24:42.098]  He didn't want to drive a Pinto, and they set him up for excessive government funds.
[01:24:42.158 --> 01:24:52.464]  And also, on flight TWA800, he was the lead investigator, and one of our submarines in a training mission fired a missile.
[01:24:52.544 --> 01:24:54.445]  And that even came out later in mainstream news.
[01:24:54.525 --> 01:24:59.207]  I know, the more I research Trafficant, I mean, the guy was all over everything.
[01:24:59.547 --> 01:25:00.688]  I mean, how could he be bad?
[01:25:00.808 --> 01:25:05.811]  Why would he, if he was a crook, and we know they set him up, why would he always be out there exposing
[01:25:08.552 --> 01:25:28.589]  And with you with the inside stock trading and the history of the stock market in those particular days when there was 200 and something massive stock trades going on and then Larry Silverstein's, the Twin Towers were filled with asbestos.
[01:25:29.119 --> 01:25:47.210]  And the owners were afraid of massive lawsuits by the employees for asbestos, and he collected the... Anyway, let me get off this phone with somebody else here, but yeah, Alex, you have been right on cue for the last seven years, and that's an open murder case.
[01:25:47.971 --> 01:25:54.695]  Now, when the truth finally comes out, people, Alex, and Trafficant's right, be careful, you're the man.
[01:25:55.100 --> 01:26:06.271]  But what I'm getting at is when phonies like Glenn Beck who shed a tear, I would not let that man on Genesis Network when he gets fired.
[01:26:06.673 --> 01:26:09.054]  Because he's misleading everybody.
[01:26:09.414 --> 01:26:11.174]  And that to me, I despise the man.
[01:26:11.194 --> 01:26:12.735]  But Alex, you're the man.
[01:26:13.015 --> 01:26:14.295]  Well, listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:26:14.415 --> 01:26:16.876]  I don't want to sit here and just constantly talk about Glenn Beck all day.
[01:26:16.896 --> 01:26:19.777]  I mean, Glenn Beck is Glenn Beck and he'll be judged.
[01:26:19.837 --> 01:26:26.439]  And I mean, there's worse things in the universe than Glenn Beck, like Barack Obama.
[01:26:26.479 --> 01:26:29.540]  Let's go ahead and talk to Sean in California.
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:30.140]  You're on the air.
[01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:32.120]  Hey, Alex.
[01:26:32.140 --> 01:26:32.860]  Powerful show today.
[01:26:35.322 --> 01:26:35.862]  Two things.
[01:26:36.062 --> 01:26:39.083]  One is a news story that doesn't look like it's been picked up too much.
[01:26:39.103 --> 01:26:42.685]  It's called, We Tolerate the Cultivation of Opium Poppies.
[01:26:43.825 --> 01:26:45.346]  Something with Geraldo.
[01:26:45.706 --> 01:26:48.027]  Unbelievable that you just called in about that.
[01:26:48.427 --> 01:26:53.469]  I was just griping that we had that clip, we had the YouTube clip, and now we can't find it.
[01:26:54.049 --> 01:26:55.490]  What was the exact name of the clip?
[01:26:56.430 --> 01:26:58.071]  It's called, We Tolerate
[01:26:58.692 --> 01:27:01.315]  The cultivation of opium poppies.
[01:27:01.455 --> 01:27:02.176]  It's on YouTube.
[01:27:02.316 --> 01:27:06.540]  We cultivate the cultivation of opium poppies, YouTube.
[01:27:07.181 --> 01:27:10.064]  We cultivate the cultivation of poppies.
[01:27:10.665 --> 01:27:13.988]  The incredible part is, I was just searching for that.
[01:27:14.008 --> 01:27:15.570]  In fact, give me a document cam shot.
[01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:17.330]  There of this screen over here.
[01:27:17.730 --> 01:27:20.851]  I was searching during the break for it because the guys couldn't find it again.
[01:27:20.871 --> 01:27:25.392]  I had Fox News, Pentagon, Opium, and was unable to find it.
[01:27:25.452 --> 01:27:28.012]  But that is, that is synchronicity right there.
[01:27:28.472 --> 01:27:29.832]  That means we've got to play this clip.
[01:27:29.932 --> 01:27:30.573]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:27:30.593 --> 01:27:32.353]  No, absolutely, brother.
[01:27:33.153 --> 01:27:35.453]  We are changing the NSYNC with the Alex Jones Show.
[01:27:35.533 --> 01:27:38.814]  So, hey, so it's on YouTube.
[01:27:38.954 --> 01:27:43.555]  It's also, I sent it to writers at InfoWars, so it's got a little story already to go with it.
[01:27:45.290 --> 01:27:46.251]  But yeah, it's crazy.
[01:27:46.291 --> 01:27:52.895]  I mean, Harald is over here saying, oh yeah, for the security of our nation, we have to protect the poppy fields.
[01:27:53.435 --> 01:28:02.140]  And then they have these swollen military personnel over there going, yeah, we're guarding poppy fields, and it's a good thing.
[01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:02.841]  You know, that's huge.
[01:28:02.941 --> 01:28:05.823]  I've got to get Kurt Nemo and Paul Watson to do a blurb on that.
[01:28:06.403 --> 01:28:07.484]  They do such a great job.
[01:28:07.504 --> 01:28:08.504]  But I appreciate your call.
[01:28:08.824 --> 01:28:09.785]  We have got to cover this.
[01:28:09.825 --> 01:28:12.347]  For two days, I've been meaning to get to it.
[01:28:13.087 --> 01:28:19.311]  Also, guys, print the Reuters article, uh, NATO says no to Russia's call to eradicate poppies.
[01:28:19.671 --> 01:28:20.692]  And they admit it right there.
[01:28:20.712 --> 01:28:24.995]  And I heard it six months ago on BBC, where they admitted our government guards the poppies.
[01:28:25.435 --> 01:28:31.639]  And that's what Pat Tillman had discovered, was writing letters home to his family, that he was going to come back and expose it and was going to be anti-war.
[01:28:31.919 --> 01:28:32.940]  So they murdered him.
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:34.381]  And that's what I mean.
[01:28:34.481 --> 01:28:38.384]  They openly admit that they are shipping in the heroin.
[01:28:39.377 --> 01:28:43.439]  I mean, the banks are openly robbing everyone.
[01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:45.561]  This is just all out in the open.
[01:28:45.581 --> 01:28:49.283]  It is totally and completely out of control.
[01:28:49.343 --> 01:28:53.025]  Give people the name of the video one more time so they can find it.
[01:28:55.162 --> 01:28:56.203]  Okay, the caller is gone.
[01:28:56.604 --> 01:28:58.045]  But we were successful this time.
[01:28:58.546 --> 01:28:59.888]  We are successful with it.
[01:28:59.908 --> 01:29:02.170]  We are going to come out of break with it and then go to Wayne Madsen.
[01:29:02.551 --> 01:29:06.375]  We are going to do that here, and I'm going to get that Reuters article.
[01:29:07.237 --> 01:29:10.681]  Search term, NATO says no to Russian proposal.
[01:29:11.041 --> 01:29:12.982]  To eradicate poppies in Afghanistan.
[01:29:13.102 --> 01:29:14.644]  I believe that's almost the headline.
[01:29:15.084 --> 01:29:17.045]  We'll be able to find it, because I don't want to just show one clip.
[01:29:17.405 --> 01:29:30.354]  I want to show them even more evidence, where they now just roll it out, that okay, we're protecting it, okay, we're doing it, alright, we're the good guys, and if Alex Jones says opium being shipped in isn't good, well, he's al-Qaeda.
[01:29:30.375 --> 01:29:32.036]  You know, he's evil.
[01:29:32.076 --> 01:29:36.159]  Anybody else that says the CIA's shipping drugs in, they're evil, because that doesn't exist.
[01:29:36.179 --> 01:29:37.259]  But we do ship them in.
[01:29:37.279 --> 01:29:38.660]  You know, we do grow it.
[01:29:40.128 --> 01:29:44.333]  You know, there is a world government, but there isn't a world government, and you need to support it.
[01:29:44.773 --> 01:29:46.555]  Wayne Madsen, straight ahead, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:46.575 --> 01:29:47.276]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:47.796 --> 01:29:48.257]  Stay with us.
[01:29:49.979 --> 01:29:50.880]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:52.982]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.923 --> 01:29:56.606]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:59.753 --> 01:31:02.075]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:31:02.155 --> 01:31:04.356]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:31:04.456 --> 01:31:07.318]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:31:07.679 --> 01:31:12.422]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:31:12.782 --> 01:31:16.985]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:31:17.285 --> 01:31:19.646]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:31:19.746 --> 01:31:22.168]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:31:22.528 --> 01:31:25.089]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:33.034]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:31:33.374 --> 01:31:38.639]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:31:38.659 --> 01:31:41.042]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:31:41.082 --> 01:31:45.066]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:31:45.306 --> 01:31:46.207]  And I got news for you.
[01:31:46.387 --> 01:31:47.688]  You're everyone else.

[01:32:00.968 --> 01:32:02.009]  Massive unemployment.
[01:32:02.389 --> 01:32:03.170]  Endless wars.
[01:32:03.591 --> 01:32:04.832]  A new currency crisis.
[01:32:05.232 --> 01:32:06.974]  Financially and morally bankrupt.
[01:32:07.314 --> 01:32:09.176]  A great and terrible storm is approaching.
[01:32:09.476 --> 01:32:11.097]  So what's the best way to get ready?

[01:33:01.141 --> 01:33:02.562]  Welcome back to Fox and Friends.
[01:33:02.582 --> 01:33:05.005]  Dave Briggs, he's Clayton Morris, she's Allison Camerata.
[01:33:05.525 --> 01:33:07.206]  We're gonna head to Afghanistan this morning.
[01:33:07.247 --> 01:33:10.169]  One of the biggest obstacles in front of the U.S.
[01:33:10.209 --> 01:33:12.691]  troops there in Afghanistan is the opium trade.
[01:33:12.711 --> 01:33:16.014]  The Taliban is using it to intimidate the population.
[01:33:16.295 --> 01:33:19.097]  Joining us from Helmand Province is Geraldo Rivera.
[01:33:19.137 --> 01:33:21.259]  Good morning to you, Geraldo.
[01:33:21.299 --> 01:33:24.062]  Tell us what you've seen during your days there in Afghanistan.
[01:33:26.517 --> 01:33:27.958]  Hi, Allison, Dave, and Clayton.
[01:33:27.978 --> 01:33:36.944]  Yes, in some ways, the Marines brilliantly executed invasion of Marjah, this town in the middle of Helmand Province, was the easy part.
[01:33:37.384 --> 01:33:44.329]  The hard part now is governing this province, a province, as you suggest, that has become addicted to opium in many, many ways.
[01:33:44.609 --> 01:33:47.451]  That is the principal crop that is being grown here.
[01:33:48.031 --> 01:33:50.413]  The Taliban lend the farmers the money.
[01:33:50.793 --> 01:33:52.595]  They are indebted to the Taliban.
[01:33:52.855 --> 01:33:54.176]  They have to grow the opium.
[01:33:54.416 --> 01:34:04.804]  Now the Marines, in their success, are in a sense a victim of their success because now the population is, you know, they have these opium fields and we are tolerating it.
[01:34:04.864 --> 01:34:14.151]  We are tolerating the cultivation of the opium because we know that if we were to destroy it now, the population would turn against the Marines and it would be a real security risk.
[01:34:14.171 --> 01:34:14.732]  Let me introduce
[01:34:14.972 --> 01:34:19.174]  Lieutenant Colonel Brian Christmas, he's the commanding officer of the 3rd Battalion, 6th Marines.
[01:34:19.794 --> 01:34:22.155]  Really a wonderful group of Marines here.
[01:34:22.795 --> 01:34:26.377]  I know that you care deeply about this contradiction.
[01:34:26.417 --> 01:34:30.758]  The fact that here you have one of the best fighting forces in the world ever mounted.
[01:34:31.539 --> 01:34:35.040]  And in a sense, you're watching as this opium is being grown.
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:36.881]  I know it grinds at your gut.
[01:34:37.601 --> 01:34:38.502]  How do you deal with it?
[01:34:38.662 --> 01:34:39.442]  What are you doing about it?
[01:34:39.802 --> 01:34:42.023]  Well, frankly, this is a part of their culture.
[01:34:42.063 --> 01:34:45.083]  So, while it might grind in my gut, it's what they do.
[01:34:46.123 --> 01:34:50.424]  We provide them security, we're providing them resources, and we're providing them alternatives.
[01:34:50.464 --> 01:34:52.925]  And the alternatives are different crops to grow.
[01:34:52.945 --> 01:34:54.725]  They're getting the seed and the fertilizer to do it.
[01:34:55.625 --> 01:34:58.246]  They can rotate any of their crops that they want.
[01:34:58.286 --> 01:35:02.167]  If they want to get rid of their wheat and grow cotton for the winter, they can do that, and we're going to help them do it.
[01:35:02.187 --> 01:35:03.267]  So the same thing goes for the cotton.
[01:35:03.767 --> 01:35:08.591]  So you think that, you know, we were at the market and everywhere we go they're selling these little devices.
[01:35:08.631 --> 01:35:09.391]  Take a shot of this, Greg.
[01:35:10.092 --> 01:35:11.353]  They're hand carved.
[01:35:11.413 --> 01:35:17.257]  These are the little devices they use to scrape the opium sap off the plant.
[01:35:17.577 --> 01:35:22.401]  And I watched as you bought every one that was for sale because you care so deeply.
[01:35:22.441 --> 01:35:23.402]  Why'd you do that?
[01:35:23.442 --> 01:35:24.242]  Well, I'm off the street.
[01:35:24.282 --> 01:35:26.624]  The idea is that we don't want to harvest the poppy.
[01:35:28.493 --> 01:35:30.114]  Do you see that mind control?
[01:35:30.134 --> 01:35:37.416]  The troops help them grow the poppies, but then they get the paraphernalia off the streets.
[01:35:37.436 --> 01:35:38.577]  That's a psy-op.
[01:35:39.097 --> 01:35:43.239]  That's saying, yes, we help grow it, but then we're going to arrest you if you have it.
[01:35:45.019 --> 01:35:46.440]  But then on the street it's bad.
[01:35:47.940 --> 01:35:50.181]  Opium production was almost down to zero.
[01:35:50.441 --> 01:35:56.364]  Now over 91 percent, you can just Google that, of all the opium in the world that creates heroin,
[01:35:57.504 --> 01:35:58.965]  It comes out of Afghanistan.
[01:36:00.206 --> 01:36:06.149]  The news has reported a 12-plus, that number's over a year old, increase to record numbers.
[01:36:06.749 --> 01:36:13.093]  The Russians last month, NATO rejects Russian call for Afghan poppy spraying, said, no, we're going to let it be grown.
[01:36:13.113 --> 01:36:15.515]  This has nothing to do with the, quote, Taliban.
[01:36:15.895 --> 01:36:16.595]  We're there.
[01:36:16.715 --> 01:36:22.879]  One of the main reasons is to get the hundreds of billions of dollars a year of opium laundered through US banks.
[01:36:23.379 --> 01:36:27.161]  And of course I've been on air for eight years exposing this, but this is mind control.
[01:36:27.201 --> 01:36:29.642]  This is the normalization of pure evil.
[01:36:29.662 --> 01:36:34.564]  Because Pat Tillman was writing letters home saying they're growing opium, we're protecting it, this war is a fraud.
[01:36:34.824 --> 01:36:36.585]  Back when that was a secret, they had to kill him.
[01:36:37.065 --> 01:36:39.507]  Now because they can't cover it up, they just normalize it.
[01:36:39.807 --> 01:36:40.487]  Hide it in plain view.
[01:36:40.767 --> 01:36:42.248]  Yes, we're helping them grow it.
[01:36:42.528 --> 01:36:45.109]  We don't like it, but we've got to defeat Al-Qaeda.
[01:36:46.110 --> 01:36:48.551]  Now, let your kid be caught with some heroin.
[01:36:49.724 --> 01:36:53.387]  Of course, it wouldn't be here if there wasn't so much money in it, and if our government wasn't growing it.
[01:36:53.868 --> 01:36:54.749]  Just like Mexico.
[01:36:54.929 --> 01:36:57.431]  Our government is criminal and brings in most of the drugs.
[01:36:58.392 --> 01:37:03.256]  Now, I want to go to Wayne Madsen, DC-based investigative journalist, author, and syndicated columnist.
[01:37:03.917 --> 01:37:07.080]  He's appeared all over CNN, Fox, CBS, PBS.
[01:37:07.741 --> 01:37:12.545]  He worked for the National Security Agency, worked for Naval Encryption.
[01:37:14.537 --> 01:37:20.359]  He worked for the Department of State, the Data Automation Command, National Security Agency, on and on and on.
[01:37:20.799 --> 01:37:25.601]  He's here to break some major 9-11 truth news, but he's also exposed government narcotics trafficking.
[01:37:25.981 --> 01:37:26.961]  So let's cover that first.
[01:37:27.041 --> 01:37:29.062]  Wayne Madsen of waymadsenreport.com.
[01:37:31.523 --> 01:37:38.205]  Do you agree with me that this is just the main lining of the double-think of the mind control, because they can't hide it anymore?
[01:37:38.465 --> 01:37:42.026]  That okay, we're growing it, but we're doing it to fight Al-Qaeda.
[01:37:42.893 --> 01:37:52.875]  Oh absolutely, and it's not just, now we have reports from the United Nations that it's not just heroin and opium coming out of Afghanistan, but it's cannabis.
[01:37:53.495 --> 01:37:57.396]  So they've actually found a new cash crop to deal in.
[01:37:57.476 --> 01:38:05.077]  And you heard them, the troops help grow it, and so our men and women are now farmers for the CIA.
[01:38:06.157 --> 01:38:09.018]  That's right, and the biggest problem is, where is this
[01:38:09.859 --> 01:38:11.661]  I had one going to it.
[01:38:11.781 --> 01:38:17.967]  It's getting across the border into Tajikistan to the north and winding up on the old Silk Road.
[01:38:18.447 --> 01:38:22.971]  The Silk Road, it's going east into China and west into Europe.
[01:38:22.991 --> 01:38:30.918]  And, of course, the Russian government and the Chinese government are well aware of the fact that this stuff is coming out of Afghanistan.
[01:38:30.958 --> 01:38:33.140]  And who's involved in this illicit trade?
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:34.121]  You've got Karzai.
[01:38:34.181 --> 01:38:36.023]  Hamid Karzai's brother is one of the biggest
[01:38:36.543 --> 01:38:38.465]  Drug warlords in Afghanistan.
[01:38:38.525 --> 01:38:39.725]  Oh, let me stop you again.
[01:38:39.805 --> 01:38:42.647]  New York Times just admits the whole thing.
[01:38:43.108 --> 01:38:43.948]  Right here, U.S.
[01:38:43.988 --> 01:38:46.010]  turns blind eye to opium in Afghanistan.
[01:38:46.150 --> 01:38:47.411]  They're not turning blind eye.
[01:38:47.651 --> 01:38:48.952]  They're right there getting the goodies.
[01:38:48.992 --> 01:38:49.472]  Go ahead.
[01:38:49.913 --> 01:38:50.153]  Right.
[01:38:50.253 --> 01:38:56.117]  And the biggest fear of China is that they're looking at this as another opium war.
[01:38:56.137 --> 01:39:03.002]  You know, we already have reports coming out of Yunnan province in China that young men are getting hooked on this stuff.
[01:39:03.562 --> 01:39:08.446]  They know where it's coming out of, and frankly, they're not happy about it.
[01:39:08.606 --> 01:39:20.815]  And the history of the Opium Wars with the British and China, they understand that that's what helped defeat the Chinese before, and they're worried that the West has similar designs now.
[01:39:23.715 --> 01:39:24.756]  Well, that's important.
[01:39:24.796 --> 01:39:26.157]  I mean, this is a British model.
[01:39:26.197 --> 01:39:33.044]  Skull and Bones that set up our CIA on record was a British model to use a drug war to take over the U.S.
[01:39:33.084 --> 01:39:37.388]  because they'd already done it a hundred years before in China with the Opium War.
[01:39:37.428 --> 01:39:38.589]  That's how they corrupted the police.
[01:39:38.949 --> 01:39:40.351]  That's how they took over the society.
[01:39:41.249 --> 01:40:08.802]  Right, and we also know that the route to the West, to Europe, it goes through Turkey, and what we're seeing now with the present Turkish government uncovering this deep state that has existed in Turkey for a number of years, that part and parcel of that deep state, it's called the Ergenekon Network, is the trafficking in opium, and the opium's coming by land from Afghanistan.
[01:40:10.626 --> 01:40:10.966]  Continue.
[01:40:10.986 --> 01:40:11.046]  Now,
[01:40:36.235 --> 01:40:43.186]  Government drug dealing, white slavery running, kidnapping, all of it takes us back full circle to 9-11.
[01:40:43.427 --> 01:40:49.817]  Sybil Edmonds, FBI, NSA translator, she's now been able to finally break her gag order in court.
[01:40:50.822 --> 01:41:12.183]  Last year, she told Congress this, behind the scenes, they put a gag order on her, that she was listening to the Taliban and Al Qaeda senior leadership, including Osama bin Laden, running slaves, running drugs, running weapons, all over the Middle East and Central Asia, under direct command of the Central
[01:41:13.144 --> 01:41:16.305]  intelligence agency, even to the day of 9-11.
[01:41:16.785 --> 01:41:38.251]  She was hearing this on the day of 9-11, and then now the Turkish government has discovered that they have a military deep state, just like we have a deep state system here, and before we get into this new 9-11 information you're dropping on folks, and I've done the research, everything you put in this report ties into separate public info, but it's devastating
[01:41:39.437 --> 01:41:46.620]  We now have confirmed Army drill manuals where they're training to take on tea parties, gun owners, and returning veterans.
[01:41:46.700 --> 01:41:49.562]  Much worse than the MIAC and Homeland Security report in there.
[01:41:49.722 --> 01:41:51.903]  It's the biggest troop training we've ever seen.
[01:41:51.923 --> 01:41:53.283]  This has been going on for decades.
[01:41:53.303 --> 01:41:56.685]  This is a total training op to prepare for martial law.
[01:41:58.191 --> 01:42:18.962]  Well, that's right, and a lot of this goes back to the 1980s when we had Rex 84 cobbled together by Oliver North and his chums on basically just taking everybody into custody who didn't agree with the Reagan administration and putting them into facilities, detention facilities.
[01:42:19.403 --> 01:42:26.747]  This is an old plan come back to haunt us decades later.
[01:42:27.583 --> 01:42:33.967]  Again, Wayne Madsen, so many times when I'm watching C-SPAN and watching a national security hearing, you see him there in the background reporting.
[01:42:33.987 --> 01:42:36.108]  You have amazing sources in D.C.
[01:42:36.548 --> 01:42:48.616]  The headline at WayneMadsenReport.com, it's also an online journal, and InfoWars.com, the super classified network that served as command and control for 9-11 false flag attack.
[01:42:48.976 --> 01:42:52.038]  Break it down for our audience, this incredible information.
[01:42:52.738 --> 01:43:00.826]  Okay, what I gathered was that there was a very highly classified system with a limited number of people now.
[01:43:01.326 --> 01:43:09.794]  You know, it didn't take a lot of people to, you know, be in charge of this command and control operation because all it entailed that day was
[01:43:10.554 --> 01:43:22.940]  Letting people know, certain people know this is not a training drill, this is real time, and take the necessary actions to carry out the attacks.
[01:43:23.822 --> 01:43:30.568]  The system, I first heard the phonetic description of the system called PDAS, P-D-A-S.
[01:43:31.128 --> 01:43:36.653]  And I didn't find out what it stood for until a few days later.
[01:43:36.693 --> 01:43:41.737]  And what I've gathered is that the system stands for Planning and Decision Aid System.
[01:43:42.137 --> 01:43:46.080]  There's only about 75 to 100 terminals throughout the U.S.
[01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:46.560]  government.
[01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:49.502]  Maybe a couple hundred people have access to this.
[01:43:49.582 --> 01:44:01.069]  They all have what's known as top-secret special compartment, sensitive compartment information, clearances, special access program clearances.
[01:44:01.649 --> 01:44:09.253]  And this was the system, I do know one message was transmitted from the Chief of Staff of the Air Force on the morning of 9-11.
[01:44:10.594 --> 01:44:21.018]  Uh, two other terminals, PDAS terminals, that basically stated the Air Force has successfully intercepted the target over Pennsylvania.
[01:44:21.558 --> 01:44:28.941]  Now, whether that was Flight 93, I don't know, but that certainly corresponds with similar
[01:44:29.501 --> 01:44:39.006]  Uh, stories about, uh, what happened, uh, with the, uh, target that was moving in on the, uh, on Washington, D.C., uh, where Cheney is sitting there with Mineta.
[01:44:39.346 --> 01:44:44.729]  Mineta says, uh, Cheney, uh, a young enlisted man came in and said, does the order still stand?
[01:44:45.210 --> 01:44:47.831]  And, uh, Cheney responded, of course the order still stands.
[01:44:47.871 --> 01:44:49.332]  Have you heard anything to the contrary?
[01:44:49.352 --> 01:44:55.135]  Uh, it's quite apparent that it was PEDAS, which is operated under the Secretary of Defense.
[01:44:55.876 --> 01:45:01.944]  This was the system that was used to provide the alternate command and control system on 9-11.
[01:45:02.285 --> 01:45:11.197]  And again, this corresponds with another system called the CritiCom system, run by the NSA, where a similar message came over that morning.
[01:45:11.257 --> 01:45:32.592]  And is that why even Anderson Cooper and CNN and CBS confirm doomsday planes from before the attack and after were all videotaped at about 50,000 feet circling because it's this doomsday COG deep state emergency dictatorship system that they were using to run the attack?
[01:45:33.208 --> 01:45:44.584]  Yes, well the National Emergency Airborne Command Post, as you call it, Doomsday Plane, where the Joint Chiefs of Staff goes in the event of a nuclear war, does have a PDAS terminal on board that aircraft.
[01:45:44.604 --> 01:45:48.810]  So, obviously, it was very much instrumental in this whole operation.
[01:45:49.290 --> 01:45:50.471]  Yes, we are.
[01:46:08.101 --> 01:46:14.005]  Very highly classified intelligence systems that morning, talking about the interception of a target over Pennsylvania.
[01:46:14.365 --> 01:46:31.196]  So the whole thing about the cell phone calls, you know, the passengers storming the cockpit, all obviously a major, a major psy-op ruse to try to convince people that, you know, some guy said, let's roll.
[01:46:31.636 --> 01:46:56.047]  Well, former Black Ops Commander Colonel Don DeGramperie, when he was dying on the verge of heart failure, came on our show and then died a few weeks later and said, look, I've talked to all the Pentagon boys, and this was right after 9-11, and he said, the Pentagon, a separate general based in Virginia, but it was the squadron out of North Dakota, the Happy Hooligans, they put two AIM-9s into that aircraft
[01:46:56.767 --> 01:46:57.968]  And that they bucked the order.
[01:46:57.988 --> 01:47:14.179]  And we know, this is declassified, we have the document, two and a half months before 9-11, Cheney took the NORAD shoot-down power that generals always had as a default, they didn't need to have a president or vice president tell them, and took that power only unto himself.
[01:47:14.499 --> 01:47:21.063]  They put a whole new command structure in, in the week before the 9-11, so they'd be confused and not know what was going on.
[01:47:21.083 --> 01:47:26.107]  And then right after 9-11, Cheney gave the shoot-down power back to NORAD.
[01:47:27.407 --> 01:47:30.848]  Well, I also think it's significant that this p.d.a.s.
[01:47:30.888 --> 01:47:44.632]  message that was sent by the Air Force Chief of Staff was sent by General John Jumper, who had only assumed command of the Air Force on September 6, 2001, so five days before we have a new Air Force Chief of Staff.
[01:47:45.052 --> 01:47:51.014]  And I think what this is telling me is that it seems like it's the Air Force
[01:47:51.614 --> 01:48:03.118]  Because we know that in 2007, again, it was the Cheney's alternate chain of command moved these nuclear-tipped cruise missiles out of Minot Air Force Base to Barksdale Air Force Base.
[01:48:03.138 --> 01:48:04.378]  They said it was a big mistake.
[01:48:04.758 --> 01:48:06.259]  But again, here we have the Air Force.
[01:48:06.299 --> 01:48:07.479]  The Air Force seems to come up
[01:48:07.959 --> 01:48:08.980]  Time and time again.
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:17.990]  And we have people in the Air Force, I think, who really represent the alternate chain of command as we saw it under the Bush administration.
[01:48:18.451 --> 01:48:24.177]  And of course, 9-11 was an aerial attack, so which service would they have had to co-op?
[01:48:24.678 --> 01:48:25.358]  It would have been the U.S.
[01:48:25.459 --> 01:48:25.759]  Air Force.
[01:48:26.247 --> 01:48:29.769]  And who are experts in drone attacks and remote control?
[01:48:30.389 --> 01:48:45.095]  Look, you don't like to speculate, but from your years of deep research and working at the NSA and literally living a cloak-and-dagger lifestyle in D.C., as best you can tell, I mean, clearly it's Cheney running the attack, but how did this work that day?
[01:48:45.990 --> 01:48:54.557]  Well, apparently what happened was, we know that there was this huge amount of confusion about some drills that were being run.
[01:48:54.617 --> 01:49:03.984]  NORAD was running drills, there were other drills being run, and there was a lot of confusion among the people at the radar scopes at the computer terminals.
[01:49:04.485 --> 01:49:09.588]  They said they were watching television, and they said, wait a minute, is this drill or is this real time?
[01:49:09.629 --> 01:49:11.330]  And I think the purpose of this alternate
[01:49:11.730 --> 01:49:15.594]  Command and Control System was to confuse the situation.
[01:49:18.677 --> 01:49:25.863]  You know, when you had people that didn't know whether what they were watching on TV was part of a drill or not, I think it was very successful.
[01:49:26.264 --> 01:49:35.192]  So the knowledge of what was really happening only had to be amongst the very few people because even the people who might have been on the PDAS terminals
[01:49:35.772 --> 01:49:43.598]  I'm getting this information wouldn't have had the big picture only certain a certain number of people would have had the big picture and would have known what was going on that morning.
[01:49:44.919 --> 01:49:55.067]  And of course there was a separate CIA drill of the Pentagon being attacked being run separately that way if they got caught by other branches of the government or other compartments they'd say oh it's just a drill.
[01:49:55.982 --> 01:49:57.063]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:49:57.123 --> 01:49:59.886]  So you had that built-in factor of confusion.
[01:49:59.906 --> 01:50:04.510]  You had a certain number of people, a very limited number of people, who knew exactly what was going on.
[01:50:05.010 --> 01:50:21.344]  And therefore, that's how this multi-trillion dollar command and control communications and intelligence system that we had to, you know, ostensibly fight the Soviet Union during that Cold War era, it collapsed in a matter of hours on the morning of 9-11.
[01:50:22.392 --> 01:50:36.290]  And we know within 10 minutes, as the Associated Press reported, Rumsfeld began broadcasting across the Pentagon, Iraq did this, because he knew it was important to get that first story out, Iraq, because they were already gearing up to go into Iraq.
[01:50:36.310 --> 01:50:37.371]  Let's come back and talk about
[01:50:37.972 --> 01:50:41.715]  How important this information is and how we get this out of the public.
[01:50:42.016 --> 01:50:43.457]  WayneMadsenReport.com.

[01:50:53.106 --> 01:50:55.108]  Wayne Madsen is joining us.
[01:50:55.148 --> 01:50:55.868]  We'll be right back.

[01:52:23.571 --> 01:52:29.116]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:52:29.516 --> 01:52:33.219]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.

[01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:48.911]  The police state isn't coming.

[01:54:13.539 --> 01:54:21.810]  We were just talking about how the troops are on Fox News saying they helped the Afghans grow the opium and it's come out the contractors are shipping the heroin out.
[01:54:22.010 --> 01:54:25.574]  I mean, if they can get on the news and admit they're growing the opium...
[01:54:26.738 --> 01:54:28.259]  But say it's to fight Al-Qaeda.
[01:54:29.019 --> 01:54:31.000]  They can take your pension funds, everything else.
[01:54:31.140 --> 01:54:32.120]  And they are going to.
[01:54:32.160 --> 01:54:32.841]  They're announcing it.
[01:54:33.601 --> 01:54:37.423]  Wayne Madsen, we were talking during the break, and I said, what's most important in the last few minutes to talk about?
[01:54:37.443 --> 01:54:48.487]  And you said, well, they're trying to persecute journalists now, especially journalists that are getting NSA leaks about illegal spying, because if they can pick off top journalists, they can get anybody.
[01:54:48.507 --> 01:54:50.868]  And you talked about Cass Sunstein.
[01:54:51.369 --> 01:54:51.969]  Talk more about that.
[01:54:52.745 --> 01:55:02.348]  Well, I think what we see with this administration is, in some ways, it's worse than the Bush administration when it comes to violation of First Amendment rights.
[01:55:02.408 --> 01:55:15.152]  We now know today that on Monday, Jim Risen of the New York Times was served a subpoena to go before a grand jury and reveal who his sources were.
[01:55:15.232 --> 01:55:22.354]  Now, say this is about Chapter 9 in the book he wrote, which has to do with the CIA, but he also broke the story
[01:55:23.234 --> 01:55:28.058]  Uh, or help to break the story on the warrantless wiretapping program at NSA.
[01:55:28.138 --> 01:55:45.790]  And I do know that the indictment of Tom Drake, the ex-senior official at NSA a few weeks ago, is part of a Justice Department NSA program to haul journalists before grand juries to get them to reveal who their sources are.
[01:55:46.591 --> 01:55:48.592]  Now even Bush didn't even think about going this way.
[01:55:48.652 --> 01:56:01.060]  Well, how could an NSA official, who's obviously trying to be patriotic so he releases illegal activity because he didn't want to go to jail, how does he get indicted and thrown in prison for doing, for exposing illegal activity?
[01:56:01.821 --> 01:56:03.702]  Well, you know, it wasn't only that.
[01:56:04.122 --> 01:56:08.385]  Apparently there's been a lot of contract, multi-billion dollar contract fraud at NSA.
[01:56:08.445 --> 01:56:10.787]  Now look at, this gets into Keaton cases.
[01:56:11.187 --> 01:56:14.269]  I think what the government did with Tom Drake was, it was preemptive.
[01:56:14.609 --> 01:56:17.431]  Let's indict him before he can bring a Keaton case.
[01:56:17.971 --> 01:56:31.967]  Uh, showing that the government, uh, Michael Hayden, when he was direct, uh, director of the NSA, and the present director, General Alexander, Keith Alexander, both engaged in multi-billion dollar contracts throughout the line of pockets of their favorite contractors.
[01:56:32.047 --> 01:56:37.894]  And they're all the usual suspects, the SAICs, the Booz Allens, Computer Science Corporation, and the rest.
[01:56:39.034 --> 01:56:41.375]  And this is hardball.
[01:56:41.415 --> 01:56:44.476]  Now the hardball is being played Nixon-style.
[01:56:45.537 --> 01:56:47.157]  I mean, I say this about Obama.
[01:56:47.518 --> 01:56:51.859]  He's not a moron like George Bush, but he's every bit of a liar as Richard Nixon.
[01:56:52.399 --> 01:56:58.642]  And I think we're seeing more Barack Milhouse Obama here than anything else.
[01:57:00.202 --> 01:57:02.183]  Yeah, I mean, people thought Bush was bad.
[01:57:02.223 --> 01:57:06.765]  I mean, clearly... It's continuing.
[01:57:07.921 --> 01:57:10.002]  Clearly, it's all coming to a head right now.
[01:57:10.483 --> 01:57:11.643]  What about the Tea Parties?
[01:57:11.943 --> 01:57:17.146]  These Army documents we're getting, where they are training to just mow Tea Parties down and take them to FEMA camps.
[01:57:18.007 --> 01:57:21.069]  Well, you know, I look at the Tea Party and I see a lot of anger.
[01:57:21.229 --> 01:57:23.730]  I see a lot of built-in energy and frustration.
[01:57:24.190 --> 01:57:32.895]  Unfortunately, I was here when Dick Ormey was at the Press Club, and he ostensibly is, like, marshalling the Tea Party movement.
[01:57:32.915 --> 01:57:37.038]  And I think the Tea Party has to be very careful about being used as dupes by the Republican Party.
[01:57:37.954 --> 01:57:46.840]  All that anger, all that frustration, I think, should be channeled away from the Republican Party and to the mass protesters.
[01:57:46.860 --> 01:57:50.202]  Sure, but if they can't co-opt it, I mean, they're training the army that it's the enemy.
[01:57:50.242 --> 01:57:50.983]  That's outrageous.
[01:57:51.704 --> 01:57:55.008]  Oh, absolutely, and we've seen this happen before.
[01:57:55.708 --> 01:58:01.074]  We saw it happen in the 80s when people were opposed to U.S.
[01:58:01.154 --> 01:58:02.656]  intervention in Central America.
[01:58:02.676 --> 01:58:12.226]  We had anti-intervention groups being infiltrated by the CIA, FBI, and others, and we're seeing a replay of that.
[01:58:12.648 --> 01:58:15.209]  Man, but it's on such a huge scale.
[01:58:15.249 --> 01:58:18.190]  I mean, the government is just so rotten and evil.
[01:58:18.830 --> 01:58:22.512]  And now announcing it's going to take your pension funds, but that's the patriotic thing to do.
[01:58:22.812 --> 01:58:24.532]  Here, Goldman Sachs, here's all my money.

[01:58:49.903 --> 01:58:52.525]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:58:52.925 --> 01:58:57.907]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:58:58.248 --> 01:58:59.988]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:59:00.309 --> 01:59:05.131]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:59:05.291 --> 01:59:06.271]  How much do you want?
[01:59:06.492 --> 01:59:07.212]  When do you want it?
[01:59:07.592 --> 01:59:09.193]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:59:09.473 --> 01:59:10.313]  When will you need it?
[01:59:10.553 --> 01:59:12.614]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:59:12.754 --> 01:59:13.854]  Will there be any food?
[01:59:14.095 --> 01:59:15.435]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:59:15.615 --> 01:59:20.697]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:59:20.897 --> 01:59:24.078]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:59:24.479 --> 01:59:27.940]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:59:28.280 --> 01:59:29.281]  How much will you need?
[01:59:29.501 --> 01:59:30.141]  We don't know.
[01:59:30.421 --> 01:59:31.322]  How much do you want?
[01:59:31.522 --> 01:59:32.242]  All you can get.
[01:59:32.462 --> 01:59:33.303]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:59:33.543 --> 01:59:36.304]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
