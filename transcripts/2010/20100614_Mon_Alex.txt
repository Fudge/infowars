[00:00:04.974 --> 00:00:06.274]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.274 --> 00:00:08.056]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.056 --> 00:00:09.817]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.817 --> 00:00:11.398]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.398 --> 00:00:12.939]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:17.142]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:21.205]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.567 --> 00:00:26.769]  It's Monday, June the 14th, 2010.
[00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.030]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:39.835]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson, the editor and writer for PrisonPlanet.com, sitting in for Alex while he's out of town working on a project.
[00:00:39.835 --> 00:00:48.440]  And we're gonna go to your calls at the bottom of the hour, so get lined up on the boards and we'll get to you in the second half of this first hour.
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.300]  In the
[00:00:52.196 --> 00:00:56.639]  Aftermath of my sitting in the three hours after I finish here.
[00:00:56.639 --> 00:01:07.167]  We've got a compilation of outstanding interviews, which Alex has done over the past couple of weeks, including Jesse Ventura and Alan Hart.
[00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:11.230]  So be sure to stay tuned for that if you missed it the first time around.
[00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:40.893]  Now, in anticipation of Chris Matthews and MSNBC airing this huge hit piece on Wednesday night at 7pm Eastern Time, The Rise of the New Right, we're going to take an in-depth look at how, while smearing peaceful grassroots American citizens and anti-big government protesters, anti-bailout protesters, as domestic terrorists and racist radicals,
[00:01:41.973 --> 00:01:51.061]  Simply for opposing the growth of big government and being vocal about it and the tyranny that comes with it.
[00:01:51.061 --> 00:02:08.915]  Matthews has concurrently been running defence for a real domestic terrorist and the man who helped launch Barack Obama, Barry Sotero's political career in his living room, I refer of course to Bill Ayres, former leader
[00:02:09.415 --> 00:02:24.910]  of the violent communist revolutionary terrorist organization the Weather Underground, a group that carried out bombings against government buildings, the State Department, the Pentagon, the Capitol building, to name but three.
[00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.874]  And this demonization of grassroots political activists is
[00:02:30.782 --> 00:02:50.995]  Well, in reality, while the MSNBC and the corporate media are saying that there's this new frontier of hate and that there's this violent extremism that is coming from the quote, right-wingers, in reality the only violence is coming from zealous Obama supporters, the Obamanoids.
[00:02:52.236 --> 00:03:04.928]  And this ties into a big story that's doing the rounds today, which comes from biggovernment.com, and we'll be posting this very shortly on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:03:04.928 --> 00:03:08.712]  And this is Democrat Congressman Bob Etheridge.
[00:03:09.312 --> 00:03:19.720]  Assaulting students who ask him merely if he supports the Obama agenda after a Nancy Pelosi event at which she was speaking.
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:26.284]  So we'll play this clip now for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and radio listeners will be able to hear it too.
[00:03:26.284 --> 00:03:31.088]  So we go to this clip of Bob Etheridge.
[00:03:31.088 --> 00:03:33.349]  Hi, Congressman.
[00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.710]  How are you?
[00:03:39.147 --> 00:03:42.653]  Do you fully support the Obama agenda?
[00:03:42.653 --> 00:03:44.956]  Who are you?
[00:03:44.956 --> 00:03:47.060]  Who are you?
[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.601]  Who are you?
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.444]  So, the clip continues after that.
[00:03:55.444 --> 00:03:58.867]  Perhaps we'll play the full clip later, but it's only a minute long.
[00:03:58.867 --> 00:04:05.273]  And it's basically this congressman, he's walking down the street, you'll be able to see it on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:05.273 --> 00:04:10.098]  These student reporters ask him if he supports the Obama agenda.
[00:04:10.098 --> 00:04:13.981]  And he immediately starts assaulting them, assaulting their camera.
[00:04:13.981 --> 00:04:16.244]  He actually grabs one of them round the neck.
[00:04:16.784 --> 00:04:20.486]  And goes into a kind of mini half Nelson on him.
[00:04:20.486 --> 00:04:24.468]  And then he obviously repeats this moronic, zombified statement.
[00:04:24.468 --> 00:04:25.108]  Who are you?
[00:04:25.108 --> 00:04:26.349]  Who are you?
[00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:39.496]  So it's yet another example of, you know, while the mainstream media criticizes any opposition to the government as a new frontier of violent extremism, the only violence is coming from pro-Obama goons like this congressman.
[00:04:39.916 --> 00:04:48.361]  And Obama's own supporters, so we'll be back after the break to delve into that further on the Alex Jones Show with me, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:04:48.361 --> 00:04:48.881]  Stay tuned!
[00:05:00.973 --> 00:05:07.418]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.

[00:06:10.084 --> 00:06:17.485]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:06:17.485 --> 00:06:22.346]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:06:31.012 --> 00:06:34.737]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:06:35.276 --> 00:06:42.043]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:06:42.043 --> 00:06:45.946]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[00:06:52.313 --> 00:06:53.293]  Thank you.
[00:07:00.595 --> 00:07:03.596]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:07:03.596 --> 00:07:08.937]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:07:08.937 --> 00:07:10.978]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:07:10.978 --> 00:07:15.979]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:17.160]  How much do you want?
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:17.900]  When do you want it?
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.161]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:07:20.161 --> 00:07:21.242]  When will you need it?
[00:07:21.242 --> 00:07:23.443]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:24.784]  Will there be any food?
[00:07:24.784 --> 00:07:26.304]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:07:26.304 --> 00:07:31.567]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:07:31.567 --> 00:07:34.709]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:07:35.149 --> 00:07:38.971]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:07:38.971 --> 00:07:40.211]  How much will you need?
[00:07:40.211 --> 00:07:41.112]  We don't know.
[00:07:41.112 --> 00:07:42.212]  How much do you want?
[00:07:42.212 --> 00:07:43.132]  All you can get.
[00:07:43.132 --> 00:07:44.233]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:07:44.233 --> 00:07:47.294]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:07:47.294 --> 00:07:49.055]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:07:49.055 --> 00:07:49.975]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:04.303]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.303 --> 00:08:07.088]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:18.081]  This is the Alex Jones Show with me, your sitting host, Paul Joseph Watson, while Alex is away working on a project.
[00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:35.404]  Now, as we were discussing before the break, while Chris Matthews and MSNBC are preparing to smear grassroots Americans as violent radicals with this upcoming hit piece, The Rise of the New Right, which airs on MSNBC this Wednesday at 7 p.m.
[00:08:35.404 --> 00:08:38.585]  Eastern Time, we have Democratic Congressman
[00:08:39.105 --> 00:08:49.248]  Actually physically assaulting reporters who are merely walking down the street asking this congressman if he supports the Obama agenda.
[00:08:49.248 --> 00:09:07.314]  Now this mirrors what we reported on last week which was this anti-bailout protest in North Carolina where you had this Obamanoid goon descend on the protest and start an argument with the protesters about who was to blame for the financial crisis.
[00:09:07.854 --> 00:09:20.308]  And of course, as those of you who have seen the video will know, and YouTube actually scrubbed, deleted, memory-holed the video shortly after we posted that article last week.
[00:09:20.308 --> 00:09:22.150]  It has since re-emerged.
[00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:25.153]  But it shows this Obamanoid activist
[00:09:26.294 --> 00:09:32.855]  landing a left hook on this anti-bailout protester who's protesting against big government.
[00:09:32.855 --> 00:09:49.879]  So again, and we've documented many other examples which were in the article, while the media is smearing so-called right-wingers, which in reality are just grassroots libertarians, independents, conservatives across the board, as dangerous radicals who are a physical threat
[00:09:50.359 --> 00:09:50.419]  and
[00:10:07.366 --> 00:10:10.087]  We've got this hit piece coming up on Wednesday.
[00:10:10.087 --> 00:10:15.708]  We got the leaked script last week from a concerned MSNBC staffer.
[00:10:15.708 --> 00:10:36.513]  Now, just to understand this, Alex Jones went into this interview, he initially thought he would be interviewed by Chris Matthews, but they sent the production team from MSNBC to interview Alex, and they gave him their word that this would be a balanced and fair biography of the growth of the anti-big government movement.
[00:10:37.193 --> 00:10:54.641]  And yet, we received the transcript, we went through it, and it became clear that MSNBC, once again, had resorted to exercising the same tired old cliches about how anyone who criticizes the federal government is basically a dangerous, radical, neo-Nazi racist.
[00:10:54.641 --> 00:11:00.004]  They compare them to these obscure radio hosts in the 30s who supported Hitler.
[00:11:01.444 --> 00:11:05.825]  So they're smearing us as racist radicals who probably want to kill people.
[00:11:05.825 --> 00:11:18.888]  You had the quote from the Southern Poverty Law Center individual Mark Potak who said that, not Alex Jones, let's be fair, but Alex Jones' listeners want to go on killing sprees.
[00:11:18.888 --> 00:11:27.730]  Now, I've been working for Alex for about eight years and I've never talked to, received an email or met an Alex Jones listener who wants to go on a killing spree.
[00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:32.053]  Now, you had the Poplarski thing, which was a complete smear.
[00:11:32.053 --> 00:11:35.976]  The Pittsburgh cop killer, he actually hated Alex Jones.
[00:11:35.976 --> 00:11:43.223]  He left messages on our website, which we found, where he stated that he opposed Alex Jones' peaceful message.
[00:11:43.223 --> 00:11:51.890]  Several publications had to retract that, but it's still repeated ad infinitum, even though it's been debunked over and over again.
[00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:53.652]  So, we're going to get the same kind of rhetoric
[00:11:55.461 --> 00:12:17.501]  With this rise of the new right hit piece that's coming up on Wednesday, which is unsurprising given the fact that Matthews and certainly MSNBC as a whole have made a habit out of portraying Tea Party members, Second Amendment activists and basically anyone who stands up against big government as part of a new frontier of violent extremism.
[00:12:18.632 --> 00:12:34.379]  But for me, and I've been researching this for an article which is going to go up on prisonplanet.com later today, Matthews' agenda-driven bias is exposed fundamentally with no better a comparison than how he
[00:12:35.620 --> 00:13:01.113]  Matthews, Chris Matthews, during an interview with Bill Ayers, the domestic terrorist, the leader of the Weather Underground who bombed government buildings in the 70s, basically acted as an apologist for Ayers' terrorist past and indeed found common ground with Ayers in other areas of US government policy, both domestic and geopolitical.
[00:13:01.113 --> 00:13:02.414]  Now this is important because
[00:13:03.957 --> 00:13:18.540]  According to former FBI agent Larry Grathwall, who was assigned to infiltrate the Weather Underground as a double agent, he actually infiltrated their central committee where Bill Ayers was giving out the orders.
[00:13:19.301 --> 00:13:41.226]  He discovered that the Weather Underground were bombing the Pentagon, the State Department and the Capitol Hill building as part of an attempt to cause the collapse of the United States government and open the door for Chinese and Soviet troops and Cuban troops to occupy the country and set up a communist dictatorship.
[00:13:41.966 --> 00:14:03.383]  Now this is admitted by Grathwald in his testimony, and he states in this clip that we'll play in a second, that Bill Ayres, who was the leader of the Weather Underground, stated that Americans who would try to resist this communist takeover would be taken to quote, re-education centres in the South West.
[00:14:04.244 --> 00:14:12.030]  And asked what he would do with those Americans who still refuse to convert to this communist revolution.
[00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:18.154]  According to Grathwal, the FBI agent, Bill Ayers said that they would be eliminated.
[00:14:18.154 --> 00:14:27.541]  And he went on to say that 25 million Americans who they would take to these concentration camps, these re-education centers, would be killed.
[00:14:28.777 --> 00:14:37.403]  And this is a guy that Chris Matthews has defended publicly during an interview and in the aftermath of that interview, as we shall see.
[00:14:37.403 --> 00:14:45.308]  And it's a guy who also launched the political career of Barack Obama in his living room.
[00:14:45.308 --> 00:14:53.973]  This is Bill Ayers, the domestic terrorist who bombed the Pentagon, who bombed the State Department and the Capitol building in Washington.
[00:14:55.114 --> 00:15:09.856]  Now, in this clip, Grathwald, the FBI agent, also points out that most of the people advocating this brutality, this slaughter of 25 million Americans, had graduate degrees from Columbia or well-known education centers.
[00:15:11.077 --> 00:15:29.702]  And this ties into the fact that after his terrorist past Ayers went on to become an influential key figure in the development of Barack Obama's political career and also a key figure in the American educational establishment as he is now a professor at Illinois University.
[00:15:29.702 --> 00:15:36.984]  So let's play this FBI agent, Grathwal, describing what the goals were of Bill Ayers in the weather underground.
[00:15:36.984 --> 00:15:37.744]  Let's play the clip.
[00:15:39.424 --> 00:15:44.549]  I brought up the subject of what's going to happen after we take over the government.
[00:15:44.549 --> 00:15:52.837]  We become responsible then for administrating 250 million people.
[00:15:52.837 --> 00:15:55.140]  And there was no answers.
[00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.162]  No one had given any thought to economics.
[00:15:58.377 --> 00:16:01.459]  How are you going to clothe and feed these people?
[00:16:01.459 --> 00:16:13.027]  The only thing that I could get was that they expected that the Cubans and the North Vietnamese and the Chinese and the Russians would all want to occupy different portions of the United States.
[00:16:13.027 --> 00:16:18.511]  They also believed that their immediate responsibility would be to protect against what they called the counter-revolution.
[00:16:20.118 --> 00:16:32.528]  And they felt that this counter-revolution could best be guarded against by creating and establishing re-education centers in the Southwest.
[00:16:32.528 --> 00:16:38.814]  Where we would take all the people who needed to be re-educated into the new way of thinking and teach them.
[00:16:40.313 --> 00:16:42.555]  How things were going to be.
[00:16:42.555 --> 00:16:46.179]  I asked, well, what is going to happen to those people that we can't re-educate?
[00:16:46.179 --> 00:16:50.003]  That are die-hard capitalists.
[00:16:50.003 --> 00:16:54.067]  And the reply was that they'd have to be eliminated.
[00:16:54.067 --> 00:17:02.495]  And when I pursued this further, they estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these re-education centers.
[00:17:02.495 --> 00:17:04.197]  And when I say eliminate, I mean kill.
[00:17:05.794 --> 00:17:07.355]  25 million people.
[00:17:07.355 --> 00:17:29.055]  I want you to imagine sitting in a room with 25 people, most of which have graduate degrees from Columbia and other well-known educational centers, and hear them figuring out the logistics for the elimination of 25 million people.
[00:17:29.055 --> 00:17:30.756]  And they were dead serious.
[00:17:32.571 --> 00:18:01.594]  So that's Larry Grathwald, former FBI agent, who was tasked to infiltrate Bill Air's Weather Underground organization, saying that if the Communist Revolution was to be successful, that they would allow Soviet and Russian troops to steam in, and any Americans who tried to resist this new tyranny would be taken to, quote, re-education centers, and if they further resisted to convert to the Communist Revolution, they would be, quote, eliminated.
[00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:16.821]  Now, this is coming from a guy, Bill Ayres, who bombed the Pentagon and the State Department and Capitol Hill building, who Chris Matthews threw softball questions at and found common ground with.
[00:18:16.821 --> 00:18:26.986]  He's a domestic terrorist, and yet Matthews, in this new hit piece coming up on Wednesday, says that it's the grassroots American people who are the real violent threat.
[00:18:27.546 --> 00:18:40.433]  Now, the most disturbing aspect of what you just heard from Grathwal was not the likelihood that the Weather Underground could have achieved this communist revolution, which was obviously never going to be successful.
[00:18:40.433 --> 00:18:48.177]  It's the fact that the man who expressed these intentions to eliminate 25 million Americans who would resist this takeover,
[00:18:49.538 --> 00:19:05.146]  Went on to become an influential elitist within American educational circles and also came to the aid and directly influenced and launched indeed Barack Obama's political career from his own living room.
[00:19:06.075 --> 00:19:19.681]  Now, while Matthew Savage's anti-big government activist is representing this dangerous threat, he portrays Ayers as, you know, this reasonable, progressive and reformed individual.
[00:19:19.681 --> 00:19:26.164]  You can go on YouTube and search for Bill Ayers, Chris Matthews, and we're not going to play it because it's a 20 minute interview.
[00:19:26.724 --> 00:19:41.928]  But compare that interview of Ayers with the interview, for example, that Chris Matthews conducted with Oathkeeper and Tea Party activist Sheriff Richard Mack, who has never bombed anything and has vehemently shunned violence of any kind.
[00:19:41.928 --> 00:19:50.691]  So contrast Matthews' kid-glove treatment of Ayers, the domestic terrorist, with Richard Mack, who is one of the people he's trying to smear as this dangerous radical.
[00:19:51.311 --> 00:19:55.817]  The hypocrisy knows no bounds and we'll continue with this after the break.
[00:19:55.817 --> 00:19:57.318]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:00.931 --> 00:20:01.511]  Fact.
[00:20:01.511 --> 00:20:02.871]  Four million people in the U.S.
[00:20:02.871 --> 00:20:04.992]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[00:20:04.992 --> 00:20:05.512]  Fact.
[00:20:05.512 --> 00:20:09.193]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the eighth leading cause of death among Americans.
[00:20:09.193 --> 00:20:09.813]  Fact.
[00:20:09.813 --> 00:20:15.334]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[00:20:15.334 --> 00:20:15.954]  Fact.
[00:20:15.954 --> 00:20:20.155]  One in ten Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[00:20:20.155 --> 00:20:20.735]  Fact.
[00:20:20.735 --> 00:20:24.436]  Anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.
[00:20:24.736 --> 00:20:25.217]  I think so.

[00:22:21.576 --> 00:22:22.356]  Surrender.
[00:22:22.356 --> 00:22:26.160]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.301]  What then?

[00:23:00.285 --> 00:23:01.245]  Here's a question.
[00:23:01.245 --> 00:23:07.448]  If you have a septic system, did you know that proper maintenance can save you thousands of dollars in costly and unnecessary repairs?
[00:23:07.448 --> 00:23:08.828]  The answer is simple.

[00:23:42.478 --> 00:23:42.798]  I think so.
[00:24:10.621 --> 00:24:15.504]  It's the Alex Jones Show on this Monday, June the 14th.
[00:24:15.504 --> 00:24:18.245]  I'm sitting in for Alex, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:24:18.245 --> 00:24:21.206]  We'll be taking your calls after the bottom of the hour.
[00:24:21.206 --> 00:24:21.867]  The number is 888-201-2244.
[00:24:21.867 --> 00:24:22.167]  That's 888-201-2244.
[00:24:22.167 --> 00:24:23.828]  So get lined up on the boards and
[00:24:32.692 --> 00:24:48.704]  We'll discuss what we've been covering before the break, which is the fact that MSNBC are readying this huge hit piece, The Rise of the New Right, against grassroots American political activists while Chris Matthews himself and MSNBC are
[00:24:49.284 --> 00:25:17.208]  Throwing softball questions to and finding common ground with real domestic terrorists like the former Weather Underground leader Bill Ayers who, as we played from the FBI agent before the break, planned to allow the invasion of America by these Soviet and Chinese troops and the setup of vast gulags whereby Americans who disagreed with this would be quote re-educated or if not killed.
[00:25:17.788 --> 00:25:30.897]  Now this is the ultimate example of a domestic terrorist and extremist and yet he's being given cover and Chris Matthews is running defense for him while smearing us as the real violent radicals.
[00:25:30.897 --> 00:25:36.461]  It's the height of hypocrisy and it just exposes their agenda-driven bias for what it is.
[00:25:38.926 --> 00:25:57.024]  After Chris Matthews interviewed Bill Ayers, which took place in October 2008, after this controversy of Ayers' links with Obama had surfaced, he again ran defence for the domestic terrorist Bill Ayers during an interview with Pat Buchanan.
[00:25:57.745 --> 00:26:09.797]  Um, when Buchanan raised Ayers' comments to the New York Times in September 2001 when Ayers said, quote, I don't regret setting bombs and I feel we didn't do enough.
[00:26:09.797 --> 00:26:17.205]  And then if he was asked if he'd do it all again and Ayers responded, quote, I don't want to discount the possibility.
[00:26:17.685 --> 00:26:32.134]  So this is a man who not only planned and executed bombings against government buildings in the 70s, but decades later he expresses no remorse whatsoever and even indicates that he would be willing to do it again.
[00:26:32.134 --> 00:26:40.859]  And this is a man who has been defended and who has found common ground with Chris Matthews during his interview with Matthews on MSNBC.
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:56.375]  Now, I mean, it comes as no surprise that Matthews is cosying up to this communist revolutionary airs, because Matthews himself once named one of his heroes as the communist ideologue Saul Alinsky.
[00:26:57.711 --> 00:27:10.775]  And also recall that during a segment with Rachel Maddow on MSNBC, Matthews also let slip the fact that he analyses politics from a Marxist perspective.
[00:27:10.775 --> 00:27:13.076]  And we've got that clip, so we go to that clip now.
[00:27:14.275 --> 00:27:17.116]  No, people, I'm Marxist when it comes to analysis.
[00:27:17.116 --> 00:27:22.979]  People judge their current economic circumstances and then they make political judgments.
[00:27:22.979 --> 00:27:28.702]  This is one of those nights, though, when we can be absolute purists in terms of extrapolating from this one race.
[00:27:30.256 --> 00:27:36.240]  So there you have Chris Matthews saying, quote, I'm Marxist when it comes to analysis.
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:40.923]  So he's admitting to analysing politics from a Marxist perspective.
[00:27:40.923 --> 00:27:43.405]  Now, what do we do here at the Alex Jones Show?
[00:27:43.405 --> 00:27:48.869]  We analyse politics from a constitutionalist stroke libertarian perspective.
[00:27:48.869 --> 00:27:49.369]  Why?
[00:27:49.369 --> 00:27:52.151]  Because we're constitutionalist stroke libertarians.
[00:27:53.223 --> 00:27:59.346]  Now, if Matthews has admitted he analyses politics from a Marxist perspective, then what does that make him?
[00:27:59.346 --> 00:28:01.627]  It makes him a Marxist.
[00:28:01.627 --> 00:28:13.772]  And this was only emphasised by another segment on his MSNBC show, which he had several months ago, whereby he had these guests on from Politico and these other organisations.
[00:28:13.772 --> 00:28:21.336]  And Matthews and his guests basically implied that anyone who is sceptical of or expresses disdain or distrust towards government
[00:28:21.996 --> 00:28:24.878]  Is psychologically insane.
[00:28:24.878 --> 00:28:26.159]  Now where does this come from?
[00:28:26.159 --> 00:28:40.628]  It comes from the Soviet mental asylums which were used by the Soviets, by the Communists, to isolate political prisoners by categorizing their distrust of the state as a psychological illness.
[00:28:41.847 --> 00:28:54.557]  And it's similar to what happens today in North Korea with Kim Jong-il, where 200 million people are held in gulags because they've expressed distrust of the government, even to just a mild extent.
[00:28:54.557 --> 00:29:01.642]  So this is what Matthews was advocating during this debate, where he said that people who distrust government are psychologically insane.
[00:29:01.642 --> 00:29:10.089]  Is it any wonder that this is a guy who's defended somebody who once called for giant communist re-education camps in America?
[00:29:11.587 --> 00:29:27.690]  And as I said before, the notion that Ayers is merely this reasonable, rational individual is completely contradicted by the fact that he still advocates these kind of methods and he's unrepentant for his bombings against government buildings.
[00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:33.591]  Now we'll continue to explore Ayers' ties to Obama himself after the break.
[00:29:33.591 --> 00:29:35.791]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:35.791 --> 00:29:37.151]  Load up the board with your calls.
[00:29:37.151 --> 00:29:39.272]  We'll be getting to you after the bottom of the hour.
[00:29:39.272 --> 00:29:39.912]  Stay tuned.
[00:29:50.629 --> 00:29:52.032]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.032 --> 00:29:53.615]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.615 --> 00:29:57.342]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.806 --> 00:30:05.767]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.

[00:30:59.738 --> 00:31:04.282]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:04.282 --> 00:31:05.202]  Number 1.
[00:31:05.202 --> 00:31:08.625]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:08.625 --> 00:31:09.486]  Number 2.
[00:31:09.486 --> 00:31:14.369]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:14.369 --> 00:31:15.130]  It's true.
[00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:19.994]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:19.994 --> 00:31:20.814]  Number 3.
[00:31:20.814 --> 00:31:24.397]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:24.397 --> 00:31:28.100]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:29.100]  Number 4.
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:31.861]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:31.861 --> 00:31:35.543]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:35.543 --> 00:31:36.323]  Number 5.
[00:31:36.323 --> 00:31:40.485]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:40.485 --> 00:31:45.527]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:45.527 --> 00:31:49.708]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:31:56.511 --> 00:32:03.695]  You may be arrested and you're subject to other police action.
[00:32:03.695 --> 00:32:04.956]  Tyranny is here.
[00:32:04.956 --> 00:32:08.818]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:32:08.818 --> 00:32:11.140]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:17.003]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:32:17.003 --> 00:32:23.227]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:32:23.647 --> 00:32:29.630]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:33.792]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:32:33.792 --> 00:32:38.095]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:32:38.095 --> 00:32:44.038]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:32:44.038 --> 00:32:47.600]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.581]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:32:49.581 --> 00:32:50.021]  It's here.

[00:33:16.638 --> 00:33:18.720]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:22.322]  I'm your host, Paul Joseph Watson, sitting in for Alex.
[00:33:22.322 --> 00:33:38.474]  Now, we're talking about Bill Ayres, the domestic terrorist Weather Underground founder, who was defended by Chris Matthews, who is preparing to smear grassroots Americans as violent radicals and domestic terrorists with this new hit piece coming up on Wednesday.
[00:33:38.474 --> 00:33:38.635]  Now,
[00:33:39.435 --> 00:33:51.383]  I went into this whole Bill Ayers-Obama thing thinking that it was just a political talking point that was exaggerated by the McCain-Palin campaign in 2008.
[00:33:51.383 --> 00:34:06.014]  I didn't even pay much heed to it at the time, but I was up until about 2am last night researching it, and it turns out that it indeed is true that Barack Obama's political career was launched
[00:34:06.614 --> 00:34:36.134]  In the living room of Bill Ayers, this domestic terrorist communist revolutionary, and this in fact was admitted to, it was not only reported in the Politico, it was admitted to by Maria Warren, who was a liberal political activist who attended this infamous Ayers-Obama function, who stated quite plainly, quote, when I first met Barack Obama, he was giving a talk in the living room of those two legends in their own minds, Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dawn.
[00:34:36.574 --> 00:34:43.699]  They were launching him, introducing him to the Hyde Park community as the best thing since sliced bread.
[00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:55.888]  So this is the guy who bombed government buildings, the communist revolutionary Bill Ayers, who helped launch Barack Obama's political career back in 1995.
[00:34:55.888 --> 00:35:01.552]  And it's not just the fact that they sat on the same board of this educational organization.
[00:35:01.552 --> 00:35:05.174]  The depth of Ayers' relationship with Obama is revealed by
[00:35:06.175 --> 00:35:19.640]  The startling revelations that were uncovered by the journalist, the writer Jack Cashill, of Obama's book, Obama's 1995 memoir, Dreams From My Father.
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:30.605]  Now, Cashill has written over a dozen articles which prove, and this was later backed up and verified by another author called Christopher Anderson, that the terrorist Bill Ayres
[00:35:31.305 --> 00:35:43.273]  The communist revolutionary who wanted to kill 25 million Americans, according to FBI agent Larry Grathwell, significantly contributed and even wrote significant parts of Obama's 1995 book.
[00:35:45.919 --> 00:35:59.123]  Now, in reality, the implications of Obama's ties with Ayers, bearing in mind his history, which Chris Matthews has defended, soft-peddled, ignored, are frightening.
[00:35:59.123 --> 00:36:04.005]  And they go beyond what I'm talking about today, which is MSNBC's hypocrisy.
[00:36:04.005 --> 00:36:12.788]  But to research the connection between Ayers and Obama, and what Ayers advocated, really strikes at the root of the trouble we're in.
[00:36:13.468 --> 00:36:27.932]  And in particular how Barack Obama, Barry Citero, is a completely hollow sock puppet whose strings are being pulled by the most violent extremists in the elite that are inside America.
[00:36:27.932 --> 00:36:32.514]  Remember that Bill Ayers is now a prominent educational establishment member.
[00:36:32.514 --> 00:36:36.555]  He's got a professorship with the University of Illinois.
[00:36:37.435 --> 00:37:00.175]  So, in summary, while Matthews is preparing to smear peaceful American activists as domestic terrorists, he's actually running defense for a real domestic terrorist who masterminded bombings in America and somebody who went on to become an influential figure in steering Barack Obama's path to the White House.
[00:37:00.675 --> 00:37:22.706]  That's a fundamentally frightening story, but it also shows how much hypocrisy Matthews is engaging in when he says that people like Alex Jones are the violent radicals, when he's running defence and agreeing and finding common ground with real violent radicals who carried out bombings like Weather Underground founder Bill Ayres.
[00:37:23.286 --> 00:37:26.008]  So I want to hear what you've got to say about this.
[00:37:26.008 --> 00:37:33.293]  We'll also cover the other news, if you wish, about BP, the oil spill, the developments there, and whatever else is on your mind.
[00:37:33.293 --> 00:37:37.036]  So we're going to go to our first caller now, which is Mark in Florida.
[00:37:37.036 --> 00:37:38.097]  Mark, you are on the air.
[00:37:38.097 --> 00:37:40.598]  What's on your mind today?
[00:37:40.598 --> 00:37:52.347]  Yeah, I was just wondering, where do you see all this heading as far as with the documentary, whatever you want to call it, that's about to be released on Alex Jones and all this
[00:37:53.499 --> 00:37:56.821]  What they're trying to build up against, you know, right-wingers and things like that.
[00:37:56.821 --> 00:37:57.702]  Where do you think that's headed?
[00:37:57.702 --> 00:38:00.344]  If that makes any sense.
[00:38:00.344 --> 00:38:16.156]  Yeah, I think it's clearly heading towards an attempt to shut down free speech, not only in terms of internet censorship, which we already see in developed nations like Australia, where they are now filtering websites which are deemed, quote, offensive.
[00:38:16.596 --> 00:38:21.219]  Now this is not China, this is not North Korea or anywhere like that.
[00:38:21.219 --> 00:38:27.222]  It's in Australia and there are efforts to push that through both in the UK, which is already happening, and in America.
[00:38:27.222 --> 00:38:29.943]  So they're going to try and block out our websites.
[00:38:29.943 --> 00:38:43.330]  You've heard the Federal Communications Commission going after talk radio and also independent websites like Drudge Report with this so-called Drudge Tax, which is also a way of trying to financially
[00:38:44.731 --> 00:39:14.280]  eradicate independent bloggers and independent political news websites and now if they demonize our free speech as violent radicalism and certainly if they if events transpire which are carried out by people supposedly forwarding this violent extremism which we've warned against then that will be the pretext for increased censorship of not only the Tea Party but basically anyone who opposes big government
[00:39:18.666 --> 00:39:27.357]  In an off subject kind of question, I've seen on the news, did you see that they're trying to push Predator drones in US airspace?
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:48.013]  Yeah, I saw that, and it clearly states that they're going to push to use them for law enforcement in America, and this is not just going to be on the border, where people want to see them introduced for obvious reasons, but this is going to be predator drones flying around inside the United States.
[00:39:48.993 --> 00:39:54.418]  Not only spying on people, but eventually they're talking about them being armed as well.
[00:39:54.418 --> 00:40:12.672]  So this is a massive advancement of the police state, and it's basically saying that America is now no different from Iraq or Afghanistan, where the so-called, quote, insurgents are going to be targeted by these predator drones, which are going to be armed with weapons, as well as spy capabilities.
[00:40:12.672 --> 00:40:16.155]  So yeah, that was in the Associated Press this morning, that they're now
[00:40:16.835 --> 00:40:28.583]  Getting ready to introduce predator drones inside the United States for law enforcement, which shows yet another advancement of this police state that's strangling us.
[00:40:28.583 --> 00:40:29.684]  Thanks for the call, Mark.
[00:40:29.684 --> 00:40:32.345]  We're gonna go to Colby in New Hampshire.
[00:40:32.345 --> 00:40:33.186]  Colby, you're on the air.
[00:40:47.020 --> 00:41:08.981]  Apparently they're integrating a real ID security system into the game and I thought this was an interesting development because as of 2008 there was 11.5 million people playing that game and you know that's kind of a frightening personal security breach in my opinion going in that direction.
[00:41:10.967 --> 00:41:31.553]  Yeah, it's being reported by the website riptengot.com, World of Warcraft Real ID Incoming, and the article says, if you're one of the 11.5 million World of Warcraft players, you should be excited to learn that Blizzard is implementing a new friends list management system dubbed Real ID, which claims to
[00:41:32.473 --> 00:41:35.896]  Increase the level of interaction players have with each other.
[00:41:35.896 --> 00:41:42.782]  Now, do you know anything about exactly what users will be required to do as part of this real ID system?
[00:41:42.782 --> 00:41:48.286]  Is it a kind of individual identification system?
[00:41:48.286 --> 00:41:49.567]  It certainly seems like that.
[00:41:49.567 --> 00:41:57.333]  I haven't seen specific biometrics or anything like that, but it seems like it's a further way to kind of tie in the Internet 2.0.
[00:41:59.053 --> 00:42:04.679]  theory of identifying everyone individually and ensuring that whatever they've done is tracked to their personal ID
[00:42:08.189 --> 00:42:08.909]  Right, yeah.
[00:42:08.909 --> 00:42:21.516]  It's kind of like how the Chinese wanted to individually identify bloggers by each giving them an ID number which they would be required to obtain before they could write anything on the internet.
[00:42:21.516 --> 00:42:35.644]  And it's part of this increasing move towards identification of individuals, taking away the anonymous aspect of the internet which many people exercise as a tool for their free speech.
[00:42:35.644 --> 00:42:36.684]  So, yeah.
[00:42:37.765 --> 00:42:42.067]  We'll definitely keep track of this, and we'll be posting it on the website later today.
[00:42:42.067 --> 00:42:44.388]  That's a very interesting story.
[00:42:44.388 --> 00:42:47.749]  We go to our next caller now, and it's Ronnie in Texas.
[00:42:47.749 --> 00:42:50.410]  Ronnie, what's on your mind today?
[00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:51.070]  Thank you, sir.
[00:42:51.070 --> 00:43:06.296]  I just wanted to share with you that in Chicago, while attending a pre-Ralph Nader Green party gathering, when I was back then at Open Steve Forbes Tax Reform Enthusiast, I was informed that the Greens were actually the front.
[00:43:07.128 --> 00:43:14.791]  For the communists and the labor unions who were running this leftist leaning third party movement, they were hijacking the Greens.
[00:43:14.791 --> 00:43:18.913]  You know, the environmental movement was just completely hijacked by these communists.
[00:43:18.913 --> 00:43:29.258]  And then, while trying to break through back here in Texas into the Libertarian Party, I discovered the same criminal control of the Texas Libertarian Party, refusing to talk.
[00:43:29.258 --> 00:43:35.821]  This is the Libertarian Party, and they refuse to talk about the war on pot smokers, medicinal marijuana, supporting our troops,
[00:43:36.471 --> 00:43:41.496]  With freedom for farmers, you know, the medicinal marijuana really helps traumatic brain injury people.
[00:43:41.496 --> 00:43:44.259]  And I can personally give you a testimonial on that.
[00:43:44.259 --> 00:43:50.585]  And that's some of this information I was trying to share and run as a candidate and everything and influence their leaning.
[00:43:50.585 --> 00:43:51.987]  But it's completely controlled.
[00:43:51.987 --> 00:43:55.110]  The third party movement here in Texas is just completely controlled.
[00:43:55.632 --> 00:44:00.455]  By either the out-and-out communists in the Greens or the so-called libertarians.
[00:44:00.455 --> 00:44:07.220]  And the guy who ran the show here now in Travis County is now the national leader of the Libertarian Party.
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:08.341]  So they're just completely...
[00:44:09.159 --> 00:44:15.262]  Stained with criminality and refusal to face real problems and real solutions.
[00:44:15.262 --> 00:44:19.944]  That is, you know, freedom for farmers is a great solution to a whole lot of problems.
[00:44:19.944 --> 00:44:25.307]  Family farms, you know, conserving topsoil to help feed our future, getting out of wars, these idiotic wars.
[00:44:25.307 --> 00:44:31.430]  If we just come to grips with freedom for farmers, you know, around the world, we'd make a whole lot of progress.
[00:44:32.847 --> 00:44:51.842]  Yeah, well, the point you raise about the Greens actually now being quite blasé, the communists, that was actually admitted by the Greenpeace founder, Patrick Moore, who resigned from Greenpeace partly in protest that the people who had now taken over the organisation
[00:44:52.242 --> 00:44:52.362]  We're
[00:45:09.324 --> 00:45:15.927]  Eviscerating the middle class, imposing this post-industrial revolution, and turning us back into serfs.
[00:45:15.927 --> 00:45:20.529]  So, definitely, I mean, the modern environmentalist movement is nothing more than a watermelon.
[00:45:20.529 --> 00:45:38.696]  It's green on the outside, it's red on the inside, and these kind of control freaks will dress themselves in any political ideology that suits them at their present time to further their brutal and tyrannical agenda, and that's what we've seen with the Greens advancing this current green fascism.
[00:45:39.576 --> 00:45:39.756]  Yes, I've...
[00:45:48.303 --> 00:45:55.626]  Supported Alex Jones, though I'm on the left, against any claims that he was for violence and the rest of it.
[00:45:55.626 --> 00:46:10.051]  But I find, at this point, that what I see as a fascist element from the John Birch Society, this kind of red-baiting, because I'm very familiar, back in the 60s, with the Bill Ayers faction of SDS.
[00:46:10.051 --> 00:46:12.092]  It was rabidly anti-communist.
[00:46:12.552 --> 00:46:26.742]  The Communist faction within SDS, Progressive Labor Party, had the position that Ayers and these others were totally agent provocateurs, that they were trying to discredit the anti-war movement.
[00:46:26.742 --> 00:46:31.985]  The Progressive Labor Party was the Communist faction within SDS.
[00:46:31.985 --> 00:46:41.572]  It agreed with you that this deindustrialization was really up front for these fake liberals within the movement.
[00:46:42.812 --> 00:46:57.362]  I found out that the John Birch Society, which is very influential with Alex Jones, specialized in these kinds of outrageous fabrications of so-called FBI agents that would scare among about
[00:46:57.762 --> 00:47:17.359]  The Russians and the Chinese and the Cubans invading the United States, just fantastical nightmare type of fabrications that were actually run by Western Gold, which was connected with the John Birch Society and collaborated with police squads to frame up people around the country.
[00:47:18.059 --> 00:47:29.903]  Even J. Edgar Hoover, who was a specialist in this kind of smear job with his COINTELPRO, said these guys were absolutely discrediting his ability to discredit people because they were so far off the edge of the world.
[00:47:29.903 --> 00:47:38.186]  For you to quote this so-called FBI agent saying that Russia and China and Cuba were going to invade the country, even though there was a Russia-China split,
[00:47:39.847 --> 00:47:58.422]  I think that really destroys your credibility and places you in the totally discredited corner of the John Birch Society, which I find too often influences Alex Jones, who I've supported, even though I disagree with his positions on a limit.
[00:47:59.944 --> 00:48:04.167]  Okay, thanks for the call, yeah, I'll respond.
[00:48:04.167 --> 00:48:16.879]  Basically what Grethelwald was saying in that clip was that he asked Bill Ayres and the Weather Underground what would replace the collapse of the American government if a vacuum was to exist.
[00:48:17.579 --> 00:48:29.833]  He basically said that the Weather Underground didn't have any plan for the economic, the societal, the governmental restoration of a new government under their ideology.
[00:48:29.833 --> 00:48:35.278]  So that's why they said that they'd just let the Soviets or the Cubans or the Chinese come in.
[00:48:35.899 --> 00:48:55.889]  Now I agree with your point that Ayers himself was never this big anti-establishment figure which is why in fact he was hired and he became part of the political elite when he became an Illinois professor and this big educational establishment figure in America.
[00:48:55.889 --> 00:49:00.112]  So the elite certainly used Ayers for their own ends and to create this
[00:49:01.072 --> 00:49:01.332]  I don't
[00:49:18.959 --> 00:49:26.042]  Plausibly would have been able to cause the collapse of America which would lead to this communist invasion.
[00:49:26.042 --> 00:49:37.848]  I'm saying that that was their ideology and the fact that Chris Matthews defends it while attacking grassroots Americans as political extremists is the height of hypocrisy.
[00:49:38.328 --> 00:49:49.853]  So it's not a question of whether Bill Ayres or the communist left-wingers at the time really intended to or had a chance of bringing in this communist revolution.
[00:49:49.853 --> 00:50:03.199]  It's the fact that Chris Matthews now gives them softball questions and basically doesn't even grill them on the fact that they supposedly wanted to bring Americans into re-education centres and kill them all.
[00:50:03.719 --> 00:50:12.085]  So, I mean, he cannot demonize American citizens as violent radicals while giving aid and comfort to people like Bill Ayers.
[00:50:12.085 --> 00:50:16.509]  And it's a fact that Bill Ayers was influential in starting Barack Obama's political career.
[00:50:16.509 --> 00:50:18.130]  That's on the record.
[00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:19.130]  Thanks for the call.
[00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:21.052]  Now we're going to Larry in Louisiana.
[00:50:21.052 --> 00:50:23.193]  Larry, you are on the air.
[00:50:23.193 --> 00:50:23.674]  Hi, Paul.
[00:50:23.674 --> 00:50:25.135]  Can you hear me?
[00:50:25.135 --> 00:50:25.335]  Yeah.
[00:50:26.307 --> 00:50:27.207]  Okay, good.
[00:50:27.207 --> 00:50:35.729]  They had a war in a place they call the colonies here against what they said was the crown.
[00:50:35.729 --> 00:50:41.471]  Now they teach the children, they call the American children, that they won this revolutionary war.
[00:50:41.471 --> 00:50:47.012]  What do they teach the children in England, Britain, about who won that war?
[00:50:49.215 --> 00:50:51.176]  I'll answer that after the break, Larry.
[00:50:51.176 --> 00:50:55.038]  We're coming up now on a break, and we'll be back in a couple of minutes.
[00:50:55.038 --> 00:50:56.459]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:56.459 --> 00:51:00.741]  We're gonna squeeze in more of your calls after the break, so stay tuned.
[00:51:00.741 --> 00:51:05.304]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[00:51:05.304 --> 00:51:05.884]  Number one.
[00:51:06.204 --> 00:51:10.487]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:51:10.487 --> 00:51:15.390]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:16.131]  It's true.
[00:51:16.131 --> 00:51:21.835]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:51:21.835 --> 00:51:25.417]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:51:25.417 --> 00:51:30.120]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:32.462]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:51:32.882 --> 00:51:38.944]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:51:38.944 --> 00:51:46.545]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:51:46.545 --> 00:51:50.727]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:51:50.727 --> 00:51:52.507]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:51:52.507 --> 00:51:57.108]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:52:00.888 --> 00:52:05.851]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:52:05.851 --> 00:52:06.852]  What have we got?
[00:52:06.852 --> 00:52:09.293]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:52:09.293 --> 00:52:10.294]  A republic.
[00:52:10.294 --> 00:52:12.935]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:52:12.935 --> 00:52:15.217]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:52:15.217 --> 00:52:17.238]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:52:17.238 --> 00:52:18.919]  So they think they own our land?
[00:52:18.919 --> 00:52:20.240]  They think they own our water?
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:20.840]  Children?
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:21.961]  Our education?
[00:52:21.961 --> 00:52:22.782]  Our money?
[00:52:22.782 --> 00:52:26.444]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:52:26.804 --> 00:52:30.490]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:52:30.490 --> 00:52:31.792]  You are being warned.
[00:52:31.792 --> 00:52:32.814]  We have the facts.
[00:52:32.814 --> 00:52:33.975]  We have the Constitution.
[00:52:33.975 --> 00:52:34.877]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:52:34.877 --> 00:52:35.758]  We have common law.
[00:52:35.758 --> 00:52:38.302]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:38.302 --> 00:52:42.068]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:52:42.168 --> 00:52:47.113]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:52:47.113 --> 00:52:48.614]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:52:48.614 --> 00:52:49.715]  Don't tread on me.
[00:52:49.715 --> 00:52:56.142]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:53:01.414 --> 00:53:06.038]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:54:06.015 --> 00:54:09.216]  This is the final segment of the first hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:09.216 --> 00:54:12.077]  This is Paul Joseph Watson sitting in for Alex.
[00:54:12.077 --> 00:54:19.059]  Uh, we had a caller before the break asking how the American Revolution was taught to, uh, British children in British schools.
[00:54:19.059 --> 00:54:24.060]  From my experience, the American Revolution is not taught, um, up until high school.
[00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:31.342]  Certainly the courses I took at, um, university, you know, college level, there was no option to study the American Revolution.
[00:54:31.342 --> 00:54:33.683]  Basically, it's completely ignored.
[00:54:33.683 --> 00:54:34.963]  Um, the reason I left
[00:54:35.243 --> 00:54:46.874]  University eventually was because they were teaching the fact that Lenin and Stalin were basically brilliant and that everything they did was saintly, so that was a good reason to leave.
[00:54:46.874 --> 00:54:57.223]  What concerns me, as is seen in Alex's video The Road to Tyranny, is the fact that FEMA now teaches law enforcement personnel that the founding fathers were terrorists!
[00:54:57.603 --> 00:55:08.867]  And this ties into the Mayak Report and how anyone who believes that the Constitution isn't being followed, as Chris Matthews also smears us, are violent radicals.
[00:55:08.867 --> 00:55:12.529]  So we're going to go to the next call now, which is Miguel in New York.
[00:55:12.529 --> 00:55:14.789]  You are on the air.
[00:55:14.789 --> 00:55:17.170]  Hello?
[00:55:17.170 --> 00:55:17.811]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:55:17.811 --> 00:55:19.991]  OK, what's on your mind?
[00:55:22.222 --> 00:55:25.984]  What are we going to do after they take down the Internet?
[00:55:25.984 --> 00:55:32.668]  Because, you know, I have my friend who co-hosts a website and, you know, we're not conspiracy theorists.
[00:55:32.668 --> 00:55:33.889]  We just cover the facts.
[00:55:33.889 --> 00:55:35.970]  We just cover the facts that lead it out.
[00:55:35.970 --> 00:55:37.851]  So what are you going to do to implement Internet 2?
[00:55:40.629 --> 00:55:46.255]  Well, basically, they're going to first bring it in by censoring websites.
[00:55:46.255 --> 00:55:48.858]  They're not going to bring down the entire internet.
[00:55:48.858 --> 00:55:53.844]  They're just going to try and require people to get a license to operate a website.
[00:55:53.844 --> 00:55:58.149]  And if it comes to that, we're just going to have to go back to the old-fashioned methods.
[00:55:59.150 --> 00:56:03.877]  You know, there's a call in line for people to listen to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:56:03.877 --> 00:56:07.382]  We'll still be on conventional radio if they don't shut that down.
[00:56:07.382 --> 00:56:13.651]  And it's basically gonna go back to the days of pamphleteering and magazines and newsletters, I guess.
[00:56:15.112 --> 00:56:16.673]  I don't see them getting that through.
[00:56:16.673 --> 00:56:21.035]  There'll be a massive resistance against it and the way things are going.
[00:56:21.035 --> 00:56:24.056]  They have no momentum with which to push it through.
[00:56:24.056 --> 00:56:24.856]  Thanks for the call.
[00:56:24.856 --> 00:56:27.537]  We've got to move quick because we're nearing the end of the hour.
[00:56:27.537 --> 00:56:28.958]  And it's Janice in Texas.
[00:56:28.958 --> 00:56:31.719]  Janice, you're on the air.
[00:56:31.719 --> 00:56:32.239]  Hi, Paul.
[00:56:35.250 --> 00:56:49.676]  I moved to Central Texas, like in the middle of the hill country, and I look after my mom, who's like, oh, we're seeing these things in the sky, and we thought they were like UFOs, you know, whatever, and they're not.
[00:56:49.676 --> 00:57:02.602]  And I was, just let me finish here, I was at the gas station, and I saw this guy that was filling up all these gas tanks in this weird travel truck, and it said, uh, travel search, and I was like, what on earth?
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:04.661]  What sort of vehicle is that?
[00:57:04.661 --> 00:57:07.762]  And I asked him, I said, you know, what do you, what's travel search?
[00:57:07.762 --> 00:57:08.322]  What do you do?
[00:57:08.322 --> 00:57:11.523]  And he said, he said, oh, we look for people.
[00:57:11.523 --> 00:57:13.523]  And I said, you look for people?
[00:57:13.523 --> 00:57:14.724]  And he said, yeah.
[00:57:14.724 --> 00:57:16.024]  And I said, what do you mean?
[00:57:16.024 --> 00:57:17.945]  And he said, we run drones.
[00:57:17.945 --> 00:57:20.786]  There are drones, they're all over Texas.
[00:57:20.786 --> 00:57:23.487]  I mean, they're out every night.
[00:57:23.487 --> 00:57:30.789]  I'm just calling, I mean, I'm scared to death to even call because I see them outside and I'm just saying, it ain't coming, it's here.
[00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:33.120]  No, you're right.
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:42.944]  I mean, there's no doubt that, um, drones for law enforcement are already being practiced, um, and indeed used, um, in major American cities.
[00:57:42.944 --> 00:57:48.766]  Indeed, today, as we discussed earlier, it was announced that Predator drones would be used for law enforcement.
[00:57:48.766 --> 00:57:52.708]  So, there's no debate as to whether that's happening and that they're preparing for it.
[00:57:53.308 --> 00:58:08.714]  And it's going to be the next phase of this surveillance process against the American people, which is almost exclusively circled around making people afraid, making people scared, so that they're scared to even speak out in the first place.
[00:58:08.714 --> 00:58:15.917]  So you just have to get past the fear and go ahead and exercise your freedoms anyway, because if you do so, then
[00:58:16.717 --> 00:58:25.179]  The only step they can then take to stop that is, you know, by incarceration, and that will then expose them as the tyrants that they are.
[00:58:25.179 --> 00:58:26.560]  Thanks for the call, Janice.
[00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:28.180]  We're gonna go to Pat in Ohio.
[00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:29.901]  You're on the air.
[00:58:29.901 --> 00:58:32.241]  Hi, yeah, uh, Paul?
[00:58:32.241 --> 00:58:37.123]  I, um, this call, this call is regarding the, um, the BP oil spill.
[00:58:39.341 --> 00:58:40.382]  Okay, call back tomorrow.
[00:58:40.382 --> 00:58:41.282]  That's the end of the hour.
[00:58:41.282 --> 00:58:41.542]  Thank you.
[00:58:41.542 --> 00:58:46.285]  Number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:58:46.285 --> 00:58:50.707]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:50.707 --> 00:58:53.709]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:58:53.709 --> 00:58:59.052]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:58:59.052 --> 00:59:00.793]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:59:00.793 --> 00:59:06.116]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:59:06.116 --> 00:59:07.296]  How much do you want?
[00:59:07.296 --> 00:59:08.017]  When do you want it?
[00:59:08.397 --> 00:59:10.279]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:59:10.279 --> 00:59:11.360]  When will you need it?
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:13.561]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:59:13.561 --> 00:59:14.903]  Will there be any food?
[00:59:14.903 --> 00:59:16.424]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:59:16.424 --> 00:59:21.688]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:59:21.688 --> 00:59:24.831]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:59:25.271 --> 00:59:29.093]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:59:29.093 --> 00:59:30.313]  How much will you need?
[00:59:30.313 --> 00:59:31.234]  We don't know.
[00:59:31.234 --> 00:59:32.334]  How much do you want?
[00:59:32.334 --> 00:59:33.075]  All you can get.
[00:59:33.075 --> 00:59:34.355]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:34.355 --> 00:59:37.397]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:59:37.397 --> 00:59:39.197]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:39.197 --> 00:59:40.098]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:53.211 --> 00:59:55.612]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.612 --> 00:59:58.374]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:07.646 --> 01:00:10.588]  Well, we normally twist his arm to stay even longer than an hour.
[01:00:10.588 --> 01:00:14.632]  We can't do that today, because this is the last hour of the radio broadcast.
[01:00:14.632 --> 01:00:15.933]  We're always honored to have him.
[01:00:15.933 --> 01:00:19.015]  He just flew back in from Mexico last night into New York.
[01:00:19.015 --> 01:00:24.499]  He's kicking off his tour today, and we're honored to have him on with us for the next hour.
[01:00:24.499 --> 01:00:30.444]  I don't know what it was about that last interview, but I heard from Jesse's folks it was his favorite interview here on the show.
[01:00:30.444 --> 01:00:32.906]  Listeners said it was their favorite, the most views online.
[01:00:33.567 --> 01:00:36.373]  Really great interview we did just about a month ago.
[01:00:36.373 --> 01:00:39.040]  And now Governor Jesse Ventura is back with us today.
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:41.145]  The good news is, in fact here it is, here's the book.
[01:00:42.358 --> 01:00:43.539]  Down here on the floor.
[01:00:43.539 --> 01:00:48.502]  Jesse Ventura, American Conspiracies, has been as high as number four on the New York Times bestseller list.
[01:00:48.502 --> 01:00:51.503]  It's been holding up at seven in the top ten.
[01:00:51.503 --> 01:00:54.565]  And that shows the people are hungry for the truth.
[01:00:54.565 --> 01:00:58.567]  So I just want to say congratulations to Governor Jesse Ventura on another bestselling book.
[01:00:58.567 --> 01:01:03.770]  Well, thank you, Alex, and thanks for all the help, because you certainly help your show and listeners on that.
[01:01:03.770 --> 01:01:10.394]  But what's interesting, Alex, is that the book has not been reviewed by any book reviewer.
[01:01:12.655 --> 01:01:13.657]  Isn't that amazing?
[01:01:13.657 --> 01:01:20.468]  Here it's been in the New York Times Top Ten for four weeks now, I think, and not one reviewer has even reviewed the book.
[01:01:21.508 --> 01:01:22.889]  Well, I think that's an endorsement.
[01:01:22.889 --> 01:01:30.952]  Just like the Huffington Post censored your article about 9-11, even though they asked you to write it, now you're seeing censorship in the book world.
[01:01:30.952 --> 01:01:32.132]  That's unheard of.
[01:01:32.132 --> 01:01:36.113]  Four weeks, New York Times Top Ten, and no book reviews.
[01:01:36.113 --> 01:01:44.076]  Yeah, well, there's a few reviews on the internet, but there's been no reviews by any of the major media.
[01:01:44.076 --> 01:01:45.417]  No reviews of the book at all.
[01:01:45.817 --> 01:01:52.175]  I think it's a case, Alex, where they feel that if they review it, they give it credibility, so they're staying away from it.
[01:01:53.584 --> 01:01:54.205]  Unbelievable.
[01:01:54.205 --> 01:02:04.273]  We'll walk through some of the things that are covered in the book and why it's seen as controversial, but, you know, that's why the mainstream media is dying, is because people know they're acting as gatekeepers.
[01:02:04.273 --> 01:02:05.694]  Oh, there's no doubt about it.
[01:02:05.694 --> 01:02:15.823]  You know, they, uh, I just spoke earlier on another show, and they asked me why the mainstream media won't question the government.
[01:02:15.823 --> 01:02:20.807]  And I said, it's simple, because if they don't play along with the government, they get no access to them.
[01:02:21.873 --> 01:02:22.754]  It is the kiss of death.
[01:02:22.754 --> 01:02:24.554]  When we come back, I want to get into the war.
[01:02:24.554 --> 01:02:25.775]  We're now
[01:02:48.154 --> 01:02:51.218]  Well, first thing I'd like to ask you, Alex, is what the hell are we accomplishing?
[01:03:08.852 --> 01:03:10.954]  A bunch of weapon sales and oil?
[01:03:10.954 --> 01:03:14.096]  You know, that's the bottom line for me.
[01:03:14.096 --> 01:03:21.001]  And maybe I say this selfishly, but how if these two wars helped Jesse Ventura?
[01:03:21.001 --> 01:03:24.264]  Or how if these two wars helped Alex Jones?
[01:03:24.264 --> 01:03:29.007]  Or how if these two wars helped the average Joe citizen of this country?
[01:03:29.007 --> 01:03:36.693]  Other than bankrupting us, what is the ultimate goal that we will achieve to where we can all feel good about them?
[01:03:39.444 --> 01:03:40.025]  Absolutely.
[01:03:40.025 --> 01:03:42.226]  I mean, if our country was invaded, that'd be one thing.
[01:03:42.226 --> 01:03:45.789]  Or even if we were an evil empire and the empire gave us some of the booty.
[01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:50.973]  But no, we pay for it for offshore corporations that get the money and power.
[01:03:50.973 --> 01:03:52.113]  Exactly.
[01:03:52.113 --> 01:03:55.396]  And we're sitting here, our kids are dying over there.
[01:03:55.396 --> 01:03:58.698]  Well, you know what it clearly shows me, Alex?
[01:03:58.698 --> 01:04:04.102]  People should really wake up to the fact that the president ate in charge.
[01:04:04.102 --> 01:04:04.743]  That's a good point.
[01:04:06.677 --> 01:04:10.240]  See, Obama ran to get us out of the wars.
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:12.942]  He said he'd close down Gitmo.
[01:04:12.942 --> 01:04:19.206]  He said all of this stuff, and yet it's all gone the opposite way, hasn't it?
[01:04:19.206 --> 01:04:19.826]  It has.
[01:04:19.826 --> 01:04:21.728]  We're more into the wars.
[01:04:21.728 --> 01:04:23.509]  Gitmo's still here.
[01:04:23.509 --> 01:04:30.054]  So people should see clearly that the President is no longer in charge of the country.
[01:04:30.054 --> 01:04:33.236]  And then the next question is, what do we do to reverse that?
[01:04:34.634 --> 01:04:42.140]  And I've documented that the government's provocateuring militias and other groups to demonize the Tea Parties and any opposition to that.
[01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:45.843]  We'll talk about it all with former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura.
[01:04:45.843 --> 01:04:47.624]  His new book, a bestseller.
[01:04:47.624 --> 01:04:51.047]  Let's send it to number one on the New York Times bestseller list.
[01:04:51.047 --> 01:04:53.489]  It's in news stores everywhere.
[01:04:53.489 --> 01:04:54.350]  It's in airports.
[01:04:54.350 --> 01:04:55.251]  It's in bookstores.
[01:04:55.251 --> 01:04:58.613]  It's available at Infowars.com discounted.
[01:04:58.613 --> 01:04:59.234]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:01.311 --> 01:05:07.752]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[01:05:07.752 --> 01:05:13.013]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.

[01:06:59.617 --> 01:07:01.938]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:07:01.938 --> 01:07:04.318]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:07:04.318 --> 01:07:07.539]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:07:07.539 --> 01:07:12.621]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:07:12.621 --> 01:07:16.822]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:07:17.142 --> 01:07:19.486]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:07:19.486 --> 01:07:22.030]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:07:22.030 --> 01:07:25.294]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:07:25.294 --> 01:07:32.906]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:07:33.228 --> 01:07:38.611]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:07:38.611 --> 01:07:40.932]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:07:40.932 --> 01:07:45.154]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:07:45.154 --> 01:07:46.215]  And I got news for you.
[01:07:46.215 --> 01:07:47.556]  You're everyone else.
[01:07:47.556 --> 01:07:49.056]  Invisible Empire.

[01:08:01.142 --> 01:08:03.905]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.905 --> 01:08:14.133]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:14.133 --> 01:08:18.437]  Well, his television show got picked up for a second season record.
[01:08:18.437 --> 01:08:21.939]  First season on TruTV, their number one news show.
[01:08:21.939 --> 01:08:26.123]  And we're going to talk about, because I keep getting these questions, I know Jesse's wondering,
[01:08:26.790 --> 01:08:40.800]  With all this censorship, with all this control, not one major news book reviewer will talk about his number four on the New York Times bestseller list, American Conspiracies, four weeks in the top ten.
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:42.241]  So why is that being censored?
[01:08:42.241 --> 01:08:43.262]  Why do I get censored?
[01:08:43.262 --> 01:08:45.623]  But why is he allowed to have a TV show?
[01:08:45.623 --> 01:08:47.525]  We'll talk about that some coming up today.
[01:08:47.525 --> 01:08:49.386]  We'll talk about opium trafficking.
[01:08:49.386 --> 01:08:51.007]  We'll get into a whole host of issues.
[01:08:51.007 --> 01:08:52.348]  Pat Tillman, you name it.
[01:08:52.348 --> 01:08:55.991]  But Governor Jesse Ventura, for those who just joined us, we started getting into
[01:08:56.824 --> 01:09:16.026]  Eight years of Iraq, or seven years of Iraq, eight years of Afghanistan, no end in sight, new wars, they're expanding, all this footage coming out of reporters being massacred, being targeted, children being gunned down by Apache helicopters, premeditatedly, all of that happening, and we were discussing during the break
[01:09:17.879 --> 01:09:33.110]  Well, I really don't think he does, and what's really educated me, Alex, is I've been reading, I've read, I'm in the process of finishing my second book by Colonel Fletcher Prouty.
[01:09:34.426 --> 01:09:36.587]  And I highly recommend both of them.
[01:09:36.587 --> 01:09:38.648]  People need to read the Colonel's books.
[01:09:38.648 --> 01:09:41.669]  He died in 2001, in June.
[01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:48.052]  But if you read Fletcher Prouty's books, one of them is called The Secret Team, and the other one is called JFK.
[01:09:49.469 --> 01:09:57.276]  And if you read those two books it will become very clear that the history you've been taught is not the history of what's happened.
[01:09:57.276 --> 01:10:00.178]  And let me make my point here for a moment.
[01:10:00.178 --> 01:10:01.699]  Proudy was there.
[01:10:01.699 --> 01:10:06.963]  Who Fletcher Proudy was, do you remember the movie JFK by Oliver Storm of course?
[01:10:06.963 --> 01:10:07.584]  Yes.
[01:10:07.584 --> 01:10:09.746]  He is the Donald Sutherland character.
[01:10:11.357 --> 01:10:23.167]  He is the real-life Mr. X, the guy that Costner goes to Washington and talks to him on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, then they sit on that bench and he lays the whole thing out.
[01:10:23.167 --> 01:10:29.893]  Well, in real life, that was Colonel Leroy Fletcher Prouty, Colonel of the United States Air Force.
[01:10:29.893 --> 01:10:37.540]  And for, I think, 11 or 12 years, he was the top man, the liaison between the Pentagon and the CIA.
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:44.064]  And I can't tell people how much they need to read to understand.
[01:10:44.064 --> 01:10:54.794]  And when you read Prouty's books, you will become much more clear on what's happening because Prouty tells you in the books that the entire Cold War was a setup.
[01:10:57.052 --> 01:11:06.838]  There was a meeting that took place at the end of World War II, right before we technically were going to invade Japan, like Normandy.
[01:11:06.838 --> 01:11:10.440]  And then, of course, they dropped the two bombs and they didn't have to.
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:16.324]  But in preparing for that invasion, they moved massive armaments into Okinawa.
[01:11:17.248 --> 01:11:29.413]  Well, there was a meeting, because Prouty flew in Chiang Kai-shek, and it was between Chiang Kai-shek, who at that time was ahead of China, Stalin, Churchill, and Roosevelt.
[01:11:29.413 --> 01:11:34.995]  And at that point, it was determined that all wars from then on would be fought in third world countries.
[01:11:35.735 --> 01:11:42.661]  That there would be no direct objective that the military could achieve in which to declare victory.
[01:11:42.661 --> 01:11:45.924]  Now look back, Alex, in our history since World War II.
[01:11:45.924 --> 01:11:47.946]  Is that not all true?
[01:11:47.946 --> 01:11:49.707]  That is.
[01:11:49.707 --> 01:11:51.108]  It's all true.
[01:11:51.108 --> 01:11:54.511]  That's what really resonated with me when I read Prouty's books.
[01:11:54.511 --> 01:12:00.056]  I went, oh my God, the things he said here is exactly what has gone down.
[01:12:01.209 --> 01:12:02.229]  Well, let me be clear.
[01:12:02.229 --> 01:12:04.511]  They fought in third world countries.
[01:12:04.511 --> 01:12:08.352]  Oh, and remember them armaments that I told you they put in Okinawa?
[01:12:08.352 --> 01:12:10.273]  You know what became of those?
[01:12:10.273 --> 01:12:11.033]  No.
[01:12:11.033 --> 01:12:12.694]  They were split in half.
[01:12:12.694 --> 01:12:21.018]  Half of them, according to Colonel Prouty, half of them went to Korea and half of it went to Ho Chi Minh.
[01:12:21.018 --> 01:12:23.139]  They were setting up for the next two wars.
[01:12:24.705 --> 01:12:31.647]  Well, I'm chomping at the bit here and I want to sit back and shut up and you can tell us what you've learned, but this is what's so incredible.
[01:12:31.647 --> 01:12:32.207]  I've known you
[01:12:44.847 --> 01:13:09.823]  For about four and a half years now, and the process, you knew about Gulf of Tonkin, you knew about the lives of Vietnam, you were very well informed, you've been visited by the CIA when you were governor, but it's been a process of you reading and researching, and now to see you, I interviewed Prouty, had to be like in 1997, we've been digging around looking for the tapes, and I have read over his work, I've read his first book, not the second one you're talking about,
[01:13:10.383 --> 01:13:25.049]  And then you discover that Joe McCarthy was actually right, but he was being used to set up a police state domestically with low-level communists, but as soon as he found out the Pentagon was running everything, remember that was what they said was so absurd?
[01:13:25.049 --> 01:13:35.653]  Then they set him up and destroyed him, and used the term McCarthyism to demonize him, but then it was declassified seven years ago, or six years ago, that the Russians said, no it's true, he was right.
[01:13:35.653 --> 01:13:36.293]  And then you learn
[01:13:36.653 --> 01:13:41.036]  That the whole geopolitical system is a war against individual populations.
[01:13:41.036 --> 01:13:44.298]  There was a deal with the Russians to build up their police state.
[01:13:44.298 --> 01:13:45.999]  They would take over half the world.
[01:13:45.999 --> 01:13:46.619]  The U.S.
[01:13:46.619 --> 01:13:58.246]  would build up its police state and military system and take over its other half and go into these black hole wars to then militarize a cadre of men to come back and take over the domestic country itself.
[01:13:58.246 --> 01:14:00.107]  And now you're researching that, Governor.
[01:14:00.107 --> 01:14:01.248]  It's so exciting.
[01:14:01.248 --> 01:14:04.670]  Well, you know, the thing is now is this, Alex.
[01:14:04.670 --> 01:14:06.091]  I have the time to do it now.
[01:14:07.617 --> 01:14:20.616]  You know, when you're being a governor, or you're governing a state, or you're working in that capacity, you don't have time to do any research because your day is full of 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, just doing your job.
[01:14:21.519 --> 01:14:22.620]  Well, I want to be specific.
[01:14:40.155 --> 01:14:49.619]  It's amazing to see your development, and I'm not like on some mountain saying that, because I've noticed your discernment with issues getting into the whole conspiracy realm.
[01:14:49.619 --> 01:15:03.945]  You go right to the best sources, the best documents, the best history, and it's just very exciting, Governor Ventura, to see you with a hit TV show, a best-selling book, and to really be one of the main leaders now of questioning our reality.
[01:15:04.665 --> 01:15:05.565]  I don't want to interrupt.
[01:15:05.565 --> 01:15:09.786]  Go back, give people the name of the book again because I want to go by it and read it.
[01:15:09.786 --> 01:15:14.707]  Fletcher Prouty, on record, the head of Black Ops between the Pentagon and CIA.
[01:15:14.707 --> 01:15:20.969]  He was sent away, you know, to the Arctic when they killed JFK.
[01:15:20.969 --> 01:15:25.710]  He talked about how they pulled the security off, how it was a Pentagon Black Ops job.
[01:15:25.710 --> 01:15:34.052]  We're going to play a clip from JFK coming up later, but take your time in the break with more of what you've learned and how you tie that in to all your other life knowledge.
[01:15:35.131 --> 01:15:47.040]  Well, again, it's a case that, uh, you know, Fletcher Prouty just, uh, he lived through it, and, uh, I enjoy reading what he knows about, and he's an exceptionally bright guy.
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:16:01.071]  See, the other thing he shows very clearly, which tells you how Obama isn't really in charge, Prouty shows you that most of the politicians only learn of these events until they're already in motion.
[01:16:02.836 --> 01:16:07.300]  They're set in motion by people in the government.
[01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:14.527]  You know, people in the CIA, at lower- you know, not the high-level positions, but in the secondary positions.
[01:16:14.527 --> 01:16:17.069]  They're the ones that move forward on all this stuff.
[01:16:17.069 --> 01:16:26.958]  The wars, every- all the dirty stuff that goes on, so that by the time our elected politicians are briefed on it, this thing's already halfway to life.
[01:16:26.958 --> 01:16:28.039]  It's already happening.
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:33.007]  So they really, our politicians are playing catch up.
[01:16:33.007 --> 01:16:37.755]  And that's what Rowdy explains in that book, The Secret Team.
[01:16:37.755 --> 01:16:39.457]  That's who The Secret Team is.
[01:16:40.757 --> 01:16:46.963]  The secret team are these right-under-level government people who are literally running amok.
[01:16:46.963 --> 01:16:49.505]  And there's nobody in control of them.
[01:16:49.505 --> 01:16:54.789]  And, uh, you know, the CIA has its own money now and own money sources.
[01:16:54.789 --> 01:16:57.532]  So they can basically do anything they want.
[01:16:57.532 --> 01:17:00.955]  And our president and the rest of them seem to be powerless to them.
[01:17:01.437 --> 01:17:03.959]  Well, that's what Ron Paul said two months ago in a speech.
[01:17:03.959 --> 01:17:05.240]  In fact, we'll cue that up.
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:06.340]  It's about 20 seconds.
[01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:08.922]  He said, we've had a CIA coup since the 60s.
[01:17:08.922 --> 01:17:10.283]  They're bringing in the drugs.
[01:17:10.283 --> 01:17:11.704]  We have a shadow government.
[01:17:11.704 --> 01:17:26.513]  And my whole point is we have to come to the point as a nation to realize presidents come and go, but the secret teams run by the big Wall Street banks that set up the CIA rule this country, and by extension, the world.
[01:17:26.513 --> 01:17:27.354]  Yeah, pretty much.
[01:17:29.864 --> 01:17:34.185]  At least that's the information that I'm arriving at.
[01:17:34.185 --> 01:17:39.867]  It's not a nice arrival, but, you know, what can we do?
[01:17:39.867 --> 01:17:42.848]  Well, I've been harping on it for about 12 years, Alex.
[01:17:42.848 --> 01:17:47.289]  You can start by stop voting for Democrats and Republicans.
[01:17:47.289 --> 01:17:48.730]  I don't care who you vote for.
[01:17:48.730 --> 01:17:50.430]  Don't vote for them.
[01:17:50.430 --> 01:17:51.311]  They're the problem.
[01:17:51.311 --> 01:17:52.331]  They're not the solution.
[01:17:54.145 --> 01:17:57.047]  And that's, you know, really, it gets to that.
[01:17:57.047 --> 01:17:59.588]  Then, of course, you have to question, is the voting real?
[01:17:59.588 --> 01:18:10.093]  Because with these electronic voting machines, they can be hacked into, so you've got to question whether your votes are actually legitimate even in this country anymore.
[01:18:10.093 --> 01:18:11.574]  Exactly.
[01:18:11.574 --> 01:18:14.395]  Let me back you up, what you just said.
[01:18:14.395 --> 01:18:15.596]  You take Gulf of Tonkin.
[01:18:15.596 --> 01:18:21.919]  I sat through many hours of LBJ at his ranch outside Austin, Johnson City, a couple miles from where I sit.
[01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:24.492]  Exactly, and you gotta understand too, it ain't McNamara.
[01:18:24.492 --> 01:18:25.833]  McNamara's being briefed too.
[01:18:47.111 --> 01:18:49.553]  He probably only learned about it the week ahead of LBJ.
[01:18:49.553 --> 01:18:49.773]  Yup.
[01:18:49.773 --> 01:18:51.073]  And see, he's been briefed.
[01:18:51.073 --> 01:18:54.656]  See, Fletcher Prouty said the key to all this are these briefer guys.
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:18.269]  These guys that the Pentagon has and the CIA have, who do the briefings of the politicians, they're the ones who sell the politician on the policy.
[01:19:18.269 --> 01:19:19.730]  And it comes from them.
[01:19:19.730 --> 01:19:21.051]  You ought to interview Ray McGovern.
[01:19:21.051 --> 01:19:26.334]  He was a top CIA briefer to Reagan and Bush I, and he agrees with everything you're saying.
[01:19:26.334 --> 01:19:32.719]  Yeah, well, that's what Fletcher Prouty said, and I haven't found a thing he's been wrong with yet.
[01:19:32.719 --> 01:19:33.660]  No, it's all accurate.
[01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:34.240]  Incredible.
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:35.041]  Jesse Ventura.
[01:19:36.436 --> 01:19:44.379]  Always wise, always informed, but just to know that he is really on the fast track to the key to planetary control.
[01:19:44.379 --> 01:19:46.200]  It's all staged.
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:47.040]  In the past it was.
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:49.201]  There is a split between Russia now, it appears.
[01:19:49.201 --> 01:19:53.442]  But in the past, all rigged, two empires carving up the world.
[01:19:53.442 --> 01:19:55.283]  We'll be right back with Governor Jesse Ventura.
[01:20:02.011 --> 01:20:02.772]  The problem.
[01:20:02.772 --> 01:20:05.336]  How do I cook food without power?

[01:20:10.743 --> 01:20:13.247]  How can I make safe drinking water?
[01:20:13.247 --> 01:20:19.155]  When your power goes out, the solution for cooking, baking, home lighting, listening to the radio, and producing clean water.

[01:22:02.116 --> 01:22:03.157]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:22:03.157 --> 01:22:08.678]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[01:22:08.678 --> 01:22:09.218]  I get it.
[01:22:09.218 --> 01:22:18.580]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:20.261]  That's not what's happening.
[01:22:20.261 --> 01:22:28.726]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[01:22:28.726 --> 01:22:32.128]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:22:32.128 --> 01:22:36.390]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:37.991]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:22:37.991 --> 01:22:41.393]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[01:22:41.393 --> 01:22:45.776]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:22:45.776 --> 01:22:46.436]  You should, too.
[01:22:46.656 --> 01:22:47.818]  Find out what they know.
[01:22:47.818 --> 01:22:51.123]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.

[01:22:51.183 --> 01:22:51.504]  800-686-2237.
[01:22:51.504 --> 01:22:51.704]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:01.633 --> 01:23:02.773]  Fatigue.
[01:23:02.773 --> 01:23:03.893]  Headaches.
[01:23:03.893 --> 01:23:05.234]  Allergies and asthma.
[01:23:05.234 --> 01:23:06.654]  Chronic disease.
[01:23:06.654 --> 01:23:08.494]  Is your home making you sick?
[01:23:08.494 --> 01:23:09.435]  Here's a fact.
[01:23:09.435 --> 01:23:11.475]  Our indoor air quality is getting worse.
[01:23:11.475 --> 01:23:17.416]  And the causes include chemicals, toxic gases, dust, pollen, dander, and even chemtrail particulates.
[01:23:17.416 --> 01:23:24.618]  To rid your home of these contaminants, get the best-priced air purifiers in the industry at airfiltersandpurifiers.com.
[01:23:24.618 --> 01:23:27.538]  Our air purifiers are specialized to fit your needs.
[01:23:27.538 --> 01:23:30.939]  From allergy sufferers, to the sleep deprived, to the chemically sensitive.
[01:23:30.939 --> 01:23:31.399]  And with no
[01:23:31.459 --> 01:23:32.120]  We're good to go.
[01:24:11.758 --> 01:24:15.642]  You know, I wish people could hear our behind-the-scenes discussions.
[01:24:15.642 --> 01:24:18.184]  Governor Jesse Ventura is our guest.
[01:24:18.184 --> 01:24:23.169]  Jesse, you're always a serious guy, but lately you have really seemed happy.
[01:24:23.169 --> 01:24:24.730]  Why are you so happy?
[01:24:24.730 --> 01:24:26.412]  Mexico does that to me, Alex.
[01:24:27.745 --> 01:24:32.208]  When I get down there, you know, I spent Friday and Saturday, the waves were great.
[01:24:32.208 --> 01:24:36.871]  They were running about three, three and a half feet, and they were coming in perfect for surfing.
[01:24:36.871 --> 01:24:40.754]  So I had good, great days of surfing down there.
[01:24:40.754 --> 01:24:46.358]  And whenever I can live that lifestyle, I get very content and very pleased with the world.
[01:24:47.208 --> 01:24:48.129]  I hear you.
[01:24:48.129 --> 01:24:51.752]  And first you have the tsunami and then the earthquake, but no problems.
[01:24:51.752 --> 01:24:53.554]  No, I didn't even feel the earthquake.
[01:24:53.554 --> 01:24:58.738]  The earthquake happened way up by Mexicali, which is right on the border of Mexico and California.
[01:24:58.738 --> 01:25:03.443]  Oh, I do want to... Here's one thing when we talk that, Alex, that I wanted to word out to people on.
[01:25:03.443 --> 01:25:05.664]  Please allow me to do it here.
[01:25:05.664 --> 01:25:13.952]  Everyone out there that knows anyone in the state of California, please encourage them this fall to vote for the legalization of marijuana.
[01:25:15.931 --> 01:25:18.032]  It's gonna be on the ballot in California.
[01:25:18.032 --> 01:25:22.753]  Full legalization to where marijuana would be treated like alcohol and tobacco.
[01:25:22.753 --> 01:25:29.474]  And the reason I'm pleading with people to support this is to stop the carnage at the border.
[01:25:29.474 --> 01:25:32.135]  Alex, it's awful.
[01:25:32.135 --> 01:25:34.195]  17,000 people have died on the Mexican-U.S.
[01:25:34.195 --> 01:25:35.616]  border just in the last year.
[01:25:35.616 --> 01:25:36.456]  I know.
[01:25:36.456 --> 01:25:37.516]  It's a war zone.
[01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:40.461]  We can end it.
[01:25:40.461 --> 01:25:42.662]  We can end it by simply legalizing.
[01:25:42.662 --> 01:25:45.023]  Because that puts the cartels out of business.
[01:25:45.023 --> 01:25:46.664]  They have nothing to sell them.
[01:25:46.664 --> 01:25:47.904]  But that's common sense.
[01:25:47.904 --> 01:25:50.606]  All these fake conservatives say, that's of the devil.
[01:25:50.606 --> 01:25:57.769]  Meanwhile, the CIA wants to keep all the drugs illegal so they have an excuse to put people in prison and so they can launder the money.
[01:25:57.769 --> 01:25:58.469]  Exactly.
[01:25:58.469 --> 01:25:59.530]  But see, we've got it.
[01:25:59.530 --> 01:26:02.771]  Here's a chance where we've got it in the palm of our hand, Alex.
[01:26:02.771 --> 01:26:05.613]  If the election is legitimate out in California,
[01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:12.048]  The people out there can vote for the first step, full legalization of marijuana.
[01:26:12.048 --> 01:26:16.936]  And I think if you see California do it, it'll go like wildfire right across the country.
[01:26:17.854 --> 01:26:18.574]  Absolutely.
[01:26:18.574 --> 01:26:20.776]  So you heard it here, folks.
[01:26:20.776 --> 01:26:25.458]  Vote for the decriminalization, legalization of marijuana in California.
[01:26:25.458 --> 01:26:26.759]  Here's a Reuters article.
[01:26:26.759 --> 01:26:30.220]  NATO rejects Russian call for Afghan poppy spraying.
[01:26:30.220 --> 01:26:41.326]  NATO Wednesday rejected Russian calls for it to eradicate opium poppy fields in Afghanistan, saying the best way for Moscow to help control the drug would be to give more assistance against the insurgency.
[01:26:41.326 --> 01:26:43.227]  Then I was listening to BBC a few months ago,
[01:26:44.059 --> 01:26:44.299]  Well...
[01:26:59.801 --> 01:27:02.122]  You know, look at it this way, Alex.
[01:27:02.122 --> 01:27:07.265]  The major banks, the international banks of the world, where do you think all that money goes?
[01:27:07.265 --> 01:27:13.267]  Millions and billions of dollars for the heroin trade gets laundered through.
[01:27:13.267 --> 01:27:15.348]  And look at the timing of it.
[01:27:15.348 --> 01:27:21.091]  The Wall Street crash happened right at the time the Taliban put the poppy growers out of business.
[01:27:23.191 --> 01:27:26.954]  Because all, and there may be a correlation there.
[01:27:26.954 --> 01:27:29.435]  You're talking about 2000, 2001?
[01:27:29.435 --> 01:27:36.720]  These billions of dollars of laundered drug money, and that could very well have hurt the cash flow of these banks.
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:45.066]  And that very well could have been, I'm not saying it's the full thing, but it certainly could have been part of the catalyst that made the Wall Street crash happen in 08.
[01:27:47.546 --> 01:27:53.130]  Well, there's also the fact that the Taliban was cutting it off in 2000-2001, and you had the crash of 2001.
[01:27:53.130 --> 01:27:53.571]  Yep.
[01:27:53.571 --> 01:28:03.218]  Notice how every time the drugs get cut off, it seems well street crash was shortly thereafter.
[01:28:03.218 --> 01:28:09.163]  Well, you're right on that front again, but how can they just be in Reuters saying, we're not going to eradicate any poppy fields?
[01:28:09.163 --> 01:28:10.684]  I mean, how obvious is that?
[01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:16.299]  Well, it's the old thing of the way we fight the wars today.
[01:28:16.299 --> 01:28:21.172]  You know, sometimes the people you get in bed with are worse than the people you're fighting.
[01:28:22.717 --> 01:28:24.839]  You're absolutely right.
[01:28:24.839 --> 01:28:34.007]  Governor Jesse Ventura, I have a lot of questions that I want to ask here on my list, but going out to break on this short segment, what else do you want to relay to this audience that you think is important?
[01:28:34.007 --> 01:28:42.695]  Well, again, just to be vigilant and pay attention and to question your government at all times, because it needs to be questioned.
[01:28:42.695 --> 01:28:48.460]  Right now, like I said, it should be clear to everyone that Barack Obama is not in charge.
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:50.962]  I don't believe that he is now.
[01:28:50.962 --> 01:28:55.908]  Because you see, everything that he ran on, he hasn't come through on virtually anything.
[01:28:55.908 --> 01:28:58.691]  He's now in the opposite camp, really.
[01:28:58.691 --> 01:29:08.782]  And it's almost like he arrived there with this fresh, clean agenda, and it was like they took him to the woodshed and told him, well, you might be the president, but you don't run things.
[01:29:09.508 --> 01:29:10.208]  Well, certainly.
[01:29:10.208 --> 01:29:11.369]  Plus, they finance him.
[01:29:11.369 --> 01:29:12.449]  They finance McCain.
[01:29:12.449 --> 01:29:14.510]  No matter who gets in, they control him.
[01:29:14.510 --> 01:29:15.610]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[01:29:15.610 --> 01:29:21.333]  You know, you look at Obama's biggest contributor was Goldman Sachs.
[01:29:21.333 --> 01:29:28.376]  And they're the ones that, what is it, the last five or six Department of Treasury secretaries have all come out of there?
[01:29:28.376 --> 01:29:29.256]  And absolutely.
[01:29:29.256 --> 01:29:31.577]  And then you look at Chile, Iceland,
[01:29:33.019 --> 01:29:40.505]  You look at Greece, you look at all these countries, first world, second world, they're all run by Goldman Sachs people.
[01:29:40.505 --> 01:29:42.526]  That's the key heart to this group.
[01:29:42.526 --> 01:29:46.189]  A ton of questions straight ahead for Governor Jesse Ventura.
[01:29:46.189 --> 01:29:47.429]  The book is a bestseller.
[01:29:47.429 --> 01:29:51.152]  Get it at Infowars.com and get your choice of a free film.
[01:29:51.152 --> 01:29:55.075]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.075 --> 01:29:57.757]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.418 --> 01:30:02.060]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:05.423]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.

[01:30:21.735 --> 01:30:24.376]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[01:30:24.376 --> 01:30:30.898]  Since 1947, Calvin's Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.

[01:30:52.915 --> 01:30:53.576]  Thank you!
[01:31:00.049 --> 01:31:05.032]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:31:05.032 --> 01:31:06.033]  What have we got?
[01:31:06.033 --> 01:31:08.474]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:31:08.474 --> 01:31:09.475]  A republic.
[01:31:09.475 --> 01:31:12.137]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:31:12.137 --> 01:31:14.398]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:31:14.398 --> 01:31:16.419]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:31:16.419 --> 01:31:18.100]  So they think they own our land?
[01:31:18.100 --> 01:31:19.421]  They think they own our water?
[01:31:19.421 --> 01:31:20.021]  Children?
[01:31:20.021 --> 01:31:21.142]  Our education?
[01:31:21.142 --> 01:31:21.963]  Our money?
[01:31:21.963 --> 01:31:25.625]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:31:25.985 --> 01:31:30.972]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:31:30.972 --> 01:31:31.993]  We have the facts.
[01:31:31.993 --> 01:31:33.154]  We have the Constitution.
[01:31:33.154 --> 01:31:34.056]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:31:34.056 --> 01:31:34.957]  We have common law.
[01:31:34.957 --> 01:31:37.460]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:37.460 --> 01:31:41.245]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:31:41.345 --> 01:31:46.310]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:47.792]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:31:47.792 --> 01:31:48.893]  Don't tread on me.
[01:31:48.893 --> 01:31:54.979]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:31:59.864 --> 01:32:04.426]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:04.426 --> 01:32:05.326]  Number 1.
[01:32:05.326 --> 01:32:08.768]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:08.768 --> 01:32:09.628]  Number 2.
[01:32:09.628 --> 01:32:14.510]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:14.510 --> 01:32:15.250]  It's true.
[01:32:15.250 --> 01:32:20.133]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.133 --> 01:32:20.953]  Number 3.
[01:32:20.953 --> 01:32:24.534]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:24.534 --> 01:32:28.236]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:28.436 --> 01:32:29.236]  Number 4.
[01:32:29.236 --> 01:32:31.997]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:31.997 --> 01:32:35.678]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:35.678 --> 01:32:36.458]  Number 5.
[01:32:36.458 --> 01:32:40.619]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:40.619 --> 01:32:45.661]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:45.661 --> 01:32:49.842]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:49.842 --> 01:32:51.623]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:51.623 --> 01:32:56.224]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:32:56.584 --> 01:32:58.765]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen, Tuesday, the 6th day of April, 2010.
[01:33:15.837 --> 01:33:21.300]  Jesse Ventura, an icon of true political independence in this country and worldwide, is our guest.
[01:33:21.300 --> 01:33:23.982]  And I'm really honored to have him and honored to count him as a friend.
[01:33:23.982 --> 01:33:24.843]  He's a great guy.
[01:33:24.843 --> 01:33:26.023]  He's for real.
[01:33:26.023 --> 01:33:28.905]  And I want to get into how did he get his TV show on air?
[01:33:28.905 --> 01:33:33.168]  We talked about this last time and he marveled, but now we see the censorship of his book.
[01:33:33.168 --> 01:33:36.710]  No book reviews, even though it's number four on the New York Times bestseller list.
[01:33:36.710 --> 01:33:37.711]  How did that happen?
[01:33:37.711 --> 01:33:39.011]  We're going to talk about that in a moment.
[01:33:39.011 --> 01:33:39.552]  But first,
[01:33:40.152 --> 01:33:52.869]  Governor, I got an email from a lady saying effective immediately she's never listening to my radio show again because I played the gun pod footage from the Apaches killing these reporters, shooting these kids, laughing about it.
[01:33:53.542 --> 01:33:57.064]  And then lying about it later, all these other massacre videos.
[01:33:57.064 --> 01:33:58.725]  Here's the New York Times today.
[01:33:58.725 --> 01:33:59.005]  U.S.
[01:33:59.005 --> 01:34:02.547]  forces horrifying Afghanistan cover-up.
[01:34:02.547 --> 01:34:08.890]  Obviously, we're not saying the individual troops are all bad, but Pat Tillman went over there, found that it was a fraud, wrote letters home.
[01:34:08.890 --> 01:34:10.050]  That's a show you should do.
[01:34:10.050 --> 01:34:11.091]  I talked to some of his family.
[01:34:11.091 --> 01:34:11.811]  They wouldn't come on air.
[01:34:11.811 --> 01:34:13.072]  They believe it was a hit.
[01:34:13.072 --> 01:34:15.353]  The evidence came out they did cover up the Friendly Fire.
[01:34:15.353 --> 01:34:18.455]  They killed him up at point-blank range, three shots in the head.
[01:34:18.455 --> 01:34:22.837]  I mean, as Fletcher Pouty wrote, and he ran black ops,
[01:34:23.357 --> 01:34:24.678]  We propped up the Soviets.
[01:34:24.678 --> 01:34:25.699]  We set it all up.
[01:34:25.699 --> 01:34:26.520]  It's staged.
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:28.742]  It's eating our entire system.
[01:34:28.742 --> 01:34:32.965]  Is it unpatriotic to criticize corrupt illegal wars?
[01:34:32.965 --> 01:34:34.406]  No, it's not.
[01:34:34.406 --> 01:34:36.428]  You know, we went through this in Vietnam.
[01:34:36.428 --> 01:34:40.672]  I would think that this country would have a little bit longer memory.
[01:34:42.064 --> 01:34:47.709]  The same type of affair took place in Vietnam, where you have the massacre at My Lai.
[01:34:47.709 --> 01:34:54.515]  You know, people, and believe me, I'm not blaming the soldiers, I'm blaming the politicians.
[01:34:54.515 --> 01:34:57.077]  Because it's ultimately their fault.
[01:34:57.077 --> 01:35:02.301]  You know, war is the result of failed policy, failed politics.
[01:35:02.301 --> 01:35:04.463]  And the end result is war.
[01:35:04.463 --> 01:35:08.266]  And so when your politicians fail you, you go to war.
[01:35:09.887 --> 01:35:14.790]  Because of their failure, they put our young men and women into these wars.
[01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:20.954]  Well, what they did, of course, what they did is not good, but let's remember something.
[01:35:20.954 --> 01:35:25.857]  Some of these guys are on their fifth, sixth, and seventh tour over there.
[01:35:25.857 --> 01:35:27.318]  They've been hardened now.
[01:35:27.318 --> 01:35:28.478]  They've been changed.
[01:35:28.478 --> 01:35:31.140]  They are not the same people that left.
[01:35:31.140 --> 01:35:33.061]  Trust me on that.
[01:35:33.061 --> 01:35:37.464]  And so, war, there is nothing great and glorious about war.
[01:35:38.308 --> 01:35:42.113]  War is the worst thing man's ever come up with.
[01:35:42.113 --> 01:35:44.296]  And that's killing each other over what?
[01:35:44.296 --> 01:35:45.657]  Political reasons?
[01:35:45.657 --> 01:35:46.779]  Religion?
[01:35:46.779 --> 01:35:51.625]  Whatever stupidity we might decide to go to war and murder each other over?
[01:35:52.529 --> 01:35:59.998]  And so, no, you are not wrong in showing this, because what's wrong is sheltering people from it.
[01:35:59.998 --> 01:36:11.913]  That's why these wars are going on, Alex, is because the American people have been sheltered, the media is not portraying what's happening over there, and they're not even showing the body bags when they come home.
[01:36:13.743 --> 01:36:19.866]  Well, you're absolutely right, and you talked about Fletcher Prouty, who ran Black Ops in the Pentagon.
[01:36:19.866 --> 01:36:23.287]  That's on record the liaison to the CIA.
[01:36:23.287 --> 01:36:35.213]  And he's documenting how they made the decision at the end of World War II to attack third world countries, to divide them, to never have an outcome, so the armaments industries could make a lot of money and get a lot of power.
[01:36:35.213 --> 01:36:39.095]  And then we sit here and say that's exactly what Afghanistan and Iraq are.
[01:36:39.095 --> 01:36:41.316]  We know this is the policy of divide and conquer.
[01:36:41.876 --> 01:36:55.608]  We know they're turning our country into a militarized surveillance police state, and it's our right as citizens to say that we don't want to be part of these illegal wars that George Washington said that we shouldn't be involved in foreign wars.
[01:36:55.608 --> 01:37:01.574]  Well, again, I guess sometimes a war is justified, you know.
[01:37:01.574 --> 01:37:08.400]  There are occasions, you know, where a war you've got to go fight because there may be a tyrant like Adolf Hitler out there.
[01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:11.564]  And that type of situation.
[01:37:11.564 --> 01:37:17.617]  But, ever since World War II, you cannot tell me one word that has been justified.
[01:37:18.340 --> 01:37:21.141]  But you talked about it being a failed policy.
[01:37:21.141 --> 01:37:27.783]  Failed from our perspective, but if we know they're premeditated to be quagmires to make money, then it's not a failed policy.
[01:37:27.783 --> 01:37:35.586]  You know, they say the war on drugs is a failure, there's more drugs, more people in prison, but for the big banks and the military-industrial complex, that's a success.
[01:37:35.586 --> 01:37:38.347]  Oh yeah, very much so.
[01:37:38.347 --> 01:37:42.188]  People need to always remember there are profiteers at war.
[01:37:42.188 --> 01:37:46.950]  There are people that wait for war because they become exceptionally wealthy.
[01:37:48.158 --> 01:37:49.619]  When there's worse thought.
[01:37:49.619 --> 01:37:58.587]  And these are the people that lead, these are the lobbyists that get those secret team guys at that level of government to move forward.
[01:37:58.587 --> 01:38:01.890]  Like, here's what Prouty also brings out very clearly.
[01:38:01.890 --> 01:38:05.353]  He brings out the fraud of the CIA.
[01:38:05.353 --> 01:38:09.917]  We all believe the CIA is there to gather intelligence, right?
[01:38:09.917 --> 01:38:10.517]  Yes.
[01:38:10.517 --> 01:38:13.500]  Well, Prouty says that's about 10% of what they do.
[01:38:14.449 --> 01:38:20.320]  The other 90% is carrying out these military agendas and creating the wars.
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:21.642]  And assassinations.
[01:38:21.642 --> 01:38:22.224]  Yeah.
[01:38:22.224 --> 01:38:23.786]  Well, that's what helps create the wars.
[01:38:25.078 --> 01:38:30.143]  See, they were designed by Harry Truman to not set policy.
[01:38:30.143 --> 01:38:35.489]  They were supposedly to be there only to provide information for the President.
[01:38:35.489 --> 01:38:48.021]  And Allen Dulles, Prouty makes it very clear that Allen Dulles, and of course he's neck deep a member of the Warren Commission and all that on Kennedy, Allen Dulles is the one that created today's CIA.
[01:38:49.202 --> 01:38:51.905]  Where do you see this going?
[01:38:51.905 --> 01:38:56.470]  Because I have a Bloomberg report here in my stack where the federal government is telling
[01:39:10.964 --> 01:39:12.746]  I believe they're trying to destroy the middle class.
[01:39:12.746 --> 01:39:15.328]  Because we're the only country that's ever really had one.
[01:39:36.205 --> 01:39:44.011]  That's always been the American dream, is that you can rise from poverty in this country and you can become a millionaire.
[01:39:44.011 --> 01:39:47.333]  Well, that dream is vanishing quickly.
[01:39:47.333 --> 01:39:51.956]  There is not going to be a middle class in about 15 years, I don't believe.
[01:39:51.956 --> 01:39:53.997]  There will just be rich and poor.
[01:39:53.997 --> 01:39:57.640]  And therefore, we will be like every other country around the globe.
[01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:02.083]  And maybe, Alex, it's being done to globalize Mexico, Canada, and us.
[01:40:02.973 --> 01:40:09.618]  Absolutely, North American Union, that way people are so poor they can't ever resist the ruling class.
[01:40:09.618 --> 01:40:10.638]  Here's that Bloomberg article.
[01:40:10.638 --> 01:40:12.800]  They've got to bring us down to Mexico's level.
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:15.362]  Exactly, that's what the globalists say.
[01:40:15.362 --> 01:40:22.987]  In fact, there's a clip we have of Obama where he says, in this new world order, no nation can be above another.
[01:40:22.987 --> 01:40:25.709]  But that doesn't mean raise the third world.
[01:40:25.709 --> 01:40:28.450]  In the globalist documents, they want to lower everybody.
[01:40:28.450 --> 01:40:31.953]  Yeah, no, they would rather lower us down to the third world level.
[01:40:32.786 --> 01:40:33.228]  Unbelievable.
[01:40:37.148 --> 01:40:40.070]  Let's read this Bloomberg headline for folks that are doubting me.
[01:40:40.070 --> 01:40:43.752]  Failed banks may get pension fund backing as FDIC seeks cash.
[01:40:43.752 --> 01:40:56.420]  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is trying to encourage public retirement funds that control more than $2 trillion to buy all or part of failed lenders' assets, taking on a more direct role in propping up banking systems.
[01:40:56.420 --> 01:40:58.822]  And it talks about how the regulators are ordering them to do it.
[01:40:58.822 --> 01:41:05.186]  Since when do regulators order private and public pension funds to be invested in the failed banks?
[01:41:11.695 --> 01:41:15.140]  Well, the government says, Jesse, they want to grab your 401k and give it to the bankers.
[01:41:25.393 --> 01:41:27.793]  Well, I know they've been setting up for it and infiltrating.
[01:41:27.793 --> 01:41:41.416]  I know they infiltrated these militias and set them up to create the illusion that there's about to be all this domestic terror, and I believe they're getting ready to stage terror attacks, Governor, to blame it on the American people, to use NORTHCOM against the American people.
[01:41:41.416 --> 01:41:41.976]  So that what?
[01:41:41.976 --> 01:41:46.057]  They could empower themselves into a martial law type situation?
[01:41:46.057 --> 01:41:52.838]  I know they've been making preparations for two decades in earnest, starting with Oliver North, and I know I've never seen such a build-up towards it.
[01:41:53.411 --> 01:41:54.372]  Okay.
[01:41:54.372 --> 01:41:57.776]  Well, it's something we all gotta be aware of.
[01:41:57.776 --> 01:41:58.657]  Without a doubt.
[01:41:58.657 --> 01:42:05.325]  But, you know, there's still us, all the masses out there, and we're still very powerful.
[01:42:05.325 --> 01:42:08.308]  The only thing is, we have to learn to use our power.
[01:42:08.308 --> 01:42:12.553]  Well, you've got a powerful voice as a political icon, an independent, a former governor.
[01:42:13.550 --> 01:42:24.996]  What would you say to the American people if we see some terror attacks, they're blamed on the American people, and they start trying to use these different enemy combatant acts, belligerent acts, to start grabbing U.S.
[01:42:24.996 --> 01:42:25.996]  citizens?
[01:42:25.996 --> 01:42:30.279]  Well, you know, I think the first thing we need to do is this.
[01:42:30.279 --> 01:42:36.922]  I think we need to put huge pressure on the Obama administration to rescind the Patriot Act.
[01:42:37.461 --> 01:42:38.322]  Yes.
[01:42:38.322 --> 01:42:46.134]  I think that would be the great starting point for people to start marching and demanding that the Patriot Act be abolished.
[01:42:47.816 --> 01:43:09.872]  Because the Patriot Act is the thing that's taking away our freedoms, it's taking away habeas corpus, where they could arrest you, simply say you committed a terrorist act, you can't get a lawyer, they could hold you without a trial, and people in this country better wake up because what they're doing to them guys at Guantanamo, down at Gitmo, they could do to you.
[01:43:09.872 --> 01:43:15.636]  Well that's what the belligerent act states that John McCain's introduced and Lindsey Graham's supporting.
[01:43:15.636 --> 01:43:17.397]  It says for any intelligence reason,
[01:43:18.121 --> 01:43:24.299]  Or any direction of the President, citizens can be grabbed and given enhanced interrogation and never be seen again.
[01:43:24.299 --> 01:43:25.081]  I'm not kidding.
[01:43:25.081 --> 01:43:25.924]  I even had Judge McCullough...
[01:43:30.825 --> 01:43:32.146]  Guys, print the Belligerent Act.
[01:43:32.146 --> 01:43:34.367]  I want to read Governor Ventura the actual passage.
[01:43:34.367 --> 01:43:37.529]  Yes, sir, and I had Judge Napolitano on, who's a former federal judge.
[01:43:37.529 --> 01:43:38.569]  Sure.
[01:43:38.569 --> 01:43:49.615]  And he pointed out, it says that the fact that you've been grabbed is a secret unless the House and Senate Intelligence Committee vote to allow it to be known you've even been grabbed.
[01:43:49.615 --> 01:43:51.176]  Really?
[01:43:51.176 --> 01:43:55.258]  Well, then let me say this on your show, Alex.
[01:43:55.258 --> 01:43:57.780]  I will never disappear by my own choice.
[01:44:00.638 --> 01:44:01.499]  Good point.
[01:44:01.499 --> 01:44:11.792]  So, I've said it now on your show, so everybody knows that if Jesse Finterrell suddenly disappears, they'll know that I wouldn't do that.
[01:44:11.792 --> 01:44:15.357]  Other than to go surfing in Mexico, and you know that I'll come back every spring.
[01:44:17.051 --> 01:44:19.073]  Well, I tell you, that brings me to the next question.
[01:44:19.073 --> 01:44:29.080]  I mean, as things heat up, as you become even more prominent, if that's possible, but you certainly are, and as people's respect for you goes even higher, we need to take good care of you.
[01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:34.284]  So watch out there aren't some frogmen out there when you're surfing that try to make you disappear.
[01:44:34.284 --> 01:44:38.607]  Be careful, I hope you're strapping a sidearm or at least a speargun when you're out there.
[01:44:38.607 --> 01:44:45.812]  Nah, you know, I've always been a pretty good swimmer, Alex, and I can take care of myself in the water.
[01:44:47.521 --> 01:44:52.385]  And I truly don't believe any of my SEAL team mates would do that to me.
[01:44:52.385 --> 01:44:53.606]  No, I don't think they wouldn't either.
[01:44:53.606 --> 01:44:56.408]  I don't believe that would happen.
[01:44:56.408 --> 01:45:01.552]  And so, maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think so.
[01:45:01.552 --> 01:45:06.136]  It's just a case, again, where we've got to keep talking.
[01:45:06.136 --> 01:45:13.381]  Like that lady that's run through that thing, I have sympathy for her son, who's over there fighting, because it's our fault.
[01:45:13.381 --> 01:45:14.962]  People need to understand this also.
[01:45:16.330 --> 01:45:19.183]  We can end all these wars by bringing the draft back.
[01:45:19.958 --> 01:45:22.760]  Well now we've got a mercenary army.
[01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:24.662]  I think we should ban that first.
[01:45:49.168 --> 01:45:50.390]  And I agree totally.
[01:45:50.390 --> 01:45:52.333]  You gotta get rid of these mercenaries.
[01:45:52.333 --> 01:45:54.377]  You gotta get rid of Blackweather.
[01:45:54.377 --> 01:46:00.566]  You gotta get rid of all of them groups, because there's actually more mercenaries in Iraq today than there are soldiers.
[01:46:01.115 --> 01:46:26.131]  Well, I've talked to Anthony Schaefer, Special Forces Colonel Commander, and he talked about how the CIA wouldn't let him kill Bin Laden two weeks before 9-11, and he said that was being done because they already had contractors in the CIA with more power than the Army and the Navy, and that they basically are above the law and can do whatever they want, so... In Crowdy's book, you'll find out the CIA runs our military.
[01:46:26.131 --> 01:46:30.474]  Our military is used to back up whatever the CIA is getting involved with.
[01:46:31.502 --> 01:46:35.483]  Well, that's what Colonel Schaefer says, yeah.
[01:46:35.483 --> 01:46:37.884]  Oh yeah, I'm proud he says it too.
[01:46:37.884 --> 01:46:41.105]  Well, he might be good to interview Anthony Schaefer.
[01:46:41.105 --> 01:46:43.586]  He's on Fox and MSNBC and CNN, all of them.
[01:46:43.586 --> 01:46:45.686]  Let me read this to you, just so it's on record.
[01:46:45.686 --> 01:46:49.407]  In fact, here's the bill right here racing through the Senate right now.
[01:46:49.407 --> 01:46:52.608]  The sinners to be detained as enemy belligerents.
[01:46:52.608 --> 01:46:54.429]  The full bill can be read here.
[01:46:54.429 --> 01:46:58.210]  A person is considered a high-value detainee if they fulfill one of the following criteria.
[01:46:58.917 --> 01:47:00.398]  Alex, torture you to do what?
[01:47:25.015 --> 01:47:26.917]  I guess to say you're guilty.
[01:47:26.917 --> 01:47:27.597]  Well, I don't know.
[01:47:27.597 --> 01:47:31.261]  Okay, let's say hypothetically they grabbed me.
[01:47:31.261 --> 01:47:36.205]  What would they torture me to find out?
[01:47:36.205 --> 01:47:36.986]  That's the whole point.
[01:47:36.986 --> 01:47:40.529]  They only torture for terror and to get false confessions.
[01:47:40.529 --> 01:47:43.511]  Okay, so I'd have to confess to something then, right?
[01:47:43.511 --> 01:47:44.292]  Yes.
[01:47:44.292 --> 01:47:45.153]  Okay.
[01:47:45.153 --> 01:47:46.434]  That's what I was interested in.
[01:47:46.434 --> 01:47:49.997]  Why on earth would they pick someone and then torture them?
[01:47:49.997 --> 01:47:50.758]  For what purpose?
[01:47:51.713 --> 01:47:56.616]  Well now, if we ever have another big war and people torture our troops, how can we say it's wrong?
[01:47:56.616 --> 01:47:58.297]  We can't.
[01:47:58.297 --> 01:48:02.740]  We haven't been able to do that since Abu Ghraib and Gitmo.
[01:48:02.740 --> 01:48:03.300]  We can't.
[01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:03.920]  We can't.
[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:07.883]  You know, let me throw this out for your listeners to understand this too, Alex.
[01:48:09.392 --> 01:48:19.344]  You know, we in the United States, and let me reiterate, my father's a World War II vet, my mother's a World War II vet, my brother and I are both Vietnam vets.
[01:48:19.344 --> 01:48:21.867]  I say that because of what I'm going to tell you now.
[01:48:21.867 --> 01:48:27.133]  We in the United States have been practicing terrorism for 50 years.
[01:48:27.133 --> 01:48:28.895]  We just call it foreign policy.
[01:48:29.341 --> 01:48:30.142]  Yes.
[01:48:30.142 --> 01:48:32.603]  Because we've been terrorizing Cuba.
[01:48:32.603 --> 01:48:36.466]  We've attempted to kill Castro on multiple occasions.
[01:48:36.466 --> 01:48:38.747]  We've ruined their cane fields.
[01:48:38.747 --> 01:48:41.449]  We've attempted to destroy their economy.
[01:48:41.449 --> 01:48:45.972]  Now, do you know about this character Orlando Bosch?
[01:48:45.972 --> 01:48:47.132]  Tell folks about it.
[01:48:47.132 --> 01:48:53.857]  Well, Orlando Bosch was a guy who blew up a civilian Cuban airliner.
[01:48:53.857 --> 01:48:55.938]  For the CIA and got protected.
[01:48:57.263 --> 01:48:59.345]  No, there were 73 people on board.
[01:48:59.345 --> 01:49:01.808]  Now, is that not an act of terrorism?
[01:49:01.808 --> 01:49:02.168]  It is!
[01:49:02.168 --> 01:49:03.889]  Well, Bruce Sr.
[01:49:03.889 --> 01:49:05.071]  pardoned him.
[01:49:05.071 --> 01:49:05.331]  Yes.
[01:49:05.331 --> 01:49:09.795]  This guy that blew up a plane with 73 people on it.
[01:49:12.862 --> 01:49:21.969]  In fact, we need to realize that we need to take our heads out of the sand, the citizens of the United States of America, and start realizing.
[01:49:21.969 --> 01:49:23.611]  Think of it this way.
[01:49:23.611 --> 01:49:28.615]  Why do we have to spend so much money on our defense budget?
[01:49:28.615 --> 01:49:32.158]  Who's after us, and for what reason?
[01:49:32.158 --> 01:49:34.760]  What are we protecting ourselves from?
[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:38.283]  Obviously, we haven't behaved very well throughout the world.
[01:49:39.156 --> 01:49:49.421]  Because clearly, if we're in such danger that literally half of our money and our taxes have to go to defense spending, what does that tell you?
[01:49:49.421 --> 01:49:59.145]  Well, I wanted to add that that individual you mentioned we cover in Terror Storm, it's declassified that he blew up a plane full of the Olympic team for the Cubans.
[01:49:59.145 --> 01:49:59.325]  Yeah.
[01:50:00.134 --> 01:50:15.479]  So, so, again, and then there really isn't many people attacking us, so the military industrial complex goes out and finances terror groups or stages attacks as the pretext to ratchet up the naked body scanners and the face scanners and the control.
[01:50:15.479 --> 01:50:18.760]  Yeah, maybe well, you may well be right on that.
[01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:23.861]  Because again, you know, we've been practicing terrorism for 50 years.
[01:50:23.861 --> 01:50:25.502]  We just call it foreign policy.
[01:50:26.713 --> 01:50:27.414]  You know?
[01:50:27.414 --> 01:50:32.158]  I mean, look at all the people we've tried to assassinate down in Central America.
[01:50:32.158 --> 01:50:34.760]  That's not terrorism?
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:40.185]  When you go in and attempt, just because a country has a different form of government than you have?
[01:50:40.185 --> 01:50:45.030]  What gives us the right to go into that country and attempt to assassinate their leader?
[01:50:46.030 --> 01:50:48.111]  Well, if they tried it here, they'd be called terrorists.
[01:50:48.111 --> 01:50:50.013]  I'm skipping this network break.
[01:50:50.013 --> 01:50:52.054]  We've got about nine minutes left with Jesse Ventura.
[01:50:52.054 --> 01:50:53.355]  This is a network break.
[01:50:53.355 --> 01:50:55.316]  We're skipping it, not station break.
[01:50:55.316 --> 01:50:58.318]  Just a word to everybody out there who's just joined us.
[01:50:58.318 --> 01:51:01.140]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:51:01.140 --> 01:51:07.845]  I want to encourage all the listeners to not procrastinate and get Jesse Ventura's American Conspiracies at Infowars.com.
[01:51:07.845 --> 01:51:11.367]  You can get the book, $5 off the book and hardcover, and then get
[01:51:12.555 --> 01:51:15.116]  The film of your choice, with the book, when you get it.
[01:51:31.084 --> 01:51:35.085]  Your television show, when is it going to be back on the airwaves?
[01:51:35.085 --> 01:51:40.666]  Can you give us any view into what some of the episodes may be about?
[01:51:40.666 --> 01:51:44.087]  Alex, right now we're just ramping up.
[01:51:44.087 --> 01:51:45.868]  They just got the budget approved.
[01:51:45.868 --> 01:51:49.589]  My son is finally, I think he'll get a paycheck next week.
[01:51:49.589 --> 01:51:51.429]  So that means it's actually happening.
[01:51:51.429 --> 01:51:53.370]  Because that's how you judge in LA.
[01:51:53.370 --> 01:51:58.231]  A project's happening when you get a check and it clears the bank.
[01:51:58.231 --> 01:51:58.431]  Yes.
[01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:08.348]  Well, he should be getting paid next week for his opening participation in the show.
[01:52:08.348 --> 01:52:09.469]  We'll be ramping up.
[01:52:09.469 --> 01:52:21.380]  We haven't pared down to what the ten conspiracies will be, but I will tell you they are allowing me to go back after JFK.
[01:52:24.429 --> 01:52:27.831]  So we will be taking one trip back to the past.
[01:52:27.831 --> 01:52:36.176]  And we're going to unleash some probably new things on the John F. Kennedy assassination that I don't believe anybody else.
[01:52:36.176 --> 01:52:46.883]  And if we're successful on one of the things we do, it will completely show that it was a conspiracy and that Oswald did not act alone.
[01:52:46.883 --> 01:52:47.583]  Amazing.
[01:52:47.583 --> 01:52:49.004]  And that's all I'll say for now.
[01:52:49.884 --> 01:52:51.585]  Because I don't dare go any farther.
[01:52:51.585 --> 01:52:52.186]  Exactly.
[01:52:52.186 --> 01:53:00.812]  And you know, and then, other things that are on the radar screen, are you familiar with this Plum Island?
[01:53:00.812 --> 01:53:01.093]  Yeah.
[01:53:13.662 --> 01:53:17.445]  Well, that's on the screen right now.
[01:53:17.445 --> 01:53:18.906]  And there's a few other good ones.
[01:53:18.906 --> 01:53:21.287]  And again, we're just paring them down now.
[01:53:21.287 --> 01:53:24.329]  We'll probably see what happens is this.
[01:53:24.329 --> 01:53:28.452]  ProTV will start off and they'll approve like two or three of them.
[01:53:28.452 --> 01:53:31.094]  So we'll go ahead and begin working on them.
[01:53:31.094 --> 01:53:36.017]  Then in the process of working on them, other approvals will come for the other shows.
[01:53:36.577 --> 01:53:36.937]  Yeah.
[01:53:36.937 --> 01:53:38.778]  Well you guys aren't half-assing this either.
[01:53:38.778 --> 01:53:42.719]  You do a lot of research, a lot of work, a lot goes into this television show.
[01:53:59.071 --> 01:54:08.736]  For our little purse string budget that we're on, we do a hell of a job because you know what I actually didn't in negotiations this year?
[01:54:08.736 --> 01:54:09.357]  Why?
[01:54:09.357 --> 01:54:16.721]  I was already locked in for the second season so I couldn't negotiate money at all, but I could negotiate artistically.
[01:54:16.721 --> 01:54:28.287]  I told my top agent at William Morris, I said, look, I want it in writing that this year we'll actually get a set of clappers for when we're out on the streets.
[01:54:29.486 --> 01:54:32.449]  You know what clappers are now, right?
[01:54:32.449 --> 01:54:43.581]  Well, they're those little boards you see in Hollywood, where they put it in front of the camera, what scene it is, blah blah blah, and then they clap, and that way you can separate all your shoots.
[01:54:43.581 --> 01:54:48.726]  Well, we were so cheap in doing this thing initially, we had to use our hands.
[01:54:51.089 --> 01:54:52.309]  We're good to go.
[01:55:13.354 --> 01:55:20.803]  Man, I tell you, you spent so much time, what, six months of work or more over a year making the last television program.
[01:55:20.803 --> 01:55:22.646]  So when will we see this air?
[01:55:22.646 --> 01:55:25.089]  In the fall of this year?
[01:55:25.089 --> 01:55:31.957]  I can't even venture a guess right now because, again, it'll depend on how many of them they want done and in the can.
[01:55:32.738 --> 01:55:45.260]  And how many, and at what point are we at to finish up whatever's left before they, because once they make the decision to start airing them, I've got a feeling they're going to want to have the majority of them done.
[01:55:45.260 --> 01:55:52.141]  So that they can air them weekly like they did last time, or ten weeks in a row you will get a different conspiracy every week.
[01:55:52.141 --> 01:56:01.503]  Well I look forward... So venturing, and again I'm just spitballing here, venturing a guess I would say the soonest we'll be on will be sometime in the fall.
[01:56:02.225 --> 01:56:04.006]  Well, I look forward to seeing you again in person.
[01:56:04.006 --> 01:56:04.707]  You're so great.
[01:56:04.707 --> 01:56:06.528]  So is your son and the whole crew.
[01:56:06.528 --> 01:56:15.476]  The book is American Conspiracies available at InfoWars.com and everywhere else, but we have it discounted with a free film at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:56:15.476 --> 01:56:17.998]  Governor Ventura, in closing, we got about three minutes left here.
[01:56:22.722 --> 01:56:24.143]  Well, I still don't know exactly who is.
[01:56:24.143 --> 01:56:26.145]  You know, if you're asking me to name names, I can't do that.
[01:56:26.145 --> 01:56:27.486]  Even Fletcher Crowdy can't do it.
[01:56:46.786 --> 01:56:50.577]  To me, the agenda is simple and it seems clear to me.
[01:56:50.577 --> 01:56:54.267]  Ever since 9-11, it's been an agenda to take away our freedoms.
[01:56:55.929 --> 01:56:57.631]  You can leave it right at that.
[01:56:57.631 --> 01:57:11.282]  Because the most dangerous thing I've seen that have come out of all of this crap in the last ten years is the fact that they've suspended habeas corpus, they've literally shredded the Fourth Amendment of illegal search and seizure.
[01:57:11.282 --> 01:57:21.230]  Every person in America needs to understand that every phone call you make and every email you send, the government has the capability to be eavesdropping that.
[01:57:21.890 --> 01:57:23.851]  Now, are they doing it to all of them?
[01:57:23.851 --> 01:57:25.052]  Of course not.
[01:57:25.052 --> 01:57:35.759]  But they have the ability, and they have the assurance that they can do it, because apparently our Constitution... You know what's kind of interesting, Alex, is this.
[01:57:35.759 --> 01:57:38.701]  I now understand why they eradicate marijuana.
[01:57:38.701 --> 01:57:41.783]  Do you know why I can understand that?
[01:57:41.783 --> 01:57:42.524]  Why?
[01:57:42.524 --> 01:57:49.869]  Because our Constitution, Bill of Rights, and the flag are all made of marijuana.
[01:57:49.869 --> 01:57:50.389]  That's true!
[01:57:52.231 --> 01:57:53.973]  All the originals are him!
[01:57:53.973 --> 01:57:56.414]  They're all made out of marijuana.
[01:57:56.414 --> 01:58:01.698]  The Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Betsy Ross's flag.
[01:58:01.698 --> 01:58:12.587]  And so it doesn't surprise me that they want to eradicate marijuana because they're eradicating our Constitution, they're eradicating our Bill of Rights, and they've certainly eradicated the flag in my opinion.
[01:58:13.303 --> 01:58:18.585]  Governor, I'm going to say bye to you as soon as the show ends here in about 30 seconds, but I really want to thank you for coming on.
[01:58:18.585 --> 01:58:33.050]  Congratulations for doing it your way, telling the truth, not compromising, getting a number one hit TV show on your network, number four on the New York Times bestseller list for the book, and people are waking up and we got a good chance of bringing down this new world order, and thank God we got you on our team.
[01:58:33.050 --> 01:58:34.411]  God bless you, Governor.
[01:58:34.411 --> 01:58:35.631]  Alright, thanks Alex.
[01:58:35.631 --> 01:58:38.312]  We'll talk to you again in the spring.
[01:58:38.312 --> 01:58:39.093]  Absolutely.
[01:58:39.093 --> 01:58:40.173]  God bless you, Jesse Ventura.
[01:58:42.338 --> 01:58:45.587]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:00:02.339 --> 02:00:04.840]  It's already the final hour.
[02:00:04.840 --> 02:00:09.563]  Thank you so much for joining us for this live Monday edition.
[02:00:09.563 --> 02:00:20.991]  Katherine Austin Fitz to talk about the economy, the police state, the New World Order, the nature of the elites, is coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:23.058 --> 02:00:24.782]  Let's go ahead and take some more calls.
[02:00:24.782 --> 02:00:27.289]  Tony and Canada, you're on the air.
[02:00:27.289 --> 02:00:28.832]  Jason!
[02:00:28.832 --> 02:00:29.654]  Hello?
[02:00:29.654 --> 02:00:30.717]  Yes, sir.
[02:00:30.717 --> 02:00:31.659]  Hey, how you doing, boss?
[02:00:31.659 --> 02:00:32.602]  Alright.
[02:00:33.636 --> 02:00:34.977]  Uh, perfect.
[02:00:34.977 --> 02:00:40.759]  Um, I just, I was doing a lot of research over the past year because of all the information you guys have been providing.
[02:00:40.759 --> 02:00:42.860]  Of course, everybody's thankful for that.
[02:00:42.860 --> 02:00:43.740]  We do appreciate it.
[02:00:43.740 --> 02:00:53.324]  Uh, but I haven't been hearing a lot of information about, uh, security companies like Converse Technology and Verint and Nice Systems.
[02:00:54.091 --> 02:00:55.372]  As well as noise.
[02:00:55.372 --> 02:01:06.578]  Well they're a revolving door in Homeland Security and it's the same in Europe where when somebody's in Homeland Security they give them the contracts and then five years later they move into that company as an executive.
[02:01:07.228 --> 02:01:08.268]  Well, absolutely.
[02:01:08.268 --> 02:01:19.892]  And one of the biggest issues is that Congress, the headquarters is in Israel as well as all these other sub-companies or umbrella companies like Rent and Norris and all these other companies.
[02:01:19.892 --> 02:01:25.233]  But they have contracts now with American telecom communication companies.
[02:01:25.233 --> 02:01:33.256]  And now each and every single telephone across North America is linked to Israeli intelligence through this system because it's always... I mean, that's been for 10 years.
[02:01:34.562 --> 02:01:36.724]  That's been for 10 years, absolutely.
[02:01:36.724 --> 02:01:38.325]  Because then they can get around U.S.
[02:01:38.325 --> 02:01:44.231]  laws because a foreign government is doing the spying and then giving it back to the NSA.
[02:01:44.231 --> 02:01:47.994]  They claim it doesn't get around the law, it just hides the criminality.
[02:01:48.849 --> 02:01:50.290]  No, exactly, exactly.
[02:01:50.290 --> 02:02:09.560]  And if you do this to try not to leak, probably back down to a source file, which the major clients are American Defense Department, the National Security Department, and a lot of these people think that when they go online and they think that they're safe through these security companies, but one of the major companies that I found that was connected to these things is VeriSign.
[02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:16.944]  Now, VeriSign deals with most of the, majority of the credit card securities online, and everybody trusts this company, but VeriSign
[02:02:17.484 --> 02:02:23.446]  And the government can raise up the tech companies they want to be preeminent by giving them the contracts.
[02:02:23.446 --> 02:02:24.587]  Great point, Tony.
[02:02:24.587 --> 02:02:27.407]  Mohammed in Colorado, you're on the air.
[02:02:42.506 --> 02:02:50.692]  Hey, so I don't know if anybody mentioned this on the Friday or Sunday show, but I just went to go see the new Clash of the Titans movie yesterday.
[02:02:51.480 --> 02:03:04.269]  And unlike the 80s show that's all about some dude that's left-struck and going to fight things, this one, to me, was really almost like an allegory for the current state of the U.S.
[02:03:04.269 --> 02:03:14.817]  So, in the movie, you've got these titans that are defeated by their sons, the gods, and the gods make people, human beings, to pray to them in order for them to live forever.
[02:03:15.606 --> 02:03:16.907]  Yeah, Ben Laden is the Kraken!
[02:03:16.907 --> 02:03:17.368]  Release the Kraken!
[02:03:39.252 --> 02:03:48.160]  You got people who fled from England, the tyranny in England, you know, and so these are represented by the gods.
[02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:52.724]  And so the gods set up a government for the people.
[02:03:52.724 --> 02:03:55.406]  And you're supposed to pay your taxes to the government.
[02:03:55.406 --> 02:03:58.389]  And right now, in the current state, the government's becoming tyrannical.
[02:03:59.327 --> 02:04:04.070]  And so people are just kind of kicking the fan, saying, no, no, we're not, we're not going to really put up with this tyranny.
[02:04:04.070 --> 02:04:07.392]  And so the government's like, release the Kraken, you know, I'm for the people.
[02:04:07.392 --> 02:04:12.395]  And so halfway through the movie, I really just started to realize, you know, this is really almost about America.
[02:04:12.395 --> 02:04:21.881]  Well, George Lucas said that episode three, Revenge of the Sith, is where the senator becomes the president, then the ruler, by staging terror attacks
[02:04:22.261 --> 02:04:23.081]  Yeah, so I sent you out there.
[02:04:23.081 --> 02:04:25.862]  Anybody that wants to, you know, take a moment and remove yourself from some stress?
[02:04:44.640 --> 02:04:47.302]  Overall, it's a pretty good movie.
[02:04:47.302 --> 02:04:51.364]  And that message to Al Gore is very overt, so it didn't take out a lot of digging until we realized that.
[02:04:51.364 --> 02:04:52.364]  So, it's worth checking out.
[02:04:52.364 --> 02:04:53.825]  It's a shame.
[02:04:53.825 --> 02:04:57.928]  Well, I don't watch a lot of films, but I may have to go watch it so we can do a review here.
[02:04:57.928 --> 02:05:00.049]  Plus, I like escapism occasionally.
[02:05:01.155 --> 02:05:04.179]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:05:04.179 --> 02:05:09.505]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:05:09.505 --> 02:05:11.548]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:05:11.548 --> 02:05:16.554]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:05:16.554 --> 02:05:17.736]  How much do you want?
[02:05:17.736 --> 02:05:18.477]  When do you want it?
[02:05:18.857 --> 02:05:20.737]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:05:20.737 --> 02:05:21.818]  When will you need it?
[02:05:21.818 --> 02:05:24.018]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:05:24.018 --> 02:05:25.359]  Will there be any food?
[02:05:25.359 --> 02:05:26.879]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:05:26.879 --> 02:05:32.140]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:05:32.140 --> 02:05:35.721]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:05:35.721 --> 02:05:39.182]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:05:39.542 --> 02:05:40.763]  How much will you need?
[02:05:40.763 --> 02:05:41.684]  We don't know.
[02:05:41.684 --> 02:05:42.784]  How much do you want?
[02:05:42.784 --> 02:05:43.705]  All you can get.
[02:05:43.705 --> 02:05:44.806]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:05:44.806 --> 02:05:47.848]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:05:47.848 --> 02:05:49.630]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:05:49.630 --> 02:05:50.550]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:06:02.062 --> 02:06:06.023]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:06.023 --> 02:06:14.885]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:06:14.885 --> 02:06:19.506]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:06:19.506 --> 02:06:30.328]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:06:30.948 --> 02:06:40.470]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:40.470 --> 02:06:45.892]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:06:45.892 --> 02:06:53.393]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:53.393 --> 02:06:56.134]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:06:59.909 --> 02:07:04.452]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:04.452 --> 02:07:05.373]  Number 1.
[02:07:05.373 --> 02:07:08.796]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:08.796 --> 02:07:09.656]  Number 2.
[02:07:09.656 --> 02:07:14.560]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:15.300]  It's true.
[02:07:15.300 --> 02:07:20.164]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:20.164 --> 02:07:21.005]  Number 3.
[02:07:21.005 --> 02:07:24.587]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:24.587 --> 02:07:28.290]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:28.470 --> 02:07:29.270]  Number 4.
[02:07:29.270 --> 02:07:32.031]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:32.031 --> 02:07:35.712]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:35.712 --> 02:07:36.512]  Number 5.
[02:07:36.512 --> 02:07:40.653]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:40.653 --> 02:07:45.695]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:45.695 --> 02:07:49.876]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:49.876 --> 02:07:51.657]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:51.657 --> 02:07:56.258]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[02:07:56.758 --> 02:08:07.409]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:07.409 --> 02:08:09.531]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:21.391 --> 02:08:24.992]  Well, for the balance of the hour, Kathryn Austin-Fitz is our guest.
[02:08:24.992 --> 02:08:30.173]  We're going to cover a whole host of different issues with her today.
[02:08:30.173 --> 02:08:40.415]  She's with Solari.com, Investment Advisor, Founder and Managing Member of Solari Investment Advisory Services, LLC.
[02:08:40.415 --> 02:08:43.896]  It's spelled S-O-L-A-R-I.com.
[02:08:43.896 --> 02:08:47.837]  Kathryn has designed and closed over $25 billion of transactions and investments
[02:08:48.756 --> 02:08:54.019]  To date, and has led portfolio strategy for $300 billion of financial assets and liabilities.
[02:08:54.019 --> 02:08:58.441]  We recently interviewed her for her upcoming film, Fall of the Republic 2.
[02:08:58.441 --> 02:09:00.743]  Catherine's experiences on Wall Street in Washington, D.C.
[02:09:00.743 --> 02:09:06.266]  are chronicled in Dylan Reed and the Aristocracy of Stock Portfolios.
[02:09:06.266 --> 02:09:17.872]  She's also a former government official, Assistant Secretary of Housing, Federal Housing Commissioner under Bush 1, Investment Banker, Managing Director and member of the board of Wall Street firm Dylan Reed & Co, Inc.
[02:09:18.670 --> 02:09:20.932]  And so it doesn't get any more leaked than that.
[02:09:20.932 --> 02:09:24.634]  And she joins us for the next 51 minutes here today.
[02:09:24.634 --> 02:09:32.040]  Catherine, out of the gates, we're going to get into government health care and your take on what it does.
[02:09:32.040 --> 02:09:35.102]  But I first wanted to go to this Businessweek article.
[02:09:35.102 --> 02:09:38.845]  FDIC wants pension funds to prop up failed banks.
[02:09:38.845 --> 02:09:40.766]  And in fact, this isn't the Bloomberg.
[02:09:40.766 --> 02:09:41.227]  This is the
[02:09:44.088 --> 02:09:46.009]  Well, we have seen the pension funds over the last 10 to 20 years.
[02:10:09.974 --> 02:10:18.277]  We've come under significant pressure to invest in a variety of things which have left the pension funds in real trouble.
[02:10:18.277 --> 02:10:19.957]  So we have the pension funds.
[02:10:19.957 --> 02:10:29.421]  The pension funds, the American pension funds, were the key vehicle used to finance the housing bubble and have gotten, you know, left holding the bag.
[02:10:29.421 --> 02:10:37.824]  And so it is incredibly important, Alex, that pension funds have the legal protection and authority to finance
[02:10:38.644 --> 02:10:40.925]  You know, what is the right thing to do?
[02:10:40.925 --> 02:10:53.369]  And if there's one reform that needs to happen, it's a real investigation of why do the pension funds keep doing, you know, the scams, and how do you stop that?
[02:10:53.369 --> 02:11:00.972]  Because it's left, you know, we now have state and local governments and companies having to come up with new big pension fund payments because
[02:11:01.653 --> 02:11:04.495]  There's been too much political interference.
[02:11:04.495 --> 02:11:16.563]  I described, you've heard me tell the story where the president of the largest pension fund in the country, CalPERS, said to me in 1997 when I was trying to interest him in refinancing American communities, he said, it's too late.
[02:11:16.563 --> 02:11:17.263]  You don't understand.
[02:11:17.263 --> 02:11:18.304]  They've given up on the country.
[02:11:18.304 --> 02:11:21.326]  They're moving all the money out starting in the fall.
[02:11:21.326 --> 02:11:28.671]  You know, and he, and my question is, you know, well, who's they and how can they order you as a pension fund board to just
[02:11:29.639 --> 02:11:45.039]  You know, do things with your money and the reality is, if CalPERS had invested in the fundamental infrastructure and well-being of American communities and American infrastructure, they would have lost a lot less money.
[02:11:45.885 --> 02:11:48.406]  You know, instead of losing it on the pump and dump.
[02:11:48.406 --> 02:11:53.407]  And we would have an infrastructure and a nation, but this is predatory.
[02:11:53.407 --> 02:11:58.628]  And again, you were there at the top of the pyramid watching this happen, trying to stop it on record.
[02:11:58.628 --> 02:12:00.329]  Right.
[02:12:00.329 --> 02:12:15.153]  Even at the time, so to be clear, we have the head NASA climatologist, we have the UN, we have all these world leaders, Bill Gates saying they want to destroy industrial society, so they get you in debt, get your local governments, pension funds, police, fire, you name it.
[02:12:16.298 --> 02:12:24.204]  They move it all offshore, then the country implodes, and then they come in with even more debt, then they take over healthcare, then they run your life.
[02:12:24.204 --> 02:12:24.584]  Go ahead.
[02:12:24.584 --> 02:12:27.126]  Right, so then they say your pension funds have lost all this money.
[02:12:27.126 --> 02:12:29.727]  Now, what's the TFDIC up to?
[02:12:29.727 --> 02:12:33.310]  The last person who should be telling the pension funds what they should invest in
[02:12:33.931 --> 02:12:34.952]  is the FDIC.
[02:12:34.952 --> 02:12:47.683]  Now I say that, and Alex, what you need to know is, you know, the patterns appear that lots of small banks are being targeted in a way that's ending up providing subsidy to the people who pick them up.
[02:12:47.683 --> 02:12:59.513]  In other words, we have a double standard in enforcement by the banking regulators, so the big banks who've been doing all the improper things get bailed out, and the small banks who've been well-managed
[02:13:00.020 --> 02:13:04.804]  are getting targeted and taken over in a way that subsidizes the big banks.
[02:13:04.804 --> 02:13:15.171]  So, you have to be careful behind here, you know, that we don't see the FDIC driving the small banks into pension funds in a way that is part of an economic warfare game.
[02:13:15.171 --> 02:13:25.659]  And my fear is, you know, the next thing you know, you see state and local government pension funds financing someone like Soros, or the big hedge fund operators picking up these small banks for cheap.
[02:13:26.909 --> 02:13:27.550]  Absolutely.
[02:13:27.550 --> 02:13:30.433]  So that's why I brought this article up first.
[02:13:30.433 --> 02:13:48.130]  And I want you to spend some more time on this before we get into some other related issues, because here they are in Businessweek in Bloomberg saying, and Obama's people are now out there pushing this, that, oh, we're going to just take your pension funds wholesale to protect them
[02:13:48.795 --> 02:13:55.825]  And then of course they'll invest those in derivatives again, then they'll take a large portion of it down the road, get people more dependent on government.
[02:13:55.825 --> 02:14:01.173]  Well, we did take most of it, but, you know, you gotta stick with us or you won't get any of it.
[02:14:01.173 --> 02:14:01.593]  It's this.
[02:14:02.829 --> 02:14:04.491]  Here's the question.
[02:14:04.491 --> 02:14:12.099]  Should capital be allocated according to, one, the preferences of the people who are either responsible, own it, or control it?
[02:14:12.099 --> 02:14:17.224]  Two, according to economic performance, i.e., you know, what's the best investment?
[02:14:17.224 --> 02:14:25.833]  Or three, should it be channeled according to government dictates to a few small investors that allow them to control and own everything?
[02:14:27.546 --> 02:14:28.927]  Well, let me stop you again.
[02:14:28.927 --> 02:14:29.487]  Exactly.
[02:14:29.487 --> 02:14:37.750]  It sounds good that in the banking bill, the government is now officially in the banking business.
[02:14:37.750 --> 02:14:50.316]  Slipped into it was a student loan legislation where the government will now be the person loaning, but really it'll be the government directing you to specific top three or four banks.
[02:14:50.316 --> 02:14:55.078]  So this is a vertical integration, and I want to be clear here for new listeners.
[02:14:55.078 --> 02:14:55.798]  The government
[02:14:56.451 --> 02:14:57.412]  It's the Soviet Union.
[02:15:26.115 --> 02:15:27.256]  Here's what you've got.
[02:15:27.256 --> 02:15:30.757]  Let's say your neighbor, Alex, is an insider.
[02:15:30.757 --> 02:15:33.778]  And you are an outsider.
[02:15:33.778 --> 02:15:37.720]  And your insider neighborhood plays ball with the government.
[02:15:37.720 --> 02:15:39.821]  And the government says, you know something?
[02:15:39.821 --> 02:15:45.263]  You can finance your car for zero percent, which is what hedge fund operators have been doing on the carry trade.
[02:15:45.263 --> 02:15:47.104]  They've been borrowing for zero to one percent.
[02:15:48.268 --> 02:16:01.413]  And your neighbor can finance his car with 0% financing, he can finance his mortgage with 0% financing, and we're going to provide equity financing to his business for 2%.
[02:16:01.413 --> 02:16:13.817]  Meantime, you have to pay 5% for your car financing, 6% for your mortgage financing, and by the way, you can't get equity for your business, but you can borrow at the bank for 12% if you can get somebody to guarantee you.
[02:16:13.817 --> 02:16:16.998]  Okay, now, how long is it going to take before your neighbor has
[02:16:17.782 --> 02:16:24.644]  You know, a much bigger car, a much bigger house, and has bought your business, you know, that went bankrupt.
[02:16:24.644 --> 02:16:31.447]  And you... And we're talking about controlling it through the back door, by controlling the cost of capital.
[02:16:31.447 --> 02:16:37.309]  And certain players get a very low, or even free, or negative cost of capital.
[02:16:37.309 --> 02:16:40.330]  So I'm a bank every time I lose... I'm a big bank every time I lose money.
[02:16:40.330 --> 02:16:42.930]  You just replenish what I lost.
[02:16:42.930 --> 02:16:47.152]  Whereas the rest of us have real risk, and we have to pay
[02:16:48.081 --> 02:16:54.666]  A much higher cost of capital than we would if we could just, you know, if there was a real market.
[02:16:54.666 --> 02:17:07.496]  And if you won't sell your business to them, they put in the green economy, which is run by government, they will selectively force you to sell your business or they will shut you down.
[02:17:07.496 --> 02:17:13.500]  Well, there's thousands of ways it happens, but there's a double standard in terms of regulatory enforcement.
[02:17:13.500 --> 02:17:17.303]  So, for example, you know, I used to have a broker dealer that was a small company.
[02:17:17.961 --> 02:17:27.889]  And before I'd worked on Wall Street, and if you look at the enforcement costs and time that we spent as a small business, it was significantly greater.
[02:17:27.889 --> 02:17:31.131]  You know, but there are double standards.
[02:17:31.131 --> 02:17:38.657]  Now, let me describe behind this what one of the legitimate problems is.
[02:17:38.657 --> 02:17:40.218]  We have a real problem
[02:17:41.022 --> 02:17:45.363]  In that right now, the financial markets have two goals.
[02:17:45.363 --> 02:17:52.165]  You know, the goal you're taught in business school is the goal of the financial markets is to allocate capital to the most efficient players.
[02:17:52.165 --> 02:18:03.348]  And so, you know, some companies are efficient and they make money and so they attract you, you buy their stock as opposed to the big bank that has the derivative method goes bankrupt, right?
[02:18:04.248 --> 02:18:06.249]  So one is the allocation of capital.
[02:18:06.249 --> 02:18:10.610]  The other increasingly, Alex, is geopolitical economic warfare.
[02:18:10.610 --> 02:18:19.173]  You know, we've gone from a planet where wars occur with bombs to where wars occur with derivative bombs.
[02:18:19.173 --> 02:18:20.534]  And you're literally seeing a
[02:18:21.872 --> 02:18:31.080]  It's sort of a geopolitical competition between the Chinese, the Russians, and populations around the globe for resources through the capital markets.
[02:18:31.080 --> 02:18:45.933]  And so the national security goals of manipulating the futures market or the price of oil or the price of gold have literally overtaken, you know, the goal of using the markets for whatever.
[02:18:45.933 --> 02:18:48.636]  And part of what you're seeing with all the goal of the capital control
[02:18:50.148 --> 02:18:55.451]  Is literally, if you're the government, you can't afford for people to be making a free market.
[02:18:55.451 --> 02:19:01.935]  You need every, you know, you need the 20 mules to go in this direction, because that's what you need to, like, manage the Chinese.
[02:19:01.935 --> 02:19:07.678]  And so you have this incredible desire for control, including for a legitimate reason.
[02:19:07.678 --> 02:19:09.119]  And let me tell you what the problem is.
[02:19:09.119 --> 02:19:11.560]  You and I have talked many times about the red button problem.
[02:19:12.307 --> 02:19:21.156]  Which is, everybody in America, right now, we are all the beneficiary of this geopolitical effort.
[02:19:21.156 --> 02:19:33.449]  So tomorrow, if the geopolitics and America stop playing to win at geopolitics, and we stop being the global leader in money laundering, and we stop, you know, stealing from people using derivatives,
[02:19:34.284 --> 02:19:41.330]  What would happen is everybody's government subsidy check would stop, and as of last month, Americans get more government checks.
[02:19:41.330 --> 02:19:44.413]  We get more money from the government than we send to the government taxes.
[02:19:44.413 --> 02:19:46.315]  Yeah, I saw that in the New York Times.
[02:19:46.315 --> 02:19:47.496]  Stay there.
[02:19:47.496 --> 02:19:56.424]  And again, I've been interrupting a few times because it's so incredible to see them openly saying they're going to take over the pension funds.
[02:19:56.424 --> 02:20:00.107]  We're going to break down where this is going when we come back.
[02:20:00.107 --> 02:20:00.528]  Stay with us.
[02:20:02.782 --> 02:20:04.783]  Remain in your houses.
[02:20:04.783 --> 02:20:10.546]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[02:20:10.546 --> 02:20:11.906]  Will they do it?
[02:20:11.906 --> 02:20:14.527]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[02:20:14.527 --> 02:20:20.990]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[02:20:20.990 --> 02:20:23.191]  Think it can't happen here?
[02:20:23.191 --> 02:20:25.212]  Executive Order 10990 locks down all highways.
[02:20:27.453 --> 02:20:32.339]  Executive Order 10995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[02:20:32.339 --> 02:20:37.245]  Executive Order 10998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[02:20:37.245 --> 02:20:42.071]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[02:20:42.992 --> 02:20:51.418]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[02:20:51.418 --> 02:20:53.920]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.
[02:20:53.920 --> 02:20:56.983]  Go to MartialLawSurvival.com right now.
[02:20:56.983 --> 02:20:59.905]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[02:21:00.993 --> 02:21:11.041]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[02:21:11.041 --> 02:21:17.466]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[02:21:17.466 --> 02:21:26.313]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[02:21:26.693 --> 02:21:35.881]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[02:21:35.881 --> 02:21:40.485]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[02:21:40.485 --> 02:21:42.287]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:42.287 --> 02:21:44.789]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[02:21:45.069 --> 02:21:48.392]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[02:21:48.392 --> 02:21:52.576]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[02:21:52.576 --> 02:21:53.317]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[02:21:53.317 --> 02:21:53.657]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:00.970 --> 02:22:05.933]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:22:05.933 --> 02:22:06.934]  What have we got?
[02:22:06.934 --> 02:22:09.355]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:22:09.355 --> 02:22:10.396]  A republic.
[02:22:10.396 --> 02:22:13.037]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:22:13.037 --> 02:22:15.299]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:22:15.299 --> 02:22:17.320]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:22:17.320 --> 02:22:19.001]  So they think they own our land?
[02:22:19.001 --> 02:22:20.322]  They think they own our water?
[02:22:20.322 --> 02:22:20.942]  Children?
[02:22:20.942 --> 02:22:22.063]  Our education?
[02:22:22.063 --> 02:22:22.884]  Our money?
[02:22:22.884 --> 02:22:26.546]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:22:26.906 --> 02:22:30.592]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:22:30.592 --> 02:22:31.874]  You have been warned.
[02:22:31.874 --> 02:22:32.896]  We have the facts.
[02:22:32.896 --> 02:22:34.057]  We have the Constitution.
[02:22:34.057 --> 02:22:34.979]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:22:34.979 --> 02:22:35.860]  We have common law.
[02:22:35.860 --> 02:22:38.384]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:38.384 --> 02:22:42.150]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:22:42.250 --> 02:22:47.214]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:22:47.214 --> 02:22:48.715]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:22:48.715 --> 02:22:49.795]  Don't tread on me.
[02:22:49.795 --> 02:22:56.220]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:23:01.232 --> 02:23:06.435]  How well and how fast does heart and body extract work to improve blood circulation?
[02:23:06.435 --> 02:23:07.136]  Listen.
[02:23:07.136 --> 02:23:11.399]  My name is Ellis and I'm 66 years old and I live in Jacksonville, Florida.
[02:23:11.399 --> 02:23:14.801]  Two years ago, I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries.
[02:23:14.801 --> 02:23:17.843]  I had 70% blockage in one artery leading to my heart.
[02:23:17.843 --> 02:23:21.225]  They wanted me to go on Plavix, but I refused knowing the negative side effects.
[02:23:21.621 --> 02:23:30.025]  Heart and body extract is a unique balance, synergy, and proportion of herbs reaching from head to toe at maximum absorption around 95% at the cellular level.
[02:23:30.025 --> 02:23:32.586]  Within the first month, I felt a dramatic difference.
[02:23:32.586 --> 02:23:36.948]  The heaviness in my legs was reduced, and within two months, I felt completely normal.
[02:23:37.188 --> 02:23:41.391]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is Heart and Body Extract.
[02:23:41.391 --> 02:23:45.593]  Heart and Body Extract comes with a 100% ironclad money-back guarantee.

[02:24:04.810 --> 02:24:08.073]  I want you to listen very carefully to Catherine Austin Fitts.
[02:24:08.073 --> 02:24:13.598]  I want her to go back over the information she just laid on us and expand on it.
[02:24:13.598 --> 02:24:15.059]  They get you dependent on government.
[02:24:15.059 --> 02:24:19.183]  They take your pension funds, your investment, your tax money for the infrastructure.
[02:24:19.183 --> 02:24:21.145]  They put it in offshore banks and derivatives.
[02:24:21.747 --> 02:24:28.050]  That bankrupts people by design, then they come back and say we need even more money and more taxes to prop all this up.
[02:24:28.050 --> 02:24:31.372]  When you hear it's for the geopolitical purposes of the U.S.
[02:24:31.372 --> 02:24:34.433]  and England and Europe, that's the private banking arms.
[02:24:34.433 --> 02:24:41.256]  They're feeding on us, but they get us tied into their system where we can't live with it or without it.
[02:24:41.256 --> 02:24:43.677]  And now it's coming towards a consolidation phase.
[02:24:43.677 --> 02:24:49.120]  They're going to use phony environmentalism to bring in a form of neo-serfdom or feudalism
[02:24:49.895 --> 02:24:50.956]  Oh, now Alex, you got me.
[02:25:12.036 --> 02:25:22.041]  I just finished making the point about the red button, and the extent to which we are financially dependent on global warfare.
[02:25:22.041 --> 02:25:32.025]  So we're implementing warfare globally, whether with military warfare, with covert operations warfare, or increasingly now with financial warfare.
[02:25:32.025 --> 02:25:37.788]  And the reality as a system is most Americans are the financial beneficiary of this sort
[02:25:38.488 --> 02:25:38.928]  We're good to go.
[02:25:54.748 --> 02:25:55.389]  We're good to go.
[02:26:10.183 --> 02:26:19.109]  In this warfare model, and so the question for all of us is, you know, nobody wants the top guys to push the red button because they're afraid.
[02:26:19.109 --> 02:26:26.454]  And as long as we're afraid to push the red button or to engage in a conversation about, you know, okay, how do we turn it green?
[02:26:26.454 --> 02:26:28.735]  How do we make it financially attractive?
[02:26:28.735 --> 02:26:30.697]  Then what happens as we go along?
[02:26:31.684 --> 02:26:38.127]  I can say it's they, you know, that they are doing this, but the reality is, Alex, that we are supporting them.
[02:26:38.127 --> 02:26:45.790]  If you look at the implementation of all of the sort of police state things, those things are being supported at the local level.
[02:26:45.790 --> 02:26:55.333]  I mean, I've watched all these things get implemented time after time after time, and it's, you know, there's always a group of local people who are helping promote it.
[02:26:55.333 --> 02:26:56.254]  It's frightening.
[02:26:56.254 --> 02:26:58.995]  And so, you know, but they're doing it because it makes the money.
[02:27:01.832 --> 02:27:05.693]  But to boil it down, we're coming to the end.
[02:27:05.693 --> 02:27:29.661]  The banks know they've pumped up the Ponzi scheme to such a level that they're now preparing to rob whatever wealth we've got left and you talked about how the elites for the last decade have been leaving the United States and now... They're not coming to the end because if you look at the wealth that this planet can create and harvest, the amount of wealth that's been created and can be harvested
[02:27:30.127 --> 02:27:33.003]  To date, it's tiny compared to what you could do in the next 20 or 30 years.
[02:27:34.621 --> 02:27:43.289]  So they've just, you know, this is far, we're on a journey and the wealth that can be created is far more than exists to date or have.
[02:27:43.289 --> 02:27:44.630]  Well, Catherine, you're misunderstanding.
[02:27:44.630 --> 02:27:44.990]  Hold on.
[02:27:44.990 --> 02:27:46.211]  You misunderstand what I'm saying.
[02:27:46.211 --> 02:27:46.612]  Okay.
[02:27:46.612 --> 02:28:00.263]  They are artificially cutting the avenues of wealth off to independent groups and smaller organizations and vertically integrating it and saying they want to cut wealth generation off to people in the West.
[02:28:00.263 --> 02:28:01.924]  I know they got us addicted.
[02:28:01.924 --> 02:28:02.125]  Right.
[02:28:03.025 --> 02:28:14.730]  Their attitude is, listen, if you all just sit down, shut up, you know, we put an implant on you and you live on $600 of government subsidy a month, it'll make it much easier for us to manage the planet.
[02:28:14.730 --> 02:28:17.731]  You've created a huge amount of wealth, we just stole it all.
[02:28:17.731 --> 02:28:24.914]  You're gonna be real unhappy about that, so we just want you to sit in the corner and shut up, because, you know, we're on to the next thing.
[02:28:24.914 --> 02:28:26.515]  Bye.
[02:28:26.515 --> 02:28:27.856]  And what is the next thing?
[02:28:27.856 --> 02:28:28.716]  What is the next thing?
[02:28:29.315 --> 02:28:32.997]  Well, the next thing is they go to a global economy and a global government.
[02:28:32.997 --> 02:28:39.060]  In other words, the people managing this in the United States don't see themselves as Americans anymore.
[02:28:39.060 --> 02:28:41.781]  They see themselves as globalists.
[02:28:41.781 --> 02:28:50.125]  And they're managing to a global operation, and in fact, if you look at where their big investments are, their big investments are in space.
[02:28:50.125 --> 02:28:55.688]  So in fact, you know, they're not necessarily even looking at planet Earth as the 100% base of operation.
[02:28:59.164 --> 02:29:11.461]  But they have fantastic new technology, and they have a global framework, and their attitude is, we've moved on, you're left behind, and the question is how to manage the endgame.
[02:29:13.015 --> 02:29:13.676]  I agree.
[02:29:13.676 --> 02:29:19.019]  Now when we come back with Katherine Austin-Fitz, I want you to elaborate on what their endgame is.
[02:29:19.019 --> 02:29:22.822]  And we were talking during the last break, you were saying there are ways to stop this.
[02:29:22.822 --> 02:29:25.383]  We want to get your perspective on that.
[02:29:25.383 --> 02:29:29.146]  Katherine Austin-Fitz is our guest.
[02:29:29.146 --> 02:29:32.968]  We really appreciate her being on the radio broadcast with us today.
[02:29:32.968 --> 02:29:37.732]  We'll give you her website as well when we come back after this quick break.
[02:29:37.732 --> 02:29:40.614]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:41.661 --> 02:29:43.782]  We're talking about reality here.
[02:29:43.782 --> 02:29:51.226]  Not the baseball game, not the latest cosmetics, not acting cool to your neighbors, but life and death, freedom and slavery.
[02:29:51.226 --> 02:29:55.148]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.148 --> 02:29:57.830]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.632 --> 02:30:04.815]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:30:04.815 --> 02:30:11.220]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:30:11.220 --> 02:30:18.606]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:30:18.606 --> 02:30:23.489]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:30:31.156 --> 02:30:32.978]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[02:31:04.492 --> 02:31:05.753]  Tyranny is here.
[02:31:05.753 --> 02:31:09.417]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:31:09.417 --> 02:31:11.919]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:31:11.919 --> 02:31:17.785]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:31:17.785 --> 02:31:24.012]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:31:24.452 --> 02:31:30.397]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:31:30.397 --> 02:31:34.600]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:31:34.600 --> 02:31:38.904]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:31:38.904 --> 02:31:44.849]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:31:44.849 --> 02:31:48.412]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:31:48.412 --> 02:31:50.393]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:31:50.393 --> 02:31:50.814]  It's here.

[02:33:09.085 --> 02:33:11.566]  Catherine Austin Fitch is our guest.
[02:33:11.566 --> 02:33:14.367]  We're talking about the most important subject there is.
[02:33:14.367 --> 02:33:22.890]  The global government, the elite, their mindset, how they control the planet, where they're going.
[02:33:22.890 --> 02:33:28.932]  Again, Catherine Austin Fitch is a former Assistant Secretary of Housing, Federal Housing Commissioner under Bush 1.
[02:33:28.932 --> 02:33:34.154]  The website is solari.com.
[02:33:34.154 --> 02:33:35.295]  Excellent info up there.
[02:33:37.080 --> 02:33:51.009]  Okay, I'm going to try to just sit back and give you the floor because I want you to give people the overview of who we're dealing with, what their endgame is, what the next phase of their operations is going to be, and how we stop them, how we get out of this trap of being dependent on them.
[02:33:51.009 --> 02:33:57.814]  You notice all they ever want to do is get us more dependent so that there's basically no way to get away from these people.
[02:33:57.814 --> 02:33:57.994]  Right.
[02:33:59.139 --> 02:34:05.502]  Well, it's a big series of about a thousand questions, but let me just start.
[02:34:05.502 --> 02:34:11.684]  Because I used to have a pastor in Washington who used to say, if we can fix it, God can fix it.
[02:34:11.684 --> 02:34:19.788]  And a lot of the solutions accelerate, Alex, the day that everyone sits back and says, you know, these guys are as nuts as Alex Jones says they are.
[02:34:21.381 --> 02:34:26.604]  Because all this stuff about slavery and police state, you know, those are reasonable words.
[02:34:26.604 --> 02:34:28.065]  That is where they're going.
[02:34:28.065 --> 02:34:40.532]  And, you know, I say this as a former regulator, a former assistant secretary of housing, a former board member of a Wall Street firm, a former board member of Sallie Mae, the student loan finance organization.
[02:34:40.532 --> 02:34:42.633]  And let me tell you how I came to that conclusion.
[02:34:42.633 --> 02:34:47.896]  And, you know, part of my background is doing portfolio strategy.
[02:34:48.696 --> 02:34:55.601]  You know, I was the FHA Commissioner, so doing portfolio strategy for $300 billion of liabilities.
[02:34:55.601 --> 02:35:00.084]  And then my company in Washington, the Hamilton Securities Group, built databases.
[02:35:01.022 --> 02:35:13.909]  Of all, you know, sort of community assets and real estate, which is looking at the entire GNP, and then when we compared it to certain things in the securities and global markets, you're talking about the GNP of the planet.
[02:35:13.909 --> 02:35:18.772]  So I'm used to dealing in very large numbers and actuarial analysis.
[02:35:18.772 --> 02:35:25.575]  So, you know, and actuarially analysis says, well, if you stop feeding people GMO food, they're going to live longer.
[02:35:25.575 --> 02:35:30.038]  That means insurance companies are going to have to pay out this much more, you know, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:35:30.798 --> 02:35:38.863]  So you're used to dealing in very big numbers and the butterfly effect of changes in policy with changes in lifespan.
[02:35:38.863 --> 02:35:40.924]  So I give that as a background.
[02:35:40.924 --> 02:35:43.085]  And I wrote this in the article I wrote.
[02:35:43.085 --> 02:35:48.788]  I wrote an essay about why I was opposed to the swine flu vaccination.
[02:35:48.788 --> 02:35:55.312]  And I literally, when I saw the policies that were being implemented in connection with the rollout of the WTO,
[02:35:56.138 --> 02:36:00.000]  And the control of agribusiness worldwide.
[02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:06.783]  The rounding up of innocent people in American communities and stuffed into prison and the private prison property.
[02:36:06.783 --> 02:36:08.985]  I went through all the different trends from 96 to 98.
[02:36:08.985 --> 02:36:23.552]  And I came to the conclusion, sort of back of the envelope, that the only thing I could conclude was that the leadership as a policy was planning on very significant depopulation worldwide.
[02:36:24.113 --> 02:36:40.877]  That was the only way I could explain, you know, the 20 policies I was seeing being implemented both here and globally with the WTO, particularly the control of the food supply and system with the, with sort of what Monsanto is doing in genetically modified food.
[02:36:40.877 --> 02:36:46.419]  And I was very quiet about it at the time, you know, because I knew other people couldn't fathom what I was saying.
[02:36:46.419 --> 02:36:48.019]  And I remember in 1998 or 99,
[02:36:51.269 --> 02:36:58.530]  A very, very savvy portfolio strategist from the financial community called me up and said, can you have lunch with me?
[02:36:58.530 --> 02:36:59.850]  I'm going to be in Washington.
[02:36:59.850 --> 02:37:07.652]  And we went to lunch at Union Station and he looked at me and he said, you know, he said, I know this is going to sound crazy, but I've done the analysis.
[02:37:07.652 --> 02:37:16.173]  And if you look at the changes in policies that are being rolled out over the last four years, the only thing I can conclude is they're planning on significant depopulation.
[02:37:16.173 --> 02:37:18.774]  And I said, well, that's what my analysis shows.
[02:37:18.774 --> 02:37:20.534]  And we just kind of stared at each other.
[02:37:21.931 --> 02:37:38.675]  And if you look across the board at what is being done in terms of building databases on American citizens, what is being done with RFID, you know, RFID, is it RFID or RFDI?
[02:37:38.675 --> 02:37:41.736]  Well, they've got a bunch of different ones, but let me just stop you for a moment.
[02:37:41.736 --> 02:37:42.576]  Okay.
[02:37:42.576 --> 02:37:48.938]  Because you did, as this huge actuary analyst running hundreds of millions of dollars, you saw it
[02:37:50.985 --> 02:37:59.473]  Like if somebody sees a guy pull up in a van and start chasing a house and then check on the front door you think maybe they're about to try to rob us.
[02:37:59.473 --> 02:38:07.200]  I have been at the guy's house as a fly on the wall and heard him talk about how he's going to rob and so separately
[02:38:07.800 --> 02:38:09.261]  And of course you know all this now.
[02:38:09.261 --> 02:38:24.510]  It turns out for 50 years they've been planning this and building a world government as a means to an end and all of the tracking, all of the surveillance, all the police state, all the mind control, the conditioning is to be rolled out in phases and we're now coming into the endgame.
[02:38:24.770 --> 02:38:26.410]  You're coming into the end of it.
[02:38:26.410 --> 02:38:30.071]  To literally kill 80% of people, how do we stop this?
[02:38:30.071 --> 02:38:40.673]  And again, in the phases, they shut the resources off, so then you become dependent on government, so it has you in its kill grid, the drugging, the cancer viruses, and the shots, the mercury.
[02:38:40.673 --> 02:38:42.073]  I mean, it's all happening.
[02:38:42.073 --> 02:38:43.133]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:38:43.133 --> 02:38:47.874]  Well, the food is poisoning us, the vaccines are poisoning us, on and on and on.
[02:38:47.874 --> 02:38:49.394]  Here's the thing to understand.
[02:38:49.394 --> 02:38:52.615]  Theoretically, there is a way to stop them.
[02:38:52.615 --> 02:38:54.535]  There really is a way to stop them because
[02:38:55.345 --> 02:38:55.806]  I don't know.
[02:39:17.953 --> 02:39:21.717]  Um, you know, what we all can't do is get in a bus and go to Washington today.
[02:39:21.717 --> 02:39:27.203]  You know, there are many ideas of what we can do that waste a huge amount of our time and effort that we don't have.
[02:39:27.203 --> 02:39:37.675]  But step number one you can do, and it's one that will give you a lot of energy, if you sequence it right and get as far away from them as you possibly can, or the people who implement their wishes,
[02:39:38.355 --> 02:39:40.656]  No, get out of the big cities.
[02:39:40.656 --> 02:39:43.076]  I say number one, get to know your neighbors.
[02:39:43.076 --> 02:39:44.657]  Stop watching as much television.
[02:39:44.657 --> 02:39:45.277]  Get healthy.
[02:39:45.277 --> 02:39:46.457]  Purify your water.
[02:39:46.457 --> 02:39:49.298]  But more importantly, recognize them as the enemy.
[02:39:49.298 --> 02:39:51.258]  Don't just believe Catherine Austin Fitz.
[02:39:51.258 --> 02:39:52.859]  Don't just believe Alex Jones.
[02:39:52.859 --> 02:40:02.641]  Find out we're telling you the truth and this is life and death and then the ballgame isn't going to matter so much and take all your energies and stop seeing Catherine Austin Fitz as your champion.
[02:40:02.641 --> 02:40:04.661]  Stop seeing Alex Jones as your champion.
[02:40:04.661 --> 02:40:07.182]  You know, she's not Joan of Arc and I'm not George Washington.
[02:40:10.307 --> 02:40:18.494]  You know, it's really funny, and when you withdraw, all your ideas are great, but you want to get as financially not dependent on them as possible.
[02:40:18.494 --> 02:40:23.158]  So get as far away as you can from government money or money that they control.
[02:40:23.158 --> 02:40:31.225]  One of the things that is just a profoundly important thing is everybody tomorrow in the country, Alex, said, you know,
[02:40:31.845 --> 02:40:38.607]  Any bank that's trading derivatives or any of the big banks that got bailout money, I'm getting as far away from them as I can.
[02:40:39.403 --> 02:40:50.190]  So if you pulled your money out of the big banks and went to a well-managed local bank tomorrow, it would have a profound and dramatic impact.
[02:40:50.190 --> 02:40:54.012]  Now you can say, well, all those banks channel money into Wall Street anyway.
[02:40:54.012 --> 02:41:02.237]  If I'm the Federal Reserve and I have to negotiate with 25,000 bank presidents as opposed to 10, it's a very different picture, it's a very different world.
[02:41:02.873 --> 02:41:22.684]  Okay, so anything you can do, it's real funny, I have a member of my network who's Jewish, whose family was really hurt in the Holocaust, and he was asking me whether or not he should bank at a big bank, and I said, you know, you're basically asking me whether you should put your money with him or money management or not.
[02:41:23.433 --> 02:41:25.315]  Now, why are you asking me that question?
[02:41:25.315 --> 02:41:27.737]  Don't you know better?
[02:41:27.737 --> 02:41:28.738]  But that's what we're doing.
[02:41:28.738 --> 02:41:38.027]  We're financing... If you look at any activist group who's opposed to any of the things they say they... Let's say the guys are opposed to GMO.
[02:41:38.027 --> 02:41:44.594]  Well, if you look at where their money is, they're all financing the creation of GMOs and the building of that infrastructure.
[02:41:44.594 --> 02:41:45.675]  When you finance the U.S.
[02:41:45.675 --> 02:41:48.057]  government, you're financing genetically modified seed.
[02:41:48.786 --> 02:41:51.649]  You're financing the implementation of that.
[02:41:51.649 --> 02:41:54.771]  So part of it is withdraw as much as you can.
[02:41:54.771 --> 02:41:59.496]  Your person, your family, how you spend your time, don't be financially dependent.
[02:41:59.496 --> 02:42:04.661]  But stop financing the very things that are killing you and your family.
[02:42:04.661 --> 02:42:05.441]  Absolutely.
[02:42:05.441 --> 02:42:09.225]  Now, other solutions.
[02:42:10.782 --> 02:42:13.563]  I mean, I jumped in there when you said get as far away as you can from their money.
[02:42:13.563 --> 02:42:15.184]  Okay, here's the next solution.
[02:42:15.184 --> 02:42:20.888]  Who are you supporting for sheriff in this local election?
[02:42:20.888 --> 02:42:38.799]  Okay, if 3,100 counties, the sheriff, there's dual sovereignty under the Constitution, so your sheriff can literally tell the federal government to get off, you know, your county property and know they may not enforce something that is outside the 10th Amendment.
[02:42:39.631 --> 02:42:48.297]  Okay, so we're coming into election, the election cycle, and the election cycle is always a time, Alex, when you can be talking to your neighbors about all these issues.
[02:42:48.297 --> 02:42:57.203]  And let me tell you something, the fact that the bailouts and healthcare passed without having any kind of popular, sufficient popular support for a change of that
[02:42:57.998 --> 02:42:59.119]  Extraordinary nature.
[02:42:59.119 --> 02:43:03.181]  It's got people worked up and they're ready to have a conversation.
[02:43:03.181 --> 02:43:08.464]  So, number one, you want to get into office the right kind of sheriff and you want your sheriff.
[02:43:08.464 --> 02:43:18.190]  Is your sheriff out there doing crime patrol or is your sheriff instead spending all of your tax money foreclosing on people on behalf of the big bank?
[02:43:18.190 --> 02:43:20.191]  And trying to squeeze people and raise revenue.
[02:43:20.191 --> 02:43:24.333]  We've always promoted patriot sheriffs, so we're on the same page on that front.
[02:43:24.333 --> 02:43:27.295]  The second thing is, in your state and local areas,
[02:43:27.887 --> 02:43:32.390]  You have candidates who are proposing 10th Amendment legislation.
[02:43:32.390 --> 02:43:35.712]  So, for example, Idaho passed the Health Freedom Act.
[02:43:35.712 --> 02:43:39.475]  We have lots of states trying to pass the Health Freedom Act.
[02:43:39.475 --> 02:43:45.078]  We have lots of states, you know, doing a variety of things on the 10th Amendment.
[02:43:45.078 --> 02:43:47.940]  There's a great 10th Amendment center online.
[02:43:47.940 --> 02:43:55.025]  So you want to find out where are the state and local representatives who are active on 10th Amendment, and you want to get hooked up in supporting them.
[02:43:56.195 --> 02:43:56.875]  Okay.
[02:43:56.875 --> 02:43:59.157]  But the number one message here is get up.
[02:43:59.157 --> 02:44:01.458]  Don't just count on other people to do it.
[02:44:01.458 --> 02:44:03.019]  Now, I want to get into some other issues.
[02:44:03.019 --> 02:44:07.962]  I'm going to talk about some more solutions here, but I also want to talk about what their endgame is.
[02:44:07.962 --> 02:44:11.164]  Studying these larger... Okay, so can I mention one other thing?
[02:44:11.164 --> 02:44:12.265]  Go ahead.
[02:44:12.265 --> 02:44:15.927]  Stop giving them your data.
[02:44:15.927 --> 02:44:16.968]  There's Edwin Black.
[02:44:16.968 --> 02:44:18.329]  Have you ever had Edwin Black on?
[02:44:19.219 --> 02:44:19.359]  Yes.
[02:44:19.359 --> 02:44:24.422]  Emma Black wrote the book about IBM building the database and computer systems for the Holocaust?
[02:44:24.422 --> 02:44:24.942]  Yes.
[02:44:24.942 --> 02:44:25.662]  Okay.
[02:44:25.662 --> 02:44:40.650]  Well, any kind of police state or any kind of slavery depends seriously on having the infrastructure you need, the database and computer infrastructure you need to manage large populations.
[02:44:40.650 --> 02:44:47.653]  So it's just like if you're a farmer and you have livestock, you need great data and great databases if you're going to manage the population.
[02:44:48.564 --> 02:44:49.644]  Ditto here.
[02:44:49.644 --> 02:45:17.053]  And what we're watching in the health care bill, in a variety of different legislations and policies, and now with the census, is the effort to build the definitive database infrastructure that will allow them to define where you live, who you live with, connect up your health care databases, connect up your tax information if they want to, connect up all sorts of private commercial information they have about your spending habits,
[02:45:17.840 --> 02:45:19.521]  Well that's what this bill does.
[02:45:19.521 --> 02:45:21.643]  It says the IRS looks at the health care you're getting.
[02:45:21.643 --> 02:45:26.827]  You can take money out of your savings account, medical savings account.
[02:45:26.827 --> 02:45:32.010]  You were talking about how they're putting in new laws to track all your money or not let you get your money out of the country.
[02:45:32.010 --> 02:45:33.872]  The elites already pulled their money out.
[02:45:33.872 --> 02:45:37.855]  Now they want to make sure the middle class has to stay here and basically be sucked dry.
[02:45:37.855 --> 02:45:38.475]  Right.
[02:45:38.475 --> 02:45:42.558]  So what you want to do, the first thing you want to do is you want to get your data out of the system.
[02:45:42.558 --> 02:45:43.659]  Stop giving them data.
[02:45:44.361 --> 02:45:44.581]  Okay.
[02:46:00.808 --> 02:46:05.452]  Put our money in a stock, get a dividend, and then go buy water from the water company.
[02:46:05.452 --> 02:46:10.937]  But also, if we live in a rural area, we can just stop being in the middle, and we can go out and build a well.
[02:46:10.937 --> 02:46:13.759]  And then I don't need your stock, and I don't need your dividend.
[02:46:13.759 --> 02:46:18.523]  And that's why they're moving nationwide and worldwide to block people drilling their own wells.
[02:46:18.523 --> 02:46:19.664]  Well, that's why.
[02:46:19.664 --> 02:46:24.528]  If you can, you want to live in an area where you still have the power to do that.
[02:46:24.528 --> 02:46:28.552]  Okay, we're running out of time, and it's clear I've got to have you back up for a full hour just on solutions.
[02:46:29.869 --> 02:46:31.290]  Those are all great solutions.
[02:46:31.290 --> 02:46:33.331]  I, number one, say wake people up.
[02:46:33.331 --> 02:46:36.513]  They're ready to be woken up to the full horror.
[02:46:36.513 --> 02:46:49.560]  But looking at their program and being able to factor in all these different elements on a wide spectrum analysis, what do you see as their game plan in the next six months to a year to two years, out to five years?
[02:46:49.560 --> 02:46:52.862]  How do you see them unrolling this global financial takeover?
[02:46:52.862 --> 02:46:55.884]  And then we'll dovetail that with this war-making economy
[02:46:56.641 --> 02:46:58.682]  That isn't just launching wars overseas.
[02:46:58.682 --> 02:47:05.785]  Naked body scanners, surveillance, face scanners, CPS, DynCorp out grabbing more children for no reason.
[02:47:05.785 --> 02:47:10.387]  The Texas case where they're taking people's kids now if their parents say don't trust the government.
[02:47:10.387 --> 02:47:11.868]  I mean, it's getting crazy.
[02:47:11.868 --> 02:47:12.068]  Right.
[02:47:12.068 --> 02:47:15.049]  No, it's well, it's been crazy for a long time.
[02:47:15.049 --> 02:47:17.890]  But it's going to become very crazy to most people.
[02:47:17.890 --> 02:47:26.194]  And I think what you need to do is first and foremost, you need to know that that if you are awake and out to protect yourself,
[02:47:26.897 --> 02:47:28.078]  They can't do this.
[02:47:28.078 --> 02:47:38.349]  And so the question is what... Step number one everybody has to do is turn off their TV and stop listening to their media and stay linked into media that's telling you the truth.
[02:47:38.349 --> 02:47:39.771]  That's step number one.
[02:47:39.771 --> 02:47:43.535]  Because the first way they control you, Alex, is with your mind.
[02:47:43.535 --> 02:47:45.697]  So the first step is get your mind clean.
[02:47:45.697 --> 02:47:46.999]  Don't let them control your mind.
[02:47:48.519 --> 02:47:58.330]  Well, I mean, how can a cop take a family's child and put on the CPS form they taught their children not to trust the government?
[02:47:58.330 --> 02:48:02.716]  I mean, that's right out of 1984, and these cops feel good while they're doing this.
[02:48:02.716 --> 02:48:04.377]  I mean, these are tyrants.
[02:48:04.377 --> 02:48:04.738]  You know why?
[02:48:04.738 --> 02:48:08.002]  Because I've seen this in my own situation when I was targeted.
[02:48:08.690 --> 02:48:13.655]  Every team, we had 18 audits and investigations at the Hamilton Securities Group.
[02:48:13.655 --> 02:48:20.460]  And when each one started, the people coming in to audit and investigate thought we were, you know, just bad, horrible people.
[02:48:20.460 --> 02:48:26.085]  And then we'd work with them, and before it was over, they'd be on our side against the government.
[02:48:26.085 --> 02:48:32.371]  But initially, they are taught to believe that you're bad people, and the problem is most people get defensive.
[02:48:33.203 --> 02:48:34.284]  And don't work through it.
[02:48:34.284 --> 02:48:40.747]  We were trained in spiritual warfare, so we saw it as our job to bring them across to the light, and usually did.
[02:48:40.747 --> 02:48:48.792]  And so, um, you know, they really don't know, and it's hard, Alex, for you to fathom that the system is that ugly or that evil.
[02:48:48.792 --> 02:48:51.794]  They really don't know, many of them.
[02:48:51.794 --> 02:48:53.415]  So we gotta, we gotta turn them around.
[02:48:54.099 --> 02:49:00.408]  When you saw our article last Friday, cops and CPS seize child from parent for mistrusting government.
[02:49:00.408 --> 02:49:04.313]  I was aware of this, but you sent me a lot of stuff that I actually wasn't aware of.
[02:49:04.313 --> 02:49:10.602]  We're going to be showing people some document cam shots right now with DynCorp heavily involved.
[02:49:11.601 --> 02:49:15.883]  Globally, it's been congressional hearings in white slavery, child kidnapping rings.
[02:49:15.883 --> 02:49:25.305]  They now have a new name, but CSC, Dime Corps, and the economics... Well, they merged into CSC, and then they got spun off and went public, so they're back to their old name.
[02:49:25.305 --> 02:49:26.686]  Okay, so, but I mean...
[02:49:27.458 --> 02:49:29.399]  I have all the mainstream news articles.
[02:49:29.399 --> 02:49:35.683]  This is literally a legion of doom, and that's all part of their military operation, and grabbing kids is very lucrative.
[02:49:35.683 --> 02:49:42.167]  Well, the scariest story in the world, and one that's hard for most people to get into, is the role of pedophilia.
[02:49:42.167 --> 02:49:44.989]  And pedophilia is a very old story, Alex.
[02:49:44.989 --> 02:49:46.350]  It's been used for years.
[02:49:47.116 --> 02:49:53.441]  You know, as both a personnel benefit, if you will, and a form of entrapment.
[02:49:53.441 --> 02:50:00.667]  Once you get a file, you know, once you get dirty pictures of somebody engaged in pedophilia, a politician or business leader, you own them for life.
[02:50:00.667 --> 02:50:03.190]  It's one of the most economic ways to control there is.
[02:50:03.190 --> 02:50:05.091]  I hate to say it, but that's the reality.
[02:50:05.091 --> 02:50:13.338]  If you look at the history of narcotics trafficking and mortgage fraud in this country, it's intimately linked with pedophilia and sex slavery.
[02:50:13.338 --> 02:50:15.320]  You know, I just hate to say it, but that's the way it is.
[02:50:16.090 --> 02:50:24.139]  And I got on to Dinecore in the 90s because you had a couple of whistleblowers when Dinecore was a government contract.
[02:50:24.139 --> 02:50:30.206]  You had their project managers literally engaged in owning, you know, buying and owning children and using them for sex.
[02:50:31.529 --> 02:50:34.911]  And working with the local mafias who were tracking it.
[02:50:34.911 --> 02:50:39.313]  And yet the State Department, where DynCorp is the biggest contract, was forgiving all of this.
[02:50:39.313 --> 02:50:41.535]  Anyway, this is all on the public record.
[02:50:41.535 --> 02:50:45.997]  And then DynCorp started to pop up in child protective services contracts around the country.
[02:50:46.756 --> 02:50:49.339]  If you suffer from poor sleep, you've gotta try MyPillow!
[02:51:04.534 --> 02:51:08.275]  Introducing the most revolutionary, most comfortable, and coolest pillow ever.

[02:52:01.283 --> 02:52:03.605]  They helped to create a New World Order.

[02:52:05.987 --> 02:52:09.190]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:09.190 --> 02:52:14.316]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:14.316 --> 02:52:18.500]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.800 --> 02:52:21.282]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:21.282 --> 02:52:23.704]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:23.704 --> 02:52:26.947]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:26.947 --> 02:52:34.553]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.893 --> 02:52:40.295]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:40.295 --> 02:52:42.596]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:42.596 --> 02:52:46.817]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:46.817 --> 02:52:47.898]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:47.898 --> 02:52:49.238]  You're everyone else.
[02:52:49.238 --> 02:52:50.739]  Invisible Empire.

[02:54:10.337 --> 02:54:16.121]  On the 21st of April, later this month, Catherine Austen Fitch will spend at least an hour with us.
[02:54:16.121 --> 02:54:18.483]  She's very, very gracious.
[02:54:18.483 --> 02:54:20.865]  We'll give you her website before she leaves us.
[02:54:20.865 --> 02:54:27.469]  But for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers, I was just showing mainstream news articles.
[02:54:27.469 --> 02:54:29.210]  I have congressional hearings for DynCorp.
[02:54:29.210 --> 02:54:32.953]  They say, well, you kidnapped tens of thousands of children for sex slaves.
[02:54:32.953 --> 02:54:35.615]  And then they asked Rumsfeld, why are they allowed to do this?
[02:54:35.615 --> 02:54:36.576]  And he just said, they just are.
[02:54:37.689 --> 02:54:42.391]  And again, the magnitude of the evil and DynCorp.
[02:54:42.391 --> 02:54:51.013]  I know some of this, but she sent me a link to news articles and government purchase orders where they're involved all over warehousing the kids once they're taken.
[02:54:51.013 --> 02:54:55.055]  So now, it's not enough to grab Iraqi kids or Serb kids, now they're grabbing our kids.
[02:54:55.055 --> 02:54:56.915]  Catherine, finish your story.
[02:54:56.915 --> 02:55:01.537]  Okay, so I'm... The way I got onto this was I was...
[02:55:02.606 --> 02:55:11.074]  In Washington, and I had come on to DynCorp because of their role in the war on drugs, and I'll tell you two stories.
[02:55:11.074 --> 02:55:25.146]  The first was a group of peasant women from South America came up to give a presentation to congressmen, and they gave a presentation in Washington on how they were being moved off their land.
[02:55:25.146 --> 02:55:29.290]  Private people were picking up their land for cheap, and then the government was building housing.
[02:55:30.171 --> 02:55:32.372]  You know, this whole war on drugs game.
[02:55:32.372 --> 02:55:36.274]  And so I kept asking them questions and finally they got very suspicious.
[02:55:36.274 --> 02:55:39.576]  And said, how come you know so much about how the money works in our country?
[02:55:39.576 --> 02:55:47.240]  And I said, well, I was the Assistant Secretary of Housing and apparently it works the same way in your country as it works at ours.
[02:55:47.240 --> 02:55:58.726]  So afterwards I did a little research and discovered the same contractor in enforcement at HUD in this country was the lead contractor in Latin America on the war on drugs.
[02:55:58.726 --> 02:55:59.467]  It was DynCorp.
[02:56:00.157 --> 02:56:17.948]  So I started to get in and look at DynCorp and on and on and on and that's when the story of the sex slave trafficking came out and it was unbelievable because Insight Magazine, Alex, wrote a great story about sex slave trafficking, the allegations in connection with the DynCorp litigation.
[02:56:17.948 --> 02:56:25.653]  Those magazines cover story were dropped on every senator and every congressman's desk
[02:56:26.320 --> 02:56:31.543]  And the next week, both the Navy and the State Department gave huge new contracts to DynCorp.
[02:56:31.543 --> 02:56:33.204]  You know, so it didn't seem to matter.
[02:56:33.204 --> 02:56:35.025]  It was quite amazing.
[02:56:35.025 --> 02:56:47.451]  Anyway, so fast forward, I ended up writing a series of stories about DynCorp and illuminating what was going on because, in fact, the Chairman of the Finance Committee at Enron
[02:56:48.320 --> 02:56:48.961]  I don't think so.
[02:57:04.717 --> 02:57:13.400]  I, and of course, Dyncor is a big contractor at the Department of Justice and was said by the in-flaw people to be one of the managers of the PROMIS software.
[02:57:13.400 --> 02:57:30.105]  Anyway, so, we're in the middle of a litigation and I have a person, one of the people working for me, helping me do the litigation support work, which was very time-consuming, came to me and said, you know, somebody from Child Protective Services showed up at my house.
[02:57:31.269 --> 02:57:35.071]  And, uh, she's an only, you know, she's a single mom.
[02:57:35.071 --> 02:57:37.011]  We've got a minute and a half left, so finish up on this.
[02:57:37.011 --> 02:57:40.413]  And so she said, I'm sure it's a mistake, and I said, no, no, no, no, this is dangerous.
[02:57:40.413 --> 02:57:41.873]  We need to research.
[02:57:41.873 --> 02:57:47.435]  Find out if DynCorp is the contractor for Child Protective Services.
[02:57:47.435 --> 02:57:51.097]  Sure enough, they were, and we literally had to get her to move to another state.
[02:57:51.696 --> 02:58:12.564]  And this is a child molestation army, so go... Well, but what you need to... So last week when I saw what was going on in Texas, I said, you want to check and see whether DynCorp is behind, you know, is in the mix, because the idea of going after people's children just because they disagree with government policy, this is a real risk.
[02:58:12.564 --> 02:58:13.285]  This is Pierre Abel.
[02:58:13.285 --> 02:58:15.165]  Do you have one more point you wanted to make?
[02:58:15.165 --> 02:58:17.246]  Yes, I just wanted to thank you, Alex.
[02:58:17.246 --> 02:58:21.228]  You sent two of your incredible producers down to my house
[02:58:21.997 --> 02:58:25.519]  Um, during a snowstorm, they came all the way out from Memphis in a snowstorm.
[02:58:25.519 --> 02:58:27.000]  I never thought they'd make it.
[02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:28.241]  We spent a day filming.
[02:58:28.241 --> 02:58:29.582]  They were so intelligent.
[02:58:29.582 --> 02:58:30.723]  They were so professional.
[02:58:30.723 --> 02:58:32.324]  They were so capable.
[02:58:32.324 --> 02:58:36.746]  I said, wow, you know, Alex Jones is going to a whole new level.
[02:58:36.746 --> 02:58:37.527]  What a team.
[02:58:37.527 --> 02:58:38.347]  I was very impressed.
[02:58:38.347 --> 02:58:39.288]  You're a sweetheart.
[02:58:39.288 --> 02:58:40.469]  Katherine Austin Fitz.
[02:58:40.469 --> 02:58:42.650]  God bless.

[03:00:09.544 --> 03:00:11.304]  Government cover-ups.

[03:00:18.626 --> 03:00:25.908]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:25.908 --> 03:00:29.469]  You are the target of the New World Order.
[03:00:29.469 --> 03:00:32.290]  Governments killed more than 200 million people last century.
[03:00:33.340 --> 03:00:35.741]  We're already off to a great start this century.
[03:00:35.741 --> 03:00:37.961]  Millions and millions killed.
[03:00:37.961 --> 03:00:43.342]  Over a million and a half Iraqis, thanks to our criminal wars.
[03:00:43.342 --> 03:00:45.563]  And we are the target here in the United States.
[03:00:45.563 --> 03:00:54.005]  All you eugenicists, all you social Darwinists, all you fake environmentalists, you're all under savage attack by your own masters.
[03:00:54.005 --> 03:00:58.006]  We've got a very informative guest coming up for the rest of the hour in the next segment.
[03:00:59.788 --> 03:01:01.868]  And then we got Bob Chapman coming on about the economy.
[03:01:01.868 --> 03:01:06.189]  I'll intersperse important news when he's on with us like this news.
[03:01:06.189 --> 03:01:09.270]  North Korea warns it will meet war with all-out war.
[03:01:09.270 --> 03:01:10.250]  CNN.
[03:01:10.250 --> 03:01:11.870]  Geithner talks up stability deal.
[03:01:11.870 --> 03:01:14.111]  That's the new world government.
[03:01:14.111 --> 03:01:16.271]  They're setting up via the banking system.
[03:01:16.271 --> 03:01:19.212]  They create the crisis, offer the solution.
[03:01:19.212 --> 03:01:21.572]  French minister says bailout alters EU treaty.
[03:01:21.572 --> 03:01:24.073]  You know, violates it.
[03:01:24.073 --> 03:01:27.274]  Goldman seeks to avoid fraud in settlement report.
[03:01:27.274 --> 03:01:29.034]  The government's already dropped charges on AIG.
[03:01:30.322 --> 03:01:40.089]  And then pass the Banking Reform Act that lets them spy on everything you do in your bank account, take over local small banks that are healthy, gives the criminal banks all the power over everything.
[03:01:40.089 --> 03:01:53.238]  As Dr. Paul Craig Roberts told you yesterday, former head of Policy Department of the Treasury, again, it's not just me saying that or the Texas Banking Association saying that, Goldman Sachs and others are really going to rape everybody now.
[03:01:53.238 --> 03:01:56.381]  Oh, you set up a huge implosion to consolidate power.
[03:01:56.381 --> 03:01:57.241]  Here, here's more power.
[03:01:57.241 --> 03:01:57.822]  That will teach you.
[03:02:00.499 --> 03:02:09.763]  Blowouts coming in California with a regime change in November, and it says that all the polls show that every mainline Democratic incumbent and a lot of Republican incumbents are in trouble.
[03:02:09.763 --> 03:02:10.643]  Well, what do you expect?
[03:02:10.643 --> 03:02:19.106]  You've got a gun-grabbing, open-border-promoting globalist who promotes global warming and carbon taxes, Arnold A. Lewis.
[03:02:19.106 --> 03:02:20.727]  He admires Hitler, Schwarzenegger.
[03:02:21.508 --> 03:02:24.089]  I mean, California, you get what you deserve.
[03:02:24.089 --> 03:02:28.351]  You're into trendiness, you're into acting cool, you're into the New World Order.
[03:02:28.351 --> 03:02:31.392]  Well, now they're trying to pass taxes on exit taxes.
[03:02:31.392 --> 03:02:32.953]  We won't be able to escape California.
[03:02:32.953 --> 03:02:45.158]  It's a beautiful state, got a lot of wonderful people in it, but it's also got a lot of airheads in it, and California better wake up and go absolutely ape now, or you will be fully imploded by the globalists.
[03:02:45.158 --> 03:02:46.879]  They want you to fail, you understand that?
[03:02:49.053 --> 03:02:49.793]  In fact, here's another one.
[03:02:49.793 --> 03:02:53.816]  Bankruptcy talk spreads among California municipal officials.
[03:02:53.816 --> 03:03:17.888]  And then they'll go bankrupt to the state, the state will go bankrupt, this is out of Reuters, and then they'll go bankrupt to the foreign bankers, who will wave a magic fairy wand and go, oh, here's a hundred million more, we just made it up, but now we own you, and now it's not at 10% interest, California, now it's at 20% interest, and you better raise more taxes, you better shake down everybody there to give us real assets,
[03:03:18.786 --> 03:03:22.909]  Because we made it up out of nothing, and we're the bankers, and you're a bunch of gullible idiots!
[03:03:22.909 --> 03:03:25.191]  And every other state, Texas, it doesn't matter.
[03:03:25.191 --> 03:03:28.154]  They're going to rape every one of you until you get angry and wake up.
[03:03:28.154 --> 03:03:29.195]  They're never going to stop.
[03:03:29.195 --> 03:03:31.977]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[03:03:31.977 --> 03:03:34.719]  Here's a big article by Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:03:34.719 --> 03:03:35.079]  Guess what?
[03:03:35.079 --> 03:03:45.508]  We found out that the same corporation that did the bond proposal and built the hardened $28 million facility that no one ever moved into, that we have the blueprints for, that is to be used by FEMA,
[03:03:46.678 --> 03:03:48.660]  That's up on our Alex Jones YouTube channel.
[03:03:48.660 --> 03:03:52.383]  Private corporation building detention camps across America.
[03:03:52.383 --> 03:03:54.645]  Cole Watson wrote this yesterday.
[03:03:54.645 --> 03:03:58.248]  Have him add that YouTube video I posted of inside the facility.
[03:03:58.248 --> 03:04:00.810]  I was getting a tour and she goes, oh, excuse me, the phone's ringing.
[03:04:00.810 --> 03:04:02.051]  I went, oh, thank you.
[03:04:02.051 --> 03:04:08.556]  Ducked into three offices, ran in, blueprints on a table, hidden in plain view, flipping through them.
[03:04:08.556 --> 03:04:11.438]  It says alien detention facility.
[03:04:11.438 --> 03:04:13.140]  And that doesn't mean little green men, folks.
[03:04:13.140 --> 03:04:13.880]  That means U.S.
[03:04:13.880 --> 03:04:14.741]  citizen script.
[03:04:15.516 --> 03:04:19.417]  Under the Enemy Combatant Act.
[03:04:19.417 --> 03:04:19.958]  And put in there.
[03:04:19.958 --> 03:04:21.538]  And CNN admits that.
[03:04:21.538 --> 03:04:24.559]  They were looking at the facility as a detention facility.
[03:04:24.559 --> 03:04:26.780]  For citizens and others.
[03:04:26.780 --> 03:04:29.441]  And we went and showed the blueprints.
[03:04:29.441 --> 03:04:32.862]  But the issue is the same companies building them all over the U.S.
[03:04:32.862 --> 03:04:36.404]  And getting sucker locals to fund it.
[03:04:36.404 --> 03:04:39.145]  So that's coming up when Bob Chapman's on with us.
[03:04:39.145 --> 03:04:42.826]  Also, G20 Toronto police make first summit arrests for banks vandalized.
[03:04:43.559 --> 03:04:49.522]  Congressman says Obama may have spent 10 million on illegal Kenya abortion push.
[03:04:49.522 --> 03:04:52.024]  They admit ultrasound sterilizes men.
[03:04:52.024 --> 03:04:54.225]  So why is it safe for fetuses?
[03:04:54.225 --> 03:04:57.567]  Bill Gates and his covert nanotechnology vaccine.
[03:04:57.567 --> 03:04:58.187]  It's all coming up.
[03:05:01.411 --> 03:05:04.432]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:04.432 --> 03:05:09.753]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:05:09.753 --> 03:05:11.794]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:05:11.794 --> 03:05:16.795]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:16.795 --> 03:05:17.976]  How much do you want?
[03:05:17.976 --> 03:05:18.716]  When do you want it?
[03:05:19.096 --> 03:05:20.977]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:20.977 --> 03:05:22.058]  When will you need it?
[03:05:22.058 --> 03:05:24.260]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:24.260 --> 03:05:25.601]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:25.601 --> 03:05:27.142]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:27.142 --> 03:05:32.406]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:32.406 --> 03:05:35.528]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:35.968 --> 03:05:39.789]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:39.789 --> 03:05:41.029]  How much will you need?
[03:05:41.029 --> 03:05:41.930]  We don't know.
[03:05:41.930 --> 03:05:43.030]  How much do you want?
[03:05:43.030 --> 03:05:43.950]  All you can get.
[03:05:43.950 --> 03:05:45.050]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.050 --> 03:05:48.111]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:05:48.111 --> 03:05:49.871]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:05:49.871 --> 03:05:50.792]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:00.387 --> 03:06:04.930]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:06:04.930 --> 03:06:05.850]  Number 1.
[03:06:05.850 --> 03:06:09.273]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:06:09.273 --> 03:06:10.133]  Number 2.
[03:06:10.133 --> 03:06:15.016]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:06:15.016 --> 03:06:15.757]  It's true.
[03:06:15.757 --> 03:06:20.640]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:06:20.640 --> 03:06:21.460]  Number 3.
[03:06:21.460 --> 03:06:25.063]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:06:25.063 --> 03:06:28.745]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:06:28.945 --> 03:06:29.745]  Number 4.
[03:06:29.745 --> 03:06:32.506]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:06:32.506 --> 03:06:36.188]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:06:36.188 --> 03:06:36.988]  Number 5.
[03:06:36.988 --> 03:06:41.130]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:06:41.130 --> 03:06:46.172]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:06:46.172 --> 03:06:50.353]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[03:07:52.874 --> 03:07:53.535]  Thank you!
[03:08:06.517 --> 03:08:07.817]  Big Brother.
[03:08:07.817 --> 03:08:09.598]  Mainstream media.
[03:08:09.598 --> 03:08:11.358]  Government cover-ups.
[03:08:11.358 --> 03:08:12.938]  You want answers?
[03:08:12.938 --> 03:08:13.859]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:13.859 --> 03:08:18.680]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:18.680 --> 03:08:24.281]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:24.281 --> 03:08:25.721]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:08:25.721 --> 03:08:30.562]  Thank you for joining us the 28th day of May, 2010 on this Friday edition.
[03:08:31.491 --> 03:08:38.973]  Two days ago, we posted the amazing article written by Paul Joseph Watson at PrisonPilot.com and InfoWars.com.
[03:08:38.973 --> 03:08:43.994]  Pop construction firm, WTC, destroyed by controlled demolition.
[03:08:43.994 --> 03:08:54.396]  Now remember just a month ago, back on April 23rd, the headline, bombshell, Silverstein wanted to demolish Building 7 on 9-1-1.
[03:08:54.396 --> 03:08:56.116]  That is from Fox News.
[03:08:57.188 --> 03:09:00.150]  But the Fox News reporters said, I was there that day.
[03:09:00.150 --> 03:09:02.771]  I was with Silberstein and the emergency management people.
[03:09:02.771 --> 03:09:06.373]  And yes, they did say they were looking at wiring and blowing up 7.
[03:09:06.373 --> 03:09:09.395]  But magically, it fell on its own, so we didn't have to blow it up.
[03:09:09.395 --> 03:09:13.797]  Well, it takes weeks, if not months, to properly demolish a 47-story building.
[03:09:13.797 --> 03:09:16.479]  A few years ago, they tried to blow up the Intel building in Austin.
[03:09:16.479 --> 03:09:17.840]  A top firm did.
[03:09:17.840 --> 03:09:18.400]  It failed.
[03:09:19.691 --> 03:09:27.916]  Intel in the late 90s during the dot-com bust finished the skeleton of the building, then it collapsed, the dot-com bubble, so that they never finished it.
[03:09:27.916 --> 03:09:31.698]  But they couldn't even blow up the skeleton of it on the first try.
[03:09:31.698 --> 03:09:34.100]  The superstructure.
[03:09:34.100 --> 03:09:42.084]  And then we have all the police and firemen footage, I'm not gonna go back over today, we may play some, where the cops are saying, get back, get back, get back, we're gonna blow it up.
[03:09:42.084 --> 03:09:44.126]  We're gonna blow up seven.
[03:09:44.126 --> 03:09:44.686]  And I remember
[03:09:45.945 --> 03:09:48.366]  Being in the car that day, I'd been on air all day.
[03:09:48.366 --> 03:09:53.268]  I ran out of the studio to get a pizza, literally a half mile away, to scarf it.
[03:09:53.268 --> 03:09:57.009]  I was scarfing it in the car as I was driving back to go back on air.
[03:09:57.009 --> 03:10:03.812]  And they were on ABC News saying they're going to blow up Building 7.
[03:10:03.812 --> 03:10:06.193]  And then I talked about it and people said, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[03:10:06.193 --> 03:10:15.497]  Well, it turns out there's scores of newscasts now, including BBC, where they did a false script and announced that it had fallen in its own footprint 25 minutes before it did.
[03:10:16.616 --> 03:10:20.177]  So, look, there's no doubt, folks, they blew up Building 7.
[03:10:20.177 --> 03:10:25.298]  We had Barry Jennings, the deputy head of New York Emergency Management, on.
[03:10:25.298 --> 03:10:28.718]  Two weeks later, he died mysteriously.
[03:10:28.718 --> 03:10:30.999]  And he was getting threats.
[03:10:30.999 --> 03:10:33.339]  And he said, yeah, they blew up Building 7.
[03:10:33.339 --> 03:10:35.059]  So this isn't a game we're playing.
[03:10:35.059 --> 03:10:36.980]  I mean, I hope you understand that.
[03:10:36.980 --> 03:10:44.761]  Now, you can debate who carried out 9-11, who had the means, opportunity, the motive, and who thought they could get away with it.
[03:10:46.016 --> 03:10:49.617]  And that's the Western power structure, no one else.
[03:10:49.617 --> 03:10:53.677]  That's England, the U.S., Israel, they're all joined at the hip.
[03:10:53.677 --> 03:11:02.479]  But for the next hour, and a little bit into the next hour that Bob Chapman's joining us, Alan Hart joins us because he's another window into this.
[03:11:02.479 --> 03:11:10.980]  You know, you have this Fox News reporter going with the lie, saying, yeah, okay, we were there, they were talking about blowing it up, but we didn't.
[03:11:10.980 --> 03:11:13.141]  So you're a conspiracy theorist forever saying we did.
[03:11:14.497 --> 03:11:18.139]  And then you've got all the firemen, you know, saying, yeah, they told us they blew it up.
[03:11:18.139 --> 03:11:19.559]  And then they get fired or threatened.
[03:11:19.559 --> 03:11:21.700]  And the cops saying, yeah, they said they blew it up.
[03:11:21.700 --> 03:11:24.041]  I've interviewed those cops, Bartmer and others.
[03:11:24.041 --> 03:11:29.563]  I've gone and found the cops who were on the CNN video saying, get back, they're bringing it down, folks.
[03:11:29.563 --> 03:11:33.185]  We have the live footage, get back, they're blowing it up.
[03:11:33.185 --> 03:11:36.066]  And then again, the cops weren't involved, they were brought into it.
[03:11:37.691 --> 03:11:43.935]  And then once they've accepted it, they just engage in Crimestopper, Doublethink, and then they don't talk about it.
[03:11:43.935 --> 03:11:44.736]  But I'm going to shut up.
[03:11:44.736 --> 03:11:49.639]  It's just to get into Building 7, to get into 9-11, to get into the NORAD stand down, to get into U.S.
[03:11:49.639 --> 03:12:04.829]  and British troops, mass in and around Afghanistan in the two months before, and Newsweek admitting Bush signed the attack order to go into Afghanistan on September 10th, and Jeb Bush declared martial law two days before in Florida, AP, and hijackers trained at U.S.
[03:12:04.829 --> 03:12:05.590]  bases.
[03:12:05.590 --> 03:12:06.811]  They thought they were taking part in a drill.
[03:12:08.151 --> 03:12:10.633]  Well, on and on, it's all confirmed.
[03:12:10.633 --> 03:12:36.973]  But to have another eyewitness who's a prestigious pedigree with the BBC, ITN, top correspondent in the Middle East, you know, interviewing with Shaw, Yasser Arafat, I mean, he's at the highest level of journalist, Alan Hart, blowing the whistle that day one, he was witnessing the cover-up in the media, the self-censorship, that, because people are
[03:12:37.794 --> 03:12:46.276]  It's like Albert Speer, the German interior minister, the architect, was asked later, why did you go along with Hitler?
[03:12:46.276 --> 03:12:47.156]  Why did you do all this?
[03:12:47.156 --> 03:12:53.997]  Because he was known as an intellectual and an aristocrat, and they actually let him off because the British liked him so much at Nuremberg.
[03:12:53.997 --> 03:12:59.618]  And he said, well, when the devil's got his arm around you, being nice to you, you don't, you know, recognize it's the devil.
[03:12:59.618 --> 03:13:01.618]  And he just, once you're in it, you're in it.
[03:13:01.618 --> 03:13:03.919]  Well, folks, we gotta say we're not part of this.
[03:13:03.919 --> 03:13:05.059]  The media, everybody.
[03:13:06.098 --> 03:13:10.701]  Again, I'm going to shut up and I apologize for spending some time here with this precious guest, but I just wanted to preface it.
[03:13:10.701 --> 03:13:14.544]  Alan, you don't like talking about yourself, but you've got such a lengthy bio.
[03:13:14.544 --> 03:13:18.106]  You know, it'd be like talking about Muhammad Ali's boxing career.
[03:13:18.106 --> 03:13:28.653]  You know, that would take an hour to just hit the highlights, but for those that don't know who Alan Hart is, and the website's alanhart.net, tell us about your career, what you've done, and why you're going public now.
[03:13:29.133 --> 03:13:37.928]  Well, Alex, first of all, let me say I'm delighted to become a member of your truth-telling society, if I can put it like that, and I'd like to tell you why in two sentences.
[03:13:38.797 --> 03:13:49.884]  When I became a very young reporter with Independent Television News more than 40 years ago, my editor-in-chief gave me the mission statement in one short sentence.
[03:13:49.884 --> 03:13:54.367]  Quote, our job is to help keep democracy alive.
[03:13:54.367 --> 03:13:55.868]  Unquote.
[03:13:55.868 --> 03:14:00.050]  And my take today, Alex, is quite simple.
[03:14:00.050 --> 03:14:04.193]  The mainstream media has betrayed democracy.
[03:14:04.193 --> 03:14:06.034]  I suspect you might go along with that too, yeah?
[03:14:06.633 --> 03:14:07.534]  They certainly have.
[03:14:07.534 --> 03:14:10.536]  They've been part of the complete overthrow of our society.
[03:14:10.536 --> 03:14:20.744]  Okay, well Alex, my background is I've been in journalism and I've been doing secret politics in the Middle East for the best part of 40 years.
[03:14:20.744 --> 03:14:24.387]  I have two claims to fame in a sense.
[03:14:25.229 --> 03:14:41.546]  I am the only person on earth, I think, who enjoyed intimate access to, and on the human level, friendship with, the two greatest opposites in all of human history, Golda Meir, Mother Israel, and Yasser Arafat, Father Palestine.
[03:14:42.166 --> 03:14:45.591]  I think there's nobody else on the planet who can say that.
[03:14:45.591 --> 03:14:50.777]  My other claim to fame is that you know the first rule of journalism, Alex.
[03:14:50.777 --> 03:14:57.685]  If you offend both parties to a dispute or a conflict, you're probably on the right track.
[03:14:57.685 --> 03:14:58.346]  Yes.
[03:14:58.346 --> 03:15:01.209]  Well, I am red flagged by Zionism.
[03:15:01.990 --> 03:15:08.512]  And the regimes of an impotent, corrupt, repressive Arab order.
[03:15:08.512 --> 03:15:12.273]  Both of those have red flagged me, so I guess I'm on the right track.
[03:15:12.273 --> 03:15:26.597]  So basically what I bring to the table is 40 years of experience of covering the world in general, the Middle East in particular, and I should add that I started to grow up as a person, as a young reporter in Vietnam.
[03:15:27.546 --> 03:15:38.315]  There I was watching America spending six million dollars a minute destroying two countries, North and South Vietnam, on a war it could not win and should not afford.
[03:15:38.315 --> 03:15:42.758]  It was there that I started to say to myself, what the hell is this world all about?
[03:15:42.758 --> 03:15:44.720]  Amazing.
[03:15:44.720 --> 03:15:46.481]  And again, you're being
[03:15:49.033 --> 03:15:49.173]  Yeah.
[03:16:06.391 --> 03:16:09.112]  First of all, I am not a latecomer to the truth of 9-11.
[03:16:09.112 --> 03:16:12.594]  I've been aware of the truth since a very few days after the dreadful event happened.
[03:16:12.594 --> 03:16:13.254]  But the point is this.
[03:16:26.954 --> 03:16:38.942]  When I was completing my latest book, it's an epic journey in three volumes through the lies and truth of history as it relates to the making and sustaining of the conflict in and over Palestine that became Israel.
[03:16:38.942 --> 03:16:45.786]  I censored myself on the subject of 9-11 because I didn't want to give supporters of Israel right or wrong.
[03:16:46.426 --> 03:16:47.467]  Yes, I understand.
[03:17:01.895 --> 03:17:03.756]  So, here I am in America.
[03:17:03.756 --> 03:17:10.561]  I did an interview with another talk show host that I respect, Kevin Barrett.
[03:17:10.561 --> 03:17:14.083]  He asked about 9-11, so I thought, hell, the book's out.
[03:17:14.083 --> 03:17:15.304]  The book's published.
[03:17:15.304 --> 03:17:19.186]  Volume 3 of the American edition is coming in a very few days.
[03:17:19.186 --> 03:17:22.648]  So, I decided that the time had come to end my own silence.
[03:17:22.648 --> 03:17:23.449]  And the point is this.
[03:17:24.292 --> 03:17:29.115]  What I think about 9-11, as an individual, is not important.
[03:17:29.115 --> 03:17:32.157]  It's what people that I've learned to respect think.
[03:17:32.157 --> 03:17:46.285]  Now, I have many friends in all walks of life, politics, business, you name it, and it so happens that two of my dearest friends are world-leading consultants, civil engineering consultants,
[03:17:46.963 --> 03:17:52.508]  Or one of the greatest civil engineering and project management firms in the world.
[03:17:52.508 --> 03:17:53.849]  I'm not going to name it.
[03:17:53.849 --> 03:17:56.431]  Pete, your listeners can either believe me or not.
[03:17:56.431 --> 03:18:03.697]  Because the research they did for me, studying all the films and everything else, they did for me privately.
[03:18:03.697 --> 03:18:10.303]  Well, you're a renowned journalist and award-winning, so that's standard for those who don't know to not reveal your sources.
[03:18:10.303 --> 03:18:12.145]  You don't want to throw them overboard.
[03:18:12.145 --> 03:18:14.627]  I mean, they did this in confidence, but continue.
[03:18:15.127 --> 03:18:17.008]  Okay, so here we are.
[03:18:17.008 --> 03:18:20.150]  They are truly world-leading consultants.
[03:18:20.150 --> 03:18:33.037]  And they said to me, when they studied the film footage and everything else, Alan, it is irrefutable that the Twin Towers were brought down by controlled explosions from within.
[03:18:33.894 --> 03:18:42.698]  Now, I know there are many other people that say that in America, but as a journalist, I can only go on people that I know and trust, right?
[03:18:42.698 --> 03:18:43.599]  Yes.
[03:18:43.599 --> 03:18:44.819]  So they send that to me.
[03:18:44.819 --> 03:18:53.824]  So by definition, Alex, if the buildings were brought down by controlled explosions, it is a conspiracy by absolute definition.
[03:18:53.824 --> 03:18:55.585]  So then you have to take it wider.
[03:18:56.477 --> 03:19:07.847]  Now, my speculation, and of course it is speculation, is that it probably may well have started out as an all-Muslim conspiracy.
[03:19:07.847 --> 03:19:20.238]  But the thing is, ever since Israel's foundation, its various intelligence agencies, Mossad in particular, and its directors of military intelligence have been brilliant
[03:19:21.008 --> 03:19:27.333]  And they've had agents deep inside every Arab government, every Arab military organization.
[03:19:27.333 --> 03:19:28.514]  Sir, we've got a break there.
[03:19:28.514 --> 03:19:29.095]  We've got a break.
[03:19:29.095 --> 03:19:29.815]  I apologize.
[03:19:29.815 --> 03:19:33.098]  I'm not going to cut you off for a single second when we get back.
[03:19:33.098 --> 03:19:35.020]  And we'll run through all of this.
[03:19:35.020 --> 03:19:39.443]  The King David Hotel bombing, the Levant Affair, on and on and on.
[03:19:39.443 --> 03:19:45.809]  Israel admits in Haaretz and Jerusalem Post they have fake Al Qaeda groups that stage events every time there's about to be a peace deal.
[03:19:46.470 --> 03:19:51.300]  So we'll come back and continue where you just left off.
[03:19:51.300 --> 03:19:54.407]  We're very honored to have our guest with us, Alan Hart, today.
[03:19:54.407 --> 03:19:55.188]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:02.233 --> 03:20:05.257]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:20:05.257 --> 03:20:10.584]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:20:10.584 --> 03:20:12.626]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:20:12.626 --> 03:20:17.632]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:20:17.632 --> 03:20:18.814]  How much do you want?
[03:20:18.814 --> 03:20:19.555]  When do you want it?
[03:20:19.935 --> 03:20:21.817]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:20:21.817 --> 03:20:22.878]  When will you need it?
[03:20:22.878 --> 03:20:25.101]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:20:25.101 --> 03:20:26.422]  Will there be any food?
[03:20:26.422 --> 03:20:27.964]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:20:27.964 --> 03:20:33.229]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:20:33.229 --> 03:20:36.353]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:20:36.793 --> 03:20:40.616]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:20:40.616 --> 03:20:41.856]  How much will you need?
[03:20:41.856 --> 03:20:42.757]  We don't know.
[03:20:42.757 --> 03:20:43.858]  How much do you want?
[03:20:43.858 --> 03:20:44.778]  All you can get.
[03:20:44.778 --> 03:20:45.879]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:20:45.879 --> 03:20:48.941]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:20:48.941 --> 03:20:50.702]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:20:50.702 --> 03:20:51.623]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:21:01.311 --> 03:21:04.272]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnabel from Midas Resources.
[03:21:04.272 --> 03:21:09.773]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation will be a direct result of the spending policy.
[03:21:09.773 --> 03:21:12.834]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[03:21:12.834 --> 03:21:16.055]  Are the majority of your assets tied up in the stock or bond market?
[03:21:16.055 --> 03:21:19.556]  If so, are those assets working for you or against you?
[03:21:19.556 --> 03:21:20.316]  One thing is certain.
[03:21:20.316 --> 03:21:20.716]  We're good to go!
[03:21:47.253 --> 03:21:51.560]  Call 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[03:21:51.560 --> 03:21:54.585]  You've worked hard your whole life, and I want to work hard for you.
[03:21:54.585 --> 03:21:56.087]  Call Peter Kronschnabel at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[03:22:01.514 --> 03:22:03.835]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:22:03.835 --> 03:22:06.216]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:22:06.216 --> 03:22:09.418]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:22:09.418 --> 03:22:14.540]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:22:14.540 --> 03:22:18.722]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:22:19.042 --> 03:22:21.504]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:22:21.504 --> 03:22:23.926]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:22:23.926 --> 03:22:27.188]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:22:27.188 --> 03:22:34.794]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:22:35.123 --> 03:22:40.508]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:22:40.508 --> 03:22:43.371]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:22:43.371 --> 03:22:47.055]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:22:47.055 --> 03:22:48.136]  And I got news for you.
[03:22:48.136 --> 03:22:49.477]  You're everyone else.
[03:22:49.477 --> 03:22:50.978]  Invisible Empire.

[03:23:00.754 --> 03:23:09.457]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.

[03:23:22.543 --> 03:23:25.804]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[03:23:25.964 --> 03:23:28.385]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[03:23:56.221 --> 03:24:07.329]  Alan Hart is a author, former Middle East Chief Correspondent for Independent Television News, former BBC Panorama presenter, and the list goes on and on.
[03:24:21.596 --> 03:24:25.640]  Started out his beat during the Vietnam War over there.
[03:24:25.640 --> 03:24:27.362]  Okay, this is a short segment.
[03:24:27.362 --> 03:24:28.763]  You got caught up by the break.
[03:24:28.763 --> 03:24:34.629]  Please start back over with the information you were covering concerning 9-11.
[03:24:34.629 --> 03:24:39.654]  Right, to pick up where we were, Alex, it's not impossible, and this is my speculation,
[03:24:40.294 --> 03:24:50.117]  It's not impossible that it started out as an all-Muslim plot, but even if it did, it would have been very quickly taken over by Israeli agents.
[03:24:50.117 --> 03:25:00.280]  I mean, one of the great truths of history is that from almost the moment of Israel's birth, Israeli agents, either Mossad or the directors of military intelligence,
[03:25:00.860 --> 03:25:09.745]  Penetrated every Arab government, every Arab military organization, every Arab terrorist group, whether they were terrorists or not.
[03:25:09.745 --> 03:25:15.968]  And if we time later on, ask me to tell you this particular story, the penetration of the Abu Nidal group.
[03:25:15.968 --> 03:25:20.531]  But for now, let us say, even if it started out as an all Muslim plot,
[03:25:21.906 --> 03:25:24.908]  Israeli agents inside would have got to know about it.
[03:25:24.908 --> 03:25:37.275]  And my guess is that they would have said to the bad guys in the CIA and their associates, Zionist associates and other neocon associates, hey, this plot is running.
[03:25:37.275 --> 03:25:38.816]  What do we do with it?
[03:25:38.816 --> 03:25:41.697]  And the answer would have been, we'll use it.
[03:25:41.697 --> 03:25:48.201]  Because we know in the background that Paul Wolfowitz had already spoken in his paper, The Clean Break.
[03:25:49.085 --> 03:25:52.946]  About the need for a Pearl Harbor event, right?
[03:25:52.946 --> 03:25:54.606]  Yes, the PNAC documents.
[03:25:54.606 --> 03:25:55.946]  That's right.
[03:25:55.946 --> 03:26:18.571]  So, the Zionists and the neocons, they were looking for a Pearl Harbor event to give them the pretext to go to war, not only in Iraq to get rid of Saddam Hussein, but the clean break document that the Zionists in America wrote for incoming Prime Minister Netanyahu in his first term.
[03:26:19.409 --> 03:26:26.376]  Talked about the need not only to get rid of Saddam Hussein, but to roll back Syria and eventually go for Iran.
[03:26:28.058 --> 03:26:30.039]  Which we now see happening.
[03:26:30.039 --> 03:26:39.303]  I want to continue fleshing this out from your experience and reporting for decades from the Middle East and interviewing Yasser Arafat and, you know, just countless other people.
[03:26:39.303 --> 03:26:45.545]  And as you said earlier, the founder of the modern state of Israel, who I believe you were saying you consider to be a friend.
[03:26:45.545 --> 03:26:46.326]  That is so interesting.
[03:26:46.326 --> 03:26:55.029]  I want to discuss that and it must be painful to have to, you know, talk about this and go over this because the truth is painful.
[03:26:55.029 --> 03:26:56.850]  I'm only looking for the truth.
[03:26:57.543 --> 03:27:02.676]  And a lot of the people that constantly attack Israel, in my experience, make stuff up.
[03:27:02.676 --> 03:27:03.759]  They hyperventilate.
[03:27:03.759 --> 03:27:05.162]  It's a religion of hating Israel.
[03:27:06.335 --> 03:27:06.835]  I don't know.
[03:27:28.989 --> 03:27:33.395]  That we're living in homes paid for by Israeli intelligence.
[03:27:33.395 --> 03:27:39.323]  We know Fox News even reported that hundreds of Israeli spies were arrested in and around 9-11.
[03:27:39.323 --> 03:27:40.565]  I've interviewed the sheriff.
[03:27:41.437 --> 03:27:45.318]  Who picked up the dancing Israelis, who it later turned out were Mossad.
[03:27:45.318 --> 03:27:49.100]  And we do know the moving company was a Mossad front.
[03:27:49.100 --> 03:27:51.081]  We do know they were videotaping it.
[03:27:51.081 --> 03:27:55.162]  We know Silverstein is tied in to all these groups.
[03:27:55.162 --> 03:27:58.963]  But then you've got separately Cheney in there in control of the stand-down.
[03:27:58.963 --> 03:28:01.324]  We know we have a stand-down order from two months before.
[03:28:01.324 --> 03:28:06.066]  Yeah, I called Cheney, Dr. The Real, Dr. Strange, about the incident.
[03:28:06.066 --> 03:28:08.247]  Well, then, I mean, speak to that because
[03:28:09.353 --> 03:28:14.777]  I'm always worried about anything that says it's one group or another group.
[03:28:14.777 --> 03:28:22.262]  When you point out rightly that, let me take Adam Gadon, the grandson of the ADL former head, up there putting up fake Al Qaeda videos.
[03:28:22.262 --> 03:28:26.024]  The CIA admits they're putting out fake bin Laden videos now in the Washington Post.
[03:28:26.024 --> 03:28:31.488]  I mean, that is clearly a Israeli production with Adam Gadon to menace and scare the American people.
[03:28:31.488 --> 03:28:37.152]  So as I'm all about exposing things, I've just found the British stage terror, the US stage terror,
[03:28:37.892 --> 03:28:48.599]  Uh, and so I want to speak about that because, uh, you, I mean, you're saying Israel found out about it and then said, hey, this is going on, let's piggyback, uh, or, or, or piggyback on it.
[03:28:48.599 --> 03:28:51.260]  But, but for me, it's more than just piggybacking.
[03:28:51.260 --> 03:28:55.283]  These governments at every level were involved shepherding the operation.
[03:28:55.283 --> 03:28:57.284]  But Alex, there are so many other things.
[03:28:57.284 --> 03:29:00.426]  I mean, look, for goodness sake, there has been a complete
[03:29:01.354 --> 03:29:08.421]  Cover up in this country, authorized by President Johnson, of Israel's attack on the Liberty during the 1967 war.
[03:29:08.421 --> 03:29:09.342]  Absolutely.
[03:29:09.342 --> 03:29:11.584]  We don't actually know who killed Kennedy.
[03:29:11.584 --> 03:29:14.226]  Now, in my view, Oswald didn't fire a shot.
[03:29:14.226 --> 03:29:16.729]  Oh, the evidence is overwhelming.
[03:29:17.763 --> 03:29:25.526]  So, you know, America has an incredible tradition at leadership level in suppressing the truth.
[03:29:25.526 --> 03:29:35.990]  And the question you have to ask, surely, is in whose interest is it that American citizens, the voters, be denied the truth about so much?
[03:29:35.990 --> 03:29:39.631]  So for you, it's all motive.
[03:29:39.631 --> 03:29:42.112]  You believe you're saying Israel had the most in the motive.
[03:29:42.112 --> 03:29:43.673]  Well, let's come back and talk about that.
[03:29:45.726 --> 03:29:46.547]  Okay, alright, stay there then.
[03:29:46.547 --> 03:29:51.515]  We'll get your answer on the other side.
[03:29:51.515 --> 03:29:52.937]  We're on the march.
[03:29:52.937 --> 03:29:55.460]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.460 --> 03:29:58.144]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.911 --> 03:30:03.213]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:30:03.213 --> 03:30:05.615]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:30:05.615 --> 03:30:08.817]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:30:08.817 --> 03:30:13.921]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:30:13.921 --> 03:30:18.445]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:30:18.445 --> 03:30:20.807]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:30:20.807 --> 03:30:23.689]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:30:23.689 --> 03:30:26.191]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:30:26.571 --> 03:30:34.186]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:30:34.525 --> 03:30:39.910]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:30:39.910 --> 03:30:42.772]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:30:42.772 --> 03:30:46.455]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:30:46.455 --> 03:30:47.536]  And I got news for you.
[03:30:47.536 --> 03:30:48.857]  You're everyone else.
[03:30:48.857 --> 03:30:50.358]  Invisible Empire.

[03:31:01.394 --> 03:31:04.418]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:31:04.418 --> 03:31:09.744]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:31:09.744 --> 03:31:11.787]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:31:11.787 --> 03:31:16.793]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:31:16.793 --> 03:31:17.975]  How much do you want?
[03:31:17.975 --> 03:31:18.716]  When do you want it?
[03:31:19.076 --> 03:31:20.977]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:31:20.977 --> 03:31:22.058]  When will you need it?
[03:31:22.058 --> 03:31:24.240]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:31:24.240 --> 03:31:25.581]  Will there be any food?
[03:31:25.581 --> 03:31:27.122]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:31:27.122 --> 03:31:32.386]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:31:32.386 --> 03:31:35.508]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:31:35.948 --> 03:31:39.772]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:31:39.772 --> 03:31:41.013]  How much will you need?
[03:31:41.013 --> 03:31:41.914]  We don't know.
[03:31:41.914 --> 03:31:43.015]  How much do you want?
[03:31:43.015 --> 03:31:43.936]  All you can get.
[03:31:43.936 --> 03:31:45.037]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:31:45.037 --> 03:31:48.100]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:31:48.100 --> 03:31:49.861]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:31:49.861 --> 03:31:50.782]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:32:00.512 --> 03:32:05.495]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:32:05.495 --> 03:32:06.476]  What have we got?
[03:32:06.476 --> 03:32:08.917]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:32:08.917 --> 03:32:09.938]  A republic.
[03:32:09.938 --> 03:32:12.580]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[03:32:12.580 --> 03:32:14.841]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[03:32:14.841 --> 03:32:16.862]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:32:16.862 --> 03:32:18.543]  So they think they own our land?
[03:32:18.543 --> 03:32:19.864]  They think they own our water?
[03:32:19.864 --> 03:32:20.484]  Children?
[03:32:20.484 --> 03:32:21.605]  Our education?
[03:32:21.605 --> 03:32:22.426]  Our money?
[03:32:22.426 --> 03:32:26.088]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:32:26.448 --> 03:32:31.414]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[03:32:31.414 --> 03:32:32.435]  We have the facts.
[03:32:32.435 --> 03:32:33.596]  We have the Constitution.
[03:32:33.596 --> 03:32:34.518]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[03:32:34.518 --> 03:32:35.399]  We have common law.
[03:32:35.399 --> 03:32:37.922]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:32:37.922 --> 03:32:41.706]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[03:32:41.806 --> 03:32:46.751]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[03:32:46.751 --> 03:32:48.253]  A new tool in the Info War.
[03:32:48.253 --> 03:32:49.354]  Don't tread on me.
[03:32:49.354 --> 03:32:56.221]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[03:33:15.225 --> 03:33:23.255]  This is a psychological situation we're facing.
[03:33:23.255 --> 03:33:30.184]  Once they sell you on the lie of killing Kennedy in broad daylight, with hundreds of witnesses seeing the men behind the fence shooting,
[03:33:32.066 --> 03:33:36.349]  Once you buy into that lie, now you're committed to buy into even more lies.
[03:33:36.349 --> 03:33:42.594]  Like 9-11, or WMDs in Iraq, or the White House memo, where Bush is telling Blair, we can get a U.S.
[03:33:42.594 --> 03:33:45.256]  aircraft shot down and blame it on Saddam.
[03:33:45.256 --> 03:33:47.197]  We can stage events.
[03:33:47.197 --> 03:33:50.259]  Premeditatedly lying about WMDs.
[03:33:50.259 --> 03:33:51.920]  That's a form of false flag.
[03:33:51.920 --> 03:33:56.764]  The Gulf of Tonkin now, declassified, getting us into Vietnam was staged.
[03:33:56.764 --> 03:33:58.325]  Over a million Vietnamese, 58,000 Americans, 200,000 maimed.
[03:34:02.148 --> 03:34:03.470]  We're going back to our guest here in a moment.
[03:34:03.470 --> 03:34:09.036]  Don't forget to support this radio broadcast and to get materials that will wake the public up to what we're facing.
[03:34:09.036 --> 03:34:12.901]  The public is awakening right now, but they need the hardcore info.
[03:34:12.901 --> 03:34:17.126]  Like Police State, The Rise of FEMA, my newest documentary, proving the total
[03:34:17.958 --> 03:34:20.681]  Police state grid that's being set up in the U.S.
[03:34:20.681 --> 03:34:22.303]  Everybody needs to see this.
[03:34:22.303 --> 03:34:25.346]  My 15 years of research condensed into this film.
[03:34:25.346 --> 03:34:29.751]  Invisible Empire, a new world order defined by Jason Burmess, just came out last month.
[03:34:29.751 --> 03:34:35.898]  Breaking down the globalists, their mindset, how they use terror, how they use narcotics trafficking to control things.
[03:34:36.458 --> 03:34:38.020]  Don't tread on me.
[03:34:38.020 --> 03:34:41.104]  Rise of the Republic that I'm featured in and consulted on.
[03:34:41.104 --> 03:34:44.628]  Michael Bagnerik, Richard Mack, Charles Key, R.J.
[03:34:44.628 --> 03:34:45.949]  Harris and many others.
[03:34:45.949 --> 03:34:47.191]  Taking back states' rights.
[03:34:47.191 --> 03:34:48.993]  Taking back local sovereignty.
[03:34:48.993 --> 03:34:50.674]  The republic versus the democracy.
[03:34:51.355 --> 03:34:55.538]  All in, don't tread on me, available at Infowars.com.
[03:34:55.538 --> 03:34:57.420]  You can also call toll free to get the films 888-253-3139.
[03:34:57.420 --> 03:34:57.660]  That's 888-253-3139.
[03:34:57.660 --> 03:34:59.301]  Now, going back to our guest, Alan Hart.
[03:34:59.301 --> 03:35:02.384]  Again, author, former chief correspondent for Independent Television and BBC.
[03:35:15.793 --> 03:35:18.515]  I wasn't quite saying that only Israel and Zionists had motivation.
[03:35:33.767 --> 03:35:41.573]  The network is Israel, there's Zionist supporters here, but the whole of the neocons, some are Zionist, some are not.
[03:35:41.573 --> 03:35:45.056]  Some are plain old-fashioned American-Americans like Dick Cheney.
[03:35:45.056 --> 03:35:51.160]  But also there is this alliance with the Christian fundamentalists, the so-called Christian Zionists.
[03:35:51.160 --> 03:35:59.567]  Now, I think, frankly, and I think I've never said this before publicly, I think that what that alliance actually wants
[03:36:00.436 --> 03:36:05.898]  Is a clash of civilizations, Judeo-Christian be Islamic.
[03:36:05.898 --> 03:36:10.199]  I think that's what they would really like to provoke.
[03:36:10.199 --> 03:36:14.121]  And that's why they let him build a giant mosque on the ruins of 9-11.
[03:36:14.121 --> 03:36:27.365]  That's why it turned out it was an intel op doing the Mohammed cartoons with him with a bomb on his head to, well they say they want a clash of civilizations in the PNAC documents.
[03:36:27.945 --> 03:36:32.827]  But Alex, you just used a word which I'd like to pick up on a phrase, police state.
[03:36:32.827 --> 03:36:36.208]  Now, you know we had a Prime Minister called Edward Heath?
[03:36:36.208 --> 03:36:36.609]  Yes.
[03:36:36.609 --> 03:36:37.809]  Not too long ago.
[03:36:37.809 --> 03:36:47.873]  Soon after he left office, my wife and I had lunch with him and I said, Mr Heath, what is your biggest fear for the future?
[03:36:47.873 --> 03:36:49.754]  Remember, this is a British Prime Minister.
[03:36:50.698 --> 03:36:57.124]  I thought he would talk about global poverty because he had been involved with it, as I had, but he didn't.
[03:36:57.124 --> 03:37:03.910]  He said that Britain will become the first police state in the so-called democratic world.
[03:37:03.910 --> 03:37:12.859]  Now, this is a guy who's been Prime Minister, who knows how the system works, and he's telling me that he fears Britain will become the first police state.
[03:37:12.859 --> 03:37:15.081]  No doubt you've read Alex George Orwell's 1984.
[03:37:17.006 --> 03:37:22.549]  Yes, that's what he envisioned coming to fruition in England if things weren't reversed.
[03:37:22.549 --> 03:37:24.069]  I go further, Alex.
[03:37:24.069 --> 03:37:29.032]  I think the Western world is on that road and well on it.
[03:37:29.032 --> 03:37:35.035]  You see, I don't think democracy exists anywhere in the world because for it to exist,
[03:37:35.735 --> 03:37:43.400]  Citizens, voters, have to be informed enough about issues to participate in debate and to be able to cooperate.
[03:37:43.400 --> 03:37:44.121]  No, I agree.
[03:37:44.121 --> 03:37:45.662]  It's manufactured consent.
[03:37:45.662 --> 03:37:46.863]  It's in SOC.
[03:37:46.863 --> 03:37:54.188]  They have removed the language and debased it down to such a level that you can't even have a communication with the average person.
[03:37:56.328 --> 03:38:08.998]  I would go so far as to say, in some important respects, democracy exists least of all in America because what passes for democracy is simply for sale to the highest bidders.
[03:38:08.998 --> 03:38:14.182]  It does include the Zionist lobby in association with the Christian Fund of Members.
[03:38:14.182 --> 03:38:18.405]  It does include the banks, the drugs, the military and industrial conflicts.
[03:38:18.405 --> 03:38:19.126]  We know them all.
[03:38:19.904 --> 03:38:25.485]  I mean, it seems to me that it really doesn't matter who the hell is in the White House, who the hell is in No.
[03:38:25.485 --> 03:38:27.265]  10 Downing Street in London.
[03:38:27.265 --> 03:38:32.947]  They are, to a very large extent, puppets of a very tiny minority of vested interests.
[03:38:32.947 --> 03:38:39.488]  And that's why getting the truth out to mobilize citizens to make their democracy work is so important.
[03:38:39.488 --> 03:38:40.068]  Well, you're right.
[03:38:40.068 --> 03:38:44.729]  I mean, there's really five big lobbies, and they're all interconnected, literally intermarried.
[03:38:45.613 --> 03:38:47.154]  Uh, and they all want the same thing.
[03:38:47.154 --> 03:38:50.696]  They want to keep the war on drugs going because they're shipping in the illegal drugs.
[03:38:50.696 --> 03:38:55.639]  They want to push their deadly pharmaceuticals on us and have forced inoculations.
[03:38:55.639 --> 03:38:58.161]  They want, uh, you know, more tyranny.
[03:38:58.161 --> 03:39:05.946]  Uh, the Defense Department, the private contractors are now taking over the police departments, the red light cameras, the surveillance, the iPhones, the computers.
[03:39:06.818 --> 03:39:12.382]  They are privatizing the police state and then literally absorbing the once free society.
[03:39:12.382 --> 03:39:17.486]  But I want to expand on things that you brought up here because I've studied 9-11 in depth.
[03:39:17.486 --> 03:39:20.828]  I said they were going to attack the World Trade Centers two months before it happened.
[03:39:20.828 --> 03:39:25.372]  I could see the preconditioning in the media that was taking place.
[03:39:25.372 --> 03:39:32.397]  And your research in the Middle East of how the Mossad and Shin Bet have infiltrated all these groups, that's on record.
[03:39:32.397 --> 03:39:33.297]  But it's more than that.
[03:39:33.297 --> 03:39:33.818]  We know
[03:39:34.797 --> 03:39:45.484]  According to Colonel Butler, the head of the Defense Language School, and the AP, and Newsweek, and other publications, they hide this in plain view, that many of the hijackers were trained at U.S.
[03:39:45.484 --> 03:39:53.209]  bases, and we know they were taking part in drills, infiltration drills, and believe they were government agents.
[03:39:53.209 --> 03:40:00.814]  So, you know, and we know Israelis were paying for their houses, were paying for their apartments, were giving them money.
[03:40:00.814 --> 03:40:02.755]  I mean, this has come out even on Fox News.
[03:40:03.415 --> 03:40:13.842]  So, but that goes further than the Israelis just piggybacking on a Muslim operation.
[03:40:13.842 --> 03:40:15.523]  And all I want is the truth.
[03:40:15.523 --> 03:40:17.825]  How do you have these guys trained at U.S.
[03:40:17.825 --> 03:40:19.246]  bases?
[03:40:19.246 --> 03:40:25.630]  Yeah, but I mean, one of the fascinating things about the whole unfolding drama is the film
[03:40:26.611 --> 03:40:28.732]  What I call the five dancing Israelis.
[03:40:28.732 --> 03:40:30.734]  Of course you're aware of that film.
[03:40:30.734 --> 03:40:31.494]  Yes.
[03:40:31.494 --> 03:40:40.159]  I mean you pull out and you see one of the planes going into the building and you see these five guys virtually dancing all on mobile phones.
[03:40:40.159 --> 03:40:50.665]  Now you know and I'm sure most of your listeners know that they were originally reported as being just foreigners, maybe presumed Muslims, and the FBI gave chase, didn't they?
[03:40:50.665 --> 03:40:52.086]  And they tried to avoid arrest.
[03:40:52.839 --> 03:40:57.821]  But they were eventually caught, and surprise, surprise, they all turned out to be Mossad agents.
[03:40:57.821 --> 03:41:09.524]  Now, I think it's not unreasonable to speculate that on their telephones, they may actually have been calling in the planes to the buildings.
[03:41:09.524 --> 03:41:10.324]  Yeah?
[03:41:10.324 --> 03:41:11.144]  Calling them in?
[03:41:11.144 --> 03:41:19.387]  Well, if they were GPS, it would already be a pre-planned coordinate, um... Well, that could be, but if they weren't, they may have had some kind of transponder.
[03:41:21.121 --> 03:41:23.422]  In which they were calling in the men to the target.
[03:41:23.422 --> 03:41:29.245]  But I mean, the point is, the guys were there, and they knew in advance it was going to happen.
[03:41:29.245 --> 03:41:33.928]  Well, I've talked to the sheriff, because they ran in New Jersey, and I've talked to the sheriff on air who arrested them.
[03:41:33.928 --> 03:41:36.289]  I mean, it's not... I mean, that went on.
[03:41:36.289 --> 03:41:40.711]  My only issue is, look, it's like a five-headed hydra.
[03:41:40.711 --> 03:41:43.793]  And so I'm not saying one head of the hydra isn't guilty.
[03:41:43.793 --> 03:41:48.335]  I'm just pointing out, like you did with the USS Liberty, and I did that in one of my films, Terror Storm,
[03:41:49.224 --> 03:41:54.413]  Because I interviewed the admirals who were involved, and the judge advocate generals, and I've interviewed them all.
[03:41:54.413 --> 03:41:55.354]  Most of them are dead now.
[03:41:55.354 --> 03:41:56.717]  Admiral Moore, you name it.
[03:41:56.717 --> 03:41:58.600]  I've interviewed Admiral Geist.
[03:41:59.893 --> 03:42:05.318]  And other admirals who were on the phone when McNamara said, no, the president says you can't defend the ship.
[03:42:05.318 --> 03:42:06.779]  And then they say, we don't care.
[03:42:06.779 --> 03:42:08.380]  We're still going to defend the ship.
[03:42:08.380 --> 03:42:12.123]  And then the president comes on and says, I want that GD ship going to the bottom.
[03:42:12.123 --> 03:42:16.107]  And he had taken control of the ship under national security previously and parked it there.
[03:42:16.107 --> 03:42:21.911]  So my only issue is Israel was guilty of premeditatedly doing it 100%.
[03:42:21.911 --> 03:42:27.076]  But this, this program is so big, the White House was coordinating the operation.
[03:42:27.076 --> 03:42:28.517]  So, I mean, this, this goes way back.
[03:42:29.480 --> 03:42:37.586]  Yeah, I mean, I've got a whole chapter in my latest three volume book which is titled, Zionism, the real enemy of the Jews.
[03:42:37.586 --> 03:42:54.559]  I've got a separate chapter on the whole liberty affair, and I bring it to an end by saying that what the liberty affair shows us is that there is nothing Zionism won't do to its friends as well as its enemies to get its own way.
[03:42:54.559 --> 03:42:56.341]  Well, I mean, Israel admits that
[03:42:57.006 --> 03:43:04.328]  They bombed Jews out of Iraq and out of Spain, you know, in the 40s and 50s to make them go to Israel.
[03:43:04.328 --> 03:43:16.833]  But Alex, can I just say why I think, we both are passionate for the truth, but can I just explain very shortly why the truth has to be handled with care?
[03:43:16.833 --> 03:43:20.534]  Because if it's not, it could provoke anti-Semitism.
[03:43:21.371 --> 03:43:32.566]  Now, I deal with this by saying there is one key to understanding, and all of my Jewish friends who are anti-Zionist agree with me.
[03:43:32.566 --> 03:43:39.515]  There is one key to understanding, and it's the difference between Judaism and Zionism.
[03:43:40.467 --> 03:43:42.768]  Judaism is the religion of Jews.
[03:43:42.768 --> 03:43:45.389]  Not the Jews, because not all Jews are religious.
[03:43:45.389 --> 03:43:51.952]  Like Islam, like Christianity, it has at its core a set of moral values and ethical principles.
[03:43:51.952 --> 03:43:54.253]  Zionism, as Jewish nationalism,
[03:43:55.001 --> 03:44:02.549]  It's a colonial enterprise which founded a state for some Jews, mainly by Zionist terrorism and ethnic cleansing.
[03:44:02.549 --> 03:44:04.231]  Now the point is this.
[03:44:04.231 --> 03:44:08.876]  That means that Judaism and Zionism actually are two opposites.
[03:44:08.876 --> 03:44:15.784]  Zionism conflates them so that it can accuse people like you and me, who are critical of Israel, of being anti-Semitic.
[03:44:16.224 --> 03:44:18.986]  But I'm nearly finished on this explanation.
[03:44:18.986 --> 03:44:34.295]  When you know the difference between Judaism and Zionism, you can understand, A, why it is perfectly possible to be passionately anti-Zionist, meaning anti-the colonial enterprise, without being in any way, shape, or form anti-Semitic, anti-Jew.
[03:44:34.295 --> 03:44:41.839]  More importantly, you can understand why it's wrong to blame all Jews everywhere for the crimes of the few in Israel.
[03:44:42.139 --> 03:44:45.384]  Sure, but I just want to be specific on this whole subject.
[03:44:45.384 --> 03:44:45.804]  To me...
[03:44:47.249 --> 03:44:54.495]  I don't even approach it psychologically from an issue of Jews or Germans or Chinese.
[03:44:54.495 --> 03:44:59.859]  The Chinese government does horrible atrocities and takes political dissidents' organs.
[03:44:59.859 --> 03:45:01.640]  What does that have to do with Chinese people?
[03:45:01.640 --> 03:45:04.102]  Or there's an Italian mafia.
[03:45:04.102 --> 03:45:06.344]  What does that have to do with Italians?
[03:45:06.344 --> 03:45:11.388]  Or John Wayne Gacy, the serial killer, was a wasp or a white guy.
[03:45:11.388 --> 03:45:13.689]  I mean, what does that have to do with white people?
[03:45:13.689 --> 03:45:15.671]  I mean, every major government I've studied,
[03:45:17.098 --> 03:45:20.260]  The Russians have been caught countless times staging terror attacks.
[03:45:20.260 --> 03:45:21.400]  The czars did it.
[03:45:21.400 --> 03:45:22.781]  The communists did it.
[03:45:22.781 --> 03:45:26.384]  I mean, this is just... I believe what the Founding Fathers did.
[03:45:26.384 --> 03:45:31.407]  Any big government tends towards corruption, like you said about the Arab states, highly corrupt.
[03:45:32.048 --> 03:45:35.953]  You know, the Saudi Arabians are constantly doing just unspeakably bad things.
[03:45:35.953 --> 03:45:42.123]  And so, you know, to me, the media, like you said, wants to make it about anti-Semitism.
[03:45:42.123 --> 03:45:46.910]  And we've caught the feds running all these white supremacist groups to go out and be inherently anti-Semitic.
[03:45:47.463 --> 03:45:50.925]  To then poison the water from a real debate.
[03:45:50.925 --> 03:45:52.326]  Let me put it this way.
[03:45:52.326 --> 03:46:00.772]  I think the real division on earth, the real division is not actually between rich and poor.
[03:46:00.772 --> 03:46:10.259]  I think the real division is between government and the vested interests which sort of run them and the citizen nations.
[03:46:10.259 --> 03:46:10.439]  Yes.
[03:46:12.043 --> 03:46:12.864]  Absolutely!
[03:46:12.864 --> 03:46:17.267]  That to me is the real division and that's where the real struggle is.
[03:46:17.267 --> 03:46:34.959]  And the reason why truth is so important is because it's only by truth that the citizens of nations can be empowered to make their democracy work by calling their representatives and even their presidents and prime ministers to account, right?
[03:46:35.501 --> 03:46:36.401]  Yes, sir, Alan Hart.
[03:46:36.401 --> 03:46:52.666]  The time we've got with you, though, and I'm going to have you back up soon about your amazing research and all the incredibly famous people you've interviewed, because, I mean, I love history and I want to get it from your perspective and also talk more about your three-volume book that's out, the third volume coming out soon, alanhart.net.
[03:46:52.666 --> 03:46:54.386]  Is that the best website to get out?
[03:46:54.386 --> 03:46:58.587]  Yeah, but there's also my American publisher, www.claritypress.com.
[03:47:01.235 --> 03:47:13.144]  ClarityPress.com and we'll talk about the title of the book and more before you leave us and I'm going to keep you a little bit in the next hour with Bob Chapman because this time is just exploding past us but I want to digress now.
[03:47:13.144 --> 03:47:14.285]  Regardless of
[03:47:15.200 --> 03:47:24.387]  The players involved in 9-11, and we know U.S., British, and Israeli intelligence are all merged together, so all three groups know what really happened.
[03:47:24.387 --> 03:47:26.649]  And there was a stand-down of our air defense.
[03:47:26.649 --> 03:47:28.070]  Cheney was in control of it.
[03:47:28.070 --> 03:47:30.652]  There were Israeli spies all over the place.
[03:47:30.652 --> 03:47:32.154]  That's admitted.
[03:47:32.154 --> 03:47:33.355]  This takes to high heaven.
[03:47:33.355 --> 03:47:35.176]  We know they blew the towers up.
[03:47:35.176 --> 03:47:38.639]  So let's go back to that, because I just want to have the national debate about
[03:47:40.159 --> 03:47:43.001]  What is the true story of 9-11?
[03:47:43.001 --> 03:47:46.142]  Because none of us are safe if that doesn't come out.
[03:47:46.142 --> 03:47:49.983]  And we know governments have been caught staging events in the past to get us into war.
[03:47:49.983 --> 03:47:51.324]  And we know about Operation Northwood.
[03:47:51.324 --> 03:47:55.205]  So, let's go back to the thought processes.
[03:47:55.205 --> 03:47:59.727]  You're a big independent journalist, author, top BBC on the previously.
[03:47:59.727 --> 03:48:01.047]  9-11 happens.
[03:48:01.047 --> 03:48:02.248]  What spurred you to talk?
[03:48:03.522 --> 03:48:14.330]  Well, I may tell you, when I first took the matter up with my world-leading technical consultants, I must tell you that their very first response
[03:48:30.302 --> 03:48:54.038]  Alan, it's possible that the planes did bring down the building, because although the burning fuel was not enough of itself to create the heat to melt the steel, as the fire ravaged down and down and down through the buildings, consuming everything else, it may possibly have generated enough heat.
[03:48:54.038 --> 03:48:56.160]  So that was their starting position, Alex.
[03:48:57.222 --> 03:49:17.656]  But then, when they got themselves, and I gave them all the film, and other visual evidence of what had happened, it was after their full studying of that, that these world-leading experts, who I know and I trust, said, Alan, no, our first thought was wrong.
[03:49:17.656 --> 03:49:25.562]  There is absolutely no question it was brought, the towers were brought down by controlled explosions from within.
[03:49:26.728 --> 03:49:36.814]  So, once that's established, and many of your own American experts have established that, there is just no getting away from it, Alex.
[03:49:36.814 --> 03:49:39.916]  It is a conspiracy.
[03:49:39.916 --> 03:49:42.778]  Well, the bigger issue here is all these other engineers.
[03:49:42.778 --> 03:49:49.622]  So you're there talking to them, you can see them being blown up.
[03:49:51.255 --> 03:49:55.236]  The concrete being turned to dust, the beams being ejected 600 feet.
[03:49:55.236 --> 03:49:56.997]  You know, it's clearly happening.
[03:49:56.997 --> 03:49:59.637]  Building 7, not hit by a plane.
[03:49:59.637 --> 03:50:01.878]  A classical control demolition.
[03:50:01.878 --> 03:50:17.642]  Why are these engineers, and I guess thousands have gone public now, and architects and physicists, but why aren't more of them, you know, any engineer who really looks at this knows the truth, NIST has backed out of their last six reasons that
[03:50:18.973 --> 03:50:20.055]  Alex, it's very simple.
[03:50:32.742 --> 03:50:47.832]  Why, if you look at the mainstream media, you and I, I think, would agree that it totally suppresses the truth, not only about 9-11, not only about many things, it totally suppresses the truth about the making and sustaining of conflict in the Middle East.
[03:50:47.832 --> 03:50:49.233]  Now, why does it do this?
[03:50:49.233 --> 03:50:49.853]  All right, stay there.
[03:50:49.853 --> 03:50:53.276]  We're going to come back and talk about that with our guest, Alan Hart.
[03:50:53.276 --> 03:50:53.716]  Stay with us.
[03:51:02.096 --> 03:51:03.978]  Don't answer it!
[03:51:03.978 --> 03:51:12.087]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings, knowing it may be another bill collector, it's time for you to call Zero Debt in 90 Days.

[03:51:19.895 --> 03:51:24.178]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?

[03:52:02.839 --> 03:52:05.320]  And you're subject to other police action.
[03:52:05.320 --> 03:52:06.581]  Tyranny is here.
[03:52:06.581 --> 03:52:10.383]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:52:10.383 --> 03:52:12.764]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:52:12.764 --> 03:52:18.628]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:52:18.628 --> 03:52:24.851]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:52:25.291 --> 03:52:31.272]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:52:31.272 --> 03:52:35.433]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[03:52:35.433 --> 03:52:39.734]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:52:39.734 --> 03:52:45.675]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:52:45.675 --> 03:52:49.235]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:52:49.235 --> 03:52:51.196]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:52:51.196 --> 03:52:51.636]  It's here.

[03:53:20.422 --> 03:53:26.586]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems.

[03:54:02.439 --> 03:54:03.320]  Federal agents!
[03:54:03.320 --> 03:54:06.083]  We are armed!
[03:54:06.083 --> 03:54:07.264]  Well, we know this.
[03:54:07.264 --> 03:54:11.288]  9-11's an inside job and they blew those buildings sky high.
[03:54:11.288 --> 03:54:16.953]  And all the major western governments up to their eyeballs in knowledge of it.
[03:54:17.874 --> 03:54:42.073]  And people inside government, it has the dual effect where people that are in the know get even more scared and self-censored, and the general public buys into the lie, and then they're ready to believe the next lie about WMDs or whatever's going on, but when you have all of these, you know, these four or five big lobbies, when they line up on an issue, and when it helps all of them, you better believe you're gonna see a movement.
[03:54:42.073 --> 03:54:42.874]  And, uh,
[03:54:44.159 --> 03:54:44.841]  It's just horrible.
[03:54:56.434 --> 03:55:03.177]  Are you not seeing the massive awakening where people are just sick of self-censoring, and we are seeing everybody come out of the woodwork?
[03:55:03.177 --> 03:55:04.878]  Just telling the truth now?
[03:55:04.878 --> 03:55:06.998]  And I think the system is very afraid.
[03:55:06.998 --> 03:55:10.580]  Well Alex, I think something very important is happening.
[03:55:10.580 --> 03:55:25.406]  I mean, what I'm learning on this, first of what I hope will be several trips to America, is that most Americans, most English people, most Europeans, as citizens and voters, we have one thing in common.
[03:55:26.138 --> 03:55:29.541]  We now loathe all of our politicians.
[03:55:29.541 --> 03:55:31.262]  Isn't that what we have in common?
[03:55:31.262 --> 03:55:32.203]  All the polls show it.
[03:55:32.203 --> 03:55:36.245]  For the first time in history, both parties are universally hated.
[03:55:36.245 --> 03:55:42.310]  The last time I saw a poll, I think Congress' rating was down to 21% and falling to 20%.
[03:55:42.310 --> 03:55:43.631]  Now that is very serious.
[03:55:44.582 --> 03:55:53.988]  So, maybe what we are witnessing is the beginning of a process in which people are beginning to wake up.
[03:55:53.988 --> 03:56:00.172]  But what they've got to do, Ray, is to make their feelings known and say, up with this we are not putting.
[03:56:00.172 --> 03:56:03.334]  But let me speculate to a nightmare scenario.
[03:56:03.334 --> 03:56:06.396]  In Britain, we're heading for 3 million unemployed.
[03:56:06.396 --> 03:56:12.440]  Now, it's calculated, but if we pass that, and we will, there'll be rioting on the streets.
[03:56:12.440 --> 03:56:13.161]  Look at America.
[03:56:13.881 --> 03:56:20.745]  If the economy continues to go bad, and in my view it will, your economic situation is going to go worse.
[03:56:20.745 --> 03:56:28.189]  Go into next year, the economic situation gets worse, you have a long hot summer, I believe you too will have rioting on the streets.
[03:56:28.189 --> 03:56:30.911]  The problem is, the system wants that.
[03:56:31.631 --> 03:56:36.613]  That gives the system the opportunity to bring in martial law and buy by what passes for democracy.
[03:56:36.613 --> 03:56:37.374]  That's my fear.
[03:56:37.374 --> 03:56:45.557]  Wow, Alan, and we have the IMF World Bank documents that were leaked when Siklitz, the Nobel Prize winner, left in 2002.
[03:56:45.557 --> 03:56:47.478]  The IMF calls it the IMF riot.
[03:56:47.478 --> 03:56:53.201]  You're absolutely right, and they're admittedly gearing up for it all over Europe, England, and the U.S.
[03:56:53.201 --> 03:56:57.823]  This has been a planned implosion, just like the Goldman Sachs documents show.
[03:56:58.692 --> 03:57:07.300]  Yeah, I mean, I think the truth is that almost all of our politicians loathe democracy, or what part is a democracy, and typically like to shut it down.
[03:57:07.300 --> 03:57:24.415]  Well, we've seen Obama's people, Bush, they're constantly saying, what we saw, the famous director came out, Woody Allen, just last week and said it'd be great if Obama was a dictator, we should just lock up all the people that disagree with him, and they're serious!
[03:57:25.549 --> 03:57:29.011]  But the name of the game, I think we're not disagreeing, Alex.
[03:57:29.011 --> 03:57:38.177]  The name of the game is informing people to give them the possibility, empowering them to make their democracy work before it's taken away from us.
[03:57:38.177 --> 03:57:43.961]  And I agree, but to make it work, we've got to be hardcore like you are and just tell it like it is.
[03:57:43.961 --> 03:57:50.846]  You know, you go in and you've got brain cancer and it's operable, you don't tell them they've got a sprained ankle.
[03:57:50.846 --> 03:57:51.046]  Right.
[03:57:52.020 --> 03:57:52.380]  Right.
[03:57:52.380 --> 03:57:57.323]  It comes down, Ray, to what one feels about the potential of Americans.
[03:57:57.323 --> 03:57:58.443]  And let me tell you this.
[03:57:58.443 --> 03:58:00.264]  I've said it publicly before.
[03:58:00.264 --> 03:58:03.245]  I have a love-hate relationship with America.
[03:58:03.245 --> 03:58:11.709]  On one level, I think most Americans, generally speaking, are the most misinformed, under-informed, gullible people on Earth.
[03:58:11.709 --> 03:58:12.470]  That's the bad news.
[03:58:12.990 --> 03:58:18.174]  The good news is that deep down, I think they are the most idealistic.
[03:58:18.174 --> 03:58:27.582]  And if they were properly informed and well-led, I think they could not only turn their own country around, I think they could give the world the lead it needs.
[03:58:27.582 --> 03:58:28.983]  Am I being naive for thinking that?
[03:58:28.983 --> 03:58:30.304]  No, you are spot on.
[03:58:30.304 --> 03:58:31.705]  That's why we're brainwashed.
[03:58:31.705 --> 03:58:38.651]  That's why we're dumbed down, is because they understand we've had the greatest liberty in history here, and it's a contagion to the elite.
[03:58:38.651 --> 03:58:40.573]  Back in one minute with our amazing guest.
