[00:00:04.847 --> 00:00:09.689]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:11.270]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.811]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:17.012]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.012 --> 00:00:24.016]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.016 --> 00:00:32.920]  Well, my friends, you have tuned in to an amazing transmission, completely jam-packed with unbelievable info today.
[00:00:34.088 --> 00:00:39.490]  It is, of course, Monday, the 11th day of October, 2010.
[00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:51.073]  We're going to have Jonathan Irish and his fiancÃ©e on the broadcast with the founder and head of Oathkeeper, Stuart Rhodes.
[00:00:51.073 --> 00:00:56.235]  They're gonna be popping in later in this hour, and then again, we're gonna go into overdrive into a fourth hour today.
[00:00:56.235 --> 00:00:59.356]  They'll be on during the last hour today.
[00:00:59.356 --> 00:00:59.796]  We have
[00:01:01.076 --> 00:01:13.821]  Native American leader, Russell Means, joining us to talk about the fact that he exposed Obama before he even got elected as a complete puppet of the globalist and was attacked by the left, where Mr. Means, of course, has been an icon.
[00:01:13.821 --> 00:01:15.022]  He's been proven right.
[00:01:15.022 --> 00:01:23.005]  We're going to get his take on the plunging dollar, the empire in trouble, how Native Americans had their children kidnapped by CPS.
[00:01:23.005 --> 00:01:28.748]  In fact, when they started the health departments, they were modeled after the stealing of Native American children.
[00:01:29.548 --> 00:01:35.613]  So we'll also get his take on that in the next hour when he joins us from video Skype.
[00:01:35.613 --> 00:01:43.459]  We'll be streaming that, of course, not just on the radio on the AM and FM dial, but in live living color at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:53.307]  And Dr. Doug Rocky joins us in the third hour, part two on depleted uranium and just how deadly this scourge is.
[00:01:53.307 --> 00:01:55.049]  So that is all coming up today.
[00:01:56.405 --> 00:02:15.644]  Right now on the Drudge Report, they have top links to the local newspapers in New Hampshire who have seen the full affidavit used by the court to take the Irish's newborn baby.
[00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:18.962]  And so the denial's all over.
[00:02:18.962 --> 00:02:21.564]  It's just like when we released the MIAC report.
[00:02:21.564 --> 00:02:23.105]  People for a week said it was fake.
[00:02:23.105 --> 00:02:24.726]  Or the Homeland Security reports.
[00:02:24.726 --> 00:02:26.787]  Or the Clergy Response Team documents.
[00:02:26.787 --> 00:02:27.948]  It's all real.
[00:02:27.948 --> 00:02:30.650]  People are like, well, why didn't you post the whole thing?
[00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.312]  Well, Mr. Irish told me I could, but I thought, you know what?
[00:02:33.312 --> 00:02:38.975]  I'm not going to put where they live or all their information and, you know, the other CPS allegations.
[00:02:38.975 --> 00:02:46.180]  The issue is that Oath Keepers was cited and gun ownership was cited for political demonization.
[00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.941]  That's the issue.
[00:02:48.482 --> 00:03:00.632]  Mr. Irish's landlord is in the newspaper saying he is a model tenant and that they are just nice, good, peaceful people in the year they've been living there.
[00:03:00.632 --> 00:03:01.953]  No problems.
[00:03:01.953 --> 00:03:06.077]  And then you read the affidavit, which we have the whole thing, and it's just, it's standard.
[00:03:06.077 --> 00:03:08.639]  I've been studying the CPS for 15 years.
[00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.560]  I have battled them in Austin.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.262]  I have seen them just out
[00:03:13.587 --> 00:03:14.307]  I don't know.
[00:03:40.123 --> 00:03:42.285]  And so we now have the new headline up.
[00:03:42.285 --> 00:03:46.569]  Feds treat baby snatch protesters like terrorists.
[00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:58.120]  The FBI admits to the local TV and newspapers that they called in bomb-sniffing dogs for the protests of about 10 people that was spontaneous last Friday at
[00:04:00.776 --> 00:04:02.577]  Three o'clock Eastern.
[00:04:02.577 --> 00:04:05.358]  They're in Concord, Mass at the hospital.
[00:04:05.358 --> 00:04:07.279]  And they said, well, there was no threat or no bombs.
[00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:09.000]  We just we just came out here.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.102]  Basically, again, anybody who protests the government child kidnapping operation is a terrorist.
[00:04:14.102 --> 00:04:19.745]  And now I talked to Mr. Irish, who was really upset about 30 minutes before airtime.
[00:04:19.745 --> 00:04:24.026]  And he's been told he's not allowed to have visitation with his child, even though they admit it's his child.
[00:04:24.026 --> 00:04:24.807]  And it's it's on the
[00:04:25.626 --> 00:04:25.726]  Yes.
[00:04:48.198 --> 00:04:50.101]  Off the charts.
[00:04:50.101 --> 00:04:54.847]  We've got dollar falls as currency war concerns linger.
[00:04:54.847 --> 00:04:58.112]  And we've got big Aspartame news coming up today.
[00:04:58.112 --> 00:04:58.652]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.461]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:05:05.461 --> 00:05:08.682]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:05:08.682 --> 00:05:13.483]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:05:13.483 --> 00:05:19.884]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:05:19.884 --> 00:05:22.105]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:05:22.665 --> 00:05:22.965]  Tim Geithner?
[00:05:22.965 --> 00:05:23.466]  Bernanke?
[00:05:23.466 --> 00:05:24.146]  They're arsonists!
[00:05:24.146 --> 00:05:25.427]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:05:25.427 --> 00:05:27.668]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:05:41.556 --> 00:05:45.937]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:05:45.937 --> 00:05:48.838]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:05:48.838 --> 00:05:57.940]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:05:59.941 --> 00:06:04.484]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:04.484 --> 00:06:05.405]  Number 1.
[00:06:05.405 --> 00:06:08.828]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:08.828 --> 00:06:09.688]  Number 2.
[00:06:09.688 --> 00:06:14.592]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:14.592 --> 00:06:15.332]  It's true.
[00:06:15.332 --> 00:06:20.196]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:20.196 --> 00:06:21.037]  Number 3.
[00:06:21.037 --> 00:06:24.619]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:28.322]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:28.502 --> 00:06:29.302]  Number 4.
[00:06:29.302 --> 00:06:32.063]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:32.063 --> 00:06:35.745]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:35.745 --> 00:06:36.545]  Number 5.
[00:06:36.545 --> 00:06:40.687]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:40.687 --> 00:06:45.729]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:49.910]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.892]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:07:03.892 --> 00:07:10.295]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:07:10.295 --> 00:07:17.698]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:07:17.698 --> 00:07:22.561]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:07:31.266 --> 00:07:33.547]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[00:08:05.017 --> 00:08:09.840]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.420]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:12.981]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.981 --> 00:08:17.163]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:21.246]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:28.395 --> 00:08:31.936]  It is Monday, the 11th day of October 2010.
[00:08:31.936 --> 00:08:34.697]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:34.697 --> 00:08:43.921]  Joining us in about 25 minutes, we're going to have Jonathan Irish and Stephanie Taylor, who had their babies snatched, and we have the affidavit.
[00:08:43.921 --> 00:08:45.761]  It's now in full.
[00:08:45.761 --> 00:08:47.462]  In fact, I printed that during a break.
[00:08:47.462 --> 00:08:52.363]  Can you guys run that into me and then have Nemo post it up on InfoWars.com?
[00:08:54.929 --> 00:08:57.210]  Because that is key to do that.
[00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:02.293]  We were authorized last Friday with this baby snatching case to post the whole thing.
[00:09:02.293 --> 00:09:08.717]  But I made the executive decision to only post excerpts of this for their privacy.
[00:09:08.717 --> 00:09:14.341]  And then some of the media tried to spin it and say that it wasn't even true, that Oath Keepers wasn't mentioned.
[00:09:15.455 --> 00:09:37.009]  Well, we have now gotten the authorization last night to block out all the phone numbers and names and things like that, but it has the court case number 629-2010-JV239, and to post all the affidavits, the court order, everything, where they cite
[00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:45.998]  We're going to now add this to Paul Joseph Watson's latest article, Feds Treat Baby Snatch Protestors Like Terrorists.
[00:09:45.998 --> 00:09:50.323]  We're going to talk about that coming up, and they're going to be joining us here on the show.
[00:09:50.323 --> 00:09:53.066]  But this is the type of stuff we deal with every time.
[00:09:53.066 --> 00:09:54.087]  Oh, that's made up!
[00:09:54.087 --> 00:09:55.829]  There's nothing about Oath Keepers in there.
[00:09:58.291 --> 00:09:59.771]  Oh, there's no MIAC report.
[00:09:59.771 --> 00:10:01.992]  Oh, there's no clergy response teams.
[00:10:01.992 --> 00:10:07.413]  Oh, the government's not issuing terror alerts for political gain, and then the former head of Homeland Security comes out and admits it.
[00:10:07.413 --> 00:10:16.456]  Look, we're not making any of this up, and people don't want to face the facts that people are being politically persecuted in this country for their views.
[00:10:16.456 --> 00:10:18.777]  It's that simple.
[00:10:18.777 --> 00:10:23.698]  And the update is, today we have learned that the New Hampshire DCYF is preventing Jonathan Irish
[00:10:24.853 --> 00:10:29.297]  And the baby's mother, Stephanie, they're clearly saying Mr. Irish can't from ever seeing their child at all.
[00:10:29.297 --> 00:10:32.079]  This is clearly a violation of basic visitation rights.
[00:10:32.079 --> 00:10:38.043]  Authorities cite security threats as the reason for blocking visitation without explaining what those threats are.
[00:10:38.043 --> 00:10:42.067]  And I told Watson for his update, the main issue is that he said, well, what's in the file?
[00:10:42.067 --> 00:10:43.528]  And they said, well, we don't even have a file.
[00:10:44.424 --> 00:10:51.894]  Irish and his wife Stephanie and his fiance and Oath Keepers founder Stuart Rhodes will appear on the Alex Jones Show today.
[00:10:51.894 --> 00:10:57.361]  We will also be posting the full affidavit with personal information blacked out of the letter today.
[00:10:57.361 --> 00:11:00.705]  And we now have it and it's now blacked out.
[00:11:01.285 --> 00:11:02.186]  We're good to go.
[00:11:16.937 --> 00:11:22.703]  Okay, so it's real, and the protesters that went out there had the police show up and threaten them.
[00:11:22.703 --> 00:11:23.844]  That's on video.
[00:11:23.844 --> 00:11:30.572]  And they called out the FBI with bomb-sniffing dogs, and the FBI told local TV and the newspapers there was no bomb threat.
[00:11:30.572 --> 00:11:31.452]  They just did it.
[00:11:31.452 --> 00:11:34.516]  Yeah, to imply anybody protesting is a violent terrorist.
[00:11:34.516 --> 00:11:36.998]  How dare citizens protest what's going on?
[00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.392]  So that is coming up.
[00:11:40.392 --> 00:11:43.055]  We're going to have Stuart Rhodes, Mr. Irish, and others on.
[00:11:43.055 --> 00:11:46.358]  Then Russell Means, Native American leader, is going to be joining us.
[00:11:46.358 --> 00:11:47.158]  Dr. Doug Rocky.
[00:11:47.158 --> 00:11:52.643]  And then we're going to have Jonathan Irish in the fourth hour back on for an update on everything that's unfolding.
[00:11:52.643 --> 00:11:54.905]  But this is a big national story.
[00:11:54.905 --> 00:11:57.507]  The Drudge Report is linked to it as well.
[00:11:58.428 --> 00:12:04.829]  And we're going to be covering all of that today here on the transmission.
[00:12:04.829 --> 00:12:13.091]  You notice that if you're watching on PrisonPlanet.TV, we started this segment with a document cam shot of Diet Coke.
[00:12:13.091 --> 00:12:24.774]  Diet Coke, Big League Chew, Dentine Fire, Big Red Sugar Gum, Juicy Fruit, Regular Sugar Gum, Bubbalicious, Hubba Bubba, Trident, all of it.
[00:12:24.774 --> 00:12:25.614]  Why am I doing this?
[00:12:27.972 --> 00:12:31.495]  I called Kurt Nimmo Saturday and I said, I want you to write an article about this.
[00:12:31.495 --> 00:12:34.557]  A lot of the articles you see, I basically send the guys the links.
[00:12:34.557 --> 00:12:37.039]  They do further research and add to it.
[00:12:37.039 --> 00:12:41.042]  And when I've been involved in the article, you'll see at the bottom, Alex Jones contributed to this article.
[00:12:41.042 --> 00:12:48.628]  And I told Kurt, I said, he said, well, he said, you want to do another story about Glenn Beck?
[00:12:49.878 --> 00:13:03.145]  And I said, yeah, I've got the transcript of Glenn Beck saying his doctors, this is from last Friday, are looking for toxins in his blood and that he has the symptoms of basically being poisoned.
[00:13:03.145 --> 00:13:08.608]  He said, the last 24 hours I've been thinking about doctors saying we're looking for toxins, we're looking for poisons in your body.
[00:13:11.588 --> 00:13:19.272]  And then he goes on to make the joke, I know what they are, it's studying progressives and collectivists and eugenicists and I'm being poisoned spiritually.
[00:13:19.272 --> 00:13:22.913]  So he's making either a joke or he believes in some type of voodoo.
[00:13:22.913 --> 00:13:25.674]  Meanwhile, the real poison is in plain view.
[00:13:25.674 --> 00:13:32.197]  He told the New York Times and many other publications that Mormonism forbids him from drinking coffee.
[00:13:32.197 --> 00:13:35.559]  But then he guzzles Diet Coke and even gives it to his children.
[00:13:36.789 --> 00:13:47.117]  And I talked Sunday about how I was out at a park and saw a little party of kids all drinking diet sodas, like it's something healthy their parents give them, filled with aspartame.
[00:13:47.117 --> 00:13:49.479]  And so I said, watch, Kurt.
[00:13:49.479 --> 00:13:52.421]  This story will get picked up big time.
[00:13:52.421 --> 00:14:00.127]  And regardless, millions of Glenn Beck listeners will end up reading the article, and then they'll see all the links, and they will discover
[00:14:01.089 --> 00:14:11.337]  That aspartame is deadly dangerous, and that it was known that it was deadly dangerous, and that it's not just in diet sodas now, it is in tens of thousands of products.
[00:14:11.337 --> 00:14:15.500]  Kurt's article says thousands, six thousand, that's conservative.
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:22.545]  It is tens of thousands, and now it's suddenly in almost every sugar gum.
[00:14:22.545 --> 00:14:25.327]  I mean, you go to the store, it's hard to find sugar gum.
[00:14:25.327 --> 00:14:26.728]  This is Hubba Bubba.
[00:14:29.073 --> 00:14:30.934]  Awesome original.
[00:14:30.934 --> 00:14:34.035]  And in the last two years, it's now being added to everything.
[00:14:34.035 --> 00:14:35.776]  It's every form of gum.
[00:14:35.776 --> 00:14:38.898]  It says aspartame is one of the ingredients.
[00:14:38.898 --> 00:14:40.638]  We'll try to zoom in on that, see if you can get that.
[00:14:40.638 --> 00:14:41.879]  It's tiny print.
[00:14:41.879 --> 00:14:45.561]  Here's Big League Chew.
[00:14:45.561 --> 00:14:56.266]  And it says corn syrup, natural artificial flavors, soy, aspartame, cornstarch, color red 40.
[00:14:58.919 --> 00:14:59.739]  Big League Chew.
[00:14:59.739 --> 00:15:02.040]  It's like bubblegum chewing tobacco.
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.880]  Here's Dentine Fire.
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:10.241]  This is all regular sugar gum, but it has aspartame added to it.
[00:15:10.241 --> 00:15:12.422]  So, what happened today?
[00:15:12.422 --> 00:15:16.683]  Well, we wrote the story Saturday, Kurt and I. He posted it.
[00:15:16.683 --> 00:15:23.184]  He put links to mainstream news, major universities, the federal government, even Fox News reporting on it.
[00:15:24.153 --> 00:15:26.839]  On Aspartame, linked to cancer, brain damage, all the rest of it.
[00:15:26.839 --> 00:15:28.523]  It's highly addictive.
[00:15:28.523 --> 00:15:32.972]  It breaks down into wood alcohol and, of course,
[00:15:35.011 --> 00:15:36.893]  Formaldehyde in the body, that's admitted.
[00:15:36.893 --> 00:15:41.276]  You know back during Prohibition and all the people going blind because of wood alcohol?
[00:15:41.276 --> 00:15:47.801]  They were making, you know, whiskey and moonshine with wood alcohol and people were going blind in mass.
[00:15:47.801 --> 00:15:53.566]  Well, Glenn Beck's announced he's going blind with macular dystrophy, the degeneration of the nerves in his eye.
[00:15:53.566 --> 00:15:58.931]  And so we write an article with all the mainline medical studies, literally scores of them linked,
[00:15:59.852 --> 00:16:01.514]  And we haven't completely confirmed it.
[00:16:01.514 --> 00:16:09.207]  We saw it on the message board and I got some calls about it and it's almost always accurate, but that his fill-in guest, his fill-in sidekick...
[00:16:10.612 --> 00:16:19.481]  While Glenn's off having to get all these tests and CAT scans and the rest of it, because his hands are going numb, his feet, he's losing his eyesight, and the guy reportedly made jokes about it.
[00:16:19.481 --> 00:16:25.627]  Well, look, I mean, we're linked to this in the article, and I'll give viewers of PrisonPlanet.tv a shot.
[00:16:25.627 --> 00:16:29.932]  Rat Study Shows Cancer Aspartame Link, Fox News, November 21st, 2005.
[00:16:29.932 --> 00:16:31.033]  Look, this isn't a joke, okay?
[00:16:34.363 --> 00:16:36.205]  This isn't a joke.
[00:16:36.205 --> 00:16:38.668]  And the fact that he gives it to his children isn't a joke.
[00:16:38.668 --> 00:16:40.791]  And the fact that many of you give it to your children.
[00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:50.343]  Look, when I see somebody giving their children aspartame drinks, or I see my cousin drinking a chewing sugar gum, and I go, you know, that's got aspartame.
[00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:51.144]  And he goes, no, it doesn't.
[00:16:51.144 --> 00:16:52.165]  This is sugar gum.
[00:16:52.165 --> 00:16:53.086]  I said, give me the package.
[00:16:53.991 --> 00:16:57.274]  And it was actually trident white.
[00:16:57.274 --> 00:17:02.638]  It's what he had back at Christmas when he came down to visit from Chicago and I grabbed it away from him.
[00:17:02.638 --> 00:17:06.441]  And I read on the back, I said, Aspartame.
[00:17:06.441 --> 00:17:06.861]  You see that?
[00:17:06.861 --> 00:17:08.622]  And he goes, wow, I didn't know sugar gum had it.
[00:17:08.622 --> 00:17:10.484]  And I said, look, I'm not making this stuff up.
[00:17:10.484 --> 00:17:13.086]  It's hard to find a brand that doesn't have it.
[00:17:13.086 --> 00:17:14.487]  America wakes up to this.
[00:17:14.487 --> 00:17:15.388]  People get angry.
[00:17:15.388 --> 00:17:17.609]  Mainstream news comes out and admits it's deadly.
[00:17:17.609 --> 00:17:18.830]  And what's their answer?
[00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:23.174]  We'll just put it in almost every sugar gum and even sugar candies have it now.
[00:17:23.974 --> 00:17:26.997]  Children's vitamins, sickeningly most of them.
[00:17:26.997 --> 00:17:36.604]  In fact, when I sent guys to the store, send Marley back to HEB to get children's vitamins and cold tablets.
[00:17:36.604 --> 00:17:37.665]  Just have a read on the back.
[00:17:37.665 --> 00:17:39.727]  Most of them have aspartame.
[00:17:39.727 --> 00:17:43.470]  Even pills that you don't chew has it.
[00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:47.333]  It's highly addictive and highly toxic, like many other poisons are highly addictive.
[00:17:47.333 --> 00:17:49.695]  So, the Drudge Report links to this.
[00:17:49.695 --> 00:17:53.218]  Reportedly, his fill-in host, while he is in a medical emergency,
[00:17:54.178 --> 00:17:57.701]  You know, we reach out to Glenn Beck, but people are like, why are you talking about Glenn Beck?
[00:17:57.701 --> 00:18:00.323]  Because he's been set up as the main Patriot leader.
[00:18:00.323 --> 00:18:02.344]  And we now know he's covering everything we cover.
[00:18:02.344 --> 00:18:05.847]  So what I say here now ends up on his show.
[00:18:05.847 --> 00:18:06.187]  Okay?
[00:18:06.187 --> 00:18:09.169]  What we write about ends up on the Drudge Report.
[00:18:09.169 --> 00:18:15.454]  And so whether you care about Glenn Beck or not, I've seen some sickening comments about, I hope he dies from aspartame and all the rest of this.
[00:18:15.454 --> 00:18:16.815]  No, I hope he gets better.
[00:18:16.815 --> 00:18:20.138]  I hope he gets his kids off of it before they get sick and go blind.
[00:18:20.138 --> 00:18:21.479]  And then I hope he wakes up
[00:18:22.267 --> 00:18:24.248]  Well, you're going blind, buddy.
[00:18:24.248 --> 00:18:25.909]  How do you like it?
[00:18:44.448 --> 00:18:46.591]  You talk about how you guzzle Diet Coke.
[00:18:46.591 --> 00:18:48.213]  It's not funny, Glenn.
[00:18:48.213 --> 00:18:52.859]  As you're now discovering, losing your eyesight.
[00:18:52.859 --> 00:18:54.141]  Glenn says he can hardly read.
[00:18:54.141 --> 00:18:56.083]  He says he can't even read regular type.
[00:18:56.083 --> 00:18:58.747]  He can't even read this article now without Coke bottle glasses.
[00:18:59.892 --> 00:19:01.913]  I mean, it's not funny, Glenn.
[00:19:01.913 --> 00:19:03.633]  And of course, he hasn't laughed yet.
[00:19:03.633 --> 00:19:04.874]  Reportedly, his co-host has.
[00:19:04.874 --> 00:19:08.815]  But the issue here is, this is not a joke, okay?
[00:19:08.815 --> 00:19:11.536]  This is a life-and-death situation.
[00:19:11.536 --> 00:19:14.457]  And I'm gonna show you again one of hundreds of mainstream articles.
[00:19:14.457 --> 00:19:17.718]  Here's your own Fox News, okay?
[00:19:17.718 --> 00:19:23.440]  And it says, a study in rats links the popular artificial sweetener aspartame to a wide range of cancers.
[00:19:25.726 --> 00:19:30.673]  Aspartame is found in low-calorie sweetener equal in many other sugar-free products under the brand name NutraSweet.
[00:19:30.673 --> 00:19:34.198]  It is the second best-selling non-sugar sweetener in the world.
[00:19:34.198 --> 00:19:43.290]  Researchers in Italy concluded that rats exposed to varying doses of aspartame throughout their lives developed leukemias, lymphomas, and several other cancers in a dose-dependent manner.
[00:19:46.522 --> 00:19:49.224]  Okay, now, that's only one study.
[00:19:49.224 --> 00:19:56.248]  When they tried to approve it in the 70s, it caused seizures, brain damage, blindness, and cancer in monkeys.
[00:19:56.248 --> 00:19:57.028]  Okay?
[00:19:57.028 --> 00:20:00.410]  Glenn, you're killing yourself, and so is everybody else that drinks it.
[00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:02.191]  Normal blood pressure, naturally.
[00:20:02.191 --> 00:20:03.512]  How would that make you feel?
[00:20:03.512 --> 00:20:05.233]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[00:20:05.233 --> 00:20:07.494]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[00:20:07.754 --> 00:20:15.318]  Then my real health began going downhill and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[00:20:15.318 --> 00:20:16.638]  I was a mess, pretty much.
[00:20:19.565 --> 00:20:24.868]  I started taking hardened body extract and from within a few days I started sleeping a lot better.
[00:20:24.868 --> 00:20:30.112]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[00:20:30.112 --> 00:20:35.235]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of hardened body extract.

[00:20:46.622 --> 00:20:47.703]  I did not expect this at all.

[00:22:59.011 --> 00:23:02.393]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:23:02.393 --> 00:23:06.295]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:23:06.295 --> 00:23:10.016]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:23:10.016 --> 00:23:17.500]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants.
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:17.860]  I think so.
[00:23:32.697 --> 00:23:33.357]  I think so.
[00:24:04.991 --> 00:24:10.153]  I'm going to get into the economy here in a moment, that's really the huge news, but getting back to Glenn Beck.
[00:24:10.153 --> 00:24:13.254]  Here he is last Friday's show, a transcript.
[00:24:13.254 --> 00:24:19.217]  He says, you know as listeners that I was diagnosed with macular dystrophy and I could be blind within a year.
[00:24:20.543 --> 00:24:36.788]  Well, I mean, we write an article, Drudge Report posts it with links to universities, the federal government, all the scientific reports, mainstream news articles that many people get off aspartame, and medical science admits this, and they get their eyesight back.
[00:24:36.788 --> 00:24:39.449]  It'll give you temporary blindness or reduced vision.
[00:24:39.449 --> 00:24:41.409]  If you keep doing it, you will lose your eyesight.
[00:24:44.949 --> 00:24:46.951]  Reportedly, it's funny to the guest host.
[00:24:46.951 --> 00:24:51.295]  I mean, maybe he wants Glenn to go blind so that, I mean, you know, the co-host gets the show.
[00:24:51.295 --> 00:24:54.157]  Or I guess he'll help walk him in with a cane every day.
[00:24:54.157 --> 00:24:58.301]  And here we are lovingly trying to warn, and reportedly they're making jokes about it.
[00:24:59.568 --> 00:25:01.209]  Because, see, they can't admit.
[00:25:01.209 --> 00:25:06.971]  I mean, last week, Glenn Beck's talking about how the Fabian socialists wanted to poison the water to sterilize us.
[00:25:06.971 --> 00:25:09.071]  And the White House science czars talked about it.
[00:25:09.071 --> 00:25:11.212]  But that's, you know, that's bad.
[00:25:11.212 --> 00:25:14.393]  But nobody else in industry would do something like that.
[00:25:14.393 --> 00:25:15.934]  They got aspartame approved.
[00:25:15.934 --> 00:25:18.015]  They knew it made monkeys go blind.
[00:25:18.015 --> 00:25:20.836]  And I read on the back of this Diet Coke, it says, the heart truth.
[00:25:21.667 --> 00:25:22.748]  What a sick joke.
[00:25:22.748 --> 00:25:23.509]  And here's the big issue.
[00:25:23.509 --> 00:25:25.030]  It's in almost every chewing gum now.
[00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:25.511]  Regular sugared gum.
[00:25:25.511 --> 00:25:26.232]  Regular sugared gum.
[00:25:26.232 --> 00:25:27.953]  Look at this big league chew.
[00:25:47.244 --> 00:25:49.125]  I remember eating this when I was a kid, chewing this.
[00:25:49.125 --> 00:25:49.646]  I mean, look at this.
[00:25:49.646 --> 00:25:51.307]  I'm going to dump this out on the table.
[00:25:51.307 --> 00:25:54.069]  Give me a document cam shot of that.
[00:25:54.069 --> 00:25:55.991]  Look at this.
[00:25:55.991 --> 00:25:56.911]  Look at this stuff right here.
[00:25:56.911 --> 00:25:59.273]  I'm going to dump it out on the table.
[00:25:59.273 --> 00:26:00.754]  Look at that.
[00:26:00.754 --> 00:26:04.938]  Just literally laced with aspartame.
[00:26:04.938 --> 00:26:07.139]  Cancer, going blind.
[00:26:07.139 --> 00:26:08.720]  Here, have the kids chew it.
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:12.163]  And I'm a weirdo for reading mainline science and warning you.
[00:26:12.163 --> 00:26:12.964]  I'm the bad man.
[00:26:15.214 --> 00:26:18.895]  I'm the bad person, I'm the kook, I'm the nut.
[00:26:18.895 --> 00:26:27.579]  People are going blind, they're dying, and quietly Coke and others are trying to move away to other artificial sweeteners.
[00:26:27.579 --> 00:26:39.843]  So now aspartame isn't the number one seller in diet drinks, it's number two, and they've moved on to other things that reportedly aren't as bad, still have some issues, but they still want to market for it, so let's put it in all the kids' chewing gum.
[00:26:39.843 --> 00:26:43.645]  Let's put it in adults' juicy fruit, Big Red, Extra,
[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:50.527]  Bubblicious.
[00:26:50.527 --> 00:26:51.348]  Aspartame.
[00:26:51.348 --> 00:26:52.048]  Bubblicious.
[00:26:52.048 --> 00:26:52.769]  Right here.
[00:26:52.769 --> 00:26:53.731]  Regular chewing.
[00:26:53.731 --> 00:26:55.332]  And how did I discover this a few years ago?
[00:26:55.332 --> 00:26:59.117]  My children beg in gas stations and grocery stores for some gum.
[00:26:59.117 --> 00:27:00.619]  Most of the time I can't get them gum.
[00:27:00.619 --> 00:27:02.121]  It doesn't exist now without it.
[00:27:03.988 --> 00:27:16.417]  This is something we can do to help people right now, is to get this article warning to Glenn Beck, don't drink Diet Coke, and even if he won't listen, and goes as blind as a bat, that's his issue.
[00:27:16.417 --> 00:27:21.061]  But isn't it child abuse if people know about this stuff and they give it to their children?
[00:27:21.061 --> 00:27:23.303]  Oh, but that's okay, the government doesn't care about that.
[00:27:23.803 --> 00:27:31.457]  But if you are on the Oath Keeper message board, they're going to put it in an affidavit and take your newborn baby girl because you might be dangerous.
[00:27:31.457 --> 00:27:36.325]  No judge, no jury, no due process, just a fake family court system.
[00:27:36.325 --> 00:27:36.906]  But there it is.
[00:27:38.669 --> 00:27:40.330]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:47.693]  Just like we told you a decade, over a decade ago, that they would implode the global currencies to bring out a new global currency.
[00:27:47.693 --> 00:27:50.834]  And here it is all over mainstream news today.
[00:27:50.834 --> 00:27:58.177]  Just like we told you more than a decade ago that they were packaging and bundling mortgages and taking people's houses that were paid for through fraud.
[00:27:58.177 --> 00:28:02.479]  Now they're suspending many of the foreclosures around the country.
[00:28:02.479 --> 00:28:04.440]  Five big banks have totally suspended it.
[00:28:05.241 --> 00:28:09.130]  Because it's now admitted that they've engaged in massive, complete fraud.
[00:28:10.182 --> 00:28:19.807]  But again, the average person couldn't believe us 11, 12 years ago when we had mortgage experts on to talk about this because there's no way the banks would do something that corrupt.
[00:28:19.807 --> 00:28:23.068]  There was no way sodium fluoride in water would hurt you.
[00:28:23.068 --> 00:28:25.970]  There was no way aspartame could be bad.
[00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:29.391]  Okay, Glenn Beck, just do this, and other people that are on aspartame.
[00:28:29.391 --> 00:28:31.832]  Number one, it's highly toxic and very addictive.
[00:28:31.832 --> 00:28:33.253]  That's the big secret about it.
[00:28:33.253 --> 00:28:35.714]  It's why they stack it up in their garages like addicts.
[00:28:35.714 --> 00:28:37.115]  They've always gotta have it.
[00:28:37.115 --> 00:28:38.916]  They carry big gulps.
[00:28:39.776 --> 00:28:41.978]  around with them and literally worship it.
[00:28:41.978 --> 00:28:43.680]  Glenn Beck was an alcoholic.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:47.704]  This stuff breaks down into alcohol, but wood alcohol.
[00:28:47.704 --> 00:28:50.266]  Of course you like it, Glenn Beck!
[00:28:50.266 --> 00:29:01.637]  You're an alcoholic, and you're still an alcoholic, you're still drinking, and you're giving your children a chemical that breaks down into toxic alcohol derivatives.
[00:29:02.603 --> 00:29:07.349]  Okay, I've sent you mainline news and government documents on it.
[00:29:07.349 --> 00:29:11.894]  Of course you're a lush and you don't want to stop drinking.
[00:29:11.894 --> 00:29:13.936]  But you might as well drink Jack Daniels.
[00:29:13.936 --> 00:29:15.838]  It won't make you go blind.
[00:29:15.838 --> 00:29:19.923]  Only toxic alcohol will do that.
[00:29:19.923 --> 00:29:23.267]  I guess if you drink enough regular alcohol, it'll do it.
[00:29:24.983 --> 00:29:32.669]  The point is, this is just in plain view, and it shows the denial that is systemic across society.
[00:29:32.669 --> 00:29:42.255]  Just like people couldn't believe two months ago when Bloomberg reported, even though they admitted to federal court, that Prudential and others are taking the death benefits of six million veterans as they die and not giving them their insurance.
[00:29:42.255 --> 00:29:46.198]  I mean, you understand, folks, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:29:46.198 --> 00:29:46.979]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:46.979 --> 00:29:47.479]  Stay with us.
[00:29:47.479 --> 00:29:50.681]  Economic news coming up.

[00:32:00.263 --> 00:32:06.925]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:32:06.925 --> 00:32:12.066]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:32:12.066 --> 00:32:20.789]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.

[00:32:37.727 --> 00:32:38.947]  Others don't.
[00:32:38.947 --> 00:32:41.088]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:32:41.088 --> 00:32:42.889]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[00:32:57.454 --> 00:32:58.314]  Others don't.
[00:33:05.851 --> 00:33:11.895]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:11.895 --> 00:33:14.437]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:14.437 --> 00:33:20.962]  We're going to be talking to Jonathan Irish, who had his baby daughter stolen last Thursday.
[00:33:20.962 --> 00:33:23.303]  Now a huge national news story.
[00:33:23.303 --> 00:33:25.865]  We've got Stuart Rhodes online with us as well.
[00:33:25.865 --> 00:33:31.329]  I want to remind listeners that, well, several things.
[00:33:31.329 --> 00:33:32.930]  I'm going to be live for more than 24 hours.
[00:33:34.671 --> 00:33:37.353]  Coming up this Thursday, kicking off at 11 a.m.
[00:33:37.353 --> 00:33:40.575]  Central, right through into the next show on Friday.
[00:33:40.575 --> 00:33:45.558]  Then Paul Watson will cover the last two hours of the show on Friday live.
[00:33:45.558 --> 00:33:55.145]  We're gonna have a bunch of special guests on the 24-hour plus transmission, and a bunch of never-before-seen video interviews from the films we're working on.
[00:33:55.145 --> 00:33:58.067]  I mean, I'm talking lengthy 30-minute, hour-long interviews.
[00:33:58.587 --> 00:34:01.009]  We're going to be streaming live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:34:01.009 --> 00:34:04.913]  We're going to be streaming live audio at InfoWars.com.
[00:34:04.913 --> 00:34:16.084]  We're going to attempt a test today in the fourth hour to put a free video box up on InfoWars.com so you can see what PrisonPlanet.tv viewers see.
[00:34:16.084 --> 00:34:20.949]  And we're going to attempt during the 24-hour plus marathon to have free video streaming for everybody.
[00:34:21.249 --> 00:34:25.134]  But obviously, if our bandwidth can't handle it, it'll be up for a while, then go down.
[00:34:25.134 --> 00:34:28.157]  But we're testing that today in the fourth hour.
[00:34:28.157 --> 00:34:30.320]  We'll do a fourth hour live today.
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:35.186]  Of course, the entire show is being simulcast at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:34:35.186 --> 00:34:36.487]  But for the Money Bomb Day,
[00:34:37.028 --> 00:34:37.088]  As
[00:34:56.806 --> 00:35:03.330]  Go to the site to see the new tour, the new studios, everything we're trying to complete at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:08.032]  And remember, it is your purchase of the books, the videos, the materials, the new film, What in the World Are They Spraying?
[00:35:08.032 --> 00:35:11.174]  at InfoWars.com that also makes this broadcast possible.
[00:35:11.174 --> 00:35:14.336]  Plus, those materials are vital in waking everybody up.
[00:35:14.336 --> 00:35:25.763]  Everyone that orders a t-shirt or a book or even bumper stickers or ballpoint pens that have InfoWars.com on them, you get a free citizen rule book with every order with key information about what this country's really all about.
[00:35:25.763 --> 00:35:25.903]  Now,
[00:35:27.182 --> 00:35:34.166]  I want to recap this and then go to Stuart Rhodes and then Mr. Irish.
[00:35:34.166 --> 00:35:44.933]  On Friday morning, we got the full affidavit and we were authorized to post it and I thought, man, I don't want to put their phone numbers and all their information out.
[00:35:44.933 --> 00:35:48.555]  I said, okay, there's a couple different documents, court order, affidavit.
[00:35:48.555 --> 00:35:51.697]  I said, snip this out, snip that out, just post those parts.
[00:35:51.697 --> 00:35:53.838]  And people got confused and said, is this real?
[00:35:53.838 --> 00:35:56.400]  Well, last night, Stuart got the full document.
[00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:57.980]  We already had the full document.
[00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:00.061]  He got authorization to black it out.
[00:36:00.061 --> 00:36:03.002]  And the whole thing has been posted at OathKeepers.org.
[00:36:03.002 --> 00:36:09.684]  It's also being posted in Paul Joseph Watson's latest article on this at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:36:09.684 --> 00:36:10.724]  But here's the latest.
[00:36:10.724 --> 00:36:17.406]  Feds treat baby-snatched protesters like terrorists and they told Mr. Irish today
[00:36:18.447 --> 00:36:22.253]  That he won't be allowed to see his daughter in regular visitation during this process.
[00:36:22.253 --> 00:36:25.999]  So they're basically already trying to totally end parental rights because of a security threat.
[00:36:25.999 --> 00:36:27.501]  And he said, well, let me see the file.
[00:36:27.501 --> 00:36:30.145]  And they said, we don't have a file.
[00:36:30.145 --> 00:36:31.026]  We're just doing this.
[00:36:32.285 --> 00:36:35.888]  And it's his fiancÃ©, you know, they're basically common-law married.
[00:36:35.888 --> 00:36:37.009]  It's horrible what's happening.
[00:36:37.009 --> 00:36:41.654]  They admit in the filings that he is the father, and they're saying it doesn't matter.
[00:36:41.654 --> 00:36:46.358]  And the big issue here is there's all this mud being slinged by CPS.
[00:36:46.358 --> 00:36:47.539]  I have worked these cases.
[00:36:47.539 --> 00:36:48.700]  I have exposed these for years.
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:50.441]  We've made documentaries about it.
[00:36:50.441 --> 00:36:55.005]  It is standard procedure for them to lie and to say things even worse than what's in this affidavit.
[00:36:55.686 --> 00:37:01.508]  But his landlord of a long time is on record saying he is model.
[00:37:01.508 --> 00:37:04.128]  He and his fiance are model tenants.
[00:37:04.128 --> 00:37:07.109]  Never problems, never noise, never any issues.
[00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:10.290]  The opposite of what this affidavit says.
[00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:13.051]  And the CPS can make up whatever they want about you.
[00:37:13.051 --> 00:37:21.493]  But regardless of that, it is in the affidavit that the court used to take the child that he's a gun owner, bought guns,
[00:37:22.759 --> 00:37:27.862]  Which last time I heard was legal in this country, and that he was affiliated with a quote, militia.
[00:37:27.862 --> 00:37:30.143]  As if a militia is bad, but this isn't even a militia.
[00:37:30.143 --> 00:37:30.944]  Militias aren't bad.
[00:37:31.909 --> 00:37:49.584]  But Oath Keepers, so this is political persecution, and we know that Southern Poverty Law Center is now officially part, we put the documents out Friday, Oath Keepers posted them as well, and wrote a report about it, where they are now training local police, but also medical workers, school teachers, they're setting up spies.
[00:37:49.584 --> 00:37:56.590]  And local news reported last week that ADL is, quote, training locals to identify extremists.
[00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:58.932]  And so now they're saying, we'll take your child,
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:05.623]  If you are part or a supporter of a group that says we'll support the Constitution and our oath.
[00:38:05.623 --> 00:38:08.805]  So joining us is Stuart Rhodes, then we're going to Mr. Irish.
[00:38:08.805 --> 00:38:14.988]  And because I already have guests scheduled today, Mr. Irish will be back on uninterrupted in the last 30 minutes of the fourth hour today.
[00:38:15.348 --> 00:38:27.362]  So we're going to hear from him a little bit now, but going over this information and as a constitutional lawyer from Yale, as a former staffer of Ron Paul, really has a keen mind to understand this.
[00:38:27.362 --> 00:38:30.786]  Break down exactly what we're dealing with here, Stuart Rhodes.
[00:38:31.943 --> 00:38:38.812]  Well, the big problem is, first of all, CPS is already a very low threshold of due process, as you already pointed out before.
[00:38:38.812 --> 00:38:48.224]  But to add to that, the fact that even in a criminal trial, you wouldn't be allowed to, say you were on trial for assault,
[00:38:48.644 --> 00:38:49.224]  I don't know.
[00:39:08.149 --> 00:39:13.653]  And a lot of folks are running around going, well, wait a minute, we want to know whether or not they actually did this, whether they endangered their child.
[00:39:13.653 --> 00:39:14.773]  That's not the point.
[00:39:14.773 --> 00:39:26.620]  The point is that both keeper affiliations, even gun ownership, are irrelevant to the question of whether or not they're guilty of endangerment, and they're also very prejudicial.
[00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:32.864]  But because of the low threshold of due process and CPS, it's all the easier for them to get away with doing these kinds of things.
[00:39:33.184 --> 00:40:01.321]  And so what I'm going to bring is a First Amendment claim that this is a chilling and suppression of free speech because every parent in America, if this is allowed to stand, will always have to wonder if maybe they will be put on a list and eventually in a CPS document, if they ever went in with CPS, they'll utilize their affiliations with our group or say the Tea Parties or a 9-12 group or being a Glenn Beck fan or whatever it is.
[00:40:02.101 --> 00:40:02.982]  Who knows?
[00:40:02.982 --> 00:40:14.069]  And so if you allow the politicization of CPS, what you've really done is weaponized CPS as a weapon against political opposition and political dissidence.
[00:40:14.069 --> 00:40:20.554]  And this is exactly what would happen in, say, you know, Stasi-dominated East Germany or Stalinist Russia.
[00:40:20.914 --> 00:40:21.435]  We're good to go.
[00:40:36.549 --> 00:40:47.453]  And Stuart, this is such tyranny that when we got from law enforcement the MIAC and Homeland Security reports, people couldn't believe it was real and for a week we had to prove that and now of course it's admitted.
[00:40:47.453 --> 00:40:54.655]  And people couldn't believe this, so I kind of understand why when we didn't post the whole thing for their privacy people couldn't believe it.
[00:40:54.655 --> 00:41:02.278]  Because this is just so amazing, but as you broke Friday, and we have an article up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com about this.
[00:41:03.078 --> 00:41:25.829]  Countering violent extremism working group in fact pull up that InfoWars story I believe the headline was Southern Poverty Law Center now part of Homeland Security and it goes through the Homeland Security Advisory Council and then I even have local newscast last week in Austin where I live as they are rolling out ADL Southern Poverty Law Center going into churches
[00:41:26.369 --> 00:41:35.936]  Schools, I mean, just type in the name of your town, folks, in ADL advising schools, ADL advising doctors, ADL advising psychiatrists and counselors.
[00:41:35.936 --> 00:41:42.420]  And now counselors in school are saying, our mommy and daddy don't like the government, and then they're using that as a way to take them.
[00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:46.963]  And we saw this with Barry Cooper, the former narcotics officer who quit and exposed government corruption.
[00:41:46.963 --> 00:41:54.108]  They took his son three months ago, and we showed the CPS order, and it said his father taught him not to trust the government.
[00:41:54.848 --> 00:41:57.409]  So this has been ongoing, Stewart.
[00:41:57.409 --> 00:41:59.110]  We're now just getting the documents.
[00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:01.572]  This is coming out in the open.
[00:42:01.572 --> 00:42:02.292]  That's right.
[00:42:02.292 --> 00:42:04.773]  And this is what regimes do.
[00:42:04.773 --> 00:42:10.736]  Either they create a second track of a lower due process for political opponents, or they use what's already there.
[00:42:10.736 --> 00:42:12.577]  In this case, they're using what's already there.
[00:42:12.577 --> 00:42:14.098]  It's the CPS.
[00:42:14.098 --> 00:42:19.340]  And the CPS has a low threshold of due process because supposedly you're not being charged with a crime or punished.
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:22.402]  They're mainly interested in the safety of the child.
[00:42:22.862 --> 00:42:23.543]  Well, this is also...
[00:42:37.639 --> 00:42:37.839]  This is
[00:42:55.633 --> 00:43:10.921]  And there's no proof they've done anything to this newborn baby, no proof they've done anything previous, and they go in and take the newborn baby and then cite, you're part of a pro-gun group, you're part of this Oath Keepers, and then they falsely state that you're a militia.
[00:43:10.921 --> 00:43:14.303]  And again, that's not bad to be part of a militia, but the point is they can't even get that right.
[00:43:14.303 --> 00:43:16.064]  They can't even get the birth dates right.
[00:43:16.764 --> 00:43:19.266]  Uh, of, uh, you know, the parents and people.
[00:43:19.266 --> 00:43:27.092]  I mean, it's just a shoddily written-up affidavit, and now the whole thing is up on InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and OathKeepers.org.
[00:43:27.092 --> 00:43:31.555]  I want to bring Mr. Irish in, because he's going to be with us fully 30 minutes in the last hour.
[00:43:31.555 --> 00:43:36.438]  Uh, but, uh, we also need to announce there is going to be a major demonstration.
[00:43:36.438 --> 00:43:37.259]  Is there not, Stuart?
[00:43:38.251 --> 00:43:38.711]  That's correct.
[00:43:38.711 --> 00:43:48.296]  This Thursday, the day of the hearing, 1 p.m., he can give you more details, but I believe it's Dover, Massachusetts, or Dover, New Hampshire, and he can give you the name of the court.
[00:43:48.296 --> 00:43:51.257]  But it's also on our site, OathKeeper.org.
[00:43:51.257 --> 00:43:51.857]  But 1 p.m.
[00:43:51.857 --> 00:44:07.605]  this coming Thursday, I'd like every Oath Keeper, every person who believes in the Constitution, no matter what your group is, to come out and stand there and rally for the First Amendment, rally for your right to free association and open association, and show them you're not afraid.
[00:44:08.402 --> 00:44:13.244]  Okay, let's go to Mr. Irish, because there's been big new developments.
[00:44:13.244 --> 00:44:17.986]  We appreciate you joining us and your courage to stand up against these monsters.
[00:44:17.986 --> 00:44:21.747]  Specifically, before we get into the rally, that everyone in that area must attend.
[00:44:21.747 --> 00:44:22.567]  It's so vital.
[00:44:22.567 --> 00:44:24.008]  Stand together or hang separate.
[00:44:24.608 --> 00:44:35.514]  As Benjamin Franklin said, first give us the latest developments where they're already trying to basically extrajudicially break your connection to the child.
[00:44:35.514 --> 00:44:43.059]  They're now saying for security reasons but with no bona fides that you can't see your baby.
[00:44:44.393 --> 00:44:50.777]  Correct, Alex, and thank you guys for having me on the show and giving us the chance to clear everything up.
[00:44:50.777 --> 00:45:02.923]  Well, I was actually in the shower this morning and received a telephone call on the cell phone that my mother picked up and brought directly to Stephanie.
[00:45:02.923 --> 00:45:09.607]  And Stephanie, with everything that's going on, she knows to record every phone call and tell them they are being recorded.
[00:45:10.556 --> 00:45:19.802]  And they proceeded to tell her that, well, Stephanie, we want you to come into the visitation, but Jonathan can't come in.
[00:45:19.802 --> 00:45:31.950]  And she continues to say, wait a minute, right here on the documentation on the court order, it states that the parents with an S, meaning plural, both Jonathan Irish and myself, Stephanie Taylor,
[00:45:33.183 --> 00:45:33.783]  Are you sure?
[00:45:52.535 --> 00:45:57.099]  Fiance, and they're saying security threat, and then you asked them, what's the threat?
[00:45:57.099 --> 00:45:58.760]  And they said, we don't have a file.
[00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:00.502]  But clearly, we know what this is.
[00:46:00.502 --> 00:46:03.864]  Feds treat baby snatch protesters like terrorists.
[00:46:03.864 --> 00:46:11.451]  The FBI told local TV and print news, WMUR9, that there was no bomb threat and no specific threats.
[00:46:11.451 --> 00:46:19.197]  They just sent bomb dogs in to basically imply that the little protest of 10 people were basically demons last Friday.
[00:46:19.457 --> 00:46:24.753]  I mean, Stewart, we can really see the Hitlerian demonization going on here.
[00:46:24.753 --> 00:46:25.475]  This is incredible.
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:35.285]  Well, also, as he said, this was in the court's order, so they're actually defying, if this is true, they're actually defying the court's order.
[00:46:35.285 --> 00:46:38.787]  So they're stepping out even beyond what the court's allowed them to do.
[00:46:38.787 --> 00:46:46.471]  So, yeah, I mean, it's characteristic oftentimes of a lot of these CPS workers that have kind of developed a guide complex.
[00:46:46.471 --> 00:46:49.673]  But, and it's also, as you said, it's kind of a hysteria, too.
[00:46:49.673 --> 00:46:53.415]  They're ramping up the hysteria and then feeding on it themselves.
[00:46:54.642 --> 00:46:59.264]  Now, Mr. Iris, Jonathan, continuing, I just wanted to interject those key points.
[00:46:59.264 --> 00:47:03.726]  Who specifically were you talking with when they just said, hey, pal, don't show up?
[00:47:03.726 --> 00:47:06.268]  Because I want to warn you, they're going to be after you now.
[00:47:06.268 --> 00:47:13.071]  Everywhere you go, you've got to have a video camera and witnesses because they know this is a big national issue now.
[00:47:13.071 --> 00:47:14.251]  You are in danger.
[00:47:14.251 --> 00:47:15.332]  Now, who were you talking to?
[00:47:15.332 --> 00:47:19.074]  I'm fully aware that we need to watch our backs on this.
[00:47:20.914 --> 00:47:31.539]  The first person that spoke with them was Stephanie, and she spoke with the... They now put a new social worker in charge of this case.
[00:47:31.539 --> 00:47:36.161]  Her name is Betty Keegan.
[00:47:36.161 --> 00:47:45.806]  And after I got out of the shower, I ran right over to Stephanie, and I wanted to find out if she was still on the phone, wanted to talk to her, see what had been said.
[00:47:45.806 --> 00:47:47.226]  She was off the phone at that point.
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:48:02.033]  Again, she had recorded it and I believe she had told them that they were being recorded as we tell everyone that calls from a number we do not know or a blocked number as DCYF did.
[00:48:02.033 --> 00:48:08.801]  Well, she tells me what they said about me not being able to see our daughter and Stephanie
[00:48:09.588 --> 00:48:17.292]  Elaborated and explained that the court order says that we can, that both of the parents will have supervised visitation.
[00:48:17.292 --> 00:48:21.634]  They have no right or reason to deny the court order.
[00:48:21.634 --> 00:48:36.222]  Well, I turned around and I picked up the phone, called, and now mind you, this is no more than five minutes later that after Stephanie, no more than five minutes after Stephanie got off the phone, I picked up the phone and called this CPSW worker back.
[00:48:36.222 --> 00:48:38.463]  Um, a gentleman named
[00:48:39.682 --> 00:48:56.966]  Tom O'Connell, I believe, I don't have the document in front of me, I believe it's Tom O'Connell, picks up the phone because I had asked to speak with Betsy Keegan, and they pushed me on hold for about two minutes, and then finally Tom O'Connell picks up the phone and says, can I help you?
[00:48:56.966 --> 00:48:58.926]  And the phone was being recorded.
[00:48:58.926 --> 00:49:06.988]  I said, Mr. O'Connell, I'm legally obligated to tell you that this telephone call is being recorded for my safety.
[00:49:09.111 --> 00:49:10.752]  And he says, OK.
[00:49:10.752 --> 00:49:19.378]  And I continue to say, well, sir, I understand that Stephanie just got off the phone with Betsy Keagle.
[00:49:19.378 --> 00:49:20.959]  I'm trying to contact Betsy Keagle.
[00:49:20.959 --> 00:49:24.182]  I would like to know why I'm not being put in touch with her.
[00:49:24.182 --> 00:49:25.643]  He says, oh, well, she's not available.
[00:49:25.643 --> 00:49:26.643]  She's in a visit right now.
[00:49:29.947 --> 00:49:32.189]  I said, okay, well, I need to speak with her.
[00:49:32.189 --> 00:49:33.890]  I need to speak with her now.
[00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:35.011]  Oh, well, she's busy.
[00:49:35.011 --> 00:49:35.571]  She can't do that.
[00:49:35.571 --> 00:49:40.655]  I'm like, well, she better not be in a visit with anyone else without her daughter.
[00:49:40.655 --> 00:49:43.317]  And he says, well, that's none of your business.
[00:49:43.317 --> 00:49:52.824]  And I told him, I said, so that is my business, because if you are allowing, and again, this is information you would have to speak with Stephanie to elaborate on, because it's not my place, but I told them that if
[00:49:54.517 --> 00:49:58.880]  They are allowing our daughter to visit with her parents.
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:03.382]  There is going to be a serious legal issue because of their background.
[00:50:03.382 --> 00:50:06.724]  Okay, but just to be clear here, let's bring Stewart in briefly.
[00:50:06.724 --> 00:50:08.925]  We're going to come back with both of you.
[00:50:08.925 --> 00:50:20.232]  This is a big deal with the order saying parents, and now they're just color of law saying, hey pal, you know, it sounds like they're really trying to terminate parental rights extrajudicially, Stewart.
[00:50:21.348 --> 00:50:27.190]  Well, yeah, that should comply with the court's order, and the court's order says what the judge wants to be done.
[00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:32.251]  So that's why Jonathan needs to get local, you know, local counsel as fast as he possibly can.
[00:50:32.251 --> 00:50:33.852]  So, which I think he's working on right now.
[00:50:33.852 --> 00:50:46.696]  Well, when we come back, let's talk about this overall issue of having the FBI with bomb dogs at the hospital when there was no threat, no nothing, just to create an atmosphere of hysteria and to demonize anyone that dare protest in America.
[00:50:47.679 --> 00:50:51.087]  And to have the police coming over and threatening people standing on the sidewalk.
[00:50:51.087 --> 00:50:52.209]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:50:52.209 --> 00:50:54.154]  We're going to come right back with Stuart Rhodes.
[00:50:54.154 --> 00:50:55.697]  In Jonathan Irish, I'm Alex Jones.

[00:52:04.895 --> 00:52:05.876]  What have we got?
[00:52:05.876 --> 00:52:08.318]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:52:08.318 --> 00:52:09.338]  A republic.
[00:52:09.338 --> 00:52:11.980]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:14.242]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:52:14.242 --> 00:52:16.264]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:52:16.264 --> 00:52:17.945]  So they think they own our land?
[00:52:17.945 --> 00:52:19.266]  They think they own our water?
[00:52:19.266 --> 00:52:19.867]  Children?
[00:52:19.867 --> 00:52:20.987]  Our education?
[00:52:20.987 --> 00:52:21.828]  Our money?
[00:52:21.828 --> 00:52:25.471]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:52:25.831 --> 00:52:29.535]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:52:29.535 --> 00:52:30.797]  You're being warned!
[00:52:30.797 --> 00:52:31.838]  We have the facts.
[00:52:31.838 --> 00:52:32.999]  We have the Constitution.
[00:52:32.999 --> 00:52:33.901]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:52:33.901 --> 00:52:34.782]  We have common law.
[00:52:34.782 --> 00:52:37.305]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:54:17.879 --> 00:54:28.800]  But specifically, Stuart, look at this, how they first put Oath Keepers in the affidavit, and the court ratified that by taking the child.
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:29.861]  That's confirmed, folks.
[00:54:29.861 --> 00:54:33.321]  The affidavit's up at InfoWars.com, OathKeepers.org.
[00:54:33.321 --> 00:54:34.862]  It's in all of our stories on this now.
[00:54:34.862 --> 00:54:36.142]  We've added it.
[00:54:36.142 --> 00:54:37.002]  You can read the whole thing.
[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:45.806]  And now they've got bomb-sniffing dogs there at the protest, and they said, oh, no one's made a bomb threat or anything, we're just here basically to demonize you.
[00:54:45.806 --> 00:54:55.092]  I mean, this shows this pattern of political demonization, and now they're saying you can't see your newborn daughter because of a security issue, basically saying he's dangerous.
[00:54:55.092 --> 00:54:57.314]  This is part of the ongoing frame-up, Stewart.
[00:54:58.649 --> 00:55:00.512]  Well, it's really part of the same pattern.
[00:55:00.512 --> 00:55:13.229]  And here's the key point, is that the judge, in the ex parte order to seize the child, adopted the entire affidavit as the judge's reasons for issuing the order.
[00:55:13.229 --> 00:55:15.372]  It just said, findings of fact.
[00:55:15.872 --> 00:55:16.452]  We're good to go.
[00:55:42.278 --> 00:55:43.238]  We're good to go.
[00:56:06.104 --> 00:56:11.189]  Yeah, it's a massive attempt at political terrorization to create a massive chilling effect.
[00:56:27.384 --> 00:56:31.586]  Mr. Irish has his landlord and others saying they are a model couple.
[00:56:31.586 --> 00:56:33.147]  Totally nice.
[00:56:33.147 --> 00:56:38.510]  He's very credible on the videos of him at the protests that we have posted on our websites.
[00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:40.030]  But I don't know him.
[00:56:40.030 --> 00:56:42.131]  I don't know if he's telling the truth.
[00:56:42.131 --> 00:56:43.572]  I believe he is.
[00:56:43.572 --> 00:56:47.254]  But regardless, we know the CPS's history of congenital
[00:56:47.674 --> 00:56:58.265]  Lying by design, A. And B, they're trying to change the subject with their demonization of Mr. Irish and his fiancÃ© when that's not even the issue.
[00:56:58.265 --> 00:57:02.088]  And some people are getting distracted by this disinfo.
[00:57:02.088 --> 00:57:09.236]  It's about why is Oath Keepers and militias and gun ownership listed in there as a reason to take children.
[00:57:09.236 --> 00:57:11.298]  This is precedent setting if it stands.
[00:57:12.349 --> 00:57:31.804]  Yeah, I mean, this is a problem with Constitutional law a lot of folks don't understand, is that even if a person is guilty, like Miranda for example, we get a Miranda rights trial in that case, it turns out he had raped a girl and he was convicted on the second go-around, and he served 20 years in prison, but it still didn't make it okay to course a confession out of him.
[00:57:31.804 --> 00:57:38.909]  And so even if a person turns out to be guilty of something, as you said, the key point here is that your political affiliations are not relevant.
[00:57:39.609 --> 00:57:48.135]  Yeah, that's the Soviet Union where the police were political.
[00:57:48.135 --> 00:57:52.638]  That's what a commissar and the commissariat was.
[00:57:52.638 --> 00:57:59.422]  But to be clear, Mr. Irish, I mean, on record, you have said that these CPS things are a pack of lies.
[00:57:59.422 --> 00:58:02.304]  Yes, sir.
[00:58:02.304 --> 00:58:05.146]  I mean, specifically, I mean, they can't even get birthdates right in here.
[00:58:05.956 --> 00:58:06.657]  Uh, correct.
[00:58:06.657 --> 00:58:08.358]  Right on the front page.
[00:58:08.358 --> 00:58:14.183]  They're saying that my... I'm sorry, our daughter's birth date is 11-6-2010.
[00:58:14.183 --> 00:58:19.368]  Which is November 6, 2010, and it's not even November yet.
[00:58:23.621 --> 00:58:26.503]  Yeah, I mean, well, this is what I've seen in all these CPS things.
[00:58:26.503 --> 00:58:33.607]  I've seen it where they get names wrong of the kids and use a three-year-old filing on some other family and child with a newborn to take it.
[00:58:33.607 --> 00:58:36.709]  They're just so lazy, they'll bring up just any fake thing to the judge.
[00:58:36.709 --> 00:58:38.390]  We'll be right back in one minute.
[00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.950]  Stay with us.
[00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:45.434]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.434 --> 00:58:46.434]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.404 --> 00:58:54.947]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:54.947 --> 00:58:55.868]  Number 1.
[00:58:55.868 --> 00:58:59.291]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:59.291 --> 00:59:00.151]  Number 2.
[00:59:00.151 --> 00:59:05.035]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:05.035 --> 00:59:05.775]  It's true.
[00:59:05.775 --> 00:59:10.659]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:10.659 --> 00:59:11.480]  Number 3.
[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:15.062]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:15.062 --> 00:59:18.765]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:18.965 --> 00:59:19.766]  Number 4.
[00:59:19.766 --> 00:59:22.528]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.528 --> 00:59:26.212]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:26.212 --> 00:59:26.993]  Number 5.
[00:59:26.993 --> 00:59:31.136]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:31.136 --> 00:59:35.901]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:36.181 --> 00:59:40.365]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:40.365 --> 00:59:42.147]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:42.147 --> 00:59:44.409]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:59:44.409 --> 00:59:47.011]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:59:47.011 --> 00:59:48.392]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:48.392 --> 00:59:54.218]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.287 --> 01:00:10.134]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.134 --> 01:00:11.716]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.716 --> 01:00:13.278]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.278 --> 01:00:17.464]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.464 --> 01:00:21.529]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:35.575 --> 01:00:36.535]  All right, we're back live.
[01:00:36.535 --> 01:00:39.276]  Russell Means talking about all things New World Order.
[01:00:39.276 --> 01:00:43.977]  Coming up in the next segment, Native American leader will get his take on child snatching.
[01:00:43.977 --> 01:00:50.398]  It got started in this country against, well, black people brought here by force, but then Native Americans and their quote CPS orphanages.
[01:00:50.398 --> 01:00:52.618]  Now it's being done to everyone.
[01:00:52.618 --> 01:00:57.679]  But the last five minutes we've got with both of you, we'll try to get obviously Mr. Irish is back in the last 30 minutes.
[01:00:57.679 --> 01:01:00.460]  We'll try to get Stuart back on uninterrupted with him.
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:02.181]  And tell us when they donate, say in the comments,
[01:01:23.607 --> 01:01:28.369]  This is directly for Jonathan for his defense against the charges.
[01:01:28.369 --> 01:01:29.149]  We'll take those.
[01:01:29.149 --> 01:01:31.230]  We've got to make sure you tell us what they're for.
[01:01:31.230 --> 01:01:34.511]  Otherwise, we'll think it's for Oath Keepers doing the First Amendment claim.
[01:01:34.511 --> 01:01:37.012]  I want to keep the two separate.
[01:01:37.012 --> 01:01:43.235]  Meanwhile, until we get his button up, you can donate, but make sure you say this is for the direct defense.
[01:01:43.835 --> 01:01:45.576]  Of the trial of David McCarthy.
[01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:06.425]  Um, the exact address of the court, um, again, I believe Mr. Rhodes posted that up on the site.
[01:02:06.425 --> 01:02:08.367]  I did not have that prepared in front of me.
[01:02:08.367 --> 01:02:17.035]  But the name of the court is the Rochester Family Court or the Rochester Family Division, uh, in Dover, New Hampshire.
[01:02:18.482 --> 01:02:18.862]  It is.
[01:02:18.862 --> 01:02:22.265]  I know it is on County Farm Road.
[01:02:22.265 --> 01:02:25.047]  Well, I mean, if it's not up, we'll get it up soon.
[01:02:25.047 --> 01:02:29.331]  But regardless, Thursday, New Hampshire, I know We Are Change is going.
[01:02:29.331 --> 01:02:36.317]  I know Lone Lantern and that organization and Restore the Republic is going to be there.
[01:02:36.317 --> 01:02:38.218]  Folks, don't count on others to be there.
[01:02:38.218 --> 01:02:39.579]  Stuart Rhodes is going to be there.
[01:02:39.579 --> 01:02:43.582]  You need... I want the entire Free States Project out there.
[01:02:44.883 --> 01:02:46.725]  And get past the denial.
[01:02:46.725 --> 01:02:50.168]  Three newspapers, the TV station, they say they've seen the affidavit.
[01:02:50.168 --> 01:02:51.389]  CPS showed it to them.
[01:02:51.389 --> 01:02:52.270]  It's real.
[01:02:52.270 --> 01:02:53.511]  Stop the denial.
[01:02:53.511 --> 01:02:55.052]  I mean, that's important, Stewart.
[01:02:55.052 --> 01:02:58.595]  People, just like with Mayak Report, they need to stop living in denial.
[01:02:58.595 --> 01:03:01.077]  This is admitted that they're citing Oath Keepers in here.
[01:03:02.193 --> 01:03:05.635]  This is far worse than the Mayak Report, because the Mayak Report was kind of nebulous.
[01:03:05.635 --> 01:03:06.435]  They might target you.
[01:03:06.435 --> 01:03:10.257]  This is saying they might target you and they might take your kids.
[01:03:10.257 --> 01:03:14.059]  And like I said, it's such a low threshold for proof or CPS.
[01:03:14.059 --> 01:03:19.701]  It's not the same as you having a chance at a trial, a jury trial at a criminal court.
[01:03:19.701 --> 01:03:25.604]  This is, CPS could come and take your kids on trumped-up claims, and then now you've got to fight to get them back.
[01:03:25.604 --> 01:03:26.965]  So it's very, very dangerous.
[01:03:30.657 --> 01:03:47.464]  Well this is just so important and we need everybody out there Thursday we need folks to donate at OathKeepers.org but say specifically it's for the baby of the Irish's and we just need to do this because I'm going to tell you right now Mr. Irish could be the devil and I don't believe he is.
[01:03:47.464 --> 01:03:52.526]  This is standard baloney that I'm seeing from the CPS but they say in section 7 gun owner
[01:03:53.226 --> 01:03:56.448]  Pro-Second Amendment, militia supporter, Oath Keeper supporter.
[01:03:56.448 --> 01:03:58.650]  Folks, nobody's safe if we don't stand up.
[01:03:58.650 --> 01:03:59.591]  We've got one minute left.
[01:03:59.591 --> 01:04:03.253]  We'll be talking to you guys again later in the transmission.
[01:04:03.253 --> 01:04:09.398]  But to be specific, are you going to be able to join us with Mr. Irish again at the last 30 minutes of the transmission, Stuart?
[01:04:10.185 --> 01:04:11.186]  You bet, I certainly will.
[01:04:11.186 --> 01:04:19.193]  And folks, understand that Oath Keepers will be filing a suit on behalf of all Oath Keepers and on behalf of all Americans on the First Amendment rights.
[01:04:19.193 --> 01:04:24.839]  And Jonathan, we're going to get him a good local council to help him with the actual question of getting his daughter back.
[01:04:24.839 --> 01:04:26.100]  So it's a two-part strategy.
[01:04:26.687 --> 01:04:39.734]  Yeah, so donate for the persecution, racketeering angle of this, and for the lawsuit, but also donate on the front to try to help the baby.
[01:04:39.734 --> 01:04:41.816]  And Mr. Irish, watch your back.
[01:04:41.816 --> 01:04:43.236]  Do you have a video camera?
[01:04:43.236 --> 01:04:44.277]  Yes, sir.
[01:04:44.277 --> 01:04:52.502]  Okay, I'm gonna call both of you back in two hours from now, or, yeah, let me see.
[01:04:52.502 --> 01:04:55.583]  I'm gonna call you both back in about two hours and 25 minutes, okay?
[01:04:58.083 --> 01:05:00.664]  God bless you, we'll be right back.
[01:05:00.664 --> 01:05:02.325]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:02.325 --> 01:05:05.686]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.

[01:05:52.304 --> 01:05:52.585]  Thank you!
[01:06:01.542 --> 01:06:05.566]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:06:05.566 --> 01:06:08.810]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:06:08.810 --> 01:06:13.615]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:06:13.615 --> 01:06:20.002]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:06:20.002 --> 01:06:22.245]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:06:22.745 --> 01:06:23.085]  Tim Geithner?
[01:06:23.085 --> 01:06:23.585]  Bernanke?
[01:06:23.585 --> 01:06:24.205]  They're arsonists!
[01:06:24.205 --> 01:06:24.926]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:06:24.926 --> 01:06:27.046]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:48.959]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:06:48.959 --> 01:06:58.070]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv

[01:07:03.156 --> 01:07:06.961]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[01:07:06.961 --> 01:07:09.845]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[01:07:09.845 --> 01:07:14.771]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.

[01:08:02.099 --> 01:08:08.722]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.722 --> 01:08:13.124]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:13.124 --> 01:08:23.548]  Well, you can say what you want about Russell Means, Native American leader, probably the greatest living leader out there, the most prominent movie star, I mean, you name it.
[01:08:25.812 --> 01:08:32.936]  And he's helping lead the charge for a Native American country within the United States.
[01:08:32.936 --> 01:08:35.397]  We're going to talk about that before he leaves us at the end of the hour.
[01:08:35.397 --> 01:08:42.041]  But the reason I wanted to get him on is I was watching an old YouTube video of him on like a year and a half ago when Obama first got elected.
[01:08:42.041 --> 01:08:45.563]  Even before he got elected, he said, look, the Republicans are bad, but the Democrats are the same.
[01:08:45.563 --> 01:08:46.663]  They're owned by the same people.
[01:08:46.663 --> 01:08:47.244]  It's a fraud.
[01:08:47.244 --> 01:08:48.825]  He got attacked by all these liberals.
[01:08:49.725 --> 01:08:54.326]  You know, who aren't as street smart as him, and I wanted to get him on to talk about all of this.
[01:08:54.326 --> 01:08:56.107]  But also, the empire is now imploding.
[01:08:56.107 --> 01:08:57.467]  The dollar is plunging today.
[01:08:57.467 --> 01:08:58.588]  Gold is way up again.
[01:08:58.588 --> 01:09:01.969]  We're going to be going over that with him.
[01:09:01.969 --> 01:09:14.792]  But also, I'm a student of history, so I know that concentration camps were invented by the British more than 200 years ago for India, but also for the colonies.
[01:09:14.792 --> 01:09:16.713]  And during the war, they put people like
[01:09:17.313 --> 01:09:17.333]  I
[01:09:32.873 --> 01:09:35.674]  And I read the writings of Adolf Hitler and the history.
[01:09:35.674 --> 01:09:42.415]  He modeled his camps off of the British concentration camps that were then perfected by the U.S.
[01:09:42.415 --> 01:09:46.916]  Army and the cavalry out west against Russell Means people and others.
[01:09:46.916 --> 01:09:57.979]  But now the plantation model, the police state lockdown, naked body scanning model, the CPS seizing over a million children a year model is exactly what was done with Native Americans.
[01:09:57.979 --> 01:10:00.700]  And if you study Native Americans, even tribes that submitted
[01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:01.680]  I think?
[01:10:24.753 --> 01:10:33.776]  So, what's been going on to black people, white people, everybody, is now happening to everyone.
[01:10:33.776 --> 01:10:36.757]  And we lost Russell Means with his video Skype connection.
[01:10:36.757 --> 01:10:38.017]  We're going to get him back up.
[01:10:38.017 --> 01:10:41.018]  And if we're not successful, we'll get him via telephone.
[01:10:41.018 --> 01:10:46.220]  But I wanted to get Russell Means' breakdown on all of this information.
[01:10:47.356 --> 01:10:47.636]  I don't know.
[01:11:06.733 --> 01:11:08.754]  He lost the nomination to Ron Paul since 92.
[01:11:08.754 --> 01:11:12.615]  Means has appeared in The Last of the Mohicans, Natural Born Killers, and other movies.
[01:11:12.615 --> 01:11:16.296]  He has championed the rights of indigenous peoples in other countries, as well as in the U.S.
[01:11:16.296 --> 01:11:24.338]  In a televised speech at 2000 Libertarian Party National Convention, Means said that he prefers the label Indian to more politically correct Native American.
[01:11:24.338 --> 01:11:29.080]  Everyone who was born in America is a Native American, he said.
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:33.701]  And he joins us now to talk about the state of the world, but we're obviously talking about
[01:11:34.221 --> 01:11:39.225]  Now Homeland Security saying gun owners, landowners, libertarians.
[01:11:39.225 --> 01:11:42.627]  Homeland Security now has ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, involved.
[01:11:42.627 --> 01:11:51.794]  I have the official document and they're now going to school teachers, school counselors, and trying to take people's children if they're anti-New World Order.
[01:11:51.794 --> 01:11:58.539]  And so now what was done to the Native Americans, to the Native Indians, is now being done to everybody.
[01:11:58.539 --> 01:12:00.361]  So I guess what comes around goes around.
[01:12:00.361 --> 01:12:03.483]  Sins of the fathers will come back on the grandsons and the great-grandsons.
[01:12:03.743 --> 01:12:05.884]  Mr. Means, good to have you with us.
[01:12:05.884 --> 01:12:06.904]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:12:06.904 --> 01:12:08.385]  Great to be with you again.
[01:12:08.385 --> 01:12:12.086]  What do you think of that information I just laid out?
[01:12:12.086 --> 01:12:13.627]  It's right on point.
[01:12:13.627 --> 01:12:24.971]  And I've been saying since the 1980s that America, that was my speech to the colleges, I would, I entitled it, America is becoming one huge Indian reservation.
[01:12:25.695 --> 01:12:33.920]  I changed that title in the 90s to America Has Become One Huge Indian Reservation, and it's even more so today.
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:42.165]  All policies of the United States government, both foreign and domestic, were bred and born on an Indian reservation.
[01:12:42.165 --> 01:12:49.950]  That's land policy, that's health, that's education, and of course, economic and political.
[01:12:50.996 --> 01:12:52.218]  And you're not just saying that.
[01:12:52.218 --> 01:12:54.821]  I mean, there's an entire historical fact behind that.
[01:12:54.821 --> 01:13:06.715]  This is how they learned to get people dependent through the government agents that ran the programs to, quote, give the Indians food and blankets.
[01:13:07.536 --> 01:13:13.778]  It was all designed to starve you out and kill you, and now they admit this is their global plantation model.
[01:13:13.778 --> 01:13:22.461]  That's what the carbon tax, they admit, is, is to shut off all of our energy, the equivalent of shutting off the buffalo to the Native Americans.
[01:13:22.461 --> 01:13:22.681]  Right.
[01:13:22.681 --> 01:13:27.103]  All right, we lost this Skype again.
[01:13:27.103 --> 01:13:29.204]  If it does it one more time, we're gonna get him on the telephone.
[01:13:29.204 --> 01:13:31.224]  Russell Means, again, is our guest.
[01:13:31.224 --> 01:13:35.166]  I want him to continue to flesh this out because Hitler modeled his camps.
[01:13:36.315 --> 01:13:39.359]  Off of the Indian reservations.
[01:13:39.359 --> 01:13:41.382]  That is what Adolf Hitler did.
[01:13:41.382 --> 01:13:43.084]  This is mainline history.
[01:13:43.084 --> 01:13:44.485]  Hitler was obsessed.
[01:13:45.287 --> 01:13:46.128]  We're good to go.
[01:14:09.165 --> 01:14:15.849]  But we're going to talk about Obama and the State of the Empire and a lot more with Russell Means coming up.
[01:14:15.849 --> 01:14:24.955]  Also, foreclosure freeze could undermine housing market because these mortgages are run by unscrupulous groups that are riddled with fraud.
[01:14:24.955 --> 01:14:28.997]  White House doubts need to halt all foreclosures, though it's now being discussed.
[01:14:28.997 --> 01:14:31.619]  Up to 40 states launched probes into foreclosure mess.
[01:14:31.619 --> 01:14:32.840]  It's not a mess, it's a fraud.
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:34.321]  420 banks demand one world currency.
[01:14:36.946 --> 01:14:41.331]  International finance group seeks remedy to looming exchange wars.
[01:14:41.331 --> 01:14:44.474]  Financial regulators planning worldwide rules for large firms.
[01:14:44.474 --> 01:14:48.679]  They create the crisis, offer the global government solution, Washington Post.
[01:14:48.679 --> 01:14:53.364]  Fed undaunted by uncertain prospects of more money printing.
[01:14:53.364 --> 01:14:55.326]  So now they're going to devalue the currency publicly.
[01:14:56.696 --> 01:14:57.957]  Okay, let's go back to Russell.
[01:14:57.957 --> 01:14:59.458]  Russell, we got you on the phone now.
[01:14:59.458 --> 01:15:00.239]  Please continue.
[01:15:00.239 --> 01:15:13.388]  Flesh out what you were talking about, you know, the evidence that the entire world, Fallujah, the camps, the ID cards, Iraq, this is all the model perfected on your people.
[01:15:13.388 --> 01:15:14.348]  Exactly.
[01:15:14.348 --> 01:15:22.754]  Even the death squads were first practiced on us back in 1973 on the Pine Ridge Union Reservation, where I'm calling, where you're calling me from.
[01:15:24.890 --> 01:15:27.993]  But my point is education.
[01:15:27.993 --> 01:15:29.294]  It's the living proof.
[01:15:29.294 --> 01:15:39.543]  When I grew up in California, Northern California, California was ranked number one in the nation and the nation was ranked number one in the world in education.
[01:15:39.543 --> 01:15:48.690]  Then the federal government began to take over the funding and then the curriculum of all the schools in the U.S.
[01:15:48.690 --> 01:15:49.251]  It is now
[01:15:51.203 --> 01:15:53.324]  California is no longer number one.
[01:15:53.324 --> 01:15:56.705]  It's number 43 in the nation.
[01:15:56.705 --> 01:16:07.709]  And we have slipped in the last, within the last 15 years, from 17th as a nation, 17th in education, to 22nd.
[01:16:07.709 --> 01:16:12.971]  And so it's almost complete now that the federal government has been brainwashing
[01:16:16.325 --> 01:16:22.428]  We've been brainwashing our children for decades, and it's all taken from the reservation system.
[01:16:22.428 --> 01:16:34.015]  The stealing of kids, that is one of the most horrific examples of what the federal government has been doing, not only to us, but now to the American children.
[01:16:34.015 --> 01:16:37.237]  It's blasphemous.
[01:16:37.237 --> 01:16:43.360]  The jailing of young America, ostensibly to fight the drug war, and yet
[01:16:45.583 --> 01:16:53.408]  The incarceration, we have more bodies, more people in prison than all of China.
[01:16:53.408 --> 01:16:56.390]  And China has a couple billion people.
[01:16:56.390 --> 01:17:00.012]  And yet it's supposed to be a communist horror place.
[01:17:00.012 --> 01:17:03.994]  And yet America has more people in prison than China.
[01:17:03.994 --> 01:17:04.915]  That's absurd.
[01:17:04.915 --> 01:17:06.896]  That's absolutely absurd.
[01:17:07.366 --> 01:17:19.933]  Well, that's like shipping in whiskey for the Indians, and then when they get rowdy, using it as an excuse to shoot them, the government's on record shipping in almost all the narcotics, and then when they catch you with it, you go to one of their slave camps.
[01:17:21.357 --> 01:17:23.318]  Exactly, and it is a slave camp.
[01:17:23.318 --> 01:17:24.599]  It's unbelievable.
[01:17:24.599 --> 01:17:28.462]  You know, my son, I have a son that was in prison.
[01:17:28.462 --> 01:17:34.867]  They wouldn't parole him because he was ramrodding the building of homes.
[01:17:34.867 --> 01:17:38.689]  They called them Janko homes because he was the governor at the time.
[01:17:38.689 --> 01:17:43.773]  But they were building homes with prison labor, $1.50 a day.
[01:17:46.156 --> 01:17:50.299]  And they wouldn't let him out on parole because he was the supervisor.
[01:17:50.299 --> 01:17:55.964]  He was so accomplished that he was more valuable in prison than out.
[01:17:55.964 --> 01:17:59.947]  And then the general public, like idiots, say, good, make those criminals work.
[01:17:59.947 --> 01:18:06.052]  When you're working for 25 cents or even $1.50 an hour, no one can compete with that, not even the illegal aliens.
[01:18:06.052 --> 01:18:08.474]  And so the economy further implodes.
[01:18:09.557 --> 01:18:13.730]  Exactly, and Colorado has become such a prison state.
[01:18:13.730 --> 01:18:16.238]  You know, they make all, nothing but office furniture there.
[01:18:17.037 --> 01:18:24.884]  So there's no business at all in Colorado or the surrounding states making business furniture, for instance.
[01:18:24.884 --> 01:18:28.167]  So it cut out that industry.
[01:18:28.167 --> 01:18:43.921]  We definitely have slave labor going on in this country, and it's unconscionable that the American people don't do anything about all of what the Indian policies have been visited upon on their backs and on their children.
[01:18:45.236 --> 01:18:59.821]  What's interesting is, either way you slice it, it's an Indian policy, because from my study, before they kicked it off in a scientific way against Native Americans in North America, this was first developed in India, which are really the Indians.
[01:18:59.821 --> 01:19:01.301]  Exactly.
[01:19:01.301 --> 01:19:07.163]  But the payoff now comes, and I can't believe the name-callers.
[01:19:07.163 --> 01:19:13.465]  You know, I call the Republican Party nothing but name-callers, and I call the
[01:19:14.716 --> 01:19:25.861]  The Democrats are brain dead because they don't know what they are and they don't try to do anything except rubber stamp whatever the bosses say.
[01:19:25.861 --> 01:19:29.902]  But now they've announced they're going to print more money.
[01:19:29.902 --> 01:19:30.723]  Can you believe that?
[01:19:30.723 --> 01:19:33.924]  The Fed is going to print more money.
[01:19:35.037 --> 01:19:40.602]  When they're the only ones buying the financial instruments that the United States produces.
[01:19:40.602 --> 01:19:42.984]  The bonds and the treasury notes.
[01:19:42.984 --> 01:19:51.111]  Because no one in the world wants anything that is of no value and the dollar is of no value.
[01:19:51.111 --> 01:19:58.357]  It's unbelievable how America is keeping their head, you know, the classic ostrich approach.
[01:19:58.357 --> 01:20:01.600]  Yeah, they should get rid of the American eagle as the symbol and have it be the ostrich.
[01:20:02.227 --> 01:20:03.108]  Exactly.
[01:20:03.108 --> 01:20:04.630]  That's what it's become.
[01:20:04.630 --> 01:20:05.691]  Great point.
[01:20:05.691 --> 01:20:07.412]  I'm going to start using that.
[01:20:07.412 --> 01:20:10.776]  The eagle has become the ostrich.
[01:20:10.776 --> 01:20:12.758]  The American eagle.
[01:20:12.758 --> 01:20:15.041]  It's sick.
[01:20:15.041 --> 01:20:21.968]  You know, I'm wearing a t-shirt that says if voting could change anything, it would be illegal.
[01:20:24.398 --> 01:20:28.099]  And that's what really bothers me about the Tea Party movement.
[01:20:28.099 --> 01:20:29.860]  And when it first started, it was great.
[01:20:29.860 --> 01:20:34.161]  It's all about the Constitution and constitutional law.
[01:20:34.161 --> 01:20:35.882]  And let's get back to that.
[01:20:35.882 --> 01:20:41.264]  And then they start feeding in the crazies, you know, to make them look.
[01:20:42.199 --> 01:20:44.623]  Like it's a fringe outfit.
[01:20:44.623 --> 01:20:45.584]  And they accomplished it.
[01:20:45.584 --> 01:20:46.405]  Well, they've been caught.
[01:20:46.405 --> 01:20:47.006]  They've been caught.
[01:20:47.006 --> 01:20:53.235]  Going back to this asinine liberty inhibiting and preventing two-party system.
[01:20:53.235 --> 01:20:57.542]  It's impossible to have individual liberty with a two-party system.
[01:20:59.665 --> 01:21:10.551]  It's amazing, and they have been caught infiltrating the Tea Parties with people to say racist things and do things, and they've labeled the Tea Party as the only resistance to the New World Order.
[01:21:10.551 --> 01:21:16.454]  Then they hand it over to the Republicans so they can pose as anti-establishment and get right back into power.
[01:21:16.454 --> 01:21:20.296]  But now, the whole country is sinking into a global depression.
[01:21:20.296 --> 01:21:24.659]  They're announcing the One World Government, run by the banks that are the authors of this collapse.
[01:21:25.759 --> 01:21:28.482]  I mean, this empire is long in the tooth.
[01:21:28.482 --> 01:21:30.964]  What do you see happening, Russell Means?
[01:21:30.964 --> 01:21:43.054]  Well, I see the United States of America, with only its military power, trying to hang on to some kind of international influence.
[01:21:43.054 --> 01:21:53.102]  But when Israel thumbs their nose at anything the United States wants or desires or asks for, they just thumb their
[01:21:54.247 --> 01:21:55.347]  No.
[01:21:55.347 --> 01:22:00.909]  Europe, Russia, you go on down on China has switched over to the Euro.
[01:22:00.909 --> 01:22:09.131]  Brazil's Real has now become the currency to buy.
[01:22:09.131 --> 01:22:11.931]  It's backed by something solid.
[01:22:11.931 --> 01:22:16.552]  The United States is just backed by paper, worthless paper.
[01:22:16.552 --> 01:22:17.713]  It's unconscionable.
[01:22:19.568 --> 01:22:25.710]  The entire machinations of the ruling class of America is so obvious.
[01:22:25.710 --> 01:22:36.534]  It's so obvious that anybody with a brain, I can't understand what's in the food that is making American people so stupid and the laughing stock of the world.
[01:22:36.534 --> 01:22:48.498]  Well, Russell, since you raised that, I have Children's Flintstones, pediatrician's number one choice, and it says right here on the container,
[01:22:49.522 --> 01:22:51.603]  That it has aspartame.
[01:22:51.603 --> 01:22:53.404]  Oh my God.
[01:22:53.404 --> 01:23:02.128]  And then here is an allergy medicine, Alvert, and it's got aspartame in it.
[01:23:02.128 --> 01:23:11.232]  And then all the major sugar gums for children now, Hubba Bubba, Big League Chew, all of them now have aspartame.
[01:23:11.232 --> 01:23:15.774]  And I have all the government's own reports admitting it gives you cancer and makes you go blind.
[01:23:16.494 --> 01:23:23.598]  And Glenn Beck's going blind and admits he drinks Diet Coke, but I guess it's funny, he's just gonna laugh about it and go blind.
[01:23:23.598 --> 01:23:38.306]  It's amazing how this, uh, the American people have allowed the government to treat the end result of drug-induced illnesses by the pharmaceutical corporations.
[01:23:39.503 --> 01:23:41.964]  And they allow that to continue.
[01:23:41.964 --> 01:23:45.266]  You know, they're building dialysis centers.
[01:23:45.266 --> 01:23:53.030]  They're putting more drugs to take care of the drugs that have already got you addicted and sick and ill and that kill you.
[01:23:53.030 --> 01:24:00.314]  So they produce more drugs so that you can die faster and die in more pain.
[01:24:00.314 --> 01:24:06.137]  It's unbelievable how the American people have allowed themselves to be so duped.
[01:24:06.550 --> 01:24:29.489]  Well, you know, from the 1730s, there are, and anybody can Google this and pull up the university websites, there are the British colonel ordering them to take infected smallpox blankets and then give it to the Native Americans, to the Indians, and, you know, let's give the tainted wood alcohol whiskey to them, ha ha, you know, look at that engine go blind.
[01:24:29.489 --> 01:24:32.412]  Well, now the globalists just do it to everybody, Russell.
[01:24:32.412 --> 01:24:32.592]  Right.
[01:24:33.473 --> 01:24:38.736]  And if they don't do it to you, then they imprison you for slave labor.
[01:24:38.736 --> 01:24:50.041]  If you won't take their drug-induced sicknesses, they'll put you in prison or impoverish you.
[01:24:50.041 --> 01:24:53.102]  We don't have a middle class anymore.
[01:24:53.102 --> 01:24:56.484]  And those that think there still is a middle class are
[01:24:58.359 --> 01:25:06.573]  You know, by January or February, the dollar is going to be worth about, I think the euro is $1.40 now.
[01:25:06.573 --> 01:25:07.876]  It's going to be about $4.
[01:25:10.151 --> 01:25:14.455]  And the Federal Reserve is selling it as if it's a good thing.
[01:25:14.455 --> 01:25:16.476]  We're going to fix the debt by inflating.
[01:25:16.476 --> 01:25:18.058]  Was it good for Argentina?
[01:25:18.058 --> 01:25:21.040]  Was it good for Zimbabwe, Weimar Republic, Germany, Russell?
[01:25:33.812 --> 01:25:34.332]  Exactly.
[01:25:34.332 --> 01:25:43.036]  All those platitudes about history repeating itself, America is the proof.
[01:25:43.036 --> 01:25:50.180]  It just goes over and over and over again, and the American people are acting.
[01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:52.701]  Look at this coming November election.
[01:25:52.701 --> 01:25:55.462]  What's going to change?
[01:25:55.462 --> 01:25:57.043]  Nothing.
[01:25:57.043 --> 01:26:01.305]  It's unbelievable that people are even believing the Republicans because Obama
[01:26:03.015 --> 01:26:04.616]  It's worse than Bush.
[01:26:04.616 --> 01:26:08.799]  He's continued Bush's policies and added more to himself.
[01:26:08.799 --> 01:26:18.865]  Not one presidential directive that Bush has laid out has been changed by Obama, and he's added more.
[01:26:18.865 --> 01:26:23.727]  And now he's directed the U.S.
[01:26:23.727 --> 01:26:27.630]  government to kill anybody that they say is a terrorist.
[01:26:29.704 --> 01:26:45.434]  Well, they're also rolling out the naked body scanners on the streets, the courthouses, the airports, and they admit, even the New York Times admits, it gives you cancer, and it gives the operators cancer, and they have 500 mobile trucks, 10 times more powerful than a chest x-ray, looking through our walls.
[01:26:45.434 --> 01:26:46.855]  This is 1984.
[01:26:46.855 --> 01:26:52.279]  This is psychopaths running the country.
[01:26:52.279 --> 01:26:54.300]  Yes, it is totally.
[01:26:55.009 --> 01:26:56.010]  Totally 1984.
[01:26:56.010 --> 01:26:59.312]  You know, there's an interesting sidebar to that.
[01:26:59.312 --> 01:27:11.180]  You know, Orwell, when TV came out back in the 40s, he wrote the book and he said 1948, and he labeled it 1948.
[01:27:11.180 --> 01:27:18.465]  And it was a factual thing that was going to happen based upon the advent of TV.
[01:27:18.465 --> 01:27:21.247]  His publisher said, look, this book isn't going to sell.
[01:27:22.029 --> 01:27:23.090]  And that's a true story.
[01:27:23.090 --> 01:27:26.892]  And of course, he was a member of the Imperial Police in India.
[01:27:26.892 --> 01:27:30.555]  What we were talking about developed for
[01:27:43.297 --> 01:27:51.403]  Indians in the US, then he was a communist and thought that was the solution, then he found out it was run by the same people, then he worked for OSS.
[01:27:51.403 --> 01:27:53.044]  That's why his book was so accurate.
[01:27:53.044 --> 01:27:55.026]  He worked for them.
[01:27:55.026 --> 01:27:56.487]  Right.
[01:27:56.487 --> 01:28:10.818]  And he's, uh... It's amazing that the college students aren't... that's not required reading, but what can you say when 80% of the law schools in America do not teach the Constitution?
[01:28:12.524 --> 01:28:16.368]  I have a daughter that just graduated from law school.
[01:28:16.368 --> 01:28:23.656]  She had to almost demonstrate just to get a class on the Constitution at the University of Minnesota Law School of Law.
[01:28:26.195 --> 01:28:26.915]  Unbelievable.
[01:28:26.915 --> 01:28:28.156]  Russell Means is our guest.
[01:28:28.156 --> 01:28:30.317]  RussellMeans.com.
[01:28:30.317 --> 01:28:35.659]  Links up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:28:35.659 --> 01:28:37.540]  Russell, I mean, it's all coming to a head.
[01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:41.842]  They've preemptively built the police state up in the last 20 years.
[01:28:41.842 --> 01:28:43.102]  Now they've got it lined up.
[01:28:43.102 --> 01:28:44.863]  Now they're imploding the economy.
[01:28:44.863 --> 01:28:48.245]  And the Pentagon comes out last month and says, we're afraid of a total collapse.
[01:28:48.865 --> 01:28:51.946]  But we've got martial law ready for the civil unrest.
[01:28:51.946 --> 01:28:53.066]  We're gonna save you.
[01:28:53.066 --> 01:28:59.068]  I mean, it's amazing how they create the crisis, offer the solution.
[01:28:59.068 --> 01:29:16.534]  Exactly, and then they're still warmongering over in the Middle East, trying to control that basis, when every other major country, Europe, Russia, China, they're all making backdoor deals with the Middle East.
[01:29:17.426 --> 01:29:21.249]  Well, America is killing its young people.
[01:29:21.249 --> 01:29:28.215]  And the reason they can't beat the Afghans in Pakistan is they've got the fighting spirit of American Indians, but they've got grenade launchers.
[01:29:28.215 --> 01:29:30.276]  That's the difference.
[01:29:30.276 --> 01:29:35.761]  Grenade launchers and missile firing shoulder weapons.
[01:29:40.587 --> 01:29:44.612]  It's a dirty war that cannot be won, just like in Vietnam.
[01:29:44.612 --> 01:29:45.413]  Well, Russell, stay there.
[01:29:45.413 --> 01:29:46.754]  Let's talk about that when we come back.
[01:29:46.754 --> 01:29:50.959]  Russell means Indian Icon is our gift.
[01:29:50.959 --> 01:29:52.341]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.341 --> 01:29:54.864]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.864 --> 01:29:57.547]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:04.759 --> 01:30:06.021]  Tyranny is here.
[01:30:06.021 --> 01:30:09.885]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:30:09.885 --> 01:30:12.188]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:12.188 --> 01:30:18.055]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:30:18.055 --> 01:30:24.302]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:24.702 --> 01:30:30.687]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:30:30.687 --> 01:30:34.870]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:30:34.870 --> 01:30:39.153]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:30:39.153 --> 01:30:45.117]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:45.117 --> 01:30:48.660]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:50.641]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:30:50.641 --> 01:30:51.082]  It's here.

[01:31:00.461 --> 01:31:04.644]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:31:04.644 --> 01:31:11.049]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:31:11.049 --> 01:31:18.435]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:31:18.435 --> 01:31:23.319]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:31:32.005 --> 01:31:34.306]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:31:34.306 --> 01:31:34.627]  Call us.
[01:32:01.103 --> 01:32:15.552]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:32:16.570 --> 01:32:21.272]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:21.272 --> 01:32:34.039]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:32:34.039 --> 01:32:41.303]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.

[01:33:18.788 --> 01:33:28.537]  By the way, Matt Ryan just pointed out to me, as we try to escape from the prison planet, that it's Columbus Day, the slaver.
[01:33:29.671 --> 01:33:30.291]  I don't think so.
[01:33:50.043 --> 01:33:57.126]  It's the highest quality storable food, lasts more than 10 years in climate control, 10 years if it's in your garage or attic where I've got mine.
[01:33:57.126 --> 01:34:06.209]  High quality, non-GMO, non-hybrid, super low prices, a bunch of different, you know, they got gourmet meals that last for 10 years, they've got raw foods, they've got it all.
[01:34:07.049 --> 01:34:10.010]  Freeze-dry, dehydrated, a whole bunch of great food lines.

[01:34:16.773 --> 01:34:19.074]  efoodsdirect.com, 800-409-5633.
[01:34:19.074 --> 01:34:27.598]  In fact, I saw mainstream headlines this morning, you know, food prices exploding, the next crisis, because the dollar's being devalued.
[01:34:27.598 --> 01:34:29.779]  What did Steve Schenck, our sponsor, tell you?
[01:34:30.731 --> 01:34:31.792]  We're good to go.

[01:35:15.713 --> 01:35:16.713]  We need your support.
[01:35:16.713 --> 01:35:22.575]  That's why Thursday I'm going to broadcast for more than 24 hours live with special guests kicking off at 11 a.m.
[01:35:22.575 --> 01:35:24.216]  for InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[01:35:24.216 --> 01:35:26.056]  I want to thank all those that are already donating.
[01:35:26.056 --> 01:35:33.419]  Our goal is to raise $100,000 by Thursday when it kicks off and then raise the other $400,000 we need.
[01:35:33.419 --> 01:35:35.880]  This operation probably brings in about
[01:35:37.534 --> 01:35:37.754]  You know,
[01:35:56.907 --> 01:35:59.549]  24 plus hour broadcast that is coming out.
[01:35:59.549 --> 01:36:02.410]  And also support what Russell Means is doing at RussellMeans.com.
[01:36:02.410 --> 01:36:09.153]  We'll talk about where that sovereignty movement is going before he leaves us at the five hour, five minute after at the next hour.
[01:36:09.153 --> 01:36:10.714]  We got him on a little bit late today.
[01:36:10.714 --> 01:36:22.280]  But Russell, you got cut off talking about the Afghanistan situation, the Pakistan situation being widened by the Nobel Peace Laureate, Barack Hussein Obama.
[01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:24.201]  I mean, what a sick joke.
[01:36:24.201 --> 01:36:26.082]  You were making parallels to Vietnam.
[01:36:27.299 --> 01:36:27.899]  Exactly.
[01:36:27.899 --> 01:36:37.743]  You know, he is the first Nobel Peace Laureate that when he made his acceptance speech, he justified war.
[01:36:37.743 --> 01:36:39.863]  It was unbelievable.
[01:36:39.863 --> 01:36:42.765]  Such a slap in the Nobel's face.
[01:36:42.765 --> 01:36:46.286]  But that's a phony organization anyway.
[01:36:46.286 --> 01:36:54.289]  It comes up every once in a while with something worthwhile, but most of the time, it's for the elite.
[01:36:54.289 --> 01:36:54.729]  But yes,
[01:36:57.495 --> 01:37:23.008]  The situation in the Middle East is so blatantly obvious, and the fact that the ruling elite of America refuse to economically take advantage of the Green Revolution, you know, they're not going to go there until they have the oil unavailable.
[01:37:24.757 --> 01:37:30.039]  I'm not saying when the oil runs out, I'm saying when it's unavailable.
[01:37:30.039 --> 01:37:45.264]  The fact that Russia has most of the gold reserves left in the world, at any time they wish they could flood the market with gold and just ruin the world economy.
[01:37:45.264 --> 01:37:49.626]  Of course, they'd have to ruin their own economy at the same instant.
[01:37:49.626 --> 01:37:52.547]  But I'm just saying, people are so unaware
[01:37:53.712 --> 01:37:57.434]  Of what's really, really going on.
[01:37:57.434 --> 01:38:06.740]  You know, the debacle of the government's treatment of the BP spill in the Caribbean, for instance.
[01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:16.866]  They've been blatantly caught lying and misleading the American people about that disaster.
[01:38:16.866 --> 01:38:18.847]  It's just over and over again.
[01:38:19.696 --> 01:38:29.024]  When American people are being not only slapped across the face, but kicked in the butt, and yet they ask for more.
[01:38:29.024 --> 01:38:31.886]  Let me... Sorry, go ahead, sir.
[01:38:31.886 --> 01:38:43.676]  Well, it's like the king wears no clothes, the emperor wears no clothes, and so all the American people are starting to take off their clothes.
[01:38:43.676 --> 01:38:45.958]  It's just an absurd lifestyle.
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:52.783]  I want to shift gears into just the overall mindset of these globalists.
[01:38:52.783 --> 01:39:04.231]  They admit they want to cut off the resources to quote end industrial age so that we're basically all dependent on them in the reservation, aka the inner city slums that they've designed through dependence.
[01:39:04.231 --> 01:39:14.639]  I mean it's the same model, but I remember over a decade ago experts explaining that they were packaging the mortgages and selling them and then changing the mortgage rules and now even CNN admits
[01:39:15.419 --> 01:39:22.640]  JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and others have been caught taking houses that were totally paid for that they didn't even have a mortgage for.
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:28.422]  They've been caught selling to the Chinese the same mortgages over and over again.
[01:39:28.422 --> 01:39:34.503]  And now they've had to freeze all Bank of America foreclosures because people are learning about this.
[01:39:34.503 --> 01:39:37.843]  And just a few years ago, the media would say, oh, it's Patriot liars.
[01:39:37.843 --> 01:39:39.704]  It's Patriot, you know, propaganda.
[01:39:40.524 --> 01:39:42.205]  It's paper terrorism.
[01:39:42.205 --> 01:39:49.230]  These pro se citizens going in and pointing out that the law had been broken in all these different ways with the mortgages.
[01:39:49.230 --> 01:39:55.494]  Now the people stood up and they're talking about freezing all foreclosures because of the total fraud.
[01:39:55.494 --> 01:40:00.878]  And then that dovetails with the, I don't know if you saw this, but Bloomberg reported, it should have been bigger news.
[01:40:01.718 --> 01:40:16.900]  That Prudential and others admitted in court that they made a secret deal 11 years ago with the Pentagon, with Veterans Affairs, to take the lump-sum death benefits of 6 million dead and dying veterans going back to World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and up till today.
[01:40:18.277 --> 01:40:22.540]  And they take their money, and the government made a deal to let insurance companies do this.
[01:40:22.540 --> 01:40:44.315]  I mean, just like Corexit, the average lifespan is 51 if you use Corexit, and the Exxon Valdez cleanup, now they've used conservatively thousands of times, or over 45 million gallons of it in the Gulf, and Obama comes out and says, there's no health problems, I could play the clip, no health problems, and this stuff isn't bad for you, it's just an ongoing devastation.
[01:40:44.975 --> 01:40:48.998]  And they tell us the oil has been completely cleaned up, and later admit that's a lie.
[01:40:48.998 --> 01:40:51.760]  I mean, they're using DU all over the planet.
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:54.521]  Fourteen times birth defects and cancers in Fallujah.
[01:40:54.521 --> 01:40:56.042]  Three to four times in our own troops.
[01:40:56.042 --> 01:40:58.924]  They tell the troops, go ahead and use it, it's not bad for you.
[01:40:58.924 --> 01:41:03.387]  What is this psycho... It's just, they're destroying their own nest.
[01:41:03.387 --> 01:41:09.331]  They've gone completely loony to just crime never before seen.
[01:41:09.331 --> 01:41:14.355]  Russell, can you comment on what you would call this spirit of pure wickedness?
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:18.122]  I would call it medieval.
[01:41:18.122 --> 01:41:28.568]  It's exactly the way, you know, before Timbuktu and immediately after, that was the only place they could get gold and silver was Timbuktu in Africa.
[01:41:28.568 --> 01:41:36.673]  And so consequently, the only ones who had money were the royalty of Europe and the serfs
[01:41:37.957 --> 01:42:04.615]  We're allowed to barter and that's all their their monetary value was is in bartering, but there's a curious Exception there when during medieval times the serfs and each every time The lords of the manor the royalty would increase taxes beyond 25% The serfs would rebel now here in America
[01:42:06.112 --> 01:42:14.294]  You are taxed, the average American is taxed 43% of his income.
[01:42:14.294 --> 01:42:16.494]  And that's conservative.
[01:42:16.494 --> 01:42:19.295]  Exactly, and that's conservative, that's very conservative.
[01:42:19.295 --> 01:42:22.916]  I said the average American, that includes the unemployed.
[01:42:22.916 --> 01:42:32.058]  So, and then the other thing is, is what they've learned from the banks and the realty companies and the corporations, the government is now using
[01:42:34.225 --> 01:42:47.038]  All kinds of phony values to perpetuate the printing of their own money and to make it valuable so that they can continue
[01:42:51.528 --> 01:42:56.934]  Well, we now know they're taking thousands of houses where they don't even have the deed and the homes paid off.
[01:42:56.934 --> 01:42:59.097]  This is mainstream news.
[01:42:59.097 --> 01:43:04.823]  I mean, they must think they're invincible, but they're not because it's shutting down.
[01:43:04.823 --> 01:43:05.864]  I think they've gone
[01:43:06.425 --> 01:43:06.845]  That's my point.
[01:43:06.845 --> 01:43:07.825]  The other thing is,
[01:43:34.404 --> 01:43:34.664]  I'm good.
[01:43:50.225 --> 01:43:59.430]  The Pine Ridge and all the Sioux Indian reservations, there's nine of us in the state of South Dakota, they traded on Wall Street through Dun & Bradstreet.
[01:43:59.430 --> 01:44:10.796]  The value of the reservation, the value of each individual on the reservation, and we're all on welfare, yet we still have a phantom value on Wall Street.
[01:44:10.796 --> 01:44:12.137]  And so the tax base
[01:44:13.098 --> 01:44:14.478]  The tax base.
[01:44:14.478 --> 01:44:24.840]  We represent less than 10% of the state's population, yet we are 25% of the tax base, and we don't pay real estate taxes on the reservation.
[01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:26.420]  Go figure that out.
[01:44:26.420 --> 01:44:37.542]  And so it's understandable now that these states have been using Indian lands and Indian population in phantom financial instruments.
[01:44:37.542 --> 01:44:41.483]  Yeah, they're leveraging it and just making stuff up.
[01:44:42.162 --> 01:44:43.443]  Exactly!
[01:44:43.443 --> 01:44:47.746]  And so it's a house of paper.
[01:44:47.746 --> 01:44:49.507]  A house of cards.
[01:44:49.507 --> 01:44:50.808]  Whatever you want to label it.
[01:44:50.808 --> 01:44:53.510]  But it hasn't any financial foundation.
[01:44:53.510 --> 01:44:56.532]  And that's what America's been operating on for decades.
[01:45:01.474 --> 01:45:14.198]  So is it bold, arrogance, imperial hubris, or is it desperation that they're now getting so greedy they're grabbing houses they don't even own that are paid for?
[01:45:14.198 --> 01:45:16.858]  You've hit the nail on the head.
[01:45:16.858 --> 01:45:23.720]  They're now getting desperate because the wealth has been absolutely used up.
[01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:26.681]  The wealth of America has been used up and indebted.
[01:45:30.433 --> 01:45:40.919]  They have to go to this big monopoly money in order to, and then these phantom financial instruments, in order to keep their dominance.
[01:45:40.919 --> 01:45:44.822]  And guess where all of that phantom and the real money is going?
[01:45:44.822 --> 01:45:51.526]  Into the military so they can at least still claim a place of leadership somewhere in the world.
[01:45:51.526 --> 01:45:53.507]  Yeah, nuclear blackmail.
[01:45:53.507 --> 01:45:54.508]  Exactly.
[01:45:54.508 --> 01:45:59.491]  Well, Russell, every day I get on the show and I see all the numbers, everything we talked about now,
[01:46:00.549 --> 01:46:03.430]  Confirmed in spades, worse than I could even imagine.
[01:46:03.430 --> 01:46:04.791]  People say, Alex, you exaggerate.
[01:46:04.791 --> 01:46:05.631]  No!
[01:46:05.631 --> 01:46:08.393]  Nine times out of ten, it's worse than I can even articulate.
[01:46:08.393 --> 01:46:09.873]  I'm always learning more.
[01:46:09.873 --> 01:46:12.855]  It's so crazy that I can't even believe it.
[01:46:12.855 --> 01:46:25.881]  I know why other people can't believe this stuff, because it's so brazen, it's so naked, it's so openly insane and self-destructive, even for the controllers, but they just can't help it because they're on power trips.
[01:46:26.997 --> 01:46:28.718]  That we're in a depression.
[01:46:28.718 --> 01:46:33.719]  They've now announced they're going to hyperinflate the currency like Weimar Republic or Zimbabwe.
[01:46:33.719 --> 01:46:42.141]  And I don't think even the listeners of this show, I don't think even I, because we've had it so good so long, realize the type of hell we're entering.
[01:46:42.141 --> 01:46:44.842]  But there's two choices as Ron Paul has said.
[01:46:44.842 --> 01:46:50.984]  We either go the way of using this pain to get some freedom back and get up on our hind legs or
[01:46:52.233 --> 01:46:53.473]  We ain't seen nothing yet.
[01:46:53.473 --> 01:46:58.975]  These controllers are going to use this to set up even more power and control, and they're doing it right now, Russell.
[01:46:58.975 --> 01:47:06.838]  Your comments on this, do you agree with me that we're at a historic crossroads, make it or break it?
[01:47:06.838 --> 01:47:13.400]  I agree with that, and I also have to state that I think it's passed.
[01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:18.422]  The crossroads have passed, because when you look at our forced diets
[01:47:19.952 --> 01:47:27.854]  You know, anything that has a grain, any grain food, isn't good for you.
[01:47:27.854 --> 01:47:34.315]  You know, there isn't any food produced in America that's good for you.
[01:47:34.315 --> 01:47:36.996]  Unless you eat it raw, practically.
[01:47:36.996 --> 01:47:41.037]  And, you know, I heard your commercial.
[01:47:41.037 --> 01:47:48.659]  That's the place, you have the places, the type of places you have to go just to stay healthy in this country.
[01:47:50.117 --> 01:48:00.625]  And fortunately, on the reservation, the corporation food people haven't reached us yet, so we can still get some natural foods.
[01:48:00.625 --> 01:48:09.591]  But we have government-forced Agricultural Department food put on us every month.
[01:48:09.591 --> 01:48:14.675]  High in sodium, high in GMO, high in every poison you can think of.
[01:48:15.011 --> 01:48:28.865]  Well, how diabolical is it that people wake up to aspartame in the last 10 years, people stop buying it, so even Coke's offering Coke Zero and other alternatives, and now, go to a grocery store.
[01:48:28.865 --> 01:48:33.810]  99% of the gum, most of the time I can't even find it, that sugar for children has aspartame in it.
[01:48:33.810 --> 01:48:37.153]  I mean, I know I talked about this earlier, but think about the cold-bloodedness.
[01:48:37.153 --> 01:48:38.855]  They know this gives them cancer.
[01:48:39.943 --> 01:48:41.023]  They know.
[01:48:41.023 --> 01:48:42.644]  That's what gets me.
[01:48:42.644 --> 01:48:48.206]  And these are the corporate criminals that never are charged with anything.
[01:48:48.206 --> 01:48:58.669]  It's, uh... And the Americans... I keep going back to the irresponsibility of the American people, because that is the very first rule of freedom.
[01:48:58.669 --> 01:49:02.450]  You are free to be responsible.
[01:49:02.450 --> 01:49:04.931]  You cannot have freedom unless you're responsible.
[01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:15.509]  And to allow yourself to be poisoned, to allow your children to be stolen, allow the incarceration of innocent
[01:49:18.444 --> 01:49:19.745]  Well, we lost his phone line.
[01:49:19.745 --> 01:49:21.105]  I wonder if somebody's fiddling with it.
[01:49:21.105 --> 01:49:24.287]  They admit this guy's under federal surveillance constantly.
[01:49:24.287 --> 01:49:25.827]  We'll get Russell Means back on.
[01:49:25.827 --> 01:49:28.209]  Boy, you hear the media call him a liberal, a commie.
[01:49:28.209 --> 01:49:29.209]  He's the opposite of that.
[01:49:29.209 --> 01:49:31.110]  He's a libertarian.
[01:49:31.110 --> 01:49:36.352]  Barely lost out to Ron Paul running for libertarian president way back in the 80s.
[01:49:36.352 --> 01:49:37.853]  And that's why they hate Russell Means.
[01:49:37.853 --> 01:49:41.775]  He's really... He's Alex Jones, but before Alex Jones was born.
[01:49:42.890 --> 01:49:43.691]  Because he studied it.
[01:49:43.691 --> 01:49:45.472]  I mean, you go do the research.
[01:49:45.472 --> 01:49:51.216]  It doesn't matter if you're a white guy or a Native American or black or Asian or whatever you are.
[01:49:51.216 --> 01:49:53.718]  I mean, you know, you're a human being.
[01:49:53.718 --> 01:49:55.899]  And what we're facing is real.
[01:49:55.899 --> 01:49:59.402]  Every time he's on, the phone lines do this.
[01:49:59.402 --> 01:50:04.725]  I mean, I remember the last two interviews with Russell Means, this kind of chicanery was going on.
[01:50:04.725 --> 01:50:06.186]  So we'll continue with him.
[01:50:06.186 --> 01:50:06.807]  We'll get him back.
[01:50:08.103 --> 01:50:10.104]  On the line one time, the phones went dead.
[01:50:10.104 --> 01:50:13.625]  Russell, remember that one time you were on and the phones went dead for like 15 minutes?
[01:50:13.625 --> 01:50:15.126]  Exactly, and it happened again.
[01:50:15.126 --> 01:50:19.668]  All the power to my house was cut off.
[01:50:19.668 --> 01:50:22.169]  It's amazing.
[01:50:22.169 --> 01:50:22.849]  You still there?
[01:50:22.849 --> 01:50:23.309]  Yes, sir.
[01:50:23.309 --> 01:50:26.130]  I'm there.
[01:50:26.130 --> 01:50:29.231]  Yeah, it's diabolical.
[01:50:29.231 --> 01:50:31.492]  I'm just fed up with it.
[01:50:31.492 --> 01:50:33.213]  What was it you were saying when they cut you off?
[01:50:35.748 --> 01:50:42.875]  Well, I was talking about how the American people are not free to be responsible.
[01:50:42.875 --> 01:50:50.101]  And that's the very first rule of freedom, is that you are free to be responsible.
[01:50:50.101 --> 01:50:57.548]  And when you're so irresponsible to ignore the fact that your children are being stolen, innocent people incarcerated... Stay there, Russell.
[01:50:57.548 --> 01:50:57.988]  We gotta break.
[01:50:57.988 --> 01:50:59.410]  Come back and finish up with that on the other side.
[01:51:01.018 --> 01:51:02.319]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.319 --> 01:51:07.902]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.902 --> 01:51:12.924]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.924 --> 01:51:17.967]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:18.487 --> 01:51:23.710]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.710 --> 01:51:30.833]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.833 --> 01:51:31.954]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:31.954 --> 01:51:34.675]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:35.896 --> 01:51:40.897]  This is Alex Jones for Survival Seed Bank.
[01:52:01.971 --> 01:52:05.354]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.

[01:54:16.989 --> 01:54:21.132]  You know, Russell Means was one of the first people to expose sterilization.
[01:54:21.132 --> 01:54:28.118]  It came out in government documents that tens of thousands of Native Americans, Indians, were sterilized.
[01:54:28.118 --> 01:54:30.119]  And, of course, you know, last week it came out about...
[01:54:31.465 --> 01:54:38.569]  Guatemala and Hillary apologize, you know shooting kids men women up with a Hardcore live syphilis folks.
[01:54:38.569 --> 01:54:50.715]  This is all ongoing and and People need to get this through your head and I'm gonna briefly tell a story that I want Russell to get into this But I have a good friend Whose dad was one of the heads of a major corporation.
[01:54:50.715 --> 01:54:55.778]  I'll just leave it at that base in Houston and after his dad died we went to the funeral and
[01:54:56.581 --> 01:55:11.145]  And he told me the story about how they were at the Grand Canyon when he was a little kid with his brother and sister and there was a drunk Indian stumbling around by the Grand Canyon and his dad looked at him smugly and he said, son, you see that?
[01:55:11.145 --> 01:55:13.166]  That's why we got their land.
[01:55:14.141 --> 01:55:17.383]  Well, that's why they're putting poison in your Diet Coke and your kids' food.
[01:55:17.383 --> 01:55:21.627]  You're being poisoned so they can get you, so you can be their slave.
[01:55:21.627 --> 01:55:34.116]  And it's this attitude of yuppies and some white people, or I see it with black folks, anybody that gets some government power, with corrupt police, that they're on the winning team and it's a wink-wink, look what we're doing to them.
[01:55:34.116 --> 01:55:35.337]  Russell, your comments on that?
[01:55:36.738 --> 01:55:41.822]  Well, it's the classic colonial tool to brainwash.
[01:55:41.822 --> 01:55:49.609]  You know, once you're part of the in-group, you know, just witness the black people now.
[01:55:50.365 --> 01:55:58.847]  There are blatant acts of racism being perpetuated against them, but because they have a black president, they think they're in, so they're not saying a word.
[01:55:58.847 --> 01:56:03.368]  They're not doing a thing, and they're not helping anyone else either.
[01:56:03.368 --> 01:56:05.369]  The American people are the same way.
[01:56:05.369 --> 01:56:10.950]  It happened with the Italians, it happened with the Irish, it happened with all the immigrants that come to this country.
[01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:18.112]  Once they're in, then they ignore their constitutional rights, because they're in.
[01:56:18.112 --> 01:56:18.692]  It is
[01:56:21.642 --> 01:56:25.203]  A weakness in the American fabric.
[01:56:25.203 --> 01:56:39.487]  The only way American people can become responsible is to grab their constitution and declare their freedom from the American government and let's put them out of a job.
[01:56:41.532 --> 01:56:46.155]  The Supreme Court is blatantly corporate-controlled.
[01:56:46.155 --> 01:57:01.903]  It is on and on and on that the United States government, and we know that the present United States government was incorporated in Puerto Rico, and is not a constitutional government, and that's why it's all capitalized.
[01:57:01.903 --> 01:57:08.426]  Those of us that understand this are the freedom fighters that are left in America.
[01:57:09.764 --> 01:57:15.705]  And the American people have this fantasy of a constitutional government, which we do not have.
[01:57:15.705 --> 01:57:19.166]  We have to grab our responsibility.
[01:57:19.166 --> 01:57:28.308]  I mean, I realized, as an American Indian, that the United States of America is not going to live up to the Constitution of the United States.
[01:57:28.308 --> 01:57:32.269]  I've proven it all the way to the Supreme Court.
[01:57:32.269 --> 01:57:39.231]  So, rather than continue knocking my head against a brick wall, I didn't want my brain to turn to jelly.
[01:57:40.057 --> 01:57:49.151]  So I re-established the freedom of my people with the Republic of Lakota.
[01:57:49.151 --> 01:57:55.620]  We withdrew from our treaties with the United States of America and it's all backed by international and constitutional law.
[01:57:57.759 --> 01:58:00.861]  We're going to go to break and come back and briefly talk about that movement.
[01:58:00.861 --> 01:58:02.703]  I'm going to get you back up in the near future.
[01:58:02.703 --> 01:58:08.827]  It's been too long to have you on, sir, but I can really feel your soul, your strength, your honor.
[01:58:08.827 --> 01:58:13.251]  And I just want to point out to all those that think they're part of the in crowd, the cops, everybody else.
[01:58:13.951 --> 01:58:31.275]  Look, we're all in this together, whether you're a Native American, Indian, black, white, you better understand that, that we're all being poisoned, we're all under attack, and that at a spiritual level, we all who love freedom and decency and honor, we need to come together against this tyranny.
[01:58:31.275 --> 01:58:39.197]  I'm gonna get Russell Means' take on that statement I just made on the other side, but look, we better come together under freedom, or we're all dead meat.
[01:58:44.409 --> 01:58:48.375]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:50.640 --> 01:58:55.203]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:55.203 --> 01:58:56.104]  Number 1.
[01:58:56.104 --> 01:58:59.527]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:59.527 --> 01:59:00.387]  Number 2.
[01:59:00.387 --> 01:59:05.291]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:05.291 --> 01:59:06.031]  It's true.
[01:59:06.031 --> 01:59:10.895]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:10.895 --> 01:59:11.736]  Number 3.
[01:59:11.736 --> 01:59:15.318]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:15.318 --> 01:59:19.021]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:19.221 --> 01:59:20.022]  Number 4.
[01:59:20.022 --> 01:59:22.785]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:22.785 --> 01:59:26.469]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:26.469 --> 01:59:27.250]  Number 5.
[01:59:27.250 --> 01:59:31.395]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:31.395 --> 01:59:36.160]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:36.440 --> 01:59:40.603]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:40.603 --> 01:59:42.404]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:42.404 --> 01:59:44.646]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:59:44.646 --> 01:59:47.248]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:59:47.248 --> 01:59:48.629]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:48.629 --> 01:59:54.593]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.635 --> 02:00:06.937]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.937 --> 02:00:08.719]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.719 --> 02:00:10.461]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.461 --> 02:00:12.063]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.063 --> 02:00:13.605]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.605 --> 02:00:17.791]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.791 --> 02:00:21.856]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:34.142 --> 02:00:35.884]  Well, we've only got five minutes left with him.
[02:00:35.884 --> 02:00:41.671]  I'm going to get him back in the near future to talk about the free Indian nation.
[02:00:41.671 --> 02:00:43.673]  And internationally, it's been accepted.
[02:00:43.673 --> 02:00:46.776]  And it's important for all of us to stand up and say, I'm not under this new world order.
[02:00:46.776 --> 02:00:47.857]  America's gone.
[02:00:47.857 --> 02:00:49.319]  The globalists took it over.
[02:00:49.319 --> 02:00:51.561]  Whatever it ever was before, it's gone now.
[02:00:52.122 --> 02:00:54.624]  People better realize our country's dead before we can get it back.
[02:00:54.624 --> 02:00:59.927]  Well, I'm all for what they've done out in the area that Russell Means is in.
[02:00:59.927 --> 02:01:05.991]  Briefly, tell folks about that, and then tell folks about the sterilization of Native Americans, sir.
[02:01:05.991 --> 02:01:18.959]  Well, the Republic of Lakota, of course, is now free, and we have a strategy, both local, regional, and international.
[02:01:18.959 --> 02:01:21.261]  Our strategy is to
[02:01:22.134 --> 02:01:29.539]  Reinforce the constitutional rights and the responsibilities of citizenship.
[02:01:29.539 --> 02:01:48.371]  The fact about how America is controlling the population from Indian policy, one of the factors is through sterilization, whether it's through the food or whatever, but this was forced sterilization and sterilization by fraud. 42%
[02:01:52.350 --> 02:01:58.797]  of American Indian women in a four-year period in the 70s were forcibly sterilized.
[02:01:58.797 --> 02:02:01.059]  42% of our women.
[02:02:01.059 --> 02:02:03.741]  And George Herbert Walker Bush ran the program.
[02:02:03.741 --> 02:02:04.322]  Exactly.
[02:02:04.322 --> 02:02:06.504]  Exactly.
[02:02:06.504 --> 02:02:08.626]  Well, good point.
[02:02:08.626 --> 02:02:16.174]  And at the same time, 36% of the women, Puerto Rican women, were sterilized.
[02:02:18.505 --> 02:02:32.432]  I exposed this on a morning talk show when we went on the longest walk in 1978 into Senator Averesk, a one-term senator before he resigned.
[02:02:32.432 --> 02:02:34.413]  That's an interesting side story.
[02:02:34.413 --> 02:02:40.676]  He was at a social event on the Hill in D.C.
[02:02:40.676 --> 02:02:43.157]  and CBS News or one of the networks caught him.
[02:02:43.157 --> 02:02:45.838]  They asked him, why are you not running again?
[02:02:45.838 --> 02:02:47.539]  You only had one term in the Senate.
[02:02:48.206 --> 02:02:53.408]  And he said, he thought it was off the cuff, but they televised it.
[02:02:53.408 --> 02:02:58.591]  He said, I can't wait to get out of this chicken shit outfit.
[02:02:58.591 --> 02:03:01.132]  That was Senator Alvarez.
[02:03:01.132 --> 02:03:07.855]  He was an Arab elected to the Senate in the state of South Dakota.
[02:03:07.855 --> 02:03:15.418]  And that was the, that's why he, one of the reasons he wanted to get out because his two popular, or unpopular,
[02:03:18.203 --> 02:03:23.945]  Endeavors were supporting the Arab cause and the American Indian cause.
[02:03:23.945 --> 02:03:27.146]  Two very unpopular issues in Congress.
[02:03:27.146 --> 02:03:31.067]  So, he got out.
[02:03:31.067 --> 02:03:41.530]  Now, on the Republic of La Cota, you know, the best website to go to is RussellMeansFreedom.com.
[02:03:41.530 --> 02:03:43.071]  RussellMeansFreedom.com.
[02:03:46.738 --> 02:03:54.822]  Well, Russell, I want to get you back for a full hour in the next few weeks because there's no time like the present to go over and we'll dig them back out.
[02:03:54.822 --> 02:03:55.482]  I've got them.
[02:03:55.482 --> 02:04:00.105]  I covered my film Endgame, but it's just one of the many crimes we cover in it.
[02:04:00.105 --> 02:04:06.348]  But but now in light of people thinking about this again because of the Guatemala syphilis situation.
[02:04:07.188 --> 02:04:07.768]  Thank you for having me.
[02:04:07.768 --> 02:04:08.029]  It's great.
[02:04:08.029 --> 02:04:08.309]  I love it.
[02:04:34.838 --> 02:04:36.039]  That's the name on the head.
[02:04:36.039 --> 02:04:37.300]  We're Americans, you know.
[02:04:37.300 --> 02:04:40.903]  That's what I love about being called an American Indian.
[02:04:40.903 --> 02:04:45.006]  You know, I'm the first American and I love America.
[02:04:45.006 --> 02:04:47.428]  We have to get together.
[02:04:47.428 --> 02:04:50.050]  Again.
[02:04:50.050 --> 02:04:51.131]  We do.
[02:04:51.131 --> 02:04:53.333]  Well, Russell Means, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:04:53.333 --> 02:04:55.134]  We'll talk to you again in the very near future.
[02:04:55.134 --> 02:04:56.215]  God bless you.
[02:04:56.215 --> 02:04:57.036]  Thank you.
[02:04:57.036 --> 02:04:58.157]  Alright, there goes Russell Means.
[02:04:58.157 --> 02:05:00.098]  Dr. Doug Rocky, the head of the DEA Weapons Program.
[02:05:00.098 --> 02:05:00.399]  Coming up.
[02:05:01.431 --> 02:05:04.433]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:05:04.433 --> 02:05:09.758]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:05:09.758 --> 02:05:11.819]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:05:11.819 --> 02:05:16.823]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:05:16.823 --> 02:05:17.724]  How much do you want?
[02:05:17.984 --> 02:05:19.105]  When do you want it?
[02:05:19.105 --> 02:05:20.986]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:05:20.986 --> 02:05:22.067]  When will you need it?
[02:05:22.067 --> 02:05:24.268]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:05:24.268 --> 02:05:25.609]  Will there be any food?
[02:05:25.609 --> 02:05:27.130]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:05:27.130 --> 02:05:32.413]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:05:32.413 --> 02:05:35.996]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:05:35.996 --> 02:05:39.458]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:05:39.818 --> 02:05:41.018]  How much will you need?
[02:05:41.018 --> 02:05:41.939]  We don't know.
[02:05:41.939 --> 02:05:43.039]  How much do you want?
[02:05:43.039 --> 02:05:43.959]  All you can get.
[02:05:43.959 --> 02:05:45.060]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:05:45.060 --> 02:05:48.121]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:05:48.121 --> 02:05:49.901]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:05:49.901 --> 02:05:50.801]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:06:00.916 --> 02:06:07.579]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:06:07.579 --> 02:06:12.721]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:06:12.721 --> 02:06:21.445]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:06:21.445 --> 02:06:25.507]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:06:25.507 --> 02:06:27.888]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:06:29.947 --> 02:06:34.531]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:06:34.531 --> 02:06:38.374]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[02:06:38.374 --> 02:06:39.595]  Others don't.
[02:06:39.595 --> 02:06:41.757]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:06:41.757 --> 02:06:43.538]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[02:07:56.687 --> 02:08:00.968]  Check them out today.
[02:08:00.968 --> 02:08:06.951]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:13.044 --> 02:08:39.793]  Children's vitamins, children's anti-allergy medicine, every major manufacturer of bubble gum, sugar gum, not just the artificial sweeteners, but every manufacturer at every store we go to, you have to mail order gum or get chiclets from Mexico or old-fashioned Beeman's if you don't want aspartame in your
[02:08:41.598 --> 02:08:42.158]  We're good to go.
[02:09:08.523 --> 02:09:09.524]  Uh, with aspartame.
[02:09:09.524 --> 02:09:20.316]  To remind everyone that this is a serious issue and not a joke, here's Glenn Beck's own Fox News reporting on how aspartame has been linked to a wide range of cancers in studies involving rats.
[02:09:20.316 --> 02:09:22.438]  And we have a link to Fox News.
[02:09:22.438 --> 02:09:29.325]  The whole thing is full of universities, the government's own admissions, the studies when they tried to approve it in the 70s and failed twice.
[02:09:30.026 --> 02:09:31.327]  Brain cancers.
[02:09:31.327 --> 02:09:32.287]  Going blind.
[02:09:32.287 --> 02:09:35.929]  It breaks down into a form of wood alcohol.
[02:09:35.929 --> 02:09:38.030]  What is bad, you know, moonshine to it?
[02:09:38.030 --> 02:09:39.811]  Makes you go blind.
[02:09:39.811 --> 02:09:40.831]  Okay, they're sitting a game.
[02:09:40.831 --> 02:09:42.332]  They're sitting a game.
[02:09:43.311 --> 02:09:46.552]  And Glenn Beck is falling apart like millions of other Americans.
[02:09:46.552 --> 02:10:02.277]  And since we exposed aspartame in the last 15 years, along with many others, with Betty Martini and Dr. Russell Blaylock and countless others, scientists, researchers, you name it, they now just come out with over 10,000 products with aspartame in it.
[02:10:02.277 --> 02:10:05.058]  It's in TV dinners now for no reason.
[02:10:05.058 --> 02:10:07.379]  It's just in everything.
[02:10:07.379 --> 02:10:07.479]  And
[02:10:08.979 --> 02:10:10.180]  It is a soft kill weapon.
[02:10:10.180 --> 02:10:13.502]  They don't just shoot Guatemalan children up with syphilis.
[02:10:13.502 --> 02:10:14.283]  That's admitted.
[02:10:14.283 --> 02:10:21.388]  They don't just give African children, this year and last year, CBS AP report, live polio to kill them.
[02:10:21.388 --> 02:10:22.288]  Weaponized polio.
[02:10:22.288 --> 02:10:22.929]  That's mainstream.
[02:10:22.929 --> 02:10:25.951]  Oh, accidentally, all over the world, we just give them live polio.
[02:10:25.951 --> 02:10:30.394]  They didn't put SV40 in the polio vaccines, the cancer virus, to play patty cake with you.
[02:10:30.854 --> 02:10:38.338]  They're not doing, and of course these companies are just idiotic and are told, hey, here's Aspartame, the patent's run out on it, it's really cheap, it's really sweet, kids will love it.
[02:10:38.338 --> 02:10:40.039]  That's why they sign on and do it.
[02:10:40.039 --> 02:10:41.900]  Most of these corporate people don't even know.
[02:10:41.900 --> 02:10:44.041]  Because the government's given it its seal of approval.
[02:10:46.198 --> 02:10:49.661]  And all these scientists have come out and talked about how horrible this is.
[02:10:49.661 --> 02:10:58.968]  And the reason I'm starting this interview for the next hour and a half with Dr. Doug Rocky with this information is that it's part and parcel to this overall eugenics agenda.
[02:10:58.968 --> 02:11:02.770]  Ignore it at your own risk.
[02:11:02.770 --> 02:11:04.412]  Ignore it at your own peril.
[02:11:04.412 --> 02:11:04.572]  Now,
[02:11:07.256 --> 02:11:11.659]  I wanted to get Dr. Doug Rocky on, he was on with us two weeks ago, because I want to open the phones up.
[02:11:11.659 --> 02:11:27.252]  I want him to recap DU, what he did, what it causes, the health problems, members of his team dead and dying, himself very sick, 20 plus surgeries later, what it does, and the fact that they're massively proliferating the use of it, including here in the US.
[02:11:27.252 --> 02:11:30.774]  Fourteen time increases in cancers and deformities and Fallujah.
[02:11:30.774 --> 02:11:33.516]  Three to four times in major medical studies of our troops.
[02:11:33.516 --> 02:11:35.058]  This is a holocaust!
[02:11:35.859 --> 02:11:37.701]  A holocaust!
[02:11:37.701 --> 02:11:51.151]  And I wanted to open the phones up for military veterans currently serving, or who were in, who, you know, worked with DU earlier, remember, you know, back before they allowed it to be used everywhere, how it was labeled completely deadly, radioactive and poisonous.
[02:11:52.366 --> 02:11:52.846]  We're good to go.
[02:12:13.263 --> 02:12:16.306]  I know I can prove aspartame is totally deadly.
[02:12:16.306 --> 02:12:19.510]  This is so mainstream, the Drudge Report links to our articles on it.
[02:12:19.510 --> 02:12:24.875]  I know I can prove that they sterilized 42% of Native American women in the 70s alone.
[02:12:24.875 --> 02:12:27.238]  That's declassified Senate hearings.
[02:12:27.238 --> 02:12:30.902]  I know I can prove they're shooting little children up with live syphilis.
[02:12:30.902 --> 02:12:32.984]  Okay, you're not in Kansas anymore.
[02:12:32.984 --> 02:12:35.547]  I can prove that most mortgages are fraudulent.
[02:12:36.127 --> 02:12:39.730]  And that they're stealing people's houses with 100% paid-for homes.
[02:12:39.730 --> 02:12:46.836]  I can prove, and it's admitted, that they signed a deal 11 years ago to take the death benefits of 6 million veterans as they die.
[02:12:46.836 --> 02:12:48.178]  Bloomberg.
[02:12:48.178 --> 02:12:54.063]  I can prove that the carbon taxes are to shut down our economy and consolidate it and bring in feudalism.
[02:12:55.635 --> 02:12:56.236]  Okay?
[02:12:56.236 --> 02:12:58.479]  We've got to get DU off the battlefield.
[02:12:58.479 --> 02:12:59.741]  We've got to stop using it.
[02:12:59.741 --> 02:13:01.924]  We've got to get healthcare to the people that have gone through this.
[02:13:01.924 --> 02:13:04.548]  So, for this segment and the next, Dr. Rocky will have the floor.
[02:13:04.548 --> 02:13:05.349]  I'll try to shut up.
[02:13:05.349 --> 02:13:07.252]  It's just such a key issue.
[02:13:07.252 --> 02:13:09.835]  And then we're going to take phone calls for the whole next hour.
[02:13:11.152 --> 02:13:17.195]  From people exposed to DU, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:13:17.195 --> 02:13:19.496]  On this subject only, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:13:19.496 --> 02:13:35.644]  Then the last 20 minutes or so, we're gonna have Mr. Irish who had his child stolen, newborn baby, and they sourced in the affidavit, and the full affidavit now posted at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com because they're a member of Oath Keepers.
[02:13:36.522 --> 02:13:39.543]  Okay, this is big national news on Drudge Report as well.
[02:13:39.543 --> 02:13:44.445]  So we're going to be talking about that with them and updates at the end of the hour, end of the next hour.
[02:13:44.445 --> 02:13:46.706]  But Dr. Doug Rocky now joins us.
[02:13:46.706 --> 02:13:48.026]  He is a depleted uranium expert.
[02:13:48.026 --> 02:13:49.667]  He's known as Dr. D.U.
[02:13:49.667 --> 02:13:50.627]  He earned a B.S.
[02:13:50.627 --> 02:13:53.468]  in physics from Western Illinois University following his M.S.
[02:13:53.468 --> 02:13:54.009]  and Ph.D.
[02:13:54.009 --> 02:13:57.530]  in physics and technology education at the University of Illinois.
[02:13:57.530 --> 02:14:02.232]  His military career has spanned four decades to include combat duty during the Vietnam War and Gulf War I.
[02:14:03.413 --> 02:14:05.635]  Dr. Doug Rocky served as a member of the 3rd U.S.
[02:14:05.635 --> 02:14:12.902]  Army Medical Command Nuclear Biological Chemical NBC Teaching Medical Response and Special Operations Team, the 3rd U.S.
[02:14:12.902 --> 02:14:17.286]  Army Captured Equipment Project Team, and the 3rd U.S.
[02:14:17.286 --> 02:14:20.530]  Army Depleted Uranium Assessment Team during Gulf War I Operation Desert Storm.
[02:14:20.990 --> 02:14:21.711]  He was the U.S.
[02:14:21.711 --> 02:14:27.455]  Army's depleted uranium project director of the Army's DU program from 94 to 95 and wrote the book on it.
[02:14:27.455 --> 02:14:31.278]  He developed the congressionally mandated education and training materials, wrote the U.S.
[02:14:31.278 --> 02:14:32.258]  Army Regulation 700-48, the U.S.
[02:14:32.258 --> 02:14:33.940]  Army PAM 700-48, the Army's command task DU incidents.
[02:14:39.764 --> 02:14:46.530]  Doug has taught nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare hazards material in emergency medicine for 20 years to both civilian and military personnel.
[02:14:46.530 --> 02:14:59.442]  Dr. Doug Rocky was one of the original authors of the 82 ED-RAT, Emergency Disaster Response Assistance Team, proposal which formed the foundation of today's National Guard CSD teams and the Illinois CERT teams in preparation for the 1996 Olympics.
[02:15:01.103 --> 02:15:16.816]  In Atlanta he wrote and taught the original chemical biological counter-terrorism course for the civilian emergency responders and is now in use in 120 by the federal government 120 city and departments and the Justice Department course and then serve as emergency response team located in Birmingham, Alabama.
[02:15:16.816 --> 02:15:27.384]  And he sent us an entire stack, I'm looking for them, here it is, of government declassified documents where they admit and Los Alamos admits this stuff will kill you deader than a hammer.
[02:15:28.061 --> 02:15:28.661]  Okay.
[02:15:28.661 --> 02:15:30.482]  Dr. Doug Rocky, we're honored to have you.
[02:15:30.482 --> 02:15:31.603]  You've got the floor, sir.
[02:15:31.603 --> 02:15:32.744]  Break it down.
[02:15:32.744 --> 02:15:36.386]  Thank you very much, sir, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:15:36.386 --> 02:15:38.327]  I don't know where to begin.
[02:15:38.327 --> 02:15:43.170]  This has been a nightmare for over 20 years that I've been involved, and it continues to be a nightmare.
[02:15:43.170 --> 02:15:56.478]  There is not a single day that does not go by, 24 hours a day, where I do not get a phone call or an email or a knock on the door from a sick, ill, wounded, injured veteran or their family members seeking help.
[02:15:57.418 --> 02:16:00.239]  Much less when I'm trying to get my own help.
[02:16:00.239 --> 02:16:02.400]  It's been an ongoing, it's been an ongoing thing.
[02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:13.665]  I mean, uh, when we look at what has happened, the United States going back, uh, you know, many, many years ago with all the downwinders and the atomic bomb testing and everything else.
[02:16:13.665 --> 02:16:17.246]  And then we had all the Agent Orange from Vietnam.
[02:16:17.246 --> 02:16:26.930]  Then we kept going and we kept going with all the immunization mess, the Project Shad stuff, which is again, deliberate use of chemical and biological warfare munitions on civilians.
[02:16:27.822 --> 02:16:31.525]  All over the United States and the military, and that continues as we speak.
[02:16:31.525 --> 02:16:34.647]  And then we get to D.U.
[02:16:34.647 --> 02:16:38.830]  Ah, Desert Storm, what a wonder.
[02:16:38.830 --> 02:16:48.077]  How, how... How do we, in our right mind, justify what we have done to the world and what we've done to our sons and daughters?
[02:16:48.077 --> 02:16:53.721]  I mean, Alex, how can anybody justify what we've done?
[02:16:53.721 --> 02:16:54.041]  Are you there?
[02:16:54.041 --> 02:16:56.403]  Yeah, well, the Cowboys are on, that's all that matters.
[02:16:58.376 --> 02:16:59.856]  You know, that's part of the whole thing.
[02:16:59.856 --> 02:17:20.880]  I think one of the most astonishing things about all this is that most individuals truly are more interested in a football game or a basketball game or a, you know, whatever they have in a six-pack of beer, rather than dealing with the health and environmental consequences of military operations or our industry that's just trashed our world, aren't they?
[02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:25.941]  I mean, why don't people, you know, I can't understand why people don't see this and they don't feel outraged.
[02:17:27.335 --> 02:17:33.596]  Well, they're poisoned through the food, the vaccines, the aspartame, the fluoride, and they're childlike.
[02:17:33.596 --> 02:17:38.697]  They can't believe their government would hurt them or do something bad.
[02:17:38.697 --> 02:17:46.598]  And if they ever face the fact that all of this is real, that they're being soft-killed along with their family, they'd have to do something about it.
[02:17:46.598 --> 02:17:49.599]  But more and more people are waking up and getting concerned.
[02:17:49.599 --> 02:17:50.459]  Well, they have to.
[02:17:50.459 --> 02:17:53.960]  I mean, you know, slowly I'm getting more congressional staff that are listening.
[02:17:53.960 --> 02:17:56.100]  But I still have too many that don't want to do anything.
[02:17:56.698 --> 02:17:57.799]  We've got an election coming up.
[02:17:57.799 --> 02:18:00.941]  Ladies and gentlemen, this election coming up is critical.
[02:18:00.941 --> 02:18:05.504]  You know, what we're hearing all over on the ads here in Illinois is continuous mudslinging.
[02:18:05.504 --> 02:18:10.047]  He did this, or he didn't do this, or he wasn't nice, or he didn't give me my Cheerios.
[02:18:10.047 --> 02:18:13.449]  I want to know what they're going to do to clean up the environment.
[02:18:13.449 --> 02:18:20.493]  I want to know what they're going to do to stop the slaughter of our sons and daughters, and the slaughter of all the other children in the world.
[02:18:20.493 --> 02:18:26.057]  I want to know what they're going to do to provide medical care for all of the military veterans that have earned it.
[02:18:26.713 --> 02:18:32.158]  Because we went on these missions that we never really needed to do, but we got totally trashed.
[02:18:32.158 --> 02:18:36.381]  I mean, that's what needs to happen.
[02:18:36.381 --> 02:18:37.182]  I don't know.
[02:18:37.182 --> 02:18:38.483]  It's irritating.
[02:18:38.483 --> 02:18:47.290]  And I know, Alex, you must, I mean, you're doing a radio show day in and day out, and you hear people all outraged all over the world trying to do something, trying to make a difference.
[02:18:47.290 --> 02:18:49.232]  You try to make a difference.
[02:18:49.232 --> 02:18:52.815]  But the question I have is, why isn't a difference being made?
[02:18:52.815 --> 02:18:53.816]  Why don't we see changes?
[02:18:55.011 --> 02:19:03.654]  Well, we're seeing an acceleration of evil in an attempt to totally overwhelm us and make us capitulate.
[02:19:03.654 --> 02:19:15.498]  We are seeing changes in the foreclosures being halted by five major banks, including Bank of America, the biggest mortgage holder in the country, because it's come out that most of the mortgages were written up fraudulently.
[02:19:19.008 --> 02:19:21.689]  The empire's falling, the dollar's imploding.
[02:19:21.689 --> 02:19:25.911]  I think, I think, I think we are seeing change.
[02:19:25.911 --> 02:19:42.118]  I mean, I'm sure you've seen the movie Force 10 from Navarone as a parallel, and then we'll go to break, but they go into the dam, and they bomb it, and they're trying to bomb it to stop the German army going into the Balkans, and they're sitting there waiting, and they look at the bomb expert, and they say, why hasn't it fallen?
[02:19:42.118 --> 02:19:43.639]  Why hasn't the dam ruptured?
[02:19:43.639 --> 02:19:45.380]  He says, give it a minute.
[02:19:45.380 --> 02:19:45.900]  Give it a minute.
[02:19:47.017 --> 02:19:51.666]  And then it starts cracking and then it totally implodes.
[02:19:51.666 --> 02:19:54.451]  And so the dam now has water shooting out of it.
[02:19:54.451 --> 02:19:55.974]  I mean, we see the holes forming.
[02:19:55.974 --> 02:19:58.198]  The problem is we're going to get drowned when it collapses.
[02:19:58.198 --> 02:19:58.738]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:01.052 --> 02:20:05.614]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:20:05.614 --> 02:20:06.514]  Number one.
[02:20:06.514 --> 02:20:09.936]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:20:09.936 --> 02:20:10.816]  Number two.
[02:20:10.816 --> 02:20:15.698]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:20:15.698 --> 02:20:16.438]  It's true.
[02:20:16.438 --> 02:20:21.000]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:20:21.300 --> 02:20:22.141]  Number 3.
[02:20:22.141 --> 02:20:25.724]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:20:25.724 --> 02:20:29.648]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:20:29.648 --> 02:20:30.428]  Number 4.
[02:20:30.428 --> 02:20:33.191]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:20:33.191 --> 02:20:36.874]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:20:36.874 --> 02:20:37.675]  Number 5.
[02:20:37.675 --> 02:20:41.819]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:20:41.819 --> 02:20:46.583]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:20:46.863 --> 02:20:51.025]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:20:51.025 --> 02:20:52.806]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:20:52.806 --> 02:20:55.066]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:20:55.066 --> 02:20:57.668]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:20:57.668 --> 02:21:01.129]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:21:05.851 --> 02:21:06.812]  What have we got?
[02:21:06.812 --> 02:21:09.254]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:21:09.254 --> 02:21:10.274]  A republic.
[02:21:10.274 --> 02:21:12.916]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:21:12.916 --> 02:21:15.198]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:21:15.198 --> 02:21:17.220]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:21:17.220 --> 02:21:18.901]  So they think they own our land?
[02:21:18.901 --> 02:21:20.222]  They think they own our water?
[02:21:20.222 --> 02:21:20.823]  Children?
[02:21:20.823 --> 02:21:21.943]  Our education?
[02:21:21.943 --> 02:21:22.764]  Our money?
[02:21:22.764 --> 02:21:26.427]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:21:26.787 --> 02:21:30.492]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:21:30.492 --> 02:21:31.754]  You're being warned.
[02:21:31.754 --> 02:21:32.775]  We have the facts.
[02:21:32.775 --> 02:21:33.937]  We have the Constitution.
[02:21:33.937 --> 02:21:34.858]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:21:34.858 --> 02:21:35.739]  We have common law.
[02:21:35.739 --> 02:21:38.263]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:21:38.263 --> 02:21:42.048]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:21:42.148 --> 02:21:47.093]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:21:47.093 --> 02:21:48.594]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:21:48.594 --> 02:21:49.675]  Don't tread on me.
[02:21:49.675 --> 02:21:56.162]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:22:01.161 --> 02:22:08.906]  Hi, this is Dwayne Dally with Midas Resources Precious Metals Brokers and my phone number is 800-686-2237 extension 115.
[02:22:08.906 --> 02:22:13.209]  If you are sick and tired of being sick and tired, then perhaps it's time for a change.
[02:22:13.209 --> 02:22:20.693]  You have the opportunity to make a change in November by voting and the opportunity to make a change in your financial security today by calling me, Dwayne Dally.

[02:22:26.937 --> 02:22:34.203]  As the inflation pinch becomes tighter and the dollar continues to devalue, while stocks remain iffy at best, stop the bleeding with precious metals.
[02:22:34.203 --> 02:22:38.948]  Metals will let you retain your purchasing power, protect your assets, and stop inflation the day you get in.
[02:22:38.948 --> 02:22:45.133]  I have many different ways to accomplish this, from metals for possession to IRA rollovers, tax-free, and everything in between.
[02:22:45.133 --> 02:22:47.195]  So if you would like to turn your scrambled nest egg
[02:22:47.335 --> 02:22:48.235]  What is a wind generator?
[02:22:48.235 --> 02:22:49.896]  How can the wind produce power for a small cabin?
[02:22:49.896 --> 02:22:51.997]  How can wind energy be stored and used during an emergency?
[02:22:51.997 --> 02:22:53.478]  Can I assemble my own wind generator?

[02:23:53.541 --> 02:23:53.942]  That's 800-976-0026.
[02:24:06.482 --> 02:24:22.534]  To elaborate on Dr. Doug Rocky, former head of DU Weapons Program for the Army and Army Research in DU, it does not require a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless minority keen to set brush fires in people's minds.
[02:24:22.534 --> 02:24:29.159]  That was Sam Adams, one of the original Firestarters of Liberty in 1776.
[02:24:29.159 --> 02:24:33.582]  Doc, I want you to get into the basics of DU, then I want to get into Carl's next segment, but I understand
[02:24:34.443 --> 02:24:36.264]  Okay, let's talk about depleted uranium specifics.
[02:24:36.264 --> 02:24:38.145]  First off, the term depleted is a misnomer.
[02:25:03.786 --> 02:25:06.729]  There's nothing really depleted about it.
[02:25:06.729 --> 02:25:12.154]  Uranium munitions are actually the byproduct of the uranium enrichment process conducted by the U.S.
[02:25:12.154 --> 02:25:13.695]  Department of Energy.
[02:25:13.695 --> 02:25:22.383]  For every 100 pounds of pure uranium that goes in the enrichment process, 99.2 pounds is pure waste.
[02:25:22.383 --> 02:25:22.844]  Okay?
[02:25:22.844 --> 02:25:27.488]  And that's what we call uranium hexafluoride, which is a process to form uranium munitions.
[02:25:28.460 --> 02:25:33.061]  Uh, uranium munitions consist of kinetic energy penetrators or bullets.
[02:25:33.061 --> 02:25:38.942]  So we have the 5.56 millimeter, the 7.62 millimeter and the 50 caliber.
[02:25:38.942 --> 02:25:41.683]  Those are rifle bullets are made out of the uranium.
[02:25:41.683 --> 02:25:50.564]  Then we have the 20 millimeter for the Navy Phalanx, the 25 millimeter for the Army Bradley Fighting Vehicle and the Marine Corps Lab, etc.
[02:25:50.564 --> 02:25:53.505]  The 30 millimeter for on the gunships and everything in the A-10.
[02:25:54.727 --> 02:26:01.091]  Then we get up to the tank rounds, 105mm, 125mm, and the primary 120mm.
[02:26:01.091 --> 02:26:05.614]  Now these are all gigantic slugs of uranium.
[02:26:05.614 --> 02:26:11.577]  And what they're actually made of is uranium hexafluoride, which is the primary product that went into it.
[02:26:11.577 --> 02:26:19.642]  But what we end up with is these isotopes, uranium-234, uranium-235, which is uranium-236, uranium-238, which is the predominant amount, probably 99% of it,
[02:26:25.083 --> 02:26:28.726]  Plutonium, Neptunium, and Americium.
[02:26:28.726 --> 02:26:33.350]  So we have a toxic radiological compound that this stuff is made up of.
[02:26:33.350 --> 02:26:37.334]  So what we end up with is a whole host of uranium additions.
[02:26:37.334 --> 02:26:41.177]  The kinetic energy penetrators, which are like bullets or giant rods of uranium.
[02:26:41.177 --> 02:26:42.458]  Think of gigantic darts.
[02:26:42.458 --> 02:26:43.939]  You know, everybody's played darts.
[02:26:43.939 --> 02:26:45.741]  That's what these look like.
[02:26:45.741 --> 02:26:48.904]  Except that the tank round is 10 pounds of uranium.
[02:26:48.904 --> 02:26:52.787]  And the 30 millimeter round that's fired by the A-10 is 3 quarters of a pound of uranium.
[02:26:53.291 --> 02:26:54.972]  Fired at 4,000 rounds a minute.
[02:26:54.972 --> 02:26:58.655]  That's one and a half tons of uranium on target per minute.
[02:26:58.655 --> 02:27:03.038]  Incredible amount of volume of uranium re-wrecked materials.
[02:27:03.038 --> 02:27:05.279]  And then up and beyond that we have the Atom and the Pitom.
[02:27:05.279 --> 02:27:08.321]  Now the Atom and the Pitom, think about a giant softball.
[02:27:08.321 --> 02:27:11.183]  The outer casing of the softball is made of uranium.
[02:27:11.183 --> 02:27:12.464]  DU.
[02:27:12.464 --> 02:27:14.906]  And it's filled with high explosives.
[02:27:14.906 --> 02:27:19.850]  Incredibly effective against all personnel and animals and children and everything else.
[02:27:19.850 --> 02:27:21.811]  Totally used by the Israelis in Lebanon.
[02:27:22.498 --> 02:27:26.792]  Totally used by the Israelis in Gaza, by the US in the Balkans, and again Iraq.
[02:27:27.799 --> 02:27:38.405]  And by the way, the prevailing winds out of Gaza blow right into Israel, and the winds also blow from the north for part of the year, right out of Lebanon.
[02:27:38.405 --> 02:27:52.274]  And I mean, it's just, it's the equivalent of a gun that you fire at your enemy, but it fires a soft kill weapon back at you, because as you know, sir, the rounds ignite as they leave the barrel, and are shedding massive amounts of this uranium.
[02:27:53.097 --> 02:27:54.017]  Absolutely correct.
[02:27:54.017 --> 02:27:59.941]  See, one of the things that people would like everybody to believe is that this stuff doesn't do anything until it hits the target, and that's pure nonsense.
[02:27:59.941 --> 02:28:03.582]  It's shedding immediately, and that's what we've proven in a bunch of videos and photographs.
[02:28:03.582 --> 02:28:14.648]  You can go back and pull up the stuff that we did for CBS Evening with Dan Rather, you can pull up the stuff on 60 Minutes, on Dateline, Nine Line, the BBC, the Canadian Broadcasting, you can see it all there.
[02:28:14.648 --> 02:28:17.750]  You can pull up the videos and actually look at it yourself and find out how it works.
[02:28:18.652 --> 02:28:25.314]  You know, so what we do know, the very earliest work that I know of and the work that I used for it when I was Director of the Depleted Uranium Project for the U.S.
[02:28:25.314 --> 02:28:36.637]  Army, I used all the research reports when the United States gave Israel uranium munitions to use against the Egyptians during the Arab-Israeli War in 1973.
[02:28:36.637 --> 02:28:46.680]  And so our 1974 report, which confirmed all the health and environmental effects, was written as a consequence of giving Israel the used uranium munitions to use in that
[02:28:47.355 --> 02:28:47.795]  We're good to go.
[02:29:14.235 --> 02:29:18.620]  So when we set up Desert Storm in early spring of 1990 to get the U.S.
[02:29:18.620 --> 02:29:26.790]  military in there to control the oil, we did all our maintenance switching to get Saddam to give him the approval to go into Kuwait.
[02:29:27.873 --> 02:29:28.894]  Doc, stay there.
[02:29:28.894 --> 02:29:30.215]  Long segment coming up.
[02:29:30.215 --> 02:29:42.406]  We're going to have you finish up on the basics of DU, then we're going to phone calls from victims of DU, and so they can talk to you on air, and we can flesh this out even more.
[02:29:42.406 --> 02:29:43.207]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:43.207 --> 02:29:44.948]  On the other side, the toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[02:29:44.948 --> 02:29:45.208]  Stay with us.
[02:29:45.208 --> 02:29:45.909]  We're on the march.
[02:29:45.909 --> 02:29:46.490]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.234 --> 02:30:00.999]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.999 --> 02:30:02.641]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[02:30:54.351 --> 02:30:54.791]  Thank you!
[02:31:00.520 --> 02:31:05.084]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:05.084 --> 02:31:06.004]  Number 1.
[02:31:06.004 --> 02:31:09.427]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.427 --> 02:31:10.288]  Number 2.
[02:31:10.288 --> 02:31:15.171]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:15.171 --> 02:31:15.912]  It's true.
[02:31:15.912 --> 02:31:20.796]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:20.796 --> 02:31:21.616]  Number 3.
[02:31:21.616 --> 02:31:25.199]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.199 --> 02:31:28.882]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:29.102 --> 02:31:29.902]  Number 4.
[02:31:29.902 --> 02:31:32.663]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.663 --> 02:31:36.344]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.344 --> 02:31:37.124]  Number 5.
[02:31:37.124 --> 02:31:41.265]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.265 --> 02:31:46.327]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:46.327 --> 02:31:50.508]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:50.508 --> 02:31:52.289]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:52.289 --> 02:31:56.890]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[02:31:57.210 --> 02:31:58.150]  877-327-0365.
[02:31:58.150 --> 02:32:04.054]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:32:04.054 --> 02:32:09.376]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:32:09.376 --> 02:32:11.417]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:32:11.417 --> 02:32:16.420]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:32:16.420 --> 02:32:17.601]  How much do you want?
[02:32:17.601 --> 02:32:18.341]  When do you want it?
[02:32:18.721 --> 02:32:20.601]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:32:20.601 --> 02:32:21.682]  When will you need it?
[02:32:21.682 --> 02:32:23.882]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:32:23.882 --> 02:32:25.223]  Will there be any food?
[02:32:25.223 --> 02:32:26.743]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:32:26.743 --> 02:32:32.024]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:32:32.024 --> 02:32:35.605]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:32:35.605 --> 02:32:39.066]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:32:39.426 --> 02:32:40.647]  How much will you need?
[02:32:40.647 --> 02:32:41.547]  We don't know.
[02:32:41.547 --> 02:32:42.648]  How much do you want?
[02:32:42.648 --> 02:32:43.568]  All you can get.
[02:32:43.568 --> 02:32:44.669]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:32:44.669 --> 02:32:47.730]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:32:47.730 --> 02:32:50.851]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:32:50.851 --> 02:32:51.772]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:33:08.613 --> 02:33:13.076]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:33:13.076 --> 02:33:19.900]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:19.900 --> 02:33:22.361]  We're going back to Dr. Doug Rocky, Dr.
[02:33:22.361 --> 02:33:24.263]  D.U., the former head of the Army's program.
[02:33:24.263 --> 02:33:27.545]  I don't think we can get a better informed expert on this, though.
[02:33:27.545 --> 02:33:31.367]  He sent me these big stacks I want to go through before we go to your calls here in a moment.
[02:33:32.543 --> 02:33:36.488]  Department of Army Technical Bulletin TB9-1300-278 suppressed copy dated 28 September 1990.
[02:33:44.855 --> 02:33:48.779]  We'll talk about how these went public, and we'll get into all of this.
[02:33:48.779 --> 02:33:56.427]  But before we go any further, there's other secret atmospheric testing and weather manipulation that's now been partially declassified.
[02:33:56.427 --> 02:33:58.109]  And it deals with chemtrails.
[02:33:58.109 --> 02:34:04.135]  Not condensation trails, but planes engaging in weather modification with barium salts and aluminum dioxide.
[02:34:04.135 --> 02:34:05.056]  Also very toxic.
[02:34:05.056 --> 02:34:06.837]  Nothing compared to DU, but overall very bad.
[02:34:07.658 --> 02:34:08.019]  I think so.
[02:34:24.315 --> 02:34:24.715]  We're good to go.
[02:34:41.212 --> 02:34:42.633]  And you can also write to us at P.O.
[02:34:42.633 --> 02:34:45.777]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[02:34:45.777 --> 02:34:49.222]  You're going to be the first to get What in the World Are They Spraying?
[02:34:49.222 --> 02:34:54.528]  Okay, Dr. Rockey, you got cut off getting into the Gulf War, and we'll get into these documents and then straight to the phone calls.
[02:34:54.528 --> 02:34:55.890]  That's a toll-free number to join us.
[02:34:55.890 --> 02:34:56.951]  We're going to get to Danny.
[02:34:58.786 --> 02:35:00.487]  Dante, Noah, and others.
[02:35:00.487 --> 02:35:08.189]  1-800-259-9231 for folks that have been affected themselves or their family members by DU.
[02:35:08.189 --> 02:35:12.651]  Veterans that were in Fallujah having problems or anywhere else in Iraq.
[02:35:12.651 --> 02:35:20.193]  Folks from Iraq or people who have family there that have seen 14 times increases in cancers and birth defects.
[02:35:20.193 --> 02:35:20.673]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:35:20.673 --> 02:35:23.714]  Dr. Doug Rockey, please continue.
[02:35:23.714 --> 02:35:26.435]  Well, what we have then is uranium munitions of all types.
[02:35:26.435 --> 02:35:28.216]  We have the bunker busters and all this stuff.
[02:35:28.823 --> 02:35:36.530]  When these things are used, they create an extremely fine uranium dust, which is radiologically and chemically toxic.
[02:35:36.530 --> 02:35:39.813]  And now, that creates air, water, soil, and food contamination.
[02:35:39.813 --> 02:35:47.860]  The Army's own documents state very clearly, after this is used, it causes food and water contamination, makes food and water unusable for eternity.
[02:35:47.860 --> 02:35:49.041]  So we have all of that.
[02:35:49.041 --> 02:35:52.765]  So now what we're having is cross-contamination by ingestion.
[02:35:52.765 --> 02:35:54.206]  That's through eating and drinking.
[02:35:55.273 --> 02:35:57.093]  We have inhalation through breathing.
[02:35:57.093 --> 02:35:59.034]  We have absorption through the skin.
[02:35:59.034 --> 02:36:00.394]  And it goes right through the skin.
[02:36:00.394 --> 02:36:02.175]  It moves right in.
[02:36:02.175 --> 02:36:05.776]  And then obviously we have wound contamination through open wounds.
[02:36:05.776 --> 02:36:08.116]  The dust gets in there and the shrapnel.
[02:36:08.116 --> 02:36:09.197]  So we have all of this stuff.
[02:36:09.197 --> 02:36:11.097]  So we have all the direct medical effects.
[02:36:11.097 --> 02:36:11.737]  Now the U.S.
[02:36:11.737 --> 02:36:16.318]  Army orders, direct orders, require immediate radio bioassays.
[02:36:16.318 --> 02:36:21.340]  Now the Somalia order, which is from October 1993, Colonel Peter Myers, Dr. Peter Myers wrote it.
[02:36:23.815 --> 02:36:33.399]  As we were getting ready to use uranium in Somalia and Africa in 1993 and again required a radio bioassay within 24 to 72 hours of exposure.
[02:36:33.399 --> 02:36:35.940]  Not days, weeks, months or years later.
[02:36:35.940 --> 02:36:39.002]  Within 24 to 72 hours.
[02:36:39.002 --> 02:36:52.528]  And the reason for that is what we do know and we wrote the medical directives is that if you wait until after 30 days post exposure, in other words, if you start, you know, today, whatever today is, we waited 30 days to start the radio bioassay.
[02:36:54.076 --> 02:37:03.584]  The radio bioassay won't detect what your body actually got hit with because what's mobile now in the urine is less than 1-1,000 of what actually was in the body.
[02:37:03.584 --> 02:37:09.188]  So in other words, they delay the testing and therefore there's nothing there to be found and therefore there was no exposure.
[02:37:09.188 --> 02:37:22.179]  This was a deliberate decision, deliberate act that was made many times and then Dr. Bernard Rosker and Dr. Michael Kilpatrick formalized it along with Colonel Bob Cherry, Colonel Eric Jackson, and Colonel Mark Melanson from the U.S.
[02:37:22.179 --> 02:37:22.599]  military.
[02:37:23.829 --> 02:37:26.151]  So we have all of these problems coming along.
[02:37:26.151 --> 02:37:27.352]  No two ways about it.
[02:37:27.352 --> 02:37:28.773]  Absolutely identified.
[02:37:28.773 --> 02:37:31.835]  There's probably been a dozen medical orders.
[02:37:31.835 --> 02:37:42.443]  And the other thing we need to know is, when we require the medical care and medical orders for our own military by a Geneva Convention under God, we have to provide the same medical care to everybody we expose.
[02:37:42.443 --> 02:37:44.965]  Which is millions upon billions of people.
[02:37:44.965 --> 02:37:47.087]  So the orders are there to do it.
[02:37:47.087 --> 02:37:52.391]  Now, the most recent orders were written by General Peake, who was the previous Secretary of the U.S.
[02:37:52.391 --> 02:37:53.432]  Department of Veterans Affairs.
[02:37:54.267 --> 02:37:59.032]  And General Eric Shinseki, who is the current Director of the Secretary of the U.S.
[02:37:59.032 --> 02:38:00.593]  Department of Veteran Affairs.
[02:38:00.593 --> 02:38:02.435]  So the two past Secretaries of the U.S.
[02:38:02.435 --> 02:38:10.763]  Department of Veteran Affairs and the last President are the officers that wrote the orders mandating medical care, immediate medical care, for DEV exposures.
[02:38:10.763 --> 02:38:12.124]  And it doesn't happen.
[02:38:12.124 --> 02:38:14.567]  And to me that's unconscionable.
[02:38:14.567 --> 02:38:18.731]  And my continuous phone calls to them meet with silence.
[02:38:19.158 --> 02:38:35.178]  Well, doctor, we see this shallow fake patriotism of salute the flag at a baseball game or football game, cry when you see the troops on TV, but then take their benefits, make them pay for their own health care, let them die at DU, shoot them up full of experimental vaccines.
[02:38:35.178 --> 02:38:37.021]  I mean, it's amazing.
[02:38:38.408 --> 02:38:54.675]  That this is still ongoing and that they know what this is doing and they're engaged in a cover-up and when the troops come in, I know you've seen this a hundred or thousand times yourself, I'd like you to speak to it, when they come in wanting medical treatment they're told, you're just mentally ill, here take some Prozac.
[02:38:54.675 --> 02:38:55.716]  That's exactly correct.
[02:38:55.716 --> 02:39:00.078]  They give them the Prozac and the psychotropic drugs and they ignore the medical problems.
[02:39:00.078 --> 02:39:05.280]  Even though they know exactly what the medical problems are and then what next we know is we've got the suicides.
[02:39:05.908 --> 02:39:09.831]  And we got the family destruction, and we've got all the crime rates and everything else.
[02:39:09.831 --> 02:39:11.512]  I'm tired of dealing with it.
[02:39:11.512 --> 02:39:18.036]  Now, once you use uranium munitions, the Army Regulation 700-48, Section 2-4, is very, very specific.
[02:39:18.036 --> 02:39:19.657]  What must be done.
[02:39:19.657 --> 02:39:23.900]  Now, this Army Regulation, I wrote, but General Eric Shinseki, who is now Secretary of the U.S.
[02:39:23.900 --> 02:39:29.103]  Department of Internal Affairs, signed off on it as a commanding general, making it mandatory.
[02:39:29.103 --> 02:39:33.466]  So what we do know must be done, wherever uranium munitions are used.
[02:39:33.466 --> 02:39:33.646]  Quote.
[02:39:35.026 --> 02:39:48.114]  As soon as exceptional risk permits, the Corps Joint Task Force Division Commander Radiation Safety Officer will identify, segregate, isolate, secure, and label all radiologic contaminated equipment.
[02:39:48.114 --> 02:39:53.797]  Procedures to minimize the spread of radioactivity will be implemented as soon as possible.
[02:39:53.797 --> 02:39:56.579]  That's every place, okay?
[02:39:56.579 --> 02:40:00.921]  We have to bring Explosives Ordnance Disposal, the explosive experts, in there.
[02:40:00.921 --> 02:40:03.623]  And during Desert Storm, EOD guys wouldn't go near it.
[02:40:04.244 --> 02:40:13.791]  I finally got three guys trained up for it, and they got killed at Camp Doha, and I still got their medals and, you know, their certificate for medals in my briefcase.
[02:40:13.791 --> 02:40:17.094]  You know, they were given posthumously, but didn't do a lot of good.
[02:40:17.094 --> 02:40:29.143]  The Explosive Ordnance Disposal Units will render all the equipment safe, because when this is used, we have incredible, incredible, not only radiological and chemical toxicities, but we have all the explosives hazards.
[02:40:29.143 --> 02:40:30.244]  So that has to be done.
[02:40:30.953 --> 02:40:34.535]  We continue on, and this comes down to everything else.
[02:40:34.535 --> 02:40:38.356]  The unit, this is all direct quote from the Army Regulation that's posted on your website.
[02:40:38.356 --> 02:40:42.318]  People can read it, and everybody in the military needs to read this and understand it.
[02:40:42.318 --> 02:40:49.642]  Every mother, father, son, sister, daughter, brother, child of anybody in the military old enough to read needs to understand this.
[02:40:49.642 --> 02:40:55.184]  Quote, the unit team, individual responsible for equipment whether friendly or foreign at that time or damaged.
[02:40:55.184 --> 02:40:58.626]  Damage is responsible for taking all action consistent with this regulation.
[02:40:59.258 --> 02:41:02.641]  And the Army pamphlet 700-48 that I also wrote.
[02:41:02.641 --> 02:41:03.382]  That's it.
[02:41:03.382 --> 02:41:04.623]  Down and dirty procedures.
[02:41:04.623 --> 02:41:07.025]  That's the cookbook of what you do.
[02:41:07.025 --> 02:41:22.500]  Uh, quote, all equipment to include capture, to combat, revitalize, and contaminate equipment will be surveyed, packaged, retrograded, and decontaminated, and then released in accordance with the technical bulletin that you cited a moment ago, 13-9, 1300-278, the pamphlet 700-48, and all the other relevant guidance that we put together.
[02:41:26.215 --> 02:41:28.377]  Safety precautions are incredible.
[02:41:28.377 --> 02:41:30.358]  I mean, they're very outlined.
[02:41:30.358 --> 02:41:32.500]  You do have a picture you can post on your website.
[02:41:32.500 --> 02:41:34.261]  I think Jared's already done that.
[02:41:34.261 --> 02:41:39.485]  Shows you the minimum equipment to use to work around this stuff and everything else.
[02:41:39.485 --> 02:41:52.856]  When we start getting down to the environmental hazards, quote, radioactive material and waste will not be locally disposed of through burial, submersion, incineration, destruction of place, or abandonment.
[02:41:52.856 --> 02:41:53.256]  End quote.
[02:41:55.103 --> 02:42:18.383]  We've contaminated not only Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the Balkans, Somalia, Afghanistan, but Vieques, Hawaii, Indiana, Florida, Nevada, California, Washington State, and the thing that bothers me the most
[02:42:19.051 --> 02:42:27.277]  And I think, you know, you've done history and everything, and I think everybody remembers the Sunday, the 18th of April, early, early man is left alive that doesn't remember what?
[02:42:27.277 --> 02:42:28.297]  Paul Revere, right?
[02:42:28.297 --> 02:42:29.358]  Yes.
[02:42:29.358 --> 02:42:35.642]  Concord, Massachusetts, where our nation was born, is one of the most highly depleted, rain-contaminated cities in the world.
[02:42:35.642 --> 02:42:42.487]  Because of the Starman plant, it is a national environmental disaster, where the military is trying to clean it up.
[02:42:42.487 --> 02:42:44.288]  Albany, New York, is also the same thing.
[02:42:44.288 --> 02:42:45.929]  Johnsboro, Tennessee, is the same thing.
[02:42:47.395 --> 02:42:53.141]  I mean, these are totally contaminated areas because of uranium munitions with incredible medical problems.
[02:42:53.141 --> 02:42:54.663]  And we see the same thing in Hawaii.
[02:42:54.663 --> 02:42:56.364]  Schofield Barracks out there in Hawaii.
[02:42:56.364 --> 02:42:57.766]  A pristine environment where the U.S.
[02:42:57.766 --> 02:43:00.288]  military did nuclear weapons testing.
[02:43:00.288 --> 02:43:04.132]  But Davy Crockett's MDU munitions, totally illegal and left to contamination.
[02:43:04.132 --> 02:43:10.499]  And now as we speak, I mean as we speak, right now, I got emailed a few minutes ago, before we came on,
[02:43:11.243 --> 02:43:13.644]  It's a mess, and they're refusing to take care of it.
[02:43:13.644 --> 02:43:15.204]  Alright, we're going to get more into this.
[02:43:15.204 --> 02:43:16.285]  I want to go to calls.
[02:43:16.285 --> 02:43:28.849]  You've got a lot more to cover, Dr. Doug Rocky, but we're going to talk to DU victims, former military and others, Danny, Dante, Noah, Jason, and others, specifically four military veterans who've been affected by this.
[02:43:28.849 --> 02:43:39.093]  You can actually hear what's happening to humanity, and then ask yourself, what type of government injects children with syphilis and smallpox and
[02:43:41.014 --> 02:43:41.894]  Polio.
[02:43:41.894 --> 02:43:48.260]  What type of government sprays nerve gas on our troops in Project Shad and tells their wives they died of the flu?
[02:43:48.260 --> 02:43:50.082]  Psychopathic killers.
[02:43:50.082 --> 02:43:53.605]  Practicing evil like a doctor practices medicine.
[02:43:53.605 --> 02:43:55.066]  What's government-run health care about?
[02:43:55.066 --> 02:43:55.807]  The death panels.
[02:43:55.807 --> 02:43:56.948]  Bill Gates now admits it.
[02:43:56.948 --> 02:43:57.969]  Newsweek cover.
[02:43:57.969 --> 02:43:59.550]  The case for killing Granny.
[02:43:59.550 --> 02:44:02.693]  Why is poison in all the major children's gums now?
[02:44:02.693 --> 02:44:04.494]  Aspartame, even in the sugar gum.
[02:44:04.494 --> 02:44:05.915]  You're being attacked, folks.
[02:44:05.915 --> 02:44:06.976]  They know what they're doing.
[02:44:08.081 --> 02:44:11.223]  Uh, Dr. Doug Wright, he's got a lot more to cover, but let's start getting to your calls now.
[02:44:11.223 --> 02:44:15.685]  Danny in Arkansas, you're on the air.
[02:44:15.685 --> 02:44:17.306]  Hey, I can barely hear you.
[02:44:17.306 --> 02:44:18.286]  Can you speak right into the phone?
[02:44:18.286 --> 02:44:23.329]  Okay, while he figures out his phone system, we're going to put Danny on hold.
[02:44:23.329 --> 02:44:24.329]  We're going to come back to him.
[02:44:24.329 --> 02:44:26.770]  I can tell he doesn't have his hands free plugged in or whatever.
[02:44:26.770 --> 02:44:27.911]  I can barely hear him.
[02:44:27.911 --> 02:44:29.552]  Dante in Jersey, you're on the air.
[02:44:35.373 --> 02:44:38.214]  Okay, what's going on is I'm not being sent the network audio.
[02:44:38.214 --> 02:44:39.015]  Okay?
[02:44:39.015 --> 02:44:40.636]  I am not receiving audio.
[02:44:40.636 --> 02:44:43.697]  So clearly... Dr. Rocky, can you hear them?
[02:44:43.697 --> 02:44:44.958]  No, I can't.
[02:44:44.958 --> 02:44:46.058]  Okay.
[02:44:46.058 --> 02:44:48.620]  We may have to get their numbers and transfer them to our phone system.
[02:44:48.620 --> 02:44:52.021]  Genesis is having an issue.
[02:44:52.021 --> 02:44:52.742]  Okay.
[02:44:52.742 --> 02:44:56.824]  Well, I can do the show, but there's no audio from these people on my end.
[02:44:57.952 --> 02:44:59.493]  Okay, I'll guarantee you that.
[02:44:59.493 --> 02:45:05.278]  Dr. Rocky, while we continue to figure this out, continue where you left off about the contamination all over the country.
[02:45:05.278 --> 02:45:08.880]  And Danny, Dante, Noah, Jason, and others, we're going to get to you.
[02:45:08.880 --> 02:45:11.122]  We have to give you our phone number here at the office.
[02:45:11.122 --> 02:45:11.482]  Go ahead.
[02:45:11.482 --> 02:45:17.627]  Okay, so what we've got is used uranium munitions in testing and manufacturing and everything else.
[02:45:17.627 --> 02:45:22.991]  And we have used uranium munitions in combat operations, which has left wholesale contamination throughout.
[02:45:23.737 --> 02:45:31.079]  Now, when we use uranium munitions against either armor or any vehicles, we shoot it up, it just totally destroys it, totally contaminates it.
[02:45:31.079 --> 02:45:39.861]  The Army regulations, again, 700-48, and the Army Common Task Train, require, require that you wear full protective equipment when you go near it.
[02:45:39.861 --> 02:45:48.563]  That's a gas mask with the HEPA filter, which is not going to do a whole lot of good, and then protective clothing, special clothing, so you don't get it out of your clothes.
[02:45:49.255 --> 02:45:52.397]  So you got all that contamination, everything that's crossed over.
[02:45:52.397 --> 02:45:56.440]  One thing that we verified, and I did this as the Director of the Depleted Uranium Project for the U.S.
[02:45:56.440 --> 02:46:05.507]  Army years after we came back from combat operations, I'd go to different army installations or facilities and I'd absolutely find the contamination there.
[02:46:05.507 --> 02:46:06.307]  It doesn't disappear.
[02:46:06.307 --> 02:46:06.948]  It doesn't go away.
[02:46:07.884 --> 02:46:17.428]  You know, one of the things that we came up recently, and again, another major lie, is that all this oil that spilled out of this rupture oil well down the Gulf somehow disappeared.
[02:46:17.428 --> 02:46:19.229]  Magically, it disappeared.
[02:46:19.229 --> 02:46:21.089]  That's pure nonsense.
[02:46:21.089 --> 02:46:24.451]  It was dispersed, or it settled out, but it's still all there.
[02:46:24.451 --> 02:46:26.411]  And it's causing a medical disaster.
[02:46:26.411 --> 02:46:28.632]  And it will cause a medical disaster.
[02:46:28.632 --> 02:46:31.634]  And that's what we have with depleted uranium.
[02:46:31.634 --> 02:46:33.274]  So we have all of that.
[02:46:33.274 --> 02:46:37.196]  When we continue on with all this stuff, the internal briefings, and again,
[02:46:38.337 --> 02:46:42.179]  I think that you've been able to post this, the Wakayama briefing.
[02:46:42.179 --> 02:46:56.008]  And J. Edgar, Colonel J. Edgar Wakayama did a briefing for the Pentagon and senior leadership prior to the start of the current individuals, you know, Operation Desert Storm led into what we know as Gulf War II.
[02:46:56.008 --> 02:46:58.569]  They totally confirmed all the health problems.
[02:46:58.569 --> 02:46:59.550]  Totally confirmed it.
[02:47:00.424 --> 02:47:20.721]  But at the same time, going back to 1991, and you've got this where you can post, I have the Los Alamos Memorandum, which was a direct order to lie in all our reports, to maintain proponency and sustain the use of uranium munitions, while avoiding all liability for the health and environmental effects.
[02:47:20.721 --> 02:47:29.288]  I mean, Alex, when you think about it, a direct order to lie, but that matches what we found now about the Simplest Tuskegee Study,
[02:47:30.234 --> 02:47:36.638]  And what has been, what, just in the last week we found out about the indefinite stuff down in Guatemala?
[02:47:36.638 --> 02:47:38.859]  It just shows how incredibly ruthless they are.
[02:47:38.859 --> 02:47:41.301]  This is not by accident from all the evidence we have.
[02:47:41.301 --> 02:47:45.984]  This is a program of eugenics and population reduction.
[02:47:45.984 --> 02:47:56.370]  Yeah, I mean, you know, one of the things that I learned in the military for 40 years and I had to come to grips with it is when I really learned what we do and how we deal with it, what decisions do I have to make?
[02:47:57.689 --> 02:48:01.490]  Uh, and you come up to the ethical and moral domain.
[02:48:01.490 --> 02:48:03.111]  You know, we have to do what's right.
[02:48:03.111 --> 02:48:05.231]  We can't allow the use of this stuff anymore.
[02:48:05.231 --> 02:48:07.232]  We have to clean up the environment.
[02:48:07.232 --> 02:48:09.333]  We have to provide the medical care.
[02:48:09.333 --> 02:48:11.333]  And so when I wrote the requirements for the U.S.
[02:48:11.333 --> 02:48:25.317]  military, and we did the research for them, and wrote the requirements, they have to understand the Army Regulations, 748, the pamphlet, the modification to the 1990 version of TV, 1913, 102, 78, 1996 version.
[02:48:25.317 --> 02:48:27.118]  Uh, we did that all based on solid knowledge.
[02:48:28.266 --> 02:48:35.687]  And so, what you'll see today, and I had an inquiry earlier today from Europe, and they were saying, well, they're still saying we need more research, we don't know.
[02:48:35.687 --> 02:48:36.828]  Wait a minute.
[02:48:36.828 --> 02:48:46.609]  The Army regulation requiring thorough environmental remediation and medical care, the orders for medical care, have already been written.
[02:48:46.609 --> 02:48:51.370]  That's because the decision was made, this stuff is so nasty, we can't use it.
[02:48:51.370 --> 02:48:53.571]  And once we do use it, we have to provide the medical care.
[02:48:53.571 --> 02:48:54.971]  You know, but they just totally ignore it.
[02:48:55.839 --> 02:48:59.660]  So we look at all of these incredible, incredible things.
[02:48:59.660 --> 02:49:01.781]  Air, water, soil and food contamination.
[02:49:01.781 --> 02:49:03.702]  Water contamination.
[02:49:03.702 --> 02:49:09.223]  In Europe now, one of the concerns we have is the contamination from the Middle East is getting up into Europe.
[02:49:09.223 --> 02:49:11.804]  It's going to affect the milk and water supplies.
[02:49:11.804 --> 02:49:12.844]  It's going to get in the food stream.
[02:49:12.844 --> 02:49:14.365]  It's going to get right in the whole food stream.
[02:49:14.365 --> 02:49:18.266]  We absolutely know the contamination has reached from the Middle East.
[02:49:18.266 --> 02:49:21.387]  That's Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia.
[02:49:21.387 --> 02:49:23.908]  We absolutely know it's reached Northern Europe and into Great Britain.
[02:49:25.495 --> 02:49:28.796]  We know the contamination throughout the United States has transferred all over.
[02:49:28.796 --> 02:49:33.318]  We know the contamination from Vieques, Puerto Rico, reached the main island of Puerto Rico.
[02:49:33.318 --> 02:49:44.462]  That's right, they've got radiation testing facilities all over the world, and every time a new war kicks up, the testing facilities in England and others pick it up that far away, because the jet streams carry that stuff around and around the world.
[02:49:44.462 --> 02:49:48.583]  Yeah, when I was down in Vieques, we were doing the investigation on Vieques, Puerto Rico just some years ago.
[02:49:50.044 --> 02:49:55.825]  Obviously, you know, they were concerned, and they asked me to come down there, and I started working with them, and God bless those guys down in Vieques.
[02:49:55.825 --> 02:50:01.587]  I mean, Bob Ribbon, Nelda Medino, I mean, these are incredible people that have been trying to do their work.
[02:50:01.587 --> 02:50:11.469]  We were literally airborne, and the military was firing this stuff on the range on Vieques, and we're watching the clouds come up from the range where they're firing it, going over to the main island of Puerto Rico.
[02:50:11.469 --> 02:50:12.829]  We just literally watched it from the air.
[02:50:16.055 --> 02:50:22.117]  Well, we have opened up our phone lines because of audio issues or whatever it is.
[02:50:22.117 --> 02:50:25.519]  We're getting Danny, Dante, Noah, Jason, and others.
[02:50:25.519 --> 02:50:29.080]  Only military callers or families of military affected by DU.
[02:50:29.080 --> 02:50:33.562]  We're going to take your calls non-stop in this next segment and right through into the next hour.
[02:50:33.562 --> 02:50:35.463]  This is important information.
[02:50:35.463 --> 02:50:37.904]  The toll-free number if you're specifically on this issue.
[02:50:38.604 --> 02:50:40.806]  And have been victimized by this or denied care.
[02:50:40.806 --> 02:50:43.909]  888-201-2244.
[02:50:43.909 --> 02:50:46.191]  Jason in Germany and others, give us a call.
[02:50:46.191 --> 02:50:46.491]  Back 888-201-2244.
[02:50:46.491 --> 02:50:48.052]  We will get you up and on the air.
[02:50:48.052 --> 02:50:48.152]  888-201-2244.
[02:50:48.152 --> 02:50:48.713]  Stay with us.
[02:50:48.713 --> 02:50:51.415]  We'll be right back with Dr. Doug Rocky, Dr. D.U.
[02:51:01.488 --> 02:51:05.569]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:05.569 --> 02:51:10.071]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:51:10.071 --> 02:51:16.232]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:51:16.232 --> 02:51:18.673]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:51:18.673 --> 02:51:24.635]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:24.755 --> 02:51:28.180]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:51:28.180 --> 02:51:30.042]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:51:30.042 --> 02:51:32.225]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[02:51:32.225 --> 02:51:37.112]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[02:51:37.112 --> 02:51:37.933]  Guaranteed.
[02:51:37.933 --> 02:51:41.979]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[02:51:42.199 --> 02:51:47.004]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.
[02:51:47.004 --> 02:51:48.165]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[02:51:48.165 --> 02:51:48.886]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[02:52:00.876 --> 02:52:03.278]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:03.278 --> 02:52:05.599]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:05.599 --> 02:52:08.802]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:08.802 --> 02:52:13.905]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:13.905 --> 02:52:18.108]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.408 --> 02:52:20.771]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:20.771 --> 02:52:23.655]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:23.655 --> 02:52:26.579]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:26.579 --> 02:52:34.169]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.508 --> 02:52:39.893]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:39.893 --> 02:52:42.216]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:42.216 --> 02:52:46.440]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:46.440 --> 02:52:47.501]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:47.501 --> 02:52:48.842]  You're everyone else.
[02:52:48.842 --> 02:52:50.343]  Invisible Empire.

[02:52:59.901 --> 02:53:01.261]  This may surprise you.
[02:53:01.261 --> 02:53:05.722]  Type 2 diabetes has reached epidemic proportions among both adults and children.
[02:53:05.722 --> 02:53:07.562]  You or someone you know may have it.
[02:53:07.562 --> 02:53:11.303]  Managing type 2 diabetes in conventional ways is a never-ending task.
[02:53:11.303 --> 02:53:13.884]  But this good news may also surprise you.
[02:53:13.884 --> 02:53:19.425]  A recent UCLA study proved that type 2 diabetes can be reversed in only 21 days.
[02:53:19.425 --> 02:53:26.886]  Puriam Health Products recently developed a product that mimics the healthy diet used in that UCLA study called Scoop of Greens, an easy
[02:53:26.966 --> 02:53:32.330]  Great tasting, affordable way to give your body the nutritional tools to help it overcome type 2 diabetes.
[02:53:32.330 --> 02:53:37.274]  Scoop of Greens has been awarded the Diabetes Resource Center Seal of Approval so you know it's safe.

[02:54:06.733 --> 02:54:09.334]  Okay, we're gonna try to figure out what's going on with this audio gremlin.
[02:54:09.334 --> 02:54:11.995]  Everybody's doing a great job on our side and Genesis.
[02:54:11.995 --> 02:54:14.736]  Stuff rarely happens, but I apologize to the callers.
[02:54:14.736 --> 02:54:18.937]  Let's go to Danny in Arkansas, the first caller we couldn't really hear.
[02:54:18.937 --> 02:54:20.178]  Danny, welcome sir.
[02:54:22.895 --> 02:54:24.095]  Thanks Alex, can you hear me?
[02:54:24.095 --> 02:54:26.756]  Yes I can hear you, go ahead.
[02:54:26.756 --> 02:54:29.377]  I have a question for Dr. Rocky.
[02:54:29.377 --> 02:54:42.300]  I went to basic training in AIT at Fort Leonard Wood up in Missouri and where we used to always do our road marches and everything was right next to this big field where we would sit there and watch the A-10 Warthogs come in, blow up the tanks.
[02:54:44.332 --> 02:54:55.656]  And we were walking right next to it, and then after I got out of the army in about 97, right after that I was diagnosed with sarcoidosis.
[02:54:55.656 --> 02:54:56.497]  Diagnosed with what?
[02:54:56.497 --> 02:55:00.118]  Would that be related to the depleted uranium?
[02:55:00.118 --> 02:55:02.219]  What was the diagnosis?
[02:55:02.219 --> 02:55:07.761]  It was non-satiating granulomas, and they called it sarcoidosis.
[02:55:11.054 --> 02:55:19.540]  It would swell up my lymph tissue around my lungs and made it where I couldn't breathe, basically.
[02:55:19.540 --> 02:55:21.462]  Nobody could ever tell me what it was.
[02:55:21.462 --> 02:55:29.247]  I thought it was the chemtrails, but you were on before and you said that they have respiratory illnesses and I was wondering if that could have been...
[02:55:33.018 --> 02:55:36.700]  How much to each one of those warthog bullets weigh, sir?
[02:55:36.700 --> 02:55:41.904]  Three quarters of a pound and 4,000 rounds per minute when they're fired with DEU.
[02:55:41.904 --> 02:55:48.808]  The calcified granulomas and everything in the lungs is exactly what's happened to me, taken out 40% of my respiratory.
[02:55:48.808 --> 02:55:56.633]  Again, that was totally confirmed and totally acknowledged as far back as 1973 and 1974 after the Israelis used it against the Egyptians.
[02:55:56.633 --> 02:55:58.494]  That's where I used that medical evidence.
[02:55:59.654 --> 02:56:07.677]  And so that's a death sentence to have them march around a proving ground while warthogs with their Vulcan cannons blow the daylights out of old tanks?
[02:56:19.329 --> 02:56:22.191]  Is there anything Danny can do for this attack on his lungs?
[02:56:40.219 --> 02:56:42.000]  Well yeah, he just goes back to the U.S.
[02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:50.642]  Department of Veteran Affairs and Dr. Victoria Cassano, who is the Director of Environmental Services for the VA, she has copies of all the orders and regulations.
[02:56:50.642 --> 02:56:55.324]  She understands that because I've faxed everything directly to her staff and I've talked to her personally.
[02:56:55.324 --> 02:56:58.765]  And they're required to give him medical care, full medical care.
[02:56:58.765 --> 02:57:04.627]  The respiratory effects from DE were confirmed and confirmed in the Wakayama briefing and confirmed in everything else.
[02:57:04.867 --> 02:57:08.070]  And we're posting all those documents at Infowars.com.
[02:57:08.070 --> 02:57:10.612]  Does that answer your question, Danny?
[02:57:10.612 --> 02:57:11.372]  That does.
[02:57:11.372 --> 02:57:13.074]  That gives me somewhere to start.
[02:57:13.074 --> 02:57:17.717]  I've always wondered what it was, where it came from, and now I know where to start.
[02:57:17.717 --> 02:57:20.620]  Nobody else would ever have any information on it.
[02:57:20.620 --> 02:57:21.500]  God bless you, sir.
[02:57:21.500 --> 02:57:25.063]  Let's talk to Jason in Deutschland, joining us from Germany.
[02:57:25.063 --> 02:57:25.864]  Jason, go ahead.
[02:57:25.864 --> 02:57:27.846]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:57:27.846 --> 02:57:28.346]  Can you hear me?
[02:57:28.346 --> 02:57:28.626]  Good.
[02:57:28.626 --> 02:57:28.946]  Yes, sir.
[02:57:28.946 --> 02:57:29.267]  Go ahead.
[02:57:30.393 --> 02:57:32.335]  Hey, just a little background first.
[02:57:32.335 --> 02:57:46.345]  I was in a mechanized infantry battalion in Desert Storm and we were involved in combat and we used quite a bit of the DU rounds and we used them out of the Bradley guns because they were so effective.
[02:57:46.345 --> 02:57:53.691]  We found that out very quick and coming up now on the 20th anniversary of it, we're trying to arrange a get-together.
[02:57:54.662 --> 02:57:59.586]  And through various social networking sites and what have you, we're trying to get in contact with everybody who's in the unit.
[02:57:59.586 --> 02:58:04.910]  And what we're finding out is about 20, 25, 30 percent of the guys are already dead.
[02:58:04.910 --> 02:58:12.436]  And they've died of upper respiratory, lung, digestive problems, cancers and what have you.
[02:58:12.436 --> 02:58:15.278]  And, you know, I don't think you can take any population.
[02:58:16.357 --> 02:58:17.097]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.144 --> 02:58:48.065]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:48.065 --> 02:58:55.368]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[02:58:55.368 --> 02:58:56.649]  Tyranny is here.
[02:58:56.649 --> 02:59:00.510]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:59:00.510 --> 02:59:02.812]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:59:02.812 --> 02:59:08.674]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:59:08.674 --> 02:59:14.917]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:59:15.337 --> 02:59:21.281]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:59:21.281 --> 02:59:25.484]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:59:25.484 --> 02:59:29.767]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:59:29.767 --> 02:59:35.732]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:59:35.732 --> 02:59:39.274]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:59:39.274 --> 02:59:41.255]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:59:41.255 --> 02:59:41.696]  It's here.
[02:59:42.336 --> 02:59:48.683]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:00:07.660 --> 03:00:09.621]  We're doing a test today.
[03:00:09.621 --> 03:00:10.941]  We're live into the fourth hour.
[03:00:10.941 --> 03:00:18.323]  PrisonPlanet.tv members can always watch the full radio show live and see the archives at PrisonPlanet.tv, not just the free audio streams.
[03:00:18.323 --> 03:00:22.084]  But today we're doing this fourth hour free video streaming.
[03:00:22.084 --> 03:00:25.365]  The link just went live at InfoWars.com if you want to see what goes on.
[03:00:27.427 --> 03:00:31.651]  We're testing it for the 24-hour plus live broadcast coming up Thursday.
[03:00:31.651 --> 03:00:39.119]  We're going to attempt, if our servers can handle it, to broadcast the entire 24-plus hour transmission at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:00:39.119 --> 03:00:46.046]  Now, going back to Dr. Doug Rocky, hearing Jason in Germany, who we're going back to in a moment, where he said over 20% of his unit
[03:00:48.348 --> 03:00:54.836]  And they were 20-something years old when they were there just 20 years ago, or 19 years ago, are dead.
[03:00:54.836 --> 03:00:57.359]  And that's the numbers you've gotten from the VA.
[03:00:57.359 --> 03:00:58.200]  That's very similar.
[03:00:58.200 --> 03:01:03.105]  So this is what the globalists think of the troops that serve.
[03:01:03.105 --> 03:01:03.986]  And don't forget,
[03:01:04.847 --> 03:01:09.431]  In all tyrannies, they hate their military and police the most, and they want to decommission you.
[03:01:09.431 --> 03:01:18.719]  So they love the fact that you're using soft kill weapons so after you get out and are older and become wiser, but have combat experience, you're so debilitated you can't resist their takeover.
[03:01:18.719 --> 03:01:21.821]  Dr. Rocky, what's it like hearing this from Jason?
[03:01:21.821 --> 03:01:23.943]  Well, he's just confirming again what we already know.
[03:01:23.943 --> 03:01:28.387]  The United States Department of Veterans Affairs publishes the Gulf War Veterans Information System Report.
[03:01:29.387 --> 03:01:32.208]  They quit publishing them back in 2008.
[03:01:32.208 --> 03:01:42.632]  In 2008, the number of Desert Storm, in 2008, that's two years ago, over two and a half years ago, that have died, was at 78,559.
[03:01:42.632 --> 03:01:43.773]  That's over two years ago.
[03:01:43.773 --> 03:01:45.794]  Now, the numbers are continuously going up.
[03:01:45.794 --> 03:01:53.237]  If you watch the ArmyTimes.com website or any other military, you realize these kids are dropping dead on a daily basis.
[03:01:53.237 --> 03:01:57.738]  When we looked at the total number, we had 78,000 from Operation Desert Storm.
[03:01:59.821 --> 03:02:01.082]  No, we're going to go back again.
[03:02:01.082 --> 03:02:10.970]  Two years ago, two years ago, the VA reported 1,129,340 individuals had gone over to Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom.
[03:02:10.970 --> 03:02:27.462]  As of February of 2008, that's two years ago, the number that had died of the people that went into the Gulf with Desert Storm 2, or you know, we call it Gulf War 2, Iraqi Freedom 9, or Iraqi Enduring Freedom,
[03:02:29.404 --> 03:02:36.245]  Is 170,408 have died.
[03:02:36.245 --> 03:02:36.445]  170,000.
[03:02:36.445 --> 03:02:39.906]  Now we know those numbers have gone way up.
[03:02:39.906 --> 03:02:41.926]  We know that the medical reports from the U.S.
[03:02:41.926 --> 03:02:45.507]  Department of Veterans Affairs for Operation Desert Storm have over 300,000.
[03:02:45.507 --> 03:02:47.487]  That's over 40%.
[03:02:47.487 --> 03:02:49.767]  Now we have serious medical problems.
[03:02:49.767 --> 03:02:58.569]  We know from Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom that we're looking at close to 50% have also very serious medical problems.
[03:02:59.218 --> 03:03:03.782]  Well, I mean, throughout the last two decades, I've heard from various contacts of guys who've had other problems with rashes,
[03:03:21.870 --> 03:03:26.313]  And, you know, persistent diarrhea, and we're talking like, you know, years-long diarrhea.
[03:03:26.313 --> 03:03:39.023]  And, you know, you kind of blew it off, I guess, because, you know, you're a lot younger, but now when you're confronted with these numbers face-on when you're trying to organize a reunion, it's pretty shocking.
[03:03:39.023 --> 03:03:49.430]  Yeah, when you're 18 or 20, when you're 18 or 20 or 22 and you think you're bulletproof, and most young men think that, you know, they love using you, they knew full well what they were doing.
[03:03:49.430 --> 03:03:49.731]  Go ahead.
[03:03:50.984 --> 03:03:54.025]  Yeah, I mean, we used this stuff extensively.
[03:03:54.025 --> 03:03:55.166]  I said it at the beginning.
[03:03:55.166 --> 03:03:58.967]  I mean, we fired off, I don't even remember, I mean, thousands of these rounds.
[03:03:58.967 --> 03:04:00.308]  I mean, they were so effective.
[03:04:00.308 --> 03:04:05.150]  And then we had that choice, our HE rounds, and everybody knew which ones, you know, destroyed the Iraqi tanks.
[03:04:05.150 --> 03:04:06.250]  So, you know, we used it.
[03:04:06.250 --> 03:04:10.912]  And, you know, you got out, you would dismount the Bradleys, and you would clear an area after the fact.
[03:04:10.912 --> 03:04:14.074]  And, you know, you weren't even thinking about, you know, what you might be breathing in back then.
[03:04:15.146 --> 03:04:17.808]  Now you find out that all your friends are dead.
[03:04:17.808 --> 03:04:22.130]  And it's very, very shocking and very discouraging that this is denied by the U.S.
[03:04:22.130 --> 03:04:24.231]  government, or at least ignored.
[03:04:24.231 --> 03:04:26.672]  I'm hearing the same numbers out of the same 82nd Airborne.
[03:04:26.672 --> 03:04:30.354]  My own cousin was a combat medic in the 82nd Airborne.
[03:04:30.354 --> 03:04:33.796]  And again, they're also trying to put together, just like you said, a reunion.
[03:04:33.796 --> 03:04:35.337]  And he's coming up with 15 to 20% of his units all dead.
[03:04:37.842 --> 03:04:39.143]  That's what we're running into.
[03:04:39.143 --> 03:04:41.245]  It's disgusting.
[03:04:41.245 --> 03:04:57.477]  Jason, Jason, I want to let you finish up on the other side briefly with what this makes you think about this government and who's running this and your warning to other military and police that serve the New World Order, satanic world government system and there's no other way to describe it.
[03:04:57.477 --> 03:04:59.038]  If this isn't the devil, I don't know what is.
[03:04:59.038 --> 03:05:00.439]  We'll be back with more of your calls.

[03:06:06.670 --> 03:06:10.474]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:06:10.474 --> 03:06:12.836]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:06:12.836 --> 03:06:18.702]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:06:18.702 --> 03:06:24.928]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[03:06:25.348 --> 03:06:31.353]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:06:31.353 --> 03:06:35.516]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.

[03:06:45.745 --> 03:06:49.308]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:06:49.308 --> 03:06:51.289]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:06:51.289 --> 03:06:51.730]  It's here.

[03:08:14.292 --> 03:08:16.013]  Historic, we've never done anything like this.
[03:08:16.013 --> 03:08:19.075]  We're going to kick off on Thursday at 11 a.m.
[03:08:19.075 --> 03:08:19.976]  Central.
[03:08:19.976 --> 03:08:24.419]  We are testing, giving PrisonPlanet.tv for free for folks.
[03:08:24.419 --> 03:08:26.141]  We couldn't afford it every day, but for 24 hours plus.
[03:08:27.822 --> 03:08:30.305]  So we've got, we're testing our CDN servers right now.

[03:09:03.292 --> 03:09:04.053]  I don't know.
[03:09:18.686 --> 03:09:27.656]  That it's, you know, the cancers in the lungs, the respiratory problems, the urinary tract where it precipitates out and bioaccumulates, the kidney failure.
[03:09:27.656 --> 03:09:34.304]  And I was asking Jason, and we're going to go to other callers, what is it like to know that they knew
[03:09:35.402 --> 03:09:39.183]  Specifically, and that they're just giving you a sentence of death.
[03:09:39.183 --> 03:09:41.604]  You know, what does that say about the people running this thing?
[03:09:41.604 --> 03:09:44.905]  Of course they're going to take your mortgage, even though you've paid it off and steal your house.
[03:09:44.905 --> 03:09:51.707]  Of course they're going to take six million, you know, dying veterans' death benefits from their families, Bloomberg, reporting on it.
[03:09:51.707 --> 03:09:52.767]  Of course they're going to inject
[03:09:53.727 --> 03:09:54.228]  We're good to go.
[03:10:14.910 --> 03:10:16.851]  He admits he guzzles Diet Coke.
[03:10:16.851 --> 03:10:19.232]  The government even admits it makes people go blind.
[03:10:19.232 --> 03:10:25.155]  And then his show today, the fill-in host was reportedly making fun of us as we're trying to lovingly warn him and others.
[03:10:25.155 --> 03:10:27.076]  That they just like, I want to die.
[03:10:27.076 --> 03:10:28.216]  I want to breathe DU.
[03:10:28.216 --> 03:10:29.597]  I want to form babies.
[03:10:29.597 --> 03:10:31.358]  You know, I want all this.
[03:10:31.358 --> 03:10:33.179]  I want to be cursed.
[03:10:33.179 --> 03:10:34.379]  I'm a giggling yuppie.
[03:10:34.379 --> 03:10:35.240]  It's not funny!
[03:10:36.730 --> 03:10:43.055]  Over 20% of their unit, who are like 40 years old now, from Desert Storm 191, dead.
[03:10:43.055 --> 03:10:44.377]  Jason, finish up your point.
[03:10:44.377 --> 03:10:46.598]  What's your view on this?
[03:10:46.598 --> 03:10:48.980]  Yeah, hey, I'm totally with you there, Alex.
[03:10:48.980 --> 03:10:54.705]  I mean, they chip away at the stone, and before you know it, a huge chunk is missing, and it's there for everyone to see.
[03:10:54.705 --> 03:10:56.247]  I mean, you know, I took a note.
[03:10:57.268 --> 03:11:00.831]  And now we know why for five years they've been quietly, more than that, but for five
[03:11:20.845 --> 03:11:33.277]  You're setting up all of Homeland Security to fight veterans that are going to, quote, bomb police stations, because they're going to stage terror attacks and blame it on vets, but there are also going to be mad vets that are going to come after the government.
[03:11:33.277 --> 03:11:34.958]  But why would they go after police departments?
[03:11:34.958 --> 03:11:43.246]  They're trying to get the police organized against veterans now, as all these internal Homeland Security reports that we've gotten from law enforcement show, you are the enemy.
[03:11:43.246 --> 03:11:44.827]  Doesn't that make perfect sense?
[03:11:44.827 --> 03:11:46.429]  Dr. Doug Rockey, your comments on that.
[03:11:48.163 --> 03:11:49.004]  I don't even want to go there.
[03:11:49.004 --> 03:11:55.950]  I have to understand, I've been training and involved with law enforcement my entire life, and they're my brothers and my sisters.
[03:11:55.950 --> 03:11:59.433]  They're being wasted too, because the training they've been given is ineffective.
[03:11:59.433 --> 03:12:01.775]  The equipment they've been given is ineffective.
[03:12:01.775 --> 03:12:03.837]  And all you have to do is look at the confirmation.
[03:12:03.837 --> 03:12:12.545]  My buddies, my brothers, my friends, my students, that went to the World Trade Center on 9-1-1 for the New York Police Department and the New York Fire Department are sick and dead.
[03:12:13.456 --> 03:12:21.985]  And they're dying and they're fighting for medical care and I mean the stories in the news media again this last week is, well this is what we're offering you guys, take it or leave it.
[03:12:21.985 --> 03:12:22.486]  My God.
[03:12:22.486 --> 03:12:23.407]  My God.
[03:12:23.407 --> 03:12:24.528]  My God.
[03:12:24.528 --> 03:12:28.953]  But we understand why the government's trying to gear up against vets because they know the vets are waking up.
[03:12:28.953 --> 03:12:34.579]  What's the attitude of the former soldiers that you valiantly fought with, Jason?
[03:12:34.579 --> 03:12:35.260]  Are they getting angry?
[03:12:36.331 --> 03:12:37.452]  Yeah, of course they are.
[03:12:37.452 --> 03:12:39.493]  These are infantry guys.
[03:12:39.493 --> 03:12:41.935]  They're a pretty patriotic bunch to begin with.
[03:12:41.935 --> 03:12:48.219]  We all joined for our own reasons in college or whatever, but there's a streak of patriotism in every single one of them.
[03:12:48.219 --> 03:12:53.203]  Some guys it's more than others and some of them hold on to it a little bit longer, but there's a frustration there.
[03:12:54.023 --> 03:12:55.323]  The ear is there now, too.
[03:12:55.323 --> 03:12:59.504]  I mean, everybody's listening and everybody's beginning to give credit to arguments like yours.
[03:12:59.504 --> 03:13:01.305]  You're gaining ground, man.
[03:13:01.305 --> 03:13:04.085]  And it's a great job that you're doing, and the doctor as well.
[03:13:04.085 --> 03:13:06.265]  Well, we've got to... God bless you, Jason.
[03:13:06.265 --> 03:13:07.746]  We've got to gain ground.
[03:13:07.746 --> 03:13:15.647]  You think my children are safe in a country, in a world run by people that would march their own troops into clouds of DU knowing it's a death sentence?
[03:13:15.647 --> 03:13:17.168]  You think any of us are safe?
[03:13:17.168 --> 03:13:18.628]  This is just the stuff we know about.
[03:13:18.948 --> 03:13:19.248]  That's it.
[03:13:19.248 --> 03:13:19.848]  Sums it up completely.
[03:13:45.523 --> 03:13:47.164]  I mean, we got some more vets on the phone?
[03:13:47.164 --> 03:13:47.604]  Yes, sir.
[03:13:47.604 --> 03:13:48.224]  Let's take them.
[03:13:48.224 --> 03:13:49.105]  Noah in Texas.
[03:13:49.105 --> 03:13:49.765]  You're on the air.
[03:13:49.765 --> 03:13:52.726]  I'll call.
[03:13:52.726 --> 03:13:53.306]  Can you hear me?
[03:13:53.306 --> 03:13:53.787]  Yes, I can.
[03:13:53.787 --> 03:13:55.307]  Go ahead.
[03:13:55.307 --> 03:13:57.708]  I just want to bring everyone's attention to just two things.
[03:13:57.708 --> 03:13:59.229]  First of all, I'm an ex-Marine.
[03:13:59.229 --> 03:14:14.396]  I served in artillery from 1996 to 1998, and I have an 11-year-old autistic daughter, and I want everyone to Google this news article, Military Parents Battle the System to Help Autistic Children
[03:14:15.106 --> 03:14:28.108]  Because at the end of the second paragraph, it says, according to Defense Department data, the military has double the rate of autism in the civilian world.
[03:14:28.108 --> 03:14:30.669]  Dr. Rocky, we know what's happening to children.
[03:14:30.669 --> 03:14:31.749]  It's all there.
[03:14:31.749 --> 03:14:39.330]  I mean, when we look at the Department of Veterans Affairs' acknowledgment, again, it says very, quote, the effects on the children whose parents were exposed.
[03:14:39.330 --> 03:14:43.571]  So we're seeing all these toxic exposures affecting the neural, affecting all the RNA, DNA.
[03:14:44.332 --> 03:14:45.732]  And we're seeing all the birth defects.
[03:14:45.732 --> 03:14:46.413]  Not only U.S.
[03:14:46.413 --> 03:14:49.613]  military children, but the children around the world were infected.
[03:14:49.613 --> 03:14:50.774]  That's a given.
[03:14:50.774 --> 03:14:53.094]  It's an absolute given.
[03:14:53.094 --> 03:15:02.297]  And what we have learned also is when military personnel start yelling and screaming about their children, if they yell and scream too loud, man, they're dumped so fast, make your head spin.
[03:15:04.972 --> 03:15:07.175]  Anything else?
[03:15:07.175 --> 03:15:09.097]  Yes sir, I wanted to make one other point.
[03:15:09.097 --> 03:15:18.770]  On November 17th, George W. Bush is going to be giving a speech at the University of North Texas and I hope a lot of people show up and protest with me there.
[03:15:23.493 --> 03:15:24.294]  God bless you, sir.
[03:15:24.294 --> 03:15:26.055]  I appreciate your call.
[03:15:26.055 --> 03:15:34.942]  Boy, it's hard to take these calls, but it's important to put this out there so everybody really understands just how serious this situation is.
[03:15:34.942 --> 03:15:39.927]  Who's been holding the longest after Noah, guys?
[03:15:39.927 --> 03:15:41.688]  Joe in California, another veteran.
[03:15:41.688 --> 03:15:44.230]  Joe, you're on the air with Dr. Doug Rockey.
[03:15:44.230 --> 03:15:45.451]  Yes.
[03:15:45.451 --> 03:15:49.334]  I was a combat veteran in Desert Storm, the first one.
[03:15:49.334 --> 03:15:52.157]  Hello?
[03:15:52.157 --> 03:15:52.297]  Yes.
[03:15:53.693 --> 03:15:55.574]  Uh, yeah, and this is very important.
[03:15:55.574 --> 03:15:59.816]  You need to ask these veterans, were they field vaccinated?
[03:15:59.816 --> 03:16:03.118]  Oh yeah, wow!
[03:16:03.118 --> 03:16:06.339]  I mean, all my unit, they were field vaccinated.
[03:16:06.339 --> 03:16:09.101]  We were forced to shoot ourselves right through the uniform.
[03:16:09.101 --> 03:16:14.143]  We'd break the needle, shoot yourself through the uniform with a field vaccination.
[03:16:14.143 --> 03:16:16.044]  All my unit got sick.
[03:16:16.044 --> 03:16:20.346]  All their kids, the kids that were born afterwards, are messed up.
[03:16:21.315 --> 03:16:25.999]  I did not get the vaccination and my kid is normal.
[03:16:25.999 --> 03:16:27.800]  This is completely the U.S.
[03:16:27.800 --> 03:16:35.266]  Department of Veteran Affairs and the report issued by Jim Benz is November two years ago.
[03:16:35.266 --> 03:16:38.008]  Again, totally confirmed all the health picture of the immunizations.
[03:16:38.008 --> 03:16:38.888]  This is well known.
[03:16:38.888 --> 03:16:42.591]  The immunizations we're talking about, not only from the antiretrovirals.
[03:16:42.591 --> 03:16:43.932]  Oh yeah, now here's another point.
[03:16:43.932 --> 03:16:45.834]  I used depleted uranium
[03:16:46.796 --> 03:16:49.177]  And, you know, I was very careful.
[03:16:49.177 --> 03:16:53.659]  I was not trying to target kids or civilians, right?
[03:16:53.659 --> 03:17:04.484]  But now I read a report after I get back that the kids and the women are going and picking up the radioactive shrapnel and getting poisoned by it.
[03:17:04.484 --> 03:17:08.405]  It's still there, totally contaminated air, water, and soil in all the children.
[03:17:08.405 --> 03:17:12.067]  We get down in Fallujah, we get down in Bostra, the medical report coming out of Bostra,
[03:17:12.873 --> 03:17:13.654]  Not only for the U.S.
[03:17:13.654 --> 03:17:17.598]  military there during Desert Storm, but the military that are coming out of there currently.
[03:17:17.598 --> 03:17:18.359]  And it's civilians.
[03:17:18.359 --> 03:17:19.580]  It's a medical disaster.
[03:17:19.580 --> 03:17:28.289]  And I've talked to the physicians there and actually spoke at world conferences, the United Nations, and all over Europe with the physicians out of Basra.
[03:17:28.289 --> 03:17:28.749]  You're right.
[03:17:28.749 --> 03:17:30.831]  It's a complete, total disaster.
[03:17:30.831 --> 03:17:33.134]  And just because you didn't target them doesn't mean it.
[03:17:33.134 --> 03:17:35.176]  Because once it's there, it's there until it's removed.
[03:17:36.209 --> 03:17:38.751]  It stays there forever, and you can't really clean it up.
[03:17:38.751 --> 03:17:42.154]  That's what I found out when I wrote army regulations at 748.
[03:17:42.154 --> 03:17:49.980]  That's why I told them they can't use it anymore, and that was the end of my life as far as the military was concerned.
[03:17:49.980 --> 03:17:50.661]  Well said.
[03:17:50.661 --> 03:18:02.290]  I appreciate being able to have, you know, my voice heard after, you know, 20 years of coming back from Iraq and finding out, you know, I did it for oil.
[03:18:02.290 --> 03:18:03.631]  I did it for the big oil.
[03:18:05.816 --> 03:18:13.918]  Well, you also did it for world government and they hate our veterans because they know you're good men and women and that's why they soft kill you.
[03:18:13.918 --> 03:18:20.781]  But hopefully we can get this out to the young people and they won't join so they can be basically experimented on and slow killed.
[03:18:20.781 --> 03:18:22.081]  Thank you so much, Joe.
[03:18:22.081 --> 03:18:23.842]  Bullseye in Texas, another veteran.
[03:18:23.842 --> 03:18:26.782]  You're on the air with Dr. Doug Rocky.
[03:18:26.782 --> 03:18:27.803]  Yeah, how you doing, Alex?
[03:18:27.803 --> 03:18:28.963]  Good.
[03:18:28.963 --> 03:18:30.804]  Pleasure to be speaking with you.
[03:18:30.804 --> 03:18:35.045]  I was in Northern Iraq through Turkey in Operation Provide Comfort.
[03:18:36.041 --> 03:18:37.843]  I was in an Apache helicopter unit.
[03:18:37.843 --> 03:18:43.409]  We got there about a week after the American Marines ran the Iraqis out.
[03:18:43.409 --> 03:18:50.896]  We moved directly into the buildings that the Marines, you know, bombed and shot up, chasing the Iraqi Army out.
[03:18:50.896 --> 03:18:54.480]  And we lived in those buildings for six months.
[03:18:54.480 --> 03:18:58.164]  Did anybody warn you, sir, about how deadly that was?
[03:18:59.514 --> 03:19:01.315]  No, no, absolutely not.
[03:19:01.315 --> 03:19:03.377]  We didn't hear anything about it.
[03:19:03.377 --> 03:19:09.280]  About 30 days after I arrived there, I developed a nice, wonderful case of diarrhea.
[03:19:09.280 --> 03:19:12.622]  And I still... We all got that.
[03:19:12.622 --> 03:19:14.343]  I still got that today.
[03:19:14.343 --> 03:19:15.484]  I still carry that today.
[03:19:15.484 --> 03:19:17.105]  You'll have that for the rest of your life.
[03:19:17.105 --> 03:19:27.892]  I mean, what's happening, again, the Department of Veteran Affairs here at State's very specifically, in the Clinician's Guide for DU, that explosive diarrhea is one of the exact medical problems from the exposures.
[03:19:30.177 --> 03:19:31.798]  I'm not surprised.
[03:19:31.798 --> 03:19:35.241]  They've got me at 100% disability now.
[03:19:35.241 --> 03:19:41.907]  I'd like to jump forward 10 years to 2001, where I got a letter in the mail from the VA.
[03:19:41.907 --> 03:19:44.049]  This is kind of... Okay.
[03:19:44.049 --> 03:19:48.313]  They wanted me to come in for a PTSD screening.
[03:19:48.313 --> 03:19:52.416]  I never showed any signs or anything, but they were screening everybody back then.
[03:19:52.416 --> 03:19:54.038]  It was a big George Bush thing, I think.
[03:19:54.038 --> 03:19:56.480]  It's all about veterans on the street.
[03:19:56.480 --> 03:19:56.740]  Anyway.
[03:19:57.799 --> 03:20:04.582]  I go on the screen and the guy talks to me for 20 minutes and sends me home with Prozac.
[03:20:04.582 --> 03:20:06.523]  I take it for two days and that stuff is crazy.
[03:20:06.523 --> 03:20:09.304]  I don't know how people take it so I quit taking it.
[03:20:09.304 --> 03:20:16.628]  I went in 30 days later, 20 minutes after that second appointment, he tells me he's his egg.
[03:20:16.628 --> 03:20:17.408]  And he uses my name.
[03:20:18.260 --> 03:20:20.881]  And he says, you have a saint complex.
[03:20:20.881 --> 03:20:23.102]  All saints are dead.
[03:20:23.102 --> 03:20:29.465]  You need to become one of the lying, cheating thieves of this world, or leave this world.
[03:20:29.465 --> 03:20:31.005]  What?
[03:20:31.005 --> 03:20:33.927]  Who said this to you?
[03:20:33.927 --> 03:20:38.669]  The head army psychiatrist at the Temple, Texas VA Hospital.
[03:20:44.192 --> 03:20:47.554]  Well, there is a cult of these people, and that sounds about like how they talk.
[03:20:47.554 --> 03:20:50.356]  Dr. Rocky, you ever heard anything like this happening before?
[03:20:50.356 --> 03:20:51.317]  Every day.
[03:20:51.317 --> 03:20:57.961]  One of the problems we're running into with the PTSD and psychologists and psychiatrists is they want to medicate all of the problems away.
[03:20:57.961 --> 03:21:05.646]  They don't want to deal with the true medical problems involved with the neurotoxicity from all the complex toxic exposures, not just DU.
[03:21:05.646 --> 03:21:08.828]  So they figure, well, we'll dumb them on down by giving them the meds.
[03:21:08.828 --> 03:21:11.490]  Now, the problem we're running into, and Army Times has written about this,
[03:21:11.988 --> 03:21:12.949]  It's been written up a lot.
[03:21:12.949 --> 03:21:14.471]  We've done a lot of reports.
[03:21:14.471 --> 03:21:25.785]  When you start combining all these medications, you combine pain medications with the other medications for the physiological problems, and then you combine the psychotropic drugs, you're going to end up with a total nightmare.
[03:21:25.785 --> 03:21:27.487]  And that's what we're seeing.
[03:21:27.487 --> 03:21:30.451]  The Army Times editorial here a few weeks ago called for that to stop.
[03:21:31.229 --> 03:21:33.630]  I've been, you know, continually yanking their chain.
[03:21:33.630 --> 03:21:35.651]  A lot of other people have, but they're getting those reports.
[03:21:35.651 --> 03:21:39.433]  Well, the Prozac insert admits it causes suicide.
[03:21:39.433 --> 03:21:40.333]  So here, take this.
[03:21:40.333 --> 03:21:40.874]  Right.
[03:21:40.874 --> 03:21:47.377]  But the main reason they put you on the drugs is so they can say you're a mental patient to take your Second Amendment rights.
[03:21:47.377 --> 03:21:47.937]  Right, right.
[03:21:47.937 --> 03:21:55.200]  Well, they found, and it's even in my records, he found that I did not have PTSD.
[03:21:55.200 --> 03:21:57.021]  Caller, are you still there?
[03:21:57.021 --> 03:21:58.622]  Canceled all my pain meds.
[03:22:00.307 --> 03:22:03.310]  Then they said they were worried I was going to get addicted to them.
[03:22:03.310 --> 03:22:04.011]  And they cancelled them.
[03:22:04.011 --> 03:22:06.933]  I've had nonsense.
[03:22:06.933 --> 03:22:09.856]  So, don't even worry about that.
[03:22:09.856 --> 03:22:14.761]  About two years after that, they sent me another letter for a standard hearing test.
[03:22:14.761 --> 03:22:16.563]  You're going to like this one.
[03:22:16.563 --> 03:22:19.325]  So they're still going after you?
[03:22:19.325 --> 03:22:22.809]  Yeah, so I figured let me go stick my toe back in the water and see what we can do.
[03:22:23.134 --> 03:22:24.575]  Well listen, Bullseye, God bless you.
[03:22:24.575 --> 03:22:27.857]  We'll do another one of these broadcasts soon, hurrying through the veterans calls.
[03:22:27.857 --> 03:22:29.939]  But we're hearing the same story over and over again.
[03:22:29.939 --> 03:22:32.261]  Angela in Oklahoma, you're on the air with Dr. Doug Rocky.
[03:22:32.261 --> 03:22:32.641]  Go ahead.
[03:22:32.641 --> 03:22:34.943]  Hello guys.
[03:22:34.943 --> 03:22:38.705]  My father fought in Korea, 1987.
[03:22:38.705 --> 03:22:43.549]  He had a nosebleed and then he started just bleeding all over the place.
[03:22:43.549 --> 03:22:51.594]  After months of this, we went to the VA down there in California and they had asked us, can we have permission to take your dad's blood?
[03:22:53.027 --> 03:22:58.950]  And when I walked in, because I asked for a conference with every single doctor that was involved, I mean... Sure, what happened?
[03:22:58.950 --> 03:23:00.711]  What happened?
[03:23:00.711 --> 03:23:08.976]  People from Mayo Clinic, from all over the world, scientists came to get my dad's blood, a slide of his blood.
[03:23:08.976 --> 03:23:17.340]  Not only was he from Oklahoma, chopped off whole blood, which his family was exterminated, coming here from Mississippi to begin with,
[03:23:18.297 --> 03:23:23.319]  They told us that my father was just as lucky as winning the lotto.
[03:23:23.319 --> 03:23:29.121]  His chances of getting what they called at the time was erythroleukemia.
[03:23:29.121 --> 03:23:32.242]  He finally died of erythroleukemia.
[03:23:32.242 --> 03:23:41.566]  My father's case was one of the very first cases that the VA, I guess... Yeah, there's now all these new cancers coming out and they're becoming very common.
[03:23:41.566 --> 03:23:42.586]  So what's the bottom line?
[03:23:42.586 --> 03:23:43.747]  What do you think he was exposed to?
[03:23:44.875 --> 03:23:46.417]  My dad told me he was a medic.
[03:23:46.417 --> 03:23:52.964]  He was pulling those soldiers out from stacks of, you know, pulling their dog tags from, you know, just pulling it from their neck.
[03:23:52.964 --> 03:23:53.845]  He was collecting them.
[03:23:53.845 --> 03:23:56.548]  He said bombs were going off all over.
[03:23:56.548 --> 03:23:59.451]  He said it was Agent Orange or Agent Green, something like that.
[03:23:59.451 --> 03:24:05.338]  He just told me all these bombs were going off and they ordered him to go there when they were exploding and collect the dog tags.
[03:24:06.122 --> 03:24:13.085]  They probably did some type of Project Shad on him, which we know they've done, you know, for decades.
[03:24:13.085 --> 03:24:14.186]  God bless you, Angela.
[03:24:14.186 --> 03:24:15.286]  Sorry about your father.
[03:24:15.286 --> 03:24:18.007]  Dr. Rocky, remind folks of Project Shad.
[03:24:18.007 --> 03:24:27.191]  Project Shad, you can check it up, go on the internet, do a search, Project, and then Shad, S-H-A-D, is deliberate use of chemical and biological and radiological materials on U.S.
[03:24:27.191 --> 03:24:27.912]  citizens, U.S.
[03:24:27.912 --> 03:24:28.352]  military.
[03:24:28.933 --> 03:24:32.915]  It began back in the 1950s and it continues to this day.
[03:24:32.915 --> 03:24:41.119]  The most recent one where I was totally involved in and I got exposed was down in Fort McClellan, Alabama, where they used Baxillus, Gold Bay guy.
[03:24:41.119 --> 03:24:43.860]  I was involved because I was on site and there when it happened.
[03:24:43.860 --> 03:24:49.623]  And then we know that's been done again out in the Southwest.
[03:24:49.623 --> 03:24:53.825]  And then we've actually had a confirmation that's been done up in the Northeast.
[03:24:53.825 --> 03:24:55.366]  So we see Project Shad.
[03:24:55.366 --> 03:24:57.146]  Our own team came up to Project Shad.
[03:24:57.146 --> 03:24:58.347]  We had a big outbreak here.
[03:24:59.216 --> 03:25:02.297]  And then they use it to pass a takeover of small farms and ranches.
[03:25:02.297 --> 03:25:02.737]  Unbelievable.
[03:25:02.737 --> 03:25:03.517]  That was powerful info.
[03:25:03.517 --> 03:25:05.277]  So some of your intel is that was a Project Shadop.
[03:25:23.442 --> 03:25:27.404]  Well, yeah, that's what I heard directly from too many people that were directly on the inside.
[03:25:27.404 --> 03:25:30.425]  I mean, it made sense because there's no way for this stuff to show up otherwise.
[03:25:30.425 --> 03:25:31.645]  You're incredible, Dr. Rockey.
[03:25:31.645 --> 03:25:33.886]  All your connections are just unbelievable.
[03:25:33.886 --> 03:25:35.287]  I wish they weren't.
[03:25:35.287 --> 03:25:40.869]  No, I mean, you're the Dr. D. You've trained most of the law enforcement in this country.
[03:25:40.869 --> 03:25:42.610]  Let's talk to George in Mississippi.
[03:25:42.610 --> 03:25:45.691]  You're on the air.
[03:25:45.691 --> 03:25:46.712]  Hey, Alex.
[03:25:46.712 --> 03:25:49.493]  I was a Bradley Gunner in Operation Iraqi Freedom.
[03:25:52.731 --> 03:25:55.051]  So that was seven years ago?
[03:25:55.051 --> 03:25:56.872]  Right, 2003.
[03:25:56.872 --> 03:25:59.352]  And what happened to you?
[03:25:59.352 --> 03:26:04.053]  Well, I just want to take another aspect of this.
[03:26:04.053 --> 03:26:07.194]  We had a briefing right before, alright?
[03:26:07.194 --> 03:26:16.455]  We had a lieutenant get all the Bradley gunners and the tanks, the tank crews, and gave us a briefing on depleted uranium.
[03:26:16.455 --> 03:26:19.236]  Because, I mean, we were just loaded down with it.
[03:26:19.236 --> 03:26:20.516]  This was before the invasion.
[03:26:22.475 --> 03:26:28.659]  He told us that you get more radiation from a microwave oven than from this stuff.
[03:26:28.659 --> 03:26:31.220]  And that it was totally safe.
[03:26:31.220 --> 03:26:32.181]  I'm being serious.
[03:26:32.181 --> 03:26:36.523]  I'm not going to forget that.
[03:26:36.523 --> 03:26:38.504]  I'm just telling you what we were told.
[03:26:38.504 --> 03:26:39.425]  No, no, I know.
[03:26:39.425 --> 03:26:40.826]  Listen, listen.
[03:26:40.826 --> 03:26:46.269]  During Operation Iraqi Freedom, I had calls, and even one guy I've known for years,
[03:26:48.102 --> 03:26:59.988]  And I was told, you are a stinking liar, there's no radiation, it's no problem, and I have all the Army's own reports, just because the military told them the same thing.
[03:26:59.988 --> 03:27:03.150]  And so they don't want to believe me, but when they die, they'll believe.
[03:27:03.150 --> 03:27:05.891]  But I'm sorry, go ahead sir.
[03:27:05.891 --> 03:27:10.894]  Well, this was our NBC expert, he was a lieutenant.
[03:27:10.894 --> 03:27:12.575]  NBC, Nuclear Biological Chemical.
[03:27:13.701 --> 03:27:16.924]  And, you know, straight from the so-called expert telling us this.
[03:27:16.924 --> 03:27:23.610]  Okay, well this is the head of the DU program, and I may have to hold you both over, we've got other guests, but this is so important.
[03:27:23.610 --> 03:27:25.972]  Dr. Rockey, you wrote the book on it.
[03:27:25.972 --> 03:27:32.818]  Well, the training, first off, this young gentleman who was on a Bradley fighting vehicle was required to have 40 hours of depleted uranium training.
[03:27:32.818 --> 03:27:36.882]  When I wrote the training, I coordinated everything with the infantry school in Fort Benning, Georgia.
[03:27:37.609 --> 03:27:44.614]  In fact, we were down there and we wrote the red team manual on the use of uranium munitions in the Bradley, probably a vehicle with 25 millimeter.
[03:27:44.614 --> 03:27:47.356]  Nobody's supposed to sit on top of the ammo inside the Bradley.
[03:27:47.356 --> 03:27:50.398]  You're supposed to have 40 hours of training.
[03:27:50.398 --> 03:27:54.260]  There's handling requirements, medical requirements, PPE requirements.
[03:27:54.260 --> 03:27:59.604]  Then the other thing too, and this comes on down to the same thing, and this idiot, I'd love to have his name because I just, you know,
[03:28:00.285 --> 03:28:06.308]  I'm still in the Army, I'm a retired Army officer, and I'll just call the chemical corps commander up right away and say, hey, this is what you guys are teaching.
[03:28:06.308 --> 03:28:16.553]  First off, a microwave oven is non-ionized irradiation, it's an RF wave microwave, and DU is ionized irradiation, which is alpha, beta, gamma, and x-ray.
[03:28:16.553 --> 03:28:17.473]  Totally different things.
[03:28:17.473 --> 03:28:22.656]  So when this guy tells you that they're comparable, he doesn't have a clue what he's talking about.
[03:28:22.656 --> 03:28:26.238]  And that just indicates a total deliberate failure and deliberate lies.
[03:28:27.388 --> 03:28:34.793]  Well, look, Dr. Rocky, I've confirmed, seven years ago, they told them all to tell them this, and most of these guys just believed it.
[03:28:34.793 --> 03:28:36.634]  They do because they want to.
[03:28:36.634 --> 03:28:44.899]  They don't want to believe that all these guys would lie to them, send them to their death, and give them no equipment that operates, and put them into areas where they shouldn't be.
[03:28:44.899 --> 03:28:54.645]  I mean, I didn't want to believe it either, you know, for over 30 years while I was in the military, and until I was faced to do it, when I became, you know, their number one guy, and had to figure out what was happening.
[03:28:54.645 --> 03:28:55.206]  It scared me.
[03:28:55.856 --> 03:28:58.502]  That scared me totally, and that it was reality.
[03:28:58.502 --> 03:29:00.206]  A reality check, as you've mentioned.
[03:29:00.206 --> 03:29:01.729]  And reality's still there.
[03:29:01.729 --> 03:29:04.736]  Even if you deny it or don't know reality, folks, it's still right there.
[03:29:06.667 --> 03:29:13.169]  You know, somebody can be hopped up on PCP and jump off a 50-story building because they think they're a bird, but they're not a bird.
[03:29:13.169 --> 03:29:27.512]  And, you know, all this talk about, oh, we have these policies around using DU, which don't even really protect you, as you've said, that's almost like, you know, putting somebody in an eggshell, you know, armor and having them jump out in front of an 18-wheeler going 100 miles an hour.
[03:29:27.512 --> 03:29:29.813]  I mean, it's all just window dressing, isn't it, doctor?
[03:29:30.213 --> 03:29:30.393]  Great.
[03:29:30.393 --> 03:29:31.794]  Let me give you a direct... Hold on, hold on.
[03:29:31.794 --> 03:29:38.880]  We're gonna do five more minutes, then we got Stuart Rhodes, the head of Oath Keepers, and Mr. Irish, because he's an Oath Keeper supporter, had his child taken.
[03:29:38.880 --> 03:29:40.902]  We're gonna give you the latest on that.
[03:29:40.902 --> 03:29:47.648]  We're gonna come back with Georgia, Mississippi, and Dr. Doug Rocky to put bookends on this, but unbelievable.
[03:29:47.648 --> 03:29:49.870]  Yeah, this stuff isn't bad for you boys.
[03:29:49.870 --> 03:29:51.611]  Here's their own reports.
[03:29:51.611 --> 03:29:53.012]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.012 --> 03:29:55.534]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.534 --> 03:29:58.217]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:02.648 --> 03:30:07.133]  Fight back this cold and flu season with the world's best garlic extract, Ali-C.
[03:30:07.133 --> 03:30:07.973]  Why Ali-C?
[03:30:07.973 --> 03:30:11.557]  Because it helps your body fight viruses, bacteria, and fungi.
[03:30:11.557 --> 03:30:19.245]  Ali-C has been scientifically proven in double-blind studies using low doses to greatly reduce the number, severity, and duration of common colds.
[03:30:19.605 --> 03:30:25.167]  Alley C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized allicin, the active ingredient in crushed garlic.
[03:30:25.167 --> 03:30:30.389]  Studies show Alley C is effective against MRSA, bacterial, fungal, and viral infections.
[03:30:30.389 --> 03:30:34.090]  One tablet of Alley C has the equivalent of 40 cloves of garlic.
[03:30:34.090 --> 03:30:40.232]  Alley C supports your body's resistance to all types of conditions and can help lower high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
[03:30:40.532 --> 03:30:45.354]  So boost your body's resistance to infection with nature's best garlic extract, Ali-C.

[03:31:01.021 --> 03:31:05.985]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:31:05.985 --> 03:31:06.985]  What have we got?
[03:31:06.985 --> 03:31:09.447]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:31:09.447 --> 03:31:10.448]  A republic.
[03:31:10.448 --> 03:31:13.090]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[03:31:13.090 --> 03:31:15.352]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[03:31:15.352 --> 03:31:17.373]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:31:17.373 --> 03:31:19.054]  So they think they own our land?
[03:31:19.054 --> 03:31:20.375]  They think they own our water?
[03:31:20.375 --> 03:31:20.996]  Children?
[03:31:20.996 --> 03:31:22.117]  Our education?
[03:31:22.117 --> 03:31:22.937]  Our money?
[03:31:22.937 --> 03:31:26.600]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:31:26.960 --> 03:31:31.926]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[03:31:31.926 --> 03:31:32.947]  We have the facts.
[03:31:32.947 --> 03:31:34.108]  We have the Constitution.
[03:31:34.108 --> 03:31:35.010]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[03:31:35.010 --> 03:31:35.911]  We have common law.
[03:31:35.911 --> 03:31:38.434]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:31:38.434 --> 03:31:42.198]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.

[03:33:09.395 --> 03:33:13.858]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:33:13.858 --> 03:33:18.961]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:18.961 --> 03:33:32.830]  We're getting Jonathan Irish who had his newborn baby girl snatched because they said he had bought guns and was associated with Oath Keepers along with Stuart Rhodes popping back in in about five minutes.
[03:33:34.192 --> 03:33:45.019]  George of Mississippi, without myself interrupting you, tell us exactly what you were briefed, what you were told going into Operation Iraqi Freedom seven and a half years ago.
[03:33:45.019 --> 03:33:52.383]  Then I want to get Dr. Doug Rocky's breakdown again from, this is the guy that literally wrote the book for the Army on it, on what they know it does.
[03:33:52.383 --> 03:33:55.065]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:33:55.065 --> 03:33:58.247]  This briefing was very informal.
[03:33:58.247 --> 03:33:59.667]  This was literally like two weeks.
[03:33:59.667 --> 03:34:02.089]  This was in Kuwait right before we invaded.
[03:34:03.012 --> 03:34:10.974]  And this is just, uh, you know, they just had us out in the middle of the desert in a group with, uh, the tank crews and the Bradley crews.
[03:34:10.974 --> 03:34:14.455]  Just the crews, not the soldiers that ride in the back.
[03:34:14.455 --> 03:34:17.015]  The Bradley's an armored personnel carrier.
[03:34:17.015 --> 03:34:26.638]  We have anywhere from eight to ten troops in the back of that thing with all the depleted uranium rounds that they're literally surrounded by in a metal coffin, basically.
[03:34:26.638 --> 03:34:28.738]  And this stuff's very soft.
[03:34:28.738 --> 03:34:32.039]  It's very heavy, but it's very soft and flakes off, correct, Doctor?
[03:34:32.039 --> 03:34:32.539]  Absolutely.
[03:34:34.713 --> 03:34:41.920]  Yeah, so you're in a metal box that's in the desert and it's nothing but dust, too, so you're just constantly breathing in this dust.
[03:34:41.920 --> 03:34:44.122]  But anyway, look, here's the thing.
[03:34:44.122 --> 03:34:56.674]  The biggest lie was they never told us, because it is, as I understand it, mildly radioactive in the state of, you know, it's just sitting there in an unexploded ground.
[03:34:56.674 --> 03:34:59.597]  After you fire it, it becomes highly radioactive.
[03:35:00.305 --> 03:35:01.085]  If I'm not mistaken.
[03:35:01.085 --> 03:35:02.385]  Well, doctor, explain to him.
[03:35:02.385 --> 03:35:07.166]  It's that it gets into micron particles that are able to pierce the cells.
[03:35:07.166 --> 03:35:11.747]  And so you have the exposure of the radiation at point-blank range systemically.
[03:35:11.747 --> 03:35:18.289]  That's why most of the calls were from the 19-year-old war, where 20-plus percent of the troops are dead from it.
[03:35:18.289 --> 03:35:22.009]  Now we're just now, you know, having the new troops say, yeah, I've got diarrhea.
[03:35:22.009 --> 03:35:23.070]  Yeah, I'm sick.
[03:35:23.070 --> 03:35:24.470]  But it's going to get worse and worse for them.
[03:35:24.470 --> 03:35:25.610]  Doctor, correct me if I'm wrong.
[03:35:25.610 --> 03:35:27.030]  Let's put it real simple, okay?
[03:35:27.030 --> 03:35:29.791]  And if this gets a little offensive to somebody, I'm sorry.
[03:35:30.371 --> 03:35:38.395]  When you're sitting on top of the depleted uranium round in the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, you get 300 millirems per hour.
[03:35:38.395 --> 03:35:40.736]  Strictly, 300 millirems, okay?
[03:35:40.736 --> 03:35:42.317]  That's how much you're getting.
[03:35:42.317 --> 03:35:44.258]  Alright, that's the exposure.
[03:35:44.258 --> 03:35:57.505]  Now, the maximum total dose an individual is allowed to sit on top of, and you have to understand this is right up next to the male testicles or the female genitalia, within 20 minutes you have exceeded
[03:35:59.375 --> 03:36:03.398]  Exceeded the yearly dose.
[03:36:03.398 --> 03:36:08.503]  Okay, now you were supposed to have had four, four, a full 40 hours of training as Bradley Crewman.
[03:36:08.503 --> 03:36:09.624]  That is required.
[03:36:09.624 --> 03:36:13.006]  That's in the Army Regulations in the training.
[03:36:13.006 --> 03:36:13.787]  And it didn't happen.
[03:36:13.787 --> 03:36:18.151]  They probably didn't even give you, uh, you didn't even pass the Com-Tas training on DDU.
[03:36:18.151 --> 03:36:19.492]  They probably didn't even tell you about it.
[03:36:19.492 --> 03:36:20.773]  It was in the Com-Tas manual.
[03:36:22.591 --> 03:36:23.411]  They're not going to.
[03:36:23.411 --> 03:36:29.414]  They can't tell the soldier because if they tell the soldier the truth, the soldier is going to tell them, I'm not getting in that equipment.
[03:36:29.414 --> 03:36:30.335]  I'm not going to use it.
[03:36:30.335 --> 03:36:32.996]  I'm not going near it.
[03:36:32.996 --> 03:36:34.257]  And that's why they don't tell anybody.
[03:36:34.257 --> 03:36:43.261]  And then once they do and they find out they get a problem, my phone rings off the hook and I'm stopped on a street and I'm stopped at church and I'm stopped at school and I'm stopped at the grocery store.
[03:36:43.261 --> 03:36:43.682]  Help me.
[03:36:43.682 --> 03:36:44.062]  Help me.
[03:36:44.062 --> 03:36:44.382]  Help me.
[03:36:46.027 --> 03:36:48.429]  Because nobody in the military is going to tell you the truth.
[03:36:48.429 --> 03:36:56.095]  The VA is not going to tell you that their own clinician's guide states very specifically, quote, some things you need to know about veterans.
[03:36:56.095 --> 03:36:58.497]  Clinician's guide to veterans specific issue.
[03:36:58.497 --> 03:37:03.941]  In which they say, quote, some of the physical symptoms which occur as a result of exposure to depleted uranium are sleep problems,
[03:37:04.448 --> 03:37:04.688]  I'm good.
[03:37:27.173 --> 03:37:29.174]  Unfortunately, Doctor, I've got to stop you there.
[03:37:29.174 --> 03:37:30.815]  Thank you for your time and energy.
[03:37:30.815 --> 03:37:36.538]  All the documents you sent us are going up on InfoWars.com and the photographs and the Army's own reports.
[03:37:36.538 --> 03:37:42.461]  But you didn't even get into the fact that once it hits something, then it aerosolizes and is breathed into the lungs.
[03:37:42.461 --> 03:37:47.103]  Bottom line, when they're telling... Sorry, George, go ahead.
[03:37:48.208 --> 03:37:56.453]  I was just saying, that was my point, even after you fired and it hits like an enemy tank or building, isn't it like a thousand times worse at that point?
[03:37:56.453 --> 03:37:58.454]  And that's what we were lying about.
[03:37:58.454 --> 03:38:06.939]  If you really find dust, it goes right into the body, you can't keep it out, and there's where all the direct health effects are because now it's inside the body in direct contact with the cells.
[03:38:07.714 --> 03:38:13.056]  Throughout the whole body, and that's why the physiological effects are so devastating and sometimes delayed and sometimes immediate.
[03:38:13.056 --> 03:38:18.639]  But it also sheds during the projectile process out of the barrel.
[03:38:18.639 --> 03:38:19.259]  All the way through.
[03:38:19.259 --> 03:38:20.399]  The whole barrel is contaminated.
[03:38:20.399 --> 03:38:24.541]  The Bradley, that's what we found on the Bradley and the Abrams, the barrels were thoroughly contaminated.
[03:38:24.541 --> 03:38:29.743]  We put special precautions in place, which obviously they never told you, George.
[03:38:29.743 --> 03:38:31.024]  Well, gentlemen, gentlemen.
[03:38:31.024 --> 03:38:33.145]  We had to clean those barrels.
[03:38:33.145 --> 03:38:35.806]  Yeah, but they didn't give you the proper equipment or anything to do it with.
[03:38:38.024 --> 03:38:39.284]  Alright, George, we're out of time.
[03:38:39.284 --> 03:38:43.426]  Dr. Rockey, thank you for spending an hour and 40 minutes with us.
[03:38:43.426 --> 03:38:47.327]  God bless you, sir, for your continued service, and hopefully we're going to get some justice.
[03:38:47.327 --> 03:38:55.550]  Everybody who has family in the military, get the information, take the video from this show, post it at PrisonPlanet.tv and get it out to everyone you know.
[03:38:55.550 --> 03:39:00.111]  Warn them that using DU weapons is a slow death death sentence.
[03:39:00.111 --> 03:39:01.872]  Dr. Rockey, thank you so much, sir.
[03:39:01.872 --> 03:39:02.352]  Thank you, sir.
[03:39:02.987 --> 03:39:04.528]  You bet.
[03:39:04.528 --> 03:39:05.829]  Shifting gears now.
[03:39:05.829 --> 03:39:16.237]  In the first hour, we got an update from Mr. Irish and, of course, Mr. Rhodes of Oath Keepers and Jonathan Irish.
[03:39:16.237 --> 03:39:20.500]  They're going to have a protest coming up Thursday.
[03:39:20.500 --> 03:39:23.763]  Stuart Rhodes is going to fly to New Hampshire to do this where they took the newborn baby.
[03:39:24.721 --> 03:39:25.121]  I don't
[03:39:54.998 --> 03:39:56.819]  I briefly wanted to get them back up.
[03:39:56.819 --> 03:39:58.360]  Who do we have?
[03:39:58.360 --> 03:40:00.961]  We have both of them?
[03:40:00.961 --> 03:40:01.602]  Okay, great.
[03:40:01.602 --> 03:40:08.065]  Let's go to Jonathan Irish and, of course, the founder of Oathkeeper, Stuart Rhodes.
[03:40:08.065 --> 03:40:11.607]  Gentlemen, we've only got about 10 minutes here and I appreciate you coming on.
[03:40:11.607 --> 03:40:16.050]  Any new updates or new developments, Mr. Irish, since we talked to you three hours ago?
[03:40:17.172 --> 03:40:41.461]  Uh, no new updates, I've actually, uh, I just had to hang up with an attorney who called me, um, who left me a voicemail over the weekend, but it was, he left an incorrect, uh, digit for a telephone number, I couldn't get back to him, I have to call him back as soon as I get off the phone with you guys, and there's also several other attorneys that are trying to contact me as well, uh, including, I believe, Aaron Knappen.
[03:40:41.761 --> 03:40:43.161]  Well, here's who you need.
[03:40:43.161 --> 03:40:48.923]  You need family court expert, hard-nosed lawyers that are known to know how to take down the CPS.
[03:40:48.923 --> 03:40:50.724]  The CPS violates all the laws.
[03:40:50.724 --> 03:40:53.005]  They violate the laws, procedures, everything.
[03:40:53.005 --> 03:40:55.066]  There's major watchdog groups that fight them.
[03:40:55.066 --> 03:40:56.466]  That's who you need.
[03:40:56.466 --> 03:41:01.808]  And they'll know how to go in there and annihilate these people politically and with the law.
[03:41:01.808 --> 03:41:05.009]  But they're also going to try demonization tactics against you and other things.
[03:41:05.809 --> 03:41:08.550]  Let's go back now and stay right there, Mr. Irish.
[03:41:08.550 --> 03:41:09.831]  We'll let you go soon.
[03:41:09.831 --> 03:41:13.312]  We'll get you live, of course, on throughout the week and at the demonstration coming up.
[03:41:13.312 --> 03:41:18.455]  But Stuart Rhodes, for those that just joined us recapping, you have the headline up at Oathkeepers.org.
[03:41:18.455 --> 03:41:20.836]  We have it up at InfoWars.com.
[03:41:20.836 --> 03:41:21.776]  Confirmed.
[03:41:21.776 --> 03:41:28.059]  Court did rely on Oathkeeper Association to take baby, the full affidavit and court order, up on the site.
[03:41:28.059 --> 03:41:28.579]  Stuart Rhodes.
[03:41:29.858 --> 03:41:50.627]  Yeah, that confirms what we've been saying in the last four days, that the order of the judge, ordering CPS to take custody of the children, confirms that they relied upon the affidavit and in fact incorporated the affidavit and adopted everything in the affidavit as part of the findings and facts of the court.
[03:41:50.627 --> 03:41:51.868]  And so, yeah, not only does CPS
[03:41:53.008 --> 03:41:58.413]  I'm asserting that the association with Oath Keepers is one of the reasons, but you have the court adopting it.
[03:41:58.413 --> 03:42:02.436]  And so this is what has to stop and has to change.
[03:42:02.436 --> 03:42:14.107]  I hope the judge will have the sense to go back and look and see that this is wrong and amend the order to explicitly exclude the mention of Oath Keepers and the
[03:42:16.488 --> 03:42:17.309]  We're good to go.
[03:42:35.131 --> 03:42:38.634]  I'm glad to hear that John is getting some local counsel.
[03:42:38.634 --> 03:42:40.895]  John is definitely close to getting completely squared away.
[03:42:40.895 --> 03:42:50.783]  Laura, like you said, I can help with the First Amendment claims, but they need local counsel who is known by the court and is known right there in New Hampshire who can handle the actual claims.
[03:42:50.783 --> 03:42:57.508]  And of course, you're a constitutional Yale graduate lawyer, worked with Ron Paul in your own right, so you're no slouch when it comes to that, but law is so specialized.
[03:42:57.968 --> 03:42:59.230]  I'm not an expert in family law.
[03:42:59.230 --> 03:43:01.772]  I don't know where I can, but he does need an expert in that, that's right.
[03:43:08.169 --> 03:43:09.050]  Absolutely.
[03:43:09.050 --> 03:43:13.713]  Mr. Irish, there's donations I know coming in to Oathkeepers.org.
[03:43:13.713 --> 03:43:22.920]  People need to specify that it is for your legal defense, but do you want to say anything to all the folks out there that are supporting you and this being a national story?
[03:43:22.920 --> 03:43:37.752]  Again, I have to, Stephanie and I, Stephanie's still in the middle of an interview, but I'm going to speak on her behalf and again reiterate, we cannot express our gratitude for all the support that everyone has given, and you know,
[03:43:39.148 --> 03:43:54.934]  We appreciate it so much and trust that when this is all done and over with, our children will know who is responsible for helping mommy and daddy bring them home.
[03:43:54.934 --> 03:44:00.076]  I'm sorry, this has gone on for so long and I've pushed everything to the side and I've
[03:44:07.083 --> 03:44:08.724]  I have pushed all the emotions to the side.
[03:44:08.724 --> 03:44:09.944]  It's getting hard.
[03:44:09.944 --> 03:44:11.124]  It's gotta be exhausting.
[03:44:11.124 --> 03:44:14.666]  I couldn't imagine the hell you're going through with this newborn daughter snatched.
[03:44:14.666 --> 03:44:21.888]  But, you know, hopefully by exposing this, thousands of other children won't suffer similar fates.
[03:44:21.888 --> 03:44:29.631]  But we all just need to pray to get your daughter back and that justice be done against these monsters because I know how wicked the CPS is.
[03:44:34.320 --> 03:44:37.041]  Well, I hate to scare people out there, but it's the truth.
[03:44:37.041 --> 03:44:43.825]  A child is five times more likely, according to the Justice Department's own admissions, to be abused in government custody than anywhere else.
[03:44:43.825 --> 03:44:49.548]  They are the most dangerous monsters, and all the time they just get away with living nightmares.
[03:44:49.548 --> 03:44:53.330]  We've just got to pray for everybody involved in all of this.
[03:44:53.330 --> 03:44:55.571]  Stuart Rhodes, any other comments you want to make about this?
[03:44:55.571 --> 03:44:57.132]  Of course, we'll get updates from you throughout the week.
[03:44:57.875 --> 03:45:04.858]  Well, one thing I'd like to say is that in this fight, first and foremost, is the family's fight to get their child back.
[03:45:04.858 --> 03:45:12.921]  And so I encourage everyone to refrain from any hot-headed comments and solicitations of violence or anything like that.
[03:45:12.921 --> 03:45:15.002]  That does not help this family whatsoever.
[03:45:15.002 --> 03:45:18.464]  And so on my side in particular, if I see anything like that, it will be believed immediately.
[03:45:18.464 --> 03:45:21.885]  I'm going to assume the person saying that is an agent of a drug consumer.
[03:45:21.885 --> 03:45:24.086]  And with this rally on Thursday, we're going to be firm.
[03:45:24.446 --> 03:45:29.008]  No, exactly, because you've got so many former and current police, they're going to know how to spot provocateurs.
[03:45:29.008 --> 03:45:32.170]  They better stay far away from this rally coming up Thursday.
[03:45:50.762 --> 03:45:51.282]  Absolutely.
[03:45:51.282 --> 03:45:53.884]  We'll work with the police to find them if they show up.
[03:45:53.884 --> 03:45:55.525]  So that's one concern I have.
[03:45:55.525 --> 03:45:56.386]  It's not that big a deal.
[03:45:56.386 --> 03:45:56.926]  We'll be okay.
[03:46:21.982 --> 03:46:25.944]  All right, Stuart Rhodes, we'll continue to talk to you as things unfold.
[03:46:25.944 --> 03:46:33.906]  I'm going to let you go because I can tell you're on the road, but all the reportage on this is at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, OathKeepers.org.
[03:46:33.906 --> 03:46:42.549]  It's important now that we've been authorized to put the full affidavit out that people get this and send it out to all the media that's been putting out this info, saying that OathKeepers wasn't mentioned.
[03:46:42.549 --> 03:46:46.871]  It is confirmed by three newspapers and the local TV and the affidavit we have.
[03:46:46.871 --> 03:46:49.132]  OathKeepers and gun ownership is mentioned.
[03:46:49.132 --> 03:46:50.112]  Correct, Stuart Rhodes?
[03:46:50.942 --> 03:46:53.664]  That's correct, absolutely correct.
[03:47:11.860 --> 03:47:12.880]  This is real.
[03:47:12.880 --> 03:47:15.061]  This is really going on in America.
[03:47:15.061 --> 03:47:22.704]  They really do have a Southern Poverty Law Center involved with local psychiatrists, school teachers, everybody spying on you through your kids.
[03:47:22.704 --> 03:47:23.844]  This is real.
[03:47:23.844 --> 03:47:25.364]  This is really happening.
[03:47:25.364 --> 03:47:26.685]  The banks are really imploding.
[03:47:28.374 --> 03:47:35.621]  The mortgages really are being scammed and they are stopping the foreclosures because it's coming out.
[03:47:35.621 --> 03:47:38.544]  Okay, gold really has gone to an all-time record again today.
[03:47:38.544 --> 03:47:39.585]  The New World Order is real.
[03:47:39.585 --> 03:47:40.626]  This is all real.
[03:47:40.626 --> 03:47:42.988]  Stop living in denial.
[03:47:42.988 --> 03:47:44.730]  Finishing up with Mr. Irish.
[03:47:44.730 --> 03:47:46.131]  God bless you for your strength, sir.
[03:47:46.131 --> 03:47:47.692]  I've watched videos of you.
[03:47:47.692 --> 03:47:49.274]  I think you're a good guy.
[03:47:49.274 --> 03:47:50.775]  I've talked to you.
[03:47:50.775 --> 03:47:52.357]  I've seen their classic tactics.
[03:47:52.637 --> 03:47:55.000]  Thank you very much and God bless you all and thank you all for your support again.
[03:48:08.596 --> 03:48:20.466]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I've got a bunch of foreclosure experts on who a decade ago broke down what's happening with foreclosure freeze could undermine housing market.
[03:48:20.466 --> 03:48:28.974]  They have been engaged in so many different scams, even taking houses that are paid for, shelling mortgages over and over again, stealing escrow, not transferring deeds.
[03:48:29.794 --> 03:48:33.798]  Uh, just scamming, especially lower middle class people that don't know how to defend themselves.
[03:48:33.798 --> 03:48:35.980]  And the corrupt courts have been involved in this.
[03:48:35.980 --> 03:48:41.284]  But so many people are standing up and getting involved that that's coming to a grinding halt.
[03:48:41.284 --> 03:48:43.046]  I want to hit on some of that.
[03:48:43.046 --> 03:48:45.468]  The economic news is just unbelievable.
[03:48:45.468 --> 03:48:46.969]  I mean, it's all coming true.
[03:48:46.969 --> 03:48:48.611]  It's all happening.
[03:48:48.611 --> 03:48:53.915]  Everything we've covered in the last 15 years is now being just completely verified.
[03:48:53.915 --> 03:48:55.257]  And I don't have
[03:48:57.213 --> 03:48:57.514]  You know what?
[03:49:07.186 --> 03:49:19.669]  of just being braced by being buffeted but at the same time it's bracing or it's like being thrown into cold water just realizing we're in a hellhole.
[03:49:19.669 --> 03:49:28.352]  We're in a psycho land with a bunch of mind-controlled people watching football and sports and garbage and sex and drugs and mindless me-me-me.
[03:49:28.352 --> 03:49:33.193]  Meanwhile they're blind to the kill grid going in all around them and I just
[03:49:36.559 --> 03:49:45.723]  It just freaks me out that Glenn Beck reaches 30, 40 million people or more every week, and he's going blind from aspartame, there's no doubt.
[03:49:45.723 --> 03:49:48.084]  All the major medical reports admit it.
[03:49:48.084 --> 03:49:57.168]  And we write an article, Drudge Report links to it, and his co-host, while he's out of town getting medical treatment, makes jokes about it.
[03:49:57.768 --> 03:50:01.149]  About our article, and yeah, Diet Coke's bad for Glenn.
[03:50:01.149 --> 03:50:03.609]  You know, it's not funny.
[03:50:03.609 --> 03:50:05.590]  None of this is funny.
[03:50:05.590 --> 03:50:10.351]  Almost all the kids' gum and candy, and their little vitamins.
[03:50:10.351 --> 03:50:17.832]  And where's that box I had of... I had a box in here of anti-allergy medicine.
[03:50:17.832 --> 03:50:19.093]  Here it is.
[03:50:19.093 --> 03:50:20.613]  Alvert.
[03:50:20.613 --> 03:50:24.374]  And it's got a little happy kid on the front, bubble gum flavor, aspartame inside.
[03:50:25.635 --> 03:50:27.376]  I mean, I got Flintstones with it.
[03:50:27.376 --> 03:50:29.936]  When I was little, I ate these before it had aspartame.
[03:50:29.936 --> 03:50:31.057]  My mama would give them to me.
[03:50:31.057 --> 03:50:33.017]  I mean, come on, man.
[03:50:33.017 --> 03:50:35.878]  And I gotta hear jokes out of people when it's killing you.
[03:50:35.878 --> 03:50:43.580]  You know, Big Red, Big League Chew, Juicy Fruit.
[03:50:43.580 --> 03:50:49.462]  I mean, and we linked in there even to Fox News articles admitting cancer and rats that eat it.
[03:50:49.462 --> 03:50:50.282]  It's funny to you?
[03:50:51.578 --> 03:50:53.380]  You know, the world government isn't funny.
[03:50:53.380 --> 03:50:55.103]  Dying of cancer.
[03:50:55.103 --> 03:50:56.084]  Losing your eyesight.
[03:50:56.084 --> 03:50:58.548]  It's not funny.
[03:50:58.548 --> 03:50:59.990]  You're under a dark spell.
[03:51:01.710 --> 03:51:05.794]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[03:51:05.794 --> 03:51:10.298]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[03:51:10.298 --> 03:51:16.463]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[03:51:16.463 --> 03:51:18.906]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[03:51:18.906 --> 03:51:24.891]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[03:51:24.991 --> 03:51:28.395]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[03:51:28.395 --> 03:51:30.277]  There is no other program of its kind.
[03:51:30.277 --> 03:51:32.460]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[03:51:32.460 --> 03:51:37.326]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[03:51:37.326 --> 03:51:38.147]  Guaranteed.
[03:51:38.147 --> 03:51:42.192]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[03:51:42.432 --> 03:51:47.234]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.
[03:51:47.234 --> 03:51:48.414]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuaranteed.com.
[03:51:48.414 --> 03:51:49.114]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuaranteed.com.
[03:52:05.433 --> 03:52:06.714]  Tyranny is here.
[03:52:06.714 --> 03:52:10.635]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:52:10.635 --> 03:52:12.856]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:52:12.856 --> 03:52:18.739]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:52:18.739 --> 03:52:24.982]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:52:25.402 --> 03:52:31.345]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:52:31.345 --> 03:52:35.567]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[03:52:35.567 --> 03:52:39.850]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:52:39.850 --> 03:52:45.813]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[03:52:45.813 --> 03:52:49.355]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:52:49.355 --> 03:52:51.316]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:52:51.316 --> 03:52:51.756]  It's here.
[03:52:52.416 --> 03:52:59.244]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:53:07.213 --> 03:53:09.315]  A great and terrible storm is approaching.
[03:53:09.315 --> 03:53:12.877]  So what's the best way to get ready to get prepared for hard times ahead?
[03:53:12.877 --> 03:53:22.464]  In producing Off The Grid News, a weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[03:53:22.464 --> 03:53:25.366]  It's the best way to get a black belt in emergency preparedness.
[03:53:25.546 --> 03:53:28.007]  Survival skills and off-the-grid living.
[03:53:28.007 --> 03:53:30.488]  Off-the-grid news is fiercely independent.
[03:53:30.488 --> 03:53:41.514]  All about self-reliance and packed with helpful information on survival gardening, food preparation, alternative energy, herbal medicines, privacy and security, as well as God, gold and guns.
[03:53:41.514 --> 03:53:43.455]  With absolutely no apologies.
[03:53:43.455 --> 03:53:48.097]  And the best part, this $100 a year service is now free of charge for our listeners.
[03:53:48.097 --> 03:53:48.557]  That's right.
[03:53:48.677 --> 03:53:49.117]  We're good.
[03:54:03.308 --> 03:54:07.111]  By the way, it's going to go up at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[03:54:07.111 --> 03:54:17.059]  We have the video of Glenn Beck's radio show where for 15 minutes or 14 and a half, be technical, they just said, I'm a complete lying piece of scum filth.
[03:54:17.059 --> 03:54:21.863]  Basically, I'm a complete conspiracy monger and that aspartame isn't bad for you.
[03:54:21.863 --> 03:54:24.425]  And then they make jokes about Rumsfeld plague.
[03:54:24.425 --> 03:54:26.367]  He's the guy that got it approved back in 81.
[03:54:27.648 --> 03:54:30.050]  When they couldn't get it approved in the 70s twice.
[03:54:30.050 --> 03:54:37.154]  And they make it all a diversion and claim that I'm saying Rumsfeld personally snuck in and poisoned Glenn Beck.
[03:54:37.154 --> 03:54:42.478]  That's how they hope that I guess he goes blind and all his listeners go blind that drink it.
[03:54:43.305 --> 03:54:46.846]  When the article is linked to Fox News articles about this.
[03:54:46.846 --> 03:54:52.688]  The article we wrote, the government reports, universities, Fox News, AP.
[03:54:52.688 --> 03:55:01.891]  I'm gonna have Watson write an article countering them, and I'm gonna have him put like 50 university links about blindness in there.
[03:55:01.891 --> 03:55:06.992]  I mean, we're gonna throw the sink at these guys and show them how they've been manipulated.
[03:55:06.992 --> 03:55:11.834]  How they wouldn't, they'd say, oh, Infowars, they're nuts, they claim Rumsfeld poisoned Glenn's Coke.
[03:55:12.674 --> 03:55:15.577]  No, he didn't sneak in and put it in Glenn's Diet Coke.
[03:55:15.577 --> 03:55:16.478]  They got it approved.
[03:55:16.478 --> 03:55:23.925]  I mean, imagine his listeners, you know, 10, 15 million of them listening, thinking that I'm saying Rumsfeld snuck into their office and poisoned him.
[03:55:23.925 --> 03:55:25.547]  That's what they're saying.
[03:55:25.547 --> 03:55:26.888]  It's 14 minutes long.
[03:55:26.888 --> 03:55:28.090]  I only got to see three minutes of it.
[03:55:28.090 --> 03:55:28.790]  It was incredible.
[03:55:29.591 --> 03:55:30.992]  That's what they do.
[03:55:30.992 --> 03:55:33.153]  They make jokes about DU.
[03:55:33.153 --> 03:55:35.295]  They make jokes about all of it.
[03:55:35.295 --> 03:55:40.198]  And Glenn Beck will go blind and worship the government and give it to his kids, probably.
[03:55:40.198 --> 03:55:42.059]  He'll probably come back and make fun of us.
[03:55:42.059 --> 03:55:48.403]  He'll go blind, drink and die at Coke, going, oh, I love it, it's so good, Alex is scum.
[03:55:48.403 --> 03:55:50.464]  These people are just psychopaths, man.
[03:55:50.464 --> 03:55:51.765]  What is wrong with you people?
[03:55:52.964 --> 03:56:01.310]  I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up at the very end of this special four-hour transmission because gold rises to record closing price on speculation, dollar resumes slump.
[03:56:01.310 --> 03:56:04.032]  The Fed has announced again today they are going to devalue the dollar.
[03:56:04.032 --> 03:56:08.875]  They've already been doing it, but this all-out, we're going Argentina, we're going Weimar.
[03:56:08.875 --> 03:56:10.596]  I mean, boom!
[03:56:10.596 --> 03:56:11.056]  Boom!
[03:56:11.056 --> 03:56:12.357]  It's happening.
[03:56:12.357 --> 03:56:13.798]  And gold has gone up to $13,350 plus.
[03:56:17.486 --> 03:56:20.407]  Congressional staffers are gaining from insiders trading.
[03:56:20.407 --> 03:56:21.347]  That's going on.
[03:56:21.347 --> 03:56:22.908]  And here's a current memo article.
[03:56:22.908 --> 03:56:29.551]  Gold rises as Bankster currency war gains momentum, which the Trilateral Commission said in 75 they would do.
[03:56:29.551 --> 03:56:35.273]  Once they had their global system in place, they would have fake currency wars with G20 concerted devaluation coordinated.
[03:56:36.013 --> 03:56:45.699]  They'll claim it's an accident, as we told you, and then call for a new global architecture run by them to stop it when they're the ones already running the global architecture of the G20.
[03:56:45.699 --> 03:56:48.540]  Ted, we only got about two and a half minutes.
[03:56:48.540 --> 03:56:50.702]  You've still got gold, what you bought now.
[03:56:50.702 --> 03:56:54.284]  It's always two weeks ago, because you buy every two weeks, so you run out of the stuff you had two weeks ago.
[03:56:54.284 --> 03:56:56.125]  Now it's two weeks later, you're running out of that.
[03:56:56.125 --> 03:56:58.446]  It's a lot lower than gold and silver currently are.
[03:56:58.446 --> 03:57:00.007]  Tell folks briefly your specials today.
[03:57:00.347 --> 03:57:02.689]  Yeah, well, I haven't changed my prices.
[03:57:02.689 --> 03:57:03.590]  $2.89 for the Frank coin.
[03:57:03.590 --> 03:57:05.651]  You get the International Forecaster for a year.
[03:57:05.651 --> 03:57:08.153]  The British Sovereign currently right now is $3.62.
[03:57:08.153 --> 03:57:11.576]  The Walking Liberty Halves, just an explosive deal.
[03:57:11.576 --> 03:57:11.596]  $10.83.
[03:57:11.596 --> 03:57:13.017]  Creature from Jekyll Island books for $26.45.
[03:57:13.017 --> 03:57:15.419]  You get a silver dollar with silver at $23.39.
[03:57:15.419 --> 03:57:16.040]  That's just a
[03:57:23.966 --> 03:57:25.247]  Phenomenal deal.
[03:57:25.247 --> 03:57:28.270]  And then, you know, just pretty much everything across the board.
[03:57:28.270 --> 03:57:30.691]  The Junksilver is really a good buy right now.
[03:57:30.691 --> 03:57:37.216]  The Bars of Gold, the Maple Leafs, the Krugerrands, you know, the Eagles.
[03:57:37.216 --> 03:57:41.860]  You know, you can't get them in large quantity, but the Buffalo Coins are a great buy.
[03:57:41.860 --> 03:57:45.343]  I mean, we're just, you know, we've got such a wide variety of stuff, Alex.
[03:57:45.343 --> 03:57:47.864]  I mean, we carry everything out there in the market.
[03:57:47.864 --> 03:57:52.408]  And, you know, if people are sitting there thinking about putting their IRAs into gold, we're handling that stuff.
[03:57:52.728 --> 03:57:55.672]  I mean, it's one of those times where, you know, like the U.S.
[03:57:55.672 --> 03:57:58.555]  Mint is running out of plant chance, premiums are rising.
[03:57:58.555 --> 03:57:59.356]  Call us at 800-686-2237, Alex.
[03:57:59.356 --> 03:58:00.418]  Now is the time to get in.
[03:58:04.480 --> 03:58:04.900]  800-686-2237.
[03:58:04.900 --> 03:58:09.741]  Don't screw around, folks.
[03:58:09.741 --> 03:58:12.362]  These are great smoking deals on gold and silver.
[03:58:12.362 --> 03:58:17.143]  On the silver half dollars, I think that's the best deal Ted's got.
[03:58:17.143 --> 03:58:17.543]  800-686-2237.
[03:58:17.543 --> 03:58:25.985]  And the tiny amount of money Ted makes, as I happen to know, is like 3-4% markup on these, and that's when gold was lower, so he's passing that on.
[03:58:25.985 --> 03:58:26.745]  I mean, that's nothing.
[03:58:26.745 --> 03:58:27.306]  800-686-2237.
[03:58:27.306 --> 03:58:32.247]  You can also get a creature from Jekyll Island with a free silver dollar.
[03:58:33.728 --> 03:58:36.752]  For $19.95, $6 shipping, I mean, that's losing money.
[03:58:36.752 --> 03:58:37.593]  Great job, crew.
[03:58:37.593 --> 03:58:39.535]  Russell Means Interview coming up now in fullwars.com.
