[00:00:00.381 --> 00:00:01.145]  I think so.
[00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:06.250]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:07.951]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.671 --> 00:00:09.792]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.453 --> 00:00:11.273]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.014 --> 00:00:12.934]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.595 --> 00:00:17.218]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.758 --> 00:00:21.901]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.744 --> 00:00:32.028]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen...
[00:00:34.054 --> 00:00:37.036]  The Friday edition of this transmission.
[00:00:37.176 --> 00:00:38.637]  Real Talk Radio.
[00:00:39.277 --> 00:00:42.739]  Real issues that actually affect you and your family.
[00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:46.361]  We're here live Monday through Friday.
[00:00:47.188 --> 00:00:48.189]  From 11 a.m.
[00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:49.029]  until 2 p.m.
[00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:54.533]  Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:00:54.593 --> 00:00:56.835]  Again, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:56.855 --> 00:01:01.358]  We're going to have wide open phones throughout this Friday edition today.
[00:01:01.378 --> 00:01:13.626]  We're going to go to your calls early in the next segment, kind of the C-SPAN format, where any newspaper report you wish to discuss, any television report you wish to comment on, you are welcome.
[00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:36.057]  President Bush gave his little speech last night there in the French Quarter of New Orleans, of Sin City, and he just promised the world, everybody, and they're talking about $200 billion, and the pundits said, this is wonderful.
[00:01:37.117 --> 00:01:38.697]  The Democratic leaders did.
[00:01:38.737 --> 00:01:43.279]  They said, he sounds like FDR, or he sounds like LBJ.
[00:01:45.504 --> 00:02:00.915]  But then the facts began to come out this morning that of the big contracts, over 70 of them that have been awarded in the New Orleans area, only two of them have been to local, that is, Louisiana companies.
[00:02:02.173 --> 00:02:08.776]  So Bush promises all these special considerations for local businesses to help them.
[00:02:09.276 --> 00:02:10.516]  Don't hold your breath.
[00:02:10.576 --> 00:02:14.338]  It's going to be a giant pork barrel sucking and bleeding.
[00:02:14.778 --> 00:02:19.920]  You wonder why Chris Matthews and all of them on TV were, well, this isn't going to be corrupt this time.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:27.303]  We're going to get on top of it and make sure there's no pork barrel and people with their hands out and carpetbaggers coming from the carpetbagger.
[00:02:28.368 --> 00:02:32.370]  And that's just so you all get behind the $200 million so they can suck it all up.
[00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.532]  I mean, I'm all for giving the people of this Gulf area a hand up.
[00:02:40.513 --> 00:02:45.535]  Then they had Lieutenant Governor Landrieu on, and he said, You will pay us 100%.
[00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:48.276]  You will give it to us.
[00:02:49.036 --> 00:02:53.318]  And I really didn't like that attitude from Mr. Landrieu.
[00:02:54.542 --> 00:02:58.386]  You know, I haven't watched television in years on a regular basis.
[00:02:58.866 --> 00:03:00.408]  I watch clips of it online.
[00:03:00.468 --> 00:03:02.770]  I read the synopsis of news reports.
[00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.073]  I read the text of news reports.
[00:03:05.133 --> 00:03:10.818]  But this hurricane has sucked me back into watching television at least 30 minutes a day.
[00:03:10.878 --> 00:03:18.486]  And I watched about two hours last night laying in bed, taking some allergy medicine so I was having trouble sleeping.
[00:03:19.235 --> 00:03:20.516]  Boy, did that stuff finally work.
[00:03:20.576 --> 00:03:22.197]  I finally found some allergy medicine that worked.
[00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:23.817]  I've got to give it a plug today.
[00:03:23.837 --> 00:03:25.498]  The problem is you're not going to be sleeping.
[00:03:26.018 --> 00:03:28.059]  But, side issue.
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.061]  And it was just unbelievable.
[00:03:31.101 --> 00:03:40.686]  And they had Tucker Carlson up there calling Bush basically a socialist and even beady-eyed Scarborough was saying, what's wrong with Bush?
[00:03:40.706 --> 00:03:43.167]  So this is just complete theater, folks.
[00:03:43.911 --> 00:03:45.792]  Bush is being hung out to dry.
[00:03:45.852 --> 00:03:49.754]  Meanwhile, the globalists are going to get more funding, more control, more police state.
[00:03:50.094 --> 00:03:51.455]  Bush has always been a puppet.
[00:03:51.775 --> 00:03:52.595]  He is a puppet.
[00:03:53.216 --> 00:03:55.617]  And they're turning on the puppet, at least for now.
[00:03:56.877 --> 00:04:00.099]  Later, I'm sure they'll resurrect him.
[00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:01.360]  I mean, they always do this.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.701]  It's like all the lavish worship of George Bush Sr.
[00:04:04.761 --> 00:04:06.582]  or of William Jefferson Clinton.
[00:04:06.842 --> 00:04:11.825]  But regardless, regardless, they're puppets.
[00:04:12.975 --> 00:04:16.756]  Congressman says hijacker documents destroyed.
[00:04:17.277 --> 00:04:19.597]  Well, what hasn't the government destroyed concerning 9-11?
[00:04:19.637 --> 00:04:24.159]  They've got to cover up the inside jobs, so we'll get into that.
[00:04:24.399 --> 00:04:28.300]  Britain proposes longer detention without charge in terror cases.
[00:04:28.821 --> 00:04:30.401]  Exactly what our government is doing.
[00:04:30.421 --> 00:04:38.344]  A church lady, 76 years old, starving to death, who was seen taking some sausage.
[00:04:39.164 --> 00:04:40.325]  She was caught by police.
[00:04:40.345 --> 00:04:41.145]  She's now in prison.
[00:04:42.461 --> 00:04:43.862]  Facing felony charges.
[00:04:45.424 --> 00:04:47.926]  Meanwhile, police videotape looting won't get in trouble.
[00:04:47.946 --> 00:04:51.089]  And police beating innocent people won't get in trouble.
[00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.973]  And police who didn't bring aid to the folks won't get in trouble.
[00:04:55.993 --> 00:04:58.796]  But then the nursing home administrators are going to go to the P.N.
[00:05:02.498 --> 00:05:05.360]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.300]  Hello, my friends.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.201]  Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:12.204]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.544 --> 00:05:19.288]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.608 --> 00:05:21.589]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:24.629]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:29.391]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.591 --> 00:05:34.032]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.232 --> 00:05:41.454]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.714 --> 00:05:44.134]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:05:44.295 --> 00:05:46.035]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.221]  The war on terrorism.
[00:06:04.541 --> 00:06:07.323]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:07.603 --> 00:06:11.746]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:12.167 --> 00:06:13.007]  So what do you do?
[00:06:13.327 --> 00:06:17.891]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:18.371 --> 00:06:20.513]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:20.993 --> 00:06:35.704]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:35.744 --> 00:06:42.789]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:47.553]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[00:06:47.993 --> 00:06:49.754]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:49.774 --> 00:06:49.995]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:07:02.265 --> 00:07:05.767]  Back in the 1950s, gasoline was only 25 cents a gallon.
[00:07:06.067 --> 00:07:07.428]  A hot dog was a nickel.
[00:07:07.668 --> 00:07:10.170]  And a luxury car was only 3,000 bucks.
[00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.071]  What happened to those prices?
[00:07:12.611 --> 00:07:14.312]  Well, the dollar was changed.
[00:07:15.893 --> 00:07:21.856]  In the 1960s, the government removed silver from the dollar and just started printing money out of thin air.
[00:07:22.316 --> 00:07:22.877]  The result?
[00:07:23.297 --> 00:07:24.558]  Inflation was born.
[00:07:25.058 --> 00:07:27.139]  Your dollar has lost 96% of its purchasing power.
[00:07:28.961 --> 00:07:30.608]  Start using the Silver Liberty Dollar!
[00:07:33.579 --> 00:07:38.922]  The Silver Liberty Dollar is a private legal currency backed by 100% pure silver.
[00:07:39.342 --> 00:07:44.505]  It's 100% inflation proof and is being used by over 100,000 people.
[00:07:44.945 --> 00:07:47.426]  Beat inflation with the Silver Liberty Dollar.

[00:07:49.387 --> 00:07:51.749]  That's LibertyDollar.org or call 1-800-NEW-DOLLAR now.
[00:08:01.014 --> 00:08:06.100]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.441 --> 00:08:08.704]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:17.617 --> 00:08:18.457]  Wide open phones today.
[00:08:18.477 --> 00:08:20.118]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:20.138 --> 00:08:20.198]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:20.218 --> 00:08:21.219]  It is Friday, the 16th day of September 2005.
[00:08:21.319 --> 00:08:24.100]  The websites are Infowars.com, Infowars.net, PrisonPlanet.tv, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:49.671]  I'm not going to spend all day on this.
[00:08:50.432 --> 00:09:16.028]  We have really serious news like new revelations concerning the Communist Chinese government not just killing political dissidents and selling their organs to the highest bidder, but melting down the murdered victims of this criminal state and then packaging it into many of the cosmetics that women apply to their faces and inject into their lips and that men inject into other unnamed places.
[00:09:18.915 --> 00:09:21.156]  We have serious issues like that to deal with.
[00:09:21.216 --> 00:09:28.918]  Or Bill Clinton launching this new expanded United Nations move for world government as we predicted so many years ago.
[00:09:29.378 --> 00:09:30.738]  We could see the pre-positioning.
[00:09:31.539 --> 00:09:43.482]  Or the moves now across the country from Texas to New London, Connecticut to start confiscating the property without just compensation because private interests want it.
[00:09:44.222 --> 00:09:46.683]  I mean, all of this is going on and happening.
[00:09:47.603 --> 00:09:54.509]  Judges are ruling they can secretly hold Americans for no reason, even if it's non-terror-related, and hold you in camps forever.
[00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:57.051]  All this is happening.
[00:09:58.933 --> 00:10:02.335]  And what is the country discussing George Bush's potty note?
[00:10:02.436 --> 00:10:03.617]  Can I go to the potty?
[00:10:05.158 --> 00:10:12.004]  And then the spin out of the White House is, and by the Drugs Report is, well, it looks like that photo was photoshopped.
[00:10:13.525 --> 00:10:16.007]  And then Reuters goes, yes, it was photoshopped.
[00:10:16.897 --> 00:10:20.380]  And then the media runs around the neocons, they altered it, they doctored it!
[00:10:21.441 --> 00:10:26.405]  And then you read what Reuters actually said about it, all they did was blow the photo up.
[00:10:27.406 --> 00:10:43.961]  I mean, many times, I'm a photographer in my own right, I don't claim to be a great one, but I've got a couple 35mm cameras, a couple digital cameras, and I take pictures of lizards in trees, and birds in bushes, and of trains at the train station, and the moon, and
[00:10:44.873 --> 00:10:45.914]  I like taking photos.
[00:10:45.974 --> 00:10:47.215]  I take photos all the time.
[00:10:47.296 --> 00:10:48.737]  I carry a camera in my pocket.
[00:10:50.499 --> 00:11:05.373]  And routinely, when I'm looking at a photo on the computer, and there's something off in the distance, say a herd of deer that I took a picture of at 200 yards, I will, well, the cameras themselves blow up the photos, digital cameras.
[00:11:05.713 --> 00:11:07.074]  I will zoom in on the deer.
[00:11:07.895 --> 00:11:09.717]  And that's all Reuters did...
[00:11:11.778 --> 00:11:12.579]  Is zoom in.
[00:11:12.619 --> 00:11:19.282]  I mean, obviously, Reuters wasn't allowed to get up near his gracious leaders, the supreme maximum leader.
[00:11:19.322 --> 00:11:25.766]  You can't get close to the supreme, dear, great leader from which all goodness flows.
[00:11:26.326 --> 00:11:33.590]  I mean, obviously, Reuters was up above him with a long lens and took a photo to begin with, and then they blew that up.
[00:11:34.851 --> 00:11:36.492]  Oh my gosh, it's doctored!
[00:11:36.852 --> 00:11:39.914]  So now, no one's going to focus on Bush having to ask permission
[00:11:40.606 --> 00:11:42.007]  I think I need to go potty.
[00:11:42.087 --> 00:11:43.227]  Is that okay?
[00:11:45.589 --> 00:11:48.030]  Just showing how handled he is.
[00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:49.811]  How managed he is.
[00:11:51.412 --> 00:11:56.114]  Instead of that, now the big debate is, Reuters blew that photo up.
[00:11:56.134 --> 00:11:58.495]  I mean, the neocons don't even say that.
[00:11:58.535 --> 00:12:00.156]  They say they altered it.
[00:12:00.756 --> 00:12:01.697]  Altered, I tell you!
[00:12:02.217 --> 00:12:02.777]  Did you hear?
[00:12:02.837 --> 00:12:03.918]  They altered it, I say!
[00:12:05.911 --> 00:12:09.854]  And then everyone focuses on, they altered it, they altered it, and don't even know the details.
[00:12:09.914 --> 00:12:15.338]  I mean, this is how they'll distract you with, oh, look, a meteorite's about to destroy the earth.
[00:12:15.538 --> 00:12:16.379]  Oh, never mind that.
[00:12:16.619 --> 00:12:18.180]  He's got a crooked toenail.
[00:12:18.601 --> 00:12:19.301]  Oh, dear.
[00:12:19.682 --> 00:12:19.942]  You know.
[00:12:21.943 --> 00:12:31.551]  It just shows how we will all distract ourselves from serious issues off onto petty ones.
[00:12:32.551 --> 00:12:34.573]  And now I've spent three minutes talking about
[00:12:35.791 --> 00:12:51.256]  Talking about the doctored, the altered, photoshopped, photographed by Reuters blew the photo of... I mean, it's just so evil.
[00:12:51.316 --> 00:12:52.696]  It's so Al-Qaeda-ish.
[00:12:55.477 --> 00:12:57.658]  And again, this whole thing in and of itself is a diversion.
[00:12:58.218 --> 00:13:00.899]  Bush is the most managed president we've ever had.
[00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:02.059]  It doesn't matter.
[00:13:02.419 --> 00:13:05.280]  They've all been puppets since they blew Kennedy's head off, folks.
[00:13:06.164 --> 00:13:09.266]  They've all been puppets since 1963.
[00:13:09.806 --> 00:13:11.106]  Everybody knows that.
[00:13:11.967 --> 00:13:13.107]  That's not debatable.
[00:13:14.328 --> 00:13:16.409]  And we need to just come to terms with that.
[00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:21.832]  I think I may need a bathroom break.
[00:13:23.733 --> 00:13:28.475]  Is that going to be possible for me to go potty?
[00:13:28.495 --> 00:13:34.678]  I mean, I don't know about you, but I don't ask anybody permission to go to the bathroom.
[00:13:36.332 --> 00:13:39.835]  And, again, I want the president's in command.
[00:13:41.056 --> 00:13:55.767]  Why would he ask Rice, who I don't think her intellect is much above Mr. Retarded's, I mean, why would he need to ask her permission?
[00:13:55.847 --> 00:13:59.510]  Okay, that's enough on this petty issue that doesn't matter, okay?
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.161]  It's just an illustration.
[00:14:01.581 --> 00:14:09.085]  Clinton launching First Global Summit, an initiative led by former President Clinton to tackle poverty.
[00:14:09.646 --> 00:14:11.747]  When you hear that, that means global taxation.
[00:14:12.467 --> 00:14:15.449]  Climate change, when you hear that, that means a global tax at the wellhead.
[00:14:15.789 --> 00:14:26.356]  And other worldwide issues is launching with a gathering of political leaders and activists who are promising to pitch in a must-have
[00:14:28.519 --> 00:14:32.502]  Put those pledges in writing, Clinton says.
[00:14:33.383 --> 00:14:35.845]  And participating is George Soros and many others.
[00:14:35.865 --> 00:14:38.167]  And then again, Tony Blair and many others.
[00:14:38.627 --> 00:14:39.788]  Condoleezza Rice, U.N.
[00:14:39.808 --> 00:14:43.111]  Secretary General Coffee Annen, Lord Clinton himself.
[00:14:43.511 --> 00:14:44.993]  And again, you have Bush Sr.
[00:14:45.153 --> 00:14:48.916]  joined at the hip in a lip lock with L. Clinton.
[00:14:49.907 --> 00:14:57.051]  You have Rupert Murdoch having lavish private meals for four hours at a time every week with Hillary Clinton.
[00:14:57.071 --> 00:15:00.493]  They're constantly together in secret consultations.
[00:15:01.554 --> 00:15:03.195]  And you trust Fox News.
[00:15:03.255 --> 00:15:05.776]  I mean, you love being conned, don't you?
[00:15:06.016 --> 00:15:08.197]  You just live to be scammed.
[00:15:09.538 --> 00:15:15.201]  Again, these neocon followers and these Democratic followers are one step up.
[00:15:15.602 --> 00:15:17.943]  One small step up.
[00:15:18.792 --> 00:15:25.396]  From the full-grown adults that believe WWF wrestling is real.
[00:15:27.658 --> 00:15:39.786]  I was in a grocery store last week buying milk, and a large fellow walks over to me who literally seemed like he had an IQ of about 75.
[00:15:40.026 --> 00:15:42.448]  And I apologize if he's listening.
[00:15:42.468 --> 00:15:45.770]  I'm not trying to be mean, but he goes, Hi, Alex!
[00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:46.751]  Hi, I like you!
[00:15:47.549 --> 00:15:48.409]  I thought he was being nice.
[00:15:48.429 --> 00:15:49.089]  I said, oh, thank you.
[00:15:49.109 --> 00:15:49.590]  He shook his hand.
[00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:50.850]  He goes, I'm a wrestler.
[00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.790]  I'm a wrestler.
[00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:52.831]  I'm a wrestler.
[00:15:53.071 --> 00:15:54.871]  He was like leaning over me.
[00:15:56.592 --> 00:15:58.412]  I don't like what you say about wrestling, basically.
[00:15:58.432 --> 00:15:59.333]  I just walked off.
[00:16:00.333 --> 00:16:05.374]  Because every time I've mentioned that wrestling's fake, I get emails going, you piece of trash.
[00:16:06.495 --> 00:16:09.916]  I'm 45 years old and I'll pound your head to the ground.
[00:16:10.036 --> 00:16:11.076]  Wrestling's real.
[00:16:11.636 --> 00:16:17.238]  This is like some weird thing for men that never really were masculine or men that never had any trials or tribulations.
[00:16:18.934 --> 00:16:24.277]  Men who never, I guess, had any type of coming-of-age rights that you went through.
[00:16:24.297 --> 00:16:30.220]  I guess that's kind of what getting into the military is, or being a fireman, or playing football.
[00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:35.802]  All these are kind of simulated male coming-of-age rights.
[00:16:35.862 --> 00:16:41.005]  It's like Native Americans would go out on their first raid, their first attack on another tribe.
[00:16:41.165 --> 00:16:42.946]  That was their coming-of-age rights.
[00:16:44.432 --> 00:16:47.515]  And so coming of ages is simulated watching wrestling.
[00:16:47.935 --> 00:17:00.986]  And wrestling, whereas believing in Bill Clinton and George Bush is only a step up from wrestling, believing in professional sports themselves is only a step up.
[00:17:01.386 --> 00:17:05.710]  Whereas most of professional sports are real, i.e.
[00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:07.812]  there's really a contest going on,
[00:17:08.667 --> 00:17:09.447]  It doesn't matter.
[00:17:09.567 --> 00:17:10.448]  It's not important.
[00:17:10.868 --> 00:17:22.131]  And it's a simulated male masculinity ritual where men no longer go out and actually earn money and do a good job and raise their children and instruct their young.
[00:17:22.351 --> 00:17:24.652]  That's manly, folks.
[00:17:24.832 --> 00:17:29.213]  Now they just simulate watching a simulated tribal war.
[00:17:31.397 --> 00:17:38.400]  Side issue, I just wanted to repeat that, and I'm not against sports, folks, especially if you participate in them.
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:47.263]  I think they're good if you're actually playing them, whether it's racquetball or tag football or tennis or swimming or track or whatever it is.
[00:17:47.683 --> 00:17:49.884]  But just don't let it be your god.
[00:17:50.965 --> 00:17:56.487]  Don't tell me you can't figure out politics, but you can figure out all the baseball scores for 50 years.
[00:17:57.819 --> 00:18:00.059]  Your country's going down the tubes, men.
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:17.523]  You might spend a few minutes a day knowing what's going on in the world, knowing what's going on with the dollar's value, know what's going on with DynCorp kidnapping children, or know what's going on with private security firms with foreign troops confiscating guns in New Orleans.
[00:18:18.623 --> 00:18:25.265]  You need to find out what's really going on in America and stop being weak, soft punks.
[00:18:25.285 --> 00:18:27.505]  All right, we're going to come back and take your calls.
[00:18:28.626 --> 00:18:28.906]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:18:28.946 --> 00:18:39.954]  And Clinton is calling for an energizing of world government and a global push, basically with Soros, for world taxation.
[00:18:40.454 --> 00:18:42.075]  The same thing Bush is pushing for.
[00:18:43.236 --> 00:18:44.997]  Now again, these guys are joined at the hip.
[00:18:45.117 --> 00:18:48.299]  Soros is supposedly this arch enemy of the Bushes.
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.660]  It's pure bull.
[00:18:50.761 --> 00:18:51.842]  Pure bull.
[00:18:52.759 --> 00:19:03.967]  Among the 800 luminaries expected at Manhattan Hotel for the three-day event, beginning Thursday, are British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Secretary of State Rice, UN Secretary Kofi Annan, and Lord Clinton himself.
[00:19:04.907 --> 00:19:08.009]  This conference is not about talk, it's about action, Carson said.
[00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:15.895]  Clinton has been very clear that if people aren't here to make a difference, then they are at the wrong conference.
[00:19:17.905 --> 00:19:23.049]  And they're pushing for world government and for expanded United Nations.
[00:19:23.229 --> 00:19:39.041]  And this is basically a move to energize power base to put Bill Clinton into the secretary generalship here in the next few years with coffee on on leaves or to create a new global body which Lord Clinton will sit over.
[00:19:40.091 --> 00:19:48.814]  And they're going to be double-teaming us the last few years of Bush's administration, it looks like, with Lord Bush here and Lord Clinton in Europe, and Lord Clinton in New York.
[00:19:48.874 --> 00:19:49.514]  God help us.
[00:19:51.295 --> 00:19:59.317]  So there's so much other news, folks, but we're going to take your calls when we get back as I rampage on this Friday transmission.
[00:20:02.618 --> 00:20:07.900]  Here it is, folks, the 2006 Red Book, the most comprehensive edition ever published.
[00:20:08.675 --> 00:20:12.316]  Midas Resources believes our clients should be as informed as possible.
[00:20:13.096 --> 00:20:14.556]  It includes the history of U.S.
[00:20:14.636 --> 00:20:18.757]  coins, the actual mintages, the grading standards.
[00:20:19.357 --> 00:20:20.998]  Learn the stability of real money.
[00:20:21.438 --> 00:20:23.498]  Protect yourself from fiat currencies.
[00:20:23.898 --> 00:20:25.359]  They are instruments of debt.
[00:20:25.679 --> 00:20:27.739]  Feel the comfort and safety of real money.
[00:20:28.279 --> 00:20:33.741]  Midas will send you the 2006 Red Book and a genuine silver dollar for just $22.95 delivered.

[00:20:37.838 --> 00:20:38.178]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:38.258 --> 00:20:40.299]  Don't be lost in a sea of confusion.
[00:20:40.319 --> 00:20:40.999]  Get the 2006 Red Book.
[00:20:41.059 --> 00:20:44.020]  Help steer your own financial ship.

[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:44.800]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:03.999 --> 00:21:08.503]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:21:08.843 --> 00:21:12.926]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:21:13.226 --> 00:21:13.787]  We listened.
[00:21:14.087 --> 00:21:19.071]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:21:19.351 --> 00:21:19.831]  We listened.
[00:21:20.211 --> 00:21:23.254]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:21:23.674 --> 00:21:24.214]  We listened.
[00:21:24.675 --> 00:21:27.517]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and
[00:21:29.377 --> 00:21:30.137]  We're good to go.
[00:21:30.157 --> 00:21:30.798]  We're good to go.
[00:21:54.022 --> 00:21:54.702]  We're good to go.
[00:22:23.951 --> 00:22:24.071]  5-1-6-8-7-3-6
[00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:43.370]  Call now.
[00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:45.232]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:23:03.403 --> 00:23:07.666]  Janet from JLS Research has been preparing a revolutionary new product.
[00:23:07.766 --> 00:23:10.888]  Listeners have been having tremendous success with no B.O.
[00:23:11.048 --> 00:23:16.071]  Now Janet would like to introduce to you her new product, like the Sweet Smell of Success Lotion Bar.
[00:23:16.171 --> 00:23:19.874]  Lotion bars are simply a lotion made into a solid bar rather than a liquid.
[00:23:19.914 --> 00:23:23.456]  You guys that are opposed to lotion bottles, this handmade bar is just for you.
[00:23:23.496 --> 00:23:25.396]  And the skin feels absolutely wonderful.
[00:23:46.261 --> 00:23:54.247]  Try the No-Bio deodorant, lotion bar, and the handmade all-natural soap and enjoy the sweet smell of success today by calling toll-free 1-888-881-NO-BIO.
[00:23:54.367 --> 00:23:55.108]  That's 1-888-881-6626.
[00:23:55.268 --> 00:23:56.089]  Or visit no-bio.com.
[00:24:10.118 --> 00:24:14.521]  I'm going to go back to the call.
[00:24:14.561 --> 00:24:17.784]  Sheldon, Brett, Johnny, Gary, and others that are patiently holding.
[00:24:21.747 --> 00:24:24.468]  And then I want to get into how the government's scapegoating.
[00:24:24.488 --> 00:24:31.474]  You know, they go and indict people who were running a nursing home for not doing a good job, which I agree with.
[00:24:31.534 --> 00:24:32.374]  It is despicable.
[00:24:33.055 --> 00:24:36.197]  Meanwhile, the government is basically invincible.
[00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:38.151]  They can do no wrong.
[00:24:38.531 --> 00:24:39.792]  They blocked food and water.
[00:24:40.412 --> 00:24:42.013]  2,000 people in one hospital.
[00:24:42.053 --> 00:24:43.194]  Over 40 people died.
[00:24:43.494 --> 00:24:44.694]  They're begging for food and water.
[00:24:44.714 --> 00:24:46.495]  Didn't get any food or water for four days.
[00:24:48.196 --> 00:24:49.217]  But that's okay.
[00:24:50.278 --> 00:24:55.881]  And FEMA's on record ordering the helicopters, ordering the military, ordering the police to not save people.
[00:24:56.261 --> 00:24:58.202]  Even the head of emergency management.
[00:24:59.473 --> 00:25:03.456]  There in New Orleans, wasn't allowed to get his own mother and she died.
[00:25:03.796 --> 00:25:05.437]  And I can't believe he followed orders.
[00:25:05.497 --> 00:25:06.578]  I mean, that's dutiful.
[00:25:07.179 --> 00:25:10.221]  Yes, Lord Government, I will let my mother die.
[00:25:10.581 --> 00:25:11.702]  Heil Hitler!
[00:25:12.162 --> 00:25:13.083]  Heil Hitler!
[00:25:13.143 --> 00:25:14.443]  I mean, you people are pathetic.
[00:25:15.004 --> 00:25:15.944]  I've really got to say it.
[00:25:16.725 --> 00:25:19.387]  I mean, you would just walk off the end of a cliff if they told you to.
[00:25:21.048 --> 00:25:23.590]  Let's go ahead and go to Sheldon in Tucson, Arizona.
[00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:23.930]  Go ahead.
[00:25:27.205 --> 00:25:27.825]  Hello, Alex?
[00:25:28.265 --> 00:25:28.606]  Yes, sir.
[00:25:28.666 --> 00:25:29.106]  Go ahead.
[00:25:29.366 --> 00:25:38.430]  Yeah, did you get my message from Violet last night about... Sir, I know you called me at my home at, and I don't know how you got my number, at like 1230 at night.
[00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:43.832]  And I didn't gripe at you when you called my house, but I mean, now you're asking if I got messages, and no, I didn't.
[00:25:44.712 --> 00:25:51.295]  Oh, well, that was the tail end of the Larry King show with Dave Gerken on, so... Do me a favor.
[00:25:51.315 --> 00:25:52.856]  Don't call my house at 1230 again.
[00:25:53.316 --> 00:25:53.876]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[00:25:55.519 --> 00:25:58.602]  What I wanted to tell you, Alex, was on Frank Whalen's show this morning.
[00:25:58.622 --> 00:26:00.503]  Have you heard the news about what was on his show?
[00:26:00.944 --> 00:26:02.785]  No, and I appreciate your call and take care.
[00:26:03.406 --> 00:26:04.767]  I mean, my phone rings last night.
[00:26:04.787 --> 00:26:10.772]  I don't even know the person that's calling me, and then now they call in again on the show.
[00:26:10.832 --> 00:26:15.016]  And I try to be nice about it, and it just becomes irritating.
[00:26:15.916 --> 00:26:21.221]  This broadcast is not for just all this basic weirdness.
[00:26:22.778 --> 00:26:25.820]  Let's go ahead and I'm sorry if I sound irritated.
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:31.763]  It's just I'm sitting there trying to go to sleep and the phone's ringing and I end up staying up until 2 in the morning.
[00:26:32.463 --> 00:26:34.764]  I just have trouble figuring it out, folks.
[00:26:34.885 --> 00:26:37.306]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brett in Kansas.
[00:26:37.346 --> 00:26:37.926]  Brett, go ahead.
[00:26:37.946 --> 00:26:38.526]  You're on the air.
[00:26:39.047 --> 00:26:39.827]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[00:26:40.147 --> 00:26:40.467]  Hi.
[00:26:41.368 --> 00:26:46.831]  I am an author and I was just wondering if I could get your expertise on something.
[00:26:46.851 --> 00:26:49.172]  I was wondering if you knew of any novels or fiction
[00:26:49.642 --> 00:26:52.717]  Folks with an anti-NWO message or an NWO message.
[00:26:54.221 --> 00:27:00.906]  Well, I mean, there's thousands of books with a pro-New World Order message, and there's thousands with an anti-New World Order message.
[00:27:00.926 --> 00:27:03.929]  Yeah, I mean, I was just wondering... But you're talking about a novel form?
[00:27:04.309 --> 00:27:08.352]  Yeah, like a novel form, just, you know, just kind of your recommendations.
[00:27:09.033 --> 00:27:12.355]  You know, I have to tell you, when I read fiction, I just go for fiction.
[00:27:12.456 --> 00:27:16.679]  I don't... When I'm reading a book about the New World Order, I don't really read a fiction.
[00:27:17.099 --> 00:27:21.543]  So I'm not really... I mean, I'm sure a hundred people will call in with great novels now, but...
[00:27:22.544 --> 00:27:28.531]  I'm not really familiar with books about the New World Order in novel form.
[00:27:29.231 --> 00:27:29.792]  Sure, yeah.
[00:27:30.273 --> 00:27:33.977]  I'm writing one right now, actually set in the 1960s.
[00:27:33.997 --> 00:27:36.640]  Anyway, I'll send you a copy when it comes out.
[00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:42.627]  But anyway, I was just wanting some other input so that I could write the best novel I could, you know?
[00:27:44.497 --> 00:27:46.598]  Alright, I really appreciate the call, sir.
[00:27:46.658 --> 00:27:47.298]  Take care.
[00:27:47.538 --> 00:27:49.658]  Let's go ahead and continue with open phones.
[00:27:50.578 --> 00:27:53.859]  Let's talk to Johnny in Connecticut.
[00:27:53.899 --> 00:27:54.319]  Go ahead.
[00:27:54.339 --> 00:27:55.720]  Oh, it's Kentucky, man.
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:57.400]  I'm in Kentucky.
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:58.280]  Thank you, Mr. Jones.
[00:27:59.601 --> 00:28:07.863]  From time to time, you beat the drum about the autism epidemic we've got going on here in America, and we just really appreciate that, those of us that are in the field and working with it.
[00:28:08.583 --> 00:28:13.124]  A while back, I sent you an article from a periodical where they're now
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.201]  Open these kids up with value.
[00:28:16.102 --> 00:28:20.646]  And this evil, it's just got to stop.
[00:28:20.806 --> 00:28:23.088]  I mean, this is going too far, Mr. Dennison.
[00:28:23.128 --> 00:28:26.191]  Like I said, I really do appreciate how you bring it up every now and then.
[00:28:27.492 --> 00:28:36.060]  You know, I don't want to have to start this, but Rush Limbaugh about ten years ago said, everybody's thanking me too much, just say ditto.
[00:28:36.847 --> 00:28:40.949]  And I'm not going to sit here and say that, but there's so much news, so much information.
[00:28:41.409 --> 00:28:44.890]  Most of these neocons make you grovel to them when you call in.
[00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:46.151]  I don't want that.
[00:28:46.491 --> 00:28:47.031]  I hear you.
[00:28:47.051 --> 00:28:53.253]  So please, sir, you don't need to thank me for talking about the fact that 20 years ago, 1 in 25,000 children...
[00:28:55.374 --> 00:28:56.894]  Had autism, now it's 1 in 168.
[00:28:56.974 --> 00:28:58.595]  There you go.
[00:28:58.655 --> 00:29:02.255]  And it's totally proven that the thimerosal is one of the causes of this.
[00:29:02.596 --> 00:29:06.256]  And by the way, they haven't taken the thimerosal, the mercury, out of them.
[00:29:06.276 --> 00:29:09.097]  They've actually increased the level of thimerosal.
[00:29:09.417 --> 00:29:10.117]  That's public.
[00:29:10.497 --> 00:29:11.197]  That's admitted.
[00:29:12.257 --> 00:29:22.519]  And then at the same time, they are doing all sorts of other things with the vaccines that are just incredibly dangerous, as you know, there in Kentucky, Johnny.
[00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:24.880]  The only way to get it out is to keep on repeating it.
[00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:29.491]  Hey, Chertoff in Russian means son of the devil.
[00:29:30.391 --> 00:29:31.692]  You know, I've heard that, yes.
[00:29:31.772 --> 00:29:38.654]  Well, his actions certainly show him to be of his father, the devil, old Beelzebub, old serpent.
[00:29:39.574 --> 00:29:41.035]  Anything else you want to add, my friend?
[00:29:41.055 --> 00:29:42.115]  Just have a good weekend, man.
[00:29:42.295 --> 00:29:42.635]  You too.
[00:29:42.655 --> 00:29:43.955]  I appreciate your call, Johnny.
[00:29:43.995 --> 00:29:45.016]  Sorry I got the state wrong.
[00:29:45.856 --> 00:29:48.357]  All right, we'll be back with more calls and a bunch of news.
[00:29:52.058 --> 00:29:52.958]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.438 --> 00:29:54.959]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.942 --> 00:29:58.725]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.588 --> 00:30:08.373]  The 5th Annual Seniors Expo is coming to Mystic Lake Casino Hotel, September 19th and 20th.
[00:30:08.593 --> 00:30:11.156]  Door prizes, free drawings, and non-stop fun.
[00:30:11.396 --> 00:30:12.217]  Featuring the Ms.
[00:30:12.237 --> 00:30:20.384]  Minnesota Senior Pageant, Dr. Dale Anderson, who prescribes laughter for health, the Plymouth Playhouse Church Basement Ladies, the Silver Sneakers, and more.
[00:30:20.844 --> 00:30:25.207]  Learn all about the new Medicare prescription plan from the Social Security Administration.
[00:30:25.227 --> 00:30:26.367]  See a fashion show.
[00:30:26.648 --> 00:30:29.189]  Have fun with the bees and Mariner and the Magic Man.
[00:30:29.449 --> 00:30:30.990]  There's something new every hour.
[00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:34.612]  All this plus hundreds of products, drawings, and fantastic giveaways.
[00:30:34.632 --> 00:30:38.714]  The 5th Annual Seniors Expo celebrates all that's good about getting older.
[00:30:39.015 --> 00:30:41.856]  It's all happening at Mystic Lake Casino Hotel, September 19th and 20th.
[00:30:43.257 --> 00:30:48.424]  For discount tickets, visit 101Expo.com or call 612-798-7256.
[00:30:48.944 --> 00:30:56.734]  Sponsored in part by Mystic Lake Casino Hotel, KSTC, KSTP, Medica, and Ebenezer.
[00:30:57.015 --> 00:31:00.139]  Save the date September 19th and 20th at Mystic Lake.
[00:31:02.024 --> 00:31:05.585]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:31:05.625 --> 00:31:06.145]  are located?
[00:31:06.345 --> 00:31:09.726]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:31:09.946 --> 00:31:14.668]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:31:14.948 --> 00:31:19.949]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[00:31:20.089 --> 00:31:20.790]  We're good to go.
[00:31:40.387 --> 00:31:44.268]  Get Prudent Places USA for only $49 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:32:02.142 --> 00:32:04.923]  Let's face it, we know that we're less than perfect when it comes to our diets.
[00:32:05.063 --> 00:32:10.124]  We all eat sugar, saturated fats, salt, probably don't get the exercise we should, and we all have to deal with daily stress.
[00:32:10.344 --> 00:32:16.526]  And all the vitamins and supplements in the world won't help you if your immune system is compromised because of our less than perfect eating habits and lifestyles.
[00:32:16.786 --> 00:32:22.428]  That's why Agaricus Bio is the number one dietary supplement that you should consider an absolute must if you're going to take any at all.
[00:32:22.688 --> 00:32:28.212]  The immune system is your body's first line of defense against disease, and Agaricus Bio strengthens and supports your immune system.
[00:32:28.452 --> 00:32:32.295]  That's why it's become the most popular immune support system for people and pets in Japan.
[00:32:32.315 --> 00:32:37.599]  A one-month supply of Agaricus Bio is only $34.95, and that's a small price to pay considering the alternatives.
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:38.600]  Call 877-817-9829.
[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:44.164]  That's 877-817-9829 or visit thepowermall.com.
[00:32:44.184 --> 00:32:48.748]  How many times have you heard about people taking vitamin C and other vitamins and supplements to fight a cold?
[00:32:48.968 --> 00:32:51.910]  Well, with a Garricus bio, you might not catch that cold in the first place.
[00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:56.972]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit thepowermall.com and order today.
[00:32:57.212 --> 00:32:59.614]  A Garricus bio, because healthy is what you want to be.
[00:33:06.477 --> 00:33:08.398]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:08.878 --> 00:33:11.620]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:15.811 --> 00:33:19.552]  Bush vows biggest relief effort ever.
[00:33:19.612 --> 00:33:23.154]  President Bush has promised the U.S.
[00:33:23.194 --> 00:33:29.316]  government will do and spend whatever it takes to rebuild the hurricane-hit Gulf Coast.
[00:33:29.376 --> 00:33:42.340]  Speaking with his minions, President Bush, after his speech, continued to reiterate that we're going to get the region back on its feet.
[00:33:43.155 --> 00:33:45.677]  And this is one of their favorite little things they do.
[00:33:45.797 --> 00:33:54.884]  They'll act like they're saying something that they know is really on camera, but they act like they don't know it's on camera.
[00:33:55.245 --> 00:34:00.869]  And then we get some type of little window into what they're really thinking, into what they're really doing.
[00:34:02.148 --> 00:34:10.530]  Speaking from New Orleans, Mr. Bush said billions of dollars would be spent on the reconstruction and unprecedented response to an unprecedented crisis.
[00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:17.231]  New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin said three districts would reopen next week and the French Quarter a week later.
[00:34:18.291 --> 00:34:22.172]  But just a few days ago, it was nobody will be in there for six months to a year.
[00:34:22.272 --> 00:34:23.332]  Give us your guns.
[00:34:23.752 --> 00:34:25.412]  You're not allowed to be in the city.
[00:34:25.452 --> 00:34:26.552]  You must leave.
[00:34:27.973 --> 00:34:30.053]  And people just refused to follow the orders.
[00:34:30.891 --> 00:34:41.217]  I mean, they went out and grabbed a few old ladies and a few old men and put it on the news and thought that that would scare everybody into following orders and that they would then leave, but it didn't work.
[00:34:41.297 --> 00:34:45.900]  So now they've caved in and said, okay, you can go ahead and come back on into the city now.
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:47.561]  Everything's okay.
[00:34:49.258 --> 00:35:00.030]  But still, this whole thing has been used as a drill for martial law to acclimate the public, to accept troops on the streets, to accept greater FEMA roles in our lives.
[00:35:00.091 --> 00:35:03.474]  But I say that their little test has failed.
[00:35:03.935 --> 00:35:06.478]  Their little drill has failed big time.
[00:35:07.239 --> 00:35:08.680]  But of course it's multifaceted.
[00:35:08.721 --> 00:35:30.702]  Now they want $200 billion to, quote, rebuild the region, and already out of the dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of contracts that have been given for the cleanup, only a couple of them were given to Louisiana companies, much less New Orleans companies.
[00:35:31.224 --> 00:35:40.074]  So this talk about this revitalization Gulf economic development region, very, very suspicious.
[00:35:40.154 --> 00:35:49.644]  It's going to be a huge, I mean it always is, but I would say this is going to take the cake for just huge out of control pork barrel and sweetheart deals.
[00:35:49.684 --> 00:35:50.585]  I mean look at Iraq.
[00:35:51.681 --> 00:35:53.662]  We had presidents that had to leave office.
[00:35:53.682 --> 00:35:56.743]  We've had speakers of the House that have had to leave office.
[00:35:56.763 --> 00:36:07.627]  We've had politicians go down in disgrace for one one-hundredth of the war profiteering that this administration has engaged in.
[00:36:07.647 --> 00:36:09.608]  But they're given a free pass on it.
[00:36:11.308 --> 00:36:16.750]  Meanwhile, talking about 9-11, Congressman says hijacker documents destroyed.
[00:36:17.871 --> 00:36:20.872]  Now remember, the FAA tapes were ordered destroyed.
[00:36:21.992 --> 00:36:24.334]  The FBI files have been destroyed.
[00:36:24.974 --> 00:36:26.455]  The records get destroyed.
[00:36:26.536 --> 00:36:41.447]  I mean, at every turn, they haul the steel away under guard to large barges, taking the rubble, including body parts, to communist China for smelting.
[00:36:42.127 --> 00:36:50.934]  A GPS satellite tracker was put on each piece of metal, and if a truck driver even stopped for 20 minutes for a hot dog or a hamburger, they were fired.
[00:36:51.664 --> 00:36:55.847]  Because those beams were blown apart by precision charges.
[00:36:56.268 --> 00:36:57.249]  All the evidence shows it.
[00:36:57.729 --> 00:37:10.059]  So we have this long train of cover-ups and lies and declaring national security on the firefighter transmission tapes and the police and other EMS tapes.
[00:37:11.425 --> 00:37:12.466]  And now we have this.
[00:37:12.646 --> 00:37:17.350]  We have them telling FBI agent Robert Wright, you'll be arrested if you tell the people what you know.
[00:37:17.991 --> 00:37:21.474]  And then all he can say is, the Bushes vacation with the Bin Ladens.
[00:37:22.435 --> 00:37:23.275]  And then we have this.
[00:37:23.335 --> 00:37:26.018]  I mean, literally, folks, there are hundreds of other examples.
[00:37:26.338 --> 00:37:28.420]  I'm trying to just give you a few from memory.
[00:37:29.481 --> 00:37:33.124]  But this is the Associated Press carried by USA Today today.
[00:37:34.025 --> 00:37:37.548]  Congressman says hijacker documents destroyed.
[00:37:38.408 --> 00:37:52.715]  A Pentagon employee was ordered to destroy documents that identified Muhammad Atta as a terrorist two years before the 2001 attacks, a congressman said Thursday.
[00:37:53.775 --> 00:38:04.300]  Again, a Pentagon employee was ordered to destroy documents that identified Muhammad Atta as a terrorist two years before the 2001 attacks, a congressman said Thursday.
[00:38:05.123 --> 00:38:18.811]  The employee is prepared to testify next week before the Senate Judiciary Committee and was expected to name the person who ordered him to destroy the large volume of documents to Representative Kurt Weldon, Republican from Pennsylvania.
[00:38:20.092 --> 00:38:24.115]  And you can bet this is going to be allowed because it was Bill Clinton, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:24.535 --> 00:38:29.578]  Somebody in Bill Clinton's administration had ordered it, so see, now it's going to be more partisan politics.
[00:38:31.167 --> 00:38:35.009]  Which we've always said Bill Clinton protected Al-Qaeda.
[00:38:35.449 --> 00:38:49.034]  We've always talked about how Jordan and Sudan and Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan all wanted to nab bin Laden and Bill Clinton said no, no, no, no, no.
[00:38:50.395 --> 00:38:51.916]  Because he's unoperative.
[00:38:52.716 --> 00:38:56.618]  We've had the former head of the main U.S.
[00:38:56.698 --> 00:38:59.999]  embassy in Saudi Arabia in Riyadh on this program.
[00:39:00.808 --> 00:39:06.433]  Who was ordered to let dozens of known terrorists, including Anna and others, into the country.
[00:39:06.673 --> 00:39:08.494]  He said, they're on a terrorist watch list.
[00:39:08.935 --> 00:39:12.518]  And they said, it's part of a secret anti-terror training op.
[00:39:13.759 --> 00:39:15.200]  These men work for us.
[00:39:16.541 --> 00:39:18.803]  I had Springman on three years ago, folks.
[00:39:21.245 --> 00:39:22.826]  Who was the head of the embassy.
[00:39:22.886 --> 00:39:23.867]  Do you understand?
[00:39:23.947 --> 00:39:26.389]  Being told, let them in.
[00:39:26.409 --> 00:39:28.591]  They work for us.
[00:39:30.854 --> 00:39:32.475]  Do you understand that?
[00:39:33.516 --> 00:39:45.985]  I'm trying to be obnoxious here, but of course we're going to have government agents coming forward now saying that the Clinton administration ordered them to destroy files naming Ada as a terrorist.
[00:39:46.025 --> 00:39:59.174]  See, the whole government is an evil, so when good CIA or good defense intelligence or good FBI or good state police get evidence that somebody's a terrorist and it goes into a file, it's got to be expunged.
[00:40:00.345 --> 00:40:01.886]  Because they had plans for ATTA.
[00:40:02.166 --> 00:40:04.188]  Who was part of the drill?
[00:40:04.668 --> 00:40:06.530]  Part of a simulated hijacking drill.
[00:40:07.371 --> 00:40:27.206]  Actor James Woods went public days after 9-11, a week before 9-11, or two weeks before he was on a flight from New York to L.A., and there were these four guys on board, including ATTA, simulating hijacking, and he got off the plane, freaked out, and told police, and the FBI came to him and said, you shut your mouth about this or you'll be arrested.
[00:40:27.486 --> 00:40:29.248]  This is national security, buddy.
[00:40:31.559 --> 00:40:32.700]  I mean, come on, folks.
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:40.486]  And then they leave cars with their admissions in it and leave Korans at the topless bar while they swill whiskey.
[00:40:40.766 --> 00:40:42.568]  I'm going to fly planes into buildings tomorrow.
[00:40:42.888 --> 00:40:49.713]  They were told to go out and drill and to, quote, test the agencies and see if they were flagrant about this plan.
[00:40:49.974 --> 00:40:52.456]  They thought they were simulating Operation Bojinka.
[00:40:53.456 --> 00:40:57.960]  And they were told they went out and flagrantly did all this to test and see if they got busted.
[00:40:58.999 --> 00:41:06.683]  And boy, did they have a surprise when the gas was released and those planes locked down, and of course they were all dead before they started slamming into buildings.
[00:41:06.744 --> 00:41:10.246]  And folks, that's what happened, okay?
[00:41:10.566 --> 00:41:11.546]  It's in martial law.
[00:41:11.586 --> 00:41:12.227]  We detail it.
[00:41:12.507 --> 00:41:13.187]  We document it.
[00:41:13.227 --> 00:41:14.948]  It's totally provable.
[00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:19.071]  That's what happened.
[00:41:19.131 --> 00:41:20.552]  That's what all the evidence shows.
[00:41:21.012 --> 00:41:23.133]  You have to be a conspiracy theorist not to believe it.
[00:41:23.173 --> 00:41:24.534]  You have to be a coincidence theorist.
[00:41:25.214 --> 00:41:28.076]  So now here's another one, just to add to the piles of hundreds.
[00:41:29.395 --> 00:41:36.420]  And again, it shows not that it's Bill Clinton's fault, or not that it's George Bush's fault, that they're just idiots, as you're going to hear in the news.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:37.341]  No!
[00:41:38.281 --> 00:41:41.784]  It shows they're in collusion carrying out the operation.
[00:41:44.686 --> 00:41:47.507]  Remember, all the FBI agents that tried to bust them and stop them.
[00:41:47.868 --> 00:41:49.469]  Hey, they're planning to fly planes into buildings.
[00:41:49.489 --> 00:41:49.889]  We've got them.
[00:41:49.909 --> 00:41:50.690]  Let me search the computer.
[00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:51.410]  No!
[00:41:52.091 --> 00:41:52.551]  No!
[00:41:53.091 --> 00:41:53.972]  You're not allowed to.
[00:41:53.992 --> 00:41:58.435]  Head of Counterterrorism, Mr. O'Neill, FBI agent,
[00:41:59.346 --> 00:42:03.090]  He told the British News a week after he resigned, well, why did you resign?
[00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:08.495]  Well, because our government's going to let bin Laden attack the trade towers as a pretext to invade Afghanistan.
[00:42:08.835 --> 00:42:10.217]  See, he didn't even get the full picture.
[00:42:11.338 --> 00:42:12.619]  They got rid of him on 9-11.
[00:42:14.941 --> 00:42:17.664]  So everywhere you have this, folks...
[00:42:19.056 --> 00:42:29.258]  A Pentagon employee was ordered to destroy documents that identified Mohammed Atta as a terrorist two years before the 2001 attacks, a congressman said Thursday.
[00:42:29.278 --> 00:42:31.718]  And it goes on.
[00:42:31.778 --> 00:42:42.940]  The employee is prepared to testify next week before the Senate Judiciary Committee and was expected to name the person who ordered him to destroy the large volume of documents, Representative Kurt Weldon, Republican, Pennsylvania.
[00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:47.141]  Weldon declined to name the employee, citing confidentiality matters.
[00:42:47.181 --> 00:42:48.381]  Weldon described the documents.
[00:42:49.523 --> 00:42:56.225]  That's 2.5 terabytes as much as one-fourth of all the printed materials in the Library of Congress, he added.
[00:42:59.747 --> 00:43:06.589]  A Senate Judiciary Committee said that the witness for Wednesday's hearing had not been finalized and could not confirm Weldon's comments.
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:22.330]  Weldon has said that out of the mastermind of the attacks on September 11th and three other hijackers were identified, 99, by a classified military intelligence unit known as Able Danger, which identified and determined that there could be members of an al-Qaeda cell.
[00:43:22.871 --> 00:43:24.932]  And again, this shows Bush knew about all this.
[00:43:24.972 --> 00:43:26.033]  It shows Clinton knew about all this.
[00:43:26.333 --> 00:43:27.174]  Of course they knew.
[00:43:27.194 --> 00:43:33.719]  They had the specific memo two weeks before saying bin Laden determined to attack, use jetliners in the buildings.
[00:43:34.139 --> 00:43:38.181]  And then Rice, we had never heard, we had never seen, we had never imagined.
[00:43:38.401 --> 00:43:42.343]  When two weeks before at the ranch, she's reading this report to Bush.
[00:43:42.383 --> 00:43:43.824]  Well, of course he knew about it.
[00:43:45.525 --> 00:43:54.090]  That's like going to the Mafia Don and going, Mafia Don, our men in this Capo region are going to be hijacking some trucks tonight.
[00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:58.852]  They're going to be carjacking.
[00:43:58.932 --> 00:44:00.513]  I mean, oh really?
[00:44:00.933 --> 00:44:02.254]  Tell me something I didn't know.
[00:44:04.813 --> 00:44:07.274]  Of course, Bush is so out of the loop asking who can use the potty.
[00:44:08.915 --> 00:44:11.076]  I've said the way he sat there about the little goat story.
[00:44:11.136 --> 00:44:13.157]  I mean, you know, he's clearly a puppet.
[00:44:13.177 --> 00:44:14.917]  Maybe Bush doesn't know.
[00:44:16.158 --> 00:44:17.599]  I mean, he certainly knows now.
[00:44:18.659 --> 00:44:20.500]  I mean, again, we have a government above this government.
[00:44:22.461 --> 00:44:23.601]  All right, I'm ranting and raving.
[00:44:23.881 --> 00:44:26.783]  That is just a couple articles, and I've literally got about 100 of them.
[00:44:26.943 --> 00:44:28.724]  Here's some of the other ones.
[00:44:29.164 --> 00:44:29.524]  British...
[00:44:31.903 --> 00:44:35.545]  Government proposes longer detention without charge in terror cases.
[00:44:36.446 --> 00:44:42.370]  Sausage, looted or not, puts elderly church leader in prison.
[00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:42.430]  A.P.
[00:44:43.330 --> 00:44:48.533]  Marilyn Matten undoubtedly stands out in the prison where she has been held to the 73 year old church.
[00:44:51.383 --> 00:44:54.185]  Never before in trouble with the law.
[00:44:54.526 --> 00:44:56.647]  Now sleeps among hardened criminals.
[00:44:56.727 --> 00:44:58.709]  Her bail is set at $50,000.
[00:44:59.049 --> 00:45:06.375]  Her offense, police say, the grandmother from New Orleans took $63 in goods from a looted deli the day after Katrina struck.
[00:45:08.076 --> 00:45:15.242]  So she went into a deli and got ten sandwiches, which is valued at $60.
[00:45:15.282 --> 00:45:16.683]  $63, and she's facing...
[00:45:20.299 --> 00:45:34.189]  And again, folks, we have the cops openly with their faces and their badges in New Orleans loading giant shopping carts full of stereos and high heels and T-shirts and telling reporters back off.
[00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:38.352]  Nothing's going to happen to those guys because they're gods.
[00:45:38.853 --> 00:45:39.633]  We're slaves.
[00:45:39.793 --> 00:45:40.374]  They're gods.
[00:45:42.715 --> 00:45:46.098]  But they're going to prosecute old ladies, folks.
[00:45:46.118 --> 00:45:47.419]  They always target the weakest.
[00:45:48.485 --> 00:45:52.949]  And, you know, if I was stuck in New Orleans and I didn't have any food, of course I do have food.
[00:45:53.489 --> 00:45:54.210]  I wouldn't have to.
[00:45:55.271 --> 00:45:58.473]  Waterproof containers, but freeze-dried.
[00:45:58.533 --> 00:46:02.176]  But if I didn't have food and my family was hungry, you bet I'd go break down doors and take food.
[00:46:04.078 --> 00:46:05.259]  You bet I'd go to Walmart.
[00:46:05.279 --> 00:46:06.680]  I'd go to Target.
[00:46:07.381 --> 00:46:08.281]  I'd go to Kroger.
[00:46:08.341 --> 00:46:09.362]  I'd go to HEB.
[00:46:09.402 --> 00:46:11.544]  I'd go wherever I had to and get food.
[00:46:12.426 --> 00:46:14.627]  But see, they didn't bring food in for four days.
[00:46:14.888 --> 00:46:15.788]  Her case, a day and a half.
[00:46:16.088 --> 00:46:17.309]  They didn't bring food in for four days.
[00:46:17.369 --> 00:46:19.410]  People went after food, and they called them looters.
[00:46:19.711 --> 00:46:22.853]  And yeah, there were scumbag drug addicts and some real looters, of course.
[00:46:23.333 --> 00:46:25.174]  But the other people were just foraging for food.
[00:46:25.374 --> 00:46:26.555]  They did this on purpose.
[00:46:26.615 --> 00:46:28.116]  FEMA has war-gamed all this.
[00:46:28.436 --> 00:46:30.297]  They knew what happened.
[00:46:31.458 --> 00:46:34.220]  And then they give you the spectacle, and now they get to have the police state.
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:37.502]  And they're now charging these people that were running this nursing home
[00:46:40.055 --> 00:46:45.377]  Twenty-something people died at one place, and it is horrible that the managers didn't go there and help them.
[00:46:46.698 --> 00:46:47.978]  It is horrible that they left.
[00:46:49.599 --> 00:47:01.583]  But it's even worse that a congressman, two days into it, had the National Guard flying him around with armored truck convoys under the helicopters to get his paintings and safety deposit box out of his house.
[00:47:02.824 --> 00:47:09.086]  And that piece of trash, and I've got stronger language for him, but I won't use it, he needs to be charged
[00:47:10.518 --> 00:47:12.140]  With just criminal neglect.
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:14.522]  He needs to spend at least 10 years in the pen.
[00:47:14.842 --> 00:47:15.463]  But he won't.
[00:47:15.563 --> 00:47:16.324]  Don't you worry.
[00:47:16.624 --> 00:47:19.227]  He'll probably get some big fat building contracts or something.
[00:47:19.767 --> 00:47:27.315]  And FEMA that jammed the ham radios, that jammed the emergency communications, that jammed all the police frequencies.
[00:47:27.675 --> 00:47:31.279]  We need to find out who gave that order and they need to be charged with murder.
[00:47:32.262 --> 00:47:40.709]  And the people that went and cut police communications lines, the FEMA, they need to be charged with just treason, high treason, in time of disaster.
[00:47:43.071 --> 00:47:52.198]  I mean, that's the equivalent of somebody stabbing the tires of the fire department vehicles and then going and setting a fire.
[00:47:53.539 --> 00:47:55.661]  It's unspeakable, folks.
[00:47:56.822 --> 00:48:01.666]  The government's going to go crucify a bunch of people who have not done one-tenth of what they've done
[00:48:03.919 --> 00:48:06.401]  Let's go to... Who's up next here?
[00:48:07.882 --> 00:48:09.663]  Gary in Tennessee and then Kurt.
[00:48:10.403 --> 00:48:11.584]  Gary, go ahead and finish up.
[00:48:11.604 --> 00:48:17.088]  Then we're going to get a report from Steve Mason on the anti-Minutemen crowd here in Austin.
[00:48:17.328 --> 00:48:18.008]  Go ahead, Gary.
[00:48:18.208 --> 00:48:18.929]  Hey, Alex.
[00:48:18.969 --> 00:48:19.309]  How are you?
[00:48:19.669 --> 00:48:19.889]  Good.
[00:48:19.929 --> 00:48:20.290]  Go ahead.
[00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:20.770]  All right.
[00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:23.191]  I've got one question and two topics I want you to touch upon.
[00:48:23.211 --> 00:48:31.757]  The question is, this deal over in Louisiana with the mayor talking about the military, different firearms, different things, you know,
[00:48:32.441 --> 00:48:38.104]  You're talking with the first one, you're talking about Texas Tech three years ago when the plague came up this thing?
[00:49:01.159 --> 00:49:07.883]  No, they were talking on the news here a few nights ago about three mice that were injected with the bubonic plague.
[00:49:09.424 --> 00:49:13.247]  They came up missing shortly after, and now they're talking about this winter.
[00:49:13.267 --> 00:49:17.290]  Oh, I did hear that report.
[00:49:17.370 --> 00:49:18.250]  I haven't seen it.
[00:49:18.711 --> 00:49:25.796]  Number one, bubonic plague is very weak if you've got a lot of vitamin C and other things like garlic.
[00:49:26.356 --> 00:49:27.477]  Also, you get it.
[00:49:28.146 --> 00:49:31.447]  From fleas, generally, that are on rats.
[00:49:31.947 --> 00:49:39.488]  So if you don't have a rodent problem combined with a flea problem, I'm not worried about a couple of mice that have bubonic plague.
[00:49:39.768 --> 00:49:48.050]  Bubonic plague does show up every few years, the bacterial infection in humans in the United States, but it's readily treatable.
[00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:51.831]  It was really bad, though, in flea-infested animals.
[00:49:53.341 --> 00:49:57.542]  ...medieval Europe and killed around 40% of the population.
[00:49:57.942 --> 00:50:01.963]  I mean, your statement about the military confiscating guns, they did do that with the police.
[00:50:02.644 --> 00:50:12.406]  At the first chance they got, there was a huge backlash against it, and now they've backed off of it, it looks like, for now, though there is still some selective gun confiscation, and it just is despicable.
[00:50:13.166 --> 00:50:18.568]  And as for ordering millions of injections of this...
[00:50:19.932 --> 00:50:32.554]  You know, for this bird flu, I mean, they're really hyping that as another created crisis, which I think the globalists may use for total martial law, and I believe New Orleans has been a perfect drill for them.
[00:50:33.703 --> 00:50:39.345]  Now, this thing was the mayor talking about, you know, people talking back in to New Orleans next week.
[00:50:39.365 --> 00:50:46.428]  He was talking about, you know, the military having, you know, M16s and... Oh, I heard him shoot his mouth off.
[00:50:46.468 --> 00:50:50.669]  If you think you're going to cause problems, I know, just more government's your god.
[00:50:50.729 --> 00:50:51.650]  I'm a big, tough guy.
[00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:52.210]  Stay there.
[00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.950]  I'll let you finish up.
[00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:54.911]  You're bringing up amazing points, Gary.
[00:50:54.931 --> 00:50:55.591]  And then I'm going to go to...
[00:50:56.075 --> 00:51:01.337]  I'm going to go to Steve Mason, who's going to give us a quick report on anti-Minutemen Ribson Austin.
[00:51:01.897 --> 00:51:06.218]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.398 --> 00:51:10.860]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:15.361]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:15.401 --> 00:51:16.742]  The New World Order.
[00:51:18.536 --> 00:51:22.759]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.819 --> 00:51:29.743]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.883 --> 00:51:31.965]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:32.265 --> 00:51:42.612]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.892 --> 00:51:46.614]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video,

[00:53:18.249 --> 00:53:18.850]  I think so.
[00:53:38.427 --> 00:53:38.927]  We're good to go.
[00:54:04.268 --> 00:54:17.351]  All right, Gary in Tennessee, finish up what you were saying, sir?
[00:54:17.371 --> 00:54:24.573]  All right, I was just kind of curious, you know, do you think there will be a continuing thing in Louisiana with the military occupied there?
[00:54:24.593 --> 00:54:26.754]  They were talking about a curfew from dusk to dawn and
[00:54:27.453 --> 00:54:28.234]  Oh, exactly.
[00:54:28.274 --> 00:54:36.018]  Now it's going to be a city modeled with the population in it, with the troops stomping around, ordering everybody about.
[00:54:36.879 --> 00:54:38.900]  And it's the same thing for the entire region.
[00:54:39.561 --> 00:54:45.024]  And a lot of these troops have been trained in Iraq in these very same type of operations.
[00:54:45.724 --> 00:54:56.091]  Is this like a step towards the streets being occupied, you know, soldiers walking and riding the streets and, you know, the things that we've been hearing about over the years?
[00:54:57.012 --> 00:54:59.893]  Yes, sir, it absolutely is, and I appreciate the call.
[00:54:59.953 --> 00:55:09.237]  But look, I'm not an expert on what's happened in the Gulf region, but I have read what the experts are saying, and I've read what locals are saying.
[00:55:10.797 --> 00:55:14.879]  And the disaster of the displaced population is huge and expensive.
[00:55:15.419 --> 00:55:18.540]  And there is massive damage, tens of thousands of destroyed homes.
[00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:23.654]  But to say it's going to cost $200 billion is an exaggeration.
[00:55:25.235 --> 00:55:27.778]  First they said the city would be uninhabitable forever.
[00:55:28.218 --> 00:55:29.259]  Then they said two years.
[00:55:29.279 --> 00:55:30.140]  Then they said a year.
[00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:32.963]  Now they said people can start moving back in next week.
[00:55:33.884 --> 00:55:37.107]  Already only 40% of the city is underwater.
[00:55:37.527 --> 00:55:39.890]  So the government really hyped all this up.
[00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:43.353]  And I'm not trying to say it's not a huge disaster.
[00:55:44.131 --> 00:55:51.577]  But by hyping it up and then accentuating the crises by not letting aid get in, they get to then get more funds and control.
[00:55:52.758 --> 00:55:57.962]  Let's go to Steve Mason, who does Texas Frontline, a local TV show here in Austin.
[00:55:58.682 --> 00:56:07.909]  And the anti-Minutemen, a lot of them are well-meaning idiots, but they're led by hardcore socialists.
[00:56:08.863 --> 00:56:17.768]  They're out calling anybody who is against open borders evil racist, I guess including all the Hispanics that are against it and 87% of Americans in major polls.
[00:56:19.448 --> 00:56:27.853]  But they had a rally yesterday, and it kind of turned into a peace rally instead, but there's going to be another one this weekend here in Austin.
[00:56:28.133 --> 00:56:29.173]  Steve, give us an update.
[00:56:29.754 --> 00:56:35.336]  I'm going to read this straight out of the Austin Chronicle from today on page 19.
[00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:45.306]  Texas's immigrant community will converge on the Capitol Saturday, September 17th for the Protest the Minute Men Rally for the Dream event.
[00:56:45.386 --> 00:57:00.036]  Representative Lloyd Doggett, City Councilmember Raul Alvarez, LULAC National President Hector Flores, Arizona State Representative Kirsten Sinema, join UT Longhorn LULAC Council and some other of these Hispanic groups.
[00:57:00.931 --> 00:57:01.332]  Yes.
[00:57:18.923 --> 00:57:22.605]  Yes, and you will notice Lloyd Doggett, our congressman, marching with these people.
[00:57:22.665 --> 00:57:24.726]  Well, I know you want me to go down there and bullhorn them.
[00:57:24.806 --> 00:57:27.187]  I just... No, no, I don't want you to bullhorn them.
[00:57:27.207 --> 00:57:28.607]  I just want somebody... Well, I think I might.
[00:57:28.787 --> 00:57:29.368]  I don't know.
[00:57:29.388 --> 00:57:33.209]  I need somebody to take photos of it, especially of Doggett.
[00:57:33.590 --> 00:57:37.711]  Doggett marched with these illegal aliens where they had the illegal alien immigrant ride or whatever.
[00:57:37.932 --> 00:57:39.352]  And this is going to be tomorrow?
[00:57:39.672 --> 00:57:41.433]  Yes, it's starting at 4 o'clock.
[00:57:41.573 --> 00:57:47.636]  It's also listed among all the events, the Mexican Independence Day events and yesterday's statesmen.
[00:57:48.183 --> 00:57:53.148]  Although they don't tell you what it's about, about what this particular event is about.
[00:57:53.688 --> 00:57:59.774]  Oh, by the way, UT does not allow, they canceled decades ago Texas Independence.
[00:57:59.814 --> 00:58:02.937]  It is considered evil and bad and horrible.
[00:58:03.237 --> 00:58:07.421]  Meanwhile, they sponsor Spanish Independence and say this is Mexico.
[00:58:07.762 --> 00:58:12.286]  Why would the big fat bankers and UT with $30 billion in their funds...
[00:58:13.687 --> 00:58:16.068]  Why would the evil whitey be promoting it?
[00:58:16.428 --> 00:58:29.753]  Because they hate America, it's a globalist plan to break this country up, and for all the supremacists, the Mexican supremacists, you're a bunch of idiots being led around by the nose, and that's why you're slaves in Mexico, and that's why you'll be slaves here.
[00:58:30.094 --> 00:58:31.774]  Why don't you join the Minutemen?
[00:58:32.094 --> 00:58:34.695]  Why don't you join George Washington against the crown?
[00:58:35.676 --> 00:58:38.457]  Stay there, Mason, unless you finish up on the other side.
[00:58:41.992 --> 00:58:42.232]  Or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:58.007 --> 00:58:58.648]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.308 --> 00:59:00.369]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:02.191]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.851 --> 00:59:03.652]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.412 --> 00:59:05.954]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.994 --> 00:59:09.937]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.157 --> 00:59:14.300]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:17.163]  All right, a load of fun as usual.
[00:59:17.183 --> 00:59:19.685]  We'll be taking your calls and covering masses of news.
[00:59:20.954 --> 00:59:27.578]  From the police state, the latest Katrina developments, to what's happening with the economy in the next two hours.
[00:59:28.278 --> 00:59:30.219]  No guests today, just your calls in the news.
[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:35.782]  And we're talking to Steve Mason, who produces the TV show Texas Frontline.
[00:59:36.483 --> 00:59:40.585]  And I can't really describe to you how nasty the Mecha La Raza groups are.
[00:59:40.645 --> 00:59:42.286]  Mecha means, you know, the takeover.
[00:59:42.346 --> 00:59:44.607]  It says, for our race, everything.
[00:59:44.667 --> 00:59:46.188]  For those outside the race, nothing.
[00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:50.281]  And then you've got La Raza that means the race.
[00:59:50.361 --> 00:59:56.503]  And again, you've got all the big banks funding this as a way to balkanize America and turn us all against each other.
[00:59:57.283 --> 01:00:02.124]  And the media all promotes Mexican independence day and says this is Mexico.
[01:00:02.144 --> 01:00:04.905]  I mean, mainstream media owned by old white guys.
[01:00:05.525 --> 01:00:08.286]  But then UT will not allow Texas independence day.
[01:00:08.306 --> 01:00:09.106]  It's considered evil.
[01:00:09.946 --> 01:00:10.846]  Folks, I'm not joking.
[01:00:10.886 --> 01:00:11.687]  I'm not teasing.
[01:00:11.707 --> 01:00:13.047]  This is not a joke.
[01:00:14.247 --> 01:00:16.148]  And, you know, I'm tempted...
[01:00:16.832 --> 01:00:17.693]  What time is it?
[01:00:17.733 --> 01:00:20.354]  I don't even know where my bullhorn is.
[01:00:20.414 --> 01:00:21.555]  I moved stuff around the garage.
[01:00:21.575 --> 01:00:22.615]  I was trying to find it the other day.
[01:00:23.516 --> 01:00:26.657]  And I need to load up the cameras and get some people together to go down there.
[01:00:27.678 --> 01:00:29.639]  I mean, I guess I really should go down there.
[01:00:29.659 --> 01:00:32.560]  I just get so sick of it, being around a bunch of ignorant people.
[01:00:33.401 --> 01:00:37.423]  But why don't you... Mason, what time is this tomorrow?
[01:00:38.764 --> 01:00:39.444]  Gather at 4 p.m.
[01:00:39.684 --> 01:00:43.026]  at Riverside and South Congress and march to the Capitol for the rally.
[01:00:43.382 --> 01:00:46.144]  You can find this on page 19 of the current Austin Chronicle.
[01:00:46.244 --> 01:00:49.646]  Remember the fun of shutting down Vicente Fox?
[01:00:50.087 --> 01:00:50.407]  Pardon me?
[01:00:50.527 --> 01:00:51.127]  Oh, yeah.
[01:00:51.308 --> 01:00:52.288]  Tell folks about that.
[01:00:53.849 --> 01:01:07.399]  Oh, well, when Vicente Fox decided to meet with his boyfriend, Rick Perry, at the Texas Governor's Mansion back in November 2003, so the two of them could discuss how to carve up the fat pork of the state of Texas...
[01:01:09.203 --> 01:01:17.830]  Alex, you announced it, and you brought out 50 people, and you embarrassed Vicente Fox on public TV.
[01:01:17.850 --> 01:01:19.511]  Well, we shut down his press conference.
[01:01:19.531 --> 01:01:20.311]  He couldn't even have it.
[01:01:20.692 --> 01:01:22.733]  Yeah, and that was on the news there.
[01:01:22.773 --> 01:01:28.417]  He was disconcerted and highly... You know, I can't even find the digital tapes of that that we shot.
[01:01:28.457 --> 01:01:30.018]  You've got the newscast of that.
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:37.764]  I gave you the half-inch tape on that, but... Does that half-inch tape have my report on as well?
[01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:39.571]  Yeah.
[01:01:40.151 --> 01:01:42.134]  Why don't we discuss this later?
[01:01:43.696 --> 01:01:44.577]  You know, when we've got time?
[01:01:44.837 --> 01:01:45.158]  No, no.
[01:01:45.278 --> 01:01:46.619]  People like to discuss it on air.
[01:01:46.639 --> 01:01:47.400]  Oh, okay.
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:47.841]  Okay.
[01:01:48.161 --> 01:01:49.303]  Let's discuss all the details.
[01:01:49.343 --> 01:01:50.324]  What time is it tomorrow?
[01:01:50.784 --> 01:01:52.006]  It starts at 4 o'clock.
[01:01:52.547 --> 01:01:53.768]  It's South Congress.
[01:01:53.908 --> 01:01:54.509]  I'm sorry.
[01:01:54.529 --> 01:01:56.732]  Riverside and South Congress to march to the Capitol.
[01:01:57.629 --> 01:02:02.711]  And you're going to be seeing, for the people in Austin, you're going to see your elected representative.
[01:02:03.111 --> 01:02:09.113]  You never see Lloyd Doggett marching for Texas Independence Day, but he marches arm-in-arm with illegal alien criminals.
[01:02:10.133 --> 01:02:13.234]  And he marches, and he's all for them, but he doesn't care about the people who put out words.
[01:02:13.314 --> 01:02:13.994]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:02:14.254 --> 01:02:14.815]  I'm going.
[01:02:14.975 --> 01:02:17.655]  I've got to get my posse and video cameras together.
[01:02:17.675 --> 01:02:20.977]  And last time we did this with about two hours' notice.
[01:02:21.017 --> 01:02:22.337]  We're doing this with a day's notice.
[01:02:23.658 --> 01:02:27.779]  I've got to think, you know, should we wait for them down at the Capitol?
[01:02:27.819 --> 01:02:31.520]  Because they obviously won't let us on the Capitol grounds, but we've sued them and won.
[01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:37.561]  They can't stop us from being right there where Congress runs into the Capitol in that little space.
[01:02:37.902 --> 01:02:40.442]  Should we wait for them and be bullhorning as they come?
[01:02:40.502 --> 01:02:44.523]  Or should I do what I've done with the 100 bureaucrat march known as the Million Moms?
[01:02:44.943 --> 01:02:47.044]  Should I walk at the head of them bullhorning them?
[01:02:49.495 --> 01:02:50.555]  I prefer the latter.
[01:02:50.875 --> 01:02:54.716]  And I also think that somebody needs to be filming them while they're on campus.
[01:02:54.736 --> 01:02:58.057]  Somebody needs to get that smirking face of Lloyd Doggett.
[01:02:58.077 --> 01:03:03.399]  He needs to know that we shall not tolerate our election.
[01:03:03.419 --> 01:03:08.580]  Well, Mason, you've been asking me to do it for days, and I've been in this allergy days.
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:13.382]  But no, I'm reporting for duty, as they say.
[01:03:14.362 --> 01:03:18.323]  And I want folks, let's just say this.
[01:03:19.295 --> 01:03:21.897]  Okay, it's Riverside and Congress at 4 o'clock.
[01:03:23.299 --> 01:03:32.326]  Let's just say that we're all going to meet at 3.30 in front of the Capitol, you know, down there in that space between Congress and the Capitol gates.
[01:03:33.828 --> 01:03:43.456]  Anybody who loves America, everybody's welcome, especially Hispanics that love America and have fought for this country and know this is part of a larger plan.
[01:03:44.136 --> 01:03:46.999]  Be there tomorrow, 4 o'clock.
[01:03:48.117 --> 01:03:49.698]  I guess there's no rest for the wicked.
[01:03:50.738 --> 01:03:53.039]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:57.801]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:58.042 --> 01:03:58.742]  Hello, my friends.
[01:03:58.842 --> 01:03:59.622]  Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.962 --> 01:04:04.645]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.985 --> 01:04:09.427]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:04:09.827 --> 01:04:14.009]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:14.229 --> 01:04:17.072]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:17.172 --> 01:04:21.836]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:22.036 --> 01:04:26.461]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight, piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.681 --> 01:04:33.908]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:34.168 --> 01:04:36.570]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[01:04:54.051 --> 01:04:57.332]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:04:57.373 --> 01:05:01.554]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:05:01.794 --> 01:05:04.596]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:05:04.776 --> 01:05:07.177]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:05:07.377 --> 01:05:16.000]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:05:16.201 --> 01:05:17.561]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:05:17.741 --> 01:05:21.903]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:05:22.223 --> 01:05:22.443]  I think?
[01:05:51.906 --> 01:05:52.526]  We're good to go.
[01:06:21.627 --> 01:06:22.848]  There are no side effects.
[01:06:22.988 --> 01:06:26.369]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:06:26.429 --> 01:06:27.549]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:06:27.830 --> 01:06:29.110]  Eliminate the cause.
[01:06:29.310 --> 01:06:36.153]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[01:06:41.836 --> 01:06:41.876]  866-885-6625.
[01:06:41.896 --> 01:06:42.857]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:06:54.452 --> 01:07:00.057]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:00.197 --> 01:07:03.820]  Look, folks, enough is enough.
[01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:08.984]  They're having Desi Seis, or whatever you call it, the independence from Spain.
[01:07:09.984 --> 01:07:12.546]  And all over the news, Texas used to be Mexico.
[01:07:13.267 --> 01:07:15.929]  And so they're celebrating it in downtown Austin.
[01:07:17.070 --> 01:07:18.811]  And this is really Mexico.
[01:07:18.831 --> 01:07:20.653]  And I'm sitting there watching this on the news.
[01:07:21.681 --> 01:07:25.042]  And then Metcha gets to go around saying, for our race, everything.
[01:07:25.082 --> 01:07:26.863]  For those outside the race, nothing.
[01:07:27.544 --> 01:07:29.344]  And La Raza means the race.
[01:07:30.305 --> 01:07:42.410]  And then the ACLU and others, the United Farm Workers and the Quakers, they have the nerve to claim that it's racist to want to control our borders.
[01:07:43.433 --> 01:07:51.735]  That it's racist to want to stop more illegals from coming in and driving the wages down to nothing and de-industrializing this country?
[01:07:51.775 --> 01:07:55.936]  I mean, there's six and a half billion people in the world.
[01:07:56.536 --> 01:07:58.196]  Are they all going to come here?
[01:07:58.656 --> 01:08:00.537]  I mean, this is a felony we're talking about.
[01:08:00.837 --> 01:08:06.398]  And we already had Vicente Fox show up and claim that this is Mexico.
[01:08:06.418 --> 01:08:08.118]  And I went to shut him down with a bullhorn.
[01:08:09.059 --> 01:08:10.359]  And I'm going to...
[01:08:11.744 --> 01:08:14.948]  I'm going to go out there tomorrow, and I'm not going to spend all day out there.
[01:08:15.769 --> 01:08:17.030]  I'm going to get out there about 3.30.
[01:08:18.532 --> 01:08:28.543]  And, I mean, understand, folks, the government-controlled groups are going into Desi Seis, which they promote all over the news, and they get thousands and thousands of people down there
[01:08:29.671 --> 01:08:33.273]  And then these groups show up and go, Now let's take over America!
[01:08:33.313 --> 01:08:33.833]  Yeah!
[01:08:33.893 --> 01:08:34.393]  Yeah!
[01:08:34.973 --> 01:08:42.696]  And, you know, got a congressman in the middle of it running this thing, and Bush is smirking with Mexican Marines behind him, pushing the La Reconquista.
[01:08:44.337 --> 01:08:48.939]  And so I want to see everybody out there that loves America, that thinks this is Texas.
[01:08:48.999 --> 01:08:53.901]  I mean, folks, the guy that wrote the Texas Constitution was Hispanic.
[01:08:53.921 --> 01:08:56.882]  I mean, about a third of the people in the Army were.
[01:08:56.902 --> 01:08:58.383]  It's such a lie.
[01:08:59.355 --> 01:09:01.756]  That Hispanics don't have part of Texas heritage.
[01:09:02.276 --> 01:09:03.337]  A big part of it, folks.
[01:09:03.477 --> 01:09:04.157]  Big part.
[01:09:04.718 --> 01:09:05.518]  Muli Grande.
[01:09:06.138 --> 01:09:11.681]  It is such a lie that movie The Alamo they put out.
[01:09:12.321 --> 01:09:13.502]  And that's why nobody wants to see it.
[01:09:13.542 --> 01:09:14.802]  Nobody wants to see a lie.
[01:09:15.102 --> 01:09:23.586]  Nobody wants to see that bull trying to devalue 186 men dying against thousands and thousands and thousands.
[01:09:24.527 --> 01:09:25.287]  And I'm sick of it.
[01:09:26.391 --> 01:09:27.191]  I don't know what I am.
[01:09:27.211 --> 01:09:28.952]  Am I a 7th and 8th generation Texas?
[01:09:28.992 --> 01:09:29.452]  I know.
[01:09:29.692 --> 01:09:31.233]  We've got Spanish land grants, folks.
[01:09:31.553 --> 01:09:31.233]  1829.
[01:09:31.733 --> 01:09:33.494]  This is my state.
[01:09:33.894 --> 01:09:35.615]  It belongs to anybody that loves Texas.
[01:09:35.655 --> 01:09:36.675]  I don't care where you're from.
[01:09:37.015 --> 01:09:40.977]  But don't go around shooting your mouth off about how this belongs to Mexico.
[01:09:41.317 --> 01:09:45.919]  A corrupt, criminal, narco-terrorist state controlled by Washington.
[01:09:46.359 --> 01:09:47.579]  I am not putting up with it.
[01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:54.462]  And I'm going to be working on the film, the new film I'm making this weekend, and
[01:09:55.379 --> 01:09:56.860]  I've got to spend some time with the family.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:02.864]  I was planning to go for a hike or something in the woods, but I guess that can't happen.
[01:10:02.904 --> 01:10:03.584]  That's all right.
[01:10:05.005 --> 01:10:16.532]  Believe me, I'll take no pleasure in being around a bunch of people all hyped up tribally, all manipulated by Madison Avenue advertisement techniques.
[01:10:18.474 --> 01:10:19.014]  But you know what?
[01:10:19.134 --> 01:10:23.377]  I have found that even illegal aliens...
[01:10:24.588 --> 01:10:25.829]  Know the truth when they see it.
[01:10:26.489 --> 01:10:30.452]  And they're all kind of half-heartedly being manipulated by a few controllers.
[01:10:31.272 --> 01:10:34.374]  And I got a sneaking suspicion we'll deprogram a bunch of them.
[01:10:36.476 --> 01:10:39.298]  We'll never deprogram the ACLU trash.
[01:10:40.278 --> 01:10:43.660]  We'll never deprogram the Quaker people.
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:49.644]  We'll never deprogram the Hispanic Ku Klux Klan organizations like Meche and La Raza.
[01:10:50.325 --> 01:10:52.426]  And I'm just going to be there reading quotes of these people.
[01:10:53.186 --> 01:10:57.289]  I'm going to just be there saying, Matt just said this in this periodical.
[01:10:58.670 --> 01:11:01.572]  White people need to be killed and driven out of the United States.
[01:11:03.373 --> 01:11:09.678]  Maybe I should blow up video stills of them with images of white people's heads cut off as they talk about how they want to murder us.
[01:11:09.698 --> 01:11:18.864]  I mean, you know, imagine if the Klan was dancing around with signs saying, we're going to kill all the black people in images of blacks' heads cut off.
[01:11:18.904 --> 01:11:19.985]  I mean, that's disgusting.
[01:11:21.201 --> 01:11:22.101]  And I'm sick of it.
[01:11:22.161 --> 01:11:23.501]  No, they're building an army.
[01:11:24.722 --> 01:11:25.222]  An army.
[01:11:26.762 --> 01:11:30.463]  And most Hispanics don't want to be part of it, but they say, hey, you don't want to be with them, do you?
[01:11:31.043 --> 01:11:36.544]  And then they see Americans, whether they're black or white, getting mad, and they say, okay, I better join it.
[01:11:37.844 --> 01:11:39.544]  I better just join the La Rican Quista.
[01:11:39.564 --> 01:11:41.485]  And then it's some kind of weird pride thing.
[01:11:41.925 --> 01:11:45.145]  You know, it's like Democrats that worship Clinton.
[01:11:45.185 --> 01:11:45.986]  It's a pride thing.
[01:11:46.886 --> 01:11:47.386]  It's like...
[01:11:50.166 --> 01:11:51.507]  Republicans that worship Bush.
[01:11:51.527 --> 01:11:52.447]  You're being conned.
[01:11:52.687 --> 01:11:53.668]  You're being manipulated.
[01:11:53.828 --> 01:11:56.049]  Well, the same thing goes for the Lorican Kistas.
[01:11:57.749 --> 01:12:00.891]  I want to see you tomorrow.
[01:12:00.911 --> 01:12:00.891]  3.30.
[01:12:02.531 --> 01:12:03.452]  To form up.
[01:12:06.153 --> 01:12:07.013]  To form up.
[01:12:08.234 --> 01:12:12.796]  It's right there on the, I guess what you'd call the south side of the Capitol.
[01:12:13.316 --> 01:12:16.197]  They don't let you on the Capitol grounds without a permit for a demonstration.
[01:12:16.437 --> 01:12:17.678]  There's the big iron gates.
[01:12:18.917 --> 01:12:20.998]  And right down in front of it is the road.
[01:12:21.479 --> 01:12:25.361]  It's about 20 feet of pavement by the road.
[01:12:25.441 --> 01:12:27.923]  And the state police are real nice.
[01:12:27.963 --> 01:12:29.744]  They're fans of the show.
[01:12:29.764 --> 01:12:31.825]  I don't want to get them in trouble, but they're big, big fans.
[01:12:32.766 --> 01:12:33.787]  I have to fight them off.
[01:12:33.807 --> 01:12:35.468]  They'll have to take me inside and give me coffee.
[01:12:37.709 --> 01:12:38.790]  So don't worry about them.
[01:12:40.644 --> 01:12:42.666]  And it's going to be real nice.
[01:12:43.067 --> 01:12:47.611]  And, you know, I just say we stay right there because the APD's been known to provocateur.
[01:12:48.012 --> 01:12:52.376]  They've gotten a lot of cash, a lot of rewards from Fox for Lurican Kistas.
[01:12:53.057 --> 01:12:58.983]  And I think it'll be better to not dance around engaging the Lurican Kista horde.
[01:12:59.924 --> 01:13:01.626]  It'll just be better to stay down there.
[01:13:03.136 --> 01:13:05.397]  On the state police territory jurisdiction.
[01:13:06.038 --> 01:13:14.145]  And as they come sneaking and snapping down the road, we will be there megaphoning them and getting the truth out.
[01:13:15.306 --> 01:13:18.528]  And I guess I've got to go home and I'll write a little press release up about this.
[01:13:19.849 --> 01:13:22.131]  And no rest in fighting the wicked, I tell you.
[01:13:23.112 --> 01:13:26.675]  And we'll get that out and just rally!
[01:13:27.536 --> 01:13:28.697]  Rally to me, folks!
[01:13:28.897 --> 01:13:30.258]  Come down tomorrow!
[01:13:30.936 --> 01:13:34.398]  You know, the old term rally was the term when you were surrounded by enemy forces.
[01:13:34.418 --> 01:13:36.820]  It's a Roman term for forming a square.
[01:13:37.481 --> 01:13:39.422]  So, rally!
[01:13:40.102 --> 01:13:47.087]  And then we're going to wheel, and we're going to face as a wedge the oncoming torrent of slime.
[01:13:48.568 --> 01:13:49.869]  Alright, as we've always done.
[01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:51.770]  I'm excited!
[01:13:52.331 --> 01:13:52.931]  Yes!
[01:13:54.592 --> 01:13:56.734]  Rally to me tomorrow!
[01:13:57.887 --> 01:13:59.588]  For Texas and America!
[01:14:00.128 --> 01:14:02.449]  Against the enemies of America!
[01:14:04.751 --> 01:14:05.911]  Now there's the call.
[01:14:06.391 --> 01:14:07.832]  Will the call be answered?
[01:14:07.932 --> 01:14:09.293]  I know it will.
[01:14:09.313 --> 01:14:09.293]  3.30.
[01:14:09.973 --> 01:14:11.254]  Be there.
[01:14:13.575 --> 01:14:16.617]  You get to face down.
[01:14:16.897 --> 01:14:19.238]  Lurican Kistas, head on.
[01:14:20.619 --> 01:14:21.619]  Head on.
[01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:24.621]  I want to see you there.
[01:14:24.641 --> 01:14:26.982]  I've been shooting your mouths off a lot of you.
[01:14:27.779 --> 01:14:32.161]  Out there about what you're going to do against the New World Order, you cannot find a better place to do something.
[01:14:33.802 --> 01:14:40.605]  All right, I want to see you there tomorrow, especially all my good Hispanic friends that love this country and know this is part of a master plan.
[01:14:40.905 --> 01:14:50.389]  It takes real courage for them, and they've got the courage, let me tell you, to sit there in this manipulated, artificially created system to get us all against each other.
[01:14:50.989 --> 01:14:53.210]  And let me tell you, if any scum shows up,
[01:14:54.745 --> 01:14:56.327]  And we've had a few provocateurs show up.
[01:14:56.367 --> 01:15:03.834]  We've traced them back to being cops before, and they'll try to put out... Usually they need a week's notice to do this.
[01:15:04.115 --> 01:15:12.043]  They probably won't be there, and they'll try to be there for the news cameras and hand out some stuff that will be just as racist as a little reconquista.
[01:15:12.363 --> 01:15:14.225]  We don't put up with that, and you'll get bullhorned, too.
[01:15:14.864 --> 01:15:24.547]  And you'll get followed to your police car, or we'll get your plates, we'll pay a private investigator to run that information, and we'll find out that you work for the cops, and we'll put you on the web.
[01:15:25.047 --> 01:15:27.608]  So don't show up, or I'm going to blow your cover!
[01:15:27.788 --> 01:15:30.989]  And every time I threaten this, because I've done it before, they don't show up.
[01:15:31.429 --> 01:15:33.809]  I will blow your cover if you show up!
[01:15:34.089 --> 01:15:35.570]  Do you understand me, punks?
[01:15:36.315 --> 01:15:37.736]  I will blow your cover!
[01:15:38.156 --> 01:15:38.696]  Period!
[01:15:39.177 --> 01:15:41.558]  And your three grand a month is going to be gone forever.
[01:15:41.578 --> 01:15:44.620]  You're going to be on the web, and millions of people are going to see you.
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:45.380]  You got it?
[01:15:45.741 --> 01:15:48.862]  Don't show up, provocateurs, or I'm going to ace you.
[01:15:49.923 --> 01:15:51.504]  All right, let's go ahead and take calls.
[01:15:51.544 --> 01:15:52.985]  I'm sorry, I'm feeling good now.
[01:15:59.268 --> 01:16:01.890]  All right, let's go ahead and take a call.
[01:16:03.416 --> 01:16:05.297]  Carton, Florida, welcome and thanks for holding.
[01:16:05.717 --> 01:16:06.997]  Hey Alex, it's my pleasure.
[01:16:07.017 --> 01:16:07.898]  How are you doing today?
[01:16:08.038 --> 01:16:08.458]  Good, buddy.
[01:16:09.078 --> 01:16:20.222]  Well, the first thing, and this wasn't even what I was talking about, but listening about it got me thinking about something I've seen on the History Channel a lot this week concerning Texas and the Mexicans trying to come up and claim it again.
[01:16:20.762 --> 01:16:22.683]  You know, Florida was given to the U.S.
[01:16:22.723 --> 01:16:25.664]  to try to appease us before Mexico got their independence.
[01:16:26.384 --> 01:16:32.166]  And over here in the northeastern part of Florida, we've had a, I'd hate to say it, but a
[01:16:32.864 --> 01:16:36.186]  Huge increase of Hispanic-speaking only people.
[01:16:36.966 --> 01:16:44.650]  Sir, it is $30 million at least, and now they're running around saying it's their country, and they want more, and Washington is financing it.
[01:16:44.670 --> 01:16:46.171]  I agree with you.
[01:16:46.191 --> 01:16:49.653]  I guess we're going to have to start up here next, like you're doing out there in Texas.
[01:16:50.193 --> 01:16:54.196]  God love Texas, because I spent eight years stationed there with the Coast Guard in Houston-based.
[01:16:55.076 --> 01:16:57.717]  I love that state with a passion.
[01:16:57.757 --> 01:16:59.638]  Well, we really appreciate the Coast Guard.
[01:16:59.658 --> 01:17:00.719]  They really do a lot of good service.
[01:17:00.739 --> 01:17:02.400]  What do you think of just everything that's happening?
[01:17:03.272 --> 01:17:06.674]  Oh, Lord, I'm afraid I'd get you censored if I started doing that.
[01:17:07.174 --> 01:17:15.179]  But let me comment on the two things I called you about, which you actually made my wife have to say I was right after 22 years of marriage.
[01:17:15.959 --> 01:17:28.046]  Wednesday night, we were sitting there watching the news on CNN, and this time a black guy that was broadcasting for them had a sort of thick European accent, and he's talking about the helicopters rescuing people.
[01:17:28.925 --> 01:17:36.930]  Well, they pan over there, and all of a sudden, my wife's beating me on the side of the head, talking about, look, baby, look, baby, that guy you listened to, Alex Jones, was right about the black helicopters.
[01:17:37.691 --> 01:17:38.231]  I'm like, what?
[01:17:38.371 --> 01:17:39.132]  I look over there.
[01:17:39.472 --> 01:17:47.918]  Lo and behold, there's a nice Kiowa sitting there, flat black, no identification marks, big Doppler radar dome above it.
[01:17:48.078 --> 01:17:48.298]  I know.
[01:17:48.338 --> 01:17:51.080]  I've been seeing those Delta Force Command copters in there.
[01:17:51.901 --> 01:17:53.782]  You know, that's ridiculous therapy.
[01:17:54.184 --> 01:17:58.885]  And then my other comment was about this elderly lady that got arrested for the sandwiches.
[01:17:59.545 --> 01:17:59.845]  Yes.
[01:18:00.085 --> 01:18:09.948]  Well, CNN showed they had a guy that was there downtown, and he confronted this lady, a black lady that had about seven or eight bags full of tennis shoes.
[01:18:10.588 --> 01:18:15.209]  You know, Nike, Converse, New Balance, different ones like that.
[01:18:15.649 --> 01:18:17.550]  And he asked her, he says, didn't you know that's illegal?
[01:18:17.950 --> 01:18:19.490]  This is like the day after the storm.
[01:18:20.194 --> 01:18:23.975]  And she goes, well, we've got to walk in this water and, you know, I won't choose to wear.
[01:18:23.995 --> 01:18:26.496]  Well, I hadn't heard her about being in jail.
[01:18:27.096 --> 01:18:33.838]  If they'll come out here, or better yet, if they'll tell me where to show up, I'll do the lady's time to sit in jail for stealing the sandwiches.
[01:18:34.498 --> 01:18:35.799]  I know, it's just crazy.
[01:18:35.859 --> 01:18:39.640]  Oh, we're going to put you in jail for, what is she facing, like 20 years or something?
[01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:43.221]  For sandwiches, but this other lady, exactly.
[01:18:43.261 --> 01:18:46.022]  We have cops on video with their badge numbers stealing.
[01:18:47.182 --> 01:18:48.122]  Thanks for the call, sir.
[01:18:48.162 --> 01:18:49.783]  We'll be right back with more calls, more news.
[01:18:54.002 --> 01:19:00.225]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:19:00.686 --> 01:19:08.450]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:16.674]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:19:16.954 --> 01:19:21.717]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:19:22.037 --> 01:19:26.760]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:19:27.261 --> 01:19:31.123]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:19:31.623 --> 01:19:32.644]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:19:32.704 --> 01:19:36.787]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:19:37.207 --> 01:19:41.610]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:44.632]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:19:45.092 --> 01:19:47.673]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:48.993 --> 01:19:50.314]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:50.434 --> 01:19:57.016]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:19:57.376 --> 01:20:06.218]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:20:06.519 --> 01:20:11.180]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:18.383]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:20:18.783 --> 01:20:30.568]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:20:31.028 --> 01:20:35.490]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:20:35.670 --> 01:20:38.112]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:20:38.152 --> 01:20:39.952]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:20:39.992 --> 01:20:41.193]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:20:41.253 --> 01:20:42.734]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:20:42.754 --> 01:20:43.794]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:20:53.819 --> 01:20:56.361]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:56.862 --> 01:21:01.325]  Did you know there's a secret group that wants the government to spend itself in the bankruptcy?
[01:21:01.865 --> 01:21:08.110]  Did you know that current President Bush has the largest percentage of increase in spending than any Democrat has ever had?
[01:21:09.111 --> 01:21:11.974]  38% higher than Bill Clinton's highest budget.
[01:21:12.375 --> 01:21:21.666]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening and more about Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:21:35.697 --> 01:21:35.937]  Music
[01:21:53.951 --> 01:21:57.092]  We understand that decisions related to health can be overwhelming.
[01:21:57.332 --> 01:22:04.134]  That is why at ResearchedHerbs.com we take pride in offering you herbs whose safety and effectiveness have been proven time and time again.
[01:22:04.574 --> 01:22:17.938]  For example, did you know that Live52, the top-selling natural herbal supplement for liver diseases since 1930, is backed by over 300 research studies and clinical trials and prescribed by more than 200,000 health professionals worldwide?
[01:22:18.258 --> 01:22:21.979]  In fact, the effectiveness of all the herbs featured on ResearchedHerbs.com
[01:22:22.279 --> 01:22:23.400]  We're good to go.
[01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:23.680]  I think?
[01:22:57.162 --> 01:23:00.765]  All right, let's just blast through your calls, because there is some news I want to get to.
[01:23:01.085 --> 01:23:03.587]  We're coming up on the halfway point of this Friday edition.
[01:23:05.749 --> 01:23:08.171]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jason in Wisconsin.
[01:23:08.231 --> 01:23:09.011]  Go ahead, Jason.
[01:23:09.512 --> 01:23:10.312]  Hey, Alex.
[01:23:10.973 --> 01:23:22.422]  The other night, my wife was watching, I believe, MSNBC, and on there, there was, going across the bottom of the screen, she said, it said something about Cheney visits the Katrina experiment.
[01:23:23.343 --> 01:23:26.185]  I was wondering if anybody else seen that, or just
[01:23:26.681 --> 01:23:28.102]  I can't find nothing about that.
[01:23:28.122 --> 01:23:29.662]  That was the only time it was shown.
[01:23:29.682 --> 01:23:39.345]  Just wondering if anybody... Well, I've heard them comment many times that they're learning from this and that this is a simulation and that this is a war game.
[01:23:39.665 --> 01:23:42.106]  Look, they call Afghanistan a laboratory.
[01:23:42.506 --> 01:23:43.987]  They call Iraq a laboratory.
[01:23:44.447 --> 01:23:46.188]  Yeah, I've heard you say that a bunch of times.
[01:23:49.249 --> 01:23:52.590]  I thought it was just kind of interesting that it was actually shown on TV.
[01:23:53.413 --> 01:23:54.934]  That they actually came out and said that.
[01:23:54.974 --> 01:23:58.017]  Well, they're doing all sorts of psychological testing on us right now.
[01:23:59.798 --> 01:24:07.204]  And then the other thing I'd like to say is thank you for your coverage on the mercury in the vaccines and everything.
[01:24:07.765 --> 01:24:11.928]  That one hits really close to home here, so I'd like to thank you for that.
[01:24:12.609 --> 01:24:16.091]  Well, no, sir, I mean, look, I'm just trying to do a public service announcement.
[01:24:16.192 --> 01:24:16.572]  I mean...
[01:24:17.245 --> 01:24:22.107]  We've got to expose that the government knowingly puts this in there and knowingly brain damages children.
[01:24:22.387 --> 01:24:23.427]  That's not our opinion.
[01:24:23.807 --> 01:24:33.811]  The CDC documents, the minutes from their corporate meetings in 2000 at the board of directors, the highest levels of the government agency, said we know this has brain damaged millions.
[01:24:33.851 --> 01:24:35.031]  We've got to cover this up.
[01:24:35.671 --> 01:24:36.792]  And they haven't taken it out.
[01:24:36.832 --> 01:24:37.592]  They've increased it.
[01:24:37.992 --> 01:24:43.514]  I believe that my son's pediatrician believes that that's why he is the way he is.
[01:24:43.994 --> 01:24:45.955]  And he came out and straight out and said that's what it is.
[01:24:47.857 --> 01:24:51.079]  Was your son developing until he got a build-up of the injections?
[01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:51.640]  Yes.
[01:24:53.622 --> 01:24:55.143]  How old was he, 18 months?
[01:24:57.085 --> 01:24:58.266]  I'd say probably about two.
[01:24:58.386 --> 01:25:01.969]  It was probably around his last set of shots, I believe.
[01:25:02.009 --> 01:25:03.891]  Yeah, that's when it builds up to critical mass.
[01:25:04.892 --> 01:25:13.199]  And so, let me guess, your son had developed nicely, was doing fine, and then he kind of changed quite a bit after that last round?
[01:25:13.519 --> 01:25:13.900]  Yeah, he...
[01:25:15.871 --> 01:25:17.712]  He started talking normally.
[01:25:17.732 --> 01:25:22.153]  A few words here and there, and then all of a sudden it just stopped.
[01:25:22.493 --> 01:25:28.715]  My grandmother came to visit, and my cousin, who was about the same age as my son, had the same problem.
[01:25:28.755 --> 01:25:30.675]  She said, you've got to get him to the doctor.
[01:25:30.695 --> 01:25:32.816]  You've got to get him looked at.
[01:25:33.856 --> 01:25:35.156]  That's when we started.
[01:25:35.176 --> 01:25:37.897]  To give you an idea, folks, they've gone from 1 in 25,000 having it to 1 in 168.
[01:25:38.077 --> 01:25:40.078]  Again, most children, it just brain damages them a little bit.
[01:25:45.857 --> 01:25:48.558]  Because we want to reduce our IQ and our cognitive levels.
[01:25:48.998 --> 01:25:50.099]  Literally, this is official.
[01:25:50.879 --> 01:25:54.440]  But with some children, and just God bless you, how old is your son?
[01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:55.621]  He'll be seven.
[01:25:56.901 --> 01:25:57.902]  Has he gotten better?
[01:25:59.762 --> 01:26:03.564]  We've been going for four years now, just trying to get him diagnosed.
[01:26:04.824 --> 01:26:08.205]  And so we could get help with different therapies and stuff.
[01:26:08.505 --> 01:26:09.446]  Yeah, you don't want to...
[01:26:10.856 --> 01:26:12.156]  Well, I'm not going to give you medical advice.
[01:26:12.176 --> 01:26:12.757]  Do what you want.
[01:26:13.497 --> 01:26:15.998]  I just... Don't let them put him on medication.
[01:26:16.018 --> 01:26:18.259]  No, I refuse any of that.
[01:26:18.799 --> 01:26:24.161]  I mean, we've got problems with him sleeping at night, and they want us to put him on something for sleeping, and I won't listen to that.
[01:26:24.281 --> 01:26:25.581]  They're murdering bastards.
[01:26:25.621 --> 01:26:26.401]  Thanks for the call.
[01:26:27.022 --> 01:26:27.622]  God bless you.
[01:26:27.642 --> 01:26:29.182]  That just tears my guts out.
[01:26:29.222 --> 01:26:30.103]  Tears my heart out.
[01:26:31.303 --> 01:26:31.803]  Oh, man.
[01:26:31.823 --> 01:26:39.686]  I mean, we've got Senator Biden talking to Roberts during confirmation about ruling on forcible chips in the population.
[01:26:40.515 --> 01:26:43.417]  We got the Mexican Attorney General making his employees take it.
[01:26:44.758 --> 01:26:49.401]  We got the government passing forced psychological testing, forced psychological drugging for all the children.
[01:26:50.181 --> 01:26:54.023]  We got the state of Texas trying to pass laws to put chips in all the cars to taxes.
[01:26:54.203 --> 01:26:55.024]  Barely beat that.
[01:26:56.305 --> 01:26:59.006]  We got troops running around engaging in gun confiscation.
[01:26:59.046 --> 01:27:02.268]  We got cancer viruses and mercury in the vaccines.
[01:27:02.769 --> 01:27:06.131]  New cancer viruses being reported on every week by the big medical journals.
[01:27:06.770 --> 01:27:08.971]  We've got cancer doubling every ten years.
[01:27:09.011 --> 01:27:14.715]  We've got totally open borders, signing deals for Mexican troops to, quote, deal with American terrorists.
[01:27:15.315 --> 01:27:18.957]  We've got just bonkers, total insanity, world government.
[01:27:20.558 --> 01:27:22.379]  Just, I'm living in an insane asylum.
[01:27:22.719 --> 01:27:26.281]  I mean, it's just... And I have to go out tomorrow, and you do too.
[01:27:26.321 --> 01:27:27.402]  You better be there, folks.
[01:27:27.702 --> 01:27:28.562]  Believe me, I'm tired.
[01:27:28.602 --> 01:27:29.303]  I don't want to do this.
[01:27:30.083 --> 01:27:31.444]  You better be out there tomorrow.
[01:27:32.105 --> 01:27:33.205]  When the Lurican keeps this.
[01:27:33.245 --> 01:27:35.806]  I mean, these people say America belongs to them.
[01:27:36.186 --> 01:27:37.747]  They say Texas doesn't exist.
[01:27:38.247 --> 01:27:39.487]  They say this is theirs.
[01:27:40.107 --> 01:27:42.128]  Well, then if it's so good, go back to Mexico.
[01:27:43.668 --> 01:27:50.670]  And they're going to have Lloyd Doggett and a bunch of white people leading them who just want to use them as a political tool to break down this country.
[01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:52.611]  I'm not putting up with it.
[01:27:54.711 --> 01:27:56.872]  So, we got a job to do.
[01:27:56.932 --> 01:27:57.592]  Let's do it.
[01:27:59.533 --> 01:28:00.393]  And I just get angry.
[01:28:00.453 --> 01:28:00.753]  I just...
[01:28:01.678 --> 01:28:07.241]  Look, folks, if you're black, if you're white, if you're Hispanic, I care about you the same, and you know that in your gut.
[01:28:07.961 --> 01:28:09.162]  Listen, I'm telling you straight.
[01:28:10.282 --> 01:28:17.626]  Why were you taught from being a child by a government that you know enslaves you that America's bad and that you're going to take over?
[01:28:18.086 --> 01:28:19.967]  Did you know our government funded that?
[01:28:20.467 --> 01:28:22.068]  Now, do you like being conned?
[01:28:22.548 --> 01:28:23.909]  I'm asking you a question!
[01:28:26.070 --> 01:28:27.311]  Now, join us!
[01:28:29.182 --> 01:28:40.247]  If you love your family, if you love dignity, if you love freedom, throw in with the Texans, like your forefathers did against Santa Ana the Dictator, who the Mexicans later overthrew.
[01:28:40.727 --> 01:28:42.008]  Throw in with us!
[01:28:42.188 --> 01:28:42.848]  Join us!
[01:28:44.249 --> 01:28:45.169]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.630 --> 01:28:47.230]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.151 --> 01:28:50.832]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.832 --> 01:28:56.393]  Americans are under a covert medical attack daily.
[01:28:56.453 --> 01:29:00.015]  These chemicals are affecting our brains and may well destroy our society.
[01:29:00.135 --> 01:29:00.515]  Shocking?
[01:29:00.615 --> 01:29:01.055]  Of course!
[01:29:01.355 --> 01:29:03.416]  But what you don't know can indeed kill you.
[01:29:03.556 --> 01:29:06.437]  Big business buries the truth and silences the majority.
[01:29:06.657 --> 01:29:08.018]  Forewarned is forearmed.
[01:29:08.178 --> 01:29:12.440]  Order your copy of the book Secret Assassins of Food by Dr. Ott Ph.D.

[01:29:53.852 --> 01:30:02.095]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:02.355 --> 01:30:06.716]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:07.016 --> 01:30:15.919]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:30:16.119 --> 01:30:19.760]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:25.085]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:25.366 --> 01:30:32.073]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:30:32.583 --> 01:30:33.244]  What about you?
[01:30:33.884 --> 01:30:39.229]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:30:53.519 --> 01:30:55.501]  Hey, Jack Blood here from Deadline Live.
[01:30:55.561 --> 01:30:58.444]  You know, it seems people will steal anything and everything you have.
[01:30:58.624 --> 01:31:04.009]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there was someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[01:31:04.250 --> 01:31:05.791]  And what about those government agencies?
[01:31:05.831 --> 01:31:08.073]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[01:31:08.253 --> 01:31:11.737]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[01:31:12.157 --> 01:31:12.818]  We're good to go.
[01:31:34.841 --> 01:31:38.643]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:31:38.663 --> 01:31:40.604]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:11.697 --> 01:32:19.423]  You know, I'm the type of person that might take five Tylenols a year, maybe.
[01:32:21.024 --> 01:32:23.906]  And those five Tylenols will be at one time, you know, when I've got a cold.
[01:32:24.487 --> 01:32:26.308]  I might get a cold every two years or something.
[01:32:26.348 --> 01:32:30.692]  But Austin is the capital of allergies in the United States.
[01:32:30.712 --> 01:32:32.433]  If you look at the literature, it is the worst.
[01:32:32.533 --> 01:32:36.856]  Because four different types of...
[01:32:38.507 --> 01:32:45.655]  I guess flora and fauna, different regions, come together here in Texas.
[01:32:48.858 --> 01:32:50.120]  Right here in central Texas.
[01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:53.143]  And so we are the capital of allergies.
[01:32:53.223 --> 01:32:59.450]  We have the most bizarre forms of trees and weeds and
[01:33:00.863 --> 01:33:05.985]  And, you know, I grew up in Dallas and never had allergies, and I would laugh at friends who had it.
[01:33:06.005 --> 01:33:07.365]  Oh, I can't come out today.
[01:33:07.385 --> 01:33:17.348]  You know, I can't go, you know, ride dirt bikes or whatever because my allergies are so bad.
[01:33:17.388 --> 01:33:22.690]  And they'd be, you know, nose running, eyes dripping, and I'd, ah, you're a wimp, you know.
[01:33:22.970 --> 01:33:25.211]  Because back then I'd get sick about every three years.
[01:33:26.291 --> 01:33:28.552]  And, I mean, I was never sick.
[01:33:29.201 --> 01:33:37.784]  And then after living in Austin about ten years, about five, six years ago, I started getting allergies.
[01:33:38.105 --> 01:33:40.265]  And, man, they are painful.
[01:33:40.766 --> 01:33:45.267]  You know, the pressure in your sinuses, the headaches, all of it, and they get worse and worse.
[01:33:45.968 --> 01:33:48.168]  And people are always, go to the doctor, go to the doctor.
[01:33:48.208 --> 01:33:52.310]  And so, go to the doctor, give me some prescription pills, don't work.
[01:33:53.050 --> 01:33:57.132]  Well, I just was walking through the store yesterday, and I said, I'll buy some of that Zycam.
[01:33:58.928 --> 01:34:00.229]  By the way, they're not a sponsor, folks.
[01:34:00.269 --> 01:34:03.813]  If something works, and it may not work for you, I'm going to plug it.
[01:34:04.334 --> 01:34:08.598]  I'm sure it's probably not good for you or something, but frankly, I don't care if it gives me relief.
[01:34:10.580 --> 01:34:12.282]  It's given me like 90% relief.
[01:34:13.043 --> 01:34:15.005]  I was almost not doing shows.
[01:34:15.966 --> 01:34:19.009]  One of these things triggered a migraine headache last week I talked about on air.
[01:34:19.902 --> 01:34:23.464]  But Zycam, I got the allergy relief seasonal non-drowsy.
[01:34:23.984 --> 01:34:25.385]  Oh yeah, you'll be non-drowsy.
[01:34:25.405 --> 01:34:27.826]  That's the only side effect so far.
[01:34:27.946 --> 01:34:30.667]  And it just knocked it out, folks.
[01:34:31.047 --> 01:34:31.708]  Knocked it out.
[01:34:32.388 --> 01:34:34.489]  So there is a plug for Zycam.
[01:34:35.730 --> 01:34:39.291]  I mean, I've tried Sudafed and other over-the-counter stuff.
[01:34:39.311 --> 01:34:44.134]  It did absolutely nothing but made me be wide awake in pain.
[01:34:44.974 --> 01:34:47.195]  But this Zycam is...
[01:34:50.174 --> 01:34:50.995]  Really effective.
[01:34:52.055 --> 01:34:53.156]  Lord knows what's in it.
[01:34:55.298 --> 01:34:57.799]  I can't even pronounce the four ingredients this has got.
[01:34:59.140 --> 01:35:02.703]  One of the things it has is good old-fashioned sulfur.
[01:35:03.063 --> 01:35:04.104]  I wonder what that does.
[01:35:04.844 --> 01:35:19.475]  But luffa, opera catelia, galafina glosca, histaminum hydrochloricium.
[01:35:19.615 --> 01:35:19.695]  Ha!
[01:35:21.033 --> 01:35:27.098]  Anyways, I'm sure it's horrible or something, but I'm sorry.
[01:35:27.138 --> 01:35:28.739]  I'm just a little bit happy not to be in pain.
[01:35:30.801 --> 01:35:39.188]  At the same time, and see, I'm ready now to charge out and face the Lurican Kistas tomorrow at 3.30, peaceably and happily.
[01:35:39.768 --> 01:35:43.151]  I'm going to be there bullhorning them, saying, Santa Ana was a tyrant.
[01:35:43.531 --> 01:35:47.574]  You overthrew him shortly after you overthrew Spain.
[01:35:47.594 --> 01:35:49.476]  We're going to be pointing that out.
[01:35:50.586 --> 01:35:52.869]  Why don't you celebrate Texas independence?
[01:35:53.149 --> 01:35:56.354]  A third of the people that fought in the war for independence were Hispanic.
[01:35:57.515 --> 01:36:01.180]  The individual that wrote the Constitution was Hispanic.
[01:36:01.721 --> 01:36:03.042]  What is your problem?
[01:36:04.044 --> 01:36:06.387]  The number two person in the government was Hispanic.
[01:36:06.974 --> 01:36:08.235]  What is wrong with you?
[01:36:08.715 --> 01:36:15.738]  Did you know that Mecha, that their maxim is for the race, everything outside the race, nothing.
[01:36:16.238 --> 01:36:18.039]  La Raza means the race.
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:19.920]  What's wrong with you?
[01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:20.981]  Wake up!
[01:36:21.581 --> 01:36:24.402]  You're just the vanguard of illegals from the third world.
[01:36:24.662 --> 01:36:26.443]  There's billions that want to come here.
[01:36:26.763 --> 01:36:28.544]  The globalists want to drive down wages.
[01:36:28.644 --> 01:36:32.226]  And that's the truth, and that's a message the media can't deal with.
[01:36:33.726 --> 01:36:38.507]  And I'm going to be there tomorrow, and I hope you'll come out with us, and I want to see you there.
[01:36:39.647 --> 01:36:41.427]  I want to see you there.
[01:36:43.508 --> 01:36:46.648]  Tomorrow, 3.30, at the Capitol, south side of the Capitol.
[01:36:47.188 --> 01:36:55.930]  Not on the Capitol grounds, but right up in between 11th Street, where Congress runs into 11th Street, right in front of the Capitol.
[01:36:56.510 --> 01:37:00.571]  There is an area where a couple hundred people can congregate comfortably in front of the gates.
[01:37:01.252 --> 01:37:15.136]  And it's a no-man's land, and the state police will leave you on there, so will the APD, and then as the Lorican Kistas come marching down, we are going to be there bullhorning them.
[01:37:15.156 --> 01:37:18.778]  I'm going to have to get my bullhorn out of mothballs.
[01:37:18.798 --> 01:37:20.538]  I don't know, I used my bullhorn a few months ago.
[01:37:20.918 --> 01:37:22.979]  I used a gigantic one to bullhorn Parliament.
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:26.000]  But that was a lot of fun.
[01:37:27.617 --> 01:37:31.378]  Two days after I did that, they banned protesting around the Parliament.
[01:37:32.859 --> 01:37:36.960]  And no, that legend has already begun that I got it banned.
[01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:43.822]  They already had the bills introduced and were going to pass it on that Monday, and I was there bullhorning them on a Saturday.
[01:37:44.922 --> 01:37:45.863]  So they were already doing it.
[01:37:46.083 --> 01:37:47.823]  That's why I went there and bullhorned them.
[01:37:47.843 --> 01:37:51.324]  It just so happened that while I was there, they were in the process of banning it.
[01:37:51.364 --> 01:37:53.625]  But regardless, folks, it'll be a lot of fun.
[01:37:54.392 --> 01:37:56.094]  And, I mean, how dare these people?
[01:37:56.134 --> 01:37:57.275]  How dare Lloyd Doggett?
[01:37:57.535 --> 01:38:01.539]  How dare these people sit here and say this isn't Texas?
[01:38:02.119 --> 01:38:03.240]  I mean, that's what they say, folks.
[01:38:04.281 --> 01:38:13.029]  I've got former Mayor Gus Garcia saying that Hispanics are a god race, the supreme, superior race.
[01:38:13.810 --> 01:38:20.196]  And then Daryl Slusher has these Aztec people up there to proclaim it.
[01:38:21.201 --> 01:38:26.746]  And, you know, says, I agree, because he's married to a Hispanic lady, my daughter is a supreme race.
[01:38:27.286 --> 01:38:29.348]  I mean, this is Hitler stuff, folks.
[01:38:30.088 --> 01:38:36.473]  And it's totally acceptable, it's totally kosher with the media, and I'm not putting up with it.
[01:38:36.493 --> 01:38:38.275]  I'm not putting up with it.
[01:38:38.295 --> 01:38:39.175]  For ten seconds.
[01:38:39.335 --> 01:38:43.939]  So, Fox thought he'd come here and walk all over us, and I shut him down.
[01:38:44.279 --> 01:38:45.741]  I shut his press conference down.
[01:38:46.121 --> 01:38:47.382]  And he hasn't been back since.
[01:38:48.203 --> 01:38:52.445]  And I am going to stand up against these people tomorrow and I hope you'll join me.
[01:38:53.465 --> 01:39:02.109]  Alright, now you see I've thrown my lot in against this so I'm now all hyped up and jabbering but let's just accelerate through your calls.
[01:39:02.129 --> 01:39:03.009]  Who's up first here?
[01:39:06.171 --> 01:39:07.211]  Lauren, you're on the air.
[01:39:07.231 --> 01:39:08.212]  Where are you calling us from?
[01:39:09.512 --> 01:39:10.853]  I'm calling from Missouri, Alex.
[01:39:11.193 --> 01:39:11.533]  Welcome.
[01:39:12.589 --> 01:39:13.330]  This is Laura.
[01:39:15.111 --> 01:39:21.134]  Well, you know, we can't get names right, so what we'll do is we're going to start over and I'm going to ask you where you're calling from and what your name is.
[01:39:21.154 --> 01:39:22.214]  Okay.
[01:39:23.035 --> 01:39:23.835]  What is your name, ma'am?
[01:39:24.416 --> 01:39:24.796]  Laura.
[01:39:24.816 --> 01:39:26.837]  Okay, where are you calling from, Laura?
[01:39:27.717 --> 01:39:28.198]  Missouri.
[01:39:28.458 --> 01:39:29.759]  Missouri, okay, thank you.
[01:39:30.159 --> 01:39:31.059]  Welcome, you're on the air.
[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:32.480]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:39.224]  I just wanted to get out there that my husband was at a FEMA distributing...
[01:39:40.202 --> 01:39:43.083]  Distribution Center.
[01:39:43.584 --> 01:39:44.204]  Yeah, center.
[01:39:45.125 --> 01:39:51.028]  And there was lots of truck drivers that were stopped there and have been there for days and weeks.
[01:39:51.468 --> 01:39:53.329]  And like one person was there for like a week.
[01:39:53.909 --> 01:39:58.131]  But these truck drivers have just been sitting there waiting to get filled with ice.
[01:39:58.992 --> 01:40:03.974]  Yeah, how long ago was this that they wouldn't let you wouldn't let them bring the supplies in?
[01:40:05.075 --> 01:40:05.935]  The supplies in?
[01:40:07.376 --> 01:40:08.516]  I'm not sure about that.
[01:40:08.597 --> 01:40:09.437]  My husband was just
[01:40:09.969 --> 01:40:10.729]  Just stop there.
[01:40:10.749 --> 01:40:16.792]  I mean, he wasn't, you know, picking up a load there or anything, but these other truck drivers... But he said that, I mean, how long ago was this?
[01:40:16.812 --> 01:40:18.773]  And then that'll tell us how long they've been there.
[01:40:19.633 --> 01:40:20.634]  It was last night.
[01:40:21.694 --> 01:40:27.837]  It was last night, and... Yeah, well, people are so generous in America that we let LaRique and Kisa's walk all over us.
[01:40:28.237 --> 01:40:36.741]  We also have sent so much food and water that it literally is piled up to the rafters in hundreds of warehouses, and FEMA's never letting any of it get in.
[01:40:37.061 --> 01:40:37.281]  No.
[01:40:37.882 --> 01:40:38.302]  And Alex?
[01:40:38.888 --> 01:40:42.449]  They're putting security cameras on all the trucks there.
[01:40:42.829 --> 01:40:46.489]  They're putting cameras on the trucks that are stopped there to pick up loads.
[01:40:48.130 --> 01:40:49.750]  Oh, to make sure they don't steal.
[01:40:50.550 --> 01:40:57.391]  Well, it's like 1,500 firefighters show up to volunteer while the city had, you know, multiple fires at any one time burning.
[01:40:57.631 --> 01:41:01.492]  And they said, okay, it's time for your seven days of anti-sexual harassment training.
[01:41:01.512 --> 01:41:02.752]  Mm-hmm.
[01:41:03.572 --> 01:41:07.033]  Where you learn to be politically correct and lay down to a little reconquista.
[01:41:08.536 --> 01:41:13.058]  I mean, imagine if we went to Mexico about the thousands and said, this is our country.
[01:41:13.258 --> 01:41:14.799]  Of course, they'll say, well, this is Mexico.
[01:41:15.039 --> 01:41:17.260]  This was never Mexico, folks.
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:18.301]  It was the Spanish.
[01:41:18.341 --> 01:41:19.221]  It was the French.
[01:41:19.281 --> 01:41:25.705]  It was the... I mean, yeah, Mexico had a few forts and a few people here, and then most of them stayed here and are happy ever after.
[01:41:25.725 --> 01:41:27.185]  I mean, I'm sick of it.
[01:41:27.626 --> 01:41:30.367]  Mexico is just some territory dominated by Spain.
[01:41:30.607 --> 01:41:32.288]  So stop acting like it's your country.
[01:41:32.328 --> 01:41:32.748]  It's not.
[01:41:33.048 --> 01:41:33.468]  I'm sorry.
[01:41:34.409 --> 01:41:34.789]  I'm sorry.
[01:41:34.809 --> 01:41:36.010]  I'm getting hyped up.
[01:41:36.050 --> 01:41:36.350]  Go ahead.
[01:41:37.171 --> 01:41:51.717]  And Alex, before this had happened, I'd had a dream that I was driving in my car and it was real life and there was leaf and black ski masks blocking off the highway.
[01:41:52.057 --> 01:41:52.758]  Oh, they're good.
[01:41:52.878 --> 01:41:56.459]  And they had stopped me and told me to get out of my car.
[01:41:57.179 --> 01:41:59.761]  And they had checked me to make sure I didn't have anything on me.
[01:42:00.701 --> 01:42:03.042]  And they put me on a stretcher.
[01:42:03.062 --> 01:42:04.803]  All of a sudden, I was on a stretcher.
[01:42:04.903 --> 01:42:05.483]  My belly was
[01:42:06.804 --> 01:42:21.512]  You know, my back was... I was laying on my belly, and I could see that they were putting a big needle in my neck, and it was for a microchip, and... Oh, yes.
[01:42:21.572 --> 01:42:30.778]  No, I think that's... Your brain is manifesting the reality of what's coming, that the troops are being trained to forcibly inject us official Army documents.
[01:42:31.258 --> 01:42:34.740]  They are openly talking about it on the news, and when they shut off the nukes...
[01:42:35.552 --> 01:42:43.698]  Then, you know, a year or two after, after the whole breakdown of society, then they're going to have armed goons running around that will do anything to keep that power.
[01:42:44.138 --> 01:42:45.980]  And I know that's scary, and it should be scary.
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:46.960]  I'm glad you... You know what, Alex?
[01:42:47.260 --> 01:42:48.601]  I'm going to stand against it.
[01:42:48.721 --> 01:42:50.062]  I am not going to fall.
[01:42:50.643 --> 01:42:58.468]  I know, you know, that I'm just going to tell as many people as possible, and if we just all stand together, you know, and hold our own...
[01:42:59.813 --> 01:43:00.714]  They will fail.
[01:43:01.155 --> 01:43:08.042]  My husband was there at that distribution center, and he was telling people how bad FEMA is, how corrupt they are.
[01:43:08.623 --> 01:43:13.688]  And the people that worked in FEMA, the people who were in the front desk, ran away.
[01:43:13.888 --> 01:43:14.809]  They ran away.
[01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:19.474]  You know, they just went out of the room into another room because they're scared.
[01:43:19.855 --> 01:43:20.756]  They are scared.
[01:43:21.638 --> 01:43:28.384]  If good people can stand against them and they don't be weak, they will get scared and they will tolerate away.
[01:43:28.804 --> 01:43:37.212]  They will not... Well, they tried to bluster and say we couldn't come back in the city and that they wanted all our guns and then people didn't go along with it.
[01:43:39.214 --> 01:43:40.315]  Well, good job.
[01:43:40.455 --> 01:43:41.496]  Listen, you keep it up.
[01:43:42.498 --> 01:43:45.079]  You keep it up, and God bless you, and take care.
[01:43:45.439 --> 01:43:47.259]  No, we should be crying.
[01:43:47.299 --> 01:43:48.260]  We should be freaked out.
[01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:52.141]  We've got foreigners stomping all over us, going, We're the race!
[01:43:52.801 --> 01:43:53.561]  For our race!
[01:43:53.901 --> 01:43:54.361]  Everything!
[01:43:54.421 --> 01:43:54.922]  For you!
[01:43:55.062 --> 01:43:55.462]  Nothing!
[01:43:55.662 --> 01:43:56.562]  We've got signs!
[01:43:56.602 --> 01:43:57.822]  We're going to kill you!
[01:43:58.122 --> 01:43:58.943]  They hold up signs.
[01:43:58.963 --> 01:44:00.003]  We're going to murder you!
[01:44:00.043 --> 01:44:02.244]  And the media goes, Oh, aren't they sweet?
[01:44:02.744 --> 01:44:04.384]  Aren't they good?
[01:44:04.804 --> 01:44:05.885]  Aren't they nice?
[01:44:05.945 --> 01:44:07.785]  You're bad if you're against it.
[01:44:08.545 --> 01:44:10.426]  You're bad if you're not for it.
[01:44:13.317 --> 01:44:13.918]  It's sick.
[01:44:14.499 --> 01:44:16.201]  They got Bush prancing around.
[01:44:16.922 --> 01:44:18.243]  All these people prancing around.
[01:44:18.304 --> 01:44:19.064]  I'm sick of it.
[01:44:19.405 --> 01:44:20.426]  I'm not putting up with it.
[01:44:22.529 --> 01:44:23.090]  I mean, folks!
[01:44:24.406 --> 01:44:30.349]  Andy Rooney, Senator Biden, Sean Hannity, dozens and dozens of shows on TV.
[01:44:30.489 --> 01:44:31.669]  Everybody needs a chip.
[01:44:31.829 --> 01:44:32.630]  Oh, it's so cool.
[01:44:32.950 --> 01:44:34.951]  In the near future, you may be made to take a chip.
[01:44:35.271 --> 01:44:36.932]  I've had the CEO of the company on.
[01:44:36.952 --> 01:44:38.112]  I've had the chief scientist on.
[01:44:38.493 --> 01:44:40.373]  I've had their European head distributor on.
[01:44:41.114 --> 01:44:45.096]  I've had the sheriff of Bergen County on.
[01:44:45.116 --> 01:44:50.398]  He said, yeah, I've taken the chip, and I think we ought to force everybody to take it, and I'll enforce that.
[01:44:51.010 --> 01:44:52.091]  I mean, they all say it.
[01:44:52.611 --> 01:44:54.592]  I had the European distributor on.
[01:44:54.612 --> 01:44:55.933]  He said, the chip will prevail.
[01:44:56.213 --> 01:44:58.555]  Yes, there is a day coming when everyone will have to have a chip.
[01:44:58.895 --> 01:44:59.615]  It's good.
[01:45:00.116 --> 01:45:01.516]  That's their plan, folks.
[01:45:03.338 --> 01:45:04.158]  That's their plan.
[01:45:05.419 --> 01:45:06.239]  That's their plan.
[01:45:06.339 --> 01:45:10.502]  And they can't have a middle class because a middle class is self-sufficient in...
[01:45:11.369 --> 01:45:12.369]  Not dependent on them.
[01:45:12.629 --> 01:45:14.990]  So they're going to drive our wages down.
[01:45:15.010 --> 01:45:16.491]  They're going to break our economy down.
[01:45:17.031 --> 01:45:19.072]  You think 30 million illegals is bad.
[01:45:19.172 --> 01:45:22.913]  Oh, they've got plans for 30 million more in the next 10 years.
[01:45:23.273 --> 01:45:24.573]  And then it's going to accelerate.
[01:45:24.633 --> 01:45:29.615]  Once they've got that voting block, those fools are going to vote to open the borders, and it's all the Latin Americans.
[01:45:30.447 --> 01:45:32.028]  And there are 20 new million births a year.
[01:45:32.168 --> 01:45:33.429]  And it's Chinese.
[01:45:33.750 --> 01:45:35.111]  And it's all the Russians.
[01:45:35.431 --> 01:45:36.372]  And it's Africa.
[01:45:36.452 --> 01:45:37.273]  Just all of it.
[01:45:37.313 --> 01:45:37.913]  And Asia.
[01:45:38.253 --> 01:45:39.915]  Just pouring in.
[01:45:40.295 --> 01:45:42.517]  America will look like Blade Runner.
[01:45:46.140 --> 01:45:47.341]  And then it isn't going to matter.
[01:45:47.401 --> 01:45:50.943]  It's just going to be a mad scrabble for resources which they control.
[01:45:51.324 --> 01:45:53.485]  We're being brought down right now.
[01:45:53.766 --> 01:45:54.306]  Listen to me.
[01:45:54.666 --> 01:45:55.187]  Listen to me.
[01:45:56.031 --> 01:45:59.513]  I want Hispanics, and I want blacks, and I want whites.
[01:45:59.673 --> 01:46:00.694]  I want Americans.
[01:46:00.734 --> 01:46:02.535]  You are all welcome and loved.
[01:46:03.316 --> 01:46:07.098]  And at every one of the rallies I've had against the Lurican cases, we've had a lot of Hispanics show up.
[01:46:07.598 --> 01:46:08.859]  I want you there tomorrow!
[01:46:09.870 --> 01:46:19.473]  Because that'll help the Hispanics who've been conned, who are with these little reconquistas, who've been told that America's evil and Texas is evil and they don't know history.
[01:46:19.733 --> 01:46:21.973]  They're ignorant just like everybody else in America is.
[01:46:22.353 --> 01:46:25.474]  When they see that, it really flips them.
[01:46:25.794 --> 01:46:27.655]  And I'm going to be there explaining to them.
[01:46:28.035 --> 01:46:30.255]  Last time we had somebody in Spanish there explaining it to them.
[01:46:30.855 --> 01:46:33.956]  We're going to be there explaining this to them and breaking the conditioning.
[01:46:35.317 --> 01:46:36.657]  So we need you there tomorrow.
[01:46:38.095 --> 01:46:50.382]  To stand up against this disgusting piece of filth, Lloyd Doggett, who I've confronted several times of old, but a long time, it's probably been eight years since I've stood and confronted Lord Doggett.
[01:46:51.183 --> 01:47:03.230]  And I will stand up and I will speak out against that piece of filth who wants to be a robber baron, who wants to sit over this racial divide.
[01:47:04.102 --> 01:47:05.623]  I mean, this is insane, folks.
[01:47:06.324 --> 01:47:15.852]  Again, the name of the organizations, METCHA, which is a big acronym for the Aztec-ian rulership takeover, basically.
[01:47:16.412 --> 01:47:20.856]  And then, I forget the exact term, and then their motto is, for our race, everything, outside the race, nothing.
[01:47:21.436 --> 01:47:23.178]  And then, what does La Raza mean?
[01:47:23.198 --> 01:47:25.379]  La Raza, the race.
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:28.382]  They've got radio stations around here called the race.
[01:47:29.263 --> 01:47:30.804]  There's another one called the invader.
[01:47:32.924 --> 01:47:34.405]  And my wife speaks fluent Spanish, man.
[01:47:34.425 --> 01:47:34.826]  She's heard it.
[01:47:34.886 --> 01:47:39.589]  I mean, it's just like... Hey, I'm sick of it.
[01:47:39.829 --> 01:47:42.812]  You're being played like a fiddle by the New World Order.
[01:47:43.832 --> 01:47:45.153]  And I will stand against it.
[01:47:47.275 --> 01:47:49.437]  You're not going to get anything out of this, you fools.
[01:47:51.038 --> 01:47:52.999]  And again, your La Rica and Quisa leaders know that.
[01:47:53.019 --> 01:47:54.761]  A lot of them are CIA and FBI.
[01:47:55.081 --> 01:47:56.602]  They were all trained at big universities.
[01:47:56.642 --> 01:47:57.843]  They're on the payroll, folks.
[01:47:58.473 --> 01:48:06.635]  Just like Gloria Steinem was CIA, she admits, and Miss Magazine was a CIA front to break up the family and turn women and men against each other.
[01:48:06.895 --> 01:48:11.556]  And the big textbooks they use for social workers calling the family a disease.
[01:48:11.876 --> 01:48:19.058]  I want to tell Hispanics who are very pro-family and have got a lot of great values and are a people I frankly like, let me tell you something.
[01:48:20.274 --> 01:48:21.235]  You love your family?
[01:48:21.295 --> 01:48:25.557]  The people you've thrown your lot in with are sworn to destroy your families.
[01:48:25.837 --> 01:48:28.858]  Did you know that Lloyd Doggett and the rest of them love Planned Parenthood?
[01:48:29.018 --> 01:48:36.062]  And did you know Margaret Singer, the founder of it, gave awards to Hitler, got awards from Hitler, called black people and Mexicans weeds?
[01:48:36.922 --> 01:48:40.424]  You know you're thrown in with people that call you weeds?
[01:48:41.145 --> 01:48:43.426]  You're thrown in with people that call you subhuman?
[01:48:45.086 --> 01:48:47.868]  Now you will join me and you will join me now!
[01:48:48.999 --> 01:48:50.499]  You will preserve your family.
[01:48:51.579 --> 01:48:53.420]  You will get your head screwed on straight.
[01:48:53.980 --> 01:48:55.540]  And you will come down there tomorrow.
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:48:58.321]  This is about survival.
[01:48:59.161 --> 01:49:00.641]  You will see through the fog.
[01:49:00.841 --> 01:49:02.021]  You will see through the lies.
[01:49:02.281 --> 01:49:04.482]  And you will wake up and you will think for yourself.
[01:49:04.542 --> 01:49:06.382]  And you know in your guts I'm telling you the truth.
[01:49:06.562 --> 01:49:07.662]  You listen to me right now.
[01:49:07.902 --> 01:49:12.283]  Every one of you yuppies and liberal white people that control the Lurican Keystone.
[01:49:12.403 --> 01:49:12.803]  All of you.
[01:49:13.043 --> 01:49:15.283]  You better get out of what you've been involved in.
[01:49:15.463 --> 01:49:16.764]  You're destroying this country.
[01:49:16.904 --> 01:49:18.404]  And you're not going to get power out of it.
[01:49:19.065 --> 01:49:23.470]  We're dealing with very evil, cunning controllers that are manipulating us against each other.
[01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:26.553]  We have got to come together against the New World Order.
[01:49:26.774 --> 01:49:29.457]  We've got to come together against the New World Order right now!
[01:49:30.197 --> 01:49:31.519]  Rally to me!
[01:49:31.799 --> 01:49:32.580]  Tomorrow!
[01:49:33.721 --> 01:49:32.580]  3.30!
[01:49:33.842 --> 01:49:35.043]  South side of the Capitol!
[01:49:35.443 --> 01:49:36.925]  Rally to me!
[01:49:37.385 --> 01:49:37.806]  Do it!
[01:49:38.006 --> 01:49:39.147]  Defend the Republic!
[01:49:39.388 --> 01:49:40.369]  Defend Texas!
[01:49:40.890 --> 01:49:43.775]  Fellow Texians, and that goes for the Tejados, everybody.
[01:49:43.996 --> 01:49:44.898]  This is our state.
[01:49:45.178 --> 01:49:46.100]  This is our country.
[01:49:46.140 --> 01:49:47.022]  This is America.
[01:49:47.223 --> 01:49:51.070]  It doesn't belong to Bush or Vicente Fox or the Lurican Kistas.
[01:49:53.920 --> 01:50:00.747]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:01.067 --> 01:50:02.449]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.649 --> 01:50:04.851]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:05.011 --> 01:50:07.093]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:07.374 --> 01:50:12.299]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:12.639 --> 01:50:16.683]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:16.903 --> 01:50:18.684]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:18.704 --> 01:50:29.409]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.569 --> 01:50:31.470]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:50:31.650 --> 01:50:35.552]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[01:50:35.632 --> 01:50:37.193]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[01:50:37.213 --> 01:50:37.713]  That's 888-2533-139.
[01:50:44.096 --> 01:50:47.679]  Or order online at InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net.
[01:50:47.980 --> 01:50:50.422]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[01:50:51.503 --> 01:50:57.027]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:50:57.388 --> 01:51:06.216]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:51:06.536 --> 01:51:11.200]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:11.660 --> 01:51:18.384]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:18.784 --> 01:51:30.531]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:31.031 --> 01:51:35.493]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:51:35.673 --> 01:51:37.994]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:38.014 --> 01:51:39.975]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:51:39.995 --> 01:51:41.196]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:41.256 --> 01:51:42.717]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:51:42.737 --> 01:51:43.797]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:51:54.662 --> 01:52:00.611]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:52:00.831 --> 01:52:03.094]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:52:03.275 --> 01:52:09.644]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:52:09.964 --> 01:52:10.605]  We're good to go.
[01:52:30.199 --> 01:52:30.819]  We're good to go.
[01:52:56.205 --> 01:53:06.211]  Last week, all the major TV stations and radio stations and the sell-out neocon radio stations have been perpetually promoting, come out for Mexican Independence Day.
[01:53:06.931 --> 01:53:09.373]  They would damage in Texas today, though.
[01:53:09.433 --> 01:53:10.573]  Oh, that's evil.
[01:53:11.474 --> 01:53:17.878]  And they've all quietly covered it up that this is Mecha and Maraza and the rest of it and despicable Lloyd Doggett.
[01:53:18.942 --> 01:53:20.464]  And again, get out of the left-right paradigm.
[01:53:20.504 --> 01:53:24.830]  Michael McCall's just as despicable, or more so, on a host of other fronts.
[01:53:26.653 --> 01:53:28.996]  It's just now time to resist these people.
[01:53:30.478 --> 01:53:31.660]  And I want to see you down there tomorrow.
[01:53:33.735 --> 01:53:37.017]  We're going to go to Fred and Howard and Betty and a bunch of other callers.
[01:53:37.037 --> 01:53:38.898]  We've got a whole other hour coming up with tons of news.
[01:53:39.338 --> 01:53:40.779]  I've got to plug this at least once.
[01:53:41.139 --> 01:53:42.460]  I didn't talk about it in the first hour.
[01:53:43.640 --> 01:53:51.724]  Number one, the way you support this broadcast and what we do, if you believe in what we're doing, is my documentary films and the books and other videos and things we carry on InfoWars.com.
[01:53:52.845 --> 01:53:57.807]  Plus, of the best books and videos I've found out there, bar none, that we carry in our shopping cart and our store.
[01:53:59.689 --> 01:54:02.550]  Also, you can get any of my 12 films.
[01:54:02.710 --> 01:54:05.451]  Big discounts when you get multiple titles.
[01:54:05.511 --> 01:54:14.414]  I mean, you can get American Dictators, one of my best documentaries about the false left-right paradigm, Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, for $5.95 when you buy one copy for $19.95.
[01:54:15.814 --> 01:54:17.175]  Just because I want to get it out to people.
[01:54:17.195 --> 01:54:21.156]  So you'll get one copy for yourself and another copy to give as a gift in a nice package.
[01:54:22.396 --> 01:54:24.117]  Also, Martial Law.
[01:54:24.157 --> 01:54:25.137]  It's a miniseries.
[01:54:25.637 --> 01:54:27.858]  And it covers who the globalists are and how they operate.
[01:54:28.727 --> 01:54:29.588]  Three hours long, $24.95.
[01:54:30.408 --> 01:54:32.249]  Get a second copy for $19.95.

[01:54:38.792 --> 01:54:42.755]  Whenever you order three or more of any of the titles.
[01:54:43.875 --> 01:54:45.736]  And I carry a bunch of other great videos.
[01:54:46.256 --> 01:54:49.778]  The JPFO's pro-gun video is just amazing.
[01:54:50.979 --> 01:54:53.300]  The loss of liberty video about that terrorist attack.
[01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:54.541]  To be blamed on Egypt.
[01:54:55.040 --> 01:54:56.461]  I mean, these are all important.
[01:54:56.921 --> 01:54:57.981]  And you need to have them.

[01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:42.523]  South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:55:44.325 --> 01:55:47.708]  Let's go ahead and I want to go to Howard first.
[01:55:48.088 --> 01:55:49.129]  Howard, go ahead.
[01:55:49.149 --> 01:55:49.629]  You're on the air.
[01:55:49.649 --> 01:55:51.091]  Hello?
[01:55:51.491 --> 01:55:51.751]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:52.091 --> 01:55:53.032]  Hey, how are you doing today?
[01:55:53.973 --> 01:55:54.694]  Good, good.
[01:55:54.914 --> 01:55:56.195]  I know you're going to love this.
[01:55:56.635 --> 01:55:59.358]  I live up here in a little town just south of Grand Rapids, Michigan.
[01:56:00.439 --> 01:56:04.242]  And we had an emergency drill that basically went live today.
[01:56:06.626 --> 01:56:14.319]  They were... Kent County was holding an emergency disaster exercise and it was suspended because of a suspicious package.
[01:56:14.739 --> 01:56:16.282]  Apparently a bomb threat had been called in.
[01:56:17.528 --> 01:56:19.871]  The feds have been doing that for 10 years.
[01:56:20.271 --> 01:56:22.153]  They'll leave packages that say anthrax.
[01:56:22.193 --> 01:56:23.475]  They'll leave suspicious packages.
[01:56:23.775 --> 01:56:25.777]  Or they'll call in a fake threat.
[01:56:25.837 --> 01:56:28.440]  This letter came out, say, on Greyhound Bus.
[01:56:28.900 --> 01:56:33.945]  Then they pull over a real Greyhound Bus and search it with three different teams for nine hours.
[01:56:34.286 --> 01:56:38.090]  We caught video of that going on in Temple, Texas.
[01:56:38.806 --> 01:56:40.308]  So, absolutely.
[01:56:40.789 --> 01:56:46.035]  Look, they declared a fake nuclear spill in 2000 here in Texas and later admitted it was fake.
[01:56:46.456 --> 01:56:47.057]  They do this.
[01:56:47.097 --> 01:56:47.657]  They're criminals.
[01:56:47.677 --> 01:56:48.699]  Go ahead and finish up.
[01:56:49.119 --> 01:56:53.044]  Apparently it involved 300 first responders and 900 volunteer victims.
[01:56:53.104 --> 01:56:54.846]  And the 900 were, you know, school kids.
[01:56:55.607 --> 01:57:07.056]  Oh yeah, it's always the same, and they'll tell them homeschoolers are going to attack you, they'll splatter fake blood on them, and kids, instead of going to school now, learn to go lay down and have men with guns and machine guns at them.
[01:57:07.496 --> 01:57:09.318]  Run, run, fear, fear, fear.
[01:57:09.358 --> 01:57:10.539]  So this was on the news?
[01:57:10.959 --> 01:57:11.920]  Yeah, it was on the news.
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:13.341]  I emailed you the link.
[01:57:14.381 --> 01:57:15.783]  Listen, we've got to get that posted.
[01:57:16.823 --> 01:57:18.625]  Will you tape it off the news and send it to me?
[01:57:19.365 --> 01:57:20.586]  Uh, I can try.
[01:57:20.646 --> 01:57:22.648]  I don't know if I can get my visa.
[01:57:22.668 --> 01:57:23.308]  You know what, stay there.
[01:57:23.328 --> 01:57:24.489]  I want to talk to you on the other side.
[01:57:24.830 --> 01:57:27.231]  Oh yeah, they'll be replaying it tonight, terrorizing you.
[01:57:27.592 --> 01:57:29.213]  This is the nature of terrorism.
[01:57:29.253 --> 01:57:31.895]  They're training you how to be captured by them.
[01:57:33.997 --> 01:57:37.900]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:39.001]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:50.285 --> 01:57:50.925]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.586 --> 01:57:52.686]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.366 --> 01:57:54.486]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.147 --> 01:57:55.947]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.687 --> 01:57:58.227]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.267 --> 01:58:01.928]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.448 --> 01:58:06.589]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:11.311 --> 01:58:12.911]  Ah, the great spirit of...
[01:58:14.025 --> 01:58:27.214]  Texas Independence, we're going to be resisting the federally manipulated Hispanic Ku Klux Klan groups that are going to be led by seditionist Lloyd Doggett tomorrow when they march down to the Capitol at 4 o'clock.
[01:58:27.254 --> 01:58:28.175]  We'll be waiting for them.
[01:58:29.075 --> 01:58:40.063]  They're at the front of the Capitol there in between the 11th Street where Congress dead ends, right there in that no man's land, right in front of the gates of the Capitol.
[01:58:40.103 --> 01:58:40.703]  We'll be there.
[01:58:40.783 --> 01:58:42.044]  Be there tomorrow!
[01:58:42.799 --> 01:58:43.920]  I want to see you there.
[01:58:45.140 --> 01:58:48.882]  And I'd like it if other talk show hosts here locally would talk about this and be there as well.
[01:58:49.162 --> 01:58:55.725]  The mainstream media has had all week to promote this and lavish this, and I've just been so busy working and stuff and so sick of it, I've ignored it.
[01:58:55.765 --> 01:58:58.846]  But I watched some TV last night, folks, and that was the end of it.
[01:58:58.866 --> 01:59:00.227]  I mean, just the slathering.
[01:59:00.547 --> 01:59:06.431]  Pancrit of America, openly being pushed by these big, fat corporations, using these La Reconquistas.
[01:59:06.791 --> 01:59:11.435]  It made my blood boil, and I refuse to be walked on or spit on by anybody.
[01:59:11.655 --> 01:59:15.217]  And we're going to stand up against these invaders tomorrow, and I want to see you there.
[01:59:16.218 --> 01:59:23.503]  All right, let's go ahead and go back to the caller, Howard, then we'll go to Fred, Buddy, and many others.
[01:59:24.204 --> 01:59:34.993]  Howard's up in Michigan, and I've been to, I don't know, probably six or seven of these, where they actually announce that while a drill's going, they'll always announce it's real.
[01:59:36.114 --> 01:59:48.865]  And you see the shifty-eyed behavior of the mayor and the police, and then a week later they'll go, yeah, we put the package there that said anthrax just to make it more real, which if you were I, I was ten years in prison.
[01:59:49.685 --> 01:59:49.825]  And...
[01:59:51.304 --> 01:59:52.225]  It's totally criminal.
[01:59:52.285 --> 01:59:57.267]  I mean, they've created panics where they declare nuclear spills on IH35 and then later say it was a drill.
[01:59:57.287 --> 01:59:58.968]  I mean, where I live, they do this.
[01:59:59.028 --> 01:59:59.968]  It's totally criminal.
[02:00:00.609 --> 02:00:01.549]  And he just described it.
[02:00:01.889 --> 02:00:08.112]  900 school children playing the part of murdered citizens with the police running around pointing machine guns at them.
[02:00:08.372 --> 02:00:10.233]  And remember what was in the AP last year.
[02:00:10.553 --> 02:00:17.276]  They had drills in Michigan and in Texas where they practiced where they told them, homeschoolers are coming to kill you.
[02:00:18.077 --> 02:00:20.338]  This is a drill where homeschoolers kill you.
[02:00:21.497 --> 02:00:25.063]  And so the kids are all traumatized and taught, homeschoolers are going to murder you.
[02:00:25.344 --> 02:00:27.728]  I mean, this is like Soviet re-education.
[02:00:27.968 --> 02:00:31.495]  The Soviets didn't get that sophisticated in their re-education camps.
[02:00:32.535 --> 02:00:40.981]  They didn't tell them, you know, that the... I mean, folks, this is like propping somebody's eyes open and making them watch a movie screen while you inject them with psychotropics.
[02:00:41.081 --> 02:00:43.162]  I mean, this is like clockwork orange.
[02:00:43.702 --> 02:00:44.883]  We live in a hell pit!
[02:00:44.923 --> 02:00:46.144]  We live in a scum pit!
[02:00:46.444 --> 02:00:56.811]  There's all this good stuff still around us, all these wonderful things that America had because of liberty, and then there's this evil just taking it all over right in front of us, this creeping death, this total insanity.
[02:00:57.031 --> 02:00:57.911]  I'm sick of it!
[02:00:59.112 --> 02:01:00.033]  My gosh!
[02:01:00.962 --> 02:01:04.085]  Torturing children, telling them homeschoolers are going to come murder them?
[02:01:04.385 --> 02:01:06.487]  Finish up with the drill up in Michigan, sir.
[02:01:06.747 --> 02:01:09.029]  Well, anyway, this is all ongoing.
[02:01:09.069 --> 02:01:10.831]  This just went down this morning.
[02:01:10.851 --> 02:01:16.896]  I kind of want to apologize for chuckling, but it's just, I mean, how retarded do you have to be not to see through it?
[02:01:17.616 --> 02:01:20.959]  If it wasn't for the toll on human lives, it would be a comedy.
[02:01:21.640 --> 02:01:21.780]  But,
[02:01:23.138 --> 02:01:23.879]  I don't know.
[02:01:23.959 --> 02:01:25.080]  I'm just a truck driver.
[02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:28.404]  I'm just a high school education, not a college educator, nothing.
[02:01:29.004 --> 02:01:30.306]  Like what happened with Katrina.
[02:01:30.606 --> 02:01:33.289]  I mean, last Saturday I was telling people, look, this is what's going to happen.
[02:01:33.309 --> 02:01:34.831]  Boom, boom, boom, right on down the line.
[02:01:35.832 --> 02:01:37.213]  And all week long, there it was.
[02:01:38.134 --> 02:01:42.439]  What college really does in many cases, unless it's an engineering type degree that's needed,
[02:01:43.195 --> 02:01:43.356]  I think?
[02:01:53.922 --> 02:01:55.664]  It teaches you what to think, not how to think.
[02:01:56.024 --> 02:01:56.664]  Exactly.
[02:01:56.684 --> 02:01:57.785]  That's what school's all about.
[02:01:57.805 --> 02:02:05.192]  Whereas somebody who has their own business and has been working since they were 14 years old knows a hundred times what some drooling yuppie knows.
[02:02:05.792 --> 02:02:08.194]  Some drooling yuppie that needs to be punched in the face!
[02:02:08.535 --> 02:02:10.677]  I'm sitting there, you know, I listen to the federal government.
[02:02:11.097 --> 02:02:17.062]  I mean, to listen to them talk, you would need some sort of certified genius to run any sort of disaster relief.
[02:02:17.122 --> 02:02:18.824]  And really all it takes is basically...
[02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:21.061]  Your average, you know.
[02:02:21.281 --> 02:02:21.821]  Look, look.
[02:02:21.901 --> 02:02:24.162]  The local police tried to bring in food and water.
[02:02:24.223 --> 02:02:25.243]  Everything was jammed.
[02:02:25.483 --> 02:02:26.344]  FEMA wouldn't let them.
[02:02:26.384 --> 02:02:26.904]  They did it.
[02:02:27.144 --> 02:02:28.025]  Caught red-handed.
[02:02:28.985 --> 02:02:30.426]  It's disgusting.
[02:02:30.466 --> 02:02:31.066]  Thanks for the call.
[02:02:31.386 --> 02:02:33.868]  They had to have a screw-up to then get more funds.
[02:02:33.908 --> 02:02:34.388]  It's simple.
[02:02:35.489 --> 02:02:36.389]  Bunch of scum.
[02:02:36.409 --> 02:02:40.671]  Alright, I'm going into my little scum spasms.
[02:02:41.232 --> 02:02:43.713]  I yell scum, but it's just I'm getting angry.
[02:02:47.037 --> 02:02:49.919]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:50.159 --> 02:02:51.740]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:56.743]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:57.084 --> 02:03:03.808]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:04.148 --> 02:03:06.128]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:06.329 --> 02:03:09.189]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:09.269 --> 02:03:13.930]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:14.130 --> 02:03:18.551]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.791 --> 02:03:25.993]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:26.253 --> 02:03:28.674]  Discover the document of truth for yourself before it's too late.

[02:03:46.013 --> 02:03:51.314]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[02:03:51.494 --> 02:03:53.575]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[02:03:53.815 --> 02:04:00.936]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[02:04:01.056 --> 02:04:12.579]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[02:04:12.919 --> 02:04:13.700]  We're good to go.
[02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:48.684]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:04:48.925 --> 02:04:52.768]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[02:04:53.088 --> 02:04:53.909]  Read the labels.
[02:04:54.329 --> 02:04:58.473]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:04:58.673 --> 02:05:02.877]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:05:03.237 --> 02:05:08.122]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:05:08.482 --> 02:05:12.064]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:05:12.264 --> 02:05:17.607]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:05:17.867 --> 02:05:20.608]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:05:20.909 --> 02:05:21.809]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:05:22.109 --> 02:05:27.852]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[02:05:51.710 --> 02:05:52.751]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.471 --> 02:05:54.591]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:55.251 --> 02:05:56.051]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.812 --> 02:05:57.892]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.372 --> 02:06:02.053]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.553 --> 02:06:06.694]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:06.874 --> 02:06:15.076]  Alright, we're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:06:18.411 --> 02:06:23.833]  And we were just talking to Howard in Michigan, another urban warfare drill.
[02:06:24.514 --> 02:06:27.055]  I've seen hundreds in the newspapers over the years.
[02:06:27.135 --> 02:06:31.697]  I've been to over ten military drills.
[02:06:31.757 --> 02:06:38.861]  I've been to, I don't know, five, six, seven of these, or witnessed where I live several other drills where they announce a nuclear spill has happened.
[02:06:38.881 --> 02:06:40.142]  The military is being called out.
[02:06:40.222 --> 02:06:41.222]  Serious emergency.
[02:06:41.863 --> 02:06:46.245]  And then at about midnight, five hours after it starts, with I-35 shut down in total panic,
[02:06:48.163 --> 02:06:51.744]  People having wrecks, people leaving the city, they announce, oh, it was just a drip.
[02:06:53.285 --> 02:07:03.208]  And it was the government that mailed itself that fake anthrax, just a test, for five years before the feds really did it in 2001, and Bush and his whole cabinet were on Cipro.
[02:07:04.128 --> 02:07:06.729]  But then, I've been to these, folks.
[02:07:06.789 --> 02:07:07.749]  I've been to these in Austin.
[02:07:08.109 --> 02:07:09.210]  I've been to these in Belton.
[02:07:10.370 --> 02:07:11.671]  I've been to these all over the country.
[02:07:13.351 --> 02:07:14.531]  They'll take anywhere between 20 and 100.
[02:07:16.798 --> 02:07:18.259]  Some cases, you just said on the news, 900.
[02:07:18.439 --> 02:07:20.620]  I've seen the most, about 250.
[02:07:21.981 --> 02:07:26.163]  Elementary, middle school students, and they pour red jelly all over them.
[02:07:26.843 --> 02:07:29.324]  And they put fake arms and legs on them that look real.
[02:07:29.424 --> 02:07:30.485]  Fake guts hanging out.
[02:07:30.985 --> 02:07:31.565]  Legs blown.
[02:07:32.025 --> 02:07:32.926]  Fake dead bodies.
[02:07:33.743 --> 02:07:36.585]  And the police run around with machine guns playing the part of terrorists.
[02:07:36.645 --> 02:07:37.566]  I'm going to kill you!
[02:07:37.846 --> 02:07:39.408]  I'm here from the homeschoolers!
[02:07:39.688 --> 02:07:44.352]  I'm the homeschoolers against public education, and I'm going to kill you!
[02:07:44.372 --> 02:07:47.254]  I mean, that's Jim Jones' mind control, folks.
[02:07:48.055 --> 02:07:49.115]  Uh-oh, you're doubting me right now.
[02:07:49.135 --> 02:07:49.896]  Just type it into Google.
[02:07:50.076 --> 02:07:51.838]  You'll get AP, World Net Daily, you name it.
[02:07:52.838 --> 02:07:59.584]  And local newspapers reported even more than what's in AP and World Net Daily, but they admit they did drills where they told them homeschoolers are going to kill you.
[02:08:00.456 --> 02:08:01.318]  And put the stuff on them.
[02:08:02.200 --> 02:08:09.718]  And imagine, they got ketchup squirters, you know, the stuff they use in the restaurants, full of red jelly.
[02:08:10.815 --> 02:08:11.496]  Fake blood.
[02:08:11.536 --> 02:08:12.236]  Halloween blood.
[02:08:12.256 --> 02:08:14.938]  They just spray it all over little kids, and the kids cry.
[02:08:15.459 --> 02:08:16.479]  Well, it's in Road to Tyranny.
[02:08:16.500 --> 02:08:23.385]  We show the kids crying with the police and the drills, and the little girls are going, They're like, Red Leader Team!
[02:08:23.405 --> 02:08:24.265]  Militia!
[02:08:24.305 --> 02:08:24.746]  Delta!
[02:08:24.766 --> 02:08:25.906]  Kill the children!
[02:08:26.127 --> 02:08:28.849]  And the children are crying, and the police are, It's for your own good!
[02:08:29.429 --> 02:08:37.715]  And then they had a case in Detroit where they shot the little girl in the face because one of the cops had a loaded gun, shot her in the cheek, blew her jaw off, blood splattered everywhere.
[02:08:38.376 --> 02:08:39.156]  Oh, you're doubting me?
[02:08:39.176 --> 02:08:39.877]  Just Google that.
[02:08:40.584 --> 02:08:47.411]  And so they had another drill, and they killed Cop of the Year a few years ago in Fort Worth, shot him in the head during one of these drills.
[02:08:47.751 --> 02:08:50.494]  They even have loaded bullets, you know, live rounds sometimes.
[02:08:51.491 --> 02:08:54.733]  And just imagine them just running around screaming and yelling.
[02:08:54.773 --> 02:08:58.956]  We've seen it on the news, and the kids are crying, and they're splattering fake blood on them.
[02:08:59.597 --> 02:09:01.298]  The homeschoolers are going to kill you!
[02:09:01.398 --> 02:09:03.039]  The homeschoolers are going to kill you!
[02:09:03.239 --> 02:09:13.466]  Folks, that is like a thing with searchlights in an outdoor sports stadium, you know, in Mao Zedong's China with Mao loves you, Mao will keep you safe, Mao does it!
[02:09:13.826 --> 02:09:21.253]  You know, in public hangings, we're hanging this dissident because he wanted to cut the food rations from you and not feeding people for days and freaking them out.
[02:09:21.553 --> 02:09:23.014]  That's a re-education camp.
[02:09:23.135 --> 02:09:25.877]  You just totally give up and, I love you, let me lick your boots.
[02:09:26.698 --> 02:09:33.624]  Our government is running hardcore re-education camps all over the country in these drills.
[02:09:33.844 --> 02:09:40.070]  And you let your little darlings go to these degenerate drills where they splatter fake guts.
[02:09:40.590 --> 02:09:46.395]  And fake blood on them and tell them that militias and Christians and homeschoolers are going to kill them.
[02:09:48.937 --> 02:09:51.660]  Now, I talked about that in Road to Tyranny four years ago.
[02:09:52.581 --> 02:09:53.481]  Almost four years ago.
[02:09:53.521 --> 02:10:01.849]  People couldn't believe it when I showed the news articles, the documents, the training manuals, and FEMA saying all Christians are enemies of the government and terrorists, the Founding Fathers are terrorists.
[02:10:02.229 --> 02:10:03.530]  I have them in Kansas City saying it.
[02:10:03.810 --> 02:10:06.913]  And then it came out two and a half, three years later.
[02:10:08.043 --> 02:10:10.946]  Sure enough, they're doing drills, which I told you they were.
[02:10:11.026 --> 02:10:15.810]  We know about these, where they tell them that homeschoolers are going to kill them.
[02:10:17.291 --> 02:10:19.953]  Now, homeschoolers have the lowest level of criminal records.
[02:10:19.993 --> 02:10:21.314]  They have the highest test scores.
[02:10:21.354 --> 02:10:23.116]  They are fought over greedily.
[02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:25.661]  Above the best prep schools.
[02:10:26.062 --> 02:10:32.647]  Homeschoolers are fought over by, on average, by the big corporations.
[02:10:33.307 --> 02:10:36.430]  They win, on average, all of the major spelling bees.
[02:10:36.790 --> 02:10:38.432]  They've won like the last six years in a row.
[02:10:38.832 --> 02:10:40.033]  And the geography bees.
[02:10:40.673 --> 02:10:47.037]  And they're just good, decent, hard-working people that don't want their children to be destroyed in these public schools.
[02:10:47.318 --> 02:10:49.139]  So what do the feds do all over the country?
[02:10:49.159 --> 02:10:52.481]  They say, if you want Homeland Security funds, you've got to have this drill.
[02:10:52.541 --> 02:10:53.282]  Here's the manual.
[02:10:53.542 --> 02:10:56.704]  And that's what the sheriff was saying in that article last year in Michigan.
[02:10:57.344 --> 02:10:58.845]  He said, well, we want the federal funds.
[02:10:58.865 --> 02:11:00.366]  We've got to follow this script.
[02:11:00.827 --> 02:11:01.907]  We've got to follow this treatment.
[02:11:01.947 --> 02:11:05.450]  And they give them the equivalent of a play, like a Shakespearean play.
[02:11:05.470 --> 02:11:06.290]  And they follow that.
[02:11:06.691 --> 02:11:10.093]  And imagine these little kids, elementary, middle school kids,
[02:11:10.723 --> 02:11:12.104]  They practice blowing up buses.
[02:11:12.124 --> 02:11:13.846]  They pop smoke bombs on them.
[02:11:14.986 --> 02:11:18.309]  Well, you've seen it in Road to Tyranny where they actually blow cars up in downtown Belton.
[02:11:19.510 --> 02:11:21.371]  And this is all a re-education.
[02:11:21.431 --> 02:11:24.374]  Folks, we're under classical re-education.
[02:11:25.314 --> 02:11:31.880]  All I am is a good old boy from Texas that sees pretty clearly and got some street smarts and been studying this for a long time.
[02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:33.981]  Anybody could see that for what it is.
[02:11:34.361 --> 02:11:36.083]  Splattering fake blood on kids?
[02:11:37.063 --> 02:11:39.665]  All day long and telling them homeschoolers are going to kill them?
[02:11:39.845 --> 02:11:42.407]  Those kids are going to have nightmares about homeschoolers.
[02:11:43.468 --> 02:11:44.749]  They're demonizing it.
[02:11:45.870 --> 02:11:55.497]  And all over the country, CPS is grabbing homeschooler kids and they're trying under New Freedom Initiative saying they get to have CPS visits and Bill Clinton saying how bad it is and all this stuff.
[02:11:55.557 --> 02:11:59.621]  I mean, I don't mean to go off and do an insane rant, but I mean, this is insane.
[02:11:59.861 --> 02:12:00.861]  All of this is insane.
[02:12:01.462 --> 02:12:03.764]  We have entered a new level of weirdness.
[02:12:06.053 --> 02:12:10.135]  I mean, the city of Austin doesn't celebrate Texas Independence, but it celebrates D.C.
[02:12:10.175 --> 02:12:16.779]  State and openly promotes it, and UT will not allow Texas Independence Day.
[02:12:16.799 --> 02:12:17.360]  They banned it.
[02:12:17.380 --> 02:12:18.400]  What was it, 12 years ago?
[02:12:19.041 --> 02:12:20.601]  They just said, well, it could be racist.
[02:12:21.062 --> 02:12:22.282]  Because you said it is.
[02:12:22.383 --> 02:12:23.583]  Nobody ever said that.
[02:12:26.345 --> 02:12:28.826]  Again, let me just tell the Lorican Keys to something.
[02:12:30.447 --> 02:12:35.110]  Spain and France and all these different governments...
[02:12:37.265 --> 02:12:40.408]  Have control of Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico, other areas.
[02:12:41.869 --> 02:12:46.293]  Mexico itself was created out of indigenous populations' lands.
[02:12:47.373 --> 02:12:50.836]  Your country, Mexico, is just lines on a map.
[02:12:51.937 --> 02:12:53.338]  Just like the United States is.
[02:12:53.499 --> 02:12:56.061]  It's the Bill of Rights and the rights and the liberties we have here.
[02:12:56.341 --> 02:12:57.342]  That's what we're defending.
[02:12:57.562 --> 02:12:59.964]  That's why we're threatened by you saying this is Mexico.
[02:13:00.204 --> 02:13:02.366]  We're kickbacks in Mordito and there's no freedom.
[02:13:04.252 --> 02:13:11.958]  We're just lackadaisically got our arms wide open to you and then we're hearing the corporations fund you and telling you that you're going to take over and we're evil.
[02:13:12.258 --> 02:13:13.319]  And we're not going to put up with it.
[02:13:15.481 --> 02:13:16.702]  I mean, think of the insanity.
[02:13:17.342 --> 02:13:24.588]  There's going to be thousands of people marching tomorrow criticizing the Minutemen that simply go down to the border and report illegal aliens coming across.
[02:13:25.429 --> 02:13:26.830]  And they're calling them all these names.
[02:13:27.617 --> 02:13:34.182]  When in major polls, 67% of Hispanics are against the open borders, 87% of the American people on average.
[02:13:36.004 --> 02:13:39.347]  Again, it's a tiny minority telling us we're bad.
[02:13:39.367 --> 02:13:44.431]  80 plus percent are against the open borders, they push it.
[02:13:45.198 --> 02:13:47.841]  80 plus percent are against the National ID card, they pass it.
[02:13:48.461 --> 02:13:53.927]  80 plus percent are against different gun control measures, they still pass it.
[02:13:54.968 --> 02:14:00.493]  We're all against this, but there's these tiny groups that run around and get all the government power.
[02:14:00.913 --> 02:14:02.775]  We're not putting up with it.
[02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:06.720]  And again, folks, what is a re-education camp?
[02:14:06.740 --> 02:14:20.283]  They would put people in a sports stadium or in a warehouse and they'd flash lights on them and play propaganda films and torture people in plain view of everyone and play different groups off against each other until they'd really broken people down to see what they're dealing with.
[02:14:20.643 --> 02:14:24.344]  And then they start taking people out of the camp and using them as guards.
[02:14:24.544 --> 02:14:27.524]  Well, I was in here last week as one of you, but now I'm a guard.
[02:14:28.205 --> 02:14:30.065]  And they hit you with a billy club.
[02:14:30.862 --> 02:14:45.998]  I mean, it's more sophisticated to have the elementary students, you know, the eight-year-olds, get to school and tell them, all right, we're going to do a thing today for four hours outside, and you're all going to get a prize after you do this.
[02:14:46.058 --> 02:14:46.779]  Let's go out.
[02:14:47.319 --> 02:15:12.565]  And then all of a sudden these trucks pull up, and buses pull up, and hundreds of police get out, some of them in masks, and the others playing the part of terrorists and playing clothes in masks, and the little children are watching this, and these men are running around with machine guns, of course they've got the red corks on the end, and all of a sudden they're saying, alright kids, we're going to simulate you being killed, and they suddenly start putting red paint all over them, and fake guts, and fake arms, and fake legs, and the kids are going, what's
[02:15:12.665 --> 02:15:13.206]  What's going on?
[02:15:13.246 --> 02:15:13.887]  I want my mommy!
[02:15:13.907 --> 02:15:14.548]  I want my mommy!
[02:15:14.588 --> 02:15:15.069]  No, no!
[02:15:15.269 --> 02:15:15.709]  Get down!
[02:15:15.770 --> 02:15:16.190]  Roll later!
[02:15:16.230 --> 02:15:18.453]  Roll later!
[02:15:18.674 --> 02:15:21.217]  We are the homeschoolers against public education!
[02:15:21.237 --> 02:15:22.419]  Boom, boom, boom!
[02:15:22.459 --> 02:15:24.742]  You know, firecrackers going off!
[02:15:24.783 --> 02:15:25.524]  Children crying!
[02:15:27.627 --> 02:15:28.428]  Men in black masks!
[02:15:30.370 --> 02:15:37.436]  Just running around, who themselves have done a hundred drills of taking our guns and FEMA camping us, so now they think this is normal.
[02:15:37.516 --> 02:15:38.897]  Well, we saw what happened at Columbine.
[02:15:39.077 --> 02:15:41.439]  The next time this happens, we can't be able to deal with it.
[02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:47.665]  Yeah, we saw you sit outside for four hours and 15 minutes because the whole thing was federally engineered with feds inside shooting people.
[02:15:48.365 --> 02:15:50.607]  Totally documented, four-hour show to document it.
[02:15:50.767 --> 02:15:51.608]  We've done it in the past.
[02:15:52.029 --> 02:15:52.989]  I'm sick of you.
[02:15:53.430 --> 02:15:55.892]  Listen, I'm not the weirdo because I'm freaked out.
[02:15:56.713 --> 02:16:00.414]  By Senator Biden going, soon there'll be a move to forcibly implant everyone.
[02:16:00.634 --> 02:16:04.275]  How will you rule on the implantable chips and brain scanners?
[02:16:05.496 --> 02:16:07.556]  You know, we're living in the weirdness, folks.
[02:16:07.616 --> 02:16:08.696]  I'm not the one that did it.
[02:16:08.736 --> 02:16:12.458]  I'm not the weird one because I see it straight up and know what it is.
[02:16:14.058 --> 02:16:22.800]  Foreign Mexican troops, foreign Dutch armed troops, foreign Israeli troops confirmed in New Orleans, done confiscating, running around, foaming at the mouth.
[02:16:23.381 --> 02:16:24.581]  We've got just...
[02:16:25.325 --> 02:16:28.247]  Daisy Sace marching around going, This is Mexico!
[02:16:29.447 --> 02:16:31.148]  We've got just total bedlam.
[02:16:31.208 --> 02:16:32.829]  Cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[02:16:32.929 --> 02:16:34.130]  Mercury in the vaccines.
[02:16:34.650 --> 02:16:35.991]  Just total insanity.
[02:16:36.111 --> 02:16:46.336]  Bed rigging and scams and war profiteering and corruption and gay porn stars in the White House and gay porn stars being shipped into Bohemian Grove and just scams everywhere.
[02:16:46.416 --> 02:16:52.019]  Just thousands of the Chinese selling livers and organs and cosmetics of murdered...
[02:16:52.614 --> 02:16:54.116]  I'm telling you, man, it's hell itself!
[02:17:10.107 --> 02:17:16.252]  Just the level of depravity and twistedness and malevolence and just total, just out of control.
[02:17:16.532 --> 02:17:17.813]  And it's all coming down.
[02:17:18.113 --> 02:17:19.354]  It's all crystallizing.
[02:17:19.394 --> 02:17:20.555]  It's all getting worse.
[02:17:20.815 --> 02:17:22.316]  It's all intensifying.
[02:17:22.616 --> 02:17:24.378]  And you know people go, well, don't be so negative.
[02:17:24.398 --> 02:17:27.320]  How in the world am I not supposed to talk about this?
[02:17:27.380 --> 02:17:29.902]  It's not negative to tell you what's going on.
[02:17:30.442 --> 02:17:32.284]  We're under attack, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:17:32.304 --> 02:17:35.407]  This is an emergency wartime transmission worldwide.
[02:17:35.427 --> 02:17:36.988]  The United States is under attack.
[02:17:37.128 --> 02:17:39.050]  There's re-education camps everywhere.
[02:17:39.170 --> 02:17:40.691]  They're running fake terror drills.
[02:17:40.852 --> 02:17:42.333]  We're under total attack.
[02:17:42.353 --> 02:17:42.953]  Help us!
[02:17:43.074 --> 02:17:43.534]  Help us!
[02:17:43.554 --> 02:17:44.515]  We're under attack!
[02:17:46.075 --> 02:17:47.055]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:17:47.136 --> 02:17:51.918]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:17:52.078 --> 02:17:59.881]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:18:00.141 --> 02:18:05.504]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:18:05.724 --> 02:18:12.707]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:18:13.087 --> 02:18:13.707]  We're good to go.
[02:18:13.747 --> 02:18:13.947]  I think?
[02:18:31.594 --> 02:18:31.874]  We're good.
[02:18:45.678 --> 02:18:48.560]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:18:48.920 --> 02:18:51.783]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:18:52.023 --> 02:18:58.227]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[02:18:58.588 --> 02:19:05.913]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[02:19:06.093 --> 02:19:10.136]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[02:19:10.456 --> 02:19:15.978]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.

[02:20:45.609 --> 02:20:49.511]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[02:20:49.631 --> 02:20:51.391]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[02:20:51.451 --> 02:20:52.712]  But not just any water.
[02:20:52.792 --> 02:20:57.013]  You need electrolyzed iodized water or EO from RPA Biotech.
[02:20:57.073 --> 02:21:06.777]  Drinking EO water has been noted for its ability to flush toxins, attract and neutralize free radicals, enhance the delivery of nutrients, and most importantly, supports the immune system.
[02:21:06.937 --> 02:21:07.818]  We're good to go.

[02:21:54.802 --> 02:22:01.806]  Now, I was moved by that lady in the last hour crying about their plans to forcibly chip us, and now she's having nightmares about it.
[02:22:02.086 --> 02:22:04.568]  Look, that's the normal response to all of this, okay?
[02:22:04.908 --> 02:22:05.749]  None of us are safe.
[02:22:05.869 --> 02:22:06.709]  Our children aren't safe.
[02:22:07.189 --> 02:22:13.073]  We have a manifestly criminal government run by a bunch of mad scientists, folks, that see us as rodents.
[02:22:14.173 --> 02:22:15.114]  They just test on us.
[02:22:16.815 --> 02:22:18.816]  You know, our government didn't prosecute the Nazi scientists.
[02:22:18.836 --> 02:22:19.316]  They loved them.
[02:22:19.577 --> 02:22:20.877]  They hired them and brought them all over here.
[02:22:21.017 --> 02:22:22.898]  Because our government was doing the exact same type of stuff.
[02:22:23.199 --> 02:22:23.739]  You know, I got...
[02:22:24.381 --> 02:22:26.222]  It's in mainstream Israeli newspapers.
[02:22:26.242 --> 02:22:26.883]  It just came out.
[02:22:26.923 --> 02:22:28.964]  We already knew this, but now it's mainstream news in Israel.
[02:22:30.185 --> 02:22:31.445]  And I'm not even demonizing Israel.
[02:22:31.526 --> 02:22:32.606]  All these governments do it.
[02:22:32.686 --> 02:22:34.828]  Governments are evil, the founding fathers told us.
[02:22:36.389 --> 02:22:44.073]  There were 100,000 plus, but conservatively 100,000 Jewish children, mainly from Spain and other areas.
[02:22:45.674 --> 02:22:48.456]  And they were brought in in the 50s into Israel.
[02:22:50.586 --> 02:22:54.509]  And our government paid them $3 billion.
[02:22:55.309 --> 02:22:55.450]  U.S.
[02:22:55.470 --> 02:22:55.750]  government.
[02:22:56.790 --> 02:22:58.051]  Because it was a control group.
[02:22:59.392 --> 02:23:04.056]  To tell the parents that the public school was bringing them to have a ringworm treatment.
[02:23:04.536 --> 02:23:10.160]  Because some kids might get, quote, ringworm, which is a fungus that grows in a ring and makes your hair fall out.
[02:23:10.340 --> 02:23:10.860]  No big deal.
[02:23:12.261 --> 02:23:13.842]  You get it from having cats and stuff like that.
[02:23:13.862 --> 02:23:14.383]  They carry it.
[02:23:14.643 --> 02:23:15.464]  It's a fungus, folks.
[02:23:15.484 --> 02:23:16.144]  It grows in a ring.
[02:23:16.344 --> 02:23:17.185]  It's not a real worm.
[02:23:17.805 --> 02:23:20.127]  Ignoramuses, you know, 200 years ago thought that.
[02:23:21.164 --> 02:23:22.345]  They weren't ignorant, they just didn't know.
[02:23:43.607 --> 02:23:52.188]  With 3 to 10,000 times the safe level of radiation directly into their brains just to see what it would do.
[02:23:52.789 --> 02:24:01.470]  Our government callously, just because they wanted some data on radiation, radiated 100,000 Jewish children.
[02:24:02.730 --> 02:24:05.251]  And Israel took the money and did it.
[02:24:15.382 --> 02:24:22.524]  Now, that's in the mainstream newspapers in Israel.
[02:24:24.005 --> 02:24:26.066]  That's the type of people we're talking about.
[02:24:26.586 --> 02:24:29.267]  Stop being naive and stop being stupid.
[02:24:30.127 --> 02:24:35.289]  And the government people out there listening who know this is true, but, well, I'll just stay with the system and I'll be all right.
[02:24:35.709 --> 02:24:38.750]  Listen, you better stay in it, but you better work within it to make it better.
[02:24:39.430 --> 02:24:40.711]  And get your head out of the sand.
[02:24:41.251 --> 02:24:42.251]  Because let me tell you something.
[02:24:42.271 --> 02:24:44.192]  Everything I've been saying is true, and I wish it wasn't.
[02:24:45.313 --> 02:24:47.575]  So don't deny that they radiated the little kids.
[02:24:49.256 --> 02:24:50.236]  Go look it up.
[02:24:50.436 --> 02:24:52.238]  Research what I said before you deny it.
[02:24:52.258 --> 02:24:56.600]  Do you think you're safe when we've got a government that does stuff like that?
[02:24:56.620 --> 02:24:58.301]  Do you think you're safe for a minute?
[02:24:58.462 --> 02:25:01.944]  God only knows all the things the globalists have done to us.
[02:25:01.964 --> 02:25:03.585]  All right, I'm going to shut up.
[02:25:06.127 --> 02:25:07.788]  Betty in Florida, then Mike, Tim and others.
[02:25:07.828 --> 02:25:08.408]  Go ahead, Betty.
[02:25:09.189 --> 02:25:09.729]  Hey, Alex.
[02:25:10.716 --> 02:25:12.057]  I was calling for two reasons.
[02:25:12.677 --> 02:25:15.859]  One was to suggest a book to you and to the listeners.
[02:25:16.460 --> 02:25:26.466]  It's called Mugged by the State, and it's by Randall Fitzgerald, and it's a great book about eminent domain, even before the Supreme Court.
[02:25:26.526 --> 02:25:28.387]  Oh, they've already been stealing, exactly.
[02:25:29.027 --> 02:25:31.089]  Stealing property so much is disgusting.
[02:25:31.609 --> 02:25:38.173]  Well, it has numerous actual examples of how the government uses its regulations to
[02:25:38.985 --> 02:25:42.728]  Well, the big secret is they don't give you just compensation.
[02:25:43.408 --> 02:25:45.710]  The same group stealing your land values it.
[02:25:46.951 --> 02:25:51.955]  Well, it's also about how people have been put out of business and all kinds of examples.
[02:25:52.035 --> 02:25:58.340]  But also what's good about it is it gives you examples of organizations that will help you fight the litigation.
[02:25:58.760 --> 02:25:59.000]  Good.
[02:25:59.381 --> 02:26:00.982]  What else is on your mind?
[02:26:01.002 --> 02:26:08.688]  The other thing I was going to tell you, there was a program on last night on the History Channel on the 9-1-1 Commission Report.
[02:26:09.961 --> 02:26:11.401]  And I haven't seen the whole thing.
[02:26:11.441 --> 02:26:12.082]  I taped it.
[02:26:12.162 --> 02:26:24.204]  But one of the comments that was made, I think it was by Thomas Kane, was about that they had found three of the four-inch knives used by the hijackers.
[02:26:24.965 --> 02:26:27.405]  And I'm sitting there thinking... Yeah, and they found the passports.
[02:26:27.425 --> 02:26:27.565]  Yeah.
[02:26:27.625 --> 02:26:29.266]  It's a ridiculous bull.
[02:26:29.446 --> 02:26:30.626]  How is this possible?
[02:26:30.666 --> 02:26:32.406]  They brought down the buildings.
[02:26:32.466 --> 02:26:34.987]  It destroyed seven out of eight of the recorders.
[02:26:35.407 --> 02:26:38.809]  That were indestructible, but somehow they found four-inch knives.
[02:26:39.149 --> 02:26:43.911]  Oh, look, I mean, it came out today of the hundreds of examples of them destroying evidence.
[02:26:44.412 --> 02:26:49.274]  In 99, they said, take Muhammad out of the terror watch list because he was CIA, folks.
[02:26:49.294 --> 02:26:52.236]  I mean, I've had the embassy head on.
[02:26:52.256 --> 02:26:54.297]  I mean, it's not as though this is a secret.
[02:26:54.597 --> 02:26:55.978]  He thought it was part of a drill.
[02:26:57.599 --> 02:27:03.322]  Well, another thing they brought out was that they did a recreation of what happened in one of the...
[02:27:04.918 --> 02:27:05.838]  On one of the flights.
[02:27:06.278 --> 02:27:07.359]  Yeah, they're doing lots of that.
[02:27:07.379 --> 02:27:10.419]  They have to have that if they don't have any of the recordings.
[02:27:11.940 --> 02:27:15.301]  Well, they did have all the recordings, and they declared national security and destroyed them.
[02:27:15.661 --> 02:27:16.581]  They won't let us hear them.
[02:27:17.041 --> 02:27:18.181]  Well, I wonder why.
[02:27:18.201 --> 02:27:22.782]  I mean, why did they never release the video cameras of McVeigh bombing a building by himself?
[02:27:22.802 --> 02:27:25.363]  Because it was a bunch of Iraqis that worked for the U.S.
[02:27:25.403 --> 02:27:26.643]  government who even know their names.
[02:27:27.443 --> 02:27:29.084]  We'll be right back, folks.
[02:27:29.104 --> 02:27:29.544]  Stay with us.
[02:27:36.363 --> 02:27:37.304]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.765 --> 02:27:39.366]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.287 --> 02:27:43.130]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:52.220 --> 02:27:57.366]  One of America's greatest patriots, Patrick Henry, said, Give me liberty or give me death.
[02:27:58.357 --> 02:28:02.439]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution.
[02:28:02.900 --> 02:28:11.565]  Your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.

[02:30:52.290 --> 02:30:55.071]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:55.091 --> 02:31:05.775]  A few days ago, for the first hour, I played Don Henley's Inside Job, which is an amazing song talking about clearly government involvement in terrorism.
[02:31:06.815 --> 02:31:09.137]  The statement after statement is just amazing.
[02:31:09.157 --> 02:31:10.057]  We're going to play that.
[02:31:10.077 --> 02:31:13.300]  We're going to take some calls right now and then play that and cover some more news.
[02:31:13.560 --> 02:31:15.902]  Just two more calls while I have time for Mike and Tim.
[02:31:16.602 --> 02:31:17.323]  Mike in Arizona.
[02:31:17.363 --> 02:31:17.903]  Go ahead, Mike.
[02:31:18.163 --> 02:31:19.264]  Yes, good afternoon, Alex.
[02:31:19.584 --> 02:31:20.065]  How are you doing?
[02:31:20.345 --> 02:31:20.725]  I'm great.
[02:31:21.005 --> 02:31:24.668]  I'd like to talk a little bit about this Reconquista open border thing.
[02:31:25.148 --> 02:31:25.468]  Yes.
[02:31:25.969 --> 02:31:29.952]  And about a month ago or so, you had Ernie Hancock on.
[02:31:29.992 --> 02:31:34.635]  He was giving those reports from Crawford, Texas about Cindy Sheehan and all those things.
[02:31:35.345 --> 02:31:44.377]  And on the run-up to that, you introduced Ernie and you were talking about how he's a good freedom fighter and how he's for sealing the borders and everything like that.
[02:31:45.055 --> 02:31:51.997]  And I, for a fact, know that Ernie is a true libertarian, that he believes that there should be no open, or there should be no borders at all.
[02:31:52.017 --> 02:31:53.418]  Well, there's different types of libertarians.
[02:31:53.498 --> 02:31:55.558]  Ron Paul doesn't believe that borders should be open.
[02:31:56.079 --> 02:31:57.559]  Right, well, Ernie does.
[02:31:57.779 --> 02:31:59.400]  Well, I didn't know that, and so I did.
[02:31:59.760 --> 02:32:09.623]  Yes, well, I had called Ernie and I asked him about that, and he heard your statement, and he just said that, well, I don't have five minutes to explain it, why it is for...
[02:32:10.325 --> 02:32:11.045]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[02:32:27.594 --> 02:32:31.656]  Well, I mean, there shouldn't be welfare, period.
[02:32:31.816 --> 02:32:34.477]  You know, there shouldn't be welfare, period, if he's a real libertarian.
[02:32:34.857 --> 02:32:35.037]  Right.
[02:32:35.237 --> 02:32:36.237]  So what is that?
[02:32:36.277 --> 02:32:36.897]  That's not good.
[02:32:37.177 --> 02:32:39.238]  Look, I just had the guy on for reports from Crawford.
[02:32:39.418 --> 02:32:46.800]  I understand that, but it's one of those wolfs in sheep's clothing where he came on and he knew that the statements that you had made were not true.
[02:32:46.820 --> 02:32:51.862]  Yeah, well, I thought that because I've been out there in person around him going, then we've got to close the border, and he didn't say anything.
[02:32:51.882 --> 02:32:51.982]  Yes.
[02:32:52.202 --> 02:32:52.602]  Exactly.
[02:32:52.682 --> 02:32:53.723]  Oh, and one other thing, too.
[02:32:53.803 --> 02:33:04.712]  Our earlier caller, you were talking about Marie Conquista, and somebody had mentioned this, Christine Sinema, that was leading one of these marches in the Arizona Republic not that long ago.
[02:33:05.290 --> 02:33:11.493]  They did a bio on some of these people that were running for office, and she's openly admitted a lesbian.
[02:33:11.613 --> 02:33:16.616]  So just be careful of some of these people that you're associated with.
[02:33:16.896 --> 02:33:18.457]  I don't even know what that means.
[02:33:18.797 --> 02:33:21.519]  I don't even know the person's name you're talking about.
[02:33:21.999 --> 02:33:23.520]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[02:33:23.540 --> 02:33:26.101]  I just know... Who is this?
[02:33:26.722 --> 02:33:29.323]  It's somebody she ran for office with.
[02:33:29.403 --> 02:33:30.604]  And I'm associated with her.
[02:33:30.824 --> 02:33:31.744]  No, I didn't say this.
[02:33:32.104 --> 02:33:33.305]  An earlier caller...
[02:33:35.384 --> 02:33:37.405]  Okay, well, with Ernie specifically.
[02:33:37.425 --> 02:33:38.625]  Okay, well, thanks for the call.
[02:33:38.645 --> 02:33:39.886]  I really appreciate it.
[02:33:39.906 --> 02:33:41.427]  I heard exactly what you said, Bob.
[02:33:41.507 --> 02:33:41.587]  Okay?
[02:33:41.667 --> 02:33:42.207]  And it's pretty weird.
[02:34:05.915 --> 02:34:08.577]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tim in Florida.
[02:34:08.617 --> 02:34:09.318]  Tim, go ahead.
[02:34:10.098 --> 02:34:11.359]  Hey, Alex.
[02:34:11.900 --> 02:34:19.205]  This allergy that you've had... I went to Belcoderado the past two years.
[02:34:19.405 --> 02:34:20.025]  Do me a favor.
[02:34:20.045 --> 02:34:20.906]  Talk right into your phone.
[02:34:21.987 --> 02:34:23.227]  Oh, let me change my phone.
[02:34:24.228 --> 02:34:24.728]  Is that better?
[02:34:25.069 --> 02:34:26.410]  Yeah, that's a little better, yeah.
[02:34:26.590 --> 02:34:27.350]  I was on earpiece.
[02:34:27.630 --> 02:34:28.711]  Sorry.
[02:34:29.252 --> 02:34:30.913]  Anyway, I want to talk about the Rife machine.
[02:34:31.333 --> 02:34:32.494]  I have this Rife machine...
[02:34:33.231 --> 02:34:36.332]  By alternative technologies, bio solutions.
[02:34:36.752 --> 02:34:37.972]  You have a commercial about it.
[02:34:38.372 --> 02:34:40.213]  Well, sinusitis.
[02:34:41.233 --> 02:34:46.514]  When I was in Vail a couple years ago, I could do X and O's in the sky from the chemtrails.
[02:34:47.374 --> 02:34:51.395]  Well, I wasn't around any people the whole seven days I was there.
[02:34:53.535 --> 02:34:55.736]  Not one contact with a person.
[02:34:56.784 --> 02:35:02.130]  And the last two days I was there, I got badly sick.
[02:35:02.550 --> 02:35:04.713]  Sinus drainage, headaches.
[02:35:04.753 --> 02:35:10.599]  That doesn't, I mean, there are chemtrails, sir, but that doesn't mean that because you're up in the cold mountains, you get a cold.
[02:35:10.659 --> 02:35:11.580]  It was the chemtrails.
[02:35:12.401 --> 02:35:15.123]  Well, anyway, I got it again last year.
[02:35:15.264 --> 02:35:15.564]  Hold on.
[02:35:15.804 --> 02:35:19.328]  That isn't scientific to say because you see chemtrails, that's why you're sick.
[02:35:20.271 --> 02:35:23.533]  Okay, but what I'm saying is the sinusitis.
[02:35:23.933 --> 02:35:27.715]  There is a frequency on the rice machine for sinusitis.
[02:35:28.275 --> 02:35:36.319]  Well, I did that after going through cough drops full of aspartame, which I didn't look at the ingredients, sugar-free.
[02:35:37.480 --> 02:35:39.921]  After going through a bag of those, I'm still coughing.
[02:35:40.021 --> 02:35:42.142]  I could not talk from coughing so much.
[02:35:42.282 --> 02:35:44.663]  Anyway, I speak with Alternative Technologies.
[02:35:44.984 --> 02:35:47.965]  He's telling me about sinusitis and the frequency for that.
[02:35:48.305 --> 02:35:49.646]  Well, I put sticky pads...
[02:35:50.191 --> 02:35:51.412]  All right, thank you for the call, sir.
[02:35:51.432 --> 02:35:51.893]  I appreciate it.
[02:35:51.913 --> 02:35:58.940]  I'm going to tell you right now, just because you hear something sponsored here doesn't mean I agree with it.
[02:36:10.775 --> 02:36:28.602]  And whereas I'm sure that Royal Raymond Rife did invent some things, and I'm sure there are frequencies, and I know that there are things that can be done that do affect microbes in the body, I'm just not going to sit here and endorse something that I don't know the science behind it.
[02:36:29.083 --> 02:36:31.904]  And I don't know about the company you mentioned, but I know other companies and stuff.
[02:36:32.044 --> 02:36:37.306]  There's a thing going back to the 20s where there was a machine they'd sell you and it didn't have any parts or anything connected to it.
[02:36:38.386 --> 02:36:53.697]  But you weren't allowed to look inside of it either, or then you lost the quote rental of it, and it did this, and the science was saying, I don't believe the science, they say Prozac helps people, the science shows it actually kills them, makes them commit suicide, screws them up physically, not just mentally.
[02:36:54.037 --> 02:36:54.718]  Very toxic.
[02:36:55.318 --> 02:36:58.420]  I don't believe that fake science, and we go look at the studies and show it's a fraud.
[02:36:59.321 --> 02:37:07.787]  And I don't believe the people that sell magic pyramids, that people walk up and give me a pyramid and go, here, have this, this will give you power, I throw the thing in the trash can.
[02:37:09.523 --> 02:37:10.484]  I do not believe in that.
[02:37:11.104 --> 02:37:12.805]  Now, look, people, it's a free country.
[02:37:12.845 --> 02:37:14.686]  The network can take what sponsors they want.
[02:37:15.186 --> 02:37:17.428]  But I'm an honest person.
[02:37:17.468 --> 02:37:21.350]  If I don't believe in something or I'm not sure about it, I'm not going to talk about it.
[02:37:22.170 --> 02:37:27.373]  And I'm not going to get off into some big, long debate about rifle machines, folks.
[02:37:27.433 --> 02:37:28.553]  I mean, I'm just not going to do it.
[02:37:30.234 --> 02:37:33.256]  I've got friends I know that are really smart folks, and they swear by it.
[02:37:34.216 --> 02:37:36.998]  But, you know, beaming some frequency at yourself...
[02:37:38.929 --> 02:37:40.270]  I just don't have any comments on it.
[02:37:40.911 --> 02:37:47.356]  Listen, my broadcast... My broadcast is bizarre enough with just the stuff we can prove.
[02:37:49.537 --> 02:37:55.922]  And just because mainstream medicine has a lot of scams in it, doesn't mean that every alternative is real.
[02:37:57.383 --> 02:38:02.047]  And every time I say this, people scream bloody murder.
[02:38:02.827 --> 02:38:05.750]  People who make big money out of all this stuff scream bloody murder.
[02:38:06.790 --> 02:38:06.931]  And...
[02:38:09.907 --> 02:38:10.487]  I don't understand.
[02:38:10.527 --> 02:38:11.268]  It's a free country.
[02:38:11.328 --> 02:38:14.729]  I can have my views if I want them.
[02:38:14.869 --> 02:38:19.050]  I'm entitled to my views, and I've got my views, and those are my views.
[02:38:19.070 --> 02:38:21.351]  And I've said this about a hundred different issues.
[02:38:21.771 --> 02:38:24.052]  I'm not singling out any group or any particular person.
[02:38:24.072 --> 02:38:26.713]  It may work great.
[02:38:28.493 --> 02:38:29.114]  I just know this.
[02:38:29.154 --> 02:38:30.634]  There are a lot of scams out there.
[02:38:30.734 --> 02:38:35.776]  And it's not just with magic cures and things of that nature.
[02:38:36.747 --> 02:38:41.471]  That serious people tune into, and they hear it, and it just discredits us all, including the people that are doing that.
[02:38:48.456 --> 02:39:01.546]  What happens is, people get into the truth movement, they learn about the New World Order, and they get bored of the Federal Reserve, and they get bored of gun control, and they get bored of the open borders, and they get bored of all the stuff we can prove, and the move to forcibly make us take chips.
[02:39:02.225 --> 02:39:04.766]  And then they get off into all the weird stuff.
[02:39:04.906 --> 02:39:07.488]  Oh, I've graduated past all that, Alex.
[02:39:08.208 --> 02:39:09.169]  I've moved on.
[02:39:09.689 --> 02:39:11.610]  I've moved on to all the real stuff.
[02:39:12.270 --> 02:39:14.912]  I'm an adept now.
[02:39:15.032 --> 02:39:17.153]  I'm into the new age now.
[02:39:17.733 --> 02:39:19.274]  I've really figured it all out.
[02:39:19.334 --> 02:39:21.615]  And they're just off in la-la land.
[02:39:23.036 --> 02:39:23.997]  And I don't do that.
[02:39:24.057 --> 02:39:27.338]  I mean, it may sound crazier than you know what, that...
[02:39:30.265 --> 02:39:36.350]  That they do mind control things where they aim guns at kids and splatter fake blood on them and tell them that homeschoolers are going to kill them.
[02:39:36.390 --> 02:39:39.433]  I mean, that's grade A mind control.
[02:39:39.613 --> 02:39:40.254]  No debating it.
[02:39:41.094 --> 02:39:42.275]  Written up by psychiatrists.
[02:39:42.796 --> 02:39:44.437]  And they're doing it all over the country and you let them do it.
[02:39:44.677 --> 02:39:46.919]  I mean, that's crazier than a bed bug, what I just said.
[02:39:47.120 --> 02:39:47.600]  But you know what?
[02:39:47.620 --> 02:39:48.060]  They're doing it.
[02:39:50.002 --> 02:39:51.984]  They really are training the cops to take our guns.
[02:39:53.010 --> 02:39:55.871]  People have trouble believing it when I've got video of it.
[02:39:56.191 --> 02:40:04.593]  You know, I've been accused in Police State 2000 of hiring the USS Coronado, the next biggest ship to an aircraft carrier.
[02:40:06.133 --> 02:40:14.555]  I've been accused of hiring tens of thousands of foreign troops, helicopters, tanks, and hundreds of role players.
[02:40:15.215 --> 02:40:17.536]  I mean, that thing had to cost 50 million bucks.
[02:40:19.301 --> 02:40:28.283]  I have been accused of hiring all them because people see Marines training to take your guns and saying you're American citizens, and people can't believe it.
[02:40:28.303 --> 02:40:30.844]  I mean, they could say, Alex says he interviews Colonel Love.
[02:40:31.144 --> 02:40:32.324]  Let me call the Marine Corps.
[02:40:32.464 --> 02:40:34.344]  Is Colonel Love a real person?
[02:40:34.364 --> 02:40:35.125]  They could get on the phone.
[02:40:35.165 --> 02:40:37.365]  They could talk to Colonel Love's adjunct.
[02:40:38.285 --> 02:40:39.205]  They're not going to do that.
[02:40:39.265 --> 02:40:40.286]  They're going to say it isn't true.
[02:40:40.686 --> 02:40:43.846]  Fine, fine, fine, fine.
[02:40:43.866 --> 02:40:45.307]  I prove.
[02:40:45.327 --> 02:40:46.387]  I document.
[02:40:48.169 --> 02:40:51.211]  I mean, I've heard health claims, not by the right people.
[02:40:51.612 --> 02:40:53.193]  I mean, there may be something to that.
[02:40:53.233 --> 02:40:53.553]  I don't know.
[02:40:54.534 --> 02:40:55.715]  But by other people.
[02:40:57.256 --> 02:40:59.178]  You know, that are just patently ridiculous.
[02:41:00.118 --> 02:41:02.080]  You know, oh, get this Oregon generator.
[02:41:02.100 --> 02:41:02.981]  It's only 200 bucks.
[02:41:03.361 --> 02:41:06.383]  And this little pyramid with a wire sticking in your bathtub.
[02:41:06.463 --> 02:41:07.884]  It'll break up the chemtrails.
[02:41:07.924 --> 02:41:10.266]  I mean, this is just lunatic craziness.
[02:41:10.967 --> 02:41:12.468]  Total lunatic craziness.
[02:41:13.995 --> 02:41:17.897]  Everything alternative isn't true just because the government lies and cheats.
[02:41:19.477 --> 02:41:20.738]  See, there's a whole other area.
[02:41:20.758 --> 02:41:22.078]  There's a whole other paradigm to that.
[02:41:23.239 --> 02:41:23.979]  Tim in Florida.
[02:41:24.019 --> 02:41:24.639]  Go ahead, Tim.
[02:41:29.661 --> 02:41:30.661]  Okay, well, you know what?
[02:41:31.202 --> 02:41:31.542]  Pardon me?
[02:41:32.322 --> 02:41:33.903]  What did you just say?
[02:41:33.963 --> 02:41:35.143]  Okay, thank you for the information.
[02:41:35.163 --> 02:41:36.344]  Yeah, I'm not going to take any more calls now.
[02:41:36.744 --> 02:41:37.004]  Fine.
[02:41:37.024 --> 02:41:38.624]  It's been crazy all day with the calls anyways.
[02:41:41.775 --> 02:41:46.098]  You know, I may go crazy on the air and start yelling and screaming, but that is to make a point, folks.
[02:41:46.758 --> 02:41:48.539]  That's because that's the way I'm feeling about it.
[02:41:49.120 --> 02:41:54.924]  But, I mean, I come to the conclusion through slow, calculated study and deliberation.
[02:41:55.584 --> 02:41:56.925]  I'm very deliberative, actually.
[02:41:57.979 --> 02:41:59.940]  And I understand systems.
[02:42:00.181 --> 02:42:01.261]  And you can understand them too.
[02:42:01.301 --> 02:42:02.462]  This isn't hard to figure out.
[02:42:02.782 --> 02:42:04.203]  Government wants to dominate you.
[02:42:04.403 --> 02:42:12.248]  They've hired the best psychologists and sociologists and managers and PR artists to come up with a total mind control system.
[02:42:12.628 --> 02:42:13.869]  They brainwash the police.
[02:42:13.909 --> 02:42:15.150]  They brainwash the military.
[02:42:15.170 --> 02:42:16.270]  They brainwash the public.
[02:42:16.451 --> 02:42:18.232]  They're going to bring hell itself in, folks.
[02:42:19.452 --> 02:42:20.413]  And it's not going to be pretty.
[02:42:20.713 --> 02:42:23.235]  Let's play Don Henley, who I do agree with.
[02:42:23.315 --> 02:42:26.577]  It's an inside job, just like it always is.
[02:42:27.555 --> 02:42:32.618]  Listen to these quotes about how they know your mother's maiden name, they know you ate for breakfast.
[02:42:33.298 --> 02:42:36.900]  These quotes about how, you know, while we were asleep, they came, they took it all away.
[02:42:36.920 --> 02:42:38.821]  They're going to keep doing it, doing it, doing it.
[02:42:38.841 --> 02:42:42.422]  I mean, there's so many quotes talking about the government and an inside job.
[02:42:42.462 --> 02:42:43.163]  Here it is, folks.
[02:42:43.203 --> 02:42:43.803]  Beautiful song.
[02:42:45.044 --> 02:42:53.888]  Well, you were sleeping They came and took it all away
[02:42:58.684 --> 02:43:03.747]  We're good to go.
[02:43:03.867 --> 02:43:05.868]  We're good to go.
[02:43:30.058 --> 02:43:31.681]  We're good to go.
[02:43:50.791 --> 02:44:10.071]  This little island disappears While you are looking the other way They'll take your right to own your own ideas And it's an insane job
[02:44:11.431 --> 02:44:14.532]  We're good to go.
[02:44:58.285 --> 02:44:58.746]  Thanks for watching!
[02:45:19.537 --> 02:45:25.419]  I know, but after all, I am acquainted with the night.
[02:45:25.839 --> 02:45:31.542]  I know how hard it is to always walk out in the night.
[02:45:31.802 --> 02:45:37.144]  And it's an inside job to learn about forgiving.
[02:45:37.444 --> 02:45:40.065]  It's an inside job to hate.
[02:45:45.986 --> 02:45:51.753]  We're good to go.
[02:46:58.263 --> 02:47:01.045]  Unbelievable Don Henley, Inside Job album.
[02:47:02.566 --> 02:47:05.468]  And I tell you, he shows a deep knowledge of the New World War.
[02:47:05.529 --> 02:47:08.070]  He says, I know what I've done, looking the other way.
[02:47:08.090 --> 02:47:11.073]  You know, it's hard to walk in the light.
[02:47:11.113 --> 02:47:12.414]  It's painful to know the truth.
[02:47:13.034 --> 02:47:16.156]  You know, your little servants, you know, they didn't protect you.
[02:47:17.718 --> 02:47:19.299]  They know your mother's maiden name.
[02:47:19.319 --> 02:47:20.500]  They know what you had for breakfast.
[02:47:20.520 --> 02:47:22.121]  They know what's hidden under your mattress.
[02:47:23.777 --> 02:47:25.117]  And it was an inside job.
[02:47:25.177 --> 02:47:26.718]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[02:47:26.738 --> 02:47:28.859]  And the people that did it to the towers, they're going to do it.
[02:47:28.879 --> 02:47:29.459]  They're going to do it.
[02:47:29.479 --> 02:47:30.199]  They're going to keep doing it.
[02:47:30.219 --> 02:47:30.999]  They're going to do it.
[02:47:31.019 --> 02:47:32.520]  They're going to do it over and over again.
[02:47:32.540 --> 02:47:34.680]  I mean, just amazing.
[02:47:34.940 --> 02:47:36.441]  And there's so many other quotes.
[02:47:38.121 --> 02:47:43.143]  And he talks about what you did while you were dreaming, while you were sleeping, while you were looking the other way.
[02:47:43.163 --> 02:47:46.264]  I mean, looking the other way?
[02:47:47.284 --> 02:47:48.345]  Don't look the other way.
[02:47:48.365 --> 02:47:49.585]  Be down there tomorrow.
[02:47:51.525 --> 02:47:52.966]  3.30, south side of the Capitol.
[02:47:54.344 --> 02:47:56.725]  Right down by 11th and Congress, where those two streets meet.
[02:47:57.885 --> 02:48:10.169]  We'll be there, standing up against a federally funded La Reconquista by groups that openly say, for our race, everything, for others outside the race, nothing, and who call their organizations the race.
[02:48:11.429 --> 02:48:12.570]  We are not the racist.
[02:48:12.730 --> 02:48:16.231]  We are going to be standing up against the racist tomorrow.
[02:48:16.957 --> 02:48:18.517]  And this is not Mexico.
[02:48:18.577 --> 02:48:26.159]  And if you think it is, and you think the feds, you can team up with the dirty feds who want to destroy you and your families, you've got another thing coming.
[02:48:26.439 --> 02:48:26.979]  Join us.
[02:48:27.019 --> 02:48:28.239]  You know it's true in your guts.
[02:48:28.820 --> 02:48:33.801]  You know that your whole La Reconquista is an inside job of the same people that have always enslaved you.
[02:48:34.341 --> 02:48:37.821]  And if you buy the con again, you'll just give your children slavery again.
[02:48:38.422 --> 02:48:39.242]  Have some freedom.
[02:48:39.282 --> 02:48:39.922]  Join us.
[02:48:40.722 --> 02:48:41.522]  Join us now.
[02:48:42.462 --> 02:48:44.843]  There's an open hand, and then there'll be a clenched fist.
[02:48:46.855 --> 02:48:49.777]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:48:50.457 --> 02:48:51.738]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:48:51.958 --> 02:48:57.701]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:48:57.961 --> 02:49:03.184]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:49:03.504 --> 02:49:07.688]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:49:07.829 --> 02:49:11.612]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[02:49:11.873 --> 02:49:16.497]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:49:16.597 --> 02:49:22.864]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.904 --> 02:49:24.746]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:49:42.942 --> 02:49:45.004]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.

[02:49:59.119 --> 02:50:05.585]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[02:50:05.825 --> 02:50:07.086]  To below detectable levels.
[02:50:07.387 --> 02:50:11.310]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[02:50:11.550 --> 02:50:18.057]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:50:18.297 --> 02:50:23.762]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[02:50:24.002 --> 02:50:30.947]  The Berkey light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.

[02:50:37.811 --> 02:50:39.032]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[02:51:50.502 --> 02:51:52.723]  My friends, when is your levy going to break?
[02:51:52.783 --> 02:52:09.311]  When is your brain going to give in to the truth and admit that we have a criminally insane elite all around us, that it's gotten this bad because we've been decadent, we've had so much plenty, that our entire civilization, our children are in danger, grave danger.
[02:52:10.320 --> 02:52:10.861]  We're good to go.
[02:52:32.873 --> 02:52:39.022]  I'll throw myself in a meat grinder instantly if I thought it would protect the meek and the weak and the innocent.
[02:52:39.142 --> 02:52:40.164]  Our job as men...
[02:52:40.925 --> 02:52:45.466]  Defend our women, defend our countries, defend our villages.
[02:52:45.966 --> 02:53:08.833]  And if you don't understand that scientifically crafted war machines have been turned loose on us, and that we're giving them one hell of a fight back, and if you don't realize that God's on our side, and that you can see the conditioning, you can see the control, you can decide to pick an area of the enemy to attack in the info war, just don't whine and don't talk about the size of it, just attack it.
[02:53:09.353 --> 02:53:10.574]  Attack it.
[02:53:10.594 --> 02:53:11.474]  Be like fire ants.
[02:53:11.494 --> 02:53:12.574]  Just bite into it.
[02:53:12.895 --> 02:53:14.155]  And stick your stinger in there.
[02:53:14.175 --> 02:53:16.336]  And just keep biting and biting and biting.
[02:53:17.216 --> 02:53:18.237]  We can overwhelm them.
[02:53:18.257 --> 02:53:19.357]  We can bring them down.
[02:53:20.358 --> 02:53:23.119]  And love and encourage and honor is the tool that will do it.
[02:53:24.819 --> 02:53:27.200]  And you can't really look to a lot of the so-called patriot movement.
[02:53:27.220 --> 02:53:34.463]  It's been totally infiltrated with scum and profiteers and racists and backstabbers and controllers.
[02:53:35.223 --> 02:53:36.004]  There's a lot of good people.
[02:53:36.024 --> 02:53:37.724]  There's also a lot of really bad people.
[02:53:37.765 --> 02:53:38.865]  And just use some discernment
[02:53:39.924 --> 02:53:42.445]  And support those that tell the truth.
[02:53:42.465 --> 02:53:44.205]  Support those that fight the New World Order.
[02:53:45.385 --> 02:53:48.126]  And realize that this is a movement of humanity.
[02:53:48.146 --> 02:53:52.627]  This is an organic movement of good people standing up against evil.
[02:53:52.667 --> 02:53:53.868]  Stop looking for leaders.
[02:53:53.908 --> 02:53:54.968]  Leaders can be bought off.
[02:53:55.208 --> 02:53:56.008]  They can be killed.
[02:53:56.048 --> 02:53:56.948]  They can be controlled.
[02:53:57.168 --> 02:53:58.229]  They can be compromised.
[02:53:58.349 --> 02:53:59.569]  You know you're good.
[02:54:00.109 --> 02:54:01.730]  You know that you're not sold out.
[02:54:01.830 --> 02:54:02.830]  You know you're a leader.
[02:54:02.890 --> 02:54:04.270]  You know what you think is important.
[02:54:04.750 --> 02:54:05.791]  God's talking to you.
[02:54:05.971 --> 02:54:06.831]  You take action.
[02:54:07.412 --> 02:54:09.454]  That's what I'm here for, is to get you to move.
[02:54:10.014 --> 02:54:10.395]  Okay?
[02:54:10.915 --> 02:54:12.096]  That's where the power lays.
[02:54:13.077 --> 02:54:15.800]  And then when you start taking action, have discernment.
[02:54:15.840 --> 02:54:17.541]  Don't be, you know, suckered.
[02:54:17.581 --> 02:54:22.806]  What happens is I wake people up, and then parasite carpetbaggers come down here and feed off the whole thing.
[02:54:23.867 --> 02:54:26.610]  It's just a sad thing to see it, and I have to admit it to myself.
[02:54:27.150 --> 02:54:33.116]  There's a lot of things I've done that have fought the New World Order, and there's other things I've done that have been siphoned off for bad.
[02:54:33.959 --> 02:54:36.361]  And I want to thank all those that have gotten my documentaries.
[02:54:36.641 --> 02:54:37.282]  They're pretty good.
[02:54:37.322 --> 02:54:40.264]  They wake a lot of people up with the best tools we've found yet.
[02:54:40.345 --> 02:54:47.931]  I hope you'll get Martial Law and Road to Tyranny and Masters of Terror and Matrix of Evil and all the other great books and videos I cover.
[02:54:48.031 --> 02:54:51.214]  And I hope you'll get them and make copies of them and get them out to people.
[02:54:52.275 --> 02:54:55.898]  Infowars.com or sign up for 15 cents a day.
[02:54:56.739 --> 02:55:01.723]  If you support us, we'll get even more people in there and better equipment and do a better job.
[02:55:02.697 --> 02:55:13.086]  They go to prisonplanet.tv, 15 cents a day, monthly and yearly subscriptions, and see all the films and all the material, or call toll-free to get the films, 1-888-253-3139.
[02:55:14.687 --> 02:55:16.629]  That's a big part of the solution.
[02:55:17.029 --> 02:55:21.012]  Now, the globalists could blow my head off two weeks from now, but these videos will live on.
[02:55:21.913 --> 02:55:26.217]  My great frustration is I've got about ten films I want to make, films that are better than anything I've ever made.
[02:55:26.237 --> 02:55:27.798]  It's just the time, the energy, the money.
[02:55:28.667 --> 02:55:30.488]  So many ideas I want to push forward.
[02:55:30.508 --> 02:55:32.109]  So many things I want to put together.
[02:55:32.910 --> 02:55:34.791]  So many fights I want to engage in.
[02:55:35.151 --> 02:55:40.094]  But I know you'll carry on regardless of whether I'm here 10 years from now or 50 years from now.
[02:55:40.374 --> 02:55:41.855]  The human spirit beats on.
[02:55:42.435 --> 02:55:46.138]  We stand on the shoulders of all those that sacrificed before us.
[02:55:46.198 --> 02:55:48.239]  Those that gave it up for their progeny.
[02:55:48.659 --> 02:55:50.719]  And I have that same instinctive drive.
[02:55:50.739 --> 02:55:53.520]  And I know you can activate that drive in yourself.
[02:55:53.620 --> 02:55:54.980]  And we are unstoppable.
[02:55:55.300 --> 02:55:57.141]  We're going to smash the New World Order.
[02:55:57.201 --> 02:55:59.621]  We're going to take down their systems and their standards.
[02:55:59.901 --> 02:56:03.782]  We're going to punish the jury of their peers, their leaders.
[02:56:04.322 --> 02:56:05.923]  And the cycle will start over again.
[02:56:06.003 --> 02:56:07.643]  Evil will creep back in slowly.
[02:56:08.003 --> 02:56:09.383]  And then we'll become decadent again.
[02:56:09.423 --> 02:56:12.104]  And it will all start over again until the good Lord comes back.
[02:56:13.084 --> 02:56:15.125]  This is the fight for all the marbles.
[02:56:15.546 --> 02:56:18.127]  You can tell that the season is nigh, and we are here.
[02:56:18.427 --> 02:56:19.628]  We are at the crossroads.
[02:56:19.708 --> 02:56:23.330]  Engage the enemy for humanity, for life, for your families!
