[00:00:05.625 --> 00:00:06.265]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.926 --> 00:00:08.007]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.707 --> 00:00:09.848]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:11.290]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:12.891]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.592 --> 00:00:17.555]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.776 --> 00:00:21.859]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:34.631]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:35.432 --> 00:00:37.434]  It is Wednesday, November 2nd, 2005.
[00:00:38.916 --> 00:00:42.300]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and I'm in my new studio.
[00:00:43.288 --> 00:00:44.649]  Probably sound a little bit different.
[00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:57.160]  I actually have some equipment that's just above Tinker Toy level, whereas my old setup was, well I wouldn't say amateurish, but now we've invested a little bit more and actually getting my voice across to you.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:05.927]  And I'm sitting here looking out the front window onto the street here in Austin, Texas, in what will soon be my open to the public bookstore.
[00:01:06.559 --> 00:01:16.872]  But I'm not about to announce the address of my bookstore yet because we are still setting the place up and making sure it's real nice for the public right here in Austin, Texas.
[00:01:17.193 --> 00:01:17.874]  So I love this.
[00:01:17.894 --> 00:01:19.756]  This is a hometown-y feel.
[00:01:20.337 --> 00:01:24.843]  I'm just here on a nice little average street, little business street, little retail area.
[00:01:25.772 --> 00:01:26.353]  I don't think so.
[00:01:41.374 --> 00:01:43.896]  Now isn't that exciting top news?
[00:01:44.236 --> 00:01:45.737]  You have tuned in to hear that.
[00:01:46.217 --> 00:01:53.241]  But I've been doing my broadcast out of the same little studio in my house for, what, seven years.
[00:01:53.782 --> 00:01:56.343]  And before that doing it out of KJFK FM.
[00:01:58.264 --> 00:01:58.524]  I think so.
[00:02:14.091 --> 00:02:15.952]  You know, in-studio interviews around the country.
[00:02:16.372 --> 00:02:20.013]  But it is certainly something new here.
[00:02:20.053 --> 00:02:25.595]  It's like I've gotten on a new bicycle after riding the same bicycle for seven plus years.
[00:02:26.155 --> 00:02:30.357]  Vehicle bomb kills 20 south of Baghdad.
[00:02:30.377 --> 00:02:31.057]  Two U.S.
[00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:39.780]  pilots killed in Iraq helicopter crash the Super Cobra or AH-1W Super Cobra attack helicopter.
[00:02:40.755 --> 00:02:44.936]  went down and there have been a bunch of other bombings and shootings and killings.
[00:02:44.996 --> 00:02:46.417]  I wonder who's behind it?
[00:02:46.457 --> 00:02:49.557]  I wonder, is it British SAS dressed up like Arabs?
[00:02:49.617 --> 00:02:51.658]  Or is it Israelis dressed up like Arabs?
[00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:55.219]  Or is it our own CIA dressed up like Arabs when we've caught them all doing it?
[00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:57.360]  Is that what's happening this time?
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.581]  Feds to release details of their flu fight plan.
[00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:03.001]  They've already told us some of it.
[00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:05.402]  Massive martial law control.
[00:03:05.442 --> 00:03:07.682]  We'll be getting into that story.
[00:03:08.182 --> 00:03:09.863]  Also, Senate Democrats
[00:03:10.363 --> 00:03:10.724]  Yes, we are.
[00:03:29.954 --> 00:03:36.901]  By bringing forward the point that we were lied to about WMDs, and we were promised answers about this, and we haven't gotten it.
[00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:43.207]  So I want to play a little news clip and analyze some of the propaganda in the clip a little bit later in this hour.
[00:03:43.568 --> 00:03:49.774]  Also, there's a little piece concerning Tiananmen Square, and it's not the anniversary of Tiananmen Square, but I think it's important to remember
[00:03:50.634 --> 00:03:54.457]  That human beings over in China are standing up and are resisting.
[00:03:54.757 --> 00:03:56.939]  We've got a lot of students listening in China.
[00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.523]  This is just a shout out to all of them that, you know, don't buy this phony reform garbage.
[00:04:03.103 --> 00:04:15.332]  As you know, if you were to look at the facts, your government is getting more and more corrupt, more and more out of control, and that's why it's a darling, a client state of this corrupt global government controlled by these crony capitalists who are not free market.
[00:04:16.418 --> 00:04:19.119]  Violent clashes at Mexican border double.
[00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:27.322]  And that's just the number of dead federal officers, state officers, county officers, local officers.
[00:04:28.102 --> 00:04:36.784]  As we reported two months ago, I haven't seen the latest numbers yet in the last two months on just the general numbers of dead, but it's over 600.
[00:04:36.945 --> 00:04:37.925]  Over 600, yeah.
[00:04:38.325 --> 00:04:41.426]  Just in this one area of Texas and the Mexican border.
[00:04:41.726 --> 00:04:44.607]  But now we do have some new numbers on the numbers of dead cops.
[00:04:45.328 --> 00:04:46.349]  And it's doubled.
[00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:47.090]  Yes.
[00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:48.871]  Massive crisis.
[00:04:49.492 --> 00:04:52.855]  Asia-Pacific nations to stage a mock flu outbreak.
[00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:53.596]  We'll get into that.
[00:04:54.116 --> 00:04:56.478]  And so much more today.
[00:04:56.858 --> 00:04:57.679]  You don't want to miss it.
[00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:58.940]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:59.461]  Check it out.
[00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.311]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.571 --> 00:05:07.152]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.493 --> 00:05:12.156]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.496 --> 00:05:16.939]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:21.542]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.763 --> 00:05:22.363]  The Constitution
[00:05:22.363 --> 00:05:22.943]  We're good to go.

[00:06:01.474 --> 00:06:04.956]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.
[00:06:05.236 --> 00:06:08.737]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:06:08.817 --> 00:06:12.779]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:19.141]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:19.562 --> 00:06:27.465]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:06:27.865 --> 00:06:33.229]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:06:33.369 --> 00:06:37.152]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:37.512 --> 00:06:39.354]  And the Black Berkey Filters are recleanable.
[00:06:39.434 --> 00:06:41.596]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:06:41.836 --> 00:06:46.499]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.

[00:07:00.467 --> 00:07:03.849]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[00:07:04.089 --> 00:07:04.429]  Why?
[00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:07.391]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[00:07:07.471 --> 00:07:12.414]  Cardivite drops and capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.
[00:07:12.534 --> 00:07:22.260]  The all-natural ingredients in cardivite begin immediately working to increase metabolism in your heart muscle tissue, mitigating heart rhythm abnormalities, and improving oxygen and blood flow in the heart.

[00:08:02.435 --> 00:08:08.460]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.081 --> 00:08:12.103]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.748 --> 00:08:20.850]  It is Wednesday, November 2nd, 2005.
[00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:22.732]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:24.774]  We're here live Monday through Friday.
[00:08:25.675 --> 00:08:26.735]  From 11 a.m.
[00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:28.056]  until 2 p.m.
[00:08:28.196 --> 00:08:33.617]  Central Standard Time and then back of course live from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:08:34.037 --> 00:08:47.882]  Coming up in the second hour we're going to have a huge news blitz update on the scores of different stories from Paul Joseph Watson, the editor over at PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:08:47.962 --> 00:08:49.062]  He'll be joining us
[00:08:49.922 --> 00:08:53.045]  And we're also going to have wide open phones throughout the day.
[00:08:53.726 --> 00:08:57.590]  Yesterday, at the end of the broadcast, the last 10 minutes, I kind of threw a fit.
[00:08:59.055 --> 00:09:03.098]  On air of sorts, and so I apologize for that.
[00:09:03.318 --> 00:09:15.645]  For many of you that were listening, you may not even have noticed, but I consider it a loss of control, which I would imagine many of you know seems to be routine, but it isn't really.
[00:09:15.665 --> 00:09:24.090]  A caller called in who'd been holding for 45 minutes, and he griped and complained that he'd been holding too long, saying he'd been holding for an hour and a half.
[00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:25.251]  He'd been holding for 45 minutes.
[00:09:26.032 --> 00:09:28.113]  We know because I'm down here in Austin, Texas.
[00:09:29.393 --> 00:09:34.517]  And the network, the satellite uplinks the folks running the show, are up in Minnesota.
[00:09:34.977 --> 00:09:43.062]  And so when the call comes in and they put it on the computer, you know, the first name, where they're calling from for me, it shows the time that name was put there.
[00:09:43.923 --> 00:09:45.384]  And it was 45 minutes he was holding.
[00:09:45.404 --> 00:09:46.064]  But that doesn't matter.
[00:09:46.104 --> 00:09:47.345]  That is a long time to hold.
[00:09:47.893 --> 00:09:55.500]  Though, if you call in on something like, say, Coast to Coast AM or Rush Limbaugh, if you're even able to get in, you might be holding an hour or two.
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.462]  So, it's not my fault, folks.
[00:09:57.502 --> 00:10:03.268]  I mean, we normally load the phone lines by the time the show even starts, and we don't screen phone calls.
[00:10:03.368 --> 00:10:05.630]  We don't censor people.
[00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:12.897]  And so, it does get out of control, though, that the phones are loaded, in many cases, before the broadcast even starts.
[00:10:13.517 --> 00:10:16.800]  But in fairness to Wyatt from Maryland, I was a little bit mean to him.
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.021]  He said, I've been holding for an hour and a half.
[00:10:18.041 --> 00:10:18.802]  And I said, I'm sorry.
[00:10:19.443 --> 00:10:21.544]  And then he kept saying, well I've been holding too long.
[00:10:21.765 --> 00:10:22.605]  And then I said, that's it.
[00:10:23.046 --> 00:10:24.007]  I'm hanging up on you.
[00:10:24.347 --> 00:10:27.209]  I'm not taking any more phone calls here in the last segment.
[00:10:29.438 --> 00:10:31.860]  Again, I didn't mean to try to punish other people that were holding.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.661]  It was that I was actually frustrated.
[00:10:34.222 --> 00:10:52.156]  Believe me, I've got all this news I want to cover and every news article I could go into all this detail and show all these connections and different directions and different avenues and give people the actual nuts and bolts down at the microscopic level of how this New World Order operates.
[00:10:52.216 --> 00:10:55.298]  I mean, I could take one or two of the articles I have today in front of me
[00:10:56.625 --> 00:11:00.106]  And I could talk all day about just one of these stories.
[00:11:01.367 --> 00:11:02.427]  It would be quite easy.
[00:11:03.507 --> 00:11:06.028]  But I just don't have the time.
[00:11:06.188 --> 00:11:09.509]  And plus, I like to go down rabbit trails.
[00:11:09.549 --> 00:11:14.931]  I like to, you know, I start talking about some basic thing and then I run down a million different other little avenues.
[00:11:15.191 --> 00:11:16.892]  And so I do want to take your calls.
[00:11:17.942 --> 00:11:20.004]  But at the same time, I want to have guests on.
[00:11:20.525 --> 00:11:25.089]  And I want to be able to go over the news myself and take my time.
[00:11:25.989 --> 00:11:28.532]  So some days we take calls, other days we don't.
[00:11:28.612 --> 00:11:30.093]  Some days we take nothing but calls.
[00:11:30.433 --> 00:11:31.975]  Other days we cover nothing but news.
[00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:34.797]  There's been many times where I just don't take a single call.
[00:11:34.897 --> 00:11:36.899]  I just talk and cover news for three hours.
[00:11:36.959 --> 00:11:43.685]  And a lot of people, I think some of you might be surprised to know, the majority of the emails I get commenting on program format
[00:11:44.645 --> 00:11:48.248]  Which seems to be pretty helter-skelter at times are, yeah, don't take calls.
[00:11:48.328 --> 00:11:49.869]  Just cover news and have guests on.
[00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:51.571]  Just get into analysis.
[00:11:52.451 --> 00:11:54.132]  But frankly, I like calls.
[00:11:54.293 --> 00:11:56.114]  I like the directions you take us in.
[00:11:56.614 --> 00:11:57.835]  I like the points you make.
[00:11:57.935 --> 00:12:05.341]  I like it when you disagree with me, because that makes for good radio and brings out a lot of different facets that never would have been discussed.
[00:12:05.981 --> 00:12:10.364]  But I do apologize to Wyatt, who's been a listener for almost a decade.
[00:12:13.283 --> 00:12:16.145]  And I've been a friend of the show actually, sent us a lot of good material.
[00:12:16.205 --> 00:12:25.170]  So, if Wyatt's out there listening in Maryland, I'm sorry Wyatt, but you know, when I did apologize one time, you didn't have to rub it in, so you might need to apologize a little bit.
[00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:32.514]  Now again, that seems like a petty issue to be covering, but I feel like, not a fish out of water, I just feel strange.
[00:12:33.034 --> 00:12:38.577]  Seven years in the same studio, and I'm in a new studio, looking out
[00:12:40.038 --> 00:13:01.362]  On a beautiful blue sky and just beautiful green trees and a bird sitting over there in a bush about 20 yards from me and I am just enamored with it because I've been in this little studio in my house for seven years with the window boarded up with soundproofing and I just said, you know, so what?
[00:13:01.442 --> 00:13:04.923]  I'm going to have a window, a little bit of sound comes in occasionally.
[00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:05.843]  Who cares?
[00:13:05.883 --> 00:13:07.123]  The rest of this room is soundproofed.
[00:13:07.703 --> 00:13:10.444]  And so you may occasionally hear a dog barking.
[00:13:10.964 --> 00:13:23.429]  You may occasionally hear ambulance sirens or police sirens as they cook past us, but that will add to the new front porch quality of this broadcast.
[00:13:23.489 --> 00:13:28.331]  But again, that's not why you tuned in to hear endless analysis of what I'm looking at out the window.
[00:13:29.551 --> 00:13:30.131]  It's weird.
[00:13:31.452 --> 00:13:34.433]  Australia receives threat of terror attack
[00:13:35.706 --> 00:13:48.429]  This is out of the Associated Press and our comment on this is what a coincidence as the government is getting vilified for trying to pass anti-terror legislation that would lock up anti-war protesters for seven years for their speech.
[00:13:48.989 --> 00:13:49.569]  That's public.
[00:13:50.249 --> 00:13:51.909]  That's not our spin, folks.
[00:13:51.929 --> 00:13:52.870]  That's not our analysis.
[00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.790]  That's admitted.
[00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:58.871]  That would lock up anti-war protesters for seven years amongst other travesties.
[00:13:58.931 --> 00:13:59.711]  Oh, there's so many.
[00:14:00.611 --> 00:14:04.132]  Our Al-Qaeda friends issue a useful threat
[00:14:04.821 --> 00:14:10.144]  With the government uses to make its case and threaten the Australian people.
[00:14:10.484 --> 00:14:11.465]  Same thing in Britain.
[00:14:11.565 --> 00:14:12.846]  Same tactic everywhere.
[00:14:13.466 --> 00:14:16.368]  I mean Saddam Hussein comes out and says, I am not with Al-Qaeda.
[00:14:16.408 --> 00:14:18.869]  I've been fighting them since I worked with the West.
[00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:20.830]  We don't want them here.
[00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:21.931]  We've hunted them down.
[00:14:22.011 --> 00:14:23.372]  It's all lies.
[00:14:24.132 --> 00:14:26.234]  And suddenly Bin Laden releases a videotape.
[00:14:26.414 --> 00:14:27.494]  No, no, I'm with Saddam.
[00:14:27.534 --> 00:14:28.015]  No, no, no.
[00:14:28.055 --> 00:14:29.235]  Colin Powell is telling the truth.
[00:14:29.556 --> 00:14:31.657]  I'm with Saddam.
[00:14:32.752 --> 00:14:33.833]  And Powell screwed up.
[00:14:33.853 --> 00:14:42.799]  He goes before the Senate Armed Services Committee and goes, right now on Al Jazeera TV, they're airing the latest Bin Laden tape where he agrees with us and says he works with Saddam.
[00:14:43.119 --> 00:14:47.823]  And all the reporters literally have the video of it run out of the room because they hadn't heard this, this new tape.
[00:14:48.223 --> 00:14:50.605]  And they come back five minutes later, there's no tape on Al Jazeera.
[00:14:50.925 --> 00:14:53.006]  Oh well, they'll be getting it then within a few hours.
[00:14:54.167 --> 00:14:55.728]  And literally he turned red.
[00:14:57.029 --> 00:14:58.350]  He literally got flushed.
[00:14:59.154 --> 00:15:00.135]  Colin Powell did.
[00:15:00.155 --> 00:15:09.863]  This is how ridiculous it is, and over and over again, right when Tony Blair is in trouble, about to be removed from office in a special election, boom, Al Qaeda strikes!
[00:15:10.203 --> 00:15:16.448]  Then it turns out that SWAT is the top MI6 asset, and they're protecting him, carrying out the bombings.
[00:15:16.748 --> 00:15:26.396]  Witnesses, including police and firefighters and people on board the trains, say there were bombs under it with giant holes blown up through it, but they hang big sheets all over it and cover it
[00:15:26.836 --> 00:15:29.818]  And tell everybody to shut up and haul off the trains and the bus.
[00:15:30.918 --> 00:15:32.839]  Same MO over and again.
[00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:33.840]  Here's the problem.
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:35.801]  You're listening for the first time.
[00:15:35.821 --> 00:15:36.701]  You don't believe this.
[00:15:37.182 --> 00:15:40.283]  I could give you dozens and dozens of examples right now.
[00:15:40.363 --> 00:15:50.369]  I could just stop the presses, cancel Paul Watson coming on, take no phone calls, and talk a hundred miles an hour, because I'd have to to cover them all, for the next three hours.
[00:15:51.050 --> 00:16:05.946]  Just to cover all the admitted, documented instances of our government and other governments carrying out terror attacks, burning their own buildings, bombing, killing as a pretext to scare the population into acquiescing to their police state demands.
[00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:08.210]  I could do it right now.
[00:16:08.731 --> 00:16:09.791]  I mean, here's another example.
[00:16:10.291 --> 00:16:17.353]  Of course, I put in my film three years ago, The Masters of Terror, a section about the Gulf of Tonkin never happening, and the admissions that the U.S.
[00:16:17.393 --> 00:16:24.096]  government actually attacked Vietnam, and they were smart enough not to fire back, and then they just made it up that our ships had been attacked.
[00:16:24.596 --> 00:16:31.318]  Because we had admirals, we had captains, we had people on the destroyers who'd been in major newspapers 35, 40 years ago.
[00:16:32.099 --> 00:16:33.239]  I mean, right after it happened.
[00:16:36.272 --> 00:16:37.793]  People were in the news talking about it.
[00:16:38.493 --> 00:16:41.335]  And then, two years ago, the LBJ tape comes out.
[00:16:41.695 --> 00:16:47.939]  Three different tapes of him saying, we staged it, and talking to McNamara on the phone about how to use it to get the war going.
[00:16:49.459 --> 00:16:56.563]  Well, they wouldn't fire at us, sir, but we were attacking them up in that river area, and they wouldn't shoot back, but the press has gotten a hold of it.
[00:16:56.583 --> 00:16:57.484]  We're just going to tell them that
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.322]  We're just going to tell them they attacked us.
[00:17:00.703 --> 00:17:01.644]  This is what you tell the press.
[00:17:01.844 --> 00:17:02.925]  Alright, I'll deal with it.
[00:17:03.166 --> 00:17:04.287]  I mean, I talked about this yesterday.
[00:17:04.327 --> 00:17:05.969]  Well, now it's in the Associated Press.
[00:17:05.989 --> 00:17:06.530]  It's everywhere.
[00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:07.230]  Confirmed.
[00:17:07.511 --> 00:17:09.253]  CIA documents declassified.
[00:17:09.493 --> 00:17:11.215]  That, yes, it was totally staged.
[00:17:11.435 --> 00:17:13.217]  So now we have the CIA's own documents.
[00:17:13.377 --> 00:17:15.540]  We have McNamara and the President on take three times.
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:16.481]  We have the admirals.
[00:17:16.501 --> 00:17:17.162]  We have the captains.
[00:17:17.182 --> 00:17:19.064]  We have the sailors on the ship.
[00:17:20.689 --> 00:17:23.290]  We have them all telling you, and there's still people denying it.
[00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:28.671]  So see, I could talk hours about Gopher Duncan, and you'll say, well nobody got killed in that.
[00:17:28.731 --> 00:17:30.811]  I mean, they just staged it.
[00:17:30.991 --> 00:17:35.452]  58,000 Americans did get killed in that process.
[00:17:35.772 --> 00:17:38.093]  And I, for one, am sick and tired of it.
[00:17:38.993 --> 00:17:46.255]  So there is one article covered, and not even properly, but folks, they are passing laws where if you're protesting they can shoot you and kill you.
[00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:48.515]  If your quote are being disruptive.
[00:17:49.914 --> 00:17:53.016]  Just click on our archive of it on PrisonPlanet.com, RoomForWars.com.
[00:17:53.336 --> 00:17:54.056]  It is legion.
[00:17:54.456 --> 00:18:01.019]  They're passing laws over there where if you criticize the government or say that you're against a war, you are arrested for websites.
[00:18:01.119 --> 00:18:04.041]  They've already started arresting people by the way, even before the law passed.
[00:18:04.081 --> 00:18:04.801]  That's the tactic.
[00:18:05.141 --> 00:18:07.182]  They start doing it and then try to pass the law.
[00:18:07.222 --> 00:18:09.843]  It's like Patriot Act 2 has been in force for three years.
[00:18:11.524 --> 00:18:12.484]  But they've never passed it.
[00:18:14.265 --> 00:18:16.086]  So this is the type of stuff we're talking about.
[00:18:17.167 --> 00:18:20.578]  Australia is even worse than the US now.
[00:18:21.267 --> 00:18:22.228]  Even worse than England.
[00:18:22.288 --> 00:18:34.075]  I mean, they are openly declaring communist Chinese-type powers, Soviet-era-type powers, Nazi-type, Stasi-type, Cuban-type.
[00:18:34.455 --> 00:18:36.937]  I mean, this is just unprecedented.
[00:18:37.217 --> 00:18:47.664]  And right on time, as their Prime Minister is in trouble, Mr. Howard, right on time, as they're calling to remove him, there's a big revolt, bin Laden pops up, I'm gonna hit Australia.
[00:18:48.164 --> 00:18:50.305]  And now they're running and screaming in fear.
[00:18:50.345 --> 00:18:51.585]  We'll be hit in a minute.
[00:18:51.945 --> 00:18:54.186]  Give us the laws, oh help us.
[00:18:54.566 --> 00:18:56.727]  Oh, you don't want to pass martial law provisions.
[00:18:57.007 --> 00:19:00.468]  Oh, in America, bird flu is going to hit you any minute.
[00:19:00.928 --> 00:19:01.528]  And guess what?
[00:19:01.788 --> 00:19:03.889]  They're going to have big attack drills now.
[00:19:05.118 --> 00:19:11.341]  Over there, in Australia, with the Chinese government and others, where they're hit by the bird flu.
[00:19:11.381 --> 00:19:14.323]  And oh, martial law is needed for that too.
[00:19:14.703 --> 00:19:20.506]  There's just Bush announcing it the same day Howard's announcing it the same day they're announcing it in England.
[00:19:20.926 --> 00:19:31.611]  Asia-Pacific nations to stage mock outbreaks and practice taking over the local governments and how to deal with all the problems and how to take care of everything.
[00:19:32.191 --> 00:19:35.353]  Why, it's just absolutely wonderful.
[00:19:37.215 --> 00:19:37.735]  Look at this.
[00:19:37.815 --> 00:19:40.977]  Four inoculations beginning of Bush's bird flu plan.
[00:19:41.138 --> 00:19:42.919]  I'll give you the latest on the bird flu when we get back.
[00:19:43.679 --> 00:19:45.801]  And we'll get into all these new dead U.S.
[00:19:45.821 --> 00:19:48.203]  troops and helicopters getting blown out of the sky.
[00:19:48.263 --> 00:19:50.884]  All the ATF's in trouble.
[00:19:50.904 --> 00:19:51.585]  Some good news.
[00:19:51.605 --> 00:19:52.686]  Some luscious news.
[00:19:53.406 --> 00:19:59.971]  And just so much more as I come to you from my Central Texas Command Center, my friends.
[00:20:01.537 --> 00:20:05.440]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:17.948]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:20:18.368 --> 00:20:18.769]  The U.S.
[00:20:18.809 --> 00:20:24.392]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:20:24.792 --> 00:20:26.994]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:20:28.855 --> 00:20:29.916]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:20:29.956 --> 00:20:32.798]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:20:32.918 --> 00:20:38.941]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:20:39.362 --> 00:20:42.724]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[00:20:42.804 --> 00:20:49.148]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[00:20:49.708 --> 00:20:53.710]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.

[00:20:56.791 --> 00:20:57.591]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:58.852 --> 00:21:03.133]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:21:03.253 --> 00:21:07.355]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:21:07.495 --> 00:21:10.376]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:21:10.456 --> 00:21:17.119]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:21:17.219 --> 00:21:17.279]  Yes.
[00:21:17.339 --> 00:21:20.342]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:21:20.543 --> 00:21:22.925]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:21:23.085 --> 00:21:33.216]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as atrazine, benzene, chloride and chloroform.
[00:21:33.416 --> 00:21:42.542]  MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.

[00:22:06.285 --> 00:22:08.966]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:22:09.426 --> 00:22:12.086]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?

[00:23:05.637 --> 00:23:07.378]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[00:23:07.458 --> 00:23:08.699]  But not just any water.

[00:24:25.079 --> 00:24:26.399]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:26.819 --> 00:24:28.480]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:35.902]  We do have Paul Joseph Watson joining us in the second hour of the Huge News Blitz, where we'll cover a whole bunch of different important subjects.
[00:24:37.243 --> 00:24:40.304]  Now understand, when I say this, Ron Paul is on record.
[00:24:40.404 --> 00:24:44.645]  I didn't know what Congressman Ron Paul was going to say when I had him on two weeks ago.
[00:24:45.065 --> 00:24:46.546]  But he said what everybody else is saying.
[00:24:46.986 --> 00:24:49.267]  From Ray McGovern to
[00:24:50.427 --> 00:25:03.359]  Scott Ritter, to Andres Vamulo, German Defense Minister, to Michael Meacher, British high-level member of the Cabinet who resigned from Blair's Cabinet on the eve of the Gulf War II.
[00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:11.786]  They're saying all the same things, but I had Ron Paul on, and many of you heard it, we re-aired it, it was so important, and I said, what do you think this bird flu is all about?
[00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:22.496]  And he said, well, I think they're preparing to use it for martial law and the smokescreen for the feds to take over the entire government and confiscate our firearms.
[00:25:24.057 --> 00:25:26.058]  Now, that's exactly what I've been saying.
[00:25:26.518 --> 00:25:35.123]  Not because I'm some genius, not even because Ron Paul, the medical doctor, Vietnam veteran, in Vietnam for three years, folks, something else, volunteering.
[00:25:37.839 --> 00:25:39.361]  Most conservative member of Congress.
[00:25:39.381 --> 00:25:40.742]  Don't ever forget that voting record.
[00:25:40.782 --> 00:25:42.764]  That's the facts, not the rhetoric.
[00:25:44.125 --> 00:25:44.745]  All of this.
[00:25:46.447 --> 00:25:47.348]  All of this happening.
[00:25:48.228 --> 00:25:49.269]  All of this developing.
[00:25:50.731 --> 00:25:50.951]  So...
[00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:54.453]  When we talk about this, this is really going on.
[00:25:54.513 --> 00:25:56.736]  They really are federalizing our local cities.
[00:25:56.976 --> 00:25:58.698]  They really are federalizing our police.
[00:25:58.878 --> 00:26:05.747]  They really are preparing for forced inoculations and military roundups and military lockdowns of major cities and gun confiscation.
[00:26:06.208 --> 00:26:11.214]  I remember talking to state police officers that were somewhat high-level, that's all I'll tell you, three years ago.
[00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:19.196]  I'm getting the same intel from sheriff's deputies in Louisiana and in New York, upstate New York, getting the same MO.
[00:26:19.536 --> 00:26:22.858]  Yeah, we've been called into FEMA meetings that we're not allowed to videotape, Alex.
[00:26:23.479 --> 00:26:33.707]  And we've been told that there's going to be a biological outbreak and we've got to confiscate the guns because you can't have the people being armed during a quarantine because that would cause riots.
[00:26:33.787 --> 00:26:35.929]  Everybody knows it's guns in New Orleans.
[00:26:36.389 --> 00:26:37.269]  Guns and the L.A.
[00:26:37.309 --> 00:26:38.430]  riots in the early 90s.
[00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:46.933]  Guns over and over again that have contained riots when the cops can't or won't do something about it or where they stand down.
[00:26:46.993 --> 00:26:54.055]  Where Mr. Gates, Chief Gates, told them to stand down because he wasn't going to, you know, quote, lose his men on a pack of criminals.
[00:26:54.275 --> 00:26:55.836]  Well, what about defending the citizenry?
[00:26:56.196 --> 00:26:57.216]  Oh, but that's not your job.
[00:26:57.276 --> 00:26:57.776]  I forgot.
[00:26:58.036 --> 00:26:59.917]  You've said you don't have any liability to do that.
[00:27:01.588 --> 00:27:24.962]  So, they really are gearing up, and so you can count on your government, if there's any type of emergency, a 9.2 earthquake in LA, which would destroy the city, or whether it's a tidal wave, or whether it's a meteor, or whether it's the bird flu, or whether it's a Al-Cieda nuke going off in Chicago, or Big D, Dallas,
[00:27:25.602 --> 00:27:30.725]  You can count on them locking your city down, moving in sector by sector, and taking your guns.
[00:27:31.345 --> 00:27:33.486]  You can count on them breaking you and your family up.
[00:27:34.306 --> 00:27:36.107]  You can count on them doing that.
[00:27:37.468 --> 00:27:49.394]  The top experts, the scientists, the people that study mass movement of populations, they have publicly said that bullets don't do anything to stop an outbreak.
[00:27:50.299 --> 00:27:56.762]  And that 98% of the funding has been for bullets, not for pills, not for doctors, not for treatment.
[00:27:57.522 --> 00:27:58.863]  And then you look at bird flu itself.
[00:27:59.203 --> 00:28:05.625]  The top scientists, the top doctor in the government in Canada saying it's a hoax, it's a fraud, it's totally blown out of proportion.
[00:28:05.885 --> 00:28:09.427]  The top scientists, the top doctors in Spain, Russia.
[00:28:09.807 --> 00:28:11.908]  But we've got our government with Donald Rumsfeld,
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:13.321]  More articles.
[00:28:13.361 --> 00:28:14.502]  Yesterday it was Fortune.
[00:28:14.982 --> 00:28:17.664]  Today it's Reuters, CNN, you name it.
[00:28:18.145 --> 00:28:18.865]  I mean, look at this.
[00:28:18.945 --> 00:28:21.147]  Rumsfeld profits from bird flu scare.
[00:28:21.467 --> 00:28:22.608]  We told you this a month ago.
[00:28:23.609 --> 00:28:25.251]  Bill Starkey told you this a month ago.
[00:28:25.691 --> 00:28:27.813]  So did Mr. Rappaport.
[00:28:28.293 --> 00:28:33.938]  A year ago, Tamiflu was known, if at all, as one obscure remedy for Lymphalangia.
[00:28:34.711 --> 00:28:39.673]  Influenja, I'm inventing words now, which doctors typically treat with bed rest and chicken soup.
[00:28:39.693 --> 00:28:48.897]  Today, with panic mounting over the potential bird flu pandemic, it's the most sought after drug in the world, as everyone from suburban soccer moms in the U.S.
[00:28:49.137 --> 00:28:53.719]  to health officials in London and Taipei scramble to stockpile the pill.
[00:28:54.179 --> 00:29:00.102]  At the moment, it seems virtually the entire world is on sick chicken alert.
[00:29:01.932 --> 00:29:05.938]  And it goes on to report that Rumsfeld is going to make
[00:29:07.742 --> 00:29:13.367]  Tens of millions of dollars, and that George Shultz is going to make tens of millions of dollars.
[00:29:13.387 --> 00:29:14.548]  I mean, these are the numbers.
[00:29:15.289 --> 00:29:17.451]  $35 million for this administration official.
[00:29:17.711 --> 00:29:19.232]  $47 million for that administration official.
[00:29:19.813 --> 00:29:21.374]  $7 million for this official.
[00:29:21.955 --> 00:29:23.977]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on.
[00:29:24.217 --> 00:29:34.166]  All these top Bilderberg Group members, all these top elitists, I mean, they are cashing in on this Gilead company owned by Roche.
[00:29:35.038 --> 00:29:36.419]  It goes on and on.
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:37.641]  It's so obvious.
[00:29:38.161 --> 00:29:40.783]  And they all made money off the scare with the SARS.
[00:29:41.204 --> 00:29:42.925]  They always make money off of it.
[00:29:43.226 --> 00:29:45.668]  But we'll tell you more about it when we get back after some calls.
[00:29:46.128 --> 00:29:47.129]  Tons of news coming up.
[00:29:47.169 --> 00:29:50.172]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.794 --> 00:29:52.694]  We're on the march.

[00:29:55.697 --> 00:29:58.380]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.903 --> 00:30:02.263]  I think so.
[00:30:22.551 --> 00:30:23.952]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[00:30:24.112 --> 00:30:27.573]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[00:30:27.854 --> 00:30:31.635]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[00:30:31.896 --> 00:30:36.858]  Whatever it is you seek, Zangle could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.

[00:30:39.099 --> 00:30:43.082]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[00:30:43.322 --> 00:30:45.183]  Dango is what you are looking for.

[00:31:18.743 --> 00:31:22.965]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:31:23.246 --> 00:31:27.168]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[00:31:27.408 --> 00:31:33.932]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.

[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.903]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:32:04.143 --> 00:32:07.987]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:32:08.308 --> 00:32:09.128]  Read the labels.
[00:32:09.569 --> 00:32:13.693]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:32:13.914 --> 00:32:18.098]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:32:18.479 --> 00:32:23.344]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.

[00:33:02.232 --> 00:33:07.356]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:08.056 --> 00:33:10.298]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:29.144 --> 00:33:30.444]  Alright, we're back live.
[00:33:30.504 --> 00:33:32.025]  I'm here in my new studio.
[00:33:32.565 --> 00:33:33.005]  I love it.
[00:33:33.225 --> 00:33:34.725]  Still got some more soundproofing to do.
[00:33:35.705 --> 00:33:37.586]  Gotta test these things out live on air, though.
[00:33:38.206 --> 00:33:39.426]  So it'll just get better and better.
[00:33:39.486 --> 00:33:42.347]  Thank you so much for joining us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:43.167 --> 00:33:47.848]  I'm gonna get back into all the new stuff that's happened with the bird flu.
[00:33:48.786 --> 00:33:52.547]  Asia-Pacific nations to stage a mock terror outbreak, just like England and the US are.
[00:33:52.607 --> 00:33:56.389]  These are all federal martial law takeover drills.
[00:33:56.709 --> 00:33:59.410]  Bush was going to say that he wanted $1.7 billion.
[00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:00.950]  Now it's $7 billion.
[00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:04.671]  He needs $7 billion more to hand out to his administration officials.
[00:34:05.412 --> 00:34:05.832]  Literally.
[00:34:06.772 --> 00:34:14.054]  And at the same time, we have this bill that's passed the Senate and is now in the House, S. 1873,
[00:34:16.187 --> 00:34:18.168]  That does several draconian things.
[00:34:18.428 --> 00:34:28.252]  Forced inoculations that was already codified and a major stepping stone passed for forced inoculations, page 76 of Homeland Security.
[00:34:28.292 --> 00:34:32.354]  They tried to pass the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act.
[00:34:33.254 --> 00:34:34.095]  at the state levels.
[00:34:34.155 --> 00:34:35.695]  That failed in most states.
[00:34:36.236 --> 00:34:45.820]  When people learn the details of it, forced quarantines, roundups, when medical workers and police and firefighters found out, first responders found out, they'd have to take it.
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:48.141]  It just, it died in its tracks.
[00:34:48.621 --> 00:34:50.021]  So they just passed it federally.
[00:34:50.081 --> 00:34:51.182]  But now, S-1873 gives incredible detail
[00:34:56.676 --> 00:34:58.117]  It gives us a close-up view.
[00:34:58.197 --> 00:35:02.600]  It fills in the gray areas with how they're actually going to carry this out.
[00:35:04.081 --> 00:35:20.591]  And it also has a bunch of different sections about quarantines, not just forced inoculations, the funding mechanisms to do this, and then the biggest thing is that it gives total liability protection, period, to the entire industry.
[00:35:21.251 --> 00:35:22.732]  Gives them total carte blanche.
[00:35:23.596 --> 00:35:31.239]  Imagine, the industry goes and lobbies to force the public to take their product and then they get liability protection on top of it.
[00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:49.748]  That'd be like if gun makers said, you are going to have to own 15 guns, you're going to have to leave them unlocked, laying around your house with children, and if anybody gets their head blown off, you're not going to have any liability.
[00:35:49.808 --> 00:35:50.628]  That is the gun maker.
[00:35:51.522 --> 00:35:52.743]  You're going, Alex, well what do you mean?
[00:35:52.803 --> 00:35:54.845]  You said gun makers shouldn't have any liability.
[00:35:54.885 --> 00:35:58.009]  Yes, the gun makers don't make you buy their guns.
[00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:06.917]  Just like Louisville Slugger doesn't make you buy their baseball bat, or just like a knife maker doesn't make you buy, say, a Puma knife made in Germany.
[00:36:07.498 --> 00:36:15.246]  If somebody murders someone using that knife or that baseball bat or that gun, or if somebody has an accident with that gun and it didn't happen because of
[00:36:15.939 --> 00:36:17.279]  The product being defective.
[00:36:17.319 --> 00:36:24.282]  I mean, sure, if a gun blows up in your face and it's brand new and you were using the wrong ammo, the gun makers are still liable and they should be.
[00:36:24.782 --> 00:36:35.025]  But if some killer robs your house, steals your shotgun, and goes on a killing spree, you're not liable and the gun maker, Winchester, isn't liable.
[00:36:36.062 --> 00:36:38.404]  So, this is really, really dangerous.
[00:36:38.424 --> 00:36:47.012]  This gives them total liability protection as the government moves to make more and more of these vaccines mandatory and to force the public to take these.
[00:36:47.492 --> 00:36:57.821]  And they've even told the police, okay, well we need people all over the nation to come and train to run quarantines and to engage in forced inoculations of the population.
[00:36:59.059 --> 00:37:01.820]  And you don't even have to take it as a first responder.
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.301]  We just want you to force others to take it.
[00:37:04.701 --> 00:37:07.942]  How can you morally, as police officers, do that?
[00:37:08.522 --> 00:37:11.123]  And I'm here to report that most cops are just saying, you know what?
[00:37:11.503 --> 00:37:12.503]  I don't want that duty.
[00:37:12.763 --> 00:37:15.544]  You know, I don't care if I'm going to get double pay to go to this training.
[00:37:15.844 --> 00:37:17.705]  I don't care if I get some federal bonus.
[00:37:17.985 --> 00:37:23.647]  I don't care if I get some federal 10 badge, you know, where I'm an auxiliary federal marshal deputy.
[00:37:24.327 --> 00:37:25.989]  Firefighters are saying the same thing.
[00:37:26.349 --> 00:37:27.711]  And so I do commend you.
[00:37:27.731 --> 00:37:31.735]  You know, we bash the police a lot here because they get away with so much.
[00:37:31.795 --> 00:37:33.156]  The bad cops get away with so much.
[00:37:33.397 --> 00:37:35.198]  We think bad cops should be punished.
[00:37:35.579 --> 00:37:38.662]  But there are a lot of good police and they're saying no to this system.
[00:37:38.942 --> 00:37:40.704]  And so for that, we've got to commend you.
[00:37:40.744 --> 00:37:41.945]  And so I do commend you.
[00:37:42.946 --> 00:37:45.529]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Arizona.
[00:37:46.009 --> 00:37:46.990]  John, you're on the air.
[00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.371]  Go ahead.
[00:37:49.659 --> 00:37:50.339]  Well, that wasn't good.
[00:37:50.459 --> 00:37:51.039]  Oh, how you doing?
[00:37:51.079 --> 00:37:51.560]  I'm sorry.
[00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:52.740]  That's okay.
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:53.120]  Go ahead.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:56.281]  Alex, I've been trying to get a hold of you for a while.
[00:37:57.182 --> 00:37:58.882]  I'm actually Mexican-American.
[00:37:59.002 --> 00:38:07.425]  I've been on your website listening to some of them things you had, you know, like about September the 16th, how you were bullhorning them.
[00:38:07.705 --> 00:38:09.686]  I was actually brought up with my grandfather.
[00:38:09.726 --> 00:38:12.687]  He was part of the Brown Berets way back then.
[00:38:12.747 --> 00:38:16.448]  I actually knew about the plant of San Diego as I was a kid.
[00:38:17.028 --> 00:38:19.089]  But I just wanted to call and say,
[00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:22.972]  Thank you for being so truthful and doing the things you're doing.
[00:38:24.133 --> 00:38:27.635]  Just all the time and effort you put in, it's taken away from your family.
[00:38:28.055 --> 00:38:36.000]  I've learned more about what's going on in this world by subscribing to your website and even by history than I did in school.
[00:38:36.621 --> 00:38:39.664]  So I just wanted to tell you, not everybody who was Hispanic against you.
[00:38:39.704 --> 00:38:40.525]  I just wanted to thank you.
[00:38:54.418 --> 00:38:56.860]  You know, Hispanics are 13% of the population.
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:00.161]  Well, why are 30% of my video orders Hispanics?
[00:39:00.341 --> 00:39:08.426]  Hispanics resonate with my message, and I've said this more than any other group, more than white people, more than black folks.
[00:39:08.966 --> 00:39:09.587]  I know that.
[00:39:10.667 --> 00:39:14.890]  That's what hurt my feelings when I called up this local group and the guy was saying all this racist stuff to me.
[00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:16.911]  I said, well, I got a lot of my friends are Hispanic.
[00:39:16.931 --> 00:39:18.792]  He goes, oh, that's what you all say.
[00:39:18.872 --> 00:39:19.593]  That's racist.
[00:39:19.613 --> 00:39:20.893]  And I go, no, it isn't racist.
[00:39:21.174 --> 00:39:23.335]  But I'm telling you that I don't dislike Hispanics.
[00:39:23.435 --> 00:39:24.335]  I like Hispanics.
[00:39:24.676 --> 00:39:26.917]  And so don't try to sit here and say this to me.
[00:39:26.957 --> 00:39:31.680]  And look, when Paul Harvey says killing the natives is good and black slaves are good,
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:33.400]  He's an old, evil white guy.
[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:34.441]  I come out and expose him.
[00:39:34.661 --> 00:39:37.722]  When this black professor says kill all the whites, I come out and expose him.
[00:39:37.962 --> 00:39:40.822]  When George Bush is tied in with Nazis, I come out and expose him.
[00:39:41.203 --> 00:39:44.143]  And I appreciate you, sir, understanding that.
[00:39:44.203 --> 00:39:49.965]  No, no, it's a minority of radical Hispanics, just like it's a minority of radical whites and radical blacks,
[00:39:50.325 --> 00:39:56.187]  And we track the funding back to the very same big foundations that want us all at each other's throats.
[00:39:56.427 --> 00:40:00.488]  And so I commend you, sir, and Hispanics in general for seeing through this.
[00:40:00.888 --> 00:40:10.391]  I'm just sick of seeing the media act like that this whole La Raza Mecha movement, La Reconquista, is the view of Hispanics.
[00:40:10.771 --> 00:40:16.953]  When Hispanics win more Purple Hearts and more Congressional Medal of Honors and more Marine Corps stickers on
[00:40:17.193 --> 00:40:18.953]  You know, Hispanics cars I've seen anywhere else.
[00:40:19.173 --> 00:40:21.734]  You know, Hispanics are wonderful, patriotic, good people.
[00:40:22.034 --> 00:40:25.935]  And the New World Order is trying to sell you on not being patriotic.
[00:40:26.215 --> 00:40:27.656]  And it's not going to work, my friend.
[00:40:28.216 --> 00:40:28.716]  Exactly.
[00:40:28.736 --> 00:40:33.777]  You know, more people would, I think, if they just thought the truth instead of listening to everybody.
[00:40:33.797 --> 00:40:37.738]  And, you know, and like you, you're actually doing a great job about that.
[00:40:38.078 --> 00:40:42.839]  And I'm very sorry that some people don't agree with you, but you do have a Hispanic friend here in Phoenix, sir.
[00:40:42.859 --> 00:40:44.200]  I just want to let you know that.
[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:45.520]  And if you're in my neck of the woods,
[00:40:46.018 --> 00:40:49.620]  It would be a pleasure and honor to make you a Mexican dinner.
[00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:52.521]  Well, we got lots of good Mexican dinner around here.
[00:40:52.561 --> 00:40:54.722]  Believe me, half of it is on my waistline right now.
[00:40:54.742 --> 00:40:55.702]  That's my favorite food.
[00:40:56.482 --> 00:41:05.266]  But go back for me, for those that don't know what the plan of San Diego is, why don't you tell people, you said I believe your grandfather was a Brown Beret.
[00:41:05.286 --> 00:41:06.146]  Tell folks about that.
[00:41:06.407 --> 00:41:08.567]  Right, he was heavily involved with it.
[00:41:08.848 --> 00:41:14.570]  I was about ten years old, I'm in my fifties now, but it was actually a plan and they used to discuss it there at his house.
[00:41:15.208 --> 00:41:29.337]  About taking all the area back that they believed was taken away by a white man and they were actually planning, like you said, to kill everybody from the age of 60 and up, males, so they wouldn't be able to repopulate.
[00:41:30.845 --> 00:41:34.467]  And that is just pure Adolf Hitler behavior.
[00:41:35.007 --> 00:41:36.809]  Exactly.
[00:41:36.969 --> 00:41:48.575]  You know what, I bet if I met your grandfather, who I'm sure is dead now, I bet if I actually had an hour to talk with him, if I could get in a time machine, teleport back to him, I bet you a million dollars I could wake him up because
[00:41:49.856 --> 00:41:52.418]  It's just like that black professor saying kill all whites.
[00:41:53.279 --> 00:41:54.800]  90% of what he said was true.
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:56.961]  He said they're planning to kill the black people.
[00:41:57.161 --> 00:41:59.023]  They're enslaving us, our kids, with Ritalin.
[00:41:59.223 --> 00:42:01.004]  They're retina scanning us like slaves.
[00:42:01.204 --> 00:42:03.186]  The whole world's being turned into a prison.
[00:42:03.566 --> 00:42:06.148]  The only thing he got wrong was, it's evil people.
[00:42:06.728 --> 00:42:08.810]  More white kids are on Ritalin than anybody else.
[00:42:09.371 --> 00:42:11.733]  White kids are taking the vaccines full of the poisons.
[00:42:12.073 --> 00:42:13.275]  We're all under attack.
[00:42:13.615 --> 00:42:17.218]  So I'm sure that your grandfather saw how Hispanics were being treated wrong.
[00:42:17.259 --> 00:42:20.001]  There was a lot of racism against Hispanics then and still is.
[00:42:20.442 --> 00:42:21.703]  I'm sure he understood.
[00:42:22.521 --> 00:42:25.942]  How there's been a program exterminating Native Americans.
[00:42:26.242 --> 00:42:30.803]  The exact same thing that sickos like Paul Harvey says is great.
[00:42:30.904 --> 00:42:33.424]  Using biological warfare on natives is great.
[00:42:33.744 --> 00:42:38.686]  So see, just because some group wanted to kill your grandfather, he said, you know what, we're going to kill you.
[00:42:39.526 --> 00:42:42.467]  So see, I actually understand why your grandfather said that.
[00:42:42.707 --> 00:42:49.470]  But he's got to get his head around the fact that all white people don't have tails and we're not creeping around wanting to kill everybody.
[00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:55.172]  Just like all Hispanics aren't devils with hooves and horns creeping around wanting to kill everybody.
[00:42:55.952 --> 00:43:01.897]  See, people get abused, they get pushed around, they get cornered, and the New World Order are masters at funding them.
[00:43:02.057 --> 00:43:06.560]  And I'd have said to your grandfather, hey, I know where this came from.
[00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:10.783]  Did you know the German government funded you to do this to cause an insurrection?
[00:43:11.083 --> 00:43:19.149]  Now explain to me how you're going to kill all the whites, but you're funded by the German government during World War I. And see, then the wheels would have started turning.
[00:43:19.938 --> 00:43:20.158]  Right.
[00:43:20.298 --> 00:43:21.959]  You know, they're doing exactly what they said.
[00:43:22.359 --> 00:43:24.299]  Order out of chaos, divide and conquer.
[00:43:24.819 --> 00:43:29.161]  And they've started, you know, it's all happening with television and the movie industry.
[00:43:29.181 --> 00:43:30.901]  They're just brainwashing everybody.
[00:43:30.921 --> 00:43:42.104]  And I just wanted to call, I know you don't have a lot of time, say thank you for having the cojones to stand up and tell the truth so people like me can actually see it on your website and find out what's really going on.
[00:43:42.404 --> 00:43:43.445]  Thank you very much, sir.
[00:43:43.605 --> 00:43:44.785]  Well, I appreciate you, John.
[00:43:44.825 --> 00:43:47.786]  Well, John, I'll tell you, you know, when I have a birthday party at my house for my children,
[00:43:48.479 --> 00:43:56.844]  I don't like the fact that deep down I have to sit there and go, hmm, secretly somebody not like me, and then they have to know, oh, is he one of those white people that may want to kill me?
[00:44:09.665 --> 00:44:10.786]  And it's just like black folks.
[00:44:11.046 --> 00:44:12.848]  They have to ask, is that one of those racist whites?
[00:44:12.888 --> 00:44:15.251]  Now we've got to ask, is that one of those racist blacks?
[00:44:15.651 --> 00:44:17.433]  This is designed this way.
[00:44:18.054 --> 00:44:19.455]  I want us to live in peace.
[00:44:20.296 --> 00:44:23.939]  But to do that, we've got to decry all the groups that are doing this.
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:26.242]  And notice all this fake leftist stuff.
[00:44:27.171 --> 00:44:28.992]  About liberation theology.
[00:44:29.333 --> 00:44:32.235]  The left won't decry this black professor saying kill all whites.
[00:44:32.675 --> 00:44:37.058]  The left won't decry the Metrocrat saying kill all whites.
[00:44:37.678 --> 00:44:48.666]  I mean, I am sitting right now from a restaurant that is about a mile away where the owner openly advocates all this and has it up on the walls in Spanish and has pictures of it up all over his building.
[00:44:49.366 --> 00:44:50.187]  I mean, can you imagine?
[00:44:50.587 --> 00:44:52.188]  Folks, and I'm not going to go bullhorn him.
[00:44:52.248 --> 00:44:56.171]  I'm not going to go protesting because people won't even get it and the media will twist it.
[00:44:57.003 --> 00:45:04.268]  But I guarantee you if there was a Ku Klux Klan group over there with pictures of plans to kill all blacks or Hispanics, I'd go bullhorn it.
[00:45:05.269 --> 00:45:07.530]  Now I just admitted that I am politically a coward.
[00:45:09.051 --> 00:45:17.177]  There are so many of these extremist white supremacist people out there who never show up, never protest anything, but they'll say, oh Alex is evil, he's a sellout.
[00:45:17.677 --> 00:45:19.379]  No, you're a sellout, you're evil.
[00:45:20.479 --> 00:45:21.780]  You're playing the whole plan.
[00:45:23.809 --> 00:45:39.797]  But I can't go bullhorn this restaurant that openly has stuff on the walls calling for the killing of all whites because the media will lie about it and people won't get it and then my Hispanic friends will be watching TV and they'll just hear that I don't like Mexicans and I'm out protesting Mexicans.
[00:45:40.137 --> 00:45:43.839]  Now see, we've got to ask ourselves, why has this been set up this way?
[00:45:44.379 --> 00:45:45.940]  Why has this been done this way?
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.701]  Why has this been designed this way?
[00:45:49.315 --> 00:45:51.878]  They are just breeding a time bomb here.
[00:45:51.938 --> 00:45:53.680]  They have built it.
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:54.641]  They have designed it.
[00:45:54.962 --> 00:45:55.662]  Set the trap.
[00:45:55.722 --> 00:45:56.423]  Pin the time.
[00:45:56.483 --> 00:45:57.324]  Now you follow.
[00:45:57.965 --> 00:45:59.046]  I mean, they are doing it.
[00:45:59.126 --> 00:45:59.807]  Another John.
[00:45:59.847 --> 00:46:00.808]  This time in Texas.
[00:46:01.249 --> 00:46:02.130]  John, you're on the air.
[00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:02.490]  Welcome.
[00:46:03.271 --> 00:46:04.352]  Hi Alex.
[00:46:04.653 --> 00:46:05.133]  How you doing?
[00:46:05.874 --> 00:46:10.059]  Okay, it looks like Hollywood has enlisted Zorro in a fight against the New World Order.
[00:46:11.161 --> 00:46:12.082]  Have you seen the new movie yet?
[00:46:12.742 --> 00:46:14.003]  No, I haven't seen Zorro.
[00:46:14.343 --> 00:46:15.684]  It looks pretty cheesy, frankly.
[00:46:16.064 --> 00:46:19.586]  I like Antonio Banderas, but I don't like... I saw the ad for it.
[00:46:19.606 --> 00:46:20.346]  It looks ridiculous.
[00:46:20.746 --> 00:46:25.709]  Well, the plot of the movie is this evil count who belongs to a secret society.
[00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:39.417]  He's trying to keep California from coming into the Union, and they were going to sell necroglycerins to the Confederates, but they... He belongs to a secret society, and they meet in this tomb, like, underneath this hospital, and they got a
[00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:40.971]  Do you know who Jack Black is?
[00:46:40.991 --> 00:46:41.591]  Yes, I do.
[00:46:41.631 --> 00:46:44.373]  New Line Cinema and Jack Black just bought the rights
[00:47:07.588 --> 00:47:10.070]  Well, they've had others like, did you see the Kingdom of Heaven?
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:27.621]  That's a really good movie.
[00:47:27.721 --> 00:47:41.908]  Yeah, well, the bad knights, the evil knights in that movie were trying to stir up trouble between the Muslims and the Christians when a nice Templar, which wore a full runner instead of masons, which is trying to signify that skull and bones, which is an offshoot of masons, are causing trouble in the Middle East today.
[00:47:42.668 --> 00:47:45.510]  And they've got another movie coming out called Deeper Vendetta.
[00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:48.451]  I don't know if you've seen a preview of that one.
[00:47:48.471 --> 00:47:49.092]  I have, yes.
[00:47:50.673 --> 00:47:54.855]  Yeah, where this guy in a mask is fighting against global tyranny.
[00:47:56.471 --> 00:48:00.193]  Yeah, it's got the girl that plays Darth Vader's wife.
[00:48:01.373 --> 00:48:02.674]  Natalie Portman, I think her name is.
[00:48:02.694 --> 00:48:03.814]  Yeah, Natalie Portman, yeah.
[00:48:04.555 --> 00:48:06.936]  But it seems like, you know, they seem to be catching on out there anyway.
[00:48:06.976 --> 00:48:15.360]  I asked my, I told my wife when we were sitting in the audience, my wife told some people up there in the audience to say, well, my guy, our president, we had a president belonging to a group like that, you know.
[00:48:17.432 --> 00:48:19.353]  Well, they're having to throw it in our face.
[00:48:19.453 --> 00:48:27.977]  Suddenly, about three years ago, the gates lifted, and now they'll just flaunt everything and admit it all, and I think it's... I think more than that, it's all about desensitization.
[00:48:28.497 --> 00:48:39.162]  I mean, there are people in Hollywood that I know personally who are totally obsessed with the New World Order, who know all about the New World Order, who make films fighting it, and I'm not going to name names.
[00:48:39.202 --> 00:48:41.503]  I mean, it's more than one person in Hollywood, high up.
[00:48:41.523 --> 00:48:43.824]  In fact, I know a whole bunch of people in Hollywood
[00:48:44.504 --> 00:48:47.986]  And so when you see these films they really are trying to expose it.
[00:48:48.406 --> 00:48:53.348]  Now is the new order letting that film out because they believe at a subconscious level it desensitizes people?
[00:48:53.988 --> 00:48:58.931]  That may be happening, but I just think they can't control this information coming out anymore.
[00:48:59.551 --> 00:49:00.471]  I think they lost control.
[00:49:00.511 --> 00:49:01.652]  I think there's a lot of
[00:49:02.551 --> 00:49:08.837]  Especially in Hollywood now, a lot of people are starting to take a hard look and say, this isn't about liberal or conservatism, this is about, like you said, freedom or slavery.
[00:49:08.877 --> 00:49:15.303]  If you only knew, because I'm not going to drop names, and people haven't asked me not to drop names, but I'm just not into dropping names.
[00:49:15.703 --> 00:49:26.433]  If you knew how many, I mean, the pinnacle of Hollywood I've talked to, multiple peaks, not just one top Hollywood person or the other, I mean a whole score of them.
[00:49:26.793 --> 00:49:28.554]  And they are freaked out.
[00:49:28.894 --> 00:49:29.814]  They are upset.
[00:49:30.434 --> 00:49:37.617]  You see, we're getting down to the final equation here, where this isn't a joke anymore.
[00:49:37.637 --> 00:49:38.438]  This isn't fun.
[00:49:38.738 --> 00:49:41.599]  They're now finding out it is about exterminating 80% of us.
[00:49:41.879 --> 00:49:43.199]  It is about total enslavement.
[00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:46.541]  Everybody's going to be a slave, except for a few thousand people.
[00:49:46.981 --> 00:49:52.143]  A lot of people that thought they were elitists because they had $500 million in the bank are finding out they're nothing.
[00:49:52.856 --> 00:49:53.517]  They're nothing!
[00:49:54.157 --> 00:49:58.221]  And so, look, for every action there's an equal to greater reaction.
[00:49:58.261 --> 00:49:59.221]  It's the law of the universe.
[00:49:59.261 --> 00:49:59.762]  God's law.
[00:50:00.202 --> 00:50:04.906]  And so as the new world order rises, sir, you've got to realize our power is going to rise.
[00:50:05.427 --> 00:50:06.587]  You've got to realize that.
[00:50:07.228 --> 00:50:13.874]  Well, I'd like to hope to think that there's going to be resistance to them, that the people are not going to sit still and knuckle under the tyranny.
[00:50:14.434 --> 00:50:17.396]  I don't know if they're living in Disneyland up there or what, but they should know that
[00:50:18.467 --> 00:50:27.854]  And most of the people who grew up in the World War II movies, where the people in Europe rose up against the Nazis, they know, they must know that they're going to have one heck of a trouble on their hands when it happens.
[00:50:28.835 --> 00:50:29.555]  Well, they do know that.
[00:50:29.595 --> 00:50:32.858]  That's why they're putting in a military MIT-designed control grid.
[00:50:32.878 --> 00:50:36.260]  The Pentagon had mentioned these cameras, these microphones, these transponder readers.
[00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:38.121]  That was Pentagon-designed 15 years ago.
[00:50:39.645 --> 00:50:42.667]  Pentagon Brexit is a population control grid.
[00:50:43.008 --> 00:50:44.569]  It is an electronic straitjacket.
[00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:47.911]  And look, the veneer of civilization is very, very thin.
[00:50:48.612 --> 00:50:51.914]  And when this stuff comes down, they plan on us all having a big race war.
[00:50:52.375 --> 00:50:53.135]  It's not going to happen.
[00:50:53.376 --> 00:50:55.017]  We're going to neutralize the race war.
[00:50:55.037 --> 00:50:57.659]  We're going to come together, and we're going to smash the New World Order.
[00:50:57.879 --> 00:50:58.960]  We know who the enemy is.
[00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:00.181]  You hear that, Queen Elizabeth?
[00:51:01.562 --> 00:51:05.906]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.087 --> 00:51:10.531]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.671 --> 00:51:15.035]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:15.075 --> 00:51:16.417]  The New World Order.
[00:51:17.153 --> 00:51:18.154]  Panama!
[00:51:18.214 --> 00:51:22.436]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.496 --> 00:51:29.420]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:31.601]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.921 --> 00:51:42.266]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.546 --> 00:51:43.507]  If you want to understand
[00:51:43.627 --> 00:51:43.967]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:44.027 --> 00:51:45.329]  Order today and spread the word!
[00:52:01.161 --> 00:52:07.383]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:52:07.523 --> 00:52:13.685]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:52:13.965 --> 00:52:22.388]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:52:22.648 --> 00:52:29.670]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:52:29.970 --> 00:52:34.793]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:52:35.013 --> 00:52:40.417]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:52:40.757 --> 00:52:43.839]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:52.165]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:52.185 --> 00:52:52.765]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:02.493]  I think so.
[00:53:17.771 --> 00:53:18.151]  I think so.
[00:53:37.967 --> 00:53:38.447]  We're good to go!
[00:54:01.404 --> 00:54:09.507]  Okay, we're going to go to Joe in Wisconsin and Ian in Canada and many others here in a few minutes.
[00:54:09.547 --> 00:54:17.610]  Paul Watson joins us in about ten.
[00:54:31.318 --> 00:54:35.080]  And we're going to get into a whole cornucopia, a plethora of issues.
[00:54:36.821 --> 00:54:54.071]  But before I do that, now is the time to take advantage of the specials we're running on my videos, on my documentary films, on the t-shirts, and on the other books and videos and books on tape and CDs, you know, books on CDs that we're carrying.

[00:55:21.304 --> 00:55:21.804]  Three t-shirts
[00:55:24.326 --> 00:55:24.946]  We're good!

[00:56:05.339 --> 00:56:06.379]  That's a $30 discount.
[00:56:10.217 --> 00:56:19.485]  So it's $44.95 and that's only going through Christmas, only going through the first of the year, January 1st on those insane specials.
[00:56:19.725 --> 00:56:21.186]  We'll have some new specials after that.

[00:56:31.595 --> 00:56:33.257]  Present them at your local dorm.
[00:56:35.686 --> 00:56:39.188]  You know, go rent a movie screen and put it up at the park and show it to people.

[00:56:41.789 --> 00:56:44.390]  I want to warn the public about the New World Order.
[00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:45.891]  That is my burning desire.
[00:56:46.171 --> 00:56:50.834]  That is the focus and the thrust of everything we do and the power of you, the listeners.
[00:56:51.374 --> 00:56:54.256]  Getting the videos, making copies, getting them out to people is massive.

[00:57:20.773 --> 00:57:22.174]  Let's talk to Joe in Wisconsin.
[00:57:22.194 --> 00:57:22.755]  Joe, welcome.
[00:57:23.351 --> 00:57:23.872]  Hey, Alex.
[00:57:24.232 --> 00:57:24.412]  Hi.
[00:57:24.772 --> 00:57:38.526]  I did a little number crunching on the NAFTA Senate votes, and I was breaking it down by the states that voted overwhelming, the ones that voted against it, and then the states that, you know, one voted one, one voted the other.
[00:57:39.186 --> 00:57:41.749]  And I got some pretty interesting things out of it.
[00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:43.871]  If you pair up
[00:57:44.451 --> 00:57:48.954]  Your Republican and Democrat states, they overwhelmingly vote for it.
[00:57:49.555 --> 00:57:56.380]  So if we took, you know, one Democrat and one Republican Senator, they would vote for it.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:07.108]  But if you split them, if you paired up Democrats with each other and Republicans with each other, then it would have barely passed by two votes.
[00:58:07.969 --> 00:58:13.052]  And I was thinking about making it an interactive web page where people can change different parameters, like
[00:58:14.375 --> 00:58:16.655]  If this happened, what would the vote be?
[00:58:17.296 --> 00:58:19.596]  If we had pure Democrats, how would it turn out?
[00:58:19.616 --> 00:58:20.796]  You know, Republicans.
[00:58:21.196 --> 00:58:26.837]  And I was going to ask if there are webpages out there like that, so I could send it to you and make it look like that.
[00:58:27.578 --> 00:58:30.758]  Well, I guarantee you this, if you build something like that, that's interesting.
[00:58:30.778 --> 00:58:32.478]  You ought to write an article about it and send it to us.
[00:58:32.518 --> 00:58:33.099]  We'd post it.
[00:58:33.639 --> 00:58:34.259]  Stay there, though.
[00:58:34.299 --> 00:58:38.920]  I want to find out... I mean, boil it down for us, because I'm kind of ignorant.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:39.900]  I'm not getting all of it.
[00:58:41.354 --> 00:58:46.239]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.762 --> 00:58:58.402]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.062 --> 00:59:00.123]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.843 --> 00:59:01.943]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.603 --> 00:59:03.403]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.164 --> 00:59:05.104]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.724 --> 00:59:09.505]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.905 --> 00:59:13.986]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:27.522 --> 00:59:28.642]  Hello, my friends.
[00:59:29.423 --> 00:59:37.187]  We are now into the second hour of this Wednesday, the second day of November 2005 edition.
[00:59:37.587 --> 00:59:42.750]  Paul Watson, with his bi-weekly report, will be joining us coming up in the next segment.
[00:59:42.770 --> 00:59:44.891]  We'll continue with the news and your calls.
[00:59:45.669 --> 00:59:52.311]  We were just talking to a caller at the end of the last hour who crunched some of the numbers on NAFTA, the NAFTA vote.
[00:59:52.331 --> 01:00:11.318]  When he said NAFTA, I would guess he doesn't mean the vote of 1994, but I would guess he means the vote of earlier this year for the expansion of NAFTA that was CAFTA, which then leads into the free trade area of the Americas.
[01:00:11.778 --> 01:00:14.759]  But please elaborate, please elaborate for us, Joe.
[01:00:15.811 --> 01:00:24.735]  Okay, actually I did go back to the 94 vote and there were 61 people for 38 May and one didn't vote.
[01:00:25.816 --> 01:00:28.957]  So what I did was I broke it up into three sections.
[01:00:29.317 --> 01:00:37.801]  The states that voted pure yes, the states that voted purely no, and then states that one voted yes and one voted no.
[01:00:38.801 --> 01:00:39.982]  And I'm looking at
[01:00:40.703 --> 01:00:43.665]  The states that were Democrat that voted for it.
[01:00:43.765 --> 01:00:57.316]  Supposed bastions of Democratic philosophy and the people who voted for it were Massachusetts, Louisiana, Illinois, Connecticut, and Arkansas.
[01:00:57.516 --> 01:00:59.738]  Where it's well known they have total election fraud.
[01:01:00.138 --> 01:01:00.538]  Oh yeah!
[01:01:00.879 --> 01:01:02.040]  Total state sponsored.
[01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:03.221]  I don't mean voter fraud folks.
[01:01:03.501 --> 01:01:05.522]  I mean you don't really have a chance to vote in those states.
[01:01:06.383 --> 01:01:08.685]  Well then I took a look at the other states
[01:01:09.355 --> 01:01:10.636]  That voted for it.
[01:01:11.336 --> 01:01:15.278]  And most of them were paired up Republican and Democrat.
[01:01:15.658 --> 01:01:17.098]  And I'm thinking, wait a minute.
[01:01:17.699 --> 01:01:20.080]  I thought Bill Clinton was the Republican's enemy.
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:23.661]  So why are they voting for something that he's pushing?
[01:01:24.021 --> 01:01:28.403]  Well, sir, it's the same on every major vote and almost every major issue.
[01:01:28.443 --> 01:01:29.464]  It's smoke and mirrors.
[01:01:29.724 --> 01:01:36.247]  Yeah, and I took a look at the states that voted no, and it's overwhelmingly Democrat.
[01:01:36.886 --> 01:01:44.840]  And it's like, again, if the Democrats are for something Clinton is pushing, then why are they voting against it?
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:50.309]  Well, I mean, Chuckie Schumer and a bunch of other Democratic Senators are going after Bush right now, but...
[01:01:51.201 --> 01:01:57.106]  They almost outvoted the Republicans for the war, and then now they're just scoring political points.
[01:01:57.166 --> 01:01:59.228]  I mean, Chuckie Schumer knew that was fake intelligence.
[01:01:59.268 --> 01:02:00.529]  It had been in the news, it was all fake.
[01:02:00.849 --> 01:02:03.752]  Beforehand, Chuckie Schumer needs to get in trouble.
[01:02:03.952 --> 01:02:05.713]  They all need to get in trouble.
[01:02:06.054 --> 01:02:10.778]  And meanwhile, Republicans will go, well, Schumer and Hillary voted for the war, that means it's okay.
[01:02:11.118 --> 01:02:15.141]  No, it isn't okay that you're all corrupt liars attacking innocent countries.
[01:02:15.381 --> 01:02:18.164]  It makes it even worse that both parties are engaged in this.
[01:02:18.624 --> 01:02:21.185]  You know, both parties are making money off the war.
[01:02:21.565 --> 01:02:25.186]  Both parties are, you know, leaders own stock with the defense contractors.
[01:02:25.646 --> 01:02:31.948]  You know, now it's come out that Michael Moore just doesn't own a few stocks with Halliburton and groups like Carlisle.
[01:02:32.388 --> 01:02:35.469]  He owns massive stocks with them and the little bastard knows it.
[01:02:36.267 --> 01:02:46.793]  Listen, you don't think, listen, I said four or five years ago, I said before 9-11, I said buy biometric stocks if you're evil and you don't care about making money off blood and Nazi type activities.
[01:02:47.154 --> 01:02:49.195]  I said buy defense stocks when they were real low.
[01:02:49.495 --> 01:02:51.276]  Not that I'm a genius, it's common sense.
[01:02:51.456 --> 01:02:52.377]  I didn't go buy them.
[01:02:52.957 --> 01:02:54.518]  I don't care about making money, folks.
[01:02:54.698 --> 01:02:57.420]  I will not do immoral things for money.
[01:02:57.820 --> 01:02:58.300]  Period.
[01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:01.242]  But Michael Moore will.
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:06.483]  Well, what I was going to do is I was also going to allow the user to enter different numbers.
[01:03:06.563 --> 01:03:12.588]  Like, if they were to slant everything completely one way or the other, how would everything break down?
[01:03:13.028 --> 01:03:18.051]  Just put in the numbers for this Congress and see what the numbers for NAFTA would have been.
[01:03:18.492 --> 01:03:19.132]  Things like that.
[01:03:19.693 --> 01:03:21.974]  Or put in a different bill altogether.
[01:03:21.994 --> 01:03:25.237]  Well, it sounds like a lot of work, sir, but if you want to do it... Sure.
[01:03:25.597 --> 01:03:29.700]  I can put a small database in there and let things fall where they may.
[01:03:30.615 --> 01:03:36.340]  If these people would have voted their conscience this way, how would this vote turn out?
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:37.101]  Do me a favor.
[01:03:37.121 --> 01:03:39.803]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com where it says Contact Webmaster.
[01:03:40.184 --> 01:03:41.505]  That's the email to send it to.
[01:03:41.725 --> 01:03:43.947]  PrisonPlanet at Hotmail.com.
[01:03:44.367 --> 01:03:44.668]  You bet.
[01:03:44.728 --> 01:03:46.349]  Paul checks that out five times a day.
[01:03:46.389 --> 01:03:46.709]  Thank you.
[01:03:46.850 --> 01:03:48.831]  We'll be right back with Paul Wadiwad.
[01:03:48.951 --> 01:03:49.272]  Stay with us.
[01:03:54.514 --> 01:03:57.376]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.616 --> 01:03:59.197]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.

[01:04:04.561 --> 01:04:11.285]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:11.625 --> 01:04:13.587]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:04:13.807 --> 01:04:16.649]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.730 --> 01:04:21.394]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.594 --> 01:04:26.018]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.258 --> 01:04:33.484]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:04:55.177 --> 01:04:56.218]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:04:56.538 --> 01:04:59.341]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:59.601 --> 01:05:03.745]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:04.185 --> 01:05:05.026]  So what do you do?
[01:05:05.327 --> 01:05:09.891]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:10.371 --> 01:05:12.513]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:12.993 --> 01:05:13.894]  Sheltering in Place!
[01:05:14.294 --> 01:05:27.705]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:27.745 --> 01:05:34.811]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[01:05:54.628 --> 01:05:56.229]  Government is best what governs least.
[01:05:56.790 --> 01:05:58.091]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:05:58.531 --> 01:06:01.213]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:06:01.694 --> 01:06:04.336]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:06:04.776 --> 01:06:11.241]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:06:32.073 --> 01:06:33.514]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[01:06:33.694 --> 01:06:34.034]  Have you?
[01:06:34.615 --> 01:06:36.135]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[01:06:36.575 --> 01:06:38.496]  Go to LibertyStickers.com or call 877-873-9626.
[01:06:38.516 --> 01:06:40.397]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[01:06:44.798 --> 01:06:48.140]  Well, we're now into the second segment of this second hour.
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:49.261]  Eight minutes, nineteen seconds in.
[01:07:15.456 --> 01:07:22.267]  And Paul Watson will now be joining us for much of the rest of the duration of the broadcast.
[01:07:22.287 --> 01:07:23.449]  We're going to be taking your calls.
[01:07:25.683 --> 01:07:29.664]  Sharon and Sam and Paul and many others will be getting to your calls.
[01:07:30.525 --> 01:07:52.112]  Right now we're going to be talking about new evidence of government complicity just to the ever increasing mountain of evidence with the London bombings and then also how right on time Al Qaeda is threatening to attack Australia because the government's having trouble passing laws to literally turn the country into a total police state with absolutely no rights, no free speech.
[01:07:52.692 --> 01:07:56.435]  They've already gotten their guns, so first they take the guns, then comes the slavery part.
[01:07:56.876 --> 01:07:57.957]  Slaves can't own guns, folks.
[01:07:57.997 --> 01:07:58.537]  It's that simple.
[01:07:59.138 --> 01:08:06.684]  And we'll also get into the latest bird flu, fear-mongering in the Western world, as well as in Asia.
[01:08:07.705 --> 01:08:11.809]  And also get into the deteriorating situation.
[01:08:12.149 --> 01:08:14.231]  Violence is now at all-time highs.
[01:08:14.955 --> 01:08:25.102]  Three days ago, it was the third most dangerous month on record, but now with the new deaths racked up in the last three days, it is the most deadly month ever.
[01:08:25.943 --> 01:08:31.466]  So, or most deadly period, actually year, excuse me, for the two and a half years they've been there.
[01:08:31.486 --> 01:08:33.008]  I need to get my numbers out on that.
[01:08:33.748 --> 01:08:36.870]  But Paul Watson, good to have you on the air with us.
[01:08:37.431 --> 01:08:38.371]  Good to be back, Alex.
[01:08:39.392 --> 01:08:40.613]  Paul, there is a whole
[01:08:41.992 --> 01:08:57.381]  constellation of news and information to cover, but the first thing I want to get into is an article that you put together a few days ago just chronicling a few of the high-powered whistleblowers and people that have been going public.
[01:08:57.421 --> 01:09:08.707]  From Ron Paul to Andres Von Bulow to Michael Meacher to Paul Craig Roberts to Morgan Reynolds
[01:09:09.347 --> 01:09:10.808]  Well yeah, they're political heavyweights.
[01:09:11.048 --> 01:09:13.850]  As I made the point in the article immediately after September 11th,
[01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:41.892]  You became a pariah if you spoke out against the administration.
[01:09:41.972 --> 01:09:44.674]  Cynthia McKinney was one of the first put to the sword.
[01:09:44.694 --> 01:09:47.596]  We're even saying that Bush had prior knowledge of 9-11.
[01:09:48.337 --> 01:09:49.598]  She was run out of office.
[01:09:50.963 --> 01:10:12.676]  Then, as we moved into 2003, 2004, the soil was definitely more fertile because we had people like von Bülow coming out in Germany, former technology minister in Germany, Michael Meacher, former Blair environment minister, saying that the war on terrorism was bogus in an article for the London Guardian.
[01:10:13.276 --> 01:10:16.958]  Later on, after the London bombings, he said that that stunk to high heaven.
[01:10:19.013 --> 01:10:28.380]  Other people like David Shaler, obviously former MI5 agent, said that there's no other way that 9-11 could have happened without there being inside involvement.
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:31.182]  He also recently came out and said that
[01:10:31.767 --> 01:10:43.029]  Blair, he'd seen Blair's file at MI5 and he was an MI5 spy, spying on subversives within trade union organisations, things like that.
[01:10:43.529 --> 01:10:49.671]  So we have this cosy image in Britain of Blair being some radical university guy with a guitar.
[01:10:50.371 --> 01:10:55.112]  And in fact he was in the pay of MI5 all along, so Shirley came out and said that.
[01:10:56.952 --> 01:11:00.733]  As you mentioned, Chief Economist for the Department of Labour, Morgan Reynolds,
[01:11:01.363 --> 01:11:06.824]  Detailed analysis on the collapse of Building 7 that made waves a few months ago.
[01:11:07.785 --> 01:11:24.849]  George Galloway, who's a very high presence Member of Parliament here in the UK, he's always being attacked by the BBC, came out and said that there's a very real danger that elements within the state would carry out terror as a pretext to go into Iran or Syria.
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:40.101]  Um, Ron Paul, as he mentioned, said that Bush administration response to Hurricane Katrina was basically about gun confiscation and getting people used to the idea of total state control in light of natural disasters.
[01:11:40.982 --> 01:11:41.984]  And then Ray McGovern...
[01:11:42.589 --> 01:11:57.474]  Who, um, briefed Bush 41 on a daily basis, added himself to that same list by saying that if there's some kind of provocation, big violent explosions, then we shouldn't believe the word of the masters there in Washington telling us who's behind them.
[01:12:01.116 --> 01:12:04.917]  So in light of this, um, terror scare in Australia,
[01:12:05.805 --> 01:12:07.986]  That's exactly what they've been caught doing.
[01:12:08.006 --> 01:12:21.549]  They're trying to run through terrorism laws that include provisions whereby peaceful anti-war protesters could be jailed for seven years under the language that they support the opposition of the Australian military.
[01:12:21.589 --> 01:12:23.970]  Whoever that may be, that makes them terrorists.
[01:12:24.890 --> 01:12:35.053]  They're also talking about trying to allow overseas video evidence to be used in federal courts, which is basically a welcoming of evidence obtained under torture
[01:12:36.039 --> 01:12:43.321]  Also, what MI5 in this country and Britain openly embraced last week, they said that they'll use evidence obtained by torture and treat it as reliable.
[01:12:44.042 --> 01:12:46.523]  No one's really ever done that in modern time.
[01:12:46.543 --> 01:12:59.047]  You know, just come right out and admit they're torturing people and say we'll use it, when all the textbooks, all the people that have engaged in torture, all that we know about it, said it's totally unreliable and you can't trust a government that'll do it.
[01:13:00.047 --> 01:13:02.988]  Well, the Brits sent their own ambassador over to Uzbekistan.
[01:13:03.897 --> 01:13:20.249]  Who said that in effect they were creating a false Al-Qaeda presence by just randomly grabbing people, torturing them, forcing them into confessions and that allowed the government of Uzbekistan to make a crackdown because the people were hoodwinked into believing that there was this Al-Qaeda presence.
[01:13:20.809 --> 01:13:29.335]  Then the British government was handed this report and said that they would continue to use evidence obtained under torture by the government of Uzbekistan.
[01:13:29.355 --> 01:13:30.136]  They didn't care!
[01:13:32.582 --> 01:13:43.389]  But the British government will send people to prison who've tortured if they get caught or don't know how to take pictures, and our government will do it while it's publicly available information that our government ordered the torture.
[01:13:43.710 --> 01:13:46.832]  Then Bush says, I'm going to veto a law restricting torture.
[01:13:46.972 --> 01:13:52.135]  I'm for torture, but he doesn't go to prison, but he lets England and Grainer and others go to prison.
[01:13:52.355 --> 01:13:53.256]  I mean, it's insane.
[01:13:53.316 --> 01:13:54.697]  It's just obvious.
[01:13:55.117 --> 01:13:55.898]  It's ridiculous.
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:05.083]  Well, in the press conference yesterday that Rumsfeld gave, they directly questioned him about the force-feeding torture now going on at Guantanamo Bay.
[01:14:05.504 --> 01:14:13.127]  Sticking tubes the size of fingers down people's noses into their stomachs directly without anaesthetic or any proper surgical procedure.
[01:14:13.147 --> 01:14:16.208]  They're convulsing, spewing up blood, having fits.
[01:14:16.824 --> 01:14:21.346]  And Rumsfeld's answer to that was, well, I'm not a doctor, so I can't comment.
[01:14:21.686 --> 01:14:24.747]  Well, that's what the Chinese do to the Falun Gong.
[01:14:24.767 --> 01:14:38.912]  You use a bigger tube, and they insert it and remove it over and over again, cramming it down your nose and down your esophagus into your gullet, and then they'll pour hot water down it, which is going on at Camp X-Ray, and people go, who cares?
[01:14:38.972 --> 01:14:39.693]  Torture them!
[01:14:39.913 --> 01:14:40.633]  They're Al-Qaeda!
[01:14:41.253 --> 01:14:45.036]  The government admits there's no Al-Qaeda, no Taliban of any level there.
[01:14:45.056 --> 01:14:46.897]  There's little goat herders they grabbed.
[01:14:47.197 --> 01:14:49.479]  Real Taliban and Al-Qaeda are CIA folks.
[01:14:49.739 --> 01:14:54.422]  They were loaded on planes and flown out to safety and top generals have gone public discussing with that fact.
[01:14:55.595 --> 01:15:02.259]  Yeah, and there was recently that PBS documentary confirming that Rick Baucus was fired because he refused to torture at Guantanamo Bay.
[01:15:02.459 --> 01:15:03.920]  That's Brigadier General Rick Baucus.
[01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:07.783]  And then the same thing with... Oh, another whistleblower!
[01:15:07.823 --> 01:15:14.127]  We just had the Brigadier General on, Janice Kopinski, on the show.
[01:15:14.207 --> 01:15:18.229]  She wasn't even allowed in the wings, controlled by military intelligence and CIA.
[01:15:18.489 --> 01:15:24.313]  She complained about it, the fact that she wasn't allowed to have oversight, and so they tried to stick her with it.
[01:15:24.833 --> 01:15:27.194]  And then, it's totally insane!
[01:15:28.055 --> 01:15:29.376]  Yeah, now she's all over the place.
[01:15:29.676 --> 01:15:32.257]  Pointing the finger directly at Rumsfeld for being the architect.
[01:15:32.297 --> 01:15:33.798]  You know, where are the indictments there?
[01:15:33.818 --> 01:15:35.419]  Where are the criminal proceedings there?
[01:15:35.699 --> 01:15:36.279]  Exactly!
[01:15:36.339 --> 01:15:39.041]  We have the, well, who's the head of law enforcement?
[01:15:39.481 --> 01:15:43.904]  We have Alberto Gonzales that wrote the memo saying we can torture people to death.
[01:15:43.964 --> 01:15:46.145]  Just type Gonzales Memo in.
[01:15:46.165 --> 01:15:48.546]  You'll get Reuters, AP, CNN.
[01:15:48.586 --> 01:15:49.567]  You'll get copies of them.
[01:15:49.607 --> 01:15:50.107]  Okay, folks?
[01:15:50.487 --> 01:15:51.248]  Cops out there.
[01:15:51.928 --> 01:15:53.549]  Grand jurors driving around right now.
[01:15:54.489 --> 01:15:59.954]  District Attorneys, whether you're listening in Chicago, or in LA, or whether you're listening in Austin, Texas.
[01:16:00.174 --> 01:16:08.142]  Hey, Ronnie Earl here in Austin, Texas, you want to indict people, we got a memo written by Gonzales saying that to torture people to death.
[01:16:09.343 --> 01:16:12.246]  So you want to, go after the Attorney General, buddy!
[01:16:13.672 --> 01:16:14.032]  Go ahead.
[01:16:14.052 --> 01:16:17.255]  And, um, Coot-Libby's replaced him.
[01:16:17.336 --> 01:16:24.182]  Adlington, he was another author of the torture memo, saying that the Geneva Convention was obsolete as long as it comes out with.
[01:16:24.302 --> 01:16:31.709]  Well, look at who is now in control of all, quote, intelligence, domestic and international.
[01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:36.614]  It's Negroponte, who openly was the death squad architect.
[01:16:36.654 --> 01:16:37.855]  I mean, this guy's incredible.
[01:16:38.792 --> 01:16:39.212]  Exactly.
[01:16:39.233 --> 01:16:42.235]  Now I'm going back to the Australia situation.
[01:16:42.735 --> 01:16:49.901]  Basically, the Prime Minister Howard, as happens in every case, is facing an uphill battle trying to justify these draconian laws.
[01:16:50.542 --> 01:16:56.706]  He's getting opposition from doctors, organisations, human rights, artists, musicians, TV personalities.
[01:16:57.527 --> 01:17:00.009]  So, surprise surprise, what's in the news today?
[01:17:00.109 --> 01:17:03.612]  Australia receives threats of terror attack, Associated Press.
[01:17:04.309 --> 01:17:18.282]  Australian authorities have received specific intelligence, which they won't tell us, that terrorists are planning an attack on the country, Prime Minister John Howard said Wednesday, calling on lawmakers to increase the powers of Australia's intelligence agencies.
[01:17:19.028 --> 01:17:31.934]  So, just coincidentally, as he's facing vociferous opposition to these terror laws, our useful Al-Qaeda friends pop up and help the Prime Minister push through his political agenda, so he's playing his terror card.
[01:17:32.154 --> 01:17:33.435]  Well, they always do!
[01:17:33.515 --> 01:17:41.179]  You could set your watch and warrant, by the time that they come out of the little Defense Department jack-in-the-box,
[01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:46.544]  And, you know, going back to Blair being MI5, it's now publicly known he's been MI5 all along.
[01:17:46.965 --> 01:17:50.868]  It's like Putin being KGB from the time he was 18 years old.
[01:17:50.908 --> 01:17:52.069]  It's like Bush Sr.
[01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:53.751]  being CIA director.
[01:17:53.791 --> 01:17:55.512]  They claimed, oh, he was just given the directorship.
[01:17:55.773 --> 01:18:06.642]  He'd never been a spy, and now it's come out, of course, he was one right out of the Air Force, right out of the Navy after World War II, and in Dallas in 1963, on that fateful day, by the way.
[01:18:06.702 --> 01:18:08.164]  Nice little fellow, nice little operative.
[01:18:08.604 --> 01:18:10.566]  Been well rewarded and now his little son.
[01:18:11.006 --> 01:18:13.828]  So literally we're just run by the intelligence agencies.
[01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:21.894]  Yeah, well they tried to create the same thing with Bush as this drunk college idiot image which he got in the 70s.
[01:18:22.354 --> 01:18:24.156]  Blair had exactly the same thing.
[01:18:24.196 --> 01:18:25.277]  He was a dropout.
[01:18:26.678 --> 01:18:30.180]  You know, with the guitar, playing the guitar, the long hair, he was alternative.
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:33.543]  He was against the establishment when he was working for the establishment all along.
[01:18:36.514 --> 01:18:37.835]  You're absolutely right, Paul.
[01:18:37.875 --> 01:18:47.563]  Come back and when we get back we'll get into the bird flu, we'll get into a host of other really important issues.
[01:18:48.304 --> 01:18:51.687]  So you'll want to stay with us, ladies and gentlemen, on the other side of this quick break.

[01:21:53.177 --> 01:22:02.303]  Did you know that recent estimates by the Arthritis Foundation put the number of Americans with arthritis or chronic joint symptoms at 66 million, or 1 in 3 adults?
[01:22:02.323 --> 01:22:06.926]  Or that arthritis is the nation's leading cause of disability among Americans over age 15?
[01:22:07.287 --> 01:22:11.229]  Most individuals diagnosed with arthritis don't think anything can be done to help.
[01:22:11.570 --> 01:22:16.593]  Those who are aware of treatment options fear the debilitating side effects associated with prescription drugs.
[01:22:17.013 --> 01:22:20.796]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we feature herbal formulations like Joint Care,
[01:22:21.076 --> 01:22:21.696]  We're good to go!
[01:22:45.510 --> 01:22:54.377]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:22:54.417 --> 01:22:56.678]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:16.207 --> 01:23:18.669]  Alright folks, we're back live talking to Paul Watson.
[01:23:20.851 --> 01:23:26.056]  And coming up in the next segment, I will get to Ian, Shannon, Scott, and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:23:27.197 --> 01:23:29.019]  Paul, the bird flu.
[01:23:29.279 --> 01:23:42.371]  I mean, I hate to toot our horn, but we're not going to get any respect, and people still will listen to the next scam when the bird flu doesn't kill everyone this winter or early next year.
[01:23:43.078 --> 01:23:49.361]  I mean, so many top scientists, so many top experts are saying it is just science fiction, fraud, hoax.
[01:23:50.021 --> 01:23:59.985]  Those are the words that are being used, and publicly, Rumsfeld and all these top Bilderberg Group members are making all this money, billions of dollars, folks, and then we're supposed to ignore it, Paul?
[01:24:01.246 --> 01:24:01.826]  Well, that's right.
[01:24:01.866 --> 01:24:05.387]  We pointed it out basically as soon as this became a big issue.
[01:24:05.907 --> 01:24:11.930]  A major stockholder in Tamiflu, the maker of the bird flu, avian flu vaccine,
[01:24:12.492 --> 01:24:13.912]  was Donald Rumsfeld.
[01:24:14.433 --> 01:24:18.374]  It's owned by Gilead, of which he was the former chairman.
[01:24:18.794 --> 01:24:24.996]  Also George Shultz, Top Builder Burgers, D'Avignon and De Vink also own the major stock.
[01:24:25.736 --> 01:24:37.880]  So I think it was two days ago Fortune Magazine came out and said the same thing that all the alternative news websites have been saying for a few weeks that Rumsfeld is the main person that stands to gain from it.
[01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:42.101]  Could be very dangerous for him though because over the pond in this country
[01:24:42.765 --> 01:25:00.381]  Today we've had the resignation of David Blunkett, the former Home Secretary from a different office in pensions, but he was one of the main proponents of the ID card in Britain, and at that time he was pushing for the DNA standard to be included on the National ID Card.
[01:25:00.901 --> 01:25:09.809]  Turns out that he had undeclared stocks in a company called DNA Bioscience, which developed the technology for those kind of standards.
[01:25:10.329 --> 01:25:12.712]  Now, this is very exciting.
[01:25:12.752 --> 01:25:23.044]  This is now, what, the seventh time in the last eight years that they have full court press, national TV saying everyone must have it, children's cartoons saying everyone must have it.
[01:25:23.064 --> 01:25:24.005]  It's the same over here now.
[01:25:24.305 --> 01:25:26.447]  Just massive posters and billboards.
[01:25:26.708 --> 01:25:27.529]  You've got to have this.
[01:25:27.609 --> 01:25:28.650]  Oh, it'll be so great.
[01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:31.253]  And 80 plus percent of the Brits are against it.
[01:25:31.873 --> 01:25:36.777]  And to have this creature have to resign, again, the people don't want this police state.
[01:25:36.817 --> 01:25:48.766]  Now, over here, 90 plus percent in polls are against the National ID Card, but did that stop our traitorous, larcenous, scrofulous Congress from voting it through?
[01:25:48.786 --> 01:25:53.669]  I mean, almost no one voted against it.
[01:25:54.009 --> 01:25:54.650]  It's incredible.
[01:25:55.660 --> 01:26:01.662]  Well they've covered all the bases because now you've got your RFID chip on your passport as well.
[01:26:02.762 --> 01:26:13.745]  In this country they're trying to make us believe that only 20% of the people against it when in all the BBC polls it shows 85% against and in many of those polls they've tried to skew them.
[01:26:14.868 --> 01:26:17.611]  It was sold on the basis of protecting our information.
[01:26:17.671 --> 01:26:24.178]  Turns out that the way the government's going to fund it is by selling all our information to corporations.
[01:26:24.198 --> 01:26:25.219]  Well, it's always the same.
[01:26:25.359 --> 01:26:26.681]  This is how the Ponzi scheme works.
[01:26:26.801 --> 01:26:29.323]  It's the government giving out all the data.
[01:26:29.343 --> 01:26:30.004]  This is admitted.
[01:26:30.024 --> 01:26:31.686]  You read industry publications, it's admitted.
[01:26:32.146 --> 01:26:40.193]  It's our government selling all this data and giving it to corporations that's causing over 80 percent, again that number, of the identity theft.
[01:26:40.213 --> 01:26:44.536]  But they've convinced everyone it's the internet and the corner store where all this is happening.
[01:26:45.497 --> 01:26:51.822]  Exactly, and they've even had top Microsoft officials come out and say that it would only increase identity theft.
[01:26:52.903 --> 01:26:54.364]  So it's the same scheme every time.
[01:26:54.404 --> 01:26:59.068]  They were trying to introduce it in Australia on the back of these terror laws which we were talking about earlier.
[01:26:59.428 --> 01:27:01.330]  Same policies, different countries.
[01:27:02.734 --> 01:27:06.903]  Well, they know what they're doing, and then when it gets worse, they're gonna say, oh, we need a microchip.
[01:27:06.943 --> 01:27:10.912]  In fact, Tommy Thompson's already traveling the country, coast to coast, promoting it.
[01:27:12.489 --> 01:27:12.930]  Exactly.
[01:27:14.111 --> 01:27:21.797]  Going back to the bird flu thing, as you mentioned, it was the Spanish government that came out and called it science fiction, their agricultural minister.
[01:27:21.837 --> 01:27:25.480]  The Russians have basically said the same thing, other countries have questioned it.
[01:27:26.041 --> 01:27:36.270]  Well they said it's a scam to sell Tamiflu and to corner the poultry market, which Tyson's already dominant in, and then now we have the top Canadian side saying it's a complete fabrication.
[01:27:37.279 --> 01:27:42.863]  Yeah, so I mean at that level it's just cronyism, but when it gets to the level of using military assets on U.S.
[01:27:42.903 --> 01:27:50.808]  soils, Bush announced a few weeks ago, and possibility of forced inoculations, then it's a step above cronyism and it affects us all.
[01:27:50.848 --> 01:27:52.469]  So that's why we're blowing the whistle on it.
[01:27:53.150 --> 01:28:02.456]  Yeah, it's not enough for them to sit there and suck everything dry and make billions a piece while they're in office, literally bleeding us like a fat hog they've hung up by its angles.
[01:28:02.916 --> 01:28:05.178]  Now they want to have open dictatorship and they can
[01:28:07.079 --> 01:28:09.540]  Well, I'm about to say they can go somewhere, but we're not putting up with it.
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:21.702]  No, but it gives them the, uh... I mean, it won't destroy any infrastructure if a pandemic occurs, so they could keep all their police day infrastructure in place and still have the mass panic required.
[01:28:21.742 --> 01:28:28.524]  That's why it would be so much more easy to control than, say, a nuke in Chicago or something like that.
[01:28:28.544 --> 01:28:34.945]  It's much more easy to control the spread of it because, I mean, everyone said it's difficult to transmit to humans anyway.
[01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:38.804]  Well, it's gotta come from the vicious duck.
[01:28:38.904 --> 01:28:40.166]  It can't come from a human yet.
[01:28:40.386 --> 01:28:41.107]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:41.127 --> 01:28:41.568]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.872 --> 01:28:44.753]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.254 --> 01:28:46.876]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.778 --> 01:28:50.462]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.235 --> 01:28:57.037]  Let's face it, we know that we're less than perfect when it comes to our diets.
[01:28:57.157 --> 01:29:02.220]  We all eat sugar, saturated fats, salt, probably don't get the exercise we should, and we all have to deal with daily stress.
[01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:08.623]  And all the vitamins and supplements in the world won't help you if your immune system is compromised because of our less than perfect eating habits and lifestyles.
[01:29:08.904 --> 01:29:14.547]  That's why Agaricus Bio is the number one dietary supplement that you should consider an absolute must if you're going to take any at all.
[01:29:14.807 --> 01:29:20.311]  The immune system is your body's first line of defense against disease, and Agaricus Bio strengthens and supports your immune system.
[01:29:20.552 --> 01:29:24.395]  That's why it's become the most popular immune support system for people and pets in Japan.
[01:29:24.415 --> 01:29:29.699]  A one-month supply of Agaricus Bio is only $34.95, and that's a small price to pay considering the alternatives.

[01:30:12.299 --> 01:30:14.101]  Yet require very little energy.
[01:30:14.361 --> 01:30:17.683]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[01:30:18.024 --> 01:30:19.365]  But it's worth every penny.
[01:30:19.505 --> 01:30:28.472]  Because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[01:30:28.772 --> 01:30:29.272]  That's right!

[01:31:57.312 --> 01:32:01.194]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:04.176 --> 01:32:09.600]  Waging war on corruption, Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:11.241]  Thank you again for joining us today.
[01:32:12.222 --> 01:32:13.603]  And look, we're the majority.
[01:32:15.044 --> 01:32:20.007]  90 plus percent are against transponder-tracked toll roads on existing roads.
[01:32:20.983 --> 01:32:28.288]  80-plus percent in England, 90-plus percent are against national ID cards through the state and shire and county IDs.
[01:32:28.989 --> 01:32:29.970]  Government still does it.
[01:32:29.990 --> 01:32:38.756]  90-plus percent, it was in the high 90s, were against the new Freedom Initiative for psychological testing and drugging of every school-aged child in America.
[01:32:39.276 --> 01:32:40.177]  From 4 to 18.
[01:32:41.077 --> 01:32:44.820]  By law, now, even to be pregnant mothers in Illinois, they still do it.
[01:32:46.407 --> 01:32:48.249]  Almost everyone is against the national draft.
[01:32:48.269 --> 01:32:58.938]  They're still quietly setting up the draft boards, introducing bills, trying to get everybody prepared for it, keeping troops who have already been in for two, three, four tours, making them stay in.
[01:32:59.878 --> 01:33:03.782]  Over and over and over again, they're doing the opposite of what we want.
[01:33:03.962 --> 01:33:09.046]  Look, I still hear talk shows every day on the radio going, why is the gas price so high?
[01:33:09.446 --> 01:33:10.407]  Is there a scam?
[01:33:11.008 --> 01:33:11.808]  Is there a scam?
[01:33:11.828 --> 01:33:13.830]  We have the oil company's own memos!
[01:33:15.331 --> 01:33:29.802]  Almost 10 years where they collude to buy up and shut down refineries and restrict the size of their own refineries and cut back their production and they say to artificially bottleneck the overabundance of oil.
[01:33:32.084 --> 01:33:33.105]  None of this is secret.
[01:33:34.056 --> 01:33:39.800]  We said the Globalists carried out 9-11, we have their own battle plan, Operation Northwoods, calling for doing exactly what happened.
[01:33:40.821 --> 01:33:45.844]  Over and over again, we just research the facts of life, the way the world's operating.
[01:33:45.904 --> 01:33:47.085]  None of this is that hard!
[01:33:48.206 --> 01:33:49.447]  You've just got to get into it.
[01:33:49.487 --> 01:33:52.509]  Paul, comments on what I just stated, and then let's take some calls.
[01:33:54.831 --> 01:34:00.975]  It doesn't matter how many people oppose any kind of policy, because we've got the CIA running electronic voting machines anyway.
[01:34:01.730 --> 01:34:08.232]  And they don't care how many people oppose their policy because, as they've said, they create their own reality.
[01:34:08.272 --> 01:34:10.073]  They live in their own bubble.
[01:34:10.253 --> 01:34:11.894]  Bush doesn't read the newspapers.
[01:34:12.474 --> 01:34:14.735]  His advisors tell him what's going on in the world.
[01:34:15.515 --> 01:34:20.397]  He's living in the Truman Show, basically, so they don't care what the people think because they don't represent us.
[01:34:21.642 --> 01:34:23.482]  And you know, that really is a big problem.
[01:34:24.043 --> 01:34:32.224]  They know, the architects, the controllers of this system, they know that the only out will be rioting, shooting, violence.
[01:34:32.924 --> 01:34:34.365]  They see that as our only out.
[01:34:34.385 --> 01:34:35.525]  I don't believe that's our only out.
[01:34:35.805 --> 01:34:40.106]  So that's why they've been massively gearing up against us for the past decade.
[01:34:41.406 --> 01:34:41.986]  Well, that's right.
[01:34:42.026 --> 01:34:44.027]  And there's another example of that today.
[01:34:45.227 --> 01:34:49.408]  In Britain, again, as in Australia, they've got these terror laws on the table.
[01:34:50.012 --> 01:34:53.053]  And what does Ian Blair, the police chief, come out and announce?
[01:34:53.313 --> 01:34:58.535]  That they've prevented terrorist attacks, but there are more attempted attacks in the pipeline.
[01:34:58.995 --> 01:34:59.815]  Which is blatant.
[01:34:59.835 --> 01:35:06.557]  He's basically saying, look, we've been nice to you so far, we've kept the wolf on the door, but if you don't let us have our way, we're going to stick him on you.
[01:35:07.237 --> 01:35:13.599]  It's like the old mafia analogy that you use, you know, pay us the protection money or our friend Luigi will torch your business.
[01:35:14.187 --> 01:35:17.150]  So they're still using basic intimidation tactics.
[01:35:17.290 --> 01:35:19.492]  They're not shifting terms on the tactics they use.
[01:35:19.893 --> 01:35:22.435]  Oh, I knew that there was something I was forgetting, Paul.
[01:35:22.455 --> 01:35:24.717]  And if you can, get up on your telephone for me.
[01:35:24.737 --> 01:35:25.838]  You're backing off a little bit.
[01:35:25.858 --> 01:35:26.619]  I'm having trouble hearing you.
[01:35:29.893 --> 01:35:33.536]  Before we get into the new evidence, just one more little piece here.
[01:35:33.556 --> 01:35:36.298]  It's like a little nut you sprinkle on the sundae.
[01:35:36.318 --> 01:35:40.922]  I mean, it doesn't even equate to the cherry, but it does add into this whole picture.
[01:35:40.942 --> 01:35:49.049]  And then it does tie in with the Al-Qaeda terrorists for six months, running around with a CIA telephone, making all their phone calls.
[01:35:49.069 --> 01:35:50.991]  And then they get caught, and the government tries to spin it.
[01:35:51.331 --> 01:35:54.394]  But before we get into all that, let's recap briefly, and then we'll go to your calls.
[01:35:55.354 --> 01:36:01.557]  What we know about the London bombings, I mean that's a slam-dunk government op, and then tell folks the new little tidbit.
[01:36:03.098 --> 01:36:21.626]  Well, to go with the new thing first, basically Metropolitan Police actually gave a seminar where one of the discussion points focused around the fact that none of the so-called suicide bombers fitted the profile of terrorist, and that their behavior as filmed on the day of the attacks was totally unlike a terrorist would act.
[01:36:22.536 --> 01:36:30.927]  First he talks about how odd it is for a terrorist to make a public scene by arguing with a cashier about being short-changed, as happened.
[01:36:31.868 --> 01:36:33.029]  What does that remind us of?
[01:36:33.069 --> 01:36:37.575]  The hijacker who had a blazing row at the airport over his rental car right before 9-11?
[01:36:39.108 --> 01:36:45.450]  Um, the spokesman's quote was, quote, Tanweer also played a game of cricket the night before he travelled down to London.
[01:36:45.810 --> 01:36:49.471]  Now are these the actions of someone who is going to blow themselves up the next day?
[01:36:49.891 --> 01:36:52.592]  I've seen the CCTV footage of these people.
[01:36:52.932 --> 01:36:56.173]  They do not appear to be on their way to commit any crime at all.
[01:36:56.573 --> 01:37:04.595]  The Russell Square bomber, Hasib Hussain, is actually seen going into shops and bumping into people prior to his attack, the expert said.
[01:37:05.256 --> 01:37:11.860]  So on the back of this, again, we've put out another compilation of the evidence that these guys had no idea what they were part of.
[01:37:12.020 --> 01:37:20.965]  And by the way, by the way, a lot of different criminologists in England, in Germany, in the US, right after it happened, saw the footage and said, they're not acting like criminals.
[01:37:21.165 --> 01:37:24.527]  There's body language, folks, especially when you're about to kill yourself.
[01:37:25.134 --> 01:37:31.761]  No, we have footage of other suicide bombers and their eyes are bugging out of their heads, they're sweating, they're hyperventilating, they're chanting.
[01:37:32.101 --> 01:37:38.048]  You know, these guys are out playing cricket, laughing, having a good time, on the cell phone waving, you know, waddling about.
[01:37:38.328 --> 01:37:45.576]  And then we have the police and we have witnesses and we have workers and we have drivers that the bombs were being blown up from beneath the trains.
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:56.105]  Yep, all the bombers had round-trip tickets from Luton to London and back again, so they'd also paid for long-term parking in Luton.
[01:37:56.145 --> 01:37:57.906]  They expected to come back.
[01:37:58.206 --> 01:38:06.390]  And we also have a SWAT who's been fingered by the FBI as one of the top Al-Qaeda members back in the mid-90s.
[01:38:06.791 --> 01:38:08.832]  And the British government, it turns out, he's MI6.
[01:38:08.852 --> 01:38:10.273]  They've been paying him and protecting him.
[01:38:10.433 --> 01:38:11.453]  This is not even debatable.
[01:38:11.613 --> 01:38:16.436]  He's the guy making calls to quote all of the bombers on both events.
[01:38:17.016 --> 01:38:18.977]  On the 7th and then on the 21st.
[01:38:19.017 --> 01:38:30.962]  Well, yeah, he's actually trying to set up a terrorist training school in Oregon in 1999 and the Justice Department told the Seattle prosecutors to back off and to leave him alone.
[01:38:31.482 --> 01:38:34.723]  And then we're told he's the so-called mastermind behind the London bombings.
[01:38:35.304 --> 01:38:39.025]  And then Scotland Yard says, whoops, our mistake, he wasn't the mastermind.
[01:38:39.065 --> 01:38:40.486]  After it turned out he was linked to MI6.
[01:38:42.066 --> 01:38:51.294]  Um, with the bombing itself, there's no suicide notes or videotape messages until after the bombing where this video is discovered with one of the bombers talking about the bombing.
[01:38:51.314 --> 01:38:54.297]  They asked the family members about the tape and they all said it was faked.
[01:38:55.057 --> 01:38:56.038]  Well, it's worse than that.
[01:38:56.078 --> 01:39:00.702]  We have a drill at the exact same locations, exact same place, exact same time.
[01:39:01.002 --> 01:39:03.625]  You can't even pronounce the number, folks, the chance, okay?
[01:39:04.385 --> 01:39:07.888]  And, I mean, it's just got 48 zeros on it.
[01:39:08.548 --> 01:39:11.030]  That this would happen just by a 10 year meme.
[01:39:11.350 --> 01:39:15.093]  We could have done a universal meme and it would have been a number bigger than any number ever known.
[01:39:15.113 --> 01:39:20.977]  I mean, this is insane and we always have these exact same drills at the exact same time, Paul, to be a cover.
[01:39:22.258 --> 01:39:22.798]  Exactly.
[01:39:23.159 --> 01:39:26.101]  And the behavior of the bombers themselves.
[01:39:26.641 --> 01:39:31.885]  They were called happy hikers by one policeman after seeing the CCTV cameras.
[01:39:32.603 --> 01:39:37.167]  They all left their personal documents at the exact locations of the bomb site.
[01:39:37.307 --> 01:39:43.691]  Oh, but then the Feds screwed up, MI6 screwed up and left one guy's IDs at two separate bombing locations.
[01:39:44.152 --> 01:39:44.392]  Yeah.
[01:39:45.173 --> 01:39:54.339]  So it's just like the passport that floated down from the World Trade Center on 9-11 and the passport found in a Pennsylvania debris field which was 8 miles wide on 9-11.
[01:39:55.931 --> 01:40:04.203]  Um, the so-called Bus Bomber, a jihadist and hater of all things western, stopped off for a Big Mac at McDonald's before blowing himself up.
[01:40:04.263 --> 01:40:06.786]  Again, not the profile of a terrorist.
[01:40:07.708 --> 01:40:12.855]  Um, they said the final word basically on the bombings was that they were synchronized attacks.
[01:40:13.773 --> 01:40:29.644]  Um, that wasn't known until about five days after the bombings, but for some reason, the Israeli Mossad knew it within hours of the bombings, which is how they were able to warn Benjamin Netanyahu not to leave his hotel to go to a site near one of the bombings in Liverpool Street.
[01:40:29.684 --> 01:40:34.127]  And that was in the Associated Press, then they tried to deny it, but then, guess what?
[01:40:34.187 --> 01:40:38.330]  Mossad confirmed it in the major German papers in a sit-down TV interview.
[01:40:38.690 --> 01:40:41.292]  The head of Mossad said, yes, we gave him, uh, what?
[01:40:42.212 --> 01:40:43.433]  A eight-minute warning, wasn't it?
[01:40:44.393 --> 01:40:56.759]  Yeah, they confirmed it and then it was in the Jerusalem Post that the government had told all the Mossad agents to shut up about it and if asked any information about the London bombings just to not respond.
[01:40:57.239 --> 01:40:58.620]  That was in the Jerusalem Post.
[01:40:59.535 --> 01:41:01.738]  And literally, folks, there are about 100 other points.
[01:41:01.758 --> 01:41:02.599]  Well, there's more than that.
[01:41:02.619 --> 01:41:05.922]  I mean, we probably wrote 30 articles on this, each article dozens of points.
[01:41:06.443 --> 01:41:07.224]  There's no way to go through.
[01:41:07.264 --> 01:41:08.665]  It would take three hours to do.
[01:41:08.825 --> 01:41:09.887]  I'm making a film about it.
[01:41:10.688 --> 01:41:12.790]  But it just never ends.
[01:41:12.850 --> 01:41:13.631]  And now we catch...
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:31.028]  Brits, MI6's military arm, SAS Special Air Services, the British precursor to Delta Force, these elite guys dressed up like Muslims, running around shooting people, full of a car full of suicide bombs, and we've caught Israelis doing the same thing.
[01:41:31.128 --> 01:41:32.469]  I mean, it just never ends, Paul!
[01:41:33.589 --> 01:41:40.453]  Yeah, and in a lot of the kidnapping cases, the victims reported that they were abducted by white men in suits.
[01:41:42.481 --> 01:41:48.566]  That was the case with Ken Bigley, I think, and the female Italian that got kidnapped as well.
[01:41:48.706 --> 01:42:00.476]  Paul, I want you to think about this hard, and this is the last question we will go to Ian and Sharon and everybody else that's patiently holding, Scott and others, because I think about this all the time.
[01:42:00.796 --> 01:42:03.018]  Why psychologically are they doing it on purpose?
[01:42:03.038 --> 01:42:05.000]  Because I know the Zarqawi thing is on purpose.
[01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:07.382]  I mean, it's now finally something we reported on
[01:42:08.050 --> 01:42:28.995]  Two years ago, literally two years ago folks, you can go read the articles on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com, now it's all over daily show, it's on CNN, it's in major publications, that Zakari's been killed dozens of times and captured dozens of times, and his lieutenants have been captured and killed dozens of times, and they kill a number two guy every five days on average.
[01:42:29.235 --> 01:42:34.976]  I mean now, why are they on purpose saying they kill him over and over again and capture him, but never even
[01:42:35.556 --> 01:42:40.080]  I don't know if it's on purpose, but each time, for example, Al Zarqawi is killed, you know, it gets reported in foreign newspapers and stuff,
[01:43:03.439 --> 01:43:10.269]  The Pentagon just doesn't respond to it and then, you know, a few months later they'll kill, they'll capture somebody else who's supposedly being killed.
[01:43:10.730 --> 01:43:14.315]  And there's just no reference or mention of the previous news story.
[01:43:15.156 --> 01:43:16.859]  So I don't know what's going on, I mean...
[01:43:18.299 --> 01:43:28.063]  The case with the number three Al-Qaeda guy, it turned out that he was a totally different guy with a similar name and the original Al-Qaeda number three in Iraq is still out there.
[01:43:28.243 --> 01:43:29.963]  There was no reproduction of that either.
[01:43:30.343 --> 01:43:42.227]  Exactly, but there's also been a couple of different events where they stage arrest of CIA operatives who they say have been carrying out terror and then it's a minor footnote a month later, oh he was really CIA, they were protecting his anonymity.
[01:43:43.228 --> 01:43:46.689]  Well they actually got in a bit of a pickle over one of them because they
[01:43:47.495 --> 01:43:51.896]  Supposedly captured a top Al-Qaeda commander and then it was
[01:43:53.596 --> 01:44:15.022]  Moussaoui in his trial that called this same guy to give testimony in his trial and the Pentagon basically for two years said no because they hadn't captured him and the evidence came out that he was still out there but they had earlier put out this fake story that had been captured when he was called to trial they said no because they hadn't actually got him.
[01:44:15.422 --> 01:44:20.844]  I heard a neocon on with Harry Brown's great radio show on Genesis on Saturday nights and I had to call in
[01:44:21.952 --> 01:44:24.576]  And, uh, this Neocon had been a former staffer of Ron Paul.
[01:44:24.596 --> 01:44:25.978]  He was on there attacking Ron Paul, too.
[01:44:25.998 --> 01:44:26.799]  It was disgusting.
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:34.450]  And, uh, I called in, and this guy was literally saying, we found a chemical weapons laboratory in northern Iraq.
[01:44:34.490 --> 01:44:35.892]  We found the 747 for the training.
[01:44:37.176 --> 01:44:38.937]  And, of course, all that came out days after.
[01:44:38.997 --> 01:44:39.718]  It was a bakery.
[01:44:40.178 --> 01:44:40.819]  Troops went there.
[01:44:40.839 --> 01:44:43.181]  It turned out that that jet wasn't a terrorist training camp.
[01:44:43.501 --> 01:44:44.402]  It was a private airport.
[01:44:44.682 --> 01:44:45.843]  You know, they just lie.
[01:44:46.003 --> 01:44:47.224]  It was some junk sitting there.
[01:44:47.824 --> 01:44:48.905]  That's all over the U.S., too.
[01:44:48.945 --> 01:44:51.587]  All over Europe, you know, these junk planes sitting out by old airports.
[01:44:52.047 --> 01:44:53.969]  So, it just never ends, Paul.
[01:44:54.409 --> 01:44:57.832]  But these neocons are still on the radio quoting the same bull.
[01:44:58.846 --> 01:45:03.270]  Well, it's like the bioweapon trucks that turned out to be for blowing up helium.
[01:45:03.871 --> 01:45:05.392]  That came out a couple of weeks later.
[01:45:05.412 --> 01:45:08.495]  It was totally discredited in all the big British newspapers.
[01:45:09.275 --> 01:45:11.197]  And yeah, I still hear them talking about it.
[01:45:11.217 --> 01:45:13.139]  The weapons of mass destruction were found.
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.981]  Um, so that's all they do.
[01:45:17.341 --> 01:45:20.522]  These were British made for pumping up surveillance blimps.
[01:45:21.382 --> 01:45:22.622]  British made with the serial numbers.
[01:45:22.742 --> 01:45:24.303]  Our troops knew day one.
[01:45:24.743 --> 01:45:26.183]  It was even British troops that liberated it.
[01:45:26.643 --> 01:45:28.304]  They knew exactly what this was.
[01:45:28.444 --> 01:45:31.065]  This is a piece of our equipment in the weapons dictionary.
[01:45:32.125 --> 01:45:33.885]  It isn't like the weapons encyclopedia.
[01:45:34.165 --> 01:45:34.966]  Let's take calls here.
[01:45:34.986 --> 01:45:35.946]  People have been holding long enough.
[01:45:36.166 --> 01:45:38.687]  Let's talk to Ian in Ontario, then Sharon and others.
[01:45:39.167 --> 01:45:40.087]  Go ahead Ian, you're on the air.
[01:45:40.687 --> 01:45:41.829]  Hi Alex, can you hear me?
[01:45:42.129 --> 01:45:43.050]  Loud and clear, brother.
[01:45:43.570 --> 01:45:47.354]  You're coming in very clear in your new facilities on the shortwave.
[01:45:48.676 --> 01:45:57.245]  This morning there was a rather ominous story as the last item on the CBC Radio News World Report, and that was that Iran today
[01:45:57.950 --> 01:46:01.232]  As recalled some 20 of its overseas ambassadors.
[01:46:01.712 --> 01:46:10.536]  The CBC radio spin on this was that this was just a hardline Iranian administration removing liberal elements in the diplomatic corps.
[01:46:10.576 --> 01:46:13.417]  But even by the western partisan political dynamic,
[01:46:13.917 --> 01:46:16.440]  It doesn't make sense to make a move like this.
[01:46:17.241 --> 01:46:19.283]  Well, let me just tell you, I'm going to give you the background.
[01:46:19.303 --> 01:46:20.824]  I'm sure you already know this, showing a smart guy.
[01:46:20.844 --> 01:46:23.327]  I'm not trying to jump in on you, but this is important.
[01:46:23.667 --> 01:46:26.330]  Number one, Israel said they may attack him any day.
[01:46:26.850 --> 01:46:30.253]  Number two, our own government said they may, and there's been a major gear up.
[01:46:30.694 --> 01:46:33.937]  Number three, they're starting enrichment today.
[01:46:34.378 --> 01:46:37.421]  They have announced two days ago they're going to start enrichment today.
[01:46:38.181 --> 01:46:39.982]  And that was one other point I was going to make.
[01:46:40.763 --> 01:46:47.047]  Oh, and Iran now has gotten more hardline, saying they want to destroy Israel and knock it off the map.
[01:46:47.367 --> 01:46:49.508]  So they're escalating and they're saying, let's get it on.
[01:46:50.509 --> 01:46:54.131]  This is a very, very serious escalation.
[01:46:55.046 --> 01:46:59.933]  And I think they've gotten intel from sources I have that they're going to be attacked anyway, and they're just ready to go.
[01:46:59.953 --> 01:47:00.634]  They're ready to rock.
[01:47:00.674 --> 01:47:02.356]  But that's the background I wanted, Alex.
[01:47:02.376 --> 01:47:08.224]  Does Paul Joseph Watson, with his seven-hour lead, have anything to contribute to this story?
[01:47:09.426 --> 01:47:09.827]  Well, yeah.
[01:47:09.987 --> 01:47:12.050]  As Alex said, they know they're going to be attacked.
[01:47:12.751 --> 01:47:20.937]  What we should fear most is the response of Russia, because they've not only got financial investment in those reactors, but a geopolitical one as well.
[01:47:21.417 --> 01:47:24.539]  And all along the line, Russia have defended Iran.
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:28.762]  In recent weeks, there was speculation that Russia were backing away.
[01:47:28.782 --> 01:47:36.307]  I don't really believe that for a second, so that's the true escalation when Russia and China get involved, but obviously Iran doesn't care anymore.
[01:47:36.327 --> 01:47:39.029]  Well, Russia was in the UN yesterday saying they back up Iran.
[01:47:39.389 --> 01:47:39.850]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:47:40.511 --> 01:47:43.237]  Okay, you guys, who do you think is going to move first?
[01:47:43.879 --> 01:47:46.225]  The Anglo-American Alliance or Iran?
[01:47:47.433 --> 01:47:49.055]  Oh, I don't think Iran is going to move first.
[01:47:49.095 --> 01:47:54.599]  I think the globalists, as so many congressmen and CIA analysts have said, are going to carry out an event.
[01:47:54.639 --> 01:48:10.352]  Listen, three days after we told Iran, we wrote an article to Iran, and we're not tooting our horn, folks, we get millions of readers a day, and we said, you better go public about our government being behind the terror, or they're going to do it and blame it on you, and then the top government official came out,
[01:48:11.132 --> 01:48:14.813]  Along with the top Mullah and said, yes, the US may carry out an attack and blame it on us.
[01:48:15.054 --> 01:48:16.234]  That's the last thing we'll do.
[01:48:16.474 --> 01:48:17.054]  We're peaceful.
[01:48:17.094 --> 01:48:17.875]  We don't want to fight.
[01:48:18.095 --> 01:48:19.555]  We've bent over for the UN.
[01:48:20.055 --> 01:48:21.396]  There's nothing weaponized here.
[01:48:21.416 --> 01:48:23.076]  Your own CIA says 10 years.
[01:48:23.517 --> 01:48:24.357]  We're tired of it.
[01:48:24.377 --> 01:48:27.818]  And again, I'm not saying Iran's perfect, folks, but our government created this.
[01:48:27.858 --> 01:48:31.519]  They removed Mosaddegh, who was our friend, who was free market, who was good.
[01:48:31.859 --> 01:48:33.960]  They carried out terror attacks and blamed it on him.
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:38.742]  In 1953, they caused the Ayatollah Khomeini to come in after the abuse of Shah.
[01:48:39.799 --> 01:48:43.300]  And, you know, this is... Iran isn't bothering anybody, folks.
[01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:48.801]  The reason we're pushing all these people around is because they are more of a pushover than China or North Korea.
[01:48:49.001 --> 01:48:51.821]  This is nothing but bullying and thieving and stealing.
[01:48:52.221 --> 01:49:01.983]  And a lot of you good old boys sitting in your easy chairs that want to kill some Arabs or kill some Persians, you better figure out geopolitical systems and realize this is going to hurt us, folks.
[01:49:02.183 --> 01:49:03.763]  This is not good for any of our children.
[01:49:03.983 --> 01:49:05.103]  It's not good for America.
[01:49:05.303 --> 01:49:09.044]  Since when did America stomp around everywhere attacking everybody?
[01:49:10.162 --> 01:49:14.123]  Do you think that the Americans are going to move against Iran?
[01:49:14.483 --> 01:49:15.343]  I don't know what's going on.
[01:49:15.503 --> 01:49:21.384]  Listen, it could be that they're pulling in ambassadors because they think there's spies in their ambassador corps.
[01:49:21.744 --> 01:49:22.744]  That's done routinely.
[01:49:22.984 --> 01:49:28.085]  But, you know, the last time, you know, the Japanese pulled their ambassadors five days before Pearl Harbor.
[01:49:28.406 --> 01:49:31.746]  I don't know what's going to happen, but we know a lot of things are coming to a head right now.
[01:49:31.766 --> 01:49:35.827]  We're at a crossroads, a zenith, a flashpoint, a critical mash.
[01:49:36.568 --> 01:49:38.830]  We're at a very, very serious point right now.
[01:49:39.311 --> 01:49:41.493]  And we'll comment more on this on the other side.
[01:49:41.513 --> 01:49:45.658]  And then we'll continue with Sharon and Scott and many others.
[01:49:45.698 --> 01:49:49.022]  Call for your number to join us.
[01:49:49.042 --> 01:49:49.302]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:49:49.543 --> 01:49:51.385]  Paul Joseph Watson riding shotgun with us.
[01:49:51.445 --> 01:49:53.027]  I'm Alex Jones for Earth and Planet.TV.
[01:49:53.647 --> 01:49:54.168]  Hey, folks!
[01:49:54.268 --> 01:50:00.492]  Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:00.792 --> 01:50:02.153]  That's right, folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.353 --> 01:50:04.574]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:04.715 --> 01:50:06.796]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:07.076 --> 01:50:11.999]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:16.402]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:16.643 --> 01:50:18.404]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:18.504 --> 01:50:22.867]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare U.N.
[01:50:22.887 --> 01:50:23.387]  population
[01:50:23.387 --> 01:50:23.967]  We're good.
[01:50:52.972 --> 01:50:54.954]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[01:50:55.034 --> 01:51:05.762]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:51:06.142 --> 01:51:10.646]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:51:10.726 --> 01:51:22.055]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:51:22.635 --> 01:51:29.477]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:51:29.877 --> 01:51:32.017]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:51:32.497 --> 01:51:37.478]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post-filter elements.
[01:51:37.778 --> 01:51:43.920]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-9000.
[01:51:45.320 --> 01:52:00.806]  Erbol Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:52:01.026 --> 01:52:03.287]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:52:03.467 --> 01:52:09.809]  We provide outstanding products like ECAC, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:52:10.209 --> 01:52:10.810]  I think so.
[01:52:30.373 --> 01:52:30.893]  We're good to go!
[01:52:59.907 --> 01:53:02.949]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest.
[01:53:03.509 --> 01:53:06.150]  A gun on my hip and the right to arrest.
[01:53:06.270 --> 01:53:09.551]  I'm the guy who's the boss on this highway.
[01:53:09.771 --> 01:53:12.512]  So watch out what you're doing when you're driving my way.
[01:53:12.833 --> 01:53:15.894]  If you break the law, you'll hear from me I know.
[01:53:15.914 --> 01:53:18.815]  I'm working for the state, I'm the highway patrol.
[01:53:18.855 --> 01:53:20.316]  Yeah, I'm pretty good.
[01:53:22.296 --> 01:53:34.200]  A big study just came out in England about how some of the highest levels of criminality are found in the police, major government think tank, slash private think tank, and how the government looks for criminals.
[01:53:34.360 --> 01:53:34.841]  Exactly.
[01:53:34.901 --> 01:53:41.603]  If you're in East Germany, or you're in Communist Russia or China, or you're in any corrupt regime, you look for criminals.
[01:53:42.381 --> 01:53:47.386]  And so they're weeding out the good cops worldwide and putting in men that will eat your guts and ask for seconds.
[01:53:47.946 --> 01:53:49.107]  It'll break your family up.
[01:53:49.147 --> 01:53:50.228]  It'll knock your teeth out.
[01:53:50.288 --> 01:53:51.269]  It'll take your guns.
[01:53:52.770 --> 01:53:56.614]  And our answer to all that tyranny is the Second Amendment, which is an insurance policy.
[01:53:56.874 --> 01:53:58.375]  Some good news on the Second Amendment coming up.
[01:53:58.395 --> 01:54:01.859]  We're about to go to Sharon here in just a moment.
[01:54:02.199 --> 01:54:04.761]  But before I do that, folks, we've got a bunch of new specials.

[01:54:39.816 --> 01:54:40.796]  Well, one is three hours long.
[01:54:40.816 --> 01:54:41.536]  The other is almost three.
[01:54:41.556 --> 01:54:43.877]  The other is two hours long.
[01:54:43.957 --> 01:54:44.257]  For $44.95.

[01:54:46.738 --> 01:54:47.958]  Those are the top of specials.

[01:55:49.086 --> 01:55:50.367]  You can't see me at the old office.
[01:55:50.387 --> 01:55:51.167]  You never could see me.
[01:55:51.187 --> 01:55:52.268]  It's a mail drop-off spot.
[01:55:52.528 --> 01:55:54.509]  But I will be physical here very, very soon for you.
[01:55:55.050 --> 01:55:57.211]  So please take action and get the films and get them out to people.
[01:55:57.852 --> 01:56:00.453]  Sharon in Florida, thank you for holding like a real trooper.
[01:56:00.714 --> 01:56:02.695]  You're on the air, Sharon, with Paul Watson.
[01:56:03.095 --> 01:56:03.575]  Yeah, hi.
[01:56:03.716 --> 01:56:07.878]  I just wanted to let y'all know, were you aware of what happened last night in the house?
[01:56:08.639 --> 01:56:10.140]  Our whole government about came down.
[01:56:11.221 --> 01:56:13.202]  They were telling about all the lies
[01:56:13.769 --> 01:56:15.349]  They were talking about all the corruption.
[01:56:15.789 --> 01:56:16.890]  Both sides were at it.
[01:56:17.710 --> 01:56:20.571]  And I mean, they were totally fed up with it all.
[01:56:21.311 --> 01:56:24.471]  Well, what you have is they're fighting with each other with their own slop.
[01:56:24.791 --> 01:56:25.091]  Well, no.
[01:56:25.132 --> 01:56:26.272]  I mean, not fighting with each other.
[01:56:26.472 --> 01:56:28.352]  They were all attacking the administration.
[01:56:29.472 --> 01:56:30.173]  Not each other.
[01:56:30.193 --> 01:56:31.133]  The administration.
[01:56:31.293 --> 01:56:35.114]  Well, I did talk about that in the first 15 minutes, but I've got a clip.
[01:56:35.274 --> 01:56:36.274]  I've got two news clips.
[01:56:36.394 --> 01:56:40.375]  I'm going to play those, and we're going to talk about... It's great.
[01:56:40.435 --> 01:56:40.835]  It really is.
[01:56:43.780 --> 01:56:49.262]  No, it is at a certain level, but... Paul, why don't you explain to her the birdcage liner effect?
[01:56:50.462 --> 01:56:50.902]  Well, yes.
[01:56:51.503 --> 01:56:58.205]  You remember back in June, down in Street Memo, everybody was saying that would bring the Bush administration down.
[01:56:58.245 --> 01:57:04.847]  You had a bunch of Democrats packed into this tiny room, and that was the supposed frontier of bringing the government down.
[01:57:05.347 --> 01:57:06.808]  Same with this indictment thing.
[01:57:06.848 --> 01:57:07.508]  They burned
[01:57:08.687 --> 01:57:13.372]  Some little minion like Scooter Libby, um, Roald's still under investigation.
[01:57:13.892 --> 01:57:18.196]  And I don't, I hate to be pessimistic, but I don't really think it's going anywhere.
[01:57:18.216 --> 01:57:19.357]  It's a distraction.
[01:57:19.437 --> 01:57:22.741]  Well, even if they do, Bush and his people are mid-level minions, folks.
[01:57:23.101 --> 01:57:25.783]  And then this all makes us feel good, and ooh, we're in there fighting them.
[01:57:26.104 --> 01:57:27.605]  Tell you what, stay there.
[01:57:28.486 --> 01:57:30.027]  No, we'll come back to you.
[01:57:30.228 --> 01:57:31.629]  We're starting the third hour right now.

[01:57:38.610 --> 01:57:39.370]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:39.530 --> 01:57:42.451]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:42.611 --> 01:57:47.773]  You want answers?
[01:57:48.133 --> 01:57:49.073]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.854 --> 01:58:01.857]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.037 --> 01:58:06.160]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:14.145 --> 01:58:16.487]  This is why I love to take calls.
[01:58:17.327 --> 01:58:22.991]  Because callers will bring up news items that we've just mentioned, or haven't even covered, that are so important.
[01:58:23.846 --> 01:58:26.787]  And for the last two hours, I was like, you know, there's something I'm not covering.
[01:58:26.807 --> 01:58:27.928]  There's something I'm not talking about.
[01:58:28.188 --> 01:58:29.628]  You know, I mentioned it at the first of the show.
[01:58:29.648 --> 01:58:33.570]  Senate Democrats forced closed-door session.
[01:58:34.050 --> 01:58:38.332]  Deals struck to advance investigation over pre-war intelligence.
[01:58:39.606 --> 01:58:43.108]  And that just means that they'll use us as a political football to score points.
[01:58:43.168 --> 01:58:49.512]  And the very people involved in it, in the war, in the lies, like Schumer and others, are now going to be running the investigation.
[01:58:49.552 --> 01:59:01.858]  Which, again, makes us all feel good, and we get to keep all the oil, and destroy the country, and have hundreds of billions in weapons sales, and run the scam, but we're going to make Bush look bad, and so we'll all feel good.
[01:59:02.719 --> 01:59:07.041]  Meanwhile, the big global corporations that did it all, scapes got free.
[01:59:07.101 --> 01:59:08.322]  So this is a scapegoat.
[01:59:09.179 --> 01:59:11.281]  As much as I can't stand Bush, he's just a scapegoat.
[01:59:11.621 --> 01:59:17.485]  Yeah, he should go to prison, they should all go to prison, but so should the corporations that lobbied them and that write the policies for them.
[01:59:17.525 --> 01:59:18.766]  Paul Watson, comments on that?
[01:59:20.147 --> 01:59:20.828]  Well, that's right.
[01:59:20.848 --> 01:59:25.471]  I think the very least thing it does with the indictments, with the Downing Street memo,
[01:59:26.782 --> 01:59:28.464]  It's a spotlight on their behavior.
[01:59:28.484 --> 01:59:38.213]  It prevents them from escalating their criminality, which I think is a big reason why there hasn't been any staged provocations since 9-11 in the U.S.
[01:59:38.413 --> 01:59:40.035]  because they're like cockroaches.
[01:59:40.055 --> 01:59:42.157]  You shine the light on them and they scutter away.
[01:59:42.637 --> 01:59:46.521]  I think they were surprised by the fact that we've been so bold exposing their operation.
[01:59:47.617 --> 01:59:52.822]  Yeah, me too, but the question of whether anyone's bringing the government down.
[01:59:52.842 --> 01:59:54.603]  I mean, they survived Abu Ghraib.
[01:59:55.164 --> 01:59:59.868]  Rumsfeld has been supposedly about to resign about five times over the past four years.
[01:59:59.928 --> 02:00:00.728]  It hasn't happened.
[02:00:00.748 --> 02:00:04.191]  I think only the people of conscience ever resign.
[02:00:04.211 --> 02:00:07.254]  Rumsfeld doesn't have any conscience.
[02:00:07.274 --> 02:00:11.478]  They won't resign on that basis and most of them will stay in as long as they can.
[02:00:13.067 --> 02:00:13.767]  Absolutely.
[02:00:14.468 --> 02:00:16.988]  Going back to the caller, if she's still there.
[02:00:17.088 --> 02:00:20.309]  Sharon, do you agree with what we're saying or do you disagree?
[02:00:20.349 --> 02:00:20.850]  Yes, I do.
[02:00:21.070 --> 02:00:28.612]  And like last night, one of the reps, Barton, I think from Ohio, I mean, he actually, I mean, attacked you, Debbie.
[02:00:28.652 --> 02:00:37.135]  He said, you're not going to get any help with any stopping any litigation against these pharmaceutical companies until you stop all this poisoning of everybody.
[02:00:38.007 --> 02:00:39.968]  I mean, I was just jumping up and down.
[02:00:40.929 --> 02:00:43.671]  Wow, I hope somebody will send me video of that debate.
[02:00:43.691 --> 02:00:44.872]  It was in the house last night.
[02:00:45.493 --> 02:00:51.337]  And so it was being brought up that we can't give liability protection because this stuff is poison?
[02:00:51.537 --> 02:00:52.017]  That's right.
[02:00:52.217 --> 02:00:53.058]  Wow, who said that?
[02:00:53.078 --> 02:00:54.799]  It was, I think, Rod Barton.
[02:00:56.440 --> 02:00:57.321]  From Ohio, I believe.
[02:00:57.982 --> 02:00:59.343]  Well, that is encouraging.
[02:01:00.382 --> 02:01:03.523]  I know, I was just jumping up and down, just screaming!
[02:01:03.763 --> 02:01:06.744]  I was the one that pushed to get this Murphy thing done.
[02:01:06.764 --> 02:01:09.205]  I mean, I fought like hell in Washington to get this done.
[02:01:09.225 --> 02:01:10.526]  They sent me a copy of it when it was done.
[02:01:10.926 --> 02:01:11.766]  Well, good.
[02:01:12.226 --> 02:01:12.866]  Thank you for the call.
[02:01:12.906 --> 02:01:14.667]  I really do appreciate that call.
[02:01:14.707 --> 02:01:18.188]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Scott in Florida.
[02:01:18.208 --> 02:01:18.849]  Scott, go ahead.
[02:01:18.869 --> 02:01:19.349]  You're on the air.
[02:01:20.689 --> 02:01:21.409]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[02:01:21.429 --> 02:01:21.830]  Hi Paul.
[02:01:22.870 --> 02:01:23.190]  Welcome.
[02:01:23.770 --> 02:01:23.950]  Hi.
[02:01:24.250 --> 02:01:28.512]  Yeah, I just wanted to tell you that I was a counterintelligence agent for the government for about five years.
[02:01:29.110 --> 02:01:37.755]  And I listened to your interview with William Rodriguez, the janitor in the World Trade Center, and I have a piece of the World Trade Center, a rather large piece.
[02:01:37.775 --> 02:01:39.276]  It's got marble and steel through it.
[02:01:39.916 --> 02:01:41.617]  Did you send me an email about that?
[02:01:41.777 --> 02:01:42.278]  Yes, I did.
[02:01:42.318 --> 02:01:42.858]  Three times.
[02:01:42.898 --> 02:01:43.778]  I never got a response.
[02:01:44.199 --> 02:01:53.004]  Well, I printed it off and put it in a folder of things to do, and you say, do you want to test it for explosives residue?
[02:01:53.044 --> 02:01:53.464]  Absolutely.
[02:01:54.184 --> 02:01:55.085]  I think it's a smoking gun.
[02:01:56.010 --> 02:01:57.771]  Well, I mean, have you kept it contained?
[02:01:57.811 --> 02:01:58.432]  Absolutely.
[02:01:58.492 --> 02:01:59.552]  It's in a plastic bag.
[02:01:59.612 --> 02:02:00.673]  It's in my house right now.
[02:02:01.494 --> 02:02:04.936]  I got it from another counterintelligence agent that was on the scene at the World Trade Center.
[02:02:05.536 --> 02:02:11.700]  And as you know, as special agents, we have a badge of credentials that can let us do anything we want to, basically.
[02:02:12.201 --> 02:02:13.522]  Basically a license to do anything.
[02:02:13.542 --> 02:02:15.063]  We don't have to listen to law enforcement.
[02:02:15.083 --> 02:02:15.983]  We don't have to do anything.
[02:02:16.143 --> 02:02:17.104]  Who were you assigned?
[02:02:17.224 --> 02:02:18.105]  What were you assigned to?
[02:02:18.325 --> 02:02:23.108]  I was in the 513th Military Intelligence Brigade, 202nd Military Intelligence Battalion.
[02:02:23.789 --> 02:02:24.509]  Well, stay there.
[02:02:24.569 --> 02:02:27.771]  I didn't know that you'd call into the show where I would have gone to you earlier, Scott.
[02:02:28.331 --> 02:02:28.631]  Stay there.
[02:02:28.651 --> 02:02:29.991]  I want to hear some more about this.
[02:02:30.832 --> 02:02:33.853]  I don't know how much it costs or where you send it or what lab you have tested.
[02:02:35.133 --> 02:02:44.437]  We'll be right back and we'll talk more about this on the other side and we'll also play an audio clip about all this infighting and the rats basically leaving the sinking ship.
[02:02:46.650 --> 02:02:49.514]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.754 --> 02:02:51.336]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.676 --> 02:02:56.342]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.702 --> 02:03:01.127]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:03:01.548 --> 02:03:05.733]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:05.933 --> 02:03:08.774]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.874 --> 02:03:13.535]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.735 --> 02:03:18.176]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.376 --> 02:03:25.598]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:25.858 --> 02:03:28.299]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[02:03:47.330 --> 02:03:48.371]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:03:48.691 --> 02:03:51.492]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:51.752 --> 02:03:55.915]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:56.335 --> 02:03:57.155]  So what do you do?
[02:03:57.475 --> 02:04:02.038]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:02.538 --> 02:04:04.660]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:04:05.140 --> 02:04:19.853]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical and Radioactive Fallouts, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[02:04:46.801 --> 02:04:52.126]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:04:52.446 --> 02:04:57.711]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business in the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[02:04:58.151 --> 02:05:01.154]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[02:05:45.333 --> 02:05:50.377]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.717 --> 02:05:53.019]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:55.303 --> 02:06:01.608]  Well, my friends, we're now 8 minutes, 14 seconds into this third hour.
[02:06:02.188 --> 02:06:05.511]  We've got about 51 minutes left in worldwide transmission against tyranny.
[02:06:06.071 --> 02:06:09.974]  In defense of liberty, Paul Watson will be riding shotgun with us for another 20 minutes or so.
[02:06:09.994 --> 02:06:12.696]  We'll continue with the news and calls after he leaves us.
[02:06:12.716 --> 02:06:18.020]  I also have a clip I want to play concerning Tiananmen Square to try to decipher some of the propaganda.
[02:06:19.130 --> 02:06:40.688]  There's another little CNN piece that we'll play in a second and listen to the subtle twisting in the things that they say and do in this piece, but also listen to some of the Republican Senators talking about the affront of asking them questions, or the affront of shutting the Senate down and demanding answers from the executive and demanding answers from the leadership!
[02:06:41.556 --> 02:06:46.359]  Folks, when they set the Senate up, and for the first hundred years of the Senate, there wasn't this hierarchy.
[02:06:46.979 --> 02:06:52.362]  But now it's all about privilege, it's all about hierarchy, it's all about the Senate targeting people who don't play ball.
[02:06:53.002 --> 02:06:58.705]  They took our Senators from the states until 1913 and the 17th Amendment.
[02:06:59.686 --> 02:07:06.170]  The state legislatures that we elected, they would then vote and appoint the Senators and would recall them.
[02:07:06.230 --> 02:07:08.531]  They were creatures of the states.
[02:07:09.392 --> 02:07:11.616]  And that gave the states the power they were due.
[02:07:12.197 --> 02:07:13.500]  That was one measure of that.
[02:07:14.041 --> 02:07:19.231]  Now we see the federal power just increasing and encroaching ever since then.
[02:07:20.646 --> 02:07:39.419]  In fact, the 17th Amendment was a greater blow than some of the things that Lincoln did after he was killed with Reconstruction with those policies of setting up a federal centralized power, because the states then just revolted at the local levels and federal power was unable to be extruded and exercised upon the populations.
[02:07:39.479 --> 02:07:45.263]  But since the 17th Amendment, it has, because the senators all became their own little private viceroys over the states.
[02:07:46.391 --> 02:07:49.818]  But going back to our caller, you know, sir, there's so many facets to this.
[02:07:49.838 --> 02:07:54.086]  I mean, I'm sure you have these credentials and you sound legitimate and I know the military was in there.
[02:07:55.510 --> 02:07:59.594]  I know that pieces were hauled off under guard and shot up for smelting.
[02:08:00.094 --> 02:08:03.277]  I don't know if this many years later there'd be plastic explosive residue.
[02:08:03.637 --> 02:08:11.564]  And I don't know if we found that residue that would be widely accepted because it's been four years since then and they might claim that this had been a setup.
[02:08:11.624 --> 02:08:15.707]  But I would challenge you, sir, to find a laboratory to do the test.
[02:08:16.127 --> 02:08:19.290]  I would do the test for a sub-chemical in the plastic.
[02:08:19.310 --> 02:08:21.532]  I'm no chemist, but I've read about some of the testing.
[02:08:21.952 --> 02:08:28.013]  And I wouldn't even tell them where it came from, because people are such tattletales, they'd probably red flag it and then it would be seized.
[02:08:29.294 --> 02:08:32.714]  But believe me, they don't want that debris being tested.
[02:08:33.554 --> 02:08:43.616]  So I don't think it's something that I can take on, but if you'd like to take it on and step forward and credential yourself and then bring it forward, I'd be glad to report on it and blow it wide open.
[02:08:43.877 --> 02:08:49.698]  At this time, I would advise you, though, not to give out any more details about your name or exactly where you were in military intelligence.
[02:08:49.718 --> 02:08:50.798]  I think enough of that's been done.
[02:08:51.458 --> 02:08:52.759]  Uh, here, but I did get your emails.
[02:08:52.859 --> 02:08:53.839]  I'm sorry I didn't respond.
[02:08:53.859 --> 02:08:57.441]  This is just another example of the literal mountain of information I live under.
[02:08:57.761 --> 02:09:08.566]  But, uh, please elaborate, you know, if you'd like, on what you did see when you were there or this individual that was there that gave you this piece of debris from one of the towers.
[02:09:09.150 --> 02:09:09.870]  All right, exactly.
[02:09:10.890 --> 02:09:14.611]  I'm not even going to say the unit now that you said not to.
[02:09:14.631 --> 02:09:16.091]  Well, you've already said that.
[02:09:16.111 --> 02:09:17.312]  I just wouldn't give us any more details.
[02:09:17.792 --> 02:09:38.176]  Okay, so I'm in the military intelligence unit, and I was in the military intelligence unit before September 11th and after, and an agent gave me a debris from the World Trade Center that, like you said on the William Rodriguez interview, that was GPS-tracked by trucks and no one could take pictures or videos.
[02:09:38.795 --> 02:09:50.420]  and he comes uh... maybe about three months later and was handing the stuff out like candy and uh... to uh... well, I'm not going to say the unit but he gave me a piece and it has steel through it, it's got marble on it.
[02:09:50.480 --> 02:10:05.167]  I mean I've talked to cops and firemen, I've seen it, I've been in restaurants right across the street, there's a deli there uh... where the south tower fell and I ate a few times, we were down there doing interviews and they got big pieces of it in there that the local cops gave them so it's not like
[02:10:06.184 --> 02:10:07.885]  You know, it's some evil thing you've got.
[02:10:07.905 --> 02:10:12.388]  I mean, there were tons and tons of it, but obviously, you know, these were given out, I guess, as mementos.
[02:10:12.568 --> 02:10:13.749]  Mementos, exactly.
[02:10:14.449 --> 02:10:19.873]  And then I heard your interview, and then I started looking up on the internet, you know, where, does anyone else have this?
[02:10:20.273 --> 02:10:25.236]  And the only place I found was a Smithsonian and a traveling September 11th memorial.
[02:10:25.997 --> 02:10:26.917]  And no one else has it.
[02:10:26.937 --> 02:10:27.718]  It's not on eBay.
[02:10:27.738 --> 02:10:28.879]  You can't get this for free.
[02:10:29.339 --> 02:10:32.641]  And then going back, that just basically clarifies exactly what you said.
[02:10:32.661 --> 02:10:33.662]  You can't get this stuff.
[02:10:33.682 --> 02:10:35.383]  That's why you were asking for people's, you know,
[02:10:35.765 --> 02:10:39.432]  You know, death in their shirt that people hadn't washed, but they don't have it.
[02:10:47.189 --> 02:10:51.872]  Uh, say about four inches long, four inches wide squares, and it's been blued.
[02:10:51.892 --> 02:10:56.756]  And I've talked to a lot of people who've been given it by the city, but why would they do that and then blue it?
[02:10:57.276 --> 02:10:59.938]  Why would they dunk it, and then, and then fire it and cook it?
[02:11:00.438 --> 02:11:00.879]  Right, exactly.
[02:11:00.899 --> 02:11:02.039]  Best to get rid of evidence, folks.
[02:11:02.099 --> 02:11:02.320]  Right.
[02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:04.081]  Mine, mine is completely pure.
[02:11:04.101 --> 02:11:08.084]  As soon as I got it, I put it in a plastic bag that I had been listening to you for about three or four years.
[02:11:08.724 --> 02:11:12.887]  I put it in a bag, and they'll eventually have it tested for explosives, but I thought tons of people had it.
[02:11:13.227 --> 02:11:15.969]  But then I realized that no one has it, after your interview.
[02:11:16.502 --> 02:11:20.385]  And that's why I started, you know, trying to contact you and saying, hey, this is a smoking gun.
[02:11:20.405 --> 02:11:20.886]  This is it.
[02:11:21.366 --> 02:11:22.607]  You know, because no one has this stuff.
[02:11:23.168 --> 02:11:23.708]  And I have it.
[02:11:24.108 --> 02:11:28.933]  But the other point I wanted to make... Well, I mean, could you make some inquiries of this with chemists in a nonchalant way?
[02:11:28.973 --> 02:11:36.739]  Hey, you know, I'm with this blah, blah, blah group doing an investigation, but I want to have this tested for this chemical.
[02:11:37.340 --> 02:11:41.103]  I mean, they have to do a wide spectrum test for what type of
[02:11:42.725 --> 02:11:45.526]  Explosives, but I wouldn't tell them where it came from.
[02:11:45.726 --> 02:11:49.368]  I won't tell them either, because probably I'll get, you know, they're already watching me.
[02:11:49.608 --> 02:11:50.008]  I don't know.
[02:11:50.388 --> 02:11:53.010]  But anyway, I have two other things I want to tell you.
[02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:58.152]  I just wanted to tell you that you are banned at Fort Gordon, where I was stationed, handing out Alex videos.
[02:11:58.612 --> 02:12:01.613]  You will be kicked out of the Army for being delusional.
[02:12:02.334 --> 02:12:09.977]  I was the first of many people that have been kicked out of the Army, and the military police will actually do sweeps, and they will go through the barracks rooms,
[02:12:10.376 --> 02:12:18.543]  And they'll look at your computer and if you have downloaded any of Alex Jones videos or they found any, you are automatically sent to a psychiatrist and then they'll kick you out.
[02:12:19.890 --> 02:12:21.391]  Well, that I have confirmed.
[02:12:22.813 --> 02:12:34.803]  I have a personal friend who had gotten into the Marines, and this was back when I was a lot more mainstream, back in, like, 98, when I just had a few videos out, and I was anti-Bill Clinton, anti-UN.
[02:12:34.843 --> 02:12:41.229]  I mean, I was pretty tan compared to now, before I'd really fallen down the rabbit hole and found out how serious things were, and I was just learning.
[02:12:43.214 --> 02:12:43.954]  Well, let's be accurate.
[02:12:43.974 --> 02:12:46.975]  My friend's little brother, who I'm good friends with, was in the Marines.
[02:12:46.995 --> 02:12:49.376]  We even had him on the radio, but he wouldn't say his name.
[02:12:49.796 --> 02:12:51.656]  We had him in studio up at KJFK.
[02:12:52.076 --> 02:12:52.717]  Big ol' boy.
[02:12:53.477 --> 02:12:57.158]  And he was in the Marines, and he got my video, went and handed it out, because he hates the U.N.
[02:12:57.718 --> 02:13:04.160]  And they called him into the colonel's office, and they said, you hand out any more of these, we're going to put you in the psychiatric ward.
[02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:04.760]  Exactly.
[02:13:04.780 --> 02:13:05.440]  That's what happened to me.
[02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:09.770]  So there's some memo going around with this and then they said you're going to have to run.
[02:13:09.810 --> 02:13:15.062]  It was like every day for hours and hours with his rifle on his head saying he was stupid.
[02:13:15.798 --> 02:13:17.059]  But you know what happened?
[02:13:17.099 --> 02:13:19.440]  It made everybody want the videos and they all got videos.
[02:13:19.800 --> 02:13:20.060]  Right.
[02:13:20.140 --> 02:13:24.683]  And then even his sergeant was watching the videos saying, it's true, just don't tell anybody.
[02:13:24.923 --> 02:13:25.443]  So you know what?
[02:13:25.503 --> 02:13:27.024]  I mean, they try to keep it from the troops.
[02:13:27.304 --> 02:13:28.885]  It just isn't going to work.
[02:13:28.905 --> 02:13:29.205]  You're right.
[02:13:29.325 --> 02:13:30.526]  It's absolutely not working.
[02:13:30.546 --> 02:13:31.126]  So what happened?
[02:13:31.146 --> 02:13:32.587]  They suddenly all wanted them, didn't they?
[02:13:32.847 --> 02:13:34.928]  Everybody wants them, but you're not allowed to have them.
[02:13:34.948 --> 02:13:41.371]  They started doing barrack suites where they have to actually go into your computer, which I think, I don't know if that's even right.
[02:13:41.511 --> 02:13:44.513]  Well, I guess it's military, but I don't even know if they can do that.
[02:13:44.986 --> 02:13:50.650]  But, they were doing sweeps, military sweeps, like black masks, you know, going in and looking for Alex Jones videos?
[02:13:50.730 --> 02:13:51.451]  I mean, come on!
[02:13:51.951 --> 02:14:11.325]  And then, the other thing I wanted to tell you is, uh, uh, uh, I don't know if this, I don't even, I shouldn't even say this, but I just wanted to tell you that, uh, we are collecting on allies, we are collecting human intelligence on Kuwaitis, and the whole country, and you can, it's going, it's being run right out of the Kuwait resident office, in, uh, Camp Doha, Kuwait.
[02:14:11.906 --> 02:14:13.167]  It's illegal, I've been told.
[02:14:13.804 --> 02:14:19.008]  And we are doing that, we are collecting on our allies, so people can't get pissed about, you know, Israel collecting on us.
[02:14:19.748 --> 02:14:24.111]  You know, so I don't really understand the whole... No, no, everybody spies on everybody.
[02:14:24.271 --> 02:14:24.831]  Exactly.
[02:14:25.072 --> 02:14:28.034]  It's just that Israel has total penetration.
[02:14:28.514 --> 02:14:31.176]  I just wanted to let everyone know that yes, we do do it too.
[02:14:31.496 --> 02:14:40.682]  And we are collecting on Kuwaiti citizens and their parliament, and everything that they do is running right out the Kuwaiti resident office, Camp Doha, Kuwait.
[02:14:42.017 --> 02:14:42.978]  Well, that's amazing.
[02:14:43.258 --> 02:14:48.481]  Now, I have heard about these sweeps looking for anti-government, New American magazines, my videos.
[02:14:48.801 --> 02:14:50.362]  I've confirmed that from multiple sources.
[02:14:50.623 --> 02:14:53.404]  But, you know, all it's doing is waking up the generals in people.
[02:14:53.725 --> 02:14:54.205]  Absolutely!
[02:14:54.325 --> 02:14:58.388]  I mean, can you imagine when the brass sits down and watches a martial law video?
[02:14:58.688 --> 02:14:58.988]  Oh, yeah!
[02:14:59.048 --> 02:15:02.390]  When they sent me it, I was one of the first ones that they got.
[02:15:02.891 --> 02:15:04.091]  And they sent me up there, too.
[02:15:04.732 --> 02:15:07.393]  And I gave them, you know, the Jones videos, too.
[02:15:07.413 --> 02:15:08.674]  And they watched and they came back.
[02:15:08.714 --> 02:15:09.515]  I gave them, you know,
[02:15:10.095 --> 02:15:10.915]  We're good to go.
[02:15:31.904 --> 02:15:34.465]  Oh, so they say I'm very persuasive, but I'm delusional?
[02:15:34.525 --> 02:15:35.406]  Or you're delusional?
[02:15:35.626 --> 02:15:35.866]  I am.
[02:15:36.106 --> 02:15:40.268]  They said that I have a shared psychosis with Alex Jones.
[02:15:42.149 --> 02:15:44.270]  Sir, I'm begging you right now.
[02:15:44.290 --> 02:15:45.430]  Do you have a fax machine?
[02:15:46.190 --> 02:15:46.731]  No, I do not.
[02:15:46.931 --> 02:15:49.212]  Can you get to the local Kinko's and fax it to me?
[02:15:49.672 --> 02:15:49.832]  Sure.
[02:15:50.152 --> 02:15:50.532]  No problem.
[02:15:50.712 --> 02:15:52.233]  I'm not pleading, I'm begging.
[02:15:52.533 --> 02:15:52.833]  I will.
[02:15:53.053 --> 02:15:54.834]  I'm prostrating myself before you.
[02:15:55.374 --> 02:15:56.375]  I am beseeching thee.
[02:15:56.975 --> 02:15:58.076]  Because that'll be a big article.
[02:15:58.176 --> 02:15:58.896]  I love that.
[02:15:58.976 --> 02:16:01.097]  I love that I've been certified by the Army
[02:16:02.302 --> 02:16:03.123]  Sure.
[02:16:03.283 --> 02:16:04.363]  As being delusional.
[02:16:04.704 --> 02:16:06.545]  So what I want you to do is go to a fax machine.
[02:16:06.585 --> 02:16:07.685]  We're going to put you on hold.
[02:16:07.705 --> 02:16:08.266]  Okay.
[02:16:09.427 --> 02:16:11.768]  Well, I don't have to do... I can give you the fax number right now.
[02:16:11.788 --> 02:16:12.308]  Give it to me.
[02:16:12.348 --> 02:16:13.209]  I'll have it to you tomorrow.
[02:16:13.809 --> 02:16:19.273]  Folks, everybody don't send me faxes yet because then it'll be out of fax paper and no hundred page faxes.
[02:16:19.753 --> 02:16:20.814]  I'm just telling the audience this.
[02:16:21.534 --> 02:16:21.654]  It's 512... 512... 291... 291... 57...
[02:16:29.133 --> 02:16:30.114]  No, that's my office number.
[02:16:30.154 --> 02:16:31.955]  I'm losing my mind.
[02:16:31.975 --> 02:16:34.936]  512-291-5750 is my office number.
[02:16:35.377 --> 02:16:36.817]  And people can call me there if they want.
[02:16:36.837 --> 02:16:38.218]  Of course, you can't call and talk to me, folks.
[02:16:38.258 --> 02:16:38.899]  I'm working all the time.
[02:16:38.919 --> 02:16:40.419]  You can talk to some of my folks here.
[02:16:41.100 --> 02:16:42.341]  But if you want to fax me, it's 512-899-9809.
[02:16:42.361 --> 02:16:42.621]  That's 512-899-9809.
[02:16:51.071 --> 02:17:09.044]  899-9809 and I'm going to put you on hold and give you my private secret email address and Paul Watts has been holding this whole time but I want you to send me your psychology report and you're saying on there it says you share a psychosis with Alex Jones.
[02:17:09.124 --> 02:17:09.624]  Yes I do.
[02:17:10.445 --> 02:17:12.867]  A shared psychosis.
[02:17:13.945 --> 02:17:16.387]  That's nice and, uh, that's incredible.
[02:17:17.988 --> 02:17:19.109]  Thank you so much for the call.
[02:17:19.149 --> 02:17:19.749]  I appreciate it.
[02:17:19.769 --> 02:17:20.690]  No problem.
[02:17:20.770 --> 02:17:22.011]  I'll put him on hold and give him that place.
[02:17:22.231 --> 02:17:23.432]  Paul Watson, I know you've been holding.
[02:17:23.452 --> 02:17:24.893]  We haven't even played this clip yet.
[02:17:24.933 --> 02:17:25.413]  Paul, stay there.
[02:17:25.433 --> 02:17:29.796]  We'll come back and get some comments from you on this and then we'll play this, uh, several clips.
[02:17:30.417 --> 02:17:32.318]  One of them about the rebellion in the Senate.
[02:17:33.519 --> 02:17:35.460]  Folks, you know everything I talk about is documented.
[02:17:35.480 --> 02:17:36.821]  But see, we have psychosis.
[02:17:37.542 --> 02:17:39.783]  We don't want to take the microchip from Tommy Thompson.
[02:17:40.003 --> 02:17:42.185]  We don't like Andy Rooney saying we should be forced to take it.
[02:17:42.425 --> 02:17:43.466]  See, that's psychosis.
[02:17:46.636 --> 02:17:49.938]  In the past few years, millions of Americans have made the switch to natural products.
[02:17:50.258 --> 02:17:55.541]  Herbs, minerals, vitamins, and essential oils are now being recognized as the safest and most effective products in the quest for good health.
[02:17:55.801 --> 02:17:57.682]  Introducing Vitamir Mouthwash and Toothpaste.

[02:18:45.376 --> 02:18:45.816]  Gold.
[02:18:46.177 --> 02:18:47.457]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:18:47.718 --> 02:18:53.802]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:18:53.982 --> 02:18:57.804]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:18:58.164 --> 02:19:00.046]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:19:00.086 --> 02:19:02.387]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:19:02.527 --> 02:19:08.251]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as a common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency.
[02:19:08.251 --> 02:19:08.772]  We're good to go.
[02:19:23.268 --> 02:19:23.488]  We're good.
[02:19:47.037 --> 02:19:51.541]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:19:51.882 --> 02:19:55.965]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:19:56.266 --> 02:19:56.826]  We listened.
[02:19:57.126 --> 02:20:02.111]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:20:02.391 --> 02:20:02.872]  We listened.
[02:20:03.252 --> 02:20:06.295]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:20:06.715 --> 02:20:07.256]  We listened.
[02:20:07.716 --> 02:20:10.759]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[02:20:10.759 --> 02:20:11.119]  I don't know.
[02:20:37.616 --> 02:20:38.598]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:20:38.618 --> 02:20:40.042]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:20:46.064 --> 02:20:52.951]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[02:20:53.091 --> 02:21:06.024]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[02:21:06.204 --> 02:21:07.986]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[02:21:08.166 --> 02:21:11.629]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[02:21:11.909 --> 02:21:15.692]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?

[02:21:23.158 --> 02:21:27.121]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[02:21:27.381 --> 02:21:29.243]  Dango is what you are looking for.

[02:21:35.810 --> 02:21:36.351]  Call 888-203-6633 today!
[02:21:53.157 --> 02:21:57.039]  I can't tell you how many people in the military I've heard this exact same thing from.
[02:21:59.501 --> 02:22:06.064]  Normally they just make you run till you throw up and threaten you, but a lot of the officers agree with the facts.
[02:22:06.084 --> 02:22:06.845]  They already know about it.
[02:22:07.545 --> 02:22:14.970]  So they're having trouble, but you were telling me during the break, and just real fast, I gotta let you go, but we're gonna write a story about this if we get the documents to confirm it all, and buy documents.
[02:22:14.990 --> 02:22:20.693]  I already told our caller, I guess, I don't want anything classified, I just want it psychological, where they say that I'm delusional.
[02:22:21.990 --> 02:22:28.535]  Tell us the name of the fort again and how you know of four other people that have been kicked out and how my videos are banned.
[02:22:28.576 --> 02:22:29.096]  Tell us again.
[02:22:29.336 --> 02:22:47.092]  Yes, I was from Fort Gordon, Georgia and all the videos are banned at this base and there's already been, not only the first one, but there's also been others kicked out for just possessing Alex Jones videos and the military police are going around doing sweeps
[02:22:47.819 --> 02:22:52.583]  That anyone that possess on their computer or have Alex Jones videos are being sent to the psycho ward.
[02:22:52.983 --> 02:22:56.706]  Well, that's very, very newsworthy.
[02:22:56.746 --> 02:22:58.828]  I mean, thought police on the military basis.
[02:22:59.008 --> 02:22:59.488]  Absolutely.
[02:22:59.528 --> 02:23:04.432]  Don't they know that footage I've shot and videos I've made have aired on national TV?
[02:23:05.053 --> 02:23:08.295]  We confirmed that in Lyon County, Kentucky a year and a half ago.
[02:23:09.396 --> 02:23:14.420]  Kelly Rushing, no criminal record, outstanding member of the community, his family is old and respected in that community.
[02:23:17.542 --> 02:23:34.207]  And it was in the newspaper, he gave a state police officer a Ron Paul speech called Neocon, off C-SPAN, and my video wrote a tyranny, and they arrested him and tried to put him in jail for seven years saying the videos were terroristic and threatening the law enforcement, which just shows FEMA saying all Christians are terrorists.
[02:23:34.247 --> 02:23:35.748]  Right, well that's exactly what they do it for.
[02:23:35.788 --> 02:23:37.508]  Gordon, they threaten you with sedition.
[02:23:37.929 --> 02:23:45.411]  If you say, okay, I'm seditious, then that's okay, but if you don't say, okay, I'm just crazy, then they send you up to the psycho ward.
[02:23:46.634 --> 02:23:48.256]  Yeah, so they... well, I mean, obviously.
[02:23:48.916 --> 02:23:50.838]  They're trying to turn us into the Soviet Union.
[02:23:51.779 --> 02:23:54.561]  Listen, thank you for the call, and we'll do an article on this.
[02:23:54.621 --> 02:23:57.343]  And quickly, you need to go get those documents now.
[02:23:57.524 --> 02:23:58.624]  Don't wait until tomorrow, brother.
[02:23:58.644 --> 02:23:59.125]  I need them now.
[02:23:59.525 --> 02:23:59.745]  Now?
[02:23:59.785 --> 02:24:00.786]  Well, they're in Tampa, Florida.
[02:24:00.826 --> 02:24:01.267]  I gotta go.
[02:24:01.287 --> 02:24:02.308]  That's two hours from here.
[02:24:02.388 --> 02:24:03.008]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:24:03.028 --> 02:24:03.549]  Well, thank you.
[02:24:03.869 --> 02:24:05.731]  I'll write the article as soon as I get them.
[02:24:05.751 --> 02:24:06.131]  Alright, thank you.
[02:24:06.511 --> 02:24:06.831]  Thank you.
[02:24:07.031 --> 02:24:08.672]  Paul, we've got to get on this immediately.
[02:24:08.692 --> 02:24:11.972]  I mean, this is one more thing I've ignored over the years.
[02:24:12.012 --> 02:24:14.413]  I've already confirmed most of what he was saying.
[02:24:14.893 --> 02:24:17.013]  And, you know, the whole Kelly Rushing thing.
[02:24:17.033 --> 02:24:19.254]  I mean, this is real, folks.
[02:24:19.294 --> 02:24:20.174]  This isn't a joke.
[02:24:20.634 --> 02:24:24.935]  I wonder how they get state police ready to arrest people for giving out Ron Paul videos.
[02:24:24.955 --> 02:24:26.855]  I don't know.
[02:24:26.935 --> 02:24:28.456]  It was the case of I.B.
[02:24:28.516 --> 02:24:30.016]  Newman as well a few years ago.
[02:24:30.771 --> 02:24:35.214]  She got arrested for having terrorist paraphernalia in a car or whatever.
[02:24:35.494 --> 02:24:36.135]  Oh, I forgot!
[02:24:36.175 --> 02:24:38.056]  That's in Road to Tyranny 2, that's right.
[02:24:38.356 --> 02:24:41.979]  The naval veteran, no criminal record, had Police State 2000.
[02:24:42.079 --> 02:24:44.721]  Oh, I forgot, yeah.
[02:24:44.821 --> 02:24:48.803]  I mean, the subject of banning things, it only ever makes it more in demand.
[02:24:48.823 --> 02:24:50.204]  I mean, it wouldn't surprise me.
[02:24:50.244 --> 02:24:58.250]  I get emails every single day saying, I can't get to Alex's websites at this library, I can't get to Infowars.com at this college.
[02:24:59.093 --> 02:25:02.556]  So, I mean, it's basic filtration process that they do that by.
[02:25:02.576 --> 02:25:06.258]  But there are thousands, there are thousands of other truth-telling patriot sites.
[02:25:06.299 --> 02:25:08.080]  I wonder why it's us they hate so much.
[02:25:08.340 --> 02:25:15.165]  And I have this from inside a major Merck organization, where we have moles, and folks, this comes from GoldSource.
[02:25:15.585 --> 02:25:18.608]  When I talked about it last time, they knocked us off the air right when I said it.
[02:25:19.468 --> 02:25:22.190]  But, where they, quote, have got to take me down.
[02:25:22.210 --> 02:25:23.151]  I don't know what that means.
[02:25:23.832 --> 02:25:25.393]  Because, quote, I'm getting too close.
[02:25:25.453 --> 02:25:26.814]  What am I getting too close to, Paul?
[02:25:27.910 --> 02:25:28.330]  I don't know.
[02:25:28.510 --> 02:25:42.835]  I mean, on the public surface, it manifests itself via hit pieces like Popular Mechanics, things like that, and trying to demonize us by guilt, by association, by lumping us in with, you know, obvious crackpots and racists and people like that.
[02:25:43.706 --> 02:25:47.867]  Well, I mean, if we are getting too close, then, you know, it's by our own hard work.
[02:25:47.887 --> 02:25:50.688]  The websites come on leaps and bounds in the past year.
[02:25:51.249 --> 02:25:53.569]  We get more hits than Rush Limbaugh on Sunday.
[02:25:53.649 --> 02:26:02.112]  So, I think we are touching a lot of nerves, and it's becoming clear that they may have to shift tactics to try and get us out of the way one way or another.
[02:26:02.372 --> 02:26:05.053]  And, folks, I don't say this for theatrical effect.
[02:26:05.393 --> 02:26:10.115]  If they kill me, just, I want all of you to make 1,000 copies of each of my videos.
[02:26:10.955 --> 02:26:15.977]  And if you'll just promise me you'll do that, folks, I'll know that it's worth it.
[02:26:15.997 --> 02:26:17.197]  It's already worth it.
[02:26:17.217 --> 02:26:18.258]  We've already had a big effect.
[02:26:18.958 --> 02:26:20.218]  And Paul's going to keep working on it.
[02:26:20.238 --> 02:26:21.499]  My wife's going to keep working on it.
[02:26:21.819 --> 02:26:22.599]  They can't stop us.
[02:26:23.079 --> 02:26:23.799]  There's too many of us.
[02:26:23.819 --> 02:26:25.220]  That's the only reason I'm still alive.
[02:26:25.760 --> 02:26:30.424]  And because so many people in government are on our side as well, but they've got hitmen that are ready to do it.
[02:26:30.885 --> 02:26:41.794]  And it does scare me sometimes because we are getting, we are really, I mean of all the thorns that have been stuck in their hind end, we're one of the biggest and the longest and the most poisonous, you know, to the New World Order, Paul.
[02:26:41.814 --> 02:26:43.916]  I mean, we are, we are toe-to-toe.
[02:26:43.936 --> 02:26:49.121]  I mean, we are, this small team I've got, really has hit the Achilles tendon of these people.
[02:26:50.293 --> 02:26:58.637]  Well, yeah, because we're so pervasive and we've got such widespread appeal now that other alternative websites that are much bigger than ours always pick up our articles.
[02:26:59.098 --> 02:27:08.482]  They get copied around the internet so many times that by the end of it, hundreds of thousands or even in some cases millions of people have read this information, so it's got to be hurting them.
[02:27:09.863 --> 02:27:11.524]  In some cases millions, Paul?
[02:27:11.564 --> 02:27:13.185]  I mean, basically everything we... Quite in most cases.
[02:27:13.465 --> 02:27:13.645]  Yeah.
[02:27:16.673 --> 02:27:18.273]  Well, it's a great responsibility.
[02:27:18.313 --> 02:27:20.114]  With great power comes great responsibility.
[02:27:20.154 --> 02:27:20.714]  It's daunting.
[02:27:20.734 --> 02:27:25.295]  It makes... Most people get puffed up when they get a little bit of power.
[02:27:25.795 --> 02:27:27.015]  It's very daunting to me.
[02:27:27.215 --> 02:27:29.515]  I just... I just try to do a good job.
[02:27:30.036 --> 02:27:31.656]  Paul, let's do a few more minutes on the other side.
[02:27:31.676 --> 02:27:32.496]  I'll let you get to dinner.
[02:27:36.077 --> 02:27:36.977]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.457 --> 02:27:39.077]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.097 --> 02:27:42.658]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.074 --> 02:27:48.695]  Government is best, which governs me.
[02:27:49.236 --> 02:27:50.557]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:27:50.997 --> 02:27:53.699]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:27:54.140 --> 02:27:56.802]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:27:57.222 --> 02:28:03.707]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:29:48.431 --> 02:29:49.912]  Sooner or later, we all have to face it.
[02:29:50.092 --> 02:29:54.014]  We live in dangerous times, and the more prepared we are, the better our chances are to survive them.
[02:29:54.294 --> 02:30:01.617]  The threat of a terrorist nuclear attack, a dirty bomb, or a nuclear power plant accident, or a nuclear waste bill, is something we all face, every day.
[02:30:01.897 --> 02:30:03.798]  That's why no family should be without the Nucalert.

[02:30:37.372 --> 02:30:37.612]  Nucal Alert.
[02:30:37.672 --> 02:30:38.853]  Isn't your family worth it?
[02:30:53.476 --> 02:30:55.937]  I mean, it's no stretch.
[02:30:55.957 --> 02:30:57.898]  The government's killed people.
[02:31:08.604 --> 02:31:16.368]  Down in Mexico, every day or two, they kill reporters that report on cartels or corrupt cops, and it's really bad in the Philippines.
[02:31:16.448 --> 02:31:17.668]  It's bad all over Latin America.
[02:31:17.948 --> 02:31:18.949]  It's really bad in Russia.
[02:31:18.989 --> 02:31:25.832]  Every week or two, I see an article where they kill some reporter who, you know, a reporter comes out and stands up against a child kidnapping ring.
[02:31:25.872 --> 02:31:27.212]  They shoot him 15 times.
[02:31:27.853 --> 02:31:28.273]  But you know what?
[02:31:28.293 --> 02:31:30.074]  That person's going straight to heaven, folks.
[02:31:30.894 --> 02:31:32.415]  And, you know, see, I believe in God.
[02:31:32.475 --> 02:31:33.915]  I believe in life after death.
[02:31:34.136 --> 02:31:35.056]  But even if I didn't,
[02:31:36.377 --> 02:31:38.578]  Wouldn't you give your life up for your children's safety?
[02:31:39.379 --> 02:31:44.002]  And think about their children, and their children, and their children, and their children, and their children, and their children.
[02:31:44.462 --> 02:31:52.487]  And for all the little old ladies, and all the innocent people being given poison vaccines in Africa, and Latin America, and Asia.
[02:31:52.807 --> 02:31:55.429]  I mean, the globalists are evil bastards, folks.
[02:31:55.949 --> 02:31:59.952]  And that's what we're supposed to do as men, is stand up and defend the weak.
[02:32:00.592 --> 02:32:02.914]  And if you don't have that instinctive need to do that,
[02:32:04.321 --> 02:32:05.822]  Life isn't worth living.
[02:32:05.842 --> 02:32:15.590]  You know, all these people that have this tons of money and power and big cars and twenty million dollar houses and huge jet boats and private jets, they're not happy, folks.
[02:32:16.210 --> 02:32:22.275]  The people that are happy are the people that really are fighting for a good cause, that are serving, that are getting involved.
[02:32:22.315 --> 02:32:24.416]  And there's a sick twist to that, though.
[02:32:24.436 --> 02:32:31.942]  There's so many well-meaning people who are serving evil because they've been conned, they've been manipulated, they've been deceived.
[02:32:32.879 --> 02:32:35.400]  And so that's really my frustration is there's so many good people.
[02:32:35.640 --> 02:32:40.721]  You know, the person they may send someday to kill me will probably think it's for a good cause.
[02:32:41.242 --> 02:32:42.442]  They'll be brainwashed, folks.
[02:32:44.082 --> 02:32:44.863]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:32:45.503 --> 02:32:47.864]  Seriously, folks, my life does not matter.
[02:32:48.144 --> 02:32:48.864]  I love my life.
[02:32:48.924 --> 02:32:49.584]  I enjoy my life.
[02:32:49.604 --> 02:32:55.406]  I'm looking right out the window right now at these golden green trees with the sun on them and this dome of a blue sky.
[02:32:56.152 --> 02:32:57.852]  I could just walk forever in the woods.
[02:32:57.892 --> 02:32:58.753]  I could just walk forever.
[02:32:59.173 --> 02:33:02.034]  I could just sit out on the dock forever and fish in weather like this.
[02:33:02.854 --> 02:33:07.355]  You know, I think about all the beautiful things, all the good things in the world that we're fighting.
[02:33:07.395 --> 02:33:08.695]  I mean, these are some evil people!
[02:33:09.116 --> 02:33:10.536]  They're doing horrible things!
[02:33:10.716 --> 02:33:11.956]  They've got to be fought!
[02:33:12.416 --> 02:33:13.757]  We've got the freedom we have.
[02:33:13.797 --> 02:33:15.717]  We have all these possessions.
[02:33:16.998 --> 02:33:20.439]  We have the ideas we have because people fought and died for them.
[02:33:21.059 --> 02:33:21.899]  Freedom isn't free!
[02:33:22.942 --> 02:33:39.151]  And, uh, you know, it is daunting to know that literally, folks, on military bases, my videos are handed out to everybody, and, uh, there's state police memos out on them, there's, uh, you know, they go around harassing people, uh, the, you know, I could talk about this every day and hype them.
[02:33:39.431 --> 02:33:41.332]  It's a hyper's dream to have this going on.
[02:33:41.792 --> 02:33:50.937]  You hear all these fakes, these flakes, you've got these flaky videos out, they're always trying to hype them, how they're really cutting edge and scary, and the government doesn't like them, but, you know, that's the truth with my videos.
[02:33:51.843 --> 02:33:54.504]  I mean, we got news articles where they arrest people.
[02:33:55.224 --> 02:33:59.806]  We got news articles where they charge them.
[02:33:59.867 --> 02:34:07.450]  And again, we have news articles where somebody puts a sign up in their yard saying our court system is corrupt and the judge orders the man arrested.
[02:34:07.470 --> 02:34:07.890]  Remember that?
[02:34:07.910 --> 02:34:10.311]  Of course, the judge got in deep trouble and got kicked off the bench for it.
[02:34:10.351 --> 02:34:12.552]  But it just shows the delusional nature.
[02:34:12.732 --> 02:34:14.513]  We're not bad making videos.
[02:34:14.973 --> 02:34:19.599]  Where a firefighter shot video of FEMA saying Christians are bad and the Founding Fathers are bad?
[02:34:19.959 --> 02:34:21.040]  That's seditious!
[02:34:21.301 --> 02:34:22.922]  Not showing a video of it!
[02:34:23.643 --> 02:34:24.945]  I love George Washington!
[02:34:25.165 --> 02:34:26.406]  I've read a whole bunch of books about him!
[02:34:26.467 --> 02:34:26.847]  I love him!
[02:34:26.887 --> 02:34:27.848]  I feel like I know him!
[02:34:28.068 --> 02:34:29.650]  He made incredible sacrifices!
[02:34:31.572 --> 02:34:32.734]  I know our Founding Fathers!
[02:34:32.774 --> 02:34:33.515]  I've studied them!
[02:34:33.575 --> 02:34:34.356]  I respect them!
[02:34:35.029 --> 02:34:39.773]  Don't you sit there and call them bad, and then tell me I'm a traitor, you son of a bitch!
[02:34:40.033 --> 02:34:45.677]  I mean, I'm sorry to talk like that, but you've got the nerve to tell me I'm a traitor when you're putting down George Washington!
[02:34:45.697 --> 02:34:47.759]  I mean, you people are sick!
[02:34:48.659 --> 02:34:49.240]  You're sick!
[02:34:50.181 --> 02:34:51.822]  You've got major malfunctions!
[02:34:52.102 --> 02:34:54.524]  Yes, we have the government, they teach it nationwide!
[02:34:56.522 --> 02:34:59.464]  You've heard all the firefighters calling and going, they teach that right here in our town!
[02:34:59.504 --> 02:35:01.085]  Yeah, George Washington's bad!
[02:35:01.366 --> 02:35:02.266]  America's bad!
[02:35:02.486 --> 02:35:04.768]  Hell, man, we're trying to save this country!
[02:35:07.190 --> 02:35:10.192]  So I, you know, I don't... Look, folks.
[02:35:11.973 --> 02:35:14.255]  I'm not up here tootin' my horn about how big and bad I am.
[02:35:14.295 --> 02:35:14.555]  I'm not.
[02:35:14.575 --> 02:35:16.016]  I'm just a soft person.
[02:35:16.036 --> 02:35:16.757]  The body's weak.
[02:35:17.495 --> 02:35:18.536]  But the soul is strong.
[02:35:18.896 --> 02:35:25.162]  And when I had four guys around me pounding me, telling me to shut up and stop talking about this stuff, you know, I just had more strength than I've ever had in my life.
[02:35:25.702 --> 02:35:27.604]  I'm not afraid to die for a good cause.
[02:35:28.024 --> 02:35:30.566]  I am remorseful that I won't put out the films I should make.
[02:35:31.087 --> 02:35:33.549]  I'm remorseful that I won't be able to write the books that I want to write.
[02:35:33.829 --> 02:35:41.536]  I'm remorseful that I haven't been able to put forward the information I understand at the true level of my understanding, which I know you have that same understanding.
[02:35:41.776 --> 02:35:44.638]  I'm mad that I haven't gotten the jobs done I need to get done.
[02:35:44.899 --> 02:35:48.081]  That is my only remorse in my heart, in my soul.
[02:35:48.322 --> 02:35:50.323]  And I believe God's going to give me many more years.
[02:35:50.623 --> 02:35:52.345]  But we have to be prepared!
[02:35:53.300 --> 02:35:54.801]  We have to be prepared.
[02:35:55.041 --> 02:36:14.353]  We have to strengthen ourselves with the stoic resolve to die for this country, and to die for freedom, and to die for God's laws, and to die for the unborn children that are being killed, and to die for all the widows that are being abused, and being warehoused in these government nursing homes, and dying in bed sores and urine.
[02:36:14.893 --> 02:36:16.454]  Nobody's there for those old women.
[02:36:16.674 --> 02:36:18.015]  Nobody's there for those old men.
[02:36:18.215 --> 02:36:20.476]  Nobody's there for the kids dying in court kidnaps.
[02:36:20.816 --> 02:36:21.857]  Nobody's there for them.
[02:36:21.877 --> 02:36:26.600]  The least I can do is stand up here and speak out against these evil bastards.
[02:36:26.980 --> 02:36:35.164]  And let me tell you something, the people in government serving this new world order, you make denials, you serve this system, you dilute yourself and tell you you're doing a good thing, you're not.
[02:36:35.364 --> 02:36:36.265]  You work for evil.
[02:36:37.114 --> 02:36:42.660]  Doesn't matter if you're not evil and you lie to yourself, you are working for evil.
[02:36:42.960 --> 02:36:45.122]  Paul, I told you on the phone privately.
[02:36:45.603 --> 02:36:47.365]  This is for when I told you when I hired you.
[02:36:48.080 --> 02:36:50.962]  Because I knew you had a good head on your shoulders and saw things the same way I did.
[02:36:51.002 --> 02:36:53.803]  Not because you're a doppelganger or a clone, but because you see.
[02:36:53.903 --> 02:36:54.524]  You see the world.
[02:36:54.724 --> 02:36:56.265]  You see it the same as Ron Paul sees it.
[02:36:56.505 --> 02:36:57.465]  Once you see it, you see it.
[02:36:57.665 --> 02:36:59.186]  And I told you, I said, this is for keeps, buddy.
[02:36:59.406 --> 02:37:00.927]  Either we win this or they're going to kill us.
[02:37:01.287 --> 02:37:02.388]  And you said, I'm ready.
[02:37:02.448 --> 02:37:02.908]  I want to go.
[02:37:02.968 --> 02:37:03.749]  I want to put on the line.
[02:37:04.049 --> 02:37:10.192]  Why, Paul, in closing, before I get to some final news here, before I let you go, why did you decide to take that step into infinity?
[02:37:10.353 --> 02:37:11.853]  To take that step into manhood?
[02:37:12.013 --> 02:37:13.454]  To take that step onto the field?
[02:37:13.634 --> 02:37:16.336]  To take that step into what it is to be a human being?
[02:37:17.788 --> 02:37:23.070]  Well, because everybody's going to die one day and the purpose of death is to make life important.
[02:37:23.170 --> 02:37:30.152]  So if you fill your life with meaningless activities, then what was the point in living and what is the point in death?
[02:37:31.152 --> 02:37:35.733]  The people who work within this system don't see the horizon of evil.
[02:37:35.773 --> 02:37:37.694]  They don't see the limitless nature of evil.
[02:37:38.516 --> 02:37:44.261]  So they live in ignorance that nobody else could use evil for those ends at that limit.
[02:37:44.341 --> 02:37:45.703]  So they don't believe it exists.
[02:37:45.763 --> 02:37:51.488]  They make rationalizations that it doesn't exist, even though they're working towards it.
[02:37:51.688 --> 02:37:54.531]  As we are working against it, many hands make light work.
[02:37:55.091 --> 02:37:56.653]  It's the flip side is the same.
[02:37:57.173 --> 02:38:02.058]  Many hands make light work for evil as well, and that's what these people are engaged in without realizing it.
[02:38:04.204 --> 02:38:06.805]  Well, I'm talking about the commitment, taking the plunge.
[02:38:06.865 --> 02:38:17.667]  I mean, I've never asked you about this, but didn't you feel invigorated and empowered and to truly be alive as soon as you faced the full horror and decided to set yourself and all your energy against it?
[02:38:18.547 --> 02:38:21.848]  Well, yeah, it's a common question after, why haven't they killed you?
[02:38:22.028 --> 02:38:23.429]  Doesn't this make you sad?
[02:38:23.469 --> 02:38:24.769]  Doesn't this make you depressed?
[02:38:25.666 --> 02:38:32.148]  It works the opposite way, in some strange way, once you face the true horror, the true evil of it, on a day-to-day basis.
[02:38:32.268 --> 02:38:35.149]  It makes you invigorated, gives you more energy to fight it.
[02:38:35.669 --> 02:38:40.831]  It's kind of like an endorphin reaction to fight it and to pour all your effort into doing so.
[02:38:40.911 --> 02:38:42.671]  So no, it does not make you depressed.
[02:38:42.751 --> 02:38:48.833]  It just makes you focused, energetic and geared towards doing something about it, which we all need to do on our own level.
[02:38:50.160 --> 02:38:50.560]  We do.
[02:38:50.860 --> 02:39:05.606]  I mean, folks, you imagine some five-year-old in Serbia being grabbed from their mother and be loaded on a plane to be flown to Saudi Arabia, Israel, to be flown to Yemen, to be flown to those Asian countries where they're literally raped and tortured for their entire lives.
[02:39:05.666 --> 02:39:07.866]  I mean, what is wrong with us, folks?
[02:39:07.926 --> 02:39:12.068]  We've killed 50 million babies in this country and we say they're not human beings.
[02:39:12.348 --> 02:39:13.508]  We're evil, folks.
[02:39:13.588 --> 02:39:14.849]  It's got to be fought.
[02:39:15.349 --> 02:39:16.530]  We've got to fight it.
[02:39:18.391 --> 02:39:23.536]  And I just don't know how those officers at those bases, why aren't they like Kerpensky who refused to go along with it?
[02:39:23.776 --> 02:39:26.519]  Why aren't they like Rick Baucus, the Brigadier General who refused to torture?
[02:39:26.760 --> 02:39:28.041]  Well, there are a lot of them in there.
[02:39:28.081 --> 02:39:33.367]  The problem is all the good people are being kicked out or leaving and we're just going to be left with this evil and we're going to have to fight these people.
[02:39:34.048 --> 02:39:42.279]  I mean, I want the police and military to know I'm your friend, but if you decide to join this evil and decide to carry out whatever will happen, you're going to lose.
[02:39:42.679 --> 02:39:45.143]  And I don't mean even when you die in the next life.
[02:39:45.343 --> 02:39:46.625]  You're going to lose in this life.
[02:39:47.065 --> 02:39:48.106]  Evil always loses.
[02:39:51.901 --> 02:39:58.365]  Well, Paul, I appreciate you coming on with us today, my friend, and I look forward to seeing you in person very soon, and you take care.
[02:39:58.385 --> 02:39:59.746]  Alright, thanks, Alex.
[02:40:00.086 --> 02:40:00.447]  You bet.
[02:40:00.567 --> 02:40:01.067]  Oh, Paul?
[02:40:01.567 --> 02:40:02.188]  Yeah?
[02:40:02.208 --> 02:40:04.069]  We got some new articles coming out tonight, don't we?
[02:40:04.829 --> 02:40:11.754]  Yeah, one on Rumsfeld basically admitting torture again, and the UN investigation of Guantanamo, how that's all staged.
[02:40:12.290 --> 02:40:22.067]  And also how these Australian terror alerts tie in with different governments playing the same terror card to fearmonger their populations into accepting slavery.
[02:40:23.280 --> 02:40:25.342]  Absolutely, and we'll talk to you soon.
[02:40:25.382 --> 02:40:27.844]  And there will be an article if I get these documents on this particular thing.
[02:40:28.164 --> 02:40:33.028]  I mean, we already have Kelly Rushing being arrested for giving Ron Paul videos out in my video.
[02:40:33.468 --> 02:40:35.369]  Court proceedings, and these videos are illegal.
[02:40:35.790 --> 02:40:37.651]  There's no law, it's Ron Paul on C-SPAN.
[02:40:37.891 --> 02:40:40.473]  Think about those, that's the one that really upset the state police.
[02:40:41.134 --> 02:40:43.816]  Ron Paul, this guy's calling the president a communist.
[02:40:43.856 --> 02:40:44.697]  That's a lie!
[02:40:44.717 --> 02:40:46.178]  I'm gonna arrest you!
[02:40:46.718 --> 02:40:48.239]  It's your problem, boy!
[02:40:48.359 --> 02:40:50.141]  I mean, what is your malfunction?
[02:40:50.934 --> 02:40:52.396]  What is wrong with those state police?
[02:40:52.436 --> 02:40:53.416]  What is wrong with you?
[02:40:53.457 --> 02:40:54.658]  I know most of you aren't like that.
[02:40:55.679 --> 02:40:57.701]  But they're taking over the ones that are mentally ill.
[02:40:59.582 --> 02:41:01.905]  And the answer is not cower in fear.
[02:41:01.925 --> 02:41:03.186]  I'm not going to give those videos out.
[02:41:03.546 --> 02:41:06.889]  Most cops, in most cases, I mean the reports are 50 to 1, literally.
[02:41:07.470 --> 02:41:08.951]  Cops are like, give me another copy of that.
[02:41:08.971 --> 02:41:09.752]  Can I have some more?
[02:41:09.772 --> 02:41:11.654]  I mean I've been up in the Austin SWAT team office.
[02:41:12.802 --> 02:41:19.704]  When they didn't even know I was going to be up there one time with another officer and then there were my videos and Oklahoma cover-up videos on the shelf.
[02:41:20.244 --> 02:41:20.944]  They all know!
[02:41:20.964 --> 02:41:22.745]  I mean, all over they know.
[02:41:22.765 --> 02:41:24.045]  They're not stupid, most of them.
[02:41:24.065 --> 02:41:30.507]  In fact, a lot of them are so smart they put little mind tricks with themselves because they can't handle the full horror of all this.
[02:41:32.888 --> 02:41:33.788]  It's just incredible.
[02:41:36.208 --> 02:41:39.890]  Look, you cannot be an accomplice to this evil.
[02:41:39.990 --> 02:41:41.370]  It must be resisted.
[02:41:42.913 --> 02:41:45.494]  Who wants to live on their knees as a slave, folks?
[02:41:46.175 --> 02:41:48.075]  And you're not safer when you do live on your knees.
[02:41:48.856 --> 02:41:51.017]  You gotta bull up and stand up against these people.
[02:41:51.037 --> 02:41:55.659]  I mean, can you imagine the guys that are running around confiscating my videos on military bases?
[02:41:55.959 --> 02:41:58.020]  And I mean, I've been hearing about this for six, seven years, folks.
[02:41:58.160 --> 02:41:58.960]  No, seven years, yeah.
[02:41:59.701 --> 02:42:00.301]  Can you imagine?
[02:42:00.361 --> 02:42:07.064]  I mean, are they asking themselves, why am I running around, not looking for drugs, not looking for whatever, why am I looking for a video?
[02:42:08.445 --> 02:42:10.906]  Why am I looking for a video of a guy
[02:42:11.767 --> 02:42:18.112]  Who goes to urban warfare training drills and shows the police chief of San Antonio saying Delta Force tried to bribe him.
[02:42:19.093 --> 02:42:24.016]  And where the helicopters blow up buildings 200 yards from a nursing home and make people have heart attacks.
[02:42:24.737 --> 02:42:28.000]  Or the Miami Herald where they fire a bullet into an all-night restaurant.
[02:42:28.240 --> 02:42:32.203]  Or the front page of the Austin American station with a headline, Army Invades Texas.
[02:42:32.423 --> 02:42:33.564]  I mean, that's all I do!
[02:42:34.144 --> 02:42:39.328]  What, I made a video where I went and talked to a police chief who himself was a, what, a colonel in the Army?
[02:42:40.689 --> 02:42:41.390]  Ale Philippus?
[02:42:42.569 --> 02:42:47.652]  I mean, I go and interview the Chief of Police of Alice, Texas, where he says that foreign troops were there?
[02:42:47.692 --> 02:42:51.134]  I mean, I'm not bad, I didn't do anything wrong.
[02:42:51.354 --> 02:42:57.837]  Ron Paul is a Vietnam veteran, three tours, a medical doctor, most conservative member of Congress!
[02:42:59.098 --> 02:43:03.200]  And they would arrest someone for having one of his videos, and why I didn't write an article about that?
[02:43:05.081 --> 02:43:05.761]  A year and a half ago.
[02:43:05.781 --> 02:43:06.922]  That's it, I'm writing the article.
[02:43:10.268 --> 02:43:13.251]  I'll take some calls in the final segment, but here's this clip from CNN.
[02:43:13.291 --> 02:43:20.098]  I want to kind of analyze and comment on here, the purposes of critique, about what happened yesterday in the Senate.
[02:43:20.138 --> 02:43:21.299]  Go ahead and roll that, please.
[02:43:23.361 --> 02:43:30.408]  The political battle over pre-war intelligence has officially spilled over onto the Senate floor.
[02:43:30.708 --> 02:43:34.592]  Mr. President, enough time has gone by.
[02:43:35.929 --> 02:43:47.596]  I demand on behalf of the American people that we understand why these investigations aren't being conducted, and in accordance with Rule 21, I now move that Senate go into closed session.
[02:43:47.616 --> 02:43:49.037]  President, I second the motion.
[02:43:49.397 --> 02:43:59.603]  The Senate's Democratic leader, triggering a closed session of the full Senate to pressure the Republican leadership to conduct an investigation into the handling of pre-war intelligence.
[02:44:00.144 --> 02:44:03.446]  A probe the Republicans had promised, but had not yet started.
[02:44:04.233 --> 02:44:10.496]  Democrats threatened that until that investigation gets underway, they would push to close the Senate chamber every day.
[02:44:11.136 --> 02:44:12.677]  Republicans were furious.
[02:44:13.337 --> 02:44:25.522]  I'll have to say, not with the previous Democratic leader, or the current Democratic leader, have ever I been slapped in the face with such an affront to the leadership of this grand institution.
[02:44:26.676 --> 02:44:31.038]  Every other time, and again we'll have to go back and look at the history... There's nothing grand about you scumbag!
[02:44:31.238 --> 02:44:41.742]  ...consideration for the other side of the aisle before a stunt, and this is a pure stunt, is being performed by Senator Reid... Frisk is as grand as gongs do do!
[02:44:45.675 --> 02:44:47.017]  I'm sorry, I'm getting really angry today.
[02:44:47.057 --> 02:44:50.122]  I mean, Frisk is about as grand as a cockroach.
[02:44:51.024 --> 02:44:51.725]  Grand!
[02:44:51.765 --> 02:44:53.588]  He really feels about himself slurping.
[02:44:54.549 --> 02:44:55.170]  Grand!
[02:44:55.210 --> 02:45:00.539]  He's into his Jaguar and his golf course and his big house and prancing around feeling grand.
[02:45:01.337 --> 02:45:06.281]  You're guilty just as much as anybody else for all the murders and the criminals and the kidnapping and all of it, Frisk.
[02:45:06.541 --> 02:45:10.363]  You sucking the money off the health care system, you big fat cockroach.
[02:45:10.904 --> 02:45:15.947]  This next thing is a little whitewash concerning Tiananmen Square, but it's half decent.
[02:45:15.967 --> 02:45:18.449]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:45:18.469 --> 02:45:23.813]  CNN had been there to cover that historic summit between Deng Xiaoping and Mikhail Gorbachev.
[02:45:25.454 --> 02:45:28.216]  But the crowds just multiplied and increased.
[02:45:29.241 --> 02:45:32.842]  They had taken over Tiananmen Square, demanding democracy.
[02:45:33.242 --> 02:45:33.943]  Unbelievable.
[02:45:34.263 --> 02:45:37.704]  We all came here to cover a summit and we walked into a revolution.
[02:45:37.884 --> 02:45:40.805]  We couldn't believe that the government tolerated this.
[02:45:40.825 --> 02:45:43.846]  That it had let it go on this far.
[02:45:44.767 --> 02:45:50.449]  They were being embarrassed, they were being humiliated on TV every night around the world and they pulled the plug on it.
[02:45:50.989 --> 02:45:57.051]  And now as we report to our viewers around the world, martial law has been declared in Beijing.
[02:45:57.591 --> 02:46:01.932]  I'm being told that the government officials are coming into the CNN control room now.
[02:46:02.212 --> 02:46:05.013]  And they said, we are here to tell you
[02:46:06.059 --> 02:46:08.541]  That the coverage of Gorbachev is over.
[02:46:09.101 --> 02:46:10.062]  Your task is over.
[02:46:10.362 --> 02:46:17.027]  Then, the bosses are saying that for us to go off the air, we would require it in writing.
[02:46:17.970 --> 02:46:21.232]  Our policy is the government has ordered us to shut down our facility.
[02:46:22.693 --> 02:46:24.254]  We are shutting down our facility.
[02:46:24.394 --> 02:46:25.055]  Can we sign off?
[02:46:25.095 --> 02:46:26.155]  May we sign off?
[02:46:26.395 --> 02:46:27.796]  Okay, we've heard the orders.
[02:46:27.836 --> 02:46:31.339]  We have our instructions from headquarters in Atlanta.
[02:46:32.099 --> 02:46:38.063]  After martial law was declared, and they pulled the plug on our broadcast, we didn't have a way to get our pictures out.
[02:46:38.954 --> 02:46:41.356]  So we would do something called pigeon them out.
[02:46:41.416 --> 02:46:43.957]  And in those days, it was fairly easy to do.
[02:46:43.997 --> 02:46:49.641]  You would take your tape to the airport, a copy of your tape, and you would find a sympathetic person to carry the tape for you.
[02:46:50.141 --> 02:46:52.683]  And in this case, we had tapes taken to Hong Kong.
[02:46:56.465 --> 02:47:00.447]  On the afternoon of June 3rd, I mean, you could feel it.
[02:47:00.768 --> 02:47:05.751]  You could just feel things were going in a bad direction.
[02:47:07.709 --> 02:47:10.531]  Now our government does the exact same thing here.
[02:47:10.551 --> 02:47:11.552]  We've seen it all over.
[02:47:11.612 --> 02:47:14.975]  That evening, the soldiers began to move in.
[02:47:17.176 --> 02:47:30.426]  I could see below me little bicycle carts where people who'd been shot were dumped in the back and then the rider would pedal furiously taking these victims off to hospitals.
[02:47:30.987 --> 02:47:34.870]  One of my classmates came back from Camden Square and he told me
[02:47:44.071 --> 02:47:48.655]  And as dawn broke, the People's Liberation Army was in full control of the square.
[02:47:48.675 --> 02:47:50.376]  The student movement had been crushed.
[02:47:54.640 --> 02:47:57.562]  It happened the day after, in the morning.
[02:47:57.762 --> 02:48:02.266]  A column of tanks had started to leave Tiananmen Square.
[02:48:05.562 --> 02:48:09.945]  Out of nowhere, this man in a white shirt ran in front of the tank.
[02:48:10.786 --> 02:48:16.870]  The tank stopped, and for a heart-stopping four or five minutes, there was this extraordinary drama.
[02:48:19.398 --> 02:48:22.280]  The big question was, what would happen?
[02:48:23.001 --> 02:48:23.882]  Would he be run over?
[02:48:23.962 --> 02:48:24.742]  Would they shoot him?
[02:48:25.303 --> 02:48:27.104]  I saw that picture.
[02:48:27.124 --> 02:48:31.468]  A young man... We'll come back and finish up with this.
[02:48:32.128 --> 02:48:34.350]  I know here in America, they run over you with armored vehicles.
[02:48:34.390 --> 02:48:35.731]  And the news just says it's no big deal.
[02:48:36.852 --> 02:48:37.772]  We'll be right back, folks.
[02:48:37.792 --> 02:48:38.233]  Stay with us.
[02:48:46.701 --> 02:48:49.622]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:48:50.302 --> 02:48:51.603]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:48:51.803 --> 02:48:57.545]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:48:57.805 --> 02:49:03.067]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:49:03.367 --> 02:49:07.508]  Brace yourselves, as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:49:07.688 --> 02:49:11.469]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:49:11.729 --> 02:49:16.311]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:49:16.431 --> 02:49:22.695]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.755 --> 02:49:24.617]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[02:49:25.057 --> 02:49:27.138]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.
[02:49:27.239 --> 02:49:29.820]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:49:29.960 --> 02:49:33.643]  That's 1-888-253-3139.

[02:49:38.867 --> 02:49:40.888]  You see, Big Brother's afraid of this documentary.
[02:49:41.108 --> 02:49:42.609]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:49:42.789 --> 02:49:44.871]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:49:46.098 --> 02:49:47.719]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:49:47.839 --> 02:49:51.963]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:49:52.083 --> 02:49:54.965]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:49:55.045 --> 02:50:01.770]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:50:01.950 --> 02:50:04.952]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:50:05.153 --> 02:50:07.534]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:50:07.674 --> 02:50:12.278]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[02:50:12.318 --> 02:50:13.058]  We're good to go!
[02:50:37.206 --> 02:50:37.666]  803-4438.
[02:50:38.267 --> 02:50:39.607]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:50:40.027 --> 02:50:43.909]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[02:50:47.271 --> 02:50:53.214]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:50:53.454 --> 02:50:55.695]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[02:50:55.895 --> 02:51:02.238]  We provide outstanding products like ECAC, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[02:51:02.618 --> 02:51:03.219]  I think so.
[02:51:22.813 --> 02:51:23.433]  We're good to go.
[02:51:50.581 --> 02:51:52.482]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:51:52.963 --> 02:51:55.785]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:52:01.129 --> 02:52:06.032]  For many years, the military will grab my tapes, not allow them on base, consider some contraband.
[02:52:06.332 --> 02:52:08.894]  Now I'm writing a big article about that, I don't know why I haven't.
[02:52:09.274 --> 02:52:12.957]  But I mean, that's communist China, that's communist Russia, that's Nazi Germany.
[02:52:13.277 --> 02:52:14.178]  And this is book-burning.
[02:52:15.131 --> 02:52:17.212]  But Ron Paul, he's been singled out as well.
[02:52:17.272 --> 02:52:19.373]  He's quite evil giving speeches on the floor of the House.
[02:52:19.813 --> 02:52:22.054]  At the Capitol, you know, he's allowed to.
[02:52:22.094 --> 02:52:26.156]  He has free speeches as a citizen, but he's also a congressman who gets re-elected by great margins.
[02:52:26.576 --> 02:52:30.818]  But no, these cops and military now, they think, some of them, that freedom's illegal.
[02:52:30.838 --> 02:52:32.219]  They think it's freedom is not freedom.
[02:52:32.979 --> 02:52:35.440]  But we go back to Tienanmen Square and what happened there.
[02:52:36.300 --> 02:52:38.481]  Now China's worse than ever, folks.
[02:52:41.145 --> 02:52:42.907]  They kill whoever they want.
[02:52:43.467 --> 02:52:45.169]  And this is where we're going, folks.
[02:52:45.729 --> 02:52:46.670]  This is where we're going.
[02:52:48.151 --> 02:52:50.032]  The military's been trained to shoot protesters.
[02:52:51.133 --> 02:52:51.914]  Our police have.
[02:52:51.974 --> 02:52:53.535]  We're being warped and turned into this.
[02:52:53.555 --> 02:52:59.380]  And I just commend those Chinese students that stood up to get freedom and human dignity to demand it.
[02:52:59.500 --> 02:53:00.761]  But look what happened to them.
[02:53:01.341 --> 02:53:04.404]  And our Fortune 500 has just rewarded China for what they did.
[02:53:04.444 --> 02:53:05.585]  So let's finish up with this audio.
[02:53:06.528 --> 02:53:07.610]  I saw that picture.
[02:53:07.990 --> 02:53:09.612]  It's a young man standing in the tank.
[02:53:09.873 --> 02:53:11.955]  We never know who he is.
[02:53:13.057 --> 02:53:15.159]  Right now, nobody knows where he is.
[02:53:16.922 --> 02:53:18.303]  I was arrested in 1989, in July.
[02:53:22.586 --> 02:53:27.109]  Wang Dan spent most of the decade after Tiananmen in China in jail.
[02:53:27.450 --> 02:53:30.192]  He's now a graduate student at Harvard University.
[02:53:30.212 --> 02:53:39.799]  I was pretty proud of my role at that time because I think finally I can really do something to change history.
[02:53:40.239 --> 02:53:44.483]  That was our contribution, being there, reporting what was happening.
[02:53:44.803 --> 02:53:45.563]  It was historic.
[02:53:46.564 --> 02:53:50.207]  The People's Republic of China is going to be the next superpower.
[02:53:50.976 --> 02:54:00.118]  And what we were able to do was provide a window for the world to peek through and see that beneath the facade there is much ferment, much unrest.
[02:54:00.218 --> 02:54:00.878]  Absolutely.
[02:54:01.399 --> 02:54:16.842]  And understand folks that every week or two the farmers riot and burn down police stations and kill every government official they can get their hands on because of the corruption, because of the toxic waste dumping, because of all the bad things that are happening, because of their kids being used as slaves.
[02:54:17.562 --> 02:54:18.543]  And my heart goes out to them.
[02:54:18.563 --> 02:54:19.863]  They want freedom a lot more than we do.
[02:54:20.535 --> 02:54:21.696]  And we've got this freedom.
[02:54:21.736 --> 02:54:24.198]  What's left of them, we're letting these bastards take it away from us.
[02:54:25.059 --> 02:54:31.004]  I mean, everything America is, every veteran that's died for this country, supposedly died for free speech, and it's being flushed down the commode as well.
[02:54:31.424 --> 02:54:42.414]  They're telling us free speech zones and the rest of it, so none of you, whether you're a police officer, a peace officer, in the military, a lawyer, a district attorney listening right now, anybody in this government, it is your job, it is your duty.
[02:54:42.454 --> 02:54:44.055]  I don't care what the criminals above you tell you.
[02:54:44.315 --> 02:54:46.477]  You know what your duty is in your gut, you know this is true.
[02:54:46.697 --> 02:54:48.759]  It's to defend liberty and freedom here in America.
[02:54:49.361 --> 02:54:53.446]  Regardless, if it's somebody's speech you don't like, get that straight.
[02:54:54.447 --> 02:54:56.609]  Alright, I said I'd take a few final calls here.
[02:54:56.629 --> 02:55:08.462]  If you want to get the Evil Band videos, just go to InfoWars.com or call toll free to get them, 1-888-253-3139 and get them and make copies and never stop making copies.
[02:55:08.502 --> 02:55:10.124]  Real fast, Sam in Texas, go ahead sir.
[02:55:12.404 --> 02:55:12.945]  Sam's gone.
[02:55:12.985 --> 02:55:13.565]  Jeff in Illinois.
[02:55:13.585 --> 02:55:14.106]  Jeff, go ahead.
[02:55:14.126 --> 02:55:19.430]  Alright, new video exposing the Arkansas blood scandal.
[02:55:19.930 --> 02:55:26.836]  Another thing, Warren Buffett says we're becoming a nation of sharecroppers, ever increasing foreign debt.
[02:55:27.116 --> 02:55:27.897]  Yeah, I saw that.
[02:55:27.937 --> 02:55:35.483]  And yeah, there's a new video out about how the government, with Clinton, for eight years, knowingly shipped out HIV and hepatitis blood, knowing it would kill hundreds of thousands.
[02:55:36.406 --> 02:55:39.567]  Oh, but let's go arrest the makers of it!
[02:55:39.727 --> 02:55:42.228]  How dare them talk about a God creature like Clinton!
[02:55:42.428 --> 02:55:43.208]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:55:43.668 --> 02:55:44.869]  Yeah, that's been suppressed.
[02:55:45.209 --> 02:55:51.111]  But this foreign debt means that we're going to have foreign ownership of all of our properties.
[02:55:51.931 --> 02:55:59.754]  And the globalists are unwilling to tell us the truth about the high inflation, high interest that are going to result with it.
[02:55:59.834 --> 02:56:00.934]  Oh, there's no inflation!
[02:56:00.954 --> 02:56:01.794]  TV says so!
[02:56:03.455 --> 02:56:03.895]  Good day, sir.
[02:56:04.800 --> 02:56:06.761]  Uh, I really appreciate your call.
[02:56:06.821 --> 02:56:07.582]  Amazing points.
[02:56:07.602 --> 02:56:08.402]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:56:09.023 --> 02:56:11.304]  Sounded like you had a lot more to say, Jeff, but we're just flat out of time.
[02:56:11.924 --> 02:56:13.425]  Alright, in my new studio here, folks.

[02:56:18.228 --> 02:56:19.729]  We're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:19.969 --> 02:56:20.970]  God bless you all.
[02:56:21.030 --> 02:56:23.191]  Get out there and take on the New World Order!
