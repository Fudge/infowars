[00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:06.282]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.962 --> 00:00:08.022]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.722 --> 00:00:09.823]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.463 --> 00:00:11.303]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.063 --> 00:00:12.943]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.624 --> 00:00:17.265]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:21.906]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.193 --> 00:00:44.337]  Well, thank you for tuning in today, or tonight, or tomorrow, depending on what time zone you're listening to us in.
[00:00:44.357 --> 00:00:53.702]  I want to say hi to all the listeners across the United States and the rest of the planet, and that includes all the ships at sea and the aircraft in the air.
[00:00:53.722 --> 00:00:57.784]  That's right, we've got airline pilots listening to the broadcast.
[00:00:57.804 --> 00:00:58.924]  They routinely email me.
[00:00:58.944 --> 00:01:01.726]  I want to say hi to everybody and thank you for joining us.
[00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:05.888]  Well, it's coming up on six full days this afternoon.
[00:01:07.777 --> 00:01:11.398]  Since they pulled the feeding tube of Terri Schindler.
[00:01:12.638 --> 00:01:13.898]  Known as Terri Schiavo.
[00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:22.260]  And... I had thought that a couple of years ago when they pulled the tube it was for eight days.
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.601]  I've since been told that it was only for six and a half, maybe seven.
[00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:30.862]  And a lot of people die after six or seven days of no water.
[00:01:32.502 --> 00:01:34.783]  But she's been abused so long
[00:01:35.606 --> 00:01:42.992]  I've been through this several other times before that she's gotten, it seems, some resistance to it, but she will die.
[00:01:44.032 --> 00:01:50.657]  She will succumb in the next four or five days, if not the next few hours.
[00:01:51.658 --> 00:01:53.780]  You just don't know once you get to this point.
[00:01:55.361 --> 00:02:03.267]  You take a healthy person who's in really good shape and you take food and water away, especially water, for four or five days people die.
[00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:11.802]  It's kind of unusual, but that's how the body works, and if you're in really bad shape and been in that position for a long time, your body learns to cope with it.
[00:02:13.743 --> 00:02:17.705]  But I hope the pro-death crowd is really proud of themselves.
[00:02:18.626 --> 00:02:21.567]  So we'll get into the latest developments on Terry Schindler.
[00:02:22.748 --> 00:02:30.211]  Sergeant Matthew is going to be joining us coming up in the middle of the next hour.
[00:02:31.552 --> 00:02:33.273]  Sergeant Matthew Tertagula.
[00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.610]  U.S.
[00:02:34.931 --> 00:02:41.835]  Search and Rescue Task Force Critical Incident Stress Management Counselor and Debriefer.
[00:02:41.875 --> 00:02:43.976]  He was at Ground Zero day one.
[00:02:43.996 --> 00:02:47.718]  Could not wear a mask at sight because he had to talk.
[00:02:47.798 --> 00:02:50.940]  Now he has been super sick for three years.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.842]  Respiratory problems, teeth falling out.
[00:02:53.702 --> 00:02:55.723]  Many of the members of his team have died.
[00:02:55.743 --> 00:03:01.267]  He won two Gubernatorial Awards for his work at Ground Zero.
[00:03:02.623 --> 00:03:17.168]  And they admit that he and his team breathed masses of asbestos, but Bush blocked the funding for the firefighters, rescue workers, and police to get any medical treatment.
[00:03:18.168 --> 00:03:19.649]  That's right, you've got to pay for it yourself.
[00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:27.612]  So when he was done with his photo op, crying at ground zero with the fire chief, he left those people and left them behind.
[00:03:27.652 --> 00:03:31.333]  But I guess in a world of illusion, where illusion is king,
[00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:36.011]  I guess it's better that he smiled at them instead of taking care of them.
[00:03:36.031 --> 00:03:42.455]  If he had not gone and done the tertiary surface thing, they probably would have hated him.
[00:03:44.296 --> 00:03:46.297]  Even if he would have actually given them medical treatment.
[00:03:47.298 --> 00:03:58.225]  But by doing the con-artistly thing, inventing words now, con-artistly, con-man type thing, he is loved.
[00:03:58.305 --> 00:04:01.347]  It's like, don't really care about the troops when they're in Iraq,
[00:04:02.282 --> 00:04:14.505]  Say you care about them, put a ribbon on your car, fly a plastic Chinese flag, a flag made by slaves, a desecrated American flag, and don't care about the troops deep down.
[00:04:14.625 --> 00:04:19.127]  Just resign them over to his lordship and the corrupt government.
[00:04:20.767 --> 00:04:25.669]  The Lord Bush and this whole corrupt system, the pack of Democrats that are for the war as well.
[00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:30.650]  But this gentleman we're going to be talking to
[00:04:34.311 --> 00:04:36.652]  He's not just going to be talking about his health problems.
[00:04:36.672 --> 00:04:39.514]  He'll be talking about what they witnessed at Ground Zero.
[00:04:40.334 --> 00:04:44.416]  What it has to do with government involvement and prior knowledge.
[00:04:45.836 --> 00:04:47.537]  We'll also talk about the latest developments.
[00:04:47.557 --> 00:04:52.900]  There's been some big new developments with the Forced Psychological Testing, Forced Drugging Initiative, New Freedom.
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.521]  So that's coming up as well.
[00:04:55.581 --> 00:04:57.121]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.091 --> 00:05:05.033]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:05:05.693 --> 00:05:06.974]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:05:07.174 --> 00:05:12.938]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest, most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:05:13.198 --> 00:05:18.462]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:05:18.742 --> 00:05:20.363]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order
[00:05:20.503 --> 00:05:22.023]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[00:05:58.184 --> 00:06:00.286]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:06:01.346 --> 00:06:12.072]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:06:12.252 --> 00:06:19.837]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:20.097 --> 00:06:23.239]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:29.262]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:06:29.522 --> 00:06:35.685]  Made of durable lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:06:36.045 --> 00:06:39.927]  The Berculite is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:06:39.987 --> 00:06:41.868]  The water level is always visible.
[00:06:42.048 --> 00:06:48.011]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.

[00:07:01.431 --> 00:07:03.772]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:07:04.033 --> 00:07:07.875]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:07:08.195 --> 00:07:09.016]  Read the labels.
[00:07:09.436 --> 00:07:13.558]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:07:13.798 --> 00:07:17.981]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:07:18.361 --> 00:07:23.224]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:07:23.604 --> 00:07:27.186]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:07:27.386 --> 00:07:32.729]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:07:32.989 --> 00:07:35.730]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.

[00:08:00.964 --> 00:08:06.006]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.407 --> 00:08:08.608]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:22.397 --> 00:08:44.004]  Well, I hate to say I told you so, but a couple days ago, right after we had the latest tragic mass school shooting, this time at an Indian Reservation public school, I said in every other case of a woman drowning, five of her children, or a woman sawing, or
[00:08:44.770 --> 00:09:12.488]  Newborn babies' arms off, or somebody going in and shooting their grandparents or their parents, or Harrison Clybold going in, the mass shooters, snipers up in the Maryland-Virginia area, Larry Ashbrook who shot up the Baptist Youth Meeting in Fort Worth,
[00:09:13.297 --> 00:09:15.018]  I mean, every time!
[00:09:16.118 --> 00:09:42.625]  I haven't found a case, unless it's gangland, you know, turf wars, which is the majority of the shootings, but out of all of these senseless, random killings, where you have people just going into a grocery store, or going into a public school, or going into a factory and shooting people, I mean, in every case, it's scores of them!
[00:09:44.133 --> 00:09:52.636]  Every time, a week later, it comes out that they were on a serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
[00:09:54.396 --> 00:09:55.297]  SSRIs.
[00:09:56.577 --> 00:10:06.220]  And here is the San Francisco Chronicle, today, and now they're admitting that, okay, he was on Prozac.
[00:10:08.832 --> 00:10:16.194]  The clues were all there, school shooter, depicted as deeply disturbed, ignored teen.
[00:10:17.695 --> 00:10:20.876]  And then they go into the article to admit that he was on Prozac.
[00:10:22.416 --> 00:10:31.979]  Now the argument of the pro-drug forces is that, well, it's because they're already mentally ill or depressed,
[00:10:32.992 --> 00:10:34.633]  That's why we put them on the drugs.
[00:10:34.733 --> 00:10:47.858]  So it's not the fault of the drug, it's that we just have a pool of people that are depressed, and we've rightfully identified them as having problems, and so we put them on drugs to help them, and alas, the drugs didn't get to them soon enough.
[00:10:49.258 --> 00:10:54.220]  Well, I think in what, the last year or so, I've seen, it's gotta be ten different studies.
[00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:55.221]  It's a whole bunch of them.
[00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:57.381]  The last month, there's been two of them.
[00:10:57.401 --> 00:11:00.382]  It's gotta be more than ten.
[00:11:00.623 --> 00:11:01.483]  It's a whole bunch.
[00:11:02.185 --> 00:11:24.967]  Of major university studies, private studies, where they'll give LUVOX, where they'll give Prozac, they'll give the entire family of these SSRIs to people who are, quote, depressed or angry or having schizoid delusions.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:35.222]  And they found statistically that the Prozac type drugs actually make them more violent, more suicidal, worse.
[00:11:35.422 --> 00:11:51.065]  So, in these studies they've been doing, they actually take the pools of people who already have problems, and they give them a sugar pill,
[00:11:52.972 --> 00:11:57.994]  They give one control group, and it looks like a Prozac pill, looks like the pill in question.
[00:11:58.414 --> 00:12:01.995]  They give them a sugar pill, and it has a better effect.
[00:12:02.035 --> 00:12:11.159]  They actually get better off the placebo, mind over matter, than they do off of the real Prozac.
[00:12:11.179 --> 00:12:18.601]  But they don't just get better with sugar, and then they don't get as better on Prozac.
[00:12:18.621 --> 00:12:18.821]  No, no.
[00:12:18.861 --> 00:12:20.742]  They get worse on Prozac.
[00:12:22.947 --> 00:12:24.568]  And then you take something like St.
[00:12:24.648 --> 00:12:25.488]  John's Wort.
[00:12:27.048 --> 00:12:29.349]  Several big studies out on this in the last few months.
[00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:32.610]  They've done them in Europe, they've done them here in the U.S.
[00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.491]  Two different studies, same results, almost identical.
[00:12:36.051 --> 00:12:38.492]  In double-blind studies, you give somebody St.
[00:12:38.692 --> 00:12:49.976]  John's Wort who's depressed, particularly with the different types of real depression that are associated with low light levels that people get during the dark of winter,
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:54.763]  You know, there are real problems out there that, hey, you need to be outside more.
[00:12:55.523 --> 00:12:56.785]  You need to buy a happy light.
[00:12:56.845 --> 00:12:58.326]  Those, by the way, really work.
[00:12:58.346 --> 00:13:02.189]  You put them in your house, they generate kind of a type of sunlight.
[00:13:04.211 --> 00:13:05.472]  The point is, I'm digressing.
[00:13:07.173 --> 00:13:08.054]  They gave them St.
[00:13:08.114 --> 00:13:14.479]  John's wort versus serotonin reuptake inhibitors and St.
[00:13:14.579 --> 00:13:15.300]  John's wort
[00:13:16.281 --> 00:13:23.544]  In the double-blind studies was three times more effective than the Prozac class of drugs.
[00:13:25.185 --> 00:13:26.945]  Now I'm not saying run out and take St.
[00:13:26.985 --> 00:13:27.606]  John's Wort.
[00:13:29.266 --> 00:13:37.370]  By and large I don't think drugs are very good unless you've got a really bad sore throat, or having trouble doing your radio broadcast, you've got to pop a couple of Tylenol.
[00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:45.133]  Tylenol's not really good for your liver, and who knows what other effects it has, but you know, you've got to do it, you've got to do it.
[00:13:45.965 --> 00:13:48.347]  I got a big ol' cup of coffee right here in front of me.
[00:13:48.927 --> 00:13:54.071]  Which is a very serious drug and has some health benefits and some health problems.
[00:13:57.234 --> 00:14:05.560]  But certainly, if you've got a depressed teenager and getting them in sports or getting them to, you know, go out and join a paintball team.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.604]  I mean, normally competitive stuff will get a kid out of depression from the studies I've seen in just common sense.
[00:14:11.325 --> 00:14:12.445]  Oh, try putting them on St.
[00:14:12.486 --> 00:14:15.568]  John's Wort before you go put them on Prozac.
[00:14:16.167 --> 00:14:18.329]  I mean, certainly don't ever put them on Prozac.
[00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:23.833]  Back in the 1980s, they had the trials of Prozac.
[00:14:23.873 --> 00:14:28.676]  And I mean, I knew this ten years ago when I first got on the air, so it must not be a secret.
[00:14:29.797 --> 00:14:35.041]  It's just now starting to come out in the last year, where most Americans have now heard about it.
[00:14:35.581 --> 00:14:44.328]  But in their own trials of Prozac, you know, the big forerunner, and still the preeminent drug of choice of the different combinations of these fluoride-based pills,
[00:14:46.348 --> 00:14:48.789]  Fluoride molecules type derivatives.
[00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:57.651]  They had the studies back in the early 80's and they covered it up.
[00:14:58.591 --> 00:15:07.613]  They knew that you took depressed people and you put them on this, a large percentage of them, a sizable minority have psychotic breaks.
[00:15:09.393 --> 00:15:12.914]  I mean I've talked to so many psychologists and psychiatrists on this radio broadcast
[00:15:13.993 --> 00:15:15.274]  I've talked to so many police.
[00:15:15.394 --> 00:15:17.055]  I've talked to so many experts who've seen it.
[00:15:17.595 --> 00:15:23.138]  You pull up to a house and a woman's dancing naked on top of a roof with two butcher knives, stabbing herself?
[00:15:23.799 --> 00:15:30.282]  The cops know they're going to find a Prozac bottle or a Luvox bottle in her medicine cabinet.
[00:15:30.322 --> 00:15:32.663]  Cops pull up and the baby's got its arms cut off?
[00:15:33.344 --> 00:15:35.125]  Cops know they're going to find a Prozac bottle.
[00:15:36.586 --> 00:15:40.608]  I mean, folks, psychotropics are
[00:15:41.787 --> 00:15:46.529]  A major branch coming out of the hallucinogen tree.
[00:15:48.469 --> 00:15:51.070]  They are classified as hallucinogenic.
[00:15:52.931 --> 00:15:54.031]  You ever been daydreaming?
[00:15:55.532 --> 00:15:56.692]  You ever been looking out the window?
[00:15:57.693 --> 00:15:58.913]  I remember doing this in school.
[00:16:00.614 --> 00:16:02.214]  When people were reading their reports.
[00:16:04.995 --> 00:16:09.217]  And you're looking out the window and you catch yourself kind of in la la land and ten minutes has passed.
[00:16:10.945 --> 00:16:15.069]  That's the exact same brainwaves that these Prozac-type drugs put you into.
[00:16:15.089 --> 00:16:19.092]  And so, yeah, for most people, you take it, suddenly you're happy.
[00:16:20.773 --> 00:16:22.655]  Just like taking LSD, you're happy.
[00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:26.158]  Until the 50th time you take it, and you have a bad trip.
[00:16:27.759 --> 00:16:33.944]  Talk about the cases, real cases of people jumping out of windows, eating their fingers, thinking they're Cheetos.
[00:16:35.806 --> 00:16:39.069]  Police get there, and the person's eating three of their five fingers off,
[00:16:40.251 --> 00:16:41.652]  Chewing, going, mmm, Cheeto.
[00:16:42.913 --> 00:16:43.833]  These are real cases.
[00:16:45.314 --> 00:16:46.995]  People gouge their eyeballs out.
[00:16:50.397 --> 00:16:52.678]  But see, LSD affects other areas of the brain.
[00:16:53.299 --> 00:16:56.320]  And so, you might see pink elephants.
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.422]  You might see the walls breathing.
[00:17:01.203 --> 00:17:02.724]  You don't take LSD every day.
[00:17:02.764 --> 00:17:02.964]  No.
[00:17:03.624 --> 00:17:03.765]  No.
[00:17:04.992 --> 00:17:08.154]  The Prozac type drugs just put you into a dreamlike state.
[00:17:08.734 --> 00:17:13.016]  So when you have a bad trip, look out!
[00:17:16.538 --> 00:17:18.839]  There's going to be hell to pay.
[00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:23.762]  That's what we're turning this planet into, a literal Hades.
[00:17:26.303 --> 00:17:33.307]  And so I look at these reports, and sure enough, I mean folks, the next time there's a mass shooting, I mean we're batting
[00:17:35.279 --> 00:17:36.399]  A perfect score here.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.621]  I mean, we're hitting a hole-in-one every time here.
[00:17:41.241 --> 00:17:45.222]  I've never seen a case where it wasn't gang-related.
[00:17:46.383 --> 00:17:48.984]  Where a mass shooting, the person wasn't on these drugs.
[00:17:49.444 --> 00:17:57.727]  I mean, even when it's the angry employee that goes in the post office, or goes in the tire factory, and shoots his boss, and still, they're on these drugs.
[00:17:59.868 --> 00:18:03.669]  And you know, maybe the psychologists that argue for this, maybe they're right in a way.
[00:18:04.657 --> 00:18:14.661]  Even though the studies say they're wrong, maybe in a way they're right when they say, well, I'll tell you what, these people are already disturbed and so it's not the drug's fault.
[00:18:16.322 --> 00:18:18.203]  Clearly, these are disturbed individuals.
[00:18:19.784 --> 00:18:27.747]  So we do have to add that into the equation, but it's the drugs that push them over the edge and knock out their impulse control.
[00:18:31.405 --> 00:18:38.329]  So, it's not a good idea, you know, oh here, let's give some LSD to the guy that's already got problems.
[00:18:39.129 --> 00:18:52.936]  Here, let's give, and then in some of the other shootings, very few of them, usually they're on both, they're on the amphetamine type drugs.
[00:18:54.617 --> 00:18:57.398]  In fact, we've never seen one where they were just on the amphetamine drugs.
[00:18:57.478 --> 00:18:58.959]  Actually, they're usually on a couple of them.
[00:19:00.154 --> 00:19:01.834]  I think about Harris and Kleibold.
[00:19:03.115 --> 00:19:03.415]  I don't know.
[00:19:03.455 --> 00:19:09.836]  I don't want to belabor this all day long, but I know so many people that have put their children on these drugs.
[00:19:11.316 --> 00:19:12.357]  I know so many people.
[00:19:12.377 --> 00:19:17.278]  You know, they pulled FinFin off the market because it made your heart valves disintegrate.
[00:19:17.778 --> 00:19:21.258]  They pulled that other drug off the market for arthritis because it messes up your arteries.
[00:19:22.279 --> 00:19:29.220]  And the problems associated with those real medical drugs are much smaller in the aggregate
[00:19:30.091 --> 00:19:32.793]  Compared to what serotonin reuptake inhibitors are doing.
[00:19:37.036 --> 00:19:39.617]  And so, why aren't they pulling them?
[00:19:40.518 --> 00:19:53.787]  Because the government and the people that control the government, the crime syndicate, they have a desire with the mind sciences to drug the entire population.
[00:19:53.807 --> 00:19:54.887]  That's their stated goal.
[00:19:56.849 --> 00:19:58.330]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:58.810]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:06.891]  We've all heard about the benefits of infrared light therapy, but never have we heard of anything as amazing as this.
[00:20:07.091 --> 00:20:14.656]  Diametics, the leading authority on polychromatic infrared diode therapy in the U.S., now offers its patented Paynex 2000 to the public.
[00:20:14.756 --> 00:20:21.359]  The Paynex 2000 uses the same technology NASA uses aboard the space shuttle, and the same technology used by the Navy SEALs.
[00:20:21.579 --> 00:20:22.920]  Now it's available to you.
[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:29.684]  The Paynex 2000 is FDA cleared for joint aches and pains, increases circulation, and relaxes those achy muscles.
[00:20:30.004 --> 00:20:30.505]  I think so.
[00:20:54.023 --> 00:21:03.788]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:21:04.108 --> 00:21:06.909]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:21:07.169 --> 00:21:11.331]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:21:11.751 --> 00:21:12.592]  So what do you do?
[00:21:12.892 --> 00:21:17.474]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:21:17.954 --> 00:21:20.075]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:21:20.575 --> 00:21:35.258]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:21:35.298 --> 00:21:42.360]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:47.124]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.

[00:21:52.168 --> 00:21:54.310]  Hi folks, Jack Browner from Midas Resources.
[00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:55.291]  The real money folks.
[00:22:09.201 --> 00:22:11.143]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[00:22:11.624 --> 00:22:12.605]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:22:12.685 --> 00:22:13.886]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[00:22:14.107 --> 00:22:14.547]  A 5% increase.
[00:22:15.148 --> 00:22:17.570]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:20.774]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:36.074]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s, a 16% increase in real money.
[00:22:36.695 --> 00:22:39.757]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[00:22:40.297 --> 00:22:45.441]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:46.742 --> 00:22:50.665]  Remember, gold is liquid, private, and portable.
[00:22:51.365 --> 00:22:54.288]  Call now before your buying power shrinks even more dramatically.
[00:22:54.728 --> 00:22:56.149]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.655 --> 00:23:08.620]  Did you know that sugar, that sweet and simple, inoffensive-looking, refined substance you use in your coffee and cupcakes actually reduces your body's ability to protect you?
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.261]  It suppresses your immune system!
[00:23:10.501 --> 00:23:11.141]  Now check this out.
[00:23:11.501 --> 00:23:14.943]  The average American consumes 2 to 3 pounds of sugar on average each week.
[00:23:15.264 --> 00:23:17.385]  That's about 120 pounds of sugar per year!
[00:23:17.905 --> 00:23:20.568]  Do you know what happens when your immune system is compromised?
[00:23:20.828 --> 00:23:21.609]  Your health suffers.
[00:23:21.849 --> 00:23:22.490]  It's that simple.
[00:23:22.831 --> 00:23:24.612]  Here's how you can help your body win the fight.
[00:23:24.793 --> 00:23:26.775]  With the dietary supplement of Garicus Bio.
[00:23:27.235 --> 00:23:35.164]  The dietary supplement of Garicus Bio was developed so that you can fight back again and again by giving your immune system a chance to be the first line of defense it was meant to be.

[00:23:43.427 --> 00:23:43.947]  A Garicus Bio.

[00:23:45.588 --> 00:23:46.368]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit thepowermall.com.
[00:24:08.459 --> 00:24:21.690]  Highly decorated 9-11 rescuer, Sergeant Matthew Tartaglia, will be joining us to talk about the lies of 9-11 when he saw it ground zero.
[00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:25.292]  The health effects on himself and his team.
[00:24:26.373 --> 00:24:28.415]  We've got Dr. Breeding joining us.
[00:24:29.776 --> 00:24:31.357]  Coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:24:31.978 --> 00:24:35.741]  He's at the Texas Legislature fighting Lord Bush and the Democrats.
[00:24:36.943 --> 00:24:39.604]  On the new Freedom Initiative, they're trying to pass it to the state right now.
[00:24:40.024 --> 00:24:43.906]  They got the federal funding, and now they're passing it through all over the country.
[00:24:44.526 --> 00:24:52.589]  Forced psychological testing of every school-aged child right through 18 years of age, and Illinois wants to start with adults.
[00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:56.291]  The drug companies wrote up the guidelines.
[00:24:56.331 --> 00:25:05.815]  By the way, the new class of drugs they're going to be pushing, because the old ones are running out, their patents are ending, so they're becoming generic, so there's not the big profit in forcing them on your children.
[00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:17.442]  Now they're shifting over to these drugs that don't just engage in serotonin reuptake inhibitors, but affect other chemicals in the brain, other base chemicals.
[00:25:18.782 --> 00:25:22.103]  So it's going from bad to worse.
[00:25:24.263 --> 00:25:29.904]  Going from purgatory directly into the 9th circle of Dante's Inferno.
[00:25:30.945 --> 00:25:32.385]  We'll tell you about that Texas bill.
[00:25:33.246 --> 00:25:35.327]  By the way, this is going on in a bunch of other states.
[00:25:35.407 --> 00:25:46.514]  States all over the country that have legislatures in session, that are in legislative sessions, are right now trying to pass similar pieces of legislation.
[00:25:47.014 --> 00:25:52.177]  So, you better get on the ball, or you'll be wondering why they're knocking on your door, even if you're homeschooled.
[00:25:53.438 --> 00:25:54.438]  Hello, the Van is here.
[00:25:54.458 --> 00:25:56.760]  We're here to take your child to psychological evaluation.
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:58.481]  It's all part of the freedom of America.
[00:25:59.361 --> 00:26:02.283]  Why don't you go put some psychologists on the border?
[00:26:03.758 --> 00:26:05.438]  Why don't you do something about our sovereignty?
[00:26:06.038 --> 00:26:07.199]  Now it's the law!
[00:26:07.279 --> 00:26:08.239]  It's conservative!
[00:26:10.379 --> 00:26:10.859]  Oh boy.
[00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:12.960]  Mush did it.
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.060]  It must be good.
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:18.421]  It's the same government that puts fluoride in your water.
[00:26:18.441 --> 00:26:22.402]  Doesn't matter if there's thousands of studies saying it's deadly.
[00:26:23.362 --> 00:26:24.262]  Just drink it.
[00:26:24.282 --> 00:26:27.202]  Because the government says it's good.
[00:26:28.203 --> 00:26:29.723]  The government wouldn't lie to you.
[00:26:31.221 --> 00:26:34.183]  The hydration death called cruel and agonizing.
[00:26:34.283 --> 00:26:37.245]  Expert debunks myth of no food, water being painless.
[00:26:37.745 --> 00:26:38.546]  Way to die.
[00:26:38.566 --> 00:26:41.007]  Got a World Net Daily article here.
[00:26:41.067 --> 00:26:45.590]  Meanwhile, there's an Associated Press article with an expert saying it's a wonderful way to die.
[00:26:46.911 --> 00:26:48.112]  Oh, it's so compassionate.
[00:26:48.212 --> 00:26:49.453]  She doesn't feel any pain.
[00:26:50.073 --> 00:26:59.579]  And of course, this doctor that Jeb Bush appointed is the one traipsing around saying she's a vegetable when she's not a vegetable.
[00:27:00.498 --> 00:27:08.063]  A bunch of other neurologists and experts have looked at her and said that she's not in a vegetative or consistent, persistent vegetative state.
[00:27:08.103 --> 00:27:16.608]  The poor lady that we've been fighting for for four years, since I learned of her plight, is now six days into having food and water denied.
[00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:23.473]  And they're trying to go back to the Supreme Court now, trying to exhaust every avenue.
[00:27:25.414 --> 00:27:27.175]  Jeb Bush could order the
[00:27:29.622 --> 00:27:33.805]  CPS, which also has its adult division in.
[00:27:35.086 --> 00:27:40.489]  But see, there's nothing in it for them to protect old people in nursing homes or paralyzed women.
[00:27:40.509 --> 00:27:42.290]  No, no, they want the future.
[00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:49.375]  They want the children to drug them and dumb them down and turn them into little sociopaths to serve the corporate board.
[00:27:50.315 --> 00:27:56.399]  They could care less about really protecting the old people who really are abused in this country.
[00:27:58.701 --> 00:27:58.981]  Oh, no.
[00:28:00.182 --> 00:28:00.963]  I mean, you imagine.
[00:28:02.223 --> 00:28:18.175]  I don't recommend you try it, because I'm against abusing animals, but why don't you take a dog out and, uh, you know, let's say your dog gets hit by a car, its neck's broken, they'll put it in a cage out in your front yard for three or four days, no water or food, instead of, you know, even putting it down.
[00:28:19.055 --> 00:28:29.723]  Just, just, this isn't even a debate about euthanasia, which, by the way, I'm against, because then it always leads to what we see now, and the Nazis were for it, and they didn't have very many good ideas, did they, folks?
[00:28:30.956 --> 00:28:36.599]  But, um, I don't know, it's just so disgusting.
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:44.483]  The debate should be, because this is a debate they can't win, how they're killing her.
[00:28:45.063 --> 00:28:47.584]  I mean, literally, folks, they're denying her food and water.
[00:28:47.964 --> 00:28:54.668]  And I know it's been said 5,000 times, but something you can't do to a convicted child molester.
[00:28:55.648 --> 00:28:57.349]  You can't have cruel, unusual punishment.
[00:28:59.528 --> 00:29:10.430]  You couldn't imagine if they took, let's say, an axe murderer or a bank robber who shot a bank teller, and imagine if they took them and dehydrated them to death.
[00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:14.431]  Imagine the outcry from the ACLU and all these people.
[00:29:14.911 --> 00:29:16.932]  But you don't hear anything for this poor lady.
[00:29:19.312 --> 00:29:29.234]  So, uh, if no one goes to her rescue, I mean, I've seen the images on the news wires of little children being arrested trying to bring her glasses of water.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:40.587]  And that's how sick and perverted things have gotten that now children are trying to bring her water.
[00:29:42.188 --> 00:29:49.034]  And there are the police always protecting the New World Order, always following their unconstitutional orders.
[00:29:51.616 --> 00:29:54.638]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.539 --> 00:29:58.221]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.258 --> 00:30:02.299]  Are you a diabetic?
[00:30:02.399 --> 00:30:05.000]  Do you have Medicare or private insurance?
[00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:09.262]  If you do, here's some great news that could save you time and money.
[00:30:09.462 --> 00:30:15.425]  If you're required to test your blood sugar, iCare may be able to provide your supplies at no cost to you.
[00:30:15.525 --> 00:30:16.326]  Here's why.
[00:30:16.726 --> 00:30:22.249]  We work with Medicare and most private insurances to determine your maximum coverage benefits.
[00:30:22.569 --> 00:30:25.651]  So we can ship your supplies free right to your door.
[00:30:25.871 --> 00:30:28.453]  So I want you to call us right now.
[00:30:28.473 --> 00:30:29.133]  800-419-2335.
[00:30:29.153 --> 00:30:29.514]  800-419-2335.
[00:30:29.614 --> 00:30:39.360]  So if you have diabetes, we make it real easy for you here at iCare.
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:44.143]  We are an approved Medicare provider and we do all the paperwork.
[00:30:44.223 --> 00:30:45.984]  So all you have to do is call.
[00:30:46.204 --> 00:30:46.985]  Toll free at
[00:30:47.125 --> 00:30:47.445]  That's 1-800-419-2335.
[00:30:47.465 --> 00:30:47.505]  800-419-2335.
[00:30:47.525 --> 00:30:47.745]  That's 1-800-419-2335.
[00:30:47.785 --> 00:30:48.806]  Remember, at iCare, we care.
[00:30:48.826 --> 00:30:51.128]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:31:04.236 --> 00:31:09.179]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:09.419 --> 00:31:13.782]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.082 --> 00:31:22.987]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:23.207 --> 00:31:26.849]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:31:27.109 --> 00:31:32.132]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:32.432 --> 00:31:39.175]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:31:39.655 --> 00:31:40.296]  What about you?
[00:31:40.956 --> 00:31:45.838]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35.
[00:31:45.878 --> 00:31:46.299]  A $14 savings.
[00:31:46.359 --> 00:31:47.379]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:31:47.519 --> 00:31:49.420]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:32:01.287 --> 00:32:04.449]  With gardening season coming up, you'll soon be building your compost pile.
[00:32:04.629 --> 00:32:07.350]  And that's why there's a great gardening tool I have to tell you about.
[00:32:07.531 --> 00:32:08.931]  It's called the Compost Twin.
[00:32:09.091 --> 00:32:18.997]  Gardeners know the importance of composting, but we're all too familiar with the back-breaking work of turning the compost pile with a pitchfork and messy accumulation of kitchen scraps while you wait for a batch of compost to cook.
[00:32:19.217 --> 00:32:20.998]  So Mantis developed the Compost Twin
[00:32:21.238 --> 00:32:25.082]  The Compost Twin is the only composter with two 10 bushel bins on one machine.
[00:32:25.343 --> 00:32:29.788]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.
[00:32:29.968 --> 00:32:33.812]  Plus, mixing the compost is a breeze with the Compost Twin's easy turn gear system.
[00:32:34.052 --> 00:32:40.179]  And with a second chamber, you can continually add kitchen scraps and garden waste without disturbing the composting process in the first chamber.
[00:32:40.419 --> 00:32:43.220]  No more mess, no more odors, no more hard work.
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.720]  Deal direct with Mantis and get a no-hassle, one-year money-back guarantee.
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:50.701]  Call Mantis now for a free video and information kit on the Compost Twin.
[00:32:50.821 --> 00:32:52.022]  Call toll-free 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[00:32:52.142 --> 00:32:52.602]  That's 1-866-833-M-A-N-T-I-S.
[00:33:17.664 --> 00:33:23.346]  Taiwan president to join march against China's new law.
[00:33:24.166 --> 00:33:33.549]  China's passed a law authorizing themselves to brutally attack the free nation of Taiwan, or the Republic of China.
[00:33:34.466 --> 00:33:35.006]  As it's called.
[00:33:35.046 --> 00:33:35.847]  Here's another article.
[00:33:35.987 --> 00:33:36.987]  Chicago Tribune.
[00:33:37.428 --> 00:33:40.769]  Surveillance cameras to cover every inch of Chicago town.
[00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:44.311]  And of course there's face scanning and license plate reading.
[00:33:44.431 --> 00:33:46.892]  You talk about Brave New World.
[00:33:47.252 --> 00:33:48.053]  This is it.
[00:33:49.894 --> 00:33:52.815]  More on Wolfowitz and his World Bank appointment.
[00:33:52.835 --> 00:33:55.397]  And of course the Terry Schindler case.
[00:33:56.117 --> 00:34:00.019]  And in the middle of the next hour, we have a rescue worker, highly decorated,
[00:34:00.723 --> 00:34:05.526]  from the World Trade Center disaster to expose what really happened there.
[00:34:05.546 --> 00:34:12.151]  Not just how they weren't giving medical treatment for the asbestos, but how the official story is a front.
[00:34:12.751 --> 00:34:14.933]  You don't want to miss that coming up in the middle of the next hour.
[00:34:15.373 --> 00:34:23.819]  Here in about four or five minutes we're going to be going to Dr. John Breeding, who is here at the state level in Texas fighting the New Freedom Initiative.
[00:34:24.378 --> 00:34:30.925]  The Congress passed late last year, late in the session, the forced psychological testing.
[00:34:31.506 --> 00:34:36.170]  But I also want to get his response to what we knew was going to come out.
[00:34:36.211 --> 00:34:37.031]  It always does.
[00:34:37.352 --> 00:34:38.533]  Literally always does.
[00:34:39.534 --> 00:34:47.042]  The mass shooter up at the public school at the Indian Reservation in northern Minnesota was on Prozac.
[00:34:48.675 --> 00:34:49.836]  So that's coming up in a few minutes.
[00:34:50.677 --> 00:34:56.461]  First off, listen, my new film, Martial Law 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State, is out.
[00:34:57.121 --> 00:34:59.163]  It's the best video I've ever produced.
[00:35:00.303 --> 00:35:02.404]  It is two hours, 35 minutes long.
[00:35:02.464 --> 00:35:10.849]  It covers the police state, the sound weapons, the military on the streets, the surveillance blimps, reporters being arrested at the RNC.
[00:35:11.309 --> 00:35:12.630]  That's the first 35 minutes.
[00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:18.573]  Then we spend an hour on 9-11, the most powerful 9-11 film out there, bar none, just in that hour.
[00:35:19.914 --> 00:35:22.115]  We detail how the globalists carried out the attacks.
[00:35:23.529 --> 00:35:32.815]  And then the last hour we get into the Order of Death, the Bush-Nazi connection, the Arnold-Nazi connection, the Bohemian Grove-Skull and Bones-Nazi connection.
[00:35:33.415 --> 00:35:45.163]  We tie it all together and show you the ideology, the philosophy of these psychopaths and their religion of death that matches their souls.
[00:35:46.744 --> 00:35:49.026]  It is an unusual film, to say the least.
[00:35:49.086 --> 00:35:49.706]  It is different.
[00:35:50.286 --> 00:35:51.007]  It is the truth.
[00:35:51.207 --> 00:35:52.548]  It is where the evidence led me.
[00:35:53.266 --> 00:35:54.766]  And it's $25.95.
[00:35:55.747 --> 00:35:59.068]  If you order three or more of any of the 12 films I produce, they drop down to $19.95.
[00:35:59.688 --> 00:36:01.809]  That's an $18 discount.
[00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:04.329]  But I suggest all of you get Martial Law today.
[00:36:04.849 --> 00:36:06.270]  Do not wait, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:10.131]  Go to InfoWars.com to order via the Safe, Secure Online Shopping Cart.
[00:36:10.151 --> 00:36:13.472]  You can watch lengthy clips of the film there, of course, before you order it.

[00:36:18.057 --> 00:36:18.117]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:36:18.157 --> 00:36:20.638]  Six months in the making and it is now out.
[00:36:20.658 --> 00:36:20.698]  888-253-3139
[00:36:32.098 --> 00:36:36.079]  Or, as I said, order via the Safe, Secure, Online Shopping Cart at InfoWars.com.

[00:36:44.602 --> 00:36:49.523]  And last but not least, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:36:49.543 --> 00:36:51.643]  You can go to PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:36:53.997 --> 00:37:04.846]  And watch all 12 of my films, read my book, Paul Watson's book, dozens of other films, my weekly TV show, my best audio interviews, like the one you're about to hear, it'll be posted there with Dr. Breeding.
[00:37:05.366 --> 00:37:09.650]  PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day, monthly and yearly subscriptions.
[00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:12.012]  We only charge that to pay for the bandwidth.
[00:37:12.515 --> 00:37:15.037]  PrisonPlanet.tv, get instant access to all of it.
[00:37:15.558 --> 00:37:18.120]  Alright, bring her up on the air with us here real quick.
[00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:19.121]  I appreciate her joining us.
[00:37:19.422 --> 00:37:24.246]  This is Debbie Morrow of New Millennium Concepts of the Big Berkey.
[00:37:24.847 --> 00:37:27.429]  And it's made right here in America.
[00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:29.291]  And I have an article here.
[00:37:29.931 --> 00:37:32.374]  Fluoride, stupidity and population control.
[00:37:33.197 --> 00:37:38.240]  Controversial fluoride is one of the basic ingredients in Prozac and sarin nerve gas.
[00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:43.142]  But that didn't stop the Pentagon lobbying to put it in our water 50 years ago.
[00:37:43.922 --> 00:37:46.184]  That's just one of the things you don't want to drink.
[00:37:47.304 --> 00:37:50.006]  The Ritalin in Prozac is in many of the water supplies.
[00:37:50.066 --> 00:37:51.766]  The herbicides, the pesticides.
[00:37:52.507 --> 00:37:58.930]  If you're drinking, folks, after you've been drinking filtered water, really purified water for a few weeks, then try to drink tap water.
[00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:00.531]  It is disgusting.
[00:38:02.432 --> 00:38:03.833]  You can't trust the bottled water.
[00:38:03.893 --> 00:38:05.714]  I mean, there's so many articles on that, it's crazy.
[00:38:06.075 --> 00:38:07.135]  Debbie, thanks for joining us.
[00:38:07.175 --> 00:38:09.076]  Real quick, tell folks how to order the Big Berkey.
[00:38:09.757 --> 00:38:11.838]  Give me a call toll free at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:38:11.858 --> 00:38:12.478]  That's 1-888-803-4438.
[00:38:12.538 --> 00:38:17.121]  Or they can go to our website, which is berkeywater.com.
[00:38:17.141 --> 00:38:18.562]  And it's spelled B-E-R-K-E-Y-W-A-T-E-R.com.
[00:38:30.683 --> 00:38:41.865]  And Debbie, I mean, I don't like to sit here and beat this drum, but I know so many good friends and family that still drink tap water, and they know how bad the water is.
[00:38:41.905 --> 00:38:53.508]  I mean, anybody can go buy water testers at the pool supply place, even if you don't have a pool, just go buy it and test the water, and I mean, it is, it is just, it's horrible!
[00:38:54.368 --> 00:38:58.949]  That's right, and by filtering your water, you're taking control of your life.
[00:38:59.069 --> 00:38:59.769]  You know what
[00:39:00.393 --> 00:39:02.674]  You're getting, and that's the least we could do.
[00:39:02.694 --> 00:39:25.641]  You know, you were talking about, you know, the lady on the news in Florida is just so terrible, and I was thinking yesterday when I heard about that, how so many of my customers call and they thank me so much for fresh water, and when I heard her parents on the radio begging not to let their daughter die of thirst, it broke my heart, you know?
[00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:29.791]  So, please take control of your water.
[00:39:30.872 --> 00:39:32.453]  Water is life, folks.
[00:39:32.493 --> 00:39:41.078]  And they've got a bunch of different units, from little bitty hand-held things to beautiful systems that sit on your table, or your desk, or out in the garage, wherever.
[00:39:41.698 --> 00:39:43.059]  They're really easy to put together.
[00:39:43.819 --> 00:39:46.421]  I've bought, I don't know, about seven or eight of these over the years.
[00:39:47.041 --> 00:39:48.322]  I own three of them myself.
[00:39:48.382 --> 00:39:49.863]  I've given three or four as gifts.
[00:39:50.403 --> 00:39:52.044]  I guess I've actually given more than that as gifts.
[00:39:52.728 --> 00:39:55.134]  I've given them to family, to special friends of mine.
[00:39:55.535 --> 00:39:57.980]  You really need to stop drinking the water.
[00:39:58.702 --> 00:40:02.791]  I mean, look at how many other bad things the government's been caught doing just from incompetence.
[00:40:03.744 --> 00:40:09.549]  Much less via premeditated activities.
[00:40:09.569 --> 00:40:09.889]  888-803-4438.
[00:40:09.909 --> 00:40:10.210]  888-803-4438.
[00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:15.494]  Give Debbie a call.
[00:40:15.594 --> 00:40:17.095]  Tell them it's an Alex Jones special.
[00:40:17.596 --> 00:40:18.917]  And you'll save a lot of money.
[00:40:19.037 --> 00:40:20.318]  And yes, it's made in America.
[00:40:20.638 --> 00:40:23.100]  Or go to Berkeywater.com and look at the different systems.
[00:40:23.521 --> 00:40:25.983]  Look at the different free gifts you get when you order one of the systems.
[00:40:27.247 --> 00:40:32.850]  And just in the comments section, tell them it's an Alex Jones special and what free gift you won at Berkeywater.com.
[00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:34.090]  Debbie, thanks for coming on.
[00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:40.533]  Thank you, and if my line is busy, please leave a good number that I can reach you during the day and I will get back with you.
[00:40:41.413 --> 00:40:42.173]  God bless you, Debbie.
[00:40:42.193 --> 00:40:42.594]  Take care.
[00:40:42.614 --> 00:40:43.414]  Bye-bye.
[00:40:43.994 --> 00:40:51.277]  Folks, I mean, most Americans, number one, you're supposed to drink, I forget, what is it, eight, ten ounce glasses of water a day?
[00:40:51.297 --> 00:40:53.458]  I know that and I don't do it.
[00:40:54.065 --> 00:40:55.346]  When I do, I feel a lot better.
[00:40:55.366 --> 00:40:59.669]  A lot of times when I feel tired or have a headache, I can drink a couple big glasses of water, I feel better.
[00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:02.712]  It's really simple stuff like that.
[00:41:03.993 --> 00:41:05.634]  I know that cell phones are bad for me.
[00:41:06.354 --> 00:41:09.797]  But I still don't use the wireless hands-free satellite.
[00:41:10.297 --> 00:41:10.838]  I need to.
[00:41:11.398 --> 00:41:14.240]  There's hundreds of studies about how bad cell phone radiation is.
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:20.405]  You know, there's so many things we know are really bad for us, but we still do it.
[00:41:20.865 --> 00:41:22.667]  And it's part of a process for all of us.
[00:41:23.931 --> 00:41:27.433]  But you talk about the dangers of drugs, what about just chemicals, period?
[00:41:28.134 --> 00:41:30.495]  And here to discuss that with us is Dr. Breeding.
[00:41:30.535 --> 00:41:36.659]  He's an incredible author and researcher and just a good egg all around.
[00:41:37.279 --> 00:41:41.042]  And he valiantly has fought all across the country at legislatures.
[00:41:41.902 --> 00:41:44.064]  Hey Alex, thanks for supporting us with this effort.
[00:42:05.565 --> 00:42:26.719]  We are under siege all around the country and in Texas specifically with this new freedom initiative to take it to another level as if 10 million school-aged children in this country on psych drugs is not enough we now have this so-called new freedom initiative which of course really means new intrusion initiative to give supposed access
[00:42:28.553 --> 00:42:53.705]  To children who need help, which really means recruiting children to be labeled and drugged, so it's definitely an Orwellian thing and it's definitely something that everybody needs to be really aware that is happening right now and we need everybody's help in terms of convincing some of these legislators to reject these principles.
[00:42:54.341 --> 00:43:02.471]  Well, this is something that's wildly unpopular across the political spectrum, but Republicans and Democrats together continue to vote for it.
[00:43:02.491 --> 00:43:11.982]  But before we get into how they passed New Freedom last year, what it does, now we're fighting it at the state level, and they're being very open about it, before we do that, I want to talk about
[00:43:12.822 --> 00:43:27.330]  This latest mass shooting, ten people dead, he was the tenth person, this teenager, in every case, Dr. Breeding, I mean I haven't seen cases where they're not, I predicted it wasn't a hard prediction, he was on Prozac.
[00:43:28.571 --> 00:43:41.758]  Yeah, yeah, we've learned, just as you have Alex, over the years, that whenever you see one of these so-called senseless violence accidents, one of these school shootings, or going postal, or any of these kind of apparently
[00:43:42.879 --> 00:43:44.340]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:44:10.036 --> 00:44:15.779]  We know that strongly enough that we get the data usually within a couple of days, whereas before it would come out months later.
[00:44:15.799 --> 00:44:26.484]  And so yeah, you look at this guy Weiss, or Weiss, however you pronounce his name, and see that in the paper, and then you say, okay, well, when are we going to get the data?
[00:44:26.924 --> 00:44:35.148]  And then just a day or two later we find out, yeah, okay, he's been involved in psychiatry, he's been involved in treatment, and specifically he's been on Prozac.
[00:44:35.809 --> 00:44:38.370]  And we know that this class of drugs,
[00:44:39.028 --> 00:44:40.890]  I don't know.
[00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:46.035]  I think young people in general are more vulnerable because they don't metabolize the drug.
[00:44:58.948 --> 00:45:05.270]  As well as older people, but the same trend really is there in older people as well.
[00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:09.091]  Yeah, the mothers killing their children, cutting their arms off, drowning them, shooting them.
[00:45:09.111 --> 00:45:13.212]  Yeah, Andrea Yates, the big case in Houston a couple years ago, drowned her children.
[00:45:13.232 --> 00:45:14.632]  She was on two of these drugs.
[00:45:16.233 --> 00:45:21.694]  The original case, the Westbecker case, the guy who went so-called go postal and shot all those people.
[00:45:22.441 --> 00:45:27.243]  So you see, you know, the famous, what was his name, Hartman, the Good Morning America guy.
[00:45:28.783 --> 00:45:29.343]  His wife.
[00:45:29.764 --> 00:45:30.044]  Yeah.
[00:45:30.504 --> 00:45:39.127]  So you see this same dynamic with adults, but it's gotten more attention with the young people because of the school shootings and all that, where we've seen this recurrent pattern.
[00:45:39.307 --> 00:45:47.470]  Now I want to briefly talk about why, because I talked about this earlier just from what I've read and what other doctors have said here on air, Dr. Breeding, but isn't it really that it
[00:45:48.667 --> 00:45:53.452]  Well, that's the result.
[00:45:53.492 --> 00:46:01.341]  Here's the basic physiology, as I understand it.
[00:46:01.421 --> 00:46:11.271]  One is that the basic effects profile of this class of drugs, these serotonin drugs, is basically an amphetamine effect profile.
[00:46:12.083 --> 00:46:12.904]  I think so.
[00:46:29.088 --> 00:46:53.449]  And then, you know, you keep that going a little bit and pretty soon you get either a deficiency condition where somebody really reacts or you just get a toxic reaction with a certain percentage of people and you get a sleep deprivation cycle and then you get this so-called REM sleep, this rapid eye movement sleep kind of disruption and people get psychotic in the sense that they start to confuse
[00:46:56.205 --> 00:47:04.970]  And everybody knows that speed heads, I mean this happens in the military, they keep guys up for a week on drugs, suddenly the platoon starts killing each other.
[00:47:05.691 --> 00:47:07.592]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:47:08.132 --> 00:47:16.677]  So you get these reactions that have to do with the derangement of the system and the derangement of the regular forces that regulate consciousness.
[00:47:17.378 --> 00:47:22.441]  And a certain percentage of people, just for various reasons, it affects them severely.
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:34.423]  There's also another term that we use called akathisia which refers to a state of kind of real intense agitation and restlessness and you can't stand being inside your skin.
[00:47:35.463 --> 00:47:45.806]  And usually when we see these suicidal or homicidal kind of actions, it's precipitated by this kind of toxic central nervous system kind of state reaction.
[00:47:47.365 --> 00:47:53.771]  And that's where you see the incidences of suicide as well, like with my friend Glenn McIntosh here in town and his daughter.
[00:47:55.109 --> 00:47:57.029]  Now, I've looked at all those studies.
[00:47:57.049 --> 00:47:59.850]  We've had you and others on to talk about it, but it's not our opinion.
[00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:01.371]  It's the truth, but correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:48:01.911 --> 00:48:04.111]  They try to claim, well, the drugs aren't causing it.
[00:48:04.131 --> 00:48:05.672]  These are people who already have problems.
[00:48:06.052 --> 00:48:07.132]  But then they've done studies.
[00:48:07.192 --> 00:48:14.794]  No, you take people with problems, you put them on serotonin-type drugs, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, they get worse.
[00:48:14.834 --> 00:48:17.414]  You put them on a sugar pill, they get better.
[00:48:18.295 --> 00:48:23.716]  So how is that... I mean, the media's been really good at trying to spin that.
[00:48:24.444 --> 00:48:38.814]  Well, the argument is always that, you know, no, it's not the drug, it's the so-called disease, the so-called illness, you know, it's their clinical depression or whatever, you know, or their schizophrenia or whatever.
[00:48:40.175 --> 00:48:42.957]  But you got it, you know, there's some real basic problems with that.
[00:48:43.117 --> 00:48:48.561]  One is there's no evidence that there's any kind of real disease anyway going on biologically or genetically.
[00:48:48.581 --> 00:48:50.062]  And then secondly,
[00:48:51.073 --> 00:48:58.237]  It's not just the quote anecdotal evidence, meaning this pattern of killings that we're talking about and suicides that we're talking about.
[00:48:58.277 --> 00:49:11.686]  It's also in the actual clinical and research trials that a higher percentage of people who get the drugs go into suicidal or aggressive responses than people who don't get the drugs.
[00:49:12.884 --> 00:49:32.502]  You know the research data supports it that there's a certain percentage of people who have these reactions as well as the actual experiential kind of stuff of people out there that we see this going on that leads us to whenever you see a school shooting like this or whatever the first question to ask nowadays is always well what drugs are they on?
[00:49:36.509 --> 00:49:47.112]  I mean, I'm hard-pressed to find cases where they're not on these drugs.
[00:49:47.932 --> 00:49:56.154]  Shifting gears back to the New Freedom Initiative, if we've got already such a large portion of our children on these drugs, and a huge percentage of adults on them,
[00:49:57.623 --> 00:50:04.168]  I guess we're only going to see an increased rise in violence as they put more children on drugs.
[00:50:04.608 --> 00:50:07.791]  We're about to break, but in a nutshell, what is the New Freedom Initiative?
[00:50:08.051 --> 00:50:09.873]  Then we'll come back and talk about how they're implementing it.
[00:50:11.634 --> 00:50:15.437]  The President's commission called the New Freedom Commission on Mental Health
[00:50:16.693 --> 00:50:22.878]  Came out somewhere before last with their recommendations for the mental health system in this country.
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:31.846]  The pharmaceutical industry played a major role in the development of those recommendations.
[00:50:32.526 --> 00:50:37.370]  They cover every spectrum of society, including the schools.
[00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:39.192]  And we'll give you the details after the break.
[00:50:39.592 --> 00:50:40.913]  Yeah, we'll be right back, folks.
[00:50:41.053 --> 00:50:43.676]  And listen, where I live, in Texas,
[00:50:44.605 --> 00:50:46.647]  Everything we've talked about all these years is happening.
[00:50:47.327 --> 00:50:49.368]  Toll roads to be on all the major streets.
[00:50:50.289 --> 00:50:52.431]  Forced psychological testing and rugging.
[00:50:52.811 --> 00:50:54.112]  It's coming to your state too.
[00:50:54.212 --> 00:50:55.853]  I mean, I'm living it.
[00:50:55.873 --> 00:50:58.515]  What are you going to do when they come knocking on your door?
[00:51:01.579 --> 00:51:05.926]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.106 --> 00:51:10.553]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.693 --> 00:51:15.060]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:16.442]  The New World Order.
[00:51:17.203 --> 00:51:18.183]  Panama.
[00:51:18.243 --> 00:51:22.444]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.504 --> 00:51:29.446]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.566 --> 00:51:31.646]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.947 --> 00:51:42.249]  Homeland security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.

[00:54:06.731 --> 00:54:07.852]  Alright folks, welcome back!
[00:54:09.469 --> 00:54:12.611]  Piece by piece, brick by brick, they're building the prison around us.
[00:54:13.311 --> 00:54:14.692]  All we have to do is say no.
[00:54:14.732 --> 00:54:20.215]  I mean, as free human beings, we have a right to not be forced into psychological testing and drugging.
[00:54:21.135 --> 00:54:27.659]  But the state is claiming they have the right to do this to us, despite the fact that it's not just unconstitutional, but wildly unpopular.
[00:54:28.359 --> 00:54:33.202]  In major polls, 90 plus percent of Americans are against this new freedom initiative.
[00:54:34.492 --> 00:54:37.515]  But still, Republicans and Democrats passed it overwhelmingly.
[00:54:38.056 --> 00:54:40.378]  Now we see it being implemented at the state level.
[00:54:40.859 --> 00:54:51.450]  And Dr. Breeding, that now brings us to Texas, where they're being quite honest about the new bill they've introduced to conform to federal standards to get that money.
[00:54:53.169 --> 00:54:59.534]  Yeah, it's actually even more of a funnel of salt than I thought it was when we talked a couple of days ago.
[00:55:00.234 --> 00:55:04.677]  There is a bill that we were testifying on specifically that I want to tell you about.
[00:55:05.118 --> 00:55:11.642]  There's actually three bills now that all are involved in implementing new freedom recommendations here in Texas.
[00:55:12.943 --> 00:55:19.408]  But the one that I was involved in on Thursday was with Representative Davis who's out of the Houston area.
[00:55:20.231 --> 00:55:29.213]  And he was very up front in introducing the bill, which was ostensibly to kind of restructure the mental health system here in Texas.
[00:55:30.033 --> 00:55:39.376]  But he was very up front that his main goal was to follow the guidelines of the New Freedom Recommendations and to implement those in Texas.
[00:55:39.896 --> 00:55:48.598]  And it's House Bill 470, and it has three parts that are very specific that we're very
[00:55:49.953 --> 00:55:50.694]  We're good to go.
[00:56:11.412 --> 00:56:26.458]  So basically any other law that's relevant to civil rights or informed consent or whatever is gone by the wayside this prevails over any other law and that would include for example the laws that we managed to pass in 2003 in Texas which says that
[00:56:27.153 --> 00:56:41.875]  Schools cannot recommend and suggest drugs to parents, and schools cannot require that children take drugs as a condition of attending school, and parents cannot be threatened with accusations of medical neglect if they don't like the idea of drugging their kids.
[00:56:42.856 --> 00:56:46.396]  So this bill, first of all, overrides any other law.
[00:56:47.596 --> 00:56:56.538]  Secondly, it says that we want to make early mental health screening and referral a common practice.
[00:57:00.402 --> 00:57:23.074]  And the third part is that it wants to make sure that there's behavioral health authorities that are interfaced with the structure of the schools to screen every child to make sure in effect it's going to be that each school district has mental health clinics in the schools that screen and evaluate every child.
[00:57:23.584 --> 00:57:29.066]  Which is estimated that at least 20% of those kids would then be referred for further evaluation and treatment.
[00:57:29.847 --> 00:57:33.648]  Which basically means, in this climate, psych drugs.
[00:57:34.068 --> 00:57:43.953]  So instead of the estimated now, it's maybe between 10-15% maybe of the kids already on psych drugs, they want to basically double that.
[00:57:44.933 --> 00:57:49.755]  So that you're looking at, you know, 1 out of 4, 1 out of 3 kids on psych drugs.
[00:57:50.135 --> 00:57:51.116]  And that's House Bill 470.
[00:57:52.483 --> 00:58:03.794]  Representative Davis, his number is at the Capitol, it's Area Code 512, 4630734.
[00:58:04.475 --> 00:58:03.794]  4630734.
[00:58:04.976 --> 00:58:12.243]  That's Representative Davis in the Houston area, especially if he's a constituent, but anybody to call his office and say, we want
[00:58:13.072 --> 00:58:16.194]  The new Freedom Commission recommendation stripped out of that bill.
[00:58:16.334 --> 00:58:19.075]  We do not want mental health screening in the schools for our children.
[00:58:19.255 --> 00:58:22.777]  I bet a million bucks he gets lots of money from the drug companies.
[00:58:23.757 --> 00:58:26.118]  And then the other is Senator Jane Nelson.
[00:58:26.278 --> 00:58:26.919]  We got a break.
[00:58:26.959 --> 00:58:27.859]  Stay right there.
[00:58:27.979 --> 00:58:30.340]  We'll come back and get those numbers out again in the next hour.
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:35.503]  We're going to have Dr. Breeding for another 30 minutes with us and we're going to have a 9-11 rescue hero on with us.
[00:58:36.443 --> 00:58:41.626]  Talk about September 11th, continue with the Terry Schindler case and a lot more.
[00:58:42.717 --> 00:58:44.999]  We'll be right back with the second hour.
[00:58:45.539 --> 00:58:46.680]  Don't forget my website.
[00:58:46.721 --> 00:58:47.621]  It's PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:47.661 --> 00:58:48.302]  Hello, folks!
[00:58:48.922 --> 00:58:49.443]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.455 --> 00:59:00.535]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.235 --> 00:59:02.316]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.996 --> 00:59:03.856]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.556 --> 00:59:05.436]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.456 --> 00:59:09.757]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.298 --> 00:59:14.479]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.719 --> 00:59:17.139]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:20.660]  We're now into the second hour.
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:23.841]  It is Thursday, the 24th, the day of March 2005.
[00:59:24.361 --> 00:59:28.782]  Dr. John Breeding joins us to talk about the new Freedom Initiative.
[00:59:30.464 --> 00:59:34.247]  Did you ever think you'd hear terms like Homeland Security?
[00:59:34.927 --> 00:59:37.149]  New Freedom Initiative?
[00:59:37.809 --> 00:59:39.190]  Citizens Corps?
[00:59:41.092 --> 00:59:42.273]  Just all of this.
[00:59:42.393 --> 00:59:46.716]  I mean, this is classic, good old-fashioned tyranny.
[00:59:47.436 --> 00:59:49.758]  Whether you want to call it communist, fascist, whatever.
[00:59:49.798 --> 00:59:59.425]  Down to the black uniforms and the black helmets and the black armored vehicles and now with the high-tech overlay of the cameras and the surveillance blimps and
[01:00:00.402 --> 01:00:01.162]  It's sad!
[01:00:02.143 --> 01:00:11.228]  Meanwhile, Vicente Fox wants Americans arrested, and Bush says it's bad that they're going to be on their own property in lawn chairs with binoculars, showing all the illegal aliens pouring across.
[01:00:11.268 --> 01:00:11.808]  That's bad!
[01:00:12.448 --> 01:00:17.711]  We've got to give up all our rights to stop the terrorists, but we've got less border patrol than ever.
[01:00:18.852 --> 01:00:19.472]  It's amazing!
[01:00:19.912 --> 01:00:28.397]  And so now, right here in Texas, they're now passing the state laws to mesh with the federal law to start the forced psychological testing, and then
[01:00:30.123 --> 01:00:31.763]  Forced drugging of the population.
[01:00:32.303 --> 01:00:38.465]  Dr. Breeding brought up an interesting point about this particular bill, 470, here in the state of Texas.
[01:00:39.005 --> 01:00:42.766]  And you can bet your bottom dollar this stuff's going on in your state too right now, folks.
[01:00:44.546 --> 01:00:47.647]  Interesting that it says, oh, this law is above all previous laws.
[01:00:47.667 --> 01:00:49.367]  Because there's laws saying you've got rights.
[01:00:49.807 --> 01:00:52.228]  Laws that you can't be forcibly psychologically tested.
[01:00:52.608 --> 01:00:54.128]  Laws that you have due process.
[01:00:54.588 --> 01:00:57.329]  Laws that the schools can't force children on drugs.
[01:00:58.641 --> 01:01:05.065]  That we've gotten past in this state and others, and so they're not just trying to do the new freedom, they're trying to remove everything we've gotten past.
[01:01:06.066 --> 01:01:10.889]  Dr. Breeding, please continue with your analysis.
[01:01:11.830 --> 01:01:18.454]  Yeah, it's really scary in that sense, exactly what you just said about this prevailing over every other law.
[01:01:18.935 --> 01:01:19.535]  It really is.
[01:01:19.915 --> 01:01:25.059]  You know, one of the things that you're really good about, and the one thing that I really emphasize to people too, is that if you don't
[01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:36.123]  Really get on the language dynamic you really miss because the rhetoric and the language is really beguiling and sounds pretty good and so you don't understand that new freedom equals new intrusion.
[01:01:36.783 --> 01:01:40.324]  When they use the word access in this system they really mean recruitment.
[01:01:40.564 --> 01:01:43.165]  When they use the word integration they really mean coercion.
[01:01:43.705 --> 01:01:50.767]  When they integrate systems that means they're going to have child protective services interfaced with the schools, interfaced with the mental health system.
[01:01:51.337 --> 01:01:55.759]  And so that means integrated, but what it really means is that you tend to resist it.
[01:01:56.199 --> 01:02:02.161]  You've got somebody else coming in to coerce you, and if you don't understand the language of that, you're just going to be very confused.
[01:02:02.281 --> 01:02:08.563]  But this is Brave New World, I mean, where they have police that come to your house because you're not taking the drugs you're supposed to.
[01:02:08.583 --> 01:02:10.064]  That's right.
[01:02:10.504 --> 01:02:12.525]  And so, let me just go over this real quick.
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:22.103]  Listeners, you know, you're part of Alex Jones Radio Network, you're part of this movement, you know, and you do a lot of different actions and a lot of different things, and I appreciate that.
[01:02:22.724 --> 01:02:28.406]  And this is a specific action that I am asking of you and that Alex is asking and supporting.
[01:02:29.366 --> 01:02:31.187]  And, you know, so please do this.
[01:02:31.247 --> 01:02:36.269]  Please take a pen, write down this information, and make at least one phone call.
[01:02:37.169 --> 01:02:40.170]  If you've got ten minutes, you can make two or three phone calls.
[01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:42.211]  And I want to give you the names of these legislators.
[01:02:43.844 --> 01:02:44.644]  John Davis.
[01:02:45.224 --> 01:02:46.305]  He's from the Houston area.
[01:02:46.425 --> 01:02:51.826]  Again, it's 512-463-0734 is the number at the Capitol.
[01:02:51.886 --> 01:02:54.067]  If you're in the Houston area, you can find his local number.
[01:02:54.087 --> 01:02:54.067]  4630734.
[01:02:54.687 --> 01:02:58.708]  That's House Bill 470 that I just described.
[01:02:59.728 --> 01:03:03.189]  Senator Jane Nelson, who's up from the Dallas Flower Mound area.
[01:03:03.209 --> 01:03:03.249]  512-463-0112.
[01:03:03.269 --> 01:03:03.249]  4630112.
[01:03:03.289 --> 01:03:06.190]  That's the companion bill, Senate Bill 194.
[01:03:14.053 --> 01:03:15.634]  And I'm just going to go ahead and give you one more.
[01:03:15.674 --> 01:03:16.855]  It's Elliot Shapley.
[01:03:17.816 --> 01:03:22.160]  Those of you out in the El Paso area.
[01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:22.160]  4630129.
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:26.703]  4630129.
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:26.703]  All of those are Area Code 512.
[01:03:27.104 --> 01:03:29.145]  That's Senate Bill 1703.
[01:03:29.706 --> 01:03:38.433]  And then this one is a training bill to train teachers and educators into psychiatric recruiters and to establish... Now I gotta... I gotta hear this.
[01:03:40.143 --> 01:03:44.767]  Folks, we're getting to now see the actual nuts and bolts, how they're going to implement it in your area.
[01:03:45.448 --> 01:03:49.411]  We're on the front lines here in Texas, from toll roads to forced drugging.
[01:03:50.092 --> 01:03:50.832]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:50.852 --> 01:03:51.233]  Stay with us.
[01:03:53.695 --> 01:03:55.216]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:55.376 --> 01:03:58.478]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:58.598 --> 01:04:02.501]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:02.541 --> 01:04:06.784]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:04:07.144 --> 01:04:10.907]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:11.047 --> 01:04:12.868]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:13.448 --> 01:04:16.371]  Riot police attack people on the streets indiscriminately.
[01:04:16.411 --> 01:04:21.096]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:21.276 --> 01:04:24.319]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:24.499 --> 01:04:27.342]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:27.843 --> 01:04:33.969]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:34.489 --> 01:04:38.270]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:40.051]  Order your video today.
[01:04:40.431 --> 01:04:41.431]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.

[01:05:16.483 --> 01:05:20.565]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled,
[01:05:20.785 --> 01:05:22.928]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:05:23.088 --> 01:05:24.971]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:05:25.171 --> 01:05:31.179]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[01:05:31.439 --> 01:05:37.107]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[01:05:42.094 --> 01:05:42.795]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:57.151]  My doctor was truly amazed at the improvements my heart showed after my heart attack.
[01:05:57.431 --> 01:05:58.612]  Thank you, Cardivite.
[01:05:58.652 --> 01:06:03.673]  I was having a hard time breathing and had to rest in the afternoons, but since Cardivite, that's all changed now.
[01:06:03.713 --> 01:06:07.254]  I've had chronic fatigue for 12 years now and decided to try Cardivite.
[01:06:07.334 --> 01:06:09.275]  Boy, it's improved my energy dramatically.
[01:06:09.295 --> 01:06:09.815]  Cardivite.
[01:06:09.875 --> 01:06:10.335]  Cardivite.
[01:06:10.395 --> 01:06:11.896]  We all use Cardivite!
[01:06:12.794 --> 01:06:16.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, Heart Drop 2000 presents Cardivite.

[01:06:58.099 --> 01:06:58.739]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.399 --> 01:07:00.480]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:02.281]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.941 --> 01:07:03.782]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.502 --> 01:07:05.383]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.403 --> 01:07:09.725]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.245 --> 01:07:14.367]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:15.628 --> 01:07:19.210]  Alright, second segment for the second hour, 8 minutes and 30 seconds in.
[01:07:19.850 --> 01:07:21.992]  Thank you for joining us, coming up in about 25 minutes.
[01:07:23.519 --> 01:07:27.923]  We're going to be talking to one of the valiant rescue workers at the World Trade Center.
[01:07:28.383 --> 01:07:30.064]  Disaster there day one.
[01:07:30.745 --> 01:07:36.089]  And what he's going to reveal is very important on multiple fronts.
[01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:38.271]  So definitely stay with us for that.
[01:07:38.291 --> 01:07:40.293]  We're talking to Dr. John Breeding.
[01:07:40.933 --> 01:07:42.594]  And we'll give you his website here in a few minutes.
[01:07:43.015 --> 01:07:44.756]  New Freedom is now here in Texas.
[01:07:44.796 --> 01:07:45.837]  It's all over the country.
[01:07:46.157 --> 01:07:47.038]  The feds passed it.
[01:07:47.158 --> 01:07:51.842]  Forced psychological testing of every school-aged child up to 18 in the country.
[01:07:52.583 --> 01:07:56.146]  Home school, private school, they're talking about forcibly coming and making you do this.
[01:07:56.726 --> 01:08:08.836]  Here in the state of Texas, there's three different bills that in some respects even go past what was in the federal New Freedom Initiative that Ron Paul described as a brave new world.
[01:08:09.537 --> 01:08:11.418]  And let's be perfectly clear about this.
[01:08:11.778 --> 01:08:12.019]  St.
[01:08:12.119 --> 01:08:19.385]  John's ward has been found to be, in major studies, three times better at quote, getting people to not be depressed.
[01:08:19.445 --> 01:08:20.606]  And I'm not saying St.
[01:08:20.646 --> 01:08:21.106]  John's ward.
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:34.006]  In double-blind studies, there's a whole bunch of them, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the Prozac class of drugs, actually causes more problems, it's worse for people who are depressed, than sugar pill.
[01:08:35.026 --> 01:08:38.948]  It just doesn't have no effect, it actually hurts people.
[01:08:39.608 --> 01:08:45.111]  And then, of course, the latest mass shooter, and I said this days ago, I said, you watch, he's going to be on psychotropics.
[01:08:45.651 --> 01:08:48.332]  Folks, they're always, seriously, they're always on.
[01:08:48.352 --> 01:08:50.253]  I mean, it's a sure bet.
[01:08:53.177 --> 01:08:57.100]  I mean, every time I say they're going to be on it, I think, you know, hopefully this time they won't, but no, he was!
[01:08:57.340 --> 01:09:03.005]  And then, of course, the argument is, well, that's because he was already mentally ill, and this was helping him.
[01:09:03.045 --> 01:09:03.225]  No.
[01:09:03.725 --> 01:09:08.669]  The statistics in their own studies, when they approve these drugs, show that it actually increases it.
[01:09:08.929 --> 01:09:17.196]  That is, you take a pool of people who say they're angry, or they're depressed, or they're delusional, whatever the diagnosis is, you put them on these, they get worse.
[01:09:17.216 --> 01:09:19.578]  You go, well then, how could they be pushing it so much?
[01:09:20.094 --> 01:09:25.939]  Because the drug companies pay off the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association.
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:28.421]  They go out and they push all this.
[01:09:30.363 --> 01:09:32.965]  And then the doctors just believe whatever they're told, whatever they're taught.
[01:09:33.506 --> 01:09:34.967]  And so they go along with it.
[01:09:36.388 --> 01:09:47.878]  Folks, they fly doctors on junkets to five-star hotels for seven days, first-class plane tickets, cruises, everything.
[01:09:49.051 --> 01:09:49.672]  That is a fair analysis.
[01:09:49.692 --> 01:09:50.532]  The New Freedom Commission
[01:10:13.803 --> 01:10:14.243]  We're good to go!
[01:10:35.885 --> 01:10:36.665]  Thank you for having me.
[01:10:55.835 --> 01:10:58.877]  Dr. Breeding, I call these serial pieces of legislation.
[01:10:58.937 --> 01:11:00.138]  I guarantee it, folks.
[01:11:00.698 --> 01:11:06.341]  If you look at these three bills in Texas, you look at the Illinois bills, you look at other states, they're almost identical.
[01:11:06.381 --> 01:11:08.402]  In fact, I've cross-referenced a few of them.
[01:11:08.743 --> 01:11:16.367]  Well, they're very identical because they're specifically designed from the blueprint that was provided from the New Freedom Commission.
[01:11:17.347 --> 01:11:18.868]  So let's be clear for people.
[01:11:19.269 --> 01:11:26.033]  If you live in Missouri, or you live in New York, or you live in Florida, you live in California, you live in Colorado, you're listening.
[01:11:26.653 --> 01:11:30.716]  Chances are this is in your legislature right now, so pay attention.
[01:11:31.116 --> 01:11:32.757]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[01:11:32.877 --> 01:11:34.398]  We have one of the bills posted.
[01:11:34.758 --> 01:11:37.000]  Dr. Breeding, do you have all three posted on your website?
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:41.522]  I don't have the bills posted on my website right now, but I will.
[01:11:41.602 --> 01:11:45.265]  But you can contact my website, WildestCoats.com.
[01:11:47.299 --> 01:11:53.142]  And also the ablechild.org website and connect and we can give you the information that you need.
[01:11:53.282 --> 01:11:55.363]  Okay, I want to go to some calls here in a few minutes.
[01:11:55.383 --> 01:11:56.003]  800-259-9231.
[01:11:57.804 --> 01:11:59.464]  Open the phones up for the first time.
[01:11:59.905 --> 01:12:02.226]  Just for Dr. Breeding on this subject right now, folks.
[01:12:02.246 --> 01:12:02.706]  800-259-9231.
[01:12:02.726 --> 01:12:06.768]  We'll go to Kim here in just a second.
[01:12:06.788 --> 01:12:09.829]  But Dr. Breeding, I want to go back to what you talked about in the last segment.
[01:12:10.289 --> 01:12:16.032]  I want to give those phone numbers out one more time, but before we do that, you got short-changed by the break coming up that we slammed into.
[01:12:16.612 --> 01:12:23.656]  Specifically, that third piece of legislation to teach the teachers how to be their own little shrinks.
[01:12:24.216 --> 01:12:26.277]  Yeah, let me give the numbers again first.
[01:12:26.897 --> 01:12:34.021]  House Bill 470, Representative John Davis, all these are Area Code 512 for the Austin Capital.
[01:12:34.462 --> 01:12:42.187]  4-6-3-0-7-3-4 4-6-3-0-7-3-4 House Bill 470 John Davis Senate Bill 194 Senator Jane Nelson 4-6-3-0-1-1-2 and the last one Senate Bill 17-0-3 that's Elliot Shepley from the El Paso area 4-6-3-0-1-2-9 that's the one that basically turns
[01:13:02.856 --> 01:13:03.156]  Thank you.
[01:13:20.439 --> 01:13:21.019]  Mental illness.
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:24.641]  And I've seen these sheets, Dr. Breeding, it's... Are you upset?
[01:13:24.681 --> 01:13:26.022]  Mental illness in quotes, folks.
[01:13:26.062 --> 01:13:27.863]  There is no mental illness going on.
[01:13:27.923 --> 01:13:36.407]  There's only people's judgments about behavior and putting labels on children in order to qualify them for a market of psychiatric drugs.
[01:13:36.567 --> 01:13:39.088]  Well, I've seen these sheets.
[01:13:39.448 --> 01:13:40.229]  Are you upset?
[01:13:40.349 --> 01:13:41.129]  Are you anxious?
[01:13:41.189 --> 01:13:42.790]  Well, what 12-year-old isn't?
[01:13:43.724 --> 01:13:44.485]  Are you upset?
[01:13:44.585 --> 01:13:45.485]  Are you anxious?
[01:13:45.525 --> 01:13:46.846]  Have you had a bad day?
[01:13:46.926 --> 01:13:48.066]  Are you eating regularly?
[01:13:48.106 --> 01:13:49.547]  Did you have any trouble sleeping?
[01:13:49.607 --> 01:13:51.348]  Are your mommy and daddy having problems?
[01:13:51.948 --> 01:13:54.190]  You know, all these kind of questions, you know.
[01:13:54.230 --> 01:13:56.831]  Yeah, now we've got to put them on drugs because they're at risk.
[01:13:57.291 --> 01:14:01.413]  Because they're at risk, or because they, uh, whatever, you know.
[01:14:01.674 --> 01:14:06.716]  And what happens is, and this happened to the Gleason family right here outside of Austin.
[01:14:07.336 --> 01:14:09.257]  They're doing this teen screen already.
[01:14:09.358 --> 01:14:10.538]  We've had the doctor on, yeah.
[01:14:10.798 --> 01:14:11.999]  They screen the child.
[01:14:13.471 --> 01:14:15.712]  She, somebody decides she's depressed.
[01:14:16.672 --> 01:14:19.593]  The family doesn't hop on Friday when they say hop on Friday.
[01:14:19.613 --> 01:14:24.294]  And so on Monday, they yank the child out, put her in the state hospital, put her in the treatment center.
[01:14:25.034 --> 01:14:27.515]  She ends up on 14 different psychiatric drugs.
[01:14:27.595 --> 01:14:31.536]  It takes nine months for the family, with the help of a good lawyer, to get the daughter back.
[01:14:31.616 --> 01:14:36.317]  Within a couple of months after that, we've got her off the drugs and she's doing fine because she never needed them in the first place.
[01:14:36.817 --> 01:14:40.398]  But it's a classic example of what can happen when the state
[01:14:40.896 --> 01:14:41.176]  No, we're good.
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:12.282]  Ritalin or Prozac.
[01:15:12.322 --> 01:15:14.964]  I got two more points I want to cover with you then we gotta go to calls.
[01:15:15.184 --> 01:15:16.365]  Go for it.
[01:15:16.885 --> 01:15:18.066]  But two more points here.
[01:15:18.807 --> 01:15:26.633]  WOAI a few months ago did that report where they admitted over two-thirds of Texas foster children are on an average of four drugs.
[01:15:27.053 --> 01:15:28.894]  Some are on as many as 17.
[01:15:29.275 --> 01:15:31.837]  They then start having seizures they're on so many drugs.
[01:15:32.337 --> 01:15:35.880]  And even doctors were on record saying, look I saw this child.
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:37.061]  The child was happy and healthy.
[01:15:37.361 --> 01:15:38.202]  They put them on drugs.
[01:15:38.262 --> 01:15:39.723]  Now they're literally vegetables.
[01:15:40.503 --> 01:15:44.167]  This shows what the government with a captive audience wants to do.
[01:15:44.987 --> 01:15:46.949]  And you look at Massachusetts over two-thirds.
[01:15:47.290 --> 01:15:49.011]  On average the states are over two-thirds.
[01:15:49.532 --> 01:15:51.053]  I'm just talking about Texas.
[01:15:51.593 --> 01:15:53.775]  I mean, they know what they're doing.
[01:15:54.536 --> 01:15:56.037]  This is so maniacal.
[01:15:56.077 --> 01:15:58.500]  I mean, again, it's like something out of a horror movie.
[01:15:58.540 --> 01:15:59.801]  Number one, I want you to comment on that.
[01:15:59.861 --> 01:16:05.426]  And number two, why do the site drug divisions of these companies
[01:16:06.064 --> 01:16:07.866]  Okay, well the first point is, you're right, it's just
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:17:01.577]  I mean this whole thing is institutionalized child abuse that we've got putting all these kids on these drugs and it's especially dramatized and severe in the so-called foster care system once the child is in the arms of the state and what's important to realize is that when your child is in a government school that teachers and mental health people and everybody else in the schools first and foremost they're a government agent and if you trust government agents most of your listeners don't by this point but that's just fundamental to realize you know
[01:17:02.239 --> 01:17:04.261]  These people are government agents, you know.
[01:17:04.681 --> 01:17:09.605]  And in the foster care system, they're just put on drug after drug after drug.
[01:17:09.705 --> 01:17:10.987]  It is just horrific.
[01:17:11.207 --> 01:17:12.088]  And it's very real.
[01:17:12.148 --> 01:17:15.050]  And we've got legislation going on that, too.
[01:17:15.410 --> 01:17:22.897]  Well, the feds pass these laws and tell the schools, you've got to put X number of kids on drugs or you don't get your funds.
[01:17:23.678 --> 01:17:26.000]  I mean, they've passed tons of these laws.
[01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:29.803]  They're out there bounty hunting, just like cops writing tickets.
[01:17:30.478 --> 01:17:31.479]  I mean, they've got a quota!
[01:17:31.979 --> 01:17:38.666]  Well, the schools have become arm and arm with psychiatry and the whole sort of therapeutic state mentality.
[01:17:38.766 --> 01:17:40.047]  This is the last question!
[01:17:40.247 --> 01:17:45.472]  And the second question is, well, first of all, you know, the controls on the regular medical drugs
[01:17:46.354 --> 01:17:46.634]  I don't know.
[01:18:06.641 --> 01:18:08.562]  People are able to get elected at a political level.
[01:18:08.622 --> 01:18:11.845]  That's basically where their loyalties are, is towards corporate immunity.
[01:18:12.285 --> 01:18:18.169]  And the pharmaceutical industry just happens to be probably the most profitable industry in the world and they run those dynamics.
[01:18:18.569 --> 01:18:33.620]  And there's a whole smokescreen around it in the sense that psychiatry managed to establish itself via incredible propaganda and advertising monies for the public to kind of get this idea that it's actually a legitimate branch of medicine as opposed to a pseudo-scientific
[01:18:34.355 --> 01:18:35.356]  I don't know.
[01:18:54.881 --> 01:19:00.405]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[01:19:00.565 --> 01:19:01.626]  You wear deodorant, right?
[01:19:01.746 --> 01:19:02.627]  Well, let's hope you do.
[01:19:02.727 --> 01:19:05.569]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[01:19:05.769 --> 01:19:10.673]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[01:19:10.853 --> 01:19:11.994]  Check out this new product.
[01:19:12.134 --> 01:19:13.254]  It's called No B.O.

[01:19:15.396 --> 01:19:17.497]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No B.O.
[01:19:17.517 --> 01:19:19.119]  to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[01:19:19.259 --> 01:19:19.419]  Look.

[01:20:06.996 --> 01:20:21.564]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[01:22:21.997 --> 01:22:23.137]  Sugarbalance.org.
[01:22:23.677 --> 01:22:24.097]  The U.S.
[01:22:24.317 --> 01:22:30.079]  9th District Court ruled that Food Matrix is better for maintaining vibrant health than our present inorganic vitamin and mineral supplements.
[01:22:30.419 --> 01:22:36.061]  The Nobel Prize winning science of Food Matrix has created an organic formula providing you the vital nutrients you need.

[01:22:41.403 --> 01:22:42.343]  We've got to move fast here.
[01:22:42.363 --> 01:22:43.984]  We've got another important guest coming on.
[01:22:44.004 --> 01:22:45.664]  It's always great to have Dr. Breeding with us.
[01:22:45.684 --> 01:22:47.545]  You're going to have new freedom in Texas.
[01:22:47.565 --> 01:22:49.425]  They're going to be at your door.
[01:23:11.050 --> 01:23:12.330]  Jenny says she's depressed.
[01:23:12.591 --> 01:23:14.091]  She will go on the new drug.
[01:23:14.531 --> 01:23:15.031]  Oh no!
[01:23:15.051 --> 01:23:16.372]  Oh, we're going to arrest you then!
[01:23:16.432 --> 01:23:17.132]  Ha ha ha!
[01:23:18.232 --> 01:23:19.493]  Folks, this is serious.
[01:23:20.273 --> 01:23:21.814]  Kim in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:23:21.894 --> 01:23:22.394]  Go ahead.
[01:23:24.875 --> 01:23:25.955]  Kim literally just hung up.
[01:23:27.796 --> 01:23:28.896]  Right as I went to her.
[01:23:28.976 --> 01:23:30.377]  Callers, you're very good at that.
[01:23:31.517 --> 01:23:32.097]  That's alright.
[01:23:32.117 --> 01:23:34.358]  Dan, Dan, where are you calling from?
[01:23:34.578 --> 01:23:36.098]  Well, we're calling from Minnesota here.
[01:23:36.479 --> 01:23:36.979]  Welcome, sir.
[01:23:36.999 --> 01:23:37.599]  What's on your mind?
[01:23:38.559 --> 01:23:46.741]  Uh, I wanted to ask your guest, uh, basically he's making the issue here about this drugs, uh, is this only in Texas that you're talking about this?
[01:23:47.041 --> 01:23:47.461]  No, sir.
[01:23:47.581 --> 01:23:54.163]  New Freedom was federally passed, despite the fact that in polls, 90% of Americans were against it.
[01:23:54.643 --> 01:23:59.904]  Now the states have to change their laws for forced psychological testing and drugging.
[01:24:00.364 --> 01:24:05.946]  Because we've gotten laws passed against it, even going back to the old days of eugenics.
[01:24:07.432 --> 01:24:17.898]  Psychiatry got so out of control, sir, I have actual photos of them taking an ice pick and hammering it into somebody's skull into their brains and laughing while they do it.
[01:24:17.958 --> 01:24:21.220]  I mean, that's how lobotomies were done.
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:23.262]  I mean, these people are out of control.
[01:24:23.722 --> 01:24:32.127]  We already have existing laws to try to block them and, you know, more of their one who flies over the cuckoo's nest type travesties.
[01:24:32.507 --> 01:24:33.608]  Dr. Breeding comments.
[01:24:34.719 --> 01:24:36.380]  Minnesota's definitely involved.
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:50.104]  There's also a woman in Minnesota, Dr. Karen Ephraim, with the Ed Action, the website's edaction.org, that's really leading the charge in challenging the new Freedom Commission.
[01:24:50.184 --> 01:24:53.825]  I'd encourage you to connect with her up there, Karen Ephraim.
[01:24:54.318 --> 01:24:57.760]  But there's legislative stuff going on in Minnesota, I know for sure.
[01:24:57.780 --> 01:25:05.545]  I know one of them and this one ADD kid that I know, it was so disruptive they had to get him out of the school.
[01:25:06.642 --> 01:25:12.348]  And what I'm saying is evidently these kids are so screwed up that they gotta put them on some kind of drug just to calm them down.
[01:25:13.209 --> 01:25:14.450]  That's your assumption, you know.
[01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:18.634]  I mean, people get kicked out of schools and jobs for a lot of different reasons, you know.
[01:25:18.654 --> 01:25:24.960]  But to say that you have to put somebody on a drug to calm them down... Hold on, we got both people talking.
[01:25:26.421 --> 01:25:28.143]  Well, ADD is a belief system.
[01:25:28.183 --> 01:25:29.124]  There is no real ADD.
[01:25:29.204 --> 01:25:30.725]  It's just somebody's opinion.
[01:25:31.005 --> 01:25:31.966]  Well, it's not my opinion.
[01:25:32.026 --> 01:25:32.827]  I knew this, Ed.
[01:25:32.887 --> 01:25:33.908]  He was definitely ADD.
[01:25:33.928 --> 01:25:35.710]  No, you knew that he was disruptive.
[01:25:35.730 --> 01:25:37.211]  Hey, you know, everybody stop right there.
[01:25:37.571 --> 01:25:40.294]  Dr. Breeding and Dan, stop right there.
[01:25:40.594 --> 01:25:48.661]  Dan, they give us over a hundred new medical terms, medical conditions that aren't medical conditions.
[01:25:49.102 --> 01:25:50.423]  Have children been brats?
[01:25:50.963 --> 01:25:53.964]  Have children been drinking three Coca-Colas and bouncing off the walls?
[01:25:54.284 --> 01:25:58.445]  Have children not had men at home and turned into little brats and need to be disciplined?
[01:25:58.885 --> 01:25:59.265]  Yes.
[01:25:59.605 --> 01:26:08.627]  Do you need to put them on methamphetamine that shrinks their brain and expands their heart and makes them have heart attacks and screws them up worse, statistically?
[01:26:08.927 --> 01:26:15.408]  What Dr. Breeding is telling you is ADD, top scientists, medical doctors, have said it is a fraud.
[01:26:15.908 --> 01:26:17.970]  All I can tell you is I did know this kid.
[01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:19.771]  He's about 22 years old now.
[01:26:19.791 --> 01:26:21.393]  They had to get him out of school.
[01:26:21.933 --> 01:26:23.495]  The kid was ADD plus.
[01:26:23.515 --> 01:26:24.235]  He was indigo.
[01:26:24.776 --> 01:26:26.177]  He was labeled ADD.
[01:26:26.237 --> 01:26:29.059]  And I bet you money while you saw him... Hold on a second, Doctor.
[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:34.084]  I bet you money that while you saw him bouncing off the walls, that he was on Redlin.
[01:26:34.584 --> 01:26:40.369]  The kid was so dysfunctional that even a live-in boyfriend couldn't even stand him because this kid was evidently...
[01:26:40.836 --> 01:26:41.697]  You're not listening to me.
[01:26:41.717 --> 01:26:45.419]  Hey, we've given our country over to these psychologists and psychiatrists.
[01:26:45.659 --> 01:26:46.660]  Look what they've done to it.
[01:26:47.301 --> 01:26:48.702]  I mean, what are you saying, sir?
[01:26:48.742 --> 01:26:52.925]  You don't... I'm asking you, was he on Ritalin at the time he was bouncing off the walls?
[01:26:53.305 --> 01:26:57.428]  No, they tried to put him on something, but he refused to and they kicked him out of the school.
[01:26:58.067 --> 01:26:59.048]  Oh, okay.
[01:26:59.068 --> 01:27:01.629]  Do you have children?
[01:27:01.949 --> 01:27:02.469]  Let me stop you.
[01:27:02.589 --> 01:27:03.210]  Do you have children?
[01:27:03.610 --> 01:27:04.550]  No, I don't have any children.
[01:27:04.570 --> 01:27:09.393]  Well, if you did, don't worry, you'll get to see the secret police squads out putting us all on the drugs.
[01:27:09.633 --> 01:27:10.973]  There were no secret police.
[01:27:11.014 --> 01:27:12.174]  This kid was simply on drugs.
[01:27:12.194 --> 01:27:12.874]  You're not listening.
[01:27:13.495 --> 01:27:15.236]  You keep using this one example.
[01:27:15.656 --> 01:27:18.117]  I'm asking, you called in about New Freedom Initiative.
[01:27:18.357 --> 01:27:21.399]  Are you for forced psychological testing of every child in America?
[01:27:21.819 --> 01:27:21.999]  Yes.
[01:27:22.802 --> 01:27:23.162]  You are?
[01:27:23.542 --> 01:27:26.163]  Yeah, because these kids are so dysfunctional.
[01:27:26.183 --> 01:27:28.124]  You've got methamphetamine out in the suburbs.
[01:27:28.845 --> 01:27:29.485]  That's it.
[01:27:30.245 --> 01:27:31.306]  I can't listen to it anymore.
[01:27:31.426 --> 01:27:32.066]  Thanks for the call.
[01:27:32.226 --> 01:27:33.146]  I mean, it's just mindless.
[01:27:34.027 --> 01:27:37.828]  We've got methamphetamine and they're so dysfunctional, so let's put them on methamphetamine.
[01:27:38.349 --> 01:27:38.929]  Dr. Breeding?
[01:27:39.969 --> 01:27:47.933]  Yeah, I mean, people who truly believe, and it's the same thing as what you present about Ashcroft and all these ideas.
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:56.149]  That you take away your liberty in order to get some sort of alleged security or insecurity or whatever.
[01:27:56.169 --> 01:27:58.893]  He has an opinion about ADHD.
[01:28:00.822 --> 01:28:08.884]  That there's no scientific evidence that there is anything like that in the sense that this child has any biological or genetic defect that's causing his behavior.
[01:28:08.904 --> 01:28:10.144]  It's like the Loch Ness Monster!
[01:28:10.164 --> 01:28:11.165]  It's just his opinion!
[01:28:11.325 --> 01:28:12.625]  It's like the Loch Ness Monster!
[01:28:13.025 --> 01:28:15.626]  People have behavior problems for a lot of different reasons.
[01:28:15.666 --> 01:28:17.806]  People don't like school for a lot of different reasons.
[01:28:18.206 --> 01:28:21.007]  We don't know the unique dynamics of this situation.
[01:28:21.047 --> 01:28:22.807]  We're not saying that people don't have problems.
[01:28:23.248 --> 01:28:29.229]  We're just saying that that doesn't mean they have a biologically based mental illness and that the drugs
[01:28:29.778 --> 01:28:31.660]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:32.700]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:56.204 --> 01:29:01.690]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:06.354]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:29:06.595 --> 01:29:13.602]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:14.002 --> 01:29:20.083]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:20.243 --> 01:29:21.484]  There are no side effects.
[01:29:21.804 --> 01:29:24.744]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:29:24.904 --> 01:29:26.865]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:29:27.245 --> 01:29:34.466]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:29:34.766 --> 01:29:38.147]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[01:30:53.308 --> 01:30:55.650]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:59.752]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:31:00.072 --> 01:31:00.893]  Read the labels.
[01:31:01.313 --> 01:31:05.436]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:31:05.656 --> 01:31:09.859]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:31:10.239 --> 01:31:15.102]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.

[01:31:44.415 --> 01:31:46.196]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:31:46.276 --> 01:31:46.776]  until 2 p.m.
[01:31:46.836 --> 01:31:56.800]  Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight Central, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:32:08.044 --> 01:32:22.771]  And we're going to be talking to Sergeant Matthew Tartaglia, who was a valiant Ground Zero hero, won several awards from the governor, you name it, was there day one, didn't wear a breathing mask because they had to be able to communicate.
[01:32:23.411 --> 01:32:29.254]  We're not just going to talk about the asbestos and how many people are dying and the rescue dogs dying and how they're not being given treatment.
[01:32:29.654 --> 01:32:34.157]  We're going to talk about some of the things he saw, the discrepancies in the official 9-11 story.
[01:32:36.556 --> 01:32:51.164]  But I appreciate him holding because, you know, if Dan in Minnesota, who thinks we should forcibly, psychologically test every child in America, wants to call back in the last 30 minutes of this broadcast next hour, I will debate you.
[01:32:52.144 --> 01:33:02.529]  If I cut you off it's because I'm frustrated, I've got loaded phones here for Dr. Breeding, and you're just babbling mindlessly, and it makes me really sick.
[01:33:03.070 --> 01:33:05.431]  I mean, number one,
[01:33:06.582 --> 01:33:14.107]  With the Texas foster children, and this is the national average, but this is in the news in Texas, over two-thirds are on psychotropic drugs.
[01:33:15.168 --> 01:33:16.729]  The average child's on four.
[01:33:17.429 --> 01:33:24.254]  Some are on upwards of 17 until they have strokes, until they go into seizures.
[01:33:24.334 --> 01:33:25.475]  I mean, it's sick!
[01:33:27.096 --> 01:33:33.140]  I've got articles out of the New York Post and New York Daily News where they're testing pesticides on foster children.
[01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:34.681]  Yes, the government
[01:33:35.259 --> 01:33:42.626]  Four private corporations gives them, gives them pesticide drinks, and then the children go into bed and go into comas, some die.
[01:33:42.646 --> 01:33:43.967]  I mean, that's, that's BBC.
[01:33:44.968 --> 01:33:47.050]  I bet you think giving them pesticides good?
[01:33:47.491 --> 01:33:49.833]  Do you understand this government's evil?
[01:33:50.974 --> 01:33:52.776]  Can you get it through your brain?
[01:33:53.196 --> 01:33:54.698]  Project Shad, 1985.
[01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:58.862]  Spraying our troops with nerve gas and killing them.
[01:33:59.997 --> 01:34:02.859]  1968, releasing biologicals in the New York subway.
[01:34:03.380 --> 01:34:05.581]  Deaths resulted, details remain classified.
[01:34:05.761 --> 01:34:08.463]  They'll kill Americans just to see what it does!
[01:34:10.545 --> 01:34:12.626]  That's the nut cases run in this country!
[01:34:15.788 --> 01:34:26.276]  And, no, it's not freedom, it's not new freedom to have the government forcibly, psychologically test every child when the drug companies wrote the... Do you understand they put the kid up there
[01:34:27.091 --> 01:34:30.274]  In Minnesota, who just shot all those people, he was on Prozac!
[01:34:30.294 --> 01:34:31.175]  They're always on it!
[01:34:31.355 --> 01:34:35.259]  Their own studies, their own internal trials, so it makes them violent killers!
[01:34:37.201 --> 01:34:41.845]  And then your comeback is, this kid you knew was on methamphetamine, so he needed to be on Ritalin?
[01:34:42.246 --> 01:34:43.107]  It's the same thing!
[01:34:43.707 --> 01:34:47.331]  Your argument is just... You know what, I bet you money you're on drugs.
[01:34:48.194 --> 01:34:49.595]  You're on probably two or three of them.
[01:34:50.056 --> 01:34:54.319]  I bet when they put you on the first one, Dan, I bet when they put you on the first one, you got worse.
[01:34:54.559 --> 01:34:55.660]  So now you're on two or three.
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:57.041]  Maybe you're on four!
[01:34:58.042 --> 01:35:02.466]  And you can't admit that you've got problems and that you need to fix them.
[01:35:02.506 --> 01:35:03.987]  Instead, you're going to keep taking drugs.
[01:35:04.628 --> 01:35:06.650]  The effects profile of methamphetamine
[01:35:22.828 --> 01:35:25.289]  It's a total irresponsibility thing.
[01:35:25.309 --> 01:35:27.749]  ADHD doesn't cause anything because it doesn't exist.
[01:35:27.789 --> 01:35:29.729]  It's just a label that's put onto something.
[01:35:29.749 --> 01:35:31.370]  Young people have problems.
[01:35:52.601 --> 01:35:58.186]  That guy in Minnesota, no telling, you know, but the Prozac just made it worse and he turned into a killer.
[01:35:58.226 --> 01:35:59.307]  Everything you said, Alex.
[01:36:00.628 --> 01:36:02.829]  I'll just ditto that and let's hear from your caller.
[01:36:04.130 --> 01:36:06.632]  Alright, now, Kim in Texas, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:36:07.113 --> 01:36:10.796]  Hey Alex, I'm trying to calm down from that last phone call it got me going to.
[01:36:11.816 --> 01:36:16.020]  But I wanted to just touch base on a drug that my daughter was on.
[01:36:17.029 --> 01:36:23.610]  And how she got put on that drug so that people can understand how wide the scope is of all this medication.
[01:36:24.091 --> 01:36:30.752]  Not just limited to, you know, Prozac and those drugs that, you know, Ritalin that you guys were talking about.
[01:36:30.772 --> 01:36:36.173]  She was on an anti-seizure drug called Tegretol from the time she was two until she was eight.
[01:36:36.453 --> 01:36:40.754]  And when we took her off the drug about a year and a half ago, she started having emotional problems.
[01:36:41.474 --> 01:36:44.115]  She would literally flail and act like a two-year-old
[01:36:44.827 --> 01:36:45.787]  to deal with her emotions.
[01:36:45.807 --> 01:36:49.028]  She just did not know how to deal with her emotions.
[01:36:49.749 --> 01:36:54.270]  And I found out that they also use that drug for aggressive and impulsive behavior.
[01:36:54.290 --> 01:36:57.971]  So basically she was sedated for six years.
[01:36:59.111 --> 01:37:06.754]  And if she had to have psychological testing right now, then they'd just throw her on something else.
[01:37:06.834 --> 01:37:09.255]  Number one, children have problems.
[01:37:09.335 --> 01:37:10.315]  It's part of life.
[01:37:10.934 --> 01:37:12.114]  It's part of your development.
[01:37:12.134 --> 01:37:18.016]  Some of the most powerful, intelligent, dynamic, creative people I know were misfits.
[01:37:19.357 --> 01:37:21.237]  I mean, it just... You know what?
[01:37:21.397 --> 01:37:22.478]  I have the government documents.
[01:37:22.518 --> 01:37:24.258]  They are targeting our best and brightest.
[01:37:24.698 --> 01:37:27.539]  They do not want the people that stick their heads up above the crowd.
[01:37:27.900 --> 01:37:28.500]  Dr. Breeding?
[01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:31.501]  Toddlers have tantrums.
[01:37:32.161 --> 01:37:38.623]  Adolescents get confused and they don't think very well and get passionate and get despairing about life.
[01:37:39.108 --> 01:37:39.768]  And you're right.
[01:37:39.929 --> 01:37:41.549]  Those are called problems in living.
[01:37:41.589 --> 01:37:45.792]  That's called natural challenges of development, which is hard and challenging and risky.
[01:37:46.292 --> 01:37:47.693]  They are not pathologies.
[01:37:47.733 --> 01:37:49.173]  They are not mental illnesses.
[01:37:49.734 --> 01:37:54.056]  Life is not a cakewalk into town, especially in today's world.
[01:37:54.516 --> 01:37:57.278]  It only makes things worse to pathologize and label.
[01:37:57.658 --> 01:38:01.840]  Tegretol, the anticonvulsants, are used in the same stew as these other psych drugs.
[01:38:02.543 --> 01:38:04.124]  You've got the dynamic exactly.
[01:38:04.365 --> 01:38:09.489]  One, it suppresses her emotional and characterological development so she's back to age two.
[01:38:10.150 --> 01:38:16.896]  Plus, she's going through drug withdrawal, which would typically be interpreted as, oh, that's evident that she still needs the drug.
[01:38:17.583 --> 01:38:23.204]  And it's very good that you're getting her off that, that you're protecting her from the insidious forces in the meantime.
[01:38:23.564 --> 01:38:27.625]  And you'll have your child back in a while, and it's a beautiful thing.
[01:38:27.805 --> 01:38:34.167]  Well, and I wanted to let people out there know, too, people are probably thinking, well, she had seizures, so she needed to be on something.
[01:38:34.207 --> 01:38:45.750]  But the thing was, she was seizure-free for four years, and the only neurologists here in town are all in the same group that's connected to Children's Hospital, where she was having her EECs done.
[01:38:48.578 --> 01:39:00.947]  Part of growing up is becoming disillusioned with the idea that you can trust authority.
[01:39:01.327 --> 01:39:07.172]  There's no doubt about it and it's definitely true in the medical profession as well as these other areas that Alex talks about.
[01:39:09.153 --> 01:39:15.398]  It's a sad thing and the really sad thing is a lot of people wake up to that only after they've had their child hurt.
[01:39:15.939 --> 01:39:19.760]  Your child, fortunately, was not killed, was not permanently altered.
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:24.342]  I've sat with too many parents whose child died and that's what woke them up.
[01:39:25.002 --> 01:39:28.023]  It's a hard way to wake up.
[01:39:28.103 --> 01:39:29.683]  Kim, thanks for the call.
[01:39:30.223 --> 01:39:31.024]  One last call.
[01:39:32.604 --> 01:39:34.465]  Is it James or Jamie in North Carolina?
[01:39:34.805 --> 01:39:35.665]  Hi, it's James.
[01:39:35.925 --> 01:39:36.825]  Okay, James, go ahead.
[01:39:37.006 --> 01:39:38.186]  Okay, real quick.
[01:39:39.216 --> 01:39:45.399]  I've fought this mess since I was in 1975 and they put me on all kinds of stuff.
[01:39:45.679 --> 01:39:47.080]  I'm disabled now.
[01:39:47.100 --> 01:39:55.384]  I used to drive trucks, but to get to the point, all these drugs, I was a hyperactive kid, but most kids were.
[01:39:55.884 --> 01:40:02.407]  Most kids nowadays are locked up in the house, they're scared to go out because somebody's after them or things like that.
[01:40:02.827 --> 01:40:07.209]  And I wanted to ask your guests, I'm on Paxil right now and Klonopin,
[01:40:07.970 --> 01:40:16.676]  And I'm a diabetic too, and I get this just ominous doomsday feeling all the time now.
[01:40:17.236 --> 01:40:20.098]  And the doctor wants to switch me over somewhere else.
[01:40:20.278 --> 01:40:24.281]  So what I want to do is just get off all this crap and start over.
[01:40:24.361 --> 01:40:25.541]  What's his response?
[01:40:25.962 --> 01:40:30.545]  Well, the response is that you're on one of the most addictive drugs in the world, which is Paxil.
[01:40:30.945 --> 01:40:35.548]  So getting off it needs to be very gradual.
[01:40:36.109 --> 01:40:43.554]  You know, I recommend the website drugawareness.org and Anne Tracy's videotape on withdrawing from psychiatric drugs.
[01:40:44.114 --> 01:40:47.677]  I've also got an article on my website on there, but that's what I recommend.
[01:40:47.757 --> 01:40:55.482]  And then you talk to your doctor and you gradually withdraw, like 10% of the time, and know that you're going through a withdrawal process.
[01:40:55.782 --> 01:40:57.303]  You can do it, but it's very difficult.
[01:40:57.443 --> 01:41:01.746]  Yeah, if I have to take... And the drugs will contribute to a diabetic problem.
[01:41:02.619 --> 01:41:05.723]  That can be one of the overall long-term effects of the drugs.
[01:41:05.803 --> 01:41:09.467]  I was going to say that, but that's what I've read, is that it can cause diabetes.
[01:41:09.707 --> 01:41:10.848]  Listen, thanks for the call, James.
[01:41:11.389 --> 01:41:18.417]  I carry both of Dr. Breeding's books on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, or you can call toll-free and get them Wildest Cults.
[01:41:19.017 --> 01:41:25.959]  I'll make the best horses and it goes through all this and you can call toll free 1-888-253-3139 to get it.
[01:41:25.979 --> 01:41:27.479]  888-253-3139 or Infowars.com.
[01:41:27.499 --> 01:41:29.180]  Dr. Breeding, thanks for coming on.
[01:41:29.220 --> 01:41:34.461]  Yeah, and call somebody at the Texas Capitol, maybe Senator Jane Nelson, 512-463-0112.
[01:41:34.481 --> 01:41:37.382]  Tell her you do not want mental health screening in the schools.
[01:41:48.089 --> 01:41:48.809]  Thanks a lot.
[01:41:49.109 --> 01:41:50.390]  Thanks, Alex, for having me on, man.
[01:41:50.410 --> 01:41:52.310]  All right, thank you, Dr. Breeding, for coming on.
[01:41:52.850 --> 01:42:00.052]  And he's been down there fighting it, and this is happening in your state right now, too, the federal implementation of forced psychological testing.
[01:42:00.793 --> 01:42:02.553]  And in Illinois, it's already going to be for the adults.
[01:42:02.573 --> 01:42:04.434]  All right, I apologize to our next guest.
[01:42:05.254 --> 01:42:10.255]  He's Sergeant Matthew Tartaglia, and the U.S.
[01:42:10.535 --> 01:42:16.677]  Search and Rescue Task Force, U.S.S.A., RTF.ORG, Critical Incident
[01:42:17.549 --> 01:42:25.951]  Stress Management Counselor and Debriefer at Ground Zero and did not wear a mask at site because he had to talk.
[01:42:26.391 --> 01:42:29.632]  Now he has been super sick for three years.
[01:42:29.712 --> 01:42:32.073]  Respiratory problems, teeth falling out, etc.
[01:42:33.013 --> 01:42:36.874]  And a lot of his friends who were there have gotten sick as well or died.
[01:42:36.894 --> 01:42:42.956]  And we have all the major new scientist reports, you name it, about the asbestos, the lung scans, all of it.
[01:42:43.876 --> 01:42:46.717]  Bush blocked the 90 plus million in funding
[01:42:47.921 --> 01:42:50.103]  For these men and women that were out there at the site.
[01:42:50.123 --> 01:42:51.804]  The police, the firemen, the rescuers.
[01:42:52.564 --> 01:42:54.966]  But that's not the only reason he's coming on with us today.
[01:42:55.006 --> 01:42:58.247]  He noticed some other interesting things there at Ground Zero.
[01:42:58.868 --> 01:43:00.269]  Sergeant, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:43:00.649 --> 01:43:01.489]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:43:02.690 --> 01:43:03.531]  I'm doing okay.
[01:43:03.571 --> 01:43:07.333]  Despite all the horrible things that are going on, we're trying to expose it.
[01:43:07.693 --> 01:43:08.674]  I hear you.
[01:43:08.734 --> 01:43:10.795]  First of all, I want to say thank you for what you do.
[01:43:11.770 --> 01:43:14.152]  It's a hard line that you're towing.
[01:43:14.292 --> 01:43:19.195]  You are in line of fire, as we say in the field.
[01:43:19.235 --> 01:43:20.536]  You are on the front line.
[01:43:21.197 --> 01:43:24.359]  You are a forward observer and you are bringing back the intel.
[01:43:24.519 --> 01:43:25.940]  And you're standing up and saying it.
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:33.365]  And very few people are willing to, as they say, die on their feet as opposed to living on their knees.
[01:43:33.765 --> 01:43:39.029]  And with that, I just want to say to Dan, I hope you're not one of these government people
[01:43:39.747 --> 01:43:47.628]  Callin' the waste time of someone trying to disclose information because we're accustomed to what you're doing and, you know, we'll get around you.
[01:43:47.668 --> 01:43:49.009]  We will keep getting around you.
[01:43:50.369 --> 01:43:53.670]  Anyway, uh... Tell us a little bit about yourself, uh, Matthew.
[01:43:53.930 --> 01:43:56.850]  Alright, well, uh, I'm, uh, less than 40 years old.
[01:43:56.990 --> 01:43:58.450]  I'm just going on to 39.
[01:43:59.451 --> 01:44:05.652]  And, uh, I've been in public service, uh, emergency services for... since I've been 20 years old almost.
[01:44:05.872 --> 01:44:07.152]  Uh, just about, just about.
[01:44:07.944 --> 01:44:14.128]  I've worked, I was emancipated at age 14, so I saw the world from a different point of view, if you will.
[01:44:14.748 --> 01:44:34.641]  I didn't go to high school, I didn't have that luxury, and it turned out to be a blessing and a benefit to me because I didn't fall for the training, which I think it takes place in high school, to take the popular people, the rich people, and make them the prom king and queen, as what happens here in grand old America and some other places.
[01:44:36.430 --> 01:44:38.591]  I have always been outspoken.
[01:44:39.372 --> 01:44:42.654]  It's always gotten me into the hot seat, if you will.
[01:44:43.835 --> 01:44:49.079]  And sometimes, I'll tell you the truth, while I was sitting here waiting, I know what I'm going to be talking about.
[01:44:49.159 --> 01:44:53.482]  My heart's thundering in my chest because I'm angry.
[01:44:53.903 --> 01:44:54.503]  I'm hurt.
[01:44:54.823 --> 01:44:55.684]  I'm disappointed.
[01:44:56.304 --> 01:45:04.971]  And, of course, if I have a brain in my head, I'm a little nervous because, you know, King George got on and said,
[01:45:05.834 --> 01:45:11.180]  If you support the terrorist theories or the conspiracy theories, you're one of them.
[01:45:12.102 --> 01:45:13.824]  And you know what we do to them.
[01:45:13.844 --> 01:45:19.390]  Yeah, he said if you talk about outrageous conspiracy theories surrounding 9-11, you're with the terrorists.
[01:45:19.410 --> 01:45:19.791]  That's right.
[01:45:20.171 --> 01:45:21.513]  And you know what we do to them.
[01:45:21.533 --> 01:45:22.474]  That's their own words.
[01:45:23.787 --> 01:45:26.289]  We're going to expose the real terrorists.
[01:45:26.529 --> 01:45:29.451]  Now, you sent me a mountain of documents.
[01:45:29.992 --> 01:45:35.576]  The awards you got for being at Ground Zero, from the Governor, all of it, your whole history, Sterling Record.
[01:45:35.896 --> 01:45:43.122]  Describe what happened on 9-11, and let's go through the discrepancies of the official story, other rescue workers,
[01:45:43.682 --> 01:45:44.522]  Let's do it one at a time.
[01:45:44.562 --> 01:45:45.563]  Let's start with just post 9-11.
[01:46:09.739 --> 01:46:22.673]  Just like the students were pointing up in the sky and telling their teachers and their parents that those buildings weren't going to be there, I too and many other people on the internet knew that this date was a dangerous date because of certain things in the past.
[01:46:23.094 --> 01:46:27.999]  These world people love to do things in allegoric fashion.
[01:46:28.019 --> 01:46:30.622]  They love to do things right under your nose.
[01:46:31.258 --> 01:46:34.259]  And you talk about this in some of your films I've seen.
[01:46:34.519 --> 01:46:41.781]  And for those that just joined us, we have MSNBC, New York Daily News, students, all these people.
[01:46:41.801 --> 01:46:43.361]  So those won't be there next week.
[01:46:43.701 --> 01:46:47.302]  Odigo admits that they instant messaged their people to get out of the building.
[01:46:47.322 --> 01:46:48.542]  That's harrassment.
[01:46:48.582 --> 01:46:50.163]  So, number one, what you said is documented.
[01:46:50.423 --> 01:46:51.863]  Yes, it is absolutely documented.
[01:46:51.903 --> 01:46:58.845]  Not to mention the fact that anybody who is awake at all from the neck up will know that had people not been warned,
[01:46:59.955 --> 01:47:01.756]  30 plus thousand people would be dead today.
[01:47:02.697 --> 01:47:04.059]  They wanted more people dead.
[01:47:04.079 --> 01:47:04.940]  They're disappointed.
[01:47:05.020 --> 01:47:07.062]  Don't you think that for a second they're not disappointed?
[01:47:07.082 --> 01:47:12.087]  Yeah, normally, normally on a Tuesday morning what you would have had about 30,000 people they said.
[01:47:12.247 --> 01:47:12.628]  That's right.
[01:47:12.648 --> 01:47:13.148]  Or more.
[01:47:14.198 --> 01:47:14.758]  Four more.
[01:47:14.939 --> 01:47:22.524]  I've been in New York many, many times as a worker, as a visitor, and I have yet to see that not be the truth.
[01:47:22.544 --> 01:47:24.366]  So, already something's wrong.
[01:47:24.406 --> 01:47:31.271]  In addition to which, some of the guys who I spoke to there, they know the building was pulled just like 7 was pulled.
[01:47:32.292 --> 01:47:36.515]  I don't care how many planes you fly into those War Trade Centers.
[01:47:36.735 --> 01:47:42.940]  If the planes themselves took it down, they would have fallen sideways, not down in an implosion-type style.
[01:47:43.658 --> 01:47:52.181]  Not to mention the reports from talking to people as a counselor who told me things they didn't even realize they were saying.
[01:47:52.701 --> 01:47:54.741]  They were in such a state of shock.
[01:47:54.781 --> 01:48:05.425]  They just said, well, you know, I saw this, this, this, this, and this, and they're caught up in their trauma, and I'm listening to it and thinking to myself, my God, this is a conspiracy.
[01:48:05.445 --> 01:48:09.706]  This is a real Pearl Harbor modern day.
[01:48:11.334 --> 01:48:12.335]  Well, I want to go over that.
[01:48:13.416 --> 01:48:16.198]  So describe what you did when you first got to Ground Zero.
[01:48:16.258 --> 01:48:25.025]  The first thing that you notice is when you went on the first day there, if you went there out of turn, you were arrested for the most part.
[01:48:25.125 --> 01:48:29.828]  One of the men on our team was arrested for going what they call out of turn.
[01:48:30.689 --> 01:48:32.911]  If you were there, you were invited.
[01:48:33.817 --> 01:48:38.943]  If you worked in a sensitive area, you were an invited group.
[01:48:39.303 --> 01:48:40.324]  We were invited.
[01:48:40.444 --> 01:48:44.108]  We were told that we were to stand down until Friday.
[01:48:44.809 --> 01:48:50.455]  Well, myself and a couple of my teammates, well, we couldn't exactly take that because we were sick to our stomachs.
[01:48:50.475 --> 01:48:53.859]  We're rescue people and we know that every moment counts for rescue.
[01:48:54.875 --> 01:48:59.277]  By the time that Tuesday night had occurred, it was a recovery effort.
[01:48:59.337 --> 01:49:01.838]  Anybody who knows anything about rescue knows that's a fact.
[01:49:01.858 --> 01:49:03.978]  There's no way a human being could live through that.
[01:49:04.279 --> 01:49:04.539]  None.
[01:49:04.559 --> 01:49:06.860]  Fire engines were crushed in half, sir.
[01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:20.044]  But when we got there, we had to be very careful about our help, who we said we were, how we assisted for those first couple of hours, because you did run the risk of being arrested.
[01:49:20.865 --> 01:49:21.085]  Then,
[01:49:21.827 --> 01:49:31.919]  When you were allowed there, I recall being on the pile and working, and you could hear nothing but generators, Alex.
[01:49:31.979 --> 01:49:34.022]  There was nothing but generators and crying.
[01:49:34.943 --> 01:49:41.811]  No matter what they showed you on that television, it was nothing compared to when you turned a corner and you were in the thick of it.
[01:49:42.694 --> 01:49:50.820]  Well, I want to hear the details from an eyewitness who got some of the biggest rewards and citations on the rescue efforts.
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:51.480]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:51.500 --> 01:49:51.920]  Stay with us.
[01:49:53.982 --> 01:49:58.345]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.505 --> 01:50:02.868]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:05.282 --> 01:50:06.643]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:24.212 --> 01:50:34.794]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.954 --> 01:50:40.355]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:50:40.855 --> 01:50:44.055]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:50:44.095 --> 01:50:44.596]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:50:44.616 --> 01:50:45.896]  Order today and spread the word!
[01:50:55.095 --> 01:51:06.364]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[01:51:06.584 --> 01:51:10.067]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[01:51:10.247 --> 01:51:14.548]  It kills off cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:14.828 --> 01:51:18.769]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[01:51:18.989 --> 01:51:25.511]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.

[01:53:06.461 --> 01:53:10.962]  By the way, my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State, is out.
[01:53:13.183 --> 01:53:23.025]  I got hundreds of interviews at Ground Zero with people saying that they were particularly themselves told not to go into work, but then they'd say, but you can't put me on tape, I've been threatened.
[01:53:23.665 --> 01:53:27.266]  I did put a lot of people on the tape, though, who were told, or talked to others that were told,
[01:53:28.453 --> 01:53:36.757]  But MSNBC said they went out to quote disproven urban legend about warnings and found out it was true.
[01:53:37.817 --> 01:53:41.078]  We have that article in the film but you gotta get Marshall Law folks.
[01:53:41.118 --> 01:53:44.760]  I want you to get it, make copies, spread the word, expose the killers.
[01:53:45.738 --> 01:53:48.421]  Uh... the true culprits of September 11th.

[01:54:17.084 --> 01:54:17.925]  Other videos.
[01:54:18.365 --> 01:54:20.086]  It's ridiculous what you get for the price.
[01:54:20.686 --> 01:54:21.966]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:54:21.986 --> 01:54:22.947]  But the new film is out.
[01:54:23.207 --> 01:54:23.987]  It's my best work.
[01:54:24.007 --> 01:54:24.628]  I hope you'll get it.
[01:54:25.428 --> 01:54:31.091]  Going back to Sergeant Matthew... Sergeant...
[01:54:32.561 --> 01:54:35.423]  Again, you sent me so many documents, so much information.
[01:54:35.463 --> 01:54:38.004]  I mean, you were so highly decorative of the things you did there.
[01:54:38.565 --> 01:54:48.971]  We've talked to other rescue workers here on the broadcast in the past as well, and I've talked to firefighters who said they saw the bombs going off, and they'll tell me, Alex, I'm sorry, I've been threatened, I can't come on your show.
[01:54:49.911 --> 01:54:51.012]  We've been told to shut up.
[01:54:52.053 --> 01:55:00.838]  So many people, but again, you're going to be with us into the next hour, and then later we'll take calls, but there's so much to talk about that you witnessed,
[01:55:01.801 --> 01:55:06.624]  Uh, there's a whole facet of the toxic waste and how you guys weren't given treatment.
[01:55:06.885 --> 01:55:07.945]  Well, I have a little list here.
[01:55:07.985 --> 01:55:09.967]  I should be able to follow it and go, okay?
[01:55:09.987 --> 01:55:12.889]  Yeah, run down the list first, then we'll go through the list.
[01:55:13.009 --> 01:55:21.014]  Okay, uh, from what I sent you about the Red Cross and some of the systems out there to help you, that's basically fundamentally flawed.
[01:55:21.514 --> 01:55:23.996]  They will tell you what's wrong, but they will not help you.
[01:55:24.016 --> 01:55:28.239]  Uh, the only way they'll help you is if you start talking about conspiracies.
[01:55:28.299 --> 01:55:29.860]  Then they're all about helping you.
[01:55:31.211 --> 01:55:34.512]  Uh, there's no money for people who lost their jobs like I did.
[01:55:34.692 --> 01:55:36.472]  I was on call until the end.
[01:55:36.492 --> 01:55:37.413]  Well, that's what I'm saying.
[01:55:37.433 --> 01:55:39.673]  They're really a government agency there to pay people off.
[01:55:39.893 --> 01:55:40.513]  Oh, yes, they are.
[01:55:41.013 --> 01:55:41.694]  Or kill you.
[01:55:44.434 --> 01:55:48.715]  I work for American Power Corporation that, you know, oh, we'll keep your job open.
[01:55:49.255 --> 01:55:51.256]  It didn't happen to myself and another person.
[01:55:52.728 --> 01:56:07.417]  As we traveled back, one of the things that I noticed always is as we traveled from New York to Pennsylvania, the further we got from New York, the colder the climate became towards the workers at Ground Zero when we got to Pennsylvania.
[01:56:07.457 --> 01:56:13.181]  People were very distant from us, the workers from up there.
[01:56:14.341 --> 01:56:18.904]  As for the folks at the Port Authority, who I worked with hand-in-hand mostly,
[01:56:19.545 --> 01:56:23.708]  They lost more people, uh, proportionally than anyone did.
[01:56:24.528 --> 01:56:29.532]  And yet they were not allowed to be on the site for days.
[01:56:30.252 --> 01:56:45.562]  They actually came to our little pavilion at the Florida Authority headquarters and they said, look, if we don't get on that site today or tomorrow, we're going to sneak on there with FDNY clothes and we're going to shoot them MFers on where they stand.
[01:56:46.646 --> 01:56:56.314]  So, you know, it was a very hostile circumstance between the New York Fire Department and the Port Authority.
[01:56:56.354 --> 01:56:59.636]  Well, I know they even banned photography at the site.
[01:56:59.656 --> 01:57:02.579]  They would just tackle you and take your camera away.
[01:57:03.419 --> 01:57:05.981]  I saw people, I watched them be tackled.
[01:57:07.122 --> 01:57:10.285]  I've been officially pressed for a little while, but I've done some
[01:57:11.508 --> 01:57:14.509]  Press work, you know, where I've written a law article here, a law article there.
[01:57:14.870 --> 01:57:17.791]  And I have never, ever, ever seen anything like that.
[01:57:18.091 --> 01:57:20.352]  Well, then they hold the steel off to China.
[01:57:20.392 --> 01:57:21.432]  They got it brought up.
[01:57:21.452 --> 01:57:23.033]  Yeah, well, they did that for a reason.
[01:57:23.053 --> 01:57:23.873]  They did that for a reason.
[01:57:23.893 --> 01:57:26.974]  Well, let's go over what you witnessed, because there's so much.
[01:57:27.995 --> 01:57:29.515]  Let's talk about all of it when we get back.
[01:57:29.555 --> 01:57:31.016]  We're about to start the third hour.
[01:57:31.756 --> 01:57:33.357]  Then later we'll take calls as well at 800-259-9231.
[01:57:33.377 --> 01:57:35.217]  Don't forget the new film, Martial Law, is out.
[01:57:35.237 --> 01:57:35.818]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:50.106 --> 01:57:50.747]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.407 --> 01:57:52.488]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.189 --> 01:57:54.270]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.930 --> 01:57:55.791]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.511 --> 01:57:57.412]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.432 --> 01:58:01.736]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.256 --> 01:58:06.380]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:10.603]  Third hour, my friends, Thursday, 24th day of March, 05.
[01:58:11.424 --> 01:58:16.048]  We're talking to Sergeant Matthew Tartaglia, highly decorated rescue worker.
[01:58:17.457 --> 01:58:42.109]  and counselor as well and debriefer there at the World Trade Center disaster site and it's a laundry list of things that he's an eyewitness to and everything he's a witness to we've already confirmed with multiple other sources most of it even in the mainstream media but forgotten but it's good to have an eyewitness on to discuss this from the data recorders being found now the buildings were turned into dust
[01:58:43.059 --> 01:58:54.430]  Uh, to different elements of the government robbing and looting things out of the buildings, the ATMs, uh, to the rescue workers, firemen, police, Port Authority workers not getting
[01:58:55.831 --> 01:58:57.553]  Medical treatment for the asbestos.
[01:58:57.953 --> 01:58:58.914]  We're going to cover it all.
[01:58:59.534 --> 01:59:01.396]  Where should we start, Sergeant?
[01:59:01.656 --> 01:59:03.998]  I think we should just keep going from the beginning there.
[01:59:04.038 --> 01:59:08.342]  When we first got there, we were told where we could go and where we couldn't go.
[01:59:08.382 --> 01:59:11.124]  There were different places that you were not to go to.
[01:59:11.144 --> 01:59:17.149]  One of the things you were not to go to, and they claimed it was for safety, was down in the garages, the parking garages.
[01:59:18.410 --> 01:59:19.831]  Uh, they were very flooded.
[01:59:19.951 --> 01:59:21.291]  There was a lot of problems like that.
[01:59:21.571 --> 01:59:23.952]  All the apartments around there were all sealed off.
[01:59:23.992 --> 01:59:26.113]  A lot of things were very much sealed off.
[01:59:26.773 --> 01:59:33.355]  However, at the same time, right from the beginning, one of the things that I noticed is there was looting everywhere.
[01:59:33.993 --> 01:59:38.334]  People were stealing clothes that were meant for us, the rescue people.
[01:59:38.694 --> 01:59:43.756]  When our clothes got so contaminated, we were told not to bring our clothes off that site.
[01:59:44.236 --> 01:59:45.316]  Don't wear anything on the site.
[01:59:45.336 --> 01:59:47.677]  You're not prepared to leave there because it's contaminated.
[01:59:49.697 --> 01:59:58.440]  We went through an OSHA training on how to use our breeders, but I didn't wear a breeder and neither did any of my counselors because
[01:59:59.906 --> 02:00:05.188]  How can you talk through a muffled, you know, double-filtered respirator?
[02:00:05.268 --> 02:00:05.768]  You can't.
[02:00:10.969 --> 02:00:26.054]  The damage that you would see there, number one, I want to just move to one thing that's my pet peeve that drives me absolutely insane, if you don't mind for one second, and that is that they claim that they found these passports of the hijackers.
[02:00:26.855 --> 02:00:30.078]  There wasn't one piece of glass on the ground that was whole.
[02:00:30.939 --> 02:00:46.333]  I would like to know how it is possible that a plane that supposedly incinerated steel that's supposed to handle a four and five thousand degrees Fahrenheit burning for days on end, a passport that was on that plane survived in that kind of ball fire.
[02:00:46.353 --> 02:00:47.394]  I'd like to know how that happened.
[02:00:48.075 --> 02:00:54.056]  I'd like to know how all of the convenient things were found but nothing quote-unquote inconvenient was found.
[02:00:54.116 --> 02:01:02.438]  I'd like to know how is it possible they knew that a ring that was contaminated with all of this thing that they got the DNA off of it.
[02:01:02.538 --> 02:01:08.619]  Anybody who's ever followed DNA sampling knows that you need a pretty clean source of DNA to know who it is.
[02:01:09.460 --> 02:01:13.580]  When we found body parts it wasn't like something you see in some crazy horror film.
[02:01:13.861 --> 02:01:14.941]  It looked like a rat.
[02:01:15.021 --> 02:01:15.461]  It looked like a...
[02:01:17.041 --> 02:01:19.144]  Uh, it looks like something you never want to see in your life.
[02:01:20.245 --> 02:01:20.745]  Ever.
[02:01:20.805 --> 02:01:24.890]  I want to repeat all of this because yeah, they said they found a ring of one of the hijackers.
[02:01:25.090 --> 02:01:26.231]  That's right.
[02:01:26.271 --> 02:01:28.333]  They found not one, but two passports.
[02:01:28.373 --> 02:01:33.659]  Later it turns out that they were fakes and the government just dropped the story.
[02:01:34.358 --> 02:01:40.327]  But, you know, it's like that magic bullet that shot through two people in steel and wasn't even deformed that hit Kennedy.
[02:01:40.687 --> 02:01:41.528]  Right, yeah.
[02:01:41.548 --> 02:01:42.229]  That's a magic bullet.
[02:01:42.249 --> 02:01:43.090]  There's several of those.
[02:01:43.491 --> 02:01:46.916]  There's a couple people who have been shot by that same magic bullet manufacturer.
[02:01:48.126 --> 02:01:52.068]  For those that don't know, if you shoot a bullet into water, it deforms, folks.
[02:01:52.088 --> 02:01:52.648]  Exactly.
[02:01:52.728 --> 02:01:55.830]  You shoot a bone with a bullet, it blows into pieces.
[02:01:55.850 --> 02:01:57.591]  It breaks into fragments most of the time.
[02:01:57.611 --> 02:02:02.013]  Not that one that went through two people and four bones and metal.
[02:02:02.333 --> 02:02:03.354]  That's an amazing bullet.
[02:02:03.474 --> 02:02:04.895]  Well, it's just like this passport.
[02:02:04.975 --> 02:02:06.115]  It's made out of kryptonite.
[02:02:06.275 --> 02:02:06.796]  I guess so.
[02:02:07.096 --> 02:02:09.557]  It must be the most powerful substance on Earth.
[02:02:09.577 --> 02:02:11.078]  We should be looking at that, too.
[02:02:11.118 --> 02:02:13.339]  Maybe to protect our planes and our buildings, maybe.
[02:02:13.359 --> 02:02:15.460]  Or something we can paint the walls with that.
[02:02:16.579 --> 02:02:17.219]  Or wallpaper.
[02:02:17.259 --> 02:02:18.560]  The next time we won't have any problem.
[02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:20.480]  But one of the other problems... Well, Tim, we've got a break.
[02:02:20.520 --> 02:02:24.822]  Let's come back and go over the passport, over more of this, over the looting.
[02:02:24.862 --> 02:02:26.142]  I want details of the looting.
[02:02:26.162 --> 02:02:30.344]  And then I want to talk about how you've gotten sick and what's happened to members of your team.
[02:02:30.364 --> 02:02:30.904]  Okay.
[02:02:31.264 --> 02:02:32.604]  And take some phone calls.
[02:02:32.664 --> 02:02:34.245]  We'll be right back talking to an eyewitness.
[02:02:34.265 --> 02:02:35.105]  He was there, folks.
[02:02:35.805 --> 02:02:36.686]  Highly decorated.
[02:02:37.686 --> 02:02:38.706]  So, Matthew, stay with us.
[02:02:39.367 --> 02:02:40.987]  We shall return after this quick break.
[02:02:45.487 --> 02:02:52.354]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:02:52.654 --> 02:02:54.036]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:02:54.216 --> 02:02:56.438]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:02:56.578 --> 02:02:58.660]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:02:58.941 --> 02:03:03.886]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:03:04.206 --> 02:03:08.250]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:03:08.490 --> 02:03:10.270]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:03:10.330 --> 02:03:20.993]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.133 --> 02:03:23.033]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:03:23.233 --> 02:03:27.094]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns of the info war.

[02:05:46.773 --> 02:05:52.795]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.415 --> 02:05:56.376]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.494 --> 02:06:07.898]  Alright, we're talking to one of the rescue heroes, and he was highly decorated for the work he did in the weeks after 9-11.
[02:06:09.219 --> 02:06:14.502]  And, uh, just everything he's saying checks out with the publicly available information we have.
[02:06:15.583 --> 02:06:17.904]  Sergeant Matthew Cartaglia.
[02:06:18.825 --> 02:06:27.530]  And, uh, Sergeant, again, continuing with this, so you're there on Ground Zero, you're looking at this total devastation,
[02:06:28.300 --> 02:06:33.202]  And they're claiming that they found one of the hijackers' rings with some of his blood on it.
[02:06:33.642 --> 02:06:35.623]  They found two of the hijackers' passports.
[02:06:35.663 --> 02:06:36.903]  Later it turned out they were fake.
[02:06:37.304 --> 02:06:38.764]  The government had manufactured that.
[02:06:38.784 --> 02:06:44.506]  But we have a government, folks, that pays for hundreds of millions of dollars a year in fake newscasts.
[02:06:45.247 --> 02:06:45.587]  Okay?
[02:06:45.647 --> 02:06:47.968]  I mean, you know, that pay off the reporters.
[02:06:48.068 --> 02:06:50.169]  Well, they won an election that way, too.
[02:06:50.189 --> 02:06:50.989]  Let's not forget that.
[02:06:51.744 --> 02:06:53.546]  Well, this is what they do over and over again.
[02:06:53.666 --> 02:07:01.013]  So you're there, and then you described how day one they're not letting you guys get in to rescue people.
[02:07:01.313 --> 02:07:01.534]  Right.
[02:07:03.135 --> 02:07:08.280]  Alex, from that evening on, it was a recovery effort.
[02:07:08.881 --> 02:07:16.088]  They kept on telling people that it was a rescue effort, it's a rescue effort, it's a rescue effort, and that's about M-O-N-E-Y and nothing else.
[02:07:17.222 --> 02:07:18.224]  Money, money, money.
[02:07:18.284 --> 02:07:19.025]  Send us your money.
[02:07:19.085 --> 02:07:20.447]  We got things to take care of.
[02:07:20.487 --> 02:07:21.369]  We got people to food.
[02:07:21.409 --> 02:07:23.752]  There was food rotting on the dock.
[02:07:23.813 --> 02:07:24.974]  There was so much food there.
[02:07:25.395 --> 02:07:28.139]  There was... The only thing they did not turn away was money.
[02:07:29.557 --> 02:07:30.358]  There were bikes.
[02:07:30.698 --> 02:07:37.203]  Well, I remember when the Red Cross kept saying, give us blood, give us blood, because most people won't give blood, they'll give money.
[02:07:37.543 --> 02:07:38.864]  It's the psychology.
[02:07:39.044 --> 02:07:43.007]  And it's turned out that just thousands and thousands of gallons of blood was rotting.
[02:07:43.027 --> 02:07:44.689]  It was a big joke.
[02:07:44.849 --> 02:07:47.451]  And then, of course, I told people, I said, don't give your money to the Red Cross.
[02:07:47.811 --> 02:07:49.052]  They'll give it to gun control.
[02:07:49.092 --> 02:07:50.233]  They'll give it to other groups.
[02:07:50.313 --> 02:07:52.234]  And they kept half the money.
[02:07:52.895 --> 02:07:57.478]  And then I saw articles where they would only go offer families money to shut up.
[02:07:57.939 --> 02:07:59.320]  And then you just said that.
[02:07:59.850 --> 02:08:01.171]  To go away and shut up.
[02:08:01.671 --> 02:08:04.572]  If you want money, you need to be a pain in the pita.
[02:08:04.812 --> 02:08:05.692]  You know what I mean?
[02:08:06.352 --> 02:08:07.193]  Pain in the arse.
[02:08:07.633 --> 02:08:09.654]  And you need it to be it seriously.
[02:08:09.714 --> 02:08:11.394]  Because there's plenty of shut up money.
[02:08:11.774 --> 02:08:12.795]  But honorable money?
[02:08:12.855 --> 02:08:13.535]  There's none of that.
[02:08:15.056 --> 02:08:15.776]  I need some help?
[02:08:15.916 --> 02:08:16.636]  There's none of that.
[02:08:16.836 --> 02:08:17.937]  My teeth are falling out?
[02:08:17.977 --> 02:08:18.757]  There's none of that.
[02:08:19.918 --> 02:08:21.218]  I'd like to talk to somebody?
[02:08:21.638 --> 02:08:22.859]  That's what insurance is for.
[02:08:23.119 --> 02:08:28.361]  And when we were helping the emergency workers, you know, we were 12 hours on, 12 hours off.
[02:08:29.984 --> 02:08:40.092]  If you spoke to civilians, you actually were reprimanded by not being allowed to go back to the pile per hour, per occurrence.
[02:08:40.612 --> 02:08:53.742]  So if you talked to four people, they wouldn't say anything to you on the pile, but when you got back to come back, you know, and got ready at the Port Authority, got showered, dressed, and ready to return, they'd say, uh, hmm, Tartaglia, you have to hold up a second, we need to talk to you for a second.
[02:08:54.042 --> 02:08:57.485]  And then we would have nonsensical conversations for two or three hours.
[02:08:57.945 --> 02:09:01.467]  And then... So it was all run basically as an intelligence operation.
[02:09:01.487 --> 02:09:02.007]  Yes, right.
[02:09:02.648 --> 02:09:05.930]  Now we know that by day two they arrested anybody with cameras.
[02:09:06.130 --> 02:09:06.310]  Yes.
[02:09:06.410 --> 02:09:08.231]  They said no overflights, no cameras.
[02:09:08.671 --> 02:09:09.892]  Why would they say that?
[02:09:10.192 --> 02:09:11.253]  What did you see happen?
[02:09:11.393 --> 02:09:16.296]  One of the reasons that I can tell you that, and I'm sure that this is why they took the cameras away.
[02:09:16.396 --> 02:09:19.278]  First of all, they didn't take cameras away from everybody.
[02:09:19.638 --> 02:09:21.839]  They took them away from people they couldn't control.
[02:09:21.899 --> 02:09:23.360]  Yeah, FEMA was allowed to have cameras.
[02:09:23.460 --> 02:09:24.781]  FEMA was allowed to have cameras.
[02:09:24.841 --> 02:09:26.742]  Police, the Port Authority, certain.
[02:09:27.402 --> 02:09:33.225]  Certain people who I was attached to with were allowed to have cameras and I had a camera also.
[02:09:34.806 --> 02:09:43.850]  After my second full day there I just decided that it was stupid to pull my camera out unless I saw something absolutely that could not be passed up.
[02:09:44.431 --> 02:09:46.812]  Mostly what you saw was evidence of an implosion.
[02:09:47.472 --> 02:09:56.797]  Mostly what you saw was that there are cameras everywhere and more of what they say they couldn't catch on camera
[02:09:57.458 --> 02:10:01.299]  had to be caught on camera if it was on.
[02:10:02.539 --> 02:10:06.760]  And I have no reason to believe that those cameras were not working before or on that day.
[02:10:07.161 --> 02:10:08.381]  Now let's visit something else.
[02:10:08.541 --> 02:10:13.002]  I know for a fact because I believe you saw my certificates there.
[02:10:13.522 --> 02:10:15.403]  They are from FEMA, several of them.
[02:10:15.963 --> 02:10:19.844]  I am a FEMA trained person and FEMA certified.
[02:10:19.904 --> 02:10:24.385]  That means that if there's a situation in my area, even sick and laying down,
[02:10:25.437 --> 02:10:27.357]  Uh, semi-retired from what I'm doing.
[02:10:27.658 --> 02:10:36.179]  I, if I have the most experience, I am the OIC officer in charge until someone can relieve me who has more training.
[02:10:36.239 --> 02:10:37.020]  That's the law.
[02:10:37.820 --> 02:10:39.480]  There is a secret government.
[02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:40.140]  I'm sorry.
[02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:50.383]  It's not a secret anymore, but it is a government that's set up and they are a fear-based martial law solution.
[02:10:51.263 --> 02:10:52.323]  And that's what it's all about.
[02:10:53.231 --> 02:10:54.572]  They are, it's all about fear.
[02:10:54.712 --> 02:10:56.352]  But moving on, keeping on what we saw there.
[02:10:56.372 --> 02:10:57.493]  I want to go back to the cameras.
[02:10:58.073 --> 02:11:01.615]  Just like with the Pentagon, they go and they grab them at gas stations and hotels.
[02:11:01.655 --> 02:11:02.055]  That's right.
[02:11:02.895 --> 02:11:03.655]  Same thing here.
[02:11:03.676 --> 02:11:05.896]  There were all those businesses and other buildings.
[02:11:06.437 --> 02:11:10.118]  They counted it up, it was like 300 cameras that were aiming at the towers.
[02:11:10.198 --> 02:11:10.518]  That's right.
[02:11:10.578 --> 02:11:15.340]  But they declared national security on those tapes and people would try to sue to get them.
[02:11:15.421 --> 02:11:16.561]  What are they trying to hide?
[02:11:17.201 --> 02:11:18.682]  I think that they're trying to hide what
[02:11:19.404 --> 02:11:28.170]  There was a film there that was extremely hush-hush, and a lot of people are going to take offense with what I'm about to say, and to those people, I'm sorry.
[02:11:30.131 --> 02:11:34.854]  There is a film that shows firefighters breaking into an ATM machine.
[02:11:34.894 --> 02:11:38.736]  They stole over $470,000 in cash money.
[02:11:39.517 --> 02:11:41.238]  They didn't do anything to them.
[02:11:41.638 --> 02:11:41.978]  Why?
[02:11:42.418 --> 02:11:46.381]  Because America wouldn't understand, unquote,
[02:11:49.008 --> 02:11:53.152]  They let them get away with unreal stuff.
[02:11:54.734 --> 02:11:56.615]  There was rules and regulations.
[02:11:56.916 --> 02:11:59.418]  Only FDNY did not have to follow it.
[02:11:59.959 --> 02:12:12.911]  And it's been my experience in my life and in my line of things that I've done that the only people who are in charge are the ones who have car blocks to go wherever and do whatever they wish.
[02:12:13.991 --> 02:12:25.204]  I believe the NY knew ahead of time they may have been duped just like the military into believing that it was a training exercise and that's why so many of them were talking openly at first.
[02:12:25.811 --> 02:12:30.393]  But, the Secret Service was there on a regular basis.
[02:12:30.613 --> 02:12:46.461]  They did not hide who they were in any way, shape, or form, but they would discreetly speak with you, and I saw grown men who I've seen and who I know to be in gunfights and all kinds of different things turn pale as a ghost and speak not of what they were told.
[02:12:47.930 --> 02:12:50.052]  Now let's talk about the flight data recorders.
[02:12:50.512 --> 02:12:53.334]  It's been in the major publications.
[02:12:53.394 --> 02:12:55.156]  It's been in the Philadelphia Daily News.
[02:12:58.596 --> 02:13:17.512]  Search-and-rescue individuals, one of them very highly decorated like yourself, said that they physically, that three of the data recorders have been found, because, well, there's two data recorders and one voice recorder, there's two per plane, that three of them have been found, they were loaded on four-wheelers, and the FBI said, shut your mouth.
[02:13:17.553 --> 02:13:18.273]  What do you know about that?
[02:13:23.059 --> 02:13:30.824]  First of all, my understanding about those recorders, when they were found, is they were in pretty good shape for what they had supposedly been through.
[02:13:30.844 --> 02:13:31.785]  Yeah, that's what they said, yeah.
[02:13:31.925 --> 02:13:39.790]  Number two, one of the big problems was, is that they were trying to say that they found those boxes on three different occasions.
[02:13:40.991 --> 02:13:46.554]  Not just three boxes, but three different occasions, all of the boxes were found.
[02:13:47.114 --> 02:13:50.957]  So, in my opinion about that is, is that they're trying to
[02:13:52.140 --> 02:13:57.302]  Disqualify what these highly decorated and honest people said.
[02:13:58.022 --> 02:13:59.043]  We found the box.
[02:14:00.623 --> 02:14:10.907]  The reason that they're trying to disbunk all of this is because they wanted to have the box for longer so they could quote-unquote edit what they needed out for national security.
[02:14:12.122 --> 02:14:23.147]  I guess that must have been the remote control buttons going off and all, because I can't imagine what will be national security to not let us know, have a little bit of sense of peace, what really happens.
[02:14:23.167 --> 02:14:25.508]  Well, they ordered the FAA to shred all the tapes.
[02:14:25.729 --> 02:14:26.329]  Absolutely.
[02:14:26.409 --> 02:14:27.309]  That's against the law.
[02:14:27.930 --> 02:14:41.316]  And also, I'd like to know why that when I fly my Cessna, if I just falter off path a little bit, I have a radio call, you know, Cessna 098, November, where are you going?
[02:14:43.058 --> 02:14:44.518]  Where are you going?
[02:14:45.339 --> 02:14:47.760]  You mean to tell me they lost some people for all that time?
[02:14:48.140 --> 02:14:54.083]  You mean to tell me a supersonic jet that can go three times the Mach speed couldn't get to those people?
[02:14:55.144 --> 02:14:57.245]  Something's wrong to high heaven and down.
[02:14:57.265 --> 02:15:03.408]  There's no way what they said is true from anything that you say to me, Alex.
[02:15:04.048 --> 02:15:07.730]  There's so much stuff that sometimes you can't even remember all of it.
[02:15:09.005 --> 02:15:27.627]  Let's talk about, before we take some calls and get back into more of the 9-11 cover-up, let's talk about, I mean, they admit those buildings, the pillars were coated in asbestos, which is another reason they couldn't burn or melt, folks, but that place was pulverized, turned into dust,
[02:15:28.462 --> 02:15:34.227]  And then Bush does support the firefighters, the rescue workers, but then he blocked the 90 plus million for medical treatment.
[02:15:34.367 --> 02:15:35.128]  Right, and you know what?
[02:15:35.148 --> 02:15:56.466]  When you burn metal at that rate, and anybody who knows anything about being there, there was a hose running non-stop on that fire, because the metal was burning like at the heat of magnesium damn near, and it was so hot that what they were trying to do was not necessarily put out the fire, but mist
[02:15:57.353 --> 02:16:03.015]  The particulates that were in the air had to be watered down and dropped.
[02:16:20.690 --> 02:16:30.556]  And, uh, there were only certain parts of the site that you could not legally leave without going through decontamination.
[02:16:31.677 --> 02:16:32.417]  Now let's explain.
[02:16:32.457 --> 02:16:38.361]  If jet fuel is coal-burning, and people are standing in the holes in the buildings after the... That's not possible.
[02:16:38.965 --> 02:16:39.805]  That's not possible.
[02:16:39.865 --> 02:16:40.645]  Exactly.
[02:16:40.906 --> 02:16:45.747]  So how did we get then these white hot fires that were still burning weeks later?
[02:16:46.487 --> 02:16:50.528]  Some people call them sub-atomic nuclear controlled explosions.
[02:16:51.688 --> 02:16:53.249]  Some people call them tactical nukes.
[02:16:55.690 --> 02:16:58.550]  Well the question is, I mean, we have the thermal photos.
[02:16:58.610 --> 02:17:03.492]  How do you weeks later have stuff burning molten down in there?
[02:17:04.112 --> 02:17:05.132]  There's only one way.
[02:17:05.152 --> 02:17:08.153]  There had to be a combination of some very high powerful stuff.
[02:17:08.675 --> 02:17:14.404]  And when that stuff all closed in on itself, it just burned and burned because it was burning.
[02:17:14.444 --> 02:17:18.190]  I mean, that is not a lie or something like that.
[02:17:18.251 --> 02:17:20.855]  That smoke came out and it burned like crazy.
[02:17:22.213 --> 02:17:23.675]  It was unreal, that fire.
[02:17:23.755 --> 02:17:26.518]  Well, I want to talk about the health problems you and the others have had.
[02:17:26.578 --> 02:17:27.659]  I mean, it's admitted.
[02:17:28.219 --> 02:17:30.181]  They call it the WTC cough.
[02:17:30.301 --> 02:17:30.462]  Yep.
[02:17:30.922 --> 02:17:32.263]  A lot of people died from it.
[02:17:32.724 --> 02:17:32.904]  Yes.
[02:17:33.264 --> 02:17:35.947]  The government says, shut up, you're not getting anything.
[02:17:35.967 --> 02:17:38.129]  If you don't know what you're talking about, you're crazy.
[02:17:38.550 --> 02:17:40.832]  And the Red Cross is going to keep the money for themselves.
[02:17:41.433 --> 02:17:43.355]  Well, they only give away some
[02:17:44.356 --> 02:17:49.837]  I think they keep 20% off the... My doctor was truly amazed at the improvements my heart showed after my heart attack.
[02:17:50.117 --> 02:17:51.298]  Thank you, Cardivite.
[02:17:51.338 --> 02:17:56.319]  I was having a hard time breathing and had to rest in the afternoons, but since Cardivite, that's all changed now.
[02:17:56.399 --> 02:17:59.940]  I've had chronic fatigue for 12 years now and decided to try Cardivite.
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:01.980]  Boy, it's improved my energy dramatically.
[02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:03.021]  Cardivite.
[02:18:03.061 --> 02:18:04.561]  We all use Cardivite!
[02:18:05.476 --> 02:18:08.958]  Ladies and gentlemen, Heart Drop 2000 presents Cardivite.
[02:18:09.419 --> 02:18:15.743]  Cardivite is an all-natural supplement which is made up of our own special blend of herbs gathered from many different parts of the world.
[02:18:15.883 --> 02:18:21.026]  Specially designed to improve your health, come on and care about yourself just a little more with Cardivite.
[02:18:21.187 --> 02:18:25.249]  You can find more information at www.karelvite.us or call 1-877-928-8822.
[02:18:25.309 --> 02:18:26.110]  That's 1-877-928-8822.
[02:18:35.456 --> 02:18:36.740]  I don't think so.
[02:18:45.609 --> 02:18:48.892]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:18:48.932 --> 02:18:53.135]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:18:53.375 --> 02:18:56.177]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:18:56.357 --> 02:18:58.759]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:18:58.939 --> 02:19:07.606]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:19:07.786 --> 02:19:09.147]  The Berkey light is different.
[02:19:09.327 --> 02:19:13.490]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:19:13.810 --> 02:19:14.331]  We're good to go.
[02:19:43.490 --> 02:19:44.262]  We're good to go.
[02:19:46.286 --> 02:19:48.527]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[02:19:48.947 --> 02:19:53.309]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[02:19:53.569 --> 02:19:59.392]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[02:19:59.612 --> 02:20:03.673]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[02:20:03.954 --> 02:20:09.596]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[02:20:09.716 --> 02:20:12.337]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[02:20:14.418 --> 02:20:18.321]  By mid 1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[02:20:18.361 --> 02:20:20.763]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[02:20:21.083 --> 02:20:23.385]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[02:20:23.765 --> 02:20:27.388]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[02:20:27.868 --> 02:20:34.073]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[02:20:34.513 --> 02:20:35.494]  You'll be glad you did.
[02:20:35.854 --> 02:20:36.275]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:36.315 --> 02:20:36.555]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:45.985 --> 02:20:47.125]  All water isn't the same.
[02:20:47.405 --> 02:20:52.407]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[02:20:52.667 --> 02:20:55.248]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[02:20:55.468 --> 02:21:03.990]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.
[02:21:04.390 --> 02:21:12.815]  Aquanorthwest.com carries a full line of products that will increase the water's energy by creating a positive spin and revitalizing water in a high vibration state.
[02:21:12.955 --> 02:21:16.397]  For example, Aquanorthwest.com offers an energy gel mug.
[02:21:16.637 --> 02:21:24.082]  Simply place any liquid in the energy gel mug and in just minutes your water is positively charged and ready to enter your body in the most impressionable state.
[02:21:24.402 --> 02:21:26.383]  You've all heard about products that energize your water.
[02:21:26.443 --> 02:21:27.804]  Don't be fooled by imitators.
[02:21:27.904 --> 02:21:32.727]  Visit Aquanorthwest.com to learn more about the benefits of positively charged energy water.
[02:21:33.047 --> 02:21:36.070]  Call 888-7-AQUA-NW.
[02:21:36.230 --> 02:21:37.271]  That's 888-727-8269.
[02:21:38.011 --> 02:21:46.658]  Or visit Aquanorthwest.com.
[02:21:47.159 --> 02:21:54.265]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:21:54.665 --> 02:21:57.788]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:02.213 --> 02:22:04.595]  We're talking to Sergeant Matthew Tartaglia.
[02:22:05.716 --> 02:22:06.977]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:22:06.997 --> 02:22:16.084]  We're going to go to your calls, David and Mark and Chris and Richard and Harvey and everybody else here in just a few minutes.
[02:22:16.765 --> 02:22:18.166]  Continuing with the health problems.
[02:22:18.326 --> 02:22:19.407]  Again, it is admitted
[02:22:20.513 --> 02:22:28.875]  Uh, that the rescue workers and New Yorkers period, but especially rescue workers, breathed all this asbestos and other chemicals and there weren't treatments for all of this.
[02:22:28.895 --> 02:22:40.678]  Uh, but Bush personally, uh, had the Congress shut down the money, the 90 plus million, because that would have been an admission of, uh, exposure.
[02:22:41.808 --> 02:22:49.852]  And just denied you guys that and I mean, what have the health problems been like for yourself and your friends and others that were there?
[02:22:50.333 --> 02:22:54.475]  Most everybody has a chronic sinusitis.
[02:22:55.315 --> 02:22:56.876]  They have ringing of the ears.
[02:22:57.876 --> 02:23:00.938]  Some people's teeth and gums are bothering them.
[02:23:01.678 --> 02:23:03.939]  In the last year I've lost seven teeth.
[02:23:04.480 --> 02:23:07.021]  They just have broken while I was eating.
[02:23:08.431 --> 02:23:16.078]  Uh, I have three or four more teeth that are just, they're dying and my, my dentist said I've never seen anything like this in someone who's healthy.
[02:23:16.719 --> 02:23:22.485]  There's something wrong with you but I cannot find what it is and I can't stop it either.
[02:23:23.246 --> 02:23:24.427]  Did you see the new scientists?
[02:23:24.447 --> 02:23:30.711]  They did the scans, CAT scans of the lungs, and everybody they tested, it just was filled with asbestos?
[02:23:30.771 --> 02:23:39.416]  Yes, I have 90, the doctor said to me, I have 97% of the population in America breathe more efficiently than I do.
[02:23:40.975 --> 02:23:44.277]  And that most of the people who are in that 3% are the people from Ground Zero.
[02:23:44.557 --> 02:23:50.041]  And with debilitating deathbed type of lung problems.
[02:23:50.381 --> 02:23:51.802]  Now you've had friends that have died?
[02:23:51.962 --> 02:23:52.222]  Yes.
[02:23:53.123 --> 02:23:59.346]  My Roland was our supervisor.
[02:23:59.506 --> 02:24:04.509]  He's the person who initiated me into Critical Infinite Stress Management.
[02:24:04.650 --> 02:24:07.791]  He's the person who made sure that my training was up to par.
[02:24:07.892 --> 02:24:10.213]  He's the person who I went to as a confidant.
[02:24:11.119 --> 02:24:19.266]  And on December 31st he went home, and on January 1st he dropped dead from a massive heart attack in his house.
[02:24:20.687 --> 02:24:22.668]  Had he been having health problems?
[02:24:23.089 --> 02:24:27.192]  He had been having health problems, just like mine, just like the people who were there.
[02:24:27.272 --> 02:24:34.658]  But one thing that he did not stick to, that we did stick to, is that we allowed ourselves a week break between our time.
[02:24:35.118 --> 02:24:37.340]  Roland was there all the time.
[02:24:38.348 --> 02:24:47.192]  He gave his life to make sure that the problems at Ground Zero stayed at Ground Zero for the most part, but got worked out too.
[02:24:48.272 --> 02:25:01.538]  Now, they admit that this has happened to the people there, and 14 search and rescue dogs have died of these bizarre nasal cancers.
[02:25:01.578 --> 02:25:03.899]  They found the asbestos in them as well.
[02:25:04.539 --> 02:25:06.520]  There's also all the heavy metals that were there.
[02:25:07.559 --> 02:25:14.065]  Uh, what happens when you, I mean, what was the effect on the rescue workers when the medical treatment money got blocked?
[02:25:15.667 --> 02:25:18.509]  Well, some people committed suicide.
[02:25:20.071 --> 02:25:21.212]  Some people went crazy.
[02:25:22.333 --> 02:25:30.860]  Some people lost their wives or husbands because they, their spouse, unless you were there, it's like Vietnam, when someone says, hey, if you weren't there, you don't have any idea.
[02:25:30.880 --> 02:25:32.562]  You really don't.
[02:25:34.171 --> 02:25:45.000]  When you know the truth about something and you can't talk about it and not even your wife or anything like that and you have these eruptions of character they're called.
[02:25:45.561 --> 02:25:55.770]  Well you were saying also that you were debriefing people as a counselor as well and that just the stuff they were talking about just showed what a fraud the official story was.
[02:25:55.790 --> 02:25:57.252]  What are some examples of that?
[02:25:57.672 --> 02:25:59.293]  Some of the examples were the
[02:26:01.408 --> 02:26:04.010]  Availability for the blood for instance.
[02:26:04.430 --> 02:26:11.494]  Someone said to me that his co-worker had gotten sick because he was moving bad blood around.
[02:26:12.554 --> 02:26:14.115]  Well bad blood is unplugged blood.
[02:26:14.255 --> 02:26:18.077]  It wasn't plugged in and apparently either he got sick.
[02:26:18.197 --> 02:26:27.102]  I really didn't understand whether the man just threw up and was getting sick by seeing what he saw or that he had actually been getting sick from contamination.
[02:26:27.162 --> 02:26:29.143]  I believe it's the first of the two to be honest with you.
[02:26:29.730 --> 02:26:40.642]  However, there were people who, um, officers who went in afterwards and the last thing they said to their partner was, Oh my God, it's exploding.
[02:26:40.802 --> 02:26:42.064]  Oh my God, it's exploding.
[02:26:43.923 --> 02:26:46.365]  So, what was he talking about?
[02:26:46.505 --> 02:26:47.386]  Well, it's the same thing.
[02:26:47.466 --> 02:26:52.249]  We have firefighters in the new film saying, look at the bombs going off, it looks like detonators.
[02:26:52.489 --> 02:26:52.709]  Right.
[02:26:53.129 --> 02:26:56.592]  And we have the video of the blast points going down the sides of the building.
[02:26:56.892 --> 02:26:58.193]  What about Larry Silberstein?
[02:26:58.213 --> 02:26:59.434]  I mean, he says they pulled it.
[02:26:59.874 --> 02:27:03.456]  We have the New York Fire Department telling AP reporters, get back, we're going to pull it.
[02:27:03.917 --> 02:27:05.037]  That is the demolition term.
[02:27:05.057 --> 02:27:05.398]  Yes, it is.
[02:27:05.798 --> 02:27:07.279]  Did you run across any of that?
[02:27:07.459 --> 02:27:08.219]  Yes.
[02:27:08.300 --> 02:27:09.240]  They pulled seven.
[02:27:09.460 --> 02:27:10.841]  There's no two ways about that.
[02:27:10.881 --> 02:27:11.582]  And that's about money.
[02:27:12.589 --> 02:27:16.390]  Every building that, uh, you just said the man's name.
[02:27:16.410 --> 02:27:17.630]  Silverstein.
[02:27:17.790 --> 02:27:18.390]  Right, Silverstein.
[02:27:18.410 --> 02:27:19.231]  Thanks very much.
[02:27:19.271 --> 02:27:23.492]  Every building that he owned is gone, and it's being rebuilt, or is rebuilt.
[02:27:24.252 --> 02:27:26.732]  And he just purchased those right before.
[02:27:27.613 --> 02:27:29.933]  And that is one of the things that someone said to me.
[02:27:29.973 --> 02:27:30.693]  You got a break.
[02:27:30.713 --> 02:27:31.834]  I want to hear about it when we get back.
[02:27:31.854 --> 02:27:32.794]  We'll go right to calls.
[02:27:33.234 --> 02:27:33.634]  Stay with us.
[02:27:36.097 --> 02:27:37.000]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.501 --> 02:27:39.107]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.030 --> 02:27:42.699]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:48.115 --> 02:27:53.617]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:54.037 --> 02:27:58.258]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:27:58.498 --> 02:28:05.540]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:05.900 --> 02:28:12.022]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:12.162 --> 02:28:13.382]  There are no side effects.
[02:28:13.722 --> 02:28:16.665]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:28:16.825 --> 02:28:18.847]  Eliminate the cost, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:28:19.148 --> 02:28:26.395]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:28:26.695 --> 02:28:30.099]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[02:28:45.572 --> 02:28:51.815]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:28:51.955 --> 02:28:58.118]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:28:58.398 --> 02:29:06.822]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:29:07.083 --> 02:29:14.106]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:29:14.406 --> 02:29:19.230]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:29:19.450 --> 02:29:24.853]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:29:25.194 --> 02:29:28.276]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:29:28.616 --> 02:29:36.522]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:36.622 --> 02:29:37.182]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:44.087 --> 02:29:44.374]  We're good.
[02:29:45.151 --> 02:29:46.832]  Soon, the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[02:29:47.033 --> 02:29:49.034]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[02:29:49.254 --> 02:29:49.935]  Prepare yourself.
[02:29:50.095 --> 02:29:53.798]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.

[02:30:54.068 --> 02:31:00.653]  The globalists are building their entire police state, their control grid, on the foundation of 9-11.
[02:31:02.495 --> 02:31:10.861]  They were already setting up their police state before 9-11, and they said, oh, the terrorists are about to attack, and when they attack, give up all your rights, and then you'll get security.
[02:31:12.422 --> 02:31:18.387]  And then the terrorists did attack, and now they're saying, okay, now the next attack's gonna be bigger, and we're gonna take even more of your rights.
[02:31:18.427 --> 02:31:20.108]  This is the new way of life, okay?
[02:31:20.148 --> 02:31:22.650]  But the borders are gonna stay wide open.
[02:31:24.016 --> 02:31:30.099]  My new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State, is really three films in one.
[02:31:30.339 --> 02:31:32.199]  We cover the latest police state developments.
[02:31:32.780 --> 02:31:33.980]  We go to ground zero.
[02:31:34.020 --> 02:31:37.262]  We document what really happened on 9-11 like no other film does.
[02:31:38.382 --> 02:31:41.143]  We detail how the globalists carried out September 11th.
[02:31:41.343 --> 02:31:44.004]  We tell it like it is.
[02:31:46.045 --> 02:31:47.006]  We don't mince words.
[02:31:47.966 --> 02:31:52.388]  In the third part, we show the driving ideology, the philosophy of the New World Order.
[02:31:53.317 --> 02:31:59.561]  We show the Nazi death cult connections to Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, The Bushes, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[02:32:00.462 --> 02:32:01.963]  It is such an important film.
[02:32:02.623 --> 02:32:05.045]  It is really getting rave reviews.
[02:32:05.065 --> 02:32:08.247]  And I'm very proud of the film.
[02:32:09.022 --> 02:32:12.363]  It's $25.95, 2 hours, 35 minutes long.
[02:32:12.923 --> 02:32:18.305]  You're authorized for non-profit educational purposes to make copies of it, to spread it around.
[02:32:18.345 --> 02:32:19.785]  That's how it will have a big effect.
[02:32:20.125 --> 02:32:26.587]  This film will not be seen, this film will not have an effect, unless you order it, and unless you make some copies of it.
[02:32:27.127 --> 02:32:31.489]  Please, and those that have made copies of my other films in the past, thank you.
[02:32:31.929 --> 02:32:33.049]  Please get this video.
[02:32:33.489 --> 02:32:36.410]  Please make more copies of it than you may have any other film I've made.
[02:32:37.259 --> 02:32:38.200]  Get them out to people.
[02:32:38.300 --> 02:32:39.421]  Air them on AXS TV.
[02:32:39.861 --> 02:32:42.002]  Get them out to public officials, people in your area.
[02:32:42.383 --> 02:32:44.064]  The toll-free number to get this new video is 1-888-253-3139.
[02:32:44.124 --> 02:32:45.465]  Again, that's 1-888-253-3139.
[02:32:45.485 --> 02:32:50.668]  Or you can just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[02:33:08.135 --> 02:33:13.298]  Or you can go to PrisonPlanet.tv and watch it online.
[02:33:13.798 --> 02:33:16.419]  High bandwidth or low bandwidth, depending on your connection.
[02:33:17.040 --> 02:33:21.222]  All my other 12 films, my weekly TV report.
[02:33:21.262 --> 02:33:24.363]  We've had PrisonPlanet.tv coming up on a year.
[02:33:24.584 --> 02:33:25.584]  That much time has gone by.
[02:33:25.604 --> 02:33:29.186]  There's a whole year of weekly TV shows there, or like 11 months of them.
[02:33:30.689 --> 02:33:37.873]  So there's PrisonPlanet.TV where you can read my book, Paul Watson's book, it's all there.
[02:33:37.953 --> 02:33:41.395]  Dozens of other great films we've posted, we've been authorized to post.
[02:33:41.795 --> 02:33:49.600]  My best audio interviews for the radio show, PrisonPlanet.TV, monthly and yearly subscriptions, 15 cents a day.
[02:33:50.120 --> 02:33:51.561]  A coffee costs you about $1.50.
[02:33:51.701 --> 02:33:55.343]  It just makes it possible for us to pay for the bandwidth.
[02:33:56.023 --> 02:33:58.485]  We still put a lot of video out for free for everybody.
[02:33:58.525 --> 02:33:58.825]  In fact,
[02:33:59.602 --> 02:34:10.345]  I'd say now about 40% of Martial Law is posted on segments on PrisonPlanet.com for free for people that don't want to pay the 15 cents.
[02:34:11.205 --> 02:34:13.806]  My goal is to simply get the word out to people.
[02:34:13.886 --> 02:34:17.847]  So please call and get Martial Law and get some of the other videos.
[02:34:18.448 --> 02:34:20.328]  To get the three-tape special you save $18.
[02:34:22.269 --> 02:34:24.409]  I want to go to some calls now.
[02:34:24.429 --> 02:34:26.350]  We're talking to Sergeant Matthew
[02:34:27.507 --> 02:34:29.608]  Uh, who's just done an incredible job.
[02:34:30.408 --> 02:34:37.570]  And, uh, Matthew, uh, everything you've said just confirmed the information we already have, other than the looting.
[02:34:37.630 --> 02:34:38.810]  I heard a lot of looting went on.
[02:34:39.410 --> 02:34:53.694]  What about the... Now, the government admits over a hundred billion dollars in a Federal Reserve gold reserve that was in the bottom of the buildings, uh, down in the basement, obviously, where they told the rescue workers not to go.
[02:34:55.777 --> 02:35:01.446]  Were you there during the later period of excavation when they did go into those areas?
[02:35:01.486 --> 02:35:01.747]  Yes.
[02:35:02.027 --> 02:35:03.369]  Because gold isn't destroyed.
[02:35:03.409 --> 02:35:05.393]  I mean, gold isn't destroyed.
[02:35:09.208 --> 02:35:14.312]  All that would happen is it would melt and move about, but it would still be collectible.
[02:35:14.492 --> 02:35:24.500]  It's a very... With all these thousands and thousands and thousands of giant gold bars in those vaults, which they admit was there, were you guys discussing that, or was there any... Yes, there were discussions about it.
[02:35:24.840 --> 02:35:37.911]  There was, like, the, you know, the humorous, oh, I'll get one of those, you know, I'll be set for life type things, but it was people, I mean, they were seeing it, but the only people who were allowed in were special operations or
[02:35:38.787 --> 02:35:41.228]  Um, whether it be military or police.
[02:35:42.028 --> 02:35:45.929]  And, uh, it was very, very strict about that.
[02:35:46.509 --> 02:35:47.690]  And then there was no discussion.
[02:35:47.710 --> 02:35:48.810]  They admit the gold was there.
[02:35:48.830 --> 02:35:50.250]  I have articles pre 9-11.
[02:35:50.310 --> 02:35:50.530]  Right.
[02:35:50.650 --> 02:35:53.891]  These giant gold vaults are there, and then there's no discussion of it.
[02:35:54.091 --> 02:35:59.493]  And then they said that they must have moved it, or it was destroyed.
[02:35:59.553 --> 02:36:07.055]  Because then, what, the last thing that was said was, oh my God, you know, where did this gold go to?
[02:36:08.374 --> 02:36:12.958]  So, you have some people... A lot of people think the Globalists took the gold out before him.
[02:36:13.598 --> 02:36:15.840]  Well, if I was them, I probably would have, too.
[02:36:16.020 --> 02:36:16.740]  You know what I mean?
[02:36:16.760 --> 02:36:36.976]  I don't want to sound like I support anything that they did or are doing, but you have to admit the way they're doing this is extremely tyrannical, and, you know, aside from not being able to keep a secret to save their lives, and bragging like crazy on television,
[02:36:37.894 --> 02:36:42.457]  Um, they really can't, you know, they can't keep a secret.
[02:36:42.998 --> 02:36:45.139]  But these people are, they're really furious.
[02:36:45.159 --> 02:36:58.849]  My last point, have you heard about this high-level Army official who's now gone public in federal court, released the documents, they're not being disputed, that the Army did drills in 76 of hijacked jets, hijacked by box cutters, wielding Arabs?
[02:36:58.949 --> 02:36:59.469]  Absolutely.
[02:37:00.410 --> 02:37:04.453]  I studied those in my, if you noticed, some of my certificates of training.
[02:37:04.973 --> 02:37:09.737]  Preparation for Terrorism, Terrorism Awareness, First Responder, etc.
[02:37:10.557 --> 02:37:15.361]  Those were all studied, and they were studied pre and post 9-11.
[02:37:15.581 --> 02:37:16.582]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:37:16.642 --> 02:37:21.686]  I mean, I have the 1999 FEMA Terrorism Report, and it's got crosshairs right on the towers.
[02:37:21.706 --> 02:37:22.246]  Yes, it does.
[02:37:22.567 --> 02:37:25.669]  Yes, I have the same exact document, actually.
[02:37:25.829 --> 02:37:30.012]  Was there any discussions, and by the way, that's in the extras of Road to Tyranny, that DVD.
[02:37:30.913 --> 02:37:33.435]  What about, there's so many questions here, but
[02:37:34.128 --> 02:37:37.271]  I mean, how many people were talking at Ground Zero?
[02:37:37.311 --> 02:37:40.834]  Did anybody get an inkling that, man, guys with box cutters couldn't do this?
[02:37:40.954 --> 02:37:43.156]  What did they say when they said, oh, we found a passport?
[02:37:43.376 --> 02:37:44.177]  Everybody said the same thing.
[02:37:44.197 --> 02:37:45.818]  When they said we found a passport, what did they say?
[02:37:46.479 --> 02:37:49.021]  To tell you the truth, that's when it really started to get hot.
[02:37:49.901 --> 02:37:50.702]  If you know what I mean?
[02:37:51.042 --> 02:37:57.928]  People really started getting upset about that because if you had been there, you would have known that no passport would have made it down.
[02:37:58.469 --> 02:38:01.111]  You would know it instinctively.
[02:38:01.943 --> 02:38:03.504]  And people started looking at each other.
[02:38:03.564 --> 02:38:04.745]  People started getting afraid.
[02:38:05.046 --> 02:38:07.628]  There was like an us and them right there on the site.
[02:38:08.188 --> 02:38:11.211]  Well, you don't have clearance, so I can't talk to you.
[02:38:12.031 --> 02:38:12.812]  At least not right now.
[02:38:12.832 --> 02:38:14.273]  I'll talk to you later when we're drinking.
[02:38:14.733 --> 02:38:15.674]  And that's the way it was.
[02:38:16.094 --> 02:38:21.439]  More information came out at the pubs than they did at the stations.
[02:38:21.459 --> 02:38:25.062]  So what were people saying when they were on the news going, we found a ring with blood on it.
[02:38:25.142 --> 02:38:26.002]  It's the hijacker.
[02:38:26.223 --> 02:38:27.644]  We found two passports.
[02:38:27.964 --> 02:38:30.326]  I mean, what were people saying at the bars minus the profanity?
[02:38:32.426 --> 02:38:33.267]  I can imagine, yeah.
[02:38:34.188 --> 02:38:36.530]  They were of gas.
[02:38:36.770 --> 02:38:41.613]  To tell you the truth, there's a lot of people who were really ready to quit their jobs and walk away.
[02:38:42.214 --> 02:38:47.038]  There are people who have walked away from their jobs as a result of their involvement.
[02:38:47.538 --> 02:38:51.501]  And their lives and everything have picked up and done their exodus, if you will.
[02:38:51.781 --> 02:38:52.482]  They've left.
[02:38:52.782 --> 02:38:53.583]  Because they know.
[02:38:53.603 --> 02:38:54.363]  They do know.
[02:38:54.383 --> 02:38:55.584]  It's happening.
[02:38:55.664 --> 02:38:56.825]  It really is happening.
[02:38:59.730 --> 02:39:05.679]  People want to play ostrich and they think that if... You know, in traffic sometimes you see this phenomenon all the time.
[02:39:06.180 --> 02:39:10.907]  People see an 18-wheeler making a turn around a really precarious turn.
[02:39:11.653 --> 02:39:14.515]  And it looks like it could maybe possibly hit their car.
[02:39:14.695 --> 02:39:15.316]  What do they do?
[02:39:15.776 --> 02:39:16.436]  Look away.
[02:39:16.776 --> 02:39:18.117]  They don't move their vehicle.
[02:39:18.398 --> 02:39:20.779]  They don't look to see if there's somewhere that they can back up.
[02:39:21.059 --> 02:39:22.420]  They look away.
[02:39:22.500 --> 02:39:24.121]  I've noticed that they disassociate.
[02:39:24.321 --> 02:39:24.762]  That's right.
[02:39:24.902 --> 02:39:25.742]  Let's go to some calls.
[02:39:25.762 --> 02:39:32.026]  Yeah, because they think that the world is inside their head and that they govern reality with their imaginary little world.
[02:39:32.327 --> 02:39:35.108]  David in California, thanks for holding her on the air with our guest.
[02:39:35.609 --> 02:39:36.750]  Hey, how you doing, Matthew?
[02:39:36.930 --> 02:39:37.450]  How you doing?
[02:39:37.910 --> 02:39:38.411]  I'm great.
[02:39:38.431 --> 02:39:39.712]  Hey, God bless you, first of all.
[02:39:40.885 --> 02:39:43.346]  Just always remember that he's in charge, man.
[02:39:43.366 --> 02:39:44.226]  Oh yes, amen.
[02:39:44.406 --> 02:39:47.067]  We don't have to worry about too much because he's in charge.
[02:39:47.507 --> 02:40:07.134]  Hey, what I wanted to ask specifically, do you, I've heard reports, I've heard innuendo that some of the security companies that were in the World Trade Centers were dealing in DD-214 forms, that they were selling essentially
[02:40:10.437 --> 02:40:20.121]  Military registration, birth certificates, so on and so forth, with respect to military personnel.
[02:40:20.621 --> 02:40:22.542]  Have you heard of anything like that?
[02:40:22.742 --> 02:40:25.262]  Is there anything that you might be able to shed light on?
[02:40:25.623 --> 02:40:30.384]  They did a lot of their insider trading, the CIA did, out of the buildings before they do it.
[02:40:30.684 --> 02:40:38.167]  What the mafia or the criminals will do is they'll move a bunch of criminal operations six months before they do something into something they're going to torch.
[02:40:39.341 --> 02:40:40.443]  Yes, I do have a comment on that.
[02:40:53.684 --> 02:41:06.894]  You're referring to, and if it's the same thing that I'm aware of, what happened is there are some people who are defecting and running away, like I just suggested, and they sold their identifications beforehand to buy some time for themselves.
[02:41:07.455 --> 02:41:11.078]  I'm sorry to anybody who got hurt, but that's the truth of the matter.
[02:41:11.158 --> 02:41:15.121]  They sold their identities to buy time for themselves.
[02:41:16.454 --> 02:41:17.775]  All right, David, thanks for the call.
[02:41:17.956 --> 02:41:20.138]  Up next is Mark in Nevada.
[02:41:20.538 --> 02:41:21.359]  Mark, you're on the air.
[02:41:21.399 --> 02:41:21.819]  Go ahead.
[02:41:21.980 --> 02:41:22.760]  Hey, how are you guys doing?
[02:41:22.820 --> 02:41:23.101]  Good.
[02:41:23.121 --> 02:41:29.387]  I want to say I'm sorry to hear the way the firefighters have been treated and everything, but I can't say I'm surprised.
[02:41:29.407 --> 02:41:34.192]  I was in the Marine Corps myself, and I was injured by the anthrax shot.
[02:41:34.804 --> 02:41:36.885]  And they made us take those shots even though we were about to get out.
[02:41:36.945 --> 02:41:39.406]  I've had health problems ever since, and they did the same thing to us veterans.
[02:41:39.646 --> 02:41:41.187]  And I'm gonna add this, I gotta add this.
[02:41:41.647 --> 02:41:43.808]  It was a federal crime every time they did that.
[02:41:43.848 --> 02:41:45.228]  Those were experimental shots.
[02:41:45.308 --> 02:41:45.709]  It was.
[02:41:45.809 --> 02:41:50.170]  Even if you're in the military, you've gotta give them your consent, and they didn't do that.
[02:41:50.751 --> 02:41:55.073]  Yep, and I serve my old time honorably, and they treat us like we're nothing but Kleenex, you know?
[02:41:55.813 --> 02:42:03.376]  I'm not surprised, but I wanna ask you about World Trade Center 7, where Giuliani and Jerome Hauer had their little headquarters set up.
[02:42:03.800 --> 02:42:08.302]  I'm wondering, have you heard about what WTC7 was actually used for?
[02:42:08.322 --> 02:42:18.526]  WTC7 was, from my understanding, it was set up the day before and the day before that, as early as the 9th, to run this exercise.
[02:42:19.033 --> 02:42:25.775]  They pulled that building because there was no way that they could conceivably move the data that was in there.
[02:42:26.195 --> 02:42:27.576]  They accomplished what they wanted.
[02:42:34.878 --> 02:42:36.099]  It's not possible.
[02:42:36.179 --> 02:42:37.060]  It is not possible.
[02:42:37.140 --> 02:42:38.481]  Mathematically, the potential for that
[02:43:04.378 --> 02:43:08.560]  It's so far away that you'll time travel before that will happen.
[02:43:09.400 --> 02:43:10.361]  That's a good way to put it.
[02:43:11.221 --> 02:43:11.541]  You know?
[02:43:11.561 --> 02:43:14.103]  I mean, were there any comments about 7?
[02:43:15.483 --> 02:43:16.564]  You said you were there that night.
[02:43:16.584 --> 02:43:20.065]  I mean, 7, 5.30 at night, falls perfectly?
[02:43:21.106 --> 02:43:25.508]  When 7 fell, there was a few people on the fence.
[02:43:26.368 --> 02:43:27.809]  They got off the fence very quickly.
[02:43:27.849 --> 02:43:28.709]  They knew what happened.
[02:43:28.990 --> 02:43:31.811]  We had just watched two buildings fall identically.
[02:43:32.595 --> 02:43:33.676]  What plane hit 7?
[02:43:33.736 --> 02:43:37.080]  Please tell me which plane hit 7, because I don't know about it.
[02:43:37.440 --> 02:43:39.222]  Oh, by the way, the new FEMA report?
[02:43:39.522 --> 02:43:42.205]  There's been a new government report just put out, commissioned by FEMA.
[02:43:42.525 --> 02:43:44.948]  First they said they don't know why it fell, then a gas tank.
[02:43:44.988 --> 02:43:46.489]  No, it wasn't a fuel oil tank.
[02:43:46.829 --> 02:43:53.276]  Now they're saying that the North Tower hit it, but in their own official debris field map,
[02:43:54.516 --> 02:43:55.997]  The North Tower didn't hit it.
[02:43:56.337 --> 02:44:00.459]  Now they're saying the North Tower hit it and knocked out its main support column.
[02:44:00.499 --> 02:44:01.099]  Oh boy.
[02:44:01.459 --> 02:44:05.901]  If what they said was true, most of Manhattan would be flattened.
[02:44:06.061 --> 02:44:07.522]  Well, I've been there.
[02:44:07.602 --> 02:44:08.482]  I've got the video.
[02:44:08.542 --> 02:44:10.043]  They admit it didn't hit Building 7.
[02:44:10.323 --> 02:44:11.784]  It fell straight down.
[02:44:11.844 --> 02:44:14.845]  The furthest anything went was 75-something feet.
[02:44:14.945 --> 02:44:15.265]  That's it.
[02:44:17.282 --> 02:44:19.464]  Nothing went beyond 75 feet.
[02:44:20.044 --> 02:44:26.789]  But, I mean, that's admitted, but now the government's put out a new report going 7 fell because the North Tower hit it.
[02:44:27.030 --> 02:44:28.371]  Yeah, that's not true at all.
[02:44:28.411 --> 02:44:31.453]  I mean, they might as well say because Donald Duck chewed through the girders.
[02:44:31.693 --> 02:44:40.700]  Well, I'd like to say something that we've not touched on at all and that it's just too wacky for me to even believe that no one's paying attention to.
[02:44:41.240 --> 02:44:42.061]  Under the law,
[02:44:42.995 --> 02:44:58.038]  The airport that George Bush would have had to fly out of would have been closed and it would have been considered a national threat of security because of its size and its proximity to where the president was that day.
[02:44:58.458 --> 02:45:07.960]  In addition to which, the principal of that school that morning said, George, the president came in and said that the World Trade Center had been hit
[02:45:08.427 --> 02:45:10.227]  But we were going to go ahead anyway.
[02:45:10.588 --> 02:45:11.948]  He thought it was a Cessna.
[02:45:12.448 --> 02:45:16.189]  Normally, if anything happens, he stops his whole agenda.
[02:45:16.209 --> 02:45:17.629]  That's why he's called negligent.
[02:45:17.729 --> 02:45:19.590]  He is negligent.
[02:45:21.510 --> 02:45:22.510]  Thank you for the call, Mark.
[02:45:23.231 --> 02:45:24.091]  Chris in Kentucky.
[02:45:24.131 --> 02:45:24.731]  Chris, go ahead.
[02:45:24.751 --> 02:45:25.351]  You're on the air.
[02:45:25.931 --> 02:45:26.772]  Yes, thanks, Alex.
[02:45:26.872 --> 02:45:27.812]  And thank you, Matthew.
[02:45:28.112 --> 02:45:28.372]  Thank you.
[02:45:29.230 --> 02:45:30.750]  You know, you're a great American.
[02:45:30.770 --> 02:45:32.071]  We need to get more information out.
[02:45:32.191 --> 02:45:33.651]  You know, I have news clips.
[02:45:34.131 --> 02:45:39.132]  Before the planes impact, there were even news reporters had witnessed there were no windows on those planes.
[02:45:40.092 --> 02:45:43.873]  And there was also a pod that was attached under the second tower that was hit.
[02:45:43.893 --> 02:45:47.214]  And it was, I saw that in a film, 9-11 in plain sight.
[02:45:48.294 --> 02:45:52.054]  There's a lot of, you know, obvious things that are going on.
[02:45:52.335 --> 02:45:54.715]  Some people say that there was a holograph around a missile.
[02:45:55.444 --> 02:45:55.564]  Yeah.
[02:45:55.684 --> 02:45:56.885]  And that that went through.
[02:45:57.185 --> 02:46:01.006]  And, you know... Look, regardless, we know the official story is a fraud.
[02:46:01.126 --> 02:46:01.847]  It was a fraud.
[02:46:02.087 --> 02:46:02.347]  Yeah.
[02:46:02.607 --> 02:46:03.467]  It really was.
[02:46:03.507 --> 02:46:06.989]  Whether it was laser-guided missiles, or... It doesn't matter.
[02:46:07.029 --> 02:46:15.092]  But if you remember in the, um... that show that they have with most of the people from the X-Files, the computer... The Lone Gunman.
[02:46:15.412 --> 02:46:16.352]  Yes, thank you very much.
[02:46:16.372 --> 02:46:17.072]  The Lone Gunman.
[02:46:17.853 --> 02:46:23.415]  The man said in the movie, I don't want anything to do with this.
[02:46:24.142 --> 02:46:26.564]  I'm afraid and I'm going to back out.
[02:46:27.805 --> 02:46:28.866]  That's what they're doing.
[02:46:28.926 --> 02:46:30.587]  They are scaring us to death.
[02:46:30.947 --> 02:46:32.589]  They're putting us in such fear.
[02:46:32.609 --> 02:46:43.397]  For those who don't know about the Lone Gunman, months before 9-11, a secret government group, by remote control, hijacks a passenger jet and flies it into the towers for a police state.
[02:46:44.518 --> 02:46:45.999]  And again, it's all part of this flaunting.
[02:46:46.039 --> 02:46:46.700]  Anything else, Chris?
[02:46:47.256 --> 02:46:51.359]  Yeah, and I just want to give a big salute to you again, and it's just like the Pentagon.
[02:46:51.419 --> 02:46:51.979]  No wreckage.
[02:46:52.039 --> 02:46:54.361]  So this is obviously a government setup.
[02:46:54.781 --> 02:46:55.902]  All right, thank you for the call.
[02:46:56.302 --> 02:46:57.262]  Richard in Alabama.
[02:46:57.302 --> 02:46:58.183]  Richard, you're on the air.
[02:46:58.243 --> 02:46:58.683]  Go ahead.
[02:46:58.703 --> 02:46:59.464]  Hi.
[02:47:00.865 --> 02:47:07.389]  Could you tell us, in percentages, what happened to the careers of the New York firefighters?
[02:47:07.429 --> 02:47:10.451]  Like, what percentage had to quit?
[02:47:10.611 --> 02:47:12.172]  What percentage were fired?
[02:47:13.008 --> 02:47:18.930]  Unfortunately, I do not know those figures, but I can tell you something, and it may sound like I'm taking a smart aleck way, but I'm not.
[02:47:20.430 --> 02:47:26.132]  100% of those who cooperated, their careers went sky high.
[02:47:26.452 --> 02:47:29.413]  100% of those who did not cooperate have nothing but problems.
[02:47:30.333 --> 02:47:33.374]  And I know, like I said, it sounds a little slippery, but it's the truth.
[02:47:34.795 --> 02:47:41.757]  The people who cooperated, they succeeded, but some 50% of the people who were there are dying or sick.
[02:47:43.121 --> 02:47:43.541]  Oh, man.
[02:47:44.181 --> 02:47:45.442]  And there's a lot of good people.
[02:47:45.462 --> 02:47:47.722]  A lot of good people that are out there.
[02:47:49.143 --> 02:47:56.205]  You know, I have to tell you, when the first dog died there, it was a hard day for a lot of people.
[02:47:56.505 --> 02:47:58.445]  Oh, you mean dogs were dying on the spot?
[02:47:58.485 --> 02:47:59.185]  That's right.
[02:47:59.225 --> 02:48:01.886]  There was a dog, I believe it was the eighth day that the dog died.
[02:48:02.906 --> 02:48:05.887]  And I just cannot think of Jim's dog's name.
[02:48:05.967 --> 02:48:08.088]  And I do believe his name is Jim, who was the handler.
[02:48:08.528 --> 02:48:09.788]  And he was a great guy.
[02:48:09.848 --> 02:48:12.189]  He would let you pet his dog.
[02:48:13.199 --> 02:48:14.300]  I'm a handler myself.
[02:48:14.360 --> 02:48:19.484]  I have a dog who lives with me, and she's done her job, you know, until she couldn't anymore.
[02:48:20.324 --> 02:48:22.386]  And, um, they're very therapeutic.
[02:48:23.666 --> 02:48:26.508]  Alright, Richard, any other questions?
[02:48:27.809 --> 02:48:29.330]  Write a book and make a video.
[02:48:29.430 --> 02:48:29.771]  Hurry.
[02:48:30.331 --> 02:48:31.112]  I'm working on it.
[02:48:31.352 --> 02:48:35.214]  Alright, we'll be back and talk to Harvey and a few others in the final segment.
[02:48:36.275 --> 02:48:37.716]  Amazing interview.
[02:48:37.856 --> 02:48:38.777]  Stay with us, Matthew.
[02:48:38.817 --> 02:48:40.238]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[02:48:40.318 --> 02:48:40.958]  PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:48:50.383 --> 02:48:54.807]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:54.947 --> 02:48:59.330]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.370 --> 02:49:00.712]  The New World Order.
[02:49:01.472 --> 02:49:02.433]  Panama.
[02:49:02.493 --> 02:49:06.716]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.776 --> 02:49:13.722]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.842 --> 02:49:15.924]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.224 --> 02:49:26.532]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:26.832 --> 02:49:32.238]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police Take 3, is for you!

[02:50:04.370 --> 02:50:09.594]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:50:09.935 --> 02:50:20.383]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.

[02:51:54.532 --> 02:51:57.814]  Yes, hello Alex and Sergeant Matthew.
[02:51:57.834 --> 02:51:57.974]  Hello.
[02:51:57.994 --> 02:51:58.354]  I'd like to
[02:52:23.973 --> 02:52:27.795]  Tell you, it wasn't just the asbestos in the towers.
[02:52:27.955 --> 02:52:28.616]  No, not at all.
[02:52:28.856 --> 02:52:36.801]  There were so many cathode ray tubes hooked up to the computers there that the toxic mercury and the heavy metals is what you were breathing.
[02:52:37.301 --> 02:52:38.662]  Let me tell you a personal story.
[02:52:38.702 --> 02:52:39.763]  I'll make it very quick.
[02:52:40.303 --> 02:52:45.306]  My daughter Melissa was about 30 years old, was pregnant, and she was about 20 blocks away.
[02:52:45.867 --> 02:52:47.428]  Within several weeks after the 9-11,
[02:52:49.625 --> 02:52:50.106]  Happening.
[02:52:50.126 --> 02:52:51.047]  Let me put it that way.
[02:52:51.107 --> 02:52:52.790]  She was in the subway on her way to work.
[02:52:52.850 --> 02:52:53.451]  Miscarriage.
[02:52:53.871 --> 02:52:55.554]  A spontaneous miscarriage.
[02:52:55.614 --> 02:52:56.235]  That's correct.
[02:52:56.335 --> 02:53:00.301]  And she's the most healthy, most natural, doesn't smoke, doesn't drink.
[02:53:00.925 --> 02:53:02.345]  Most perfect human being ever.
[02:53:02.365 --> 02:53:03.486]  What a horrible tragedy.
[02:53:03.506 --> 02:53:04.386]  I'm sorry to hear that.
[02:53:04.486 --> 02:53:05.866]  I am very sorry for your loss.
[02:53:06.066 --> 02:53:07.807]  This global is just dealing death.
[02:53:07.947 --> 02:53:10.108]  Look at the Terry Schiavo case.
[02:53:10.168 --> 02:53:12.268]  Everywhere they go, it's just death, death, death.
[02:53:12.908 --> 02:53:13.689]  Anything else, Harvey?
[02:53:13.869 --> 02:53:14.469]  Yes.
[02:53:15.089 --> 02:53:21.431]  The EPA, the lady resigned because she was told to say how healthy the air was there in New York.
[02:53:21.491 --> 02:53:29.613]  Now, just let me also say that I also have a personal friend, a neighbor of mine, that was a consultant, that is a consultant to Deutsche Bank.
[02:53:30.530 --> 02:53:32.712]  He was in the Trade Center area there.
[02:53:32.732 --> 02:53:34.273]  I believe maybe even in Building 7.
[02:53:34.373 --> 02:53:35.674]  Yeah, Deutsche Bank.
[02:53:36.254 --> 02:53:36.874]  Deutsche Bank.
[02:53:37.014 --> 02:53:41.838]  And when I started asking him about what he was doing there, he told me he was sworn to secrecy.
[02:53:42.158 --> 02:53:42.618]  And he was.
[02:53:43.719 --> 02:53:48.342]  It's actually like what you hear about the Masonic rituals and whatnot like that.
[02:53:49.543 --> 02:53:52.585]  When you are accepted into these societies,
[02:53:53.802 --> 02:54:01.189]  It's a circle within a circle within a circle within a circle within a circle, and you are on a need-to-know basis.
[02:54:01.249 --> 02:54:02.610]  It's all compartmentalized.
[02:54:02.650 --> 02:54:03.331]  Gotta go quick.
[02:54:03.371 --> 02:54:03.911]  Thanks, Harvey.
[02:54:04.212 --> 02:54:05.693]  Mike in Illinois, then Mike in Arizona.
[02:54:05.733 --> 02:54:06.313]  Mike, go ahead.
[02:54:06.514 --> 02:54:07.935]  Yeah, Alex, listen, great show.
[02:54:07.975 --> 02:54:11.618]  Great to have you on there, and I just want to ask you both a question here.
[02:54:12.219 --> 02:54:20.466]  Alex, when the World Trade Center went down, a friend of mine, his brother lived in Manhattan, and he was about maybe, I don't know, five or six blocks
[02:54:21.238 --> 02:54:32.049]  And he said when the, after, between the first and second tower, when it came down, he said the local news there had said, at that point, they had not even known about a second aircraft that hit the tower.
[02:54:33.571 --> 02:54:37.235]  They were just totally, he said that they were brainwashing the people, the local news.
[02:54:37.904 --> 02:54:45.786]  knew that there was a plane that hit, but yet the other reporters and stuff that do the traffic in the morning, they're still saying, we don't know what caused, we don't know what happened to the tower.
[02:54:45.806 --> 02:54:47.086]  Well, it gets worse than that.
[02:54:47.186 --> 02:54:50.547]  We know that Building 7 ran the command and control for the whole complex.
[02:54:50.967 --> 02:55:01.110]  Somebody was on the radio, even after they had evacuated, the firefighters were evacuating, and they were sitting there saying, stay at your desk, stay at your desk.
[02:55:01.150 --> 02:55:02.030]  Thanks for the call, Mike.
[02:55:02.270 --> 02:55:03.331]  Did you hear about that?
[02:55:03.411 --> 02:55:03.711]  Yes.
[02:55:04.731 --> 02:55:05.151]  Yes, I did.
[02:55:05.512 --> 02:55:07.112]  So who was saying stay at your desk?
[02:55:07.533 --> 02:55:14.356]  I personally think that the people who were being encouraged to stay at their desks were not so cooperative, if you know what I mean.
[02:55:15.056 --> 02:55:16.917]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Arizona.
[02:55:16.957 --> 02:55:17.658]  Mike, go ahead.
[02:55:17.678 --> 02:55:21.200]  Matthew, you mentioned the possibility of tactical nukes early on.
[02:55:21.860 --> 02:55:25.182]  Was anyone measuring radioactivity at the ground site there?
[02:55:25.222 --> 02:55:31.805]  To my knowledge, in a very short period of time, there is going to be a book that's coming out that will explain some other things.
[02:55:32.623 --> 02:55:36.330]  And yes, there is somebody working on it that I am aware of.
[02:55:38.073 --> 02:55:39.476]  So were there devices there?
[02:55:39.496 --> 02:55:41.339]  It is my belief that that is yes.
[02:55:42.361 --> 02:55:43.222]  Completely yes.
[02:55:43.643 --> 02:55:43.944]  Thank you.
[02:55:44.930 --> 02:55:45.750]  Anything else, Mike?
[02:55:46.011 --> 02:55:46.291]  No, sir.
[02:55:46.311 --> 02:55:47.511]  All right, thanks for the call.
[02:55:47.571 --> 02:55:47.972]  Thank you.
[02:55:48.372 --> 02:55:52.714]  All right, well, Sergeant, we really... Alex, can I just tell you, I want to throw something at you real quick.
[02:55:52.734 --> 02:55:56.036]  I just got an instant message, and it's so small that I just want to share it with you.
[02:55:56.056 --> 02:55:57.396]  Yeah, we got about 30 seconds.
[02:55:57.476 --> 02:56:00.418]  Okay, it says, Chaplain, I've been through an awful, challenging life.
[02:56:00.438 --> 02:56:02.059]  I'm brokenhearted, as I've held the dream.
[02:56:02.419 --> 02:56:05.961]  But if I kept plugging away and persevered, one day I'd be dealt with.
[02:56:06.961 --> 02:56:09.763]  All I dealt with would have been work, the effort, and the anguish.
[02:56:09.823 --> 02:56:11.263]  Now, what's the deal?
[02:56:11.343 --> 02:56:12.344]  My house isn't my own.
[02:56:12.404 --> 02:56:13.384]  My car, not my own.
[02:56:13.444 --> 02:56:14.425]  My words, not my own.
[02:56:15.040 --> 02:56:18.844]  My opinion is my own, and that's about all I'm allowed to keep to myself.
[02:56:19.044 --> 02:56:20.806]  Thank you for your interview with Alex and Saeed.
[02:56:22.227 --> 02:56:26.912]  Alright, well, good having you on, and we'll try to have you back on, and we're flat out of time.
[02:56:26.972 --> 02:56:27.513]  God bless.
[02:56:27.613 --> 02:56:27.973]  Thank you.
[02:56:28.253 --> 02:56:29.014]  Alright, that's it.
[02:56:29.114 --> 02:56:29.995]  That's all she wrote.
[02:56:30.055 --> 02:56:31.136]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:31.176 --> 02:56:32.177]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:32.497 --> 02:56:33.378]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:56:33.418 --> 02:56:33.839]  God bless.
