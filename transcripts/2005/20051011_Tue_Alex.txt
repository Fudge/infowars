[00:00:05.496 --> 00:00:06.156]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.796 --> 00:00:07.877]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.577 --> 00:00:09.677]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.338 --> 00:00:11.158]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.898 --> 00:00:12.759]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:17.440]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.742]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.143 --> 00:00:40.203]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:40.243 --> 00:00:46.926]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Tuesday, the 11th day of October 2005 edition.
[00:00:46.986 --> 00:00:48.187]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:48.607 --> 00:00:51.489]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:54.050]  Coming up, total emergency alert.
[00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.691]  Hate bill will pass Senate Judiciary.
[00:00:57.492 --> 00:01:01.534]  Fight in Senate is our only hope for survival of free speech.
[00:01:02.631 --> 00:01:05.574]  And now they're reporting it has passed the judiciary.
[00:01:06.715 --> 00:01:08.396]  You didn't think the Supreme Court would rule?
[00:01:08.416 --> 00:01:09.737]  You didn't own private property?
[00:01:09.757 --> 00:01:11.939]  You didn't think they'd pass a national ID card?
[00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:16.523]  You didn't think that they'd have public officials out promoting that we all take microchips?
[00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:18.865]  You didn't think they'd confiscate guns?
[00:01:19.626 --> 00:01:22.588]  Well they are and they will and that's their plan.
[00:01:23.589 --> 00:01:25.290]  They want power, they want it now.
[00:01:25.831 --> 00:01:27.492]  Quake toll could reach 35,000 people
[00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:34.002]  And a report here out of Des Moines Register, this should be simple.
[00:01:34.022 --> 00:01:34.562]  The U.S.
[00:01:34.662 --> 00:01:39.383]  doesn't okay torture, adopt language making that clear to the world.
[00:01:39.443 --> 00:01:42.324]  But President Bush will not do it.
[00:01:42.404 --> 00:01:48.085]  But he'll send people to prison who followed his orders to torture.
[00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:54.447]  This is amazing double think and triple quadruple standards right in front of us.
[00:01:55.131 --> 00:01:56.031]  Another report here.
[00:01:56.091 --> 00:01:57.552]  Prison guards enjoy torture.
[00:01:57.572 --> 00:01:58.452]  They're quite proud of it.
[00:01:58.472 --> 00:01:59.392]  We'll get into that report.
[00:01:59.692 --> 00:02:07.174]  Again, they hire these federal prison guards who have bad records, who've already had complaints filed on them, and then they get to have their way.
[00:02:08.075 --> 00:02:14.036]  In fact, calling all Ted Bundys, don't be dumb and just go out, you know, killing and slaughtering on the highways of America.
[00:02:14.617 --> 00:02:16.097]  Join the Army of One!
[00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:20.058]  You can be the, you know, big fat goblin in the sky.
[00:02:20.098 --> 00:02:23.099]  You can go to Iraq and enjoy yourselves.
[00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.751]  Victims of police beating says he was sober.
[00:02:27.251 --> 00:02:30.873]  Retired teacher, 64, struck by New Orleans police officers.
[00:02:32.494 --> 00:02:34.855]  And they beat the pulp out of this guy.
[00:02:34.875 --> 00:02:37.176]  And I've seen different newscasts, heard different newscasts.
[00:02:38.936 --> 00:02:49.661]  To me it's an illustration not just of police brutality and out of control government, but how it's right in your face and the media still spins it as if he was resisting.
[00:02:51.363 --> 00:02:53.844]  They're beating him and he's pulling away.
[00:02:53.884 --> 00:02:57.506]  He doesn't resist until they start pounding him in the head.
[00:02:58.066 --> 00:03:00.368]  I mean, that's an automatic response.
[00:03:00.888 --> 00:03:03.509]  And I've seen this over and over again from surveillance tapes.
[00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:05.130]  I mean, I've been in court hearings.
[00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.533]  They're supporting people I know who've been beat up by cops and they'll even show the video to the jury and the jury will still convict them.
[00:03:12.374 --> 00:03:13.894]  The cop slams you in the ground.
[00:03:13.934 --> 00:03:14.875]  You cover your head up.
[00:03:14.895 --> 00:03:15.775]  You push away.
[00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:17.476]  They slam you into the car.
[00:03:17.556 --> 00:03:19.057]  You buck backwards.
[00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.025]  I mean, I guarantee you Nazi death camps, when they hit somebody with a belly club, they put their hands up.
[00:03:25.466 --> 00:03:26.247]  How dare you!
[00:03:26.267 --> 00:03:28.149]  I'm going to beat you even more now!
[00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:33.194]  Folks, you have to lay there like a jellyfish.
[00:03:33.695 --> 00:03:35.216]  With total focus.
[00:03:35.737 --> 00:03:37.459]  Not moving while they beat you.
[00:03:38.544 --> 00:03:51.811]  And a lot of times now there won't be footage of it, and they'll just claim you attacked them, because by throwing that charge on you, and cops all know this, by throwing that false charge on you now, they put it all on you so they don't get in trouble.
[00:03:52.251 --> 00:04:04.917]  You know, they're on too many steroids, their wife's fighting with them, they've drunk too much coffee, you know, whatever, they're irritable, they beat the living tar out of you, and then not only do you get beat up,
[00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:12.297]  You get charges and may spend a couple years in jail, or for sure you're going to lose your Second Amendment rights and get on probation.
[00:04:13.338 --> 00:04:13.798]  And you know what?
[00:04:13.838 --> 00:04:18.521]  I'm sick of the cops and the government going, you're all guilty, I don't want to hear you're innocent.
[00:04:18.702 --> 00:04:19.943]  That's what they all say.
[00:04:20.123 --> 00:04:20.783]  Well, you know what?
[00:04:21.183 --> 00:04:23.285]  I'm not going to say there's just a few bad apples anymore.
[00:04:23.325 --> 00:04:23.745]  You know what?
[00:04:24.306 --> 00:04:24.726]  You know what?
[00:04:24.746 --> 00:04:24.946]  Uh-uh.
[00:04:25.187 --> 00:04:26.147]  That's what they all say.
[00:04:26.247 --> 00:04:27.228]  You're all evil.
[00:04:27.548 --> 00:04:29.049]  You're all, ooh, you don't like that.
[00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:30.170]  It's not fair, is it?
[00:04:30.511 --> 00:04:31.191]  I don't care.
[00:04:31.611 --> 00:04:32.552]  You're all evil.
[00:04:32.592 --> 00:04:33.693]  You're all drug dealers.
[00:04:33.713 --> 00:04:34.814]  You're all running whores.
[00:04:35.737 --> 00:04:37.077]  You're all corrupt.
[00:04:37.358 --> 00:04:37.718]  All of you.
[00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:38.978]  Every cop in America.
[00:04:39.638 --> 00:04:40.699]  Now, that's not true.
[00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:44.860]  But it's what you say about us, so... So, hey, public servants.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.321]  I'm gonna start saying you're all criminals.
[00:04:47.581 --> 00:04:52.343]  Because statistically, you do have a higher rate of criminality than the general public.
[00:04:52.403 --> 00:04:53.603]  Oh, you didn't know those statistics?
[00:04:54.343 --> 00:04:55.584]  That's the federal statistics.
[00:04:56.044 --> 00:05:00.445]  So, you're all bank robbers.
[00:05:02.086 --> 00:05:03.746]  What really happened September 11th?
[00:05:03.887 --> 00:05:04.967]  And who stands to gain?
[00:05:05.666 --> 00:05:06.966]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:05:07.166 --> 00:05:12.908]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:05:13.188 --> 00:05:18.429]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:22.870]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.831]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[00:05:27.091 --> 00:05:31.652]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:05:31.792 --> 00:05:38.056]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:05:38.116 --> 00:05:39.997]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[00:05:58.168 --> 00:06:00.209]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:06:01.312 --> 00:06:09.938]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:06:10.158 --> 00:06:21.446]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:06:21.646 --> 00:06:24.308]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:24.648 --> 00:06:28.751]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[00:06:28.951 --> 00:06:31.093]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:06:31.254 --> 00:06:33.136]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:06:33.316 --> 00:06:39.343]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:06:39.603 --> 00:06:45.270]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:08.494]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.094 --> 00:08:12.137]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.299 --> 00:08:19.963]  Alright, second segment, 8 minutes, 17 seconds into this first hour.
[00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:22.485]  It is Tuesday, the 11th day of October 2005.
[00:08:22.525 --> 00:08:28.930]  I want to thank the huge crowd, the overflow crowd, that came out to the Alamo Draft House Cinema.
[00:08:29.998 --> 00:08:33.759]  Last night, to see my new documentary, The Order of Death.
[00:08:34.439 --> 00:08:37.580]  And it's about 43 minutes long.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:43.282]  And then, of course, you got to see the original Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:08:43.302 --> 00:08:47.523]  Well, by original, it's been cut down from over two hours to about an hour and 45 minutes.
[00:08:48.303 --> 00:08:48.864]  And you know what?
[00:08:48.944 --> 00:08:49.644]  I'm not done.
[00:08:49.664 --> 00:08:53.825]  I'm going to go back into the studio and I'm going to add a few more minutes to The Order of Death.
[00:08:54.443 --> 00:09:05.452]  Then I'm going to cut a few more minutes out of Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove and then next week it's going to go off to the DVD duplicators and we'll have that for you in a few weeks.
[00:09:05.512 --> 00:09:18.743]  But if you want to get the original Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, it's only on VHS and it's got the extra 20 minutes of video that has now been cut out of it, if you want those original clips, then
[00:09:19.918 --> 00:09:24.200]  You can certainly go to Infowars.com and order Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:30.882]  And every Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, every original that we ship out, the next few weeks will be personally signed.
[00:09:30.902 --> 00:09:32.382]  I know some folks want that.
[00:09:32.442 --> 00:09:43.426]  Plus, that'll make it a collector's edition, just because it'll have the signature and that'll note that it is the final run of the original Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:09:43.846 --> 00:09:47.688]  We're also carrying Jim Tucker's new book, Bilderberg Diary,
[00:09:48.448 --> 00:09:49.809]  And I finished reading it.
[00:09:49.909 --> 00:09:51.189]  It is an excellent book.
[00:09:51.869 --> 00:09:59.392]  And it covers his 27, 28 years of covering the Bilderberg group, of sneaking in, of his inside sources.
[00:09:59.872 --> 00:10:03.353]  It's a real inside look of the global government, at the global government.
[00:10:03.654 --> 00:10:09.296]  Be sure and go to infowars.com and secure your copy of Jim Tucker's Bilderberg diary.
[00:10:09.596 --> 00:10:12.837]  It also serves kind of as a memoir as well.
[00:10:14.142 --> 00:10:20.685]  It doesn't say that on the insert of the book, but I asked Jim that off air, and he said, yes, it is somewhat of a memoir, so it's important to get Jim Tucker's memoir.
[00:10:21.626 --> 00:10:24.487]  Alright, let's jump into the news.
[00:10:24.627 --> 00:10:26.628]  Total Emergency Alert!
[00:10:27.608 --> 00:10:29.669]  Hate Bill will pass Senate Judiciary.
[00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.331]  And now it's going to the full Senate.
[00:10:34.151 --> 00:10:37.373]  Fight in Senate is our only hope for the survival of free speech.
[00:10:38.709 --> 00:10:40.672]  I'll tell Pastor Pike this, he's done a great job.
[00:10:40.732 --> 00:10:44.697]  You know what, they can say I don't have free speech all day long, they can't arrest all of us.
[00:10:46.499 --> 00:10:53.968]  And yes, under the EU rules that our government's going to follow, criticizing the EU, criticizing world government, you can be arrested.
[00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:56.291]  Let them try it!
[00:10:57.735 --> 00:11:00.096]  I mean, you know, let them try to say there's no private property.
[00:11:00.136 --> 00:11:01.637]  Let them try to say there's no freedom.
[00:11:01.657 --> 00:11:03.578]  Let them try to say we've all got to be on drugs.
[00:11:04.118 --> 00:11:06.880]  You know, let them try to say that none of us have any due process.
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.741]  It's just not true and it's a fraud.
[00:11:10.602 --> 00:11:13.083]  And the people are not going to put up with it, but we are trying to defeat it.
[00:11:13.143 --> 00:11:21.427]  But, you know, look, they can pass a law saying I've got to report to a plantation and put a chain around my neck and pull a plow.
[00:11:22.228 --> 00:11:23.048]  I'm not going to do it.
[00:11:24.039 --> 00:11:30.788]  And if the government gets so unlawful and so openly criminal that it comes and says that I am their slave, it's no longer my government.
[00:11:30.828 --> 00:11:34.533]  The Declaration of Independence tells us, commands us, what to do.
[00:11:34.993 --> 00:11:36.595]  And that is physically resistant.
[00:11:37.216 --> 00:11:38.858]  And by the way, that's not a radical statement.
[00:11:39.399 --> 00:11:42.283]  If the government says, you know my favorite analogy,
[00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:58.656]  The Supreme Court ruled two separate times that black people are not human beings, that they could be killed, tortured, hung, that they could have their feet chopped off, their toes chopped off if they tried to run, that they were not human, that they were owned by the plantation owner.
[00:11:59.556 --> 00:12:02.757]  Now you can ask yourself, because it was the law, were they human beings?
[00:12:02.837 --> 00:12:06.899]  Of course they were human beings, and of course that law was a fraud.
[00:12:08.237 --> 00:12:13.299]  It was the law that if a Druid priest wanted your child to throw them into a fiery pit, that it happened.
[00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:21.002]  It was the law that if the Aztecs wanted your child, or your wife, or you, you went with them.
[00:12:22.042 --> 00:12:26.564]  Now, it was the law that if you criticized the Roman government, they would crucify you.
[00:12:27.344 --> 00:12:28.665]  Look, it's all a fraud.
[00:12:28.705 --> 00:12:31.886]  We have innate, God-given human rights.
[00:12:33.026 --> 00:12:35.067]  Innate, God-given rights.
[00:12:35.805 --> 00:12:42.370]  That if somebody's beating you over the head with an axe handle for no reason, you have a right, you have a duty to jerk it away and beat their brains out.
[00:12:43.511 --> 00:12:45.573]  I mean, it's really that simple.
[00:12:46.494 --> 00:12:49.857]  And so, government can announce we're their slaves all day long.
[00:12:50.017 --> 00:12:51.598]  It isn't true.
[00:12:52.779 --> 00:12:58.263]  In the last segment, I talked about how the police treat us all as if we're guilty.
[00:12:59.124 --> 00:13:00.165]  Ah, you're all guilty.
[00:13:00.625 --> 00:13:02.167]  Oh, that's it, you know, well no, I'm innocent.
[00:13:02.267 --> 00:13:03.728]  Oh, everybody says they're innocent.
[00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:11.534]  And major studies and statistics show about 10% of the people on death row are innocent.
[00:13:11.554 --> 00:13:11.534]  10%!
[00:13:11.594 --> 00:13:13.375]  See, I'm for the death penalty.
[00:13:14.536 --> 00:13:18.659]  But only in extreme cases where it's caught red-handed in triplicate.
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:22.161]  And because this government is so corrupt,
[00:13:22.899 --> 00:13:23.899]  I'm not for the death penalty.
[00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.440]  Again, I am for an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:35.323]  I am for, you know, executing somebody who kidnaps a child and kills them, or somebody who goes into a nursing home and butchers five old ladies, whatever.
[00:13:35.643 --> 00:13:38.044]  You know, that's the proper thing to get rid of these animals.
[00:13:39.924 --> 00:13:51.288]  But when you've got a government that is so much more corrupt than any individual serial killer you can imagine, it is better that ten guilty men go free than one man who's innocent go to prison.
[00:13:52.185 --> 00:13:54.666]  Now, that's what the Founding Fathers and many other statesmen said.
[00:13:55.006 --> 00:13:56.147]  It's common sense.
[00:13:56.747 --> 00:13:59.108]  And believe me, a lot of innocent people are going to prison.
[00:13:59.808 --> 00:14:03.170]  Or, people are going to prison for long stints when it doesn't fit the crime.
[00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:07.992]  You go, wait a minute, I always hear about, you know, somebody who kills someone and they only spend five years in prison.
[00:14:08.352 --> 00:14:11.234]  Well, yeah, that's about the national average with 4.7 years.
[00:14:11.874 --> 00:14:12.474]  Exactly!
[00:14:12.894 --> 00:14:20.718]  Some long-haired, peaceful pot dealer is going to spend on average, what, eight, nine years in prison because he's a good little worker building widgets.
[00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:26.014]  But the violent killer will spend no more than five years on average.
[00:14:27.095 --> 00:14:28.977]  Unless he kills a cop, then he'll be executed.
[00:14:28.997 --> 00:14:37.386]  It's a 95% apprehension, indictment, conviction rate.
[00:14:38.087 --> 00:14:42.732]  By the way, when you or I get killed, it's only a 10% apprehension and conviction rate.
[00:14:43.452 --> 00:14:43.973]  Why is that?
[00:14:44.659 --> 00:14:53.021]  Did you know you'll spend more time in prison for hitting a police dog than you will for committing a murder on average in this country?
[00:14:53.281 --> 00:14:56.042]  Their dogs are better than us.
[00:14:56.702 --> 00:15:03.243]  From Newcastle, PA to Lansing, Michigan, people are spending upwards of 20 years in prison.
[00:15:03.523 --> 00:15:11.905]  They're getting 40 year sentences and on average they'll spend about 20 years in prison, the statistics show, for striking God dogs.
[00:15:13.576 --> 00:15:16.017]  Something is wrong with this picture.
[00:15:16.157 --> 00:15:19.078]  Something is malfunctioning.
[00:15:20.258 --> 00:15:26.940]  So I sarcastically said before I start getting emails, that okay, that I consider all police murderers, killers, you name it.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:32.161]  Because if we're all murderers and killers, and bank robbers, well then you are.
[00:15:32.241 --> 00:15:41.344]  Because statistically, more alcoholism, more drug abuse, more family violence, more suicide, more manslaughter, more murder,
[00:15:42.575 --> 00:15:45.917]  More drug dealing, narcotics trafficking in police.
[00:15:46.658 --> 00:15:52.902]  What group has the highest statistic in the United States for crime?
[00:15:54.704 --> 00:15:55.965]  State and federal statistics.
[00:15:57.386 --> 00:15:58.186]  Police!
[00:16:00.048 --> 00:16:04.931]  Now still, it's the minority of them, but they are numero uno, and cops all know this.
[00:16:05.111 --> 00:16:06.292]  This is not a hidden statistic.
[00:16:06.752 --> 00:16:07.693]  Though it's not trumpeted.
[00:16:09.068 --> 00:16:09.728]  Why is that?
[00:16:09.768 --> 00:16:12.789]  Because when you dance with the devil, the devil doesn't change, he changes you.
[00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:17.870]  And that old cliché rings true.
[00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:20.491]  Because they're there for years.
[00:16:20.811 --> 00:16:21.411]  They see it.
[00:16:21.811 --> 00:16:23.091]  They get offered deals.
[00:16:23.431 --> 00:16:25.052]  Other corrupt cops bring them in.
[00:16:25.532 --> 00:16:30.233]  My point is, is that I don't want to hear it from you cops anymore.
[00:16:30.293 --> 00:16:31.453]  That, oh, you're all guilty.
[00:16:31.553 --> 00:16:32.814]  Oh, you all got something to hide.
[00:16:32.854 --> 00:16:33.634]  You're all bad.
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:41.285]  And you know, so many innocent people that are in prison, and the cops and the jail guards tell them, that's what everybody says!
[00:16:41.686 --> 00:16:42.646]  Well then, you know what?
[00:16:42.686 --> 00:16:45.128]  You want to shoot your mouths off and call us all criminals?
[00:16:45.749 --> 00:16:46.930]  Well, if the shoe fits, wear it.
[00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:50.012]  If you really believe that bull, then you better look in the mirror.
[00:16:50.052 --> 00:16:53.755]  Because if anybody, if the shoe fits anybody, Mac, it's you.
[00:16:55.936 --> 00:16:57.698]  And obviously, it's not true.
[00:16:57.738 --> 00:16:58.719]  You're not all criminals.
[00:16:59.959 --> 00:17:00.400]  Obviously.
[00:17:01.016 --> 00:17:06.199]  The minority of you are criminals, but it's the biggest minority out there of any substrate of society.
[00:17:06.939 --> 00:17:07.740]  And you know it.
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.540]  You've read the numbers.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.401]  Nobody knows the numbers better than cops.
[00:17:10.782 --> 00:17:12.423]  So just stop shooting your mouths off.
[00:17:13.363 --> 00:17:14.444]  I'm tired of this attitude.
[00:17:14.464 --> 00:17:16.685]  This is not Napoleonic France, folks.
[00:17:16.705 --> 00:17:18.526]  We're innocent until proven guilty.
[00:17:20.003 --> 00:17:29.129]  Here's a clip of them whitewashing, beating up the old black man for no reason, and then charging him with assaulting him when the video shows he didn't do it.
[00:17:29.409 --> 00:17:32.932]  I mean, look, if somebody's punching you in the face, I'd expect you to retreat.
[00:17:33.532 --> 00:17:35.233]  Try to put your hands up to fall back.
[00:17:36.314 --> 00:17:46.561]  I mean, if we can't defend ourselves from you goons, then we certainly should be able to cover ourselves and ball up like little babies like he tried.
[00:17:47.119 --> 00:17:52.720]  But, boy, they beat him into a bloody, sopping mess with, I mean, just streams of blood pouring.
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:58.581]  I mean, they smashed his nose, smashed in his eyes, smashed in his mouth, jumped all over him.
[00:18:00.481 --> 00:18:01.562]  We're human beings.
[00:18:01.642 --> 00:18:03.042]  We don't deserve this.
[00:18:03.422 --> 00:18:08.583]  Just because you're on steroids and want to beat somebody up, go, go, go take a boxing class.
[00:18:08.603 --> 00:18:13.284]  Go sign up downtown at the box... Oh, but you don't want to fight real fighters, do you?
[00:18:13.604 --> 00:18:14.564]  Go ahead and roll this clip.
[00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:21.072]  Three New Orleans police officers appeared in court Monday and entered pleas of not guilty to charges of battery.
[00:18:21.452 --> 00:18:30.175]  The charges stem from a videotape incident over the weekend in which two patrolmen repeatedly punched a 64-year-old man who was accused of public intoxication.
[00:18:30.535 --> 00:18:38.757]  The Associated Press television news tape shows an officer hitting Robert Davis at least four times in the head Saturday night outside a French Quarter bar.
[00:18:39.157 --> 00:18:44.419]  Davis appears to resist twisting and flailing as he is dragged to the ground by four officers.
[00:18:44.839 --> 00:18:48.481]  Another of the officers then knees Davis and punches him twice.
[00:18:49.021 --> 00:18:54.263]  Davis ends up face down on the sidewalk with blood streaming down his arm and into the gutter.
[00:18:54.623 --> 00:19:03.187]  Authorities say Davis was booked on public intoxication, resisting arrest, battery on a police officer, and public intimidation and was released Monday morning.
[00:19:03.527 --> 00:19:10.749]  The videotape also captures an officer ordering APTN producer Rich Matthews and his cameraman to stop recording.
[00:19:11.069 --> 00:19:22.112]  When Matthews holds up his credentials, the officer grabs the producer, leans him backwards over a car, jabs him in the stomach, and unleashes a profanity-laced tirade telling Matthews to go home.
[00:19:22.672 --> 00:19:28.096]  The police officers were released on bond this morning after a brief hearing and quickly left without commenting.
[00:19:28.476 --> 00:19:30.797]  All three were suspended yesterday without pay.
[00:19:31.097 --> 00:19:33.439]  The trial is set for January 11th.
[00:19:33.959 --> 00:19:35.740]  Ed Donahue, the Associated Press.
[00:19:37.221 --> 00:19:41.324]  Yeah, these New Orleans cops have been getting away with acting like a bunch of thugs for too long.
[00:19:41.404 --> 00:19:47.948]  I mean, you got AP reporters 30, 40 feet away, and these stupid cops think they can just go around beating up reporters.
[00:19:48.664 --> 00:19:50.465]  And it did happen a lot, folks.
[00:19:50.485 --> 00:19:58.449]  I mean, all over the... I've talked to so many reporters who were beat up and then had their cameras confiscated, but thank God there was another AP reporter catching it all on tape.
[00:20:02.931 --> 00:20:08.233]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:20:08.574 --> 00:20:13.856]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business in the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[00:20:14.276 --> 00:20:17.218]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[00:23:04.156 --> 00:23:07.977]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:23:08.317 --> 00:23:09.137]  Read the labels.
[00:23:09.557 --> 00:23:13.698]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:23:13.898 --> 00:23:18.100]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:23.341]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.

[00:24:23.463 --> 00:24:35.232]  The Senate, 90 to 9 last week, as you know, says, hey, the Pentagon and the military can only torture people to a certain extent.
[00:24:35.253 --> 00:24:40.217]  You can only pressure them and deny them sleep and rough them up and put them in painful positions.
[00:24:40.977 --> 00:24:43.659]  By the way, folks, making you sit on your knees with your
[00:24:44.918 --> 00:24:49.359]  With your feet up underneath your hind end is extremely painful.
[00:24:49.619 --> 00:24:50.679]  Try it for five minutes.
[00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:56.621]  Things start going to sleep, then nerve endings start firing off.
[00:24:57.661 --> 00:25:00.381]  Remember these guys do that in football for punishment.
[00:25:00.982 --> 00:25:03.582]  Hold out the two helmets to your side with them screaming at you.
[00:25:03.622 --> 00:25:07.783]  After about 30 minutes it becomes, well you know, that type of, that's bad enough.
[00:25:09.103 --> 00:25:12.124]  Okay, and chaining somebody up like that is really bad.
[00:25:13.456 --> 00:25:15.097]  I mean, you're talking massive torture.
[00:25:15.797 --> 00:25:20.119]  But no, they're driving around with people hanging by their ankles and their feet from forklifts.
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.280]  They're beating them to death.
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.702]  They're raping them with battery acid dripping off of the instruments.
[00:25:25.482 --> 00:25:27.143]  I mean, that's in the admitted report.
[00:25:27.183 --> 00:25:30.125]  That's in General Togumbo's own report.
[00:25:30.845 --> 00:25:31.966]  It's not like it's debatable.
[00:25:32.446 --> 00:25:35.267]  And they admitted that they were ordered to do this.
[00:25:35.287 --> 00:25:38.489]  You know, first they tried to go after General Kilpatrick.
[00:25:39.392 --> 00:25:40.833]  Which they're masters of this.
[00:25:41.333 --> 00:25:46.115]  They'll go after somebody who's innocent, so when they're found innocent, they say, see, nothing really happened.
[00:25:46.755 --> 00:25:53.879]  Well, Kilpatrick told the world, she said, wait a minute, I wasn't even allowed into these classified wings of Abu Ghraib and other areas.
[00:25:54.819 --> 00:25:58.341]  That was the CIA and private contractors.
[00:26:00.126 --> 00:26:03.948]  And they bring in the federal prison guards, you name it, and it was a house of horrors.
[00:26:04.288 --> 00:26:05.168]  And it's still going!
[00:26:05.408 --> 00:26:10.311]  They've got one of these torture chambers in every prison in Iraq, of the 32 camps.
[00:26:11.691 --> 00:26:12.892]  Same thing at Camp X-Ray.
[00:26:13.392 --> 00:26:16.653]  They have the general camp, and then they have a CIA-controlled camp.
[00:26:17.994 --> 00:26:20.495]  We always hear about the horrors in the Army camp.
[00:26:21.936 --> 00:26:22.976]  Or in the Marine Corps camp.
[00:26:23.937 --> 00:26:27.138]  But you go into the CIA camp,
[00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:31.731]  And it is very, very, very serious.
[00:26:31.811 --> 00:26:33.512]  A camp within a camp.
[00:26:33.972 --> 00:26:36.273]  That's where the torture goes on.
[00:26:37.593 --> 00:26:43.915]  And General Shoemaker, who is now the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he's the guy that ran the wet work in Waco.
[00:26:44.815 --> 00:26:45.896]  A real man, folks.
[00:26:45.936 --> 00:26:52.217]  Six-month-old babies getting blown to bits when the Delta Force put that shape charge on top of the Perch Records vault area.
[00:26:52.257 --> 00:26:53.238]  And that's all admitted.
[00:26:53.278 --> 00:26:54.398]  We have the Delta Force documents.
[00:26:54.438 --> 00:26:56.959]  They admit they went in and, quote, engaged them.
[00:26:58.007 --> 00:27:00.209]  And this is a great American.
[00:27:00.249 --> 00:27:01.670]  He can kill American babies.
[00:27:02.071 --> 00:27:03.191]  Ah, it's collateral damage.
[00:27:03.232 --> 00:27:04.633]  Yeah, you're a real man, aren't you?
[00:27:05.073 --> 00:27:06.374]  You're a real man, aren't you?
[00:27:06.955 --> 00:27:11.278]  Well, he was a big proponent of torture back when he was just a lowly colonel and then a general.
[00:27:12.159 --> 00:27:17.183]  And so we got a guy who likes to engage the public and who has engaged the American people.
[00:27:18.404 --> 00:27:19.925]  And he's tasted blood.
[00:27:19.965 --> 00:27:21.927]  I mean, this dog has sucked on children.
[00:27:21.947 --> 00:27:23.308]  It's like a pit bull.
[00:27:23.328 --> 00:27:24.089]  They feed babies.
[00:27:25.015 --> 00:27:26.495]  And he's got the taste.
[00:27:26.535 --> 00:27:26.995]  He likes it.
[00:27:27.015 --> 00:27:28.876]  He's surrounded by a bunch of psychopaths.
[00:27:29.556 --> 00:27:33.577]  I mean, there are mainstream publications reporting on Shoemaker and his occult activities.
[00:27:34.197 --> 00:27:39.518]  He's the guy that ran the Fort Bragg... Black Magic!
[00:27:39.818 --> 00:27:41.919]  I mean, it's... Again, I'm not kidding.
[00:27:41.939 --> 00:27:43.919]  Just type in Shoemaker, Black Magic into Google.
[00:27:44.739 --> 00:27:48.720]  And, uh... He just, uh... He must get along well with Bush.
[00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:50.620]  I mean, what do you expect?
[00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:53.321]  You've pretty much got to be, I guess, into Black Magic to kill babies.
[00:27:54.170 --> 00:28:00.132]  But I'm concerned, and then Bush wants to get rid of Posse Comitatus so Shoemaker can have his way with us.
[00:28:00.992 --> 00:28:02.353]  By the way folks, that's mainstream news.
[00:28:02.373 --> 00:28:05.274]  He was the head of the Pentagon's occult activities.
[00:28:06.054 --> 00:28:08.655]  You know it as remote viewing and all that, but it got deeper.
[00:28:08.715 --> 00:28:15.858]  It got into actual contact with spirits and trying to kill people and animals by focusing psychic energy on them.
[00:28:15.898 --> 00:28:19.279]  I mean, there's no other definition but pure ancient black magic.
[00:28:20.639 --> 00:28:22.340]  And they claim some success with the program.
[00:28:24.221 --> 00:28:30.243]  But even my critic, John Ronson's new book, The Men Who Stare at Goats, he's published by what, Simon & Schuster?
[00:28:31.223 --> 00:28:32.083]  He interviewed these people.
[00:28:32.123 --> 00:28:33.024]  He's got all the documents.
[00:28:33.084 --> 00:28:33.524]  It's in there.
[00:28:33.844 --> 00:28:35.805]  I have the Earth First Battalion's own manual.
[00:28:36.365 --> 00:28:50.309]  By the way, last night I had a few Wiccans and a few people, Kabbalists and others, come up to me at the end of the film and go, why were you criticizing the locals who were doing their own ritual against the Grovers?
[00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:53.830]  Well, it's pretty obvious.
[00:28:55.647 --> 00:29:03.332]  You know, this same group criticized me for talking about the occult activities in the Grove, saying, oh, it doesn't happen, or oh, so what, or you're a wacko.
[00:29:03.692 --> 00:29:14.500]  And then we go out there, and they're doing their own ritual the year after I sneak in at the gates of the Grove with the highway blocked, literally conjuring spirits and drawing circles and a witch's pot.
[00:29:16.301 --> 00:29:22.005]  I mean, they said I shouldn't talk about it, about how Bush is doing this, and then I go there and they're doing it.
[00:29:22.634 --> 00:29:23.875]  That's very newsworthy.
[00:29:23.915 --> 00:29:25.576]  That's very interesting.
[00:29:26.156 --> 00:29:32.119]  And they got real mad that I talked about how the Druids, which they hearkened back to, killed, sacrificed people.
[00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:34.381]  They got really irritated by that.
[00:29:34.421 --> 00:29:34.821]  Look, look.
[00:29:35.642 --> 00:29:36.722]  History is history.
[00:29:36.922 --> 00:29:37.943]  Facts are facts.
[00:29:38.823 --> 00:29:42.666]  And I'm telling you, the fruits of this stuff are dark and bad.
[00:29:43.886 --> 00:29:48.609]  Now, I'm not, you know, adding some witch hunt after you, but I just want you to know what you're involved in.
[00:29:51.721 --> 00:29:54.705]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.626 --> 00:29:58.309]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.153 --> 00:30:04.955]  Let's face it, we know that we're less than perfect when it comes to our diets.
[00:30:05.075 --> 00:30:10.138]  We all eat sugar, saturated fats, salt, probably don't get the exercise we should, and we all have to deal with daily stress.
[00:30:10.358 --> 00:30:16.541]  And all the vitamins and supplements in the world won't help you if your immune system is compromised because of our less than perfect eating habits and lifestyles.
[00:30:16.822 --> 00:30:22.465]  That's why Agaricus Bio is the number one dietary supplement that you should consider an absolute must if you're going to take any at all.
[00:30:22.705 --> 00:30:28.229]  The immune system is your body's first line of defense against disease, and Agaricus Bio strengthens and supports your immune system.
[00:30:28.469 --> 00:30:32.312]  That's why it's become the most popular immune support system for people and pets in Japan.
[00:30:32.332 --> 00:30:38.616]  A one-month supply of Agaricus Bio is only $34.95, and that's a small price to pay considering the alternatives.
[00:30:38.636 --> 00:30:39.737]  Call 877-817-9829.
[00:30:39.757 --> 00:30:44.460]  That's 877-817-9829, or visit ThePowerMall.com.
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:48.803]  How many times have you heard about people taking vitamin C and other vitamins and supplements to fight a cold?
[00:30:49.003 --> 00:30:51.905]  Well, with Agaricus Bio, you might not catch that cold in the first place.

[00:31:01.329 --> 00:31:07.570]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:13.871]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:14.151 --> 00:31:22.593]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:22.833 --> 00:31:29.854]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:31:30.154 --> 00:31:34.977]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:31:35.197 --> 00:31:40.601]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:31:40.941 --> 00:31:44.023]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:31:44.364 --> 00:31:52.269]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:32:01.515 --> 00:32:08.399]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[00:32:08.539 --> 00:32:21.468]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[00:32:21.648 --> 00:32:23.429]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[00:32:23.609 --> 00:32:27.072]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[00:32:27.352 --> 00:32:31.135]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[00:32:31.396 --> 00:32:36.360]  Whatever it is you seek, Zangle could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.341]  So take matters into your own hands.
[00:32:38.602 --> 00:32:42.585]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.

[00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:51.350]  Call 888-203-6633 today.
[00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:52.611]  Bring them on.
[00:32:52.891 --> 00:32:56.013]  I hear there's rumors on the internet
[00:33:11.491 --> 00:33:15.453]  Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories.
[00:33:15.613 --> 00:33:21.135]  In my line of work, you gotta keep repeating things over and over and over again.
[00:33:21.155 --> 00:33:23.156]  You gotta catapult the propaganda.
[00:33:24.336 --> 00:33:33.760]  This is like... propaganda.
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:37.101]  If this were a dictatorship, it'd be a heck of a lot easier.
[00:33:37.901 --> 00:33:39.062]  Just so long as I'm the dictator.
[00:33:41.208 --> 00:33:49.415]  You're so sick that you can't talk about it.
[00:33:49.495 --> 00:33:50.736]  Some people call you the elite.
[00:33:51.276 --> 00:33:54.999]  I call you my base.
[00:33:55.559 --> 00:33:57.100]  Behind them is a cult of evil.
[00:33:58.081 --> 00:34:03.465]  The terrorist threat to America will be diminished the moment that Saddam Hussein is decided.
[00:34:08.994 --> 00:34:13.736]  All right, George W. Bush and his new rock and roll slash hip-hop band.
[00:34:15.117 --> 00:34:16.698]  So there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:17.218 --> 00:34:19.239]  And those are not altered clips.
[00:34:19.279 --> 00:34:20.740]  I mean, those are really things he said.
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:23.581]  Of course, I think the public's figured that out by now.
[00:34:23.601 --> 00:34:26.343]  A lot of people hear these clips we play of Bush and think we've done something with them.
[00:34:26.363 --> 00:34:26.783]  We haven't.
[00:34:27.509 --> 00:34:28.789]  We just put it to music.
[00:34:28.849 --> 00:34:30.050]  Good job, John, doing that.
[00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:46.375]  We're going to talk to Keith and Gavin and Linda and Radkin and Rodney here in just a few minutes, but getting back to last night, I got some news I want to get to, but getting back to last night, you know, we showed my new film, 40-minute film, 43-minute film to be exact, Order of Death.
[00:34:47.255 --> 00:34:55.898]  Then we showed my old five-year-old documentary, which is pretty darn good in its own right, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:34:57.498 --> 00:35:05.585]  And there were a few people in the audience who thought I was making fun of the Wiccans.
[00:35:06.345 --> 00:35:10.949]  Thought I was making fun of the... I mean, you claim Wicc is something new.
[00:35:11.149 --> 00:35:11.749]  It's nothing new.
[00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:14.492]  This group was doing classical western magic.
[00:35:14.852 --> 00:35:16.833]  Conjuring spirits, sending them into the grove.
[00:35:17.254 --> 00:35:19.956]  And that's called black magic on top of it, boys and girls.
[00:35:20.576 --> 00:35:21.177]  You know, when you start
[00:35:22.119 --> 00:35:27.643]  You know, sending things and directing things and calling for power, which they were doing.
[00:35:27.703 --> 00:35:31.926]  You are in really deep trouble.
[00:35:32.466 --> 00:35:35.949]  According to... I mean, I've actually read a lot of these books and studied it.
[00:35:36.429 --> 00:35:38.911]  And I looked at it, especially since I snuck into the Grove.
[00:35:40.171 --> 00:35:42.513]  And you know, folks, I am a Christian.
[00:35:43.754 --> 00:35:48.037]  And that doesn't mean that I support these big establishment churches that in many cases are
[00:35:48.883 --> 00:35:50.424]  Totally evil and totally corrupt.
[00:35:50.525 --> 00:35:53.427]  But don't think for a minute then that that means that I'm into the occult.
[00:35:54.048 --> 00:35:57.871]  And that I think conjuring a circle and conjuring spirits is good.
[00:35:59.032 --> 00:36:01.494]  The people I know that get into that, it's very destructive.
[00:36:01.995 --> 00:36:04.197]  And I don't want to get into some big argument with people.
[00:36:04.257 --> 00:36:06.058]  Now I'm going to have everybody attacking me.
[00:36:06.098 --> 00:36:10.062]  I'm going to have the Wiccan Brigade in sending power beams at me.
[00:36:10.669 --> 00:36:13.592]  Because that's what they do, they're power-beaming the Grove.
[00:36:14.973 --> 00:36:17.035]  One lady said, are you making fun of these people?
[00:36:17.316 --> 00:36:18.637]  Why are they in your film?
[00:36:18.977 --> 00:36:19.438]  Why?
[00:36:19.538 --> 00:36:20.559]  Well, we say why!
[00:36:22.136 --> 00:36:34.980]  Now, I snuck into the Grove, I got video of it, I put it on the internet, I made a film about it, and suddenly, Mary Moore and other organizers of the yearly protest that's been going on for twenty-something years, were attacking me, going, he shouldn't talk about the occult!
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.560]  That doesn't go on in there!
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:37.341]  So what?
[00:36:37.461 --> 00:36:38.081]  Big deal!
[00:36:38.501 --> 00:36:40.502]  You know, don't talk about magic!
[00:36:41.062 --> 00:36:48.344]  And other local groups attacked me, and then we saw those very groups out there, in the protest, literally doing a
[00:36:49.352 --> 00:36:53.454]  Multi-hour long, I mean it went on for hour after hour, ritual.
[00:36:53.514 --> 00:36:56.696]  We got like five hours of this total, the whole protest and the ritual.
[00:36:58.376 --> 00:37:12.143]  And I mean, they call in the spirits and they got the circle and they got the pot and they put all their energy into the water and then they dump it and they... And it's a ritual to knock out the Grovers and take power away from them.
[00:37:13.274 --> 00:37:18.616]  I mean, man, anybody who knows anything about the occult knows that is Black Magic 101!
[00:37:21.058 --> 00:37:29.801]  I mean, even if these people believe in magic and think it's harmless and think it isn't bad, which it is, folks, they should know their own books!
[00:37:29.821 --> 00:37:34.884]  I mean, their own books say that is Black Magic, look out!
[00:37:36.264 --> 00:37:39.746]  I mean, they're in a circle, folks, directing spirits!
[00:37:40.481 --> 00:37:41.921]  To attack the Grove.
[00:37:41.961 --> 00:37:45.343]  That is, say it with me, black magic.
[00:37:45.363 --> 00:37:47.403]  And there were people last night that didn't even know that.
[00:37:47.763 --> 00:37:50.564]  They were sitting there arguing with me, telling me it wasn't black magic.
[00:37:51.965 --> 00:37:57.986]  So, I mean, not only are they doing magic, folks, it's black magic, which, it's all black magic, folks.
[00:37:58.587 --> 00:37:59.207]  And that's the point.
[00:37:59.227 --> 00:38:01.087]  This was overtly black magic.
[00:38:02.208 --> 00:38:06.309]  And then one atheist walked up to me and said, Alex, you know, again, why are you even getting into the occult?
[00:38:06.329 --> 00:38:07.169]  Why are you making this film?
[00:38:07.189 --> 00:38:08.190]  I was like, well, why are you here?
[00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.950]  Well, it's interesting.
[00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:09.650]  Well, exactly.
[00:38:10.752 --> 00:38:19.230]  Even if you don't believe in God, which I do, but even if you don't believe in God, you know, you've heard my view on this, it doesn't change the fact that our elite
[00:38:20.183 --> 00:38:22.405]  are doing this with all this pageantry.
[00:38:22.425 --> 00:38:26.648]  They've been doing it for thousands of years in a stylized theatrical display.
[00:38:26.969 --> 00:38:28.350]  They take it very seriously.
[00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:29.631]  Black magic to Moloch.
[00:38:30.171 --> 00:38:43.682]  Putting all their dirt, putting all their ju-ju, their who-ju, putting all of their conscience, because of the evil things they do, all the bad vibes, all the bad, you know, reap what you sow, karma, whatever they call it, onto this body.
[00:38:43.862 --> 00:38:44.603]  That's what they're doing.
[00:38:44.843 --> 00:38:48.266]  Just extreme, extreme black magic.
[00:38:48.326 --> 00:38:49.407]  It's like the portrait of
[00:38:49.947 --> 00:38:51.008]  Dorian Gray.
[00:38:51.068 --> 00:38:52.269]  I've got to add that to the film.
[00:38:53.109 --> 00:38:54.851]  Dorian Gray.
[00:38:55.551 --> 00:38:57.513]  You know that book?
[00:38:58.113 --> 00:38:58.813]  Who was that written by?
[00:38:58.833 --> 00:38:59.954]  Was that Edgar Allan Poe?
[00:38:59.994 --> 00:39:00.435]  I don't remember.
[00:39:00.455 --> 00:39:01.515]  I read it decades ago.
[00:39:01.575 --> 00:39:04.237]  I'm sure you've seen the old black and white movie.
[00:39:05.058 --> 00:39:05.959]  He never ages.
[00:39:06.119 --> 00:39:07.299]  He does all these evil things.
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.181]  Drugs, whores, murders, killing.
[00:39:09.621 --> 00:39:12.103]  But the painting is of a horrible demon.
[00:39:12.583 --> 00:39:14.545]  Everything he does, it goes on in the painting.
[00:39:15.305 --> 00:39:17.747]  Well, that's what they're doing at the Grove.
[00:39:18.633 --> 00:39:25.978]  And again, these people are so into their magic, so into their rituals, so into it, that they didn't like me criticizing.
[00:39:25.998 --> 00:39:32.722]  They didn't like me talking about George W. doing that, because they want to say he's a Christian, conservative, evil right-winger.
[00:39:33.142 --> 00:39:36.805]  They don't want me to talk about the gay porn stars and the gay prostitutes.
[00:39:36.845 --> 00:39:37.665]  They don't want that!
[00:39:37.745 --> 00:39:38.546]  They don't want it!
[00:39:38.986 --> 00:39:42.028]  They don't want their left-right paradigm shattered!
[00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:46.411]  See, I'm going to add even more to the order of death.
[00:39:46.431 --> 00:39:47.752]  I've decided not to release it immediately.
[00:39:49.368 --> 00:39:51.550]  I'm going to put it up for PrisonPlanet.TV members.
[00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:53.031]  The current version will be there.
[00:39:53.911 --> 00:39:55.593]  And for PrisonPlanet.TV members.
[00:39:56.133 --> 00:39:56.693]  But that's it.
[00:39:56.733 --> 00:39:58.695]  I'm going to add some stuff to this and change it.
[00:40:00.416 --> 00:40:06.160]  Yes, they don't like their precious magic being criticized.
[00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:06.520]  Period.
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:10.323]  They want to keep their false left-right paradigm.
[00:40:11.103 --> 00:40:13.725]  And so that's why I exposed it.
[00:40:15.347 --> 00:40:16.707]  What do they have to do with it?
[00:40:16.727 --> 00:40:19.088]  What did you put them in there for?
[00:40:21.009 --> 00:40:28.430]  Also, the people watching the film who don't like Bush were identifying with them, with the pagans, because they don't like Bush.
[00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:31.991]  And what I'm exposing is that the circle is complete.
[00:40:33.152 --> 00:40:36.473]  They're all part of the same paradigm.
[00:40:37.173 --> 00:40:39.533]  Just like the left and right are part of the same false paradigm.
[00:40:40.054 --> 00:40:40.874]  And I'm tired of it.
[00:40:40.914 --> 00:40:41.894]  I'm not going to put up with it anymore.
[00:40:43.194 --> 00:40:46.976]  Did you know left and right is a very deep, occult term itself?
[00:40:47.777 --> 00:40:54.460]  Left and right, the horned god is the right hand, and the goddess is the left hand.
[00:40:55.361 --> 00:40:55.941]  Did you know that?
[00:40:57.043 --> 00:41:07.268]  So when we do, this whole left-right didn't exist until a hundred years ago when the robber barons paid the university endowments to start this false political science of left-right.
[00:41:07.668 --> 00:41:09.509]  Before that, it didn't exist in politics.
[00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:11.130]  Before that, it was in magic.
[00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:19.814]  That's why Anton LaVey and Colonel Aquino at the Church of Set, or the Temple of Set, said we are the left-hand path.
[00:41:22.315 --> 00:41:25.937]  And then over time, it got associated with masculine or
[00:41:26.924 --> 00:41:33.345]  uh... the male patriarchal being the right and female being the left-hand path of the goddess.
[00:41:34.166 --> 00:41:41.007]  So again, when you even engage in left-right politics, I want Christians to know this, that is literally a magicka system.
[00:41:43.387 --> 00:41:52.529]  And for those that don't understand that, I'm sorry, you can ask Tex Marsh, you can ask anybody who's spent decades studying this, that's exactly what's going on and I'm not going to be part of it anymore.
[00:41:52.869 --> 00:41:54.730]  My paradigm is not their paradigm.
[00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:56.410]  I am outside this paradigm.
[00:41:57.225 --> 00:42:01.946]  And when we start thinking that way, it'll all make sense, and it won't be confusing anymore.
[00:42:03.426 --> 00:42:08.508]  Alright, we'll go ahead and take some calls, and then I want to get into the earthquake, I want to get into more on Bush and torture.
[00:42:09.648 --> 00:42:12.548]  Look at this headline, Prison Guards Enjoyed Torture.
[00:42:12.728 --> 00:42:16.209]  Here's another one, Victim of Police Beating Says He Was Sober, I want to talk about that some more.
[00:42:16.709 --> 00:42:24.231]  Very important article, finally it's gotten so bad, this is out of the Associated Press, there's also one here out of the News of Australia,
[00:42:25.876 --> 00:42:27.337]  You won't get this here in the US.
[00:42:27.718 --> 00:42:32.962]  Border agents in armored cars after surge of violence and massive machine gun attacks.
[00:42:35.204 --> 00:42:35.604]  Oh yeah!
[00:42:37.306 --> 00:42:48.716]  So finally they've delivered APCs to the Border Patrol because the rocket attacks and the machine gun attacks and the burning and the running, you know, gun battles and the deaths they're mounting.
[00:42:50.032 --> 00:42:52.253]  I quit counting in the first eight months of this year.
[00:42:52.333 --> 00:42:53.593]  I quit counting a month and a half ago.
[00:42:54.073 --> 00:42:56.054]  And it was 627 deaths.
[00:42:56.914 --> 00:42:59.715]  Just in the Texas side of the border and the Mexico-Texas side.
[00:43:00.355 --> 00:43:01.915]  Just absolute total budlam.
[00:43:03.296 --> 00:43:03.916]  Here's another one.
[00:43:03.976 --> 00:43:06.136]  Harvest of death on the eastern shore.
[00:43:06.156 --> 00:43:09.317]  This is out of the Virginia Post by Bill Burke.
[00:43:10.197 --> 00:43:11.438]  And 25% of all fatalities since 2002
[00:43:16.511 --> 00:43:16.912]  I don't know.
[00:43:35.755 --> 00:43:39.679]  You pull up beside him and it's an illegal alien man, drunkard and a skunk.
[00:43:40.259 --> 00:43:41.420]  And the cops pull them over.
[00:43:41.961 --> 00:43:43.122]  They don't even have IDs.
[00:43:43.142 --> 00:43:46.825]  They get out in a couple days, skip bail, get some more fake documents.
[00:43:47.266 --> 00:43:48.046]  Everybody knows this.
[00:43:48.106 --> 00:43:49.428]  It's like that railway killer.
[00:43:49.988 --> 00:43:52.931]  How many... I know it was over ten people he killed.
[00:43:53.431 --> 00:43:54.552]  They'd release him each time.
[00:43:55.733 --> 00:43:58.616]  And he was out, you know, just doing whatever he wanted.
[00:43:58.916 --> 00:44:00.758]  The point is, they're first class citizens.
[00:44:00.818 --> 00:44:01.979]  In fact, they're even above cops.
[00:44:02.797 --> 00:44:05.659]  Illegal aliens have more rights than anybody in this society.
[00:44:06.479 --> 00:44:13.383]  They're like a special... I mean, even Jeb Bush's son, you know, leans back when the cops grab him for drinking in a bar.
[00:44:13.403 --> 00:44:14.763]  Ooh, think of the horror of it.
[00:44:15.284 --> 00:44:20.226]  And, you know, he gets beat up for it and charged with a bunch of stuff, but not the godlike illegal aliens.
[00:44:20.246 --> 00:44:23.048]  I mean, it's just they're better than the cops out drunk.
[00:44:23.688 --> 00:44:24.789]  Now, you know, he'll get in trouble.
[00:44:25.289 --> 00:44:26.810]  But nope, not the illegal aliens.
[00:44:26.850 --> 00:44:28.370]  They're just above everybody.
[00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:29.351]  In fact, I kept saying they were
[00:44:30.317 --> 00:44:31.938]  Above us, but below the politicians.
[00:44:31.958 --> 00:44:32.639]  That's not true.
[00:44:33.219 --> 00:44:34.721]  They actually are a whole new group.
[00:44:34.761 --> 00:44:36.242]  They're just absolute kings.
[00:44:37.463 --> 00:44:40.125]  McCain is chiding Schwarzenegger over stage rallies.
[00:44:40.145 --> 00:44:40.805]  This is out of Reuters.
[00:44:41.966 --> 00:44:56.117]  Yeah, Schwarzenegger, this was in the San Francisco Chronicle a few months ago, he wanted to show how bad the roads were, so he had a crew come out with jackhammers and tear up an entire pedestrian area and a two-lane road in the neighborhood.
[00:44:57.509 --> 00:44:58.910]  No one is allowed in that criticizes Schwarzenegger
[00:45:13.743 --> 00:45:17.965]  There are huge steroided thugs, and I've seen it on TV, standing all around.
[00:45:18.566 --> 00:45:20.947]  They might let 50 people into a, quote, town hall meeting.
[00:45:20.967 --> 00:45:24.268]  They'll have 50 security people, dressed plainclothes, clapping.
[00:45:24.809 --> 00:45:26.510]  Literally, one for one in many cases.
[00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:27.110]  This has been in the news.
[00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:29.591]  Standing by each person, just ready to grab you.
[00:45:29.931 --> 00:45:32.573]  Old woman, they'll grab you around the throat, grab you out.
[00:45:33.073 --> 00:45:33.753]  Just waiting.
[00:45:35.674 --> 00:45:38.216]  Just, literally, this is our free country.
[00:45:38.236 --> 00:45:38.776]  Just ready.
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:56.667]  That little pencil-necked, roid-head, stumbling around with all his... after he has a three-hour hairdo done each time he appears, stumbling around just absolutely dumber than dirt, stumbling around with all his bodyguards, and I'm sick of it!
[00:45:57.827 --> 00:46:07.971]  And so McCain, who's pretty bad himself, I thought was getting some political points on Schwartzy's back, because he went to it and he said, well this isn't a town hall meeting, I've been to these public things and they're
[00:46:08.539 --> 00:46:10.500]  They're totally staged, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:11.200]  You shouldn't do that.
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:13.721]  That's really hurt him.
[00:46:13.801 --> 00:46:19.082]  I mean, literally, people buy tickets and go to movies they don't know Arnold's about to show up to.
[00:46:19.102 --> 00:46:20.403]  And all of a sudden, he swaggers in.
[00:46:20.423 --> 00:46:24.284]  And, oh, that woman's wearing a nursing uniform.
[00:46:24.304 --> 00:46:25.764]  She just got off work and came here.
[00:46:26.204 --> 00:46:26.485]  Get her.
[00:46:26.505 --> 00:46:27.785]  And they're just goons.
[00:46:27.865 --> 00:46:28.805]  Literal goons.
[00:46:29.245 --> 00:46:32.226]  Private security forces paid for by the government in the state of California.
[00:46:32.486 --> 00:46:33.747]  Just drag out old women.
[00:46:33.787 --> 00:46:36.588]  I mean, it's just... Those like the way she looks.
[00:46:36.788 --> 00:46:37.388]  Seize her!
[00:46:38.587 --> 00:46:40.529]  And then he gets up at the Republican National Convention.
[00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:48.037]  I remember being afraid they would take us out of our car, the Soviets, on the Soviet zone of Austria.
[00:46:50.961 --> 00:46:58.589]  So, uh... Which, by the way, by the time he was won, there wasn't even a Soviet zone, so that's another lie, but...
[00:46:59.935 --> 00:47:02.958]  You know, this is the point, is that it's staged.
[00:47:03.038 --> 00:47:09.423]  I mean, literally, Bush, you know, has made in America, spray-painted on boxes, and nothing's made in America.
[00:47:09.684 --> 00:47:12.226]  That's a felony each time you do that in a warehouse, by the way.
[00:47:12.526 --> 00:47:17.350]  Falsely putting a sign or spray-paint of where something's from.
[00:47:18.411 --> 00:47:19.032]  So it doesn't matter.
[00:47:19.052 --> 00:47:20.693]  You're not going to get in trouble for it.
[00:47:21.354 --> 00:47:27.019]  You know, they told everybody, there's a bunch of examples, but an old one from like three years ago, is they told everybody in Indianapolis,
[00:47:27.785 --> 00:47:29.466]  Thousands in this big auditorium.
[00:47:29.486 --> 00:47:31.187]  They said, everyone take your ties off!
[00:47:32.047 --> 00:47:33.068]  And a few people refused.
[00:47:33.128 --> 00:47:34.828]  The Secret Service said, look, you're going to be thrown out.
[00:47:35.769 --> 00:47:36.409]  They said, why?
[00:47:36.449 --> 00:47:42.232]  Well, and it came out, the President's people said it would look more mainstream if no one was wearing a tie.
[00:47:42.312 --> 00:47:50.256]  I mean, we'll kick you out or arrest you if you don't take your... It's just the added... the fakeness of... and of course the Democrats do this too.
[00:47:52.777 --> 00:47:56.258]  And I know most of you know that, but I mean, just Bush is as fake as a $3 bill.
[00:47:56.278 --> 00:47:57.599]  Alright, let's take some calls.
[00:47:58.869 --> 00:48:03.371]  Let's go ahead and go to Keith in Ohio.
[00:48:03.431 --> 00:48:04.091]  Keith, go ahead.
[00:48:04.111 --> 00:48:04.991]  Hello, Alex.
[00:48:05.332 --> 00:48:05.612]  Hi.
[00:48:05.792 --> 00:48:09.953]  Just the first thing, you know, it's so important to be built up with the Word of God.
[00:48:10.013 --> 00:48:16.495]  There's a good program through the Bible with Dr. McGee on the Internet, you know, because we've got to build ourselves up in the Word of God.
[00:48:16.655 --> 00:48:19.716]  Did Dr. McGee tell us to love George Bush as a Christian?
[00:48:20.177 --> 00:48:22.898]  No, he quoted the scripture which says, Jesus said,
[00:48:25.586 --> 00:48:32.788]  Every liar is going to have their part in a lake of fire, so if that's your habit of lifestyle, if that's what you are, according to God's judgment.
[00:48:33.948 --> 00:48:36.629]  I'm familiar, I think, with Dr. McGee.
[00:48:36.809 --> 00:48:38.929]  I know I've heard quite a few of his sermons on the radio.
[00:48:39.049 --> 00:48:41.430]  He's got the best Bible teaching I know of, and it's so important.
[00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:43.170]  Does he tell us George Bush is good, though?
[00:48:44.171 --> 00:48:45.931]  Does he specifically call Bush out?
[00:48:47.191 --> 00:48:48.612]  That's kind of the test right there.
[00:48:48.652 --> 00:48:51.392]  He's now with the Lord, of course, for quite a number of years.
[00:48:54.369 --> 00:49:04.156]  He holds to the King James, which is not a translation that's not been perverted, but if I might preach just a little bit here to those that are doing evil.
[00:49:04.176 --> 00:49:11.682]  You know, the Word of God teaches that every thought that we think, and every word that we say, and every deed that we do, we're going to give account to the true God.
[00:49:12.403 --> 00:49:16.226]  And we ought to learn a few things from the demons.
[00:49:16.286 --> 00:49:19.228]  In the book of James, it says that the demons believe.
[00:49:19.288 --> 00:49:21.970]  They believe there is a God, they know who He is, and they tremble.
[00:49:22.614 --> 00:49:31.340]  Even in the time of the Lord Jesus, they begged the Lord Jesus when they came upon Him, to not torment them before their time.
[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:46.510]  And the Word of God teaches many scriptures here, Luke 12, that we need not fear him who can kill the body, but him who after he's killed the body has the power to cast into hell.
[00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:49.131]  The people need evidence outside the Bible.
[00:49:49.151 --> 00:49:51.411]  There's a book called The Hell and Back Ride Rawlings.
[00:49:51.492 --> 00:49:52.752]  It's very good and solid.
[00:49:53.352 --> 00:50:02.795]  And also the Word of God teaches that, you know, Mark 9, it teaches of those that end up in hell where their worm dies not and the fire is not quenched.
[00:50:03.236 --> 00:50:10.198]  Now these people like, whether you're at the low level or at the high level, you're doing evil and you die on your sins.
[00:50:10.438 --> 00:50:13.139]  What would Hitler or Lenin or Stalin be saying right now?
[00:50:13.857 --> 00:50:17.480]  If you go right to Luke 16, it gives an account of a man that went to hell.
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:22.643]  He was in the torments of flames, and he begged that his brothers be told not to come to this place.
[00:50:23.343 --> 00:50:26.806]  And especially those that do evil against the innocent and the weak.
[00:50:26.966 --> 00:50:29.668]  Yeah, I think in that passage, couldn't he see him up there?
[00:50:29.708 --> 00:50:31.109]  And he was saying, tell them, warn them.
[00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:31.769]  Luke 16, yep.
[00:50:33.331 --> 00:50:34.052]  It's not a parable.
[00:50:34.072 --> 00:50:36.113]  If I could hold over, Alex... No, I've got to move on.
[00:50:36.133 --> 00:50:37.294]  We've got to get to the other callers.
[00:50:37.374 --> 00:50:38.995]  I appreciate the sermon.
[00:50:39.015 --> 00:50:39.696]  That was interesting.
[00:50:40.736 --> 00:50:42.358]  We're going to come back and take some more calls.
[00:50:42.378 --> 00:50:44.199]  You're welcome to call in in a week or so.
[00:50:44.919 --> 00:50:46.040]  We'll be right back, folks.
[00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:47.761]  We've got a ton of your calls, a ton of news.
[00:50:47.821 --> 00:50:48.322]  Stay with us.
[00:50:48.822 --> 00:50:49.783]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:49.883 --> 00:50:50.964]  And don't forget the websites.
[00:50:51.024 --> 00:50:54.186]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:51:02.791 --> 00:51:05.612]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.912 --> 00:51:07.493]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:07.813 --> 00:51:12.495]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:12.835 --> 00:51:19.578]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:19.898 --> 00:51:21.880]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:24.942]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:25.022 --> 00:51:29.706]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:29.886 --> 00:51:34.309]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:41.755]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[00:52:09.604 --> 00:52:20.536]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:52:20.796 --> 00:52:22.578]  Yet require very little energy.
[00:52:22.858 --> 00:52:26.181]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:52:26.501 --> 00:52:36.970]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:37.770]  That's right!
[00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:45.052]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.

[00:54:08.056 --> 00:54:10.418]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:20.846]  One big problem is people in the world, young people and others, see how phony the Christian church is, how evil it is.
[00:54:21.646 --> 00:54:25.750]  Or they go to churches, young people, and see how corrupt it is from the inside.
[00:54:27.271 --> 00:54:29.993]  But they really shouldn't, you know, judge God
[00:54:31.474 --> 00:54:32.855]  Judge the church by that?
[00:54:35.636 --> 00:54:37.437]  I've seen the fruits of all this occult stuff.
[00:54:37.477 --> 00:54:38.878]  It's very, very destructive.
[00:54:38.938 --> 00:54:39.758]  I'm not going to sit up here.
[00:54:39.778 --> 00:54:40.398]  I'm not a preacher.
[00:54:40.438 --> 00:54:41.259]  It's not my job.
[00:54:41.699 --> 00:54:42.840]  This is a news program.
[00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:50.363]  People are welcome to have their comments about it, but I'm not going to throw stones or tell people what's in their eye.
[00:54:50.423 --> 00:54:51.804]  I've got plenty of problems myself.
[00:54:55.177 --> 00:55:00.300]  So many people that quote think they're Christian are like, yeah, we need to torture people in Iraq!
[00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:01.081]  Yeah, the war!
[00:55:01.161 --> 00:55:02.302]  I love war!
[00:55:02.862 --> 00:55:04.143]  I love George Bush!
[00:55:05.884 --> 00:55:08.486]  And their brains, their souls are in the wrong place.
[00:55:08.526 --> 00:55:18.272]  I mean, if you can't see that George Bush is evil, that he's a grasping little puppet, then I mean, how could you be in the right place spiritually?
[00:55:18.812 --> 00:55:19.933]  But it's just not the case.
[00:55:21.297 --> 00:55:27.079]  Well, I mean, in fact, it's Christians who are the biggest group, real Christians, that are fighting the New World Order and fighting Bush.
[00:55:27.619 --> 00:55:31.921]  And you've got that mass of people that think they're Christians who are totally delusional.
[00:55:32.301 --> 00:55:35.782]  Alright, I want to go to your calls so everybody gets a chance to get involved on air here.
[00:55:36.582 --> 00:55:40.224]  Let's go ahead and talk to Gavin.
[00:55:41.004 --> 00:55:42.044]  Gavin in Texas.
[00:55:42.084 --> 00:55:42.805]  Go ahead, Gavin.
[00:55:43.145 --> 00:55:43.445]  Yes.
[00:55:43.705 --> 00:55:49.527]  I was about 45 miles north of Jasper when it got tore up there in Rita.
[00:55:50.322 --> 00:55:55.525]  And right after the hurricane, which nowadays, I lived out here growing up, and it never looked like it does now.
[00:55:55.605 --> 00:55:58.047]  Chemtrails galore.
[00:55:58.107 --> 00:56:09.574]  Driving home the other day, late in the afternoon, hadn't seen planes all day long, but there had been some over, I don't know, the night before, when they're doing them, but there's lots of chemtrails out here.
[00:56:09.594 --> 00:56:18.119]  Some constant haze, I can see all the way across the lake, a three miles long open view, and it's just hazy all the time.
[00:56:18.855 --> 00:56:24.020]  By the way, NASA admits the Earth is 20% darker now on average.
[00:56:25.301 --> 00:56:31.286]  Well, I certainly believe it, because it's an apparent issue.
[00:56:31.746 --> 00:56:35.429]  Well, that means seven years ago, trails disappeared in seconds or minutes.
[00:56:35.469 --> 00:56:36.830]  Now they stay there for five hours.
[00:56:37.411 --> 00:56:38.572]  I was watching trails.
[00:56:39.933 --> 00:56:41.955]  I went and swam some laps of the day for about an hour.
[00:56:42.835 --> 00:56:47.039]  And I was watching jets fly over and leave trails at about 3,000 feet coming into the airport.
[00:56:48.448 --> 00:56:53.070]  So they were descending or ascending, and I mean, an hour later there were trails there.
[00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:55.850]  I mean, they just don't go away.
[00:56:56.271 --> 00:56:56.451]  Yeah.
[00:56:57.751 --> 00:56:58.371]  What is that?
[00:56:59.832 --> 00:57:03.833]  It seems to me, I think they were able to control the weather patterns with it, with all the heavy metals and everything.
[00:57:04.193 --> 00:57:06.494]  I've listened to you a long time, five years now.
[00:57:06.514 --> 00:57:09.215]  Yeah, that's what meteorologists and people we've had on say, yeah.
[00:57:09.315 --> 00:57:10.395]  Well, then that's probably where I heard that.
[00:57:11.013 --> 00:57:11.934]  But it makes a good sense.
[00:57:11.954 --> 00:57:17.637]  We've never had 100 mile an hour winds way up here in the Piney Woods, East Texas until this latest catastrophe of Rita.
[00:57:17.897 --> 00:57:19.478]  But anyway, thank you.
[00:57:20.099 --> 00:57:20.919]  Thank you for the call.
[00:57:20.959 --> 00:57:22.560]  Appreciate the fine points, Gavin.
[00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:24.021]  Linda and Tejas.
[00:57:24.081 --> 00:57:24.901]  Linda, go ahead.
[00:57:25.682 --> 00:57:26.342]  Hi Alex.
[00:57:26.622 --> 00:57:33.887]  Last week you were accusing your audience of not supporting some of these changes that we want.
[00:57:34.067 --> 00:57:35.648]  And every 20 minutes you were
[00:57:36.679 --> 00:57:44.322]  I'm posting a little infomercial on going to the Texas Toll Party meeting on Saturday, so I went.
[00:57:44.502 --> 00:57:45.563]  No, no, I don't do that.
[00:57:45.643 --> 00:57:48.044]  That's local radio stations.
[00:57:48.084 --> 00:57:52.205]  See, the network isn't the radio, and there are multiple networks on local stations.
[00:57:53.986 --> 00:57:59.068]  I'm on stations at night and Rush Limbaugh's on during the day, and people call in going, your buddy Rush Limbaugh said this.
[00:58:00.028 --> 00:58:01.569]  It's separate.
[00:58:02.114 --> 00:58:09.637]  There's a lot of people who pose like they're affiliated with me on another network locally and then try to get support that's meant for us.
[00:58:10.397 --> 00:58:13.178]  So, no ma'am, I was not doing that.
[00:58:13.698 --> 00:58:16.400]  You do oppose the toll roads in Texas.
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:17.780]  Of course I do, yes I do.
[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:22.622]  But I was just letting you know that you were saying I was challenging you every 20 minutes and I wasn't.
[00:58:22.642 --> 00:58:23.962]  Tell you what, stay there Linda.
[00:58:24.783 --> 00:58:26.924]  You went to the toll meeting, I want to hear about it.
[00:58:26.944 --> 00:58:28.604]  This is important for everybody nationwide.
[00:58:29.064 --> 00:58:30.545]  Tell me about it when we start the next hour.
[00:58:31.673 --> 00:58:33.374]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[00:58:34.035 --> 00:58:36.036]  And we'll start the second hour.
[00:58:36.076 --> 00:58:40.420]  PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com are the websites.
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:45.924]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.810 --> 00:58:58.431]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.111 --> 00:59:00.171]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.871 --> 00:59:02.051]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.631 --> 00:59:03.452]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.212 --> 00:59:05.152]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.772 --> 00:59:09.773]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.953 --> 00:59:14.094]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.295 --> 00:59:21.555]  Alright, my friends, we are now into hour number two.
[00:59:21.595 --> 00:59:23.116]  Thirty seconds into hour number two.
[00:59:23.156 --> 00:59:23.556]  Thank you.
[00:59:24.346 --> 00:59:24.966]  We're joining us.
[00:59:25.006 --> 00:59:33.248]  We're talking about Lord Bush saying, hey, torture's good and I'm going to veto a law saying we can only torture people a little bit.
[00:59:33.808 --> 00:59:34.788]  That's not enough for me.
[00:59:34.808 --> 00:59:36.128]  I agree with Alberto Gonzalez.
[00:59:36.708 --> 00:59:38.789]  We should torture people to death.
[00:59:38.849 --> 00:59:39.929]  And that's what his memo says.
[00:59:41.449 --> 00:59:42.189]  That's the policy.
[00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:46.430]  But if you get caught or dumb enough to take pictures of it, we're going to put you in prison.
[00:59:47.010 --> 00:59:49.991]  Follow orders, torture them good, be paid well, enjoy yourselves.
[00:59:50.723 --> 00:59:55.286]  Those of you that are sadistic psychopaths can come work for us, but if you tell anybody, we're not going to defend you.
[00:59:56.948 --> 01:00:02.332]  And what's happening with the economy, what's happening with just a whole host of issues coming up in the next two hours.
[01:00:03.272 --> 01:00:04.193]  This new hate bill.
[01:00:04.633 --> 01:00:07.716]  Ron Paul will be joining us coming up in the next hour.
[01:00:08.716 --> 01:00:10.398]  Talk about some very serious issues.
[01:00:10.418 --> 01:00:13.820]  The Congressman will give us an update in the middle of the next hour.
[01:00:15.902 --> 01:00:16.622]  So that's coming up.
[01:00:16.642 --> 01:00:19.885]  I also want to get Pastor Pike on with an update for ten minutes or so on
[01:00:20.635 --> 01:00:22.716]  We're on the very edge of thought crimes bill passing.
[01:00:22.756 --> 01:00:25.476]  And listen, I don't want to sound like I'm obnoxious or rude.
[01:00:26.717 --> 01:00:30.718]  Linda is a very sweet caller and very nice lady.
[01:00:30.738 --> 01:00:31.578]  She just called in.
[01:00:32.178 --> 01:00:40.441]  We're about to go back to her and she said, I heard you were running announcements locally for the Austin Toll Party admonishing us to go get involved.
[01:00:41.361 --> 01:00:44.942]  And I love the Austin Toll Party and Linda Curtis and of course
[01:00:45.842 --> 01:00:47.663]  This is another Linda, not Linda Curtis on the line.
[01:00:48.263 --> 01:00:50.744]  And Sal Costello and all the great folks there.
[01:00:51.445 --> 01:00:53.045]  So I don't want you to think I'm talking about them.
[01:00:53.065 --> 01:00:58.508]  It's just a pet peeve of mine that people don't differentiate affiliates.
[01:00:59.528 --> 01:01:03.870]  We are the GCN, the Genesis, Genesis Network.
[01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:05.851]  We're not one of those other networks.
[01:01:06.451 --> 01:01:08.212]  Some are good, some are bad, some are ugly.
[01:01:09.513 --> 01:01:12.334]  We also, when you hear local ads,
[01:01:13.579 --> 01:01:23.081]  Or when you hear basically what other talk show hosts are saying, that's not us in many cases.
[01:01:23.121 --> 01:01:23.701]  You have to listen.
[01:01:23.861 --> 01:01:24.881]  Is it Genesis?
[01:01:26.141 --> 01:01:35.483]  And you know I have to say this because other patriots, if you can call them that, have gotten very good at acting like they're us.
[01:01:36.283 --> 01:01:39.044]  And I've put up with it for years and I'm not putting up with it anymore.
[01:01:39.798 --> 01:01:45.781]  You know, if you support this programming, and myself, and Alex Jones, and blah blah blah, then you need to send me money!
[01:01:46.822 --> 01:01:48.903]  And they're not even affiliated with us.
[01:01:48.983 --> 01:01:53.685]  And people come up to me and go, I gave them a thousand dollars, Alex, and for you!
[01:01:53.705 --> 01:01:55.466]  And I'm like, well that ain't me, Bubba!
[01:01:56.146 --> 01:01:57.247]  And I don't ask for money.
[01:01:57.967 --> 01:02:00.289]  A few times I've said, if you want to support us, you're welcome to.
[01:02:00.729 --> 01:02:03.350]  It's just, look, I've told people, I'm not putting up with anything anymore.
[01:02:03.850 --> 01:02:06.692]  Life's too short, and I just, every time somebody,
[01:02:07.718 --> 01:02:14.322]  Only a hundred people showed up and I was frustrated because you had said earlier in the week that your listeners are not taking the action, the support we need to do.
[01:02:14.342 --> 01:02:15.383]  So I went to the meeting
[01:02:30.450 --> 01:02:34.515]  I still have faith in that even a hundred people can communicate with another.
[01:02:34.595 --> 01:02:35.756]  Are you sure you heard me say that?
[01:02:35.796 --> 01:02:37.558]  I'm not one of the people that beats everybody up.
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:41.502]  I think people are doing a great job of fighting the New World Order.
[01:02:42.143 --> 01:02:43.985]  Well, I think we have to do more.
[01:02:44.005 --> 01:02:49.071]  At the meeting, they said we need to write letters to the editors.
[01:02:49.827 --> 01:03:03.760]  We need to go on to tollparty.com and print out flyers that are saying vote no on Propositions 1 and 9, because these are the... Terry and his cronies... This is how they're... Yeah, no, it's texastollparty.com.
[01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:11.788]  texastollparty.com and make up flyers and take them to your driver's... Well, they just filed a lawsuit on these people, so they're definitely doing a good job.
[01:03:13.355 --> 01:03:23.297]  Yeah, but we need more in this... Well, I mean, we've had meetings where 1,000, 1,200 people show up, you know, down there, and it's overflow, and they still vote against us.
[01:03:24.078 --> 01:03:27.238]  98% in state polls, 93% in Austin are against it.
[01:03:27.679 --> 01:03:29.119]  Why is Will Wynn doing this?
[01:03:29.199 --> 01:03:30.279]  Why is Campo doing this?
[01:03:30.679 --> 01:03:33.560]  Because they got electronic voting machines in and don't care.
[01:03:35.214 --> 01:03:37.957]  But listen, Linda, I think you did a great job.
[01:03:38.018 --> 01:03:40.040]  Those hundred people that showed up did a great job, okay?
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:47.689]  Well, tell all the voters in Texas to vote no on November 8th for Proposition 1 and 9.
[01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:50.993]  And Linda, don't let people beat you up for not doing enough.
[01:03:51.033 --> 01:03:52.035]  You guys are doing a great job.
[01:03:54.275 --> 01:04:01.659]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:04:01.939 --> 01:04:06.682]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:04:06.902 --> 01:04:12.545]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:04:12.785 --> 01:04:17.308]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:04:17.529 --> 01:04:24.694]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:04:24.714 --> 01:04:29.257]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.397 --> 01:04:31.919]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:04:32.159 --> 01:04:38.884]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[01:07:04.453 --> 01:07:05.853]  Look at this headline I've got.
[01:07:05.973 --> 01:07:09.774]  House urges to investigate the Royal Marshall Law Plan.
[01:07:11.815 --> 01:07:13.155]  INQ7TV.
[01:07:13.255 --> 01:07:17.637]  I mean, this is... Just every day, Marshall Law this, world government that.
[01:07:18.057 --> 01:07:19.497]  Oh, this city wants Marshall Law.
[01:07:19.557 --> 01:07:20.517]  That county wants it.
[01:07:21.318 --> 01:07:22.038]  I mean, it just...
[01:07:23.118 --> 01:07:26.179]  It's incredible the type of things that are happening right now.
[01:07:27.399 --> 01:07:32.220]  Look, I want to get through the calls here, so I'm giving each caller about a minute.
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:33.460]  We're going to your right now.
[01:07:34.341 --> 01:07:41.302]  This takes self-control for myself because I'm very long-winded and our listeners have a lot to say, but we've got to get everybody on here.
[01:07:42.122 --> 01:07:44.043]  Let's go ahead and talk to Judy in New York.
[01:07:44.103 --> 01:07:44.763]  Judy, go ahead.
[01:07:45.362 --> 01:07:46.783]  Pleasure to speak with you, Alex.
[01:07:47.123 --> 01:07:49.664]  My comment is about your comment about Wicca.
[01:07:49.684 --> 01:07:52.505]  There has to be at least one person, right?
[01:07:52.825 --> 01:08:05.271]  I've been up close and personal with most religions, and there must be various factions of Wicca, because we were always instructed that you were supposed to harm ye no one, and then there was the law of three.
[01:08:05.311 --> 01:08:07.772]  What you do to others comes back to you threefold.
[01:08:08.192 --> 01:08:10.273]  And we were also taught to respect all paths.
[01:08:10.893 --> 01:08:14.735]  So I was a little confused, unless there are different factions.
[01:08:15.365 --> 01:08:22.089]  Well, I mean, there is video of this, and they're, you know, sending spirits into the Grove.
[01:08:22.109 --> 01:08:24.851]  Yeah, well, I'm sorry to hear that.
[01:08:24.991 --> 01:08:26.952]  You know, I have nothing against Wiccan.
[01:08:26.972 --> 01:08:28.873]  I'm not a practicing Wiccan at this point.
[01:08:29.193 --> 01:08:33.616]  Also, by the way, just a little aside, you wanted to know, Dorian Gray was written by Oscar Wilde.
[01:08:33.636 --> 01:08:34.856]  Oh, Oscar Wilde!
[01:08:35.056 --> 01:08:36.777]  But you notice I said, I think I'm wrong.
[01:08:36.958 --> 01:08:39.959]  I mean, I did catch myself, but yeah, yeah.
[01:08:39.979 --> 01:08:42.661]  You have to be wrong about something sometime, you know.
[01:08:43.381 --> 01:08:46.242]  I'm wrong a lot of the time, but I wish I was wrong about the New World Order.
[01:08:46.282 --> 01:08:47.182]  I know I'm right about that.
[01:08:47.682 --> 01:08:56.864]  You know, I don't want to take up all your time, but I fall asleep with Genesis on, and I'm usually in the middle of how your program gets into my dream state, and it's so funny.
[01:08:56.904 --> 01:09:00.064]  Last night I dreamed that I was lecturing to people about the New World Order.
[01:09:01.324 --> 01:09:02.025]  Well, that's good.
[01:09:02.085 --> 01:09:03.285]  We need you out there doing that.
[01:09:04.965 --> 01:09:06.425]  Okay, it was a pleasure, Alex.
[01:09:06.886 --> 01:09:07.646]  Thank you for the call.
[01:09:07.666 --> 01:09:09.046]  I appreciate the call.
[01:09:10.277 --> 01:09:18.301]  No, I mean, people ask, why did I put these pagans, wiccans, some are calling themselves pagans, wiccans, whatever, in the film?
[01:09:18.381 --> 01:09:26.785]  Because this group was criticizing us for talking about Bush and the occult, and so then we go out there the next year and there they are doing it.
[01:09:27.885 --> 01:09:31.507]  And so, you know, we didn't draw first blood here, folks.
[01:09:31.547 --> 01:09:34.208]  We have this group criticizing and attacking us.
[01:09:35.226 --> 01:09:38.107]  And so that's why we put it in the film.
[01:09:38.167 --> 01:09:42.709]  And it isn't to get even, it's to show the incredible hypocrisy.
[01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:46.430]  That's why we put it in there.
[01:09:46.470 --> 01:09:49.611]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:09:50.091 --> 01:09:53.632]  Let's talk to Eric in Connecticut, up there in Skull and Bones country.
[01:09:54.532 --> 01:09:56.573]  Hello Alex, welcome from Skull and Bones country.
[01:09:56.933 --> 01:09:57.433]  That's right.
[01:09:58.254 --> 01:10:02.175]  I just got through watching Eyes Wide Shut.
[01:10:03.942 --> 01:10:05.022]  I've never seen it before.
[01:10:05.903 --> 01:10:09.904]  Very interesting movie, and for those who have not seen it, I highly recommend it.
[01:10:11.224 --> 01:10:27.009]  It offers a very revealing glimpse, speaking of the rituals, and speaking of the Wiccans and all this other thing, where Tom Cruise plays the part of a doctor for this rich guy, and I'll make a long story short.
[01:10:27.029 --> 01:10:29.310]  And his wife's really part of the cult, trying to get him into it?
[01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:30.090]  Yes.
[01:10:31.267 --> 01:10:38.153]  And, uh, there's a scene where, uh, the doctor is being told by his rich employer just what the story is.
[01:10:39.855 --> 01:10:44.018]  And he said that, um, he said, Bill, I'm not going to tell you.
[01:10:44.038 --> 01:10:49.143]  Are you still there?
[01:10:49.463 --> 01:10:50.764]  Been in for the past 24 hours.
[01:10:50.804 --> 01:10:52.966]  You know, you pause for a second.
[01:10:52.986 --> 01:10:54.808]  You've caught out there for a period of time.
[01:10:55.108 --> 01:10:56.149]  You have to repeat what you said.
[01:10:56.309 --> 01:10:56.489]  Okay.
[01:10:56.509 --> 01:10:57.010]  I'm sorry.
[01:10:57.991 --> 01:10:58.071]  Um,
[01:10:59.932 --> 01:11:11.162]  Tom Cruise playing this doctor was told by his boss that because he had snuck into the ritual, he said to him, I don't think you realize what kind of trouble you've been in for the past 24 hours, Bill.
[01:11:11.182 --> 01:11:14.364]  Because if I told you, who do you think was there?
[01:11:14.424 --> 01:11:15.746]  Just ordinary people?
[01:11:16.586 --> 01:11:18.428]  Those weren't just ordinary people.
[01:11:19.209 --> 01:11:26.535]  Because if I told you their names, I'm not going to tell you their names, but if I was to tell you their names, you might not sleep so well.
[01:11:27.867 --> 01:11:32.010]  And I think it really speaks to just who's involved in these rituals.
[01:11:32.590 --> 01:11:39.874]  People need to understand that this occult practice goes to the highest levels of our government.
[01:11:41.015 --> 01:11:48.039]  And I don't think a lot of people realize just what scale, the scale of these occult rituals.
[01:11:48.419 --> 01:11:49.980]  Well, it's like an eyes wide shut.
[01:11:50.641 --> 01:11:57.485]  They've got a pianist there who doesn't even know why he's been hired and brought there, just like the Grove.
[01:11:58.494 --> 01:12:00.195]  And this is more of an inner circle.
[01:12:00.215 --> 01:12:02.856]  There's just a few hundred people or a hundred people involved.
[01:12:03.616 --> 01:12:06.438]  And it's done stylized like a play.
[01:12:06.558 --> 01:12:08.278]  Look, I'm trying to explain to people.
[01:12:08.799 --> 01:12:12.960]  That's where acting and plays and theater comes from.
[01:12:13.301 --> 01:12:15.822]  The people up on the stage, the people in the crowd.
[01:12:16.482 --> 01:12:18.603]  Rituals grew into theater.
[01:12:19.668 --> 01:12:23.912]  And so when they're really doing a ritual, it's done stylized like a play.
[01:12:24.333 --> 01:12:26.575]  It's like when you go to church, you know, Christian church.
[01:12:26.955 --> 01:12:29.898]  You got the preacher, you got the choir, you got the people.
[01:12:30.298 --> 01:12:32.380]  It's all done in a regimented format.
[01:12:32.741 --> 01:12:36.604]  Well, it's the same thing for the occultists, for the pagans, for the Luciferians.
[01:12:38.846 --> 01:12:41.447]  Kubrick, and there's been reports on this.
[01:12:41.467 --> 01:12:42.567]  It was his last movie.
[01:12:42.947 --> 01:12:43.748]  It was his last movie.
[01:12:43.768 --> 01:12:44.268]  He died.
[01:12:44.808 --> 01:12:46.609]  He wanted to leave some stuff in.
[01:12:46.629 --> 01:12:47.549]  There was a big argument.
[01:12:47.929 --> 01:12:48.870]  Suddenly he died.
[01:12:49.450 --> 01:12:50.550]  Some stuff got cut out.
[01:12:50.610 --> 01:12:51.270]  We know that.
[01:12:51.891 --> 01:12:54.652]  But, full metal jackets about Vietnam.
[01:12:54.672 --> 01:12:56.232]  2001 Space Odyssey is about real things.
[01:12:56.252 --> 01:12:58.473]  You know, it's about real space travel to come.
[01:12:58.753 --> 01:13:01.654]  Dr. Strangelove is a comment about the Cold War and nuclear weapons.
[01:13:02.628 --> 01:13:08.671]  You know, everything Kubrick did was about real things that have happened, or real things that are going to happen.
[01:13:09.492 --> 01:13:15.795]  And we know that he was in high levels of the New World Order, in multiple facets.
[01:13:16.916 --> 01:13:20.277]  But no, that film, you've got the big mansion in New York.
[01:13:22.219 --> 01:13:24.220]  He goes there, these people are doing this.
[01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:26.601]  He witnesses all of this.
[01:13:27.661 --> 01:13:30.363]  But if you really watch that film, what's happening is,
[01:13:31.303 --> 01:13:34.504]  He's actually being inducted by a side gent.
[01:13:35.124 --> 01:13:36.845]  And they sidle up to you sideways.
[01:13:37.425 --> 01:13:45.647]  If you really watch the film carefully, his wife's a member, his buddy at the bar is a member, the pianist, and it's all a staged event to get him involved.
[01:13:45.908 --> 01:13:47.988]  They were already planning to kill that whore.
[01:13:49.229 --> 01:13:51.369]  Right, and that's how it dovetails in.
[01:13:51.429 --> 01:14:00.312]  Despite all the ritual, despite all the acting, basically a sacrifice was made and she ended up in a slab on the morgue.
[01:14:00.791 --> 01:14:01.972]  That's right, thanks for the call.
[01:14:02.552 --> 01:14:03.373]  Really good points.
[01:14:04.994 --> 01:14:07.456]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:14:07.516 --> 01:14:10.358]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve.
[01:14:11.199 --> 01:14:13.241]  Steve in Texas and Elizabeth and James.
[01:14:13.261 --> 01:14:13.761]  Go ahead, Steve.
[01:14:14.381 --> 01:14:21.467]  Yeah, Alex, did you hear about how the Mexican Army took a couple, came across the border, I think in New Mexico and took shots at some people?
[01:14:22.027 --> 01:14:26.050]  Yeah, I mentioned that last hour, Steve, and I'm going to cover that next at the bottom of the hour.
[01:14:26.591 --> 01:14:29.353]  There were such vicious attacks all along the border
[01:14:30.072 --> 01:14:36.855]  According to the Associated Press, that they're now fully militarized and have gone to armored vehicles, which they should have done years ago.
[01:14:36.875 --> 01:14:41.537]  You know, they'll use APCs on us, the citizens, but let the Mexican troops attack routinely.
[01:14:41.597 --> 01:14:43.237]  A major escalation, Steve.
[01:14:43.858 --> 01:14:49.360]  Why don't we, uh, I don't know if you saw Lou Dobbs last night there talk about all the Mexican consulates opening up around the country.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.801]  We ought to, uh, we ought to call a protest.
[01:14:51.861 --> 01:14:54.362]  I mean, I'd like to see you call a protest at the, uh, Austin
[01:14:54.986 --> 01:14:56.027]  Mexican Consulate.
[01:14:56.127 --> 01:14:59.929]  Well, they open and they issue IDs and they interface with local governments to take over.
[01:14:59.949 --> 01:15:01.690]  I mean, that's the official statement of the government.
[01:15:01.950 --> 01:15:02.150]  Yeah.
[01:15:02.170 --> 01:15:03.511]  And of course, the White House loves it.
[01:15:04.171 --> 01:15:04.952]  Yeah.
[01:15:05.012 --> 01:15:08.954]  I'd like to see about a hundred or a thousand people out there protesting.
[01:15:08.974 --> 01:15:12.656]  You know, protesters, fine, Steve, but I really think the protest is in the minds of the people.
[01:15:12.956 --> 01:15:13.657]  It's media.
[01:15:13.677 --> 01:15:16.839]  You know, protest is really an old form of media.
[01:15:16.919 --> 01:15:20.721]  I mean, I could write an internet story about it and a million people conservatively will read it.
[01:15:21.261 --> 01:15:37.250]  Or I can go have a protest and have some linky-dinky TV station come lie about us and not show one thing we say and then lie about us, have some other person lie about us and then... I mean, I think protesting is fine and dandy, but I mean, look, the war is on, brother!
[01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:44.194]  And let me tell you something, Americans, whether they're black, white, Hispanic, or purple, or whatever, we're taking over again.
[01:15:44.234 --> 01:15:45.135]  The people are waking up.
[01:15:45.175 --> 01:15:46.115]  The worm has turned.
[01:15:46.475 --> 01:15:47.516]  We've got the momentum.
[01:15:48.056 --> 01:15:48.976]  So let them come.
[01:15:49.016 --> 01:15:52.057]  Let the Mexican troops slaughter and kill and burn and machine gun.
[01:15:52.838 --> 01:15:57.779]  You know, in fact, the feds are having to clamp down now so it doesn't break into all-out military attack.
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:01.320]  Because then if that happens, it'll kind of put a damper on the slow takeover.
[01:16:01.621 --> 01:16:03.781]  We ought to be glad it's flaring up and getting worse.
[01:16:03.821 --> 01:16:06.462]  Like Patrick Henry said, man, the war's already going on.
[01:16:06.502 --> 01:16:07.042]  Let it come.
[01:16:07.102 --> 01:16:07.943]  Let it get bad.
[01:16:09.403 --> 01:16:11.524]  The worse it gets, the quicker the better, Steve.
[01:16:11.544 --> 01:16:12.024]  You know that.
[01:16:12.324 --> 01:16:13.204]  Yeah, that's what I say.
[01:16:13.244 --> 01:16:13.785]  Worse is better.
[01:16:16.467 --> 01:16:16.907]  Good!
[01:16:16.927 --> 01:16:18.108]  They're showing us what they are!
[01:16:18.208 --> 01:16:19.468]  Good!
[01:16:21.589 --> 01:16:26.250]  Okay, well, maybe I'll try and call one out there myself.
[01:16:27.310 --> 01:16:28.831]  I figured I'd get in the news and everything.
[01:16:28.951 --> 01:16:33.252]  Well, I mean, look, I just, the problem is, I can't do a protest right now, so I can't call one.
[01:16:34.272 --> 01:16:35.233]  Ah, protests!
[01:16:35.313 --> 01:16:36.393]  Everybody, you go out and do it.
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:39.822]  But certainly, this is Steve Mason, one of my friends.
[01:16:40.162 --> 01:16:42.484]  If you set it up, Steve, I mean, I'd be glad to plug it for him.
[01:16:42.504 --> 01:16:43.104]  I'm sure others would.
[01:16:43.524 --> 01:16:43.825]  Okay.
[01:16:44.245 --> 01:16:45.026]  Well, good enough, Alex.
[01:16:45.186 --> 01:16:46.947]  So... Vaya con Dios, compadre.
[01:16:46.967 --> 01:16:48.808]  Good to hear from you.
[01:16:50.049 --> 01:16:52.611]  Uh, yeah, I can't talk the talk and then not walk the walk.
[01:16:52.651 --> 01:16:54.212]  If I say I'm gonna have a protest, I gotta be there.
[01:16:54.993 --> 01:16:56.114]  Or go, go protest!
[01:16:56.134 --> 01:16:56.714]  Then I'm not there.
[01:16:56.754 --> 01:16:59.636]  I just... I'm trying to finish some films right now.
[01:17:00.097 --> 01:17:03.619]  Uh, and I'm trying to, uh... I'm on Coast to Coast tomorrow night.
[01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:06.982]  I like to see my family occasionally, so I just, you know...
[01:17:08.504 --> 01:17:13.845]  So it's most of the people that would show up to counter-protest us are just well-meaning idiots who don't even know what's going on.
[01:17:14.465 --> 01:17:18.206]  The media will lie so bad, I mean, I don't even know what the, you know.
[01:17:18.766 --> 01:17:25.008]  I've already protested Fox, and I've protested the Asia Stage Parade, and I'll protest again, but just not right now.
[01:17:25.028 --> 01:17:26.708]  I've had my fill of it.
[01:17:27.468 --> 01:17:31.369]  Let's go ahead and talk to, we'll go to Elizabeth in a second, James on a car phone.
[01:17:32.749 --> 01:17:34.770]  James, go ahead from Texas, you're on the air.
[01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:35.810]  Hello, Alex.
[01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:36.230]  Hi.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.661]  Hi, I'm not bringing much to the conversation.
[01:17:38.701 --> 01:17:45.585]  I just wanted to say that whenever I heard you mentioning that you're not done with the film yet and you want to do more to it, I was thrilled.
[01:17:46.065 --> 01:18:03.854]  To hear just a few things that you mentioned today about the left-right origins, and you said something a few minutes ago that was revealing to me also that I didn't know, and I would love to see the clips from Bohemian Grove Original, which I have the original tape, and that wrapped in
[01:18:05.473 --> 01:18:05.753]  Good.
[01:18:05.953 --> 01:18:17.518]  I mean, that was excellent, but like what you were saying, a full expose, what you can fit into a two or three hour DVD that goes into the history and all that of the occult, that would be so great.
[01:18:17.578 --> 01:18:19.478]  I just wanted to let you know I'm thrilled to hear that.
[01:18:19.838 --> 01:18:25.240]  When you said you're not done yet, you want to do more because of what the left side of this paradigm is getting angry.
[01:18:25.641 --> 01:18:26.741]  That's impressive.
[01:18:26.761 --> 01:18:29.382]  I just wanted to let you know that I'm impressed with that.
[01:18:29.682 --> 01:18:30.422]  Well, thank you, sir.
[01:18:30.462 --> 01:18:31.563]  I appreciate the call.
[01:18:31.963 --> 01:18:34.404]  And if you want the original Bohemian Grove video,
[01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:40.193]  It's only available for a couple more weeks, and then there'll be the new expanded one.
[01:18:40.694 --> 01:18:47.700]  But there's 20 minutes cut out of the new one, so if you want that original footage, get it now at InfoWars.com.
[01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:49.102]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:49.122 --> 01:18:49.562]  Stay with us.
[01:18:49.582 --> 01:18:50.403]  More calls straight ahead.
[01:18:54.005 --> 01:18:57.888]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[01:18:58.028 --> 01:18:59.770]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[01:18:59.850 --> 01:19:01.091]  But not just any water.
[01:19:01.191 --> 01:19:05.394]  You need Electrolyzed Iodized Water or EO from RPA Biotech.
[01:19:05.474 --> 01:19:15.162]  Drinking EO water has been noted for its ability to flush toxins, attract and neutralize free radicals, enhance the delivery of nutrients, and most importantly, supports the immune system.
[01:19:15.462 --> 01:19:21.069]  RPA Biotech's personal care products are specially formulated to kill bacteria, virus, fungus, and spores.
[01:19:21.269 --> 01:19:25.854]  Use topically to treat acne, athlete's foot, eczema, psoriasis, burned skin, rashes, and more.
[01:19:26.034 --> 01:19:29.959]  Use EO orally to treat sore throat, canker sores, and inflamed and bleeding gums.

[01:19:37.101 --> 01:19:45.503]  Hear the interview with GCN's Dr. Diegel at Nutramedical.com and for more information visit rpa-biotech.com or call 1-866-884-9104.
[01:19:45.523 --> 01:19:46.063]  That's 1-866-884-9104.
[01:19:53.792 --> 01:19:57.093]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:19:57.133 --> 01:20:01.314]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:20:01.555 --> 01:20:04.355]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:20:04.536 --> 01:20:06.936]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:20:07.136 --> 01:20:15.779]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:20:15.959 --> 01:20:17.320]  The Berkey light is different.
[01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:21.681]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:20:21.941 --> 01:20:22.441]  We're good to go!
[01:20:50.792 --> 01:20:52.320]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:20:53.698 --> 01:20:59.901]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:21:00.361 --> 01:21:08.144]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:21:08.484 --> 01:21:16.368]  Is this a flaw free enterprise, or is our monetary unit, we call the Federal Reserve Note, forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:21:16.648 --> 01:21:21.410]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:21:21.730 --> 01:21:26.434]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:21:26.955 --> 01:21:30.798]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:21:31.319 --> 01:21:32.320]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:36.484]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[01:21:41.809 --> 01:21:44.311]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:21:44.771 --> 01:21:46.452]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:46.552 --> 01:21:46.793]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:54.315 --> 01:21:55.895]  Government is best what governs least.
[01:21:56.476 --> 01:21:57.776]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:21:58.216 --> 01:22:00.917]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:22:01.357 --> 01:22:04.017]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:22:04.457 --> 01:22:10.919]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:22:31.767 --> 01:22:33.187]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[01:22:33.367 --> 01:22:33.727]  Have you?
[01:22:34.308 --> 01:22:35.828]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[01:22:36.269 --> 01:22:38.189]  Go to LibertyStickers.com or call 877-873-9626.
[01:22:38.209 --> 01:22:40.090]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[01:22:44.468 --> 01:22:45.488]  Perhaps Jenna Bush?
[01:22:46.068 --> 01:22:47.269]  Osama Bin Forgotten?
[01:22:47.709 --> 01:22:51.369]  Go to LibertyStickers.com and express your freedom of speech today.
[01:22:51.389 --> 01:23:03.512]  Alright, I'm going to talk to Elizabeth, Tim, and a few other people here.
[01:23:05.452 --> 01:23:07.973]  And then I'm going to plunge back into the news.
[01:23:07.993 --> 01:23:10.693]  MS-13 is calling for mass murder of police.
[01:23:11.054 --> 01:23:13.014]  Every cop they come in contact with.
[01:23:14.292 --> 01:23:16.053]  Of course, there's no national alert about that.
[01:23:16.693 --> 01:23:19.174]  There is a police alert, but you're not to be told about it in the public.
[01:23:19.755 --> 01:23:22.816]  Can't make our precious illegal alien drug gangs look bad.
[01:23:23.437 --> 01:23:25.858]  Mexican troops are attacking in many areas of the border.
[01:23:27.139 --> 01:23:29.160]  There's large bounties on the heads of Border Patrol.
[01:23:29.660 --> 01:23:31.201]  That's in major Mexican newspapers.
[01:23:31.381 --> 01:23:33.382]  And our media keeps that real quiet.
[01:23:33.842 --> 01:23:35.863]  Just like they keep the rocket attacks quiet.
[01:23:37.624 --> 01:23:41.566]  And they keep it real quiet how the Mexican coyotes feed on the Mexican people that are coming across.
[01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:45.192]  It is scary at many different levels.
[01:23:46.053 --> 01:23:48.375]  Right now, let's go to Elizabeth in Maryland.
[01:23:48.415 --> 01:23:49.276]  Elizabeth, welcome.
[01:23:49.756 --> 01:23:50.537]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:23:50.857 --> 01:24:04.229]  Like the caller right before me, I was on the line to say how delighted, elated, uplifted I was to hear that you're going to amplify your new DVD on the Occult Underpinnings.
[01:24:04.670 --> 01:24:09.114]  I had really been thinking about that for a couple weeks, hoping and praying that you might do that.
[01:24:09.754 --> 01:24:12.436]  And off air once I told you something that happened.
[01:24:12.936 --> 01:24:21.222]  As you know in my book I feature my father's Christian life and he once picked up a World War I veteran who had a missing leg and he could have been fired from his job.
[01:24:21.502 --> 01:24:24.004]  He was reported but God watched over him.
[01:24:24.264 --> 01:24:32.010]  Well at his funeral time there was a very elderly man who had gone to high school with him and he was talking about how he would miss him and to comfort him
[01:24:32.490 --> 01:24:35.094]  I said, well, you know he's in heaven now.
[01:24:35.114 --> 01:24:41.224]  And there was a small child standing nearby and we feared there was a satanic influence in this family.
[01:24:41.544 --> 01:24:47.854]  And the child turned and my husband and I both witnessed the child said, now she's talking about heaven!
[01:24:48.624 --> 01:24:56.772]  And Alex, I'm sort of glad that happened because anytime I doubt that heaven and hell are real, I think about that.
[01:24:57.152 --> 01:25:00.436]  Because there was opposition that we saw and we felt.
[01:25:00.456 --> 01:25:02.518]  Sounds like an adult's voice.
[01:25:02.578 --> 01:25:04.319]  Now she's talking about heaven.
[01:25:04.439 --> 01:25:05.340]  Yes, it was!
[01:25:06.241 --> 01:25:06.762]  It was!
[01:25:07.202 --> 01:25:16.431]  So I know these things are real, and last week, one of the days I had called in and talked to you and encouraged you, and I had called a minister who had not waked up yet.
[01:25:16.731 --> 01:25:27.041]  I've been giving him your materials and some other materials, and he showed great signs of waking up, and I asked him to call concerning Reverend Ted Pike's hate crimes law, and he said he would!
[01:25:27.461 --> 01:25:31.085]  And right after I talked to him, I came downstairs and I looked outside,
[01:25:31.505 --> 01:25:38.048]  And there were those beautiful majestic cardinals that God has used symbolically in my life many times.
[01:25:38.628 --> 01:25:43.470]  Seven of them a month before my father died gathered in a lilac bush at my mother's home.
[01:25:43.951 --> 01:25:44.871]  It was just beautiful.
[01:25:45.131 --> 01:25:56.276]  So Alex, I just commend you and also there are two people, maybe I don't know whether this would be appropriate for the type of DVD you make, but Constance Cumby, her book
[01:25:57.082 --> 01:26:02.483]  The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow and The Coming New Age of Barbarism.
[01:26:02.843 --> 01:26:03.544]  That book.
[01:26:03.904 --> 01:26:07.024]  She's an elderly attorney and she documented so many things.
[01:26:07.044 --> 01:26:10.325]  I think I interviewed her about 5 or 6 years ago.
[01:26:10.705 --> 01:26:14.866]  That would be wonderful to have her in the DVD because she tried... I'm just going to add a little bit more.
[01:26:14.966 --> 01:26:16.327]  I mean, I'm going to be done in a few days.
[01:26:16.407 --> 01:26:18.367]  I wish you could do an hour and a half.
[01:26:18.427 --> 01:26:24.468]  I know, but see, if I make it 10 hours long, then you know, it's... Well, whatever it is, we're going to be ready and waiting for it.
[01:26:24.548 --> 01:26:25.629]  Okay, thank you Elizabeth.
[01:26:25.689 --> 01:26:26.449]  I appreciate the call.
[01:26:27.049 --> 01:26:27.990]  Tim in Ohio.
[01:26:28.050 --> 01:26:28.951]  Tim, you're on the air.
[01:26:28.991 --> 01:26:29.311]  Welcome.
[01:26:32.894 --> 01:26:33.955]  Hello, Tim.
[01:26:34.035 --> 01:26:35.216]  Come on down.
[01:26:35.356 --> 01:26:35.796]  Tim.
[01:26:36.937 --> 01:26:37.858]  Alright, he's not there.
[01:26:38.218 --> 01:26:38.658]  Let him go.
[01:26:38.718 --> 01:26:39.959]  Who's up next in order here?
[01:26:41.861 --> 01:26:43.122]  Alright, Matthew in Texas.
[01:26:43.162 --> 01:26:43.862]  Go ahead, Matthew.
[01:26:44.243 --> 01:26:44.663]  Hey, Alex.
[01:26:44.703 --> 01:26:45.143]  How you doing?
[01:26:45.384 --> 01:26:45.664]  Good.
[01:26:47.085 --> 01:26:54.791]  It's come to my attention that it's my belief that the Bohemian Grove is a branch of the Bohemian Brothers.
[01:26:55.563 --> 01:27:00.785]  Which is a Rosicrucian order, which is mentioned in the Secret Teachings of All Ages by Manley P. Hall.
[01:27:02.186 --> 01:27:12.091]  Also, last night on the History Channel, there was a documentary about Hitler and psychics, and they brought up a lot of occultic stuff.
[01:27:13.251 --> 01:27:21.055]  They had a huge occult building in the middle of Berlin with this Jewish mystic who was there right through the war, and he was Hitler's main advisor.
[01:27:21.095 --> 01:27:23.096]  That's even been in the salon.com.
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:26.963]  Well, there is a connection here, a definite connection to Freemasonry.
[01:27:27.844 --> 01:27:32.207]  I'm not sure if you're aware of Charles W. Ledbetter, the Masonic author?
[01:27:32.608 --> 01:27:34.289]  Yes.
[01:27:35.090 --> 01:27:50.303]  It says right here in the book, Freemasonry and its Ancient Mystic Rites, that he went to India to help Helen Blavatsky, the spiritual head of the Theosophy Movement, and he talks in this book about the fifth race,
[01:27:50.908 --> 01:27:54.771]  The Teutonic Subrace of Anglo-Saxons and Scandinavians.
[01:27:55.611 --> 01:28:05.759]  So, I just wanted to point that out to you and your listeners that there is a definite connection between Freemasonry and all this Nazi occultism.
[01:28:06.199 --> 01:28:11.062]  And it's right here in this book, Freemasonry and its ancient mystic rites.
[01:28:12.984 --> 01:28:15.425]  Well, I mean, that's where the swastika comes from, is India.
[01:28:16.964 --> 01:28:18.926]  You try to explain this to people, they don't understand it.
[01:28:18.966 --> 01:28:21.428]  I mean, this is all done for a specific reason.
[01:28:21.549 --> 01:28:35.181]  The Bohemian Robe is a very complex organization, and the rituals themselves are these very intricate talismans or amulets that they design.
[01:28:36.122 --> 01:28:37.443]  And, you know, they believe in it.
[01:28:37.723 --> 01:28:38.764]  Thanks for the call.
[01:28:38.784 --> 01:28:40.326]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[01:28:43.997 --> 01:28:47.003]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.904 --> 01:28:50.589]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.725 --> 01:29:02.649]  Back in the 1950s, gasoline was only 25 cents a gallon, a hot dog was a nickel, and a luxury car was only 3,000 bucks.
[01:29:03.209 --> 01:29:04.509]  What happened to those prices?
[01:29:05.070 --> 01:29:06.750]  Well, the dollar was changed.
[01:29:08.351 --> 01:29:14.334]  In the 1960s, the government removed silver from the dollar and just started printing money out of thin air.
[01:29:14.774 --> 01:29:15.314]  The result?
[01:29:15.755 --> 01:29:17.015]  Inflation was born.
[01:29:17.515 --> 01:29:19.596]  Your dollar has lost 96% of its purchasing power.
[01:29:21.558 --> 01:29:22.442]  What can you do about it?
[01:29:22.884 --> 01:29:25.193]  Start using the Silver Liberty Dollar!
[01:29:26.019 --> 01:29:31.381]  The Silver Liberty Dollar is a private legal currency backed by 100% pure silver.
[01:29:31.801 --> 01:29:36.963]  It's 100% inflation-proof and is being used by over 100,000 people.
[01:29:37.403 --> 01:29:39.904]  Beat inflation with the Silver Liberty Dollar.
[01:29:39.924 --> 01:29:42.025]  Visit www.libertydollar.org or call 1-800-NEW-DOLLAR.
[01:29:42.045 --> 01:29:44.826]  That's libertydollar.org or call 1-800-NEW-DOLLAR now.
[01:29:53.917 --> 01:29:55.898]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[01:29:55.978 --> 01:30:06.682]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:30:07.062 --> 01:30:11.584]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:30:11.644 --> 01:30:22.988]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul tastes and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:23.568 --> 01:30:30.413]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:30:30.813 --> 01:30:32.954]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:30:33.455 --> 01:30:38.418]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post-filter elements.
[01:30:38.738 --> 01:30:44.882]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:44.902 --> 01:30:46.003]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:30:46.063 --> 01:30:46.704]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:53.288 --> 01:30:53.718]  Create.
[01:30:56.756 --> 01:30:58.217]  Sooner or later, we all have to face it.
[01:30:58.417 --> 01:31:02.359]  We live in dangerous times, and the more prepared we are, the better our chances are to survive them.
[01:31:02.639 --> 01:31:09.942]  The threat of a terrorist nuclear attack, a dirty bomb, or a nuclear power plant accident, or a nuclear waste-fill, is something we all face every day.
[01:31:10.222 --> 01:31:12.143]  That's why no family should be without the Nuke Alert.
[01:31:12.443 --> 01:31:19.226]  Small enough to fit on your keychain, the Nuke Alert monitors for dangerous radiation levels 24-7, and its long-life battery lasts for 10 years.
[01:31:19.566 --> 01:31:22.448]  It's made in the USA, and is individually accuracy-tested.
[01:31:22.648 --> 01:31:25.349]  Your Nuke Alert will let you know if you're entering a contaminated area,
[01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:28.129]  Or if you're being exposed to hazardous levels of radiation.
[01:31:28.410 --> 01:31:29.790]  Call 877-817-9829.
[01:31:30.610 --> 01:31:35.331]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your NucAlert today.
[01:31:35.631 --> 01:31:38.831]  Only $16 per year will protect your family for 10 years.
[01:31:39.191 --> 01:31:43.692]  And for a limited time, you'll also receive a CD-ROM with thousands of pages of preparedness information.
[01:31:43.972 --> 01:31:44.132]  Call 877-817-9829.
[01:31:44.152 --> 01:31:45.653]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your NucAlert today.
[01:31:45.713 --> 01:31:45.913]  NucAlert.
[01:31:46.013 --> 01:31:47.313]  Isn't your family worth it?
[01:31:56.391 --> 01:32:02.413]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:32:02.813 --> 01:32:06.034]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:07.235 --> 01:32:21.800]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight, we're here live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:23.254 --> 01:32:33.299]  Before I plunge back into the news and your phone calls, I want to invite and encourage everyone out there to not procrastinate, to get involved.
[01:32:35.039 --> 01:32:36.800]  And you're doing a great job.
[01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:52.027]  The people out there that have gotten my films, the folks that have gotten them and made copies, the truck drivers out there that are doing it, the school teachers, the college professors, the police officers, all of you, the good Americans of every
[01:32:52.890 --> 01:32:56.293]  You know, race, color, and creed, I commend you from the bottom of my heart.
[01:32:56.653 --> 01:33:13.106]  You have had just a great effect, but if you've got my videos, if you've got Martial Law, or you've got Road to Tyranny, or you've got Dark Secrets, Inside Bohemian Grove, and you've watched it, it was informative, you thought it was important, why not make a few copies?
[01:33:13.146 --> 01:33:15.708]  Why not buy another VCR, buy a DVD burner?
[01:33:15.728 --> 01:33:16.148]  They're cheap.
[01:33:17.071 --> 01:33:18.312]  Why not make some copies?
[01:33:18.352 --> 01:33:24.317]  Why not give it to the people at your Sunday school or folks down at the factory or wherever and say, hey, check out this political documentary.
[01:33:24.737 --> 01:33:25.438]  It's pretty interesting.
[01:33:25.478 --> 01:33:28.861]  Or how about going and getting an AXS TV show?
[01:33:28.901 --> 01:33:32.304]  You can go on yourself or you can put documentaries on.
[01:33:32.344 --> 01:33:42.032]  There's a sea of good films out there that people really, really need to see, that people need to be able to watch.
[01:33:43.524 --> 01:33:47.407]  And listen, folks, you know, we don't sell a hundred products here on this show.
[01:33:48.168 --> 01:33:48.508]  Okay?
[01:33:49.989 --> 01:33:53.992]  I mean, a lot of times sponsors come to me with good products and I just go, you know what?
[01:33:54.032 --> 01:33:54.773]  I don't want your money.
[01:33:55.413 --> 01:33:56.234]  Take Nuke Alert.
[01:33:57.175 --> 01:33:58.075]  I'm sure you've heard that ad.
[01:33:58.116 --> 01:34:00.657]  They came to me offering me money to promote it.
[01:34:00.678 --> 01:34:02.119]  And I said, you know, I believe in the product.
[01:34:02.139 --> 01:34:04.901]  I'll cut the spot for free and I'll run it.
[01:34:05.842 --> 01:34:11.466]  And, you know, the factory here in Texas, where you get the best price on it, has it and you can call and get it there.
[01:34:12.507 --> 01:34:12.667]  See?
[01:34:13.695 --> 01:34:17.802]  And some people will call that foolish or weird or why wouldn't you want to make money off of it?
[01:34:18.042 --> 01:34:19.765]  Because I really don't care, folks.
[01:34:20.527 --> 01:34:27.298]  As long as I have enough money to fund my operation and slowly expand what we're doing and to get the word out, I'm happy.
[01:34:28.846 --> 01:34:32.770]  And from the bottom of my heart, I want to thank all those who have supported us in many different ways.
[01:34:33.190 --> 01:34:33.691]  Thank you.
[01:34:33.731 --> 01:34:36.393]  You don't know how important your support has been.
[01:34:36.974 --> 01:34:40.957]  And if you haven't gotten Martial Law, Martial Law is my best video.
[01:34:40.997 --> 01:34:41.898]  It's a mini-series.
[01:34:42.279 --> 01:34:48.664]  It's three films on 9-11, the occult activities, the elite, and their master plan, and the latest police state developments.
[01:34:49.005 --> 01:34:49.485]  Three hours.
[01:34:49.505 --> 01:34:54.470]  A little over three hours on the DVD, over two and a half on VHS.
[01:34:55.515 --> 01:34:56.736]  Please get Martial Law.
[01:34:56.776 --> 01:34:57.876]  It's the price of one film, $25.95.
[01:34:57.996 --> 01:35:02.999]  And we got discounts on it where you can get it as low as $14 when you order multiple copies.
[01:35:03.579 --> 01:35:05.560]  American Dictators, great video we made.
[01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:07.661]  Buy one copy at the regular price, each additional $5.95.
[01:35:07.701 --> 01:35:10.182]  As many copies as you want.
[01:35:10.262 --> 01:35:11.383]  I just want to get it out to people.
[01:35:12.263 --> 01:35:14.644]  And yes, your support is needed.
[01:35:14.764 --> 01:35:18.166]  We need your support.
[01:35:18.226 --> 01:35:20.007]  We really, really do, folks.
[01:35:21.085 --> 01:35:26.868]  And I hope that you'll call and ask about the different specials and different titles and that you'll order some of the videos.

[01:37:31.367 --> 01:37:34.868]  I've had a lot of requests to play this.
[01:37:34.949 --> 01:37:35.809]  It's Dark Side.
[01:37:36.758 --> 01:37:39.480]  And it's got some interesting New World Order clips.
[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:44.503]  And just remember, who we're dealing with really is into the dark side.
[01:37:44.523 --> 01:37:47.005]  So here it is, and then we'll plunge into the news.
[01:37:49.787 --> 01:37:53.369]  You don't know the power of the dark side.
[01:38:09.203 --> 01:38:28.743]  There is a chance to use this disaster to carry out the phrase his father used, but I think only once.
[01:38:29.363 --> 01:38:31.886]  And that is a New World Order.
[01:38:42.159 --> 01:38:45.465]  The Dark Side!
[01:39:05.427 --> 01:39:16.452]  New World Order is run by absolutely ruthless individuals.
[01:39:16.572 --> 01:39:20.614]  Obsessed with total control.
[01:39:20.814 --> 01:39:28.357]  Sworn to the creation of worldwide terror.
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:37.623]  We're good to go.
[01:40:04.338 --> 01:40:07.343]  I don't care how long it takes.
[01:40:07.404 --> 01:40:14.997]  This is a larger campaign against anybody who makes a move on the world order.
[01:40:41.269 --> 01:40:43.590]  Attention, attention, attention.
[01:40:43.610 --> 01:40:50.332]  American forces are here to help.
[01:40:50.432 --> 01:40:53.233]  Remain calm.
[01:40:53.433 --> 01:41:04.036]  We will not tolerate civil disobedience.
[01:41:36.736 --> 01:41:38.879]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, welcome back.
[01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:39.901]  There is the dark side.
[01:41:39.921 --> 01:41:42.425]  Maybe one of our listeners put that together, mix that together.
[01:41:43.459 --> 01:42:12.462]  Alright, again we should pray for all the poor folks in India and Pakistan, hit by another convulsion of the planet Earth, the hurricanes, the increased tornadoes, the darkening of the planet's surface by 20% in the last three years alone, the sun's increased radiation output, massive increases in the ring of fire, the fire rim that goes around the Pacific Ocean culminating
[01:42:13.078 --> 01:42:17.162]  Of course, north of India, there in Pakistan, with the Himalayan mountains.
[01:42:18.923 --> 01:42:33.156]  Trucks of aid arrive in the ruined capital of Pakistan, Kashmir, on Tuesday, and victims scuffled for badly needed food and blankets three days after the devastating earthquake flattened whole communities
[01:42:34.488 --> 01:42:38.493]  Killing tens of thousands and leaving millions homeless.
[01:42:38.513 --> 01:42:42.638]  The government official death toll remained at slightly over 20,000 people.
[01:42:43.098 --> 01:42:47.664]  But a senior army official, not a public servant, see it's an official.
[01:42:48.678 --> 01:42:59.047]  And certainly our officials over there with the dictatorship is close to the rescue operations so that according to our assessment the death toll could be between 35,000 and 40,000 people.
[01:42:59.568 --> 01:43:07.575]  Most of the dead are in the Himalayan region of Kashmir to the official who requested anonymity as he wasn't authorized to comment or journalist about it.
[01:43:07.595 --> 01:43:08.696]  Of course not in a dictatorship.
[01:43:12.441 --> 01:43:15.263]  Continuing here, this should be simple, U.S.
[01:43:15.303 --> 01:43:21.648]  doesn't okay torture, adopt language, making that clear to the world, Des Moines Register, today!
[01:43:23.050 --> 01:43:28.054]  Does President Bush really want to be on record against language passed overwhelmingly by the U.S.
[01:43:28.094 --> 01:43:29.495]  Senate that would ban torture?
[01:43:30.115 --> 01:43:35.360]  By the 99 vote, 43 Democrats and 46 Republicans voted last week to prohibit U.S.
[01:43:35.380 --> 01:43:36.561]  soldiers from torturing prisoners.
[01:43:37.061 --> 01:43:37.962]  Not exactly true.
[01:43:38.022 --> 01:43:39.583]  I finally had time to read the bill this weekend.
[01:43:39.623 --> 01:43:41.825]  It just restricts torturing them, you know,
[01:43:42.518 --> 01:43:44.059]  To death, basically.
[01:43:44.339 --> 01:43:52.063]  Supporters included Majority Leader Bill Frist, who earlier worked against the measure, but it just would be too bad for him to be on record for it.
[01:43:52.223 --> 01:43:59.706]  It bans cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment of persons under custody or control of the United States government.
[01:44:01.107 --> 01:44:03.028]  The vote was an act of defiance.
[01:44:03.088 --> 01:44:07.770]  The White House has threatened to veto the $440 billion military spending bill.
[01:44:08.711 --> 01:44:10.852]  But half that money goes right in Dick Cheney's pocket.
[01:44:10.892 --> 01:44:11.692]  How would he veto that?
[01:44:14.235 --> 01:44:15.836]  The vote was an act of defiance.
[01:44:15.876 --> 01:44:23.758]  The White House was threatened to veto a $440 billion military spending bill if it included the amendment to ban torture.
[01:44:25.339 --> 01:44:39.562]  It supposedly would interfere with Bush's ability to conduct the war on terrorism as if torture or threat of torture is deterrent to an enemy or in keeping with an image of America once had as a nation that sets a high standard for human treatment.
[01:44:41.023 --> 01:44:41.783]  And it goes on.
[01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:43.941]  Folks, come on!
[01:44:44.641 --> 01:44:47.684]  They've put people in prison for years!
[01:44:47.704 --> 01:44:54.750]  They're getting, you know, five years in prison for beating people and hooking electrodes to them and doing all this.
[01:44:56.532 --> 01:44:59.834]  And notice the Feds have only allowed prosecutions for the really petty stuff.
[01:44:59.875 --> 01:45:07.261]  I mean, what England did, what Grainer did, frankly, isn't a third of what some of the other people did.
[01:45:09.278 --> 01:45:16.242]  I mean, it's admitted, beating people to death, raping women, I mean, raping underage women and boys.
[01:45:17.303 --> 01:45:19.504]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[01:45:19.604 --> 01:45:26.428]  Can you imagine being picked up at a checkpoint, taken to a camp, and there's a bunch of Americans in there, and they start raping your wife in front of you?
[01:45:27.348 --> 01:45:31.310]  I mean, you know, this, we got to invade and attack Saddam, he's got rape rooms.
[01:45:33.952 --> 01:45:37.934]  By the way, I know I just sprung this on you, can you find the Limbaugh clip where he says they're just blowing off steam?
[01:45:39.512 --> 01:45:43.015]  And it's kind of a Freudian slip by Limbaugh, because he's definitely an insider.
[01:45:43.455 --> 01:45:46.317]  He says, uh, just like it's skull and bones.
[01:45:48.999 --> 01:45:54.824]  See, all this is very, very, very, very serious.
[01:45:57.365 --> 01:46:00.868]  And it has to be taken very, very, very seriously.
[01:46:03.330 --> 01:46:06.032]  But, how do people go to prison?
[01:46:06.596 --> 01:46:14.701]  When we have their orders, and the memos, and the White House saying it, and then the White House says, no, we're not involved in it, and then the White House says, I vetoed, you can't torture.
[01:46:15.521 --> 01:46:18.163]  I mean, it just shows how they're behind it all, they're doing it all.
[01:46:18.843 --> 01:46:22.366]  I mean, Alberto Gonzalez, four of his memos are public, that contain torture.
[01:46:22.966 --> 01:46:27.629]  And he says, if we just change the name and don't call it torture, we can pressure someone until they die.
[01:46:28.369 --> 01:46:29.410]  I mean, those are quotes.
[01:46:30.090 --> 01:46:31.111]  We can table them.
[01:46:32.265 --> 01:46:38.350]  uh... which is grounding you they put you on a plank and they slot you ever seen conspiracy theory with Mel Gibson?
[01:46:38.770 --> 01:47:00.065]  They did their research for that that's how they torture you you know where they dunk him on the stretcher into the water up to his chest now that in the movie that's not it's not feces and urine tabling in the CIA manual is you have the interrogators for several days it's just a pot of rotten water and uh... they defecate and urinate in it
[01:47:01.482 --> 01:47:07.045]  And they dunk you in that, and you inhale that, and of course, well that's to save our troops!
[01:47:08.245 --> 01:47:09.046]  Never did that before.
[01:47:09.386 --> 01:47:11.087]  North Vietnamese were bad doing that to our troops.
[01:47:11.107 --> 01:47:12.247]  Didn't North Vietnamese table.
[01:47:13.808 --> 01:47:16.189]  And can you trust a government that does that?
[01:47:16.249 --> 01:47:17.650]  No, you can't trust confessions.
[01:47:18.030 --> 01:47:19.371]  Look, I'll tell you whatever you want.
[01:47:20.237 --> 01:47:21.078]  After they're done doing it.
[01:47:21.318 --> 01:47:22.299]  But that's not all they do.
[01:47:22.319 --> 01:47:24.280]  They table people, and then they beat them to death.
[01:47:24.300 --> 01:47:28.263]  They pick up local Iraqi doctors who've been reporting on how they've been shooting people.
[01:47:28.324 --> 01:47:29.364]  Oh, you told Reuters!
[01:47:29.885 --> 01:47:31.446]  You talked to a Reuters cameraman!
[01:47:31.506 --> 01:47:32.247]  Come with us!
[01:47:33.087 --> 01:47:33.868]  This has been in the news.
[01:47:33.928 --> 01:47:46.598]  And then they throw the guy out by his house, beaten to death with burns all over his chest, on his, uh, you know, on his breast, on his, uh, you know, the male breast.
[01:47:47.458 --> 01:47:48.338]  On the genitalia?
[01:47:48.778 --> 01:47:52.019]  We have these fellas on the website that just burns all over, just burned off.
[01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:56.341]  Cigarette burns, cigar burns, just purple bruises all over his body.
[01:47:56.761 --> 01:47:57.621]  Teeth knocked out.
[01:47:58.721 --> 01:48:02.182]  Imagine, they just strap him down and start, uh, uh, uh, give me that cigar.
[01:48:03.923 --> 01:48:06.444]  You're not going to talk to the reporters anymore, are you?
[01:48:06.964 --> 01:48:11.145]  Uh, uh, uh, uh, just beating them for hours until they expire.
[01:48:13.482 --> 01:48:14.483]  That's freedom.
[01:48:15.043 --> 01:48:16.284]  That's Christianity.
[01:48:16.384 --> 01:48:17.905]  That's what the good guys do.
[01:48:19.386 --> 01:48:19.686]  Sick!
[01:48:20.906 --> 01:48:21.507]  Here's another one.
[01:48:22.187 --> 01:48:24.328]  Prison guards enjoy torture.
[01:48:25.349 --> 01:48:33.854]  An Egyptian man released earlier this month from the United States detention, when Hannibal Bae Cuba says the torture he suffered in the military camp left him crippled in a wheelchair.
[01:48:34.855 --> 01:48:36.996]  Well, they had Marines.
[01:48:39.315 --> 01:48:47.839]  Dressed up like Arabs and they would do fake deliveries of them for quote training and those guys are suing one of them can't even get out of a wheelchair when they beat him so bad.
[01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:50.741]  I mean this is sick folks.
[01:48:52.342 --> 01:48:57.824]  Sammy Al Leffy 49 said they used to grab me by the arms and hurl me on the floor on my back.
[01:48:58.184 --> 01:49:00.506]  They took pleasure in torturing us.
[01:49:00.546 --> 01:49:03.187]  He said I've suffered a fracture in my back bone because of this.
[01:49:04.002 --> 01:49:10.605]  He was held for years, for four years in the U.S.-run jail in Guantanamo before his release and hand over to the Egyptian authorities in early October.
[01:49:11.125 --> 01:49:14.447]  Medical companies and doctors certify.
[01:49:15.467 --> 01:49:17.508]  And it goes into all the things that were wrong with him.
[01:49:18.869 --> 01:49:19.910]  Daily beatings.
[01:49:20.750 --> 01:49:23.071]  Body slamming him into the concrete daily.
[01:49:24.412 --> 01:49:25.212]  That's friendly.
[01:49:26.493 --> 01:49:27.633]  And you think you're safe.
[01:49:27.733 --> 01:49:30.855]  You think all these troops are going to come back and they're going to be cops.
[01:49:32.095 --> 01:49:33.316]  The government knows it's full well.
[01:49:35.007 --> 01:49:36.408]  And, uh, heaven help us.
[01:49:36.428 --> 01:49:39.630]  They're gonna turn them loose on us.
[01:49:39.690 --> 01:49:41.611]  Man, you saw what happened if you take photos.
[01:49:41.832 --> 01:49:43.473]  Answer is don't take photos!
[01:49:44.493 --> 01:49:45.034]  Yes, sir!
[01:49:45.054 --> 01:49:45.594]  Yes, sir!

[01:50:12.083 --> 01:50:14.064]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:50:14.264 --> 01:50:17.106]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:17.206 --> 01:50:21.869]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:22.069 --> 01:50:26.492]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.712 --> 01:50:33.936]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:51:48.530 --> 01:51:49.070]  We're good to go.
[01:52:10.979 --> 01:52:11.359]  I think so.
[01:52:31.834 --> 01:52:35.255]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:04.750 --> 01:53:07.872]  Yeah, I want to roll this Limbaugh clip, then I'll get into some other news.
[01:53:08.913 --> 01:53:12.415]  Because it... Understand, they're still on the radio.
[01:53:12.475 --> 01:53:13.556]  I hear neocons all the time.
[01:53:14.157 --> 01:53:15.598]  Saying there's no torture going on.
[01:53:15.778 --> 01:53:17.499]  Oh, Club Gitmo, it's so much fun.
[01:53:18.319 --> 01:53:24.964]  And they focus on people dressed up in women's clothes, or people dressed up, you know, naked or whatever, and... Oh, it's just fun.
[01:53:24.984 --> 01:53:31.429]  Of course, they don't mention the pool of blood by the pile of naked men, you know, it's... This is what psychopaths always do.
[01:53:31.509 --> 01:53:33.410]  It's like a sexual thing is added into it.
[01:53:34.190 --> 01:53:35.811]  Charlie Manson type activities.
[01:53:35.851 --> 01:53:38.011]  But, oh, it's so Christian and conservative.
[01:53:38.051 --> 01:53:38.571]  No, it's not.
[01:53:39.612 --> 01:53:40.792]  You're of your father, the devil.
[01:53:42.153 --> 01:53:44.033]  But, uh, they make these jokes about it.
[01:53:44.073 --> 01:53:47.254]  Meanwhile, the Army's own report says, yeah, raping women.
[01:53:47.354 --> 01:53:47.594]  Mm-hmm.
[01:53:48.274 --> 01:53:48.995]  From other husbands.
[01:53:49.015 --> 01:53:49.315]  Yeah.
[01:53:50.535 --> 01:53:53.576]  Putting acid on objects and then doing things with them, folks.
[01:53:53.776 --> 01:53:54.116]  Acid.
[01:53:54.656 --> 01:53:56.037]  Raping people with acid.
[01:53:57.417 --> 01:53:57.717]  Okay?
[01:53:58.718 --> 01:53:59.578]  And that's your government.
[01:54:00.298 --> 01:54:02.639]  I mean, that's Jeffrey... Jeffrey Dahmer actually did that.
[01:54:03.493 --> 01:54:03.733]  Okay?
[01:54:04.234 --> 01:54:05.615]  They're doing Jeffrey Dahmer things.
[01:54:06.135 --> 01:54:07.976]  Now, either Jeffrey Dahmer's good or he's bad.
[01:54:08.517 --> 01:54:13.601]  Because if Jeffrey Dahmer's bad, which, in our moral system, he's bad, then these troops are evil.
[01:54:13.861 --> 01:54:14.801]  But who's more evil?
[01:54:14.942 --> 01:54:16.443]  The guy that did it or those that sent them?
[01:54:17.023 --> 01:54:18.604]  Our government gave these orders.
[01:54:20.706 --> 01:54:24.849]  And then openly says they're not going to stop doing it, and then they don't get in trouble, but people go to prison.
[01:54:26.770 --> 01:54:32.855]  And when they get caught doing it, it's like they used the Patriot Act to strip one of the torturer's rights, who beat some people to death in Afghanistan.
[01:54:35.268 --> 01:54:38.569]  And then he wanted to speak out, and they slapped the Patriot Act on him to shut up.
[01:54:39.109 --> 01:54:40.590]  I mean, you know, this is incredible.
[01:54:41.250 --> 01:54:42.010]  This is incredible.
[01:54:43.011 --> 01:54:46.012]  So I don't want to hear they're not using the Patriot Act in non-terror-related cases.
[01:54:46.212 --> 01:54:47.953]  They use it on their own torture goons!
[01:54:48.213 --> 01:54:48.793]  Here's Limbaugh.
[01:54:50.333 --> 01:54:51.994]  What's psychologically wrong with that?
[01:54:52.414 --> 01:54:59.936]  It's not the act so much, it was like a college fraternity prank to stack up naked men and... Exactly!
[01:55:00.216 --> 01:55:01.917]  Exactly my point!
[01:55:02.217 --> 01:55:13.040]  This is no different than what happens at the Skull and Bones initiation, and we're going to ruin people's lives over it, and we're going to hamper our military effort, and then we're going to really hamper them because they had a good time.
[01:55:16.178 --> 01:55:18.259]  These people are being fired at every day.
[01:55:18.339 --> 01:55:19.800]  I'm talking about the people having a good time.
[01:55:20.100 --> 01:55:22.582]  These people... You ever heard of emotional release?
[01:55:23.642 --> 01:55:25.584]  You ever heard of needing to blow some steam off?
[01:55:26.644 --> 01:55:38.911]  Folks, God forbid your 18-year-old daughter doesn't get kidnapped sometime by goons and thrown in a van and raped by, you know, 15 people like just happened last week with a bunch of illegal aliens.
[01:55:39.271 --> 01:55:45.275]  God forbid a psychopath doesn't get her and then torture her and then slit her throat because, uh,
[01:55:46.127 --> 01:55:48.368]  Maybe they're defensively, they were just blowing off some steam.
[01:55:50.388 --> 01:55:53.269]  Now, he said that months after it had been all over the news.
[01:55:54.010 --> 01:55:57.331]  The Togumbo report, the Army report, all of it.
[01:55:57.391 --> 01:55:58.971]  And I hear people, ah, so what?
[01:55:59.471 --> 01:56:01.132]  Them ragheads ain't human.
[01:56:01.152 --> 01:56:07.974]  Notice that the only type of racism that's allowed is calling Arabs bad names.
[01:56:09.645 --> 01:56:12.086]  And, uh, you know, the Arabs are going to get us, they're going to get us.
[01:56:12.106 --> 01:56:12.706]  Let me tell you something.
[01:56:12.726 --> 01:56:14.826]  The radical Muslims are globalist controlled.
[01:56:15.147 --> 01:56:17.027]  Our government created and radicalized them.
[01:56:17.047 --> 01:56:17.527]  It's a fact!
[01:56:18.588 --> 01:56:21.768]  So you can all run from the hills, you know, from the Muslims proselytizing.
[01:56:21.828 --> 01:56:23.129]  I'm certainly not pushing Islam.
[01:56:23.569 --> 01:56:27.610]  But the point is, is that the globalists... Look at the Masons, man.
[01:56:27.650 --> 01:56:29.471]  They got their... their shriners.
[01:56:29.491 --> 01:56:30.831]  They worship at the Shrine of Allah.
[01:56:32.671 --> 01:56:35.852]  This is who Werder Busch has met as a member of an organization that worships Allah.
[01:56:35.872 --> 01:56:38.373]  That's why he can go to a shrine and worship Allah.
[01:56:39.815 --> 01:56:42.177]  Look, these guys are not playing games.
[01:56:42.418 --> 01:56:44.059]  And I just hope everybody realizes that.
[01:56:44.159 --> 01:56:45.160]  And none of us are safe.
[01:56:45.681 --> 01:56:50.706]  When Bush can get up on TV and say, I'm going to veto that law, the torture continues.
[01:56:51.206 --> 01:56:52.407]  And Limbaugh is calling it fun.
[01:56:53.728 --> 01:57:02.517]  I mean, for anybody whose mother or daughter or husband has been kidnapped and tortured, or who's had anything bad happen to them, been mugged, been shot,
[01:57:03.248 --> 01:57:05.349]  Then whatever, I mean, you know, it happens every year.
[01:57:05.389 --> 01:57:09.451]  A couple times a year here in Austin, some guy breaks in, rapes a woman, stabs her to death.
[01:57:09.471 --> 01:57:13.954]  Can you imagine if a local talk show got on the air and said, oh, the guy was just blowing off steam?
[01:57:15.695 --> 01:57:17.175]  I mean, that's what he's saying!
[01:57:19.977 --> 01:57:22.158]  No, I want the neocon listeners out there.
[01:57:22.778 --> 01:57:23.679]  I want to hear you say it.
[01:57:24.759 --> 01:57:25.880]  Just say all this is good.
[01:57:25.980 --> 01:57:27.261]  Say Joseph Mingle is good.
[01:57:27.841 --> 01:57:29.021]  Say Jeffrey Dahmer's good.
[01:57:29.322 --> 01:57:31.703]  Third Hour, Tons of News, your call's coming up, Ron Paul too.
[01:57:33.470 --> 01:57:38.359]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.827 --> 01:57:50.467]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.127 --> 01:57:52.227]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.908 --> 01:57:54.108]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.668 --> 01:57:55.488]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.229 --> 01:57:57.769]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.809 --> 01:58:01.630]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.990 --> 01:58:06.112]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.612 --> 01:58:12.874]  Well, there's big time talk when you turn on the new shows of Indictments in the Bush White House.
[01:58:14.111 --> 01:58:20.033]  High-level officials, authorities, not servants, but our officials, our gods.
[01:58:21.813 --> 01:58:32.596]  And there's all sorts of news about martial law and preparations for it and this big fat police state and what's happening with the economy and the dollar and oil prices.
[01:58:33.396 --> 01:58:38.338]  Congressman Ron Paul will be joining us in 29 minutes or so.
[01:58:40.003 --> 01:58:42.364]  He'll be joining us to talk about a host of issues.
[01:58:42.844 --> 01:58:46.605]  We always look forward to the numero uno member of Congress, one of the few good people there.
[01:58:47.366 --> 01:58:50.727]  He is even heads above the other people that are half-decent in Congress.
[01:58:51.207 --> 01:58:52.827]  Heads, shoulders, you name it, above them.
[01:58:54.008 --> 01:59:02.351]  So the very busy Congressman will take out time, as he does every few months, to give us a legislative update on several issues, including the Hate Crimes Bill, coming up in 30 minutes.
[01:59:03.618 --> 01:59:07.299]  We're going to take Coles in the next 30 minutes and cover a bunch of other news.
[01:59:07.739 --> 01:59:08.939]  What's happening with the border.
[01:59:09.019 --> 01:59:10.700]  They're now having to put armored vehicles down there.
[01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:12.820]  A lot of stuff happening right now.
[01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:16.301]  Ken and then Radkin and Brock and Steve.
[01:59:16.661 --> 01:59:18.402]  Ken and KC, you're on the air.
[01:59:24.183 --> 01:59:24.683]  He's gone.
[01:59:24.763 --> 01:59:25.383]  Let him go.
[01:59:25.563 --> 01:59:26.864]  Radkin in Vermont.
[01:59:26.944 --> 01:59:27.824]  Radkin, go ahead.
[01:59:29.124 --> 01:59:29.884]  Yes, Alex.
[01:59:30.165 --> 01:59:31.965]  I'm very humbled and don't even...
[01:59:32.794 --> 01:59:45.383]  I don't know what to say at this moment, but this morning, listening to your show, there was digital interruption in your... in the words, and I noticed that also on the Power Hour when they were talking about Hurricane Katrina.
[01:59:46.124 --> 01:59:47.665]  In other words... Well, how are you listening, sir?
[01:59:47.685 --> 01:59:49.326]  Um, on shortwave.
[01:59:51.748 --> 01:59:52.849]  On shortwave radio, Alex.
[01:59:53.069 --> 01:59:55.711]  Yeah, well, I think they're on different frequencies than I am, sir.
[01:59:55.791 --> 01:59:59.374]  Well, yeah, they are on different frequencies, but it was the same type of
[01:59:59.898 --> 02:00:03.399]  Digital interruption, like parts of the words would be cut out.
[02:00:03.699 --> 02:00:10.201]  And I didn't know if that was technology that you knew was being used to jam during critical information.
[02:00:10.221 --> 02:00:11.462]  Nah, it's probably us.
[02:00:13.522 --> 02:00:16.163]  I mean, certainly we've been jammed before.
[02:00:16.263 --> 02:00:19.864]  One time we had Voice of America follow us around on the dial.
[02:00:20.304 --> 02:00:22.505]  We would move frequencies and they'd follow us around.
[02:00:23.166 --> 02:00:25.809]  And you know, it could be that, but Lord knows what's happening.
[02:00:25.889 --> 02:00:26.911]  I really don't know.
[02:00:27.151 --> 02:00:28.593]  Let me just ask you this, too.
[02:00:28.693 --> 02:00:38.865]  I called up last week to see, because I know you've mentioned just when you were talking about your specials, and that if you bought two or three or something,
[02:00:39.358 --> 02:00:42.459]  It's got the price down to $5.95 or something like that?
[02:00:42.699 --> 02:00:46.480]  Yeah, I'm doing that with American Dictators, documenting the staged election of 2004.
[02:00:46.600 --> 02:00:51.302]  It's in the Skull and Bones, and Bush and Kerry being cousins, and a lot of other 9-11 issues.
[02:00:51.382 --> 02:00:52.202]  It's a good video.
[02:00:52.702 --> 02:00:54.403]  And you buy one for $19.95.
[02:00:54.483 --> 02:00:55.523]  Each additional of that is $5.95.
[02:00:55.683 --> 02:00:57.204]  Let me ask you this.
[02:00:57.224 --> 02:01:02.786]  Do you have any special offer if one just wants to get every work you've ever produced?
[02:01:02.866 --> 02:01:06.607]  Like, you've got, what, 10 or 11 videos now, and a couple books?
[02:01:06.647 --> 02:01:06.967]  Twelve.
[02:01:07.549 --> 02:01:08.490]  Well, you know what?
[02:01:08.510 --> 02:01:09.290]  That's a great idea.
[02:01:09.330 --> 02:01:11.111]  People keep recommending that, and I will do that.
[02:01:11.131 --> 02:01:13.033]  There will be a special up there by tomorrow.
[02:01:13.453 --> 02:01:14.894]  A huge discount if you get everything.
[02:01:15.434 --> 02:01:16.255]  That's what I'd love.
[02:01:16.495 --> 02:01:19.397]  That's what I'd love, because... Okay, thank you very much.
[02:01:19.417 --> 02:01:20.237]  No, no.
[02:01:20.317 --> 02:01:21.138]  Thank you, Redken.
[02:01:21.158 --> 02:01:23.479]  I appreciate your holding, and I appreciate your support, sir.
[02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:25.500]  Believe me, and we really do appreciate it.
[02:01:25.521 --> 02:01:26.301]  We put it to good use.
[02:01:26.741 --> 02:01:29.043]  Brock, up north in Canada.
[02:01:29.103 --> 02:01:29.703]  Welcome, Brock.
[02:01:30.023 --> 02:01:30.844]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:01:31.024 --> 02:01:32.465]  I wanted to ask you about
[02:01:32.984 --> 02:01:39.789]  Hurricane Katrina, if you think possibly there was weather modification to manipulate any of that?
[02:01:39.809 --> 02:01:49.197]  Well, you know, I cover what I can prove, but we've had meteorologists and others on who say there was clear evidence that it was being manipulated, and we know the technology does exist, but again, I don't know.
[02:01:49.717 --> 02:01:51.398]  Yeah, and the other thing is, what...
[02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:54.861]  What were they trying to prove?
[02:01:55.041 --> 02:01:57.721]  I mean, FEMA was just the enemy in that.
[02:01:57.781 --> 02:01:59.342]  Well, it's always multifaceted.
[02:01:59.402 --> 02:02:03.663]  The globalists will get tens of billions of dollars in contracts out of it.
[02:02:04.283 --> 02:02:06.423]  Hundreds of billions, not tens of billions.
[02:02:07.323 --> 02:02:16.305]  And actually, FEMA, by screwing up and cutting police lines, and I was talking to an emergency medical worker yesterday who was there that would talk about, you know, FEMA sabotaging.
[02:02:16.325 --> 02:02:18.966]  I mean, the cops, the cops have been on national TV saying,
[02:02:19.705 --> 02:02:20.846]  Saying that they sabotage.
[02:02:21.327 --> 02:02:24.649]  Hey, let's stay there, Brock, and I'll explain when we get back.
[02:02:25.230 --> 02:02:27.632]  You can give me your take on it, and we'll talk to Steve and a few others.
[02:02:28.032 --> 02:02:39.402]  But I'm going to talk to Brock and Steve, I'm going to cover news, we'll take a few more calls, and then good old Congressman Ron Paul, joining us, coming up in about 25 minutes.
[02:02:39.422 --> 02:02:42.645]  Don't forget the websites, InfoWars.com and InfoWars.net.
[02:02:45.436 --> 02:02:46.938]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:47.118 --> 02:02:50.201]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:50.341 --> 02:02:54.244]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:54.284 --> 02:02:58.529]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:02:58.869 --> 02:03:02.632]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:02.773 --> 02:03:04.654]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:04.774 --> 02:03:08.098]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:03:08.138 --> 02:03:09.219]  The medical bills!
[02:03:10.820 --> 02:03:12.841]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:12.981 --> 02:03:16.023]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:03:16.203 --> 02:03:19.085]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:03:19.566 --> 02:03:25.670]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:26.210 --> 02:03:30.012]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:04:50.017 --> 02:04:56.019]  You can lose excess weight, have more energy, sleep better, and be mentally on top of your game without even trying.
[02:04:56.039 --> 02:04:59.780]  This is not about vitamins or the latest nutritional wonder product.
[02:04:59.820 --> 02:05:01.041]  We've all had enough of those.
[02:05:01.281 --> 02:05:04.002]  I'm talking about God's pure, whole food.
[02:05:04.042 --> 02:05:06.862]  When you consume them, you look and feel better automatically.
[02:05:06.942 --> 02:05:11.524]  And thanks to URI International, you don't have to endure tasteless food or the expensive
[02:05:11.704 --> 02:05:12.364]  We're good to go.
[02:05:39.477 --> 02:05:39.577]  888-224-7416.
[02:05:40.557 --> 02:05:43.778]  That's 888-224-7416.
[02:05:45.239 --> 02:05:50.300]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.660 --> 02:05:52.941]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:52.961 --> 02:05:57.822]  All right, Ron Paul, Connors is coming up here in about 25 minutes.
[02:05:58.642 --> 02:05:59.182]  Ton of news.
[02:05:59.262 --> 02:06:01.683]  I'm just going to talk to Brock and Steve and then get back into the news.
[02:06:03.386 --> 02:06:06.367]  Brock said, you know, why did FEMA screw up so bad?
[02:06:06.407 --> 02:06:07.628]  I mean, how does that help them?
[02:06:07.668 --> 02:06:08.808]  And I mean, I'll answer that question.
[02:06:10.989 --> 02:06:13.370]  The war on drugs is a complete, total failure.
[02:06:13.690 --> 02:06:15.070]  At least on the surface reasons.
[02:06:15.571 --> 02:06:19.252]  Oh, the war on drugs is to keep your kids off heroin and cocaine and keep you safe.
[02:06:20.092 --> 02:06:27.175]  But wait a minute, the government's been caught hundreds of times on airfields where the local cops come bust them and it's CIA guys
[02:06:28.291 --> 02:06:31.913]  Or DEA with, you know, jet loads of cocaine and heroin.
[02:06:31.933 --> 02:06:39.917]  They just flash national ID card, you know, federal police cards, and the cops still hold them, and they get a presidential order to release them.
[02:06:39.957 --> 02:06:40.998]  National security.
[02:06:42.579 --> 02:06:51.604]  It happens all... I mean, they found 18 wheelers full of cocaine on the Texas border, and then the FBI comes and snatches it from Border Patrol and says, it's our load, shut up, let our driver go.
[02:06:51.644 --> 02:06:52.004]  I mean, it's...
[02:06:53.777 --> 02:06:56.179]  The drug war is about going after their competition.
[02:06:56.699 --> 02:06:58.340]  It's about setting up a police state.
[02:06:58.400 --> 02:07:04.625]  It's about filling the private prisons that are owned by the same drug dealing families with your kids that are dumb enough to use them.
[02:07:05.105 --> 02:07:07.887]  And then Dudley Do-Right cop pulls them over and finds the drugs.
[02:07:09.768 --> 02:07:17.454]  It's about generating a sustained crime wave because junkies will steal to get money, which then again goes directly into the pockets of the globalists.
[02:07:17.474 --> 02:07:18.895]  So it's really a hidden tax.
[02:07:20.689 --> 02:07:21.610]  And it's big, big business.
[02:07:21.990 --> 02:07:25.032]  So the war on drugs is a great success, if you really know the real reason for it.
[02:07:25.693 --> 02:07:28.615]  Well, if FEMA had gone in and done a great job, there wouldn't have been a problem.
[02:07:29.175 --> 02:07:32.477]  Would they be able to call now for total military occupation of the U.S.?
[02:07:32.918 --> 02:07:34.539]  They'd be able to call for unlimited power.
[02:07:34.679 --> 02:07:36.020]  FEMA already had unlimited power.
[02:07:36.140 --> 02:07:37.441]  It's just unconstitutional.
[02:07:38.962 --> 02:07:40.643]  They now have to legitimize its use.
[02:07:40.703 --> 02:07:45.166]  So why did FEMA jam police communications from the hour the hurricane hit?
[02:07:45.427 --> 02:07:46.848]  They were there jamming them.
[02:07:47.468 --> 02:07:49.049]  They had military jamming systems.
[02:07:49.069 --> 02:07:50.190]  This is like mainstream news.
[02:07:51.107 --> 02:07:55.291]  Jamming the police so two-thirds of the cops walk off the job.
[02:07:56.732 --> 02:07:57.092]  Okay?
[02:07:57.512 --> 02:07:58.573]  Two-thirds walk off.
[02:08:00.255 --> 02:08:04.078]  Then FEMA runs around all over the state cutting down police towers.
[02:08:04.118 --> 02:08:12.104]  I mean, they'd go, cops would see a van pulled up at the transmitter tower for the police radio, which is a very good system, and they'd go, what's going on there?
[02:08:12.905 --> 02:08:17.909]  And they'd pull over and the guys would flash FEMA badges and they'd be, you know, guys with high and tight haircuts with a submachine gun.
[02:08:19.025 --> 02:08:20.626]  And then FEMA would say, we're in control here.
[02:08:20.667 --> 02:08:21.127]  Back off!
[02:08:21.167 --> 02:08:21.687]  Back off!
[02:08:22.608 --> 02:08:23.789]  And well, why are you cutting it?
[02:08:23.849 --> 02:08:26.212]  I mean, you know, if you're in control, just tell us not to use it.
[02:08:27.713 --> 02:08:32.097]  And then finally, police in three different parishes posted armed guards to protect the communications.
[02:08:32.157 --> 02:08:35.280]  I mean, FEMA was caught blocking boats, blocking police, blocking water.
[02:08:36.024 --> 02:08:41.647]  FEMA had water there, you know, a day into the Superdome disaster, but had the troops hold the people back and not give them the water.
[02:08:42.187 --> 02:08:42.988]  This is all admitted.
[02:08:43.048 --> 02:08:43.328]  Why?
[02:08:43.368 --> 02:08:49.151]  Because if you have images of Bedlam, if you have images of Breckdown, then you get this call for more power and control.
[02:08:49.631 --> 02:08:51.913]  By screwing up, they get more!
[02:08:53.774 --> 02:08:55.655]  So, I mean, that's, now that's what's happened.
[02:08:56.195 --> 02:09:01.318]  And it turns out there were very little looters, very little crime, only a few shootings,
[02:09:02.060 --> 02:09:07.082]  It was all hyped up to again create this Bush's securities number one.
[02:09:07.102 --> 02:09:08.663]  We need to get rid of posse commentatus.
[02:09:09.363 --> 02:09:11.904]  Which, they don't need to get rid of posse commentatus to have troops in there.
[02:09:12.944 --> 02:09:14.825]  If the governor calls them in during an emergency.
[02:09:16.606 --> 02:09:22.248]  But they want to get rid of it because the troops have been training quietly to run our lives for over 15 years.
[02:09:23.088 --> 02:09:24.449]  Brock, does that answer your question?
[02:09:25.069 --> 02:09:26.990]  It does and somewhat.
[02:09:27.110 --> 02:09:28.991]  You know, I was just wondering if there was a
[02:09:29.861 --> 02:09:49.886]  You know, a plan from these occultists to target the black people, because they sure did that in Africa, you know, displacing them, and they're a bunch of sickos that I think are high-level Aryans, you know, and I wondered if that played into it, like, let's target and abuse the black people.
[02:09:51.206 --> 02:09:52.386]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[02:09:53.767 --> 02:09:55.207]  You know, that's the enigma.
[02:09:55.927 --> 02:09:58.808]  That's this alchemy the globalists engage in, political alchemy.
[02:09:59.463 --> 02:10:01.204]  Or creative destruction as they call it.
[02:10:01.864 --> 02:10:10.587]  A lady walked up to me last night at the movie showing and she said, she said, Alex, she said, I don't get this.
[02:10:11.527 --> 02:10:18.949]  The Zionists are involved, the Nazis are involved, there's all these groups involved, and why would the Zionists and the Nazis work together?
[02:10:20.170 --> 02:10:21.410]  I mean, it's in their own documents.
[02:10:21.430 --> 02:10:23.751]  This is like, again, this is in major newspapers.
[02:10:23.811 --> 02:10:26.052]  Major books have been written by professors about this.
[02:10:26.112 --> 02:10:26.772]  Jewish professors.
[02:10:27.523 --> 02:10:29.825]  This is in the Jewish newspapers in Israel.
[02:10:31.026 --> 02:10:34.028]  Big factions, the dominant factions of the Zionists.
[02:10:34.048 --> 02:10:35.509]  There's really three factions.
[02:10:36.209 --> 02:10:40.453]  But the big dominant faction was into the occult too.
[02:10:41.593 --> 02:10:44.095]  And they were in the same secret societies as Hitler.
[02:10:45.216 --> 02:10:52.281]  And they wanted to persecute and do that to Jews to make Jews leave Germany and areas of Europe to make them go to Israel.
[02:10:52.782 --> 02:10:55.844]  And they wrote books and they praised Hitler.
[02:10:57.365 --> 02:11:11.275]  Kurt Nemo, you know, when I got attacked by Jewish Review Magazine, Kurt Nemo went to my defense and dug up all the mainstream news articles and documents and I appreciate that and put together a big, like, ten-page article that's full of hyperlinks to mainstream news admitting it.
[02:11:12.656 --> 02:11:14.016]  So, see, this stuff doesn't make sense.
[02:11:14.036 --> 02:11:16.938]  You know, the government wants to have the drug war fail.
[02:11:16.958 --> 02:11:20.861]  The government wants to fail in New Orleans.
[02:11:20.901 --> 02:11:22.882]  The government, you know, wants disease to spread.
[02:11:22.902 --> 02:11:23.583]  The government wants to
[02:11:25.461 --> 02:11:27.603]  This is how they get their control and end it.
[02:11:31.565 --> 02:11:33.547]  Throughout history, elites have been corrupt.
[02:11:33.567 --> 02:11:36.709]  It doesn't matter if they're Chinese, or Jewish, or German, or English.
[02:11:37.209 --> 02:11:38.510]  Elites tend to be corrupt.
[02:11:38.550 --> 02:11:40.532]  In fact, more than ten, they almost always are.
[02:11:44.014 --> 02:11:46.256]  I mean, it's like Hitler worked with the Japanese.
[02:11:46.316 --> 02:11:47.356]  They were his big buddies.
[02:11:48.717 --> 02:11:49.658]  They weren't Aryan.
[02:11:50.436 --> 02:11:52.577]  So, I mean, Hitler's working with a Zionist.
[02:11:53.097 --> 02:11:57.578]  These are evil people run together in the same groups, in the same camps.
[02:11:58.778 --> 02:12:05.960]  And yeah, you've got these globalists who are royal Israelites, is what they call themselves, British Royal Israelism.
[02:12:06.020 --> 02:12:07.861]  You know, that's where that whole thing comes from.
[02:12:07.901 --> 02:12:11.582]  This thing of the Aryans are the real Jews and all of this.
[02:12:11.662 --> 02:12:13.682]  I mean, that's not some new thing.
[02:12:14.162 --> 02:12:16.703]  The Queen of England is sworn in as an Israelite.
[02:12:17.626 --> 02:12:30.296]  She is christened, she is coronated, as the proper term, on the stone that supposedly Abraham was going to sacrifice Jacob on.
[02:12:30.917 --> 02:12:35.621]  And so they see themselves as the real Zionists, and then the Jews must die.
[02:12:36.041 --> 02:12:39.704]  They see civic Arabic Jews as the enemy.
[02:12:40.592 --> 02:12:45.336]  That's why you had Zionists in 1953-1960 radiating 100,000 Hasidic Jews from Spain and other areas.
[02:12:45.496 --> 02:12:50.120]  They just marched them up and fried their little heads and killed most of them on the spot.
[02:13:04.599 --> 02:13:07.662]  And again, it was all dark Jews that they targeted.
[02:13:07.702 --> 02:13:09.524]  That's in Harots, folks.
[02:13:09.564 --> 02:13:10.925]  That's in the Jerusalem Post.
[02:13:11.905 --> 02:13:17.810]  And so the Jewish Review can attack me all day for saying that.
[02:13:19.131 --> 02:13:27.739]  But they're dumb enough to then send a link over to my website where people will just read Harots saying... Now, Harots doesn't say they targeted the brown Jews.
[02:13:28.139 --> 02:13:30.641]  It just says they targeted this group of Jews.
[02:13:31.001 --> 02:13:32.963]  Who, you notice, are the darker ones.
[02:13:34.645 --> 02:13:40.188]  And then you got the guys, you know, stomping around with their eye patches and their shaved head and a one blue eye staring out at you.
[02:13:41.008 --> 02:13:48.612]  I mean, in fact, there's been reports of, uh, you know, famous Jewish leaders on airplanes going, I had to ride with all those low Jews.
[02:13:49.212 --> 02:13:51.013]  I mean, it's the same thing, folks.
[02:13:51.854 --> 02:13:54.015]  And so you, it's a sick joke.
[02:13:54.175 --> 02:13:58.477]  I mean, I, you know, I'm against barbecuing brown Jews, so I'm bad.
[02:13:58.517 --> 02:13:59.257]  I'm anti-Semitic.
[02:13:59.537 --> 02:14:00.398]  Well, so be it then.
[02:14:01.320 --> 02:14:05.822]  I mean, if it's anti-semitic, and I don't want to microwave Jews, then I'm anti-semitic.
[02:14:06.922 --> 02:14:10.704]  If it's liberal to be pro-gun and pro-border, anti-abortion, I'm a liberal.
[02:14:11.944 --> 02:14:13.565]  I mean, literally, if the shoe fits, wear it.
[02:14:13.585 --> 02:14:17.386]  Of course, if the shoe doesn't fit, then these groups have just lost all credibility.
[02:14:18.887 --> 02:14:20.908]  We fight Nazis, we fight the Klan.
[02:14:20.988 --> 02:14:22.648]  I got a death threat this weekend.
[02:14:23.088 --> 02:14:23.829]  Two of them, actually.
[02:14:23.869 --> 02:14:26.230]  Well, one death threat, one another threatening thing.
[02:14:27.010 --> 02:14:29.411]  You know, calling me a... You're nothing but a...
[02:14:29.980 --> 02:14:31.760]  You're nothing but an in-lover.
[02:14:33.281 --> 02:14:36.001]  Look, I don't like the racist black groups either.
[02:14:37.142 --> 02:14:41.463]  And again, you've got the racist black groups saying they're the chosen people, they're the real Jews.
[02:14:42.663 --> 02:14:44.143]  It really gets pretty old, folks.
[02:14:44.304 --> 02:14:44.924]  I don't care.
[02:14:45.004 --> 02:14:47.464]  As long as you want me to have freedom, I care about you.
[02:14:48.965 --> 02:14:58.287]  But if you're a white supremacist running around saying you're supreme, or you're a Jew saying it, or you're a Mecha or a Raza group saying it, then you've got another thing coming.
[02:14:59.667 --> 02:15:02.189]  You know, I'm a minority in Texas now as a white person.
[02:15:03.310 --> 02:15:09.435]  And, you know, some of these Hispanic groups want to shoot their mouths off and go, ha ha ha, we're taking over.
[02:15:09.455 --> 02:15:12.958]  No, the big banks are going to use you to balkanize this state.
[02:15:13.398 --> 02:15:16.841]  You're going to end up worse on the end of it, just like everybody else is, except for the elite.
[02:15:19.323 --> 02:15:20.063]  Steve in Texas.
[02:15:20.103 --> 02:15:20.664]  Go ahead, Steve.
[02:15:21.104 --> 02:15:21.464]  Hey, Alex.
[02:15:22.165 --> 02:15:22.625]  Hello, Alex.
[02:15:23.426 --> 02:15:23.466]  Hi.
[02:15:24.059 --> 02:15:27.820]  Hey, I appreciate what you're doing and I appreciate the chance to talk.
[02:15:28.040 --> 02:15:36.783]  There was something that every time I see it or hear it, it just really bugs me and that's this so-called non-lethal Taser gun that the police use.
[02:15:36.843 --> 02:15:38.463]  Taser has now had to take that off.
[02:15:38.503 --> 02:15:39.624]  They are now a lethal weapon.
[02:15:40.244 --> 02:15:44.125]  Well, and that started to dawn on me and I was thinking about this.
[02:15:44.145 --> 02:15:46.246]  There's something just inhumane about that.
[02:15:46.266 --> 02:15:49.127]  If we were to do that to an animal, you know, we would go to jail instantly.
[02:15:51.380 --> 02:15:58.745]  Just recently, I think in Austin, another man in their custody died just over the last weekend about it.
[02:15:59.626 --> 02:16:10.213]  When I listen to you and I hear you mention, you know, the prison planet and police state and all that, it started to dawn on me that, you know, we really are becoming slaves.
[02:16:10.253 --> 02:16:18.398]  And if we make a comparison between tasers of today and the slave driver's whiff of yesteryears,
[02:16:19.181 --> 02:16:23.442]  Then we can make a comparison that back in those days that was considered a non-lethal weapon.
[02:16:23.462 --> 02:16:24.043]  They had guns.
[02:16:24.083 --> 02:16:25.843]  They could have killed their slaves if they didn't want to.
[02:16:25.863 --> 02:16:29.104]  They wanted to whip them into submission and that's exactly what a taser gun does.
[02:16:29.164 --> 02:16:31.805]  It gets you to submit whether you want to or not.
[02:16:32.405 --> 02:16:37.087]  And now they're saying that they're lethal and they're going to keep using them and taser is increasing the power.
[02:16:37.587 --> 02:16:44.869]  Yes, and I just made... A bunch of cops have sued because they're told they have to be tasered in training and they're having heart attacks and stuff.
[02:16:45.635 --> 02:16:56.478]  If that chaser hits the right nerve jumble, you're going to have problems.
[02:16:56.958 --> 02:17:01.119]  More for me, I was making the comparison between keeping the slaves in order.
[02:17:02.159 --> 02:17:04.219]  That's exactly what they're using today.
[02:17:04.279 --> 02:17:06.660]  They want us to submit and stay in order.
[02:17:07.381 --> 02:17:15.372]  You know, once, if you're stopped by a police officer and if you don't submit and do everything they tell you to, then, you know, there's a possibility he might pull out his taser gun and taser you until you submit.
[02:17:16.344 --> 02:17:22.490]  And the slave drivers would do that with the slaves, they'd whip them, you know, sting them, and that's exactly what the tasers do.
[02:17:22.510 --> 02:17:26.794]  Yeah, they ought to just start carrying Caterinontails.
[02:17:26.814 --> 02:17:30.057]  They are the authorities, the officials.
[02:17:30.317 --> 02:17:32.099]  We're the civilians.
[02:17:32.539 --> 02:17:33.059]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:17:33.099 --> 02:17:34.220]  Just wanted to make that comparison.
[02:17:34.501 --> 02:17:35.822]  No, Steve, excellent point.
[02:17:35.842 --> 02:17:36.743]  Hitting in plain view.
[02:17:36.783 --> 02:17:37.784]  Thanks for pointing it out to me.
[02:17:38.544 --> 02:17:40.166]  All right, we'll be right back.
[02:17:40.246 --> 02:17:42.348]  I'll cover some news and we'll talk to the Congressman.
[02:17:46.164 --> 02:17:52.530]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:17:52.750 --> 02:17:57.754]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:17:58.095 --> 02:18:06.002]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:18:06.142 --> 02:18:13.208]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:18:13.388 --> 02:18:14.609]  There are no side effects.
[02:18:14.770 --> 02:18:18.153]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:18:18.213 --> 02:18:19.334]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:18:19.615 --> 02:18:20.896]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:18:21.096 --> 02:18:27.943]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[02:19:50.995 --> 02:19:52.236]  Currency devaluation.
[02:19:52.556 --> 02:19:53.096]  Inflation.
[02:19:53.576 --> 02:19:54.257]  One and the same.
[02:19:54.997 --> 02:19:58.980]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:20:05.259 --> 02:20:08.381]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:20:08.641 --> 02:20:10.462]  The bank paid you 1%.
[02:20:10.522 --> 02:20:14.564]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:20:15.444 --> 02:20:16.325]  Here is reality.
[02:20:16.685 --> 02:20:20.287]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:20:20.747 --> 02:20:24.429]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:20:24.989 --> 02:20:27.430]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[02:20:29.153 --> 02:20:32.876]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.

[02:20:34.758 --> 02:20:36.039]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[02:20:36.079 --> 02:20:38.541]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[02:20:52.634 --> 02:21:00.521]  The best-kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[02:21:00.741 --> 02:21:03.383]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with BlazeMed Inc.'

[02:21:19.896 --> 02:21:21.597]  Or call LaysMed at 702-953-0267 today.
[02:21:51.846 --> 02:21:54.847]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest.
[02:21:55.447 --> 02:21:58.048]  A gun on my hip and the right to arrest.
[02:21:58.448 --> 02:22:00.489]  Alright, let's get back into the news.
[02:22:00.509 --> 02:22:02.669]  Border agents in armored cars.
[02:22:03.450 --> 02:22:06.070]  Just out of the news of Australia, won't really hear about this here.
[02:22:06.090 --> 02:22:06.130]  U.S.
[02:22:06.811 --> 02:22:13.753]  law enforcement officers have started patrolling a remote stretch of the Arizona-Mexico border in armored cars after agents were shot at
[02:22:14.577 --> 02:22:22.619]  They get shot at every week, pelted with rocks and rammed by Mexican smugglers in a surge of violence, authorities say.
[02:22:23.459 --> 02:22:26.780]  And MS-13, Los Zetas, all of them have called.
[02:22:27.360 --> 02:22:32.281]  There have been big, you know, $50,000, $200,000 bounties in the newspapers, openly.
[02:22:32.301 --> 02:22:35.502]  Has our government called for people to be arrested who openly put bounties out?
[02:22:36.062 --> 02:22:36.362]  No!
[02:22:36.482 --> 02:22:38.443]  Because they want to break this country down.
[02:22:40.100 --> 02:22:47.764]  Smugglers fired on sheriff's deputies and agents six times during the period, and pelted them with rocks 104 occasions.
[02:22:48.144 --> 02:22:48.865]  104 occasions!
[02:22:49.685 --> 02:22:52.847]  And also Mexican troops have now been seen firing yet again.
[02:22:53.627 --> 02:22:57.029]  In August, stone hurdling Mexican smugglers donned a U.S.
[02:22:57.069 --> 02:23:00.831]  Customs and Border Patrol, uh, downed a U.S.
[02:23:00.891 --> 02:23:03.073]  Customs and Border Patrol A-Station helicopter.
[02:23:04.473 --> 02:23:05.654]  You see there, ladies and gentlemen?
[02:23:06.357 --> 02:23:12.221]  Violent attacks have increased sharply in recent months, so we decided to acquire an armored vehicle so as to better protect our agents.
[02:23:12.901 --> 02:23:13.141]  U.S.
[02:23:13.161 --> 02:23:14.362]  Border Patrol spokesman said.
[02:23:15.943 --> 02:23:16.443]  You know what?
[02:23:17.924 --> 02:23:19.705]  I want the head of the Border Patrol Union back on.
[02:23:19.725 --> 02:23:20.766]  We had him on about a year ago.
[02:23:21.687 --> 02:23:23.107]  Called it a New World Order takeover.
[02:23:24.128 --> 02:23:27.510]  Folks, they got armored vehicles and sound cannons in most major cities.
[02:23:27.530 --> 02:23:32.353]  They'll call them out if you're having basically a Boy Scout march.
[02:23:32.413 --> 02:23:33.054]  I mean, literally.
[02:23:33.514 --> 02:23:34.474]  The citizens are evil.
[02:23:34.514 --> 02:23:35.355]  We gotta be watched.
[02:23:35.990 --> 02:23:38.352]  But we should have tanks on the border.
[02:23:38.372 --> 02:23:40.273]  We should engage the Mexican troops.
[02:23:41.675 --> 02:23:43.656]  They fire one bullet over that border.
[02:23:43.696 --> 02:23:46.638]  We should call in warthogs and kill them all.
[02:23:47.799 --> 02:23:59.909]  A foreign enemy government that openly wants to take our country over is firing hundreds of times at us, our consulates are being fired at, and our government doesn't do a thing.
[02:24:01.990 --> 02:24:05.053]  Meanwhile, a country across the ocean that said nothing to us is invaded.
[02:24:06.280 --> 02:24:07.521]  I mean, I'm really sick of it.
[02:24:09.963 --> 02:24:22.554]  He said the Yuma Sector Border Patrol acquired a 3,000-pound armored car from the Baltimore Police Department and plan to use it for patrols in the remote desert region as soon as it has been refitted.
[02:24:23.295 --> 02:24:26.438]  A spokesman for the Yuma Sheriff's Department said deputies began patrolling last week
[02:24:27.610 --> 02:24:34.217]  In a 8,165 kilogram British-made armored car powered by a Rolls-Royce engine, they bought second-hand.
[02:24:34.257 --> 02:24:36.338]  I mean, they need 50 armored vehicles.
[02:24:37.079 --> 02:24:39.381]  They need warrior-wheeled vehicles.
[02:24:39.421 --> 02:24:40.662]  They need howitzers.
[02:24:41.203 --> 02:24:42.544]  They need Laws Rockets.
[02:24:42.604 --> 02:24:45.807]  They need to attack and kill those Mexican troops!
[02:24:47.389 --> 02:24:48.850]  Folks, they've killed FBI.
[02:24:48.890 --> 02:24:50.031]  They've killed Border Patrol.
[02:24:50.311 --> 02:24:51.452]  They've killed Forest Service.
[02:24:51.472 --> 02:24:53.054]  They've killed a whole bunch of sheriff's deputies.
[02:24:54.705 --> 02:24:58.869]  Last time I checked, they killed five deputies this year in Texas on the border.
[02:24:59.489 --> 02:25:00.570]  I mean, I'm sick of it!
[02:25:01.451 --> 02:25:08.658]  They're going to pull me over and ask to search my car looking for guns in the state of Texas while our border is wide open and the U.S.
[02:25:08.718 --> 02:25:13.142]  mission is closed because of rocket attacks.
[02:25:13.522 --> 02:25:15.464]  Where are your priorities, you idiots?
[02:25:16.945 --> 02:25:20.989]  I mean, we're under attack down there by a foreign military!
[02:25:22.034 --> 02:25:26.696]  And I want those foreign troops dead, dead, dead!
[02:25:27.656 --> 02:25:35.499]  They shoot at our military, they shoot at our border patrol, engage them and wipe them out!
[02:25:37.260 --> 02:25:38.841]  I've had the union head on several times.
[02:25:38.881 --> 02:25:40.281]  I had him on about two years ago.
[02:25:40.301 --> 02:25:43.262]  I've had them all on, and they'll sit there and tell you.
[02:25:43.282 --> 02:25:44.943]  I've had retired agents on, right after they retire.
[02:25:45.343 --> 02:25:46.604]  You've heard them, you've heard them on other shows.
[02:25:47.124 --> 02:25:49.425]  They're told to run, not to shoot back.
[02:25:50.157 --> 02:25:51.819]  They have them out there with handguns.
[02:25:52.340 --> 02:25:55.944]  Every one of them should have been issued Barrett semi-automatic .50 cals.
[02:25:56.585 --> 02:26:00.710]  The second, you know, a Mexican armored vehicle opened fires on them.
[02:26:00.730 --> 02:26:05.716]  They have armored Humvees with Heckler & Koch submachine guns from 500 yards away.
[02:26:05.736 --> 02:26:06.376]  Man, you got a .50.
[02:26:07.890 --> 02:26:08.691]  Just don't stop.
[02:26:08.771 --> 02:26:13.016]  I want to mount helicopters with 50s, cobras, you name it.
[02:26:13.076 --> 02:26:21.625]  They need blimps up there, tethered blimps, which they have, but the Army won't let them use it for interdiction of ground smugglers.
[02:26:22.246 --> 02:26:25.390]  They only let them use it for other interdictions of aircraft.
[02:26:25.910 --> 02:26:27.252]  I mean, it's time, folks.
[02:26:27.272 --> 02:26:28.153]  We're under attack.
[02:26:28.806 --> 02:26:38.129]  But no, no, gotta have the military in New Orleans, gotta have Dutch troops, gotta have Mexican troops, gotta set the precedent for foreign troops in America.
[02:26:38.569 --> 02:26:39.870]  All our troops are overseas.
[02:26:42.151 --> 02:26:42.631]  You know what?
[02:26:42.691 --> 02:26:44.512]  So what if we have a war with Mexico?
[02:26:44.572 --> 02:26:46.692]  So what if we put troops down there and they start it?
[02:26:47.633 --> 02:26:48.353]  Let them start it!
[02:26:48.393 --> 02:26:50.174]  We'll kick their butts again!
[02:26:51.994 --> 02:26:53.035]  I'm tired of it!
[02:26:54.895 --> 02:26:57.036]  This country is under attack!
[02:26:57.754 --> 02:27:00.435]  The enemy is ramming down the gates and killing people.
[02:27:01.496 --> 02:27:03.257]  And these FBI agents just love it.
[02:27:03.277 --> 02:27:04.438]  They love getting shot.
[02:27:04.478 --> 02:27:11.481]  These Border Patrol agents, I know they don't love it, but I... Now they got the FBI out making mean statements about the Minutemen.
[02:27:11.521 --> 02:27:15.404]  Because you sit there with spy glasses reporting the illegal aliens.
[02:27:15.844 --> 02:27:19.446]  By the way, these coyotes, these Mexican troops, feed on the poor Mexican people.
[02:27:20.146 --> 02:27:21.507]  They're the number one cause of death.
[02:27:22.347 --> 02:27:25.229]  You don't hear the immigrant groups caring about that, because you don't care about Mexicans.
[02:27:26.351 --> 02:27:27.612]  You care about the New World Order!
[02:27:28.832 --> 02:27:30.433]  We'll be right back with Congressman Ron Paul.
[02:27:35.955 --> 02:27:36.835]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.336 --> 02:27:38.936]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.857 --> 02:27:42.538]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.723 --> 02:27:49.084]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[02:27:49.344 --> 02:27:49.664]  Why?

[02:28:45.896 --> 02:28:47.497]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:47.637 --> 02:28:51.740]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:51.880 --> 02:28:54.742]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:54.842 --> 02:29:01.567]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:29:01.747 --> 02:29:04.749]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:04.949 --> 02:29:07.350]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:07.470 --> 02:29:15.356]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[02:29:15.776 --> 02:29:26.944]  Benzene, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon 222, Foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are extracted.
[02:29:27.084 --> 02:29:34.870]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:34.910 --> 02:29:35.310]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:29:35.370 --> 02:29:37.071]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:29:45.342 --> 02:29:48.283]  You can live for weeks without food and days without water.
[02:29:48.403 --> 02:29:50.644]  But without oxygen, you would be dead in minutes.
[02:29:51.004 --> 02:29:52.985]  Oxygen is truly the breath of life.
[02:29:53.145 --> 02:29:55.606]  Where oxygen is abundant, disease cannot live.
[02:29:55.686 --> 02:29:58.707]  But where oxygen is deficient, disease will thrive.
[02:29:58.887 --> 02:30:00.128]  Are you getting enough oxygen?
[02:30:00.328 --> 02:30:05.770]  If you spend much time indoors or live in an urban area, you're probably oxygen deficient and don't even know it.
[02:30:05.850 --> 02:30:10.432]  This makes you vulnerable to all types of chronic disease, as well as undue emotional stress.
[02:30:10.752 --> 02:30:16.955]  Clearly, increasing your body's oxygen level without negative side effects is critical to attaining good health and a sense of well-being.
[02:30:17.175 --> 02:30:23.098]  This is especially true for smokers, those with respiratory disorders, athletes, and all health-minded individuals.
[02:30:23.398 --> 02:30:29.161]  The Un-Medical Miracle Oxygen is a book that will show you safe, easy ways to increase your body's oxygen level.

[02:30:37.765 --> 02:30:38.185]  That's 888-224-74-16.
[02:30:38.225 --> 02:30:51.655]  Blasting out on the AM and FM dial from Kansas City, Missouri to Los Angeles, California, from Niagara Falls, New York to Pensacola, Florida.
[02:30:51.675 --> 02:30:55.318]  Simulcasting on WWCR Global Shortwave, the Internet at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:31:07.148 --> 02:31:12.089]  We are very honored to have Congressman Ron Paul with us for the next 25 minutes.
[02:31:12.629 --> 02:31:14.490]  We appreciate him and his busy schedule.
[02:31:14.510 --> 02:31:16.650]  They're actually lining up some people to run against him.
[02:31:17.270 --> 02:31:21.471]  His 67% election rate is not daunting them.
[02:31:21.491 --> 02:31:23.532]  And with these new electronic voting machines, look out.
[02:31:23.972 --> 02:31:26.533]  Gotta really support the Congressman this year.
[02:31:26.993 --> 02:31:31.774]  That's a message to all the troops out there on the front lines of the fight for this republic.
[02:31:33.351 --> 02:31:36.552]  But, Congressman, first off, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:31:36.912 --> 02:31:37.953]  Oh, good to be with you again.
[02:31:38.313 --> 02:31:39.874]  You bet.
[02:31:39.974 --> 02:31:42.435]  Now they're having to finally send armored vehicles to the border.
[02:31:43.175 --> 02:31:47.337]  There have been 600 deaths in the last eight months on the Texas-Mexico border.
[02:31:47.437 --> 02:31:48.577]  They closed the U.S.
[02:31:49.157 --> 02:31:51.738]  mission because of rocket attacks and machine gun attacks.
[02:31:52.299 --> 02:31:54.640]  As you know, the Laredo is completely shut down.
[02:31:54.720 --> 02:31:55.820]  Laredo is shut down.
[02:31:56.200 --> 02:31:57.221]  Almost no terrorism.
[02:31:58.101 --> 02:32:00.722]  And Bush is just ignoring the entire problem.
[02:32:01.730 --> 02:32:08.114]  Yep, and I imagine he will because he's for the New World Order and you know he's not going to oppose any of these moves.
[02:32:08.434 --> 02:32:30.226]  I was in a high school class just this morning and I talked to the principal and that was one of the main things he wanted to talk to me on a personal level was the burden that the local schools have with illegal immigrants and they have all the federal mandates and it's a real problem to him personally as a teacher and as an administrator and of course he recognized it was a burden for our taxpayers too.
[02:32:31.576 --> 02:32:37.181]  But, I mean, in polls, 80-plus percent of the American people, including the majority of Hispanics, are against these open borders.
[02:32:37.701 --> 02:32:44.606]  Why are the Republicans and Democrats ignoring the mountain of public support to close them and the Constitution demanding it?
[02:32:44.626 --> 02:32:48.970]  Well, I think it's an obsession with this fear of not being politically correct.
[02:32:49.050 --> 02:32:49.971]  I think that's part of it.
[02:32:49.991 --> 02:32:55.235]  And I think some of it is just flat-out, they think it's practical, pragmatic politics to
[02:32:55.819 --> 02:33:05.466]  To do this, you point out that maybe the Hispanics aren't that supportive of open borders, which I agree with you, especially those who are American citizens and got here the honest way.
[02:33:06.046 --> 02:33:15.953]  But they have this notion that if they do anything to restrict immigration, that Hispanics will never vote for you, and therefore they would lose their vote.
[02:33:16.013 --> 02:33:17.814]  And that's the name of the game up there.
[02:33:17.954 --> 02:33:20.796]  It's not to deliberately undermine the Constitution.
[02:33:20.876 --> 02:33:23.378]  It's never deliberately to uphold the Constitution.
[02:33:23.985 --> 02:33:27.427]  Everything is designed to maintain or secure political power.
[02:33:27.868 --> 02:33:31.070]  And their interpretation is that this is a benefit.
[02:33:31.150 --> 02:33:38.015]  Now, you and I agree that they're not looking at it right because it's obviously a political liability from our viewpoint.
[02:33:38.355 --> 02:33:48.302]  Well, Rome finally fell and became rotten from within because there were more people from outside the Empire's core than there were that had been born there.
[02:33:49.085 --> 02:33:52.047]  Right, and they believed in welfare at that time, too.
[02:33:52.147 --> 02:33:59.191]  They didn't think that people would have to work, and for a long time the Romans lived off the lands that they conquered.
[02:33:59.231 --> 02:34:10.157]  But they eventually consumed all that they conquered, and they weren't producing anything, which is the tendency that we have these days, because we're not producing as we used to.
[02:34:10.258 --> 02:34:13.339]  So if we don't change our way, we will go the way of Rome.
[02:34:15.271 --> 02:34:17.053]  I see that as rather sad.
[02:34:17.073 --> 02:34:23.342]  We should be protecting that element that protects all of us economically and politically, and that is personal liberty.
[02:34:23.362 --> 02:34:25.325]  And that would solve all our problems.
[02:34:30.999 --> 02:34:33.061]  Of this new individual he wants for the Supreme Court.
[02:34:33.141 --> 02:34:37.084]  I mean, a big liberal, anti-gun, pro-open border, pro-abortion.
[02:34:37.545 --> 02:34:43.209]  A lot of conservative commentators are now being forced to admit that Bush is totally betraying the party.
[02:34:43.430 --> 02:34:50.456]  I mean, you said three, four years ago with your neocon speech that more betrayals happen with Republicans than we have with Democrats.
[02:34:50.476 --> 02:34:51.957]  Can you elaborate on that?
[02:34:52.117 --> 02:34:54.719]  Well, I think that's when conservatives let their guard down.
[02:34:55.360 --> 02:34:59.183]  If you see when Reagan was first elected, when the Bushes got in office,
[02:34:59.818 --> 02:35:04.380]  The effort to really fight for our values is diminished.
[02:35:04.440 --> 02:35:19.567]  People say, oh, we're in charge, and especially this last time in 2000, we had control of the administration, we had control of the House and the Senate, and therefore the court appointees would all be okay, and the conservatives just sort of get lackadaisical.
[02:35:20.334 --> 02:35:26.815]  And some of the worst things happen when you get the so-called conservative Republicans in charge from Nixon on down.
[02:35:26.855 --> 02:35:31.176]  You know, some of the terrible things that big government flourishes under Republicans.
[02:35:31.556 --> 02:35:38.937]  But my problem, and those who argue the case for limited government as a Republican, is that, oh, you don't like our president.
[02:35:38.957 --> 02:35:40.198]  You're underlining the president.
[02:35:40.218 --> 02:35:41.098]  You're not loyal.
[02:35:41.118 --> 02:35:43.498]  If you don't support the war, you're unpatriotic.
[02:35:44.498 --> 02:35:48.239]  But I think what is happening right now with this appointment
[02:35:48.895 --> 02:35:49.675]  Finally!
[02:35:49.695 --> 02:35:50.636]  They're starting to wake up.
[02:35:50.676 --> 02:35:57.978]  They should have been awake years ago, but I think this appointment has all of a sudden galvanized the conservatives to speak out.
[02:35:58.038 --> 02:36:06.460]  Maybe they'll speak out more forcefully against the war, as well as the problems with immigration, and deal with these appointments as well.
[02:36:07.461 --> 02:36:11.402]  Congressman, it seems like Bush really is living in a bubble.
[02:36:11.542 --> 02:36:13.543]  I mean, he says that he doesn't read the newspapers.
[02:36:14.183 --> 02:36:18.164]  I never believed that, but I think his advisors don't read the newspapers because
[02:36:19.378 --> 02:36:24.121]  Ninety to nine, they vote that they can't torture somebody too much.
[02:36:25.361 --> 02:36:34.747]  And then Bush is sending people to prison through his Pentagon and his JAG generals are sending people to prison for five years for following orders.
[02:36:34.787 --> 02:36:36.188]  We have the Gonzales memos.
[02:36:36.568 --> 02:36:43.652]  And then Bush comes right out and says, uh, yeah, we're not, I'm going to veto any law saying that we can't torture people.
[02:36:43.732 --> 02:36:43.952]  I mean,
[02:36:45.148 --> 02:36:46.469]  It's embarrassing.
[02:36:46.889 --> 02:36:56.375]  You know, it's really hard to believe it's happening right in front of us, whether it's the torturing or whether it's the process of denying habeas corpus to an American citizen.
[02:36:56.395 --> 02:37:01.298]  You say, well, it's only one, two, or three people, but boy, that principle is so significant.
[02:37:01.879 --> 02:37:03.139]  I think it's arrogance.
[02:37:03.259 --> 02:37:05.221]  Arrogance is a power that they have where
[02:37:06.388 --> 02:37:14.773]  Where they themselves are like communists, not in the philosophy completely, but in the sense that they design what is right.
[02:37:14.793 --> 02:37:17.314]  You know, the Communist Party said what was right and wrong.
[02:37:17.374 --> 02:37:18.755]  It wasn't a higher source.
[02:37:18.975 --> 02:37:20.616]  Well, Rove told the New York Times that.
[02:37:20.636 --> 02:37:23.838]  He said, we govern reality by telling you what it is.
[02:37:23.898 --> 02:37:27.019]  But if we don't play along, they're just clowns.
[02:37:27.460 --> 02:37:29.361]  Yeah, they want to set these standards.
[02:37:30.523 --> 02:37:31.765]  They're absolutely arrogant.
[02:37:31.806 --> 02:37:38.882]  That's why they need to be brought down to their knees, especially people like Rove, who have run this show for so long.
[02:37:39.649 --> 02:37:45.613]  This could be a big event pretty soon if Roe gets indicted.
[02:37:45.753 --> 02:38:01.244]  Well, sir, you're a medical doctor, and I respect the fields of medicine and the study of this, but doesn't that sound like delusional behavior when you start saying, I mean, that's almost a medical condition, not just psychiatric, when you start saying, you know, I am the king, I make reality.
[02:38:01.284 --> 02:38:03.285]  I mean, that's like fruitcake land.
[02:38:03.325 --> 02:38:03.986]  That's dangerous.
[02:38:04.426 --> 02:38:05.727]  Well, I think it is.
[02:38:05.747 --> 02:38:08.449]  I think it's borderline thinking.
[02:38:09.133 --> 02:38:13.435]  But I think a lot of politicians are borderline anyway.
[02:38:13.915 --> 02:38:20.977]  But when you get that much power and you're borderline on your thinking and where truth comes from, it's a rather dangerous situation.
[02:38:21.137 --> 02:38:24.318]  And that's why I preach the Constitution.
[02:38:24.358 --> 02:38:25.959]  The Constitution is so important.
[02:38:26.459 --> 02:38:30.500]  A lot of people accuse me, well, Ron Paul, all he does is evoke his personal beliefs.
[02:38:31.141 --> 02:38:34.962]  Well, in a way that's true, but my personal belief is that you should follow the rule of law.
[02:38:35.464 --> 02:38:38.487]  The rule of law is more important to me than anything else.
[02:38:38.507 --> 02:38:43.871]  That doesn't mean that we shouldn't change our laws and we shouldn't change our Constitution if need be.
[02:38:43.891 --> 02:38:47.154]  It's just that we ought to obey the rule of law.
[02:38:47.774 --> 02:38:53.219]  And so sometimes I have to go against my desires on some legislation.
[02:38:53.259 --> 02:38:56.581]  You know, they'll have a piece of federal legislation that sounds pretty good to me.
[02:38:57.442 --> 02:38:59.944]  You know, maybe on liability reform or something like this.
[02:39:00.224 --> 02:39:01.886]  But I don't have the authority to do this.
[02:39:02.086 --> 02:39:02.927]  I'm not allowed to do this.
[02:39:02.967 --> 02:39:04.448]  So I'll have to vote against it.
[02:39:04.958 --> 02:39:07.900]  In order to preserve what I think is important.
[02:39:08.100 --> 02:39:15.006]  You're talking about the 10th Amendment because the road to hell is paved with good intentions and if we build a centralized system it's going to be abused.
[02:39:15.606 --> 02:39:16.847]  That's right.
[02:39:17.828 --> 02:39:28.256]  I think what has happened over the last 100 years plus was that after they passed the 14th Amendment, not immediately but as time has evolved,
[02:39:28.875 --> 02:39:29.255]  I think so.
[02:39:48.229 --> 02:39:50.691]  We have the authority to do this.
[02:39:51.792 --> 02:39:54.474]  What are the Democrats saying about Bush right now?
[02:39:54.534 --> 02:39:57.836]  I mean, double the growth rate of government what it was with Clinton.
[02:39:58.296 --> 02:40:03.800]  Every major Great Society program ballooning, metastasizing, wildly blooming.
[02:40:04.161 --> 02:40:12.587]  And then meanwhile, these judges he's appointing left and right are, to use the false left-right spectrum, are left of Hillary Clinton.
[02:40:13.387 --> 02:40:15.928]  I mean, I've told Democrats that hate Bush.
[02:40:15.968 --> 02:40:19.670]  If you love your party's views, then you should really know what the policies are.
[02:40:19.690 --> 02:40:21.110]  You should like Bush, not hate him.
[02:40:21.370 --> 02:40:29.834]  Well, I think they do, and I think they would like to convoy to hang around, and all these problems to exist, and that Carr-Rove remains a punching bag.
[02:40:30.307 --> 02:40:38.610]  But, you know, they do complain a bit, and they'll even talk about the Constitution and states' rights and balanced budgets and cutting back.
[02:40:39.050 --> 02:40:40.670]  But no, they're not believable.
[02:40:40.951 --> 02:40:45.592]  You know, who's going to believe that Democrats are really serious about fiscal conservatism?
[02:40:46.873 --> 02:40:54.055]  But they talk that way and they pretend that they're concerned, but they really aren't.
[02:40:54.631 --> 02:40:59.038]  And they just, you know, are the problem as much as anything.
[02:40:59.079 --> 02:41:01.623]  They were the ones that helped Bush pass the Patriot Act.
[02:41:01.823 --> 02:41:06.991]  They're the ones who helped Bush pass all this warmongering, neo-con-interventionism.
[02:41:08.515 --> 02:41:10.116]  They offer nothing!
[02:41:10.476 --> 02:41:15.020]  Although on occasion, their rhetoric sounds like the old Republicans used to say.
[02:41:15.080 --> 02:41:32.513]  Congressman, do you get the feeling I get, and if you don't, I mean obviously tell us, but they passed the National ID Card Real ID Act, they're pushing for open borders, they passed the new Freedom Initiative for forced psychological testing and drugging, just everything, you know, Bush up there saying torture's good,
[02:41:33.428 --> 02:41:37.270]  All of this, hey, let's get rid of Posse Com and Tadus, let's have troops run your life.
[02:41:37.710 --> 02:41:48.475]  I mean, it seems like the freight train is going down a steeper and steeper grade, and no one's in control, and it just seems like there's a wild corporate orgy of looting going on.
[02:41:49.195 --> 02:41:58.519]  You know, it's real easy to blame Congress and the President, and they deserve a lot of blame, but to me it's so strange that the President
[02:41:59.335 --> 02:42:01.896]  Can make these proposals, and they're even plausible.
[02:42:01.916 --> 02:42:03.556]  I mean, they shouldn't even be plausible.
[02:42:03.836 --> 02:42:21.441]  When he talks about martial law, dealing with some epidemic that might come later on to have forced quarantines, doing away with posse comitatus in order to deal with national natural disasters, as well as the potential of terrorist acts.
[02:42:22.967 --> 02:42:24.287]  But hardly anybody says anything.
[02:42:24.527 --> 02:42:26.368]  People must be scared to death.
[02:42:26.388 --> 02:42:28.609]  They must say, well, you know, somebody's going to get me.
[02:42:28.829 --> 02:42:31.270]  So therefore, and they have no confidence in themselves.
[02:42:31.410 --> 02:42:34.010]  But Congressman, I mean, you're a veteran yourself.
[02:42:34.030 --> 02:42:35.011]  You're a medical doctor.
[02:42:35.491 --> 02:42:39.012]  I've heard a lot of other medical doctors on air saying that a quarantine's going to do nothing.
[02:42:39.052 --> 02:42:40.192]  You can't quarantine it.
[02:42:40.833 --> 02:42:42.953]  And that this thing's being way overhyped.
[02:42:43.433 --> 02:42:47.074]  And that Rumsfeld, by the way, is tied into the company that's selling this flu pill.
[02:42:47.475 --> 02:42:51.856]  They're going to make at least $4 billion in the next few months, and it's Bush out there
[02:42:52.833 --> 02:42:58.719]  Pushing this entire thing, but I mean, you know, we need martial law because of the terrorist threat.
[02:42:58.739 --> 02:43:00.521]  We need martial law because of the hurricane.
[02:43:00.541 --> 02:43:03.044]  We need martial law because of the bird flu.
[02:43:03.084 --> 02:43:05.026]  I mean, it's every day, it's martial law.
[02:43:05.327 --> 02:43:09.191]  And they have the propaganda machine, they get the attention.
[02:43:09.651 --> 02:43:15.133]  But it has to be work with the people who have become frightened and scared.
[02:43:15.233 --> 02:43:18.794]  I don't think this could have happened, you know, 150 years ago.
[02:43:18.814 --> 02:43:21.635]  Or, you know, I don't think the people would have been so complacent.
[02:43:21.675 --> 02:43:24.315]  So things are coming together to their benefit.
[02:43:24.796 --> 02:43:29.217]  But I agree, it is the president hyping this and the Rumsfeld.
[02:43:30.107 --> 02:43:37.030]  But it has to be in combination with the people being fearful enough that they will accept the man on the white horse.
[02:43:37.050 --> 02:43:38.110]  Well, you're a medical doctor.
[02:43:38.450 --> 02:43:41.151]  Can you give us your take on this bird flu?
[02:43:42.132 --> 02:43:45.213]  Probably no more of an expert than anybody else.
[02:43:46.993 --> 02:43:53.876]  My first reaction just with my political and medical background would be that it's way overly hyped.
[02:43:54.409 --> 02:44:01.812]  And to think that they have gone this far with it without a single case in the whole country?
[02:44:02.272 --> 02:44:06.614]  And they're willing to change the law and turn it into a military state?
[02:44:06.994 --> 02:44:09.435]  I mean, that is unbelievable!
[02:44:10.096 --> 02:44:13.097]  But isn't it even more obvious that every week it's some new reason?
[02:44:13.477 --> 02:44:20.280]  Yeah, and I imagine it's going to continue, but they're determined that they're going to have martial law and that people
[02:44:20.876 --> 02:44:26.861]  Seems to think that coming out of New Orleans, you know, they saw the breakdown of law and order and said, well, it was all those state people.
[02:44:26.901 --> 02:44:27.782]  They couldn't take care of it.
[02:44:27.822 --> 02:44:29.023]  Why do they want martial law?
[02:44:29.043 --> 02:44:30.103]  The people are putting up with it.
[02:44:30.123 --> 02:44:35.327]  We're putting up with all the corporate contracts and the scams and all the corruption and the bloated deficit.
[02:44:35.828 --> 02:44:40.852]  I mean, why is this, these corporate interests that control Bush, why are they so obsessed?
[02:44:41.397 --> 02:44:50.679]  With having troops on the street corners of America, I mean, Secretary of Defense Cohen in 98 was saying that in the Army Times, that troops on the street corner, you know, that means safety.
[02:44:51.439 --> 02:45:08.443]  I think they're concerned about the remnant, the remnant of those individuals who don't buy into this stuff and think that they should take care of themselves on their own, that they should have their own guns and their own provisions, and they don't want to depend on the government at all, and I think that is a threat to those who want to hold power.
[02:45:10.383 --> 02:45:18.102]  You know, the demonstration, I think there was some confiscation or threat of confiscation of guns even in New Orleans and certainly the move in
[02:45:19.379 --> 02:45:26.706]  In this country that we're trying to create this new perfect democracy, Iraq, that's one of the things they want to make sure is that the people don't have guns.
[02:45:27.267 --> 02:45:31.251]  So they don't want any resistance to their authoritarian rule.
[02:45:31.591 --> 02:45:40.400]  So, talking to Congresswoman Ron Paul here, he's coming to the exact same conclusion that we have in articles we've written and what other people are saying and now in the mainstream newspapers.
[02:45:40.820 --> 02:45:47.763]  We're living in a twilight zone with the government openly wanting to use the military on us to confiscate our guns.
[02:45:48.164 --> 02:46:02.611]  And Congressman, I don't know if you've seen my videos, but I've been to urban warfare drills in Hebron, Maryland, and in California, and in North Carolina, and I'm talking six, seven years ago, where they were training the Marines to take our guns, and they were training domestically, sir.
[02:46:03.011 --> 02:46:08.654]  And I have the video, and then now it's being manifest, and people are having trouble dealing with it.
[02:46:11.887 --> 02:46:12.688]  I mean, where is it going?
[02:46:12.748 --> 02:46:13.729]  Do you think they'll really have them?
[02:46:14.329 --> 02:46:18.873]  Well, in some ways it may serve our interests as well.
[02:46:19.113 --> 02:46:21.996]  Because, you know, I complain about the people being too complacent.
[02:46:22.416 --> 02:46:23.958]  I think there is going to be a limit.
[02:46:24.318 --> 02:46:29.042]  I just think that the gun issue is one that they will not win in this country.
[02:46:29.142 --> 02:46:35.007]  Because I think the American people ultimately think they do have a responsibility for themselves.
[02:46:35.127 --> 02:46:38.330]  And I think they're realizing that the local police never protect them.
[02:46:38.800 --> 02:46:42.022]  They're helpful at times, but they're really not what provide protection.
[02:46:42.062 --> 02:46:47.505]  You just think of a state like Texas, all the rural areas, and probably any state in the country.
[02:46:47.745 --> 02:46:49.266]  You're not protected because there are policemen.
[02:46:49.286 --> 02:46:52.548]  You're protected there because most people know you have a gun in your house.
[02:46:52.588 --> 02:47:01.432]  So you can be totally isolated, but you're reasonably safe, safer than you are in the inner city, because in the inner city, you have all the policemen, but there are no guns.
[02:47:01.452 --> 02:47:02.853]  The people don't have any guns.
[02:47:02.873 --> 02:47:04.214]  They've all been taken from them.
[02:47:04.894 --> 02:47:11.040]  So, I think it would be very hard to take the guns, and if they try to, I think our numbers will grow.
[02:47:11.060 --> 02:47:12.901]  And I think that's the same way it is.
[02:47:12.921 --> 02:47:22.970]  There's a growing number of people who are interested in protecting themselves financially, and they want to hold medals, you know, as the ultimate reserve against paper money.
[02:47:23.030 --> 02:47:26.013]  And I think that they're going to have trouble.
[02:47:26.393 --> 02:47:31.478]  And it's a shame, but I'm afraid it's going in that direction.
[02:47:32.748 --> 02:47:37.751]  Well, you know, a diver who's diving at 500 feet, he gets narcosis.
[02:47:38.232 --> 02:47:42.474]  He gets high from the mixture he's breathing from the tank.
[02:47:42.514 --> 02:47:49.139]  And it seems like people in high places get delusional throughout history on these power trips and think they're invincible.
[02:47:49.159 --> 02:47:50.440]  In fact, it always happens.
[02:47:50.480 --> 02:47:52.741]  Hitler attacking four countries at the same time.
[02:47:53.402 --> 02:47:56.524]  It seems like, though, we're starting to see that out of Washington itself.
[02:47:56.544 --> 02:47:58.745]  Do you think they're ever going to come back to ground?
[02:47:58.805 --> 02:48:00.406]  Or is it just going to have to collide?
[02:48:01.807 --> 02:48:11.393]  Let's hope they come to their senses because one day I think these guys are ready to start a war with Iran or they're ready to start a war with Syria or North Korea or China.
[02:48:11.753 --> 02:48:12.554]  Then the next day I think...
[02:48:13.188 --> 02:48:14.469]  They can't possibly do that.
[02:48:14.569 --> 02:48:15.710]  It's so insane.
[02:48:16.010 --> 02:48:16.931]  We don't have the money.
[02:48:16.971 --> 02:48:17.852]  We don't have the troops.
[02:48:18.212 --> 02:48:23.217]  We probably don't even have the ammunition anymore because they consume so much every single day.
[02:48:23.857 --> 02:48:28.781]  But, if they are truly delusional, they just might do something that's totally irrational.
[02:48:29.282 --> 02:48:32.705]  Well, I mean, the top army people told them don't invade Iraq, and they did it.
[02:48:32.965 --> 02:48:34.186]  Sir, a quick break.
[02:48:34.206 --> 02:48:35.327]  Just a few minutes on the other side.
[02:48:35.367 --> 02:48:38.009]  I want to talk about where your campaign's going, how folks can support it.
[02:48:38.350 --> 02:48:39.831]  On the other side, stay with us, Congressman.
[02:48:46.700 --> 02:48:49.581]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:49.821 --> 02:48:51.402]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:51.742 --> 02:48:56.423]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:56.763 --> 02:49:03.466]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:49:03.806 --> 02:49:05.787]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:49:05.987 --> 02:49:08.849]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:08.949 --> 02:49:13.591]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:13.791 --> 02:49:18.213]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:18.453 --> 02:49:25.657]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[02:49:45.999 --> 02:49:51.204]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:51.364 --> 02:49:59.453]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:49:59.713 --> 02:50:06.780]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:06.940 --> 02:50:07.860]  We're good to go!
[02:50:28.507 --> 02:50:35.694]  Let's order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:50:55.664 --> 02:51:02.033]  We provide outstanding products like ECAC, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[02:51:02.393 --> 02:51:02.993]  I think so.
[02:51:22.619 --> 02:51:22.839]  I think so.
[02:51:50.269 --> 02:51:56.353]  S1145, the Mind Control Thought Crime Bill, could go to the full Senate vote at any time.
[02:51:56.613 --> 02:51:58.194]  So folks, I don't know when it's going to happen.
[02:51:58.234 --> 02:51:59.515]  It could happen today, tomorrow, next week.
[02:52:00.155 --> 02:52:01.236]  So be aware of that.
[02:52:01.656 --> 02:52:06.819]  Ron Paul had Loving Mr. DeLay rewrite his district against the Congressman.
[02:52:07.060 --> 02:52:17.106]  Oh yeah, they don't just write him for the Republicans, they write him against people like Ron Paul, putting his district into Galveston, which is predominantly Liberal Democrat, and they're running some neo-con against him.
[02:52:18.066 --> 02:52:19.788]  And so people need to support Ron this year.
[02:52:19.848 --> 02:52:22.089]  They're really going to come after him, as they've done in the past.
[02:52:22.710 --> 02:52:29.815]  Congressman, folks can call 1-800-Ron-Paul, 1-800-Ron-Paul, or they can go to libertycommittee.org, can't they?
[02:52:30.175 --> 02:52:34.498]  That is right, and you can find me there and communicate with me if you'd like to get on my list.
[02:52:35.247 --> 02:52:38.109]  1-800-RonPaul or LibertyCommittee.org.
[02:52:38.429 --> 02:52:45.793]  I know you've got faith in the future of this country, and obviously Bush is a puppet of private interest, and so he's like a birdcage liner that can put a new one in.
[02:52:46.413 --> 02:52:50.515]  But, I mean, really, isn't it time to move for impeachment of Bush?
[02:52:50.555 --> 02:52:59.160]  We've got him bringing forward this new Supreme Court nominee, we've got him calling for martial law, we've got him saying torture's good, we've got him calling for amnesty.
[02:52:59.180 --> 02:53:01.841]  I mean, isn't that a reason?
[02:53:02.162 --> 02:53:04.623]  Yeah, well, I think legalistically there's enough
[02:53:05.484 --> 02:53:06.625]  Uh, evidence there.
[02:53:06.705 --> 02:53:10.749]  I think in a practical political sense and impeachment is a political process.
[02:53:10.809 --> 02:53:17.435]  It's probably nowhere close, uh, because, uh, you know, there's a Republican Congress and that's one reason.
[02:53:17.455 --> 02:53:21.219]  And the second, uh, is that, um,
[02:53:22.994 --> 02:53:24.895]  It's not going to go anywhere.
[02:53:25.155 --> 02:53:26.355]  That's the whole problem.
[02:53:26.675 --> 02:53:30.656]  And if he did happen to be successful, you're going to end up with Dick Cheney!
[02:53:31.917 --> 02:53:32.837]  And he's worse!
[02:53:33.597 --> 02:53:34.657]  What about these indictments?
[02:53:34.717 --> 02:53:35.477]  Last question.
[02:53:35.497 --> 02:53:40.159]  I mean, there's crystals on Fox News saying there's going to be indictments in the next few weeks.
[02:53:41.219 --> 02:53:47.600]  I think there's a lot more excitement coming, and it's not going to be good for the Republicans.
[02:53:47.740 --> 02:53:48.421]  What are you hearing?
[02:53:50.490 --> 02:53:57.612]  My thing that I hear has to do with Karl Rove and Abramoff is that's much, much worse than anybody believes.
[02:53:57.632 --> 02:53:59.353]  And it involves delay as well.
[02:54:00.453 --> 02:54:07.416]  And that type of indictment will be much more serious than the indictment of shifting campaign funds around.
[02:54:07.616 --> 02:54:10.997]  So is it something completely separate from what we've even been hearing?
[02:54:11.577 --> 02:54:16.639]  Well, we've heard about Abramoff, the lobbyist, the one that got all that money from the Indian reservations.
[02:54:17.483 --> 02:54:26.334]  And he was the one that ran the campaign in South Carolina and really went after John McCain, and John McCain's the one who's investigating Abramoff.
[02:54:26.774 --> 02:54:31.039]  So there's some real political infighting there that could be very interesting.
[02:54:31.540 --> 02:54:35.484]  And then Karl Rove may be indicted of the Plame Affair.
[02:54:37.122 --> 02:54:39.464]  I don't think anybody doubts that he was involved.
[02:54:39.504 --> 02:54:40.825]  What about Scooter Libby?
[02:54:41.385 --> 02:54:44.127]  I think pretty much he was involved too.
[02:54:44.207 --> 02:54:46.149]  Whether they get an indictment on him will be another thing.
[02:54:46.169 --> 02:54:48.651]  But he's Dick Cheney's buddy.
[02:54:49.501 --> 02:54:53.522]  And they're the ones who really, really have a lot of power and clout.
[02:54:53.542 --> 02:54:55.543]  What do we know about Fitzgerald, the U.S.
[02:54:55.603 --> 02:54:56.003]  Attorney?
[02:54:56.043 --> 02:54:57.324]  Don't know much about him.
[02:54:57.624 --> 02:54:59.344]  I just hope he's an honest guy.
[02:55:00.144 --> 02:55:03.285]  But he seems to be pursuing this, so we'll see what happens.
[02:55:03.365 --> 02:55:09.287]  If it all dissipates in about two days and we didn't find anything, then you can be suspicious again.
[02:55:09.307 --> 02:55:11.088]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:55:11.108 --> 02:55:12.768]  I'm not going to hold my breath.
[02:55:13.089 --> 02:55:16.850]  I mean, look at how George Bush protected Bill Clinton when Bill Clinton left office.
[02:55:18.647 --> 02:55:20.388]  But it would be good to see somebody get in trouble.
[02:55:20.428 --> 02:55:30.210]  Well, Congressman, I really appreciate you spending the time, and God bless you, and we're all going to try to support you over at LibertyCommittee.org or 1-800-RonPaul, and thanks for spending time.
[02:55:30.250 --> 02:55:30.350]  Okay.
[02:55:30.470 --> 02:55:30.810]  Thank you.
[02:55:30.870 --> 02:55:31.190]  Bye-bye.
[02:55:31.350 --> 02:55:31.730]  Take care.
[02:55:32.471 --> 02:55:34.331]  We're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:34.431 --> 02:55:37.752]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:55:39.227 --> 02:55:41.468]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2, Central Standard Time.
[02:55:41.788 --> 02:55:48.650]  I want to thank all those of you that came out to see Order of Death, and then the re-edited, remastered Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grub last night.
[02:55:48.870 --> 02:55:49.631]  That was wonderful.
[02:55:49.711 --> 02:55:50.591]  Thanks for all the support.
[02:55:50.611 --> 02:55:57.613]  We're going to have one more showing now, coming up not this Thursday, but next Thursday, with the 26th and 7th.
[02:55:57.633 --> 02:56:02.135]  And you can get those tickets now at InfoWars.com, but you better hurry and do it, because they'll sell out quick as well.

[02:56:17.834 --> 02:56:21.034]  Well, the congressman talking about one world government and total martial law.
[02:56:21.074 --> 02:56:21.694]  Pretty interesting.
[02:56:21.895 --> 02:56:22.335]  God bless.
[02:56:22.375 --> 02:56:22.795]  Take care.
