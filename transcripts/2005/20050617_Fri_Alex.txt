[00:00:05.677 --> 00:00:06.338]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.998 --> 00:00:08.059]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:09.880]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.501 --> 00:00:11.361]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.082 --> 00:00:13.603]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.643 --> 00:00:17.285]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.826 --> 00:00:22.009]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:26.432]  Well, I got to sleep at 6 a.m.
[00:00:26.512 --> 00:00:27.753]  today.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.981]  Got up at 8.30.
[00:00:39.382 --> 00:00:40.283]  But I feel good.
[00:00:40.303 --> 00:00:44.405]  I got some of the magic coffee beans in me.
[00:00:45.065 --> 00:00:48.146]  Had a cup of coffee starting to get into my bloodstream here.
[00:00:48.967 --> 00:00:50.608]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:50.628 --> 00:00:52.188]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:52.248 --> 00:00:53.429]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.492]  Four-hour debate last night on Coast to Coast AM.
[00:00:59.572 --> 00:01:03.634]  And before I got on there with Professor David Ray Griffin...
[00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:08.106]  And Mike Levine and another individual.
[00:01:08.506 --> 00:01:18.990]  They had Mr. Reynolds on, one of the former high-level Bush administration officials, going over the evidence of controlled demolition.
[00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.632]  So I've probably gotten about 150 emails on it.
[00:01:22.732 --> 00:01:24.212]  I think two of them are negative.
[00:01:24.252 --> 00:01:29.374]  Everybody is saying that myself and Avery Griffin handily won the debate.
[00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:45.570]  Out of all the calls they took before we got on, and the hour of calls they took in the fourth, or it was actually the fifth hour, but the fourth hour of our debate, one person slightly disagreed with the view that the government was involved in the attacks.
[00:01:46.491 --> 00:01:49.113]  Almost all the callers agreed with David Ray Griffin and myself.
[00:01:49.153 --> 00:01:50.934]  In fact, everybody but one person.
[00:01:51.614 --> 00:01:56.178]  And again, out of over 100 emails, I've got two emails here that...
[00:01:57.924 --> 00:02:05.367]  Folks, I've got to tell you, and I've got a bunch of news I'm going to get into today, but I know a lot of you want to call in about the debate last night.
[00:02:05.387 --> 00:02:06.888]  You're welcome to do that at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:06.908 --> 00:02:11.330]  I'm going to try to lean on the audience.
[00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.251]  Most people would not be doing a broadcast on two hours sleep.
[00:02:16.072 --> 00:02:22.554]  I also, of course, did my own radio show yesterday and a movie showing, a speech and question and answer.
[00:02:23.295 --> 00:02:25.816]  So I am really burning the candle at both ends.
[00:02:26.036 --> 00:02:26.196]  But...
[00:02:27.557 --> 00:02:41.480]  I don't want to spend all day on it, but this former Nightline producer, individual, Peter Lance, continually, out of the gates, savaged me and tried to have personal attacks, which I ignored.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.281]  I mean, that's just all he did, basically, was go after myself.
[00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:49.942]  And I really didn't even defend myself.
[00:02:50.242 --> 00:02:57.203]  I mean, I know people are frustrated by his behavior, but he didn't really have any evidence to stand on
[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.321]  And he seemed panicked.
[00:03:01.201 --> 00:03:02.422]  Very, very upset.
[00:03:04.342 --> 00:03:06.223]  And it went on and on and on.
[00:03:07.004 --> 00:03:08.624]  But the evidence did get out.
[00:03:08.944 --> 00:03:10.845]  A lot of key information did get out.
[00:03:10.905 --> 00:03:14.527]  And Coast to Coast AM is the second biggest radio show in the country.
[00:03:15.167 --> 00:03:17.588]  It goes Rush Limbaugh and then Coast to Coast AM.
[00:03:18.088 --> 00:03:21.890]  They have, what is it, 14 to 16 million listeners per hour.
[00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:29.134]  To give you an example, Bill O'Reilly, in the hour of his show, highest ratings he ever gets, 2.7 million.
[00:03:29.934 --> 00:03:32.856]  MSNBC's latest top numbers, 232,000.
[00:03:33.196 --> 00:03:36.538]  Those were published two days ago.
[00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:48.566]  I mean, to give you an idea of the size of that audience on Coast to Coast AM, and George is a real gentleman, very fair, I'm very impressed by his courage to have David Ray Griffin and myself on.
[00:03:49.686 --> 00:03:50.707]  Mr. Levine...
[00:03:51.636 --> 00:03:55.719]  Agreed with us on about 80% of what we were bringing forward.
[00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:57.601]  He was a very gentlemanly fellow.
[00:03:58.281 --> 00:04:05.047]  But again, I think I'll try to get Peter Lance on sometime if he really wants to have a real debate with me and not scream and yell and name call.
[00:04:06.148 --> 00:04:08.670]  But of course, then I was evil any time I would respond to him.
[00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.792]  I mean, I would talk about Gulf of Tonkin.
[00:04:11.832 --> 00:04:12.993]  He called it a conspiracy theory.
[00:04:13.934 --> 00:04:16.076]  I mean, the LBJ presidential tapes have been released.
[00:04:16.156 --> 00:04:17.537]  I'd talk about Northwoods.
[00:04:17.597 --> 00:04:20.099]  I'd talk about anything, basically.
[00:04:20.894 --> 00:04:23.535]  And I talk about Bin Laden being CIA.
[00:04:23.595 --> 00:04:25.096]  I mean, it just went on and on.
[00:04:25.116 --> 00:04:30.819]  He'd go unbelievable, preposterous, just over and over and over again.
[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.921]  It was an amazing, amazing debate.
[00:04:36.522 --> 00:04:41.924]  I tell you, it was 46 minutes into the first hour of the debate before I even got to chime in.
[00:04:41.944 --> 00:04:45.686]  And I was like a caged lion.
[00:04:46.566 --> 00:04:49.908]  But I controlled myself better than I thought I would.
[00:04:51.043 --> 00:04:57.885]  Hey, before you criticize the job I did for responding to Lance a little bit, walk a mile in my shoes.
[00:05:02.378 --> 00:05:05.240]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.180]  Hello, my friends.
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.081]  Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.401 --> 00:05:12.083]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.424 --> 00:05:16.866]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:05:17.266 --> 00:05:21.489]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:22.329]  The Constitution...
[00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:26.332]  And uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:26.352 --> 00:05:28.254]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:05:28.274 --> 00:05:29.935]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[00:06:01.317 --> 00:06:01.738]  Thank you.
[00:06:16.317 --> 00:06:16.897]  We're good to go.

[00:06:50.402 --> 00:06:51.103]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:01.337 --> 00:07:06.741]  Did you know that you can trace every sickness, every disease, and every ailment ultimately to mineral deficiency?
[00:07:06.881 --> 00:07:15.188]  Did you also know that 99% of American people are deficient in minerals and a marked deficiency in any one of the more important elements actually results in disease?
[00:07:15.408 --> 00:07:17.009]  More than likely, this includes you.
[00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:20.312]  Arm yourself with the minerals you need from Mother Earth Minerals.
[00:07:20.572 --> 00:07:33.675]  Mother Earth Minerals specializes in providing the primary building blocks for nutritional supplementation, including liquid, water-soluble, elemental mineral suspensions, contain the essential nutrients required for the proper function of muscles, nerves, blood vessels, and organs.
[00:07:33.975 --> 00:07:42.397]  Founder Tru Ott, PhD, is so confident that you will be pleased from the results of supplementing your diet with Mother Earth Minerals that he offers an unconditional guarantee.

[00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:04.210]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.671]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:25.679 --> 00:08:30.721]  Well, last night we had a historic debate on the second biggest radio show in the country.
[00:08:31.841 --> 00:08:36.803]  Coast to Coast AM, a special five-hour live show that George Norrie had.
[00:08:37.544 --> 00:08:49.709]  In the first 30 minutes, he had Mr. Reynolds, who, again, worked at the highest levels of the Bush administration, who's gone public about the clear evidence of controlled demolition and government complicity in 9-11.
[00:08:50.549 --> 00:08:56.872]  And then it was myself and Professor David Ray Griffin up against two other individuals.
[00:08:57.992 --> 00:08:58.793]  And I have to say that...
[00:09:00.163 --> 00:09:08.065]  Mike Levine did a pretty good job, agreed with us on most issues, former DEA agent, covert operator, syndicate talk show host.
[00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:09.525]  Nice fella.
[00:09:09.545 --> 00:09:11.405]  I mean, he was there really to debate.
[00:09:12.866 --> 00:09:23.048]  I was blown away by the savage attacks that I underwent by Peter Lance, the big-time ABC news producer.
[00:09:25.308 --> 00:09:30.331]  And, but again, I mean, he had to do that because he couldn't debate the facts or the evidence of the issues.
[00:09:30.351 --> 00:09:37.616]  And I'm going to try to get him on this broadcast where it's just he and I for an hour or two, if he'll come on and do it.
[00:09:38.497 --> 00:09:43.340]  And we'll have a real debate where, you know, he just can't sit there in a name call.
[00:09:44.961 --> 00:09:50.245]  All that aside, again, I'll say it, George Norrie was extremely fair and honest.
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:58.382]  By the end of the night, I mean, it emerged that all the panelists believe the government had prior knowledge and stood to gain and let it happen.
[00:09:58.902 --> 00:10:00.622]  The only debate was, did they engineer it?
[00:10:00.662 --> 00:10:01.482]  And clearly they did.
[00:10:01.502 --> 00:10:10.085]  So I know we already have loaded phone lines with Scott and Elizabeth and Mark and Brett and many, many others that are patiently holding.
[00:10:11.985 --> 00:10:14.146]  I want to get into the president's problems.
[00:10:14.166 --> 00:10:19.227]  You know, he says he has all this political capital, but only 39% approve of his handling of the economy, 39%.
[00:10:20.922 --> 00:10:23.004]  Approve of his handling of the foreign policy.
[00:10:23.264 --> 00:10:25.905]  37% approve of his handling of the Iraq War.
[00:10:26.006 --> 00:10:28.767]  Only 25% of his handling of Social Security.
[00:10:29.508 --> 00:10:34.391]  Only the campaign against terrorism gets the approval of more than half those questioned.
[00:10:36.493 --> 00:10:38.234]  That's through fear and mind control.
[00:10:39.995 --> 00:10:46.740]  White House is castigating Durbin's comments on Camp X-Ray at Guantanamo being a death camp.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.321]  Well, a bunch of people have died in there, and they are torturing them.
[00:10:49.642 --> 00:10:50.202]  That's admitted.
[00:10:51.075 --> 00:10:51.836]  So we'll talk about it.
[00:11:15.067 --> 00:11:16.368]  Involving illegal aliens.
[00:11:16.548 --> 00:11:17.769]  This is very good news.
[00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:21.191]  Israel to build an underwater barrier to prevent attacks.
[00:11:22.051 --> 00:11:24.572]  But we can't even have a fence in this country.
[00:11:26.153 --> 00:11:28.314]  And all of these earthquakes in California.
[00:11:28.334 --> 00:11:29.975]  I mean, they had another big one last night.
[00:11:30.235 --> 00:11:31.056]  It's getting scary.
[00:11:32.437 --> 00:11:34.718]  Are these just tremors before something bigger?
[00:11:36.719 --> 00:11:39.220]  Also, a lot of cuts in the federal government.
[00:11:39.661 --> 00:11:40.661]  And then we talk about cuts.
[00:11:40.701 --> 00:11:42.022]  Really, the budget's ballooning, but...
[00:11:43.068 --> 00:11:45.630]  Future giant laser threatened by cuts.
[00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:50.632]  Also, two PETA employees arrested on animal cruelty charges in North Carolina.
[00:11:52.053 --> 00:12:00.278]  Hundreds of dead animals thrown into these bins.
[00:12:00.298 --> 00:12:03.319]  They've been caught doing it before, but this time a whole bunch of dead animals.
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.560]  And I know somebody who worked for PETA.
[00:12:05.841 --> 00:12:06.521]  Pretty high level.
[00:12:07.655 --> 00:12:11.659]  And she quit when she found out they gobbled cheeseburgers in the back room.
[00:12:11.679 --> 00:12:14.181]  It was like a religious sacrament to gobble meat.
[00:12:17.584 --> 00:12:20.567]  It's like a weird euthanasia of animal cult.
[00:12:21.248 --> 00:12:23.910]  They would like pressure employees to kill their animals.
[00:12:25.391 --> 00:12:26.012]  I'm not kidding.
[00:12:26.032 --> 00:12:28.074]  We'll probably be having an individual on next week.
[00:12:28.829 --> 00:12:30.070]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:41.540]  Two Hampton Roads employees of Norfolk-based People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals have been charged in North Carolina with animal cruelty after dumping dead dogs and cats in a shopping center garbage bin, police said Thursday.
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:50.608]  Investigators staked out the bin after discovering the dead animals had been dumped there every Wednesday for the past four weeks, and it totaled in the hundreds.
[00:12:51.204 --> 00:12:56.588]  Police found 18 dead animals just in one dumping and 13 more in a van registered to PETA.
[00:12:57.029 --> 00:13:03.694]  The animals were from animal shelters in Northampton and Birtle counties in North Carolina.
[00:13:03.734 --> 00:13:08.718]  Police said the two were picked up animals to be brought back to PETA headquarters for euthanization.
[00:13:09.018 --> 00:13:11.600]  PETA President Ingrid Newkirk said Thursday.
[00:13:12.481 --> 00:13:14.783]  So they go out and get animals and then come and kill them.
[00:13:16.262 --> 00:13:18.303]  Again, I know someone who worked in that office.
[00:13:18.864 --> 00:13:21.406]  They were constantly being pressured to kill their cats and dogs.
[00:13:22.366 --> 00:13:23.788]  Their own personal animals, folks.
[00:13:23.808 --> 00:13:24.928]  This is bizarro.
[00:13:25.549 --> 00:13:27.250]  These guys are a pack of loons.
[00:13:28.191 --> 00:13:32.595]  Neither police nor PETA offered any theory of why the animals might have been dumped.
[00:13:34.876 --> 00:13:41.481]  Local officials and veterinarians said they were told that PETA would find homes for the animals, not euthanize them.
[00:13:41.522 --> 00:13:44.584]  I mean, think of the trouble they went through to go get these animals, to kill them.
[00:13:45.276 --> 00:13:48.818]  PETA has scheduled a news conference for Friday afternoon to discuss the charges.
[00:13:50.859 --> 00:13:58.284]  And again, just multiple cases of dumping, even before they first got the reports, they've now found out about a bunch of other cases.
[00:13:58.304 --> 00:13:59.425]  I have several articles on this.
[00:14:01.306 --> 00:14:02.006]  Very weird.
[00:14:02.126 --> 00:14:03.427]  And I've mentioned this before.
[00:14:04.288 --> 00:14:05.669]  Look, I'll just be honest with you.
[00:14:06.909 --> 00:14:12.533]  My wife was offered a book deal, a very lucrative one, five years ago, and I told her to turn it down.
[00:14:13.556 --> 00:14:15.877]  Because I didn't want to get involved in all of this.
[00:14:17.298 --> 00:14:18.719]  But let's just be honest.
[00:14:18.879 --> 00:14:20.300]  My wife worked for PETA.
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:22.201]  She was young.
[00:14:22.381 --> 00:14:25.363]  She had been at college at UT, been in college in Europe.
[00:14:26.103 --> 00:14:27.504]  And she'd come back to Norfolk.
[00:14:29.025 --> 00:14:30.866]  And they recruited her out of college.
[00:14:30.966 --> 00:14:32.146]  Oh, she loved animals.
[00:14:32.487 --> 00:14:34.147]  Oh, we're just going to save little puppies.
[00:14:34.348 --> 00:14:35.988]  They showed her the slaughterhouse footage.
[00:14:36.669 --> 00:14:39.831]  And she went and worked for them for, I don't know, a couple years.
[00:14:39.971 --> 00:14:40.851]  She's very famous.
[00:14:42.052 --> 00:14:42.112]  Uh...
[00:14:42.893 --> 00:14:45.995]  She's the lady that threw red paint on people and dead raccoons.
[00:14:46.455 --> 00:14:48.376]  She's the lady that went to Japan.
[00:14:48.416 --> 00:14:52.639]  She's been on more TV and radio in some cases than I have.
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.200]  And that's something I've never talked about.
[00:14:55.801 --> 00:14:57.302]  I just say I have sources in PETA.
[00:14:59.843 --> 00:15:02.645]  And of course now she eats meat and knows it's all propaganda.
[00:15:02.665 --> 00:15:06.987]  She doesn't eat a lot of meat, but she's a very intelligent lady.
[00:15:07.428 --> 00:15:11.290]  She was young, loves animals, a very caring, compassionate person.
[00:15:12.988 --> 00:15:16.831]  And I might as well, I guess, I don't know why we didn't do that book.
[00:15:17.432 --> 00:15:18.993]  We had the deal, the book deal.
[00:15:20.534 --> 00:15:27.100]  Because some big publishers have been doing research on individuals and knew about some of her private statements and we were contacted.
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:32.004]  I mean, we had the deal ready to be inked and we turned down a lot of money.
[00:15:33.065 --> 00:15:38.389]  Just because I said we've got to fight the New World Order, we've got to fight government-sponsored terrorism, we've got bigger fish to fry.
[00:15:39.746 --> 00:15:45.688]  But this does show just the craziness of the eugenics and the bioethicist crowd.
[00:15:45.968 --> 00:15:52.790]  They're big supporters of Dr. Peter Singer, who calls babies mackerel and old people worthless and retarded children subhuman.
[00:15:54.211 --> 00:15:56.212]  And he's at Princeton and gets all this funding.
[00:15:56.392 --> 00:15:57.972]  I mean, they're big supporters of him.
[00:15:58.332 --> 00:15:59.473]  They're extinctionists.
[00:16:00.433 --> 00:16:03.534]  And the stories my wife told me
[00:16:04.562 --> 00:16:06.984]  Folks, what I've told you is the tip of the iceberg.
[00:16:07.324 --> 00:16:19.533]  And she didn't learn this until she'd been there, I don't know, a year or a half or so, and they wanted her to move up and to be part of their higher-level structure with Ingrid Newkirk there at PETA.
[00:16:20.273 --> 00:16:23.496]  And when she saw it, I mean, it blew her away.
[00:16:23.656 --> 00:16:27.959]  Gobbling cheeseburgers in the back room, again, it's like some type of religious sacrament.
[00:16:28.339 --> 00:16:29.100]  Gobbling meat.
[00:16:30.699 --> 00:16:34.260]  She was totally blown away, pressuring the people to kill their animals.
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.121]  And quite frankly, I just didn't want to get tied up in some big rat snarl with them.
[00:16:39.421 --> 00:16:40.362]  But, I mean, here it is.
[00:16:41.822 --> 00:16:42.562]  She told me this.
[00:16:42.602 --> 00:16:45.103]  She said that she found out they go out to animal shelters.
[00:16:47.523 --> 00:16:51.264]  She never did this, but she started, you know, I mean, it was like a weird movie or something.
[00:16:51.744 --> 00:16:53.225]  You know, some weird mystery movie.
[00:16:53.725 --> 00:16:57.486]  They would go out and get animals from animal shelters, and then, oh, now we have to euthanize them.
[00:16:58.126 --> 00:16:59.186]  She's like, I'm out of here.
[00:16:59.955 --> 00:17:00.535]  I'm out of here.
[00:17:01.435 --> 00:17:02.196]  I'm not doing this.
[00:17:02.996 --> 00:17:05.076]  I'm not going to be around this.
[00:17:07.437 --> 00:17:07.977]  Oh, boy.
[00:17:07.997 --> 00:17:08.377]  I don't know.
[00:17:08.417 --> 00:17:09.778]  That was probably ten years ago.
[00:17:09.798 --> 00:17:11.518]  All right.
[00:17:11.578 --> 00:17:12.018]  So there.
[00:17:12.098 --> 00:17:13.038]  I've talked about it.
[00:17:14.179 --> 00:17:16.859]  And if she wants to come on, she's welcome to.
[00:17:16.919 --> 00:17:19.260]  She wanted to come on today, and I said, let's think about it.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.541]  Well, now I've thought about it, and now I've spilt the beans.
[00:17:24.525 --> 00:17:27.687]  But these people are out of control, folks.
[00:17:28.287 --> 00:17:29.728]  They could care less about animals.
[00:17:29.828 --> 00:17:32.649]  It is a eugenics propaganda arm.
[00:17:35.151 --> 00:17:39.293]  There's a bunch of other news here, but we're going to go to your calls now and talk about 9-11.
[00:17:40.153 --> 00:17:42.014]  Talk about whatever issues you wish to discuss.
[00:17:42.594 --> 00:17:44.195]  Scott in Michigan, you're on the air.
[00:17:44.275 --> 00:17:44.736]  Go ahead.
[00:17:45.516 --> 00:17:45.936]  Hey, Alex.
[00:17:45.996 --> 00:17:49.338]  I'd like to congratulate you on a very well job done last night on Coast to Coast.
[00:17:49.418 --> 00:17:51.939]  I listened to the first two hours before I fell asleep.
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:53.020]  But, uh...
[00:17:54.642 --> 00:17:59.384]  Anyways, on your movie, Mass of the Terror, you gave out the White House switchboard number, you know?
[00:18:00.105 --> 00:18:04.626]  I called that yesterday and I left a pleasant message for President Bush, if you would.
[00:18:05.147 --> 00:18:14.691]  Well, that's a clip in the film from two months before 9-11 when I said, call the White House, tell them don't use their CIA asset bin Laden to attack the World Trade Center.
[00:18:15.591 --> 00:18:22.414]  Yeah, well, I didn't use the exact type thing ever, but ever since 9-11 has been done, now I told them that you better come clean of 9-11.
[00:18:23.652 --> 00:18:27.413]  And I told him that I'm a 14-year-old kid who's probably like the future of this nation.
[00:18:27.453 --> 00:18:28.993]  Every single kid's the future of this nation.
[00:18:29.653 --> 00:18:34.474]  And I'm not going to have some tyrant take away our liberties.
[00:18:35.174 --> 00:18:39.595]  And I said that if my life's ever threatened or anything like that, I'll be ready to take up arms and start shooting people.
[00:18:39.615 --> 00:18:43.576]  Well, sir, please don't talk like that, and I appreciate your call.
[00:18:43.696 --> 00:18:44.657]  Let me advise you.
[00:18:45.357 --> 00:18:49.778]  Never call any government servant and say things like that.
[00:18:49.798 --> 00:18:50.758]  I know you're 14, you're angry.
[00:18:52.037 --> 00:18:53.618]  President Bush is just a puppet.
[00:18:55.098 --> 00:18:56.118]  And I could hear it in your voice.
[00:18:56.198 --> 00:18:57.459]  Boy, I just knew that was going there.
[00:18:58.639 --> 00:19:02.660]  You better hope they don't have caller ID and don't trace that back to you.
[00:19:03.801 --> 00:19:04.181]  Okay?
[00:19:05.801 --> 00:19:07.602]  That is the last thing you want to do.
[00:19:08.702 --> 00:19:09.082]  Alright?
[00:19:09.322 --> 00:19:11.143]  And I know you don't mean the things you just said.
[00:19:12.903 --> 00:19:18.245]  So... Scott, again, I'm not trying to castigate you or put you down.
[00:19:18.665 --> 00:19:19.285]  You're young.
[00:19:20.446 --> 00:19:20.586]  And...
[00:19:21.733 --> 00:19:25.097]  You just need to be careful, and you don't need to get hot-headed about all of this.
[00:19:25.157 --> 00:19:27.740]  And, of course, I'm the pot calling the kettle black.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.122]  This is all very upsetting.
[00:19:29.642 --> 00:19:30.763]  We should be upset about it.
[00:19:31.584 --> 00:19:35.989]  We'll come back and talk to Elizabeth Mark, Brett Russell, many, many others.
[00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:36.070]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:49.353]  We, for the debate last night, put a special 9-11 retrospective up on personplanet.com and infowars.com and personplanet.tv and infowars.net.
[00:19:49.853 --> 00:19:51.014]  Be sure and check the site.
[00:19:51.054 --> 00:19:52.834]  It'll only be like that for another day or so.
[00:19:53.254 --> 00:19:55.375]  Then we'll go back to the normal full news format.
[00:19:55.395 --> 00:19:56.875]  All right, we'll be right back.
[00:19:56.895 --> 00:19:57.236]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.405 --> 00:20:04.787]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[00:20:05.027 --> 00:20:05.367]  Why?
[00:20:05.387 --> 00:20:08.329]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[00:20:08.409 --> 00:20:13.352]  Cardivite drops and capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.
[00:20:13.472 --> 00:20:23.178]  The all-natural ingredients in cardivite begin immediately working to increase metabolism in your heart muscle tissue, mitigating heart rhythm abnormalities, and improving oxygen and blood flow in the heart.
[00:20:23.358 --> 00:20:30.822]  Right now, as a special for GCN listeners, you'll get a four-month supply for only $99 plus shipping, a 30% savings off the regular price.
[00:20:30.962 --> 00:20:32.182]  Don't let heart disease beat you.
[00:20:32.202 --> 00:20:35.443]  Beat the odds and do your body right with Cardivite.
[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:02.100]  Terrorism.
[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:03.001]  Terrorism.
[00:21:03.121 --> 00:21:03.961]  Chemical attacks.
[00:21:04.021 --> 00:21:04.701]  Dirty bombs.
[00:21:04.761 --> 00:21:05.182]  Fallout.
[00:21:05.282 --> 00:21:06.262]  Biological attack.
[00:21:06.442 --> 00:21:07.002]  Anthrax.
[00:21:07.062 --> 00:21:09.163]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[00:21:09.423 --> 00:21:11.024]  Alarming words for our time.
[00:21:11.264 --> 00:21:13.745]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:21:14.125 --> 00:21:28.711]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:21:28.751 --> 00:21:29.071]  government.
[00:21:29.231 --> 00:21:31.032]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:21:31.412 --> 00:21:37.314]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:21:37.475 --> 00:21:41.976]  If you're not the type who waits until it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[00:21:42.216 --> 00:21:48.919]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:21:48.999 --> 00:21:51.620]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:22:01.041 --> 00:22:02.523]  To the farthest corners of the earth.
[00:22:02.823 --> 00:22:07.408]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[00:22:07.748 --> 00:22:10.091]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[00:22:10.311 --> 00:22:11.852]  Achieve financial independence.
[00:22:12.233 --> 00:22:17.378]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a north star.
[00:22:17.619 --> 00:22:18.840]  Get the Red Book of U.S.
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:21.603]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.
[00:22:22.003 --> 00:22:27.930]  Right now, Midas Resources is offering the 2005 edition of the Red Book, along with a silver dollar for only $22.95.
[00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:29.051]  Call them today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:29.071 --> 00:22:29.352]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:29.372 --> 00:22:33.016]  I can tell you there will be storms ahead, but with real money as your base, liberty will be your fate.
[00:22:41.545 --> 00:22:48.208]  Leave the fiat currency behind and call Midas Resources to get your red book along with that silver dollar for only $22.95.
[00:22:48.428 --> 00:22:49.108]  Get the map.
[00:22:49.128 --> 00:22:51.529]  Start your journey to financial independence today.
[00:22:51.749 --> 00:22:52.749]  The time is now.
[00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:54.050]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:55.971 --> 00:22:59.092]  Get your red book now and you'll weather any storm that comes your way.
[00:23:00.592 --> 00:23:03.977]  To history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[00:23:17.316 --> 00:23:17.756]  We're good to go.
[00:23:34.821 --> 00:23:35.281]  We're good to go.
[00:23:35.301 --> 00:23:35.722]  We're good to go.
[00:23:35.742 --> 00:23:36.142]  We're good to go.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.662]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:24:04.682 --> 00:24:08.584]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:09.344 --> 00:24:12.826]  Alright, let's take a lot of calls here.
[00:24:12.866 --> 00:24:17.789]  Go through a lot of listeners that want to respond to any of the news I've mentioned or the debate last night.
[00:24:18.349 --> 00:24:19.770]  Elizabeth in Pennsylvania.
[00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:21.131]  Go ahead, Elizabeth.
[00:24:21.811 --> 00:24:22.852]  Yeah, Alex.
[00:24:22.932 --> 00:24:24.993]  First time caller, long time listener.
[00:24:25.133 --> 00:24:25.513]  Welcome.
[00:24:26.093 --> 00:24:30.556]  I heard last night, or at least most of it, and while you say...
[00:24:31.129 --> 00:24:33.510]  You thought that George Norrie was, you know, fair.
[00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:41.173]  I think he only did a fair job of controlling what Mr. Lance, wasn't that his name?
[00:24:42.434 --> 00:24:43.014]  Lance, was it?
[00:24:43.374 --> 00:24:43.774]  Yes.
[00:24:44.935 --> 00:24:51.657]  He may have tried, but that guy not only talked over you, which is not an easy feat, Alex, right?
[00:24:52.077 --> 00:24:53.138]  To talk over you.
[00:24:54.018 --> 00:24:55.979]  Because you express yourself well.
[00:24:56.619 --> 00:24:57.700]  But that guy...
[00:24:59.048 --> 00:25:08.140]  No matter how many documents you presented, facts you presented, he not only made light of it, he tried to make fun of it, rip it apart.
[00:25:08.741 --> 00:25:12.426]  And when George Norrie said, no attacks, he kept attacking it.
[00:25:13.061 --> 00:25:16.724]  And you didn't attack, at least the portion I heard, and I heard most of it.
[00:25:16.985 --> 00:25:29.156]  Well, he finally attacked in the special fifth hour, 20 minutes towards the end, one more time, and George just said, that's it, cut him off, didn't even let the other guy really respond, and then let me.
[00:25:29.916 --> 00:25:31.416]  I have basically the final word.
[00:25:31.676 --> 00:25:32.236]  That's good.
[00:25:32.556 --> 00:25:36.357]  All the callers came in after that and said, man, what's wrong with that Lance guy?
[00:25:36.757 --> 00:25:38.898]  Look, I mean, this always happens too.
[00:25:38.958 --> 00:25:43.698]  When somebody comes over and basically attacks somebody, they'll go, oh, you guys stop fighting.
[00:25:44.078 --> 00:25:45.199]  I wasn't attacking him.
[00:25:45.239 --> 00:25:45.659]  No, you weren't.
[00:25:45.859 --> 00:25:49.459]  He continued to just go, oh, conspiracy theory is crazy.
[00:25:49.659 --> 00:25:51.140]  I'm like, well, here's the document.
[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:58.901]  And over and over you presented the documents, how they were doing the operative things beforehand.
[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:03.241]  You were talking about that, planes going into, you know, the buildings.
[00:26:03.722 --> 00:26:05.562]  He just didn't want to hear it.
[00:26:05.662 --> 00:26:11.285]  And you know, the same thing was done to Dave Von Kleist when he was on, and with his film, too.
[00:26:11.925 --> 00:26:15.186]  And they just don't want this stuff to get out.
[00:26:15.666 --> 00:26:27.471]  I'm glad you persevered, and you did an excellent job, but I'll tell you what, no matter how nice George Norrie is, he did have a problem in the first couple of hours with that guy.
[00:26:28.055 --> 00:26:30.137]  Now the rest of them, like you said, were reasonable.
[00:26:30.558 --> 00:26:32.600]  That Levine fellow was very nice.
[00:26:33.661 --> 00:26:38.185]  A lot of them don't have the knowledge you have, but at least they have some control.
[00:26:38.205 --> 00:26:40.948]  That guy was totally out of control.
[00:26:40.968 --> 00:26:48.236]  And if you go back on, I hope, because he said from time to time he was going to have you on, I hope he just gets you on and lets you
[00:26:48.857 --> 00:26:55.639]  Give the facts without competing with someone like that, that obviously was a government operative, in my opinion.
[00:26:55.919 --> 00:26:58.580]  Well, we don't know that, but I mean... What was his job?
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:26:59.800]  You said he had a job.
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:03.841]  Well, he was an ABC producer for Nightline.
[00:27:04.822 --> 00:27:09.783]  He is an award winner of Emmys, I think five of them.
[00:27:10.243 --> 00:27:15.004]  The guy was in all sorts of weird covert actions for the media in Vietnam.
[00:27:15.024 --> 00:27:16.045]  That's why I said co-op.
[00:27:18.747 --> 00:27:23.392]  He's got a scary resume, and then I didn't know who the guy was.
[00:27:23.612 --> 00:27:24.853]  I'd heard him once before on the radio.
[00:27:24.893 --> 00:27:29.078]  I didn't know, but I'm not going to say he's a fed, but, I mean, he was frothing.
[00:27:29.611 --> 00:27:34.055]  Well, he was frothing and he had absolutely no facts to dispute anything you said, Alex.
[00:27:34.515 --> 00:27:34.795]  Nothing.
[00:27:35.316 --> 00:27:41.781]  Well, I said that there was no way I could be beaten in a debate, not because I'm special, but because we have the facts, we have the truth.
[00:27:42.142 --> 00:27:44.003]  I said all that could happen was name-calling.
[00:27:44.043 --> 00:27:52.991]  The only thing is, when someone does what he does and talks over you, which he did in the beginning, and keeps at it and keeps tearing you apart...
[00:27:53.703 --> 00:27:57.945]  Then those facts are ignored, unfortunately, no matter how good they are.
[00:27:58.205 --> 00:27:59.526]  You did an excellent job.
[00:27:59.826 --> 00:28:01.187]  I hope you get back on this time.
[00:28:01.207 --> 00:28:06.409]  I hope you can request just to get on and present the material you have.
[00:28:06.429 --> 00:28:07.510]  Well, tell George that.
[00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:08.170]  Thanks for the call.
[00:28:09.131 --> 00:28:09.851]  I appreciate it.
[00:28:10.311 --> 00:28:12.933]  Let's talk to Mark in West Virginia.
[00:28:12.953 --> 00:28:13.653]  Mark, go ahead.
[00:28:13.853 --> 00:28:14.573]  Greetings, Alex.
[00:28:14.974 --> 00:28:16.354]  I did a great job last night.
[00:28:16.615 --> 00:28:18.776]  A long-time listener.
[00:28:18.936 --> 00:28:23.358]  I used to call in pretty frequently, but I decided to give other people a chance, so I haven't called for a year or so.
[00:28:24.085 --> 00:28:28.248]  I have a few quick points here I'd like to mention about 9-11.
[00:28:28.948 --> 00:28:33.291]  You blew a hole in the government story the size of Texas last night.
[00:28:33.512 --> 00:28:34.892]  You did a really good job on that.
[00:28:35.813 --> 00:28:44.479]  I was impressed that everybody on that panel seemed to agree that the government story about 9-11 is a total fabric of lies.
[00:28:45.368 --> 00:28:46.189]  That impressed me.
[00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:54.353]  I was also impressed that everyone seemed to agree that there were pre-positioned explosives in Building 7 of the World Trade Center.
[00:28:54.653 --> 00:28:56.454]  And did you hear how Lance dealt with that?
[00:28:56.474 --> 00:29:01.697]  He said, oh, I'm sure they just put them in there beforehand, you know, for national security or something.
[00:29:01.757 --> 00:29:02.397]  I mean, what?
[00:29:02.817 --> 00:29:11.222]  What do you think about all the federal employees going into work at sensitive locations around the country today, thinking about whether their building's already packed with explosives?
[00:29:12.489 --> 00:29:14.131]  You know, I was thinking that last night.
[00:29:14.391 --> 00:29:16.333]  I mean, there's no way to spin this.
[00:29:17.093 --> 00:29:23.639]  All I was doing was going off government documents, and then he would shoot his mouth off about how it wasn't true.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:24.860]  I'm going to get him on here.
[00:29:25.301 --> 00:29:25.461]  Yeah.
[00:29:25.801 --> 00:29:26.722]  One more thing, Alex.
[00:29:27.643 --> 00:29:37.152]  I'm wondering how many people consider that all four hijacked planes actually did have bombs on them the way the terrorists said they did.
[00:29:38.232 --> 00:29:45.717]  Because that would explain a lot about the Pennsylvania plane exploding in the air, the Pentagon plane disappearing.
[00:29:46.237 --> 00:29:48.639]  There's a lot we don't know, but thanks for the call, Mark.
[00:29:48.659 --> 00:29:49.419]  Good to hear from you.
[00:29:51.901 --> 00:29:52.881]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.302 --> 00:29:54.943]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.823 --> 00:29:58.525]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.293 --> 00:30:02.713]  We're good to go.
[00:30:25.265 --> 00:30:25.485]  I think.
[00:30:42.401 --> 00:30:42.801]  Death?
[00:30:42.922 --> 00:30:44.743]  Don't take unnecessary risks.
[00:30:44.963 --> 00:30:48.607]  Keep your arteries healthy and clear by taking Heart and Body Extract.
[00:30:48.647 --> 00:30:51.950]  To get Heart and Body Extract, go to heartandbodyextract.com or call 1-866-295-5305.
[00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:52.330]  That's 866-295-5305.
[00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:52.991]  Call now.
[00:31:01.184 --> 00:31:03.185]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[00:31:03.265 --> 00:31:13.970]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:18.872]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:18.932 --> 00:31:30.277]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:30.857 --> 00:31:37.725]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:31:38.105 --> 00:31:40.248]  Your purified water is now ready.
[00:31:40.748 --> 00:31:45.714]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[00:31:45.994 --> 00:31:56.565]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:31:56.805 --> 00:31:57.686]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:32:01.449 --> 00:32:03.130]  Soon the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[00:32:03.331 --> 00:32:05.352]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[00:32:05.552 --> 00:32:06.233]  Prepare yourself.
[00:32:06.393 --> 00:32:10.096]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.
[00:32:10.236 --> 00:32:15.980]  Call toll-free 888-211-1715 and receive the book The Bible Says for free.
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.441]  There is absolutely no obligation.
[00:32:17.601 --> 00:32:20.223]  No one will call you and your number will not be sold to telemarketers.
[00:32:20.343 --> 00:32:21.924]  We just want to make sure you know the truth.
[00:32:22.165 --> 00:32:25.007]  Get your free book The Bible Says by calling toll-free 888-211-1715.
[00:32:25.067 --> 00:32:25.787]  Again, that's 888-211-1715.
[00:32:31.371 --> 00:32:31.811]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.261]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:08.721 --> 00:33:11.562]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:12.702 --> 00:33:16.204]  We're here Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central.
[00:33:17.304 --> 00:33:20.765]  Back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:33:20.866 --> 00:33:22.586]  Blasting out on the AM and FM dial.
[00:33:23.226 --> 00:33:25.507]  Shambles casting on global shortwave during the day at 9.985.
[00:33:25.547 --> 00:33:26.828]  And what, the third hour 9.975?
[00:33:26.948 --> 00:33:27.508]  I forget.
[00:33:27.548 --> 00:33:27.908]  And at night at 3210.
[00:33:34.028 --> 00:33:41.173]  And of course, as I mentioned, on the web at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.net.
[00:33:42.074 --> 00:33:45.496]  We're about to go back to Brett and Randy.
[00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:47.471]  And is that Russell?
[00:33:47.511 --> 00:33:47.971]  I'm sorry.
[00:33:48.792 --> 00:33:51.955]  Brett, Ron, Rick, and many, many others that are patiently holding.
[00:33:51.975 --> 00:33:57.760]  When you hear one caller hang up, or when we're done with one caller, you're welcome to call in at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:09.951]  There's a lot of other news I want to get into, like the approval ratings plunging, some good news on illegal immigration, some bad news on the Bill of Rights and Constitution, just a bunch of other issues we will get to, but
[00:34:12.390 --> 00:34:20.094]  Obviously, folks, when we're talking about one of the most anticipated radio debates ever, just promoted for months and months by Coast to Coast AM.
[00:34:21.515 --> 00:34:26.998]  Bottom line, if you're tuning in for the first time, I never really had a chance last night to plug my video, Martial Law.
[00:34:28.099 --> 00:34:31.081]  About half the film is up on Infowars.com for free.
[00:34:31.921 --> 00:34:38.705]  You can go to PrisonPlanet.tv and get a monthly subscription, 15 cents a day, monthly and yearly subscriptions, 15 cents a day, folks.
[00:34:39.358 --> 00:34:51.001]  And get all 12 of my films, my book, Descent into Tyranny, Paul Watson's book, Order Out of Chaos, a bunch of other great documentary films that have been authorized to post, all of my weekly TV reports I do every week.
[00:34:51.061 --> 00:34:52.921]  By the way, the TV show is One Best of Austin.
[00:34:52.961 --> 00:34:54.102]  It's a pretty good TV show.
[00:34:55.122 --> 00:34:56.302]  Now you can get it nationwide.
[00:34:57.583 --> 00:35:00.603]  It's all there at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:35:00.703 --> 00:35:01.724]  Fifteen cents a day.
[00:35:01.744 --> 00:35:06.825]  That helps fund all our websites and the webmasters, the three webmasters I've got.
[00:35:08.248 --> 00:35:14.256]  Really four if you count my wife, but she doesn't get paid by all this.
[00:35:15.377 --> 00:35:22.626]  But prisonplanet.tv, or if you want to get a hard copy of Martial Law, a preeminent 9-11 film.
[00:35:25.313 --> 00:35:30.357]  It is my most powerful video, three hours long, a veritable mini-series.
[00:35:30.898 --> 00:35:33.019]  The toll-free number to call and order it is 1-888-253-3139.
[00:35:33.039 --> 00:35:33.500]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:37.163]  Or you can just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:57.732]  Or go to InfoWars.com.
[00:35:59.253 --> 00:36:01.035]  Link through to the SecureSafe shopping cart.
[00:36:02.016 --> 00:36:05.359]  Look at all the different specials we're offering.
[00:36:05.379 --> 00:36:06.920]  $18 off on three tape specials.
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:10.984]  In some cases, upwards of 75% off on my videos.
[00:36:12.526 --> 00:36:15.569]  Just check it out or call that number and ask about the specials.
[00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:18.031]  I just want to say this before we go back to calls.
[00:36:19.853 --> 00:36:20.553]  Day one on 9-11...
[00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:27.254]  You are a conspiracy theorist, nut, evil demon in league with Lucifer.
[00:36:29.456 --> 00:36:33.379]  Worse than the devil, if you said the government even had prior knowledge.
[00:36:33.439 --> 00:36:37.622]  Now everyone admits it, everyone knows it, the government won't even debate it, they admit it.
[00:36:38.503 --> 00:36:43.447]  So even people that disagree with me, who want to debate me, they have to admit the government had prior knowledge as to the game.
[00:36:43.908 --> 00:36:45.049]  We've already gone that far.
[00:36:46.009 --> 00:36:51.194]  And already my view and the evidence, the fact of government complicity, a criminal element of the government,
[00:36:51.764 --> 00:36:56.145]  The shadow government, which is now public, was involved in the attacks.
[00:36:56.225 --> 00:36:56.925]  Carried them out.
[00:36:57.666 --> 00:36:59.146]  There's no way to debate it.
[00:36:59.886 --> 00:37:01.147]  No way to get around it.
[00:37:01.727 --> 00:37:02.987]  You can run, but you can't hide.
[00:37:03.827 --> 00:37:12.790]  So I think it's interesting that both the individuals who were there supposedly debating myself had to agree with about 80% of what I was saying.
[00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:16.111]  Alright, let's go back to the calls.
[00:37:16.251 --> 00:37:17.331]  Brett in Kansas.
[00:37:17.431 --> 00:37:18.151]  Brett, go ahead.
[00:37:18.832 --> 00:37:19.892]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:37:19.952 --> 00:37:20.272]  Good, sir.
[00:37:21.208 --> 00:37:25.873]  I was on your show a little, probably three weeks ago, talking about Lee Hamilton, my consultation with him.
[00:37:25.913 --> 00:37:26.994]  I sent you that DVD.
[00:37:27.034 --> 00:37:27.655]  I hope you got it.
[00:37:27.675 --> 00:37:33.881]  I hope you can put it on the Internet, because it'll give your listeners a... Is it marked Lee Hamilton?
[00:37:34.902 --> 00:37:35.763]  I think it is, yeah.
[00:37:35.983 --> 00:37:37.585]  Again, that's the chief whitewasher.
[00:37:37.965 --> 00:37:40.087]  I've got to look in the pile of stuff and see.
[00:37:41.268 --> 00:37:42.390]  I must have missed it in the mail.
[00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:43.731]  When did you send it?
[00:37:44.338 --> 00:37:45.339]  Probably a week and a half ago.
[00:37:45.459 --> 00:37:46.720]  Okay, then I'm sure it's in the stack.
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:47.580]  I haven't gotten to it yet.
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:48.060]  Thank you.
[00:37:48.541 --> 00:37:54.445]  And yes, you confronted Lord Hamilton when he came to your town, one of the 9-11 Whitewash Commission people?
[00:37:54.925 --> 00:37:58.167]  Yeah, I watched that video of him on C-SPAN and all the callers calling in.
[00:37:58.207 --> 00:38:05.792]  A lot of them asked the same questions I did, and the responses that he gave were textbook exactly the same in both instances.
[00:38:06.152 --> 00:38:10.956]  He compared Abraham Lincoln both times, the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.
[00:38:10.996 --> 00:38:13.097]  We're still arguing over that both times.
[00:38:13.952 --> 00:38:15.693]  He just said a lot of the same things.
[00:38:16.734 --> 00:38:18.575]  And I really hope you can get that up on the Internet.
[00:38:20.055 --> 00:38:26.219]  In the past they used Kennedy, but now because 92% of us know the truth, they don't use the Kennedy example.
[00:38:26.279 --> 00:38:29.420]  Oh, you're like those nuts that the government killed Kennedy.
[00:38:30.701 --> 00:38:30.861]  Yeah.
[00:38:32.059 --> 00:38:33.839]  Anyway, that's pretty much all I wanted to say.
[00:38:33.879 --> 00:38:34.940]  You did a great job last night.
[00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:39.100]  I listened to the whole thing, and you and David Ray Griffin definitely won the debate.
[00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:41.301]  Did you hear the special fifth hour?
[00:38:41.321 --> 00:38:42.341]  Yes, I did.
[00:38:42.581 --> 00:38:46.642]  When Lance wouldn't stop frothing, so Norrie just cut it off?
[00:38:47.302 --> 00:38:49.842]  Yeah.
[00:38:50.722 --> 00:38:52.363]  I don't know what that guy's problem was.
[00:38:52.483 --> 00:38:53.523]  I don't think he was a fed.
[00:38:53.583 --> 00:38:59.644]  I just think he's got his eyes closed a little bit, because he did mention how one of his friends died on the 78th floor, and
[00:39:01.389 --> 00:39:06.273]  He was clearly trying to pull on heartstrings there.
[00:39:06.834 --> 00:39:09.135]  Yeah, people are trying to call him a fed.
[00:39:09.236 --> 00:39:10.396]  I don't want to say that.
[00:39:11.177 --> 00:39:13.159]  But he's certainly the best friend they've got.
[00:39:13.179 --> 00:39:18.863]  Because they've got to have an apologist that admits most of what we already know is true.
[00:39:19.244 --> 00:39:24.208]  We understand the old line, none of it's true, the government knew nothing, they had nothing to gain.
[00:39:24.608 --> 00:39:25.449]  No one buys that.
[00:39:26.451 --> 00:39:26.891]  That's right.
[00:39:27.351 --> 00:39:41.477]  And, you know, Alex, I've got a lot of liberal friends here in the town I live in, and they're the first ones to make excuses for the government and make excuses for Bush how fascism can never happen in America and how the government could have never been involved in 9-11.
[00:39:41.917 --> 00:39:45.038]  And I think people just need to open their eyes, man.
[00:39:45.078 --> 00:39:45.358]  They do.
[00:39:45.398 --> 00:39:45.899]  Good job.
[00:39:46.199 --> 00:39:48.900]  Good job, and thanks for sending me your confrontation with Lord Hamilton.
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:54.402]  By the way, yesterday I never got to it.
[00:39:55.157 --> 00:39:58.838]  The New York Observer, very respected, real muckrakers.
[00:40:00.038 --> 00:40:10.801]  We know that Rupert Murdoch made power alliances with George Bush before the election, alliances with other leaders in the past to boost them.
[00:40:10.841 --> 00:40:15.763]  He made it a public alliance to help get Tony Blair into office, the big gun-grabbing socialist.
[00:40:15.803 --> 00:40:17.083]  But he's pro-war, so he's good.
[00:40:17.783 --> 00:40:20.084]  Now those two have been meeting secretly.
[00:40:21.181 --> 00:40:27.305]  And it looks like he may be coming out for Hillary, and suddenly Fox News will be telling you how wonderful she is.
[00:40:27.625 --> 00:40:28.286]  I'm not kidding.
[00:40:28.346 --> 00:40:29.086]  I'm not joking.
[00:40:29.947 --> 00:40:34.549]  And Barbara Bush is calling Bill Clinton her son now.
[00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:40.173]  It's not just that he vacations with him, what, eight times in the last year.
[00:40:40.193 --> 00:40:43.975]  It's not just that he's a surrogate member of the family, Boston Globe.
[00:40:43.995 --> 00:40:48.058]  Well, they've always been narcotics dealers together, going back to Mina.
[00:40:48.638 --> 00:40:49.979]  It's all staged, folks, okay?
[00:40:50.859 --> 00:40:52.180]  So just get that through your heads.
[00:40:53.021 --> 00:40:55.443]  Out there, the so-called liberals that just can't figure it out.
[00:40:55.663 --> 00:40:58.025]  And the so-called conservatives that think Bush is a conservative.
[00:40:59.306 --> 00:41:03.050]  Let's go to Russell in Florida.
[00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:03.590]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:41:04.071 --> 00:41:07.113]  It's just one big, happy, elite, evil family, isn't it, Alex?
[00:41:07.874 --> 00:41:10.056]  Yeah, I mean, he's my son, she says.
[00:41:10.076 --> 00:41:10.757]  Give me a break.
[00:41:11.197 --> 00:41:11.477]  I know.
[00:41:11.657 --> 00:41:12.218]  Disgusting.
[00:41:13.419 --> 00:41:16.081]  I want to thank you for an excellent job last night.
[00:41:16.121 --> 00:41:17.703]  I listened to the whole thing, and...
[00:41:19.848 --> 00:41:21.930]  I think you did a great job.
[00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:27.373]  You came out with a right uppercut to the jaw knockout with your first opening statement.
[00:41:27.393 --> 00:41:32.016]  I had to listen to Lance rattle for 45 minutes before I got to talk.
[00:41:32.936 --> 00:41:37.099]  Alex, you know, he was the best friend of the feds last night.
[00:41:38.459 --> 00:41:42.642]  When he admitted that there were charges put in that building after he couldn't disprove it,
[00:41:43.413 --> 00:41:47.555]  And then said it's standard operating procedure because of black ops and black ops budget.
[00:41:47.755 --> 00:41:51.717]  Did he not admit right then to foreknowledge and complicity and planning?
[00:41:52.517 --> 00:41:54.658]  I don't want to make it all about that guy.
[00:41:54.678 --> 00:41:56.439]  I'm going to try to get him on.
[00:41:56.519 --> 00:42:04.002]  He really did viciously savage me over and over again with charges that weren't true.
[00:42:05.183 --> 00:42:09.305]  The very things he was spewing clearly is what he was borderline guilty of.
[00:42:10.306 --> 00:42:10.806]  Absolutely.
[00:42:11.046 --> 00:42:13.247]  That was what I was referring to.
[00:42:13.767 --> 00:42:18.688]  He was calling you a conspiracy nut when in fact he was creating his own... He was calling me a slanderer.
[00:42:19.148 --> 00:42:19.989]  Yeah, a slanderer.
[00:42:20.169 --> 00:42:21.809]  And then I would say, what am I slandering?
[00:42:22.949 --> 00:42:25.890]  You notice how he launched the personal... He started the personal attack.
[00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:27.331]  It was pell-mell.
[00:42:27.451 --> 00:42:28.331]  It just didn't stop.
[00:42:28.951 --> 00:42:30.972]  And I finally said, look, I will not defend myself.
[00:42:31.032 --> 00:42:32.152]  I'm not going to be diverted by you.
[00:42:33.272 --> 00:42:36.273]  It was like having a pit bull grab my leg every five seconds.
[00:42:37.672 --> 00:42:38.693]  You did a great job.
[00:42:38.713 --> 00:42:46.180]  I like one other thing he said, that by blaming the shadow government, you're doing an injustice to this, because we're never going to get anything solved.
[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:47.982]  Well, he called it a conspiracy theory.
[00:42:48.022 --> 00:42:49.123]  There's no shadow government.
[00:42:49.143 --> 00:42:53.347]  Then I started reading Washington Post, Austin Chronicle articles, and then he really blew up.
[00:42:53.947 --> 00:42:59.372]  Well, what exactly did he think was going to be solved by blaming minions underneath for incompetence?
[00:42:59.813 --> 00:43:01.474]  How is that going to solve what happened on 9-11?
[00:43:04.128 --> 00:43:05.769]  Well, the spin was in overdrive.
[00:43:05.789 --> 00:43:14.076]  They'd play a clip of an informant admitting the FBI cooked the bomb for the First World Trade Center bombing and then say that that proves government idiocy.
[00:43:15.076 --> 00:43:15.557]  A what?
[00:43:15.797 --> 00:43:18.599]  Did you notice a diversion by both guests?
[00:43:18.659 --> 00:43:26.505]  I liked Levine, although I think they were trying to divert off of 9-11 back to that fundamental Arab terrorist, the ones that caused this.
[00:43:26.785 --> 00:43:28.767]  Well, I've got to say, I was impressed with Levine, though.
[00:43:29.327 --> 00:43:32.690]  I mean, he was a nice guy, and he agreed with a lot of stuff we said.
[00:43:33.317 --> 00:43:43.404]  Well, I'm the guy always being accused of frothing.
[00:43:43.504 --> 00:43:50.288]  I mean, this Lance guy was just wild.
[00:43:51.309 --> 00:43:51.809]  Yeah, he was.
[00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:54.411]  I have one quick question for you, Alex.
[00:43:55.212 --> 00:44:00.975]  Based on what we see with Bush's approval ratings and the fact that they seem to be losing now at every little turn...
[00:44:02.699 --> 00:44:09.865]  You, from your sources and from what you can see out there, do you see another potential big terrorist attack happening this summer?
[00:44:09.905 --> 00:44:12.246]  Yes, and then they'll say, see, we were right, shut up.
[00:44:13.127 --> 00:44:18.011]  And oh, you stood up against our Patriot Act and you didn't let us protect ourselves and you caused this.
[00:44:18.849 --> 00:44:26.674]  Look, sir, I don't know how long you've been listening, but I said on 9-11, I said this is sloppy, this is meant to come out by the European owners of America.
[00:44:26.694 --> 00:44:36.379]  They're going to try to use this show, and myself and others, to expose who was involved, but compartmentalize it to it was just Bush, and then use that to demonize America.
[00:44:36.419 --> 00:44:38.961]  No, that's why it is a group above our government.
[00:44:39.661 --> 00:44:42.203]  Do you see something happening this year?
[00:44:43.596 --> 00:44:44.137]  I don't like it.
[00:44:44.217 --> 00:44:47.458]  Look, there would have already been a terror attack, but we exposed who was behind it.
[00:44:47.578 --> 00:44:48.438]  You were effective.
[00:44:48.859 --> 00:44:49.519]  You listened.
[00:44:49.579 --> 00:44:51.099]  You knew how important this was.
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:52.920]  You guys are changing history.
[00:44:53.861 --> 00:44:58.302]  I don't know what's going to happen, but they're in a corner right now, and I said it was a catch-22.
[00:44:58.603 --> 00:45:02.604]  If we wouldn't have exposed them, they would have already carried out more terror and set up absolute dictatorship.
[00:45:02.884 --> 00:45:05.946]  If we do expose them, it's either-or.
[00:45:06.006 --> 00:45:06.686]  It goes either way.
[00:45:07.481 --> 00:45:12.564]  Then if we do expose them, they're in a worse position, but then they've got to carry out an attack to smokescreen that.
[00:45:12.684 --> 00:45:16.686]  Unless it's so obvious, then they'll go into paralysis.
[00:45:17.206 --> 00:45:22.929]  Well, what better way to create a massive diversionary attack and then say, see, you know, this is what we need to do.
[00:45:22.969 --> 00:45:24.250]  We need to be fighting this war.
[00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:28.192]  And we need, you know, thousands of Americans have been killed.
[00:45:28.212 --> 00:45:30.653]  Well, I mean, Dick Cheney's out saying this is going to happen.
[00:45:30.673 --> 00:45:32.414]  They're all out there saying, attention to call.
[00:45:32.494 --> 00:45:35.636]  I mean, no, it's, look, this is for all the marbles, folks.
[00:45:37.003 --> 00:45:38.343]  I mean, I said it last night.
[00:45:38.403 --> 00:45:40.084]  I've looked into getting my family out of the country.
[00:45:40.964 --> 00:45:41.725]  I'm not going to leave.
[00:45:42.605 --> 00:45:44.385]  My family probably won't, because there's nowhere to run.
[00:45:44.405 --> 00:45:45.206]  It's a new world order.
[00:45:45.266 --> 00:45:47.666]  But, you know, my children can't do anything to fight the new world order.
[00:45:49.007 --> 00:45:51.988]  And, you know, I'll stay here in Nazi Germany if things keep getting worse.
[00:45:52.048 --> 00:45:54.629]  But, uh... I don't know.
[00:45:55.309 --> 00:45:57.029]  It's just... Folks, this is real.
[00:45:57.069 --> 00:45:57.950]  This is not a joke.
[00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.850]  This is not a drill.
[00:45:58.890 --> 00:45:59.830]  This is not a game.
[00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:02.531]  You know, I look death in the mirror every day.
[00:46:03.872 --> 00:46:04.192]  Alright?
[00:46:04.892 --> 00:46:05.332]  And, uh...
[00:46:08.146 --> 00:46:08.947]  It's unspeakable.
[00:46:08.967 --> 00:46:11.369]  I can't believe this is happening.
[00:46:11.469 --> 00:46:14.391]  I can't believe that I'm in the middle of this, the forefront of this.
[00:46:14.892 --> 00:46:15.893]  I never imagined.
[00:46:15.913 --> 00:46:20.396]  This is the most bizarre development in my life and all our lives you could imagine.
[00:46:20.436 --> 00:46:22.438]  But it's fruitless stranger than fiction.
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:25.661]  I pray to God to heal this land.
[00:46:25.681 --> 00:46:33.768]  I pray to God to expose the truth and to protect this country because the good people that are left here
[00:46:35.198 --> 00:46:37.219]  I think people are seeking God's face.
[00:46:37.299 --> 00:46:40.600]  And I think some miraculous things are happening.
[00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:42.161]  Just praise God.
[00:46:44.062 --> 00:46:47.463]  God, folks, is such a comforter.
[00:46:48.323 --> 00:46:51.485]  For those that aren't religious and don't love Christ, I'm just sorry.
[00:46:51.505 --> 00:46:53.125]  You just don't know the comfort.
[00:46:54.346 --> 00:47:01.829]  In this very treacherous times we live in, on this tiny little ledge I'm on, and we're all on.
[00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:04.430]  Oh,
[00:47:05.236 --> 00:47:14.238]  My fortress, my comforter, my strength, my sword, my breastplate, the helmet, everything.
[00:47:16.458 --> 00:47:17.998]  To face this, it takes courage.
[00:47:18.058 --> 00:47:18.858]  I know it does.
[00:47:19.419 --> 00:47:23.759]  I want to thank all the stations that carry us and are brave and love freedom and love the truth.
[00:47:23.799 --> 00:47:25.280]  I want to thank all the sponsors.
[00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:26.520]  I want to thank all of you, the listeners.
[00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:31.161]  I want to thank the people at the GCN Radio Network for letting me tell the truth.
[00:47:31.901 --> 00:47:32.741]  I'm just blessed.
[00:47:32.821 --> 00:47:33.501]  You're blessed too.
[00:47:34.443 --> 00:47:35.343]  We're in this fight.
[00:47:36.024 --> 00:47:36.744]  We can win it.
[00:47:37.464 --> 00:47:39.945]  But we've got to chin up, move forward.
[00:47:41.305 --> 00:47:42.926]  Brett in Missouri.
[00:47:42.986 --> 00:47:43.746]  Go ahead, Brett.
[00:47:43.786 --> 00:47:44.386]  Another Brett.
[00:47:44.887 --> 00:47:45.427]  Morning, Alex.
[00:47:45.747 --> 00:47:48.368]  I'd like to commend you on your performance last night.
[00:47:48.408 --> 00:47:49.088]  I caught the whole thing.
[00:47:49.128 --> 00:47:49.668]  It was excellent.
[00:47:50.028 --> 00:47:52.049]  I'm going to try to burn through my comments really quick.
[00:47:52.589 --> 00:47:54.230]  I don't want to take up any more time than I have to.
[00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:56.551]  I'm going to give Norrie, overall, excellent.
[00:47:57.191 --> 00:48:00.332]  Mr. Ditto Head brags about how he does excellence in broadcasting.
[00:48:00.768 --> 00:48:05.312]  For the most part, Norrie is doing a great job, and I commend his courage for taking on... No, I mean, I've got to say it.
[00:48:05.512 --> 00:48:08.234]  I mean, there's a reason it's the second biggest radio show in the country.
[00:48:08.294 --> 00:48:12.058]  I don't agree with a lot of stuff on the show, but I think he was very fair last night.
[00:48:12.758 --> 00:48:13.959]  He did a really good job.
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:28.832]  And the second thing I wanted to point out is, overall, in spite of the opposition that you faced, I think it's a very powerful statement that everybody, like all the other callers have reiterated, everybody agreed that the story is a crock.
[00:48:29.594 --> 00:48:35.678]  And I think that's going to go a long way, and I think that's going to do good to encourage people to look into the story further.
[00:48:36.158 --> 00:48:44.984]  And the last thing I wanted to say was there was a caller on after you, after George cut everybody off, and it's a regular caller to your show.
[00:48:45.004 --> 00:48:46.805]  Yeah, it was John from Ohio.
[00:48:46.845 --> 00:48:48.786]  He should have been on the panel.
[00:48:49.086 --> 00:48:50.007]  Total precision.
[00:48:50.647 --> 00:48:52.448]  I recognized the voice, but I wasn't sure who it was.
[00:48:52.468 --> 00:48:57.772]  I also wanted to commend him because he brought up a good point, and I think it will be good for the people who might have been
[00:48:58.681 --> 00:49:09.025]  On the opposition side, on Lance's side, he brought up the point that an operation of this precision, and we're supposed to believe that it was run by a couple of guys in caves.
[00:49:09.045 --> 00:49:14.507]  I also pointed out something that I tried to get out of my mouth three times and was interrupted by Lance at every turn.
[00:49:15.285 --> 00:49:26.428]  Northwoods talks about putting CIA agents on planes to stage their deaths, have those planes land, and then have drones fly out and be shot down to be blamed on a foreign country.
[00:49:26.548 --> 00:49:28.088]  Yeah, he did an excellent job.
[00:49:28.188 --> 00:49:31.729]  I mean, Northwoods is incredible, folks.
[00:49:31.749 --> 00:49:33.910]  His knowledge of Northwoods was far beyond.
[00:49:34.170 --> 00:49:42.192]  I've only been in the movement for a couple of years, so my education is continuing every day and will be continuing until I go see the man upstairs.
[00:49:42.851 --> 00:49:43.791]  No, it was a coup de grace.
[00:49:43.811 --> 00:49:45.112]  It couldn't have been a better first caller.
[00:49:45.192 --> 00:49:45.812]  Thanks for the call.
[00:49:45.832 --> 00:49:47.232]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ron in New York.
[00:49:47.252 --> 00:49:47.612]  Go ahead, Ron.
[00:49:47.632 --> 00:49:47.972]  Hello, Alex.
[00:49:47.992 --> 00:49:48.172]  Hello.
[00:50:09.314 --> 00:50:13.898]  In today's New York Sun, there's a very interesting topic about the centralization.
[00:50:13.938 --> 00:50:18.121]  They want to make a federal database, a unified system, to centralize medical records.
[00:50:18.761 --> 00:50:28.868]  And ironically, the headline states that Bill Frist, of course, majority leader in the Senate, and Senator Clinton have teamed up and they're on this issue together.
[00:50:28.908 --> 00:50:29.869]  They're on the same page.
[00:50:30.675 --> 00:50:37.958]  What you're talking about is the left and the right-wing servants of the New World darkness are agreeing on something which will affect all Americans negatively.
[00:50:38.558 --> 00:50:48.402]  Now, the first question we really have to ask is, what is the compelling need as to why the federal government feels the need to impose a national medical database of unified systems?
[00:50:49.182 --> 00:50:52.083]  Now, they've put it under the auspices that... Could you hold me over?
[00:50:52.263 --> 00:50:52.863]  I hear the music.
[00:50:52.943 --> 00:50:53.884]  Yeah, of course I will.
[00:50:54.164 --> 00:50:54.464]  Okay.
[00:50:54.824 --> 00:50:55.504]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:55.524 --> 00:50:55.564]  800-259-9231.
[00:51:02.381 --> 00:51:09.763]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:51:10.043 --> 00:51:14.765]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:51:15.005 --> 00:51:20.647]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:51:20.947 --> 00:51:21.327]  We're good.
[00:51:48.168 --> 00:51:48.568]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:52:01.406 --> 00:52:05.289]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:52:05.529 --> 00:52:10.954]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:52:11.234 --> 00:52:21.602]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:52:21.762 --> 00:52:26.106]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:52:26.286 --> 00:52:34.634]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:52:34.914 --> 00:52:41.220]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:41.640]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:53:02.609 --> 00:53:04.230]  You've heard it over and over again.
[00:53:04.450 --> 00:53:06.911]  It's not if a catastrophic event will occur, but when.
[00:53:07.271 --> 00:53:10.913]  When are all of our resources, the things we take for granted, going to be pulled out from under us?
[00:53:11.233 --> 00:53:16.095]  When this happens, we're going to have to take care of ourselves and our loved ones with the only resources we already have.
[00:53:16.415 --> 00:53:17.115]  Don't wait for when.
[00:53:17.356 --> 00:53:18.476]  It's important to act now.
[00:53:18.756 --> 00:53:22.478]  And Ready Reserve Foods has everything you need as your survival supply headquarters.
[00:53:22.678 --> 00:53:24.739]  Call 877-817-9829 and start preparing today for you and your family.

[00:53:35.328 --> 00:53:37.651]  Joyce cooked up a meal for the office and it tasted delicious.
[00:53:37.951 --> 00:53:40.093]  Ready Reserve Foods has everything for survival.
[00:53:40.314 --> 00:53:45.119]  From kits to shortwave radios, storage containers to non-hybrid garden seeds, and so much more.
[00:53:45.279 --> 00:53:47.221]  Literally everything you need for survival.
[00:53:47.541 --> 00:53:48.142]  Don't wait for when.
[00:53:48.522 --> 00:53:48.922]  Act now.
[00:53:49.262 --> 00:53:50.343]  Call for your free catalog.

[00:53:51.023 --> 00:53:51.303]  That's 877-817-9829.
[00:53:51.323 --> 00:53:53.144]  It's better to be a year too early than a day too late.
[00:53:53.184 --> 00:53:55.345]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to Midnight.
[00:54:13.306 --> 00:54:17.349]  All the great guests, your wonderful calls, all the news and information, my analysis.
[00:54:18.209 --> 00:54:29.157]  By the way, when my rebroadcast ends at midnight central tonight, Coast to Coast AM will kick back off and it's going to be open phones tonight, your chance to respond to what you heard last night.
[00:54:29.217 --> 00:54:32.819]  I suggest you call in if you've got comments about 9-11.
[00:54:35.141 --> 00:54:36.822]  Let's go ahead and go back to Ron.
[00:54:36.882 --> 00:54:38.223]  We'll go to Rick, Steve, Nick.
[00:54:39.278 --> 00:54:43.161]  Wesley and many others, and there's a bunch of other news coming up the next hour.
[00:54:43.181 --> 00:54:45.823]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Ron.
[00:54:46.163 --> 00:54:53.369]  So as I was saying, so we now have Bill Frist and Hillary Clinton together on trying to create a national medical database.
[00:54:53.389 --> 00:55:03.717]  Well, they're together, all these grand databases, they're together on open borders, they're together on gun control, they're together, I mean, seven of the so-called nine conservative judges were really liberals.
[00:55:03.777 --> 00:55:05.338]  I love the way that they sell it, though.
[00:55:05.518 --> 00:55:08.961]  When they asked Hillary Clinton about the privacy issue in the Sun, the New York Sun,
[00:55:09.651 --> 00:55:19.023]  She said, oh, well, she has an abiding concern for privacy, and we'll need the same people who designed the military software to be in on that board to protect privacy.
[00:55:19.384 --> 00:55:24.991]  What about the observer meeting that she's meeting secretly routinely with Rupert Murdoch?
[00:55:25.351 --> 00:55:29.352]  Well, because they're trying to, I guess, prep Hillary to be your next president.
[00:55:29.412 --> 00:55:29.812]  That's why.
[00:55:29.852 --> 00:55:31.172]  She will be the next servant.
[00:55:31.372 --> 00:55:33.993]  She'll be the next minion to this new dark world order.
[00:55:34.153 --> 00:55:35.053]  It's very scary.
[00:55:35.073 --> 00:55:37.053]  They're having all these straw polls where she's ahead.
[00:55:37.073 --> 00:55:38.913]  She's actually wildly unpopular.
[00:55:39.254 --> 00:55:45.095]  I know, but they're trying to promote that impression so everybody will foolishly go out and think, well, I don't want to be one of the outsiders.
[00:55:45.595 --> 00:55:47.035]  That's the mass psychology.
[00:55:47.115 --> 00:55:48.615]  It's called a push poll.
[00:55:49.575 --> 00:55:52.636]  That's what they're doing, and they're doing that because... Wait, did you hear the debate last night?
[00:55:53.605 --> 00:55:54.766]  In part I did, yes.
[00:55:55.406 --> 00:56:01.228]  Unfortunately, because it runs in the wee hours in the New York market, I fell asleep at some point, but I did hear part of it, yes.
[00:56:02.149 --> 00:56:02.689]  What did you think?
[00:56:04.110 --> 00:56:15.915]  Well, they had one guy that was there whose basic job, I think, was to try and distort the picture, but he really didn't prevail because yourself and most of the other panelists really weren't on the same page as him.
[00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:18.230]  I'm only sorry about one thing.
[00:56:19.111 --> 00:56:26.913]  When they have these debates or they have these panels on George Nouri, that they don't get that shirt-off guy on Nouri with you and some of these other panelists.
[00:56:26.953 --> 00:56:29.854]  I don't think he's probably too frightened to appear on the same show with you.
[00:56:30.214 --> 00:56:33.835]  I told him I'd be happy to debate him, and yeah, I think he's sneaking about.
[00:56:33.855 --> 00:56:35.675]  I know he won't come on this broadcast.
[00:56:35.975 --> 00:56:38.056]  But I wish I would like to see that match-up.
[00:56:38.616 --> 00:56:47.658]  Look, Alex, getting back to what I was saying about this, are the American people so stupid that they now need Big Brother to provide them with a medical database?
[00:56:47.698 --> 00:56:56.981]  You can't go to your... Well, sir, sir, sir... Ron, you already know that for, what, four or five years, every medical prescription you get is instantly uploaded to the government.
[00:56:57.461 --> 00:57:10.113]  You know that all the... I mean, USA Today admits when you order a pizza from a major chain, they're getting 20% of fines and fees, and it goes through a Homeland Security database for just basic misdemeanor warrants.
[00:57:10.674 --> 00:57:12.856]  And let me tell you something... Folks, that's not a joke, by the way.
[00:57:12.896 --> 00:57:13.116]  Go ahead.
[00:57:13.316 --> 00:57:14.457]  No, it isn't a joke.
[00:57:14.497 --> 00:57:15.638]  And let me tell you something, Alex.
[00:57:15.698 --> 00:57:17.340]  As you know, I come out of law enforcement.
[00:57:17.981 --> 00:57:22.405]  I'm going to tell something to the American public listening to your broadcast, all right?
[00:57:23.453 --> 00:57:24.654]  We database things.
[00:57:24.874 --> 00:57:27.596]  We always hide under the smoke screen of trying to help you.
[00:57:28.137 --> 00:57:29.218]  It's not what we're out to do.
[00:57:30.018 --> 00:57:30.759]  It's not there to help.
[00:57:30.799 --> 00:57:31.800]  Thanks for the call, Ron.
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:32.861]  It's all about control.
[00:57:33.021 --> 00:57:33.981]  Rick in Nevada.
[00:57:34.001 --> 00:57:34.662]  Go ahead, Rick.
[00:57:35.943 --> 00:57:37.824]  Excellent job last night, Alex.
[00:57:38.885 --> 00:57:39.306]  Thank you.
[00:57:40.987 --> 00:57:50.995]  R. McClellan, the father of the White House Press Secretary, Scott McClellan, a year or two ago, probably more like two years ago, said,
[00:57:51.570 --> 00:57:56.353]  Flip something by the radar of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:57:57.033 --> 00:58:04.698]  Maybe it didn't flip past your personal radar, but he said, we got our JFK assassination bonuses.
[00:58:04.738 --> 00:58:10.241]  And he said it as though it were just matter of fact, and as though he weren't even cognizant of the evil that he was involved in.
[00:58:11.354 --> 00:58:21.660]  Well, no, we had McClellan on, LBJ's personal lawyer, we've had his mistress on, all of them, LBJ's mistress, and, you know, he, about how they killed Kennedy, I mean.
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:31.846]  And last, or this morning, Peter Lance also seemed not to be cognizant of the evil which he, can I hold over after?
[00:58:31.866 --> 00:58:33.687]  Yeah, I'll let you finish.
[00:58:34.047 --> 00:58:39.911]  We're only 70 seconds away when we hit this break from the second hour of worldwide transmission.
[00:58:41.601 --> 00:58:41.901]  Big Brother.
[00:58:41.921 --> 00:58:42.301]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.636 --> 00:59:03.538]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.298 --> 00:59:05.159]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.179 --> 00:59:09.541]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.041 --> 00:59:14.183]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:19.225 --> 00:59:21.146]  Boy, battle scarred.
[00:59:22.907 --> 00:59:23.987]  Totally exhausted.
[00:59:24.007 --> 00:59:27.089]  The wild horses couldn't drag me away.
[00:59:28.477 --> 00:59:33.360]  I had a nice 22-hour day yesterday.
[00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:37.542]  22-hour day yesterday.
[00:59:39.864 --> 00:59:45.707]  Showing my film, doing my own radio broadcast, and doing a special four-hour debate on Coast to Coast AM.
[00:59:47.748 --> 00:59:53.251]  And now, ladies and gentlemen, we're here in the second hour of this June 17th Friday edition.
[00:59:55.472 --> 00:59:56.433]  Wide open phones.
[00:59:57.225 --> 00:59:59.587]  Coming up, I want to get into Bush's plunging approval ratings.
[01:00:00.648 --> 01:00:02.129]  A bunch of new Halliburton corruption.
[01:00:02.149 --> 01:00:03.750]  More news on Camp X-Ray.
[01:00:05.872 --> 01:00:06.852]  It's all very important.
[01:00:06.873 --> 01:00:08.153]  Some good news on immigration.
[01:00:09.655 --> 01:00:11.156]  Some other regulatory news.
[01:00:11.216 --> 01:00:13.157]  Shutting down little private dairies.
[01:00:14.478 --> 01:00:15.399]  Just total control.
[01:00:15.459 --> 01:00:18.802]  But right now, let's go back to Rick.
[01:00:19.702 --> 01:00:21.043]  Rick is calling from Nevada.
[01:00:21.103 --> 01:00:26.828]  Rick, you were making a point at the end of the last hour about one of the people I was debating last night.
[01:00:27.329 --> 01:00:28.981]  It's about Peter Lance and to...
[01:00:30.064 --> 01:00:42.432]  To reiterate the premise of my call, I made the point that Barr McClellan, the father of Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary... LBJ's personal lawyer, who said he was in the meetings where LBJ says he killed Kennedy.
[01:00:42.613 --> 01:00:42.953]  Thank you.
[01:00:44.013 --> 01:00:59.644]  He spoke about the bonus paychecks that they received, the lawyers received, for the JFK assassination work that they engaged in, for helping, in fact, helping in the cover-up and in the assassination itself.
[01:01:00.445 --> 01:01:11.318]  And Peter Lance, it seems to me, has that same sort of inability to recognize the evil of which he is a part, or which he promotes.
[01:01:11.818 --> 01:01:19.828]  Saying that, as you pointed out to an earlier, Carla, that, oh yeah, standard procedure that they wire these black-off buildings.
[01:01:20.459 --> 01:01:31.365]  And, in fact, putting his stamp of approval on the very insanity of wiring a building in Manhattan to destroy your black ops.
[01:01:31.685 --> 01:01:33.486]  And then Building 7 being blown up.
[01:01:34.927 --> 01:01:37.608]  So now we just poo-poo Building 7 and go right past it.
[01:01:37.648 --> 01:01:39.109]  Okay, they blew it up, no big deal.
[01:01:39.329 --> 01:01:41.030]  Well, I don't want to say he's some evil fed.
[01:01:41.050 --> 01:01:42.551]  I don't want to say Barr McClellan is.
[01:01:42.571 --> 01:01:43.391]  I mean, he went public.
[01:01:45.072 --> 01:01:45.792]  I know this, though.
[01:01:45.872 --> 01:01:47.073]  Didn't he seem panicked?
[01:01:48.175 --> 01:01:49.656]  He did seem a little hysterical.
[01:01:50.016 --> 01:01:58.800]  And right out the chute, the guy became ad hominem and, in fact, lost the debate at that moment.
[01:02:00.479 --> 01:02:20.248]  And a final point I wanted to make before letting you go today was that I stick to my guns of my original assessment that Mike Levine is the guy that really presents the danger here because he is the front to co-opt the 9-11 movement for the New World Order.
[01:02:20.268 --> 01:02:21.389]  Scary stuff.
[01:02:21.629 --> 01:02:22.289]  Take care, Alex.
[01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:23.090]  All right.
[01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:24.470]  I appreciate the call.
[01:02:24.911 --> 01:02:29.533]  I don't know that, so I'm not going to say that, but certainly his argument was better.
[01:02:30.743 --> 01:02:36.426]  Let's keep going to the calls here.
[01:02:36.486 --> 01:02:37.346]  Steve in Colorado.
[01:02:37.366 --> 01:02:38.667]  Go ahead, Steve.
[01:02:38.707 --> 01:02:39.448]  Hey, Alex.
[01:02:39.468 --> 01:02:40.508]  Good job last night.
[01:02:40.548 --> 01:02:41.128]  Way to go.
[01:02:41.308 --> 01:02:41.629]  Thank you.
[01:02:41.989 --> 01:02:45.491]  That should be an honor, having the name or the title of Bulldog.
[01:02:45.511 --> 01:02:57.917]  So what I want to mention was, it seems to me like the government plays, and I'm sure this is kind of a standard procedure for them, they play on the public's ignorance.
[01:02:59.201 --> 01:03:06.843]  Like, when they talked about, you know, the WMD that was supposedly over in Iraq, and then after they didn't find it, they said, well, we don't know where it went.
[01:03:06.863 --> 01:03:20.867]  It's like, well, with all the satellite reconnaissance and all the... Sir, it's public that the NSA gave them the specific exact warnings of exactly what happened, because they were picking up the war game drill chatter.
[01:03:21.468 --> 01:03:24.768]  And then Bush tried to claim he never got that warning, and now it's all admitted they did.
[01:03:25.269 --> 01:03:26.529]  In specific memos.
[01:03:27.446 --> 01:03:27.806]  Go ahead.
[01:03:28.186 --> 01:03:35.010]  Okay, it seems to me like they've got so many assets that they're not telling us... Well, they've told us a couple of them.
[01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:36.110]  Hey, do you have more to add?
[01:03:36.811 --> 01:03:39.292]  Yeah, could I hold... Steve, I don't want to just give you 60 seconds.
[01:03:39.312 --> 01:03:40.753]  I'll give you a minute or two more on the other side.
[01:03:40.773 --> 01:03:45.275]  And then Nick and Wesley and just many, many others.
[01:03:45.455 --> 01:03:46.395]  Rodney, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:46.415 --> 01:03:46.756]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:03:54.545 --> 01:03:57.427]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.667 --> 01:03:58.368]  Hello, my friends.
[01:03:58.468 --> 01:03:59.249]  Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.589 --> 01:04:04.272]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.613 --> 01:04:09.056]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:04:09.476 --> 01:04:13.659]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:14.480]  The Constitution...
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:21.445]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.665 --> 01:04:26.068]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.308 --> 01:04:33.534]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:33.774 --> 01:04:36.196]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[01:04:36.356 --> 01:04:38.097]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[01:04:53.985 --> 01:04:54.666]  Hello, folks.

[01:05:54.165 --> 01:06:01.049]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[01:06:01.589 --> 01:06:06.992]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Nonex Nail Gel.
[01:06:07.413 --> 01:06:17.418]  All-natural Nonex is a topical, ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[01:06:17.559 --> 01:06:19.960]  Nonex Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:23.322]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[01:06:23.442 --> 01:06:24.983]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[01:06:25.103 --> 01:06:32.568]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[01:06:32.848 --> 01:06:34.569]  It's also money-back guarantee.
[01:06:34.909 --> 01:06:46.597]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Long's, Brooks, and independent pharmacies nationwide, or online at drugstore.com.
[01:06:47.157 --> 01:06:51.521]  Non-X Nail Gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[01:06:58.045 --> 01:06:58.706]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.346 --> 01:07:00.407]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.128 --> 01:07:02.249]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.889 --> 01:07:03.730]  You want answers?
[01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:05.351]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.371 --> 01:07:09.974]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.195 --> 01:07:14.278]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:22.834 --> 01:07:25.578]  All right, we're now 8 minutes 30 seconds into the second hour.
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:30.164]  Any issue, any news item, anything you wish to discuss?
[01:07:30.184 --> 01:07:32.466]  The big 9-11 debate last night on Coast to Coast AM.
[01:07:33.559 --> 01:07:47.102]  Bush is plunging approval ratings as low as 25% approval of some of his policies, 39% of his handling of the economy, 39% of his handling of foreign policy, 37% approval for his handling of the war in Iraq.
[01:07:47.522 --> 01:07:53.863]  But again, Bush is meant to be hung out to dry for all the things that the corporate interests that own and control him are doing.
[01:07:55.263 --> 01:07:56.704]  Just like Bill Clinton or any of them.
[01:07:57.724 --> 01:08:02.425]  And it's so telling, the New York Observer article about Hillary secretly meeting with Rupert Murdoch
[01:08:03.436 --> 01:08:07.718]  This power alliance, as he did with Tony Blair, admittedly helping put him in office.
[01:08:08.959 --> 01:08:13.020]  Openly putting his newspapers and TV stations, Sky TV, behind him.
[01:08:15.121 --> 01:08:17.442]  Over in England.
[01:08:17.662 --> 01:08:31.489]  Barbara Bush coming out and saying openly, openly, this is incredible, that Bill Clinton is their son, their surrogate son now.
[01:08:31.549 --> 01:08:32.269]  He's our son.
[01:08:33.235 --> 01:08:34.536]  He's a member of the family.
[01:08:34.596 --> 01:08:35.696]  He vacations with us.
[01:08:37.377 --> 01:08:41.980]  And how the Republicans and Democrats vote together on all these horrible things destroying America.
[01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:48.783]  And these poor liberals who see Bush for what he is, the only part of what he is, they don't see the full horror.
[01:08:49.283 --> 01:08:51.644]  Just, oh, we should be with Bill Clinton.
[01:08:52.565 --> 01:08:54.026]  Oh, the evil Republicans.
[01:08:54.046 --> 01:08:55.406]  They're all owned by the same people.
[01:08:56.947 --> 01:08:59.348]  But we were talking to, who was the last caller?
[01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:00.129]  Stephen Colorado?
[01:09:00.829 --> 01:09:02.710]  We're going to go back to Stephen in a minute.
[01:09:03.297 --> 01:09:09.724]  But before we put him back on hold for a second, we've already taken about, I don't know, 12 calls or so in the first hour.
[01:09:09.764 --> 01:09:10.525]  That's pretty good.
[01:09:11.506 --> 01:09:13.609]  But I'm going into hyper warp, folks.
[01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:14.870]  And I always say I'm going to do this.
[01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:16.712]  I rarely am able to, but I'm doing it today.
[01:09:18.334 --> 01:09:21.518]  I want to take 20 calls in this hour and 20 in the third.
[01:09:22.719 --> 01:09:24.061]  So we're going fast.
[01:09:24.992 --> 01:09:29.933]  My point was that the government is not telling us, it seems to me like the government is not telling us the full truth, but they are
[01:09:50.546 --> 01:09:54.828]  Definitely playing on people's ignorance in order to sway public opinion.
[01:09:55.368 --> 01:10:00.250]  And another thing that you had mentioned was remote-controlled aircraft.
[01:10:01.851 --> 01:10:04.712]  That concept is definitely not new.
[01:10:05.252 --> 01:10:12.455]  There was a bomber aircraft in the military back in the late 50s, early 60s called the B-58.
[01:10:12.675 --> 01:10:19.598]  This aircraft was designed, by the way, it was built by Convair, which turned into General Dynamics, if I remember right.
[01:10:20.017 --> 01:10:24.541]  But it was designed to be computer controlled from wheels off the ground.
[01:10:24.581 --> 01:10:34.851]  In other words, after it took off, for a computer to fly it, the whole mission for it, until it came back to the base and then the pilots would take over on final.
[01:10:35.293 --> 01:10:38.554]  And again, that was way back in the late 50s and the early 60s.
[01:10:38.615 --> 01:10:44.457]  Sir, do you know how Joseph Kennedy's firstborn... JFK was not firstborn.
[01:10:44.897 --> 01:10:45.958]  Do you know how he died?
[01:10:46.418 --> 01:10:46.998]  Yes, yes.
[01:10:47.078 --> 01:10:58.503]  He was in an explosives-laden aircraft that they were trying to fly into a Japanese target, and then at the last minute, Joseph Jr.
[01:10:58.724 --> 01:11:01.885]  and I guess probably another guy would bail out.
[01:11:02.901 --> 01:11:04.261]  Yes, that's the way.
[01:11:04.321 --> 01:11:12.783]  And it was controlled by radio into the final part of the mission, into the target, after the pilots bailed out.
[01:11:13.103 --> 01:11:13.403]  Yes.
[01:11:14.484 --> 01:11:16.804]  So NORAB was set up in 1957.
[01:11:17.224 --> 01:11:23.866]  Since 1958, they have been piloting drone aircraft and shooting them down.
[01:11:23.886 --> 01:11:26.767]  I mean, everybody's seen the footage of a drone aircraft being shot down.
[01:11:26.787 --> 01:11:28.107]  Everybody knows what a cruise missile is.
[01:11:28.627 --> 01:11:29.907]  They've had, what, a 747 fly in the 80s.
[01:11:33.203 --> 01:11:37.445]  From, and they did it again in the 90s, from California to Australia.
[01:11:38.805 --> 01:11:40.906]  Take off, fly, and land.
[01:11:41.807 --> 01:11:44.388]  So it's old technology, and listen, thanks for the call.
[01:11:44.868 --> 01:11:46.789]  And so many people still say, oh, that's impossible.
[01:11:48.489 --> 01:11:49.870]  Okay, folks, whatever.
[01:11:51.090 --> 01:11:53.411]  Let's go ahead and talk to Nick in Canada.
[01:11:53.451 --> 01:11:54.032]  Nick, go ahead.
[01:11:54.472 --> 01:11:58.994]  Hey, Alex, sounds like I missed a heck of a show yesterday, but the reason I'm calling today is...
[01:11:59.844 --> 01:12:05.287]  You had an article on your website a little while ago about police forces and how many police officers are abusing steroids lately.
[01:12:06.288 --> 01:12:09.990]  I was wondering if you knew who the six-time Mr. Olympia is right now.
[01:12:10.010 --> 01:12:11.932]  The current Mr. Olympia.
[01:12:12.112 --> 01:12:12.852]  No, I don't know.
[01:12:13.072 --> 01:12:16.234]  None other than Ronnie Coleman, who is also Arlington police officer.
[01:12:16.574 --> 01:12:19.096]  Always many times on the cover of muscle magazines in his uniform.
[01:12:19.816 --> 01:12:20.077]  Always...
[01:12:21.357 --> 01:12:25.618]  I was in a hotel room watching The Strongest Man a few weeks ago late at night, and it showed some big black champion that is a cop from Canada.
[01:12:40.652 --> 01:12:47.354]  Speaking of Canada, and the guy looked like, literally, like he must be drinking gallons of testosterone.
[01:12:47.374 --> 01:12:47.694]  Go ahead.
[01:12:47.734 --> 01:12:47.934]  Yeah.
[01:12:48.234 --> 01:12:52.195]  Well, if steroids are illegal for everybody, you'd think they'd be illegal for police officers, too.
[01:12:52.615 --> 01:12:57.336]  But it brings me to my next point, which is for the Arnold Exposed you should look into.
[01:12:57.756 --> 01:12:59.897]  Ben and Joe Weider, the Weider brothers.
[01:13:00.897 --> 01:13:05.638]  Arnold's often referred to them as his father, and they were responsible for bringing him to America.
[01:13:05.699 --> 01:13:07.439]  But there's some interesting facts about Ben Weider.
[01:13:08.638 --> 01:13:12.021]  First, he was, in 1987, awarded the Maltese Cross Order of St.
[01:13:12.061 --> 01:13:13.162]  John's Knights of Malta.
[01:13:13.182 --> 01:13:17.025]  1994, he was awarded the Torah Award by the Rabbinical College of Canada.
[01:13:17.745 --> 01:13:20.147]  1991, Distinguished Knights Cross of Austria.
[01:13:20.167 --> 01:13:23.910]  1998, he was an Honorary Chief Inspector for the Montreal Police Department.
[01:13:25.090 --> 01:13:26.451]  2000, Knights of National Order of Quebec.
[01:13:26.471 --> 01:13:27.392]  It goes on and on and on.
[01:13:27.452 --> 01:13:30.714]  It all can be seen at ISBB.com, which is their own website.
[01:13:31.415 --> 01:13:36.919]  But it just shows how the culture in bodybuilding has a big influence in the police force as well.
[01:13:38.587 --> 01:13:39.567]  You're absolutely right.
[01:13:39.647 --> 01:13:41.128]  I was aware of what you just brought up.
[01:13:41.148 --> 01:13:41.828]  Thank you for the call.
[01:13:42.869 --> 01:13:46.110]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:49.832]  Wesley in Tennessee.
[01:13:49.892 --> 01:13:50.652]  Go ahead, Wesley.
[01:13:51.392 --> 01:13:51.793]  Hi, Alex.
[01:13:52.393 --> 01:13:52.433]  Hi.
[01:13:53.153 --> 01:13:57.075]  I will try to make this short so I can help you get those calls in.
[01:13:57.675 --> 01:14:00.296]  Kudos for your performance last night.
[01:14:00.316 --> 01:14:01.837]  I thought you did a great job.
[01:14:03.117 --> 01:14:04.518]  One thing I can't tolerate are
[01:14:05.569 --> 01:14:06.830]  Evil litter patronizing.
[01:14:06.850 --> 01:14:11.434]  And I'm surprised that you were able to maintain your decorum.
[01:14:11.995 --> 01:14:13.737]  Operation North was the official U.S.
[01:14:13.757 --> 01:14:15.878]  government plan to carry out a 9-11 style attack.
[01:14:16.379 --> 01:14:17.960]  Ah, you're a demagogue.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.343]  You conspiracy making stuff up.
[01:14:20.363 --> 01:14:21.103]  I'm like, what?
[01:14:21.163 --> 01:14:22.004]  I mean, it was just, you know.
[01:14:23.065 --> 01:14:26.108]  Those are the cries of somebody that was
[01:14:26.570 --> 01:14:29.152]  You know, painted himself into a corner and didn't know how to get out.
[01:14:29.492 --> 01:14:35.797]  I'm 61 years old and I've got a lifelong friend who's spent 33 years with the Chicago Police Department.
[01:14:36.778 --> 01:14:39.400]  Pulled two tours as the Green Beret in Vietnam.
[01:14:39.780 --> 01:14:42.562]  He spent the last 15 years in Chicago.
[01:14:42.582 --> 01:14:45.684]  He has the second in command of the Bomb Squad.
[01:14:45.984 --> 01:14:53.330]  He broke open the plot of a Chicago street gang that was trying to purchase Stinger missiles from Muammar Gaddafi.
[01:14:54.409 --> 01:14:55.149]  I remember that.
[01:14:55.530 --> 01:15:07.156]  Every year he would spend four weeks training cops and military both, and munitions and explosives in Redstone Military Base.
[01:15:07.456 --> 01:15:07.916]  Arsenal.
[01:15:08.576 --> 01:15:09.197]  Arsenal, right.
[01:15:09.357 --> 01:15:17.761]  And he said there was absolutely no doubt that the two towers and building number seven were controlled takedowns.
[01:15:18.930 --> 01:15:25.413]  I'm friends with a bomb squad commander for a major metropolitan city in Texas, and he says everybody knows.
[01:15:25.533 --> 01:15:26.634]  I mean, day one they knew.
[01:15:27.955 --> 01:15:45.483]  He had a chance to see some photographs of the rotor that was inside the wreckage in the Pentagon and identified it as the rotor from a cruise missile.
[01:15:46.849 --> 01:15:47.109]  All right.
[01:15:47.129 --> 01:15:48.411]  Well, thank you for the call, Wesley.
[01:15:49.252 --> 01:15:50.873]  Let's talk to Rodney and Tejas.
[01:15:50.953 --> 01:15:52.055]  Rodney, go ahead, sir.
[01:15:52.375 --> 01:15:52.916]  Hey, Alex.
[01:15:52.996 --> 01:15:53.716]  How you doing?
[01:15:53.796 --> 01:15:54.677]  Good.
[01:15:54.697 --> 01:15:56.239]  Man, wonderful show last night.
[01:15:56.680 --> 01:16:00.684]  Must have drank a pot and a half of coffee trying to make sure I stayed up for that.
[01:16:00.924 --> 01:16:01.805]  I'm not going to lie.
[01:16:01.865 --> 01:16:02.906]  I drank a lot of coffee, too.
[01:16:02.926 --> 01:16:03.587]  I probably hung up.
[01:16:03.767 --> 01:16:05.289]  You know, you can get coffee hangovers.
[01:16:06.045 --> 01:16:06.325]  Oh, yeah.
[01:16:06.445 --> 01:16:16.148]  I normally drink one cup of coffee in the morning and about working like an 18-hour day and totally exhausted, I'll gulp another, which I always pay for, but I probably had five, six cups yesterday, and, boy, I don't feel good.
[01:16:16.508 --> 01:16:23.770]  Well, I was wondering, you know, after 22 hours, how were you going to, you know, respond during that show?
[01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:26.310]  And, man, you were magnificent.
[01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:28.791]  I have to give it to you, you know.
[01:16:29.711 --> 01:16:32.932]  And I also have to commend David Ray Griffith because, you know,
[01:16:33.513 --> 01:16:40.639]  He, in a very subtle way, kept saying, you know, look, George, I want to spend my time on evidence.
[01:16:41.239 --> 01:16:49.866]  And he was hinting that, you know, one of the other parties on the other side there, that they didn't want to do that.
[01:16:49.926 --> 01:16:53.148]  Oh, yeah, side issues, picking on the devil.
[01:16:53.669 --> 01:16:55.510]  Hold on just a second, Rodney.
[01:16:55.850 --> 01:17:00.574]  Before I forget, walking out of my other office, I told my producer, get me David Ray Griffin again.
[01:17:01.488 --> 01:17:01.869]  No, no, no.
[01:17:01.889 --> 01:17:02.549]  I appreciate that, but...
[01:17:19.895 --> 01:17:31.827]  You know, Peter spent most of his time trying to get you off the point, and David Ray Griffin recognized that, and of course you did, too, because you stayed on point.
[01:17:32.087 --> 01:17:38.054]  Well, I said when he first savaged me, I said, hey, I'm not even responding to this, I'm staying on the subject.
[01:17:38.674 --> 01:17:42.818]  Did you hear the nice compliment that he gave you, his first...
[01:17:44.191 --> 01:17:56.421]  Well, it was a put-down, but I kind of took it as a compliment in a backhanded way when he says, and Alex is the left version of Rush Limbaugh.
[01:17:58.757 --> 01:18:00.058]  Yeah, I'm real left-wing.
[01:18:00.118 --> 01:18:01.679]  I'm for zero gun control.
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:03.321]  I'm against abortion.
[01:18:03.361 --> 01:18:05.062]  I want to control our borders.
[01:18:05.122 --> 01:18:06.483]  I want out of the United Nations.
[01:18:06.983 --> 01:18:07.844]  Yeah, I'm real liberal.
[01:18:08.124 --> 01:18:19.031]  Okay, now finally, regarding Michael Levine, most of everything Michael was talking about, your listeners have already heard you talk about that.
[01:18:19.071 --> 01:18:22.494]  Now, he's bragged about how he's DEA, former DEA,
[01:18:23.405 --> 01:18:30.271]  Well, you have Sully Castile on your show, and he's basically told us all of that, and that's what I kept thinking.
[01:18:30.311 --> 01:18:40.419]  I said, I wish that you could get Sully Castile on your show to kind of give us an update on some of the things that Michael Levine was discussing last night.
[01:18:42.761 --> 01:18:45.743]  Well, Rodney, I hate to keep myself to my rule, but I'm going to let you go.
[01:18:45.763 --> 01:18:46.824]  I'd love to keep you on.
[01:18:46.884 --> 01:18:47.245]  Thank you.
[01:18:47.925 --> 01:18:48.406]  Take care.
[01:18:48.486 --> 01:18:50.547]  All right, we'll talk to Ann and others on the other side.
[01:18:50.587 --> 01:18:51.128]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.487 --> 01:18:58.891]  Did you know that you can trace every sickness, every disease, and every ailment ultimately to mineral deficiency?
[01:18:59.031 --> 01:19:07.338]  Did you also know that 99% of American people are deficient in minerals and a marked deficiency in any one of the more important elements actually results in disease?
[01:19:07.578 --> 01:19:09.199]  More than likely, this includes you.
[01:19:09.359 --> 01:19:12.462]  Arm yourself with the minerals you need from Mother Earth Minerals.
[01:19:12.742 --> 01:19:25.830]  Mother Earth Minerals specializes in providing the primary building blocks for nutritional supplementation, including liquid, water-soluble, elemental mineral suspensions, contain the essential nutrients required for the proper function of muscles, nerves, blood vessels, and organs.

[01:19:42.199 --> 01:19:42.920]  We're good to go.
[01:20:10.799 --> 01:20:11.560]  We're good to go.
[01:20:29.813 --> 01:20:31.894]  Currency, devaluation, inflation.
[01:20:31.914 --> 01:20:32.794]  One and the same.
[01:20:59.284 --> 01:21:03.608]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:21:03.629 --> 01:21:04.990]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:21:05.050 --> 01:21:05.751]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:21:05.791 --> 01:21:07.112]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:21:22.987 --> 01:21:23.267]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:23.287 --> 01:21:23.547]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:53.135 --> 01:21:55.496]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:21:55.756 --> 01:21:59.576]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[01:21:59.897 --> 01:22:00.717]  Read the labels.
[01:22:01.157 --> 01:22:05.258]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:22:05.498 --> 01:22:09.679]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:22:10.059 --> 01:22:14.920]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:18.904]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:22:19.084 --> 01:22:24.429]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:27.452]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:22:27.732 --> 01:22:28.633]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:22:54.235 --> 01:22:59.379]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:02.321]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:12.169 --> 01:23:15.570]  Continuing wide open telephones on this Open Line Friday.
[01:23:16.970 --> 01:23:18.711]  Ann in Michigan, you're on the air.
[01:23:18.771 --> 01:23:19.151]  Welcome.
[01:23:19.951 --> 01:23:20.731]  Hi, Alex.
[01:23:20.851 --> 01:23:24.412]  I listened to the entire program last night, and you were wonderful.
[01:23:24.432 --> 01:23:30.774]  I was really surprised you held your temper, because if I was sitting next to that guy at a table, I would have slugged him.
[01:23:33.155 --> 01:23:34.555]  No, he drove me crazy.
[01:23:34.735 --> 01:23:36.856]  None of his arguments made any sense.
[01:23:36.916 --> 01:23:41.657]  He kept saying that your focus was way too wide and you were confusing people.
[01:23:42.168 --> 01:23:46.091]  However, his was so narrow that he had nothing to say.
[01:23:46.831 --> 01:23:48.192]  And he kept pulling up stuff.
[01:23:48.232 --> 01:23:50.473]  Well, it's just always the government makes mistakes.
[01:23:50.553 --> 01:23:51.694]  They're a bunch of buffoons.
[01:23:52.034 --> 01:23:52.735]  Yeah, right.
[01:23:52.855 --> 01:23:54.396]  But I've got to tell you something.
[01:23:56.297 --> 01:23:58.839]  I'm really, really good at voices.
[01:23:59.099 --> 01:24:00.160]  I mean, really good.
[01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:02.081]  I drive my husband crazy with it.
[01:24:03.282 --> 01:24:05.203]  He was as nervous as a cat.
[01:24:07.048 --> 01:24:15.156]  He wasn't, you know, his laughter and, you know, every time he started to attack you, it was extremely jittery.
[01:24:15.937 --> 01:24:17.619]  I heard that.
[01:24:17.659 --> 01:24:19.341]  He sounded really flustered.
[01:24:19.741 --> 01:24:21.663]  He sounded panicked and afraid.
[01:24:21.703 --> 01:24:22.644]  How did my voice sound?
[01:24:23.225 --> 01:24:27.869]  You were totally confident and you were really trying to control yourself, you could tell.
[01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:30.332]  And you're an emotional guy.
[01:24:31.092 --> 01:24:35.817]  But you held it together extremely well considering the lack of sleep, too.
[01:24:36.398 --> 01:24:43.746]  But him, he reminded me of one of those cartoon cats who just stuck his paw into the electric socket.
[01:24:43.766 --> 01:24:46.549]  I mean, his voice was shaking.
[01:24:46.609 --> 01:24:49.092]  There was something wrong there, I'm telling you.
[01:24:49.292 --> 01:24:50.113]  There was something wrong.
[01:24:50.513 --> 01:24:51.154]  I don't know what.
[01:24:51.847 --> 01:24:52.647]  Something was wrong.
[01:24:53.087 --> 01:24:53.547]  I hear you.
[01:24:53.587 --> 01:24:54.328]  Thanks for the call.
[01:24:54.388 --> 01:24:55.548]  I appreciate that, Ann.
[01:24:56.028 --> 01:24:57.188]  Let's talk to Gary.
[01:24:57.208 --> 01:24:59.049]  Gary, where are you calling from?
[01:24:59.289 --> 01:25:00.629]  I'm calling from Austin, Alex.
[01:25:00.909 --> 01:25:01.489]  Welcome, sir.
[01:25:01.770 --> 01:25:03.110]  Hey, good job last night.
[01:25:03.190 --> 01:25:14.333]  My only complaint about George was... I don't know what your total talk time was, but I have a tape of that, and it seemed like you got shut out somewhat.
[01:25:14.993 --> 01:25:19.514]  Well, no, I had an atomic clock on my desk at my home office yesterday,
[01:25:20.329 --> 01:25:28.193]  And I don't have those notes in front of me, but Lance got twice the time I got in that first hour.
[01:25:28.813 --> 01:25:35.677]  And then I got three minutes and 14 seconds, and then Lance got another four minutes to attack me.
[01:25:36.277 --> 01:25:42.320]  But I think George, but then later, in one hour, I got more time than anybody else.
[01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:47.963]  The person that really didn't get enough time, because he's so gentlemanly, was David Ray Griffin.
[01:25:48.562 --> 01:25:48.782]  Right.
[01:25:49.022 --> 01:25:50.844]  But, you know, George did the best job he could.
[01:25:50.984 --> 01:25:51.544]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:25:51.644 --> 01:25:53.646]  I mean, I don't disagree.
[01:25:53.706 --> 01:26:04.894]  You know, I know that was a hard situation to try and manage, but one of the things about Lance was I really resent the fact that he kept attacking the messenger and dismissing the evidence.
[01:26:05.434 --> 01:26:06.415]  He wouldn't listen to you.
[01:26:06.435 --> 01:26:09.897]  Well, he said, I'm online, I'm watching a clip of Marshall Law, and you're in it.
[01:26:10.077 --> 01:26:11.238]  It's all about you.
[01:26:11.258 --> 01:26:12.039]  I know.
[01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:14.140]  What does that mean?
[01:26:14.761 --> 01:26:16.342]  I'm in New York interviewing people.
[01:26:17.225 --> 01:26:22.667]  He used that and those buzzwords, which makes me think he might be associated with the government.
[01:26:22.687 --> 01:26:29.830]  He kept harping on shadow government and that Bin Laden was not a CIA asset.
[01:26:29.930 --> 01:26:33.651]  And so I'd start reading Times of London and Associated Press and he'd blow his top.
[01:26:33.951 --> 01:26:34.411]  Correct.
[01:26:34.911 --> 01:26:39.213]  I mean, he had no facts, so all he could do is ridicule you and attack you personally.
[01:26:39.313 --> 01:26:41.834]  And that pretty much summed up his position as baseless.
[01:26:43.923 --> 01:26:45.403]  I know, it was something else.
[01:26:45.463 --> 01:26:46.204]  Anything else, Gary?
[01:26:46.604 --> 01:26:47.344]  One last thing.
[01:26:47.404 --> 01:26:52.786]  He kept trying to say you were undermining the truth by your fervor.
[01:26:53.306 --> 01:26:55.726]  Well, gosh darn it, we need fervor.
[01:26:56.246 --> 01:26:57.707]  But he had more fervor than I did.
[01:26:58.067 --> 01:26:59.887]  Well, yeah, but he didn't have the truth.
[01:26:59.988 --> 01:27:00.968]  He didn't have the facts.
[01:27:02.708 --> 01:27:04.109]  All right, thanks for the call, Gary.
[01:27:04.189 --> 01:27:06.349]  I don't want to make the show about Mr. Lance.
[01:27:07.510 --> 01:27:08.390]  It was a circus.
[01:27:08.490 --> 01:27:10.690]  I mean, look, you can hear the tape of it.
[01:27:10.971 --> 01:27:12.391]  You can go to Coast to Coast AM and
[01:27:13.169 --> 01:27:13.929]  Sign up with him.
[01:27:14.409 --> 01:27:17.910]  Same with us, like 15 cents a day, and you can hear those and download them however you want.
[01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:19.030]  I'd challenge you.
[01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:20.090]  I mean, go listen to it.
[01:27:20.110 --> 01:27:21.371]  He just attacked me over and over again.
[01:27:21.431 --> 01:27:22.271]  I'd sit there and take it.
[01:27:22.291 --> 01:27:24.091]  I would try to challenge him on facts.
[01:27:24.111 --> 01:27:25.212]  I wouldn't call him names.
[01:27:25.732 --> 01:27:27.372]  I'd go, okay, you said this isn't true.
[01:27:27.452 --> 01:27:28.532]  Here's the Washington Post.
[01:27:29.152 --> 01:27:31.113]  Okay, you said that this wasn't true.
[01:27:31.193 --> 01:27:34.353]  Here's Times of London, Buzzy Crongard, saying we don't want Bin Laden.
[01:27:34.774 --> 01:27:38.354]  Okay, you say that I would just... That's all I'd do.
[01:27:39.455 --> 01:27:41.635]  Okay, I got the clip of Silverstein saying they pulled it.
[01:27:42.712 --> 01:27:43.513]  They blew up the building.
[01:27:43.713 --> 01:27:44.554]  I mean, that's all I did.
[01:27:46.535 --> 01:27:48.076]  So this was not a fight.
[01:27:48.317 --> 01:27:49.317]  I was not fighting with him.
[01:27:49.478 --> 01:27:50.578]  This was one way, folks.
[01:27:50.619 --> 01:27:52.600]  I was being assaulted verbally.
[01:27:53.921 --> 01:27:56.843]  But that's a loser's argument.
[01:27:57.644 --> 01:27:58.645]  Let's talk to Keith.
[01:27:58.665 --> 01:28:00.526]  Keith, where are you calling from?
[01:28:01.087 --> 01:28:02.288]  Lake Elsinore, California.
[01:28:02.488 --> 01:28:03.028]  Welcome, sir.
[01:28:03.068 --> 01:28:04.670]  I'll probably have to hold you over, but go ahead and start.
[01:28:05.230 --> 01:28:05.670]  That's fine.
[01:28:06.411 --> 01:28:07.272]  I love you, man.
[01:28:07.472 --> 01:28:08.533]  I pray for your safety.
[01:28:08.553 --> 01:28:09.874]  I want to thank you for your courage.
[01:28:11.024 --> 01:28:14.505]  I want to ask your audience the question, the strategy on this war on terror.
[01:28:14.525 --> 01:28:20.008]  According to the art of war, which is required reading at West Point, the first thing you do in time of war is secure your border.
[01:28:20.708 --> 01:28:21.208]  What are we doing?
[01:28:22.048 --> 01:28:24.289]  Fighting a war on two fronts, wide open border.
[01:28:25.210 --> 01:28:28.131]  Propaganda seems to be pushing for a third war in Iran.
[01:28:28.271 --> 01:28:30.772]  And they're telling us terrorists are about to attack us any minute.
[01:28:30.932 --> 01:28:34.313]  Nuclear attack is imminent, but the border patrol is in order to stand out.
[01:28:34.373 --> 01:28:35.154]  Stay there, Keith.
[01:28:35.874 --> 01:28:40.076]  From California, then Tracy and Dave and everybody else.
[01:28:40.136 --> 01:28:40.476]  Stay with us.
[01:28:44.073 --> 01:28:45.073]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.453 --> 01:28:47.134]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.174 --> 01:28:50.795]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.716 --> 01:28:55.956]  I am a woman, and I care what I look like.
[01:28:56.697 --> 01:28:59.317]  Now when I look in the mirror, I don't like what I see.
[01:28:59.337 --> 01:29:02.498]  It seems that I have to fight to keep the weight off.
[01:29:03.138 --> 01:29:06.099]  When my husband looks at other women, it makes me crazy.
[01:29:06.119 --> 01:29:08.280]  I want him to look at me that way.
[01:29:08.300 --> 01:29:09.580]  Is it hopeless?
[01:29:10.140 --> 01:29:12.741]  Sometimes, I just feel like giving up.
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:18.066]  Judy Singer's Metasystem can help you lose the weight you want and increase energy.

[01:29:53.573 --> 01:29:55.174]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:29:55.314 --> 01:29:59.395]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:29:59.555 --> 01:30:02.436]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:02.516 --> 01:30:09.238]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract water-borne contaminants.
[01:30:09.418 --> 01:30:12.419]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:12.619 --> 01:30:15.020]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:15.140 --> 01:30:23.302]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aptinophenol,
[01:30:23.322 --> 01:30:24.923]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:54.300]  We're good to go.
[01:31:16.952 --> 01:31:17.513]  We're good to go.
[01:31:34.005 --> 01:31:34.405]  Death?
[01:31:34.526 --> 01:31:36.347]  Don't take unnecessary risks.
[01:31:36.567 --> 01:31:40.211]  Keep your arteries healthy and clear by taking Heart and Body Extract.
[01:31:40.251 --> 01:31:43.554]  To get Heart and Body Extract, go to heartandbodyextract.com or call 1-866-295-5305.
[01:31:43.574 --> 01:31:44.054]  That's 866-295-5305.
[01:31:44.094 --> 01:31:44.595]  Call now.
[01:32:02.772 --> 01:32:21.862]  The instant message just came in that my producer has got David Ray Griffin for the third hour on Monday, but we have the MI5 whistleblower on government-sponsored terror in England coming on in the second hour, and I probably want to keep him over an hour.
[01:32:21.882 --> 01:32:28.526]  So I'm trying to get a hold of my producer right now to see if we can twist Griffin's arm into coming on in the third hour today.
[01:32:30.106 --> 01:32:31.686]  That's in about 26 minutes.
[01:32:31.986 --> 01:32:34.307]  That probably won't happen, but we'll see.
[01:32:35.127 --> 01:32:36.868]  And we'll just continue with your calls in the news.
[01:32:37.348 --> 01:32:49.070]  We were talking to Keith in California, and I brought up this point twice last night, Keith, that they're saying imminent attack, we're going to be nuked, it's going to happen, but they're ordering the Border Patrol to stand down.
[01:32:49.730 --> 01:32:52.531]  And again, this threat is manufactured, folks, and they know that.
[01:32:53.602 --> 01:32:56.024]  Well, and that's the problem that we're facing, I think.
[01:32:56.044 --> 01:32:59.166]  We need to get the common person to understand this, and they don't.
[01:32:59.186 --> 01:33:02.188]  They watch Fox News and, you know, the managed mainstream media, and they put the little
[01:33:21.383 --> 01:33:25.604]  Stupid stickers on the back of their car, and they think they're supporting our troop.
[01:33:25.864 --> 01:33:27.544]  Well, here's what I've been doing.
[01:33:27.564 --> 01:33:28.685]  There's a reason why I called in.
[01:33:28.705 --> 01:33:34.746]  I want to ask your audience to join prisonplanet.tv.
[01:33:34.766 --> 01:33:35.926]  It doesn't cost very much.
[01:33:38.306 --> 01:33:40.427]  Download those videos.
[01:33:40.467 --> 01:33:41.127]  Don't stream them.
[01:33:41.227 --> 01:33:41.707]  Download them.
[01:33:41.907 --> 01:33:42.907]  Save them to your desktop.
[01:33:43.608 --> 01:33:45.588]  You can fit three of those movies on a disc.
[01:33:46.246 --> 01:33:47.326]  Burn one disc a day.
[01:33:47.586 --> 01:33:53.688]  You know, when you're at a gas station and you see somebody with one of those stupid propaganda stickers on the back of their car, pass them a tape.
[01:33:54.188 --> 01:33:55.169]  You know, or pass them a disc.
[01:33:56.209 --> 01:33:57.749]  You know, get the information out there.
[01:33:57.930 --> 01:34:00.330]  And how much does that disc cost?
[01:34:00.370 --> 01:34:01.251]  Like 30 cents?
[01:34:03.211 --> 01:34:07.873]  I'm putting out probably, I don't know, anywhere from 30 to 60 a month.
[01:34:08.413 --> 01:34:10.233]  You know, it's so insignificant.
[01:34:11.034 --> 01:34:12.474]  What's going to cost a lot is when
[01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:16.568]  They've got transponders in our cars and they're taxing us by the mile.
[01:34:16.748 --> 01:34:18.332]  That's going to cost some serious money.
[01:34:19.314 --> 01:34:21.159]  And we're just being herded into destruction.
[01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:22.682]  We've got to do something.
[01:34:22.923 --> 01:34:23.224]  Thank you.
[01:34:23.925 --> 01:34:24.486]  Well, thank you.
[01:34:24.546 --> 01:34:29.710]  Yeah, I mean, I was, again, like a space alien ten years ago saying they're going to put RFID in your cars.
[01:34:29.730 --> 01:34:31.111]  And they go, RFID what?
[01:34:31.151 --> 01:34:34.474]  Now it's all over the newspaper how great it is and how they're going to make you do it.
[01:34:34.514 --> 01:34:35.675]  They almost passed a bill.
[01:34:36.116 --> 01:34:45.283]  I mean, it came within a hair's breadth of passing in Texas that starting next year when you got your inspection sticker, they'd have the tracker chip for toll road taxation.
[01:34:45.323 --> 01:34:45.764]  It was in the bill.
[01:34:47.353 --> 01:34:52.476]  I mean, it passed the committee, and then the legislature ran out of time.
[01:34:52.877 --> 01:35:03.944]  They're going to have more special sessions now, and I guess these fool yuppies that laugh at me will believe it when it's in their car, and then they'll just go, I like paying $2,000 a year to drive.
[01:35:03.984 --> 01:35:05.385]  There's no money in the coffers.
[01:35:05.885 --> 01:35:08.527]  Well, here's the text documents saying they've got plenty of money.
[01:35:10.068 --> 01:35:11.989]  It's just mind-boggling sometimes.
[01:35:13.310 --> 01:35:14.571]  Oh, yeah, total control grid.
[01:35:14.591 --> 01:35:14.911]  I mean, it's...
[01:35:17.358 --> 01:35:19.860]  But listen, it really is an illusion.
[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:25.144]  There are a lot of people out there that believe the government loves them and everything's fine, but they are a minority.
[01:35:26.064 --> 01:35:30.247]  The majority knows the truth or inklings of it, but they're very cynical.
[01:35:32.128 --> 01:35:33.109]  They're very cynical.
[01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:34.470]  Ah, so what?
[01:35:34.490 --> 01:35:35.931]  I didn't even know about it.
[01:35:37.192 --> 01:35:38.453]  And that's the problem.
[01:35:39.834 --> 01:35:41.795]  Got to get those cynical people moving.
[01:35:43.737 --> 01:35:44.177]  Troy...
[01:35:45.436 --> 01:35:46.978]  In Florida, Troy, you're on the air.
[01:35:47.138 --> 01:35:48.699]  Thank you, Alex, for taking my call.
[01:35:49.060 --> 01:35:50.561]  This is my second time calling in.
[01:35:50.601 --> 01:35:58.649]  I talked to you a couple weeks ago, and we were talking about the Larry Silverstein video on PBS.
[01:35:59.010 --> 01:35:59.310]  Yes.
[01:35:59.730 --> 01:36:01.312]  You were telling me that it got pulled.
[01:36:01.933 --> 01:36:07.218]  So right after we talked, I went to the site, and sure enough, there's no listing of it anywhere.
[01:36:08.018 --> 01:36:26.563]  So I'm going to go to the library and get it and record it, but I think out of the whole 9-11 movement, Larry Silverstein admitting they pulled the building, that is like the biggest in-your-face nightmare that anybody can possibly come up with.
[01:36:27.643 --> 01:36:31.304]  Admit it on a special that they blew up the building.
[01:36:31.805 --> 01:36:33.065]  By the way, by the way,
[01:36:33.795 --> 01:36:36.116]  That show was in mid-2002.
[01:36:36.376 --> 01:36:37.377]  I have a copy of it.
[01:36:37.397 --> 01:36:38.617]  I have several copies of it.
[01:36:39.818 --> 01:36:43.059]  They always continually offer those PBS films.
[01:36:43.159 --> 01:36:45.921]  They've got Kevin Spacey, the actor, voicing it, roasting it.
[01:36:46.521 --> 01:36:48.002]  They don't offer that anymore.
[01:36:48.422 --> 01:36:53.124]  When we first found out about the tape, it was on one small little website.
[01:36:53.184 --> 01:36:54.305]  We grabbed it, put it up.
[01:36:54.585 --> 01:36:55.745]  It made big news.
[01:36:56.326 --> 01:36:59.647]  We were pushing it over the edge, but folks out there noticed it.
[01:37:00.688 --> 01:37:01.568]  They did a good job.
[01:37:01.588 --> 01:37:03.449]  I forget exactly who did that, but the point is...
[01:37:04.493 --> 01:37:09.574]  Is that, you know, got a zenith of somebody else, and then we, you know, grew it and brought it to term.
[01:37:10.554 --> 01:37:17.195]  And before we went out and said he did this, we called his office over and over and over again.
[01:37:17.235 --> 01:37:18.276]  Hey, you said this.
[01:37:18.316 --> 01:37:19.376]  We're going to go on the air with this.
[01:37:19.696 --> 01:37:21.276]  Will you please come on the radio show?
[01:37:21.976 --> 01:37:24.757]  The secretary at Silverstein Properties will pass that on.
[01:37:25.217 --> 01:37:26.137]  I started announcing it.
[01:37:26.857 --> 01:37:31.458]  And then, you know, two years later, Jimmy Walters of Walters Homes said,
[01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:35.003]  Runs millions of dollars of ads in New York.
[01:37:35.743 --> 01:37:38.085]  Larry Silverstein, they pulled seven.
[01:37:38.105 --> 01:37:39.567]  Larry Silverstein, answer the question.
[01:37:40.167 --> 01:37:41.649]  Imagine, he lives in New York.
[01:37:41.669 --> 01:37:46.193]  Do you have any idea how much 2.5 million, because it was 2.5 million in New York alone.
[01:37:47.113 --> 01:37:49.095]  It was a million and a half, now he spent another million.
[01:37:49.115 --> 01:37:52.218]  Can you imagine 2.5 million in TV and print ads?
[01:37:52.838 --> 01:37:56.842]  I mean, like on all the TV stations, saying this and he just says nothing?
[01:37:57.555 --> 01:37:58.116]  Unbelievable.
[01:37:58.296 --> 01:38:00.418]  And we're going, hey, just tell us you didn't say it.
[01:38:00.438 --> 01:38:03.961]  You know, tell us you didn't... I mean, come on, folks!
[01:38:04.261 --> 01:38:05.523]  Well, Alex, another thing, too.
[01:38:05.743 --> 01:38:07.224]  Let's just say this is possible.
[01:38:07.284 --> 01:38:10.167]  You know, believe in the lie that fire destroyed the buildings.
[01:38:10.187 --> 01:38:14.932]  You have the pictures of the woman standing in the hole and the speed in which the tower spelt.
[01:38:15.112 --> 01:38:16.693]  Ten seconds apiece?
[01:38:16.893 --> 01:38:18.355]  You can't run down the block that fast.
[01:38:19.850 --> 01:38:22.352]  They fell almost the speed of a bowling ball.
[01:38:22.552 --> 01:38:24.133]  Let's just say they were right.
[01:38:24.853 --> 01:38:35.499]  You would think that if the fire did cause the explosion or, you know, the collapse, that the top part of the building would have fragmented and fell off, not the whole 80 floors below.
[01:38:35.799 --> 01:38:37.620]  They admit they blew up seven.
[01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:38.260]  Thanks for the call.
[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:39.921]  I mean, it's just not debatable.
[01:38:40.221 --> 01:38:42.242]  How many people have figured this out yet?
[01:38:44.096 --> 01:38:44.857]  Oh, that's amazing.
[01:38:45.457 --> 01:38:46.337]  Good points, Troy.
[01:38:46.357 --> 01:38:47.038]  Good to hear from you.
[01:38:47.738 --> 01:38:49.259]  Dave in Illinois.
[01:38:49.299 --> 01:38:50.420]  Dave, go ahead.
[01:38:51.340 --> 01:38:52.061]  How's it going, Alex?
[01:38:52.301 --> 01:38:52.541]  Good.
[01:38:54.222 --> 01:39:08.771]  Yeah, I heard this thing last night, and he was pretty pedantic, and, you know, he was kind of a control freak, you know, always demanding all the time and all that, but the thing about going after Jamie Gorelick, that'd be like giving a Hydra a haircut, basically.
[01:39:09.775 --> 01:39:10.616]  Hey, I like that.
[01:39:10.676 --> 01:39:12.417]  Giving a Hydra a bad haircut.
[01:39:12.457 --> 01:39:19.923]  Yeah, they're going to thump one Hydra in the nose, one little small tentacle puss ball hanging off a Hydra's under chin.
[01:39:19.943 --> 01:39:26.929]  Yeah, we're going to give the Hydra a shaving neck and cut off a zit on a Hydra's face.
[01:39:26.949 --> 01:39:27.869]  How do you like my analogy?
[01:39:28.650 --> 01:39:31.552]  And, yeah, just blaming some little nothing underling.
[01:39:33.253 --> 01:39:39.038]  I don't know that much about law, but I think a guy going to law school, wouldn't she just plead the fifth?
[01:39:40.822 --> 01:39:43.784]  Yeah, well, it was amazing.
[01:39:44.645 --> 01:39:47.947]  Yeah, then the thing about, well, they put the bombs in number seven.
[01:39:47.967 --> 01:39:48.448]  That was good.
[01:39:48.968 --> 01:39:58.995]  But about the radio-controlled airplanes, they just had a thing out Wednesday, a press release from a good old British aeronautics who gets all of our money.
[01:39:59.315 --> 01:40:01.097]  Well, not all of it, but a whole big chunk of it.
[01:40:01.817 --> 01:40:08.822]  And they're successfully testing a fully autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle.
[01:40:08.862 --> 01:40:09.823]  So, you know, it's...
[01:40:10.580 --> 01:40:13.762]  The whole radio control thing, that's so old.
[01:40:14.443 --> 01:40:15.704]  It's ridiculous.
[01:40:15.884 --> 01:40:16.464]  No, I hear you.
[01:40:16.484 --> 01:40:17.165]  Thank you for the call.
[01:40:17.185 --> 01:40:18.446]  Great points, Dave.
[01:40:19.146 --> 01:40:19.426]  Listen.
[01:40:21.147 --> 01:40:26.431]  Again, late 1950s, drones taking off, flying 1,000 miles, landing.
[01:40:26.992 --> 01:40:31.435]  By 2010, half of the Air Force will be unmanned.
[01:40:31.655 --> 01:40:33.056]  I mean, fighters, bombers...
[01:40:34.218 --> 01:40:39.142]  They're saying by 2020, everything but troop carriers will be unmanned.
[01:40:39.202 --> 01:40:48.890]  And that gives the globalists great centralization, and then people don't have to follow orders, and then they can pull off all kinds of scams, and then blame it on foreign enemies.
[01:40:50.791 --> 01:40:51.672]  But that's not all.
[01:40:52.112 --> 01:40:59.058]  Major publications have reported $67 billion.
[01:41:00.259 --> 01:41:01.640]  In fact, that quote is wrong.
[01:41:05.524 --> 01:41:05.824]  76 billion.
[01:41:07.625 --> 01:41:07.865]  Excuse me.
[01:41:07.885 --> 01:41:11.827]  If you want to check it, I know it's 76 billion.
[01:41:12.907 --> 01:41:15.508]  But I'm very tired, so my memory is not at 100%.
[01:41:15.708 --> 01:41:19.230]  But yes, it's over 60 billion.
[01:41:19.450 --> 01:41:20.470]  It's 76 billion.
[01:41:22.431 --> 01:41:24.071]  On ground robots.
[01:41:24.492 --> 01:41:27.293]  And that came out about four months ago in a bunch of big publications.
[01:41:27.313 --> 01:41:28.233]  I mean, they got the funding.
[01:41:29.312 --> 01:41:36.734]  In the next five years, by 2010, 70-plus billion dollars in ground combat mechs.
[01:41:37.655 --> 01:41:44.257]  And I'm not talking about Revenge of the Sith or Attack of the Clones, you know, those... with all those robot armies.
[01:41:44.697 --> 01:41:45.717]  Folks, this is real.
[01:41:46.938 --> 01:41:53.800]  I mean, I've got, you know, Honolulu advertiser newspapers that show, you know, one of these things, and it looks like there's hundreds of different types.
[01:41:53.820 --> 01:41:55.300]  Well, they've got a bunch of swords.
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:57.561]  They sent a hundred swords...
[01:41:58.816 --> 01:42:00.077]  I've been in Iraq for a year.
[01:42:00.938 --> 01:42:03.280]  These are little armored combat mechs that are remote controlled.
[01:42:03.300 --> 01:42:07.464]  But we're talking about AI, pre-programmed, with infrared.
[01:42:07.504 --> 01:42:11.307]  If you don't have a chip or if you're not wearing the ID bracelet that our troops wear, it kills you.
[01:42:13.048 --> 01:42:15.471]  So the Swords, again, are Model Ts.
[01:42:15.991 --> 01:42:19.734]  They've got these things that look basically like a Chevy Suburban with treads.
[01:42:21.095 --> 01:42:21.616]  Bristling.
[01:42:21.636 --> 01:42:22.557]  It looks like a cartoon.
[01:42:22.577 --> 01:42:24.098]  You know, like ten guns on the front.
[01:42:25.399 --> 01:42:30.504]  And they say it's for sound cannons, machine guns, rocket launchers, cannons.
[01:42:32.766 --> 01:42:38.771]  And in one demonstration, it shows a SWAT team, like ten guys, just opening fire with machine guns and grenade launchers.
[01:42:39.192 --> 01:42:44.056]  That's the photo in the front page of the advertiser, Honolulu advertiser.
[01:42:45.918 --> 01:42:48.140]  And they're just blasting it, and nothing's happening to it.
[01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:50.382]  So they got those...
[01:42:51.528 --> 01:42:55.550]  I mean, folks, 70-plus billion in ground mechs?
[01:42:56.290 --> 01:42:59.231]  Combat mechs?
[01:42:59.251 --> 01:43:00.472]  You know, it's 2005, folks.
[01:43:00.512 --> 01:43:00.892]  We're not in 1962.
[01:43:01.152 --> 01:43:03.413]  I mean, this is the future.
[01:43:03.893 --> 01:43:04.313]  We're here.
[01:43:04.673 --> 01:43:06.774]  It took a long time to get here.
[01:43:06.814 --> 01:43:07.194]  We're here.
[01:43:08.395 --> 01:43:09.695]  And they'll have control over that.
[01:43:11.576 --> 01:43:15.818]  And what you have is, again, they already have whole armies of these.
[01:43:16.613 --> 01:43:33.105]  Where a helicopter lands, five of these pop out the back, or they're dropped via parachute, and somebody in an office building in Langley, Virginia, is sitting there piloting them, looking through the cameras and the optics, or troops, you know, a thousand yards over the hill can do the same thing.
[01:43:33.606 --> 01:43:37.929]  But by 2010, autonomous, pre-programmed.
[01:43:40.050 --> 01:43:41.591]  Okay, they already have the prototypes.
[01:43:41.732 --> 01:43:42.212]  Just admit it.
[01:43:43.268 --> 01:43:45.030]  And that takes total control.
[01:43:45.710 --> 01:43:47.792]  When the soldiers won't follow the orders, it won't matter.
[01:43:49.013 --> 01:43:50.775]  Okay?
[01:43:50.835 --> 01:43:52.296]  This is very serious.
[01:43:52.916 --> 01:43:53.837]  Kevin in Boston.
[01:43:53.857 --> 01:43:54.518]  Kevin, go ahead.
[01:43:55.599 --> 01:43:55.979]  Hi, Alex.
[01:43:56.039 --> 01:43:57.180]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:43:58.261 --> 01:44:03.325]  You had talked about, you know, facing danger every day and how real this is.
[01:44:03.405 --> 01:44:04.046]  And, you know...
[01:44:04.733 --> 01:44:11.317]  I also subscribed to Sherm Skolnick's Cloak and Dagger site, which has been down for me, and I don't know if it's been down for anyone else.
[01:44:11.377 --> 01:44:12.378]  I gave him a call.
[01:44:12.638 --> 01:44:14.599]  He's got his other site out there, which has a phone number.
[01:44:14.619 --> 01:44:17.341]  He's doing fine, and he hopes to have the site up soon, so he's okay.
[01:44:17.381 --> 01:44:18.742]  I know I feel the same way.
[01:44:18.762 --> 01:44:21.424]  I've had your site go down on me before, and then it comes back up.
[01:44:22.264 --> 01:44:24.426]  A couple of the quick points.
[01:44:28.645 --> 01:44:33.449]  On the cutting edge, they had a game done by Steve Jackson, Inwo Games.
[01:44:33.769 --> 01:44:35.451]  It was the Illuminati New World Order game.
[01:44:35.531 --> 01:44:36.652]  He started planning this in 1990.
[01:44:36.752 --> 01:44:38.593]  Yeah, this was produced in Austin.
[01:44:41.189 --> 01:44:48.114]  And in the late 90s, they have the World Trade Centers being attacked, the Pentagon, and the Illuminati carries it out for martial law.
[01:44:48.534 --> 01:44:48.994]  That's right.
[01:44:49.014 --> 01:45:06.226]  And one thing, among all those game cards that predicted the things that have happened and some future things with the biological and quarantines and what we're talking about, but one of the things was the death face was predicted in the clouds of the towers going down, the demonic face.
[01:45:06.847 --> 01:45:08.328]  No, that's true.
[01:45:08.368 --> 01:45:08.868]  That's in there.
[01:45:09.246 --> 01:45:11.527]  Well, look, I appreciate your call, sir, but let me just comment on this.
[01:45:11.547 --> 01:45:13.088]  I don't get into things like that.
[01:45:13.108 --> 01:45:13.988]  You know, what do you mean?
[01:45:14.049 --> 01:45:17.290]  Well, I mean, I sneak into Bohemian Grove and I show that our world leaders do worship Moloch.
[01:45:17.310 --> 01:45:17.750]  I show the video.
[01:45:38.712 --> 01:45:41.353]  I don't get into cloud formations.
[01:45:42.453 --> 01:45:48.796]  I mean, I can put out a playing card if I'm an insider globalist, which, folks, is pretty obvious.
[01:45:48.956 --> 01:45:49.696]  I own this deck.
[01:45:50.256 --> 01:45:51.437]  I own this deck in the late 90s.
[01:45:52.517 --> 01:45:53.257]  Made here in Austin.
[01:45:53.938 --> 01:45:57.219]  By the way, Bush's internet service when he was governor was Illuminati internet.
[01:45:57.359 --> 01:45:58.259]  I'm not kidding.
[01:45:58.999 --> 01:46:00.520]  They just love flaunting it.
[01:46:01.747 --> 01:46:02.947]  I want to try to get that guy on.
[01:46:02.987 --> 01:46:04.068]  Maybe he's not an insider.
[01:46:04.088 --> 01:46:09.089]  Maybe somebody leaked it to him, like the Lone Gunman episode had the government remote controlling a jet into the towers.
[01:46:09.129 --> 01:46:09.809]  That was leaked to them.
[01:46:09.829 --> 01:46:11.009]  You know, we had Dean Haglund on.
[01:46:12.690 --> 01:46:16.511]  But, you know, he showed up at my house and spilt his guts last year.
[01:46:17.671 --> 01:46:18.891]  Maybe it was earlier this year.
[01:46:19.972 --> 01:46:23.473]  But, I don't know, I'm digressing.
[01:46:24.073 --> 01:46:28.574]  You can show a demon face in the cloud of the towers being hit in the same spots.
[01:46:29.864 --> 01:46:39.033]  And then later, you know, just freeze frame, you know, 45 minutes of a burn, or 30-something minutes of a burning building, and freeze it on a smoke formation that looks like a devil.
[01:46:39.053 --> 01:46:44.498]  I mean, you can walk up to any oak tree you want and see devils in it.
[01:46:45.699 --> 01:46:49.142]  You know, it's like those inkblots the psychiatrists have you.
[01:46:49.162 --> 01:46:50.884]  If you're looking for devils, you're going to see devils.
[01:46:52.786 --> 01:46:54.907]  If you're looking for Easter bunnies, you're going to see those.
[01:46:54.927 --> 01:46:56.848]  If you're looking for a Chinaman, you're going to see those.
[01:46:56.888 --> 01:46:59.990]  If you're looking for a sailboat, you're going to see those.
[01:47:00.050 --> 01:47:02.572]  I mean, my son points to the sky and goes, Look, giraffe!
[01:47:03.112 --> 01:47:04.152]  Look, hippopotamus!
[01:47:04.593 --> 01:47:07.634]  Look, Mickey Mouse!
[01:47:09.615 --> 01:47:18.060]  My son's never even been allowed to watch Mickey Mouse or cartoons of that nature, but he's seen the Mickey Mouse symbol signet.
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:19.680]  Oh, Mickey Mouse.
[01:47:19.700 --> 01:47:21.081]  We were having a barbecue last weekend.
[01:47:21.101 --> 01:47:25.783]  We were out there with Granddaddy, and he points and says, Mickey Mouse, look, tree, look.
[01:47:26.423 --> 01:47:27.524]  So, you know.
[01:47:29.165 --> 01:47:30.245]  Oh, man.
[01:47:30.265 --> 01:47:31.626]  I don't want to make you mad at me, Kevin.
[01:47:32.086 --> 01:47:34.687]  That was just my comment on the devil face.
[01:47:35.187 --> 01:47:36.548]  Charles in Louisiana.
[01:47:36.588 --> 01:47:37.408]  Charles, go ahead.
[01:47:37.428 --> 01:47:38.469]  How you doing, Mr. Jones?
[01:47:39.369 --> 01:47:40.570]  I am totally exhausted.
[01:47:40.890 --> 01:47:43.152]  It was a good debate last night.
[01:47:44.113 --> 01:47:46.895]  But only one thing, I went to sleep before the phone calls.
[01:47:47.155 --> 01:47:49.617]  You know, when you had the hour phone calls, I just couldn't make it.
[01:47:49.997 --> 01:47:52.499]  Every caller but one agreed with myself.
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:53.380]  Oh, man.
[01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:59.565]  Listen, the guy said, the guy that attacked you, he said he was watching your films at the time he was talking to you.
[01:47:59.585 --> 01:48:00.205]  Did he say that?
[01:48:00.546 --> 01:48:01.026]  Yes, he did.
[01:48:01.627 --> 01:48:04.448]  Yeah, see, he was some kind of opt to confuse things.
[01:48:04.468 --> 01:48:09.769]  But listen, I want to congratulate you and keep up the good work, Mr. Jones.
[01:48:10.369 --> 01:48:11.570]  We're going to win this thing.
[01:48:13.330 --> 01:48:15.290]  Well, I think we are, too, with God's help.
[01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:17.431]  I mean, evil always implodes of its own weight.
[01:48:17.471 --> 01:48:22.312]  I mean, I don't want to sit here and say that Mr. Lance is a fed.
[01:48:22.332 --> 01:48:23.012]  I don't know that.
[01:48:23.072 --> 01:48:26.513]  I mean, I think a fed may have been cooler.
[01:48:27.073 --> 01:48:29.114]  He was bouncing off the walls.
[01:48:30.207 --> 01:48:30.547]  Yes, sir.
[01:48:30.788 --> 01:48:38.313]  I want to tell the guy that's running off them DVDs, I've got a clone, you know, you can keep burning one off without burning it.
[01:48:39.613 --> 01:48:44.497]  It's a clone, and the DVDs cost about 40 cents apiece.
[01:48:44.717 --> 01:48:46.538]  I'll pay about 40 cents or something like that.
[01:48:46.978 --> 01:48:48.039]  What do you mean, a clone?
[01:48:48.419 --> 01:48:56.284]  In other words, you know, when you burn them, you've got to put the original tape in, make a copy, then you've got to take a blank tape and put another copy in to make one.
[01:48:56.905 --> 01:48:59.046]  But they've got a clone that you can make one copy...
[01:48:59.702 --> 01:49:04.305]  Of the DVD and just keep putting the tape in and it keeps popping out.
[01:49:05.366 --> 01:49:06.226]  Well, that's exciting.
[01:49:06.586 --> 01:49:11.009]  Yeah, well, Mr. James sent me that because I was making so many of your tapes.
[01:49:11.429 --> 01:49:17.853]  He sent me that because it costs a lot of money and he sent me that free to make the tapes.
[01:49:18.254 --> 01:49:19.654]  I never even met this fella.
[01:49:19.774 --> 01:49:21.736]  Well, whoever Mr. James is, good job.
[01:49:22.036 --> 01:49:25.398]  Yeah, and then he sent me the clone, but the clones, you can make a tape in about 23, 24 minutes.
[01:49:25.418 --> 01:49:25.738]  Well done.
[01:49:29.258 --> 01:49:29.618]  Yes, sir.
[01:49:29.758 --> 01:49:31.239]  Thank you for what you're doing, Mr. Jones.
[01:49:31.859 --> 01:49:32.400]  Thank you.
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:34.841]  Thank you, my friend.
[01:49:36.862 --> 01:49:38.722]  Wide open telephone calls.
[01:49:38.802 --> 01:49:40.223]  Everybody's calling and agreeing.
[01:49:40.343 --> 01:49:41.384]  We don't censor calls.
[01:49:41.404 --> 01:49:43.645]  We just ask your first name, where you're calling from.
[01:49:43.665 --> 01:49:44.385]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:49:44.445 --> 01:49:46.946]  If you disagree with me, you can hit me with your best shot.
[01:49:46.986 --> 01:49:48.247]  Stay with us.
[01:49:53.641 --> 01:49:55.162]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.443 --> 01:49:58.425]  The behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.565 --> 01:50:02.468]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.528 --> 01:50:06.732]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:50:07.092 --> 01:50:10.875]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:11.015 --> 01:50:12.797]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:21.044]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.224 --> 01:50:24.267]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.447 --> 01:50:27.309]  They are being led into the Sandpoint brig.
[01:50:27.790 --> 01:50:33.915]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.435 --> 01:50:38.218]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[01:50:38.639 --> 01:50:40.000]  Order your video today.
[01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:41.401]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[01:50:41.421 --> 01:50:43.703]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139.
[01:50:43.763 --> 01:50:45.004]  Or go to my website, Infowars.com.
[01:50:53.195 --> 01:50:53.495]  Thank you.
[01:51:14.065 --> 01:51:20.908]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:20.968 --> 01:51:23.288]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:51:54.153 --> 01:51:55.774]  You've heard it over and over again.
[01:51:55.995 --> 01:51:58.457]  It's not if a catastrophic event will occur, but when.
[01:51:58.817 --> 01:52:02.460]  When are all of our resources, the things we take for granted, going to be pulled out from under us?
[01:52:02.780 --> 01:52:07.624]  When this happens, we're going to have to take care of ourselves and our loved ones with the only resources we already have.
[01:52:07.964 --> 01:52:08.645]  Don't wait for when.
[01:52:08.905 --> 01:52:10.026]  It's important to act now.

[01:52:26.858 --> 01:52:29.179]  Joyce cooked up a meal for the office, and it tasted delicious.
[01:52:29.479 --> 01:52:36.644]  Ready Reserve Foods has everything for survival, from kits to shortwave radios, storage containers to non-hybrid garden seeds, and so much more.

[01:52:42.786 --> 01:52:44.766]  It's better to be a year too early than a day too late.
[01:52:44.786 --> 01:52:46.506]  Judges with wide open phones really focusing in on 9-11.
[01:52:46.526 --> 01:52:48.127]  We couldn't spend enough time on this.
[01:53:08.151 --> 01:53:14.454]  It's the foundational event of all the police state activities we see today, and the death knell of America, unless we turn it around.
[01:53:14.514 --> 01:53:21.176]  Just briefly, you want to get the preeminent 9-11 film that also exposes who the elite are and the police state.
[01:53:21.196 --> 01:53:32.161]  You need to get Martial Law 911, Rise of the Police State, $25.95, three hours plus long, and it's available through Infowars.com, as well as my other 11 films.
[01:53:33.544 --> 01:53:35.285]  Or by going to prisonplanet.tv.
[01:53:35.325 --> 01:53:38.225]  You can watch them all online right now, 15 cents a day.
[01:53:38.845 --> 01:53:39.846]  So many other features.

[01:53:43.507 --> 01:53:43.567]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:53:43.587 --> 01:53:44.707]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:53:57.072 --> 01:54:01.195]  Or, as I said, order via the safe, secure shopping cart at m4wars.com.
[01:54:01.576 --> 01:54:02.977]  Cut through all the hype, folks.
[01:54:03.217 --> 01:54:09.001]  The other 9-11 films out there, many of them are excellent, but I'm telling you, for effectiveness, we know what we're doing.
[01:54:09.061 --> 01:54:18.568]  We use a wide spectrum of documented data, and we put it together in a palatable format, and it's very effective at waking people up.
[01:54:18.588 --> 01:54:25.053]  So I know a lot of you have already woken up, probably more than I am, but it's important to get this film, and it also makes this broadcast possible.
[01:54:26.286 --> 01:54:27.107]  There is a bunch of news.
[01:54:27.567 --> 01:54:29.288]  The callers bring up a lot of different news items.
[01:54:29.348 --> 01:54:32.409]  A lot of news I intended to cover, but there is a bunch of news I haven't gotten to.
[01:54:32.449 --> 01:54:35.230]  We will cover in the next hour, but let's just continue with your calls.
[01:54:36.510 --> 01:54:38.231]  Let's talk to Kenneth in Rhode Island.
[01:54:38.291 --> 01:54:39.212]  Kenneth, you're on the air.
[01:54:39.872 --> 01:54:40.132]  Yes.
[01:54:40.912 --> 01:54:47.255]  I just wanted to mention to you that we're doing a great job in waking the country up.
[01:54:47.315 --> 01:54:49.456]  People need to hear this.
[01:54:49.516 --> 01:54:54.698]  I just wanted to mention, I'm a member of the people called the Nuavians.
[01:54:55.222 --> 01:54:56.283]  They're based out of Georgia.
[01:54:56.303 --> 01:54:59.044]  And we put out a lot of books on those subjects.
[01:54:59.625 --> 01:55:01.726]  Among the subjects that you're talking about.
[01:55:01.866 --> 01:55:05.688]  We call it the spell of sleep or ignorance that people need to wake up from.
[01:55:06.289 --> 01:55:10.291]  And what's going on with this World Trade Center bombing, what happened there.
[01:55:10.311 --> 01:55:16.375]  You know, I just wanted to mention that you're doing a good job in helping people break free from the spell of ignorance.
[01:55:16.835 --> 01:55:19.076]  From the spell of ignorance to the spell of sleep, they call it.
[01:55:20.197 --> 01:55:20.797]  What we call it.
[01:55:21.478 --> 01:55:23.139]  And I just wanted to take you up on the good work, man.
[01:55:23.737 --> 01:55:24.998]  Well, thank you for the call, sir.
[01:55:25.058 --> 01:55:25.718]  I appreciate it.
[01:55:25.758 --> 01:55:26.238]  Take care.
[01:55:27.058 --> 01:55:28.899]  Let's talk to Sean in California.
[01:55:28.939 --> 01:55:29.820]  Sean, go ahead.
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:30.600]  Hi, Alex.
[01:55:31.020 --> 01:55:37.223]  It was pretty clear from the debate that right from the outset, Mr. Lance was just looking for any little excuse to jump all over you.
[01:55:37.243 --> 01:55:50.008]  I mean, you brought up his investigation of the Oklahoma City bombing, where the Iraqis were involved, that Bush shipped in, Bush I. And then he jumped all over you and said, I never said that Iraqis were involved with the World Trade Center when you were talking about Oklahoma City.
[01:55:50.478 --> 01:55:53.999]  Then you mentioned the Gulf of Tonkin incident, and he said, of course that didn't happen.
[01:55:54.539 --> 01:56:00.241]  And like it was no big deal, like it was not connected to 9-11, you were trying to bring up the continuum of corruption.
[01:56:01.101 --> 01:56:03.522]  The continuum of corruption, yes.
[01:56:04.022 --> 01:56:10.504]  I mean, we can look at history as if all the events are isolated from each other, all occurring in a vacuum.
[01:56:12.325 --> 01:56:15.306]  Then he brings up World Trade Center 7, like, oh yeah, routine.
[01:56:24.812 --> 01:56:33.196]  Well, he just kept trying to get me to get into physical or personal confrontation with him, and I didn't do that, and I was not assaulting him verbally or calling him names.
[01:56:33.596 --> 01:56:34.036]  No, you weren't.
[01:56:34.356 --> 01:56:35.137]  You did a great job.
[01:56:36.697 --> 01:56:37.338]  I almost did.
[01:56:37.358 --> 01:56:38.738]  I wanted to call him punk.
[01:56:39.959 --> 01:56:40.179]  Well...
[01:56:40.785 --> 01:56:43.250]  I mean, he really sabotages our argument, I think.
[01:56:43.270 --> 01:56:46.997]  When he brought up World Trade Center 7, oh yeah, they routinely rig these buildings to explode?
[01:56:47.458 --> 01:56:49.923]  I mean, that is, I've never heard of that, but that might be true.
[01:56:50.203 --> 01:56:52.147]  But that just proves that the government did it.
[01:56:52.535 --> 01:56:56.237]  It doesn't prove that they, oh, well, they're just inept.
[01:56:56.277 --> 01:56:58.538]  They don't rig government buildings to explode.
[01:56:58.598 --> 01:56:59.318]  Give me a break.
[01:56:59.398 --> 01:57:03.840]  Yeah, well, I mean, and how much blowback are we going to accept before we see a pattern emerge?
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:07.822]  I mean, you've got a Brzezinski, and he said, oh, you have a conspiracy theory.
[01:57:07.842 --> 01:57:09.223]  Well, there you've got the blueprint.
[01:57:09.443 --> 01:57:17.087]  Brzezinski says we need to have helpful Pearl Harbor events to mobilize the American people for a war of global domination to invade Afghanistan, world government.
[01:57:17.367 --> 01:57:22.169]  Yeah, and he loves the Soviets, but he created the Mujahideen to fight the Soviets?
[01:57:22.799 --> 01:57:23.839]  When he praises Marxism?
[01:57:23.899 --> 01:57:25.920]  His books?
[01:57:25.940 --> 01:57:26.440]  Ridiculous.
[01:57:27.320 --> 01:57:28.160]  It's unbelievable.
[01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:30.341]  Third hour of transmission straight ahead.
[01:57:30.361 --> 01:57:37.603]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:37.923 --> 01:57:38.723]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:50.021 --> 01:57:50.683]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.345 --> 01:57:52.408]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.110 --> 01:57:54.173]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.858 --> 01:57:55.679]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.439 --> 01:57:57.960]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.020 --> 01:58:01.962]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.182 --> 01:58:06.324]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:13.228 --> 01:58:17.711]  Now, 30 seconds into this final hour.
[01:58:17.811 --> 01:58:19.051]  It is the 17th day of June, 2005.
[01:58:19.171 --> 01:58:20.032]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:58:26.031 --> 01:58:28.973]  I want to get into these earthquakes just briefly in California.
[01:58:29.213 --> 01:58:36.096]  I want to get into some good rulings by a federal court concerning illegal aliens and the companies that hire them.
[01:58:37.317 --> 01:58:41.159]  A racketeering suit going forward because they use it to depress wages.
[01:58:41.699 --> 01:58:42.620]  Organized crime.
[01:58:45.341 --> 01:58:47.082]  And several other key reports here.
[01:58:47.122 --> 01:58:48.042]  But we're continuing.
[01:58:48.523 --> 01:58:50.324]  I guess we're taking record numbers of calls here.
[01:58:50.364 --> 01:58:54.626]  We always have unlimited callers, but I normally only take about 15 calls a day.
[01:58:55.532 --> 01:58:58.193]  We're having open phones today, and I think we've already taken about 40 phone calls.
[01:58:58.213 --> 01:59:00.594]  Let's take another 20 in this hour and make it a total of 60.
[01:59:00.634 --> 01:59:01.654]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:59:01.674 --> 01:59:01.734]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:59:01.774 --> 01:59:03.275]  Talking about any issue you want to discuss.
[01:59:03.295 --> 01:59:04.676]  Up next here, I guess, would be Tim in Nebraska.
[01:59:04.696 --> 01:59:05.536]  You're on the air.
[01:59:05.556 --> 01:59:06.596]  Welcome.
[01:59:06.616 --> 01:59:06.756]  Hi, Alex.
[01:59:24.543 --> 01:59:28.085]  I got a little update on foreign troops training over here.
[01:59:28.105 --> 01:59:44.033]  If anybody's skeptical about it, I had talking to a customer yesterday from Torrington, Wyoming, and he told me he worked at Camp Guernsey, and I'd heard some callers from Wyoming on your show before.
[01:59:44.073 --> 01:59:46.014]  Yeah, anti-terrorism base there.
[01:59:46.354 --> 01:59:50.256]  Yeah, and I said, is it true they've got Russian troops training there?
[01:59:50.276 --> 01:59:53.418]  He goes, oh yeah, Russians, Poles, Aussies.
[01:59:54.557 --> 01:59:55.137]  Whole deal.
[01:59:56.257 --> 02:00:01.879]  I've been to these training drills that are in major cities, and they're openly trying to take our guns and put us in camps.
[02:00:03.639 --> 02:00:04.960]  Folks, I've made films on it.
[02:00:04.980 --> 02:00:06.280]  They admit it's for America.
[02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:09.641]  Of course, it has dual use for overseas, too.
[02:00:09.841 --> 02:00:11.401]  I've got another question for you.
[02:00:12.941 --> 02:00:22.084]  I've heard you talk about trying to get your movie into theaters and to stay away from the corporate-owned ones or whatever, the bigger ones.
[02:00:22.104 --> 02:00:23.404]  You've got a little...
[02:00:23.922 --> 02:00:25.963]  Well, you shouldn't have to pay them to play the film.
[02:00:25.983 --> 02:00:26.063]  What?
[02:00:26.083 --> 02:00:26.663]  I don't know.
[02:00:26.763 --> 02:00:27.124]  I can't.
[02:00:27.144 --> 02:00:28.464]  I mean, that's so detailed.
[02:00:28.484 --> 02:00:31.446]  I'm going to take 20 minutes to talk about how the theaters operate.
[02:00:47.757 --> 02:00:49.498]  I don't know, just approach him.
[02:00:49.658 --> 02:00:52.940]  I'll email you on tips and see if you could give me a... Okay.
[02:00:53.460 --> 02:00:55.041]  Okay, I'll do that.
[02:00:55.321 --> 02:00:56.861]  I've got to squeeze some sleep in, but I'll try.
[02:00:56.881 --> 02:00:57.602]  Thanks for the call.
[02:00:57.742 --> 02:00:58.942]  Appreciate it, sir.
[02:00:59.923 --> 02:01:02.924]  Let's go ahead and go to another caller here.
[02:01:02.944 --> 02:01:05.586]  Let's talk to Chris in Illinois.
[02:01:05.646 --> 02:01:06.926]  Chris in Illinois, you're on the air.
[02:01:07.126 --> 02:01:08.207]  Hi, I live...
[02:01:09.195 --> 02:01:19.078]  On the border, right on the Mississippi River, and I live about 500 yards from, I think, the country's biggest arsenal, but that's Rock Island County.
[02:01:19.799 --> 02:01:31.903]  And in Scott County, which is immediately across the river in Iowa, they just came, I just heard it on the news, they're trying to pass a law saying that if...
[02:01:33.188 --> 02:01:38.593]  There's some kind of like flu outbreak or whether it be SARS or West Nile virus.
[02:01:38.613 --> 02:01:41.016]  They'll shut things down and forcibly inject you.
[02:01:41.316 --> 02:01:44.459]  No, they'll forcibly make you stay home.
[02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:48.883]  Well, sir, that's why they want to have the biological release.
[02:01:48.983 --> 02:01:56.369]  It's in the model states of the Emergency Powers Act, and page 76 of the Homeland Security Legislation they passed three years ago, two and a half years ago.
[02:01:56.409 --> 02:01:59.872]  What they do is, this is the cover for total martial law.
[02:02:00.192 --> 02:02:00.393]  Yep.
[02:02:00.453 --> 02:02:03.215]  This is the cover for the government to totally take over the media.
[02:02:04.056 --> 02:02:05.217]  This is their cover, and...
[02:02:06.465 --> 02:02:09.986]  So, what, is the state or the county talking about this?
[02:02:10.006 --> 02:02:11.086]  The county is.
[02:02:11.106 --> 02:02:16.307]  Yeah, they couldn't get the states to do it, so the feds are basically federalizing the counties themselves.
[02:02:16.467 --> 02:02:16.967]  Oh, my goodness.
[02:02:16.987 --> 02:02:17.467]  All right.
[02:02:17.667 --> 02:02:17.947]  Thank you.
[02:02:18.627 --> 02:02:21.268]  Hey, is that not a wake-up call for you, Chris?
[02:02:21.408 --> 02:02:22.188]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:02:22.908 --> 02:02:23.628]  I knew this stuff.
[02:02:24.269 --> 02:02:25.569]  Thanks to you, I already knew.
[02:02:25.949 --> 02:02:27.429]  No, I know, but I mean, for all of us.
[02:02:27.489 --> 02:02:30.110]  I mean, it's not like we're talking about their plans, which are published.
[02:02:30.630 --> 02:02:31.430]  Now we're seeing...
[02:02:34.218 --> 02:02:38.089]  Step by step, building a cage for all of us, all of our children.
[02:02:39.312 --> 02:02:42.180]  We cannot put up with these murdering pieces of trash.
[02:02:46.483 --> 02:02:55.548]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[02:02:55.789 --> 02:03:07.035]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:03:07.355 --> 02:03:13.079]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[02:03:41.996 --> 02:03:48.821]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:03:49.061 --> 02:03:49.761]  Hello, my friends.
[02:03:49.861 --> 02:03:50.642]  Alex Jones here.
[02:03:51.002 --> 02:03:55.685]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:03:56.005 --> 02:04:00.408]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:04:00.848 --> 02:04:05.050]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:04:05.250 --> 02:04:08.112]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:04:08.192 --> 02:04:12.854]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:04:13.054 --> 02:04:17.456]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:04:17.696 --> 02:04:24.920]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:04:25.180 --> 02:04:27.581]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:04:27.761 --> 02:04:29.502]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:04:45.842 --> 02:04:49.604]  For a while now, you've been hearing about energized water and what it can do for your health.
[02:04:49.864 --> 02:04:53.325]  But have you taken the next step and actually experienced energized water?
[02:04:53.585 --> 02:04:58.427]  It's absolutely incredible what you'll experience while using the energized products from Aqua Northwest.
[02:04:58.727 --> 02:05:03.009]  You've seen the banner on GCNlive.com, but have you experienced the power of the pyramid?
[02:05:03.209 --> 02:05:06.351]  We all know that negative energy can make you sick at home or in the office.
[02:05:06.531 --> 02:05:10.752]  But the energy pyramid from Aqua Northwest wipes out that negative energy within a 125-foot diameter.
[02:05:12.313 --> 02:05:20.660]  After one hour, negative energy fields should be raised to a positive level, resulting in you and others in the area to feel wonderfully energized, among other possible health benefits.

[02:05:45.350 --> 02:05:50.391]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.731 --> 02:05:53.012]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:06:01.575 --> 02:06:03.316]  Dan, John, Leslie, Mike.
[02:06:05.396 --> 02:06:15.958]  We'll go to your calls here in just a few minutes, but I put the call out about 15, 20 minutes ago that if you disagree with me, as soon as you hear a caller hang up, you're welcome to call in.
[02:06:16.779 --> 02:06:18.939]  And you're welcome to disagree with anything we've discussed.
[02:06:20.119 --> 02:06:22.820]  And so, Michael in Kentucky...
[02:06:24.358 --> 02:06:32.843]  ...called in and disagrees, so I wanted to see if it was serious, because most of the time, I disagree, you're not doing enough to fight the New World Order.
[02:06:32.863 --> 02:06:33.984]  You know, it's worse than you say.
[02:06:34.004 --> 02:06:39.227]  You know, usually that's the kind of thing, or, no, I disagree with you, Alex, it's all the Jews, or it's all the Catholics.
[02:06:39.247 --> 02:06:48.512]  You know, I get those little things, but this is a real disagreement, and a fleck of it, because I talked to him during the break for about a minute, is a fleck of what he said to me is legitimate.
[02:06:48.532 --> 02:06:53.415]  The other part is not, and I can explain that to him, but go ahead, Mike.
[02:06:54.716 --> 02:07:18.156]  Well, let me preface by saying that it's hard to do a better job than the mainstream media, but I think because of the nature of the type of journalism that's being done in the alternative media, that you do have to do a much better job than they do as far as deciding their sources and getting their facts straight.
[02:07:18.755 --> 02:07:19.756]  Go ahead and get to it.
[02:07:19.876 --> 02:07:33.584]  Well, the United Press International floated the story out there, and Texas A&M, of course, has tried to correct that Professor Emeritus Morgan, what's his last name?
[02:07:34.724 --> 02:07:35.245]  Reynolds.
[02:07:35.725 --> 02:07:43.910]  Yeah, Morgan Reynolds does not have an office and has been retired for at least 10 years, so he doesn't have an office at Texas A&M.
[02:07:47.281 --> 02:07:49.902]  I've got the former CIA director's statement.
[02:07:50.943 --> 02:07:53.404]  They don't say anywhere in this statement that he was there 10 years ago.
[02:07:53.464 --> 02:07:54.725]  He was there a couple years ago.
[02:07:54.745 --> 02:07:55.585]  It wasn't 10 years ago.
[02:07:55.605 --> 02:07:57.526]  He's been retired at least 10 years.
[02:07:57.706 --> 02:07:59.788]  Let's just stop right there.
[02:08:00.128 --> 02:08:07.132]  Are you denying that a year and a half ago, or a year ago, that he was the chief economist...
[02:08:08.212 --> 02:08:10.533]  At a major department of the federal government.
[02:08:10.553 --> 02:08:13.494]  Yeah, but Secretary of Labor is the cabinet member.
[02:08:13.534 --> 02:08:14.534]  He's not a cabinet member.
[02:08:14.574 --> 02:08:23.676]  Sir, sir, I mean, first off, you're trying to, out of the gates, and pun intended, you're trying to say that he did something dishonest or bad.
[02:08:23.716 --> 02:08:28.357]  No, I'm saying the reporting was inaccurate in the headlines that said he was a cabinet member.
[02:08:28.637 --> 02:08:31.318]  He's a member of the Bush administration, just like...
[02:08:32.039 --> 02:08:38.057]  Okay, we're sorry for United Press International, and we're sorry for posting their... Look, just place her.
[02:08:38.732 --> 02:08:39.793]  It doesn't matter.
[02:08:39.833 --> 02:08:44.936]  We have the German Minister of Defense for the Reichstag.
[02:08:44.976 --> 02:08:47.677]  We have Bob Dole's former Chief of Staff.
[02:08:47.758 --> 02:08:50.799]  We have George Galloway, high-level member of Parliament.
[02:08:50.819 --> 02:08:53.281]  Michael Meacher, number three in the Blair Cabinet.
[02:08:53.761 --> 02:08:55.262]  All these people saying this.
[02:08:55.842 --> 02:08:57.744]  FBI agents coming out and saying this.
[02:08:57.964 --> 02:08:59.405]  You're like apples and oranges.
[02:08:59.465 --> 02:09:00.445]  Now, let me just stop you.
[02:09:00.525 --> 02:09:03.207]  Did you hear the first hour of Coast to Coast last night?
[02:09:03.607 --> 02:09:09.053]  No, I can't pick up AM where I'm at because my rural electric has so much noise.
[02:09:09.613 --> 02:09:10.094]  I understand.
[02:09:10.114 --> 02:09:12.276]  They're probably transmitting data down it.
[02:09:12.296 --> 02:09:13.657]  Let me just comment on this, please.
[02:09:14.018 --> 02:09:15.799]  Please, because you're a good guy and I want to comment on this.
[02:09:15.819 --> 02:09:17.081]  Well, yeah, I'm not against you.
[02:09:17.101 --> 02:09:18.882]  Michael, let me comment on this.
[02:09:19.723 --> 02:09:21.425]  You know where the disinfo came from?
[02:09:22.266 --> 02:09:24.728]  He talked about it on George Norrie's show.
[02:09:24.988 --> 02:09:25.329]  Okay.
[02:09:25.689 --> 02:09:27.411]  In the scramble to report on it,
[02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:40.409]  A big writer for American Free Press, I think he wrote it separately on his own website, though, put out an article where he said he interviewed Reynolds.
[02:09:40.489 --> 02:09:42.031]  Reynolds says he never talked to him.
[02:09:42.071 --> 02:09:52.019]  He took quotes from his Lou Rockwell article that Mr. Reynolds did write and put in the article that he was at Texas A&M.
[02:09:52.979 --> 02:09:53.340]  Then...
[02:09:54.514 --> 02:10:00.358]  Then UPI called, talked to some bureaucrat who got it wrong, and it was two years ago he was there, by the way.
[02:10:00.378 --> 02:10:01.899]  I don't know where he got this 10-year thing.
[02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:04.661]  He talks to them... From Lou Rockwell.
[02:10:04.681 --> 02:10:05.562]  Okay, fine.
[02:10:06.903 --> 02:10:09.404]  Then, well, I mean, I just interviewed Reynolds two days ago.
[02:10:09.484 --> 02:10:10.565]  I talked to Reynolds last night.
[02:10:10.585 --> 02:10:12.386]  I was on the air with... Okay, so on the same show as Reynolds.
[02:10:12.406 --> 02:10:13.607]  But let me just go back here.
[02:10:14.288 --> 02:10:18.951]  Okay, so this is the type of minutia that people get caught up in.
[02:10:19.071 --> 02:10:20.412]  Somebody on the Internet...
[02:10:21.093 --> 02:10:24.837]  Wrote an article, okay, saying he was at A&M.
[02:10:25.278 --> 02:10:29.042]  Then the media seizes on that and goes, oh, look, none of it's true.
[02:10:29.342 --> 02:10:30.643]  He was at A&M years ago.
[02:10:30.663 --> 02:10:36.129]  And then the very publication he publishes through comes out and corrects it.
[02:10:36.490 --> 02:10:38.452]  That doesn't discredit any of the debate.
[02:10:38.512 --> 02:10:43.057]  This is literally talking about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.
[02:10:43.297 --> 02:10:48.979]  Well, if it was the only time that I've seen it happen over the years, I wouldn't have any grounds to stand on it.
[02:10:49.019 --> 02:10:52.700]  You can go out into the whole alternative media and find where people make mistakes and stuff.
[02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:56.120]  Well, I'm not talking about the whole of the alternative media.
[02:10:56.280 --> 02:11:00.121]  I'm mainly talking about some... And I don't keep a notepad.
[02:11:00.161 --> 02:11:00.382]  I'm not...
[02:11:03.114 --> 02:11:05.736]  It's just a little constructive criticism.
[02:11:05.776 --> 02:11:17.085]  I'm asking you, was he, in the first Bush administration, the chief economist of the Department of Labor who advised directly, at the next highest level, directly in cabinet meetings?
[02:11:17.786 --> 02:11:20.588]  I don't think there was any record of him being to a cabinet meeting.
[02:11:20.668 --> 02:11:21.168]  Oh, yes.
[02:11:21.188 --> 02:11:21.609]  No, no.
[02:11:21.689 --> 02:11:25.051]  But the point is that some news articles out there say cabinet member.
[02:11:25.252 --> 02:11:27.093]  Again, you could dance on the head of a pen.
[02:11:27.393 --> 02:11:29.455]  Over time, those things get ironed out and corrected.
[02:11:29.755 --> 02:11:30.796]  Anything else, Michael?
[02:11:31.673 --> 02:11:38.997]  No, I just think he needs to be careful because it's really easy for people to criticize and say that's being exaggerated.
[02:11:40.338 --> 02:11:43.879]  Okay, so he wasn't in the high-level Bush administration?
[02:11:43.899 --> 02:11:44.740]  He wasn't the Chief of Congress?
[02:11:44.760 --> 02:11:45.821]  No, in high school civics.
[02:11:45.881 --> 02:11:47.281]  He's not in the cabinet.
[02:11:47.361 --> 02:11:50.963]  He's an undersecretary, which is what a lot of other governments would call him.
[02:11:51.103 --> 02:11:53.244]  So he was in high school civics?
[02:11:53.565 --> 02:11:55.746]  Who was the O'Neill guy that got killed on September 11th?
[02:11:56.961 --> 02:12:00.363]  He had been a Deputy FBI Director over terrorism.
[02:12:00.643 --> 02:12:01.983]  Yeah, he wasn't a cabinet member either.
[02:12:02.584 --> 02:12:03.744]  I never said he was a cabinet member.
[02:12:03.764 --> 02:12:05.985]  No, I know, but that's what I'm saying.
[02:12:06.325 --> 02:12:07.766]  Mike, thanks a lot.
[02:12:08.146 --> 02:12:08.746]  Thank you.
[02:12:08.786 --> 02:12:10.347]  Now, that was weird.
[02:12:11.588 --> 02:12:12.728]  As if someone said that.
[02:12:13.949 --> 02:12:19.951]  I mean, we just spent five minutes with you, and I'm totally confused by what you're saying.
[02:12:20.532 --> 02:12:25.354]  Some other website goes out and says he's a professor at A&M.
[02:12:26.553 --> 02:12:29.395]  Then we seize on that and start perseverating on it.
[02:12:30.195 --> 02:12:34.757]  And then Mr. Reynolds goes on air, puts out a release, and says, no, I never said this.
[02:12:34.797 --> 02:12:45.043]  His own article, the big ten-pager he wrote for Lou Rockwell, says when he was at A&M, emeritus, that means he's left A&M, still an honorary professor, it doesn't matter!
[02:12:47.584 --> 02:12:50.005]  In fact, quite frankly, what he's out saying doesn't even matter.
[02:12:50.025 --> 02:12:51.166]  We all know they blew Building 7.
[02:12:51.766 --> 02:12:52.787]  That's what we're talking about.
[02:12:53.320 --> 02:12:57.864]  You know, I see this all the time, and we've been trained to go into this type of mentality.
[02:12:59.385 --> 02:13:07.051]  There are like 15 army reports saying torture, urinating on Korans, beating people to death, raping women.
[02:13:07.071 --> 02:13:11.035]  75-90% of those at the camps in Iraq are totally innocent, picked up at checkpoints.
[02:13:12.236 --> 02:13:14.337]  General Tagumbo report, all of this stuff.
[02:13:15.638 --> 02:13:16.039]  Okay?
[02:13:17.300 --> 02:13:20.062]  And then Newsweek goes, and some interpreter says,
[02:13:21.661 --> 02:13:24.083]  The Arab says they pottied on it.
[02:13:24.784 --> 02:13:27.726]  And then that turns into toilet and is mistranslated into toilet.
[02:13:28.587 --> 02:13:30.989]  And then Newsley goes, we correct ourselves.
[02:13:31.149 --> 02:13:32.650]  They just urinated on it.
[02:13:33.030 --> 02:13:34.652]  They didn't flush it down the toilet.
[02:13:34.972 --> 02:13:37.254]  Oh my gosh, it's all discredited now.
[02:13:37.714 --> 02:13:38.675]  Oh my goodness.
[02:13:39.516 --> 02:13:40.977]  Give me a break.
[02:13:42.979 --> 02:13:44.260]  Give me a break.
[02:13:45.020 --> 02:13:48.783]  General Rick Baucus quit Camp X-Ray refusing to torture.
[02:13:49.084 --> 02:13:49.164]  AP.
[02:13:51.701 --> 02:13:55.563]  One of the chief interrogators a month ago quit refusing to torture.
[02:13:56.604 --> 02:13:59.526]  Times of London, BBC, not any American publication.
[02:14:01.407 --> 02:14:02.287]  Oh, please.
[02:14:02.347 --> 02:14:04.569]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[02:14:05.689 --> 02:14:06.730]  It's unbelievable.
[02:14:07.991 --> 02:14:10.152]  So, I mean, it just blows my mind, Mike.
[02:14:10.692 --> 02:14:11.733]  Got better things to do.
[02:14:13.894 --> 02:14:17.936]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:14:17.956 --> 02:14:19.758]  Dan in Texas.
[02:14:19.798 --> 02:14:20.378]  Go ahead, Dan.
[02:14:21.144 --> 02:14:21.544]  Hey, Alex.
[02:14:22.885 --> 02:14:22.985]  Hi.
[02:14:23.005 --> 02:14:25.707]  The 10-year figure was the fact that he was tenured.
[02:14:25.787 --> 02:14:28.109]  He had worked there for over 10 years.
[02:14:28.169 --> 02:14:33.092]  Yeah, so he was tenured, and he hasn't been there for a couple years.
[02:14:33.672 --> 02:14:38.976]  The main thing about these whistleblowers is that they don't have any insider information.
[02:14:39.376 --> 02:14:44.239]  They're just people like us who look at the evidence and draw the obvious conclusion.
[02:14:44.279 --> 02:14:49.702]  The only thing that's important to bring them out, like people like Bonjulo or Reynolds or these other people, or...
[02:14:51.429 --> 02:14:56.153]  Is that they're respectful, obviously intelligent, serious, not crazy people.
[02:14:56.453 --> 02:14:58.414]  Well, some of them do have inside knowledge.
[02:14:58.454 --> 02:15:00.936]  I mean, Meacher does have inside knowledge.
[02:15:01.276 --> 02:15:06.500]  Some of these... His essay was basically based on what he'd read on the Internet.
[02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:06.880]  Yes.
[02:15:07.801 --> 02:15:10.763]  It was based on public statements by PNAC.
[02:15:10.823 --> 02:15:13.125]  Let me talk about last night real quick.
[02:15:13.185 --> 02:15:14.666]  I thought you did a really good job.
[02:15:15.066 --> 02:15:18.028]  I thought you were a little too rare in the go at the beginning, but you settled in.
[02:15:18.228 --> 02:15:18.969]  You settled in, and...
[02:15:19.873 --> 02:15:21.394]  I couldn't believe the Peter Lance guy.
[02:15:21.414 --> 02:15:22.014]  He blew my mind.
[02:15:22.074 --> 02:15:23.975]  I wrote him a little email at 4 a.m.
[02:15:24.656 --> 02:15:31.799]  saying, how can you agree that Building 7 was a demolition, but still slam anyone who says the government orchestrated 9-11?
[02:15:32.540 --> 02:15:35.421]  And he wrote me back saying, oh, you know, U.S.
[02:15:35.501 --> 02:15:37.923]  embassies abroad are always wired to blow.
[02:15:37.943 --> 02:15:41.644]  I was like, wow, this guy really believes it.
[02:15:42.105 --> 02:15:46.367]  And it's just like, well, maybe, but if you agree it was a controlled demolition...
[02:15:46.789 --> 02:15:50.211]  You know, there's a lot more logical places to go with that.
[02:15:50.431 --> 02:15:57.255]  Look at the mental gymnastics, jumping through hundreds of flaming hoops backwards while playing tiddlywinks.
[02:15:58.396 --> 02:15:58.576]  Right.
[02:15:58.996 --> 02:16:01.518]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[02:16:01.778 --> 02:16:03.459]  Well, I thought David Ray Griffin made a great point.
[02:16:03.499 --> 02:16:09.403]  He said, look, you can have a hypothesis on 9-11, but a good hypothesis takes into account all the facts.
[02:16:09.823 --> 02:16:15.766]  Yeah, you could just look at FBI court records and come up with a theory that Al Qaeda is this great, you know, horrible...
[02:16:17.316 --> 02:16:19.578]  Well, have you noticed that I look at the entire continuum of data?
[02:16:40.031 --> 02:16:40.672]  We're good to go.
[02:16:40.732 --> 02:16:41.133]  We're good to go.
[02:16:57.802 --> 02:17:04.487]  Maybe you thought it was incompetence, but then when you see all the demolition, uh, hello, or maybe you thought it was Al-Qaeda, but how did Al-Qaeda wire Building 7?
[02:17:04.928 --> 02:17:10.212]  Well, then you look at the history of Al-Qaeda, CIA, then you look at the motives, then you look at FBI ordered to stand down.
[02:17:10.852 --> 02:17:12.934]  You look at the public officials warned not to fly.
[02:17:12.954 --> 02:17:14.655]  You look at CIA insider trading.
[02:17:14.855 --> 02:17:17.197]  You look at the CIA saying they don't want to capture bin Laden.
[02:17:17.217 --> 02:17:18.738]  You look at them flying the bin Ladens out.
[02:17:18.998 --> 02:17:22.601]  You look at them flying Al-Qaeda and Taliban cream out of Afghanistan.
[02:17:23.462 --> 02:17:24.643]  On and on and on.
[02:17:24.663 --> 02:17:27.565]  There is no other way to look at it when you look at the data.
[02:17:28.621 --> 02:17:29.562]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:17:29.582 --> 02:17:31.363]  It's just mind-blowing.
[02:17:31.804 --> 02:17:33.725]  I think y'all did a great service overall.
[02:17:33.745 --> 02:17:34.846]  I think a lot of people woke up.
[02:17:35.026 --> 02:17:35.667]  All right, thank you.
[02:17:35.687 --> 02:17:38.509]  All right, just masses of calls straight ahead.
[02:17:38.529 --> 02:17:38.589]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:17:38.609 --> 02:17:40.430]  President of Planet Dog TV and Infowars.com.
[02:17:46.611 --> 02:17:53.493]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[02:17:54.013 --> 02:17:59.434]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Nonex Nail Gel.
[02:17:59.854 --> 02:18:09.856]  All-natural Nonex is a topical, ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[02:18:09.996 --> 02:18:12.277]  Nonex Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[02:18:12.717 --> 02:18:15.799]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[02:18:15.899 --> 02:18:17.420]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[02:18:17.540 --> 02:18:25.024]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[02:18:25.284 --> 02:18:27.005]  It's also money-back guarantee.
[02:18:27.365 --> 02:18:39.032]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Long's, Brooks, and independent pharmacies nationwide, or online at drugstore.com.
[02:18:39.613 --> 02:18:40.818]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:18:41.059 --> 02:18:43.971]  For clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[02:18:45.899 --> 02:18:48.762]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:18:49.122 --> 02:18:52.005]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:18:52.225 --> 02:18:58.430]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[02:19:46.286 --> 02:19:48.507]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[02:19:48.927 --> 02:19:53.288]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[02:19:53.568 --> 02:19:59.370]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[02:19:59.610 --> 02:20:03.652]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[02:20:03.952 --> 02:20:08.833]  However, they have become the elite group more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[02:20:08.853 --> 02:20:10.094]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[02:20:14.415 --> 02:20:18.316]  By mid-1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[02:20:18.356 --> 02:20:20.737]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[02:20:21.077 --> 02:20:23.378]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[02:20:23.758 --> 02:20:27.379]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[02:20:27.859 --> 02:20:34.060]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[02:20:34.501 --> 02:20:35.481]  You'll be glad you did.
[02:20:35.821 --> 02:20:36.161]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:36.201 --> 02:20:36.441]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:45.060 --> 02:20:47.401]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:20:47.641 --> 02:20:51.481]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[02:20:51.802 --> 02:20:52.622]  Read the labels.
[02:20:53.042 --> 02:20:57.163]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:20:57.383 --> 02:21:01.584]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:21:01.964 --> 02:21:06.825]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:21:07.225 --> 02:21:10.827]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:21:10.987 --> 02:21:16.330]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:21:16.610 --> 02:21:19.331]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:21:19.632 --> 02:21:20.532]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:21:20.832 --> 02:21:31.558]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[02:21:33.380 --> 02:21:34.682]  That's 800-340-7091 or visit calbendpuresoap.com.
[02:21:56.389 --> 02:22:02.212]  You know, we might as well play that clip of Larry Silverstein saying they made the decision to pull the building.
[02:22:03.252 --> 02:22:11.276]  And then later in the documentary, they say pull means demolish, and it shows them demolishing other surrounding buildings months later, and they go, get ready to pull it!
[02:22:12.317 --> 02:22:14.458]  And they go, when we get ready to pull it, we demolish the building.
[02:22:14.878 --> 02:22:21.061]  But this is him talking about the afternoon, you know, 5.30 something Eastern, when they pulled building 7.
[02:22:21.721 --> 02:22:24.643]  And here's Silverstein commenting on it in a sit-down interview.
[02:22:24.663 --> 02:22:24.903]  Play it.
[02:22:25.640 --> 02:22:31.845]  I remember getting a call from the fire department commander telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[02:22:33.466 --> 02:22:35.427]  I said, you know, we've had such terrible loss of life.
[02:22:35.447 --> 02:22:38.389]  Maybe the smallest thing to do is pull.
[02:22:39.810 --> 02:22:41.331]  And they made that decision to pull.
[02:22:41.692 --> 02:22:44.834]  And then we watched the building collapse.
[02:22:45.454 --> 02:22:47.396]  You know, something this big, you can't cover it up.
[02:22:47.416 --> 02:22:49.637]  People always say, well, it's just so big.
[02:22:50.218 --> 02:22:51.419]  They've never been able to cover it up.
[02:22:51.459 --> 02:22:52.519]  They haven't covered it up.
[02:22:52.860 --> 02:22:54.601]  They just count on you being gullible.
[02:22:55.188 --> 02:23:00.772]  It's like I'm shooting Kennedy full of ten holes and going, one bullet hit him.
[02:23:02.793 --> 02:23:05.054]  They do it right in front of you and then tell you what you saw.
[02:23:06.695 --> 02:23:07.956]  You've got to stop buying into that.
[02:23:09.057 --> 02:23:09.797]  Who's up next here?
[02:23:12.539 --> 02:23:13.560]  Randy in New Mexico.
[02:23:13.600 --> 02:23:13.960]  Go ahead.
[02:23:13.980 --> 02:23:14.500]  You're on the air.
[02:23:15.021 --> 02:23:15.681]  Yes, Alex.
[02:23:15.761 --> 02:23:17.602]  It's an honor to finally get to talk to you.
[02:23:17.803 --> 02:23:18.943]  No, it's an honor to talk to you.
[02:23:18.963 --> 02:23:19.524]  What's on your mind?
[02:23:19.764 --> 02:23:22.966]  Well, I listened to the show last night, this morning.
[02:23:23.621 --> 02:23:25.142]  Well, I did ask that once.
[02:23:42.273 --> 02:23:43.594]  Briefly, though.
[02:23:43.975 --> 02:23:48.639]  It was very briefly, and they kept cutting you off.
[02:23:48.900 --> 02:23:52.123]  No, for several of the hours I sat there making notes.
[02:23:52.183 --> 02:23:54.165]  I have an atomic clock at each of my offices.
[02:23:54.185 --> 02:23:55.386]  There's one right in front of me right now.
[02:23:55.446 --> 02:24:01.252]  It's 1, 26, and 12 seconds Central Standard Time as of this live transmission.
[02:24:01.892 --> 02:24:04.515]  And I was marking down, he did monopolize.
[02:24:05.442 --> 02:24:06.723]  Yes, he did.
[02:24:06.763 --> 02:24:09.885]  From the onset, he continuously attacked you from the beginning of the show.
[02:24:10.185 --> 02:24:11.746]  Well, that's all they can do.
[02:24:12.066 --> 02:24:12.846]  He can't do anything else.
[02:24:12.866 --> 02:24:15.848]  Jones did a good job for even having the show, but I just didn't understand that.
[02:24:16.088 --> 02:24:16.828]  One more quick thing.
[02:24:17.028 --> 02:24:25.753]  What do you say to people, I have an aunt back in Arkansas before I moved out here, who asked me when the elections were going on.
[02:24:25.913 --> 02:24:26.694]  I wasn't voting.
[02:24:27.174 --> 02:24:30.616]  She asked me who I would vote for if I voted, and I told her the other guy, not Bush.
[02:24:31.511 --> 02:24:35.123]  And she told me I needed to get down on my knees and ask God to forgive me.
[02:24:36.365 --> 02:24:37.325]  We're not voting for Bush.
[02:24:37.585 --> 02:24:41.867]  Well, I mean, again, I will tell you, sir, that there's no difference between Kerry.
[02:24:41.887 --> 02:24:43.807]  Yes, I know.
[02:24:44.107 --> 02:24:47.468]  So, I mean, in that respect, your mom might be right.
[02:24:47.488 --> 02:24:51.509]  But, no, they kick people out of churches if they don't basically worship George Bush.
[02:24:52.450 --> 02:24:55.010]  They think he's basically a disciple.
[02:24:55.070 --> 02:24:57.231]  He's like some type of new prophet.
[02:24:57.691 --> 02:25:04.473]  And he's so Christian and so good when he's not telling Ozzy Osbourne jokes or talking about sex with animals on public TV with his wife.
[02:25:05.157 --> 02:25:05.917]  Did you hear about that?
[02:25:06.157 --> 02:25:06.537]  Yes.
[02:25:06.577 --> 02:25:09.578]  When he's not worshipping at a Shinto shrine or praying to Allah.
[02:25:10.038 --> 02:25:11.839]  And of course, we know what he really does in his off time.
[02:25:11.879 --> 02:25:13.819]  When he really is alone, it's worshipping Moloch.
[02:25:14.920 --> 02:25:17.280]  So, I mean, it's just... They're in denial.
[02:25:17.340 --> 02:25:18.041]  Thank you for the call.
[02:25:18.781 --> 02:25:19.861]  John in New York.
[02:25:19.901 --> 02:25:20.581]  John, go ahead.
[02:25:23.262 --> 02:25:23.462]  Yes?
[02:25:23.642 --> 02:25:23.902]  Hello?
[02:25:24.022 --> 02:25:25.263]  Hi, Alex.
[02:25:25.363 --> 02:25:26.103]  Great show last night.
[02:25:26.323 --> 02:25:28.143]  I have three things I'd like to say.
[02:25:28.163 --> 02:25:31.584]  First of all, like you said before, you can go on to...
[02:25:34.298 --> 02:25:36.399]  The website of Norrie's website.
[02:25:36.820 --> 02:25:39.361]  And for like $5 and change, you can listen to the show.
[02:25:39.381 --> 02:25:42.263]  As a matter of fact, I might do it because I missed the question of the last hour.
[02:25:42.283 --> 02:25:43.144]  We didn't pick it up here.
[02:25:44.144 --> 02:25:47.186]  Second of all, nobody has said anything about George Norrie.
[02:25:47.427 --> 02:25:50.328]  And I would like to give him three cheers.
[02:25:50.869 --> 02:25:55.692]  And I, like one of his listeners, did say that I think he does deserve some kind of Medal of Honor.
[02:25:56.492 --> 02:26:01.876]  I know because, and I think we should keep him in our prayers and his family protection also.
[02:26:03.437 --> 02:26:09.398]  Before I came to your show, two and a half years ago... By the way, you know he was rear-ended mysteriously by somebody without a driver's license.
[02:26:09.438 --> 02:26:11.199]  Yes, I heard him say that later, yeah.
[02:26:11.499 --> 02:26:14.359]  A car smashed to bits, and he barely made it on air.
[02:26:14.659 --> 02:26:16.800]  Well, I thought about that, too, and I'm going, wow.
[02:26:17.400 --> 02:26:18.240]  I heard him say that.
[02:26:18.600 --> 02:26:24.101]  But the reason why I'm saying that is because I was turned on to your show two and a half years ago.
[02:26:24.761 --> 02:26:27.061]  And before that, I was an avid listener to Art Bell.
[02:26:27.662 --> 02:26:30.122]  So I saw Nuri for about six, seven years.
[02:26:30.905 --> 02:26:36.048]  I heard of Norrie before Art Bell and when he's filled in for Art, when he took over the show and stuff like that.
[02:26:36.128 --> 02:26:42.731]  I really have to commend the guy because he's on mainstream media and he really stuck his neck out.
[02:26:42.751 --> 02:26:49.174]  I just wanted to say also be aware that his listening audience is not geared for this.
[02:26:49.827 --> 02:26:54.492]  There are more gear for chupacabras, UFOs, all that kind of stuff, you know, which was a holdover for Mark.
[02:26:54.532 --> 02:26:56.274]  Sneaky, snappy goblins.
[02:26:56.655 --> 02:27:03.963]  Yeah, so what I'm trying to say is that as a listener, when I was turned on to your show, it was a completely shock to my system.
[02:27:04.243 --> 02:27:08.848]  I mean, I was pinching myself so hard for six months, I had bruises all over, just to see if I was still awake.
[02:27:09.829 --> 02:27:10.150]  And, um...
[02:27:11.695 --> 02:27:20.640]  The last thing I'd like to say is also I'm surprised nobody came back when that CIA guy was so definite in what he was saying about the bombs and the nukes and stuff like that.
[02:27:20.680 --> 02:27:30.245]  How come nobody said, and I would have liked for somebody to say, well, if you know so much and you know these things and you're so sure it's going to happen, where did these, who brought them in?
[02:27:30.385 --> 02:27:32.407]  You're saying somebody brought them in?
[02:27:32.427 --> 02:27:33.007]  No, I hear you.
[02:27:33.027 --> 02:27:33.867]  Thanks for the call.
[02:27:33.887 --> 02:27:34.948]  Stay with us.
[02:27:36.110 --> 02:27:37.012]  We're on the march.

[02:27:40.059 --> 02:27:42.745]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.746 --> 02:27:47.907]  Ever wish your kid came with an instruction manual?

[02:28:15.775 --> 02:28:22.877]  When my son started having behavior problems, the total transformation techniques were like the instruction manual on how to deal with him.
[02:28:23.097 --> 02:28:24.397]  We got immediate results.
[02:28:24.898 --> 02:28:26.978]  Do you need an instruction manual for your kid?
[02:28:27.438 --> 02:28:35.660]  I'm behavioral therapist James Lehman, and I'll show you how to change your child's behavior now with the total transformation, the program that helps stop defiance and backtalking.
[02:28:35.901 --> 02:28:37.221]  Your child will listen to you again.
[02:28:37.241 --> 02:28:38.121]  I guarantee it.
[02:28:38.421 --> 02:28:38.901]  Call now.

[02:29:45.031 --> 02:29:52.498]  This is Wendy Malek from Just Shoot Me, here to tell you about Pets 911, a free public service changing the way we care for pets in every community nationwide.

[02:30:58.543 --> 02:31:01.424]  And as soon as you hear a caller hang up, it's your chance to call in.
[02:31:01.444 --> 02:31:06.527]  The first time today, at least 30 seconds ago, we had one phone line open.
[02:31:06.547 --> 02:31:06.607]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:31:06.627 --> 02:31:07.708]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:31:07.728 --> 02:31:09.329]  Be ready, folks, because I'm going to you.
[02:31:09.489 --> 02:31:10.889]  I'm going to give you 45 seconds.
[02:31:12.150 --> 02:31:13.090]  I'm going to comment for 15 seconds.
[02:31:22.446 --> 02:31:23.907]  But before I do that, the news.
[02:31:24.567 --> 02:31:28.489]  All of President Bush's approval numbers are plunging, but again, the global elite use him as a puppet.
[02:31:28.809 --> 02:31:29.670]  He takes the blame.
[02:31:29.710 --> 02:31:31.211]  Their policies continue on.
[02:31:32.031 --> 02:31:34.613]  White House castigates Durbin for remarks.
[02:31:34.693 --> 02:31:38.215]  Associated Press, Senator Dick Durbin called it a death camp.
[02:31:38.235 --> 02:31:39.375]  It clearly is.
[02:31:39.455 --> 02:31:42.137]  Then he gave all these lame examples of how it was a death camp.
[02:31:42.157 --> 02:31:43.818]  I think that's a staged event.
[02:31:45.018 --> 02:31:51.922]  We hear about this big call to shut down one of their archipelago of gulags, of camps, of torture bases.
[02:31:53.041 --> 02:31:58.626]  And their response, Halliburton to build a new $30 million Guantanamo jail.
[02:31:58.686 --> 02:32:05.672]  Reuters reports a Halliburton company unit will build a new $30 million detention facility and security fence at the U.S.
[02:32:05.712 --> 02:32:15.340]  Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where the United States is holding about 520 foreign terrorism suspects that the Defense Department announced last night.
[02:32:16.881 --> 02:32:17.442]  Continuing...
[02:32:18.408 --> 02:32:18.688]  U.S.
[02:32:18.748 --> 02:32:21.671]  lied to Britain over use of napalm in Iraq war.
[02:32:21.731 --> 02:32:33.500]  London Independent American officials lied to British ministers over the use of internationally reviled napalm-type firebombs in Iraq because they're the complete opposite of precision-guided munitions.
[02:32:34.220 --> 02:32:46.470]  Yesterday's disclosure led to calls by members of Parliament for a full statement to the Commons and open ministers to allegations that they had held back the facts until after the general election.
[02:32:47.994 --> 02:32:51.577]  11th Circuit okays RICO suit involving illegal aliens.
[02:32:51.657 --> 02:32:56.722]  This out of the Fulton County Daily Report.
[02:32:58.703 --> 02:33:04.308]  A federal appeals court has denied efforts by carpet and flooring giant Mohawk Industries Inc.
[02:33:04.688 --> 02:33:07.371]  to kill a racketeering class action lawsuit.
[02:33:07.891 --> 02:33:15.858]  The suit claims that the Georgia company recruited and employed illegal aliens in order to depress wages of legitimate employees.
[02:33:16.696 --> 02:33:19.858]  In a June 9th, how many times have I said, sue for racketeering?
[02:33:21.319 --> 02:33:25.983]  In a June 9th per curiam decision of the 11th Circuit U.S.
[02:33:26.403 --> 02:33:30.686]  Court of Appeals panel, held key elements of a ruling by U.S.
[02:33:30.726 --> 02:33:33.889]  District Judge Harold L. Murphy that allowed the case to proceed.
[02:33:34.529 --> 02:33:36.550]  All the decision comes at an early stage in the case.
[02:33:36.590 --> 02:33:38.172]  The matter could be handled by the U.S.
[02:33:38.192 --> 02:33:42.775]  Supreme Court because the 11th Circuit reasoning splits with another circuit.
[02:33:43.578 --> 02:33:52.363]  The four plaintiffs, who are current and former Mohawk employees, are alleging federal and state violations of the Racketeering, Influence, and Corrupt Organizations Act.
[02:33:52.403 --> 02:34:00.588]  They accuse the company of working with employee recruiters who hire illegal aliens in Texas and Georgia, often providing them with phony Social Security cards.
[02:34:00.628 --> 02:34:05.511]  The suit also alleges that Mohawk hid illegal workers during law enforcement inspections.
[02:34:08.417 --> 02:34:11.060]  And you watch the big federal courts throw this out.
[02:34:11.340 --> 02:34:13.402]  But this is the right direction.
[02:34:13.442 --> 02:34:14.262]  This is the way to go.
[02:34:15.604 --> 02:34:19.047]  Israel to build underwater barrier to prevent attacks.
[02:34:19.067 --> 02:34:19.807]  It's not a drudge.
[02:34:19.867 --> 02:34:29.736]  Israel is to build an underwater security barrier on its coastal border with the Gaza Strip in a bid to prevent the infiltration from the sea by would-be Palestinian attackers.
[02:34:30.277 --> 02:34:31.538]  Security sources said, right.
[02:34:32.136 --> 02:34:37.860]  They built this gigantic 30-foot wall, too, with machine gun nests, but we can't have that on our border.
[02:34:37.900 --> 02:34:39.982]  Oh, no, our Border Patrol has got to stand down.
[02:34:44.025 --> 02:34:53.091]  Bizarre reports all over the place about PETA, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
[02:34:54.292 --> 02:34:57.735]  And I had heard this from someone who'd worked for PETA, and that's why they got out of it.
[02:34:59.682 --> 02:35:03.805]  That they would pressure employees to euthanize their animals just for no reason.
[02:35:03.825 --> 02:35:04.946]  They were just into killing them.
[02:35:06.788 --> 02:35:11.191]  And that the leaders of it would literally have beef gobbling.
[02:35:12.392 --> 02:35:16.795]  The way it was described is just reveling and eating hamburgers.
[02:35:17.276 --> 02:35:18.757]  It's like a big joke or something.
[02:35:19.758 --> 02:35:21.319]  But this is bizarre, cult-like.
[02:35:22.342 --> 02:35:23.783]  They've been caught red-handed.
[02:35:23.803 --> 02:35:30.287]  The police heard about them dumping over and over again, and sometimes up to 18 animals at a time in a dumpster.
[02:35:31.167 --> 02:35:39.992]  And they would send in PETA employees all over the place to animal shelters to get animals that were going to be adopted out and to claim they were going to adopt them, and they would just kill them.
[02:35:42.433 --> 02:35:44.915]  I mean, just see how weird that is.
[02:35:44.935 --> 02:35:47.356]  I mean, imagine all the time and energy.
[02:35:47.796 --> 02:35:50.538]  They support Peter Singer, who calls...
[02:35:51.756 --> 02:35:55.579]  Babies, mackerel up to 18 months, as valuable as a mackerel fish is the quote.
[02:35:56.020 --> 02:35:57.000]  It's big federal money.
[02:35:57.141 --> 02:36:01.624]  Old people, worthless, retarded children, subhuman.
[02:36:02.225 --> 02:36:04.106]  They're a very, very sick group, folks.
[02:36:05.788 --> 02:36:08.310]  Big quake, what comes after four?
[02:36:08.330 --> 02:36:12.173]  I mean, they've had 5.2s, 7.2s, off the coast, 6.1s, another earthquake last night.
[02:36:16.642 --> 02:36:18.163]  It's just going on and on.
[02:36:18.223 --> 02:36:19.664]  Four earthquakes in the last few days.
[02:36:19.684 --> 02:36:21.185]  It's a dangerous area.
[02:36:21.205 --> 02:36:22.385]  A lot of seismic activity.
[02:36:22.405 --> 02:36:25.387]  The whole Earth's seismic activity has spiked dramatically.
[02:36:25.827 --> 02:36:37.674]  Everybody's pulling their hair out with glee and happiness that major publications like Salon and others are finally reporting on declassified documents from 2000.
[02:36:39.335 --> 02:36:41.537]  Actually, these were ordered and released by Congress.
[02:36:41.717 --> 02:36:43.718]  The Congressman's grandson was damaged by all of it.
[02:36:44.198 --> 02:36:45.659]  This is really old news, but
[02:36:46.760 --> 02:36:52.082]  Deadly immunity when a study revealed that a mercury in childhood vaccines may have caused autism in thousands of kids.
[02:36:52.422 --> 02:36:59.085]  The government rushed to conceal the data and to prevent parents from suing drug companies for their role in the epidemic.
[02:37:00.225 --> 02:37:11.409]  And in June of 2000, a group of top government scientists and health officials gathered for a meeting at the isolated Simpson-Wood Conference Center in Georgia, convened by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
[02:37:11.429 --> 02:37:13.890]  It's an eight-page article, and it's the old quotes of
[02:37:14.961 --> 02:37:16.782]  I'm not going to let my grandchildren get this.
[02:37:16.822 --> 02:37:17.522]  This is deadly.
[02:37:17.562 --> 02:37:18.602]  Millions have been damaged.
[02:37:18.622 --> 02:37:19.903]  We've got to cover it up.
[02:37:19.923 --> 02:37:20.823]  The quotes are all there.
[02:37:21.663 --> 02:37:22.743]  And it's back in the news.
[02:37:24.264 --> 02:37:27.185]  This time being picked up by Salon and others.
[02:37:27.245 --> 02:37:29.345]  That's some good news.
[02:37:29.986 --> 02:37:30.766]  USDA
[02:37:32.633 --> 02:37:35.755]  Plants its own pro-cafta news, Chicago Tribune.
[02:37:36.095 --> 02:37:36.335]  The U.S.
[02:37:36.355 --> 02:37:46.902]  Department of Agriculture has churned out three dozen radio and television news segments since the first of the year that promote the controversial trade agreement with Central America opposed by labor unions.
[02:37:47.823 --> 02:38:00.952]  The sugar industry and many members of Congress, including some Republicans, amid an intense debate over government-funded efforts to influence news coverage, the prepackaged reports have been widely distributed to broadcast outlets across the country for easy insertion into newscasts.
[02:38:02.011 --> 02:38:03.492]  Just like all the other fake newscasts.
[02:38:04.953 --> 02:38:22.427]  And I heard Gary Brownsell reading a Seattle Post-Intelligencer article today, right before my broadcast, about a family-owned dairy that supplies, I think, what is it, 40,000 people a day with deliveries of milk to their homes at a little bit below normal milk prices.
[02:38:23.968 --> 02:38:26.069]  They've been around for decades.
[02:38:26.490 --> 02:38:28.131]  They're just an old family dairy.
[02:38:29.349 --> 02:38:36.534]  And they're going to order them shut down, not because of bad milk or any problems, but because they're competing with the other dairies.
[02:38:37.895 --> 02:38:41.318]  They're doing it under regulatory... I mean, this is the type of control we're talking about.
[02:38:43.039 --> 02:38:46.221]  All right, let's go to your calls here, rapid fire.
[02:38:47.502 --> 02:38:52.186]  Let's... Who is up next?
[02:38:53.613 --> 02:38:54.734]  Leslie in Virginia.
[02:38:54.754 --> 02:38:55.595]  Go ahead, Leslie.
[02:38:56.556 --> 02:38:57.477]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:38:57.557 --> 02:39:02.842]  I want to say kudos to George Norway for Coast to Coast for doing this.
[02:39:03.302 --> 02:39:07.066]  Because I can tell you, Alex, I give him the highest marks.
[02:39:07.106 --> 02:39:17.155]  Now, I give you high marks, but in all fairness, Alex, Mr. Lance was either in denial, lacked information to even debate you.
[02:39:17.775 --> 02:39:19.017]  And I just wish that...
[02:39:19.764 --> 02:39:27.009]  Mr. Norrie will bring you back as soon as he can with a better guest that can debate.
[02:39:27.089 --> 02:39:30.452]  Because Mr. Lance lacked the knowledge.
[02:39:32.894 --> 02:39:33.834]  I mean, it was pathetic.
[02:39:33.974 --> 02:39:35.335]  It was absolutely pathetic.
[02:39:35.416 --> 02:39:36.556]  It was a total knockout.
[02:39:37.277 --> 02:39:39.919]  And, you know, he can find somebody better than this.
[02:39:41.520 --> 02:39:42.960]  It was that pathetic.
[02:39:43.041 --> 02:39:51.283]  In fact, I fell asleep after listening to you, and I had my other friends they were all listening to, about an hour and a half.
[02:39:51.363 --> 02:39:54.524]  I said, oh, gee, I mean, you know, what is this, a cakewalk?
[02:39:56.565 --> 02:39:57.445]  Thanks for the call.
[02:39:58.005 --> 02:39:59.485]  Oh, go ahead.
[02:39:59.926 --> 02:40:07.928]  I just want to say I'm going to see if I can't contact him and bring somebody more knowledgeable and a stronger guest.
[02:40:08.766 --> 02:40:10.127]  All right, thank you for the call.
[02:40:10.148 --> 02:40:17.114]  Look, Chertoff likes to write hit pieces on me and then act like the Homeland Security Director's first cousin.
[02:40:18.316 --> 02:40:19.877]  Likes to act like that I won't debate him.
[02:40:19.937 --> 02:40:22.960]  I've called him, I don't know, probably six, seven times.
[02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:24.001]  He won't come on here.
[02:40:24.882 --> 02:40:26.263]  They really can't debate, folks.
[02:40:26.283 --> 02:40:27.525]  I mean, I said I couldn't lose.
[02:40:28.326 --> 02:40:30.728]  I said all they can do is personal attacks, and that indeed happens.
[02:40:31.522 --> 02:40:32.762]  You cannot defeat the truth.
[02:40:32.802 --> 02:40:34.603]  You cannot defeat the preponderance of evidence.
[02:40:34.663 --> 02:40:37.303]  The weight of the evidence is mammoth.
[02:40:37.403 --> 02:40:38.804]  It is galaxy-sized.
[02:40:40.024 --> 02:40:42.405]  It is a continuum of data.
[02:40:43.365 --> 02:40:47.886]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeremy in Pennsylvania.
[02:40:47.906 --> 02:40:48.626]  Jeremy, go ahead.
[02:40:48.646 --> 02:40:50.327]  Hello, Alex.
[02:40:50.407 --> 02:40:57.389]  I was wondering if you have the Grove ticker tape that says Bush was talking about the vice presidential decision.
[02:40:57.429 --> 02:40:59.149]  I checked out the Bohemian Grove video, but...
[02:41:00.595 --> 02:41:06.181]  I mean, I know that's more, as you say, dancing on the head of a pin, but that's something I'd like to just take a peek at.
[02:41:06.942 --> 02:41:12.668]  Well, what happened is I got back from the Bohemian Grove in July of 2000.
[02:41:13.188 --> 02:41:14.169]  I'd been there for a week.
[02:41:14.770 --> 02:41:18.253]  Snuck in for just about five hours on one day, July 15th.
[02:41:19.993 --> 02:41:31.076]  And CNN did announce, it has been quoted in newspapers, my mother was sitting there watching it on TV days before they came to Austin and announced that it would be Dick Cheney.
[02:41:31.516 --> 02:41:43.279]  The paraphrased quote was, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell, was there at a Northern California retreat, Bohemian Grove, with George Bush Sr.
[02:41:44.139 --> 02:41:45.019]  and Brent Scrocoff,
[02:41:46.036 --> 02:41:54.018]  And the decision was made to advise Governor Bush to pick Dick Cheney as his running mate.
[02:41:54.898 --> 02:42:04.941]  And so I was able to find a blurb on CNN about it, and I was able to talk to a lot of people who did see it, and that is admitted, and they do indeed go there.
[02:42:04.981 --> 02:42:05.821]  We have their annals.
[02:42:06.721 --> 02:42:08.762]  And so that's on record.
[02:42:09.284 --> 02:42:09.904]  Oh, I believe you.
[02:42:09.924 --> 02:42:12.545]  I just wanted to know if it was somewhere on a prison planet.
[02:42:13.625 --> 02:42:15.506]  I believe it is somewhere, but do me a favor.
[02:42:15.526 --> 02:42:15.966]  I'll tell you what.
[02:42:16.046 --> 02:42:18.326]  You go to the library, or you go to CNN.
[02:42:18.386 --> 02:42:26.449]  I think that was announced probably about the 25th or so, because it was about a week after I got back.
[02:42:28.169 --> 02:42:32.310]  Why don't you go and get the clip from CNN for me?
[02:42:32.950 --> 02:42:33.351]  Okay.
[02:42:33.491 --> 02:42:34.131]  Would you help me?
[02:42:34.151 --> 02:42:34.791]  Sure.
[02:42:35.327 --> 02:42:36.808]  Yeah.
[02:42:36.948 --> 02:42:46.596]  Unless the Earth expands its orbit around the Sun, and then we change to a longer sleep-wake cycle, I can't do much more.
[02:42:46.677 --> 02:42:47.257]  Thanks for the call.
[02:42:47.497 --> 02:42:48.198]  Okay, thank you.
[02:42:48.358 --> 02:42:49.139]  I appreciate it.
[02:42:50.460 --> 02:42:53.203]  Let's go ahead and go to another caller here.
[02:42:53.263 --> 02:42:55.725]  Let's talk to Tony in Arkansas.
[02:42:55.745 --> 02:42:56.326]  Welcome, Tony.
[02:42:56.586 --> 02:42:57.647]  Alex, great to talk to you.
[02:42:57.667 --> 02:42:58.207]  God bless you.
[02:42:58.228 --> 02:42:59.429]  You did a great job last night.
[02:42:59.649 --> 02:42:59.949]  Thanks.
[02:43:00.309 --> 02:43:01.871]  I wanted to make two quick statements.
[02:43:02.071 --> 02:43:09.538]  One, just as staffers, I know some friends who have worked with Asa Hutchinson, former number two at Homeland Security.
[02:43:09.558 --> 02:43:11.620]  She's going to run for governor here in our state next election.
[02:43:12.120 --> 02:43:13.822]  But there has never been a mood.
[02:43:14.378 --> 02:43:22.121]  In Washington, so surly as right now, not even when Clinton was impeached in the House, to remove someone from office.
[02:43:22.161 --> 02:43:23.862]  They're Republicans ready to box.
[02:43:23.942 --> 02:43:31.925]  I just want to come alongside some of the things that were said last night and just encourage people, please let your congressmen, your senators know you want Bush impeached.
[02:43:32.005 --> 02:43:32.805]  Bush and Cheney.
[02:43:32.885 --> 02:43:33.545]  Emphasize that.
[02:43:33.605 --> 02:43:40.668]  They must be impeached because if we don't get them on the backpedal, they are scrambling right now, just as you revealed with Bilderberg.
[02:43:41.127 --> 02:43:42.408]  They're scrambling in areas.
[02:43:42.428 --> 02:43:44.208]  They fought resistance they didn't expect.
[02:43:44.288 --> 02:43:47.110]  And if you get them backpedaling, you may save the world.
[02:43:47.530 --> 02:43:49.991]  So please, if we can try to impeach these individuals.
[02:43:50.811 --> 02:43:53.212]  And secondly, but please, I beg people, call in.
[02:43:53.593 --> 02:44:01.216]  Secondly, last night I believe Peter Lance was a shrill for them because right out of the gate, I'm a former Republican in the Matrix kind of thing, too.
[02:44:01.835 --> 02:44:11.362]  He comes out and calls you a liberal, Rush Limbaugh, and that would immediately tune out, you know, the so-called Republicans that may have tuned in and said, oh, that's what this guy is.
[02:44:11.783 --> 02:44:12.783]  And then he just continued.
[02:44:12.803 --> 02:44:16.526]  No, he immediately tried to balkanize and then shut out half the audience.
[02:44:16.826 --> 02:44:17.567]  Right, exactly.
[02:44:17.607 --> 02:44:21.990]  And that's why, you know, to me, I just immediately came off myself and said, that's intentional.
[02:44:22.331 --> 02:44:25.193]  And throughout the whole event, even after George said right off the bat.
[02:44:25.213 --> 02:44:27.154]  He was following a formulaic system.
[02:44:27.554 --> 02:44:28.235]  He's a lawyer.
[02:44:28.435 --> 02:44:29.376]  I'm not saying he's a fed.
[02:44:30.236 --> 02:44:31.977]  It just made me suspicious.
[02:44:32.037 --> 02:44:33.538]  More and more it's been revealed.
[02:44:33.838 --> 02:44:35.039]  It just kind of made me suspicious.
[02:44:35.579 --> 02:44:37.160]  But anyway, Alex, you did a terrific job.
[02:44:37.180 --> 02:44:39.721]  The problem they're going to have is they haven't been in training like I have.
[02:44:39.761 --> 02:44:42.962]  You work 15, 18 hours a day for a decade.
[02:44:43.503 --> 02:44:44.023]  That's amazing.
[02:44:44.103 --> 02:44:44.963]  And you live this.
[02:44:45.203 --> 02:44:48.745]  You truly become it.
[02:44:49.886 --> 02:44:50.386]  It's a joke.
[02:44:50.426 --> 02:44:51.006]  Thanks for the call.
[02:44:51.026 --> 02:44:52.827]  Let me tell you what's happening.
[02:44:54.591 --> 02:44:59.714]  Even corrupt people in government that have done little corrupt things, made little money on the side, they're not totally evil.
[02:45:00.835 --> 02:45:03.177]  And they're really saying, man, they're setting up martial law.
[02:45:03.217 --> 02:45:04.517]  Man, we're getting the orders here.
[02:45:04.918 --> 02:45:06.759]  They're really gearing up for forced inoculations.
[02:45:06.779 --> 02:45:08.460]  They're really gearing up to take pension funds.
[02:45:08.900 --> 02:45:11.142]  They're really gearing up to issue national ID cards.
[02:45:11.382 --> 02:45:13.803]  They're really gearing up to draft my daughter and my son.
[02:45:15.384 --> 02:45:19.667]  And people, I mean, even corrupt people in government are finally going, man, this is scary.
[02:45:19.687 --> 02:45:22.169]  I mean, I'm hearing it in their voices.
[02:45:23.755 --> 02:45:28.479]  I mean, it's time to, you know... I'm not going to use that analogy.
[02:45:29.680 --> 02:45:32.343]  You know, do whatever you have to on the pot or get off.
[02:45:32.963 --> 02:45:34.184]  I mean, people know.
[02:45:34.204 --> 02:45:36.086]  This isn't a joke, folks.
[02:45:36.126 --> 02:45:37.467]  Everybody in their guts knows.
[02:45:39.008 --> 02:45:42.191]  I mean, we're either going to turn this around or we're going into something really scary.
[02:45:45.134 --> 02:45:48.197]  You can be part of history on the side of goodness and just ask God for guidance.
[02:45:49.252 --> 02:45:51.273]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in New York.
[02:45:51.313 --> 02:45:51.814]  Go ahead, Mike.
[02:45:52.394 --> 02:45:53.695]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:45:53.755 --> 02:46:01.120]  Just a point of order for the fellow from Kentucky who called in there quibbling over Morgan Reynolds' position.
[02:46:01.460 --> 02:46:06.543]  The UPI article states, former Bush team member.
[02:46:06.563 --> 02:46:11.246]  That's a perfectly legitimate characterization of Mr. Reynolds' position.
[02:46:11.766 --> 02:46:13.147]  It doesn't say cabinet member.
[02:46:13.587 --> 02:46:14.948]  It says team member.
[02:46:15.308 --> 02:46:16.149]  That's acceptable.
[02:46:17.390 --> 02:46:17.490]  Um...
[02:46:18.377 --> 02:46:23.845]  And it says, Former Chief Economist for the Labor Department during George Bush's first term.
[02:46:25.547 --> 02:46:27.648]  Just a weak analysis on his part.
[02:46:27.708 --> 02:46:32.792]  Well, I think he's talking about other articles we posted and things along that nature.
[02:46:32.812 --> 02:46:37.474]  And there is another article that was written where they said he was at A&M currently.
[02:46:37.494 --> 02:46:39.015]  And that's not an article we wrote.
[02:46:39.035 --> 02:46:40.556]  It's an article that's out there on the web.
[02:46:40.576 --> 02:46:42.157]  And I think that's what he was talking about.
[02:46:42.177 --> 02:46:42.397]  Right.
[02:46:42.417 --> 02:46:44.459]  He's a respected professor.
[02:46:44.499 --> 02:46:45.959]  The point is, it doesn't matter.
[02:46:45.979 --> 02:46:47.000]  I mean, exactly.
[02:46:47.200 --> 02:46:47.420]  Yeah.
[02:46:47.640 --> 02:46:49.001]  It's equivalent.
[02:46:49.241 --> 02:46:50.062]  Let me ask you something.
[02:46:53.283 --> 02:46:56.004]  Clearly, I think they're already starting to backpedal.
[02:46:56.024 --> 02:46:58.944]  They realize that this is just blowing up in their faces.
[02:46:59.705 --> 02:47:01.485]  As it always does.
[02:47:01.805 --> 02:47:04.086]  But how dangerous of a moment is this?
[02:47:04.386 --> 02:47:06.426]  I mean, this is what I'm concerned about.
[02:47:06.446 --> 02:47:08.307]  Sure, we can see mushroom clouds next week.
[02:47:08.767 --> 02:47:10.669]  I'm not saying that's going to happen, but anything's possible.
[02:47:10.829 --> 02:47:12.490]  Right, right, right.
[02:47:12.590 --> 02:47:19.256]  Let me ask, I want to hear your thoughts on the growing military stature of China.
[02:47:19.296 --> 02:47:19.836]  I'll let you go.
[02:47:19.896 --> 02:47:20.237]  Thank you.
[02:47:20.477 --> 02:47:20.917]  Thank you.
[02:47:21.498 --> 02:47:23.659]  They are, America's on the chopping block.
[02:47:24.120 --> 02:47:25.641]  Everything's being transferred there.
[02:47:25.701 --> 02:47:26.982]  They get all the UN awards.
[02:47:27.643 --> 02:47:28.363]  They are the model.
[02:47:29.644 --> 02:47:30.405]  We're in decline.
[02:47:31.085 --> 02:47:33.367]  We're in deep trouble.
[02:47:33.427 --> 02:47:34.568]  Let's go ahead.
[02:47:34.628 --> 02:47:35.229]  Who's up next?
[02:47:37.020 --> 02:47:38.221]  John in Arizona, go ahead.
[02:47:38.641 --> 02:47:39.682]  Hey, Alex, how are you?
[02:47:39.802 --> 02:47:40.043]  Good.
[02:47:40.363 --> 02:47:42.405]  You did a great job last night, man.
[02:47:42.485 --> 02:47:43.285]  Kudos to you.
[02:47:44.246 --> 02:47:46.508]  Alex, I want to thank you for fighting the New World Order.
[02:47:46.568 --> 02:47:49.270]  I was just made aware of this about two and a half years ago.
[02:47:49.771 --> 02:47:51.932]  Someone was doing their job and handed me a flyer.
[02:47:52.493 --> 02:47:57.057]  And I'll tell you, Alex, ever since I've woken up to the truth, you are the man, Alex.
[02:47:58.338 --> 02:47:59.679]  Well, frankly, I don't want to be the man.
[02:47:59.719 --> 02:48:01.120]  I don't want to be the number one target.
[02:48:01.300 --> 02:48:04.843]  Well, no, but I'll tell you, I really respect what you're doing.
[02:48:05.502 --> 02:48:11.546]  And, you know, I'm a member of Jack McLam's Police and Military against the New World Order now, because I am former military.
[02:48:12.287 --> 02:48:19.731]  And, you know, it's amazing how many of my military brothers and sisters are waking up here in Phoenix to what's going on.
[02:48:19.891 --> 02:48:23.474]  I daily hand them videos and information on the New World Order.
[02:48:23.494 --> 02:48:25.995]  And they clearly know something's wrong with this country.
[02:48:27.156 --> 02:48:30.738]  Well, yeah, the border's been ordered to stand down, but we've got to give all our rights up?
[02:48:31.219 --> 02:48:31.739]  Exactly.
[02:48:32.700 --> 02:48:33.880]  You're doing a great job, Alex.
[02:48:34.141 --> 02:48:34.501]  Thank you.
[02:48:35.271 --> 02:48:37.152]  Bottom line, you're doing a great job getting the word out.
[02:48:37.632 --> 02:48:41.754]  Bottom line, everybody listening, ask yourselves, you want to give your children into a police state?
[02:48:42.494 --> 02:48:43.335]  I mean, ask yourselves.
[02:48:46.016 --> 02:48:50.378]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.538 --> 02:48:54.980]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:55.120 --> 02:48:59.502]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.542 --> 02:49:00.883]  The New World Order.
[02:49:02.657 --> 02:49:06.880]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.

[02:52:07.243 --> 02:52:11.686]  Before we take these two final calls, though, I want to thank all of you for your support.
[02:52:12.826 --> 02:52:17.929]  It's not just my listeners that are calling in saying we handily, Mr. Griffin and myself, won the debate.
[02:52:18.429 --> 02:52:25.133]  It's literally, I had over 100 emails that I just scanned this morning, and there were like two of them that were negative.
[02:52:25.959 --> 02:52:26.359]  Two of them.
[02:52:27.500 --> 02:52:29.842]  And one of them was from a regular detractor.
[02:52:31.122 --> 02:52:36.506]  And every call on that show was for our view, except for one, and he wasn't sure.
[02:52:37.967 --> 02:52:39.148]  Find out the real truth.
[02:52:39.188 --> 02:52:40.409]  Don't just have part of it.

[02:53:42.455 --> 02:53:43.676]  Will in Virginia, go ahead.
[02:53:43.696 --> 02:53:48.079]  Yes, sir, there's a lot of noise where I'm at, but I heard somebody mention about the Behemian Grove.
[02:53:49.023 --> 02:53:54.724]  I distinctly remember hearing on the radio the AP reports where Chaney and Schwarzenegger were anointed.
[02:53:55.444 --> 02:53:57.785]  So when I get home, I'll try to look that up for you.
[02:53:58.865 --> 02:54:07.587]  Well, I have the San Francisco Chronicle, Sacramento Bee, Associated Press, where they said that they picked Schwarzenegger at Bohemian Grove.
[02:54:07.727 --> 02:54:08.927]  Yeah, I also remember that.
[02:54:08.967 --> 02:54:10.447]  Yeah, I remember that day.
[02:54:11.328 --> 02:54:17.849]  I'm going to email you a tips line about this PETA thing in Norfolk, because I'm in Norfolk, and it may be a way to get you some more exposure here.
[02:54:18.920 --> 02:54:23.224]  I'm trying to get you on the radio here, and I don't think the powers that be at the radio station just don't want to do it.
[02:54:24.525 --> 02:54:25.707]  All right, well, God bless you, sir.
[02:54:26.387 --> 02:54:27.128]  I appreciate that.
[02:54:27.148 --> 02:54:28.870]  Yeah, there are a bunch of sickos over there.
[02:54:28.890 --> 02:54:32.093]  A lot of well-meaning idiots, too, but the leadership's out of control.
[02:54:32.793 --> 02:54:34.795]  Charlie and Mass, last caller, welcome.
[02:54:35.536 --> 02:54:37.558]  Yeah, real quick, Alex, I just have to share this with you.
[02:54:37.658 --> 02:54:41.982]  I was on the Controlled Demolition website, controlled-demolition.com,
[02:54:42.779 --> 02:54:46.160]  And if you click Government, at the top of the screen it says Department of Defense.
[02:54:46.220 --> 02:54:48.361]  I don't know if you saw this before, but it blew me away.
[02:54:48.381 --> 02:54:49.882]  Yeah, I've been on their website.
[02:54:50.102 --> 02:54:50.642]  But listen to this.
[02:54:50.702 --> 02:54:51.342]  I don't know if you saw this.
[02:54:51.462 --> 02:55:05.648]  It says, quote, We have the appropriate experience and expertise to assist DOD agencies and contractors in demolition operations on, get this, sensitive projects domestically and internationally.
[02:55:06.788 --> 02:55:11.370]  It actually says we specialize in sensitive... And they're the guys that hold off the rubble
[02:55:12.667 --> 02:55:18.390]  While Congress was trying to block them, and they're the guys that blew up the remains of the Oklahoma City... Oklahoma City, sure.
[02:55:18.730 --> 02:55:19.510]  Yeah.
[02:55:19.550 --> 02:55:23.152]  But they actually say, we specialize in sensitive... What else could that mean?
[02:55:23.172 --> 02:55:26.534]  They're telling you right out, we specialize in sensitive projects.
[02:55:27.554 --> 02:55:28.695]  I couldn't believe it!
[02:55:29.855 --> 02:55:32.516]  So, you know, tell your listeners, go out and check it out for yourself.
[02:55:33.157 --> 02:55:33.537]  Controls.
[02:55:35.504 --> 02:55:37.365]  Yeah, controlleddemolition, what is it, .com?
[02:55:37.385 --> 02:55:39.226]  It's controlled-demolition.com.
[02:55:39.246 --> 02:55:41.387]  Yeah, and it's got all the buildings they've blown up, too.
[02:55:41.407 --> 02:55:43.428]  You can watch video clips of it.
[02:55:43.708 --> 02:55:44.809]  Yeah, unbelievable.
[02:55:44.869 --> 02:55:46.550]  All right, brother.
[02:55:46.910 --> 02:55:47.450]  Yeah, thank you.
[02:55:47.690 --> 02:55:48.471]  I appreciate you.
[02:55:48.511 --> 02:55:49.511]  Sorry we're out of time.
[02:55:50.552 --> 02:55:54.534]  I'm going to go hit the sack with extreme pleasure.
[02:55:54.634 --> 02:55:58.876]  Climb into that air-conditioned room, pull those covers up over me, and ah!
[02:56:00.396 --> 02:56:01.357]  Got a few hours.
[02:56:02.497 --> 02:56:03.398]  A few weeks.
[02:56:05.863 --> 02:56:14.405]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight central, and of course, back on Monday, and I want to thank all the affiliates, all the sponsors, all the listeners, the great folks that run the broadcast, my producers, everybody!
[02:56:14.565 --> 02:56:20.646]  Thanks for all your support, standing up for human liberty and dignity, resisting dehumanization and the forces of death.
