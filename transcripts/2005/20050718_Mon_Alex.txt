[00:00:05.633 --> 00:00:06.294]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.954 --> 00:00:08.015]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.716 --> 00:00:09.837]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.498 --> 00:00:11.278]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:12.840]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.642]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.802 --> 00:00:21.946]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.031 --> 00:00:37.118]  Alright my friends, another live edition.
[00:00:37.198 --> 00:00:38.559]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:39.929 --> 00:01:00.104]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours as we seek the truth, as we expose the globalists, the overlords, the social architects, the cold, calculating engineers of our society who are hungrily dehumanizing us and rebuilding the world, remaking the world in their dark image.
[00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.988]  We're going to have wide open phones today.
[00:01:04.008 --> 00:01:06.651]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:06.671 --> 00:01:06.731]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:06.751 --> 00:01:12.036]  And you are welcome to call in on any issue, any news item, anything you wish to discuss, all these new...
[00:01:25.828 --> 00:01:32.873]  Developments with the London bombing, the media doling out the still images from the surveillance cameras.
[00:01:33.613 --> 00:01:36.155]  Oh, look at them smiling and having fun.
[00:01:36.175 --> 00:01:43.840]  How all of this ties in with their past operations of using patsies and basically setting them up.
[00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:47.102]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:47.122 --> 00:01:47.462]  At the same time...
[00:01:53.692 --> 00:02:03.454]  We have some of the aftershocks of the top Chinese general on Thursday giving a press conference saying we'll destroy 200 U.S.
[00:02:03.714 --> 00:02:04.154]  cities.
[00:02:04.214 --> 00:02:09.936]  And I thought we'd go back and look at PDD 60, Presidential Decision Directive 60.
[00:02:10.376 --> 00:02:20.358]  I have a copy of it printed off here in my hands, and I told my webmaster to post it, and it should be posted here in the next few minutes up on Prison Planet.
[00:02:22.618 --> 00:02:32.243]  I specifically told the webmaster for InfoWars.com to post it.
[00:02:35.144 --> 00:02:36.144]  Here's some of the news.
[00:02:36.224 --> 00:02:41.847]  British media again tentatively questions official line on bombings.
[00:02:43.684 --> 00:02:53.727]  Here's the headline, the Reconstruction 7-7, what really happened, and now even several mainstream British publications are questioning the official story.
[00:02:55.588 --> 00:02:59.950]  Meanwhile, the British government is saying terror hunt could take decades.
[00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.570]  Well, at least it's not like Bush said.
[00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:09.953]  It's a hundred-year war, never-ending foggy enemy that can never be defeated, so give up all of your liberties and freedoms.
[00:03:11.233 --> 00:03:13.114]  No, the British are just saying decades.
[00:03:14.091 --> 00:03:25.475]  And more and more is now being made of the London Transportation Secretary, who's a former CIA officer and of course helped run some of the cover-ups on 9-11.
[00:03:26.155 --> 00:03:28.116]  That's the fellow we have running things.
[00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.740]  We talked about this last week, but new developments have come out.
[00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.640]  We'll be going over that.
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:44.322]  By the way, today is the two-year anniversary of Dr. David Kelly, the Porton Down bioweapons expert, also an Iraq weapons inspector for the United Nations.
[00:03:46.022 --> 00:03:58.465]  About a month before he was killed, he told two different colleagues, one in London, one in Los Alamos, New Mexico, they're going to kill me
[00:04:00.416 --> 00:04:04.980]  And they're going to put me in the woods and say it was a suicide.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.822]  Now that's on record.
[00:04:07.803 --> 00:04:13.368]  It's like Diana said there, Charles says he's going to kill me and it's going to look like an auto accident.
[00:04:14.208 --> 00:04:18.352]  And then it happens and, oh no, Charles isn't a suspect.
[00:04:18.853 --> 00:04:19.794]  Everything's fine.
[00:04:21.175 --> 00:04:23.417]  So we'll go over that as well.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.464]  And more news on aspartame and fluoride is coming out.
[00:04:28.884 --> 00:04:32.187]  Just how deadly both of these substances are.
[00:04:32.267 --> 00:04:35.670]  And the mainstream media is trying to spin it desperately.
[00:04:38.432 --> 00:04:42.556]  All this and a lot more coming up after this quick break.
[00:04:43.417 --> 00:04:44.538]  We'll be going to your calls.
[00:04:45.274 --> 00:04:46.756]  Early in this hour.
[00:04:46.796 --> 00:04:48.498]  In fact, I'll go to them in the next segment.
[00:04:49.138 --> 00:04:56.286]  Any issue, any angle, anything you want to cover, I love the directions, the different directions the callers take us in.
[00:04:56.346 --> 00:04:56.627]  So, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:05:02.353 --> 00:05:02.793]  We're good to go.
[00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:29.251]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.451 --> 00:05:33.872]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.092 --> 00:05:41.314]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.574 --> 00:05:44.014]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:05:44.155 --> 00:05:45.895]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[00:06:01.633 --> 00:06:04.514]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:06:04.854 --> 00:06:07.714]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:06:07.954 --> 00:06:14.176]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:06:14.536 --> 00:06:21.837]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[00:06:22.017 --> 00:06:26.018]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophe.
[00:06:26.398 --> 00:06:31.922]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.
[00:06:32.123 --> 00:06:45.252]  Complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on each of the 3,000-plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution, full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis that you need.

[00:07:01.681 --> 00:07:04.522]  Let's face it, we know that we're less than perfect when it comes to our diets.
[00:07:04.602 --> 00:07:09.684]  We all eat sugar, saturated fats, salt, probably don't get the exercise we should and we all have to deal with daily stress.
[00:07:09.904 --> 00:07:16.066]  And all the vitamins and supplements in the world won't help you if your immune system is compromised because of our less than perfect eating habits and lifestyles.
[00:07:16.346 --> 00:07:21.988]  That's why Agaricus Bio is the number one dietary supplement that you should consider an absolute must if you're going to take any at all.
[00:07:22.248 --> 00:07:27.769]  The immune system is your body's first line of defense against disease, and Agaricus Bio strengthens and supports your immune system.
[00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:31.830]  That's why it's become the most popular immune support system for people and pets in Japan.
[00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:38.131]  A one-month supply of Agaricus Bio is only $34.95, and that's a small price to pay considering the alternatives.
[00:07:38.151 --> 00:07:39.272]  Call 877-817-9829.
[00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:43.712]  That's 877-817-9829, or visit thepowermall.com.
[00:07:43.732 --> 00:07:48.333]  How many times have you heard about people taking vitamin C and other vitamins and supplements to fight a cold?
[00:07:48.533 --> 00:07:51.374]  Well, with Agaricus Bio, you might not catch that cold in the first place.
[00:07:51.374 --> 00:07:51.955]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.131 --> 00:08:08.211]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.912 --> 00:08:10.012]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.672 --> 00:08:11.492]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.232 --> 00:08:13.113]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.133 --> 00:08:17.474]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.974 --> 00:08:22.055]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:35.901 --> 00:08:39.563]  Here's the headline out of Ireland today.
[00:08:40.564 --> 00:08:43.386]  Israel on the brink of Gaza invasion.
[00:08:43.546 --> 00:08:46.368]  Israel today threatened to invade Gaza.
[00:08:46.428 --> 00:08:58.136]  A Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, does not control militants who have stepped up rocket and mortar attacks ahead of Israel's pullout from the territory next month.
[00:08:59.657 --> 00:09:00.858]  Now just stop right there.
[00:09:02.296 --> 00:09:29.558]  Why magically, right when there's about to be peace, and right when the roadmap of peace is about to be basically confirmed and supported, a big move towards peace, are these supposed Hezbollah and Hamas militants firing these ineffective...
[00:09:30.334 --> 00:09:33.477]  Rockets out into the no man's land.
[00:09:33.977 --> 00:09:40.283]  Literally exploding them on the sides of sand dunes and rock outcroppings.
[00:09:42.725 --> 00:09:48.429]  Do you really think that Egypt that gets $4 billion a year from the U.S.
[00:09:48.449 --> 00:09:50.051]  wants the fighting to stop?
[00:09:50.651 --> 00:09:57.497]  Do you think Israel that gets $5 to $8 billion depending on what year from the United States wants the fighting to stop?
[00:09:58.433 --> 00:10:01.635]  Do you think the globalists want the fighting to stop?
[00:10:04.578 --> 00:10:08.380]  Israel admittedly founded Hamas in 1973.
[00:10:08.861 --> 00:10:14.024]  That is Haratz, UPI, Jerusalem Post.
[00:10:15.125 --> 00:10:24.012]  The late Israeli Prime Minister gave a speech at one of the major Jewish universities in Tel Aviv and admitted that they founded Hamas.
[00:10:25.754 --> 00:10:30.917]  To radicalize the Palestinians, to radicalize the Muslims.
[00:10:31.277 --> 00:10:34.599]  Their claim is it makes them more easily to control.
[00:10:35.039 --> 00:10:45.764]  Because if you've got mainstream peaceful people having smart bombs dropped on them every day, the world opinion will be against the country that's doing it.
[00:10:45.824 --> 00:10:49.006]  But if you control a group of terrorists...
[00:10:50.276 --> 00:11:06.863]  Who themselves then have useful idiots who work for them, who really think they're fighting some jihad, then you have a perfect recipe to wage war against that population and then have the images for the newscast to say, look, we're just defending ourselves.
[00:11:09.484 --> 00:11:14.746]  And I'm not a big fan of the Iranian government, but compared to our government, you know, there's Stone Age corruption.
[00:11:16.238 --> 00:11:20.402]  And they've come out and said that they believe Israel is behind these current attacks.
[00:11:20.962 --> 00:11:21.803]  And I agree with it.
[00:11:21.863 --> 00:11:23.185]  The past MO shows it.
[00:11:24.246 --> 00:11:30.351]  Iran came out and tried to blame Israel day one for the bombings in London.
[00:11:30.451 --> 00:11:31.512]  I didn't agree with that.
[00:11:31.993 --> 00:11:37.858]  I do agree with one of their senior ruling council members who is now saying he doesn't think it's Israel.
[00:11:38.238 --> 00:11:39.880]  He thinks it's the British government.
[00:11:40.845 --> 00:11:42.406]  And he said, just look at the motive.
[00:11:42.466 --> 00:11:45.308]  Look at how they framed Patsy's in the past.
[00:11:45.349 --> 00:11:48.391]  Look at how the British government's been caught doing this before.
[00:11:48.751 --> 00:11:51.693]  Which, by the way, they have been caught doing it before.
[00:11:51.773 --> 00:11:53.675]  And now Blair's approval ratings are up.
[00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:55.756]  Bush's approval ratings are up.
[00:11:56.097 --> 00:11:57.618]  We have to look at the evidence.
[00:11:59.419 --> 00:12:01.621]  I know I repeat this a lot, but it's so important.
[00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:13.348]  We have caught the Israelis carrying out terror before in their own country to blame it on their enemies and to bolster support for the military government.
[00:12:15.149 --> 00:12:20.191]  We have caught the British government multiple times red-handed.
[00:12:20.271 --> 00:12:21.812]  It is publicly admitted.
[00:12:22.132 --> 00:12:24.093]  You understand it is not debated.
[00:12:24.274 --> 00:12:28.756]  It is admitted that the British government has carried out terror against itself.
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.101]  It is not debatable.
[00:12:31.181 --> 00:12:31.901]  It is admitted.
[00:12:31.961 --> 00:12:32.562]  The U.S.
[00:12:32.622 --> 00:12:38.566]  government has carried out terror against itself and planned to carry out terror against itself.
[00:12:39.046 --> 00:12:40.067]  That is admitted.
[00:12:40.167 --> 00:12:55.357]  So every time there's an attack, we look at who has the motive, then we look at who has said they want to carry out attacks, we look at who has been caught carrying out attacks, and then we look at the evidence, the probability that lone bombers did this.
[00:12:56.598 --> 00:12:57.619]  And it's impossible.
[00:13:01.275 --> 00:13:03.679]  So, Israel on the brink of Gaza invasion.
[00:13:03.699 --> 00:13:08.565]  EU may be ready to help Iran build nuclear reactors, negotiator says.
[00:13:08.605 --> 00:13:10.929]  This is out of the French news agency.
[00:13:11.983 --> 00:13:13.464]  We're good to go.
[00:13:13.524 --> 00:13:13.824]  I think?
[00:13:32.635 --> 00:13:42.541]  And aimed at resolving the crisis could include such an offer as well as several month delay before Iran's nuclear ambitions are referred to the UN Security Council.
[00:13:45.522 --> 00:13:48.364]  The London Independent is now asking questions.
[00:13:48.424 --> 00:13:51.606]  The London Mirror is now asking questions about the official story.
[00:13:53.367 --> 00:13:57.269]  And I have several articles I do want to go over that cover that.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:05.786]  Egypt is saying they will not hand over the supposed biochemist who they're trying to claim built the bombs.
[00:14:06.186 --> 00:14:09.008]  First they said it was super-grade military.
[00:14:09.028 --> 00:14:12.490]  Now they've changed that story.
[00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:17.114]  So that's just some of the news.
[00:14:18.014 --> 00:14:27.101]  Some of the things that are on the back burner that we should all be aware of is that the EU is still steaming straight ahead...
[00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:34.994]  Despite the fact that the French and the Dutch and others have thrown some large icebergs in their way.
[00:14:36.815 --> 00:14:41.937]  The globalists are literally just saying, damn the torpedoes, go straight at them.
[00:14:42.598 --> 00:14:43.538]  Ramming speed.
[00:14:44.078 --> 00:14:47.720]  It's full steam ahead for the EU Constitution, even after no votes.
[00:14:52.119 --> 00:15:03.808]  You may have gotten the impression that the European Constitution was dead, that the French had felled it, and the Dutch had pounded a stake through its heart.
[00:15:04.309 --> 00:15:05.490]  If so, think again.
[00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:13.076]  The Constitution is being implemented, clause by clause, as if the no votes had not happened.
[00:15:13.937 --> 00:15:15.298]  And this is the London Telegraph.
[00:15:15.838 --> 00:15:18.100]  This is exactly what we've always talked about.
[00:15:19.807 --> 00:15:35.498]  Ronald Reagan pulls us out of UNESCO, which is a United Nations agency, multifaceted agency, the United Nations Educational and Cultural Organization.
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:48.688]  And Ronald Reagan pulled us out of it, but then federal agencies simply had their regulators write up
[00:15:49.546 --> 00:15:52.088]  Policies that mirrored the treaty.
[00:15:53.209 --> 00:15:56.271]  So what our government does is they sign a treaty with the UN.
[00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:05.959]  And then, through that treaty agreement and that treaty organization, they implement the program.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:17.908]  Ronald Reagan pulls us out of it, a treaty that regulated our education, our land use, just university funding...
[00:16:19.497 --> 00:16:24.179]  How education is basically structured.
[00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:26.280]  Everything.
[00:16:26.821 --> 00:16:28.562]  Local zoning laws, you name it.
[00:16:30.403 --> 00:16:42.609]  And when Reagan pulled out of it, the agency simply followed the original agreements of the treaties, and then Bush signed back onto it two years ago, and none of it ever really meant anything.
[00:16:43.909 --> 00:16:45.070]  Well, it's the same thing here.
[00:16:45.859 --> 00:16:58.843]  People get angry in Europe about giving up the last vestiges of their sovereignty, giving up private property rights, giving up free speech, all these new taxing mechanisms and regulatory agencies.
[00:17:00.584 --> 00:17:05.465]  And so their governments just continue to follow the treaty agreement.
[00:17:07.106 --> 00:17:10.867]  And we will go over some of that a little bit later as well.
[00:17:10.947 --> 00:17:13.848]  It's pretty scary, pretty scary stuff.
[00:17:14.582 --> 00:17:17.463]  Right now, though, let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[00:17:19.263 --> 00:17:23.505]  Let's go ahead and talk to... Who should I go to first?
[00:17:24.925 --> 00:17:25.926]  Patrick in Maryland.
[00:17:25.946 --> 00:17:26.806]  Go ahead, Patrick.
[00:17:27.246 --> 00:17:27.666]  Hi, Alex.
[00:17:28.086 --> 00:17:28.466]  Hi.
[00:17:28.686 --> 00:17:29.867]  I have several observations.
[00:17:30.427 --> 00:17:33.488]  First, you have often spoken of the Bush-Clinton low-fest.
[00:17:34.188 --> 00:17:37.069]  I believe that the worst fallout from this Bush-Clinton merger...
[00:17:37.739 --> 00:17:47.508]  Is that government atrocities like Ruby Ridge, Waco, Oklahoma City, and 9-11 will never be carefully, completely, openly, and thoroughly investigated by the government.
[00:17:48.069 --> 00:17:55.256]  Only concerned and really vigorous citizens and small groups will keep on investigating these atrocities.
[00:17:55.276 --> 00:17:55.836]  Do you agree?
[00:17:56.757 --> 00:18:00.621]  Well, I mean, there's no need to really investigate Ruby Ridge or Waco anymore.
[00:18:00.681 --> 00:18:01.942]  We know those were government ops.
[00:18:02.697 --> 00:18:11.762]  We need to continue to educate on 9-11 and investigate, building our voluminous ironclad case, just strengthening it, if that's even possible.
[00:18:12.463 --> 00:18:15.585]  I mean, already it's like there's too much evidence to even put on a case.
[00:18:15.705 --> 00:18:19.407]  It's just like trying to describe the night sky to somebody.
[00:18:19.427 --> 00:18:21.068]  There are just so many areas.
[00:18:21.148 --> 00:18:30.033]  But, yeah, the first thing George Bush did when he got into office was tell Dan Burton and other members of Congress and other committees, leave Bill Clinton alone.
[00:18:31.648 --> 00:18:32.628]  Kind of like the song.
[00:18:33.448 --> 00:18:36.609]  And, you know, Leave me, Clinton, alone.
[00:18:36.629 --> 00:18:46.471]  And so all those pardons of people selling out secrets to Chinese generals and cocaine dealers in the White House, so what?
[00:18:46.511 --> 00:18:47.351]  That's just our government.
[00:18:48.831 --> 00:18:49.771]  Okay, the next thing here.
[00:18:50.231 --> 00:18:51.552]  I've been giving a lot of thought to this.
[00:18:52.092 --> 00:19:00.113]  I believe concerned people should be giving some really serious consideration to getting out of large and even medium-sized cities before martial law is imposed.
[00:19:00.492 --> 00:19:01.313]  I mean, look at it this way.
[00:19:01.813 --> 00:19:06.276]  Martial law will be bad all over America, but I think it will be especially bad in cities.
[00:19:06.337 --> 00:19:13.482]  Major cities under martial law will be real hellholes, especially during the summer heat with possible power failures, you know, and trigger happy troops.
[00:19:13.982 --> 00:19:14.543]  Your opinion?
[00:19:16.084 --> 00:19:17.705]  Well, I think it is advisable.
[00:19:18.706 --> 00:19:25.131]  I live in a city, and I do that because, you know, I can better fight the globalists from here.
[00:19:25.932 --> 00:19:28.934]  But you're absolutely right that...
[00:19:31.078 --> 00:19:33.499]  Look, it's just better living in the country, period.
[00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.640]  And we need more people in the country.
[00:19:37.421 --> 00:19:40.322]  We're about, what, 85% urbanized now.
[00:19:40.382 --> 00:19:44.544]  That is about 85% of our population lives in the cities.
[00:19:45.344 --> 00:19:47.505]  And that's never good for a free society.
[00:19:47.565 --> 00:19:57.149]  Thomas Jefferson believed the backbone of a free society would be a powerful but educated and heavily armed agrarian backbone.
[00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:58.330]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:01.186 --> 00:20:02.106]  We're good to go.
[00:20:21.834 --> 00:20:22.274]  We're good to go.
[00:20:40.586 --> 00:20:44.588]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:21:04.756 --> 00:21:08.238]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:21:08.338 --> 00:21:12.280]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:18.663]  Black Berkey replacement elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:21:19.064 --> 00:21:26.988]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:21:27.408 --> 00:21:32.750]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:36.672]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:21:37.032 --> 00:21:38.933]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[00:21:38.953 --> 00:21:41.114]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:21:41.354 --> 00:21:46.296]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:21:46.336 --> 00:21:50.458]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:21:53.439 --> 00:21:54.824]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:21:55.044 --> 00:21:56.950]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[00:22:00.936 --> 00:22:03.157]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[00:22:03.577 --> 00:22:07.938]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[00:22:08.218 --> 00:22:14.000]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:18.302]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[00:22:18.582 --> 00:22:24.224]  However, they have become the elite group more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[00:22:24.344 --> 00:22:26.964]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[00:22:29.065 --> 00:22:32.967]  By mid-1983, it was close to $500 amounts.
[00:22:33.007 --> 00:22:35.387]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[00:22:35.728 --> 00:22:38.028]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[00:22:38.409 --> 00:22:42.050]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:48.713]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[00:22:49.153 --> 00:22:50.153]  You'll be glad you did.
[00:22:50.473 --> 00:22:50.793]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:50.813 --> 00:22:50.993]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.

[00:23:52.899 --> 00:23:54.380]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.121]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:14.831 --> 00:24:17.172]  All right, I'm going to go back to your calls right now.
[00:24:17.672 --> 00:24:29.174]  Coming up in the next segment, I've got a couple different news clips I want to play and basically dissect and critique just to get a flavor of where the propaganda is going.
[00:24:30.714 --> 00:24:37.235]  There have been a lot of new things that have come out concerning the London bombings of now a week and a half ago.
[00:24:38.016 --> 00:24:39.916]  We'll be going over those as well.
[00:24:41.198 --> 00:24:50.305]  But I do want to spend a few minutes on how the EU was rebuked by the people of Europe, but their own governments are still just going ahead with it.
[00:24:51.726 --> 00:24:56.129]  You know, it's like we say we don't want light rail in Austin, Texas.
[00:24:56.170 --> 00:25:02.434]  So they start building the bus stops, the train stops, the different facilities.
[00:25:03.275 --> 00:25:04.896]  We say we don't want toll roads.
[00:25:05.457 --> 00:25:07.118]  They start building them ten years ago.
[00:25:08.266 --> 00:25:11.028]  They tell you about it after they've already done it.
[00:25:11.989 --> 00:25:15.752]  And it just shows the tyranny of these elites.
[00:25:16.413 --> 00:25:21.297]  Right now, let's go ahead and go to Rodney in Texas and Michael, Clifford, Chris, and others.
[00:25:21.597 --> 00:25:22.898]  Go ahead, Rodney.
[00:25:22.978 --> 00:25:23.939]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[00:25:23.999 --> 00:25:25.500]  It's a wonderful show, as usual.
[00:25:26.101 --> 00:25:31.305]  And I appreciate being able to start the week off with enlightening news.
[00:25:31.926 --> 00:25:36.950]  I've been to your website this morning, and I noticed that there are three stories that kind of caught my interest.
[00:25:37.971 --> 00:25:51.681]  Of course, the story with the military basically finding itself innocent of the abuses that took place over there in Abu Ghraib.
[00:25:52.162 --> 00:25:53.402]  I'm glad you mentioned this.
[00:25:53.503 --> 00:26:04.971]  Last Friday, the Army came out and said, making people say they're a dog, putting a leash on them, making them wear women's panties, playing loud music, not letting them sleep,
[00:26:05.914 --> 00:26:07.135]  That's not torture.
[00:26:07.716 --> 00:26:10.719]  Well, folks, if that isn't torture, I don't know what is.
[00:26:11.519 --> 00:26:15.023]  And the point is, sleep deprivation is one of the worst forms.
[00:26:15.083 --> 00:26:25.573]  Now, understand, all they're doing with Camp X-Ray, and that's the specific ruling, of course, is what's happening in Cuba.
[00:26:27.583 --> 00:26:27.783]  Right.
[00:26:28.043 --> 00:26:29.104]  You know, like...
[00:26:49.401 --> 00:26:54.783]  Showing somebody a bomb or a dummy bomb and saying, what is this?
[00:26:55.303 --> 00:26:58.044]  You go, a bomb, and they go, no, it's a cat.
[00:26:58.944 --> 00:27:01.425]  They're also trying to make the people think they're crazy.
[00:27:01.665 --> 00:27:01.925]  Right.
[00:27:02.926 --> 00:27:09.268]  Now, last week you had a story at your website that I found very interesting talking about how the
[00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:13.396]  Yeah, that's admitted.
[00:27:14.857 --> 00:27:23.339]  And then that itself came from copper green developed during the 1960s.
[00:27:23.879 --> 00:27:34.503]  Look, look, if anybody is wondering, if they really tortured, the Attorney General's own memos, when he was the chief legal advisor to Bush, say...
[00:27:36.463 --> 00:27:37.564]  It is not torture.
[00:27:38.244 --> 00:27:39.826]  If we kill people, it's not.
[00:27:40.306 --> 00:27:45.710]  So what they're saying is it's not torture because we've changed the name.
[00:27:48.152 --> 00:27:49.053]  And the definition.
[00:27:50.654 --> 00:27:51.715]  Well, yeah, that's all they've done.
[00:27:51.735 --> 00:27:52.956]  I mean, it's like saying...
[00:27:54.574 --> 00:27:56.834]  Well, look, they do this over and over again.
[00:27:57.175 --> 00:28:02.056]  You know, they focus on, was the Koran flushed down the toilet, or was it thrown in the toilet?
[00:28:02.116 --> 00:28:05.836]  Okay, it was thrown in the toilet, it wasn't flushed down the toilet, that's a misprint.
[00:28:06.096 --> 00:28:06.316]  Right.
[00:28:06.737 --> 00:28:12.798]  You know, they focus on, is Richard Clark an evil liberal for saying they want to do attack Iraq day one?
[00:28:13.018 --> 00:28:16.999]  Well, we have Dick Cheney saying it a year before he got into office.
[00:28:17.039 --> 00:28:22.200]  See, they never get us to focus in on the parts of the debate that can't be debated.
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:23.200]  Just pity stuff.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:27.781]  They get us diverted into fake arguments that they've already set up.
[00:28:28.001 --> 00:28:28.221]  Right.
[00:28:28.301 --> 00:28:35.102]  Now, here's another story, Alex, and I hate to jump around, but I know your time is very valuable.
[00:28:35.782 --> 00:28:50.185]  The inconsistencies with the line on the bombings over there in London, and the thing that I don't hear any of the mainstreams talking about, but I found on your website once again, was the...
[00:28:51.775 --> 00:29:06.044]  Return tickets that these young terrorists supposedly had, but the line that the MI5 or whoever the security agency is over there in Britain, it's very, very inconsistent.
[00:29:06.084 --> 00:29:07.685]  Yeah, Scotland Yard MI5.
[00:29:07.805 --> 00:29:14.169]  Yeah, if you could kind of speak about that for a moment, and then I'm going to hang up, and there's one last story I'd like for you to touch on.
[00:29:15.404 --> 00:29:28.571]  Once again, we have this ugly thing with the tasers down there in Phoenix, rearing its ugly head, and we've got a civil liberties group starting to become... Rodney, every day somebody dies.
[00:29:29.472 --> 00:29:30.112]  Absolutely.
[00:29:30.812 --> 00:29:33.574]  So if you could speak about that after the break, I'd appreciate it.
[00:29:33.634 --> 00:29:35.055]  I hang up and give up the good work.
[00:29:35.395 --> 00:29:35.675]  Sure.
[00:29:35.755 --> 00:29:38.296]  Well, I mean, taser is increasing the power.
[00:29:38.356 --> 00:29:39.117]  That's your answer.
[00:29:39.833 --> 00:29:41.455]  What do I say to a death every day?
[00:29:41.495 --> 00:29:42.276]  Sometimes two?
[00:29:42.956 --> 00:29:44.338]  Increase the power.
[00:29:44.418 --> 00:29:45.098]  What else?
[00:29:45.759 --> 00:29:46.840]  Kill more people.
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.081]  That's the answer.
[00:29:51.785 --> 00:29:52.706]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.186 --> 00:29:54.808]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.689 --> 00:29:58.392]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.463 --> 00:30:03.144]  Soon, the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[00:30:03.364 --> 00:30:05.365]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[00:30:05.565 --> 00:30:06.246]  Prepare yourself.
[00:30:06.426 --> 00:30:10.128]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.
[00:30:10.268 --> 00:30:16.011]  Call toll-free 888-211-1715 and receive the book The Bible Says for free.
[00:30:16.051 --> 00:30:17.452]  There is absolutely no obligation.
[00:30:17.612 --> 00:30:20.233]  No one will call you and your number will not be sold to telemarketers.
[00:30:20.373 --> 00:30:21.934]  We just want to make sure you know the truth.
[00:30:22.174 --> 00:30:25.036]  Get your free book, The Bible Says, by calling toll-free 888-211-1715.
[00:30:25.076 --> 00:30:25.816]  Again, that's 888-211-1715.
[00:30:31.099 --> 00:30:34.700]  Want to know the secret to finding a shop that can keep your car running like new?
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:38.782]  Find the cleanest shop in town, where cleaning is top priority.
[00:30:38.942 --> 00:30:42.443]  Not talking about clean floors, but better shops have those too.
[00:30:42.823 --> 00:30:50.386]  I mean shops that have the best training, equipment, and chemistry to clean every air, fuel, and fluid system in your vehicle.
[00:30:50.686 --> 00:30:53.967]  Keep it clean, and you don't have to keep replacing parts.
[00:30:54.387 --> 00:30:58.048]  Find your clean shop at bgfindashop.com.
[00:30:58.288 --> 00:31:00.109]  That's bgfindashop.com.
[00:31:01.149 --> 00:31:09.411]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:09.671 --> 00:31:14.032]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.313 --> 00:31:23.235]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:23.435 --> 00:31:27.056]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:31:27.356 --> 00:31:32.399]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:39.424]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:31:39.904 --> 00:31:40.445]  What about you?
[00:31:41.195 --> 00:31:46.558]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[00:31:46.598 --> 00:31:47.758]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:31:47.778 --> 00:31:49.659]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:32:01.608 --> 00:32:08.513]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[00:32:09.033 --> 00:32:14.436]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now is the time to start using patented Nonex Nail Gel.
[00:32:14.857 --> 00:32:24.863]  All-natural Nonex is a topical, ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[00:32:25.003 --> 00:32:27.325]  Nonex Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[00:32:27.345 --> 00:32:30.767]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[00:32:31.227 --> 00:32:32.408]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[00:32:32.528 --> 00:32:40.032]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[00:32:40.293 --> 00:32:42.034]  It's also money-back guarantee.
[00:32:42.354 --> 00:32:54.121]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, and independent pharmacies nationwide, or online at drugstore.com.
[00:32:54.621 --> 00:32:58.964]  Non-X Nail Gel, for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[00:33:06.665 --> 00:33:18.832]  Masses of vital news and information, and of course the news behind the news, uncovering the news, crashing through the lies and disinformation, Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[00:33:19.413 --> 00:33:23.435]  Michael and Clifford and Chris and Matt and many others, your calls are coming up.
[00:33:23.475 --> 00:33:24.656]  Toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:29.204 --> 00:33:35.269]  If you're just joining us for the first time as you drive along in, say, Ohio or in central Texas...
[00:33:36.033 --> 00:33:39.515]  Listening to broadcasts, you're like, what is this guy saying?
[00:33:39.935 --> 00:33:40.996]  What is he getting at?
[00:33:41.056 --> 00:33:42.517]  What is this show all about?
[00:33:42.597 --> 00:33:44.018]  Is he a liberal?
[00:33:44.118 --> 00:33:45.178]  Is he a conservative?
[00:33:45.618 --> 00:33:54.744]  You know, I hear him criticize Bush, but then at the same time, he says he's pro-Second Amendment and that Bill Clinton works with the Bushes?
[00:33:55.224 --> 00:33:55.684]  Huh?
[00:33:56.004 --> 00:33:57.285]  That doesn't make any sense.
[00:33:57.305 --> 00:33:59.346]  That's not what I've been taught my whole life.
[00:34:00.287 --> 00:34:02.568]  Well, what you've been taught your whole life is a fraud.
[00:34:03.553 --> 00:34:07.595]  You may be a member of the public who believes that WWF wrestling is real.
[00:34:08.315 --> 00:34:14.217]  Well, I'm that type of party pooper that's here to tell you it's not real.
[00:34:15.718 --> 00:34:18.019]  Look, I don't care about what a politician says.
[00:34:18.799 --> 00:34:21.420]  I look at what they do, what their actions are.
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:26.842]  I look at the patterns of their activities, what governments have done in history, and what they do today.
[00:34:28.129 --> 00:34:32.510]  And let me tell you, the more things change, the more they stay the same, as the cliche goes.
[00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:35.011]  And let me pile another cliche on that one.
[00:34:35.771 --> 00:34:39.313]  Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[00:34:39.753 --> 00:34:40.773]  That's the exact quote.
[00:34:42.494 --> 00:34:53.517]  And I know our founding fathers warned us not to trust government, not to let centralized control basically be set up, to keep gridlocked, to have separation of powers.
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:35:15.204]  But today, we've been taught that government's good, give up all your rights, centralization of control is good, let's get rid of county sheriffs, let's basically federalize the states, let's federalize the cities, let's leave the borders wide open, let's have gun control, let's sign on to all these international treaties, let's sign on to trade deals that get rid of our sovereignty.
[00:35:16.825 --> 00:35:18.405]  I'm against that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:21.205 --> 00:35:23.946]  And so, use whatever label you want
[00:35:25.649 --> 00:35:26.569]  I'm not a liberal.
[00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:27.810]  I'm not a conservative.
[00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:29.031]  I'm a truth seeker.
[00:35:29.451 --> 00:35:30.571]  I'm a freedom lover.
[00:35:30.991 --> 00:35:32.072]  And I love God.
[00:35:32.712 --> 00:35:35.233]  Whatever label you want to put on that, go ahead.
[00:35:36.034 --> 00:35:37.814]  But labels are killing us.
[00:35:40.956 --> 00:35:42.957]  And you know 9-11 is a fraud.
[00:35:42.997 --> 00:35:46.738]  You know in your guts that the official story is a fraud.
[00:35:47.158 --> 00:35:49.520]  You may have been hiding under a rock somewhere.
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:54.962]  You still know instinctively that you've been lied to.
[00:35:55.606 --> 00:35:57.489]  You've seen bits and pieces.
[00:35:57.549 --> 00:36:00.594]  You know that first they claimed that they didn't have any prior knowledge.
[00:36:01.315 --> 00:36:03.879]  Then it came out that the government had total prior knowledge.
[00:36:04.457 --> 00:36:06.698]  Then you heard that Bush was connected to Bin Laden.
[00:36:07.059 --> 00:36:09.560]  That got laughed off, but then later it got admitted.
[00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:11.121]  Oh, but it's just a coincidence.
[00:36:11.722 --> 00:36:13.663]  Oh, they flew the Bin Ladens out to safety.
[00:36:14.163 --> 00:36:15.824]  Oh, they did some insider trading.
[00:36:16.324 --> 00:36:17.765]  Oh, NORAD stood down.
[00:36:18.065 --> 00:36:22.628]  Oh, they were running drills of flying planes into the very buildings at the very times they were hit.
[00:36:22.989 --> 00:36:24.349]  But oh, it's a coincidence.
[00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:26.531]  You know, men in caves.
[00:36:27.131 --> 00:36:28.232]  They did all that.
[00:36:28.672 --> 00:36:31.634]  They called the mayor of San Francisco and told him not to fly.
[00:36:33.965 --> 00:36:36.306]  Deep down, you know it's a lie.
[00:36:37.666 --> 00:36:42.989]  But the globalists, the controllers, the overlords, the social architects, they've bragged about it.
[00:36:43.089 --> 00:36:58.715]  Edward Bernays, the father of modern propaganda, wrote that good propaganda speaks to our laziness, speaks to our willingness to be gullible, speaks to our willful ignorance, speaks to our procrastination.
[00:36:58.875 --> 00:36:59.555]  I don't want to...
[00:37:01.149 --> 00:37:05.092]  Last night at about midnight, I was climbing into bed after doing some research.
[00:37:06.112 --> 00:37:07.133]  I went to bed really early.
[00:37:07.193 --> 00:37:08.474]  Midnight's usually early for me.
[00:37:08.494 --> 00:37:18.480]  And I'm climbing into bed, and I pulled the covers up over me, and I'm laying there next to my wife, and I thought, man, this is really real.
[00:37:19.461 --> 00:37:20.821]  The New World Order is real.
[00:37:20.862 --> 00:37:22.042]  This tyranny is real.
[00:37:22.703 --> 00:37:23.923]  And I'm really fighting it, and...
[00:37:25.976 --> 00:37:28.318]  And, you know, I try to make excuses to myself.
[00:37:28.698 --> 00:37:32.600]  I try to deny it's as bad as all the evidence shows me.
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:38.284]  But in the final equation, it's not as bad as my intellect tells me.
[00:37:38.344 --> 00:37:39.265]  It's even worse.
[00:37:40.585 --> 00:37:47.730]  Basically, a good rule is the most horrible thing you can imagine, that's what they're doing and some.
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.261]  Because it's the very nature of power.
[00:37:52.362 --> 00:37:56.785]  They're in positions of power because they hunger and lust after power.
[00:37:57.765 --> 00:38:04.910]  And because most people who even want power still have a moral compass and aren't willing to do horrible things to get power.
[00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:09.233]  Those horrible things never even enter into most of our minds.
[00:38:11.014 --> 00:38:18.219]  The average person, you know, likes power and likes money and likes to be successful and likes to have adulation
[00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:21.781]  But you're not willing to backstab to get it.
[00:38:21.801 --> 00:38:24.322]  You're not willing to kill your grandmother for it.
[00:38:24.342 --> 00:38:29.925]  You're not willing to sell out your friends and family.
[00:38:29.945 --> 00:38:31.285]  You're not willing to cheat.
[00:38:32.086 --> 00:38:34.047]  In fact, it never enters your mind.
[00:38:35.347 --> 00:38:40.310]  Then you've got the crowd that does cheat and does backstab, but they're not that smart.
[00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:43.491]  And so they get caught, and then they get ostracized.
[00:38:43.871 --> 00:38:45.172]  They become pariahs.
[00:38:46.434 --> 00:38:56.151]  But then you've got the class of scammers and con artists and criminals that are smart and lay out their plans over long periods of time.
[00:38:57.443 --> 00:39:19.320]  And who are very good at cloaking their real designs in platitudes of helping the community and doing what's best and who own fancy advertising agencies that put out the spin, project this illusion that our leaders are heroes and not bloodthirsty, control freak killers.
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:23.323]  Alright, I've got a bunch of news in your calls.
[00:39:23.403 --> 00:39:23.964]  It's just that
[00:39:26.124 --> 00:39:28.005]  Who can deny we're losing our freedoms?
[00:39:28.226 --> 00:39:31.288]  Who can deny that America isn't what it used to be?
[00:39:31.928 --> 00:39:34.450]  Who can deny that the war on terror is a fraud?
[00:39:36.191 --> 00:39:40.934]  Who can deny that every basic canon of a free society is being dismantled?
[00:39:42.455 --> 00:39:44.797]  No really honest person can.
[00:39:47.479 --> 00:39:54.644]  And the only reason the controllers are able to do what they're doing is because so many of you are still in denial.
[00:39:55.825 --> 00:39:57.106]  All right, here's this first CBS News clip.
[00:40:22.403 --> 00:40:39.314]  Then we got a clip that Simon Aranowitz shot as two members of Parliament left the public remembrance last week, last Thursday, on the one-week anniversary of those that were killed in the London bombings.
[00:40:39.814 --> 00:40:46.839]  They had these big signs that said, London, one city, one world, you know, one world government, basically.
[00:40:49.017 --> 00:40:52.118]  And, you know, using that to push one world government.
[00:40:52.499 --> 00:40:58.101]  And then as these members of parliament break off, Simon basically chases them and asks them some important questions.
[00:40:58.501 --> 00:40:59.862]  So that clip's coming up later.
[00:41:00.442 --> 00:41:06.445]  But I do want to just go over some of the points that have been noted by callers like Rodney.
[00:41:08.325 --> 00:41:12.567]  You have the suicide bombers leaving their IDs on the seats of the buses.
[00:41:12.627 --> 00:41:15.288]  The IDs aren't destroyed.
[00:41:15.688 --> 00:41:16.689]  They're not even damaged.
[00:41:18.684 --> 00:41:19.725]  I keep saying that, though.
[00:41:19.745 --> 00:41:23.188]  They'll change their story and show you a melted ID card.
[00:41:23.208 --> 00:41:25.049]  I'm sure that'll be out within the next few days.
[00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:28.392]  But at first they're saying undamaged ID cards.
[00:41:29.813 --> 00:41:42.764]  Why did they take this one bus after the simultaneous bombings that happened on the trains, and why did the police divert it by itself and then order it to stand still and then it blew up?
[00:41:45.111 --> 00:41:50.855]  Why did the camera malfunction when eight different cameras, we now learn, go to a hard drive?
[00:41:53.117 --> 00:41:58.120]  Why are these guys giggling and laughing together as they get on the trains?
[00:42:00.121 --> 00:42:09.188]  You know, they don't fit the MO, people with eight-month-old babies who teach disabled children, people who are on a popular soccer team, football team.
[00:42:11.209 --> 00:42:12.570]  Oh, but they've been to Pakistan.
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:13.781]  The M.O.
[00:42:13.841 --> 00:42:21.786]  they fit are people recruited to be spies in their community by MI5 and Scotland Yard.
[00:42:23.568 --> 00:42:28.531]  And now this has begun to come out, so the cover story is, oh no, they weren't our spies.
[00:42:29.152 --> 00:42:31.934]  We were keeping tabs on them but didn't think they were dangerous.
[00:42:33.995 --> 00:42:36.077]  So we know they fit the classic M.O.
[00:42:36.097 --> 00:42:37.478]  of the 9-11 hijackers.
[00:42:38.319 --> 00:42:41.561]  Having their houses, cars, credit cards paid for by the government.
[00:42:43.061 --> 00:42:44.082]  Being trained at U.S.
[00:42:44.122 --> 00:42:45.082]  military bases.
[00:42:46.183 --> 00:42:47.383]  They'd leave the country.
[00:42:49.424 --> 00:42:55.828]  The local embassies and customs wouldn't want to let them in because of terrorist indicators.
[00:42:56.248 --> 00:43:04.673]  They'd be ordered by the CIA and the State Department to let them in, telling the head of one embassy it's part of a secret anti-terror program.
[00:43:04.993 --> 00:43:07.014]  These men are here for training.
[00:43:07.834 --> 00:43:09.055]  Well, that's what happened on 9-11.
[00:43:09.735 --> 00:43:10.796]  That's admitted, by the way.
[00:43:11.801 --> 00:43:21.507]  And that's the picture that's now beginning to make itself extremely clear concerning these young men.
[00:43:23.328 --> 00:43:26.050]  And then you have them buying round-trip tickets.
[00:43:28.191 --> 00:43:31.413]  You just again have all these different indicators.
[00:43:33.535 --> 00:43:35.336]  Not saying goodbye to their families.
[00:43:36.056 --> 00:43:36.397]  Nothing.
[00:43:37.477 --> 00:43:40.099]  They're just all happy like they're part of something big.
[00:43:41.116 --> 00:43:44.498]  And some have said, you know, did they think they were carrying drugs?
[00:43:46.338 --> 00:43:48.059]  Did they think they were part of a drill?
[00:43:48.139 --> 00:43:54.682]  And I tend, with all the evidence we've got, the greatest probability is that they were part of drills.
[00:43:54.702 --> 00:44:03.906]  It doesn't have to be the visor consultant's drill that the government hired to run drills of the exact same trains being bombed at the exact same times.
[00:44:04.526 --> 00:44:08.748]  The probability of that is in the trillions of trillions of trillions.
[00:44:08.848 --> 00:44:09.368]  It's just...
[00:44:11.135 --> 00:44:11.695]  Impossible.
[00:44:13.055 --> 00:44:16.856]  And it's pretty clear that, I mean, just the confidence, the happiness.
[00:44:17.777 --> 00:44:19.937]  I mean, you see real footage of suicide bombers.
[00:44:19.977 --> 00:44:26.579]  They are whacked out of their mind, totally charged up, you know, in rampage mode, screaming, Allah Akbar.
[00:44:27.519 --> 00:44:28.879]  You know, God is great.
[00:44:29.719 --> 00:44:33.920]  These guys were, several of them were very secular.
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:36.641]  The others they're claiming now have gotten religion.
[00:44:37.561 --> 00:44:40.622]  It's like the 9-11 hijackers, who we know were government agents.
[00:44:41.221 --> 00:44:42.342]  We know we're part of drills.
[00:44:42.742 --> 00:44:47.184]  They're at topless bars drinking, you know, four or five vodkas at a time.
[00:44:47.224 --> 00:44:50.686]  And Jack Daniels going, hey baby, come back to my room with me.
[00:44:51.126 --> 00:44:54.608]  Leaving Korans saying we're going to hijack planes tomorrow.
[00:44:55.708 --> 00:44:57.009]  Then getting on the planes.
[00:44:58.069 --> 00:45:00.390]  Clearly they were testing local law enforcement.
[00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:04.933]  They were testing the entire chain to see if people would warn.
[00:45:05.333 --> 00:45:06.814]  That's what they'd been told to do.
[00:45:06.834 --> 00:45:09.615]  It's like actor James Woods.
[00:45:10.518 --> 00:45:16.263]  Right after 9-11, he goes on Fox News and says, Look, a week ago, I was on a plane from New York to L.A.
[00:45:16.303 --> 00:45:17.384]  We stopped in Phoenix.
[00:45:19.806 --> 00:45:21.227]  By the way, you can pull those articles up.
[00:45:21.567 --> 00:45:25.510]  They're on presentplanet.com and infowars.com, the 9-11 section.
[00:45:27.592 --> 00:45:33.657]  And they said that, clearly, he's on the plane.
[00:45:33.697 --> 00:45:37.400]  They were getting up, acting weird, acting like they were simulating some type of hijacking.
[00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:38.721]  He gets off the plane and says, Stop them!
[00:45:38.741 --> 00:45:39.161]  Stop them!
[00:45:39.822 --> 00:45:39.982]  The...
[00:45:40.669 --> 00:45:41.570]  They're hijackers.
[00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:43.371]  They're training for hijacking.
[00:45:44.532 --> 00:45:48.055]  The FBI pulls him aside, comes in and says, keep your mouth shut.
[00:45:48.475 --> 00:45:50.537]  This is part of national security.
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:56.142]  Now, folks, that's even actor James Woods.
[00:45:57.743 --> 00:45:58.103]  Okay?
[00:45:59.664 --> 00:46:01.246]  And so it's the same M.O.
[00:46:01.326 --> 00:46:01.586]  here.
[00:46:03.327 --> 00:46:05.229]  It's like the head of Pakistani intelligence.
[00:46:06.696 --> 00:46:07.777]  Known CIA.
[00:46:07.817 --> 00:46:10.538]  Musharraf put in by the CIA.
[00:46:10.558 --> 00:46:12.380]  Wires $100,000 to Mohammed Adda.
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:17.263]  Our government gives almost as much money to Pakistan as they do to Israel.
[00:46:17.283 --> 00:46:18.664]  You never hear about that, though, do you?
[00:46:19.824 --> 00:46:23.066]  And General Mahmoud Ahmed wires $100,000 to Mohammed Adda, the lead hijacker.
[00:46:28.473 --> 00:46:33.315]  All right, let's go ahead and play the CBS piece and decipher the latest propaganda.
[00:46:33.335 --> 00:46:33.755]  Here it is.
[00:46:34.135 --> 00:46:41.317]  Carefully wrapped to protect any evidence, the wreckage of the bombed bus was driven away from Tavistock Square in central London.
[00:46:42.358 --> 00:46:47.959]  A new picture released today shows the four bombers before they parted ways on their deadly missions.
[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:52.641]  That was ten days ago, and still the police search is expanding.
[00:46:53.556 --> 00:46:58.917]  Crime scene tape and screens went up in front of yet another house in the northern city of Leeds.
[00:46:59.417 --> 00:47:10.080]  Police there are also combing through a Muslim youth center and an Islamic bookstore, trying to piece together just how the young men knew each other and who was giving them their orders.
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:14.841]  And what we are confronting here is an evil ideology.
[00:47:16.141 --> 00:47:18.262]  It is not a clash of civilizations.
[00:47:18.842 --> 00:47:22.863]  All civilized people, Muslim or other, feel revulsion at it.
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:25.660]  But it is a global struggle.
[00:47:25.841 --> 00:47:28.061]  The investigation, too, has gone global.
[00:47:28.562 --> 00:47:35.444]  In Egypt, police are still questioning Magdi al-Nasher, a chemist who rented the apartment used as a bomb factory.
[00:47:36.324 --> 00:47:44.787]  And in Pakistan, investigators want to know who 22-year-old bomber Shehzad Tanweer visited during his two recent visits there.
[00:47:45.288 --> 00:47:45.988]  On the Internet,
[00:47:46.528 --> 00:47:54.670]  Websites where militant Islamists often claim responsibility for attacks around the world have been uncharacteristically silent about the London bombings.
[00:47:55.931 --> 00:48:02.292]  Today, the family of the bomber Shehzad Tanweer issued a statement of sorrow and condolence to the bomber's victims.
[00:48:02.712 --> 00:48:08.574]  They asked for people's cooperation in exposing the terror networks which target and groom our sons.
[00:48:10.074 --> 00:48:19.558]  This message is certainly going to help in the effort to defuse any tension in British society in the wake of the bombings and particularly to prevent any anti-Muslim backlash.
[00:48:20.158 --> 00:48:20.498]  Susan?
[00:48:20.738 --> 00:48:25.320]  Liz, what's been the reaction in the Muslim community and are they cooperating with police there?
[00:48:26.841 --> 00:48:27.981]  Great solidarity.
[00:48:28.461 --> 00:48:32.663]  All the Muslim leaders have said unequivocally that these bombings were...
[00:48:34.315 --> 00:48:42.781]  Okay, so instantly, day one, when they tell us about the bombers, they're guilty.
[00:48:43.141 --> 00:48:43.982]  They're the bombers.
[00:48:44.122 --> 00:48:46.143]  And then later in the article it says suspects.
[00:48:47.024 --> 00:48:50.646]  Now notice in just the course of a week, oh no, now they are the bombers.
[00:48:51.067 --> 00:48:51.887]  We've convicted them.
[00:48:53.028 --> 00:48:59.172]  Now, Tony Blair is saying, and the media are all saying, we know they were controlled.
[00:49:00.193 --> 00:49:02.695]  We're going to find out who was controlling them.
[00:49:04.198 --> 00:49:06.419]  Well, how about you look in the mirror, Tony Blair?
[00:49:08.059 --> 00:49:11.161]  And it's so easy for him to set up one of these operations.
[00:49:12.101 --> 00:49:24.165]  And again, do not forget the government was running a drill with visor consultants on that morning at the very same time at the very same train stations.
[00:49:25.826 --> 00:49:31.128]  And first they say that the bombings were over a long period of time.
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:36.941]  Then they say, oh no, they're in about a 45-second period.
[00:49:37.262 --> 00:49:38.923]  They were almost simultaneous.
[00:49:39.963 --> 00:49:42.145]  And they tried to say that it was a power surge.
[00:49:42.185 --> 00:49:48.249]  Now, everybody knows, and it's now admitted, the government knew it was bombings right away.
[00:49:49.490 --> 00:49:51.331]  But something had gone wrong on the bus.
[00:49:52.372 --> 00:49:56.214]  It hadn't done what it was supposed to.
[00:49:56.334 --> 00:49:57.175]  It didn't blow up.
[00:49:58.692 --> 00:50:01.173]  And so it's driving around town, and this is on the record.
[00:50:01.553 --> 00:50:10.275]  The police stand out out of hundreds of buses and wave it in to a side street and into Tavistock Square, and then it blows up.
[00:50:11.255 --> 00:50:13.675]  And blood splatters right on the Tavistock building.
[00:50:14.315 --> 00:50:18.716]  They have those photos posted on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:50:18.756 --> 00:50:21.337]  So you've got simultaneous bombs.
[00:50:21.717 --> 00:50:26.418]  They say it's a power surge, and they're saying that for an hour and a half.
[00:50:27.182 --> 00:50:36.786]  But no need to have that cover story anymore after they got the bus waved into where it was supposed to go and made sure whatever wasn't exploding on time did, didn't they?
[00:50:39.007 --> 00:50:40.587]  Isn't that just classic?
[00:50:44.049 --> 00:50:52.912]  And remember, the British government has been caught carrying out terror before to blame it on their political enemies and as a pretext to set up a police state.
[00:50:54.884 --> 00:51:00.085]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with your calls, other clips, and a ton of news.
[00:51:02.346 --> 00:51:09.728]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:51:10.008 --> 00:51:14.749]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:51:14.969 --> 00:51:20.611]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:51:20.851 --> 00:51:25.392]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:51:25.592 --> 00:51:32.754]  The cashless society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:51:32.774 --> 00:51:37.255]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.456 --> 00:51:39.976]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:51:40.216 --> 00:51:46.578]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional reform.
[00:51:46.578 --> 00:51:47.159]  Or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:47.239 --> 00:51:47.479]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:52:01.972 --> 00:52:04.976]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:52:05.317 --> 00:52:14.148]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:52:14.469 --> 00:52:19.155]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:19.595 --> 00:52:26.321]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:52:26.722 --> 00:52:38.512]  It also removes foul-tasted odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:38.972 --> 00:52:43.435]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:52:43.595 --> 00:52:45.937]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:45.957 --> 00:52:47.918]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:52:47.938 --> 00:52:49.139]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:52:49.219 --> 00:52:51.300]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:52.341]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:01.681 --> 00:53:02.221]  We're good to go.
[00:53:24.858 --> 00:53:25.438]  We're good to go.
[00:53:41.903 --> 00:53:42.323]  Death?
[00:53:42.423 --> 00:53:44.244]  Don't take unnecessary risks.
[00:53:44.464 --> 00:53:48.124]  Keep your arteries healthy and clear by taking Heart and Body Extract.
[00:53:48.164 --> 00:53:50.745]  To get Heart and Body Extract, go to heartandbodyextract.com or call 1-866-295-5305.
[00:53:50.765 --> 00:53:51.085]  That's 866-295-5305.
[00:53:51.105 --> 00:53:51.485]  Call now.
[00:53:51.505 --> 00:53:53.646]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:53:53.666 --> 00:53:55.466]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:09.401 --> 00:54:14.544]  Alright, Michael and Clifford and Chris and Matt and Don, everybody, your calls are coming up.
[00:54:15.564 --> 00:54:17.025]  I'll go to them a little bit quicker here.
[00:54:17.986 --> 00:54:23.269]  It's just that there's so many facets, so many angles to the London bombings.
[00:54:24.509 --> 00:54:31.373]  And they fit in with the Madrid bombings, they fit in with Operation Gladio, they fit in with Operation Northwoods, they fit in...
[00:54:32.156 --> 00:54:39.999]  With our Western governments being caught over and over again carrying out bombings and blaming them on their enemies.
[00:54:41.059 --> 00:54:59.726]  For any of you that have trouble grasping this, again, Kermit Roosevelt, the grandson of the President, was a top CIA officer in 1953, and he and just a few other agents with big old suitcases of gold
[00:55:00.658 --> 00:55:09.160]  Went into Iran, carried out bombings all over the country, blamed it on Mosaddegh, and removed him from office by blaming it on him.
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:11.981]  And then the guy went on NPR.
[00:55:12.061 --> 00:55:13.341]  I mean, we already knew about this.
[00:55:14.302 --> 00:55:17.442]  But he went on NPR and admitted it.
[00:55:17.582 --> 00:55:19.043]  I mean, I'm blown away.
[00:55:19.063 --> 00:55:23.764]  These guys, decades later, admit what they do?
[00:55:24.665 --> 00:55:39.090]  We get their declassified documents from the 60s and the 70s and the 80s, and yes, even the 90s, and then it happens again, and we just, oh, well, it doesn't matter if the government's done it before.
[00:55:39.110 --> 00:55:41.770]  It doesn't matter if we have their own documents.
[00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:43.751]  It doesn't matter if they have the motive.
[00:55:43.911 --> 00:55:46.772]  It doesn't matter if the official story stinks to high heaven.
[00:55:47.572 --> 00:55:50.033]  I just can't believe our government would do that.
[00:55:52.222 --> 00:55:56.626]  They could care less about collateral damage when they blow up a whole neighborhood, folks, overseas.
[00:55:58.267 --> 00:56:00.208]  You think our government will only kill Muslims?
[00:56:00.228 --> 00:56:01.690]  They kill Christians in Serbia.
[00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:03.351]  They bomb their cities.
[00:56:03.971 --> 00:56:06.774]  Massive bombardments blowing up entire neighborhoods.
[00:56:07.294 --> 00:56:09.095]  Tens of thousands die every night.
[00:56:09.696 --> 00:56:10.516]  You think they care?
[00:56:10.557 --> 00:56:15.761]  You think the globalists care about 55 people on some trains and a bus?
[00:56:17.242 --> 00:56:18.523]  Stop being naive.
[00:56:20.532 --> 00:56:22.393]  The globalists are deadly dangerous.
[00:56:23.353 --> 00:56:24.374]  They're very cunning.
[00:56:25.074 --> 00:56:25.854]  They're ruthless.
[00:56:27.875 --> 00:56:29.976]  I want to go to calls right now, so I'm just going to say this.
[00:56:30.556 --> 00:56:35.258]  We have a bookstore and a video store on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:56:35.538 --> 00:56:36.819]  Secure, safe shopping cart.
[00:56:37.219 --> 00:56:41.240]  All my films, a bunch of other great books and videos we carry by other researchers.
[00:56:41.261 --> 00:56:42.621]  The best stuff out there available.
[00:56:43.081 --> 00:56:45.262]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:56:45.662 --> 00:56:47.223]  My new film, Martial Law, is out.
[00:56:48.138 --> 00:56:50.559]  I hope you'll get it and make copies of it and get it out to people.
[00:56:51.359 --> 00:56:54.141]  It exposes who was behind 9-11 and other terror events.
[00:56:54.361 --> 00:56:56.282]  Very important to do that.
[00:56:56.302 --> 00:57:07.687]  1-888-253-3139 or InfoWars.com Alright, let's go ahead and talk to Michael in New York and Clifford and others.
[00:57:07.727 --> 00:57:08.287]  Go ahead, Michael.
[00:57:09.039 --> 00:57:10.240]  Alex, great to speak with you.
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:17.245]  On the martial law video, just real quick, that dual layer density is required to make copies of that DVD.
[00:57:17.345 --> 00:57:24.149]  I use an Apple, and so far I'm trying to find a software that's up to date for burning such a DVD.
[00:57:24.189 --> 00:57:33.395]  I don't know maybe if it's easier to put them on two separate DVDs when you're going that length of time so we could make copies, of course, and keep them going around for you.
[00:57:35.034 --> 00:57:37.757]  That news report, you know, you can't listen to them, Alex.
[00:57:37.917 --> 00:57:49.069]  After listening to this, your station, everybody on GCN Live, you can't go back and listen to those news bunnies who are just spewing their propaganda from their controlled elite.
[00:57:49.570 --> 00:57:51.592]  It's just so boring and so obvious.
[00:57:52.553 --> 00:57:57.158]  Now, you know, on the History Channel recently, this is really good.
[00:57:58.022 --> 00:57:58.683]  I like to watch.
[00:57:58.723 --> 00:58:00.884]  That's one of the only stations good on the boob tube.
[00:58:00.904 --> 00:58:04.327]  And every so often you can catch something that slips out.
[00:58:04.847 --> 00:58:11.232]  So they were showing after World War II how we recruited a lot of the Nazi scientists and the Russian commies tried to get their share.
[00:58:12.012 --> 00:58:13.373]  And so we got most of them.
[00:58:13.933 --> 00:58:20.138]  And the commies in Russia couldn't develop the jet engine post-World War II and we were advancing further ahead.
[00:58:20.858 --> 00:58:23.260]  And so they were struggling for the longest time.
[00:58:23.580 --> 00:58:24.621]  And then lo and behold,
[00:58:25.786 --> 00:58:35.956]  I think some Russian scientists go to England and they say on the show how over a billiard table, the shooting pool... Say what?
[00:58:36.016 --> 00:58:36.537]  Stay there.
[00:58:37.558 --> 00:58:38.519]  I'll let you finish up.
[00:58:38.979 --> 00:58:39.720]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:41.101 --> 00:58:46.006]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:58.104 --> 00:58:58.764]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.425 --> 00:59:00.485]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.185 --> 00:59:02.286]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.946 --> 00:59:03.786]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.526 --> 00:59:05.427]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.087 --> 00:59:09.708]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.268 --> 00:59:14.410]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.530 --> 00:59:16.511]  Music
[00:59:30.570 --> 00:59:33.533]  All right, we're now into our number two.
[00:59:34.634 --> 00:59:36.275]  We're taking your calls.
[00:59:37.536 --> 00:59:51.088]  The European Union is moving ahead with its expansion, its destruction of the different countries' sovereignty, despite the fact that it's been roundly rebuked by the population.
[00:59:52.129 --> 00:59:55.692]  Same thing's happening here with CAFTA and the free trade area of the Americas.
[00:59:55.712 --> 00:59:56.473]  We'll be getting into that.
[00:59:57.852 --> 01:00:00.154]  And of course, we're taking your calls.
[01:00:00.194 --> 01:00:07.020]  The listeners are wanting to talk about, predominantly, still the London bombings.
[01:00:08.221 --> 01:00:16.087]  Isn't it interesting how they get us to focus on the London bombings, but every day there's massive bombings all over the world, and the average person isn't even aware of those.
[01:00:16.127 --> 01:00:18.489]  You see, they choose what to focus on.
[01:00:19.438 --> 01:00:25.301]  And it's time that we start to focus on what we think is important, not just what the establishment press pushes.
[01:00:25.741 --> 01:00:27.722]  Michael in New York, finish up what you were saying.
[01:00:28.083 --> 01:00:28.703]  Yes, sir, Alex.
[01:00:29.243 --> 01:00:37.848]  And so on History Channel, they're showing how the Russian commies tried to get their share in Nazi scientists post-World War II, but they couldn't get enough to get the jet engine off the ground.
[01:00:38.368 --> 01:00:39.929]  And they were struggling, struggling.
[01:00:40.309 --> 01:00:41.730]  We advanced further ahead.
[01:00:42.130 --> 01:00:58.059]  And so one day, they claim how Russian scientists were hanging out in Britain with English scientists over a billiard table, and after the game, for some reason, the British just said, hey, here's a Rolls-Royce jet engine.
[01:00:58.119 --> 01:00:59.039]  Take it home with you.
[01:00:59.499 --> 01:01:06.023]  And then they go on to say in the show how, unfortunately, just a few years later, the Korean War develops, and those
[01:01:06.603 --> 01:01:10.506]  Those jet engines were now used in mid-fighter shooting down our boys.
[01:01:10.887 --> 01:01:12.488]  And it's like, bam, there it is.
[01:01:12.948 --> 01:01:13.769]  It slipped out.
[01:01:14.410 --> 01:01:17.052]  We supply and build up all our enemies.
[01:01:17.312 --> 01:01:19.034]  They knew the Korean War was coming.
[01:01:19.354 --> 01:01:23.737]  They couldn't be a threat to us unless they had a technology to rival ours.
[01:01:23.777 --> 01:01:30.383]  They couldn't get it off the ground, so we gave it to them so that they could be a threat and then we'd have to get dragged into another...
[01:01:31.329 --> 01:01:33.793]  Foreign conflict and so forth.
[01:01:34.414 --> 01:01:40.525]  Every so often, because we have our eyes wide open, we've got the whole picture, you can see through it when it slips out of the cracks.
[01:01:42.463 --> 01:01:48.567]  Well, I was actually aware of that story, and yeah, because they like playing pool.
[01:01:48.667 --> 01:01:53.610]  Here, it's classified, we can be executed for this, but here, just have a jet engine.
[01:01:54.130 --> 01:02:01.735]  Our government helped develop the Russian nuclear program, because they had to have an enemy, and that enemy had to be on par with them.
[01:02:01.755 --> 01:02:08.219]  Look, the Rothschilds would do this, the Crumps would do this with weapon sales, and the Rothschilds would just make the loans.
[01:02:09.213 --> 01:02:16.302]  They would sell the latest weapon system to somebody, but then sell it to the other side to keep the arms race going.
[01:02:16.362 --> 01:02:17.643]  It's really quite simple.
[01:02:19.145 --> 01:02:23.851]  And this is all admitted, but so many people are in denial, Michael.
[01:02:23.891 --> 01:02:24.551]  Thanks for the call.
[01:02:25.112 --> 01:02:26.153]  Yeah, that's a great call.
[01:02:26.574 --> 01:02:28.196]  I appreciate you pointing that out for people.
[01:02:28.803 --> 01:02:30.283]  And it's just like Al-Qaeda.
[01:02:30.404 --> 01:02:37.346]  The Russians fall apart, so now we've got the Muslim extremists who just so happen to be former CIA that fought the Russians.
[01:02:37.406 --> 01:02:38.906]  But never mind that.
[01:02:39.406 --> 01:02:41.547]  The government wouldn't carry out bombings.
[01:02:42.607 --> 01:02:43.167]  Clifford.
[01:02:43.687 --> 01:02:45.048]  Clifford in Detroit.
[01:02:45.088 --> 01:02:45.608]  Go ahead.
[01:02:46.128 --> 01:02:47.169]  Yes, how you doing today?
[01:02:47.389 --> 01:02:47.729]  Good, sir.
[01:02:48.089 --> 01:02:51.790]  Yes, I was told that you are a very reliable, good person to talk to.
[01:02:52.979 --> 01:02:53.880]  I don't know if that's true.
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:56.821]  I would just check out the things I claim for yourself, sir.
[01:02:57.201 --> 01:02:57.702]  Okay.
[01:02:58.102 --> 01:03:03.164]  I was calling you about, I know you're aware there's a meritorial race going on in Detroit.
[01:03:04.105 --> 01:03:04.665]  A little bit.
[01:03:04.685 --> 01:03:05.626]  Why don't you fill me in?
[01:03:05.866 --> 01:03:07.427]  Well, I'm one of the candidates running.
[01:03:08.707 --> 01:03:12.409]  And what they have, they have 12 candidates running.
[01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:15.711]  The media is showing you four candidates running.
[01:03:16.567 --> 01:03:21.970]  They're bombarding four people on constantly, every day, saying these are the only candidates that's running for mayor.
[01:03:22.050 --> 01:03:23.351]  Well, that's what they always do.
[01:03:23.631 --> 01:03:27.793]  Right, and the funny thing about it, all four candidates are attorneys.
[01:03:29.334 --> 01:03:30.575]  Well, I'll tell you what, sir.
[01:03:31.175 --> 01:03:31.816]  Stay there, Clever.
[01:03:31.836 --> 01:03:32.276]  We'll break.
[01:03:32.316 --> 01:03:33.417]  I'll come right back to you.
[01:03:34.277 --> 01:03:43.142]  And if I can help you in any way with any of my paltry advice, then I will certainly try to do that, my friend.
[01:03:43.182 --> 01:03:44.663]  But you can take the advice...
[01:03:45.365 --> 01:03:46.446]  You know, for what it's worth.
[01:03:47.186 --> 01:03:48.246]  I'm not sure what it's worth.
[01:03:48.587 --> 01:03:49.627]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:03:49.667 --> 01:03:51.688]  PrisonPlanet.tv and FullWars.com.
[01:03:54.229 --> 01:03:57.091]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.351 --> 01:03:58.031]  Hello, my friends.
[01:03:58.131 --> 01:03:58.912]  Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.252 --> 01:04:03.954]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.274 --> 01:04:08.697]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:04:09.117 --> 01:04:13.299]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:13.519 --> 01:04:16.341]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.441 --> 01:04:21.124]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.324 --> 01:04:25.747]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight, piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:25.967 --> 01:04:33.192]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:33.432 --> 01:04:35.854]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[01:04:36.034 --> 01:04:37.775]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[01:04:53.417 --> 01:05:04.142]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:05:04.322 --> 01:05:11.925]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:05:12.166 --> 01:05:15.307]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:05:15.447 --> 01:05:15.847]  We're good to go.
[01:05:34.136 --> 01:05:40.081]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:05:40.301 --> 01:05:44.565]  Get the Perky Light, a transparent water filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:05:55.145 --> 01:05:56.846]  ...from pain, illness, and disease.
[01:05:57.006 --> 01:06:05.429]  When natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach, hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:13.613]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:06:13.773 --> 01:06:20.816]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:06:21.036 --> 01:06:21.577]  We're good to go.
[01:06:45.578 --> 01:06:58.106]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.526 --> 01:07:00.807]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:02.929 --> 01:07:05.170]  Look at this disgraceful headline.
[01:07:05.890 --> 01:07:10.013]  Military finds military innocent of torture at Gitmo.
[01:07:11.101 --> 01:07:31.399]  Military investigators examining alleged abuse of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, say they found treatment such as leashing a terror suspect and forcing him to behave like a dog, but they said they found no evidence of torture or that senior leaders imprisoned but imposed faulty interrogation policies.
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:38.565]  Brigadier General Rick Baucus, two and a half years ago, left Guantanamo Bay
[01:07:39.585 --> 01:07:42.806]  Resigned from Guantanamo Bay, refusing to torture.
[01:07:43.306 --> 01:07:48.047]  The Attorney General's own memos say that they table people.
[01:07:49.287 --> 01:07:51.708]  That is, dunk them in water until they're about to pass out.
[01:07:51.728 --> 01:07:55.109]  Until they're about to basically asphyxiate.
[01:07:55.989 --> 01:08:05.631]  That they bring in prostitutes to have sex with the men, which totally freaks out these devout Muslims, and they think they're going to hell.
[01:08:06.730 --> 01:08:11.814]  The prostitutes do some other stuff I can't mention, but it's serial killer type, you know, raping.
[01:08:12.714 --> 01:08:14.155]  It's always sexually perverted.
[01:08:14.175 --> 01:08:15.096]  That's the New World Order.
[01:08:15.496 --> 01:08:17.518]  But all that's normal, all that's good.
[01:08:17.718 --> 01:08:18.498]  That's no big deal.
[01:08:18.518 --> 01:08:19.399]  That's not torture.
[01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:21.821]  So this is just incredible.
[01:08:21.841 --> 01:08:23.061]  We're going to get into that also.
[01:08:24.102 --> 01:08:25.723]  We've got to move quickly here through the calls.
[01:08:26.244 --> 01:08:28.145]  Clifford in Detroit just called in.
[01:08:28.165 --> 01:08:29.546]  We were talking to him in the last segment.
[01:08:29.946 --> 01:08:35.050]  He said he's running for mayor, and there's 12 people running for mayor in Detroit.
[01:08:36.079 --> 01:08:43.622]  And that he's one of the people, and that he's being ignored, that they're focusing in on four establishment candidates who are all lawyers.
[01:08:43.762 --> 01:08:45.603]  So how can I help you, Clifford?
[01:08:46.543 --> 01:08:50.324]  Yes, what I want to explain is not really being ignored.
[01:08:50.404 --> 01:08:58.828]  What it is they're doing is they're putting four people out there, making everybody think it's four candidates when in reality it's one.
[01:08:59.328 --> 01:09:05.190]  But the candidate they're scared of, they're out there now, got put a warrant out for my arrest,
[01:09:06.089 --> 01:09:07.370]  Because I'm telling the truth.
[01:09:08.391 --> 01:09:11.733]  And they said I unarmed robbed somebody, which is not my makeup.
[01:09:12.753 --> 01:09:16.976]  And the gentleman that they're using is somebody that had jumped on my daughter a year ago.
[01:09:17.276 --> 01:09:23.981]  The police department went to him to get him to lie to say that I robbed him unarmed.
[01:09:25.083 --> 01:09:30.047]  Well, I mean, that big city crime machines are known to frame people.
[01:09:30.567 --> 01:09:32.889]  Has your story been in the newspaper?
[01:09:32.909 --> 01:09:35.270]  They're trying to publish it in another newspaper.
[01:09:35.290 --> 01:09:43.416]  No, what it is, they want me to be arrested first, then the news media want to be there when I get arrested to put it in the newspaper.
[01:09:43.456 --> 01:09:45.718]  Well, what numbers are you getting in polls, Clifford?
[01:09:46.578 --> 01:09:48.259]  Well, my name is on the top of the list.
[01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:53.643]  I did a show with a big, strong candidate in Detroit that's been on council for 27 years.
[01:09:55.296 --> 01:09:58.659]  Clifford, you're going to need to send me some information on this.
[01:09:58.779 --> 01:09:59.519]  Oh, I definitely will.
[01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:03.943]  I have a lot of information to send on a lot of things they're doing that they don't want the people to know.
[01:10:04.203 --> 01:10:06.925]  Oh, believe me, I'm fully aware of how corrupt Detroit is.
[01:10:06.946 --> 01:10:07.646]  Thanks for the call.
[01:10:08.467 --> 01:10:10.929]  This sounds like classic big city machine stuff.
[01:10:11.890 --> 01:10:13.691]  Let's talk to Chris in Kentucky.
[01:10:13.711 --> 01:10:14.412]  Chris, go ahead.
[01:10:14.972 --> 01:10:17.334]  Thanks, Alex, and best of luck to Clifford up there.
[01:10:17.434 --> 01:10:19.956]  Clifford, get on Power Hour and Wichita and other shows as well.
[01:10:20.416 --> 01:10:22.218]  I had a news article that
[01:10:22.799 --> 01:10:26.541]  News clip, actually, was about the smoking ban in Lexington, Kentucky.
[01:10:27.061 --> 01:10:28.282]  Well, this is what they're going to do.
[01:10:28.342 --> 01:10:36.586]  They want to condition people to get in the database by taking hair samples and how healthy your hair is without all the secondhand smoke.
[01:10:36.646 --> 01:10:37.887]  And I'm not buying that fraud.
[01:10:37.947 --> 01:10:42.149]  That is nothing but a database conditioning people to accept this.
[01:10:42.769 --> 01:10:46.991]  And people in the Lexington area, if you're on the Internet, are listening to this show, don't buy it.
[01:10:47.191 --> 01:10:49.893]  Well, they have a hundred different gimmicks to...
[01:10:50.737 --> 01:10:53.560]  Get your retina scanned, to get your hair, to get your blood.
[01:10:53.620 --> 01:11:04.289]  Listen, I have an article here where people are finally protesting at Disney World and Disneyland over the hand scans to get in.
[01:11:04.329 --> 01:11:06.471]  I mean, what's the point of that?
[01:11:06.511 --> 01:11:08.473]  It's about getting you into the database.
[01:11:09.233 --> 01:11:11.555]  It is, and it is with the state workers here in Kentucky.
[01:11:11.575 --> 01:11:12.356]  You work for the state.
[01:11:12.376 --> 01:11:15.959]  You've got to get into a digital thumb scan and fingerprinting before you can work for the state.
[01:11:16.019 --> 01:11:17.721]  It's all database collection.
[01:11:18.228 --> 01:11:19.529]  And people don't seem to see this.
[01:11:19.729 --> 01:11:21.590]  They're just so asleep until it's going to be too late.
[01:11:22.631 --> 01:11:28.435]  I'm going to, you know, take action, and I'm just going to keep going with this because... So now they're saying, hey, we got a smoking ban.
[01:11:28.495 --> 01:11:29.336]  It's wonderful.
[01:11:29.896 --> 01:11:31.357]  Let us test your hair.
[01:11:31.457 --> 01:11:32.458]  What does that even mean?
[01:11:32.758 --> 01:11:36.461]  Yeah, just to see how, you know, how secondhand smoke.
[01:11:36.501 --> 01:11:37.601]  And it was on the news about it.
[01:11:37.622 --> 01:11:39.303]  Like, oh, that is such a fraud.
[01:11:39.323 --> 01:11:39.963]  I just could not believe it.
[01:11:39.983 --> 01:11:43.225]  So what, are they having, like, clinics where they test your hair and show you the nicotine?
[01:11:43.426 --> 01:11:45.207]  Yeah, it's in the Lexington area.
[01:11:45.427 --> 01:11:46.868]  They were doing it with a smoking ban there.
[01:11:48.195 --> 01:11:49.135]  Don't buy this, people.
[01:11:49.416 --> 01:11:50.816]  Don't buy this fraud.
[01:11:51.016 --> 01:11:51.376]  I hear you.
[01:11:51.436 --> 01:11:52.556]  Thanks for the call, Chris.
[01:11:53.857 --> 01:11:57.357]  Let me give you an example of total police state.
[01:11:58.598 --> 01:12:15.602]  Before 9-11, even before that increase in the police state climate, that ratcheting up of the fear, here on local cable, every single night, or every weeknight,
[01:12:18.012 --> 01:12:21.014]  They would have a show called Army News Watch.
[01:12:23.896 --> 01:12:28.458]  And it was only a new show every week, but they would just re-air the show over and over again.
[01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:31.740]  And they would air it on Channel 16.
[01:12:32.341 --> 01:12:34.562]  Now it's on Channel 16 and on Channel 17.
[01:12:35.503 --> 01:12:38.324]  It's not just on a local cable access.
[01:12:38.364 --> 01:12:40.205]  Now it's on the county channel 17.
[01:12:40.986 --> 01:12:44.308]  But back then it was just on one channel.
[01:12:46.446 --> 01:12:50.189]  And they would have locally produced news pieces for them from all over the country.
[01:12:50.229 --> 01:12:54.232]  And one of the pieces was out of an Air Force base in San Antonio.
[01:12:56.134 --> 01:12:59.196]  And they were saying, you know, drugs hurt the country.
[01:12:59.817 --> 01:13:02.259]  Drugs undermine our national strength.
[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:04.721]  Drugs are a major problem.
[01:13:06.082 --> 01:13:11.947]  Employers out there, this is a quote, whether you have two employees or a hundred employees...
[01:13:15.174 --> 01:13:21.137]  We will drop by every week or every month, whatever you wish, and drug test your employees free of charge.
[01:13:23.618 --> 01:13:24.479]  Get involved.
[01:13:24.619 --> 01:13:33.904]  And so this is the military getting involved in private life, in private corporations, wanting to come and drug test your employees.
[01:13:36.678 --> 01:13:45.485]  And we have the newscasts from Mardi Gras in Galveston, Texas, and Fiesta in San Antonio, and different events in Dallas.
[01:13:46.246 --> 01:13:53.432]  And they will have regular Army MPs out, and they'll search cars, and they'll aid the police, and they'll check IDs at bars.
[01:13:54.993 --> 01:13:58.616]  The government openly says they want to get rid of Posse Comitatus.
[01:13:58.976 --> 01:14:00.137]  They're doing it.
[01:14:00.437 --> 01:14:03.580]  The 1878 law barring the military engaging in law enforcement.
[01:14:05.774 --> 01:14:06.774]  But just slowly.
[01:14:06.814 --> 01:14:08.255]  Well, not so slowly anymore.
[01:14:08.355 --> 01:14:09.475]  It's just everywhere.
[01:14:10.855 --> 01:14:15.376]  Training the military, training the population, training the local constabulary to accept this.
[01:14:15.697 --> 01:14:18.537]  They have these Marine Corps and Army drills all over the country.
[01:14:18.577 --> 01:14:22.018]  I've been to about, I don't know, 11 or 12 of them over the years.
[01:14:22.838 --> 01:14:26.579]  And listeners have sent us video from, you know, probably 20 other events.
[01:14:26.619 --> 01:14:27.960]  We've got many of them in my films.
[01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:32.621]  And there they are, running checkpoints.
[01:14:34.372 --> 01:14:35.393]  Searching cars.
[01:14:35.894 --> 01:14:39.717]  Not just doing drills, but actually engaging in law enforcement.
[01:14:41.258 --> 01:14:42.299]  It's so scary.
[01:14:44.161 --> 01:14:46.984]  Let's go ahead and talk to Matt in Tennessee.
[01:14:47.024 --> 01:14:47.764]  Matt, go ahead.
[01:14:48.926 --> 01:14:50.707]  Taking my call, Alex.
[01:14:51.308 --> 01:14:54.551]  I have a question for you, but I've got to give you some quick background.
[01:14:54.831 --> 01:14:59.095]  Last Saturday, I was listening to an enemy transmission from the local...
[01:15:00.014 --> 01:15:00.614]  We're good to go.
[01:15:24.742 --> 01:15:39.489]  I do know the name, but I don't know if Mr. Gutierrez is a member of... I know our Attorney General, Alberto, I love torture, Bush is above the law, I love abortion, give me your guns.
[01:15:40.469 --> 01:15:43.251]  Gonzalez is.
[01:15:44.531 --> 01:15:50.414]  But regardless, they have got their people all over supposed conservative talk radio.
[01:15:51.132 --> 01:15:56.414]  Telling us how great CAFTA is, which the Senate has now passed and is now in the House.
[01:15:57.335 --> 01:16:00.937]  And it's wildly unpopular.
[01:16:01.037 --> 01:16:01.937]  It's un-American.
[01:16:02.277 --> 01:16:05.719]  So why are so-called conservative stations still promoting it?
[01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:09.601]  Well, they're not so conservative, that's for sure.
[01:16:09.681 --> 01:16:15.503]  But your show has really helped me understand the phony left-right paradigm.
[01:16:16.184 --> 01:16:17.084]  And there's really...
[01:16:18.961 --> 01:16:23.864]  Really, the only thing the left and the right disagree on is communism or national socialism, in my opinion.
[01:16:24.284 --> 01:16:27.165]  And they're all bureau-centric.
[01:16:27.426 --> 01:16:29.267]  They're all for bigger government.
[01:16:29.527 --> 01:16:31.588]  And just God bless you, Alex.
[01:16:32.368 --> 01:16:38.631]  If you can, can you do any research if you have time and try to find out if Gutierrez is a member of MEChA?
[01:16:39.872 --> 01:16:40.432]  Certainly.
[01:16:40.872 --> 01:16:46.395]  I will tell you that most of the people that Bush or Clinton or anybody else chooses normally are.
[01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:52.261]  Because Hispanics are such good patriotic people, it's hard for them to find really bad ones.
[01:16:52.741 --> 01:16:57.063]  So they go right to the same rotten bucket to find them, and most of them are.
[01:16:58.243 --> 01:17:05.905]  But most of the leaders that Bush picks, he doesn't want a good patriotic Hispanic in there, so he goes out and finds a good little globalist.
[01:17:06.785 --> 01:17:07.065]  Right.
[01:17:07.506 --> 01:17:09.006]  Well, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:17:09.146 --> 01:17:09.706]  Hang in there.
[01:17:09.886 --> 01:17:10.646]  Well, I will, sir.
[01:17:10.926 --> 01:17:11.847]  And thank you for the call.
[01:17:11.867 --> 01:17:12.447]  God bless you.
[01:17:15.473 --> 01:17:17.493]  Matt just crystallized everything.
[01:17:19.794 --> 01:17:22.614]  It's a choice between National Socialism and Communism.
[01:17:23.434 --> 01:17:24.815]  The police wear black masks.
[01:17:24.855 --> 01:17:25.955]  There's cameras everywhere.
[01:17:26.015 --> 01:17:26.975]  There's secret police.
[01:17:28.735 --> 01:17:30.176]  The government tells you what to do.
[01:17:31.636 --> 01:17:32.656]  There's no real difference.
[01:17:33.496 --> 01:17:34.896]  Let's talk to Don in Ohio.
[01:17:34.956 --> 01:17:35.697]  Don, go ahead.
[01:17:37.217 --> 01:17:44.038]  I was wondering whether you or Mr. Watson have been checking out King Star Demolition Services at all yet.
[01:17:46.618 --> 01:17:47.699]  You said Kingstar?
[01:17:47.959 --> 01:17:48.159]  Yes.
[01:17:49.820 --> 01:18:00.569]  It's a demolition company, and surprisingly enough, if you look at the picture of the bus exploding, the one that blew up in London, there are vans parked right next to it.
[01:18:01.870 --> 01:18:02.790]  It's in all the pictures.
[01:18:02.810 --> 01:18:05.593]  It's called Kingstar Demolition Services.
[01:18:07.374 --> 01:18:08.155]  Definitely check it out.
[01:18:08.795 --> 01:18:12.658]  Well, you know, the bus said, Terror, Brilliant.
[01:18:13.359 --> 01:18:13.679]  Excuse me?
[01:18:14.324 --> 01:18:18.547]  The bus had a sign on it saying, saying, terrorism, brilliant.
[01:18:19.107 --> 01:18:19.488]  Oh, really?
[01:18:19.508 --> 01:18:25.872]  I didn't see that, but right next to it, it looks like it got stuck in the traffic.
[01:18:25.912 --> 01:18:28.333]  There's a van that says Kingstar.
[01:18:28.994 --> 01:18:34.978]  It says Kingstar on it, and somebody on Club Conspiracy checked it out, and it's a demolition company.
[01:18:35.758 --> 01:18:37.780]  I just thought that was strange.
[01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:41.943]  I was wondering if maybe that's the named company from Peter Power's...
[01:18:43.916 --> 01:18:47.378]  Stay there, Don.
[01:18:48.059 --> 01:18:49.199]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:18:49.219 --> 01:18:51.321]  A lot of news, a lot of your calls, straight ahead.
[01:18:53.653 --> 01:18:56.696]  Gano Café is the new energy drink that's sweeping the globe.
[01:18:56.936 --> 01:19:02.582]  Already a number one beverage in Asia, Gano Café is the new energy drink for coffee, tea, and cocoa lovers.
[01:19:02.882 --> 01:19:08.748]  What makes Gano Café special is the secret ingredient, reishi, a concentration of six species of red mushroom.
[01:19:08.868 --> 01:19:14.834]  Also known as a miraculous king of herbs, known for its high nutritional value, reishi packs a bigger punch than ginseng.
[01:19:15.154 --> 01:19:18.838]  One packet of Gano Cafe is the energy equivalent of a whole pot of coffee.
[01:19:19.018 --> 01:19:23.823]  All-natural Gano Cafe tastes great and is a drug-free alternative for optimal health and longevity.
[01:19:23.984 --> 01:19:31.552]  With several delicious varieties, including mocha, hot cocoa, and the Brazilian coffee classic, you can experience Gano Cafe for yourself.

[01:19:54.784 --> 01:19:55.826]  The war on terrorism.
[01:19:56.146 --> 01:19:58.930]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:19:59.210 --> 01:20:03.376]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:20:03.796 --> 01:20:04.637]  So what do you do?
[01:20:04.938 --> 01:20:09.504]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:20:09.984 --> 01:20:10.585]  We're good to go.
[01:20:10.625 --> 01:20:10.865]  I think?
[01:20:34.765 --> 01:20:39.167]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[01:20:39.607 --> 01:20:41.367]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[01:20:41.387 --> 01:20:41.587]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:20:41.607 --> 01:20:42.908]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:20:42.948 --> 01:20:44.989]  Currency devaluation, inflation, one and the same.
[01:20:58.957 --> 01:21:04.002]  If you have deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:21:04.022 --> 01:21:05.824]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:21:05.864 --> 01:21:06.705]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:21:06.765 --> 01:21:08.427]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:21:22.891 --> 01:21:23.751]  Here is reality.
[01:21:23.771 --> 01:21:27.693]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:21:28.793 --> 01:21:32.474]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:21:33.214 --> 01:21:37.096]  Gold, in the same time frame, increased 35% in value.
[01:21:37.896 --> 01:21:41.637]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.
[01:21:42.197 --> 01:21:43.678]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:43.718 --> 01:21:43.958]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:52.858 --> 01:21:53.198]  We're good to go.
[01:21:53.738 --> 01:21:54.019]  I think?
[01:22:13.647 --> 01:22:18.572]  Because Zango is made from the whole mangosteen fruit, it delivers a serious nutrient-packed punch.
[01:22:18.852 --> 01:22:30.844]  Loaded with xanthones, which are some of the most powerful antioxidants ever found, fighting hard to support microbiological balance, maintain immune system health, promote joint flexibility, and provide positive mental support and so much more.
[01:22:31.064 --> 01:22:37.090]  Now you can experience the whole fruit goodness of the mangosteen with Zango, the original mangosteen functional health beverage.
[01:22:37.230 --> 01:22:39.891]  I want to read an article that Steve Watson wrote over the weekend that I think
[01:23:06.431 --> 01:23:07.412]  Crystallizes.
[01:23:09.874 --> 01:23:16.501]  Crystallizes a lot of the questions we have concerning the London bombings.
[01:23:17.342 --> 01:23:20.084]  And then we will get into what the EU is up to.
[01:23:20.144 --> 01:23:23.227]  They're expanding regardless of what the people want, as we predicted they would.
[01:23:23.708 --> 01:23:24.709]  Wasn't hard to predict that.
[01:23:25.522 --> 01:23:27.223]  And just so much more.
[01:23:27.263 --> 01:23:29.884]  But right now, let's go back to Don in Ohio.
[01:23:29.944 --> 01:23:31.464]  Don, you had another point you wanted to make?
[01:23:31.864 --> 01:23:33.525]  Oh, yeah.
[01:23:33.845 --> 01:23:40.448]  That information came from Club Conspiracy, Dr. Macau's site, Save the Males.
[01:23:40.888 --> 01:23:42.068]  Yeah, Aaron Macau.
[01:23:42.368 --> 01:23:42.548]  Right.
[01:23:42.948 --> 01:23:45.649]  Okay, I also like to promote my site.
[01:23:45.950 --> 01:23:49.711]  If you Google ebook vaults,
[01:23:50.643 --> 01:23:53.065]  All right, anything else, Don?
[01:23:53.405 --> 01:23:54.005]  Nope, that's it.
[01:23:54.045 --> 01:23:55.066]  Thank you for the call.
[01:24:14.801 --> 01:24:16.023]  All right, Ron in New York.
[01:24:16.063 --> 01:24:16.884]  I'm moving quick here.
[01:24:16.984 --> 01:24:17.704]  Ron, go ahead.
[01:24:17.724 --> 01:24:18.525]  Hi, Alex.
[01:24:18.986 --> 01:24:24.092]  Another report about the wonderful growing freedoms in our new Stalinistic, fascistic country.
[01:24:25.069 --> 01:24:33.875]  It turns out that the FBI is keeping dossiers and files... On everybody and every major political movement who ever protests anything.
[01:24:34.496 --> 01:24:35.096]  That's freedom.
[01:24:35.116 --> 01:24:36.497]  That defines democracy.
[01:24:36.677 --> 01:24:38.439]  And that's meant to be a chilling effect.
[01:24:38.839 --> 01:24:39.099]  Right.
[01:24:39.179 --> 01:24:42.522]  Even the ACLU and other such al-Qaeda-related organizations.
[01:24:42.542 --> 01:24:46.585]  In other words, they're keeping tabs on organizations that have nothing to do with terrorism.
[01:24:47.245 --> 01:24:47.886]  Good, good.
[01:24:47.926 --> 01:24:51.728]  We're keeping tabs on them because they are a terrorist organization.
[01:24:51.748 --> 01:24:53.830]  Look, we shouldn't let this intimidate us.
[01:24:54.585 --> 01:24:56.786]  Let them have 50 million people on a list.
[01:24:57.206 --> 01:25:05.789]  We run this country, this is our country, and you're the ones that leave the border wide open while you're busy spying on the Republicans and the Democrats.
[01:25:05.809 --> 01:25:06.209]  Go ahead.
[01:25:06.569 --> 01:25:08.150]  Well, they don't like being transparent.
[01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:11.090]  I thought Nixon got in trouble for spying on the Democrats.
[01:25:11.451 --> 01:25:14.832]  Yes, yes, he did, but I guess that's when we had more of an America.
[01:25:15.772 --> 01:25:21.614]  And another thing is in the city of New York, the health commissioner now wants a name-specific, it's a very eugenic health commissioner,
[01:25:22.213 --> 01:25:25.134]  Name specific database of people who have diabetes.
[01:25:26.435 --> 01:25:32.858]  Now, of course, one can only wonder why would the man want to know the specific names of people who have diabetes in the city of New York?
[01:25:33.258 --> 01:25:35.319]  Especially being he's not going to do anything to help them.
[01:25:35.679 --> 01:25:38.060]  He just wants to snoop around and know who's got diabetes.
[01:25:39.561 --> 01:25:44.043]  Well, a lot of it is just... That's the pretext.
[01:25:44.523 --> 01:25:49.185]  The federal money is now in New York, Dallas, Houston, Chicago, everywhere.
[01:25:49.921 --> 01:25:54.044]  To put in these huge snooping systems openly.
[01:25:54.705 --> 01:25:58.167]  So they admit that everything you do is going to be going in a database.
[01:25:58.247 --> 01:25:59.128]  Good.
[01:25:59.448 --> 01:26:03.671]  Even your health, even your glucose level is now their business.
[01:26:03.891 --> 01:26:18.182]  I mean, Ron, you know that right before 9-11, they started this deal where every prescription you get, whether it's for a diaphragm or for prescription-strength Advil, ibuprofen,
[01:26:18.886 --> 01:26:21.848]  It all goes instantly into a federal database.
[01:26:22.229 --> 01:26:24.330]  Now, where is the Fourth Amendment there, folks?
[01:26:25.311 --> 01:26:31.435]  I mean, if you don't have a Fourth Amendment right in relation to the glucose in your body, then where does the Fourth Amendment begin?
[01:26:31.456 --> 01:26:34.378]  And, you know, I mean, it's obvious what they're doing.
[01:26:34.438 --> 01:26:45.226]  They'll pull these things into, like, a government database, and then the government, which is married in this corporatist system, I guess you could call it fascism, let's call it fascism, that's what it is,
[01:26:45.806 --> 01:26:46.066]  All right.
[01:26:46.346 --> 01:26:54.150]  We'll then turn around and regurgitate this information to corporations, I guess things like insurance companies and so forth.
[01:26:54.190 --> 01:26:55.931]  Well, it's a giant endless circle.
[01:26:55.971 --> 01:26:57.832]  They all regurgitate back and forth.
[01:26:58.272 --> 01:26:58.912]  That's correct.
[01:26:58.972 --> 01:27:05.315]  As a matter of fact, do you know that New York City, it may even also be used for this, you're not allowed to have a pistol permit if you have diabetes?
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:06.760]  You know that?
[01:27:07.041 --> 01:27:07.741]  I didn't know that.
[01:27:07.961 --> 01:27:09.583]  Yeah, that's part of their administrative rule.
[01:27:09.603 --> 01:27:18.250]  Now, I would like for somebody, reasonably speaking, to show me the correlation, how one thing is related to the other, but... Well, diabetes may be connected to Al-Qaeda.
[01:27:18.270 --> 01:27:18.951]  Thanks for the call.
[01:27:19.751 --> 01:27:20.772]  Let's talk to Mike.
[01:27:21.273 --> 01:27:22.494]  Mike in Canada.
[01:27:22.514 --> 01:27:22.914]  Go ahead.
[01:27:22.934 --> 01:27:26.417]  Hello?
[01:27:26.817 --> 01:27:27.318]  Yes, sir.
[01:27:27.358 --> 01:27:27.958]  You're on the air.
[01:27:27.998 --> 01:27:28.319]  Welcome.
[01:27:28.559 --> 01:27:29.740]  Oh, okay.
[01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:34.564]  I went to Universal Studios in June, early June.
[01:27:35.091 --> 01:27:47.855]  And I went from I-75 down the I-4, and from there to the exit for Universal Studios, I counted 17 cameras in the middle lane, just all along there.
[01:27:47.875 --> 01:28:04.320]  And not only do they have the hand scan for when you go for the annual cardholders for the park, but they also have a finger scan for lockers for the mummy ride.
[01:28:05.222 --> 01:28:12.344]  In order to go on the ride, you can't take your bag on with you, but they have free lockers over there, and you have to finger scan for it.
[01:28:13.225 --> 01:28:21.467]  You know, I wish folks would go to Universal Studios and go to Epcot Center and get me photos and video of this and send it to me.
[01:28:22.008 --> 01:28:27.369]  You know, I tried to go to SeaWorld three years ago, and you've got to hand them a scan to get in.
[01:28:28.510 --> 01:28:29.830]  And it's despicable.
[01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:31.691]  I totally agree with you, sir.
[01:28:31.751 --> 01:28:32.251]  Anything else?
[01:28:32.771 --> 01:28:36.817]  Oh yeah, I wanted to tell you about Inside the Mommy Ride, this weird thing that they have.
[01:28:37.498 --> 01:28:39.921]  Okay, tell me more about the freedom when we get back.
[01:28:43.486 --> 01:28:44.407]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.908 --> 01:28:46.510]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.411 --> 01:28:50.115]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:54.688 --> 01:31:01.537]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[01:31:01.817 --> 01:31:04.180]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:06.383]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[01:31:06.743 --> 01:31:12.090]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[01:31:12.450 --> 01:31:16.733]  The keychain-attachable nuke alert was specifically designed to meet this critical crisis need.
[01:31:17.193 --> 01:31:25.098]  Small, portable, and on 24 hours a day with its 10-year battery, the nuke alert is always with you to alert you to dangerous levels of radiation.
[01:31:25.278 --> 01:31:30.322]  The patented nuke alert has even passed the rigorous military EMP test and has been acquired by the U.S.
[01:31:30.362 --> 01:31:32.363]  military and numerous other government agencies.
[01:31:32.863 --> 01:31:36.025]  See the Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert at nukealert.com.

[01:31:47.972 --> 01:31:50.173]  Or call 830-672-8734.
[01:31:54.236 --> 01:31:56.997]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:31:57.017 --> 01:32:00.840]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:07.742 --> 01:32:10.163]  Talking about problem, reaction, solution.
[01:32:10.203 --> 01:32:14.886]  They flood Europe and England with masses of illegal aliens.
[01:32:16.467 --> 01:32:20.129]  Then the government carries out terror attacks, blames it on Muslims.
[01:32:20.969 --> 01:32:26.572]  But then if anybody gets mad at Muslims, even calls them a racial name, you are arrested.
[01:32:27.653 --> 01:32:29.834]  Blair vows anti-hate reforms.
[01:32:30.434 --> 01:32:35.317]  Investigators anxious to identify fifth man seen with bombers.
[01:32:37.375 --> 01:32:38.776]  How is that even tied together?
[01:32:39.897 --> 01:32:42.158]  And look at the climate.
[01:32:42.278 --> 01:32:45.020]  Blair's approval rating up by 12 points.
[01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:47.682]  Bush's approval rating up by over 10 points.
[01:32:48.642 --> 01:32:53.545]  Terror laws face easy ride in climate of cooperation.
[01:32:55.247 --> 01:32:56.928]  And here it is, the Washington Post.
[01:32:57.008 --> 01:32:58.649]  Ron just mentioned it in the last segment.
[01:32:59.189 --> 01:33:03.132]  FBI monitoring websites for 2004 protests.
[01:33:03.652 --> 01:33:06.714]  Groups criticize agency surveillance for terror unit.
[01:33:07.449 --> 01:33:09.412]  So we'll get into that here in just a few minutes.
[01:33:09.893 --> 01:33:13.598]  Right now, let's let Mike finish up.
[01:33:13.698 --> 01:33:15.200]  So you went to Universal Studios.
[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:23.171]  I knew that almost all of the major carnival-type amusement parks...
[01:33:24.850 --> 01:33:28.433]  I have read that Universal Studios had done it, though I haven't seen photos of it.
[01:33:28.453 --> 01:33:30.395]  I know Disney World has done it.
[01:33:30.475 --> 01:33:32.637]  I know that the SeaWorld has done it.
[01:33:33.037 --> 01:33:34.098]  Disneyland.
[01:33:34.939 --> 01:33:38.142]  Some of the Six Flags are now doing it.
[01:33:38.202 --> 01:33:38.802]  And that's it.
[01:33:39.383 --> 01:33:42.786]  Alex Jones will never go to one of those again in his life.
[01:33:43.266 --> 01:33:46.950]  It's not very hard because I never liked him to begin with, even as a child.
[01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:51.942]  I remember going to those and thinking they were kind of boring and that they were just big crowds of people.
[01:33:52.022 --> 01:34:08.851]  I mean, I'd much rather walk around in the woods when I was ten years old with a deer rifle stalking wild hogs, or I'd much rather go water skiing, or I'd much rather go hiking up a mountain or stargazing than being at some mindless park with a bunch of idiots.
[01:34:09.511 --> 01:34:11.092]  All right, there I go.
[01:34:11.132 --> 01:34:12.513]  I'm trying to be calm today.
[01:34:12.533 --> 01:34:14.274]  I'm starting to rant.
[01:34:15.208 --> 01:34:20.190]  I just wanted to see if for one day I could be calm for the full three hours.
[01:34:20.290 --> 01:34:21.851]  And we're going to see if that happens today.
[01:34:23.171 --> 01:34:25.212]  There, I've announced what I'm attempting to do today.
[01:34:26.352 --> 01:34:27.513]  Keeping myself in check.
[01:34:27.613 --> 01:34:32.355]  But, yeah, going with the family to SeaWorld.
[01:34:34.176 --> 01:34:38.857]  And, oh, it's 50-something dollars if you just want to come in one time.
[01:34:40.258 --> 01:34:40.998]  Or it's $40 for a...
[01:34:44.267 --> 01:34:45.368]  Six-month pass.
[01:34:45.808 --> 01:34:46.668]  Which do you want?
[01:34:47.429 --> 01:34:51.431]  Well, only a fool would, you know, pay more to get in once.
[01:34:53.212 --> 01:34:58.834]  Why the discount if you'll hand scan, a biometric scan of your entire hand?
[01:35:00.975 --> 01:35:02.176]  And I got the video interview.
[01:35:02.216 --> 01:35:03.257]  In fact, it's on... It's on...
[01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:08.411]  Infowars.com.
[01:35:08.431 --> 01:35:10.592]  We need to get that posted in the video section.
[01:35:11.012 --> 01:35:14.834]  So much of that website is, like, hidden off in, you know, ancient archives.
[01:35:14.854 --> 01:35:20.517]  We need to have somebody go through it and find all the cool video and stuff we put on there and put it all in one area.
[01:35:21.978 --> 01:35:25.620]  And I talked to the lady, and she said, Oh, yeah, most people don't like it, but they still do it.
[01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:35.185]  And so the caller, Mike in Canada, was bringing up that...
[01:35:37.397 --> 01:35:38.358]  They were doing the same thing.
[01:35:38.378 --> 01:35:42.221]  But then to get your free locker, you've got a fingerprint as well.
[01:35:42.921 --> 01:35:45.444]  All of this trains you for this casual society.
[01:35:45.944 --> 01:35:52.029]  And now the health clubs, the bars, the tanning salons, the grocery stores.
[01:35:52.530 --> 01:35:59.296]  Oh, you get a 15% discount if you're a trusted cardholder at this grocery store, but you've got a thumbprint.
[01:35:59.556 --> 01:36:00.897]  I guess I will then.
[01:36:01.518 --> 01:36:03.339]  And then in a few years, you won't get the discount.
[01:36:03.379 --> 01:36:04.280]  It'll just be everybody.
[01:36:04.989 --> 01:36:07.090]  And then it brings that total control.
[01:36:07.850 --> 01:36:08.731]  Is Mike still there?
[01:36:11.292 --> 01:36:12.953]  Mike, you wanted to finish up saying something?
[01:36:13.513 --> 01:36:14.354]  Oh, yeah.
[01:36:14.854 --> 01:36:22.878]  All the while of walking through the corridors of the mummy ride, you see all these Egyptian symbols all over the place and all seeing eyes everywhere.
[01:36:22.898 --> 01:36:28.201]  Of course, I'm wearing my government-sponsored terror shirt that I got from PropagandaMatrix.com.
[01:36:28.921 --> 01:36:30.102]  And in the middle, there's...
[01:36:31.331 --> 01:36:37.516]  When you're walking through the corridors, walking through the line, there's a big box with a pyramid on top, and it's got these Egyptian shapes.
[01:36:37.997 --> 01:36:43.921]  Well, the one that you see is an all-seeing eye, and below that is just the metal hand that does nothing.
[01:36:43.981 --> 01:36:44.962]  It's just sitting there.
[01:36:44.982 --> 01:36:48.645]  I just watched as all these people walked up and put their hand on it.
[01:36:48.745 --> 01:36:51.368]  It didn't do anything, but they all just were conditioned.
[01:36:51.388 --> 01:37:00.175]  They saw it, and they put their hand on it, and I felt it was weird with the all-seeing eye on top of it, and I was freaked out by the whole thing, and actually the whole park.
[01:37:00.638 --> 01:37:06.662]  I always thought of your SeaWorld video clip in the back of my mind as I was going through that place.
[01:37:08.884 --> 01:37:23.033]  Well, I appreciate the call, and I would hope that listeners, when you go to SeaWorld or you go to Epcot Center, Disney World, or you go to Disneyland or you go to Six Flags, have your camera on.
[01:37:23.053 --> 01:37:24.314]  They're used to cameras being on.
[01:37:24.334 --> 01:37:28.897]  Have it down by your waist, kind of aiming at the person and say, well, why are you doing this?
[01:37:29.597 --> 01:37:30.318]  What's this for?
[01:37:31.198 --> 01:37:32.559]  Please send it to me.
[01:37:33.599 --> 01:37:42.482]  I mean, as much as I'd enjoy flying around the country to go to different amusement parks to do this, I just can't make time to do it.
[01:37:44.283 --> 01:37:46.684]  It's not a good thing to do with my time.
[01:37:47.464 --> 01:37:48.725]  There's better ways to spend my time.
[01:37:48.765 --> 01:37:57.488]  But if you're already going to these FEMA camps and training, then please, by all means, let there be a silver lining to this.
[01:37:58.260 --> 01:38:11.024]  And you know, I was thinking during the break, so many broadcasts I do, I get all sped up, I get all upset, I want to cover it all, there's just so many angles I want to discuss, and I get pretty obnoxious.
[01:38:13.145 --> 01:38:15.346]  But really, there's no way to cover it all.
[01:38:16.087 --> 01:38:17.908]  I mean, to cover really much of it.
[01:38:17.948 --> 01:38:23.129]  I mean, if I turn the nightly news on, each newscast is so laced with propaganda.
[01:38:23.509 --> 01:38:29.511]  If I watch a sitcom, it's just jam-packed from pillar to post with brainwashing.
[01:38:32.352 --> 01:38:37.874]  I mean, the society is just bathed, basted, marinated in all of this.
[01:38:40.215 --> 01:38:43.636]  All right, this next clip is Simon Aranowitz's.
[01:38:44.662 --> 01:38:48.644]  This is up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[01:38:50.664 --> 01:38:56.947]  Simon Aranowicz goes out Thursday to the 7th day anniversary there in downtown London of the bombings.
[01:38:56.967 --> 01:39:02.889]  They've got all these government officials and authorities there and the servants, the people where they're worshipping them.
[01:39:03.169 --> 01:39:03.929]  We are the slaves.
[01:39:03.969 --> 01:39:04.690]  We are the subjects.
[01:39:05.110 --> 01:39:05.890]  We are the servants.
[01:39:06.530 --> 01:39:10.432]  And they have these big signs, One London, One World.
[01:39:12.621 --> 01:39:28.193]  And then as the crowd breaks off, Simon goes and talks to two prominent members of Parliament, and here he is, that exchange, as they really try to walk away from him, and he follows them with the camera through traffic and the crowds.
[01:39:28.493 --> 01:39:29.614]  He did a pretty good job.
[01:39:30.314 --> 01:39:32.336]  So here is the audio of that exchange.
[01:39:32.896 --> 01:39:34.838]  Can I ask you a couple of quick questions, if you'll be okay?
[01:39:34.858 --> 01:39:35.058]  Yeah.
[01:39:35.118 --> 01:39:35.238]  Okay.
[01:39:35.298 --> 01:39:36.459]  Simon is Mr. Anchor, isn't he?
[01:39:36.479 --> 01:39:36.879]  He is, yes.
[01:39:36.919 --> 01:39:37.239]  All right.
[01:39:41.371 --> 01:39:44.913]  Who really benefits from these bombs, Mr. Anchorim?
[01:39:45.013 --> 01:39:56.841]  It depends how the public... Do you mind if I ask a couple of good questions as we're walking?
[01:39:56.981 --> 01:39:57.321]  Yeah.
[01:39:57.381 --> 01:39:57.522]  Okay.
[01:39:57.602 --> 01:39:58.382]  Simon Aronowitz.
[01:39:58.442 --> 01:40:01.124]  Independent media is Mr. Anchorim, isn't it?
[01:40:01.224 --> 01:40:02.305]  It is, yes.
[01:40:02.325 --> 01:40:04.186]  Who really benefits from these bombs, Mr. Anchorim?
[01:40:05.939 --> 01:40:08.801]  It depends how the public and the country react to them.
[01:40:09.081 --> 01:40:19.546]  But if it brings us together and it teaches us that it's only by talking to each other and understanding each other that we can avoid this terrorism in the future, then it will have done good.
[01:40:19.926 --> 01:40:25.289]  But doesn't it play into the hands of the people who want to bring in ID cards and want to clamp down on our civil liberties?
[01:40:25.329 --> 01:40:32.993]  I think it's very important that we don't allow ourselves to be pushed by an event like this into overreacting.
[01:40:34.628 --> 01:40:40.791]  Liberty and freedom only matters if it's not undermined in order to try and protect it.
[01:40:40.811 --> 01:40:44.553]  But if we take our freedoms away, then we're doing the work of Osama for him, actually.
[01:40:44.573 --> 01:40:51.136]  This is why we've got to be very careful and we've got to look very closely at whatever is proposed to ensure that we don't do that.
[01:40:51.156 --> 01:40:55.898]  These bombings, don't they actually play into the neoconservative agenda, though?
[01:40:55.938 --> 01:41:00.601]  The bombs play into the agenda of those who wish to divide our society and we must not allow that to happen.
[01:41:04.164 --> 01:41:11.670]  Well, I think everyone accepts that these matters are questions of balance, mind your back.
[01:41:11.690 --> 01:41:14.632]  The problem is precisely where you strike the balance.
[01:41:25.141 --> 01:41:31.766]  Anti-terrorist legislation by its nature inevitably means there will be some curtailment of personal freedom.
[01:41:31.886 --> 01:41:51.403]  What we have to ensure is that any such legislation only affects individual liberties to the minimum extent that is necessary for the purpose of protecting the citizens against outrages of the kind that's all out there.
[01:41:52.668 --> 01:41:54.949]  Have the Lib Dems changed their policy on ID cards?
[01:41:54.969 --> 01:42:10.438]  No, our view on identity cards is well known and we've had some support and confirmation of that view because the Home Secretary himself said last week that there is no evidence that ID cards would have prevented a vote race.
[01:42:13.232 --> 01:42:24.240]  And indeed, if it is the case that these bombs were planted by poor British citizens, then of course what we know is that they would undoubtedly have had valid identity cards.
[01:42:24.801 --> 01:42:27.002]  And it wouldn't have stopped them?
[01:42:27.202 --> 01:42:29.624]  Unlikely to have inhibited them.
[01:42:29.644 --> 01:42:34.928]  Can I just ask you both finally, did you hear about the drill that Visor Consultants were supposed to be running last Thursday?
[01:42:36.179 --> 01:42:43.864]  A drill run by visor consultants, Peter Power, formerly of Scotland Yard, where they were going to simulate the bombings at the exact same three tube stations.
[01:42:43.904 --> 01:42:46.266]  He was on Five Live last Thursday telling us.
[01:42:46.286 --> 01:42:48.407]  Well, that's one of these remarkable coincidences.
[01:42:48.467 --> 01:42:49.328]  A remarkable coincidence.
[01:42:49.348 --> 01:42:50.629]  You don't think there's anything more than that?
[01:42:50.649 --> 01:42:53.731]  Maybe the terrorists have found out and piggybacked on top?
[01:42:53.771 --> 01:42:54.111]  No, no.
[01:42:55.592 --> 01:42:58.754]  I believe in coincidence rather than conspiracy.
[01:42:59.234 --> 01:42:59.515]  Right.
[01:42:59.555 --> 01:42:59.635]  OK.
[01:42:59.715 --> 01:43:00.235]  Thanks, gentlemen.
[01:43:03.439 --> 01:43:06.180]  My friends, that is one noisy city.
[01:43:07.741 --> 01:43:17.426]  But the video is more powerful because when he asked that Member of Parliament that final question, I mean, the light goes on and the guy looks scared.
[01:43:19.547 --> 01:43:23.628]  But notice the false pretext or the false choice they give you.
[01:43:24.349 --> 01:43:28.311]  Oh, it depends on how much liberty you want to give up or how much security you get.
[01:43:28.331 --> 01:43:30.952]  We need to strike a balance, my friends.
[01:43:31.661 --> 01:43:35.042]  You know the saying, when you give up liberty, you don't get security, you get tyranny.
[01:43:35.062 --> 01:43:37.182]  I mean, that's just common sense.
[01:43:40.043 --> 01:43:43.884]  Our governments are doing nothing to protect us from terrorism.
[01:43:45.764 --> 01:43:59.467]  Even if you buy the fact that these terrorists are attacking us because they're really independent Muslims that don't like us, well, why aren't they attacking us?
[01:44:01.403 --> 01:44:02.843]  You know, South Africa.
[01:44:02.943 --> 01:44:04.404]  Why aren't they attacking Canada?
[01:44:04.864 --> 01:44:06.364]  Why aren't they attacking Mexico?
[01:44:06.764 --> 01:44:09.144]  Because those countries don't have troops in their countries.
[01:44:09.584 --> 01:44:11.865]  Those countries aren't overturning their governments.
[01:44:13.465 --> 01:44:18.586]  And believe me, those countries will sell Mexico and South Africa and Canada oil.
[01:44:20.746 --> 01:44:28.668]  So even if you buy the fraud of its real Muslims independently carrying out terror, well then why are they attacking us to begin with?
[01:44:28.928 --> 01:44:30.548]  But again, all of that's a fraud.
[01:44:32.472 --> 01:44:41.305]  Why would the Muslims carry out attacks knowing it will bring the wrath down on them and give the private interests that control our government exactly what they want?
[01:44:44.429 --> 01:44:50.133]  And of course, the London Times reported that MI5 judged the bomber to be no threat.
[01:44:50.654 --> 01:45:02.462]  One of the four suicide terrorists, see now it's just a suicide terrorist, behind the London bomb attacks was scrutinized by MI5 last year, but was judged not to be a threat to national security.
[01:45:02.843 --> 01:45:12.650]  A senior government official said yesterday, as a result, MI5 failed to put him under surveillance, and his plan to become a suicide bomber remained undetected.
[01:45:14.426 --> 01:45:15.467]  What about the big question?
[01:45:16.047 --> 01:45:17.908]  Timers on bombs are quite easy.
[01:45:18.948 --> 01:45:23.270]  Why would they all commit suicide if they could have just left the bombs on board the trains?
[01:45:26.692 --> 01:45:38.397]  Mohammed Khan, a 30-year-old teaching assistant from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, who killed six other passengers when he blew himself up on the tube at Edgeware Road.
[01:45:38.717 --> 01:45:40.018]  Well, he's convicted now, folks.
[01:45:40.058 --> 01:45:40.438]  He did it.
[01:45:41.358 --> 01:45:48.481]  Was the subject of a routine threat assessment by MI5 officers after his name cropped up during an investigation in 2004.
[01:45:50.081 --> 01:45:50.721]  Yeah, right.
[01:45:52.742 --> 01:45:58.244]  Again, the British government, they've all been caught carrying out terror before and blaming it on their enemies.
[01:45:59.244 --> 01:46:00.485]  I'll tell you what I want to do now.
[01:46:00.505 --> 01:46:03.046]  I want to get into...
[01:46:05.126 --> 01:46:11.512]  British media are beginning to tentatively question official line on bombings.
[01:46:12.773 --> 01:46:15.996]  We have the London Independent and the Mirror doing that.
[01:46:16.016 --> 01:46:20.420]  I also want to read this article that Steve Watson wrote.
[01:46:22.161 --> 01:46:29.247]  And then I want to get off into the European Union, where, again, the people have voted it down, but they're saying, you know what, we don't care.
[01:46:29.728 --> 01:46:32.110]  We're just going to do what we want, how we want, when we want.
[01:46:33.812 --> 01:46:34.873]  And then more of your calls.
[01:46:35.533 --> 01:46:40.315]  But before I do that, look, I get sick of plugging my videos.
[01:46:41.296 --> 01:46:47.298]  Though that is really the only form of support that I have.
[01:46:48.539 --> 01:46:51.040]  My documentary films are excellent.
[01:46:51.881 --> 01:46:52.761]  They're informative.
[01:46:52.981 --> 01:46:54.362]  They're full of information.
[01:46:54.922 --> 01:46:56.523]  They've woken a lot of people up.
[01:46:56.603 --> 01:47:00.385]  They have been widely acclaimed as being very good.
[01:47:01.865 --> 01:47:02.906]  I'm my own worst critic.
[01:47:03.450 --> 01:47:05.111]  But, you know, these are good videos.
[01:47:06.953 --> 01:47:13.477]  And it is really a secondary issue that your purchase of the videos makes this broadcast possible.
[01:47:14.498 --> 01:47:21.063]  But I assure you, here where the rubber meets the road, it is a central issue.
[01:47:23.144 --> 01:47:26.547]  So, remember, that's a reason to get the videos.
[01:47:26.667 --> 01:47:29.629]  I know a lot of you know all about the New World Order.
[01:47:30.729 --> 01:47:39.514]  Many of you are more intelligent and more eloquent than I. And so you say to yourself, well, why do I need those videos?
[01:47:39.634 --> 01:47:41.235]  I've seen everything he talks about.
[01:47:41.295 --> 01:47:41.735]  I've read it.
[01:47:41.815 --> 01:47:42.235]  I know it.
[01:47:42.636 --> 01:47:43.896]  I've seen the government documents.
[01:47:43.956 --> 01:47:44.657]  Yes, it's true.
[01:47:45.077 --> 01:47:48.499]  Why do I need a video that exposes government complicity in 9-11?
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:52.321]  Well, number one, we never know it all.
[01:47:53.462 --> 01:47:56.063]  The more you learn, the more you find out that you don't know.
[01:47:58.474 --> 01:48:00.876]  And more importantly, it's waking people up.
[01:48:01.436 --> 01:48:09.300]  Those of us that are informed and know what's happening need informative, well-produced tools to get that job done.
[01:48:09.420 --> 01:48:22.148]  And frankly, out of all the 9-11 videos I've seen, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, and Martial Law are the two best videos out there for exposing government complicity in 9-11.
[01:48:22.488 --> 01:48:24.069]  We don't just show how they did it.
[01:48:24.801 --> 01:48:28.905]  We also show their motive and the big picture and what their master plan is.
[01:48:28.965 --> 01:48:30.767]  So please get Road to Tyranny.
[01:48:30.867 --> 01:48:33.910]  Please get Martial Law, my newest film.
[01:48:34.270 --> 01:48:39.695]  Get American Dictators that exposes the phony left-right paradigm and shows you how both parties are controlled.
[01:48:40.676 --> 01:48:46.242]  You can get some of my videos as low as $5.95 apiece when you get some of the other videos.
[01:48:46.969 --> 01:48:54.515]  We have a bunch of different specials, just really great specials, and I hope you will take advantage of those.
[01:48:55.035 --> 01:49:02.681]  Go to Infowars.com to get the videos on VHS or DVD, or simply call toll-free to get them, 1-888-253-3139.
[01:49:10.239 --> 01:49:12.020]  They're all full-length feature films.
[01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:16.342]  You're authorized and encouraged to make copies of them for non-profit educational purposes.
[01:49:16.382 --> 01:49:20.745]  I want to thank those that have gotten the films and have supported us and those that have made copies.
[01:49:21.145 --> 01:49:24.287]  If you've gotten the films and haven't made copies yet, what's keeping you?
[01:49:25.467 --> 01:49:26.708]  Again, here's the toll-free number.
[01:49:27.569 --> 01:49:31.171]  These criminals that have carried out 9-11, folks, must be exposed.
[01:49:31.191 --> 01:49:35.233]  1-888-253-3139 is the toll-free number to order.

[01:49:53.419 --> 01:49:54.960]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:58.201]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.341 --> 01:50:02.242]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.282 --> 01:50:06.523]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:50:06.863 --> 01:50:10.624]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:10.784 --> 01:50:12.565]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:12.785 --> 01:50:16.107]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[01:50:16.127 --> 01:50:20.830]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:20.990 --> 01:50:24.052]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[01:50:24.213 --> 01:50:27.074]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:27.575 --> 01:50:33.699]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.219 --> 01:50:36.060]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[01:50:54.206 --> 01:50:55.026]  We're good to go.
[01:51:12.597 --> 01:51:13.857]  To below detectable levels.
[01:51:14.138 --> 01:51:18.059]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[01:51:18.299 --> 01:51:24.821]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:51:25.041 --> 01:51:30.523]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:30.763 --> 01:51:37.710]  The Berkey light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[01:51:37.910 --> 01:51:43.175]  Get the Berkey light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:51:49.902 --> 01:51:51.183]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[01:51:56.876 --> 01:51:57.776]  No more imagining.

[01:52:14.421 --> 01:52:17.582]  The Total Health Spa begins with the original and only G-Machine.
[01:52:17.722 --> 01:52:29.090]  The T-Machine, which is a FDA-regulated as a Class I medical device, maximizes the movement of the body, which helps to provide relief through increased oxygen levels, allowing a sense of extreme comfort and pleasure.

[01:53:04.927 --> 01:53:09.329]  We're going to be opening the phones up in the next hour again for those that are patiently holding.
[01:53:09.810 --> 01:53:14.932]  Or if you'd like to get involved on air, it's 1-800-259-9231.
[01:53:16.893 --> 01:53:21.996]  London bombings, web of deceit, Peter Power, the terror drill, Giuliani and the CIA.
[01:53:23.416 --> 01:53:24.376]  By Steve Watson.
[01:53:25.037 --> 01:53:41.523]  As we revealed last week, on the very morning of the bombings, a consultancy agency with government and police connections was running an exercise for an unnamed company that revolved around the London Underground being bombed at the exact same times and locations.
[01:53:42.723 --> 01:53:46.685]  On a BBC Radio 5 interview that aired on the evening of the 7th,
[01:53:47.617 --> 01:54:02.620]  The host interviewed Peter Power, a former Scotland Yard official working at one time with the anti-terrorism branch and now managing director of Visor Consultants, which builds itself as a crisis management advice company.
[01:54:03.900 --> 01:54:16.743]  Beyond the unbelievable coincidence of this scenario, the very fact that the bombs and the drills were simultaneous is a smoking gun because almost a week went by before it was revealed that the bombs had gone off
[01:54:18.189 --> 01:54:19.311]  Simultaneously.
[01:54:20.693 --> 01:54:23.596]  The importance of the drill cannot be understated.
[01:54:23.616 --> 01:54:26.280]  This is precisely what happened on the morning of 9-11.
[01:54:26.861 --> 01:54:32.929]  The CIA was conducting drills of flying hijacked planes at the WTC and Pentagon at 8-30 in the morning.
[01:54:33.689 --> 01:54:51.933]  The two scenarios are comparable in that they tried and tested method of navigating around the everyday security services, and more importantly, if the perpetrators get caught during the attack or after, with any incriminating evidence, they can just claim that they were just taking part in the exercise.
[01:54:52.813 --> 01:55:02.175]  Peter Power has since toned down his claims in further interviews, changing his story of the drill to make it seem less identical to the real attacks.
[01:55:02.890 --> 01:55:10.415]  He has also issued a statement via email in response to thousands of requests he is receiving demanding clarity on the issue.
[01:55:10.955 --> 01:55:16.478]  That re-emphasizes his backing away from his original precisely comment.
[01:55:18.539 --> 01:55:23.262]  It seems that Power may feel that he is in too deep and is backing away from the whole incident.
[01:55:23.482 --> 01:55:32.508]  This is because, due to the fact that Power himself and his company are not directly involved with the bombings, they have simply been used as a tool in a larger operation.
[01:55:33.863 --> 01:55:40.386]  Power has been hired by government before, and he has always used to release information after terrorist incidents in London.
[01:55:40.786 --> 01:55:52.070]  Two previous examples of this are on the March 2001 BBC television center bombing and the September 2000 rocket attack on the MI6 building.
[01:55:52.822 --> 01:55:59.428]  Was Power again used by the government as a conduit for information that would support their official version of events?
[01:56:00.089 --> 01:56:06.615]  Power's comments seem to suggest that the company was somehow involved in the response to the actual attacks.
[01:56:07.035 --> 01:56:14.262]  So if they were not working on behalf of London Underground or the government, then who were they allowed to be actively involved in multiple crime scenes?
[01:56:15.308 --> 01:56:33.814]  In short, our exercises, which involved just a few people and crisis managers, actually responded to a simulated series of activities involving on paper 1,000 staff, quickly became the real thing, and the players that morning responded very well indeed to the sudden reality of events.
[01:56:34.374 --> 01:56:37.555]  That's his quote in his little press release.
[01:56:38.467 --> 01:56:44.792]  Power has also spent time on the advisory board of the Canadian Centre for Emergency Preparedness.
[01:56:44.832 --> 01:56:52.659]  This is insignificant due to the fact that a key member of that board was Richard Shearer, Senior Vice President of Giuliani and Partners.
[01:56:53.179 --> 01:56:58.043]  Here they are listed together, and of course Giuliani was almost at the exact site of one of the bombings.
[01:56:59.415 --> 01:57:03.616]  Cher was intimately involved along with Giuliani in the crisis management on 9-11.
[01:57:03.796 --> 01:57:20.121]  Giuliani himself was in London on the 7th of July after traveling down from Yorkshire from a speaking engagement at a local government association conference in Hargate, where he received a standing ovation for praising Tony Blair and hyping the war on terror.
[01:57:20.141 --> 01:57:28.443]  And then it gets into the CIA connections and how the head of the London Underground works with Lord Giuliani.
[01:57:29.381 --> 01:57:32.502]  We'll be right back with the third hour.
[01:57:33.582 --> 01:57:37.183]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:37.423 --> 01:57:37.523]  Hello?
[01:57:37.543 --> 01:57:37.843]  Big Brother.
[01:57:37.883 --> 01:57:38.143]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.158 --> 01:57:53.300]  Welcome, my friends, already into hour number three.
[01:58:12.034 --> 01:58:16.518]  Just a plethora of important news and information coming up in this hour.
[01:58:16.598 --> 01:58:17.919]  And we have loaded phone lines.
[01:58:17.979 --> 01:58:19.981]  We'll be taking your phone calls.
[01:58:20.081 --> 01:58:23.704]  Jeff and Kevin and Tim and Robichu, Brian and many others.
[01:58:25.165 --> 01:58:30.189]  The websites are infowars.com and infowars.net.
[01:58:30.710 --> 01:58:32.171]  Updated daily for you.
[01:58:32.231 --> 01:58:33.772]  Many times, multiple times daily.
[01:58:35.634 --> 01:58:39.377]  Continuing with kind of this compilation article that Steve Watson wrote.
[01:58:40.771 --> 01:58:47.355]  Kind of bringing together some of the other articles he's written, some of the articles I've written, some of the articles Paul has written.
[01:58:49.477 --> 01:58:56.642]  Scheer was intimately involved, that's the head of the London Underground, with Giuliani in the crisis management on 9-11.
[01:58:56.942 --> 01:59:03.026]  Giuliani himself was in London on the 7th of July after traveling down from Yorkshire.
[01:59:04.150 --> 01:59:21.825]  Giuliani was also, coincidentally, only yards from Liverpool Street Station when the bombs went off, and later that day went on several TV networks saying that the crisis management teams, Peter Power's team, seemed like they were expecting the bombings to take place.
[01:59:23.166 --> 01:59:24.567]  We played that clip here, by the way.
[01:59:24.587 --> 01:59:30.632]  Giuliani has met several times with government and police officials in London since 9-11.
[01:59:33.041 --> 01:59:34.562]  CIA connections.
[01:59:35.183 --> 01:59:45.691]  The web of deceit extends further and the connections deeper when you take a look at the background of the Commissioner of Transport for London, Bob Kelly.
[01:59:48.513 --> 01:59:51.436]  Kelly also has connections with Giuliani.
[01:59:51.516 --> 01:59:52.997]  Just this whole crowd of people.
[01:59:53.539 --> 02:00:07.954]  During his time as president and CEO of the New York City Partnership, the city's leading business and civic organization, Kelly came into contact with Giuliani regularly and was even backed by Giuliani as a candidate for city school's chancellor.
[02:00:08.860 --> 02:00:09.601]  We're good to go.
[02:00:27.734 --> 02:00:39.161]  Kelly was also an advisory to the mayor's office on traffic management in New York, suggesting eliminating toll booths and just adding transponders on every car license plate.
[02:00:39.462 --> 02:00:49.248]  That way, motorists would automatically be charged every time they rode on a heavily traveled bridge or tunnel, or even a highway or major street during a time of peak usage.
[02:00:50.882 --> 02:00:58.664]  Early in his career, Kelly was tapped by the CIA when he became manager of intelligence operations and then executive assistant to the director.
[02:00:59.484 --> 02:01:05.265]  Kelly served under Richard Helms, who was also appointed CIA director after JFK was taken out.
[02:01:05.825 --> 02:01:13.907]  Helms was the only director to have been convicted of lying to Congress over the CIA undercover activities and served time in prison.
[02:01:14.477 --> 02:01:19.460]  He was heavily involved in the cover-up of MKUltra Project as his executive assistant.
[02:01:19.940 --> 02:01:22.321]  This means Kelly was also intimately involved.
[02:01:22.822 --> 02:01:26.884]  Kelly is also intimately a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:01:27.544 --> 02:01:37.450]  We should be asking ourselves, why is this CIA activist a high member of the establishment in charge of London's transportation network and the London Underground?
[02:01:38.110 --> 02:01:41.952]  Establishments have their mitts all over this latest stage atrocity.
[02:01:42.593 --> 02:01:43.253]  You can carry...
[02:01:45.288 --> 02:01:57.872]  Out the research and carry on probing deeper into the rabbit hole and you always come across the same elite figures and organizations hiding in every darkened nook and cranny.
[02:01:58.952 --> 02:02:06.435]  It's a certainty that as the weeks and months go by, more and more questions and connections will emerge.
[02:02:06.515 --> 02:02:07.195]  Stay tuned.
[02:02:07.992 --> 02:02:09.813]  But will people be paying attention?
[02:02:09.853 --> 02:02:11.294]  Will people be staying tuned?
[02:02:11.754 --> 02:02:14.075]  Or will they just kind of hear the TV on in the background?
[02:02:14.255 --> 02:02:17.157]  Oh, they got video of the bombers.
[02:02:17.237 --> 02:02:17.917]  They did it.
[02:02:17.977 --> 02:02:19.098]  Give up all your rights.
[02:02:21.039 --> 02:02:26.161]  We'll come back and get into some other really important news I haven't even gotten to yet or mentioned yet.
[02:02:26.181 --> 02:02:28.822]  And then we'll go to your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:28.843 --> 02:02:30.783]  It is Monday, the 18th day of July, 2005.
[02:02:38.303 --> 02:02:41.144]  We've got 55 minutes left before us, so stay with us.
[02:02:46.367 --> 02:02:49.228]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.488 --> 02:02:50.188]  Hello, my friends.
[02:02:50.268 --> 02:02:51.049]  Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.409 --> 02:02:56.111]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.411 --> 02:03:00.853]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:03:01.273 --> 02:03:05.415]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:05.655 --> 02:03:08.517]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.597 --> 02:03:13.259]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.480 --> 02:03:17.862]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight, piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.102 --> 02:03:25.306]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:25.586 --> 02:03:28.028]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:03:28.168 --> 02:03:29.909]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:03:45.453 --> 02:03:54.057]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:03:54.277 --> 02:04:05.563]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:04:05.763 --> 02:04:08.384]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:08.764 --> 02:04:15.212]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled, and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:04:15.372 --> 02:04:17.274]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:04:17.454 --> 02:04:23.481]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[02:04:23.741 --> 02:04:29.388]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[02:04:29.708 --> 02:04:33.629]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:04:34.390 --> 02:04:35.090]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:45.755 --> 02:04:48.118]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:04:48.358 --> 02:04:52.202]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[02:04:52.523 --> 02:04:53.343]  Read the labels.
[02:04:53.764 --> 02:04:57.908]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:04:58.129 --> 02:05:02.313]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:05:02.694 --> 02:05:07.559]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:05:07.939 --> 02:05:11.481]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:05:11.702 --> 02:05:17.045]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:05:17.325 --> 02:05:20.067]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.

[02:05:35.277 --> 02:05:35.657]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.329 --> 02:05:52.389]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.110 --> 02:05:54.210]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.870 --> 02:05:55.690]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.451 --> 02:05:57.971]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.011 --> 02:06:01.652]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.192 --> 02:06:06.313]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:09.114 --> 02:06:17.897]  Alright, I'm going to plunge into the news here for a few minutes, then we're going to go straight to your phone calls that are never boring, that are always interesting, and
[02:06:18.647 --> 02:06:30.317]  Really take us in directions that I would never go in, or would never think to go in, so I like that added randomness to it, that freedom of free speech.
[02:06:32.178 --> 02:06:36.062]  But this weekend, I really was just feeling humble.
[02:06:36.082 --> 02:06:47.431]  I mean, we all tend in life to be haughty and arrogant and aggressive, and there's something to be said for being aggressive, that way you don't get pushed around, but
[02:06:48.388 --> 02:06:52.630]  At the same time, I was just thinking about how transitory life is.
[02:06:53.791 --> 02:06:58.233]  The longer you live, the more people you're going to know who die.
[02:06:59.994 --> 02:07:13.021]  And a couple weeks ago, about a week and a half ago, I went to the memorial service of a family friend, another family friend.
[02:07:13.041 --> 02:07:17.684]  That's like four family friends that have died in the last eight, nine months.
[02:07:19.799 --> 02:07:28.543]  And here was this person who I knew in life, who was a great guy, a funny guy, a friendly person, a lot of hospitality.
[02:07:28.623 --> 02:07:30.704]  I'd stayed at his place many times.
[02:07:31.344 --> 02:07:33.425]  And here he was, dead.
[02:07:35.346 --> 02:07:35.707]  Dead.
[02:07:35.727 --> 02:07:40.109]  In front of me, the life had gone out of him.
[02:07:41.049 --> 02:07:47.132]  Life is so short and so precious and so majestic and so beautiful and so wonderful.
[02:07:48.766 --> 02:08:08.372]  And I just wanted to say that I'm thankful and that despite all the ugliness and despite all the bad things and the rotten things and the stinking things that are in the world, there is so much goodness.
[02:08:08.432 --> 02:08:09.752]  There is so much beauty.
[02:08:11.913 --> 02:08:13.553]  There is so much love.
[02:08:13.953 --> 02:08:15.794]  There is just such richness.
[02:08:18.210 --> 02:08:27.357]  And literally, I guess it's just part of growing up, but I remember five, ten years ago, if I was stuck in traffic, I would get really mad.
[02:08:29.658 --> 02:08:44.869]  And now, even if I'm late going somewhere, I don't get angry because I can look at birds, I can look at trees, I can look at the sky, I can look at a train rolling past, I can look over next to me and see a happy family.
[02:08:45.892 --> 02:08:50.314]  You know, in their car, and I can imagine what their daily lives are like.
[02:08:50.334 --> 02:08:53.635]  Or, let's be quite honest, I can look at a beautiful woman.
[02:08:53.655 --> 02:08:56.256]  Even though I'm married, I'm not perfect.
[02:08:56.717 --> 02:08:58.897]  I'm sure my wife looks at good-looking men.
[02:08:59.238 --> 02:09:02.399]  I can know why she's quite beautiful, though I try not to lust.
[02:09:03.579 --> 02:09:11.163]  You know, my point is that I just see thunderclouds and a sunset, and I just drink in the beauty.
[02:09:11.963 --> 02:09:13.964]  And I just commune with God.
[02:09:16.090 --> 02:09:18.091]  I just feel the life force.
[02:09:18.251 --> 02:09:19.631]  I don't know how to explain it.
[02:09:22.472 --> 02:09:24.912]  And frankly, that's what makes me get so angry.
[02:09:25.132 --> 02:09:27.573]  Because it is because I love life.
[02:09:29.453 --> 02:09:31.934]  It is because I love beauty.
[02:09:33.834 --> 02:09:44.837]  It is because I love decency and wholesomeness that I am so threatened and so angry at the New World Order.
[02:09:47.248 --> 02:10:02.037]  Because they are spoiled, inbred creatures who don't have a conscience, because if they did have a conscience, they couldn't do the things they do.
[02:10:02.557 --> 02:10:05.779]  In fact, it's not just that they're sociopathic, they're psychopathic.
[02:10:08.445 --> 02:10:13.568]  All the evidence shows they ritualistically do the same stuff over and over again.
[02:10:13.669 --> 02:10:17.711]  They revel in just wanton destruction.
[02:10:17.771 --> 02:10:20.813]  They revel in hurting innocents.
[02:10:20.913 --> 02:10:24.316]  Why do you think Satanists like to kill children?
[02:10:25.276 --> 02:10:26.497]  They hate the innocence.
[02:10:26.577 --> 02:10:27.998]  They hate the beauty.
[02:10:28.338 --> 02:10:29.439]  They hate the purity.
[02:10:29.479 --> 02:10:30.720]  They want to defile it.
[02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:35.203]  They think it gives them strength to do wicked things.
[02:10:36.491 --> 02:10:49.817]  They think that it makes them strong in the dark side, as the Emperor tells Anakin in Revenge of the Sith, you know, go to the temple, kill all the children, only then will you be strong enough in the dark side.
[02:10:50.077 --> 02:10:53.299]  You know, to use a popular culture analogy.
[02:10:57.837 --> 02:10:59.638]  And it just tears my heart out.
[02:10:59.718 --> 02:11:02.939]  I mean, I know what a threat the New World Order is.
[02:11:02.959 --> 02:11:12.441]  I mean, I've got articles here where, should there be health labels on all fast foods because of the sugar and fat to warn you that it's dangerous?
[02:11:13.482 --> 02:11:20.824]  Why we put labels on beer and tobacco, on alcohol and tobacco, why not?
[02:11:21.584 --> 02:11:25.125]  Now again, it sounds reasonable, but the next step is,
[02:11:26.187 --> 02:11:32.490]  Is going to be taxation and regulation of those items.
[02:11:33.170 --> 02:11:36.572]  You're going, Alex, what does that have to do with do as thou wilt?
[02:11:37.132 --> 02:11:46.236]  That is the whole of the law and the new world order only caring about itself and exercising raw power, just mercilessly killing innocents.
[02:11:48.092 --> 02:12:02.236]  Well, I was going to get into how the globalists openly know that sodium and other forms of fluoride are deadly poisonous, cause cancers, leukemia, bone cancer, retardation, just you name it.
[02:12:03.897 --> 02:12:09.599]  They know aspartame is an excitotoxin and brain damages and is highly addictive.
[02:12:10.919 --> 02:12:13.340]  That's why they put it in the drinks in 9,000 Foods.
[02:12:15.186 --> 02:12:23.473]  So, people are all aware of this, so they come out and say, no, we're not going to put it on the label warning you about aspartame or fluoride.
[02:12:26.055 --> 02:12:29.317]  No, we're not going to warn you about MSG, how deadly it is.
[02:12:30.438 --> 02:12:33.421]  We're not going to warn you, no, we're going to warn you about sugar.
[02:12:35.062 --> 02:12:35.302]  See?
[02:12:36.263 --> 02:12:41.467]  We're going to put a warning on saccharin, which isn't even bad for you.
[02:12:42.688 --> 02:12:44.910]  But we're not going to put a warning on aspartame.
[02:12:44.930 --> 02:12:48.773]  See, they're masters at giving you the false choice or diverting you.
[02:12:50.294 --> 02:12:53.958]  By the way, when did they put the labels on saccharin?
[02:12:55.319 --> 02:12:58.461]  In the early 1980s when they approved aspartame.
[02:12:58.822 --> 02:13:09.911]  They wanted to scare you away from saccharin, which does give rats cancer, but fatty, non-malignant cancer.
[02:13:11.050 --> 02:13:11.450]  Tumors.
[02:13:11.490 --> 02:13:14.252]  That is, non-cancerous fatty tumors.
[02:13:14.732 --> 02:13:28.580]  You know, if half the rat's diet, was the study, is saccharin, you know, over a year, which is basically the rat's life, it might get some tumors in its urinary tract.
[02:13:30.321 --> 02:13:36.905]  The studies show you have aspartame in rats, man, within weeks, these things are dead in the bottom of the cage.
[02:13:37.998 --> 02:13:38.818]  So what do they do?
[02:13:38.878 --> 02:13:41.800]  They come out and know all that about the aspartame.
[02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:51.584]  Don't put a label on it, but put a label on saccharin, which you could basically gobble by the bucket load, and this is not going to do anything to you.
[02:13:52.344 --> 02:13:53.845]  It's like eating dirt or something.
[02:13:53.905 --> 02:13:56.366]  It's just not... Oh, boy.
[02:13:58.507 --> 02:14:01.988]  And see, I've just spent three minutes on that, and I've literally... I'm not exaggerating.
[02:14:03.292 --> 02:14:15.038]  I've probably got a hundred articles here that I wanted to... I spent so many hours this weekend researching these, looking at them, and then I get on air and I'm just like, how do I even try to... You know what?
[02:14:15.058 --> 02:14:15.859]  I won't speed up.
[02:14:15.919 --> 02:14:16.719]  I won't get upset.
[02:14:16.779 --> 02:14:18.380]  I won't babble through it.
[02:14:18.440 --> 02:14:20.081]  I'll just cover what I can cover.
[02:14:21.622 --> 02:14:29.026]  On this day two years ago, missing Iraqi expert body found.
[02:14:30.046 --> 02:14:40.572]  A body believed to be that of government scientist Dr. David Kelly has been found in a wooded woodland area not far from Oxfordshire home.
[02:14:41.632 --> 02:14:51.558]  The discovery was made at 9.20 by a member of the police team called in to search for Dr. David Kelly after his family reported him missing last night.
[02:14:53.266 --> 02:15:02.433]  Dr. David Kelly had been at the center of an argument between the British government and the BBC about the use of intelligence reports in the run-up to the war against Iraq.
[02:15:04.134 --> 02:15:13.461]  He accused the government of inserting a claim into a dossier that Saddam Hussein was capable of developing weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes.
[02:15:16.003 --> 02:15:19.746]  And boy, the day he was found dead, they were saying it was a suicide.
[02:15:21.969 --> 02:15:35.754]  But of course, a couple weeks before, he told his American counterpart, who he'd been an inspector with in Iraq, and he told his British counterpart, if I don't keep my mouth shut, they're going to kill me and dump me in the woods.
[02:15:35.774 --> 02:15:42.396]  You know, that's like if I got up on air and said, I'm about to release news that they're probably going to kill me over it.
[02:15:43.016 --> 02:15:51.339]  And I even said, I've been told I'll be killed and it'll be a fake auto accident, and then tonight I die in a fake auto accident,
[02:15:52.102 --> 02:15:54.103]  And there's all this evidence of foul play.
[02:15:56.264 --> 02:15:59.506]  You know, let's say I get run over and then the person backs back over me.
[02:16:00.586 --> 02:16:02.267]  Like so many microbiologists.
[02:16:04.328 --> 02:16:07.190]  And, you know, would the police then investigate murder?
[02:16:08.530 --> 02:16:09.751]  It's like Princess Diana.
[02:16:09.791 --> 02:16:13.053]  She said, we now have the video which Scotland Yard grabbed.
[02:16:13.473 --> 02:16:14.954]  We have her own diary.
[02:16:14.994 --> 02:16:15.554]  We have that.
[02:16:16.238 --> 02:16:17.619]  And she told her bodyguards this.
[02:16:17.659 --> 02:16:19.060]  We have like five different sources.
[02:16:19.661 --> 02:16:28.487]  She said, Charles told me he's going to kill me, and it's going to look like an auto accident.
[02:16:28.587 --> 02:16:29.948]  Please save me.
[02:16:32.030 --> 02:16:33.671]  If he does kill me, he did it.
[02:16:35.032 --> 02:16:39.115]  And then she dies in that tunnel, and all the evidence shows they killed her.
[02:16:40.228 --> 02:16:42.090]  That takes an hour to go over that evidence.
[02:16:42.110 --> 02:16:46.193]  We have a whole archive on Infowars.com and Infowars.net.
[02:16:49.335 --> 02:16:53.899]  And, I mean, these people say they're going to kill me.
[02:16:53.919 --> 02:16:56.141]  You know, they come out and say, they're going to kill me.
[02:16:56.161 --> 02:16:56.861]  They're going to kill me.
[02:16:56.881 --> 02:16:58.042]  This is how they're going to kill me.
[02:16:58.943 --> 02:16:59.883]  And then they kill them.
[02:17:01.565 --> 02:17:05.668]  I mean, he had one undigested sleeping pill in his stomach.
[02:17:06.934 --> 02:17:11.057]  And they claimed that he really died of that because there wasn't enough blood at the scene from his wrist.
[02:17:11.097 --> 02:17:14.379]  A small puddle.
[02:17:14.419 --> 02:17:15.259]  They said about an inch.
[02:17:16.980 --> 02:17:17.801]  An inch around.
[02:17:18.441 --> 02:17:24.265]  Just a few driblets, you know, that had begun to sanguinate out onto the ground.
[02:17:26.306 --> 02:17:28.227]  That clearly hauled him out there, folks.
[02:17:29.968 --> 02:17:31.069]  Just like Vince Foster.
[02:17:33.791 --> 02:17:34.351]  Ron Brown.
[02:17:36.289 --> 02:17:40.613]  The army colonel that did the autopsy said Ron Brown had been shot in the head.
[02:17:41.154 --> 02:17:44.137]  But he was called the conspiracy theorist of the New York Times.
[02:17:45.798 --> 02:17:52.225]  To the farthest corners of the earth, explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[02:17:52.545 --> 02:17:54.867]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[02:17:55.107 --> 02:17:56.609]  Achieve financial independence.
[02:17:56.989 --> 02:17:57.790]  We're good to go.
[02:17:57.810 --> 02:17:58.230]  We're good to go.
[02:17:58.250 --> 02:17:58.811]  We're good to go.
[02:18:18.208 --> 02:18:18.889]  We're good to go.
[02:18:45.211 --> 02:18:45.972]  Terrorism.
[02:18:46.112 --> 02:18:46.872]  Terrorism.
[02:18:46.972 --> 02:18:47.813]  Chemical attacks.
[02:18:47.893 --> 02:18:48.554]  Dirty bombs.
[02:18:48.654 --> 02:18:49.054]  Fallout.
[02:18:49.134 --> 02:18:50.135]  Biological attack.
[02:18:50.315 --> 02:18:50.855]  And threats.
[02:18:50.935 --> 02:18:53.037]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[02:18:53.297 --> 02:18:54.879]  Alarming words for our time.
[02:18:55.139 --> 02:18:57.621]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:18:58.001 --> 02:19:12.572]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:19:12.612 --> 02:19:12.932]  government.
[02:19:13.113 --> 02:19:14.874]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:19:15.274 --> 02:19:21.179]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:19:21.339 --> 02:19:25.823]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[02:19:26.083 --> 02:19:32.809]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[02:19:44.714 --> 02:19:48.317]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[02:19:48.557 --> 02:19:49.418]  Look no further.
[02:19:49.718 --> 02:19:52.280]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.

[02:20:18.902 --> 02:20:19.322]  We're good to go.
[02:20:19.342 --> 02:20:19.823]  We're good to go.
[02:20:44.259 --> 02:20:47.641]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[02:20:47.881 --> 02:20:48.201]  Why?
[02:20:48.221 --> 02:20:51.183]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[02:20:51.263 --> 02:20:56.206]  Cardivite drops in capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.
[02:20:56.326 --> 02:21:06.051]  The all-natural ingredients in cardivite begin immediately working to increase metabolism in your heart muscle tissue, mitigating heart rhythm abnormalities, and improving oxygen and blood flow in the heart.

[02:21:50.004 --> 02:21:52.426]  Oh, man, there is a mass of news here.
[02:21:53.127 --> 02:21:56.350]  FBI monitored websites for 2004 protests.
[02:21:56.750 --> 02:21:59.993]  Groups criticize agency surveillance for terror unit.
[02:22:01.474 --> 02:22:03.776]  Also using the terror attacks in London.
[02:22:04.377 --> 02:22:08.741]  Terror laws face easy ride in climate of cooperation.
[02:22:08.841 --> 02:22:09.862]  Thanks, Al-Qaeda.
[02:22:10.562 --> 02:22:11.523]  Al-Ci-Aida.
[02:22:12.104 --> 02:22:15.827]  It's full steam ahead for the EU Constitution, even after no votes.
[02:22:16.977 --> 02:22:25.863]  So, we're winning the battle of the hearts and minds, but we're now learning that we're in a dictatorship, because whether it's NAFTA, GATT, any of this, they don't do what the people want.
[02:22:25.924 --> 02:22:27.084]  They just do whatever they want.
[02:22:28.946 --> 02:22:31.508]  But let's go to calls, because the people have been holding patiently.
[02:22:31.888 --> 02:22:35.050]  Jeff in Ohio, then Kevin, Tim, Rabishu, Brian, and others.
[02:22:35.310 --> 02:22:35.951]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[02:22:37.392 --> 02:22:38.152]  God bless, Alex.
[02:22:38.493 --> 02:22:42.435]  I just had a few points I wanted to make real quick, and then let you comment on them.
[02:22:42.636 --> 02:22:45.538]  I found out recently...
[02:22:46.496 --> 02:23:02.109]  Through a very close person to me, that Pacific Northwest Laboratories up in Washington State is actually proselytizing people to create false Al Qaeda websites through Homeland Security.
[02:23:02.770 --> 02:23:11.997]  So now they're not even using their corporations to put these up, but they're hiring people outside of the company to build these false websites.
[02:23:12.077 --> 02:23:13.839]  And the cover story is that they need
[02:23:14.321 --> 02:23:24.747]  To build false websites so that they can train their agents not to cruise around on Arab websites and damage their security clearances.
[02:23:24.847 --> 02:23:27.909]  Second point... Well, let me stop you right there for those that don't know.
[02:23:27.929 --> 02:23:36.114]  In every case with the chopping the heads off or the torture or Al-Qaeda taking credit, it always leads back to Langley...
[02:23:37.822 --> 02:23:44.766]  Virginia, or it leads back to Maryland, or it leads back to Houston, or it leads back to other neocon computers.
[02:23:44.846 --> 02:23:53.310]  I mean, as the direct sites loading this stuff up, and you're saying that, I mean, do you have an article on this, or does this come from your friends?
[02:23:53.470 --> 02:23:55.771]  No, this is personal knowledge.
[02:23:56.351 --> 02:23:57.612]  I know the person.
[02:23:57.672 --> 02:23:59.233]  And, of course, that's the cover story.
[02:23:59.273 --> 02:24:00.093]  I mean, that's classic.
[02:24:00.553 --> 02:24:01.974]  This is just for drills.
[02:24:02.034 --> 02:24:04.996]  This is just so we can train our employees what to not cert.
[02:24:05.096 --> 02:24:05.776]  You know, I understand.
[02:24:05.936 --> 02:24:06.576]  Yeah.
[02:24:07.257 --> 02:24:15.741]  Second point, quickly, I also checked up on the national ID slot in the ATS computers.
[02:24:15.801 --> 02:24:19.484]  I have somebody who's on the inside there, and they said that that was in way before 9-11.
[02:24:20.876 --> 02:24:28.722]  Have you seen the video we put on the website we have from the Texas Department of Transportation with the national ID card code number already in the computers?
[02:24:29.082 --> 02:24:31.264]  Long before they passed it.
[02:24:31.684 --> 02:24:32.865]  Yeah, it's insane.
[02:24:33.305 --> 02:24:48.336]  And the big one I wanted to release to you, I don't know if you're aware of it or not, but I actually heard Sean Hannity on his radio show right before they went to a break so that he could release the information and then not discuss it, admit, admit,
[02:24:48.857 --> 02:25:04.727]  That the four bombers came from a government-funded front group in London, and the government had paid and funded the Al-Qaeda front group that they were brought into Al-Qaeda through in London.
[02:25:05.027 --> 02:25:06.808]  And I wanted to hear your comment on that.
[02:25:07.148 --> 02:25:11.771]  Well, that's the truth, but am I in a time warp or something?
[02:25:12.955 --> 02:25:14.476]  When did you hear Hannity say that?
[02:25:15.117 --> 02:25:21.301]  That was actually Friday on his show, about mid-broadcast.
[02:25:21.361 --> 02:25:24.282]  And one article, I mean, did he say what publication?
[02:25:24.443 --> 02:25:30.847]  No, he just spit it out on the air right before they went to a break, and then that was all he said about it.
[02:25:30.867 --> 02:25:40.793]  But he said, you know, oh yeah, he said, you know, the four bombers were, you know, brought into Al-Qaeda through a government-funded Al-Qaeda front group.
[02:25:41.249 --> 02:25:44.150]  And then he never made any comment about it after that.
[02:25:44.490 --> 02:25:47.510]  It's like, how could... Well, for those who don't know, this is how it works.
[02:25:47.590 --> 02:25:49.671]  The top Al-Qaeda are CIA.
[02:25:50.271 --> 02:25:54.432]  And then they go around finding useful idiot Muslims to carry out real attacks.
[02:25:54.852 --> 02:25:56.352]  But those are mainly in the Middle East.
[02:25:56.972 --> 02:26:02.113]  And then over here in the West, they will just have other agents who think they're part of drills on 9-11.
[02:26:02.493 --> 02:26:04.154]  That's covered in my film, Martial Law.
[02:26:04.174 --> 02:26:06.174]  And that's clearly what happened here.
[02:26:06.574 --> 02:26:07.894]  So it's the same M.O.
[02:26:08.074 --> 02:26:08.955]  over and over again.
[02:26:08.995 --> 02:26:10.955]  I wish somebody could find that clip and send it to me.
[02:26:11.770 --> 02:26:14.492]  If I get a chance to grab that, I definitely will.
[02:26:14.792 --> 02:26:24.280]  I will say one thing that you've taught us, that whatever the globalists say that Al-Qaeda is doing is what they're doing, and they always talk about chatter.
[02:26:24.947 --> 02:26:26.668]  And I am just terrified right now.
[02:26:26.728 --> 02:26:37.754]  The chatter on television, and I watch a lot of television, the chatter on television right now is unbelievable as to people claiming nuclear attack on the United States.
[02:26:38.094 --> 02:26:38.915]  I know.
[02:26:39.015 --> 02:26:40.696]  That's all everybody is saying.
[02:26:40.796 --> 02:26:42.837]  It's just wall to wall.
[02:26:42.897 --> 02:26:44.738]  They snuck them across the southern border.
[02:26:45.138 --> 02:26:46.499]  They're going to nuke us any minute.
[02:26:46.519 --> 02:26:47.820]  We better give up all our freedoms.
[02:26:48.400 --> 02:26:58.146]  And whether it's going to happen six months from now or ten years from now, the globalists are planning some type of event to radically re-engineer the society.
[02:26:58.967 --> 02:27:02.128]  If there's a nuclear attack, giving our rights up doesn't keep us safe.
[02:27:02.469 --> 02:27:08.913]  Controlling the border, deporting the illegal aliens, that keeps us safe, but that's never going to happen.
[02:27:09.213 --> 02:27:10.113]  You watch, my friend.
[02:27:10.273 --> 02:27:17.758]  After the nuclear attack, we're going to have an even wider open border with a UN security perimeter around North America itself.
[02:27:19.159 --> 02:27:22.983]  And you'll be an evil liberal if you criticize the government's open border policies.
[02:27:23.844 --> 02:27:28.188]  But whether they're going to carry out an attack or not, this is terrorism.
[02:27:28.528 --> 02:27:30.951]  They're terrorizing us going, you're going to get it.
[02:27:31.211 --> 02:27:32.072]  You're going to get this.
[02:27:32.412 --> 02:27:33.193]  You're going to get it.
[02:27:33.553 --> 02:27:34.534]  You're going to get it.
[02:27:35.735 --> 02:27:36.696]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.137 --> 02:27:38.738]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.758 --> 02:27:42.342]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.576 --> 02:27:50.318]  For a while now, you've been hearing about energized water and what it can do for your health.
[02:27:50.578 --> 02:27:54.041]  But have you taken the next step and actually experienced energized water?
[02:27:54.321 --> 02:27:59.144]  It's absolutely incredible what you'll experience while using the energized products from Aqua Northwest.
[02:27:59.444 --> 02:28:03.726]  You've seen the banner on GCNlive.com, but have you experienced the power of the pyramid?
[02:28:03.927 --> 02:28:07.088]  We all know that negative energy can make you sick at home or in the office.
[02:28:07.249 --> 02:28:11.471]  But the energy pyramid from Aqua Northwest wipes out that negative energy within a 125-foot diameter.
[02:28:13.032 --> 02:28:21.375]  After one hour, negative energy fields should be raised to a positive level, resulting in you and others in the area to feel wonderfully energized, among other possible health benefits.

[02:28:45.956 --> 02:28:52.861]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[02:28:53.381 --> 02:28:58.805]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Nonex Nail Gel.
[02:28:59.205 --> 02:29:09.232]  All-natural Nonex is a topical, ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[02:29:09.372 --> 02:29:11.754]  Nonex Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[02:29:12.094 --> 02:29:15.096]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost purple.
[02:29:15.596 --> 02:29:16.776]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[02:29:16.896 --> 02:29:24.379]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[02:29:24.639 --> 02:29:26.359]  It's also money-back guarantee.
[02:29:26.719 --> 02:29:38.483]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, and independent pharmacies nationwide, or online at drugstore.com.
[02:29:38.983 --> 02:29:43.324]  Non-X Nail Gel, for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[02:29:44.907 --> 02:29:51.154]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:29:51.294 --> 02:29:57.461]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:29:57.741 --> 02:30:06.131]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:30:06.411 --> 02:30:13.453]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:30:13.733 --> 02:30:18.554]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:30:18.775 --> 02:30:24.176]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:30:24.516 --> 02:30:27.557]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:30:27.937 --> 02:30:38.101]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69, or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:30:38.281 --> 02:30:42.343]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:30:42.503 --> 02:30:52.267]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:52.307 --> 02:30:54.548]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:30:57.324 --> 02:31:10.667]  All right, we're going to go back to your calls here in a moment, but I need to get into this article.
[02:31:11.307 --> 02:31:13.108]  This is on the London Telegraph today.
[02:31:13.788 --> 02:31:18.469]  It's full steam ahead for EU constitution, even after no votes.
[02:31:19.358 --> 02:31:27.607]  You may have got the impression that the European Constitution was dead, that the French had failed it, that the Dutch had pounded a stake through its heart.
[02:31:28.208 --> 02:31:29.430]  If so, think again.
[02:31:29.450 --> 02:31:36.297]  The Constitution is being implemented, clause by clause, as if the no votes had not happened.
[02:31:37.399 --> 02:31:38.440]  While British ministers...
[02:31:40.339 --> 02:31:44.420]  Shudder on about the document being in deep freeze.
[02:31:44.961 --> 02:31:47.821]  Other countries are plunging ahead with ratification.
[02:31:48.422 --> 02:31:55.544]  Since the no votes, three nations, Cyprus, Malta, and Luxembourg, have gone on to approve the text.
[02:31:57.144 --> 02:32:05.927]  All right, these may not be the three mightiest powers in Europe, but the endorsement means that 13 of the 25 members have now said yes.
[02:32:07.569 --> 02:32:11.672]  The Eurocrats see this number as enormously significant.
[02:32:12.713 --> 02:32:36.350]  It is a strong signal that a majority of the member states think that the Constitution correlates to their expectations, said the Commission President, Jose Manuel Barroso, on hearing that Luxembourg had ratified, quote, the Constitution is not dead, added the Grand Duchess Prime Minister, Jean-Claude Juncker.
[02:32:37.347 --> 02:32:45.535]  The European Parliament has duly set up a committee to look at how to proceed with implementation.
[02:32:46.656 --> 02:32:53.722]  Formal ratification by all 25 states is regarded in Brussels as a technicality.
[02:32:54.623 --> 02:33:01.950]  To all intents and purposes, the EU is carrying on as though the Constitution was already in force.
[02:33:02.705 --> 02:33:10.869]  Most of the institutions that would be authorized are either up and running already or in the process of being established.
[02:33:11.509 --> 02:33:16.692]  My research has produced the following non-exhaustive list.
[02:33:18.300 --> 02:33:40.036]  The European Space Command, the EU Criminal Code, the European Defense Agency, the Common Asylum Policy, the Mutual Defense Clause, which replicates NATO's Article 5, the External Border Agency, again, Continental Security Force, the Fundamental Rights Agency,
[02:33:40.805 --> 02:33:43.906]  The Knee Monitoring Center for Racism and Xenophobia.
[02:33:44.246 --> 02:33:45.486]  That's the Thought Crime Group.
[02:33:46.087 --> 02:33:50.668]  Anonymous Autonomous Politico-Military Command Structures.
[02:33:51.388 --> 02:33:53.769]  The European External Action Service.
[02:33:54.469 --> 02:33:55.609]  The EU Diplomatic Corps.
[02:33:56.089 --> 02:34:01.691]  The EU Prosecuting Magistrate and Magistracy.
[02:34:02.171 --> 02:34:04.672]  The Union Foreign Minister.
[02:34:05.632 --> 02:34:08.293]  That sickly socialist Javier Solano.
[02:34:09.818 --> 02:34:14.560]  The Charter of Fundamental Rights, which then again says you have no rights under its charter.
[02:34:15.820 --> 02:34:24.523]  And it goes, whenever a chunk of the Constitution comes before my committee in the European Parliament for approval, I ask, where is the existing treaty?
[02:34:25.003 --> 02:34:27.564]  Does it say that we have to do this?
[02:34:30.125 --> 02:34:31.866]  Where does it say we can't?
[02:34:32.506 --> 02:34:38.748]  replies my Federalist colleagues, giggling at their own cleverness, like Mr. Toad and the women of the Willows.
[02:34:39.525 --> 02:34:40.765]  Press for proper answer.
[02:34:40.825 --> 02:34:49.849]  They point to flimsy cat's cradle of some communiques, council resolutions, and commission press releases.
[02:34:50.409 --> 02:34:55.071]  The more honest of them go on to explain that this is how the EU has always been operated.
[02:34:55.511 --> 02:35:04.814]  First, it extends its justification into a new area, and then, often years later, it authorizes its power grab in a retrospective treaty.
[02:35:05.803 --> 02:35:11.347]  The 25 member governments, they argue, have endorsed the Constitution so far.
[02:35:12.748 --> 02:35:16.930]  This is written by a member of the European Parliament who's British.
[02:35:19.252 --> 02:35:24.155]  I really don't know how to belabor the point properly.
[02:35:24.215 --> 02:35:26.057]  I mean, I could talk for hours about this.
[02:35:27.678 --> 02:35:32.701]  We have an unelected private state board that has unelected people on it.
[02:35:33.493 --> 02:35:33.914]  I don't think so.
[02:35:49.369 --> 02:35:58.957]  And they just say we're putting transponders in all the IDs and all of the inspection stickers and all the major roads are going to be toll roads.
[02:35:58.997 --> 02:35:59.917]  Ha ha ha ha!
[02:36:00.498 --> 02:36:04.141]  And if you don't like it, you can just go straight to Hades.
[02:36:06.502 --> 02:36:18.572]  And then luckily we did shoot it down at the state level when they tried to get the law passed for the transponder, but still the cities are moving ahead to put the transponder readers in and
[02:36:19.355 --> 02:36:23.017]  And they just laugh at us and say, you can't unelect us.
[02:36:25.059 --> 02:36:33.164]  Again, when you hear about regionalization and, oh, we're working with other counties around us to cut back on the cost.
[02:36:33.224 --> 02:36:42.230]  Why, if five counties or ten counties pool their cost, why, then your taxes will go down.
[02:36:44.171 --> 02:36:46.692]  Okay, that regionalization started 25 years ago.
[02:36:46.712 --> 02:36:47.613]  Have your taxes gone down?
[02:36:49.298 --> 02:36:52.299]  About, what, 20% of the country's gotten rid of its sheriffs.
[02:36:53.199 --> 02:37:03.761]  The local chartered city, which literally, folks, you can go out to the middle of nowhere, get people to move there, a few hundred, and start your own city.
[02:37:04.261 --> 02:37:11.262]  You can appoint yourself mayor, appoint a police chief, and your police chief can go out and start writing tickets.
[02:37:12.663 --> 02:37:13.763]  You can have one cop.
[02:37:15.001 --> 02:37:29.824]  And he can sit there, and if he finds a marijuana cigarette, he can take that Cadillac, and you can drive it around as the mayor, and you can turn yourself into a petty viceroy, even have yourself a pink throne if you want to sit on it, and make people feed you bonbons.
[02:37:31.644 --> 02:37:33.304]  That's what Sheriff Arpaio's done.
[02:37:33.784 --> 02:37:35.465]  By the way, he got caught three weeks ago.
[02:37:36.045 --> 02:37:38.265]  This is the Arizona Republic.
[02:37:39.765 --> 02:37:42.066]  We've created a Watch Arpaio section.
[02:37:42.126 --> 02:37:43.486]  I noticed it hadn't been updated with this.
[02:37:44.241 --> 02:37:55.691]  Not only is he out running his car through businesses, he's so hopped up on whatever power or whatever he's on, now he wanted to act like he was under terror attack.
[02:37:57.453 --> 02:38:01.857]  So he can have checkpoints on all the major roads and surveil, and openly he wants to search everyone.
[02:38:02.577 --> 02:38:04.859]  And he's like a god or something, and he was caught.
[02:38:05.760 --> 02:38:06.681]  They found a 19-year-old kid...
[02:38:08.644 --> 02:38:15.669]  And they admittedly went and set him up, and the sheriff's deputies posed, and they said, let's build a bomb and bomb Arpaio.
[02:38:16.770 --> 02:38:26.836]  And the kid wouldn't do it, but they still got him talking about it, and so they busted the kid and railroaded him, and then Arpaio got to talk about how they were trying to pipe bomb him and how he's under Al-Qaeda attack.
[02:38:28.277 --> 02:38:32.280]  The guy drives around with a driver and a giant armored limousine,
[02:38:33.681 --> 02:38:38.663]  And one of my friends, Kevin Booth, went in there making a documentary, and Arpaio let him in his prison for like a whole day.
[02:38:39.023 --> 02:38:44.806]  And Arpaio literally is stumbling around going, You know how powerful I am?
[02:38:45.146 --> 02:38:46.386]  But we've had him on here before.
[02:38:47.307 --> 02:38:49.848]  The guy's just totally nuts.
[02:38:51.028 --> 02:38:52.009]  And he'll fall.
[02:38:52.089 --> 02:38:52.789]  He'll always fall.
[02:38:52.829 --> 02:38:56.671]  He'll get so crazy, he'll start walking around naked in his front yard or something.
[02:38:58.209 --> 02:38:59.710]  This is how power works, folks.
[02:38:59.750 --> 02:39:02.111]  He'll finally go... You know what?
[02:39:02.171 --> 02:39:12.016]  As an example of this, I ought to move to some little town that's not incorporated, that's got like 100 residents, convince them all of how great I am.
[02:39:12.516 --> 02:39:13.096]  I could do this.
[02:39:14.037 --> 02:39:16.578]  And maybe even admit to them it's going to be a test.
[02:39:17.799 --> 02:39:21.201]  And then get our own cop and just literally have like a slave pen.
[02:39:21.241 --> 02:39:24.162]  We put people in who get pulled over for speeding.
[02:39:24.742 --> 02:39:25.783]  And we could have them all...
[02:39:27.310 --> 02:39:27.951]  We're good to go.
[02:39:52.714 --> 02:39:53.874]  You know, that's all government is.
[02:39:54.095 --> 02:39:58.876]  They wear fancy uniforms and fancy hats and lots of medallions and symbols.
[02:39:59.236 --> 02:40:00.057]  You know why they did that?
[02:40:00.077 --> 02:40:03.238]  Because they found 3,000 years ago, people wouldn't listen to you.
[02:40:04.699 --> 02:40:06.199]  You come along and say, I'm your ruler.
[02:40:07.280 --> 02:40:09.420]  People wouldn't do that if you were just dressed normally.
[02:40:09.480 --> 02:40:19.044]  But if they found that you wore a big magic hat and had people tooting horns whenever you arrived, ooh, let me grovel before you.
[02:40:21.258 --> 02:40:23.478]  You see, I'm ranting.
[02:40:24.819 --> 02:40:30.720]  The point here is that the EU, there is no law.
[02:40:30.780 --> 02:40:32.620]  They do what they want, when they want.
[02:40:33.260 --> 02:40:35.841]  They're arresting people who criticize French produce.
[02:40:35.861 --> 02:40:38.561]  They're arresting farmers who won't take GM foods.
[02:40:38.601 --> 02:40:41.402]  They're arresting people who criticize the government.
[02:40:41.742 --> 02:40:43.182]  They're taking private property.
[02:40:43.222 --> 02:40:44.463]  They're forcibly drugging.
[02:40:44.483 --> 02:40:45.403]  It's hellish.
[02:40:48.203 --> 02:40:50.144]  And they don't even have these authorities.
[02:40:50.164 --> 02:40:51.184]  They just claim these.
[02:40:51.344 --> 02:40:53.045]  See, that's what tyranny is.
[02:40:53.165 --> 02:41:11.953]  It's some group of people that have a group of hired thugs who say they're the government and strut around with machine guns, and they know that you're waking up to them, so they carry out a few terror attacks, blame some patsies who all conveniently die, and then you'll give over your freedom to them because they're going to take good care of you.
[02:41:14.742 --> 02:41:16.062]  Oh, you don't want to be in Iraq?
[02:41:16.102 --> 02:41:18.183]  Well, we better fight them over there instead of over here.
[02:41:18.203 --> 02:41:20.904]  All right, I'm going quickly.
[02:41:20.924 --> 02:41:23.885]  Each caller gets just about a minute or so because people have been holding too long.
[02:41:25.425 --> 02:41:26.705]  Kevin in Tennessee, go ahead.
[02:41:26.725 --> 02:41:27.806]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:41:27.886 --> 02:41:29.566]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[02:41:30.006 --> 02:41:42.690]  Last night on our local Fox affiliate, they ran a real brief three-minute piece on a ban, 16 illegal immigrants, no documentation whatsoever from Mexico and Brazil, who were detained for maybe an hour and a half
[02:41:43.149 --> 02:41:44.569]  And then released completely.
[02:41:45.310 --> 02:41:46.150]  Nothing done whatsoever.
[02:41:47.130 --> 02:41:47.670]  Could not believe.
[02:41:49.131 --> 02:41:52.632]  Well, sir, it's like a cruise ship of old.
[02:41:52.692 --> 02:41:54.112]  There's three different classes.
[02:41:54.652 --> 02:41:56.553]  First class, second class, and steerage.
[02:41:58.053 --> 02:42:00.013]  And citizens are in steerage.
[02:42:00.053 --> 02:42:05.755]  We're down in the bottom, sleeping on mats on top of crates of goods.
[02:42:06.633 --> 02:42:11.055]  And then second class, and I'm serious when I say this, is illegal aliens.
[02:42:11.155 --> 02:42:12.475]  It's part of the open border system.
[02:42:12.495 --> 02:42:18.317]  They give them all this free welfare and housing loans as an incentive to get them here.
[02:42:18.757 --> 02:42:25.260]  And then first class is police, government officials, authorities.
[02:42:25.280 --> 02:42:27.120]  You know, we're just the servants.
[02:42:27.540 --> 02:42:32.062]  And then there's a super class above first class, royalty or sovereigns.
[02:42:32.822 --> 02:42:34.803]  And that's the government gods.
[02:42:35.660 --> 02:42:54.069]  Well, listen, the feds are telling that police chief up in Maine, there's another one in Connecticut, their towns are being taken over by illegal aliens, and so they started arresting them, and the feds won't come get them, even when they're felons, so the police chief is charging them with trespassing.
[02:42:54.773 --> 02:43:02.256]  And now the ACLU, and Mecha, and La Raza, and La Rica, and Kistis, and Alberto Gonzalez, they're all real upset right now.
[02:43:02.736 --> 02:43:20.142]  But all that aside, folks, how is there a war on terror, and you've got a thumb scan at the Disney World, and you've got to have cameras on your street corner, and you've got to have this database watching you, and we've got to have the FBI spying on all the mainstream political parties, but the border's wide open, huh?
[02:43:21.863 --> 02:43:23.063]  Sorry, go ahead, I'll shut up.
[02:43:23.427 --> 02:43:24.327]  No, you're fine.
[02:43:24.667 --> 02:43:31.810]  At the end of that little news bite there, they gave a note that, why weren't they detained or deported or anything?
[02:43:31.850 --> 02:43:32.450]  We'll have news at 11.
[02:43:33.310 --> 02:43:36.792]  No news ran at 11, and no other affiliate even touched the story.
[02:43:37.472 --> 02:43:38.412]  Complete blackout on it.
[02:43:38.632 --> 02:43:45.875]  Sir, the Houston Chronicle last year headline, 400,000 felons released, and then later admitted, oh, they're illegal aliens.
[02:43:47.153 --> 02:43:52.255]  400,000 in Texas, and the state just, look, sir, they are actually gods.
[02:43:52.275 --> 02:43:53.056]  Do you understand that?
[02:43:53.516 --> 02:43:55.517]  They actually do whatever they want.
[02:43:56.117 --> 02:43:57.798]  They're allowed to have 10 to an apartment.
[02:43:57.858 --> 02:43:59.739]  If you do, you're kicked out right next door to them.
[02:44:00.019 --> 02:44:02.340]  They're given all these free city housing loans.
[02:44:02.600 --> 02:44:05.381]  They get, in most states, double tuition that citizens get.
[02:44:05.401 --> 02:44:10.923]  Do you understand, sir, they get no taxes for 10 years.
[02:44:10.943 --> 02:44:11.463]  Did you know that?
[02:44:12.164 --> 02:44:12.884]  I did not know that.
[02:44:12.964 --> 02:44:13.904]  They get everything.
[02:44:16.361 --> 02:44:22.203]  Well, if you don't have a social or whatever is required to get a job, how would you pay the taxes in the first place if you're illegal?
[02:44:22.303 --> 02:44:24.404]  It's all selectively enforced, though.
[02:44:24.864 --> 02:44:26.905]  You can't get that job, though.
[02:44:28.205 --> 02:44:36.108]  I mean, folks, now as a citizen, to get on a plane or to get in many cases when they spot three, four forms of identification?
[02:44:36.128 --> 02:44:40.129]  Oh, you've got to go back and do something?
[02:44:41.309 --> 02:44:42.270]  You still there, Kevin?
[02:44:42.330 --> 02:44:42.550]  I'm here.
[02:44:42.570 --> 02:44:44.331]  Go ahead and finish up your points.
[02:44:44.811 --> 02:44:45.691]  Oh, that is actually it.
[02:44:46.667 --> 02:44:48.929]  That's all I had, and I thank you for letting me get in there.
[02:44:49.190 --> 02:44:50.211]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:44:50.251 --> 02:44:51.112]  Thanks for holding.
[02:44:51.612 --> 02:44:52.413]  Jim in Ohio.
[02:44:52.433 --> 02:44:53.174]  Go ahead, Jim.
[02:44:53.814 --> 02:44:54.375]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:44:55.035 --> 02:44:55.356]  Welcome.
[02:44:55.916 --> 02:45:03.324]  I just wanted to read something by everyone here, and maybe it will help them as they try to get other people to wake up.
[02:45:03.384 --> 02:45:08.649]  There's a really serious psychological phenomenon, I think I've talked to you about it before, called cognitive dissonance.
[02:45:09.508 --> 02:45:19.110]  Well, yeah, it's where you have your view, you're invested in this political view, this societal view, and you're going to defend it no matter what.
[02:45:19.390 --> 02:45:20.090]  Exactly, yeah.
[02:45:20.110 --> 02:45:26.391]  I think that's the biggest hurdle that all of us that are out there in the field trying to wake people up come across.
[02:45:27.331 --> 02:45:31.652]  I might be wrong, but I come to people and they go, oh, no, that would never happen here.
[02:45:31.672 --> 02:45:38.353]  You hear the same old things over and over and over when you're putting piles and piles and piles of evidence directly in front of their faces.
[02:45:39.764 --> 02:45:41.545]  And that's a theory of cognitive dissonance.
[02:45:41.585 --> 02:45:43.827]  Isn't that right out of Tavistock Institute?
[02:45:45.328 --> 02:45:45.848]  It is.
[02:45:46.689 --> 02:45:52.293]  I noticed, too, that one of the bombings they described as near Tavistock Square in London.
[02:45:52.713 --> 02:45:53.053]  Yes.
[02:45:53.534 --> 02:45:54.094]  Very interesting.
[02:45:54.154 --> 02:45:56.376]  And two other things real quick.
[02:45:56.396 --> 02:46:09.265]  I noticed in Dealey Plaza where President Lincoln, I'm sorry, President Kennedy was assassinated, and I noticed in your Martial Law 9-11 movie that they showed the aerial and both overlooking...
[02:46:09.898 --> 02:46:16.105]  The area of Ground Zero and the area of De La Plaza, they have that one building that has the silver pyramid with the black capstone on it.
[02:46:16.886 --> 02:46:17.827]  Well, that's their symbol.
[02:46:17.867 --> 02:46:18.588]  Thanks for the call.
[02:46:18.628 --> 02:46:19.509]  They always put that.
[02:46:20.390 --> 02:46:21.871]  Oh, that's with Diana.
[02:46:21.911 --> 02:46:24.875]  With every other killing they commit, they put a black obelisk there.
[02:46:25.836 --> 02:46:28.238]  Let's go to Rambiki, I believe, in Texas.
[02:46:29.870 --> 02:46:30.550]  Robishu?
[02:46:30.971 --> 02:46:32.091]  Am I pronouncing that right?
[02:46:32.611 --> 02:46:34.893]  It's just a fake name I use online, but yeah.
[02:46:34.913 --> 02:46:36.853]  Well, let's just call you Possum Belly then.
[02:46:37.254 --> 02:46:38.794]  Call in and give us an easy name, brother.
[02:46:39.055 --> 02:46:39.755]  My name is Bogus.
[02:46:39.795 --> 02:46:40.315]  That's my name.
[02:46:40.515 --> 02:46:41.596]  Okay, Bogus Possum.
[02:46:41.616 --> 02:46:42.016]  Go ahead.
[02:46:43.237 --> 02:46:49.340]  I first off wanted to apologize for overreacting in reference to your comments about my friend Don Bagdaro back in December.
[02:46:49.360 --> 02:46:52.961]  Second off, I just wanted to say I just seen your film Martial Law Saturday.
[02:46:53.021 --> 02:46:54.342]  I showed it to a whole bunch of my friends.
[02:46:54.662 --> 02:46:56.163]  I want to thank you for the wake-up call.
[02:46:57.310 --> 02:47:04.692]  And third off, I want to use some clips from some of your films in my band's music as, you know, we call it info metal.
[02:47:05.873 --> 02:47:06.633]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:47:06.653 --> 02:47:07.273]  Thanks.
[02:47:08.754 --> 02:47:09.254]  That's it, huh?
[02:47:09.314 --> 02:47:10.414]  I'm just calling in for that.
[02:47:11.955 --> 02:47:13.155]  Brian in Florida.
[02:47:13.195 --> 02:47:13.975]  Go ahead, Brian.
[02:47:13.995 --> 02:47:16.636]  Hey, Alex.
[02:47:17.156 --> 02:47:17.537]  Hello.
[02:47:17.797 --> 02:47:18.497]  Hey, how's it going?
[02:47:18.797 --> 02:47:19.077]  Good.
[02:47:20.417 --> 02:47:20.698]  U.S.
[02:47:20.838 --> 02:47:22.798]  plans nuclear attack on Iran.
[02:47:22.818 --> 02:47:25.139]  Comments on that?
[02:47:26.471 --> 02:47:33.155]  Well, our government has been planning for a nuclear attack on Iran, and that's why they're hyping the nuclear threat to us.
[02:47:33.296 --> 02:47:35.597]  Well, we're under threat, so we better nuke them.
[02:47:35.657 --> 02:47:36.918]  Well, we were under threat.
[02:47:37.779 --> 02:47:41.861]  Kissinger, don't exclude military action against Iran if negotiations fail.
[02:47:42.622 --> 02:47:53.969]  Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, in a wide-ranging discussion of foreign policy issues, says he is disturbed at the possibility that Iran will develop nuclear weapons.
[02:47:54.429 --> 02:47:54.970]  Know how...
[02:47:55.951 --> 02:48:10.845]  And Cookie Monster went on to say, if current negotiations to stem Tehran's nuclear program fail, in fact, he says, Iran's program is more worrisome than the crisis of North Korea's nuclear weapons, and that if things aren't changed, we may have to attack.
[02:48:11.265 --> 02:48:13.487]  Well, downwind nations aren't going to settle for that.
[02:48:13.527 --> 02:48:20.634]  They're not going to settle for fallout all over their country, contaminating the soil and whatnot.
[02:48:21.181 --> 02:48:25.903]  Then he went on, Kissinger went on to say, look at July 7th.
[02:48:26.043 --> 02:48:27.744]  Look, we've been hit by terrorists, see?
[02:48:28.284 --> 02:48:32.926]  If diplomacy fails... All right, thanks, Alex.
[02:48:33.607 --> 02:48:35.087]  Thank you for the... Anything else?
[02:48:36.788 --> 02:48:40.750]  Can you comment about China, rising China, and military build-up?
[02:48:40.770 --> 02:48:42.831]  Let's not worry about them or the illegal aliens.
[02:48:42.851 --> 02:48:44.652]  Let's just search housewives at checkpoints.
[02:48:45.643 --> 02:48:49.990]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.170 --> 02:48:54.597]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:54.737 --> 02:48:59.144]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.164 --> 02:49:00.526]  The New World Order.
[02:49:02.288 --> 02:49:06.511]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.571 --> 02:49:13.516]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.636 --> 02:49:15.698]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:15.998 --> 02:49:26.345]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:26.365 --> 02:49:27.466]  If you want to understand...
[02:49:27.726 --> 02:49:28.046]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:49:28.106 --> 02:49:29.427]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:49:45.038 --> 02:49:52.563]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:49:52.843 --> 02:50:03.751]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:50:04.011 --> 02:50:04.672]  We're good to go.
[02:50:04.692 --> 02:50:05.032]  I think?
[02:50:20.493 --> 02:50:20.993]  That's right.
[02:50:21.173 --> 02:50:28.296]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:50:28.576 --> 02:50:37.320]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:37.380 --> 02:50:37.840]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:50:45.223 --> 02:50:47.786]  Americans are under a covert medical attack daily.
[02:50:47.826 --> 02:50:51.410]  These chemicals are affecting our brains and may well destroy our society.
[02:50:51.530 --> 02:50:51.911]  Shocking?
[02:50:52.011 --> 02:50:52.471]  Of course!
[02:50:52.732 --> 02:50:54.794]  But what you don't know can indeed kill you.
[02:50:54.954 --> 02:50:57.857]  Big business buries the truth and silences the majority.
[02:50:58.058 --> 02:50:59.419]  Forewarned is forearmed.
[02:50:59.579 --> 02:51:03.844]  Order your copy of the book Secret Assassins of Food by Dr. Ott Ph.D.
[02:51:04.024 --> 02:51:05.426]  only through Mother Earth Minerals.
[02:51:05.606 --> 02:51:10.829]  This 150 plus page milestone gives you more for your money than any other piece of work on this subject.
[02:51:10.929 --> 02:51:23.875]  It should be mandatory in every university that teaches anything about improving your nutrition without all the potions and lotions that are sold to mask over all the problems most folks taught with resulting from the horrible things that are taught as being so good for us.
[02:51:24.015 --> 02:51:31.539]  Also, you will learn about the three foods to avoid at all costs by ordering the book Secret Assassins of Food only from Mother Earth Minerals, Inc.
[02:51:31.739 --> 02:51:34.320]  for only $16.95 plus shipping and handling.
[02:51:34.440 --> 02:51:35.341]  You know, this is how I feel.
[02:51:35.361 --> 02:51:37.562]  I mean, I'm always about facts and information, but you know how I feel.
[02:51:37.582 --> 02:51:38.443]  It's like a joke.
[02:52:05.919 --> 02:52:07.340]  I mean, are we just resigned to the government?
[02:52:35.839 --> 02:52:54.731]  Putting poison in our food, our water, our vaccines, saying they can take our private property, raising our taxes all the time, getting rid of America's sovereignty, putting us into an international body, but because George Bush is in office, everything must be okay because he's got an R before his name?
[02:52:56.672 --> 02:52:57.553]  I mean, I'm angry.
[02:52:58.574 --> 02:53:03.637]  And I feel like I'm just... A lot of times here, with all this evidence, I mean, it's just like I've...
[02:53:06.167 --> 02:53:07.168]  It's overkill.
[02:53:09.229 --> 02:53:13.273]  I mean, for some of you out there that are hearing this and are in denial, I don't know what's wrong with you.
[02:53:13.953 --> 02:53:15.755]  I mean, you should be very upset.
[02:53:15.815 --> 02:53:17.216]  You should be very worried.
[02:53:18.377 --> 02:53:20.258]  Especially people with children.
[02:53:21.139 --> 02:53:27.944]  I mean, none of us are safe with these psychopaths running this global government, this military-industrial complex.
[02:53:28.404 --> 02:53:30.446]  None of us are safe while they're in control of it.
[02:53:32.020 --> 02:53:45.965]  And we're never going to set about turning things around and defeating this world tyranny until we get past the phony left-right paradigm and realize that the global overlords are masters of giving us false choices.
[02:53:47.626 --> 02:53:49.426]  I mean, I want my Second Amendment back.
[02:53:50.187 --> 02:53:52.207]  I don't want 50 million aborted babies.
[02:53:52.828 --> 02:53:54.088]  I don't want open borders.
[02:53:54.688 --> 02:53:56.669]  I don't want to have a transnafta highway.
[02:53:57.575 --> 02:54:01.377]  I don't want illegal aliens to have more rights than citizens.
[02:54:01.977 --> 02:54:03.198]  I don't want gun control.
[02:54:04.058 --> 02:54:05.759]  I don't want a national draft.
[02:54:05.919 --> 02:54:08.320]  I don't want to invade innocent Muslim countries.
[02:54:09.381 --> 02:54:11.362]  The globalists are going to keep carrying out terror.
[02:54:11.402 --> 02:54:16.644]  We're going to keep giving up more of our liberty, and it's going to get worse and worse until we wake up to who's behind it.
[02:54:17.044 --> 02:54:17.965]  Who has the motive?
[02:54:18.885 --> 02:54:20.066]  We've had a war on illiteracy.
[02:54:20.086 --> 02:54:21.006]  There's more illiteracy.
[02:54:21.026 --> 02:54:21.746]  A war on drugs.
[02:54:21.767 --> 02:54:22.587]  There's more drugs.
[02:54:23.286 --> 02:54:24.347]  And more people in prison.
[02:54:24.687 --> 02:54:26.568]  Folks, we're going to have a war on terror now.
[02:54:27.068 --> 02:54:27.648]  Look out.
[02:54:28.109 --> 02:54:35.692]  This is about a powerful elite making you their slaves and doing horrible things to you because they enjoy it.
[02:54:36.973 --> 02:54:38.334]  Because they are the elite.
[02:54:39.194 --> 02:54:43.116]  They see themselves as the rightful rulers because they are ruthless.
[02:54:43.496 --> 02:54:47.479]  They see us that have a conscience and love our families as weak.
[02:54:48.339 --> 02:54:49.560]  Now I say they're weak.
[02:54:49.620 --> 02:54:50.560]  They're a cancer.
[02:54:50.940 --> 02:54:52.101]  They've given in to evil.
[02:54:52.836 --> 02:54:55.278]  They're destroying the entire species.
[02:54:55.718 --> 02:54:57.620]  And they're destroying civilization.
[02:54:59.241 --> 02:55:00.803]  So stuff's going to get worse, folks.
[02:55:00.863 --> 02:55:01.864]  I just hope you know that.
[02:55:03.145 --> 02:55:04.686]  And I hope you realize that.
[02:55:04.726 --> 02:55:06.908]  And I hope you know who to blame as it gets worse.
[02:55:07.428 --> 02:55:12.573]  I'm so sick of seeing the murdering killers stand up there as our saviors in these press conferences.
[02:55:12.993 --> 02:55:14.034]  I mean, it's disgusting.
[02:55:14.414 --> 02:55:15.655]  It's more than I can handle.
[02:55:17.837 --> 02:55:20.019]  And you know in your guts I'm telling the truth.
[02:55:21.783 --> 02:55:37.468]  Before I end this broadcast, if you want a tool to wake up your friends and family, if you want a tool that will inform, if you want a tool to expose the New World Order, then my videos are it.
[02:55:39.268 --> 02:55:42.369]  And Road to Tyranny and Martial Law are both good videos.
[02:55:42.929 --> 02:55:44.190]  They really will wake people up.
[02:55:44.210 --> 02:55:45.710]  They show you who carried out the attacks.
[02:55:46.450 --> 02:55:47.771]  Martial Law is my best work.
[02:55:47.811 --> 02:55:48.751]  I'm actually proud of it.
[02:55:49.529 --> 02:55:54.535]  I hope you'll go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to get it off the secure, safe shopping cart.
