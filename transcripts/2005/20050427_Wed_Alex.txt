[00:00:05.838 --> 00:00:06.479]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:08.220]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:10.021]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.662 --> 00:00:11.502]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.263 --> 00:00:13.364]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.824 --> 00:00:17.487]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.008 --> 00:00:22.151]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.331 --> 00:00:24.252]  Music
[00:00:40.032 --> 00:00:44.053]  Often imitated, unfortunately never duplicated.
[00:00:45.374 --> 00:00:46.834]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:47.454 --> 00:00:50.795]  We'll be here live for the next three hours.
[00:00:50.815 --> 00:00:53.716]  We have several important guests that are going to be joining us.
[00:00:54.576 --> 00:01:02.419]  First off, in about 30 minutes, the group that discovered these giant billboards in Los Angeles...
[00:01:03.169 --> 00:01:10.534]  That is a group that pointed out what they were doing and what they were saying and brought it to the public's attention.
[00:01:11.474 --> 00:01:17.478]  William Gein, the president of Americans for Legal Immigration Reform, PAC.
[00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.361]  And of course they then sent the photos to World Net Daily and others.
[00:01:23.882 --> 00:01:25.343]  What billboard are we talking about?
[00:01:25.463 --> 00:01:30.847]  No, not the Clear Channel billboards that say George W. Bush, our leader.
[00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:41.876]  Looks like something out of Soviet Russia, or out of North Korea today, or out of Saddam's Iraq.
[00:01:41.896 --> 00:01:41.936]  No.
[00:01:43.196 --> 00:01:59.202]  This is Clear Channel, as I talked about yesterday, with a gigantic billboard, and now it's being reported that there are a bunch of these billboards, that say Los Angeles, with California crossed out and Mexico in giant red letters.
[00:02:01.286 --> 00:02:13.455]  And this illustrates so much why is the Fortune 500, why is Wall Street, why is the establishment for breaking up this country and turning people against each other.
[00:02:14.415 --> 00:02:25.643]  Because, I mean, in the Roman handbooks on controlling slaves, you've got to balkanize them within your own empire to manipulate and control them.
[00:02:26.664 --> 00:02:28.065]  Divide and conquer.
[00:02:29.106 --> 00:02:30.807]  It's just that simple.
[00:02:32.321 --> 00:02:37.223]  I mean, Brzezina Brzezinski talks about it in the Grand Chessboard when he calls us slaves.
[00:02:38.404 --> 00:02:43.866]  And they know that most people aren't going to read Roman history books written at the time.
[00:02:43.906 --> 00:02:50.369]  They're not going to read what one of the heads of the Trilateral Commission has to say.
[00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:53.190]  And people are just going to go along with this.
[00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.451]  Well, I'm not going to put up with it.
[00:02:55.177 --> 00:03:20.398]  And I wanted to give listeners a chance to respond to this type of anti-American propaganda from the very people that bring you Lord Limbaugh, who then gives you disinfo and tells you the National ID Card Bill will stop illegals when it actually puts one more major piece in the program of total amnesty.
[00:03:21.457 --> 00:03:28.001]  One large step closer to total legalization of anyone globally coming to this country.
[00:03:29.742 --> 00:03:35.385]  The neocons are just the most deceptive, weasel-like creatures you could even imagine.
[00:03:35.785 --> 00:03:37.266]  Well, that's insulting to weasels.
[00:03:37.326 --> 00:03:38.026]  I shouldn't say that.
[00:03:39.267 --> 00:03:40.748]  But that's just some of what's coming up.
[00:03:40.768 --> 00:03:42.929]  I've got a whole stack of important news here today.
[00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:50.653]  And I'm going to have each one of these guests only on for about 15 minutes, so we have time to take all your calls and cover all the news.
[00:03:52.350 --> 00:04:06.956]  In the second hour, at the start of the second hour, I've got a state rep who sponsored and helped pass this bill in Florida saying that if somebody comes in your house, you're allowed to kill them.
[00:04:08.496 --> 00:04:12.478]  Well, I don't even understand why they need a bill to do that.
[00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:16.179]  I mean, that's already the law in every state in the union.
[00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.220]  At least it was the law.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.921]  The federal government and others have been trying...
[00:04:21.573 --> 00:04:22.654]  Trying to change that.
[00:04:22.774 --> 00:04:27.296]  So we'll find out exactly why they passed this, quote, controversial law.
[00:04:27.996 --> 00:04:39.621]  I guess it's because police over and over again and district attorneys continue to indict people who'd shot knife-wielding or gun-wielding or baseball bat-wielding thugs in their homes.
[00:04:42.022 --> 00:04:42.783]  It's amazing.
[00:04:43.163 --> 00:04:49.886]  We don't want to become like England where you defend yourself as you're being stabbed and you get more prison time than the stabber.
[00:04:51.912 --> 00:04:52.715]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:53.156 --> 00:04:56.647]  Infowars.com, Infowars.net, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:04:56.747 --> 00:04:57.791]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.165 --> 00:05:09.571]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:05:09.831 --> 00:05:14.575]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:05:14.795 --> 00:05:20.479]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:25.223]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:05:25.443 --> 00:05:31.988]  The cashless society control grid, impenetrable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops, mass
[00:05:32.028 --> 00:05:32.228]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:06:01.753 --> 00:06:04.756]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:06:05.096 --> 00:06:13.925]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:06:14.245 --> 00:06:18.930]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:26.097]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:06:26.498 --> 00:06:38.270]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:43.234]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:06:43.395 --> 00:06:45.857]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:45.877 --> 00:06:47.718]  And tell them Alex Jones sends you.
[00:06:47.739 --> 00:06:48.920]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.461]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:06:50.481 --> 00:06:51.542]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:00.683 --> 00:07:02.383]  Soon, the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[00:07:02.583 --> 00:07:04.564]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[00:07:04.784 --> 00:07:05.464]  Prepare yourself.
[00:07:05.644 --> 00:07:09.364]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.
[00:07:09.485 --> 00:07:15.225]  Call toll-free 888-211-1715 and receive the book The Bible Says for free.
[00:07:15.285 --> 00:07:16.666]  There is absolutely no obligation.
[00:07:16.826 --> 00:07:19.426]  No one will call you and your number will not be sold to telemarketers.
[00:07:19.586 --> 00:07:21.146]  We just want to make sure you know the truth.
[00:07:21.387 --> 00:07:24.247]  Get your free book, The Bible Says, by calling toll-free 888-211-1715.
[00:07:24.287 --> 00:07:25.027]  Again, that's 888-211-1715.
[00:07:30.328 --> 00:07:33.929]  Want to know the secret to finding a shop that can keep your car running like new?
[00:07:34.109 --> 00:07:38.011]  Find the cleanest shop in town, where cleaning is top priority.
[00:07:38.151 --> 00:07:41.672]  Not talking about clean floors, but better shops have those too.
[00:07:42.052 --> 00:07:49.635]  I mean shops that have the best training, equipment, and chemistry to clean every air, fuel, and fluid system in your vehicle.
[00:07:49.915 --> 00:07:53.176]  Keep it clean, and you don't have to keep replacing parts.
[00:07:53.616 --> 00:07:57.257]  Find your clean shop at bgfindashop.com.
[00:07:57.517 --> 00:07:59.338]  That's bgfindashop.com.
[00:08:01.489 --> 00:08:03.710]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.131]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:19.756 --> 00:08:24.578]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:26.562 --> 00:08:32.025]  Here we are on this live Wednesday edition, 8 minutes and 30 seconds into this transmission against tyranny.
[00:08:32.045 --> 00:08:38.990]  I'm your wartime broadcaster in the fight against the New World Order.
[00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:43.993]  I don't really want to start the broadcast with this, but it needs to be done.
[00:08:44.593 --> 00:08:45.534]  It needs to happen.
[00:08:47.775 --> 00:08:49.136]  This is from the Drugs Report.
[00:08:51.037 --> 00:08:55.500]  Bush asked about gay splash day beach party.
[00:08:56.115 --> 00:09:03.959]  President Bush raised eyebrows on Tuesday when he asked locals in Galveston, Texas do you still have Splash Day?
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.642]  Splash Day is the annual adult-oriented
[00:09:09.608 --> 00:09:12.390]  Enormous beach party celebration on the Gulf Coast.
[00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:14.692]  Bush, do you still have Splash Day?
[00:09:14.772 --> 00:09:15.152]  Laughter.
[00:09:15.192 --> 00:09:18.635]  Bush, you have to be a baby boomer to know what I'm talking about.
[00:09:18.735 --> 00:09:19.175]  Laughter.
[00:09:19.695 --> 00:09:23.378]  Bush, I'm not saying whether I came or not on Splash Day.
[00:09:24.018 --> 00:09:26.360]  I'm just saying, do you still have Splash Day?
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:34.286]  Bush was unaware Splash Day is now a fully gay and lesbian event on the beaches.
[00:09:36.127 --> 00:09:37.228]  On the Texas beaches.
[00:09:39.181 --> 00:09:44.503]  Folks, I have weighed talking about this and getting into this.
[00:09:45.604 --> 00:09:53.587]  And there was an article in GQ a month ago that got into this.
[00:09:56.028 --> 00:10:06.052]  And the headline of the article was, basically, to paraphrase, you've got to be, quote, gay to be in the Bush cabinet.
[00:10:09.532 --> 00:10:24.024]  And people wonder why these different governors, when 90 plus percent of people in the states are against the electronic toll roads and the tracker chips in your cars, they wonder why they just say, we don't care what we're doing.
[00:10:25.946 --> 00:10:27.227]  I mean, in the past they listened.
[00:10:27.347 --> 00:10:30.129]  It's because of blackmail, predominantly.
[00:10:30.189 --> 00:10:32.771]  Not just campaign contributions.
[00:10:33.252 --> 00:10:33.352]  And
[00:10:36.368 --> 00:10:50.446]  Bush, it is well known, is a member of Skull and Bones, and from very good sources, it has been confirmed that they do engage in homosexual rights at Skull and Bones.
[00:10:50.746 --> 00:10:54.391]  And Bohemian Grove, the adult offshoot...
[00:10:55.649 --> 00:11:00.731]  By adult, people say, well, they're seniors, 21, 22 years old.
[00:11:01.231 --> 00:11:03.712]  They get tapped at the end of their junior year.
[00:11:03.792 --> 00:11:04.893]  They're young men.
[00:11:05.553 --> 00:11:06.973]  It's just a fraternity.
[00:11:07.394 --> 00:11:09.714]  Why, Bush wouldn't be a member of it today.
[00:11:09.734 --> 00:11:16.697]  No, just his father and his father and then his father-in-law of that grandfathered
[00:11:19.798 --> 00:11:44.754]  You can claim that it's just a fraternity, but when they're old men, they go to Bohemian Grove, and I've got the Washington Times, I've got Parade Magazine, Spy Magazine, the New York Daily News, the New York Post, the San Francisco Chronicle, the San Jose Post,
[00:11:45.476 --> 00:11:55.362]  Mercury, the Sacramento Bee, the Santa Rosa Democrat, the Montereo Bohemian, that's what the newspapers call.
[00:11:55.382 --> 00:12:08.910]  I mean, I have a giant file where they just come right out and admit how the Jets land, the top gay porn stars get off, the $1,000, if it was back in the 80s, $2,000 an hour now.
[00:12:13.261 --> 00:12:28.645]  Male prostitutes, the creme de la creme, flying in from Europe, flying in from Latin America, flying in from New York, LA, Chicago, and man, they just load them up on buses with the Secret Service, and they just take them on in.
[00:12:30.865 --> 00:12:35.646]  And they're waiting for them as Henry Kissinger and the whole pack.
[00:12:36.687 --> 00:12:37.467]  It's disgusting.
[00:12:38.867 --> 00:12:42.488]  And yes, the female prostitutes are bussed in, though not at the same level
[00:12:43.562 --> 00:12:44.823]  And I've been there during the festivities.
[00:12:44.843 --> 00:12:48.586]  I was inside for five hours in 2000, and I've been outside the encampment, and I mean, there's so many...
[00:13:14.177 --> 00:13:19.300]  Female prostitutes outside in a small town will make your head spin.
[00:13:21.001 --> 00:13:32.367]  And inside, you know, people ask, Alex Jones, how were you able, with Mike Hanson, to sneak into the Bohemian Grove when you were 27 years old?
[00:13:32.387 --> 00:13:33.367]  31 now.
[00:13:35.028 --> 00:13:37.449]  And Mike was, I guess, about 37 or so.
[00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:41.932]  How were you able to sneak in there when the average age is probably about 65?
[00:13:43.447 --> 00:13:51.549]  When every other news reporter has been caught, when TV crews have been caught and arrested, how were you able to?
[00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:53.390]  Well, God was on our side.
[00:13:55.051 --> 00:13:56.591]  And we were calm and confident.
[00:13:58.151 --> 00:14:10.235]  But quite frankly, the way we got snickered at and approached by the Secret Service and others, and the way they laughed at us and smirked at us, I was a lot better looking in 2000 than I am now.
[00:14:10.255 --> 00:14:11.896]  I was about 35 pounds lighter.
[00:14:12.336 --> 00:14:13.216]  Pretty darn good looking.
[00:14:14.213 --> 00:14:15.996]  And Mike Hans is not a bad looking guy either.
[00:14:16.777 --> 00:14:29.655]  And the way the old men were talking to us and stuff, and inviting us here and there, and of course we would just move on and try to keep moving until it got dark and we could film a ritual, they thought we were fresh meat.
[00:14:32.088 --> 00:14:36.811]  And I never had the intention of, when I was sneaking in there, I never really made that connection.
[00:14:37.251 --> 00:14:39.813]  Because I hadn't researched Bohemian Grove that much at the time.
[00:14:39.853 --> 00:14:42.234]  I mean, I'd probably read 20 news articles about it.
[00:14:42.274 --> 00:14:43.555]  That was really all that existed.
[00:14:43.595 --> 00:14:51.639]  And a lot of them did mention the AIDS problem in the 80s there, and the male prostitutes, but I still wasn't putting two and two together.
[00:14:55.201 --> 00:14:56.262]  But you got Bush.
[00:14:56.722 --> 00:14:57.863]  Folks, Splash Day...
[00:14:59.346 --> 00:15:01.267]  If you live in Texas, you go to the Texas beaches.
[00:15:01.287 --> 00:15:05.108]  I've been going there my whole life for at least 15 years.
[00:15:06.988 --> 00:15:12.890]  Splash Day has been a completely gay and lesbian event.
[00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:16.631]  And it was always a semi-gay and lesbian event.
[00:15:18.171 --> 00:15:20.612]  A lot of people go down to the coast.
[00:15:20.752 --> 00:15:22.492]  I go to the coast three or four times a year.
[00:15:22.913 --> 00:15:25.133]  And you'll know if you're down there at Splash Day.
[00:15:26.654 --> 00:15:28.054]  Especially if you go to Galveston.
[00:15:29.761 --> 00:15:33.243]  Because the people that are going down there get pretty wild.
[00:15:34.664 --> 00:15:37.726]  And it's not the best time for families to go to the beach.
[00:15:38.426 --> 00:15:41.628]  Well, Bush is making his little smirks, his little jokes about it.
[00:15:42.589 --> 00:15:53.956]  Splash Day 15 years ago, back when I was in high school, I'd say maybe 30-40% of it was heterosexual.
[00:15:54.116 --> 00:15:55.997]  Now it's completely homosexual.
[00:15:57.416 --> 00:16:04.539]  And if you're down at the beach during Splash Day, even 15 years ago, there's people all over the place.
[00:16:05.459 --> 00:16:06.860]  You'll get hit on left and right.
[00:16:09.561 --> 00:16:14.923]  Women that were going down there at the time, back when it was still heterosexual to a certain extent, it's just wild.
[00:16:16.023 --> 00:16:21.825]  So regardless, Bush is talking about basically, hey, how's the sex party going?
[00:16:22.125 --> 00:16:23.486]  You still have Splash Day?
[00:16:24.375 --> 00:16:30.577]  Because when you go to the beach for Splash Day, you're going there, unless you go there inadvertently and don't know.
[00:16:30.637 --> 00:16:32.297]  You know, just go, why is everybody acting like this?
[00:16:32.337 --> 00:16:34.098]  Or why are there all these parties on the beach?
[00:16:34.738 --> 00:16:37.539]  You go there, you know what's going on.
[00:16:37.599 --> 00:16:40.340]  You know it is for wild sex.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:48.642]  So regardless, Bush knows it's for wild sex, and he knows full well it's about homosexual sex.
[00:16:50.436 --> 00:16:54.218]  Because clearly, George W. Bush is bisexual.
[00:16:55.059 --> 00:16:55.479]  Clearly.
[00:16:56.279 --> 00:17:03.424]  And we've been getting the reports of this for years, and they just continue to get confirmed, what Sherman Skolnick has documented and others.
[00:17:04.224 --> 00:17:05.705]  I mean, we've got Jeff Gannon.
[00:17:08.012 --> 00:17:23.837]  Regardless of who he really is, in the hardcore porn publications online, a male prostitute, a madam running male prostitutes with the highest level CIA security clearance that ABC News anchors don't get.
[00:17:25.237 --> 00:17:28.218]  You've got him being given his authorization by Karl Rove.
[00:17:28.939 --> 00:17:30.479]  You've got him there at all hours.
[00:17:30.539 --> 00:17:31.559]  I've got the articles from the 80s.
[00:17:34.392 --> 00:17:39.575]  Callboy Network, given midnight tour of White House, underage callboys.
[00:17:39.875 --> 00:17:41.656]  Well, call that what it is, pedophilia.
[00:17:43.037 --> 00:17:48.760]  Barney Frank gets caught with the underage callboys, 15, 16, in his penthouse.
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:56.385]  A callboy ring being run out of his, a pedophile ring being run out of his palatial penthouse.
[00:17:59.406 --> 00:18:00.246]  Didn't get in trouble.
[00:18:00.486 --> 00:18:04.047]  These people are allowed to commit crimes right out in front of us.
[00:18:05.487 --> 00:18:15.449]  And they get to walk around in their little purple ties and the rest of it and sit up there and be our governors and push toll roads when none of us want it.
[00:18:15.949 --> 00:18:17.790]  Because if they don't, it'll all just come out.
[00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:20.950]  It'll all come out.
[00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:24.931]  That's why you have got to basically...
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:33.384]  Compromise yourself one way or the other to be able to join this mafia organization.
[00:18:34.544 --> 00:18:39.107]  And with Clinton, he was being blackmailed with women by the Israelis and others.
[00:18:39.708 --> 00:18:40.248]  That's clear.
[00:18:41.889 --> 00:18:51.196]  But with Bush and his whole crew, they're being blackmailed with their propensity for wanting to have sex with members of the same sex.
[00:18:54.992 --> 00:18:57.434]  It's unbelievable, but it's really true.
[00:18:57.774 --> 00:18:59.676]  And I know it's true.
[00:18:59.696 --> 00:19:03.238]  I mean, if you live here in Austin, you really know it's true.
[00:19:04.579 --> 00:19:05.620]  And I'm sick of it.
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:21.713]  I'm tired of this pack of phony Christians, perverts, running around trying to destroy my country while on their off time they're worshipping Lucifer and...
[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.261]  Having sex with male prostitutes.
[00:19:28.321 --> 00:19:28.941]  I'm tired of it.
[00:19:29.781 --> 00:19:31.182]  And I just thought I'd talk about that.
[00:19:32.582 --> 00:19:41.424]  Now, Bush knows full well what Splash Day is, and perhaps now, you will be ostracized from your church, you will be kicked out of your Baptist church, if you are not homosexual.
[00:19:43.045 --> 00:19:45.225]  Because again, everything Bush does is of the Lord.
[00:19:46.685 --> 00:19:48.206]  Everything he does is of God.
[00:19:49.906 --> 00:19:53.327]  So, lying must be of the Lord, being a homosexual must be of the Lord,
[00:19:54.017 --> 00:19:55.203]  The point is they're complete hypocrites.
[00:20:01.423 --> 00:20:03.064]  Been a while since you've seen the dentist?
[00:20:03.305 --> 00:20:04.145]  Kids need braces?
[00:20:04.345 --> 00:20:05.586]  Can't afford dental care?

[00:21:11.164 --> 00:21:22.387]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:21:22.727 --> 00:21:28.429]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:21:28.689 --> 00:21:29.350]  We're good to go.

[00:22:01.904 --> 00:22:02.445]  Hi, folks.
[00:22:02.505 --> 00:22:04.268]  Jack Browning from Midas Resources.
[00:22:04.548 --> 00:22:05.570]  The real money, folks.
[00:22:08.863 --> 00:22:12.266]  Let's review a few things from the past year, November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:22:12.346 --> 00:22:14.208]  The Dow has ranged from $9,800 to $10,300, a 5% increase.
[00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:20.414]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro, a 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[00:22:30.109 --> 00:22:35.750]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s, a 16% increase in real money.
[00:22:36.351 --> 00:22:39.391]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[00:22:39.951 --> 00:22:45.093]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:47.653 --> 00:22:50.314]  Remember, gold is liquid, private, and portable.
[00:22:50.994 --> 00:22:53.935]  Call now before your buying power shrinks even more dramatically.
[00:22:54.375 --> 00:22:55.795]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.532 --> 00:23:01.652]  Why do you wear watches?
[00:23:01.972 --> 00:23:04.533]  The answer is no longer simply to tell time.
[00:23:05.013 --> 00:23:12.575]  At discountwatchstore.com, watches are as much about telling time as they are about making a fashion statement or showing off one's success.
[00:23:12.935 --> 00:23:16.676]  Watches also make for great heirlooms to pass on for generations to come.
[00:23:17.136 --> 00:23:22.457]  As an authorized dealer of many fine watches, discountwatchstore.com offers fine timepieces.
[00:23:22.797 --> 00:23:23.337]  We're good to go.
[00:23:43.209 --> 00:23:43.570]  That's 866-371-2330.
[00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:43.810]  That's 866-371-2330.
[00:24:05.578 --> 00:24:11.722]  You know, I've got all this really serious news, and I just spent 12 minutes on Bush and his pack of pervert hypocrites.
[00:24:11.822 --> 00:24:12.883]  I mean, it's important because
[00:24:32.498 --> 00:24:34.620]  This is how the globalists control their minions.
[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:36.661]  This is how they've got a total trump over them.
[00:24:37.462 --> 00:24:44.568]  And if they don't play ball and follow orders, suddenly the controlled media starts going, hmm, male prostitutes, hmm.
[00:24:45.268 --> 00:24:48.971]  And then suddenly Bush and his minions all get right back in line.
[00:24:50.532 --> 00:24:54.435]  And it's the same thing with governors smattered around the country.
[00:24:55.676 --> 00:24:56.537]  And I'm tired of it.
[00:24:58.198 --> 00:24:58.839]  I'm tired of it.
[00:24:59.494 --> 00:25:01.154]  That's why you don't want to be corrupt.
[00:25:01.174 --> 00:25:02.215]  That's one of the big reasons.
[00:25:02.795 --> 00:25:04.835]  You cannot be compromised.
[00:25:06.836 --> 00:25:17.238]  And isn't it just classic that there they are up there always on their soapboxes about being moral, but in their true actions it's the opposite.
[00:25:17.278 --> 00:25:21.079]  I mean, Bush, if you look at the judges he's appointing, rabid pro-abortion.
[00:25:22.459 --> 00:25:24.720]  I mean, his attorney general doesn't even want to...
[00:25:25.609 --> 00:25:31.814]  Have the parents have the authority to tell their 12-year-old not to have an abortion or to even be informed of it?
[00:25:32.315 --> 00:25:33.135]  They're 12-year-olds.
[00:25:33.196 --> 00:25:42.183]  But I actually hear Christian Talk Radio imply that Bush may actually be some type of disciple.
[00:25:42.203 --> 00:25:43.724]  He may be a prophet.
[00:25:43.784 --> 00:25:45.306]  He's of the Lord.
[00:25:46.427 --> 00:25:48.388]  Yeah, and the Elzebubs of the Lord then.
[00:25:48.448 --> 00:25:49.950]  I mean, it's amazing.
[00:25:52.792 --> 00:25:52.892]  It's...
[00:25:55.394 --> 00:25:56.094]  I'm speechless.
[00:25:56.655 --> 00:26:09.866]  And GQ a few months ago had this picture of Bush doing this effeminate pose, which he does a lot, and then asked the question, you know, do you have to be gay to be a member of the Bush administration?
[00:26:11.668 --> 00:26:16.792]  And it goes just short of saying Bush is a homosexual.
[00:26:17.453 --> 00:26:19.214]  I mean, it comes a millimeter from it.
[00:26:20.415 --> 00:26:21.456]  A millimeter from it.
[00:26:23.618 --> 00:26:25.699]  You've got to ask yourself, why are they bringing this out?
[00:26:26.059 --> 00:26:29.901]  And right at the point it was about to come out, Bush released those tapes.
[00:26:31.481 --> 00:26:32.842]  Oh, I did drugs and things.
[00:26:32.942 --> 00:26:34.903]  I can't be mean to the gays.
[00:26:36.183 --> 00:26:38.524]  I've sinned too, in case that came out.
[00:26:38.664 --> 00:26:41.566]  See, I've sinned.
[00:26:41.646 --> 00:26:46.528]  See how they're already trying to hedge their bets in case somebody wants to drop that on them?
[00:26:47.468 --> 00:26:51.450]  Anybody they allow in as president, at that level...
[00:26:52.165 --> 00:26:53.806]  It's got dirt on them.
[00:26:53.826 --> 00:26:54.687]  Masses of dirt.
[00:26:56.008 --> 00:27:00.592]  And generally, it's dirt concerning some individual issue.
[00:27:00.612 --> 00:27:08.397]  I mean, they couldn't go after Bill Clinton for missile secrets to the communist Chinese and supercomputers and nuclear reactors in North Korea.
[00:27:08.738 --> 00:27:20.727]  Yes, he lifted the barriers, but it was Bush's buddies, the James Bakers and the Donald Rumsfelds of the world, that were making the money off the transfers and actually doing the deeds.
[00:27:21.531 --> 00:27:33.636]  So, Kenneth Starr, whose law firm represents Hutchinson Wampo, the merchant marine of the Chicoms, he wasn't about as special prosecutor to go after Clinton on any real substantive issue.
[00:27:34.817 --> 00:27:50.463]  The Republican House, that had some good people in it, who were trying to get Clinton, trying to get him out of office and impeaching, they were never allowed to go after real issues, because the big substantive issues were connected to the Republican leadership as well.
[00:27:51.081 --> 00:27:53.063]  Because at that level, it's all the same group.
[00:27:54.264 --> 00:27:56.226]  No, it had to be a dress.
[00:27:58.809 --> 00:28:00.971]  A stain on a dress.
[00:28:01.071 --> 00:28:02.392]  Why did Monica keep that?
[00:28:02.732 --> 00:28:07.357]  Because she was a foreign intelligence service agent.
[00:28:08.258 --> 00:28:10.100]  That's even come out in mainstream news.
[00:28:11.321 --> 00:28:12.542]  Her connections to it.
[00:28:13.723 --> 00:28:15.605]  And Bill Clinton, a sex addict.
[00:28:18.223 --> 00:28:19.544]  Multiple women per day.
[00:28:19.624 --> 00:28:21.204]  Enjoyed raping women as well.
[00:28:22.185 --> 00:28:23.125]  A true animal.
[00:28:24.846 --> 00:28:27.306]  He had a lot of the same tastes that the Grovers have.
[00:28:27.627 --> 00:28:29.067]  A lot of them like to get violent.
[00:28:30.047 --> 00:28:34.229]  He didn't get violent with her, but he did clearly get violent with a lot of other women I've interviewed.
[00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:38.731]  But that's all just ignored, too.
[00:28:38.771 --> 00:28:40.291]  They didn't even go far enough with that.
[00:28:40.331 --> 00:28:47.574]  And then once Bill Clinton left office, George Bush blocked all the investigations that protected him, and now he's a surrogate member of the family.
[00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:51.502]  A member of the Bush crime family.
[00:28:54.124 --> 00:28:55.265]  That's exactly what he is.
[00:28:55.665 --> 00:28:56.826]  That's exactly what he's doing.
[00:28:56.846 --> 00:29:03.211]  All right, we've got a guest coming up to talk about Clear Channel and these Lurican Keystep billboards.
[00:29:04.772 --> 00:29:06.093]  And then we'll get into Gallup Poll.
[00:29:06.633 --> 00:29:10.016]  50% of Americans now say Bush deliberately misled them on WMDs.
[00:29:10.797 --> 00:29:12.618]  Well, I mean, why don't 100% of you know that?
[00:29:13.599 --> 00:29:16.501]  Were HIV-positive foster kids used as guinea pigs?
[00:29:17.392 --> 00:29:19.973]  Well, I don't get how that's a question.
[00:29:20.334 --> 00:29:23.916]  The BBC, New York Daily News, I mean, it's admitted.
[00:29:25.617 --> 00:29:29.359]  They're actually killing children, but we'll... They're government, yeah.
[00:29:30.719 --> 00:29:37.063]  They'll come to a family and say, we're taking your 8-year-old, let us test on him, sign these forms, or I'm taking your 2-year-old.
[00:29:38.044 --> 00:29:42.186]  And these poor black and Hispanic mothers predominantly, that's who they mainly target,
[00:29:43.221 --> 00:29:45.582]  Uh, just give them the older child.
[00:29:46.263 --> 00:29:46.863]  They killed them.
[00:29:46.903 --> 00:29:47.544]  They murdered them.
[00:29:47.584 --> 00:29:50.405]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.906 --> 00:29:52.827]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.307 --> 00:29:54.888]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.908 --> 00:29:58.510]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.841 --> 00:30:04.202]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:30:04.462 --> 00:30:08.304]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[00:30:08.624 --> 00:30:09.445]  Read the labels.
[00:30:09.865 --> 00:30:13.967]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:30:14.207 --> 00:30:18.409]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:30:18.769 --> 00:30:23.651]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:30:24.031 --> 00:30:27.613]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:30:27.813 --> 00:30:33.136]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:30:33.416 --> 00:30:36.157]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:30:36.438 --> 00:30:37.338]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:30:37.638 --> 00:30:48.384]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.
[00:30:48.744 --> 00:30:50.167]  Call Cal-Ben toll-free at 1-800-340-7091.
[00:30:50.187 --> 00:30:51.208]  That's 800-340-7091 or visit calbenpuresoap.com.
[00:31:01.167 --> 00:31:09.432]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:09.693 --> 00:31:14.055]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.336 --> 00:31:23.261]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:23.462 --> 00:31:27.084]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:31:27.364 --> 00:31:32.393]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:32.693 --> 00:31:39.444]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:31:39.925 --> 00:31:40.466]  What about you?

[00:32:03.115 --> 00:32:08.618]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:32:09.038 --> 00:32:13.261]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:32:13.501 --> 00:32:20.505]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:20.905 --> 00:32:27.009]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:27.149 --> 00:32:28.409]  There are no side effects.
[00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:31.671]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:32:31.811 --> 00:32:32.712]  Eliminate the cause.
[00:32:32.792 --> 00:32:33.852]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:32:34.153 --> 00:32:41.397]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:32:41.677 --> 00:32:45.059]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:48.740]  866-885-6625.
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:49.860]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:50.200]  Call today.
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:53.421]  Over the last five years, we probably posted...
[00:33:13.295 --> 00:33:29.606]  Several dozen mainstream news articles from the United States and England, it's the same pattern everywhere, where the government comes and takes healthy children and tests pesticides, medications on them.
[00:33:30.366 --> 00:33:36.510]  I've got scores of articles where they do it in the prisons, but predominantly Texas prisons are really bad.
[00:33:37.071 --> 00:33:39.092]  Out in Huntsville area of East Texas,
[00:33:40.006 --> 00:33:48.470]  And they just are admitting that, okay, we take healthy children and give them pesticides, and sometimes they die, and that's just what CPS does.
[00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:53.292]  And then no one gets indicted, no one goes to jail, nothing happens.
[00:33:53.852 --> 00:33:58.014]  It's like our troops, where they experiment on them with experimental vaccines.
[00:33:58.074 --> 00:34:00.555]  It's illegal to force someone to take that.
[00:34:00.595 --> 00:34:04.677]  I mean, this is the mindset of the people running things, so that's coming up.
[00:34:05.177 --> 00:34:06.438]  And, of course, your phone calls.
[00:34:07.856 --> 00:34:14.982]  Right now, I've got William Geenan, President of Americans for Legal Immigration, and they've got their political action committee.
[00:34:16.002 --> 00:34:26.831]  And yesterday, World Net Daily came out with this article, LA, now Mexico, billboard for TV newscast, as California crossed out nation's name, added Mexico.
[00:34:27.851 --> 00:34:31.374]  And big ol' billboard, I'm getting reports, there's more of these billboards.
[00:34:31.714 --> 00:34:34.296]  This billboard in Los Angeles is 005216.
[00:34:39.236 --> 00:34:49.638]  005216.
[00:34:41.197 --> 00:34:49.638]  And again, Clear Channel has the neoconsul on radio decrying open borders, but saying Bush has got a plan to fix it, which is blanket total amnesty.
[00:34:50.198 --> 00:34:51.058]  Yes, that will fix it.
[00:34:51.078 --> 00:34:52.459]  There won't be any more illegal aliens.
[00:34:53.039 --> 00:35:00.580]  And I've used the example of the analogy of we legalize murder and then change its name to love.
[00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:05.861]  And then we can say there's no more murder in America because we just say it doesn't exist anymore.
[00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:11.573]  That is the same level of deception here.
[00:35:12.914 --> 00:35:16.617]  The neocons tell you, oh, this new national ID card will stop illegals.
[00:35:17.418 --> 00:35:20.260]  Actually orders the states to accept their consul matriculus.
[00:35:20.901 --> 00:35:23.282]  It actually gives us much of the amnesty plan.
[00:35:23.643 --> 00:35:26.745]  The neocons are out saying the evil liberals want to stop our bill.
[00:35:27.225 --> 00:35:31.108]  Oh, they want to enable the illegal aliens.
[00:35:31.128 --> 00:35:31.168]  No.
[00:35:32.509 --> 00:35:36.853]  Bush is the one out there saying that the Minutemen are these evil vigilantes.
[00:35:38.228 --> 00:35:50.251]  But for all the La Reconquista people out there that are listening, you know, reconquer the Southwest, number one, it was never the Aztecs, as you say, the La Reconquista groups like to claim.
[00:35:51.591 --> 00:35:58.533]  And if it belongs to anybody, it belongs to the native indigenous tribes that were here, and that's certainly not any of the tribes.
[00:36:00.166 --> 00:36:07.932]  Tribes that were in southern North America or in what is Mexico today, the Aztecs and the others, the Mayans.
[00:36:10.354 --> 00:36:23.105]  But it was Ford Foundation money, and we have the actual Ford Foundation grants from the early 60s that formed Mecha and La Raza and others, but particularly Mecha.
[00:36:23.999 --> 00:36:30.703]  And it's got the same ideology as the white supremacists and all the other groups, but it's protected and the media says it's okay.
[00:36:31.664 --> 00:36:32.544]  It's the same M.O.
[00:36:32.604 --> 00:36:33.925]  We are the supreme race.
[00:36:34.165 --> 00:36:34.906]  They actually say that.
[00:36:35.666 --> 00:36:37.487]  We are the supreme race.
[00:36:38.368 --> 00:36:43.171]  We should be able to have the entire planet.
[00:36:43.971 --> 00:36:44.972]  We are the best.
[00:36:45.132 --> 00:36:46.613]  We are the god race.
[00:36:47.554 --> 00:36:52.857]  And strangely enough, it says the same thing Louis Farrakhan says, that aliens created them.
[00:36:53.616 --> 00:36:59.061]  Seriously, this is taught in major colleges and funded by the Ford Foundation, especially the U.S.
[00:36:59.081 --> 00:36:59.421]  government.
[00:37:00.963 --> 00:37:05.007]  And it's the same thing that the Nazis said they descended from gods and that they were a mythical race.
[00:37:06.388 --> 00:37:07.929]  And it's just the same M.O.
[00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:15.756]  And I just want to point out to the La Raza and Metro crowds that you are funded by New York.
[00:37:15.817 --> 00:37:17.238]  You are funded by the globalists.
[00:37:17.981 --> 00:37:25.424]  I mean, why is Clear Channel having giant billboards that say Los Angeles, California, across town, and Mexico written over it?
[00:37:26.164 --> 00:37:27.445]  They're playing to that.
[00:37:28.445 --> 00:37:30.366]  And joining us again is William Gein.
[00:37:31.026 --> 00:37:32.507]  Mr. Gein, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:37:32.707 --> 00:37:33.407]  Thanks for having me.
[00:37:34.618 --> 00:37:42.642]  Tell us about how your group discovered these billboards and what you've heard from Clear Channel and what the latest developments are, please.
[00:37:43.002 --> 00:37:48.405]  Well, I need to state up front that Americans Forward Legal Immigration Pack, our main focus is on the U.S.
[00:37:48.445 --> 00:37:51.447]  Congress and Senate and Congressional and Senate campaigns.
[00:37:51.927 --> 00:37:59.231]  We're a political action committee and we believe that 2006 is going to change the nature, behavior, and face of the U.S.
[00:37:59.271 --> 00:38:03.933]  Congress on this issue because it will be the year of the illegal immigration issue.
[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:09.702]  That being said, we have supporters and activists that work very hard around our website.
[00:38:10.182 --> 00:38:13.563]  We don't run just a forum for people to vent.
[00:38:14.624 --> 00:38:22.946]  Our forums share information and news, and we're training activists and volunteers to research and actually take action on issues.
[00:38:23.026 --> 00:38:26.148]  A couple nights ago, I received an email with a photo attached to it.
[00:38:26.528 --> 00:38:27.048]  I wrote back.
[00:38:27.108 --> 00:38:28.148]  I said, where did you get this?
[00:38:28.948 --> 00:38:29.769]  He said, I took it.
[00:38:30.669 --> 00:38:33.230]  He explained he drove down the highway.
[00:38:34.085 --> 00:38:34.365]  I think so.
[00:39:02.955 --> 00:39:10.101]  At which point, I put it up on the website as unconfirmed and turned our activists loose on it.
[00:39:10.141 --> 00:39:14.745]  We confirmed that Clear Channel does own the billboard and that they rent it to some ad agency.
[00:39:15.546 --> 00:39:21.050]  Then we had other people write in saying they've seen the billboard and versions of the billboard in English.
[00:39:22.031 --> 00:39:23.712]  That's the reports.
[00:39:24.313 --> 00:39:29.097]  I've now got some other articles here saying that these billboards are now popping up all over.
[00:39:29.657 --> 00:39:31.299]  I just got a call from a
[00:39:32.012 --> 00:39:32.292]  Yes.
[00:39:32.612 --> 00:39:34.593]  K-A-B-C-T-V in Los Angeles.
[00:39:34.693 --> 00:39:36.313]  The billboard is real.
[00:39:36.713 --> 00:39:41.435]  We announced that it wasn't... I have a leadership directory in the immigration reform movement.
[00:39:41.475 --> 00:39:42.755]  I sent it to them first.
[00:39:43.315 --> 00:39:44.916]  I sent them a follow-up saying, this is no hoax.
[00:39:45.776 --> 00:39:47.096]  Please circulate and distribute.
[00:39:47.336 --> 00:40:00.300]  What our activists do is we're building a network between talk radio show hosts and bloggers and website owners and people who forward emails all around the country to increase sort of an emergency broadcast system
[00:40:00.931 --> 00:40:05.416]  No, you're right, sir.
[00:40:05.496 --> 00:40:11.903]  It is a war, and that's what we, the real media, the new media, the rebel media, are doing.
[00:40:12.424 --> 00:40:13.345]  Black market news.
[00:40:13.405 --> 00:40:15.147]  People shouldn't have to come to us to get this news.
[00:40:15.683 --> 00:40:16.163]  But they do.
[00:40:16.764 --> 00:40:26.289]  Hey, listen, there's a reason the newspapers and TV, TV's lost 45%, newspapers 60 plus percent, the plunge is accelerating.
[00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:27.950]  People are leaving them.
[00:40:28.011 --> 00:40:29.371]  They're tired of being lied to.
[00:40:29.732 --> 00:40:35.315]  Well, it's like a virus that people catch because once people realize what they haven't been told.
[00:40:35.854 --> 00:40:39.257]  They'll never trust some of the traditional media sources again.
[00:40:39.277 --> 00:40:39.637]  That's it.
[00:40:39.677 --> 00:40:40.978]  It's very addictive.
[00:40:41.339 --> 00:40:41.759]  Exactly.
[00:40:41.839 --> 00:40:43.761]  I'm one of the leading addicts.
[00:40:45.002 --> 00:40:49.645]  Well, look, you know, Los Angeles belongs to the United States of America.
[00:40:50.426 --> 00:40:55.370]  And even if that ad was meant tongue-in-cheek in some form or fashion... Believe me, it's not.
[00:40:55.650 --> 00:40:58.653]  Well, a lot of people aren't taking it as tongue-in-cheek.
[00:40:58.713 --> 00:41:04.698]  And there's no response from the station that put that up that says, Your city...
[00:41:05.689 --> 00:41:07.869]  Your team or your city, your station.
[00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:13.090]  And it's addressing Mexico, your city, in Spanish.
[00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:15.511]  Yeah, it says your city.
[00:41:15.531 --> 00:41:18.751]  Tune in to Channel 62 and it says this is Mexico.
[00:41:18.791 --> 00:41:20.672]  We cover the news of Mexico.
[00:41:20.992 --> 00:41:22.132]  Los Angeles, Mexico.
[00:41:22.412 --> 00:41:23.792]  Who signed the deed transfer?
[00:41:26.913 --> 00:41:31.453]  I want to know what I'm seeing that alarms me the most.
[00:41:31.934 --> 00:41:34.374]  And it doesn't matter whether you're a Republican or a Democrat.
[00:41:34.898 --> 00:41:35.418]  We're good to go.
[00:42:03.932 --> 00:42:04.813]  No, you're right.
[00:42:06.053 --> 00:42:09.755]  Under the free trade area of the Americas, I mean, it's in the legislation.
[00:42:09.775 --> 00:42:11.715]  It's the end of America.
[00:42:11.776 --> 00:42:20.879]  We actually go into a Pan-American union, and the neocon talk show hosts will not alert their listeners to it.
[00:42:21.139 --> 00:42:22.020]  Well, we're getting there.
[00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:22.720]  We're getting there.
[00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:24.561]  It's FTAA and CAPTA.
[00:42:24.601 --> 00:42:26.361]  You have to understand incrementalism.
[00:42:26.762 --> 00:42:28.382]  That news will get there.
[00:42:28.422 --> 00:42:28.942]  We're getting there.
[00:42:28.962 --> 00:42:30.403]  At least the nation is finally...
[00:42:30.993 --> 00:42:33.114]  Starting to have a discussion on this issue.
[00:42:33.134 --> 00:42:38.035]  Now, I know that a lot of people out there that are worried sick about this issue are very discouraged.
[00:42:38.055 --> 00:42:41.416]  They're like, you know, we're blocked on the left and we're blocked on the right and these people are calling the shots.
[00:42:41.436 --> 00:42:42.877]  And there's something I want people to understand.
[00:42:42.897 --> 00:42:52.800]  In my opinion, and trust me, to be a supporter of Alleyback, you do not have to share my opinion because we have a very diverse range of people with different views.
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:59.322]  But in my opinion, one of the things that has preserved America and kept it the great nation that it is
[00:43:00.319 --> 00:43:07.021]  The point is, you're talking about major shifts, and you're saying the foundation of the new shift is immigration.
[00:43:07.141 --> 00:43:12.223]  I'm saying that we're in a position that our forebears faced in the Great Depression...
[00:43:28.522 --> 00:43:32.423]  And before that, at the turn of the century, with like Teddy Roosevelt and trust-busting.
[00:43:33.163 --> 00:43:39.825]  When the average people are suddenly confronted with something that happens in history... Well, I would use the example of 1776.
[00:43:39.865 --> 00:43:42.306]  Well, we can keep on going back.
[00:43:43.086 --> 00:43:57.630]  But the truth of the matter is that without going to that level, at the turn of the century and after the Great Depression, a large consensus of American citizens took action civically...
[00:43:58.433 --> 00:44:02.038]  To correct major imbalances in how the country was being run.
[00:44:02.658 --> 00:44:06.103]  About 100 years ago, it was the railroad, not the gas pumps.
[00:44:07.124 --> 00:44:08.286]  And we're at the same position.
[00:44:08.386 --> 00:44:09.847]  I truly believe we're in the same position.
[00:44:09.888 --> 00:44:16.416]  And the reason I'm telling people about this is because I want people to be encouraged because the American spirit has triumphed each time.
[00:44:16.934 --> 00:44:18.075]  Well, let me just add this.
[00:44:18.795 --> 00:44:23.439]  87% of Americans in major polls are against open borders.
[00:44:23.979 --> 00:44:24.760]  68% of Hispanics.
[00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:33.466]  But the media acts like all Hispanics want to destroy America, want La Reconquista, and then acts like that's good and normal.
[00:44:33.966 --> 00:44:40.371]  It is the establishment media trying to get Mexicans to have this idea and to have this view.
[00:44:40.431 --> 00:44:42.112]  So other Hispanics go, yeah!
[00:44:42.472 --> 00:44:43.693]  I better go along with this.
[00:44:43.773 --> 00:44:50.557]  I have Hispanic friends who tell me that illegal aliens will come up and yell at them and say, how dare you not speak in Spanish only?
[00:44:50.837 --> 00:44:52.939]  How dare you not be for La Reconquista?
[00:44:53.279 --> 00:45:07.688]  But it is actually a minority of radical Hispanics that are for this, funded by the Ford Foundation, supported by Bush and the Democrats, and everybody knows that we've already got 30 million illegals here.
[00:45:07.708 --> 00:45:08.449]  I mean...
[00:45:09.209 --> 00:45:10.410]  And it's not just the Hispanics.
[00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:12.072]  It's the Chinese, the Russians.
[00:45:12.452 --> 00:45:14.634]  We always talk about Hispanics because they're the biggest group.
[00:45:14.854 --> 00:45:16.115]  They're all coming here.
[00:45:16.155 --> 00:45:17.516]  They're driving the wages down.
[00:45:17.756 --> 00:45:19.197]  The economy's falling apart.
[00:45:19.437 --> 00:45:22.119]  They're not taking jobs that Americans won't do.
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:23.280]  That's garbage.
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:25.562]  This country is shutting down.
[00:45:25.942 --> 00:45:30.226]  And then we get the IMF World Bank documents where they say this is part of the plan.
[00:45:30.486 --> 00:45:36.851]  So if the people are against it, if it's constitutional to control the borders and kick these illegals out, but
[00:45:37.563 --> 00:45:41.346]  The Republicans and Democrats ignore the will of the people and the Constitution.
[00:45:41.926 --> 00:45:50.312]  Well, let me tell you what I've started saying to people that give me that rhetoric that you're aware of as well, that Americans won't do these jobs.
[00:45:50.392 --> 00:45:55.056]  I'm like, first of all, spare me your lazy American speeches.
[00:45:55.956 --> 00:45:58.558]  I don't want to hear any more lazy American speeches.
[00:45:59.102 --> 00:45:59.562]  Speeches.
[00:46:00.043 --> 00:46:07.968]  Study after study shows that out of the industrialized nations of the world, Americans work longer and harder and more productively than anybody else on this planet.
[00:46:08.448 --> 00:46:09.029]  I don't want to hear it.
[00:46:09.389 --> 00:46:26.060]  Secondly, maybe we do have some problems in our low-skill workforce, but has it ever occurred to anybody that a big chunk of those problems are the drugs that illegal aliens and the gangsters that bring them bring into our country as well?
[00:46:26.545 --> 00:46:33.029]  One of the reasons our low-skilled workforce, white, black, and Latino, is having trouble getting the job done is a lot of them are on crack.
[00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:44.816]  Everybody knows how systematic and endemic the drug problem has become, and a big portion of it is coming from Central and South America, and everybody knows that.
[00:46:44.836 --> 00:46:46.317]  No, you're absolutely right.
[00:46:46.337 --> 00:46:46.997]  Connect the dot.
[00:46:47.037 --> 00:46:53.241]  Now, a congressional quarterly just talked to me, and he said, what would you say to the people who say that, you know, if we...
[00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:54.530]  Right.
[00:46:54.550 --> 00:47:02.375]  I said, well, I think that's a good idea as long as we're willing to legalize the other things that the smugglers are bringing in as well, such as the drugs.
[00:47:11.656 --> 00:47:13.737]  The assault weapons and the rocket launchers.
[00:47:15.298 --> 00:47:17.099]  And the little girls and little boys.
[00:47:17.239 --> 00:47:18.699]  And the child sex slaves.
[00:47:18.759 --> 00:47:20.680]  Let's just make it all legal.
[00:47:20.961 --> 00:47:30.285]  And also any lawmaker that's thinking about this, I want them to practice a real world exercise and find a street in a city, walk down the block two or three days in a row handing out $5 bills.
[00:47:30.625 --> 00:47:32.146]  Tell me what it's like on the fourth day.
[00:47:33.807 --> 00:47:38.409]  Tell me how many people swarm you on the fourth day.
[00:47:39.403 --> 00:47:41.823]  You don't reward lawlessness.
[00:47:41.844 --> 00:47:45.564]  You don't reward behavior that you want to discourage.
[00:47:46.084 --> 00:47:51.265]  If you have a problem with aggressive panhandling in your community, walk down there and hand out cash a couple days and see how it goes.
[00:47:51.685 --> 00:47:52.946]  They'll be waiting on you next time.
[00:47:53.686 --> 00:48:01.687]  Well, I cut my finger off and I went to the hospital and the illegal aliens went right past me because they know they don't have insurance.
[00:48:02.008 --> 00:48:06.168]  They've been ordered to take care of them, but people that have insurance get treated like garbage.
[00:48:07.569 --> 00:48:09.009]  If the American...
[00:48:09.847 --> 00:48:11.489]  Couch potato, as they call us.
[00:48:12.029 --> 00:48:28.805]  The aging white American, 20 pounds overweight crowd, doesn't get off the recliner, doesn't put down the remote and the mouse and pick up the phone and come to the table with time and money and energy.
[00:48:29.746 --> 00:48:30.146]  We're done.
[00:48:31.327 --> 00:48:31.928]  We are done.
[00:48:32.521 --> 00:48:34.743]  I don't think people travel to the third world.
[00:48:34.843 --> 00:48:36.724]  We are going to become the third world.
[00:48:37.024 --> 00:48:38.906]  That's the official plan.
[00:48:39.326 --> 00:48:40.807]  They don't want a middle class in this.
[00:48:40.867 --> 00:48:43.109]  Look, I've had the head of the Border Patrol on the head of the union.
[00:48:43.449 --> 00:48:45.110]  He said it is a new world order.
[00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:47.091]  It is to destroy our sovereignty.
[00:48:47.412 --> 00:48:48.592]  That is the plan.
[00:48:49.733 --> 00:48:51.875]  Anybody who's researched this knows it.
[00:48:52.495 --> 00:48:55.998]  And here's my last question for you, Mr. Gein.
[00:48:56.018 --> 00:48:59.560]  We'll fire out your website a couple times and tell folks how to support your wonderful organization.
[00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:00.041]  Thank you, sir.
[00:49:00.341 --> 00:49:02.002]  We've got these billboards going up.
[00:49:03.283 --> 00:49:04.943]  The establishment is behind this.
[00:49:05.023 --> 00:49:06.604]  The neocons are pushing this.
[00:49:08.945 --> 00:49:14.106]  I mean, how do we get the message across to people that the establishment wants this?
[00:49:14.686 --> 00:49:17.447]  And just any other comments about this disgusting billboard?
[00:49:17.647 --> 00:49:18.947]  I mean, it should be removed.
[00:49:19.067 --> 00:49:19.988]  It is traitorous.
[00:49:21.048 --> 00:49:27.510]  First thing people have to do, you might have some first-time listeners or people hearing this for the first time, you've got to tie into the black market news economy.
[00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:29.450]  If you don't have a web connection, get one.
[00:49:29.790 --> 00:49:32.611]  Or find a talk radio station or a local cable station online
[00:49:33.012 --> 00:49:36.074]  Our cable show that runs once a week that you can depend on to get this news.
[00:49:36.615 --> 00:49:37.235]  Find the news.
[00:49:37.295 --> 00:49:38.056]  Inform yourself.
[00:49:38.236 --> 00:49:39.857]  Second, forward that information.
[00:49:40.397 --> 00:49:41.838]  Tell people you work with.
[00:49:42.198 --> 00:49:43.259]  Go to family members.
[00:49:43.639 --> 00:49:44.400]  Go to friends.
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:45.601]  Go to your neighbors.
[00:49:45.621 --> 00:49:47.982]  The power of taking action is unstoppable.
[00:49:48.243 --> 00:49:54.927]  Look, you've got to go to people you know and say, Look, I didn't want to believe this horse and larky, but it's true.
[00:49:55.928 --> 00:49:57.089]  It's absolutely true.
[00:49:57.169 --> 00:49:59.851]  This is what President Martin of Canada says.
[00:50:00.551 --> 00:50:01.492]  European Union, yes.
[00:50:02.503 --> 00:50:04.545]  It's not some tinfoil hat conspiracy.
[00:50:05.486 --> 00:50:06.087]  It is true.
[00:50:06.447 --> 00:50:07.909]  And what are we going to do?
[00:50:07.929 --> 00:50:09.150]  I can't deal with it.
[00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:09.991]  It's too horrific.
[00:50:10.031 --> 00:50:10.531]  What do we do?
[00:50:10.891 --> 00:50:12.253]  We do what our forebears did.
[00:50:12.273 --> 00:50:14.956]  They got off the couch.
[00:50:16.017 --> 00:50:21.202]  They got involved in a civic way and they used the system or what remains of the system
[00:50:21.687 --> 00:50:24.889]  Because here in North Carolina, they just tried for in-state tuition for illegal aliens.
[00:50:25.049 --> 00:50:25.389]  I know.
[00:50:25.609 --> 00:50:26.389]  That's on the run.
[00:50:26.730 --> 00:50:29.531]  I declared that a dead political duck last night.
[00:50:29.671 --> 00:50:30.612]  Well, look at Orrin Hatch.
[00:50:30.632 --> 00:50:33.453]  He wants to give more tuition to illegals than citizens get.
[00:50:33.693 --> 00:50:34.594]  We can win this fight.
[00:50:34.794 --> 00:50:35.674]  We won it before.
[00:50:36.115 --> 00:50:37.235]  We're going to preserve our nation.
[00:50:37.595 --> 00:50:38.136]  We can do it.
[00:50:38.336 --> 00:50:39.216]  Give us the website.
[00:50:40.297 --> 00:50:46.180]  www.alipac.us Say what?
[00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:46.480]  Stay there.
[00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:48.321]  I've got one more question for you on the other side.
[00:50:50.183 --> 00:50:51.383]  This billboard, folks.
[00:50:51.483 --> 00:50:52.324]  They're announcing.
[00:50:53.384 --> 00:50:54.524]  This is Mexico.
[00:51:01.666 --> 00:51:06.027]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.167 --> 00:51:10.648]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.768 --> 00:51:15.169]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:15.189 --> 00:51:16.549]  The New World Order.
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:22.542]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.602 --> 00:51:29.547]  We've ripped the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and revealed the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.667 --> 00:51:31.748]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:32.028 --> 00:51:42.574]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.674 --> 00:51:46.717]  If you want to understand what the new rule of order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Polisco,
[00:51:46.817 --> 00:51:46.937]  888-253-3139.

[00:52:01.824 --> 00:52:04.827]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:52:05.167 --> 00:52:13.996]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:52:14.316 --> 00:52:19.001]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:19.461 --> 00:52:26.165]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:52:26.566 --> 00:52:38.333]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:38.833 --> 00:52:43.295]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:52:43.455 --> 00:52:45.916]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:52:50.538 --> 00:52:51.599]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[00:54:10.995 --> 00:54:11.995]  Cotton of ice.
[00:54:12.335 --> 00:54:13.336]  The big banks.
[00:54:14.877 --> 00:54:16.398]  Multinational corporations.
[00:54:18.357 --> 00:54:24.500]  Openly saying they're going to de-industrialize and turn America into at least a second world nation.
[00:54:25.881 --> 00:54:28.922]  The middle class is their enemy, regardless of what color you are.
[00:54:28.942 --> 00:54:37.206]  They're going to use slave labor from China, millions of people working in these private prisons, and the illegal aliens to drive the wages down to nothing.
[00:54:37.947 --> 00:54:39.047]  The race to the bottom.
[00:54:39.087 --> 00:54:43.530]  They laugh about it and say, you've had too much freedom and too much money far too long.
[00:54:43.890 --> 00:54:46.151]  Then you'll go to the government and beg for whatever jobs...
[00:54:46.934 --> 00:54:56.577]  They'll give you, or the corporations will give you, that'll be in these new sectors of the economy that are, quote, Homeland Security, that watch and spy on the American people, but leave the borders wide open.
[00:54:57.857 --> 00:55:15.443]  Talking to William Gein, President of Americans for Legal Immigration PAC, and his group, of course, first reported and exposed these billboards, put up by Clear Channel, same folks that put up giant billboards saying, Our leader, George W., like we're North Korea or something,
[00:55:16.668 --> 00:55:21.091]  Just classic, the neocon controllers out there pushing and selling us.
[00:55:21.111 --> 00:55:34.643]  And I want to, again, reach out to the Lorican Kista crowd, who I've been able to deprogram, and say, if Whitey's so evil, and you're fighting the establishment, well then why is the establishment going along with what you want?
[00:55:35.704 --> 00:55:35.744]  Uh...
[00:55:37.455 --> 00:55:49.082]  How important is that illusion, William Gein, that Hispanics want open borders when even in the polls the vast majority don't, but the media continues this illusion that that's what they want?
[00:55:49.682 --> 00:55:55.245]  Well, one thing about illusions, Alex, is they don't stand up to the truth if you keep repeating it over and over again.
[00:55:55.265 --> 00:55:57.827]  Smokescreens and aspersions fade.
[00:55:58.467 --> 00:56:00.428]  And that's what's happening right now in this country.
[00:56:00.889 --> 00:56:06.612]  People will call us nasty names and practice La Raza techniques to try and shut down the debate.
[00:56:07.048 --> 00:56:18.510]  But we've learned online and other places, the longer this debate goes, the louder it gets, the more than 90% of true Americans that stand with us notice the conflict and become involved.
[00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:21.591]  And to the recon conquistas or whatever, I have a message.
[00:56:21.611 --> 00:56:22.851]  You're going to lose.
[00:56:23.671 --> 00:56:25.312]  You're messing with Americans.
[00:56:25.852 --> 00:56:31.813]  You're messing with the greatest nation to ever exist on Earth, one of the lifeboats of the world.
[00:56:32.753 --> 00:56:36.234]  And our technologies and culture and political systems have
[00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:39.612]  For the reasons there are 6.5 billion people on this planet right now.
[00:56:40.293 --> 00:56:42.094]  And we're a kind and generous people.
[00:56:42.815 --> 00:56:43.976]  We are a loving people.
[00:56:44.757 --> 00:56:48.019]  But we know when we're being exploited and when we're being abused.
[00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:49.620]  And that's about to end.
[00:56:50.861 --> 00:57:01.510]  That's about to end because about 10% or less of the population, if you count the lackeys of the elite corporations and liberals in the media and the
[00:57:02.259 --> 00:57:06.583]  Minority of legal Hispanics that support illegal aliens.
[00:57:09.025 --> 00:57:14.169]  You're not going to prevail against 85-90% of the American citizenry.
[00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:15.530]  And it's on.
[00:57:16.191 --> 00:57:19.334]  And my best recommendation to the Reconquistas is to find a new vocation.
[00:57:20.334 --> 00:57:20.755]  Immediately.
[00:57:21.616 --> 00:57:22.837]  To reassess your position.
[00:57:23.337 --> 00:57:26.039]  Listen, we had our Mayor Gus Garcia before he left office.
[00:57:26.059 --> 00:57:26.900]  I have this on video.
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:27.501]  I put it on TV.
[00:57:28.391 --> 00:57:36.458]  He had a proclamation of the supreme race, the god race, the space race, of Hispanics.
[00:57:36.478 --> 00:57:42.082]  I mean, imagine if whites were having a god race thing on TV in Austin.
[00:57:42.463 --> 00:57:50.049]  Well, it's tough enough to have to deal with illegal aliens, but dealing with illegal alien aliens, that's just, you know, that's quite a bit.
[00:57:50.109 --> 00:57:55.834]  And my grandfather and his brothers took care of the Nazis in the Ardennes Forest.
[00:57:56.094 --> 00:57:57.135]  And my great-grandfather...
[00:57:58.001 --> 00:58:00.102]  But I mean, the mayor is saying that they are space alien god races.
[00:58:00.122 --> 00:58:00.802]  I have it on video.
[00:58:00.822 --> 00:58:02.423]  I'm sure you're aware of this bizarre nomenclature.
[00:58:02.523 --> 00:58:05.845]  Well, it's very similar to the Nazi cult of fuel.
[00:58:05.865 --> 00:58:07.525]  And I'm just saying, we've dealt with Nazis before.
[00:58:27.509 --> 00:58:31.152]  We can deal with them again, even if they're reconquista Nazis.
[00:58:31.392 --> 00:58:33.413]  Fire out that website again.
[00:58:34.114 --> 00:58:38.117]  www.allypac.us, A-L-I-P-A-C.us.
[00:58:38.537 --> 00:58:45.302]  We also have a toll-free number, which I don't recommend you call anytime today, which is 866.
[00:58:46.463 --> 00:58:47.584]  Call in the evening if you can, 866-329-3999.
[00:58:47.624 --> 00:58:47.924]  Thank you.
[00:58:57.916 --> 00:58:58.557]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.217 --> 00:59:00.278]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.999 --> 00:59:02.099]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:03.621]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.321 --> 00:59:05.202]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.222 --> 00:59:09.545]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.086 --> 00:59:14.209]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.371 --> 00:59:24.837]  90 plus percent of us don't want toll roads and tracker chips in all our cars, but Republicans and Democrats universally try to force us to take them.
[00:59:25.595 --> 00:59:33.859]  Upwards of 90% of the American people don't want open borders, no illegal immigration is killing this country, but the Republicans and Democrats all want it.
[00:59:35.019 --> 00:59:39.881]  Many Americans don't want these phony wars, but the establishment Republicans and Democrats want it.
[00:59:41.422 --> 00:59:46.384]  The vast majority of Americans don't want abortion, but still, Bush appoints all these pro-abortion people.
[00:59:47.525 --> 00:59:49.325]  I mean, it goes on and on and on.
[00:59:50.186 --> 00:59:52.647]  And in the last hour, we were talking predominantly about
[00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:55.361]  Los Angeles, California.
[00:59:55.981 --> 00:59:57.502]  Having the California crossed out.
[00:59:57.542 --> 01:00:01.924]  And, well, it's Mexico, and that's what Clear Channel and TV stations are out promoting.
[01:00:01.964 --> 01:00:03.985]  Hey, this is Mexico.
[01:00:05.065 --> 01:00:05.905]  We're taking over.
[01:00:06.326 --> 01:00:07.006]  Ha, ha, ha.
[01:00:07.066 --> 01:00:14.069]  But you're talking about an organization owned by Lowry Mays, the big, fat, white guy.
[01:00:14.747 --> 01:00:15.828]  Now, why do they want this?
[01:00:15.908 --> 01:00:24.633]  To break down this country, to drive down the wages, so the economy implodes, so they can buy everything up for pennies on the dollar, and so there's no middle class threatening them.
[01:00:27.174 --> 01:00:27.835]  Unbelievable.
[01:00:28.035 --> 01:00:36.139]  And if you just joined us, you heard the last segment, and I'm talking about Mayor Gus Garcia.
[01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:39.261]  Before he left office a few years ago, I have this on video.
[01:00:39.321 --> 01:00:40.522]  I've heard it many times on TV.
[01:00:42.116 --> 01:00:43.237]  I ought to put that on the website.
[01:00:43.257 --> 01:00:44.997]  I wish I had a bigger staff to get all this done.
[01:00:45.397 --> 01:00:46.938]  My staff does a great job, but they're overwhelmed.
[01:00:47.478 --> 01:00:48.119]  I've heard it many times.
[01:00:48.179 --> 01:00:53.101]  I heard that again next week when I did the TV show along with this article about the billboard.
[01:00:53.661 --> 01:01:06.787]  And, I mean, it's about five minutes long, and they call up members of METCHA, and Gus Garcia goes into the proclamation of the God race and the supreme race, the old powerful race.
[01:01:07.587 --> 01:01:09.868]  And I'm sitting there watching this,
[01:01:11.201 --> 01:01:20.205]  Can you imagine, folks, if any other group was saying they were the supreme race, and that space aliens created them, and that they were taking over?
[01:01:20.225 --> 01:01:23.386]  I mean, I've been on radio interviews in L.A.
[01:01:23.426 --> 01:01:31.710]  where members of these groups were openly saying, we're going to kill you, we're going to drive you out, we're going to go back to Europe, and you know, blah, blah, blah.
[01:01:33.031 --> 01:01:34.091]  And it's acceptable.
[01:01:34.171 --> 01:01:37.373]  It's like it's normal for the media, not for the general public.
[01:01:37.773 --> 01:01:38.173]  And again...
[01:01:38.866 --> 01:01:41.169]  The majority of Hispanics are against this.
[01:01:42.110 --> 01:01:45.193]  But this is something being pushed, and it is growing.
[01:01:45.814 --> 01:01:49.337]  Because the media continues to act like it's the normal thing and everybody's for it.
[01:01:49.938 --> 01:01:52.761]  And so some people who are weak-minded go, okay, well then I better be for it.
[01:01:53.932 --> 01:01:56.913]  Chris in Illinois, then we've got a state rep coming on.
[01:01:57.573 --> 01:01:58.274]  Chris, go ahead.
[01:01:58.574 --> 01:01:59.194]  Hi.
[01:01:59.574 --> 01:02:01.075]  I recently saw a movie.
[01:02:01.475 --> 01:02:08.638]  Well, I do agree with you about the illegal immigration that the Bush administration is just taking the illegal moniker off of the word.
[01:02:09.298 --> 01:02:16.600]  But I recently watched a movie called Hotel Rwanda, and it was about the genocide that took place in Rwanda.
[01:02:16.821 --> 01:02:17.861]  Did it admit the U.N.
[01:02:17.881 --> 01:02:18.141]  did it?
[01:02:18.421 --> 01:02:18.661]  Yes.
[01:02:19.502 --> 01:02:19.622]  Wow.
[01:02:21.736 --> 01:02:26.220]  So what I did was I went to Google and I wanted to research the subject a little more.
[01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:28.081]  So I went to Google and typed in genocide.
[01:02:28.101 --> 01:02:43.773]  Well, the first thing that popped up was, I mean, the most detailed scientific study out of Yale University that on genocide, they know the who's, what's, where's, how many people, who was involved, who did it, why it happened.
[01:02:44.634 --> 01:02:50.038]  And our president has gone to this school, is in a
[01:02:51.091 --> 01:02:52.211]  The order of death.
[01:02:53.312 --> 01:03:02.674]  I have reason to suspect that what our government is doing is actively trying to perfect genocide.
[01:03:03.435 --> 01:03:07.436]  Dick Cheney says we need to legitimize the use of race-specific weapons.
[01:03:08.116 --> 01:03:10.197]  And he also loves the little reconquista.
[01:03:10.717 --> 01:03:17.179]  What I also did yesterday, and my friend called me a weak link in the Infowars, I made a sign.
[01:03:18.655 --> 01:03:19.295]  We're good to go.
[01:03:40.658 --> 01:03:44.021]  People were coming up to me and asking me, and they were agreeing with me.
[01:03:44.421 --> 01:03:45.422]  Oh, everybody knows.
[01:03:46.083 --> 01:03:46.463]  Stay there.
[01:03:46.483 --> 01:03:48.745]  I've got a guest coming on, but he's only going to come on for one segment.
[01:03:49.005 --> 01:03:50.326]  Then we'll get back to you.
[01:03:50.346 --> 01:03:50.767]  Stay with us.
[01:03:53.456 --> 01:03:54.957]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:55.157 --> 01:03:58.239]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:58.379 --> 01:04:02.281]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:02.321 --> 01:04:06.563]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State to the Takeover.
[01:04:06.904 --> 01:04:10.686]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:10.766 --> 01:04:12.627]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:13.227 --> 01:04:16.130]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[01:04:16.170 --> 01:04:20.874]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:21.034 --> 01:04:24.077]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:24.257 --> 01:04:27.119]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:33.745]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:34.265 --> 01:04:34.706]  We're good to go.
[01:04:52.748 --> 01:04:56.230]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:04:56.491 --> 01:04:59.993]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:05:00.093 --> 01:05:04.035]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:05:04.256 --> 01:05:10.420]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:18.745]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:05:19.125 --> 01:05:24.490]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum.
[01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:28.414]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:28.794 --> 01:05:30.616]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:05:30.696 --> 01:05:32.878]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:05:33.118 --> 01:05:33.479]  Normally $48.
[01:05:34.519 --> 01:05:37.700]  You get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:43.462]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[01:05:43.862 --> 01:05:44.462]  Protect your family.
[01:05:51.531 --> 01:05:58.156]  For some time now, many people have heard of the benefits of Oregosin, Oreganol, Oregomax, and the many under-health products from North American Urban Spice.
[01:05:58.517 --> 01:06:08.645]  Dr. Cass Ingram has stated, Extracts of wild oregano, notably the P7-3 oil, and particularly the P7-3 Oregosin, completely obliterate the human cold virus in 20 minutes in one dose.
[01:06:09.305 --> 01:06:10.766]  With a 100% kill.

[01:06:44.264 --> 01:06:45.305]  Big Brother Mainstream Media
[01:07:01.235 --> 01:07:02.336]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.976 --> 01:07:03.836]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.576 --> 01:07:05.457]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.477 --> 01:07:09.758]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.319 --> 01:07:14.480]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:16.601 --> 01:07:25.685]  I've been interviewed in England, Germany, Ireland, Scotland over a hundred times, many times about the Second Amendment.
[01:07:26.225 --> 01:07:28.966]  And they're always aghast when...
[01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:38.495]  They talk about our right, our God-given right, our inalienable right to blow somebody away who comes in our house or who tries to carjack us.
[01:07:39.515 --> 01:07:42.036]  They're so domesticated, so brainwashed.
[01:07:42.077 --> 01:07:48.340]  And since they've taken all their guns in England, their crime rate has been doubling each year consecutively for the last five.
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:49.841]  Yet that's their actual numbers.
[01:07:50.181 --> 01:07:54.303]  Until now, England has the second highest crime rate in the industrialized world.
[01:07:54.363 --> 01:07:58.265]  We have the 14th highest of the 15 industrialized nations.
[01:07:58.506 --> 01:07:59.046]  Did you know that?
[01:07:59.688 --> 01:08:05.752]  Our murder rate is higher because we do have some gang-related shootings and things that are entered into the statistics.
[01:08:06.573 --> 01:08:11.757]  But when it comes to just muggings and attacks and stabbings, it's the general public under this in England.
[01:08:12.137 --> 01:08:28.989]  And I was talking to Representative Dennis K. Baxley there in the break when we just got him on, and he says he's been on in England, and they're just aghast that he has helped spearhead this great legislation that Jeb Bush, we have to credit him, did sign.
[01:08:29.921 --> 01:08:33.663]  Yesterday, Bush signs bill allowing meeting of force with force.
[01:08:34.424 --> 01:08:38.646]  And I just asked the representative during the break, I said, why do you even need this?
[01:08:38.686 --> 01:08:41.928]  Doesn't the Florida Bill of Rights say you can defend yourself?
[01:08:41.948 --> 01:08:43.248]  I know the Texas Bill of Rights does.
[01:08:43.609 --> 01:08:44.649]  I know most states do.
[01:08:45.130 --> 01:08:46.310]  The federal Bill of Rights does.
[01:08:46.991 --> 01:08:52.854]  And he said, well, no, actually, they put a clause in the law that you have to retreat.
[01:08:53.635 --> 01:08:56.497]  Well, you can't retreat when you're in your car and somebody's trying to carjack you.
[01:08:56.517 --> 01:09:09.588]  There have been countless reports from Illinois, North Carolina, New York especially, L.A., where somebody comes in your house, is attacking you, you get a gun, shoot them, and because you shoot them five times, they indict you.
[01:09:10.589 --> 01:09:16.754]  And I remember interviewing the 85-year-old, I think it was 86-year-old a few years ago, in North Carolina.
[01:09:18.286 --> 01:09:20.107]  Retired railroad worker.
[01:09:20.307 --> 01:09:21.508]  Two thugs broke into his house.
[01:09:21.608 --> 01:09:22.508]  One of them had a gun.
[01:09:23.489 --> 01:09:24.550]  He shot and killed one.
[01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:25.350]  The other ran.
[01:09:25.410 --> 01:09:26.831]  He shot him before he left the house.
[01:09:27.351 --> 01:09:28.332]  So they arrested him.
[01:09:29.212 --> 01:09:32.394]  So that's why Representative Dennis K. Baxley has helped get this law passed.
[01:09:32.434 --> 01:09:33.975]  And I can only commend him.
[01:09:33.995 --> 01:09:35.076]  And this shows the power.
[01:09:35.656 --> 01:09:40.619]  Bush may be selling us out at the federal level, trying to be anti-gun, appointing all these people.
[01:09:41.391 --> 01:09:49.958]  But at the state level, we can really get good Republicans to do the right thing, and I can only commend this Republican, Representative Dennis K. Baxley.
[01:09:50.018 --> 01:09:51.339]  Representative, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:09:51.979 --> 01:09:52.760]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:53.780]  I appreciate that.
[01:09:53.981 --> 01:10:04.609]  And to add insult to injury to some of those home invasion cases, the families of this perpetrator are then suing the property owner because they got hurt on your property.
[01:10:05.529 --> 01:10:10.153]  So this bill also, that's a little caveat that has not been discussed, but that also...
[01:10:10.783 --> 01:10:11.903]  Is in this bill, too.
[01:10:11.923 --> 01:10:16.344]  Well, there was a case in California where the thief fell through the skylight and sued them.
[01:10:17.124 --> 01:10:17.364]  Right.
[01:10:17.824 --> 01:10:18.684]  Just that kind of mess.
[01:10:19.685 --> 01:10:20.665]  So that's in the bill, too.
[01:10:21.665 --> 01:10:21.945]  Yes.
[01:10:22.025 --> 01:10:27.666]  Well, the three major features of the bill is, number one, to canonize the Castle Doctrine.
[01:10:27.886 --> 01:10:36.088]  It's been practiced in Florida in terms of case law and in terms of common law, but it's never been canonized in Florida statute.
[01:10:36.168 --> 01:10:37.128]  So we're doing that.
[01:10:37.168 --> 01:10:38.708]  But if somebody breaks into your home
[01:10:39.532 --> 01:10:50.276]  You have the right to presume that they're coming in there to do bodily harm, and you can use whatever force is necessary, including deadly force, to stop them to protect your home, family, and property.
[01:10:50.416 --> 01:10:53.718]  Please explain, for those that don't know, what canonize means.
[01:10:54.518 --> 01:10:56.299]  Well, it's putting it in our statute.
[01:10:56.479 --> 01:11:05.142]  Rather than just relying on a legal concept that's been carried forward through common law, it's placing it in a Florida statute so that it's on the book.
[01:11:06.332 --> 01:11:14.160]  And that statute can be used to defend you should somebody attempt to take that right for you to defend your home away from you.
[01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:23.269]  Here's a Texas example, and then I want to get into the bill and tell folks how they can go to your website and check out the legislation and hopefully pass it in their state if it's not canonized there as well.
[01:11:23.569 --> 01:11:25.811]  Here's another example for those that don't understand this concept.
[01:11:26.272 --> 01:11:29.155]  CPS has been taking people's children in Texas...
[01:11:29.415 --> 01:11:29.655]  Absolutely.
[01:11:29.675 --> 01:11:31.055]  It's the best way to make certain.
[01:11:31.075 --> 01:11:34.516]  The second part of that bill also extends to automobiles in the modern day.
[01:11:34.556 --> 01:11:34.696]  The
[01:11:57.338 --> 01:11:59.100]  Please go over the bill for us.
[01:12:11.164 --> 01:12:21.108]  What if you're getting in your car at the shopping mall where most of these carjackings just seem to happen or on some dark city street and then they come up and try to attack you?
[01:12:21.128 --> 01:12:26.390]  That's where the third part of the bill is most beneficial because any place that you have a right to be
[01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:48.924]  You can have coverage of this bill that says you have a right to stand your ground and defend yourself to meet force with force.
[01:12:49.004 --> 01:12:51.726]  Because your body really is your house.
[01:12:52.546 --> 01:12:54.167]  That's the most important piece of property.
[01:12:54.747 --> 01:13:05.133]  And you're most likely to be attacked in a parking lot or somewhere rather than inside your car or in your home because they're looking for the vulnerable victim that they can take advantage of.
[01:13:05.805 --> 01:13:14.410]  Wasn't there a Florida case last year where the woman had a little 25 and she was jogging and the guy tried to rape her and she blew him away?
[01:13:14.730 --> 01:13:19.873]  And the police even discussed trying to do something to her, but then the lawmakers got involved and they didn't?
[01:13:20.173 --> 01:13:21.394]  I think that was a Florida case.
[01:13:22.834 --> 01:13:30.198]  Those kind of things do happen frequently here because the present law before this bill, which will become law in October...
[01:13:32.166 --> 01:13:37.988]  It did require, it has in it a duty to retreat if there's some way you could have avoided and left.
[01:13:38.008 --> 01:13:50.631]  Of course, they'd like to have the prosecutor have about 60 to 90 days to sort out and mull over whether he thought you might have had a way to get away when, in fact, you've got two or three seconds to make a decision on whether you want to live or die.
[01:13:50.791 --> 01:13:55.352]  In my view, running away in that kind of situation is a good way to get shot in the back.
[01:13:57.168 --> 01:14:03.150]  Well, I mean, every woman in Florida, especially, needs, frankly, to have a gun and to be able to defend herself.
[01:14:03.610 --> 01:14:10.552]  I mean, since Florida put in the concealed carry, what, your carjackings and violent crime dropped, what, 25%?
[01:14:12.433 --> 01:14:13.353]  Well, and it has.
[01:14:13.473 --> 01:14:21.336]  I mean, back in 87, we passed the right to carry legislation, and since we did that,
[01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:24.722]  Well, and everybody, the same hysterical things were out there.
[01:14:24.742 --> 01:14:25.963]  We're going to have blood in the street.
[01:14:25.983 --> 01:14:27.164]  The world's going to end.
[01:14:27.925 --> 01:14:29.126]  And instead, what did we have?
[01:14:29.186 --> 01:14:31.648]  We had a serious reduction in violent crime.
[01:14:31.688 --> 01:14:33.569]  And I predict this bill will do the same.
[01:14:34.050 --> 01:14:39.534]  Some woman won't be raped because she has now the encouragement and confidence to defend herself.
[01:14:39.854 --> 01:14:41.255]  Some child won't be abducted.
[01:14:41.776 --> 01:14:44.298]  And some murder victim will not be a statistic.
[01:14:44.438 --> 01:14:45.118]  They will live.
[01:14:46.238 --> 01:14:47.699]  No, you're saving a lot of lives.
[01:14:47.739 --> 01:14:53.424]  I mean, I would say that over the next decade, Representative, you spearheading this, I mean, frankly, you've saved thousands of people.
[01:14:54.465 --> 01:14:58.449]  Well, I sure pray so, and of course we hope those things don't ever occur.
[01:14:58.991 --> 01:15:11.435]  But I think just taking a stand, again, and drawing a clear line in the sand that we're going to stop crime in its track, we're going to stand behind victims when they're attacked, is a very important message for a safe society.
[01:15:12.055 --> 01:15:13.155]  I mean, what spurred this?
[01:15:13.235 --> 01:15:20.178]  Just all the cases where, I mean, of course you obviously saw the cases around the country where they were indicting people who defended themselves.
[01:15:20.998 --> 01:15:24.439]  Well, most recently we had a case after the hurricane here in the Panhandle
[01:15:24.952 --> 01:15:25.352]  We're good to go.
[01:15:25.392 --> 01:15:25.893]  We're good to go.
[01:15:51.642 --> 01:15:52.242]  Absolutely.
[01:15:52.282 --> 01:15:53.203]  So it does three things.
[01:15:53.223 --> 01:15:58.405]  It says you can defend yourself in your car, you can defend yourself, obviously, in your home, but also anywhere, basically.
[01:15:58.425 --> 01:16:02.547]  I mean, what's the specifics with talking about your personage?
[01:16:03.487 --> 01:16:05.248]  Well, it's meet force with force.
[01:16:05.308 --> 01:16:06.448]  That's the limiting factor.
[01:16:06.488 --> 01:16:08.549]  If somebody yells at you, all you do is yell back.
[01:16:08.709 --> 01:16:10.630]  If they poke you with their finger, you can poke them back.
[01:16:11.230 --> 01:16:14.652]  If they pull out weaponry and come at you to kill you,
[01:16:15.376 --> 01:16:23.686]  And you have very substantial reason to believe that they're there to kill you or cause you serious bodily injury, then you're covered.
[01:16:23.866 --> 01:16:33.237]  Also, people forget we've got over 20,000 gun laws in this country that regulate firearms and weaponry, and those are still in force.
[01:16:33.317 --> 01:16:35.540]  I frequently hear about the bar fight.
[01:16:36.147 --> 01:16:42.889]  Well, in Florida, if you walk in a bar with a firearm, you're committing a felony already, so you're not protected.
[01:16:42.970 --> 01:16:49.572]  If you're doing anything unlawful, you're trading drugs, you're street fighting gangs, you're escalating a domestic quarrel,
[01:16:50.736 --> 01:16:53.678]  Then that is not the type of protection we're looking at.
[01:16:53.698 --> 01:16:54.759]  Well, here's an example.
[01:16:55.259 --> 01:16:57.500]  Six years ago, I walked out of the TV station.
[01:16:57.581 --> 01:16:59.041]  Four thugs attacked me.
[01:16:59.061 --> 01:17:00.242]  It was political.
[01:17:01.023 --> 01:17:03.664]  And they hit me first, and I fought back.
[01:17:03.704 --> 01:17:10.889]  And when the police got there, they watched the surveillance camera tape and debated arresting me, because I gave better than they gave after I got going.
[01:17:11.449 --> 01:17:12.249]  I'm not bragging here.
[01:17:12.289 --> 01:17:13.209]  I was defending myself.
[01:17:13.529 --> 01:17:15.250]  You tend to do that when four guys are attacking you.
[01:17:15.770 --> 01:17:20.351]  And one of the cops was debating arresting me, and the senior officer that got there said, no, we can't.
[01:17:20.711 --> 01:17:21.991]  But she said, well, we could.
[01:17:22.051 --> 01:17:26.812]  I mean, she was actually acting like I was bad for defending myself.
[01:17:26.852 --> 01:17:31.793]  But under this law, if somebody hauls off and punches me, if I was in Florida, I could punch them back.
[01:17:31.953 --> 01:17:34.334]  Because I see the cases all the time where they arrest both people.
[01:17:35.154 --> 01:17:36.874]  It's about meeting force with force.
[01:17:36.974 --> 01:17:40.275]  And if you're under violent attack, you can defend yourself under this act.
[01:17:41.730 --> 01:17:45.054]  I mean, it's important to... I'm surprised we had to clarify that.
[01:17:45.614 --> 01:17:49.319]  Well, and self-defense should be such a natural common sense thing.
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:18:01.853]  But for many people, they've just been fed so much propaganda about... I mean, I had one of these guys come on the air on a talk show and say, you know, the Florida's awash in guns and...
[01:18:02.413 --> 01:18:03.814]  And it's simply not true.
[01:18:03.994 --> 01:18:18.884]  And since 1987, when we did provide the permit to carry into a weapon law, less than one-tenth of 1% of those permit holders have ever had any kind of problem whatsoever.
[01:18:19.682 --> 01:18:32.453]  And so that just shows you that law-abiding citizens who want to work with the rules, who want to hold the line against chaos in their society, they can be trusted if you support them.
[01:18:32.953 --> 01:18:35.536]  They will do a good job helping you hold the line.
[01:18:36.116 --> 01:18:47.720]  Where you have a problem is all the unenforced laws where they're soft on criminals and they're not prosecuting people who are felons and are committing felonies by having guns and ignoring all the gun laws.
[01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:51.341]  Representative Dennis K. Stay there, Representative.
[01:18:51.902 --> 01:18:52.402]  We've got a break.
[01:18:52.422 --> 01:18:53.082]  Stay there one more second.
[01:18:54.858 --> 01:18:55.238]  We're good to go.
[01:19:16.540 --> 01:19:16.900]  We're good to go.

[01:20:53.061 --> 01:20:56.442]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.

[01:21:54.838 --> 01:21:58.960]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:21:59.060 --> 01:22:01.960]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:08.742]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:22:08.922 --> 01:22:11.943]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:22:12.143 --> 01:22:14.544]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:22:14.644 --> 01:22:19.365]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove
[01:22:19.565 --> 01:22:34.137]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as atrazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform, MTBE, radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[01:22:34.297 --> 01:22:40.983]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of black murky purification elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[01:22:43.985 --> 01:22:59.534]  All right, our final segment with Representative Dennis K. Baxley.
[01:22:59.554 --> 01:23:04.457]  You can go to myflorida.gov and just type in Baxley into the search engine.
[01:23:04.937 --> 01:23:13.122]  You'll get his page and also links to some of the legislation he's been sponsoring and getting signed into law in the state of Florida.
[01:23:14.011 --> 01:23:15.551]  And I was talking to him during the break again.
[01:23:16.132 --> 01:23:17.312]  Those are always the best interviews.
[01:23:17.692 --> 01:23:24.413]  We were talking about the ten states out there that do have these compulsions to, quote, retreat.
[01:23:24.834 --> 01:23:27.194]  How do you retreat when you're in your house and you've got your children?
[01:23:27.494 --> 01:23:32.215]  How do you retreat out the side door of your car?
[01:23:32.595 --> 01:23:35.056]  You can't do it in the three seconds you've got to react.
[01:23:35.940 --> 01:23:36.801]  It's amazing.
[01:23:37.202 --> 01:23:39.264]  We have a responsibility to defend ourselves.
[01:23:39.664 --> 01:23:45.411]  So check out your state and see if you have this order to retreat and try to get this legislation passed in your area.
[01:23:46.132 --> 01:23:56.163]  But, Representative, to see the insane response of our media calling it vigilantism, to see the response of the foreign press, you were telling me about that during the break.
[01:23:57.193 --> 01:23:57.573]  Yes, sir.
[01:23:57.613 --> 01:24:15.577]  We've been on some of the Scandinavian countries and also with Britain, and I'll tell you, they have been so propagandized that they're not supposed to defend themselves, that they're just horrified that anybody has a view of self-defense and weaponry of being able to defend themselves, which is a heritage of this country.
[01:24:15.597 --> 01:24:25.619]  Of course, we got quite a feud with the BBC when we said, well, we thought we settled this back in 1776 when we explained to you folks that we intend to protect ourselves and our own
[01:24:26.454 --> 01:24:28.116]  And so it got kind of fiery.
[01:24:28.516 --> 01:24:38.204]  But the fact is that we have a very special right and a great heritage of freedom in this country, and that's why I do legislation like this.
[01:24:38.284 --> 01:24:41.087]  It's about freedom, and a lot of people are afraid of freedom.
[01:24:41.127 --> 01:24:42.688]  They want control by their government.
[01:24:43.228 --> 01:24:48.171]  But you need that freedom if we're going to have the kind of heritage that was given to us.
[01:24:48.471 --> 01:24:58.496]  Well, it's a broken record, but if you look at Chicago, New York, the places with the most gun control, they have the highest crime rates because all the criminals go there because it's the happy hunting ground.
[01:24:58.936 --> 01:25:03.478]  It's where they've got all the defenseless victims, and we're winning the Second Amendment debate.
[01:25:04.099 --> 01:25:09.041]  It's very true that if guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.
[01:25:09.521 --> 01:25:12.843]  You can see the footage of these street criminals in the
[01:25:13.623 --> 01:25:22.385]  And then the governments will prosecute people that defend themselves with an old, hidden 80-year-old shotgun than they will the person that was attacking them.
[01:25:22.405 --> 01:25:23.945]  I wonder why those governments do that.
[01:25:37.373 --> 01:25:40.936]  Well, it really is all about criminalizing the whole idea.
[01:25:40.976 --> 01:25:50.385]  They think the gun or the firearm is the criminal element rather than those people who would perpetrate harm against others.
[01:25:51.025 --> 01:25:57.031]  And it's just a whole twisted train of thought that gets started, and it's hard to undo it once it gets started.
[01:25:57.071 --> 01:25:59.933]  But those governments are armed to the teeth against their population.
[01:25:59.973 --> 01:26:01.635]  They just don't want the good people being armed.
[01:26:02.398 --> 01:26:02.899]  That's true.
[01:26:03.519 --> 01:26:12.627]  Well, you're right about there's about ten states that we were one of that went so far as to put this duty to retreat language in form.
[01:26:12.708 --> 01:26:20.875]  So you really ought to look at your state legislature or go to the NRA website and see if you've got some problems in that area that you can work on legislatively.
[01:26:20.995 --> 01:26:24.959]  I know that they're very interested in using this foothold in Florida
[01:26:26.053 --> 01:26:30.817]  Well, that's great.
[01:26:30.978 --> 01:26:33.240]  They said that they're doing something good for a change.
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:40.047]  They said that we would have blood in the streets, end of the world, mass murder everywhere, the assault weapons ban expired.
[01:26:40.507 --> 01:26:46.353]  Now it's expired for five months, and the crime rate's actually gone down.
[01:26:47.617 --> 01:26:49.658]  Well, isn't freedom a dangerous thing?
[01:26:50.579 --> 01:26:55.782]  Well, Representative Dennis K. Baxley, I appreciate you coming up with this bill and sponsoring it and getting it passed.
[01:26:56.442 --> 01:27:07.829]  And I would like to see you guys get a new concealed permit carried, a pass that is Vermont style, because that will even cause your crime rate to go down even further.
[01:27:08.502 --> 01:27:26.555]  I mean, I know these concealed carries are a stopgap, but they do kind of turn a right into a privilege, and overall I think it's a dangerous trend, though the stopgap has caused crime to go down in the 20-plus states that have passed these, so I can only commend you and your colleagues for doing something that is truly conservative and pro-American.
[01:27:26.975 --> 01:27:32.899]  MyFloridaHouse.gov, and folks can go there to the website and find the legislation.
[01:27:32.939 --> 01:27:35.281]  How do they find the legislation on the website?
[01:27:36.801 --> 01:27:41.166]  When you go there, there'll be a program for LEGIS.
[01:27:41.507 --> 01:27:49.077]  It's called LEGIS, L-E-A-G-I-S, so you can pull up any kind of action on the bills, copies of the bills, how they were voted.
[01:27:49.617 --> 01:27:51.640]  It's a very self-guided website.
[01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:54.584]  The bill was called LEGIS, but what's the bill number?
[01:27:56.799 --> 01:27:58.240]  This is 289, House Bill 289.
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:01.402]  HB 289.
[01:28:01.862 --> 01:28:01.402]  249, 249.
[01:28:02.843 --> 01:28:03.123]  HB 249.
[01:28:03.484 --> 01:28:04.524]  Right.
[01:28:04.624 --> 01:28:06.266]  All right, Representative.
[01:28:06.646 --> 01:28:07.626]  Actually, thank you for coming on.
[01:28:08.267 --> 01:28:09.988]  Thank you, and you have a great day in Texas.
[01:28:10.268 --> 01:28:10.849]  You too, sir.
[01:28:11.369 --> 01:28:11.729]  Bye-bye now.
[01:28:11.909 --> 01:28:20.916]  Now, folks, that's why we've got to get real members into our state legislatures.
[01:28:22.617 --> 01:28:24.118]  That's where the power lies.
[01:28:25.530 --> 01:28:33.613]  And you see Bush up there with all his gun grabbing, appointing all these gun grabbers to powerful positions, judgeships, cabinet positions.
[01:28:34.393 --> 01:28:37.954]  Meanwhile, at the state level, we're making some progress.
[01:28:38.014 --> 01:28:41.015]  But at the state level, we're also losing a lot of key battles.
[01:28:41.315 --> 01:28:42.055]  I'll tell you about those.
[01:28:43.976 --> 01:28:44.896]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.356 --> 01:28:46.957]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.977 --> 01:28:50.558]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.610 --> 01:28:59.737]  Do you have $10,000, $20,000, $30,000 or more in credit card debt that's suffocating your bank account and your lifestyle?
[01:28:59.857 --> 01:29:04.782]  If you think bankruptcy is the only way out, then pay close attention because relief is on the way.
[01:29:05.003 --> 01:29:06.404]  Debt Relief USA at 800-509-3201.
[01:29:09.207 --> 01:29:10.970]  I owed so much of my credit card debt.

[01:30:16.314 --> 01:30:25.682]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkeys patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.

[01:31:29.283 --> 01:31:34.687]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.

[01:32:10.454 --> 01:32:13.157]  We're not going to back down on our national sovereignty.
[01:32:13.177 --> 01:32:15.580]  We're not going to back down on the open borders.
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:17.963]  We're not going to back down on abortion, the murder of children.
[01:32:18.843 --> 01:32:24.965]  We're not going to back down on Bush being a satanic devil worshiper, a member of Bohemian Grove and Skull and Bones.
[01:32:24.985 --> 01:32:29.146]  We're not going to back down on what the New World Order is up to and the false left-right paradigm.
[01:32:29.386 --> 01:32:31.587]  We're not going to back down on these phony wars.
[01:32:31.607 --> 01:32:32.847]  We're going to expose them.
[01:32:33.447 --> 01:32:38.588]  We're not going to back down on any of these key issues, the private run-for-profit, Federal Reserve.
[01:32:39.589 --> 01:32:40.429]  We're not going to stop.
[01:32:40.709 --> 01:32:43.890]  We're not going to back down on how dangerous genetic engineering is.
[01:32:44.818 --> 01:32:58.710]  Coming out now with human genes in the rice that you're going to be eating, vaccines built into the foods, into the potatoes, cockroach genes in the tomatoes, salmon genes in the corn.
[01:32:59.070 --> 01:33:03.734]  We're not going to back down on exposing the real environmental threat that is genetic engineering.
[01:33:04.917 --> 01:33:19.469]  We're not going to back down when it comes to exposing the false environmental movement controlled by the Carnegie and Ford and Rockefeller Foundations admittedly to steal private property for the criminal corporations that are not free market and the real estate associations that support it and manipulate it.
[01:33:20.010 --> 01:33:21.171]  We're not going to back down.
[01:33:21.191 --> 01:33:22.792]  We're going to shatter the false paradigm.

[01:33:32.985 --> 01:33:44.249]  We're not going to back down when it comes to the federal government's own policy to break down the family, to force drugs, and force psychologically test, and to double the number of children stolen from families each year.
[01:33:44.269 --> 01:33:49.891]  We're not going to back down when it comes to how they're killing them, testing drugs and pesticides on children that they've stolen.
[01:33:50.311 --> 01:33:53.434]  We're not going to back down when it comes to government-run white slavery rings.
[01:33:53.714 --> 01:34:00.079]  We're not going to back down on the implantable microchips that they're pushing to make law enforcement accept and take.
[01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:06.084]  We are not going to back down on the transponders in the cars and the toll roads that go into all the major roads in the country.
[01:34:06.345 --> 01:34:07.686]  We are not going to back down.
[01:34:08.306 --> 01:34:09.087]  We have the people.
[01:34:09.387 --> 01:34:10.368]  We have common sense.
[01:34:10.768 --> 01:34:11.989]  We have God on our side.
[01:34:12.029 --> 01:34:13.631]  We are not going to stop.
[01:34:14.341 --> 01:34:15.362]  We are the sane.
[01:34:15.702 --> 01:34:16.623]  We are the normal.
[01:34:16.883 --> 01:34:17.784]  We are the decent.
[01:34:18.005 --> 01:34:20.567]  We are the people that love, that do not hate.
[01:34:21.788 --> 01:34:22.969]  We're going to stand up and fight it.
[01:34:23.490 --> 01:34:26.012]  I know Chris and Adam and many others have been holding for a while.
[01:34:26.072 --> 01:34:30.056]  Your calls are coming up for the Balance the Broadcast interspersed with key news items.
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:31.000]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:31.080]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:38.983]  I haven't been taking as many calls Monday and Tuesday because I've been busy with guests and news, but we're going to shift back now into news and your calls.
[01:34:39.003 --> 01:34:40.263]  Toll-free number 1-800-259-9231.
[01:34:40.283 --> 01:34:43.284]  Before I go back to your calls and some of this other important news...
[01:34:53.855 --> 01:34:58.036]  I do really want to, you know, I try to speed past my videos.
[01:34:58.536 --> 01:35:07.397]  I try to hurriedly babble about them, and I really don't spend enough time elaborating on just how important these documentaries are.
[01:35:08.578 --> 01:35:09.638]  I've made 12 films.
[01:35:09.878 --> 01:35:11.038]  My 12th is my best.
[01:35:11.658 --> 01:35:16.839]  It is Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[01:35:18.279 --> 01:35:22.380]  My 9th film is my second best film, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:35:24.286 --> 01:35:25.787]  But my 12th film is my best.
[01:35:26.147 --> 01:35:27.187]  And, of course, it's my longest.
[01:35:27.708 --> 01:35:32.050]  Three hours long, three films in one on DVD.
[01:35:33.210 --> 01:35:33.951]  More than three films.
[01:35:33.971 --> 01:35:35.571]  Really, four films in one on DVD.
[01:35:35.612 --> 01:35:37.853]  Three films in one on the VHS version.
[01:35:37.993 --> 01:35:40.454]  Two and a half, two hours, 35 minutes.
[01:35:41.774 --> 01:35:44.356]  Three plus hours with the extras on the DVD.
[01:35:45.997 --> 01:35:48.838]  And I could talk for hours about this film, but I'm not going to.
[01:35:49.198 --> 01:35:50.299]  You need to have it.
[01:35:50.699 --> 01:35:53.040]  The power of you, the listener...
[01:35:54.617 --> 01:35:57.178]  Breaking the controlled propaganda monopoly.
[01:35:57.699 --> 01:35:58.679]  Getting my video.
[01:35:58.779 --> 01:35:59.860]  Making 10 copies.
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:00.500]  10 days.
[01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:02.561]  If it's VHS or DVD.
[01:36:03.602 --> 01:36:04.362]  Make 10 copies.
[01:36:04.402 --> 01:36:05.503]  Make a copy every night.
[01:36:06.783 --> 01:36:13.347]  Give it to your police chief, your county commissioner, your local talk show host, your pastor, your neighbor, but mainly opinion makers.
[01:36:13.487 --> 01:36:15.128]  Or maybe you want to make 20 copies.
[01:36:16.168 --> 01:36:18.910]  Dedicate yourself in the next 20 days to make a copy every night.
[01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:20.461]  And then to give it to somebody.
[01:36:20.521 --> 01:36:21.142]  Or go further.
[01:36:21.482 --> 01:36:22.763]  Air it on AXS TV.
[01:36:22.823 --> 01:36:23.624]  It's easy to do.
[01:36:24.144 --> 01:36:25.465]  Or do your own TV show.
[01:36:25.525 --> 01:36:27.387]  Set up your own web blog.
[01:36:28.608 --> 01:36:33.913]  If you've become a member of PrisonPlanet.tv, monthly and yearly subscriptions, 15 cents a day.
[01:36:35.935 --> 01:36:39.658]  Sign up via PayPal or credit card on our secure, safe shopping cart.

[01:36:47.694 --> 01:37:08.240]  Of my 220-something page book, 9-11, The Sentence of Tyranny, Paul Watson's 300-something page book, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsor Terror in the New World Order, all 12 of my films, hundreds of weekly TV reports, dozens of special reports, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of my best audio interviews of my guests, prisonplanet.tv.
[01:37:08.660 --> 01:37:09.101]  Go there!
[01:37:10.001 --> 01:37:13.782]  Download copies of my films, burn them on DVDs, what, like 50 cents apiece?
[01:37:14.804 --> 01:37:15.965]  Burn them on the DVDs.
[01:37:16.085 --> 01:37:18.606]  It's not the super quality, but it's pretty good quality.
[01:37:18.886 --> 01:37:19.566]  Burn those.
[01:37:19.626 --> 01:37:20.586]  Make copies that way.
[01:37:21.187 --> 01:37:22.167]  Burn ten copies.
[01:37:22.287 --> 01:37:23.467]  Take a couple hours.
[01:37:23.828 --> 01:37:24.708]  Give those to people.
[01:37:25.408 --> 01:37:29.430]  I get calls all the time from the YMCA in New Haven, Connecticut.
[01:37:30.090 --> 01:37:31.291]  Or the YMCA in Austin.
[01:37:31.311 --> 01:37:33.471]  I've gotten two YMCA calls.
[01:37:33.531 --> 01:37:34.452]  Car dealerships.
[01:37:34.712 --> 01:37:35.532]  Apartment complexes.
[01:37:35.812 --> 01:37:38.754]  Mr. Jones, stop putting your videos on car windows.
[01:37:39.334 --> 01:37:40.754]  Or we'll call the police on you.
[01:37:41.435 --> 01:37:42.215]  I go, I don't live in
[01:37:42.938 --> 01:37:43.819]  New Haven, Connecticut.
[01:37:43.879 --> 01:37:45.201]  I do live in Austin, Texas.
[01:37:46.722 --> 01:37:48.064]  The call from Austin was nicer.
[01:37:48.765 --> 01:37:51.408]  Because the guy's a fan, Mark Keister.
[01:37:52.329 --> 01:37:53.050]  The guy that runs it.
[01:37:53.290 --> 01:37:54.131]  At least it was about a year ago.
[01:37:54.451 --> 01:37:56.433]  Alex, you put hundreds of copies on all the windshields.
[01:37:56.754 --> 01:37:58.275]  Well, I didn't do that, Mr. Keister.
[01:37:58.295 --> 01:37:59.477]  It's really his name.
[01:37:59.497 --> 01:37:59.837]  Funny name.
[01:38:00.117 --> 01:38:00.638]  Interesting guy.
[01:38:01.219 --> 01:38:01.299]  Uh...
[01:38:03.101 --> 01:38:04.342]  No, somebody else is doing that.
[01:38:04.642 --> 01:38:05.883]  I get calls from New Zealand.
[01:38:06.383 --> 01:38:10.645]  Someone spray-painted Infowars.com 200 feet across on a skyscraper.
[01:38:10.685 --> 01:38:11.466]  Please don't do that.
[01:38:11.786 --> 01:38:12.667]  Well, I didn't do that.
[01:38:12.707 --> 01:38:13.567]  I'm not saying do that.
[01:38:15.388 --> 01:38:19.551]  But the point is that you're having an effect.
[01:38:19.591 --> 01:38:26.334]  But burn these copies or buy the high-quality digital DVD or the high-quality analog VHS.
[01:38:27.695 --> 01:38:28.856]  Make copies from that.
[01:38:30.285 --> 01:38:32.847]  The power of you doing it is unbelievable!
[01:38:34.529 --> 01:38:36.631]  And yes, the film is already having a massive effect.
[01:38:37.472 --> 01:38:41.315]  But more of you need to get involved to really have the big effect.
[01:38:42.476 --> 01:38:45.259]  I pointed out that you can put it on all the file sharing networks.
[01:38:45.319 --> 01:38:46.520]  I know it's on hundreds already.
[01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:47.361]  That's not enough.
[01:38:47.381 --> 01:38:52.966]  It needs to be on all of them and uploaded repeatedly and given interesting names so that people will visit it.
[01:38:55.359 --> 01:38:56.660]  And quite frankly, we're in a war.
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:03.224]  What you do is you name it something of a popular movie that's about to come out, and millions will be searching that title and find it.
[01:39:03.925 --> 01:39:05.286]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:07.747 --> 01:39:13.371]  Perhaps you should call it the real Star Wars Revenge of the Sith.
[01:39:13.391 --> 01:39:15.993]  Because that's what the globalists basically are.
[01:39:16.453 --> 01:39:18.755]  And the millions that are out there looking for it online will.
[01:39:19.275 --> 01:39:22.037]  I mean, I give you these ideas that listeners have given me.
[01:39:22.597 --> 01:39:23.658]  I just want to get the word out.
[01:39:24.318 --> 01:39:25.159]  For free to people.
[01:39:26.447 --> 01:39:27.508]  That's all I want.
[01:39:27.608 --> 01:39:29.089]  I could care less about money.
[01:39:29.769 --> 01:39:34.512]  And I hear these money grabbers out there with their magic products and all their garbage.
[01:39:34.532 --> 01:39:35.773]  It just makes me want to puke.
[01:39:36.353 --> 01:39:38.274]  I'm about real information, folks.
[01:39:39.515 --> 01:39:41.856]  And I just want you to have these films.
[01:39:41.976 --> 01:39:42.557]  Please get them.
[01:39:43.137 --> 01:39:46.799]  I mean, I've lowered the price of some of my films because I want you to get them.
[01:39:46.839 --> 01:39:54.644]  I mean, you can get American Dictators, which is a great video, covering Bohemian Grove, 9-11, the staged election, all of it.
[01:39:55.532 --> 01:39:58.835]  For $5.95 when you buy one copy for $9.95.
[01:39:59.395 --> 01:40:00.296]  Each edition is $5.95.
[01:40:00.476 --> 01:40:06.360]  You want to give somebody the nice color cover, the hard case, the plastic wrapper around it.
[01:40:06.580 --> 01:40:08.562]  They're more apt to watch it if you give it to them like that.
[01:40:09.763 --> 01:40:10.523]  Makes a great gift.
[01:40:11.284 --> 01:40:13.766]  I've got some of my other films that low in price.
[01:40:14.286 --> 01:40:17.108]  I just want to get it out to people.
[01:40:17.789 --> 01:40:18.649]  That's all I want.
[01:40:18.709 --> 01:40:19.710]  I mean, go to the website.
[01:40:20.591 --> 01:40:22.212]  Burn off copies of my book.
[01:40:22.788 --> 01:40:24.449]  And a Paul Watson's book on CDs.
[01:40:24.509 --> 01:40:25.209]  Give it to people.
[01:40:25.329 --> 01:40:27.430]  I just want to get out there.
[01:40:27.470 --> 01:40:28.631]  I just want to warn people.
[01:40:29.371 --> 01:40:30.472]  My family depends on it.
[01:40:30.492 --> 01:40:31.553]  Your family depends on it.
[01:40:32.153 --> 01:40:33.453]  We've got to save this country.
[01:40:33.494 --> 01:40:34.394]  These people are bad.
[01:40:34.454 --> 01:40:36.375]  The globalists are really evil folks.
[01:40:36.795 --> 01:40:37.976]  They're really sadistic.
[01:40:38.016 --> 01:40:44.359]  They enjoy what they do, and we can kick their hind ends with God's help if you'll take action.
[01:40:45.740 --> 01:40:47.661]  Please get martial law.
[01:40:48.101 --> 01:40:49.021]  It's my best work.
[01:40:49.182 --> 01:40:50.022]  Call right now.
[01:40:50.572 --> 01:40:50.692]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:40:50.712 --> 01:40:50.852]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:40:50.872 --> 01:40:52.173]  One copy is $25.95 on VHS or DVD.
[01:40:52.193 --> 01:40:53.333]  Second copy, $19.95.
[01:40:53.553 --> 01:40:53.954]  Third copy, $16.95.
[01:40:54.394 --> 01:40:54.674]  Fourth copy, $14.95.
[01:40:54.814 --> 01:40:55.434]  Down to $14 a piece.
[01:40:55.674 --> 01:41:00.397]  If you want to support us, people always want to donate, and I say, no, I don't ask for donations.
[01:41:00.417 --> 01:41:01.177]  It happens, and we thank you.
[01:41:01.197 --> 01:41:01.657]  It really helps.
[01:41:01.717 --> 01:41:03.198]  No, we just want you to get our materials.
[01:41:03.238 --> 01:41:03.878]  That's how you donate.
[01:41:20.802 --> 01:41:22.524]  But if you don't have the money, I understand.
[01:41:23.645 --> 01:41:28.150]  Get somebody to give you a copy that has one, and you go make copies of it.
[01:41:28.430 --> 01:41:34.056]  And if you don't have money to make copies, charge four bucks for it, the copy you made.
[01:41:34.176 --> 01:41:34.836]  I don't care.
[01:41:35.057 --> 01:41:39.001]  I just want to get the information out.
[01:41:39.421 --> 01:41:41.964]  But yes, we need capital to expand the spot.
[01:41:42.004 --> 01:41:44.166]  We could do so much more if we had the money.
[01:41:44.753 --> 01:41:46.494]  So, support us.
[01:41:46.514 --> 01:42:03.382]  1-888-253-3139 or Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com Order the films via the Safe Secure online shopping cart or watch them all online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv Let's take a few calls.
[01:42:03.922 --> 01:42:07.104]  Chris in Illinois was making some good points earlier, but I had to move on to our guest.
[01:42:07.144 --> 01:42:09.505]  I'll bring him back up, then Adam and others.
[01:42:09.605 --> 01:42:10.765]  Chris, finish up what you were saying.
[01:42:11.286 --> 01:42:11.946]  Well, um...
[01:42:13.749 --> 01:42:23.597]  You had a sign saying, our government is perfecting genocide, which they are, a million and a half Iraqis, and you were marching around in front of the FBI offices.
[01:42:23.638 --> 01:42:27.581]  Yeah, and the police, you know, security first questioned me.
[01:42:27.601 --> 01:42:28.962]  He asked me what group I was with.
[01:42:29.042 --> 01:42:30.163]  I said, I'm not with a group.
[01:42:30.223 --> 01:42:33.246]  I'm an American citizen, and I believe this is happening.
[01:42:33.286 --> 01:42:34.247]  I believe people should know.
[01:42:34.787 --> 01:42:37.529]  And he asked me, why this particular building?
[01:42:37.590 --> 01:42:39.932]  And with, you know, them guys setting up bombs...
[01:42:40.672 --> 01:42:43.654]  Federal buildings, I understand why, you know, they were asking me.
[01:42:44.195 --> 01:43:05.311]  So, but then two local police show up, and they, and I said, are you aware that with all these RFID readers in every single store that, and they're talking about a plan to microchip each and every, you know, living individual on the planet, that all... Police chiefs are trying to make their cops do it.
[01:43:05.351 --> 01:43:06.932]  No, I mean, this is Twilight Zone.
[01:43:07.172 --> 01:43:09.714]  The police, the man, the police...
[01:43:10.848 --> 01:43:18.053]  Because Sean Hannity and every other show, literally, TV and radio, have been promoting taking the chip.
[01:43:30.077 --> 01:43:31.858]  A microchip, the number of the beast.
[01:43:31.878 --> 01:43:32.658]  Yeah, I mean, look at this.
[01:43:32.698 --> 01:43:39.220]  You're on the street with cops talking about taking chips, and this is how weird things have gotten, and he's there saying it's good.
[01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:40.160]  Exactly.
[01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:42.401]  I mean, folks, we're in a Twilight Zone episode.
[01:43:42.821 --> 01:43:45.442]  Yeah, well, that's not even the worst part of it.
[01:43:45.522 --> 01:43:46.463]  This is the worst part.
[01:43:47.743 --> 01:43:52.084]  That is an FBI building, and I live directly across the street from it.
[01:43:52.244 --> 01:43:53.985]  I mean, I can look out my window and see it.
[01:43:54.525 --> 01:43:56.686]  Well, they sent someone out there,
[01:43:57.467 --> 01:44:08.957]  And the guy fully said that his sister got kidnapped two times and if she wouldn't have had that microchip in her, that they never would have found her.
[01:44:09.077 --> 01:44:11.819]  I said, man, you are such a liar.
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:19.966]  Why would you expect me to believe that the thing that I was thinking in my head, that that actually happened to you?
[01:44:20.046 --> 01:44:21.547]  I mean, what are the chances of that?
[01:44:21.827 --> 01:44:24.129]  No, they were sitting there treating you like you were crazy, sir.
[01:44:24.449 --> 01:44:24.970]  Exactly.
[01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:26.131]  Okay, so how did all this end?
[01:44:27.598 --> 01:44:29.219]  They said, go ahead.
[01:44:30.039 --> 01:44:34.881]  And people came up and tried to ask me about why I was doing that.
[01:44:35.082 --> 01:44:35.902]  And I told them.
[01:44:36.062 --> 01:44:38.943]  And 10 out of 10 people agreed with me.
[01:44:40.164 --> 01:44:40.624]  That's right.
[01:44:40.684 --> 01:44:41.444]  Thanks for the call.
[01:44:42.565 --> 01:44:43.465]  That's what I've been getting.
[01:44:43.665 --> 01:44:43.885]  10 out of 10.
[01:44:44.225 --> 01:44:45.606]  You've got to get into the 30s.
[01:44:46.887 --> 01:44:48.147]  30 people to get disagreement.
[01:44:48.167 --> 01:44:50.868]  I mean, this is on other talk shows where the host is attacking me.
[01:44:51.969 --> 01:44:52.869]  This is the numbers now.
[01:44:53.690 --> 01:44:54.610]  On average, I'll sit there.
[01:44:55.367 --> 01:44:59.351]  I'm doing a two-hour interview going, one caller, two caller, three caller, four caller, the fifth caller.
[01:44:59.631 --> 01:45:00.472]  I do a slash through it.
[01:45:00.492 --> 01:45:01.032]  That's five.
[01:45:01.052 --> 01:45:03.054]  I mean, I've actually done this many times.
[01:45:03.594 --> 01:45:06.697]  And right around the 30s, low 30s, on average.
[01:45:06.978 --> 01:45:12.222]  Or, you know, it might be the first caller who calls and disagrees, and then you take another 25, 30, 40, and then no one disagrees.
[01:45:12.923 --> 01:45:16.086]  But generally, I'll challenge.
[01:45:16.146 --> 01:45:17.567]  I'll say, please call and disagree.
[01:45:18.168 --> 01:45:18.928]  They will call.
[01:45:19.649 --> 01:45:20.450]  And it's sick.
[01:45:21.803 --> 01:45:22.984]  Let's talk to Ed in Utah.
[01:45:23.064 --> 01:45:23.664]  Ed, go ahead.
[01:45:24.344 --> 01:45:25.524]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[01:45:25.664 --> 01:45:36.368]  I just want to make a point to some of the... What we have to worry about, in my opinion, is what I've been calling on local radio here, calling in, is the naive Christian conservative.
[01:45:36.988 --> 01:45:40.249]  And the reason I say that, I was once part of that ranks in a way.
[01:45:40.269 --> 01:45:43.230]  You know, I put my luck, or cast my...
[01:45:44.203 --> 01:45:47.705]  I want in with Ronald Reagan and those people back in the 80s.
[01:45:48.265 --> 01:45:52.486]  And then, of course, like you, Alex, and others, I saw better.
[01:45:52.947 --> 01:45:54.427]  And I saw through all that.
[01:45:54.587 --> 01:45:55.988]  And things have changed.
[01:45:56.228 --> 01:46:01.850]  But the naive Christian conservative is a dangerous phenomenon because their numbers are higher.
[01:46:02.250 --> 01:46:06.652]  I've always felt that people of what they like to call conservatives are the greater number in this country.
[01:46:06.972 --> 01:46:13.495]  But they are the ones that are being targeted by Sean Sean the Neocon, Michael the Savage, Rush Limbaugh,
[01:46:13.995 --> 01:46:20.619]  And all these people, William... Well, yeah, the globalists can't win unless they co-opt, and it's a perfect cop-out.
[01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:21.480]  Everything's fine.
[01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:22.621]  You've got conservative leaders.
[01:46:22.981 --> 01:46:23.601]  Go to sleep.
[01:46:23.942 --> 01:46:26.683]  The Republicans have the majority of the state houses.
[01:46:27.104 --> 01:46:30.406]  They have the majority of the Congress, the legislative.
[01:46:30.426 --> 01:46:31.226]  They have the executive.
[01:46:31.246 --> 01:46:32.047]  They have the judicial.
[01:46:32.467 --> 01:46:33.488]  They have the bureaucracy.
[01:46:33.528 --> 01:46:34.468]  And look what's happening.
[01:46:34.769 --> 01:46:35.589]  Hell on earth.
[01:46:35.989 --> 01:46:37.470]  Total destruction of freedom.
[01:46:37.811 --> 01:46:39.672]  Total what they would call liberalism.
[01:46:40.052 --> 01:46:40.272]  Yes.
[01:46:40.733 --> 01:46:51.161]  And now you need to take a bow when you look at the fact that I've tried to tell some of these naive Christian conservatives that there's a male prostitute ring operating in the White House.
[01:46:51.682 --> 01:46:56.546]  And as you might know, there was a meltdown in local media over in Des Moines, Iowa.
[01:46:57.066 --> 01:47:03.695]  Alex, one of the papers there, according to Tom Flacco, was shut down, and that's been confirmed, that they were shut down.
[01:47:03.715 --> 01:47:06.198]  Well, it's been in the news, and they're panicking, and yeah.
[01:47:06.598 --> 01:47:10.443]  Yeah, and so basically... Well, it's not debatable that they got...
[01:47:12.702 --> 01:47:15.005]  Gay homosexual rings?
[01:47:15.085 --> 01:47:15.345]  Right.
[01:47:15.545 --> 01:47:29.982]  But Senator John DeCamp, as you know, author of the Franklin cover-up, and Ted Gunderson are all but convinced that this Johnny Gotch, the paperboy kidnapped 20 years ago in these child theft rings that you talk about, Alex, is one and the same person of Jeff Gannon.
[01:47:30.242 --> 01:47:30.702]  No, I hear you.
[01:47:30.762 --> 01:47:32.743]  I've got to let you go because I've got to keep all these calls.
[01:47:32.783 --> 01:47:38.144]  But I have the drugs report here where Bush goes to a press conference and goes, Are you still having Splash Day?
[01:47:38.184 --> 01:47:41.745]  Which everybody's known for decades is a gay meeting.
[01:47:42.246 --> 01:47:45.947]  And he goes, I'm not saying I go to Splash Day, but how's Splash Day going?
[01:47:46.627 --> 01:47:47.867]  I mean, come on, folks.
[01:47:48.607 --> 01:47:50.488]  It's so ridiculous.
[01:47:50.928 --> 01:47:52.229]  They admit the bohemian growth.
[01:47:52.269 --> 01:47:53.809]  They bust in the male prostitutes.
[01:47:54.829 --> 01:47:56.370]  Let's go to Jimmy in Missouri.
[01:47:56.410 --> 01:47:57.050]  Jimmy, go ahead.
[01:47:57.978 --> 01:47:58.338]  How are you?
[01:47:58.659 --> 01:47:58.879]  Good.
[01:47:59.319 --> 01:47:59.539]  Good.
[01:47:59.619 --> 01:48:00.080]  I'm calling.
[01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:04.583]  This is mainly an extension from yesterday's conversation with Chuck Baldwin.
[01:48:05.224 --> 01:48:11.809]  My wife and I, for the last five Sundays, have been trying to find a good, solid church to attend.
[01:48:12.429 --> 01:48:17.093]  And all we are running into is basically nothing about the Bible.
[01:48:17.193 --> 01:48:18.674]  It's government propaganda.
[01:48:18.794 --> 01:48:20.015]  It's Bush's Uncle Lord.
[01:48:20.075 --> 01:48:21.336]  We've got to do what Bush says.
[01:48:21.376 --> 01:48:22.036]  He will save us.
[01:48:22.357 --> 01:48:22.917]  Exactly.
[01:48:23.177 --> 01:48:24.598]  And by the way, turn your guns in.
[01:48:24.638 --> 01:48:25.199]  It's conservative.
[01:48:25.803 --> 01:48:27.724]  It's unbelievable, Alex.
[01:48:27.844 --> 01:48:31.106]  You know, we're trying to find a good church.
[01:48:31.166 --> 01:48:33.067]  We live in the Kansas City, Missouri area.
[01:48:33.087 --> 01:48:34.368]  Good luck!
[01:48:35.089 --> 01:48:36.389]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:48:37.150 --> 01:48:39.111]  And there just is nothing out there.
[01:48:39.171 --> 01:48:40.512]  I mean, everywhere we go.
[01:48:40.612 --> 01:48:47.556]  I've probably been to 15 churches over the years in Austin, and they're just universally worthless.
[01:48:48.431 --> 01:48:50.632]  And it's just a darn shame, I tell you.
[01:48:50.652 --> 01:49:08.723]  And I thought maybe if some of your listeners in the Kansas City area out there hearing this, if they know of a good church, if they could call in and let me know, because the people we're running across, if you try to explain to them about Mr. Bush's Advanced Directives Act, signed in 1999 in Texas,
[01:49:10.288 --> 01:49:12.409]  And it just, they ignore it.
[01:49:12.429 --> 01:49:15.990]  Which is killing people who could be rehabilitated.
[01:49:16.290 --> 01:49:17.610]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:49:17.750 --> 01:49:22.832]  And, you know, they don't want to hear, they just don't want to hear the truth at all.
[01:49:23.012 --> 01:49:28.794]  And it's very discouraging out here that basically we're just, you know, going in for propaganda.
[01:49:28.834 --> 01:49:34.196]  And we're looking for a good church, so if anybody in the Kansas City area knows one, call and let us all know.
[01:49:34.576 --> 01:49:35.396]  All right, thank you.
[01:49:35.416 --> 01:49:37.517]  Yeah, if you know of a good church in Austin, I'd like to know about it.
[01:49:38.749 --> 01:49:42.412]  I mean, most of the real churches are going on in people's houses.
[01:49:44.313 --> 01:49:45.794]  Just like Christ said in His time.
[01:49:45.994 --> 01:49:47.075]  I mean, it's the same thing.
[01:49:47.735 --> 01:49:48.416]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:48.436 --> 01:49:48.856]  Stay with us.
[01:49:53.863 --> 01:49:58.209]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.389 --> 01:50:02.815]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.956 --> 01:50:07.302]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:07.362 --> 01:50:08.723]  The New World Order.
[01:50:10.511 --> 01:50:14.736]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.796 --> 01:50:21.746]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.846 --> 01:50:23.868]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:24.329 --> 01:50:28.410]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:52:56.072 --> 01:53:01.674]  Audio calls the next hour, but I'm also going to cover California proposes requiring bullet ID numbers.
[01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:03.440]  That's out of Reuters.
[01:53:03.460 --> 01:53:05.141]  That, of course, will force it nationwide.
[01:53:06.601 --> 01:53:08.982]  Across the nation, students getting paid to be informants.
[01:53:09.022 --> 01:53:11.903]  We first covered this in Road to Tyranny three years ago.
[01:53:11.923 --> 01:53:15.784]  But now it is mainstream news everywhere.
[01:53:15.864 --> 01:53:19.045]  Hundreds of dollars, even thousands, to tattle on mommy, daddy.
[01:53:19.725 --> 01:53:21.245]  They give them little tattletale cards.
[01:53:21.265 --> 01:53:22.606]  They make them deputy agents.
[01:53:23.426 --> 01:53:27.747]  This is what you send your child to school to be, a government informant, while the government ships the drugs in.
[01:53:29.905 --> 01:53:39.349]  I've got an article here about them killing children with pesticides and medications that CPS grab, and even the social workers are refusing to go along with it, and if they refuse, they're fired.
[01:53:39.369 --> 01:53:44.452]  I'm not saying all these people are bad, folks, but the system and the directives are pure evil.
[01:53:45.592 --> 01:53:48.674]  And even the CPS workers who are brainwashed go, man, we're killing kids.
[01:53:49.274 --> 01:53:49.894]  What are you doing?
[01:53:50.034 --> 01:53:51.215]  That's it, you're fired!
[01:53:51.555 --> 01:53:52.856]  I mean, this is nightmarish.
[01:53:52.936 --> 01:53:53.796]  This is mainstream news.
[01:53:55.477 --> 01:53:57.718]  There's so much, but it's all coming up.
[01:53:58.277 --> 01:54:00.178]  This is the type of stuff your government's doing, folks.
[01:54:00.198 --> 01:54:05.739]  I mean, they'll take troops and put them in a concrete bunker and put nerve gas in and kill them just to test it.
[01:54:07.059 --> 01:54:08.340]  I mean, that's mainstream news.
[01:54:09.580 --> 01:54:13.241]  They'll spray stuff in a New York subway and kill Americans cold-bloodedly.
[01:54:13.921 --> 01:54:21.103]  They'll give a pregnant wife of a GI uranium pill, sell her their vitamins, and then cover and document how she has a miscarriage.
[01:54:22.123 --> 01:54:24.564]  That's your government, folks, so you better get it straight.
[01:54:25.310 --> 01:54:28.852]  Being patriotic means you defend your country, your Bill of Rights, your Constitution.
[01:54:29.612 --> 01:54:32.714]  It doesn't mean you defend the criminals that run your country.
[01:54:33.314 --> 01:54:38.536]  You know, being a patriot of Germany didn't mean you supported Adolf Hitler, though he told you that's what patriotism was.
[01:54:39.797 --> 01:54:40.697]  Wes in Tennessee.
[01:54:40.717 --> 01:54:41.618]  You're on the air, Wes.
[01:54:41.638 --> 01:54:42.058]  Go ahead.
[01:54:42.078 --> 01:54:44.839]  Good to talk to you, Wes.
[01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:47.821]  I guess Wes is gone.
[01:54:49.622 --> 01:54:51.363]  All right, let's go to Roger in Pennsylvania.
[01:54:51.423 --> 01:54:52.183]  Roger, go ahead.
[01:54:54.208 --> 01:54:54.748]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:54:54.828 --> 01:54:56.469]  A previous call reminded me of this.
[01:54:56.529 --> 01:55:23.298]  I've been wanting to call this in for weeks at various points, and that is perhaps more persuasively than you and some guests have argued, and that is I must pray myself more earnestly that God will grant me, too, that prescient knowledge that definitely inside of the next 20, 30, 100 years will that apocalyptic world government be ushered in
[01:55:24.062 --> 01:55:35.772]  So that I may stop polishing brass on this sinking ship in full confidence that my fellow children's children will not have reason to despise me.
[01:55:38.875 --> 01:55:43.339]  Well, I mean, I'll tell you, folks, when we say think about your children, I mean, look at your children.
[01:55:44.375 --> 01:55:48.016]  Think about, consciously, the world you're giving them.
[01:55:48.477 --> 01:55:49.377]  What is happening?
[01:55:49.437 --> 01:56:01.742]  The taxation, the regulation, the loss of morals, the scientifically crafted evil telling us torture is good, telling us that evil is good, telling us that lies are good.
[01:56:02.142 --> 01:56:03.242]  I mean, just all of it.
[01:56:03.822 --> 01:56:05.323]  We are being dehumanized.
[01:56:06.083 --> 01:56:06.803]  God bless Alex.
[01:56:07.624 --> 01:56:08.504]  Thank you, Roger.
[01:56:10.625 --> 01:56:12.045]  It makes my head spin.
[01:56:12.466 --> 01:56:13.446]  I mean, they admit...
[01:56:14.904 --> 01:56:18.186]  That they take the troops and they test experimental drugs and vaccines on them.
[01:56:18.266 --> 01:56:19.706]  And it kills a lot of them.
[01:56:19.726 --> 01:56:26.229]  They admit they take healthy children for the drug companies and test pesticides.
[01:56:26.490 --> 01:56:41.737]  And in these descriptions, BBC, New York Daily News, and there's more of this coming out now, in these descriptions they just calmly talk about taking a child who's eight years old, they have to drink pesticide every day, and they live in a little medical facility.
[01:56:42.961 --> 01:56:50.647]  And they get sick and start having seizures, and then they put them in a bed, and they keep giving them pesticide, and then they die, and then they give it another cause of death.
[01:56:52.529 --> 01:56:54.570]  Making children drink pesticide?
[01:56:54.791 --> 01:56:56.292]  And no one gets in trouble?
[01:56:56.312 --> 01:56:57.933]  It's just, oh, we have them drink pesticide.
[01:56:58.694 --> 01:56:59.074]  It's good.
[01:56:59.094 --> 01:57:07.821]  Or taking children that don't even have AIDS and giving them experimental drugs that's even illegal to give people unless they give their consent?
[01:57:10.191 --> 01:57:13.253]  And then they give it to children who do have HIV and kill them with that as well.
[01:57:15.815 --> 01:57:16.975]  It's incredible.
[01:57:18.196 --> 01:57:20.898]  But I mean, they did this in the 40s and 50s with eugenics.
[01:57:22.419 --> 01:57:25.981]  You know, in hindsight, 400,000 women were forcibly sterilized.
[01:57:26.021 --> 01:57:27.242]  It was a crime against humanity.
[01:57:27.802 --> 01:57:29.884]  Thousands had biological tested on them.
[01:57:29.924 --> 01:57:30.504]  It was horrible.
[01:57:30.784 --> 01:57:32.325]  They radiated small children.
[01:57:33.106 --> 01:57:36.308]  They radiated retarded children and killed them with radiation and military tests.
[01:57:37.129 --> 01:57:38.170]  We don't do that anymore.
[01:57:38.190 --> 01:57:39.712]  No, you just do it bigger and better.
[01:57:40.133 --> 01:57:40.994]  Third hour coming up.
[01:57:41.614 --> 01:57:42.015]  Big Brother.
[01:57:42.035 --> 01:57:42.636]  Mainstream Media.
[01:57:53.266 --> 01:57:54.366]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.007 --> 01:57:55.867]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.587 --> 01:57:57.468]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.488 --> 01:58:01.789]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.349 --> 01:58:06.471]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:11.572 --> 01:58:12.573]  Alright, my friends.
[01:58:13.253 --> 01:58:19.235]  We're now into hour number three on this Wednesday edition, the 27th day of April 2005.
[01:58:24.019 --> 01:58:30.000]  Coming up, we'll tell you about some of the latest gun control tactics the government's pushing to disarm us so they can fully enslave us.
[01:58:31.460 --> 01:58:34.081]  Across the nation, students are getting paid to be informants.
[01:58:35.861 --> 01:58:39.162]  We've now got more information on these billboards that say the U.S.
[01:58:39.182 --> 01:58:40.022]  is now Mexico.
[01:58:40.042 --> 01:58:42.762]  Third Channel's got them up all over the place.
[01:58:45.043 --> 01:58:50.724]  Also, I have reports here, again, as I was speaking about earlier, of the government trying to
[01:58:52.816 --> 01:59:00.502]  Well, not trying, succeeding in taking children from their parents and testing pesticides, toxic drugs on them.
[01:59:01.483 --> 01:59:08.788]  We're talking Joseph Mingala-style garbage.
[01:59:10.129 --> 01:59:15.053]  But we're all supposed to accept this because this is how we're patriotic.
[01:59:15.794 --> 01:59:18.636]  I'm also going to take a lot of calls quickly in this third hour.
[01:59:18.656 --> 01:59:19.817]  I'm going to go right to your calls.
[01:59:20.404 --> 01:59:23.226]  And then move on to the next person, toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:59:23.246 --> 01:59:23.326]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:59:23.366 --> 01:59:26.389]  Right now, let's go ahead and go to Mark in Texas.
[01:59:26.429 --> 01:59:27.069]  Mark, go ahead.
[01:59:28.350 --> 01:59:32.473]  Well, I think America is definitely, everyone can agree that they're raping the wages for sins.
[01:59:44.654 --> 01:59:49.698]  You know, this fella calls in and he's like, no one can find a righteous assembly of people.
[01:59:49.758 --> 01:59:59.186]  Well, you know, when Christians wake up and throw out the Ishtar bun in the Satan claws of this mythological pagan religious system, then maybe, oh, we can heal this land.
[01:59:59.406 --> 01:59:59.927]  What do you think?
[02:00:01.448 --> 02:00:04.510]  Well, I mean, the New World Order is hidden in plain view.
[02:00:05.111 --> 02:00:06.432]  And the churches don't want to hear it.
[02:00:06.612 --> 02:00:11.276]  The steeples, the bunnies, the Santa Claus, all of it.
[02:00:11.296 --> 02:00:12.337]  I mean, these aren't the dates.
[02:00:13.527 --> 02:00:15.448]  Of Christ's birth and death and resurrection.
[02:00:15.488 --> 02:00:20.510]  These aren't... I mean, Ishtar, why do you think Playboy symbol is a rabbit?
[02:00:20.950 --> 02:00:23.211]  It is fertility, Ishtar, the eggs.
[02:00:23.591 --> 02:00:31.135]  Ancient Israel in the past, when they would transgress his covenant, they would be allowed to go into slavery.
[02:00:32.615 --> 02:00:35.456]  Did an angel come and roll away the stone, or did an Easter Bunny?
[02:00:37.907 --> 02:00:50.774]  Well, there's a great website that shows some of the things that are coming to pass as far as prophecy, and it's www.remnantofyhwh.com, and that's a group there that stands for the true religion of the Messiah and the Apostles.
[02:00:50.955 --> 02:00:52.976]  Well, you know, what's interesting that you raise is this.
[02:00:53.656 --> 02:00:56.097]  Our government says, and our media says, support Israel.
[02:00:56.678 --> 02:00:57.418]  It's in the Bible.
[02:00:57.478 --> 02:00:59.339]  Whatever they do, they can do no wrong.
[02:00:59.359 --> 02:01:00.280]  You've got to support Israel.
[02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:02.121]  Well, wait a minute.
[02:01:02.873 --> 02:01:10.518]  The whole Bible, New and Old Testament, is God judging Israel for being bad, and Christ came and criticized the government.
[02:01:11.219 --> 02:01:12.960]  It didn't mean he was anti-Semitic.
[02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:14.921]  Contrary, it was the opposite.
[02:01:15.461 --> 02:01:16.782]  So how do they twist that?
[02:01:16.902 --> 02:01:23.306]  I mean, the Bible says the Antichrist is going to say he's the Messiah and have his image in Jerusalem.
[02:01:23.326 --> 02:01:27.049]  So are we going to have to bow down and support Israel when the Antichrist is there?
[02:01:29.631 --> 02:01:30.571]  Correct me if I'm wrong.
[02:01:30.591 --> 02:01:31.572]  Doesn't the Bible say that?
[02:01:32.375 --> 02:01:34.177]  Well, of course it does.
[02:01:34.417 --> 02:01:42.665]  But I've got to worship whoever's there, though, so then I better... Well, we've been, you know, according to Jeremiah 16, 19, it says we've inherited lies.
[02:01:42.785 --> 02:01:48.110]  And that's what Christians need to wake up to the fact that, you know, Ishtar bunnies and Santa Claus, these are lies.
[02:01:48.130 --> 02:01:50.612]  This is a psychos... What is the word?
[02:01:50.652 --> 02:01:50.913]  They're...
[02:01:58.578 --> 02:02:02.540]  Psychosis, where you believe that fantasy is reality.
[02:02:02.560 --> 02:02:04.601]  Well, I mean, take Halloween.
[02:02:04.641 --> 02:02:16.308]  It just so happens to be the high holy day of the Druids for human sacrifice, Encyclopedia Britannica, and they go, oh, there's no coincidence that we dress up like demons on this day, and that this didn't get popular until the 1950s.
[02:02:16.348 --> 02:02:26.694]  Well, it would be, you know, I know you can't, you know, this isn't the religious program, but it would be a benefit to the nation if you would call the people to repent and return to the true faith.
[02:02:27.930 --> 02:02:31.014]  Well, I mean, I don't hide that under a bushel.
[02:02:31.055 --> 02:02:34.159]  I mean, I'm an open book here.
[02:02:34.920 --> 02:02:40.427]  I just cover the news and information, and the news and information shows we've got a bunch of Satanists running this planet.
[02:02:40.447 --> 02:02:41.048]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:45.609 --> 02:02:52.434]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:02:52.775 --> 02:02:54.136]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:02:54.336 --> 02:02:56.558]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:02:56.678 --> 02:02:58.779]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.

[02:03:09.607 --> 02:03:09.807]  I think?

[02:03:47.819 --> 02:03:50.620]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?

[02:06:05.449 --> 02:06:07.890]  I'll take two or three calls and cover a couple news stories.
[02:06:07.910 --> 02:06:10.491]  Take two or three calls, cover a couple news stories.
[02:06:11.511 --> 02:06:13.993]  Intersperse that leapfrogging back and forth.

[02:06:16.994 --> 02:06:17.074]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:17.094 --> 02:06:21.756]  Any news item, any issue, any news story, any question, any comment, you've got...
[02:06:29.214 --> 02:06:40.721]  Don in Missouri, and he told us he's calling in to answer a caller's question earlier, who's in Kansas City, saying he'd been to all these churches, and they're all basically pro-New World Order, worship George Bush.
[02:06:43.182 --> 02:06:49.145]  And this caller's saying he's got some good churches, so we're playing matchmaker now, but that's okay.
[02:06:49.205 --> 02:06:49.926]  Don, go ahead.
[02:06:50.526 --> 02:06:51.186]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:06:51.667 --> 02:06:51.827]  Good.
[02:06:52.882 --> 02:06:53.743]  Actually, I'm not playing.
[02:06:53.983 --> 02:06:58.427]  I don't have a church for him, but I'm thinking... Okay, I thought that's what you told the people answering the phone.
[02:06:58.487 --> 02:06:58.667]  Go ahead.
[02:06:58.687 --> 02:07:03.912]  Well, actually, what I was thinking was starting a church, perhaps, if he wants to call me or anybody else in the area.
[02:07:03.932 --> 02:07:04.513]  I can't do that.
[02:07:04.573 --> 02:07:05.934]  I can't start giving phone numbers out.
[02:07:06.294 --> 02:07:06.614]  Okay.
[02:07:06.935 --> 02:07:08.136]  And because, I mean, you used to.
[02:07:08.196 --> 02:07:09.637]  Like, seven years ago, I'd do that.
[02:07:09.677 --> 02:07:12.039]  People started calling, going, I got a tractor for sale.
[02:07:12.340 --> 02:07:12.860]  Yeah, right.
[02:07:13.180 --> 02:07:16.003]  So... Well, anyway, I thought I'd respond to this call, so...
[02:07:16.724 --> 02:07:19.446]  Well, no, I mean, good people need to get together and start churches.
[02:07:19.767 --> 02:07:27.473]  And that's what always happens to the church when it gets corrupt, is that it breaks apart and people go off.
[02:07:28.638 --> 02:07:30.340]  Pretty crazy time of living, that's for sure.
[02:07:53.574 --> 02:07:55.155]  I'll be sending a donation to you tonight.
[02:07:55.175 --> 02:07:56.295]  You're doing a great job, brother.
[02:07:56.555 --> 02:07:57.596]  Well, I appreciate that.
[02:07:58.616 --> 02:07:59.076]  God bless you.
[02:07:59.096 --> 02:08:00.576]  I'd rather you just buy a couple of videos.
[02:08:00.596 --> 02:08:01.417]  That's your donation.
[02:08:01.917 --> 02:08:02.977]  And then give those to people.
[02:08:03.017 --> 02:08:04.198]  But thank you so much, Don.
[02:08:05.478 --> 02:08:06.438]  Yeah, I mean, see?
[02:08:06.478 --> 02:08:09.159]  People can't come up with a good church in these days.
[02:08:10.039 --> 02:08:10.980]  Tim in Ohio.
[02:08:11.060 --> 02:08:11.860]  Tim, go ahead.
[02:08:12.040 --> 02:08:12.800]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:08:13.020 --> 02:08:13.360]  Hello.
[02:08:14.381 --> 02:08:19.122]  I noticed a couple of things driving back and forth to work in the past couple of weeks, and I wanted to talk to you about it.
[02:08:19.622 --> 02:08:21.623]  There were police vehicles...
[02:08:22.136 --> 02:08:27.899]  Pickup trucks with the name of the city on it and the bubblegum red and blue tops.
[02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:30.961]  Yet the license plates were not state issued.
[02:08:31.441 --> 02:08:35.784]  They were black plates with yellow letters and numbers stamped on them.
[02:08:35.904 --> 02:08:37.625]  And what was stamped on this one was 47-MP-3.
[02:08:42.082 --> 02:08:45.343]  And I'm just wondering if that MP might stand for military police?
[02:08:45.743 --> 02:08:46.143]  What do you think?
[02:08:46.483 --> 02:08:55.946]  Well, I mean, they admittedly have military police units involved with local police all over the country, quoted Homeland Security, and it's for the American people.
[02:08:56.767 --> 02:08:59.628]  And they have them involved in drug interdictions, surveillance, you name it.
[02:08:59.648 --> 02:09:00.988]  It has nothing to do with terrorism.
[02:09:01.328 --> 02:09:04.149]  I'm going to call them up and ask them what it means, see if I'll get back to you with the answer.
[02:09:04.429 --> 02:09:05.009]  Good idea.
[02:09:05.029 --> 02:09:05.629]  Okay, thanks, Alex.
[02:09:05.869 --> 02:09:06.630]  Thank you for the call.
[02:09:06.650 --> 02:09:08.930]  More of your calls coming up here in a few minutes.
[02:09:09.751 --> 02:09:10.511]  But first off...
[02:09:11.189 --> 02:09:15.451]  I mean, I spent hours on this, but it's being raised again in the press.
[02:09:16.651 --> 02:09:18.752]  It's been covered by the New York Post.
[02:09:18.812 --> 02:09:20.533]  It's been covered by the New York Daily News.
[02:09:20.593 --> 02:09:21.633]  It's been in the BBC.
[02:09:22.674 --> 02:09:33.798]  The city had allowed babies in foster care who were not previously ill to be used in medical testing of AIDS drugs were first reported again in 2004 by the New York Post.
[02:09:33.938 --> 02:09:38.660]  And now it's come out that they are testing pesticides on them.
[02:09:39.681 --> 02:09:39.821]  And...
[02:09:41.070 --> 02:09:46.214]  It goes into the different reports I have here in front of me today, and this is now admitted.
[02:09:46.234 --> 02:09:48.196]  They've done the investigation, but nobody's getting in trouble.
[02:09:48.896 --> 02:09:55.802]  That they will come, and even before this was in the New York Post, I think it was about five years ago, I interviewed some of the lawyers and families involved.
[02:09:56.362 --> 02:10:05.630]  They'll come predominantly to a poor black family or Hispanic family, and this is the same government that supports Lowry Conquista, by the way, I'd add.
[02:10:05.710 --> 02:10:07.091]  So when you're for that, you're for this.
[02:10:07.111 --> 02:10:08.472]  It's very sick.
[02:10:11.030 --> 02:10:16.336]  They would come to them and say, well, your 8-year-old's gotten in trouble at school.
[02:10:16.697 --> 02:10:17.537]  This was in the news.
[02:10:18.779 --> 02:10:24.265]  And so we're taking your 8-year-old and sign over rights to your 8-year-old or we're going to take your 2-year-old.
[02:10:25.286 --> 02:10:27.349]  And the mother would sign over the 8-year-old.
[02:10:28.089 --> 02:10:29.331]  They would then take the 8-year-old.
[02:10:30.618 --> 02:10:33.840]  And they would test pesticides, AIDS drugs on them, you name it.
[02:10:34.180 --> 02:10:38.703]  Children that didn't even have AIDS or HIV, children that weren't sick.
[02:10:38.723 --> 02:10:47.948]  I mean, it was hundreds of drugs, but the worst stuff was these AIDS drugs, which themselves are very toxic, new experimental ones.
[02:10:48.028 --> 02:10:49.209]  And children died.
[02:10:50.049 --> 02:10:51.450]  It's been in the New York News.
[02:10:51.510 --> 02:10:56.953]  But a story here, a story there, no one ever even gets into trouble.
[02:10:58.590 --> 02:11:10.637]  And the review by New York City itself of the CPS agency staff had determined that about 465 children had been taken part in the trials between 1988 and 2001.
[02:11:11.078 --> 02:11:17.461]  And it just gets into all the things they did to them.
[02:11:19.062 --> 02:11:20.904]  And it talks about foster parents.
[02:11:21.664 --> 02:11:24.746]  If they refused to give the children over and sign the forms...
[02:11:25.872 --> 02:11:36.154]  To let the government and the private groups test on the children a myriad of toxins they would have the children taken and given to other foster parents who just wanted to warehouse them and get the money.
[02:11:36.834 --> 02:11:38.734]  And the same thing happened to CPS workers.
[02:11:38.794 --> 02:11:43.055]  If they refused to go along or filed reports about it saying it was wrong they would be fired.
[02:11:45.215 --> 02:11:47.496]  Well, I mean, it's still your responsibility to stand up against it.
[02:11:47.536 --> 02:11:49.436]  This is torture and murder.
[02:11:50.796 --> 02:11:54.317]  And we have an article on presentplanet.com
[02:11:55.720 --> 02:12:00.465]  That's kind of a synopsis of all these other mainstream news articles that you can go read about.
[02:12:01.246 --> 02:12:02.667]  And here it is in plain view.
[02:12:04.149 --> 02:12:10.776]  We don't have to wait 30 years to hear about them giving the uranium pills to pregnant wives of GIs to see what would happen.
[02:12:11.403 --> 02:12:24.950]  You don't have to wait 20 years to find out about how military families would have retarded children and the military would say, oh, we've got a treatment for them and put them in a radiator and they would die two days later just to test radiation on them.
[02:12:25.410 --> 02:12:26.491]  That's been mainstream news.
[02:12:26.511 --> 02:12:31.333]  You can just type in retarded children radiated or children who had cancer.
[02:12:32.097 --> 02:12:35.560]  They would then tell them it was a radiation treatment.
[02:12:35.580 --> 02:12:36.601]  They would just kill the child.
[02:12:37.142 --> 02:12:38.783]  And see, that was 30, 40 years ago.
[02:12:38.823 --> 02:12:39.363]  That was the excuse.
[02:12:39.383 --> 02:12:46.169]  They said, well, this child will probably already die of cancer, so we're just going to kill him with radiation to test how much radiation a human body can take.
[02:12:48.491 --> 02:12:50.273]  And see, that's the excuse for the researchers.
[02:12:50.593 --> 02:12:55.437]  The weird moral gymnastics they engage in.
[02:12:55.917 --> 02:12:56.258]  Now in 2005...
[02:12:58.629 --> 02:13:00.793]  We just give them pesticides until they die.
[02:13:01.013 --> 02:13:01.835]  Healthy children.
[02:13:03.358 --> 02:13:04.059]  Healthy children.
[02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:06.985]  And again, predominantly, it's black children.
[02:13:08.047 --> 02:13:09.169]  Some of them are Hispanic.
[02:13:10.586 --> 02:13:15.967]  They've broken the black family down so badly that it's pretty easy to target blacks in this country.
[02:13:16.487 --> 02:13:22.989]  Hispanics are family-oriented, but generally so poor in New York, and this is happening in other areas, that they can't fight back.
[02:13:23.009 --> 02:13:24.109]  But they like to target blacks.
[02:13:24.129 --> 02:13:26.269]  They seem to be the easiest to get and target.
[02:13:26.289 --> 02:13:27.930]  They've had a lot of practice at that.
[02:13:28.430 --> 02:13:29.670]  And it does happen to some whites.
[02:13:30.050 --> 02:13:33.671]  We haven't found it happening to Asians, because Asians have such strong families.
[02:13:34.426 --> 02:13:35.126]  They won't put up with it.
[02:13:35.146 --> 02:13:38.408]  They'll just leave the country or go to another area of the nation.
[02:13:38.428 --> 02:13:45.452]  They'll move instantly because family is so important to them and the globalists haven't had time to crack open their family structure yet.
[02:13:46.953 --> 02:13:48.734]  But under new freedom, it's going to be a lot worse.
[02:13:48.814 --> 02:13:53.737]  Every child forcibly tested by these people into their clutches, into their system.
[02:13:54.817 --> 02:13:58.199]  Again, I could talk all day about this article, but that's the basics there.
[02:13:59.986 --> 02:14:04.369]  California proposes requiring bullet ID numbers on every bullet.
[02:14:05.030 --> 02:14:10.493]  Of course, this will add, just conservatively, will double the price of ammunition.
[02:14:11.214 --> 02:14:17.818]  And California, obviously the most populous state, one of the biggest buyers, the citizens of ammunition.
[02:14:18.799 --> 02:14:21.581]  And so this will force manufacturers across the board to do it.
[02:14:21.941 --> 02:14:28.406]  California's Attorney General introduced pioneering legislation on Tuesday that would require all bullets sold in the nation's most populous states
[02:14:29.735 --> 02:14:32.477]  Most popular state to bear tiny identification numbers.
[02:14:34.519 --> 02:14:37.421]  And, of course, then that creates a registry.
[02:14:37.721 --> 02:14:40.043]  The bill would also create a registry when you buy ammo.
[02:14:40.483 --> 02:14:40.683]  L.A.
[02:14:40.723 --> 02:14:45.847]  already registers you with your ID when you buy ammo, and they've banned everything above .40 caliber.
[02:14:46.668 --> 02:14:47.848]  That's what Clinton wanted to do.
[02:14:47.888 --> 02:14:54.553]  This was the same plan back in 1994 that caused a huge rebellion and had Republicans sweep the House.
[02:14:55.194 --> 02:14:58.336]  They're now still in office doing the same thing, betraying us.
[02:14:58.928 --> 02:15:06.711]  The bill aimed at helping investigators solve crime but require ammunition vendors to submit sales records to state registry starting in 07.
[02:15:07.311 --> 02:15:14.894]  Anyone bringing bullets into the state not bearing the tiny serial numbers etched by laser could be punished with up to a year in prison.
[02:15:15.234 --> 02:15:17.695]  So see, you got all that old ammo, that's going to be illegal.
[02:15:18.515 --> 02:15:21.437]  They're going to have to have raids of homes looking for the ammo.
[02:15:21.717 --> 02:15:22.357]  This was the plan.
[02:15:23.137 --> 02:15:27.619]  We're losing too many of our young people to seemingly random shootings and anonymous killers.
[02:15:28.331 --> 02:15:38.878]  California Attorney General Bill Lockyer said in the statement, the bill will strip criminals of their anonymity and give law enforcement evidence it can use to quickly, effectively solve more gun crimes.
[02:15:40.258 --> 02:15:44.841]  So then you'll have home invasions, they'll steal your ammo, they'll kill somebody with it, and they'll come swatting you.
[02:15:46.022 --> 02:15:52.006]  And they've broken down the families nicely in California, and so it is bedlam out there in many respects, and so...
[02:15:53.027 --> 02:15:54.228]  This is their pretext.
[02:15:54.748 --> 02:16:04.932]  Legislation which could become the first of its kind nationwide calls for California to assess fees not to extend one half of one cent per bullet to fund the program.
[02:16:05.433 --> 02:16:06.513]  Controversial proposal.
[02:16:06.893 --> 02:16:08.654]  Now, again, that just funds the database.
[02:16:09.414 --> 02:16:14.277]  The bullet makers have to, the ammo makers have to put the marks on it.
[02:16:14.877 --> 02:16:18.018]  Controversial proposal could spark another major gun control debate in California.
[02:16:18.038 --> 02:16:21.680]  And of course, Lord Schwarzenegger supports it because he's conservative.
[02:16:22.761 --> 02:16:26.324]  Alderman in favor for more gun buyer checks.
[02:16:26.824 --> 02:16:29.386]  Plan extends reviews to person-to-person sales.
[02:16:31.008 --> 02:16:38.413]  This is out of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, where, again, if you even give your grandson a gun, it's got to be reported and recorded.
[02:16:40.174 --> 02:16:40.795]  Here's another one.
[02:16:40.815 --> 02:16:43.817]  Across the nation, students getting paid to be informants.
[02:16:44.298 --> 02:16:46.139]  KCRA-TV.
[02:16:47.220 --> 02:16:50.062]  I'm seeing one of these stories every day now, literally.
[02:16:50.899 --> 02:16:57.902]  You can see one of the newscasts, one of the news pieces here in Austin, where they say, you know, turn your neighbors in, turn everybody in, here's your tattletale card.
[02:16:58.442 --> 02:16:59.402]  It's your duty to do it.
[02:16:59.442 --> 02:17:01.103]  You get $200 every time you do it.
[02:17:02.384 --> 02:17:03.844]  But it's happening nationwide now.
[02:17:04.284 --> 02:17:12.308]  For a growing number of students, the easiest way to make a couple of hundred dollars has nothing to do with chores and after school jobs, everything to do with informing on classmates.
[02:17:13.588 --> 02:17:18.190]  And they go on to say, because of the Red Lake, Minnesota situation, we've got to all do this.
[02:17:19.321 --> 02:17:22.483]  For kids of that age, it's hard for them to tell on their peers.
[02:17:23.964 --> 02:17:27.165]  Again, it includes tattling on parents, what's in the medicine cabinet.
[02:17:27.606 --> 02:17:30.107]  If somebody's skipping school, you get $100 for that.
[02:17:30.127 --> 02:17:36.290]  $500 for reporting information about plans to commit crime or about guns.
[02:17:37.971 --> 02:17:40.993]  Our children should be taught to report guns at school regardless.
[02:17:42.074 --> 02:17:42.774]  Not because they get $500.
[02:17:42.814 --> 02:17:43.534]  This is Nazi Germany.
[02:17:47.506 --> 02:17:49.847]  Hi folks, Jack Browning from Midas Resources.
[02:17:49.867 --> 02:17:51.168]  The real money folks.
[02:17:54.469 --> 02:17:56.390]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[02:17:56.890 --> 02:17:57.870]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[02:17:57.950 --> 02:17:59.331]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[02:17:59.371 --> 02:17:59.791]  A 5% increase.
[02:18:00.391 --> 02:18:02.792]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[02:18:02.812 --> 02:18:06.013]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[02:18:15.706 --> 02:18:21.351]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s, a 16% increase in real money.
[02:18:21.951 --> 02:18:24.994]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[02:18:25.554 --> 02:18:30.699]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.

[02:18:47.823 --> 02:18:53.565]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:18:53.826 --> 02:18:58.968]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:18:59.288 --> 02:19:08.572]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[02:19:08.932 --> 02:19:13.874]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[02:19:14.195 --> 02:19:18.197]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[02:19:18.417 --> 02:19:23.179]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[02:19:23.559 --> 02:19:29.462]  The Mercury Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[02:19:45.996 --> 02:19:47.117]  Why do you wear watches?
[02:19:47.417 --> 02:19:49.998]  The answer is no longer simply to tell time.
[02:19:50.459 --> 02:19:58.043]  At discountwatchstore.com, watches are as much about telling time as they are about making a fashion statement or showing off one's success.
[02:19:58.404 --> 02:20:02.106]  Watches also make for great heirlooms to pass on for generations to come.
[02:20:02.546 --> 02:20:09.211]  With Mother's Day and Father's Day right around the corner, now is a perfect time to get them the watch they've always wanted.

[02:20:45.640 --> 02:20:49.001]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[02:20:49.241 --> 02:20:49.581]  Why?
[02:20:49.601 --> 02:20:52.541]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[02:20:52.621 --> 02:20:57.562]  Cardivite drops in capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.

[02:21:56.005 --> 02:21:57.326]  And then back to your calls.
[02:21:58.727 --> 02:21:59.527]  Let's go quickly.
[02:22:00.027 --> 02:22:01.668]  Patrick in Kentucky.
[02:22:01.688 --> 02:22:02.349]  You're on the air.
[02:22:02.389 --> 02:22:02.729]  Welcome.
[02:22:03.109 --> 02:22:03.329]  Hi, Alex.
[02:22:03.369 --> 02:22:04.149]  How are you doing?
[02:22:04.289 --> 02:22:04.630]  Good, sir.
[02:22:05.170 --> 02:22:08.312]  Yeah, I'm calling to inform people.
[02:22:08.352 --> 02:22:09.852]  I'm sure they're aware of this already.
[02:22:09.872 --> 02:22:12.574]  If you like to buy...
[02:22:13.661 --> 02:22:14.242]  I think so.
[02:22:34.147 --> 02:22:36.408]  I mean, my throat's like been burning and everything.
[02:22:36.848 --> 02:22:39.889]  I mean, I thought it was the chemicals naturally coming from the leaves.
[02:22:40.570 --> 02:22:43.051]  No, I have read the articles.
[02:22:43.071 --> 02:22:48.293]  A lot of these so-called organic vegetables are not organic.
[02:22:48.934 --> 02:22:51.635]  And then you've always got to wash your greens.
[02:22:51.675 --> 02:22:57.579]  I mean, do you buy the stuff that's citrus-based that you spray down the vegetables with and soak in water?
[02:22:57.799 --> 02:23:00.440]  It says washed and ready to use.
[02:23:00.560 --> 02:23:01.400]  Never believe that.
[02:23:01.901 --> 02:23:02.181]  Okay.
[02:23:02.201 --> 02:23:06.103]  You know, in Mexico, what their main fertilizer is is human feces.
[02:23:07.037 --> 02:23:17.526]  There was a big scare in 96 for the school lunch program where they bought the raspberries and strawberries, tons of them, covered with hepatitis C from human excrement.
[02:23:18.587 --> 02:23:26.734]  And no, sir, what you've got to do is you want to buy from farms locally, and they'll normally have some of your better stores, even if you have to pay triple.
[02:23:27.398 --> 02:23:29.080]  And then you want to soak them.
[02:23:29.900 --> 02:23:37.967]  You want to soak them in a big bowl, and there is a product, or several products, but it's all the same stuff, citrus-based.
[02:23:38.368 --> 02:23:40.590]  It's nothing but orange or lemon extract.
[02:23:40.990 --> 02:23:51.319]  And you spray it down and soak it in water, because it takes that even to get through the wax barrier that is on most plants, and then to extract...
[02:23:52.452 --> 02:23:59.457]  Just the normal stuff like bug excrement and even the natural fertilizers and things that you don't want to be eating.
[02:23:59.977 --> 02:24:01.858]  It's so hard to find local growers over here.
[02:24:01.918 --> 02:24:04.800]  I mean, all we have is Kroger's and a health food store here.
[02:24:06.032 --> 02:24:09.675]  I mean, I bet money you've got farmer's markets every weekend.
[02:24:09.775 --> 02:24:10.896]  Yeah, we've got farmer's markets.
[02:24:10.936 --> 02:24:11.917]  Hit them and hit them hard.
[02:24:11.957 --> 02:24:13.938]  The food will taste 100% better and be cheaper.
[02:24:14.299 --> 02:24:14.919]  Thanks for the call.
[02:24:14.959 --> 02:24:15.600]  Good to hear from you.
[02:24:15.700 --> 02:24:16.060]  Okay, thanks.
[02:24:16.260 --> 02:24:17.561]  Patrick, great question.
[02:24:17.601 --> 02:24:19.743]  I'm sorry I'm moving past you.
[02:24:20.143 --> 02:24:21.604]  I've got to get all these callers in.
[02:24:21.944 --> 02:24:22.925]  Rick in Pennsylvania.
[02:24:23.025 --> 02:24:23.646]  Rick, go ahead.
[02:24:23.766 --> 02:24:24.866]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[02:24:25.047 --> 02:24:25.867]  Four quick things.
[02:24:26.628 --> 02:24:30.351]  Your prison plant at the Market of Bees site on there with a microchip RFID.
[02:24:30.451 --> 02:24:31.852]  It's one of the best I've seen.
[02:24:31.872 --> 02:24:32.192]  Yeah.
[02:24:32.967 --> 02:24:37.089]  I heard you said you were going to do a movie on it, and I think that would be a number one bestseller.
[02:24:37.590 --> 02:24:42.472]  And I'd like to see you do a follow-up, like the 9-11 Descent of Materia in a book form, you know, to accompany that.
[02:24:43.033 --> 02:24:49.336]  Believe me, if our planet starts a larger orbit and it becomes a 48-hour day, I'll work twice as hard.
[02:24:50.957 --> 02:24:56.460]  The second thing, you know, I've gotten to have it every time I mention the New World Order, we call it the Satanic New World Order.
[02:24:57.160 --> 02:25:02.383]  Putting that pronoun in front of it really describes what it is, and it perks the Christian's ears up.
[02:25:03.435 --> 02:25:06.818]  A question I have for you, too, with a follow-up after this.
[02:25:06.838 --> 02:25:13.083]  There's such a song I wrote called Mommy, Mommy, pro-life, anti-abort song.
[02:25:13.103 --> 02:25:14.784]  I want to know if you ever heard it.
[02:25:15.084 --> 02:25:16.625]  I did get it, and I appreciate it.
[02:25:16.665 --> 02:25:23.290]  I get a lot of great music and material, and someday, if I have enough time and energy, I'll give it to the network and have them put it on air.
[02:25:23.490 --> 02:25:23.711]  Great.
[02:25:23.811 --> 02:25:24.391]  Last thing.
[02:25:25.012 --> 02:25:28.074]  You played that song, When the Levee Breaks.
[02:25:28.846 --> 02:25:32.848]  I think, you know, back 30 years ago, I think that's Led Zeppelin.
[02:25:32.928 --> 02:25:33.469]  Yes, it is.
[02:25:33.789 --> 02:25:36.651]  And I don't know if you know, but Jimmy Page, you know, him and his gang.
[02:25:36.671 --> 02:25:38.372]  He lived in Alistair Crowley's castle.
[02:25:38.412 --> 02:25:40.553]  Yeah, a bunch of devil worshippers.
[02:25:41.073 --> 02:25:42.014]  So that's all I have to say.
[02:25:42.054 --> 02:25:43.174]  Thanks a lot for being here, Alex.
[02:25:43.394 --> 02:25:44.395]  I appreciate the call.
[02:25:44.435 --> 02:25:45.556]  No, I'm fully aware of that.
[02:25:46.296 --> 02:25:49.098]  But I don't, I mean, you hear that as elevator music now.
[02:25:49.138 --> 02:25:53.240]  We don't have any of the lyrics from the song.
[02:25:53.320 --> 02:25:55.802]  It's just the beat when the levee breaks.
[02:25:56.442 --> 02:25:57.983]  In fact, can you find that music?
[02:25:59.113 --> 02:26:00.554]  It's just a nice beat.
[02:26:00.614 --> 02:26:01.494]  It's good bumper music.
[02:26:02.394 --> 02:26:08.156]  But, yes, I am aware of that tie-in with Led Zeppelin.
[02:26:09.116 --> 02:26:14.678]  But Jimmy Page, I think he said, I am intrigued with magic.
[02:26:14.698 --> 02:26:19.379]  And then later in his life he said it was real dangerous and that he didn't like it and got away from it.
[02:26:19.419 --> 02:26:21.339]  But he did buy Aleister Crowley's Castle.
[02:26:22.040 --> 02:26:22.820]  That's true.
[02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:25.481]  Let's talk to Ramone in Texas.
[02:26:25.581 --> 02:26:26.501]  Ramone, go ahead.
[02:26:27.253 --> 02:26:27.713]  Hi, Alex.
[02:26:28.033 --> 02:26:29.994]  Hey, I don't know.
[02:26:30.054 --> 02:26:31.154]  I've never heard you mention it.
[02:26:31.554 --> 02:26:32.874]  Are you aware of the Baha'i Faith?
[02:26:33.174 --> 02:26:34.235]  E-A-H-A-I?
[02:26:34.695 --> 02:26:37.815]  Yeah, it's a U.N.-sponsored New Age operation.
[02:26:38.655 --> 02:26:39.076]  Negative.
[02:26:39.296 --> 02:26:39.696]  Negative.
[02:26:39.756 --> 02:26:43.436]  You need to look into it a little bit closer.
[02:26:44.357 --> 02:26:44.817]  Negative?
[02:26:45.197 --> 02:26:45.757]  Negative, huh?
[02:26:45.777 --> 02:26:46.757]  They're not pro-U.N.?
[02:26:47.437 --> 02:26:49.038]  Well, no, I didn't say that.
[02:26:49.058 --> 02:26:49.358]  The U.N.
[02:26:49.398 --> 02:26:50.318]  doesn't sponsor them?
[02:26:50.899 --> 02:26:51.640]  Absolutely not.
[02:26:51.760 --> 02:26:52.540]  As an NGO.
[02:26:52.680 --> 02:26:52.981]  Okay.
[02:26:53.101 --> 02:26:53.901]  Absolutely not.
[02:26:54.021 --> 02:26:56.303]  I guess the Baha'i TV show... Let me finish.
[02:26:56.403 --> 02:26:56.903]  Wait a second.
[02:26:57.123 --> 02:27:01.366]  I guess the Baha'i TV show I've seen about ten times on TV is lying then.
[02:27:01.386 --> 02:27:01.707]  Go ahead.
[02:27:02.127 --> 02:27:02.567]  No, no, no.
[02:27:02.787 --> 02:27:04.508]  No, that's not what I'm saying.
[02:27:04.949 --> 02:27:07.991]  They are a member, an NGO.
[02:27:08.641 --> 02:27:10.443]  But they are not sponsored.
[02:27:10.503 --> 02:27:14.486]  They are not funded through anybody outside of the Baha'i faith.
[02:27:14.586 --> 02:27:15.007]  Stay there.
[02:27:15.067 --> 02:27:16.648]  We can argue about this on the other side.
[02:27:16.728 --> 02:27:18.610]  I just don't want to get into a bash fest.
[02:27:18.630 --> 02:27:21.092]  That's all people do is I have to counter it.
[02:27:21.673 --> 02:27:24.135]  If you ask me about Baha'i, I'm going to tell you what I think about them.
[02:27:25.096 --> 02:27:26.157]  I'll tell you what I think about them.
[02:27:26.177 --> 02:27:27.258]  We have Baha'i listeners.
[02:27:27.938 --> 02:27:29.840]  But I'm sorry I've read their founding documents.
[02:27:29.880 --> 02:27:30.701]  I know what they're about.
[02:27:31.461 --> 02:27:32.022]  But stay there.
[02:27:32.062 --> 02:27:33.083]  We'll talk about it on the other side.
[02:27:36.204 --> 02:27:37.105]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.606 --> 02:27:39.207]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.128 --> 02:27:42.791]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.777 --> 02:27:51.902]  Do you have $10,000, $20,000, $30,000 or more in credit card debt that's suffocating your bank account and your lifestyle?
[02:27:52.042 --> 02:27:56.966]  If you think bankruptcy is the only way out, then pay close attention because relief is on the way.
[02:27:57.167 --> 02:28:06.935]  Debt Relief USA at 800-509-3201 will negotiate with your creditors and settle your credit card debt for about half of what you now owe without filing bankruptcy.
[02:28:07.095 --> 02:28:11.519]  Debt Relief USA has been helping people just like you regain control of their financial future.
[02:28:11.659 --> 02:28:13.000]  In most cases, you can be debt free.
[02:28:13.961 --> 02:28:18.665]  I owed so much on my credit cards, I could barely make the minimum monthly payment.
[02:28:18.805 --> 02:28:21.768]  We talked about filing bankruptcy, but I was concerned about my credit.
[02:28:21.949 --> 02:28:23.930]  That's when I called Debt Relief USA.
[02:28:24.151 --> 02:28:27.814]  They set up a plan for me where I could settle for just 40% of what I owed.
[02:28:28.054 --> 02:28:31.638]  I'm back in control of my life, and I owe it all to Debt Relief USA.
[02:28:31.798 --> 02:28:36.220]  Call Debt Relief USA today for your free consultation.
[02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:36.821]  800-509-3201.
[02:28:37.501 --> 02:28:39.422]  Pay your creditors and avoid bankruptcy.
[02:28:39.542 --> 02:28:41.863]  Call now.
[02:28:41.883 --> 02:28:42.103]  800-509-3201.
[02:28:42.123 --> 02:28:42.363]  800-509-3201.
[02:28:42.643 --> 02:28:51.928]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:28:52.068 --> 02:28:58.191]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:29:01.413 --> 02:29:14.242]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:29:14.522 --> 02:29:19.365]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:29:19.565 --> 02:29:24.969]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:29:25.329 --> 02:29:28.211]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:29:28.711 --> 02:29:36.638]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:36.718 --> 02:29:37.299]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:47.654 --> 02:29:53.139]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:53.559 --> 02:29:57.802]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:29:58.043 --> 02:30:05.088]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:05.449 --> 02:30:11.574]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:11.714 --> 02:30:12.915]  There are no side effects.
[02:30:13.075 --> 02:30:15.278]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[02:30:30.038 --> 02:30:33.119]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[02:30:33.139 --> 02:30:33.179]  866-885-6625.
[02:30:33.199 --> 02:30:33.499]  866-885-6625.
[02:30:33.539 --> 02:30:34.399]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:30:34.439 --> 02:30:34.739]  Call today.
[02:30:34.799 --> 02:30:36.239]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:30:36.259 --> 02:30:38.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:01.408 --> 02:31:02.869]  The end of analog TV?
[02:31:02.989 --> 02:31:07.690]  Will America's favorite technology really go dark at the beginning of next year?
[02:31:07.710 --> 02:31:10.252]  We'll talk about that here in a few minutes.
[02:31:10.272 --> 02:31:11.372]  Let's continue with your calls.
[02:31:13.173 --> 02:31:14.833]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ramon.
[02:31:15.734 --> 02:31:18.175]  Ramon in Texas, I know some Baha'i folks.
[02:31:18.815 --> 02:31:21.396]  I've watched the TV show probably ten times over the years.
[02:31:22.088 --> 02:31:22.588]  Right, right.
[02:31:22.608 --> 02:31:22.788]  Right.
[02:31:22.808 --> 02:31:23.269]  Right.
[02:31:44.392 --> 02:31:44.512]  Right.
[02:31:44.532 --> 02:31:54.600]  And every time I turn around, they're supporting gun control, they're supporting open borders, they're supporting... So, I mean, please, you're trying to pitch me on how wonderful Baha'i is.
[02:31:54.841 --> 02:31:56.262]  Well, let me put it to you this way.
[02:31:56.822 --> 02:32:04.028]  I've been in Baha'i since I guess 19 and back in 71, but the deal is this.
[02:32:06.270 --> 02:32:09.453]  I think there's another layer that you're not getting behind.
[02:32:10.474 --> 02:32:12.135]  It's similar to, for example...
[02:32:13.283 --> 02:32:18.646]  The globalists, what you could term New World Order people, use the media.
[02:32:19.287 --> 02:32:21.088]  And you also use the media.
[02:32:21.328 --> 02:32:30.776]  Well, the ideas that have been put forth by the Baha'i Faith are co-opted just like money.
[02:32:31.096 --> 02:32:36.160]  Money's not good or evil, but depending on how you use it, the ideas that have been co-opted...
[02:32:37.661 --> 02:32:40.043]  By what you call the New World Order.
[02:32:40.223 --> 02:32:42.605]  I'm talking about produced by Baha'i.
[02:32:43.125 --> 02:32:44.006]  No, no, I understand.
[02:32:44.106 --> 02:32:46.488]  And let me get back to the funding aspect of it.
[02:32:47.168 --> 02:32:54.674]  Absolutely zero, nothing, no funds come to the Baha'i faith except through a member of the Baha'i faith.
[02:32:54.754 --> 02:33:04.601]  And then back in the history, you can look at it, and wealthy, powerful people have tried to join the Baha'i faith and co-opt it, and it didn't work.
[02:33:05.906 --> 02:33:08.368]  Well, in 30 seconds, because I've got more callers.
[02:33:08.808 --> 02:33:10.129]  Tell us what Baha'i is.
[02:33:10.950 --> 02:33:22.839]  Well, basically, I believe, from what I've studied, is that it's a continuation of the same teachings that we have always received from one source.
[02:33:23.039 --> 02:33:24.280]  From the great teachers.
[02:33:25.001 --> 02:33:29.825]  Well, you call them great teachers, you call them messiahs, you call them... From Maitreya.
[02:33:30.876 --> 02:33:32.857]  Well, no, not really.
[02:33:32.877 --> 02:33:34.018]  That's not in the Baha'i faith.
[02:33:34.278 --> 02:33:35.559]  It's all the same thing.
[02:33:35.579 --> 02:33:37.000]  Listen, sir, thanks for the call.
[02:33:37.381 --> 02:33:39.482]  Listen, this is why I don't have a religious show.
[02:33:40.063 --> 02:33:40.783]  I'm a Christian.
[02:33:41.604 --> 02:33:43.285]  The New World Order is satanic.
[02:33:43.565 --> 02:33:44.346]  That's what they believe.
[02:33:44.446 --> 02:33:46.767]  I can say that just news-wise.
[02:33:47.908 --> 02:33:49.529]  The globalists know there's good and evil.
[02:33:51.250 --> 02:33:57.715]  The Christian church has been taken over as a tool of the New World Order, and I am not going to sit here and be proselytized about being a Baha'i.
[02:33:58.772 --> 02:34:01.293]  And now somebody has to call in and attack the Baha'is.
[02:34:01.753 --> 02:34:03.294]  My whole show will be taken up with this.
[02:34:04.794 --> 02:34:05.795]  I do a news show.
[02:34:06.635 --> 02:34:07.655]  I talk about news.
[02:34:07.795 --> 02:34:09.316]  I don't hide what I believe.
[02:34:10.516 --> 02:34:10.896]  Okay?
[02:34:11.757 --> 02:34:14.838]  And I know the New World Order is targeting real Christians.
[02:34:16.578 --> 02:34:17.719]  I know they're gearing up for that.
[02:34:19.560 --> 02:34:23.921]  I know that our mainstream so-called Christians are the front lines of the New World Order.
[02:34:23.941 --> 02:34:24.901]  They're totally taken over.
[02:34:25.242 --> 02:34:26.322]  They're extremely evil.
[02:34:27.034 --> 02:34:29.616]  And I talk about that a lot, because that is important.
[02:34:30.577 --> 02:34:36.282]  But, I mean, there are just a thousand different cults and ideas in India alone.
[02:34:37.003 --> 02:34:37.203]  There's 10,000.
[02:34:39.425 --> 02:34:43.448]  It's a pantheon of stuff, and I don't even want to get into it.
[02:34:44.009 --> 02:34:48.493]  I mean, you had your two or three minutes, and you can hate me now if you want, but please.
[02:34:49.373 --> 02:34:50.214]  Wes in Tennessee.
[02:34:50.274 --> 02:34:50.975]  Wes, go ahead.
[02:34:51.695 --> 02:34:51.976]  Hi.
[02:34:52.356 --> 02:34:52.816]  Hello.
[02:34:53.397 --> 02:34:54.578]  I haven't talked to you in a...
[02:34:55.489 --> 02:34:56.469]  Pretty long time.
[02:34:56.669 --> 02:34:59.710]  I've had some health problems and I just wanted to... Sorry to hear that, Wes.
[02:35:00.190 --> 02:35:01.471]  Well, I'm hanging in there.
[02:35:01.531 --> 02:35:02.871]  The Lord's taking good care of me.
[02:35:03.291 --> 02:35:09.433]  I just wanted to say I hope that my phone call finds you and your family in good spirits and good health.
[02:35:10.894 --> 02:35:11.754]  Well, we are doing well.
[02:35:11.774 --> 02:35:12.854]  We're blessed.
[02:35:13.775 --> 02:35:14.575]  Well, you deserve it.
[02:35:15.235 --> 02:35:15.935]  No, I don't.
[02:35:16.976 --> 02:35:19.016]  Well, you know what I mean.
[02:35:19.836 --> 02:35:21.677]  None of us really deserves anything, but
[02:35:22.335 --> 02:35:22.815]  There are others.
[02:35:22.975 --> 02:35:24.676]  There's some that try harder than others.
[02:35:24.696 --> 02:35:26.356]  I'd say you're in that group.
[02:35:27.036 --> 02:35:30.617]  For those that don't know, Wesley, don't you have muscular sclerosis?
[02:35:31.177 --> 02:35:33.158]  Yeah, I've got muscular dystrophy.
[02:35:33.578 --> 02:35:34.198]  Muscular dystrophy.
[02:35:34.358 --> 02:35:35.718]  You haven't called in about a year.
[02:35:37.299 --> 02:35:39.959]  You've been calling me for probably six years, right?
[02:35:40.160 --> 02:35:40.980]  Yeah.
[02:35:41.580 --> 02:35:42.520]  It was in the newspaper.
[02:35:42.840 --> 02:35:45.761]  You got caught in one of the regular Army checkpoints where
[02:35:46.733 --> 02:35:49.914]  And you were having trouble walking, so they were slamming you around.
[02:35:49.954 --> 02:35:52.834]  The troops were, and they stole your gun out of the trunk.
[02:35:53.415 --> 02:35:54.255]  And it was in the newspaper.
[02:35:54.295 --> 02:35:56.895]  The sheriff says that he uses the troops, and this is part of your freedom.
[02:35:58.656 --> 02:36:07.158]  Yeah, I mean, it's just... Anybody that really thinks that we still live under the United States Constitution is absolutely stone crazy.
[02:36:07.178 --> 02:36:08.938]  They really are.
[02:36:09.318 --> 02:36:12.379]  I mean, they have, for all intents and purposes...
[02:36:13.843 --> 02:36:16.504]  Just take a document and just turn it to shreds.
[02:36:16.965 --> 02:36:25.989]  They just do whatever that argument language, H-E-double-hockey-stick, they darn well feel like doing, and the law be darned.
[02:36:27.750 --> 02:36:31.631]  It's just enough to drive you crazy to see this kind of stuff going on.
[02:36:31.651 --> 02:36:35.653]  This country right now to me, Alex, will help me.
[02:36:36.794 --> 02:36:39.155]  I mean, it's just right from the bottom of my heart.
[02:36:40.222 --> 02:36:52.249]  I'm 60 years old, but I grew up in the 1950s, and I remember all the talk about Russia and about the state schools and how they took the kids away from the parents and put them in the state schools.
[02:36:52.269 --> 02:36:54.491]  It's classical tyranny.
[02:36:55.071 --> 02:36:56.972]  It's right out of the playbook.
[02:36:57.633 --> 02:37:00.614]  Chapter and verse, word for word, exactly.
[02:37:01.275 --> 02:37:01.515]  I mean...
[02:37:02.225 --> 02:37:03.806]  It just absolutely flipped left.
[02:37:03.926 --> 02:37:12.793]  I mean, here we are, living in a country for all intents and purposes, in that very Russia that we were taught about back in the 1950s.
[02:37:12.913 --> 02:37:14.234]  I know, my friend.
[02:37:15.175 --> 02:37:17.456]  And it's just enough to break your heart.
[02:37:17.496 --> 02:37:24.061]  I mean, it was such a fine country, and we tried hard to do the right thing.
[02:37:24.081 --> 02:37:25.803]  We really did for years.
[02:37:27.024 --> 02:37:28.865]  But we manipulated our good intentions.
[02:37:28.905 --> 02:37:31.067]  Well, my friend, it's good to have you call back in.
[02:37:31.127 --> 02:37:31.447]  Thank you.
[02:37:32.250 --> 02:37:32.530]  Thank you.
[02:37:32.550 --> 02:37:33.050]  I appreciate that.
[02:37:33.130 --> 02:37:33.710]  Anything else?
[02:37:34.450 --> 02:37:34.990]  Not a thing.
[02:37:35.010 --> 02:37:41.492]  I've got more to talk about, but there's guys lying behind me, so I'll just get the heck out of their way.
[02:37:42.152 --> 02:37:44.652]  God bless you, and God bless your family, too.
[02:37:44.772 --> 02:37:45.872]  Well, thank you, my friend.
[02:37:45.912 --> 02:37:47.153]  The same goes for you.
[02:37:47.693 --> 02:37:48.333]  Thank you, Wes.
[02:37:48.513 --> 02:37:49.133]  Good to hear from you.
[02:37:49.953 --> 02:37:51.673]  Dave, where are you calling us from?
[02:37:52.213 --> 02:37:52.674]  Michigan.
[02:37:53.314 --> 02:37:53.634]  Welcome.
[02:37:53.654 --> 02:37:59.955]  I talked to you last week about having a problem copying your new movie, Martial Law 9-11, and I've solved the problem.
[02:37:59.975 --> 02:38:00.855]  I wanted to share it with you.
[02:38:02.354 --> 02:38:03.935]  There's not copy protect on it.
[02:38:04.296 --> 02:38:05.156]  It's a DVD-9.
[02:38:05.417 --> 02:38:08.920]  It has zero country code, meaning it works everywhere on the planet.
[02:38:09.280 --> 02:38:10.501]  And there's no copy protect.
[02:38:10.541 --> 02:38:13.985]  It's just you've got to have a DVD-9 copier, which are about $50 now.
[02:38:14.085 --> 02:38:15.306]  All right.
[02:38:15.426 --> 02:38:19.390]  Well, I actually managed to do it with a little software program that
[02:38:19.827 --> 02:38:25.788]  I copied the structure of the CD as an image.
[02:38:26.329 --> 02:38:28.649]  But what the problem was, was the media.
[02:38:28.849 --> 02:38:39.672]  I went up to a TDK disc, and now not only does it work in my small portable Panasonic player, but it works in my six-year-old original DVD player I bought when they first came out.
[02:38:39.732 --> 02:38:40.272]  It's amazing.
[02:38:41.292 --> 02:38:42.273]  Well, that's great.
[02:38:42.333 --> 02:38:47.714]  Also, if you're a member of PrisonPlanet.tv, you can sit there burning them all day to a single little disc that costs 50 cents.
[02:38:48.758 --> 02:39:05.711]  Oh, well, yeah, but what I'm doing is I went out and actually bought some blank DVD cases, labels, and I'm making the package look just like an original, so that when I give them away to people, it's like something that they have that looks like something, instead of just giving them a disc with writing on it.
[02:39:05.751 --> 02:39:09.094]  No, it's got the eye candy, and a lot of listeners do that, and I salute you.
[02:39:09.594 --> 02:39:12.677]  Thank you, Alex, and thanks for the great job you're doing.
[02:39:12.757 --> 02:39:14.078]  The movie's fantastic.
[02:39:14.751 --> 02:39:25.127]  And I think it's just the right blend of information versus... Well, I don't know what the word would be, but I think it's done in such a way that is...
[02:39:27.572 --> 02:39:32.055]  More appealing to those who have no idea what's going on.
[02:39:32.956 --> 02:39:35.398]  We show them it physically happening.
[02:39:35.658 --> 02:39:38.861]  We make a claim, and then look, here in New York it's happening.
[02:39:39.241 --> 02:39:40.623]  These people do rituals.
[02:39:40.943 --> 02:39:42.284]  Oh, hello, sir, do you do rituals?
[02:39:42.304 --> 02:39:43.185]  Ah, shut up!
[02:39:43.725 --> 02:39:45.387]  You know what I mean?
[02:39:45.487 --> 02:39:46.988]  We make a claim, then we show you.
[02:39:47.508 --> 02:39:48.009]  Exactly.
[02:39:48.209 --> 02:39:50.991]  We don't just show the documents, then we show you it actually happening.
[02:39:51.532 --> 02:39:51.692]  Mm-hmm.
[02:39:52.714 --> 02:39:54.955]  Great job, Alex, and I hope to meet you someday.
[02:39:54.975 --> 02:39:56.395]  Well, I hope to meet you.
[02:39:56.455 --> 02:39:57.135]  Take care, Dave.
[02:39:58.116 --> 02:40:00.256]  Let's take another call.
[02:40:00.276 --> 02:40:01.357]  Who's the next here in line?
[02:40:03.297 --> 02:40:04.518]  Phillip in South Carolina.
[02:40:04.558 --> 02:40:05.138]  Welcome, sir.
[02:40:06.218 --> 02:40:06.438]  Hey, Alex.
[02:40:06.458 --> 02:40:06.838]  How are you doing?
[02:40:07.199 --> 02:40:07.459]  Good.
[02:40:07.479 --> 02:40:11.020]  Yeah, I saw your 9-11 martial law.
[02:40:11.040 --> 02:40:11.300]  I loved it.
[02:40:11.340 --> 02:40:13.581]  I thought it was a great DVD.
[02:40:13.701 --> 02:40:19.442]  I've got most of your DVDs, and I've watched a lot of other stuff, too, but I was pulling into my driveway a minute ago, and guess what I saw up at the sky?
[02:40:20.623 --> 02:40:21.043]  A blimp.
[02:40:21.741 --> 02:40:22.042]  Yeah.
[02:40:22.923 --> 02:40:23.944]  I was like, that was great.
[02:40:23.984 --> 02:40:25.285]  I just watched your DVD last week.
[02:40:25.866 --> 02:40:27.448]  But, yeah, I just got a question.
[02:40:27.468 --> 02:40:28.509]  Well, what did the Blunts say?
[02:40:29.887 --> 02:40:31.307]  It looked just like the one you saw.
[02:40:31.367 --> 02:40:35.868]  I didn't read everything on it, but it was white and green and it said Fuji and it was flying right over.
[02:40:35.888 --> 02:40:37.769]  I didn't get out there and study it or anything.
[02:40:37.789 --> 02:40:40.869]  For those who don't know now, Fuji's doing deals with communities.
[02:40:40.889 --> 02:40:53.972]  You just drop into town for a week or two and surveil people and they put the name of the police department on the side and just getting us used to it and now they're funding the construction of dozens of giant dirigibles or zeppelins.
[02:40:55.032 --> 02:41:12.298]  To mill about and to permanently be over all the major cities, any city over 3 million, Houston, Dallas, Chicago, LA, New York, DC, Boston, Miami, and permanently with systems that look right through our walls.
[02:41:15.379 --> 02:41:16.579]  Go ahead.
[02:41:16.859 --> 02:41:18.120]  Also, I've got a couple questions.
[02:41:19.226 --> 02:41:24.490]  So you've got the CFR, the Trilateral, the Middleburgers, and all the evil guys who want the new world order.
[02:41:25.031 --> 02:41:34.498]  So I was thinking about why not the good guys like you and maybe the power, I don't know if you're down with those guys, but I think they've got a good message they're trying to get across.
[02:41:34.738 --> 02:41:40.803]  And you all could all be your own group, and you could all meet two or three times a year and discuss how we're going to push the freedom.
[02:41:41.124 --> 02:41:42.545]  Well, yeah, I mean, I'm down with them.
[02:41:42.645 --> 02:41:43.706]  I mean, they're on the network.
[02:41:43.726 --> 02:41:45.247]  They do a great job.
[02:41:45.836 --> 02:41:46.096]  Okay.
[02:41:46.577 --> 02:41:48.520]  But, look, this is our strength.
[02:41:48.680 --> 02:41:50.983]  Our strength is you, Phillip.
[02:41:52.405 --> 02:42:00.437]  If we try to be a centralized system, if we are easy to infiltrate, to implicate, to frame, to provocateur...
[02:42:01.365 --> 02:42:02.425]  We're good to go.
[02:42:02.445 --> 02:42:02.625]  I think?
[02:42:19.600 --> 02:42:35.005]  Organic network, literally, like a huge computer, all our minds together, tied together, acting independently and in concert, overanalyzing, and I mean that in a positive way, what the globalists can even do.
[02:42:35.996 --> 02:42:36.637]  We're good to go.
[02:42:53.295 --> 02:43:05.507]  And they, within another five years, will have only 10% of the viewers and listeners and readers that the alternative anti-New World Order press has.
[02:43:05.867 --> 02:43:09.691]  Right now, we already are bigger than they are.
[02:43:09.871 --> 02:43:11.332]  We've now crossed that threshold.
[02:43:11.352 --> 02:43:12.113]  They're panicking.
[02:43:12.794 --> 02:43:13.835]  They may nuke cities.
[02:43:13.855 --> 02:43:15.096]  They may shut the web off.
[02:43:15.136 --> 02:43:17.578]  They may do anything to maintain their power.
[02:43:18.752 --> 02:43:25.015]  But the problem is, those of us that are in the alternative media still listen to the globalists and believe their propaganda that they're invincible.
[02:43:25.455 --> 02:43:36.881]  They're actually imploding right now, and all of this acceleration of their program is simply a desperate death throes, desperate pincer attack, and it's going to fail.
[02:43:37.321 --> 02:43:45.185]  They can nuke cities, they can release smallpox, they can have a sweep and kill the thousand top patriot leaders tomorrow.
[02:43:46.425 --> 02:43:47.266]  It's over for them.
[02:43:48.130 --> 02:43:49.191]  They can't get us all.
[02:43:49.231 --> 02:43:50.351]  There's nothing they can do.
[02:43:50.451 --> 02:43:51.352]  We're going to win.
[02:43:52.192 --> 02:43:58.275]  The New World Order is going to have its time on this earth, but it's going to be very, very short.
[02:43:59.035 --> 02:44:07.519]  And so the cataclysm, the clash of civilizations, the clash of good and evil is now taking place.
[02:44:07.659 --> 02:44:10.400]  And God has told us to be on the field.
[02:44:10.920 --> 02:44:14.482]  When the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord lifts up a standard against it.
[02:44:15.240 --> 02:44:16.242]  And that is happening.
[02:44:16.362 --> 02:44:18.105]  Are you that standard, Phil?
[02:44:18.466 --> 02:44:19.267]  I think you are.
[02:44:19.387 --> 02:44:23.014]  So the key is it isn't having some conclave or some...
[02:44:23.932 --> 02:44:31.077]  Meeting some commission or congress where we sit around as the leaders pontificating on what the strategy should be.
[02:44:31.357 --> 02:44:33.759]  The strategy is go forth and engage evil.
[02:44:34.119 --> 02:44:36.041]  The strategy is go forth and be good.
[02:44:36.061 --> 02:44:38.562]  The strategy is love your family, love your neighbor.
[02:44:38.843 --> 02:44:40.544]  The strategy is don't have fear.
[02:44:40.604 --> 02:44:42.105]  The strategy is be strong.
[02:44:42.405 --> 02:44:45.747]  The strategy is be thankful.
[02:44:46.148 --> 02:44:49.010]  The strategy is research.
[02:44:49.090 --> 02:44:50.691]  The strategy is take action.
[02:44:50.791 --> 02:44:51.051]  Okay?
[02:44:51.992 --> 02:44:52.212]  Got it.
[02:44:53.041 --> 02:44:53.741]  Thank you, my friend.
[02:44:53.781 --> 02:44:57.203]  Really good question, though, and I appreciate you raising it.
[02:44:58.604 --> 02:45:01.386]  You know, so many people, too, try to imitate what I do.
[02:45:03.447 --> 02:45:05.188]  Often imitated, never duplicated.
[02:45:05.208 --> 02:45:07.789]  And I said in the first hour, that's unfortunate.
[02:45:08.369 --> 02:45:14.453]  People out there with their own talents and skills should not predominantly try to imitate what I do.
[02:45:14.653 --> 02:45:16.754]  And that's what basically everybody's doing.
[02:45:18.450 --> 02:45:24.492]  Which is a great form of flattery, but many of these individuals have their own skills and should just be themselves.
[02:45:25.553 --> 02:45:26.733]  That's what needs to happen.
[02:45:27.594 --> 02:45:31.596]  It weakens us when we only come at this from one aspect.
[02:45:32.616 --> 02:45:37.318]  Truly, I do have a detailed understanding of the New World Order, but it's not complete.
[02:45:38.479 --> 02:45:41.080]  I've been in organic growth.
[02:45:42.170 --> 02:45:44.472]  Of the human species to resist tyranny.
[02:45:45.493 --> 02:45:48.516]  For every action there's an equal or greater reaction, as I love to say.
[02:45:49.537 --> 02:45:58.864]  But I would challenge people to research things themselves and come up with their own information, their own ideas, their own plans, and to implement those.
[02:46:00.926 --> 02:46:06.831]  It is dangerous to only have one battle plan.
[02:46:07.811 --> 02:46:13.753]  It is dangerous to only have one particular view or mode of expressing that paradigm.
[02:46:14.673 --> 02:46:16.974]  We need to be individuals first and foremost.
[02:46:17.514 --> 02:46:31.438]  That is the number one, and I mean real individuals, not phony individuals that pick up whatever fake counterculture spin-off propaganda that has been hoisted on us by the establishment in an attempt to control societal evolution.
[02:46:32.825 --> 02:46:38.327]  I use that word evolution, again, in societal evolution, not in evolution as it is taught in schools.
[02:46:38.768 --> 02:46:40.888]  I mean in our development, our understandings.
[02:46:41.369 --> 02:46:44.090]  The evolution of saying the world is not flat, it is round.
[02:46:44.510 --> 02:46:51.413]  The evolution of saying the world is not the center of the universe, it orbits the standard of the sun, two-thirds of the way out of the spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.
[02:46:53.160 --> 02:46:55.423]  So by evolution, I mean in our understanding.
[02:46:55.563 --> 02:46:59.848]  And much of our evolution of understanding is going back to the founding documents.
[02:47:00.149 --> 02:47:11.162]  Whether it be what we got on Mount Sinai, or the Magna Carta in 1214, or in 1776 with the Declaration of Independence, or 1789 with the Bill of Rights and Constitution of the 13 states.
[02:47:13.274 --> 02:47:23.162]  It's now time to relearn what we have never been taught or have forgotten, and it's time to integrate that with the new technological developments of our age.
[02:47:23.182 --> 02:47:24.623]  I mean, there's so many facets to this.
[02:47:25.284 --> 02:47:26.004]  Just think about this.
[02:47:26.024 --> 02:47:28.526]  By 2010, half the Air Force will be unmanned.
[02:47:28.546 --> 02:47:29.227]  By 2015, 70% will be unmanned.
[02:47:29.247 --> 02:47:30.608]  They say by 2020, over 90% will be unmanned.
[02:47:40.174 --> 02:47:42.677]  The only thing in the sky is it'll have actual people on it.
[02:47:42.957 --> 02:47:44.058]  There'll be troop carriers.
[02:47:46.580 --> 02:47:54.548]  And so when you watch a science fiction movie set a thousand years in the future and people are flying their jet fighters around in space, it's ridiculous.
[02:47:56.070 --> 02:47:57.491]  The shift is already here.
[02:47:57.931 --> 02:47:59.233]  The future is already here.
[02:47:59.313 --> 02:48:00.514]  The microchip is here.
[02:48:01.214 --> 02:48:03.637]  The vaccines engineered into the food is here.
[02:48:04.494 --> 02:48:08.035]  The human genes in the food is already here.
[02:48:08.476 --> 02:48:12.677]  The pharmacological corn with live HIV virus is already here.
[02:48:13.577 --> 02:48:15.478]  All of this, the human cloning is here.
[02:48:16.198 --> 02:48:18.659]  Artificially intelligent computers are here.
[02:48:19.680 --> 02:48:25.522]  Self-aware beast computers are around the corner that's not already self-aware.
[02:48:28.556 --> 02:48:31.197]  The globalists, ladies and gentlemen, are a cancer.
[02:48:31.438 --> 02:48:32.598]  They are a disease.
[02:48:33.018 --> 02:48:34.919]  They have spread for the species.
[02:48:35.360 --> 02:48:36.780]  They must be exiled.
[02:48:37.741 --> 02:48:40.982]  You know it's true in your guts and in your cerebral cortex.
[02:48:41.763 --> 02:48:44.444]  Join us in the battle for the human species.
[02:48:46.685 --> 02:48:49.567]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?

[02:49:22.738 --> 02:49:24.561]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:51:48.479 --> 02:51:54.500]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:51:55.120 --> 02:51:58.100]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:53:03.506 --> 02:53:06.708]  The end of analog TV, this out of MSNBC, will America's favorite television
[02:53:13.578 --> 02:53:36.604]  Technology really go dark next year, and that's the date set for December 31st, 2006, and it's going to force all the other TV stations in the country to buy these multi-million dollar transmitters, and it makes you buy multi-thousand dollar TV sets, or you have to buy the adapter, and then it screws your picture up.
[02:53:37.424 --> 02:53:40.605]  And I'm all for new technology, but do not make you
[02:53:41.583 --> 02:53:41.943]  Buy it.
[02:53:42.404 --> 02:53:43.544]  Do not make you take it.
[02:53:43.724 --> 02:53:44.705]  And this is how they do it.
[02:53:45.565 --> 02:53:53.869]  Depending on how the outcome of discussions in Congress this week, television as we know it may end exactly at midnight, December 31st, 2006.
[02:53:54.269 --> 02:54:01.452]  That's the date Congress targeted a decade ago for the end of analog television broadcast and a full cutover to digital format.
[02:54:02.433 --> 02:54:03.333]  Same thing with radio.
[02:54:03.353 --> 02:54:05.954]  It's going to really hurt a lot of small stations.
[02:54:05.974 --> 02:54:07.835]  It doesn't transmit as well.
[02:54:08.550 --> 02:54:16.872]  It does add more space on the dial, but FCCs are not going to give you that space, and you're not going to be able to buy the multi-million dollar transmitters.
[02:54:16.992 --> 02:54:18.993]  Let's talk to Travis in Washington.
[02:54:19.033 --> 02:54:19.873]  Travis, go ahead.
[02:54:19.893 --> 02:54:20.833]  Hi, Alex.
[02:54:21.093 --> 02:54:21.393]  Yes, sir.
[02:54:21.633 --> 02:54:23.094]  I just got a quick comment.
[02:54:23.534 --> 02:54:31.356]  I myself am a Christian, and everything that I've seen on your website and everything I've gathered even before looking at your website, it makes things come together like a big puzzle.
[02:54:31.997 --> 02:54:39.501]  And when I try to spread information to people that don't believe in God or has never known Christ, you can tell the look of baffle on their face because they don't get it.
[02:54:40.341 --> 02:54:48.966]  So just by that one caller, I just wanted to make the comment that unless you believe in God, this stuff doesn't really come together like a big puzzle like it does for me.
[02:54:49.186 --> 02:54:51.007]  And that's pretty much all my comment.
[02:54:51.687 --> 02:54:52.588]  Well, thank you, sir.
[02:54:53.028 --> 02:55:00.272]  I mean, I've found that if people just learn about the New World Order, they wake up to it and they wake up to who's behind it.
[02:55:02.075 --> 02:55:03.616]  They find Christ very quickly.
[02:55:04.677 --> 02:55:13.200]  But so many liberals and people look at what supposed Christians are, these neocons, and they go, I don't want anything to do with that, and boy, I don't blame them.
[02:55:13.240 --> 02:55:14.941]  But that's a counterfeit, folks.
[02:55:15.921 --> 02:55:17.802]  Rick in Ohio, last caller, go ahead.
[02:55:18.162 --> 02:55:18.582]  Hey, Alex.
[02:55:19.223 --> 02:55:20.803]  I talked to you a while ago.
[02:55:20.823 --> 02:55:24.985]  I was the guy that wrote the book about supply-side economics and globalization.
[02:55:25.740 --> 02:55:27.961]  Redistribution of wealth and so forth.
[02:55:27.981 --> 02:55:29.841]  That's what it's designed to do, yeah.
[02:55:29.941 --> 02:55:36.863]  And what I talk about in the book is how the conservative movement, which was started back with Reagan.
[02:55:37.623 --> 02:55:45.085]  If you look at regulation, the opposite of rules and regulations are deregulation.
[02:55:45.765 --> 02:55:49.046]  So all of this started back when Reagan...
[02:55:49.682 --> 02:55:53.383]  But it isn't deregulating it.
[02:55:53.423 --> 02:55:55.703]  They just give it to their friends to run the economy.
[02:55:55.743 --> 02:55:59.304]  No, the worse everything gets, and they keep telling us how great it is.
[02:55:59.344 --> 02:56:01.265]  You've got to call me back.
[02:56:13.918 --> 02:56:14.818]  Let's simplify it.
[02:56:15.078 --> 02:56:21.883]  They socialize the wealth and get us domesticated, like a bunch of pigs, and then privatization is slaughtering the pigs.
[02:56:22.904 --> 02:56:26.746]  It's giving the government over to the private corporations that now will act as the government.
[02:56:27.567 --> 02:56:29.969]  Alright, back tonight, 9 to midnight, back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:30.889 --> 02:56:31.770]  God bless you all.
[02:56:31.810 --> 02:56:33.211]  Get out there and take on the New World Order.
