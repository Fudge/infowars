[00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:06.343]  Big brother.
[00:00:07.046 --> 00:00:08.106]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.827 --> 00:00:09.967]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.567 --> 00:00:11.427]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.147 --> 00:00:13.668]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.708 --> 00:00:17.389]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:21.970]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.512]  Alright my friends, it is Thursday, the 21st day of April 2005.
[00:00:43.692 --> 00:00:48.874]  Masses of vital news and information today, and two great guests as well, perhaps three great guests.
[00:00:49.734 --> 00:00:53.856]  Greenspan warns rising deficits endanger economy.
[00:00:55.316 --> 00:01:03.699]  You gotta love it when they carry out the economic policies and order the economic policies that cause our economy to constrict.
[00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:10.087]  And then they pose as our saviors after they engage in the problem creation.
[00:01:10.127 --> 00:01:10.968]  We'll go over that.
[00:01:11.688 --> 00:01:14.650]  Urgent action needed on Real ID Act.
[00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.391]  This is on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:01:17.451 --> 00:01:19.732]  A tri-national ID card merging U.S.
[00:01:19.752 --> 00:01:26.496]  driver's license databases with Canada and Mexico to be passed under the banner of 9-11 today.
[00:01:27.396 --> 00:01:29.017]  And it's an urgent action alert.
[00:01:29.037 --> 00:01:31.418]  It is the Pan-American Union ID card.
[00:01:32.372 --> 00:01:38.634]  And the Mexican and Canadian newspapers are openly saying this is the Pan-American Union.
[00:01:38.694 --> 00:01:39.634]  It's all happening.
[00:01:40.255 --> 00:01:43.596]  The average American has no idea that this is even going on.
[00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:46.317]  So details on that after this first break.
[00:01:47.617 --> 00:01:49.378]  Privacy groups slam U.S.
[00:01:49.438 --> 00:01:51.819]  passport technology, where U.S.
[00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:54.639]  citizens have to have all these tracker chips in their passports.
[00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.480]  But again, the illegal aliens don't.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.941]  They'll all be legalized.
[00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:03.940]  Schwarzenegger is sorry for his border comment.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.822]  Now, yesterday I actually read what he said, and what his spokesman said.
[00:02:13.082 --> 00:02:20.144]  And that was, we need to close the borders, we need to pass President Bush's guest worker program.
[00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:30.076]  More double speak, more double think, but they know the general public just listen to what they say and don't actually check out the legislation.
[00:02:30.536 --> 00:02:50.432]  Anyone who's looked at the legislation knows that it is blanket total amnesty for anyone that is in the United States or anyone who can get here for the next six years and it allows companies to pay to bring skilled and unskilled workers here.
[00:02:52.322 --> 00:02:54.184]  It is the biggest amnesty plan.
[00:02:54.244 --> 00:02:56.246]  It dwarfs what Ronald Reagan did.
[00:02:56.767 --> 00:02:59.149]  It dwarfs what Bill Clinton did.
[00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.531]  They pale in significance.
[00:03:00.891 --> 00:03:03.834]  The numbers are astronomically larger.
[00:03:05.596 --> 00:03:07.058]  But this is how they spin things.
[00:03:07.578 --> 00:03:08.820]  Close the borders.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.464]  Enact President Bush's guest worker program now!
[00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:15.832]  And then I'm getting the emails already.
[00:03:15.892 --> 00:03:17.212]  Yeah, Alex, see?
[00:03:17.652 --> 00:03:18.913]  He's for controlling the borders.
[00:03:18.953 --> 00:03:19.913]  I got these last night.
[00:03:20.353 --> 00:03:21.533]  He's for controlling the borders.
[00:03:21.573 --> 00:03:22.374]  You're wrong!
[00:03:22.974 --> 00:03:24.754]  And you need to get behind President Bush!
[00:03:24.854 --> 00:03:25.414]  Liberal!
[00:03:27.255 --> 00:03:27.975]  Okay, fine.
[00:03:28.015 --> 00:03:28.916]  Be kind if you want to.
[00:03:28.956 --> 00:03:37.318]  But now, on the heels of that, he's come out and said, Yesterday was a total screw-up, in the words I used.
[00:03:37.758 --> 00:03:39.279]  What I meant was, secure them.
[00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:43.580]  And pass President Bush's plan immediately.
[00:03:45.783 --> 00:03:47.304]  Oh, one of your legs is sawed off.
[00:03:47.344 --> 00:03:48.524]  Here, let's cut the other one off.
[00:03:48.564 --> 00:03:54.586]  In fact, the analogy I've used, the parallel I've used, is the police announced tomorrow there's no more murder.
[00:03:54.606 --> 00:03:58.408]  There'll never be another murder in America, in the United States.
[00:03:58.448 --> 00:03:58.748]  Oh, really?
[00:03:58.768 --> 00:03:59.428]  How are you doing that?
[00:03:59.928 --> 00:04:06.931]  Well, we're just legalizing killing people for no reason, and we're also not going to call it murder anymore.
[00:04:06.951 --> 00:04:11.853]  We're going to call it love, or retirement, or something like that.
[00:04:12.598 --> 00:04:13.599]  Oh, no more murder!
[00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:13.859]  Good!
[00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:14.960]  No more illegal aliens!
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.741]  They're all legal!
[00:04:16.021 --> 00:04:19.704]  Wow, you're really hardcore against the, uh, open borders, Arnold.
[00:04:21.825 --> 00:04:23.366]  It makes my head spin sometimes.
[00:04:23.466 --> 00:04:38.918]  Uh, by the way, uh, pirates, people online, uh, file sharing, especially those that engage in pre-release file sharing, could receive jail time and bill set to pass Congress.
[00:04:40.808 --> 00:04:42.389]  Helicopter's been shot down in Iraq.
[00:04:42.429 --> 00:04:42.909]  Nine dead.
[00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:47.431]  I'm gonna do about 30 minutes of news, then we'll take your calls.
[00:04:48.351 --> 00:04:49.532]  Big show lined up today.
[00:04:49.592 --> 00:04:58.096]  We've got Jimmy Vaughn, Sal Costello, and I just thought of getting somebody on from Ron Paul's office to talk about this legislation, so we'll probably do that too.
[00:05:01.212 --> 00:05:05.556]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.757 --> 00:05:10.161]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.301 --> 00:05:14.685]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.725 --> 00:05:16.087]  The New World Order.
[00:05:16.867 --> 00:05:17.808]  Panama.
[00:05:17.868 --> 00:05:22.092]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:22.152 --> 00:05:29.098]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.218 --> 00:05:31.260]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:41.929]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:42.910]  If you want to understand
[00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.596]  If you don't understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police State 3, is for you!

[00:06:04.397 --> 00:06:07.900]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.

[00:06:12.184 --> 00:06:18.349]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.

[00:06:59.511 --> 00:07:02.894]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[00:07:03.134 --> 00:07:03.454]  Why?
[00:07:03.474 --> 00:07:06.436]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of Cardivite?

[00:08:01.943 --> 00:08:10.474]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.574 --> 00:08:14.919]  Eight minutes, ten seconds into this first hour, second segment.
[00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.082]  It is the 21st day of April, 2005.
[00:08:17.122 --> 00:08:18.043]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:20.979 --> 00:08:32.426]  We're fighting the toll roads here in Central Texas and it has been reported by the national press including USA Today and the Washington Post that Texas is the frontline battle state.
[00:08:32.626 --> 00:08:50.156]  It is the bellwether that is being observed by the other 49 states as they move to carry out federal mandates for transponder, tracked and controlled toll roads on almost every state, federal and local right-of-way, road.
[00:08:51.457 --> 00:08:53.279]  Total control, total grid.
[00:08:54.279 --> 00:09:00.024]  And we've got a model here in Central Texas to fight it.
[00:09:00.044 --> 00:09:07.690]  45,000 people, just under 45,000 people signed the petition to recall the mayor who went along with the unelected state board to do this.
[00:09:09.972 --> 00:09:16.978]  And they had to get 45,000 because the city told them that they would throw out at least 10,000 of them.
[00:09:16.998 --> 00:09:17.338]  They needed 35,000.
[00:09:19.139 --> 00:09:24.401]  And so they withdrew their petition, but the mayor now, it looks like, is in big political trouble.
[00:09:25.301 --> 00:09:43.187]  And coming up tonight, that is the 21st of April, 2005, at the Doubletree North, really nice hotel and a big banquet hall that can hold 2,000 people, Jimmy Vaughn and many other
[00:09:44.961 --> 00:09:48.764]  Award-winning musicians are putting on a benefit concert.
[00:09:49.364 --> 00:10:00.292]  They're doing it free of charge, but the tickets are $25 online or via the ticket offices and $30 at the door.
[00:10:00.913 --> 00:10:10.420]  And every red cent of it is going to sue state and local officials and to create a political war chest to run candidates against them.
[00:10:11.858 --> 00:10:23.403]  And of course I have been invited, I'm honored to be invited to speak briefly and of course introduce Jimmy Vaughn and his wonderful blues band that is Grammy Award winning.
[00:10:23.423 --> 00:10:30.086]  There's going to be other Grammy Award winners there as well that are on the list and there could be some surprise guests!
[00:10:30.727 --> 00:10:35.649]  So believe me, you want to get tickets to this
[00:10:36.388 --> 00:10:50.196]  Go to AustinTollParty.com and we have links on InfoWars.com to the section on the site where you can purchase the tickets and it's also sold by some of the big mainstream ticket outfits or you can just show up at the door this evening.
[00:10:51.537 --> 00:10:52.538]  It could sell out.
[00:10:53.158 --> 00:10:56.400]  I hope it sells out and I would treat it as if it's going to sell out.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:02.424]  I know that most Austinites and Central Texans like to buy tickets at the door but
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:13.585]  I know that I've got my tickets, even though I don't need tickets, I've got tickets, because we want to support what they're doing.
[00:11:13.605 --> 00:11:17.286]  In fact, I've bought some other tickets and given them to friends and family.
[00:11:19.067 --> 00:11:24.150]  So I hope that you will come out there tonight.
[00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:25.030]  I hope to see you.
[00:11:26.671 --> 00:11:27.731]  I've got to call my dad.
[00:11:27.751 --> 00:11:32.794]  I know he wants to go and I've got a few extra tickets and I haven't called him back in the last few days.
[00:11:33.846 --> 00:11:37.508]  See if my dad wants to come stay out late with us and come to it.
[00:11:37.808 --> 00:11:39.089]  I know he's a fan of Jimmy Vaughn.
[00:11:39.109 --> 00:11:39.949]  He loves blues.
[00:11:40.469 --> 00:11:44.971]  That's his favorite music and I know he's got quite a few of their CDs.
[00:11:45.011 --> 00:11:47.753]  So that'll be a real treat if I can drag him out to that.
[00:11:47.773 --> 00:11:48.353]  I know he wants to go.
[00:11:48.373 --> 00:11:50.474]  I don't know if he can stay up late with us.
[00:11:50.974 --> 00:11:54.116]  He's got to get up early and be a good little dentist.
[00:11:54.196 --> 00:11:58.958]  But to the start at 7.30 and run until midnight.
[00:11:59.776 --> 00:12:03.897]  And Jimmy Vaughn is going to be taking the stage at 10 p.m.
[00:12:04.438 --> 00:12:09.479]  But it is a star-studded lineup, so I hope to see you out there again tonight.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.581]  Jimmy Vaughn is going to be coming on briefly.
[00:12:13.621 --> 00:12:18.863]  I know he's busy, so I just asked him to come on for 15-20 minutes at the start of the next hour.
[00:12:18.883 --> 00:12:22.664]  And we're going to have with him, riding shotgun, Sal Costello.
[00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:31.074]  Who's just another grassroots Austinite who got sick and tired of being sick and tired and launched about a year ago the Austin Toll Party.
[00:12:33.236 --> 00:12:44.624]  And so now the Austin Toll Party has what, over 50,000 people that are what you'd call unofficial members or who have contacted and got involved, 45,000 as we said earlier, or 44,000 to be accurate, that signed the petition.
[00:12:46.185 --> 00:12:47.626]  But again, that's coming up in the next hour.
[00:12:47.726 --> 00:12:51.408]  And regardless of where you live in the country, you better pay attention to this.
[00:12:51.528 --> 00:12:52.109]  I mean, I've been
[00:12:53.095 --> 00:12:56.856]  Barking on this subject for eight years since I learned of it.
[00:12:56.936 --> 00:13:07.500]  And look, I don't get up on the air every day and say, I've been telling you this for five years, for ten years, for eight years, depending on what subject it is, because I want you to be impressed.
[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:13.042]  It's because we know what we're talking about, we have the documents, we have the credibility.
[00:13:13.462 --> 00:13:15.323]  No matter how crazy and painful
[00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:21.119]  And out of control all this stuff sounds, we're just going off the documents.
[00:13:21.499 --> 00:13:23.122]  We're going off the legislation.
[00:13:23.924 --> 00:13:29.274]  We're going off the statements of the think tanks that set policy and run this country.
[00:13:30.345 --> 00:13:38.852]  We're going off what the globalists say at CFR meetings on C-SPAN, and what they say they're going to do at the Davos Switzerland World Economic Forum.
[00:13:39.072 --> 00:13:45.057]  What the WTO, the World Trade Organization, says they're going to do, what they put in policy.
[00:13:45.537 --> 00:13:48.980]  We're going off what the World Health Organization says their plan is.
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.282]  We're going off their own stated plan.
[00:13:53.443 --> 00:13:54.724]  That's all we're doing.
[00:13:55.625 --> 00:13:59.328]  I get emails every week, oh you must be psychic, I thought you were a kook five years ago.
[00:14:00.075 --> 00:14:01.776]  You heard the calls yesterday, several of them.
[00:14:02.197 --> 00:14:03.338]  I thought you were a nut.
[00:14:04.138 --> 00:14:05.759]  But everything you've said has come true.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:06.780]  How did you know?
[00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:07.661]  Are you psychic?
[00:14:08.161 --> 00:14:09.562]  Are you a remote viewer?
[00:14:10.503 --> 00:14:14.466]  No, ladies and gentlemen, I go off the government documents!
[00:14:16.948 --> 00:14:18.929]  And it's time to stop living in denial.
[00:14:18.989 --> 00:14:21.551]  It's time to stand up and get involved against what we're facing.
[00:14:23.793 --> 00:14:25.054]  Alright, that's enough ranting.
[00:14:26.114 --> 00:14:27.435]  Let's plunge into the news.
[00:14:27.535 --> 00:14:28.316]  But listen.
[00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:30.350]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:31.590]  Come to this event tonight.
[00:14:32.531 --> 00:14:37.573]  Greenspan warns rising deficits endanger economy.
[00:14:38.814 --> 00:14:46.978]  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned on Thursday that unless lawmakers come to grips with spiraling U.S.
[00:14:47.018 --> 00:14:51.961]  deficits, the economy was at risk of strangulation or worse.
[00:14:54.705 --> 00:14:57.673]  I was having a Freudian slip there about Mr. Greenspan.
[00:14:58.154 --> 00:15:01.202]  Risk of stagnation or worse, excuse me.
[00:15:01.783 --> 00:15:02.785]  Not strangulation.
[00:15:04.217 --> 00:15:27.661]  Under existing tax rates and reasonable assumptions about other spending, projections make clear that the federal budget is on an unsustainable path in which large deficits result in rising interest rates and ever-growing interest payments that augment deficits in future years, Greenspan said in testimony prepared for the Senate Budget Committee hearing.
[00:15:28.481 --> 00:15:32.002]  Unless the trend is reversed, here let me do his voice, unless the
[00:15:32.987 --> 00:15:33.987]  Trend is reversed.
[00:15:34.588 --> 00:15:38.349]  At some point, these deficits would cause the economy to stagnate or worse.
[00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:42.471]  Okay, again, I've got to stop right there.
[00:15:43.711 --> 00:15:47.853]  The globalists blow up buildings and then say they're going to save us by taking our rights.
[00:15:49.673 --> 00:15:59.177]  The New World Order, the Federal Reserve, controls our Treasury and basically orders the government around and has set the policies that caused all of this deficit spending.
[00:15:59.237 --> 00:16:01.998]  They are the people running the entire operation.
[00:16:03.177 --> 00:16:10.701]  They were the ones that jacked up the stock market while at the same time saying, watch out for irrational exuberance.
[00:16:10.921 --> 00:16:14.683]  And then, when things plunge, they take the credit for warning us.
[00:16:14.823 --> 00:16:16.464]  You've really got to love it.
[00:16:18.705 --> 00:16:19.545]  And I'm sick of it.
[00:16:19.906 --> 00:16:21.767]  We're being strangled by these people.
[00:16:21.867 --> 00:16:24.208]  We're being suffocated by them.
[00:16:24.308 --> 00:16:28.630]  Personal debt, corporate debt, government debt is at all-time highs.
[00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:32.272]  And people will argue with you, telling you Bush is a conservative.
[00:16:32.941 --> 00:16:39.404]  When his budget is $2.6 trillion on budget and off budget another $600 plus billion.
[00:16:39.444 --> 00:16:43.406]  So that's conservatively $3.2 trillion.
[00:16:43.426 --> 00:16:45.147]  $3.2 trillion.
[00:16:46.007 --> 00:16:48.729]  And the dollar has plunged in value 40 plus percent.
[00:16:48.989 --> 00:16:50.170]  I'm not trying to be negative here.
[00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:51.270]  This is the real news.
[00:16:52.371 --> 00:16:54.612]  Even our service economy is shutting down.
[00:16:56.473 --> 00:16:57.113]  It's a nightmare.
[00:16:58.237 --> 00:17:09.320]  And their answer is accelerate globalization, expand the free trade area of the Americas, go into the Pan-American Union, drop any existing remnants of trade barriers that were protecting us.
[00:17:11.221 --> 00:17:23.905]  And it's disgusting to watch the people running this whole operation then sit up there and pontificate about how it's going to be our fault when all this happens.
[00:17:26.158 --> 00:17:27.279]  Same thing with Schwarzenegger.
[00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:28.799]  I'm just going to spend a few minutes on this.
[00:17:29.019 --> 00:17:35.742]  If you read what Schwarzenegger actually said, not just the headline yesterday, about close the borders.
[00:17:36.602 --> 00:17:37.643]  Auslanders Reich.
[00:17:39.384 --> 00:17:44.086]  He went on to say close the borders and he said we've got to pass President Bush's plan.
[00:17:45.886 --> 00:17:47.067]  His guest worker program.
[00:17:49.198 --> 00:17:57.080]  Well, now Schwarzenegger's saying he's sorry for his border comment, yesterday was a total screw-up in the words I used.
[00:17:58.661 --> 00:18:02.702]  He said his English was not good, and he did not mean close them, but secure them.
[00:18:05.143 --> 00:18:15.506]  No, what he did was try to politically position himself, because Republicans have finally found out what he is, what he's all about, and his approval ratings are plunging.
[00:18:16.026 --> 00:18:17.667]  But don't worry, they'll jack those back up.
[00:18:18.127 --> 00:18:18.947]  He's the golden boy.
[00:18:21.804 --> 00:18:23.545]  But he's doing something even more important.
[00:18:23.585 --> 00:18:25.446]  He's advised daily by Karl Rove.
[00:18:25.486 --> 00:18:31.849]  He's on the telephone, well the reports are, multiple times weekly with Karl Rove advising him on his daily activities.
[00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:33.970]  This is classic Karl Rove.
[00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:34.891]  Same thing Bush does.
[00:18:35.251 --> 00:18:36.251]  Control the borders!
[00:18:36.351 --> 00:18:37.472]  Pass my plan!
[00:18:37.792 --> 00:18:38.572]  You read the plan?
[00:18:38.632 --> 00:18:39.633]  Biggest amnesty ever.
[00:18:40.013 --> 00:18:50.018]  Total legalization of anyone here and anyone that can get here by hook or crook, by airplane, or by wading a river, or by driving across for six years.
[00:18:50.689 --> 00:18:52.711]  With an automatic extension at the end of that six.
[00:18:53.572 --> 00:18:54.753]  Total legalization!
[00:18:55.173 --> 00:19:07.725]  And it allows the Fortune 500, who's already replaced most high-tech jobs with foreign workers, brought them in, to bring even more in, but then it expands it to low-skilled workers.
[00:19:07.805 --> 00:19:09.987]  Corporations will actually fly them in!
[00:19:11.283 --> 00:19:20.448]  That'll save them a lot of money because there's already companies preparing to put cruise ships off the California coast to bring in the Indian programmers because they just can't get enough of them.
[00:19:20.468 --> 00:19:21.549]  There's only a million of them here.
[00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:28.492]  And you know, whether you live in Mexico or the U.S., you know NAPA's been bad for everybody except for these corporations.
[00:19:29.653 --> 00:19:31.814]  It's wildly unpopular in Mexico.
[00:19:31.874 --> 00:19:33.455]  It's wildly unpopular here.
[00:19:33.775 --> 00:19:34.916]  So their answer has expanded.
[00:19:35.256 --> 00:19:37.677]  So Arnold knows that people will just look at the label.
[00:19:38.217 --> 00:19:39.018]  Close the borders.
[00:19:40.419 --> 00:19:44.144]  And then his answer is, pass Bush's plan, which is total amnesty.
[00:19:45.645 --> 00:19:48.529]  There won't be an illegal alien problem, because they'll all be legal.
[00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:54.216]  See, in a weird, lawyerly, double-think way, double-speak way, it's true!
[00:19:55.677 --> 00:19:56.118]  It's true!
[00:19:56.739 --> 00:19:58.020]  There will be no more illegal aliens!
[00:19:58.401 --> 00:19:59.462]  They will fix the problem!
[00:20:01.229 --> 00:20:06.752]  We've all heard about the benefits of infrared light therapy, but never have we heard of anything as amazing as this.
[00:20:06.952 --> 00:20:14.515]  Diametics, the leading authority on polychromatic infrared diode therapy in the U.S., now offers its patented Paynex 2000 to the public.
[00:20:14.635 --> 00:20:21.238]  The Paynex 2000 uses the same technology NASA uses aboard the space shuttle, and the same technology used by the Navy SEALs.
[00:20:21.438 --> 00:20:22.799]  Now it's available to you.
[00:20:22.979 --> 00:20:29.562]  The Paynex 2000 is FDA cleared for joint aches and pains, increases circulation, and relaxes those achy muscles.
[00:20:29.782 --> 00:20:34.064]  Diametics has literally written the book on polychromatic infrared diotherapy.
[00:20:34.345 --> 00:20:40.608]  Using five different wavelengths in the Paynex 2000 has made it the most advanced infrared light therapy product on the market today.
[00:20:40.748 --> 00:20:44.770]  With over 12 different models to choose from, there's a Paynex 2000 device for everyone.

[00:21:01.269 --> 00:21:02.890]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:07.171]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:21:07.271 --> 00:21:10.152]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:21:10.232 --> 00:21:16.934]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:21:17.134 --> 00:21:20.135]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:21:20.335 --> 00:21:22.736]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:21:22.856 --> 00:21:30.738]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[00:21:30.998 --> 00:21:42.325]  Methazine, benzene, chloride and chloroform, MTBE, radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[00:21:42.485 --> 00:21:50.250]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:22:00.956 --> 00:22:04.859]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:22:05.079 --> 00:22:17.349]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:18.190]  The U.S.
[00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:23.815]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:22:24.215 --> 00:22:26.417]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:22:28.278 --> 00:22:29.340]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.223]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:22:32.323 --> 00:22:38.350]  However, shocking the economy with a reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:42.134]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.

[00:23:00.606 --> 00:23:01.746]  Why do you wear watches?
[00:23:02.046 --> 00:23:04.607]  The answer is no longer simply to tell time.
[00:23:05.087 --> 00:23:12.630]  At DiscountWatchStore.com, watches are as much about telling time as they are about making a fashion statement or showing off one's success.
[00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:16.711]  Watches also make for great heirlooms to pass on for generations to come.

[00:24:14.173 --> 00:24:15.274]  about Schwarzenegger.
[00:24:15.354 --> 00:24:17.275]  This is all done by design.
[00:24:19.637 --> 00:24:21.238]  You see Bush do it over and over again.
[00:24:21.298 --> 00:24:21.999]  Clinton would do it.
[00:24:22.059 --> 00:24:30.204]  They come out, they make a statement that then pacifies their constituency, one area of the constituency.
[00:24:30.244 --> 00:24:39.371]  They then reverse it immediately to satisfy the other side, giving people the illusion of some type of real political discourse going on.
[00:24:40.003 --> 00:24:46.368]  But then at the same time, he added the caveat of, we need to pass Bush's initiative, which is total legalization.
[00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:52.654]  Remember Bush, two State of the Unions ago, he said, this is not an amnesty!
[00:24:53.414 --> 00:24:57.538]  Oh no, it's just a total, complete, absolute legalization of everyone.
[00:24:59.359 --> 00:25:07.306]  And of course I overuse the parallel example of, we're not going to have any more murder because we're just going to legalize murder and change its name.
[00:25:08.607 --> 00:25:12.710]  But you could say, we're not going to have any more fires in the city of Chicago, ever.
[00:25:13.451 --> 00:25:14.632]  And you say, well how is that?
[00:25:14.692 --> 00:25:18.615]  Well, we're just going to rename Fire.
[00:25:19.136 --> 00:25:20.837]  We're going to call it maybe Easter Bunny.
[00:25:21.618 --> 00:25:25.000]  And then we're not going to fight fires, we're just going to ignore they're there.
[00:25:25.921 --> 00:25:29.644]  We're going to change the name of Fire to Easter Bunny and then we're just going to deny it even exists.
[00:25:29.684 --> 00:25:33.207]  I mean, it's that insane, it's that in your face, it's that
[00:25:34.255 --> 00:25:41.037]  Well, there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, we know right where they are, and then Rumsfeld says, I never said that, it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:25:41.297 --> 00:25:44.518]  I never said there were weapons of mass destruction, and the media doesn't challenge it.
[00:25:46.399 --> 00:25:49.220]  It's like saying they never used the Patriot Act against the citizens.
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.120]  And that's all they seem to do.
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:57.982]  Oh, it's just pure twisting, pure lying.
[00:25:59.803 --> 00:26:02.684]  Urgent action needed on Real ID Act.
[00:26:03.786 --> 00:26:06.767]  A tri-national ID card merging U.S.
[00:26:06.807 --> 00:26:12.810]  driver's license databases with Canada and Mexico could be passing under the banner of 9-11 today.
[00:26:13.411 --> 00:26:16.172]  And here's the urgent action alert from civilrights.org.
[00:26:17.092 --> 00:26:20.454]  Call your Senators by dialing the Congressional Switchboard at 202-224-3121.
[00:26:20.514 --> 00:26:21.394]  Senator Johnny
[00:26:25.897 --> 00:26:32.561]  Isakson, Republican Georgia has introduced the Real ID Act as an amendment to the emergency supplemental bill.
[00:26:32.601 --> 00:26:37.603]  The amendment may well come up for a vote on the Senate floor either tonight or tomorrow.
[00:26:38.103 --> 00:26:45.247]  It is also possible that amendments may be offered to improve the Real ID Act or to make it even more punitive.
[00:26:46.357 --> 00:26:53.400]  Because of the uncertainty and the shortness of time, it is imperative to call both of your Senators immediately with the following simple message.
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.042]  Oppose all provisions of the REAL ID Act.
[00:26:56.562 --> 00:26:58.423]  We'll go over some of the background of it in a few minutes.
[00:26:58.563 --> 00:27:01.284]  I've read part of the bill on air to you many times.
[00:27:01.324 --> 00:27:04.286]  We have it posted on InfoWars.com.
[00:27:04.706 --> 00:27:09.268]  Both versions, this version out of Georgia and the version out of California.
[00:27:11.347 --> 00:27:17.032]  And, for those that are confused by this, you know I say on air every day that they've passed the National ID Card.
[00:27:18.013 --> 00:27:18.553]  And they did!
[00:27:20.095 --> 00:27:21.496]  But it's like when you're being beat up.
[00:27:21.556 --> 00:27:25.960]  You know, first they knock your teeth out, then they break your nose, then they crush your head into the concrete.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.242]  They're getting us deeper down the rat hole!
[00:27:30.623 --> 00:27:38.210]  Bush, on December 26th of 2004, signed the National ID Card legislation.
[00:27:38.866 --> 00:27:42.869]  The state standardization, driver's license standardization, as it was known.
[00:27:43.329 --> 00:27:58.839]  And that took the old program of using federal funds as a carrot and a stick to force the states to adopt thumb scanning and digital photos, which Texas has been doing since 1993, by the way.
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.401]  Forty-eight states are now doing it.
[00:28:01.441 --> 00:28:03.262]  The final two are saying they're about to do it.
[00:28:05.467 --> 00:28:08.530]  And it makes it the law that the states have to do it.
[00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:18.218]  I mean, they'd already, again, 48 of them complied because they wanted federal money, federal funds that had already been taken from the states and then given back to the states with strings attached.
[00:28:19.419 --> 00:28:22.661]  But this bill they passed last year makes it the law.
[00:28:23.842 --> 00:28:24.143]  Okay.
[00:28:25.544 --> 00:28:30.488]  And that's a national ID card, federally standardized regional ID cards that are federally controlled.
[00:28:30.948 --> 00:28:31.649]  This new one,
[00:28:33.593 --> 00:28:36.854]  Oh, by the way, the last bill also was a partial amnesty bill.
[00:28:36.894 --> 00:28:41.375]  It ordered the states to accept the fake ID cards issued by governments to their citizens.
[00:28:42.975 --> 00:28:44.815]  It's like something like 70-something governments.
[00:28:44.855 --> 00:28:46.816]  It was 33, now it's 70-something.
[00:28:47.336 --> 00:28:48.976]  Issue consula matriculis.
[00:28:49.636 --> 00:28:51.037]  That's the Spanish name for them.
[00:28:51.077 --> 00:28:55.458]  It's just a card where your government issues you a visa to that person's country.
[00:28:55.698 --> 00:28:58.078]  No, the country has to issue a visa.
[00:28:58.498 --> 00:29:01.299]  America, the United States issues you a visa.
[00:29:03.166 --> 00:29:06.408]  Your country doesn't issue you a endless visa.
[00:29:06.428 --> 00:29:11.491]  It's a blank check visa, basically, saying you're legal in America, in the United States.
[00:29:11.831 --> 00:29:20.456]  And then so from Poland, or Russia, or China, or Mexico, or Venezuela, predominantly Mexico, that's who we're always talking about, that's the majority, they come here and do this.
[00:29:23.238 --> 00:29:24.619]  So that was in the last bill.
[00:29:25.819 --> 00:29:26.680]  In this new bill,
[00:29:28.559 --> 00:29:29.700]  I'll tell you about it when we get back.
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.222]  It's the normal bait-and-switch, double-speak, double-think.
[00:29:33.782 --> 00:29:34.903]  It's the same stuff.
[00:29:36.143 --> 00:29:37.624]  And I'll go over some of the provisions of it.
[00:29:40.326 --> 00:29:42.087]  And I'm gonna get somebody on from Ron Paul's office.
[00:29:42.107 --> 00:29:43.787]  They've got the Congressman today or tomorrow.
[00:29:44.988 --> 00:29:45.669]  Talk about it more.
[00:29:46.189 --> 00:29:47.449]  But I'll tell you about it when we get back.
[00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:48.130]  And then your calls.
[00:29:51.734 --> 00:29:54.744]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.667 --> 00:29:58.356]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.454 --> 00:30:09.097]  If you're $10,000 in credit card debt or more and are making minimum monthly payments but getting nowhere, Debt Relief USA has the answer.
[00:30:09.237 --> 00:30:12.719]  Call 1-800-516-6567 now.
[00:30:12.859 --> 00:30:16.820]  Debt Relief USA has ways through special programs to reduce your principal and interest.
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:19.641]  You may qualify to reduce your credit card debt as much as 75%.
[00:30:19.681 --> 00:30:21.522]  Just call 1-800-516-6567 for a risk-free debt analysis.
[00:30:26.144 --> 00:30:29.126]  Stop losing sleep over annoying, harassing phone calls.
[00:30:29.366 --> 00:30:32.408]  Don't even consider bankruptcy until you know your options.
[00:30:32.688 --> 00:30:37.470]  We cannot help unless you call 1-800-516-6567 today.
[00:30:37.711 --> 00:30:42.073]  Our debt relief specialists understand and know the answer to getting you out of credit card debt fast.
[00:30:42.373 --> 00:30:44.534]  Just one call will put your life back on track.
[00:30:44.754 --> 00:30:53.699]  If you're $10,000 or more in credit card debt, call for a free debt evaluation at 1-800-516-6567 for the relief you need.
[00:30:53.939 --> 00:30:59.161]  Debt Relief USA is helping Americans re-secure their financial future one client at a time.
[00:30:59.361 --> 00:31:00.742]  Excluding Maryland and New York.
[00:31:01.142 --> 00:31:04.163]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:31:04.463 --> 00:31:09.405]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:09.645 --> 00:31:14.006]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.306 --> 00:31:23.209]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:23.409 --> 00:31:27.030]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:32.373]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:32.654 --> 00:31:39.398]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:31:39.878 --> 00:31:40.419]  What about you?
[00:31:41.178 --> 00:31:46.080]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:46.521]  A $14 savings.
[00:31:46.581 --> 00:31:47.741]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:31:47.761 --> 00:31:49.642]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:32:01.019 --> 00:32:03.361]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:32:03.621 --> 00:32:07.465]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:32:07.785 --> 00:32:08.606]  Read the labels.
[00:32:09.026 --> 00:32:13.150]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:17.553]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:32:17.954 --> 00:32:22.818]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:32:23.198 --> 00:32:26.780]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:32.303]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:32:32.583 --> 00:32:35.304]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:32:35.605 --> 00:32:36.505]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:32:36.805 --> 00:32:47.531]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.
[00:32:47.911 --> 00:32:53.012]  Call Cal-Ben toll-free at 1-800-340-7091.
[00:32:53.032 --> 00:32:57.873]  That's 800-340-7091 or visit calbenpuresoap.com.
[00:33:04.114 --> 00:33:10.155]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:33:10.755 --> 00:33:13.716]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:16.366 --> 00:33:18.827]  Alright, Jimmy Vaughn coming up in the next hour.
[00:33:20.088 --> 00:33:22.329]  Talking about the toll roads and how he's fighting it.
[00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:30.012]  You really got to admire all the self-sacrifices going on here in Texas to defend the rest of the country from the toll roads.
[00:33:30.392 --> 00:33:33.794]  We also have Sal Costello heading up the fight on with us.
[00:33:33.834 --> 00:33:36.595]  The head of AustinTollParty.com with us.
[00:33:37.355 --> 00:33:39.696]  I know we got loaded phone lines since this broadcast began.
[00:33:39.717 --> 00:33:41.317]  We're going to be going to your calls here in a few minutes.
[00:33:41.397 --> 00:33:44.579]  David and Tim and Ralph and Dave and Regina and many, many others.
[00:33:46.641 --> 00:33:49.102]  Continuing with the Real ID Act.
[00:33:50.343 --> 00:33:51.463]  See, they're building on it.
[00:33:51.483 --> 00:33:53.044]  They're always making it worse.
[00:33:55.886 --> 00:33:58.207]  And, of course, they spin it.
[00:33:59.848 --> 00:34:01.809]  And Ron Paul's even written news articles about this.
[00:34:01.829 --> 00:34:06.291]  You know, Immigration Trojan Horse Bill really is National ID Card Expansion.
[00:34:07.011 --> 00:34:08.572]  That was the headline a few months ago.
[00:34:08.652 --> 00:34:10.133]  They're fighting to pass this.
[00:34:10.193 --> 00:34:12.254]  We've fought them off several times.
[00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:20.315]  And it actually gives much of the expanded amnesty that Bush wants to the illegal aliens!
[00:34:20.935 --> 00:34:26.259]  And I've heard it pushed by neocon liars on talk radio as an immigration bill.
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.121]  I'll tell you, they're slick, folks.
[00:34:29.141 --> 00:34:33.884]  I mean, they count on a population that just doesn't check out the text of what they're doing.
[00:34:35.345 --> 00:34:36.066]  It's disgusting.
[00:34:38.127 --> 00:34:39.568]  And here's some of the backgrounds.
[00:34:39.608 --> 00:34:42.628]  The REAL ID Act includes the following provisions.
[00:34:42.729 --> 00:34:58.313]  It repeals 9-11 intelligence bills, responsible national driver's license standards, and replaces them with rigid new ones, including prohibiting states from providing driver's license to undocumented immigrants.
[00:34:59.194 --> 00:35:01.234]  Now again, this is a liberal group I'm reading this from.
[00:35:02.195 --> 00:35:06.256]  Repeal 9-11 intelligence bill, responsible national driver's license standards,
[00:35:07.259 --> 00:35:08.620]  Those were not responsible.
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:15.022]  Replaces them with rigid new ones, including prohibiting states from providing driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants.
[00:35:16.322 --> 00:35:17.303]  Well, that's not true.
[00:35:17.323 --> 00:35:21.404]  In the bill, it issues them to the illegals, and then says that they're documented.
[00:35:23.945 --> 00:35:25.626]  So this is interesting.
[00:35:25.706 --> 00:35:30.288]  Makes asylum even harder to prove, so that more victims will be sent back to repressive regimes.
[00:35:30.328 --> 00:35:33.089]  Imposes guilt by association on immigrants.
[00:35:33.549 --> 00:35:36.870]  Prevents courts from reviewing many erroneous immigration decisions.
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:43.583]  Waves all laws along both land borders to clear construction for fences and barriers.
[00:35:43.643 --> 00:35:44.864]  Okay, I want to stop right here.
[00:35:45.924 --> 00:35:58.430]  As Paul Watson posted this, we post a lot of alternative news, what we need to do is post comments from Ron Paul's analysis of this, repost it on the main page, and post links to his analysis of it.
[00:35:59.691 --> 00:36:07.255]  Because Total911info normally does a pretty good job of analyzing legislation, but what they did here was link
[00:36:08.656 --> 00:36:12.599]  to one of these more liberal groups.
[00:36:12.999 --> 00:36:20.866]  Now again, the liberal groups are opposing this too, which is good, but they're opposing it for different reasons than what you call conservative groups.
[00:36:20.926 --> 00:36:26.090]  And now, I hadn't read all this article, I started reading their analysis, and it's patently false.
[00:36:27.191 --> 00:36:28.912]  But hey, if it gets liberals to call and...
[00:36:30.242 --> 00:36:32.043]  And tell Congress not to pass it.
[00:36:32.484 --> 00:36:32.884]  Whatever.
[00:36:33.164 --> 00:36:35.126]  But see, that shows how this fools people.
[00:36:35.206 --> 00:36:40.790]  This talk of stopping immigration has got the left out there fighting it when it'll actually give them what they want.
[00:36:42.511 --> 00:36:48.876]  It's like the left screamed bloody murder yesterday when Schwarzenegger said, close the borders, and they didn't finish his sentence.
[00:36:49.456 --> 00:36:53.840]  Pass Bush's guest worker program, which is total legalization.
[00:36:55.161 --> 00:36:56.542]  Man, wheels within wheels.
[00:36:58.115 --> 00:37:11.100]  So I think what we need to do is take this analysis down and we need to link to the old analysis of Ron Paul and the good analysis of Total911info.
[00:37:11.941 --> 00:37:14.342]  So see here's a learning experience for us right here.
[00:37:14.842 --> 00:37:19.524]  I start reading into their analysis of this and it doesn't even have really what's in the bill.
[00:37:22.768 --> 00:37:23.228]  Amazing.
[00:37:23.748 --> 00:37:24.848]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:37:25.689 --> 00:37:27.089]  Some of the other news that's coming up.
[00:37:27.129 --> 00:37:28.749]  Helicopters shot down over Iraq.
[00:37:28.809 --> 00:37:29.389]  Nine dead.
[00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:34.290]  Pre-release pirates could receive jail time.
[00:37:35.751 --> 00:37:39.332]  Passenger lists sought for flights over the United States.
[00:37:42.352 --> 00:37:44.973]  Law bans open food, drinks, and vehicles.
[00:37:45.173 --> 00:37:46.873]  Any food or drinks in vehicles.
[00:37:48.193 --> 00:37:50.614]  But there's a twist there that we'll tell you about.
[00:37:51.314 --> 00:37:57.076]  Another headline here, thimerosal react differently in the brains of infants.
[00:37:57.156 --> 00:37:59.577]  It's even worse in the brains of infants.
[00:38:00.477 --> 00:38:02.498]  There's also been a lot of resignations.
[00:38:03.158 --> 00:38:17.383]  The Italian Prime Minister has resigned because his approval rating dropped so low and their Parliament did very badly when they had been one of the longest sitting governments since Mussolini.
[00:38:17.403 --> 00:38:20.864]  Normally an Italian government lasts about eight months is the average.
[00:38:21.471 --> 00:38:24.293]  He's been in there for years, the fascist, Bersaloni.
[00:38:25.434 --> 00:38:29.877]  And he's had to resign now because people are mad that he lied about weapons of mass destruction.
[00:38:31.218 --> 00:38:35.842]  The number three man in the Blair government has resigned.
[00:38:37.363 --> 00:38:43.628]  And now it's being reported that Secretary of Defense Rummy will be leaving sometime this summer.
[00:38:44.168 --> 00:38:48.952]  But he just got back from Tajikistan and some of the other areas in Central Asia.
[00:38:51.209 --> 00:38:55.090]  And they are talking now about invading, attacking Iran.
[00:38:55.110 --> 00:39:02.512]  Of course, the globalists will have to have a fortuitous terrorist attack first before they're able to do that.
[00:39:02.793 --> 00:39:03.593]  But let's go to your calls.
[00:39:03.613 --> 00:39:04.813]  I'm going to move quickly through your calls.
[00:39:04.833 --> 00:39:06.254]  I'm going to try.
[00:39:06.334 --> 00:39:07.614]  David Mass, you're on the air.
[00:39:07.654 --> 00:39:08.034]  Go ahead.
[00:39:08.674 --> 00:39:09.535]  Alex, how are you today?
[00:39:09.855 --> 00:39:10.135]  Good.
[00:39:11.775 --> 00:39:17.917]  The Florida House of Representatives just passed Jessica Lunsford Act, and that's HB 1877.
[00:39:21.144 --> 00:39:29.415]  And what that is, is that people convicted of molesting a child, the sentences have increased from 25 years to life.
[00:39:30.256 --> 00:39:38.927]  But, if you serve less than a life sentence, you will be released and you will be tracked with a global positioning system for the rest of your life.
[00:39:39.545 --> 00:39:40.686]  And this is how it works.
[00:39:41.046 --> 00:39:55.576]  They take some group that we all hate, that is the scum of the earth, and I didn't see that by the way, and they set the precedent that when we put you on parole, for life, you have a satellite tracker.
[00:39:55.796 --> 00:40:05.503]  Now, when it's, then it'll be bank robbery, then it'll be car theft, then it'll be family violence, then it'll be, it'll be everything.
[00:40:06.264 --> 00:40:07.384]  Alex, it'll be everything.
[00:40:07.404 --> 00:40:15.307]  It's like, if you don't take the chip, it's going to advance from the global positioning systems, the ankle bracelets and everything they have now, to the chip.
[00:40:15.387 --> 00:40:20.569]  Well, they're already coming out with small chips that are satellite-tracked, and people ask, how do they boost to the satellite?
[00:40:20.589 --> 00:40:22.730]  So they boost through cell towers.
[00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:28.632]  Just like your cell phone, a tiny chip in your cell phone triangulates off the cell towers and then gives down to 15 feet.
[00:40:29.864 --> 00:40:31.166]  That's federal law, 15 feet.
[00:40:31.207 --> 00:40:34.732]  I've talked to engineers, it's actually down to about 3, your exact location.
[00:40:35.153 --> 00:40:43.748]  And so, Applied Digital last year bought a company involved in the satellite triangulation, 3 cell towers, to do just that.
[00:40:44.401 --> 00:40:47.242]  And if you don't take it, of course, they'll demonize everybody.
[00:40:47.282 --> 00:40:55.946]  Like you say, they'll start with child molesters, then it'll be somebody for simply a six-month charge of having, like, maybe an eighth of an ounce of marijuana.
[00:40:55.986 --> 00:40:58.067]  Well, I'm sorry, you'll have to be tracked for the rest of your life.
[00:40:58.287 --> 00:41:01.249]  They're already doing that, but they say you'll be tracked for two years.
[00:41:01.889 --> 00:41:04.630]  They're already doing that with drunk drivers and other people, yeah.
[00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:08.412]  And then it'll be forever, and then if you don't do it, well, I guess you're with Al-Qaeda.
[00:41:09.835 --> 00:41:10.676]  No, I agree with you.
[00:41:10.736 --> 00:41:11.897]  That's the plan.
[00:41:11.917 --> 00:41:15.059]  Look, I said a long time ago, they're going to start with Alzheimer patients.
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:16.841]  They're going to start with children.
[00:41:16.861 --> 00:41:18.022]  They're going to start with child molesters.
[00:41:18.042 --> 00:41:23.106]  They're going to start with people that can't defend themselves or people that are degenerate scum.
[00:41:23.446 --> 00:41:26.509]  People that society either hate or don't care about.
[00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:28.431]  And now look at it.
[00:41:28.471 --> 00:41:31.353]  I mean, you want to work in the Mexican Attorney General's office?
[00:41:31.373 --> 00:41:32.174]  You've got to have a chip.
[00:41:32.934 --> 00:41:34.455]  You want to get into the VIP section?
[00:41:34.475 --> 00:41:35.696]  You've got to have a chip at the bar.
[00:41:35.956 --> 00:41:39.078]  You want to be one of their go-go dancers at Baja Beach Club?
[00:41:39.098 --> 00:41:39.978]  You've got to have a chip.
[00:41:40.078 --> 00:41:42.159]  It's all ready happening.
[00:41:42.539 --> 00:41:44.681]  They'll just normalize it through Hollywood.
[00:41:44.701 --> 00:41:48.603]  Well, that's what this IBM exec was saying all over the newspapers the last week.
[00:41:48.983 --> 00:41:50.924]  He's out there promoting it and being given all this attention.
[00:41:50.944 --> 00:41:56.227]  He says, oh yeah, we're going to be old squares and kooks because we don't want the chip.
[00:41:57.458 --> 00:41:58.779]  And again, I'm not tootin' my horn.
[00:41:58.799 --> 00:41:59.820]  I know how they operate.
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:03.142]  How many times have I said they're gonna pitch it through the fads?
[00:42:03.242 --> 00:42:04.943]  It's cool to have a chip.
[00:42:06.464 --> 00:42:06.944]  Absolutely.
[00:42:07.444 --> 00:42:09.105]  You're just backward, David.
[00:42:09.125 --> 00:42:10.026]  You need a chip.
[00:42:10.046 --> 00:42:10.626]  Well, of course.
[00:42:10.946 --> 00:42:11.787]  I'm with Al-Qaeda.
[00:42:12.307 --> 00:42:14.849]  Well, either you're backward or you're with Al-Qaeda, yes.
[00:42:15.869 --> 00:42:16.730]  Thanks for the call, David.
[00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:17.790]  Good to hear from you.
[00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:19.892]  Yes, that's, uh, sounds good.
[00:42:20.872 --> 00:42:25.015]  Make these scum, uh, spend life in prison.
[00:42:25.135 --> 00:42:25.415]  Oh, but
[00:42:26.488 --> 00:42:27.488]  There's a little wrinkle.
[00:42:27.568 --> 00:42:28.729]  We'll let you out of prison.
[00:42:28.749 --> 00:42:33.030]  You just gotta take a bracelet, an ankle bracelet, for the rest of your life.
[00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:35.750]  And then it'll expand out from there.
[00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:37.611]  Tim in Nebraska.
[00:42:37.651 --> 00:42:38.331]  Tim, go ahead.
[00:42:38.831 --> 00:42:44.072]  Yeah, Alex, I was flying down there this morning to go to the concert tonight.
[00:42:44.733 --> 00:42:54.755]  But because of some snowstorm or hailstorm in Denver, my plane got delayed this morning and they wouldn't reroute me to another carrier because of using frequent flyer miles.
[00:42:55.578 --> 00:42:58.379]  So I thought I'd tell people they might go to the hotel tonight.
[00:42:58.419 --> 00:43:01.040]  There might be a couple free tickets at the window down there.
[00:43:02.281 --> 00:43:04.302]  Well, that's incredibly nice of you, Tim.
[00:43:04.322 --> 00:43:15.346]  You were going to come all the way down to Central Texas to see Jimmy Vaughn and company there at the Doubletree North and now you can't go because of that nasty snowstorm.
[00:43:15.866 --> 00:43:16.126]  Yeah.
[00:43:16.887 --> 00:43:18.427]  You think you were bummed yesterday.
[00:43:19.628 --> 00:43:20.328]  You know what it was?
[00:43:21.208 --> 00:43:22.909]  Again, I'm not used to getting sick.
[00:43:24.369 --> 00:43:39.717]  And so, my allergies get worse every year, and so whenever I start having an allergy attack, I feel really bummed out at first, I feel really depressed, I don't know what it is, and then my nose starts running, I start coughing, and then I take some medication and it goes away.
[00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:43.092]  So, I was having an allergy attack yesterday.
[00:43:43.472 --> 00:43:43.872]  I see.
[00:43:44.212 --> 00:43:45.893]  Yeah, well, I mean, you want to see my car.
[00:43:46.474 --> 00:43:50.716]  Every day when I go out to it, it's covered in about a centimeter of oak pollen.
[00:43:51.497 --> 00:43:54.299]  And man, that stuff just, just hammers you off.
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:58.281]  Well, give us a good rundown on what happens tomorrow.
[00:43:59.962 --> 00:44:00.282]  I will.
[00:44:00.322 --> 00:44:03.725]  Well, I'm gonna, you know, I'm so busy I haven't even gotten a camera person yet.
[00:44:05.242 --> 00:44:14.045]  But I've got to get home and charge some video cameras and stuff because I want to put a little bit of a concert on a local cable show and on the website and some of the speeches.
[00:44:14.686 --> 00:44:20.268]  But I'll get some cameras charged and locked and loaded and ready and I'll try to put that on the web for free.
[00:44:20.328 --> 00:44:22.689]  I'll say another aside if you've got a second.
[00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:31.152]  I was the one that called in last week about my kids being in trouble and I thank you for giving that long exposé.
[00:44:33.823 --> 00:44:42.625]  I don't know if this had anything to do with it or not, but my youngest son last week told me that they were speaking about the Nazis in his history class.
[00:44:43.926 --> 00:44:52.488]  And he got up in front of the whole class and started going on about the Nazi death toll and killing bones and this and that.
[00:44:53.288 --> 00:44:55.168]  He got the whole school talking about it.
[00:44:55.669 --> 00:44:57.769]  He had kids coming up to him.
[00:44:57.809 --> 00:45:01.450]  He's even been taking some tapes to school for some kids that were interested.
[00:45:03.306 --> 00:45:03.606]  See?
[00:45:04.007 --> 00:45:08.991]  He exposed the Bushes for being in a Nazi death cult, and he'll end up being one of the most popular people in school.
[00:45:09.391 --> 00:45:15.756]  Not for acting like an idiot with his pants hanging down around his ankles, but for talking about real politics.
[00:45:16.157 --> 00:45:18.699]  He'll soon be beating the women off with a stick.
[00:45:18.799 --> 00:45:19.639]  Good to hear from you, Tim.
[00:45:19.779 --> 00:45:20.240]  All right, thanks.
[00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:21.261]  All right, good to hear from you.
[00:45:21.521 --> 00:45:24.103]  Let's talk to Ralph in New York.
[00:45:24.163 --> 00:45:24.884]  Ralph, go ahead.
[00:45:25.024 --> 00:45:25.844]  Hey, what's happening, Alex?
[00:45:25.864 --> 00:45:26.325]  How you doing?
[00:45:26.365 --> 00:45:26.845]  What's happening?
[00:45:26.865 --> 00:45:31.109]  Just want to say, uh, on your tape of Martial Law, man, it's an awesome tape.
[00:45:31.129 --> 00:45:32.630]  It's an awesome documentary you got.
[00:45:33.633 --> 00:45:38.200]  And, uh, we show it to a live lecture in, uh, at the school auditorium here in New York City.
[00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:40.123]  I mean, in Harlem, New York.
[00:45:40.904 --> 00:45:43.728]  And, uh, a lot of people are starting to wake up to your new documentary.
[00:45:44.674 --> 00:45:45.535]  Well, thank you.
[00:45:45.555 --> 00:45:46.455]  Where did you show it?
[00:45:46.556 --> 00:45:47.897]  Where did you show it in New York?
[00:45:47.997 --> 00:45:49.638]  We showed it at a high school.
[00:45:49.918 --> 00:45:54.081]  Basically, we had Dick Gregory, the activist, the speaker.
[00:45:54.101 --> 00:45:55.422]  Yeah, he knows all about 9-11.
[00:45:55.582 --> 00:46:06.971]  And basically, he was up there, and we had a lot of old school musicians from the 60s and 70s, like the OJs, the Temptations, and we had a couple of guest speakers.
[00:46:06.991 --> 00:46:09.973]  They were very shocked what they saw.
[00:46:10.613 --> 00:46:13.656]  And a lot of our people, especially in the black community, they don't know what's going on.
[00:46:14.457 --> 00:46:34.865]  Because we actually had to show it to actual speakers to put in your documentary on your video and we basically, they were really breaking it in because a lot of us in the black community are very blind, not seeing the reality of what's going on out here.
[00:46:35.386 --> 00:46:40.988]  So you're saying there was an event at your school and the film was shown there?
[00:46:41.618 --> 00:47:03.164]  Well, I actually asked permission to one of the persons, he was the actual speaker, and he rented out the whole place, and we actually asked one of the brothers there if we could show the video, and they said yeah, so we showed it, and a lot of guests came in, Dick Gregory came in, and he spoke after he spoke,
[00:47:03.957 --> 00:47:11.642]  And at the podium we showed the video and people were in shock, especially a lot of the young cats in the hip-hop generation don't know what's going on.
[00:47:12.223 --> 00:47:17.726]  And they know that this is going to hit the fan very soon and it's a wake-up call, you know what I'm saying?
[00:47:17.786 --> 00:47:19.648]  And we're aware about you.
[00:47:20.248 --> 00:47:23.850]  And they'll say, man, Alex Jones, he's a lion, man.
[00:47:24.031 --> 00:47:25.271]  The man's out there doing the work.
[00:47:26.846 --> 00:47:29.667]  A lot of us don't know what's going on in the black community.
[00:47:29.887 --> 00:47:34.368]  We have to wake up people up because a lot of us are blind with the system.
[00:47:34.608 --> 00:47:35.708]  They don't know about the new world order.
[00:47:35.728 --> 00:47:37.668]  They don't know about what's going to come down very soon.
[00:47:38.588 --> 00:47:40.289]  It's a major wake up call.
[00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:44.230]  A major wake up call, especially in the black community.
[00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:48.851]  Ralph, because of people like you, we're going to win this fight.
[00:47:49.231 --> 00:47:53.272]  Because of folks at your school taking action.
[00:47:53.292 --> 00:47:55.272]  Dick Gregory, one of the biggest civil rights activists,
[00:47:55.902 --> 00:47:56.904]  In U.S.
[00:47:58.047 --> 00:48:02.355]  history, he's now traveling the country exposing 9-11.
[00:48:03.137 --> 00:48:05.662]  If you guys take action, we can save this country.
[00:48:06.269 --> 00:48:21.915]  Right, and we have a lot of members also from the 60s, like the Black Panthers and people that spoke, and also they talked about the Muhammad Ali incident, the Vietnam War, and it basically broke down because they know that when the draft comes back, it's not going to be like it was in the era of Muhammad Ali back in the 60s.
[00:48:22.315 --> 00:48:26.937]  It's going to be the young generation now that's going to have no choice but to revoke the system.
[00:48:27.217 --> 00:48:35.300]  And it's going to be some sort of anarchy, and basically I know that a lot of us in our communities are going to be targeted, especially minorities.
[00:48:37.727 --> 00:48:41.518]  They're going to pull up with big old trucks like they always do and just grab you!
[00:48:42.505 --> 00:48:43.885]  It's the old press gangs.
[00:48:44.286 --> 00:48:44.886]  Right, right.
[00:48:44.906 --> 00:48:50.367]  They're saying it's some sort of anarchy, some sort of a race war, getting ready to break out, because they're the additional class.
[00:48:50.587 --> 00:48:54.888]  They're not going to talk to the rich, like people like Donald Trump's sons, or the Rockefellers.
[00:48:55.028 --> 00:48:58.409]  No, they're going to talk to guys like us, who have nothing going for us.
[00:48:58.689 --> 00:49:01.750]  Because their CEO, this is about to hit the fan very soon.
[00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:02.550]  I hear you.
[00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:06.471]  Listen, Ralph, I want to commend you for what you're doing and take care of my friend.
[00:49:06.491 --> 00:49:07.451]  That's very exciting.
[00:49:08.031 --> 00:49:10.112]  Yeah, martial law has only been out for
[00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:17.131]  For about a month and a half, and it's already sending shockwaves across the country.
[00:49:18.112 --> 00:49:23.773]  And it will have no effect unless you get it, unless you make ten copies and pass it on.
[00:49:25.233 --> 00:49:27.274]  Unless you show it at your college and your school.
[00:49:27.774 --> 00:49:30.915]  Look, the last two calls were people in school exposing this.
[00:49:31.335 --> 00:49:32.175]  Let's take another one.
[00:49:33.255 --> 00:49:34.996]  Dave in Michigan.
[00:49:35.016 --> 00:49:35.716]  Go ahead, Dave.
[00:49:36.471 --> 00:49:38.373]  Hey Alex, just returning the call.
[00:49:38.393 --> 00:49:40.495]  He asked me to give you a call back at the close of yesterday's show.
[00:49:40.515 --> 00:49:40.775]  That's right.
[00:49:40.795 --> 00:49:45.179]  You called at the very end of the broadcast talking about the Phil Marshall Law and you had a question.
[00:49:45.239 --> 00:49:46.220]  Restate that question.
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:47.661]  Okay.
[00:49:47.701 --> 00:49:49.262]  The question has a follow-up question.
[00:49:49.322 --> 00:50:02.434]  First, I had brought up the scene where you described that the so-called hijackers got on board the planes and then gas was released to subdue everybody and then the planes were remote controlled into their target.
[00:50:03.351 --> 00:50:12.414]  Okay, and you explained that you could go two more hours on 9-11 if you could actually expose all the information that you actually have in your possession.
[00:50:12.874 --> 00:50:27.038]  Well, my actual question is that because it's kind of confusing that there is also evidence on your website, especially PrisonPlanet.tv, that in my mind pretty much proves that it wasn't actually the flight that hit the Pentagon, it was something else.
[00:50:27.811 --> 00:50:33.934]  And then there's also evidence that I've seen that raises doubt that it was actually the commercial flight that hit the South Tower.
[00:50:34.454 --> 00:50:37.055]  So, how does that deal with what you're saying?
[00:50:37.095 --> 00:50:39.096]  Stay there, let me try to answer that on the other side.
[00:50:40.416 --> 00:50:42.017]  Let me be clear about this right now.
[00:50:42.697 --> 00:50:45.158]  Everything you see on my website, I don't agree with.
[00:50:45.878 --> 00:50:51.941]  Like earlier I was reading this leftist analysis of this National ID Card Bill.
[00:50:53.101 --> 00:50:55.062]  Everything you see on my site, I don't agree with.
[00:50:56.027 --> 00:50:56.547]  Number one.
[00:50:57.047 --> 00:50:58.527]  I'll answer the rest of the question when we get back.
[00:51:01.368 --> 00:51:08.229]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.529 --> 00:51:09.909]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:10.089 --> 00:51:12.310]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:12.450 --> 00:51:14.550]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:14.810 --> 00:51:19.731]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:20.091 --> 00:51:24.132]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:24.372 --> 00:51:26.133]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:51:26.213 --> 00:51:36.880]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:38.922]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:51:39.122 --> 00:51:41.183]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today.
[00:51:41.423 --> 00:51:42.944]  And man the guns of the Infowars.
[00:51:43.084 --> 00:51:44.505]  Order right now by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:44.545 --> 00:51:44.765]  That's 888-253-3139.

[00:52:01.292 --> 00:52:04.295]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:52:04.655 --> 00:52:13.462]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:52:13.802 --> 00:52:18.466]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:18.946 --> 00:52:25.649]  The Berkey Light is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:52:26.049 --> 00:52:37.855]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:38.315 --> 00:52:42.778]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:52:42.938 --> 00:52:45.400]  Get the Murky Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:54:06.207 --> 00:54:08.128]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:54:08.589 --> 00:54:11.411]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:13.432 --> 00:54:16.914]  I'll tell you what I'm going to do today in Michigan.
[00:54:16.934 --> 00:54:21.757]  I'm going to try to answer your question quickly right now and I'll spend about 20 minutes on it.
[00:54:23.739 --> 00:54:26.020]  Because it's important to do this in the third hour.
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:32.384]  We've got Jimmy Vaughn and Sal Costello coming on for about 30 minutes in the next hour.
[00:54:32.404 --> 00:54:34.606]  We'll continue with your calls and news as well.
[00:54:37.496 --> 00:54:42.962]  Dave, first off, a lot of the sponsors you hear on this radio network, I don't agree with.
[00:54:43.482 --> 00:54:48.567]  If you don't hear my voice endorsing it, it doesn't necessarily mean I support it.
[00:54:49.208 --> 00:54:52.952]  If you hear other people on this network, I don't necessarily agree with what they're saying.
[00:54:53.012 --> 00:54:57.997]  If you read any stuff on my website, and when I post the New York Times saying something, it doesn't mean I agree with what they're saying.
[00:54:58.017 --> 00:55:00.079]  A lot of times we'll put a comment on it.
[00:55:01.505 --> 00:55:10.370]  I cover with 9-11 what I can prove, and the only area people can say, well, it's not totally proven, is that, you know, they released a gas and they killed everybody and remote controlled it.
[00:55:11.810 --> 00:55:22.056]  I do have the evidence of that, and I can go over that, it'll just take some time, but we know, again, there's hundreds of points here, that their houses, their cars, their credit cards were paid for by the U.S.
[00:55:22.096 --> 00:55:22.416]  government.
[00:55:23.196 --> 00:55:23.837]  The hijackers.
[00:55:24.937 --> 00:55:27.258]  We know that they were trained at U.S.
[00:55:27.298 --> 00:55:28.119]  military bases.
[00:55:29.105 --> 00:55:33.127]  We know that General Mahmoud Ahmed, who was CIA, gave Mohammed Abed $100,000.
[00:55:33.227 --> 00:55:41.952]  We know they ordered embassies to let them back into the country when they go to Al-Qaeda summits in Malaysia and say, it's national security, it's for training.
[00:55:42.733 --> 00:55:49.937]  We know they're on planes with people like James Woods, a week before, openly acting like they're going to hijack the plane.
[00:55:51.098 --> 00:55:58.282]  He gets off and tells the police at a Phoenix Connection and they go, look, you'll be arrested if you talk about this, it's national security.
[00:55:59.019 --> 00:56:04.241]  So we know they were government agents, we know they were being protected, and there's a hundred other pieces of evidence just on that.
[00:56:04.801 --> 00:56:11.124]  We know the planes all had exactly 20% occupancy on a day when the planes were all over 80% occupancy.
[00:56:11.144 --> 00:56:13.244]  A computer malfunction at United and American.
[00:56:14.525 --> 00:56:20.307]  We know that there were three phone calls made to people from cell phones that wouldn't even work on board the planes.
[00:56:20.687 --> 00:56:22.488]  I know people who worked, who heard the calls.
[00:56:23.228 --> 00:56:30.314]  We heard some of the tapes that have been shredded, where stewardesses were saying, help us, we can't breathe, there's something in the air.
[00:56:31.335 --> 00:56:36.559]  We have that, I have that from other government sources, sources that even told me about the attacks before they happened.
[00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:43.525]  Some sources I can't list, but that's basically what happened with those aircraft.
[00:56:44.206 --> 00:56:44.606]  Okay.
[00:56:45.207 --> 00:56:47.889]  But I mean, again, I'll spend 20 minutes on it in the third hour.
[00:56:48.414 --> 00:56:48.874]  I gotcha.
[00:56:48.914 --> 00:56:50.415]  I'll slowly try to go over it.
[00:56:50.755 --> 00:56:57.357]  If you could, at the same time, to address the absence of any fuselage or other evidence of a plane crashing into the Pentagon.
[00:56:58.278 --> 00:56:58.918]  I understand that.
[00:56:58.958 --> 00:57:00.419]  I'm talking about Tower 1 and 2.
[00:57:00.859 --> 00:57:01.219]  Okay.
[00:57:01.339 --> 00:57:01.619]  Okay.
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:03.280]  Alright.
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:06.461]  I mean, the film's already three hours long, and I'm...
[00:57:07.361 --> 00:57:12.124]  Quite frankly, there may be another edition in six months, a year, where there's an extra hour, perhaps.
[00:57:12.164 --> 00:57:14.105]  It'll be a two-disc set or something.
[00:57:14.185 --> 00:57:17.787]  I mean, really, I should make an hour-long film and try to cram it all into there.
[00:57:17.807 --> 00:57:19.408]  The problem is, there's just so much evidence.
[00:57:21.189 --> 00:57:23.770]  Listen, I appreciate your call, Dave, and tune in during the third hour.
[00:57:23.790 --> 00:57:24.771]  I'll try to answer your question.
[00:57:25.151 --> 00:57:25.651]  Will do, Alex.
[00:57:25.731 --> 00:57:26.272]  Thank you very much.
[00:57:26.412 --> 00:57:26.672]  Thank you.
[00:57:26.692 --> 00:57:28.913]  I'll try to do a better job, that is, because I'm just out of time.
[00:57:29.333 --> 00:57:33.796]  On the last minute of this hour, you've heard a lot about Martial Law, my new film.
[00:57:35.314 --> 00:57:36.796]  And it's my best work.
[00:57:36.996 --> 00:57:37.816]  I want you to have it.
[00:57:37.836 --> 00:57:37.816]  $25.95.
[00:57:37.857 --> 00:57:40.079]  There's only three films in one.
[00:57:40.439 --> 00:57:42.040]  Get a second copy for $19.95.
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:43.241]  Another copy for even less.
[00:57:43.902 --> 00:57:47.445]  You can get them for as low as like $14 if you order a bunch of them.
[00:57:48.446 --> 00:57:50.028]  Please get Martial Law.
[00:57:50.128 --> 00:57:51.969]  Please get one copy and make copies.

[00:58:31.942 --> 00:58:33.962]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the place to do all that.

[00:58:57.825 --> 00:58:58.485]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.126 --> 00:59:00.206]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.906 --> 00:59:02.006]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.646 --> 00:59:03.487]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.227 --> 00:59:05.127]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.147 --> 00:59:09.468]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.968 --> 00:59:14.049]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:25.536 --> 00:59:28.257]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm fired up!
[00:59:28.477 --> 00:59:35.141]  We are now into hour number two of this Thursday, the 21st day of April 2005 edition.
[00:59:35.621 --> 00:59:37.021]  This is Real Talk Radio.
[00:59:37.442 --> 00:59:41.243]  Real issues of significance that actually affect you and your family.
[00:59:41.303 --> 00:59:45.545]  I'm here Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 central, back from 9 to midnight.
[00:59:46.106 --> 00:59:48.947]  Coming up in about five, six minutes, we're going to have Jimmy Vaughn on with us.
[00:59:49.907 --> 00:59:51.108]  The Grammy Award winning
[00:59:51.895 --> 00:59:53.856]  A musician, blues musician.
[00:59:54.477 --> 00:59:58.599]  And he's putting on a big concert tonight for the Austin Toll Party.
[00:59:58.619 --> 00:59:59.600]  He's doing it for free.
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:02.042]  And a lot of his compadres are as well.
[01:00:03.122 --> 01:00:07.885]  And it's $30 at the door, $25 online or at one of the ticket agencies.
[01:00:08.286 --> 01:00:10.387]  Or if you buy multiple tickets, they're like $20 apiece.
[01:00:10.707 --> 01:00:12.889]  And all of it goes to fight toll roads!
[01:00:13.869 --> 01:00:19.173]  Regardless of where you live in this nation, you need to go to austintollparty.com and buy some tickets.
[01:00:19.353 --> 01:00:21.194]  Even if you're not going to use them, we'll give them to somebody.
[01:00:22.552 --> 01:00:27.957]  Because, they admit in USA Today, Texas is the frontline battle state, as I told you years ago.
[01:00:28.517 --> 01:00:29.958]  This is where they're trying to do it.
[01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:41.608]  And it is wildly unpopular, 98% again in Houston, 93% in Austin Poles, against the 6,000 miles of toll roads to be in this state alone.
[01:00:42.068 --> 01:00:43.950]  But the government says, we don't care.
[01:00:44.430 --> 01:00:49.655]  Sal Castillo is the founder of the Austin Toll Party, just got tired of it, he lives in my neighborhood.
[01:00:51.164 --> 01:00:53.545]  In the same area, and they were going to put toll roads all around us.
[01:00:54.205 --> 01:00:56.746]  He got sick of it and took action and has had a great effect.
[01:00:57.106 --> 01:00:59.087]  Showing that you can fight City Hall.
[01:00:59.587 --> 01:01:00.667]  And we're never going to stop.
[01:01:00.747 --> 01:01:02.728]  Sal, good to have you on with us my friend.
[01:01:03.308 --> 01:01:04.608]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on.
[01:01:04.949 --> 01:01:05.429]  You bet.
[01:01:05.449 --> 01:01:06.149]  Thank you.
[01:01:06.249 --> 01:01:09.030]  And I want to say one thing to folks that are listening.
[01:01:09.410 --> 01:01:10.730]  These aren't regular toll roads.
[01:01:10.951 --> 01:01:12.431]  This is a new animal.
[01:01:12.971 --> 01:01:15.592]  These tolls go on our freeways.
[01:01:16.092 --> 01:01:18.353]  Existing roads with a transponder.
[01:01:19.248 --> 01:01:21.450]  Yeah, that's what makes this so horrible.
[01:01:22.371 --> 01:01:34.964]  Toll roads in and of themselves aren't a horribly bad thing, but when they start tolling your freeways, when they forget that they're called freeways, that's the problem where people have to pay a toll to get to work, school, and play.
[01:01:34.984 --> 01:01:37.667]  It's called absolute corporate raping and looting.
[01:01:38.417 --> 01:01:41.320]  It's a private group doing this all over the country.
[01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:42.802]  The Feds are pushing it.
[01:01:43.262 --> 01:01:45.725]  And they're going to take our existing roads and turn them into toll roads.
[01:01:45.905 --> 01:01:46.546]  That's right.
[01:01:46.586 --> 01:01:55.295]  They take our freeway system and then they want to privatize them and sell us out to the special interests so that they can make tons of profit.
[01:01:56.105 --> 01:02:01.629]  Uh, and the rates that they're stating for these roads keep going up and up and up.
[01:02:02.069 --> 01:02:04.531]  The national average is 9 cents a mile.
[01:02:05.151 --> 01:02:07.373]  And they said they're going to charge 12 cents a mile.
[01:02:07.453 --> 01:02:10.375]  Now, that was last year, now they're talking about 44 cents a mile.
[01:02:10.435 --> 01:02:13.397]  And the comptroller found one that's a dollar a mile.
[01:02:14.557 --> 01:02:15.358]  Ha ha ha ha!
[01:02:16.099 --> 01:02:17.760]  And the, uh, that's all been in the news.
[01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:23.944]  And the TxDOT documents, Texas Department of Transportation, admits they're swimming in cash.
[01:02:24.284 --> 01:02:25.665]  They've got plenty of money!
[01:02:26.784 --> 01:02:31.926]  But that's for your eyes only when it came out in the paper, when Bruce McCracken, the City Councilman, released it.
[01:02:32.226 --> 01:02:34.007]  We're not supposed to see that, Sal.
[01:02:34.527 --> 01:02:34.887]  That's right.
[01:02:34.907 --> 01:02:36.988]  Because we might be with Al Qaeda.
[01:02:37.588 --> 01:02:38.008]  That's right.
[01:02:38.088 --> 01:02:44.870]  And what you've got is you've got politicians like Rick Perry, who's taken over a million dollars in contributions from the toll and road lobby.
[01:02:44.890 --> 01:02:47.271]  Because a lot of people say, well, why would they do that to you?
[01:02:47.711 --> 01:02:51.893]  Well, it's because our politicians have been bought and paid for, and they've sold us out.
[01:02:53.434 --> 01:03:02.000]  And what we're doing tonight, just like the Boston Tea Party made history hundreds of years ago, we are going to make history tonight.
[01:03:02.761 --> 01:03:04.602]  We're going to take a stand.
[01:03:04.962 --> 01:03:09.745]  Tonight's Benefit Concert, and we thank Jimmy Vaughn and all his friends.
[01:03:09.865 --> 01:03:10.526]  We cannot wait.
[01:03:10.546 --> 01:03:11.146]  It's going to be great.
[01:03:11.526 --> 01:03:16.870]  But tonight's Benefit Concert is all about building a war chest to put an end to this once and for all.
[01:03:17.671 --> 01:03:22.394]  And we're going to need the money for political fight and the legal fight.
[01:03:22.881 --> 01:03:25.243]  We've had it, and we want to kill it.
[01:03:25.283 --> 01:03:28.006]  We've had huge success over the past year.
[01:03:28.366 --> 01:03:29.727]  We've got one toll road pulled.
[01:03:29.787 --> 01:03:32.149]  It happens to be in yours and my neighborhood.
[01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:39.315]  We fully paid for that already, and they're going to open it in just a few weeks as a freeway, because we fought for it, and we got it back.
[01:03:39.416 --> 01:03:40.617]  Now we're going to put tolls on it.
[01:03:40.797 --> 01:03:41.557]  Stay there, Sal.
[01:03:41.597 --> 01:03:43.259]  We're going to be right back after this quick break.
[01:03:43.279 --> 01:03:45.861]  And we're going to have Jimmy Vaughn on with us.
[01:03:45.881 --> 01:03:47.222]  He's riding shotgun right now.
[01:03:47.282 --> 01:03:48.323]  He's in the wings.
[01:03:49.064 --> 01:03:49.464]  Get ready.
[01:03:49.504 --> 01:03:50.105]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:54.157 --> 01:03:57.056]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[01:03:57.748 --> 01:03:59.049]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:03:59.249 --> 01:04:04.993]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.

[01:04:19.184 --> 01:04:23.807]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:04:23.907 --> 01:04:26.649]  Troops on the streets, foreign NACO aircraft in the skies.
[01:04:26.969 --> 01:04:30.130]  Psychotic UN Population Control Plans and much, much more.
[01:04:30.190 --> 01:04:32.091]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[01:04:56.114 --> 01:04:58.896]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:59.156 --> 01:05:03.319]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:04.580]  So what do you do?
[01:05:04.901 --> 01:05:09.464]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:09.944 --> 01:05:12.086]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[01:07:00.984 --> 01:07:02.125]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.745 --> 01:07:03.585]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.326 --> 01:07:05.086]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.874 --> 01:07:09.817]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.058 --> 01:07:14.181]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:19.426 --> 01:07:22.508]  Alright, 8 minutes, 27 seconds into the second hour.
[01:07:22.568 --> 01:07:24.710]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:28.193]  Coming up, we're going to get more into the economy and what Greenspan says about it.
[01:07:28.253 --> 01:07:30.335]  He says it could plunge, basically.
[01:07:31.138 --> 01:07:36.784]  Also more on this new national ID card legislation that is on the verge of passing.
[01:07:36.804 --> 01:07:42.370]  Schwarzenegger backtracking on his close the border statement, but he didn't really say that.
[01:07:42.751 --> 01:07:47.396]  He added the addendum that he wanted to follow the Bush plan for total amnesty.
[01:07:47.416 --> 01:07:50.219]  That's how they want to fix the illegal alien problem, just legalize all of them.
[01:07:51.039 --> 01:07:52.901]  That's all coming up for the next
[01:07:54.096 --> 01:08:00.761]  Well, the next 30 or 40 minutes we're going to have South Estella along with us, but we're just going to have Jimmy Vaughn for a couple of segments here because I know he's so busy.
[01:08:01.722 --> 01:08:07.427]  I've really got to commend Jimmy because he has been all over radio, all over TV.
[01:08:08.087 --> 01:08:15.993]  He's doing this for free, brought a lot of his friends in, other award-winning, Grammy award-winning musicians like himself.
[01:08:17.054 --> 01:08:21.398]  He's been going on radio shows and playing his guitar live on the air.
[01:08:22.476 --> 01:08:35.968]  He's been doing a press conference, and he's a humble guy, a really intelligent fellow, but also very, very humble, and doesn't really like the spotlight when it comes to politics and the media.
[01:08:36.408 --> 01:08:44.215]  But he is a great blues player, and it's great to have him and so many other Central Texans and people around the country.
[01:08:44.595 --> 01:08:50.360]  We just had a call earlier, somebody trying to fly down here, but blocked by snowstorms out of Nebraska.
[01:08:51.269 --> 01:09:00.286]  Wanting to come to the benefit concert tonight at the Double Tree North Hotel in that big old banquet room that holds about 2,000 people.
[01:09:02.350 --> 01:09:17.457]  And riding shotgun with us, of course, is Sal Castillo, who founded the Austin Toll Party, now part of a national movement against these corporate, federal, manipulated toll roads that take existing freeways and turn them into transponder-tracked toll roads.
[01:09:17.897 --> 01:09:21.318]  The later plan is to put satellite tracking in as well.
[01:09:21.538 --> 01:09:22.679]  But now it's happening.
[01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:28.081]  And the tip of the globalist spear is right here in Central Texas.
[01:09:28.141 --> 01:09:31.583]  If they can do it here, they can do it anywhere.
[01:09:32.410 --> 01:09:34.011]  Jimmy Vaughn, it's great to have you on.
[01:09:34.031 --> 01:09:35.012]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:09:35.532 --> 01:09:36.433]  I'm doing pretty good.
[01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:39.115]  I'm excited to be on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:09:39.775 --> 01:09:41.196]  This is a real trip.
[01:09:43.398 --> 01:09:52.224]  Thanks for having us on and for promoting the show and, you know, saying all those nice things.
[01:09:52.304 --> 01:09:57.848]  But, you know, really, I can't find anybody for toll roads, you know?
[01:09:58.808 --> 01:10:01.350]  Building a toll road, a new road, and then
[01:10:01.772 --> 01:10:12.461]  Then putting a toll on it and paying the toll off and then, you know, have it becoming another so-called freeway is one thing, but these roads, these are our roads.
[01:10:12.501 --> 01:10:14.303]  I mean, nobody's going to be able to afford to go to work.
[01:10:14.863 --> 01:10:19.207]  I can't even get out of my neighborhood without getting on one, and probably you can't either.
[01:10:19.507 --> 01:10:24.632]  So, it was the least I can do, and believe me, there's a lot of people that don't like this.
[01:10:25.313 --> 01:10:29.316]  Well, 98% in Houston polls, 93% in Austin polls.
[01:10:29.436 --> 01:10:37.521]  I've never found anyone, Jimmy, who is for it other than a few publicly paid-off bureaucrats.
[01:10:37.541 --> 01:10:43.605]  Folks, we're talking about thousands of dollars a year just in Austin alone per family.
[01:10:43.925 --> 01:10:46.127]  Thousands more outside of the cities.
[01:10:47.187 --> 01:10:50.690]  Sal Castillo, we've got their own numbers.
[01:10:51.150 --> 01:10:52.091]  6,000 miles of toll roads.
[01:10:52.311 --> 01:10:53.411]  There's only 7,000 in the whole country.
[01:10:54.492 --> 01:10:56.133]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:10:56.153 --> 01:10:57.774]  $6,000, that is what Perry is looking for.
[01:10:58.714 --> 01:11:08.359]  There's a couple thousand that are on the books right now for urban areas, and then $4,000 for the Trans-Texas Corridor, which is a whole other boondoggle, a whole other show.
[01:11:09.179 --> 01:11:19.364]  But yeah, this is tolling freeways, which has never been done before in our country, and if they're able to do it here, and everybody else is watching this, all the other states,
[01:11:19.944 --> 01:11:21.745]  It's going to come to your freeway.
[01:11:22.245 --> 01:11:26.826]  So this is a frontline battle and we're hoping everybody can step up and go to our website.
[01:11:27.246 --> 01:11:35.749]  You can even go to AustinTollParty.com if you're out of the state or out of the area and if you want to get a really cool t-shirt, go to step 5.
[01:11:36.209 --> 01:11:40.471]  Go to AustinTollParty.com and step 5, Tolling Texas Freeways t-shirt.
[01:11:40.511 --> 01:11:41.071]  It's really cool.
[01:11:42.029 --> 01:11:44.290]  And, folks, you should do this all over the country.
[01:11:44.350 --> 01:11:46.010]  Start your own grassroots movements.
[01:11:46.150 --> 01:11:46.851]  Get serious.
[01:11:46.911 --> 01:11:47.651]  Get focused.
[01:11:48.011 --> 01:11:49.512]  Don't say, oh, I can't affect change.
[01:11:49.532 --> 01:11:50.352]  There's nothing I can do.
[01:11:50.732 --> 01:11:51.312]  You can.
[01:11:51.372 --> 01:11:52.793]  You've just simply got to get involved.
[01:11:53.093 --> 01:11:58.295]  And speaking of getting involved, Jimmy Vaughn, for folks who want to go to his website, it's JimmyVaughn.com.
[01:11:58.315 --> 01:11:59.035]  There's a link to it.
[01:11:59.835 --> 01:12:08.319]  Over at the AustinTollParty.com, also on Infowars.com, Jimmy's got the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution there on his site.
[01:12:08.679 --> 01:12:10.620]  Jimmy, what made you get involved?
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:18.844]  What made you, you know, start waking up to the toll roads, but not just the toll roads, to this whole attack on our liberties and our freedoms?
[01:12:19.965 --> 01:12:23.046]  Well, you know, it's been a long process.
[01:12:23.066 --> 01:12:29.069]  When I was a kid, I grew up in Dallas, I think, like you did, and I was in school, you know, when Kennedy got
[01:12:29.761 --> 01:12:30.302]  That's great.
[01:12:51.141 --> 01:12:54.122]  Skeptical, you could say, about, you know, all this stuff.
[01:12:54.702 --> 01:12:56.862]  I had all these big questions as a kid, you know.
[01:12:57.162 --> 01:12:59.483]  You hear people say something and you go, you know, that just couldn't be right.
[01:12:59.503 --> 01:13:02.804]  You know, that little quiet voice that tells you it's not right.
[01:13:04.324 --> 01:13:06.785]  So you instinctively always knew something was wrong?
[01:13:07.085 --> 01:13:08.645]  Yeah, yeah, I did.
[01:13:09.985 --> 01:13:14.527]  But I didn't know what, and nobody knew the answers, and there weren't even really questions you asked.
[01:13:14.927 --> 01:13:18.908]  And then I, you know, I went on through school and I became, I wanted to be a musician.
[01:13:21.318 --> 01:13:22.299]  One thing led to another.
[01:13:22.339 --> 01:13:26.920]  Like when I got into music, I would find, for instance, I would find B.B.
[01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:28.881]  King, and I'd go, man, this guy is unbelievable.
[01:13:28.921 --> 01:13:33.583]  And then I would read about B.B., and he would say who he liked, and I would go learn about the guy he liked.
[01:13:34.023 --> 01:13:37.685]  And then, you know, it was sort of a backwards history lesson in music.
[01:13:37.965 --> 01:13:43.727]  And that's the way I've done on all this stuff, this liberty thing.
[01:13:44.107 --> 01:13:49.970]  That's how I got into the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and a lot of it.
[01:13:51.345 --> 01:14:05.853]  You know, I love the Alex Jones Show, and I like your websites, and I've learned so much, you know, from just reading the alternative news, and that you gather up so good, and things like that, you know.
[01:14:05.913 --> 01:14:12.156]  And then I was lucky, and I got to meet Ron Paul, and it's just amazing.
[01:14:13.157 --> 01:14:15.178]  It's been an amazing journey, anyway.
[01:14:17.039 --> 01:14:19.360]  You know, and this Toll Road thing is just
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:21.080]  Absolutely crazy.
[01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:22.120]  How did this happen?
[01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:26.802]  Because I haven't asked Sal, or I haven't asked you, and now I guess is a good time.
[01:14:26.842 --> 01:14:30.182]  I mean, everybody's probably wondering, when did it finally crystallize?
[01:14:30.202 --> 01:14:33.623]  I mean, whose idea was it to have this benefit concert?
[01:14:33.643 --> 01:14:34.883]  Because this is exciting.
[01:14:34.983 --> 01:14:36.064]  Well, I'll tell you what happened.
[01:14:36.244 --> 01:14:42.045]  I was doing the, you know, remember the petition in Austin to recall the people who voted for this?
[01:14:42.185 --> 01:14:42.325]  Yes.
[01:14:43.085 --> 01:14:46.666]  I filled out my petition and got people to sign it.
[01:14:47.563 --> 01:14:49.004]  And I just turned it in.
[01:14:49.044 --> 01:14:51.545]  I was over in the neighborhood and I saw that I was close to the address.
[01:14:51.565 --> 01:14:56.647]  So I stopped in and I was just giving them a donation and turning in my petition.
[01:14:57.607 --> 01:15:04.230]  And I met Linda Curtis over there and she said, well, would you play for us?
[01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:06.311]  And I said, well, sure I would, I guess.
[01:15:06.351 --> 01:15:07.071]  You know, why not?
[01:15:08.552 --> 01:15:09.773]  But it was pretty instant.
[01:15:09.793 --> 01:15:12.874]  I just met Sal like a couple of days ago at the press conference.
[01:15:13.174 --> 01:15:13.554]  That's right.
[01:15:13.694 --> 01:15:15.255]  This was organized pretty quick.
[01:15:16.092 --> 01:15:24.581]  Yeah, and I just appreciated what they were doing and if it hadn't been for Sal's website and all the people working down there, I wouldn't have known about it.
[01:15:26.362 --> 01:15:37.954]  I've seen a lot of this stuff, Alex, that you reported the stories out of every major newspaper and I was kind of following along there, but to see it locally right in your face
[01:15:38.601 --> 01:15:42.004]  From people you know right in your hometown is a real eye-opener.
[01:15:42.244 --> 01:15:51.251]  And then to learn that this is the zenith point, this is the flashpoint, this is where Austin is the center of their plan for Texas.
[01:15:51.311 --> 01:15:55.634]  Texas is the center of their plan for the entire country and the NAFTA highway.
[01:15:56.655 --> 01:15:57.496]  It's just incredible.
[01:15:57.536 --> 01:16:05.542]  And I don't want any... And this other thing about this chip in the inspection sticker, that just sent my blood pressure up to the roof.
[01:16:06.443 --> 01:16:07.264]  Believe me, I mean,
[01:16:08.359 --> 01:16:11.620]  You know, this is not what Liberty is about.
[01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:14.400]  And that bill is introduced, they're trying to pass it.
[01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:21.661]  Sal, have we defeated that bill yet to put a transponder, which they admit is for tolling at the toll roads, in all the inspection stickers yet?
[01:16:22.081 --> 01:16:23.102]  No, we haven't yet.
[01:16:24.242 --> 01:16:27.222]  We are getting action items onto our website.
[01:16:27.262 --> 01:16:36.384]  We have one right now that calls for... It allows people the choice to choose between tolls and gas tax.
[01:16:37.567 --> 01:16:40.148]  Um, which is a drastic difference in cost.
[01:16:40.708 --> 01:16:43.589]  But we hope to have something up in the next week or two on that.
[01:16:43.609 --> 01:16:46.771]  There are so many... I mean, that's actually, that's even ridiculous.
[01:16:47.311 --> 01:16:50.332]  Oh, yeah, I mean... It's like three steps forward, one step back.
[01:16:50.372 --> 01:16:52.593]  Well, okay, well... Well, yeah.
[01:16:52.613 --> 01:17:01.476]  There are dozens and dozens of horrible bills that are coming out of Mike Cruz's, uh, Transportation Commission, uh, here in Texas.
[01:17:02.617 --> 01:17:11.563]  It's hard to keep track of what's happening because so many people are connecting with us and telling us about these bad bills, but we're doing the best we can.
[01:17:11.623 --> 01:17:14.525]  I'll tell you, Sal, I have the federal plan, and that's it.
[01:17:15.525 --> 01:17:16.546]  In all your cars,
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:20.303]  The Feds tell the states, do this or no highway money.
[01:17:20.363 --> 01:17:21.965]  They put transponders in all the cars.
[01:17:22.205 --> 01:17:23.306]  Schwarzenegger's trying it.
[01:17:23.526 --> 01:17:26.209]  They're trying to do it in New York, Oregon, all over the place.
[01:17:26.770 --> 01:17:29.032]  And then they will turn every road.
[01:17:29.613 --> 01:17:30.534]  London's already doing it.
[01:17:30.794 --> 01:17:31.675]  I have articles today.
[01:17:31.895 --> 01:17:35.519]  They are planning to turn every road, every major road, into a toll road.
[01:17:36.139 --> 01:17:39.141]  And when we get back, I want to talk about some of the numbers they're discussing.
[01:17:39.201 --> 01:17:45.444]  As you said, a dollar per mile on one of these tolls that's going in in Austin.
[01:17:45.464 --> 01:17:47.986]  And they keep saying, trust us, don't worry, no tollbooth.
[01:17:48.426 --> 01:17:50.607]  Yeah, because it's going to be a transponder.
[01:17:50.907 --> 01:17:52.929]  That's what the TxDOT documents say.
[01:17:53.369 --> 01:17:56.311]  And as Jimmy just said, it's a bait-and-switch.
[01:17:56.611 --> 01:17:58.412]  We have the TxDOT documents.
[01:17:58.432 --> 01:17:59.552]  They have plenty of money.
[01:17:59.792 --> 01:18:02.814]  They don't need this regional, three-county gas tax.
[01:18:02.834 --> 01:18:03.995]  But as you said, Sal,
[01:18:05.256 --> 01:18:11.519]  That is a fraction of what the transponder tax would be, but at the same time, I want to defeat both of them.
[01:18:11.779 --> 01:18:17.763]  You, I guess, see it as positive, in that at least you're making them kind of try to back off and only get part of what they want.
[01:18:18.023 --> 01:18:23.866]  But yeah, and also it allows the community, more people in the community to get involved, and it starts a dialogue.
[01:18:23.906 --> 01:18:25.147]  The dialogue is so important.
[01:18:25.167 --> 01:18:26.248]  Because there's been no dialogue.
[01:18:26.268 --> 01:18:27.348]  They're saying, are aware of the highways.
[01:18:27.428 --> 01:18:28.029]  Exactly.
[01:18:28.049 --> 01:18:29.650]  Jimmy Vaughn, can you stay with us a little bit longer?
[01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:30.090]  Sure.
[01:18:30.490 --> 01:18:31.531]  Alright, now what about you, Sal?
[01:18:32.171 --> 01:18:32.712]  Sure, I'll be here.
[01:18:32.992 --> 01:18:37.016]  Alright, we'll be right back after this quick break and we'll get into the concert tonight.
[01:18:37.536 --> 01:18:38.577]  I also want to talk about that.
[01:18:38.737 --> 01:18:41.560]  I want to talk about how people get tickets, where it's going to be located.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:42.721]  I'm going to be there.
[01:18:42.961 --> 01:18:43.702]  I cannot wait.
[01:18:43.782 --> 01:18:44.983]  I hope to see you there.
[01:18:45.404 --> 01:18:47.185]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[01:18:47.426 --> 01:18:49.668]  Find out more details at InfoWars.com

[01:20:54.732 --> 01:21:00.476]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:21:00.736 --> 01:21:05.880]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.

[01:21:15.846 --> 01:21:20.788]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:21:21.109 --> 01:21:25.131]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.

[01:21:52.998 --> 01:21:55.340]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:59.443]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:21:59.763 --> 01:22:00.584]  Read the labels.
[01:22:01.004 --> 01:22:05.147]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:22:05.347 --> 01:22:09.550]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:22:09.930 --> 01:22:14.794]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.

[01:23:00.066 --> 01:23:05.108]  Alright, Jimmy's going to stay with us a little bit in the next segment so we have plenty of time to talk about all these important subjects.
[01:23:05.588 --> 01:23:11.469]  But right now with Jimmy Vaughn and Sal Castillo on talking about the benefit concert tonight.
[01:23:12.030 --> 01:23:15.631]  Again, the bands that are going to be there, they're donating their time, they're donating their energy.
[01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:19.332]  They've got a press conference, been on all these radio talk shows promoting it.
[01:23:20.312 --> 01:23:23.813]  The least you can do around the country, even if you're not coming,
[01:23:24.746 --> 01:23:29.029]  is buy some of these tickets and then note there in the comments section that you want them to be given to folks.
[01:23:29.450 --> 01:23:33.732]  We'll make sure they get to people because this is going to a political war chest to fight this.
[01:23:34.153 --> 01:23:34.873]  We're in a fight.
[01:23:34.953 --> 01:23:35.974]  We're fighting to win.
[01:23:36.454 --> 01:23:39.476]  We have the people behind us, the Constitution and common sense.
[01:23:39.837 --> 01:23:43.940]  Jimmy Vaughn, tell us about the concert that's coming up tonight at the Doubletree North.
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:48.863]  Well, we got a lot of people on the show
[01:23:50.854 --> 01:23:52.435]  Sal's got the list over there.
[01:23:52.815 --> 01:23:57.038]  Just for my part of the show, I've got the great James Cotton is going to come play.
[01:23:57.798 --> 01:24:09.906]  James Cotton was the great harmonica player that played with Muddy Waters Band and sort of, you know, was one of the main guys that wrote the... but he was the founding father of the harmonica, okay?
[01:24:11.707 --> 01:24:13.888]  You can't say enough about James Cotton.
[01:24:14.048 --> 01:24:15.529]  Anyway, he lives in Austin.
[01:24:15.549 --> 01:24:16.490]  He's going to come play.
[01:24:17.010 --> 01:24:17.931]  I've got Luann Barton.
[01:24:17.951 --> 01:24:19.752]  I've got my band, the Tilted World Band.
[01:24:20.736 --> 01:24:27.322]  I got a lot of several young musicians from around town that are up-and-coming blues guys.
[01:24:27.342 --> 01:24:29.003]  Barry Clark Jr.
[01:24:29.243 --> 01:24:31.445]  and I think WC is going to come by.
[01:24:31.465 --> 01:24:40.353]  I got Ephraim Owen who plays a fantastic trumpet and we're just going to do a great show and do what we do, you know, for the cause.
[01:24:41.674 --> 01:24:45.997]  And I want to, you know, invite all these people around town.
[01:24:46.017 --> 01:24:49.280]  There must be millions of antique
[01:24:50.046 --> 01:24:50.266]  I don't
[01:25:12.286 --> 01:25:13.846]  That's a good point.
[01:25:13.886 --> 01:25:20.809]  I mean, we were talking about it, Sal was talking about it a year ago, but the media just kind of ignored it and kept it a secret.
[01:25:21.069 --> 01:25:26.152]  We've now blown this thing wide open where we are having a real debate and a real dialogue.
[01:25:26.452 --> 01:25:28.133]  This is an important fight.
[01:25:28.213 --> 01:25:33.435]  Mobility, transportation, the freedom of the open road, that is pure Americana.
[01:25:34.153 --> 01:25:40.177]  And we're talking about thousands of dollars, conservatively a year, per driver, per vehicle here.
[01:25:40.537 --> 01:25:42.099]  This is TxDOT's own numbers.
[01:25:42.819 --> 01:25:44.160]  Sal, tell us how we get tickets.
[01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:48.523]  Yes, we get tickets by going to austintollparty.com.
[01:25:49.023 --> 01:25:51.425]  You can get tickets online through PayPal right there.
[01:25:52.145 --> 01:25:58.870]  You can go into a Pinky's Wireless here in Central Texas, or you can call us at our office.
[01:25:59.410 --> 01:26:00.671]  We'll give you that number 512-371-
[01:26:03.991 --> 01:26:06.473]  9-9-2-6, that's 3-7-1-9-9-2-6.
[01:26:06.493 --> 01:26:09.676]  With a 5-1-2 in front of it.
[01:26:09.956 --> 01:26:18.284]  And what I've done is, I was given four tickets but I bought five more and I've just given them away to friends and family because I believe in this as well.
[01:26:18.804 --> 01:26:29.734]  That's right, and you're coming tonight to introduce Jimmy and we even have the comptroller of the state of Texas taking a stand and saying no, do not put tolls on roads we've already paid for.
[01:26:31.368 --> 01:26:32.669]  Well, I mean, it's... That's right.
[01:26:33.049 --> 01:26:35.230]  I can't see how any politician could be for this.
[01:26:35.250 --> 01:26:38.212]  I mean, I've never seen an issue where you've got the high 90's against it.
[01:26:38.552 --> 01:26:42.515]  Oh yeah, but all the local politicians voted, most of them voted for it.
[01:26:43.715 --> 01:26:51.240]  You know, and we've got the Governor, Perry, who's been pushing this through his Texas Transportation Commission.
[01:26:52.181 --> 01:26:56.143]  But yeah, it's amazing that the politicians are silly enough to keep pushing this.
[01:26:57.814 --> 01:26:58.315]  Absolutely.
[01:26:58.335 --> 01:27:01.359]  People are not going to be able to drive to work.
[01:27:03.321 --> 01:27:03.782]  That's right.
[01:27:03.802 --> 01:27:05.685]  They'll drive to work, but they're going to be charged.
[01:27:06.205 --> 01:27:10.411]  And it just takes the affordability issue to a whole new level.
[01:27:10.691 --> 01:27:13.435]  And the sad part of this is you've got the toll authority
[01:27:15.109 --> 01:27:17.430]  Who are unelected officials, unaccountable.
[01:27:18.211 --> 01:27:20.832]  They decide how much you're going to pay when you go to work.
[01:27:20.993 --> 01:27:24.295]  And we've got their own numbers, as you said, a dollar a mile in some cases.
[01:27:24.975 --> 01:27:29.798]  Jimmy, their own numbers are eighteen hundred and something bucks per car per family.
[01:27:30.158 --> 01:27:38.344]  I mean, I know a lot of people who eighteen hundred and fifty something dollars, I mean, that would be insurance, health insurance for their whole family.
[01:27:38.664 --> 01:27:41.386]  Yeah, that's health insurance, that's car insurance, that's
[01:27:42.213 --> 01:27:48.896]  You know, I mean, we already know that the gas, they're telling us every day the gas prices are going to go up, and they go up every summer anyway, so.
[01:27:49.516 --> 01:28:06.122]  But this time, they're going to go up, and this, you know, to me, it looks like to me this has nothing to do with easing traffic jams or making a better way of life for anyone, like they kind of spin it, but this is just a track and trace with the computer chip.
[01:28:06.582 --> 01:28:08.023]  I just, I'm just against it.
[01:28:08.883 --> 01:28:09.363]  All the way.
[01:28:09.783 --> 01:28:12.444]  Well, so am I, Jimmy, and we commend you for doing this.
[01:28:12.484 --> 01:28:13.905]  We want to thank you for doing this.
[01:28:14.485 --> 01:28:15.826]  When we come back... My pleasure.
[01:28:15.846 --> 01:28:16.246]  Oh, you bet.
[01:28:16.306 --> 01:28:17.266]  Just stay with us a few more minutes.
[01:28:17.286 --> 01:28:21.668]  When we come back, we'll give out that number again on the website and tell people how they can come tonight.
[01:28:22.468 --> 01:28:23.089]  Seriously.
[01:28:23.629 --> 01:28:26.470]  It's going to be going from 7.30 to midnight this evening.
[01:28:27.270 --> 01:28:30.892]  Just an action-packed, star-studded lineup, and I like the blues myself.
[01:28:32.172 --> 01:28:34.513]  I can't stand all this new rock and roll and
[01:28:35.319 --> 01:28:37.841]  And all the rest of it, but I really do enjoy the blues.
[01:28:38.321 --> 01:28:41.343]  And some of the best blues out there, bar none, so you be sure and be there.
[01:28:43.884 --> 01:28:44.765]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.265 --> 01:28:46.866]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.786 --> 01:28:50.448]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:56.033 --> 01:29:01.536]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:01.936 --> 01:29:06.178]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:29:06.418 --> 01:29:13.421]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:13.821 --> 01:29:19.925]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:20.065 --> 01:29:21.326]  There are no side effects.
[01:29:21.626 --> 01:29:24.588]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:29:24.728 --> 01:29:25.629]  Eliminate the cost.
[01:29:25.709 --> 01:29:26.770]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:29:27.070 --> 01:29:34.314]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:29:34.615 --> 01:29:37.977]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[01:31:53.919 --> 01:31:59.464]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:04.312 --> 01:32:06.153]  JimmyVon.com.
[01:32:06.493 --> 01:32:09.315]  Jimmy and V-A-U-G-H-A-N.
[01:32:09.895 --> 01:32:10.796]  JimmyVon.com.
[01:32:10.816 --> 01:32:12.136]  Be sure to check out that great site.
[01:32:14.058 --> 01:32:15.738]  JimmyVon wins, the site says.
[01:32:15.819 --> 01:32:24.183]  Jimmy has won his fourth Grammy Award, this time for Best Traditional Blues Album for Do You Get the Blues at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards.
[01:32:24.223 --> 01:32:26.765]  This was Jimmy's tenth nomination.
[01:32:26.785 --> 01:32:32.568]  This award was special, meaning to Jimmy, as this is his first win for his own solo work.
[01:32:33.425 --> 01:32:35.806]  And I hope you get that CD.
[01:32:35.866 --> 01:32:37.767]  I know I have it myself.
[01:32:38.247 --> 01:32:39.308]  Do you get the blues?
[01:32:39.488 --> 01:32:42.149]  And I'm just plugging it because number one, it's good music.
[01:32:42.509 --> 01:32:47.351]  Number two, Jimmy is just a great guy out there tirelessly working to fight these toll roads.
[01:32:48.192 --> 01:33:03.262]  And it's refreshing to see prominent people, and more and more of them are taking action, really getting involved in truly patriotic issues, not phony left-right issues that the mainstream media is always out there promoting and pushing.
[01:33:03.582 --> 01:33:12.608]  Folks, if you want to call right now and reserve your tickets, so they've got them there for you at the door, when you get there, give them a call, the Austin Toll Party, 512-371-9926.
[01:33:17.995 --> 01:33:27.421]  512-371-9926 or go to austintollparty.com or you can get them at the door.
[01:33:28.042 --> 01:33:33.645]  Tell folks who aren't online where the Doubletree North is located, Sal or Jimmy.
[01:33:34.986 --> 01:33:38.028]  Yeah, the Doubletree North is at 6505 IH 35 North.
[01:33:38.068 --> 01:33:41.330]  That's right near the 290 interchange.
[01:33:46.235 --> 01:33:50.057]  All right, and it's a banquet hall that holds about, what, 2,000 people?
[01:33:50.537 --> 01:33:51.197]  Yeah, that's correct.
[01:33:52.237 --> 01:33:55.459]  And folks, I think they've already sold like 500, 600 tickets.
[01:33:55.499 --> 01:33:58.360]  And in Austin, people normally don't buy tickets beforehand.
[01:33:58.380 --> 01:33:59.180]  They go to the event.
[01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:02.241]  So there could be a chance that this sells out.
[01:34:02.722 --> 01:34:05.803]  So I certainly hope that you get your tickets now.
[01:34:06.323 --> 01:34:10.205]  Even if you're not going to come or you live in New York City, buy some tickets.
[01:34:10.305 --> 01:34:14.026]  Put in the email comment section that you want to give these out for free.
[01:34:16.427 --> 01:34:20.492]  When will the cut-off date for giving other people your tickets be, Sal?
[01:34:20.512 --> 01:34:23.795]  I mean, if somebody wanted to buy five tickets now, how would you go give those to people?
[01:34:24.035 --> 01:34:38.750]  Well, right now we're selling them will-call, so there are some folks that can't afford to pay $50 for two tickets if they're looking for two, and we're hoping that more people buy the tickets so that those folks can go.
[01:34:39.691 --> 01:34:39.871]  Yeah.
[01:34:40.615 --> 01:34:41.255]  Absolutely.
[01:34:41.656 --> 01:34:46.538]  Yeah, and plus this is, this all goes towards a political fight and a legal fight to stop this.
[01:34:46.938 --> 01:34:48.759]  We've had real good success over the past year.
[01:34:48.779 --> 01:34:54.462]  I want to run, I want to give you a quick update on what we've done so that people know that this is making a difference.
[01:34:54.883 --> 01:35:05.768]  We stopped one toll road, we postponed two others, we got one unfunded, and then get this, here's the big thing, most people don't know but there were eight additional toll roads all coming into Central Texas.
[01:35:06.209 --> 01:35:08.930]  These are going out to smaller towns all the way around
[01:35:09.794 --> 01:35:14.536]  Those eight toll roads, they actually pulled from the plan before they presented them.
[01:35:14.616 --> 01:35:19.218]  So, they put those on a back burner, hoping that we're going to go away, but obviously we're not.
[01:35:19.318 --> 01:35:22.499]  And understand folks, if you leave or enter the city, you're going to go through a toll road.
[01:35:22.919 --> 01:35:24.500]  That's right, and it's all about what they want.
[01:35:25.380 --> 01:35:36.985]  What makes these toll roads different, again, is they want to toll our freeways and roads we've already paid for, which is really, if you think about it, I mean it's absurd in so many levels.
[01:35:38.898 --> 01:35:40.389]  Well, Jimmy said it best earlier.
[01:35:42.182 --> 01:35:44.544]  I mean, this is totally against the American way of life.
[01:35:44.604 --> 01:35:45.584]  It's about control.
[01:35:45.644 --> 01:35:47.385]  It's about tracking and tracing.
[01:35:47.445 --> 01:35:48.326]  A transponder?
[01:35:48.346 --> 01:35:50.387]  I mean, that's how they're going to do this.
[01:35:50.447 --> 01:35:52.168]  They didn't ask us when we told them.
[01:35:52.428 --> 01:35:54.750]  You guys go to meetings and 2,000 people show up.
[01:35:54.790 --> 01:35:55.650]  It's been in the newspaper.
[01:35:55.950 --> 01:35:57.671]  And they say, raise your hand if you're for it.
[01:35:57.932 --> 01:36:01.394]  And two people in the audience raise their hands for the toll roads.
[01:36:01.774 --> 01:36:02.254]  Oh, sure.
[01:36:03.095 --> 01:36:05.596]  Can you imagine Rick Perry who's pushing this?
[01:36:06.056 --> 01:36:09.238]  As soon as the campaign begins for next year's governor's race,
[01:36:11.015 --> 01:36:15.464]  The candidates running against him are going to slam him on this issue and he's going to go bye-bye.
[01:36:15.744 --> 01:36:18.771]  Also, you guys have successfully ferreted out
[01:36:20.415 --> 01:36:21.376]  A lot of corruption.
[01:36:21.416 --> 01:36:23.577]  Attempted bribery has been all over the newspaper.
[01:36:23.938 --> 01:36:25.719]  Payoffs have been all over the newspaper.
[01:36:26.339 --> 01:36:30.082]  And again, six, eight months ago, nobody told what, told who.
[01:36:30.582 --> 01:36:31.923]  I mean, nobody even knew about this.
[01:36:32.443 --> 01:36:32.903]  Exactly.
[01:36:32.943 --> 01:36:39.247]  We have elected officials, Donna Duke, state representative, who voted for the plan.
[01:36:39.267 --> 01:36:44.811]  Now, the morning after she voted for the plan, her sister got contracts with the toll authority.
[01:36:47.705 --> 01:36:50.067]  Jimmy, that sounds like some foreign third world country.
[01:36:50.087 --> 01:36:50.628]  Any comments?
[01:36:50.648 --> 01:36:52.049]  Well, it sounds like the music business.
[01:36:54.371 --> 01:36:56.853]  But no, it doesn't sound like Texas.
[01:36:57.453 --> 01:37:01.396]  Maybe some people say it does, but it's not what I thought Texas was about.
[01:37:02.217 --> 01:37:07.541]  It's not what I want my family and my friends to have to live by.
[01:37:07.921 --> 01:37:09.162]  It just doesn't make any sense.
[01:37:09.523 --> 01:37:10.444]  It's just not right.
[01:37:10.464 --> 01:37:13.386]  I don't know how to get any stronger than that.
[01:37:15.555 --> 01:37:21.659]  Again, I want to tell all these hot rod nuts and these car guys all over the country that might be listening.
[01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:31.666]  You're all going to be... It's coming to a town near you soon, so here's your chance to get in on the ground floor on this thing.
[01:37:31.927 --> 01:37:36.190]  Well, they know that America is built in sprawling cities and small towns.
[01:37:36.270 --> 01:37:38.151]  It's designed for the automobile.
[01:37:38.171 --> 01:37:41.493]  We're not 2,000, 1,500-year-old European cities.
[01:37:41.934 --> 01:37:43.515]  We have to have our automobiles.
[01:37:44.469 --> 01:37:51.917]  And this is all about social engineering, but it's also about the private corporations that get to administer these and reap the profits from it.
[01:37:51.937 --> 01:37:52.878]  It's not free market.
[01:37:52.898 --> 01:37:54.519]  It is organized crime.
[01:37:54.539 --> 01:37:58.023]  And we're standing up against big city machine corruption here.
[01:37:58.523 --> 01:38:00.225]  And so I want to see everybody there tonight.
[01:38:00.265 --> 01:38:01.386]  Give them a call right now.
[01:38:01.726 --> 01:38:02.367]  Buy the tickets.
[01:38:02.387 --> 01:38:02.647]  512-371-9926.
[01:38:02.747 --> 01:38:03.969]  And it's a great place to network.
[01:38:07.572 --> 01:38:08.953]  To meet like-minded people.
[01:38:09.393 --> 01:38:15.077]  This is going to be a great crew of folks and a very diverse crowd from across the political spectrum.
[01:38:15.798 --> 01:38:16.618]  Sal, any comments?
[01:38:16.938 --> 01:38:17.699]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:38:18.019 --> 01:38:22.282]  You know, a lot of people come up to me and say, well, is this a Republican or Democrat issue?
[01:38:22.722 --> 01:38:25.924]  And the fact is, the people under our tent is everybody.
[01:38:25.944 --> 01:38:31.408]  We're talking about Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, Independents, Environmentalists.
[01:38:31.528 --> 01:38:33.609]  I mean, we've even got, we've probably got Communists.
[01:38:33.669 --> 01:38:34.490]  I mean, everybody.
[01:38:35.006 --> 01:38:35.807]  It's under this tent.
[01:38:35.827 --> 01:38:41.512]  The only people that aren't are the ones that are basically getting paid off to push this.
[01:38:41.712 --> 01:38:42.973]  It's the same thing with immigration.
[01:38:42.993 --> 01:38:47.898]  87% of people are against it, including the majority of Hispanics, but the media acts like everybody's for it.
[01:38:49.559 --> 01:38:52.142]  It's issue after issue, but this one is key.
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:55.441]  Sal Castillo and of course Jimmy Vaughn.
[01:38:55.461 --> 01:38:56.962]  I can't wait to see you there tonight.
[01:38:57.002 --> 01:39:01.264]  Jimmy, you're going to be taking the stage with your band at about 10 p.m., correct?
[01:39:01.284 --> 01:39:02.124]  Yeah, something like that.
[01:39:03.025 --> 01:39:07.147]  We don't know exactly for sure, but we're going to have it worked out.
[01:39:07.647 --> 01:39:14.351]  There's a lot of people that are going to show up that we don't even know about, if they all show up.
[01:39:15.371 --> 01:39:16.352]  We're going to get it all in.
[01:39:18.394 --> 01:39:20.935]  Tell them the other guys that are playing.
[01:39:21.155 --> 01:39:26.378]  Yeah, we've got Bruce Jones and the Monotones, which are fantastic.
[01:39:26.458 --> 01:39:35.322]  And then we've got the John Emery Band, who is just amazing.
[01:39:35.342 --> 01:39:38.163]  I mean, they're the king of hillbilly rock and roll.
[01:39:38.263 --> 01:39:43.626]  And they were on this morning on another station playing a Toll Road song, and it was really awesome.
[01:39:44.068 --> 01:39:50.330]  And Jimmy played his, he's got another Toll Road song, which he played on another radio station.
[01:39:50.350 --> 01:39:52.090]  It was cool, so he's going to play that tonight, too.
[01:39:52.110 --> 01:39:54.391]  Yeah, this is going to be the fight of the new Toll Road songs.
[01:39:54.791 --> 01:39:59.392]  Oh yeah, this is where the Austin Tea Party made history.
[01:39:59.452 --> 01:40:00.692]  That's what's happening tonight.
[01:40:00.792 --> 01:40:04.873]  This is the Austin Toll Party, and you want to come and be part of this history.
[01:40:05.173 --> 01:40:10.634]  Alright, and for folks that missed any of the websites or phone numbers, go to InfoWars.com in the middle of the page down there.
[01:40:11.035 --> 01:40:12.635]  We've got the beautiful poster.
[01:40:13.475 --> 01:40:23.344]  Uh, promoting all of this and just in closing, Jimmy, I've always enjoyed seeing you out at events and I want to thank you for being involved and more prominent people got involved.
[01:40:23.664 --> 01:40:31.711]  I know we turned this country around, but more and more just grassroots citizens are getting involved and with your help and Sal's help I think we're going to be able to defeat this.
[01:40:32.623 --> 01:40:37.587]  No compromise with these toll roads is my opinion or any of these new taxes.
[01:40:38.028 --> 01:40:39.149]  They've got plenty of money.
[01:40:39.709 --> 01:40:42.752]  Jimmy, just in closing, anything else you'd like to add?
[01:40:42.772 --> 01:40:46.175]  Just thank you, Alex, for everything and all of them.
[01:40:46.295 --> 01:40:55.463]  And Sal, thank you and Linda Curtis and everybody for letting us know about this, letting me know about it, and I hope I can help all I can.
[01:40:56.281 --> 01:40:58.603]  I want to thank all the folks that have bought tickets and that are coming.
[01:40:59.063 --> 01:41:02.805]  Yeah, and we'll see you all tonight, and all the musicians that are coming down there.
[01:41:02.865 --> 01:41:04.866]  We're going to have a ball.
[01:41:05.587 --> 01:41:06.547]  It sounds like fun.
[01:41:06.587 --> 01:41:07.808]  I'm going to be there.
[01:41:07.828 --> 01:41:09.409]  I'll see you guys down there about 8 o'clock.
[01:41:10.529 --> 01:41:12.911]  God bless you, and I'll see you this evening, gentlemen.
[01:41:13.211 --> 01:41:13.731]  Thank you, folks.
[01:41:14.192 --> 01:41:14.512]  Take care.
[01:41:14.532 --> 01:41:14.712]  Bye.
[01:41:15.552 --> 01:41:16.553]  Alright, give them a call.
[01:41:16.573 --> 01:41:16.613]  512-371-9926.
[01:41:16.633 --> 01:41:16.693]  512-371-9926.
[01:41:16.813 --> 01:41:18.434]  I mean, it's fun fighting the New World Order.
[01:41:26.201 --> 01:41:28.664]  I mean, Jimmy, you know, he's come out the first time I ever met him.
[01:41:28.684 --> 01:41:33.149]  He showed about three years ago for showing a road to tyranny to a sellout crowd.
[01:41:33.169 --> 01:41:35.271]  We turned away about 50 people.
[01:41:36.293 --> 01:41:38.035]  So, better get your tickets now, folks.
[01:41:39.156 --> 01:41:39.937]  That would be advisable.
[01:41:41.269 --> 01:41:47.815]  And at the same time, you see Jimmy out at Ron Paul speaking, you see him out there getting involved in his community like everybody else is.
[01:41:48.236 --> 01:41:50.718]  And we've got to make it exciting and fun to fight the New World Order.
[01:41:50.958 --> 01:41:51.839]  Because it is!
[01:41:51.919 --> 01:41:53.300]  Because we're the majority.
[01:41:53.521 --> 01:41:54.822]  We're the normal people.
[01:41:55.182 --> 01:41:56.563]  And we've got to start acting like it.
[01:41:56.844 --> 01:42:00.187]  Instead of hiding in our closets with our views about the New World Order.
[01:42:01.121 --> 01:42:02.522]  So, give them a call right now.
[01:42:02.542 --> 01:42:02.522]  512.
[01:42:02.562 --> 01:42:03.062]  Here's the number.
[01:42:03.082 --> 01:42:03.122]  512-371-9926.
[01:42:03.142 --> 01:42:03.182]  512-371-9926.
[01:42:03.202 --> 01:42:05.163]  I want their phones blown off the wall!
[01:42:05.183 --> 01:42:07.023]  I want their phone lines melting!
[01:42:15.715 --> 01:42:16.736]  And I want to commend my audience.
[01:42:16.756 --> 01:42:25.021]  They've said that the vast majority of people calling in and getting tickets have been from this radio show and the websites and a lot of other folks out there.
[01:42:25.041 --> 01:42:28.744]  But we have that audience that really cares about freedom and is really getting involved.
[01:42:28.764 --> 01:42:30.005]  And I just love you guys to death.
[01:42:30.025 --> 01:42:30.065]  512-371-9926.
[01:42:34.375 --> 01:42:41.486]  I just heard about this a couple weeks ago, and I was planning to go, and they called me up and said, hey, we want you to come speak and introduce the band, and so I'm honored to do that.
[01:42:41.646 --> 01:42:45.372]  But to Austin, tollparty.com, or go through infowars.com, or 512-371.
[01:42:47.798 --> 01:42:48.038]  9-9-2-6.
[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:51.321]  Because I've looked at the Austin Toll Party.
[01:42:51.381 --> 01:42:52.682]  I watched them for about six months.
[01:42:52.722 --> 01:42:53.662]  Looked at what they were doing.
[01:42:53.982 --> 01:42:55.043]  They're full of good people.
[01:42:55.944 --> 01:42:56.884]  They're not infiltrated.
[01:42:56.924 --> 01:42:57.825]  They're not controlled.
[01:42:58.205 --> 01:42:59.966]  It's true grassroots activism.
[01:43:00.187 --> 01:43:02.008]  And believe me, USA Today has reported it.
[01:43:02.408 --> 01:43:03.229]  This is the model.
[01:43:03.269 --> 01:43:04.950]  It is coming to your city, your town.
[01:43:05.290 --> 01:43:11.254]  It's been, I've seen at least 20 states in the last few months that have introduced the accompanying legislation.
[01:43:11.852 --> 01:43:17.834]  We got the legislation right here in Texas, where a transponder in every single car attacks you with this.
[01:43:18.615 --> 01:43:23.176]  Alright, I've been ranting, but look, I won't be able to leave my neighborhood.
[01:43:23.496 --> 01:43:28.078]  There's one grocery store, a few restaurants, and a gas station I'll be able to go to.
[01:43:28.798 --> 01:43:29.919]  And then I run into toll roads.
[01:43:30.279 --> 01:43:32.360]  And you heard Jimmy, he lives in a whole other part of town.
[01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:34.201]  He won't be able to get out of his neighborhood.
[01:43:34.261 --> 01:43:40.443]  I mean, they've got these suckers designed where no matter where you live, and this is for all the cities in Texas,
[01:43:41.238 --> 01:43:46.663]  And Louisiana's about to pass it, California, New York, Ohio, New Jersey.
[01:43:46.723 --> 01:43:48.985]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on.
[01:43:49.525 --> 01:43:54.649]  They're talking about expanding the NAFTA corridor that goes up through Kansas, through Oklahoma, into Missouri.
[01:43:54.669 --> 01:43:58.373]  They're talking about putting toll roads in there for all of our Kansas City listeners.
[01:43:58.393 --> 01:44:03.297]  They're talking about toll roads in places, you know, unpopulated states like New Mexico.
[01:44:03.937 --> 01:44:04.598]  They're talking about it.
[01:44:04.618 --> 01:44:05.699]  I mean, it's everywhere!
[01:44:06.783 --> 01:44:07.063]  512-371-9926.
[01:44:07.083 --> 01:44:07.263]  512-371-9926.
[01:44:07.383 --> 01:44:13.187]  Or AustinTollParty.com.
[01:44:14.949 --> 01:44:16.370]  Or Pinky's Wireless around town.
[01:44:16.450 --> 01:44:18.291]  If you're driving by Pinky's Wireless, pull in and get it.
[01:44:18.311 --> 01:44:19.252]  Alright, let's go to the calls.
[01:44:19.292 --> 01:44:21.173]  I appreciate everybody holding for 45 minutes.
[01:44:21.513 --> 01:44:22.314]  Who's up next here?
[01:44:23.234 --> 01:44:23.875]  Fred in Philly.
[01:44:24.876 --> 01:44:25.576]  Fred, you're on the air.
[01:44:25.636 --> 01:44:26.016]  Go ahead.
[01:44:26.257 --> 01:44:26.677]  Hi, Alex.
[01:44:27.017 --> 01:44:27.497]  Hello, sir.
[01:44:27.698 --> 01:44:29.659]  It's been a while.
[01:44:29.799 --> 01:44:35.343]  I want to mention the role of those private companies with the toll roads because
[01:44:36.845 --> 01:44:44.774]  In your experience, has there been a transfer of ownership of any kind between a publicly owned road to a company?
[01:44:45.114 --> 01:44:51.761]  This is how the privatization scam works, and there's many different flavors of it, but this is how it works with the toll roads predominantly.
[01:44:52.242 --> 01:44:53.864]  They openly pay off the politicians.
[01:44:55.322 --> 01:44:57.223]  At the same time, they even put politicians in.
[01:44:57.243 --> 01:44:58.384]  This has been a ten-year program.
[01:44:58.404 --> 01:45:01.025]  They put all their politicians in, county, city, state level.
[01:45:01.306 --> 01:45:04.708]  Then the feds also say, no highway funds unless you start doing this.
[01:45:04.988 --> 01:45:19.316]  So the feds apply pressure, and then your existing major roads, that have been there in some cases for a hundred years, are handed over to private companies to administer it, and then they can charge whatever they want and make pure profit off of it.
[01:45:20.077 --> 01:45:23.519]  I think that that could be challenged as far as
[01:45:24.945 --> 01:45:45.366]  uh... the the uh... giving away of public assets with highway what do you think you're right but look there's other other roads that we've got the toll roads terminated in the state because it's illegal they're doing something that violates federal and state law every day but has that ground been used to challenge it that you can't involve
[01:45:46.542 --> 01:45:50.824]  a person or I mean a company to own a road that was a public road.
[01:45:50.964 --> 01:45:52.464]  They're arguing they don't own it.
[01:45:52.484 --> 01:45:53.784]  They're administering it for the state.
[01:45:53.804 --> 01:45:54.465]  Oh, I get it.
[01:45:55.865 --> 01:45:56.645]  Okay, that's it.
[01:45:57.026 --> 01:45:57.406]  Thank you.
[01:45:57.906 --> 01:45:58.546]  Thanks for the call.
[01:45:58.626 --> 01:45:59.726]  It's disgusting.
[01:46:00.887 --> 01:46:03.027]  Let's talk to Harry in Canada.
[01:46:03.067 --> 01:46:03.708]  Harry, go ahead.
[01:46:04.508 --> 01:46:05.108]  Oh, he hung up.
[01:46:06.108 --> 01:46:06.789]  Jim in Ohio.
[01:46:06.829 --> 01:46:07.469]  Go ahead, Jim.
[01:46:07.609 --> 01:46:07.769]  Hi, Alex.
[01:46:07.789 --> 01:46:08.329]  How are you doing?
[01:46:08.529 --> 01:46:08.749]  Good.
[01:46:09.729 --> 01:46:11.490]  Quick question and a comment first.
[01:46:11.530 --> 01:46:14.371]  Please correct this statement if you believe it to be false in any way.
[01:46:14.861 --> 01:46:25.671]  The United States is a global corporation, controlled by the British Crown, owned by the Vatican, and governed by a myriad of laws unconstitutionally written by treasonous lawyers for elite banking interests.
[01:46:27.103 --> 01:46:29.545]  Everything but the Vatican part.
[01:46:29.605 --> 01:46:31.327]  I mean, the Vatican's definitely involved in it.
[01:46:32.107 --> 01:46:35.370]  But from my research, they lost a lot of power in the last 300 years.
[01:46:36.151 --> 01:46:37.172]  And they're certainly involved.
[01:46:37.212 --> 01:46:40.795]  They own some big banks and are part of the New World Order.
[01:46:40.835 --> 01:46:45.239]  The Vatican definitely has been, but I wouldn't say that it's the... I wouldn't say it's owned by the Vatican.
[01:46:45.259 --> 01:46:47.000]  I would say owned by British banks.
[01:46:47.180 --> 01:46:48.662]  So we can drop that.
[01:46:48.702 --> 01:46:54.647]  Now, getting to that part, this is another example of the hypocrisy
[01:46:55.143 --> 01:46:55.884]  Of this government.
[01:46:56.124 --> 01:46:59.466]  The national debt is about to turn $8 trillion.
[01:47:00.767 --> 01:47:01.548]  How can this happen?
[01:47:01.568 --> 01:47:03.049]  Sir, that's what they tell you in the news.
[01:47:03.569 --> 01:47:06.871]  It was $65 trillion.
[01:47:07.292 --> 01:47:09.913]  The Dallas Morning News two years ago admitted $43 trillion.
[01:47:09.933 --> 01:47:11.054]  Are you serious?
[01:47:11.314 --> 01:47:11.815]  Wow.
[01:47:11.855 --> 01:47:13.356]  No, folks, Dallas Morning News, $43 trillion.
[01:47:13.616 --> 01:47:15.998]  But again, those numbers are wrong.
[01:47:16.058 --> 01:47:17.038]  It's much larger.
[01:47:18.399 --> 01:47:23.443]  Look, they're counting an $8 trillion debt as for what is owed right now.
[01:47:24.571 --> 01:47:36.136]  Okay, it's like, this month I owe my house, I owe, you know, $1,100 or whatever, I owe that money this month, but the note that I owe, you know, is hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[01:47:36.496 --> 01:47:37.657]  So see, this is how it works.
[01:47:37.797 --> 01:47:43.319]  Our actual, what they've agreed to, the obligations, are over $60 trillion.
[01:47:43.982 --> 01:47:45.443]  How could they pass a bankruptcy bill?
[01:47:47.344 --> 01:47:50.546]  But see, notice, as soon as you start making money, they don't send you credit cards anymore.
[01:47:50.826 --> 01:47:54.948]  As soon as you're out of debt, or don't have a bunch of debt, you don't get credit cards every week.
[01:47:55.248 --> 01:48:01.692]  Back when I was a poor, starving college student eating ramen noodle five days a week, I got credit cards almost every day.
[01:48:02.032 --> 01:48:06.955]  Well, didn't you tell us last week that a company actually cancelled you because you weren't profitable to them?
[01:48:07.195 --> 01:48:07.455]  Yes.
[01:48:07.535 --> 01:48:11.417]  You paid your card off every... Yeah, they just, after a year, they said, we're cancelling you.
[01:48:11.437 --> 01:48:12.178]  And I called, they said, well,
[01:48:12.884 --> 01:48:15.925]  And they said, it's actually bad for your credit, Mr. Jones, if you pay everything.
[01:48:16.265 --> 01:48:17.945]  They said, there's a ratio we look at.
[01:48:18.406 --> 01:48:23.187]  So I got a bad credit score, a bad mark, too, in there because I pay my bills.
[01:48:23.367 --> 01:48:24.627]  How dare you pay your bills on time?
[01:48:25.788 --> 01:48:39.432]  What all this does, what I'm talking about, the high gas prices, which in turn put up all the consumer goods, the toll roads, inflation, what they're succeeding in doing is pulling more and more dollar bills out of circulation.
[01:48:40.072 --> 01:48:40.772]  And that is
[01:48:41.502 --> 01:48:49.664]  Going to lead to more of the depression and allow them to push through their things when people start riding just for a bite to eat?
[01:48:50.665 --> 01:48:53.886]  Well, actually what they're doing is they're radically inflating the currency right now.
[01:48:54.946 --> 01:48:58.947]  And because the currency is getting more and more worthless, that's why oil prices have gone up.
[01:48:59.890 --> 01:49:06.693]  Any chance on the website, you know on the left side there, where you have all the things, the skull and bones, the cremations, all that.
[01:49:06.853 --> 01:49:12.295]  Could we get a section on there that deals strictly with the government documents, the white papers that you talk about?
[01:49:12.924 --> 01:49:15.606]  Yeah, those are all over the site, but it's a good place to put them.
[01:49:15.706 --> 01:49:21.250]  And I've told Duke Lordley, that's Paul's nickname, over in England to do that.
[01:49:21.270 --> 01:49:22.171]  He's so busy, though.
[01:49:22.531 --> 01:49:24.953]  But yeah, there's a lot of sections we want to build, a lot of things we want to do.
[01:49:25.213 --> 01:49:25.954]  Send him emails.
[01:49:26.034 --> 01:49:26.834]  Recommend it to him.
[01:49:27.155 --> 01:49:27.415]  Very good.
[01:49:27.475 --> 01:49:28.115]  Okay, thanks Alex.
[01:49:28.395 --> 01:49:29.837]  You'll have to go to the Crown for that.
[01:49:30.617 --> 01:49:31.278]  Joking, folks.
[01:49:31.298 --> 01:49:32.098]  I like to tease Paul.
[01:49:33.099 --> 01:49:33.639]  We listen.
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:35.561]  Alright.
[01:49:36.521 --> 01:49:37.983]  I'm teasing because it's over in England.
[01:49:38.043 --> 01:49:39.404]  Everybody must be Lordley over there.
[01:49:40.304 --> 01:49:41.205]  We love our British listeners.
[01:49:41.670 --> 01:49:42.970]  We have a huge audience in England.
[01:49:43.551 --> 01:49:44.351]  I want to say hi to them.
[01:49:44.371 --> 01:49:47.272]  I'll be right back, folks.
[01:49:48.132 --> 01:49:49.172]  Pass the lime juice.
[01:49:53.814 --> 01:49:58.155]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.335 --> 01:50:02.776]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.896 --> 01:50:07.297]  There is a chance to use this disaster with a New World Order.
[01:50:07.377 --> 01:50:08.678]  A New World Order.
[01:50:09.438 --> 01:50:10.199]  Panama.

[01:52:57.732 --> 01:53:01.434]  I just called the Austin Toll Party during the break and they said their phones are ringing off the hooks.
[01:53:01.494 --> 01:53:02.014]  That's good.
[01:53:03.615 --> 01:53:04.956]  We want you to come down tonight.
[01:53:05.916 --> 01:53:07.437]  And I'll plug that again in the next hour.
[01:53:08.357 --> 01:53:09.538]  Tunes, not tolls.
[01:53:11.799 --> 01:53:13.740]  We've actually gotten some calls asking what the number is.
[01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:14.480]  So here it is again.
[01:53:14.501 --> 01:53:14.541]  512-371-9926.
[01:53:14.561 --> 01:53:14.601]  512-371-9926.
[01:53:22.478 --> 01:53:25.081]  Let's just go back to your calls and I'll continue with the news in the next hour.
[01:53:25.701 --> 01:53:27.143]  But the calls are always interesting.
[01:53:27.944 --> 01:53:32.068]  Let's talk to Jason and Marilyn and Brock, Ruben, James and others.
[01:53:32.108 --> 01:53:32.849]  Go ahead, Jason.
[01:53:33.630 --> 01:53:43.600]  Alex, I was wondering, I was curious, I'm a big fan of Jimmy and Stevie Ray Vaughan and I was curious if, I think that it's a great thing they're doing.
[01:53:43.920 --> 01:53:45.041]  Do you know if there's any other
[01:53:46.263 --> 01:53:56.985]  You know, activist names, you know, musicians like Bob Geldof or Willie Nelson or Ted Nugent who understand what's happening and are doing anything about it.
[01:53:58.165 --> 01:54:01.786]  I think I heard Ted Nugent's against the open borders and has been supporting the Minutemen.
[01:54:02.946 --> 01:54:05.887]  Well, these people, they should use their power.
[01:54:07.507 --> 01:54:10.828]  Well, that's not their job, but civically it is because they're getting involved.
[01:54:12.648 --> 01:54:15.629]  You know, speaking out, but it's all of our responsibilities.
[01:54:15.889 --> 01:54:16.349]  Of course.
[01:54:17.229 --> 01:54:18.869]  But some of us are blessed.
[01:54:18.889 --> 01:54:19.970]  There's so many people.
[01:54:20.230 --> 01:54:24.591]  There's so much music coming out now of every genre that's exposing the New World Order.
[01:54:24.991 --> 01:54:25.951]  It's very exciting.
[01:54:26.811 --> 01:54:33.793]  Well, the other thing I had was I was curious if you had heard that Joseph Ratzinger, the new Pope,
[01:54:34.498 --> 01:55:00.002]  uh... was uh... in the Hitler Youth or the uh... Yes, now that's admitted, he was in the Hitler Youth and he helped uh... cover up some of the uh... scandals in the church concerning pedophilia and uh... according to my uh... conservative catholic sources he's a mason and new world order yeah and also apparently uh... has his hands in the death of the pope prior to uh... John Paul
[01:55:01.354 --> 01:55:11.638]  I have some very good sources that wish to go unnamed at this time, but I've been doing research on the subject the last few days, and that's what I've also gotten about Ratzinger.
[01:55:11.718 --> 01:55:14.279]  But the media calls him conservative, so he must be conservative.
[01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:15.940]  Of course.
[01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:20.482]  Well, I was calling, hoping to talk to Jimmy, but it's just as well to talk to you.
[01:55:20.562 --> 01:55:26.144]  I thank everybody who's doing their part, and, you know, let's stop it.
[01:55:26.184 --> 01:55:27.084]  Let's do what we can.
[01:55:28.064 --> 01:55:28.545]  I hear you.
[01:55:28.565 --> 01:55:29.185]  Thanks for the call.
[01:55:30.502 --> 01:55:32.963]  Let's uh... I've just got to plug my video.
[01:55:33.023 --> 01:55:39.466]  I mean I've got to do it at least one minute an hour and then we'll go back to Brock and Reuben and James and everybody else that's holding.
[01:55:40.626 --> 01:55:44.548]  First off, the toll free number to join us on air on this live Thursday edition is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:55:44.588 --> 01:55:51.751]  And my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State, is three films in one.
[01:55:51.811 --> 01:55:55.773]  It covers the police state, the latest 9-11 information, and who the order of death
[01:55:56.525 --> 01:56:01.086]  Who the Globalists really are, the secret society that is on top of all the secret societies.
[01:56:02.427 --> 01:56:03.547]  They're Luciferians.
[01:56:04.467 --> 01:56:08.168]  They believe the Devil is God, the Angel of Light, the Brotherhood of Light.
[01:56:09.308 --> 01:56:12.409]  But they believe they serve the darkness for the light.
[01:56:12.429 --> 01:56:14.490]  A bunch of mumbo-jumbo.
[01:56:15.090 --> 01:56:17.991]  But they funded Hitler, they funded Bohemian Grove, Skull and Bones.
[01:56:18.411 --> 01:56:19.651]  You need to have this film.
[01:56:19.691 --> 01:56:20.791]  It covers so much.
[01:56:21.231 --> 01:56:22.212]  It's my best work.
[01:56:22.392 --> 01:56:23.552]  Please get it!
[01:56:25.008 --> 01:56:29.769]  $25.95, but as I said, three hours on DVD, two and a half plus hours on VHS.
[01:56:30.409 --> 01:56:34.550]  And when you get a second copy, it's $19.95, and it just keeps going down in price the more videos you get.
[01:56:34.970 --> 01:56:36.431]  All my other films are excellent as well.
[01:56:36.451 --> 01:56:37.851]  I've got discounts on those right now.
[01:56:38.291 --> 01:56:49.994]  Go to infowars.com to order the new film or any of the films via the Safe Secure Online Shopping Cart, to watch free video clips of the films, to read about the different specials, and then to order them.

[01:56:59.961 --> 01:57:01.022]  Takes about a minute and a half to do.
[01:57:01.382 --> 01:57:02.342]  Watch all my films.
[01:57:02.382 --> 01:57:02.943]  Read my book.
[01:57:03.043 --> 01:57:04.464]  Paul Watson's excellent book.
[01:57:05.885 --> 01:57:06.925]  A bunch of other videos.
[01:57:06.965 --> 01:57:08.046]  My weekly TV reports.
[01:57:08.086 --> 01:57:08.626]  It's all there.
[01:57:08.706 --> 01:57:09.407]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:57:10.285 --> 01:57:10.745]  TV.
[01:57:11.265 --> 01:57:22.929]  Or call toll free to order 1-888-253-3139.
[01:57:22.949 --> 01:57:23.669]  888-253-3139.
[01:57:24.169 --> 01:57:24.709]  Don't wait.
[01:57:24.769 --> 01:57:25.349]  Get the film.
[01:57:25.389 --> 01:57:26.029]  Make copies.
[01:57:26.470 --> 01:57:27.630]  It's having a massive effect.
[01:57:27.670 --> 01:57:28.410]  I want to commend you.
[01:57:29.670 --> 01:57:31.251]  And folks, my last name's Jones.
[01:57:32.451 --> 01:57:35.432]  So, I'm allowed to tease Paul Watson about being English.
[01:57:35.772 --> 01:57:36.832]  Because that's an English name.
[01:57:36.852 --> 01:57:37.573]  It's really Welsh.
[01:57:38.053 --> 01:57:38.813]  Oh, that was a joker.
[01:57:50.178 --> 01:57:50.839]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.479 --> 01:57:52.540]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.260 --> 01:57:54.321]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.998 --> 01:57:55.859]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.579 --> 01:57:58.500]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.520 --> 01:58:01.822]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.323 --> 01:58:06.485]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.645 --> 01:58:21.014]  Alright, my friends, we are now into hour number three.
[01:58:21.855 --> 01:58:23.676]  The Senate is on the verge
[01:58:25.294 --> 01:58:32.880]  of passing a national ID card bill that expands the existing national ID card legislation into a Pan American ID card.
[01:58:34.221 --> 01:58:38.384]  It also will make you have it to have jobs and a lot, lot more.
[01:58:38.424 --> 01:58:39.805]  It is very, very serious.
[01:58:40.405 --> 01:58:42.107]  I want to get into that a little bit here.
[01:58:42.127 --> 01:58:46.390]  Greenspan warns rising deficits endanger economy.
[01:58:47.831 --> 01:58:58.195]  And he says the economy could risk stagnation or worse, but the government keeps telling us how great the economy is with the stock market plunging a couple hundred points, or 150 points every day.
[01:58:59.736 --> 01:59:00.336]  It's scary.
[01:59:00.616 --> 01:59:02.216]  It's scary to see all of this happening.
[01:59:02.256 --> 01:59:11.980]  Meanwhile, trillions are missing from the Pentagon, and our government commitments are actually over 60 trillion dollars, but the government's not worried about that.
[01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:17.022]  No, they want to make the American people have special transponder chips in their
[01:59:17.478 --> 01:59:19.179]  In their passports.
[01:59:19.859 --> 01:59:21.840]  Up in New Hampshire, they're fighting at red light cameras.
[01:59:21.880 --> 01:59:23.481]  I love this article on ABC News.
[01:59:23.561 --> 01:59:25.062]  Smile, you're on Canada's cop camera.
[01:59:25.482 --> 01:59:26.143]  We're going to get into that.
[01:59:26.523 --> 01:59:28.124]  Rumsfeld to quit this summer.
[01:59:29.244 --> 01:59:32.666]  Also, Bersaloni resigns as Italian Prime Minister.
[01:59:32.726 --> 01:59:36.888]  People are so mad at him about lying about the Iraq War and WMD.
[01:59:38.009 --> 01:59:41.731]  A senior Blair aide resigns over Iraq War as well and says it's all a lie.
[01:59:43.363 --> 01:59:47.847]  And we'll also get into some of the things that Collier was just mentioning.
[01:59:48.107 --> 01:59:49.808]  Here's one of the Toll Road articles.
[01:59:50.248 --> 01:59:54.632]  Satellites to track cars and tax them by the mile via tolls.
[01:59:55.733 --> 01:59:58.595]  But I want to go a little bit over Ratzinger, because people keep calling in about it.
[01:59:58.655 --> 02:00:01.017]  The surge to victory, Cardinal's death steps.
[02:00:01.417 --> 02:00:02.938]  How he did it from the Herald Tribune.
[02:00:03.299 --> 02:00:07.342]  Then Ratzinger and pedophilia in the church.
[02:00:08.274 --> 02:00:19.164]  And another one here, New Pope shelt sex abuse claim accuser says, and out of the Associated Press, Israel praises Pope despite Nazi past.
[02:00:19.905 --> 02:00:22.267]  Well yeah, they praise Arnold despite Nazi past.
[02:00:23.168 --> 02:00:25.930]  Your real live Nazi connections, you're A-OK.
[02:00:25.950 --> 02:00:27.792]  You fight Nazis, you'll be listed as a Nazi.
[02:00:28.374 --> 02:00:28.894]  Immediately.
[02:00:29.334 --> 02:00:35.417]  And John Bolton, another mentally unstable megalomaniac, a great article by Paul Watson.
[02:00:35.437 --> 02:00:42.540]  We're also reading and reporting that Rumsfeld seals the deal on military bases to launch an attack on Iran.
[02:00:42.580 --> 02:00:46.362]  In fact, I'll cover that first when we get back after this quick break.
[02:00:46.622 --> 02:00:48.963]  But right now, let's go to your phone calls!
[02:00:50.843 --> 02:00:55.886]  Up next here is Reuben in Ohio.
[02:00:55.906 --> 02:00:56.686]  Reuben, go ahead.
[02:00:59.332 --> 02:00:59.952]  Hello, Reuben.
[02:01:00.212 --> 02:01:00.633]  Hi, Alex.
[02:01:01.013 --> 02:01:01.293]  Hello.
[02:01:01.553 --> 02:01:03.174]  Hey, your show is double-plus good.
[02:01:03.774 --> 02:01:04.274]  Oh, yes.
[02:01:05.294 --> 02:01:05.695]  Thank you.
[02:01:05.955 --> 02:01:08.256]  I'm going to keep firing off until you cut me off, okay?
[02:01:09.196 --> 02:01:12.537]  First of all, there's a band, if you're not familiar with them, they're called System of a Down.
[02:01:12.797 --> 02:01:13.598]  Yes, I'm familiar.
[02:01:13.938 --> 02:01:16.199]  Okay, do you like them?
[02:01:16.439 --> 02:01:17.019]  Are you into them?
[02:01:17.719 --> 02:01:18.799]  I've heard it on the radio.
[02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:20.100]  It's pretty good music.
[02:01:20.320 --> 02:01:21.461]  No, I mean their lyrics.
[02:01:21.481 --> 02:01:23.301]  Yeah, it's Antonio World Order.
[02:01:23.641 --> 02:01:31.425]  Okay, so you're down with that because I've heard people call up your show and they recommend you have a guest and the next thing you know that person's a guest on your show.
[02:01:31.505 --> 02:01:33.005]  So, here I go.
[02:01:33.165 --> 02:01:43.389]  It's just hard getting really popular bands on because they're bothered by so many people already that it's hard to get through their managers and people.
[02:01:43.810 --> 02:01:44.350]  Okay, I understand.
[02:01:44.370 --> 02:01:45.610]  Generally, they have to come to you.
[02:01:45.630 --> 02:01:46.631]  Oh, I see.
[02:01:48.295 --> 02:01:55.839]  Up here in the Cleveland area, we used to have a Youngstown Congressman named Jim Traficant, who's in... Yeah, they put him in prison for no reason.
[02:01:56.940 --> 02:01:58.821]  You feel they put him in prison for no reason?
[02:01:59.181 --> 02:02:00.202]  You just said that, obviously.
[02:02:00.242 --> 02:02:07.126]  But I came across some of his speeches on thememoryhold.com, and it just blew me away how vocal and outspoken that guy was.
[02:02:07.166 --> 02:02:07.606]  Well, I'm outspoken.
[02:02:07.626 --> 02:02:08.627]  I'll hold you over if need be.
[02:02:08.947 --> 02:02:10.227]  They didn't put him in jail for no reason.
[02:02:10.247 --> 02:02:12.409]  They put him in jail because he was exposing the New World Order.
[02:02:12.729 --> 02:02:13.209]  Oh, okay.
[02:02:13.549 --> 02:02:14.370]  See, because, I mean,
[02:02:15.307 --> 02:02:20.569]  The, uh, if you ask anybody up here, they say, oh, he's tied with the mafia, he was taking money.
[02:02:20.709 --> 02:02:24.271]  I mean, they buy the whole story of, uh, that he was corrupt.
[02:02:24.951 --> 02:02:31.554]  And I, I read the history of Congress only had, they only kicked two people out of Congress for criminal crimes in their whole history.
[02:02:31.574 --> 02:02:33.015]  And one of them was Jim Traffickin.
[02:02:34.336 --> 02:02:35.276]  It's pure garbage.
[02:02:36.637 --> 02:02:37.477]  It's nice to hear that.
[02:02:38.698 --> 02:02:39.238]  Anything else?
[02:02:39.858 --> 02:02:41.479]  Yeah, I got a few more other things.
[02:02:41.539 --> 02:02:41.879]  All right.
[02:02:42.859 --> 02:02:45.200]  Come back to you, you're making good points.
[02:02:45.540 --> 02:02:47.060]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:47.260 --> 02:02:50.341]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:50.481 --> 02:02:54.363]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:54.403 --> 02:02:58.664]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:02:59.004 --> 02:03:02.765]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:02.905 --> 02:03:04.706]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:04.926 --> 02:03:08.209]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[02:03:08.249 --> 02:03:12.973]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:13.133 --> 02:03:16.176]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:03:16.356 --> 02:03:19.218]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:03:19.699 --> 02:03:25.824]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:26.344 --> 02:03:30.146]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:03:45.896 --> 02:03:46.656]  Terrorism!
[02:03:46.756 --> 02:03:52.800]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[02:03:53.061 --> 02:03:54.642]  Alarming words for our time!
[02:03:54.882 --> 02:03:57.383]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:03:57.764 --> 02:04:12.353]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:12.373 --> 02:04:12.714]  government.

[02:04:50.949 --> 02:04:52.010]  You wear deodorant, right?
[02:04:52.130 --> 02:04:53.011]  Well, let's hope you do.
[02:04:53.111 --> 02:04:55.954]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[02:04:56.154 --> 02:05:01.019]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[02:05:01.279 --> 02:05:02.360]  Check out this new product.
[02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:03.641]  It's called No B.O.

[02:05:05.783 --> 02:05:07.865]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No B.O.
[02:05:07.905 --> 02:05:09.467]  to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.

[02:05:17.493 --> 02:05:20.615]  She also knows that while you want it all natural, you want it very effective.
[02:05:20.736 --> 02:05:26.140]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.

[02:05:45.496 --> 02:05:50.540]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.880 --> 02:05:53.162]  Because there's a war on through your mind.
[02:05:55.382 --> 02:05:59.966]  Rumsfeld seals the deal on military bases to launch attack on Iran.
[02:05:59.986 --> 02:06:04.790]  But right now, let's go back to the caller.
[02:06:05.450 --> 02:06:08.433]  Reuben in Ohio had some more important questions and comments.
[02:06:09.033 --> 02:06:09.754]  Go ahead, Reuben.
[02:06:10.475 --> 02:06:11.075]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:06:11.135 --> 02:06:17.360]  I was filling out my taxes, and there's a line that says the child tax credit, and I get more money back when I fill that out.
[02:06:17.681 --> 02:06:18.681]  Do you know anything about that?
[02:06:18.721 --> 02:06:24.066]  Because them putting the word credit in there makes me feel like they're gonna hold something over me.
[02:06:24.784 --> 02:06:25.724]  Is that double-speak?
[02:06:26.024 --> 02:06:26.624]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:06:26.844 --> 02:06:30.725]  No, that's just the name of the bill the conservatives decades ago lobbied for.
[02:06:31.265 --> 02:06:31.825]  Not a tramp?
[02:06:33.486 --> 02:06:39.287]  Well, people could argue anything, but your child's got to have a social security number to get that.
[02:06:39.827 --> 02:06:40.787]  Okay, yeah, I understand.
[02:06:40.807 --> 02:06:42.487]  They do use it for tracking data, yeah.
[02:06:43.247 --> 02:06:53.469]  Okay, I was wondering... They already know that, so if you're going to be paying those taxes at the Federal Reserve, that's where you write your checks to, by the way, then, well, you know that, right?
[02:06:54.492 --> 02:06:56.993]  Um... Pastor of the Federal Reserve.
[02:06:58.853 --> 02:06:59.213]  Go ahead.
[02:06:59.513 --> 02:07:00.593]  Okay, sorry.
[02:07:00.773 --> 02:07:05.274]  I just wanted to know if that was some type of trap or not, but it's just regular, it's a regular trap like anything else.
[02:07:05.754 --> 02:07:10.255]  Okay, in Martial Law, you showed the Communist Revolutionary Youth?
[02:07:10.976 --> 02:07:11.256]  Yes.
[02:07:11.556 --> 02:07:12.716]  I ran into some of them.
[02:07:13.836 --> 02:07:22.738]  Michael Moore came to speak in Kent, and I went there wearing a Vote for Ralph Nader shirt, even though I was voting Libertarian, because they won't let him on the ballot.
[02:07:23.177 --> 02:07:26.380]  And I actually got to see Jim Mars and talk to him for a couple hours.
[02:07:26.840 --> 02:07:31.764]  But, um, it surprised me to see those communists in your film.
[02:07:32.244 --> 02:07:40.771]  They looked and acted identical to the communists I ran into outside Michael Moore's speaking, and they gave me this newspaper.
[02:07:40.811 --> 02:07:43.753]  I paid a dollar for it, you know, because I'm always open to new views and whatnot.
[02:07:44.254 --> 02:07:49.338]  Their newspaper is complete garbage and mindless propaganda.
[02:07:49.438 --> 02:07:52.340]  I don't know who the Bob Kavakian is, or whatever that guy's name is.
[02:07:53.554 --> 02:07:57.536]  It's just amazing how they were just clones of the youth in your movie.
[02:07:58.897 --> 02:08:07.382]  Well, look, we didn't set out... Really, I said, we're going to New York and whatever we run into that's interesting is going to be in this film.
[02:08:07.502 --> 02:08:13.886]  Because normally I set out to make a film on one subject or on a group of subjects, but I know what I'm going to do beforehand.
[02:08:13.926 --> 02:08:19.709]  I said, we're going to go to New York and so whatever we run into that's interesting, we'll tell that story and show it.
[02:08:20.130 --> 02:08:22.371]  We only spent about four minutes on the Communists, but
[02:08:23.627 --> 02:08:32.153]  We're just peacefully walking along and comment on their sign that, you know, Bush and Kerry are controlled and the Communists are controlled and it's all controlled.
[02:08:32.953 --> 02:08:37.757]  And so they start cussing at us and getting in our face and... And they wish you would die.
[02:08:38.157 --> 02:08:40.178]  And I said, I said, Stalin killed 50 million people.
[02:08:40.218 --> 02:08:41.579]  She said, too bad he didn't kill you.
[02:08:41.899 --> 02:08:42.120]  Yeah.
[02:08:42.260 --> 02:08:43.340]  I wish he would have killed you.
[02:08:44.221 --> 02:08:50.765]  And then I see another group of the same Communists, you know, same affiliation, different group, and I walk over nicely and I go, I'd like to interview you.
[02:08:50.785 --> 02:08:51.546]  What are your views?
[02:08:52.495 --> 02:08:53.876]  And, you know, just get away from us.
[02:08:55.337 --> 02:09:00.720]  So, it is... Look, folks, the big banks, it's public knowledge, funded the communists.
[02:09:01.341 --> 02:09:02.882]  People go, why would they do that?
[02:09:03.342 --> 02:09:06.864]  Because they want centralized control to enslave the middle class.
[02:09:08.205 --> 02:09:10.066]  I mean, look at big corporations today.
[02:09:10.426 --> 02:09:13.208]  They make most of their money off of socialized government.
[02:09:13.888 --> 02:09:15.169]  It's socialized for us.
[02:09:15.209 --> 02:09:16.610]  The profits are then given to them.
[02:09:16.950 --> 02:09:18.331]  They're above our countries.
[02:09:18.371 --> 02:09:19.352]  They're international.
[02:09:20.825 --> 02:09:27.408]  They'd love to have us all under communism, with a big global government run by corporations above it, extracting our wealth!
[02:09:29.029 --> 02:09:29.549]  Anything else?
[02:09:29.909 --> 02:09:31.770]  Okay, one last thing, I'll let you go.
[02:09:32.510 --> 02:09:35.832]  First of all, have you actually read the 9-11 Commission Report?
[02:09:36.932 --> 02:09:38.093]  Yes, I read part of it.
[02:09:38.393 --> 02:09:42.174]  Well, stuff like that that is mindless, I'll read when I'm on the exercise bike.
[02:09:42.635 --> 02:09:44.355]  But yes, I did scan over it.
[02:09:44.615 --> 02:09:48.497]  It's full of lies, it's full of truth, it's full of half-truths.
[02:09:48.797 --> 02:09:50.318]  They mix it all in.
[02:09:50.976 --> 02:09:59.243]  Well, I noticed they spend a little bit of time on the actual tax and a great deal of amount of time on algorithms, biometric scanning.
[02:09:59.283 --> 02:10:00.765]  No, no, no.
[02:10:01.385 --> 02:10:05.049]  They said when they first started the commission, the so-called independent commission.
[02:10:05.089 --> 02:10:10.453]  Now look, if I'm accused of murder and the judge is my father, is that an independent court?
[02:10:10.674 --> 02:10:11.114]  Not at all.
[02:10:11.334 --> 02:10:13.336]  Okay, well, Bush appointed the court.
[02:10:14.102 --> 02:10:16.923]  Half of them are in business with the Bin Ladens of the Carlisle Group.
[02:10:17.163 --> 02:10:18.043]  That's mainstream news.
[02:10:18.263 --> 02:10:25.806]  They tried to have Hare Kissinger, codenamed The Boar, they tried to have him be the first chairman.
[02:10:27.827 --> 02:10:34.669]  So, at the start of the commission, they said, we're not going to assess blame on anybody, we're just going to study solutions.
[02:10:35.484 --> 02:10:40.768]  And they said before they even started the commission, it's going to be national ID card, biometrics, checkpoints.
[02:10:41.309 --> 02:10:43.371]  And then when they have the ruling, what is it?
[02:10:43.451 --> 02:10:44.551]  Exactly what they said it'd be.
[02:10:46.913 --> 02:10:47.654]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:10:47.694 --> 02:10:49.375]  We need to pass Patriot Act 2.
[02:10:49.756 --> 02:10:51.197]  We need national ID cards.
[02:10:51.237 --> 02:10:52.618]  We need to give all our rights up.
[02:10:54.720 --> 02:10:56.922]  We need a continental security perimeter.
[02:10:57.722 --> 02:11:00.384]  We need to have an intelligence czar over everything.
[02:11:00.424 --> 02:11:03.287]  We need to give the CIA the right to arrest citizens.
[02:11:05.034 --> 02:11:06.135]  You've read it, that's what's in there.
[02:11:06.155 --> 02:11:09.938]  Thanks for the call, Ribbon.
[02:11:10.298 --> 02:11:11.159]  Brock in Canada.
[02:11:11.219 --> 02:11:11.919]  Brock, go ahead.
[02:11:12.340 --> 02:11:12.980]  Hi, Alex.
[02:11:13.260 --> 02:11:13.581]  Hello.
[02:11:13.821 --> 02:11:18.764]  I'm just thinking that 65 trillion, that is the point of no return.
[02:11:18.845 --> 02:11:20.566]  It's going, going, gone.
[02:11:20.646 --> 02:11:22.287]  That will never be recovered.
[02:11:22.787 --> 02:11:31.094]  Is this partly why America's going into third world countries and others to confiscate their resources?
[02:11:31.994 --> 02:11:33.896]  Here's the parallel or the analogy.
[02:11:35.518 --> 02:11:40.460]  Let's say I'm a mob boss, a capo, under a Don.
[02:11:42.501 --> 02:11:49.964]  And I've got a whole crew of people, former prize fighters, you name it, that work for me, that go beat people up that don't pay their percentage to me.
[02:11:51.225 --> 02:11:56.887]  Well, most of those guys I've got working for me, got into debt for me ten years ago.
[02:11:57.407 --> 02:11:58.508]  So they're my slaves too.
[02:11:59.388 --> 02:12:03.310]  And so America is now a slave, captured by this global crime syndicate.
[02:12:04.102 --> 02:12:23.409]  Being used as an engine, a puppet, a shill, a marionette, a drone, a robot to go out and smash and kill and take over and then we take the blame and the international banks sit around bad-mouthing our government for doing what it's being ordered to do by them.
[02:12:24.835 --> 02:12:30.177]  And then it makes the Euro look good, it makes Europe look good, it makes all these other countries that are owned by the same people look good.
[02:12:30.197 --> 02:12:39.080]  It gives us the illusion of choice like there's some type of bipolar world or tripolar world going on out there when it's monopolar.
[02:12:39.240 --> 02:12:52.244]  It's one group owns and runs it all and they wage war against the population to further consolidate so no one can threaten their global hegemony and monopoly over resources and ideas and human beings.
[02:12:53.465 --> 02:12:53.585]  And
[02:12:54.421 --> 02:13:04.939]  And yes, and that's why the Federal Reserve sets the policies that have caused all this, and then Greenspan comes out and says, oh, we're going to be in deep trouble soon.
[02:13:05.678 --> 02:13:11.400]  Oh, you know, we're going to stagnate or even worse, we're going to basically have a depression, as Ron Paul's been saying.
[02:13:11.900 --> 02:13:23.905]  Let's see, Ron Paul's been giving us solutions all along to stop the Federal Reserve that set these policies, but the very people that bring us into these crises then come right before there's a big problem and say, oh, there's going to be a problem!
[02:13:24.125 --> 02:13:26.386]  Do what we say when something bad happens!
[02:13:29.287 --> 02:13:31.248]  Does that answer your question?
[02:13:31.969 --> 02:13:39.293]  Well, yeah, and the other tie-in, I guess, is the Nazi connection to the New World Order and these high-level masons.
[02:13:39.313 --> 02:13:41.074]  Do they have a culture of death?
[02:13:41.134 --> 02:13:41.694]  Do they not?
[02:13:41.734 --> 02:13:45.676]  Do they not want to reduce the world population?
[02:13:45.696 --> 02:13:46.696]  They love it!
[02:13:46.857 --> 02:13:47.457]  It's what they do.
[02:13:48.137 --> 02:13:51.839]  And I would suggest that there's going to be a lot more of that happening.
[02:13:53.480 --> 02:14:00.964]  Probably more diseases inflicted upon Africa and other nations to reduce population to
[02:14:02.085 --> 02:14:05.187]  Just to suit their ends, because all they are is about death.
[02:14:05.667 --> 02:14:10.791]  Nazis love death, and high-level masons, they love destruction and death.
[02:14:10.851 --> 02:14:11.391]  Do they not?
[02:14:11.631 --> 02:14:12.152]  Yes, they do.
[02:14:12.172 --> 02:14:12.912]  Thanks for the call.
[02:14:12.932 --> 02:14:15.674]  They believe destruction is the first element of creation.
[02:14:17.215 --> 02:14:19.377]  They get really mad if you let those secrets out.
[02:14:19.817 --> 02:14:21.378]  And again, most masons aren't bad.
[02:14:21.398 --> 02:14:23.019]  They're low-level, compartmentalized.
[02:14:23.059 --> 02:14:24.920]  They get very angry if you tell them this stuff.
[02:14:25.281 --> 02:14:26.401]  They're not high-level.
[02:14:26.722 --> 02:14:28.623]  They think 33rd degree is the highest.
[02:14:30.473 --> 02:14:31.333]  It's like the cops.
[02:14:31.393 --> 02:14:32.754]  It's like bureaucrats.
[02:14:32.794 --> 02:14:33.834]  It's like corporate people.
[02:14:34.375 --> 02:14:35.755]  Well, I just run a corporation.
[02:14:35.795 --> 02:14:39.077]  I'm just a mid-level executive and I just do my job.
[02:14:41.818 --> 02:14:43.399]  These corporations are not free market.
[02:14:43.439 --> 02:14:46.380]  They operate as governmental crime entities.
[02:14:48.761 --> 02:14:51.442]  And their PR is slick, but people are seeing through it.
[02:14:51.682 --> 02:14:53.503]  Once you see through it, it doesn't matter how slick it is.
[02:14:54.606 --> 02:14:57.287]  Let's go ahead and talk to James in Canada.
[02:14:57.307 --> 02:14:59.208]  It's the Invasion of the Canadians.
[02:14:59.508 --> 02:14:59.848]  James?
[02:15:00.548 --> 02:15:01.508]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:15:01.848 --> 02:15:03.909]  I say that because I've got a bunch of other Canadians online.
[02:15:04.369 --> 02:15:05.289]  Good, James, how you doing?
[02:15:05.670 --> 02:15:07.370]  Not bad.
[02:15:07.530 --> 02:15:13.072]  I've got your new Martial Laws video and I showed it to all my friends, but we downloaded it and it came on MPEG format.
[02:15:13.452 --> 02:15:16.313]  I know you say it's on DVD9 if we were to order it from you.
[02:15:16.860 --> 02:15:20.641]  And that the listeners need a DVD-9 recorder to record it and share it.
[02:15:20.681 --> 02:15:27.942]  The reason I call in for that is because I like to give it out to everyone, but not everyone can watch it on MPEGs on their DVD player or on their computer.
[02:15:28.463 --> 02:15:32.103]  And I just wanted to let you know they have a program that's called DVD Shrink.
[02:15:32.904 --> 02:15:38.905]  And that's a freeware program if you just type it in, and that will take a DVD-9 and you can put it onto a single-layer DVD then.
[02:15:40.034 --> 02:15:41.795]  And that'll have all the extras and everything.
[02:15:42.215 --> 02:15:42.575]  Good!
[02:15:42.615 --> 02:15:43.755]  We're interested in that.
[02:15:43.855 --> 02:15:48.697]  Well, what I don't want you to do is go to a file sharing network and name Marshall Law.
[02:15:48.757 --> 02:15:50.557]  Yeah, Fahrenheit 9-11.
[02:15:50.597 --> 02:15:51.718]  No, no, no.
[02:15:51.778 --> 02:15:56.979]  Don't name it Star Wars Revenge of the Sith.
[02:15:57.239 --> 02:16:01.081]  Because then people will think it's a pre-release and tens of millions will go watch it.
[02:16:01.121 --> 02:16:02.181]  Don't do that, okay?
[02:16:02.241 --> 02:16:02.821]  Don't do that.
[02:16:02.981 --> 02:16:04.302]  I'll try.
[02:16:04.602 --> 02:16:04.922]  I'll try.
[02:16:05.587 --> 02:16:08.749]  Also, I'm up here in Ontario and we have a pit bull ban now.
[02:16:08.869 --> 02:16:11.571]  And I thought that was kind of like the gun control thing, you know?
[02:16:11.591 --> 02:16:16.335]  But now they are banning pit bulls and we can't have them in Ontario without a muzzle.
[02:16:16.355 --> 02:16:17.075]  Which is ridiculous.
[02:16:17.115 --> 02:16:19.036]  Pit bulls are not mean and of themselves.
[02:16:19.116 --> 02:16:20.217]  It's how they're raised.
[02:16:20.557 --> 02:16:22.519]  By scum that beat them and fight them.
[02:16:23.319 --> 02:16:29.543]  And they don't even have any records of what dogs do the biting when they have the records of all this stuff.
[02:16:29.563 --> 02:16:32.726]  They don't know what dog bit the person or anything.
[02:16:32.746 --> 02:16:33.626]  Well, here's the problem.
[02:16:33.646 --> 02:16:34.527]  Statistically,
[02:16:35.834 --> 02:16:41.458]  Statistically, for just biting, it's Cocker Spaniels, but they don't hurt you.
[02:16:41.778 --> 02:16:48.023]  Then after that, it's German Shepherds, and Australian Cattle Dogs, and Dobermans.
[02:16:48.063 --> 02:16:52.486]  The problem is, when a pit or a bull mastiff attacks, a lot of times it kills.
[02:16:53.347 --> 02:16:54.288]  That's what it's bred to do.
[02:16:55.108 --> 02:16:57.730]  But no, they shouldn't restrict your pit bulls.
[02:16:58.190 --> 02:16:58.911]  I don't have a pit bull.
[02:16:59.191 --> 02:17:03.074]  I have a full-size Boston Terrier, and these idiots always think it's a pit bull.
[02:17:03.929 --> 02:17:06.310]  Uh, they think everything's a pitbull, Bobster, everything.
[02:17:06.690 --> 02:17:17.816]  And these guys, they're putting this law, this law goes into effect now, uh, takes place on August 28th, but the guys in the park, the Park Rex guys and the police officers are telling you they're gonna have to leave the park on April 28th.
[02:17:18.723 --> 02:17:27.188]  And the law says that it takes effect on August 29th, and then within that you have 16 days until October 28th to comply with the law.
[02:17:27.208 --> 02:17:28.008]  But that's part of it.
[02:17:28.068 --> 02:17:30.830]  They like to practice laws that don't exist.
[02:17:30.850 --> 02:17:31.370]  Thanks for the call.
[02:17:31.910 --> 02:17:37.994]  It's how they set illegal, unlawful, illegitimate, fraudulent precedents.
[02:17:39.274 --> 02:17:39.795]  We'll be back.
[02:17:40.295 --> 02:17:43.477]  I'll cover Rumsfeld seals the deal on military bases for war.
[02:17:45.842 --> 02:17:53.807]  Did you know that sugar, that sweet and simple, inoffensive-looking, refined substance you use in your coffee and cupcakes actually reduces your body's ability to protect you?
[02:17:54.207 --> 02:17:55.468]  It suppresses your immune system!
[02:17:55.668 --> 02:17:56.348]  Now check this out.
[02:17:56.708 --> 02:18:00.130]  The average American consumes 2 to 3 pounds of sugar on average each week.
[02:18:00.451 --> 02:18:02.572]  That's about 120 pounds of sugar per year!
[02:18:03.092 --> 02:18:05.756]  Do you know what happens when your immune system is compromised?
[02:18:06.016 --> 02:18:06.797]  Your health suffers.
[02:18:07.057 --> 02:18:07.678]  It's that simple.
[02:18:08.019 --> 02:18:09.821]  Here's how you can help your body win the fight.
[02:18:09.981 --> 02:18:11.984]  With the dietary supplement, Agaricus Bio.
[02:18:12.424 --> 02:18:20.355]  The dietary supplement, Agaricus Bio, was developed so that you can fight back again and again by giving your immune system a chance to be the first line of defense it was meant to be.

[02:18:46.989 --> 02:18:51.493]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:18:51.833 --> 02:18:55.936]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:18:56.216 --> 02:18:56.757]  We listened.
[02:18:57.077 --> 02:19:02.061]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:19:02.341 --> 02:19:02.822]  We listened.
[02:19:03.202 --> 02:19:06.244]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:19:06.665 --> 02:19:07.205]  We listened.
[02:19:07.666 --> 02:19:10.708]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[02:19:10.708 --> 02:19:11.349]  We're good to go.
[02:19:37.548 --> 02:19:47.375]  Be a part of the new gold rush.
[02:19:47.816 --> 02:19:52.139]  You know, for thousands of years, the one true valuable commodity has always been gold.
[02:19:52.539 --> 02:19:53.440]  It still is!
[02:19:54.020 --> 02:19:57.523]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[02:19:57.843 --> 02:19:59.644]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[02:20:00.204 --> 02:20:02.246]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[02:20:02.805 --> 02:20:04.827]  Protect yourself in these uncertain times.
[02:20:05.207 --> 02:20:12.874]  With the stock market on the skins, and really, nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.
[02:20:13.254 --> 02:20:17.037]  And that's gold, silver, and other rare and valuable coins and precious metals.

[02:20:51.138 --> 02:20:58.723]  Diametics, the leading authority on polychromatic infrared diode therapy in the U.S., now offers its patented Paynex 2000 to the public.
[02:20:58.803 --> 02:21:05.429]  The Paynex 2000 uses the same technology NASA uses aboard the space shuttle, and the same technology used by the Navy SEALs.
[02:21:05.629 --> 02:21:06.990]  Now it's available to you.
[02:21:07.150 --> 02:21:13.695]  The Paynex 2000 is FDA cleared for joint aches and pains, increases circulation, and relaxes those achy muscles.
[02:21:13.955 --> 02:21:18.258]  Diametics has literally written the book on polychromatic infrared diode therapy.
[02:21:18.538 --> 02:21:24.801]  Using five different wavelengths in the Paynex 2000 has made it the most advanced infrared light therapy product on the market today.

[02:21:43.091 --> 02:21:58.335]  Alright, I've got to calm down, slow down here and cover some news.
[02:21:58.375 --> 02:21:59.575]  We'll come back and take calls.
[02:22:00.835 --> 02:22:05.176]  Rumsfeld seals the deal on military bases to launch attack on Iran.
[02:22:06.177 --> 02:22:07.837]  And this is an article by Paul Watson.
[02:22:09.204 --> 02:22:14.985]  What was the purpose of Donald Rumsfeld's visit to Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan last week?
[02:22:15.645 --> 02:22:20.926]  There was no official statement on the agenda of the meetings with top Azerbaijani government officials.
[02:22:22.246 --> 02:22:37.029]  But the very next day, the commander of NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces in Europe, General Johns, issued a statement from local press saying the US had planned to deploy military bases in the Caspian region to order
[02:22:39.312 --> 02:22:50.403]  In order to ensure regional security, Azerbaijan is seen as one of the launchpads for launching an attack on Iran, which some see as coming as early as June.
[02:22:53.297 --> 02:23:01.665]  Deal was already done, but tied up and Rumsfeld's visit was simply part of the finalization process.
[02:23:02.205 --> 02:23:09.332]  Russian news analyst websites expressed concern with the deal, fearing it could escalate the likelihood of a US-Russian confrontation.
[02:23:09.812 --> 02:23:15.758]  Russia is an ally of Iran and sees the Caspian as its own stomping ground.
[02:23:17.520 --> 02:23:18.781]  And a week before
[02:23:20.268 --> 02:23:24.649]  Ariel Sharon came to Crawford, Texas to meet with Bush, and it was a war summit.
[02:23:25.470 --> 02:23:32.892]  It was leaking, but it was in preparation for an attack on Iran, and that did then come out of the meeting.
[02:23:35.173 --> 02:23:43.576]  And we had Ariel Sharon running around, waving at the media his supposed photos of the nuclear sites.
[02:23:44.376 --> 02:23:47.417]  Well, yeah, they're nuclear sites, peaceful nuclear sites.
[02:23:49.033 --> 02:23:54.398]  They've allowed the IAEA, the United Nations inspectors, in there like no other country's done.
[02:23:54.418 --> 02:23:56.640]  And they are purely peaceful.
[02:23:57.801 --> 02:23:58.521]  Unabated.
[02:23:58.581 --> 02:24:04.887]  If they had everything they needed, it would take Iran five years to develop nuclear weapons.
[02:24:06.308 --> 02:24:07.970]  But our government isn't worried about that.
[02:24:11.212 --> 02:24:14.015]  Because facts don't matter to them.
[02:24:15.023 --> 02:24:20.524]  They can sit there and lie and propagandize all day and all night, and a lot of people will buy it.
[02:24:21.044 --> 02:24:25.545]  They're using the same rhetoric they used when it came to attacking Iraq, now with Iran.
[02:24:25.905 --> 02:24:29.285]  Meanwhile, they've helped give the bomb to Pakistan.
[02:24:30.746 --> 02:24:33.186]  They don't care about North Korea or China or Russia.
[02:24:33.686 --> 02:24:36.587]  None of those countries are threats to them.
[02:24:37.047 --> 02:24:39.767]  They're only worried about countries that do not have the bomb.
[02:24:40.427 --> 02:24:41.568]  Because they're pushovers.
[02:24:41.628 --> 02:24:43.388]  Because they're easy targets.
[02:24:43.688 --> 02:24:44.248]  That's why.
[02:24:46.314 --> 02:24:53.678]  And it holds no water, and I have no idea how people could even buy any of this propaganda.
[02:24:54.759 --> 02:24:57.360]  Meanwhile, Japanese fighters scramble over China.
[02:25:00.041 --> 02:25:14.149]  Japan has scrambled its military fighters 13 times due to China in the past year, compared with once or twice in each of the past five years, showing the deterioration of ties between the neighbors, officials' figures showed Wednesday.
[02:25:15.268 --> 02:25:22.732]  And now for the first time since World War II, Japan is building back up its military and saying they may be offensive to be defensive.
[02:25:24.353 --> 02:25:26.014]  Very, very serious.
[02:25:26.355 --> 02:25:28.756]  All over the world we see an escalation.
[02:25:29.958 --> 02:25:35.262]  Meanwhile, it's coming out that Donald Rumsfeld may resign this summer.
[02:25:35.602 --> 02:25:46.010]  That's what the White House said right after the re-election in November, that Rumsfeld will probably stay on about six months, and six months is just a few months away.
[02:25:46.851 --> 02:25:47.311]  The U.S.
[02:25:47.371 --> 02:25:52.936]  News and World Report Washington Whisper section is reporting that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld will quit in late summer.
[02:25:54.097 --> 02:25:58.400]  His rumored replacement is fellow neocon Secretary of State Richard Armitage.
[02:26:00.126 --> 02:26:12.184]  Rumsfeld has made more comebacks than Hulk Hogan from his WND lies to his implementation of the worldwide copper green torture policy.
[02:26:14.893 --> 02:26:18.676]  criminality and his ability to escape the rap knows no bounds.
[02:26:18.716 --> 02:26:22.559]  However, Washington Whispers credibility is in question.
[02:26:22.639 --> 02:26:37.070]  It was the source last year's pre-election terror attack story which just turned up to be more government fear-mongering as well as conditioning people that voting is a privilege afforded by government and not a constitutional right.
[02:26:38.382 --> 02:26:39.063]  Remember, it was U.S.
[02:26:39.103 --> 02:26:44.207]  News and World Report that said there would be nuclear attacks, there would be attacks, there would be martial law.
[02:26:44.387 --> 02:26:44.947]  They said it!
[02:26:44.987 --> 02:26:45.367]  We didn't!
[02:26:45.908 --> 02:26:47.529]  We said, this is fear-mongering, folks.
[02:26:47.829 --> 02:26:49.671]  The attacks come after the election.
[02:26:50.391 --> 02:26:54.354]  Berlusconi resigns as Italian Prime Minister.
[02:26:55.115 --> 02:27:01.000]  Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi has resigned, but says he will soon put together a new coalition.
[02:27:01.040 --> 02:27:06.364]  He told the upper house, the parliament, that his party had a mandate to lead until 2006, and it would do so.
[02:27:07.026 --> 02:27:27.739]  President Carlo Azziglo Campi asked him to stay as a caretaker Prime Minister, urging talks with allies, but Mr. Berlusconi's center-right coalition, Italy's longest-serving post-war government, was rocked by poor results in recent regional elections, tied to lies about weapons of mass destruction.
[02:27:28.379 --> 02:27:31.481]  See, they get in trouble over there, not over here.
[02:27:36.147 --> 02:27:39.153]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.075 --> 02:27:42.759]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:28:45.476 --> 02:28:51.741]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:28:51.861 --> 02:28:58.045]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:28:58.306 --> 02:29:06.692]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:29:06.992 --> 02:29:14.019]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:29:14.320 --> 02:29:19.165]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.

[02:29:53.436 --> 02:29:57.677]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:29:57.897 --> 02:30:04.939]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:05.319 --> 02:30:11.421]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:11.561 --> 02:30:12.781]  There are no side effects.
[02:30:13.121 --> 02:30:16.085]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.

[02:30:34.323 --> 02:30:34.584]  Call today.
[02:30:34.604 --> 02:30:35.664]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:30:35.684 --> 02:30:37.425]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:58.228 --> 02:31:00.530]  We're going to go back to your calls and back into news.
[02:31:00.550 --> 02:31:04.973]  We've got about, what, 26 minutes left on this Thursday edition.
[02:31:05.693 --> 02:31:22.305]  Don't forget, if you live anywhere in Texas and you've still got time to jump in the car and get down here, it kicks off at 7.30 tonight and goes until midnight, if not longer, in a big old ballroom up at the Doubletree Hotel off of I-35 in North Austin right by 290.
[02:31:24.500 --> 02:31:29.782]  And it's going to be Jimmy Vaughn and his band and a bunch of other Grammy Award winners.
[02:31:30.042 --> 02:31:32.463]  It's going to be really exciting.
[02:31:33.344 --> 02:31:37.626]  And I was invited to speak and introduce Jimmy at 10 o'clock tonight.
[02:31:38.586 --> 02:31:40.187]  So I'll be there as well.
[02:31:41.427 --> 02:31:43.688]  So please, come down.
[02:31:43.708 --> 02:31:44.869]  I really want to see you.
[02:31:45.029 --> 02:31:48.570]  And Jimmy and all the great musicians that are coming are doing this for free.
[02:31:49.490 --> 02:31:50.491]  They're doing it for free.
[02:31:52.339 --> 02:32:06.708]  So that the money from the tickets, the $20 to $30 per ticket, depending on how you get the tickets, will go to sue the government over these out-of-control toll roads on existing highways, and also to run candidates locally.
[02:32:07.829 --> 02:32:12.032]  And even USA Today admits, we are the national battleground.
[02:32:12.072 --> 02:32:13.493]  We are the front lines, folks.
[02:32:14.313 --> 02:32:15.734]  Right here in Texas for these toll roads.
[02:32:15.754 --> 02:32:16.975]  They're coming to a town near you.
[02:32:17.215 --> 02:32:19.737]  If they're able to do it here, they'll do it everywhere.
[02:32:22.086 --> 02:32:26.247]  7.30 tonight, DoubleTree kicks off and goes until after midnight.
[02:32:27.027 --> 02:32:28.567]  After midnight, that's right.
[02:32:29.787 --> 02:32:31.288]  It's going to be fun.
[02:32:31.308 --> 02:32:35.609]  You can give the Austin Toll Party a call and reserve your tickets there at the door.
[02:32:35.629 --> 02:32:35.669]  512-371-9926.
[02:32:35.689 --> 02:32:35.729]  512-371-9926.
[02:32:35.749 --> 02:32:38.549]  Or go to austintollparty.com or link through via infowars.com.
[02:32:38.589 --> 02:32:38.789]  Got the
[02:32:49.375 --> 02:32:51.096]  Got the concert poster there on the site.
[02:32:51.116 --> 02:32:52.177]  You can link through right there.
[02:32:52.718 --> 02:32:53.919]  AustinTollParty.com.
[02:32:54.719 --> 02:33:00.664]  And Pinky's Pagers, the biggest pager and cell phone shops here in Austin.
[02:33:00.684 --> 02:33:01.544]  They're all over the place.
[02:33:02.685 --> 02:33:05.047]  They're also selling them there as well.
[02:33:05.828 --> 02:33:10.031]  And there's some big ticket outfit that's got them too, but I forget the details of that.
[02:33:10.511 --> 02:33:15.515]  There's a lot of different places to get these, and they've sold a large percentage of the 2,000 tickets.
[02:33:17.165 --> 02:33:19.686]  So you'd be advised to get them while they're still there.
[02:33:20.026 --> 02:33:26.647]  Or to get there early, so you don't get turned away, because things like that can end up happening.
[02:33:27.308 --> 02:33:36.030]  And I don't want to... It's been implied that if there's any extra tickets and people can't afford $25 a ticket, that you might be able to get in there.
[02:33:36.070 --> 02:33:38.330]  But you want to support this, folks.
[02:33:38.830 --> 02:33:40.271]  So it's really, really important.
[02:33:40.291 --> 02:33:40.711]  512-371-9926.
[02:33:40.731 --> 02:33:40.771]  512-371-9926.
[02:33:46.189 --> 02:33:50.033]  And don't forget my new film Marshall Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State is out!
[02:33:51.655 --> 02:33:55.900]  And it's over three hours long on DVD, two and a half hours plus on VHS.
[02:33:56.741 --> 02:34:01.486]  And we've got a bunch of different specials on it if you get multiple copies of it or multiple copies of any of my films right now.
[02:34:02.162 --> 02:34:04.503]  As low as $5.95 for some of my videos.
[02:34:04.563 --> 02:34:05.763]  I just want to get them out to people.
[02:34:06.363 --> 02:34:08.463]  Or just get one copy of the film and make copies of it.
[02:34:08.803 --> 02:34:09.824]  Total free number to order.
[02:34:09.864 --> 02:34:11.504]  They can answer all your questions when you call.
[02:34:11.524 --> 02:34:19.286]  1-888-253-3139 Or watch my new film and all my films and a bunch of other great films.
[02:34:19.706 --> 02:34:23.267]  And my weekly TV reports, my book, Paul Watson's book, a bunch of other books.
[02:34:24.207 --> 02:34:27.308]  All online, 15 cents a day, monthly and yearly subscriptions.

[02:34:30.453 --> 02:34:31.814]  I'll give that out again briefly later.
[02:34:32.675 --> 02:34:34.897]  Let's go back to the calls here quickly.
[02:34:34.917 --> 02:34:37.079]  In fact, let's just blitz calls.
[02:34:37.239 --> 02:34:38.561]  Let's just blitz through calls.
[02:34:38.921 --> 02:34:41.043]  As soon as you hear somebody hang up, it's your chance to call in.
[02:34:41.063 --> 02:34:41.123]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:34:41.143 --> 02:34:41.964]  Mike in Florida, welcome!
[02:34:46.952 --> 02:34:52.518]  Hey Alex, listen, when dealing with these tolls, if everyone's against the tolls, will the politicians continue to do it?
[02:34:53.018 --> 02:35:02.768]  That tells me this absolutely reeks of Bilderberg policy, because that means whoever the fake left-right is that we're getting are the ones that are put in place because they have to pass the test.
[02:35:02.948 --> 02:35:07.953]  Aside from that, if I can just fire off, I guess I've been on, you know, I've been for a while, so I had a couple questions.
[02:35:09.764 --> 02:35:14.546]  What I want to say is, where do we find information on higher level masons?
[02:35:14.566 --> 02:35:17.288]  I always thought 33rd was the highest, that's what's advertised.
[02:35:17.368 --> 02:35:19.309]  Have you ever seen documents?
[02:35:19.729 --> 02:35:20.369]  Yes, I have.
[02:35:20.409 --> 02:35:22.330]  There are higher orders above that.
[02:35:23.330 --> 02:35:25.351]  And this is in Masonic documents.
[02:35:25.932 --> 02:35:27.512]  Okay, I guess that's what I'm asking.
[02:35:27.773 --> 02:35:30.574]  You know what, I'll have some experts on about it sometime and cover it.
[02:35:30.934 --> 02:35:31.434]  That sounds good.
[02:35:31.454 --> 02:35:34.036]  Okay, the last thing I want to do, because I know you're trying to go fast here.
[02:35:34.496 --> 02:35:39.118]  I live in Orlando, and right now, the entire area in Orlando right now is pulled, okay?
[02:35:39.962 --> 02:35:53.607]  For most people, it costs about $1,044 a year to go back and forth from work, and that's only using one of the major... It's going to be 1,855 smackers inside Austin per vehicle, and another $2,000 outside the city.
[02:35:53.907 --> 02:36:03.370]  Well, we have another road, on top of the four-way road I'm alluding to, we have another road called the 417, and that goes from 25 cent increments all the way to $1 or $2 total back and forth, okay?
[02:36:03.803 --> 02:36:08.506]  So, when you add that up, for the people that have to take the 408 and the 417, if you live in Orlando, you understand what I'm saying.
[02:36:08.526 --> 02:36:11.587]  You're paying probably around $2,000 a year already.
[02:36:11.607 --> 02:36:19.132]  And I've seen the master plans from the Orlando Expressway Authority to expand toll roads to roads that are typically free roads, like a US 27.
[02:36:19.712 --> 02:36:20.012]  I know!
[02:36:20.492 --> 02:36:23.214]  It's from, as I said, Florida, Louisiana, New Mexico.
[02:36:23.274 --> 02:36:23.874]  It's everywhere!
[02:36:23.914 --> 02:36:26.676]  I've seen, like, 20 states that have currently got bills to do it.
[02:36:26.936 --> 02:36:27.576]  Thanks for the call.
[02:36:27.637 --> 02:36:28.877]  And I just remembered something.
[02:36:29.498 --> 02:36:31.779]  David Michigan called at the end of the show yesterday.
[02:36:32.634 --> 02:36:35.477]  He wanted me to detail how the hijackers were government agents.
[02:36:37.118 --> 02:36:40.561]  And some other things about how they carried off 9-11 from the info I have.
[02:36:41.082 --> 02:36:43.464]  Then I said I'd do it this hour, and I just ran out of time.
[02:36:44.044 --> 02:36:45.966]  Dave, call me tomorrow during the first hour.
[02:36:46.026 --> 02:36:46.567]  Remind me.
[02:36:46.587 --> 02:36:50.110]  We're doing an Oklahoma City show tomorrow, but in the first hour I don't have any guests.
[02:36:50.790 --> 02:36:53.273]  And I will try to open the show up with that tomorrow.
[02:36:53.293 --> 02:36:54.614]  At least spend 20 minutes on it.
[02:36:55.675 --> 02:36:57.136]  So remind me folks tomorrow.
[02:36:57.196 --> 02:36:58.998]  I just remembered that I'd written a note here to do that.
[02:36:59.830 --> 02:37:01.931]  Yeah, no, it's nationwide, folks, okay?
[02:37:01.991 --> 02:37:03.652]  It's just that Texas is the testbed.
[02:37:03.672 --> 02:37:04.592]  They're doing it here first.
[02:37:05.413 --> 02:37:06.273]  Uh, good points, Mike.
[02:37:07.093 --> 02:37:08.734]  Uh, let's talk to Gabe in Canada.
[02:37:08.754 --> 02:37:09.555]  Gabe, go ahead.
[02:37:09.575 --> 02:37:10.295]  Yes, hi.
[02:37:10.655 --> 02:37:13.116]  I wanted to, uh, talk about the toll road that we have here.
[02:37:13.677 --> 02:37:13.937]  Yes.
[02:37:14.177 --> 02:37:19.659]  Uh, we had the same fiasco scam pulled and it was, uh, handed over to a private, uh, foreign corporation.
[02:37:20.400 --> 02:37:23.881]  If you think that it's going to be expensive to drive, do not have an accident on it.
[02:37:25.462 --> 02:37:25.862]  Oh, really?
[02:37:25.902 --> 02:37:26.362]  What happens?
[02:37:26.723 --> 02:37:27.623]  Oh, they'll send you a bill.
[02:37:28.483 --> 02:37:29.564]  If there's any damage to the highway.
[02:37:30.097 --> 02:37:35.909]  There was literally a story probably about three weeks ago about a woman who got a bill for $25,000 because she had an accident on the private highway.
[02:37:37.910 --> 02:37:38.891]  It's unbelievable.
[02:37:38.931 --> 02:37:40.792]  And these are roads we already paid for.
[02:37:40.852 --> 02:37:42.413]  The tax dot has plenty of money.
[02:37:42.453 --> 02:37:43.474]  It's their own documents.
[02:37:43.514 --> 02:37:46.116]  But the document says, don't show this to the public!
[02:37:46.556 --> 02:37:46.997]  That's right.
[02:37:47.297 --> 02:37:47.717]  Same thing.
[02:37:47.757 --> 02:37:49.999]  We paid for it with our tax dollars, and they sold it out.
[02:37:50.399 --> 02:37:51.360]  Well, it's like Russia.
[02:37:51.460 --> 02:37:56.084]  Communism supposedly ended, so they just gave everything to six oligarchs.
[02:37:56.404 --> 02:38:01.347]  It was also promised that it would be reasonable rates, and since the highway has been made private, it's gone up by over 200%.
[02:38:02.711 --> 02:38:06.555]  Well, they say out of the gate, we're talking a dollar a mile on some tolls.
[02:38:06.615 --> 02:38:07.296]  Folks, I'm not kidding.
[02:38:07.597 --> 02:38:21.172]  Yeah, and the other thing that they did here, but took a class action to make them stop, it was, I literally got a $10 interest thing on one of my bills because I was 50 cents short.
[02:38:21.312 --> 02:38:22.493]  Yeah, I didn't pay it on time.
[02:38:22.513 --> 02:38:22.754]  50 cents.
[02:38:24.840 --> 02:38:25.421]  Unbelievable.
[02:38:25.461 --> 02:38:26.161]  Thanks for the call.
[02:38:26.181 --> 02:38:27.763]  Thanks for holding so long to tell us that.
[02:38:27.783 --> 02:38:29.544]  It's important information, Gabe.
[02:38:29.564 --> 02:38:30.325]  Call back anytime.
[02:38:30.345 --> 02:38:31.686]  A lot of calls from Canada.
[02:38:32.527 --> 02:38:33.568]  Let's talk to Dana.
[02:38:33.588 --> 02:38:35.769]  Dana, where do you call us from?
[02:38:35.789 --> 02:38:36.590]  Seattle.
[02:38:36.910 --> 02:38:37.331]  Welcome.
[02:38:37.371 --> 02:38:38.412]  Seattle, Washington.
[02:38:38.452 --> 02:38:38.892]  Go ahead.
[02:38:38.912 --> 02:38:40.814]  Well, I'm originally a Texan.
[02:38:40.954 --> 02:38:44.517]  I lived there when you were raised there and I left six years ago.
[02:38:45.197 --> 02:38:46.539]  Well, good to have you back with us.
[02:38:47.339 --> 02:38:51.583]  I just wanted to... This is the first time I've ever talked on your station or even knew about it.
[02:38:52.225 --> 02:38:54.107]  I'm telling you, I've got the federal documents.
[02:38:54.207 --> 02:38:54.647]  It's simultaneous.
[02:38:54.667 --> 02:38:55.388]  Yes, I've seen
[02:39:12.521 --> 02:39:13.302]  It's more than that.
[02:39:13.362 --> 02:39:15.524]  I mean, every week I see new states.
[02:39:15.584 --> 02:39:16.424]  I see new bills.
[02:39:17.385 --> 02:39:18.346]  I haven't seen them for all 50.
[02:39:18.506 --> 02:39:20.988]  I know I've seen them for... It's really over 20.
[02:39:21.388 --> 02:39:22.649]  But I like to be conservative.
[02:39:22.849 --> 02:39:25.431]  When I guesstimate, I always average down.
[02:39:25.792 --> 02:39:28.494]  Dozens and dozens and masses of them.
[02:39:29.235 --> 02:39:33.438]  Well, to me, because I'm in my 50s, the big picture reminds me of Russia.
[02:39:34.198 --> 02:39:37.261]  And I remember as a kid studying and hearing about
[02:39:37.699 --> 02:39:40.300]  In Russia, you had a certain area you could live in.
[02:39:40.340 --> 02:39:42.581]  Otherwise, if you got out of that like a... That's it!
[02:39:42.681 --> 02:39:42.961]  Listen!
[02:39:43.061 --> 02:39:45.542]  And the trans-Texas corridors... You have to have passports and all kinds of stuff.
[02:39:45.762 --> 02:39:47.843]  The trans-Texas corridors is already like this.
[02:39:48.904 --> 02:39:49.364]  This is important.
[02:39:49.384 --> 02:39:49.944]  Let me just say this.
[02:39:50.704 --> 02:39:53.025]  The trans-Texas corridors that are already going up.
[02:39:53.085 --> 02:39:54.646]  I've been on them many times in Kansas.
[02:39:55.926 --> 02:39:56.707]  Up into Missouri.
[02:39:57.007 --> 02:39:58.707]  They blocked off all the little towns.
[02:39:58.747 --> 02:39:59.648]  You can't get off.
[02:40:00.248 --> 02:40:01.509]  And it turns them into ghost towns.
[02:40:01.549 --> 02:40:02.769]  And that's part of this plan.
[02:40:02.809 --> 02:40:03.189]  Go ahead.
[02:40:03.429 --> 02:40:07.331]  Well, that's what the original toll road between Dallas and Fort Worth has always been.
[02:40:07.970 --> 02:40:11.591]  You know, you get on that toll road, you can't get off until you get to Dallas or Fort Worth.
[02:40:12.952 --> 02:40:14.032]  You've been on that, haven't you?
[02:40:14.132 --> 02:40:20.274]  And now, yes, and now under Perry, they're going to take those other two roads that go there and make you pay with those and block those off.
[02:40:21.194 --> 02:40:22.315]  Well, I think it's scary.
[02:40:22.415 --> 02:40:25.015]  The New World Order is just coming too fast under Bush.
[02:40:25.556 --> 02:40:29.297]  Your caller did talk about the level of degrees of Masonic?
[02:40:29.397 --> 02:40:29.637]  Yes.
[02:40:30.424 --> 02:40:38.168]  There is a book I found, happened to find one before I left Texas in a used book store called Morals and Dogma, The Southern Jurisdiction.
[02:40:38.488 --> 02:40:41.409]  Written in 1878 by Albert Pike.
[02:40:41.789 --> 02:40:43.390]  No, that's the beginning of it.
[02:40:43.610 --> 02:40:48.333]  This edition was printed in 1925, but Pike is the one that started it.
[02:40:49.253 --> 02:40:51.754]  It is his stuff, but my edition was printed in 1925.
[02:40:51.814 --> 02:40:52.895]  Oh, you got it reprinted.
[02:40:52.955 --> 02:40:53.075]  Yeah.
[02:40:53.095 --> 02:40:53.915]  Whatever, same thing.
[02:40:54.095 --> 02:40:59.538]  But he can find out everything about it, and it is so parallel to the Mormon religion, it's scary.
[02:41:00.805 --> 02:41:04.768]  If you've ever looked into the Mormon religion, they really are with Masonic.
[02:41:05.709 --> 02:41:06.569]  Thanks for the call.
[02:41:07.290 --> 02:41:10.172]  Let's now go on to another caller here, hurrying through them.
[02:41:11.273 --> 02:41:13.815]  Let's talk to Jamie in Kentucky.
[02:41:13.855 --> 02:41:14.615]  Jamie, go ahead.
[02:41:14.835 --> 02:41:15.896]  Hey, Mr. Jones?
[02:41:16.076 --> 02:41:16.316]  Yes?
[02:41:17.237 --> 02:41:22.441]  I just want to say that I do feel it in my heart that the Lord is fixing that.
[02:41:22.661 --> 02:41:25.383]  You know, before this New World Order even happened,
[02:41:26.843 --> 02:41:32.747]  You know, they think they're in control, but they're really not.
[02:41:32.767 --> 02:41:33.987]  The Lord's in control.
[02:41:35.829 --> 02:41:37.129]  And He's going to keep us from this.
[02:41:37.490 --> 02:41:39.591]  Evil always falls of its own weight.
[02:41:39.911 --> 02:41:42.953]  Jimmy Vaughn told me a story on the telephone yesterday.
[02:41:42.973 --> 02:41:50.898]  He said that he heard another patriot tell the story.
[02:41:50.918 --> 02:41:55.801]  And it's God tells a man to go push on a boulder, push on a big rock.
[02:41:56.337 --> 02:41:58.338]  The man goes and pushes on it and it's not moving.
[02:41:58.698 --> 02:42:01.100]  The devil says to him, why'd God tell you to push on that rock?
[02:42:01.140 --> 02:42:01.740]  It's not moving.
[02:42:02.040 --> 02:42:04.581]  So the man goes back to God and he says, God, I'm pushing on the rock.
[02:42:05.082 --> 02:42:05.722]  It's not moving.
[02:42:05.742 --> 02:42:06.963]  And God said, I told you to push.
[02:42:07.783 --> 02:42:09.044]  Uh, I didn't tell you to move it.
[02:42:09.144 --> 02:42:09.764]  I'm going to move it.
[02:42:10.725 --> 02:42:13.066]  And, uh, Jimmy wanted to tell that story and never got around to it.
[02:42:13.146 --> 02:42:15.527]  So, uh, I told it for him, but... And Mr. Jones?
[02:42:15.767 --> 02:42:16.007]  Yes.
[02:42:16.227 --> 02:42:23.111]  Before I go here, I'd like to tell you that, uh, I was at church last night and I talked about the masonry and stuff, see?
[02:42:24.252 --> 02:42:24.652]  And, uh,
[02:42:25.470 --> 02:42:30.273]  I said, well, you know, they keep on, you know, don't want to agree with it and stuff.
[02:42:31.213 --> 02:42:34.535]  I said, well, see, there's this wife's husband.
[02:42:34.775 --> 02:42:35.456]  He's a Mason.
[02:42:35.536 --> 02:42:41.479]  I said, just go ahead and ask him, could you look at his book or, you know, whatever they call it.
[02:42:41.519 --> 02:42:42.439]  What do they call it now?
[02:42:43.340 --> 02:42:44.481]  The Bible or something?
[02:42:44.961 --> 02:42:45.261]  Yeah.
[02:42:46.061 --> 02:42:49.583]  Yeah, I told him, I told her, just look at that and you'll see.
[02:42:49.924 --> 02:42:52.225]  Because whoever's in it,
[02:42:53.143 --> 02:42:57.246]  And whoever, like, if they spread any word about it or anything secrecy?
[02:42:58.067 --> 02:42:59.768]  They swear an oath that they can be killed.
[02:42:59.948 --> 02:43:01.409]  Yeah, from ear to ear.
[02:43:01.429 --> 02:43:02.170]  That's right.
[02:43:02.190 --> 02:43:02.750]  Thanks for the call.
[02:43:02.790 --> 02:43:03.310]  Great points.
[02:43:04.631 --> 02:43:05.612]  Steven in Virginia.
[02:43:05.632 --> 02:43:06.333]  No, Vegas.
[02:43:06.353 --> 02:43:06.773]  Go ahead.
[02:43:09.355 --> 02:43:09.755]  Yes, okay.
[02:43:09.795 --> 02:43:10.095]  Thank you.
[02:43:10.115 --> 02:43:10.536]  Yes, sir.
[02:43:10.556 --> 02:43:11.056]  You're on the air.
[02:43:11.096 --> 02:43:11.476]  Go ahead.
[02:43:11.677 --> 02:43:11.897]  Thanks.
[02:43:11.937 --> 02:43:13.618]  Now, we're all asking the same question.
[02:43:13.638 --> 02:43:14.439]  It's interesting.
[02:43:14.899 --> 02:43:18.421]  So I'm going to ask it again to see if I can get you to give us some sort of insight here.
[02:43:18.982 --> 02:43:20.003]  What degree is above 33rd?
[02:43:21.960 --> 02:43:23.941]  Okay, there are different orders.
[02:43:24.001 --> 02:43:25.562]  There are 360 degrees.
[02:43:26.143 --> 02:43:29.405]  Humans can only go up into the 180s.
[02:43:29.585 --> 02:43:30.806]  It's debatable.
[02:43:31.146 --> 02:43:34.428]  Then there are actual goddesses and gods.
[02:43:34.468 --> 02:43:35.649]  They believe the devil is God.
[02:43:35.669 --> 02:43:37.570]  They don't believe in the whole Christian worldview.
[02:43:38.110 --> 02:43:48.476]  And Lucifer is at 360 degrees, or the sun, or the circumference, calculated into the sun's circumference calculation of 666.
[02:43:49.477 --> 02:43:49.797]  Got it.
[02:43:49.877 --> 02:43:50.698]  Okay, thank you very much.
[02:43:50.758 --> 02:43:52.599]  Now, give us the last question.
[02:43:52.639 --> 02:43:54.640]  If you'll give me the complete rundown on this new Pope.
[02:43:54.680 --> 02:43:56.601]  I've been getting bits and pieces.
[02:43:56.861 --> 02:44:01.523]  Kind of give us a litany of who is this guy and what's his upside, downside here.
[02:44:01.543 --> 02:44:10.708]  Okay, I wouldn't comment on Ratzinger until I researched it and talked to people that I know are true scholars and I even went right to conservative Catholics to get this information.
[02:44:11.469 --> 02:44:12.189]  He's a Mason.
[02:44:12.669 --> 02:44:17.812]  He was probably involved in Pope John Paul I's termination.
[02:44:19.649 --> 02:44:26.051]  He clearly was a Hitler Youth and he clearly did help cover up the pedophile scandal when it could have been stopped and cleaned up.
[02:44:27.852 --> 02:44:28.212]  Okay.
[02:44:28.232 --> 02:44:30.612]  And I'm not here... Thank you for the call, sir.
[02:44:30.873 --> 02:44:32.213]  I'm not here bashing Catholics.
[02:44:32.233 --> 02:44:35.014]  That's just what the conservative Catholics are saying.
[02:44:35.334 --> 02:44:36.614]  That's what's admitted about the guy.
[02:44:37.635 --> 02:44:40.775]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Eric in California.
[02:44:40.856 --> 02:44:41.516]  Eric, go ahead.
[02:44:41.776 --> 02:44:43.356]  Hey, thank you so much for having me on the show again.
[02:44:43.396 --> 02:44:45.257]  Hey, now with the toll roads, I'm going to go back to that.
[02:44:45.557 --> 02:44:48.958]  Now, excuse me for being ignorant, but what
[02:44:49.918 --> 02:44:54.420]  What negative effect will toll roads have on this country?
[02:44:54.440 --> 02:45:00.722]  Because in California alone, we have, I know, a toll road where all it does is reduce the amount of traffic that we have.
[02:45:00.762 --> 02:45:05.244]  That's from, it's in the area of Miramar where the Marine Corps Air Station is.
[02:45:05.264 --> 02:45:07.125]  Sir, sir, there's different types of toll roads.
[02:45:07.505 --> 02:45:10.606]  Building a new road and charging a toll for it is one thing.
[02:45:11.127 --> 02:45:12.767]  And then after it's paid off, it's no longer a toll.
[02:45:12.947 --> 02:45:14.088]  Okay, like Coronado Road.
[02:45:14.128 --> 02:45:17.029]  Taking existing roads, all the lanes,
[02:45:17.828 --> 02:45:19.490]  And making you pay to use them.
[02:45:20.071 --> 02:45:22.194]  On average about 30 cents a mile.
[02:45:22.935 --> 02:45:23.716]  This is incredible.
[02:45:24.545 --> 02:45:27.827]  Number one, the government says they need to do this because they don't have as much oil revenue.
[02:45:28.047 --> 02:45:32.029]  We're using 20 million barrels a day instead of 15 million barrels a day as we were six, seven years ago.
[02:45:32.309 --> 02:45:33.890]  They're getting more oil revenue than ever.
[02:45:34.150 --> 02:45:37.091]  We have the state agencies and federal agencies' numbers.
[02:45:37.131 --> 02:45:38.352]  They've got plenty of money.
[02:45:38.812 --> 02:45:43.835]  They're scamming you and it's a transponder that tracks you by name every place you go and what you do.
[02:45:44.035 --> 02:45:49.137]  They'll also automatically ticket you when you speed from transponder reader to transponder reader.
[02:45:49.518 --> 02:45:51.979]  It is totally un-American and it's existing roads.
[02:45:52.685 --> 02:46:05.893]  I mean, it's just like, in order to stop this, we have to go straight to the legislature, because if this is happening, I really doubt, and I'm not trying to be pessimistic, but it's like, even if we try to do it in a civil manner, do you think we can get much done?
[02:46:05.993 --> 02:46:07.034]  We are getting a lot done.
[02:46:07.054 --> 02:46:08.174]  We're already defeating it.
[02:46:08.355 --> 02:46:09.175]  No one is for it.
[02:46:09.215 --> 02:46:10.096]  It's totally criminal.
[02:46:10.136 --> 02:46:10.816]  Thanks for the call.
[02:46:10.956 --> 02:46:11.216]  Thank you.
[02:46:11.336 --> 02:46:11.937]  We're gonna win.
[02:46:11.957 --> 02:46:12.597]  Who's up next?
[02:46:16.700 --> 02:46:17.720]  Nick in North Carolina.
[02:46:17.760 --> 02:46:18.421]  Go ahead, Nick.
[02:46:19.321 --> 02:46:20.182]  Hey, how you doing today?
[02:46:20.242 --> 02:46:20.582]  Good, sir.
[02:46:21.386 --> 02:46:26.514]  Alex, I just first want to say I think you are the quintessential person that's leading this movement.
[02:46:26.875 --> 02:46:30.380]  You are single-handedly opening the eyes of all Americans.
[02:46:30.420 --> 02:46:31.482]  It is happening right now.
[02:46:31.602 --> 02:46:32.363]  I'm doing nothing.
[02:46:32.403 --> 02:46:33.505]  You're taking actions.
[02:46:33.665 --> 02:46:34.487]  That's why it's happening.
[02:46:34.989 --> 02:46:35.649]  Well, you're right.
[02:46:35.689 --> 02:46:37.910]  This isn't about you, but I just thank you so much.
[02:46:38.030 --> 02:46:39.670]  You are our brother.
[02:46:40.050 --> 02:46:58.675]  I just want to say quickly, yesterday I was flipping through the news channels, the daily propaganda I saw on Fox News, the nuclear intentions segment where they talked about al-Zarqawi obtaining a suitcase nuke, and I just thought it was very ironic that they're going to come right out and tell the American people to get ready.
[02:46:59.135 --> 02:47:00.075]  Get ready, America.
[02:47:00.115 --> 02:47:02.416]  Get ready for the suitcase nuke.
[02:47:02.476 --> 02:47:03.836]  We can't get al-Zarqawi, but
[02:47:04.336 --> 02:47:05.837]  He found a suitcase nuke.
[02:47:05.857 --> 02:47:07.138]  I don't know who makes these nukes.
[02:47:07.519 --> 02:47:10.581]  I assume that those people who make them are very sophisticated.
[02:47:10.601 --> 02:47:11.001]  The Russians.
[02:47:11.141 --> 02:47:14.063]  Al Zakhari is a government agent, just like Bin Laden.
[02:47:14.103 --> 02:47:15.124]  It's all staged.
[02:47:16.545 --> 02:47:17.126]  Absolutely.
[02:47:17.246 --> 02:47:21.109]  And they are certainly setting up the police state of total enslavement.
[02:47:21.249 --> 02:47:22.570]  The border is wide open.
[02:47:22.590 --> 02:47:23.250]  Thanks for the call.
[02:47:23.530 --> 02:47:24.631]  Who's up next after him?
[02:47:25.972 --> 02:47:26.773]  Coy in Missouri.
[02:47:26.813 --> 02:47:27.573]  Go ahead, Coy.
[02:47:27.593 --> 02:47:30.696]  Coy, you're on the air.
[02:47:32.017 --> 02:47:32.337]  Okay.
[02:47:33.231 --> 02:47:34.692]  Charles in Texas, you're up next.
[02:47:34.732 --> 02:47:35.473]  Go ahead, Charles.
[02:47:36.073 --> 02:47:39.116]  Hey, yeah, a lot of people talk about masonry today.
[02:47:39.376 --> 02:47:42.258]  I think that the Vatican is very much involved with masonry.
[02:47:42.318 --> 02:47:45.200]  If you look at the upper echelon... Well, it's been taken over by it.
[02:47:45.620 --> 02:47:46.141]  You think so?
[02:47:46.401 --> 02:47:46.641]  Yes.
[02:47:47.362 --> 02:47:52.726]  If you look at the rules, the rituals, the regalia of the upper level of masonry, it's almost identical.
[02:47:52.746 --> 02:47:58.270]  It's like the Knights of Malta and the Knights of Columbus with the cocktails and the swords and all that stuff they use in the rituals.
[02:47:59.901 --> 02:48:05.824]  And also, have you ever had Eustace Mullins or Eric John Phelps on the show?
[02:48:06.364 --> 02:48:07.644]  I've had Eustace Mullins on.
[02:48:09.545 --> 02:48:11.226]  Have you ever thought about having him on again?
[02:48:11.766 --> 02:48:17.229]  Yes, other people interview him and it's funny, I've called and asked for the number and they just won't give it to me.
[02:48:17.709 --> 02:48:18.409]  Okay, thank you.
[02:48:18.929 --> 02:48:22.451]  If somebody gives me Eustace's number, I know he was in a nursing home for a while and he's back out.
[02:48:22.891 --> 02:48:25.072]  I'd like to interview Eustace, so email me his phone number.
[02:48:25.592 --> 02:48:26.493]  It's strange, I ask.
[02:48:27.631 --> 02:48:29.812]  To call a fellow patriot with a number, you know, they wouldn't give it to me.
[02:48:30.292 --> 02:48:31.192]  Well, that's fine.
[02:48:31.753 --> 02:48:32.353]  Uh, listen.
[02:48:32.613 --> 02:48:33.813]  Final segment coming up.
[02:48:33.853 --> 02:48:34.574]  That's it for calls.
[02:48:34.594 --> 02:48:37.055]  I know we got loaded lines, but that's all we have time for.
[02:48:37.175 --> 02:48:39.696]  Some final comments and information on the other side.
[02:48:39.736 --> 02:48:42.577]  And I'll see you tonight at Tunes, not Tolls!
[02:48:45.858 --> 02:48:50.220]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.400 --> 02:48:54.742]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:56.738 --> 02:48:59.360]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.380 --> 02:49:02.263]  The New World Order can emerge.
[02:49:02.503 --> 02:49:06.727]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.787 --> 02:49:13.733]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.853 --> 02:49:15.855]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.095 --> 02:49:26.722]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:26.842 --> 02:49:32.246]  If you want to understand what the new old order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:49:32.746 --> 02:49:36.649]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:49:36.669 --> 02:49:37.109]  That's 888-253-3139.

[02:49:45.214 --> 02:49:52.741]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:49:53.021 --> 02:50:03.930]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:50:05.471 --> 02:50:09.594]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:50:09.935 --> 02:50:20.383]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:50:20.683 --> 02:50:21.183]  That's right!
[02:50:21.363 --> 02:50:28.465]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:50:28.765 --> 02:50:32.887]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.

[02:50:47.006 --> 02:50:47.307]  I think so.
[02:51:02.288 --> 02:51:02.889]  I think so.

[02:51:47.896 --> 02:51:49.097]  Alright, final segment.
[02:51:49.777 --> 02:51:52.098]  Indiana executes man in torture killing.
[02:51:52.901 --> 02:52:02.103]  The state of Indiana executed a man convicted of killing a teenage girl by forcing instant glue, or super glue, up her nose and taping her mouth shut for 12 days of rape and torture.
[02:52:03.023 --> 02:52:08.804]  Bill Benfidelity, 48, was pronounced dead yesterday, and I say good riddance.
[02:52:09.624 --> 02:52:12.045]  The problem is they did stuff like this at Camp X-Ray.
[02:52:12.065 --> 02:52:18.566]  They've done stuff like this over at Abu Ghraib, and nothing happens to these people, and they might get six months in jail.
[02:52:19.767 --> 02:52:22.247]  So how is torture bad here, but good when our government does it?
[02:52:22.628 --> 02:52:24.148]  Or good when Alan Dershowitz promotes it?
[02:52:24.488 --> 02:52:25.828]  Torture is torture.
[02:52:26.328 --> 02:52:34.590]  Warning on spread of state surveillance, London Guardian, governments are building a global registration and surveillance infrastructure and the U.S.
[02:52:34.650 --> 02:52:35.610]  led a war on terror.
[02:52:35.630 --> 02:52:37.110]  Civil liberties groups warned yesterday.
[02:52:37.470 --> 02:52:45.371]  The aim is to monitor the movements and activities of entire populations in what campaigners call unprecedented project of social control.
[02:52:45.391 --> 02:52:46.932]  I'm out of time.
[02:52:47.412 --> 02:52:48.332]  Here's Revolution.
[02:52:49.326 --> 02:52:52.667]  I hope to see you tonight at the concert with Jimmy Vaughn and many others.
[02:52:53.328 --> 02:52:57.630]  It's going to be powerful at the Doubletree off of I-35 in North Austin.
[02:52:58.850 --> 02:53:01.291]  And I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central.
[02:53:01.311 --> 02:53:07.174]  And of course, then tomorrow, 11 to 2 Central, we're going to have a big Oklahoma City special.
[02:53:08.454 --> 02:53:09.314]  You do not want to miss it.
[02:53:09.795 --> 02:53:11.015]  Alright, take care my friends.
[02:53:11.055 --> 02:53:11.755]  God bless you all.
[02:53:13.676 --> 02:53:17.458]  Wake up boys, there's a light at the window.
[02:53:19.378 --> 02:53:23.380]  I can hear someone knocking on the door.
[02:53:24.620 --> 02:53:29.302]  There are voices in the street and the sound of running feet.
[02:53:30.023 --> 02:53:32.944]  And they whisper the word, REVOLUTION.
[02:53:35.265 --> 02:53:39.407]  There are men coming down from the valley.
[02:53:41.067 --> 02:53:44.629]  There are tall ships flying off the coast.
[02:53:46.918 --> 02:53:55.625]  And they carry the light In the dark of the night Like a whisper in the wind Revolution!
[02:53:58.367 --> 02:54:07.915]  Bring my gun and a handful of silver By the sea we will gather for the fight
[02:54:10.334 --> 02:54:15.662]  It's been so many years, so many tears.
[02:54:16.102 --> 02:54:21.309]  We have lost once before, now we'll settle the score.
[02:54:46.933 --> 02:54:48.374]  We're good to go.
[02:55:16.116 --> 02:55:37.377]  The last march on the road up the rocky hills tonight Under cover of the darkness we will slip behind the lines And we will take the men who have stolen our land For the years of domination hit them right between the eyes
[02:56:36.310 --> 02:56:36.511]  Power!
