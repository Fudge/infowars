[00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:06.278]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.958 --> 00:00:08.019]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:09.819]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:11.299]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.960]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.241]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:21.942]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.142 --> 00:00:24.043]  Music
[00:00:44.632 --> 00:00:45.953]  Here we are and we're live.
[00:00:46.193 --> 00:00:48.053]  Boy, I jumped in this seat right on time.
[00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:53.714]  We'll be live here for the next three hours and I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:55.254 --> 00:00:56.975]  We've got two great guests coming up today.
[00:00:56.995 --> 00:00:58.955]  Of course, he normally joins us once a week.
[00:00:58.995 --> 00:01:02.195]  Paul Joseph Watson will be on with us.
[00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:10.337]  And we'll talk to a former New York detective who discovered and investigated and was on a state board
[00:01:11.187 --> 00:01:17.472]  The shadowy nightmare underworld of these government controlled white slavery rings.
[00:01:18.433 --> 00:01:22.156]  So you don't want to miss that coming up in the second hour with Jim Rothstein.
[00:01:24.318 --> 00:01:26.400]  I heard him on the Jack Blood Show last week and I've...
[00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:31.112]  Heard that Mr. Rothstein interviewed before, and just powerful information.
[00:01:31.612 --> 00:01:41.919]  Dovetails with what Senator John DeCamp was talking about here on the broadcast just a couple days ago on Monday, along with the other guests that we were talking to.
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:52.607]  But before we get to all of that news, interesting article out of the Associated Press yesterday, White House defends video news releases.
[00:01:54.221 --> 00:02:00.106]  Remember last year it came out when Bush was pushing his Medicare-Medicaid prescription drug plan for seniors?
[00:02:00.746 --> 00:02:06.371]  That they'd spent $76 million?
[00:02:06.391 --> 00:02:12.295]  $76 million just on one fake news release package.
[00:02:13.216 --> 00:02:17.319]  They didn't just send these video news releases out to local networks, local TV stations.
[00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.721]  They paid them to run them.
[00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:30.451]  Well, now it comes out that it's over $240 million that they've spent on other types of these little fake news releases.
[00:02:30.771 --> 00:02:41.694]  And the GAO, the General Accounting Office, which is the investigative arm of Congress, told them that it was illegal and covert propaganda.
[00:02:41.714 --> 00:02:42.394]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:02:43.027 --> 00:02:54.058]  Bush and his new Attorney General, Alberto Gonzalez, say they're above the law, and Gonzalez has released a ruling saying, no, they're allowed to do it and not tell the public that it's fake newscast.
[00:02:54.259 --> 00:03:04.129]  So, this is the level of propaganda and brainwashing that we're dealing with, and I want to talk about it with you, the listeners, today.
[00:03:05.311 --> 00:03:10.212]  Also, I have reports here out of USA Today yesterday.
[00:03:10.612 --> 00:03:14.353]  Fictional 24 brings real issue of torture home.
[00:03:15.093 --> 00:03:21.034]  TV heroes' tactics debated in a world after Abu Ghraib.
[00:03:22.414 --> 00:03:24.335]  And they actually say it's good.
[00:03:24.495 --> 00:03:26.555]  The show is fighting torture.
[00:03:26.755 --> 00:03:29.896]  Of course, that's the complete opposite of what's really going on.
[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.262]  These shows are paid off by the government.
[00:03:32.302 --> 00:03:32.982]  That's admitted.
[00:03:33.423 --> 00:03:35.805]  They're, quote, advised by Homeland Security.
[00:03:35.845 --> 00:03:36.786]  All these different shows.
[00:03:37.106 --> 00:03:41.650]  CSI Miami, Threat Matrix 24, MI6.
[00:03:42.231 --> 00:03:43.532]  All these different programs.
[00:03:43.632 --> 00:03:47.235]  And it's all the same script, just the names of the characters are changed.
[00:03:47.716 --> 00:03:52.220]  On many of the programs, they torture children to make their parents answer questions.
[00:03:52.924 --> 00:03:55.346]  But Amnesty International says it's good.
[00:03:55.767 --> 00:04:00.731]  Now, they've always been a controlled arm, so we will go over this propaganda as well.
[00:04:01.152 --> 00:04:03.074]  And the New York Times is reporting U.S.
[00:04:03.134 --> 00:04:09.179]  report lists possibilities for terrorist attacks and likely death toll, likely targets.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.663]  It's a lengthy article, but I do want to go over that with you.
[00:04:12.703 --> 00:04:17.828]  And the Pentagon is saying the anthrax alert of the last two days proved to be false.
[00:04:18.464 --> 00:04:25.006]  Well, then why did two different military post offices or mail rooms have alerts?
[00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:28.688]  Sounds like a staged event to me.
[00:04:28.708 --> 00:04:33.429]  You've certainly caught them releasing fake terror alerts in the past.
[00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.011]  Also, the government wants your information, and so do the thieves.
[00:04:38.791 --> 00:04:43.173]  An article out of Maine Today, detailing, chronicling,
[00:04:43.872 --> 00:04:53.123]  Now, in this age of Big Brother, it actually makes the identity thieves very happy campers, happy hunters, and the happy hunting ground of the digital age.
[00:04:54.024 --> 00:04:56.767]  PrisonPlanet.tv and Infowars.com are the websites.
[00:04:57.227 --> 00:04:58.028]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:58.048 --> 00:04:58.489]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.272 --> 00:05:05.594]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.794 --> 00:05:10.216]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.356 --> 00:05:14.737]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.777 --> 00:05:16.138]  The New World Order.
[00:05:16.918 --> 00:05:17.858]  Pan Amers.
[00:05:17.918 --> 00:05:22.139]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:22.179 --> 00:05:29.141]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.241 --> 00:05:31.301]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.501 --> 00:05:42.083]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.263 --> 00:05:44.784]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my...
[00:05:44.884 --> 00:05:45.124]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:05:45.144 --> 00:05:46.226]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:06:02.344 --> 00:06:03.405]  The war on terrorism.
[00:06:03.725 --> 00:06:06.508]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:06.768 --> 00:06:10.932]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:11.352 --> 00:06:12.193]  So what do you do?
[00:06:12.494 --> 00:06:17.078]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:17.558 --> 00:06:18.079]  We're good to go.
[00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:18.919]  We're good to go.
[00:06:42.396 --> 00:06:44.299]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:07:00.273 --> 00:07:05.795]  We've all heard about the benefits of infrared light therapy, but never have we heard of anything as amazing as this.
[00:07:05.995 --> 00:07:13.557]  Diametics, the leading authority on polychromatic infrared diode therapy in the U.S., now offers its patented PainX 2000 to the public.
[00:07:13.657 --> 00:07:20.279]  The PainX 2000 uses the same technology NASA uses aboard the space shuttle and the same technology used by the Navy SEALs.
[00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:21.819]  Now it's available to you.
[00:07:21.999 --> 00:07:28.541]  The PainX 2000 is FDA cleared for joint aches and pains, increases circulation, and relaxes those achy muscles.

[00:08:05.638 --> 00:08:06.298]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.959 --> 00:08:08.019]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.719 --> 00:08:09.819]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.300]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.981]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:14.001 --> 00:08:17.322]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.822 --> 00:08:21.863]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:25.347 --> 00:08:28.754]  The Alex Jones Show!
[00:08:39.941 --> 00:08:42.683]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:42.783 --> 00:08:47.226]  It is Wednesday, the 16th day of March, 2005.
[00:08:47.346 --> 00:08:53.310]  We've got 2 hours and 51 minutes, 10 seconds, spanning out the forest.
[00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:55.992]  Paul Watson with his news report.
[00:08:56.698 --> 00:08:59.940]  As he joins us once a week, we'll be with us in about 22 minutes.
[00:09:00.481 --> 00:09:09.987]  And then we have a former New York detective who was also on a governor's state board investigating the government-run white slavery rings.
[00:09:10.047 --> 00:09:12.209]  That's what it led back to.
[00:09:12.909 --> 00:09:20.694]  So coming up later, you will hear, of course, Paul Watson and then the detective Jim Rothstein.
[00:09:21.055 --> 00:09:24.177]  Believe me, you do not want to miss this important information.
[00:09:25.962 --> 00:09:27.923]  But I want to plunge into this first.
[00:09:29.283 --> 00:09:33.584]  And there's so many examples of this, so much background to this.
[00:09:34.464 --> 00:09:36.765]  I talk more and more about this on the broadcast.
[00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:42.347]  I've been discussing it for years and years and years, long before anybody else was talking about it.
[00:09:43.187 --> 00:09:50.329]  I mean, it was very rarely discussed, and I watched it develop with horror during Bill Clinton's tutelage.
[00:09:51.233 --> 00:09:57.195]  When he was the head puppet-in-chief, it got really bad under Clinton.
[00:09:57.295 --> 00:10:14.999]  I knew from hearings back in the 70s that it had been going on back into the 30s with programs like Reefer Madness paid for by the government, paid for by the big cartels that brought in publicly the opium and cocaine programs,
[00:10:15.672 --> 00:10:18.234]  And then manufacture it and turn the opium into heroin.
[00:10:19.074 --> 00:10:38.869]  They didn't like the fact that competition was undercutting them and the price was being driven down, and they just lost a prohibition, which the alcohol producers themselves had actually lobbied for and then already prepositioned themselves in Canada and other areas to then roughly increase the price of alcohol tenfold.
[00:10:39.249 --> 00:10:43.332]  But people had gotten wise to that scam, and so they had...
[00:10:44.312 --> 00:10:48.434]  Struck him down, that particular constitutional amendment.
[00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:52.415]  And so, they needed to make something illegal.
[00:10:52.455 --> 00:10:54.376]  They made narcotics illegal.
[00:10:55.236 --> 00:10:57.798]  Heroin, cocaine, and other things that were sold over the counter.
[00:10:58.358 --> 00:11:08.462]  And then jacked up the prices, massively helped corrupt the police and re-energize their organized crime syndicates with that new black market funding mechanism.
[00:11:09.422 --> 00:11:11.263]  And that's simply what happened.
[00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.582]  You're going, what does this have to do with media controlled by government?
[00:11:14.622 --> 00:11:31.817]  Well, Reefer Madness and a string of other films were produced, westerns, you name it, where it would show the cowboy who was a nice man take one hit off a marijuana cigarette and go, now let's murder people and just start murdering.
[00:11:32.592 --> 00:11:33.633]  Or reefer madness.
[00:11:33.673 --> 00:11:50.008]  You take one hit off of it, you're suddenly having sex orgies and murdering people and slaughtering and going to prison and just doing heart-running people down in the road, becoming a crazed psychopathic demon like you were on PCP or something.
[00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:52.010]  And it was paid for by the government.
[00:11:52.944 --> 00:12:00.328]  And the films mirrored the several string of films that were made, you know, based in the time, based in the mid-30s.
[00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:21.981]  Like Reefer Madness, they even, you know, the film starts with the crusader from the federal government who's a professor, and he travels around to all the PTAs in the country, and there's a menace of drugs, ladies and gentlemen, and only you, the local groups, can get involved to stop it, make it illegal in your state, help the federal government, you know,
[00:12:22.401 --> 00:12:23.741]  Cattle on everyone!
[00:12:24.582 --> 00:12:31.184]  Well, in the film, they have this character, who then, after the film came out, was a real character they gave the public.
[00:12:32.444 --> 00:12:36.866]  So, what we see is, after 9-11, they come out and say, Torture is good!
[00:12:36.906 --> 00:12:41.207]  And the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Washington Times, Torture!
[00:12:41.247 --> 00:12:41.647]  Torture!
[00:12:41.927 --> 00:12:43.328]  Let's get cattle prods out!
[00:12:43.368 --> 00:12:44.368]  Let's torture people!
[00:12:44.388 --> 00:12:45.168]  Let's kill them!
[00:12:45.409 --> 00:12:46.589]  Let's put them in camps!
[00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:48.091]  And I go, wait a minute.
[00:12:48.131 --> 00:12:59.304]  Law enforcement magazines, years before 9-11, had these exact type of basic moral games they were playing where, well, one of the terrorists has got a bomb.
[00:12:59.907 --> 00:13:03.068]  And he's going to blow people up, and you've tortured him, and he won't answer.
[00:13:03.348 --> 00:13:05.308]  What about torturing his child?
[00:13:05.809 --> 00:13:07.649]  Well, our expert thinks it's good.
[00:13:08.149 --> 00:13:11.310]  Or what if they're about to release anthrax, and they won't tell you where it's at?
[00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:12.330]  We've got to torture them.
[00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:22.833]  You know, all these examples where they get you to play these little mental mind games with yourself and go, well, I guess I would torture them, as if you're ever going to need to torture somebody in that type of...
[00:13:24.409 --> 00:13:25.510]  That type of situation.
[00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:38.718]  No, it just legitimizes torture across the board to where now, every day or two, they've got somebody chained down on a hospital bed, totally restrained, who refuses to give them a urine sample, so they taser them.
[00:13:38.898 --> 00:13:41.460]  Or a young man is choking on a hamburger.
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.382]  The police taser him 16 times just for fun.
[00:13:45.162 --> 00:13:48.224]  Or police break people's arms in the real world.
[00:13:48.624 --> 00:13:49.285]  It doesn't matter.
[00:13:49.325 --> 00:13:52.627]  They have shows, you've heard clips of it, like Boston Legal.
[00:13:53.644 --> 00:13:53.964]  Where?
[00:13:54.024 --> 00:13:57.767]  They break the innocent man's arm, and it turns out he was innocent, but they meant well.
[00:13:57.807 --> 00:13:59.569]  They went ahead and broke it for a good cause.
[00:13:59.969 --> 00:14:08.416]  So the jury goes, well, Alberto Gonzalez says it's okay, and Alan Dershowitz says it's okay.
[00:14:08.576 --> 00:14:10.818]  On TV, they're actually talking about real characters.
[00:14:11.198 --> 00:14:12.079]  In the real world.
[00:14:12.399 --> 00:14:13.779]  And so, this is good.
[00:14:13.979 --> 00:14:18.301]  They actually said on the program, torture is as American as apple pie.
[00:14:18.462 --> 00:14:19.542]  We love torture.
[00:14:19.802 --> 00:14:20.903]  Torture is good.
[00:14:20.923 --> 00:14:23.444]  Remember that clip we played several times about a month ago?
[00:14:23.744 --> 00:14:24.985]  Torture is good.
[00:14:25.025 --> 00:14:26.005]  It's good.
[00:14:26.585 --> 00:14:27.706]  It's good.
[00:14:29.267 --> 00:14:29.647]  Alright?
[00:14:30.971 --> 00:14:32.311]  So this is going on.
[00:14:32.411 --> 00:14:35.672]  So first they come out in mainstream media and say torture's good.
[00:14:35.752 --> 00:14:51.116]  Then suddenly every cop show, every drama, from The Shield to Boston Legal to the final episodes of NYPD Blue, The Threat Matrix to 24 to CSI and CSI Miami and to the show Spooks and MI6 and...
[00:14:53.385 --> 00:14:54.805]  I mean, I hardly ever watch television.
[00:14:54.905 --> 00:14:57.326]  Every time I turn it on in Channel Surf, they're torturing somebody.
[00:14:57.506 --> 00:14:58.346]  I mean, I'm not kidding.
[00:14:58.766 --> 00:15:00.727]  Every time I'm in a restaurant, they've got a TV on.
[00:15:01.407 --> 00:15:03.327]  I must have bad luck.
[00:15:03.588 --> 00:15:04.608]  Are you seeing this, too?
[00:15:04.908 --> 00:15:06.288]  I see torture on the screen.
[00:15:06.608 --> 00:15:09.009]  I walk into the TV station, they've got TVs on.
[00:15:09.489 --> 00:15:11.710]  And they're torturing somebody in a torture chair.
[00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:12.730]  And it's good.
[00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:13.830]  It's just everywhere.
[00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:17.351]  Torture, torture, torture, torture, torture, torture, torture, torture.
[00:15:18.453 --> 00:15:19.373]  And it's always the same.
[00:15:19.653 --> 00:15:20.394]  I don't want to do this.
[00:15:20.414 --> 00:15:21.394]  You're making me do this.
[00:15:21.454 --> 00:15:22.074]  I'm sorry.
[00:15:22.094 --> 00:15:25.715]  You know, it's always the good-looking CIA officer, the good-looking young lady.
[00:15:26.055 --> 00:15:27.956]  And she kind of gets sad as she has to kill him.
[00:15:28.316 --> 00:15:29.676]  All right, I'm going to full power.
[00:15:29.917 --> 00:15:32.397]  And the person's always, ah, go ahead and try it.
[00:15:32.577 --> 00:15:33.378]  You know, they deserve it.
[00:15:33.398 --> 00:15:34.898]  They're like these inhuman creatures.
[00:15:35.358 --> 00:15:37.459]  And they're in a torture chair with lesions all over their body.
[00:15:37.499 --> 00:15:38.499]  And she goes, okay.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:40.800]  Oh, he died.
[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:42.100]  Doesn't matter.
[00:15:42.941 --> 00:15:47.542]  He gave us little clues under torture, and we stopped the nuclear bomb from going off.
[00:15:49.309 --> 00:15:50.931]  And then, you know, 24.
[00:15:51.411 --> 00:15:56.075]  Oh, we've got to torture the Secretary of State or the Attorney General's son.
[00:15:56.556 --> 00:15:59.939]  And the Attorney General gives the order to torture his son.
[00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:03.082]  And his son was innocent, but still, they needed to do it.
[00:16:03.182 --> 00:16:06.385]  And he says, well, I love my son, but I love my country more.
[00:16:06.985 --> 00:16:08.927]  Oh, you torture your own child.
[00:16:10.228 --> 00:16:11.850]  And then, in the real world...
[00:16:12.907 --> 00:16:16.611]  Cops are tasering innocent people to get answers out of them while they're chained down in jails.
[00:16:16.831 --> 00:16:18.072]  Another case of it yesterday.
[00:16:18.913 --> 00:16:19.593]  To get answers.
[00:16:19.613 --> 00:16:21.775]  Oh, I'm going to torture you all with the cops on camera.
[00:16:21.976 --> 00:16:23.417]  They just think it's normal.
[00:16:23.737 --> 00:16:25.519]  It's almost normalized now.
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.784]  And then we see the case a couple weeks ago.
[00:16:32.063 --> 00:16:34.565]  Student, high school, no criminal record, never been in trouble.
[00:16:34.805 --> 00:16:37.927]  He's in an English class, they say write a fiction article.
[00:16:38.348 --> 00:16:41.970]  He writes about a fictitious high school, not his, no names of anybody real.
[00:16:42.391 --> 00:16:45.453]  Zombies bust out of graves, attack the school.
[00:16:46.313 --> 00:16:51.337]  And he shows his grandparents and they, oh, I think this is a good paper for school.
[00:16:52.258 --> 00:16:57.001]  And they go in and call the police and they show up and go, good job to the grandparents.
[00:16:57.021 --> 00:16:58.282]  And they go, we're sorry, Billy.
[00:16:59.102 --> 00:17:01.263]  And Billy gets taken away going, it's an article.
[00:17:02.323 --> 00:17:02.543]  What?
[00:17:02.724 --> 00:17:04.084]  And they just go, uh-huh.
[00:17:04.704 --> 00:17:05.705]  We had to do this.
[00:17:05.745 --> 00:17:07.666]  And they charge him with terrorism.
[00:17:08.006 --> 00:17:17.050]  And the cops are in the newspaper going, well, it is a school with zombies, but threatening a school with zombies they actually said is a terroristic threat.
[00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:19.391]  And it doesn't matter if it's fiction.
[00:17:19.551 --> 00:17:20.711]  Look out Stephen King.
[00:17:21.712 --> 00:17:22.752]  Look out Clive Barker.
[00:17:24.462 --> 00:17:29.644]  And folks, since I talked about this, so many people have emailed us and written us, Oh, I wrote stories in school about zombies.
[00:17:29.664 --> 00:17:31.365]  It seems to be a popular genre.
[00:17:31.405 --> 00:17:34.347]  There's been 20 films made of zombies attacking.
[00:17:34.947 --> 00:17:37.689]  I mean, I wrote an article in 7th grade about zombies.
[00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:41.651]  And I got an A+.
[00:17:41.991 --> 00:17:45.333]  Maybe I'll be arrested retroactively decades and decades later.
[00:17:45.413 --> 00:17:48.855]  But this is what's going on, folks.
[00:17:50.021 --> 00:17:51.903]  And the government is paying for it.
[00:17:51.963 --> 00:18:05.975]  So when we get back, White House defends video news releases and they say, we don't care if the experts in the Congress and the law experts at the universities say that these are felonies because we're above the law.
[00:18:06.055 --> 00:18:07.176]  We are the executive.
[00:18:07.336 --> 00:18:08.758]  No, you execute the law.
[00:18:09.118 --> 00:18:10.499]  You do not make the law.
[00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:15.864]  And then I've got this huge article out of
[00:18:16.858 --> 00:18:19.099]  USA Today, where they laud.
[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.261]  They go, it's wonderful.
[00:18:21.921 --> 00:18:23.782]  Every episode is torture.
[00:18:23.802 --> 00:18:26.204]  And it's so good.
[00:18:26.264 --> 00:18:28.085]  And see, now there's a culture war over this.
[00:18:28.945 --> 00:18:31.287]  All these neocons are writing about how good it is.
[00:18:32.167 --> 00:18:36.290]  And Embassy International, that always whitewashes the real level of torture and evil.
[00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:37.951]  Oh, we think it's good.
[00:18:39.352 --> 00:18:40.512]  Oh, it's really good.
[00:18:41.973 --> 00:18:42.934]  It's not bad.
[00:18:44.784 --> 00:18:47.525]  Fictional 24 brings real issues of torture home.
[00:18:48.746 --> 00:18:51.767]  TV heroes' tactics debated in the world after Abu Ghraib.
[00:18:52.927 --> 00:18:55.648]  In the post-9-11 world, torture has hit the public radar.
[00:18:55.688 --> 00:19:05.372]  News reports about Abu Ghraib, congressional questioning of cabinet nominees, and increasingly as a featured interrogation tactic on Fox's surreal thriller 24.
[00:19:06.869 --> 00:19:10.271]  As politicians pundits in the public debate, extreme interrogation.
[00:19:10.572 --> 00:19:11.832]  See, now they just changed the term.
[00:19:11.853 --> 00:19:12.573]  It's not torture.
[00:19:12.593 --> 00:19:13.754]  It's not even abuse now.
[00:19:13.874 --> 00:19:15.375]  It's extreme interrogation.
[00:19:16.396 --> 00:19:23.120]  24, which is enjoying a surge in critical praise and a 32% jump in viewers this season, has jumped to action.
[00:19:24.421 --> 00:19:30.125]  The Florida terrorist plot hero, Jack Bauer, Kiefer Sutherland, they've been torturing for four seasons on there.
[00:19:30.145 --> 00:19:30.886]  This isn't new.
[00:19:31.346 --> 00:19:34.308]  The Florida terrorist plot hero, Jack Bauer, Kiefer Sutherland,
[00:19:35.353 --> 00:19:50.246]  And his counter-terrorist unit have shot a suspect in the leg while interrogating him, subjected the son of the defense secretary to high-tech sensory deprivation, stun-gunned a suspect but innocent colleague, and used a lamp cord to shock information from a businessman.
[00:19:51.247 --> 00:19:53.949]  And then they go on to say, this is good.
[00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:57.212]  This is America.
[00:19:57.672 --> 00:19:58.333]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:01.411 --> 00:20:02.452]  Are you losing your hair?
[00:20:02.792 --> 00:20:04.233]  Is that bald spot getting bigger?
[00:20:04.573 --> 00:20:05.714]  Is your hair looking thinner?
[00:20:06.235 --> 00:20:07.896]  Why aren't you using Avacor?
[00:20:08.116 --> 00:20:12.679]  The hair growth treatment that has helped thousands of people just like you regrow their hair.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:16.082]  I've been using Avacor now for four months and it's a great product.
[00:20:16.222 --> 00:20:18.303]  They back everything with a money back guarantee.
[00:20:18.624 --> 00:20:19.344]  It works.
[00:20:19.724 --> 00:20:23.047]  My hair hasn't looked this good in over 15 years.
[00:20:23.761 --> 00:20:28.565]  If you're losing your hair and haven't tried Avacor yet, how about a free month's supply?
[00:20:28.785 --> 00:20:32.488]  We're giving away a free month of Avacor with all of today's orders.

[00:21:01.417 --> 00:21:02.897]  To the farthest corners of the earth.
[00:21:03.197 --> 00:21:07.779]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[00:21:08.119 --> 00:21:10.459]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[00:21:10.679 --> 00:21:12.220]  Achieve financial independence.

[00:22:00.788 --> 00:22:02.389]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:22:02.749 --> 00:22:08.492]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:22:08.752 --> 00:22:13.895]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:22:14.235 --> 00:22:23.500]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:28.803]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:22:29.143 --> 00:22:33.165]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:22:33.345 --> 00:22:38.128]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:22:38.488 --> 00:22:44.391]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[00:22:55.006 --> 00:22:56.047]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:23:01.398 --> 00:23:03.819]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:04.559 --> 00:23:08.200]  Have you ever heard of the Genocide Convention Treaty to the United Nations?
[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:12.701]  Did you know that it's a direct assault upon your freedom of religion?
[00:23:13.401 --> 00:23:22.004]  Did you know that if you mention perverted sex acts as being wrong according to the Bible, you could be arrested and tried for causing mental harm to others?
[00:23:22.964 --> 00:23:30.126]  It's already law in Canada, Australia, Britain and Sweden where Christians are being tried and deprived of freedom of speech.
[00:23:31.053 --> 00:23:31.393]  Call now.
[00:23:31.473 --> 00:23:34.034]  Our operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:24:05.968 --> 00:24:07.870]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:08.351 --> 00:24:11.194]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:13.356 --> 00:24:25.110]  The globalists, brain scientists, that's what the Nazis called it, brain war, mind war, know the power of archetypal images and heroes, idols.
[00:24:26.084 --> 00:24:49.766]  And so if you thought it was bad enough to have, you know, just 60, 70 years ago, the heroes were scientists and explorers and people that, you know, climbed to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro or folks who invented scuba gear, people that expanded our frontiers, academics, mathematicians.
[00:24:50.764 --> 00:25:02.448]  If you thought it was bad to have the heroes turned into basketball and baseball players, and if you thought it was bad to have the heroes turned into Hollywood stars, oh no!
[00:25:03.148 --> 00:25:09.291]  Now the new heroes, and they admit that in these New York Times and USA Today articles, the new heroes are torture men.
[00:25:09.731 --> 00:25:13.092]  Torture technique experts in the torture chambers.
[00:25:13.232 --> 00:25:15.653]  Every night, every episode, they torture.
[00:25:16.053 --> 00:25:16.713]  They kill.
[00:25:17.113 --> 00:25:17.833]  They murder.
[00:25:18.274 --> 00:25:19.134]  And it's good.
[00:25:20.282 --> 00:25:22.823]  The heroes are the torture experts.
[00:25:23.363 --> 00:25:34.426]  Why, O'Brien from 1984 and 2005, who tortured people brutally unto the edge of death, who broke their minds, he'd be a hero.
[00:25:34.826 --> 00:25:39.307]  He'd walk into 2005 into the real world and he'd be on national TV.
[00:25:41.028 --> 00:25:43.189]  He'd be made Attorney General.
[00:25:43.709 --> 00:25:46.810]  He'd say the President, Big Brother, was above the law.
[00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:48.230]  Think about that.
[00:25:49.625 --> 00:25:54.189]  And this article in USA Today continues, talking about how they torture people.
[00:25:54.950 --> 00:26:10.324]  For 24's producers, in their fourth season of constructing a save-the-world scenario that must be completed in one day, selling you the government saving you every day, of course, the use of torture is about real-time drama, not politics.
[00:26:10.344 --> 00:26:12.666]  Sure, just admitted that you're advised by Homeland Security.
[00:26:13.187 --> 00:26:13.767]  It goes with the 24...
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.702]  Concept that we need information and don't have days to break this person.
[00:26:20.022 --> 00:26:21.383]  Sometimes we don't even have hours.
[00:26:21.783 --> 00:26:27.546]  Executive producer Howard Gordon says, 24's writers aren't taking a political stand.
[00:26:27.706 --> 00:26:28.447]  Oh, sure they're not.
[00:26:28.727 --> 00:26:34.470]  But they know that the real world debate with its pros and cons is the public consciousness, Gordon says.
[00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:41.113]  The substance of an upcoming episode will hinge on whether the president allows a suspect's torture, he says.
[00:26:41.773 --> 00:26:43.074]  You know how that's going to end.
[00:26:45.026 --> 00:26:45.886]  Every episode.
[00:26:47.227 --> 00:26:50.648]  Outsiders have drawn connections between the real world and the fictional 24.
[00:26:51.448 --> 00:26:55.710]  The Council on American-Islamic Relations criticized the depiction of Muslim terrorists.
[00:26:55.730 --> 00:27:01.612]  The New York Times column compared 24's focus on domestic terror threats to the Bush administration's focus on Iraq.
[00:27:01.972 --> 00:27:09.375]  And Karen Greenberg, co-editor of the torture papers The Road to Abu Ghraib, mentioned the series in a Baltimore Sun column about U.S.
[00:27:09.415 --> 00:27:10.195]  torture policy.
[00:27:10.595 --> 00:27:11.856]  We've been talking about it for three years.
[00:27:12.817 --> 00:27:24.845]  Alistair Hoggett of Amnesty International credits 24 in A&E's MI5, which allows the British Secret Service with realistic depictions that provide a clear idea of what torture involves.
[00:27:24.885 --> 00:27:27.006]  They do more than educate.
[00:27:27.987 --> 00:27:29.168]  They desensitize.
[00:27:30.194 --> 00:27:41.044]  And Gordon says, 24 taps in the public's fear-based wish fulfillment of having protectors such as Bauer, who will do whatever is necessary to save society from harm.
[00:27:41.084 --> 00:27:42.725]  But it shows a dark side, too.
[00:27:43.146 --> 00:27:45.067]  Jack Bauer is a tragic character.
[00:27:45.408 --> 00:27:46.829]  He doesn't get away with it clean.
[00:27:46.849 --> 00:27:48.891]  He's got blood on his hands, Gordon says.
[00:27:49.231 --> 00:27:51.533]  In some ways, he's a necessary evil.
[00:27:54.668 --> 00:27:55.109]  Oh, boy.
[00:27:55.669 --> 00:28:03.696]  And for years we've caught them funding these different shows, both the real-life cop shows and the dramas and the sitcoms.
[00:28:04.157 --> 00:28:08.221]  I mean, I've been sent tapes where you're watching Friends, and they go, it's the New World Order.
[00:28:08.601 --> 00:28:09.362]  Get used to it.
[00:28:09.382 --> 00:28:10.262]  Just out of the blue.
[00:28:11.544 --> 00:28:12.184]  You've all seen it.
[00:28:12.204 --> 00:28:15.127]  You call in almost daily talking about what you've watched on television.
[00:28:15.706 --> 00:28:17.487]  New World Order this, world government that.
[00:28:17.847 --> 00:28:19.728]  Judging Amy almost every episode.
[00:28:19.768 --> 00:28:22.590]  It's some crazy mother who thinks there's a world government.
[00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:28.574]  So CPS takes her child because she's some type of psychopath because you believe in a world government.
[00:28:29.594 --> 00:28:31.595]  It's just over and over and over.
[00:28:31.695 --> 00:28:32.596]  It's everywhere!
[00:28:33.288 --> 00:28:48.502]  And then in the real world, FEMA is having drills, if counties want money, where the school districts do a drill where the homeschoolers attack and murder everyone in the school bus and they get 200 of the elementary students out and put fake blood on them and fake intestines hanging out.
[00:28:48.522 --> 00:28:49.563]  By the way, I've been to these drills.
[00:28:49.643 --> 00:28:50.924]  It's in Road to Tyranny.
[00:28:51.781 --> 00:28:52.822]  Right here in Central Texas.
[00:28:53.342 --> 00:28:56.024]  And they tell them the evil right-wingers have attacked you.
[00:28:56.124 --> 00:29:07.893]  And they brainwash hundreds of kids per episode in real life with cops running around in masks playing the part of the, quote, citizens against public school.
[00:29:08.353 --> 00:29:09.734]  And they murder you.
[00:29:10.405 --> 00:29:13.707]  Of course, it isn't real, but they're simulating it everywhere.
[00:29:14.148 --> 00:29:16.629]  And then they simulate it on TV.
[00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:26.096]  And imagine being an eight-year-old child, and this is the field trip as they get you out in the parking lot of the school and splatter fake blood on you.
[00:29:26.156 --> 00:29:31.019]  And they have fake arms blown off and fake intestines hanging out.
[00:29:31.299 --> 00:29:33.521]  And the homeschoolers, they're going to get you.
[00:29:33.741 --> 00:29:34.801]  They're going to get you.
[00:29:35.382 --> 00:29:38.004]  That is trauma-based mind control.
[00:29:38.044 --> 00:29:39.965]  That is incredible abuse.
[00:29:41.013 --> 00:29:43.994]  Did you just send your children to school to have it done to them?
[00:29:44.735 --> 00:29:50.237]  After all, it's the government, and now they're going to have their forced psychological testing and drugging with new freedom!
[00:29:51.717 --> 00:29:52.658]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.118 --> 00:29:54.738]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.639 --> 00:29:58.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.797 --> 00:30:09.302]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:30:09.723 --> 00:30:14.267]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:30:14.387 --> 00:30:21.214]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:30:21.594 --> 00:30:27.720]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:29.061]  There are no side effects.
[00:30:29.241 --> 00:30:29.782]  We're good to go.
[00:30:46.181 --> 00:30:49.325]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.

[00:31:01.525 --> 00:31:05.408]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:31:05.648 --> 00:31:11.073]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:31:11.353 --> 00:31:21.721]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:31:21.901 --> 00:31:26.225]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:31:26.425 --> 00:31:34.770]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:41.334]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odor.
[00:31:41.554 --> 00:31:41.774]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:32:02.188 --> 00:32:07.709]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[00:32:07.849 --> 00:32:08.929]  You wear deodorant, right?
[00:32:09.049 --> 00:32:09.909]  Well, let's hope you do.
[00:32:10.029 --> 00:32:12.870]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:17.931]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[00:32:18.171 --> 00:32:19.271]  Check out this new product.
[00:32:19.411 --> 00:32:22.292]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[00:32:22.692 --> 00:32:26.393]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[00:32:26.573 --> 00:32:29.053]  Look, the creator of No-B-O understands what you're going through.
[00:32:29.293 --> 00:32:29.794]  We're good to go.
[00:32:46.192 --> 00:32:49.053]  NoBO is so highly concentrated, a little goes a long way.

[00:32:52.335 --> 00:32:54.776]  Check out their website at no-bo.com.
[00:32:54.936 --> 00:32:58.238]  Come on, it's time for you to enjoy the sweet smell of success with NoBO.
[00:32:58.418 --> 00:33:00.019]  That's no-bo.com.
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:09.983]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:33:10.403 --> 00:33:13.485]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:21.889 --> 00:33:24.730]  All right, I know we already have a lot of phone calls on the line.
[00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:28.852]  I haven't given the number out yet, but we will go to your calls before this hour ends.
[00:33:28.872 --> 00:33:31.773]  Then we'll have open phones 30 minutes into the next hour.
[00:33:31.793 --> 00:33:34.394]  Then we have a guest joining us.
[00:33:34.834 --> 00:33:39.155]  Paul Watson will be riding shotgun with us with our guest that is coming up.
[00:33:39.916 --> 00:33:46.858]  He was a New York detective and even was on the governor's board investigating the government-run white slavery rings.
[00:33:47.779 --> 00:33:51.000]  And we had Senator DeCamp on along with Tom Flacco on Monday.
[00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:54.872]  Exposing this nightmare, and that's coming up in the next hour.
[00:33:55.773 --> 00:34:03.958]  So with myself and Paul Watson and Jim Rothstein, this should be very, very illuminating, very revealing.
[00:34:04.699 --> 00:34:09.002]  We'll go to John and Robert and Ed and others that are holding as well again before this hour ends.
[00:34:09.382 --> 00:34:12.824]  I've got a bunch of news I want to cover with Paul, and I know he's got a lot of news he wants to cover.
[00:34:13.105 --> 00:34:16.227]  Before we go to Paul Watson, who's waiting in the wings right now...
[00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:27.838]  I just want to tell you listeners that my new film, Martial Law 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State, by Preeminent Work, is out.
[00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:32.301]  And it's two hours, 35 minutes long, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:32.341 --> 00:34:33.562]  Two hours, 35 minutes.
[00:34:34.043 --> 00:34:37.605]  It's really three films in one with another mini-documentary at the end.
[00:34:37.625 --> 00:34:44.891]  So really, four films, 35 minutes on the latest police state developments where we're threatened to be arrested, hover blimps, sound cannons,
[00:34:45.771 --> 00:34:52.535]  Just total martial law, the police being savage towards the peaceful demonstrators, being very mean to us for no reason.
[00:34:53.276 --> 00:34:54.677]  Just total martial law.
[00:34:55.637 --> 00:34:58.679]  So we show you the atmosphere that America's been turned into.
[00:34:58.699 --> 00:35:02.281]  Then we spend an hour on 9-11, the latest developments.
[00:35:02.321 --> 00:35:04.143]  I mean, it's a powerful film in and of itself.
[00:35:04.523 --> 00:35:08.225]  Then we look at the ideology, the philosophy of the elite.
[00:35:08.585 --> 00:35:10.887]  We start out by confronting David Bergen on the street of New York.
[00:35:11.545 --> 00:35:16.987]  It's the equivalent of Karl Rove of four administrations and asking about the rituals at Bohemian Grove.
[00:35:17.007 --> 00:35:17.887]  He doesn't deny them.
[00:35:17.927 --> 00:35:19.468]  He blows up and gets in my face.
[00:35:20.368 --> 00:35:29.971]  We then get into how Bohemian Grove and Skull and Bones is part of a Germanic death cult known as the Order of Death that the Nazis were also members of.
[00:35:30.031 --> 00:35:31.712]  It all comes from the same root.
[00:35:32.768 --> 00:35:50.235]  And then we get into the Bushes and the Nazis, and the Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove connection, Arnold and the Nazis, right up to Bush's inauguration where he swears to uphold the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and we show for ten minutes at the end how they've totally dismantled the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:35:50.575 --> 00:35:50.675]  It's 2595.
[00:35:53.894 --> 00:35:57.240]  But if you order three or more of any of the 12 films I've made, they all drop down to $19.95.
[00:35:57.521 --> 00:36:07.138]  That's an $18 discount on a three-tape special, $24 discount on a four-tape special, $30 discount on a five-tape special, and so on and so forth.
[00:36:07.842 --> 00:36:08.343]  We're good to go.
[00:36:26.778 --> 00:36:28.219]  Or call toll-free to get the videos.
[00:36:28.239 --> 00:36:28.339]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:36:28.379 --> 00:36:29.199]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:36:29.219 --> 00:36:32.660]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:34.341]  And send in your mail order.
[00:36:34.401 --> 00:36:36.462]  And by the way, we ship it out UPS-
[00:36:56.013 --> 00:37:04.397]  I'm sick and tired of the Postal Service taking weeks and weeks, even when you pay for priority mail, which they do not ship when they say they will.
[00:37:04.757 --> 00:37:06.678]  UPS does, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:07.119 --> 00:37:09.820]  Unless so specified, that's how you get it shipped to you.
[00:37:11.623 --> 00:37:18.389]  Now, again, you can also go to prisonplanet.tv and just briefly to tell us how folks can go to prisonplanet.tv and sign up to watch the film.
[00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:29.739]  Paul Watson, your take on martial law and just a few of the over 100 reviews we've now gotten and how people can watch it at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:35.363]  Well, as many people have said in those reviews which are at prisonplanet.tv,
[00:37:37.096 --> 00:37:39.176]  Most probably your best work to date.
[00:37:39.977 --> 00:37:42.117]  And people can go to prisonplanet.tv.
[00:37:42.137 --> 00:37:44.617]  There's a big banner at the top.

[00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:02.301]  As well as martial law, obviously.
[00:38:02.321 --> 00:38:04.741]  It's got all your other documentary films on it.
[00:38:05.919 --> 00:38:15.306]  My book, your book, the major audio interviews from the Alex Jones Show, other e-books, other documentary films by other authors.
[00:38:16.126 --> 00:38:22.371]  So for what amounts to 15 cents a day if you subscribe for a year, it's the best deal out there.

[00:38:27.134 --> 00:38:31.757]  And Paul, again, we have asked people for bad reviews.
[00:38:32.017 --> 00:38:34.119]  I mean, we are posting all the reviews...
[00:38:34.973 --> 00:38:38.435]  Over a hundred of them now on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:38:39.016 --> 00:38:42.258]  And you can go to the martial law page on Prison Planet and it says read reviews.
[00:38:42.798 --> 00:38:48.862]  And we haven't gotten, I haven't looked at it in the last few days, but as of a few days ago, no negative reviews.
[00:38:48.902 --> 00:38:53.005]  I mean, if you want to watch it on PrisonPlanet.tv and don't like it, tell us.
[00:38:53.385 --> 00:38:57.087]  I mean, have we gotten any negative reviews, Paul?
[00:38:57.948 --> 00:38:58.828]  None whatsoever.
[00:39:00.129 --> 00:39:04.072]  The only comments are, you know, to do with, well, he could have put this in and this.
[00:39:04.702 --> 00:39:14.531]  The fact is that the films already were approaching two and a quarter, two hours, 20 minutes long anyway, so it's just amazing how much you actually got in there in that time.
[00:39:14.831 --> 00:39:15.692]  Two hours, 35 minutes.
[00:39:16.952 --> 00:39:34.786]  Yeah, so, I mean, there's a lot you could have put in there, but a lot of that is in the previous films, and it's the latest up-to-date information on the vital issues, which are 9-11 and the police state, as was very graphically seen in New York City during the convention.
[00:39:34.886 --> 00:39:37.328]  So, basically, no bad reviews.
[00:39:37.368 --> 00:39:44.013]  We've got something approaching 100 on the martial law page, so, you know, you don't have to believe us.
[00:39:44.073 --> 00:39:45.895]  Go and see what other people have said about the film.
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:53.583]  You can also, we've not just posted the trailer and some other select clips, we're putting other longer clips of the film up for free.
[00:39:54.463 --> 00:40:06.268]  Yeah, yesterday we put up the Nazi Ties to the Bush Family, which included an interview with John Buchanan, who was instrumental in getting mainstream newspapers
[00:40:07.205 --> 00:40:25.911]  Like the London Guardian in September of last year to cover the facts which are now being released, and he directed them to the actual documents out of the official government archives to prove those links, and we've put up a ten-minute segment on that, and more of those will follow in the coming days and weeks.
[00:40:25.971 --> 00:40:30.813]  Because our goal is to get the word out and warn people, so prisonplanet.tv.
[00:40:30.913 --> 00:40:33.654]  All right, I want to go to some calls, but Paul, you've...
[00:40:34.674 --> 00:40:36.115]  We probably heard him before he came on.
[00:40:36.635 --> 00:40:49.883]  I'm ranting and raving about USA Today and New York Times and all these big publications lauding these torture shows where every episode they torture children, they torture women, they torture people to death.
[00:40:50.203 --> 00:40:59.068]  I mean, they're really trying to warp our minds, and on the heels of that, White House defense video news releases now over $200 million worth of fake newscasts.
[00:40:59.668 --> 00:41:01.990]  I don't think folks realize just how serious this has gotten.
[00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:02.630]  Your take on that?
[00:41:03.513 --> 00:41:07.935]  Well, no, people don't realise how closely intertwined Hollywood and the government are.
[00:41:08.416 --> 00:41:21.763]  I mean, we had that article just a week ago about how Homeland Security basically intimately tied with Hollywood on agreeing to certain plots, suggesting certain plots in new movies and series.
[00:41:22.503 --> 00:41:24.283]  And it does cross over into real life.
[00:41:24.343 --> 00:41:35.066]  I mean, the British Foreign Ambassador Jack Straw recently came out and said that MI5 and MI6 would continue to take testimony gained under torture.
[00:41:35.606 --> 00:41:49.669]  And Jack Straw is the same guy that assured the people in Uzbekistan, whose president likes to boil people alive, that he lost sleep over the fact that MI6 used evidence obtained from their torture
[00:41:50.947 --> 00:41:56.529]  Well, it's like, Paul, they send people to prison who follow their orders to torture, and of course enjoyed it, too.
[00:41:57.089 --> 00:41:59.350]  But we have the Pentagon's own documents.
[00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:00.250]  It was all ordered.
[00:42:00.751 --> 00:42:07.433]  And then the memos come out, and they get Alberto Gonzalez up in front of the Senate, and he goes, yeah, we ordered it.
[00:42:08.133 --> 00:42:10.374]  We can torture people up until the point they die.
[00:42:10.694 --> 00:42:11.674]  And we didn't mean to kill them.
[00:42:11.714 --> 00:42:12.275]  It's okay.
[00:42:12.295 --> 00:42:13.595]  The president's above the law.
[00:42:14.135 --> 00:42:16.336]  So, I mean, it's all certified in plain view.
[00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:40.638]  Yeah, and the guy who blew the whistle on it in Britain with the torture jets flying out to Uzbekistan, which has a 100% conviction rate from people they arrest because it's the total police state, he pointed out the torture and the resolution, the solution to that torture from the British government was to sack the ambassador who blew the whistle on it.
[00:42:40.998 --> 00:42:43.119]  So that's the kind of attitude they've got towards it.
[00:42:43.931 --> 00:42:53.579]  Because the Uzbekis want to promote the idea that Al-Qaeda has cells in Uzbekistan so they can then support the war on terror in the West and getting rid of them.
[00:42:53.639 --> 00:42:55.040]  So they've got their own agenda.
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:43:02.005]  Meanwhile, MI6 CIA continues to use the testimony from these tortured people to prop up that very illusion.
[00:43:02.025 --> 00:43:08.490]  They're also flying American citizens to a bunch of different countries.
[00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:10.772]  Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt.
[00:43:11.272 --> 00:43:14.274]  And I mean, that came out in the Washington Post in 2001.
[00:43:14.575 --> 00:43:20.579]  After 9-11 they bragged, oh yeah, we're taking in the third party countries and we're torturing their children in front of them.
[00:43:20.859 --> 00:43:22.641]  So they've been bragging about this for a while.
[00:43:23.461 --> 00:43:24.602]  Well, I mean, it's public.
[00:43:24.862 --> 00:43:36.471]  I mean, I know people down in London who see almost on a daily basis the white Gulfstream jet taking off to take prisoners to places like Uzbekistan and Egypt to be tortured.
[00:43:36.631 --> 00:43:38.512]  And it's been labeled the torture jet.
[00:43:38.612 --> 00:43:40.554]  So they don't even try and hide this kind of stuff.
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:49.022]  And then it goes back into the drama series like 24, as the article in USA Today pointed out, where the heroes now torture.
[00:43:49.382 --> 00:43:57.824]  We've got the exact same show in Britain, which revolves around MI5, MI6, where they torture people's children to gain information.
[00:43:57.884 --> 00:44:01.806]  Now, I wonder what happens next time they catch a serial killer who's torturing children.
[00:44:02.086 --> 00:44:05.407]  Will the serial killer come into court and go, what I'm doing is moral and good?
[00:44:05.427 --> 00:44:07.087]  I mean, your government does it.
[00:44:08.067 --> 00:44:10.648]  Well, I mean, Rush Limbaugh said they were just blowing off steam.
[00:44:10.708 --> 00:44:15.709]  So, I mean, that could now become the defense for serial killers and, you know, people who torture children.
[00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:22.632]  So, I mean, if the government's doing it and they're the moral authority, then why shouldn't serial killers take the same stance?
[00:44:23.232 --> 00:44:26.113]  And again, a lot of people go, well, we're fighting Al-Qaeda.
[00:44:26.133 --> 00:44:27.433]  Folks, it's Al-CIA Day.
[00:44:27.473 --> 00:44:28.193]  It's all staged.
[00:44:28.433 --> 00:44:30.674]  The people being taken out of the country are totally innocent.
[00:44:31.644 --> 00:44:41.235]  Well, the torture provides them with the basis for claiming that Al-Qaeda exists, because the people who are tortured will confess to anything, so they'll confess to being members of Al-Qaeda.
[00:44:41.255 --> 00:44:50.886]  Well, it's like these people with blood coming out of their mouths, black eyes, every night on TV, run by our government in Iraq, you know, and it's called, you know, Terrorists in the Hands of Justice.
[00:44:51.486 --> 00:44:55.527]  And these people who feature on the TV shows in Iraq are there in the first place because
[00:45:16.614 --> 00:45:20.279]  I mean, Paul, this is so nightmarish, what they're setting up.
[00:45:20.379 --> 00:45:22.782]  I mean, this is all off the charts.
[00:45:22.802 --> 00:45:25.385]  I mean, not only do these TV shows, quote, torture the terrorists...
[00:45:34.631 --> 00:45:38.916]  And then, you know, the torturer's always right, or even if he's wrong, he's still rewarded.
[00:45:39.156 --> 00:45:43.682]  Well, you tortured that man to death, but he was innocent, but still, you fought for the country.
[00:45:43.882 --> 00:45:44.963]  We're promoting you.
[00:45:45.244 --> 00:45:48.748]  But now it's these torturing children?
[00:45:50.086 --> 00:45:51.147]  Well, that's the thing.
[00:45:51.187 --> 00:45:55.531]  In most cases in these drama shows, the people that they torture turn out to be innocent.
[00:45:56.631 --> 00:46:01.315]  So that's another signal they're sending, that the people are always innocent in 90% of the cases.
[00:46:01.355 --> 00:46:04.958]  But the person that does it is rewarded and is good.
[00:46:05.579 --> 00:46:07.220]  And the person who's tortured will thank them.
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:09.742]  Thank you for torturing me to protect the country.
[00:46:10.222 --> 00:46:10.803]  Oh, that's all right.
[00:46:10.823 --> 00:46:11.644]  Let's go out to dinner.
[00:46:11.684 --> 00:46:12.104]  Good job.
[00:46:12.865 --> 00:46:25.431]  And it plays into the national obsession for heroes to protect us from the latest boogeyman, like Schwarzenegger was the hero throughout the 80s, and now it's people like, you know, Kiefer Sutherland in 24.
[00:46:25.511 --> 00:46:28.793]  He's the hero, he's going to protect us, and he has to torture to do it.
[00:46:28.813 --> 00:46:30.634]  It's a dirty world, so it has to be done.
[00:46:31.034 --> 00:46:32.655]  And it feeds that hero obsession.
[00:46:33.462 --> 00:46:36.544]  Well, yeah, I mean, the police watch these shows as well.
[00:46:36.584 --> 00:46:39.125]  I mean, all the police shows, which aren't, you know, focused around...
[00:46:55.771 --> 00:46:59.333]  The CIA or the black ops of the American intelligence like 24.
[00:46:59.473 --> 00:47:07.557]  Even in the police shows like I believe it's NYPD, Blue, others of a similar vein.
[00:47:07.797 --> 00:47:10.538]  The police torturing those as well to get information.
[00:47:11.298 --> 00:47:13.779]  Same case in Britain with the police shows over here.
[00:47:13.819 --> 00:47:17.161]  So then the police watch that and think that now that's their new role that
[00:47:18.201 --> 00:47:26.070]  They're allowed to torture, to extract whatever information they want to prevent a crime, because crime is now terrorism, as we've been told many times.
[00:47:26.090 --> 00:47:28.753]  They're the two foggily intertwined.
[00:47:28.773 --> 00:47:37.963]  Yeah, on that One Threat Matrix show a few years ago, a year and a half ago when it first came out, I was sent the episode, and the guy is a drug dealer.
[00:47:39.002 --> 00:47:44.084]  And they explained to him, we're taking your children, we're going to torture you, we're going to put you in prison for the rest of your life.
[00:47:44.104 --> 00:47:44.964]  And he goes, but I'm on a terror.
[00:47:45.004 --> 00:47:46.945]  So they go, yes, drugs are terror.
[00:47:47.525 --> 00:47:50.065]  And now, Rubik's Cube sales are terror.
[00:47:50.546 --> 00:47:52.706]  Now, complaining too much is terror.
[00:47:52.946 --> 00:47:59.048]  And the Homeland Security told the Quad City Times, well, he didn't threaten anybody, but he complained too much.
[00:47:59.388 --> 00:48:00.949]  See, they're letting you know.
[00:48:01.829 --> 00:48:04.630]  The rock star with the shirt with a gun on it.
[00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:06.231]  They go, you can't fly.
[00:48:06.291 --> 00:48:07.391]  In fact, we might arrest you.
[00:48:08.532 --> 00:48:17.099]  You know, the fellow with the sign in the front of his window, or didn't even have a sign in the front of his window, they called and said, well, we want to let you know, but the president grabs by, no signs allowed.
[00:48:17.119 --> 00:48:19.582]  He goes, you know what, I think I'll put a sign up.
[00:48:19.662 --> 00:48:22.244]  I mean, everything is terrorism now, Paul.
[00:48:23.045 --> 00:48:31.012]  Well, yeah, and you go back to the Matrix program, which labeled 400,000 American citizens as potential terrorists.
[00:48:32.424 --> 00:48:38.945]  Things like that, which were created by a cocaine smuggler who was charged back in the 80s with smuggling drugs.
[00:48:39.126 --> 00:48:44.807]  So that's the genesis of it and it flags up 400,000 American citizens as terrorists.
[00:48:45.127 --> 00:48:49.028]  Meanwhile, this secret FBI report says there are no Al Qaeda cells in America.
[00:48:49.368 --> 00:48:51.588]  So, I mean, what is the foundation?
[00:48:51.648 --> 00:48:53.148]  What is the basis of terrorism?
[00:48:53.168 --> 00:48:54.489]  And it's what you mentioned.
[00:48:54.549 --> 00:48:55.829]  It's petitioning the government.
[00:48:56.622 --> 00:49:04.046]  It's having any kind of attitude which, in the future, in the world of pre-crime, may become terrorism because you threaten the establishment.
[00:49:04.066 --> 00:49:08.948]  So the broad definition of it means that we're all terrorists in the end, if we're active.
[00:49:08.968 --> 00:49:13.450]  But meanwhile, Bush comes out and says, I don't care if Congress funded thousands of Border Patrol.
[00:49:13.890 --> 00:49:15.491]  I'm taking that money for something else.
[00:49:15.571 --> 00:49:16.752]  We're not going to hire them.
[00:49:18.052 --> 00:49:21.114]  Well, no, it's amazing that at the same time people like Condoleezza Rice
[00:49:21.954 --> 00:49:30.679]  And others say that these terrorists are being smuggled and smuggling weapons through the southern border, that they're doing absolutely nothing to secure the southern border.
[00:49:30.899 --> 00:49:40.023]  Yeah, Reuters two days ago, Secret Government Report, Time Magazine, Al-Qaeda has come across the southern border, more are coming, and they're soon going to kill kids at schools.
[00:49:41.484 --> 00:49:52.669]  When it happens and the real government ops slip out the back door and they blow some Arab's head off and leave him on the ground dead after he shoots 50 kids, after they say he did, there'll be no discussion about why was the border open.
[00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:54.290]  There'll be no discussion.
[00:49:54.650 --> 00:49:55.271]  Just stop that.
[00:49:55.451 --> 00:49:55.971]  Doesn't matter.
[00:49:57.572 --> 00:50:03.515]  And, I mean, that seems to be what they would move into under that pretext because the major big events like 9-11...
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:07.522]  Always have a thousand holes in them which people can pick apart.
[00:50:08.042 --> 00:50:14.986]  If you pick soft targets like schools and theaters, then it's harder to pick apart the evidence of what happened.
[00:50:15.006 --> 00:50:16.727]  Well, the Russians have done a great job.
[00:50:16.847 --> 00:50:22.450]  I mean, the theater attack, the Beasland attack, which is now clearly, it was the government, folks.
[00:50:24.031 --> 00:50:24.511]  It's simple.
[00:50:24.531 --> 00:50:31.034]  You have the forces surround the building, the troops inside start shooting people, they then run out the back door, then the troops shoot the innocent people.
[00:50:31.455 --> 00:50:33.876]  It's like a Columbine, and then, oh, we caught a terrorist.
[00:50:35.032 --> 00:50:44.559]  And they learned to use the soft targets after the apartment building was back in the late 90s, which they got away with, which went directly back to the government FSB.
[00:50:45.059 --> 00:50:46.840]  So, I mean, that seems to be what they're telling us.
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:50.683]  Soft targets are the future of terrorism, and it's all going to be government-sponsored.
[00:50:51.103 --> 00:50:52.264]  And also, Gladio.
[00:50:52.684 --> 00:50:54.265]  Let's talk about Gladio when we get back.
[00:50:55.646 --> 00:50:57.968]  They're talking about metal detectors in all the malls.
[00:51:01.542 --> 00:51:08.389]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.709 --> 00:51:10.071]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:10.271 --> 00:51:12.493]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:12.613 --> 00:51:14.715]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:14.996 --> 00:51:19.920]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:20.261 --> 00:51:24.305]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:24.525 --> 00:51:26.307]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:51:26.387 --> 00:51:37.037]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and viable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.197 --> 00:51:39.099]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:51:39.299 --> 00:51:43.163]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[00:51:43.263 --> 00:51:44.524]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[00:51:48.248 --> 00:51:50.311]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:50.391 --> 00:51:55.358]  Or order online at InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net.
[00:51:55.598 --> 00:51:56.319]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:52:01.098 --> 00:52:01.719]  Hello, folks.
[00:52:01.819 --> 00:52:02.719]  Alex Jones here.
[00:52:02.859 --> 00:52:06.963]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:52:07.103 --> 00:52:09.985]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:52:10.065 --> 00:52:16.790]  The powerful black Berkey verification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:52:16.971 --> 00:52:19.973]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:52:20.173 --> 00:52:22.575]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:52:22.695 --> 00:52:27.419]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove...
[00:52:27.639 --> 00:52:28.440]  We're good to go.
[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:52.580]  We're good to go.
[00:53:17.339 --> 00:53:17.739]  I think so.
[00:53:32.847 --> 00:53:33.207]  We're good to go.
[00:54:11.195 --> 00:54:14.277]  Haughty through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[00:54:14.297 --> 00:54:15.618]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:54:15.978 --> 00:54:17.759]  Paul Watson's riding shotgun with us.
[00:54:17.779 --> 00:54:20.161]  Got a big guest coming up the next hour.
[00:54:20.201 --> 00:54:21.001]  Paul, stay with us.
[00:54:21.721 --> 00:54:22.562]  Of course, your calls.
[00:54:22.582 --> 00:54:24.043]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:54:24.083 --> 00:54:32.248]  You know, me and Paul sit here and are almost jousting, just going back and forth with how bad this is.
[00:54:32.288 --> 00:54:38.992]  And believe me, I don't have words to integrate all the information into one big statement so you can see all the pieces of this.
[00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:43.714]  But we told you after 9-11, they're going to hit soft targets.
[00:54:44.675 --> 00:54:57.666]  They're going to train you about total police state in key cities, national security events, total police state in the airports, and then it's going to be the bus stops, the highways, the schools, everywhere.
[00:54:57.726 --> 00:54:59.568]  It's all turning into a lockdown.
[00:54:59.608 --> 00:55:00.209]  The bridges...
[00:55:01.167 --> 00:55:02.328]  And this is what they're doing.
[00:55:02.348 --> 00:55:03.668]  And we've got the FBI reports.
[00:55:03.708 --> 00:55:09.490]  They're going to have metal detectors and searches when you go into any of the shopping malls.
[00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:10.631]  This is going to be the new world.
[00:55:10.831 --> 00:55:11.291]  Everywhere.
[00:55:11.711 --> 00:55:13.812]  Worse than... Russia was never this bad.
[00:55:14.192 --> 00:55:15.472]  Nazi Germany, maybe.
[00:55:16.393 --> 00:55:17.413]  And here's the deal, folks.
[00:55:18.453 --> 00:55:22.835]  Of course, if it was real Al-Qaeda, if they really existed outside of the CIA, Al-Qaeda...
[00:55:23.616 --> 00:55:31.961]  As if, you know, men with machine guns, as if a security guard searching you at the entrance to the mall, as if they wouldn't just gun the security guard down.
[00:55:32.401 --> 00:55:34.902]  None of it has anything to do with security.
[00:55:35.202 --> 00:55:42.146]  Troops and checkpoints everywhere is about oppressing you and setting up a system for mass arrest and control, Paul.
[00:55:43.351 --> 00:55:44.212]  Well, that's the case.
[00:55:44.833 --> 00:55:58.205]  And the point with soft targets is that 95% of Americans don't go anywhere near and never will never have large buildings in major cities, like the World Trade Center.
[00:55:58.666 --> 00:56:08.275]  But if you attack soft targets like train station schools, which are part of people's everyday lives, then the threat is brought to their front doorstep, which is why it's so much more effective.
[00:56:08.815 --> 00:56:17.528]  Which is what Gladio was about, as you mentioned before the break, where one of the agents of it, Vincenzo Vincaguera...
[00:56:19.317 --> 00:56:25.760]  You had to attack civilians, the people, women, children, innocent people, unknown people, far removed from any political game.
[00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:27.040]  The reason was quite simple.
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:31.202]  To force the public to turn to the state to ask for greater security.
[00:56:31.282 --> 00:56:34.903]  Now, for those who don't know, I want to later in the show, after this guest is on with us, get into this.
[00:56:34.943 --> 00:56:36.384]  Because this is official.
[00:56:36.444 --> 00:56:37.264]  This is admitted.
[00:56:37.544 --> 00:56:39.085]  This is declassified.
[00:56:39.105 --> 00:56:39.685]  The U.S.
[00:56:39.825 --> 00:56:40.225]  government.
[00:56:40.836 --> 00:56:48.843]  For a decade, bombed and murdered men, women and children in Europe, predominantly in Italy, to get a police state set up there.
[00:56:49.744 --> 00:56:50.004]  Paul?
[00:56:50.825 --> 00:56:52.206]  Yeah, it was all over Europe.
[00:56:52.246 --> 00:56:55.229]  It was Italy, France, West Germany, Greece.
[00:56:56.149 --> 00:57:06.018]  And it was called the Strategy of Tension, fermenting fear to keep the populations in awe of strongmen who vowed to protect them from the terrorists.
[00:57:06.687 --> 00:57:15.830]  And read what the man who later became the head of their security services, and of course their president, former president, has said this too, but read what he said about it again.
[00:57:17.011 --> 00:57:23.913]  He said, you had to attack civilians, the people, women, children, innocent people, unknown people, far removed from any political game.
[00:57:23.933 --> 00:57:29.535]  The reason was quite simple, to force the public to turn to the state to ask for greater security.
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:47.331]  Then there's the Pentagon document field manual FM 3031B which states US Army intelligence must have the means of launching special operations which will convince host country governments and public opinion of the reality of the insurgent danger.
[00:57:47.792 --> 00:57:51.054]  So again that smacks of Operation Northwoods.
[00:57:51.154 --> 00:57:53.916]  It's got similar rhetoric and it has the same purpose.
[00:57:55.382 --> 00:57:58.004]  Paul, folks better wake up out there and realize this is not even a radical broadcast.
[00:58:23.689 --> 00:58:27.730]  What we've got with mainstream media is just radical, dumbed-down garbage.
[00:58:28.770 --> 00:58:34.351]  Well, I mean, when this kind of thing is on the National Security Archive website, how radical is it?
[00:58:36.932 --> 00:58:39.032]  We just want to save these women and children, folks.
[00:58:39.092 --> 00:58:42.173]  I mean, really, it makes me... I get sick at my stomach thinking about these killers.
[00:58:42.553 --> 00:58:43.213]  They're out there.
[00:58:43.253 --> 00:58:44.293]  They're getting more power.
[00:58:44.793 --> 00:58:45.994]  The events are getting bigger.
[00:58:46.534 --> 00:58:49.334]  And then we have to watch them pose as our saviors after they do it.
[00:58:49.394 --> 00:58:50.395]  Second hour coming up.
[00:58:51.615 --> 00:58:52.115]  Berkey Water.
[00:58:58.113 --> 00:58:58.753]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.413 --> 00:59:00.454]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.174 --> 00:59:02.275]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.935 --> 00:59:03.755]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.516 --> 00:59:05.396]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.416 --> 00:59:09.758]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.258 --> 00:59:14.380]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.421 --> 00:59:19.743]  All right, into the second hour, 16th day of March, 05, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:21.531 --> 00:59:29.278]  Riding the shotgun with us for the broadcast today is Paul Joseph Watson, the webmaster for PrisonPlanta.com and PrisonPlanta.tv, two of my great websites.
[00:59:30.979 --> 00:59:43.250]  And we've got Jim Rothstein, who is a New York detective and at the highest levels of state government investigating the government-run white slavery rings, but every time he was about to bust high-level people, he was told to stop it.
[00:59:44.235 --> 00:59:44.895]  That's coming up.
[00:59:45.255 --> 00:59:48.577]  Right now, Paul, let's go ahead and get to some of these calls that have been holding for eons.
[00:59:49.157 --> 00:59:52.079]  John in Alaska, and then Robert in Colorado.
[00:59:52.099 --> 00:59:52.819]  John, go ahead.
[00:59:53.539 --> 00:59:54.099]  Hello, Alex.
[00:59:54.340 --> 00:59:54.620]  Hello.
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:55.400]  Hello, Paul.
[00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:56.881]  Hello.
[00:59:57.621 --> 00:59:58.802]  I have a comment and a question.
[00:59:58.862 --> 01:00:12.928]  I find it interesting that I was in a shower this morning listening to a presidential press conference on UPN Network News, and the president was explaining why Iran now needs to develop democracy
[01:00:14.937 --> 01:00:20.522]  What he wasn't saying was he was trying to develop a pretext to go invade Iran now.
[01:00:20.923 --> 01:00:24.826]  He says, oh, by the way, we're a country that doesn't believe in torture.
[01:00:26.728 --> 01:00:29.250]  He just made that little bit of a slur right there.
[01:00:29.330 --> 01:00:31.532]  Oh, by the way, we don't believe in torturing our people.
[01:00:33.126 --> 01:00:35.647]  Yeah, he's saying that Iran does it.
[01:00:36.107 --> 01:00:43.588]  Well, saying Saddam did it when our government trained him and helped him do it and helped build the camps, and then our troops moved back into the camps that our government helped build.
[01:00:44.888 --> 01:00:58.091]  Yeah, and our lovely President, Xavier Bush, according to UPN Network News, reportedly said this in a press conference this morning that he held.
[01:00:58.111 --> 01:01:01.052]  He just flippantly added that.
[01:01:01.672 --> 01:01:02.172]  Yeah, he did.
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:02.880]  You did.
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.001]  I heard it come out of his own mouth.
[01:01:06.021 --> 01:01:09.682]  I have a question to add to all this.
[01:01:10.282 --> 01:01:24.907]  A friend of mine and I were talking and we were going over all the Rush Limbogs and we were going over your show and all the other shows that we listen to and government scandals and all this.
[01:01:26.155 --> 01:01:29.736]  He said, well, why don't we just start a civil war?
[01:01:29.796 --> 01:01:32.897]  It's not happening peacefully, so we might as well bear arms and all that.
[01:01:32.957 --> 01:01:41.279]  Well, what would you say to the average listener out there that's getting in on this so that we won't get that one nutball out there that goes and shoots a cop?
[01:01:41.639 --> 01:01:43.439]  I'm not for violence offensively.
[01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:50.041]  Look, we have a right to defend ourselves, but the globalists have to create violence and then blame it on patriots.
[01:01:50.421 --> 01:01:53.262]  The last thing we want is to play into what they're doing.
[01:01:54.105 --> 01:01:58.467]  Now, if the government starts trying to do mass arrests and really tries to turn the heat up, you've got to defend yourself.
[01:02:00.007 --> 01:02:00.567]  Right, right.
[01:02:00.587 --> 01:02:02.008]  I just wanted to hear it from you.
[01:02:02.188 --> 01:02:02.408]  Sure.
[01:02:02.488 --> 01:02:03.429]  Paul, you want to comment on that?
[01:02:04.189 --> 01:02:06.190]  Well, yeah, it's more of a waiting game.
[01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:10.591]  I mean, Gandhi kicked the British out of India by playing the waiting game.
[01:02:10.631 --> 01:02:15.213]  You know, he said, first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[01:02:15.553 --> 01:02:19.595]  Which reminds me of what Popular Mechanics did, as we had an article up about that the other day.
[01:02:19.615 --> 01:02:21.915]  So it's a waiting game.
[01:02:21.935 --> 01:02:23.256]  Say that again, because it's true.
[01:02:24.036 --> 01:02:28.658]  First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[01:02:29.938 --> 01:02:31.339]  You make them get desperate.
[01:02:31.359 --> 01:02:36.481]  Every time they crack our skulls, every time they do mean stuff, they just look worse and worse.
[01:02:36.521 --> 01:02:37.522]  We're winning, by the way.
[01:02:38.102 --> 01:02:39.722]  I'm here to tell you, John, we are winning.
[01:02:40.743 --> 01:02:45.665]  Why can't we do things like boycott CSI and all these other shows?
[01:02:46.125 --> 01:02:47.406]  Hey, I totally agree.
[01:02:47.706 --> 01:02:49.807]  Listen, boycott television predominantly.
[01:02:50.147 --> 01:02:51.767]  I don't watch television.
[01:02:51.807 --> 01:02:53.128]  The TV should be locked up.
[01:02:54.668 --> 01:02:56.409]  And roll it out occasionally, you know.
[01:02:56.449 --> 01:02:59.210]  I mean, there's nothing wrong with watching an occasional football game.
[01:02:59.430 --> 01:03:01.091]  But it should be a special treat.
[01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:03.692]  And you shouldn't just watch it four hours a night.
[01:03:04.492 --> 01:03:09.254]  I think it's interesting when you've got kids that are raised on MTV and, you know.
[01:03:09.995 --> 01:03:13.078]  Over half of the marriages end in divorce, that kind of thing.
[01:03:13.318 --> 01:03:15.140]  And, you know, no wonder.
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:23.607]  Yeah, people are supposed to be interfacing, talking, going on walks, walking in the garden, fixing the house, cleaning out the closet.
[01:03:23.947 --> 01:03:27.530]  I mean, we're not fulfilled sitting there watching television.
[01:03:27.550 --> 01:03:33.655]  We're supposed to be fishing and playing golf and going to the Little League game, not sucking our thumbs watching television.
[01:03:33.836 --> 01:03:35.737]  Or what about the violence in Nintendo games?
[01:03:35.797 --> 01:03:35.998]  I mean...
[01:03:37.878 --> 01:03:38.519]  Thanks for the call.
[01:03:38.939 --> 01:03:39.359]  We'll be back.
[01:03:39.379 --> 01:03:40.319]  We've got a guest coming up.
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:41.860]  And your calls as well.
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:44.801]  It's going to be a jam-packed broadcast.
[01:03:45.241 --> 01:03:47.642]  We've got an hour and 55 minutes left, so stay with us.
[01:03:54.365 --> 01:03:57.226]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:03:58.050 --> 01:03:58.811]  We're good to go.
[01:04:12.790 --> 01:04:15.191]  This program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:04:15.351 --> 01:04:19.133]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[01:04:19.373 --> 01:04:24.015]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:04:24.115 --> 01:04:30.377]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:04:30.417 --> 01:04:32.238]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[01:04:50.451 --> 01:04:52.513]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:04:53.473 --> 01:04:54.253]  Terrorism.
[01:04:54.393 --> 01:04:55.134]  Terrorism.
[01:04:55.254 --> 01:04:56.074]  Chemical attacks.
[01:04:56.154 --> 01:04:56.834]  Dirty bombs.
[01:04:56.914 --> 01:04:57.315]  Fallout.
[01:04:57.415 --> 01:04:58.415]  Biological attack.
[01:04:58.575 --> 01:04:59.115]  Anthrax.
[01:04:59.195 --> 01:05:01.296]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:05:01.556 --> 01:05:03.157]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:05:03.397 --> 01:05:05.878]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:05:06.278 --> 01:05:20.844]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:20.884 --> 01:05:21.204]  government.
[01:05:21.364 --> 01:05:23.165]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:05:23.545 --> 01:05:29.448]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:29.588 --> 01:05:34.111]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.

[01:05:53.141 --> 01:05:56.825]  My doctor was truly amazed at the improvements my heart showed after my heart attack.
[01:05:57.105 --> 01:05:58.286]  Thank you, Cardivite.
[01:05:58.346 --> 01:06:03.311]  I was having a hard time breathing and had to rest in the afternoons, but since Cardivite, that's all changed now.
[01:06:03.392 --> 01:06:06.955]  I've had chronic fatigue for 12 years now and decided to try Cardivite.
[01:06:07.015 --> 01:06:08.977]  Boy, it's improved my energy dramatically.
[01:06:08.997 --> 01:06:10.038]  Cardivite.
[01:06:10.098 --> 01:06:11.620]  We all use Cardivite!

[01:06:53.337 --> 01:06:58.399]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.739 --> 01:07:01.100]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:03.761 --> 01:07:10.544]  The New World Order controllers need us to at least share part of their mindset.
[01:07:12.185 --> 01:07:15.266]  That's why they're selling us that torture and secret arrest is good.
[01:07:16.907 --> 01:07:19.968]  That's why they're telling us that getting rid of the Bill of Rights is wonderful.
[01:07:20.737 --> 01:07:33.160]  That's why they tell us that, oh, good peace officers wear black helmets and black masks and drive big black armored vehicles and we build lots of prisons with barbed wire all over them for you because we want to keep you safe.
[01:07:35.081 --> 01:07:49.405]  Last hour we talked about USA Today and the New York Times lauding the show 24 on Fox, just one of scores that promote torture and where on these shows they torture children and people torture their children.
[01:07:50.046 --> 01:07:53.147]  And torturing the people, even in some cases to death, is good.
[01:07:53.167 --> 01:08:01.188]  They have shows in England, like Spooks, that we've covered here and played clips of, where they torture an eight-year-old girl to make the father answer questions.
[01:08:01.668 --> 01:08:05.009]  And they're lauded, the agents are, for torturing the children.
[01:08:06.189 --> 01:08:15.651]  So to show you how warped the elite is, I mean, just look at what they're promoting through their own programs, and then the government in the real world says, yes, we're torturing children.
[01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:21.392]  At Abu Ghraib and other places around the world to, quote, make suspected terrorists talk.
[01:08:22.353 --> 01:08:25.595]  And then when you see the images of torture, they slap on the wrist.
[01:08:25.655 --> 01:08:27.116]  They're minions that follow the orders.
[01:08:27.456 --> 01:08:32.679]  We get the White House orders, and Gonzalez gets up and never apologizes and says, yeah, we're above the law.
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:38.823]  Yeah, we can torture somebody until the point they die, and if we didn't mean to kill them, it's not torture.
[01:08:39.583 --> 01:08:41.704]  Torturing people to death is okay.
[01:08:41.724 --> 01:08:42.325]  That's the memo.
[01:08:43.666 --> 01:08:45.807]  That's what's happening, but notice they don't go to jail.
[01:08:46.694 --> 01:08:49.775]  No, they just expand on it, promote it, and push it.
[01:08:51.156 --> 01:08:57.138]  And if you feel safe with a Joseph Mengele-style government that will torture you, you've got a very serious problem, folks.
[01:08:57.879 --> 01:09:00.580]  This will not keep you safe from Al-Ciata.
[01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:03.001]  So I wanted to bring that back up again.
[01:09:03.021 --> 01:09:08.243]  We have Paul Watson, our contributor, webmaster for PrisonPlanet.com, riding shotgun with us.
[01:09:08.923 --> 01:09:10.804]  And we've got Jim Rothstein.
[01:09:12.125 --> 01:09:22.176]  It was a highly decorated New York detective, was on the governor's board investigating all this horrible stuff that I don't like talking about but has to be discussed.
[01:09:24.138 --> 01:09:28.964]  We're talking about kidnapping of children, pedophilia, government-run white slavery rings.
[01:09:29.617 --> 01:09:32.058]  And the UN's been caught doing it in every country they're in.
[01:09:32.138 --> 01:09:34.459]  I mean, industrialized.
[01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:44.144]  200,000 women and children kidnapped by DynCorp, put on aircraft, taken out of the country to Malaysia, to Saudi Arabia, to Israel.
[01:09:44.464 --> 01:09:46.185]  I mean, this is massive, folks.
[01:09:46.225 --> 01:09:47.766]  This is huge.
[01:09:48.566 --> 01:09:50.327]  And it's not as big here in the U.S.
[01:09:50.367 --> 01:09:51.288]  as it is overseas.
[01:09:51.828 --> 01:09:54.089]  Where they have these police states, it's rampant.
[01:09:55.032 --> 01:10:00.233]  And that's why we're fighting this so these sickos don't think that America is a happy hunting ground for them.
[01:10:01.693 --> 01:10:02.734]  We're in deep trouble, folks.
[01:10:02.874 --> 01:10:04.574]  Hell is being released upon the earth.
[01:10:04.934 --> 01:10:07.394]  Jim Rothstein, thank you so much for joining us, sir.
[01:10:07.775 --> 01:10:08.655]  Thanks for having me.
[01:10:09.615 --> 01:10:17.256]  We really see the serial killers that run the country and the government trying to go public and sell us on their mindset right now, Jim.
[01:10:17.937 --> 01:10:18.817]  Yes, that's true.
[01:10:18.857 --> 01:10:19.917]  You'll see a lot of that.
[01:10:21.148 --> 01:10:24.649]  Just for those that just joined us, you can talk about yourself better than I can.
[01:10:24.689 --> 01:10:28.191]  Tell us a little bit about Jim Rothstein and how you got involved.
[01:10:28.691 --> 01:10:47.118]  Well, I was a detective with the New York City Police Department, and before I became a detective, about 68, 69, I was working in a plainclothes assignment, and that's when I first got into it, when they were bringing the girls in from the Midwest for prostitution.
[01:10:48.099 --> 01:11:13.964]  And I started seeing a big movement of that and I started following it and keeping records and eventually they ended up killing a police officer and that's how I got brought in because I was the only one who was keeping records on it and at that time there were thousands of young ladies from the Midwest brought into New York, Columbus, Ohio and other places around the United States and they would move these kids all over the country.
[01:11:14.464 --> 01:11:15.484]  Many of them disappeared.
[01:11:15.504 --> 01:11:15.564]  I'm
[01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:22.242]  What was the average age of these underage girls?
[01:11:22.622 --> 01:11:26.143]  Anywhere from 13 to 16, 17.
[01:11:26.643 --> 01:11:28.263]  That was usually when they picked them up.
[01:11:28.363 --> 01:11:41.667]  In fact, we had a place in Minnesota where they had a home for wayward girls, and we actually found that these pimps were going up there and picking the girls up and then putting them into the market.
[01:11:42.587 --> 01:11:44.468]  And eventually, though, we were able, with
[01:11:45.014 --> 01:11:55.516]  For once, the FBI is probably the only time I ever saw the FBI do an investigation totally, and we worked with the IRS, and we put 11 of the top 12 pimps in prison.
[01:11:56.277 --> 01:12:02.118]  And they got various times, but it basically broke this whole problem.
[01:12:02.138 --> 01:12:04.678]  But let's face it, they got in trouble because they killed a cop.
[01:12:05.119 --> 01:12:10.820]  Well, that was what started it, and that's how I got into it, and eventually, years later, this was in the...
[01:12:11.761 --> 01:12:16.904]  Early 70s then, we were finally able to... Well, do me a favor, Detective Rothstein.
[01:12:16.924 --> 01:12:18.424]  Describe how they killed this officer.
[01:12:19.525 --> 01:12:27.309]  This police officer was making an arrest on a prostitute and the pimp came up and stabbed him to death.
[01:12:28.349 --> 01:12:32.031]  And that's how that came about and that really got everything going.
[01:12:32.571 --> 01:12:40.375]  And then I got put on a special squad to work this and eventually I got a number of partners to work with me and then we were able to convince the feds
[01:12:40.936 --> 01:12:41.697]  To get involved.
[01:12:41.798 --> 01:12:43.200]  And it was a dynamite case.
[01:12:44.522 --> 01:12:49.231]  For once, it shows that if police authorities do work together, there's nothing they can't stop.
[01:12:50.015 --> 01:12:52.296]  Okay, now I heard you on Jack Blood's show last Friday.
[01:12:52.336 --> 01:12:53.076]  It was riveting.
[01:12:54.076 --> 01:12:57.797]  And I've since done some research and pulled up some news articles, Jim, that you were in.
[01:12:58.437 --> 01:13:07.759]  But now, you started really investigating after this, but you found an apartment full of all these children, including boys, and then it led up to some higher-level people.
[01:13:07.819 --> 01:13:11.100]  What would happen to you every time you got really to the heart of things?
[01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:12.260]  Well, we got stopped.
[01:13:12.341 --> 01:13:18.302]  And what was interesting, once we were working on the girls' end of this, we got into the little boy network.
[01:13:18.909 --> 01:13:28.812]  In this particular case, a guy by the name of Willie Dunn, one of the most notorious pedophile pimps in the country at that time, was in an apartment on West 45th Street.
[01:13:29.452 --> 01:13:32.933]  I don't know how many kids were in the apartment anymore, but there were quite a number.
[01:13:33.733 --> 01:13:39.195]  And technically, at that time, there was nothing we could do because there were no violations.
[01:13:39.235 --> 01:13:42.936]  Most of these kids that were in that apartment that day were around 15 years old.
[01:13:43.716 --> 01:13:48.057]  And at that point, I was a uniformed police officer, and I turned it over to the detectives.
[01:13:48.749 --> 01:13:50.310]  And then the case disappeared.
[01:13:50.930 --> 01:13:52.912]  And that was the way it was handled at the time.
[01:13:52.972 --> 01:13:56.474]  But years later, I ran into this guy a number of times.
[01:13:56.534 --> 01:14:06.680]  And at one point, we actually arrested him where he had stolen a motorhome and was traveling around the country kidnapping, buying, and selling kids.
[01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:11.343]  And every time I put this guy in jail, somehow or other, he'd walk again.
[01:14:11.383 --> 01:14:13.244]  We convicted him in Norfolk, Virginia.
[01:14:14.668 --> 01:14:18.029]  On an offshoot of this, using stolen credit cards.
[01:14:18.049 --> 01:14:22.530]  I'm not calling for torturing somebody like that, but it's too bad he didn't fall down and hit his head.
[01:14:23.150 --> 01:14:31.732]  Well, there was a lot of people that thought that at the time that would have been the proper thing to do, but I always had a belief that if you're as bad as they are, you can never... No, you know what?
[01:14:31.812 --> 01:14:32.433]  I agree with you.
[01:14:32.473 --> 01:14:35.373]  As soon as you turn into them, this is how it happens.
[01:14:35.393 --> 01:14:40.074]  I want to bring Paul Watson in, who's riding shotgun with us, and then we'll continue with his story.
[01:14:40.134 --> 01:14:42.235]  Paul, do you have any questions for Detective Rothstein?
[01:14:43.354 --> 01:14:44.355]  Well, yeah, just a comment.
[01:14:44.395 --> 01:14:51.719]  Basically, we've got the archive on prisonplanet.com where this kind of mirrors the track record globally.
[01:14:51.759 --> 01:14:57.803]  I mean, cases from France, Portugal, Australia, Bosnia, Chile, Belgium.
[01:14:58.884 --> 01:15:13.818]  You have the same case where the involvement of high-level individuals, judges who are even involved in the cases themselves, politicians, heads of corporations, even TV personalities are involved and that's the point when the case gets shut down.
[01:15:14.338 --> 01:15:24.562]  They always seem to burn the handler and protect the clients, like Dutro in Belgium with that big case of child prostitution.
[01:15:25.103 --> 01:15:29.164]  He was burned, but the judges, the politicians that were involved, were completely protected.
[01:15:29.204 --> 01:15:31.505]  Now, that was killing toddlers.
[01:15:31.545 --> 01:15:33.806]  That's a good point to bring up to Jim Rothstein.
[01:15:33.846 --> 01:15:37.788]  Detective, in how many of these cases did it deal with really small children?
[01:15:38.448 --> 01:15:40.109]  We didn't run into that too much.
[01:15:40.489 --> 01:15:41.310]  We did have...
[01:15:42.994 --> 01:15:45.636]  Uh, information about things like that happening.
[01:15:46.116 --> 01:15:58.262]  And in one particular case, after I had retired, I was up in Maine, and two local priests came to me where a woman had been approached to sacrifice her, I guess the kid was about three months old,
[01:15:59.034 --> 01:16:03.458]  And they just happened to know that I had retired from the police department and came to me.
[01:16:03.858 --> 01:16:09.123]  So we know that this is actually happening in different parts of the country and has been for many years.
[01:16:09.183 --> 01:16:12.426]  This was about 1988 when I was approached by them.
[01:16:14.087 --> 01:16:15.308]  Well, it's unbelievable.
[01:16:15.909 --> 01:16:17.970]  And, of course, I'm sure you're familiar with John DeCamp.
[01:16:18.011 --> 01:16:19.111]  We got him on Monday.
[01:16:19.152 --> 01:16:19.472]  Senator?
[01:16:19.772 --> 01:16:23.255]  Yes, I know him well, and he's doing a tremendous job.
[01:16:23.335 --> 01:16:25.017]  I hear he's not feeling good right now.
[01:16:25.217 --> 01:16:26.338]  Yeah, he just had major surgery.
[01:16:26.358 --> 01:16:26.578]  Yeah.
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:33.504]  But no, John is, I credit him for the years that he has worked on this, trying to expose it.
[01:16:34.045 --> 01:16:37.427]  And John has suffered a great toll with the fine work he has done.
[01:16:38.608 --> 01:16:41.270]  You don't work this stuff and not get hassled.
[01:16:41.490 --> 01:16:42.530]  This is what's strange.
[01:16:42.991 --> 01:16:52.077]  All the years I worked this, at the end, when I was retired from the police department, they tried to buy me, they tried to threaten me, they did everything.
[01:16:52.597 --> 01:16:56.620]  And there's other police officers, as myself, who the same thing happens to.
[01:16:57.370 --> 01:17:02.814]  And all the shows and stuff I do, I always say, why can't these police officers call in?
[01:17:03.354 --> 01:17:04.935]  We can give them the help they need.
[01:17:05.555 --> 01:17:12.520]  And I've said this many times, that build the mothers, force the husbands to do what they're supposed to.
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:16.022]  These children cases will continue going on and on.
[01:17:16.563 --> 01:17:18.023]  Only the people can stop this.
[01:17:18.284 --> 01:17:21.506]  And they have to put the heat on the government to make them stop it.
[01:17:21.566 --> 01:17:23.347]  And as you know from the shows you've done,
[01:17:23.891 --> 01:17:28.896]  That this leads right up to the highest people, not only in our country, state, and everything else.
[01:17:28.976 --> 01:17:33.020]  It goes into the international field, and it has to be stopped.
[01:17:34.241 --> 01:17:40.607]  Now, what are we talking about a year of really, children that are really kidnapped by these people, a couple thousand?
[01:17:41.368 --> 01:17:44.551]  Well, again, it goes into different things.
[01:17:44.611 --> 01:17:48.455]  If you consider the family abductions that take place, you know where the
[01:17:49.102 --> 01:17:52.364]  Husband and wife are fighting, and they're going to relatives, and they take kids.
[01:17:52.384 --> 01:17:53.885]  There's hundreds of thousands of those.
[01:17:54.065 --> 01:18:08.794]  Yeah, and then what we were at that time, now you've got to remember this was in the 70s and 80s, early 80s, there were what we were able to pretty accurately describe a minimum, there were at least 200 kids a year, up to 500.
[01:18:09.255 --> 01:18:14.058]  I don't know where it would be right now, but I'd say it's gone way up there by now.
[01:18:14.298 --> 01:18:14.738]  That have...
[01:18:15.162 --> 01:18:21.436]  We've fallen into this group, similar as Johnny Goss, Jacob Wetterling, and the list goes on and on.
[01:18:22.378 --> 01:18:27.460]  Our kids that end into a network, as John DeCamp had described in his investigation.
[01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:36.104]  When we get back, you mention orphanages, you mention groups of children that have been taken by protective services, and then they end up in these people's hands.
[01:18:36.744 --> 01:18:46.269]  That's the MO we've got from a lot of mainstream news articles over the years that are in our files and posted in these sections on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:18:46.609 --> 01:18:47.669]  Jim Rothstein, stay there.
[01:18:47.729 --> 01:18:48.690]  Paul Watson, stay with us.
[01:18:49.070 --> 01:18:51.111]  We'll continue exploring this when we get back.
[01:18:54.318 --> 01:18:55.779]  To the farthest corners of the Earth.
[01:18:56.079 --> 01:19:00.680]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[01:19:00.981 --> 01:19:03.341]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[01:19:03.582 --> 01:19:05.102]  Achieve financial independence.
[01:19:05.482 --> 01:19:10.564]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[01:19:10.884 --> 01:19:12.105]  Get the Red Book of U.S.
[01:19:12.165 --> 01:19:14.866]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.
[01:19:15.246 --> 01:19:21.971]  Right now, Midas Resources is offering the 2005 edition of the Red Book, along with a silver dollar for only $22.95.

[01:19:54.510 --> 01:19:57.031]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:19:57.731 --> 01:20:02.894]  Have you ever been told that communism has collapsed and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty?
[01:20:03.806 --> 01:20:10.690]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[01:20:11.730 --> 01:20:20.334]  If so, why is Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in preparation for an attack to end capitalism?
[01:20:21.455 --> 01:20:29.399]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:30.897 --> 01:20:32.719]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[01:20:32.739 --> 01:20:33.099]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:20:33.119 --> 01:20:33.359]  Call now.
[01:20:33.399 --> 01:20:39.564]  Operators are standing by to receive your order for a free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:54.835 --> 01:20:59.339]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:20:59.679 --> 01:21:03.783]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:21:04.083 --> 01:21:04.624]  We listened.
[01:21:04.924 --> 01:21:09.908]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:21:10.189 --> 01:21:10.669]  We listened.
[01:21:11.049 --> 01:21:14.092]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:21:14.532 --> 01:21:15.033]  We listened.
[01:21:15.493 --> 01:21:19.574]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:21:19.934 --> 01:21:20.434]  We listened.
[01:21:20.774 --> 01:21:26.015]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:21:26.435 --> 01:21:27.795]  Again, we listened.
[01:21:28.156 --> 01:21:35.537]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:21:35.917 --> 01:21:39.378]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter for only $259 by calling
[01:21:45.399 --> 01:21:49.020]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:21:49.901 --> 01:21:51.301]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:21:53.382 --> 01:21:54.442]  Are you losing your hair?
[01:21:54.762 --> 01:21:56.223]  Is that bald spot getting bigger?
[01:21:56.543 --> 01:21:57.724]  Is your hair looking thinner?
[01:21:58.224 --> 01:22:04.706]  Why aren't you using Avacor, the hair growth treatment that has helped thousands of people just like you regrow their hair?
[01:22:05.046 --> 01:22:08.067]  I've been using Avacor now for four months, and it's a great product.
[01:22:08.187 --> 01:22:10.268]  They back everything with a money-back guarantee.
[01:22:10.608 --> 01:22:11.329]  It works.
[01:22:11.709 --> 01:22:14.210]  My hair hasn't looked this good in over 15 years.
[01:22:15.738 --> 01:22:20.542]  If you're losing your hair and haven't tried Avacor yet, how about a free month's supply?
[01:22:20.762 --> 01:22:24.465]  We're giving away a free month of Avacor with all of today's orders.
[01:22:24.805 --> 01:22:28.968]  Avacor is proven to successfully stop hair loss and regrow hair.
[01:22:29.548 --> 01:22:34.972]  Even if hair loss runs in the family, Avacor can help you regrow your own natural hair.
[01:22:34.992 --> 01:22:35.513]  Call 1-800-548-5910.
[01:22:35.533 --> 01:22:35.873]  That's 1-800-548-5910.
[01:22:41.537 --> 01:22:43.738]  Think how far we've fallen already.
[01:22:43.838 --> 01:22:45.639]  There's a lot further we can fall.
[01:22:45.779 --> 01:22:50.000]  My friends, think what we've turned into since our founding fathers founded this country.
[01:23:11.218 --> 01:23:15.199]  We're talking to Jim Rothstein, retired New York City detective.
[01:23:16.119 --> 01:23:22.620]  And Jim, you were later even on a gubernatorial board investigating this, were you not?
[01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:39.903]  Yes, in 1976, the governor of New York at the time, Kerry, appointed me to the New York State Select Committee on Crime and my partner, Maddie Rosenthal, and we were assigned to look at what the effects this was having on society.
[01:23:40.529 --> 01:23:44.890]  And it was a very good intended program and we were doing investigation.
[01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:48.430]  We were doing quite well in getting the things put together.
[01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:55.151]  We even had at one point where we brought in girls from all over the United States to testify in front of the full committee.
[01:23:57.052 --> 01:24:03.853]  And then when we started on the pedophile stuff with the males, we were shut down very quickly.
[01:24:04.453 --> 01:24:09.894]  We, in fact, at one point had gone for a wiretap order on one of the biggest callboy
[01:24:10.783 --> 01:24:15.566]  Operations running in the United States at that time, which ran right into Washington, D.C.
[01:24:16.266 --> 01:24:25.812]  And at that time, Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan prosecutor, district attorney, wouldn't give us the order.
[01:24:25.872 --> 01:24:30.754]  And then his office went in and raided it and took all the files, which is the important thing.
[01:24:31.615 --> 01:24:34.036]  Once you get the files, you know where it leads to.
[01:24:34.316 --> 01:24:37.278]  And we got stopped right after that, yes.
[01:24:38.334 --> 01:24:40.795]  And so they went in to get the material to cover it up.
[01:24:41.135 --> 01:24:41.615]  That's right.
[01:24:41.835 --> 01:24:54.979]  It was a full cover-up, and he's running for Attorney General, not Attorney General, for District Attorney in New York this year, so if there's anybody in New York listening, there's a guy you've got to get rid of.
[01:24:55.980 --> 01:24:59.961]  Well, we have three affiliates in upstate New York, but... This is Manhattan.
[01:25:00.021 --> 01:25:00.621]  Yeah, I know.
[01:25:00.821 --> 01:25:02.662]  Unfortunately, we're not on in Manhattan, we wish.
[01:25:02.842 --> 01:25:03.022]  Now...
[01:25:04.797 --> 01:25:07.099]  Look, Barney Frank, I mean, how many years ago was it?
[01:25:07.119 --> 01:25:12.564]  It was on the nightly news that there was an underage cowboy ring being run out of his penthouse in D.C.
[01:25:12.844 --> 01:25:18.789]  Yes, we actually had gotten into that in the early 70s already with the connections to Washington.
[01:25:19.149 --> 01:25:20.951]  So Frank's name was coming up then?
[01:25:21.351 --> 01:25:28.357]  Yes, and not only his name, but later on in the 70s, Shanley, the priest who was with Nambla, his name came up.
[01:25:28.397 --> 01:25:30.079]  You know, they just convicted him up there.
[01:25:30.638 --> 01:25:34.280]  And we tried to go after them, and at that point, you could do nothing to these people.
[01:25:35.961 --> 01:25:42.184]  It's unbelievable, and with these priests getting busted, and thank God they are, it's not going high enough.
[01:25:42.684 --> 01:25:45.566]  That's right, and we started an investigation.
[01:25:46.526 --> 01:25:57.632]  In 78, actually, is when we went into it with a priest by the name of Father Bruce Ritter, who had gotten a special dispensation from the church to clean this mess up.
[01:25:58.372 --> 01:25:59.553]  Well, what happened is...
[01:26:01.717 --> 01:26:06.419]  He ended up being accused of being a pedophile himself to stop him.
[01:26:06.459 --> 01:26:10.001]  And that happened after I left the state of New York, otherwise they'd have never touched him.
[01:26:10.541 --> 01:26:17.965]  But he had been ordered by the church in 78 by John Paul... Well, for those that just joined us, that was what, the mid-90s, the Barney Frank thing?
[01:26:18.285 --> 01:26:18.505]  Yeah.
[01:26:18.605 --> 01:26:19.486]  And it was admitted.
[01:26:19.506 --> 01:26:21.287]  He said, oh, I'm sorry, it's a mistake.
[01:26:21.367 --> 01:26:27.010]  I mean, a full-bore pedophile ran out of his... I mean, these people are above the law.
[01:26:27.050 --> 01:26:27.610]  Paul Watson...
[01:26:28.385 --> 01:26:48.461]  Well, the thing that gets me about it is that we have all this evidence of government figures being involved in this, and yet then they'll go and legislate things like a certain amount of adopted children need to be adopted to homosexual couples when the facts are that, I mean, what is it, they're 300% more likely to abuse.
[01:26:49.061 --> 01:26:54.906]  And then another example is one of my relatives who works in the schools doing theatre productions.
[01:26:54.926 --> 01:26:57.248]  I don't know if this is the same case in America.
[01:26:58.068 --> 01:27:01.851]  But it is a criminal offense to have contact with the children.
[01:27:01.971 --> 01:27:06.954]  If they run up and try to hug you, then it is a criminal offense even to have contact with them.
[01:27:07.294 --> 01:27:12.637]  And this legislation is coming down from the same government who is involved in all this at these high levels.
[01:27:13.017 --> 01:27:15.018]  So again, it's total hypocrisy.
[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:18.461]  Jim, is that your experience?
[01:27:18.761 --> 01:27:24.124]  Well, yes, and there's a whole scandal waiting to break yet, and not only in this country but around.
[01:27:24.662 --> 01:27:25.863]  Has to do with the schools.
[01:27:25.903 --> 01:27:33.189]  You're starting to see a few popping up here and there now where some teachers are being accused of going with the children.
[01:27:34.150 --> 01:27:37.092]  This is far bigger than anything that's come out yet.
[01:27:37.212 --> 01:27:43.598]  And then the second one is the social services where they place the children, the adoption stuff.
[01:27:43.678 --> 01:27:48.282]  As you saw, there's been some cases down in Florida and other places around the country.
[01:27:48.382 --> 01:27:50.904]  This is a real big scandal waiting to break.
[01:27:51.303 --> 01:27:56.527]  There have been cases in Oregon where the young 12-year-old girl is crying.
[01:27:56.927 --> 01:28:04.994]  She's been taken from the Christian family, given to lesbians, and then the lesbians openly beat the mother in front of police laughing on the courthouse steps.
[01:28:05.014 --> 01:28:09.938]  Then the girl escapes a month later in chains, running to the police department in chains.
[01:28:10.198 --> 01:28:12.400]  They give them back to the women, and the girl's never seen again.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.343]  Well, I haven't heard of that case, but there are a lot of these cases.
[01:28:16.803 --> 01:28:20.346]  And this goes back to when I was working where one of my best informants
[01:28:20.856 --> 01:28:23.297]  Had in fact been molested when he was in a home.
[01:28:23.857 --> 01:28:25.698]  That's what got him into this underground.
[01:28:27.558 --> 01:28:29.499]  Folks, it is such a nightmare.
[01:28:29.859 --> 01:28:30.919]  And it is there.
[01:28:31.019 --> 01:28:31.760]  It is breeding.
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:32.600]  It is growing.
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:33.700]  We must fight it.
[01:28:35.001 --> 01:28:37.502]  We've got a responsibility to defend the innocent.
[01:28:37.522 --> 01:28:39.982]  And the devil hates the innocent.
[01:28:40.002 --> 01:28:40.703]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:44.244 --> 01:28:45.184]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.644 --> 01:28:47.165]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.152 --> 01:28:50.934]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.097 --> 01:28:59.321]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:28:59.461 --> 01:29:07.568]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:29:07.808 --> 01:29:14.874]  Medical Corps' potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:29:15.795 --> 01:29:22.301]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:29:22.482 --> 01:29:27.587]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:29:27.687 --> 01:29:36.536]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:29:36.596 --> 01:29:36.776]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:29:54.352 --> 01:29:54.892]  We're good to go.
[01:29:54.912 --> 01:29:55.332]  We're good to go.
[01:30:14.299 --> 01:30:18.182]  The Compost Twin is the only composter with two 10-bushel bins on one machine.
[01:30:18.402 --> 01:30:22.804]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.
[01:30:23.024 --> 01:30:26.867]  Plus, mixing the compost is a breeze with the Compost Twin's easy-turn gear system.
[01:30:27.107 --> 01:30:33.291]  And with a second chamber, you can continually add kitchen scraps and garden waste without disturbing the composting process in the first chamber.
[01:30:33.491 --> 01:30:36.312]  No more mess, no more odors, no more hard work.

[01:30:54.604 --> 01:30:55.745]  All water isn't the same.
[01:30:56.025 --> 01:31:01.029]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[01:31:01.269 --> 01:31:03.871]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[01:31:04.071 --> 01:31:12.617]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.
[01:31:12.997 --> 01:31:21.424]  Aquanorthwest.com carries a full line of products that will increase the water's energy by creating a positive spin and revitalizing water in a high vibration state.

[01:31:56.940 --> 01:31:57.440]  Don't worry.
[01:31:57.921 --> 01:31:59.501]  This show is documented.
[01:31:59.941 --> 01:32:02.703]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:03.123 --> 01:32:06.665]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:32:07.065 --> 01:32:11.227]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[01:32:11.687 --> 01:32:14.368]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[01:32:14.588 --> 01:32:18.190]  We're talking to retired New York City detective Jim Rothstein.
[01:32:18.910 --> 01:32:23.112]  He was even on the Governor's Commission investigating this decades ago.
[01:32:24.373 --> 01:32:24.653]  Jim...
[01:32:26.556 --> 01:32:28.038]  And I want to bring Paul Watson in here.
[01:32:28.638 --> 01:32:39.290]  We have giant sections on PrisonPlanet.com of mainstream AP, BBC, AFP, where they dig up a bunch of dead bodies of small children.
[01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:46.899]  They find women starving to death in cages in a government-controlled castle in France.
[01:32:49.801 --> 01:32:55.566]  Just over and over again, satanic killings linked back to the royal families.
[01:32:55.866 --> 01:33:00.070]  They dig dead bodies up in the Netherlands on the royal property.
[01:33:00.090 --> 01:33:02.892]  I mean, it's just massive.
[01:33:03.933 --> 01:33:06.355]  Italy, it's going on everywhere.
[01:33:06.375 --> 01:33:09.358]  And you talked about the international connections.
[01:33:09.778 --> 01:33:12.841]  I mentioned earlier, DynCorp, the UN, they've all been caught.
[01:33:13.447 --> 01:33:14.668]  I mean, it's not even debatable.
[01:33:15.388 --> 01:33:24.652]  Just massive levels, snuff films, just the pit of hell, and it seems to really be growing across the planet.
[01:33:25.232 --> 01:33:26.513]  Do you have any comments on that, Jim?
[01:33:27.113 --> 01:33:34.156]  Yes, they have been going on, and it's escalating, but you never see, as I said before, a complete investigation.
[01:33:34.196 --> 01:33:39.118]  They'll go to a point, and then everything stops, and that's where our problem is coming in.
[01:33:39.844 --> 01:33:45.849]  They have to do an investigation where they go right to the top, take it down, and prosecute these people.
[01:33:45.869 --> 01:33:47.791]  This would not be difficult to do.
[01:33:48.431 --> 01:33:49.792]  It would not be expensive.
[01:33:51.013 --> 01:33:57.579]  Compared to the amount of money we are paying now as a result of this, it would be pennies compared to that.
[01:33:58.419 --> 01:33:59.380]  And it can be done.
[01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:02.943]  We proved that back in the 70s when we ended the prostitution ring.
[01:34:03.303 --> 01:34:04.024]  It can be done.
[01:34:06.357 --> 01:34:09.580]  Paul Watson, this is rampant in England, is it not?
[01:34:10.941 --> 01:34:19.288]  Yeah, I mean, we hear the same cases, which point to top-level MPs being involved in the same thing.
[01:34:20.564 --> 01:34:26.469]  The thing I mentioned earlier, I've got the article here, Study Finds Disproportionate Abuse by Gays.
[01:34:26.989 --> 01:34:34.656]  A six-year study of sexual abuse committed by foster parents in Illinois found a highly disproportionate percentage of the cases were homosexual in nature.
[01:34:35.176 --> 01:34:42.823]  About one-third were same-sex, while estimates are that no more than 3% of people in the general population say they engage in homosexual acts.
[01:34:43.303 --> 01:34:54.672]  And then on the back of that, you get groups like Nambla tagging itself onto the gay rights movement, saying that consensual sex with children should be legalized in the same brain.
[01:34:54.712 --> 01:35:05.820]  Well, we had the American Psychological Association, founded by Dr. Ewing Cameron, who was convicted for running a giant CIA child kidnapping ring where they would brainwash children.
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:07.641]  Folks, that's like on the History Channel now.
[01:35:07.981 --> 01:35:08.782]  This is admitted...
[01:35:09.683 --> 01:35:10.704]  None of this is debatable.
[01:35:10.804 --> 01:35:12.185]  We only talk about the facts here.
[01:35:12.585 --> 01:35:13.326]  This is true.
[01:35:13.686 --> 01:35:25.477]  The American Psychological Association in 2000, and remember Dr. Laura got in trouble for saying it was wrong, put out their yearly report and said, pedophilia doesn't exist, and by the way, it's good for children.
[01:35:26.514 --> 01:35:27.735]  It's good for children.
[01:35:27.755 --> 01:35:29.797]  I mean, folks, this is big.
[01:35:30.077 --> 01:35:31.858]  This is at the highest levels.
[01:35:32.199 --> 01:35:35.301]  They're now coming out with what they want to do.
[01:35:35.321 --> 01:35:35.662]  Paul?
[01:35:36.222 --> 01:35:50.373]  Yeah, I mean, then we've had articles, I believe, out of Oregon, as you mentioned earlier, and other places where the people appointed into positions in social services have past convictions of pedophilia and child abuse.
[01:35:50.413 --> 01:35:54.957]  And these are the people allocating these adopted kids to homosexual parents.
[01:35:55.598 --> 01:36:02.164]  And it was something like 30,000 across the country had evidence of being involved in this.
[01:36:02.244 --> 01:36:04.626]  In the past were appointed to social services.
[01:36:04.646 --> 01:36:07.608]  So how can that not be a directed program?
[01:36:07.908 --> 01:36:08.989]  It's despicable.
[01:36:09.290 --> 01:36:10.230]  Well, it's like Florida.
[01:36:10.250 --> 01:36:13.713]  Remember the big controversy two years ago, over 3,000 children missing?
[01:36:14.094 --> 01:36:19.638]  Some were just off the list, but hundreds were being found dead or in prostitution or their heads chopped off.
[01:36:19.938 --> 01:36:21.560]  I'm talking about five-year-olds, folks.
[01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:30.087]  And it turned out the person running the entire database was a convicted top pedophile and the number two under them was too.
[01:36:30.408 --> 01:36:32.249]  That's, see folks, how they operate?
[01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:34.251]  Let me get a comment from the detective.
[01:36:34.271 --> 01:36:34.952]  Mr. Rothstein?
[01:36:35.212 --> 01:36:37.234]  Yes, and this is very true.
[01:36:37.294 --> 01:36:39.456]  We have let political correctness
[01:36:40.143 --> 01:36:41.443]  Start affecting everything.
[01:36:41.563 --> 01:36:48.365]  And political correctness just costs a bunch of people their lives down in Atlanta, Georgia, as you can see, which is different than this.
[01:36:48.445 --> 01:37:05.449]  But the same thing is happening when he gets into this, where they let these people who are, first of all, pedophiles to start with, and put them in positions to run organizations and that, and they don't check on it because, number one, it's protected from the top.
[01:37:07.868 --> 01:37:08.689]  Unbelievable.
[01:37:09.069 --> 01:37:12.031]  It's just totally out of control.
[01:37:12.051 --> 01:37:22.637]  I want to take some calls from Bob and Travis and others here in just a few minutes for folks that have been holding patiently, but Jim, how do we stop this?
[01:37:23.237 --> 01:37:25.299]  Or do you just see it getting worse and worse?
[01:37:25.539 --> 01:37:27.980]  No, as I said before, it takes the people.
[01:37:28.340 --> 01:37:35.685]  Right now, if somebody truly wanted to stop this, any law enforcement agency in this country...
[01:37:36.249 --> 01:37:38.552]  That would be willing to take this on could do it.
[01:37:39.352 --> 01:37:47.241]  But they would have to protect the officers and the prosecutors who are working on it because the first thing that happens, they go after them.
[01:37:47.984 --> 01:37:51.566]  They try to buy you, they threaten you, they do whatever they can to stop you.
[01:37:52.007 --> 01:38:06.455]  And a lot of this, and by the way, I've had former government officials on whose job was hunting these people down overseas, and really they were operating, they later discovered, to go after the competition of the government-controlled rings.
[01:38:06.795 --> 01:38:14.140]  Kind of like illegal drugs in this country, the government agents are just allowed to go after the competition, not after the main mafia's.
[01:38:15.001 --> 01:38:21.083]  And it is just systemic across the board to have this going on.
[01:38:21.103 --> 01:38:30.526]  Well, Alex, there's another very important issue here, and that is the extortion, the human compromise, the human stuff that goes with it.
[01:38:31.026 --> 01:38:37.148]  If you can compromise somebody as a pedophile, you have anything you want.
[01:38:37.228 --> 01:38:41.729]  Say, for instance, you had a politician and you were in a business that needed his support.
[01:38:42.202 --> 01:38:45.607]  You set him up with a kid, take the pictures, and you extort him.
[01:38:46.087 --> 01:38:48.270]  And that's what's happening in many of these cases.
[01:38:48.290 --> 01:38:52.596]  A lot of the cases I investigated ended up with big-time extortion.
[01:38:53.057 --> 01:38:55.580]  And it was used years ago to fight communism.
[01:38:55.821 --> 01:38:58.705]  That was a big toll that was taken.
[01:39:04.452 --> 01:39:12.015]  Well, the globalists are masters at using these excuses to get people in their system, government agents, to go along with all this evil.
[01:39:12.215 --> 01:39:15.977]  Now, also, a lot of this results in the torture and death of these children.
[01:39:15.997 --> 01:39:23.521]  You know, the American Psychological Association may say it's as wholesome as apple pie, but it's as rotten as a cesspit, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:24.001 --> 01:39:26.282]  But a lot of these children end up getting killed, don't they?
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.141]  Yes, a lot of them end up, they just disappear.
[01:39:29.161 --> 01:39:30.061]  You'll never find them.
[01:39:31.702 --> 01:39:45.947]  Like I said during the 70s, at one point we had an intelligence system set up where we could locate almost every kid that fell into this network and naturally it never went anywhere because it was getting too powerful.
[01:39:46.367 --> 01:39:48.408]  We were able to penetrate almost anything.
[01:39:48.448 --> 01:39:50.329]  We had infiltrated the whole underground.
[01:39:51.883 --> 01:39:57.666]  You say you learned of Frank, Barney Frank, decades before it popped up on the national news.
[01:39:58.207 --> 01:40:00.288]  Where did Frank first come up, the congressman?
[01:40:00.368 --> 01:40:07.532]  Well, it came up in the general investigations we were doing with other politicians that came out of the White House at the time.
[01:40:07.572 --> 01:40:12.755]  And then when the thing with the kids happened, where they were roaming around the White House, that was no news.
[01:40:13.875 --> 01:40:16.657]  There were a lot of people that knew that that had been going on.
[01:40:17.210 --> 01:40:19.072]  And if you noticed, it got covered up.
[01:40:19.252 --> 01:40:20.334]  It never went anywhere.
[01:40:20.434 --> 01:40:21.975]  Nobody ever investigated it.
[01:40:22.095 --> 01:40:26.721]  It showed up in the front pages of the Washington Times and a few other publications, but yeah, then nothing happened.
[01:40:26.961 --> 01:40:36.111]  Nothing was ever done to investigate that, and we know full well that that tied directly back to what John DeCamp was doing in the Franklin cover-up investigation.
[01:40:36.824 --> 01:40:38.465]  And that's now coming out.
[01:40:38.565 --> 01:40:39.426]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:40:39.506 --> 01:40:41.087]  Barney Frank said he made a mistake.
[01:40:41.167 --> 01:40:42.008]  He was sorry.
[01:40:42.288 --> 01:40:42.508]  Yeah.
[01:40:42.689 --> 01:40:46.872]  He's sorry he was running a pedophile ring out of his... Folks, this is admitted.
[01:40:46.892 --> 01:40:48.593]  You can go to the microfiche, the library.
[01:40:48.893 --> 01:40:50.555]  How did he not go to jail?
[01:40:50.735 --> 01:40:52.156]  That's the big question.
[01:40:52.296 --> 01:40:55.578]  And that's where the whole problem starts, when they allow this to happen.
[01:40:56.099 --> 01:40:58.120]  And when you know crimes have been committed.
[01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:00.242]  For instance, the same thing happened with the church.
[01:41:00.882 --> 01:41:05.426]  And nobody can pick on me because I am a Catholic, and so they can't holler at me for picking on them.
[01:41:05.874 --> 01:41:09.498]  How can you violate that many children and nobody gets prosecuted?
[01:41:09.518 --> 01:41:12.522]  And there's something wrong.
[01:41:13.903 --> 01:41:15.225]  Well, it's just unbelievable.
[01:41:15.305 --> 01:41:18.148]  And you know, folks, it's just like the New World Order and 9-11.
[01:41:18.348 --> 01:41:22.453]  I don't want to believe it, but when the facts are there, I mean, Frank admits it.
[01:41:23.087 --> 01:41:30.289]  I remember watching on the news, you know, underage callboy rang out of his house, and, oh, I didn't know.
[01:41:30.309 --> 01:41:32.489]  I would just let these people use my house.
[01:41:32.929 --> 01:41:33.730]  But he lived there.
[01:41:34.210 --> 01:41:35.470]  And you just look at him on TV.
[01:41:35.510 --> 01:41:37.150]  I mean, he's a sack of pus.
[01:41:37.871 --> 01:41:41.131]  He is just a disgusting piece of garbage.
[01:41:41.151 --> 01:41:42.292]  You can just look at him.
[01:41:45.192 --> 01:41:46.293]  Well, he's not the only one.
[01:41:46.333 --> 01:41:47.413]  There are many, many more.
[01:41:47.993 --> 01:41:51.234]  And that's why these investigations have a hard time going anywhere.
[01:41:51.835 --> 01:41:55.918]  And like I said, there was stuff where they used as compromise.
[01:41:56.058 --> 01:41:57.760]  It's a fine art.
[01:41:57.780 --> 01:41:58.640]  They've perfected.
[01:41:58.861 --> 01:42:02.703]  And we uncovered that from the early 70s on.
[01:42:02.884 --> 01:42:07.667]  And that was one of our biggest problems that stopped us from going ahead.
[01:42:07.687 --> 01:42:12.311]  And that's why when the governor appointed us, we thought we might have a chance to get something done.
[01:42:12.391 --> 01:42:14.893]  And as every other time, it got stopped.
[01:42:17.014 --> 01:42:19.296]  And that's why we need the people to get involved.
[01:42:19.416 --> 01:42:21.418]  We need shows like yours, more shows.
[01:42:22.119 --> 01:42:27.121]  You know, and just keep hammering this thing and calling these politicians up and asking them on the air.
[01:42:27.641 --> 01:42:28.561]  What are you going to do about it?
[01:42:28.761 --> 01:42:33.223]  Well, Jim, Detective Rothstein, something else that came up was the finders.
[01:42:33.363 --> 01:42:35.584]  I mean, that was not debatable.
[01:42:35.604 --> 01:42:41.826]  It started out in Florida with a vanload of little boys, and then it led back to this government operation.
[01:42:41.846 --> 01:42:42.526]  Tell us about that.
[01:42:42.566 --> 01:42:44.727]  Yes, that was an intelligence operation.
[01:42:44.807 --> 01:42:47.028]  In fact, I was in Washington when that broke.
[01:42:48.643 --> 01:42:57.808]  Where at that time, this was in the early 90s, when that first started breaking, and there was a very good man by the name of Tom Straminski who was responsible for this.
[01:42:58.348 --> 01:43:08.053]  And at that point, there was going to be a bipartisan congressional investigation into all of that, and I even had to prepare a document outlining what it was.
[01:43:08.593 --> 01:43:12.215]  And before it could get going, it was shut down tighter than a drum.
[01:43:12.916 --> 01:43:14.797]  So it goes across party lines...
[01:43:15.589 --> 01:43:16.669]  And it covers everything.
[01:43:17.330 --> 01:43:22.051]  That investigation would have been able to go to the top, but it got shut down.
[01:43:22.071 --> 01:43:25.753]  So it's not just at the state level.
[01:43:27.413 --> 01:43:32.275]  Well, you obviously have criminology, and I've just researched a lot of my own.
[01:43:32.815 --> 01:43:37.937]  The mindset of serial killers and abusers and sickos and sadists,
[01:43:38.607 --> 01:43:54.376]  They get in their own little groups, their own little societies, they correspond, and really we look at the New World Order, we look at Rome, we look at the Aztecs, we look at throughout history, elites go crazy, they get decadent, they get inbred, and they start doing this in every case in history.
[01:43:54.436 --> 01:43:55.036]  This is what?
[01:43:56.184 --> 01:44:02.387]  This elite does, and we've got the same group in, and they're a bunch of people who don't have conscience, who are psychopaths.
[01:44:02.807 --> 01:44:08.771]  Is it any surprise that they're setting up their own kingdom of darkness right here in front of us?
[01:44:09.331 --> 01:44:13.373]  And now, Jim, I mentioned all these TV shows where they show torturing children is good.
[01:44:15.314 --> 01:44:17.775]  Do you see that as part of the master plan to condition us?
[01:44:18.095 --> 01:44:18.556]  Well, yes.
[01:44:18.616 --> 01:44:22.858]  Like I said, when we did that investigation with the New York State Select Committee on Crime that time,
[01:44:23.399 --> 01:44:34.761]  We had the Policy Science Corporation as consultants, which was headed by Harold Laswell, who explained to us that this is exactly what happened in the history of the world and is happening again now.
[01:44:35.441 --> 01:44:42.782]  Probably one of the greatest cover-ups that ever took place in this country that involved all elements of this was the Son of Sam case.
[01:44:43.402 --> 01:44:45.883]  I don't know if you're familiar with that, with David Berkowitz.
[01:44:46.143 --> 01:44:48.823]  Yeah, definite operation, yeah.
[01:44:49.123 --> 01:44:52.124]  Yes, and as you know, Maury Terry wrote a book on it,
[01:44:52.731 --> 01:44:58.456]  Which covered the whole thing, and to this day, nobody has ever investigated fully.
[01:44:58.496 --> 01:45:06.743]  I've been brought back to New York twice to look at this case, and both times when I get there, something happens and it's shut back down again.
[01:45:07.224 --> 01:45:09.346]  So we know it's still going on to this day.
[01:45:09.406 --> 01:45:11.067]  It's just spread out all over the country.
[01:45:13.069 --> 01:45:14.250]  And they're getting more power.
[01:45:14.690 --> 01:45:16.672]  Yes, and that's why we need the people.
[01:45:17.153 --> 01:45:18.634]  Only the people can stop this.
[01:45:19.241 --> 01:45:25.994]  If we had thousands of people calling their congressmen and saying and demanding, we want something done now.
[01:45:26.394 --> 01:45:31.524]  And when they do the investigation, don't hire the people who've been covering it up to do the investigating.
[01:45:31.912 --> 01:45:35.593]  Bring some people in that truly know what's happening in this field.
[01:45:35.613 --> 01:45:36.513]  Well, it expands.
[01:45:36.613 --> 01:45:47.015]  I've got mainstream news articles about Janet Reno caught in the back of a car with an underage girl with a vomit all over because Reno was on so many pills and booze.
[01:45:47.615 --> 01:45:50.116]  And then Reno's tastes are well known.
[01:45:50.956 --> 01:45:53.097]  And it just expands out from there.
[01:45:53.377 --> 01:45:55.417]  These people get caught all the time.
[01:45:56.077 --> 01:45:56.477]  Oh, yes.
[01:45:56.577 --> 01:45:58.218]  Every day there's somebody nailed.
[01:45:58.358 --> 01:45:58.958]  And every day...
[01:45:59.437 --> 01:46:03.881]  And remember, when something's fixed, that means they owe somebody a favor again.
[01:46:03.901 --> 01:46:06.623]  And then it's just self-perpetuating.
[01:46:06.683 --> 01:46:08.024]  It just keeps going on and on.
[01:46:09.005 --> 01:46:12.728]  And again, that's why we have to do something and do it soon.
[01:46:14.110 --> 01:46:15.951]  It's just getting worse and worse every year.
[01:46:15.971 --> 01:46:19.874]  I mean, Janet Reno, the 13-year-old girl, covered in vomit.
[01:46:20.095 --> 01:46:21.736]  I mean, that's who we're dealing with, folks.
[01:46:22.136 --> 01:46:23.517]  Vomit-covered vermin.
[01:46:24.899 --> 01:46:25.139]  Okay.
[01:46:26.368 --> 01:46:27.273]  Disgusting, isn't it?
[01:46:27.293 --> 01:46:28.096]  I'm so sick of these.
[01:46:28.498 --> 01:46:29.463]  Man, I'm telling you.
[01:46:29.965 --> 01:46:31.050]  Paul Watson comments.
[01:46:32.210 --> 01:46:35.731]  Well, I mean, we can make no other conclusion than what we're facing is pure evil.
[01:46:36.131 --> 01:46:37.912]  And they push it through the culture as well.
[01:46:38.312 --> 01:46:42.054]  I mean, seven-year-old girls dressing as whores is seen as cool.
[01:46:42.794 --> 01:46:43.954]  They throw it in our faces.
[01:46:44.014 --> 01:46:52.657]  I mean, articles in Newsweek about how 11-year-old girls giving oral sex is seen as cool now from the peer pressure.
[01:46:53.038 --> 01:46:56.719]  And here in Britain, we have sex education classes at age seven.
[01:46:57.239 --> 01:47:14.530]  They're pushing it through the culture, through the schooling system, and it's despicable, and it's designed to warp people's mentalities into accepting this, to the point where, via political correctness, you know, in 20 years, will pedophilia be on the same level of acceptability as homosexuality?
[01:47:14.890 --> 01:47:21.995]  It's getting that bad that we see... Well, I predict in 20 years, people will be marrying their cockroaches.
[01:47:22.874 --> 01:47:23.354]  Exactly.
[01:47:23.454 --> 01:47:24.295]  No, I'm serious.
[01:47:25.015 --> 01:47:29.657]  People will walk and they'll dress the cockroach up in a little groom's outfit.
[01:47:30.077 --> 01:47:31.618]  I'm not kidding.
[01:47:31.658 --> 01:47:31.918]  Jim?
[01:47:32.498 --> 01:47:32.939]  I agree.
[01:47:33.499 --> 01:47:34.739]  It's getting unbelievable.
[01:47:34.940 --> 01:47:37.201]  All in political correctness.
[01:47:38.181 --> 01:47:40.402]  We can't arm this where we can't pick on them.
[01:47:40.982 --> 01:47:51.347]  Are we going to let our children for the next two generations go down the drain just because somebody who is totally decadent wants to get into society and put their
[01:47:52.154 --> 01:47:52.955]  Hello, Alex.
[01:47:52.995 --> 01:47:53.155]  Hello.
[01:47:53.195 --> 01:47:53.415]  Hi, Jim.
[01:47:53.435 --> 01:47:53.495]  Yes.
[01:48:21.428 --> 01:48:24.190]  First of all, my hat's off to both of you for all you're doing.
[01:48:24.370 --> 01:48:25.370]  Speak up for me.
[01:48:25.450 --> 01:48:26.611]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:48:26.631 --> 01:48:28.052]  Can you hear me now?
[01:48:28.092 --> 01:48:28.612]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:48:28.952 --> 01:48:29.292]  Okay.
[01:48:30.133 --> 01:48:32.374]  My hat's off to both of you.
[01:48:33.155 --> 01:48:35.436]  We need more people like both of you.
[01:48:36.737 --> 01:48:43.461]  I have something that... Basically, here, I live in a small town in Pennsylvania, Crawford County.
[01:48:43.921 --> 01:48:46.862]  And we have a... We had a judge that was here.
[01:48:49.024 --> 01:48:50.805]  Basically, he got caught with a...
[01:48:52.262 --> 01:48:56.345]  Pulling into a Holiday Inn one night with an underage girl.
[01:48:57.626 --> 01:49:04.592]  State police pulled over and the next day the state policeman didn't even have a job.
[01:49:05.452 --> 01:49:06.893]  This came from me.
[01:49:07.274 --> 01:49:10.276]  I worked as a steel worker and worked with a state constable there.
[01:49:11.297 --> 01:49:12.057]  He told me this.
[01:49:12.658 --> 01:49:17.461]  He said, if you ever say this, I will deny I told you this.
[01:49:17.702 --> 01:49:19.743]  Basically, the judge isn't with us anymore.
[01:49:19.823 --> 01:49:20.484]  He was...
[01:49:21.579 --> 01:49:27.284]  Eventually taken into so much stuff that he was told to stand down.
[01:49:28.605 --> 01:49:32.728]  And now he's, you know, then he just died.
[01:49:35.650 --> 01:49:37.712]  But that's basically what I have to say.
[01:49:37.732 --> 01:49:39.633]  We have to stop these perverts, you know.
[01:49:40.774 --> 01:49:42.315]  Well, they're more than just perverts.
[01:49:42.696 --> 01:49:43.196]  Oh, I understand.
[01:49:43.256 --> 01:49:46.999]  They're demon-possessed soul eaters.
[01:49:47.479 --> 01:49:48.740]  And I had a couple questions.
[01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:49.341]  Stay there.
[01:49:49.421 --> 01:49:50.702]  We'll let you comment when we get back.
[01:49:54.071 --> 01:49:58.413]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.

[01:50:03.175 --> 01:50:07.516]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:07.576 --> 01:50:08.917]  The New World Order.
[01:50:10.719 --> 01:50:14.943]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.

[01:53:23.230 --> 01:53:26.672]  And we just get into the mainstream news articles for about five minutes in there about the
[01:53:27.532 --> 01:53:35.734]  Gay porn stars and all that being shipped into the Bohemian Grove, mainstream news articles, and Arnold and his porno spreads and all the rest of it.
[01:53:35.754 --> 01:53:36.974]  I mean, this runs through everything.
[01:53:36.994 --> 01:53:38.834]  That's just the crust of this.
[01:53:38.854 --> 01:53:39.554]  That's the top.
[01:53:40.155 --> 01:53:45.476]  It just goes into a bottomless pit, ladies and gentlemen, into the most horrible things we can't even imagine.
[01:53:46.456 --> 01:53:50.937]  You need to get martial law 911 rise of the police state.

[01:54:23.530 --> 01:54:23.870]  Okay.
[01:54:24.531 --> 01:54:37.257]  Basically, one thing I wanted to say is I've been trying to call my congressman, Phil English, and anymore he doesn't respond to me telling me anything of what I want to ask him of, you know, different things that he's voted on.
[01:54:37.337 --> 01:54:39.559]  I hear nothing from them, and they won't give me any answers.
[01:54:40.599 --> 01:54:45.742]  And also, one thing I wanted to ask you is, this will be real quick.
[01:54:45.782 --> 01:54:46.702]  It has nothing to do with this.
[01:54:46.742 --> 01:54:47.303]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:54:47.423 --> 01:54:47.803]  What day...
[01:54:48.519 --> 01:54:52.342]  Was Building 7 pulled, and how long after the second building did it fall?
[01:54:52.442 --> 01:54:59.247]  It was like 5.30, 4.30 Central, and they blew it up.
[01:54:59.347 --> 01:54:59.888]  Thanks for the call.
[01:54:59.908 --> 01:55:00.508]  On the same day?
[01:55:00.889 --> 01:55:01.309]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:01.349 --> 01:55:01.669]  Same day.
[01:55:02.250 --> 01:55:02.890]  Thanks for the call.
[01:55:03.591 --> 01:55:04.792]  Travis in Washington.
[01:55:04.832 --> 01:55:06.173]  Travis, you're on the air.
[01:55:06.233 --> 01:55:06.653]  Go ahead.
[01:55:07.073 --> 01:55:07.354]  Hey, man.
[01:55:07.714 --> 01:55:09.195]  Hello.
[01:55:09.735 --> 01:55:10.756]  Just a couple comments, Alex.
[01:55:10.796 --> 01:55:11.957]  I like your 9-11 film.
[01:55:11.977 --> 01:55:15.820]  I didn't get a review of it because I didn't see the link, and that goes to your webmaster there.
[01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:18.262]  I didn't see it off my Prison Planet TV website.
[01:55:18.860 --> 01:55:19.260]  No biggie.
[01:55:19.901 --> 01:55:20.341]  Good film.
[01:55:20.661 --> 01:55:22.683]  The communist guy was the best.
[01:55:23.043 --> 01:55:28.587]  He was so busy talking, he ignored anything you had to say, so I'd like to dub that guy as ignorant.
[01:55:29.528 --> 01:55:30.789]  I do have a question for Jim, though.
[01:55:30.849 --> 01:55:31.309]  He's still there.
[01:55:31.329 --> 01:55:31.829]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:55:32.330 --> 01:55:39.595]  Hey, Jim, did they teach you in detective school that, according to our Constitution, unless you come against somebody's life, liberty, or property, you haven't committed a crime?
[01:55:41.557 --> 01:55:43.278]  What was the... I didn't get the...
[01:55:44.147 --> 01:55:50.732]  Did they teach us that it wasn't a crime unless you did something against... Unless you come against somebody's life, liberty, or property.
[01:55:51.573 --> 01:55:52.454]  No, no.
[01:55:52.694 --> 01:55:53.454]  They didn't teach you that?
[01:55:54.055 --> 01:55:54.755]  No, no.
[01:55:55.036 --> 01:55:55.516]  I wonder why.
[01:55:55.536 --> 01:55:56.497]  I don't know.
[01:55:56.917 --> 01:55:57.237]  I don't know.
[01:55:57.257 --> 01:55:57.658]  Pretty odd.
[01:55:58.759 --> 01:56:01.561]  Anyway, your Read for Madness film, Alex, I liked it.
[01:56:01.821 --> 01:56:02.922]  I liked it a lot.
[01:56:03.502 --> 01:56:06.865]  All the herbs were put in here by God to use for us for medicinal purposes.
[01:56:07.986 --> 01:56:11.589]  Any drug, I figure, is extracted from a plant and then played with by man.
[01:56:12.523 --> 01:56:13.504]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:56:13.544 --> 01:56:13.644]  Hello.
[01:56:13.664 --> 01:56:14.224]  Jim, how are you?
[01:56:14.244 --> 01:56:14.885]  Good, how are you?
[01:56:14.905 --> 01:56:16.947]  Hello, Paul, if you're still there.
[01:56:16.987 --> 01:56:17.127]  Yep.
[01:56:42.621 --> 01:56:48.884]  I wonder if James Traficant from Youngstown who was thrown in jail has come up on your radio on any of this.
[01:56:48.944 --> 01:57:01.989]  He came out before he was slapped with the charges he was slapped with and was talking about this place, some type of charm school in Youngstown where they were actually doing this type of activities.
[01:57:03.449 --> 01:57:08.111]  Well I don't remember Traficant in particular but I had during my investigations
[01:57:08.712 --> 01:57:12.214]  A lot of my stuff led me to Ohio, especially Columbus, Ohio.
[01:57:12.814 --> 01:57:17.696]  And that was well known at that time that there were all types of things taking place in the state of Ohio.
[01:57:18.816 --> 01:57:19.857]  And it's interesting, too.
[01:57:20.137 --> 01:57:29.781]  It's like, you know, you tell us to call these congressmen and senators, and a lot of those senators that we're going to be calling have pictures of them probably on file that they don't want to get out.
[01:57:29.821 --> 01:57:36.344]  And I believe that this is why things never change, and they can't complete the agenda that they've started.
[01:57:36.656 --> 01:57:38.137]  That's why we have to vote them out.
[01:57:38.217 --> 01:57:41.559]  Find out who they are and vote them out and get somebody decent into them.
[01:57:41.599 --> 01:57:42.419]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:49.964 --> 01:57:50.624]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.284 --> 01:57:52.405]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.045 --> 01:57:54.146]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.806 --> 01:57:55.627]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.387 --> 01:57:57.148]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.916 --> 01:58:01.598]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.098 --> 01:58:06.221]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.561 --> 01:58:09.863]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:58:09.883 --> 01:58:10.683]  until 2 p.m.
[01:58:10.703 --> 01:58:11.764]  Central Standard Time.
[01:58:11.784 --> 01:58:14.085]  We're here live back from 9 to midnight Central.
[01:58:15.246 --> 01:58:18.547]  Got Paul Watson doing a great job writing a shotgun with us today.
[01:58:19.088 --> 01:58:23.550]  Webmaster for two of my great websites, prisonplanet.tv and prisonplanet.com.
[01:58:23.570 --> 01:58:24.851]  We're talking to retired New York...
[01:58:25.569 --> 01:58:37.899]  Detective Jim Rothstein, who was part of the governor's task force investigating, well, underage prostitution, pedophilia, you name it, time and time again it led back to government officials.
[01:58:39.560 --> 01:58:43.223]  And he was told to basically get off the case many, many times.
[01:58:43.963 --> 01:58:45.845]  Somebody's got to stand up for these little ones.
[01:58:46.365 --> 01:58:48.667]  Somebody's got to talk about these horrors.
[01:58:49.327 --> 01:58:53.811]  And as a society, this is our government that wants us to give up all of our freedoms to them.
[01:58:54.457 --> 01:58:57.279]  This is the government selling us that torture and evil is good.
[01:58:57.979 --> 01:58:58.880]  It's just disgusting.
[01:58:58.900 --> 01:59:01.001]  I know we have a lot of callers holding.
[01:59:01.461 --> 01:59:05.224]  We'll have Jim for two more segments, then I'm going to shift gears into other news with Paul Watson.
[01:59:05.564 --> 01:59:10.227]  Toll-free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:59:11.227 --> 01:59:20.113]  But before we go back to calls, Paul Watson just sitting back listening to all of this, what are your ideas on ways to stop it?
[01:59:21.508 --> 01:59:28.879]  Well I mean firstly we need to get the government, get the schools out of sex education because it should be down to the parents.
[01:59:29.532 --> 01:59:32.113]  I talked about this earlier, and it needs to be emphasized.
[01:59:33.053 --> 01:59:35.754]  Just look what message the government is sending out.
[01:59:36.274 --> 01:59:40.655]  I said seven-year-olds were being forced to undergo sex education.
[01:59:41.376 --> 01:59:43.176]  I've actually got an article here from The Guardian.
[01:59:43.596 --> 01:59:48.778]  Sex lessons for five-year-olds should be compulsory, say government advisors.
[01:59:49.258 --> 01:59:50.919]  That is even worse than I thought.
[01:59:51.279 --> 01:59:58.861]  And then Nickelodeon puts together a little corporate meeting and says, this was like two years ago, oh, we need to sexualize the eight to eleven-year-olds.
[01:59:59.865 --> 02:00:22.272]  Yeah, and then you get their so-called cultural icons, Christina Aguilera, saying that it's unfair for a girl who sleeps with several different boys to be called a slut, if a boy does it, and gets called a stud.
[02:00:23.061 --> 02:00:39.780]  I mean, it's good for girls to sleep with several different boys, and the people that listen to her are, you know, 11, 12, 13-year-olds who read these magazines that they put out like Sugar and Just 17 here in the UK, which are completely full of trying to sexualize children.
[02:00:39.820 --> 02:00:43.364]  And those magazines like 17 are targeting 10-year-olds?
[02:00:44.119 --> 02:00:50.567]  Oh yeah, they call them Just 17 and their main base of readership is the 10-11 year olds and they know exactly what they're doing.
[02:00:50.888 --> 02:00:54.713]  Who was the big rock star who got mad about it and went public?
[02:00:54.793 --> 02:00:55.454]  Bob Geldof.
[02:00:56.081 --> 02:00:57.722]  Yeah, because he saw his daughter's magazine.
[02:00:57.742 --> 02:00:58.963]  He's like, this is pornographic.
[02:00:59.403 --> 02:01:00.964]  Now, let's go back to the detective.
[02:01:01.324 --> 02:01:05.766]  Jim, I mean, we really see the American Psychological Association saying pedophilia is good.
[02:01:05.806 --> 02:01:08.067]  We see this big promotion everywhere.
[02:01:08.267 --> 02:01:09.688]  They're really trying to come out in the open.
[02:01:10.048 --> 02:01:10.709]  Why, certainly.
[02:01:10.809 --> 02:01:18.013]  And it's all part of the social engineering that they're trying to do around this world and country.
[02:01:18.193 --> 02:01:21.014]  And that's one of the first things that has to be stopped.
[02:01:21.494 --> 02:01:24.476]  They seem to think we don't know what's good for our own children.
[02:01:25.094 --> 02:01:30.459]  And many times the garbage they put out there is far worse than anything we can imagine.
[02:01:31.139 --> 02:01:40.247]  And the big thing here, though, is to really get out of this, is to start some investigations and put some of these people in prison for 50, 60 years.
[02:01:40.788 --> 02:01:42.609]  It would be amazed how quick they're cured.
[02:01:44.671 --> 02:01:45.391]  Absolutely.
[02:01:45.412 --> 02:01:50.716]  All right, we're going to break here in a moment and come back and take some more calls.
[02:01:50.736 --> 02:01:52.818]  We're going to talk to Vox and Rodney and
[02:01:53.453 --> 02:01:55.756]  David and many others, toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[02:01:55.856 --> 02:02:06.810]  I'm going to give each caller about a minute and a half or so, and let both our guests comment on it, because I want to get to as many people as possible in this next final segment with our guest.
[02:02:06.850 --> 02:02:09.854]  And then, Paul, what's some of the other news you want to cover later?
[02:02:11.475 --> 02:02:16.618]  We need to cover rock stars getting arrested in airports for the kind of t-shirt they're wearing.
[02:02:17.098 --> 02:02:19.820]  A new level of homeland security.
[02:02:20.500 --> 02:02:25.283]  More evidence on the Princess Diana situation, which we need to go over as well.
[02:02:26.224 --> 02:02:26.984]  Clear murder.
[02:02:27.044 --> 02:02:30.026]  I mean, she said, Charles was going to kill me in a fake auto accident.
[02:02:30.066 --> 02:02:30.947]  He told me so.
[02:02:30.967 --> 02:02:33.128]  Then she dies.
[02:02:33.248 --> 02:02:34.229]  I mean, it's pretty obvious.
[02:02:34.669 --> 02:02:36.090]  But there have been some new developments.
[02:02:36.130 --> 02:02:37.451]  We'll talk about that as well.
[02:02:38.268 --> 02:02:42.131]  Plus, the New York Times says the feds are telling them what the new terror targets are going to be.
[02:02:42.631 --> 02:02:44.552]  Look out shopping malls and schools.
[02:02:45.473 --> 02:02:46.974]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:47.194 --> 02:02:50.276]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:50.416 --> 02:02:54.299]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:54.359 --> 02:02:58.602]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State to the Takeover.
[02:02:58.942 --> 02:03:02.705]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:02.785 --> 02:03:04.646]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:05.226 --> 02:03:08.147]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[02:03:08.187 --> 02:03:12.889]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:13.049 --> 02:03:16.091]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[02:03:16.271 --> 02:03:19.132]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:03:19.632 --> 02:03:25.755]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:26.275 --> 02:03:28.117]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[02:03:44.833 --> 02:03:48.114]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:03:48.155 --> 02:03:52.376]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:03:52.596 --> 02:03:55.378]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:03:55.578 --> 02:03:57.979]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:03:58.159 --> 02:04:06.802]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:04:07.003 --> 02:04:08.343]  The Berkey light is different.
[02:04:08.543 --> 02:04:12.705]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path.
[02:04:13.045 --> 02:04:13.806]  We're good to go.
[02:04:42.725 --> 02:04:43.380]  We're good to go.
[02:04:44.421 --> 02:04:46.102]  Soon, the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[02:04:46.302 --> 02:04:48.323]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[02:04:48.503 --> 02:04:49.204]  Prepare yourself.
[02:04:49.364 --> 02:04:53.066]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.
[02:04:53.206 --> 02:04:58.949]  Call toll-free 888-211-1715 and receive the book The Bible Says for free.
[02:04:59.009 --> 02:05:00.390]  There is absolutely no obligation.
[02:05:00.550 --> 02:05:03.171]  No one will call you and your number will not be sold to telemarketers.
[02:05:03.311 --> 02:05:04.892]  We just want to make sure you know the truth.
[02:05:05.192 --> 02:05:07.974]  Get your free book, The Bible Says, by calling toll-free 888-211-1715.
[02:05:08.014 --> 02:05:08.754]  Again, that's 888-211-1715.
[02:05:14.421 --> 02:05:14.781]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:05:49.973 --> 02:05:50.613]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.274 --> 02:05:52.334]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.035 --> 02:05:54.156]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.816 --> 02:05:55.637]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.377 --> 02:05:57.298]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.958 --> 02:06:01.681]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.121 --> 02:06:06.224]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:09.329 --> 02:06:12.831]  Coming up, the White House defends its video news releases.
[02:06:12.951 --> 02:06:18.355]  Hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars of fake newscasts paying off your local news stations.
[02:06:18.875 --> 02:06:21.537]  You don't just think they get the money to air those fake newscasts.
[02:06:21.997 --> 02:06:30.983]  Oh no, then that money also buys them influence with the way they tailor their programming on top of running the propaganda pieces.
[02:06:32.047 --> 02:06:32.928]  Also, U.S.
[02:06:32.968 --> 02:06:37.890]  report lists possible terrorist attacks and likely targets and the toll.
[02:06:38.590 --> 02:06:39.291]  We'll be getting into that.
[02:06:39.311 --> 02:06:42.692]  Also, new information on Princess Diana's murder.
[02:06:43.273 --> 02:06:52.377]  Right now, we're talking to Jim Rothstein, a retired New York City police detective who worked for the governor on a commission tracking these government-run white slavery rings.
[02:06:53.720 --> 02:06:58.763]  He knew about Barney Frank and his callboy ring a full decade before it broke on national news.
[02:06:58.803 --> 02:07:00.904]  Remember, Barney Frank never got in trouble.
[02:07:00.924 --> 02:07:03.226]  We're talking about real, documented stuff here.
[02:07:04.587 --> 02:07:06.768]  And let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:07:07.368 --> 02:07:09.510]  Let's talk to Vox in New York.
[02:07:09.530 --> 02:07:12.832]  You're on the air with Jim Rothstein, Paul Watson, and Alex Jones.
[02:07:12.872 --> 02:07:13.212]  Go ahead.
[02:07:13.232 --> 02:07:13.672]  Come on in.
[02:07:14.253 --> 02:07:14.893]  Great show, guys.
[02:07:15.253 --> 02:07:16.954]  Thanks a lot.
[02:07:16.994 --> 02:07:19.396]  The Rosetta Stone seemed to drop from the sky on your show.
[02:07:20.751 --> 02:07:26.436]  Father Ritter, the detective mentioned Father Ritter, who I trace back as an honorary knight of Malta.
[02:07:27.156 --> 02:07:33.581]  And this is the exclusive sovereign order of Malta, which is the most elite of the elite.
[02:07:34.161 --> 02:07:36.443]  And so you say, you know, we have to investigate them.
[02:07:36.883 --> 02:07:40.866]  We have people like George Tennant and George Bush and Colin Powell who are also knights of Malta.
[02:07:41.307 --> 02:07:44.609]  There's very few people who can investigate these people.
[02:07:45.430 --> 02:07:46.811]  Now they're running Covenant House.
[02:07:47.458 --> 02:07:48.079]  We're good.
[02:08:09.611 --> 02:08:13.793]  Just very suspicious, pedophilic, historical, documented cases.
[02:08:14.073 --> 02:08:20.815]  And Bush apparently hid after the revelation of... I've got to stop you.
[02:08:20.855 --> 02:08:28.398]  Somebody's got an answering machine live on the air open, so whoever's got an answering machine going off in the background, please cover your phone up.
[02:08:29.579 --> 02:08:32.620]  Let me get a comment from Jim Rothstein on the things you're saying.
[02:08:33.020 --> 02:08:35.681]  Well, I know in particular about Father Ritter.
[02:08:35.961 --> 02:08:38.202]  Father Ritter was set up
[02:08:38.661 --> 02:08:38.821]  Okay.
[02:09:06.119 --> 02:09:09.701]  Also, some of the chilling proximities that Bush Sr.
[02:09:09.781 --> 02:09:10.962]  has had.
[02:09:11.102 --> 02:09:19.807]  Also, I'm getting tips that there was a thing called Boys for Sale, which was a documentary apparently aired on PBS in Texas and nowhere else.
[02:09:19.967 --> 02:09:27.891]  And it was Thomas Pilpot, P-H-I-L-P-O-T, who was a UT Texas at Austin who committed suicide.
[02:09:27.911 --> 02:09:28.572]  I verified that.
[02:09:28.612 --> 02:09:29.032]  That's true.
[02:09:29.772 --> 02:09:32.354]  Who was involved in that, that disappeared.
[02:09:32.614 --> 02:09:36.137]  And that implicated Bush.
[02:09:36.197 --> 02:09:43.102]  What we have implicating the Bushes is the New York Post top gay porn star services moguls at Bohemian Grove.
[02:09:43.122 --> 02:09:48.826]  What we have is the Washington Times, 1989, you know, midnight cowboy tour of the White House.
[02:09:48.866 --> 02:09:49.866]  But thank you for the call.
[02:09:49.906 --> 02:09:51.227]  That's a lot of information to cover.
[02:09:51.968 --> 02:09:52.668]  Thank you for the call.
[02:09:52.708 --> 02:09:55.771]  Let's let Jim comment on the Bushes.
[02:09:55.851 --> 02:09:56.031]  Jim?
[02:09:56.571 --> 02:09:58.852]  Yes, their names have come up many times.
[02:09:59.032 --> 02:10:05.534]  In one direction, it has come out to be true, but when I look at it the other way, I haven't been able to tie it together.
[02:10:06.074 --> 02:10:10.975]  That doesn't mean it isn't true and it doesn't mean it's false, but there is something to be looked at.
[02:10:11.096 --> 02:10:17.818]  As you know, that name also comes up in the Franklin cover-up case with the stuff going to Washington.
[02:10:18.338 --> 02:10:18.958]  Paul Watson?
[02:10:20.259 --> 02:10:43.691]  Well, I mean, going back to the historical precedence of targeting children, and I mean, obviously nowadays these clandestine organisations use it to compromise people, but also, you know, is it any different for the people who fed their children into the belly of Molec to supposedly further their careers and finances that we see the same elites doing the same thing today?
[02:10:43.711 --> 02:10:47.113]  You know, 45 million abortions since, what, 1973?
[02:10:49.014 --> 02:10:51.256]  So, I mean, you can layer the history over them.
[02:10:51.396 --> 02:10:55.919]  We've got the same people in power doing the same things, and it's no surprise to see it happening.
[02:10:55.979 --> 02:10:57.720]  And we know the Bushes worship Moloch.
[02:10:57.780 --> 02:10:58.241]  I've been there.
[02:10:58.281 --> 02:10:59.181]  I've videotaped it.
[02:10:59.582 --> 02:11:01.183]  They admit I snuck into the Grove.
[02:11:01.223 --> 02:11:02.104]  It's mainstream news.
[02:11:02.424 --> 02:11:05.866]  Yes, Alex got this video, but we disagree with his interpretation.
[02:11:05.926 --> 02:11:07.367]  I mean, what interpretation?
[02:11:07.387 --> 02:11:09.149]  They've got a bound body, effigy of a child.
[02:11:09.189 --> 02:11:11.891]  They burn it before the owl to get rid of their conscience.
[02:11:12.271 --> 02:11:15.373]  Were you aware of Bohemian Grove, Detective?
[02:11:15.593 --> 02:11:17.775]  Yes, I was very much aware of it.
[02:11:19.267 --> 02:11:24.289]  This goes back many, many years, and it got really brought into the forefront.
[02:11:24.749 --> 02:11:27.770]  If you remember Michael Reconosciuto, are you familiar with that name?
[02:11:27.950 --> 02:11:28.210]  Yes.
[02:11:29.090 --> 02:11:34.851]  That was when Reconosciuto decided to go public is when they were going to put him into Bohemian Grove.
[02:11:36.032 --> 02:11:38.873]  And there's a long story behind that, but I know that for a fact.
[02:11:40.513 --> 02:11:40.993]  Oh, boy.
[02:11:41.673 --> 02:11:44.574]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rodney in Texas.
[02:11:44.674 --> 02:11:45.734]  Rodney, you're on the air.
[02:11:45.774 --> 02:11:46.375]  Thanks for holding.
[02:11:46.575 --> 02:11:47.775]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[02:11:49.096 --> 02:11:51.057]  I want to first of all commend you, Alex.
[02:11:51.418 --> 02:11:56.840]  The last couple of days you've had some guests on your show that have absolutely been riveting.
[02:11:58.421 --> 02:12:03.183]  It's sad that these things are coming out now.
[02:12:05.010 --> 02:12:13.615]  They have to come out, and I'm glad that I'm listening to them, and I just hope that you continue to bring this information to the floor, to the public.
[02:12:14.115 --> 02:12:16.916]  I have two questions, quick questions, for both of your guests.
[02:12:17.417 --> 02:12:18.477]  One for Paul Watson.
[02:12:19.037 --> 02:12:22.959]  Your book, Order Out of Chaos, does it cover any of the events of 9-11?
[02:12:23.340 --> 02:12:29.863]  And for Detective Rothstein, I'm curious about the John Denae Ramsey case.
[02:12:30.524 --> 02:12:34.167]  Okay, so it looked like that was a whitewash, and I'd like to get your answer.
[02:12:34.187 --> 02:12:35.268]  I'll take it off to Aaron.
[02:12:35.308 --> 02:12:36.248]  Thank you very kindly.
[02:12:36.509 --> 02:12:37.409]  Okay, thanks Rodney.
[02:12:37.469 --> 02:12:37.750]  Paul?
[02:12:38.891 --> 02:12:42.373]  I believe the question was, does it cover any of the events of 9-11?
[02:12:42.974 --> 02:12:53.762]  Basically, the spine of the book, the middle three chapters cover the foreknowledge before, the involvement with the terrorists, and then the event itself and what they got out of it.
[02:12:53.782 --> 02:12:55.883]  So three chapters of the book do cover 9-11.
[02:12:57.122 --> 02:12:58.563]  And those are the three biggest chapters.
[02:12:58.623 --> 02:12:59.483]  I'd say half the book.
[02:12:59.823 --> 02:13:01.084]  That's right, yeah.
[02:13:01.224 --> 02:13:09.688]  And then the first part of the book is the history of government-sponsored terror, why they do it, then 9-11, and then after that, Paul gets into the whole police state.
[02:13:09.728 --> 02:13:11.349]  It's an excellent 322-page book or 324-page book.
[02:13:11.369 --> 02:13:13.710]  And you can get my book and Paul's book for $19.95, over 550 pages for $19.95.
[02:13:14.410 --> 02:13:16.191]  Two books full of graphics, documents, photos.
[02:13:25.889 --> 02:13:32.913]  Again, go to Infowars.com to order it or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:13:33.054 --> 02:13:36.236]  He had a question.
[02:13:36.856 --> 02:13:39.598]  Rodney had a question for you about JonBenet Ramsey.
[02:13:39.858 --> 02:13:46.963]  Yes, although I didn't personally work on the case, I did get quite a bit of information, and it wasn't from the Main Street media.
[02:13:47.924 --> 02:13:53.728]  One of the particular things that they did there is right away go after the parents so that nobody would look at anything else.
[02:13:54.318 --> 02:14:02.540]  The information I had that there was some type of operation going on out there that would have targeted her and other kids in that area.
[02:14:02.640 --> 02:14:10.761]  And I think that's where the investigation was stopped and they started blaming the parents, which I don't believe had anything to do with it.
[02:14:12.162 --> 02:14:12.562]  All righty.
[02:14:12.742 --> 02:14:16.303]  Let's go ahead and talk to Paul in Tennessee.
[02:14:16.363 --> 02:14:17.203]  Paul, you're on the air.
[02:14:17.243 --> 02:14:17.523]  Go ahead.
[02:14:17.543 --> 02:14:18.243]  Hello, Alex.
[02:14:18.643 --> 02:14:18.903]  Hello.
[02:14:18.923 --> 02:14:20.963]  May you be blessed forever.
[02:14:20.984 --> 02:14:23.224]  I'm going to make this quick.
[02:14:24.548 --> 02:14:28.069]  I have a four-minute audio tape recorded in a thunderstorm.
[02:14:28.089 --> 02:14:31.730]  As I said, it runs about four minutes.
[02:14:31.770 --> 02:14:35.011]  You can listen to one minute of it if you wish.
[02:14:36.792 --> 02:14:38.833]  On hearing it, I'm sure you'll want to copy.
[02:14:38.853 --> 02:14:40.013]  It's coming up.
[02:15:11.555 --> 02:15:14.878]  America is now under martial law.
[02:15:14.958 --> 02:15:21.142]  All constitutional rights have been suspended.
[02:15:21.182 --> 02:15:24.305]  Stay in your homes.
[02:15:24.485 --> 02:15:29.308]  Do not attempt to conduct... Go ahead and put him on hold.
[02:15:30.209 --> 02:15:33.631]  Yeah, that was theme music I used about five, six years ago.
[02:15:34.292 --> 02:15:35.573]  It's a Jell-O Biafra.
[02:15:36.293 --> 02:15:39.636]  And that title track, that particular track is on the ICT...
[02:15:42.430 --> 02:15:43.651]  CD I've got somewhere.
[02:15:43.671 --> 02:15:44.391]  I ought to play that.
[02:15:44.892 --> 02:15:46.453]  I need to get that in the computer up there and use it.
[02:15:46.473 --> 02:15:47.855]  I've heard some of the other shows using it.
[02:15:48.315 --> 02:15:52.499]  But did you know what that was, Paul?
[02:15:53.700 --> 02:15:56.183]  Yeah, I think we posted it on the website years ago.
[02:15:56.203 --> 02:15:59.045]  So I can probably try and dig it up again.
[02:15:59.105 --> 02:16:02.068]  Hey, why don't you tell the folks who are on the show where that's at, Paul?
[02:16:02.108 --> 02:16:04.010]  And we'll get them to play it on air for people.
[02:16:04.777 --> 02:16:05.318]  I'll try.
[02:16:05.358 --> 02:16:08.440]  I can't remember where it is exactly, but I'll have a look.
[02:16:08.500 --> 02:16:12.043]  I think the CD's actually in this office somewhere, but there's hundreds of CDs.
[02:16:12.764 --> 02:16:13.564]  Anything else, Paul?
[02:16:18.348 --> 02:16:19.669]  He's still playing it.
[02:16:20.170 --> 02:16:21.471]  All right, thanks for the call, Paul.
[02:16:22.491 --> 02:16:28.436]  You know what, Jim Rothstein, it seems like we are going into martial law in America.
[02:16:28.456 --> 02:16:29.317]  Your comments on that?
[02:16:29.901 --> 02:16:32.343]  Well, I don't know.
[02:16:32.763 --> 02:16:34.905]  Sometimes you wonder what's really going on.
[02:16:35.686 --> 02:16:38.888]  And again, it's up to us to stop this stuff.
[02:16:39.249 --> 02:16:43.232]  And only people like you who put on shows like this can help and do it.
[02:16:43.352 --> 02:16:48.916]  And that's why I'm always willing to do a show anytime we can get this out to the public.
[02:16:49.257 --> 02:16:54.141]  But as a society, I mean, it's not just this group creeping around under the floorboards.
[02:16:54.561 --> 02:16:56.823]  We see their agenda everywhere around us.
[02:16:57.343 --> 02:16:58.024]  Most certainly.
[02:16:58.064 --> 02:16:59.285]  They're out in the public now.
[02:16:59.870 --> 02:17:01.211]  And the people just have to look.
[02:17:01.792 --> 02:17:02.872]  It's all over the place.
[02:17:03.533 --> 02:17:13.681]  I read like a Reuters article years ago where this, I don't want to say his name, but this top mogul CEO of a major computer company gave like $80 million to Nambla.
[02:17:14.802 --> 02:17:16.603]  Oh, I don't remember hearing about that one.
[02:17:16.663 --> 02:17:17.084]  Oh, yeah.
[02:17:17.424 --> 02:17:19.926]  Nambla was very powerful and still is.
[02:17:20.987 --> 02:17:26.211]  Even with Shanley gone, it's just amazing how the people condone them to even operate.
[02:17:27.429 --> 02:17:29.591]  That is a disgrace that's beyond belief.
[02:17:29.711 --> 02:17:31.933]  Well, Jim Rothstein, I want to thank you for coming on with us.
[02:17:31.953 --> 02:17:32.834]  Thank you for having me.
[02:17:32.874 --> 02:17:33.834]  Bye.
[02:17:33.895 --> 02:17:34.095]  Sir?
[02:17:34.735 --> 02:17:35.556]  Yeah.
[02:17:36.116 --> 02:17:38.118]  Would you like to give out contact info or anything?
[02:17:38.158 --> 02:17:41.181]  Well, if they want, they can call your show and you can get them in touch with me.
[02:17:41.201 --> 02:17:41.501]  All right.
[02:17:41.521 --> 02:17:41.941]  God bless you.
[02:17:41.961 --> 02:17:42.342]  Thank you.
[02:17:42.962 --> 02:17:44.223]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[02:17:44.263 --> 02:17:45.264]  We've got Paul Watson with us.
[02:17:47.306 --> 02:17:47.826]  Hi, folks.
[02:17:47.866 --> 02:17:49.628]  Jack Browning from Midas Resources.
[02:17:49.648 --> 02:17:50.929]  The real money, folks.
[02:17:54.221 --> 02:17:57.564]  Let's review a few things from the past year, November 2003 to November 2004.
[02:17:57.604 --> 02:17:59.585]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300, a 5% increase.
[02:18:00.166 --> 02:18:05.791]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro, a 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[02:18:15.484 --> 02:18:21.127]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s, a 16% increase in real money.
[02:18:21.727 --> 02:18:24.768]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[02:18:25.329 --> 02:18:30.471]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:33.032 --> 02:18:35.693]  Remember, gold is liquid, private, and portable.

[02:18:39.755 --> 02:18:41.156]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[02:18:46.261 --> 02:18:48.763]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:18:49.443 --> 02:18:59.090]  Did you know that modern technology has devised a barcode that fits inside a tiny microchip that can be placed under the skin of dogs and children to track them everywhere they go?
[02:19:00.090 --> 02:19:09.617]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that will let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[02:19:10.652 --> 02:19:16.157]  It's the coming 666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation chapter 13.
[02:19:16.937 --> 02:19:24.683]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch magazine.

[02:19:58.755 --> 02:20:03.438]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:20:03.898 --> 02:20:10.623]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:20:11.023 --> 02:20:22.812]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:20:23.272 --> 02:20:27.737]  The Berkey Lights rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[02:20:34.985 --> 02:20:36.046]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:20:45.257 --> 02:20:46.298]  Are you losing your hair?
[02:20:46.638 --> 02:20:48.080]  Is that bald spot getting bigger?
[02:20:48.420 --> 02:20:49.581]  Is your hair looking thinner?
[02:20:50.101 --> 02:20:51.763]  Why aren't you using Avacor?
[02:20:51.983 --> 02:20:56.587]  The hair growth treatment that has helped thousands of people just like you regrow their hair.

[02:21:02.472 --> 02:21:03.213]  It works.
[02:21:03.593 --> 02:21:06.075]  My hair hasn't looked this good in over 15 years.
[02:21:07.615 --> 02:21:12.439]  If you're losing your hair and haven't tried Avacor yet, how about a free month's supply?

[02:21:42.216 --> 02:21:44.336]  Let's go to calls right now.
[02:21:44.356 --> 02:21:49.477]  Are you game for that?
[02:21:49.497 --> 02:21:49.597]  Yep.
[02:21:49.617 --> 02:21:50.878]  All right, let's do it.
[02:21:50.898 --> 02:21:52.418]  Omar in Michigan, and Ron, Tom.
[02:21:52.498 --> 02:21:52.998]  Omar, go ahead.
[02:22:04.531 --> 02:22:05.572]  It's getting to the telephone.
[02:22:06.633 --> 02:22:07.033]  Hello!
[02:22:09.355 --> 02:22:09.775]  He's there.
[02:22:09.795 --> 02:22:11.136]  He just didn't listen or something.
[02:22:11.977 --> 02:22:13.177]  Ron in New York.
[02:22:13.297 --> 02:22:14.118]  Ron, you're on the air.
[02:22:14.198 --> 02:22:14.638]  Go ahead.
[02:22:17.100 --> 02:22:17.761]  Alex.
[02:22:18.461 --> 02:22:18.742]  Yes.
[02:22:19.182 --> 02:22:19.722]  God bless you.
[02:22:19.762 --> 02:22:20.743]  How are you doing?
[02:22:20.783 --> 02:22:21.163]  Go ahead.
[02:22:21.183 --> 02:22:21.684]  Who is this?
[02:22:22.064 --> 02:22:22.905]  This is Ron in New York.
[02:22:23.065 --> 02:22:23.645]  Go ahead, Ron.
[02:22:23.885 --> 02:22:29.910]  Did you get the tape on the house I live in and I sent you with a letter?
[02:22:30.610 --> 02:22:31.451]  Yes, I got your letter.
[02:22:31.491 --> 02:22:31.951]  Thank you, sir.
[02:22:32.432 --> 02:22:32.532]  And...
[02:22:33.848 --> 02:22:36.991]  I don't know, do you have any ideas about getting that CD?
[02:22:37.031 --> 02:22:39.093]  Because I don't think you can play the ones that I sent.
[02:22:39.133 --> 02:22:42.296]  They weren't that clear, but one of them wasn't too bad.
[02:22:42.356 --> 02:22:44.519]  Well, I actually own those Frank Sinatra songs.
[02:22:44.599 --> 02:22:44.979]  You do?
[02:22:45.339 --> 02:22:45.520]  Yeah.
[02:22:45.800 --> 02:22:48.002]  Any idea about playing those on the air?
[02:22:48.062 --> 02:22:50.004]  Well, I don't really play music very often.
[02:22:50.284 --> 02:22:54.108]  It's a talk show, but I mean, I might play some Frank Sinatra songs.
[02:22:54.689 --> 02:22:56.370]  No, I mean, as a theme, you know, to...
[02:22:58.610 --> 02:22:59.511]  Rally the people in.
[02:22:59.531 --> 02:23:00.952]  That's a great song to do that.
[02:23:01.292 --> 02:23:02.073]  It is a great song.
[02:23:02.093 --> 02:23:02.953]  What else is on your mind?
[02:23:03.394 --> 02:23:03.914]  Kate Smith.
[02:23:03.954 --> 02:23:05.415]  I put Kate Smith on there too.
[02:23:05.475 --> 02:23:06.436]  You know her rendition.
[02:23:06.476 --> 02:23:07.797]  God bless America.
[02:23:07.957 --> 02:23:12.561]  David Icke has something in his book on 9-11 about Bush Sr.
[02:23:13.261 --> 02:23:13.802]  and a woman.
[02:23:14.002 --> 02:23:22.789]  He has quotes there from her about being a sex slave and her daughter also with Bush Sr.
[02:23:23.069 --> 02:23:24.010]  It's in his book on 9-11.
[02:23:25.633 --> 02:23:26.214]  I know.
[02:23:26.254 --> 02:23:27.495]  There's a lot of amazing stuff.
[02:23:28.315 --> 02:23:30.337]  I can't confirm that stuff, so I don't really cover it.
[02:23:30.817 --> 02:23:31.458]  God bless you.
[02:23:31.898 --> 02:23:32.118]  All right.
[02:23:32.138 --> 02:23:32.679]  Thank you for the call.
[02:23:32.739 --> 02:23:33.760]  I appreciate the CD.
[02:23:34.880 --> 02:23:35.421]  Let's talk to Tom.
[02:23:35.481 --> 02:23:37.042]  Tom, where are you calling us from?
[02:23:37.062 --> 02:23:39.964]  How are you doing today?
[02:23:40.265 --> 02:23:40.485]  Good.
[02:23:40.505 --> 02:23:41.245]  I'm doing good.
[02:23:41.485 --> 02:23:41.826]  Go ahead.
[02:23:42.006 --> 02:23:43.327]  Did you get the first podcast in Missouri?
[02:23:44.276 --> 02:23:49.199]  Anyways, I just want to tell you something that I heard on NPR a couple weeks ago that got me thinking.
[02:23:49.600 --> 02:23:57.565]  They were talking about all the new security measures and basically the security industry getting put in place with this whole martial law thing coming down.
[02:23:57.865 --> 02:23:59.426]  And they used a very interesting term.
[02:23:59.466 --> 02:24:01.708]  It was called the security industrial complex.
[02:24:02.328 --> 02:24:11.716]  And once I started thinking about it, and I started thinking about what Eisenhower said about the military-industrial complex, and anybody out there that has any question where this is going, all they need to do is look at history.
[02:24:11.796 --> 02:24:15.739]  Look what happened when the military-industrial complex was in full swing.
[02:24:15.759 --> 02:24:19.683]  I mean, I've even used that term as the security complex.
[02:24:20.023 --> 02:24:24.627]  What's happened is the military-industrial complex now gets most of the budget, they run the country,
[02:24:25.007 --> 02:24:26.688]  Now they're making us all the enemy.
[02:24:26.708 --> 02:24:27.068]  Absolutely.
[02:24:27.168 --> 02:24:35.151]  And they're taking over the society and private firms, you know, 7 million people in private prisons, competing against the rest of us at 20 cents an hour.
[02:24:35.491 --> 02:24:37.692]  I mean, it's all very, very serious.
[02:24:37.732 --> 02:24:38.292]  Paul Watson?
[02:24:39.393 --> 02:24:40.253]  Well, that's the case.
[02:24:40.653 --> 02:24:54.419]  And the way they'll get the security industrial complex on a day-to-day level is by targeting, as we talked about earlier, these soft targets, which will lead to you seeing armored police in shopping malls
[02:24:55.245 --> 02:25:07.277]  I mean, they have guards there at the moment, but they'll get all the full riot gear and you'll see them on every street corner because of the targeting of soft targets, which will make people believe that their day-to-day activities are under threat.
[02:25:07.417 --> 02:25:12.843]  Which the government's now getting us ready for with massive fear-mongering right now.
[02:25:14.136 --> 02:25:16.038]  Yeah, I'm targeting the food supply as well.
[02:25:17.259 --> 02:25:20.482]  What else were they saying on this NPR piece?
[02:25:20.502 --> 02:25:22.444]  To tell you the truth, it was late at night.
[02:25:22.484 --> 02:25:28.529]  I caught only a little bit of it, but they were basically completely advocating the entire implementation of the structure.
[02:25:28.569 --> 02:25:29.710]  It was just ridiculous.
[02:25:30.711 --> 02:25:32.473]  It was almost like it was scripted.
[02:25:33.030 --> 02:25:46.276]  I mean, and it was insane that there was actually people calling in and agreeing and advocating that, you know, this is the right thing, that, you know, armed thugs on the corner, you know, scanning our irises is the way to go if we want to be safe, and that is not the way to go.
[02:25:46.296 --> 02:25:47.276]  But not on the border, though.
[02:25:47.296 --> 02:25:48.797]  Can't put those guys on the border.
[02:25:49.077 --> 02:25:49.977]  Gotta leave that open.
[02:25:50.077 --> 02:25:54.359]  Yeah, we can fence, you know, tens of thousands of miles of highways, but we can't fence a border.
[02:25:54.939 --> 02:25:57.561]  Well, they can fence all of Afghanistan, but on our border.
[02:25:57.741 --> 02:25:58.842]  Yeah, it's ridiculous.
[02:25:58.922 --> 02:25:59.582]  One more quick thing.
[02:26:00.483 --> 02:26:06.807]  I just joined up for PrisonPlanet.tv this morning, and I watched the first third of your new video, and anybody out there that...
[02:26:07.546 --> 02:26:14.972]  Hasn't signed up and hasn't checked it out yet, get out there, scrape up pennies, get a money order, send it to you, check it out, because, I mean, they don't know what they're missing.
[02:26:14.992 --> 02:26:17.214]  And I just want to thank you for all the time and work you guys put in.
[02:26:17.594 --> 02:26:20.056]  Well, download copies of the film and give them to people.
[02:26:20.116 --> 02:26:24.960]  I mean, 15 cents a day to be a member of PrisonPlanet.tv, and thank you for the call, sir.
[02:26:26.181 --> 02:26:27.522]  Now, he brings up a really good point.
[02:26:27.542 --> 02:26:35.749]  I mean, they're telling us that we're going to have the shopping malls and schools hit, so we've got to have metal detectors and armed guards in those, as if Al-Qaeda really existed.
[02:26:36.554 --> 02:26:42.682]  And it's not some CIA attack, which they've called for in Operation Gladiola and others, Operation Northwoods.
[02:26:43.042 --> 02:26:47.908]  That's not going to stop somebody with machine guns going in if there's armed police inside a mall.
[02:26:49.153 --> 02:26:49.994]  Well, no, it's not.
[02:26:50.534 --> 02:27:05.524]  The point about convincing us that Al-Qaeda is running around our back gardens is what they've done here in Britain with these 500 so-called terror arrests in London, two of which they actually charged with immigration fraud.
[02:27:05.564 --> 02:27:12.929]  So none of the 500 suspects arrested had any evidence tied to them involving terrorism.
[02:27:12.989 --> 02:27:16.431]  But that was in the back of the paper after the mass arrests were on the front page.
[02:27:16.491 --> 02:27:17.572]  So that's how you get people...
[02:27:18.112 --> 02:27:23.674]  Believing this myth that these terrorists are running around their back garden and threatening to disrupt their day-to-day life.
[02:27:24.694 --> 02:27:28.615]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with the news, and later we'll take some more calls.
[02:27:28.635 --> 02:27:29.076]  Stay with us.
[02:27:36.138 --> 02:27:37.058]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.538 --> 02:27:39.139]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.059 --> 02:27:42.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.678 --> 02:27:50.201]  Diabetics worldwide are experiencing tremendous success in lowering blood sugar and blood pressure.
[02:27:50.521 --> 02:27:52.522]  Attention diabetics and health-conscious Americans.

[02:28:33.877 --> 02:28:35.699]  See the toxic conspiracy video at www.sugarbalance.org
[02:28:45.728 --> 02:28:50.330]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[02:28:50.550 --> 02:28:54.992]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[02:28:55.172 --> 02:29:09.198]  The Security Pack includes a Berkey light water purifier, an LED base, two Berkey sport filtration bottles, the Berkey battery adapter, the Berkey MP solar charger, as well as a backup set of two Black Berkey purification elements.
[02:29:09.378 --> 02:29:09.778]  We're good to go.
[02:29:09.798 --> 02:29:10.399]  We're good to go.
[02:29:38.114 --> 02:29:41.855]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:42.455 --> 02:29:43.855]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:29:45.516 --> 02:29:47.876]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:29:48.116 --> 02:29:51.957]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[02:29:52.277 --> 02:29:53.097]  Read the labels.
[02:29:53.517 --> 02:29:57.658]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:29:57.878 --> 02:30:02.059]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:30:02.439 --> 02:30:07.300]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:30:07.700 --> 02:30:11.282]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:30:11.462 --> 02:30:16.805]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.

[02:30:34.875 --> 02:30:37.237]  Time Magazine, The New York Times, CNN, USA Today.
[02:30:59.443 --> 02:31:02.484]  The terrorists are planning to hit public schools.
[02:31:02.524 --> 02:31:05.045]  They're planning to hit shopping malls.
[02:31:05.845 --> 02:31:08.126]  And the FBI is saying we need armed guards.
[02:31:08.206 --> 02:31:10.107]  We need face scanning cameras.
[02:31:10.147 --> 02:31:11.367]  We need metal detectors.
[02:31:11.948 --> 02:31:12.568]  Everywhere.
[02:31:13.568 --> 02:31:18.270]  Everywhere, as if someone who has weapons is going to be stopped by armed guards.
[02:31:18.290 --> 02:31:22.031]  I mean, how many guards would it take to really defend a mall, a large mall?
[02:31:22.452 --> 02:31:23.252]  Hundreds.
[02:31:24.924 --> 02:31:25.424]  Hundreds.
[02:31:25.544 --> 02:31:26.045]  Oh, but don't worry.
[02:31:26.085 --> 02:31:37.090]  The military industrial complex will give you the private agency troops that are paid exorbitantly and then, of course, won't have any real terrorists to deal with, so they'll, quote, fight crime while they're at it.
[02:31:37.930 --> 02:31:44.773]  They're saying these checkpoints, these road tolls are going to have the police there, trained by the TSA, the airport thugs, have to do this to you.
[02:31:44.853 --> 02:31:52.236]  And they said, back in January, the 21st on Bush's inauguration, they said, this is the model for the country.
[02:31:52.516 --> 02:31:53.637]  For every four people
[02:31:54.418 --> 02:31:57.601]  Out there, there was a cop, and over them was the military.
[02:31:58.362 --> 02:32:00.124]  And it was total police state.
[02:32:00.544 --> 02:32:02.806]  Paul Watson, they know what they're doing, don't they?
[02:32:03.807 --> 02:32:05.068]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[02:32:05.909 --> 02:32:10.714]  We talked about Gladio earlier, where that was the very direction the whole program.
[02:32:11.374 --> 02:32:19.242]  To whip up the people into a state of fear, whereby they would entrust all their trust and liberty into the hands of the state to protect them.
[02:32:19.944 --> 02:32:33.467]  And then on the flip side of this targeting of the soft targets, the schools, the shopping malls, on the back side of the so-called Al-Zaqawi-Bin Laden partnership, which is targeting America.
[02:32:33.967 --> 02:32:37.788]  Again, Bin Laden hasn't been seen for three years.
[02:32:38.668 --> 02:32:44.209]  Al-Zaqawi has never been photographed at all, even in Iraq, where he supposedly operates.
[02:32:45.719 --> 02:32:51.183]  On the flip side, we get this leaked FBI report which says there are no Al-Qaeda cells in America.
[02:32:51.223 --> 02:33:00.688]  They have no capability of targeting America because the facts are that the real Al-Qaeda are just a loosely knit group of fanatics in the Middle East.
[02:33:00.768 --> 02:33:02.389]  They have no organized structure.
[02:33:03.210 --> 02:33:06.231]  The word Al-Qaeda in Arabic means the toilet.
[02:33:06.632 --> 02:33:12.475]  I really think that these people would name their awesome, impressive terrorist group after, you know, the toilet.
[02:33:13.155 --> 02:33:13.416]  And then...
[02:33:14.918 --> 02:33:19.042]  We have the evidence of the White House scripting fake terror alerts.
[02:33:19.062 --> 02:33:24.728]  We've got Scott Ritter coming out this week saying the neocon brown shirts have resorted to terror tactics.
[02:33:25.269 --> 02:33:34.959]  And then the admission on the record that FBI agents have come out and blown the whistle on that they scripted... Well, Paul, we have a gigantic section on the websites of fake terror alerts.
[02:33:35.689 --> 02:33:36.249]  That's right.
[02:33:36.269 --> 02:33:41.052]  I mean, maybe you should pull that up in front of you right now and just read people headlines.
[02:33:41.092 --> 02:33:42.552]  Of course, it would take hours.
[02:33:43.012 --> 02:33:46.074]  But I mean, they admittedly issue fake alerts, folks.
[02:33:46.114 --> 02:33:48.655]  That is the definition of terrorism.
[02:33:49.235 --> 02:33:51.777]  Scaring people to get what you want politically out of them.
[02:33:52.977 --> 02:33:54.338]  Yeah, I mean, here's the archive.
[02:33:54.378 --> 02:33:56.859]  Terrorists on Ashcross wanted list already in jail.
[02:33:57.909 --> 02:34:00.211]  Macedonia staged terrorist killings to win U.S.
[02:34:00.231 --> 02:34:03.673]  support, which is what Uzbekistan does, as I spoke about earlier.
[02:34:04.133 --> 02:34:05.834]  CIA faked German terror alert.
[02:34:05.894 --> 02:34:07.976]  France finds no evidence of hijacked plot.
[02:34:08.516 --> 02:34:11.318]  ABC News suicide bomber threat turns out to be false.
[02:34:11.518 --> 02:34:14.400]  Bin Laden videos compilation repeat, says expert.
[02:34:14.760 --> 02:34:16.441]  Bin Laden tape is old material.
[02:34:17.262 --> 02:34:21.945]  Bin Laden's right-hand man in new videotape, Alza Wahari, was arrested 18 months ago.
[02:34:23.440 --> 02:34:25.903]  Some US attack threats fabricated.
[02:34:26.123 --> 02:34:27.485]  Terror alerts manufactured.
[02:34:28.125 --> 02:34:29.587]  US terror alert a hoax.
[02:34:29.667 --> 02:34:30.908]  Bin Laden tape a fake.
[02:34:30.969 --> 02:34:33.572]  Another dubious Bin Laden tape.
[02:34:34.072 --> 02:34:36.195]  Pakistan arrest Al-Qaeda poses.
[02:34:36.415 --> 02:34:42.622]  Palestinian, sorry, which is where the Mossad Israeli intelligence created a fake Al-Qaeda group.
[02:34:43.371 --> 02:34:47.533]  And then, you know, the FBI, the White House scripting hysterics.
[02:34:48.053 --> 02:34:48.853]  So it's all there.
[02:34:48.873 --> 02:34:53.515]  I mean, that archive hasn't actually been updated in a while, which we're doing at the moment.
[02:34:53.575 --> 02:34:56.356]  So that's just going up to the middle of last year.
[02:34:56.576 --> 02:34:58.057]  We've had so much more since.
[02:34:58.826 --> 02:35:00.609]  Now let's spend a little more time on Gladio.
[02:35:00.629 --> 02:35:02.411]  The listeners know about Northwoods.
[02:35:15.109 --> 02:35:15.890]  The official U.S.
[02:35:15.930 --> 02:35:26.218]  government terror plan to hijack jets by remote control, crash and bomb D.C., commit sniper attacks, attack Marine Corps bases with our own troops dressed up like foreigners, to blame it on foreign enemies.
[02:35:26.559 --> 02:35:29.601]  We know about that, but some people really don't know about Gladio.
[02:35:29.681 --> 02:35:39.049]  I mention it, show a few news articles about it in the Masters of Terror, but this is public, this is admitted, this is as big as Northwoods.
[02:35:39.069 --> 02:35:39.809]  Tell folks about it.
[02:35:41.371 --> 02:35:42.892]  The main thing about Gladio is that
[02:35:43.619 --> 02:36:08.139]  It was portrayed as being set up by the right-wing governments of Italy and Spain, but you go back to the foundation of it, which is in the documents on the National Security Archive and the Pentagon Field Manual, and it was set up by P2 Money, which was an organisation tied into the CIA, and it was an umbrella operation of the CIA, as the documents came out and stated.
[02:36:08.823 --> 02:36:19.910]  And it was a program to discredit the left-wing groups at the time by carrying out terrorist attacks and then blaming them on left-wing and communist groups.
[02:36:19.930 --> 02:36:22.492]  And in every case they were soft targets.
[02:36:23.152 --> 02:36:27.375]  Trains, the train station in Bologna got attacked, 80-plus people died.
[02:36:28.435 --> 02:36:31.237]  Schools, assassinations, kidnappings, murders.
[02:36:32.112 --> 02:36:37.096]  And it was designed to make people put their trust in the strong men of the time.
[02:36:37.396 --> 02:36:43.900]  That was the very basis of the program, and it's what they said they did it for, in their own words, and the agents who were involved in it.
[02:36:44.701 --> 02:36:54.688]  Now, about three years ago, this came out in the Associated Press and the Guardian, and the head of the Italian intelligence agency said, yeah, the government did carry this out, but it was under U.S.
[02:36:54.748 --> 02:36:57.630]  and British orders, and they would actually do the bombings for us.
[02:36:59.139 --> 02:37:03.604]  And there's one particular quote in there by the head of the intelligence agency.
[02:37:03.664 --> 02:37:07.287]  Read that quote to folks of why he said they were carrying out these attacks.
[02:37:08.308 --> 02:37:10.811]  I haven't got it in front of me, but I can find it in a second.
[02:37:11.011 --> 02:37:21.441]  Yeah, we read it in the first hour, but this is really important stuff because here is the establishment, just again, and I talked about this the last few months,
[02:37:22.114 --> 02:37:27.756]  I heard Kermit Roosevelt, the grandson of the president, who ran the operation overthrowing Mosaddegh.
[02:37:27.776 --> 02:37:29.736]  They said they want democracy in the Middle East.
[02:37:30.476 --> 02:37:32.497]  Mosaddegh was anti-communist, pro-West.
[02:37:32.517 --> 02:37:33.677]  He'd thrown the communists out.
[02:37:34.038 --> 02:37:36.278]  He said, you can have 75% of the oil money.
[02:37:36.318 --> 02:37:36.898]  They said, no.
[02:37:37.338 --> 02:37:38.539]  We want 98%.
[02:37:39.359 --> 02:37:40.179]  He said, no way.
[02:37:40.239 --> 02:37:42.240]  My people need this money for our own oil.
[02:37:42.935 --> 02:37:57.542]  You know, he was a secular leader, and they hired 2,000 thugs for several weeks, blew up mosques, machine gun people, cheering up with Mosaddegh, up with communism, and then the people overthrew Mosaddegh, they put in the Shah, and folks,
[02:37:58.354 --> 02:38:00.015]  It is admitted.
[02:38:00.195 --> 02:38:01.415]  They got on the air.
[02:38:01.435 --> 02:38:03.616]  The people that did it, they were proud of themselves.
[02:38:04.036 --> 02:38:06.477]  And they admit it on national radio.
[02:38:06.877 --> 02:38:08.638]  Yes, we did it and we're proud of it.
[02:38:08.878 --> 02:38:10.298]  And look at the great job we did.
[02:38:10.318 --> 02:38:13.359]  I mean, killing people and blaming it on someone.
[02:38:13.660 --> 02:38:15.360]  Folks, have you figured this out yet, Paul?
[02:38:16.361 --> 02:38:18.441]  Yeah, I've got the quotes here.
[02:38:18.641 --> 02:38:22.983]  The Italian Senate did an investigation in 2000 and concluded that
[02:38:24.405 --> 02:38:34.923]  The 1980 bombing of the Bologna train station had been carried out by men inside Italian state institutions and men linked to the structures of United States intelligence.
[02:38:35.898 --> 02:38:46.628]  One of the agents in Gladio who later testified said, quote, you had to attack civilians, the people, women, children, innocent people, unknown people far removed from any political game.
[02:38:47.008 --> 02:38:52.793]  The reason was quite simple, to force the public to turn to the state to ask for greater security.
[02:38:53.654 --> 02:38:55.956]  And then the Pentagon Field Manual FM 3031B said,
[02:38:57.918 --> 02:39:08.772]  Stated, US Army intelligence must have the means of launching special operations which will convince host country governments and public opinion of the reality of the insurgent danger.
[02:39:09.192 --> 02:39:15.500]  Naturally, these peace-throttling special operations must remain strictly secret, the document warns.
[02:39:16.519 --> 02:39:30.066]  So that was the genesis of it, and the rhetoric is similar to Operation Northwoods, which called for carrying out terrorist attacks to be blamed then on Cuba to rally public opinion against Cuba to create a war on Cuba.
[02:39:30.086 --> 02:39:32.027]  So that was its genesis to Northwoods.
[02:39:33.425 --> 02:39:35.406]  And again, they sell the people that carry this out.
[02:39:35.487 --> 02:39:37.168]  Man, we're fighting commies.
[02:39:37.588 --> 02:39:40.090]  Meanwhile, our own government was funding all the top communists.
[02:39:40.110 --> 02:39:40.790]  That's now admitted.
[02:39:41.050 --> 02:39:42.812]  Fortune 500 moves to China.
[02:39:43.472 --> 02:39:45.674]  And then today it's, we've got to fight the Muslims.
[02:39:45.714 --> 02:39:46.534]  They're deadly.
[02:39:47.095 --> 02:39:50.237]  Meanwhile, the terror attacks are coming from the globalists.
[02:39:51.137 --> 02:39:55.440]  And Paul, you know, I really feel in my gut they're getting ready for big attacks.
[02:39:55.460 --> 02:39:57.022]  Do you think it's going to be in Europe?
[02:39:57.042 --> 02:39:58.402]  Do you think it's going to be here in the U.S.?
[02:39:58.423 --> 02:39:59.603]  Or do you think it's not coming?
[02:39:59.643 --> 02:40:01.805]  I mean, how do we stop them is the second question.
[02:40:02.908 --> 02:40:05.030]  I don't think it's coming this year.
[02:40:05.070 --> 02:40:06.571]  I think it'll mainly be next year.
[02:40:07.272 --> 02:40:11.175]  You'll probably see soft target attacks in the Midwest, USA.
[02:40:12.636 --> 02:40:19.161]  That whole scripted movie thing in California where Schwarzenegger comes to the rescue is something I'm sure they'd love to do.
[02:40:20.021 --> 02:40:23.024]  So it's going to be over the next two years, definitely.
[02:40:23.044 --> 02:40:31.390]  But I mean, the positive news is that we've backed them off three and a half years, approaching four years since 9-11 from carrying out anything major.
[02:40:32.031 --> 02:40:33.352]  And that's solely down to us.
[02:40:33.432 --> 02:40:51.105]  It's solely down to them seeing the polls, seeing that 50% of New Yorkers believe that they were involved in 9-11, which is why they're having to resort to fear-mongering about these soft targets now, because there's less likelihood of them getting caught if they carry out these operations on a smaller scale.
[02:40:51.696 --> 02:40:54.298]  Well, definitely, it will go smaller scale.
[02:40:54.318 --> 02:41:01.244]  They'll probably try and turn America into Israel, where basically everything is under secure command.
[02:41:01.264 --> 02:41:06.147]  You've got troops on the streets because you've got bus bombings, soft target attacks every other week.
[02:41:06.227 --> 02:41:08.249]  So that's probably the way they're heading now.
[02:41:08.910 --> 02:41:17.276]  And by the way, there are real useful idiot Muslim groups who don't like Christians, don't like Jews, don't like anybody.
[02:41:17.336 --> 02:41:20.619]  But by and large, and this is where Rot's Jerusalem Post...
[02:41:22.003 --> 02:41:35.029]  Huge Al-Qaeda teams are really young Palestinians captured when they're young, tortured, then trained and paid by Israeli Shin Bet and Mossad and they've been caught carrying out bombings, folks.
[02:41:35.409 --> 02:41:38.211]  That's mainstream Israeli news.
[02:41:38.251 --> 02:41:39.431]  That's not coming from us.
[02:41:40.772 --> 02:41:42.413]  Well, that was actually in Reuters.
[02:41:43.753 --> 02:41:45.474]  The Palestinians arrested
[02:41:46.487 --> 02:41:52.566]  A so-called Hamas terrorist group, and it turned out to be a Mossad front.
[02:41:54.174 --> 02:41:58.036]  Same case with the so-called Al-Qaeda group, which also turned out to be a Mossad front.
[02:41:58.717 --> 02:42:00.418]  So, I mean, you've got the history there.
[02:42:00.458 --> 02:42:08.163]  You've also got it where our government and others fund, and you'll have one of the Muslim leaders who's a government agent who just lives for decade after decade.
[02:42:08.823 --> 02:42:10.104]  That's what Barry Hamish will tell you.
[02:42:10.565 --> 02:42:16.369]  And then, you know, he never gets killed, but then his useful idiots go out and really do carry out bombings.
[02:42:17.749 --> 02:42:18.030]  Yeah.
[02:42:18.290 --> 02:42:19.811]  I mean, you've had cases in Britain.
[02:42:20.538 --> 02:42:28.480]  Where the so-called leader of the Al-Qaeda European network was protected in an MI5 safe house for years.
[02:42:28.500 --> 02:42:30.200]  He was never charged with anything.
[02:42:30.861 --> 02:42:49.245]  So, I mean, you've got the people being arrested in Britain, so-called terrorism being contacted by MI5 weeks before their so-called arrest, almost like they're patsies again being brought out to try and convince the British people that these people running around their back gardens
[02:42:50.636 --> 02:42:51.677]  Well, let me ask you a question.
[02:42:51.777 --> 02:43:02.862]  Why do you think they say they've captured Al Savare, what, four times, they've killed him once, and then they never discredit the last report, they never say we were wrong.
[02:43:03.222 --> 02:43:05.503]  No, they just capture or kill him again and again.
[02:43:06.324 --> 02:43:07.024]  Why do they do that?
[02:43:07.044 --> 02:43:09.445]  Why don't they change names or make more boogeymen?
[02:43:09.705 --> 02:43:13.347]  I mean, is it like an inside joke that people are so dumb they don't even notice that?
[02:43:14.568 --> 02:43:16.909]  Well, it could be an inside joke.
[02:43:17.149 --> 02:43:21.971]  It could be many different arms of the same intelligence bureaus playing games with each other.
[02:43:22.811 --> 02:43:27.893]  There was another report of al-Zaqawi being captured on Friday in Iraq.
[02:43:28.253 --> 02:43:35.715]  And so, if he has been captured, if he's still alive, I mean, we were told he was killed, what, back in 2002, MSNBC.
[02:43:36.295 --> 02:43:40.737]  Again, they'll use it as a set of... And they killed Chemical Ali twice.
[02:43:40.797 --> 02:43:41.977]  Now they say they've captured him.
[02:43:42.017 --> 02:43:43.938]  Are they going to prize Saddam's cousin?
[02:43:45.399 --> 02:43:45.899]  Well, exactly.
[02:43:45.919 --> 02:43:48.741]  And they showed us wax figurines of the Saddam sons.
[02:43:49.622 --> 02:43:50.922]  And said, wax figurines.
[02:43:51.883 --> 02:43:52.443]  What do you think?
[02:43:53.624 --> 02:43:56.526]  Well, I mean, I'm just waiting for Jasser Arafat to pop back up.
[02:43:56.566 --> 02:43:58.467]  It's gotten so crazy.
[02:43:58.547 --> 02:44:01.209]  And then they'll say he never died, and we never said he died.
[02:44:01.569 --> 02:44:04.051]  And that's the equivalent, yeah.
[02:44:04.071 --> 02:44:04.891]  Adolf Hitler, maybe.
[02:44:04.931 --> 02:44:05.371]  I don't know.
[02:44:06.632 --> 02:44:08.173]  Or Goldstein from 1984.
[02:44:08.253 --> 02:44:10.975]  I mean, the question is, why do they do that?
[02:44:11.415 --> 02:44:13.436]  I don't really... It doesn't make sense.
[02:44:13.737 --> 02:44:14.297]  Well, why do they...
[02:44:15.177 --> 02:44:20.500]  Well, maybe there are... We know with Saddam Hussein, he had at least, what, three, four look-alikes.
[02:44:21.120 --> 02:44:23.922]  Maybe they've created look-alikes for Al-Zaqawi as well.
[02:44:23.942 --> 02:44:27.464]  We had the fat Bin Laden, who's obviously not him again, another look-alike.
[02:44:27.924 --> 02:44:31.546]  So maybe they're just capturing look-alikes.
[02:44:31.606 --> 02:44:34.267]  Well, if that guy's a look-alike, then I'm a Bin Laden look-alike.
[02:44:35.128 --> 02:44:36.949]  Or you are.
[02:44:37.369 --> 02:44:38.730]  I look nothing like him.
[02:44:39.090 --> 02:44:40.631]  And they did the voiceprint and it wasn't him.
[02:44:41.537 --> 02:44:41.997]  Oh, boy.
[02:44:42.917 --> 02:44:45.018]  Paul, it just gets crazier and crazier.
[02:44:47.239 --> 02:44:48.439]  These people are lunatics.
[02:44:49.399 --> 02:44:50.440]  Total lunatics.
[02:44:51.560 --> 02:44:59.262]  Well, you have to remember that, what was it, Mark Twain, you know, if you don't tell a lie, you don't have to remember anything.
[02:44:59.623 --> 02:45:07.365]  So these people have lied so often that in the effect of covering up their own lies, they're tripping over themselves each time making mistakes.
[02:45:08.710 --> 02:45:14.493]  You know, things like Colin Powell saying that the Bin Laden video is on Al Jazeera, and then it pops up two hours later.
[02:45:15.334 --> 02:45:22.737]  I mean, if you lie so often, then you're going to make mistakes, and these people have made mistakes in public speeches and in actions over the course of the past four years.
[02:45:22.777 --> 02:45:31.281]  Yeah, Rumsfeld has said twice, he said twice they shot down Flight 93, then his head envoy, the former governor of Massachusetts, goes up to Canada and says they shot it down.
[02:45:33.692 --> 02:45:35.493]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:45:35.913 --> 02:45:37.194]  But no one calls it on him.
[02:45:37.234 --> 02:45:43.237]  I mean, Bush says this is a scripted press conference, and then the transcript says unscripted press conference.
[02:45:45.258 --> 02:45:47.819]  Well, I mean, they can't trust Bush with anything nowadays.
[02:45:47.859 --> 02:45:57.804]  I mean, he came out with the golden piece of hypocrisy where he said that Lebanon could never become a democracy or have freedom while foreign troops are stationed there.
[02:45:59.245 --> 02:45:59.985]  Iraq, anyone?
[02:46:01.164 --> 02:46:03.827]  Now let me ask you a question, Paul, and then I want to get into Princess Diana.
[02:46:04.688 --> 02:46:06.270]  We have just...
[02:46:07.188 --> 02:46:08.429]  Total open borders.
[02:46:08.629 --> 02:46:09.670]  Total amnesty.
[02:46:10.211 --> 02:46:13.934]  Massive gun control coming down from the Republicans.
[02:46:14.034 --> 02:46:15.315]  National ID cards.
[02:46:15.375 --> 02:46:17.937]  Pan-American Union ID cards.
[02:46:18.258 --> 02:46:19.779]  $2.6 trillion budgets.
[02:46:20.219 --> 02:46:21.961]  You know, dwarfing Bill Clinton's biggest.
[02:46:22.781 --> 02:46:24.343]  Just wild corruption.
[02:46:24.483 --> 02:46:29.787]  Wild Halliburton scamming that makes Martha Stewart look like an archangel.
[02:46:30.208 --> 02:46:32.410]  We've got all this going on...
[02:46:33.391 --> 02:46:37.457]  And still, I tune into Neocon Radio and there's no word of it.
[02:46:37.998 --> 02:46:44.568]  And I talk to so-called conservatives on the streets and they're the only people that literally drool and just go, I love Bush.
[02:46:46.178 --> 02:46:50.922]  Well, I mean, they've bought into the philosophy that the neocons practice their policy with.
[02:46:51.002 --> 02:46:54.324]  It's the Straussian philosophy, the noble lie.
[02:46:54.844 --> 02:46:58.647]  They can lie and lie and lie, and then it doesn't affect them.
[02:46:58.687 --> 02:47:05.953]  They can carry out the same policies with the same lies backing them up, but it's for this greater cause, so none of it matters.
[02:47:06.413 --> 02:47:11.597]  And the neocons, people on talk radio, have bought into that, so they go along with the same mindset.
[02:47:12.177 --> 02:47:16.719]  Which is why you'll still get people claiming that they found the weapons of mass destruction.
[02:47:16.759 --> 02:47:19.440]  Again, it's the noble lie to back up the greater cause.
[02:47:19.480 --> 02:47:22.642]  So, I mean, they're all part of the same power structure mentally.
[02:47:23.142 --> 02:47:26.183]  Or you'll hear them say that they never said there were WMDs.
[02:47:27.184 --> 02:47:28.044]  That's one of their favorites.
[02:47:28.084 --> 02:47:28.804]  We never said that.
[02:47:28.824 --> 02:47:29.865]  It was about elections.
[02:47:30.225 --> 02:47:31.265]  Well, no, you did say that.
[02:47:31.345 --> 02:47:31.946]  No, we didn't!
[02:47:32.106 --> 02:47:33.206]  Shut up, communists!
[02:47:35.027 --> 02:47:36.448]  I mean, they changed positions...
[02:47:38.434 --> 02:47:44.837]  Every day, basically, on every issue, the total opposite, to the point that people just get sick of it and tune off.
[02:47:45.838 --> 02:47:57.064]  That's mainly one of their strategies, is just to confuse people, bombard people with this garbage every day that people just turn off and go watch the football game because they can't keep up with it.
[02:47:59.224 --> 02:48:00.365]  Yeah, it's incredible.
[02:48:00.386 --> 02:48:04.991]  When we get back, I want to just briefly plug the new video and talk about Princess Diana.
[02:48:05.011 --> 02:48:06.973]  There's been a new development with Princess Diana.
[02:48:07.234 --> 02:48:09.056]  Go ahead and give us the front of it.
[02:48:10.017 --> 02:48:18.347]  Well, yeah, again, it's the media with their hot tip, which in every case acts as a diversion to focus people's attention away from the real smoking guns.
[02:48:19.753 --> 02:48:29.523]  And it's about how the cars were switched and that the car that she was supposed to be in wasn't used on the night, which I was on this show talking about in October 2003.
[02:48:30.364 --> 02:48:36.651]  So it's not really new news, but we can get into why the media is focusing on that and not focusing on the real issue.
[02:48:36.711 --> 02:48:41.416]  Well, I mean, Diana said, Charles told me he's going to kill me and it's going to be made to look like an auto accident.
[02:48:45.951 --> 02:48:50.278]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.478 --> 02:48:54.905]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:55.045 --> 02:48:59.431]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.471 --> 02:49:00.853]  The New World Order.
[02:49:02.596 --> 02:49:06.820]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.880 --> 02:49:13.808]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.948 --> 02:49:15.971]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.331 --> 02:49:26.756]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:26.937 --> 02:49:32.319]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:49:45.266 --> 02:49:53.530]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:49:53.790 --> 02:49:58.131]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.

[02:52:28.371 --> 02:52:31.876]  You know it as Skull and Bones, a worldwide criminal organization.

[02:53:21.588 --> 02:53:25.310]  Paul, real quick, I just want to take one call from Umar in Michigan, who's been holding forever.
[02:53:26.551 --> 02:53:28.452]  Tell us the latest developments with Princess Diana.
[02:53:29.252 --> 02:53:39.817]  Yeah, well, we have these memos surrounding the death of Diana being released after the British government got caught shredding thousands of documents before they had to release them.
[02:53:39.897 --> 02:53:50.201]  Here comes the astounding revelation that the original car in which Diana was supposed to be travelling in was switched and a substitute Mercedes was used instead, which we were talking about a year and a half ago.
[02:53:51.553 --> 02:54:02.719]  What they won't highlight, which is a key point, is that the second car was stolen a week prior to the crash and tampered with, according to the original investigation.
[02:54:03.319 --> 02:54:17.006]  A computer chip from the car was missing and the experts at the time said that the electronic system could have been replaced with a unit pre-programmed to automatically alter the car's acceleration and braking systems.
[02:54:17.706 --> 02:54:27.594]  Which dovetails with a 92 MI6 plot to assassinate Slobodan Milosevic where the car would be controlled by remote access and made to crash.
[02:54:28.194 --> 02:54:33.859]  So all the focus is on the first car when it's the second car, the crash car, that should be investigated.
[02:54:34.379 --> 02:54:46.589]  But of course that car... Then she was alive in the back of the car and they're leaning over her for an hour and the ambulance drives 30 miles an hour and she said Prince Charles told me he's going to kill me in a fake auto accident.
[02:54:47.089 --> 02:54:53.392]  Yeah, in order to clear the path for him to remarry Camilla Parker Bowles, which they made that announcement last month.
[02:54:53.412 --> 02:54:54.893]  All right, let's take a call.
[02:54:55.073 --> 02:54:56.414]  Umar in Michigan.
[02:54:56.454 --> 02:54:57.555]  Last caller, go ahead.
[02:54:58.635 --> 02:55:04.818]  Yeah, my question was actually for Detective Rothstein, but maybe you, of course, might know something about it.
[02:55:04.838 --> 02:55:13.123]  The satanic Atlanta child killer and how the whole nature of the investigation changed after George Bush Sr.
[02:55:14.283 --> 02:55:15.244]  got involved with it.
[02:55:16.360 --> 02:55:18.481]  I had heard about that, but I don't know the details.
[02:55:19.342 --> 02:55:19.882]  All right.
[02:55:20.303 --> 02:55:21.724]  Well, we tried to go to you earlier.
[02:55:22.964 --> 02:55:24.585]  You weren't there, so I'm sorry we didn't get you.
[02:55:25.066 --> 02:55:25.846]  Oh, that's okay.
[02:55:26.527 --> 02:55:27.227]  All right, Dan.
[02:55:27.327 --> 02:55:27.868]  Thanks a lot.
[02:55:28.168 --> 02:55:28.388]  All right.
[02:55:28.408 --> 02:55:30.069]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:55:30.389 --> 02:55:32.050]  Paul, you got the last 60 seconds.
[02:55:32.090 --> 02:55:32.991]  What else you got for us?
[02:55:34.452 --> 02:55:37.454]  Just the thing about the rock star Heathrow Airport.
[02:55:38.467 --> 02:55:44.513]  He was wearing a t-shirt with a graphic representation of a gun with a flame coming out the top of it.
[02:55:45.554 --> 02:55:47.315]  They said he was not allowed to fly.
[02:55:47.335 --> 02:55:49.477]  They said he was not allowed to wear that kind of thing.
[02:55:49.497 --> 02:55:57.624]  So now it's coming down to clothing is a sign of potential terrorist threat in airports.
[02:55:57.764 --> 02:55:58.805]  It's getting that bad.
[02:56:00.146 --> 02:56:01.067]  Well, it's symbols.
[02:56:01.147 --> 02:56:01.848]  It's words.
[02:56:01.988 --> 02:56:05.551]  It's people that write fiction articles about zombies.
[02:56:05.611 --> 02:56:06.912]  And we have to arrest you.
[02:56:06.932 --> 02:56:08.213]  You're a terrorist.
[02:56:08.253 --> 02:56:11.155]  You didn't list any names, but your life's over.
[02:56:11.296 --> 02:56:12.517]  It's a new freedom.
[02:56:13.497 --> 02:56:14.058]  Slavery.
[02:56:15.831 --> 02:56:17.593]  It's about what you think and not what you do.
[02:56:17.853 --> 02:56:19.075]  And it's about pre-crime.
[02:56:19.515 --> 02:56:21.378]  But it's about keeping the borders wide open, Paul.
[02:56:21.718 --> 02:56:22.218]  That's right.
[02:56:22.719 --> 02:56:24.201]  Alright, thanks for joining us, Paul Watson.
[02:56:24.521 --> 02:56:24.741]  Thanks.
[02:56:25.062 --> 02:56:27.324]  We'll see you over at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:56:27.725 --> 02:56:29.206]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:29.547 --> 02:56:31.169]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2 Central.
