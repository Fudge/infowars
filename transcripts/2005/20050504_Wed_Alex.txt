[00:00:05.982 --> 00:00:06.643]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.303 --> 00:00:08.344]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.065 --> 00:00:10.166]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.806 --> 00:00:11.667]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.387 --> 00:00:13.308]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.652]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.152 --> 00:00:22.296]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.385 --> 00:00:34.426]  Hello, my friends!
[00:00:36.187 --> 00:00:39.448]  It is Wednesday, the fourth day of May, 2005.
[00:00:39.528 --> 00:00:42.268]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:49.090]  We have a famous actor and also documentary filmmaker coming on in about 30 minutes, Tom Laughlin.
[00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:58.712]  And of course, in about an hour and a half, we've got David Ray Griffin joining us, who of course was on C-SPAN this weekend.
[00:00:59.212 --> 00:01:01.273]  An hour and a half presentation he gave of
[00:01:02.398 --> 00:01:03.818]  Well, the facts.
[00:01:04.458 --> 00:01:05.519]  The evidence is clear.
[00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:06.939]  The Globalists were behind 9-11.
[00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:19.882]  And they're going to be re-airing that, I've been told, on C-SPAN, a Saturday afternoon, I believe at 2.30 Eastern, 1.30 Central, this Saturday, because of overwhelming requests.
[00:01:19.902 --> 00:01:32.044]  So, David Ray Griffin, the author of The New Pearl Harbor and the 9-11 Commission Report, Omissions, and we'll be discussing his two books coming up in the middle of the broadcast today.
[00:01:33.777 --> 00:01:36.458]  In the meantime, there is just so much news to cover.
[00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:40.080]  I mean, where to start?
[00:01:40.541 --> 00:01:48.565]  I was touched by an article that Paul Watson wrote, and I was pleasantly surprised to see it this morning.
[00:01:49.605 --> 00:01:53.127]  The real origins of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[00:01:53.607 --> 00:01:58.790]  This needed to be said, and Paul has said it, and I'm touched by it.
[00:02:00.851 --> 00:02:02.872]  We'll discuss why it's important.
[00:02:04.187 --> 00:02:07.568]  Coming up in just a little while, of course, every day or two we see one of these.
[00:02:07.648 --> 00:02:09.689]  Phoenix man dies for being tasered.
[00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:18.012]  Listening microphones to be installed in an entire city to cut down on noise and people being too noisy.
[00:02:19.532 --> 00:02:23.534]  So now it's not to stop Al-Qaeda, it's to stop people talking too loud.
[00:02:23.554 --> 00:02:30.856]  And of course, the microphones have key computer software that listen for key words, and listen for decibels, and automatically dial up the police.
[00:02:31.596 --> 00:02:33.497]  And every home will be listened to.
[00:02:34.341 --> 00:02:36.823]  And this is what we'll all face very soon.
[00:02:36.983 --> 00:02:43.006]  Austin back in 1998 with the federal grant that Kay Bailey Hutchinson got us.
[00:02:43.026 --> 00:02:44.147]  $844,000 a year.
[00:02:44.187 --> 00:02:45.208]  It's in my film Police State 2000.
[00:02:45.268 --> 00:02:51.752]  Had microphones put up in a large portion of the city and since then they've been putting up more every year since then.
[00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:56.054]  Cisco slam for RFID staff tracker.
[00:02:57.035 --> 00:03:03.199]  Wireless RFID server tracks personnel via tags embedded in uniforms.
[00:03:05.023 --> 00:03:09.606]  Boston pays $5.1 million to dead Red Sox fans' family.
[00:03:09.626 --> 00:03:12.227]  Remember they murdered Mrs. Snellgrove.
[00:03:12.307 --> 00:03:14.648]  Bob Barr wants Patriot Act reigned in.
[00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:16.989]  You do that by getting rid of it.
[00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.431]  Public outrage kills L.A.
[00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:21.172]  Mexico sign saying that L.A.
[00:03:21.292 --> 00:03:22.012]  is Mexico.
[00:03:23.393 --> 00:03:26.555]  Congress to force agencies to identify video news feeds.
[00:03:27.015 --> 00:03:29.596]  These hundreds of millions of dollars of fake newscasts.
[00:03:30.437 --> 00:03:32.638]  Bush says he's not going to follow their order.
[00:03:34.804 --> 00:03:45.887]  Chicago's putting in these FEMA air raid sirens, but they're also going to be making New World Order announcements, and it's part of the EAS system that takes over all radio and TV stations.
[00:03:46.508 --> 00:03:51.489]  And they admit this here in this UPI article about what's happening in Chicago.
[00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:54.650]  Court rules IBM does not have to face Nazi charges.
[00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.070]  Reuters.
[00:03:56.251 --> 00:04:00.892]  Not because they didn't help the Nazis, but because the statute of limitations has run out.
[00:04:02.344 --> 00:04:06.206]  I didn't know there was a statute of limitations on murder, but according to them there is.
[00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:12.229]  Plainclothes troopers crash Shippensburg students' parties.
[00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:19.193]  They can't watch the border, but they can spy on student parties to make sure they're not drinking.
[00:04:20.194 --> 00:04:21.494]  Keeping us safe from Al-Qaeda.
[00:04:21.835 --> 00:04:22.935]  That's time well spent.
[00:04:23.055 --> 00:04:24.336]  Don't go after the meth labs.
[00:04:25.296 --> 00:04:26.677]  Go after the parties.
[00:04:26.717 --> 00:04:29.799]  That's, again, time well spent.
[00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:31.780]  That is just some.
[00:04:32.995 --> 00:04:33.675]  of what's coming up.
[00:04:33.695 --> 00:04:34.876]  There is so much news.
[00:04:35.416 --> 00:04:36.436]  We're going to cover it all.
[00:04:36.917 --> 00:04:39.638]  We've got two great guests today, thanks to my wonderful producer.
[00:04:40.738 --> 00:04:50.402]  The websites are Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and don't forget the great job Mr. Watson's brother is doing at Infowars.net.
[00:04:51.122 --> 00:04:54.564]  It's all coming up after this quick break, so be sure and stay with us.
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.762]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.962 --> 00:05:10.385]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.525 --> 00:05:14.908]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.948 --> 00:05:16.309]  The New World Order.
[00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:17.830]  Panama!
[00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:18.470]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:47.690]  We're good to go.
[00:06:02.515 --> 00:06:03.555]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:06:03.875 --> 00:06:06.656]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:06.936 --> 00:06:11.097]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:11.518 --> 00:06:12.338]  So what do you do?
[00:06:12.658 --> 00:06:17.259]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:19.800]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.241]  Sheltering in Place!
[00:06:21.642 --> 00:06:25.345]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.
[00:06:25.666 --> 00:06:35.035]  Developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[00:07:00.515 --> 00:07:03.897]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[00:07:04.137 --> 00:07:04.477]  Why?
[00:07:04.497 --> 00:07:07.438]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of Cardivite?
[00:07:07.518 --> 00:07:12.461]  Cardivite drops and capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.

[00:08:05.831 --> 00:08:06.472]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.132 --> 00:08:08.212]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.912 --> 00:08:10.033]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.673 --> 00:08:11.513]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.253 --> 00:08:13.774]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.814 --> 00:08:17.735]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.995 --> 00:08:22.076]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:35.899 --> 00:08:38.861]  Alright, second segment, 8 minutes, 35 seconds into this hour.
[00:08:38.901 --> 00:08:47.727]  David Ray Griffin, the professor, who was on C-SPAN last weekend, exposing government involvement in 9-11, will be joining us in the middle of the next hour.
[00:08:48.548 --> 00:09:01.137]  We also have Tom Laughlin, famous actor and documentary filmmaker, who is launching his own campaign to expose the NWO, will be joining us, scheduled to, here in about 30 minutes.
[00:09:03.132 --> 00:09:07.819]  I'm going to open the broadcast up with the real origins of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:15.511]  Then I will get into entire towns to have every home listened to by its own government-controlled microphone.
[00:09:16.878 --> 00:09:25.601]  Then I'll get into Cisco with embedded chips in their employees' clothing, tracking everything they do, everywhere they go.
[00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:32.383]  The murder of Mrs. Schnellgrove, Boston's had to pay out five plus million because the cop blew the young lady's head off.
[00:09:32.823 --> 00:09:35.604]  The fight over the Patriot Act is now coming to a head.
[00:09:36.144 --> 00:09:38.325]  There is so much coming up, so stay with us.
[00:09:38.385 --> 00:09:43.907]  But I was pleasantly surprised this morning, I guess you posted it last night,
[00:09:44.835 --> 00:10:12.319]  to read Paul Watson's analysis of who really founded the 9-11 truth movement and it's important to know that we're not tooting our horns that it is very important in history with any historical movement to have accurate history and to know who truly founded a movement because others
[00:10:13.297 --> 00:10:23.243]  can try to claim that they founded it and then you assert the moral authority as being founders to then claim that they control a movement.
[00:10:24.965 --> 00:10:27.806]  I have never said that I control the 9-11 truth movement.
[00:10:28.727 --> 00:10:35.932]  I have never attacked people's individual views on it who believe the government was involved or believe the government had prior knowledge.
[00:10:36.312 --> 00:10:42.636]  Though there is a wide spectrum of thought on exactly how the globalists carried the attacks out, we know they're guilty.
[00:10:44.272 --> 00:11:00.002]  The analogy I've used is the police pull over a murderer who's got skin under his fingernails and blood on his shirt and a scratch across his face and they open up the trunk and there's a dead woman in the back that he's raped and murdered.
[00:11:01.643 --> 00:11:11.929]  Now, he'll never admit to killing her, but we have witnesses that saw him drive into the woods, we have witnesses that heard screams, we have witnesses that
[00:11:13.084 --> 00:11:38.628]  uh... have told us that he said he was going to kill her while he even has a conviction for raping and killing another woman and so as police officers as detectives we may sit around in the water cooler room drinking coffee arguing about how we should carry out the prosecution what evidence we should bring forward to the DA and did he stab her before he raped her?
[00:11:39.649 --> 00:11:41.569]  details like that because he won't talk
[00:11:42.463 --> 00:11:45.987]  He won't give us the absolute final details.
[00:11:47.249 --> 00:11:48.651]  But we know he's a killer!
[00:11:49.632 --> 00:11:51.274]  We know they carried out 9-11.
[00:11:51.534 --> 00:11:52.716]  All the evidence shows it.
[00:11:53.737 --> 00:11:56.060]  The official government plans to carry out attacks.
[00:11:56.801 --> 00:11:58.062]  The history of it.
[00:11:58.462 --> 00:12:00.004]  The CIA insider trading.
[00:12:00.024 --> 00:12:01.605]  The public officials warned not to fly.
[00:12:01.645 --> 00:12:07.409]  The hijackers train at US military bases in their houses, cars, credit cards paid for by the US government.
[00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:12.713]  The embassies ordered to let them back into the country when they would leave the country for Al Qaeda summits.
[00:12:14.595 --> 00:12:19.178]  The heads of embassies told they're part of a secret anti-terrorism training program.
[00:12:20.059 --> 00:12:23.622]  On and on and on with literally 600 plus pieces of evidence.
[00:12:24.062 --> 00:12:24.943]  That's what we've compiled.
[00:12:25.794 --> 00:12:27.115]  So we know the globalists did it.
[00:12:27.135 --> 00:12:30.857]  We know they have the motive for a police state and oil and weapon sales.
[00:12:31.177 --> 00:12:34.339]  Even their own PNAC documents say they need terror attacks.
[00:12:34.599 --> 00:12:38.661]  Mick Cheney wrote that in September of 2000 before he was even in office.
[00:12:41.022 --> 00:12:43.704]  So we know they committed the atrocity.
[00:12:45.184 --> 00:12:46.265]  We understand that.
[00:12:46.365 --> 00:12:51.328]  But we can debate how they specifically carried it out.
[00:12:52.008 --> 00:12:53.489]  What happened in those woods?
[00:12:55.259 --> 00:12:56.199]  When they did the deed.
[00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:57.740]  You understand?
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:00.681]  But that hasn't happened.
[00:13:02.881 --> 00:13:03.741]  That hasn't happened.
[00:13:06.922 --> 00:13:10.563]  No, instead, Johnny Come Lately's and others have come along.
[00:13:11.424 --> 00:13:15.565]  They have claimed that they are the founders of the 9-11 Prift Movement and they have declared
[00:13:16.354 --> 00:13:31.440]  People authority, basically, to speak ex cathedra from the throne, literally, and tell us that they decide, and they arbitrate, and they tell us what can be debated, and what can be discussed, and what can be said.
[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:43.264]  And then, three years after I break news, three and a half years after I break stories, they then come out, and come out with the news, even years after the Associated Press has reported it,
[00:13:43.923 --> 00:13:48.587]  And say that they broke it, and then even attack me and say that it's their story!
[00:13:48.807 --> 00:13:49.748]  I mean, it's ridiculous!
[00:13:52.951 --> 00:13:54.412]  And it's very dangerous!
[00:13:56.854 --> 00:14:09.905]  And that's why a few months ago, I mentioned on air, that if you really got to have a founder, if you want to know who the founder of the 9-11 Truth Movement is, it's Alex Jones!
[00:14:11.986 --> 00:14:12.767]  It has to be done!
[00:14:14.358 --> 00:14:26.866]  I mean, it'd be like if I was there at the Continental Congress, and I was involved in writing something up, and then somebody came along 20 years later and said, no, no, no, I was there and I wrote it up, when it wasn't true!
[00:14:27.827 --> 00:14:29.968]  You see, it has to be responded to.
[00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:39.014]  Because I'm saying everybody should be able to debate this, and have discussions about this, and no one group is totally right.
[00:14:39.475 --> 00:14:41.496]  All of us together can defeat the New World Order.
[00:14:42.341 --> 00:14:46.344]  Well, Paul Watson has heard me talk about this, and so he decided to write up an article about it.
[00:14:46.364 --> 00:14:48.626]  Again, I was pleasantly surprised to see it posted this morning.
[00:14:48.986 --> 00:14:51.468]  The Real Origins of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[00:14:52.329 --> 00:15:00.114]  Four years ago, in May of 2001, I watched a British Channel 4 documentary about Alex Jones' infiltration into Bohemian Grove.
[00:15:00.595 --> 00:15:10.022]  At first glance, the show seemed to be a hit piece aimed at discrediting Alex and his work, but I wanted to make sure, so I visited Alex's website and started listening to his radio show.
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.641]  Alex was gripped with anguish and apprehension.
[00:15:14.102 --> 00:15:21.826]  He was talking about how the government were about to carry out an act of terrorism to bolster the construction of a police state and a New World Order.
[00:15:22.586 --> 00:15:29.950]  Alex dubbed his campaign, Expose the Government Terrorist, and urged his listeners to call the White House and tell them to call off the operation.
[00:15:31.071 --> 00:15:36.014]  He gave out White House switchboard numbers on his radio and television show on a daily basis.
[00:15:37.975 --> 00:15:39.496]  For two months, right up until 9-11.
[00:15:39.997 --> 00:15:46.743]  On his television show, Alex elaborated on the fact that the globalists were about to use their asset of some of Bin Laden to attack New York.
[00:15:46.903 --> 00:15:48.124]  Alex is not psychic.
[00:15:48.464 --> 00:15:49.605]  He does not have a crystal ball.
[00:15:49.665 --> 00:15:53.688]  He was able to make the call because he could see the conditioning in the media.
[00:15:53.949 --> 00:15:54.950]  Bin Laden is a threat.
[00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:55.890]  Bin Laden will attack.
[00:15:56.091 --> 00:15:58.152]  When Bin Laden attacks, give up your rights.
[00:15:59.654 --> 00:16:03.457]  This was an increasingly replayed
[00:16:04.244 --> 00:16:06.506]  mantra from the controlled media.
[00:16:06.546 --> 00:16:09.749]  You can click on a link and watch where I talk about it on the TV show.
[00:16:12.131 --> 00:16:16.174]  I watched all this develop before I even spoke to Alex or started my own website.
[00:16:18.997 --> 00:16:26.683]  On the day of the attack Alex called in the Derry Brownfield Show which was being broadcast on GCN before Alex's own show came on the air.
[00:16:27.284 --> 00:16:29.926]  Alex was adamant the government was behind the attack.
[00:16:30.667 --> 00:16:31.868]  They had been conditioned
[00:16:33.228 --> 00:16:38.091]  The public before the attack, and they had the most to gain from carrying out the attack.
[00:16:39.952 --> 00:16:53.040]  While others were squabbling over issues of prior knowledge, Alex was firm in pointing the finger directly at the criminals inside the military-industrial complex for being intimately involved in 9-11.
[00:16:54.201 --> 00:16:55.442]  And I got all the heat for that.
[00:16:55.462 --> 00:17:00.185]  When I said prior knowledge, I got attacked by people who later claimed they were founders of the 9-11 movement.
[00:17:00.876 --> 00:17:03.697]  When I said the government was involved, day one, I was attacked.
[00:17:04.537 --> 00:17:08.579]  The evidence is now overwhelming and clear that this is exactly what happened.
[00:17:08.959 --> 00:17:09.719]  They were behind it.
[00:17:10.179 --> 00:17:21.884]  In the days and weeks following 9-11, Alex was the first to draw attention to the crucial testimony of people like David Shippers and Greg Pallas, respectable figures blowing the whistle on government connections and protection of the terrorist.
[00:17:22.884 --> 00:17:28.506]  Greg Pallas thanked Alex for being the only radio host, we have a link to his public release that I never asked for,
[00:17:29.798 --> 00:17:39.929]  Greg Powell's thanked Alex for being the only radio host to pay attention to W199I, a leaked document concerning FBI protection of groups linked to Al-Qaeda.
[00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:45.915]  In mid to late 2004, several prominent, self-proclaimed 9-11 ringleaders started
[00:17:46.815 --> 00:17:51.697]  Talking about the fact that war games were used as a cover for the operational execution of the 9-11 attack.
[00:17:52.157 --> 00:17:56.538]  Alex was talking about this two years beforehand in his film, The Masters of Terror.
[00:17:56.799 --> 00:18:02.320]  We have a link to that, and again, an April 2004 television show, a clip of which can be viewed here.
[00:18:03.461 --> 00:18:15.025]  I point out these examples not to lionize Alex Jones and some kind of messiah, but in response to claims of many researchers that they are the grandfather of the 9-11 truth movement, or words to that effect.
[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:24.370]  It is disturbing to note that in many instances these same researchers have been seen to push obvious frauds like the peak oil theory.
[00:18:26.233 --> 00:18:33.842]  At least three years ago Alex warned people that the establishment would allow the truth about 9-11 to get out simply because it was too big a monster to hide.
[00:18:34.568 --> 00:18:45.636]  Alex pointed out, however, that the establishment would spin the issue to make people believe that the evil right-wing American Imperials were behind the terrorism, and so the only solution would be a left-wing world government to counter them.
[00:18:45.896 --> 00:18:46.776]  And now we're hearing that.
[00:18:47.577 --> 00:18:53.601]  So you would be forced to accept a false choice between right and left, a right-wing world government and a left-wing world government.
[00:18:54.081 --> 00:19:03.708]  Many prominent 9-11 researchers, either unwittingly or deliberately, have been promulgating this dangerous notion, stating that, for example, we need a global democracy
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.641]  to defeat the evil right-wing neocons.
[00:19:08.182 --> 00:19:14.765]  The fact that these individuals have been labeled the godfathers of the 9-11 movement is therefore a worrying development.
[00:19:15.145 --> 00:19:24.670]  This has given them the credibility required to create a 9-11 orthodoxy and marginalize anyone who discusses 9-11 issues they feel shouldn't be circulated.
[00:19:25.271 --> 00:19:29.873]  We vehemently disagree with and are highly suspicious of people who claim to be
[00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:41.233]  Who claim to be the bellwether 9-11 authority figures, especially when people like Alex Jones and others were way ahead of them on the curve on 9-11.
[00:19:41.714 --> 00:19:46.996]  The examples presented in this article underscore our conviction on the matter.
[00:19:49.176 --> 00:19:50.217]  It's very important.
[00:19:51.957 --> 00:20:01.341]  And, frankly, I took the heat, I hit the barbed wire first, I dealt with it, and then other people try to tell me what to do?
[00:20:02.051 --> 00:20:04.953]  Pope John Paul II is already being acclaimed a saint.
[00:20:05.074 --> 00:20:08.416]  During his 26 years, he canonized 482 saints.
[00:20:08.556 --> 00:20:10.618]  The one saint that stands out in my mind is St.
[00:20:10.658 --> 00:20:13.501]  Maria Faustina, a poor, uneducated Polish nun.
[00:20:13.641 --> 00:20:19.866]  Christ appeared to her over 100 times in the 1930s and instructed her to keep a diary of the message he wanted to give to the world.
[00:20:20.046 --> 00:20:23.469]  This message is nothing new, just a reminder of what the Church has always taught.
[00:20:23.729 --> 00:20:24.149]  I think so.
[00:20:48.286 --> 00:20:48.527]  We're good.
[00:21:01.184 --> 00:21:02.785]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:21:03.165 --> 00:21:08.887]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:21:09.167 --> 00:21:14.289]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:21:14.629 --> 00:21:23.932]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:21:24.273 --> 00:21:25.313]  It's rechargeable eight-lane
[00:21:25.633 --> 00:21:26.334]  I think so.
[00:21:45.129 --> 00:21:50.256]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and dial them Alex Jones sent you.

[00:22:01.275 --> 00:22:05.178]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:22:05.398 --> 00:22:17.688]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:22:18.108 --> 00:22:18.508]  The U.S.
[00:22:18.548 --> 00:22:24.133]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:22:24.533 --> 00:22:26.735]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:22:28.596 --> 00:22:29.657]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:22:29.697 --> 00:22:32.538]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:22:32.658 --> 00:22:38.681]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:22:39.101 --> 00:22:42.463]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[00:22:42.543 --> 00:22:48.886]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[00:22:49.447 --> 00:22:53.456]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[00:22:53.576 --> 00:22:53.917]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:53.937 --> 00:22:54.177]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:02.131]  Why do you wear watches?
[00:23:02.431 --> 00:23:05.013]  The answer is no longer simply to tell time.
[00:23:05.474 --> 00:23:13.040]  At DiscountWatchStore.com, watches are as much about telling time as they are about making a fashion statement or showing off one's success.
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:17.144]  Watches also make for great heirlooms to pass on for generations to come.
[00:23:17.624 --> 00:23:19.886]  As an authorized dealer of many fine watches,
[00:23:20.206 --> 00:23:26.692]  DiscountWatchStore.com offers fine timepieces that have been sought after by many for over 160 years.

[00:23:43.687 --> 00:23:45.888]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:23:45.948 --> 00:23:48.250]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:48.950]  And again, folks!
[00:24:13.229 --> 00:24:14.890]  It isn't that I want credit.
[00:24:15.731 --> 00:24:24.416]  Whenever the listeners call in and say, oh Alex, you're doing such a great job, oh Alex, you're so wonderful, I say, look, I'm just an average person fighting for my family's future.
[00:24:25.276 --> 00:24:29.559]  If my family's going to be safe and happy and have a future, I've got to stand up against this tyranny.
[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:31.300]  I'm just doing my duty.
[00:24:34.691 --> 00:24:45.114]  I do have an understanding of the New World Order that is not that plentiful on what you'd call the Truth Movement, or the Freedom Movement, or the Patriot Movement, or the Truth-Seeking Movement.
[00:24:46.255 --> 00:24:48.555]  I have the big picture.
[00:24:48.855 --> 00:24:53.297]  And perhaps it's because I literally... I did an 18-hour day again yesterday.
[00:24:53.357 --> 00:24:55.537]  I did a total of... I said I was going to do eight hours.
[00:24:55.597 --> 00:25:00.479]  I ended up doing nine and a half hours of broadcast yesterday.
[00:25:01.247 --> 00:25:04.348]  On all these different talk show interviews and my own broadcast.
[00:25:06.029 --> 00:25:08.810]  And I do that because I realize how serious this is.
[00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:13.712]  I know the globalists are kidnapping children and women right now and flying them to slave brothels.
[00:25:13.892 --> 00:25:16.813]  I know they're putting cancer viruses in vaccines right now.
[00:25:18.514 --> 00:25:18.614]  And
[00:25:19.668 --> 00:25:31.975]  When I get up here and tell you what they're going to do with the Patriot Act three years before they do it, when I tell you how they'll try to pass the national ID card and they do it, when I tell you how they're going to push the microchip, the implantable chip, it's because I understand them.
[00:25:32.495 --> 00:25:38.799]  It's like, you know, your grandpa who's been watching football for 50 years and he knows what play they're going to call before they call it.
[00:25:39.199 --> 00:25:41.640]  You know those type of football fans who you're amazed by.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:42.621]  It's like, are you psychic?
[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.280]  Well, no, I've been watching football for 50 years.
[00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:53.762]  Well, I've been studying the NWO for 12 years, been on air for 10 years, and I've done about 20, 30 years of work in the last 10 years.
[00:25:54.282 --> 00:25:55.683]  I've built up the experience.
[00:25:56.263 --> 00:25:57.683]  You know, like an experienced pilot.
[00:25:57.963 --> 00:26:00.123]  I've logged the tens of thousands of hours.
[00:26:01.124 --> 00:26:02.244]  I've watched the Globalists.
[00:26:02.264 --> 00:26:02.964]  I've studied them.
[00:26:03.004 --> 00:26:05.725]  I've read their policy reports until 3 a.m.
[00:26:06.045 --> 00:26:07.465]  so many nights, it's unbelievable.
[00:26:09.327 --> 00:26:14.349]  And I got up here on air and I pulled out all the stops for three hours one day.
[00:26:15.089 --> 00:26:16.449]  And I said, call the White House.
[00:26:16.529 --> 00:26:17.609]  They're going to blame Bin Laden.
[00:26:17.629 --> 00:26:18.570]  He's going to take the blame.
[00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:20.410]  They're going to attack the World Trade Center.
[00:26:21.431 --> 00:26:22.731]  I'm looking at the CDs of that.
[00:26:22.771 --> 00:26:24.151]  I had them burn my CDs years ago.
[00:26:24.451 --> 00:26:25.332]  I meant to air them on air.
[00:26:25.372 --> 00:26:28.213]  I never had time to give them to staff and have them grab all the clips out.
[00:26:28.233 --> 00:26:28.793]  But you know what?
[00:26:29.133 --> 00:26:30.053]  I've got the staff now.
[00:26:30.073 --> 00:26:30.673]  I've hired a few more.
[00:26:30.693 --> 00:26:31.654]  I need to dig those out.
[00:26:31.914 --> 00:26:33.074]  They're in a stack right over here.
[00:26:33.334 --> 00:26:34.114]  I need to play those.
[00:26:34.674 --> 00:26:36.635]  Much more powerful than the TV show where I did it.
[00:26:37.389 --> 00:26:38.990]  Where I said, this is probably what's going to happen.
[00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:41.471]  He's been lied to, attacked the World Trade Center, he'll take the blame.
[00:26:43.052 --> 00:26:43.812]  How did I know that?
[00:26:44.272 --> 00:26:46.013]  I had sources, but not just sources.
[00:26:46.053 --> 00:26:47.133]  It was my understanding.
[00:26:47.994 --> 00:26:50.655]  And it was hard to go on air and say that before 9-11.
[00:26:50.675 --> 00:26:52.116]  It was hard to do it on the morning of 9-11.
[00:26:52.176 --> 00:26:54.837]  It was hard.
[00:26:54.897 --> 00:26:56.578]  I mean, Gary Brownfield invited me on.
[00:26:56.598 --> 00:26:58.659]  He said, Gary's a great guy.
[00:26:59.599 --> 00:27:03.321]  And then after that happened, he got so much heat, he told me, sorry Alex, you're banned from the show.
[00:27:04.415 --> 00:27:06.416]  I got his email from his producer.
[00:27:06.436 --> 00:27:15.420]  He said, we know you're right, but we lost stations today, and we can't ever have you on the show again.
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:20.442]  And of course, I lost stations, but later got those stations back and got even more stations.
[00:27:24.304 --> 00:27:26.805]  I got death threats over it.
[00:27:27.005 --> 00:27:28.926]  I laid out what they would then do.
[00:27:29.961 --> 00:27:31.601]  And they're going to carry out more attacks, folks.
[00:27:31.861 --> 00:27:36.162]  Because you've stood up and exposed 9-11, we've already backed off their attacks.
[00:27:36.202 --> 00:27:37.282]  They would have already happened.
[00:27:37.322 --> 00:27:37.822]  Bigger ones.
[00:27:40.843 --> 00:27:42.343]  And so I do have credibility.
[00:27:43.383 --> 00:27:49.104]  I'm sorry I get upset sometimes and that delivery style might not be palatable to some, but this is heavy information.
[00:27:49.144 --> 00:27:49.845]  This is painful.
[00:27:51.325 --> 00:27:55.065]  And this is the reality of what we face.
[00:27:59.235 --> 00:28:11.463]  Then it's very sad to watch individuals come out of the woodwork who try to limit the scope of the 9-11 investigation and to watch them declare themselves the grandfathers and godfathers and fathers.
[00:28:11.723 --> 00:28:12.464]  There's a bunch of them.
[00:28:13.344 --> 00:28:19.688]  People, in some cases, even attacked me early on and said that I was wrong, that the government was involved.
[00:28:19.768 --> 00:28:23.691]  They now say that and then claim information that we broke.
[00:28:26.627 --> 00:28:28.568]  And so that's why I've spent some time on this today.
[00:28:28.969 --> 00:28:33.812]  So I hope you'll go to PrisonPlanet.com and go down to the right hand side of the first news column.
[00:28:35.033 --> 00:28:37.435]  The headline is, The Real Origins of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[00:28:37.455 --> 00:28:38.896]  I hope you'll email this out to people.
[00:28:40.017 --> 00:28:46.421]  So when they hear somebody announcing that they're the grandfather of the 9-11 Truth Movement, they'll investigate that individual.
[00:28:46.902 --> 00:28:48.303]  They'll investigate those individuals.
[00:28:49.383 --> 00:28:52.906]  Because I never wanted to claim this mantle, though it is mine.
[00:28:54.264 --> 00:28:55.364]  I personally don't care.
[00:28:55.464 --> 00:28:56.065]  I didn't care.
[00:28:56.405 --> 00:29:01.006]  But I didn't realize, I didn't think about it, how important it is to be able to claim that.
[00:29:01.246 --> 00:29:04.747]  Because then they claim almost, as I said, papal authority.
[00:29:06.007 --> 00:29:15.210]  It's the same analogy that, you know, I have this position, and I'm the one that first broke this, and so I'm the one that tells you who you can believe and who you can listen to.
[00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:16.470]  That's what they're doing.
[00:29:17.191 --> 00:29:18.491]  As the father of the 9-11 movement,
[00:29:20.598 --> 00:29:22.759]  I'm saying you're all more important than I am.
[00:29:23.059 --> 00:29:24.299]  You're smarter than I am.
[00:29:24.799 --> 00:29:25.780]  You should be leaders.
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.880]  I'll support you if you're doing good work.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.741]  I'll have you on this radio show.
[00:29:30.961 --> 00:29:33.522]  But if you're a backstabbing viper, I won't!
[00:29:35.963 --> 00:29:38.103]  So, that's why I have to do this.
[00:29:40.004 --> 00:29:40.504]  It's important.
[00:29:41.585 --> 00:29:48.407]  You know, it'd be like if I was the first person to fly across the Atlantic Ocean in a one-engine plane and then somebody else took credit for it.
[00:29:48.467 --> 00:29:49.447]  You'd be mad, wouldn't you?
[00:29:51.952 --> 00:29:54.994]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.014 --> 00:29:58.675]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:04.058 --> 00:30:09.541]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:30:09.961 --> 00:30:14.183]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:30:14.423 --> 00:30:21.427]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:30:21.827 --> 00:30:27.931]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:30:28.071 --> 00:30:29.332]  There are no side effects.
[00:30:29.632 --> 00:30:32.594]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:30:32.734 --> 00:30:34.796]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:30:35.076 --> 00:30:42.320]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:30:42.621 --> 00:30:45.983]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[00:30:46.423 --> 00:30:51.085]  For more information call Alternative Technologies toll free 866-885-6625 866-885-6625 One more time that's 866-885-6625 call today!
[00:31:01.391 --> 00:31:03.352]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[00:31:03.452 --> 00:31:14.157]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:14.537 --> 00:31:19.059]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:19.119 --> 00:31:30.465]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:31.045 --> 00:31:37.914]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:31:38.294 --> 00:31:40.437]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:31:40.938 --> 00:31:45.904]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post-filter elements.
[00:31:46.204 --> 00:31:52.486]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:52.566 --> 00:31:56.767]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:31:56.987 --> 00:31:57.907]  That's toll free.
[00:31:57.927 --> 00:31:59.848]  888-803-4438.
[00:32:00.288 --> 00:32:08.250]  For some time now, many people have heard of the benefits of Oregasin, Oreganol, OregaMax, and the many other health products from North American Urban Spice.
[00:32:08.611 --> 00:32:09.811]  Dr. Cass Ingram has stated,
[00:32:10.271 --> 00:32:20.877]  Extracts of wild oregano, notably the P-7-3 oil and particularly the P-7-3 oregason, completely obliterate the human cold virus in 20 minutes in one dose with a 100% kill.
[00:32:21.177 --> 00:32:26.000]  Health and well-being can be achieved by using the all-natural urban spice products from North American Urban Spice.

[00:32:30.702 --> 00:32:39.467]  The oils, juices, and capsules manufactured by North American Urban Spice are from the finest raw materials in the world, which is why North American Urban Spice is recognized as the leader in natural herbal products.
[00:32:39.907 --> 00:32:44.392]  The herbal medicine has the exact frequency, the exact chemistry to kill any germ.

[00:32:46.013 --> 00:32:47.275]  Herbs and spices or doctors and drugs.
[00:32:47.295 --> 00:32:47.935]  The choice is yours.
[00:32:47.975 --> 00:32:49.877]  Call 877-817-9829 to order your North American Herb and Spice products today.
[00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:08.401]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:08.881 --> 00:33:11.703]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:13.263 --> 00:33:19.406]  Famous actor and documentary filmmaker Tom Laughlin will be joining us for 30 minutes of the next hour.
[00:33:19.926 --> 00:33:25.389]  He's getting involved in a movement against the NWO and making a new documentary, a new film about it.
[00:33:26.029 --> 00:33:35.454]  And then 30 minutes into the next hour, for a full hour, we're going to have David Ray Griffin, the professor who's been exposed to government prior knowledge and involvement in 9-11, joining us as well.
[00:33:36.207 --> 00:33:46.034]  Another great 9-11 researcher, who isn't involved in backstabbing and attacking other researchers, who's just involved in getting the truth out, will be joining us.
[00:33:46.054 --> 00:33:46.534]  That's what we do.
[00:33:46.574 --> 00:33:56.221]  We hold up the real researchers, the people that care, the people that are taking action, and he'll be joining us coming up as well.
[00:33:56.961 --> 00:33:59.783]  I'm going to go to Richard and Charles and others in the news here in a moment.
[00:34:00.044 --> 00:34:03.486]  Just my final comments about the 9-11 truth movement.
[00:34:04.961 --> 00:34:12.365]  Is that we've seen multiple salt-described leaders and founders of the 9-11 Truth Movement who have no claim to that mantle.
[00:34:14.106 --> 00:34:16.167]  Which is a dangerous mantle, I would add, by the way.
[00:34:16.187 --> 00:34:23.651]  It's like John Hancock signing his name big and fat on the Declaration of Independence.
[00:34:23.731 --> 00:34:25.232]  I mean, it's really asking for it.
[00:34:26.593 --> 00:34:28.414]  It's not in particularly a mantle I want.
[00:34:28.894 --> 00:34:30.215]  I just want to defeat the New World Order.
[00:34:30.235 --> 00:34:31.055]  That's what I care about.
[00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:35.893]  But some of these same individuals then tell us, 9-11 Truth Movement, dead.
[00:34:36.313 --> 00:34:37.934]  Go home, go to sleep, it's over.
[00:34:38.354 --> 00:34:39.415]  Move on to something else.
[00:34:40.416 --> 00:34:48.021]  When we're on the verge of it becoming mainstream, and major polls show the majority of Americans think like we do.
[00:34:48.041 --> 00:34:53.265]  I mean, right when we're winning the battle, suddenly, okay, lay down!
[00:34:55.726 --> 00:34:57.468]  Very Benedict Arnold-like.
[00:34:59.133 --> 00:35:00.934]  And of great concern.
[00:35:00.994 --> 00:35:05.695]  So that's why I've got to get up on air and lay my cards on the table.
[00:35:06.515 --> 00:35:07.196]  It's ridiculous.
[00:35:07.216 --> 00:35:09.516]  A lot of people thought, Alex is a loose cannon.
[00:35:09.536 --> 00:35:10.457]  He's shooting his mouth off.
[00:35:10.717 --> 00:35:16.698]  This guy goes on the air at 10 o'clock in the morning on 9-11.
[00:35:20.242 --> 00:35:21.043]  Well, that's not even true.
[00:35:21.083 --> 00:35:24.124]  I was calling in David Joyce that day, right after it happened.
[00:35:24.405 --> 00:35:27.387]  But there on Derry-Brownfield for, you know, 30 minutes laying it out.
[00:35:27.747 --> 00:35:29.068]  Now this guy, he's a loose cannon.
[00:35:29.088 --> 00:35:31.089]  He's on the air saying, Operation Northwood U.S.
[00:35:31.129 --> 00:35:36.472]  Government Plan, because that's in the plan to hijack jets, promote control, crash them and blame it on foreign enemies.
[00:35:37.153 --> 00:35:39.154]  And man, this guy, you know, where does he come up with all this?
[00:35:39.554 --> 00:35:45.258]  I've been saying it for two months when I could really see from all the different indicators that they were going to do this.
[00:35:47.122 --> 00:35:50.663]  And I've really got to thank the ADL for demonizing me that night.
[00:35:51.604 --> 00:35:55.365]  They put out a report attacking me, going, look at Alex Jones!
[00:35:56.125 --> 00:35:58.646]  You know, within hours of it, he's blaming the government.
[00:35:58.666 --> 00:36:02.848]  And you go read the quotes I gave that they put on their website.
[00:36:03.948 --> 00:36:04.569]  Still there.
[00:36:04.589 --> 00:36:12.772]  I mean, I've got the opposition, the establishment demonization arm, who just goes out demonizing good people and mixing them in with bad.
[00:36:13.992 --> 00:36:16.413]  I've got them basically documenting for the record.
[00:36:17.418 --> 00:36:20.400]  A week later, the Washington Post SAVAGED me!
[00:36:22.262 --> 00:36:23.903]  This Alex Jones!
[00:36:23.943 --> 00:36:33.912]  You can even go to the Alex Jones section for my bio on InfoWars.com, and in there, one of the articles that's listed is an article out of the Washington Post, and they got me in there!
[00:36:33.952 --> 00:36:37.936]  Alex Jones thinks the government was involved as a pretext to invade countries!
[00:36:38.316 --> 00:36:40.618]  Alex Jones thinks the government was in control!
[00:36:40.698 --> 00:36:42.380]  Alex Jones is crazy!
[00:36:44.184 --> 00:36:47.427]  I mean, imagine taking the heat, being the first to hit the barbed wire.
[00:36:48.648 --> 00:36:51.650]  To literally hit the barbed wire so everybody else could run over my back.
[00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:58.295]  And then to have the people that ran over my back after I took the machine gun nest, turn around and say I'm bad.
[00:36:59.416 --> 00:37:04.680]  And turn around and after we've almost taken the hill, tell everybody turn around and go home.
[00:37:06.161 --> 00:37:06.441]  No!
[00:37:06.601 --> 00:37:06.902]  Never!
[00:37:08.523 --> 00:37:10.585]  I've taken a lot of shots going up this hill.
[00:37:11.485 --> 00:37:12.326]  And I'm not going to let
[00:37:14.537 --> 00:37:17.740]  Individuals out there stop what we're doing.
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:19.902]  We're going to go all the way to the end.
[00:37:19.962 --> 00:37:21.603]  We're never going to stop.
[00:37:22.084 --> 00:37:23.505]  We're never going to surrender.
[00:37:23.725 --> 00:37:25.086]  We're never going to give in.
[00:37:25.326 --> 00:37:26.768]  We're never going to give up.
[00:37:28.989 --> 00:37:35.055]  I mean, it's satisfying to go from being a pariah to
[00:37:36.209 --> 00:37:39.931]  Everything I talked about now being with the general public on the street.
[00:37:39.971 --> 00:37:44.452]  Talk to them something that they believe and they've heard and they know.
[00:37:44.492 --> 00:37:45.753]  They just don't have all the details.
[00:37:45.813 --> 00:37:47.314]  Now it's our job to give them the details.
[00:37:48.774 --> 00:37:56.777]  So again, I ask you to go to PrisonPlanet.com and get this article, The Real Origins of the 9-11 Truth Movement, and to email it out to everybody.
[00:37:59.338 --> 00:38:02.840]  And there were other people, by the way, that were focusing on government-sponsored terror.
[00:38:03.533 --> 00:38:20.681]  And that we're warning people what really happened was, Jeff Rents was, uh... Oh, there's so many that we could call the founding fathers and mothers of exposing government-sponsored terrorism, but I was obsessed with it.
[00:38:20.861 --> 00:38:21.682]  I was haranguing it.
[00:38:21.842 --> 00:38:23.342]  I was detailing it.
[00:38:23.482 --> 00:38:28.665]  I was laying it out with specifics because
[00:38:29.838 --> 00:38:30.599]  I guess it's a blessing.
[00:38:30.619 --> 00:38:31.679]  Sometimes it feels like a curse.
[00:38:32.119 --> 00:38:33.740]  I understand how they operate.
[00:38:33.841 --> 00:38:34.861]  I know their program.
[00:38:38.003 --> 00:38:43.026]  But there were a lot of people that had the government-sponsored terror sections that were concerned about it.
[00:38:43.066 --> 00:38:45.368]  I mean, Oklahoma City, World Trade Center, first bombing.
[00:38:45.708 --> 00:38:49.630]  That's why we were already talking about government-sponsored terror, because we had all these other examples of it!
[00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:50.311]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:38:53.072 --> 00:38:54.453]  It's just, it's too rich.
[00:38:54.593 --> 00:38:55.354]  It's too much.
[00:38:56.696 --> 00:39:02.337]  To watch people claim they're the founders, or have people claim it for them, and there's a bunch of them doing this.
[00:39:03.017 --> 00:39:09.039]  And then to watch them run around and tell us that we've jumped on their bandwagon and that we're a bunch of scallywags.
[00:39:11.459 --> 00:39:13.720]  It isn't about who's the first.
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:19.581]  But we have to talk about it because people will claim that mantle and that authority.
[00:39:20.921 --> 00:39:22.182]  Well, I don't have to claim it.
[00:39:22.322 --> 00:39:23.142]  It's mine.
[00:39:25.723 --> 00:39:33.408]  It's my John Hancock on my head, my treasure, my family, my future, my life, my blood, my sweat, my tears!
[00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:37.511]  It's my millstone!
[00:39:40.653 --> 00:39:44.796]  And... Oh, it's just incredible.
[00:39:46.217 --> 00:39:47.698]  It's absolutely amazing.
[00:39:48.519 --> 00:39:53.202]  And I've just been thinking about it the last few months, mulling it over and watching all this happen.
[00:39:57.401 --> 00:39:58.262]  Who's up first here?
[00:40:00.964 --> 00:40:02.825]  Richard in Florida, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[00:40:02.965 --> 00:40:04.627]  Yes, keep up the good work.
[00:40:04.687 --> 00:40:07.109]  I was wondering, you didn't mention Ruby Ridge.
[00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:16.416]  I think that's despicable what happened, that Agent Horiuchi fired through the building and killed, didn't know who he was shooting at, just fired through the building.
[00:40:16.436 --> 00:40:17.337]  Well, that's his story.
[00:40:17.397 --> 00:40:21.740]  Actually, in his testimony, he wanted to shoot the corner at a couple hundred yards, and
[00:40:24.577 --> 00:40:31.321]  Mickey Weaver was on the porch with a baby in her arms that was breastfeeding and he blew her head off and chunks of her skull went into the baby.
[00:40:31.902 --> 00:40:34.083]  Oh, I understood she was in the house and he fired through the wall.
[00:40:35.284 --> 00:40:39.667]  No, she was out the front door and he fired through the glass on the door.
[00:40:40.488 --> 00:40:44.870]  So, what's the solution to this junta we have in Washington?
[00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:46.111]  What do we do?
[00:40:46.171 --> 00:40:47.032]  Junta's a good word.
[00:40:47.072 --> 00:40:48.793]  Why don't you tell folks first what a junta is?
[00:40:49.914 --> 00:40:52.876]  Well, that's like a dictatorship that's
[00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:57.122]  Basically, it's a dictatorship, and that's what we're living under.
[00:40:57.142 --> 00:40:58.503]  A dictatorship of a crew.
[00:40:58.583 --> 00:41:00.525]  It's not a single dictator.
[00:41:00.765 --> 00:41:02.566]  It's a gang, a nest.
[00:41:02.766 --> 00:41:05.708]  Well, you start with the head, and then it works out from there.
[00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:09.151]  All their subsidiaries feeding on people.
[00:41:09.191 --> 00:41:10.532]  The Nazis were a junta.
[00:41:10.812 --> 00:41:12.373]  Like Halliburton Oil, for instance.
[00:41:12.513 --> 00:41:15.415]  I mean, this is outrageous, what's going on and what we're doing.
[00:41:15.435 --> 00:41:18.738]  I talk to people about this social security thing.
[00:41:18.798 --> 00:41:23.401]  People are concerned about it, and what we need to do is go after these congressmen
[00:41:25.225 --> 00:41:35.253]  Well, it's like a gambler, and they're the casino.
[00:41:35.293 --> 00:41:40.918]  They set up a system, get us hooked on it, gotta have it, because now they control the economy.
[00:41:41.764 --> 00:41:54.790]  They set it up so we're dependent, where you can't get the good jobs in many cases, and even people who've worked and paid in their whole lives, they're saying, okay, we spent all the money in it, and so now we've got to give it over to the corporations, who I don't trust either, it's all the same group!
[00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:58.872]  Well, and it's not we the corporations, it's supposed to be we the people.
[00:41:59.472 --> 00:42:00.573]  We need to get back to that.
[00:42:00.633 --> 00:42:07.036]  We need to go to public financing for elections, stop the PIC, stop the PAC, stop the hard money, stop the soft money.
[00:42:08.559 --> 00:42:10.080]  But we've got to get into the details.
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:12.800]  They told us campaign finance reform would stop corporations.
[00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:16.521]  It doubled the money they could give and restricted the money you and I can give.
[00:42:16.561 --> 00:42:17.202]  Oh, exactly.
[00:42:17.242 --> 00:42:17.982]  That's the whole deal.
[00:42:18.062 --> 00:42:19.202]  Everything's up is down.
[00:42:19.242 --> 00:42:23.003]  They give you a national ID card, say it's to stop illegals.
[00:42:23.343 --> 00:42:26.324]  Actually helps the illegals, but people believe the propaganda.
[00:42:26.344 --> 00:42:27.764]  I mean, it's always the opposite.
[00:42:27.904 --> 00:42:31.605]  Well, if we really wanted to stop the illegals, we'd secure the southern border.
[00:42:31.625 --> 00:42:34.166]  I mean, what is going on in this country?
[00:42:34.747 --> 00:42:37.928]  Why aren't... and nobody's admitting that they're Republicans anymore!
[00:42:38.608 --> 00:42:45.170]  They've put up over 700 microphones that we know of in Austin, Texas, listening to the public, but they won't put them up on the border.
[00:42:47.211 --> 00:42:47.491]  Sad.
[00:42:48.131 --> 00:42:48.591]  So sad.
[00:42:48.711 --> 00:42:49.312]  Thanks for the call.
[00:42:49.332 --> 00:42:49.852]  Great points.
[00:42:50.192 --> 00:42:51.472]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:42:51.792 --> 00:42:52.913]  Charles in Pennsylvania.
[00:42:52.933 --> 00:42:53.673]  Go ahead, Charles.
[00:42:54.973 --> 00:42:57.574]  I was listening to O'Reilly.
[00:42:57.594 --> 00:43:00.315]  That's what caused me to give you a call.
[00:43:01.094 --> 00:43:02.955]  I wanted to make a comment about the ADL.
[00:43:02.995 --> 00:43:03.735]  You mentioned it.
[00:43:03.855 --> 00:43:06.317]  Did they put you on their website?
[00:43:07.697 --> 00:43:09.018]  Yeah, they've done it several times.
[00:43:09.678 --> 00:43:12.840]  Well, there's a book called The Other Side of Deception.
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:16.681]  It's by a former Mossad agent named Victor Atrofsky.
[00:43:17.522 --> 00:43:21.323]  And in that book, now this isn't Charlie saying this, this is Victor Atrofsky.
[00:43:22.104 --> 00:43:26.546]  The ADL is an arm of the Mossad.
[00:43:27.313 --> 00:43:34.859]  Well, the LAPD, and it also happened in San Francisco, raided them and found all the files.
[00:43:35.379 --> 00:43:38.061]  Of course, it is Mossad.
[00:43:38.081 --> 00:43:41.764]  It isn't an arm, it is Mossad.
[00:43:43.365 --> 00:43:53.893]  It's so incredible that these people are here operating in our country and giving advice to our own intelligence agency against their own citizens.
[00:43:54.374 --> 00:43:56.015]  They have been taken over by foreigners.
[00:43:56.550 --> 00:44:04.198]  What I wanted to ask you about, and we've talked about this before, about the minions on these talk shows, like Mr. O'Reilly.
[00:44:07.021 --> 00:44:12.507]  It's just unbelievable to me that they all have this same story about this 5 year old that they've handcuffed.
[00:44:12.587 --> 00:44:13.708]  I don't know if you've noticed that.
[00:44:13.828 --> 00:44:14.769]  It's so sickening.
[00:44:17.307 --> 00:44:22.548]  They're talking about the five-year-old Michael Jackson or this runaway bride.
[00:44:22.568 --> 00:44:27.410]  And the five-year-old is important, but not the runaway bride or Michael Jackson.
[00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:33.252]  Yeah, that Michael Jackson thing, we should be able to sue him too, just to have to listen to that garbage.
[00:44:33.312 --> 00:44:42.215]  But anyway, for them to... People with actual some intelligence, stating that it's okay
[00:44:42.805 --> 00:44:45.767]  Have handcuffed a five-year-old child.
[00:44:46.007 --> 00:44:47.287]  Have the police come in.
[00:44:47.668 --> 00:44:49.949]  I mean, what is it really going to take?
[00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:50.990]  Three police.
[00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:51.830]  Three police.
[00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:56.132]  And no one asks, why was there a camera there to begin with?
[00:44:56.172 --> 00:45:03.716]  See, we just organically, like it's part of our environment now, don't ask ourselves, why was there a camera in that first grade class?
[00:45:04.997 --> 00:45:05.437]  Yeah, that's...
[00:45:07.168 --> 00:45:11.891]  You automatically, and what you're saying is probably 10% of what really helped.
[00:45:11.911 --> 00:45:19.397]  This stuff cannot possibly... Sir, from England to the U.S., every city is going to have a microphone pointed at every house.
[00:45:19.917 --> 00:45:21.839]  This is the official federal plan.
[00:45:22.719 --> 00:45:25.041]  That's 1984, my friend!
[00:45:25.161 --> 00:45:29.944]  In yesterday's paper, they have the Secret Service in the Federal Building in Pittsburgh.
[00:45:30.365 --> 00:45:32.266]  They have a two-page article about it.
[00:45:32.694 --> 00:45:36.195]  Where they're monitoring people's computers and their emails.
[00:45:36.475 --> 00:45:38.916]  Like, you know, like this is the thing to do!
[00:45:39.496 --> 00:45:40.937]  And there's no response.
[00:45:41.157 --> 00:45:44.838]  Nobody seems to even... No discussion of a Fourth Amendment?
[00:45:44.898 --> 00:45:45.318]  No nothing?
[00:45:45.398 --> 00:45:48.059]  It's an absolute... Why don't they just call them the secret police?
[00:45:48.079 --> 00:45:49.479]  Why don't they call them the Stasi?
[00:45:49.519 --> 00:45:52.580]  Okay, we're watching the bourgeoisie and the lumpen.
[00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:55.221]  Well, they're doing... And thank you Charles, great point.
[00:45:55.241 --> 00:45:57.081]  Can I ask what... Go ahead.
[00:45:58.602 --> 00:45:58.862]  Go ahead.
[00:45:59.851 --> 00:46:16.286]  I just wanted to tell you this other thing about, they took 400 children up in New York City, these foster children, and they put them into an HIV study without notifying their parents, not even notifying their foster parents.
[00:46:16.306 --> 00:46:21.711]  With a very dangerous experimental chemical that killed some of them, thanks for the call.
[00:46:22.312 --> 00:46:24.794]  And again, that's what you hear about in our media.
[00:46:25.456 --> 00:46:31.798]  If you read the BBC and you read a few of the local New York papers, it never makes it out nationally, it's over 400.
[00:46:32.038 --> 00:46:32.798]  That was one study.
[00:46:34.038 --> 00:46:36.879]  If the foster parents refused to do it, they took them, took their check.
[00:46:37.619 --> 00:46:40.900]  If the CPS workers refused, which some did have a conscience, they were fired.
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:45.381]  But sir, hundreds of those children didn't even have HIV.
[00:46:47.342 --> 00:46:51.643]  And this was a poisonous chemical that they wouldn't even give people who were dying of AIDS.
[00:46:53.453 --> 00:46:59.056]  But, sir, type in, foster children, pesticides tested on foster children.
[00:46:59.837 --> 00:47:01.418]  They killed children in New York.
[00:47:01.598 --> 00:47:02.238]  Killed them!
[00:47:03.219 --> 00:47:04.960]  By making them drink pesticides.
[00:47:07.081 --> 00:47:08.042]  So that's your government.
[00:47:08.062 --> 00:47:13.045]  I mean, I was on Jeff Ritt's program last night, I was talking to him, and we brought up DU.
[00:47:14.266 --> 00:47:21.530]  The Army's own reports say that if you ingest it, it will kill you and then it causes deformities.
[00:47:22.531 --> 00:47:22.951]  Our troops
[00:47:23.917 --> 00:47:29.020]  Children had tripled the deformities of the general public after the first Gulf War.
[00:47:29.561 --> 00:47:35.965]  And speaking of triple, they used at least three times as much DU this go-around and this time in Big Six.
[00:47:38.066 --> 00:47:42.949]  Now every year in Texas we get hit by this red dust and they tell us that it came from Central Asia.
[00:47:44.770 --> 00:47:45.731]  And it blows across.
[00:47:47.832 --> 00:47:52.815]  It starts blowing in Saudi Arabia, moves across Iran, Afghanistan,
[00:47:53.542 --> 00:48:00.384]  And blows and this thick red dust gets on our vehicles and they say on the news that it's from Mongolia and from Afghanistan.
[00:48:02.085 --> 00:48:06.786]  The Earth's air recycles every 48 hours.
[00:48:07.366 --> 00:48:08.366]  It goes into the rain.
[00:48:09.207 --> 00:48:13.668]  They admit levels of DU are being picked up in water tables across the U.S.
[00:48:13.688 --> 00:48:17.789]  Did you know they tested and used tons of DU off the coast?
[00:48:18.689 --> 00:48:20.630]  This is admitted on an island
[00:48:21.417 --> 00:48:27.620]  That is less than a half mile away from a major city in Puerto Rico?
[00:48:30.582 --> 00:48:30.902]  Folks!
[00:48:31.742 --> 00:48:32.383]  Uranium!
[00:48:32.403 --> 00:48:36.945]  New York Daily News didn't believe it, tested 14 troops who were dying.
[00:48:37.425 --> 00:48:42.648]  All 14, none of them were hypochondriacs, all 14 had two rims of radiation in them.
[00:48:43.448 --> 00:48:46.530]  And the new scientists did CAT scans of their lungs, a bunch of other troops.
[00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:48.611]  Giant fogs everywhere.
[00:48:49.291 --> 00:48:50.292]  They shrivel up, they die.
[00:48:51.633 --> 00:49:07.705]  What type of elite do we have who knowingly knows this is bad and uses it twice in Iraq, once in Serbia, although they've had a quadrupling of deformities there, in Afghanistan and in ten sites in the United States.
[00:49:08.325 --> 00:49:09.246]  Open air sites.
[00:49:12.789 --> 00:49:14.510]  Folks, this is insanity.
[00:49:15.931 --> 00:49:17.112]  Why does the elite do this?
[00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:22.151]  It has a half-life of 500 million years.
[00:49:22.531 --> 00:49:24.412]  That means it doesn't start weakening.
[00:49:24.852 --> 00:49:26.092]  It's full strength!
[00:49:27.513 --> 00:49:27.933]  Or what is it?
[00:49:27.953 --> 00:49:29.793]  540-something million years.
[00:49:32.014 --> 00:49:33.594]  It will be radioactive.
[00:49:34.355 --> 00:49:34.895]  What was the number?
[00:49:34.915 --> 00:49:34.895]  4.
[00:49:35.295 --> 00:49:36.995]  40 billion years.
[00:49:40.876 --> 00:49:43.157]  40 billion years.
[00:49:44.297 --> 00:49:45.998]  Half-life of 40-something million.
[00:49:46.952 --> 00:49:47.753]  400 million, excuse me.
[00:49:48.213 --> 00:49:49.214]  I've got to dig these numbers up.
[00:49:50.134 --> 00:49:51.395]  It's just mind-blowing.
[00:49:51.415 --> 00:49:58.460]  When you get into these numbers, it's hard to... 45 million or 400 million?
[00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:00.821]  I think it's 400 million of the half-life.
[00:50:01.822 --> 00:50:02.222]  You know what?
[00:50:02.382 --> 00:50:05.464]  Somebody dig it up online and call me the radioactive half-life.
[00:50:05.524 --> 00:50:08.486]  It'll be on university websites of depleted uranium.
[00:50:10.147 --> 00:50:11.488]  The point is it's millions of years.
[00:50:11.868 --> 00:50:14.690]  And billions and billions until it's non-radioactive.
[00:50:15.698 --> 00:50:17.379]  Not to mention the heavy metal effects of this.
[00:50:17.959 --> 00:50:20.580]  This is blowing over here, it's not just over there.
[00:50:22.481 --> 00:50:26.842]  What type of government feeds pesticides to children?
[00:50:26.862 --> 00:50:33.265]  I mean, it was in the New York Daily News that they would go to a poor black mother and say, give us your 8 year old or we're going to take your 2 year old.
[00:50:33.785 --> 00:50:35.065]  And she'd cry and give them the child.
[00:50:35.526 --> 00:50:36.546]  And they'd take little Billy,
[00:50:37.139 --> 00:50:38.801]  And they even mention kids' names!
[00:50:39.321 --> 00:50:40.562]  I even had families on about it!
[00:50:40.702 --> 00:50:42.684]  When I was first talking about it three years ago, when I first learned.
[00:50:42.965 --> 00:50:43.985]  Now the scandal's gotten bigger.
[00:50:44.246 --> 00:50:46.067]  And they would give them these drugs.
[00:50:46.628 --> 00:50:48.109]  Give them pesticides.
[00:50:49.110 --> 00:50:50.091]  Some of them would die!
[00:50:52.814 --> 00:50:56.357]  They would put our troops in a containment facility and nerve gas them and kill them.
[00:50:56.697 --> 00:50:58.319]  Tell their family they died accidentally.
[00:51:01.681 --> 00:51:03.183]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.383 --> 00:51:06.486]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.606 --> 00:51:10.530]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.570 --> 00:51:14.815]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:51:15.155 --> 00:51:18.919]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:18.999 --> 00:51:20.861]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:21.481 --> 00:51:24.362]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[00:51:24.402 --> 00:51:29.103]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:29.263 --> 00:51:32.324]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.484 --> 00:51:35.345]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.845 --> 00:51:41.967]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.487 --> 00:51:46.292]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[00:52:01.215 --> 00:52:05.116]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:52:05.336 --> 00:52:10.777]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.

[00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:25.921]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:52:26.081 --> 00:52:26.561]  I don't know.
[00:52:41.032 --> 00:52:41.552]  We're good to go.

[00:53:42.567 --> 00:53:46.970]  Check out our online member testimonials and our hundreds of exceptional products.
[00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:50.312]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:50.472 --> 00:53:56.336]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:10.581 --> 00:54:24.765]  Alright, Scott running the show just went to the big Federal Regulatory Agency on Uranium, Plutonium, and I stand corrected.
[00:54:25.605 --> 00:54:30.087]  The radioactive half-life is four and a half billion years on depleted Uranium.
[00:54:31.147 --> 00:54:33.908]  Four and a half billion, but I know from memory, I've had Dr.
[00:54:35.063 --> 00:54:58.403]  Rocky and others on who wrote the book on it and they were saying hundreds of millions of years ago it was 400 something million until it begins to lose some of its full power effect but does it matter what I mean it was a million it'd be bad enough it was a thousand it'd be bad enough four and a half billion so as usual it's much worse than I said going from memory I believe it loses all of its radioactive properties
[00:54:59.986 --> 00:55:01.567]  I believe it's over 40 billion years.
[00:55:02.407 --> 00:55:03.628]  We can try to find that number.
[00:55:03.968 --> 00:55:09.911]  But the half-life, before it starts degrading at all, is four and a half billion.
[00:55:11.031 --> 00:55:19.375]  So, again, if it was a thousand or four and a half billion, it really doesn't matter, but it is four and a half billion, according to official government numbers.
[00:55:20.896 --> 00:55:22.477]  I'm not really an expert on these things.
[00:55:23.377 --> 00:55:25.918]  Boy, so, this is your government.
[00:55:26.178 --> 00:55:27.519]  This is what they're doing.
[00:55:28.892 --> 00:55:33.873]  And they used thousands and thousands of tons.
[00:55:36.314 --> 00:55:43.055]  In Iraq, just this last go-around, they bombarded Republican Guard bases in Saddam's palaces.
[00:55:44.135 --> 00:55:50.037]  They served out the ammunition for .50 cals for Bradley fighting vehicle guns.
[00:55:52.217 --> 00:55:55.998]  It's not just in the 18 Warthogs or the Abrams sabot rounds anymore.
[00:55:57.845 --> 00:55:59.647]  It is in scores.
[00:56:00.808 --> 00:56:02.870]  The Pentagon has a list of it, of ammunition.
[00:56:04.411 --> 00:56:18.184]  And there's been a few cases where the Iraqis are able to steal a tank round and they pry it out and take it and mold it into their own small arms rounds because they can take the big old, I don't know, two foot long
[00:56:19.294 --> 00:56:22.395]  Uranium rod out of the Abrams shell.
[00:56:22.735 --> 00:56:27.836]  They can make a bunch of bullets out of it and just a little bitty 50 cal bullet shoots right through an Abrams.
[00:56:27.936 --> 00:56:29.036]  Just right through it.
[00:56:30.596 --> 00:56:34.957]  And we've had quite a few Abrams knocked out because of that.
[00:56:37.218 --> 00:56:39.138]  And this stuff is so deadly.
[00:56:40.258 --> 00:56:42.039]  And the globalists, their children are breathing it.
[00:56:42.079 --> 00:56:43.439]  George Bush's daughters breathe it.
[00:56:45.119 --> 00:56:48.500]  I see Bill Clinton on TV drinking Diet Coke, which aspartame is deadly.
[00:56:49.563 --> 00:56:50.803]  I mean, they just revel in it!
[00:56:50.843 --> 00:56:51.424]  They love it!
[00:56:53.084 --> 00:56:53.984]  They just don't care!
[00:56:54.004 --> 00:57:07.849]  And of course, they're just puppets, but you hear about Senator Rockefeller, West Virginia, you hear about Prince Philip, you know, they're all into health and these special cleansings, and maybe they've got the cure to all this, so they don't care.
[00:57:07.869 --> 00:57:12.370]  And there are many that just don't care about their own families.
[00:57:13.110 --> 00:57:15.511]  You've got to get your mind around who these people are!
[00:57:17.954 --> 00:57:27.418]  Before we end the show, please get Marshall Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[00:57:29.119 --> 00:57:32.440]  It's three hours on DVD, two hours, 35 minutes on VHS.

[00:57:34.881 --> 00:57:36.302]  Four films on the DVD, really.
[00:57:37.205 --> 00:57:43.769]  The police state, 9-11, and who the elite is, their order of death, and why they love death so much, and they're driving audiologies.

[00:58:41.853 --> 00:58:46.315]  Two great guests coming up in your calls, so stay with us.
[00:58:47.136 --> 00:58:47.576]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.375 --> 00:59:00.415]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.136 --> 00:59:02.236]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.896 --> 00:59:03.716]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.476 --> 00:59:05.377]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.037 --> 00:59:09.858]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.218 --> 00:59:14.299]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:23.386 --> 00:59:28.189]  Alright, second hour on this live Wednesday, the fourth day of May 2005 edition.
[00:59:28.249 --> 00:59:33.871]  I'm Alex Jones, David Ray Griffin, author of The New Pearl Harbor.
[00:59:33.891 --> 00:59:48.639]  He's going to be joining us coming up in about 30 minutes, and of course they're going to be re-airing the presentation he gave on C-SPAN last Saturday, again this Saturday at 2.30 Eastern on Book TV on C-SPAN, C-SPAN I guess three
[00:59:49.655 --> 00:59:52.017]  For those that just joined us, but that's coming up.
[00:59:52.357 --> 00:59:54.438]  I know we've got a lot of callers.
[00:59:54.478 --> 00:59:55.779]  We'll get to you as well.
[00:59:56.319 --> 00:59:59.421]  A lot of important police, state, and economic news we'll be covering.
[01:00:01.042 --> 01:00:15.290]  But I heard about Tom Laughlin, and I was aware of some of his important feature films that he made back in the seventies, distributed by Fox and Warner Brothers, you name it.
[01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:18.932]  I'm sure you've heard of the Billy Jack trilogy.
[01:00:19.989 --> 01:00:21.972]  He's making a new one, but it's documentary style.
[01:00:22.292 --> 01:00:24.855]  He's also made quite a few other award-winning documentaries.
[01:00:24.875 --> 01:00:32.105]  He's considered one of the founding fathers of, really, the modern independent film movement in this country.
[01:00:32.205 --> 01:00:37.632]  And he's now launching, via his website, an operation to expose the
[01:00:38.661 --> 01:00:44.565]  The world government fascist agenda being set up by the neocons right now.
[01:00:44.585 --> 01:00:46.426]  So I was excited to hear about that.
[01:00:46.466 --> 01:00:47.587]  So we've got him on with us.
[01:00:47.647 --> 01:00:49.829]  And Tom, thanks for spending time with us today.
[01:00:50.249 --> 01:00:50.990]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:00:51.030 --> 01:00:51.750]  Thanks for having me.
[01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:52.791]  Let me just jump in.
[01:00:53.151 --> 01:00:55.813]  The new Billy Jack film is not a documentary.
[01:00:56.445 --> 01:01:02.133]  It's going to be, again, Billy Jack is... I just saw that it said documentary style.
[01:01:02.513 --> 01:01:02.693]  Huh?
[01:01:03.274 --> 01:01:05.297]  I was reading a review, it said documentary style.
[01:01:05.577 --> 01:01:06.178]  No, no, no.
[01:01:06.598 --> 01:01:09.762]  It's going to break ground that no one has ever done before in a film.
[01:01:09.823 --> 01:01:12.306]  It's going to be a full length Billy Jack feature film.
[01:01:12.850 --> 01:01:41.532]  With six controversial themes, the political one is so inflammatory, but it's the least controversial, and four love stories, but it's going to combine, as no film has ever done before, it's going to combine the full-length feature picture with documentary footage, with real cinema verite, and computer graphics, like you see Forrest Gump talking with John Kennedy,
[01:01:42.139 --> 01:01:46.581]  Well, you're going to see Billy Jack taking Bush head on in the computer graphics.
[01:01:46.661 --> 01:01:52.663]  It's unlike any film ever done, but it's the sequel that people have been, the Billy Jack fans at least, have been waiting for.
[01:01:53.423 --> 01:01:53.743]  All right.
[01:01:53.763 --> 01:01:55.023]  I mean, I was just reading a review of it.
[01:01:55.063 --> 01:01:57.044]  It said documentary footage inserted.
[01:01:57.204 --> 01:01:59.125]  And so I was, that's where I came up with that.
[01:01:59.165 --> 01:01:59.405]  Right.
[01:02:00.535 --> 01:02:01.276]  Very interesting.
[01:02:01.336 --> 01:02:04.659]  Why have you decided to get involved?
[01:02:05.219 --> 01:02:09.523]  Well, the bottom line is this is a huge risk for Dolores and I. We paid our dues.
[01:02:10.084 --> 01:02:11.205]  We deserve to retire.
[01:02:11.245 --> 01:02:17.330]  But this country is plunging in the most dangerous way it has ever done in our short history.
[01:02:18.031 --> 01:02:22.755]  I happen, you don't know this Alex, but I'm bragging to you, I happen to have
[01:02:23.377 --> 01:02:23.537]  I'm
[01:02:42.047 --> 01:02:45.949]  Eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:56.614]  Well, these people have taken over this government in a way, if you know anything about fascism, I'm sure you do, there are several things they do.
[01:02:56.714 --> 01:03:00.936]  Step one is you crush all opposition, all criticism, all dissent.
[01:03:00.996 --> 01:03:03.938]  Not only from without, but from in your own party.
[01:03:04.531 --> 01:03:08.794]  Number two, you then take control of all the key seats of government with your friends.
[01:03:09.555 --> 01:03:11.096]  And they've done that.
[01:03:11.437 --> 01:03:13.338]  They've taken over the executive branch.
[01:03:13.398 --> 01:03:15.600]  They've taken over the legislative branch.
[01:03:16.441 --> 01:03:17.581]  Completely controlling.
[01:03:17.601 --> 01:03:18.742]  They've got most of the governors.
[01:03:18.963 --> 01:03:20.804]  We've got a break sir, a long segment coming up.
[01:03:20.864 --> 01:03:23.066]  I want to recap all this and get into your new film.
[01:03:24.047 --> 01:03:27.229]  That's doing some revolutionary things with the way it's going to be produced.
[01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:30.211]  And then I want to talk about 9-11 with you.
[01:03:30.872 --> 01:03:31.893]  And I also want to
[01:03:32.967 --> 01:03:34.668]  Dissect what fascism is.
[01:03:35.488 --> 01:03:45.672]  I don't really consider this fascism, I consider it neo-mercantilism, which is a more proper term to describe the system we're facing, but fascism's a good enough label.
[01:03:45.972 --> 01:03:48.133]  We'll be right back with our guest.
[01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:57.933]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:58.113 --> 01:04:02.537]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.677 --> 01:04:07.061]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:07.101 --> 01:04:08.462]  The New World Order.
[01:04:09.363 --> 01:04:10.023]  Animer.
[01:04:10.224 --> 01:04:14.468]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:14.528 --> 01:04:21.456]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:21.576 --> 01:04:23.599]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.939 --> 01:04:34.384]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:34.584 --> 01:04:39.987]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:05:03.061 --> 01:05:05.542]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:05:05.922 --> 01:05:20.491]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[01:06:21.623 --> 01:06:25.286]  I owed so much on my credit cards, I could barely make the minimum monthly payment.
[01:06:25.406 --> 01:06:28.369]  We talked about filing bankruptcy, but I was concerned about my credit.
[01:06:28.570 --> 01:06:30.551]  That's when I called Debt Relief USA.
[01:06:30.772 --> 01:06:34.415]  They set up a plan for me, where I could settle for just 40% of what I owed.

[01:06:57.126 --> 01:06:59.967]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:00.947 --> 01:07:04.388]  We've been given false terms, a false paradigm.
[01:07:04.448 --> 01:07:06.529]  It's not about left or right, it's about right and wrong.
[01:07:07.572 --> 01:07:32.991]  And the corporate owners of this world, of the 100 biggest economies, 45 of them are corporations, not governments, the corporate owners of our President, and the Democratic Party as well, are turning America into a textbook fascist police state, and using globalism, which is really just modern mercantilism, to control the nations of the world, bringing us into this corrupt world empire.
[01:07:33.866 --> 01:07:36.613]  And I was on Tom Laughlin's great website.
[01:07:36.653 --> 01:07:40.321]  He, of course, is an award-winning actor and writer and director.
[01:07:42.919 --> 01:07:48.045]  A new Billy Jack movie coming out that's going to be revolutionary, and we'll talk about that some with him.
[01:07:48.365 --> 01:07:58.596]  And as he was saying in the last segment, he's one of the few people that has, who wasn't, quote, one of the establishment scholars to be lecturing under the Jeffersonian Institution's dome.
[01:07:59.296 --> 01:08:05.223]  And it's good to have him on with us, and he wanted to go through the different characteristics of fascism.
[01:08:06.184 --> 01:08:19.979]  But before we go any further, for those who just joined us and who may not know who you are, most people probably do, tell us a little bit about yourself and again, why you're getting involved and what you think about what's currently happening in this country, sir.
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:23.583]  Oh, what's happening is terrifying and that's why we're getting involved.
[01:08:23.643 --> 01:08:25.025]  You know, my wife and I,
[01:08:25.678 --> 01:08:25.958]  I don't
[01:08:55.998 --> 01:08:56.639]  We're good to go.
[01:09:17.015 --> 01:09:22.517]  He was going to build the largest, in this building, the largest embassy, 6,000 people in the world.
[01:09:22.797 --> 01:09:25.678]  This was always about oil from the beginning.
[01:09:25.698 --> 01:09:32.640]  What no one knows, and very few people know, is before the war, America and Britain were shut out of the oil fields.
[01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:42.983]  China had the Mansour Field, Russia had the Ramallah Field, France had the largest ones, the Narbonne, Omar, etc.
[01:09:43.244 --> 01:09:43.864]  We had none.
[01:09:45.340 --> 01:10:00.436]  And, unknown reserves of oil were found in Iraq, 250 billion barrels, that make it the largest and richest oil nation in the world, far surpassing Saudi Arabia, who hasn't found a new oil field since the 1970s.
[01:10:00.917 --> 01:10:04.580]  So what we did, what he did, was invade it as an oil colony.
[01:10:05.081 --> 01:10:07.744]  And he invaded it for that, so to this day,
[01:10:08.263 --> 01:10:14.147]  You know, 1,500 American, beautiful American, these are mothers and fathers.
[01:10:14.307 --> 01:10:15.087]  More than that.
[01:10:15.167 --> 01:10:16.548]  They're leaving kids orphans.
[01:10:16.929 --> 01:10:20.611]  They've died or been terminally mutilated for haliburton oil.
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:26.541]  Well, 300 to 500,000 Iraqis have been mutilated for a lie!
[01:10:27.022 --> 01:10:33.683]  And the lie they told us, which now everyone knows was a lie, they knew was a lie back at the beginning.
[01:10:34.104 --> 01:10:36.124]  Let me just interject something here, Tom.
[01:10:36.144 --> 01:10:36.484]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:10:36.844 --> 01:10:42.866]  People like to focus on Richard Clark and say, oh, sour grapes, or on the Treasury Secretary O'Neill, but
[01:10:43.467 --> 01:10:53.828]  Dick Cheney in the PNAC document, Rebuilding America's Defenses, published by him September 20th, 2000, says Saddam is not a threat.
[01:10:54.406 --> 01:11:06.453]  But, claiming he has weapons of mass destruction is a good pretext to invade and use Iraq as a military base to then invade Iran and Syria and set up hegemony.
[01:11:06.814 --> 01:11:16.019]  So, it's... But the media ignores that when we have his... And then he said we need a helpful Pearl Harbor style attack.
[01:11:16.059 --> 01:11:16.740]  Were you aware of that?
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:17.680]  Oh, yes.
[01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:19.281]  Absolutely aware of it.
[01:11:19.321 --> 01:11:22.343]  Go back to 1972 when Cheney and Wolfowitz
[01:11:22.882 --> 01:11:29.086]  Did, you know, what we now call the Bush Doctrine for Bush Senior, which was to dominate and control the world.
[01:11:29.486 --> 01:11:33.669]  It's all spelled out, the most fascist, imperialistic document in American history.
[01:11:33.689 --> 01:11:47.738]  Well, that doesn't mean... The fact is, the day after 9-11 happened, Rumsfeld called in everybody, all 15 intelligence agencies and said, he wants proof that Hussein was 9-11, Al Qaeda, WMD, nuclear, go get me the proof.
[01:11:48.403 --> 01:11:57.012]  After four months of hearing, every single agency came back and told him there was absolutely no connection.
[01:11:57.392 --> 01:11:58.873]  There wasn't faulty intelligence.
[01:11:59.314 --> 01:12:05.740]  What Rumsfeld said was, that's not good enough, give us your own raw data and we'll come up with our own conclusion.
[01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:09.644]  He then formed a secret intelligence unit inside the Pentagon.
[01:12:10.074 --> 01:12:14.435]  And they made up all what they are still referring to as faulty intelligence.
[01:12:14.495 --> 01:12:23.358]  And they didn't want to put their name on it, so they took a graduate student's article written 12 years before, and then claimed that MI6 gave it to them.
[01:12:23.578 --> 01:12:24.598]  Yes, exactly.
[01:12:24.658 --> 01:12:27.259]  Ray McGovern, a veteran of 27 years CIA.
[01:12:29.019 --> 01:12:32.462]  We used to be on George Bush Senior's briefing committee, etc.
[01:12:33.123 --> 01:12:35.985]  Robert Baer and others, all these people told the truth.
[01:12:36.365 --> 01:12:40.769]  We didn't air it here, we aired it on BBC, but they all said there was no connection.
[01:12:41.170 --> 01:12:50.518]  Colleen Rowley, a terror investigation for the FBI, said not only isn't there, but if you invade them, you will create a insurgency you've never had.
[01:12:50.538 --> 01:12:55.302]  Alex, I don't mean to use words that are nasty, but I can use bull spit.
[01:12:55.782 --> 01:12:56.683]  Bull spit!
[01:12:57.123 --> 01:13:00.605]  That it's coming out now is that we brought freedom and democracy to America.
[01:13:00.625 --> 01:13:01.405]  Let me ask you a question, sir.
[01:13:01.425 --> 01:13:02.286]  I mean, to Iraq.
[01:13:02.726 --> 01:13:05.327]  It is so insane to say that.
[01:13:05.867 --> 01:13:06.728]  It is insane.
[01:13:06.808 --> 01:13:08.429]  Let me give you a simple example.
[01:13:10.830 --> 01:13:16.392]  Before the war, all kinds of people, including Sean Penn, could walk the streets of Iraq and envy the people.
[01:13:16.813 --> 01:13:21.335]  Today, even reporters can't spend more than 10 or 20 minutes and they'll be killed.
[01:13:21.755 --> 01:13:23.916]  It's a bloodbath, beyond a bloodbath.
[01:13:24.666 --> 01:13:26.608]  Uh, because of the hated American.
[01:13:26.668 --> 01:13:29.330]  We are seen as fascist occupants, which we are!
[01:13:29.770 --> 01:13:43.582]  We invaded it for the oil, made up all this other nonsense, and now we turn around and say there exists a democracy, which is really a Vichy puppet government, and Chalabi, you know who Chalabi went to school with in the United States?
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:45.100]  Wolfowitz.
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:47.701]  He's one of their... He's a Straussian.
[01:13:47.961 --> 01:13:48.201]  Huh?
[01:13:48.681 --> 01:13:49.661]  He's a Straussian.
[01:13:49.881 --> 01:13:51.021]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:13:51.201 --> 01:14:03.664]  So the point is, all of these lies to get all these beautiful American and hundreds of thousands of beautiful Iraqi innocent civilians and children blood flowing.
[01:14:03.884 --> 01:14:06.945]  So our number one crusade of this movie is to end the war.
[01:14:07.445 --> 01:14:11.846]  We're going to end the war and the way we're going to do it, Alex, will thrill your viewers.
[01:14:12.306 --> 01:14:14.086]  We're going to hold an open
[01:14:14.813 --> 01:14:24.541]  televised public hearing to impeach Bush and Cheney, not government, not... We sat there and said, why is it only the government officials hold these hearings?
[01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:26.983]  I mean, why don't the people hold their own hearings?
[01:14:27.343 --> 01:14:40.915]  So this is going to be, the panel is going to be people who are victims of the war, eleven people, and we're going to hold a hearing to see and give all this stuff, all the truth about why we're there and why these people are dying for Halliburton Oil.
[01:14:41.495 --> 01:14:43.437]  I mean, you know, this is treason.
[01:14:44.416 --> 01:14:45.216]  And bribery!
[01:14:46.437 --> 01:15:00.062]  Cheney got 33 million dollars from Halliburton Lawyer as a so-called bonus, and since then, by the way, since then he's done nothing but deliver in spades for Halliburton, and as you know, in dozens of ways.
[01:15:00.302 --> 01:15:01.723]  But no one is saying anything!
[01:15:01.843 --> 01:15:02.943]  Everything is afraid!
[01:15:03.643 --> 01:15:12.787]  All of the great celebrities that came out against the war, Sean Penn, Michael... the guy from... President, what's his name?
[01:15:14.146 --> 01:15:18.168]  Tom, take a breath for a second.
[01:15:18.188 --> 01:15:19.208]  I've got to tell you something here.
[01:15:19.568 --> 01:15:21.348]  You haven't heard from any of them, they're afraid.
[01:15:21.509 --> 01:15:22.349]  I don't think you can hear me.
[01:15:22.429 --> 01:15:23.449]  Can you boost his audio?
[01:15:23.789 --> 01:15:24.289]  Hey, Tom.
[01:15:24.649 --> 01:15:24.870]  Yeah.
[01:15:25.030 --> 01:15:25.530]  Can you hear me?
[01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:25.990]  Yeah.
[01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:26.850]  Okay, good.
[01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:31.592]  You're making a lot of good points, and we've gone over these before many times, believe me.
[01:15:31.912 --> 01:15:33.412]  I have a very well-informed audience.
[01:15:33.632 --> 01:15:36.153]  I do want to talk about when your film's going to come out and
[01:15:37.734 --> 01:15:56.592]  What it's going to be covering, but if I could, just first, because you're a good person, obviously, you're active, you're involved, I'd like to perhaps, because I'm sure you're very informed and you sound very intelligent, I'd like to give you just my little piece of knowledge to hopefully help you a little bit.
[01:15:56.972 --> 01:15:57.172]  Right.
[01:15:59.489 --> 01:16:01.691]  Use Bush and Cheney as their puppets.
[01:16:01.751 --> 01:16:05.593]  I mean, they're making hundreds of billions a year off the weapon sales and oil.
[01:16:06.014 --> 01:16:07.434]  Cheney gets 30-something million.
[01:16:07.775 --> 01:16:09.336]  These are mid-level puppets.
[01:16:09.956 --> 01:16:18.582]  And the globalists have given us a false, left-right choice of, oh, the UN's going to save us from the evil Anglo-American establishment.
[01:16:18.802 --> 01:16:27.708]  But what I'm telling you is, is that when you go to the higher levels, it's all owned by the same people, and they're playing good cop, bad cop across the Atlantic.
[01:16:29.884 --> 01:16:37.031]  So many people who are out there, who are speaking about these issues, Tom, never are putting the pieces together.
[01:16:37.071 --> 01:16:42.095]  And what I liked about your website is you point out how the Democrats are bought and paid for as well.
[01:16:42.115 --> 01:16:43.096]  Do you have any comments on that?
[01:16:43.597 --> 01:16:45.418]  Oh, first of all, you're dead right.
[01:16:45.539 --> 01:16:48.501]  I know everything that you're saying, and you're absolutely right.
[01:16:48.982 --> 01:16:54.587]  And the multinational oligarchy is one of the three fascist groups that control Bush and Cheney.
[01:16:55.106 --> 01:17:03.239]  The others are the idealists, the Wolfowitz Group, and the other are the really fascist, right-wing evangelicals.
[01:17:03.792 --> 01:17:18.842]  Now, I also happen to have a huge history in Christianity, and the way we're attacking them, they have perverted and distorted the Gospels of Christ from Jesus' real teachings, and we're going to take them on and show people these are not Christian at all!
[01:17:18.962 --> 01:17:20.042]  Well, tell us about the film.
[01:17:20.242 --> 01:17:21.203]  They have to be stopped.
[01:17:21.243 --> 01:17:28.107]  The film, see, I look at my shelf here, Alex, there's 150 books there on Bush, all of them brilliant, but who cares?
[01:17:28.248 --> 01:17:28.888]  Nobody reads.
[01:17:29.491 --> 01:17:30.871]  Unless there's a megaphone.
[01:17:30.911 --> 01:17:36.973]  You've got a radio show and you have a listening audience that is powerful and very effective, but it's a small group.
[01:17:37.733 --> 01:17:51.876]  Compared to when a film goes out there and becomes an international monument, that's a megaphone that somebody has to do to get all of the stuff you know, your viewers know, all of us know, to get that out into the world.
[01:17:52.443 --> 01:17:55.445]  For the mainstream people who don't give a damn about politics.
[01:17:55.746 --> 01:17:58.928]  Who never watch Meet the Press on Sunday morning.
[01:17:59.489 --> 01:18:00.810]  That's why we're making this film.
[01:18:00.850 --> 01:18:02.931]  There's no other way this country is going to be saved.
[01:18:03.412 --> 01:18:04.973]  Unless someone dares to risk.
[01:18:05.998 --> 01:18:15.182]  Uh, you know, taking, making a major feature picture and giving all of the voice, giving voice to you and all of the people who know all this stuff.
[01:18:15.542 --> 01:18:21.185]  Otherwise, you're just going to be on C-SPAN and some talk show radios and write a book.
[01:18:21.605 --> 01:18:24.206]  But the main public is going to remain untouched.
[01:18:24.726 --> 01:18:26.327]  And that's why it's crucial.
[01:18:26.812 --> 01:18:30.175]  Crucial that we make a feature that's the size of Billy Jack.
[01:18:30.235 --> 01:18:35.319]  Just so you know, Billy Jack is the most profitable independent film ever made.
[01:18:35.859 --> 01:18:37.701]  Some people say My Fat Greek Wedding.
[01:18:37.981 --> 01:18:40.122]  They sold 37 million tickets U.S.
[01:18:40.463 --> 01:18:43.945]  We sold 57 million when there were 100 million less people in the U.S.
[01:18:43.965 --> 01:18:45.026]  Well, I'll tell you what, Tom, stay there.
[01:18:45.046 --> 01:18:45.787]  We've got a break again.
[01:18:45.847 --> 01:18:46.688]  Final segment with you.
[01:18:46.708 --> 01:18:47.388]  This is intriguing.
[01:18:47.408 --> 01:18:48.049]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:48.069 --> 01:18:48.409]  Stay with us.
[01:18:54.190 --> 01:18:56.551]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:18:56.792 --> 01:19:00.634]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:19:00.954 --> 01:19:01.775]  Read the labels.
[01:19:02.195 --> 01:19:06.337]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:19:06.537 --> 01:19:10.740]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:15.983]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:19:16.363 --> 01:19:19.926]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:19:20.147 --> 01:19:25.491]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:19:25.752 --> 01:19:28.494]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:19:28.774 --> 01:19:29.675]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:19:29.975 --> 01:19:40.725]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.

[01:19:54.855 --> 01:19:59.357]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:19:59.697 --> 01:20:03.778]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:20:04.079 --> 01:20:04.639]  We listened.
[01:20:04.939 --> 01:20:09.921]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:20:10.201 --> 01:20:10.681]  We listened.
[01:20:11.061 --> 01:20:14.102]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:20:14.522 --> 01:20:15.063]  We listened.
[01:20:15.523 --> 01:20:18.524]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and driving.
[01:20:18.524 --> 01:20:19.225]  We're good to go.
[01:20:45.431 --> 01:20:49.033]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[01:20:49.053 --> 01:20:52.595]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:20:53.716 --> 01:21:00.100]  To the farthest corners of the earth, explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.

[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:59.462]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:00.162 --> 01:23:02.503]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:04.224 --> 01:23:05.925]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:23:06.025 --> 01:23:07.966]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:23:08.875 --> 01:23:10.256]  I was talking to him during the break.
[01:23:10.276 --> 01:23:16.618]  There's no way to get all the great info that our guest has in 30 minutes, so I'm going to set him up for a full hour here very soon.
[01:23:16.658 --> 01:23:17.539]  He's agreed to do that.
[01:23:18.139 --> 01:23:21.340]  The website's billyjack.com, billyjack.com.
[01:23:22.041 --> 01:23:24.402]  We have a link to it at infowars.com.
[01:23:25.222 --> 01:23:36.487]  We were just ranting and raving to each other during the four-minute break about vaccines and the mercury and how they appoint these whitewash commissions and about just all of it.
[01:23:37.639 --> 01:23:38.919]  And he's right.
[01:23:38.939 --> 01:23:41.100]  I mean, they are really bringing this country down.
[01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:42.160]  They're destroying it.
[01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:43.360]  They're not just damaging it.
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:58.703]  Here in the last few minutes we've got, sir, can you talk more about your film, more about these citizens' trials to get attention, these public trials to expose the whitewash, and can you also get a little bit into if you think we can bring these criminals down?
[01:23:59.063 --> 01:23:59.883]  Yeah.
[01:24:00.003 --> 01:24:03.224]  The quick thing is in the Billy Jack film, in the political part of it,
[01:24:03.604 --> 01:24:17.652]  We take on the corruption of, we show in a way the public, even your audience has, but even other than that, they don't know what really has gone on behind the scenes to create this war and the lying of these people and the fascist destruction.
[01:24:17.992 --> 01:24:20.053]  So we give you that information in a way.
[01:24:20.653 --> 01:24:24.375]  Quickly, just quick, did you know that we sent Hussein into Kuwait?
[01:24:24.936 --> 01:24:29.178]  We give you the hard evidence, the detailed evidence by three of the people who were involved.
[01:24:30.042 --> 01:24:31.603]  And we sent him in there as a lesson.
[01:24:32.403 --> 01:24:39.927]  All of the stuff we've been told is such a lie, and look at the beautiful people that are being murdered every day, the American soldiers who believe in these guys!
[01:24:40.528 --> 01:24:45.590]  So the film shows this beautiful exit plan, and let me give it to you, Alex, it's very simple.
[01:24:46.131 --> 01:24:57.176]  Once you understand that the whole reason we are in Iraq is for a private oil colony for Halliburton and Friends Oil, all you have to do to end our involvement there, and end it in 90 days,
[01:24:58.477 --> 01:25:03.279]  Is give back the oil to the French, the Chinese, and the Russians who we stole it from.
[01:25:03.759 --> 01:25:05.460]  Give it to the Iraqis, the least of them.
[01:25:05.900 --> 01:25:07.001]  They'll bring in their troops.
[01:25:07.041 --> 01:25:10.462]  They're not the fascist, hated occupiers who stole the oil.
[01:25:10.762 --> 01:25:11.943]  And we get out and it's over.
[01:25:12.483 --> 01:25:13.983]  All we have to do is give back the oil.
[01:25:14.003 --> 01:25:15.784]  But of course, Bush is never going to do that.
[01:25:16.104 --> 01:25:17.945]  So the film goes ahead to impeach him.
[01:25:17.965 --> 01:25:20.386]  And the way we impeach him, we don't, we're not Congress.
[01:25:20.706 --> 01:25:27.289]  They say, why don't we just have a panel of the victims of the war who are an 11 person panel who conduct
[01:25:27.802 --> 01:25:41.987]  Just like an investigation, only it's open and on television, and we test and we show how this has all been about oil, how the lies to get us in there are horrendous, how the lies keeping us there are even more horrendous, and we then
[01:25:44.312 --> 01:25:54.379]  The people in the movie just, you know, once they understand what really is going on, which they can't get now through the corporate-owned media, boy, they pour into the streets by the tens of millions.
[01:25:54.679 --> 01:25:55.700]  And we're out of that war!
[01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:57.401]  And we impeach Bush and Cheney.
[01:25:57.681 --> 01:26:02.024]  People think that the reason Clinton was impeached because it was a Republican Congress.
[01:26:02.104 --> 01:26:02.985]  Just the opposite.
[01:26:03.405 --> 01:26:07.228]  Robert Barr, when he tried to get him impeached, the Republicans didn't want any part of it.
[01:26:07.308 --> 01:26:08.329]  It was going to backfire.
[01:26:08.829 --> 01:26:09.710]  So they refused to.
[01:26:09.730 --> 01:26:11.652]  He had to go out and do a grassroots movement.
[01:26:11.992 --> 01:26:17.278]  So our trial, our open trial, and I begged your listeners to go to our website.
[01:26:17.694 --> 01:26:25.680]  BillyJack.com and see how it works because once people understand how they can have their own hearings, you don't have to have Congress hold a hearing.
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:28.922]  You don't have to... The people can hold their own.
[01:26:29.062 --> 01:26:37.348]  On Vioxx, on all of these issues to them, it can be a no political weapon people can use and the movie is going to show you how to do that.
[01:26:37.688 --> 01:26:40.630]  But before that, we're going to do our own in September
[01:26:41.310 --> 01:26:54.226]  On impeaching Bush and Cheney is the only way to end this war and stop the hemorrhaging of these beautiful... And make it a big production and get the local media out there and if we have hundreds of these across the country it could push it over the edge.
[01:26:54.587 --> 01:26:55.208]  Oh it will.
[01:26:55.268 --> 01:26:59.473]  We're going to build the same grassroots movement to impeach Bush and Cheney.
[01:27:00.024 --> 01:27:07.147]  As Barr did back then when he finally brought so much pressure, the Republicans who didn't want to impeach him did the impeachment inquiry.
[01:27:07.568 --> 01:27:08.608]  So we're going to do that.
[01:27:08.988 --> 01:27:14.331]  We're going to end this war and we're going to impeach these guys and it's got to be done instead of talking about it.
[01:27:14.351 --> 01:27:15.311]  Okay, here's the problem.
[01:27:15.351 --> 01:27:24.015]  What do you do when Bush nukes a city or releases smallpox and blames it on enemies and says, you guys held me back from protecting you, it's your fault?
[01:27:25.242 --> 01:27:26.423]  Make sure he doesn't do that.
[01:27:27.183 --> 01:27:36.708]  By the way, one of the things we have in here is you tell me why it's moral for us to go with our Congress, the UN, whatever, and say, let's invade a country.
[01:27:37.108 --> 01:27:42.951]  Why isn't it more moral to say, go to the Senate, get approval, and declare, say, Hussein a war criminal.
[01:27:44.072 --> 01:27:47.073]  And we go after him instead of invade the country and kill innocent people.
[01:27:47.113 --> 01:27:51.936]  Because then they wouldn't get the oil and have the weapon sales and use Iraq as a launch base against Iran and Syria.
[01:27:52.296 --> 01:27:53.237]  Exactly.
[01:27:53.277 --> 01:27:55.199]  And by the way, I want to leave you with this, Alex.
[01:27:55.219 --> 01:27:58.042]  You know why these oil prices are so high, the gas prices?
[01:27:58.463 --> 01:28:04.369]  In that occupation plan before he was even sworn in, Bush had one in his first term.
[01:28:05.069 --> 01:28:08.233]  They would make sure he made OPEC, because he now owned, he is OPEC.
[01:28:08.693 --> 01:28:15.875]  He controlled OPEC that they could never go below $40 a barrel, and in his second term, if he won it, they were going to push it to $60,000.
[01:28:15.935 --> 01:28:16.515]  No, I know!
[01:28:16.575 --> 01:28:22.156]  Their own documents show they've jacked it up, and then they act like he's meeting with the Crown Prince to drive down prices.
[01:28:22.176 --> 01:28:23.477]  It's unbelievable.
[01:28:23.497 --> 01:28:23.857]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:28:23.917 --> 01:28:25.757]  And that's the charade people have.
[01:28:25.777 --> 01:28:27.578]  We're going to show in the film how that works.
[01:28:27.638 --> 01:28:32.699]  Alright, BillyJack.com, Tom Laughlin, I want to get you back on for a full hour soon.
[01:28:33.039 --> 01:28:33.899]  As soon as you can.
[01:28:33.959 --> 01:28:34.860]  We're rolling.
[01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:36.080]  We're ready to fight now.
[01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:37.241]  God bless you, sir.
[01:28:37.261 --> 01:28:37.722]  Take care.
[01:28:37.842 --> 01:28:38.143]  Bless you.
[01:28:38.183 --> 01:28:40.586]  And Alex, God bless you for fighting all these years.
[01:28:40.706 --> 01:28:41.587]  God bless you, man.
[01:28:41.628 --> 01:28:42.749]  You're a real patriot.
[01:28:42.769 --> 01:28:43.350]  Thank you, sir.
[01:28:44.151 --> 01:28:45.052]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.533 --> 01:28:47.155]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.175 --> 01:28:50.740]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:56.115 --> 01:29:01.620]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:02.041 --> 01:29:06.265]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:29:06.505 --> 01:29:13.552]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:13.932 --> 01:29:20.038]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:20.178 --> 01:29:21.399]  There are no side effects.
[01:29:21.719 --> 01:29:24.683]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:29:24.824 --> 01:29:26.846]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.

[01:29:55.553 --> 01:29:59.614]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:29:59.794 --> 01:30:02.676]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:02.756 --> 01:30:09.478]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:09.658 --> 01:30:12.660]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:12.860 --> 01:30:15.261]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:15.381 --> 01:30:23.284]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[01:30:23.984 --> 01:30:25.585]  Benzene, Chloride, and Chloroform.
[01:30:25.745 --> 01:30:26.486]  MTBE.

[01:30:29.748 --> 01:30:34.872]  Even nitrates and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.

[01:32:12.913 --> 01:32:13.493]  from 3 a.m.
[01:32:13.513 --> 01:32:14.214]  to 6 a.m.
[01:32:14.234 --> 01:32:25.963]  so four times a day you can hear the transmission against tyranny it's not about left or right it's about right and wrong and we are seeing the greatest manifestation of tyranny the world has ever seen right now
[01:32:27.209 --> 01:32:28.190]  And I mean it when I say it.
[01:32:28.230 --> 01:32:32.012]  If the neocons have their way, it's going to dwarf Hitler and Stalin.
[01:32:32.653 --> 01:32:35.614]  We're about to go to an amazing author, researcher.
[01:32:35.734 --> 01:32:37.135]  It was just on C-SPAN last weekend.
[01:32:37.155 --> 01:32:39.136]  It's going to be re-aired again this weekend.
[01:32:39.156 --> 01:32:41.218]  David Ray Griffin about his two powerful books.
[01:32:41.798 --> 01:32:45.620]  We'll have him for a full hour, hopefully even longer if he can spare us so we can take some calls.
[01:32:47.230 --> 01:32:55.454]  We got cut short in that last segment with Tom Laughlin, who of course is, in his own right, a legendary independent filmmaker, the highest grossing independent film ever.
[01:32:55.794 --> 01:33:01.276]  Now he's going to make a new Billy Jack film, but it's going to be a huge trial, basically, exposing Lord Bush.
[01:33:01.556 --> 01:33:08.540]  During the break we were talking, when I was about to say farewell, and you said that people don't know that we can win, people don't know that we can take action.
[01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:13.662]  In 60 seconds, please tell the listeners what you told me, because it's so true.
[01:33:14.162 --> 01:33:14.682]  Exactly.
[01:33:14.762 --> 01:33:18.244]  People are afraid, people are terrified, and people believe it's impossible.
[01:33:18.624 --> 01:33:28.688]  We took a survey of 247 people, 53% who were Republicans and voted for Bush, and asked if they believed we should impeach Bush and Cheney.
[01:33:29.088 --> 01:33:32.910]  Only 11 said yes, 236 were opposed.
[01:33:33.230 --> 01:33:40.133]  We then presented the evidence you can see on our website, and we're going to take these full-page ads giving, and once people saw these evidence,
[01:33:40.753 --> 01:33:45.976]  221 of them changed their minds and demanded Bush and Cheney be impeached now.
[01:33:46.457 --> 01:33:54.522]  Remember, Clinton was impeached only because of a major grassroots movement that forced the Republican Senate, who didn't want to touch that issue.
[01:33:54.742 --> 01:33:55.842]  Yeah, they tried to protect him.
[01:33:55.862 --> 01:33:56.603]  They're going to do it.
[01:33:57.343 --> 01:34:00.425]  Alright, well, billysack.com, thank you so much for joining us, Tom.
[01:34:00.945 --> 01:34:03.267]  And by the way, say hello to David Ray.
[01:34:03.327 --> 01:34:06.589]  Tell him he's a hero for what he knew about Pearl Harbor and said.
[01:34:07.330 --> 01:34:13.312]  All right, well, David is on with you right now, so we're going to transfer him over in a minute and get him on air.
[01:34:13.392 --> 01:34:14.433]  Thank you for coming on, Tom.
[01:34:14.633 --> 01:34:14.853]  Great.
[01:34:14.933 --> 01:34:15.553]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:34:15.593 --> 01:34:17.854]  Thanks for having me, and I'll look forward to chatting more.
[01:34:18.074 --> 01:34:18.575]  God bless.
[01:34:18.615 --> 01:34:19.635]  Boy, he's a riveting guy.
[01:34:19.655 --> 01:34:21.016]  I got a chance to talk to him during the breaks.
[01:34:21.296 --> 01:34:22.536]  He knows what he's talking about, too.
[01:34:23.617 --> 01:34:25.998]  Okay, now joining us is David Ray Griffin.
[01:34:27.058 --> 01:34:27.918]  He's a professor and
[01:34:30.996 --> 01:34:34.539]  Hi Alex, I've learned a lot from your show about 9-11 and other things, so I'm very glad to be on.
[01:34:53.078 --> 01:34:53.858]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:34:54.678 --> 01:34:55.138]  It's an honor.
[01:34:55.439 --> 01:34:56.919]  I've read your new Pearl Harbor.
[01:34:56.939 --> 01:35:00.860]  I haven't read your new 9-11 Commission report.
[01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:04.040]  But I did get a chance to see you on C-SPAN this weekend.
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:07.921]  For those that don't know who you are, tell us in a nutshell who David Ray Griffin is.
[01:35:09.081 --> 01:35:15.343]  Well, I've just retired from teaching Philosophy of Religion and Theology at the School of Theology at Claremont.
[01:35:15.423 --> 01:35:19.924]  So I've been teaching for some thirty-some years.
[01:35:22.747 --> 01:35:25.509]  I've written books on all sorts of topics.
[01:35:26.649 --> 01:35:34.735]  It was the first book on 9-11, The New Pearl Harbor, which was my first strongly political book.
[01:35:36.096 --> 01:35:37.757]  Well, it's a powerful book.
[01:35:37.777 --> 01:35:39.138]  Tell us about the new book.
[01:35:40.198 --> 01:35:48.144]  The new book is called The 9-11 Commission Report, Omissions and Distortions, and that's kind of a mild
[01:35:48.729 --> 01:36:00.760]  Subtitle, I could have just called it a 567 page lie, because when you get into it, it's just incredible the things they omit.
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:02.141]  Well, it's also contradictory.
[01:36:03.342 --> 01:36:12.610]  And self-contradictory, and most of all, contradicts all sorts of other facts, including what NORAD had been telling us for almost three years.
[01:36:13.385 --> 01:36:16.086]  Now, again, you went over this on C-SPAN last weekend.
[01:36:16.106 --> 01:36:20.728]  I've been told that your hour talk and 30 minutes of questions is going to be re-aired this Saturday?
[01:36:21.728 --> 01:36:22.348]  That's right.
[01:36:22.408 --> 01:36:25.109]  It'll be this Saturday at 2.30 Eastern Time.
[01:36:27.546 --> 01:36:33.409]  All right, David, I agree with everything you were saying in what I think was a kindly presentation.
[01:36:33.429 --> 01:36:39.553]  You could have been a lot more vicious, but you very, in a very calm way, presented the three different views of 9-11.
[01:36:39.593 --> 01:36:47.798]  And I got from what you were saying in your books that, I mean, clearly you're resting, and I want to put words in your mouth, leaning towards the third.
[01:36:48.638 --> 01:36:49.899]  That's where all the evidence points.
[01:36:50.899 --> 01:36:55.322]  But something, I want to cover this first off, you know, out of the gates here.
[01:36:55.862 --> 01:36:57.303]  The first thing you covered,
[01:36:58.468 --> 01:37:04.110]  Uh, at the end of your major presentation about ways to deal with this was a world democracy.
[01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:11.753]  And I've seen UN documents and globalist documents going back ten years where they say the people are going to wake up to the
[01:37:12.569 --> 01:37:20.156]  to the Anglo-American establishment, which is now run by the neocons, England and the US, this power axis, and so we've got to give them a choice.
[01:37:20.216 --> 01:37:28.163]  We'll give them a UN, quote, liberal choice, but then I look at who owns and controls the UN and the agencies that fund it and control it.
[01:37:28.443 --> 01:37:29.764]  It's the same corporations.
[01:37:29.784 --> 01:37:31.205]  They're playing good cop, bad cop.
[01:37:31.526 --> 01:37:36.730]  You didn't elaborate on that, but I want to get your exact view on that so I understand it.
[01:37:37.871 --> 01:37:39.233]  Yeah, well, my view is
[01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:43.723]  I'm not talking about just strengthening the UN.
[01:37:45.704 --> 01:37:54.310]  And I should say, you know, my focus now is on 9-11 and the American Empire and trying to get the truth out about these things.
[01:37:55.011 --> 01:38:02.236]  The question of what's the alternative is a very important question and that's what I'm going to address in my future books.
[01:38:02.296 --> 01:38:08.921]  Let me just say very briefly what I have in mind is, you know, we're all in favor of democracy.
[01:38:09.369 --> 01:38:12.110]  But we mean real democracy, not plutocracy.
[01:38:12.210 --> 01:38:21.612]  So we mean a real democracy where money doesn't determine the votes, but just the people's basic values and wishes.
[01:38:22.232 --> 01:38:33.634]  So the idea of global democracy is simply that if democracy is the right form of government for a nation, why shouldn't it be the right form of order for the world as a whole, so that the people of the world
[01:38:34.522 --> 01:38:44.406]  can start directing their own affairs and taking care of their planet rather than having uh... one nation dictating or at most seven nations dictating the global economy.
[01:38:44.426 --> 01:39:00.152]  Yeah, the G7, G8, but let's elaborate on that for a second then we'll get into 9-11 because that's why you're here but in your talk you crowned it with what we're now discussing so we need to kind of extrapolate here and and and and to get to the bottom of it if you're talking about an alliance of free nation states
[01:39:02.373 --> 01:39:16.302]  Through mutual treaties together, standing up against, of the 100 biggest economies, 45 of them are corporations as you know, if you're talking about the people banding together against this powerful power block, then I agree with you.
[01:39:16.362 --> 01:39:26.769]  But if it's some fake left maneuver through the UN, that's going to be a false flag, a false savior, good cop, bad cop operation.
[01:39:26.789 --> 01:39:29.871]  And I've read the Globalist saying that's part of their plan, David.
[01:39:30.391 --> 01:39:31.832]  And so, that's what I'm getting at here.
[01:39:32.153 --> 01:39:41.080]  Well, you know, there are different globalists, and there's the so-called globalization from above, which is what you're rightly worried about.
[01:39:42.181 --> 01:39:48.526]  And then there's what many people call globalization from below, which is really what democracy would be.
[01:39:50.668 --> 01:39:57.974]  But I say, you know, these are very complex issues, which my book on this is going to be a very long and complex book in which I
[01:39:58.652 --> 01:40:07.256]  Do lay out what I hold, but most basically, I think what we need now is to see that we need to move to a democratic world.
[01:40:10.263 --> 01:40:15.507]  And then there'll be all sorts of debates about what's the proper, what's the best means.
[01:40:15.587 --> 01:40:17.028]  But I agree with the Founding Fathers.
[01:40:17.088 --> 01:40:21.971]  I'm not for a pure democracy because 51% could say all blacks are slaves.
[01:40:22.391 --> 01:40:32.958]  I'm for a republic system where you have a Bill of Rights and you look at Article 30 and 31 of the UN Charter, it erases the previous 29 rights that sound wonderful.
[01:40:33.238 --> 01:40:35.520]  So that's, that's what I'm talking about being a threat.
[01:40:36.346 --> 01:41:05.042]  Well, and that's absolutely essential, and I would think we would have, it would have to be what we would call a modified democracy, that is, the kind that we have, and I would advocate that we would have a global bill of rights and responsibilities, and in my C-SPAN lecture I was emphasizing the fact that beneath all the differences of the various religions and cultural traditions,
[01:41:05.874 --> 01:41:16.509]  There is a set of basic universal human values that we all do share and that they're diametrically opposed to the
[01:41:17.594 --> 01:41:19.655]  The values of the global plutocracy.
[01:41:19.695 --> 01:41:31.801]  But the globalists are using the media they own to warp our values and literally give us what I would call satanic world values of do-as-thou-will predatory system where we all feed on each other.
[01:41:32.001 --> 01:41:33.081]  That's absolutely right.
[01:41:33.121 --> 01:41:45.567]  In fact, I have as a theologian, I use the term the demonic to refer to this kind of values that have been dominating us increasingly and the
[01:41:47.065 --> 01:41:47.626]  In the world.
[01:41:48.466 --> 01:42:01.753]  And so, what I would be talking about would be a form of global order that would be diametrically opposed to that kind of globalism that you're rightly opposed to.
[01:42:01.773 --> 01:42:05.935]  So you're saying this global system, though, wouldn't force, quote, a rogue nation to join it?
[01:42:06.996 --> 01:42:09.877]  Well, I'd say there are all sorts of difficult questions.
[01:42:09.897 --> 01:42:10.698]  But I'm asking you.
[01:42:11.218 --> 01:42:14.160]  Well, I have not even finished my book on this.
[01:42:15.399 --> 01:42:19.862]  I'll be very glad to come back and talk about it when I've worked out my ideas on it.
[01:42:20.383 --> 01:42:30.970]  Right now I'm still focusing on 9-11 and the... Would you like me to send you UN and Ex-Im Bank and IMF decade-old plans to give people a false left choice?
[01:42:31.911 --> 01:42:35.353]  Sure, I'm interested to get all the information I can.
[01:42:35.634 --> 01:42:38.796]  Alright, well I appreciate you letting me diatribe on that subject.
[01:42:38.856 --> 01:42:44.120]  It's just that, David, I think you've done a fabulous job exposing 9-11, but if we take that energy
[01:42:46.232 --> 01:42:55.235]  I have said from the day of 9-11, of course two months before 9-11, I said they'd use Bin Laden to take the blame, who's their agent, when the military industrial complex attacks the World Trade Center.
[01:42:56.095 --> 01:43:04.498]  And then day one I went on air and said they did it, and I took all the heat for it, and I've since seen other people rise up and then try to limit the debate, which I know you've never done.
[01:43:05.038 --> 01:43:06.979]  I commend you for
[01:43:08.323 --> 01:43:28.799]  You know, looking at all views, but I did warn people that the truth of 9-11 would be allowed out into Europe and the rest of the world as a way to demonize America, and I want to point out the neocons themselves are nothing but a capo regime for a larger global mafia, and they're letting their minions take all the blame for it.
[01:43:33.271 --> 01:43:45.194]  Yeah, I'd say there's much going on behind the scenes that the people are not allowed to see, and certainly the mainstream media doesn't do much to give us a glimpse of that.
[01:43:45.214 --> 01:44:00.579]  Alright, let's get into your presentation in kind of a condensed form, if you would be so kind, sir, of what you did on C-SPAN, because I think it's a good argument, a technique, just with the facts, that I found to be extremely effective and powerful.
[01:44:02.070 --> 01:44:09.915]  Well, with regard to American Empire, I pointed out that there are two basic ideas anymore.
[01:44:09.935 --> 01:44:13.377]  There's no longer debate whether there is an American Empire.
[01:44:13.437 --> 01:44:14.437]  That was the old debate.
[01:44:14.477 --> 01:44:18.339]  But now it's just, is it benign or not benign?
[01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:30.366]  And you have, of course, a powerful majority arguing that, of course, we're an empire, but we're the first benign empire in history, most magnanimous.
[01:44:31.088 --> 01:44:35.969]  Because what we're doing is going out trying to bring freedom and democracy and human rights to the world.
[01:44:36.049 --> 01:44:37.289]  But every empire says that!
[01:44:38.190 --> 01:44:39.830]  Every empire has said that.
[01:44:40.630 --> 01:44:44.651]  We just have much more mass media to communicate our message.
[01:44:45.611 --> 01:44:56.813]  Then I argued that with 9-11 there are four basic views and of course which view you hold will have a great effect on what you think about the American empire.
[01:44:56.873 --> 01:44:59.534]  The first view of course is the official view that
[01:45:00.839 --> 01:45:09.164]  That 19 Muslims out-tricked our trillion-dollar defense system and they were able to bring down three buildings.
[01:45:09.244 --> 01:45:15.607]  First time in history steel frame high-rise buildings have ever been brought down apart from controlled demolition.
[01:45:16.708 --> 01:45:18.409]  So these guys were very bright.
[01:45:18.489 --> 01:45:19.790]  That's the official story.
[01:45:20.870 --> 01:45:29.015]  Second view is that, well, that was right, but what we mean by 9-11 is really the fact the United States
[01:45:30.135 --> 01:45:34.396]  used it opportunistically to advance the American Empire.
[01:45:35.616 --> 01:45:58.742]  The third view is that the official story is more false because we actually the US agencies knew in advance that the attacks were going to occur and deliberately let them occur in order to advance the American Empire and that also includes of course the pretext for passing the Patriot Act and
[01:45:59.816 --> 01:46:01.957]  And other domestic policies.
[01:46:02.537 --> 01:46:12.961]  And then finally, the fourth view is that yes, they did have foreign knowledge, but the main reason they had foreign knowledge is that they actually planned and orchestrated and carried out the events.
[01:46:13.121 --> 01:46:14.322]  Oh, so it's four views.
[01:46:14.402 --> 01:46:15.882]  My memory failed me.
[01:46:16.403 --> 01:46:24.005]  Which view, Mr. Griffin, on the record do you believe is, with all the evidence, which view do you think is probably what happened?
[01:46:25.046 --> 01:46:27.147]  Well, as I said on the air,
[01:46:28.464 --> 01:46:43.331]  There is considerable evidence for the third view, but there is even more evidence, and of course that doesn't contradict the third view evidence, for the fourth view, so that there are just so many things about what happened 9-11.
[01:46:43.391 --> 01:46:46.113]  It could only be that they ran the whole operation.
[01:46:46.533 --> 01:46:53.136]  That's right, and for people who haven't heard this before, and of course that wouldn't be many people listening to your show,
[01:46:53.908 --> 01:47:02.568]  But other people, they immediately say, oh, that's outrageous, that's impermissible, you're going beyond the bounds of civilized speech, and so on.
[01:47:03.303 --> 01:47:05.344]  And give all these a priori arguments.
[01:47:05.424 --> 01:47:06.905]  Our own government wouldn't do that.
[01:47:06.925 --> 01:47:07.705]  They're emotional.
[01:47:07.745 --> 01:47:08.646]  That just couldn't be.
[01:47:09.426 --> 01:47:10.307]  That's impossible.
[01:47:10.647 --> 01:47:15.990]  So, all I ask is that people will not dismiss it out of hand.
[01:47:16.130 --> 01:47:18.891]  Well, we have the official government documents over and over again.
[01:47:18.911 --> 01:47:19.832]  We have Gladio.
[01:47:20.072 --> 01:47:21.092]  We have Northwoods.
[01:47:21.432 --> 01:47:25.114]  We have where the government admits they carry out terror attacks.
[01:47:25.474 --> 01:47:25.975]  That's right.
[01:47:26.015 --> 01:47:29.697]  But again, most people are not informed about that.
[01:47:29.737 --> 01:47:31.738]  You probably wouldn't find
[01:47:32.682 --> 01:47:38.907]  More than one or two people in a hundred who would know about Operation Northwood.
[01:47:38.987 --> 01:47:42.269]  And that's after three and a half, four years of us harping on it.
[01:47:42.289 --> 01:47:43.570]  That's right.
[01:47:43.631 --> 01:47:47.073]  Vanford's book came out about that long ago.
[01:47:47.093 --> 01:47:48.114]  Yeah, it came out in early 2001.
[01:47:48.154 --> 01:47:48.975]  Yeah.
[01:47:51.316 --> 01:47:52.337]  It's unbelievable.
[01:47:52.938 --> 01:48:00.884]  So, I mean, we can't blame the people for holding these views because insofar as they
[01:48:01.764 --> 01:48:02.546]  I don't know.
[01:48:13.317 --> 01:48:16.959]  Such as yours and many others that give an alternative view.
[01:48:16.979 --> 01:48:21.701]  I want to get more into 9-11, but right now I want to bring this up to you.
[01:48:22.281 --> 01:48:30.625]  I know the globalists did it, I know they executed it, and I know they're arrogant right now because they're going to do it again real soon unless we expose who's behind it, then they lose their motive.
[01:48:31.245 --> 01:48:33.747]  I think that the next attack is going to be much bigger.
[01:48:33.907 --> 01:48:36.808]  I don't put it past the globalists, but that made a nuke in this country.
[01:48:37.705 --> 01:48:39.445]  I don't put it past them to release smallpox.
[01:48:39.965 --> 01:48:45.886]  I see the same pre-positioning and pre-programming going on in the media right now that I saw before 9-11.
[01:48:46.507 --> 01:48:51.827]  And I think we're in a race to shift the paradigm and then they may back off.
[01:48:51.887 --> 01:48:52.428]  What do you think?
[01:48:54.928 --> 01:49:06.910]  Well, I'm afraid you're right that when they need another big surge and as the present regime gets more and more unpopular, the appeal is always to fear and we will protect you.
[01:49:07.719 --> 01:49:14.863]  So, I'm afraid you're quite likely right that they're at least seriously considering it.
[01:49:15.504 --> 01:49:25.890]  Whether there's anything that we can do, whether we can inform enough people in time to make them back off, it would be hard to know.
[01:49:25.910 --> 01:49:28.351]  We're in a race, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:28.391 --> 01:49:30.532]  David Ray Griffin, I really appreciate him coming along with us.
[01:49:30.552 --> 01:49:31.833]  He's going to be with us into the next hour.
[01:49:31.853 --> 01:49:34.555]  We'll tell you how to get his fine books as well.
[01:49:35.814 --> 01:49:36.635]  So stay with us.
[01:49:36.676 --> 01:49:43.065]  We'll return and we'll have time to take some of your calls as well for David Ray Griffin later in the next hour.
[01:49:43.085 --> 01:49:43.145]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:49:43.165 --> 01:49:44.828]  My website, by the way, is InfoWars.com.
[01:49:44.868 --> 01:49:46.150]  The other is PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:49:53.883 --> 01:50:00.728]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:01.028 --> 01:50:02.409]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.610 --> 01:50:04.811]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:04.971 --> 01:50:07.073]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:07.333 --> 01:50:12.277]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:12.597 --> 01:50:16.640]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:18.660]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:29.382]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.522 --> 01:50:31.423]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:50:31.623 --> 01:50:35.503]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns of the info war.
[01:50:35.583 --> 01:50:37.144]  Order right now by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:50:37.164 --> 01:50:37.504]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:50:44.005 --> 01:50:47.694]  Or order online at InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net.
[01:50:47.935 --> 01:50:48.657]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[01:50:53.388 --> 01:50:58.610]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:58.750 --> 01:51:06.853]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:07.093 --> 01:51:14.155]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:14.335 --> 01:51:15.616]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[01:51:15.696 --> 01:51:21.600]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:21.780 --> 01:51:26.884]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:26.984 --> 01:51:35.870]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[01:51:36.130 --> 01:51:39.433]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:51:41.514 --> 01:51:45.557]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:52:02.869 --> 01:52:09.214]  We provide outstanding products like ECAC, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:52:09.534 --> 01:52:10.195]  We're good to go!
[01:52:39.073 --> 01:52:42.155]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:42.315 --> 01:52:48.258]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:53.562 --> 01:52:55.463]  Social architects, business,
[01:53:09.463 --> 01:53:10.843]  Is manipulating society.
[01:53:11.484 --> 01:53:15.545]  By doing that, they control the factories, the people, the environment, everything.
[01:53:15.585 --> 01:53:20.486]  That's their business, is manipulating, giving you false choices, and scaring you into submission.
[01:53:20.706 --> 01:53:25.068]  And 9-11 was so sloppy, I believe it's actually meant to come out.
[01:53:26.008 --> 01:53:26.928]  And then to be spun.
[01:53:28.289 --> 01:53:30.309]  But regardless, we've got to expose it.
[01:53:31.310 --> 01:53:32.690]  And we are going to expose it.
[01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:37.163]  And I hope you'll get my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:53:37.503 --> 01:53:41.306]  It dwarfs my previous films, and they're among some of the best, according to the reviews.
[01:53:42.507 --> 01:53:59.340]  It's three hours long, it is a mini-series, it covers the police state, an hour on 9-11, and an hour on the Bush, Nazi, Schwarzenegger, IBM, Connection, and the Order of Death, and their philosophy, that Luciferian, demonic philosophy.
[01:54:00.370 --> 01:54:01.511]  That's really what drives them.
[01:54:01.551 --> 01:54:02.953]  And that's why this is a groundbreaking film.
[01:54:02.973 --> 01:54:05.195]  Because we just went where the news took us.
[01:54:05.235 --> 01:54:07.658]  And it really is spiritual at the end of the day.
[01:54:08.419 --> 01:54:09.680]  So I hope you'll get this new film.
[01:54:09.700 --> 01:54:11.322]  I mean it's produced very high quality.
[01:54:11.382 --> 01:54:12.763]  It was shot on big TV cameras.
[01:54:13.124 --> 01:54:14.105]  And of course on handheld.
[01:54:14.765 --> 01:54:17.028]  In the field, live action, interspersed with documents.
[01:54:18.089 --> 01:54:21.913]  At the RNC is the backdrop for all the information that comes out.
[01:54:22.807 --> 01:54:28.151]  1-888-253-3139 is the toll free number to call.

[01:54:45.742 --> 01:54:46.803]  Dozens of other films.
[01:54:47.203 --> 01:54:48.244]  My weekly TV show.
[01:54:49.239 --> 01:54:50.580]  Hundreds of audio interviews.
[01:54:50.660 --> 01:54:51.761]  You'll see this one posted there.
[01:54:52.082 --> 01:54:53.122]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:54:53.443 --> 01:54:57.006]  David Ray Griffin, how do people get your book or your books?
[01:54:57.066 --> 01:54:58.707]  I've seen them in some bookstores.
[01:54:59.087 --> 01:55:00.068]  Or is there a website?
[01:55:00.108 --> 01:55:01.669]  How should we get your books?
[01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:04.051]  Well, there are lots of ways.
[01:55:04.271 --> 01:55:07.614]  As we like to say, you can get them at good bookstores everywhere.
[01:55:08.275 --> 01:55:13.219]  But also, you can go on to interlinkbooks.com
[01:55:15.832 --> 01:55:32.443]  Or you can go to Amazon.com and if you look under the second book, the 9-11 Commission Report, Omissions and Distortions, you'll see an almost two-for-one offer where you can get two, both books for almost the price of one.
[01:55:32.923 --> 01:55:38.367]  Alright, so the two books of the New Pearl Harbor and the 9-11 Commission Report
[01:55:39.556 --> 01:55:40.917]  And what's the full title?
[01:55:41.257 --> 01:55:43.878]  Yeah, the subtitle is Omissions and Distortions.
[01:55:44.019 --> 01:55:45.960]  I was sent a copy, but I didn't bring it to the office today.
[01:55:45.980 --> 01:55:46.600]  I apologize.
[01:55:47.260 --> 01:55:48.701]  David, let's continue.
[01:55:48.721 --> 01:55:50.122]  We're going to go into the next hour.
[01:55:50.522 --> 01:55:53.303]  What are some of the issues you want to discuss concerning 9-11?
[01:55:53.583 --> 01:55:56.625]  I mean, I want to focus in on the fourth part and the evidence for that.
[01:55:56.665 --> 01:55:57.185]  Is that okay?
[01:55:57.465 --> 01:55:57.766]  Sure.
[01:55:58.466 --> 01:56:00.707]  Let's go ahead and start getting into the fourth view on 9-11.
[01:56:00.747 --> 01:56:01.207]  Okay, well, there is
[01:56:07.133 --> 01:56:16.559]  There are several parts of the story that simply cannot be explained, apart from it being, at least partly, an inside job.
[01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:21.142]  One of those, of course, is the collapse of the towers.
[01:56:21.582 --> 01:56:29.447]  And as your listeners know, steel-frame high-rise buildings have never come down in the history of this universe.
[01:56:31.289 --> 01:56:36.451]  Solely because of fire or because of fire and the impact of the planes.
[01:56:36.591 --> 01:56:39.292]  And of course, Building 7 didn't have any plane hit it.
[01:56:40.953 --> 01:56:52.478]  Furthermore, when you look, you know, people come up with these scenarios of how these buildings might have come down and they allege they were poorly built with weak trusses and all that.
[01:56:53.238 --> 01:56:54.578]  And of course, that's all false.
[01:56:55.199 --> 01:56:58.000]  But even if one could could
[01:56:58.999 --> 01:57:01.060]  Countenance, the pancake theory.
[01:57:01.701 --> 01:57:07.485]  With the Twin Towers, you've still got those enormous steel columns.
[01:57:07.825 --> 01:57:12.528]  Massive steel columns that constituted the major weight-bearing part.
[01:57:13.769 --> 01:57:15.990]  And the 9-11 report just says those didn't exist.
[01:57:16.191 --> 01:57:16.811]  That's right.
[01:57:16.851 --> 01:57:19.633]  That's one of the two or three biggest lies.
[01:57:19.733 --> 01:57:25.377]  As they say, most of the weight was borne by the exterior columns and the
[01:57:26.345 --> 01:57:32.729]  The core of their buildings consisted of a hollow steel shaft just filled with elevators and stairwells.
[01:57:34.130 --> 01:57:39.153]  So they denied the most distinctive thing about those buildings when they were built.
[01:57:39.353 --> 01:57:40.914]  Stay there, we're gonna start the third hour.
[01:57:50.280 --> 01:57:50.881]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.580 --> 01:57:52.641]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.341 --> 01:57:54.461]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.101 --> 01:57:55.922]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.682 --> 01:57:57.582]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.243 --> 01:58:01.924]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.424 --> 01:58:06.566]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:15.169 --> 01:58:18.671]  David Wright Griffin, author, professor,
[01:58:20.049 --> 01:58:26.672]  Expert on 9-11 will be with us for about 40 minutes into this hour, so we have plenty of time to talk about 9-11 and take your calls.
[01:58:27.272 --> 01:58:34.535]  Then we've got another guest joining us at about 45 after, a little mini guest, but very important information, so stay with us for that.
[01:58:34.915 --> 01:58:36.216]  And I've got some other news here.
[01:58:37.036 --> 01:58:42.722]  Uh, that I want to, uh, get, uh, David Ray Griffin's opinion on because it all ties in to 9-11.
[01:58:43.303 --> 01:58:47.367]  Coming up here in about 15 minutes, we will start taking your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:47.427 --> 01:58:56.256]  And, uh, we've got, uh, a lot of callers that are already holding, so again we'll be getting to those quite soon.
[01:58:57.223 --> 01:58:59.284]  There's four views on 9-11.
[01:58:59.324 --> 01:59:04.227]  I think David Ray Griffin has really said that properly when he stated that.
[01:59:04.607 --> 01:59:05.887]  We've gone over the four views.
[01:59:06.248 --> 01:59:09.149]  The fourth view is that the government was basically purely behind her.
[01:59:09.189 --> 01:59:11.270]  Criminal elements of it orchestrated it.
[01:59:11.590 --> 01:59:18.754]  And as he said, the predominant evidence, the majority of the totally documented evidence, it all points and supports that.
[01:59:19.414 --> 01:59:21.335]  As I've been saying since day one of September 11th.
[01:59:23.323 --> 01:59:27.406]  Let's continue with part four in describing the evidence.
[01:59:27.426 --> 01:59:30.589]  You were talking about the collapse of the towers.
[01:59:31.829 --> 01:59:32.730]  Well, yes.
[01:59:32.790 --> 01:59:39.495]  The towers have at least ten characteristics of controlled demolition.
[01:59:39.595 --> 01:59:49.363]  That is, where explosives are precisely placed throughout the buildings in order to bring them down in a way that they don't topple over all the buildings around them.
[01:59:49.383 --> 01:59:52.165]  I mean, if those buildings had come down
[01:59:53.194 --> 02:00:01.279]  Some other way, they would have killed, you know, hundreds of thousands of people and destroyed much of lower Manhattan.
[02:00:01.999 --> 02:00:06.962]  So it was very important that they be brought down straight down as in controlled demolition.
[02:00:07.082 --> 02:00:13.006]  And anybody who's looked at the websites that have these can see that all three buildings do exactly that.
[02:00:13.686 --> 02:00:16.608]  There is no other way that such buildings can come down.
[02:00:16.848 --> 02:00:21.732]  If your building was owned by Larry Silverstein with a double insurance policy, it was totally destroyed.
[02:00:21.752 --> 02:00:23.653]  But if it wasn't, it got light damage.
[02:00:24.614 --> 02:00:27.276]  That did seem to be an interesting coincidence, didn't it?
[02:00:28.056 --> 02:00:31.099]  And then he says that they pulled Building 7, but we're supposed to ignore that.
[02:00:32.039 --> 02:00:42.427]  Yeah, and then as was revealed on your show, Giuliani says he knew ahead of time that the towers were going to come down.
[02:00:43.140 --> 02:00:49.066]  How in the world could anybody have known ahead of time, because as I say, that has never happened before.
[02:00:49.507 --> 02:00:57.335]  There would have been no reason to predict the towers would have come down, and as you stressed on your show, the firemen going up the South Tower
[02:00:58.911 --> 02:01:02.532]  You know, we're very calm and thought they had the fire under control.
[02:01:02.592 --> 02:01:06.213]  There was not a thought in anybody's mind that the towers might collapse.
[02:01:06.513 --> 02:01:14.674]  We had the initial plane set, the jet fuel burns, catches some low-burning fires, wouldn't even get near melting steel, then it almost completely burned out.
[02:01:15.335 --> 02:01:25.897]  In the North Tower, people are hanging out the windows, wouldn't melt their flesh, but it'll melt four-foot-around steel-reinforced beams sprayed with asbestos to protect them.
[02:01:25.957 --> 02:01:26.717]  It's ridiculous!
[02:01:27.606 --> 02:01:52.600]  And even more ridiculous is the story about the South Tower, because, as you know, a good deal of the fuel burned outside and created that enormous fireball that was great for TV effects, but that meant there was very little fuel left to feed the fire inside, and therefore the fire in the South Tower was burning down
[02:01:53.636 --> 02:01:54.597]  Even more quickly.
[02:01:54.677 --> 02:01:59.559]  Well, the firefighters reported two small fires in that building.
[02:01:59.599 --> 02:02:18.888]  Yeah, and in building, and that's true of building 7, where the pictures that we have from various locations show that there were fires only on the 7th and 12th floors of that massive 47-story building, and they want to tell us that... And the Commission doesn't even mention that building.
[02:02:19.486 --> 02:02:22.769]  No, uh, the, uh... It's like it's a bug somebody stepped on.
[02:02:22.809 --> 02:02:23.429]  Doesn't even count.
[02:02:23.509 --> 02:02:27.793]  Yeah, so that's one of the things I have in mind when I say omissions and distortions.
[02:02:27.953 --> 02:02:31.075]  So these omissions are enormous omissions.
[02:02:31.375 --> 02:02:35.579]  The fact that they wouldn't even mention the Building 7, uh, collapsed.
[02:02:35.879 --> 02:02:43.825]  I want to get more into how the Commission put out false diagrams of the buildings when we get back, and then continue with our gasoline recalls.
[02:02:45.804 --> 02:02:50.129]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:50.309 --> 02:02:54.754]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:54.874 --> 02:02:59.259]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:59.299 --> 02:03:00.661]  The New World Order.
[02:03:01.561 --> 02:03:02.542]  Animer.
[02:03:02.562 --> 02:03:06.666]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.726 --> 02:03:13.673]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:13.793 --> 02:03:15.795]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:16.175 --> 02:03:26.622]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:26.782 --> 02:03:32.206]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:03:45.274 --> 02:03:48.536]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:03:48.596 --> 02:03:52.798]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:03:53.018 --> 02:03:55.819]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:03:55.999 --> 02:03:58.401]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:03:58.601 --> 02:04:07.245]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:04:07.425 --> 02:04:08.786]  The Berkeley Light is different.
[02:04:08.966 --> 02:04:13.148]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:04:13.468 --> 02:04:13.989]  We're good to go!
[02:04:44.969 --> 02:04:46.110]  Why do you wear watches?
[02:04:46.410 --> 02:04:48.991]  The answer is no longer simply to tell time.
[02:04:49.451 --> 02:04:57.035]  At DiscountWatchStore.com, watches are as much about telling time as they are about making a fashion statement or showing off one's success.
[02:04:57.396 --> 02:05:01.137]  Watches also make for great heirlooms to pass on for generations to come.
[02:05:01.598 --> 02:05:03.839]  As an authorized dealer of many fine watches,

[02:05:56.692 --> 02:05:57.572]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.592 --> 02:06:01.915]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.436 --> 02:06:06.539]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:06.559 --> 02:06:18.287]  8 minutes, 25 seconds into this third hour, David Ray Griffin, professor, author, lecturer, joins us, talking about the new Pearl Harbor,
[02:06:19.381 --> 02:06:22.242]  And the 9-11 whitewash the Commission engaged in.
[02:06:23.382 --> 02:06:23.842]  I love it!
[02:06:24.602 --> 02:06:27.623]  The Commission is appointed by George W. Bush.
[02:06:28.243 --> 02:06:32.204]  Half the Commission is in business with the Carlisle Group or the Bin Laden's directly.
[02:06:32.924 --> 02:06:42.906]  The head staffer is a minion of Condoleezza Rice and a chief neocon with connections to the 9-11 perpetrators.
[02:06:43.846 --> 02:06:52.514]  It's like when Janet Reno appointed John Danforth with two Justice Department aides as a Justice Department investigation to investigate herself on Waco.
[02:06:53.374 --> 02:06:54.575]  And they call it independent.
[02:06:54.595 --> 02:06:56.437]  I mean, it's just all bald-faced lies.
[02:06:57.218 --> 02:07:01.361]  We're talking about the fourth view of 9-11, that the globalists actually carried it out.
[02:07:01.902 --> 02:07:03.583]  The criminal cabal carried it out.
[02:07:04.784 --> 02:07:06.185]  We were going through the evidence of this.
[02:07:06.786 --> 02:07:09.188]  In the 9-11 report, which I did read, and it was
[02:07:10.174 --> 02:07:10.894]  It was torturous.
[02:07:10.914 --> 02:07:16.595]  I mean, it was so self-contradictory, it's like a low-grade moron wrote it.
[02:07:16.675 --> 02:07:22.797]  But again, they know 99.9% of people don't read these type of publications.
[02:07:23.477 --> 02:07:24.937]  I mean, it was laughable.
[02:07:25.037 --> 02:07:29.478]  I mean, I never even addressed it in any detail because it was too much to address.
[02:07:29.498 --> 02:07:34.499]  It was like telling me to, you know, shovel out a million horses' stalls or something.
[02:07:34.539 --> 02:07:34.979]  It was just an
[02:07:35.889 --> 02:07:40.071]  An impenetrable job of ham-fistedness.
[02:07:40.592 --> 02:07:56.800]  But they do stuff, as he's mentioned in there, as showing diagrams up on their big TV screens for the TV crews of, look, I have this on tape, there were no pillars here, this was all hollow, it was weakly built, and so that's why it fell.
[02:07:56.901 --> 02:08:04.024]  When these buildings were over-engineered, and we've read the reports by the Muruyama Saki, the designer,
[02:08:05.902 --> 02:08:09.366]  Articles he'd written, a major digest on architecture.
[02:08:10.608 --> 02:08:25.065]  All of this, the chief of construction for the building, who died on 9-11 in the buildings, of course, conveniently, saying it was meant to take multiple crashes from large jetliners.
[02:08:25.723 --> 02:08:28.685]  But, but, I mean, David Ray Griffin, I mean, I'm glad you brought this up on C-SPAN.
[02:08:29.025 --> 02:08:36.909]  They just say these pillars don't exist, and these other shows on TV, there's probably been ten of them about, well, why the towers fell.
[02:08:37.870 --> 02:08:40.491]  They all say that those pillars don't exist.
[02:08:40.932 --> 02:08:42.633]  I mean, it's really getting ridiculous.
[02:08:43.133 --> 02:08:55.300]  Well, they, they, you know, they have to deny their existence, even though, as any book about the World Trade Center, like James Glantz's book, Glantz and Lipton, of the New York Times,
[02:08:56.433 --> 02:09:07.460]  points out that when the World Trade Center towers were built that was a very distinctive design and it was very controversial and so there was an enormous amount of discussion about it.
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:21.428]  So now for the what I call the Kane-Zelikow report because that's most important to point out that the report was really the whole commission was run by and the report was
[02:09:23.014 --> 02:09:28.298]  finally formulated by Philip Zelikow, who is essentially a member of the Bush administration.
[02:09:28.318 --> 02:09:37.386]  I mean, it was just as if Dick Cheney had supervised the Commission's report on how well the White House did.
[02:09:37.406 --> 02:09:41.188]  So it's not independent at all.
[02:09:41.229 --> 02:09:43.250]  It's just an inside cover-up job.
[02:09:44.071 --> 02:09:48.854]  But that's so important because I use the analogy of the old 78 phonograph players.
[02:09:51.371 --> 02:09:57.434]  Sometimes the records would collapse, but you always still had that spindle sticking up the middle.
[02:09:58.275 --> 02:10:15.345]  Well, if the pancake theory about the towers even were plausible, the floors would have collapsed, but you still would have had those 47 spindles, those massive steel columns sticking several hundred feet up into the air.
[02:10:15.365 --> 02:10:19.547]  Well, I have a five-part series called New York on PBS.
[02:10:20.436 --> 02:10:26.303]  And an entire two hours of a five-part series is about the World Trade Center.
[02:10:27.404 --> 02:10:41.120]  And I have film from every angle, and then I brag about how no building had ever been built so strong, and no set of buildings, how huge these were, and it shows these giant pillars in the middle of the building.
[02:10:42.180 --> 02:10:43.280]  But I guess I'm insane!
[02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:44.161]  I'm with Al-Qaeda!
[02:10:44.621 --> 02:10:54.945]  Because if I went to a major university, which we've done, and went to their architecture department, where the building's always been studied, and pull that out, I'm insane!
[02:10:55.005 --> 02:10:56.865]  Those don't exist on the blueprints!
[02:10:57.626 --> 02:10:57.926]  David?
[02:10:59.906 --> 02:11:00.727]  I'm with Al-Qaeda!
[02:11:00.967 --> 02:11:03.588]  This is extreme revisionism.
[02:11:05.248 --> 02:11:16.936]  So, you know, the right usually complains about revisionist views of history and now they've pulled off the biggest revisionism probably of recent history to deny that.
[02:11:16.976 --> 02:11:22.540]  Let me give another example of the extreme lies, I mean the audacity of the lies in there.
[02:11:23.340 --> 02:11:30.745]  Before, this has to do with the flight number 93 in Pennsylvania and the question was it shot down?
[02:11:35.100 --> 02:11:42.382]  Well, so much evidence suggests it was shot down by our own government, but of course our government has denied it.
[02:11:43.502 --> 02:11:48.624]  Now, the 9-11 Commission report does not face any of that evidence, even though it's massive.
[02:11:48.664 --> 02:11:50.964]  They simply ignore it, as if it didn't exist.
[02:11:51.824 --> 02:12:01.427]  And then they try to get around it by saying, look, Cheney didn't give the shoot-down order until 10 minutes after, and that was four minutes or more
[02:12:02.276 --> 02:12:03.937]  Because it's on record he did this.
[02:12:03.997 --> 02:12:05.938]  Our ambassadors have even told foreign leaders.
[02:12:06.779 --> 02:12:09.161]  But since they have it on record, they just changed the time.
[02:12:09.501 --> 02:12:10.101]  That's right.
[02:12:10.361 --> 02:12:17.926]  And, you know, Richard Clark had reported that the shoot-down order was given about quarter till ten.
[02:12:18.467 --> 02:12:24.130]  And so there was plenty of time for the Air Force to track the plane and shoot it down.
[02:12:24.211 --> 02:12:28.133]  Even Wolfowitz said that we were on the tail and ready to shoot it down.
[02:12:28.814 --> 02:12:29.374]  Nevertheless,
[02:12:30.149 --> 02:12:35.171]  Even Cheney had said he was immediately hustled down shortly after the South Tower.
[02:12:35.191 --> 02:12:38.992]  And again, they shoot it down so within the Pentagon, people think they actually did something.
[02:12:39.172 --> 02:12:40.493]  This was part of the whole program?
[02:12:41.413 --> 02:12:44.935]  Well, you know, it is funny they didn't take credit for shooting it down.
[02:12:44.975 --> 02:12:48.316]  They could have said, see, we were trying to protect Washington.
[02:12:48.336 --> 02:12:50.297]  But internally, that story is allowed out.
[02:12:50.657 --> 02:12:54.298]  Yeah, so in any case, what does the 9-11 Commission do?
[02:12:54.378 --> 02:12:58.720]  It says Cheney didn't go down to the underground bunker until
[02:13:00.785 --> 02:13:01.925]  9.58, almost 10 o'clock.
[02:13:02.486 --> 02:13:08.409]  And so by the time he got around to giving the shoot-down order, Flight 93 had already crashed.
[02:13:08.570 --> 02:13:13.873]  And so he couldn't have possibly been responsible for ordering it to be shot down.
[02:13:15.911 --> 02:13:16.191]  No.
[02:13:17.012 --> 02:13:21.714]  So they lied by 45 or 50 minutes as to when Cheney went down below.
[02:13:21.994 --> 02:13:25.916]  Well, you also again mentioned that in their entire report they don't even mention Building 7.
[02:13:26.056 --> 02:13:29.258]  I know I'm repeating this, but a 47-story building.
[02:13:29.758 --> 02:13:31.919]  Think of all the covers the Madrid fire got.
[02:13:32.159 --> 02:13:32.980]  Yeah.
[02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:34.481]  It was 40 stories.
[02:13:34.781 --> 02:13:40.804]  If it hadn't have been for the Twin Towers, which were so huge and got, you know, so romantic,
[02:13:41.739 --> 02:13:44.322]  Uh, this would have been the really big story.
[02:13:44.662 --> 02:13:52.670]  And any city in the world where a 47-story building collapsed, that would have been, in a sense, the story of the year.
[02:13:52.810 --> 02:13:55.433]  Well, the Alfred P. Murrow building was 9 stories.
[02:13:56.093 --> 02:13:57.995]  Yeah, but 47 stories?
[02:13:58.135 --> 02:13:59.837]  That is a humongous building.
[02:14:00.541 --> 02:14:02.483]  And yet... But it wasn't hit by an airplane.
[02:14:02.723 --> 02:14:04.224]  Now they've had four stories on it.
[02:14:04.684 --> 02:14:05.925]  First, a gas tank blew up.
[02:14:05.965 --> 02:14:06.846]  Now they admit it never did.
[02:14:07.706 --> 02:14:10.128]  Then the fires burned and made it collapse.
[02:14:10.148 --> 02:14:11.249]  Then the scientists looked at it.
[02:14:11.629 --> 02:14:12.250]  Wouldn't happen.
[02:14:12.570 --> 02:14:12.950]  Okay.
[02:14:13.991 --> 02:14:15.532]  Then they said it was a combination of things.
[02:14:15.632 --> 02:14:21.577]  Now they say that the North Tower fell and hit it and knocked out its support column, but publicly
[02:14:22.197 --> 02:14:24.018]  It's not even in the main debris field.
[02:14:24.439 --> 02:14:27.200]  None of the North Tower hit it.
[02:14:27.240 --> 02:14:28.401]  There was no damage to it.
[02:14:28.421 --> 02:14:29.462]  Then fire started.
[02:14:29.742 --> 02:14:31.443]  I mean, this is insane!
[02:14:31.883 --> 02:14:34.325]  But you know, there's so many people who believe it.
[02:14:34.445 --> 02:14:43.450]  I was on a show the other night and a caller called in and said, you're just absolutely crazy because we know how building number seven collapsed.
[02:14:43.510 --> 02:14:50.955]  There was all that fuel in there and it got set on fire and caused this massive fire.
[02:14:51.621 --> 02:15:01.007]  Well, that's one of the stories, and you know, that's what the FEMA report put out, that maybe that fuel caught on fire.
[02:15:01.027 --> 02:15:06.171]  Maybe it caused the exact metal columns to implode first, and the panels to fall, and then the encryption falls in on itself.
[02:15:06.351 --> 02:15:10.654]  They ignore the fact that the fires show there was no massive fire in the building.
[02:15:11.565 --> 02:15:14.167]  But a massive fire wouldn't have done it to begin with!
[02:15:14.407 --> 02:15:14.948]  That's right.
[02:15:15.028 --> 02:15:15.908]  I mean, look at Madrid.
[02:15:15.968 --> 02:15:26.075]  We had flames shooting 100 feet in the air, white hot, shooting straight up for a day and a half, and nothing but tiny inch-round ceiling supports melted.
[02:15:26.516 --> 02:15:28.917]  Right, and the same thing in the Philadelphia fire of 1991.
[02:15:30.919 --> 02:15:35.422]  And nevertheless, that's all ignored and said, oh, that fuel
[02:15:37.578 --> 02:16:00.994]  uh... in the basement somehow got pumped upstairs and uh... now they don't say that now they say the buildings were all built improperly sure but uh... my point is that they put out these various stories and uh... so a good deal of the populace believe this or that they don't hear about the revision and i say what i want to go through more of the reasons that we look at the predominant theory on on on
[02:16:01.454 --> 02:16:01.934]  Yes, I certainly am.
[02:16:02.234 --> 02:16:02.935]  Alright, I have a question.
[02:16:21.340 --> 02:16:29.705]  The foreword to your book, New Pearl Harbor, which I have, and I also saw you on C-SPAN, we're all very hungry to get information on 9-1-1.
[02:16:30.185 --> 02:16:33.888]  The foreword to your book, New Pearl Harbor, was written by Richard Falk.
[02:16:34.288 --> 02:16:38.611]  Would you explain to me, sir, that you worked with this man as a team,
[02:16:39.371 --> 02:16:49.802]  This man is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations who worked on New World Order projects for the CFR, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and the Rockefeller Foundation.
[02:16:50.283 --> 02:16:52.485]  John Cobb is also a buddy of yours.
[02:16:53.286 --> 02:16:56.467]  And co-write with you on your project.
[02:16:56.487 --> 02:17:00.788]  Well, I'm not going to defend these individuals if this is true, but I will say, I've read one of his books.
[02:17:00.868 --> 02:17:01.868]  It's good information.
[02:17:02.088 --> 02:17:02.548]  It's true.
[02:17:02.788 --> 02:17:05.229]  But let's get a comment from our guest on this.
[02:17:05.249 --> 02:17:07.289]  Let's find out what his... I know, I know.
[02:17:07.450 --> 02:17:08.150]  Stay there, Carol.
[02:17:08.170 --> 02:17:10.070]  We've got to give him... David?
[02:17:11.190 --> 02:17:21.433]  Well, my association with Richard Falk and John Cobb, who was actually my professor of theology, those are two of the associations I am most proud of.
[02:17:22.427 --> 02:17:24.208]  And with regard to Richard... Globalism.
[02:17:24.508 --> 02:17:24.808]  Pardon?
[02:17:25.128 --> 02:17:26.949]  Globalism is what it's all about.
[02:17:26.989 --> 02:17:28.249]  Well, you... What's your agenda?
[02:17:28.650 --> 02:17:32.791]  You've got these little slogans, but as I was explaining to you... Tell you what, stay there, David.
[02:17:32.831 --> 02:17:33.391]  We got him awake.
[02:17:33.411 --> 02:17:35.832]  We'll let Carol finish up on the other side and let you respond.
[02:17:36.773 --> 02:17:38.834]  And I've got my comment on this subject.
[02:17:38.854 --> 02:17:39.514]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:39.534 --> 02:17:39.934]  Stay with us.
[02:17:46.147 --> 02:17:54.140]  Did you know that sugar, that sweet and simple, inoffensive-looking, refined substance you use in your coffee and cupcakes actually reduces your body's ability to protect you?
[02:17:54.520 --> 02:17:55.802]  It suppresses your immune system!
[02:17:56.003 --> 02:17:56.684]  Now, check this out.
[02:17:57.044 --> 02:18:00.430]  The average American consumes 2 to 3 pounds of sugar on average each week.
[02:18:00.450 --> 02:18:01.231]  That's about 100 times more than you.
[02:18:01.371 --> 02:18:01.932]  We're good to go.

[02:19:11.446 --> 02:19:23.236]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[02:19:47.807 --> 02:19:52.409]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[02:19:52.709 --> 02:19:55.069]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.

[02:20:48.037 --> 02:20:53.020]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[02:20:53.280 --> 02:20:55.882]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[02:20:56.102 --> 02:21:04.607]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.

[02:21:49.833 --> 02:22:07.314]  Alright, we just got this segment and part of the next segment with David Ray Griffin, so we need to hurry because we've got a lot of phone lines here and I don't want to give everybody a chance, but I want to cover a few other lies of the 9-11 Whitewash Commission, the Unindependent Commission, the Control Commission, the Kangaroo Commission, but
[02:22:08.760 --> 02:22:10.982]  The Forest Commission, I'm sorry, I'm perseverating.
[02:22:11.842 --> 02:22:15.685]  Carol in Ohio, real fast, finish up what you were saying, I'm going to let David respond.
[02:22:15.945 --> 02:22:19.808]  Okay, on C-SPAN he advocated working with NGOs.
[02:22:19.888 --> 02:22:20.949]  Those are global...
[02:22:21.876 --> 02:22:50.011]  uh... united nations group his advocacy and solutions and uh... global bill of rights he is a one-worlder he is a part of the problem he's giving out truth but his solutions are playing right into the agenda okay carol thank you for the call uh... david ray griffin response well as i say i have not uh... published what uh... i'm in favor of and uh... it's uh... with regard to richard you know people pritchard fault
[02:22:50.666 --> 02:22:53.708]  People get their little slogan that he's part of the CFR.
[02:22:54.188 --> 02:23:05.055]  Well, his primary act, as he told me, on the CFR, which is not one of the organizations that he spends much time with, was to oppose David Rockefeller.
[02:23:05.735 --> 02:23:18.703]  Furthermore, if you want to read Richard's views, I would suggest you read his book, On Humane Governance, and also his critique called Predatory Globalization.
[02:23:19.343 --> 02:23:19.924]  And you will see
[02:23:20.829 --> 02:23:22.290]  This is no scary figure.
[02:23:22.791 --> 02:23:29.236]  This is simply a guy who believes that the present world order is very unfair.
[02:23:29.296 --> 02:23:39.644]  We have global apartheid, which is worse than apartheid in South Africa, and he's trying to find a way that we might move beyond that to some sort of humane global order.
[02:23:41.626 --> 02:23:42.066]  Oh boy.
[02:23:42.426 --> 02:23:45.088]  Let's talk to Ed in Utah.
[02:23:45.209 --> 02:23:46.490]  Ed, you're on the air with David Wright Griffin.
[02:23:46.530 --> 02:23:46.930]  Go ahead.
[02:23:50.245 --> 02:23:50.645]  Am I there?
[02:23:50.785 --> 02:23:51.426]  Yes, you are.
[02:23:51.667 --> 02:23:52.287]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:23:53.609 --> 02:23:54.630]  Thanks for having him on.
[02:23:55.271 --> 02:24:00.678]  Mr. Griffin, Professor, your book was featured in the American Free Press newspaper.
[02:24:01.900 --> 02:24:07.808]  In fact, Alex, I think they introduced the book, and I want to throw a couple things into the mix.
[02:24:08.713 --> 02:24:13.796]  You brought up Mr. Silverstein, who did in fact was one of the owners of the Trey Towers.
[02:24:14.596 --> 02:24:16.477]  And the other one of course... He was the chief owner.
[02:24:16.738 --> 02:24:17.158]  Pardon me?
[02:24:17.378 --> 02:24:18.038]  Chief owner, yes.
[02:24:18.078 --> 02:24:21.200]  Chief owner, but the other one is Frank Lowey, a man from Israel.
[02:24:21.580 --> 02:24:30.045]  And I want to make a connection here, Alex, when you have, and by the way, the American Free Press has brought to light Corporal Timothy McNiven.
[02:24:30.512 --> 02:24:40.197]  The man that has on the front page of their, a couple of issues ago, Alex, has brought to light the fact that in 1976 in... Well, I interviewed him.
[02:24:40.237 --> 02:24:43.859]  They had a war game in Germany concerning exact attacks of 9-11.
[02:24:43.939 --> 02:24:45.219]  Well, look, I got a lot of callers.
[02:24:45.259 --> 02:24:46.420]  Okay, but here's my point.
[02:24:46.440 --> 02:24:47.581]  You're bringing up Israel.
[02:24:47.601 --> 02:24:52.083]  Do you want to get Griffin to comment on that or do you want to... Can I finish my point and I'll go?
[02:24:52.921 --> 02:24:53.663]  Yeah, of course you can, sir.
[02:24:53.683 --> 02:24:54.304]  Yeah, okay.
[02:24:54.564 --> 02:24:56.708]  Mr. Chertoff, who is from Israel.
[02:24:56.768 --> 02:24:59.273]  Yes, he was born in New Jersey, but it was on a stopover.
[02:24:59.654 --> 02:25:00.536]  Mr. Chertoff...
[02:25:01.587 --> 02:25:08.791]  Is the man that released 140, what I say are the Israeli Mossad perpetrators of 9-11, that very day.
[02:25:09.131 --> 02:25:15.394]  He released them, Alex, and sent them back, deported them back to Israel in the months after 9-11.
[02:25:15.714 --> 02:25:30.442]  And so when you look at this, and what Colonel Don DeGrand Prix has exposed, that is Mr. Meigs, another Israeli that took over Popular Mechanics last September so that they could fire the editorial staff there, Alex, so they could come on there and attack you,
[02:25:31.162 --> 02:25:34.845]  Well, I would like to reinforce his point about popular mechanics.
[02:25:35.245 --> 02:25:37.126]  If people think that's the magazine it used to be,
[02:25:57.591 --> 02:25:58.072]  It's not.
[02:25:58.352 --> 02:26:03.674]  It was taken over and this young guy, they call him the Senior Researcher.
[02:26:03.734 --> 02:26:04.855]  He's 25 years old.
[02:26:05.055 --> 02:26:06.976]  The cousin of the Homeland Security Director.
[02:26:06.996 --> 02:26:07.816]  Right, right.
[02:26:07.956 --> 02:26:10.857]  And so that piece is pure propaganda.
[02:26:10.897 --> 02:26:15.620]  He will not come on this show, but then accuses me on other shows of being afraid to debate him.
[02:26:15.640 --> 02:26:15.920]  Yeah.
[02:26:16.460 --> 02:26:22.323]  With regard to Israel's involvement, there are two kinds of 9-11 researchers.
[02:26:22.383 --> 02:26:22.843]  Those who
[02:26:23.462 --> 02:26:28.023]  Who tried to figure out what really happened that day, and that's a worthy enterprise.
[02:26:29.403 --> 02:26:39.466]  But some of us simply focus on the point that the official story is false, and therefore... Yeah, we know it's the wildest conspiracy theory ever, and I'll say this about Israel.
[02:26:40.206 --> 02:26:46.008]  I think Israel's corrupt, out of control, does a lot of bad things, but these intelligence agencies are all mixed together.
[02:26:46.048 --> 02:26:48.248]  There's subgroups in every agency that works together.
[02:26:48.268 --> 02:26:49.368]  Did Israel know?
[02:26:49.388 --> 02:26:50.709]  Did Israel support it?
[02:26:51.169 --> 02:26:51.509]  Yes.
[02:26:52.348 --> 02:26:54.769]  But did they have NORAD stand down and do all this other stuff?
[02:26:54.869 --> 02:26:55.149]  No!
[02:26:55.169 --> 02:26:56.850]  I mean, it's like the Kennedy assassination.
[02:26:57.190 --> 02:27:00.331]  You had a bunch of intelligence agencies and the mafia together.
[02:27:00.651 --> 02:27:05.533]  The globalists do this to have membranes of separation and plausible deniability.
[02:27:05.573 --> 02:27:05.813]  David?
[02:27:06.733 --> 02:27:12.055]  Yeah, so I'm just agnostic on what role, if any, Israel played.
[02:27:12.436 --> 02:27:15.977]  My focus is on the fact that the official story doesn't make sense.
[02:27:17.324 --> 02:27:19.286]  Which I think is really the central thing to attack.
[02:27:19.326 --> 02:27:21.868]  I mean, their story is a complete ridiculous fraud.
[02:27:22.148 --> 02:27:22.708]  That's right.
[02:27:22.748 --> 02:27:31.475]  And that's one thing the 9-11 truth movement agrees on, whereas every researcher has his own or her own private theory.
[02:27:31.495 --> 02:27:32.937]  Alright, let me write back.
[02:27:33.297 --> 02:27:33.998]  More calls coming up.
[02:27:36.299 --> 02:27:37.200]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.700 --> 02:27:39.302]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.223 --> 02:27:42.905]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.901 --> 02:27:52.406]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[02:27:52.586 --> 02:27:53.647]  You wear deodorant, right?
[02:27:53.767 --> 02:27:54.648]  Well, let's hope you do.
[02:27:54.748 --> 02:27:57.591]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[02:27:57.771 --> 02:28:02.675]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[02:28:02.896 --> 02:28:04.017]  Check out this new product.
[02:28:04.137 --> 02:28:07.039]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.

[02:30:21.742 --> 02:30:23.743]  That's when I called Debt Relief USA.

[02:30:36.795 --> 02:30:36.915]  800-509-3201 800-509-3201
[02:30:54.264 --> 02:30:59.708]  When the levy breaks, when the facts come out, the globalists and their controllers will have no place to stay.
[02:31:00.129 --> 02:31:01.269]  They're going down.
[02:31:01.830 --> 02:31:03.191]  They're going down now.
[02:31:03.471 --> 02:31:04.652]  They're going down.
[02:31:06.534 --> 02:31:07.514]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:31:08.615 --> 02:31:11.597]  Look, bottom line, they wanted to cover up 9-11.
[02:31:11.758 --> 02:31:12.658]  They can't contain it.
[02:31:12.698 --> 02:31:13.639]  They can't control it.
[02:31:14.480 --> 02:31:17.142]  And I saw David Ray Griffin's presentation on C-SPAN.
[02:31:17.182 --> 02:31:18.122]  It was hardcore.
[02:31:19.323 --> 02:31:21.145]  It was terrifying to the NWO.
[02:31:21.966 --> 02:31:31.690]  We do have to make sure that they don't use that energy to suck us off into some phony left-right world government as the answer to the evil American fascista, when in reality it's all controlled by the same people.
[02:31:32.950 --> 02:31:38.172]  But the process of exposing the globalists is going along quite nicely.
[02:31:38.992 --> 02:31:39.673]  And I like it.
[02:31:39.753 --> 02:31:48.076]  I like it that there's so many other prominent people out fighting the globalists and exposing their manufactured terror systems because it makes us all safer.
[02:31:48.618 --> 02:31:50.498]  There's just one or two of us doing this, they'll kill you.
[02:31:50.859 --> 02:31:51.919]  They have killed researchers.
[02:31:52.299 --> 02:31:59.460]  But when there's thousands of people, and there are now thousands of prominent people, millions of average folks taking action, it's only a matter of time.
[02:31:59.921 --> 02:32:06.702]  I'm sorry I'm having to go to the calls quickly, but I mean, we could take calls all day and never give David Griffin a chance to talk about anything.
[02:32:07.062 --> 02:32:09.503]  I'll have to have him back up sometime for two hours if he'll do it.
[02:32:12.990 --> 02:32:14.752]  Look, I mean, I've been in this since before 9-11.
[02:32:14.932 --> 02:32:19.455]  I understand their program, and again, I think overall what he's doing is very positive.
[02:32:19.495 --> 02:32:31.986]  I may not agree with his views on globalization and there being another path that would... Because power always takes over mechanisms of government.
[02:32:32.166 --> 02:32:33.507]  That's why you have to limit government.
[02:32:33.567 --> 02:32:34.408]  I agree with the founders.
[02:32:35.112 --> 02:32:37.974]  But we can agree to disagree on that, plus I haven't seen his full views.
[02:32:38.034 --> 02:32:40.756]  I will review his new book when it comes out on this subject.
[02:32:41.937 --> 02:32:45.799]  Anything you want to add before we talk to Rick, Jeff, and Mike, and that's all we have time for?
[02:32:46.640 --> 02:32:59.628]  Yeah, I would like to say that my second book, the 9-11 Commission Report, has proven to be convincing to people that didn't find the first book convincing for one reason or another.
[02:33:00.208 --> 02:33:04.291]  For example, former CIA member Ray McGovern said that
[02:33:04.969 --> 02:33:11.392]  He never had accepted this alternative view of 9-11 until he read my second book and saw
[02:33:12.517 --> 02:33:15.299]  The obvious lies and omissions.
[02:33:15.339 --> 02:33:19.221]  Well, he was the chief CIA advisor to Ronald Reagan.
[02:33:19.241 --> 02:33:19.842]  We've had him on.
[02:33:20.082 --> 02:33:22.703]  Yeah, so he's a very highly credible figure.
[02:33:22.743 --> 02:33:26.946]  Well, I had him on two years ago, and he said he didn't put it past the government to carry out terror.
[02:33:27.546 --> 02:33:35.611]  That's right, but he had never endorsed the view, and now he has on a public radio in Wisconsin recently.
[02:33:36.597 --> 02:33:47.259]  So really what's happening is people in the power structure, and I'm looking at this objectively and coldly, really are starting to have a conscience and really are starting to speak up.
[02:33:47.619 --> 02:33:55.380]  And so a lot of people shouldn't be so paranoid that, ooh, we can't trust these people because it doesn't help the NWO for all these prominent people to be going public.
[02:33:56.201 --> 02:34:04.142]  That's right, and there are a lot of Republicans, such as Pat Buchanan, and the Zogby poll indicated that
[02:34:05.383 --> 02:34:22.313]  uh... twenty-some percent of the republicans in new york believe that the president of the the white house had advanced knowledge of the attacks fifty percent total and then uh... the the cnn poll was ninety percent did you ever see that cnn poll?
[02:34:22.513 --> 02:34:33.340]  uh... yeah that one does sound extreme but uh... and i didn't see how the question was worded but it's significant that uh... I have it in my film with the question yeah that even uh...
[02:34:34.099 --> 02:34:41.602]  You know, people who consider themselves Republicans and Conservatives said they didn't believe the official story.
[02:34:41.622 --> 02:34:49.146]  Well, the question was, to paraphrase, and I think this is exact, do you believe the government had prior knowledge of 9-11 and consciously failed to act?
[02:34:49.546 --> 02:34:50.366]  Right.
[02:34:50.707 --> 02:34:50.366]  90%.
[02:34:51.307 --> 02:34:51.907]  Is that right?
[02:34:52.007 --> 02:34:54.908]  Well... And that was out of, like, 18,000 respondents.
[02:34:57.964 --> 02:34:58.164]  Yeah.
[02:34:58.524 --> 02:35:00.065]  Let's talk to Rick in Reno.
[02:35:00.165 --> 02:35:01.346]  Rick, thanks for holding, my friend.
[02:35:01.366 --> 02:35:01.746]  Go ahead.
[02:35:02.107 --> 02:35:03.067]  Yes, sir.
[02:35:03.427 --> 02:35:03.988]  Mr. Griffin?
[02:35:05.128 --> 02:35:11.332]  Yeah, Mr. Jones, I put forth the challenge to both of you gentlemen to go to archive.org.
[02:35:12.633 --> 02:35:17.196]  Find the text document entitled, The Final 9-11 Commission Report.
[02:35:18.296 --> 02:35:23.680]  And each of you write a review, because they so far have not been professionally reviewed, this document.
[02:35:25.481 --> 02:35:26.821]  Alright, I'll try to check that out.
[02:35:26.861 --> 02:35:27.542]  What's the name again?
[02:35:28.402 --> 02:35:30.684]  No, I don't have a website.
[02:35:30.704 --> 02:35:33.947]  I just hope people will read the books and make up their own minds.
[02:35:53.021 --> 02:35:56.604]  Well, before we take two final calls and let you go, I was flattered.
[02:35:56.644 --> 02:36:02.409]  I had no idea when you first came on, you said you'd learned a lot from this broadcast, and then coming from you, I appreciate that.
[02:36:02.489 --> 02:36:09.535]  Well, yeah, I've cited your show in my books, particularly the second edition.
[02:36:09.555 --> 02:36:11.797]  I didn't know you got it directly from the show.
[02:36:12.097 --> 02:36:20.224]  Yeah, yes, and particularly in the second edition, the updated edition of New Pearl Harbor, I cited, and then again in the second book.
[02:36:21.127 --> 02:36:30.876]  Well, look, I don't care who gets credit for being the first person on 9-11, but it's an authoritative position to be able to claim you're the godfather or the granddaddy of the 9-11 truth movement.
[02:36:31.256 --> 02:36:40.605]  But, I mean, two months before 9-11, and I've never done this before since, I said, call the White House, they're going to attack the World Trade Center, call Bush, tell him don't do it, that Lodin will take the blame, he's their asset.
[02:36:41.185 --> 02:36:51.349]  And I did it from day one and it took a lot of heat and then other people come along, not you, but come along and claim that they are the sole source and start telling everyone what to do.
[02:36:51.389 --> 02:36:52.349]  I think that's very dangerous.
[02:36:53.589 --> 02:36:54.850]  Yeah, it's unfortunate.
[02:36:55.910 --> 02:37:01.732]  I myself am very clear about the fact that I was a Johnny Come Lately to this issue and I appreciate
[02:37:02.421 --> 02:37:07.706]  The work that you and lots of others did that made my own books possible.
[02:37:08.006 --> 02:37:09.627]  But I wouldn't be here saying that.
[02:37:09.668 --> 02:37:18.636]  I've never said this in the last few months, except that other people are saying, I am the founder, I am the leader, and literally saying, I order people, I say what you talk about.
[02:37:18.716 --> 02:37:19.636]  I mean, it's crazy.
[02:37:20.097 --> 02:37:23.400]  So I'm standing up and saying, OK, I'm the granddaddy, because I really am.
[02:37:23.420 --> 02:37:24.901]  I mean, it sounds obnoxious.
[02:37:24.941 --> 02:37:25.702]  I'm having to do that.
[02:37:28.928 --> 02:37:35.432]  Yeah, I say it's unfortunate and I hope for the most part we can just keep the focus on the facts.
[02:37:36.013 --> 02:37:39.335]  Exactly, it's not about Alex Jones or David Ray Griffin or the Easter Bunny.
[02:37:41.036 --> 02:37:41.436]  Exactly.
[02:37:41.496 --> 02:37:45.619]  It's about a military industrial complex that needs a new enemy to fight and so it's making us the enemy.
[02:37:47.674 --> 02:37:58.456]  Exactly, and the more the 9-11 Truth Movement gets embroiled in ego wars, the less effective we'll be in terms of our real task.
[02:37:58.516 --> 02:38:04.197]  I'm almost embarrassed that I've come out and said this, but if you look at the record of my site, you'll never find us doing this.
[02:38:05.837 --> 02:38:15.199]  But you understand the power position of being able to claim you're the founder, and that other people claim that, and I'm sure you've seen people claiming that they speak ex cathedra, basically.
[02:38:15.908 --> 02:38:39.842]  Yeah, as I said in my first book, in a note, that I didn't have time to go back and see who had first discovered what, and so I was very conscious of the fact that I wasn't giving proper credit, but I hope that if the movement is successful, that'll be the time for some historian to write a history and give that kind of proper credit.
[02:38:39.862 --> 02:38:44.425]  But again, understand, sir, the only reason I raise it to scholars such as yourself is because others have done this.
[02:38:45.466 --> 02:38:46.627]  No, I understand that.
[02:38:46.928 --> 02:38:48.509]  And then they claim authority.
[02:38:48.669 --> 02:38:49.670]  I have no authority!
[02:38:50.830 --> 02:38:52.832]  I'm not saying I have a right to tell anybody anything.
[02:38:52.912 --> 02:38:53.773]  I've learned from everybody.
[02:38:54.013 --> 02:38:54.753]  I've learned from you.
[02:38:56.235 --> 02:38:58.977]  So, oh, it's amazing.
[02:38:59.937 --> 02:39:00.818]  Two final calls.
[02:39:01.278 --> 02:39:04.881]  Jeff in Massachusetts and then Michael in New York.
[02:39:04.921 --> 02:39:05.462]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[02:39:06.042 --> 02:39:09.284]  Yes, my original question was on depleted uranium poisoning.
[02:39:10.746 --> 02:39:13.868]  And as far as depleted uranium poisoning is concerned,
[02:39:14.372 --> 02:39:16.153]  Are the Americans just getting poisoned?
[02:39:16.553 --> 02:39:18.874]  Well, it shows what murderers the globalists are.
[02:39:18.914 --> 02:39:20.295]  You don't think they'd kill 3,000?
[02:39:21.275 --> 02:39:24.296]  Thousands of our troops are already starting to get sick from this in the Iraqis.
[02:39:24.356 --> 02:39:25.017]  David, comments?
[02:39:26.357 --> 02:39:42.104]  Well, yeah, I mean this idea that we're promoting a culture of life, the disregard for the lives of the workers and people living around the World Trade Center to come out and say the air was clean and now thousands are getting sick and dying
[02:39:42.765 --> 02:39:52.290]  And the same thing in Iraq, and of course we've had that in other wars, in Afghanistan, and it's absolutely criminal that we're still using this depleted uranium.
[02:39:52.310 --> 02:39:54.772]  Well, it shows the cavalier attitude towards life.
[02:39:55.892 --> 02:39:56.473]  That's right.
[02:39:56.953 --> 02:40:01.936]  One way that some elitists talk about American troops, you know,
[02:40:02.563 --> 02:40:07.391]  They talk publicly about, oh, support our troops, be patriotic, and so forth.
[02:40:07.431 --> 02:40:09.574]  What they're saying they have is, young men are dying?
[02:40:09.614 --> 02:40:10.655]  That's what young men are for.
[02:40:10.936 --> 02:40:11.477]  That's right.
[02:40:11.677 --> 02:40:16.865]  So some of them refer to a soldier as OFU, One Fodder Unit.
[02:40:17.489 --> 02:40:22.413]  I also have some information, too, if you'd like me to give a website address.
[02:40:22.454 --> 02:40:23.014]  Yeah, real fast.
[02:40:23.034 --> 02:40:24.315]  I've got to let him go in the next minute or two.
[02:40:24.475 --> 02:40:24.756]  Okay.
[02:40:25.496 --> 02:40:29.420]  www.cuttingedge.org David Bay 1-800-451-8211
[02:40:33.598 --> 02:40:38.361]  You can look at the website to learn all about the information.
[02:40:38.541 --> 02:40:39.321]  I know who he is.
[02:40:39.341 --> 02:40:40.222]  He carries my videos.
[02:40:40.462 --> 02:40:40.702]  Okay.
[02:40:40.762 --> 02:40:41.142]  Good guy.
[02:40:41.162 --> 02:40:42.703]  Thanks for the call.
[02:40:43.384 --> 02:40:44.164]  I really appreciate it.
[02:40:44.224 --> 02:40:45.925]  Last caller, Michael in New York.
[02:40:45.965 --> 02:40:46.525]  Go ahead, Michael.
[02:40:46.966 --> 02:40:48.166]  Hi, good afternoon, Alex.
[02:40:48.246 --> 02:40:49.707]  Good afternoon, David.
[02:40:50.248 --> 02:40:59.573]  Alex, with 9-11, I watched it live that morning, and Tom Brokaw on NBC stated that flight over Pennsylvania, we shot it down.
[02:41:00.350 --> 02:41:05.273]  Then, within five, ten minutes at the max, they retracted that statement.
[02:41:05.333 --> 02:41:07.835]  The state police saw it get blown up, folks.
[02:41:08.975 --> 02:41:11.657]  Jets don't spread over eight miles.
[02:41:11.697 --> 02:41:20.222]  The buildings, when they came down, I mean, anybody that has watched some professional demolished buildings in the past, when you see those buildings come down, you know they're demolished.
[02:41:20.702 --> 02:41:25.085]  That's the point David never could get into, is that we had all this concrete turned into powder, David.
[02:41:25.888 --> 02:41:26.629]  Well, that's right.
[02:41:26.689 --> 02:41:30.013]  That's one of the 10 characteristics of controlled demolition.
[02:41:30.073 --> 02:41:31.956]  And in this case, it was extreme.
[02:41:32.456 --> 02:41:38.764]  Virtually all of the concrete was pulverized into very tiny powder particles.
[02:41:39.545 --> 02:41:43.811]  And I refer to Tom Brokaw, but also good old Dan Rather.
[02:41:44.386 --> 02:41:51.150]  When he saw Building 7 come down, he said, well, that's just like those buildings we've seen brought down by controlled demolition.
[02:41:51.211 --> 02:41:52.671]  Looks like well-placed dynamite.
[02:41:52.711 --> 02:41:53.932]  Finish up in 30 seconds, Michael.
[02:41:54.353 --> 02:41:57.495]  Okay, and so now, Alex, your new video is great.
[02:41:57.515 --> 02:41:58.835]  I'm making copies, thank you.
[02:41:59.396 --> 02:42:07.081]  And you referred to the New World Order as the fourth rank, and I just wanted to touch base on that, because previously, earlier in the show,
[02:42:07.837 --> 02:42:14.223]  Um, your statement that, you know, the New World Order is a corporate thing, but that's where they all infiltrated after the war.
[02:42:14.563 --> 02:42:22.590]  Of course, Operation Paperclip, our government agents brought them in quietly, created the CIA... Yeah, I call it, and I appreciate your call, great points, Michael.
[02:42:22.610 --> 02:42:25.633]  I'm sorry that these great callers don't have any more time or all the others that are holding.
[02:42:26.193 --> 02:42:30.094]  But I call it the fourth right because they were supporters of Nazis, the current regime.
[02:42:30.935 --> 02:42:32.295]  They love the fascist model.
[02:42:32.335 --> 02:42:33.795]  They love the word Homeland Security.
[02:42:33.995 --> 02:42:35.376]  They love the black uniforms.
[02:42:35.736 --> 02:42:38.677]  The skull and bones is the same symbol as the Nazis.
[02:42:39.077 --> 02:42:41.978]  It is the same group, the same spirit.
[02:42:42.878 --> 02:42:44.399]  And David Ray Griffin, do you agree with that?
[02:42:45.299 --> 02:42:55.122]  Well yes, and my colleague Richard Falk is now working on asking the question, will the global empire
[02:42:55.618 --> 02:42:57.000]  Come out to global fascism.
[02:43:13.092 --> 02:43:13.492]  Thank you.
[02:43:13.512 --> 02:43:14.153]  Bye-bye.
[02:43:14.393 --> 02:43:15.814]  All right, there he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:43:16.835 --> 02:43:33.990]  I've got some final news I want to cover in the final segment, but right now, waiting in the wings patiently for the last 15 minutes as we ran over, is the owner of the GCN radio network, the Genesis Communication radio network, and something most of our listeners don't know about, because I get calls every day, how do I get seen at your show, how do I listen online?
[02:43:35.291 --> 02:43:40.696]  I don't sell this service, but the network does at a very affordable price, and it allows us to continue and to expand
[02:43:42.063 --> 02:43:43.424]  And Ted Anderson joins us.
[02:43:43.865 --> 02:43:45.666]  Listen to any show, anytime you want.
[02:43:45.707 --> 02:43:52.132]  The archives, the live streams, in 32-bit, just crystal clear audio instead of the little 8-bit.
[02:43:52.753 --> 02:43:54.335]  Ted Anderson, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:43:54.555 --> 02:44:00.080]  Hey, it's great to be back again, Alex, and once again, just a completely informative show.
[02:44:00.140 --> 02:44:06.726]  I mean, you just don't get this kind of information on ABC or CBS or any of these other places, and I'm sure glad we have you here at Genesis.
[02:44:06.826 --> 02:44:07.906]  And it's very expensive.
[02:44:07.946 --> 02:44:12.147]  Our satellites alone, we don't have pledge drives, but we need, Ted, we need your support.
[02:44:12.708 --> 02:44:15.788]  The satellites alone are like, what, $14,000 a month or something.
[02:44:17.329 --> 02:44:23.090]  So when you buy this service, you get all the radio shows, the archives, but you also support freedom and this voice.
[02:44:23.411 --> 02:44:25.011]  Ted, tell them about the internet service.
[02:44:25.211 --> 02:44:26.832]  Well, here's what the deal is.
[02:44:26.872 --> 02:44:29.333]  You just come to GCNlive.com.
[02:44:29.353 --> 02:44:37.698]  You'll notice in the upper left hand corner there's a place for people to subscribe and also where you can listen and so on and so forth.
[02:44:38.278 --> 02:44:41.360]  For $7.95, Alex, we sell the archives.
[02:44:42.200 --> 02:44:45.302]  You can listen to any show at any time you want.
[02:44:45.382 --> 02:44:54.367]  If you heard a part of the show and you feel like you need to have the whole version of the show, you just go click on the button and all of a sudden you have Alex Jones
[02:44:54.907 --> 02:44:57.748]  for three hours for that particular show for that particular day.
[02:44:57.768 --> 02:45:00.850]  They're posted within about two hours of the time the show is over.
[02:45:01.370 --> 02:45:10.595]  A very convenient way to do that and that's for $7.95 and for $9.95 you get to listen to the higher bitrate streams plus also you get to listen to the archives.
[02:45:11.035 --> 02:45:18.378]  We also have, you're talking about the CDs, we do sell the entire month's worth of Alex Jones on CD.
[02:45:20.219 --> 02:45:22.000]  Another really good thing to have for $19.95
[02:45:25.065 --> 02:45:25.986]  And you're asking me about it.
[02:45:26.026 --> 02:45:27.207]  I hear it all the time, too, Alex.
[02:45:27.247 --> 02:45:29.269]  People say, well, how can I support GCN?
[02:45:29.289 --> 02:45:33.012]  I mean, GCN is like a voice in the dark, if you will.
[02:45:33.592 --> 02:45:36.294]  And the best way, you know, people like to donate and all that.
[02:45:36.354 --> 02:45:37.755]  That's really wonderful and great.
[02:45:38.096 --> 02:45:41.378]  But we would like to be able to provide you with some service for the funds.
[02:45:41.678 --> 02:45:43.760]  And the best way you can do that is become a subscriber.
[02:45:43.800 --> 02:45:46.062]  Just come right over to GCNlive.com.
[02:45:46.702 --> 02:45:53.525]  And click on the subscriptions button and you'll become a member of GCN and we'll provide you with the latest, greatest services that we can offer.
[02:45:53.545 --> 02:45:57.087]  That's the live streaming, that's the archives, it's all there.
[02:45:57.667 --> 02:45:59.828]  And on one CD, folks, it's MP3.
[02:46:00.189 --> 02:46:03.070]  Most of the new CD players, even in your cars, have this.
[02:46:03.110 --> 02:46:04.191]  If not, you can buy one for like $20.
[02:46:05.391 --> 02:46:07.955]  Radio Shack, literally, that plays MP3s.
[02:46:07.975 --> 02:46:11.260]  You're talking about how many hundreds of hours can go on one CD?
[02:46:11.280 --> 02:46:12.922]  Well, that's the thing, Alex.
[02:46:12.983 --> 02:46:19.031]  I mean, you go three hours a day for five days a week and for an entire month, and we sell the whole entire month for $19.95.
[02:46:19.773 --> 02:46:20.614]  How do people get that?
[02:46:20.974 --> 02:46:28.761]  Well it's just a matter of going right over to GCNlive.com and click on the subscription button and you'll get that.
[02:46:28.801 --> 02:46:29.862]  It's that quick and easy.
[02:46:30.043 --> 02:46:33.646]  So you can subscribe right there but also where do you go to buy the individual CDs?
[02:46:33.686 --> 02:46:35.628]  Well obviously it's the same thing Alex.
[02:46:35.648 --> 02:46:37.730]  You just come right into GCNlive.com.
[02:46:37.770 --> 02:46:39.772]  On the upper left hand corner you're going to see a button.
[02:46:39.792 --> 02:46:42.934]  I'll just tell you exactly what it says because I'm looking at the website right now.
[02:46:43.455 --> 02:46:45.477]  There's a subscription and archive
[02:46:46.081 --> 02:46:51.187]  There's a stream and archive subscriptions, and once you click on that button, you can order the CDs from there.
[02:46:51.387 --> 02:46:53.450]  What if people want to call?
[02:46:53.910 --> 02:46:58.415]  Well, if they do want to call, we do have an 800 number set up for that, or I should say a toll-free number.
[02:46:58.455 --> 02:46:58.555]  It's 877...
[02:47:00.702 --> 02:47:03.244]  376.45.
[02:47:00.722 --> 02:47:03.244]  That's 877-376.45.
[02:47:03.524 --> 02:47:10.229]  What if somebody wants to sign up and get a whole year?
[02:47:10.630 --> 02:47:11.490]  Well, they can do that.
[02:47:11.691 --> 02:47:14.353]  Actually, we sell six-month subscriptions right now.
[02:47:14.413 --> 02:47:18.476]  If they want to do a whole year, I know George is willing to go in there and put together a special package.
[02:47:18.536 --> 02:47:19.677]  And you guys do this very promptly.
[02:47:19.697 --> 02:47:21.358]  I mean, three or four years ago, it would take a few weeks.
[02:47:21.378 --> 02:47:23.199]  You guys do it very promptly now.
[02:47:23.539 --> 02:47:25.981]  And of course, the online subscription is instant.
[02:47:26.281 --> 02:47:27.983]  They're at the secure online shopping cart.
[02:47:28.183 --> 02:47:29.504]  And for those that don't know, folks,
[02:47:30.064 --> 02:47:36.227]  A year ago before they started this, before it was handled by a different group, we all discussed this, talked about it.
[02:47:36.347 --> 02:47:42.610]  Ted literally, with hundreds of thousands of people a day listening online, could not continue to give it all out for free.
[02:47:42.630 --> 02:47:48.113]  We're talking about $10,000 internet bills a month or more with little 8-bit stream.
[02:47:48.153 --> 02:47:49.393]  People wanted higher quality.
[02:47:49.634 --> 02:47:51.775]  The 8-bit is still free and it's going to be free.
[02:47:52.035 --> 02:47:56.897]  But if you want 32-bit, 16-bit, archives, all of this, how much is it a month, Ted?
[02:47:57.097 --> 02:47:57.537]  Well, it's $9.95.
[02:47:58.018 --> 02:47:59.679]  That's the nice part about it.
[02:47:59.719 --> 02:48:01.400]  If we can just get people to put in there at $9.95.
[02:48:03.181 --> 02:48:14.289]  Every time somebody makes a donation or buys a subscription, this kind of thing, it really does put... That's the meat and potatoes behind the operation that makes us reach more people and get further out there.
[02:48:14.450 --> 02:48:17.632]  I really do think Alex Jones has the ability to become
[02:48:18.527 --> 02:48:23.509]  You know, as great as Rush Limbaugh, as far as I'm concerned, and that's where it all comes from.
[02:48:23.909 --> 02:48:26.690]  Well, they do it too, and charge more.
[02:48:27.310 --> 02:48:32.472]  GCNLive.com, GCNLive.com, or Ted, what's that toll-free number?
[02:48:32.712 --> 02:48:34.052]  It's 877-376-45.
[02:48:34.192 --> 02:48:40.674]  Hey boss, thanks for coming on, and I appreciate all your support of the First Amendment.
[02:48:41.675 --> 02:48:42.275]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:46.067 --> 02:48:47.568]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.768 --> 02:48:50.849]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.989 --> 02:48:54.891]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.931 --> 02:48:59.152]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:59.513 --> 02:49:03.294]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:03.374 --> 02:49:05.235]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.615 --> 02:49:08.716]  Police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:49:08.756 --> 02:49:13.478]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.638 --> 02:49:16.700]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:16.860 --> 02:49:19.721]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:20.221 --> 02:49:26.324]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.864 --> 02:49:30.666]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:49:31.066 --> 02:49:32.427]  Order your video today.
[02:49:32.827 --> 02:49:33.868]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.

[02:51:49.040 --> 02:51:53.822]  The big radio networks with their big marquee shows don't even offer free streams anymore.
[02:51:53.842 --> 02:51:54.522]  They just charge.
[02:51:54.602 --> 02:51:55.322]  We don't do that.
[02:51:55.943 --> 02:51:56.823]  We have the 8-bit.
[02:51:56.963 --> 02:51:58.504]  Not the best quality, but it's listenable.
[02:51:59.264 --> 02:52:02.305]  That's how hundreds of thousands of you a week listen to my show on the internet.
[02:52:03.245 --> 02:52:09.708]  But if you want the 16-bit or the 32-bit, $9.95 a month, you can go to GCNlive.com, click through and do that.
[02:52:10.108 --> 02:52:13.089]  And here's the number to call to get a month's subscription.
[02:52:14.664 --> 02:52:23.348]  Three hours every day, five days a week of my broadcast, 877-376-45 or do that at GCNlive.com as well.
[02:52:23.368 --> 02:52:24.809]  Just tell them what month and what show.
[02:52:25.670 --> 02:52:26.870]  Do that for all the broadcast.
[02:52:27.811 --> 02:52:37.315]  Look, my friends, I want to hit a few final news articles here at the end of the broadcast.
[02:52:37.515 --> 02:52:39.116]  Three hours is just not enough some days.
[02:52:40.076 --> 02:52:40.997]  But at the same time,
[02:52:42.438 --> 02:52:44.039]  I want to just encourage you.
[02:52:44.099 --> 02:52:44.739]  Do not wait.
[02:52:44.839 --> 02:52:45.760]  Do not hesitate.
[02:52:46.400 --> 02:52:47.320]  Grab a pen and paper.
[02:52:47.421 --> 02:52:50.182]  Get my film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:52:51.643 --> 02:52:53.143]  Make copies of it.
[02:52:53.323 --> 02:52:54.324]  Get it out to people.
[02:52:54.364 --> 02:52:55.384]  It's a powerful film.
[02:52:55.425 --> 02:52:56.345]  It's my best work.

[02:54:04.358 --> 02:54:06.779]  A Phoenix man dies after being tasered, yet again.
[02:54:07.637 --> 02:54:09.699]  We have the real origins of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[02:54:09.719 --> 02:54:11.340]  Important article on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:54:11.820 --> 02:54:12.361]  All over the U.S.
[02:54:12.381 --> 02:54:14.603]  they're going to put microphones up on every street corner.
[02:54:14.643 --> 02:54:15.744]  Here's an article out of England.
[02:54:16.104 --> 02:54:18.026]  Listening microphones to be installed in U.K.
[02:54:18.066 --> 02:54:18.626]  lampposts.
[02:54:19.046 --> 02:54:27.333]  In one particular city it says every lamppost in every home will be listened to 24 hours a day by smart computers that automatically call the police if you get too loud.
[02:54:27.673 --> 02:54:28.334]  And listen to you! 1984!
[02:54:30.605 --> 02:54:34.530]  Cisco Systems slammed for RFID staff tracker VNUnit.
[02:54:35.270 --> 02:54:39.195]  Wireless RFID server trackers personnel via tags embedded in their uniforms.
[02:54:39.235 --> 02:54:48.625]  Cisco is coming under fire from privacy groups as it prepares to launch a wireless RFID server that can track people and equipment using existing WIFI networks.
[02:54:50.279 --> 02:54:57.844]  The Wireless Location Appliance 2700 is designed to track RFID tags down a few meters and display the location in a central map.
[02:54:58.205 --> 02:55:01.787]  And it's going to be embedded with radio tags in all the employees' clothing.
[02:55:02.548 --> 02:55:03.969]  Again, just total slave grid.
[02:55:04.469 --> 02:55:08.612]  Boston had to pay $5.1 million to Deb Red Sox fan's family.
[02:55:08.632 --> 02:55:12.655]  Remember, they blew her eye back into her brain at 10 feet away with a gun.
[02:55:12.695 --> 02:55:13.696]  The cops should go to jail.
[02:55:14.562 --> 02:55:20.267]  Victoria Snellgrove wanted it all, to be a successful broadcast journalist and to meet Prince Charming as part of family.
[02:55:21.769 --> 02:55:25.852]  And I'm still young, I still have time, she said on a videotape she recorded in her bedroom.
[02:55:26.613 --> 02:55:30.256]  But now she was killed by a police officer when there wasn't even a riot going on.
[02:55:30.677 --> 02:55:32.699]  Bob Barr, once a Patriot Act, reigned in.
[02:55:32.759 --> 02:55:34.280]  How do you reign in something that's pure evil?
[02:55:35.501 --> 02:55:38.304]  Also, public outrage kills the
[02:55:40.003 --> 02:55:42.549]  70 plus billboards that are saying California and L.A.
[02:55:42.609 --> 02:55:43.230]  is Mexico.
[02:55:43.250 --> 02:55:44.834]  They're saying they're going to remove them.
[02:55:44.874 --> 02:55:45.896]  Yeah, let's see if they really do.
[02:55:47.927 --> 02:55:50.529]  Congress to force agencies to identify video news.
[02:55:50.549 --> 02:55:52.491]  You know, these fake newscasts out of Reuters.
[02:55:52.551 --> 02:55:54.212]  Congress is talking about passing a law.
[02:55:54.572 --> 02:55:56.794]  There's already laws, though, and Bush says he doesn't have to follow them.
[02:55:57.134 --> 02:55:59.816]  But he can't pay for hundreds of millions of dollars of fake newscasts.
[02:56:00.357 --> 02:56:03.840]  Chicago's putting up giant FEMA loudspeakers to announce during emergencies.
[02:56:04.140 --> 02:56:07.603]  It's part of the emergency alert system to take over all radio and TV.
[02:56:07.663 --> 02:56:09.664]  It's already in place for total control.
[02:56:10.505 --> 02:56:14.128]  Court rules IBM does not have to face Nazi charges.
[02:56:15.945 --> 02:56:20.547]  And they say, oh yeah, they're guilty of helping the Nazis, but the statute of limitations is up.
[02:56:20.567 --> 02:56:23.929]  I didn't know there was a statute of limitations on murder.
[02:56:25.170 --> 02:56:26.470]  We're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:26.490 --> 02:56:27.511]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:27.551 --> 02:56:28.631]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:29.272 --> 02:56:30.112]  God bless you all.
[02:56:30.152 --> 02:56:33.614]  Get out there and take on the New World Order and resist tyranny.
