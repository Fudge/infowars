[00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:01.990]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:06.273]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:00:06.273 --> 00:00:10.896]  Monday through Friday from 11am until 2pm.
[00:00:10.896 --> 00:00:14.499]  Central Standard Time back from 9 to midnight.
[00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:16.400]  Central Standard Time.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.142]  We're gonna be going to Tom Flacco here in just a minute or two.
[00:00:20.479 --> 00:00:23.961]  Written for World Net Daily and about 50 other major publications.
[00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:26.982]  Gone to many of the 9-11 Whitewash Commission meetings.
[00:00:26.982 --> 00:00:32.084]  Broken big story after big story that have panned out to be very, very accurate.
[00:00:32.084 --> 00:00:37.046]  This new one, he's gotten a lot of info from intelligence and people on the fringes of intelligence.
[00:00:37.046 --> 00:00:41.528]  We know there's a criminal grand jury that is investigating the Valerie Plame leaks.
[00:00:41.528 --> 00:00:42.428]  That's admitted.
[00:00:43.564 --> 00:00:45.445]  Some people even have trouble dealing with that.
[00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:47.946]  That's like Time Magazine, folks.
[00:00:47.946 --> 00:00:53.828]  But this latest claim by some is that indictments have been handed down.
[00:00:53.828 --> 00:00:55.589]  So that's coming up in a minute or two.
[00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:02.251]  And then later, officials warn a possibility of attack around September 11th, New York Times.
[00:01:02.251 --> 00:01:03.392]  More fear-mongering.
[00:01:03.392 --> 00:01:07.433]  Another report here, FBI terror attacks here in New York, LA, Chicago.
[00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:09.814]  We better have checkpoints and train you all how to be slaves.
[00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:16.470]  Texas becomes the nation's newest majority-minority state.
[00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.591]  You gotta love that.
[00:01:17.591 --> 00:01:24.012]  They're the minority, but they're the majority, and they're gonna be the minority even when there's, you know, I mean, you gotta love it, folks.
[00:01:24.012 --> 00:01:26.733]  I just, I'm gonna comment on this.
[00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:29.253]  Also, Saddam is a speedy execution.
[00:01:29.253 --> 00:01:37.635]  That's like busting a capo in a mafia regime and having the leader of the, you know, the Don,
[00:01:38.695 --> 00:01:44.337]  Who ordered the Capo to carry out crimes, then the Don orders his public execution for carrying out the crimes.
[00:01:44.337 --> 00:01:45.957]  People go, no!
[00:01:45.957 --> 00:01:50.038]  No, the Don needs to get in trouble, and our government is the Don.
[00:01:50.038 --> 00:01:52.559]  So, the Don being the mob boss, folks.
[00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:54.700]  So, that's coming up.
[00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.881]  Two more news on our troops being drugged with amnesiacs.
[00:01:57.881 --> 00:02:01.102]  This is mainstream news after they go out and kill women and children.
[00:02:01.102 --> 00:02:01.962]  Our government drugs them.
[00:02:03.027 --> 00:02:09.911]  Turns out that American media, the folks that give you all the big tabloids, are being used as influence peddlers basically to protect Schwarzenegger.
[00:02:09.911 --> 00:02:10.751]  This is L.A.
[00:02:10.751 --> 00:02:11.652]  Times.
[00:02:11.652 --> 00:02:14.013]  They would go buy up stories just to keep them quiet.
[00:02:14.013 --> 00:02:16.354]  Oh yeah, that's real old.
[00:02:16.354 --> 00:02:17.334]  But now it's the L.A.
[00:02:17.334 --> 00:02:17.875]  Times.
[00:02:17.875 --> 00:02:20.016]  A lot of that stuff's coming up, but for the next hour,
[00:02:20.996 --> 00:02:23.638]  We have got Tom Flacco.
[00:02:23.638 --> 00:02:27.381]  Last but not least, didn't have time to plug it properly last hour.
[00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:36.889]  My new film, 9-11, Rise of the Police State, Marshall Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State, is a mini-series, and it covers the latest police state developments.
[00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:40.492]  I mean, on the ground, we show it to you, around the country and in New York.
[00:02:40.492 --> 00:02:48.779]  Sound cannons, hover blimps, police arresting people and putting them in private, Merck-controlled, you know, Bechtel, George Shultz camps.
[00:02:50.145 --> 00:02:53.828]  Just incredible stuff where we get threatened with arrest every day.
[00:02:53.828 --> 00:02:57.310]  Then we spend an hour on who carried out 9-11.
[00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.312]  We confront Michael Moore for whitewashing.
[00:03:00.312 --> 00:03:04.354]  We confront David Gergen about being a member of a satanic organization.
[00:03:04.354 --> 00:03:07.136]  And he blows up and admits it all.
[00:03:07.136 --> 00:03:09.217]  That's the Karl Rove of four administrations.
[00:03:10.805 --> 00:03:16.170]  Look, we just go where the truth leads us, and it is a bizarre and shocking and powerful film.
[00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.013]  We've also got American Dictators, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror.
[00:03:20.013 --> 00:03:29.322]  I'm carrying Joyce Riley and William Lewis's new powerful film, Beyond Treason, about the government knowingly testing chemical and biologicals on troops.
[00:03:29.978 --> 00:03:31.219]  Killing them in many cases?
[00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:33.379]  I mean, this shows you who the government is.
[00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:34.600]  Criminals, folks.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.520]  Criminals have got control of the government.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.502]  We've got that video, a lot of other books and videos.

[00:04:37.274 --> 00:04:39.255]  For being a member of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:04:39.255 --> 00:04:41.275]  Gotta have some way to pay for the bandwidth.
[00:04:41.275 --> 00:04:43.196]  15 cents a day, I'm sure you can afford it.
[00:04:43.196 --> 00:04:45.177]  Alright, going to Tom Plonko.
[00:04:45.177 --> 00:04:46.957]  Tom, been on many, many times.
[00:04:46.957 --> 00:04:49.198]  Just does a great job.
[00:04:49.198 --> 00:04:50.759]  And Tom, it's good to have you on with us.
[00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:51.859]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[00:04:52.685 --> 00:04:53.466]  Good.
[00:04:53.466 --> 00:04:59.269]  I know that you've had some intelligence groups, Group 5 and others, trying to go after you.
[00:04:59.269 --> 00:05:09.515]  And we've tracked a lot of these groups back to kind of these shadowy private merc groups that are really government, but are privately run, like the prisons and everything else.
[00:05:09.515 --> 00:05:10.896]  But that doesn't matter.
[00:05:10.896 --> 00:05:15.719]  You're reporting on things that are very important, and it's good to have you on with us.
[00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:16.740]  Well, thank you very much, Alex.
[00:05:17.822 --> 00:05:36.809]  As you know, the last couple stories, the financial terrorism towers over 9-11, and my report about the Bush-Cheney indictments, as you said to me on the pre-production issues, we were discussing that there is a criminal grand jury that's convened in Chicago.
[00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:45.292]  And a lot of people don't realize this, that there are facilities for 6, 7, 8 grand juries within that building.
[00:05:45.936 --> 00:05:50.777]  You know, and so I've been told that there are other groups.
[00:05:50.777 --> 00:05:51.997]  We don't know how many.
[00:05:51.997 --> 00:05:53.358]  I don't know where they all are.
[00:05:53.358 --> 00:05:54.358]  I don't know what cities.
[00:05:54.358 --> 00:05:57.538]  I don't know what, you know, the locations, that kind of thing.
[00:05:57.538 --> 00:06:07.620]  But we know that in Chicago itself that there are individuals working there, and they're intently been working over, oh, like a year, year and a half or so regarding this issue.
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.721]  And from what I understand now,
[00:06:11.234 --> 00:06:21.000]  That they're going a little deeper than the Valerie Plain because, you know, you get one piece of evidence and then it steps on another piece and it leads to another leg in another direction.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.842]  So, right off the bat... Well, let's be clear.
[00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:29.245]  People have gone to prison at Enron, which the Bushes were neck deep in.
[00:06:29.245 --> 00:06:31.947]  I mean, Alberto Gonzalez was an Enron lawyer.
[00:06:31.947 --> 00:06:34.648]  I mean, they're their biggest contributors.
[00:06:34.648 --> 00:06:35.809]  They were heavily invested.
[00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:39.411]  They're involved, though, in things much bigger than that.
[00:06:39.411 --> 00:06:41.613]  The trillion's missing from the Pentagon.
[00:06:41.613 --> 00:06:43.234]  We have the House hearings on that.
[00:06:43.234 --> 00:06:45.936]  I mean, they're involved in bid rigging.
[00:06:45.936 --> 00:06:51.860]  They're involved in... Cheney openly gives contracts to his wife on the board of Lockheed Martin.
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.402]  You're like a veritable fact factory.
[00:06:54.402 --> 00:06:56.043]  I stay into one in certain areas.
[00:06:56.043 --> 00:07:00.626]  And when you put all that news up, it's absolutely incredible what's going on.
[00:07:00.626 --> 00:07:01.387]  But when you look back
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.981]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[00:07:05.981 --> 00:07:20.505]  I mean, you're giving us the background right now, but let's, and we'll go into all that, because it's mainstream news about drug dealing and money laundering and, I mean, folks, Bill Clinton pardons
[00:07:21.545 --> 00:07:23.947]  Giant coke dealers, you know, giving money in the White House.
[00:07:23.947 --> 00:07:25.148]  I mean, it's public.
[00:07:25.148 --> 00:07:26.428]  But I mean, all of this goes on.
[00:07:26.428 --> 00:07:28.250]  I mean, our government deals with drugs.
[00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.872]  The Bushes are the biggest crime family in America, you know, that we publicly know about.
[00:07:31.872 --> 00:07:35.655]  I mean, they are a crime family for 60 years, 70 years.
[00:07:35.655 --> 00:07:39.978]  But I mean, I want to go back, though, just in a nutshell, the big story is
[00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:44.781]  We know there's criminal grand juries looking at the Valerie Plame issue.
[00:07:44.781 --> 00:07:45.801]  That's admitted.
[00:07:45.801 --> 00:07:48.683]  But then you get intel from sources.
[00:07:48.683 --> 00:07:50.124]  Tell us about those sources.
[00:07:50.124 --> 00:07:51.365]  Tell us specifically.
[00:07:51.365 --> 00:07:57.569]  I have specifically been talking to a fellow by the name of Tom Hennigan from California.
[00:07:57.569 --> 00:08:07.035]  Tom is a broker by trade and he also has sources within intelligence and you know as many of the, if you look at the whole intelligence
[00:08:07.956 --> 00:08:08.336]  I don't know.
[00:08:27.854 --> 00:08:32.138]  I'm going to have to stop you for a second.
[00:08:32.138 --> 00:08:36.581]  No one said that he was.
[00:08:36.581 --> 00:08:46.449]  You moved on after you talked about him and you said many members who were involved in the stock market, you said intelligence.
[00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:51.056]  He's not intelligence.
[00:08:51.056 --> 00:08:54.296]  You talked about a broker, then you talked about intelligence.
[00:08:54.296 --> 00:08:55.477]  Yes, many of them.
[00:08:55.477 --> 00:09:06.920]  And then I said intelligence is in it to make money and in some cases with the PROMIS software to track and trace what different groups are doing.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:07.980]  Right, there you go.
[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.681]  We'll make sure we get that right.
[00:09:09.681 --> 00:09:13.142]  But what I've been told too is that there are many
[00:09:13.894 --> 00:09:39.600]  Thousands of intelligence people who are absolutely fed up with what is going on from going back to the China Missile codes and all that kind of thing up to the 9-11 and now with the issues of the plane Investigation it was kind of almost like a straw that broke the camel's back Because the plane issue there are individuals that are linked to her She was involved in some deep intelligence work the way I understand it at one time and there are people linked to her and of course you have people getting
[00:09:41.139 --> 00:09:47.181]  You know, murdered or whatever over the links that get discovered in something like this.
[00:09:47.181 --> 00:09:52.903]  So, there are a series of issues going on and there are a lot of people in intelligence that are handing over evidence.
[00:09:52.903 --> 00:09:57.885]  And I don't know about the witness situation, but evidence and documents are coming forward.
[00:09:57.885 --> 00:09:58.725]  And they're getting sent.
[00:09:58.725 --> 00:10:03.987]  And Hannigan is just one of many who have carted evidence up to some of these grand juries.
[00:10:03.987 --> 00:10:08.589]  And I happen to know that a lot of evidence has been taken to Elliot Spitzer's
[00:10:09.011 --> 00:10:17.091]  Grand jury up in either it's either in New York or Albany he and uh... what's his name the other Morgenthau and uh... they've done nothing and they've had this evidence for
[00:10:17.938 --> 00:10:19.259]  Six, seven, eight, nine months.
[00:10:19.259 --> 00:10:27.322]  I was about to say, we know that criminal complaints have been filed by families and lawyers with Spitzer and others.
[00:10:27.322 --> 00:10:28.682]  So, again, that's part of the record.
[00:10:28.682 --> 00:10:35.905]  Yeah, his issue, I believe, Alex, is, you know, get the reputation as being a crime buster for, you know, stock market fraud.
[00:10:35.905 --> 00:10:37.085]  And then be a white washer.
[00:10:37.085 --> 00:10:44.308]  But it's linked, yes, but stock market is fraud and people make money off of 9-11 and stock market fraud is involved in all of this.
[00:10:44.787 --> 00:10:49.551]  And, you know, it's like every time you turn over one rock, it leads to another piece of evidence.
[00:10:49.551 --> 00:10:51.892]  You go into one door, it opens up another door.
[00:10:51.892 --> 00:10:55.615]  So those are issues that are going to have to be dealt with.
[00:10:55.615 --> 00:11:00.599]  So if people like Mr. Hannigan is handing over documents,
[00:11:01.238 --> 00:11:03.860]  Uh, through other people or through himself or whatever.
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.082]  He's one of many.
[00:11:05.082 --> 00:11:07.944]  And this evidence is finding its way to the grand jury.
[00:11:07.944 --> 00:11:09.145]  Well, he's doing a great job.
[00:11:09.145 --> 00:11:12.788]  We appreciate him on, you know, folks out there that have these contacts.
[00:11:12.788 --> 00:11:18.173]  But I mean, to go back to why intelligence is mad, and we know this, this has even been in the mainstream news.
[00:11:18.553 --> 00:11:21.438]  I mean, they sell out Valerie Plame and all those under.
[00:11:21.438 --> 00:11:23.802]  They sell out countless other agents.
[00:11:23.802 --> 00:11:25.384]  They're constantly lying.
[00:11:25.384 --> 00:11:28.550]  They're constantly... And look, people aren't dumb in intelligence.
[00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:30.813]  They know other compartmentalized groups carried out 9-11.
[00:11:30.813 --> 00:11:32.155]  Now, Mr. Hannigan says...
[00:11:33.473 --> 00:11:33.833]  Yes, stay there.
[00:11:33.833 --> 00:11:35.414]  Tom Blanco, stay with us, folks.
[00:11:57.509 --> 00:12:00.792]  Gano Café is the new energy drink that's sweeping the globe.
[00:12:00.792 --> 00:12:02.793]  Already a number one beverage in Asia.
[00:12:02.793 --> 00:12:06.716]  Gano Café is the new energy drink for coffee, tea, and cocoa lovers.
[00:12:06.716 --> 00:12:12.720]  What makes Gano Café special is the secret ingredient Reishi, a concentration of six species of red mushroom.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:18.705]  Also known as the miraculous king of herbs, known for its high nutritional value, Reishi packs a bigger punch than ginseng.

[00:12:57.111 --> 00:13:00.453]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:13:00.453 --> 00:13:04.876]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:13:04.876 --> 00:13:07.858]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:13:07.858 --> 00:13:10.460]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:19.285]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:13:19.285 --> 00:13:20.826]  The Berkeley Light is different.
[00:13:20.826 --> 00:13:25.009]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:13:25.329 --> 00:13:26.090]  We're good to go!
[00:13:55.009 --> 00:13:56.851]  Currency devaluation.
[00:13:56.851 --> 00:13:57.251]  Inflation.
[00:13:57.251 --> 00:13:58.132]  One and the same.
[00:13:58.132 --> 00:14:03.418]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:14:15.109 --> 00:14:18.714]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:14:18.714 --> 00:14:19.435]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:14:19.435 --> 00:14:20.796]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:14:20.796 --> 00:14:21.417]  Here is reality.
[00:14:21.417 --> 00:14:24.281]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:14:32.918 --> 00:14:37.342]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:14:37.342 --> 00:14:42.007]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[00:14:42.007 --> 00:14:46.331]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.
[00:14:46.331 --> 00:14:47.833]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.

[00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:02.750]  No more imagining!
[00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:06.772]  It's time to experience the relaxing and rejuvenating Total Health Spa by HTE.
[00:15:06.772 --> 00:15:13.116]  The Total Health Spa consists of two medical devices working together to promote increased circulation and oxygenation.

[00:15:19.079 --> 00:15:21.120]  The Total Health Spa begins with the original.
[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:21.620]  I think so.
[00:15:40.592 --> 00:15:43.033]  It makes you feel absolutely terrific!

[00:15:52.939 --> 00:15:55.140]  So we've got all this criminality going on.
[00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:55.440]  Admittedly.
[00:16:09.796 --> 00:16:26.824]  All these people around El Presidente in the past few years, past four years, being indicted, going to prison, all over the place, and then there are criminal grand juries impaneled, looking at the plane incident, and then we start hearing that they've been indicted.
[00:16:26.824 --> 00:16:28.305]  Now again, I don't know if that's true or not.
[00:16:28.305 --> 00:16:32.687]  I'm going to talk to Tom Flacco about it, but I know this, they can also use these grand juries
[00:16:33.354 --> 00:16:41.519]  To suck up all the data, and to have good people come forward and have whistleblowers blow their whistles there, and then never do anything with it.
[00:16:41.519 --> 00:16:44.020]  I call it kind of a sponge operation.
[00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:50.904]  And I'm not saying that's what's happening here, but they own and run a lot of these federal grand juries, and I know they control these U.S.
[00:16:50.904 --> 00:16:53.545]  attorneys, but we have seen rogue ones in the past.
[00:16:53.545 --> 00:16:59.649]  I don't trust Spitzer as far as you can throw him in New York with the state's office.
[00:17:00.692 --> 00:17:04.955]  But I do know intelligence people are mad and know what's going on.
[00:17:04.955 --> 00:17:06.956]  Tom, finish up what you were trying to say.
[00:17:06.956 --> 00:17:09.038]  You're exactly correct with that issue.
[00:17:09.038 --> 00:17:12.080]  The Spitzer situation is out of control.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.701]  He's not really there.
[00:17:13.701 --> 00:17:15.082]  They're working on securities.
[00:17:15.495 --> 00:17:18.277]  But they're not getting into the 9-11 issues.
[00:17:18.277 --> 00:17:22.179]  There's plenty of evidence, as you know, with regard to the trading and so forth that went on.
[00:17:22.179 --> 00:17:26.061]  And it was more massive than I had known before.
[00:17:26.061 --> 00:17:30.184]  And there was evidence and indications of that, that it's coming forth.
[00:17:30.184 --> 00:17:39.029]  Now also, as far as Mr. Fitzgerald goes, yeah, he's got a lot of authority and there's issues now.
[00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:43.512]  I believe that they can't fire him a la the Archibald Cox situation because
[00:17:44.368 --> 00:17:52.636]  It would be akin to what happened with the Nixon situation, where he tried to cut off future investigation of the criminality.
[00:17:52.636 --> 00:17:56.519]  But what they've got now is a situation where they've got to neuter him or something.
[00:17:56.519 --> 00:18:02.044]  And your issue of the sponge issue is very, very possible.
[00:18:02.044 --> 00:18:08.469]  Seeking and getting information and grabbing and finding out who the witnesses are, find out what the testimony is, the word gets back.
[00:18:08.469 --> 00:18:11.732]  And what's amazing to me, Alex, is here you had
[00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:21.254]  All these individuals, the President, the Vice President, all of his staff, all the counselors, the Attorney General, the former Attorney General, all been subpoenaed that never made the news.
[00:18:21.254 --> 00:18:22.414]  That's news in itself, Alex!
[00:18:22.414 --> 00:18:38.781]  Well, to show you how fake the left-right paradigm is, and how at the top the parties are all together, don't think that Mary Madeline would be allowed to work as a Chief Advisor in the White House for two seconds if Carville wasn't on board.
[00:18:39.701 --> 00:18:41.983]  And this goes back to the Bushes.
[00:18:41.983 --> 00:18:49.947]  We know, being in business with Clinton, and now Barbara calls him son, and he's a surrogate member of the family.
[00:18:49.947 --> 00:18:52.949]  I mean, you've got this husband and wife team.
[00:18:52.949 --> 00:18:59.333]  Mary Madeline and Carville are married, and she's one of the top strategists in the White House.
[00:18:59.333 --> 00:19:02.174]  That's just a side issue.
[00:19:02.174 --> 00:19:06.297]  Yes, that's a very important point, and oftentimes neglected by most people.
[00:19:07.077 --> 00:19:08.298]  You know, not really considered.
[00:19:08.298 --> 00:19:09.538]  There's no question about that.
[00:19:09.538 --> 00:19:18.021]  You've got all these issues and you've got individuals that are there who are a part of this, but you had subpoenas.
[00:19:18.021 --> 00:19:20.462]  All these people went and got subpoenas.
[00:19:20.462 --> 00:19:22.303]  That never made the news.
[00:19:22.303 --> 00:19:24.924]  Then they get to go in and testify.
[00:19:24.924 --> 00:19:25.424]  Think about it.
[00:19:25.424 --> 00:19:33.927]  The President of the United States, the Vice President, Alberto Gonzales, the current Attorney General, former Attorney General Ashcroft, all testifying.
[00:19:34.939 --> 00:19:40.101]  And they've got, if they haven't all testified, at least some of them have testified.
[00:19:40.101 --> 00:19:42.643]  We don't know the details of that, where they testified.
[00:19:42.643 --> 00:19:43.943]  No, I know, I've listened.
[00:19:43.943 --> 00:19:45.984]  That has not made the news, Alex.
[00:19:45.984 --> 00:19:48.285]  That subpoena would be major news.
[00:19:48.285 --> 00:19:50.686]  The testimony would be more major news.
[00:19:50.686 --> 00:19:52.387]  None of it is on the air.
[00:19:52.387 --> 00:19:55.388]  Left-wingers, right-wingers, it's not on the air.
[00:19:55.388 --> 00:19:57.089]  The Democrats aren't talking about it.
[00:19:57.089 --> 00:19:58.850]  Republicans aren't talking about it.
[00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:03.052]  And now I come along and say, in a criminal grand jury where there's been subpoenas, where there have been
[00:20:03.972 --> 00:20:05.313]  There has been testimony.
[00:20:05.313 --> 00:20:14.177]  Now I'm saying that there have been indictments through my source, Thomas Hennigan, who is providing, now think about it, he's providing evidence to the Grand Jury.
[00:20:14.177 --> 00:20:21.720]  Is it possible that he, is it possible that friends around him have sources within or surrounding the Grand Jury?
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.181]  I think it's quite possible.
[00:20:23.181 --> 00:20:25.522]  Now the other reason I went with the Tom Hennigan issue
[00:20:26.238 --> 00:20:29.100]  I've been on the phone with him quite a bit over the last few months.
[00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:36.066]  He has analyzed documents which I didn't understand that well because I had not had the background.
[00:20:36.066 --> 00:20:37.087]  I've had a relationship.
[00:20:37.087 --> 00:20:39.008]  I've heard him on the air.
[00:20:39.008 --> 00:20:41.350]  He is tremendously articulate.
[00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:43.552]  He's a real patriot as far as I'm concerned.
[00:20:43.552 --> 00:20:47.615]  A lot of people are going to say, oh, you're being snookered by somebody that's trying to diss him.
[00:20:47.615 --> 00:20:49.316]  No, not when you talk with somebody.
[00:20:49.316 --> 00:20:52.479]  When I talk to Alex Jones four, five, six, seven times,
[00:20:52.833 --> 00:20:56.114]  You get a little bit about Alex Jones' personality.
[00:20:56.114 --> 00:20:57.175]  Same thing with Jeff Rentsch.
[00:20:57.175 --> 00:21:01.456]  Any of the guys that I go on the air with, you get to know a little bit about them.
[00:21:01.456 --> 00:21:06.278]  I trust this guy and I believe that I'm looking at the documents that he's shown me.
[00:21:06.278 --> 00:21:11.220]  I have some handwriting samples of the people that wrote a couple of these documents myself.
[00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:14.901]  I had them before he showed me what he had and gave them to me.
[00:21:14.901 --> 00:21:19.743]  This other story, which deals with the financial terrorism, is absolutely incredible.
[00:21:20.242 --> 00:21:25.384]  The documents prove that there was knowledge of things going on after the attacks.
[00:21:25.384 --> 00:21:27.425]  And that's where we're getting into 9-11.
[00:21:27.425 --> 00:21:31.266]  And this evidence has also been presented to the grand jury.
[00:21:31.266 --> 00:21:33.107]  All these documents, it's already there.
[00:21:33.107 --> 00:21:38.408]  It's the only reason I was allowed to write about it, because they already have it, they've already discussed it.
[00:21:38.408 --> 00:21:45.331]  And then that ties into Civil Levens, who's saying they're a bunch of drug dealing murderers, basically, in the White House.
[00:21:47.382 --> 00:21:48.783]  We're on the march.
[00:21:48.783 --> 00:21:51.304]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:51.304 --> 00:21:59.247]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:59.247 --> 00:22:06.350]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:08.972]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[00:22:08.972 --> 00:22:11.273]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[00:22:11.273 --> 00:22:16.615]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[00:22:16.995 --> 00:22:21.718]  The Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert was specifically designed to meet this critical crisis need.
[00:22:21.718 --> 00:22:24.480]  Small, portable, and on 24 hours a day.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:29.803]  With its 10-year battery, the Nuke Alert is always with you to alert you to dangerous levels of radiation.
[00:22:29.803 --> 00:22:34.907]  The patented Nuke Alert has even passed the rigorous military EMP test and has been acquired by the U.S.
[00:22:34.907 --> 00:22:36.888]  military and numerous other government agencies.
[00:22:37.408 --> 00:22:40.792]  See the Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert at nukealert.com.

[00:22:57.023 --> 00:22:59.064]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[00:22:59.064 --> 00:23:10.149]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:14.751]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:23:14.751 --> 00:23:26.077]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:23:26.657 --> 00:23:33.902]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:23:33.902 --> 00:23:36.544]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:23:36.544 --> 00:23:41.827]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post-filter elements.

[00:23:56.357 --> 00:23:58.859]  Three-eight.
[00:23:58.859 --> 00:24:01.521]  People in Asia have enjoyed it for thousands of years.
[00:24:01.521 --> 00:24:04.684]  Gourmet Magazine calls it the world's most seductive fruit.
[00:24:04.684 --> 00:24:08.948]  It's the exotic mangosteen, heavenly delicious and packed with nutritional benefits.
[00:24:08.948 --> 00:24:18.256]  From the rainforest of Southeast Asia, the small beautiful mangosteen earns its nickname Queen of Fruit, with a taste that is indescribably blissful and health benefits that are off the charts.
[00:24:18.516 --> 00:24:34.750]  Because Zango is made from the whole mangosteen fruit, it delivers a serious nutrient-packed punch, loaded with xanthomes, which are some of the most powerful antioxidants ever found, fighting hard to support microbiological balance, maintain immune system health, promote joint flexibility, and provide positive mental support and
[00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:35.911]  So much more.
[00:24:35.911 --> 00:24:42.214]  Now you can experience the whole fruit goodness of the Mangosteen with Zango, the original Mangosteen functional health beverage.

[00:25:13.937 --> 00:25:17.621]  Melissa is first, and then Malta, Mark, Jeff, many others.
[00:25:17.621 --> 00:25:21.285]  We'll take some calls for Tom Flogel coming up here in about 10 minutes, so be patient.
[00:25:21.285 --> 00:25:24.388]  But we've got a lot more to talk about here with Tom first.
[00:25:24.388 --> 00:25:30.115]  Tom, you were beginning to get into 9-11 and its connections to this.
[00:25:30.115 --> 00:25:30.795]  Go ahead.
[00:25:30.795 --> 00:25:34.439]  The financial terrorism story, financial terrorism towers over 9-11.
[00:25:35.655 --> 00:25:41.638]  I think it's one of the most heavily sourced things I've ever done, and it's a very, very important story in my opinion.
[00:25:41.638 --> 00:25:49.362]  It deals with White House crime families, and I'm talking about plural here, and it's just incredible stuff.
[00:25:49.362 --> 00:26:04.769]  The issues of the Congressional poll ratings and how they indicate that there's credible evidence that the World Trade Center was taken down by a controlled demolition.
[00:26:05.205 --> 00:26:32.067]  And if you look at the slowed down, slow motion DVDs that are out there all over the internet, one I particularly like, Loose Change, because it's only 59 minutes long, it slows down to a crawl, so you can look at, you can see the explosions coming out of the sides of the tower that many of them have already seen, but I found new flashes that were in the towers that are there, and this kind of stuff is taken from CNN, MSNBC, ABC, NBC broadcast on the day of 9-11.
[00:26:32.992 --> 00:26:35.433]  It's just filled with stuff.
[00:26:35.433 --> 00:26:38.535]  I looked at that material and it just blew my mind.
[00:26:38.535 --> 00:26:43.358]  I had not seen some of the physical or the actual evidence of a visual nature.
[00:26:43.358 --> 00:26:44.259]  And then you've got interviews.
[00:26:44.259 --> 00:26:45.660]  You've got radios in the tower.
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:50.502]  There's bombs going off in the tower on the 4th through the 12th floor.
[00:26:50.502 --> 00:26:52.544]  There's another bomb on the 15th floor.
[00:26:52.544 --> 00:26:54.945]  You have radio things that are out there.
[00:26:54.945 --> 00:26:59.388]  A lot of these DVCs carry them where you can actually hear the radio calls.
[00:26:59.388 --> 00:27:01.509]  None of this was carried by the 9-11 Commission.
[00:27:01.949 --> 00:27:09.374]  None of it was played, and they didn't bring in the firemen, they didn't bring in any of the real evidence of the towers being collapsed.
[00:27:09.374 --> 00:27:13.397]  I sat there in those hearings, and I saw the thing, I witnessed it.
[00:27:13.397 --> 00:27:30.349]  It was basically a fraud and a cover-up that was masked under what looked to be an educational and very astute set of words and documents and so forth, but it was more like a novel than it was really an investigation.
[00:27:30.891 --> 00:27:37.813]  You know, and then Sabel Edmonds, well that whole issue, I wrote four stories and I had four interviews with Sabel Edmonds.
[00:27:37.813 --> 00:27:45.375]  The last one I did at her press conference dealt with the issue of her court case, which now she's trying to appeal to the Supreme Court.
[00:27:45.375 --> 00:27:57.217]  In essence, she said she heard things, or she actually translated and went through intercepts that translated these intercepts, which indicated that there were individuals in the United States government.
[00:27:57.217 --> 00:27:59.098]  Now, I've interviewed Sabel enough times
[00:27:59.628 --> 00:28:04.710]  Now, this is the fourth time to know that I had to make up questions that would be denial things.
[00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:18.576]  So I approached her with the issue, Sabel, do you deny that there were a number of Americans that you heard the names of famous American politicians and political leaders and famous heads of federal agencies?
[00:28:18.576 --> 00:28:21.218]  Do you deny that there were ten or so?
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.983]  On the tapes that you heard and she said I will not deny that.
[00:28:25.983 --> 00:28:30.086]  So I got a non-denial out of her because she is gagged, you know, but she said no.
[00:28:30.086 --> 00:28:32.648]  Those that don't know, I mean, they're threatening to arrest her.
[00:28:32.648 --> 00:28:35.570]  It's the same thing with FBI agent Robert Wright and others.
[00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:37.071]  Exactly, that's right.
[00:28:37.071 --> 00:28:38.652]  Alex, you're right on the money with that.
[00:28:38.652 --> 00:28:39.273]  Exactly right.
[00:28:39.273 --> 00:28:40.193]  Wright's another one.
[00:28:40.193 --> 00:28:44.116]  He broke down in his interview with Larry Claymore on C-SPAN.
[00:28:44.116 --> 00:28:44.757]  I saw it.
[00:28:44.757 --> 00:28:45.857]  But the issue here is that
[00:28:47.413 --> 00:28:48.334]  Hear what we're saying.
[00:28:48.334 --> 00:28:49.375]  What is she saying here?
[00:28:49.375 --> 00:28:59.141]  She's saying that ten famous American political leaders, and I think one of them was a former president, she would not admit that, but she smiled, you know,
[00:29:00.467 --> 00:29:10.791]  That ten famous American political leaders and heads of federal agencies were involved in drug money laundering and financing the 9-11 attacks!
[00:29:10.791 --> 00:29:13.353]  Now, how more specific can you get?
[00:29:13.353 --> 00:29:17.634]  And you can see that the woman is facing a lot of pressure.
[00:29:17.634 --> 00:29:18.875]  You know about Mary Schneider.
[00:29:18.875 --> 00:29:20.075]  What happened with her?
[00:29:20.075 --> 00:29:20.956]  She's lost her home.
[00:29:20.956 --> 00:29:24.377]  She's basically going to go homeless in the next couple weeks, it's going to be.
[00:29:24.377 --> 00:29:25.998]  And because she exposed
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:33.591]  Uh, the fact that there were illegal Muslim rings running around in Florida and our own Congressman Rick Keller wouldn't do anything about it.
[00:29:33.591 --> 00:29:39.661]  I flew down there and talked to his chief of staff and he just looked at me smiling and said, well, that's not our prerogative.
[00:29:40.331 --> 00:29:41.993]  We can't investigate this.
[00:29:41.993 --> 00:29:44.935]  I said, how come you can't?
[00:29:44.935 --> 00:29:47.918]  Congressman Keller is a member of the Terrorism Subcommittee.
[00:29:47.918 --> 00:29:53.303]  Now, if he can't investigate terrorism cells in his own congressional district, then who can?
[00:29:53.303 --> 00:29:55.745]  And then I went over and I crossed the street.
[00:29:55.745 --> 00:29:59.549]  Literally, I crossed the street in Orlando and I walked into the office of
[00:30:00.203 --> 00:30:02.645]  Of Senator Nelson, the Democrat.
[00:30:02.645 --> 00:30:05.407]  And I talked to one of his top staff aides.
[00:30:05.407 --> 00:30:07.008]  She said, we can't investigate this.
[00:30:07.008 --> 00:30:07.949]  And the same thing.
[00:30:07.949 --> 00:30:08.529]  It's a run around.
[00:30:08.529 --> 00:30:12.913]  Well, if you can't investigate terrorism in your own state, which senator is going to do it?
[00:30:12.913 --> 00:30:15.214]  Somebody from Nebraska or Ohio or someplace?
[00:30:15.214 --> 00:30:18.197]  So what we have here is people are looking the other way.
[00:30:18.197 --> 00:30:19.738]  They're winking and nodding.
[00:30:19.738 --> 00:30:26.723]  And trust me, Alex, there are going to be senators and congressmen that are under investigation right now, secretively,
[00:30:27.552 --> 00:30:42.542]  I don't know as far as the Grand Jury, but I'll tell you what, I've been hearing this, that there are going to be individuals who are going to face some investigation with regard to this and this whole cover-up, because they saw the same intelligence briefing that the President saw, maybe a little more redacted.
[00:30:42.542 --> 00:30:50.167]  When I looked at that, there was mention of that in one of the hearings that went along that the Senate had before they punted the ball over to the 9-11 Commission.
[00:30:50.495 --> 00:30:56.337]  But the issue there is that there are congressmen and senators on the Intelligence Committee who are looking the other way.
[00:30:56.337 --> 00:30:59.538]  And I'll tell you, it is infuriating a lot of Americans.
[00:30:59.538 --> 00:31:01.658]  But guess who it's infuriating more?
[00:31:01.658 --> 00:31:11.981]  It's infuriating the intelligence patriots, guys who have families just like you and me, and they're seeing this whole thing just basically being taken down.
[00:31:11.981 --> 00:31:15.142]  And because the media has total control over things,
[00:31:15.598 --> 00:31:17.079]  You know, there's another issue.
[00:31:17.079 --> 00:31:19.941]  There are going to be media people that are involved.
[00:31:19.941 --> 00:31:21.702]  But getting back into the story now.
[00:31:21.702 --> 00:31:25.364]  I started to talk about paper shredding.
[00:31:25.364 --> 00:31:32.568]  Hennigan said that he has heard through sources, that the investigation, that there has been evidence of document shredding in the White House.
[00:31:33.192 --> 00:31:57.820]  That's a pretty strong charge, and he said, well, he said that what we're hearing is that Mary Madeline and Karl Rove have been indicted, or have been, they're true bills, I believe, there are people that are more legal than I am on this thing, but the grand jury has to vote what Porter called true bills, and those are what are handed down, and they have not been publicized yet.
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:00.221]  Now, the problem here is that
[00:32:01.334 --> 00:32:06.177]  We know, and this runs into a lot of legs, what happens to those true bills?
[00:32:06.177 --> 00:32:07.698]  Can they control the grand jury?
[00:32:07.698 --> 00:32:09.880]  Can they control the prosecutor?
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:10.720]  Can they get evidence?
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.081]  Can they be sponges?
[00:32:12.081 --> 00:32:14.303]  Can they blow up the building?
[00:32:14.303 --> 00:32:23.509]  Now I just got news, one of my researchers, and actually it's a great patriotic woman, Mary Snyder, called me this morning before the show and she said, Tom, you've got to see this.
[00:32:23.905 --> 00:32:31.771]  There is a website, a paper that's been active since 1905, just reporting general Chicago news.
[00:32:31.771 --> 00:32:44.380]  And she said that this paper reported that prior to the 18th, just a few days prior to the 18th, when CIA sources are saying that there was an attempt
[00:32:44.744 --> 00:32:57.927]  There was a disturbance in the Chicago subway, and that subway, where that disturbance was, is right underneath the Dirksen Federal Building, where Fitzgerald and his grand jury are hearing testimony, and witnesses, and documents, and reviewing documents.
[00:32:57.927 --> 00:33:04.548]  So there was an attempt to cause a disturbance, to possibly blow up the subway area underneath.
[00:33:04.548 --> 00:33:12.010]  And we found that there were reports by the Chicago Tribune that they evacuated that subway during the time period when I was told this happened.
[00:33:12.381 --> 00:33:18.162]  And so that was kind of a... And then in a local newspaper, a hit report, I saw that about the supposed shootout, and then that would fit going back a few months ago when the grand jury was already impaneled.
[00:33:18.162 --> 00:33:19.582]  No, this was on the 18th of July, Alex.
[00:33:19.582 --> 00:33:20.123]  This just happened.
[00:33:20.123 --> 00:33:21.403]  That's not what I was going to say.
[00:33:21.403 --> 00:33:22.303]  That's not what I was going to say.
[00:33:22.303 --> 00:33:23.303]  That's not what I was going to say.
[00:33:23.303 --> 00:33:24.363]  That's not what I was going to say.
[00:33:24.363 --> 00:33:25.324]  That's not what I was going to say.
[00:33:25.324 --> 00:33:26.324]  That's not what I was going to say.
[00:33:26.324 --> 00:33:27.344]  That's not what I was going to say.
[00:33:27.344 --> 00:33:28.264]  That's not what I was going to say.
[00:33:28.264 --> 00:33:29.064]  That's not what I was going to say.
[00:33:29.064 --> 00:33:30.044]  That's not what I was going to say.
[00:33:30.044 --> 00:33:31.025]  That's not what I was going to say.
[00:33:31.025 --> 00:33:32.465]  That's not what I was going to say.
[00:33:32.465 --> 00:33:33.885]  That's not what I was going to say.
[00:33:33.885 --> 00:33:34.865]  That's not what I was going to say.
[00:33:34.865 --> 00:33:36.226]  That's not what I was going to say.
[00:33:36.226 --> 00:33:37.866]  That's not what I was going to
[00:33:38.365 --> 00:33:52.313]  And what Mary told me is that this report said that they disbanded an emergency management group which they reactivated three days after the attempt on July the 18th.
[00:33:52.313 --> 00:33:57.876]  So what you had was a stand down before and then a reactivation of the same group.
[00:33:57.876 --> 00:34:00.037]  Send me the link and I will put it up.
[00:34:00.037 --> 00:34:00.658]  Sure.
[00:34:00.658 --> 00:34:06.321]  Tom, let me comment on what I was going to say so it's not just the first three words and people can then come and speculate on those three words.
[00:34:07.262 --> 00:34:15.050]  What I said is, that goes back then a few months, it could, to the London bombings on 7-7 and 7-21.
[00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:21.258]  The way intelligence works, if what you're saying is correct, and again this is just cloak and dagger speculation,
[00:34:22.539 --> 00:34:33.225]  Going back a few months, that would make perfect sense of trying to create a ledger or a history that, oh, there's a threat of bombings, which also helps the whole war agenda period.
[00:34:33.225 --> 00:34:38.448]  Then if you did have a bombing that just so happened to be under that federal building, it wouldn't look as suspicious.
[00:34:38.448 --> 00:34:39.769]  Yep, we're expecting it, yeah.
[00:34:40.189 --> 00:34:48.175]  Well, that's an issue that really has to be... And also in England, in England they had them stand down.
[00:34:48.175 --> 00:34:52.458]  They had the security stand down one month before the bombings.
[00:34:52.458 --> 00:34:55.520]  Here we have, I'm going to put this up, this is what she came up with.
[00:34:55.894 --> 00:35:08.405]  This is amazing stuff, and I'm going to put this up there because here is evidence that there was a stand down on security right before... Well, I saw that a week and a half ago about how there were reports of a shootout on the subway.
[00:35:08.405 --> 00:35:16.152]  Yeah, well, boy, the thing about it is, again, you're looking for, you know, was there something that went on, and obviously there was.
[00:35:16.152 --> 00:35:18.894]  They evacuated everybody out of the subway for about 45-50 minutes.
[00:35:21.136 --> 00:35:24.819]  Well, we have confirmed that there were shootouts in London.
[00:35:24.819 --> 00:35:29.703]  There have been multiple shootouts on 7-7 and after, and then that's just kept quiet.
[00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:33.432]  And then they go in houses and shoot people, and that's for quiet.
[00:35:33.432 --> 00:35:37.094]  And then they chase down this electrician who's got the military M.O.
[00:35:37.094 --> 00:35:38.555]  Shoot him eight times in the head.
[00:35:38.555 --> 00:35:40.817]  Turns out he wasn't wearing a coat.
[00:35:40.817 --> 00:35:42.638]  Turns out he didn't run from them.
[00:35:42.638 --> 00:35:44.399]  By the way, that's all confirmed now.
[00:35:44.399 --> 00:35:48.401]  They just... Special Branch... I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:35:48.401 --> 00:35:52.764]  It's just absolutely incredible when this kind of stuff happens.
[00:35:53.191 --> 00:35:55.973]  People just say, well, you know, can we believe this?
[00:35:55.973 --> 00:35:57.333]  Why would they stop you, Tom?
[00:35:57.333 --> 00:36:10.881]  For those that haven't heard about all this, and I have, we've had hundreds of deaths in one month alone in South Texas, car bombs going off in Dallas, dozens and dozens of police killed on both sides.
[00:36:10.881 --> 00:36:11.882]  We have had literal
[00:36:13.042 --> 00:36:18.347]  Travel advisories more dangerous than Israel, State Department advisories, the U.S.
[00:36:18.347 --> 00:36:28.735]  Consulate's mission closing rocket attacks, and it's a few blurbs, but nobody I've talked to, even people that watch the border, no one's aware of this!
[00:36:28.735 --> 00:36:29.876]  When is this going on, Alex?
[00:36:29.876 --> 00:36:31.938]  You're talking now?
[00:36:31.938 --> 00:36:36.982]  Yeah, and this is just an example of how they can keep stuff quiet.
[00:36:36.982 --> 00:36:38.563]  Well, can you imagine?
[00:36:38.563 --> 00:36:39.444]  Well, see, the point is,
[00:36:40.131 --> 00:36:49.391]  You know, if you can squelch the indictments, if you can discredit anybody that's reporting any information, they won't confirm the subpoenas, they won't confirm the testimony.
[00:36:50.034 --> 00:36:50.594]  You know?
[00:36:50.594 --> 00:36:52.435]  Now, I've seen grand juries.
[00:36:52.435 --> 00:36:56.355]  I mean, if a grand jury's not doing an investigation, they'll say, no, we're not investigating that.
[00:36:56.355 --> 00:36:58.676]  No, we've no-billed that.
[00:36:58.676 --> 00:37:02.497]  No, we're not looking at that evidence right now.
[00:37:02.497 --> 00:37:03.997]  We're not in session for that.
[00:37:03.997 --> 00:37:05.137]  They're not.
[00:37:05.137 --> 00:37:07.838]  This individual is not the product of an investigation.
[00:37:07.838 --> 00:37:10.239]  But no, they just say, no comment, no comment, no comment.
[00:37:10.239 --> 00:37:13.359]  You know, I was on Bill Boucher's WLW out of Cincinnati.
[00:37:13.359 --> 00:37:14.339]  50,000 watched 38 states the other night.
[00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:36.235]  And he told me, he was so amazed, he went and literally picked up the telephone and he called Patrick Fitzgerald's office and he hammered him and he says, we will not comment on this, we will not, it is our policy not to comment on this, we will not deny it, we will not confirm it or deny it.
[00:37:36.235 --> 00:37:44.121]  So we have issues that, and there are plenty of citizens that I get emails from that they called the grand jury and these people will not throw water on this thing, they will not
[00:37:44.574 --> 00:37:46.895]  Deny what's happened.
[00:37:46.895 --> 00:37:53.417]  What we have to do now is we have to figure, well, you know, would the indictments come down?
[00:37:53.417 --> 00:37:55.898]  And will we have sponge operations?
[00:37:55.898 --> 00:38:00.160]  Do we have issues of the prosecutor?
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:00.920]  Is he going to come through?
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.942]  We believe that he is going to do so.
[00:38:03.942 --> 00:38:08.683]  Now, a lot of the stuff that I've been reporting on is heavily document driven.
[00:38:08.683 --> 00:38:12.425]  This financial terrorism story has two documents in it right near the top.
[00:38:13.001 --> 00:38:17.825]  Which are letters from the United States Asia Intel Ops to Vice President Cheney.
[00:38:17.825 --> 00:38:23.990]  One of the documents says that there were boxes of cash leaving the Philippines right after 9-11.
[00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:36.200]  Now, in the typical chain of custody, the Vice President on a letter like this would hand this document, which came from a former Swiss Ambassador to Somalia, Leo Wanta.
[00:38:36.935 --> 00:38:41.098]  Uh, and I have other documents, uh, that with his handwriting, I checked it down.
[00:38:41.098 --> 00:38:44.181]  I asked, uh... Okay, but what does this... I mean, what does it mean?
[00:38:44.181 --> 00:38:50.346]  What does this mean is that boxes of cash were leaving the Philippines right after 9-11.
[00:38:50.346 --> 00:38:57.031]  Part of the issue was the boxes were used to finance what are called Foundations Legal Groups.
[00:38:57.031 --> 00:39:05.898]  And I've been told that the Foundations Legal Groups had links to financing drug money laundering, financing the 9-11 attacks, those kinds of issues.
[00:39:06.232 --> 00:39:08.459]  This evidence has already been handed to the grand jury.
[00:39:08.459 --> 00:39:10.125]  They have already been looking at it.
[00:39:12.927 --> 00:39:21.533]  It also deals with the fact that there's a chain of custody to the Vice President, to the President, to the National Security... But here's the question, how do you get a U.S.
[00:39:21.533 --> 00:39:24.675]  Attorney to call in a grand jury?
[00:39:24.675 --> 00:39:28.997]  I mean, just, I'm gonna tell you, Tom, I think you're a good reporter.
[00:39:28.997 --> 00:39:31.199]  I think, I mean, we know there's criminal investigations.
[00:39:31.199 --> 00:39:32.380]  I'm not saying you're wrong.
[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:33.781]  I believe you're being told this.
[00:39:33.781 --> 00:39:35.522]  I know there's documents of criminality.
[00:39:35.522 --> 00:39:37.263]  I know what Civil Levins has, you know, said.
[00:39:37.944 --> 00:39:40.526]  But the point is, I just find it hard to believe that a U.S.
[00:39:40.526 --> 00:39:43.088]  Attorney would do this to begin with.
[00:39:43.088 --> 00:39:56.920]  I've been told that Valerie Plame was involved, circuitously at least, with an investigation of 9-11, or events and money surrounding 9-11.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.461]  That was part of it.
[00:39:58.461 --> 00:40:04.246]  And that issue brings the whole thing, it's like picking up, opening a door and another door opens.
[00:40:04.696 --> 00:40:06.137]  Then another door opens.
[00:40:06.137 --> 00:40:11.840]  The other document... See, the point is, why is Cash leaving the Philippines?
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:15.522]  Why does the President have to know about Cash leaving the Philippines?
[00:40:15.522 --> 00:40:16.502]  What is it for?
[00:40:16.502 --> 00:40:18.424]  What are these foundations groups for?
[00:40:18.424 --> 00:40:26.628]  There was another document in there, which was written to the Vice President from WANTA, and it said, United States Asia Intel Ops.
[00:40:26.628 --> 00:40:28.669]  The document is posted online.
[00:40:28.669 --> 00:40:29.650]  I got it from Spoo Web.
[00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:30.010]  I said, Spoo,
[00:40:30.775 --> 00:40:32.495]  He called me up and said, you've got to look at this.
[00:40:32.495 --> 00:40:35.356]  And I said, how long has this document been on your website?
[00:40:35.356 --> 00:40:37.016]  It's goodweb.com.
[00:40:37.016 --> 00:40:39.837]  He said, it's been up there for almost 3, 4, 5 months.
[00:40:39.837 --> 00:40:41.277]  I said, you're kidding me!
[00:40:41.277 --> 00:40:44.918]  This second document was written to the Vice President from Watan.
[00:40:44.918 --> 00:40:57.880]  He said, United States Asia Intel Ops is of the opinion that the individual who is sitting in the corner next to Osama Bin Laden in the White House released Osama Bin Laden, quote, terrorist scare tape,
[00:40:58.658 --> 00:41:07.062]  Was an individual that met with, 30 days after the 9-11 attacks, an individual who was an FBI special agent in charge.
[00:41:07.062 --> 00:41:13.165]  Now why is, which leads me to the question, why is an FBI agent special in charge, special agent in charge?
[00:41:13.675 --> 00:41:21.497]  Meeting with, ostensibly representing the United States, meeting with one of the associates of Osama Bin Laden 30 days after the attack.
[00:41:21.497 --> 00:41:22.437]  Well, let me just stop you.
[00:41:22.437 --> 00:41:35.381]  We know that the MI6 minion, who they say is the mass bomber, is MI6 and is being protected.
[00:41:35.381 --> 00:41:36.141]  That's admitted.
[00:41:36.141 --> 00:41:41.923]  I mean, it just came out that the big scientist Khan, that the CIA wanted him released decades ago, and
[00:41:43.712 --> 00:41:45.974]  The Belgian ambassador has gone public on that.
[00:41:45.974 --> 00:41:48.156]  So we've seen this time and time again.
[00:41:48.156 --> 00:41:50.519]  I mean, we know that they control Al-Qaeda.
[00:41:50.519 --> 00:41:52.540]  We know they do all of that.
[00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:56.684]  But I mean, I still go back to documents floating around on the internet.
[00:41:56.684 --> 00:41:58.166]  I mean, have you called that ambassador?
[00:41:58.166 --> 00:41:59.247]  Have you talked to him?
[00:41:59.247 --> 00:42:01.269]  I have talked to Leo once, and not recently.
[00:42:01.269 --> 00:42:02.570]  I've talked to him in the past.
[00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:03.271]  But have you talked to him?
[00:42:03.271 --> 00:42:04.872]  Has he confirmed this document?
[00:42:04.872 --> 00:42:07.715]  That document is his handwriting.
[00:42:08.254 --> 00:42:11.837]  I did not, I have not been able to reach, because I don't have his telephone number.
[00:42:11.837 --> 00:42:12.557]  I have not called him.
[00:42:12.557 --> 00:42:16.740]  It's an authentic document according to intelligence sources, that's for sure.
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:19.803]  I have, I can match up that document with his handwriting.
[00:42:19.803 --> 00:42:24.666]  It has the typical line drawn in there, and I recognize his printing, because I have copies of his printing.
[00:42:24.666 --> 00:42:25.887]  You know, and I matched it up that way.
[00:42:25.887 --> 00:42:31.672]  Now, those issues, regardless, if, where is the, where is the scream?
[00:42:31.672 --> 00:42:32.813]  That evidence is screaming.
[00:42:32.813 --> 00:42:35.915]  Hey, Mr. Vice President, Mr. President, can you explain this stuff?
[00:42:37.217 --> 00:42:41.299]  It's not on our responsibility to find this out.
[00:42:41.299 --> 00:42:43.760]  It's on their part to explain this.
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:47.362]  And I believe it has been explained or it is being looked into.
[00:42:47.362 --> 00:42:47.963]  I'm sure of that.
[00:42:47.963 --> 00:42:54.286]  Alright, we're going to take some calls from Melissa and Malta and Mark and Jeff and others when we get back.
[00:42:54.286 --> 00:42:57.927]  Stay with us.

[00:46:04.026 --> 00:46:06.748]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:46:08.061 --> 00:46:15.670]  Well I really appreciate investigative journalist Tom Flacco coming on with us and I'm just going to try to hold him a little bit the next hour so we can get to all your calls.
[00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:19.814]  We're about to go to Melissa in Florida first during this hour.
[00:46:19.814 --> 00:46:23.759]  But Tom, I didn't know until I talked to you during the break, I didn't know this was the first
[00:46:24.421 --> 00:46:25.502]  I don't know all the specifics.
[00:46:25.502 --> 00:46:29.105]  I don't know if this is a deep intel disinfo op on multiple sides.
[00:46:29.105 --> 00:46:30.727]  I don't know if it's a honeypot.
[00:46:46.180 --> 00:47:07.858]  I know there's criminal investigations going on, and if somebody gets indicted for valory blame out of this grand jury, we know that basically confirms a lot of this, but you are getting this from sources inside of there, and this is really scary because it means that the globalists are in a box right now, Tom.
[00:47:07.858 --> 00:47:13.122]  Yeah, I'm getting it from sources who are providing the evidence to the grand jury, the documents.
[00:47:14.286 --> 00:47:15.147]  Witnesses.
[00:47:15.147 --> 00:47:15.987]  Evidence.
[00:47:15.987 --> 00:47:17.428]  That's all.
[00:47:17.428 --> 00:47:20.190]  Well, that's amazing.
[00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:25.054]  But they're able to confirm that this grand jury is empaneled and is doing this.
[00:47:25.054 --> 00:47:33.920]  Yeah, I think there's more than one, and I have not nailed this down, but I personally think there's more than one grand jury.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:42.447]  I think one grand jury... There were reports I saw circulating around the internet that they're getting into this Vanity Fair stuff about all of the
[00:47:43.557 --> 00:48:00.381]  Um, all of the, uh, William McClellan, all the, um, the individuals who have testified in the, uh, with regard, I don't know whether they've testified or not, I could say that there are individuals out there related to the Vanity Fair story about the Supreme Court in the 2000 election.
[00:48:00.381 --> 00:48:02.041]  That's been floating around.
[00:48:02.041 --> 00:48:03.262]  And I have not confirmed any of that.
[00:48:03.262 --> 00:48:04.482]  Now, what about the Tony Blair thing?
[00:48:04.482 --> 00:48:05.682]  What about the Tony Blair thing?
[00:48:05.682 --> 00:48:09.263]  Because I don't think an American Grand Jury can indict Tony Blair.
[00:48:10.723 --> 00:48:19.245]  The issue is that they have subpoenaed Tony Blair to come and testify.
[00:48:19.245 --> 00:48:21.326]  I didn't say he was indicted, I don't believe.
[00:48:21.326 --> 00:48:24.266]  In that story, it said that he had been subpoenaed.
[00:48:24.266 --> 00:48:26.967]  Well, there's also a lot of disinfo about your stories going around.
[00:48:26.967 --> 00:48:32.428]  You've never retracted anything, and there are people claiming that you've retracted the story, and you haven't done that.
[00:48:32.428 --> 00:48:32.628]  Oh, no.
[00:48:32.628 --> 00:48:33.489]  You know what happened?
[00:48:33.489 --> 00:48:33.669]  Yes.
[00:48:35.422 --> 00:48:49.514]  Is that my webmaster and I just talked to the black box voting people and my webmaster did work with her site and she just told me five minutes before your show when I was on the cell phone which your producer can confirm the conversation.
[00:48:49.514 --> 00:48:56.480]  We were talking back and forth and she told me that she was locked out of her website by the same individual.
[00:48:58.368 --> 00:48:59.970]  Let me just say this.
[00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:04.036]  It's funny because I've interviewed Bev Harris about 20 times.
[00:49:04.036 --> 00:49:06.899]  And a year, two years ago, this went on for a year.
[00:49:06.899 --> 00:49:08.882]  She said, never talk about it on air.
[00:49:08.882 --> 00:49:10.765]  But yes, this has happened.
[00:49:10.765 --> 00:49:11.045]  And then...
[00:49:12.455 --> 00:49:17.321]  Now that is interesting.
[00:49:17.321 --> 00:49:27.313]  The point is I was warned that there was a possible infiltration situation going on by intelligent sources and so I decided to move my site.
[00:49:27.313 --> 00:49:28.415]  That warning came
[00:49:29.272 --> 00:49:32.334]  That came after some of my problems started.
[00:49:32.334 --> 00:49:39.858]  I think I started having trouble getting documents, you know, some PDF files and things that I don't have the capability of doing because I don't have the machinery and so forth.
[00:49:39.858 --> 00:49:50.104]  Well, the point is I tried to post this story, the indictment story, onto my website through my normal procedures of using my web posting editor and I was locked out of it.
[00:49:50.104 --> 00:49:53.266]  And I remember Beverly saying this thing, she was locked out of her story.
[00:49:53.266 --> 00:49:55.587]  I said, oh man, what am I going to do?
[00:49:55.587 --> 00:49:56.828]  I want to report this.
[00:49:56.828 --> 00:49:57.408]  So what I did
[00:49:58.209 --> 00:50:11.299]  The only thing that was open was my forums, because there was all the crazies, you know, that are posting, and all kinds of people, great patriots, but also the negative ones, the ones that come out of the woodwork that they put on all of our sites.
[00:50:11.299 --> 00:50:20.065]  Well, what happened was, I decided to log in as Joe Public, and I posted that story on my own forums, captured the URL, and sent that URL out.
[00:50:20.065 --> 00:50:23.488]  Okay, just stay there, Tom, and for those that
[00:50:25.174 --> 00:50:27.896]  For those that are just joining us, we're talking to Tom Plotka.
[00:50:27.896 --> 00:50:30.038]  And I'm sure that's all just a coincidence with the webmaster.
[00:50:30.038 --> 00:50:31.839]  I'm sure they're doing a great job.
[00:50:31.839 --> 00:50:36.803]  We'll be right back with Bird Hour.
[00:50:36.803 --> 00:50:41.467]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.

[00:50:57.841 --> 00:50:59.422]  Well, so does he.
[00:50:59.422 --> 00:51:03.585]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:03.585 --> 00:51:07.928]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:51:07.928 --> 00:51:12.792]  Alright, folks, we're talking to Tom Flocko at TomFlocko.com.
[00:51:12.792 --> 00:51:13.913]  Sites up.
[00:51:13.913 --> 00:51:16.114]  They will get in there and get his info up to you.
[00:51:16.114 --> 00:51:20.838]  Investigative journalists just... When you get into his spoken backer stuff, it gets pretty confusing, but...
[00:51:22.447 --> 00:51:22.887]  I know this.
[00:51:22.887 --> 00:51:26.808]  There's crooks and criminals all around every modern president.
[00:51:26.808 --> 00:51:29.189]  There are a lot of criminal investigations.
[00:51:29.189 --> 00:51:31.450]  We know that's going on.
[00:51:31.450 --> 00:51:34.631]  There is a criminal investigation of the Valerie Plame situation.
[00:51:34.631 --> 00:51:36.291]  That's been in the news.
[00:51:36.291 --> 00:51:37.232]  How deep does it go?
[00:51:37.232 --> 00:51:39.392]  I still don't know.
[00:51:39.392 --> 00:51:47.695]  Tom Flacco, I want to take a few calls here, but in closing before we do this, I mean, how long until we find out what the truth is?
[00:51:47.695 --> 00:51:51.296]  Well, I was asking that myself, and if there's going to be any
[00:51:52.182 --> 00:51:56.024]  Things you know bombs drop literally figuratively or whatever.
[00:51:56.024 --> 00:52:06.629]  I've heard that the grand jury expires that at least the current one that's up there one of the terms of one of them expires around October the 28th sometime in October.
[00:52:07.233 --> 00:52:16.017]  But then again, you see, if this business is true about other grand juries, if there are others, you know, they all have staggered terms, I would think.
[00:52:16.017 --> 00:52:19.199]  They're not going to have them all because they need them at different times, you know.
[00:52:19.199 --> 00:52:22.280]  One group does one subject, one group does another subject, you know.
[00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:26.282]  But I've heard sometime in mid to late October this thing runs out.
[00:52:26.282 --> 00:52:30.544]  So we're talking now, it's pushing into September, so you've got maybe about 30 to
[00:52:31.454 --> 00:52:35.277]  Forty-five days left, and I think they're going to be finishing up.
[00:52:35.277 --> 00:52:40.541]  But again, you go to congressmen and senators and they won't touch it, but then why would a U.S.
[00:52:40.541 --> 00:52:43.124]  attorney do all this?
[00:52:43.124 --> 00:52:44.985]  Because he's doing his job.
[00:52:44.985 --> 00:52:52.952]  His job is to subpoena, investigate, and prosecute criminal acts.
[00:52:52.952 --> 00:52:58.516]  Sometimes criminal acts involve individuals at a very high level of government.
[00:52:58.516 --> 00:52:59.397]  Not very often.
[00:52:59.986 --> 00:53:15.913]  And also, and here's another little key, remember about the document, Time reporter Matt Cooper said that when he, he said in his report, I remember reading this, he said that when I went to the grand jury to testify, I was impressed by the jurors.
[00:53:15.913 --> 00:53:24.817]  He said that I was in there for two and a half hours and the majority of the time, the majority of the time I spent answering questions from the jurors.
[00:53:25.299 --> 00:53:30.643]  He said that they were mostly women, and they were mostly African-American women.
[00:53:30.643 --> 00:53:32.964]  So you've talked to people that were even in there?
[00:53:32.964 --> 00:53:33.825]  No, I have not.
[00:53:33.825 --> 00:53:37.888]  I just read what Matthew Cooper, Time reporter, reported.
[00:53:37.888 --> 00:53:46.514]  He said, when he was there in front of the Grand Jury, that the... And that's the Grand Jury investigating Valerie Plain?
[00:53:46.514 --> 00:53:50.357]  It had to be, because that's what that was... Let's take one call from Melissa in Florida.
[00:53:50.357 --> 00:53:51.057]  Melissa, go ahead.
[00:53:55.746 --> 00:53:57.067]  Hi, thank you so much, Alex.
[00:53:57.067 --> 00:54:02.311]  I really appreciate you taking my call, and I appreciate you opening my eyes to the, you know, a new world order and everything.
[00:54:02.311 --> 00:54:10.556]  I mean, I'm 21 years old, and I'm just coming across all this stuff for the past eight months, and I don't think I've left now since I've opened the first webpage.
[00:54:10.556 --> 00:54:21.103]  What I'm calling about, and one, I've been listening, and I just think it's ridiculous that it really takes this much, like, digging for people to open their eyes to the 9-11 situation.
[00:54:21.103 --> 00:54:24.666]  It's unreal that they can't see what's going on.
[00:54:25.592 --> 00:54:32.318]  It just makes me really sad, and I hope everybody listening is, you know, trying to help their friends open their eyes, because I know I do every day.
[00:54:32.318 --> 00:54:34.840]  I try to get everybody in my family involved.
[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:38.003]  But, um, a lot of really interesting things I needed to ask you about.
[00:54:38.003 --> 00:54:44.308]  I've read lately that they're putting fluoride in the water system in my county, which is really weird to me.
[00:54:44.949 --> 00:54:49.411]  They're like adding it, and everybody's all excited about it, and I don't get it, and I don't like it.
[00:54:49.411 --> 00:54:55.974]  Well, I mean, you can get the letter that hundreds of EPA scientists just sent to the EPA saying it's deadly poison, remove it.
[00:54:55.974 --> 00:54:57.075]  I mean, it's unreal.
[00:54:57.075 --> 00:54:57.535]  It's unreal.
[00:54:57.535 --> 00:54:59.736]  These people are like, oh good, my children are going to have... You know what?
[00:54:59.736 --> 00:55:00.536]  I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
[00:55:00.536 --> 00:55:04.138]  I'm going to put you on hold, Melissa, and I'm going to finish up with you after the break.
[00:55:04.138 --> 00:55:05.739]  I'm going to say bye to Tom Floggo right now.
[00:55:05.739 --> 00:55:06.579]  He's got to go.
[00:55:06.579 --> 00:55:07.960]  TomFloggo.com.
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:11.782]  Tom, I appreciate you following up these reports, and I know you'll get to the bottom of it.
[00:55:12.262 --> 00:55:16.445]  And I appreciate your courage in, you know, on reporting on this to get to the bottom of it.
[00:55:16.445 --> 00:55:17.426]  So take care, my friend.
[00:55:17.426 --> 00:55:19.648]  Thank you for the job you're doing and for the opportunity.
[00:55:19.648 --> 00:55:20.629]  I appreciate it.
[00:55:20.629 --> 00:55:25.653]  I know it's been tiring for you, and we can look for some new reports from you in the next few days?
[00:55:25.653 --> 00:55:32.178]  Well, I don't know about a few days, but, you know, I'm always looking in for, you know, the next thing I'm working about, you know, that's for sure.
[00:55:32.178 --> 00:55:35.721]  But you're going to be staying on this case?
[00:55:35.721 --> 00:55:38.102]  Oh, yeah, we're working with this issue.
[00:55:38.102 --> 00:55:41.165]  Yeah, the issue surrounding the grand jury, I think, you know, whatever I
[00:55:42.504 --> 00:55:43.124]  Okay.
[00:55:43.124 --> 00:55:43.805]  Alright, thanks Don.
[00:55:43.805 --> 00:55:48.169]  Take care, bye.
[00:55:48.169 --> 00:55:51.292]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:55:51.292 --> 00:55:53.214]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:55:53.214 --> 00:55:58.218]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:55:58.218 --> 00:56:02.623]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:56:03.063 --> 00:56:07.464]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:56:07.464 --> 00:56:10.385]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:56:10.385 --> 00:56:15.267]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:56:15.267 --> 00:56:19.908]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:56:19.908 --> 00:56:27.371]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[00:57:59.201 --> 00:58:07.266]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:58:07.266 --> 00:58:14.291]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:58:14.511 --> 00:58:15.873]  There are no side effects.

[00:58:34.797 --> 00:58:35.878]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:58:35.878 --> 00:58:39.120]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:41.241]  Folks, there's a lot of this going on right now.
[00:58:59.406 --> 00:59:04.269]  You know, I almost always stick to what I can prove.
[00:59:04.269 --> 00:59:08.491]  Hey, they were having a drill at the exact same time at the exact same locations.
[00:59:08.491 --> 00:59:11.272]  It's impossible on the 7-7 bombings.
[00:59:11.272 --> 00:59:14.174]  This is a cover story for the government op.
[00:59:14.174 --> 00:59:26.180]  And then lo and behold, the reporters and the witnesses and the police say there were bombs under the trains and holes blown up through it, but they won't let you take photos and some press that got photos had their cameras taken.
[00:59:28.756 --> 00:59:37.624]  And then it comes out that the supposed mass bomber in control of the two squads, you know, it turns out he's MI6 protected in the U.S.
[00:59:37.624 --> 00:59:40.747]  in 99, protected there right now.
[00:59:40.747 --> 00:59:47.212]  Even Fox News has to admit, we don't know why the British are protecting this individual.
[00:59:47.212 --> 00:59:50.655]  And that's because it had already come out in the press.
[00:59:50.655 --> 00:59:52.417]  They had to report on it and explain it away.
[00:59:55.066 --> 01:00:08.978]  And, you know, if we can prove, you know, the preponderance of the evidence points towards government inside job, just on the evidence, then you've got the motive, which is on the government side, that is the criminal elements of the government.
[01:00:08.978 --> 01:00:17.445]  With something like 9-11, I mean, it's an ocean of evidence, an ocean of endless, an orgy of evidence, a total New World Order operation.
[01:00:18.675 --> 01:00:21.578]  I mean, it takes three films and two books to cover all the evidence.
[01:00:21.578 --> 01:00:32.947]  You know, I've made three films on the subject, written a book, published a book, carry a bunch of other great videos on the subject at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:00:32.947 --> 01:00:34.288]  You know, we're there exposing it.
[01:00:34.288 --> 01:00:36.890]  And we're going to continue to.
[01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:40.073]  But when you get into stuff like this Brigadier General
[01:00:41.849 --> 01:00:59.452]  Commanding General, number four in the Army, Kevin P. Burns, and I get a call about him a month ago, or three weeks ago, a month ago I get a call about there's going to be a drill, and it's going to be going on on the east coast of this town, and you've got to watch it really closely.
[01:00:59.452 --> 01:01:03.453]  This is from a good source.
[01:01:03.453 --> 01:01:04.293]  I didn't talk about it.
[01:01:04.293 --> 01:01:06.513]  I was like, well, I don't know what to say about that.
[01:01:06.513 --> 01:01:09.354]  I mean, I mentioned the drill, and I said, we've been told to watch this, but
[01:01:10.046 --> 01:01:13.548]  I didn't put two and two together that I'd already been warned by somebody else.
[01:01:13.548 --> 01:01:18.150]  Watch this General Kevin P. Burns.
[01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:21.751]  And then the story with Kevin P. Burns doesn't fit.
[01:01:21.751 --> 01:01:24.632]  He's going to retire in a couple of months.
[01:01:24.632 --> 01:01:27.794]  He's been in a divorce for six months.
[01:01:27.794 --> 01:01:30.775]  His lawyer puts out a letter when he gets canned unceremoniously.
[01:01:30.775 --> 01:01:37.738]  Well, okay, he was canned for an extramarital thing, but he's in a divorce and the woman's not in the military.
[01:01:38.419 --> 01:01:40.940]  Well, folks, they'd turn a blind eye to that.
[01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:44.581]  I mean, they'd turn a blind eye to four-star generals having mistresses.
[01:01:44.581 --> 01:01:47.802]  They'd turn a blind eye to them doing basically whatever they want, folks.
[01:01:47.802 --> 01:01:55.064]  I mean, a senior four-star general, out of eleven four-star generals in the Army, he was number three.
[01:01:55.064 --> 01:01:58.445]  And above that, there's the Army's seat on the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[01:01:58.445 --> 01:02:02.847]  I mean, so, as the echelon of power goes, that's about as high as it gets.
[01:02:02.847 --> 01:02:07.108]  You know, his boss, Shoemaker, just above him.
[01:02:07.108 --> 01:02:07.288]  So,
[01:02:08.587 --> 01:02:09.648]  That doesn't fit!
[01:02:09.648 --> 01:02:13.371]  And just suddenly, you're gone!
[01:02:13.371 --> 01:02:15.032]  You're gone!
[01:02:15.032 --> 01:02:20.236]  And then I, you know, we have Greg Zemensky who does a lot of good reports.
[01:02:20.236 --> 01:02:22.358]  Uh, you know, pretty accurate.
[01:02:22.358 --> 01:02:27.342]  Uh, coming out and, uh, you know, the body of his work is good.
[01:02:27.342 --> 01:02:29.824]  I mean, it's good information.
[01:02:29.824 --> 01:02:35.869]  He comes out and says his sources in the Pentagon are saying that, um, that this guy was planning some type of coup.
[01:02:36.559 --> 01:02:41.143]  Well, then my sources say, no, it was to leak information to burn the administration.
[01:02:41.143 --> 01:02:43.425]  Well, we've had a bunch of generals do that.
[01:02:43.425 --> 01:02:45.847]  We've had a bunch of former generals do that.
[01:02:45.847 --> 01:02:47.748]  We've had people inside.
[01:02:47.748 --> 01:02:49.289]  We've had ambassadors do that.
[01:02:49.289 --> 01:02:55.574]  We've had a bunch of people go public, so that fits the M.O.
[01:02:55.574 --> 01:02:57.716]  And what would spur him to do that?
[01:02:57.716 --> 01:03:00.518]  Was he learning of some new operation?
[01:03:00.518 --> 01:03:02.540]  Or had he learned of a previous operation?
[01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:06.043]  And then we get speculation that, well,
[01:03:06.946 --> 01:03:09.688]  Was, you know, was this nuke drill going to go live?
[01:03:09.688 --> 01:03:17.434]  The nuke drill that's going on right now that I've been warned about.
[01:03:17.434 --> 01:03:35.989]  So we have all of this swirling around and that type of story is the same type of story that we have, you know, with Tom Flacco and this grand jury up there that they reported is investigating the plane incident, which that would be criminal.
[01:03:37.110 --> 01:03:40.912]  Uh, blowing, you know, burning her, blowing her cover.
[01:03:40.912 --> 01:03:43.334]  That's, that much I know is admitted.
[01:03:43.334 --> 01:03:47.396]  And then it's an evil stretch to ask if there's an indictment.
[01:03:47.396 --> 01:03:49.137]  I mean, there may not be indictments.
[01:03:49.137 --> 01:03:51.719]  Tom may have been fed this info.
[01:03:51.719 --> 01:03:54.600]  The question is, why would they do that?
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:57.562]  But we have to talk about it a little bit.
[01:03:57.562 --> 01:03:59.203]  I mean, when I first heard about this last week,
[01:04:00.101 --> 01:04:05.365]  I actually heard about it before that from other sources, but then I kind of ignored it.
[01:04:05.365 --> 01:04:18.716]  Tom put an article out, it got really big, one of the biggest stories on the web, and I called Tom last Thursday, he couldn't come on, and then he called today and said I'll come on, so we had Tom on.
[01:04:18.716 --> 01:04:20.517]  So I don't know if it's true.
[01:04:20.517 --> 01:04:22.078]  I think Tom's a good guy.
[01:04:22.078 --> 01:04:25.301]  But I think he's definitely got some sources.
[01:04:25.301 --> 01:04:28.343]  But I don't know if those sources are good.
[01:04:29.855 --> 01:04:34.038]  I mean, I'm sure they're wonderful people, too.
[01:04:34.038 --> 01:04:37.721]  Frankly, I'm not a big fan of Stu Webb, I'll be honest with you.
[01:04:37.721 --> 01:04:41.804]  But, you know, Tom says his documents check out.
[01:04:41.804 --> 01:04:48.188]  But this is what Cloak & Dagger does.
[01:04:48.188 --> 01:04:50.330]  This is the fog they want where you don't know.
[01:04:50.330 --> 01:04:57.335]  I mean, look, I'm not the one saying we're going to get hit by an A-bomb, or a hydrogen bomb, or a dirty bomb.
[01:04:58.394 --> 01:05:01.555]  I mean, Dick Cheney says it over and over again.
[01:05:01.555 --> 01:05:03.276]  Chertoff's running around saying it.
[01:05:03.276 --> 01:05:05.717]  The Nightly News has special reports on it.
[01:05:05.717 --> 01:05:07.218]  Bin Laden's Nagasaki.
[01:05:07.218 --> 01:05:08.779]  Bin Laden's Revenge.
[01:05:08.779 --> 01:05:11.720]  I mean, I've got a huge section on the website of mainstream news articles.
[01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:13.480]  I mean, they tell U.S.
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:19.363]  News & World Report before the election, two months before, we will be hit by a nuclear weapon!
[01:05:19.363 --> 01:05:22.985]  The White House, the senior advisor in the White House, i.e.
[01:05:22.985 --> 01:05:24.966]  Karl Rove, told U.S.
[01:05:24.966 --> 01:05:28.668]  News & World Report, we are going to be nuked by the election.
[01:05:28.668 --> 01:05:30.809]  Well, I got on there and said, I don't believe that's going to happen.
[01:05:30.809 --> 01:05:33.530]  I think it'll happen in the next year if it does.
[01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:36.732]  But, there's no, oh, look at the government!
[01:05:36.732 --> 01:05:37.832]  They're totally uncredible!
[01:05:37.832 --> 01:05:38.813]  They're fear-mongering!
[01:05:39.423 --> 01:05:42.485]  No, they're saying there's going to be a nuclear attack.
[01:05:42.485 --> 01:05:48.748]  Look, we just take it serious when the President, the Vice President's minions, and the Vice President are running around saying it.
[01:05:48.748 --> 01:05:55.212]  So, we have to pay attention when then it comes out that, you know, are they going to have an exercise go live?
[01:05:55.212 --> 01:06:02.115]  Or, watch this General, and then he gets fired, and then he's over the base, where we hear they're going to have this test.
[01:06:02.115 --> 01:06:05.957]  Well, where they admit they're having a drill, but, you know, is it?
[01:06:05.957 --> 01:06:08.799]  So, welcome to my brain.
[01:06:13.166 --> 01:06:16.708]  And in the final equation, it just creates hysteria.
[01:06:16.708 --> 01:06:18.568]  It creates anxiety.
[01:06:18.568 --> 01:06:20.389]  It creates fear.
[01:06:20.389 --> 01:06:23.570]  It creates apprehension.
[01:06:23.570 --> 01:06:26.111]  We don't know what's true.
[01:06:26.111 --> 01:06:29.432]  We don't know what to say.
[01:06:29.432 --> 01:06:34.054]  You want us to report on it, and you say, well, why aren't you reporting on it?
[01:06:34.054 --> 01:06:37.015]  So I call my webmaster up, and I say, post the
[01:06:38.337 --> 01:06:41.199]  The Flacco story, and the responses to it.
[01:06:41.199 --> 01:06:42.160]  Well, is it real?
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.020]  Well, I don't know.
[01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:46.422]  Flacco seems like a good guy.
[01:06:46.422 --> 01:06:51.846]  We know there's a grand jury and panel investigating the leak.
[01:06:51.846 --> 01:06:52.646]  We don't know.
[01:06:52.646 --> 01:06:56.729]  We'll say we don't know, and you decide.
[01:06:56.729 --> 01:07:00.852]  Because, I mean, I deal in numbers.
[01:07:00.852 --> 01:07:07.016]  I mean, there are rocket attacks, there are hundreds of deaths, there are car bombs going off in Texas, and no one even knows about that.
[01:07:08.417 --> 01:07:09.177]  Okay.
[01:07:09.177 --> 01:07:20.620]  I mean, I got a CBS and AP at Brownsville, Dallas Morning News, but still, no one I talk to knows about it, because it's all piecemeal and reported very dryly.
[01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:23.921]  So, you know, if that can be going on, you know, are there indictments?
[01:07:23.921 --> 01:07:25.782]  I don't know.
[01:07:25.782 --> 01:07:33.884]  But I deal with, you know, on page 31 of the Free Trade Area of the Americas Agreement, you know, it says,
[01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:40.512]  Pan-American Union and merging our laws with that of the Pan-American Union and the EU.
[01:07:40.512 --> 01:07:41.953]  I mean, that's global government.
[01:07:41.953 --> 01:07:46.475]  I know the CFR put out a report calling for the end of America.
[01:07:46.475 --> 01:07:48.676]  I know Lou Dobbs decried it.
[01:07:48.676 --> 01:07:50.397]  I mean, he had the same analysis I did.
[01:07:50.397 --> 01:07:52.457]  It sounds crazy, but it's happening.
[01:07:52.457 --> 01:07:56.199]  I know they passed a law for forced psychological testing and forced drugging.
[01:07:56.199 --> 01:07:58.140]  Now they're trying to implement.
[01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:00.781]  I know that Bush called for total amnesty.
[01:08:00.781 --> 01:08:01.701]  And then said he didn't.
[01:08:01.701 --> 01:08:03.302]  Said that amnesty wasn't amnesty.
[01:08:04.388 --> 01:08:12.433]  I know that Rumsfeld really got up and said, I never said they had WMDs when he said it hundreds of times.
[01:08:12.433 --> 01:08:20.017]  So now we live in this world where the reason everything is so over the top is they're over the top.
[01:08:20.017 --> 01:08:24.060]  I mean the globalists are just out of control right now.
[01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:24.800]  But I don't know.
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:28.142]  I think I'm just going to predominantly focus on what I can document.
[01:08:29.187 --> 01:08:40.293]  Because it seems like the things that can't be documented are the things that people want to hear and things that people want to go crazy over.
[01:08:40.293 --> 01:08:41.894]  So, I don't know.
[01:08:41.894 --> 01:08:46.037]  If something can't be proven one way or the other, don't expect me to talk about it.
[01:08:46.037 --> 01:08:49.399]  That's always been my rule and it becomes a phenomenon.
[01:08:49.399 --> 01:08:50.439]  I've got to talk about it.
[01:08:50.439 --> 01:08:52.861]  It's like I've got to talk about these latest fear-mongering reports.
[01:08:52.861 --> 01:08:56.223]  Officials warn that Bin Laden is going to attack us around 9-11.
[01:08:57.392 --> 01:08:58.633]  That's the New York Times.
[01:08:58.633 --> 01:09:00.774]  More rumors, more fear-mongering.
[01:09:00.774 --> 01:09:05.857]  What Tom Flacco is saying is a hundred times more credible with more evidence than what they're saying.
[01:09:05.857 --> 01:09:09.720]  Just because the CIA says that their asset's going to do something.
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:18.025]  So, you know, when the administration constantly lives in wah-wah land, this stuff's going to happen.
[01:09:18.025 --> 01:09:23.569]  Let's go to Malta and then Mark, then Jeff, Mark, and Christie and others.
[01:09:23.569 --> 01:09:24.189]  Go ahead, Malta.
[01:09:28.743 --> 01:09:29.283]  He's gone.
[01:09:29.283 --> 01:09:30.464]  Let's go to the next person.
[01:09:30.464 --> 01:09:31.804]  Let's talk to Jeff and Mass.
[01:09:31.804 --> 01:09:32.644]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[01:09:32.644 --> 01:09:34.185]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[01:09:34.185 --> 01:09:34.625]  Yes.
[01:09:34.625 --> 01:09:45.949]  Now, as far as September the 11th is concerned, my big concern is if we have another September the 11th, what do you think would happen to America if we had a September the 11th?
[01:09:45.949 --> 01:09:49.290]  Do you think we would be completely doomed?
[01:09:49.290 --> 01:09:54.112]  The government is going to announce itself as absolute God, in the name of keeping us safe,
[01:09:55.309 --> 01:10:00.151]  And they're going to even get more criminal, which is why the government won't carry out an attack.
[01:10:00.151 --> 01:10:02.291]  They don't want total control and power.
[01:10:02.291 --> 01:10:04.292]  They're not behind any of it.
[01:10:04.292 --> 01:10:06.292]  Let's just give all our rights up to them.
[01:10:06.292 --> 01:10:12.374]  But if they know we're not going to put up with it, and we just say no, then they may not even carry out more attacks.
[01:10:12.374 --> 01:10:17.876]  Yeah, that's true, because I'll tell you what, as a cynic, I would give them the hairy eyeball if they pulled something, that's for sure.
[01:10:17.876 --> 01:10:21.817]  For those who don't know, what's the hairy eyeball mean?
[01:10:23.247 --> 01:10:27.209]  It means, you know, put them under investigation.
[01:10:27.209 --> 01:10:29.351]  In other words, investigate it.
[01:10:29.351 --> 01:10:31.012]  Do research on it.
[01:10:31.012 --> 01:10:34.214]  Well, I think the 7-7... I don't think I know.
[01:10:34.214 --> 01:10:39.558]  The 7-7 attacks were a trial balloon to see if we would cower in fear.
[01:10:39.558 --> 01:10:43.621]  And people unanimously, basically, are saying the government did it.
[01:10:43.621 --> 01:10:44.642]  That's good news for us.
[01:10:44.642 --> 01:10:45.182]  We'll be right back.
[01:10:47.259 --> 01:10:50.880]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:51.540]  Why?
[01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:54.241]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?

[01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:53.533]  These chemicals are affecting our brains and may well destroy our society.
[01:13:53.533 --> 01:13:54.013]  Shocking?
[01:13:54.013 --> 01:13:54.734]  Of course!

[01:14:58.069 --> 01:15:01.371]  Oh, just shifting gears back to what Melissa in Florida had asked about.
[01:15:01.371 --> 01:15:07.614]  They're putting fluoride in their local water supply, and she was saying, why are people so excited about it?
[01:15:07.614 --> 01:15:09.114]  Because the media tells them it's good.
[01:15:09.114 --> 01:15:14.837]  But actually, in polls, most Americans know that sodium and stannous fluoride is very bad for them.
[01:15:14.837 --> 01:15:22.801]  And even the big dentist, 15 years ago, who was responsible for getting the water fluoridated in Canada, has now gone public and said he was wrong.
[01:15:22.801 --> 01:15:24.142]  He was a big government official, too.
[01:15:24.893 --> 01:15:36.881]  And so he didn't know they were taking stannous fluoride or fluoride that's left over from aluminum plants and fertilizer plants full of other toxins and metals and dumping that in the water.
[01:15:36.881 --> 01:15:44.285]  There's a big difference between your body needing a little bit of sodium fluoride and the other, you know, many many different types of fluoride.
[01:15:44.285 --> 01:15:47.147]  I mean, it's a deadly poison.
[01:15:47.147 --> 01:15:49.168]  I mean, it's ridiculous, folks.
[01:15:49.168 --> 01:15:50.809]  It's so bad for you.
[01:15:50.809 --> 01:15:51.990]  And they put it in toothpaste,
[01:15:52.768 --> 01:15:54.229]  They put it in a bunch of other studies.
[01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:56.010]  It's horrible!
[01:15:56.010 --> 01:15:58.152]  It's just... But they tell you it's good.
[01:15:58.152 --> 01:16:00.974]  It's part of this mass hoax.
[01:16:00.974 --> 01:16:02.495]  And people use it.
[01:16:02.495 --> 01:16:09.941]  They just had literally hundreds of scientists and top EPA employees sign an open letter to the head of the EPA saying, get it out.
[01:16:09.941 --> 01:16:11.302]  Look at all these studies.
[01:16:11.302 --> 01:16:13.484]  Nobel Prize winners, folks.
[01:16:13.484 --> 01:16:17.186]  The top scientists are saying how deadly it is.
[01:16:17.186 --> 01:16:19.108]  It's deadly poison, people!
[01:16:22.157 --> 01:16:26.239]  I mean, one drop will kill you!
[01:16:26.239 --> 01:16:32.043]  Let's go ahead and uh... They're like pickling your brains, folks.
[01:16:32.043 --> 01:16:35.965]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in Louisiana.
[01:16:35.965 --> 01:16:37.766]  Mark, go ahead.
[01:16:37.766 --> 01:16:38.406]  Hello?
[01:16:38.406 --> 01:16:39.066]  Yes, Mark.
[01:16:39.066 --> 01:16:41.428]  That's Las Vegas.
[01:16:41.428 --> 01:16:41.988]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:16:41.988 --> 01:16:42.688]  You're on the air.
[01:16:42.688 --> 01:16:45.270]  Yeah, that's Las Vegas, not Louisiana.
[01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:46.050]  Say it again.
[01:16:46.050 --> 01:16:47.031]  Las Vegas.
[01:16:47.031 --> 01:16:47.411]  Say it again.
[01:16:48.237 --> 01:16:50.598]  I'm just, I'm having a joke with you.
[01:16:50.598 --> 01:16:52.098]  Alright, yeah, I figured that out.
[01:16:52.098 --> 01:17:09.702]  Alright, I noticed Bush, a couple days ago, he made a little stop in Chicago and I was going to ask Tom Flacco, who's on it, when I called, if there might have been a nexus between that and the proceedings going on there.
[01:17:09.702 --> 01:17:16.244]  Kind of interesting too, he stopped in Chicago and I guess he was hanging out with his new
[01:17:17.011 --> 01:17:31.004]  We're not new, but I'm sure he's known him for quite some time, but his little buddy, his crime and partner, Mayor Richard Daley, I think what a good man Richard Daley is, and who I guess is also sort of involved in one of Patrick Fitzgerald's
[01:17:32.395 --> 01:17:41.418]  other investigations uh... daily or by the way that's admitted that's an MSNBC that daily is being investigated by this by this U.S.
[01:17:41.418 --> 01:18:01.646]  attorney for organized crime now that that's a key point yeah now Bush yeah he when he stopped in Chicago he was giving a bunch of accolades to Daily and think how wonderful it is that Chicago is going to be getting you know like uh... you know hundreds of millions of dollars for their transit system but uh... I thought that was kind of interesting also this story about uh...
[01:18:02.128 --> 01:18:07.690]  There's illegal aliens that are working for the Border Patrol and then smuggling in other illegal aliens?
[01:18:07.690 --> 01:18:11.331]  Well, I mean, the head of the Border Patrol is a Laurie Conquista.
[01:18:11.331 --> 01:18:14.152]  I mean, the Attorney General is a Laurie Conquista.
[01:18:14.152 --> 01:18:30.778]  I was going to point out that there has got to be, and of course they were charging like two grand per person they were smuggling in, there's got to be some politicians involved in this operation because when I got out of the Marine Corps, I had applied
[01:18:31.283 --> 01:18:42.869]  to work for the Border Patrol and in order to even take the test for the Border Patrol, they actually told me that I need like a congressman or a senator to recommend me.
[01:18:42.869 --> 01:18:43.529]  I mean, that's how
[01:18:44.631 --> 01:18:47.693]  That's how, you know, impossible it was to organize.
[01:18:47.693 --> 01:18:50.896]  Well, that's illegal, but that's like mafia big city.
[01:18:50.896 --> 01:18:53.519]  Talk about daily machine.
[01:18:53.519 --> 01:18:56.261]  You don't get a job unless El Jefe says you get one.
[01:18:56.261 --> 01:19:00.265]  Yeah, so I mean, there's no way this was an accident, but of course they're going to make it so.
[01:19:00.265 --> 01:19:07.772]  Well, for those that don't know, we had the head of the Border Patrol Union on, okay, saying that they're infiltrating, they're taking over.
[01:19:08.627 --> 01:19:13.011]  And it's been in mainstream news that they've ordered the Border Patrol to stand down.
[01:19:13.011 --> 01:19:16.734]  They have X-ing where they're not allowed to stop illegal aliens in certain areas.
[01:19:16.734 --> 01:19:19.736]  But then they're going to have a checkpoint searching you and your family.
[01:19:19.736 --> 01:19:23.739]  And again, for all these low-income cases that think they're taking over, why is the U.S.
[01:19:23.739 --> 01:19:24.740]  government behind it?
[01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:26.902]  They want to break America down too.
[01:19:26.902 --> 01:19:29.444]  And you know, I haven't talked enough about that.
[01:19:29.444 --> 01:19:35.629]  It came out in UPI and the Washington Times as well as the Associated Press on Monday.
[01:19:35.629 --> 01:19:38.091]  And I just barely mentioned it because it's part of the course.
[01:19:38.832 --> 01:19:45.046]  That senior Border Patrol agents on the border are actually Mexican citizens.
[01:19:47.769 --> 01:19:49.770]  Yeah, forgot that part.
[01:19:49.770 --> 01:19:53.891]  Mexican citizens, Mark, and that they're coyotes.
[01:19:53.891 --> 01:19:59.933]  Well, I mean, we've had mayors and people and all over the country being caught being coyotes and nothing happens to them.
[01:19:59.933 --> 01:20:01.593]  This is big business.
[01:20:01.593 --> 01:20:04.754]  They're sucking off these poor immigrants who are good, hard-working people.
[01:20:04.754 --> 01:20:05.994]  I'm not against them, folks.
[01:20:05.994 --> 01:20:09.455]  But the point is, it's destroying our country.
[01:20:09.455 --> 01:20:11.996]  By virtue of the capacity they work in, they're able to
[01:20:12.556 --> 01:20:13.697]  I've been going across the border.
[01:20:13.697 --> 01:20:18.081]  If you're a Mexican with a cowboy hat, you don't get searched.
[01:20:18.081 --> 01:20:19.902]  If you're a white guy or a black guy, just get ready.
[01:20:19.902 --> 01:20:21.323]  It's all part of freedom.
[01:20:21.323 --> 01:20:22.084]  We'll be right back folks.
[01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:40.609]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:20:40.609 --> 01:20:44.199]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:47.515 --> 01:20:49.255]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:20:49.255 --> 01:20:53.496]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:20:53.496 --> 01:20:56.457]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:20:56.457 --> 01:21:03.359]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:21:03.359 --> 01:21:06.559]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:21:06.559 --> 01:21:09.080]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:13.801]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[01:21:14.121 --> 01:21:14.621]  We're good to go!
[01:21:38.353 --> 01:21:38.794]  803-4438.
[01:21:38.794 --> 01:21:39.234]  That's 888-803-4438.

[01:22:18.544 --> 01:22:19.805]  Tired of guessing what they are?
[01:22:19.805 --> 01:22:20.626]  Which are collectible?

[01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:26.651]  Coins.

[01:22:47.553 --> 01:22:50.176]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:22:50.176 --> 01:22:54.340]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:55.581]  Read the labels.
[01:22:55.581 --> 01:22:59.925]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:22:59.925 --> 01:23:04.489]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:23:04.489 --> 01:23:09.374]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:23:09.734 --> 01:23:13.516]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:23:13.516 --> 01:23:19.119]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:23:19.119 --> 01:23:22.140]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.

[01:23:37.868 --> 01:23:40.249]  We've got about 26 and a half minutes left.
[01:23:40.249 --> 01:23:45.471]  We're going to continue with your calls and some other important news.
[01:24:03.719 --> 01:24:11.125]  I haven't seen the crime statistics in a couple of years, but they're generally about the same.
[01:24:11.125 --> 01:24:19.152]  But over 90%, some years as high as 95% of crimes go unsolved.
[01:24:19.152 --> 01:24:23.676]  I mean, I've had cars stolen twice, apartments broken into before.
[01:24:25.388 --> 01:24:31.113]  And, uh, cars broken into actually quite a bit, uh, where I'd call the police.
[01:24:31.113 --> 01:24:36.358]  And the cops would show up and go, hey, you're in a private apartment complex, but like, there's no gate?
[01:24:36.358 --> 01:24:37.519]  Aren't you gonna do a report?
[01:24:37.519 --> 01:24:37.879]  No?
[01:24:37.879 --> 01:24:43.104]  But they sure got time to pull me over, buddy.
[01:24:43.104 --> 01:24:44.365]  Oh, yeah.
[01:24:44.365 --> 01:24:47.107]  It's just about raising money.
[01:24:47.107 --> 01:24:47.928]  And that's the system.
[01:24:47.928 --> 01:24:49.289]  We gotta change that.
[01:24:49.289 --> 01:24:52.192]  You're like, Alex, what does this have to do with the price of tea in China?
[01:24:54.540 --> 01:25:02.584]  The point I'm getting at is, is that if you kill a cop, it's over a 90% apprehension and conviction.
[01:25:02.584 --> 01:25:04.045]  Over 90%.
[01:25:04.045 --> 01:25:12.829]  So in 90 plus percent of the time, we don't get justice, but in 90 plus percent of the time, they get justice.
[01:25:12.829 --> 01:25:14.810]  And that's wrong.
[01:25:14.810 --> 01:25:18.412]  Of course, a lot of times somebody kills a cop, they're going to find somebody to pay.
[01:25:19.449 --> 01:25:21.150]  And that's also been shown.
[01:25:21.150 --> 01:25:25.491]  Some of the worst miscarriages of justice are just fining somebody!
[01:25:25.491 --> 01:25:30.212]  And now, if you kick a police dog, you get more time in jail than murdering a human being.
[01:25:30.212 --> 01:25:31.952]  And I've got a bunch of news reports on that.
[01:25:31.952 --> 01:25:39.754]  People get 45 years for kicking a police dog, and the average is about, what, 7 years for homicide?
[01:25:39.754 --> 01:25:42.135]  Manslaughter, even less.
[01:25:42.135 --> 01:25:45.396]  But, just something for you to think about out there.
[01:25:45.396 --> 01:25:46.476]  But the reason I brought that up
[01:25:47.245 --> 01:25:59.312]  What got me thinking about just those statistics during the break was that, you know, good Border Patrol agents blew the whistle about these other agents that were Mexican citizens, and our government knew that.
[01:25:59.312 --> 01:26:02.054]  That's who they recruit.
[01:26:02.054 --> 01:26:03.815]  Not even Americans, folks.
[01:26:03.815 --> 01:26:07.577]  I mean, twenty-something percent of our military in Iraq's foreign.
[01:26:07.577 --> 01:26:10.279]  And this is the new enforcement arm of the new world order, folks.
[01:26:10.279 --> 01:26:11.960]  It's real simple.
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:14.181]  And they blew the whistle.
[01:26:14.181 --> 01:26:16.603]  Well, you know how many times they had to blow the whistle for that to happen?
[01:26:17.239 --> 01:26:22.760]  And they had to get that out in the press for something to happen and now nothing may even happen because the investigation has been widened.
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:30.221]  And they'll have an investigation for two or three years and then nobody ever gets in trouble.
[01:26:30.221 --> 01:26:34.902]  We've had fraud investigations here in the city where people are caught red-handed.
[01:26:34.902 --> 01:26:38.403]  It's admitted they stole.
[01:26:38.403 --> 01:26:41.784]  District Attorney says, I'm not going to do anything.
[01:26:41.784 --> 01:26:43.984]  County Attorney, I'm not doing nothing.
[01:26:45.572 --> 01:26:49.914]  So basically, they'll have an investigation, you know, you come to them, we'll get right on this.
[01:26:49.914 --> 01:26:51.495]  This is very serious.
[01:26:51.495 --> 01:26:54.156]  Why, there's an investigation.
[01:26:54.156 --> 01:27:11.724]  If you're a politician who's in favor, you'd basically have to cut a two-year-old child in front of a hundred news cameras, marinate them in a wine sauce, and cook them on a spit to maybe get in trouble.
[01:27:11.724 --> 01:27:14.886]  And when you've got corruption that bad,
[01:27:16.954 --> 01:27:22.335]  Now, if you're a politician that isn't playing ball in the New World Order, you cheat on your wife, it's going to be in the newspaper.
[01:27:22.335 --> 01:27:24.736]  Ian, you've got a tail.
[01:27:24.736 --> 01:27:26.836]  You're being followed.
[01:27:26.836 --> 01:27:28.157]  But, no, I mean, I'm serious.
[01:27:28.157 --> 01:27:30.217]  I think Bush could barb- I shouldn't juggle.
[01:27:30.217 --> 01:27:31.397]  He'll probably start doing it.
[01:27:31.397 --> 01:27:37.219]  He could probably barbecue small children on a spit on the White House lawn and it would be called Christian.
[01:27:37.219 --> 01:27:38.619]  Oh, it's of the Lord.
[01:27:38.619 --> 01:27:41.600]  I mean, it's almost that ridiculous.
[01:27:44.542 --> 01:27:46.163]  Let's move quickly through these calls.
[01:27:46.163 --> 01:27:58.307]  Let's go to Christina and then we'll go to Mike and many, many others that are patiently holding.
[01:27:58.307 --> 01:27:59.547]  Christina, you're on the air.
[01:27:59.547 --> 01:28:00.507]  Welcome.
[01:28:00.507 --> 01:28:03.489]  Greetings from KCXL land, Alex.
[01:28:03.489 --> 01:28:04.109]  That's right.
[01:28:04.109 --> 01:28:06.550]  One of our oldest and best affiliates.
[01:28:06.550 --> 01:28:07.290]  That's right.
[01:28:07.290 --> 01:28:08.350]  Kansas City.
[01:28:08.350 --> 01:28:08.650]  Right.
[01:28:08.650 --> 01:28:10.311]  I've been listening to you for years.
[01:28:10.311 --> 01:28:13.552]  Listen, we read at our recent Concerned Citizens
[01:28:14.509 --> 01:28:34.576]  Tom Flacco's report especially we were interested and read the financing 9-11 attacks portion which talks a lot about Stewart Webb's documentation and I agree with you there's a war on for our mind we are not sure who's who or what's what some of the time.
[01:28:34.576 --> 01:28:41.798]  Stewart Webb has been to many of our meetings and we are unsure about him.
[01:28:42.699 --> 01:29:11.481]  Tells us that he's risked his life to bring a lot of these documentations and I do believe and haven't recently spoken with him that there is a grand jury and that these reports, because Tom Flacco and Sherman Skulnick and others are bringing this, I tend to agree with Stuart Webb on some of these things and so I just wanted to report that to you.
[01:29:12.296 --> 01:29:14.238]  It's very confusing.
[01:29:14.238 --> 01:29:16.219]  It's very confusing to me.
[01:29:16.219 --> 01:29:18.381]  That's what intelligence operations are supposed to do.
[01:29:18.381 --> 01:29:19.883]  They're supposed to confuse you.
[01:29:19.883 --> 01:29:27.889]  The old prayer they used to say in the British Navy when they were having war with people was, you know, may we see clearly and may they be confused.
[01:29:27.889 --> 01:29:28.250]  Amen.
[01:29:28.250 --> 01:29:32.033]  There's wisdom in the multitude of counselors is what the Bible says.
[01:29:32.816 --> 01:29:38.818]  And I've been speaking to many people, Wolfgang, Anna Conn, Clay Douglas and others.
[01:29:38.818 --> 01:29:40.739]  Ah, there's a... Well, different ones.
[01:29:40.739 --> 01:29:42.259]  True, true Jim.
[01:29:42.259 --> 01:29:46.500]  Alex, I don't know, I don't know.
[01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:48.861]  Anyway... I'm just laughing, I'm having a little fun here.
[01:29:48.861 --> 01:29:55.724]  The Concerned Citizens of the Heartland are a great group and they've been together for ten years and... Well, I'm sure your group is great.
[01:29:55.724 --> 01:29:57.024]  Anyway, we are...
[01:29:58.138 --> 01:30:03.603]  I just want to tell you, we are in a little bit of confusion also as to what is really going on.
[01:30:03.603 --> 01:30:05.004]  Well, you know what I'd encourage you to do?
[01:30:05.004 --> 01:30:11.869]  I would encourage you, what I'm going to do is focus on the masses of stuff we can prove.
[01:30:11.869 --> 01:30:21.637]  And whenever you're not sure about something, still keep an eye on it, but these soap opera type things are almost designed to get us all balled up in them.
[01:30:22.245 --> 01:30:24.246]  Which I'm beginning to get, you know, caught in.
[01:30:24.246 --> 01:30:32.709]  And, you know, while we should keep, you know, a spoon in the broth of this pot, we should also kind of keep some of the other stuff cooking.
[01:30:32.709 --> 01:30:35.670]  I mean, there's just so much out there, and I appreciate your call.
[01:30:35.670 --> 01:30:36.971]  Good to hear from you.
[01:30:36.971 --> 01:30:43.633]  Yeah, no, I mean, that's just, you know, when I said about that individual earlier, I just said I'm not too sure.
[01:30:43.633 --> 01:30:47.595]  That's all I can really put it lightly for you.
[01:30:47.595 --> 01:30:50.196]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Arizona.
[01:30:50.993 --> 01:30:51.954]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[01:30:51.954 --> 01:30:52.254]  Did I?
[01:30:52.254 --> 01:30:54.256]  Well, that was an interesting segment, to be sure.
[01:30:54.256 --> 01:30:54.636]  I probably did.
[01:30:54.636 --> 01:31:00.500]  I just wonder, have you been able to reach, or have you tried to reach General Burns?
[01:31:11.648 --> 01:31:13.750]  Yeah, his number's not listed.
[01:31:13.750 --> 01:31:17.133]  I've called three Kevin Peay Burnses and none of them are him.
[01:31:17.133 --> 01:31:22.838]  Yeah, because I suspect that if our suspicions are right, this man needs a lifeline thrown to him.
[01:31:22.838 --> 01:31:25.861]  He needs as much light on him as possible.
[01:31:25.861 --> 01:31:30.204]  What did you think about the Flacco interview?
[01:31:30.204 --> 01:31:35.829]  Like you, I think it's too soon to get too
[01:31:37.379 --> 01:31:45.406]  Yeah, we got people that are condemning it out of hand saying it's not true, and then people that are saying it's true.
[01:31:45.406 --> 01:31:46.807]  There is a criminal grand jury.
[01:31:46.807 --> 01:31:47.828]  It is being investigated.
[01:31:47.828 --> 01:31:51.952]  This same guy is investigating daily for quote organized crime.
[01:31:51.952 --> 01:31:53.974]  So there's something going on.
