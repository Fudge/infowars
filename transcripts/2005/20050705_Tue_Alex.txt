[00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:06.309]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.010]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.751 --> 00:00:09.851]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.491 --> 00:00:11.332]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.092 --> 00:00:12.953]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.653 --> 00:00:17.575]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:21.917]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:41.006]  Well, my friends, as we come off of this three-day weekend, I want to welcome you to the broadcast.
[00:00:41.026 --> 00:00:42.828]  The fifth day of July 2005.
[00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:47.831]  We'll be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:48.832 --> 00:00:56.637]  Coming up for part of the next hour, we'll be talking to Dr. Chris Green, who's been leading the fight against Codex Alimentarius, the global...
[00:00:57.675 --> 00:01:03.938]  Laws being put into place against supplements, vitamins, minerals, you name it.
[00:01:04.419 --> 00:01:09.061]  And how that ties in to the free trade area of the Americas and CAFTA.
[00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:28.794]  The Senate on Friday, while most people were preparing for the holiday weekend, and while most people were busy focusing on the announced resignation of one of the Supreme Court justices, they snuck this through the Senate, though it has not yet passed the House.
[00:01:31.776 --> 00:01:34.178]  Literally, it gets worse and worse, folks.
[00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.321]  I've never had a stack of news this thick
[00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.912]  I've never had this much information to cover.
[00:01:42.572 --> 00:01:43.592]  It is daunting.
[00:01:44.013 --> 00:01:50.075]  I could spend the next three hours on just two or three of these subjects and issues, but we just don't have time to do it.
[00:01:50.496 --> 00:01:55.858]  We'll have to just shotgun effect, try to cover everything as quickly as possible.
[00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:06.183]  By the way, joining us in the third hour, Joe Bannister, the IRS agent, the Armed Treasury agent,
[00:02:06.727 --> 00:02:16.050]  We went public, what, five years ago concerning the private nature of the Internal Revenue Service and the private corporation that runs our government.
[00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.291]  He was charged with trying to help somebody basically evade their taxes.
[00:02:21.672 --> 00:02:24.492]  He was found not guilty by a jury of his peers.
[00:02:24.993 --> 00:02:26.033]  It is a big deal.
[00:02:26.693 --> 00:02:35.716]  And Joe Bannister will be joining us coming up in the third hour with two of his lawyers that put on the case.
[00:02:36.016 --> 00:02:36.196]  So
[00:02:37.802 --> 00:02:46.187]  We've got four guests today, three at the same time in the third hour, and I do want to have time to take a few of your calls and masses of news.
[00:02:47.228 --> 00:02:51.231]  Bush is saying, tone down attacks against Alberto Gonzalez.
[00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:52.972]  This is in the Associates.
[00:02:53.092 --> 00:02:54.913]  Oh, don't talk about his friend.
[00:02:54.933 --> 00:03:04.499]  How dare you conservatives come out against an anti-gun, pro-abortion, Mecha member who wants to open our borders up.
[00:03:05.797 --> 00:03:09.280]  And who says torture is good and Bush is above the law.
[00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:16.085]  How dare you come out and talk bad about him while he'll pick whoever he wants.
[00:03:16.105 --> 00:03:26.814]  So the pressure is massive by the mere fact that Lord Bush this morning had an announcement on Tuesday morning concerning this.
[00:03:26.874 --> 00:03:27.854]  So we'll go over that.
[00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:29.976]  We'll go over who Alberto Gonzalez is.
[00:03:30.817 --> 00:03:34.700]  And even if it isn't Gonzalez this go-around with Sandra Day O'Connor...
[00:03:36.497 --> 00:03:42.041]  Rehnquist is going to be leaving in the next six months, maybe even sooner, so look for Alberto.
[00:03:42.081 --> 00:03:53.469]  We have this from their favorite leaker, the syndicated columnist, from their favorite little leaker, from Robert Novak.
[00:03:54.378 --> 00:03:57.039]  And his article was written three days before the announcement.
[00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:58.879]  No, no, not Gonzalez.
[00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:02.660]  But, oh yes, yes, we know it's going to be Gonzalez.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.862]  Unless there's a big enough firestorm, and make no mistake, this has been a trial balloon.
[00:04:08.182 --> 00:04:11.483]  There's some good news on the private property front.
[00:04:11.603 --> 00:04:22.166]  A whole bunch of states, from Rhode Island to Texas, are moving to pass legislation blocking the takings of private property for private use.
[00:04:23.183 --> 00:04:24.844]  And I've got to spend some time on this.
[00:04:25.284 --> 00:04:27.525]  Veteran radio host Paul Harvey.
[00:04:28.386 --> 00:04:35.129]  One of my earliest memories are listening to Paul Harvey in the morning while my father drove the car.
[00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.431]  He came out, folks, a week ago and talked about this.
[00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:40.671]  I just heard it this weekend.
[00:04:40.691 --> 00:04:41.572]  We wrote an article about it.
[00:04:42.892 --> 00:04:43.513]  He came out.
[00:04:43.793 --> 00:04:45.094]  I'll tell you what he came out for.
[00:04:45.714 --> 00:04:48.155]  We even have the audio clip for documentary purposes.
[00:04:49.075 --> 00:04:50.176]  It's unbelievable.
[00:04:50.925 --> 00:04:52.447]  This is only the tip of the iceberg.
[00:04:52.687 --> 00:04:56.431]  Ultra-massive broadcast, if any broadcast fits that definition.
[00:04:56.731 --> 00:04:57.312]  This is it.
[00:04:57.332 --> 00:04:58.233]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:04:58.273 --> 00:04:58.653]  Get ready.
[00:05:01.476 --> 00:05:04.359]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:06.370]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:12.312]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:05:12.572 --> 00:05:17.833]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:05:18.134 --> 00:05:22.235]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:05:22.415 --> 00:05:26.239]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.125]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:05:31.225 --> 00:05:37.492]  Proofs on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.532 --> 00:05:39.354]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:05:39.834 --> 00:05:41.915]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.
[00:05:41.995 --> 00:05:45.356]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:45.676 --> 00:05:46.937]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:47.877 --> 00:05:53.539]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:55.640]  You see big brothers afraid of this documentary.
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.400]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.601]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:06:00.425 --> 00:06:03.688]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:06:03.748 --> 00:06:07.951]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:06:08.172 --> 00:06:10.974]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:06:11.154 --> 00:06:13.556]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:06:13.756 --> 00:06:21.803]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:06:21.983 --> 00:06:23.344]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:06:23.545 --> 00:06:27.688]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:06:27.748 --> 00:06:28.669]  Not yet available?
[00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:07.116]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[00:07:07.636 --> 00:07:13.061]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Nonex Nail Gel.
[00:07:13.461 --> 00:07:23.490]  All-natural Nonex is a topical, ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.052]  Nonex Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[00:07:26.332 --> 00:07:29.355]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[00:07:29.435 --> 00:07:31.016]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[00:07:31.136 --> 00:07:38.623]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[00:07:38.903 --> 00:07:40.604]  It's also money-back guarantee.
[00:07:40.965 --> 00:07:52.655]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Long's, Brooks, and independent pharmacies nationwide, or online at drugstore.com.
[00:07:53.215 --> 00:07:54.396]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:07:54.656 --> 00:07:57.597]  For clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[00:07:59.757 --> 00:08:04.799]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:07.500]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:15.103]  Alright, today is set to be a barn burner.
[00:08:16.063 --> 00:08:17.403]  Fifth day of July 2005.
[00:08:20.379 --> 00:08:37.505]  Last night, watching the fireworks burst over the city skyline of Austin, Texas, I basically in my mind symbolized our freedoms exploding and dissipating as each of the salvos exploded.
[00:08:38.526 --> 00:08:47.829]  And I just thought about how, to the average American, the Fourth of July is a time to eat cheeseburgers and hot dogs and drink copious amounts of alcohol.
[00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:52.431]  There is a total disconnect with what America is really all about.
[00:08:52.972 --> 00:08:54.872]  And that's been done by design.
[00:08:55.072 --> 00:08:56.813]  It has been drummed out of us.
[00:08:57.493 --> 00:09:01.395]  It has been systematically divorced from our consciousness.
[00:09:03.555 --> 00:09:16.480]  I've got masses of stories here out of the Associated Press, the Houston Chronicle, the London Telegraph, where the federal government is now having to admit that Ritalin is killing children, causing all sorts of medical problems.
[00:09:17.324 --> 00:09:30.433]  They're admitting that Prozac-type drugs also increase suicide in adults, not just children, validating the older studies and research and all the guests that we have discussed and covered here on this broadcast.
[00:09:31.774 --> 00:09:34.115]  We have this new Supreme Court vacancy.
[00:09:34.235 --> 00:09:41.000]  We have the Supreme Court ruling concerning takings of private property for private uses, total piracy.
[00:09:42.001 --> 00:09:47.184]  Total admiralty law feeding on us like pirates.
[00:09:48.624 --> 00:09:58.609]  We have an article here where a former governor of Minnesota, Jesse Ventura, comes out and says, yeah, the official 9-11 story is a fraud, and he goes over it in detail.
[00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:10.195]  We have Paul Harvey saying black slavery had to be done, that smallpox blankets to the Indians had to be done, that we should just start nuking Saudi Arabia.
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:31.053]  Folks, I literally could take three of these articles and spend the next three hours on it, but we've got a guest coming on to talk about the Codex Alimentarius, that if we go into the free trade area of the Americas, we'll be under that regulatory system over our vitamins, minerals, all supplements.
[00:10:32.974 --> 00:10:41.040]  We also have the IRS armed agent, Treasury agent, Joe Bannister coming on, who just won his big court case in the third hour with his lawyers.
[00:10:42.702 --> 00:10:47.764]  And I'm sure many of you are chomping at the bit to talk about all of these issues.
[00:10:50.305 --> 00:10:53.767]  And folks, literally, normally I've got about a six-inch stack.
[00:10:54.607 --> 00:11:04.091]  The stack I have, that I printed off, because for posterity I print each article, ladies and gentlemen, is over one foot tall.
[00:11:06.312 --> 00:11:07.133]  One foot.
[00:11:08.994 --> 00:11:12.095]  And myself and Paul Watson worked quite a bit this weekend.
[00:11:13.169 --> 00:11:18.451]  On posting articles, writing articles, I was unable to really take a break this weekend.
[00:11:18.491 --> 00:11:19.832]  Plus, my wife got food poisoning.
[00:11:19.852 --> 00:11:20.712]  She's getting better now.
[00:11:22.133 --> 00:11:24.094]  So I haven't really had a vacation, but it doesn't matter.
[00:11:24.174 --> 00:11:30.276]  I had three days to stew in my juices and to just research.
[00:11:31.257 --> 00:11:33.938]  And let me tell you, it is not a pretty picture.
[00:11:35.758 --> 00:11:39.240]  Okay, let's just take it from the top here.
[00:11:40.859 --> 00:11:44.602]  Bush came out this morning and said, tone down attacks against Gonzalez.
[00:11:46.363 --> 00:11:49.286]  And we wrote the detailed article Friday, Paul Watson and myself.
[00:11:49.346 --> 00:11:52.568]  Tortured architect Gonzalez could be Bush's Supreme Court pick.
[00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:53.669]  It was funny.
[00:11:53.729 --> 00:12:00.895]  Back on Thursday, Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America said, it looks like it's going to be Gonzalez, even before this was announced.
[00:12:01.701 --> 00:12:01.821]  And, um...
[00:12:29.275 --> 00:12:33.099]  Alberto Gonzalez is a great friend of mine, Bush told USA Today.
[00:12:33.679 --> 00:12:36.102]  When a friend gets attacked, I don't like it.
[00:12:37.003 --> 00:12:45.711]  The president appealed to special interest groups running ads and mobilizing supporters for an anticipated fight of the Supreme Court nominee to tone down the heated rhetoric.
[00:12:46.672 --> 00:12:48.654]  It's not rhetoric, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:49.944 --> 00:12:53.767]  Alberto Gonzalez is a radical pro-abortion advocate.
[00:12:54.348 --> 00:12:57.110]  He isn't just, okay, I'm for some abortion, which is bad enough.
[00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:00.833]  He's, yes, 12-year-olds shouldn't have to tell their parents when they get them.
[00:13:01.353 --> 00:13:03.175]  He is not just pro-gun control.
[00:13:03.215 --> 00:13:08.599]  He is a radical anti-gunner who openly ruled so on the Texas Supreme Court.
[00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:09.920]  He's also an Enron lawyer.
[00:13:12.322 --> 00:13:17.426]  The guy also was a member of METCHA, whose slogan is, for our race, everything.
[00:13:17.466 --> 00:13:19.168]  For those outside the race, nothing.
[00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.039]  So, I mean, he's a Hispanic David Duke.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.542]  The guy is a complete and total nightmare.
[00:13:26.562 --> 00:13:31.025]  He is the architect of the torture memos, saying that we can torture people until they die.
[00:13:31.045 --> 00:13:31.985]  These are public.
[00:13:32.025 --> 00:13:38.589]  By the way, he was still confirmed to the Attorney General's ship, despite these memos being read by the Senate.
[00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:41.151]  The Senate just said, okay, that's fine.
[00:13:41.551 --> 00:13:48.515]  You know, Senator Kerry on the committee, who... Not John Kerry, but the other Kerry...
[00:13:51.377 --> 00:13:56.460]  Senator Kerry's up there who helped run the Project Phoenix torture squads.
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.941]  I mean, it's just a joke, people.
[00:13:59.321 --> 00:14:15.511]  So whether it's going to be Gonzalez now with the resignation of Sandra Day O'Connor or in the next six months outside next 12 months when Chief Justice Rehnquist steps down who's still battling cancer and basically the living dead.
[00:14:17.589 --> 00:14:21.412]  So this is what's going on right now, and it just shows who Bush is.
[00:14:22.854 --> 00:14:29.319]  I've already gotten emails being attacked as a liberal because I'm against Gonzalez after we put out this report last Friday afternoon.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:34.343]  Within two hours of the announcement, we had still the most detailed report out there.
[00:14:34.363 --> 00:14:37.326]  Unfortunately, other people just don't get it.
[00:14:39.193 --> 00:14:41.514]  And it's now started.
[00:14:41.574 --> 00:14:43.834]  We're evil liberals because we're against Gonzalez.
[00:14:43.874 --> 00:14:48.796]  I heard neocons yesterday doing live talk shows saying we've got to get behind Gonzalez.
[00:14:49.796 --> 00:14:50.876]  There's just no end to it.
[00:14:50.916 --> 00:14:57.578]  So now, if you're pro-abortion, anti-gun, pro-open border, pro-torture, you are a good conservative.
[00:14:57.718 --> 00:14:59.499]  If you are against it, you're an evil liberal.
[00:15:01.511 --> 00:15:09.975]  And by the way, Hillary Clinton has now come out against the open borders, and so now if you are against open borders, you're with Hillary Clinton.
[00:15:10.355 --> 00:15:11.475]  This is total theater.
[00:15:11.855 --> 00:15:13.016]  This is totally staged.
[00:15:13.256 --> 00:15:17.858]  Look, Hillary is hanging out on a weekly basis with Rupert Murdoch at private dinners.
[00:15:18.478 --> 00:15:19.919]  They're preparing to stage her run.
[00:15:20.957 --> 00:15:22.757]  Clinton is vacationing with the Bushes.
[00:15:23.158 --> 00:15:24.958]  It's all staged.
[00:15:25.338 --> 00:15:30.779]  It's always been staged since they killed JFK in Dealey Plaza in 1963.
[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.100]  42 years ago.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.200]  Okay?
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.001]  At the presidential level, it is staged.
[00:15:40.921 --> 00:15:42.542]  Okay, I've just spent eight minutes on this.
[00:15:42.982 --> 00:15:44.182]  We're running out of time here.
[00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:46.951]  I'll just have to try to get into this later.
[00:15:47.691 --> 00:15:55.913]  I beg you to go to PrisonPlanet.com and to get the Gonzalez article he wrote, to get the article on just all the stories and reports we're putting out.
[00:15:56.894 --> 00:15:59.735]  They're totally detailed, and we put a lot of time and energy into this.
[00:16:04.076 --> 00:16:07.277]  We may be attacked by the Free Republic people because we're against Gonzalez.
[00:16:07.397 --> 00:16:07.857]  So be it.
[00:16:09.438 --> 00:16:10.358]  We may be attacked...
[00:16:11.484 --> 00:16:13.065]  And call liberals.
[00:16:14.046 --> 00:16:18.810]  Look, the Second Amendment is more important than being afraid of being called names.
[00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:19.330]  All right?
[00:16:20.291 --> 00:16:21.672]  We've just got to fight, folks.
[00:16:21.692 --> 00:16:23.433]  We've got to fight the phony conservatives.
[00:16:23.813 --> 00:16:24.674]  They've taken over.
[00:16:24.694 --> 00:16:26.015]  They're destroying this country.
[00:16:26.315 --> 00:16:28.657]  They have fooled so many good conservative people.
[00:16:29.598 --> 00:16:32.280]  And if we don't wake conservatives up, we're going to lose.
[00:16:33.581 --> 00:16:37.884]  They just passed Kaftan in the Senate.
[00:16:38.897 --> 00:16:43.822]  They are just doing all this horrible stuff, and the Republicans are voting for it with the Democrats.
[00:16:43.842 --> 00:16:44.362]  We're in trouble.
[00:16:45.884 --> 00:16:47.645]  Now I'm going to spend time on this.
[00:16:47.805 --> 00:16:55.372]  Veteran radio host Paul Harvey triumphs smallpox blankets to Native Americans and black slavery.
[00:16:56.934 --> 00:16:58.515]  That is, he says it's great.
[00:16:59.636 --> 00:17:03.600]  Advocates genocide, ethnic cleansing, biological warfare to fight war on terror.
[00:17:04.733 --> 00:17:06.714]  And he says he's been choking on this for weeks.
[00:17:06.794 --> 00:17:10.296]  And then he just goes into how we grease the skids with black slaves.
[00:17:10.357 --> 00:17:16.941]  We use smallpox blankets, which are in, you know, official government documents, official letters from the time.
[00:17:17.321 --> 00:17:19.402]  We have some of those posted in this article.
[00:17:21.223 --> 00:17:23.905]  And he just says it's time to nuke Saudi Arabia.
[00:17:24.645 --> 00:17:26.086]  Now this is all rhetoric, folks.
[00:17:26.186 --> 00:17:33.591]  Why don't you talk about Mr. Harvey, a former Secretary of State, James Baker, defended successfully the Saudi Royal House of Saad.
[00:17:34.557 --> 00:17:36.437]  Against the widows of 9-11?
[00:17:37.278 --> 00:17:40.358]  Why don't you talk about how Al-Qaeda is CIA funded?
[00:17:41.338 --> 00:17:44.179]  Why don't you talk about how this whole war is staged?
[00:17:46.959 --> 00:18:03.202]  And the scary thing is, folks, some of my earliest memories are being taken to daycare by my father before he went back to medical school and being dropped off and listening to Paul Harvey in the morning.
[00:18:04.267 --> 00:18:05.928]  I grew up listening to Paul Harvey.
[00:18:06.468 --> 00:18:07.629]  I like Paul Harvey.
[00:18:08.449 --> 00:18:13.132]  But we're coming out against him, and he needs to be boycotted and protested.
[00:18:15.013 --> 00:18:18.775]  I mean, folks, Michael Savage says put anybody who disagrees with the government in the camp.
[00:18:19.075 --> 00:18:22.177]  Rush Limbaugh says they're just blowing off steam having fun at Abu Ghraib.
[00:18:22.597 --> 00:18:29.901]  Folks, I have new official government reports where they use drills on people's kneecaps and burn them and electrocute them to death.
[00:18:31.242 --> 00:18:31.902]  This is admitted.
[00:18:32.668 --> 00:18:33.789]  You go, well, they're Al-Qaeda.
[00:18:33.849 --> 00:18:39.792]  No, the Army's own report, 75-90% of those are families picked up at checkpoints.
[00:18:40.492 --> 00:18:43.394]  Well, Paul Harvey's answer is, just nuke Baghdad.
[00:18:43.434 --> 00:18:44.515]  Yeah, 4 million people.
[00:18:44.955 --> 00:18:48.277]  Nuke Riyadh in Saudi Arabia, 3 million people.
[00:18:49.457 --> 00:18:50.578]  Just start nuking.
[00:18:51.739 --> 00:18:54.560]  Just start nuking.
[00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:55.461]  This is so sick.
[00:18:57.324 --> 00:19:07.251]  We're going to come back from the break, and for the documentary purposes, we're going to analyze just two minutes of Mr. Harvey and play this clip.
[00:19:09.292 --> 00:19:14.636]  Well, we've written a six-page article on it, a small print full of hyperlinks documenting what we've said.
[00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:22.141]  Fair has the headline, Paul Harvey's tribute to slavery, nukes, genocide, hateful rant shows, Disney's double standard on speech.
[00:19:22.941 --> 00:19:28.523]  And the Chicago Tribune, Paul Harvey, ah, genocide and slavery, now that's a good day.
[00:19:30.103 --> 00:19:33.304]  And then I found the Free Republic website, praising it.
[00:19:33.324 --> 00:19:37.825]  This is what the grassroots conservatives are saying.
[00:19:37.885 --> 00:19:40.466]  This is total mass evil.
[00:19:41.286 --> 00:19:42.647]  Mass demon possession.
[00:19:44.407 --> 00:19:46.448]  Yes, yes, killing Indians.
[00:19:47.408 --> 00:19:49.609]  Killing, having black slaves.
[00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:50.189]  Ha ha!
[00:19:51.377 --> 00:19:53.280]  No wonder we're in so much trouble.
[00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:54.922]  We've lost our souls.
[00:19:54.942 --> 00:19:56.664]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:56.684 --> 00:19:57.365]  Stay with us.
[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:00.960]  We're good to go.
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:01.620]  We're good to go.
[00:20:21.505 --> 00:20:27.449]  Right now, Midas Resources is offering the 2005 edition of the Red Book, along with a silver dollar for only $22.95.

[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:17.807]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:21:18.247 --> 00:21:24.973]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:21:25.374 --> 00:21:37.144]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:21:37.624 --> 00:21:42.088]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[00:22:00.107 --> 00:22:02.568]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:02.588 --> 00:22:11.850]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Acts number 1 and 2 is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[00:22:12.831 --> 00:22:17.752]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 14th Amendment?
[00:22:18.832 --> 00:22:20.653]  This is minimum infringement.
[00:22:21.053 --> 00:22:21.813]  There may be more.
[00:22:22.773 --> 00:22:23.193]  516-8736 That's 1-800-516-8736
[00:22:53.244 --> 00:22:53.826]  Call now.
[00:22:54.027 --> 00:22:56.739]  Our operators are standing by to take your order.
[00:23:00.226 --> 00:23:05.748]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[00:23:05.888 --> 00:23:06.949]  You wear deodorant, right?
[00:23:07.069 --> 00:23:07.949]  Well, let's hope you do.
[00:23:08.069 --> 00:23:10.910]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:15.972]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[00:23:16.212 --> 00:23:17.292]  Check out this new product.
[00:23:17.452 --> 00:23:20.333]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[00:23:20.713 --> 00:23:24.415]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[00:23:24.575 --> 00:23:24.735]  Look.
[00:23:24.935 --> 00:23:25.415]  We're good to go.
[00:23:45.964 --> 00:23:47.104]  A little goes a long way.
[00:23:47.285 --> 00:23:50.186]  Give them a call at 888-881-NOBO.
[00:23:50.366 --> 00:23:52.827]  Check out their website at no-bo.com.
[00:23:52.987 --> 00:23:56.048]  Come on, it's time for you to enjoy the sweet smell of success with NOBO.
[00:23:56.228 --> 00:23:57.189]  That's no-bo.com.
[00:23:57.229 --> 00:24:09.674]  They railed against the corrupt government.
[00:24:15.399 --> 00:24:24.004]  Those fireworks you saw last night symbolize explosive cannonballs fired from the decks of ships.
[00:24:26.866 --> 00:24:31.809]  They symbolize men charging into battle into their deaths because they believe in freedom.
[00:24:32.889 --> 00:24:38.212]  They don't symbolize your right to wear a pink tutu and run around on PCP.
[00:24:39.693 --> 00:24:42.835]  They symbolize your right to live in a free country and own private property.
[00:24:44.449 --> 00:24:45.710]  All right, Paul Harvey, folks.
[00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:56.980]  You have to understand that when Rush Limbaugh and Michael Savage and Paul Harvey and all these other people and Sean Hannity saying arrest all the militia people, put them in jail, I've seen him say it on Fox News.
[00:24:58.622 --> 00:25:00.123]  None of us are safe.
[00:25:02.405 --> 00:25:07.129]  If your government can do this to people overseas, it can do it here.
[00:25:07.169 --> 00:25:07.790]  And let me tell you,
[00:25:09.227 --> 00:25:10.528]  I've got the Associated Press.
[00:25:10.568 --> 00:25:11.709]  I've got the ACLU.
[00:25:12.089 --> 00:25:22.656]  I've got the New York Times all reporting today that these domestic FBI spy teams are going to be running military cadres in America, folks.
[00:25:22.756 --> 00:25:26.238]  A massive network of tens of thousands of troops.
[00:25:27.078 --> 00:25:28.960]  And it's going to deal with the citizens.
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:29.620]  They admit.
[00:25:31.381 --> 00:25:33.062]  Folks, this is serious.
[00:25:33.082 --> 00:25:34.223]  This is happening.
[00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:52.270]  And so with the backdrop of Muslim extremists and Muslim terrorists, most of which are manufactured creations of the military industrial complex, the globalist mouthpieces like Paul Harvey are able to basically warp the public consciousness into accepting this.
[00:25:53.811 --> 00:25:55.231]  The battle has been joined.
[00:25:56.151 --> 00:26:01.372]  For documentary purposes, here is two minutes of Paul Harvey, the most disgusting part of his diatribe.
[00:26:01.392 --> 00:26:01.772]  Here it is.
[00:26:02.492 --> 00:26:04.913]  I've been choking on something
[00:26:06.303 --> 00:26:10.026]  For weeks, let's get it up and get it out for what it's worth.
[00:26:11.487 --> 00:26:26.918]  After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Winston Churchill said that the American people, he stood the American people, he said, and this is a direct quote, we didn't come this far because we are made of sugar candy.
[00:26:28.419 --> 00:26:30.801]  That was his response to the attack on Pearl Harbor.
[00:26:31.581 --> 00:26:35.224]  That we didn't come this far because we're made of sugar candy.
[00:26:36.374 --> 00:26:38.035]  And that reminder was taken seriously.
[00:26:38.675 --> 00:26:41.016]  And we proceeded to develop and deliver the bomb.
[00:26:41.496 --> 00:26:52.740]  Even though roughly 150,000 men, women, and children perished in Hiroshima and Nagasaki with a single blow, World War II was over.
[00:26:54.021 --> 00:27:04.505]  Following New York's September 11 Pearl Harbor, Winston Churchill was not here to remind us that we didn't come this far because we're made of sugar candy.
[00:27:05.465 --> 00:27:05.625]  So,
[00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:11.854]  Following the New York disaster, we mustered our humanity.
[00:27:13.395 --> 00:27:24.925]  We gave old pals a pass, even though men and money from Saudi Arabia were largely responsible for the devastation of New York and Pennsylvania and our Pentagon.
[00:27:25.982 --> 00:27:36.951]  We called the Saudi Arabians our partners against terrorism and we sent men with rifles into Afghanistan and Iraq and we kept our best weapons in their silos.
[00:27:38.452 --> 00:27:50.781]  Even now we're standing there dying, daring to do nothing decisive because we've declared ourselves to be better than our terrorist enemies, more moral, more civilized.
[00:27:52.122 --> 00:27:54.084]  Our image is at stake, we insist.
[00:27:55.109 --> 00:27:59.130]  But we didn't come this far because we're made of sugar candy.
[00:28:00.071 --> 00:28:10.454]  Once upon a time we elbowed our way onto and into this continent by giving smallpox infected blankets to Native Americans.
[00:28:11.174 --> 00:28:13.455]  Yes, that was biological warfare.
[00:28:14.657 --> 00:28:21.441]  And we used every other weapon we could get our hands on to grab this land from whomever, and we grew prosperous.
[00:28:21.761 --> 00:28:25.343]  And yes, we greased the skids with the sweat of slaves.
[00:28:25.363 --> 00:28:42.073]  And so it goes with most great nation-states, which, feeling guilty about their savage pasts, eventually civilized themselves out of business and wind up invaded and ultimately dominated by the lean, hungry, up-and-coming slaves
[00:28:42.563 --> 00:28:44.988]  Who are not made of sugar candy.
[00:28:45.309 --> 00:28:46.171]  Paul Harvey.
[00:28:46.191 --> 00:28:47.594]  Good day.
[00:28:48.837 --> 00:28:50.520]  All right, Paul Harvey, good day.
[00:28:50.681 --> 00:28:52.064]  Now, that's actually not true.
[00:28:53.178 --> 00:28:56.720]  Rome and countless other civilizations didn't civilize themselves.
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.681]  They got more and more corrupt, more and more vicious.
[00:29:00.021 --> 00:29:06.624]  You know, they'd kill 5,000 people on a single weekend, crucifying them to drive them into submission.
[00:29:06.664 --> 00:29:12.946]  They would pull down entire cities, block by block, and salt the earth, and murder every man, woman, and child.
[00:29:13.827 --> 00:29:15.407]  This is pure evil, folks.
[00:29:16.568 --> 00:29:21.410]  Hitler didn't come out on paper and say, we're going to kill everyone, we're going to kill all our enemies.
[00:29:22.185 --> 00:29:22.965]  He just did it.
[00:29:24.086 --> 00:29:29.848]  But now, Savage and Limbaugh and Harvey just come right out with it.
[00:29:31.349 --> 00:29:32.729]  Smallpox blankets.
[00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:34.830]  Give me a break.
[00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:36.271]  Black slaves.
[00:29:36.311 --> 00:29:37.951]  Hey, we're not made out of sugar candy.
[00:29:38.812 --> 00:29:39.852]  What does this mean?
[00:29:41.593 --> 00:29:44.434]  I mean, I thought the terrorists are bad because they kill indiscriminately.

[00:31:01.695 --> 00:31:12.400]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:17.302]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:17.362 --> 00:31:28.707]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:29.287 --> 00:31:36.157]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:31:36.558 --> 00:31:38.681]  Your purified water is now ready.
[00:31:39.182 --> 00:31:44.149]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[00:32:18.698 --> 00:32:19.278]  We're good to go.
[00:32:34.246 --> 00:32:34.766]  We're good to go.
[00:32:34.786 --> 00:32:35.387]  We're good to go.
[00:33:03.405 --> 00:33:03.846]  Don't worry.
[00:33:04.366 --> 00:33:05.908]  This show is documented.
[00:33:06.408 --> 00:33:09.151]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:09.591 --> 00:33:13.095]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:33:13.135 --> 00:33:17.579]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:33:17.719 --> 00:33:24.766]  Understand, ladies and gentlemen, that if you tune into a Neocon talk show, almost any day you'll hear, let's just nuke all of them.
[00:33:26.342 --> 00:33:32.866]  If you tune into one of these broadcasts, you'll hear, let's put people that disagree with the government in camps, and let's not pay their way.
[00:33:33.247 --> 00:33:34.347]  Let's make them work.
[00:33:34.568 --> 00:33:35.828]  Yes, force the labor.
[00:33:37.309 --> 00:33:39.290]  If you tune in, you'll hear this type of business.
[00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:44.754]  Now, of course, in Saudi Arabia, there's a bunch of different sects of Islamists fighting with each other.
[00:33:46.329 --> 00:34:08.500]  Let's understand that the CIA in the 1950s publicly radicalized the Muslims, paying tens of millions of dollars in Saudi Arabia alone until the 1990s for radical Koran interpretations about how to kill infidels and invade countries, stirring up jihad or holy war and the four pillars of the jihad, or is it five pillars of the jihad?
[00:34:10.261 --> 00:34:11.282]  Over and over again.
[00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:20.205]  Creating and funding the Mujahideen and Al-Qaeda to attack the Serbs, to attack the... to go after Muammar Gaddafi.
[00:34:20.245 --> 00:34:21.466]  I mean, this is all admitted.
[00:34:23.187 --> 00:34:27.631]  Meanwhile, our government flies 8,000 of them out to safety in Afghanistan because they work for the U.S.
[00:34:27.671 --> 00:34:28.071]  government.
[00:34:28.451 --> 00:34:37.118]  Meanwhile, they fly the Saudis and the other Al-Qaeda members out of the country, the other bin Laden members out of the country on September 11th and the two days after.
[00:34:38.962 --> 00:34:42.744]  But we're supposed to ignore all of that and let's just start nuking them.
[00:34:44.065 --> 00:34:46.126]  Listen to the comments of Paul Harvey.
[00:34:46.966 --> 00:34:55.351]  Once upon a time, we elbowed our way onto this continent by giving smallpox-inflected blankets to Native Americans.
[00:34:56.033 --> 00:35:02.500]  Yes, that was biological warfare, and we used every other weapon we could get our hands on to grab this land from whoever.
[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:04.061]  And we grew prosperous.
[00:35:04.522 --> 00:35:06.284]  The message is, you get prosperous.
[00:35:06.644 --> 00:35:09.367]  And yes, we greased the skids with the sweat of slaves.
[00:35:10.508 --> 00:35:11.749]  And he goes on to endorse it.
[00:35:13.791 --> 00:35:17.095]  So, again, the Nazis wouldn't put it on paper.
[00:35:18.368 --> 00:35:23.412]  Wouldn't put out public proclamations of why they were going for Lebensfrau living space.
[00:35:24.013 --> 00:35:27.176]  They wouldn't admit openly what their internal plans stated.
[00:35:28.377 --> 00:35:33.381]  Hitler even used the examples of, look what the Americans did with the smallpox blankets.
[00:35:33.481 --> 00:35:34.522]  That has now been made public.
[00:35:36.003 --> 00:35:37.705]  Those were in internal Nazi documents.
[00:35:37.745 --> 00:35:39.706]  He was advising the party on how to do this.
[00:35:40.027 --> 00:35:41.768]  You know, to develop biological weapons.
[00:35:42.409 --> 00:35:44.751]  That's what Mingala was training to do.
[00:35:46.258 --> 00:35:50.402]  And so we get the Army reports of raping children, raping women, beating people to death.
[00:35:51.223 --> 00:35:55.107]  The Army's own admissions, and Limbaugh comes out and says, Hey, blowing off steam.
[00:35:55.567 --> 00:35:57.049]  Hey, this is how we win the war.
[00:35:57.129 --> 00:35:57.990]  Hey, no big deal.
[00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:06.338]  Do you think you're going to be safe when those individuals from the torture camps, over 100 of them on the planet, come home to America?
[00:36:07.887 --> 00:36:10.568]  Do you think you'll be safe when there are police chiefs and sheriffs?
[00:36:11.108 --> 00:36:23.011]  Negroponte, death squad facilitator, death squad czar, literally, now the head of all domestic intelligence operations, and they're admitting they're going to be operating domestically.
[00:36:23.951 --> 00:36:37.474]  Now the London Observer is reporting the grim world of new Iraqi torture camps, how they drill people's kneecaps and torture them for days, cigarette burns and electricity burns over their bodies, then they shoot them in the head and throw them out on the street.
[00:36:38.786 --> 00:36:42.128]  Even innocent people, they just randomly scoop people up and torture them.
[00:36:43.569 --> 00:36:47.672]  And then, of course, they can't release people who they've been torturing, so they kill everyone.
[00:36:48.073 --> 00:36:49.093]  Oh, that's a nice system.
[00:36:49.113 --> 00:36:50.214]  Well, we've got to be tough.
[00:36:50.554 --> 00:36:51.615]  We've got to be hard.
[00:36:51.975 --> 00:36:53.897]  But you're engaging in double-think, folks.
[00:36:54.297 --> 00:36:55.418]  You know that's bad.
[00:36:55.458 --> 00:36:56.699]  It's bad when Hitler did it.
[00:36:56.959 --> 00:36:59.581]  It's bad when the North Vietnamese did it to our troops.
[00:37:00.081 --> 00:37:02.923]  It was bad when Fidel Castro did it to people.
[00:37:02.963 --> 00:37:04.304]  It was bad when Stalin did it.
[00:37:04.324 --> 00:37:05.685]  It was bad when Caesar did it.
[00:37:06.733 --> 00:37:17.000]  It was bad, ladies and gentlemen, when the Karankawas did it to maroon Spanish sailors in what is Galveston, Texas today.
[00:37:18.101 --> 00:37:18.982]  It's bad.
[00:37:19.882 --> 00:37:20.543]  It's evil.
[00:37:21.603 --> 00:37:33.892]  But what really scares me is, I went to Free Republic, and I knew what I'd find, and anyone here, Paul Harvey today is the top of the story on the 12 pages of comments.
[00:37:35.589 --> 00:37:36.510]  And it's unbelievable.
[00:37:38.871 --> 00:37:39.952]  I haven't really found anybody.
[00:37:39.972 --> 00:37:42.154]  I think there's one person in here that disagrees with it.
[00:37:42.614 --> 00:37:45.436]  I heard him, and he said what I've been saying since the start of the war.
[00:37:45.756 --> 00:37:46.837]  More bombs, less bullets.
[00:37:47.338 --> 00:37:48.198]  I'm with Harvey.
[00:37:49.219 --> 00:37:51.661]  Why let more American boys come home in caskets?
[00:37:51.741 --> 00:37:54.883]  We've got the weapons to end this war now.
[00:37:55.323 --> 00:37:55.583]  F it!
[00:37:57.745 --> 00:38:04.550]  Don't forget about we gave the Indians blankets infested with smallpox as a form of germ warfare crack.
[00:38:05.851 --> 00:38:14.753]  I think Mr. Harvey is suggesting that America go all the way and open up a can of whoop-ay on Islamic terrorism.
[00:38:15.233 --> 00:38:16.994]  Harvey, Paul Harvey is the best.
[00:38:17.054 --> 00:38:20.075]  Thank you, Mr. Harvey, for what you mean to America.
[00:38:20.115 --> 00:38:22.575]  You are truly one of the last true conservatives.
[00:38:23.156 --> 00:38:23.436]  What?
[00:38:24.716 --> 00:38:25.776]  Mr. Harvey is correct.
[00:38:25.876 --> 00:38:27.337]  I've listened to him since 1973.
[00:38:27.417 --> 00:38:28.517]  Today, he was right on.
[00:38:31.218 --> 00:38:32.539]  Do it now or do it later.
[00:38:32.599 --> 00:38:39.746]  I don't think we can be on the same planet without one of us changing our minds, and mine ain't going to change.
[00:38:41.007 --> 00:38:42.128]  I think you hit on the button.
[00:38:43.069 --> 00:38:44.089]  Harvey was saying this.
[00:38:44.129 --> 00:38:49.534]  Yes, we have done some bad stuff to our enemies in the past, and that would be able to do it again instead of crumbling.
[00:38:49.594 --> 00:38:50.315]  It's a war!
[00:38:51.116 --> 00:38:51.436]  Darn it!
[00:38:52.549 --> 00:38:55.891]  Some of our missile subs could unload and take care of the whole problem.
[00:38:56.231 --> 00:39:00.233]  That would definitely qualify as one can of whoop-ay.
[00:39:00.594 --> 00:39:01.714]  Yes, missile subs.
[00:39:01.894 --> 00:39:03.235]  Unload missile subs.
[00:39:03.575 --> 00:39:04.576]  Folks, it goes on.
[00:39:04.616 --> 00:39:05.716]  I'm on page four.
[00:39:06.997 --> 00:39:07.757]  I understand.
[00:39:07.777 --> 00:39:09.078]  And then it goes on.
[00:39:10.299 --> 00:39:13.961]  Folks, it's just... It goes on and on.
[00:39:14.241 --> 00:39:15.302]  I heard it today, too.
[00:39:15.842 --> 00:39:17.383]  It was Paul Harvey at his best.
[00:39:17.543 --> 00:39:21.125]  I was a little surprised to hear him speak so bluntly, but he was spot on.
[00:39:25.911 --> 00:39:35.461]  And then some person who's got military training says, I don't think you take on a bunch of Middle Eastern religious fanatics who are fighting an asymmetrical war by dropping atom bombs on them.
[00:39:36.142 --> 00:39:38.965]  We are winning with what we are doing.
[00:39:39.346 --> 00:39:41.248]  Then they all yell at him and tell him he's an idiot.
[00:39:42.229 --> 00:39:43.270]  Oh yeah!
[00:39:43.771 --> 00:39:44.872]  You know what, tough guys?
[00:39:46.133 --> 00:39:47.715]  I want you to all go enlist.
[00:39:48.303 --> 00:40:05.736]  And then you can go over there like Sergeant Massey and other people we've had on this show, and when you shoot a three-year-old and the baby's guts are everywhere, and you crack and start crying and have nightmares for the rest of your life, then go to Free Republic's website and post disgusting comments.
[00:40:07.698 --> 00:40:14.523]  You know, I've never claimed to live, folks, but I've been in a fight where somebody's beaten me over the head with post hole diggers.
[00:40:15.304 --> 00:40:16.905]  I've seen dead bodies on the street.
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.882]  You know, I have had somebody put a gun to my head.
[00:40:21.062 --> 00:40:29.347]  I've had a little more experience than you, and believe me, real soldiers that have seen death have got a lot more experience than all of us, and they'll tell you this is insane.
[00:40:30.047 --> 00:40:37.712]  We're not talking about the Japanese mainland dropping two A-bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to, quote, scare the Russians.
[00:40:37.752 --> 00:40:45.056]  By the way, three weeks before they had given their unconditional signed surrender, that is publicly admitted.
[00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:52.004]  And just to scare the world and for empire building, they A-bombed the Japanese.
[00:40:53.145 --> 00:40:59.750]  And by the way, ladies and gentlemen, our government took over Japan and used it to de-industrialize this country.
[00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:01.251]  Japan's totally run by the globalists.
[00:41:02.953 --> 00:41:06.996]  And folks, there was a public ten-part plan to get Japan to attack us.
[00:41:08.957 --> 00:41:10.118]  One empire against another.
[00:41:10.198 --> 00:41:11.219]  I'm not defending Japan.
[00:41:13.154 --> 00:41:27.832]  But our government was so cold-blooded that they willingly left 7,000 American men, women, and children in the Philippines, wouldn't let them evacuate for a month before the invasion, because it would be good propaganda for newsreels, 4,000 plus died.
[00:41:28.213 --> 00:41:29.755]  This is now admitted declassified.
[00:41:30.549 --> 00:41:32.150]  That's how cold-blooded your government is.
[00:41:32.231 --> 00:41:36.154]  I don't want to hear, oh, they killed 2,900-and-something people at Pearl Harbor.
[00:41:36.474 --> 00:41:37.515]  Oh, they killed our people.
[00:41:37.595 --> 00:41:39.617]  Nuking them is good, or A-bombing them is good.
[00:41:40.017 --> 00:41:42.319]  If you knew your history, you'd know it was all set up.
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:46.523]  Our government sunk five subs that morning coming into Pearl Harbor.
[00:41:47.624 --> 00:41:50.126]  The generals and admirals were ordered to stand down.
[00:41:50.727 --> 00:41:55.731]  One of the submarines is at the Admiral Nimitz Museum, Pacific Museum in Fredericksburg, Texas.
[00:41:56.051 --> 00:41:56.692]  Don't look at it.
[00:41:56.732 --> 00:41:57.553]  Hidden in plain view.
[00:41:59.853 --> 00:42:04.518]  You didn't know that I've interviewed members of the Flying Tigers on this broadcast?
[00:42:05.739 --> 00:42:15.089]  Two years before Pearl Harbor, our men were in their prop-driven aircraft blowing up Japanese troop trains.
[00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:18.273]  But you're so dumbed down, you don't know anything.
[00:42:18.593 --> 00:42:21.116]  It was a ten-part plan to get them to attack us.
[00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:34.953]  Seven days before they got the actual declassified communique because they'd broken the purple and blue codes, and it was, Admiral Yamamoto will attack on the morning of December 8th and deal a death blow.
[00:42:35.633 --> 00:42:36.333]  One day difference.
[00:42:36.373 --> 00:42:37.573]  Again, they're a day ahead of us.
[00:42:37.613 --> 00:42:39.294]  It was really December 7th in the U.S.
[00:42:39.814 --> 00:42:43.455]  Will attack on the morning at dawn, deal a death blow with 300 aircraft.
[00:42:43.795 --> 00:42:44.555]  And what happened?
[00:42:45.552 --> 00:42:50.234]  They ordered the ships tied together, sent the new aircraft carriers out, and staged that attack.
[00:42:50.495 --> 00:42:51.795]  Now that's just history!
[00:42:51.955 --> 00:42:54.116]  The son of the Admiral has been on this show!
[00:42:54.377 --> 00:42:55.317]  It's all public!
[00:42:58.559 --> 00:43:01.580]  This, you know, so many people think they're part of this elite.
[00:43:02.641 --> 00:43:05.182]  So many people think they're part of the power structure.
[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:15.572]  You think that, oh, we're attacking the Japanese and we're attacking the Vietnamese and we're attacking the Iraqis and we're getting power out of it.
[00:43:15.752 --> 00:43:19.757]  I mean, Paul Harvey says we'll be prosperous if we use biological warfare.
[00:43:20.839 --> 00:43:23.500]  This is how we get prosperous, is having slaves.
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:24.961]  Hey, look in the mirror.
[00:43:25.401 --> 00:43:28.902]  That matter of your skin is as lily white as a lily.
[00:43:29.283 --> 00:43:31.043]  Or if it's as black as night.
[00:43:31.424 --> 00:43:32.904]  They're going to take your private property.
[00:43:32.924 --> 00:43:34.965]  They're going to shoot you up with deadly vaccines.
[00:43:35.105 --> 00:43:37.586]  They're going to push Ritalin and Prozac on your children.
[00:43:38.387 --> 00:43:40.768]  They're going to jack up your property taxes.
[00:43:40.788 --> 00:43:42.048]  They're going to get rid of your borders.
[00:43:42.068 --> 00:43:43.369]  They're going to take your jobs.
[00:43:43.649 --> 00:43:44.469]  You fools!
[00:43:44.509 --> 00:43:46.470]  You're not part of some power structure!
[00:43:49.697 --> 00:43:56.301]  Imagine unloading a nuclear submarine with its, what, 30-something missiles, multiple warheads apiece.
[00:43:57.642 --> 00:43:58.122]  Imagine.
[00:43:58.763 --> 00:44:03.505]  Imagine those submarines, those Triton submarines, launching those missiles.
[00:44:03.606 --> 00:44:07.848]  Imagine them detonating over cities and turning it into a glass parking lot.
[00:44:08.368 --> 00:44:17.154]  Millions of children barbecuing, their heads exploding and popping and being aerosolized as they burn into the ground as black marks.
[00:44:18.228 --> 00:44:20.190]  You are Satan yourself.
[00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:21.411]  What is wrong with you?
[00:44:24.973 --> 00:44:34.301]  The true radical Muslim groups that have actually attacked us in the past are CIA, Mossad, Shin Bet, MI6 controlled, it's public.
[00:44:34.521 --> 00:44:40.886]  Haratz, BBC, AP, UPI, Jerusalem Post.
[00:44:41.526 --> 00:44:42.507]  It all comes out.
[00:44:42.807 --> 00:44:43.528]  You never read it.
[00:44:43.788 --> 00:44:44.749]  You never know about it.
[00:44:47.927 --> 00:44:48.888]  It's staged.
[00:44:50.569 --> 00:44:52.230]  90 plus percent of it is staged.
[00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:58.915]  Now when some random Muslim runs in with a gun and shoots five people and then blows his own head off, yeah, that's real, folks.
[00:44:59.956 --> 00:45:10.243]  But all these truck bombs every time there's about to be a peace process, it's come out, it's turned out, it's admitted that those are Al-Qaeda-controlled, created, Mossad organizations.
[00:45:10.303 --> 00:45:11.544]  That's shin bet.
[00:45:12.645 --> 00:45:14.086]  That's admitted in Haras.
[00:45:14.826 --> 00:45:17.068]  Who stands to gain from all this, you fools?
[00:45:19.272 --> 00:45:20.813]  I'm talking to the Free Republic crowd.
[00:45:20.913 --> 00:45:25.837]  What is wrong with you?
[00:45:26.577 --> 00:45:28.879]  Why are you now defending Alberto Gonzalez?
[00:45:29.119 --> 00:45:30.560]  Because Bush told you so?
[00:45:31.221 --> 00:45:34.343]  Life isn't a football game where you pick a team and you root for it.
[00:45:35.484 --> 00:45:37.225]  The analogy he uses is the Super Bowl.
[00:45:38.286 --> 00:45:39.787]  You know, one of my analogies I use a lot.
[00:45:39.827 --> 00:45:40.607]  It's the best we got.
[00:45:40.628 --> 00:45:44.650]  It's like the Super Bowl and the same owner owns both teams.
[00:45:45.731 --> 00:45:46.852]  It's controlled football.
[00:45:48.507 --> 00:45:55.792]  And I look at 12 pages of people, nuke, nuke, nuke, nuke, nuke Saudi Arabia, nuke, nuke, nuke, nuke, nuke Iran, nuke, nuke everybody.
[00:45:58.013 --> 00:46:11.121]  Meanwhile, ladies and gentlemen, you don't know that they had a democratically elected leader who was anti-communist, pro-free market, wore a suit and a tie, who was secular, Mosaddegh, and our government blew up mosque and shot everybody and blamed it on him and kicked him out in 1953.
[00:46:13.408 --> 00:46:16.510]  You don't know, and you don't want to know the facts.
[00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:26.474]  You want to be a bunch of emotional demons who sit around and say, let's take the restraints off.
[00:46:28.795 --> 00:46:29.676]  You're unbelievable.
[00:46:31.217 --> 00:46:42.342]  And Paul Harvey and the rest of these people get up there on the radio with all the respect they've got, and they say this, do you think you're safe when you've got a government that wants to do stuff like this?
[00:46:44.389 --> 00:47:07.909]  And when the globalist Nuka City in America, when the military-industrial complex detonates a nuke and kills 200,000 people, and when they start the forced labor camps and the total slavery, and when all your freedom is lost and they're taking your private property, you'll be out there waving your new empire flags, your Pan-America flags, and reporting on your neighbors because they didn't show up to the compulsory patriot meeting.
[00:47:08.487 --> 00:47:16.215]  And you're going to feel so good in the little uniform they issue to you until you get arrested because some higher level party member wants your business.
[00:47:16.935 --> 00:47:18.937]  Wants your wife, you fools.
[00:47:19.538 --> 00:47:20.799]  You don't even know what you're entering.
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:22.821]  The globalists are going to carry out attacks.
[00:47:23.042 --> 00:47:24.083]  They're going to bring in a draft.
[00:47:24.163 --> 00:47:25.264]  They are going to nuke people.
[00:47:26.445 --> 00:47:27.806]  But it isn't going to be Saudi Arabia.
[00:47:27.826 --> 00:47:31.390]  It will be some innocent country that can't defend themselves.
[00:47:32.757 --> 00:47:38.863]  And you'll never put two and two together and go, well, why did James Baker defend the Saudis with their connections to 9-11?
[00:47:39.203 --> 00:47:40.244]  Why did Bush defend them?
[00:47:41.045 --> 00:47:46.750]  See, no, you'll just worship Bush and go, get those Saudis, nuke them, nuke them, nuke them, as our government defends and protects them.
[00:47:47.131 --> 00:47:48.492]  It's double-think.
[00:47:48.592 --> 00:47:49.393]  It's insanity.
[00:47:50.454 --> 00:47:55.499]  You're so emotional that you're now even defending Alberto Gonzalez, as we said you would do.
[00:47:56.405 --> 00:47:58.066]  Democrats come out against Gonzalez?
[00:47:58.406 --> 00:48:01.488]  So, my gosh, you're not a Democrat, so you better be foreign.
[00:48:01.528 --> 00:48:05.430]  He's only for torture and abortion and gun control and a matcha member.
[00:48:08.351 --> 00:48:09.492]  There's no end to you people.
[00:48:09.832 --> 00:48:11.593]  You are the scum of the earth.
[00:48:11.713 --> 00:48:13.394]  You are the mindless trash.
[00:48:14.775 --> 00:48:16.916]  You are soft, weak people.
[00:48:17.529 --> 00:48:21.291]  Let's sit there behind your little computer feeling good about yourself.
[00:48:21.351 --> 00:48:23.432]  You've never been in a bad position.
[00:48:23.812 --> 00:48:25.633]  You've never worked hard today in your life.
[00:48:26.053 --> 00:48:33.837]  You've never grown into being a real man who has feelings and compassion and grasps the larger picture.
[00:48:34.297 --> 00:48:35.198]  You're just some little...
[00:48:35.858 --> 00:49:01.068]  A shriveled, frozen in the mindset of a 13-year-old shooting their mouth off about launching missiles, unloading nuclear subs, entire magazines on innocent Muslims who've done nothing to you and who are scared to death with their babies dying in their arms right now from malnutrition, DU, and smart bombs that went awry.
[00:49:03.954 --> 00:49:05.496]  I pray God forgive this country.
[00:49:05.516 --> 00:49:07.478]  You know something, neocons?
[00:49:07.958 --> 00:49:11.502]  Neocon followers, you claim you care about those 3,000 people that died on 9-11.
[00:49:11.662 --> 00:49:13.283]  You better find out who was behind it then.
[00:49:14.445 --> 00:49:20.571]  You claim you care so much about those 3,000 people you're so upset you want to nuke and kill tens of millions of people because you're a tough guy?
[00:49:21.249 --> 00:49:26.190]  Why don't you care about the 50 plus million dead babies this government has allowed the murder of?
[00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:29.931]  See, you don't really care about those little babies because you love Alberto Gonzalez.
[00:49:30.071 --> 00:49:34.592]  Because to you, it's more about a win, a touchdown, getting Gonzalez in.
[00:49:37.933 --> 00:49:39.413]  You are the scum of the earth.
[00:49:39.433 --> 00:49:40.933]  You are the trash of the world.
[00:49:41.293 --> 00:49:42.814]  You are demonic filth.
[00:49:43.554 --> 00:49:45.414]  And you're going to have your time upon this earth.
[00:49:46.414 --> 00:49:49.555]  But it's going to be very short and God's going to punish you.
[00:49:50.876 --> 00:49:58.559]  And we're all, this whole country is going to go into captivity and it isn't going to be some turban-wearing Muslim that's going to enslave you.
[00:49:59.699 --> 00:50:02.280]  They're going to be incinerated and totally annihilated.
[00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:09.243]  It's going to be those you love and you're going to love that evil so much you're going to be praising it as it plows you under.
[00:50:12.184 --> 00:50:13.284]  Mental gymnastics.
[00:50:13.765 --> 00:50:14.925]  You aren't about the issues.
[00:50:14.945 --> 00:50:20.087]  You're about twisting your mind any way to fit into your preconceived notion of the world.
[00:50:21.309 --> 00:50:24.110]  And now, murdering Native Americans is good.
[00:50:24.631 --> 00:50:26.492]  Now, black slavery is good.
[00:50:27.032 --> 00:50:35.836]  Now, grabbing people from their families, putting them on ships, half of them dying, being brought here, being used as slaves, now that's good.
[00:50:35.956 --> 00:50:37.017]  Where is your soul?
[00:50:37.037 --> 00:50:42.299]  See, as soon as you accepted torture, as soon as you accepted all this, you notice you went right to hell.
[00:50:42.659 --> 00:50:44.260]  You went right into the devil's hands.
[00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:50.463]  As soon as you gave in to this, as soon as you went along with this, the race to the bottom was complete.
[00:50:51.354 --> 00:50:53.839]  You had your souls sucked out of you!
[00:50:55.021 --> 00:50:58.226]  I hope you enjoy hell, because that's where you're going.
[00:51:01.391 --> 00:51:01.831]  We're good to go.
[00:51:21.623 --> 00:51:28.288]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:28.488 --> 00:51:32.891]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.

[00:52:00.473 --> 00:52:04.375]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:52:04.595 --> 00:52:10.038]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.

[00:52:20.843 --> 00:52:25.185]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:52:25.365 --> 00:52:33.734]  Trihalomethane and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:52:33.994 --> 00:52:40.341]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.

[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:03.542]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.

[00:54:01.561 --> 00:54:06.704]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:07.385 --> 00:54:09.766]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:09.786 --> 00:54:19.853]  Paul Harvey has been on the radio since 1933.
[00:54:20.153 --> 00:54:20.593]  72 years.
[00:54:21.694 --> 00:54:23.815]  He is, quote, the conscience of America.
[00:54:23.835 --> 00:54:26.597]  And now the conscience of America...
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:32.001]  A person I grew up listening to has turned into a giant demon.
[00:54:33.882 --> 00:54:37.683]  A lord of the Sith, right in front of our very eyes.
[00:54:37.783 --> 00:54:40.043]  Smallpox blankets, yeah, we're tough.
[00:54:40.403 --> 00:54:42.864]  Yeah, black slaves, yeah, we were prosperous.
[00:54:43.144 --> 00:54:44.464]  Yeah, that's how we get it.
[00:54:45.245 --> 00:54:47.405]  What a lie for our children to hear.
[00:54:48.425 --> 00:54:50.386]  What a disgusting thing to say.
[00:54:51.943 --> 00:54:58.549]  None of us are safe, folks, when the icons of this nation are openly advocating nuking people.
[00:54:58.629 --> 00:54:59.129]  Nuke who?
[00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:01.311]  I thought it was a liberation.
[00:55:01.371 --> 00:55:02.672]  I thought it was for WMDs.
[00:55:02.732 --> 00:55:03.833]  I thought they all love us.
[00:55:05.255 --> 00:55:08.778]  Actually, internal polls in Iraq showed about 75-80% were happy.
[00:55:08.798 --> 00:55:09.538]  They didn't like Saddam.
[00:55:09.738 --> 00:55:11.820]  They didn't like the fact our government had helped put him into power.
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:15.003]  And then the extermination began.
[00:55:15.043 --> 00:55:16.124]  The enslavement began.
[00:55:16.945 --> 00:55:18.766]  And some people are fighting.
[00:55:18.806 --> 00:55:19.647]  A lot of it's staged.
[00:55:21.149 --> 00:55:27.754]  And so the answer is, well, when a few people kill some contractors, some mercenaries in Fallujah, the answer is nuke Fallujah.
[00:55:28.515 --> 00:55:34.119]  So the next time there's a mass murder in your city, say Austin, Texas, I guess the feds will just nuke the city from orbit.
[00:55:34.139 --> 00:55:36.260]  They'll put some nukes up there.
[00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:38.282]  If there's a crime, nuke the city.
[00:55:38.382 --> 00:55:41.024]  I mean, it's just craziness.
[00:55:43.205 --> 00:55:45.047]  But it shows hyper-decadence.
[00:55:48.189 --> 00:55:52.071]  Hyper decadence to have these type of things happening.
[00:55:52.111 --> 00:55:54.953]  Folks, there is so much other news here.
[00:55:55.974 --> 00:55:59.375]  But I hope you'll go to prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:56:00.116 --> 00:56:04.899]  And I hope you'll get our analysis of Alberto Gonzalez on track to be your next Attorney General.
[00:56:04.919 --> 00:56:08.841]  I hope you'll get our analysis of Paul Harvey.
[00:56:10.143 --> 00:56:11.724]  We have a London Observer article here.
[00:56:11.844 --> 00:56:14.405]  Grim world of new Iraqi torture camps.
[00:56:14.445 --> 00:56:18.226]  Why don't you go read how they torture somebody to death with the drills?
[00:56:18.306 --> 00:56:24.689]  You know, I saw that film with Chuck Norris at Delta Force where the evil Muslims drill people's knees.
[00:56:25.309 --> 00:56:26.590]  I guarantee you, the sicko U.S.
[00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:32.612]  troops doing that saw that movie, and since they did it to us in the movie, it wasn't real, I will do it to them.
[00:56:32.672 --> 00:56:34.553]  See, these people see all these movies as real.
[00:56:35.393 --> 00:56:37.354]  I went and saw War of the Worlds this weekend.
[00:56:38.323 --> 00:56:39.764]  All 9-11 propaganda.
[00:56:39.804 --> 00:56:40.784]  Dust on their faces.
[00:56:41.144 --> 00:56:42.625]  Planes crashing buildings.
[00:56:44.566 --> 00:56:46.046]  Pictures hanging up on the walls.
[00:56:46.166 --> 00:56:47.587]  All this 9-11 imagery.
[00:56:48.227 --> 00:56:50.328]  And Spielberg admits it's 9-11 imagery.
[00:56:50.348 --> 00:56:51.989]  He goes to the Bilderberg Group routinely.
[00:56:52.269 --> 00:56:53.530]  He's one of their key propagandists.
[00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:56.511]  And people go out of that feeling like we're under attack.
[00:56:56.551 --> 00:56:57.591]  People see movies.
[00:56:58.172 --> 00:57:00.213]  The studies show and take it as reality.
[00:57:01.373 --> 00:57:03.934]  And so the image is the Muslims are the outside enemy.
[00:57:04.234 --> 00:57:05.915]  We've got to exterminate all of them.
[00:57:07.984 --> 00:57:09.085]  And we've got to do it now.
[00:57:11.167 --> 00:57:13.749]  Folks, it's mind control, and you've got to realize this.
[00:57:13.789 --> 00:57:29.364]  Before we end this hour and come back with a guest on a very important issue of globalism, my new film, Martial Law, is out, and it details who the globalists are, what their master plan is, how they carried out 9-11 to scare you into submission, how they bragged about how they would do this publicly.
[00:57:29.584 --> 00:57:32.647]  Oh, yes, we'll carry out terror attacks, then we'll blame it on enemies.
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:35.503]  And the police state, all of it is covered.
[00:57:35.523 --> 00:57:36.445]  It is my best work.
[00:57:36.845 --> 00:57:38.288]  Three hours long.
[00:57:39.189 --> 00:57:40.811]  Toll-free number to get martial law.

[00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:57.010]  Big Brother.
[00:58:57.690 --> 00:58:58.731]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:59.451 --> 00:59:00.552]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:01.212 --> 00:59:02.033]  You want answers?
[00:59:02.793 --> 00:59:03.694]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.354 --> 00:59:08.196]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:08.536 --> 00:59:12.678]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:19.202]  Well, Paul Harvey, the conscience of radio...
[00:59:21.221 --> 00:59:22.882]  He's now been seized by Lucifer.
[00:59:22.942 --> 00:59:25.982]  He's openly saying we should do what we did with the Indians, with smallpox.
[00:59:27.203 --> 00:59:28.463]  Black slavery was good.
[00:59:29.863 --> 00:59:31.924]  Just total evil right out in the open.
[00:59:31.944 --> 00:59:34.085]  They're talking about Alberto Gonzalez for Attorney General.
[00:59:35.305 --> 00:59:38.406]  But good news, they're coming out and admitting Ritalin and Prozac are deadly poisonous.
[00:59:38.446 --> 00:59:39.766]  It's all over the mainstream news.
[00:59:40.246 --> 00:59:41.447]  There's masses of information.
[00:59:41.467 --> 00:59:45.548]  We'll be talking about Codex Alimentarius coming up in a few minutes with a guest, Dr. Green.
[00:59:46.454 --> 00:59:51.275]  We've got Joe Bannister, who just won his case against the IRS, coming up with his lawyers in the third hour.
[00:59:51.955 --> 00:59:54.235]  Right now, let's try to get a few calls in here quickly.
[00:59:54.335 --> 00:59:57.036]  Lori in San Diego, California.
[00:59:57.056 --> 00:59:57.796]  Lori, welcome.
[00:59:58.156 --> 00:59:58.716]  Well, hi.
[00:59:58.776 --> 00:59:59.396]  How you doing?
[01:00:00.116 --> 01:00:01.757]  I spoke to you last week.
[01:00:02.117 --> 01:00:06.437]  I'm the person who used to pick up the bodies in San Diego.
[01:00:06.577 --> 01:00:06.858]  Yes.
[01:00:07.338 --> 01:00:07.778]  Okay.
[01:00:08.258 --> 01:00:15.079]  I've called you several times, and you're on my punishment list, because I want you to come to San Diego.
[01:00:16.972 --> 01:00:17.312]  All right.
[01:00:17.353 --> 01:00:18.474]  Well, unfortunately, I can't.
[01:00:18.514 --> 01:00:19.535]  I literally am tied down.
[01:00:19.575 --> 01:00:20.416]  But what's going on?
[01:00:20.796 --> 01:00:26.382]  Well, you know, I want you to check out all of the corruption going on in San Diego.
[01:00:26.402 --> 01:00:32.709]  Ma'am, there's so much corruption in open admitted evil that I can't even, talking 100 miles an hour, cover it all.
[01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:35.232]  Well, I still want you to come to San Diego.
[01:00:37.316 --> 01:00:42.820]  The city council is up on these corruption charges.
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:48.323]  I think this is a pretty big city.
[01:00:49.344 --> 01:00:58.230]  I'd really like to have you and Dr. Stan and David Eicke and Kathy O'Brien all come together.
[01:01:00.396 --> 01:01:06.879]  But I can reach more people doing a single radio interview than coming somewhere and speaking to a crowd of a thousand people.
[01:01:06.899 --> 01:01:16.404]  Yeah, but I know some pretty high-up people around here that I really think need to understand what's going on.
[01:01:16.424 --> 01:01:18.025]  Well, they need to go to the website, Lori.
[01:01:18.065 --> 01:01:19.866]  Is there any news or information on your mind?
[01:01:19.886 --> 01:01:22.308]  No, not at the moment.
[01:01:22.468 --> 01:01:24.189]  Lori, call me back sometime when I've got more time.
[01:01:24.209 --> 01:01:24.609]  Take care.
[01:01:24.669 --> 01:01:25.689]  Clyde in Louisiana.
[01:01:25.969 --> 01:01:26.750]  Clyde, go ahead.
[01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:28.051]  Mr. Jones.
[01:01:28.371 --> 01:01:28.631]  Yes, sir.
[01:01:29.267 --> 01:01:29.988]  Amen, brother.
[01:01:30.228 --> 01:01:30.628]  Amen.
[01:01:30.668 --> 01:01:31.989]  This country is in trouble.
[01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:33.611]  We're in trouble.
[01:01:33.651 --> 01:01:34.431]  May God help us.
[01:01:34.992 --> 01:01:35.813]  May God help us.
[01:01:36.253 --> 01:01:45.080]  I wanted to ask you, I've been, I've awakened to the New World Order about 10 years ago and I've just finished reading the book by George Orwell, 1984.
[01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:51.806]  And I just kind of wanted to hear your parallels between 1984 and explain to the audience.
[01:01:52.313 --> 01:02:06.382]  Well, there's too many parallels, but torture, false information, propaganda, government-sponsored terrorism to scare the population into submission, the terrorists working for the government, just cameras and microphones everywhere, the family broken up.
[01:02:06.503 --> 01:02:08.184]  I mean, there's just too many parallels.
[01:02:08.484 --> 01:02:11.486]  Secret police everywhere, helicopters looking through your walls.
[01:02:12.026 --> 01:02:13.347]  I mean, just where does it end?
[01:02:13.787 --> 01:02:15.008]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[01:02:15.949 --> 01:02:21.312]  This book, which was written so long ago, can just basically foresee a future like this.
[01:02:22.613 --> 01:02:23.634]  That's all I wanted to say.
[01:02:23.914 --> 01:02:29.056]  Got your video, martial law, bro the tyranny, and I'm doing my best to wake people up here in Monroe, Louisiana.
[01:02:29.236 --> 01:02:32.257]  Claude, what did you think of Paul Harvey's comments?
[01:02:32.877 --> 01:02:33.597]  It's ridiculous.
[01:02:33.677 --> 01:02:42.021]  I mean, I want to know, do these people actually believe the stuff, the garbage that they're spewing, or are they just delusioned?
[01:02:46.425 --> 01:02:47.526]  Oh, I think they're delusional.
[01:02:47.586 --> 01:02:49.086]  I think they believe what they're saying.
[01:02:49.106 --> 01:02:49.927]  These are evil people.
[01:02:50.347 --> 01:02:51.108]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:02:51.128 --> 01:02:53.229]  I mean, my gosh, what we did to the Indians was good.
[01:02:53.249 --> 01:02:54.409]  What we did to blacks was good.
[01:02:54.429 --> 01:02:55.370]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:02:55.590 --> 01:02:57.251]  He's not going to get in trouble for that.
[01:02:57.271 --> 01:03:01.413]  I mean, what do you want to say to Paul Harvey, sir?
[01:03:02.276 --> 01:03:07.158]  I just want to tell him that he needs to wake up and he needs to come back to the light side of the force.
[01:03:07.718 --> 01:03:10.178]  Basically, I mean, this is ridiculous.
[01:03:10.238 --> 01:03:14.940]  I mean, I can't understand how in today's world you can say something like that.
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:15.900]  And where's the backlash?
[01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:17.641]  Where's the backlash from the so-called Democrats?
[01:03:17.661 --> 01:03:21.202]  By the way, if they started nuking Iraq, it would cause even bigger problems.
[01:03:21.322 --> 01:03:24.583]  It isn't like Japan where all the people follow the emperor's orders.
[01:03:25.203 --> 01:03:26.764]  And all you had to do was get to the emperor.
[01:03:27.465 --> 01:03:29.306]  Over there, it would cause even more bedlam.
[01:03:29.346 --> 01:03:32.267]  And they're talking about killing everybody in Iraq, basically.
[01:03:32.668 --> 01:03:33.268]  Genocide!
[01:03:34.229 --> 01:03:37.090]  Yeah, well, I guess this is part of the new freedom, I guess.
[01:03:37.651 --> 01:03:38.371]  New world order.
[01:03:38.831 --> 01:03:39.792]  Yeah, and you know what?
[01:03:39.832 --> 01:03:40.913]  Maybe we're mentally ill.
[01:03:40.953 --> 01:03:42.674]  We just need to take our Prozac, Clyde.
[01:03:44.095 --> 01:03:45.856]  We'll feel better once we have our brain chips.
[01:03:45.896 --> 01:03:46.736]  Clyde, thanks for the call.
[01:03:46.776 --> 01:03:47.316]  God bless.
[01:03:48.697 --> 01:03:49.118]  Stay with us.
[01:03:49.138 --> 01:03:49.678]  We'll be right back.

[01:04:15.985 --> 01:04:23.147]  The casual society control grid, implanable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:04:23.167 --> 01:04:27.669]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:04:27.869 --> 01:04:30.389]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:04:30.610 --> 01:04:37.312]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[01:05:59.987 --> 01:06:02.828]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[01:06:03.008 --> 01:06:07.889]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?

[01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:38.170]  Big Brother.
[01:06:38.190 --> 01:06:38.511]  Mainstream Media.
[01:06:59.512 --> 01:07:00.593]  Government cover-ups.

[01:07:34.432 --> 01:07:37.333]  So we'll be going to your calls coming up in the next segment or so.
[01:07:37.433 --> 01:07:41.595]  I know people want to talk about the new Supreme Court situation, probably be Alberto.
[01:07:41.675 --> 01:07:42.855]  I love Torture Gonzales.
[01:07:43.636 --> 01:07:46.757]  And you're an evil liberal if you're against him because he's anti-gun.
[01:07:46.777 --> 01:07:48.298]  I mean, this is such a joke, folks.
[01:07:49.138 --> 01:07:51.859]  Paul Harvey saying black slavery was a good thing and
[01:07:53.412 --> 01:07:59.677]  Saying that smallpox blankets to the Native Americans was a good thing, and we've got to get tough and start nuking people.
[01:08:00.157 --> 01:08:02.018]  I mean, this is just a mass insanity.
[01:08:02.939 --> 01:08:10.565]  Some good news, though, on the alternative health front, a bunch of information coming out mainstream on what Ritalin does to children, what Prozac does to children.
[01:08:10.625 --> 01:08:18.992]  Now the FDA has had to issue its second warning for adults and suicide, increased suicide risk associated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[01:08:20.456 --> 01:08:22.598]  So, just masses of news.
[01:08:22.678 --> 01:08:31.785]  Joe Bannister in the next hour, the man who just got done beating the IRS, former IRS agent, armed Treasury officer, to be precise.
[01:08:32.786 --> 01:08:48.899]  But, for those that don't know, CAFTA, while you were busy getting the fishing boat ready, or busy getting ready to go camping, or busy getting ready to go see Grandma, getting ready for the nation's birthday, the Declaration of Independence that Thomas Jefferson wrote up,
[01:08:50.079 --> 01:08:59.225]  229 years ago yesterday, and the signing of the Unanimous Declaration of Independence by the 13 independent colonies.
[01:09:01.447 --> 01:09:09.192]  While you were busy doing that, they passed CAFTA in the Senate, the wildly unpopular super bill that will merge us in with Central America.
[01:09:09.232 --> 01:09:13.875]  You thought NAFTA was bad 10 years ago with the massive, what, 5 million jobs lost conservatively.
[01:09:13.895 --> 01:09:15.576]  The media keeps saying 3 million.
[01:09:15.596 --> 01:09:16.557]  It's 5 billion.
[01:09:16.957 --> 01:09:18.358]  That's the Congressional Budget Office.
[01:09:20.049 --> 01:09:36.160]  And if it passes the House, regulations on our Social Security, law enforcement, continental security perimeters, regulations that will tie into international regulations through Canada, that Canada has with the EU, to honor all treaty obligations.
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:38.442]  So then we'll be under Codex Alimentarius.
[01:09:38.962 --> 01:09:44.566]  And for those that don't know what it is, it is this giant private regulatory system similar to the WTO.
[01:09:44.806 --> 01:09:46.808]  The World Trade Organization was set up in 1996.
[01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:51.782]  But already it rules over our Congress.
[01:09:51.882 --> 01:09:53.183]  Well, this will be the same thing.
[01:09:54.404 --> 01:10:02.271]  And it is the big drug companies saying that literally they will decide how much vitamin C you can have over the counter, how much St.
[01:10:02.331 --> 01:10:03.733]  John's wort, you name it.
[01:10:04.954 --> 01:10:09.638]  And that's just one of the wrinkles of this big story.
[01:10:10.979 --> 01:10:14.362]  And through CAFTA and the Free Trade Area of the Americas, we go under this.
[01:10:15.131 --> 01:10:16.052]  And now this nightmare is arriving.
[01:10:43.641 --> 01:10:56.377]  And if you don't believe they'll take your supplements, folks, and make them basically prescriptions sold to you at high prices by the drug companies, then you need only look at the Supreme Court ruling of two Thursdays ago on private property.
[01:10:56.778 --> 01:10:57.559]  They're doing it!
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:00.162]  Dr. Green, good to have you on with us, sir.
[01:11:00.643 --> 01:11:08.513]  Alex, thanks for the opportunity to be with you and your good listening audience and really for the fight for truth and being able to get this out to the masses.
[01:11:08.533 --> 01:11:10.836]  And I really appreciate the opportunity to be able to do that.
[01:11:10.936 --> 01:11:11.417]  Well, thank you.
[01:11:11.477 --> 01:11:16.083]  It's a complex issue, but first off, tell us about yourself, the organization, any key websites.
[01:11:16.603 --> 01:11:16.823]  It truly is.
[01:11:16.843 --> 01:11:19.366]  It's something that, you know, I've worked with a couple of different organizations.
[01:11:19.386 --> 01:11:22.668]  Dr. Matthias Rath, who has been fighting it for a number of years, who had worked with Linus Pauling.
[01:11:37.313 --> 01:11:43.440]  I have done a lot of key lectures for him across the country, and we've been warning people about this Codex issue.
[01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:55.614]  It was something that is very hard to get a grasp on, and really when you look at the whole complexity of it, the Codex really is an outpocketing of two joint committees.
[01:11:55.634 --> 01:11:58.577]  You have the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations,
[01:11:59.031 --> 01:12:00.593]  And then the World Health Organization.
[01:12:00.653 --> 01:12:08.121]  What they were trying to do was to formulate one single standard governing the sale of food and food supplements across the country or across the world.
[01:12:08.581 --> 01:12:11.945]  And so this whole globalization that you're talking about is exactly right.
[01:12:12.425 --> 01:12:17.010]  What we have to remember is that with where we stand...
[01:12:17.532 --> 01:12:22.740]  I think that we have to remember that it's not going to affect our laws right now.
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:32.394]  And what you had done very eloquently is to say that the CAFTA, the Central American Free Trade Agreement, that is really going to be the burgeoning aspect of what's going on.
[01:12:32.899 --> 01:12:37.182]  And to really see if we're going to have to follow these guidelines that Codex has now implemented.
[01:12:37.202 --> 01:12:38.563]  Well, this is what they do.
[01:12:38.583 --> 01:12:41.845]  They pass a global tax, and then they implement it five years later.
[01:12:42.346 --> 01:12:46.509]  Or they pass an income tax at one-half of 1%, and 20 years later it's at 40%.
[01:12:47.069 --> 01:12:48.150]  They know what they're doing.
[01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:50.852]  For those that don't know, I've read the documents.
[01:12:51.212 --> 01:12:52.653]  The claims you've been hearing are true.
[01:12:52.713 --> 01:12:56.694]  It's like when they say, well, free trade area of the Americas doesn't take our sovereignty.
[01:12:57.075 --> 01:12:59.776]  Well, then you actually read the treaties.
[01:12:59.796 --> 01:13:01.757]  That's exactly what it does.
[01:13:02.097 --> 01:13:04.018]  So there's a lot of deception here.
[01:13:05.018 --> 01:13:07.699]  Well, what you're seeing is exactly right.
[01:13:07.759 --> 01:13:13.422]  I mean, when you have CAFTA, which is 1,000 pages of fine print, it will bind the U.S.
[01:13:13.482 --> 01:13:16.083]  into this new global arrangement that we're talking about.
[01:13:16.522 --> 01:13:23.244]  And it really sets us up for failure and being able to have our rights taken away as far as being able to get supplement.
[01:13:23.344 --> 01:13:31.346]  Well, you heard my analysis and my analogy of the WTO set up in the mid-'90s, totally private and has more power than Congress on trade.
[01:13:31.766 --> 01:13:32.326]  Absolutely.
[01:13:32.526 --> 01:13:35.427]  Levying what, $10 billion fines in some cases?
[01:13:35.627 --> 01:13:38.648]  Well, you've got to realize that the World Trade Organization has...
[01:13:39.855 --> 01:13:44.059]  Really, in 42 out of 48 cases, it's gone against the U.S.
[01:13:44.319 --> 01:13:49.344]  So to say that this is not going to affect us in some way is going to be sadly mistaken.
[01:13:49.384 --> 01:13:50.945]  Tell us what Codex is specifically.
[01:13:51.005 --> 01:13:52.326]  I mean, it's just like New Freedom.
[01:13:52.367 --> 01:13:59.433]  It's written up by the drug companies, passed in friendly countries, and then if we sign treaty deals, we have to follow those obligations.
[01:13:59.473 --> 01:14:00.374]  Those are now happening.
[01:14:00.594 --> 01:14:02.576]  Give us the tales of what it will do if they get their way.
[01:14:03.036 --> 01:14:09.301]  Well, when you look at it from this standpoint, the Codex Committee met yesterday.
[01:14:09.341 --> 01:14:11.603]  Their meeting in Rome, Italy started yesterday.
[01:14:12.003 --> 01:14:18.708]  They have already passed the guidelines now for Codex that will be a world, I guess, perspective on it.
[01:14:19.029 --> 01:14:21.831]  And when you look at this, what's going to happen is that
[01:14:22.623 --> 01:14:28.608]  We are going to be in the middle of being able to have certain supplements being taken away from us over time.
[01:14:29.048 --> 01:14:30.269]  Now, this has already happened.
[01:14:30.289 --> 01:14:33.572]  And they'll use certain things to demonize certain things.
[01:14:33.952 --> 01:14:35.413]  Oh, this makes you have a heart attack.
[01:14:36.414 --> 01:14:40.478]  To demonize the entire spectrum of vitamins and things in people's minds.
[01:14:40.758 --> 01:14:41.598]  No question about it.
[01:14:41.638 --> 01:14:46.903]  I mean, when you look at the safety of the food supplement industry, it's unparalleled.
[01:14:46.923 --> 01:14:48.384]  I mean, there's nothing that comes close.
[01:14:48.843 --> 01:14:58.426]  And you look at the pharmaceutical and drug industry, to me it's the third leading cause of death, but if you read Carolyn Dean and Gary Knoll's work, it's the leading cause of death in this country.
[01:14:58.446 --> 01:15:02.047]  A couple hundred thousand deaths a year, admittedly, from drug reactions.
[01:15:02.227 --> 01:15:02.788]  Absolutely.
[01:15:03.308 --> 01:15:08.610]  And so with supplements, what they've done is taken examples like tryptophan that was pulled off the market in 1989.
[01:15:10.086 --> 01:15:11.687]  Saying, well, we have to make sure it's safe.
[01:15:12.008 --> 01:15:23.357]  Well, all that happened was that you had a company called Shoah Dinka that did not filter their product, and it created a problem with a muscular disorder that killed about 145 people.
[01:15:23.657 --> 01:15:30.022]  When you look at the whole picture, though, tryptophan has been really used very safely.
[01:15:30.543 --> 01:15:36.888]  Pharma kills 285,000 last year's numbers, and supplements from sometimes people putting bad ingredients in a couple hundred.
[01:15:37.228 --> 01:15:39.009]  Absolutely or less, realistically.
[01:15:39.049 --> 01:15:42.091]  I think our industry as a whole is very safe.
[01:15:42.111 --> 01:15:44.732]  Well, why would you die every year from bad hamburger meat?
[01:15:44.752 --> 01:15:46.033]  I mean, are we going to ban hamburger meat?
[01:15:46.353 --> 01:15:48.174]  Well, I think that's what it's coming down to.
[01:15:48.214 --> 01:15:52.197]  I think that you're going to look at serious codex guidelines under other issues.
[01:15:52.217 --> 01:15:58.060]  We're going to be looking at genetically modified organisms, radiation, antibiotics, hormones, pesticide residues.
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:07.550]  You're going to look at the Monsanto being able to use the Roundup Ready crops in these countries where they have to keep getting the seeds from Monsanto to grow their crops.
[01:16:07.670 --> 01:16:08.070]  Exactly.
[01:16:08.110 --> 01:16:13.716]  We always look at what CAFTA does to America, but it does even worse stuff to these other countries.
[01:16:14.036 --> 01:16:19.382]  Well, what it's going to do is that we're going to eventually lower our standards to these other countries.
[01:16:19.967 --> 01:16:21.728]  And that's what's going to happen down the road.
[01:16:21.748 --> 01:16:23.129]  Doctor, you mentioned this.
[01:16:23.850 --> 01:16:24.510]  Let me just read this.
[01:16:24.650 --> 01:16:28.533]  FDA issued second suicide warning for adults on SSRIs.
[01:16:28.553 --> 01:16:29.153]  That's Prozac.
[01:16:29.173 --> 01:16:31.155]  Associated Press yesterday.
[01:16:31.755 --> 01:16:32.976]  Here's the Houston Chronicle.
[01:16:33.316 --> 01:16:35.658]  Closer look for possible Ritalin cancer link.
[01:16:35.698 --> 01:16:37.299]  Everybody knows Speed does that.
[01:16:37.639 --> 01:16:38.260]  Here's another one.
[01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:41.102]  Ritalin, aspartame, chromosome damage, killing kids.
[01:16:41.662 --> 01:16:42.663]  I mean, how many articles?
[01:16:43.423 --> 01:16:45.405]  Well, I mean, they come on and on every day.
[01:16:45.445 --> 01:16:49.148]  And what's nice is I've been able to really catalog quite a few of these articles.
[01:16:49.208 --> 01:16:52.171]  And as we see, when do you see the supplements?
[01:16:52.191 --> 01:16:56.795]  There's really nothing in there showing that supplements are really doing any harm.
[01:16:57.135 --> 01:17:04.041]  And yet what Codex is now doing, they're misapplying a toxic chemical risk assessment model to helpful nutrients.
[01:17:04.451 --> 01:17:10.557]  So what's going to happen is that they're looking at only the risk side of supplements and not the benefit.
[01:17:11.018 --> 01:17:12.339]  And that's really what the Codex is about.
[01:17:12.359 --> 01:17:18.726]  So that's not even our normal standard because they, quote, look at the benefits of Ritalin when, you know, quote, outweighing the bad benefits.
[01:17:18.906 --> 01:17:19.507]  Absolutely.
[01:17:19.607 --> 01:17:22.590]  And so when you look at the aspect of what's going to happen...
[01:17:23.110 --> 01:17:29.234]  I think that we're going to be seeing lower standards across the world of what is available.
[01:17:29.334 --> 01:17:35.439]  So in other words, they're going to lower vitamin C to let's say from 2,000 milligrams to 200 milligrams.
[01:17:35.739 --> 01:17:37.920]  Vitamin D will drop from like 50 IUs to 5 IUs.
[01:17:39.352 --> 01:17:43.095]  Vitamin E from 1,000 daily IUs to maybe 15 IUs.
[01:17:43.115 --> 01:17:48.659]  That'll be illegal for stores to sell it in higher increments, and they're admitting they're going to track how many bottles you buy.
[01:17:49.259 --> 01:17:55.884]  Well, and what's going to happen too is that you're going to see that it's going to be synthetic isolates that are going to be primarily available.
[01:17:56.324 --> 01:18:04.631]  And you're seeing a lot of these companies that are in the pharmaceutical industries that are already readying for these standards because they knew what was coming down the pike.
[01:18:04.671 --> 01:18:05.492]  Because they wrote them.
[01:18:05.692 --> 01:18:11.017]  So basically it's economic warfare as well, not just a control issue going after a great industry.
[01:18:11.582 --> 01:18:29.123]  Well, I believe so, and what's sad about it is that you have many within our own industry that really feel that Codex is not going to be an issue, and that the Dietary Supplement Health Education Act of 1994, which really saved our industry, and it took over 2.6 million people writing letters
[01:18:29.563 --> 01:18:31.364]  Well, Dr. Green, stay right there.
[01:18:31.404 --> 01:18:33.745]  I want to talk about solutions and ways to fight this.
[01:18:33.765 --> 01:18:35.746]  This is only one issue in CAFTA and FTAA.
[01:18:35.766 --> 01:18:36.266]  This is globalization.
[01:18:36.286 --> 01:18:37.127]  Total control of your life.
[01:18:37.147 --> 01:18:37.687]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:52.589 --> 01:18:56.253]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:18:56.674 --> 01:19:02.100]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:07.666]  It makes me wonder if a US citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:19:08.366 --> 01:19:21.674]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Rule in 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:19:22.175 --> 01:19:27.478]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:19:27.778 --> 01:19:33.662]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[01:19:34.002 --> 01:19:34.062]  1-800-686-2237
[01:19:51.733 --> 01:19:55.234]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:19:55.474 --> 01:19:58.974]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:19:59.074 --> 01:20:03.015]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:20:03.235 --> 01:20:09.396]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:20:09.816 --> 01:20:17.718]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:20:18.158 --> 01:20:23.480]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:27.402]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:20:27.762 --> 01:20:29.663]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:20:29.703 --> 01:20:31.864]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:20:32.104 --> 01:20:37.026]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[01:20:37.086 --> 01:20:41.168]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-
[01:20:42.928 --> 01:20:45.550]  803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[01:20:50.953 --> 01:20:53.474]  David J. Smith for News Watch Magazine.
[01:20:54.094 --> 01:21:03.339]  Have you ever wondered what former President George Herbert Walker Bush meant in 1990 by saying the Desert Storm War was a good chance to start the New World Order?
[01:21:04.259 --> 01:21:11.023]  The New World Order would cause us to lose our freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and also our national sovereignty.
[01:21:11.963 --> 01:21:13.424]  Is this what Americans want?
[01:21:13.624 --> 01:21:16.706]  To be merged into a communist-style one-world government?

[01:23:09.906 --> 01:23:12.188]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:23:13.308 --> 01:23:21.314]  I'm jumping in a lot on Dr. Chris Green, who, of course, is on the board of the Coalition for Health Freedom, coalitionforhealthfreedom.org.
[01:23:21.334 --> 01:23:21.434]  Doc...
[01:23:25.242 --> 01:23:30.365]  You know, it's just like the Supreme Court ruling two weeks ago about taking private property for private use.
[01:23:30.385 --> 01:23:32.226]  People said, oh, don't worry, that's just in this case.
[01:23:32.266 --> 01:23:39.010]  And now all over the country, from Texas to California to New York, they're moving to take private property for private use.
[01:23:39.610 --> 01:23:41.091]  People are in systemic...
[01:23:41.886 --> 01:23:43.628]  Well, this has happened.
[01:23:43.648 --> 01:23:46.970]  I mean, when you look at it, I don't think it's just happened overnight.
[01:23:46.990 --> 01:23:51.314]  I think this is something that's been coming down the pike for quite a long time.
[01:24:07.527 --> 01:24:14.014]  Unfortunately, the news media, conventional news media, is not covering the real issues here.
[01:24:14.034 --> 01:24:19.981]  It's shows like yours that are getting this word out and being able to raise people's awareness.
[01:24:20.041 --> 01:24:22.824]  I do a radio show here in the Atlanta area.
[01:24:23.479 --> 01:24:23.799]  That's right.
[01:24:23.819 --> 01:24:25.661]  I think I'm going to be on your broadcast the 13th.
[01:24:25.681 --> 01:24:26.041]  Yes, sir.
[01:24:26.141 --> 01:24:26.461]  You sure are.
[01:24:39.861 --> 01:24:40.842]  I'll look forward to that.
[01:24:40.862 --> 01:24:42.582]  Why don't you tell folks about the station?
[01:24:43.223 --> 01:24:44.163]  It's WGUN.
[01:24:44.203 --> 01:24:45.184]  It's 1010 AM.
[01:24:45.264 --> 01:24:47.625]  Actually, they are working on becoming internet streaming.
[01:24:47.705 --> 01:24:49.986]  We are a 50,000-watt station in the Atlanta area.
[01:24:50.006 --> 01:24:52.287]  Yeah, that's one of the biggest stations on the East Coast.
[01:24:52.568 --> 01:24:52.928]  It is.
[01:24:53.068 --> 01:25:08.736]  It covers quite a range, and we have been talking about health issues primarily, but we've had to obviously get into the political arena based on what's going on with the Central American Free Trade Agreement, and now what is... It's ironic that the Codex Commission...
[01:25:08.996 --> 01:25:10.598]  No, I mean... Yeah, when is it normally on?
[01:25:10.618 --> 01:25:11.259]  All right.
[01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:30.172]  Well, that should be a very important broadcast.
[01:25:30.633 --> 01:25:31.453]  What are solutions?
[01:25:31.473 --> 01:25:32.775]  I mean, obviously, education.
[01:25:32.815 --> 01:25:33.856]  We've got to warn people.
[01:25:34.236 --> 01:25:36.438]  Well, a couple things that I think that are important right now.
[01:25:36.538 --> 01:25:42.804]  We have, as you mentioned, that the House has already passed the CAFTA resolution, and now it's... I mean, excuse me, the Senate.
[01:25:43.164 --> 01:25:45.026]  And now that's going to be up to the House.
[01:25:45.106 --> 01:25:45.767]  Now, this week...
[01:25:46.688 --> 01:25:56.677]  As Congress is not in session, is the time to get to your Congressman and talk about CAFTA and talk about Codex and your concerns with that.
[01:25:57.117 --> 01:26:08.047]  And so my recommendation at this point is to get with your Congressman locally and to tell him your concern about CAFTA because they will vote on it, I'm assuming, around July 11th.
[01:26:08.767 --> 01:26:10.489]  And we will know by next week.
[01:26:10.856 --> 01:26:12.117]  Where we stand with Captain.
[01:26:12.198 --> 01:26:14.440]  I'm really nervous about that vote.
[01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:22.269]  Well, Captain is wildly unpopular, like the open borders and everything else, and major polls were upwards of 90% against it.
[01:26:23.977 --> 01:26:30.142]  It was only 65% against NAFTA back in 1994 before people knew the details, but still we had the majority.
[01:26:30.542 --> 01:26:37.747]  It's unconstitutional, it's un-American, plus everybody's against it, but the Senate passed it, and the House committees passed it too.
[01:26:38.227 --> 01:26:45.673]  Well, what was concerning me is that Orrin Hatch, who has been a big supporter of the vitamin supplement industry, approved it as well, and I'm like, well...
[01:26:46.293 --> 01:26:50.897]  People are saying, well, we don't have to worry about what's going on here because we have the Shea.
[01:26:51.217 --> 01:26:52.438]  The Shea is under attack.
[01:26:52.478 --> 01:26:55.801]  The Dietary Supplement Health Education Act is under attack.
[01:26:56.381 --> 01:27:00.544]  And you have many congressmen and many senators that wish that it was repealed.
[01:27:00.804 --> 01:27:06.529]  But what you have, because again, probably most of their campaign contributions are being funded by the pharmaceutical industries.
[01:27:07.097 --> 01:27:08.657]  Well, not probably.
[01:27:08.677 --> 01:27:12.919]  They're one of the biggest contributors, and we know they're the biggest buyer of advertising.
[01:27:13.139 --> 01:27:16.340]  I mean, if you watch the nightly news, sometimes half the ads are pharma.
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:25.402]  Well, and what you see is that they've really become a monopoly, and that we can't talk about or bring in the idea of alternatives.
[01:27:25.502 --> 01:27:27.943]  It's really suppression more so than anything.
[01:27:29.443 --> 01:27:31.143]  Well, it certainly is.
[01:27:31.384 --> 01:27:35.385]  Doctor, these callers will be all over the map, but it will all tie back in the globalization.
[01:27:35.425 --> 01:27:35.885]  Stay with us.
[01:27:35.945 --> 01:27:38.025]  I want to come back and take some calls.
[01:27:38.045 --> 01:27:43.227]  But before we go to break here, what are some of the key websites we can visit to find out the details?
[01:27:43.387 --> 01:27:48.508]  Well, Kevin Miller has produced a beautiful documentary on the CAFTA and the Codex situation.
[01:27:48.568 --> 01:27:51.969]  It's www.welltv.com.
[01:27:51.989 --> 01:27:54.930]  That's W-E-L-L-T-V dot com.
[01:27:55.470 --> 01:28:05.733]  You can also go to our website, www.coalitionforhealthfreedom.org, and it has an action link, and it also, I think, has a link to the documentary.
[01:28:05.753 --> 01:28:17.777]  The documentary, Kevin Miller, wonderful documentary filmmaker that won awards when he wrote the Let Truth Be the Bias about 11 years ago, and this was on the Deshaies Act.
[01:28:17.877 --> 01:28:20.977]  Now he's done the same thing on We Become Silent on Codex.
[01:28:20.997 --> 01:28:22.718]  So those two websites definitely hit.
[01:28:23.843 --> 01:28:24.343]  All right.
[01:28:24.383 --> 01:28:25.404]  Well, that's important.
[01:28:25.444 --> 01:28:27.524]  People need to get educated on this.
[01:28:27.804 --> 01:28:28.965]  It's not coming.
[01:28:29.045 --> 01:28:29.965]  It's here, folks.
[01:28:30.365 --> 01:28:31.406]  We'll be right back, Doctor.
[01:28:31.626 --> 01:28:32.366]  Please stay with us.
[01:28:32.846 --> 01:28:35.907]  And we'll take your calls on the other side, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:36.187 --> 01:28:39.369]  presentplanet.tv and infowars.com are my websites.
[01:28:39.389 --> 01:28:40.189]  Check them out today.
[01:28:42.410 --> 01:28:43.330]  We're on the march.
[01:28:43.770 --> 01:28:45.411]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:45.431 --> 01:28:48.972]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:51.997 --> 01:28:52.537]  Again, that's 888-211-1715.
[01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:23.741]  Get your 2005 Red Book and genuine silver dollar today.
[01:29:23.761 --> 01:29:24.061]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:29:52.273 --> 01:29:53.913]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:29:54.033 --> 01:29:58.114]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:29:58.274 --> 01:30:01.155]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:01.235 --> 01:30:07.957]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:08.137 --> 01:30:11.137]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:11.338 --> 01:30:13.738]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:13.858 --> 01:30:21.760]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:23.681]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:30:51.698 --> 01:30:54.240]  Americans are under a covert medical attack daily.
[01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:57.883]  These chemicals are affecting our brains and may well destroy our society.
[01:30:58.003 --> 01:30:58.383]  Shocking?
[01:30:58.483 --> 01:30:58.944]  Of course!
[01:30:59.204 --> 01:31:01.266]  But what you don't know can indeed kill you.
[01:31:01.426 --> 01:31:04.328]  Big business buries the truth and silences the majority.
[01:31:04.528 --> 01:31:05.889]  Forewarned is forearmed.
[01:31:06.049 --> 01:31:10.313]  Order your copy of the book Secret Assassins of Food by Dr. Ott Ph.D.
[01:31:10.493 --> 01:31:11.914]  only through Mother Earth Minerals.
[01:31:12.094 --> 01:31:12.635]  We're good to go.
[01:31:12.655 --> 01:31:13.435]  We're good to go.
[01:31:34.036 --> 01:31:38.040]  Ordering the book Secret Assassins of Food only from Mother Earth Minerals, Inc.
[01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:42.104]  for only $16.95 plus shipping and handling by calling toll-free 866-989-9876.
[01:31:42.144 --> 01:31:43.045]  That's toll-free 866-989-9876.
[01:31:43.065 --> 01:31:45.047]  Or visit MotherEarthMineralsInc.com today.
[01:32:01.758 --> 01:32:04.640]  Your call is coming up momentarily for Dr. Chris Green.
[01:32:05.580 --> 01:32:06.941]  Talking about globalization.
[01:32:06.981 --> 01:32:08.042]  Cap to pass the Senate.
[01:32:09.243 --> 01:32:10.723]  The House has passed it out of committee.
[01:32:10.904 --> 01:32:12.585]  It could be in the next week or so.
[01:32:12.645 --> 01:32:15.847]  They're saying it'll probably pass the House unless you get on the stick.
[01:32:16.727 --> 01:32:18.488]  Oh, just a small note here for listeners.
[01:32:19.209 --> 01:32:25.712]  A lot of people image my operation, what I do with my films, as some giant organization.
[01:32:26.653 --> 01:32:29.615]  And you get mad if I don't email you back or if I don't respond to your letters.
[01:32:30.365 --> 01:32:31.566]  Keep the letters and email coming.
[01:32:31.586 --> 01:32:34.808]  You sent us a lot of great info, but I really can't respond to 98% of it.
[01:32:35.728 --> 01:32:41.812]  I've only got three employees, and I guess four if you count a part-time employee.
[01:32:41.852 --> 01:32:43.313]  I'm a small operation.
[01:32:43.973 --> 01:32:47.575]  We do reach tens of millions of people, but nevertheless, we are small folks.
[01:32:48.656 --> 01:32:50.497]  And we are undercapitalized.
[01:32:51.038 --> 01:32:51.838]  We are focused.
[01:32:51.958 --> 01:32:52.819]  We are researchers.
[01:32:52.899 --> 01:32:54.119]  We are educated on the facts.
[01:32:54.159 --> 01:32:55.000]  We are effective.
[01:32:55.700 --> 01:32:58.062]  But the real power comes from you being leaders.
[01:32:59.051 --> 01:33:05.937]  If I get another call, you know, another phone call, I get them every day, Alex, you need to do this, you need to do that, you need to do more on this issue, you need to come here, you need to go there.
[01:33:07.299 --> 01:33:08.500]  Folks, we can't do it all.
[01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:13.324]  We bring you the best guests, the best activists, the best minds fighting, you know, a thousand different fronts.
[01:33:14.686 --> 01:33:21.492]  And, you know, how we fund this operation and how we bring you all these guests and try to support what they're doing is with my documentary films.
[01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:34.574]  Not to mention the fact that these really are some of the best documentaries out there on the New World Order, on who the globalists are, on who's behind the terrorism, on the police state, on the land grabs, on the forced drugging, on all the control.
[01:33:36.554 --> 01:33:47.017]  And really, these videos will not be seen unless you get them and you make copies and you air them on AXS TV and you show them at your local college campus or at your VFW hall or at the local library.
[01:33:47.918 --> 01:33:51.959]  And I want to thank all the listeners that have been activists, that have taken action, that have done so much.
[01:33:54.289 --> 01:33:57.453]  And I want to ask those that have taken action to do more in this fight.
[01:33:58.775 --> 01:34:03.500]  And I want to ask all those that know what's happening but haven't gotten actively involved to please get involved.
[01:34:04.862 --> 01:34:10.369]  And a great way to start is getting Martial Law, my new film, that covers the police state and 9-11 like no other film.
[01:34:11.303 --> 01:34:15.806]  Then it gets into who the globalists are, their mindset, their ideology, what their master plan is.
[01:34:16.206 --> 01:34:17.167]  It is my best film.
[01:34:17.267 --> 01:34:18.628]  My other films are excellent as well.
[01:34:18.708 --> 01:34:23.111]  Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Police State's Retotal Enslavement, American Dictators.
[01:34:23.431 --> 01:34:27.814]  Some of these videos are just $5.95 a piece.
[01:34:28.955 --> 01:34:30.336]  That's the kind of specials we've got.
[01:34:30.356 --> 01:34:31.837]  It's because I want to get them out to people.
[01:34:32.838 --> 01:34:35.479]  You basically make no profit on them at that price, but I don't care.
[01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:37.841]  The goal is to get the information out.
[01:34:39.170 --> 01:34:43.812]  So the toll-free number to order the films is 1-888-253-3139.
[01:34:44.473 --> 01:34:48.154]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:34:48.715 --> 01:34:55.078]  Or go to InfoWars.com to peruse our safe, secure shopping cart, our bookstore, and video store there.
[01:34:55.118 --> 01:34:58.680]  I carry a lot of other great titles and videos on a host of important issues.
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:00.200]  All the best stuff is there.
[01:35:00.661 --> 01:35:01.901]  InfoWars.com.
[01:35:02.461 --> 01:35:03.602]  Watch free clips of the films.
[01:35:03.682 --> 01:35:04.222]  Read about them.
[01:35:04.242 --> 01:35:05.443]  But whatever you do, get them today.
[01:35:06.903 --> 01:35:08.544]  Or call toll-free to get the films, 1-888-253-3139.
[01:35:08.564 --> 01:35:09.284]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:35:09.324 --> 01:35:13.065]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:35:13.165 --> 01:35:21.429]  And last but not least, you can go to prisonplanet.tv, 15 cents a day, and see all my films, read my book, Paul Watson's book, print off copies, my weekly TV reports.
[01:35:36.423 --> 01:35:39.964]  We charge 50 cents a day because we couldn't do this without charging for the bandwidth.
[01:35:40.024 --> 01:35:46.846]  It's just become... I started PrisonPlanet.tv 15 months ago because I couldn't afford the three servers we had at the time.
[01:35:46.866 --> 01:35:49.947]  We were going to have to shut it down or quit giving free videos.
[01:35:50.007 --> 01:35:55.489]  So a lot of the videos feel free, but some of it is for subscription, and you do support us by doing that.
[01:35:56.049 --> 01:35:57.270]  And we need your support, folks.
[01:35:57.750 --> 01:35:58.430]  It's just that simple.
[01:35:59.579 --> 01:36:00.800]  That's how you donate to us.
[01:36:00.940 --> 01:36:01.861]  That's how you support us.
[01:36:02.241 --> 01:36:08.404]  Going back to Dr. Green, Dr. Green, we're going to go to calls here right now, but anything else that's important that we need to be aware of?
[01:36:08.545 --> 01:36:16.529]  Well, just the fact is this, is that number one, you mentioned the issues about Prozac and Ritalin and what's going on with these black box warnings.
[01:36:16.569 --> 01:36:19.311]  I mean, people need to wake up to the fact that we are not...
[01:36:19.651 --> 01:36:20.171]  I think so.
[01:36:43.588 --> 01:36:44.389]  And they go crazy.
[01:36:44.429 --> 01:36:50.153]  They either commit suicide or they have these mass rampages that we saw in Minnesota with that Jeff kid.
[01:36:50.614 --> 01:36:55.898]  And it's just very, very, I think, scary the fact that we are not waking up to that fact.
[01:36:55.938 --> 01:37:00.621]  I think that your listeners are waking up to that fact, but it's getting that message nationally.
[01:37:00.661 --> 01:37:09.548]  When you have over 70% of the country using some form of alternative medicine at this point, having this freedom, like you say, eventually taken away.
[01:37:09.588 --> 01:37:10.489]  It's very insidious.
[01:37:10.549 --> 01:37:11.850]  It's not going to happen right now.
[01:37:12.190 --> 01:37:12.651]  Well, here's the analogy.
[01:37:12.671 --> 01:37:15.393]  Galveston, Texas, roughly every 35 years, gets covered with water.
[01:37:26.718 --> 01:37:28.118]  And the biggest disaster in U.S.
[01:37:28.158 --> 01:37:34.380]  history, something like 15,000 died, going from memory on that number, but about half the people on the island died.
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:37.600]  So they finally built a seawall which has stopped that.
[01:37:38.081 --> 01:37:41.201]  Well, a few years down the road, they're going to take this stuff off the shelves.
[01:37:41.541 --> 01:37:43.102]  Are we going to build the seawall now?
[01:37:43.142 --> 01:37:44.962]  Are we going to defeat this globalization now?
[01:37:45.342 --> 01:37:46.903]  Are we going to continue to let this happen?
[01:37:48.143 --> 01:37:49.103]  It's just that simple.
[01:37:49.303 --> 01:37:53.124]  We have to stop procrastinating and support what you and others are doing, Dr.,
[01:37:53.996 --> 01:37:55.097]  Well, I appreciate that, Alex.
[01:37:55.157 --> 01:37:55.717]  I really do.
[01:37:55.817 --> 01:37:59.160]  But, yeah, I mean, let's take some callers and let's see what they think.
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:00.000]  All right.
[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:04.323]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dave in New York.
[01:38:04.363 --> 01:38:05.684]  Dave, or you're on the air.
[01:38:05.724 --> 01:38:06.044]  Go ahead.
[01:38:06.525 --> 01:38:07.405]  Or Darren, excuse me.
[01:38:07.425 --> 01:38:07.746]  Go ahead.
[01:38:08.326 --> 01:38:08.526]  Hey.
[01:38:08.566 --> 01:38:09.046]  Hi, Alex.
[01:38:09.067 --> 01:38:09.607]  How are you doing?
[01:38:09.727 --> 01:38:09.967]  Good.
[01:38:10.588 --> 01:38:10.848]  All right.
[01:38:10.888 --> 01:38:12.289]  I just want to say I'm a new listener.
[01:38:12.309 --> 01:38:13.309]  I don't get to call often.
[01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:16.151]  I work two jobs here in New York, so I stay busy.
[01:38:16.211 --> 01:38:22.656]  But I'm also a new member of Prison Planet and GCN, and you're doing a great job there.
[01:38:23.303 --> 01:38:27.347]  I know it's a hard job you're faced with, but you're doing a great job there.
[01:38:27.387 --> 01:38:30.750]  But I'd like to say hi to your guest also, Dr. Green.
[01:38:31.031 --> 01:38:31.511]  Thank you, Darren.
[01:38:31.531 --> 01:38:32.232]  I appreciate that.
[01:38:32.772 --> 01:38:33.153]  All right.
[01:38:33.213 --> 01:38:41.561]  I know it's a shame with this cast and what they're doing, and I'm really into my nutrients also and my vitamins because the food is so bad.
[01:38:42.786 --> 01:38:49.732]  Now, you said somewhere down the line, as far as the timeline, what are you looking at to try to put this in place?
[01:38:49.852 --> 01:38:52.355]  Well, just a real brief thing that we haven't talked about.
[01:38:52.395 --> 01:38:54.076]  That was the European Food Directive.
[01:38:54.136 --> 01:38:59.361]  And, Alex, I don't know if you know much about that, but that is really the precursor of what Codex is really based on.
[01:39:00.042 --> 01:39:07.269]  That had a ruling April 5th from the Alliance for Natural Health by Dr. Rob Burkirk, who was fighting that food directive.
[01:39:07.791 --> 01:39:17.938]  And that food directive is essentially, as of August 1st this year, is going to remove approximately 75% of the supplements in the European Union off the shelves.
[01:39:18.018 --> 01:39:27.784]  Now, Robert Kirk and his organization fought and won a lawsuit on that, but the final ruling on that was supposed to take place before the Codex meeting.
[01:39:28.286 --> 01:39:34.449]  Unfortunately, the powers that be, they pushed it to July 12th, which is three days after the Codex finishes.
[01:39:34.469 --> 01:39:38.231]  But, Andre, I don't know as much as you do about this, but I've been studying it, again, for about eight years.
[01:39:38.731 --> 01:39:42.573]  Bottom line, if they get this through, we're looking at about two years before this starts.
[01:39:42.833 --> 01:39:44.274]  About two years, approximately.
[01:39:44.314 --> 01:39:45.215]  That is correct.
[01:39:45.255 --> 01:39:49.897]  What you're going to see is the final draft, I think, guidelines that will be wrapped up in defining...
[01:39:50.257 --> 01:39:53.118]  The World Health Organization upper safe limit.
[01:39:53.338 --> 01:39:58.580]  So basically the sentence is coming down here in the next few weeks, and then we'll just be on death row?
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:39:59.940]  That's the way I look at it.
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:05.042]  I think it's going to be a matter of, I think when you look at the whole picture, they want to have the world...
[01:40:05.834 --> 01:40:09.657]  Totally dominated by 2010, December 31st, 2009, actually.
[01:40:09.877 --> 01:40:12.640]  They've openly said that, and it's funny you said that.
[01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:19.205]  By 2008, we see every one of their programs, national ID cards, all of it, by 08, enforced by 010.
[01:40:19.305 --> 01:40:22.568]  We're going to wake up tomorrow, folks, and it's going to be 08, 010.
[01:40:23.429 --> 01:40:24.269]  We've got to fight this.
[01:40:24.349 --> 01:40:25.030]  Anything else, Darren?
[01:40:25.986 --> 01:40:28.328]  No, I originally called to say something about Paul Harvey.
[01:40:28.668 --> 01:40:29.189]  No, say it.
[01:40:29.269 --> 01:40:29.669]  Go ahead.
[01:40:29.709 --> 01:40:39.916]  You covered it all, brother, but he doesn't realize black Americans have been some of the greatest patriots, and Native Americans have been some of the greatest patriots that this country's seen in every war.
[01:40:40.356 --> 01:40:47.261]  For those that don't know, he said, hey, we got tough and gave them smallpox blankets, and we greased the skins with black slaves, and we've got to get tough again and use nukes.
[01:40:47.681 --> 01:40:49.162]  I mean, he's endorsing this stuff.
[01:40:49.182 --> 01:40:49.783]  It's pure evil.
[01:40:50.299 --> 01:40:50.860]  Right, right.
[01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:57.285]  And when people fall into that and think that they're going to be part of this new world order, that's when the surprise is going to come into it.
[01:40:57.325 --> 01:40:58.225]  That's all I want to say.
[01:40:58.265 --> 01:41:01.108]  Thank you, Darren.
[01:41:01.128 --> 01:41:02.148]  I can't get names straight today.
[01:41:02.189 --> 01:41:02.629]  Excuse me.
[01:41:03.349 --> 01:41:07.473]  Let's go ahead and talk to Daniel in Texas.
[01:41:07.533 --> 01:41:08.313]  Daniel, go ahead.
[01:41:08.333 --> 01:41:15.299]  I'm glad to be a Prison Planet TV subscriber coming up on my annual renewal here this week.
[01:41:15.779 --> 01:41:16.540]  Well, thank you, sir.
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:17.120]  And...
[01:41:18.621 --> 01:41:25.148]  Very quickly, last week you had Representative Court out of San Antonio on regarding the Constitutional Amendment.
[01:41:26.009 --> 01:41:27.491]  I finally got to read that.
[01:41:27.691 --> 01:41:29.313]  It's as weak as it can be.
[01:41:29.353 --> 01:41:38.282]  He has absolutely no teeth, and I'd appreciate it if you could get him back on and hold his feet to the fire about how weak that proposed amendment is.
[01:41:39.506 --> 01:41:57.478]  Okay, Darrell, you're talking about the state rep I had on from San Antonio concerning the situation with Freeport, Texas, where they're trying to take private property away from somebody for a private marina, and you're saying you've read the legislation, which I have to admit I've been so busy I just scanned over it, and you're saying it's weak?
[01:41:58.018 --> 01:42:04.823]  Yes, the proposed constitutional amendment that they're wanting to put on the ballot in November...
[01:42:05.672 --> 01:42:07.773]  It has absolutely no teeth.
[01:42:07.853 --> 01:42:09.333]  It will not change a thing.
[01:42:09.353 --> 01:42:12.114]  It's just a grandstanding action.
[01:42:13.755 --> 01:42:15.736]  It looks good, but it does nothing.
[01:42:16.036 --> 01:42:17.176]  Well, that's just classic.
[01:42:17.196 --> 01:42:27.020]  And you know, going back to Dr. Green, Chris Green, who is, of course, on the board of Coalition for Health Freedom, and the website there is coalitionforhealthfreedom.org,
[01:42:29.031 --> 01:42:30.672]  You know, the phony war on drugs.
[01:42:30.692 --> 01:42:32.392]  We've got more drugs on the streets than ever.
[01:42:32.432 --> 01:42:40.075]  Now we're going to have this war on supplements, literally making them illegal if they have their way, if it's not distributed by big pharma.
[01:42:40.455 --> 01:42:48.017]  Really, it gets back to controlling our own lives, controlling what we put in our bodies, and it ties into this other private property issue.
[01:42:48.077 --> 01:42:52.139]  It's just private property and freedom of choice is under attack at every level.
[01:42:52.179 --> 01:42:52.439]  Doctor?
[01:42:52.799 --> 01:42:53.540]  Well, absolutely.
[01:42:53.580 --> 01:43:07.977]  When you look at that problem that forced vaccinations, where people think they have to have these vaccines, you look at the problem with the food and the food quality that we're looking at in this country, and our choices just slowly really being whittled away.
[01:43:08.358 --> 01:43:11.782]  I mean, we're looking at the population being reduced.
[01:43:12.225 --> 01:43:14.707]  And it's a very great plan in how they're doing that.
[01:43:14.787 --> 01:43:17.528]  And I mean, I hate to say that, but that's exactly what's happening here.
[01:43:17.809 --> 01:43:19.289]  We have these rights taken away.
[01:43:19.309 --> 01:43:23.512]  You're going to see more and more people get sick and suffer more and more degenerative diseases.
[01:43:23.572 --> 01:43:28.615]  As we've seen over the last hundred years in this country, the amount of degenerative diseases has skyrocketed.
[01:43:28.675 --> 01:43:34.059]  Doctor, they had a report last year on CBS locally, but it was put out nationwide.
[01:43:35.544 --> 01:43:40.787]  And it openly said that mercury is good for you, contrary to popular belief.
[01:43:40.827 --> 01:43:45.010]  I mean, they're getting that crazy where they're saying mercury in vaccines is good for children.
[01:43:45.310 --> 01:43:48.532]  Mercury is a known toxin, carcinogen, end of story.
[01:43:48.572 --> 01:43:50.973]  I mean, at no level is it good for you at all.
[01:43:51.114 --> 01:43:58.798]  Well, I've seen the scientific reports by major mainstream medical institutions that it is the most destructive heavy metal in the brain, the most reactive.
[01:43:59.098 --> 01:44:05.002]  Well, where we're getting the most sources are, I mean, when you look at what a child goes through by the time he's two years of age,
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:13.047]  He has gotten over 200 times the amount that's considered safe.
[01:44:13.067 --> 01:44:14.008]  250 times, yeah.
[01:44:14.129 --> 01:44:14.729]  Absolutely.
[01:44:15.170 --> 01:44:29.204]  And so when you look at that aspect of it, and then you look at what's going on with these kids in mercury fillings, and then the dental profession is not acknowledging that, and the problems that you look at with the vapors from those being secreted over year after year after year,
[01:44:29.924 --> 01:44:35.386]  And 25 years later, you're seeing the same vapors being secreted by these mercury fillings.
[01:44:35.446 --> 01:44:39.047]  No wonder we're having the degenerative conditions that we're having in our society.
[01:44:39.247 --> 01:44:40.728]  All right, Daniel, thanks for the call.
[01:44:40.748 --> 01:44:41.308]  Great points.
[01:44:41.368 --> 01:44:43.369]  In fact, let's play this 45-second clip.
[01:44:43.789 --> 01:44:46.089]  This is from KI Action News here in Austin.
[01:44:46.129 --> 01:44:46.410]  Here it is.
[01:44:47.790 --> 01:44:49.272]  ...vaccines may have on kids.
[01:44:49.532 --> 01:44:52.856]  A life-saving device wins over-the-counter approval by the FDA.
[01:44:53.157 --> 01:44:55.199]  And sick of your glasses and contact lenses?
[01:44:55.279 --> 01:44:57.962]  A new corrective eye surgery is approved today.
[01:44:57.983 --> 01:45:01.407]  Here's tonight's medical headlines with medical watch reporter, Seema Mathur.
[01:45:04.028 --> 01:45:09.993]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[01:45:10.473 --> 01:45:16.878]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives in vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[01:45:16.918 --> 01:45:24.324]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[01:45:24.704 --> 01:45:29.928]  And of course, those were government-funded studies, so I would expect to start seeing mercury pills on the store shelves, doctor.
[01:45:31.010 --> 01:45:42.428]  Well, I mean, that's very laughable because when you look at what's happening is that we're looking at different things that are going on within the brain that the mercury really creates a real pathogenic approach to it.
[01:45:42.933 --> 01:45:49.458]  And what's going on there is that we're seeing this correlation with autism and these vaccinations.
[01:45:49.498 --> 01:45:52.621]  For those that don't know, it moves like a living creature.
[01:45:52.681 --> 01:45:57.285]  It literally burns through the brain like acid and continues moving from neuron to neuron.
[01:45:57.325 --> 01:46:00.347]  We have the electron microscope video on the website.
[01:46:00.807 --> 01:46:06.452]  Whereas other heavy metals just toxify and kill them slowly, mercury actually short circuits them and they explode.
[01:46:07.097 --> 01:46:22.343]  Well, David Kennedy has another website, www.iaomp.org, and he goes into that fact and showing how mercury accumulates in various organs and tissues and creates that devastation.
[01:46:22.403 --> 01:46:25.365]  But according to them, I mean, next we'll hear cyanides nutritious.
[01:46:25.525 --> 01:46:26.705]  Arthur in Kansas City.
[01:46:26.785 --> 01:46:27.586]  Arthur, go ahead.
[01:46:27.886 --> 01:46:28.566]  This is Kansas.
[01:46:29.747 --> 01:46:30.767]  I've got two things here.
[01:46:31.614 --> 01:46:36.296]  When Bush was governor of Texas, he appointed a Gonzalez to the Supreme Court down there.
[01:46:36.336 --> 01:46:37.516]  Is that the same Gonzalez?
[01:46:37.556 --> 01:46:43.598]  The guy that's pro-abortion, the guy that's anti-gun, the guy that was a member of MEXA, the guy that says torture is good.
[01:46:43.658 --> 01:46:44.818]  Yes, Enron lawyer.
[01:46:45.358 --> 01:46:48.339]  He said Al Gonzalez in Texas.
[01:46:48.419 --> 01:46:49.520]  Is that the same one here?
[01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:50.280]  Yes, sir.
[01:46:50.580 --> 01:46:52.100]  That's Alberto Gonzalez.
[01:46:52.561 --> 01:46:55.882]  Okay, I've got one other thing here that might tie in with this CAFTA thing.
[01:46:56.162 --> 01:47:00.363]  When Bush made his speech the other night, the offstage announcer introduced him as
[01:47:00.854 --> 01:47:02.697]  The President of the United States.
[01:47:03.218 --> 01:47:04.319]  Not of America.
[01:47:04.460 --> 01:47:05.722]  Just the United States.
[01:47:07.284 --> 01:47:08.366]  Meaning the hemisphere.
[01:47:10.217 --> 01:47:11.097]  Interesting.
[01:47:11.117 --> 01:47:15.259]  That may have just been somebody not reading their cue card correctly, but that's what we're going into regardless.
[01:47:15.319 --> 01:47:23.001]  I mean, we have the Canadian papers come right out, Dr. Green, and admit that CAPTA is the beginning of the end of their sovereignty, but you don't see that in our papers, Doctor.
[01:47:23.301 --> 01:47:23.881]  No, we don't.
[01:47:23.941 --> 01:47:26.162]  And unfortunately, it is the beginning of the end.
[01:47:26.202 --> 01:47:32.944]  When you look at what's going on, I mean, it's really the final step, the likely last step to be able to create the free trade area of the Americas.
[01:47:33.604 --> 01:47:40.148]  That's really, I think that's going to be on the agenda before Bush leaves office to have that completely in place.
[01:47:41.188 --> 01:47:43.990]  Oh boy, thank you Arthur in Kansas.
[01:47:44.610 --> 01:47:45.491]  Who is up next here?
[01:47:45.531 --> 01:47:46.931]  I've got my call list scrambled.
[01:47:48.632 --> 01:47:50.253]  John in Las Vegas, Nevada.
[01:47:50.293 --> 01:47:51.494]  Welcome John, you're on the air.
[01:47:51.854 --> 01:47:54.556]  Yes Alex, don't be too surprised about Paul Harvey.
[01:47:55.176 --> 01:47:58.538]  I pulled this off of the Shrine of North America's site.
[01:47:58.578 --> 01:48:01.980]  He was initiated as a Freemason on September 30th of
[01:48:03.092 --> 01:48:03.833]  I knew that, yes.
[01:48:21.434 --> 01:48:26.578]  Will that codex allow for powdered supplements where you can control your dosage or not?
[01:48:26.718 --> 01:48:26.939]  No.
[01:48:27.679 --> 01:48:38.088]  The way I'm looking at it and reading it, they're trying to really restrict any type of supplement like that because what they're looking at is trying to get very rigid...
[01:48:38.848 --> 01:48:42.912]  Yeah, I've read a bunch of it, just to jump in here.
[01:48:42.932 --> 01:48:54.422]  And what they do is they only authorize vitamins and minerals that are delivered into the caplet as part of a very expensive process to shut out competition.
[01:48:54.442 --> 01:48:57.925]  And as the doctor said, those tend to be the synthetic types.
[01:48:58.345 --> 01:48:59.026]  Go ahead and...
[01:48:59.586 --> 01:49:00.126]  Go ahead, doctor.
[01:49:00.166 --> 01:49:01.027]  No, exactly right.
[01:49:01.067 --> 01:49:02.488]  You said it exactly right.
[01:49:02.528 --> 01:49:11.893]  And what's going to happen is that you're going to see these minute levels that will be available, really, and what they're looking at is they're not really going to have any biological value whatsoever.
[01:49:12.073 --> 01:49:14.234]  I mean, it's going to be really laughable what's available.
[01:49:14.514 --> 01:49:15.154]  One final thing.
[01:49:16.055 --> 01:49:27.501]  When my child was born, I looked into all the vaccine inserts, and on the MMR insert that I got from the immunology place was it actually...
[01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:30.602]  Well, sir, it's all the viruses and bacteria and things.
[01:49:30.622 --> 01:49:33.103]  You want to get a comment from the doctor on that?
[01:49:33.123 --> 01:49:35.224]  Well, I'll tell you, I think... Stay there, Doc.
[01:49:35.244 --> 01:49:37.185]  We'll do a minute on the other side.
[01:49:37.266 --> 01:49:39.287]  And we've got the third hour coming up, folks.
[01:49:39.307 --> 01:49:39.647]  Stay with us.
[01:49:53.388 --> 01:49:56.249]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:56.509 --> 01:49:58.089]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:58.430 --> 01:50:03.091]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:03.431 --> 01:50:07.893]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:50:08.293 --> 01:50:12.454]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:12.694 --> 01:50:15.517]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:15.617 --> 01:50:20.281]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:20.481 --> 01:50:24.885]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:25.145 --> 01:50:32.372]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:32.612 --> 01:50:35.034]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[01:50:35.194 --> 01:50:36.936]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[01:50:52.589 --> 01:50:53.230]  We're good to go.
[01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:14.831]  radioactive poisoning.
[01:51:14.911 --> 01:51:20.795]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:20.975 --> 01:51:26.099]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:26.199 --> 01:51:35.065]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:35.325 --> 01:51:38.628]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:52:48.335 --> 01:52:49.195]  Call now.
[01:52:54.757 --> 01:53:00.800]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:53:01.380 --> 01:53:04.321]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:06.465 --> 01:53:11.628]  Former special agent assigned to the Treasury, Joe Bannister, talking about his big court victory.
[01:53:12.148 --> 01:53:14.109]  We'll be coming up with his lawyers in the next hour.
[01:53:14.129 --> 01:53:18.091]  A bunch of other news in a short time to cover it all.
[01:53:18.972 --> 01:53:24.615]  Take a few final calls from Wesley and David, and then that's going to be it with this important guest, Dr. Green.
[01:53:25.754 --> 01:53:37.579]  But Dr. Green, people don't know that the vaccines are literally bread in these different soups of animal and human tissues, and that they find all these weird viruses and bacteria and DNA fragments.
[01:53:37.599 --> 01:53:43.462]  This is admitted in the vaccines that are causing, in many cases, more health problems than they supposedly even treat.
[01:53:43.502 --> 01:53:43.822]  Comments?
[01:53:44.122 --> 01:54:01.805]  Well, when we see, like, the polio vaccine, for instance, and we're finding now that many tumors, cancerous tumors, have the SV40 virus, the simian virus 40 virus that is a part of the tumor, obviously what we're seeing is that these things are not working, that actually when you look at
[01:54:02.561 --> 01:54:17.874]  Even still now, 250,000 people a year still suffer with some paralytic polio, and this is despite the fact that two vaccines, one available since 1955, the other since the early 60s, are basically not working in these third world countries.
[01:54:18.034 --> 01:54:26.621]  Well, they admitted that the smallpox vaccine they wanted to give medical workers, who, by the way, refused almost unanimously, would actually give many people smallpox.
[01:54:26.681 --> 01:54:28.263]  Let's take two final calls.
[01:54:28.343 --> 01:54:29.624]  Wetherly in Tennessee, go ahead.
[01:54:30.552 --> 01:54:33.636]  Hi, I'll make this as short as I possibly can.
[01:54:33.896 --> 01:54:34.997]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:54:36.259 --> 01:54:50.455]  Doctor, I would like to stock up on vitamins, and I wonder if you have any suggestions as to what we can do to lengthen the shelf life of those vitamins, refrigeration, freezing, or...
[01:54:51.519 --> 01:54:52.339]  Do you have any ideas?
[01:54:52.359 --> 01:54:53.280]  That's a good question.
[01:54:53.320 --> 01:55:03.324]  I mean, at this point, the major thing that I would be looking at if I were going to do anything, and what I keep in my own medicine cabinet is I use a lot of North American Urban Spices oil of oregano.
[01:55:03.999 --> 01:55:11.665]  I think it's one of the more broad-spectrum killers, antimicrobials, I mean, fungus, bacteria, virus, I mean, even bacteria that mutates.
[01:55:11.685 --> 01:55:13.926]  Yeah, bottom line, Wesley, we want to defeat this.
[01:55:13.946 --> 01:55:15.348]  We don't want to have to store it.
[01:55:15.368 --> 01:55:17.429]  I mean, most vitamins go bad in a few years.
[01:55:17.629 --> 01:55:18.110]  Exactly.
[01:55:18.170 --> 01:55:22.113]  Dark, cold places, generally, but some vitamins that will actually destroy them.
[01:55:22.373 --> 01:55:25.055]  So we can't, you know, it's too big of a subject to give advice on that.
[01:55:25.095 --> 01:55:27.957]  I want to take a final call from Puerto Rico, but anything else, Wesley?
[01:55:29.628 --> 01:55:30.869]  Just one thing I was going to say.
[01:55:30.889 --> 01:55:38.113]  I've been taking oregano now daily for eight years with my wife, and neither one of us have had a cold or the flu in the last eight years.
[01:55:38.253 --> 01:55:38.773]  There you go.
[01:55:39.093 --> 01:55:40.114]  And no shots.
[01:55:40.894 --> 01:55:41.975]  Thanks for the call, Wesley.
[01:55:42.795 --> 01:55:43.956]  David in Puerto Rico.
[01:55:43.996 --> 01:55:44.856]  David, welcome, sir.
[01:55:46.057 --> 01:55:46.677]  Yeah.
[01:55:46.757 --> 01:55:47.858]  Alex, how are you doing?
[01:55:48.138 --> 01:55:48.418]  Good.
[01:55:48.878 --> 01:55:50.739]  Yeah, I just want to give a call.
[01:55:50.759 --> 01:55:54.461]  I just want to say we just saw your film, 9-11 Rise of the Police Day.
[01:55:54.641 --> 01:55:54.961]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:56.502 --> 01:55:57.863]  At our school in Puerto Rico.
[01:55:58.729 --> 01:55:59.949]  And I just want to give you a compliment.
[01:55:59.969 --> 01:56:00.850]  It's an awesome film, man.
[01:56:00.870 --> 01:56:03.210]  A lot of our people basically woke up what's going on here.
[01:56:03.230 --> 01:56:03.730]  Oh, really?
[01:56:03.770 --> 01:56:04.911]  How many people saw the film?
[01:56:05.431 --> 01:56:08.352]  Well, it was a class of about 300 people saw it.
[01:56:09.212 --> 01:56:13.733]  And basically, you know, we looked at your website, and it's very powerful stuff you have.
[01:56:13.833 --> 01:56:15.534]  Oh, did they show it in the auditorium?
[01:56:16.654 --> 01:56:18.915]  Oh, yeah, we showed it in the auditorium, yeah.
[01:56:19.055 --> 01:56:19.975]  It's really awesome.
[01:56:20.055 --> 01:56:22.356]  And we're going to show it again on Thursday.
[01:56:23.276 --> 01:56:27.097]  Again, another show, and it's a very powerful film.
[01:56:28.010 --> 01:56:29.611]  Very, very, very, very powerful.
[01:56:29.651 --> 01:56:33.893]  Well, I want to thank whoever, the teacher, the student that got that shown, and God bless you.
[01:56:34.473 --> 01:56:36.474]  And also, he just mentioned also about vitamins.
[01:56:36.494 --> 01:56:40.755]  There are also, I mean, a lot of vitamins here in stores here, and a lot of them are out of date.
[01:56:40.775 --> 01:56:44.297]  And he just mentioned also, I mean, there's a lot of vitamins here in the stores here.
[01:56:44.337 --> 01:56:46.258]  A lot of them come from the States.
[01:56:47.091 --> 01:56:49.252]  And you realize a lot of them are basically outdated.
[01:56:49.272 --> 01:56:50.393]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:56:50.413 --> 01:56:51.634]  You've got to do research.
[01:56:51.674 --> 01:56:53.435]  Doctor, final comments on what he just said?
[01:56:53.695 --> 01:57:11.065]  Well, I think overall, just keeping up the good work of what your show is doing and being able to get people aware of what's happening and that the freedoms are being really breached in many areas and being able to really wake up the collectiveness because people seem to be in a coma and there's a lot of apathy out there.
[01:57:11.705 --> 01:57:14.407]  A lot of that has to do with bad nutrition and bad water.
[01:57:14.427 --> 01:57:15.088]  It truly does.
[01:57:15.508 --> 01:57:15.868]  All right.
[01:57:15.888 --> 01:57:18.330]  Well, Dr. Green, we really appreciate you coming on with us.
[01:57:18.350 --> 01:57:22.533]  We'll have to get you and your colleagues back up in the near future as we watch the fight over CAFTA.
[01:57:22.873 --> 01:57:24.654]  Now in the House, already past the Senate.
[01:57:24.674 --> 01:57:25.415]  Thank you for coming on.
[01:57:25.735 --> 01:57:26.596]  Alex, thanks very much.
[01:57:26.616 --> 01:57:27.216]  I appreciate it.
[01:57:27.336 --> 01:57:27.737]  Thank you.
[01:57:27.757 --> 01:57:29.218]  And thank you, David, from Puerto Rico.
[01:57:31.900 --> 01:57:36.803]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:42.472 --> 01:57:45.814]  Hello!
[01:57:48.376 --> 01:57:49.037]  Big Brother.
[01:57:49.677 --> 01:57:50.758]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:51.458 --> 01:57:52.639]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:54.060]  You want answers?
[01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:56.722]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.742 --> 01:58:00.024]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:00.525 --> 01:58:04.688]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:04.708 --> 01:58:08.790]  All right, folks, we are now in tune.
[01:58:10.299 --> 01:58:13.901]  The third and final hour of this July 5, 2005 edition.
[01:58:15.002 --> 01:58:25.027]  And we have coming up the next segment, Joe Bannister, fresh off a big victory against the IRS, former special agent, and his lawyers, Robert Bernhost and Robert Barnes.
[01:58:26.013 --> 01:58:26.674]  So that's coming up.
[01:58:26.694 --> 01:58:33.620]  But I want to play this dark side clip as a tribute to Paul Harvey, who came out and said, hey, slavery helped this country.
[01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:35.582]  Smallpox helped wipe out the Indians.
[01:58:35.602 --> 01:58:41.427]  We've got to get tough like that again and start nuking people, as if you can attack an asymmetrical threat with a nukes.
[01:58:42.633 --> 01:58:44.054]  Just pure evil, folks.
[01:58:44.155 --> 01:58:45.015]  It's just open.
[01:58:45.035 --> 01:58:47.737]  I mean, the Nazis didn't talk like this in public.
[01:58:48.038 --> 01:58:50.720]  So we salute Dark Lord of the Sith for being pure evil.
[01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:52.001]  He definitely wins the prize.
[01:58:52.441 --> 01:58:54.543]  Paul Harvey, someone I admired as a child.
[01:58:54.843 --> 01:58:55.283]  Here it is.
[01:58:55.303 --> 01:58:55.844]  This is for you.
[01:58:58.145 --> 01:59:07.731]  You don't know the power of the dark side.
[01:59:07.791 --> 01:59:14.094]  Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories.
[01:59:14.234 --> 01:59:20.618]  Ensuring the attacks of September the 11th.
[01:59:20.658 --> 01:59:21.779]  The dark side.
[01:59:31.135 --> 01:59:33.256]  The Dark Side.
[01:59:33.516 --> 01:59:37.798]  The Dark Side.
[02:00:18.061 --> 02:00:24.950]  New World Order is run by absolutely ruthless individuals.
[02:00:25.090 --> 02:00:29.596]  Obsessed with total control.
[02:00:30.637 --> 02:00:35.283]  Sworn to the creation of worldwide tyranny.
[02:02:01.620 --> 02:02:04.456]  We're good to go.
[02:02:33.875 --> 02:02:34.636]  All right, folks.
[02:02:35.296 --> 02:02:39.779]  We'll be right back with Joe Bannister as the war against the New World Order continues.
[02:02:39.799 --> 02:02:40.299]  Stay with us.
[02:02:43.861 --> 02:02:44.341]  Hey, folks.
[02:02:44.422 --> 02:02:45.382]  Alex Jones here.
[02:02:45.562 --> 02:02:48.664]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:48.784 --> 02:02:52.687]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:52.727 --> 02:02:56.969]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:02:57.309 --> 02:03:01.092]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:01.232 --> 02:03:03.093]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:03.113 --> 02:03:03.273]  Right.
[02:03:03.633 --> 02:03:06.516]  The riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[02:03:06.576 --> 02:03:11.281]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:11.441 --> 02:03:14.484]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[02:03:14.664 --> 02:03:17.507]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:03:18.028 --> 02:03:24.134]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:24.654 --> 02:03:26.495]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[02:03:43.394 --> 02:03:54.122]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:03:54.302 --> 02:04:01.887]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:04:02.128 --> 02:04:05.290]  Farmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:04:05.430 --> 02:04:05.830]  We're good to go.
[02:04:24.099 --> 02:04:30.063]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[02:04:30.283 --> 02:04:34.546]  Get the Perky Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:34.566 --> 02:04:35.027]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:50.906]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[02:04:51.426 --> 02:04:56.851]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Nonex Nail Gel.
[02:04:57.251 --> 02:05:07.299]  All-natural Nonex is a topical, epinoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[02:05:07.419 --> 02:05:10.221]  Nonex Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[02:05:10.241 --> 02:05:13.124]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost purple.
[02:05:13.644 --> 02:05:14.825]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[02:05:14.945 --> 02:05:22.428]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[02:05:22.689 --> 02:05:24.429]  It's also money-back guarantee.
[02:05:24.750 --> 02:05:36.535]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, and independent pharmacies nationwide, or online at drugstore.com.
[02:05:37.016 --> 02:05:41.358]  Non-X Nail Gel, for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[02:05:45.040 --> 02:05:51.084]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:51.685 --> 02:05:54.727]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:56.188 --> 02:05:56.728]  That's right.
[02:05:56.808 --> 02:06:07.075]  For nine years on talk radio, for 11 on local TV, we've talked about broadcasting, transmitting from behind enemy lines in the information war.
[02:06:07.768 --> 02:06:12.590]  Because ten years ago, the alternative media was a puny, almost unknown commodity.
[02:06:12.650 --> 02:06:20.813]  Now it is gigantic and mammoth and very diverse and actually giving battle to the controlled corporate media.
[02:06:20.973 --> 02:06:23.374]  And so we're no longer behind enemy lines as we were.
[02:06:23.895 --> 02:06:29.697]  We are now on an open battlefront, a contested combat zone, a no-man's land.
[02:06:30.097 --> 02:06:30.797]  We have the truth.
[02:06:30.857 --> 02:06:31.798]  They have the lie.
[02:06:32.218 --> 02:06:34.179]  We are winning, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:06:34.639 --> 02:06:37.300]  More victories than we are suffering defeats.
[02:06:37.958 --> 02:06:47.627]  But the globalists and the organized crime syndicates that control it and own it are turning up the heat and striking back viciously, savagely.
[02:06:49.328 --> 02:07:00.258]  You know, first hour we talk about national talk show hosts from Michael Savage to Rush Limbaugh to now Paul Harvey calling for nuking people and putting people in camps and torture being wonderfuled.
[02:07:01.508 --> 02:07:10.331]  And in the second hour, we talked about CAFTA and the Codex Alimentarius to restrict vitamins and minerals, mainstream vitamins and minerals, over store counters.
[02:07:11.892 --> 02:07:18.914]  We're talking about private property loss with the Supreme Court ruling that they can take your property, and we're looking at the cases without even just compensation.
[02:07:21.115 --> 02:07:26.377]  Just the amount of corruption that we're facing is unbelievable, but the people are becoming aware of it.
[02:07:26.437 --> 02:07:29.618]  Now, for the next 50 minutes, we are honored.
[02:07:30.399 --> 02:07:36.024]  To be joined by a former special agent with the Treasury assigned to the Internal Revenue Service.
[02:07:37.445 --> 02:07:40.388]  Badging a gun, you know, raids on pretty serious people.
[02:07:41.829 --> 02:07:48.254]  And he heard a talk show back in the mid-90s, and the talk show host had a guest on talking about how it was a big scam.
[02:07:48.575 --> 02:07:49.235]  He didn't believe it.
[02:07:49.275 --> 02:07:50.136]  He was going to disprove her.
[02:07:50.862 --> 02:07:51.602]  He was a good guy.
[02:07:51.622 --> 02:07:52.763]  He wasn't involved in a scam.
[02:07:52.803 --> 02:07:53.943]  He found out it was all true.
[02:07:54.023 --> 02:07:56.164]  He said, give me an answer on this or I'll resign.
[02:07:56.544 --> 02:07:57.844]  They said, you should resign.
[02:07:57.884 --> 02:08:00.245]  He wrote a detailed 90-plus page brief for them.
[02:08:00.905 --> 02:08:03.025]  And, of course, he has several different websites.
[02:08:03.566 --> 02:08:04.426]  We'll tell you about those.
[02:08:04.486 --> 02:08:08.107]  And his amazing counselors are joining us.
[02:08:08.567 --> 02:08:12.968]  We have Robert Bernhoff and Robert Barnes conferenced in.
[02:08:13.008 --> 02:08:14.209]  And we have Joe Bannister.
[02:08:14.249 --> 02:08:15.409]  First off, Joe Bannister.
[02:08:16.275 --> 02:08:20.867]  I want, for those that don't know who you are, a small portion of our audience, but still quite large.
[02:08:21.721 --> 02:08:24.903]  Probably hundreds of thousands of people that don't know who you are listening right now.
[02:08:25.363 --> 02:08:32.867]  Tell us who Joe Banister is and your awakening that was so similar to my awakening.
[02:08:33.728 --> 02:08:43.593]  Tell us about that process and then what it led you into and then we'll bring in your amazing champions, Robert Bernhoff and Robert Barnes, your lawyers, your counselors.
[02:08:44.674 --> 02:08:45.614]  Joe, I salute you.
[02:08:45.635 --> 02:08:46.555]  Thanks for being on with us.
[02:08:47.075 --> 02:08:49.857]  Thank you, Alex, and thank you very much for inviting me on.
[02:08:50.872 --> 02:08:56.014]  I know we've known each other for quite a while, since 1999 when I resigned from the IRS.
[02:08:56.954 --> 02:09:00.676]  You came out to California to visit me to see if I was the real deal.
[02:09:02.396 --> 02:09:18.062]  Basically, I worked for the IRS from 1993 through 1999, and my intention, of course, was to spend a full career there in their criminal investigation division, investigating violations of federal income tax and money laundering laws.
[02:09:19.088 --> 02:09:26.651]  And I actually have a family full of public servants, two younger brothers that are police officers and one that's a firefighter.
[02:09:27.451 --> 02:09:32.213]  Government service runs in our family back a couple generations.
[02:09:33.254 --> 02:09:44.618]  And so I started work at the IRS using my financial skills to protect the Treasury, go after cheaters, and expected to live my life doing so.
[02:09:45.836 --> 02:09:57.284]  But as you said, about three years into the five-year stint there, I was listening to a talk radio show by a host who I otherwise thought of as trustworthy and truthful.
[02:09:58.425 --> 02:10:05.770]  He had this woman speaking about the income tax and saying that it was largely a voluntary system.
[02:10:06.130 --> 02:10:14.376]  Given that I carried a gun around in a Sig Sauer 9mm and thought that the income tax was quite mandatory,
[02:10:15.212 --> 02:10:17.733]  And I had the enforcement equipment to prove it.
[02:10:19.494 --> 02:10:21.575]  It was kind of a disconnect for me.
[02:10:21.755 --> 02:10:23.476]  I thought this can't possibly be true.
[02:10:24.997 --> 02:10:28.858]  But the talk show host, as I said, seemed like a good guy.
[02:10:28.998 --> 02:10:35.261]  So I thought either I'm a really bad investigator and I can't read people whatsoever, or there's something to this.
[02:10:36.142 --> 02:10:41.284]  And so I began looking into it and expected at every turn of the page that I would find
[02:10:41.880 --> 02:10:46.825]  The BS, so to speak, finds the holes in this claim.
[02:10:46.965 --> 02:11:04.484]  What I really encountered was more and more evidence that there was some truth to it, that the IRS was basically administering the income tax system beyond what the statutes passed by Congress and the regulations written by the Secretary of the Treasury authorized.
[02:11:05.553 --> 02:11:12.556]  And I didn't want that really to be the result of my analysis, but as far as I could tell, that's what it was.
[02:11:12.576 --> 02:11:19.418]  So when it got to be February of 1999... Now, by the way, you didn't just two days decide.
[02:11:19.438 --> 02:11:21.519]  You spent two years researching, correct?
[02:11:21.899 --> 02:11:26.361]  Yeah, I mean, I'm a father of two boys, married now for nearly 18 years.
[02:11:27.950 --> 02:11:28.491]  I know how it is.
[02:11:46.193 --> 02:12:00.361]  I really dotted my I's, crossed my T's, and did an investigation, just as I would... Well, you wrote a quintessential brief on this, as if you were going to a grand jury, and you brought it to them and said, it's in, what, 90-something pages, please give me an answer on this.
[02:12:00.782 --> 02:12:08.046]  Yes, I thought it was appropriate, and in fact, it said in the procedures that it was quite appropriate to bring these concerns to my supervisors.
[02:12:08.706 --> 02:12:09.467]  And I did that.
[02:12:10.140 --> 02:12:18.845]  And within a few days, I was given a choice, well, basically to go home immediately on administrative leave and think about what I would do for a week.
[02:12:19.705 --> 02:12:26.909]  But I had already told them that if they couldn't address my concerns, that I'd be forced to resign because I couldn't serve two masters.
[02:12:27.690 --> 02:12:37.255]  And I thought that given that the supervisors I submitted my report to took the same oath that I did, had to follow the same procedures that I did,
[02:12:37.862 --> 02:12:43.788]  That somehow I would get some kind of response other than, here's your paperwork to tender your resignation.
[02:12:43.848 --> 02:12:44.389]  See you later.
[02:12:45.069 --> 02:12:46.631]  But that's basically what I got.
[02:12:49.634 --> 02:12:51.235]  I resigned on February 25, 1999.
[02:12:53.297 --> 02:13:01.626]  Since I didn't get my answers from the IRS, even though I worked for them, I continued over the next many years to try to get answers.
[02:13:02.210 --> 02:13:03.471]  Through all kinds of channels.
[02:13:03.831 --> 02:13:11.216]  And now, six years later, there were a whole bunch of full-page ads, front section USA Today, other IRS agents, other people.
[02:13:11.516 --> 02:13:14.038]  For those that don't know, the 16th Amendment, it's official.
[02:13:14.078 --> 02:13:15.919]  We've been to the state agencies.
[02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:18.241]  Never ratified income tax.
[02:13:18.421 --> 02:13:19.542]  A fraud.
[02:13:19.982 --> 02:13:21.383]  Totally unconstitutional.
[02:13:21.463 --> 02:13:22.684]  It's all color of law.
[02:13:23.164 --> 02:13:25.246]  And all of this came out later.
[02:13:25.286 --> 02:13:28.648]  And then in a nutshell, because I want to go to your lawyers who are here, because we've got to be...
[02:13:28.868 --> 02:13:30.189]  In 2001, there was a criminal investigation.
[02:13:30.209 --> 02:13:33.310]  We learned at some point that a criminal investigation was instituted in 2000 or 2001.
[02:13:54.900 --> 02:14:03.868]  In 2003, there was an effort to basically lock me out of the Internal Revenue Service as an advocate, as a CPA.
[02:14:04.489 --> 02:14:10.735]  I'm sure you and your listeners are aware that CPAs and attorneys routinely assist people with IRS matters.
[02:14:11.515 --> 02:14:18.862]  Given that I had quite a bit of experience in that department, I would occasionally assist clients with their IRS matters.
[02:14:19.500 --> 02:14:31.405]  And unlike most CPAs, I was certainly not fearful of the agency, and I could actually point out indications of fraud in their computer systems and what they had done to the client.
[02:14:31.985 --> 02:14:36.447]  And so, of course, they didn't like that, and they also wanted to discredit me in any way they could.
[02:14:36.687 --> 02:14:41.809]  Well, Joe, that's the point that has to be made, that even people who still pay the income tax, which I'm going to say on air, I do.
[02:14:42.469 --> 02:14:44.430]  Because I don't have time to fight this battle.
[02:14:45.130 --> 02:14:49.031]  I know it's a fraud, but even when I do pay it, every year they lost the return.
[02:14:49.131 --> 02:14:50.451]  Every year they're a bunch of idiots.
[02:14:51.051 --> 02:14:51.551]  Every year.
[02:14:51.571 --> 02:14:57.953]  And we hear all these horror stories, but for those that have chosen to take up this fight, they don't play fair.
[02:14:58.233 --> 02:14:59.793]  It's damned if you do, damned if you don't.
[02:15:00.814 --> 02:15:01.174]  I agree.
[02:15:01.374 --> 02:15:05.855]  And yeah, I don't encourage people to take on the IRS one-on-one.
[02:15:06.423 --> 02:15:12.429]  If anything, I discourage it, but I do encourage people to talk to their neighbors, their friends, their coworkers.
[02:15:12.449 --> 02:15:15.333]  But my point is, I'm not safe, though, even though I pay it.
[02:15:15.413 --> 02:15:16.213]  Well, you're right.
[02:15:16.233 --> 02:15:21.139]  I mean, you can't... When you have an agency that is not accountable, no matter what you do...
[02:15:22.240 --> 02:15:23.261]  You have to watch your back.
[02:15:23.622 --> 02:15:25.744]  And we just can't have that in America.
[02:15:25.944 --> 02:15:27.245]  It's unacceptable.
[02:15:27.485 --> 02:15:35.353]  Well, I want to know why every year they lose the return, and then they send me threatening letters saying, and I send them registered letters, get registered stamps back, and they still lose it again.
[02:15:35.373 --> 02:15:36.574]  It's harassment.
[02:15:37.715 --> 02:15:38.276]  Plain and simple.
[02:15:38.999 --> 02:15:41.361]  Well, I mean, it's just unbelievable, folks.
[02:15:42.262 --> 02:15:46.106]  I want to get into all the things you went through and what happened, but I think it's time to bring your lawyers in.
[02:15:46.126 --> 02:15:46.947]  We're about to break.
[02:15:47.408 --> 02:15:48.549]  Or I should call them counselors.
[02:15:48.769 --> 02:15:51.712]  We have Robert Bernhoff and Robert Barnes together.
[02:15:51.772 --> 02:15:53.574]  Gentlemen, thanks for having both of you on.
[02:15:53.594 --> 02:15:54.094]  I appreciate it.
[02:15:54.314 --> 02:15:54.675]  You bet.
[02:15:54.755 --> 02:15:55.556]  Pleasure to be here, Alex.
[02:15:56.334 --> 02:15:56.855]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[02:15:57.255 --> 02:15:58.897]  Okay, and so I recognize the voices.
[02:15:59.117 --> 02:16:00.399]  Mr. Bernhoff, say hi to folks.
[02:16:00.699 --> 02:16:01.840]  Yes, how are you all doing out there?
[02:16:01.860 --> 02:16:03.162]  Hello, Mr. Bernhoff.
[02:16:03.362 --> 02:16:04.043]  Mr. Barnes?
[02:16:04.443 --> 02:16:05.204]  Yes, how are you doing?
[02:16:05.645 --> 02:16:07.867]  Gentlemen, we're about to break, but give us an opening statement.
[02:16:08.227 --> 02:16:09.769]  Yeah, I wanted to say something, Alex.
[02:16:09.789 --> 02:16:12.292]  Your point about appeal is an important one.
[02:16:13.213 --> 02:16:15.656]  In the American system of justice, we have a jury.
[02:16:16.818 --> 02:16:21.681]  Of 12 citizens that finds the defendant not guilty of all charges, that matter is over.
[02:16:21.881 --> 02:16:25.983]  Yeah, that's final, but then if you're convicted, you get the appeal.
[02:16:26.243 --> 02:16:26.863]  That's correct.
[02:16:26.883 --> 02:16:28.844]  The defendant can appeal if there's appealable grounds.
[02:16:29.265 --> 02:16:43.472]  The government can appeal only on very limited grounds, but in this case, a jury of Joe's peers, just average, law-abiding, hard-working citizens who heard the evidence and heard the arguments of the attorneys who argued for the government,
[02:16:44.033 --> 02:16:48.315]  And listen to Jeff Dickstein and I, particularly Jeff Dickstein, in a brilliant closing argument.
[02:16:48.975 --> 02:16:53.237]  They saw through the con, and they acquitted Joe on all counts, and that's not appealable.
[02:16:53.317 --> 02:16:57.639]  So it's just a spectacular outcome.
[02:16:57.659 --> 02:17:02.400]  Well, if they would have won, this would mean that people aren't allowed to have the benefit of counsel.
[02:17:02.981 --> 02:17:05.642]  Well, that's what this is really all about in our view.
[02:17:05.722 --> 02:17:08.503]  What they're trying to do here is criminalize advocacy.
[02:17:09.265 --> 02:17:24.412]  In fact, one of the recent commissioners of IRS was quoted in a national newspaper as saying that, I'm paraphrasing, tax practitioners should be the pillars of our system of voluntary compliance, not the architects of its diversion.
[02:17:25.152 --> 02:17:29.414]  And let me tell you something, I don't have a duty to the IRS.
[02:17:29.554 --> 02:17:33.196]  As a lawyer, as a counselor, my duty is to my client.
[02:17:34.186 --> 02:17:36.769]  And I have no obligation whatsoever to... Well, stay there.
[02:17:36.829 --> 02:17:37.409]  Stay there, gentlemen.
[02:17:37.429 --> 02:17:37.830]  We've got a break.
[02:17:37.850 --> 02:17:41.874]  We'll come back and talk about this, because that's why they went after Joe, was because he was counseling people.
[02:17:41.894 --> 02:17:43.575]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:44.176 --> 02:17:47.799]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[02:17:48.120 --> 02:17:51.643]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[02:17:51.923 --> 02:17:54.926]  Midas Resources, a team of hand-picked financial specialists...
[02:17:55.998 --> 02:17:56.358]  We're good to go.
[02:18:11.069 --> 02:18:16.051]  And remember, if you read the Midas Report, you'll receive a free Walking Liberty Silver Half Dollar.
[02:18:45.689 --> 02:18:46.730]  The war on terrorism.
[02:18:47.050 --> 02:18:49.853]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:18:50.113 --> 02:18:54.257]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:18:54.697 --> 02:18:55.518]  So what do you do?
[02:18:55.839 --> 02:19:00.403]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:19:00.883 --> 02:19:03.025]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:19:03.505 --> 02:19:18.215]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[02:19:47.378 --> 02:19:54.022]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[02:19:55.203 --> 02:19:57.485]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[02:19:58.305 --> 02:20:04.490]  These laws will eventually shut down Christianity in America by accusing Christians of hate crimes.
[02:20:05.439 --> 02:20:05.659]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:05.679 --> 02:20:06.100]  That's 1-800-516-8736.

[02:20:37.536 --> 02:20:38.157]  Call now.

[02:21:31.676 --> 02:21:33.097]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:33.137 --> 02:21:35.318]  Got a lot of ground to cover in three segments to do it.
[02:21:59.827 --> 02:22:08.981]  We may take three or four calls, quick questions, at around 45 after or so, 1-800-259-9231, but they've got to be quick questions.
[02:22:09.602 --> 02:22:13.307]  Don't have a lot of time here today with these three very busy men, valiant men at that.
[02:22:14.429 --> 02:22:15.491]  Champions for all of us.
[02:22:16.475 --> 02:22:20.177]  But we have the National Bar Association coming out and arguing against having juries.
[02:22:20.758 --> 02:22:27.181]  We have in federal cases where the feds will say, Judge Walter Smith in the second Waco case, a civil case, said, I'm not going to allow a jury.
[02:22:28.102 --> 02:22:33.044]  We have under the Patriot Act, they want to charge lawyers for giving people a defense.
[02:22:34.225 --> 02:22:34.865]  And they've done it.
[02:22:35.786 --> 02:22:37.347]  Even in non-terror related cases.
[02:22:38.368 --> 02:22:41.731]  Folks, we're at the 11th hour right now here.
[02:22:41.751 --> 02:22:48.896]  I was talking to Mr. Bernhoff and Mr. Barnes during the break, and you made some really good points, Mr. Bernhoff, during the break.
[02:22:49.156 --> 02:22:49.937]  Please repeat those.
[02:22:50.337 --> 02:22:58.063]  Well, yeah, Alex, we were talking about this issue that in some perverse way, the IRS is worse than American organized crime.
[02:22:58.964 --> 02:23:08.111]  At least with American organized crime, you pay the 10% so they don't blow up the bakery, and with the IRS, you pay 20% or 30%, and they keep coming looking for more.
[02:23:08.652 --> 02:23:10.215]  This system of collection of this individual income tax
[02:23:20.729 --> 02:23:23.890]  is frankly a walking due process violation.
[02:23:24.430 --> 02:23:29.152]  It's anathema to basic American principles of ordered liberty.
[02:23:29.212 --> 02:23:32.173]  I mean, even Money Magazine admits it's designed to entrap you.
[02:23:32.233 --> 02:23:35.034]  It's designed so you can't comply, even though the things are fraud.
[02:23:35.394 --> 02:23:39.616]  And you had mentioned, too, Alex, about going after attorneys under the Patriot Act.
[02:23:40.436 --> 02:23:46.498]  The Treasury Department IRS has ratcheted up staffing and the authority of their director of practice.
[02:23:47.162 --> 02:24:09.862]  And they have an agenda, and they're going to be going out there trying to attack tax professionals like tax counselors and CPAs, who frankly are aggressive in their advocacy for their clients, who understand that their first duty is to their clients, and that the IRS is not a court or a body that practitioners owe any duty to whatsoever.
[02:24:09.902 --> 02:24:12.405]  Yeah, they create these really fraudulent courts.
[02:24:12.850 --> 02:24:14.871]  Well, this is, you know, Assistant U.S.
[02:24:14.911 --> 02:24:21.193]  Attorney Robert Twist actually argued in his closing argument that somehow Joe Bannister had a duty to the IRS.
[02:24:21.273 --> 02:24:23.334]  We were absolutely stunned by that.
[02:24:24.275 --> 02:24:27.136]  There is no duty that a tax practitioner has to the IRS.
[02:24:27.336 --> 02:24:29.517]  Our duty is to our clients.
[02:24:29.597 --> 02:24:38.521]  So now, I mean, that sounds like an inservitude to say a whole class of professionals, degreed CPAs, and also law enforcement specialists like Joseph Bannister has to do this.
[02:24:38.801 --> 02:24:41.002]  This is particularly pernicious, Alex.
[02:24:41.122 --> 02:24:41.962]  Alex, I'll tell you why.
[02:24:42.441 --> 02:24:46.505]  Just imagine, you know, we've got personal injury lawyers and then we've got insurance defense lawyers.
[02:24:46.925 --> 02:24:56.273]  Personal injury lawyers defend people and file plaintiff suits for people that have been injured, generally against corporations, and what we call insurance defense attorneys will come in and defend.
[02:24:56.773 --> 02:25:04.320]  And just imagine if the plaintiff's bar were able to regulate the defense bar in personal injury litigation.
[02:25:04.787 --> 02:25:06.788]  And charge them with unethical conduct.
[02:25:06.848 --> 02:25:16.134]  Yeah, hang that chilling effect over them with... Now, we're talking about the executive and the government, the prosecutors, having regulatory control over the defense.
[02:25:16.415 --> 02:25:16.835]  That's correct.
[02:25:16.855 --> 02:25:23.679]  You've got this extremely powerful administrative agency that is adversarial to every single American.
[02:25:24.320 --> 02:25:32.405]  The IRS takes the position that everybody cheats on their taxes, they want more money from American citizens, and the IRS says, we can regulate...
[02:25:33.152 --> 02:25:37.313]  The professionals that defend citizens against the IRS.
[02:25:37.333 --> 02:25:40.694]  So we're talking about Napoleonic or Roman law, guilty until proven innocent.
[02:25:41.495 --> 02:25:46.036]  Mr. Barnes, another counselor, I want to a little bit get into the trial here.
[02:25:46.056 --> 02:25:48.637]  I mean, you guys won because it did go to a jury.
[02:25:48.917 --> 02:25:51.338]  How did you get it out of their kangaroo court into a real court?
[02:25:51.798 --> 02:25:59.742]  Well, fortunately, the one thing, you know, certain constitutional rights have not yet gone away, however much certain people in power or certain politicians may wish they were not there.
[02:26:00.142 --> 02:26:07.445]  And one of the true restraints left on the power of the United States government is the right to a jury trial in a matter of a criminal accusation.
[02:26:07.995 --> 02:26:10.397]  And so that was one thing they could not avoid or get around.
[02:26:11.078 --> 02:26:23.828]  They could get around Joe getting an opportunity to speak to the grand jury and things like that by not giving him an opportunity to do so, but what they could not do is avoid 12 ordinary Americans stepping into that bench and making a decision when they saw the evidence.
[02:26:24.148 --> 02:26:30.013]  And they were, of course, for those that don't know specifically, what did they falsely allege against Agent Bannister?
[02:26:30.393 --> 02:26:32.395]  They alleged two sets of allegations.
[02:26:32.555 --> 02:26:41.181]  One was a criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States government in his various statements and representations that he had made along with someone else, Mr. Al Thompson.
[02:26:41.642 --> 02:26:46.045]  And in the three returns that he had filed, they said were false and fraudulent returns.
[02:26:46.685 --> 02:26:59.135]  Even though Joe had disclosed the exact basis of it, exactly what he was arguing for, had used the exact procedures and protocols the IRS itself had recommended in such cases and that their own people testified to as being appropriate on the stand.
[02:26:59.930 --> 02:27:12.518]  But that was the allegation, that he had filed false and fraudulent returns because the government's view, basically, is that if you file a return that the government doesn't agree with, that is now false and fraudulent, not protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution or advocacy under the rights to counsel.
[02:27:12.538 --> 02:27:27.028]  All right, we've got a break again, but I want to come back and talk about this defense and how you got around the judge trying to crush any of these arguments, bringing forward their own case law, their own statements, their own literature and guidelines to defeat them.
[02:27:27.870 --> 02:27:29.212]  We'll bring Joe in as well.
[02:27:29.332 --> 02:27:30.554]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:27:30.574 --> 02:27:32.917]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:34.439 --> 02:27:35.380]  We're on the march.
[02:27:35.841 --> 02:27:37.423]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:37.443 --> 02:27:41.048]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:28:43.700 --> 02:28:51.166]  This is Wendy Malek from Just Shoot Me, here to tell you about Pets 911, a free public service changing the way we care for pets in every community nationwide.
[02:28:51.306 --> 02:28:55.489]  Across the country, there are thousands of healthy, adoptable pets waiting for a loving home every day.

[02:29:44.221 --> 02:29:47.983]  For a while now, you've been hearing about energized water and what it can do for your health.
[02:29:48.224 --> 02:29:51.686]  But have you taken the next step and actually experienced energized water?
[02:29:51.966 --> 02:29:56.809]  It's absolutely incredible what you'll experience while using the energized products from Aqua Northwest.
[02:29:57.089 --> 02:30:01.372]  You've seen the banner on GCNlive.com, but have you experienced the power of the pyramid?
[02:30:01.572 --> 02:30:04.734]  We all know that negative energy can make you sick at home or in the office.
[02:30:04.894 --> 02:30:09.177]  But the energy pyramid from Aqua Northwest wipes out that negative energy within a 125-foot diameter.
[02:30:10.638 --> 02:30:11.419]  We're good to go.
[02:30:11.459 --> 02:30:11.839]  We're good to go.
[02:30:44.339 --> 02:30:55.323]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:30:55.683 --> 02:30:58.865]  Blasting out on the AM and FM dial from Los Angeles, California.
[02:30:59.945 --> 02:31:01.746]  Kansas City, Missouri from Austin, Texas.
[02:31:02.246 --> 02:31:05.227]  Pensacola, Florida to Niagara Falls and upstate New York.
[02:31:06.445 --> 02:31:16.296]  Sam will cast it on Global Shortwave during the day at 9.985, 3rd hour 9.975, and at night 3210, and on the web at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:31:18.218 --> 02:31:23.684]  Now, folks, we're talking to Joe Bannister, and he went public back in 99 about the fraud that is the IRS.
[02:31:23.865 --> 02:31:25.727]  We're not saying there aren't taxes we should pay.
[02:31:26.431 --> 02:31:28.832]  But those are constitutional taxes, not the income tax.
[02:31:29.292 --> 02:31:31.013]  They're not advising you to not file it.
[02:31:31.193 --> 02:31:33.734]  It's just you need to know this fraud for what it is.
[02:31:33.834 --> 02:31:35.035]  And, folks, it really is a fraud.
[02:31:35.515 --> 02:31:36.796]  The 16th Amendment is a fraud.
[02:31:37.796 --> 02:31:39.877]  And we've gone over this at nausea, and most of you know this.
[02:31:39.897 --> 02:31:41.137]  We're not really even getting into that today.
[02:31:41.158 --> 02:31:53.443]  We're talking about then the criminality and the violations of due process and the Bill of Rights and common law and every canon of a free society from the Magna Carta back to the roots of that common law on Mount Sinai.
[02:31:54.941 --> 02:31:56.201]  That's all being violated.
[02:31:56.421 --> 02:31:58.542]  And you see all the cases of this every day.
[02:32:00.042 --> 02:32:12.045]  And they wouldn't be trying to frustrate and outlaw a defense and outlaw advice by counselors and lawyers and CPAs if they didn't have something to hide and if they weren't worried.
[02:32:12.205 --> 02:32:18.247]  And if so many people formerly with their system weren't defecting as they learned the truth.
[02:32:19.099 --> 02:32:20.860]  People always say a fraud can't stand.
[02:32:20.900 --> 02:32:21.541]  It'll be exposed.
[02:32:21.561 --> 02:32:22.962]  Well, this has been exposed.
[02:32:23.002 --> 02:32:26.384]  People are defecting, so now they're trying to use an iron fist.
[02:32:27.625 --> 02:32:29.306]  They've taken the gloves off to enforce this.
[02:32:29.326 --> 02:32:39.353]  We're talking to Joe Bannister's lawyers, and we're talking to Robert Bernhoff and Robert Barnes, and we have Joe on with us as well.
[02:32:39.894 --> 02:32:48.620]  So specifically, they're alleging that Joe Bannister's preparing bad tax returns, but
[02:32:49.878 --> 02:32:54.141]  I want to know, gentlemen, and Joseph Bannister, how were you able to even put on a defense?
[02:32:54.161 --> 02:33:05.008]  Because so many things I've looked at in other cases, looking at other cases, the judges will not allow evidence to be brought up and try to deceive the jury.
[02:33:05.488 --> 02:33:15.494]  I would imagine that they may have done that here and it backfired on them, or instead of speculating, please tell me, all of you, and just free for all, jump in, what really happened?
[02:33:16.155 --> 02:33:19.437]  Alex, I'll touch on that, and then I'm just going to pass it over to Joe and Bob Barnes.
[02:33:20.583 --> 02:33:21.544]  I'll tell you something.
[02:33:23.725 --> 02:33:26.906]  Judge Shubb in the U.S.
[02:33:26.946 --> 02:33:30.588]  District Court, Eastern District Sacramento, gave us a fair trial.
[02:33:32.209 --> 02:33:41.654]  I think part of that was because he recognized that Jeff Dickstein, who bar none is the finest federal criminal tax defense attorney in the country, we knew the law.
[02:33:42.513 --> 02:33:45.354]  We conducted ourselves with professionalism and collegiality.
[02:33:46.095 --> 02:33:50.676]  We were extremely aggressive advocates, but I think there was some mutual respect that occurred there.
[02:33:51.357 --> 02:33:53.618]  And Judge Shubb gave us a fair trial.
[02:33:54.398 --> 02:34:03.622]  Obviously, I disagreed with a couple of his evidentiary rulings, but he did not prevent Jeff Dickstein and I from working, what lawyers call working.
[02:34:04.442 --> 02:34:09.044]  We were able to object to what we needed to, to cross-examine the government's witnesses,
[02:34:10.165 --> 02:34:14.368]  He allowed us to argue on the Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal.
[02:34:15.068 --> 02:34:16.769]  And we got a fair trial.
[02:34:17.230 --> 02:34:23.694]  And, you know, I was involved in the Verney Coogland acquittals that FedEx capped in Memphis, Tennessee in August 2003.
[02:34:24.354 --> 02:34:26.315]  I co-counseled that case with Larry Becraft.
[02:34:26.816 --> 02:34:30.178]  And Judge McCall down there in Memphis, you know, also gave us a fair trial.
[02:34:30.678 --> 02:34:38.423]  Now, that is not to say that there are some of these political dissenting defendants who are not getting a fair trial.
[02:34:38.959 --> 02:34:42.022]  But we got one, and I'd like to turn it over to Joe and get his thought.
[02:34:42.222 --> 02:34:42.502]  Yes.
[02:34:43.783 --> 02:34:57.356]  Yeah, I mean, from my little chair there at the defense table, what I saw was the government parading my conduct in the form of a videotape that I had freely appeared on back in the year 2000.
[02:34:58.297 --> 02:35:01.680]  We had a meeting with the employees of Sal Thompson's,
[02:35:02.487 --> 02:35:05.469]  And they asked me, Joe, do you mind if we videotape this?
[02:35:05.569 --> 02:35:06.889]  I said, no, not at all.
[02:35:07.630 --> 02:35:12.032]  Joe, do you mind if we have a New York Times reporter here to view this?
[02:35:12.112 --> 02:35:13.152]  I said, no, not at all.
[02:35:13.212 --> 02:35:24.718]  Because, of course, from my perspective, I was simply telling these employees about my story, about what had happened to me, and how difficult it is when you see that the IRS doesn't appear to be following the rule book.
[02:35:25.398 --> 02:35:31.441]  Well, I also had a great deal of paperwork that involved my advocacy for Al Thompson.
[02:35:32.268 --> 02:35:43.616]  And the government, that was basically their case, was to show the jury the evidence that they got from me through grand jury subpoenas and through their special agent investigators.
[02:35:44.396 --> 02:35:50.020]  And the jury, a couple of them who I spoke with after the trial, said they couldn't understand.
[02:35:50.080 --> 02:35:54.863]  Every time they looked at one of these exhibits and saw that it was a government exhibit, said,
[02:35:55.629 --> 02:36:03.711]  Why is it that the government is giving us all these exhibits that show Joe Bannister to be nothing but an upright, honest, and open advocate?
[02:36:04.371 --> 02:36:09.692]  And I told them after the trial that, well, as far as I can tell, it's because they didn't have anything else.
[02:36:09.972 --> 02:36:16.954]  And they somehow wanted to convince the jury that my advocacy, even my aggressive advocacy, was somehow criminal.
[02:36:17.714 --> 02:36:22.715]  And these 12 jurors, who had very thinking people, great Americans,
[02:36:24.849 --> 02:36:29.152]  Let me ask you a question, Joe.
[02:36:29.312 --> 02:36:30.513]  Was this even close?
[02:36:30.553 --> 02:36:38.838]  I mean, did you later find out the different machinations of the jury, or was it pretty much plain from the start?
[02:36:39.419 --> 02:36:40.499]  And that's for all three of you.
[02:36:41.060 --> 02:36:50.306]  It wasn't even close, and I based that on a statement from one of the jurors, who I won't identify by name, but I just spoke with that juror again a couple days ago.
[02:36:51.058 --> 02:36:58.360]  And they told me that never was there a vote taken, you know, a preliminary vote in which any juror voted for guilt.
[02:36:58.900 --> 02:37:01.760]  Let me ask you a question to your counselors as well.
[02:37:03.321 --> 02:37:05.241]  Skipping ahead to the end, what happened?
[02:37:05.281 --> 02:37:17.023]  I mean, was there palpable anger by the prosecution or were they ashamed of themselves from the start and did they, you know, basically show good sportsmanship or what happened?
[02:37:17.464 --> 02:37:19.444]  I'm going to take that one, Bob.
[02:37:19.504 --> 02:37:19.664]  It was
[02:37:20.339 --> 02:37:21.960]  It was a very interesting trial.
[02:37:22.421 --> 02:37:30.887]  As Joe mentioned in one of his email updates recently, when the indictment was first unsealed, and they actually arrested Joe at his home, which was completely unnecessary.
[02:37:30.987 --> 02:37:31.627]  Oh, yeah.
[02:37:31.647 --> 02:37:32.228]  Talk about that, too.
[02:37:32.288 --> 02:37:33.068]  I'm sorry.
[02:37:33.328 --> 02:37:33.809]  Yeah.
[02:37:33.829 --> 02:37:35.830]  They sent two special agents out to arrest him.
[02:37:36.230 --> 02:37:39.433]  They treated him professionally, but that was outrageous.
[02:37:39.873 --> 02:37:41.214]  That was completely unnecessary.
[02:37:41.254 --> 02:37:42.655]  Did they arrest him in front of his family?
[02:37:42.855 --> 02:37:45.077]  Well, unfortunately, his family wasn't there.
[02:37:45.197 --> 02:37:46.658]  Oh, good.
[02:37:46.818 --> 02:37:48.119]  And, of course, the U.S.
[02:37:48.159 --> 02:37:49.760]  attorney from Sacramento...
[02:37:50.350 --> 02:38:00.235]  And Commissioner Everson and all of these powerful public officials made statements declaring Joe Bannister guilty when the indictment was unsealed and he was arrested.
[02:38:00.915 --> 02:38:04.817]  And the courtroom was packed on the government side of the aisle every day of trial.
[02:38:04.837 --> 02:38:06.338]  Oh, couldn't that be a civil matter?
[02:38:06.358 --> 02:38:10.760]  It could be, and we're evaluating all of Joe's legal options about that.
[02:38:11.120 --> 02:38:15.963]  But when you're talking, Alex, about whether the government was real rabid in this prosecution...
[02:38:16.587 --> 02:38:17.488]  They were just arrogant.
[02:38:17.908 --> 02:38:19.510]  And they were very arrogant.
[02:38:19.550 --> 02:38:21.171]  They thought they had this cat in the bag.
[02:38:21.312 --> 02:38:22.433]  Would you call it humorous?
[02:38:23.073 --> 02:38:23.454]  I would.
[02:38:23.614 --> 02:38:27.317]  And I would call it... There was a lot of stupidity going on there as well.
[02:38:27.758 --> 02:38:33.583]  But it bears noting that when we got a note that the jury verdict was in Thursday afternoon at about 2 or 5 p.m.,
[02:38:34.656 --> 02:38:35.656]  We went into the courtroom.
[02:38:35.816 --> 02:38:37.657]  We were waiting for the two assistant U.S.
[02:38:37.697 --> 02:38:38.057]  attorneys.
[02:38:38.117 --> 02:38:39.358]  Yeah, that's a basic question.
[02:38:39.578 --> 02:38:40.778]  How long was the jury out?
[02:38:41.178 --> 02:38:43.819]  The jury was out approximately two full days.
[02:38:44.079 --> 02:38:44.739]  Okay.
[02:38:45.059 --> 02:38:50.321]  And so when we knew that the verdict was coming in, we went into the courtroom, and there was two assistant U.S.
[02:38:50.361 --> 02:38:52.322]  attorneys, Robert Twist and Carolyn Delaney.
[02:38:53.182 --> 02:38:55.803]  And the judge's clerk had to call down and find out where they were.
[02:38:56.303 --> 02:39:00.784]  And finally, Robert Twist showed up, and Carolyn Delaney did not even show up for the reading of the verdict.
[02:39:01.245 --> 02:39:02.385]  And stunningly,
[02:39:03.021 --> 02:39:10.665]  The government side of the courtroom was absolutely empty in contrast to it being packed for the entire trial.
[02:39:10.685 --> 02:39:12.586]  Do you think they were surveilling the jury?
[02:39:13.466 --> 02:39:16.487]  No, I think they were stunned that they had no case.
[02:39:16.507 --> 02:39:20.869]  They were absolutely stunned by Jeff Dickstein's closing argument.
[02:39:20.889 --> 02:39:22.750]  So they had read the jury and thought they lost?
[02:39:23.050 --> 02:39:23.411]  You bet.
[02:39:23.711 --> 02:39:24.691]  That's absolutely correct.
[02:39:25.051 --> 02:39:32.735]  And when you talk about sportsmanship, you know, I tried to go over to Mr. Twist and shake his hand, and he just looked at me and turned and walked out of the courtroom.
[02:39:33.154 --> 02:39:34.135]  But I will say something.
[02:39:34.155 --> 02:39:44.100]  The two special agents that investigated Joe in this case, Special Agents Paul Howard and Sean Breslin, and Joe can pipe in on this as well, I'll just make a comment.
[02:39:44.640 --> 02:39:52.224]  I went over to Sean Breslin, he shook my hand, I shook Paul Howard's hand, and Joe, why don't you give some observations about particularly Sean Breslin?
[02:39:52.405 --> 02:39:54.686]  Well, yeah, let me throw a caveat in on this, because...
[02:39:55.945 --> 02:39:57.285]  This is going to send shockwaves.
[02:39:57.305 --> 02:40:07.887]  I mean, they're losing a lot of cases now, but it's got to send shockwaves when these agents are probably going to go research what Joe is saying now, and this could really clean things up.
[02:40:07.927 --> 02:40:09.148]  Go ahead and comment on it.
[02:40:09.428 --> 02:40:22.050]  Well, I was told, and this is just what I was told by an observer who had observed the whole trial, that they thought they saw some tears in Sean Breslin's eyes, because, of course, I worked with Sean and Paul,
[02:40:22.782 --> 02:40:26.785]  And anyway, after the trial, I went over, they were there, and I went over and shook their hands.
[02:40:26.885 --> 02:40:29.406]  Mr. Twist, the prosecutor, was nowhere to be seen.
[02:40:30.167 --> 02:40:33.068]  But I shook their hands and I said, stay safe out there, guys.
[02:40:33.669 --> 02:40:40.613]  Meaning, you know, there's still this law enforcement capacity, even if perhaps in our opinion they're not doing what they should be doing.
[02:40:41.513 --> 02:40:48.898]  I truly want them to be safe, and I want law enforcement people like my family to be safe and not be these pawns that are used by
[02:40:49.474 --> 02:40:50.355]  We're good to go.
[02:40:50.375 --> 02:40:51.077]  I think?
[02:40:57.924 --> 02:41:03.988]  So I do want them to be safe, but I do want them to educate themselves as to what the limitations are.
[02:41:04.168 --> 02:41:05.569]  Well, let's be clear about this.
[02:41:06.249 --> 02:41:16.315]  The income tax is a fraud and a scam, but you're going to have nasty criminals involved in some situations that are still dangerous, that are still then breaking other laws.
[02:41:16.595 --> 02:41:17.336]  Absolutely.
[02:41:17.396 --> 02:41:18.396]  There's a need.
[02:41:18.496 --> 02:41:22.579]  None of us, my counsel or myself, have not abandoned the thought that
[02:41:23.075 --> 02:41:24.336]  We absolutely need government.
[02:41:24.476 --> 02:41:26.417]  We need taxes.
[02:41:26.517 --> 02:41:27.638]  We need enforcers.
[02:41:28.399 --> 02:41:30.940]  But we need them to be respected by the public.
[02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:42.608]  And the best way to gain respect of the public is that the public knows that you're not operating under color of law and that you respect their rights and that you can still do your business within those parameters.
[02:41:42.628 --> 02:41:47.631]  Well, Joe, just in a nutshell for those that don't understand this fraud, let's say you have 60 seconds on 2020.
[02:41:49.652 --> 02:41:50.753]  What is the income tax?
[02:41:50.813 --> 02:41:51.694]  What is the IRS?
[02:41:53.255 --> 02:42:03.319]  Well, the income tax laws, there have been numerous laws and regulations passed by Congress and the Secretary of the Treasury that do have the force of law.
[02:42:04.019 --> 02:42:09.661]  They do apply to people, and then there's other people that they don't apply to.
[02:42:10.401 --> 02:42:18.984]  And the IRS as an agency is largely staffed with people that have never read the Internal Revenue Code or the Code of Federal Regulations.
[02:42:19.483 --> 02:42:24.186]  Basically, is it that this was written up so select corporations could not pay taxes?
[02:42:24.647 --> 02:42:29.510]  Because I see a New York Times article today about all these richest people in the world not even paying taxes.
[02:42:30.431 --> 02:42:37.575]  Well, I think they're using other loopholes that maybe have been put into the law purposely by the Congress.
[02:42:38.556 --> 02:42:48.583]  But in terms of the application of the tax, as I understand it, when it came into being in the early 1900s, it was meant to tax things like interest, dividends,
[02:42:49.353 --> 02:42:50.894]  Gains on stock sales.
[02:42:51.134 --> 02:42:52.255]  A capital gain.
[02:42:52.295 --> 02:42:52.555]  True.
[02:42:52.615 --> 02:42:58.198]  Any kind of gain or accession to wealth, that was what income was in a constitutional sense.
[02:42:58.338 --> 02:42:58.978]  Not labor.
[02:42:59.459 --> 02:42:59.839]  Correct.
[02:42:59.899 --> 02:43:13.927]  And so over the years, just through the apathy of the public and their lack of understanding of these issues, the IRS has just kind of walked all over the Constitution in terms of, as Bob said, due process rights and things like that.
[02:43:14.587 --> 02:43:17.889]  Bottom line is they absolutely do have authority in certain areas
[02:43:18.345 --> 02:43:21.328]  But their own employees don't know what those limitations are.
[02:43:21.348 --> 02:43:26.473]  Well, what about when I see the reports where, you know, 20-something percent of the Senate doesn't pay income taxes?
[02:43:26.633 --> 02:43:28.455]  I mean, we see those reports.
[02:43:29.036 --> 02:43:36.203]  Well, there's certainly people, even people within the IRS, there's a large percentage of employees that have tax problems that don't,
[02:43:36.724 --> 02:43:37.344]  Thank you very much.
[02:43:51.809 --> 02:44:01.918]  Well, I'll tell you, this is a beautiful story, though, because it's the trials and tribulations of a person of conscience who researched what was happening, and these men that helped you, Mr. Bernhoff and Barnes and others.
[02:44:01.958 --> 02:44:07.683]  But, Bernhoff, Barnes, gentlemen, just any other key points before we take a few calls that you want to make for the listeners?
[02:44:07.924 --> 02:44:08.684]  Sure.
[02:44:09.004 --> 02:44:16.131]  Well, the amazing thing is the media coverage, and you talked about how this case proceeded, and one of my ground theories about it is that when you're so used to lying and saying things,
[02:44:16.621 --> 02:44:18.142]  Blue is green and yellow is red.
[02:44:19.062 --> 02:44:21.844]  Sometimes you're shocked when you find 12 people who disagree with you.
[02:44:21.864 --> 02:44:26.726]  And until Jeff Dickstein's closing argument, I don't think they realized that their own lies were not true.
[02:44:26.986 --> 02:44:28.387]  Tell us about that closing argument.
[02:44:28.887 --> 02:44:30.488]  Yeah, Terry Dickstein got up.
[02:44:31.248 --> 02:44:37.972]  Terry Twist had said, you know, nobody's disputing Joe's character, but he couldn't remember exactly which compliments different people had given of Joe's character.
[02:44:38.352 --> 02:44:39.773]  So Jeff got up and started with that.
[02:44:40.253 --> 02:44:42.294]  But his whole theme was which side is the con on.
[02:44:42.808 --> 02:44:46.010]  And there's been some misrepresentations in the media as to what transpired.
[02:44:46.050 --> 02:44:52.813]  For example, David K. Johnston, who is not at the trial, has reported second-hand information that is false about what took place at the trial.
[02:44:52.993 --> 02:44:55.955]  So basically he said, in your guts, you know this is a fraud.
[02:44:56.215 --> 02:44:56.975]  Go with your guts.
[02:44:57.295 --> 02:44:57.615]  Exactly.
[02:44:57.635 --> 02:45:00.477]  He said, look, this is about speech, this is about America, this is about...
[02:45:02.738 --> 02:45:19.029]  Well, that sounds like jury nullification, where we judge the facts and the law, and, you know, it's like saying there's a law that black people are slaves, but I'm going to load them on the Underground Railroad and save them.
[02:45:19.509 --> 02:45:21.210]  I mean, are you going to put that person in jail?
[02:45:21.370 --> 02:45:22.911]  I can hear you on that.
[02:45:22.951 --> 02:45:28.555]  You know, in speaking to the jurors, and Joe and Bob and I all spoke to the jurors,
[02:45:29.133 --> 02:45:35.895]  It was very clear to us that Jeff Dickstein's closing argument was simply to expose the reason for this prosecution.
[02:45:35.955 --> 02:45:37.776]  In fact, there was an email.
[02:45:38.136 --> 02:45:52.140]  The defense only introduced one exhibit, and it happened to be a document that the government had to give us by virtue of discovery rules when they called a former DOJ tax division attorney named Tom DeLeonardo to the stand.
[02:45:52.180 --> 02:45:53.281]  He's now an assistant U.S.
[02:45:53.341 --> 02:45:54.601]  attorney in New Jersey.
[02:45:55.160 --> 02:46:01.623]  And he had sent an email to Ron Cimino, Western Section Chief DOJ Tax Enforcement, saying, look, Bannister's out there.
[02:46:01.643 --> 02:46:02.564]  He's got this report.
[02:46:03.084 --> 02:46:06.866]  If his motives are really noble and pure, let's sit down with this guy.
[02:46:07.186 --> 02:46:10.227]  Let's tell him where he's wrong, and I think he'll listen.
[02:46:10.707 --> 02:46:21.312]  And so they introduced that there, and D. Leonardo in his email said, you know, this is important because Bannister is one of the most well-known and public leaders of this illegal tax protest movement.
[02:46:21.853 --> 02:46:24.454]  This prosecution should have never happened.
[02:46:25.043 --> 02:46:30.410]  I do not know who was minding the policy ship over there in the Beltway in D.C.
[02:46:30.470 --> 02:46:32.472]  Well, obviously somebody said get Bannister.
[02:46:32.692 --> 02:46:33.353]  You bet they did.
[02:46:33.734 --> 02:46:43.466]  You bet they did because they couldn't have a former Criminal Investigation Division special agent running around committing flagrant acts of First Amendment protected political speech.
[02:46:44.119 --> 02:46:45.281]  Critical of the agency.
[02:46:45.401 --> 02:46:48.885]  But now they've catapulted Joe into the stratosphere.
[02:46:49.105 --> 02:46:49.786]  Yes, they have.
[02:46:50.106 --> 02:46:56.134]  And, of course, many times when government overreaches, there's a backlash and there are some unintended consequences.
[02:46:56.950 --> 02:47:00.591]  But this prosecution was particularly outrageous to me.
[02:47:00.691 --> 02:47:03.732]  I was personally and professionally outraged by it.
[02:47:03.872 --> 02:47:07.953]  Well, Joe, are you thinking you're going to now get some retribution because of this?
[02:47:09.173 --> 02:47:11.153]  I want the truth to get out there, Alex.
[02:47:11.473 --> 02:47:17.775]  Certainly, I talked to my attorneys about whatever we can do to keep the government within its lawful authority.
[02:47:18.275 --> 02:47:18.956]  I'm fine with.
[02:47:19.136 --> 02:47:27.581]  So whatever is done towards that end... Well, I think you've got a civil case and people are shooting their mouths off saying you were guilty beforehand.
[02:47:29.002 --> 02:47:30.543]  Well, you know, then they should know better.
[02:47:30.683 --> 02:47:32.404]  And maybe we'll look into that.
[02:47:32.944 --> 02:47:34.906]  Alex, real quick, I wanted to touch back on the jury.
[02:47:34.926 --> 02:47:35.646]  It was very clear.
[02:47:35.706 --> 02:47:37.207]  I got off on a tangent there.
[02:47:37.227 --> 02:47:38.108]  I apologize for that.
[02:47:38.948 --> 02:47:43.451]  It was very clear that the jury actually weighed the evidence very, very carefully.
[02:47:43.851 --> 02:47:46.393]  They took seriously the jury instructions that
[02:47:46.946 --> 02:48:00.315]  Jeff Dixby and I had a lot to do with crafting, and they listened to the instructions on the law that the judge gave them on willfulness, on what it means to have intent to violate a criminal statute.
[02:48:00.335 --> 02:48:03.657]  You've got to have the intent to be a criminal, and he had the intent to expose fraud.
[02:48:03.757 --> 02:48:06.819]  That's right, and it was very clear to us that the jury actually...
[02:48:07.433 --> 02:48:18.736]  Well, the people that should have been arrested are the people pushing things that don't exist and official oppression and racketeering and fraud.
[02:48:18.756 --> 02:48:24.758]  I mean, I think the people that should have been arrested are those that are on the other side.
[02:48:24.818 --> 02:48:25.578]  Gentlemen, comments?
[02:48:26.358 --> 02:48:32.940]  Well, I think that's what Jeff Dickstein's closing argument was, which side is the con on, and since they acquitted Joe Bannister, that only leaves one side guilty.
[02:48:33.803 --> 02:48:34.985]  Yeah, we found out who was guilty.
[02:48:35.025 --> 02:48:36.167]  Gentlemen, final segment.
[02:48:36.187 --> 02:48:40.875]  We'll talk to David in Phoenix, Mike in Connecticut, Delilah in Ohio, and wrap this up.
[02:48:45.265 --> 02:48:48.129]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:48.369 --> 02:48:49.951]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.

[02:49:04.568 --> 02:49:07.410]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:07.490 --> 02:49:12.152]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:12.373 --> 02:49:16.735]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight, piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:16.995 --> 02:49:24.219]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:24.479 --> 02:49:26.901]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[02:50:44.208 --> 02:50:46.569]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:50:46.829 --> 02:50:50.671]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[02:50:50.991 --> 02:50:51.811]  Read the labels.
[02:50:52.231 --> 02:50:56.353]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:50:56.573 --> 02:51:00.775]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucus membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:51:01.136 --> 02:51:06.018]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.

[02:51:44.368 --> 02:51:49.992]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:51.493 --> 02:51:55.375]  Waging war on corruption, crashing through the lines of disinformation.
[02:51:55.395 --> 02:51:56.476]  I'll tell you what's clear.
[02:51:57.117 --> 02:51:58.818]  I've got to get Joe Bannister back on.
[02:51:58.858 --> 02:52:00.499]  I've got to get his two counselors...
[02:52:01.405 --> 02:52:10.513]  Mr. Bernhoff and Mr. Barnes back on for a couple hours because 40-something minutes of talk time is just not enough, and I want to jam a few final calls in here.
[02:52:10.573 --> 02:52:12.835]  But, Joe Bannister, there's something we need to get out here.
[02:52:13.416 --> 02:52:15.017]  Any websites you want to plug?
[02:52:15.117 --> 02:52:23.665]  And then lastly, before we go to these calls and get any final comments from your two counselors here, if you had to do all over again, would you do it again?
[02:52:24.458 --> 02:52:25.498]  Oh, absolutely, Alex.
[02:52:25.578 --> 02:52:31.319]  There's just no other way for me to live my life knowing that there's something that's wrong and not doing anything about it.
[02:52:31.340 --> 02:52:36.100]  In terms of website, freedomabovefortune.com.
[02:52:36.861 --> 02:52:45.963]  People can go to the IRS lockout update if they want to see actual documents from the case and from all the harassment that the IRS has sent my way.
[02:52:45.983 --> 02:52:48.923]  That's freedomabovefortune.com.
[02:52:49.703 --> 02:52:51.544]  What about for your two counselors?
[02:52:51.584 --> 02:52:52.744]  How do folks get in touch with them?
[02:52:53.539 --> 02:52:54.380]  Go ahead, Bob.
[02:52:54.420 --> 02:53:00.263]  We've got a website, www.BernhoffLaw.com.
[02:53:00.943 --> 02:53:02.844]  BernhoffLaw.com.
[02:53:03.705 --> 02:53:04.125]  All right.
[02:53:04.585 --> 02:53:06.466]  Yeah, B-E-R-N-H-O-F-T.
[02:53:06.566 --> 02:53:12.850]  All right, we'll get that up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:53:12.890 --> 02:53:15.992]  But you know what Joe just said, gentlemen, it sounds just like the Founding Fathers.
[02:53:16.052 --> 02:53:19.834]  I mean, evil men and tyrants flourish when good men and women do nothing.
[02:53:20.485 --> 02:53:28.411]  Joe Bannister, I'll tell you Alex, I've known Joe since about 1999 and I'm not in the habit of lavishing praise on people.
[02:53:28.511 --> 02:53:30.173]  I just don't do it.
[02:53:31.374 --> 02:53:32.815]  Joe is one of the finest men I've ever met.
[02:53:33.015 --> 02:53:35.417]  A man of integrity, personal and professional.
[02:53:36.536 --> 02:53:38.137]  A man of honesty and character.
[02:53:38.198 --> 02:53:44.061]  Yeah, I mean, you get the feeling, folks, and I'm good at reading people, you know, in this business, what I do, what he does in law enforcement.
[02:53:44.322 --> 02:53:45.662]  You also have to have that talent.
[02:53:46.023 --> 02:53:51.426]  But, I mean, he comes across as somebody from a Leave It to Beaver episode, so they had a real problem going after him.
[02:53:51.686 --> 02:53:54.468]  That's why we call him, affectionately, the last Boy Scout.
[02:53:55.369 --> 02:53:56.690]  You know, that's interesting.
[02:53:58.911 --> 02:54:01.353]  You know, Joe Bannister was the sort of public servant.
[02:54:01.393 --> 02:54:02.894]  We all know that we need government.
[02:54:04.382 --> 02:54:06.843]  As James Madison said, I believe in Federalist No.
[02:54:06.863 --> 02:54:08.623]  10, if men were angels, we wouldn't need government.
[02:54:08.663 --> 02:54:10.683]  Well, men aren't angels, and we need government.
[02:54:11.204 --> 02:54:15.424]  But Joe Bannister is the sort of public servant that American citizens would want to have.
[02:54:15.965 --> 02:54:22.766]  Somebody who took an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and took it seriously.
[02:54:22.786 --> 02:54:25.226]  I totally agree with you, and they tried to punish him.
[02:54:25.266 --> 02:54:25.787]  That's right.
[02:54:26.187 --> 02:54:27.227]  And the government's response?
[02:54:27.567 --> 02:54:33.008]  A criminal indictment facing, according to the New York Times, although it's probably not completely accurate given it's from the Times,
[02:54:34.207 --> 02:54:35.668]  14 years in federal prison.
[02:54:36.028 --> 02:54:36.328]  All right.
[02:54:36.368 --> 02:54:39.449]  Let's take two final quick calls here in the next minute and a half.
[02:54:40.389 --> 02:54:42.710]  David in Phoenix, Arizona, and then Delilah.
[02:54:42.730 --> 02:54:43.590]  That's all we have time for.
[02:54:43.630 --> 02:54:44.191]  Go ahead, David.
[02:54:44.871 --> 02:54:45.411]  Yes, Joe.
[02:54:45.471 --> 02:54:47.512]  I know we're really close on time here.
[02:54:47.912 --> 02:54:49.893]  I've read all of your e-mails.
[02:54:50.133 --> 02:54:53.454]  I've been reading your stuff from Freedom Above Fortune.
[02:54:54.734 --> 02:55:00.036]  And I've read all the work of Erwin Schiff and Larry Beatcraft.
[02:55:01.070 --> 02:55:03.932]  And I've been fighting this battle against the IRS for 30 years.
[02:55:04.153 --> 02:55:05.253]  You've got about 20 seconds, sir.
[02:55:05.754 --> 02:55:12.219]  Okay, one of the ways that you can actually oppose them... We had a conference in Kansas City.
[02:55:12.979 --> 02:55:14.841]  We went in and demanded their oath of office.
[02:55:16.923 --> 02:55:19.164]  Manager of the IRS officers in Kansas.
[02:55:19.545 --> 02:55:21.326]  Okay, listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:55:21.346 --> 02:55:24.208]  There are a lot of different legal strategies in this, folks.
[02:55:25.169 --> 02:55:27.291]  You know, challenging the legitimacy and all of this.
[02:55:27.351 --> 02:55:30.173]  But I really... Comments on that, gentlemen, quickly?
[02:55:31.643 --> 02:55:35.466]  Just that people should get aware of what the limitations to the authority are.
[02:55:35.486 --> 02:55:37.987]  That's one question that can be asked.
[02:55:38.108 --> 02:55:39.188]  Yes, and jurisdiction.
[02:55:39.388 --> 02:55:40.409]  Delilah in Ohio.
[02:55:40.429 --> 02:55:41.230]  You've got 30 seconds.
[02:55:41.290 --> 02:55:41.490]  Go.
[02:55:44.792 --> 02:55:45.773]  Delilah, go ahead.
[02:55:46.813 --> 02:55:48.374]  Okay, hi.
[02:55:48.434 --> 02:55:48.715]  Hi.
[02:55:49.375 --> 02:55:50.736]  Just have a real quick question.
[02:55:51.546 --> 02:55:58.871]  Based on your victory in court, what type of encouragement or hope or advice would you give the rest of us who are fighting?
[02:55:58.891 --> 02:55:59.292]  Good news.
[02:55:59.452 --> 02:56:00.412]  Great way to close it out.
[02:56:00.452 --> 02:56:01.713]  Joe Bannister, you've got 25 seconds.
[02:56:01.733 --> 02:56:02.714]  Take us out of here.
[02:56:03.374 --> 02:56:11.580]  You should tell yourself you're going to spend at least an hour a week, if not more, educating your friends, neighbors, and coworkers.
[02:56:12.313 --> 02:56:16.759]  As to what the truth is, so that when they serve on juries, this result continues to happen.
[02:56:16.819 --> 02:56:17.319]  All right.
[02:56:17.419 --> 02:56:20.503]  I want to thank Mr. Bannister, Mr. Barnes, and Mr. Bernhoff for coming on.
[02:56:20.543 --> 02:56:21.104]  God bless you.
[02:56:24.367 --> 02:56:27.972]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[02:56:28.232 --> 02:56:28.612]  Hello, folks.
[02:56:28.632 --> 02:56:28.873]  This is...
