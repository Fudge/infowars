[00:00:05.581 --> 00:00:06.221]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.901 --> 00:00:07.961]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.662 --> 00:00:09.782]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.402 --> 00:00:11.242]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.983 --> 00:00:12.863]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.583 --> 00:00:17.384]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.744 --> 00:00:21.806]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:39.112]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:39.992 --> 00:00:48.718]  It is Monday, already the 11th day of April, 2005, and we'll be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:48.778 --> 00:01:05.909]  Dr. Nick Begich will be joining us to talk about, well, just the New World Order's different military activities and some of the secret weapon systems they've developed and what's happening with the environment and a lot more coming up in about 30 minutes.
[00:01:07.992 --> 00:01:17.696]  So again, Dr. Nick Begich, talk about the HARP program and so much more, chemtrails, you name it, coming up here in about 30 minutes.
[00:01:17.716 --> 00:01:27.380]  The websites, freshly updated for you, are Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:01:29.441 --> 00:01:30.101]  Debate!
[00:01:30.521 --> 00:01:35.203]  Is a law needed to ban microchip implants in humans?
[00:01:36.676 --> 00:01:40.497]  This is out of the Journal Times mainstream publication.
[00:01:41.278 --> 00:01:49.280]  Representative Marlon Schindler doesn't want government getting under your skin.
[00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:59.044]  The Wisconsin Rapids Democrat is introducing a bill that would prohibit anyone, including the government and employers, from requiring microchip implants in people.
[00:02:00.518 --> 00:02:01.619]  And why is he doing it?
[00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:08.282]  Because Mexico and other governments are now attempting to force their employees to take the chip.
[00:02:08.342 --> 00:02:10.503]  And they say, well, it's not forced.
[00:02:10.623 --> 00:02:12.484]  You just won't have a job here anymore.
[00:02:14.005 --> 00:02:15.666]  But it violates your basic rights.
[00:02:15.706 --> 00:02:16.946]  It's like the drug testing.
[00:02:17.507 --> 00:02:19.528]  Well, you don't have to have a job here.
[00:02:20.028 --> 00:02:25.050]  And the Pentagon comes by every week and takes the samples for us as part of a public service.
[00:02:25.071 --> 00:02:27.752]  You know, that's been going on for at least five years.
[00:02:29.417 --> 00:02:32.179]  I have it on tape from Army News Watch, aired here locally.
[00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:33.840]  Nationally produced.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.380]  But there they are.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.643]  The Army, during the newscast, says, We'll send by our representatives.
[00:02:40.223 --> 00:02:41.144]  Take the samples.
[00:02:41.204 --> 00:02:41.964]  It's for free.
[00:02:43.065 --> 00:02:45.086]  It's part of infrastructure protection.
[00:02:45.626 --> 00:02:47.247]  Drug use hurts America.
[00:02:47.727 --> 00:02:49.508]  Our job is defending America.
[00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.850]  See, getting involved in everyday life.
[00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:52.910]  You didn't know that was going on?
[00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.952]  I have to mention that a couple times a year that that's going on.
[00:02:57.566 --> 00:02:58.947]  But the move is on.
[00:02:59.007 --> 00:03:02.329]  Yeah, you've got to have a microchip if you want to be in this line of work.
[00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:05.991]  So we'll talk about that article.
[00:03:06.051 --> 00:03:06.612]  Very interesting.
[00:03:07.732 --> 00:03:13.796]  Also, you know last week, the IMF came out and said, Oh yeah, oil's going to be $100 a barrel.
[00:03:13.836 --> 00:03:16.918]  And in 2010, we're running out of oil.
[00:03:21.312 --> 00:03:27.714]  And did we mention to you that we're controlled by the big oil companies and that we're a bunch of scamming criminals?
[00:03:28.854 --> 00:03:33.295]  Our own documents have been made public three years ago that we create artificial scarcity.
[00:03:33.635 --> 00:03:36.896]  We even have documents that are now public that explain how we run this scam.
[00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:40.917]  But you'll ignore that, especially in the controlled left.
[00:03:41.457 --> 00:03:45.378]  You'll run around promoting this conspiracy theory.
[00:03:47.634 --> 00:04:04.898]  And of course Goldman Sachs, who stood to make a bunch of money out of announcing that oil could hit over $10 a gallon, suddenly all of these peak oil people are going, see, see, see, we told you so.
[00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:06.218]  No, no, we told you so.
[00:04:07.418 --> 00:04:14.820]  We told you that they were going to have the IMF and World Bank and OPEC and our own government.
[00:04:15.436 --> 00:04:18.857]  Announce there's no oil so they can gouge the living daylights out of us.
[00:04:20.258 --> 00:04:21.138]  We went over this.
[00:04:21.198 --> 00:04:25.680]  I mean, look, you don't see Rolling Stone doing cover stories on how there's no oil left.
[00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.261]  Now it's going to have to be martial law to keep us safe.
[00:04:29.661 --> 00:04:31.882]  Oh, now we need martial law!
[00:04:35.823 --> 00:04:36.744]  So I want to talk about this.
[00:04:38.024 --> 00:04:40.585]  There is just so much, so much more.
[00:04:41.425 --> 00:04:48.815]  Coming up in the next two hours and 55 minutes, but I am going to talk some about peak oil, peak scam.
[00:04:48.835 --> 00:04:54.863]  And finally, it hits the establishment media.
[00:04:54.963 --> 00:04:55.224]  U.S.
[00:04:55.304 --> 00:04:58.528]  Intel once considered using huge quake bombs.
[00:04:58.568 --> 00:04:59.049]  We'll be back.
[00:05:01.204 --> 00:05:08.031]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:09.713]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:05:09.913 --> 00:05:12.115]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:12.275 --> 00:05:14.377]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:14.638 --> 00:05:19.562]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:19.923 --> 00:05:23.947]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:05:24.187 --> 00:05:24.628]  We're good to go.
[00:05:39.124 --> 00:05:39.324]  That's 888-2533-139.
[00:05:39.404 --> 00:05:41.326]  Or order online at InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net.
[00:05:41.346 --> 00:05:42.027]  Again, that number, 888-2533-139.
[00:06:00.507 --> 00:06:01.287]  Terrorism.
[00:06:01.427 --> 00:06:02.168]  Terrorism.
[00:06:02.268 --> 00:06:03.108]  Chemical attacks.
[00:06:03.188 --> 00:06:03.848]  Dirty bombs.
[00:06:03.948 --> 00:06:04.348]  Fallout.
[00:06:04.448 --> 00:06:05.429]  Biological attack.
[00:06:05.609 --> 00:06:06.149]  Anthrax.
[00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:08.329]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:10.190]  Alarming words for our time.
[00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.911]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:06:13.291 --> 00:06:27.875]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:27.895 --> 00:06:28.215]  government.
[00:06:28.395 --> 00:06:30.216]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:06:30.576 --> 00:06:36.478]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:36.619 --> 00:06:41.120]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:48.823]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:48.843 --> 00:06:50.784]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.421]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:07:02.682 --> 00:07:06.524]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[00:07:06.844 --> 00:07:07.665]  Read the labels.
[00:07:08.085 --> 00:07:12.227]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:07:12.427 --> 00:07:16.630]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:21.873]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:07:22.253 --> 00:07:25.835]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:07:26.036 --> 00:07:31.379]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:34.381]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:07:34.681 --> 00:07:35.562]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:07:35.862 --> 00:07:46.609]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.
[00:07:46.969 --> 00:07:48.390]  Call Cal Ben toll-free at 1-800-340-7091.
[00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:49.430]  That's 800-340-7091, or visit calbenpuresoap.com.
[00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.132]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.788 --> 00:08:20.450]  The average gas price in this country is $2.16.
[00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:28.096]  Some places they're paying as much as $3.50 a gallon.
[00:08:29.997 --> 00:08:36.121]  Now, ten years ago in Europe they were paying $4 a gallon if you converted over to dollars.
[00:08:36.681 --> 00:08:39.063]  Why were they paying $4 when we were paying a dollar?
[00:08:40.444 --> 00:08:43.466]  Because their governments chose to tax them
[00:08:44.808 --> 00:08:49.849]  Upwards of 75% of the cost of fuel being taxation.
[00:08:50.769 --> 00:08:52.690]  Petrol, as they call it.
[00:08:54.430 --> 00:09:07.513]  Why is diesel in this country in many cases costing even more than regular unleaded gasoline when diesel is much easier to distill?
[00:09:08.914 --> 00:09:10.594]  Because they're running a scam.
[00:09:12.615 --> 00:09:14.035]  And I am so busy
[00:09:14.801 --> 00:09:15.862]  We're good to go.
[00:09:38.217 --> 00:09:46.321]  Just scores of reports about giant oil fields being found all over the planet on a monthly basis.
[00:09:48.823 --> 00:10:03.751]  I have the different oil discoveries even going back into the 50s off the coast of Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, Mexico, Alaska, Russia, the Bering Sea, the Indian Ocean.
[00:10:04.111 --> 00:10:05.752]  Oil is everywhere.
[00:10:08.536 --> 00:10:10.697]  But a lot of people don't want to hear the facts.
[00:10:12.117 --> 00:10:14.058]  They don't want to understand what's really happening.
[00:10:14.638 --> 00:10:31.104]  So let me just first give you a key piece of evidence up front before I jump into this and then get into other news reports here, like a law being proposed to make it illegal for businesses in the government to force you to take implantable microchips.
[00:10:31.924 --> 00:10:34.265]  This is from the Journal Times, Mainstream News.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:40.403]  Because Applied Digital and others are proposing having to have it to fly on an airplane to track you with your luggage.
[00:10:41.644 --> 00:10:49.829]  The Mexican government has made hundreds of members of its Justice Department take the chips to be able to go to work and get into secure areas.
[00:10:51.349 --> 00:10:53.531]  There's discussions of making our military take it.
[00:10:54.291 --> 00:10:55.872]  This is very, very serious.
[00:10:55.912 --> 00:10:57.853]  Discussions of making prisoners take it.
[00:10:57.873 --> 00:11:02.516]  In fact, two years ago, a deal was signed with the Bureau of Prisons in California
[00:11:03.556 --> 00:11:06.397]  That was in Reuters, and then once it went public, they cancelled it.
[00:11:06.978 --> 00:11:15.602]  So they like to do this, and it is 2005, we're back to the future, this is real, and it sounds bizarre, but it's happening.
[00:11:16.742 --> 00:11:32.610]  And I've just got a giant stack of other important news, but let me cover peak oil first, because this is really important, and I've been talking about this for years, and I said I had an open mind, I was researching it, but I went over the facts that I was leaning towards it being a complete fraud,
[00:11:34.438 --> 00:11:42.701]  Number one, because it follows the classic scam or racket of the New World Order.
[00:11:44.902 --> 00:11:59.387]  Now after literally hundreds of hours of studying this, if not more, I can definitively, and now I've got to put it all down on paper and hundreds of links and declare my war on the peak oil scammers.
[00:12:02.543 --> 00:12:08.285]  Because this is really a jewel in the crown of the New World Order's neo-feudalist program.
[00:12:09.625 --> 00:12:13.507]  Now I've got to spend the time to expose it.
[00:12:13.767 --> 00:12:15.487]  Who knows, I might even make a film about it.
[00:12:17.468 --> 00:12:20.969]  But again, there's just so many issues, so many topics I want to cover.
[00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:26.571]  It makes my head spin trying to even put it all on the table.
[00:12:26.631 --> 00:12:28.512]  I mean, there's so much evidence of this fraud.
[00:12:29.728 --> 00:12:32.730]  So much evidence of this duplicitous scam.
[00:12:35.051 --> 00:12:37.412]  But let's just talk about how the New World Order operates.
[00:12:37.452 --> 00:12:40.354]  Number one, they confuse us with phony left-right debates.
[00:12:42.014 --> 00:12:50.559]  Whereas Hillary Clinton and Chuckie Schumer are all voting identically with George Bush on open borders, war, gun control.
[00:12:52.685 --> 00:13:00.271]  The general public doesn't know that because the controlled media does a good job of acting like there's some type of fight or debate going on.
[00:13:03.634 --> 00:13:12.342]  And so people think that the IMF and World Bank and the top hundred corporations on this planet, they think that they're free market.
[00:13:13.302 --> 00:13:17.366]  They think that they want good business and want a high standard of living.
[00:13:20.009 --> 00:13:43.014]  When their own documents show they want consolidation and control, a neo-feudalist world empire, where the corporations become the government of the 100 top corporations in the world, 45 of them are in the top 100 economies.
[00:13:43.214 --> 00:13:44.695]  That is, out of 100...
[00:13:46.408 --> 00:13:51.552]  Top economies in the world, 45 of them are companies, are corporations.
[00:13:52.132 --> 00:14:11.005]  And now through, quote, the scam of privatization, which is not privatization, the corporations that operate as organized crime syndicates, as mafias, have paid off the politicians and governments, gotten the laws written to literally make these top corporations governments in full.
[00:14:13.175 --> 00:14:16.337]  Owning and running the highways, making them all toll roads.
[00:14:17.077 --> 00:14:19.819]  Forcibly psychologically testing and drugging your children.
[00:14:20.239 --> 00:14:25.042]  Owning their giant private prisons that are popping up like mushrooms after a spring rain.
[00:14:26.562 --> 00:14:27.823]  Being constructed everywhere.
[00:14:28.764 --> 00:14:36.668]  Owning and controlling the private military and owning the government and having that government order attacks on sovereign nations and then handing over...
[00:14:37.318 --> 00:14:38.959]  And that's really the biggest problem.
[00:14:38.979 --> 00:14:40.160]  And so we look at peak oil.
[00:15:03.519 --> 00:15:13.385]  We have the IMF World Bank documents released just days after Joseph Siklitz, the chief economist at the World Bank, quit in 2002.
[00:15:15.086 --> 00:15:16.567]  Over 2,000 pages of documents.
[00:15:17.027 --> 00:15:21.129]  Greg Palast at the BBC first got the documents and broke the news.
[00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:24.851]  And he's published the documents and reported on them.
[00:15:25.192 --> 00:15:27.633]  They actually give the example of Argentina.
[00:15:31.098 --> 00:15:33.179]  Well, Argentina's gone along with our model.
[00:15:33.219 --> 00:15:34.659]  They've, quote, privatized.
[00:15:34.719 --> 00:15:41.342]  They've handed over most of their resources to select corporations.
[00:15:43.482 --> 00:15:49.965]  Now we're going to implode their economy, tell the people it's their fault.
[00:15:50.405 --> 00:15:56.687]  Now that we own their water and their fuel and their infrastructure, we're going to turn off the services.
[00:15:57.247 --> 00:15:59.408]  And they said it will only take one week
[00:16:01.118 --> 00:16:03.919]  To two weeks to cause total riots.
[00:16:04.039 --> 00:16:07.719]  And they call it the IMF riot in the documents.
[00:16:08.139 --> 00:16:09.640]  They talk about how they've done this in other countries.
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:15.101]  They say the people will not accept a tripling in their water prices.
[00:16:16.961 --> 00:16:29.284]  But if we turn their water off and tell them there's no water, then they will freak out, and when we finally turn it back on, they'll just be thankful for it and pay triple for the water out of the gates.
[00:16:31.778 --> 00:16:46.001]  Now simultaneously, even before these documents came out, even before Argentina plunged into darkness, this is very important.
[00:16:47.982 --> 00:16:52.163]  I was reading UN documents where they were saying there's not going to be any oil soon.
[00:16:52.483 --> 00:16:54.903]  There's not going to be any water, fresh water soon.
[00:16:55.443 --> 00:16:57.724]  There's not going to be any farmland soon.
[00:16:58.502 --> 00:16:59.902]  We've got to protect what's left.
[00:16:59.942 --> 00:17:05.523]  We've got to put people forcibly into those cities and give the land to corporations that can manage it more wisely.
[00:17:06.264 --> 00:17:07.144]  On and on and on.
[00:17:07.864 --> 00:17:11.265]  It's an excuse for this criminal mafia to come in and steal.
[00:17:12.965 --> 00:17:16.786]  We have the De Beers model with the Oppenheimers, the world diamond monopoly.
[00:17:17.106 --> 00:17:18.206]  It's been on PBS.
[00:17:18.286 --> 00:17:18.886]  They admit it.
[00:17:19.386 --> 00:17:22.307]  Giant warehouses with huge bins full of diamonds.
[00:17:23.087 --> 00:17:23.907]  Five feet deep.
[00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:26.810]  Huge warehouses full of diamonds.
[00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:29.992]  Diamonds are hardly even on the scale of semi-precious.
[00:17:30.312 --> 00:17:44.800]  They're on the lower end of semi-precious, but because De Beers has an army, a private army, even New Yorker magazines reported, where they'll send in thousands of special forces private troops to slaughter whole villages and go after people, they have a world diamond monopoly.
[00:17:46.804 --> 00:17:55.130]  And so you'll pay $10,000, $8,000 for a little diamond ring so your woman feels like you love her when you get engaged to her.
[00:17:57.651 --> 00:18:07.258]  And everybody knows, who's got any history or any facts, it is admitted, diamonds aren't even hardly, they're right on the bottom of the spectrum of semi-precious.
[00:18:07.798 --> 00:18:08.979]  They're hardly semi-precious.
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.242]  But they are the most precious stone because they say they are.
[00:18:14.452 --> 00:18:15.413]  Because they have a monopoly.
[00:18:15.874 --> 00:18:27.525]  Five companies now control 95% of world oil production, and now they're in the process of merging down to four and then three in the next year.
[00:18:29.665 --> 00:18:45.798]  And their publications, their control systems, their IMF, their World Bank, their UN, publications like Rolling Stone, their phony left-wing so-called grassroots blogs, their little bought-and-paid-for blogs that are out there telling you there's no oil left.
[00:18:45.918 --> 00:18:46.719]  It is a scam.
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:53.745]  If oil prices have dropped per barrel back to 53, why are you still going to pay more?
[00:18:56.326 --> 00:18:58.587]  It's just like the oil crisis of the 70s.
[00:18:58.967 --> 00:19:00.447]  That's admitted to be a fraud.
[00:19:00.807 --> 00:19:05.049]  It's admitted there was plenty of oil, but they had to train you to accept a massive increase.
[00:19:07.829 --> 00:19:24.294]  And so while we fight this, we're going to have phony grassroots organizations and their useful idiot camp followers running around telling us there's no oil, beating the drum for sustainable development, i.e., letting their corporate masters steal more private property.
[00:19:27.518 --> 00:19:32.822]  And I can go over all the evidence of how much oil there is, how they're finding all these new fields, all of it.
[00:19:34.944 --> 00:19:37.606]  And I'm going to take the time, I'm going to put it together for you.
[00:19:39.448 --> 00:19:42.250]  You can check out the facts for yourself, and I hope you'll spread the word on it.
[00:19:46.213 --> 00:19:47.354]  It's just such a scam.
[00:19:48.815 --> 00:19:52.078]  And now the INF, who the liberals will tell you are evil,
[00:19:53.497 --> 00:19:54.739]  Oh, but they're good this time.
[00:19:54.839 --> 00:19:55.800]  Oh, we can trust them.
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:56.881]  There's no oil.
[00:19:57.081 --> 00:19:58.482]  The bankers told us so.
[00:19:59.123 --> 00:20:02.967]  We'll be back.
[00:20:03.087 --> 00:20:03.628]  Hi, folks.
[00:20:03.668 --> 00:20:05.409]  Jack Browning from Midas Resources.
[00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:06.731]  The real money, folks.
[00:20:10.033 --> 00:20:13.435]  Let's review a few things from the past year, November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:20:13.495 --> 00:20:15.376]  The Dow has ranged from 9,800 to 10,300, a 5% increase.
[00:20:15.956 --> 00:20:22.039]  The dollar's value has dropped from 96 cents to 70 cents against the euro, a 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[00:20:31.286 --> 00:20:32.146]  We're good to go.
[00:20:32.166 --> 00:20:32.326]  I think?
[00:21:02.759 --> 00:21:07.264]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:21:07.604 --> 00:21:11.708]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:21:11.988 --> 00:21:12.529]  We listened.
[00:21:12.849 --> 00:21:17.834]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:21:18.114 --> 00:21:18.595]  We listened.
[00:21:18.975 --> 00:21:22.018]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:21:22.459 --> 00:21:22.979]  We listened.
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.783]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[00:21:26.823 --> 00:21:27.384]  We're good to go.
[00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:54.311]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:21:54.331 --> 00:21:55.752]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:22:13.314 --> 00:22:13.754]  We're good to go.
[00:22:13.774 --> 00:22:14.014]  I think?
[00:22:43.812 --> 00:22:44.352]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:53.954 --> 00:22:55.235]  It's absolutely free.
[00:22:55.695 --> 00:22:57.996]  Operators are standing by to assist you.
[00:22:58.616 --> 00:23:00.277]  Just call right now.
[00:23:00.717 --> 00:23:06.239]  We've all heard about the benefits of infrared light therapy, but never have we heard of anything as amazing as this.
[00:23:06.439 --> 00:23:13.282]  Diametics, the leading authority on polychromatic infrared diode therapy in the U.S., now offers its patented Panex 2000 to the public.
[00:23:14.102 --> 00:23:20.710]  The PainX 2000 uses the same technology NASA uses aboard the space shuttle and the same technology used by the Navy SEALs.
[00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:22.272]  Now it's available to you.
[00:23:22.452 --> 00:23:29.080]  The PainX 2000 is FDA cleared for joint aches and pains, increases circulation, and relaxes those achy muscles.
[00:23:29.281 --> 00:23:33.526]  Diametics has literally written the book on polychromatic infrared diode therapy.
[00:23:33.826 --> 00:23:40.110]  Using five different wavelengths in the Panex 2000 has made it the most advanced infrared light therapy product on the market today.
[00:23:40.231 --> 00:23:44.313]  With over 12 different models to choose from, there's a Panex 2000 device for everyone.

[00:24:12.046 --> 00:24:13.087]  Your calls are coming up.
[00:24:13.107 --> 00:24:15.828]  We also have Dr. Nick Begich joining us.
[00:24:17.689 --> 00:24:20.650]  And later I'm going to get more into peak oil and how it's a total scam.
[00:24:21.631 --> 00:24:23.232]  But here's the IMF.
[00:24:24.652 --> 00:24:33.197]  I mean, we have the Henry Kissinger documents where the IMF ordered the Third World to sterilize forcibly half their women or no more loans.
[00:24:33.737 --> 00:24:35.878]  And these are loans where they take our tax money...
[00:24:36.545 --> 00:24:37.926]  And give it to these third world countries.
[00:24:38.046 --> 00:24:39.586]  Openly pay off the dictator.
[00:24:40.026 --> 00:24:41.307]  Not to pay off the loans.
[00:24:41.327 --> 00:24:42.567]  The dictator retires.
[00:24:43.008 --> 00:24:47.790]  Hands over all of the resources to these criminals.
[00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:53.312]  I mean, we're going to have Wolfowitz running the World Bank.
[00:24:53.332 --> 00:24:56.393]  I mean, the World Bank and IMF are like two legs on the same ogre.
[00:24:58.214 --> 00:24:59.174]  Run by the same people.
[00:25:00.255 --> 00:25:01.195]  Here's another example.
[00:25:01.775 --> 00:25:06.337]  They say Iraq owes $200 billion for the great liberation we've given them.
[00:25:07.099 --> 00:25:09.160]  And they've got $4 trillion in oil.
[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:13.481]  Conservatively in discovered oil fields in the country.
[00:25:14.401 --> 00:25:21.763]  And now they're setting up, quote, privatizations with the World Bank, and they're saying now in their reports, oh, Iraq will never get out of this debt.
[00:25:22.803 --> 00:25:23.084]  Oh, really?
[00:25:23.104 --> 00:25:24.884]  They could sell $200 billion in a year easy.
[00:25:25.284 --> 00:25:28.125]  They could be out of debt in one year, even if we believe this debt was real.
[00:25:28.805 --> 00:25:32.606]  But no, sorry, you'll never be out of debt.
[00:25:33.346 --> 00:25:34.967]  And there's no oil either.
[00:25:37.731 --> 00:25:41.153]  But the IMF says so, and so all these groups are out there crowing.
[00:25:41.753 --> 00:25:46.916]  No, no, no, we should be crowing our forethought and understanding.
[00:25:47.456 --> 00:25:50.417]  Because I said you're going to have the UN, the IMF, all of them pushing this.
[00:25:50.458 --> 00:25:51.018]  They already were.
[00:25:51.958 --> 00:25:53.199]  But now they're pushing it big time.
[00:25:53.439 --> 00:25:56.060]  You're paying more for oil because there's none of it left!
[00:25:57.301 --> 00:25:58.302]  That's made up!
[00:26:00.122 --> 00:26:05.005]  There's enough oil in one area of Alaska to run this country for 100 years, conservative numbers.
[00:26:05.543 --> 00:26:13.508]  There's enough to run the entire globe in one 600 square mile area off the coast of Louisiana that the U.S.
[00:26:13.528 --> 00:26:15.189]  government will not allow exploration of.
[00:26:15.889 --> 00:26:27.537]  In one area, easy to get to, the same amount of oil as has been used by humans on this planet in the last 100 years since the oil age began.
[00:26:27.557 --> 00:26:33.040]  Before that it was whale oil, which is certainly not renewable.
[00:26:34.298 --> 00:26:43.101]  And at the right, they were killing whales, and I'm firmly against killing whales for their oil, or for their bones, so you can have a nice umbrella.
[00:26:44.602 --> 00:26:54.005]  The IMF said that rising living standards in China and the rest of the developing world will keep oil prices sky-high for decades to come, with even $100 a barrel not ruled out.
[00:26:56.687 --> 00:26:59.588]  Goldman Sachs says, well, it's going to be much worse than that.
[00:26:59.968 --> 00:27:02.129]  Meanwhile, they make money off of the futures.
[00:27:02.629 --> 00:27:11.472]  There they are, involved in oil futures, total public insider trading, manipulating the price as they bet with put options right before this happened.
[00:27:11.792 --> 00:27:15.534]  I mean, it is so transparent.
[00:27:17.134 --> 00:27:17.954]  But they're smart.
[00:27:18.074 --> 00:27:19.575]  Just look, they've got fake blogs.
[00:27:20.293 --> 00:27:26.776]  With Jeff Gannon and fake groups that go testify before James Baker and the Election Commission.
[00:27:26.796 --> 00:27:39.381]  You've got the guy who ran the election scams in Florida sitting as the head of the commission, and then they even have GOP operatives as fake grassroots groups coming forward and saying, I love electronic voting.
[00:27:39.821 --> 00:27:40.901]  Don't violate our rights.
[00:27:40.961 --> 00:27:41.562]  Give it to us.
[00:27:41.602 --> 00:27:43.742]  The media goes, look at this independent group.
[00:27:44.803 --> 00:27:45.683]  It's the same thing with this.
[00:27:45.723 --> 00:27:47.624]  They've got all their little minion groups out there.
[00:27:49.901 --> 00:27:50.581]  Promoting this.
[00:27:51.322 --> 00:28:02.926]  And it's twice yearly World Economic Outlook International Monetary Fund predicted that in 2030 the average price of a barrel of oil would stand in the range of $39 to $56 in real terms.
[00:28:04.506 --> 00:28:17.411]  In normal terms, without adjusting for inflation, the price would be $67 to $96, it said, owing to exploding demand for cars in countries such as China and India spend their newfound wealth.
[00:28:20.162 --> 00:28:24.984]  And they went on to say that they believe the exploration of oil will not meet demand.
[00:28:26.205 --> 00:28:35.730]  Fears of an economic crunch have intensified with oil prices up at around 40% since the start of the year to surpass $58 a barrel for the first time.
[00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:39.052]  Yeah, and if you look at the last year, oil prices were up almost 90%.
[00:28:40.773 --> 00:28:44.835]  But the last three, four months, yeah, they're up 40%.
[00:28:46.395 --> 00:28:49.077]  IMF Chief Rodrigo Ratto
[00:28:50.163 --> 00:28:58.451]  Warned this week that high prices would have been between 0.25 and 0.5 percentage points off global economic growth this year.
[00:29:00.413 --> 00:29:10.222]  Now, I've got to tell you, frankly, the real reason oil prices have gone up, it's not even oil company profit-taking, though they're all registering record profits.
[00:29:10.542 --> 00:29:11.603]  But that's a small part of it.
[00:29:13.204 --> 00:29:15.867]  And then using that money to buy up everything else they hadn't already bought.
[00:29:16.775 --> 00:29:23.638]  And to buy more media and more fake newscasts and the rest of it, and to buy up other competitor oil companies, little stragglers.
[00:29:25.898 --> 00:29:27.679]  The real reason is inflation.
[00:29:28.719 --> 00:29:33.201]  The dollar has plunged in value 45 plus percent.
[00:29:35.202 --> 00:29:37.783]  And so you're going to see an increase in oil prices.
[00:29:37.803 --> 00:29:43.885]  So half of it is inflation, and the other part is oil companies scamming.
[00:29:45.521 --> 00:29:46.702]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:46.722 --> 00:29:49.324]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.766 --> 00:29:52.687]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.167 --> 00:29:54.789]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:58.392]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.403 --> 00:30:09.027]  If you're $10,000 in credit card debt or more and are making minimum monthly payments but getting nowhere, Debt Relief USA has the answer.
[00:30:09.167 --> 00:30:12.649]  Call 1-800-516-6567 now.
[00:30:12.809 --> 00:30:16.751]  Debt Relief USA has ways through special programs to reduce your principal and interest.
[00:30:17.031 --> 00:30:19.573]  You may qualify to reduce your credit card debt as much as 75%.

[00:30:26.556 --> 00:30:26.737]  I think?
[00:30:42.307 --> 00:30:47.971]  For the relief you need, Debt Relief USA is helping Americans re-secure their financial future one client at a time, excluding Maryland and New York.
[00:31:01.039 --> 00:31:09.305]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:09.565 --> 00:31:13.908]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.208 --> 00:31:23.133]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:23.334 --> 00:31:26.956]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:31:27.236 --> 00:31:32.285]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:32.566 --> 00:31:39.318]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:31:39.799 --> 00:31:40.339]  What about you?
[00:31:41.073 --> 00:31:48.976]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:32:07.604 --> 00:32:08.825]  Dr. Cass Ingram has stated...
[00:32:09.265 --> 00:32:19.892]  Extracts of wild oregano, notably the P-7-3 oil, and particularly the P-7-3 oregano, completely obliterate the human cold virus in 20 minutes in one dose with a 100% kill.

[00:33:24.611 --> 00:33:25.731]  Central Standard Time.
[00:33:26.092 --> 00:33:28.293]  Back from 9 to midnight, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:33:28.793 --> 00:33:29.813]  I'm not left or right.
[00:33:30.814 --> 00:33:31.834]  I'm about right and wrong.
[00:33:31.934 --> 00:33:32.735]  I love freedom.
[00:33:32.815 --> 00:33:35.436]  I know the political process is a dog and pony show.
[00:33:35.796 --> 00:33:36.797]  Smoke and mirrors.
[00:33:37.357 --> 00:33:38.037]  A scam.
[00:33:38.058 --> 00:33:38.618]  A carnival.
[00:33:38.918 --> 00:33:40.299]  Buster fraud.
[00:33:40.319 --> 00:33:42.360]  A WWF wrestling match.
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:46.922]  A Shakespearean theatrical display and presentation.
[00:33:49.409 --> 00:33:53.751]  And I know what the New World Order is setting up and what they're doing because I have their own documents.
[00:33:53.771 --> 00:33:57.213]  These globalists have to communicate with their technocrats.
[00:33:57.353 --> 00:34:00.255]  They have to give their orders out in written form.
[00:34:00.275 --> 00:34:01.796]  They hide it in plain view.
[00:34:02.757 --> 00:34:04.598]  Peak oil is a total fraud.
[00:34:04.618 --> 00:34:06.238]  It is part of artificial scarcity.
[00:34:06.559 --> 00:34:11.481]  And it's designed to keep us from going to the new alternative energy sources they've had for decades.
[00:34:11.501 --> 00:34:14.063]  We're going to talk about that with Dr. Nick Begich, who...
[00:34:15.086 --> 00:34:16.647]  I instinctively knew he would agree with me.
[00:34:17.107 --> 00:34:19.088]  Didn't ask him before we set him up as a guest if he agreed.
[00:34:19.108 --> 00:34:20.808]  Didn't even tell him what the topic was.
[00:34:21.189 --> 00:34:23.730]  Just talked to him during the break and, well, he agrees with me.
[00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:28.692]  Because anybody who's got a brain, who's looked at the facts, who knows the evidence, and he's up in Alaska.
[00:34:28.712 --> 00:34:31.673]  His father was a congressman who studied these matters as well.
[00:34:31.733 --> 00:34:32.653]  He knows all the scams.
[00:34:32.994 --> 00:34:34.334]  We're going to be talking about that.
[00:34:34.794 --> 00:34:37.435]  But I originally got him on to talk about tsunami bombs.
[00:34:38.136 --> 00:34:39.116]  Here's the headline.
[00:34:39.156 --> 00:34:42.758]  Now, this was first reported by PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:42.778 --> 00:34:43.278]  We dug up
[00:34:44.058 --> 00:34:45.499]  The 1950s news articles.
[00:34:46.319 --> 00:34:53.942]  Then it was picked up by Australian newspapers, and now a month later, more than that, two months later, you heard me talk about it on Alan Cohn's show.
[00:34:54.362 --> 00:34:57.984]  I'm not tooting our horn, it's just that I wish World Net Daily would give us some credit.
[00:34:58.424 --> 00:34:58.724]  U.S.
[00:34:58.884 --> 00:35:05.987]  Intel, once considered causing huge quake, World War II era top secret project, talked of producing tsunami with an A-bomb.
[00:35:06.007 --> 00:35:09.548]  And I remember Dr. Begich talking about stuff like this back in 1999.
[00:35:11.451 --> 00:35:13.653]  And then coming on this show in 2000 and talking about it.
[00:35:14.113 --> 00:35:19.157]  So he really deserves some credit, writing several books on this subject.
[00:35:19.997 --> 00:35:26.662]  And I'm not saying the government did this, but I am saying that even Secretary of Defense Cohen in 1997 admits this stuff exists.
[00:35:26.942 --> 00:35:27.903]  So we'll talk about this.
[00:35:27.923 --> 00:35:28.764]  We'll talk about HAARP.
[00:35:29.004 --> 00:35:31.586]  We'll talk about Ariel Spring, Kim Trailing.
[00:35:31.946 --> 00:35:34.748]  We'll talk about it all with who I consider to be one of the leading experts.
[00:35:35.228 --> 00:35:40.232]  And I was getting them on about all those issues, but then I just went on this whole...
[00:35:40.981 --> 00:35:51.310]  30-minute rant before Dr. Baggage joined us, talking about peak oil, because the IMF is pushing that fraud, and got a chance to talk to him during the break, and he concurred and has even more info for us.
[00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:54.152]  So we'll be going to Dr. Baggage here in a few minutes, then to your calls.
[00:35:54.553 --> 00:35:55.954]  He'll be with us for two hours!
[00:35:56.574 --> 00:35:57.815]  So we're very honored to have him.
[00:35:58.256 --> 00:36:05.702]  But before we go to Dr. Baggage, I've got to tell you, we've got two new items on PrisonPlanet.com's shopping cart.
[00:36:06.623 --> 00:36:07.744]  And if you call the toll-free number.
[00:36:08.456 --> 00:36:14.357]  Martial Law, my three-hour tour de force, three-hour long documentary.
[00:36:14.397 --> 00:36:15.638]  It's a police state film.
[00:36:15.678 --> 00:36:18.178]  It's a 9-11 film, the best out there, bar none.
[00:36:18.598 --> 00:36:27.441]  And it shows the globalist ideology, the cult of death, the order of death that controlled the Nazis, the Bushes, Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, all of it.
[00:36:27.521 --> 00:36:29.861]  It is the most well-produced film I've ever made.
[00:36:30.201 --> 00:36:32.042]  You've got to have this, folks.
[00:36:33.782 --> 00:36:37.323]  You ought to read the rave reviews, not just on my website, but all over the web.
[00:36:38.258 --> 00:36:43.001]  Just type in Marshall Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State, and read the reviews out there.
[00:36:43.561 --> 00:36:46.342]  Last night I just typed the name in and spent about an hour reading them.
[00:36:46.923 --> 00:36:48.423]  Believe me, folks, it's my best work.
[00:36:48.463 --> 00:36:49.144]  You've got to have it.
[00:36:49.684 --> 00:36:52.746]  DVD, $25.95, because it's really three films in one.
[00:36:53.446 --> 00:36:55.587]  VHS is two hours, 35 minutes long.
[00:36:55.887 --> 00:36:57.048]  You've got to get this film.
[00:36:57.628 --> 00:36:58.809]  We've got discounts when you get...
[00:37:00.026 --> 00:37:02.407]  Each additional copy you get, it goes down in price.
[00:37:02.447 --> 00:37:04.068]  You can buy a bunch of copies and give them to people.
[00:37:04.349 --> 00:37:06.010]  Or just get it and make copies yourself.
[00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.490]  Please.
[00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:08.011]  I just want to get it out to people.
[00:37:08.411 --> 00:37:13.554]  Or go to prisonplanet.tv where you can sign up and get a membership.
[00:37:14.314 --> 00:37:14.795]  $0.15 a day.
[00:37:15.295 --> 00:37:16.896]  Monthly and yearly subscriptions.
[00:37:17.765 --> 00:37:18.606]  You're good to go.
[00:37:18.626 --> 00:37:18.806]  I think?
[00:37:41.568 --> 00:37:42.128]  I don't care.
[00:37:42.208 --> 00:37:43.369]  Just get it out to people.
[00:37:43.709 --> 00:37:53.895]  Fifteen cents, it just pays for the bandwidth and allows me to pay my webmasters so they don't have to live in government housing.
[00:37:55.055 --> 00:37:57.937]  So, again, prisonplanet.tv.
[00:37:58.017 --> 00:37:59.698]  Nobody fights harder for you, folks.
[00:38:00.298 --> 00:38:01.799]  I work 17 hours a day.
[00:38:01.819 --> 00:38:03.460]  You've got to get this new video.
[00:38:04.119 --> 00:38:05.680]  Call toll free to get a hard copy.
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:06.300]  1-888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:11.822]  Or you can simply write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:38:12.122 --> 00:38:14.063]  We also have t-shirts, new t-shirts.
[00:38:14.083 --> 00:38:17.364]  We still have the old classic t-shirts, but we've got
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:33.642]  After three years of not making new t-shirts, we've got two new t-shirts.
[00:38:34.102 --> 00:38:35.062]  For men and women.
[00:38:35.142 --> 00:38:37.784]  Tank tops for women and plastic tees for men.
[00:38:38.224 --> 00:38:43.767]  On the front it says, In an age of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[00:38:44.367 --> 00:38:46.188]  And of course, it says George Arwell.
[00:38:46.288 --> 00:38:49.550]  On the back it says, Learn the truth, Infowars.com.
[00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:52.231]  Simple, good conversation piece.
[00:38:52.531 --> 00:38:55.713]  You'll meet like-minded people at the grocery store, at church.
[00:38:56.751 --> 00:39:00.813]  Wherever you go, at the Greenbelt, when you're out riding your bike, whatever.
[00:39:00.913 --> 00:39:01.914]  It's a great t-shirt.
[00:39:02.374 --> 00:39:04.875]  Some people said my other shirts were a little too shocking.
[00:39:07.076 --> 00:39:10.058]  This isn't as shocking, but it will help you meet like-minded people.
[00:39:10.078 --> 00:39:11.079]  That's what it's really for.
[00:39:12.019 --> 00:39:14.940]  And believe me, I wear these shirts out, and they get a lot of attention.
[00:39:15.861 --> 00:39:17.842]  And they're printed up, ready to ship out to you.
[00:39:18.382 --> 00:39:19.723]  We have them in black and white.
[00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:21.632]  We have them for men and women.
[00:39:22.233 --> 00:39:23.034]  So prisonplanet.tv.
[00:39:23.054 --> 00:39:27.359]  You can order via the Safe Secure Shopping Cart or infowars.com or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:39:32.786 --> 00:39:35.388]  Now let's shift gears back to our guest.
[00:39:35.788 --> 00:39:38.010]  He's been holding patiently, Dr. Nick Begich.
[00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:40.451]  And, Doctor, you haven't been on the show in about a year.
[00:39:40.932 --> 00:39:44.134]  Most people have heard you, though, on other talk shows or on Coast to Coast.
[00:39:44.534 --> 00:39:53.280]  But just in a nutshell, in a thumbnail, tell us about yourself and your journey seeking the truth and about your website and some of your newest publications.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:53.980]  Sure.
[00:39:54.701 --> 00:40:00.425]  I'm a doctorate in traditional and complementary medicines, and my main emphasis the last 11 years has been
[00:40:01.005 --> 00:40:09.853]  Well, essentially researching new technologies and really documenting the academic research in those areas and then bringing it forward to the public.
[00:40:09.913 --> 00:40:19.000]  I also have worked for a number of years as past president of the Alaska Federation of Teachers for a couple of terms, Anchorage Council of Education for a couple of terms.
[00:40:19.541 --> 00:40:23.504]  I've been active in politics most of my adult life in this part of the world.
[00:40:23.564 --> 00:40:25.246]  My family is totally integrated.
[00:40:25.936 --> 00:40:26.637]  Thank you very much.
[00:40:43.686 --> 00:40:44.106]  Thank you very much.
[00:41:02.201 --> 00:41:19.951]  The niche that we fall into is to educate the public at a time when technology decides which governments are powerful, and as a consequence, within a democratic republic, it's incumbent on all of us to have at least some working knowledge of what these technologies offer and then the challenges and the risks they present as well.
[00:41:20.487 --> 00:41:21.688]  Give us your websites.
[00:41:22.109 --> 00:41:27.633]  The website is earthpulse.com, E-A-R-T-H-P-U-L-S-E dot com.
[00:41:28.094 --> 00:41:31.076]  And that's going under some revisions here over the next several months.
[00:41:31.116 --> 00:41:43.307]  We're actually going to upload on a parallel site that's being funded by the Lay Foundation on Technologies a complete bibliographical index of the first 5,000 records will be uploaded
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:42:02.975]  Later this year, and this includes abstracts, so it'll be a great research tool for folks interested in these issues and something to point politicians, political leaders, and media towards only in the sense that it gives a consolidated batch of materials that can then be looked at more deeply by those really interested in the topic.
[00:42:02.995 --> 00:42:04.316]  So we're pretty excited about that.
[00:42:05.415 --> 00:42:09.156]  And you've also been involved in some of the native affairs.
[00:42:09.436 --> 00:42:09.956]  Absolutely.
[00:42:10.016 --> 00:42:15.758]  I've worked as a tribal administrator here for the last six years.
[00:42:15.778 --> 00:42:26.060]  I currently am doing consulting work for tribal governments here in Alaska, which are sort of the last remnant of sovereigns within the country.
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:30.221]  I mean, the way tribes are viewed nationally on the federal level,
[00:42:30.797 --> 00:42:35.526]  It's as domestic nations, nations within nations, which makes for some pretty unique things.
[00:42:35.586 --> 00:42:43.600]  I mean, here in Alaska, for instance, we're developing our own emergency response plan so that the tribal government, as opposed to the
[00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:46.451]  Other local government would control the emergency.
[00:42:46.471 --> 00:42:48.012]  FEMA issue is exactly right.
[00:42:48.092 --> 00:42:55.817]  So we take control away from other state and national officials and maintain that control at the local level with the tribe.
[00:42:55.937 --> 00:43:03.501]  And just a side issue, there's a lot of clear evidence that your father died via foul play in his plane crash.
[00:43:03.781 --> 00:43:04.301]  Absolutely.
[00:43:04.321 --> 00:43:06.142]  It was the early 70s.
[00:43:06.182 --> 00:43:10.565]  In fact, we're going to be talking about oil and gas, and that was the big topic of the day in those days.
[00:43:11.175 --> 00:43:11.596]  And he was...
[00:43:31.832 --> 00:43:33.453]  Getting into this oil scam.
[00:43:33.913 --> 00:43:36.094]  Let's start right there first.
[00:43:36.314 --> 00:43:40.416]  Out of the gates during that last break, I got you on, talked to you for 60 seconds.
[00:43:40.916 --> 00:43:43.557]  I said, I've got the IMF documents, which of course you're aware of.
[00:43:44.938 --> 00:43:46.599]  They like to create artificial scarcity.
[00:43:46.659 --> 00:43:48.319]  They're not going to let us go to new technologies.
[00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:54.342]  They're going to force our entire savings, everything, because our society is built in a sprawled fashion.
[00:43:54.602 --> 00:43:56.003]  They're going to jack up oil prices.
[00:43:56.063 --> 00:43:57.023]  Peak oil is a scam.
[00:43:57.223 --> 00:43:58.164]  And you said, I agree.
[00:43:58.744 --> 00:44:12.229]  Give us your, from your study of this, and you've been right on the front lines of this for decades, tell us what's going on with peak oil, and now the IMF going, oh yes, oh yes, you're going to be paying $10 a gallon, it's all over, there's no oil left.
[00:44:12.289 --> 00:44:17.971]  Meanwhile, they find giant oil fields on a monthly basis, we've got oil coming out of our ears.
[00:44:18.524 --> 00:44:21.387]  Yeah, you know, here in Alaska there were some studies done back in the 80s.
[00:44:21.487 --> 00:44:23.389]  In fact, you've got to go back even further.
[00:44:23.409 --> 00:44:32.138]  If you go back to the early 70s during the oil embargo and sort of what was happening then, there was huge pressure to build the Trans-Alaska pipeline.
[00:44:32.558 --> 00:44:40.486]  And for those that don't remember, at that time, once it did get completed, it provided 25% of domestic oil consumption.
[00:44:40.925 --> 00:44:42.367]  Huge, huge reserves.
[00:44:42.427 --> 00:44:44.970]  Well, the population in the country didn't support it.
[00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:48.754]  In fact, if it wasn't for the embargo, it would have never passed.
[00:44:48.794 --> 00:44:56.163]  At the same time, indigenous issues here had to be settled because there were disputes on right-of-ways and so on.
[00:44:56.283 --> 00:44:59.066]  So the Native Land Claims Settlement Act passed first.
[00:44:59.676 --> 00:45:06.640]  Which was the biggest transfer of fee-simple property and mineral rights to indigenous ever in the history of the country.
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:08.802]  It was my dad's first piece of legislation.
[00:45:09.302 --> 00:45:14.905]  What that then did is clear the way for a right-of-way to be negotiated and established.
[00:45:15.246 --> 00:45:17.987]  Once it passed the House at the U.S.
[00:45:18.428 --> 00:45:26.773]  House level, it went to the Senate and it was actually passed on a tie vote where Agnew, just before he was thrown out of office, actually was the tiebreaker.
[00:45:27.313 --> 00:45:27.653]  Thank you.
[00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:50.390]  Billion.
[00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:51.591]  It had overrun by 1,800%.
[00:45:51.831 --> 00:45:58.293]  The same is probably going to happen with a trans-Canadian gas line if they actually build it.
[00:45:58.333 --> 00:46:01.734]  The difference is this time the risk will be underwritten by the U.S.
[00:46:01.794 --> 00:46:02.534]  taxpayers.
[00:46:02.554 --> 00:46:04.854]  That's what's being proposed in Congress right now.
[00:46:05.475 --> 00:46:10.016]  The other press is to open up the ANWR and open up some of the oil fields in Alaska.
[00:46:10.603 --> 00:46:20.585]  When Alaska was looked at in the mid-80s, they determined that we actually had more oil and potential reserves than Saudi Arabia, which is always considered, you know, sort of the bellwether.
[00:46:20.625 --> 00:46:21.806]  Now, this is not a secret.
[00:46:21.886 --> 00:46:24.006]  I mean, I have a lot of family in the oil business.
[00:46:24.186 --> 00:46:25.747]  It's in the oil publications.
[00:46:26.047 --> 00:46:35.949]  But the general public doesn't know this, and there's masses of oil in the Gulf of Mexico, in one 600-square-mile area, which is relatively small, folks.
[00:46:36.269 --> 00:46:39.410]  There's more oil than we've used in the oil age.
[00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:55.121]  Now, I mean, just for people that just joined us, simplifying it, the whole peak oil move, the IMF, Rolling Stone magazine, all these little alternative, quote, blogs that we can trust, quote, can trust, are telling us there's no oil, Dr. Baggage.
[00:46:55.202 --> 00:46:55.682]  It's over.
[00:46:55.982 --> 00:46:58.264]  We've got to let them just quadruple prices.
[00:46:58.664 --> 00:47:01.026]  Well, and it's really, it's all about the money.
[00:47:01.147 --> 00:47:03.929]  And there's other parts of it that are bottlenecking the price.
[00:47:04.210 --> 00:47:06.552]  One is refining capacity.
[00:47:06.632 --> 00:47:09.154]  There's not enough refining capacity to meet world demand.
[00:47:09.174 --> 00:47:10.516]  Because they haven't built them on purpose.
[00:47:10.636 --> 00:47:11.196]  That's right.
[00:47:11.336 --> 00:47:17.923]  And China's demand is increasing so dramatically now that it's even sucking up whatever surpluses are available.
[00:47:17.943 --> 00:47:20.465]  And the other big problem is tanker availability.
[00:47:20.585 --> 00:47:22.067]  And this is a huge problem.
[00:47:23.005 --> 00:47:27.530]  Five, six years ago, you could get ten tankers to pick from to ship your oil.
[00:47:27.590 --> 00:47:29.232]  Today, you're lucky to get one or two.
[00:47:29.853 --> 00:47:37.081]  And the double-hull tankers which are now required for domestic oil production and transportation are so far behind
[00:47:37.868 --> 00:47:45.912]  That even if they had enough oil running through all of the systems, they couldn't move it to the refineries if there were enough refineries to accept it.
[00:47:46.052 --> 00:47:49.313]  And so you've got several factors playing into this.
[00:47:49.473 --> 00:47:55.536]  One is the refining capacity, the shipping capacity, and then the artificial ratchet up of oil prices.
[00:47:55.556 --> 00:48:00.138]  So you clearly agree from the evidence, though, there is not a scarcity of in-the-ground oil?
[00:48:00.358 --> 00:48:02.238]  No, I don't believe that for one moment.
[00:48:02.339 --> 00:48:02.759]  In fact...
[00:48:03.709 --> 00:48:13.347]  The reason they're pushing the gas line is to preempt one of the viable alternatives, which is the whole idea of using
[00:48:16.347 --> 00:48:20.869]  Essentially, the newest technology is on fuel cells.
[00:48:21.149 --> 00:48:30.372]  And the idea here is instead of using other materials to, say, crack hydrogen out of water, they want to use natural gas, again, keeping us dependent.
[00:48:31.213 --> 00:48:31.693]  Exactly.
[00:48:31.733 --> 00:48:34.534]  They're controlling the development to the next phase.
[00:48:34.594 --> 00:48:37.115]  It's going to be a fraudulent system.
[00:48:37.515 --> 00:48:37.755]  Right.
[00:48:37.855 --> 00:48:39.336]  I mean, there's other ways to do this.
[00:48:39.376 --> 00:48:46.338]  There's a mineral that's a byproduct of borax production, sodium borohydrate, which acts as a catalyst.
[00:48:46.358 --> 00:49:00.743]  Well, they've now come out with new solar panels that are five times better with very small, unobtrusive panels they could bring to market in the next few years if they wanted to allow us to have it, a solar car that would go 150 miles an hour.
[00:49:01.923 --> 00:49:02.144]  Right.
[00:49:02.284 --> 00:49:03.567]  And who wouldn't buy that?
[00:49:03.607 --> 00:49:06.513]  We don't mean a piece of junk, folks, that goes 30 miles an hour.
[00:49:06.553 --> 00:49:08.196]  We mean a sports car.
[00:49:08.236 --> 00:49:09.018]  We mean a truck.
[00:49:09.702 --> 00:49:16.084]  Well, here's another big consideration that people have not really indexed is superconductivity as a way to transfer energy.
[00:49:16.104 --> 00:49:21.105]  You know, the big problem with producing energy in one location and moving it to another is line loss.
[00:49:21.685 --> 00:49:25.266]  Electricity can't be transmitted, you know, long, long distances.
[00:49:25.786 --> 00:49:34.028]  Yet, when they solve that particular technical problem, which I believe we're going to see in our lifetimes, you can then produce power wherever the energy is located.
[00:49:34.108 --> 00:49:35.849]  So if you look at geothermal as a
[00:49:36.633 --> 00:49:40.214]  Really, for practical purposes, an endless engine of power.
[00:49:40.754 --> 00:49:48.296]  You could produce enough energy on geothermal in Alaska or wind in Alaska to provide enough energy to run the entire United States power grid.
[00:49:48.436 --> 00:49:51.477]  But that decentralizes control so they can't let it happen.
[00:49:51.897 --> 00:49:52.537]  Exactly right.
[00:49:52.657 --> 00:49:55.718]  So they'll finance fake left-wing groups to tell us there's no oil.
[00:49:56.018 --> 00:49:59.259]  Then the neocon-controlled IMF World Bank will tell us there's no oil.
[00:50:00.079 --> 00:50:07.507]  And then people go, look, Dr. Beggins, I have the IMF World Bank documents that BBC reported on almost three years ago.
[00:50:07.907 --> 00:50:16.296]  And it says we're going to create artificial scarcity on fuel, water, everything, and they're doing it now, and the poor, controlled left is buying it.
[00:50:16.616 --> 00:50:17.537]  Well, let me tell you this.
[00:50:17.697 --> 00:50:21.381]  The biggest scam on natural resources in the U.S., including oil and gas...
[00:50:21.735 --> 00:50:32.502]  It was during the Carter administration, and there was a big fight here in Alaska over Section D-2 of the Native Land Claims Act, which allowed for the development of parks and preserves.
[00:50:33.681 --> 00:50:41.303]  And all the big foundations, all the big world leaders punched money into the environmental movement to lock these resources up.
[00:50:41.343 --> 00:50:43.184]  And after the break, I'll tell you what happened with that.
[00:50:43.344 --> 00:50:43.984]  Exactly.
[00:50:44.104 --> 00:50:46.045]  Again, I'm not against the environment.
[00:50:46.085 --> 00:50:47.105]  I'm for the environment.
[00:50:47.405 --> 00:50:53.107]  But they hijacked the environmental movement and used it to set up a neo-futilist plantation.
[00:50:53.507 --> 00:50:54.807]  This is their own documents.
[00:50:55.248 --> 00:50:57.448]  Dr. Bagich is on target as usual.
[00:50:57.928 --> 00:50:59.509]  We'll expose this when we get back.
[00:50:59.529 --> 00:50:59.889]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.221 --> 00:51:05.726]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.906 --> 00:51:10.311]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.471 --> 00:51:14.856]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:14.896 --> 00:51:16.258]  The New World Order.
[00:51:17.038 --> 00:51:17.818]  Panama.
[00:51:18.018 --> 00:51:22.260]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:29.242]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.362 --> 00:51:31.442]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.742 --> 00:51:42.086]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.106 --> 00:51:43.666]  If you want to understand what the new
[00:51:43.786 --> 00:51:44.046]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:44.086 --> 00:51:45.767]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:52:01.534 --> 00:52:04.537]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:52:04.877 --> 00:52:13.704]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:52:14.024 --> 00:52:18.708]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:19.168 --> 00:52:25.895]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:52:26.296 --> 00:52:38.048]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:38.548 --> 00:52:43.012]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:52:43.172 --> 00:52:45.634]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:45.654 --> 00:52:47.496]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:52:47.516 --> 00:52:48.717]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:52:48.777 --> 00:52:50.238]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:52:50.258 --> 00:52:51.319]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:01.997 --> 00:53:07.946]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:08.186 --> 00:53:10.449]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:16.979]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, Colloidal Silver 500 parts per million, Olive Leaf Extract,
[00:53:17.319 --> 00:53:17.979]  We're good to go.
[00:53:39.930 --> 00:53:40.750]  We're good to go.
[00:54:12.268 --> 00:54:19.631]  I know we've had callers calling in since the start of the show, broadcast, and we're going to get to your calls coming up early in the next hour.
[00:54:21.212 --> 00:54:23.073]  You can hang up and call back then if you want.
[00:54:23.093 --> 00:54:28.055]  The lines may not be open then, but 1-800-259-9231 is the number to join us.
[00:54:28.075 --> 00:54:30.616]  Folks, this is just the facts.
[00:54:31.817 --> 00:54:36.239]  Huge oil fields all over Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan.
[00:54:37.216 --> 00:54:41.939]  All over Canada, all over Alaska, all over Mexico, Texas.
[00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:44.080]  It's just everywhere.
[00:54:45.001 --> 00:54:48.823]  I mean, like half the places they drill in Texas, they hit huge oil wells or gas wells.
[00:54:48.903 --> 00:54:49.764]  It's a joke.
[00:54:50.705 --> 00:54:52.086]  There's oil everywhere.
[00:54:53.006 --> 00:54:56.748]  But it's like De Beers and the Oppenheimers with diamonds.
[00:54:57.269 --> 00:55:01.632]  Diamonds are semi-precious, but they're the most precious stone because they have a monopoly.
[00:55:02.232 --> 00:55:03.773]  And the IMF says it in their own documents.
[00:55:04.372 --> 00:55:10.397]  They'd rather sell you one gallon of water for three or four times what it's worth than just sell it to you at regular price.
[00:55:10.417 --> 00:55:12.479]  Because it also brings control.
[00:55:12.499 --> 00:55:15.742]  And that's part of this consolidation.
[00:55:15.882 --> 00:55:23.348]  Dr. Baggett, you said it before we hit the break that this is a way to scam the public.
[00:55:23.408 --> 00:55:24.029]  And you mentioned...
[00:55:24.668 --> 00:55:31.332]  How the big foundations, the big money men actually funded these big preserves has nothing to do with the environment.
[00:55:31.853 --> 00:55:43.080]  It was totally about getting control of those resources because by locking resources up, that means the other resources they own and control automatically increase in price, correct?
[00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:43.821]  Absolutely.
[00:55:43.861 --> 00:55:46.883]  The other thing it does is create a long-term sort of...
[00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:50.922]  Inventory they don't have to pay for, because here's what happens.
[00:55:50.942 --> 00:56:08.578]  When they locked up all these resources in Alaska, Carter also looked at where the strategic minerals were in the country, and 32 of the 33 strategic minerals, including things like tungsten, platinum, palladium, all of these very, very important minerals exist in mineable quantities in Alaska.
[00:56:08.598 --> 00:56:12.101]  They were locked up within the boundaries of most of these major preserves.
[00:56:12.941 --> 00:56:25.246]  What happened is groups like the Rockefeller Foundation, Ford Foundation, and others funded the environmental groups to make the campaign to lock up literally millions and millions of acres here in Alaska.
[00:56:25.366 --> 00:56:38.411]  As a consequence, in national emergencies, what you'll see happen over time is when we get thrown out of Africa or wherever we're exploiting these resources presently, you'll see the pressure to open these reserves up.
[00:56:38.471 --> 00:56:42.032]  And as simple as an executive order can bust open some of these
[00:56:43.113 --> 00:56:44.013]  Parks and Preserves.
[00:56:44.054 --> 00:56:45.535]  And then it's given to select people.
[00:56:45.595 --> 00:56:49.278]  Look at the small fields they allow to be developed in Alaska.
[00:56:49.638 --> 00:56:52.140]  As you said, giving 25% of our domestic use.
[00:56:52.781 --> 00:56:54.262]  What is it, like half of Japan's?
[00:56:55.163 --> 00:56:59.447]  BP almost owns and controls all of that, and they were just given it by our government.
[00:56:59.827 --> 00:57:00.027]  Yep.
[00:57:00.147 --> 00:57:05.032]  In fact, British Petroleum, I was one of three litigants filing an antitrust suit.
[00:57:05.072 --> 00:57:06.333]  The first antitrust suit...
[00:57:06.853 --> 00:57:18.195]  When Atlantic Richfield tried to sell all of their resources to British Petroleum, which, when the oil field first opened, 25% of British Petroleum was owned by the British Crown.
[00:57:18.235 --> 00:57:23.517]  I mean, we thought we had gotten rid of colonialization, and all we did is do it through a corporate structure.
[00:57:23.637 --> 00:57:35.299]  And the thing that happened here is after we filed suit, and it was myself as an independent, we had someone that was one of our signers to our state constitution, who's a prominent Democrat and then a prominent Republican,
[00:57:35.779 --> 00:57:39.402]  In fact, the chairman of the Republican Moderate Party and the three of us joined together.
[00:57:39.522 --> 00:57:45.967]  We blocked the merger long enough for the Western states to get involved and eventually kill it.
[00:57:46.287 --> 00:57:47.368]  Had it not happened,
[00:57:47.887 --> 00:57:56.852]  Something like 80% of all Alaskan oil and gas, as far as the producing oil and gas, would have been controlled by a foreign corporation whose interest... And again, that's not free market.
[00:57:56.912 --> 00:58:01.595]  That's this crony capitalism or criminal... It's not free market.
[00:58:01.735 --> 00:58:02.475]  It's a racket.
[00:58:02.535 --> 00:58:10.900]  Now we've got these, quote, liberals we can trust who are out pushing the population control agenda right along with peak oil.
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:13.361]  I mean, that's right out of Rockefeller Brothers Foundation.
[00:58:14.061 --> 00:58:14.662]  Absolutely.
[00:58:14.962 --> 00:58:23.286]  And when you look at what is the pressure point and what does this do, wait until you see what happens to inflation figures when they catch up.
[00:58:23.346 --> 00:58:24.607]  And that's a few months away.
[00:58:25.047 --> 00:58:27.828]  Wait until you see what happens to producer production costs.
[00:58:28.329 --> 00:58:32.431]  We are going to see a very strong downturn in this economy as a result of all of this.
[00:58:32.771 --> 00:58:36.594]  But they'll keep telling us the economy's great so people will feel like they're all alone.
[00:58:36.915 --> 00:58:38.636]  Doing bad, they'll buy the propaganda.
[00:58:38.976 --> 00:58:40.277]  Yep, and that's what's happening now.
[00:58:40.658 --> 00:58:43.160]  We'll be right back with Dr. Nick Begich in the second hour.
[00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:46.623]  We'll cover a bunch of other key issues and take your calls.
[00:58:46.683 --> 00:58:47.203]  Stay with us.
[00:58:57.652 --> 00:58:58.253]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.926 --> 00:58:59.987]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.707 --> 00:59:01.788]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.448 --> 00:59:03.309]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.049 --> 00:59:04.910]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.930 --> 00:59:09.292]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.792 --> 00:59:13.935]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.976 --> 00:59:17.137]  All right, we're now into hour number two.
[00:59:17.157 --> 00:59:19.278]  If you missed the last hour, oh my goodness.
[00:59:19.838 --> 00:59:23.641]  Welcome to Dr. Nick Bagich of EarthPulse.com.
[00:59:25.894 --> 00:59:34.416]  And he is an expert on basically analyzing the technologies, the real technological developments out there.
[00:59:34.876 --> 00:59:39.137]  We just spent the last 30 minutes talking about the peak oil scam.
[00:59:40.697 --> 00:59:42.798]  Masses of untapped oil everywhere.
[00:59:44.158 --> 00:59:50.319]  But the globalists want to create artificial scarcity as an economic tool of control.
[00:59:51.079 --> 00:59:54.180]  And coming up in the next segment, we're going to start taking your calls
[00:59:55.663 --> 00:59:57.124]  At 1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:57.144 --> 01:00:16.196]  But Dr. Baggett, continuing with what you mentioned about inflation, the inflationary pressures of, you know, when gas prices are this high, as you know well, it affects an entire food chain of the economy.
[01:00:17.077 --> 01:00:20.058]  And causes prices to go up across the board.
[01:00:20.098 --> 01:00:20.999]  Can you speak more to that?
[01:00:21.259 --> 01:00:22.959]  Yeah, there's a couple things.
[01:00:23.159 --> 01:00:34.624]  Firstly, because you think about energy as a component for food production, literally food production, you look at energy as a component for everything that's produced, and it adds a significant amount to inflation.
[01:00:34.664 --> 01:00:41.526]  I would expect within the next 18 months to see us starting to get back into this potentially double-digit.
[01:00:41.586 --> 01:00:43.107]  Now, some of the things that they're doing
[01:00:43.567 --> 01:00:57.340]  To mitigate this, reducing trade barriers even further, just to create this sort of artificial slide in prices as foreign competitors are able to bring goods in even cheaper, textile industry is one in particular that they're looking at right now.
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:08.430]  So what you have is baubles, symbols of success being sold very cheaply, but key things like milk and fuel and housing, real indices are exploding in price.
[01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:09.150]  Absolutely.
[01:01:09.171 --> 01:01:13.274]  The things that affect people that don't have any elasticity, any room in their budgets.
[01:01:13.314 --> 01:01:26.984]  I mean, when gas goes to $3 a gallon, and in some parts of the country it's getting pretty close to that now, that has a huge effect on low and moderate income earners, which is the bulk of the people left in the United States.
[01:01:27.024 --> 01:01:27.644]  Are you kidding?
[01:01:28.245 --> 01:01:29.746]  It's not comfortable for me to be...
[01:01:30.433 --> 01:01:32.674]  Paying $40 at the pump instead of $25.
[01:01:32.754 --> 01:01:33.315]  Exactly.
[01:01:33.395 --> 01:01:36.236]  And what it causes is other choices to be made.
[01:01:36.276 --> 01:01:37.837]  It starts to draw out savings.
[01:01:38.517 --> 01:01:41.719]  It really weakens the individual tremendously.
[01:01:41.739 --> 01:01:43.480]  But it consolidates control.
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:44.381]  Absolutely.
[01:01:44.401 --> 01:01:51.164]  It gives the power into the hands of those who control, literally, the flow of resources to households.
[01:01:51.244 --> 01:01:53.926]  Because no longer do households produce much of anything.
[01:01:55.567 --> 01:02:10.736]  I mean, we've gone from a society and a culture that essentially was self-sustaining and efficient as individuals to one totally dependent on multinational corporations that control the flow of goods, services, and all the things that we consider important.
[01:02:10.896 --> 01:02:23.119]  And even the service economy that they promised would be the holy grail and save us as we, quote, de-industrialize, now that's shutting down, and everything is shifting to homeland security with the college courses.
[01:02:23.179 --> 01:02:24.579]  It's shifting to the private prisons.
[01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:26.960]  It's shifting to being security guards.
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:28.580]  Everything is shifting.
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:30.821]  They're almost forcing us into the police state.
[01:02:31.221 --> 01:02:37.167]  Well, and even in that area, you know, college enrollments aren't going up the way they expected.
[01:02:37.187 --> 01:02:41.090]  The ability to fund college has gone down, so we're ending up now.
[01:02:41.370 --> 01:02:44.133]  At the same time, the college prices are going up.
[01:02:44.293 --> 01:02:46.455]  Yeah, and so what are they doing to combat that?
[01:02:46.515 --> 01:02:55.924]  They're lowering, again, restrictions on immigration to allow technical folks to come into the country and take those jobs that, you know, in the past, those high-paying jobs went to Americans.
[01:02:55.984 --> 01:02:57.305]  Now they're not so high-paying.
[01:02:57.585 --> 01:02:57.905]  I think so.
[01:03:06.152 --> 01:03:11.855]  You know, that's just the continuing shift of goods and services out of the hands of individuals.
[01:03:11.895 --> 01:03:14.776]  I mean, that's what these lockups in Alaska were about.
[01:03:14.796 --> 01:03:25.242]  You know, on the minerals side, not the oil and gas side, but on the minerals side, any American citizen could go out and stake claims on these federal lands and actually gain possession of those resources.
[01:03:25.342 --> 01:03:28.904]  No longer will that ever be possible within these parks and preserves.
[01:03:28.944 --> 01:03:32.926]  It will only happen for multinational corporations whose interests aren't our own.
[01:03:33.166 --> 01:03:34.588]  And again, that was free market.
[01:03:34.628 --> 01:03:36.330]  You could go out and stake a claim to it.
[01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:40.695]  Now, it is centralized, not free market, but they call it free market.
[01:03:40.955 --> 01:03:42.697]  Yep, it's a monopoly is what it is.
[01:03:42.857 --> 01:03:43.858]  Monopoly.
[01:03:43.878 --> 01:03:45.019]  Simplify it very well.
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:48.503]  We'll be right back and talk a lot more about this and more and your call.
[01:03:48.523 --> 01:03:48.964]  Stay with us.
[01:03:53.183 --> 01:03:54.704]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:54.904 --> 01:03:57.986]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:58.126 --> 01:04:02.028]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:02.088 --> 01:04:06.310]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:04:06.651 --> 01:04:10.413]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:10.573 --> 01:04:12.374]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:12.974 --> 01:04:15.876]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[01:04:15.916 --> 01:04:20.620]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:23.822]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:24.002 --> 01:04:26.864]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:27.364 --> 01:04:33.469]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:34.009 --> 01:04:34.709]  We're good to go.
[01:04:34.729 --> 01:04:35.230]  We're good to go.
[01:04:52.518 --> 01:04:54.179]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:04:54.199 --> 01:04:56.701]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path.
[01:05:20.639 --> 01:05:20.839]  I think?
[01:05:50.401 --> 01:05:50.831]  We're good.
[01:05:52.083 --> 01:05:53.784]  Soon the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[01:05:53.964 --> 01:05:55.965]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[01:05:56.165 --> 01:05:56.846]  Prepare yourself.
[01:05:57.026 --> 01:06:00.728]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.

[01:06:10.973 --> 01:06:12.534]  We just want to make sure you know the truth.
[01:06:12.854 --> 01:06:15.636]  Get your free book The Bible Says by calling toll-free 888-211-1715.
[01:06:15.676 --> 01:06:16.436]  Again, that's 888-211-1715.
[01:06:22.003 --> 01:06:22.443]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:06:57.627 --> 01:06:58.267]  Big Brother.
[01:06:58.928 --> 01:06:59.988]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.709 --> 01:07:01.830]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:03.310]  You want answers?
[01:07:03.330 --> 01:07:04.932]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:04.952 --> 01:07:09.294]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.795 --> 01:07:13.917]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:15.578 --> 01:07:20.301]  All right, eight minutes, 25 seconds into this second hour on this Monday edition.
[01:07:21.502 --> 01:07:24.164]  Talking to Dr. Nick Begich of EarthPulse.com.
[01:07:25.948 --> 01:07:28.469]  He's an author, documentary maker, professor.
[01:07:30.350 --> 01:07:32.331]  His father, of course, was a famous congressman.
[01:07:34.051 --> 01:07:35.392]  The evidence is clear.
[01:07:35.452 --> 01:07:40.674]  A foul play involved in his plane crash, his plane going down with the leader of the House.
[01:07:43.035 --> 01:07:46.516]  And that concerned energy as well, the energy scams that are going on.
[01:07:46.536 --> 01:07:50.918]  In the last 40 minutes, we've been talking about the peak oil scams.
[01:07:51.579 --> 01:08:04.803]  Telling you that we've run out of oil as they have all these giant reserves everywhere and they've handed them over to private select corporations that are in cahoots with OPEC deciding not to tap them because it would drive prices down to almost nothing.
[01:08:05.403 --> 01:08:06.564]  But it's just like with the diamonds.
[01:08:06.604 --> 01:08:13.366]  They've created artificial scarcity and now they've got their fake grassroots organizations out there promoting this.
[01:08:14.153 --> 01:08:15.674]  Full tilt boogie right now.
[01:08:16.374 --> 01:08:21.557]  Adding the cherry on top of we've got to reduce world population drastically.
[01:08:22.077 --> 01:08:28.761]  And now the IMF, of course, is out promoting what their little minions have already been pushing for them.
[01:08:29.001 --> 01:08:30.342]  Those that have been laying the groundwork.
[01:08:30.902 --> 01:08:32.663]  Yes, there'll be no resources.
[01:08:34.068 --> 01:08:43.954]  And so now that they've gotten this monopoly of control, they're going to start gouging you for energy, gouging you when you travel with toll roads on every major street and highway and state road.
[01:08:45.335 --> 01:08:51.499]  They're going to start forced psychological testing, forced drugging, with the drug companies actually administering it in the schools.
[01:08:52.059 --> 01:08:59.164]  This is the transfer of, quote, privatization, where the corporations that are bigger than most governments become the governments.
[01:09:00.544 --> 01:09:08.768]  And just like you've got fake blogs out there, you know, with Jeff Gannon and Talon News Service and fake news reporters like Armstrong Williams.
[01:09:10.549 --> 01:09:13.751]  It's just there's so much of this out there, and it's got to be fought.
[01:09:14.071 --> 01:09:15.071]  It's got to be resisted.
[01:09:15.091 --> 01:09:19.994]  And when you watch the mainstream news, there's little or no discussion of why we're paying so much for oil.
[01:09:20.954 --> 01:09:28.918]  It's because they've laid off limits all of our own reserves in the Gulf of Mexico and all over this country and Canada and predominantly Alaska.
[01:09:31.031 --> 01:09:43.414]  And they are basically not upgrading the systems, the delivery systems, by design, their own documents say it, but still the general public is in the dark, and many of you are buying the fraud.
[01:09:43.894 --> 01:09:47.154]  I've studied it, I've looked at it, and it is a scam.
[01:09:47.194 --> 01:09:54.956]  But I want to go to your calls here in just a minute or two, as promised, but Dr. Nick Baggett will tell folks how to get your books and the videos as well.
[01:09:55.276 --> 01:10:00.357]  What are some of the other issues that you think are really important right now that we should discuss?
[01:10:01.098 --> 01:10:07.620]  Let's jump just one more point on the oil that is important that we missed, and that's what oil does in terms of U.S.
[01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:08.461]  money supply.
[01:10:08.701 --> 01:10:12.682]  It used to be all oil was traded globally in dollars, and that has changed.
[01:10:12.842 --> 01:10:14.883]  Now they take euros and other currencies.
[01:10:15.487 --> 01:10:22.911]  As a consequence, there's more dollars in circulation, which causes the value of those dollars to drop unless they get sucked up by higher oil prices.
[01:10:22.931 --> 01:10:24.472]  So that's part of the scam as well.
[01:10:24.552 --> 01:10:30.996]  Well, that's what I said before you got on with us, is the dollar's been devalued by 45% in the last four years, so we're going to have to pay more.
[01:10:31.296 --> 01:10:32.997]  Yeah, and that's exactly what's happened.
[01:10:33.017 --> 01:10:36.379]  I mean, I do a lot of work in Europe where the impact of this is extreme.
[01:10:37.319 --> 01:10:38.680]  It's great for shipping U.S.
[01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:41.623]  goods over, but try and get anything out of Europe headed this way.
[01:10:41.803 --> 01:10:43.164]  It's just outrageous.
[01:10:43.444 --> 01:10:45.826]  And you just can't do it the way you used to be able to.
[01:10:45.846 --> 01:10:48.909]  Again, it's designed to hurt first world countries.
[01:10:48.949 --> 01:10:53.192]  And then I hear the phony left on NPR going, good, we've lived out of our means.
[01:10:53.473 --> 01:10:54.513]  This will teach us.
[01:10:54.834 --> 01:10:57.076]  No, this won't make us independent.
[01:10:57.116 --> 01:10:58.717]  This will make us more dependent.
[01:10:58.997 --> 01:11:02.760]  Yeah, there's one other twist on this to kind of jump a little bit to a side issue.
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:08.144]  You know, they're just revamping the bankruptcy laws, and I think people have been following this a little bit.
[01:11:08.344 --> 01:11:19.193]  The bankruptcy laws were set up when we had indentured servitude, and they kind of got rid of that and said, you know, people need a chance to have a fresh start and be able to clear all of that out.
[01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:27.353]  If you think about all the credit card solicitations and what's happened is people have racked up huge, huge debt and continue to do so.
[01:11:27.553 --> 01:11:32.236]  And they used to be able, if they got out of control, to be able to shut it down and start over.
[01:11:32.256 --> 01:11:34.657]  Well, you can't do that under the new legislation.
[01:11:34.717 --> 01:11:40.780]  What will happen is you'll be an indentured servant to those creditors.
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:44.322]  Even if you have like a family illness where you get sick, you can't work.
[01:11:44.362 --> 01:11:45.983]  They're going to start garnishing.
[01:11:46.403 --> 01:11:50.365]  Yeah, they're going to take away and eliminate your ability to clear it.
[01:11:50.385 --> 01:12:02.391]  So if you have a sick breadwinner in the house that loses everything, or you get in an accident, you can't work for a period of time, you are going to be enslaved and never have a chance to start again.
[01:12:02.512 --> 01:12:04.533]  And again, it's neo-feudalism.
[01:12:04.553 --> 01:12:06.033]  I'm so glad you brought this up, Doctor.
[01:12:06.674 --> 01:12:08.975]  Back when I was in college and had absolutely no money,
[01:12:09.691 --> 01:12:11.692]  I would get a credit card almost every day in the mail.
[01:12:11.792 --> 01:12:16.014]  Now that I'm out of debt and have a little bit of money, I maybe get one a month or so.
[01:12:16.355 --> 01:12:17.515]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:12:17.575 --> 01:12:18.656]  And you know, what happens?
[01:12:18.736 --> 01:12:25.719]  I mean, when you think about... Listen, I had a credit card that I always paid off each month, and they canceled it and said, you're not good for us.
[01:12:25.779 --> 01:12:26.320]  And I called them.
[01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:30.342]  They said, well, Mr. Jones, we have a little index we do, and you're not profitable for us.
[01:12:30.742 --> 01:12:32.043]  Oh, my gosh.
[01:12:33.003 --> 01:12:44.692]  Well, you know, when you think about all of this, I think about, I had a friend of mine who visited me from the former Soviet Union and he was marveling as we drove through the neighborhoods of my community at the houses.
[01:12:44.852 --> 01:12:48.194]  And I said, look, nobody owns these houses but the bank.
[01:12:48.494 --> 01:12:54.018]  And he looked at me just mystified, you know, because in the former Soviet Union, when somebody says they own their home, they really do.
[01:12:54.839 --> 01:12:56.120]  You know, they don't owe anything on it.
[01:12:56.861 --> 01:13:05.409]  And when I explained to him how much of a payment goes to interest versus really paying for the house and explained to him what that was, it's a banker's tax.
[01:13:05.569 --> 01:13:08.612]  It's a way to keep us enslaved economically.
[01:13:08.632 --> 01:13:09.473]  And let's be clear.
[01:13:10.013 --> 01:13:13.356]  When they create a credit card, that's just zeros and ones in a computer.
[01:13:13.396 --> 01:13:15.378]  It's all fractional reserve banking.
[01:13:15.639 --> 01:13:18.561]  These banks, they're allowed in more complex scenarios.
[01:13:18.861 --> 01:13:20.343]  They do write this stuff off.
[01:13:20.839 --> 01:13:27.428]  Yeah, and here's what they're doing with the new bankruptcy rules, where they're already charging you 18% or 22% interest.
[01:13:27.468 --> 01:13:29.171]  In some cases, 30%.
[01:13:29.511 --> 01:13:34.758]  Yeah, and then they're sucking up a certain amount of losses, which they factor in, which is their excuse for those high rates.
[01:13:35.219 --> 01:13:36.341]  You put this into play.
[01:13:36.963 --> 01:13:37.943]  I think we're good to go.
[01:13:59.418 --> 01:14:02.439]  Well, listen, I saw Governor Ridge, and folks, again, these people are not free market.
[01:14:02.459 --> 01:14:03.299]  It's about control.
[01:14:03.319 --> 01:14:06.539]  They own the world, now they're getting rid of the middle class that threatens them.
[01:14:06.559 --> 01:14:08.040]  Their own documents say it.
[01:14:28.866 --> 01:14:30.507]  I saw Reg almost three years ago.
[01:14:31.648 --> 01:14:32.248]  He's left now.
[01:14:32.288 --> 01:14:33.129]  Now it's Chertoff.
[01:14:33.209 --> 01:14:34.730]  Michael Chertoff is Homeland Security head.
[01:14:35.050 --> 01:14:42.475]  But I saw him on C-SPAN, and he said, if you've got bad credit, you're going to have a bad rating on your national ID card through the driver's license, which they've now done.
[01:14:42.495 --> 01:14:47.078]  And just like with the TSA, they're now changing the name to confuse you.
[01:14:47.979 --> 01:14:51.220]  Just like with the airports, daily life is going to be like that.
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:15:07.223]  And then if you want to be able to have a job, you're going to have to go dedicate yourself 10 hours a week working for the corporation they direct you to, literally as a slave laborer, to pay off your debts or they won't remove that hold off your ID card.
[01:15:07.403 --> 01:15:08.183]  Were you aware of that?
[01:15:08.603 --> 01:15:08.823]  Yep.
[01:15:08.943 --> 01:15:14.564]  And, you know, this is, again, when people talk about New World Order politics and controls,
[01:15:15.124 --> 01:15:16.185]  It is all about that.
[01:15:16.225 --> 01:15:23.389]  I mean, if you take it the next step, even currency, they're going to be embedding chips in currency so they can track every dollar.
[01:15:23.969 --> 01:15:29.512]  In other words, there won't be any more cash economy, essentially.
[01:15:29.553 --> 01:15:32.934]  I mean, you'll be trading with what's as trackable as a credit card transaction.
[01:15:32.954 --> 01:15:34.335]  And they've been saying they're going to do that.
[01:15:34.776 --> 01:15:44.021]  Yeah, and actually, the projection is by 2008, 2009, the technology will be cheap enough to accomplish it because these will be able to be embedded into the fabric
[01:15:44.501 --> 01:15:44.701]  And then
[01:16:06.857 --> 01:16:07.398]  Black box.
[01:16:23.573 --> 01:16:27.137]  The black box, tracking every time you buckle up, every time you speed.
[01:16:27.157 --> 01:16:32.744]  You know what's going to happen eventually is the laws are going to allow for our own safety, which is always the... It's already here.
[01:16:32.985 --> 01:16:33.605]  It's already here.
[01:16:34.046 --> 01:16:34.246]  Yep.
[01:16:34.607 --> 01:16:36.789]  And you're not going to be able to buy insurance.
[01:16:37.090 --> 01:16:38.031]  They've got the bill.
[01:16:38.091 --> 01:16:40.514]  The Texas insurance lobby's got the bill introduced.
[01:16:40.894 --> 01:16:40.994]  Yep.
[01:16:58.641 --> 01:16:59.142]  Yep.
[01:16:59.242 --> 01:17:08.990]  And when you tie all this together, what it really results in is an absolute directive and controlled society, which is something that we've been talking about for years.
[01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:11.733]  I know, Alex, you've been talking about this since your beginnings.
[01:17:11.833 --> 01:17:12.794]  I mean, this is really the...
[01:17:13.655 --> 01:17:15.176]  This is where the rubber meets the road.
[01:17:15.217 --> 01:17:19.941]  I mean, we're talking about... Yeah, ten years ago I was reading their documents, you were reading their documents, now it's happening.
[01:17:20.121 --> 01:17:29.250]  Yep, and in fact, if you look back historically on some of the projections by the think tankers on the planet, one in particular, I know I've mentioned on your program before, and it's...
[01:17:30.010 --> 01:17:33.374]  The Big New Brzezinski's Between Two Ages, written in the early 70s.
[01:17:33.494 --> 01:17:34.896]  And you can still find this book.
[01:17:34.956 --> 01:17:36.838]  They printed a couple hundred thousand of them.
[01:17:36.858 --> 01:17:39.441]  And that was the genesis and the idea for the Trilateral Commission.
[01:17:39.501 --> 01:17:40.783]  Rockefeller said, I read this book.
[01:17:41.203 --> 01:17:41.403]  Yep.
[01:17:41.604 --> 01:17:45.508]  And if you look at that book as a projection, because it's from the 70s, over 30 years ago,
[01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:52.058]  You read it today, and it is a history of the socio-economic and cultural changes that took place.
[01:17:52.098 --> 01:17:52.679]  And it shows.
[01:17:52.739 --> 01:17:53.580]  They're the engineers.
[01:17:53.620 --> 01:17:54.902]  We'll read the Grand Chessboard.
[01:17:54.922 --> 01:17:57.426]  97, it's exactly what happened.
[01:17:57.646 --> 01:17:58.608]  Yeah, exactly right.
[01:17:58.688 --> 01:18:01.492]  And so when you look at it, and you've got to take a long view.
[01:18:02.433 --> 01:18:07.977]  Everyone thinks Wall Street just takes to quarterly view, and they do for generating the jack-up of profit parties.
[01:18:08.017 --> 01:18:09.198]  Yeah, for milking the saps.
[01:18:09.338 --> 01:18:17.843]  Yeah, but when you look at the long-range view, it's about moving massive resources into the control of the few.
[01:18:18.424 --> 01:18:19.144]  You can go back.
[01:18:19.504 --> 01:18:22.406]  If you think the railroad baron stories of the 1800s were something...
[01:18:23.587 --> 01:18:28.831]  The minerals and resource stories of this century and the last one dwarfs what happened then.
[01:18:28.972 --> 01:18:34.096]  And they've got fake alternative left control bloggers out there telling us it's all good.
[01:18:34.636 --> 01:18:35.177]  Absolutely.
[01:18:35.397 --> 01:18:36.277]  We're in deep trouble.
[01:18:36.578 --> 01:18:37.138]  I promise.
[01:18:37.178 --> 01:18:38.800]  We'll go right to your calls when we get back.
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:41.222]  That Texas bill, looks like it may pass.
[01:18:41.422 --> 01:18:41.742]  HB 2893.
[01:18:42.062 --> 01:18:43.203]  Transponders in all our cars by law.
[01:18:43.223 --> 01:18:44.284]  $3,855 tax per year.
[01:18:44.304 --> 01:18:44.484]  Starting.
[01:18:44.504 --> 01:18:44.985]  We'll be back.
[01:18:53.465 --> 01:18:57.066]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[01:18:57.386 --> 01:19:00.907]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.

[01:19:54.076 --> 01:19:57.079]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:06.249]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:20:06.569 --> 01:20:11.254]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:20:11.714 --> 01:20:18.439]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:20:18.839 --> 01:20:30.608]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:20:31.088 --> 01:20:35.552]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[01:20:42.817 --> 01:20:43.858]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:20:53.991 --> 01:20:59.513]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[01:20:59.673 --> 01:21:00.734]  You wear deodorant, right?
[01:21:00.854 --> 01:21:01.714]  Well, let's hope you do.
[01:21:01.834 --> 01:21:04.675]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[01:21:04.855 --> 01:21:09.737]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?

[01:21:11.238 --> 01:21:14.139]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[01:21:14.499 --> 01:21:18.201]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[01:21:18.361 --> 01:21:18.501]  Look.
[01:21:18.701 --> 01:21:21.004]  The creator of Nobio understands what you're going through.

[01:21:29.453 --> 01:21:33.518]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin.
[01:21:33.658 --> 01:21:37.822]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.

[01:21:56.537 --> 01:22:03.923]  On February 29, 1892, the United States of America's Supreme Court declared us a Christian nation.
[01:22:05.024 --> 01:22:14.712]  However, over recent years, for the last three decades, there's been a deliberate war on Christianity in America to wipe out our heritage from the minds of our people.
[01:22:15.593 --> 01:22:22.198]  The First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees us religious freedom, and yet it's under attack today.
[01:22:23.149 --> 01:22:31.991]  We would like to send you a one-year absolutely free subscription to Newswatch Magazine that gives you the background of what is happening in America.

[01:23:03.482 --> 01:23:05.523]  I really appreciate Dr. Begich joining us.
[01:23:05.683 --> 01:23:08.444]  Coming up in the next segment, we're going to plug some of his incredible materials.
[01:23:09.024 --> 01:23:09.864]  So get ready for that.
[01:23:11.264 --> 01:23:13.125]  He's going to be with us until the middle of the next hour.
[01:23:13.145 --> 01:23:23.367]  We're going to get into earthquake weapons, patented government devices, stuff he's been talking about for a long time that's now mainstream news.
[01:23:24.028 --> 01:23:29.109]  But right now, we're going to take your calls this segment and throughout the next segment for those that have been holding for eons.
[01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:37.597]  People that know me on the street go, Alex, you're so calm, you know, at a restaurant or, you know, at the mall or in a grocery store.
[01:23:37.637 --> 01:23:39.198]  Why do you get so upset on air?
[01:23:39.518 --> 01:23:41.440]  Because I hate seeing you get scammed.
[01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:42.501]  And I'm getting scammed.
[01:23:42.541 --> 01:23:44.583]  And my children are going to be scammed.
[01:23:44.603 --> 01:23:48.446]  I mean, being ripped off should make you angry by a bunch of criminals.
[01:23:50.188 --> 01:23:51.629]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike.
[01:23:52.427 --> 01:23:54.389]  And Mike, where are you calling us from today?
[01:23:54.789 --> 01:23:55.730]  North Carolina, Alex.
[01:23:55.850 --> 01:23:56.130]  Welcome.
[01:23:56.150 --> 01:23:56.711]  You're on the air.
[01:23:57.191 --> 01:23:57.631]  Thank you.
[01:23:58.052 --> 01:24:06.078]  First, I just wanted to say that I really enjoy what you've been doing and opening many Americans' eyes on what's really going on behind these lies.
[01:24:07.019 --> 01:24:21.291]  And I just wanted to know, since you're a Christian like me and I'm sure many other listeners, do you believe that with this world that is heavily influenced by Satan and his demons that we should just put our trust
[01:24:24.711 --> 01:24:30.097]  Well, look, you reap what you sow.
[01:24:31.118 --> 01:24:33.461]  And, you know, faith without works is dead.
[01:24:33.481 --> 01:24:37.305]  I mean, I could sit here and... I mean, did Jesus lay around and let the corruption go on?
[01:24:37.325 --> 01:24:38.907]  No, he went and confronted it.
[01:24:39.685 --> 01:24:42.046]  And, you know, I'm not a Buddhist, but let's talk about Gandhi.
[01:24:42.066 --> 01:24:46.007]  You know, first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[01:24:46.768 --> 01:24:54.050]  But the old Bedouin saying, trust in God, but tie up your camel, or God helps those that help themselves.
[01:24:54.591 --> 01:25:01.673]  I mean, we've got to, in Ezekiel, dig in the wall, dig through the wall, and look at what's going on inside and tell the people.
[01:25:02.054 --> 01:25:05.855]  We have a moral responsibility to expose and fight evil.
[01:25:07.503 --> 01:25:08.564]  Dr. Begich, comments?
[01:25:09.304 --> 01:25:11.586]  I absolutely agree with you.
[01:25:13.388 --> 01:25:15.209]  You really have to act.
[01:25:15.489 --> 01:25:20.493]  When I was younger and was struggling with the issues of faith, the whole concept of faith came up.
[01:25:20.954 --> 01:25:23.616]  I heard all these long dissertations about what it was.
[01:25:24.256 --> 01:25:26.278]  For me, it boiled down to something very simple.
[01:25:26.378 --> 01:25:30.821]  Faith is knowing what is right and true and acting on it, doing something about it.
[01:25:31.002 --> 01:25:33.163]  I think that's the call that all of us are called to.
[01:25:34.677 --> 01:25:39.882]  What we do if we stand idly by, God gave us free will and creative power to do something with.
[01:25:39.922 --> 01:25:45.027]  We're created in the image of the Creator to spread something that's much more potent than the energy of ourselves.
[01:25:45.047 --> 01:25:48.610]  And that requires action, not idleness.
[01:25:48.650 --> 01:25:53.435]  And I think the call to Americans and to everyone in the world of faith is
[01:25:54.284 --> 01:25:59.167]  Open your eyes and act on what you know to be right and true in the ways that we can.
[01:25:59.227 --> 01:26:00.708]  Don't create a bunch of anxiety.
[01:26:00.768 --> 01:26:01.969]  Do what's right in front of you.
[01:26:02.169 --> 01:26:03.349]  Act on those small things.
[01:26:03.389 --> 01:26:04.510]  They become big things.
[01:26:05.010 --> 01:26:06.972]  There is an inorganic Internet.
[01:26:07.052 --> 01:26:08.272]  It's called the human race.
[01:26:08.292 --> 01:26:12.375]  The creative capacity of God rests there if we direct it in the proper way.
[01:26:12.735 --> 01:26:13.816]  Oh, beautifully said.
[01:26:13.836 --> 01:26:15.096]  And listen, folks.
[01:26:15.597 --> 01:26:17.578]  The Founding Fathers said this over and over again.
[01:26:18.098 --> 01:26:19.059]  Duty is ours.
[01:26:19.159 --> 01:26:20.299]  Consequences is God's.
[01:26:20.699 --> 01:26:22.380]  It doesn't matter if we're going to win.
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:24.301]  Stop worrying about all that.
[01:26:24.401 --> 01:26:26.622]  We have a job to expose corruption.
[01:26:26.642 --> 01:26:28.503]  I mean, it's simple.
[01:26:28.543 --> 01:26:31.984]  That's an instinctive drive to fight corruption, to fight evil.
[01:26:33.345 --> 01:26:35.526]  They're trying to engineer it out of us.
[01:26:36.326 --> 01:26:38.387]  I totally understand what you're saying, Alex.
[01:26:39.002 --> 01:26:41.023]  And I don't disagree with you at all.
[01:26:41.043 --> 01:26:43.304]  The mainline churches are saying cop out.
[01:26:43.605 --> 01:26:44.565]  Don't get involved.
[01:26:44.905 --> 01:26:46.606]  You know, just sit around.
[01:26:46.846 --> 01:26:47.387]  Rejoice!
[01:26:47.427 --> 01:26:48.247]  Things are getting bad.
[01:26:48.267 --> 01:26:49.508]  It means it's almost over.
[01:26:49.808 --> 01:26:51.088]  That is mind control.
[01:26:51.709 --> 01:26:52.949]  I mean, I know what you're saying.
[01:26:53.550 --> 01:26:56.952]  All I was trying to say is that, you know... No, it's a good question.
[01:26:56.972 --> 01:26:57.972]  I'm glad you raised it.
[01:26:58.012 --> 01:27:02.735]  That Armageddon is definitely near, just as you said and many others have said.
[01:27:02.815 --> 01:27:05.136]  And, you know, I was just saying, you know...
[01:27:06.606 --> 01:27:09.549]  No humans can defeat Satan and his demons.
[01:27:09.729 --> 01:27:11.390]  And I love what you do.
[01:27:11.410 --> 01:27:12.931]  I think it's wonderful.
[01:27:12.951 --> 01:27:18.776]  I was just seeing what you thought because, you know, I just believe that... Yeah, listen, I understand.
[01:27:18.796 --> 01:27:19.476]  I appreciate your call.
[01:27:19.496 --> 01:27:20.597]  Let's take another call.
[01:27:20.617 --> 01:27:35.229]  Look, folks, regardless of whether the globalists are going to start releasing bioweapons next week, we have a job to do to expose them because whenever crises are coming, they're going to pose as our saviors as people run into their...
[01:27:35.894 --> 01:27:36.615]  They're arms.
[01:27:37.416 --> 01:27:43.261]  Okay, so a lot of this Armageddon stuff is a cop-out, and it is a cop-out.
[01:27:43.381 --> 01:27:44.483]  We have a job to do.
[01:27:44.543 --> 01:27:45.584]  We have to expose evil.
[01:27:45.924 --> 01:27:47.425]  John in New York, you're on the air.
[01:27:47.465 --> 01:27:47.846]  Go ahead.
[01:27:48.496 --> 01:27:49.937]  Thank you for having me, Alex.
[01:27:49.977 --> 01:27:51.098]  I'll try to be quick here.
[01:27:51.478 --> 01:27:54.520]  Lindsay Williams wrote a book on the non-energy crisis.
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:28:01.204]  He actually predicts that Carter was already pre-tensed to his vote on the Alaskan pipeline.
[01:28:01.224 --> 01:28:04.006]  It was already figured out way before his election.
[01:28:05.067 --> 01:28:09.329]  It showed where the Alaskan pipeline was supposed to be like $1 billion to $10 billion approximately.
[01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:14.873]  It was actually coerced by the controllers to be actually purchased by the World Bank, basically.
[01:28:15.453 --> 01:28:20.417]  And then also, you have the book No Evil is written by a 21-year veteran of the CIA.
[01:28:20.817 --> 01:28:23.919]  Tells where our government is actually the CIA for Exxon and Mobil.
[01:28:24.139 --> 01:28:24.459]  Hey, what?
[01:28:24.499 --> 01:28:24.900]  Stay there.
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:25.400]  All right.
[01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:28.502]  We'll let you finish up and get Dr. Baggage's comment on the other side.
[01:28:30.083 --> 01:28:31.404]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:33.185 --> 01:28:35.427]  The website's prisonplanet.tv.
[01:28:35.467 --> 01:28:36.287]  Be sure and check it out.
[01:28:36.307 --> 01:28:38.449]  My new film, Martial Law, is out on DVD.
[01:28:43.644 --> 01:28:44.625]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.045 --> 01:28:46.726]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.587 --> 01:28:50.349]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.692 --> 01:28:55.832]  All water isn't the same.
[01:28:56.113 --> 01:29:01.116]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[01:29:01.356 --> 01:29:03.958]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[01:29:04.178 --> 01:29:12.704]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.
[01:29:13.084 --> 01:29:21.506]  Aquanorthwest.com carries a full line of products that will increase the water's energy by creating a positive spin and revitalizing water in a high vibration state.
[01:29:21.646 --> 01:29:25.087]  For example, Aquanorthwest.com offers an energy gel mug.

[01:29:33.088 --> 01:29:35.069]  You've all heard about products that energize your water.
[01:29:35.129 --> 01:29:36.489]  Don't be fooled by imitators.
[01:29:36.589 --> 01:29:41.410]  Visit Aquanorthwest.com and learn more about the benefits of positively charged energy water.
[01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:42.331]  Call 888-7AQUA-NW.
[01:29:42.471 --> 01:29:42.832]  That's 888-727-8269.

[01:29:53.297 --> 01:29:58.262]  Now you can bring Berkey purification power anywhere with the Sport Berkey filtration bottle.
[01:29:58.562 --> 01:30:04.007]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[01:30:04.047 --> 01:30:08.351]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[01:30:08.691 --> 01:30:11.714]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[01:30:12.014 --> 01:30:15.437]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[01:30:15.777 --> 01:30:25.128]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[01:30:25.388 --> 01:30:28.892]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[01:30:54.719 --> 01:31:00.201]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:31:00.621 --> 01:31:04.862]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:31:05.082 --> 01:31:12.124]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:12.504 --> 01:31:18.606]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:18.746 --> 01:31:19.966]  There are no side effects.
[01:31:20.146 --> 01:31:20.627]  We're good to go.
[01:31:37.083 --> 01:31:40.228]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.

[01:31:41.551 --> 01:31:41.751]  Call today.
[01:32:03.106 --> 01:32:05.368]  Alright, we're going to go back to your calls here in just a second.
[01:32:05.428 --> 01:32:08.030]  John, Alex, Fred, Roger, Tim, and others.
[01:32:08.110 --> 01:32:13.454]  And of course, Dr. Bagich in a minute will tell you how to get some of his great books and videos as well.
[01:32:14.755 --> 01:32:15.975]  So get your pen and papers ready.
[01:32:16.636 --> 01:32:20.018]  I just want to, before we go back to Dr. Bagich, I just want to say something here.
[01:32:20.259 --> 01:32:25.122]  Not the last caller, but the caller before that caller, Mike.
[01:32:26.583 --> 01:32:31.327]  Mike, I understand what you're saying, but I hear this fatalistic tone coming
[01:32:32.077 --> 01:32:34.298]  In your voice and fatalistic, you know, what you're saying.
[01:32:34.319 --> 01:32:42.704]  I mean, you heard what I had to say and then you just restated that, you know, this is just how it is and it's so evil and we just got to leave it to God.
[01:32:44.965 --> 01:32:51.409]  Well, you know, God has told us that we have a job and that we better get out there and wake people up and stand up against evil.
[01:32:53.070 --> 01:32:54.992]  So, that's important.
[01:32:55.132 --> 01:32:58.654]  And look, don't think for a minute the globalist
[01:32:59.665 --> 01:33:12.796]  Won't Nuka City or at least Smallpox, if they think the population's getting out of control, waking up to their paradigm, shifting too far away from their media control, don't think they won't do that to scare us back into submission to get in line behind them.
[01:33:13.517 --> 01:33:18.061]  But even if we go along with their plans, they're going to carry out those events to get more control over us.
[01:33:18.181 --> 01:33:20.503]  So it's a catch-22 with a trap door.
[01:33:21.204 --> 01:33:24.506]  We have to expose who the real terrorists are, who has the motive.
[01:33:24.927 --> 01:33:26.088]  Kibono is the Roman...
[01:33:27.169 --> 01:33:29.050]  Judges would say, well, who stands to gain?
[01:33:29.110 --> 01:33:30.071]  Who has motive here?
[01:33:31.652 --> 01:33:36.555]  It's the same story over and over again, to where the general public has this awakening, which is happening.
[01:33:37.255 --> 01:33:38.816]  You know, the worm is turning.
[01:33:38.836 --> 01:33:40.577]  We're at the crossroads here.
[01:33:41.457 --> 01:33:43.098]  A zenith of a new renaissance.
[01:33:43.138 --> 01:33:48.962]  I mean, I think we can win this, at least at the point of exposing who the terrorists are.
[01:33:49.622 --> 01:33:54.925]  Tracking back every big terror event, showing who has motive, and then, voila, doesn't surprise us.
[01:33:55.586 --> 01:34:01.715]  The actual physical evidence and eyewitness evidence of who's doing these attacks.
[01:34:03.337 --> 01:34:04.399]  So it's simple, really.
[01:34:06.897 --> 01:34:08.558]  The general public are like children.
[01:34:08.838 --> 01:34:11.078]  The globalists call them cattle, but they've been dumbed down.
[01:34:11.138 --> 01:34:17.000]  They've been made experts on football or how to act cool or how to have the neatest car.
[01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:22.162]  They're not even stupid so much as they're focused and educated on things that don't matter.
[01:34:22.482 --> 01:34:34.726]  We've got to educate them on real things and get people's minds unlocked, not to program them ourselves, but so that they can see the world with the blinders off and wake up on their own.
[01:34:38.164 --> 01:34:45.790]  So they don't run into the arms of the New World Order over and over and over and over and over again.
[01:34:45.850 --> 01:34:49.033]  It's so sad to see this happening.
[01:34:49.854 --> 01:34:50.574]  It's painful.
[01:34:53.136 --> 01:34:56.899]  The general public doesn't understand how politics even really works.
[01:34:56.940 --> 01:35:00.623]  They've been given false information like a computer that's been misprogrammed.
[01:35:01.323 --> 01:35:05.787]  We've got to just remove the cultural, psychological viruses
[01:35:07.153 --> 01:35:13.795]  Kind of as an anti-virus program so that they can function normally and then they'll see it without us even telling them what they see.
[01:35:14.355 --> 01:35:19.236]  See, the globalists have to keep reapplying their lies, their illusion, to keep it going.
[01:35:19.316 --> 01:35:26.738]  We just have to clear the mist for a moment and most people will first freak out and then wake up to seeing the matrix.
[01:35:29.038 --> 01:35:30.359]  And we've got a job to do.
[01:35:32.119 --> 01:35:34.980]  So many people are being deceived and
[01:35:36.366 --> 01:35:42.967]  Even if there was no hope of defeating the New World Order, there is a hope of waking individuals up.
[01:35:43.067 --> 01:35:55.350]  So it's pointless, this mantra I hear in mainstream Christendom, and in mainstream period, this nihilistic, fatalistic, there's nothing we can do, let's just party, eat, drink, and be merry, tomorrow we die.
[01:35:56.930 --> 01:36:02.311]  That attitude, that's really another subset of, I only care about myself,
[01:36:03.095 --> 01:36:04.216]  There's nothing I can do.
[01:36:04.236 --> 01:36:06.037]  I get ahead by only caring about myself.
[01:36:06.297 --> 01:36:07.498]  Folks, that's a fraud.
[01:36:08.598 --> 01:36:16.203]  When you only care about yourself, you ensure an atmosphere in which tyranny explodes and grows.
[01:36:16.963 --> 01:36:19.985]  You've ensured that you personally are in great danger.
[01:36:20.778 --> 01:36:24.159]  Dr. Nick Bagich, any comments on what I'm saying?
[01:36:24.499 --> 01:36:26.060]  Absolutely agree with you, Alex.
[01:36:26.140 --> 01:36:36.603]  The whole thing is government and institutions that take away our power rather than build our higher potentials are exactly what's working against us.
[01:36:37.043 --> 01:36:38.343]  It's a coming to fear.
[01:36:38.463 --> 01:36:41.264]  When I think about Mike's call a little while ago, that's
[01:36:42.308 --> 01:36:45.972]  It's a very common kind of question that I get from time to time.
[01:36:45.992 --> 01:36:48.514]  Well, it's pretty clear they killed your dad, but here you are.
[01:36:48.654 --> 01:36:52.678]  Yeah, and I know when you stop at fear, I'll tell you, that's when you lose the battle.
[01:36:52.918 --> 01:36:56.842]  And so much of what's being generated is to create fear in the population.
[01:36:57.429 --> 01:37:09.895]  And when you look at what happens, I mean, just look at the physical changes that happen within a human brain when you're engaged in fear, you get what are called incoherent brain patterns, the kinds of patterns that don't lend themselves to good thinking.
[01:37:09.955 --> 01:37:11.696]  Well, your higher systems shut down.
[01:37:11.916 --> 01:37:12.856]  That's exactly it.
[01:37:12.997 --> 01:37:15.938]  And so the things that are important in a complexed,
[01:37:16.138 --> 01:37:16.838]  I think we're good to go.
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:37.062]  You know, we're getting plenty of warnings these days.
[01:37:37.102 --> 01:37:44.889]  The question is, are we going to wake up and are we going to act in the ways that are responsible that can generate the counterflow?
[01:37:44.909 --> 01:37:46.190]  And I think people are waking up.
[01:37:46.290 --> 01:37:47.731]  I certainly see it around the country.
[01:37:47.991 --> 01:37:56.018]  Well, that's the first question I was going to ask you when you got on with us an hour ago, is that ten years ago, I mean, most people disagreed with me.
[01:37:56.118 --> 01:38:02.744]  Now I can't get people to disagree with me, not on my own show, on other people's broadcasts, people on the street, cops.
[01:38:03.385 --> 01:38:11.808]  Firemen, government workers, FBI agents, I mean, people are... I'm really seeing a massive shift, and I think the controllers are panicking.
[01:38:11.848 --> 01:38:12.148]  Doctor?
[01:38:12.549 --> 01:38:13.449]  I agree with you.
[01:38:13.929 --> 01:38:24.873]  And when you see how they react to this kind of thing, it's to increase the fear levels, because that, again, shuts down the critical thinking mechanisms within the larger segments of the population.
[01:38:24.913 --> 01:38:31.116]  But if people remember, you know, it's been said that the American Revolution started with 6% of the people thinking it was a good idea.
[01:38:31.656 --> 01:38:32.617]  Thank God for 6%.
[01:38:33.517 --> 01:38:38.841]  You know, today, people look around and say, oh, you know, no one's doing anything and they're apathetic.
[01:38:38.861 --> 01:38:40.602]  You know, apathy works in your favor.
[01:38:40.622 --> 01:38:45.206]  You know, if only 15% of the people pull a lever at the pole, you only got to convince 8% of them you're right.
[01:38:45.306 --> 01:38:49.489]  And I'm sick of that mantra of we can't do anything, we can't get it done.
[01:38:49.509 --> 01:39:00.036]  You know, that's that type of procrastination when you look at your garage and five years of junk is in there and you don't think you can do it, but at the end of the Saturday, you know, day or Sunday or whatever, the thing's clean.
[01:39:00.316 --> 01:39:00.536]  Yep.
[01:39:00.696 --> 01:39:07.640]  And the reality is, again, that removes power from people when you start to question your ability as an individual.
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:12.403]  Everything that was ever important to humankind from the beginning of humankind... Was hard.
[01:39:12.803 --> 01:39:17.325]  It was hard, and it started with one or two people saying, hey, I see things just a little bit differently.
[01:39:17.786 --> 01:39:21.207]  And I don't care whether it's in business, politics, religion, or science.
[01:39:21.668 --> 01:39:24.009]  That's where it starts, by someone individually...
[01:39:24.582 --> 01:39:29.747]  Making that decision and then making that step of faith by acting on what they know to change something.
[01:39:29.787 --> 01:39:31.208]  And we can do it in our neighborhoods.
[01:39:31.248 --> 01:39:32.489]  We can do it in our communities.
[01:39:32.829 --> 01:39:33.890]  And we can do it on a much larger scale.
[01:39:33.910 --> 01:39:34.991]  It really is an attitude.
[01:39:35.371 --> 01:39:35.692]  It is.
[01:39:35.832 --> 01:39:38.934]  And the other thing is you're not alone.
[01:39:38.974 --> 01:39:40.556]  Don't wait for some group to be formed.
[01:39:40.596 --> 01:39:41.276]  It already is.
[01:39:41.316 --> 01:39:42.077]  You're standing in it.
[01:39:42.117 --> 01:39:43.819]  It's right in the middle of your shoes.
[01:39:43.839 --> 01:39:48.122]  And you're part of that group, part of those people that have woken up and are doing something.
[01:39:48.623 --> 01:39:50.444]  Don't look for any formal organizations.
[01:39:50.464 --> 01:39:51.225]  You don't need them.
[01:39:51.676 --> 01:39:52.697]  You're it.
[01:39:52.797 --> 01:39:55.119]  Formal organizations get corrupted over time.
[01:39:55.199 --> 01:40:03.325]  Individuals have some integrity, can move forward, learn from their mistakes, pick themselves up from each mistake, and do something better each time.
[01:40:03.385 --> 01:40:10.210]  And I don't mean this to sound like mumbo-jumbo, but since people bring up Christ, love your neighbor as yourself.
[01:40:10.330 --> 01:40:11.671]  I mean, it really does start...
[01:40:12.279 --> 01:40:26.908]  With loving your family, not letting your children watch TV, spending time with your family, not flipping the person back off when they flip you off on the highway, this hatred, this animalistic idea they're trying to sell us, they want us to be like they are.
[01:40:27.688 --> 01:40:28.629]  That's exactly it.
[01:40:28.669 --> 01:40:30.630]  And that's not what human beings were meant to be.
[01:40:30.990 --> 01:40:34.072]  And when you look at what's going on technologically now...
[01:40:34.744 --> 01:40:39.668]  You know, we really kind of get locked into this idea that we need the latest, best gadget.
[01:40:39.689 --> 01:40:42.331]  You know, when you really ask yourself, why do I need this stuff?
[01:40:42.971 --> 01:40:44.513]  A lot of it you really don't need.
[01:40:44.533 --> 01:40:45.334]  Well, here's an example.
[01:40:45.494 --> 01:40:48.296]  I have the old cell phone that isn't satellite triangulated.
[01:40:48.877 --> 01:40:49.397]  Yeah.
[01:40:49.617 --> 01:40:53.401]  And it broke, and they didn't want to sell me another one, so I said, okay, I'll take the new phone.
[01:40:54.116 --> 01:40:55.256]  It doesn't even work.
[01:40:56.077 --> 01:40:57.617]  Half of the places my other one worked.
[01:40:57.978 --> 01:40:58.938]  It's more expensive.
[01:40:59.278 --> 01:41:03.760]  I'm taking it back and going to one of the last places that will let me have the old-fashioned phone.
[01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:07.681]  But the point is that we don't need all this junk.
[01:41:08.041 --> 01:41:08.241]  Right.
[01:41:08.281 --> 01:41:11.142]  I mean, as busy as I am, I don't even have a cell phone.
[01:41:11.242 --> 01:41:12.303]  I don't have a pager either.
[01:41:12.323 --> 01:41:15.404]  I mean, when I'm out of my office, you can't find me unless you know where I went.
[01:41:16.624 --> 01:41:18.785]  And, you know, there's something to be said for that.
[01:41:18.845 --> 01:41:21.466]  I mean, personal privacy is a big deal for me.
[01:41:21.626 --> 01:41:23.267]  And I look at just the whole...
[01:41:24.094 --> 01:41:32.880]  Transparency of populations, while our governments become more opaque and difficult to look into, just the opposite of what should be happening is happening.
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:37.483]  And when you look around the country and you start to ask yourself, you know, what is going on?
[01:41:37.823 --> 01:41:43.947]  You know this big controversy with, I believe it was Centerpoint that lost all this data on individuals?
[01:41:44.540 --> 01:41:50.065]  You know, Centerpoint, we wrote about in 1999 in the book Earth Rising, the Revolution.
[01:41:50.085 --> 01:41:55.050]  Yeah, they do this stuff on purpose every time to pass more legislation.
[01:41:55.430 --> 01:42:05.300]  But that particular company also has a contract with the Department of Justice that was non-competitive going back to the 1990s that gave them access to 3.5 billion records at that time.
[01:42:08.062 --> 01:42:13.284]  ...on American citizens for them to peruse and use for profiling American populations.
[01:42:13.304 --> 01:42:14.545]  Yeah, more data mining.
[01:42:14.805 --> 01:42:18.546]  Yeah, and you know, they actually, in Europe, they coined the phrase data valence.
[01:42:18.606 --> 01:42:28.210]  And we quote quite a bit from the European Parliament and European media within Earth Rising because they really understand what invasiveness of privacy is about.
[01:42:28.250 --> 01:42:32.792]  Because most people, at least in Eastern Europe, certainly understand it from their own personal experience.
[01:42:33.266 --> 01:42:37.028]  And elders in Western Europe understand it quite well from their own experience.
[01:42:37.068 --> 01:42:42.950]  Well, that's where the globalists have a leg up, is Americans have had it so good, we don't know what we've got until it's gone.
[01:42:42.970 --> 01:42:45.751]  Real fast, plug some of your materials, and we've got to go right back to the calls.
[01:42:46.012 --> 01:42:46.272]  Sure.
[01:42:46.332 --> 01:42:48.012]  We've got several books out.
[01:42:48.072 --> 01:42:52.374]  Angels Don't Play This Harp, our classic, and then Earth Rising, The Revolution, Earth Rising 2.
[01:42:52.995 --> 01:42:58.337]  And these you can get, hopefully we'll get them in your bookstore, Alex, but you can get them toll-free at 888-690-7000.
[01:43:02.292 --> 01:43:02.672]  888-690-1277.
[01:43:02.732 --> 01:43:03.012]  Again, 888-690-1277.
[01:43:06.154 --> 01:43:10.137]  Or take a look at our website at earthpulse.com.
[01:43:10.478 --> 01:43:12.179]  earthpulse.com.
[01:43:12.239 --> 01:43:16.202]  Give that number out again.
[01:43:16.222 --> 01:43:16.502]  888-690-1277.
[01:43:16.602 --> 01:43:18.083]  We'll give that out again in the next hour.
[01:43:18.103 --> 01:43:19.704]  Okay, I've got to go quick now.
[01:43:19.784 --> 01:43:22.126]  Caller John New York, finish up what you were saying.
[01:43:22.726 --> 01:43:23.687]  All right.
[01:43:23.987 --> 01:43:25.989]  You were talking about $200 billion with Iraq.
[01:43:26.570 --> 01:43:33.656]  Initially, in the Philippines, they had a $3 billion investment by the big boys, and it cost our taxpayers through the military $7 billion to keep them free.
[01:43:34.156 --> 01:43:39.821]  Also, they were talking on the Today Show this morning about bohemian styles, so it's just another twist of them trying to get bohemian in.
[01:43:40.241 --> 01:43:44.805]  And they're talking about the memorial about Tim McVeigh hitting the Oklahoma...
[01:43:46.058 --> 01:43:52.241]  Federal Building, and that's being promoted as just Tim McVeigh, and you should be doing something about promoting the truth about that again.
[01:43:52.461 --> 01:43:59.045]  Meanwhile, Terry Nichols is coming out in his trial and exposing the fact of government informants involved in the bombing.
[01:44:00.025 --> 01:44:02.867]  And just, hey, appreciate your show, Jay.
[01:44:03.027 --> 01:44:03.767]  Thanks for the time.
[01:44:04.047 --> 01:44:04.507]  Thank you.
[01:44:05.188 --> 01:44:10.791]  Let's go ahead quickly now, and let's talk to Alex in North Carolina, Fred, Roger, and others.
[01:44:10.811 --> 01:44:11.571]  Go ahead, Alex.
[01:44:11.991 --> 01:44:12.351]  Hi, Alex.
[01:44:12.391 --> 01:44:13.152]  Hi, Dr. Baggage.
[01:44:14.279 --> 01:44:28.111]  Alex, I saw Marshall Law, and I want to tell you that seeing, since we spoke of bohemians, watching that bohemian get cornered by you and to see the smile go off his face and the color to drain out of his face was worth the price of admission alone.
[01:44:28.211 --> 01:44:29.933]  I can't wait to get it on DVD.
[01:44:30.273 --> 01:44:30.854]  It's just great.
[01:44:30.974 --> 01:44:31.454]  Well, thank you.
[01:44:31.554 --> 01:44:33.216]  It's out, so thank you.
[01:44:33.376 --> 01:44:41.763]  What I wanted to say, though, was that I think what gets well-meaning people on the peak oil issue, and maybe people who are like halfway awake or still think maybe that
[01:44:42.392 --> 01:44:44.614]  Being on the left of the issue is the solution.
[01:44:44.654 --> 01:44:53.180]  I think what gets them is the idea that it would be just as profitable for the globalists to have a real shortage as a fake one.
[01:44:53.500 --> 01:44:55.541]  And the real shortage is maybe scarier.
[01:44:55.982 --> 01:44:58.263]  Well, it's part of that fatalism.
[01:44:58.283 --> 01:45:08.671]  They always want to think Planet X is going to get us, Y2K is going to get us, the peak oil is going to get us, because if everything is going to be destroyed next year, I don't have to do anything.
[01:45:10.052 --> 01:45:14.114]  Well, and what does that do to your buying patterns in the rest of your life?
[01:45:14.194 --> 01:45:16.856]  I mean, we saw it before Y2K in the most extreme.
[01:45:16.876 --> 01:45:23.999]  You know, a lot of people spent a lot of money getting ready for something that didn't happen, running up credit cards thinking there's not going to be a tomorrow.
[01:45:24.059 --> 01:45:27.681]  And we can trace that back to the Naval Report and the Y2K czar.
[01:45:27.721 --> 01:45:31.903]  They said it was all going to happen, but a few months before, then they said, we never said anything was going to happen.
[01:45:32.243 --> 01:45:33.604]  Yeah, and that's exactly it.
[01:45:33.664 --> 01:45:36.065]  And, you know, these kinds of, again, fear and panic,
[01:45:36.633 --> 01:45:38.415]  Allow the country to drift a certain direction.
[01:45:38.435 --> 01:45:44.320]  There was a paper that we've spoken about before called The Revolution of Military Affairs and Conflicts Short of War, put out by the U.S.
[01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:45.180]  Army War College.
[01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:46.001]  Alexander, yeah.
[01:45:46.501 --> 01:45:54.328]  And, you know, this particular paper was talking about international terrorism and international drug trafficking as the major issues for the 1990s.
[01:45:55.769 --> 01:46:02.516]  As a way to create fear and anxiety in order to bring in new technologies that the public would otherwise oppose.
[01:46:02.536 --> 01:46:03.637]  That's the incredible part.
[01:46:03.717 --> 01:46:08.401]  In their white papers, they say what they're going to do, and then exactly what they say happens.
[01:46:08.662 --> 01:46:16.029]  Yep, and in this case, the things they were talking about were knocking out aircraft, for instance, using EMP, electromagnetic pulse,
[01:46:16.622 --> 01:46:23.969]  In other words, being able to see maybe where a drug trafficker is transiting a country, pass the intelligence on, and then they could knock out the aircraft.
[01:46:24.309 --> 01:46:33.117]  And there was a lot of discussion in this paper in 1989 about the constitutionality of, you know, because it kind of ignores the idea of juries and judges and those basic sort of things that we think... Have you heard the latest?
[01:46:33.177 --> 01:46:42.265]  Bush is now coming out and saying one of the threats to freedom is law, and that we need to ignore law because it aids the terrorists.
[01:46:42.285 --> 01:46:42.926]  No, I'm not kidding.
[01:46:43.226 --> 01:46:44.827]  Yeah, I can absolutely believe it.
[01:46:44.847 --> 01:46:48.048]  That's what you get when you elect to see a student out of an Ivy League school.
[01:46:48.848 --> 01:46:54.831]  I mean, this guy is not thinking in terms of what is important to Americans.
[01:46:55.711 --> 01:47:03.294]  Ignoring the law as a way to circumvent the rules for a more controlled and directed society is exactly what it's about.
[01:47:03.314 --> 01:47:05.355]  Well, Gonzalez says Bush is the law.
[01:47:06.016 --> 01:47:09.297]  Folks, that's called dictatorship with a capital D. Anything else, Alex?
[01:47:10.570 --> 01:47:12.511]  Have you ever had Lawrence Lessig on?
[01:47:12.531 --> 01:47:15.774]  Because his book, what is it called?
[01:47:16.075 --> 01:47:19.838]  Is it something about code and the law, or code and the basis of law?
[01:47:19.958 --> 01:47:21.119]  It's probably not the right title.
[01:47:21.439 --> 01:47:25.603]  He basically talks about the fact that the corporations will simply circumvent any law they don't like.
[01:47:25.643 --> 01:47:26.524]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:47:26.904 --> 01:47:29.627]  Look, at the point we've reached, they don't even follow any law.
[01:47:29.987 --> 01:47:30.948]  It's all just a facade.
[01:47:30.988 --> 01:47:31.649]  Thanks for the call.
[01:47:32.864 --> 01:47:37.427]  You know, Alex, on that line, think about the biggest bank robbery in the history of the country.
[01:47:37.447 --> 01:47:41.629]  It was the trillion-dollar SNL scandal, and how many people went to jail for that?
[01:47:41.849 --> 01:47:42.449]  One or two.
[01:47:42.589 --> 01:47:44.730]  Yeah, exactly the same kind of situation.
[01:47:45.270 --> 01:47:50.093]  You knock off the corner 7-Eleven for 50 bucks, you're in for 10 years or longer.
[01:47:50.453 --> 01:47:52.794]  These guys hijacked the entire U.S.
[01:47:52.834 --> 01:47:56.396]  economy for a couple of years and forever in terms of paying the debt off.
[01:47:56.816 --> 01:48:05.040]  And then one Patsy gets two years in a federal Hilton, and then five years later he's at presidential dinners again.
[01:48:05.340 --> 01:48:06.681]  Yeah, exactly right.
[01:48:06.741 --> 01:48:11.123]  Handing out bucks for whatever cause or social cause mitigates his guilt.
[01:48:12.063 --> 01:48:25.469]  The nonsense that has happened in this country at the hands of multinationals that continues to this day, whether you're talking the pharmaceutical industry, the telecommunications industry, or any of the major players, oil and gas, mineral interests,
[01:48:26.067 --> 01:48:30.171]  It is the government of special interest for special interest at our expense.
[01:48:30.211 --> 01:48:31.952]  And again, that's not free market.
[01:48:32.332 --> 01:48:33.633]  They are becoming the government.
[01:48:33.674 --> 01:48:34.734]  That's all that's happening.
[01:48:35.235 --> 01:48:37.257]  Let's talk to Fred in Pennsylvania.
[01:48:37.277 --> 01:48:37.957]  Fred, go ahead.
[01:48:37.977 --> 01:48:38.998]  Hi, Alex.
[01:48:39.518 --> 01:48:40.439]  Hi.
[01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:43.902]  I want to ask Dr. Beggis something.
[01:48:43.942 --> 01:48:53.610]  First of all, I don't know that much about you, but you seem to have a number of degrees in science and not just medicine.
[01:48:53.650 --> 01:48:54.171]  Is that true?
[01:48:54.674 --> 01:49:02.866]  Well, I have a doctorate in traditional and complementary medicines, but I report on the sciences and I work with lots of specialists in a number of fields.
[01:49:02.946 --> 01:49:04.669]  When we write, we actually send...
[01:49:05.467 --> 01:49:11.610]  material technical material for review by specialists and as a consequence Yeah, the publications are full of scientists.
[01:49:11.870 --> 01:49:23.396]  Yeah, and you'll see like in the two two main books You'll see over earth rising earth rising to our newest ones on the topics that we're covering today those Those have over a thousand footnoted sources.
[01:49:23.516 --> 01:49:24.857]  These aren't conversations.
[01:49:24.957 --> 01:49:27.699]  I want to look at Alex I want to also
[01:49:28.599 --> 01:49:40.404]  Talk about a couple patents that I've run into on free energy, and also Dr. Begich's book, The Coming Energy Revolution, with Gene Manning, which is an excellent book.
[01:49:41.004 --> 01:49:43.505]  All right, we'll let you comment on that when we get back on the other side.
[01:49:43.525 --> 01:49:45.886]  We've got Dr. Begich with us into the next hour as well.
[01:49:45.906 --> 01:49:50.808]  A bunch of other key issues coming up, and a smattering of the news of the day.

[01:52:59.024 --> 01:53:03.527]  In a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[01:53:04.647 --> 01:53:05.868]  That's what it says on the front.
[01:53:06.789 --> 01:53:13.273]  And on the back it says, learnthetruthinfullwars.com Real simple, made in America.
[01:53:13.613 --> 01:53:15.874]  The t-shirts themselves are made in America.
[01:53:15.934 --> 01:53:21.318]  They're printed up right here at an Austin company that pays their employees well.
[01:53:22.006 --> 01:53:25.568]  So the t-shirts, if it's an extra, extra large, cost me like $8 apiece.
[01:53:26.868 --> 01:53:28.869]  And the rest of them cost me about $5, $56.
[01:53:29.630 --> 01:53:30.330]  But that's okay.
[01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:32.531]  I could have got them from Mexico for $2 apiece.
[01:53:32.591 --> 01:53:34.132]  But we're just not doing that.
[01:53:34.472 --> 01:53:35.832]  They're $19.95.
[01:53:37.573 --> 01:53:41.295]  And I hope that you will get the new t-shirt.
[01:53:42.055 --> 01:53:45.057]  We have the big Berkeys that we sell via the website as well.
[01:53:45.697 --> 01:53:46.677]  Those are made in America.
[01:53:46.737 --> 01:53:48.618]  The black Berkey system made in America.
[01:53:48.638 --> 01:53:50.039]  And we have those.
[01:53:51.286 --> 01:53:56.710]  My new film is out, Martial Law 9-11, Rise of the Police State on DVD.

[01:53:57.791 --> 01:54:00.353]  It's really three films in one.
[01:54:00.773 --> 01:54:03.095]  The most powerful 9-11 film out there, bar none.
[01:54:03.135 --> 01:54:04.196]  I can officially say that.
[01:54:04.216 --> 01:54:09.099]  It also covers the police state and the Nazi connections and the order of death who controls things.
[01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:12.742]  And you need to get this new film, folks.
[01:54:12.842 --> 01:54:14.023]  It's my best work.

[01:54:14.803 --> 01:54:15.664]  Please make copies.
[01:54:15.764 --> 01:54:16.845]  Please get it out to folks.
[01:54:17.225 --> 01:54:19.627]  It won't be seen unless you get it and make copies and get it out to people.
[01:54:20.051 --> 01:54:21.933]  We've also got some discounts if you get more than one.
[01:54:21.953 --> 01:54:27.377]  1-888-253-3139 is the toll-free number to order.
[01:54:27.397 --> 01:54:29.319]  888-253-3139.
[01:54:30.420 --> 01:54:41.229]  Or order it via the SafeSecure online shopping cart, the t-shirts, or the videos, any of it, at InfoWars.com, or watch them all online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:54:41.629 --> 01:54:43.390]  Please take action.
[01:54:44.131 --> 01:54:46.553]  We can affect change, and these videos are powerful.
[01:54:47.290 --> 01:54:48.371]  You've heard the rave reviews.
[01:54:48.451 --> 01:54:49.791]  You want to call in and say it's a bad video?
[01:54:49.811 --> 01:54:50.372]  You're welcome to.
[01:54:50.392 --> 01:54:51.192]  We don't screen the calls.
[01:54:51.212 --> 01:54:52.213]  We can defend ourselves here.
[01:54:52.453 --> 01:54:54.054]  But nobody's called to say it's a bad video.
[01:54:54.374 --> 01:54:56.155]  People are saying it's the best they've ever seen.
[01:54:57.356 --> 01:55:02.158]  Let's go back to... I guess we were talking to Fred in Pennsylvania.
[01:55:02.218 --> 01:55:04.039]  Fred, finish up what you were saying for Dr. Begich.
[01:55:04.339 --> 01:55:06.881]  Okay.
[01:55:07.901 --> 01:55:14.925]  The thing I wanted to say was that there's an earlier book by Dr. Begich and Gene Manning called The Coming Energy Revolution, which...
[01:55:16.801 --> 01:55:26.228]  It is great and it also has a section in there on the patent system and the patent impounding that can happen.
[01:55:26.758 --> 01:55:29.900]  Well, let me get a comment from him on that.
[01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:31.060]  Let me get a comment from him on that.
[01:55:31.100 --> 01:55:31.581]  Dr. Baggett?
[01:55:31.601 --> 01:55:31.961]  Sure.
[01:55:32.021 --> 01:55:34.422]  The book was actually authored by Jean Manning.
[01:55:34.462 --> 01:55:37.004]  She was my co-author on Angels Don't Play This Harp.
[01:55:37.724 --> 01:55:41.826]  And I can tell you, Jean did an excellent job of putting that together.
[01:55:41.846 --> 01:55:43.787]  It's got a great bibliography in the back.
[01:55:43.988 --> 01:55:46.929]  Unfortunately, it's out of print, so you have to find it at libraries.
[01:55:47.750 --> 01:55:53.873]  But the whole concept of alternative energy patents being confiscated, it actually goes way beyond energy patents.
[01:55:54.369 --> 01:56:00.414]  The United States government, before any patent is issued, actually goes through a review process by every security agency.
[01:56:00.674 --> 01:56:03.677]  And they say, is this allowable for national security?
[01:56:04.017 --> 01:56:04.497]  Absolutely.
[01:56:04.517 --> 01:56:08.080]  And that means, i.e., does it keep the big banks and the oil companies in place?
[01:56:08.421 --> 01:56:09.061]  Absolutely.
[01:56:09.081 --> 01:56:19.910]  And what happens is these patents routinely are confiscated under national security laws that forbid an individual from working on the technology, talking about the technology.
[01:56:19.930 --> 01:56:22.232]  They have to disclose everyone they've ever discussed it with.
[01:56:23.011 --> 01:56:23.671]  To those agencies.
[01:56:23.751 --> 01:56:28.773]  And the only way they can ever work on them again is within government labs that are sanctioned by those security agencies.
[01:56:28.793 --> 01:56:36.455]  And then they take that selectively and use that for secret military projects, or they take a small part of a development and allow some big corporation to deploy it later.
[01:56:36.815 --> 01:56:37.376]  Absolutely.
[01:56:37.416 --> 01:56:39.096]  And the little guy has no way to fight it.
[01:56:39.236 --> 01:56:44.498]  And then when they confiscate it, you know, the Constitution says you're supposed to be paid for things that are taken from you.
[01:56:44.858 --> 01:56:46.039]  No just compensation?
[01:56:46.259 --> 01:56:52.442]  None, because you have no way to go out and do a market survey to figure out what your stuff is worth, because they won't let you talk about it.
[01:56:52.482 --> 01:56:55.984]  So they basically pay you a pittance.
[01:56:56.164 --> 01:56:57.085]  And here's the option.
[01:56:57.245 --> 01:56:58.906]  Your option is treason.
[01:56:59.066 --> 01:57:01.247]  You go to jail and you never see the light of day again.
[01:57:01.347 --> 01:57:05.410]  Well, it's like they'll track you down for ten years if you go to Serbia to play chess.
[01:57:06.773 --> 01:57:09.254]  I mean, they tell you what you can do and how you can do it.
[01:57:09.294 --> 01:57:09.855]  That's freedom.
[01:57:10.155 --> 01:57:10.815]  That's right.
[01:57:11.035 --> 01:57:20.620]  And, you know, when you really look at it all, you know, justice and freedom in the United States unfortunately has a direct proportional relationship to the size of your wallet.
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:22.541]  Well, it's an illusion in many respects.
[01:57:22.621 --> 01:57:23.221]  Absolutely.
[01:57:24.201 --> 01:57:26.703]  Freedom is not being able to go to any football game you want, folks.
[01:57:27.323 --> 01:57:33.306]  Freedom is being able to raise your children and develop technologies and live your life and not drink poison in your water supply.
[01:57:33.946 --> 01:57:40.973]  And I would add, to boil it down with the patents, we could all have solar cars that drove 150 miles an hour, but we won't ever have it.
[01:57:40.993 --> 01:57:48.801]  Thank you.
[01:57:49.762 --> 01:57:50.422]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.063 --> 01:57:52.164]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.845 --> 01:57:54.026]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.586 --> 01:57:55.447]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.168 --> 01:57:56.969]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.731 --> 01:58:01.694]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.894 --> 01:58:06.038]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.360 --> 01:58:14.224]  This neo-feudal global slave grid is really following a mercantile model.
[01:58:14.924 --> 01:58:15.905]  It's not free market.
[01:58:16.666 --> 01:58:19.328]  Mercantilism was a French model where they were trying to...
[01:58:20.094 --> 01:58:21.215]  Control the Renaissance.
[01:58:21.255 --> 01:58:29.320]  They'd say, okay, you can own and have businesses, but it's got to be licensed through a representative of the Crown and controlled as a sub-corporation of the Crown.
[01:58:30.241 --> 01:58:39.448]  And then they'd say, okay, well, let's say in this holding we've got in the Caribbean, you can't manufacture any finished goods or value-added goods, only raw materials.
[01:58:40.008 --> 01:58:44.411]  And then they would play the different sectors off against each other economically.
[01:58:44.431 --> 01:58:45.872]  It was just neo-feudalism.
[01:58:47.293 --> 01:58:48.574]  And it's the same thing today.
[01:58:49.758 --> 01:59:03.953]  Again, they have patented, you know, this is mainstream, solar systems, solar panels that give you like five times the power of the conventional solar panels.
[01:59:05.434 --> 01:59:07.676]  And that's why the globalists need global government.
[01:59:08.117 --> 01:59:13.262]  So that no, quote, rogue nation is allowed to have that stuff developed in their country.
[01:59:14.224 --> 01:59:19.408]  Even though it was developed here 20 years ago, because then they could become dominant or a rival.
[01:59:19.809 --> 01:59:40.106]  They've got to have global government to kind of freeze technological development at our plane of civilization, while behind the walls of national security, building technological spires where the elites have access to all those advanced technologies for themselves to suppress the general population and to extend their own lives.
[01:59:40.126 --> 01:59:42.548]  Do you agree with that analysis, Dr. Begich?
[01:59:42.568 --> 01:59:42.908]  We do.
[01:59:42.968 --> 02:00:01.991]  In fact, energy as a component, I mean, if you really looked at energy being free or so low in cost that essentially it was as plentiful as, well, I won't say fresh air because maybe that's not so plentiful anymore, but you know what I'm saying, as plentiful as the water in the sea, then you change everything.
[02:00:02.051 --> 02:00:12.033]  Because when you think about energy as a cost, if you could free up what amounts to probably 20-25% of every dollar you spend at the end of the day really goes to energy, then
[02:00:12.412 --> 02:00:21.098]  If you could pull that out and put that elsewhere in terms of paying for your education or paying for your health care or paying for your groceries, for goodness sake, what a difference.
[02:00:21.598 --> 02:00:25.621]  It also shatters the models of how our society is set up.
[02:00:26.181 --> 02:00:27.022]  Absolutely.
[02:00:27.142 --> 02:00:33.526]  Independence and energy, not for countries but for individuals, equals freedom in a technological age.
[02:00:34.019 --> 02:00:43.021]  Independence and technology and access to technology that serves our interests and doesn't work against us is what is going to enhance our freedoms in a technological age.
[02:00:43.041 --> 02:00:55.184]  You know, the very technologies used to degrade human performance, to be used as weapons of war, the whole array of non-lethals that we've talked about in the past and we talk extensively within our books,
[02:00:55.862 --> 02:01:05.726]  This change is going to create a society that cannot just be directed by propaganda, but directed through direct control.
[02:01:05.766 --> 02:01:21.472]  Well, look at what the energy of instant thought and communication, you know, the giant collective unconscious, which is real, folks, being interfaced with the Internet, is actually being turned against the globalists.
[02:01:21.492 --> 02:01:22.112]  They're panicking.
[02:01:22.532 --> 02:01:32.437]  Yeah, and the Internet as a transfer system for influencing human behavior, not just through propaganda, but through the use of energy oscillations that can be put on the Internet.
[02:01:32.457 --> 02:01:43.103]  There was a publication in the former Soviet Union military publication called Orienteer that was translated and then enhanced in an article by Perimeters, which is U.S.
[02:01:43.123 --> 02:01:49.126]  Army War College, called The Mind Has No Firewalls, which lays out quite clearly how these systems can be used
[02:01:49.861 --> 02:02:02.210]  In an April 7th this year story in the New Scientist, there's actually an article about a new Sony patent and some successor patents that actually can create the illusions.
[02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:11.037]  All the sensory input from smell, touch, all of it can be created artificially under this patent.
[02:02:11.417 --> 02:02:18.282]  So what they're looking at is they say even the blind and deaf people have a chance to hear the patent claims and see the patent claims.
[02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:19.461]  And it's a double-edged sword.
[02:02:19.481 --> 02:02:19.921]  Absolutely.
[02:02:19.941 --> 02:02:21.422]  Could really enhance us or degrade us.
[02:02:21.442 --> 02:02:26.325]  Depends on who's driving the truck, whether it's delivering your mail or the next bomb.
[02:02:26.345 --> 02:02:27.206]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:46.073 --> 02:02:53.476]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:02:53.736 --> 02:02:58.458]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:02:58.698 --> 02:03:04.340]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:05.301]  We're good to go.
[02:03:29.779 --> 02:03:30.060]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:03:45.166 --> 02:03:48.049]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:03:48.409 --> 02:03:51.291]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:03:51.512 --> 02:03:57.717]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[02:04:39.935 --> 02:04:48.519]  With gardening season coming up, you'll soon be building your compost pile.
[02:04:48.719 --> 02:04:51.420]  And that's why there's a great gardening tool I have to tell you about.
[02:04:51.620 --> 02:04:53.001]  It's called the Compost Twin.
[02:04:53.181 --> 02:05:03.085]  Gardeners know the importance of composting, but we're all too familiar with the back-breaking work of turning the compost pile with a pitchfork and the messy accumulation of kitchen scraps while you wait for a batch of compost to cook.
[02:05:03.305 --> 02:05:05.026]  So Mantis developed the Compost Twin.
[02:05:05.326 --> 02:05:09.190]  The compost twin is the only composter with two 10-bushel bins on one machine.
[02:05:09.410 --> 02:05:13.854]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.
[02:05:14.054 --> 02:05:17.898]  Plus, mixing the compost is a breeze with the compost twin's easy-turn gear system.
[02:05:18.118 --> 02:05:24.323]  And with a second chamber, you can continually add kitchen scraps and garden waste without disturbing the composting process in the first chamber.
[02:05:24.503 --> 02:05:27.246]  No more mess, no more odors, no more hard work.
[02:05:27.466 --> 02:05:30.788]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:30.808 --> 02:05:32.429]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:54.222 --> 02:05:55.303]  All right, my friends.
[02:05:55.343 --> 02:05:57.666]  Eight minutes, ten seconds into this third hour.
[02:05:57.726 --> 02:06:04.773]  No matter what hour you're listening to this in and what time zone or what broadcast of this transmission against tyranny.
[02:06:06.334 --> 02:06:06.875]  It's simple.
[02:06:07.155 --> 02:06:09.437]  The globalist know technology is a double-edged sword.
[02:06:09.918 --> 02:06:11.759]  They're the social architects, the controllers.
[02:06:12.340 --> 02:06:13.641]  They are the progeny.
[02:06:14.502 --> 02:06:17.265]  Their ancestors were the feudal rulers.
[02:06:17.964 --> 02:06:18.785]  We're good to go.
[02:06:45.996 --> 02:06:47.297]  You see how that propaganda works?
[02:06:47.618 --> 02:06:51.221]  It's very sophisticated, and that's just one little piece of data.
[02:06:51.901 --> 02:06:53.943]  Much of Canada is owned by the royal family.
[02:06:53.983 --> 02:06:55.364]  Much of Australia is owned by them.
[02:06:55.665 --> 02:06:57.166]  A lot of our big banks are owned by them.
[02:06:57.206 --> 02:06:58.667]  Part of our Federal Reserve is owned by them.
[02:06:58.908 --> 02:07:04.693]  This is all publicly available, but the average person, oh, they're a bunch of fools over there dressed up like clowns.
[02:07:05.173 --> 02:07:09.297]  They don't have anything, or the British government's got to pay for their palace when it burns down.
[02:07:10.226 --> 02:07:13.568]  Really, the Queen owns almost all the right-of-ways in England and in most of the land.
[02:07:13.908 --> 02:07:16.449]  Again, people just don't know this.
[02:07:19.030 --> 02:07:20.591]  And that's just one small facet.
[02:07:20.611 --> 02:07:22.392]  So they know technology is here.
[02:07:22.592 --> 02:07:26.534]  And they know it's either going to free us and decentralize things.
[02:07:27.580 --> 02:07:28.301]  We're good to go.
[02:07:51.958 --> 02:07:53.920]  And we're going to force half of them on it.
[02:07:53.940 --> 02:07:58.603]  People that don't believe that, on average, over two-thirds of foster children are already on these.
[02:07:58.623 --> 02:08:01.225]  When they have a captive audience, over two-thirds.
[02:08:01.685 --> 02:08:03.447]  Pushing 70 plus percent now.
[02:08:04.407 --> 02:08:06.629]  So, it's worse than two-thirds.
[02:08:06.669 --> 02:08:08.891]  I mean, this is what they do with a captive audience.
[02:08:08.931 --> 02:08:14.735]  We have from 1.3 million in prison 10 years ago to 7 plus mil now in the criminal justice system.
[02:08:15.828 --> 02:08:17.069]  More people on welfare.
[02:08:17.210 --> 02:08:21.354]  More people in the psychiatric system and the criminal justice system.
[02:08:21.614 --> 02:08:23.737]  It's about institutionalization.
[02:08:24.157 --> 02:08:25.538]  Then you read the globalist documents.
[02:08:25.619 --> 02:08:29.222]  Once they've got the control grid fully in place, they actually talk about it.
[02:08:29.282 --> 02:08:34.268]  Even some of these peak oil people who are the little phony grassroots agents, they're out there talking about it.
[02:08:35.669 --> 02:08:38.570]  We've got IMF World Bank documents with Henry Kissinger.
[02:08:38.810 --> 02:08:40.371]  Sterilize your women or no money.
[02:08:40.631 --> 02:08:43.953]  We catch them putting stuff in the vaccines to sterilize the women.
[02:08:43.973 --> 02:08:45.714]  I mean, folks, this is real!
[02:08:46.514 --> 02:08:52.177]  And I want to go back to calls, but Dr. Begich just kind of in some bullet points in a couple minutes.
[02:08:52.897 --> 02:08:56.379]  What do you see happening if they win in 10 years and then 20?
[02:08:57.480 --> 02:09:00.762]  And the Pentagon calls it the hive mind, what he was mentioning earlier, folks.
[02:09:00.902 --> 02:09:01.502]  I didn't write it.
[02:09:01.822 --> 02:09:03.423]  They said matrix-like system.
[02:09:04.088 --> 02:09:05.309]  Plugs in all our heads.
[02:09:05.830 --> 02:09:07.411]  Literally, folks, I didn't say this.
[02:09:07.711 --> 02:09:09.913]  Plugging us into pleasure centers to control us.
[02:09:10.173 --> 02:09:11.615]  If we're good, we get the pleasure.
[02:09:13.797 --> 02:09:15.638]  You think drugs are bad that they control?
[02:09:15.838 --> 02:09:16.979]  This dwarfs those.
[02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:18.961]  This is right out of the Matrix.
[02:09:19.381 --> 02:09:21.483]  In fact, that movie is a lot of stuff that the government was planning.
[02:09:21.503 --> 02:09:22.804]  This sounds insane.
[02:09:23.405 --> 02:09:25.126]  What are they going to build if we don't stop them?
[02:09:25.427 --> 02:09:27.969]  Or what could things be like if we do stop them, and how do we stop them?
[02:09:28.975 --> 02:09:31.798]  Here's a really important, a couple of important points.
[02:09:31.858 --> 02:09:35.220]  You know, the issues of influencing human behavior and human memory.
[02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:38.163]  This is a big topic for us that we've covered over the years.
[02:09:38.223 --> 02:09:42.486]  In fact, it's a subject of a DVD we'll be releasing in the next week or so.
[02:09:43.067 --> 02:09:48.832]  But this concept of influencing human behavior using not just chemical means, you know,
[02:09:52.274 --> 02:09:55.175]  Psychoactive Drugs actually goes back to the early 90s.
[02:09:55.235 --> 02:10:00.437]  It was part of the first Bush administration's initiative, and it got killed.
[02:10:00.837 --> 02:10:03.138]  It was a $400 initiative that got killed.
[02:10:03.918 --> 02:10:05.198]  People might remember the U.S.
[02:10:05.738 --> 02:10:19.363]  News and World Report cover where it shows a little baby on the cover with a prison uniform on, and it was the idea that somehow crime was genetically based, and they were using this as the excuse to go into inner-city schools, interview teachers, figure out... I've got to stop you again.
[02:10:19.383 --> 02:10:20.463]  You bring up such good points.
[02:10:20.583 --> 02:10:22.244]  Three months ago, they had the hearings.
[02:10:22.284 --> 02:10:23.164]  We had reporters there.
[02:10:23.184 --> 02:10:24.404]  It was in the Associated Press.
[02:10:24.744 --> 02:10:27.745]  And they said, they said, why are over two-thirds on drugs?
[02:10:27.885 --> 02:10:33.967]  And the actual state psychiatrist and the head of the committee said, because their genetics are bad.
[02:10:34.308 --> 02:10:35.688]  I mean, this is eugenics.
[02:10:36.048 --> 02:10:36.248]  Yep.
[02:10:36.469 --> 02:10:40.091]  And this goes back to Nazi Germany concept.
[02:10:40.172 --> 02:10:42.233]  I mean, this is the kind of stuff they were doing there.
[02:10:42.714 --> 02:10:49.099]  The fact is, a number of people rose up against this back in the early 90s, and they killed it, only delayed it.
[02:10:49.199 --> 02:10:53.963]  You know, as these things go, they figure out where they were weak and where they were strong, and they re-spin the story.
[02:10:54.043 --> 02:10:54.863]  They're like the Borg.
[02:10:55.304 --> 02:10:55.544]  Right.
[02:10:55.584 --> 02:11:01.349]  Now, I'll give you an example of sort of the counter side of sort of the Redland part of the equation, at least that little component.
[02:11:01.729 --> 02:11:05.332]  In the Minneapolis School District, a number of years ago, they started a charter school
[02:11:05.892 --> 02:11:11.057]  Using a technique called neurobiofeedback or brain biofeedback, something that I've lectured on over the years.
[02:11:11.337 --> 02:11:14.499]  I have a good friend who was in NASA mind control programs as a child.
[02:11:15.140 --> 02:11:28.071]  But this particular technology, when it was applied, they could take a child and within 30 to 40 one-hour sessions teach the child by feedback how to control their brain activity without any chemicals.
[02:11:28.111 --> 02:11:32.835]  And what would happen is, after 20, 30 sessions, the kids were coming off of Ritalin
[02:11:34.247 --> 02:11:38.273]  80% of the school population at the end of the first year was off of all psychoactive drugs.
[02:11:38.293 --> 02:11:40.256]  They were put back into regular ed classes.
[02:11:40.677 --> 02:11:45.785]  They knew how to artificially, through their own mind, without any outside interference,
[02:11:46.494 --> 02:11:54.019]  Move their brain into those areas where you can learn, where you can accelerate, where you're not hyperactive or you're not lethargic, but you're right in that right area.
[02:11:54.359 --> 02:11:57.481]  Now, that's just a little computer training aid, and I have read the studies.
[02:11:57.981 --> 02:11:58.902]  No mind control.
[02:11:58.922 --> 02:12:00.883]  They're not doing anything to the brain.
[02:12:00.963 --> 02:12:05.486]  They show you little symbols and things, then you focus on them, and it teaches you how to control your brain.
[02:12:05.586 --> 02:12:07.428]  But, again, the double-edged sword.
[02:12:07.488 --> 02:12:15.833]  I have a friend who was in a magnet program and from elementary school was in a secret NASA program where they were doing bad things.
[02:12:16.213 --> 02:12:16.714]  Absolutely.
[02:12:16.754 --> 02:12:25.399]  And this is, again, when you start talking about the human brain, where you cross some lines that God won't even interfere with free will, yet man thinks he can and does.
[02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:29.322]  This type of technology, though, goes a little bit further.
[02:12:29.382 --> 02:12:40.469]  One of the things the military planned and looks forward to, and they mention it in SpaceCast 2020 and other documents, is this idea of creating artificial memory.
[02:12:40.769 --> 02:12:41.669]  Now think about that.
[02:12:41.689 --> 02:12:46.592]  And they're thinking about it from training techniques to... Well, that was in Wired News last year.
[02:12:46.612 --> 02:12:48.893]  It was called The Marshall Plan was the name of the article.
[02:12:48.933 --> 02:12:53.775]  And it was the futurist, you know, 89 years old, looks like Dr. Evil at the Pentagon.
[02:12:53.795 --> 02:12:57.576]  And he says in the future it won't be what weapons but what drugs we have.
[02:12:57.596 --> 02:12:59.257]  And then he talked about artificial memories.
[02:12:59.597 --> 02:13:07.841]  Well, and in this case, you know, we actually have almost 100 sources quoted in a book we wrote in 99 that draws all of this out.
[02:13:08.983 --> 02:13:17.828]  Again, we tend to dig into some of the more obscure journals to pull our data, but they're all top-line military journals that are public domain or academic reports.
[02:13:18.288 --> 02:13:19.349]  Here's where that goes.
[02:13:19.789 --> 02:13:26.753]  Think about training techniques that they're looking to evolve where instead of spending a year in class learning a language, they can dump it into your brain in a few moments.
[02:13:27.213 --> 02:13:28.534]  That's what they're looking for.
[02:13:28.614 --> 02:13:30.915]  Now, when you think about compulsory education,
[02:13:31.579 --> 02:13:44.656]  And you look at that concept, and when you dump information in the human brain in this way, you bypass the things that sort out good and evil, right and wrong, and you go straight in as if it's, according to one Russian scientist, as if it's the word of God.
[02:13:44.696 --> 02:13:48.180]  It cannot be avoided and it cannot be resisted.
[02:13:48.260 --> 02:13:50.343]  It's almost like a computer disk being overwritten.
[02:13:50.834 --> 02:13:57.860]  Right, and that's exactly a great analogy because think about this in the terms of forced education in the public system.
[02:13:57.880 --> 02:14:03.605]  You go there, unless you can pay for private schools, who develops the curriculum that goes in your kids' heads?
[02:14:03.706 --> 02:14:11.913]  Now, right now, kids come home with this stuff and you can sort it out and you can have your discussions in the household and maybe turn your kids back into the right direction.
[02:14:12.413 --> 02:14:20.035]  But when it's dumped in in this way, there will be no turning them into any direction, but the direction that the government decides they ought to go, because the curriculum is regulated by law.
[02:14:20.075 --> 02:14:21.075]  And this is how they'll sell it.
[02:14:21.115 --> 02:14:24.796]  The rich and cool will be able to get it at first, and, oh, no, you can't have it.
[02:14:25.076 --> 02:14:25.316]  Right.
[02:14:25.376 --> 02:14:33.318]  And then a few years later, they even have Army War College documents of how to sell it to us, and they even talk about how to have it fad-driven, security-driven.
[02:14:33.338 --> 02:14:34.598]  And, you know, I mentioned the hive mind.
[02:14:34.898 --> 02:14:37.279]  Three years ago, Sydney Morning Herald picked up on it.
[02:14:37.599 --> 02:14:40.240]  I called the scientist in the article, and she goes, I didn't even know this.
[02:14:40.260 --> 02:14:41.420]  This isn't supposed to be public.
[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:46.183]  I'm sure you saw that, where they describe how we're going to be a hive mind by 2025.
[02:14:46.983 --> 02:14:47.183]  Yep.
[02:14:47.464 --> 02:14:54.508]  And this technology and the drifts of the technology, if they're used correctly, can be great.
[02:14:54.568 --> 02:15:01.773]  But the power is vested in secret organizations under national security or by private corporations exploiting it for their own interests.
[02:15:02.233 --> 02:15:04.794]  And the fact is, we're the victims of this.
[02:15:04.835 --> 02:15:07.236]  People say, well, the American government won't victimize us.
[02:15:07.256 --> 02:15:08.657]  Secretary of Energy O'Leary said,
[02:15:08.837 --> 02:15:10.239]  Let's just give them one example of hundreds.
[02:15:10.279 --> 02:15:10.719]  Pregnant wives...
[02:15:23.292 --> 02:15:24.453]  She's at the military base.
[02:15:24.533 --> 02:15:25.894]  Oh, take some vitamins, honey.
[02:15:26.114 --> 02:15:27.194]  They're uranium pills.
[02:15:27.594 --> 02:15:28.755]  Then they say, come back and see us.
[02:15:28.795 --> 02:15:33.438]  When she comes in with a miscarriage, they roll film cameras in and start taping her having the miscarriage.
[02:15:33.538 --> 02:15:34.358]  Killing babies!
[02:15:34.638 --> 02:15:40.401]  Just because they're putting a young sergeant in a containment facility, spraying him with sarin gas.
[02:15:40.701 --> 02:15:41.182]  Killing him!
[02:15:41.542 --> 02:15:44.003]  Dr. Baggetts, where do they find researchers that will do this?
[02:15:44.443 --> 02:15:45.304]  Well, they protect them.
[02:15:45.564 --> 02:15:52.551]  You know, when you get information under a Freedom of Information Act, when it was valid and you could actually get something, they would delete all of the scientists' names.
[02:15:52.591 --> 02:16:01.921]  Because, you know, parents would look at it, and most of these people are in academic institutions, you know, they wouldn't want their kids taught by people engaging in the ethical behavior these guys do.
[02:16:01.941 --> 02:16:02.802]  They're insulated.
[02:16:02.862 --> 02:16:03.743]  Well, let me give you an example.
[02:16:03.823 --> 02:16:06.586]  I have a friend who's high level at the UT Psychology Department.
[02:16:07.086 --> 02:16:22.012]  That's all I'll say, and I was in there just doing a documentary because it has interesting hallways and places to do interviews, but most of the places classified, and I wasn't let into any classified areas, but everything I was allowed to see was DARPA this, DARPA that.
[02:16:22.052 --> 02:16:25.013]  It was all about mind control that wasn't even hidden.
[02:16:25.333 --> 02:16:33.776]  Well, you know, DARPA took over the HAARP project here in Alaska a year or so ago, and it's no longer run by the Air Force and Navy, which one of the objections that we've had
[02:16:34.284 --> 02:16:40.089]  And the European Parliament has had, and the Russian Duma has had, is the mind control capacity of this device.
[02:16:40.489 --> 02:16:45.574]  What is it, 90% of now college funding being run by the government?
[02:16:45.594 --> 02:16:47.395]  So that gives them total control over R&D?
[02:16:47.916 --> 02:16:48.556]  Absolutely.
[02:16:48.636 --> 02:16:51.799]  And what happens is it's a slow corruption.
[02:16:51.859 --> 02:16:52.980]  It happens over time.
[02:16:53.280 --> 02:16:55.202]  People get locked into these programs.
[02:16:55.782 --> 02:16:56.703]  They're making their living.
[02:16:56.723 --> 02:16:57.824]  They're raising their families.
[02:16:58.362 --> 02:17:02.789]  They find themselves increasingly, like one slice at a time, the frog boiling in the water.
[02:17:02.829 --> 02:17:04.751]  You don't know it until the water's boiling.
[02:17:05.472 --> 02:17:06.514]  And then they're locked in.
[02:17:07.976 --> 02:17:11.822]  It takes a very unusual person to be courageous enough to stand up
[02:17:12.296 --> 02:17:14.997]  And step out of that and go through the risks and the harassment.
[02:17:15.057 --> 02:17:22.438]  Aren't you naturally, though, also going to just see individuals that whatever they come up with, that will be just innately immune to it?
[02:17:22.859 --> 02:17:23.079]  Yep.
[02:17:23.239 --> 02:17:25.059]  And the other part is compartmentalization.
[02:17:25.079 --> 02:17:29.900]  A lot of people don't even know what the heck they're working on and how it feeds the next step in the process.
[02:17:29.940 --> 02:17:31.381]  And that often happens as well.
[02:17:31.621 --> 02:17:31.801]  All right.
[02:17:31.841 --> 02:17:34.301]  I promise we'll go straight to your calls on the other side.
[02:17:34.561 --> 02:17:36.982]  Riveting discussions with Dr. Nick Bagich.
[02:17:37.719 --> 02:17:40.665]  And I'll see if I can wrangle him to stay for the rest of the hour.
[02:17:40.686 --> 02:17:43.552]  We can talk about some other technology after we take calls.
[02:17:45.862 --> 02:17:49.763]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[02:17:49.983 --> 02:18:02.265]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:18:02.685 --> 02:18:03.085]  The U.S.
[02:18:03.125 --> 02:18:08.706]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[02:18:09.106 --> 02:18:11.307]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:18:13.187 --> 02:18:13.647]  We're good to go.
[02:18:34.017 --> 02:18:34.218]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:45.336 --> 02:18:48.817]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:18:49.077 --> 02:18:52.578]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:18:52.678 --> 02:18:56.619]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:18:56.859 --> 02:19:03.000]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:19:03.400 --> 02:19:11.302]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below defectable limits.
[02:19:11.722 --> 02:19:12.622]  We're good to go.
[02:19:37.773 --> 02:19:39.154]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:19:39.374 --> 02:19:43.455]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[02:19:44.116 --> 02:19:51.059]  Many people have wondered what has happened to the once great United States of America while the moral decay that has been taking place within it.
[02:19:52.319 --> 02:19:56.401]  The United States has been targeted for overthrow for world government.
[02:19:57.101 --> 02:20:04.144]  The United Nations has been established to redistribute the wealth of the world away from the United States, Great Britain and Western Europe.
[02:20:05.015 --> 02:20:13.799]  You need to know, as a specific individual citizen of the United States of America, why these things are happening and what you can do about it.
[02:20:14.440 --> 02:20:19.542]  We'd like to offer you a one-year absolutely free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:21:24.098 --> 02:21:25.018]  That's 1-877-928-8822.
[02:21:37.925 --> 02:21:52.030]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:21:52.510 --> 02:21:55.351]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:55.871 --> 02:22:01.373]  Coming up in the next segment, the Journal Times is a law needed to ban microchip implants in humans.
[02:22:02.777 --> 02:22:04.318]  Legislator is introducing the bill.
[02:22:04.358 --> 02:22:05.098]  Another one, U.S.
[02:22:05.178 --> 02:22:09.080]  Intel once considered using huge earthquake systems.
[02:22:09.200 --> 02:22:11.081]  World War II era top secret project.
[02:22:11.441 --> 02:22:13.863]  Talked of producing tsunamis with an A-bomb.
[02:22:14.523 --> 02:22:16.504]  We'll talk to Dr. Bagich about that coming up.
[02:22:18.579 --> 02:22:26.106]  Right now, let's go ahead and go to Roger in Pennsylvania, then Tim, Michael, other Tim hung up, Phil, and John.
[02:22:26.146 --> 02:22:28.148]  That'll be it for calls, those next five.
[02:22:28.909 --> 02:22:29.749]  Roger, go ahead.
[02:22:29.769 --> 02:22:31.191]  Yeah, thanks, Jensen.
[02:22:31.271 --> 02:22:36.716]  Even in the somewhat highbrow, atheist, behaviorist, determinist, you're not responsible for your self-circles.
[02:22:36.736 --> 02:22:39.739]  They're somewhat giving way to the retraining your brain.
[02:22:39.899 --> 02:22:43.022]  I think the catchphrase, if I recall, is the quantum zero effect.
[02:22:46.163 --> 02:22:54.510]  I'm not sure exactly what you're referring to, but the idea of influencing behavior technologically is something that we've been reporting on for years.
[02:22:54.851 --> 02:22:59.515]  It's an issue that we think is probably... I personally am committing the next five years to...
[02:23:00.135 --> 02:23:04.099]  Really pushing this issue into the public domain.
[02:23:04.139 --> 02:23:07.622]  I had a transhumanist on who said, you can't hold the rest of us up.
[02:23:07.802 --> 02:23:09.483]  We're going to make you take brain chips.
[02:23:10.004 --> 02:23:22.035]  Yeah, and I mean, this is, I think this is probably, the way we handled the harp issue in the 90s, we're going to handle the idea of influencing human behavior because we think people need to know what's out there.
[02:23:22.195 --> 02:23:25.818]  It's extremely important, the most invasive technology on the planet.
[02:23:26.238 --> 02:23:29.260]  And the delivery systems are incredible.
[02:23:29.280 --> 02:23:32.882]  I mean, you don't even have to go to a country to influence what can happen within it.
[02:23:32.982 --> 02:23:36.965]  If you can cook into their telecommunication systems or their energy grid.
[02:23:37.505 --> 02:23:47.731]  There was a great story that was done, a documentary on undercurrents, February 7, 1999, CBC TV in Canada, on mind control.
[02:23:47.751 --> 02:23:49.012]  They interviewed me as well as
[02:23:49.372 --> 02:23:52.054]  And don't think the crowd that puts sodium fluoride in your water won't use this.
[02:24:12.765 --> 02:24:26.952]  No, in fact, even in Zbigniew Brzezinski's book, he talks about mind-control technologies, and he said it doesn't matter who's in power, liberal or conservative, the temptation to use technology to further their political ends would be taken.
[02:24:27.052 --> 02:24:34.236]  And what about, at the same time, we have the soundwave cannons, the microwave cannons.
[02:24:34.716 --> 02:24:36.277]  They have the soundwave guns in New York.
[02:24:36.337 --> 02:24:37.058]  It's in my new film.
[02:24:37.638 --> 02:24:38.378]  Roger, I think?
[02:24:38.738 --> 02:24:41.780]  Alex, I called about Art Bell last night.
[02:24:42.416 --> 02:24:42.736]  Okay.
[02:24:42.876 --> 02:25:05.330]  Which was, my hack and cough kept me awake to hear him say that in honor of today's record high oil prices, which we all know is 99% the Illuminati theft of the wealth out of our dollar, a thought that never occurred to him at the time, so he's going to celebrate this fact by having a guest on to resurrect the
[02:25:07.494 --> 02:25:09.215]  Yeah, thanks for the call.
[02:25:09.255 --> 02:25:15.517]  I mean, it's not a myth because they're going to manufacture it, but there are record oil supplies.
[02:25:15.537 --> 02:25:16.477]  Thank you, Roger.
[02:25:17.198 --> 02:25:18.438]  Let's talk to Tim in Ohio.
[02:25:18.498 --> 02:25:19.118]  Tim, go ahead.
[02:25:19.358 --> 02:25:19.999]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:25:20.039 --> 02:25:20.739]  Excellent show today.
[02:25:21.219 --> 02:25:21.499]  Thank you.
[02:25:21.639 --> 02:25:23.420]  Dr. Pegg, it's quite an honor to speak with you, sir.
[02:25:23.460 --> 02:25:24.340]  Well, thank you very much.
[02:25:24.500 --> 02:25:32.983]  I wanted to ask you a question about a correlation, perhaps, between this new disease that's emerging called Morgellons disease and the chemtrails.
[02:25:33.729 --> 02:25:49.635]  I was doing some research on the internet and I saw some photos where this fibrous material, sometimes autofluorescent, blue and red, along with black granules were coming out of these pencil head sized eraser tip sores on people's bodies.
[02:25:49.676 --> 02:25:57.939]  A lot of them had had Lyme disease in the past and I was just wondering if there's any correlation at all because I know aluminum, quartz and carbon black are three of the
[02:25:59.817 --> 02:26:06.942]  Well, there's a lot of new, quote, diseases that they misdiagnose just because of all the toxic stuff they're putting into the environment.
[02:26:06.982 --> 02:26:07.943]  But Dr. Beggett's comments?
[02:26:08.243 --> 02:26:18.031]  Yeah, I think the idea of toxins contributing to changes in general health and the emergence of new diseases, I think, is a big part of it.
[02:26:18.071 --> 02:26:19.232]  But there's another component.
[02:26:19.252 --> 02:26:23.395]  A friend of mine at MIT, Nicholas Ashford, had done some work in this area.
[02:26:24.176 --> 02:26:27.118]  And actually, there's this whole controversy over false
[02:26:27.578 --> 02:26:44.643]  Well, I mean, that's in frogs, that's in fish, that's in humans, men, and I mean, they admit that's why eight-year-old girls look like they're 15 now?
[02:26:44.923 --> 02:26:54.766]  Yep, and what's happening when you add in, and I asked Nicholas about this, I said, you know, what happens when you add in the electromagnetic components, because you can actually enhance the
[02:26:55.206 --> 02:26:58.248]  And accelerate mutations.
[02:26:58.648 --> 02:27:01.829]  Yeah, and you can really create some huge, complex problems.
[02:27:01.889 --> 02:27:09.933]  And his statement to me was, Nick, I don't want to get into this because we're already having a hard enough time explaining this issue, much less complicating it.
[02:27:09.953 --> 02:27:13.895]  He goes, I understand the issue, but it's just too early to bring it out.
[02:27:14.215 --> 02:27:17.096]  Well, bottom line, don't drink out of plastic.
[02:27:17.837 --> 02:27:18.457]  Absolutely.
[02:27:19.157 --> 02:27:19.638]  Absolutely.
[02:27:19.678 --> 02:27:22.619]  You know, there are so many things we can do to enhance our health,
[02:27:22.987 --> 02:27:30.569]  We need to start paying attention to those things, build our health, build our potentials, and let's take the challenges to the next level, which is to change the way we see the world.
[02:27:30.589 --> 02:27:33.310]  We're going to take more calls when we get back and plunge into other news.
[02:27:35.831 --> 02:27:36.791]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.231 --> 02:27:38.852]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.752 --> 02:27:42.453]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.769 --> 02:27:49.452]  You've heard about PAWS from BioOx International and its Bubble Up technology.
[02:27:49.732 --> 02:27:54.036]  But have you heard about BioOx Citrus Concentrate that also uses Bubble Up technology?
[02:27:54.276 --> 02:28:01.202]  BioOx Citrus Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[02:28:01.582 --> 02:28:08.249]  It's a sad fact, but in just seconds, your carpet can be soiled with mud, your sofa ruined by pizza sauce, or your walls by color crayons.
[02:28:08.549 --> 02:28:12.012]  But in minutes, you can remove those problems with BioOx Citrus Concentrate.
[02:28:12.032 --> 02:28:12.813]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit BioOx.com.

[02:28:24.360 --> 02:28:31.062]  You can throw out all those bottles of harmful cleaning chemicals because it's just better to use BioOx Citrus Concentrate to clean your home.
[02:28:31.262 --> 02:28:35.923]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit BioOx.com.
[02:28:36.123 --> 02:28:38.664]  That's B-I-O-O-X dot com.
[02:28:38.804 --> 02:28:43.446]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use BioOx family of products.
[02:28:45.464 --> 02:28:51.707]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:28:51.847 --> 02:28:58.010]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:28:58.290 --> 02:29:06.674]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:29:06.954 --> 02:29:14.016]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:29:14.296 --> 02:29:19.117]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:29:19.338 --> 02:29:24.739]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:29:25.079 --> 02:29:28.120]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:29:28.480 --> 02:29:36.488]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:36.508 --> 02:29:37.068]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:45.106 --> 02:29:52.750]  If you're $10,000 in credit card debt or more and are making minimum monthly payments but getting nowhere, Debt Relief USA has the answer.
[02:29:52.890 --> 02:29:56.352]  Call 1-800-516-6567 now.
[02:29:56.512 --> 02:30:00.454]  Debt Relief USA has ways through special programs to reduce your principal and interest.
[02:30:00.734 --> 02:30:03.296]  You may qualify to reduce your credit card debt as much as 75%.
[02:30:03.336 --> 02:30:05.177]  Just call 1-800-516-6567 for a risk-free debt analysis.
[02:30:09.659 --> 02:30:10.260]  We're good to go.
[02:30:26.019 --> 02:30:31.661]  For the relief you need, Debt Relief USA is helping Americans re-secure their financial future one client at a time, excluding Maryland and New York.
[02:30:48.241 --> 02:30:54.262]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:30:54.882 --> 02:30:57.863]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:00.704 --> 02:31:04.905]  And now, Your Highness, we'll discuss the location of your hidden rebel base.
[02:31:05.765 --> 02:31:07.625]  Ah, pretty good voiceover, folks.
[02:31:07.645 --> 02:31:14.387]  That was done with no aid of any computer stuff here on the mixing board.
[02:31:14.992 --> 02:31:20.357]  Alright, just having some fun there with my little Marvin the Martian imitations.
[02:31:20.577 --> 02:31:25.402]  You know, you've got to have fun with this stuff every once in a while just to keep yourself happy.
[02:31:25.462 --> 02:31:27.364]  I mean, just because a lot of strange things are happening.
[02:31:27.724 --> 02:31:29.166]  It's also very, very exciting.
[02:31:29.946 --> 02:31:32.729]  We're about to go back to Dr. Begich and take three final calls.
[02:31:32.769 --> 02:31:36.813]  And then I want to get into tectonic, seismic, volcanic weapons.
[02:31:37.529 --> 02:31:39.310]  I want to get into incredible microchips.
[02:31:39.330 --> 02:31:45.115]  I want to get into several other issues with Dr. Bagich and tell you how you can get his new DVD that's coming out this week as well as his new book.
[02:31:46.396 --> 02:31:53.301]  But before we do that, my new film, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[02:31:53.481 --> 02:31:57.084]  That's the subtitle, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[02:31:57.725 --> 02:31:59.366]  It's really three different films in one.
[02:31:59.386 --> 02:32:04.849]  We've got the sound wave cannons, the surveillance blimps, the police arresting reporters and threatening to arrest us for no reason.
[02:32:05.229 --> 02:32:07.370]  We show you martial law in America.
[02:32:07.430 --> 02:32:16.935]  Then we cover 9-11 right there at ground zero, go over all the documents in a full hour, showing you how the globalists carried out 9-11.
[02:32:16.995 --> 02:32:25.180]  And then we spend an hour on their ideology, their philosophy, the Nazi-Bush connection, the Skull and Bones-Bohemian Grove connection to Schwarzenegger,
[02:32:25.860 --> 02:32:28.422]  Really, why they're so evil and why they do what they do.
[02:32:29.623 --> 02:32:35.688]  It's a group of predators who basically see us as a subspecies to be fed on.
[02:32:36.429 --> 02:32:38.831]  It's my best work ever, professionally produced.
[02:32:38.871 --> 02:32:39.672]  I mean, it's amazing.
[02:32:39.692 --> 02:32:39.672]  $25.95.
[02:32:40.352 --> 02:32:44.816]  And if you get a second copy, it's $19.95.
[02:32:44.856 --> 02:32:46.017]  A third copy is like $14.95.
[02:32:46.097 --> 02:32:49.740]  I mean, you can get three copies and give them as gifts.
[02:32:49.800 --> 02:32:51.041]  Get one copy if you want.
[02:32:51.441 --> 02:32:53.123]  Or just get one copy and make copies.
[02:32:53.163 --> 02:32:54.544]  Just please do it.
[02:32:56.030 --> 02:32:59.351]  My hope, my dream, what I love is warning people.
[02:32:59.391 --> 02:33:04.653]  That's why I say, go to my website, get a 15 cent a day membership at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:33:05.073 --> 02:33:07.714]  Download copies, burn them to CD, give them to people.
[02:33:08.154 --> 02:33:12.056]  Go print copies of my book, Ascent into Tyranny, Paul Watson's book, Order Out of Chaos.
[02:33:12.816 --> 02:33:16.097]  Go download my weekly TV shows that I do every week.
[02:33:16.790 --> 02:33:20.211]  Usually two shows a week that we load up onto prisonplanet.tv.
[02:33:20.532 --> 02:33:28.215]  Fifteen cents a day, you get all these books, all these videos, all my videos, all these TV reports, my best audio interviews from the radio show.
[02:33:28.895 --> 02:33:30.996]  You can download them, burn them, give them to people.
[02:33:31.656 --> 02:33:32.136]  Please!
[02:33:32.196 --> 02:33:33.337]  I just want to warn people.
[02:33:33.657 --> 02:33:37.158]  We can have such an effect, and those that you give them to, tell them to make copies.
[02:33:38.099 --> 02:33:40.079]  Because you've just got to show somebody the truth once.
[02:33:40.139 --> 02:33:44.101]  The globalists have to reapply their lies over and over again, because again, it's an illusion.
[02:33:45.856 --> 02:33:47.477]  The new film, Martial Law, is out.
[02:33:47.617 --> 02:33:49.138]  All my other videos are there as well.
[02:33:49.158 --> 02:33:49.779]  They're excellent.
[02:33:50.099 --> 02:33:52.040]  Big discounts on those we're still offering.
[02:33:52.561 --> 02:33:55.983]  So check those out when you're at Infowars.com in the secure shopping cart.
[02:33:56.023 --> 02:33:57.204]  Watch free clips of the films.

[02:34:47.186 --> 02:34:51.949]  Dr. Begich, let's go right back to the calls here quickly.
[02:34:52.409 --> 02:34:55.571]  Let's go ahead now and talk to the next caller.
[02:34:56.891 --> 02:34:59.493]  Let's talk to Michael in New York.
[02:35:00.760 --> 02:35:01.500]  Michael, go ahead.
[02:35:01.821 --> 02:35:02.841]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[02:35:03.081 --> 02:35:03.361]  Hello.
[02:35:03.521 --> 02:35:04.082]  Great show.
[02:35:04.682 --> 02:35:12.566]  Alex, looking forward to your new DVD, and I'm going to make copies, as I always do, and distribute them the best I can.
[02:35:12.846 --> 02:35:13.567]  Good.
[02:35:13.667 --> 02:35:17.929]  I want to get to the energy topic, but first, the last comment by the good doctor.
[02:35:18.649 --> 02:35:24.032]  It segues into something about a new book I'm writing, Secrets in the Fountain of Youth, The Art of Living.
[02:35:24.697 --> 02:35:35.425]  And it will give all the secrets to everybody in layman terms, so they can be invulnerable to ever getting sick, and if they follow all the laws and principles, they will... Let me just say this, sir.
[02:35:35.505 --> 02:35:40.768]  We're meant to die to leave room for the next wave of our progeny.
[02:35:41.128 --> 02:35:47.473]  Certainly we can extend life up to 150 years, and there's a lot of things we can do to help ourselves, and
[02:35:47.953 --> 02:35:53.957]  You know, just because we haven't taken care of ourselves, whether we're 10 years old or 50, doesn't mean we can't start reversing that.
[02:35:54.357 --> 02:35:56.538]  But, you know, you say you've got the fountain of youth?
[02:35:56.999 --> 02:35:58.139]  Yes, sir, Alex, you're right.
[02:35:58.179 --> 02:36:04.744]  We're all meant to die eventually, but it's the quality of life while we're here that matters, not the quantity per se.
[02:36:05.204 --> 02:36:10.347]  And, you know, the chemtrails, and we know we're being bombarded by the dark forces to destroy our health.
[02:36:10.367 --> 02:36:11.808]  Any questions or comments for our guests?
[02:36:14.187 --> 02:36:14.708]  Are you there, sir?
[02:36:14.848 --> 02:36:15.348]  Yes, yes.
[02:36:15.668 --> 02:36:16.990]  Well, now, with the energy.
[02:36:17.390 --> 02:36:26.458]  Okay, the doctor covered really well why these alternatives that exist, why they're suppressed still, and how come these inventors aren't allowed to get them out because of this thing called treason.
[02:36:26.858 --> 02:36:31.643]  But what we have to do now, Alex, is to show the people that they are the traitors.
[02:36:32.230 --> 02:36:34.973]  And demonstrate these technologies in videos.
[02:36:34.993 --> 02:36:39.938]  There's a video out called Zero Point Technology, demonstrating engines that run on water and so forth.
[02:36:40.378 --> 02:36:47.225]  Get the people now also aware of the fact that these technologies do exist.
[02:36:47.625 --> 02:36:53.671]  They are the traders for not letting us have access to them, letting the inventors sell them,
[02:36:55.136 --> 02:36:55.516]  I hear you.
[02:36:55.536 --> 02:36:56.117]  Thanks for the call.
[02:36:56.197 --> 02:36:57.157]  I've got really good points.
[02:36:57.517 --> 02:37:01.059]  We're just running low on time here with a lot of other callers and news I want to cover.
[02:37:01.079 --> 02:37:02.439]  I just want to say this about Zero Point.
[02:37:02.959 --> 02:37:05.580]  The globalists are masters of doing propaganda pieces.
[02:37:05.960 --> 02:37:18.985]  You know, 15 years ago or longer, they come out, oh, Zero Point, then they make a joke about how it was in a mayonnaise jar, make fun of it, then try to discredit it forever when all these top scientific publications admit this stuff's going on.
[02:37:19.005 --> 02:37:22.807]  They just don't have ways of properly tapping into it yet, Dr. Baggett's comments.
[02:37:22.987 --> 02:37:23.827]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:37:23.867 --> 02:37:36.814]  In fact, one of the big alternative conferences back in, I believe it was 2001 or 2002, NASA and Great Britain actually announced their projects in this type of energy research that have been going on for years.
[02:37:37.615 --> 02:37:51.021]  The reality is the technology will evolve if it hasn't already, and we just haven't gotten it into the mainstream, but it challenges the big multinational industrial complex that exists today based on an oil economy.
[02:37:51.061 --> 02:37:51.902]  The reality is
[02:37:52.560 --> 02:37:54.301]  These things don't change overnight.
[02:37:54.321 --> 02:37:58.865]  It takes time to produce equipment, produce things, and change energy systems.
[02:37:59.785 --> 02:38:04.028]  I think it's the control issue that's more important to these folks.
[02:38:04.068 --> 02:38:05.750]  Who will control that technology?
[02:38:06.130 --> 02:38:13.816]  Even companies, the big ones, are now investing millions into companies and buying up companies that are involved in alternatives.
[02:38:13.896 --> 02:38:15.537]  Right here in Austin, Texas they're doing it.
[02:38:15.737 --> 02:38:17.178]  Yep, and it's for two reasons.
[02:38:17.279 --> 02:38:30.711]  One is to suppress, and one is to make sure they get a market share at the end of the day in the event... Yeah, what they do is they take real technologies from my study, correct me if I'm wrong, and hybridize them to where they don't really work one-tenth as well, but the global is controlling.
[02:38:31.012 --> 02:38:32.913]  Yeah, I think that's absolutely true.
[02:38:33.314 --> 02:38:35.155]  The hydrogen economy is a prime example.
[02:38:35.175 --> 02:38:35.516]  There's a...
[02:38:35.796 --> 02:38:39.059]  Well, for those that don't get this, let me just say it again like I said last hour.
[02:38:53.192 --> 02:39:12.038]  It is admitted, major mainstream publications demonstrated, Chinese military buying it, our Pentagon buying it, they have cheap, effective solar cells that are five times, and are even smaller, more power than the best of the last generation.
[02:39:12.418 --> 02:39:22.881]  We could right now have the mass distributing solar cars that have full power, work wonderfully, no fuel involved, but they're not letting us have it.
[02:39:23.161 --> 02:39:24.241]  That's exactly it.
[02:39:24.602 --> 02:39:26.202]  That would revolutionize everything.
[02:39:26.542 --> 02:39:27.122]  It would.
[02:39:27.162 --> 02:39:31.064]  And these are just segments of what's happening.
[02:39:31.084 --> 02:39:32.324]  20-year-old technology.
[02:39:32.524 --> 02:39:32.724]  Yep.
[02:39:32.884 --> 02:39:43.688]  And when you look at what's now possible in independent labs, I mean, if somebody really comes through with some of the zero-point technologies, the only way they're going to make it in the mainstream is if they're given away for free.
[02:39:44.286 --> 02:39:44.546]  Yeah.
[02:39:44.586 --> 02:39:44.666]  Yep.
[02:40:10.197 --> 02:40:23.566]  Yeah, and again, when you look at, again, technologies, the opportunities in technology are fantastic for changing everything about what we do and how we do it in very positive ways, but that is not... And I think they're worried about being able to suppress it.
[02:40:23.586 --> 02:40:25.268]  That's why they're going to the police state right now.
[02:40:25.408 --> 02:40:25.828]  You bet.
[02:40:25.888 --> 02:40:26.789]  I mean, think about it.
[02:40:26.829 --> 02:40:35.995]  If human beings, instead of using 6% or 8% of our brains, could use 50% or 60% of our brains, and some of the technology that's emerging might allow us to do some of this,
[02:40:36.696 --> 02:40:38.257]  You are not a controlled person.
[02:40:38.457 --> 02:40:46.901]  You are someone with an incredible potential that no longer can be influenced by these sound bites that come across the media.
[02:40:46.961 --> 02:40:51.304]  You're a thinking person then fully engaged and living as a human being was intended to.
[02:40:51.324 --> 02:40:53.625]  I don't know if I want to be 60% smarter.
[02:40:54.185 --> 02:41:00.851]  Well, it's a matter of... I mean, I don't even think I'm that smart now, but man, my brain's got so much stuff bouncing around in it.
[02:41:01.311 --> 02:41:03.813]  But it's the whole issue of organizing it.
[02:41:03.873 --> 02:41:16.183]  And you know, that's where a lot of the technologies that support enhancing human performance, where we're in control of what goes on, whether we're addressing, as the last caller said, the very simple health issues or more complex things,
[02:41:16.801 --> 02:41:22.825]  We need the power vested in individuals, not vested in governments with some centralized beehive mentality.
[02:41:22.865 --> 02:41:23.466]  You're right.
[02:41:23.586 --> 02:41:24.587]  Let's take two final calls.
[02:41:24.607 --> 02:41:26.028]  I've got to really hurry here.
[02:41:26.648 --> 02:41:30.191]  Then I want to hit those two final items, the microchips and the seismic weapons with you.
[02:41:30.851 --> 02:41:34.193]  Let's talk to Phillip in Virginia.
[02:41:34.213 --> 02:41:34.714]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:41:35.734 --> 02:41:38.977]  Yes, I've got to catch my second breath here with all the ground you've covered.
[02:41:38.997 --> 02:41:40.458]  You've really worn me out.
[02:41:41.879 --> 02:41:43.440]  Alex Jones, you're a great Texan.
[02:41:43.460 --> 02:41:45.461]  Nick Begich, you're a great Alaskan.
[02:41:45.822 --> 02:41:46.242]  Well, thanks.
[02:41:48.862 --> 02:41:59.626]  Is there any truth to the fact or to the report that I heard that George Herbert Walker Bush bought into all the oil tankers that supply the United States?
[02:42:00.446 --> 02:42:01.587]  He bought into a bunch of them.
[02:42:02.107 --> 02:42:03.247]  Prior to 9-11?
[02:42:03.347 --> 02:42:05.428]  Yeah.
[02:42:05.808 --> 02:42:08.909]  That I'm not familiar with, but Alex apparently is.
[02:42:09.029 --> 02:42:11.770]  They've been bought into oil tankers for decades.
[02:42:12.851 --> 02:42:15.452]  Well, the report was that he really bought...
[02:42:18.680 --> 02:42:21.881]  Well, they're bought into the big private prison companies.
[02:42:21.901 --> 02:42:23.922]  They're bought into the military companies.
[02:42:23.962 --> 02:42:27.704]  I mean, they said the Cold War is over, defense stocks are dead.
[02:42:27.964 --> 02:42:32.846]  Then the Carlaw Group bought them all up, you know, in the early 90s, and then now they jacked them back up.
[02:42:32.906 --> 02:42:35.027]  They know what they're doing with insider knowledge.
[02:42:35.047 --> 02:42:35.507]  We know that.
[02:42:35.967 --> 02:42:37.828]  This is the epitome of evil, folks.
[02:42:39.529 --> 02:42:42.470]  But suppressing the technology to keep us in the bondage.
[02:42:42.850 --> 02:42:43.931]  But just...
[02:42:44.884 --> 02:42:49.228]  Great program, and you guys, just may Yahweh be with you.
[02:42:49.388 --> 02:42:50.489]  Well, God bless you, my friend.
[02:42:50.509 --> 02:42:50.909]  Thank you.
[02:42:51.430 --> 02:42:57.555]  No, I mean, folks, I mean, they try to push these little solar cars that go 50 miles an hour on us and don't work.
[02:42:58.115 --> 02:43:00.437]  I would love a solar car, and they've got them.
[02:43:00.457 --> 02:43:04.401]  I mean, they've got the technology where you're talking no more fuel, folks.
[02:43:07.043 --> 02:43:08.184]  That's unbelievable.
[02:43:08.284 --> 02:43:08.444]  Yep.
[02:43:09.045 --> 02:43:15.618]  Yeah, it's just a matter of really seeing the technologies work for us.
[02:43:15.679 --> 02:43:18.204]  And there's so many things working against us right now.
[02:43:18.908 --> 02:43:24.972]  Fortunately, there's still enough independent scientists out there where we may still see some of these breakthroughs happen, whether they like it or not.
[02:43:27.094 --> 02:43:29.336]  Especially if there's rogue nations that don't play ball.
[02:43:29.556 --> 02:43:30.556]  That's exactly it.
[02:43:30.616 --> 02:43:36.240]  And you know that interfering with everyone else's sovereignty shouldn't be the business of the United States unless our own is threatened.
[02:43:36.280 --> 02:43:37.922]  And that's something else that we've forgotten.
[02:43:38.002 --> 02:43:41.444]  And our sovereignty is threatened by those that are running this New World Order.
[02:43:41.464 --> 02:43:42.605]  They're getting rid of our sovereignty.
[02:43:42.885 --> 02:43:43.426]  Absolutely.
[02:43:43.506 --> 02:43:45.207]  A slice at a time to the point where
[02:43:45.666 --> 02:43:50.687]  You're talking about legislation at the local level on implant technologies?
[02:43:50.747 --> 02:43:52.467]  It'll be preempted at the national level.
[02:43:53.427 --> 02:43:58.928]  These things can be done at the local level, and they should be, because at least it starts to generate the kind of debate that ought to happen.
[02:43:58.968 --> 02:44:02.569]  Over 400 cities have thrown out the Patriot Act, and now they're panicking.
[02:44:02.969 --> 02:44:04.169]  Let's take a final call.
[02:44:04.229 --> 02:44:05.469]  John in Tennessee, go ahead.
[02:44:05.489 --> 02:44:08.750]  Alex, I think this is a very good topic today.
[02:44:10.670 --> 02:44:14.011]  You guys are right on point when you're talking about a lot of this stuff that's suppressed.
[02:44:14.031 --> 02:44:14.911]  There was an article...
[02:44:15.962 --> 02:44:16.762]  It works.
[02:44:16.822 --> 02:44:19.183]  It's been replicated over 6,000 times across the planet.
[02:44:38.135 --> 02:44:38.655]  It works.
[02:44:38.775 --> 02:44:42.837]  Now the question is, can they get enough energy out of it to run a machine?
[02:44:42.877 --> 02:44:51.599]  And when you don't take it seriously, none of those big dollars from the think tanks in the world and the academic institutions or governments flow into the research.
[02:44:52.420 --> 02:44:56.501]  But they're already gearing up to try to depress people from actually being able to use this on their own.
[02:44:56.521 --> 02:44:58.421]  This is from this article.
[02:44:58.782 --> 02:45:06.364]  It was saying, Marlowe told PM that scores of cold fusion experiments have revealed the production of enriched uranium or tritium.
[02:45:07.128 --> 02:45:10.938]  And so then they... Oh, Al-Qaeda's... Right, right.
[02:45:11.118 --> 02:45:16.251]  The same tabletop devices that fulfill mankind's dream of creating unlimited quantities of cheap power.
[02:45:16.718 --> 02:45:22.280]  Yeah, we've got to control them or Al-Qaeda's going to get us.
[02:45:22.400 --> 02:45:22.860]  Exactly.
[02:45:23.240 --> 02:45:24.400]  So they've already geared up.
[02:45:24.780 --> 02:45:28.482]  And, you know, most of these reactors work on having a palladium cell.
[02:45:28.502 --> 02:45:29.742]  I think that's the name.
[02:45:30.142 --> 02:45:31.943]  Yeah, so they're planning.
[02:45:32.263 --> 02:45:36.484]  My prediction is they're planning to say, oh, this is a restricted material nobody can have.
[02:45:36.524 --> 02:45:43.546]  Well, they've already grabbed, you know, look, Dr. Baggage is a real environmentalist, and he just told you, and we have the documents on this last hour.
[02:45:44.326 --> 02:45:51.496]  That the big environmental groups are controlled by big foundations to grab resources so they're off limits so we can't develop them.
[02:45:51.656 --> 02:45:54.300]  And so they'll just grab the areas where this is mined.
[02:45:54.904 --> 02:45:55.864]  Yeah, exactly right.
[02:45:55.904 --> 02:45:57.805]  And over time, they'll come back out.
[02:45:57.865 --> 02:46:01.727]  And it's not the little guy in these environmental groups that even has a clue.
[02:46:02.127 --> 02:46:08.790]  They're doing some great work when really what they're doing is they're the bank clerk for the next multinational company's hijacking.
[02:46:08.810 --> 02:46:15.632]  Well, look at who funds all the environmental shows or the environmental message on every animal show, every technology show.
[02:46:15.852 --> 02:46:17.133]  Look at National Geographic.
[02:46:17.533 --> 02:46:19.294]  That thing's paid for by Dutch Shell.
[02:46:19.634 --> 02:46:19.814]  Yep.
[02:46:20.276 --> 02:46:24.577]  Yep, and you'll see it through most of these programs, and it's just more propaganda.
[02:46:24.998 --> 02:46:34.541]  Here in Alaska, we're an oil-producing state, and there in Texas, where you're an oil-producing state, I'm sure you get your share of what a great partnership we have with these guys as well, and it's just propaganda.
[02:46:34.581 --> 02:46:38.682]  You know, one guy in the oil industry said here to one of the labor leaders in this state,
[02:46:39.162 --> 02:46:42.846]  If you had the money that we had, you could own this legislature, too.
[02:46:43.287 --> 02:46:53.457]  And that tells it all, because this is the most bought and paid for legislature in the country, and it's bought with oil dollars, and it's the most corrupted legislature that's ever been in the history of this state.
[02:46:53.558 --> 02:46:54.679]  They're buying it with your money.
[02:46:54.699 --> 02:46:55.359]  Thanks for the call.
[02:46:56.060 --> 02:46:57.542]  We've got a minute and a half before we break here.
[02:46:57.562 --> 02:46:58.483]  Implantable chips.
[02:46:58.983 --> 02:46:59.824]  Got the headline.
[02:47:00.324 --> 02:47:03.347]  It's the law needed to ban microchip implants in humans.
[02:47:03.867 --> 02:47:08.591]  Representative Marlon Schneider doesn't want government getting under your skin.
[02:47:08.631 --> 02:47:15.536]  The Wisconsin Rapids Democrat is introducing a bill that would prohibit anyone, including government employees, from acquiring microchip implants in people.
[02:47:16.394 --> 02:47:18.435]  Other applications aren't regulated by the FDA.
[02:47:18.835 --> 02:47:27.679]  Applied digital tout security, defense homeland security, and making travelers have chips to access their luggage, flights and airlines, law enforcement records.
[02:47:28.179 --> 02:47:30.760]  The Mexican Attorney General makes his employees take them.
[02:47:31.560 --> 02:47:34.662]  I mean, we're talking about having to have laws now to block this.
[02:47:35.042 --> 02:47:35.642]  Absolutely.
[02:47:35.702 --> 02:47:38.643]  And you know, this is exactly what's happening.
[02:47:39.004 --> 02:47:42.305]  Identity theft is going to be used as the fear button to make this happen.
[02:47:42.765 --> 02:47:48.787]  They're already hyping it as the biggest crime in America, but it's also the least prosecuted crime in America.
[02:47:48.827 --> 02:47:51.228]  Well, they've created the platform that has allowed this.
[02:47:51.508 --> 02:47:58.591]  Yep, and the ability to track this kind of fraud is certainly there, because most of it's electronic, and you can track those transactions.
[02:47:58.631 --> 02:47:59.451]  They do it already.
[02:47:59.911 --> 02:48:11.876]  But the reality is it creates a sense of fear and anxiety that feeds on itself to the point where better and better IDs are required by the masses, to the point where implant technologies will be thought of as the only way
[02:48:12.597 --> 02:48:20.083]  You can look at the Revolution of Military Affairs and Conflicts Short of War, and it tells it all, and it's over now 16 years old.
[02:48:21.304 --> 02:48:25.947]  All right, I want to talk about seismic weapons as we wrap up this transmission against tyranny.
[02:48:27.548 --> 02:48:33.493]  Unbelievable, this interview has been powerful, and it will be posted at presentplanet.tv.
[02:48:33.633 --> 02:48:33.933]  U.S.
[02:48:33.993 --> 02:48:36.195]  intel once considered causing huge quake.
[02:48:36.795 --> 02:48:41.499]  Top secret project talked of producing tsunamis with nuclear weapons.
[02:48:41.539 --> 02:48:42.039]  We'll be back.
[02:48:45.535 --> 02:48:49.861]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.061 --> 02:48:54.467]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:54.628 --> 02:48:58.994]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.034 --> 02:49:00.416]  The New World Order.
[02:49:02.183 --> 02:49:06.408]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.468 --> 02:49:13.418]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.538 --> 02:49:15.600]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:15.801 --> 02:49:15.941]  Oh!
[02:49:16.001 --> 02:49:21.185]  If you want to understand what the new rule order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:51:24.486 --> 02:51:25.006]  We blast out.
[02:51:51.385 --> 02:51:53.631]  On the AM and FM dial, a lot of great new affiliates.
[02:51:53.651 --> 02:51:55.537]  I want to thank all of them for carrying the broadcast.
[02:51:56.660 --> 02:51:58.966]  Global shortwave during the day, the first two hours at 9.9.
[02:52:01.408 --> 02:52:02.668]  8-5, third hour, 9.975.
[02:52:02.708 --> 02:52:06.249]  And at night, 9 to midnight, 3210.
[02:52:07.370 --> 02:52:09.230]  And the internet at InfoWars.com.
[02:52:09.750 --> 02:52:16.552]  Dr. Beggars, before we get into seismic weapons in the last few minutes, tell folks again about your new book and also those two DVDs that are coming out.
[02:52:16.952 --> 02:52:17.112]  Right.
[02:52:17.152 --> 02:52:21.173]  We have two new DVDs, one on mind control technologies.
[02:52:21.193 --> 02:52:22.353]  It's about an hour and a half.
[02:52:22.874 --> 02:52:28.375]  It also has a CD that goes with it that has some of the ancillary materials from the documents we've talked about today.
[02:52:29.196 --> 02:52:32.158]  We also have another one coming out at the same time.
[02:52:32.198 --> 02:52:33.459]  These will be released next week.
[02:52:33.499 --> 02:52:34.340]  They'll start shipping.
[02:52:35.080 --> 02:52:42.145]  The other one is on the updates on HAARP, cell phone technologies, underwater sonars, and privacy-related technologies.
[02:52:42.846 --> 02:52:45.308]  Again, with a CD and a DVD paired up.
[02:52:45.688 --> 02:52:51.672]  Every time they test one of these sonars all over the place, whales and beach themselves, and they go, oh, it doesn't hurt them.
[02:52:52.052 --> 02:52:52.313]  Right.
[02:52:52.333 --> 02:52:56.075]  And then we have the book Earth Rising 2, which is the latest book we have out.
[02:52:56.095 --> 02:52:58.497]  It actually has a chapter dedicated to those subjects.
[02:52:59.105 --> 02:53:09.551]  And then the book, Earth, Rise, and the Revolution, which we consider our classic, deals not just with mind control technologies, updates on HAARP, and major issues on privacy technology.
[02:53:09.991 --> 02:53:17.475]  We also talk about this quote by William Cohen from 97 and this whole idea of manipulating a geophysical event.
[02:53:17.515 --> 02:53:21.337]  Before we give you that quote, fire out your phone number.
[02:53:21.397 --> 02:53:21.637]  Sure.
[02:53:21.737 --> 02:53:21.937]  It's 888-690-1277.
[02:53:26.078 --> 02:53:28.739]  And people can get a free catalog there of all of our publications.
[02:53:29.179 --> 02:53:32.500]  Give it again, please.
[02:53:32.520 --> 02:53:32.800]  888-690-1277.
[02:53:33.060 --> 02:53:34.561]  Or earthpulse.com?
[02:53:34.941 --> 02:53:35.521]  That's correct.
[02:53:35.861 --> 02:53:37.021]  All right, earthpulse.com.
[02:53:37.862 --> 02:53:38.602]  Seismic weapons.
[02:53:38.662 --> 02:53:42.403]  Cohen says, yeah, in the future it's going to be seismic and volcanic weapons.
[02:53:42.423 --> 02:53:43.523]  You got that quote in front of you?
[02:53:43.543 --> 02:53:44.023]  Yeah, it is.
[02:53:44.063 --> 02:53:52.926]  It says, others are engaging even in a type of eco-terrorism whereby they can alter climates, set off earthquakes and volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves.
[02:53:53.687 --> 02:53:57.851]  This is a quote from a conference on international terrorism and weapons of mass destruction from 1997.
[02:53:58.431 --> 02:54:01.954]  That was picked up by the AP, by the way.
[02:54:01.974 --> 02:54:02.454]  Right.
[02:54:02.474 --> 02:54:13.023]  We wrote about it back in 1999, again, to bring attention to the idea that if the technology is so unsophisticated that terrorist states can have it, you can only imagine what we have.
[02:54:13.203 --> 02:54:21.329]  Well, it's like Dick Cheney in the September 2000 peanut document says we need to legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons to target certain races.
[02:54:21.569 --> 02:54:23.190]  He should be arrested immediately.
[02:54:23.290 --> 02:54:28.134]  He's saying he wants to get us used to accepting race weapons.
[02:54:28.534 --> 02:54:35.860]  Yep, and the technology exists to be able to genetically target blacks or Middle Easterners or Orientals.
[02:54:36.280 --> 02:54:36.860]  Or whites.
[02:54:37.581 --> 02:54:38.842]  Or whites, absolutely.
[02:54:39.278 --> 02:54:53.422]  And, you know, when you look at all this technology, you know, in terms of environmental manipulation, there was actually a treaty we signed back in 1977 where we agreed to not use these technologies for creating tsunamis or volcanic eruptions.
[02:54:53.442 --> 02:54:57.723]  What about this news that first surfaced days after the tsunami and has now admitted the U.S.
[02:54:58.083 --> 02:55:02.024]  had a secret program and said it was feasible to create tsunamis?
[02:55:02.524 --> 02:55:05.466]  There's no question about the ability to do it.
[02:55:05.666 --> 02:55:06.707]  That's the 1946.
[02:55:06.747 --> 02:55:07.768]  Right.
[02:55:08.008 --> 02:55:11.771]  And this goes back to using atomic weapons for creating that effect.
[02:55:12.231 --> 02:55:13.792]  But you don't need to do that.
[02:55:13.832 --> 02:55:25.320]  And that's what this new science is showing, is that if you create, if you have already unstable areas, and you add energy in, in the form of electromagnetic waves, you can trigger these events.
[02:55:25.700 --> 02:55:27.842]  It's like the primer on a bullet.
[02:55:27.922 --> 02:55:30.544]  The primer doesn't release very much energy.
[02:55:30.584 --> 02:55:31.925]  It's the gunpowder that does.
[02:55:32.325 --> 02:55:33.906]  And the same is true in the planet.
[02:55:34.006 --> 02:55:36.847]  It's not... The planet is the holder of the energy.
[02:55:36.967 --> 02:55:42.669]  It's man that can tickle that just enough to release it, to burst it forward, just like a primer on a paper.
[02:55:42.689 --> 02:55:43.369]  Last question.
[02:55:43.409 --> 02:55:46.571]  Your gut level, what do you think happened with the megaquake?
[02:55:46.871 --> 02:55:48.171]  And then now the new quakes.
[02:55:48.651 --> 02:55:53.413]  Well, you know, my personal view is it's probably natural, but we've not seen anything yet.
[02:55:53.813 --> 02:55:55.954]  And a good deal of this could be... That's what I think.
[02:55:55.974 --> 02:55:57.535]  Do you think it's caused by the sun heating up?
[02:55:58.115 --> 02:56:00.836]  I think the sun is certainly having a factor.
[02:56:00.856 --> 02:56:04.456]  There's some Earth shifts happening, and that's the subject for probably another program.
[02:56:04.476 --> 02:56:09.818]  But there's a lot going on within the planet that is going to change everything that we know.
[02:56:09.838 --> 02:56:12.758]  All right, Dr. Bagich, incredible having you on.
[02:56:13.178 --> 02:56:15.959]  I want to get you up a little bit more than once a year, my friend.
[02:56:16.199 --> 02:56:16.679]  Absolutely.
[02:56:16.719 --> 02:56:20.020]  I'm always available to you, Alex, and I appreciate you putting these issues on the air.
[02:56:20.160 --> 02:56:22.320]  And God bless your audience, and God bless your family.
[02:56:22.500 --> 02:56:23.121]  You too, sir.
[02:56:23.141 --> 02:56:25.121]  Vaya con Dios.
