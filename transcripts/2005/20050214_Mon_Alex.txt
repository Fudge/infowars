[00:00:07.641 --> 00:00:08.302]  Big Brother.
[00:00:08.963 --> 00:00:10.004]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:10.724 --> 00:00:11.865]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:12.486 --> 00:00:13.327]  You want answers?
[00:00:14.067 --> 00:00:14.968]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.273]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:19.813 --> 00:00:23.917]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.586 --> 00:00:43.894]  The 14th day, my friends, the 14th day of February 2005, Valentine's Day.
[00:00:43.914 --> 00:00:45.596]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:46.116 --> 00:00:47.677]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:48.458 --> 00:00:51.040]  The worst fire in Madrid's history.
[00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:58.106]  A 32-story skyscraper burned for two days and did not collapse.
[00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:12.096]  It burned from about the 22nd floor up to the top and burned below that as well, exposing about half the building completely to the outside atmosphere.
[00:01:12.956 --> 00:01:15.999]  That is, it was just a burned-out shell over about half the building.
[00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:19.021]  But still, the building didn't collapse.
[00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:21.663]  And I sat there watching the news, reading the news reports,
[00:01:22.637 --> 00:01:30.862]  As they talked about the imminent collapse, why it happened at the World Trade Centers, it happened at Building 7, it's going to collapse, collapse, collapse, collapse.
[00:01:30.903 --> 00:01:34.385]  And then when it didn't collapse, they said, well, part of it collapsed.
[00:01:35.285 --> 00:01:49.495]  Well, yes, up at the top, some of the small supports in the ceilings, the sheetrock, some of the floors fell in with all of their office equipment, but none of the major support beams.
[00:01:50.996 --> 00:01:54.997]  Because a modern steel building has never collapsed from fire.
[00:01:55.658 --> 00:01:57.958]  Not in Caracas four or five months ago.
[00:01:57.978 --> 00:02:00.799]  Not in Madrid over the weekend.
[00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.859]  Never!
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.620]  These suckers can burn for a week!
[00:02:05.341 --> 00:02:11.022]  And if it's a really hot fire like this one was, I mean, orange flames blasting out.
[00:02:11.082 --> 00:02:12.883]  You saw it on television, most of you.
[00:02:13.683 --> 00:02:15.764]  Blasting out, you know, a hundred feet.
[00:02:16.573 --> 00:02:19.695]  Then maybe a few supports begin to sag.
[00:02:20.115 --> 00:02:24.357]  Smaller supports that don't support the structure, that just support the walls.
[00:02:25.918 --> 00:02:26.819]  And that's what happened.
[00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:37.225]  But, on September 11th, Building 7 has some small fires in it, and it collapses perfectly after just a few hours.
[00:02:38.385 --> 00:02:39.306]  It's magical!
[00:02:40.486 --> 00:02:41.047]  So, we'll
[00:02:42.136 --> 00:02:43.837]  Talk about that a little bit today.
[00:02:43.857 --> 00:02:45.018]  Of course, it's not magical.
[00:02:45.058 --> 00:02:49.662]  Larry Silverstein says that they blew up Building 7 and everybody just ignores it.
[00:02:50.542 --> 00:03:01.631]  Two new patients may hold clues to potent new HIV virus that supposedly causes AIDS strain in New York City.
[00:03:01.651 --> 00:03:03.272]  This is a pretty scary report.
[00:03:03.772 --> 00:03:06.474]  We'll be getting into that also here in about 25 minutes.
[00:03:06.535 --> 00:03:08.176]  We have the mother
[00:03:09.108 --> 00:03:20.730]  of a 13-year-old at Ritten Elementary School, which is now requiring students to wear radio frequency identification around their necks at all times.
[00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:23.971]  Then we have another mother coming on.
[00:03:23.991 --> 00:03:33.753]  In the next hour, Cindy Sheehan, who lost her son in Iraq, and we'll get her perspective on what it's like
[00:03:34.372 --> 00:03:37.834]  to lose a loved one in this war and kind of review what's happened.
[00:03:38.274 --> 00:03:42.676]  Also, Bush likes to kiss his nominees on the lips.
[00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:45.337]  Rice and several others.
[00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:48.759]  Well, now he's taken to kissing men as well.
[00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:52.440]  Kind of slipping up.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.121]  That's for Bohemian Grove, Bush.
[00:03:54.141 --> 00:03:55.202]  That's not for in public.
[00:03:55.962 --> 00:03:59.344]  But just kissing Lieberman on the cheek.
[00:03:59.584 --> 00:04:00.144]  That's all.
[00:04:01.076 --> 00:04:03.697]  And this was pointed out and now he wants Lieberman.
[00:04:03.777 --> 00:04:13.299]  The Washington Post is saying Lieberman may replace in the next six months to the next year Lord Rumsfeld at the Defense Department.
[00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.020]  So we'll talk about that.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.461]  And Russia and China are spying on the U.S.
[00:04:18.581 --> 00:04:19.421]  at a record level.
[00:04:21.201 --> 00:04:23.682]  And it turns out that the former Russian spy chief
[00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:29.033]  New of West Germ War Secrets and says that they have people in the heart of U.S.
[00:04:29.453 --> 00:04:31.194]  germ warfare labs right now.
[00:04:32.455 --> 00:04:34.197]  And also, report details U.S.
[00:04:34.257 --> 00:04:35.998]  spy flights over Iran.
[00:04:36.018 --> 00:04:40.261]  CNN's been caught putting out doctored photos, as usual.
[00:04:41.642 --> 00:04:45.145]  And, uh, just so much more, it is all coming up.
[00:04:45.245 --> 00:04:49.028]  Brain-damaged woman talks after 20 years.
[00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:52.050]  Being in a coma.
[00:04:53.092 --> 00:04:56.133]  There's discussions of UN troops taking over the US and Iraq.
[00:04:56.894 --> 00:04:59.495]  It's all coming up, so stay with us.
[00:04:59.515 --> 00:04:59.935]  We'll be back.
[00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:07.498]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:07.658 --> 00:05:12.080]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.621]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:16.661 --> 00:05:17.982]  The New World Order.
[00:05:18.802 --> 00:05:19.743]  Hammered!
[00:05:19.784 --> 00:05:24.008]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:24.068 --> 00:05:31.016]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:31.136 --> 00:05:33.139]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:43.925]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:44.125 --> 00:05:49.508]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:05:50.008 --> 00:05:53.230]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.051]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:06:02.555 --> 00:06:06.036]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.
[00:06:06.296 --> 00:06:09.776]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:06:09.876 --> 00:06:13.817]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:06:14.037 --> 00:06:20.198]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:20.598 --> 00:06:28.520]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.286]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:06:34.446 --> 00:06:38.209]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.432]  And the Black Berkey Filters are reclainable.
[00:06:40.492 --> 00:06:42.694]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:06:42.914 --> 00:06:47.839]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91, or a 4-pack for only $173.

[00:06:54.609 --> 00:06:56.233]  That's 808-803-44438 and protect your family.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.141]  Hi, I'm Ron.
[00:07:02.281 --> 00:07:04.643]  I'm taking collagen aids from Finman Vigor.
[00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:08.227]  And I have taken 20 pounds off and 6 inches off my waist.
[00:07:08.447 --> 00:07:08.808]  It works.
[00:07:08.968 --> 00:07:11.631]  I've gone down 35 pounds!
[00:07:11.911 --> 00:07:17.657]  And I've got energy and vitality that I never dreamed that I would ever have again.
[00:07:17.737 --> 00:07:21.541]  I'm going to be 51 years old and I feel as good as I did when I was 35.
[00:07:22.422 --> 00:07:23.523]  And I look that good, too.
[00:07:24.464 --> 00:07:24.805]  That's great!
[00:07:25.065 --> 00:07:26.086]  You can lose weight too.
[00:07:26.326 --> 00:07:33.354]  Call Vim and Vigor today at 1-800-622-FIN and learn how you can lose weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate.
[00:07:33.694 --> 00:07:34.375]  No ephedra.
[00:07:34.515 --> 00:07:35.276]  No stimulants.
[00:07:35.636 --> 00:07:39.000]  Our track record is proof that Vim and Vigor's Collagenate really works.
[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.762]  Call Vim and Vigor today at 1-800-622-FIN.
[00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:46.046]  And get $25 off a 3 month supply of Collagenate.
[00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:51.170]  Lose fat, get toned, and enjoy the many anti-aging benefits of Vim and Vigor's Collagenate.
[00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:51.250]  1-800-622-8446.
[00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:51.790]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:52.070]  Call today!
[00:08:03.889 --> 00:08:06.071]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:06.651 --> 00:08:09.454]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:29.978 --> 00:08:34.462]  Welcome back, now to the second segment, 8 minutes 30 seconds into the first hour.
[00:08:34.602 --> 00:08:36.583]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:37.484 --> 00:08:53.676]  Coming up here in about 20 minutes, we'll be talking to a mother who's fighting back at the local elementary school where they're making the children wear RFID tracker badges around their necks.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:59.702]  Then, of course, in the next hour, Cindy Sheehan, who lost her son in Iraq.
[00:08:59.742 --> 00:09:02.543]  And in the third hour, Mothers Against the Draft.
[00:09:02.583 --> 00:09:09.065]  And if you don't think a draft didn't come, folks, the draft's already here for people who are already in the military and already served their time.
[00:09:09.085 --> 00:09:13.126]  So three guests today, but I'm going to have each guest on about 15-20 minutes.
[00:09:14.467 --> 00:09:17.868]  That way, we'll have time to cover other news items and take your calls.
[00:09:17.928 --> 00:09:19.409]  Toll-free number to join us on-air, 1-800-255-99231.
[00:09:24.289 --> 00:09:42.311]  Well, it's being reported on how Bush was photographed kissing, kissing, that's right, kissing good old Joseph Lieberman, the guy who he ran against in that staged election in 2000.
[00:09:45.006 --> 00:09:49.448]  Now, obviously, he's not as close to Lieberman as he is to Kerry.
[00:09:49.528 --> 00:09:59.212]  I mean, these guys were hatched in the same coffin, the same little order of death incubator there at the Satanic Palace in New Haven, Connecticut.
[00:09:59.272 --> 00:10:06.816]  But this kissing, this kissing of his female nominees now is spreading to men, I guess.
[00:10:07.596 --> 00:10:13.739]  And here's the headline out of the Washington Post, a newly meaningful relationship.
[00:10:14.688 --> 00:10:18.491]  Romance is in the air today across the land on Valentine's.
[00:10:18.932 --> 00:10:21.874]  But in Washington, the buzz continues about the kiss.
[00:10:22.755 --> 00:10:25.417]  No, not Gustav Clement's famous painting.
[00:10:25.998 --> 00:10:41.091]  It's the big fat one, an exuberant bush planted on Senator Joseph Lieberman, right cheek as he waddled, I added that, waded through the Capitol crowd after the State of the Union a couple weeks ago.
[00:10:42.498 --> 00:10:53.008]  And then it goes into inside information the Washington Post has that it looks like Rumsfeld's going to be leaving in the next six months to a year.
[00:10:53.068 --> 00:10:57.332]  We heard that, of course, a few months ago when Bush was replacing other people in his cabinet.
[00:10:58.593 --> 00:11:00.936]  And then it looks like it'll be Lord Lieberman.
[00:11:02.077 --> 00:11:06.401]  Lord Lieberman, who, like Bush, is for gun control and open borders in UNESCO,
[00:11:07.941 --> 00:11:12.783]  He's also for the war, for attacking Syria, Iran, and everybody else.
[00:11:14.103 --> 00:11:16.844]  And Lieberman is just a real piece of work.
[00:11:16.924 --> 00:11:26.107]  And you'll have a nice Democrat up there as the war hawk over the Department of Defense.
[00:11:27.368 --> 00:11:28.228]  So very interesting.
[00:11:29.288 --> 00:11:30.569]  But it is an interesting question.
[00:11:30.589 --> 00:11:34.210]  You know, that's very European to be smacking people on the cheek.
[00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.191]  Downright Trotskyite, if you ask me.
[00:11:38.024 --> 00:11:40.305]  But kissing women on the lips?
[00:11:40.705 --> 00:11:51.131]  I haven't really talked about this much, but this weekend I was going back over some news articles and just kept noticing all the women he kisses on the lips on TV!
[00:11:52.512 --> 00:11:55.533]  And, you know, it's kind of unusual.
[00:11:57.414 --> 00:12:00.716]  In fact, it's very bizarre and I don't want to
[00:12:01.778 --> 00:12:07.924]  You know, today the big headline isn't that a new AIDS strain has popped up or HIV strain.
[00:12:07.964 --> 00:12:11.527]  It isn't that we're on the verge of war with Iran and others.
[00:12:11.607 --> 00:12:19.535]  It's that Chris Rock may not be the presenter or sergeant-at-arms
[00:12:20.339 --> 00:12:24.382]  Master of Ceremonies, you know, MC at the Academy Awards.
[00:12:24.422 --> 00:12:25.963]  Something I don't watch, folks.
[00:12:25.983 --> 00:12:27.764]  I don't watch much TV to begin with.
[00:12:28.445 --> 00:12:32.167]  Because he's been out bad-mouthing the Academy Awards while he's at it.
[00:12:33.588 --> 00:12:35.469]  That is top headline around the country.
[00:12:35.489 --> 00:12:38.171]  And, of course, below that is Michael Jackson.
[00:12:38.992 --> 00:12:42.874]  You've got to wade through all of this to get into any real news.
[00:12:43.395 --> 00:12:48.478]  Talking about Bush kissing everybody is kind of akin to that, but it's still interesting, is it not?
[00:12:50.911 --> 00:12:51.671]  It's pretty weird.
[00:12:51.691 --> 00:12:59.235]  Of course, the reports are that Bush and Rice are very good friends, very close friends.
[00:12:59.835 --> 00:13:10.319]  It's been in a lot of non-tabloid publications that they are, let's just say, they know each other very well, as some would put it.
[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:18.383]  But now the smacking and squeezing on men fits in with what the MO we've heard
[00:13:19.338 --> 00:13:26.362]  Well, the Bohemian Grove, they like to bus in the quote, top gay porn stars to quote, New York Post headline, service them.
[00:13:29.524 --> 00:13:31.145]  But I'm sure the kissing isn't that.
[00:13:32.146 --> 00:13:36.308]  I'm sure it's just friendliness by one of the Chief Democrats.
[00:13:37.089 --> 00:13:39.090]  And Lord Bush.
[00:13:40.291 --> 00:13:40.871]  Lord Bush.
[00:13:41.832 --> 00:13:45.474]  Now, continuing, speaking of defense secretaries,
[00:13:46.198 --> 00:13:47.299]  This is Der Spiegel.
[00:13:47.479 --> 00:13:50.801]  German prosecutor won't pursue Rumsfeld case.
[00:13:52.482 --> 00:14:03.090]  Germany's federal prosecutor says the allegations of the United States Defense Secretary of Defense Ronald Rumsfeld and other top Washington brass were responsible for Abu Ghraib must be investigated in the U.S.
[00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:05.011]  but not under German war crimes laws.
[00:14:05.411 --> 00:14:11.936]  The decision deals a blow to an American group that had brought the case, but it could ease German-American tensions.
[00:14:12.867 --> 00:14:26.690]  For more than two months, a legal petition to investigate the United States Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on war crimes charges connected to the Abu Ghraib torture scandal threatened to further strained relationships between Berlin and Washington.
[00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:30.550]  Where diplomats have been working overtime to patch up relations.
[00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:39.712]  Lately, the case made headlines again in recent weeks in the run-up to an annual security conference in Munich because Rumsfeld had threatened
[00:14:40.686 --> 00:14:44.828]  To sit out the meeting if the petition against him wasn't dropped.
[00:14:44.868 --> 00:14:45.088]  Yeah.
[00:14:45.488 --> 00:14:47.429]  Because he'd be arrested if he went to Germany.
[00:14:47.469 --> 00:14:49.010]  There was a potential of that.
[00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:50.131]  If he went to Deutschland.
[00:14:52.252 --> 00:14:53.833]  Shifting gears now.
[00:14:54.353 --> 00:14:56.934]  Talking about the Madrid fires.
[00:14:58.455 --> 00:14:59.756]  I could spend an hour on this.
[00:14:59.796 --> 00:15:00.976]  We just don't have time to do it.
[00:15:01.456 --> 00:15:03.518]  You're welcome to call in and talk about it later if you want.
[00:15:04.058 --> 00:15:07.139]  Massive blaze destroys Madrid.
[00:15:07.159 --> 00:15:08.320]  High rise.
[00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:10.201]  This out of the LA Times.
[00:15:11.181 --> 00:15:15.402]  Other headlines are similar.
[00:15:15.422 --> 00:15:20.364]  The biggest fire in Madrid history.
[00:15:20.404 --> 00:15:25.426]  Here's another headline out of El Pace, a big newspaper in Madrid.
[00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:32.848]  The worst fire in Madrid's history ravages 32-story skyscraper.
[00:15:34.409 --> 00:15:37.630]  And it burned for several days, starting up, of course, Saturday.
[00:15:38.587 --> 00:15:43.548]  Firefighters struggled for nearly 24 hours before controlling... They did nothing.
[00:15:43.928 --> 00:15:51.950]  ...one of Madrid's worst blazes, which reduced a 32-story office building to a blackened hulk of twisted wreckage.
[00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:53.711]  Very deceptive language there.
[00:15:54.231 --> 00:16:06.174]  Thick smoke and temperatures up to nearly 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit prevented firefighters from entering the Windsor Building until late Sunday.
[00:16:07.611 --> 00:16:12.934]  So it burned from Saturday evening through Sunday afternoon before they could even get up against it.
[00:16:13.354 --> 00:16:17.096]  The fire, which slightly injured seven people, erupted Saturday night.
[00:16:17.116 --> 00:16:20.398]  Though badly damaged, the tower didn't collapse.
[00:16:20.458 --> 00:16:21.119]  Let me read that again.
[00:16:21.579 --> 00:16:24.020]  Though badly damaged, the tower didn't collapse.
[00:16:24.161 --> 00:16:33.506]  And what they do is they focus up at the top of the tower and show a few sagging beams, the smaller beams that are in the roof.
[00:16:34.088 --> 00:16:35.249]  Not the big support beams.
[00:16:35.649 --> 00:16:37.971]  And go look at what the fire did to that metal.
[00:16:38.011 --> 00:16:38.992]  Yes, right up at the top.
[00:16:39.452 --> 00:16:40.773]  White, hot flames.
[00:16:40.813 --> 00:16:42.094]  I mean, it was a hot fire.
[00:16:43.015 --> 00:16:46.197]  Got a good fluke going from down in the mid-sections right up to the top.
[00:16:46.557 --> 00:16:49.139]  Blasting out, I mean, 50 and 100 foot flames.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.641]  Shooting out.
[00:16:50.981 --> 00:16:51.982]  White flames.
[00:16:52.562 --> 00:16:53.983]  Shooting out.
[00:16:55.744 --> 00:16:57.406]  For over 24 hours.
[00:16:57.526 --> 00:16:59.527]  Before the firefighters could even get near it.
[00:17:00.568 --> 00:17:01.749]  Blasting out.
[00:17:02.526 --> 00:17:05.829]  And then burning itself out and they spray some water on it and go, look, we saved it.
[00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:27.366]  Now you look at the building, seven fires, small red fires, black smoke at about eight floors, burned for about seven hours, magically, suddenly a main support beam with the classical controlled demolition paradigm signature implodes, the whole thing falls in on itself in a nice little neat pile.
[00:17:28.396 --> 00:17:32.677]  And we have video of blast going off from the bottom up right before it falls.
[00:17:33.557 --> 00:17:34.758]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:17:36.258 --> 00:17:40.059]  Then of course you have the other two towers with people standing in the holes.
[00:17:40.659 --> 00:17:42.340]  Standing in, waving for help.
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.780]  People standing there for 20 minutes, waving.
[00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:47.041]  In the supposed hottest parts of the building.
[00:17:48.386 --> 00:17:56.131]  And, uh, again, even if it was burning hot earlier, which it wasn't, when the planes first hit and the jet fuel burned itself out, steel then cools.
[00:17:56.591 --> 00:18:08.018]  So then the buildings cool, the firefighters are reporting that the fires are almost out, and, uh, they've knocked them down to just two small fires in the North Tower, then suddenly it collapses.
[00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:11.320]  The hottest area!
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.641]  People standing there!
[00:18:12.801 --> 00:18:14.462]  Standing in the windows!
[00:18:15.122 --> 00:18:16.003]  Standing in the hole!
[00:18:17.518 --> 00:18:20.240]  And it just magically collapses.
[00:18:21.842 --> 00:18:22.522]  Okay, fine.
[00:18:22.542 --> 00:18:23.163]  We'll buy that.
[00:18:23.783 --> 00:18:25.424]  But it didn't happen.
[00:18:25.504 --> 00:18:26.165]  It's a fraud.
[00:18:26.185 --> 00:18:26.845]  There were bombs.
[00:18:26.906 --> 00:18:28.647]  But let's just give that to them.
[00:18:28.987 --> 00:18:29.948]  No plane hit Building 7.
[00:18:30.348 --> 00:18:31.449]  It's in another area.
[00:18:31.489 --> 00:18:32.430]  A whole other block.
[00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:37.494]  Buildings right up against the towers who were hit by the falling buildings.
[00:18:37.694 --> 00:18:38.735]  Didn't burn down.
[00:18:39.135 --> 00:18:39.936]  Didn't collapse.
[00:18:40.516 --> 00:18:42.558]  But magically this one does.
[00:18:43.627 --> 00:18:48.688]  If your building was owned by Silverstein, it was marked for total destruction.
[00:18:50.648 --> 00:18:52.088]  But here it is yet again.
[00:18:52.128 --> 00:18:53.909]  We had Caracas late last year.
[00:18:54.049 --> 00:18:54.949]  Huge building.
[00:18:56.049 --> 00:18:57.089]  Sixty-something stories.
[00:18:57.649 --> 00:19:00.650]  Fire shooting out for, what, 10-11 hours?
[00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:06.751]  Huge white flames, 20-30 feet long, just blasting out.
[00:19:06.871 --> 00:19:07.551]  White flames.
[00:19:07.951 --> 00:19:08.611]  White flames.
[00:19:08.651 --> 00:19:09.511]  That means it's hot.
[00:19:11.552 --> 00:19:11.972]  It goes
[00:19:13.157 --> 00:19:17.779]  Red, orange, yellow, white, and then blue.
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.520]  The next to hottest is white.
[00:19:21.801 --> 00:19:26.963]  I've got some video of the tower, the one over the weekend, and I said white.
[00:19:26.983 --> 00:19:29.885]  I mean, there were even some blue tips on them.
[00:19:29.905 --> 00:19:36.047]  So we've got white-blue flame shooting out 50 to 100 feet over the weekend on this baby.
[00:19:36.087 --> 00:19:37.048]  Again, in Caracas, 20 to 30 feet.
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.801]  And, uh, didn't collapse!
[00:19:40.281 --> 00:19:43.902]  But, man, I noticed, right after caught on fire, collapse, collapse, collapse.
[00:19:44.162 --> 00:19:47.483]  Why it should collapse, why buildings collapse now, that's just the new science!
[00:19:48.643 --> 00:19:49.924]  But it didn't collapse, did it?
[00:19:51.404 --> 00:19:55.205]  And it wasn't even as sturdily built as the towers, or Building 7.
[00:19:55.365 --> 00:20:00.287]  Alright, I got just a bunch of other news about this new AIDS variety.
[00:20:00.307 --> 00:20:01.487]  Let me get back.
[00:20:03.678 --> 00:20:07.582]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:20:07.802 --> 00:20:20.093]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:20:20.513 --> 00:20:20.913]  The U.S.
[00:20:20.953 --> 00:20:26.538]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:20:26.939 --> 00:20:29.141]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:20:31.002 --> 00:20:32.063]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:20:32.103 --> 00:20:34.944]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:20:35.064 --> 00:20:41.087]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:20:41.508 --> 00:20:44.869]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[00:20:44.949 --> 00:20:51.293]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.

[00:21:03.118 --> 00:21:07.340]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the words you use.
[00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:16.343]  In business and socially, your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.

[00:22:03.194 --> 00:22:04.815]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:22:04.955 --> 00:22:08.976]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:22:09.196 --> 00:22:12.077]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:22:12.157 --> 00:22:18.879]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:22:19.059 --> 00:22:22.060]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:24.661]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:22:24.781 --> 00:22:32.684]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[00:22:32.984 --> 00:22:44.272]  Markazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrate, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are extracted.

[00:23:03.331 --> 00:23:09.836]  Hi, this is Tasha Sharp with the Genesis Radio Network, and I'm here to introduce to you a product that will put the pet back in your step.
[00:23:10.016 --> 00:23:14.659]  If you're like me, a working mom and even working dad, then these issues will sound familiar to you all.
[00:23:14.859 --> 00:23:26.988]  Lack of energy, lack of strength, lack of stamina, lack of sleep, making time for housework, cooking, homework, shopping and chauffeuring, making time with the kids, making time with the husband, making time for intimacy, most importantly, making time for yourself.
[00:23:27.248 --> 00:23:31.111]  I'm here to tell you that there is a way that you can make time for all of these things and more.
[00:23:31.351 --> 00:23:33.653]  Introducing the incredible Life Wave Patch.
[00:23:33.873 --> 00:23:37.876]  It is safe, non-invasive, and is currently being used by world-renowned athletes.
[00:23:38.116 --> 00:23:41.058]  Olympics, professional, collegiate, high school, and little leagues alike.
[00:23:41.339 --> 00:23:44.221]  Everyday businessmen and women in all walks of industry.
[00:23:44.421 --> 00:23:46.883]  Anyone looking for that extra edge over their competition?
[00:23:47.143 --> 00:23:48.364]  Or just trying to beat the clock?
[00:23:48.604 --> 00:23:50.666]  This is truly the answer you've been looking for.

[00:24:04.368 --> 00:24:09.532]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:10.192 --> 00:24:12.554]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:13.895 --> 00:24:20.240]  The un-American, anti-gun, anti-border, anti-family, pro-abortion neocons
[00:24:22.395 --> 00:24:27.339]  I've been saying, seize anybody that reports on our military activities and execute them.
[00:24:27.379 --> 00:24:35.224]  Tony Blakely, one of the editors of the Washington Times, called for Seymour Hersh to be seized and executed by the government a few weeks ago.
[00:24:35.244 --> 00:24:38.287]  And many others, of course, called for it as well.
[00:24:39.067 --> 00:24:46.633]  Well, that's interesting then, because the Voice of America and ABC News first broke it about U.S.
[00:24:46.713 --> 00:24:51.276]  spy planes, spy drones, flying all over Iran right now.
[00:24:53.163 --> 00:24:57.832]  And so I guess, uh, is Tony Blightly gonna call for the people at ABC News?
[00:24:58.954 --> 00:25:01.780]  And this has all been put out by the Defense Department as provocation.
[00:25:03.035 --> 00:25:07.759]  I mean, look, CNN, ABC, at the top, folks, they're steered by the Defense Department.
[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:20.451]  In fact, that came out, what, four years ago in World Daily and the Washington Post, of all places, that CNN had hundreds of members of Army Psychological Warfare Division in there overseeing everything.
[00:25:20.831 --> 00:25:23.814]  Again, they play the fake left and Fox plays the fake right.
[00:25:23.834 --> 00:25:27.477]  And they don't have to have everybody that works for them being an agent.
[00:25:27.517 --> 00:25:29.479]  They just hire people that have their same mindset.
[00:25:30.109 --> 00:25:31.370]  Got a few agents at the top.
[00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:43.096]  I'm sure you now know about how they pay off a lot of people, reporters, and you know how there's people in the White House at press briefings who have fake names and really work for the White House.
[00:25:43.556 --> 00:25:50.219]  By the time it gets spun on Fox News, I even watched them this weekend, it's, well this guy's bad, this is bad security, he had a fake name.
[00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:54.021]  Well, yeah, because the White House told him to do it.
[00:25:54.041 --> 00:25:57.143]  I mean, it's just, and that's admitted, it's just amazing spin.
[00:25:58.621 --> 00:26:03.924]  Well, the latest thing is CNN nuke plant photos identical for both Iran and North Korea.
[00:26:04.264 --> 00:26:05.825]  They have the CNN article right here.
[00:26:05.845 --> 00:26:10.827]  It's an aerial photo of North Korea's Pyongyang nuclear plant outside of Pyongyang.
[00:26:11.668 --> 00:26:19.292]  And then in another article from a week ago, it says here is an aerial photo of Iran's nuclear facility.
[00:26:20.052 --> 00:26:21.693]  And it's the same photo.
[00:26:22.474 --> 00:26:23.954]  It's the kind of stuff they do, folks.
[00:26:24.755 --> 00:26:26.956]  Back during the war, or right before the war, look!
[00:26:27.668 --> 00:26:32.593]  We found their bio-weapons lab, of course, in Kurdish-controlled Iraq, which was one thing.
[00:26:32.653 --> 00:26:36.977]  I'm like, wait a minute, Saddam doesn't even control that area of the country, even if this is true.
[00:26:36.997 --> 00:26:41.742]  And then it turned out the BBC sent reporters there to it, and it was a bakery.
[00:26:43.183 --> 00:26:44.624]  A bakery.
[00:26:45.325 --> 00:26:48.088]  But oh, look, it's a smokestack, a little stack on a building.
[00:26:48.188 --> 00:26:51.051]  It's a bio-weapons lab!
[00:26:52.583 --> 00:26:54.564]  It's gotta be fifty times if it wasn't a hundred.
[00:26:54.584 --> 00:26:55.425]  It was over fifty.
[00:26:55.905 --> 00:26:59.008]  Every week after the invasion, we found sarin shells!
[00:26:59.028 --> 00:27:03.251]  And they'd show them on the news, and it'd turn out all those weren't sarin shells, but that'd be in the back of the paper.
[00:27:03.271 --> 00:27:08.094]  And I still have arguments with people who believe they found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, folks.
[00:27:08.114 --> 00:27:13.698]  Of course, they can't find Iraq on a map, but they can tell me how gun control's conservative.
[00:27:13.738 --> 00:27:16.520]  I mean, they are that stupid, or that dumbed down.
[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:20.363]  I mean, I shouldn't call them stupid, because they know all the football and baseball scores.
[00:27:22.757 --> 00:27:28.779]  And they know how to, I guess, go to cocktail parties and regurgitate what they heard on the McLaughlin Group.
[00:27:28.819 --> 00:27:35.881]  And literally, folks who think they're intellectual will, like, repeat what they heard some other regurgitators say.
[00:27:35.901 --> 00:27:51.145]  And that's the same thing with the globalists vomited out from the think tanks, and then the top pundits vomit that out, and then local top pundits vomit that out, and then local ne'er-do-wells who follow that, kind of the camp followers, they regurgitate it.
[00:27:51.843 --> 00:27:53.684]  There's a process of regurgitation.
[00:27:54.364 --> 00:27:56.825]  Only way to describe it, folks, down the line.
[00:27:58.285 --> 00:28:02.747]  But you can read this story at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:28:02.767 --> 00:28:04.267]  You can read all about it.
[00:28:04.367 --> 00:28:07.668]  CNN's nuke plant photos identical for both Iran and North Korea.
[00:28:08.088 --> 00:28:09.149]  Ah, but so what?
[00:28:09.169 --> 00:28:10.649]  I mean, being lied to is good.
[00:28:10.689 --> 00:28:11.470]  You know, it's freedom.
[00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:13.390]  As long as I feel like I'm part of the system.
[00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:15.631]  As long as I feel like I'm powerful.
[00:28:16.278 --> 00:28:24.780]  A published report says the United States has been flying drones over Iran for almost a year, looking for evidence of nuclear weapons programs and detected weaknesses in the air defenses.
[00:28:25.541 --> 00:28:27.301]  There's no reason to fly drones over.
[00:28:27.361 --> 00:28:28.881]  They've given up their sovereignty.
[00:28:30.342 --> 00:28:32.763]  They've had thousands of UN inspectors in there for what?
[00:28:34.023 --> 00:28:34.743]  Five years?
[00:28:36.303 --> 00:28:40.285]  The inspectors that we've interviewed on this program have said no one is more open.
[00:28:40.325 --> 00:28:41.565]  I mean, they let you go anywhere.
[00:28:42.525 --> 00:28:44.006]  I want to go into that facility.
[00:28:44.066 --> 00:28:45.046]  I want to check everything.
[00:28:45.146 --> 00:28:45.486]  I want to
[00:28:46.238 --> 00:28:48.580]  It's not like you hide this stuff under a rosebush, either.
[00:28:49.641 --> 00:28:51.522]  Even though they tried to tell us that earlier.
[00:28:51.883 --> 00:28:53.004]  They never did that in Iraq.
[00:28:53.244 --> 00:28:53.444]  Look!
[00:28:53.504 --> 00:28:54.705]  A nuclear weapons plant!
[00:28:55.005 --> 00:28:56.546]  Buried under a rosebush!
[00:28:57.407 --> 00:28:59.429]  So it's pretty sick, folks.
[00:28:59.989 --> 00:29:01.490]  But that's what we're facing there.
[00:29:02.571 --> 00:29:09.137]  Really scary new super strain of resistant AIDS virus, or HIV virus.
[00:29:10.418 --> 00:29:13.080]  The virus that they tell us causes AIDS.
[00:29:13.837 --> 00:29:16.319]  Which is a very race-specific thing, by the way.
[00:29:16.719 --> 00:29:19.981]  Two new patients may hold clues to potent HIV.
[00:29:20.241 --> 00:29:21.962]  And they do have cures, by the way.
[00:29:24.564 --> 00:29:31.909]  When people start shooting their mouths off like Magic Johnson about how there's a cure, suddenly they give him the cure and then he shuts up.
[00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:34.731]  Same thing with Tommy Morrison and others.
[00:29:36.993 --> 00:29:40.295]  But that's just some of what's coming up, folks.
[00:29:41.997 --> 00:29:44.279]  So we'll talk about this new age virus later.
[00:29:45.279 --> 00:29:47.861]  We got some parents coming on who are fighting Big Brother.
[00:29:47.881 --> 00:29:49.222]  You don't want to miss it.
[00:29:49.242 --> 00:29:52.364]  Stay with us.
[00:29:53.785 --> 00:29:54.706]  We're on the march.
[00:29:55.166 --> 00:29:56.787]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:57.688 --> 00:30:00.410]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:06.814]  It's like magic.
[00:30:09.472 --> 00:30:14.676]  One of America's greatest patriots, Patrick Henry, said, give me liberty or give me death.
[00:30:15.637 --> 00:30:19.720]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution.
[00:30:20.161 --> 00:30:28.868]  Your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.
[00:30:29.648 --> 00:30:34.953]  There are certain movements underway to strip you of these unalienable, unchangeable rights today.
[00:30:35.811 --> 00:30:43.120]  To help you grasp the loss of these freedoms, we'll send you absolutely free a one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:30:43.881 --> 00:30:44.422]  Just call 1-800-516-8736.
[00:30:44.442 --> 00:30:44.742]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:30:56.224 --> 00:30:57.485]  It's absolutely free.
[00:30:57.946 --> 00:31:00.248]  Operators are standing by to assist you.
[00:31:00.888 --> 00:31:02.550]  Just call right now.
[00:31:03.111 --> 00:31:10.617]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:31:10.898 --> 00:31:21.808]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:31:22.068 --> 00:31:23.871]  Yet require very little energy.
[00:31:24.151 --> 00:31:27.455]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:31:27.816 --> 00:31:38.250]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:39.051]  That's right.
[00:31:39.231 --> 00:31:46.358]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:31:46.638 --> 00:31:50.762]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[00:31:50.922 --> 00:31:55.387]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:55.447 --> 00:31:55.887]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:32:04.355 --> 00:32:10.660]  Hey, psst, JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:11.981]  You use deodorant, right?
[00:32:12.321 --> 00:32:13.162]  I mean, who doesn't?
[00:32:13.422 --> 00:32:18.146]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[00:32:18.346 --> 00:32:19.387]  Check out this new product.
[00:32:19.607 --> 00:32:26.132]  It's called No-B-O, and it will destroy the odor-causing bacteria so effectively, you may never have to wear deodorant again.
[00:32:26.492 --> 00:32:29.855]  I know, you're wondering, how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor?
[00:32:29.855 --> 00:32:30.115]  I think so.
[00:32:46.124 --> 00:32:47.365]  We're good to go.
[00:33:14.324 --> 00:33:17.586]  Alright, 33 minutes, 12 seconds into this first hour.
[00:33:17.927 --> 00:33:24.191]  We're going to be talking to the father of a elementary school student.
[00:33:24.211 --> 00:33:27.414]  They're having to wear RFID tags in Sutter, California.
[00:33:28.394 --> 00:33:32.697]  And a big national fight is brewing over this, because this is going in all over the country.
[00:33:32.717 --> 00:33:37.601]  We'll be talking about how your children are being trained to be little slaves, and I even have the federal documents.
[00:33:38.385 --> 00:33:47.050]  Coming up here in just a minute or two in the valiant fight of real American patriots like Jeffrey Tatro.
[00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:51.172]  But before we do that, please listen carefully, folks.
[00:33:52.473 --> 00:33:53.994]  Attention, attention, attention.
[00:33:54.074 --> 00:33:57.055]  We need to wake people up about the growing police state.
[00:33:57.796 --> 00:34:07.761]  That's why I have made three professionally produced documentary films, Police State 2000, Police State 2 The Takeover, and Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:10.572]  They are absolute must-sees.
[00:34:11.132 --> 00:34:19.859]  From urban warfare training drills in South Texas, police chiefs talking about how the military tried to bribe them, the FEMA camps, all of it.
[00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:21.881]  That's in my first film.
[00:34:21.981 --> 00:34:23.102]  It's an unbelievable video.
[00:34:23.142 --> 00:34:24.083]  Everybody's got to have it.
[00:34:24.423 --> 00:34:29.587]  Police state to the takeover shows how the feds hire provocateurs in places like Seattle and D.C.
[00:34:29.607 --> 00:34:33.811]  to cause riots, but then go after the peaceful protesters and put them in a FEMA camp.
[00:34:34.423 --> 00:34:36.425]  That's government drug dealing, you name it.
[00:34:36.445 --> 00:34:38.247]  There's just too much in the film to describe.
[00:34:39.268 --> 00:34:43.652]  Police State, three total enslavement is probably my most scholarly work.
[00:34:43.772 --> 00:34:45.413]  Two hours, forty-four minutes long.
[00:34:45.874 --> 00:34:49.677]  Who the neocons are, what the New World Order is, the false left-right paradigm.
[00:34:49.777 --> 00:34:51.339]  I just, you gotta see it.
[00:34:53.053 --> 00:34:59.579]  They're $25.95 apiece, $20 or $19.95 apiece if you order three or more of any of the 11 films I've made.
[00:34:59.599 --> 00:35:04.403]  That's an $18 discount with a three-tape special, a $24 discount with a four-tape special.
[00:35:04.944 --> 00:35:14.692]  Of course, I'm offering a special on my 9-11 film, my preeminent 9-11 film, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, almost three hours long, the history of state-sponsored terrorism.
[00:35:15.073 --> 00:35:19.376]  Then it goes right through from Nero through Hitler to the Northwoods document to
[00:35:20.597 --> 00:35:22.739]  The first World Trade Center bombing to Oklahoma City.
[00:35:23.079 --> 00:35:25.181]  The 9-11 to the unfolding police state.
[00:35:25.921 --> 00:35:29.043]  One copy for $24.95, each additional for $5.95.
[00:35:29.384 --> 00:35:33.927]  You can get four or five copies and give them as gifts and support this broadcast in the process.
[00:35:34.787 --> 00:35:41.372]  My newest film, American Dictators, documenting the staged election of 04, gets into how Kerry was going to throw the election.
[00:35:41.412 --> 00:35:44.314]  We can talk about that in the film before it even was an election.
[00:35:45.169 --> 00:35:49.713]  Go to the website infowars.com to order the films via the safe, secure online shopping cart to watch
[00:36:15.276 --> 00:36:18.502]  In some cases, upwards of half the films for free, right there where you ordered them.
[00:36:18.522 --> 00:36:20.485]  Here, watch half of them for free, see if you want it!
[00:36:22.478 --> 00:36:26.800]  Just, it's all there at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll-free.
[00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:29.942]  You can ask about the specials when you call if you're not sure what you want to order.
[00:36:29.962 --> 00:36:31.783]  1-888-253-3139, 888-253-3139 or just write to me.
[00:36:31.803 --> 00:36:34.504]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[00:36:48.126 --> 00:36:58.089]  We've got a bunch of other great books and videos and books on tape that we carry by other great researchers and authors at Infowars.com or by calling AAA-253-3139.
[00:36:58.509 --> 00:37:03.931]  And of course, you can watch them all online, 15 cents a day at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:37:04.051 --> 00:37:04.831]  Just go check it out.
[00:37:05.691 --> 00:37:06.971]  Now, I appreciate him holding.
[00:37:07.011 --> 00:37:15.394]  We're joined by Jeffrey Tatro from Sutter, California, a little bit north of Arnold's Base Camp, Sacramento.
[00:37:16.491 --> 00:37:22.654]  Basically, how it all started was the superintendent-slash-principal of Britton Elementary School in
[00:37:46.744 --> 00:38:05.456]  conjunction with a local-based corporation established the issuance of student body ID cards that were now required to be worn around the neck of each and every student in addition to RFID technology chips that were attached to the back of these ID card holders.
[00:38:06.077 --> 00:38:07.818]  All of this worn around the student's necks.
[00:38:08.621 --> 00:38:10.063]  That's how it basically got started.
[00:38:11.325 --> 00:38:20.877]  It was initially implemented on a limited basis this past summer during the summer school session, which out of a school of almost 600
[00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:25.552]  There was a very small handful of these students actively participating.
[00:38:26.052 --> 00:38:33.837]  They weren't allowed to take the chips or the badges home, so therefore a lot of parents didn't know what was going on until about the middle of January.
[00:38:34.257 --> 00:38:48.246]  All of a sudden, the 7th and 8th grade students were coming home with these badges being told, you must wear these, these are not an option, and if anything happens to them or you fail to comply, there's going to be punishment levied against you.
[00:38:49.246 --> 00:39:02.094]  That got an awful lot of parents upset from the standpoint of now we're being told we have to do something when we had no input as well as we did not know what this technology was on the back of these badges.
[00:39:02.714 --> 00:39:05.716]  Let me just stop you there and throw folks in for a second.
[00:39:05.996 --> 00:39:09.238]  In almost every school district in the nation they target the children
[00:39:11.332 --> 00:39:14.236]  And again, this is a conglomerate of the elementary with the middle school.
[00:39:14.296 --> 00:39:16.679]  It's called an elementary school, Britain Elementary School.
[00:39:17.079 --> 00:39:21.605]  But to fill people in, all over the country, from about age 10
[00:39:23.339 --> 00:39:24.540]  9 to 12.
[00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:26.561]  This is where they introduce everything.
[00:39:26.721 --> 00:39:28.041]  Thousands of school districts.
[00:39:28.582 --> 00:39:31.103]  You have to thumb scan to get school lunches.
[00:39:31.723 --> 00:39:32.984]  No cash allowed.
[00:39:33.064 --> 00:39:35.065]  Training them with the Casual Society Control Grid.
[00:39:35.385 --> 00:39:36.685]  We have the federal plans.
[00:39:36.725 --> 00:39:40.787]  We've covered it here, where they say we're going to train the kids to accept this technology.
[00:39:41.107 --> 00:39:44.289]  Then in the future, as a generation, all Americans will have to do this.
[00:39:45.089 --> 00:39:46.570]  We've had the federal experts on.
[00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:47.570]  We've read the documents.
[00:39:48.091 --> 00:39:50.772]  They also, coast to coast, almost every elementary school,
[00:39:51.778 --> 00:39:52.979]  Make the children.
[00:39:52.999 --> 00:39:58.504]  Now understand, by the seventh grade, write essays on their parents.
[00:39:58.565 --> 00:40:02.348]  It's called a journal that's put into a computer, quote, so they can check for plagiarism.
[00:40:02.588 --> 00:40:04.991]  But really, that's cross-indexed, put into federal databanks.
[00:40:05.051 --> 00:40:05.991]  I have mainstream news.
[00:40:07.273 --> 00:40:09.395]  I just want to fill folks in on the full magnitude of this.
[00:40:10.195 --> 00:40:12.618]  Thousands of school districts have a BATF
[00:40:13.234 --> 00:40:14.535]  This is total totalitarianism.
[00:40:34.831 --> 00:40:47.578]  And now with the RFIDs, Walmart and the Defense Department two years ago told all manufacturers in the world that supply them, you must have RFID by 05 or we're not going to buy your products.
[00:40:47.598 --> 00:40:50.300]  Now that's behind schedule, we're protesting it, we're fighting it.
[00:40:50.928 --> 00:40:57.796]  We have the federal documents, the industry documents from the Major Chicago RFID Expo last year where they show the map.
[00:40:58.296 --> 00:41:07.787]  That is a PowerPoint presentation from the manufacturer, to the warehouse, to the store, to your home, to the trash trucks that will scan your trash can when they pull up.
[00:41:08.507 --> 00:41:09.488]  Well, I'm glad to hear
[00:41:33.639 --> 00:41:42.941]  That viewpoint coming from somebody else who is not directly affiliated with this elementary school or our community, that is one of our main concerns.
[00:41:43.461 --> 00:41:45.182]  Aside from the fact... Well, I have the documents.
[00:41:45.422 --> 00:41:47.442]  Just so you know, if you want these, I'll send them to you.
[00:41:47.482 --> 00:41:49.203]  This is all mainstream.
[00:41:49.443 --> 00:41:51.323]  That might be very beneficial to us.
[00:41:52.023 --> 00:41:58.065]  That is one of the messages that we are trying to get out to some of the parents here locally as well as the administration, is that
[00:41:58.934 --> 00:42:00.478]  This is just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:42:01.079 --> 00:42:07.494]  If society allows our children to be tagged and tracked in this manner...
[00:42:08.174 --> 00:42:09.775]  Then it's going to grow.
[00:42:10.155 --> 00:42:13.437]  Look at what's happened to cell phones in the last 20 years.
[00:42:13.597 --> 00:42:19.121]  They've gone from the size of a suitcase down to something so small that you can put it in your pocket.
[00:42:19.201 --> 00:42:28.446]  Well, by law, all cell phones starting October 1st, 2001 have a tracker chip in them that satellite triangulated off the cell towers down to 15 feet.
[00:42:29.107 --> 00:42:29.627]  Exactly.
[00:42:30.067 --> 00:42:34.410]  But our contention with that is, in order for
[00:42:35.601 --> 00:42:43.367]  Somebody, something, to locate that phone legitimately, they have to have a court order to access your phone records.
[00:42:44.788 --> 00:42:53.656]  But as this technology progresses, it's going to become easier and easier to get their hands on these RFID... Well, no, you're right.
[00:42:53.736 --> 00:42:55.557]  And see, they argue, well, stuff's already so bad.
[00:42:55.597 --> 00:42:57.639]  We already know your identity, so why don't you just put up with it?
[00:42:57.659 --> 00:43:02.242]  That's like saying, if I've got a broken arm and I go to the doctor, he goes, let's not fix your arm.
[00:43:02.282 --> 00:43:03.844]  In fact, let's just break the other one.
[00:43:07.486 --> 00:43:08.687]  That's one way of looking at it.
[00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:17.737]  This technology does have a benefit and we are not total technophobes here.
[00:43:18.818 --> 00:43:21.261]  But it's how this is being implemented system-wide, sir.
[00:43:21.881 --> 00:43:23.403]  RFID by its very nature
[00:43:24.187 --> 00:43:28.391]  By the way, they're laying down the infrastructure is to shift off the barcode.
[00:43:28.571 --> 00:43:30.573]  Everything will have an RFID.
[00:43:30.954 --> 00:43:31.454]  Exactly.
[00:43:31.715 --> 00:43:36.660]  In fact, they just passed the National ID card out of the House last week with an RFID chip in it.
[00:43:37.761 --> 00:43:37.941]  Right.
[00:43:38.201 --> 00:43:40.603]  Yeah, that's some of the information that's starting to come our way.
[00:43:42.589 --> 00:43:49.551]  As our concerns go out and we get the message out, more and more people are contacting us with bits and pieces of information.
[00:43:49.571 --> 00:43:51.471]  I'm looking at the Associated Press here in front of me.
[00:43:51.852 --> 00:43:52.092]  Okay.
[00:43:52.572 --> 00:43:52.932]  Alright.
[00:43:52.952 --> 00:43:55.232]  I'm not trying to jump in and show off how much I know.
[00:43:55.313 --> 00:44:00.314]  I want you, who are instinctively aware of this, who I want to commend.
[00:44:00.694 --> 00:44:02.014]  Now, there's a case you ought to look at.
[00:44:02.034 --> 00:44:11.537]  There was a case with a barcode in Louisiana about five years ago, and one student refused, they kicked him out, then dozens refused, then half of them refused, and they had to remove it.
[00:44:11.857 --> 00:44:18.059]  And so, other schools have had to remove this stuff, and they know that if they can force you to do it, this is going to spread.
[00:44:18.079 --> 00:44:18.439]  Go ahead.
[00:44:18.819 --> 00:44:19.299]  Exactly.
[00:44:19.819 --> 00:44:30.842]  And that's the crux of our message, is that we feel that no child should have to wear or be subjected to... Well, they're doing this in rural areas, or in Japan, where there's no crown to speak of.
[00:44:30.862 --> 00:44:31.823]  They're doing it in Missouri.
[00:44:32.043 --> 00:44:36.984]  They're just announcing, here's your RFID tag, wear it around your neck, slave.
[00:44:38.439 --> 00:44:39.419]  And what are we to do?
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.840]  Are we to just roll over and accept it?
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:53.524]  And if we're willing to accept that, I don't want to sound as though this is where it's going, but it has the potential that if we accept it now, 15-20 years from now,
[00:44:55.322 --> 00:45:03.627]  Infants, as soon as they're born in a hospital or before they're discharged from a hospital, we're going to be implanting this technology into them.
[00:45:03.807 --> 00:45:04.468]  You didn't know?
[00:45:04.808 --> 00:45:10.832]  You didn't know that by 1998 they would put a temporary chip in the umbilical cord stub?
[00:45:11.332 --> 00:45:13.554]  This was in Time Magazine.
[00:45:14.014 --> 00:45:16.255]  It was in the Future of Money issue back in the late 90s.
[00:45:16.756 --> 00:45:18.637]  They were already putting a chip in the umbilical cord.
[00:45:19.506 --> 00:45:21.547]  No, that information hasn't come our way.
[00:45:23.268 --> 00:45:24.109]  Let me tell you more.
[00:45:24.329 --> 00:45:35.995]  There was an article out of the Indianapolis paper last week saying there's discussions of making anyone that goes to the hospital take a chip under the skin, quote, temporarily.
[00:45:37.496 --> 00:45:41.819]  Now, taking something under the skin is one thing.
[00:45:43.198 --> 00:45:46.881]  We know that hospitals occasionally, from time to time, lose patients.
[00:45:47.001 --> 00:45:48.062]  They get misplaced.
[00:45:48.122 --> 00:45:49.563]  That's their excuse, yeah.
[00:45:49.823 --> 00:45:51.304]  But, okay, fine.
[00:45:51.424 --> 00:45:52.805]  Put a band.
[00:45:52.965 --> 00:45:56.848]  You know, when you go into a hospital, you get a band put around your wrist that identifies you.
[00:45:56.868 --> 00:45:58.390]  We really need to put this in you, sir.
[00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:01.612]  No, it does not need to be implanted in us.
[00:46:02.973 --> 00:46:04.194]  Now, see, you're not normal.
[00:46:04.294 --> 00:46:05.935]  Once you have it, you're going to feel much better.
[00:46:06.796 --> 00:46:07.977]  Why don't you just join us?
[00:46:11.109 --> 00:46:22.761]  There is one thing that we have brought up in a limited capacity, because sometimes it gets misrepresented or misused, but that is, look towards the back of the Bible.
[00:46:23.757 --> 00:46:25.619]  There's a section in Revelation.
[00:46:26.019 --> 00:46:29.301]  Well, our initial response was to go and talk to the administration and voice our concerns.
[00:46:29.341 --> 00:46:30.062]  We saw that that was
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:42.881]  Not productive.
[00:46:43.442 --> 00:46:52.573]  So therefore, we as parents issued a letter of complaint against the board and the administration who authorized this test to take place.
[00:46:52.794 --> 00:46:56.158]  And this tracks your kids wherever they go around the school and makes a record.
[00:46:56.198 --> 00:46:57.580]  So what happened next?
[00:46:57.860 --> 00:47:00.824]  Well, the complaint letter was met with
[00:47:01.568 --> 00:47:14.497]  A letter from the school's attorney instructing us basically that if our child did not participate in this test that they would be disciplined and we opted to see just what would happen.
[00:47:14.597 --> 00:47:16.559]  So we told our daughter and we told the school
[00:47:17.239 --> 00:47:17.979]  She's not wearing it.
[00:47:18.339 --> 00:47:19.500]  She's not taking it to school.
[00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:21.380]  There's just no two ways about it.
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:24.581]  She's not wearing the collar around her neck or the ring on her nose?
[00:47:25.061 --> 00:47:27.462]  No, she's not wearing anything that can track her.
[00:47:27.902 --> 00:47:33.784]  We have told her as parents that the school student body card is to be kept in your purse.
[00:47:34.834 --> 00:47:46.124]  And if for any reason a staff member or administrative member at the school does not recognize you and they ask for identification to make sure you... But see how they're kind of winning the war like that, though?
[00:47:46.204 --> 00:47:53.249]  You know, so then you still... I mean, most schools already have these cards they can still read into the purse, but... Okay, so you're trying to even be, quote, reasonable with them.
[00:47:53.449 --> 00:47:53.930]  What happened?
[00:47:55.675 --> 00:47:59.199]  Basically, the school started to back off a little bit.
[00:47:59.279 --> 00:48:07.228]  So far, our children who have been told not to wear the tags have not suffered any disciplinary action.
[00:48:07.708 --> 00:48:11.793]  There was a board meeting last week, Tuesday night.
[00:48:12.353 --> 00:48:19.439]  And at that board meeting, it came out that no child would be disciplined if they fail to wear the tag.
[00:48:19.479 --> 00:48:20.940]  But think what America's come to.
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:24.303]  I mean, we're actually now, it's the kids that have the tags and the kids that don't.
[00:48:25.084 --> 00:48:26.925]  And, sir, you need to get rid of those tags.
[00:48:27.566 --> 00:48:27.946]  Period.
[00:48:27.986 --> 00:48:36.313]  I mean, if they want to have, which is bad enough, some little, you know, ID card that they make where they take a little picture of you and they put it in a little
[00:48:37.185 --> 00:48:38.565]  Exactly, and that's what we are working towards.
[00:48:54.910 --> 00:49:01.698]  So far the school has not come out and said, alright, the board has not made a final decision.
[00:49:01.718 --> 00:49:04.521]  Now you said a corporation was involved in this, who's that?
[00:49:05.242 --> 00:49:11.389]  It's a local startup corporation that from what we've been able to find out was started a year ago, March.
[00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:29.421]  A local businessman who is versed in marketing and sales and promoting was connected with two staff members at our local high school even though this is a small town.
[00:49:29.682 --> 00:49:31.042]  Who's RFID is this?
[00:49:32.784 --> 00:49:33.944]  Who manufactures it?
[00:49:33.985 --> 00:49:34.305]  Yes.
[00:49:34.825 --> 00:49:36.026]  That we don't know yet.
[00:49:37.327 --> 00:49:38.828]  I think you'll probably, this is just a
[00:49:39.571 --> 00:49:40.352]  Normally it is.
[00:49:40.632 --> 00:49:43.616]  I think if you really research you might find IBM involved.
[00:49:44.216 --> 00:49:44.517]  Okay.
[00:49:44.897 --> 00:49:52.245]  Because they're really pushing the RFID and the whole grid that's going in and we've caught them in other areas around the country pushing it.
[00:49:52.626 --> 00:49:54.828]  Okay.
[00:49:55.008 --> 00:50:00.795]  We've been afforded the opportunity to take a look at these chips because when my daughter initially came home and said,
[00:50:01.435 --> 00:50:02.636]  Look at what I have to wear.
[00:50:02.696 --> 00:50:04.137]  I feel like I'm a piece of grocery.
[00:50:04.177 --> 00:50:05.198]  I'm a piece of commodity.
[00:50:06.679 --> 00:50:11.122]  On the back of this tag that she's wearing is this big lump about the size of a roll of dimes.
[00:50:12.363 --> 00:50:13.524]  Could not see what it was.
[00:50:13.644 --> 00:50:14.865]  Couldn't feel what it was.
[00:50:15.645 --> 00:50:17.106]  She tells us it's a tracking device.
[00:50:17.206 --> 00:50:19.068]  That's a powerful chip if it's that big.
[00:50:19.348 --> 00:50:29.155]  Well, it's about... The explanation they gave to us was once we finally met with corporate representatives and the technology end of it,
[00:50:29.728 --> 00:50:40.052]  Once we got to see what it was, it's a thin piece of hard paper, or like cardboard type material, with two chips and a series of antennas interwoven in it.
[00:50:40.872 --> 00:50:52.616]  The reason it looks so big is that it's in a half-inch diameter plastic tube, and the explanation there was, well, it has to be kept away from the body because the moisture content interferes with the scanning capabilities.
[00:50:53.056 --> 00:50:57.338]  Yeah, no, no, that's a chip that big, sir, can normally be read from upwards of 100 feet.
[00:50:58.464 --> 00:51:00.446]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[00:51:03.408 --> 00:51:10.273]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:10.573 --> 00:51:11.954]  That's right, folks, DVD.
[00:51:12.134 --> 00:51:14.356]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:14.496 --> 00:51:16.598]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.

[00:51:39.054 --> 00:51:40.955]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:10.910]  I've got a bunch of news.
[00:54:10.930 --> 00:54:14.310]  We'll talk about this new HIV strain popping up in New York.
[00:54:14.850 --> 00:54:19.511]  More fake intelligence being put out by CNN and others to demonize Iran.
[00:54:19.531 --> 00:54:20.272]  That's all coming up.
[00:54:21.932 --> 00:54:30.554]  We're joined by Jeffrey Tatro and his daughter is at this elementary school in Sutter, California.
[00:54:31.434 --> 00:54:37.115]  And folks, they passed the first national ID card law to federally standardize a driver's license.
[00:54:37.955 --> 00:54:40.958]  They gave federal control over that at the state level last year in December.
[00:54:41.018 --> 00:54:48.666]  Now they've passed it in the House to put face scanning, thumb scanning, RFID chips in it by law and to merge that for a Pan-American Union.
[00:54:49.026 --> 00:54:52.770]  We had the Congressman's office on, Ron Paul's office on last week to talk about that.
[00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:53.931]  It's in mainstream news.
[00:54:54.312 --> 00:54:57.996]  So you as adults, forget 10-15 years from now, it's already coming.
[00:54:58.396 --> 00:55:00.058]  And then it meshes with the readers
[00:55:00.598 --> 00:55:02.158]  that are already going in these grocery stores.
[00:55:02.198 --> 00:55:06.839]  And these smart shelving, these more powerful readers can read this from a distance.
[00:55:07.299 --> 00:55:14.421]  A double chip array with larger antenna array, I mean something the size of a grain of sand can be read from a couple feet.
[00:55:14.861 --> 00:55:21.322]  Something as large as what the father was just talking about can be read from hundreds of feet according to industry documents.
[00:55:22.402 --> 00:55:25.923]  Please continue, Jeffrey, with any other comments you have about this.
[00:55:26.636 --> 00:55:53.592]  Well, one of the main messages that we want to get out about this, and you have already touched on it, and that is the fact that once these chips become accepted, and once the technology starts to become more readily accessible, anybody with a chip reader, and these things are as small as a handheld device for taking inventory control in warehouses, anybody with a chip reader can scan any chip
[00:55:54.295 --> 00:55:58.578]  And withdraw whatever information is on that chip, if it's on your driver's license.
[00:55:58.598 --> 00:56:05.021]  They can also make clone chips very easily, or you know, take other existing chips, reprogram them with your code, frame you.
[00:56:05.702 --> 00:56:07.003]  It's big problems, folks.
[00:56:07.083 --> 00:56:09.744]  And imagine governmental Big Brother control of this.
[00:56:10.264 --> 00:56:10.765]  Exactly.
[00:56:11.405 --> 00:56:19.010]  And that's, it's bad enough right now that parents have to constantly watch and monitor their kids and make sure that they're safe.
[00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:21.711]  We've got predators out there lurking around every corner.
[00:56:23.203 --> 00:56:23.303]  The
[00:56:36.354 --> 00:56:38.756]  I can willingly give up some of my privacy.
[00:56:38.916 --> 00:56:43.999]  If I buy a cell phone and I know that it's got a tracking device in it, I willingly accept that.
[00:56:44.139 --> 00:56:52.965]  This is being forced on our children, who we have been told do not have the same civil rights and the same civil liberties that adults do.
[00:56:52.985 --> 00:56:58.809]  Well, they do, and now Dr. Phil says that the government really owns our children and the parents.
[00:56:58.909 --> 00:57:00.270]  I mean, that's just a fraud.
[00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:03.612]  And let me just add something to this, because you're bringing all this up.
[00:57:04.545 --> 00:57:05.588]  Take the cell phone thing.
[00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:10.804]  You should have a choice and now through federal funds they're putting in tracking systems and...
[00:57:11.443 --> 00:57:18.006]  Green Bay, LA, where they can live time type in your name and it automatically shows them where you're at.
[00:57:18.306 --> 00:57:24.329]  You know, first it was in case you're, you know, incapacitated and you called and, help me, I'm stuck, I don't know where I am.
[00:57:24.629 --> 00:57:34.353]  You know, then they can find you, but now they're saying, oh no, we're going to use this to track you and follow you and keep, you know, and oh, even tax you by how fast you're driving.
[00:57:34.873 --> 00:57:39.354]  The cell phone from this reader tower to that reader tower shows you were driving too fast.
[00:57:39.374 --> 00:57:41.715]  I mean, this is a nightmare control system, sir.
[00:57:42.315 --> 00:57:42.775]  Exactly.
[00:57:42.875 --> 00:57:55.179]  Well, that was how it was initially sold to us, was that this was going to make our children safer and more secure, that in the event of an emergency, this device would be able to pinpoint their location on the school grounds.
[00:57:55.579 --> 00:57:58.020]  Well, that's only if they're wearing the thing around their tag.
[00:57:59.351 --> 00:58:00.772]  You know kids as well as I do.
[00:58:00.812 --> 00:58:03.754]  They get to playing with something, jerking on something, they're going to leave it behind.
[00:58:04.254 --> 00:58:12.180]  Now all of a sudden they think little Johnny's in the middle of this burning building when in fact he's standing out in the playground with the rest of his friends watching the place go to the ground.
[00:58:13.401 --> 00:58:14.381]  There's problems with it.
[00:58:14.401 --> 00:58:26.330]  Well you know industry is saying they want to make all employees that go in buildings wear RFID chips and five years ago they bragged about to go to Michael Dell's house, even guests and friends, you have to wear a little tag with an RFID in it.
[00:58:27.392 --> 00:58:29.353]  But as adults, we have a choice there.
[00:58:29.373 --> 00:58:34.094]  Yeah, I'm not going to Michael Dell's house and I'm not taking his little Nazi number.
[00:58:34.395 --> 00:58:34.875]  Exactly.
[00:58:36.535 --> 00:58:43.138]  We have had several comments, well, I have to wear a badge when I go to work in order to get through doorways and whatnot.
[00:58:43.258 --> 00:58:48.220]  Well, that's a condition of your employment if you choose not to accept that condition.
[00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:48.620]  Exactly.
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:50.120]  I tell you what, we're going into the next hour.
[00:58:50.180 --> 00:58:51.181]  Just stay with us a few more minutes.
[00:58:51.221 --> 00:58:51.901]  We'll be back, folks.
[00:58:59.047 --> 00:59:00.528]  It is Monday.
[00:59:00.548 --> 00:59:01.569]  It is Valentine's Day.
[00:59:01.589 --> 00:59:02.930]  It is the 14th day of February 2005.
[00:59:26.770 --> 00:59:29.371]  And I'm Alejandro Jones, your host.
[00:59:31.291 --> 00:59:31.771]  Come on up.
[00:59:31.811 --> 00:59:37.613]  We're going to be, after we take some calls, cover a bunch of news, we're going to be talking to Mothers Against the Draft.
[00:59:37.633 --> 00:59:42.794]  We're going to be getting into this new variety of AIDS virus, HIV virus, that's popped up.
[00:59:42.834 --> 00:59:44.555]  A bunch of big brother police state news.
[00:59:44.975 --> 00:59:48.416]  And we'll talk more about that biggest fire in Madrid history.
[00:59:49.076 --> 00:59:51.737]  And the skyscraper didn't fall, though they told you it would.
[00:59:52.737 --> 00:59:57.681]  No, modern steel buildings have never fallen from fire until 9-11, and they don't after either.
[00:59:58.701 --> 01:00:18.116]  But just here in the last few minutes of this segment, the last hour we were talking to Jeffrey Tetreault, and his daughter goes to Sutter, California, Britain Elementary School, where they have these big RFID tracker chips in their IDs they have to wear around their necks like slaves.
[01:00:18.906 --> 01:00:22.907]  And he said no to this, and so now they said, okay, you don't have to wear it, just have it in your purse.
[01:00:23.147 --> 01:00:25.007]  It's the same thing, it's just as bad.
[01:00:26.007 --> 01:00:26.707]  It's just as bad.
[01:00:26.747 --> 01:00:31.868]  I mean, imagine, 50 years ago, if you told them Americans would be walking around with tags around their necks, you know?
[01:00:32.168 --> 01:00:34.509]  Why not have a little tattoo on your arm?
[01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:40.030]  I mean, IBM helped put that in, and Nazi Germany did categorize and control the population.
[01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:44.911]  They had their technicians there, and now they're behind it today, with this RFID trying to put it into schools.
[01:00:47.245 --> 01:00:52.330]  Jeffrey, we know that out of the gates these technologies are being used for the bad applications.
[01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:54.111]  You know, I'm not saying the technology is bad.
[01:00:54.131 --> 01:00:55.633]  It's like a gun is just a tool.
[01:00:56.834 --> 01:00:58.155]  The gun itself isn't bad.
[01:00:58.195 --> 01:00:59.076]  It's how it's used.
[01:00:59.136 --> 01:01:03.379]  But out of the gates they're using all of this in a bad way, in a forced way.
[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:04.961]  We've got about three minutes left.
[01:01:05.021 --> 01:01:08.384]  Tell us just in a nutshell again what's happened and where you're going in the future.
[01:01:08.929 --> 01:01:14.190]  Well, parents nationwide need to be aware that this technology is out there.
[01:01:14.650 --> 01:01:17.251]  They need to educate themselves about it.
[01:01:17.471 --> 01:01:21.512]  They need to keep an eye on the fact that it may be creeping into their schools.
[01:01:22.973 --> 01:01:28.534]  The company that developed this technology is supposedly what's today the 14th in three days.
[01:01:29.195 --> 01:01:37.747]  In San Antonio, Texas, there's going to be a large convention of school administrators, and this technology is going to be displayed at that convention.
[01:01:38.849 --> 01:01:42.394]  So that will be the first, as opposed to the negative,
[01:01:43.158 --> 01:01:47.643]  Aspect that we're bringing out about it and obviously getting the national attention.
[01:01:47.683 --> 01:01:54.251]  Well again, this is just one company and you look at IBM, I normally see them as the funding mechanism behind a lot of these companies.
[01:01:54.271 --> 01:01:58.295]  They're the prime mover let's say on the infrastructure of this with a few other companies.
[01:01:58.996 --> 01:02:02.360]  But RFID chips are in quite a few schools already.
[01:02:03.403 --> 01:02:19.577]  Well, we have been, from here on the West Coast, dealing with the electronic organizations and whatnot that we have been dealing with so far, we've been told that they know of no other elementary schools that are using this technology in this way, to track students.
[01:02:19.597 --> 01:02:22.720]  Yeah, I think that means this particular company's application, yeah.
[01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:23.941]  Okay, alright.
[01:02:25.442 --> 01:02:30.467]  The main message, Alex, that we want to get out is that we feel no child should ever be tagged and tracked.
[01:02:31.548 --> 01:02:32.889]  It's inherently dangerous.
[01:02:33.810 --> 01:02:37.394]  It exposes them to more possible kidnappings.
[01:02:37.774 --> 01:02:40.376]  It's demeaning by having this thing hung around their neck.
[01:02:40.396 --> 01:02:47.023]  Did you hear about Tennessee where they put the cameras in the school bathroom and then they caught the school putting this stuff on the internet?
[01:02:47.743 --> 01:02:48.544]  The neck of children?
[01:02:51.005 --> 01:02:57.147]  Our school, if I've got just a few minutes, our school did put up security cameras around the perimeter, okay?
[01:02:58.167 --> 01:02:59.587]  We did not object to that.
[01:03:00.407 --> 01:03:03.708]  It's, it's... Sacramento's got them hooked into the police department!
[01:03:04.088 --> 01:03:06.929]  Well, it's what is that information going to be used for?
[01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:11.350]  Are they going to use it to try to curb vandalism and
[01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:16.674]  What they're going to do, sir, is use it to catch your children doing anything wrong to get them into the system.
[01:03:16.694 --> 01:03:17.555]  I have the federal plans.
[01:03:17.575 --> 01:03:20.977]  It's about institutionalizing children, either on the criminal justice system, the welfare system,
[01:03:36.281 --> 01:03:45.930]  Or in the judicial system, they want to get them, you know, psychiatric or criminal or the welfare system.
[01:03:45.970 --> 01:03:47.672]  That's, I tell you what, you've got more to say.
[01:03:47.712 --> 01:03:48.132]  Stay there.
[01:03:48.392 --> 01:03:49.694]  Give you a few more minutes on the other side.
[01:03:49.714 --> 01:03:50.554]  Then we're going to go to your calls.
[01:03:50.614 --> 01:03:51.315]  I promise, folks.
[01:03:51.595 --> 01:03:51.976]  Stay with us.
[01:03:55.376 --> 01:03:59.721]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:59.901 --> 01:04:04.307]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:04.467 --> 01:04:08.852]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:08.892 --> 01:04:10.254]  The New World Order.
[01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:16.238]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:16.298 --> 01:04:23.243]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:23.363 --> 01:04:25.405]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:25.725 --> 01:04:36.033]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:36.493 --> 01:04:41.758]  If you want to understand what the new rule order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:04:56.457 --> 01:04:57.497]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:04:57.817 --> 01:05:00.618]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:05:00.878 --> 01:05:05.040]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:06.300]  So what do you do?
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:11.162]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:11.662 --> 01:05:13.783]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:14.283 --> 01:05:15.183]  Sheltering in Place.
[01:05:15.583 --> 01:05:19.284]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.

[01:06:02.723 --> 01:06:06.944]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:06:07.184 --> 01:06:14.226]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:06:14.586 --> 01:06:20.688]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:06:20.848 --> 01:06:22.048]  There are no side effects.
[01:06:22.408 --> 01:06:25.351]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:06:25.511 --> 01:06:27.533]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.

[01:07:03.011 --> 01:07:04.113]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:04.753 --> 01:07:05.615]  You want answers?
[01:07:06.335 --> 01:07:07.216]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:07.236 --> 01:07:11.822]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:12.082 --> 01:07:16.187]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:22.677 --> 01:07:25.023]  Alright, poll free number to join us on air is 1-800-255-99-231.
[01:07:25.043 --> 01:07:27.529]  We're now 8 minutes and 35 seconds into this Valentine's Day edition.
[01:07:33.465 --> 01:07:50.061]  And we're talking, just for a few more minutes, we're going to your calls, to Jeffrey Tetro and his daughters in the elementary school in Sutter, California, Britain Elementary School, where they have to wear these RFID ID cards around their necks, it tracks and traces everything they do.
[01:07:50.662 --> 01:07:52.283]  He said, no, they're not wearing it around their necks.
[01:07:52.303 --> 01:07:53.745]  So they said, okay, just have it in their purse.
[01:07:54.867 --> 01:07:56.628]  The point is you've got to get rid of these things, period.
[01:07:56.668 --> 01:07:58.550]  This is all part of this control grid.
[01:07:59.391 --> 01:08:01.512]  They passed the national ID card last week.
[01:08:01.552 --> 01:08:05.555]  Now they're going to try to force the states to put these in your driver's license and ID cards.
[01:08:06.056 --> 01:08:08.237]  Then the readers at the grocery store can read it, too.
[01:08:09.418 --> 01:08:11.159]  They track everything you buy, sell, and do.
[01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:14.282]  You had a few other comments you wanted to make, Mr. Tetrault.
[01:08:14.642 --> 01:08:21.687]  Well, I'd just like to clarify that we have instructed our daughter her student body ID card is separate from the RFID chip.
[01:08:21.968 --> 01:08:22.368]  Oh, good.
[01:08:22.408 --> 01:08:23.469]  I was confused by that.
[01:08:23.549 --> 01:08:26.071]  Yeah, her student body ID card is in her purse.
[01:08:26.091 --> 01:08:30.214]  Now, the students here have had these student body ID cards for years.
[01:08:30.794 --> 01:08:34.257]  It's a way of getting them into dances, sporting events.
[01:08:35.197 --> 01:08:37.519]  It also helps them... Discounts at the movie theater.
[01:08:37.959 --> 01:08:39.300]  Discounts at movie theaters.
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:40.401]  Yeah, you name it.
[01:08:42.182 --> 01:08:44.744]  I've had student body cards years in the past.
[01:08:45.565 --> 01:08:48.927]  The RFID technology is now back in the hands of the school.
[01:08:49.127 --> 01:08:53.850]  Now again, describe the two separate forms of ID.
[01:08:54.690 --> 01:09:05.377]  There is the student body ID card, which has the school name, their school year, their grade, also has their name photo on it, and it also has a four digit number
[01:09:06.039 --> 01:09:06.399]  Thank you.
[01:09:20.347 --> 01:09:23.970]  Tucked away in a purse, in a wallet, in their pocket, somewhere.
[01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:31.235]  But now they want them to wear this and didn't tell you just suddenly the kids came home from school and we gotta wear this around our neck?
[01:09:31.635 --> 01:09:35.538]  There had been rumors coming home for about six weeks.
[01:09:35.578 --> 01:09:38.920]  We're gonna be getting ID tags, we're gonna be getting ID tags, we're gonna be getting ID tags.
[01:09:39.421 --> 01:09:40.541]  We didn't know what it was.
[01:09:41.042 --> 01:09:46.606]  Most of us parents just kind of took a, we'll just wait and see what's going on since we haven't heard anything official from the school.
[01:09:47.262 --> 01:10:00.150]  Then all of a sudden she comes home with this 4x5 sized black ziplock pouch with her ID card in front that's clearly visible and this big roll on the back of it that contains this chip.
[01:10:02.908 --> 01:10:04.689]  That has all been turned back in.
[01:10:04.849 --> 01:10:09.792]  The only thing she has right now is this very benign ID card that is tucked in her purse.
[01:10:09.812 --> 01:10:16.995]  How many of the children at Brinton Elementary School, how many parents have had their children turned back in the slide cards?
[01:10:18.176 --> 01:10:24.022]  Very few, because very few parents have taken the time to try to educate themselves as to what this is.
[01:10:24.503 --> 01:10:35.674]  Some of the lower grades, I know Kidney Garden for a fact, because I've spoken to one parent of a Kidney Garden student, those students don't even take these tags home.
[01:10:36.675 --> 01:10:38.437]  So the parents haven't even had
[01:10:39.514 --> 01:10:42.575]  A chance to examine them in their home environment.
[01:10:42.615 --> 01:10:46.997]  When they check in at the prison in the morning, they get the slave tag put around their neck.
[01:10:47.197 --> 01:10:48.958]  When they leave, they take the slave tag off.
[01:10:49.358 --> 01:10:49.939]  Exactly.
[01:10:50.299 --> 01:10:50.799]  Exactly.
[01:10:51.279 --> 01:10:52.420]  That's exactly right.
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:11:00.003]  So again, describe on the back of this ID card they wear around their neck how big the chip enclosure is.
[01:11:00.203 --> 01:11:05.366]  It's a half inch diameter square plastic tube that is flexible.
[01:11:05.486 --> 01:11:08.347]  It's capped on either end with red rubber caps.
[01:11:09.213 --> 01:11:15.816]  And the chip piece inside there is about three to three and a half inches long and about a half an inch wide.
[01:11:16.816 --> 01:11:26.820]  Right in the center are two approximately eighth inch diameter squares, which we have been told are the actual chips themselves.
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:32.683]  And then attached to these two little chips is a complex series of antennas.
[01:11:32.723 --> 01:11:35.884]  How long would those antennas be, would you say, if you unfolded them?
[01:11:36.704 --> 01:11:38.545]  We were told that they are several feet long.
[01:11:39.965 --> 01:11:43.886]  Sir, that can be read from hundreds of yards.
[01:11:43.926 --> 01:11:46.087]  We've had industry specialists on.
[01:11:46.347 --> 01:11:53.389]  Again, they have Hitachi chips now going in Gillette razors and others for the last two years that are
[01:11:54.503 --> 01:11:58.666]  A fourth the size of a grain of sand that can be read from 5 feet.
[01:11:59.927 --> 01:12:06.992]  And then transponders in cars that can be read from 200 feet are about a foot long.
[01:12:07.413 --> 01:12:10.435]  How long again did they tell you these wires are?
[01:12:11.056 --> 01:12:13.099]  All they said was they were several feet long.
[01:12:13.259 --> 01:12:13.860]  Unbelievable.
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:16.444]  That is a high-powered transponder.
[01:12:16.724 --> 01:12:16.924]  Yep.
[01:12:17.545 --> 01:12:19.047]  Oh, that is unbelievable.
[01:12:19.127 --> 01:12:24.735]  And that's our concern, that this technology, they can implant any information on that chip.
[01:12:25.473 --> 01:12:30.355]  And anybody with a reader or a scanner can scan that chip as you're walking down the street.
[01:12:30.375 --> 01:12:31.496]  And the worst group is the government.
[01:12:31.516 --> 01:12:32.956]  I mean, that's the most untrustworthy group.
[01:12:33.276 --> 01:12:34.257]  This is out of control.
[01:12:34.277 --> 01:12:35.977]  Well, sir, I want to thank you for coming on.
[01:12:36.057 --> 01:12:38.719]  You know, this was in the Sacramento Bee and other papers in your area.
[01:12:38.939 --> 01:12:40.099]  It's gotten national attention.
[01:12:40.119 --> 01:12:44.621]  They're admitting this is a national fight, because they can force this there, they can force this anywhere.
[01:12:45.541 --> 01:12:46.622]  Have you been on local radio?
[01:12:47.703 --> 01:12:51.692]  We've done some local radio interviews.
[01:12:52.052 --> 01:12:55.159]  We've done an awful lot of newspaper and magazine interviews.
[01:12:55.259 --> 01:12:57.684]  Are the hosts against this or are they telling you you're evil?
[01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:07.026]  Yes, that has been the response.
[01:13:07.206 --> 01:13:12.430]  I've done 2,000 interviews across the country and your state is so controlled.
[01:13:12.851 --> 01:13:18.415]  Everywhere I go the hosts agree with us, they're waking up, they're involved, conservative, liberal, but in California
[01:13:18.995 --> 01:13:20.476]  I mean, you talk about control.
[01:13:20.636 --> 01:13:30.703]  I've just noticed, that's why your state's so bad off, is that it's just, there's such, anything Big Brother, anything that destroys liberty, your media is just out of control.
[01:13:31.143 --> 01:13:34.365]  Well, we are so used to just accepting technology.
[01:13:34.666 --> 01:13:38.188]  Oh, well it's new technology, it's going to make us safer and more secure and whatnot.
[01:13:38.588 --> 01:13:39.709]  It's got to be good.
[01:13:40.149 --> 01:13:41.270]  You need to look into it.
[01:13:41.690 --> 01:13:43.371]  You need to really study up on it.
[01:13:43.531 --> 01:13:46.934]  Well, you need to just continue to reach out to the parents, and you need to go to
[01:13:47.944 --> 01:13:59.092]  I'm going to start going to the school board meetings and make a big deal out of this and do like a little two-page print up of news facts about RFID and just keep fighting it and God bless you.
[01:13:59.132 --> 01:14:00.633]  I want to commend you for what you're doing, sir.
[01:14:00.853 --> 01:14:02.374]  You ought to start a website, Jeffrey.
[01:14:03.485 --> 01:14:04.746]  That's a definite possibility.
[01:14:05.027 --> 01:14:09.851]  Yes, there are several other parents who have said no, who have filed their letters of complaint, and who have turned the RFID technology back into the school.
[01:14:27.227 --> 01:14:38.573]  Some of the parents have hung on to the RFID technology as a display purpose for when we get this media coverage, we can hold this up and say, this is what our kids are wearing, this is what it looks like.
[01:14:38.593 --> 01:14:47.497]  It would be horrible to spread word in the school that if you put it in the microwave for about three seconds, not longer, it'll catch on fire, but three seconds in the microwave, these things are going to be worthless.
[01:14:48.357 --> 01:14:50.638]  I already let that cat out of the bag.
[01:14:54.388 --> 01:15:03.492]  That was something that we came across on the internet and during one of our public meetings at a neutral site here in town.
[01:15:03.552 --> 01:15:05.512]  Most of our meetings have been conducted at the school.
[01:15:05.973 --> 01:15:08.774]  We decided to have a meeting for any concerned parent.
[01:15:09.514 --> 01:15:10.815]  Any input was welcome.
[01:15:11.895 --> 01:15:13.276]  Those that were for it were there.
[01:15:13.396 --> 01:15:15.857]  Those that were against it were obviously there.
[01:15:16.657 --> 01:15:22.762]  And I did mention how this technology is fallible based on the company's information.
[01:15:22.862 --> 01:15:24.464]  Look, it's not American.
[01:15:24.524 --> 01:15:25.505]  It's not the way to go.
[01:15:25.565 --> 01:15:26.526]  Thanks for joining us, sir.
[01:15:26.746 --> 01:15:27.867]  Thank you very much for your time.
[01:15:28.027 --> 01:15:28.547]  God bless you.
[01:15:28.587 --> 01:15:29.168]  Good to hear from you.
[01:15:29.188 --> 01:15:37.275]  Let's take a few calls and we'll get into the new AIDS virus, HIV virus that's popped up, and the latest manufactured evidence to go after Iran.
[01:15:37.295 --> 01:15:38.656]  There's just so much of it.
[01:15:39.176 --> 01:15:45.043]  Yeah, I saw that building burning in Madrid and a friend and I sat and watched that and immediately thought of 9-11.
[01:16:01.617 --> 01:16:13.663]  Yeah, Building 7 burned for a few hours, small fires, collapsed perfectly, but no steel building had ever collapsed, but then magically this one burns for almost two days and has giant hundred foot white flames shooting out and didn't fall.
[01:16:13.983 --> 01:16:22.528]  Now if anybody can't see that those buildings, well Trade Center 7, the fires didn't bring those down.
[01:16:23.291 --> 01:16:23.811]  Obviously.
[01:16:23.991 --> 01:16:28.454]  If people buy that story, then we are truly stupid as an American people.
[01:16:28.594 --> 01:16:38.098]  But the globalists know this, so when in Caracas, when that building burned, you know, fires ten times worse than seven, that didn't collapse, they kept going, well, some sheet rock, some of the ceilings collapsed.
[01:16:38.118 --> 01:16:39.839]  Yes, that's of course, but not the superstructure.
[01:16:39.859 --> 01:16:41.680]  Oh yeah, after it's been burning for hours and hours.
[01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:44.001]  But that's not the metal, it's just, you know, the junk.
[01:16:44.381 --> 01:16:45.182]  I had a question.
[01:16:45.202 --> 01:16:46.804]  With this new AIDS virus strand,
[01:16:58.403 --> 01:17:01.205]  I firmly believe that they have a cure for AIDS.
[01:17:01.445 --> 01:17:02.165]  Oh, it's admitted.
[01:17:02.205 --> 01:17:03.887]  And they had Nobel laureates go public.
[01:17:04.167 --> 01:17:11.712]  We have the actual documents where it was bioengineered by the Department of Defense in the late 1970s.
[01:17:11.752 --> 01:17:15.175]  So is this just the first... It's public, sir.
[01:17:15.215 --> 01:17:15.875]  It's not even debated.
[01:17:15.895 --> 01:17:18.858]  Right, but you mentioned the population of the world.
[01:17:18.898 --> 01:17:22.340]  This is just another way of slowly, incrementally doing that.
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:26.083]  They don't like to say it, but HIV is race-specific.
[01:17:26.899 --> 01:17:40.110]  It'll kill Anglos, but it is more effective, and if you notice the numbers, you know, I mean, it's much higher amongst people of certain racial derivations.
[01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:40.951]  Ah, okay.
[01:17:41.671 --> 01:17:42.492]  Well, thanks for your time.
[01:17:42.732 --> 01:17:43.292]  Anything else?
[01:17:43.533 --> 01:17:44.213]  No, that was it.
[01:17:44.233 --> 01:17:49.297]  Just, you know, the new age trend, I mean, like I was saying, I firmly believe it.
[01:17:49.337 --> 01:17:53.420]  And I often wondered about the Magic Johnson thing, too, because he announced he had AIDS back in 91.
[01:17:54.813 --> 01:17:55.514]  I believe it was.
[01:17:55.714 --> 01:17:57.456]  Well, the elite get the cure.
[01:17:57.476 --> 01:18:00.780]  Remember when he went public and said, I've been given the cure, I'm fine now?
[01:18:02.141 --> 01:18:04.364]  Yeah, I barely remember that.
[01:18:04.384 --> 01:18:05.745]  Yeah, Tommy Morrison said it too.
[01:18:05.846 --> 01:18:06.947]  I interviewed him, yeah.
[01:18:07.447 --> 01:18:09.129]  I have the cure, and end of story.
[01:18:09.630 --> 01:18:10.110]  Amazing.
[01:18:10.491 --> 01:18:11.792]  Alright, thank you for your time.
[01:18:11.912 --> 01:18:12.273]  Thank you!
[01:18:16.454 --> 01:18:18.656]  They don't get the cure to most people, unfortunately.
[01:18:19.917 --> 01:18:21.958]  Let's... What's so dangerous about blood transfusions?
[01:18:21.978 --> 01:18:22.599]  We're going to break.
[01:18:22.979 --> 01:18:24.080]  We'll come back with Kim and others.
[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:28.623]  We're going to take some calls.
[01:18:28.663 --> 01:18:32.006]  Then we'll get back into the news.
[01:18:32.026 --> 01:18:34.328]  1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 And we'll get you up and on the air.
[01:18:34.348 --> 01:18:35.329]  Don't forget the websites.

[01:18:56.926 --> 01:18:58.067]  All water isn't the same.
[01:18:58.347 --> 01:19:03.332]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[01:19:03.592 --> 01:19:06.194]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[01:19:06.415 --> 01:19:14.942]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.
[01:19:15.322 --> 01:19:18.125]  AquaNorthwest.com carries a full line of products,

[01:19:56.836 --> 01:19:59.158]  Hi folks, Jack Browner from Midas Resources.
[01:19:59.438 --> 01:20:00.459]  The real money folks.
[01:20:03.789 --> 01:20:05.730]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[01:20:06.210 --> 01:20:07.130]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[01:20:07.170 --> 01:20:08.671]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.

[01:20:58.650 --> 01:21:06.037]  On February 29, 1892, the United States of America's Supreme Court declared us a Christian nation.
[01:21:07.138 --> 01:21:16.807]  However, over recent years, for the last three decades, there's been a deliberate war on Christianity in America to wipe out our heritage from the minds of our people.
[01:21:17.708 --> 01:21:24.314]  The First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees us religious freedom, and yet it's under attack today.

[01:21:55.023 --> 01:21:56.624]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:21:56.984 --> 01:22:02.725]  You know that murky water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:22:02.985 --> 01:22:08.127]  The murky light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:22:08.467 --> 01:22:17.730]  The self-sterilizing black murky elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:23.053]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:22:23.373 --> 01:22:27.396]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:22:27.596 --> 01:22:32.359]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:22:32.719 --> 01:22:38.623]  The Murky Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:22:38.963 --> 01:22:43.227]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:22:43.247 --> 01:22:45.168]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:11.494 --> 01:23:15.736]  You know, I played it on Coast to Coast AM when I was on as a guest a few weeks ago.
[01:23:16.236 --> 01:23:18.817]  Had it on the website, but haven't played it on my own broadcast.
[01:23:20.238 --> 01:23:26.840]  And so later, we're going to play the... I don't even have the CD I had of it here at the office, so I'll have the network up there.
[01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:31.182]  Download a little six minute piece with three different clips.
[01:23:32.046 --> 01:23:39.930]  As I confront David Gergen, the equivalent of a super Karl Rove, before presidents about the satanic rituals at Bohemian Grove.
[01:23:39.950 --> 01:23:41.951]  I think you'll find his response interesting.
[01:23:42.652 --> 01:23:45.093]  And then of course where I confront Michael Moore.
[01:23:45.934 --> 01:23:53.658]  It's a little clip of that, but a clip where I confront a secret police officer of the secret police in New York taking photos of peaceful demonstrators.
[01:23:54.218 --> 01:23:55.599]  And I go and get in his face.
[01:23:57.254 --> 01:24:00.118]  So that is coming up as well.
[01:24:00.298 --> 01:24:01.840]  Right now, Kim in Texas.
[01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:02.641]  Kim, go ahead.
[01:24:02.661 --> 01:24:04.343]  Hi, Alex.
[01:24:04.403 --> 01:24:09.590]  You said, what, two years ago that they were going to make the barcode and the chip real popular?
[01:24:10.371 --> 01:24:14.917]  Well, the singer, Pink, has a barcode tattooed on the back of her neck.
[01:24:17.208 --> 01:24:17.768]  Well, yeah.
[01:24:17.808 --> 01:24:26.570]  No, I said that they would push the slave grid with Hollywood people talking about how they've gotten the chip and making barcodes and stuff fashionable.
[01:24:26.990 --> 01:24:28.570]  And yes, it's a big fashion craze.
[01:24:28.610 --> 01:24:30.691]  So are swastikas.
[01:24:30.731 --> 01:24:34.852]  Women like to wear little swastikas now on their belly buttons or other areas.
[01:24:35.352 --> 01:24:37.372]  And so just lots of ultra-decadent stuff.
[01:24:37.392 --> 01:24:41.453]  See, as you get more and more decadent, you've got to do something new, something more out of control.
[01:24:42.253 --> 01:24:42.433]  Right.
[01:24:42.493 --> 01:24:44.634]  So she has a tattoo of a barcode on her neck.
[01:24:44.694 --> 01:24:45.574]  I see a lot of those.
[01:24:47.466 --> 01:24:48.627]  Okay, I haven't seen it.
[01:24:48.647 --> 01:24:50.469]  That was just so strange to me.
[01:24:50.749 --> 01:24:51.890]  Well, where did you hear about it?
[01:24:51.930 --> 01:24:57.414]  I mean, who's... I saw it on... She was promoting her new CD.
[01:24:58.976 --> 01:24:59.536]  Her new what?
[01:25:00.157 --> 01:25:01.578]  She was promoting her CD.
[01:25:02.198 --> 01:25:02.719]  Okay.
[01:25:02.779 --> 01:25:04.460]  Uh-huh.
[01:25:04.921 --> 01:25:07.263]  And she, what, had a barcode on her?
[01:25:08.143 --> 01:25:11.026]  Yeah, on the CD and on the back of her neck.
[01:25:13.991 --> 01:25:15.452]  She has a badge.
[01:25:15.512 --> 01:25:18.013]  I mean if it's on the CD, I'd imagine she's pretty proud of it.
[01:25:18.033 --> 01:25:19.653]  What did she say about the barcode?
[01:25:20.934 --> 01:25:23.835]  She said it's just something that she thought she should advertise.
[01:25:24.415 --> 01:25:26.056]  It may be to help sell her CD.
[01:25:26.696 --> 01:25:28.537]  To have it tattooed on the back of her neck.
[01:25:28.797 --> 01:25:30.338]  Which I don't understand how that would help.
[01:25:31.929 --> 01:25:33.230]  Oh, so it's the CD.
[01:25:33.950 --> 01:25:36.832]  It's the particular barcode for that particular CD.
[01:25:37.252 --> 01:25:37.632]  Uh-huh.
[01:25:38.092 --> 01:25:39.753]  Then she got it tattooed on the back of her neck.
[01:25:40.213 --> 01:25:40.473]  Right.
[01:25:40.493 --> 01:25:42.955]  And then she said she might sell more if she did that, huh?
[01:25:43.555 --> 01:25:47.397]  Yeah, I don't know how, but... And also... What's her name?
[01:25:47.417 --> 01:25:49.158]  I don't know the person.
[01:25:49.818 --> 01:25:50.118]  Pink.
[01:25:51.699 --> 01:25:53.100]  Pink hair all the time.
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:58.002]  Um... She sings punk sometimes and R&B.
[01:25:58.822 --> 01:25:59.903]  Oh, it's a hip-hop thing.
[01:26:00.453 --> 01:26:02.114]  No, no, she's not hip-hop.
[01:26:04.756 --> 01:26:07.478]  Oh, so she's an R&B artist in doing it, huh?
[01:26:07.498 --> 01:26:09.079]  No, no, she's a Caucasian.
[01:26:09.099 --> 01:26:14.803]  She just, um, she can sing R&B and, but mostly kind of a punk rock.
[01:26:16.044 --> 01:26:17.265]  Kind of like Britney Spears.
[01:26:17.705 --> 01:26:19.106]  Yeah, sounds like a punk to me.
[01:26:20.627 --> 01:26:24.930]  And also, a friend of y'all was watching Meet the Press, and they had Buchanan.
[01:26:25.530 --> 01:26:29.553]  Now, I really don't like this guy, but he was talking the way you talk, Alex.
[01:26:30.632 --> 01:26:33.434]  He was bringing up the Constitution, John Quincy Adams.
[01:26:34.154 --> 01:26:37.276]  He was saying this is not how America should be.
[01:26:37.677 --> 01:26:45.802]  He was going against that guy from Russia that we helped get out of prison in 81 or something when Reagan was president.
[01:26:45.902 --> 01:26:47.383]  Alexander Sholtsanitsa?
[01:26:47.944 --> 01:26:48.284]  Yes.
[01:26:48.544 --> 01:26:50.025]  What was he saying about Sholtsanitsa?
[01:26:50.465 --> 01:26:52.787]  They were both there and Sholtsanitsa took his out.
[01:26:53.692 --> 01:26:58.120]  About democracy and... Oh yeah, I gotta get Shelton Itza on.
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:26:59.623]  I knew he had a new book coming out.
[01:26:59.663 --> 01:27:00.865]  I'm glad you told me about that.
[01:27:00.926 --> 01:27:02.769]  That's a good reminder.
[01:27:03.029 --> 01:27:04.933]  No, listen, I campaigned for Buchanan in 96.
[01:27:06.542 --> 01:27:06.902]  Or was it 98?
[01:27:06.982 --> 01:27:08.003]  No, it was 96.
[01:27:08.183 --> 01:27:10.824]  That was the presidential election, duh.
[01:27:10.844 --> 01:27:12.145]  With Bob Dole and Bill Clinton.
[01:27:12.705 --> 01:27:15.367]  And I don't think against Pat Buchanan, I'm giving him thousands of dollars.
[01:27:15.407 --> 01:27:16.667]  The problem is he flip-flops.
[01:27:17.168 --> 01:27:18.989]  Before the war, he's against it.
[01:27:19.029 --> 01:27:20.209]  Then during it, he's for it.
[01:27:20.249 --> 01:27:22.210]  And Bush is doing a great job.
[01:27:22.831 --> 01:27:27.013]  Then I had him on about Bohemian Grove, as we're about to play this Bergen clip coming up.
[01:27:27.685 --> 01:27:29.887]  And I said, so, you've been to Bohemian Grove, I read.
[01:27:29.907 --> 01:27:31.068]  He goes, yeah, yeah, it's great.
[01:27:31.088 --> 01:27:31.748]  They're in the Redwoods.
[01:27:31.768 --> 01:27:35.571]  And I said, so I started mentioning the ritual, and he goes, how do you know about that?
[01:27:35.952 --> 01:27:36.912]  I go, well, I was there.
[01:27:36.973 --> 01:27:38.294]  And then he did a double take.
[01:27:38.314 --> 01:27:39.715]  He went, I was never there.
[01:27:39.795 --> 01:27:40.495]  I was mistaken.
[01:27:41.036 --> 01:27:42.017]  And I said, no, you weren't.
[01:27:42.057 --> 01:27:43.278]  I've got it in the news you were there.
[01:27:43.718 --> 01:27:44.298]  With Nixon.
[01:27:45.099 --> 01:27:45.740]  Wow.
[01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:53.105]  And, uh, yeah, and you know, it's just, I mean, I'm tired of, everybody's seen him flip-flop.
[01:27:53.646 --> 01:27:54.567]  And I'm tired of it.
[01:27:54.627 --> 01:27:56.148]  And no, I mean, I like Pat Buchanan.
[01:27:56.977 --> 01:27:58.718]  I mean, I used to idolize Pat Buchanan.
[01:27:59.759 --> 01:28:05.944]  Uh, but, uh... You know, he's a... I'm sorry to have to tell you, he's a snake in the grass.
[01:28:06.465 --> 01:28:07.486]  Oh yeah, I saw that.
[01:28:08.026 --> 01:28:12.990]  But I'm just... Just the fact that he brought out the information, and the guy who... I forget his name.
[01:28:13.010 --> 01:28:14.011]  We'll cut the tape there.
[01:28:14.091 --> 01:28:14.612]  Meet the press.
[01:28:15.012 --> 01:28:16.773]  Did not challenge him on any of that.
[01:28:19.516 --> 01:28:21.257]  He never asked him the hard questions.
[01:28:21.677 --> 01:28:25.821]  So, what was, uh, Shelton Eaton and Buchanan bringing up?
[01:28:26.596 --> 01:28:29.036]  Well, he was saying how he was for Bush.
[01:28:29.056 --> 01:28:39.218]  Shostakovich was saying that how what he was doing in Iraq was great and we should be, and Bush, they showed Bush saying the clip that how he was, he was thinking the same thing as Bush was saying.
[01:28:39.238 --> 01:28:40.659]  That was his whole game plan.
[01:28:41.299 --> 01:28:42.959]  That Shostakovich was in his mind.
[01:28:42.999 --> 01:28:43.239]  By what?
[01:28:43.259 --> 01:28:43.599]  Stay there.
[01:28:43.619 --> 01:28:44.499]  I want to hear more about this.

[01:32:02.937 --> 01:32:05.779]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:08.101 --> 01:32:09.282]  Alright, Kim hung up.
[01:32:09.362 --> 01:32:12.104]  I wanted to hear more from her about Meet the Press.
[01:32:12.124 --> 01:32:16.448]  Maybe a listener will fall in and tell me, was Schultz and Nietzsche saying this war is good?
[01:32:16.468 --> 01:32:26.976]  I mean, I've read some news articles, some editorials he'd written over the years about how America's turning into Russia, and how we're losing all our freedoms, and he'd been kind of rebuffed.
[01:32:28.263 --> 01:32:30.784]  And Shelton eats up there saying the war is good.
[01:32:30.804 --> 01:32:33.225]  That's pretty suspicious if that's the case.
[01:32:34.446 --> 01:32:36.887]  Let's go ahead and talk to Wesley in Tennessee.
[01:32:36.927 --> 01:32:37.627]  You're on the air.
[01:32:37.727 --> 01:32:38.208]  Go ahead.
[01:32:40.068 --> 01:32:40.749]  Happy St.
[01:32:40.789 --> 01:32:41.909]  Valentine's Day to you.
[01:32:42.329 --> 01:32:43.470]  Yes, thank you for calling.
[01:32:44.210 --> 01:32:54.315]  I'm calling to beg and plead with radio show announcers across the country.
[01:32:54.855 --> 01:32:56.376]  And I'm excluding yourself.
[01:32:57.352 --> 01:33:25.616]  from this group of course, but I heard a radio talk show just a few days ago that I would just rather not name, but they had on us a guest one of these very highly educated and very knowledgeable disinformation specialists about the Koran and about the religion of Islam.
[01:33:27.382 --> 01:33:33.446]  And the host admitted that he had no knowledge of the Quran.
[01:33:34.887 --> 01:33:38.450]  If you're going to invite these guys on your program... Well, give us specifics.
[01:33:38.510 --> 01:33:40.451]  I mean, you're saying disinformation specialists.
[01:33:40.751 --> 01:33:41.512]  What was he saying?
[01:33:42.032 --> 01:33:47.576]  Well, for example, that the Muslims love Jesus.
[01:33:48.877 --> 01:33:51.959]  That they have a high regard for him.
[01:33:53.252 --> 01:33:56.753]  And that he was truly one of the great prophets.
[01:33:56.873 --> 01:33:58.734]  Well, bingo!
[01:33:58.994 --> 01:34:00.614]  There's the word prophet.
[01:34:00.734 --> 01:34:03.195]  Jesus was not prophet.
[01:34:03.615 --> 01:34:04.775]  He did prophesy.
[01:34:05.795 --> 01:34:09.416]  But he was God in a human body.
[01:34:10.397 --> 01:34:17.219]  He was not just simply a mortal man the way they just tried to pass him off.
[01:34:17.699 --> 01:34:20.319]  And they want you to believe that
[01:34:22.902 --> 01:34:38.611]  Anti-Semitic comments, anti-Christian comments that come out of the Koran are taken out of context by these terrible Christians, really, that they have an agenda against those poor little Islamics.
[01:34:42.393 --> 01:34:49.177]  If radio show hosts are going to invite these guys in, they owe it to themselves.
[01:34:50.001 --> 01:34:56.747]  And they owe it to their audience in particular to go out and buy that copy.
[01:34:57.127 --> 01:34:58.208]  Listen, thanks for the call.
[01:34:58.548 --> 01:35:00.189]  Let me just comment on this briefly.
[01:35:01.670 --> 01:35:02.871]  I'm obviously not a Muslim.
[01:35:03.692 --> 01:35:04.693]  Okay, I'm a Baptist.
[01:35:05.674 --> 01:35:18.364]  But don't please compare me to these Baptist churches having UN days and gun buyback days and that tell their clock don't talk about politics in the pews or at lunch on Sunday.
[01:35:19.850 --> 01:35:29.977]  But, there are different bodies of Muslim thought and some areas of the Middle East, Christians are left alone and honored and are treated nicely.
[01:35:31.158 --> 01:35:35.360]  In other areas, if a Christian sticks their nose out of their house, it gets blown off.
[01:35:36.941 --> 01:35:40.124]  Christians can't live in Saudi Arabia but in armored compounds.
[01:35:40.164 --> 01:35:40.904]  I mean, that's a fact.
[01:35:40.964 --> 01:35:43.766]  I've had families worked over there in the oil fields.
[01:35:43.846 --> 01:35:45.367]  I mean, engineers.
[01:35:45.447 --> 01:35:46.128]  I mean, I know.
[01:35:46.608 --> 01:35:47.809]  I know directly from family.
[01:35:47.849 --> 01:35:49.450]  It is, they will kill you
[01:35:50.225 --> 01:35:51.486]  And that's horrible, and that's wrong.
[01:35:51.806 --> 01:35:55.208]  But then the media goes, look at the Muslims, they all want to kill us, see what it's like.
[01:35:55.469 --> 01:35:58.050]  Well, look at the one country we're total allies with!
[01:35:59.311 --> 01:36:02.313]  I mean, just, it's Saudi Arabia.
[01:36:02.373 --> 01:36:03.934]  I mean, Saudi Arabia is just horrible.
[01:36:05.475 --> 01:36:19.345]  Now, the Quran itself does say nice things about Jesus Christ, but it contradicts itself, and then it says bad things about Christians, and you know what, I'm just not, boy, that'll open a can of worms.
[01:36:20.086 --> 01:36:22.228]  I am just not going to get into a debate.
[01:36:22.248 --> 01:36:28.514]  I mean, there's hundreds of Christian sects and hundreds of Muslim sects, and I don't want to... I just don't want to go there.
[01:36:28.934 --> 01:36:36.941]  I'm not a Muslim, but I respect people's rights to be Muslims, and I don't think every Muslim wants to kill every non-Muslim.
[01:36:37.001 --> 01:36:38.062]  I mean, that's just not the case.
[01:36:38.082 --> 01:36:44.188]  Look at Egypt, look at Jordan, look at Palestine, look at all these places.
[01:36:45.771 --> 01:36:47.772]  Look at Iraq before, quote, the liberation.
[01:36:47.792 --> 01:36:49.352]  Christians, you know, we're left alone.
[01:36:49.872 --> 01:36:50.933]  I mean, we're in positions of power.
[01:36:50.953 --> 01:36:52.053]  Tariq Aziz, a Catholic.
[01:36:52.853 --> 01:37:04.117]  But you, their foreign minister, but you start, uh, I mean, I hear the neocon saying all Muslims basically drink blood and they want to kill you and they got horns and a tail under their clothes.
[01:37:04.457 --> 01:37:05.057]  It's not true.
[01:37:06.737 --> 01:37:10.879]  Uh, but, uh, are there areas where they want to kill you?
[01:37:10.919 --> 01:37:11.259]  Yes.
[01:37:12.339 --> 01:37:14.800]  And it's not the areas our government wants to attack.
[01:37:16.307 --> 01:37:18.048]  I mean, Christians are all over Syria.
[01:37:18.508 --> 01:37:20.249]  There's Christian churches all over Syria.
[01:37:20.269 --> 01:37:21.530]  They're totally left alone.
[01:37:22.090 --> 01:37:22.730]  They're honored.
[01:37:26.172 --> 01:37:31.715]  In Iran, there's a lot of Christians, but they're just not allowed to go out and preach.
[01:37:32.275 --> 01:37:33.336]  And I think that's wrong.
[01:37:34.076 --> 01:37:34.957]  Same thing in Israel.
[01:37:35.037 --> 01:37:41.040]  You preach the Bible, the Word of God, in Israel, which was written by Jews.
[01:37:41.260 --> 01:37:41.940]  Pretty ridiculous.
[01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:43.761]  Inspired by God.
[01:37:44.661 --> 01:37:45.602]  You will be arrested.
[01:37:46.823 --> 01:37:48.584]  If you don't believe me, just type it in.
[01:37:48.604 --> 01:37:51.885]  Type in, Haratz, Christians arrested for preaching.
[01:37:51.925 --> 01:37:53.126]  Just go read a Jewish newspaper.
[01:37:53.386 --> 01:37:55.907]  And they'll tell you, well, we can't have them causing problems.
[01:37:56.687 --> 01:37:58.408]  So, why is that okay?
[01:37:58.628 --> 01:37:59.068]  It's not.
[01:37:59.128 --> 01:38:02.650]  But no, in Israel, they don't shotgun you if you're a Christian.
[01:38:03.550 --> 01:38:05.291]  You better not preach to anybody.
[01:38:06.432 --> 01:38:07.452]  Or it's over for you.
[01:38:08.733 --> 01:38:09.313]  It's a problem.
[01:38:11.094 --> 01:38:14.135]  But it's really bad in Saudi Arabia, so that's where I stand on that.
[01:38:14.810 --> 01:38:19.012]  And yeah, some Muslims are incredible haters, just like some Christians are.
[01:38:19.072 --> 01:38:19.973]  They're not really Christians.
[01:38:20.633 --> 01:38:27.337]  And just like there are sects of... Look, I have nothing against Louis Farrakhan.
[01:38:27.357 --> 01:38:38.003]  He says a lot of things that are true about the New World Order, and global government, and the AIDS virus, and areas they go in, you know, they do clean things up, and they have a good message of being upright and family values.
[01:38:38.706 --> 01:38:41.669]  Yeah, it's better than, you know, the CIA doing crack in those neighborhoods.
[01:38:41.749 --> 01:38:53.241]  But, I've got Kaleem Muhammad and I've got older tapes of, because he used to be on TV every week here in Austin, I'm talking 15 years ago, of Louis Farrakhan saying we're all white devils.
[01:38:54.582 --> 01:38:59.507]  And, uh, one time I was sitting there at a restaurant outside,
[01:39:02.605 --> 01:39:08.049]  You know the hamburger joint out on the porch and I was going, you know man I forgot my sunglasses and it's hard for me to open my eyes out here.
[01:39:08.069 --> 01:39:09.550]  I got such light sensitive eyes.
[01:39:10.691 --> 01:39:14.133]  I was like, you know I can almost see in the dark, which is really true.
[01:39:14.153 --> 01:39:15.414]  I mean most people can't.
[01:39:15.434 --> 01:39:17.436]  I mean I have a very low level of light.
[01:39:17.476 --> 01:39:20.898]  It's just an attribute.
[01:39:22.219 --> 01:39:26.903]  But then this black guy walks by and he goes, that's because you're a blue eyed devil and a devil can see in the dark.
[01:39:28.829 --> 01:39:32.511]  But that doesn't make me dislike all black people because, you know, people have said that to me.
[01:39:34.492 --> 01:39:46.018]  Or, you know, because growing up as a kid in Dallas, many times I had groups of blacks, you know, get out of here, you bleepin' honky, blah blah blah, you know, I don't, uh... The same thing goes for the Muslims or any other group.
[01:39:46.879 --> 01:39:51.581]  Uh, you know, just because they got bad people in their groups doesn't mean that, you know, they're inherently all a bunch of killers.
[01:39:52.662 --> 01:39:53.322]  Uh, but, uh...
[01:39:54.318 --> 01:39:55.879]  That's basically it.
[01:39:55.899 --> 01:39:56.979]  Let's talk to David.
[01:39:57.019 --> 01:39:58.560]  David, where are you calling me from?
[01:39:59.321 --> 01:40:00.101]  Lansing, Michigan.
[01:40:00.261 --> 01:40:00.761]  Welcome, sir.
[01:40:00.981 --> 01:40:01.382]  Thank you.
[01:40:01.882 --> 01:40:12.147]  I just wanted to tell you something, or something I want to get into that relates to what you were talking about earlier in a big way, but I have to tell you that when you were on George Norrie, what was it, a couple of weeks ago?
[01:40:12.767 --> 01:40:13.088]  Yes, sir.
[01:40:13.428 --> 01:40:19.091]  A friend of mine who lives in New York City, actually Long Island, I shouldn't say that, but he was
[01:40:20.379 --> 01:40:22.240]  Telling me that you weren't on there.
[01:40:23.261 --> 01:40:26.884]  W.A.B.C., you were on everywhere else.
[01:40:26.924 --> 01:40:28.665]  He got you from a station in Connecticut.
[01:40:29.385 --> 01:40:32.488]  But W.A.B.C., I believe, normally carries George Norrie.
[01:40:32.648 --> 01:40:41.154]  And on that particular night, instead of hearing you, they got to hear an infomercial on how to have really healthy bowel movements.
[01:40:41.254 --> 01:40:41.894]  I'm not kidding.
[01:40:41.974 --> 01:40:47.198]  He actually played this for me on the phone while you were on, George Norrie, and I was listening to you here.
[01:40:48.638 --> 01:40:52.882]  I don't think that's a conspiracy theory, but I'll check into it.
[01:40:53.482 --> 01:41:01.009]  Sometimes on a Friday night show, stations will, overnight, run an infomercial.
[01:41:01.790 --> 01:41:04.092]  Yeah, well, I don't know, I just thought it was kind of interesting.
[01:41:04.132 --> 01:41:08.116]  I mean, you were on everywhere else, but not in New York City, and this is what they replaced you with.
[01:41:09.502 --> 01:41:12.263]  You know, it seems kind of like a coincidence to me anyway.
[01:41:13.104 --> 01:41:30.293]  But what I wanted to tell you is that I'm a ham radio operator and we were involved in a discussion the other night on what's being done, the things that are being done in the wake of 9-11 and how there was all this prior knowledge and a lot of other things.
[01:41:30.733 --> 01:41:33.455]  And one guy that we kind of regard as an insider,
[01:41:35.225 --> 01:41:36.105]  Larry Silverstein
[01:41:57.990 --> 01:41:58.671]  Manhattan.
[01:41:59.411 --> 01:42:06.898]  Yeah, the thing in the Chicago Tribune was a, quote, secretive group of New York real estate moguls headed by Larry Silverstein.
[01:42:07.478 --> 01:42:07.698]  Right.
[01:42:08.259 --> 01:42:11.161]  Well, there's another little interesting tidbit here.
[01:42:11.762 --> 01:42:21.570]  It was kind of chilling, and it said appraisals of the Sears Tower fluctuated wildly since the terrorist attacks suggested the building the tallest in the United States could be a future target.
[01:42:22.110 --> 01:42:23.592]  Before September 11, 2001, an appraisal
[01:42:25.862 --> 01:42:27.103]  Listed its value at $911,000,000.
[01:42:27.744 --> 01:42:31.827]  This was before September 11, 2001.
[01:42:33.388 --> 01:42:34.509]  $911,000,000, but that was reduced to $826,000,000.
[01:42:34.709 --> 01:42:37.251]  Yeah, I've seen that article.
[01:42:37.551 --> 01:42:38.912]  They're being very cute, aren't they?
[01:42:39.813 --> 01:42:44.297]  Well, people wouldn't think that was cute and wouldn't understand that unless we added this.
[01:42:45.358 --> 01:42:47.219]  One year after 9-11, the Chicago
[01:42:51.619 --> 01:42:55.062]  Mercantile on 9-11, the one-year anniversary, came up 9-11.0000.
[01:42:55.562 --> 01:42:57.264]  Thank you.
[01:42:58.124 --> 01:43:06.531]  The New York lottery, not the Illinois lottery, not the Texas lottery, not the Florida lottery, the New York lottery came up 9-1-1, but it gets worse.
[01:43:07.732 --> 01:43:13.156]  We then have just countless other examples of stuff like this going on.
[01:43:13.476 --> 01:43:15.138]  The Madrid bombing
[01:43:16.307 --> 01:43:23.689]  It was on 3-11, 911 days after 9-11, and I literally could go on for 30 minutes with these things.
[01:43:23.729 --> 01:43:25.129]  I was hoping you would tell me.
[01:43:25.149 --> 01:43:25.729]  I've got to let you go.
[01:43:25.769 --> 01:43:26.669]  I've got to play this clip, sir.
[01:43:27.190 --> 01:43:28.490]  I appreciate it.
[01:43:28.650 --> 01:43:31.851]  Before we go back to your calls, I want to play this clip.
[01:43:31.871 --> 01:43:37.752]  This is from some of the clips from the upcoming film, Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State.
[01:43:37.772 --> 01:43:38.472]  It's not out yet.
[01:43:39.132 --> 01:43:40.293]  It'll be out early next month.
[01:43:40.313 --> 01:43:42.093]  It'll be on the website by the end of this month.
[01:43:43.318 --> 01:43:45.959]  That is for the subscribers of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:48.680]  But, uh, and you'll hear a pause here.
[01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:57.143]  That's because in the video it pauses and shows a close-up of a Washington Times article where David Gergen said, I didn't run around naked like the rest of them.
[01:43:57.163 --> 01:43:59.124]  You can watch that at InfoWars.com.
[01:43:59.164 --> 01:44:00.525]  So, here is that clip.
[01:44:00.545 --> 01:44:01.165]  We'll be right back.
[01:44:02.476 --> 01:44:03.317]  One last question.
[01:44:03.877 --> 01:44:13.625]  I read a Washington Times article many years ago where you had a comment about the organization, and then now it's been in the Wall Street Journal, it's been in a lot of different newspapers, and that's the Bohemian Grove.
[01:44:14.046 --> 01:44:24.074]  And back in, what was it, 1996 when you joined as a Clinton advisor, the Republicans were criticizing you, oh, what about Bohemian Grove?
[01:44:24.874 --> 01:44:27.476]  And then you countered them by saying, hey, I don't run around in the woods naked.
[01:44:27.516 --> 01:44:27.957]  What did that mean?
[01:44:35.050 --> 01:44:37.412]  I don't know what quote you're referring to.
[01:44:37.432 --> 01:44:38.773]  I'm not aware of any quote like that.
[01:44:39.574 --> 01:44:45.098]  Listen, I am a happy member of the Bohemian Grove.
[01:44:45.118 --> 01:44:46.780]  I like the folks who come there.
[01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:53.005]  And it's really inappropriate for me to talk about a group beyond that.
[01:44:53.065 --> 01:44:53.486]  Thank you.
[01:44:53.686 --> 01:44:56.128]  Have you been there for the ceremony with the cremation of Cher?
[01:44:57.695 --> 01:45:05.660]  Frankly, I don't think that's something I need to talk to you about.
[01:45:16.008 --> 01:45:18.570]  Have you been there for the ceremony with the cremation of Cher?
[01:45:20.071 --> 01:45:23.013]  Frankly, I don't think that's something I need to talk to you about.
[01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:23.960]  Really?
[01:45:23.980 --> 01:45:24.541]  That's right.
[01:45:24.561 --> 01:45:26.742]  Well, I'm Alex Jones and I snuck in there in 2000.
[01:45:27.563 --> 01:45:29.704]  I'm the guy that blew it wide open and got the video.
[01:45:29.764 --> 01:45:31.045]  It's been on national TV.
[01:45:31.105 --> 01:45:32.826]  Well, I disrespect you for that.
[01:45:32.866 --> 01:45:33.247]  You do?
[01:45:33.347 --> 01:45:33.647]  I do.
[01:45:34.067 --> 01:45:35.968]  There's a lot of big public officials going in there.
[01:45:36.108 --> 01:45:37.049]  You took me to serving up?
[01:45:37.089 --> 01:45:40.371]  I don't know anything about you and I don't know anything about yourself.
[01:45:40.431 --> 01:45:41.632]  I'll tell you what we'll do.
[01:45:41.672 --> 01:45:42.673]  Go ahead and hit pause there.
[01:45:42.693 --> 01:45:45.795]  We're going to come back in the next segment and play the rest of that.
[01:45:45.815 --> 01:45:48.497]  Because what happens is, I was sitting here earlier thinking
[01:45:49.375 --> 01:45:52.656]  You know, on George Norris' show, I played that Bohemian Grove clip.
[01:45:52.796 --> 01:45:54.797]  I had, you know, a CD right off the video.
[01:45:55.197 --> 01:45:56.517]  Real high quality and stereo.
[01:45:56.537 --> 01:45:59.098]  And I was sitting there thinking today, you know, I don't have that clip with me.
[01:45:59.118 --> 01:46:02.379]  I'll just tell them at the network up in Minnesota, I'm in Austin, to grab that.
[01:46:03.119 --> 01:46:06.560]  And I don't know what's going on with that clip, but there's some kind of weird noise over it.
[01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:08.561]  And that's bizarre.
[01:46:08.581 --> 01:46:09.461]  That's off my website.
[01:46:09.481 --> 01:46:11.002]  I watched that clip on the website.
[01:46:11.022 --> 01:46:11.602]  That's not there.
[01:46:12.402 --> 01:46:15.703]  So I'll try to figure that out, and we'll... I don't know what I'll do.
[01:46:15.783 --> 01:46:18.704]  I'll have somebody drive over to this office with the CD.
[01:46:19.716 --> 01:46:21.217]  And maybe I'll play it directly from here.
[01:46:21.817 --> 01:46:22.157]  I don't know.
[01:46:22.237 --> 01:46:24.898]  I should have listened to the clip beforehand.
[01:46:25.498 --> 01:46:26.978]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[01:46:27.239 --> 01:46:28.019]  I've watched it before.
[01:46:28.039 --> 01:46:28.639]  It doesn't have that.
[01:46:28.659 --> 01:46:31.520]  Kind of like that... thing over.
[01:46:31.580 --> 01:46:32.220]  It was music.
[01:46:32.260 --> 01:46:33.801]  That was strange.
[01:46:34.121 --> 01:46:38.983]  Also in the clip, I superimposed some of the clips from my film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:46:40.123 --> 01:46:42.384]  Let's go ahead and talk to Clayton in Rhode Island.
[01:46:42.444 --> 01:46:43.324]  Clayton, you're on the air.
[01:46:43.384 --> 01:46:43.764]  Go ahead.
[01:46:44.284 --> 01:46:44.865]  Hey, Alex.
[01:46:45.045 --> 01:46:46.725]  This is a kite flyer in Rhode Island.
[01:46:47.665 --> 01:46:49.086]  I didn't understand that last statement.
[01:46:49.534 --> 01:46:50.475]  Oh, the Kite Flyer?
[01:46:50.775 --> 01:46:52.096]  Okay, well I don't know what that means.
[01:46:52.176 --> 01:46:54.498]  Oh, ask Jack Blood when you see him.
[01:46:54.538 --> 01:46:55.679]  He'll tell you the whole story.
[01:46:55.739 --> 01:46:59.903]  But anyways, you took the words right out of my mouth when you were talking about that I.D.
[01:46:59.943 --> 01:47:01.244]  chip with these kids, you know?
[01:47:02.064 --> 01:47:09.411]  Invite the kids, the classmates over for ice cream and cake, and you know, have a chip burning party.
[01:47:09.811 --> 01:47:13.354]  You know, I mean, these people are going to be defeated one way or the other.
[01:47:15.325 --> 01:47:17.467]  Well, they're putting this stuff down our throats.
[01:47:17.547 --> 01:47:18.928]  It isn't doing anything for us.
[01:47:18.948 --> 01:47:23.010]  This federal ID card he told me about last week, I've been telling everyone about it.
[01:47:23.491 --> 01:47:25.992]  And they're just in shock all around me.
[01:47:26.032 --> 01:47:27.614]  They're just like, you gotta be kidding me.
[01:47:27.714 --> 01:47:28.254]  I says, nope.
[01:47:29.835 --> 01:47:33.277]  So, doing a good job and that clip was very fine.
[01:47:33.337 --> 01:47:33.998]  I enjoyed that.
[01:47:35.689 --> 01:47:37.430]  Did you hear the music over the background?
[01:47:37.450 --> 01:47:38.131]  Yeah, I did.
[01:47:38.371 --> 01:47:43.916]  You know, son, I wanted to comment on... Well, that's Twilight Zone, because that's not the clip I put on my website.
[01:47:44.296 --> 01:47:52.702]  Right, you did a heavy station on 990, 9.990, and it's really beating up up here in Rhode Island.
[01:47:53.123 --> 01:47:58.347]  And that ham radio operator that calls, if any ham radio operators call and they're having discussions, why don't they
[01:47:58.888 --> 01:48:02.570]  Tell them what frequency they're on because a lot of people will listen in.
[01:48:02.590 --> 01:48:03.451]  No, I'm confused.
[01:48:03.511 --> 01:48:06.913]  You're talking about 990, hand radio operators?
[01:48:06.953 --> 01:48:09.675]  No, the 990 is on the shortwave broadcast.
[01:48:09.735 --> 01:48:12.857]  It's stepping on your station down below.
[01:48:13.658 --> 01:48:15.999]  Oh, because we simulcast on shortwave somebody else's.
[01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:19.182]  Alright, well complain about it to the FCC for me.
[01:48:19.462 --> 01:48:19.922]  Very good.
[01:48:19.982 --> 01:48:20.823]  You take care, Alec.
[01:48:21.103 --> 01:48:21.623]  Alright, sir.
[01:48:21.663 --> 01:48:22.724]  Good to hear from you.
[01:48:22.744 --> 01:48:24.105]  I'm sorry I was dense a few times.
[01:48:24.125 --> 01:48:26.546]  You were saying kite flyer and then stuff.
[01:48:26.607 --> 01:48:27.707]  I just didn't understand.
[01:48:27.787 --> 01:48:28.628]  I apologize.
[01:48:29.615 --> 01:48:38.137]  Some of the other news I want to get into is this new AIDS virus, HIV virus, that supposedly causes AIDS.
[01:48:38.697 --> 01:48:57.181]  AIDS viruses isolated from two individuals are being studied to determine whether either might be the source of a rare and potentially more aggressive form of HIV detected in a New York City man, an AIDS scientist involved in the studies said Sunday.
[01:48:58.214 --> 01:49:05.339]  Many more tests need to be conducted to determine if the strains from the three people are the same, said the scientist Dr. David Ho.
[01:49:06.300 --> 01:49:15.066]  He directs the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in Manhattan, which is conducting some of the studies in collaboration with the New York City Health Department.
[01:49:16.427 --> 01:49:18.029]  And by the way, the evidence shows the U.S.
[01:49:18.069 --> 01:49:21.051]  government, through the health department in New York City,
[01:49:21.924 --> 01:49:30.648]  Uh, in the late 70s, uh, through hepatitis inoculations that they encouraged the gay men to take, uh, put this in the vaccine.
[01:49:30.688 --> 01:49:31.168]  So, hmm.
[01:49:31.788 --> 01:49:34.989]  While some findings may be available in a week, others will take longer.
[01:49:35.490 --> 01:49:46.154]  But even if the strains prove to be the same, it doesn't necessarily mean that the super virus is on the loose because there could be genetic factors in the first man, uh, that would make the infections progress faster.
[01:49:47.463 --> 01:49:51.084]  And we'll come back with details of this and a lot more on the other side.
[01:49:51.104 --> 01:49:51.584]  Stay with us.
[01:49:55.624 --> 01:49:57.125]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:57.325 --> 01:50:00.405]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:50:00.545 --> 01:50:04.446]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:04.486 --> 01:50:08.727]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:50:09.067 --> 01:50:12.828]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:12.968 --> 01:50:14.768]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:15.348 --> 01:50:18.269]  Police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[01:50:18.309 --> 01:50:23.031]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:23.191 --> 01:50:26.232]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:26.412 --> 01:50:29.273]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:29.773 --> 01:50:35.895]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:36.415 --> 01:50:40.218]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[01:50:40.619 --> 01:50:42.000]  Order your video today.
[01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:43.381]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.

[01:50:55.077 --> 01:50:56.678]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:50:56.818 --> 01:51:00.920]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:51:01.061 --> 01:51:03.942]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:51:04.022 --> 01:51:10.746]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:51:10.906 --> 01:51:13.928]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:51:14.128 --> 01:51:16.529]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:51:16.650 --> 01:51:24.374]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[01:51:24.454 --> 01:51:25.094]  We're good to go!

[01:52:55.963 --> 01:53:07.932]  Manuel in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[01:53:07.992 --> 01:53:08.572]  Go ahead.
[01:53:08.592 --> 01:53:09.833]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:53:09.973 --> 01:53:10.374]  Good, sir.
[01:53:10.954 --> 01:53:11.334]  Okay.
[01:53:11.635 --> 01:53:14.417]  Well, I wanted to talk about symbolism and the language of symbols.
[01:53:14.437 --> 01:53:24.524]  You know, here in this Western culture, the globalists, with a direct intent, have made it so that we don't recognize symbols, although they bury us under them.
[01:53:25.208 --> 01:53:34.912]  And I'm sure you're aware of the fact of the different federal notes, the denominations of the money, having the Twin Towers and the Pentagon burning, the explosions.
[01:53:35.253 --> 01:53:38.114]  Well, all of the new notes, when you fold them, it shows the
[01:53:38.757 --> 01:53:54.567]  From a plane's first hit, how the smoke progressed, then the towers collapsing, shows the Pentagon, I mean, and for folks that don't understand this, the globalists communicate with us through the money, the all-seeing eye, the owl, the cobwebs, the 3-2-2, it's on the money.
[01:53:55.007 --> 01:53:56.148]  Well, that's an interface.
[01:53:56.388 --> 01:53:58.970]  Whether the people understand it or not, that's a subconscious interface.
[01:53:59.990 --> 01:54:03.893]  Well, you understand that one of the denominations is actually the Hoover Dam.
[01:54:05.011 --> 01:54:06.912]  There's this Goldeneye video game.
[01:54:07.232 --> 01:54:09.974]  They've always been late for New World Order.
[01:54:09.994 --> 01:54:10.695]  Propaganda.
[01:54:10.935 --> 01:54:13.897]  Well now, you're evil in this new Goldeneye game.
[01:54:13.937 --> 01:54:19.421]  And the last one is actually a stage where you're walking in a factory in what they call a security operation.
[01:54:19.901 --> 01:54:23.283]  And a voice comes over the speaker, and I'm telling you this so you can see the credibility.
[01:54:24.024 --> 01:54:25.885]  They drop science, as we say in our little slang.
[01:54:26.565 --> 01:54:30.828]  You're walking through the factory and a voice comes through the speaker and says, we're merging the global economies.
[01:54:30.868 --> 01:54:31.929]  We're breaking down borders.
[01:54:31.989 --> 01:54:34.651]  We're going to control it with a conglomerate of corporations.
[01:54:35.327 --> 01:54:39.648]  In the new GoldenEye now, one of the stages is set in the Hoover Dam.
[01:54:40.648 --> 01:54:46.989]  Your mission and your direct objective is to set off a seismic bomb within the Hoover Dam to destroy it.
[01:54:47.709 --> 01:54:52.990]  To quote, get the desired effect and set in motion, a set desire of objective.
[01:54:53.690 --> 01:54:59.371]  Now I thought that's very interesting because... And the objective is to then, you're the government that brings in martial law.
[01:54:59.411 --> 01:55:02.592]  The game Deus Ex, the first version of it, a new one's out now.
[01:55:03.701 --> 01:55:04.862]  I played this on TV.
[01:55:04.882 --> 01:55:06.702]  It's video, folks.
[01:55:06.762 --> 01:55:07.643]  Video games are video.
[01:55:07.703 --> 01:55:10.144]  It's high quality, made right here in Austin.
[01:55:10.544 --> 01:55:11.404]  You're the government.
[01:55:11.444 --> 01:55:14.326]  You carry out a bio-attack to bring in martial law.
[01:55:14.486 --> 01:55:15.386]  Oh, this guy's government.
[01:55:15.746 --> 01:55:17.127]  He's playing both sides.
[01:55:17.367 --> 01:55:18.567]  This guy's doing the same thing.
[01:55:19.368 --> 01:55:20.988]  And that's exactly what's going on in this game.
[01:55:21.028 --> 01:55:25.350]  They also speak about international monetary units.
[01:55:25.450 --> 01:55:27.891]  Well, it's like the show 24, finally.
[01:55:27.911 --> 01:55:30.833]  It was going to be the militia with the Muslims blowing up L.A.
[01:55:30.853 --> 01:55:31.333]  with a nuke.
[01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:33.682]  And when you finally find out, it was the government.
[01:55:34.222 --> 01:55:35.123]  Well, it's all interlaced.
[01:55:35.303 --> 01:55:44.071]  When you see symbols on TV, on the money, in the video games, people need to wake up and... Almost every major corporation is a pyramid with an all-seeing eye.
[01:55:44.432 --> 01:55:45.232]  And it's no mistake.
[01:55:46.233 --> 01:55:46.714]  No mistake.
[01:55:46.874 --> 01:55:47.514]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[01:55:47.975 --> 01:55:48.936]  Yeah, I appreciate the call.
[01:55:48.976 --> 01:55:50.417]  That's a really good point, Manuel.
[01:55:50.817 --> 01:55:55.882]  Before I end this hour, and we are going to get that clip, I call my web guy and I'm like, is there music on that clip now?
[01:55:55.902 --> 01:55:56.783]  And he's like, yeah, and I'm like,
[01:55:57.846 --> 01:56:00.808]  It sounds good, but I think it's in a way distracting on radio.
[01:56:00.868 --> 01:56:01.868]  It's not with the video.
[01:56:02.368 --> 01:56:06.390]  So I'm going to download it again without the added music.
[01:56:07.351 --> 01:56:08.751]  And we'll play that in the next hour.
[01:56:08.771 --> 01:56:10.072]  I was going, am I hearing music?
[01:56:10.412 --> 01:56:11.953]  Am I going crazy?
[01:56:12.033 --> 01:56:12.873]  Is there music on this?
[01:56:13.193 --> 01:56:16.335]  A few weeks ago I watched the clip online again and it didn't have it.
[01:56:16.375 --> 01:56:18.336]  I was going, we just download this from the same spot.
[01:56:18.856 --> 01:56:21.037]  But I guess he did it to kind of sweeten it.
[01:56:21.377 --> 01:56:22.418]  He's a great video editor.
[01:56:23.444 --> 01:56:25.145]  I don't know, over radio it might be distracting.
[01:56:25.165 --> 01:56:27.646]  So we're going to play that early in the next hour.
[01:56:29.207 --> 01:56:32.569]  And we've got a guest coming on as well, Mothers Against the Draft.
[01:56:32.589 --> 01:56:33.550]  You don't want to miss that.
[01:56:34.350 --> 01:56:41.675]  In the last minute I've got here before this hour ends, go to InfoWars.com or PresidentPlanet.com.
[01:56:41.695 --> 01:56:44.777]  Look at all the great videos and books there in the bookstore we offer.
[01:56:44.817 --> 01:56:48.479]  The books on tape, the ProGun t-shirts, all of it.
[01:56:48.659 --> 01:56:49.679]  InfoWars.com.
[01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:50.900]  Bumper stickers at cost.
[01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:52.141]  You just pay for the shipping.
[01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:57.853]  Go to the website, order the videos, get the bumper stickers, get the materials, wake people up, warn them.
[01:56:58.473 --> 01:57:02.575]  The total free number to call and order the videos, if you want to order via the phone, is 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[01:57:02.595 --> 01:57:04.076]  Or as I said, InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:57:04.136 --> 01:57:07.418]  You can go order via the safe, secure online shopping carts.
[01:57:19.059 --> 01:57:23.244]  So, InfoWars.com or AAA253139.
[01:57:23.404 --> 01:57:26.387]  And your purchase also supports this broadcast and makes it possible.
[01:57:26.647 --> 01:57:28.529]  That's a secondary but important reason to do it.
[01:57:28.849 --> 01:57:30.331]  And don't forget PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:57:30.511 --> 01:57:31.752]  Read the books, watch all the films.
[01:57:32.273 --> 01:57:35.436]  Right there online for 15 cents a day, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:57:35.897 --> 01:57:39.200]  Third hour, a great guest, more of your calls and a ton of news.
[01:57:39.741 --> 01:57:41.342]  Straight ahead in 70 seconds.
[01:57:52.034 --> 01:57:56.218]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:56.879 --> 01:57:57.720]  You want answers?
[01:57:58.460 --> 01:57:59.301]  Well, so does he.
[01:58:00.022 --> 01:58:03.846]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:04.206 --> 01:58:08.270]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:23.587 --> 01:58:24.368]  Alright, folks.
[01:58:24.428 --> 01:58:29.932]  Coming up in the next segment, we're going to be talking to the head of Mothers Against the Draft.
[01:58:29.972 --> 01:58:34.215]  And if you don't know what Drenap is coming, it's really already been set up in many capacities.
[01:58:34.655 --> 01:58:37.758]  You're going to find out the details coming up in the next segment.
[01:58:38.198 --> 01:58:46.324]  And we'll continue with your phone calls throughout this final hour on this Valentine's Day or night edition, depending on what time zone you're listening to us in.
[01:58:47.483 --> 01:58:52.887]  Or tomorrow in some time zones, and in some places and times, in some rebroadcast.
[01:58:53.588 --> 01:58:57.471]  But the toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:57.491 --> 01:59:14.765]  A really interesting story is that CNN's nuke plant photos over the weekend, they showed what was supposedly an image of Iran's nuclear plants that could produce nuclear weapons.
[01:59:15.746 --> 01:59:16.066]  But then it
[01:59:17.276 --> 01:59:20.018]  Those eyes out there, we have great people that notice these things.
[01:59:20.618 --> 01:59:22.819]  CNN's trying to decide how to deal with this right now.
[01:59:24.260 --> 01:59:30.243]  Notice that then when they talked about North Korea and their nuclear arsenal, they showed the exact same supposed satellite photo.
[01:59:32.925 --> 01:59:37.988]  So, more manufacturing, more manipulation going on.
[01:59:38.548 --> 01:59:40.369]  And right now, report details U.S.
[01:59:40.449 --> 01:59:41.950]  spy flights over Iran.
[01:59:44.230 --> 01:59:55.460]  A published report to the United States, of course, has special forces in the country, and has been flying drones over Iran for almost a year looking for evidence of nuclear weapons programs and to detect weaknesses in air defenses.
[01:59:55.981 --> 01:59:59.384]  Uh, yeah, they're flying over to detect weaknesses in air defenses, folks.
[01:59:59.404 --> 02:00:08.912]  There are literally, literally, hundreds and hundreds of inspectors that, I mean, no one's more open than Iran in the country.
[02:00:08.932 --> 02:00:10.494]  They can go anywhere, anytime,
[02:00:11.860 --> 02:00:16.904]  When you hear the word nuclear, yes, nuclear reactors are being built that are the peaceful type.
[02:00:17.284 --> 02:00:25.190]  And even if they were building the types that could produce the enriched uranium or plutonium, we're talking about four years before they even have a bomb.
[02:00:26.551 --> 02:00:28.412]  They don't even have the delivery system, folks.
[02:00:28.692 --> 02:00:37.339]  But then our government, under Bill Clinton and then Lord Bush, did nothing to stop Khan Laboratories from developing nuclear weapons.
[02:00:38.266 --> 02:00:41.628]  Hydrogen weapons, and then giving it to North Korea.
[02:00:41.688 --> 02:00:44.449]  So, real threats are no big deal.
[02:00:45.430 --> 02:00:49.592]  China and Russia, two articles today, how they're spying on us at record levels.
[02:00:49.932 --> 02:00:52.934]  They're in the bioweapons manufacturing labs of the U.S.
[02:00:53.174 --> 02:00:54.095]  They're bragging about it.
[02:00:54.495 --> 02:00:55.515]  That's not a problem.
[02:00:56.476 --> 02:01:02.079]  But we've got to invade Iran, and we've got to go out and send Homeland Security to Puffer Belly Toys in St.
[02:01:02.119 --> 02:01:02.759]  Helen, Oregon.
[02:01:02.779 --> 02:01:05.801]  You know, a little 2,000 square foot toy shop that was selling
[02:01:06.716 --> 02:01:11.997]  Magic Cubes, knock-offs of Rubik's Cubes, because they're an infrastructure protection and this may be terrorism.
[02:01:12.577 --> 02:01:19.419]  Or a veteran calls and complains too much and Homeland Security says, well, he didn't threaten anybody, but he called the VA too much, so we're arresting him.
[02:01:19.839 --> 02:01:20.719]  I've got to get him back on.
[02:01:20.739 --> 02:01:23.599]  He was facing trial last time I talked to that doctor.
[02:01:25.540 --> 02:01:31.921]  So, you're a military doctor, you get out, you want some treatment, and what you get is arrested.
[02:01:32.341 --> 02:01:34.542]  Homeland Security, I mean, it's a joke.
[02:01:34.582 --> 02:01:35.662]  The borders are wide open,
[02:01:36.511 --> 02:01:41.015]  But meanwhile they're telling us to give up all of our liberties and that we'll get security.
[02:01:41.055 --> 02:01:42.976]  You give up liberty, folks, you get despotism.
[02:01:42.996 --> 02:01:43.877]  You get enslavement.
[02:01:44.177 --> 02:01:45.298]  You get the T-Word.
[02:01:45.579 --> 02:01:46.940]  I'm not talking about the T-Rex.
[02:01:48.041 --> 02:01:54.846]  I'm talking about tyranny, my friends, and it's just unbelievable to face this.
[02:01:55.467 --> 02:02:01.312]  Just a small little info blurb or, oh, what do they call those?
[02:02:01.532 --> 02:02:03.774]  A little bite of trivia.
[02:02:04.154 --> 02:02:04.774]  Factoid!
[02:02:04.854 --> 02:02:05.435]  Factoid!
[02:02:06.434 --> 02:02:09.415]  Doing research on Schwarzenegger as I finish up Marshall Lobb.
[02:02:09.755 --> 02:02:10.555]  Film I'm working on.
[02:02:12.116 --> 02:02:13.436]  Folks, the guy's into art.
[02:02:15.437 --> 02:02:20.198]  And I found some really scary stuff he's into about a month ago that I haven't really talked about on air.
[02:02:21.318 --> 02:02:31.681]  But I found something... I found something this weekend that blew me away.
[02:02:32.902 --> 02:02:34.342]  It's a sculpture of his mother.
[02:02:35.365 --> 02:02:37.406]  He had paid for, and a sculpture of himself.
[02:02:39.087 --> 02:02:42.509]  I'll tell you the detail when we get back.
[02:02:42.529 --> 02:02:46.952]  Stay with me.
[02:02:47.433 --> 02:02:51.775]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:51.935 --> 02:02:56.378]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:56.518 --> 02:03:00.901]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:03:00.941 --> 02:03:02.302]  The New World Order.
[02:03:03.082 --> 02:03:04.023]  Panama.
[02:03:04.063 --> 02:03:08.306]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:08.347 --> 02:03:15.292]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:15.412 --> 02:03:17.494]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:17.674 --> 02:03:28.162]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:28.423 --> 02:03:31.185]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new
[02:03:31.405 --> 02:03:31.665]  That's 888-253-3139
[02:03:46.989 --> 02:03:47.769]  Terrorism.
[02:03:47.909 --> 02:03:48.650]  Terrorism.
[02:03:48.770 --> 02:03:49.610]  Chemical attacks.
[02:03:49.670 --> 02:03:50.331]  Dirty bombs.
[02:03:50.431 --> 02:03:50.831]  Fallout.
[02:03:50.931 --> 02:03:51.911]  Biological attack.
[02:03:52.111 --> 02:03:52.632]  Anthrax.
[02:03:52.712 --> 02:03:54.833]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[02:03:55.073 --> 02:03:56.674]  Alarming words for our time.
[02:03:56.914 --> 02:03:59.395]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:03:59.775 --> 02:04:14.362]  The video, Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:14.402 --> 02:04:14.722]  government.
[02:04:14.882 --> 02:04:16.683]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:04:17.063 --> 02:04:22.965]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:04:23.125 --> 02:04:27.587]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.
[02:04:27.867 --> 02:04:33.208]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:33.348 --> 02:04:34.569]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:04:34.649 --> 02:04:35.169]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:35.229 --> 02:04:37.270]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[02:04:46.514 --> 02:04:48.876]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:04:49.136 --> 02:04:52.979]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[02:04:53.299 --> 02:04:54.100]  Read the labels.
[02:04:54.540 --> 02:04:58.663]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:04:58.883 --> 02:05:03.066]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:05:03.446 --> 02:05:08.330]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:05:08.710 --> 02:05:12.292]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:05:12.472 --> 02:05:17.814]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:05:18.094 --> 02:05:20.835]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:05:21.115 --> 02:05:22.015]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:05:22.316 --> 02:05:28.058]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.

[02:05:47.287 --> 02:05:52.330]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:52.730 --> 02:05:54.971]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:06:00.442 --> 02:06:02.844]  Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m.
[02:06:02.864 --> 02:06:03.645]  until 2 p.m.
[02:06:04.265 --> 02:06:06.567]  Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight.
[02:06:07.128 --> 02:06:17.676]  Thank you for joining us, and your calls are coming up a bunch of other news, and I will air that clip before I confront David Gergen about the Bohemian Grove Skull and Bones at the RNC.
[02:06:17.716 --> 02:06:20.359]  I've never aired it here on my own show yet, and it's an upcoming film.
[02:06:21.199 --> 02:06:29.146]  But we're joined by Janine Hanson, and she's with Mothers Against the Draft.
[02:06:30.055 --> 02:06:32.296]  And Janine, it's great to have you on with us today.
[02:06:32.676 --> 02:06:33.416]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:06:34.096 --> 02:06:36.557]  Just appreciated many of your videos.
[02:06:37.018 --> 02:06:37.558]  Oh, really?
[02:06:37.778 --> 02:06:37.998]  Yes.
[02:06:38.298 --> 02:06:38.998]  I didn't know that.
[02:06:39.859 --> 02:06:41.119]  What a small world.
[02:06:42.039 --> 02:06:51.863]  Well, I was instrumental here in Nevada in getting definitions into our terrorism legislation that would protect free speech and even the right to
[02:06:53.246 --> 02:06:54.906]  To protest the government, essentially.
[02:06:54.926 --> 02:07:00.747]  And you're the executive director of the group that's trying to get Nevada full statehood.
[02:07:00.767 --> 02:07:01.488]  Tell folks about that.
[02:07:02.108 --> 02:07:09.689]  Yes, the Nevada Committee for Full Statehood works on property rights and protecting the rights of ranchers, particularly.
[02:07:10.249 --> 02:07:19.811]  In Nevada, we have 87% of our land that's controlled by the federal government, and they put out of business half of our ranches, and they confiscate cattle without
[02:07:21.115 --> 02:07:22.776]  Due process or a court hearing.
[02:07:22.816 --> 02:07:23.997]  So we worked very hard on that.
[02:07:24.017 --> 02:07:26.619]  And they arrest people who, you know, it's bad.
[02:07:28.080 --> 02:07:30.242]  I guess 80 plus percent isn't enough for them.
[02:07:32.363 --> 02:07:39.488]  Well, you know, ranchers run a lot of cattle on that and they have surface rights like water and other things and we've been trying to protect that.
[02:07:39.548 --> 02:07:44.492]  In fact, there's a bill up in our legislature this time that would require a court order.
[02:07:44.532 --> 02:07:46.373]  You would think we have due process of law.
[02:07:46.413 --> 02:07:49.595]  We don't, of course, under any of the bureaucracies like the IRS or
[02:07:50.808 --> 02:07:52.889]  Or the Bureau of Land Management here in Nevada.
[02:07:53.449 --> 02:08:01.912]  Did you hear about the federal court ruling a week ago that the IRS cannot take your property without a court order?
[02:08:02.572 --> 02:08:03.192]  Yes, I did.
[02:08:03.412 --> 02:08:07.334]  That's encouraging, that the courts will still protect our constitutional rights.
[02:08:07.774 --> 02:08:08.734]  Every once in a while?
[02:08:09.515 --> 02:08:09.595]  Yeah.
[02:08:09.615 --> 02:08:18.998]  Because they had a Supreme Court ruling, what, three years ago, three and a half years ago, that there's a, it was in a Nevada case, about they don't have to give people just compensation.
[02:08:20.208 --> 02:08:23.929]  Well, there's a court case on that in Nevada, which should be ruled on.
[02:08:23.989 --> 02:08:37.352]  It's been in the courts for 10 years with Wayne Hage, and he's won all the way to get reimbursed for the takings that the federal government, when they took his cattle and precluded him from using his rights on the land.
[02:08:37.852 --> 02:08:39.032]  So that should be interesting.
[02:08:39.052 --> 02:08:39.572]  He's won.
[02:08:39.652 --> 02:08:47.574]  It's a trifurcated case, and he's won the first two, and they're only now waiting to see what his damages will be from the federal government.
[02:08:48.061 --> 02:08:54.223]  Janine, we've got links to the sites at InfoWars.com, but why don't you tell folks about your websites?
[02:08:55.003 --> 02:08:58.604]  We have a, our new website is Mothers Against the Draft.
[02:08:58.664 --> 02:09:03.705]  We've, a lot of us women who are concerned about this have united from across the country.
[02:09:04.245 --> 02:09:06.926]  The website is just MothersAgainstTheDraft.org.
[02:09:07.886 --> 02:09:16.288]  Our immediate focus is to put out a survey to our congressmen, because of course Congress has to pass the draft.
[02:09:16.889 --> 02:09:18.390]  and find out where they stand.
[02:09:18.690 --> 02:09:21.432]  We will next week have these surveys available.
[02:09:21.492 --> 02:09:33.799]  People can send them in to their own congressmen, take them in in their own districts or their senators and ask them where they stand on the military draft, mandatory national service,
[02:09:34.592 --> 02:09:36.613]  Yes, we're going to be publishing all of those results.
[02:09:53.260 --> 02:09:56.846]  On the website so people will know where their congressman stands.
[02:09:56.866 --> 02:09:57.967]  So you mean business?
[02:09:58.528 --> 02:10:01.532]  And I know about your fine committee up there, full state of it.
[02:10:01.573 --> 02:10:05.278]  You guys are really busy and I'm honored that you've seen my videos.
[02:10:06.239 --> 02:10:08.523]  I'm glad that somebody gave you a copy or something.
[02:10:09.207 --> 02:10:11.988]  Well, you used to be on the radio here in Reno, Nevada.
[02:10:12.488 --> 02:10:13.128]  Oh, that's right.
[02:10:13.148 --> 02:10:14.208]  I remember when I was stationed in Seoul.
[02:10:14.228 --> 02:10:19.449]  And I found out about him, and we have a lot of active people that are interested in these issues, and so I was able to view them.
[02:10:19.469 --> 02:10:19.849]  That's right.
[02:10:19.869 --> 02:10:20.930]  That was many years ago.
[02:10:20.970 --> 02:10:22.850]  I've been helping stir folks up for a while.
[02:10:23.450 --> 02:10:23.970]  That's great.
[02:10:24.250 --> 02:10:24.950]  I forgot about that.
[02:10:24.970 --> 02:10:28.511]  Well, I'm glad you're out there, and that's just really exciting, Janine.
[02:10:28.911 --> 02:10:31.072]  Janine, tell me about
[02:10:33.331 --> 02:10:39.675]  I mean, for those that just joined us, they've introduced the bills, they've got National Compulsory Service, Bill Clinton and George Bush Sr.
[02:10:39.755 --> 02:10:51.763]  on TV talking about it, they've got Secure Corps, AmeriCorps, they've already got troops that have already served years, they're saying you can't leave, you're basically our slaves, as one congressman called it, you know, indentured servants.
[02:10:52.083 --> 02:10:58.407]  This is really being set up, the draft boards are being set back up, but the news says you're a conspiracy theorist if you talk about it.
[02:10:59.299 --> 02:11:05.204]  Exactly, but you have to do as Congressman Ron Paul suggests, and that is look at their actions and not at their words.
[02:11:05.764 --> 02:11:09.287]  We see that the Selective Service System is being put in place.
[02:11:09.867 --> 02:11:12.850]  We hear them already talking about possibly drafting women.
[02:11:13.310 --> 02:11:21.116]  We hear a special needs draft in terms of doctors and... By the way, the draft for women is in S89.
[02:11:21.276 --> 02:11:23.058]  But go ahead.
[02:11:23.898 --> 02:11:25.379]  Exactly, this is what I'm saying.
[02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:27.241]  All of the components that are there
[02:11:27.987 --> 02:11:33.208]  Uh, right now, uh, we see that they are getting, they're low in, uh, computer areas and linguistics.
[02:11:33.268 --> 02:11:35.589]  These will probably be the first people to be drafted.
[02:11:36.249 --> 02:11:39.530]  I think all it will take, we're trying to have a first strike, Alex.
[02:11:39.590 --> 02:11:44.251]  We're going to have a first strike in advance of them implementing this draft.
[02:11:44.371 --> 02:11:45.912]  A preemptive strike!
[02:11:45.932 --> 02:11:51.253]  A preemptive strike, and that's what we want to do because we want to prevent our children from being forced
[02:11:53.188 --> 02:11:55.869]  They claim they're going to free other people.
[02:11:56.289 --> 02:12:01.071]  People who are forced to fight for freedom are not free.
[02:12:01.151 --> 02:12:03.071]  Our children sent abroad are not free.
[02:12:03.911 --> 02:12:06.352]  And we're in 130 countries now.
[02:12:07.272 --> 02:12:15.895]  We know that they have 40% of our military in Iraq in these areas is National Guard and Reserve.
[02:12:16.334 --> 02:12:24.300]  We don't have the military here in the United States now to do what we know is constitutionally important, and that is to protect and defend America.
[02:12:24.981 --> 02:12:27.403]  And so we see that they're drawing on these reserves.
[02:12:27.483 --> 02:12:30.686]  It makes me nervous that we are not well protected here.
[02:12:30.706 --> 02:12:33.488]  I apologize, but you're the opposite, which is great.
[02:12:33.908 --> 02:12:35.209]  Normally I have to say, speak up.
[02:12:35.289 --> 02:12:36.330]  Back off your phone a bit.
[02:12:36.750 --> 02:12:37.531]  Okay, I'll do that.
[02:12:37.731 --> 02:12:37.931]  Good.
[02:12:38.292 --> 02:12:39.152]  You're too powerful.
[02:12:40.373 --> 02:12:40.914]  That sounds great.
[02:12:40.934 --> 02:12:42.615]  That's what happens with throwing up with four boys.
[02:12:42.655 --> 02:12:43.556]  You've got to be assertive.
[02:12:43.736 --> 02:12:44.116]  I know.
[02:12:44.236 --> 02:12:44.797]  Is that better?
[02:12:45.379 --> 02:12:45.659]  Yes.
[02:12:46.060 --> 02:12:46.440]  Thank you.
[02:12:47.861 --> 02:12:59.008]  Anyway, we are concerned that all the signs tell us that they're moving towards a draft because they don't have enough people to fill these responsibilities and fill all these commitments that we have made.
[02:12:59.549 --> 02:13:07.374]  And so perhaps if there's some kind of an international incident, be it in North Korea or the Mideast or somewhere else,
[02:13:08.041 --> 02:13:12.544]  Then they will have a reason to say, well, we don't have enough manpower.
[02:13:12.564 --> 02:13:12.924]  That's it.
[02:13:12.964 --> 02:13:14.405]  It's going to come out of a crisis.
[02:13:14.465 --> 02:13:16.907]  It's going to come out of a terror attack or something like that.
[02:13:17.267 --> 02:13:19.148]  Well, that seems very likely, Alex, to me.
[02:13:20.009 --> 02:13:20.729]  And that's what we want to do.
[02:13:20.749 --> 02:13:23.411]  Because they've got it all lined up, all ready to go.
[02:13:23.711 --> 02:13:26.953]  The bill's set up, getting it all ready, setting up the draft boards.
[02:13:27.434 --> 02:13:28.394]  All this is happening.
[02:13:28.695 --> 02:13:33.678]  They can't even get... People are not signing up to the guard because they know you're a slave.
[02:13:33.718 --> 02:13:35.479]  Another is saying two to four years in Iraq.
[02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:43.105]  I think that's a pretty good assessment and we're very concerned about that because we see all of our children and our grandchildren
[02:14:03.174 --> 02:14:08.396]  When they talk about a generational war, that this will be their future.
[02:14:09.016 --> 02:14:12.837]  And we need to protect our American future here in America.
[02:14:13.277 --> 02:14:14.818]  We need to protect our children.
[02:14:15.158 --> 02:14:16.738]  And that's why we've gotten involved.
[02:14:16.958 --> 02:14:23.380]  And we would like to encourage people to go to our website to sign the petition, to sign up to receive our weekly alerts.
[02:14:23.820 --> 02:14:26.581]  We'll be having simple projects that anybody can do.
[02:14:26.701 --> 02:14:29.342]  Call your congressman, everybody on the same day in one month.
[02:14:29.963 --> 02:14:34.906]  You know, one of the things about Congress is they don't see the light until they feel the heat.
[02:14:35.507 --> 02:14:39.049]  And we want to create a little heat so that they know in advance...
[02:14:40.104 --> 02:14:46.549]  Uh... that there is opposition to the draft so that they don't... so that it isn't easy to pass if it comes to that.
[02:14:46.869 --> 02:14:49.031]  And we're talking about a different draft than the past.
[02:14:49.071 --> 02:14:53.734]  This isn't just going to be with these lotteries and grabbing some of our men.
[02:14:54.135 --> 02:14:55.356]  Some of the bills are 18 to 49.
[02:14:55.396 --> 02:14:56.496]  Some of the others are 18 to 36, 18 to 41.
[02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:09.562]  They've already got technical drafts, which they admit are ready to go, for doctors and lawyers and EMT technicians, ambulance technicians.
[02:15:10.002 --> 02:15:15.564]  I mean, folks, there's 12 different draft bills I've seen in the last two years, and this is real.
[02:15:15.624 --> 02:15:16.524]  This is happening.
[02:15:17.124 --> 02:15:21.386]  And after some city gets lit up like a candle, unfortunately, which they're probably going to do,
[02:15:23.314 --> 02:15:28.018]  You're going to see this happen, so we've got to form the resistance to this now.
[02:15:29.439 --> 02:15:33.702]  I mean, look, even if there isn't some new event, they've got to have a draft.
[02:15:33.722 --> 02:15:35.123]  They just don't have the troops, Janine.
[02:15:35.764 --> 02:15:44.210]  That's right, and I feel that one of the things that Charles Rangel wanted to do, he's one of the ones that has the most recent bill on the draft.
[02:15:44.991 --> 02:15:47.653]  He said, until everybody's child is involved in this,
[02:15:48.075 --> 02:15:52.300]  They're not going to care, so we have to have a broad draft with no exemptions.
[02:15:52.340 --> 02:15:54.001]  We know the draft will never be fair.
[02:15:54.562 --> 02:15:56.404]  A broad draft with no exemptions... Yeah, let's send the bus cars!
[02:15:56.424 --> 02:16:04.573]  We're going to change the foreign policy, but frankly, I think we need to act preemptively before that happens and not depend on that changing anything.
[02:16:05.416 --> 02:16:07.537]  Now, we already have a draft.
[02:16:07.577 --> 02:16:14.839]  People who've served 10, 15, 20 years are being told, hey, sorry, you're going back and we're not letting you out.
[02:16:15.319 --> 02:16:16.299]  That's exactly right.
[02:16:16.379 --> 02:16:17.760]  That's precisely what's happening now.
[02:16:17.780 --> 02:16:18.600]  And they were not told.
[02:16:18.660 --> 02:16:19.560]  They were not told this.
[02:16:19.580 --> 02:16:21.501]  This is not just a federal ruling.
[02:16:21.561 --> 02:16:25.442]  They said, well, you can do this, but it's still a fraud.
[02:16:25.842 --> 02:16:28.023]  It does not say in the paperwork that you're a slave.
[02:16:29.036 --> 02:16:37.705]  Well, and besides that, Alex, the real purpose of the Reserves and the National Guard is to be a last resort to defend America.
[02:16:38.205 --> 02:16:40.508]  When they're overseas, that leaves us vulnerable.
[02:16:40.528 --> 02:16:42.510]  You know, peace through strength.
[02:16:42.550 --> 02:16:46.033]  If we don't have strength here at home, then we are more vulnerable than ever.
[02:16:46.554 --> 02:16:50.798]  And if we're using those Reserves and the Guard units overseas,
[02:16:51.388 --> 02:17:02.419]  We become more and more vulnerable, so even our children and our whole nation, which individuals may not be drafted, become subject to military tyranny if we have no one to defend us here.
[02:17:04.101 --> 02:17:13.671]  So I think that's an important issue we need to think about, that we have reserves, we have a guard for a particular reason, and it isn't to be overseas.
[02:17:14.284 --> 02:17:16.745]  Supposedly working for somebody else's freedom.
[02:17:17.165 --> 02:17:25.868]  Well, they have roughly doubled the recruiting money, the billboards, the TV ads, the print ads, that get poor disadvantaged people to go sign up for this.
[02:17:26.388 --> 02:17:35.812]  My main reason against the draft, well I'll tell people my biggest reason for being against the draft, other than it's just basic indentured servitude, when we get back with our guest Janine Hanson,
[02:17:36.764 --> 02:17:38.686]  And you need to go check out their website.
[02:17:38.706 --> 02:17:41.308]  We'll tell you that website when we get back as well.
[02:17:41.448 --> 02:17:42.749]  And we'll take some calls.
[02:17:43.229 --> 02:17:44.710]  So everybody, stay with us.
[02:17:44.810 --> 02:17:45.551]  We shall return.

[02:19:48.743 --> 02:19:53.245]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:19:53.585 --> 02:19:57.687]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:19:57.987 --> 02:19:58.527]  We listened.
[02:19:58.827 --> 02:20:03.810]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:20:04.090 --> 02:20:04.590]  We listened.
[02:20:04.970 --> 02:20:07.991]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:20:08.432 --> 02:20:08.952]  We listened.
[02:20:09.412 --> 02:20:13.493]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:20:13.853 --> 02:20:14.353]  We listened.
[02:20:14.693 --> 02:20:19.934]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:20:20.334 --> 02:20:21.694]  Again, we listened.

[02:20:47.147 --> 02:20:54.093]  Many people have wondered what has happened to the once great United States of America, why the moral decay that has been taking place within it.
[02:20:55.354 --> 02:20:59.417]  The United States has been targeted for overthrow for world government.
[02:21:00.138 --> 02:21:07.164]  The United Nations has been established to redistribute the wealth of the world away from the United States, Great Britain, and Western Europe.
[02:21:08.050 --> 02:21:16.816]  You need to know, as a specific individual citizen of the United States of America, why these things are happening and what you can do about it.

[02:21:50.631 --> 02:21:53.513]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:53.533 --> 02:21:58.537]  All right, here's my other reasons for being against the draft.
[02:22:00.430 --> 02:22:04.932]  Number one, this war was never declared by Congress, which makes it totally illegal.
[02:22:05.433 --> 02:22:07.974]  I know, I'm an old-fashioned stickler for the Constitution.
[02:22:07.994 --> 02:22:09.135]  Stuff like that.
[02:22:09.155 --> 02:22:13.497]  Then on top of it, they're using depleted uranium.
[02:22:13.857 --> 02:22:19.620]  They've used it all over the major cities of Iraq, in the old bases of Saddam's, where our troops then moved in.
[02:22:19.861 --> 02:22:20.561]  Very deadly.
[02:22:21.321 --> 02:22:29.266]  And they're giving them all these experimental vaccines, and then once they sign up for a two, three, four-year stint, even voluntarily they're keeping them in.
[02:22:31.274 --> 02:22:32.094]  It's unbelievable.
[02:22:32.175 --> 02:22:37.419]  Continuing with Janine Hanson, then we're going to go to Tim and Bill and Dave and Lance and others.
[02:22:38.500 --> 02:22:45.325]  There's massive resistance to a draft, but then still so many people are in denial as the preparations are made.
[02:22:46.126 --> 02:22:48.288]  How are you fighting this and what do you see developing?
[02:22:48.508 --> 02:22:49.529]  Well, it's interesting.
[02:22:49.549 --> 02:22:51.530]  You know, I've been called everything this weekend.
[02:22:51.590 --> 02:22:54.633]  I never had any association with like a communist.
[02:22:55.103 --> 02:23:00.505]  That was an interesting experience because of course in communist countries everybody is subject to the draft.
[02:23:01.025 --> 02:23:02.266]  And we're working for freedom.
[02:23:02.306 --> 02:23:08.949]  But I think one of the biggest problems with people is that if they support President Bush, they feel like we're attacking him.
[02:23:09.009 --> 02:23:11.130]  We're not even focusing on the presidency.
[02:23:11.170 --> 02:23:12.770]  We're focusing on Congress.
[02:23:13.510 --> 02:23:16.832]  That's where the real power is to whether or not to call a draft is.
[02:23:16.892 --> 02:23:19.613]  And we think that congressmen should be accountable
[02:23:20.157 --> 02:23:21.698]  And I think people can relate to that.
[02:23:50.607 --> 02:23:55.448]  You don't need a majority to make a difference, although the majority of the American people do oppose the draft.
[02:23:55.788 --> 02:23:59.529]  You just need a vocal minority, and that's what we are putting together now.
[02:23:59.549 --> 02:24:01.730]  Let me just say this for people that just joined us.
[02:24:01.750 --> 02:24:03.991]  You may want to believe the lies about the war.
[02:24:04.011 --> 02:24:05.651]  You may want to still buy the propaganda.
[02:24:06.331 --> 02:24:08.312]  Is it worth losing your children?
[02:24:08.372 --> 02:24:10.572]  Is it worth getting their arms and legs blown off?
[02:24:11.073 --> 02:24:12.653]  You know, twice this weekend,
[02:24:14.145 --> 02:24:19.548]  At two different stores, a guy that helped me buy a hard drive had both his legs blown off.
[02:24:19.588 --> 02:24:26.892]  And I just said, he had the high and tight haircut, had about a thousand yards fair, and I hadn't seen him there at this computer shop that I frequent.
[02:24:27.892 --> 02:24:30.793]  And I said, did you just get back from Iraq?
[02:24:30.833 --> 02:24:31.574]  And he said, yeah, I did.
[02:24:32.205 --> 02:24:35.487]  And he said, you know, improvised explosive device.
[02:24:35.527 --> 02:24:39.089]  He was in one of these Humvees, blew up under it, blew his legs off.
[02:24:39.810 --> 02:24:46.694]  And then I saw another individual at a grocery store, young guy, high and tight, with his arm cut off at the shoulder.
[02:24:46.974 --> 02:24:49.055]  And I just walked up and I said, you just came back from Iraq?
[02:24:49.075 --> 02:24:49.716]  And he said, yeah.
[02:24:50.176 --> 02:24:56.380]  I mean, boy, it must be bad if I've seen two amputees, one a double amputee, in the last 48 hours.
[02:24:56.960 --> 02:25:03.365]  Well, the fact of the matter is that it's just a terrible tragedy that our troops have been sent there without proper equipment.
[02:25:03.405 --> 02:25:05.226]  There is really no excuse for that.
[02:25:06.647 --> 02:25:12.191]  Whatever you think about the war, you should not send people there who are not well able to defend themselves.
[02:25:12.731 --> 02:25:14.133]  And this is a real tragedy.
[02:25:14.173 --> 02:25:17.495]  The other tragedy is that they have essentially lied to our veterans.
[02:25:17.555 --> 02:25:21.538]  They should, if they have served there with honor, they should
[02:25:22.092 --> 02:25:23.753]  Uh, receive those things that they need.
[02:25:23.813 --> 02:25:26.315]  Many people don't even want to join the military.
[02:25:26.335 --> 02:25:34.700]  You could have other people joining because they see that they're at a disadvantage because the government lies to what they're going to actually do for the veterans.
[02:25:35.040 --> 02:25:39.103]  When they get their arms and legs blown off and they fly them to Rammstein,
[02:25:40.311 --> 02:25:42.913]  Uh, they make them pay for their own plane ticket back.
[02:25:43.353 --> 02:25:44.654]  Yeah, it's unbelievable.
[02:25:44.774 --> 02:25:45.935]  Oh, you lost your leg!
[02:25:45.975 --> 02:25:47.016]  So we're gonna make you pay!
[02:25:47.416 --> 02:25:49.697]  We're so cheap, we're gonna discharge you right here!
[02:25:50.278 --> 02:25:59.464]  Now, you pay for a hotel until you get your money to fly out of here, and the families on food stamps, they have to do local drives, money drives, to get money to fly them back.
[02:25:59.844 --> 02:26:01.345]  That's mainstream news, by the way.
[02:26:01.565 --> 02:26:09.871]  There was some good movement, I think, I believe in New Mexico, about providing some additional life insurance for our soldiers.
[02:26:10.471 --> 02:26:16.477]  We can't expect people to do this if we don't respect the fact that they have been willing to do it.
[02:26:16.797 --> 02:26:22.322]  But beyond that, I think that it's very important that we protect our children from this.
[02:26:22.863 --> 02:26:25.925]  I mean, 130 countries out, where does it end?
[02:26:25.945 --> 02:26:29.288]  That's two-thirds of the nations of the world that we're in right now.
[02:26:29.889 --> 02:26:33.812]  If something were to happen in North Korea... Especially more than that, there's only 190 nations.
[02:26:34.493 --> 02:26:35.594]  Well, it's 130 we're in.
[02:26:37.347 --> 02:26:42.070]  So, you can see how broadly we are spread.
[02:26:42.310 --> 02:26:45.452]  And the neocons say they want to go into 60 more countries.
[02:26:47.233 --> 02:26:54.297]  You know, there's a lot of arrogance about all of this, that we would seem to impose our kind of government on other people.
[02:26:55.057 --> 02:27:00.440]  A lot of us have concerns about what's going on right here, as you have mentioned, Alex,
[02:27:01.027 --> 02:27:05.834]  And I think it's important that... You know, there's one member of Congress who has a son in the Marine Corps.
[02:27:06.115 --> 02:27:10.622]  How about they pass a law to draft all their children and all the CEO's children?
[02:27:10.962 --> 02:27:12.745]  Well, you know, Alex, that'll never happen.
[02:27:12.865 --> 02:27:13.746]  It'll only be ours.
[02:27:15.672 --> 02:27:16.653]  Well, they got another way.
[02:27:16.713 --> 02:27:20.315]  If they keep crashing the economy like it is, it's the only job you'll be able to have.
[02:27:22.936 --> 02:27:26.378]  Well, I'm sorry to laugh, but I'm afraid I feel like that's probably true.
[02:27:26.498 --> 02:27:28.219]  I tell you what, stay there.
[02:27:28.239 --> 02:27:28.900]  We're going to come back.
[02:27:28.920 --> 02:27:30.261]  We're going to take some calls.
[02:27:30.281 --> 02:27:31.301]  Talk a little bit more with you.
[02:27:31.681 --> 02:27:34.183]  And I've got this audio clip coming up as well.
[02:27:34.203 --> 02:27:36.164]  Stay with us.
[02:27:37.945 --> 02:27:38.866]  We're on the march.
[02:27:39.346 --> 02:27:40.987]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:41.867 --> 02:27:44.549]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.558 --> 02:27:51.780]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the words you use.
[02:27:52.521 --> 02:28:00.785]  In business and socially, your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.
[02:28:01.386 --> 02:28:03.127]  That's why you need Verbal Advantage.
[02:28:03.827 --> 02:28:09.810]  While you listen, Verbal Advantage will give you the confidence that comes with a strong command of the English language.
[02:28:10.431 --> 02:28:11.991]  No more fumbling for the right word.
[02:28:12.532 --> 02:28:14.673]  No more embarrassment at how to express yourself.
[02:28:15.265 --> 02:28:17.286]  No more fear of using the wrong word.
[02:28:17.846 --> 02:28:18.946]  And it's so easy.
[02:28:19.667 --> 02:28:21.707]  To learn, you simply listen.
[02:28:22.508 --> 02:28:23.148]  When you want.
[02:28:23.648 --> 02:28:24.308]  Where you want.
[02:28:25.128 --> 02:28:30.150]  See why over 100,000 people have already gotten the verbal advantage they need for success.
[02:28:30.990 --> 02:28:33.811]  To learn more about verbal advantage, call now.
[02:28:33.831 --> 02:28:34.592]  1-800-419-WORD.
[02:28:34.612 --> 02:28:35.072]  That's 419-WORD.
[02:28:35.092 --> 02:28:35.232]  1-800-419-WORD.
[02:28:47.648 --> 02:28:52.871]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:28:53.011 --> 02:29:01.096]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:29:01.357 --> 02:29:08.401]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:29:08.601 --> 02:29:09.882]  Radioactive poisoning.
[02:29:09.943 --> 02:29:15.869]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:29:16.029 --> 02:29:21.135]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:29:21.255 --> 02:29:30.085]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:29:30.145 --> 02:29:31.206]  Thanks for watching.
[02:29:49.395 --> 02:29:54.860]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:55.300 --> 02:29:59.544]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:29:59.764 --> 02:30:06.811]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:07.191 --> 02:30:13.297]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:13.437 --> 02:30:14.658]  There are no side effects.
[02:30:14.978 --> 02:30:17.942]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:30:18.082 --> 02:30:20.124]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:30:20.425 --> 02:30:27.673]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:30:27.954 --> 02:30:31.378]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[02:30:31.758 --> 02:30:34.920]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[02:30:34.940 --> 02:30:35.020]  866-885-6625.
[02:30:35.040 --> 02:30:35.240]  866-885-6625.
[02:30:35.261 --> 02:30:36.201]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:30:36.221 --> 02:30:36.421]  Call today.
[02:30:53.127 --> 02:31:01.695]  Alright, that David Gergen clip is coming up here in a few minutes, but I want to get through some of your calls, and I'm sure whatever issue you're bringing up, it'll tie back into this growing police state.
[02:31:01.735 --> 02:31:04.197]  Look, if it's a free country, folks, you don't have a draft.
[02:31:04.637 --> 02:31:14.026]  Nazi Germany had one, Communist Russia had one, China has one, and yeah, back when I was exposing Bill Clinton, I was an evil extremist right-winger.
[02:31:14.685 --> 02:31:20.011]  Now that I'm exposing the policies of the same old corrupt government run by the same people, I'm a hardcore commie.
[02:31:20.031 --> 02:31:20.292]  No, no.
[02:31:20.732 --> 02:31:21.794]  I'm a freedom lover.
[02:31:22.034 --> 02:31:23.496]  I'm a constitutionalist.
[02:31:24.016 --> 02:31:25.378]  I'm an American.
[02:31:27.054 --> 02:31:29.777]  And the America we all love is being dismantled.
[02:31:30.677 --> 02:31:35.442]  Janine Hanson, who heads up Mothers Against the Draft, give folks that website again.
[02:31:35.962 --> 02:31:38.224]  It's mothersagainstthedraft.org.
[02:31:38.644 --> 02:31:40.926]  And it's a great website, a lot of key information.
[02:31:40.966 --> 02:31:41.787]  Let's take a few calls.
[02:31:42.167 --> 02:31:44.109]  Tim in Ohio, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:31:44.309 --> 02:31:44.950]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:31:45.370 --> 02:31:45.670]  Hello.
[02:31:45.831 --> 02:31:46.271]  Hello, Janine.
[02:31:46.571 --> 02:31:46.972]  Hello.
[02:31:47.232 --> 02:31:48.733]  Bless you for all your work that you're doing.
[02:31:48.993 --> 02:31:49.314]  Thank you.
[02:31:49.334 --> 02:31:52.577]  And my question is sort of two-fold, and I'll address it to both of you.
[02:31:53.097 --> 02:31:54.178]  As we progress,
[02:31:54.991 --> 02:32:11.057]  Towards these non-constitutional things, the draft, the ID card, what do you think the level of resistance is going to be and how do you believe that level of resistance will be affected by another globalist attack?
[02:32:12.907 --> 02:32:18.530]  Yeah, a suitcase nuke goes off, or they, you know, blow up something in London.
[02:32:20.231 --> 02:32:24.013]  Oh my gosh, the enemy has attacked, or there's some other war in another country.
[02:32:24.113 --> 02:32:27.975]  Iran invades Iraq after Israel blows up their reactors.
[02:32:28.756 --> 02:32:30.837]  If that happens, Janine, what do you see happening?
[02:32:31.157 --> 02:32:39.482]  Well, that's a serious problem, and I think we'll have a much more difficult time opposing these unconstitutional programs, just as we got the Patriot Act after 9-11.
[02:32:40.526 --> 02:32:48.710]  That's why we need to work in advance of these things to inform people as to the realities and to get their support and the pressure on the congressman.
[02:32:49.170 --> 02:33:07.798]  I think if we have one of those occur it will be far more difficult for us to be successful in protecting our children from the draft and so that's why it's so important for us to have a preemptive strike on this, for us to move forward in educating people and to let people know they aren't alone and to put that heat on the congressman
[02:33:08.286 --> 02:33:09.808]  It's essential that we do that now.
[02:33:09.928 --> 02:33:11.910]  If we wait till then, it will be too late.
[02:33:12.191 --> 02:33:14.914]  Well, also, you know, it's not just the depleted uranium.
[02:33:15.815 --> 02:33:19.820]  It's not just the experimental vaccines, which are illegal to give them, but they still do it.
[02:33:20.340 --> 02:33:23.063]  It's other stuff, like, Iraq gets cold during the winter.
[02:33:23.083 --> 02:33:24.165]  I mean, you know, freezing.
[02:33:24.725 --> 02:33:32.169]  And I've talked to the troops, it's been on the news, they're in their tanks freezing in just hot weather gear.
[02:33:32.189 --> 02:33:34.571]  I mean, it's just basic stuff.
[02:33:34.611 --> 02:33:36.812]  The military does not care about them.
[02:33:37.212 --> 02:33:41.315]  They make them fly themselves back from Germany with their legs blown off, folks!
[02:33:41.495 --> 02:33:52.021]  I recently read an article where they're saying that even some of the soldiers are using their microwave transmitters as the sit-on to keep warm out there in the desert, which can of course cause more brain
[02:33:52.823 --> 02:33:58.387]  Malfunctioning, as well as creating certain diseases and tumors within the eyes, the ears, and the brain.
[02:33:58.888 --> 02:34:07.694]  Well, we know even in the mainstream press, it's been reported that families are sending things over there that their boys and their girls need.
[02:34:07.814 --> 02:34:12.197]  I think that it's a tragedy that we have not supplied our troops in the way they need to be.
[02:34:12.217 --> 02:34:18.842]  There have been whole units in the Army and the Marine Corps that have been refusing to fight because, literally, their machine guns don't work.
[02:34:19.758 --> 02:34:24.327]  Well, we're upwards of $200 billion for this war, and what, the $2.4 billion missing from the Pentagon?
[02:34:24.528 --> 02:34:25.750]  Could you please post that again, Alex?
[02:34:25.790 --> 02:34:26.853]  I've looked for it and I can't find it.
[02:34:27.236 --> 02:34:28.977]  About the 2.4 missing from the Pentagon?
[02:34:28.997 --> 02:34:33.381]  Yeah, CBS News, just type in CBS News, trillions missing from the Pentagon.
[02:34:33.641 --> 02:34:35.663]  Where is all this money going?
[02:34:35.683 --> 02:34:38.265]  Is it just lying in the pockets of all the defense contractors?
[02:34:38.305 --> 02:34:43.829]  Well, the defense budget is only $450 a year, plus extra emergency funding, it's $507 a year.
[02:34:44.130 --> 02:34:48.934]  But the point is, is that those were slush funds they had, they've now sucked dry.
[02:34:49.314 --> 02:34:50.195]  So, thanks for the call.
[02:34:50.435 --> 02:34:51.135]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:34:51.155 --> 02:34:51.916]  You bet.
[02:34:52.016 --> 02:34:53.317]  Bill, in Wisconsin.
[02:34:53.337 --> 02:34:54.118]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:34:56.243 --> 02:34:58.946]  Thanks Alex and Janine, you're doing good work.
[02:34:59.407 --> 02:34:59.827]  Thank you.
[02:35:00.107 --> 02:35:12.101]  I have a point that I want to bring up and you might have covered it earlier Alex, but did you notice that financial building in Madrid that burned over the weekend?
[02:35:13.484 --> 02:35:14.525]  Well, yeah, I've talked about it.
[02:35:14.565 --> 02:35:17.387]  It burned for almost two days and didn't collapse.
[02:35:17.607 --> 02:35:17.947]  Right.
[02:35:17.967 --> 02:35:19.829]  And they kept saying, oh, it'll probably collapse.
[02:35:19.849 --> 02:35:23.031]  No steel building, modern one, it never collapsed until 9-11.
[02:35:23.331 --> 02:35:28.996]  This one didn't burn, and it's fires, again, white flame shooting a hundred feet in the air, folks, and it didn't collapse.
[02:35:29.176 --> 02:35:29.436]  Right.
[02:35:29.816 --> 02:35:29.996]  Right.
[02:35:30.177 --> 02:35:31.678]  Okay, I didn't know if you covered it.
[02:35:32.218 --> 02:35:39.023]  The other thing yesterday on Meet the Press, Buchanan versus Nathan Cheransky.
[02:35:39.764 --> 02:35:40.684]  Cheransky is
[02:35:41.934 --> 02:35:45.597]  A member of the Israeli Parliament, former Soviet dissident.
[02:35:45.617 --> 02:35:48.039]  So it was not Alexander Sholts and Nietzsche that was on?
[02:35:48.239 --> 02:35:48.659]  No, no.
[02:35:48.979 --> 02:35:49.640]  That's what I thought.
[02:35:49.680 --> 02:35:52.602]  The caller thought that I'm like, Sholts and Nietzsche's for the war?
[02:35:52.622 --> 02:35:53.263]  No, no.
[02:35:53.723 --> 02:35:54.584]  I didn't think that was the case.
[02:35:54.604 --> 02:35:54.704]  No, no.
[02:35:54.724 --> 02:35:58.547]  Sharansky's written a book, a neocon book, promoting this
[02:35:59.580 --> 02:36:04.264]  Yeah, Taranski's the British professor who's the big communist.
[02:36:04.664 --> 02:36:04.905]  Right.
[02:36:05.245 --> 02:36:06.486]  Oh yeah, I read about that last week.
[02:36:06.526 --> 02:36:10.589]  Oh yeah, the new darling of the neocons is a guy who wants world communism, yeah.
[02:36:10.810 --> 02:36:11.050]  Right.
[02:36:11.130 --> 02:36:13.692]  But if you're against the communists, you're a communist.
[02:36:14.253 --> 02:36:16.514]  Okay, so anyway, you ought to check that clip.
[02:36:17.015 --> 02:36:18.136]  And then one other thing.
[02:36:18.156 --> 02:36:19.077]  Well, where is that clip?
[02:36:19.297 --> 02:36:23.160]  Well, it would be on Meet the Press, the last half of the show.
[02:36:23.580 --> 02:36:24.201]  Okay.
[02:36:24.381 --> 02:36:27.744]  And Buchanan really, you know, how he runs hot and cold.
[02:36:28.240 --> 02:36:29.660]  Well, he was hot yesterday.
[02:36:30.320 --> 02:36:31.861]  So, anyway, the last thing.
[02:36:31.941 --> 02:36:33.141]  I got Greg Pallas.
[02:36:33.961 --> 02:36:36.402]  I got his Bush family fortune.
[02:36:37.062 --> 02:36:40.843]  And next time you get him on there, you've got to jump on him.
[02:36:40.943 --> 02:36:52.245]  Because he makes a statement in the DVD there that there's not a shred of evidence that there was prior knowledge by the Bush family of 9-11.
[02:36:52.545 --> 02:36:54.005]  Well, he made that about a year ago.
[02:36:54.025 --> 02:36:55.146]  And Greg's not perfect.
[02:36:55.186 --> 02:36:57.346]  I mean, he's a BBC News presenter.
[02:36:57.930 --> 02:36:58.570]  I understand.
[02:36:58.590 --> 02:37:00.230]  But anyway... No, I will.
[02:37:00.250 --> 02:37:00.851]  I'll jump on him.
[02:37:01.291 --> 02:37:02.331]  He stays away from that, man.
[02:37:02.371 --> 02:37:03.211]  I've talked to him in person.
[02:37:03.231 --> 02:37:07.372]  I've been out to dinner with him, and he's scared to death of it, and I don't know why.
[02:37:07.412 --> 02:37:08.552]  He gets out as much as he can.
[02:37:08.952 --> 02:37:09.712]  Thank you for the call.
[02:37:10.333 --> 02:37:17.714]  Listen, I want to thank you for coming on, Janine, and I want to get you back up as this develops, because the draft is... The bills are introduced.
[02:37:17.754 --> 02:37:18.414]  They're serious.
[02:37:18.434 --> 02:37:19.134]  We've got to stop it.
[02:37:20.014 --> 02:37:20.815]  Thank you very much.
[02:37:20.875 --> 02:37:23.075]  Remember to go to Mothers Against the Draft.
[02:37:23.295 --> 02:37:23.955]  Volunteer.
[02:37:24.095 --> 02:37:24.995]  Sign the petition.
[02:37:25.396 --> 02:37:26.756]  We will be proceeding to
[02:37:28.135 --> 02:37:32.038]  Make an issue with Congress, and you can be a part of making a big difference on this.
[02:37:32.058 --> 02:37:35.161]  So we invite people to help us, and thank you for all you're doing, Alex.
[02:37:35.481 --> 02:37:36.081]  Thanks a million.
[02:37:36.122 --> 02:37:36.662]  God bless.
[02:37:37.062 --> 02:37:37.383]  Thank you.
[02:37:37.403 --> 02:37:46.490]  Yeah, I told my producer last Friday, I said, hey, get these mothers against the draft on, and then we get her on, and she's a listener and has the videos.
[02:37:47.491 --> 02:37:48.992]  Small world, folks.
[02:37:50.395 --> 02:37:53.937]  They're getting a lot of news, a lot of press, getting a lot of good stuff done there.
[02:37:54.697 --> 02:37:57.099]  A few more calls and I want to air this David Gergen clip.
[02:37:57.979 --> 02:37:59.140]  Dave in Kansas City.
[02:37:59.180 --> 02:37:59.981]  Dave, go ahead.
[02:38:00.661 --> 02:38:02.382]  Yeah, Alex, you've got a great show today.
[02:38:02.883 --> 02:38:04.704]  And I'm totally against the draft.
[02:38:05.524 --> 02:38:08.086]  We don't need to grind our children up.
[02:38:08.106 --> 02:38:09.647]  Well, I mean, it's indentured servitude.
[02:38:09.987 --> 02:38:13.610]  And you know, people, if you want to put your kids in a meat grinder, get them to volunteer.
[02:38:14.510 --> 02:38:15.091]  Exactly.
[02:38:15.151 --> 02:38:16.231]  More grist for the mill.
[02:38:17.712 --> 02:38:18.793]  The reason I called is
[02:38:19.622 --> 02:38:24.384]  On your David Gergen tape or clip that you're going to run?
[02:38:24.684 --> 02:38:24.964]  Yes.
[02:38:25.324 --> 02:38:33.848]  I believe that, you know, the top Satanists in this country are nothing but pedophiles.
[02:38:34.268 --> 02:38:39.210]  I mean, you go back to Paul Benassi, Johnny Gosch, they have a story.
[02:38:39.570 --> 02:38:44.192]  There's a story there about Larry King and the Franklin cover-up.
[02:38:45.004 --> 02:38:47.425]  And that's not the Larry King of... Let me talk.
[02:38:47.505 --> 02:38:49.606]  That's not the Larry King of Larry King Alive.
[02:38:49.646 --> 02:38:50.646]  It's a black Larry King.
[02:38:50.786 --> 02:38:51.247]  That's right.
[02:38:51.287 --> 02:38:52.847]  He ran a savings and loan.
[02:38:53.408 --> 02:38:54.368]  And laundered money.
[02:38:55.228 --> 02:38:55.949]  As well as that.
[02:38:56.329 --> 02:38:57.429]  But it's a great show.
[02:38:57.969 --> 02:39:04.192]  And like I said, I believe the top Satanists in this country are nothing but pedophiles.
[02:39:04.672 --> 02:39:06.013]  It's part of their religion.
[02:39:07.033 --> 02:39:10.575]  If you want to check that out in the Bible, go to Joel chapter 2.
[02:39:11.761 --> 02:39:12.442]  Interesting.
[02:39:12.483 --> 02:39:13.404]  Thanks for the call.
[02:39:13.424 --> 02:39:14.947]  Let me be clear about Bohemian Grove.
[02:39:26.762 --> 02:39:34.688]  1,500 members, but then they've got about 500 supernumeraries who aren't full members, but are members in training.
[02:39:34.808 --> 02:39:40.893]  Remember when I had Morgenthaler-Jones, who pushes the Amendment to the Constitution for Arnold, and she said, well, my husband isn't a member yet.
[02:39:41.253 --> 02:39:42.695]  He's a member in training.
[02:39:42.735 --> 02:39:45.577]  And, you know, she's a super-millionaire, you know.
[02:39:45.977 --> 02:39:49.680]  So is her husband, and here she is going, you know, in a big biotech.
[02:39:49.900 --> 02:39:51.262]  He's a member in training.
[02:39:51.302 --> 02:39:52.863]  We'd love to be full members.
[02:39:54.682 --> 02:39:55.362]  So I want to be clear.
[02:39:55.382 --> 02:40:01.345]  Out of the 2,000 people that are members, you know, they're not all hanging out with the male prostitutes.
[02:40:01.385 --> 02:40:03.726]  They're not all hanging out with the gay porn stars.
[02:40:04.786 --> 02:40:07.667]  They're not all part-taking part in the satanic rituals.
[02:40:08.627 --> 02:40:09.988]  This all goes on there.
[02:40:10.148 --> 02:40:13.389]  I was inside for five hours on July 15, 2000.
[02:40:13.549 --> 02:40:22.473]  I filmed Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, has the video of it in the major newspapers, probably a dozen of them, admit I snuck in and got the footage, and the Grove admits I got it.
[02:40:23.248 --> 02:40:25.289]  They just say I have a bad interpretation of all of it.
[02:40:26.630 --> 02:40:36.716]  And in my new film, American Dictators, we go back to Bohemian Grove, back to the gates, talk to the locals, show some clips of it, show the new news stories about the male prostitutes and all that stuff.
[02:40:37.196 --> 02:40:42.018]  So that's about 15 minutes of that new two-hour film to give you an idea of the film's cover so much.
[02:40:43.039 --> 02:40:48.322]  But to be clear, I don't have any evidence of David Gergen involved in anything but being a member there.
[02:40:49.634 --> 02:40:51.836]  And, uh, you know, we have this news article.
[02:40:51.916 --> 02:40:55.659]  I just saw David Gergen walking, getting ready to walk into Madison Square Garden.
[02:40:56.679 --> 02:40:59.561]  And, uh, you can watch the video of this on Infowars.com.
[02:41:00.882 --> 02:41:03.665]  The audio you're about to hear, and I just said, hey guys, crew, get over here.
[02:41:03.845 --> 02:41:07.187]  And we had all our cameras, and I walk over, and I go, Mr. Gergen, can I interview you?
[02:41:08.308 --> 02:41:09.449]  And he said, sure, where's your camera?
[02:41:09.469 --> 02:41:12.551]  I go, it's right there, and so I start interviewing him.
[02:41:12.571 --> 02:41:17.435]  So when he says ambush journalism, I just, ambush would be to say, I'm here to talk to you about, uh,
[02:41:18.436 --> 02:41:22.019]  Hostess Cupcakes, and then I've talked to you about the national debt.
[02:41:22.080 --> 02:41:23.101]  That's ambush journalism.
[02:41:23.121 --> 02:41:24.162]  It wasn't ambush journalism.
[02:41:24.442 --> 02:41:25.142]  He's just right there.
[02:41:25.182 --> 02:41:25.983]  I said, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:41:26.023 --> 02:41:26.864]  I make documentaries.
[02:41:27.325 --> 02:41:28.045]  I'd like to interview you.
[02:41:28.065 --> 02:41:29.086]  That's going to be in the full film.
[02:41:29.386 --> 02:41:31.388]  And there's more to this interview than what you're about to hear.
[02:41:33.550 --> 02:41:35.052]  So I just talked to him for about five minutes.
[02:41:36.914 --> 02:41:37.794]  Actually, about ten minutes.
[02:41:38.655 --> 02:41:40.297]  And he just got real mad.
[02:41:40.937 --> 02:41:43.400]  And I just said, you were in the Washington Times.
[02:41:44.773 --> 02:41:47.376]  And out there in 102 degree heat, I said 1996.
[02:41:48.497 --> 02:41:53.262]  In the film you see the article, it was actually 1993, Washington Times.
[02:41:54.543 --> 02:41:58.687]  When he left the Republicans and went to work for Clinton, they got mad at him.
[02:41:58.707 --> 02:42:01.370]  When you hear this pause in the audio, that's where we show the news article.
[02:42:02.662 --> 02:42:03.603]  You know, with his actual quote.
[02:42:03.723 --> 02:42:05.345]  As I say it, then we cut to the quote.
[02:42:05.825 --> 02:42:09.088]  And the date, you know, I show different shots of the newspaper article.
[02:42:09.608 --> 02:42:11.610]  The original, actual Washington Times article.
[02:42:11.971 --> 02:42:17.556]  I said, Mr. Gergen, one last question after I talked to him about terrorism, the history of terrorism.
[02:42:17.596 --> 02:42:24.642]  I said, you, well you're about to hear the clip, you know, you run around, you said you don't run around naked in the woods like the others.
[02:42:25.363 --> 02:42:26.444]  He said, I don't know anything about that.
[02:42:27.159 --> 02:42:28.679]  And so, here is that clip.
[02:42:28.699 --> 02:42:31.820]  We'll come back, cover some other news, and take some more calls.
[02:42:31.860 --> 02:42:34.041]  But just listen to how he responds to me.
[02:42:34.081 --> 02:42:36.742]  He doesn't say, oh, we don't do that, or oh, whatever.
[02:42:37.142 --> 02:42:39.062]  He says, none of your business.
[02:42:39.323 --> 02:42:39.723]  Here it is.
[02:42:40.843 --> 02:42:42.003]  Okay, one last question.
[02:42:42.563 --> 02:42:52.286]  I read a Washington Times article many years ago where you had a comment about the organization, and then now it's been in the Wall Street Journal, it's been in a lot of different newspapers, and that's the Bohemian Grove.
[02:42:52.726 --> 02:42:53.647]  And back in, what was it, 19, uh,
[02:42:55.467 --> 02:42:57.288]  I don't know what quote you're referring to.
[02:42:57.568 --> 02:42:58.709]  I'm not aware of any quote like that.
[02:43:21.298 --> 02:43:23.740]  I'm a happy member of the Bohemian Grove.
[02:43:23.780 --> 02:43:25.441]  I like the folks who come there.
[02:43:26.061 --> 02:43:31.144]  And it's really inappropriate for me to talk about the group beyond that.
[02:43:31.724 --> 02:43:31.884]  Thanks.
[02:43:32.365 --> 02:43:34.866]  Have you been there for the ceremony with the cremation of care?
[02:43:36.367 --> 02:43:42.711]  Frankly, I don't think that's something I need to talk to you about.
[02:43:42.751 --> 02:43:43.471]  Then we show a clip.
[02:43:54.694 --> 02:43:57.237]  Have you been there for the ceremony with the cremation of Kare?
[02:43:58.718 --> 02:44:01.741]  Frankly, I don't think that's something I need to talk to you about.
[02:44:02.402 --> 02:44:02.662]  Really?
[02:44:02.682 --> 02:44:03.203]  That's right.
[02:44:03.683 --> 02:44:05.605]  Well, I'm Alex Jones and I snuck in there in 2000.
[02:44:06.226 --> 02:44:08.488]  I'm the guy that blew it wide open and got the video.
[02:44:08.528 --> 02:44:09.589]  It's been on national TV.
[02:44:09.789 --> 02:44:11.131]  Well, I disrespect you for that.
[02:44:11.571 --> 02:44:11.851]  You do?
[02:44:12.032 --> 02:44:12.212]  I do.
[02:44:12.711 --> 02:44:15.733]  But there's a lot of big public officials going in there, don't we deserve to know?
[02:44:15.913 --> 02:44:23.276]  I don't know anything about you, and I don't know anything about your film, but if you go in there with an understanding, you've violated that understanding by releasing that film, and I don't respect you for that.
[02:44:23.897 --> 02:44:25.558]  Really?
[02:44:25.678 --> 02:44:29.219]  I'm sorry, you took an understanding when you went in there that you would not do that film.
[02:44:29.380 --> 02:44:30.720]  Did you have an understanding when you went in there?
[02:44:31.160 --> 02:44:31.341]  No.
[02:44:31.561 --> 02:44:32.221]  Did you crash it?
[02:44:32.581 --> 02:44:32.781]  Yes.
[02:44:33.061 --> 02:44:35.283]  Yeah, and it has no trespassing signs there too, doesn't it?
[02:44:35.323 --> 02:44:36.083]  No, they put them up after.
[02:44:36.423 --> 02:44:36.923]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:44:37.023 --> 02:44:37.803]  I'm sorry, sir.
[02:44:37.863 --> 02:44:38.604]  I've been there before.
[02:44:38.664 --> 02:44:42.825]  I know what the circumstances are, and I'm sorry you violated the understandings.
[02:44:43.005 --> 02:44:44.425]  That was not a gentlemanly thing to do.
[02:44:44.445 --> 02:44:45.245]  But what about the ritual?
[02:44:45.285 --> 02:44:46.465]  Is the ritual gentlemanly?
[02:44:54.267 --> 02:44:57.828]  Sir, I don't owe you this comment.
[02:44:57.948 --> 02:45:03.430]  This is what's called ambush journalism, and I disrespect you for that as well.
[02:45:03.450 --> 02:45:04.110]  So thank you, and goodbye.
[02:45:04.130 --> 02:45:04.890]  Have you ever done the ritual?
[02:45:05.646 --> 02:45:06.928]  That's none of your damn business.
[02:45:07.648 --> 02:45:09.210]  Oh!
[02:45:09.791 --> 02:45:10.091]  Listen.
[02:45:10.592 --> 02:45:10.852]  Listen.
[02:45:11.533 --> 02:45:15.218]  You go around and make understandings with people and violate them.
[02:45:16.079 --> 02:45:20.304]  You ambush people on the streets and that's an inappropriate form of journalism.
[02:45:20.524 --> 02:45:22.026]  If you wish to practice that, that's fine.
[02:45:22.226 --> 02:45:23.828]  But don't ask others to respect you for it.
[02:45:24.716 --> 02:45:27.097]  You can do your pre-American like anything you want.
[02:45:27.377 --> 02:45:30.498]  If you want to be uncivil, and rude, and ungentlemanly, that's up to you.
[02:45:30.738 --> 02:45:33.820]  But don't expect the rest of us to say, oh well, you're a... You guys are setting policy in there, Mr. Gergen.
[02:45:33.880 --> 02:45:35.600]  I'm sorry, nobody sets policy in there.
[02:45:35.861 --> 02:45:39.342]  We try to be gentleman, and obviously, you don't belong there.
[02:45:39.362 --> 02:45:40.622]  Weaving spiders coming out here?
[02:45:41.883 --> 02:45:46.805]  And then he walks away and I go, whoo, that was a three-pointer.
[02:45:47.754 --> 02:45:48.454]  And we played that.
[02:45:48.554 --> 02:45:51.455]  George Norrie let me play that a few weeks ago when I was on his broadcast.
[02:45:51.495 --> 02:45:54.736]  I thought, hey, I ought to let my own listeners hear that today.
[02:45:54.776 --> 02:46:03.779]  But again, folks, all I was doing was asking him about it.
[02:46:03.859 --> 02:46:04.599]  He didn't deny it.
[02:46:04.899 --> 02:46:05.459]  You noticed that.
[02:46:05.559 --> 02:46:10.881]  And he turned bright red when I talked about the ritual and, you know, do you take part in the ritual?
[02:46:12.522 --> 02:46:15.482]  And he started hanging over me and poking at me with his finger.
[02:46:18.098 --> 02:46:19.798]  Very, very bizarre.
[02:46:20.798 --> 02:46:22.759]  Let's talk to Lance in Colorado.
[02:46:22.799 --> 02:46:23.619]  Lance, you're on the air.
[02:46:23.659 --> 02:46:24.319]  Thanks for holding.
[02:46:26.699 --> 02:46:27.700]  Good to talk to you, Lance.
[02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:31.120]  All right, Lance is gone.
[02:46:31.580 --> 02:46:32.520]  Don in Indiana.
[02:46:32.560 --> 02:46:33.401]  Don, you're on the air.
[02:46:33.441 --> 02:46:33.881]  Go ahead.
[02:46:34.821 --> 02:46:35.401]  Hello, Alex.
[02:46:35.781 --> 02:46:36.061]  Hello.
[02:46:36.901 --> 02:46:37.381]  How you been?
[02:46:37.421 --> 02:46:38.281]  Good hearing you again.
[02:46:38.301 --> 02:46:41.022]  Well, good to... Oh, this is... I haven't heard from you in about a year.
[02:46:41.582 --> 02:46:43.042]  You're the federal marshal.
[02:46:43.302 --> 02:46:44.142]  Yeah, retired.
[02:46:44.422 --> 02:46:45.063]  Yeah, what's up?
[02:46:45.643 --> 02:46:47.163]  Still with you after all these years, buddy.
[02:46:48.770 --> 02:46:53.934]  Uh, I'm sitting here and I'm looking at a picture of, uh, Glock firearms.
[02:46:53.955 --> 02:46:56.897]  It's got New World Order on it.
[02:46:57.077 --> 02:46:58.638]  Yeah, the Desert Storm Glock.
[02:46:58.738 --> 02:46:59.179]  I was shocked.
[02:46:59.259 --> 02:46:59.959]  I just saw it.
[02:47:00.760 --> 02:47:06.245]  Right stamped on the top of the, on the side, left of the sliders, New World Order Commandment.
[02:47:07.486 --> 02:47:17.354]  And they sent 15 of the first ones to, uh, Bush, Schwarzkopf, Baker, Kohlenpau, Chaney, Gaupthoff, and a bunch of generals and admirals.
[02:47:19.221 --> 02:47:23.022]  Yep, they sent out, what, a couple thousand of those bad babies.
[02:47:23.082 --> 02:47:33.024]  Yeah, they made a thousand, and the first fifteen were put in cases and all that with these guys' names stamped on them and given to these guys.
[02:47:34.305 --> 02:47:37.545]  So, you know, you talk about a telling thing, and that was back in 92.
[02:47:38.185 --> 02:47:39.886]  And who else talked about a New World Order?
[02:47:40.466 --> 02:47:41.366]  Adolf Hitler.
[02:47:41.766 --> 02:47:42.266]  Exactly.
[02:47:43.227 --> 02:47:45.827]  Well, the New World Order doesn't exist if you talk about it, you're crazy.
[02:47:46.167 --> 02:47:46.367]  Yeah.
[02:47:46.848 --> 02:47:48.668]  Well, Glock knows all about it, apparently.
[02:47:49.585 --> 02:47:51.006]  Oh, they're good Austrian folks!
[02:47:51.206 --> 02:47:51.586]  Yeah.
[02:47:52.487 --> 02:47:54.988]  All out of Europe.
[02:47:55.108 --> 02:47:57.130]  I thought I'd call just to mention that to you.
[02:47:57.230 --> 02:48:01.653]  Anybody could pick it up probably just by typing in Desert Storm Glock.
[02:48:02.073 --> 02:48:05.455]  It's on, we posted it about two weeks ago on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:48:05.555 --> 02:48:06.275]  Oh, did you on it?
[02:48:06.435 --> 02:48:06.676]  Yeah.
[02:48:08.117 --> 02:48:09.637]  Okay, I... Quite a collector gun, yeah.
[02:48:11.167 --> 02:48:13.848]  The lot made, I think it was over a thousand of them.
[02:48:14.768 --> 02:48:17.288]  And sent them out to globalists.
[02:48:18.549 --> 02:48:21.889]  New world order can emerge.
[02:48:22.290 --> 02:48:22.870]  Anything else?
[02:48:22.890 --> 02:48:23.870]  That's it, sir.
[02:48:24.430 --> 02:48:25.770]  What do you think of the old police state?
[02:48:26.971 --> 02:48:29.071]  Well, it's here and it's in your face.
[02:48:29.231 --> 02:48:30.691]  I don't know how anybody can deny it.
[02:48:31.512 --> 02:48:32.092]  Stay there.
[02:48:32.112 --> 02:48:33.592]  I want to talk to you on the other side.
[02:48:33.652 --> 02:48:34.732]  You called about a year ago.
[02:48:35.292 --> 02:48:37.613]  You talked about a lot of people in law enforcement waking up.
[02:48:38.266 --> 02:48:39.647]  He just retired a few years ago.
[02:48:39.667 --> 02:48:41.969]  I want to hear about how people are responding now.
[02:48:42.509 --> 02:48:43.230]  Are they waking up?
[02:48:43.270 --> 02:48:43.910]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:48.554 --> 02:48:55.960]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:48:56.220 --> 02:49:00.963]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:49:01.184 --> 02:49:06.828]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:49:07.048 --> 02:49:11.611]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:49:11.791 --> 02:49:18.936]  The casual society control grid, impenetrable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:49:18.976 --> 02:49:19.776]  soil, the U.S.A.
[02:49:19.796 --> 02:49:23.519]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:49:23.679 --> 02:49:26.200]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:49:26.421 --> 02:49:31.664]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroy
[02:49:31.664 --> 02:49:32.084]  We're good to go.
[02:49:47.819 --> 02:49:51.384]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[02:49:51.424 --> 02:49:51.944]  are located?
[02:49:52.145 --> 02:49:55.529]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[02:51:48.320 --> 02:51:51.082]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:51:51.102 --> 02:51:54.964]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:57.946 --> 02:52:00.928]  Lost in a Roman wilderness of pain.
[02:52:02.108 --> 02:52:05.711]  And all the children are insane.
[02:52:06.831 --> 02:52:11.954]  Our society is going crazy around us in this modern Roman Empire, this new world odor.
[02:52:13.644 --> 02:52:15.885]  Let's go ahead and go back to Don in Indiana.
[02:52:15.905 --> 02:52:17.565]  Yeah, Don, you sent me a lot of good stuff.
[02:52:17.585 --> 02:52:22.106]  The SLAT training manuals and all the New World Order stuff.
[02:52:22.146 --> 02:52:23.147]  I hadn't heard from you in a while.
[02:52:23.487 --> 02:52:28.208]  But last time I talked to you, you said a lot of your buddies in law enforcement are really waking up to what was going on.
[02:52:28.228 --> 02:52:32.509]  I mean, not all of them, but a small percentage, but still a hefty percentage.
[02:52:33.930 --> 02:52:35.850]  Any comments or any developments there for us?
[02:52:36.890 --> 02:52:41.492]  Well, I noticed they all talk pretty openly about what's happening now.
[02:52:41.692 --> 02:52:42.792]  I mean, they can see it.
[02:52:44.020 --> 02:52:46.542]  Uh, very few of them can't see it.
[02:52:47.382 --> 02:52:48.263]  What do they say about it?
[02:52:48.343 --> 02:52:49.403]  I mean, what do they say?
[02:52:49.964 --> 02:52:51.605]  America's turning into a police state, or?
[02:52:52.105 --> 02:52:53.326]  Oh, they totally agree with it.
[02:52:53.406 --> 02:53:00.330]  I mean, you know, they're wearing black uniforms, or they're doing checkpoints, or, you know, they're involved in all of it, you know.
[02:53:00.390 --> 02:53:05.994]  I mean, they're getting paid real good for it, and that kind of worries me, because, you know... Twenty pieces of silver, yeah!
[02:53:06.354 --> 02:53:12.818]  I know, and uh... But they all know, I mean, you know, they all know they're basically military now, and...
[02:53:16.001 --> 02:53:22.702]  The younger ones, they still kind of really worry me because it seems to me they're going to pretty much do what they're told to do.
[02:53:25.943 --> 02:53:28.083]  Well, I don't see much hope for it not happening.
[02:53:28.143 --> 02:53:29.004]  It's already here.
[02:53:29.824 --> 02:53:33.305]  I mean, you're completely surrounded by it.
[02:53:33.645 --> 02:53:36.405]  Yeah, everybody's completely surrounded but the city gates.
[02:53:36.465 --> 02:53:37.666]  The borders are wide open.
[02:53:38.026 --> 02:53:38.746]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:53:39.958 --> 02:53:42.660]  You ever point that out to them or they just don't get it?
[02:53:42.900 --> 02:53:43.600]  No, they get it.
[02:53:43.640 --> 02:53:45.622]  Freedom is enslaving the people, I guess.
[02:53:45.642 --> 02:53:52.886]  They get it, and you know, the thing is, they know that when it finally blows, they're going to take the brunt of it, too, and I know they're worried about that.
[02:53:53.066 --> 02:53:55.828]  So they know about the New World Order, they just say, I'm part of it?
[02:53:56.328 --> 02:53:56.849]  Exactly.
[02:53:57.089 --> 02:53:58.730]  And they know it's bad?
[02:54:00.531 --> 02:54:03.553]  I think they know that it's something that they're going to have to do.
[02:54:04.910 --> 02:54:07.651]  When it comes down to it, they're thinking about themselves.
[02:54:08.452 --> 02:54:13.254]  Well, what percentage of, yeah, if it's going to be a slave state, I might as well be a boss in it.
[02:54:13.274 --> 02:54:17.515]  What about the percentage you said that don't like it, talking to you?
[02:54:18.316 --> 02:54:31.021]  Well, there's probably about five, maybe ten percent that agree that soon they're going to have to fight and it's not going to be on the side of the New World Order.
[02:54:31.681 --> 02:54:33.242]  That part does exist.
[02:54:34.375 --> 02:54:35.416]  And that's undeniable.
[02:54:35.436 --> 02:54:41.498]  It's a small percentage, and it's probably about pair with the... But those types are worth ten times the others.
[02:54:41.558 --> 02:54:42.579]  Hey, I appreciate your call.
[02:54:42.799 --> 02:54:43.159]  Okay, Al.
[02:54:43.399 --> 02:54:45.881]  Good to hear from you, because they morally have courage.
[02:54:46.041 --> 02:54:50.263]  They're morally and psychologically strong to be able to not go along with the peer pressure.
[02:54:52.044 --> 02:54:55.185]  Yep, and the globalists don't care about you minions that serve them.
[02:54:55.565 --> 02:55:00.888]  Before I end this Valentine's Day broadcast, I hope that you will
[02:55:02.515 --> 02:55:04.316]  Join me in the fight against the New World Order.
[02:55:04.376 --> 02:55:05.396]  I've put everything on the line.
[02:55:05.436 --> 02:55:06.116]  This is my life.
[02:55:06.656 --> 02:55:09.337]  I've poured my heart and soul out into these films.
[02:55:09.457 --> 02:55:12.238]  One wish is that you get them and make copies of them and get them out to people.
[02:55:12.418 --> 02:55:16.359]  I hope you'd call and ask about the different specials, different titles, different films we've got.
[02:55:16.779 --> 02:55:18.639]  They'll answer your questions and then order some of them.

[02:55:48.696 --> 02:55:50.376]  We stand at the crossroads of history.
[02:55:50.436 --> 02:55:59.220]  The elite we have is the most decadent, corrupt, and wicked ever known in human history, and they're threatened by humanity, they're threatened by liberty and decency, and they want to enslave you.
[02:56:00.296 --> 02:56:02.338]  That's been history, and now it's repeating itself.
[02:56:02.358 --> 02:56:07.442]  Do you want to go along with it and buy the propaganda and tell yourself everything's okay and make you think you're part of the system?
[02:56:07.702 --> 02:56:08.383]  Because you're not.
[02:56:09.183 --> 02:56:10.244]  Defend this country.
[02:56:10.785 --> 02:56:15.068]  Defend your birthright for this generation and future generations to come.
[02:56:16.790 --> 02:56:26.978]  And I'll see you back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time on the growing list of AM and FM affiliates, or on Global Shortwave at 3210, or the web, as I said, at InfoWars.com.
