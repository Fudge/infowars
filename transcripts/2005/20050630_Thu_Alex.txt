[00:00:05.616 --> 00:00:06.297]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.937 --> 00:00:07.998]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:09.820]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.301]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:13.963]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.983 --> 00:00:17.286]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.786 --> 00:00:21.930]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.473 --> 00:00:32.859]  Welcome, my friends, listening across the United States and around the world and to all the ships at sea.
[00:00:33.752 --> 00:00:35.413]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:38.013 --> 00:00:41.754]  It is Thursday, the 30th day of June, 2005.
[00:00:42.335 --> 00:00:45.456]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:46.596 --> 00:01:00.400]  Our friends in the Congress have introduced a gun control bill under the guise of fighting gangs, and Larry Pratt will be joining us coming up in the next hour, the head of Gun Owners of America, to discuss it.
[00:01:01.724 --> 00:01:12.587]  Also, how the new National ID Card is going to be affecting gun owners as it's implemented through the state driver's license and state ID issuance facilities.
[00:01:14.948 --> 00:01:17.748]  We're going to have wide open phones throughout the broadcast.
[00:01:17.808 --> 00:01:24.150]  I'll be going to your calls very early in the shower and I'm going to blitz through them as quickly as possible so the next person can get on air.
[00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:30.852]  Any news item, any story, any piece of propaganda you saw on the news or rather the newspaper you'd like to discuss
[00:01:31.667 --> 00:01:34.469]  An issue we're not covering enough that you'd like to talk about?
[00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.630]  Wide open phones 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.730]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:35.751 --> 00:01:39.954]  We didn't talk enough yesterday about Lord Bush's speech, but I do have some analysis of it.
[00:01:50.416 --> 00:02:18.244]  He said insurgents 35 times, free and freedom 29 times, security 6 times, defend protect 15 times, election vote polls 10 times, mission 9 times, killers murderers 9 times, New York September 11th 7 times, war 7 times, violence 6 times, democracy democratic 5 times, liberty, liberta 4 times, attack 4 times, dissent 1 time.
[00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.433]  Now, of course, in my film, Martial Law, we just have a small sampling.
[00:02:24.473 --> 00:02:25.654]  We never repeat any of it.
[00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:33.580]  I've gotten emails and calls, you know, do you repeat any of them, you know, when Giuliani for like a minute and a half says 9-11, 9-11, 9-11, 9-11, 9-11?
[00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:35.142]  No, folks.
[00:02:36.423 --> 00:02:42.507]  We condensed all the speeches down of the major speakers at the RNC.
[00:02:42.527 --> 00:02:44.509]  It was like 40 minutes of it, okay?
[00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.593]  We put about three minutes of it in the film, and yes, it does illustrate things.
[00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:51.473]  Fear-mongering.
[00:02:52.754 --> 00:02:59.016]  But the coming up anti-gang bill, endangers gun rights, The Sun of World Net Daily, also Italy presses U.S.
[00:02:59.056 --> 00:03:00.376]  on CIA kidnappers.
[00:03:01.677 --> 00:03:03.757]  Children, too, are abused in U.S.
[00:03:03.837 --> 00:03:04.278]  prisons.
[00:03:04.338 --> 00:03:04.978]  Of course they are.
[00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:08.579]  They're tortured to death and raped in front of their parents.
[00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.512]  But our media says that that's how you defeat Al-Qaeda.
[00:03:13.672 --> 00:03:14.452]  Al-C-I-A-D-A.
[00:03:14.913 --> 00:03:17.274]  Bush sets up domestic spy services.
[00:03:17.754 --> 00:03:20.416]  BBC, or New Domestic KGB.
[00:03:21.756 --> 00:03:25.058]  Run by the new head of intelligence, Negroponte, who set up the death squads.
[00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.120]  Starting to see a pattern here.
[00:03:30.061 --> 00:03:30.201]  U.S.
[00:03:30.241 --> 00:03:32.362]  tried to conceal anti-CAFTA reports.
[00:03:32.402 --> 00:03:33.103]  More on that.
[00:03:34.364 --> 00:03:38.446]  By the way, that's passed in the House, into the full House, and it's going into the full Senate.
[00:03:39.051 --> 00:03:42.152]  We could have CAFTA pass here in the next few days.
[00:03:42.192 --> 00:03:46.794]  I hope not, but everybody's against it, so they'll probably pass it.
[00:03:46.834 --> 00:03:48.055]  That's how they operate.
[00:03:48.115 --> 00:03:53.838]  President Bush, again, is setting up an intelligence, private intelligence agencies.
[00:03:54.158 --> 00:03:56.579]  You name it here domestically, we'll be going over that.
[00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:03.602]  More details on the plan to take Justice Souter's home, because he likes to steal homes and build a hotel there.
[00:04:04.523 --> 00:04:10.527]  And Hawkeye's Eye Mercury, Iowa becomes the first state to ban the Marisol from vaccines.
[00:04:10.567 --> 00:04:13.670]  New York has passed it in its Senate, it's gone to the Governor.
[00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.053]  And a bunch of other states are following suit, so some good news there.
[00:04:18.433 --> 00:04:22.876]  A lawmaker's wayward email refers to constituents as idiots.
[00:04:23.817 --> 00:04:24.997]  That's what they normally call us.
[00:04:25.798 --> 00:04:28.340]  And a student gets an F grade for mentioning God.
[00:04:29.153 --> 00:04:33.938]  He told me you might as well write about the Easter Bunny, so now if they don't like your views, you're punished for them.
[00:04:34.418 --> 00:04:35.019]  Clock crime.
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.182]  Hannity says that PNAC doesn't exist.
[00:04:38.282 --> 00:04:39.564]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[00:04:40.104 --> 00:04:47.692]  We have that clip coming up, and also something I never got to yesterday, the Fox News piece where they explain the fake applause for Lord Bush two nights ago.
[00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:49.501]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:49.541 --> 00:04:50.202]  Your calls.
[00:04:50.242 --> 00:04:51.044]  A great guest.
[00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:52.266]  A ton of vital news.
[00:04:52.888 --> 00:04:55.052]  And yes, my ranting and raving and analysis.

[00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:05.141]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:06.942]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.

[00:05:12.325 --> 00:05:16.767]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:05:17.167 --> 00:05:21.370]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:22.210]  The Constitution
[00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.610]  We're good to go.

[00:07:03.894 --> 00:07:07.737]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:07:08.037 --> 00:07:08.878]  Read the labels.
[00:07:09.298 --> 00:07:13.441]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:17.844]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:07:18.224 --> 00:07:23.088]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.

[00:07:51.026 --> 00:07:51.367]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.963 --> 00:08:08.004]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.724 --> 00:08:09.824]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.485 --> 00:08:11.305]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.065 --> 00:08:12.986]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.626 --> 00:08:17.287]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.808 --> 00:08:21.949]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:28.712]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:28.772 --> 00:08:29.473]  It is Thursday.
[00:08:29.493 --> 00:08:30.733]  We're now to the second segment.
[00:08:30.753 --> 00:08:32.214]  I know a lot of stations join us now.
[00:08:33.815 --> 00:08:42.980]  We've got Larry Pratt coming up in the second hour to discuss new gun control legislation coming out of the Congress.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.241]  And they're being very deceptive.
[00:08:45.261 --> 00:08:50.924]  You know, they try to pass a hate crimes law that will restrict free speech of all Americans, leftists, conservatives.
[00:08:51.384 --> 00:08:52.184]  It doesn't matter.
[00:08:52.204 --> 00:08:55.466]  They call it the Local Law Enforcement Assistance Act.
[00:08:56.303 --> 00:09:02.209]  When they come out with gun control now, they call it, you know, the Anti-Gang Act, or Anti-Gang Bill.
[00:09:02.229 --> 00:09:03.851]  It has nothing to do with gangs.
[00:09:04.651 --> 00:09:15.062]  And Larry Pratt will be joining us to talk about that, and just the state of the Second Amendment at the state and federal level, the local level, as well as the national level.
[00:09:15.102 --> 00:09:18.205]  We'll also have wide open phones throughout the broadcast.
[00:09:18.445 --> 00:09:20.067]  Just so much news coming out.
[00:09:21.325 --> 00:09:23.506]  Is Dick Cheney having heart problems again?
[00:09:23.546 --> 00:09:24.466]  Are they covering it up?
[00:09:24.906 --> 00:09:25.767]  Frankly, I don't care.
[00:09:25.787 --> 00:09:26.427]  It doesn't matter.
[00:09:26.467 --> 00:09:27.767]  The guy's a puppet to begin with.
[00:09:27.807 --> 00:09:31.949]  If you think the buck stops with the President and the Vice President, you've got another thing coming.
[00:09:32.249 --> 00:09:38.031]  The buck stops with the Bilderberg Group in Europe, which the mainstream media now admits is the power elite and is running things.
[00:09:38.571 --> 00:09:39.732]  All these years they denied it.
[00:09:39.792 --> 00:09:40.492]  Now they just admit it.
[00:09:40.532 --> 00:09:42.513]  But that's in your best interest.
[00:09:42.553 --> 00:09:43.313]  Just submit to it.
[00:09:44.477 --> 00:09:45.917]  Also, Italy is pressing the U.S.
[00:09:45.977 --> 00:09:55.480]  on CIA kidnappers who kidnap people and took them to foreign countries for torture with no warrants or no, uh... I mean, some foreign countries don't, uh... you know, they take umbrage with that.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.941]  They don't appreciate that.
[00:09:57.001 --> 00:09:59.662]  Meanwhile, New York Times is admitting something we knew three years ago.
[00:10:00.282 --> 00:10:02.443]  Children, too, are abused in U.S.
[00:10:02.483 --> 00:10:02.923]  prisons.
[00:10:03.723 --> 00:10:07.084]  And why do we know that children are being tortured and abused?
[00:10:08.283 --> 00:10:20.591]  Because the CIA Section Chief bragged in early 2002, and it's in my film, The Road to Tyranny, the blow-up of the Washington Post article, they thought that we were all going along with them at that time.
[00:10:20.611 --> 00:10:23.593]  A lot of folks hadn't woke up yet, so they were being very overt about torture.
[00:10:24.093 --> 00:10:30.877]  And they said, yes, we take them to Egypt and to Jordan, and we torture them, and we take their families there, and we torture them too.
[00:10:33.199 --> 00:10:34.920]  And that leads me into PNAC.
[00:10:36.621 --> 00:10:47.486]  You know, everybody focuses on Richard Clark and goes, well, he's a Democratic holdover and that's why he says Bush was planning to invade Iraq day one and had maps of the oil fields up with Dick Cheney rubbing his hands together.
[00:10:47.746 --> 00:10:48.686]  It's all made up!
[00:10:48.746 --> 00:10:50.187]  It's all lies, evil Democrat!
[00:10:51.573 --> 00:10:58.977]  And then Treasury Secretary O'Neill, who was a very, very conservative Republican, he didn't squeeze the third world quite enough.
[00:10:59.037 --> 00:11:05.620]  He actually got a little soft-hearted and didn't want to totally enslave people with IMF World Bank money.
[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:09.842]  I'm not saying he's perfect, but he didn't show that he was aggressive enough, literally.
[00:11:10.082 --> 00:11:12.283]  We've got White House memos where he's not aggressive enough.
[00:11:12.983 --> 00:11:14.464]  He's not squeezing them.
[00:11:15.794 --> 00:11:21.536]  So he was out, and he said, oh yeah, day one, I just wanted to help third world countries and really try to fix the debt.
[00:11:22.597 --> 00:11:27.579]  And they just kept going, no, no, no, the President was not going to talk to you about that, it's about Iraq and oil!
[00:11:29.419 --> 00:11:34.921]  And they said, well, he's just got sour grapes and he's an evil person, probably a Democrat.
[00:11:36.142 --> 00:11:41.304]  Forget what the Democrats are up to, we have not just Pinak, but Bush's biographer.
[00:11:42.449 --> 00:11:48.374]  Saying, oh yeah, 99, all he talked about was, I'm gonna be a war president, that makes you popular, you can do whatever you want.
[00:11:48.694 --> 00:11:52.257]  When you're a wartime president, history shows, I'm gonna attack Iraq.
[00:11:52.918 --> 00:11:55.840]  But, during the campaign in 2000, oh no, we'll never attack them.
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:59.884]  Oh no, we shouldn't go to countries and say, this is what you need to do, and this is what you should do.
[00:11:59.904 --> 00:12:02.145]  You know, we've got all those clips.
[00:12:04.187 --> 00:12:05.268]  But, again, forget that.
[00:12:05.388 --> 00:12:08.691]  With PNAC, there was a bunch of other white papers put out by the Pentagon and others, but
[00:12:09.925 --> 00:12:13.366]  You're talking about almost the entire Bush administration, the entire cabinet.
[00:12:13.386 --> 00:12:18.467]  I mean, we're talking about Dick Cheney, we're talking about Jeb Bush, we're talking about Wolfowitz, now head of the World Bank.
[00:12:18.707 --> 00:12:29.610]  We're talking about Richard Perle, we're talking about Donald Rumsfeld, we're talking about all of these guys, 25 people, set up in 96, and they put out literally hundreds of documents.
[00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.651]  I mean, just type in PNAC, you'll get their official website.
[00:12:32.691 --> 00:12:33.891]  I mean, they're proud of it.
[00:12:34.131 --> 00:12:36.612]  They put out hardcover books with this stuff.
[00:12:37.469 --> 00:12:40.450]  Imagine if I published a book and said, I want to invade Iraq.
[00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:47.393]  Iraq isn't a threat, but we'll tell people that they have weapons of mass destruction, and we'll get the oil, and use Iraq as a military launch base.
[00:12:48.213 --> 00:12:59.538]  I mean, imagine if I wrote a book, okay, and then years later, a year later, I'm president, and then I do that, and I lie to everybody, and people are going, did he lie?
[00:12:59.558 --> 00:13:00.318]  Hmm, I don't know.
[00:13:00.618 --> 00:13:00.979]  Did he?
[00:13:01.019 --> 00:13:01.539]  Did he?
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.120]  Folks, we have
[00:13:05.143 --> 00:13:21.091]  The Vice President, in one of these documents, or linked to on PrisonPlanet.com, Cheney openly says what I just quoted earlier about we need to invade Iraq as a pretext, using the WMDs.
[00:13:22.757 --> 00:13:23.917]  And all of that is ignored.
[00:13:24.437 --> 00:13:25.878]  And I have been on talk shows.
[00:13:26.018 --> 00:13:27.678]  I've been on, you know, a talk show in San Diego.
[00:13:27.698 --> 00:13:28.998]  I've been on a talk show in New York.
[00:13:29.398 --> 00:13:36.660]  There's two I remember in the last, you know, three or four months, where the talk show host, when I brought up PNAC, said conspiracy theory.
[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:47.102]  In fact, I was on Coast to Coast AM, and Peter Lantz, you know, the former Nightline producer, I brought up PNAC and he said conspiracy theory.
[00:13:47.702 --> 00:13:49.462]  Now, I'm totally confused here.
[00:13:51.064 --> 00:14:04.754]  I mean, that's like saying that Encyclopedia Britannica publishes hardbound encyclopedias every year, and I go, yes, you can go buy a set of Encyclopedia Britannica, and then they go, no, it doesn't exist.
[00:14:04.794 --> 00:14:07.436]  Encyclopedia Britannica doesn't exist, and you're crazy.
[00:14:07.976 --> 00:14:13.861]  It's like going, um, you know, I overused the example of, the sun came up this morning, and they go, no, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:14:14.421 --> 00:14:16.703]  But I mean, it's at that same level.
[00:14:18.163 --> 00:14:26.569]  And I have people that email me, they won't call in for some reason, and say, oh, they never said there were WMDs, or they say, oh, they found WMDs.
[00:14:27.029 --> 00:14:29.951]  They remember all the fake reports and they never saw the retractions.
[00:14:31.752 --> 00:14:33.853]  So, I don't know how to handle this or how to deal with it.
[00:14:35.354 --> 00:14:46.842]  I mean, it's so overt now, and Sean Hannity, two nights ago, we're analyzing this propaganda here, Rangel brought up PNAT.
[00:14:48.038 --> 00:14:49.639]  Project for a New American Century.
[00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:56.085]  And, uh... Hey, Congressman Rangel, we'd like to thank you for the conspiracy theory portion of the show.
[00:14:56.185 --> 00:14:57.887]  Rangel, conspiracy is what you said.
[00:14:57.927 --> 00:15:01.250]  I'm saying the President wanted to knock off Saddam before 9-11.
[00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:02.671]  All right, we appreciate it.
[00:15:02.711 --> 00:15:04.613]  Next time, we'll get some evidence.
[00:15:05.594 --> 00:15:07.135]  Implying he didn't give any evidence.
[00:15:09.037 --> 00:15:12.760]  So, I mean, it just... In fact, here is the exchange.
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:14.422]  But before we play the exchange, I just want to say this.
[00:15:15.243 --> 00:15:16.644]  They also make it real partisan.
[00:15:16.724 --> 00:15:18.985]  And, you know, the Democrats are implying Bush lied.
[00:15:19.246 --> 00:15:20.686]  How preposterous!
[00:15:21.847 --> 00:15:22.988]  Of course they lied!
[00:15:23.548 --> 00:15:24.489]  Everybody knows it!
[00:15:24.529 --> 00:15:26.150]  The Downing Street Memo, all of it!
[00:15:27.331 --> 00:15:28.852]  The fake Niger documents!
[00:15:29.372 --> 00:15:31.593]  The fake aluminum tube documents!
[00:15:31.693 --> 00:15:32.514]  Just all of it!
[00:15:32.534 --> 00:15:33.895]  It would take hours!
[00:15:33.915 --> 00:15:37.597]  You know, twelve-year-old graduate student papers, holding it up in front of the U.N.
[00:15:37.617 --> 00:15:39.278]  and going, this is the latest intelligence!
[00:15:39.738 --> 00:15:41.940]  They ain't gonna get us in forty-five minutes!
[00:15:43.541 --> 00:15:43.941]  Oh, man.
[00:15:44.784 --> 00:15:52.909]  And they couldn't even get the CIA to write up thick documents, so they just go grab some graduate paper 12 years ago, change the name on it, and mark top secret on it.
[00:15:52.929 --> 00:15:56.091]  I mean... Go ahead and roll it, please.
[00:15:56.611 --> 00:16:02.254]  I have heard the President called a liar repeatedly by the leaders of your party, that he misled the American people.
[00:16:02.274 --> 00:16:02.875]  I've heard that.
[00:16:02.915 --> 00:16:04.936]  That he concocted a war for political gain.
[00:16:05.516 --> 00:16:08.498]  Howard Dean says Republicans are evil, brain-dead, corrupted.
[00:16:08.518 --> 00:16:13.401]  He's called them every other name in the book, so we should, I guess, anticipate that your Democratic friends didn't like the speech tonight?
[00:16:14.418 --> 00:16:21.186]  I'm not saying it's a Democratic thing, and I think it's shameful when we have the troops there to be talking like Democrats and Republicans.
[00:16:21.286 --> 00:16:33.981]  I joined with the President in supporting the brave men and women out there, but I'm surprised why he would go back a half a dozen times to 9-1-1, when we know that America would never have supported the loss of 1,700 men and women.
[00:16:35.662 --> 00:16:41.347]  12,000 that are disabled as a result of the war and tens of thousands of Iraqis dead.
[00:16:41.647 --> 00:16:47.792]  This was supposed to be based on Saddam Hussein being involved one way or the other with 9-1-1.
[00:16:48.113 --> 00:16:51.856]  We don't find weapons of mass destruction.
[00:16:51.876 --> 00:16:58.121]  Without going down this debate again, you voted for a guy that said Saddam had biological, chemical and nuclear capability.
[00:16:58.161 --> 00:17:00.103]  You're one of Bill Clinton's closest friends.
[00:17:00.123 --> 00:17:01.264]  He bombed them because of
[00:17:01.824 --> 00:17:02.966]  That's a shameful thing to say!
[00:17:18.304 --> 00:17:32.147]  That if we knew what we knew today, with all of the people saying that he never, he already intended to knock off Saddam Hussein before 9-1-1, all of the people that worked in the Capitol... Is that what you believe?
[00:17:32.487 --> 00:17:33.387]  Wait, do you believe that?
[00:17:33.827 --> 00:17:39.208]  There is, listen, if you know about the project of a new America Century... You believe that?
[00:17:39.248 --> 00:17:41.229]  We had woeful whips, there's no question!
[00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:41.889]  You believe that?
[00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:43.929]  And the record is clear that the President... Wow!
[00:17:43.949 --> 00:17:44.009]  Wow!
[00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:44.870]  Let me tell you this.
[00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:45.430]  Wow!
[00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:46.870]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[00:17:48.011 --> 00:17:49.433]  Listen, you don't let me finish.
[00:17:49.653 --> 00:17:50.214]  You can finish.
[00:17:50.234 --> 00:17:50.775]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:17:50.815 --> 00:17:51.115]  I'm up.
[00:17:51.155 --> 00:17:52.017]  It's your time to talk.
[00:17:52.057 --> 00:17:52.357]  Go ahead.
[00:17:52.597 --> 00:18:02.451]  I am telling you that the country is beginning to know that long before 9-1-1, President Bush wanted to knock off Saddam Hussein.
[00:18:02.531 --> 00:18:03.913]  You know it and I know it.
[00:18:04.814 --> 00:18:05.895]  Where's your proof?
[00:18:05.935 --> 00:18:10.898]  By the way, there's a report in the British press over the last couple of days that we doubled bombing runs in the run-up to the war.
[00:18:11.358 --> 00:18:16.001]  They tried to provoke Saddam Hussein prior to the actual beginning of the war.
[00:18:16.401 --> 00:18:17.862]  We have the Downing Street Memo.
[00:18:18.242 --> 00:18:19.843]  None of this, of course, was addressed tonight.
[00:18:20.164 --> 00:18:21.785]  We kept the same old tired rhetoric.
[00:18:22.005 --> 00:18:23.025]  No new information.
[00:18:23.386 --> 00:18:24.747]  No new rationale.
[00:18:25.647 --> 00:18:31.871]  In fact, the same old rationales that have already been disproven, like links between Saddam Hussein and September 11th as he opened up his speech.
[00:18:32.677 --> 00:18:35.177]  Six times, five or six times he mentioned this.
[00:18:35.558 --> 00:18:40.018]  And when we went over there, Rumsfeld said it would take two or three days or a week or so.
[00:18:40.298 --> 00:18:42.039]  Now they're talking about twelve years.
[00:18:43.199 --> 00:18:48.740]  The President has to understand, when you find yourself in a hole, the first thing you do is stop digging.
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:56.461]  You've got to level with the American people and we'll come together and get our allies to come and try to help Iraqis to do something in their country.
[00:18:56.801 --> 00:19:02.142]  But we're sick and tired of waiting for them to come up to defend their country and exposing us to death.
[00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:08.106]  Congressman Rangel, I think we saw tonight why 53% of the American people, according to a recent poll, disapprove of the President's performance.
[00:19:08.726 --> 00:19:15.591]  Why 52% say the administration, that's more than half, say the administration deliberately misled the American people.
[00:19:15.991 --> 00:19:19.894]  I don't know that anything was said or done tonight to correct that perception on the part of the American people.
[00:19:20.482 --> 00:19:21.122]  Not at all.
[00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:21.802]  Not at all.
[00:19:21.923 --> 00:19:28.565]  And all of the reasons that we thought that we were saving America, most people thought that it would involve 9-1-1.
[00:19:28.805 --> 00:19:30.925]  And Sean, you keep talking about Kerry.
[00:19:31.205 --> 00:19:32.966]  Kerry's not the Commander-in-Chief.
[00:19:33.166 --> 00:19:34.546]  He was not on television.
[00:19:34.786 --> 00:19:36.747]  He was not there talking to the troops.
[00:19:37.087 --> 00:19:39.068]  We expect more from our President.
[00:19:39.248 --> 00:19:40.208]  What should he have said tonight?
[00:19:40.508 --> 00:19:43.029]  Tell you what... He should have said, listen... Hit pause on that.
[00:19:43.049 --> 00:19:45.290]  When we come back, he says conspiracy theory again.
[00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:48.931]  And I'll talk about how the Democrats were complicit.
[00:19:48.971 --> 00:19:49.311]  They were!
[00:19:51.304 --> 00:19:52.466]  They're complicit in a lie, too.
[00:19:53.007 --> 00:19:54.029]  They're just as culpable.
[00:19:54.349 --> 00:19:55.031]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:55.051 --> 00:19:55.311]  Stay with us.
[00:19:55.331 --> 00:19:56.092]  This is The New York Calls.
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:09.023]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[00:20:09.563 --> 00:20:14.966]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now is the time to start using patented Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:20:15.386 --> 00:20:25.390]  All Natural Non-X is a topical, epinoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:27.871]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[00:20:28.272 --> 00:20:31.293]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[00:20:31.773 --> 00:20:32.954]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[00:20:33.074 --> 00:20:35.955]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris.
[00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:40.557]  It's podiatrist recommended and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[00:20:40.817 --> 00:20:42.537]  It's also money-back guarantee.
[00:20:42.897 --> 00:20:54.662]  You'll find Non-X Gel spelled N-O-N-Y-X in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks and independent pharmacies nationwide or online at drugstore.com.
[00:20:55.142 --> 00:20:59.504]  Non-X Nail Gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[00:21:01.076 --> 00:21:04.358]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:21:04.398 --> 00:21:08.600]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.622]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:21:11.802 --> 00:21:14.203]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:21:14.403 --> 00:21:23.048]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:21:23.228 --> 00:21:24.589]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:28.951]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:21:29.271 --> 00:21:29.911]  We're good to go!
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.720]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:22:01.541 --> 00:22:02.801]  Currency devaluation.
[00:22:03.622 --> 00:22:04.522]  Inflation.
[00:22:04.822 --> 00:22:05.542]  One and the same.
[00:22:06.862 --> 00:22:11.264]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:22:11.284 --> 00:22:13.524]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:22:13.564 --> 00:22:14.424]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:22:14.464 --> 00:22:16.205]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power
[00:22:28.024 --> 00:22:28.345]  I think?
[00:22:41.132 --> 00:22:44.994]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[00:22:45.794 --> 00:22:49.556]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.
[00:22:50.096 --> 00:22:51.577]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:51.617 --> 00:22:51.857]  That's 1-800-686-2237.

[00:23:05.426 --> 00:23:08.888]  But have you taken the next step and actually experienced energized water?

[00:23:58.139 --> 00:24:02.903]  Carlos in California.
[00:24:12.509 --> 00:24:16.031]  Martin Texas, Cindy in Delaware, Justin in Texas, Jeff and many others.
[00:24:16.632 --> 00:24:17.652]  Your calls are coming up.
[00:24:19.274 --> 00:24:32.022]  But let's go back to Hannity and Combs and just continue where we left off and then Hannity comes back in again with the term conspiracy theory and says no proof has been shown of PNAC.
[00:24:32.042 --> 00:24:33.963]  You know, PNAC is a conspiracy theory.
[00:24:34.223 --> 00:24:35.104]  Go ahead and roll that.
[00:24:36.355 --> 00:24:37.556]  Some mistakes were made.
[00:24:38.036 --> 00:24:41.457]  We had bad intelligence, but we did get rid of a bad guy.
[00:24:41.757 --> 00:24:55.443]  Now it's time for us to go to Europe and go to the rest of the world and organize and train these people and to tell them that we're not going to stay there for 12 years and expose our men and women to that danger just to protect this fragile government they have.
[00:24:55.783 --> 00:25:00.066]  Hey, Congressman Rangel, we'd like to thank you for the conspiracy theory portion of the program.
[00:25:00.086 --> 00:25:00.866]  I didn't say conspiracy!
[00:25:00.886 --> 00:25:03.628]  Thank you for the conspiracy theory portion of the show, and it's good to see you.
[00:25:03.648 --> 00:25:05.109]  Conspiracy is what you said!
[00:25:05.169 --> 00:25:08.871]  I'm saying the President wanted to knock off Saddam Hussein before 9-1-1.
[00:25:09.051 --> 00:25:10.892]  Alright, we appreciate it.
[00:25:10.912 --> 00:25:12.513]  Next time we'll get some evidence, but thank you.
[00:25:12.533 --> 00:25:16.816]  Next time we'll get some evidence, but thank you?
[00:25:16.836 --> 00:25:18.577]  And that's how it ended.
[00:25:18.657 --> 00:25:23.320]  So he said conspiracy theory four times in four minutes.
[00:25:25.231 --> 00:25:52.391]  And so we posted that, and since Hannity wants some proof, as if he doesn't know, he's a very smart individual, and we have links directly to the PNAC official website, and officially their big think tank, and directly to the Rebuilding America's Defenses September 2000 document, and we have links to Bush's biographer three weeks ago, saying that Bush told him in 99 that he was going to be a war president and that he would invade Iraq.
[00:25:53.675 --> 00:26:02.880]  And in the PNAC document, they say, that same document I just sourced, there's a bunch of others, that Dick Cheney says, we need a Pearl Harbor terrorist attack.
[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:07.582]  An event to help catalyze public support.
[00:26:07.622 --> 00:26:09.283]  And boy, what happened on 9-11!
[00:26:11.104 --> 00:26:13.365]  So, everything's a conspiracy theory, folks.
[00:26:13.385 --> 00:26:14.866]  You're breathing air right now.
[00:26:15.366 --> 00:26:16.647]  Everybody, let's take a deep breath in.
[00:26:17.867 --> 00:26:20.028]  We're carbon-based life forms that breathe oxygen.
[00:26:20.108 --> 00:26:21.569]  No, that's a conspiracy!
[00:26:22.329 --> 00:26:22.970]  I mean, folks,
[00:26:24.238 --> 00:26:26.819]  They just count on the public being totally ignorant.
[00:26:26.919 --> 00:26:36.002]  I have been accused of a conspiracy theory being on a bunch of talk shows by the people I'm debating or by the talk show host whenever I talk about PMAC.
[00:26:36.042 --> 00:26:39.023]  Now, Bill Clinton vacations with the Bushes.
[00:26:39.063 --> 00:26:40.643]  I mean, it's on a weekly basis now.
[00:26:40.663 --> 00:26:41.984]  I mean, every couple of weeks they're together.
[00:26:43.024 --> 00:26:46.245]  He always was buddies with them, going back to mean Arkansas before that.
[00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:48.171]  And it's just that simple.
[00:26:48.231 --> 00:26:50.333]  And of course, Bill Clinton attacked innocent Serbia.
[00:26:50.813 --> 00:26:51.794]  Totally proven now.
[00:26:51.894 --> 00:26:53.035]  Total fake newscast.
[00:26:53.416 --> 00:26:56.358]  You know, they'd have an area of food with barbed wire around it, guarding it.
[00:26:56.378 --> 00:26:59.441]  They'd show people in the early 90s and again in the late 90s.
[00:26:59.761 --> 00:27:03.545]  Both times, they would show people up there trying to get the food.
[00:27:03.605 --> 00:27:07.548]  They'd show one guy who had, you know, tuberculosis and who was skinny.
[00:27:07.568 --> 00:27:10.591]  Of course, when they show you the whole video, there's all these fat people around him.
[00:27:10.991 --> 00:27:12.633]  They go, look, a victim in a camp!
[00:27:13.627 --> 00:27:15.607]  And the British TV knew exactly what they were doing.
[00:27:15.627 --> 00:27:17.248]  Well, they did the same thing in the late 90s.
[00:27:17.928 --> 00:27:22.609]  They would not let people into Macedonia or into Albania or into the other countries surrounding it.
[00:27:22.629 --> 00:27:23.929]  They would have barbed wire fences up.
[00:27:23.949 --> 00:27:30.590]  People were there begging the Albanians, the minority that was fleeing Serbia, begging, let us out!
[00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:31.371]  They go, look at them!
[00:27:31.391 --> 00:27:32.631]  They're behind barbed wire!
[00:27:32.891 --> 00:27:33.571]  I remember!
[00:27:33.671 --> 00:27:34.371]  It's like, no!
[00:27:34.411 --> 00:27:38.612]  And then you'd read the news article to find print, oh, that's our barbed wire!
[00:27:39.192 --> 00:27:40.612]  That's the Coalition's barbed wire.
[00:27:40.632 --> 00:27:41.393]  That's NATO.
[00:27:41.793 --> 00:27:42.733]  I4 barbed wire.
[00:27:44.557 --> 00:27:44.797]  U.N.
[00:27:44.837 --> 00:27:45.338]  barbed wire.
[00:27:46.019 --> 00:27:46.759]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:27:46.799 --> 00:27:49.862]  A dumbed down public that doesn't know how many states there are.
[00:27:50.083 --> 00:27:51.084]  Most Americans don't know.
[00:27:51.584 --> 00:27:54.287]  High school seniors don't know who the vice president is in major polls.
[00:27:54.487 --> 00:27:56.068]  They can't find Iraq on a map.
[00:27:57.149 --> 00:27:58.210]  This is very upsetting.
[00:27:58.791 --> 00:28:03.716]  But they'll sit there and argue with me.
[00:28:05.618 --> 00:28:09.199]  They'll argue with me and go, you're just, no, you don't know what you're talking about, Alex.
[00:28:09.239 --> 00:28:10.379]  And I'm like, but I have facts.
[00:28:10.679 --> 00:28:11.239]  I have evidence.
[00:28:11.299 --> 00:28:11.979]  I have research.
[00:28:11.999 --> 00:28:12.679]  This is what I do.
[00:28:12.999 --> 00:28:15.060]  No, no, no, that's your opinion.
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.480]  But you can't find Iraq on a map.
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:24.622]  I mean, what is... Folks, we have an incredibly intelligent audience.
[00:28:24.982 --> 00:28:32.223]  And my last showing, the sixth showing of Martial Law, Monday at the Alamo Draft House, South Lamar, huge crowd of people.
[00:28:33.228 --> 00:28:35.569]  And I asked folks about, what, five of the ten amendments.
[00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:36.430]  Randomly.
[00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:46.996]  And the entire crowd of two hundred and thirty something people could only, this is an educated audience, could only tell me of the five I asked about, they could only tell me about two of them.
[00:28:49.437 --> 00:28:52.339]  And folks, the general public cannot tell you anything.
[00:28:52.799 --> 00:28:54.560]  Maybe a fragment of the second amendment.
[00:28:55.521 --> 00:28:59.843]  Maybe the freedom of the press, if you ask about the first amendment, when it has four clauses in it.
[00:29:01.374 --> 00:29:06.635]  Religion, protesting, petitioning the government, redress of grievances, you know, public assembly, all that.
[00:29:08.835 --> 00:29:10.796]  So, we're in trouble, folks.
[00:29:10.936 --> 00:29:11.796]  I'm not that smart.
[00:29:11.816 --> 00:29:12.696]  Okay, this is what scares me.
[00:29:12.996 --> 00:29:14.236]  I know all about this stuff.
[00:29:14.256 --> 00:29:15.036]  This is what I research.
[00:29:15.056 --> 00:29:15.777]  This is what I do.
[00:29:16.417 --> 00:29:17.857]  And then I talk to educated people.
[00:29:17.917 --> 00:29:22.278]  I know people who've got jobs, you know, making $200,000 a year, folks, and they're smart.
[00:29:22.658 --> 00:29:24.158]  They're as smart as a whip.
[00:29:25.158 --> 00:29:26.319]  They're as sharp as a tack.
[00:29:26.399 --> 00:29:28.739]  But they don't know anything about America.
[00:29:30.623 --> 00:29:36.788]  Okay, so, if you spend a little time learning about your history, then you'll figure out how much tyranny you're under.
[00:29:37.689 --> 00:29:39.891]  People do know, though, that we're supposed to have private property.
[00:29:40.431 --> 00:29:42.833]  That's why the Supreme Court ruling has got people hopping mad.
[00:29:43.193 --> 00:29:47.797]  A bunch of news coming up, but first, your calls, directly on the other side of this quick break.
[00:29:48.238 --> 00:29:48.818]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:52.841]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.081 --> 00:29:54.703]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.604 --> 00:29:58.286]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.407 --> 00:30:11.855]  If you're concerned about keeping your cardiovascular system healthy but don't want to take prescription drugs, then take a look at HardenedBodyExtract.com from Healthy Hearts Club.

[00:30:25.287 --> 00:30:25.728]  I don't know.
[00:30:42.449 --> 00:30:42.890]  Death?
[00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:44.792]  Don't take unnecessary risks!

[00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:09.454]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:09.715 --> 00:31:14.078]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.359 --> 00:31:23.287]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.

[00:31:32.716 --> 00:31:39.463]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:31:39.924 --> 00:31:40.485]  What about you?
[00:31:41.229 --> 00:31:46.131]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35.

[00:32:04.757 --> 00:32:05.617]  Look no further!

[00:32:30.327 --> 00:32:34.989]  Northern Voice Bookstore offers a broad range of different perspectives
[00:32:35.109 --> 00:32:35.589]  We're good.
[00:33:09.821 --> 00:33:13.244]  Folks, PNAC called for attacking Serbia.
[00:33:13.464 --> 00:33:16.186]  And I'm not defending the government of Slobodan Milošević.
[00:33:17.127 --> 00:33:19.949]  But compared to the Albanians, the guy was a saint.
[00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:24.533]  Compared to the other groups around them, I mean, it's tribal warfare.
[00:33:24.993 --> 00:33:29.297]  They've been killing each other for, oh man, I mean, how many years?
[00:33:30.238 --> 00:33:32.079]  Something like 800, 900 years.
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:35.502]  And the Serbs did defend America in World War II.
[00:33:36.747 --> 00:33:40.089]  They did save Madeleine Albright's hind end from the Nazis, and what did they get?
[00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:47.753]  And Al-Qaeda, this is admitted, Bill Clinton gave them $45 million, just like the British gave them money to try to kill Gaddafi.
[00:33:48.233 --> 00:33:53.476]  They worked for the CIA, they started blowing up school buses, they mainly targeted schools, they'd blow up school buses.
[00:33:54.016 --> 00:34:02.021]  After they blew up the 10th or 11th bus, and then went into a school and shot a bunch of people, under CIA control and intelligence,
[00:34:03.051 --> 00:34:04.812]  The Serbs went absolutely ape.
[00:34:04.952 --> 00:34:06.973]  People started threatening to remove Milosevic.
[00:34:07.253 --> 00:34:12.295]  He knew it was a shut-up if he didn't invade and kick out the Albanian Muslim minority.
[00:34:13.015 --> 00:34:20.679]  Oh, see, I thought the Muslims were all evil folks, but oh, when it's Pinak and Bill Clinton and the neocons were all for it, oh, then it's good, they're good!
[00:34:20.939 --> 00:34:22.179]  They're good!
[00:34:22.259 --> 00:34:24.881]  I had David Shaler, MI5, on last week.
[00:34:25.841 --> 00:34:30.323]  We're going to be re-airing that, by the way, on 4th of July, that interview and several other good interviews.
[00:34:31.198 --> 00:34:33.299]  Take the day off, go shoot some fireworks off by the river.
[00:34:35.039 --> 00:34:37.520]  Maybe I'll, uh, go out by the lake and do it, I don't know.
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:38.440]  But, anyway, side issue.
[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:40.201]  We'll be re-airing that.
[00:34:40.941 --> 00:34:49.484]  But, um, you know, uh, Kennedy's reason that the war's good is, well, Kerry was for it.
[00:34:50.564 --> 00:34:52.744]  Well, yeah, Kerry's a member of Skull and Bones.
[00:34:53.265 --> 00:34:54.265]  Kerry's a globalist.
[00:34:55.367 --> 00:34:56.648]  Kerry and Bush are cousins.
[00:34:57.408 --> 00:35:00.710]  It's again, it's like Bill Clinton vacationing with the Bushes.
[00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:04.091]  These people work together, they vacation together, they intermarry.
[00:35:04.391 --> 00:35:05.192]  It's a joke!
[00:35:05.292 --> 00:35:08.273]  Again, the best example, Mary Madeline and Carvel.
[00:35:09.054 --> 00:35:10.635]  They just work both sides of it.
[00:35:11.015 --> 00:35:11.855]  It's a big joke.
[00:35:11.915 --> 00:35:13.656]  They go home and sleep in the same bed.
[00:35:15.177 --> 00:35:16.337]  It's always been the same.
[00:35:16.437 --> 00:35:17.458]  It's staged.
[00:35:17.898 --> 00:35:19.239]  You haven't figured that out yet.
[00:35:19.919 --> 00:35:21.560]  And you say staged.
[00:35:23.479 --> 00:35:27.000]  And now the Democrats want to retroactively act like they weren't involved in all this.
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:29.581]  They were up to it, up to their eyeballs in it.
[00:35:30.762 --> 00:35:32.663]  We all knew it was fake before the war.
[00:35:33.343 --> 00:35:34.303]  Everybody talked about it.
[00:35:34.323 --> 00:35:34.923]  Everybody knew.
[00:35:34.943 --> 00:35:37.044]  I remember being, again, debating people on the radio.
[00:35:37.704 --> 00:35:38.745]  Oh, there's no PNAC.
[00:35:38.785 --> 00:35:40.606]  No, Bush never said he wanted to invade.
[00:35:40.626 --> 00:35:42.806]  Alright, we're about to go to Carlos and others.
[00:35:42.826 --> 00:35:47.228]  Before I do that, just briefly, I have made twelve films.
[00:35:47.248 --> 00:35:48.349]  The twelfth film is out.
[00:35:49.109 --> 00:35:51.910]  Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State.
[00:35:52.643 --> 00:35:54.004]  It is my crowning achievement.
[00:35:54.024 --> 00:35:56.925]  You can get it as low as $14 when you get multiple copies of it.
[00:35:58.086 --> 00:36:00.467]  Your purchase also makes this broadcast possible.
[00:36:01.067 --> 00:36:02.668]  It could do so much more with more support.
[00:36:02.688 --> 00:36:03.428]  We need your support.
[00:36:03.808 --> 00:36:10.211]  But folks, it really is the creme de la creme of truth-seeking, patriot documentaries.
[00:36:10.672 --> 00:36:16.154]  That's the unanimous reviews that are coming in by other documentary makers, other talk show hosts.
[00:36:16.594 --> 00:36:20.016]  A very well-known Hollywood director got a copy of it and told me this is incredible work.
[00:36:21.357 --> 00:36:23.158]  I didn't even seek out that comment, by the way.
[00:36:25.078 --> 00:36:27.479]  Some other people you might know of have mentioned their names.
[00:36:27.599 --> 00:36:33.080]  Let's just say the biggest actor right now in Hollywood just got about 20-something copies of it.
[00:36:34.161 --> 00:36:37.001]  So, the point is, it's a good video.
[00:36:37.021 --> 00:36:38.002]  It's waking people up.
[00:36:38.602 --> 00:36:40.382]  Shattering the left-right paradigm.
[00:36:40.662 --> 00:36:44.783]  It gets into the police state, 9-11, who the globalists are, how they're into the occult.
[00:36:45.404 --> 00:36:46.344]  It is powerful.
[00:36:46.384 --> 00:36:50.105]  It's like Eyes Wide Shut meets Enemy of the State.
[00:36:51.818 --> 00:36:55.000]  Uh, meets, uh, you know, uh, Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:56.841]  You gotta get this film.
[00:36:57.041 --> 00:37:00.423]  Plus, I've got eleven other films and a bunch of other great videos I carry.
[00:37:00.463 --> 00:37:07.027]  Jews to Preservation of Firearms Ownerships, great Second Amendment video that comes with three, three booklets when you order a copy on DVD or VHS.
[00:37:07.448 --> 00:37:10.209]  Uh, we have the USS Liberty video put out by Howard Films.
[00:37:10.649 --> 00:37:16.353]  You want the real story on that of another government-sponsored terror event as a pretext to attack Egypt, you need this video.
[00:37:17.614 --> 00:37:23.680]  We got discounts as low as $5.95 per film, full-length feature films, when you order multiple copies.
[00:37:24.601 --> 00:37:31.729]  So go to InfoWars.com to order via the safe, secure online shopping cart, or call toll-free to order.
[00:37:32.705 --> 00:37:33.245]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:37:33.265 --> 00:37:36.486]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:37:37.306 --> 00:37:44.328]  Or order via Infowars.com.
[00:37:44.708 --> 00:37:48.509]  Look at all the different specials, watch video clips, or go to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:37:49.649 --> 00:37:53.230]  My weekly TV reports, most weeks two or three reports, always one report.
[00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:55.930]  Always timely, always powerful.
[00:37:56.551 --> 00:37:57.871]  All my best audio interviews.
[00:37:58.783 --> 00:38:05.024]  All of my films, dozens of other films, a bunch of e-books, my book, Paul Watson's book, special text reports just for members.
[00:38:05.604 --> 00:38:06.685]  It's ridiculous!
[00:38:07.605 --> 00:38:11.405]  Now into our 14th month of operating PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:38:12.726 --> 00:38:17.787]  So go to PrisonPlanet.tv or InfoWars.com and take action today, folks.
[00:38:18.287 --> 00:38:20.167]  Alright, thank you for holding.
[00:38:20.247 --> 00:38:21.627]  Now we're going to take calls quickly.
[00:38:22.027 --> 00:38:23.348]  Carlos listening on.
[00:38:23.368 --> 00:38:24.848]  You know, we've had stations
[00:38:25.814 --> 00:38:26.975]  And I used to do this in the past.
[00:38:27.035 --> 00:38:27.915]  We don't screen calls.
[00:38:27.975 --> 00:38:30.236]  We ask what your name is, where you're calling from.
[00:38:32.017 --> 00:38:33.998]  But we really should ask how you're listening.
[00:38:34.478 --> 00:38:36.039]  So we can thank all these affiliates.
[00:38:36.799 --> 00:38:38.220]  And he's listening on KCAA.
[00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:39.820]  Been carrying us for about two years.
[00:38:40.941 --> 00:38:45.123]  AM 1050 covers a lot of LA and much of San Diego out of Loma Linda.
[00:38:45.743 --> 00:38:47.084]  What a wonderful station!
[00:38:47.524 --> 00:38:50.405]  We're reaching millions of people through that one affiliate.
[00:38:50.945 --> 00:38:53.506]  One of dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens.
[00:38:53.546 --> 00:38:54.607]  We are growing folks.
[00:38:55.276 --> 00:38:58.298]  We're on, what, three hours a day on two stations in Chicago.
[00:38:58.858 --> 00:39:00.599]  Let's go ahead and go to Carlos.
[00:39:00.639 --> 00:39:01.379]  Carlos, go ahead.
[00:39:01.399 --> 00:39:03.400]  Hi, Alex.
[00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:09.083]  You know, you're so right when you mentioned that people should study a little bit of our history.
[00:39:09.163 --> 00:39:13.806]  If they did, they would have a sense of what trouble we're in right now.
[00:39:14.586 --> 00:39:24.211]  Every war we have fought historically, the last 200 years, going back to the War of 1812, has been manufactured by the financial elite
[00:39:24.924 --> 00:39:29.766]  And they're all a piece-by-piece process leading to a world police state.
[00:39:30.146 --> 00:39:40.170]  The war in 1812, the Civil War, were fought mainly, the main issue was the introduction of a central bank by which the international bankers could control our economy.
[00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:44.752]  And we heard the First World War, that was about the League of Nations.
[00:39:44.992 --> 00:39:49.954]  Colonel Jackson, who later became President 15-12 years later, he said it was about that.
[00:39:50.848 --> 00:39:52.790]  Exactly, and I think they shot him for that.
[00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:55.051]  Well, they tried to kill him a whole bunch of times.
[00:39:55.472 --> 00:39:56.032]  Exactly.
[00:39:56.052 --> 00:39:59.014]  There were seven public attempts on his life.
[00:39:59.995 --> 00:40:02.697]  And there were other attempts on other people also.
[00:40:02.757 --> 00:40:05.399]  McKinley, of course, Lincoln got killed.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:09.783]  Other congressmen have gotten in trouble for pointing the fingers at the Federal Reserve Board.
[00:40:10.613 --> 00:40:30.248]  Uh, Congressman McFadden, Congressman Patman, of course they ostracized McCarthy, but you know, then we have the First World War, the League of Nations, Second World War, the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, all these instruments control the world economies and spread chaos, economic chaos throughout the world.
[00:40:30.488 --> 00:40:34.231]  Then you got Vietnam where they divided us more, and now we got Iraq.
[00:40:34.531 --> 00:40:36.471]  Which is leading us to the Third World War.
[00:40:36.531 --> 00:40:38.692]  This war is going to spread all over the Middle East.
[00:40:39.092 --> 00:40:43.573]  And that's the PENAC plan, and you notice that Rangel kept saying international, international.
[00:40:43.813 --> 00:40:48.534]  We had Rangel on about a month ago, or less than a month ago, and his answer is what I said it would be before the war.
[00:40:48.834 --> 00:40:53.495]  We're going to be made to look like fools, make the UN look good, and you're going to have an international force come in there.
[00:40:54.735 --> 00:41:02.357]  Exactly, you know, Sharal was here recently visiting Bush, and there are current scholars that claim that he was trying to influence Bush
[00:41:04.045 --> 00:41:06.746]  To push the war in Iraq, because they need to get into Iran.
[00:41:06.886 --> 00:41:07.926]  There's no debating it.
[00:41:08.126 --> 00:41:11.068]  He brought all these maps and photos and said, I want you to attack them.
[00:41:11.808 --> 00:41:13.349]  Of course, then we're going to go into Africa.
[00:41:13.369 --> 00:41:23.514]  And right now, something that scares me very much, in South America, you've got the Marxist nations, Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil, Cuba, Mexico.
[00:41:24.241 --> 00:41:35.124]  Starting to align themselves, and they had a meeting recently with Red China, Russia, and some of the Arab nations, and I think they're planning to form another front against us.
[00:41:35.424 --> 00:41:37.965]  So we're going to be involved with several fronts simultaneously.
[00:41:37.985 --> 00:41:41.806]  And let's be clear, that front is controlled out of Washington and London.
[00:41:42.626 --> 00:41:43.187]  Exactly!
[00:41:43.487 --> 00:41:48.688]  You know, I mean, why did our government not even try to keep the lease on the Panama Canal?
[00:41:48.708 --> 00:41:51.069]  They just gave it to the Communist government.
[00:41:51.624 --> 00:41:53.125]  Well, you know how hypocritical it is!
[00:41:53.806 --> 00:42:14.340]  The Marxist guy from Venezuela, Chavez, the Marxist guy from Colombo, Uribe, the Marxist guy from Brazil, I forget his name, Feyla, or whatever his name is, all those people visited the Council on Foreign Relations three years ago, in a span of three months, and the members of the International Monetary Fund were there, the World Bank, and guess what?
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.842]  I'm sure they got their hands on the money!
[00:42:17.102 --> 00:42:18.363]  And there's no debating it!
[00:42:19.849 --> 00:42:24.252]  We know, we have the IMF World Bank documents, Joseph Siklis, their chief economist, went public.
[00:42:24.592 --> 00:42:27.934]  They talk about creating riots, blowing out economies.
[00:42:28.334 --> 00:42:29.815]  This is their plan, folks.
[00:42:30.035 --> 00:42:31.055]  They're not there to help you.
[00:42:32.336 --> 00:42:34.797]  Of course Alex, look what happened in Bolivia recently.
[00:42:36.318 --> 00:42:44.602]  The people rebelled, mainly because they found out that the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank were imposing as a pay-off for the low $90,000.
[00:42:44.642 --> 00:42:45.183]  Same thing in Brazil.
[00:42:48.428 --> 00:42:48.828]  Exactly.
[00:42:48.848 --> 00:42:51.490]  90 cents on the dollar to pay off the loans.
[00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:53.290]  How are people going to live?
[00:42:53.831 --> 00:43:01.174]  And how is the money going to be used to upgrade their economies if 90 cents on the dollar... Well, by the way, most of these IMF loans are at about 25 to 32 percent.
[00:43:01.354 --> 00:43:02.375]  That's loan sharking.
[00:43:02.415 --> 00:43:03.335]  That's almost illegal.
[00:43:04.456 --> 00:43:08.798]  Well, and that tells you the essence of these institutions which were created by the Second World War.
[00:43:09.098 --> 00:43:11.079]  And again, where do these institutions get their money?
[00:43:11.219 --> 00:43:13.060]  Off of these central bank printing presses.
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:14.280]  They make it out of nothing.
[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:15.781]  It's backed up by military.
[00:43:16.542 --> 00:43:22.345]  And then we got Thomas Barnett, the professor at the Naval War College, saying the military works for the banks.
[00:43:23.306 --> 00:43:28.349]  And now we got the new conservative, Waffle Whip, who pushed the war in the Middle East.
[00:43:28.369 --> 00:43:29.650]  Now he's head of the World Bank.
[00:43:31.651 --> 00:43:32.611]  How is that a laugh?
[00:43:32.711 --> 00:43:33.892]  It's disgusting, Carlos.
[00:43:33.912 --> 00:43:34.552]  Good to hear from you.
[00:43:34.572 --> 00:43:35.753]  I'd love to keep you on for an hour.
[00:43:35.793 --> 00:43:40.696]  You're very intelligent and make point after point in a Blitzkrieg fashion, but we've got to move on.
[00:43:41.454 --> 00:43:42.855]  He's absolutely right, folks.
[00:43:43.436 --> 00:43:44.297]  He knows his stuff.
[00:43:44.757 --> 00:43:45.798]  Bart, in Texas.
[00:43:45.838 --> 00:43:46.499]  Go ahead, Bart.
[00:43:47.820 --> 00:44:00.712]  Alex, Addie Wiseman, Houston City Council member of District E, has begun the process to end free speech here in Houston by leading the assault to destroy public access.
[00:44:01.632 --> 00:44:05.376]  I'm putting the call out to all Houstonians that listen to your show.
[00:44:05.416 --> 00:44:07.017]  Well, tell me what Addie Wiseman's doing.
[00:44:07.037 --> 00:44:07.738]  I mean, tell me about it.
[00:44:08.263 --> 00:44:18.689]  Well, what she's doing is she saw something that she disagreed with on Public Access, and now she's calling for... Well, I'm on Public, uh... You talking about Houston Media Source?
[00:44:19.149 --> 00:44:19.589]  Yes, sir.
[00:44:19.769 --> 00:44:21.310]  I'm on that every day, aren't I?
[00:44:22.211 --> 00:44:22.911]  Yes, you are.
[00:44:24.132 --> 00:44:25.032]  You're on all the time.
[00:44:25.873 --> 00:44:27.714]  Is that what she saw she didn't like?
[00:44:28.194 --> 00:44:37.399]  No, she saw some... She evidently couldn't sleep one night and saw some transvestite show because we have a very active gay community in Houston.
[00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:40.171]  This is how censorship works.
[00:44:40.231 --> 00:44:45.973]  They'll use something like that to get me off the air, and if you take their free speech, then everybody loses it.
[00:44:46.594 --> 00:44:48.074]  Of course, that's always the process.
[00:44:48.154 --> 00:45:04.641]  What she's proposing right now is either to bring public access under government control by having a committee that the city would form to decide what is palatable for the people, or to just do away with public access altogether by ceasing the city's funding of it.
[00:45:07.148 --> 00:45:07.388]  Hello?
[00:45:07.708 --> 00:45:11.191]  And what's the name of the, uh, Pat something, what's the name of the director down there?
[00:45:11.611 --> 00:45:12.452]  Pat Garlinghouse.
[00:45:13.032 --> 00:45:13.232]  Yeah.
[00:45:13.532 --> 00:45:15.394]  What is Pat Garlinghouse doing about this?
[00:45:15.954 --> 00:45:22.258]  Well, she was on, they had a report... Go ahead, Bart, you're on the air.
[00:45:23.959 --> 00:45:26.761]  We didn't hang up on Bart, his cell phone or something cut out.
[00:45:28.742 --> 00:45:29.323]  Ah, he's gone.
[00:45:29.343 --> 00:45:30.984]  If you can get back in, you're welcome, sir.
[00:45:31.184 --> 00:45:36.808]  Uh, look, all over the country, I mean, you have mild stuff that I don't agree with and I think is stupid or bad, but
[00:45:37.523 --> 00:45:38.563]  On access late at night.
[00:45:39.344 --> 00:45:42.204]  But you'll flip over, you know, to the next cable channel.
[00:45:42.305 --> 00:45:56.949]  They're stuck at 9 o'clock at night on the cable channels and on broadcast TV, you know, people mutilating themselves, eating, drinking pig blood, uh, men in bed together, and then you'll see what's on access and it's not one half as extreme.
[00:45:57.249 --> 00:46:00.470]  And oh, we gotta shut it down, we gotta shut... You know what?
[00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:02.171]  Our children don't watch television.
[00:46:02.731 --> 00:46:05.031]  So if you don't like what's on TV, you should turn it off.
[00:46:05.772 --> 00:46:06.772]  Or control what's on it.
[00:46:07.974 --> 00:46:09.854]  But, yeah, that's the problem with censorship.
[00:46:09.874 --> 00:46:13.395]  You know, I hear the neocons, yeah, arrest all the anti-Bush protesters.
[00:46:13.655 --> 00:46:14.716]  Don't allow them to protest.
[00:46:14.756 --> 00:46:20.877]  And then the left's like, yeah, and arrest all the people that are anti-immigrant, or arrest the people that are white supremacist.
[00:46:21.117 --> 00:46:24.438]  Look, I don't agree with the white supremacist, or the black supremacist, or Meche, or La Raza.
[00:46:25.518 --> 00:46:29.439]  But I believe in the Ku Klux Klan's right to say whatever they want about black people.
[00:46:29.779 --> 00:46:32.819]  And I have my right to say they're a bunch of white trash fools.
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:35.200]  Okay?
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:36.100]  I mean, it's that simple.
[00:46:37.288 --> 00:46:42.250]  So you take somebody else's right, folks, you're going to lose your right.
[00:46:42.830 --> 00:46:45.811]  So stop trying to regulate everybody's speech.
[00:46:45.851 --> 00:46:47.952]  That goes for everybody across the political spectrum.
[00:46:48.412 --> 00:46:49.972]  Because all you're going to do is lose your speech.
[00:46:50.473 --> 00:46:53.033]  If you don't like what's on TV, believe me, I don't like what's on it.
[00:46:53.514 --> 00:46:54.194]  I'm on TV.
[00:46:54.234 --> 00:46:55.574]  I don't watch hardly any TV.
[00:46:55.794 --> 00:46:56.735]  I mean, it's ridiculous, folks.
[00:46:56.775 --> 00:46:57.615]  I probably watch now
[00:46:59.404 --> 00:47:00.466]  Maybe 20 minutes a week.
[00:47:00.906 --> 00:47:02.468]  I mean, I really don't watch television.
[00:47:02.609 --> 00:47:03.049]  I love it.
[00:47:03.089 --> 00:47:03.770]  My life's great.
[00:47:03.850 --> 00:47:06.554]  I mean, I remember I used to spend hours a day watching, and I'd get so mad.
[00:47:06.974 --> 00:47:10.138]  I can read the synopsis of what's on all the TV shows without watching it.
[00:47:10.499 --> 00:47:13.603]  People do send me select clips and videotapes, and I do watch those.
[00:47:14.389 --> 00:47:23.734]  That more is, you know, in a research pattern, you know, sitting in a studio, watching it, focusing on the propaganda, remaining totally conscious, knowing I'm being propagandized.
[00:47:24.074 --> 00:47:30.958]  But no, you just sit there, pop a brew, lean back, suspend disbelief, and your subconscious is just bombarded.
[00:47:31.378 --> 00:47:32.419]  The major studies are out.
[00:47:32.479 --> 00:47:35.661]  Your brain takes what it sees on television as real.
[00:47:35.721 --> 00:47:39.423]  It is very dangerous and very powerful.
[00:47:39.483 --> 00:47:41.464]  We use television with these films.
[00:47:41.504 --> 00:47:42.544]  That's why they're so effective.
[00:47:42.864 --> 00:47:43.845]  But we use the truth.
[00:47:44.773 --> 00:47:50.198]  And then it can be very powerful, but man, with the lies, it is dangerous.
[00:47:50.258 --> 00:47:51.238]  Cindy in Delaware.
[00:47:51.298 --> 00:47:52.019]  Cindy, go ahead.
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:55.222]  It's an honor to talk to a great patriot.
[00:47:55.262 --> 00:47:56.343]  I've got to get that out first.
[00:47:56.583 --> 00:47:57.684]  Well, it's an honor to talk to you.
[00:47:57.724 --> 00:47:58.905]  What's on your mind?
[00:47:59.025 --> 00:48:03.929]  I'm a regular caller at my local radio station here in Wilmington, Delaware.
[00:48:04.489 --> 00:48:11.535]  And I called the other day, and they were talking about the terrorists in Iraq, how horrible they are, and we have to keep fighting them.
[00:48:12.108 --> 00:48:18.231]  I called up and I said, you know, the biggest terrorists are in the White House, and they're traitors to our country.
[00:48:18.952 --> 00:48:22.254]  And the talk show host asked me, well, what are you supposed to do about that?
[00:48:22.334 --> 00:48:23.754]  And I said, well, you get a long rope.
[00:48:24.315 --> 00:48:24.975]  Well, guess what?
[00:48:26.516 --> 00:48:37.422]  Secret Service was down to the radio station, because supposedly someone called them and reported it, and I had to be interviewed and assessed by them as to what kind of a threat I am.
[00:48:38.322 --> 00:48:39.663]  Well, ma'am, I would warn you...
[00:48:41.949 --> 00:48:55.595]  Let me just tell you, I've advised the listeners over and over again, a lot of other people, other networks, other people shoot their mouths off, and I'm not being mean to you, and say this stuff, and it is very serious, and you don't ever want to talk like that.
[00:48:55.675 --> 00:48:59.857]  Number one, we don't want anything to happen to George Bush or Dick Cheney.
[00:49:01.277 --> 00:49:07.600]  We want them to be indicted by a grand jury, and to be brought up on charges, and to be tried by a jury of their peers.
[00:49:08.494 --> 00:49:10.295]  And at the same time, they're just puppets.
[00:49:10.315 --> 00:49:14.696]  If anything bad happened to them, it would be used as great propaganda for the New World Order.
[00:49:14.936 --> 00:49:17.577]  I want to guard President Bush's life.
[00:49:17.617 --> 00:49:20.858]  Listen, we got a very serious threat against the President one time.
[00:49:21.439 --> 00:49:25.600]  Someone saying, you know, they were going to carry out violence, and I called the Secret Service.
[00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:27.681]  Now, why did I call the Secret Service?
[00:49:27.721 --> 00:49:29.501]  Well, number one, I thought it was a setup.
[00:49:30.182 --> 00:49:31.442]  I thought I was being set up.
[00:49:31.482 --> 00:49:35.043]  It turned out it was a mentally ill person, and he admitted to all of it.
[00:49:35.103 --> 00:49:36.324]  It was put in a mental institution.
[00:49:37.189 --> 00:49:41.071]  That was in the newspapers in Tennessee, but I know you were saying that figuratively.
[00:49:41.091 --> 00:49:43.112]  It was off the cuff, you know.
[00:49:43.192 --> 00:49:45.494]  I know you didn't mean it, you know, it's the classical thing.
[00:49:45.934 --> 00:49:50.556]  It sounds like a founding father quote, but the point is, we gotta be smarter than that.
[00:49:50.976 --> 00:49:52.497]  We can't shoot our mouths off.
[00:49:54.178 --> 00:49:55.759]  But I mean, I take it they don't think you're a threat.
[00:49:56.701 --> 00:49:57.121]  Oh, no!
[00:49:57.222 --> 00:49:57.722]  My God, no!
[00:49:57.742 --> 00:50:00.204]  Did they ask you how much you counted?
[00:50:00.224 --> 00:50:02.306]  Number one, number one, you got the Fifth Amendment.
[00:50:02.386 --> 00:50:03.767]  I just said, look, I didn't say that.
[00:50:04.288 --> 00:50:05.449]  How did they know who you were?
[00:50:05.469 --> 00:50:10.433]  Um, because when they went down to the radio station, the host of the show knows me.
[00:50:10.493 --> 00:50:13.295]  I gave him your Masters of Terror video tape before.
[00:50:13.776 --> 00:50:16.798]  So he knows who I am and he knows my face.
[00:50:16.859 --> 00:50:18.440]  I have nothing to hide out.
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:20.702]  I bet money the station's the ones that called them on you.
[00:50:21.818 --> 00:50:26.840]  Oh, well, you know, it's interesting because that radio station's been taken over about a year ago by Clear Channel.
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:32.162]  Well, really, in a way, if they knew you, they had a responsibility or they could have gotten in trouble.
[00:50:32.182 --> 00:50:34.123]  Look, we've got to be careful about this.
[00:50:34.603 --> 00:50:37.304]  The Secret Service is a criminal organization.
[00:50:38.724 --> 00:50:45.367]  I'm not saying they're criminal, all the members, the officers, the agents, but, uh, I mean, listen, the Secret Service?
[00:50:46.767 --> 00:50:49.188]  Yeah, I just want to give everybody a heads up about it.
[00:50:49.728 --> 00:50:50.789]  I'm not a threat to anyone.
[00:50:50.829 --> 00:50:53.710]  I'll tell you how you can tell people are agents.
[00:50:54.370 --> 00:50:55.971]  See, you're not an agent, so you've got to visit.
[00:50:56.071 --> 00:50:58.692]  I know agents on the radio that shoot their mouths off.
[00:50:59.012 --> 00:50:59.792]  Nothing ever happens.
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:02.841]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.041 --> 00:51:06.124]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.244 --> 00:51:10.146]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.186 --> 00:51:14.450]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:18.552]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:18.633 --> 00:51:20.494]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:20.774 --> 00:51:23.997]  Reliant police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:51:24.037 --> 00:51:28.741]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:28.921 --> 00:51:31.964]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.144 --> 00:51:35.006]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.487 --> 00:51:41.612]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.132 --> 00:51:45.916]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[00:52:13.803 --> 00:52:18.469]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.

[00:52:26.057 --> 00:52:37.830]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[00:53:00.211 --> 00:53:03.594]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.

[00:54:09.455 --> 00:54:20.483]  Yeah, folks, if you make a threat against the President, and then say even how you're going to do it, and say you're going to carry it out, you'll serve about five years in prison.
[00:54:21.524 --> 00:54:23.085]  It's basically an instant conviction.
[00:54:27.492 --> 00:54:33.733]  I have seen cases of people I just know are provocateurs and paid informants that are on the radio.
[00:54:34.273 --> 00:54:41.655]  In fact, I even have sources and documents on it, but it doesn't do any good to even expose these people because the dumbed-down public won't even understand it.
[00:54:42.755 --> 00:54:48.416]  But they shoot their mouths off about violence and nothing happens to them.
[00:54:48.756 --> 00:54:54.277]  But if you're a nice little lady in Delaware and just flippantly make a joke, it's over for you.
[00:54:55.407 --> 00:54:56.367]  So, listen.
[00:54:56.567 --> 00:54:58.028]  That's why, you know, I get criticized.
[00:54:58.468 --> 00:55:00.128]  Alex doesn't call for violence.
[00:55:00.248 --> 00:55:01.729]  Alex isn't a real man.
[00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:04.210]  Well, you know the old song.
[00:55:04.250 --> 00:55:06.250]  You've got to know when to hold them.
[00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:08.511]  Know when to fold them.
[00:55:08.891 --> 00:55:10.331]  Know when to walk away.
[00:55:10.371 --> 00:55:11.532]  Know when to run.
[00:55:11.972 --> 00:55:14.293]  You never count your money when you're sitting at the table.
[00:55:14.713 --> 00:55:18.054]  There'll be time enough for counting when the dealing's done.
[00:55:18.074 --> 00:55:19.954]  Uh, seriously.
[00:55:21.815 --> 00:55:22.135]  Folks.
[00:55:25.342 --> 00:55:25.822]  You do not.
[00:55:26.423 --> 00:55:29.685]  In this fight, the pen is mightier than the sword.
[00:55:29.725 --> 00:55:36.811]  The Pentagon says that propaganda is their most powerful asset.
[00:55:38.832 --> 00:55:41.234]  It's what the great game is all about.
[00:55:41.314 --> 00:55:44.336]  And we have the truth, they have the lies, they have more media power.
[00:55:44.376 --> 00:55:46.178]  For a limited time, they're losing it than we do.
[00:55:46.218 --> 00:55:50.241]  But once you show somebody how they're being lied to, then all the lies in the world don't work.
[00:55:51.539 --> 00:55:53.320]  The globalists bombed Oklahoma City.
[00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:55.061]  They bombed the World Trade Center in 93.
[00:55:55.301 --> 00:56:00.585]  They carried out the attacks on 9-11 as a way to escalate the violence and have a pretext to take our freedoms.
[00:56:02.105 --> 00:56:04.227]  The last thing we want is violence.
[00:56:04.267 --> 00:56:07.809]  Folks, I saw the militia movement in the 90s destroyed by Feds.
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:14.443]  And they'd openly have a militia meeting of 50 people, and 10 of them there were feds, and it all came out in newspapers.
[00:56:14.864 --> 00:56:17.745]  They would shoot their mouths off about violence just over and over again.
[00:56:18.005 --> 00:56:19.146]  We gotta do something violent.
[00:56:19.166 --> 00:56:19.927]  We gotta do something.
[00:56:19.947 --> 00:56:21.047]  We gotta kill people.
[00:56:21.507 --> 00:56:24.689]  And one good old boy would go, yeah, I agree with you, Bob.
[00:56:24.709 --> 00:56:26.991]  He was slurping his cure's light.
[00:56:29.012 --> 00:56:29.812]  And it was over.
[00:56:29.852 --> 00:56:30.713]  They were being recorded.
[00:56:30.773 --> 00:56:33.354]  And it didn't matter if it was the feds in there provocateuring it.
[00:56:33.374 --> 00:56:35.155]  Somebody just shot their mouth off.
[00:56:36.556 --> 00:56:37.857]  So they'd go to jail for 10 years.
[00:56:40.538 --> 00:56:43.801]  So, uh, that's why I'm not involved with the militia movement, folks.
[00:56:45.863 --> 00:56:47.764]  I mean, I won't touch it with a ten-foot pole.
[00:56:48.305 --> 00:56:49.266]  We're all in the militia.
[00:56:49.406 --> 00:56:50.467]  All men in this country are.
[00:56:50.527 --> 00:56:51.648]  We're here to defend the nation.
[00:56:51.668 --> 00:56:53.329]  What do you think the men in it are?
[00:56:53.349 --> 00:56:57.113]  You know, I mean, if I see people robbing an old lady, I'm gonna go help her.
[00:56:57.153 --> 00:56:58.094]  That's what the militia does.
[00:56:58.434 --> 00:57:04.780]  If I see a cop stuck in a car, run off a bridge, I'm gonna jump in and try to help the cop, or the civilian, as they call us.
[00:57:06.641 --> 00:57:07.522]  You know, it's just that simple.
[00:57:08.958 --> 00:57:14.483]  I mean, you know, the band of banditos was coming down your street, you know, robbing and killing, and people come out and defend.
[00:57:14.903 --> 00:57:16.284]  That's what civil defense does.
[00:57:17.405 --> 00:57:21.189]  It isn't about being all clandestine and hiding out in the woods and being all paranoid.
[00:57:21.209 --> 00:57:24.311]  It's about wearing a suit and tie and being up before the city council.
[00:57:25.472 --> 00:57:26.493]  We're the good guys, folks.
[00:57:26.513 --> 00:57:27.414]  We wear the white hats.
[00:57:27.474 --> 00:57:30.376]  We're not slinking around like the guys in the black hats.
[00:57:30.416 --> 00:57:31.157]  We're out in the open.
[00:57:33.491 --> 00:57:38.675]  Anybody that tells you to hide out and be all secret, and that's the way to do it, man, they feed on you that way.
[00:57:38.715 --> 00:57:42.598]  They run in fear because they know that you know they're criminals when you're out in the open.
[00:57:42.899 --> 00:57:44.880]  Look, I've been doing this really for 12 years.
[00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:46.782]  I keep saying 10 years, but two more years has gone by.
[00:57:47.002 --> 00:57:47.922]  Really about 12 years.
[00:57:49.284 --> 00:57:58.711]  I remember early on, man, I'd be at a city council meeting calling in to fight some land grabbing, and I'd be walking out to my car, and a guy would walk over and go, Alex, we ought to kill people.
[00:57:59.795 --> 00:58:00.656]  And I'd go, no way!
[00:58:00.716 --> 00:58:01.116]  No way!
[00:58:01.176 --> 00:58:01.677]  I'm up for that!
[00:58:01.697 --> 00:58:05.860]  And then I'd watch him, I'd pull around the block and watch them leave and it'd be a unmarked cop car!
[00:58:06.681 --> 00:58:07.581]  I was like, man!
[00:58:08.062 --> 00:58:08.342]  Whoa!
[00:58:08.382 --> 00:58:11.124]  They're trying to set me up just because I'm... But it's big business!
[00:58:11.605 --> 00:58:16.609]  Hundreds of millions of dollars that I was about to take from them by getting people rallied against land grabbing!
[00:58:16.929 --> 00:58:18.370]  That was before I even had a TV show!
[00:58:20.632 --> 00:58:22.333]  And so they got corrupt cops on the force.
[00:58:22.353 --> 00:58:27.478]  They're not all corrupt, but they direct one of their little intelligence squad people out to try to get me to say something.
[00:58:27.518 --> 00:58:27.698]  I mean,
[00:58:29.665 --> 00:58:32.647]  Folks, I've been living this for a long time.
[00:58:32.667 --> 00:58:33.708]  We're going to break here in a second.
[00:58:33.748 --> 00:58:37.430]  We'll be right back with the second hour.
[00:58:37.610 --> 00:58:37.990]  Stay with us.
[00:58:57.465 --> 00:58:58.085]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.766 --> 00:58:59.807]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.527 --> 00:59:01.628]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.268 --> 00:59:03.129]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.850 --> 00:59:04.790]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.810 --> 00:59:09.253]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.614 --> 00:59:13.757]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.619 --> 00:59:22.343]  Fancy gang bill and dangerous gun rights to give us an update on the state of the Second Amendment.
[00:59:23.095 --> 00:59:29.541]  The premier organization's leader will be joining us, Larry Pratt of GOA, coming up in the next segment.
[00:59:29.601 --> 00:59:33.385]  A massive news on the economy, on Iraq, on government propaganda.
[00:59:33.405 --> 00:59:36.428]  It's a big broadcast lined up in the next two hours.
[00:59:36.468 --> 00:59:39.231]  I was about to go to Justin in Texas, but he just hung up.
[00:59:40.852 --> 00:59:43.315]  So we'll go to Jeff in Texas.
[00:59:44.193 --> 00:59:45.034]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[00:59:45.074 --> 00:59:45.494]  Go ahead.
[00:59:45.934 --> 00:59:46.675]  Yeah, Alex, hi.
[00:59:46.715 --> 00:59:47.816]  Thanks for waking me up.
[00:59:47.836 --> 00:59:49.136]  Hey, listen, I need your help.
[00:59:49.236 --> 00:59:53.639]  I'm trying to shake somebody up close to me that just is in denial.
[00:59:53.679 --> 00:59:54.540]  Don't waste your time.
[00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:55.481]  There's the help.
[00:59:55.641 --> 00:59:56.721]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:59:56.761 --> 00:59:57.322]  There's the help.
[00:59:57.982 --> 00:59:59.603]  The person close to you doesn't want to wake up?
[00:59:59.824 --> 01:00:00.244]  Move on.
[01:00:00.484 --> 01:00:02.165]  How about just a piece of information then?
[01:00:02.605 --> 01:00:10.511]  You mentioned a little while ago that on a couple previous shows that Gloria Steinem admitted she worked for the CIA.
[01:00:10.631 --> 01:00:11.791]  Where is the source for that?
[01:00:12.112 --> 01:00:13.973]  Okay, I don't mean to toot Rush Limbaugh's horn.
[01:00:14.914 --> 01:00:24.542]  But I was just out of high school and college, living with my parents, and I remember driving in the car, I heard Rush Limbaugh go, wow, look at Gloria Steinem's book!
[01:00:24.982 --> 01:00:29.626]  And he, something, Horizons, or something, something to do with Horizons, I forget the name.
[01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:31.751]  And I go, wait, I've seen that book!
[01:00:31.971 --> 01:00:33.172]  My parents are prolific readers.
[01:00:33.672 --> 01:00:54.703]  I go home, pull the book, turn to the page Limbaugh said, and there she was bragging about how she was founded and funded by the CIA, Miss Magazine, and also Mr. McHale with SaveTheMales.ca, he's written about it, and it's well known, but I need to dig that book back out.
[01:00:54.723 --> 01:00:56.484]  I don't remember, because that was like
[01:00:57.478 --> 01:01:00.484]  You know, 16 or not, like 14 years ago or something.
[01:01:01.305 --> 01:01:03.650]  But, uh, yes, she is CIA.
[01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:07.217]  Yeah, the whole feminist foundation rests on her.
[01:01:07.237 --> 01:01:07.858]  That's amazing.
[01:01:09.318 --> 01:01:15.884]  Yeah, well, I mean, we have Carnegie Foundation documents and others, too, about, you know, breaking up the family, getting the women in the workforce so they could pay taxes.
[01:01:16.084 --> 01:01:19.647]  Look, if a woman wants to work or be a CEO or be a rocket scientist, that's fine with me.
[01:01:19.948 --> 01:01:21.149]  The point is, don't force them.
[01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:23.731]  Look at all these women that went and got degrees and made all this money.
[01:01:23.991 --> 01:01:27.114]  Now they're 45, battling and paying a million bucks to try to have kids.
[01:01:27.494 --> 01:01:28.395]  They're totally unhappy.
[01:01:29.176 --> 01:01:31.398]  That's because Lucifer doesn't like Ephesians chapter 5.
[01:01:31.478 --> 01:01:32.959]  He's trying to override it.
[01:01:33.059 --> 01:01:33.600]  So there you go.
[01:01:35.333 --> 01:01:36.334]  Anything else, sir?
[01:01:36.854 --> 01:01:38.635]  Your wife doesn't believe that?
[01:01:39.836 --> 01:01:41.777]  No, that's why I want to get the hard evidence.
[01:01:42.677 --> 01:01:44.478]  Well, yeah, I thought it was a neighbor or something.
[01:01:44.538 --> 01:01:44.939]  Move on.
[01:01:44.959 --> 01:01:45.839]  But yeah, it's your wife.
[01:01:45.859 --> 01:01:46.619]  You've got to wake her up.
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:49.001]  Yeah, an article from Saturday.
[01:01:49.121 --> 01:01:50.902]  Reuters disappeared very quickly.
[01:01:50.922 --> 01:01:53.864]  IRS probing possible data security breaches.
[01:01:54.364 --> 01:01:56.925]  Yeah, a whole bunch of stuff came up missing, yeah.
[01:01:56.965 --> 01:01:58.026]  Look, look, look, look.
[01:01:58.146 --> 01:01:59.647]  Most of the data lost
[01:02:00.385 --> 01:02:05.728]  Most of the... it is government or private companies selling or transferring data.
[01:02:05.768 --> 01:02:06.609]  That's the lion's share.
[01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:08.770]  But the news keeps acting like it's the internet.
[01:02:08.910 --> 01:02:09.431]  It is not.
[01:02:10.912 --> 01:02:16.275]  Do you think that data is going to some place in, say, maybe Brussels?
[01:02:16.355 --> 01:02:18.497]  All that stuff automatically gets uploaded and sold.
[01:02:19.017 --> 01:02:22.699]  So they're just announcing it all now to create fear.
[01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:25.801]  To break down this current financial system and replace it.
[01:02:25.881 --> 01:02:26.402]  Well, no.
[01:02:26.502 --> 01:02:27.802]  Yes, we'll accept biometrics.
[01:02:27.963 --> 01:02:28.503]  Thanks for the call.
[01:02:29.096 --> 01:02:29.636]  Good to hear from you.
[01:02:29.656 --> 01:02:30.376]  Who's up next here?
[01:02:32.617 --> 01:02:33.817]  Megan in Pennsylvania.
[01:02:33.857 --> 01:02:34.557]  Megan, go ahead.
[01:02:34.577 --> 01:02:36.678]  Hi Alex.
[01:02:36.938 --> 01:02:37.198]  Hi.
[01:02:37.538 --> 01:02:37.838]  How are you?
[01:02:38.218 --> 01:02:45.380]  I was just watching, I just spent an hour and a half watching the committee vote discussion on CAFTA and they passed it.
[01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:49.481]  So it now passed out of the House Ways and Means Committee.
[01:02:49.501 --> 01:02:52.002]  So now it's passed out of the committee and the Senate and the House.
[01:02:52.282 --> 01:02:53.062]  Yes.
[01:02:53.162 --> 01:02:55.383]  And it could be up for a vote as early as today.
[01:02:55.939 --> 01:02:57.420]  Today or tomorrow, yeah, it's the latest.
[01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:02.601]  They had left the vote open for a couple people who were absent, but it won't change the effect.
[01:03:02.661 --> 01:03:03.882]  And again, it's like the Supreme Court.
[01:03:03.902 --> 01:03:06.002]  99% of people were against their ruling.
[01:03:06.282 --> 01:03:07.483]  It's totally unconstitutional.
[01:03:07.503 --> 01:03:08.143]  They just did it.
[01:03:08.623 --> 01:03:10.344]  Everybody's against the electronic voting machines.
[01:03:10.364 --> 01:03:10.824]  They just do it.
[01:03:10.844 --> 01:03:12.084]  Everybody's against the transponders.
[01:03:12.124 --> 01:03:12.665]  They just do it.
[01:03:13.085 --> 01:03:14.165]  Everybody's against all this.
[01:03:14.185 --> 01:03:14.825]  They just do it.
[01:03:14.845 --> 01:03:21.848]  Yeah, and they have, you know, some of the no people had some really, you know, good arguments, but, you know, common sense doesn't matter.
[01:03:21.888 --> 01:03:22.468]  I did write down
[01:03:23.012 --> 01:03:27.314]  I checked off, I have a list of everyone who's a member, so I checked off who was a yay and who was a nay.
[01:03:27.414 --> 01:03:28.674]  So, my own.
[01:03:29.655 --> 01:03:31.075]  Well, it's an important issue.
[01:03:31.135 --> 01:03:34.697]  You want to hold and talk about it after Larry Pratt leaves us?
[01:03:34.737 --> 01:03:34.897]  Sure.
[01:03:35.297 --> 01:03:39.759]  Okay, you have to hold a while, but that's what I wanted to get into next when Larry leaves us.
[01:03:39.779 --> 01:03:45.601]  His captain, we'll probably take some calls while Larry Pratt's on with us, if it pertains to the Second Amendment, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:45.661 --> 01:03:46.921]  Larry Pratt, head of GOA, coming up.
[01:03:54.145 --> 01:03:57.006]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.266 --> 01:03:58.846]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.186 --> 01:04:03.867]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.188 --> 01:04:08.629]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:04:09.049 --> 01:04:13.250]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:13.450 --> 01:04:14.070]  The Constitution
[01:04:14.370 --> 01:04:21.035]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:38.127 --> 01:04:43.833]  1-888-253-3139 or visit InfoWars.com and the secure shopping cart.

[01:04:53.855 --> 01:05:02.921]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:05:03.182 --> 01:05:14.409]  Black Ferkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:19.573]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[01:05:19.793 --> 01:05:20.473]  Are no problem.
[01:05:20.694 --> 01:05:27.337]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:27.557 --> 01:05:34.381]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:05:34.661 --> 01:05:36.422]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[01:05:36.682 --> 01:05:38.743]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.

[01:05:41.525 --> 01:05:41.705]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:05:53.771 --> 01:05:55.372]  You've heard it over and over again.
[01:05:55.612 --> 01:05:58.073]  It's not if a catastrophic event will occur, but when.
[01:05:58.413 --> 01:06:02.075]  When are all of our resources, the things we take for granted, going to be pulled out from under us?
[01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:07.217]  When this happens, we're going to have to take care of ourselves and our loved ones with the only resources we already have.
[01:06:07.557 --> 01:06:08.258]  Don't wait for when.
[01:06:08.518 --> 01:06:09.618]  It's important to act now.

[01:06:26.471 --> 01:06:28.793]  Joyce cooked up a meal for the office and it tasted delicious.
[01:06:29.094 --> 01:06:36.240]  Ready Reserve Foods has everything for survival, from kits to shortwave radios, storage containers to non-hybrid garden seats, and so much more.

[01:06:42.146 --> 01:06:42.446]  That's 877-817-9829.
[01:06:42.466 --> 01:06:44.508]  It's better to be a year too early than a day too late.
[01:06:53.889 --> 01:06:55.970]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:56.530 --> 01:06:59.371]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:59.431 --> 01:07:14.456]  Your phone calls will also get into children being tortured at the different U.S.
[01:07:14.536 --> 01:07:15.916]  bases overseas.
[01:07:16.717 --> 01:07:23.259]  And Italy wants to extradite 13 members of the Central Intelligence Agency for kidnapping people and torturing.
[01:07:24.267 --> 01:07:32.333]  And Bush is setting up a domestic spy agency, and it will also deal with the Second Amendment, under the new federally issued state driver's license and ID cards.
[01:07:32.993 --> 01:07:38.297]  The former death squad commander, Negroponte, will be over your domestic intelligence.
[01:07:38.917 --> 01:07:48.124]  They've actually hired, this is mainstream news, former heads of the Stasi and the KGB, who helped them set this up in the last three years, consulting
[01:07:48.746 --> 01:07:55.848]  Folks, if I wrote a Stephen King novel or some other novel, people wouldn't believe something as crazy happening in America.
[01:07:56.668 --> 01:08:08.372]  So here to talk today with us for a couple of segments, we appreciate him coming on, is the head of Gun Owners of America, G-O-N-E-R-S dot O-R-G, is Larry Pratt.
[01:08:09.381 --> 01:08:13.403]  And we're going to get into what the National ID Card is going to do, how we've got to fight the implementation of that.
[01:08:13.883 --> 01:08:17.104]  But the main thing he's on about is anti-gang bill and dangerous gun rights.
[01:08:17.665 --> 01:08:23.427]  Activist claims family of dad using firearm to protect could be jailed.
[01:08:23.447 --> 01:08:29.010]  A national gun rights group is decrying an anti-gangs crime recently passed in the House of Representatives.
[01:08:29.370 --> 01:08:36.453]  Sending a proposal if it becomes law that subject entire families to prison terms if the parent uses a firearm to protect his or her brood.
[01:08:37.361 --> 01:08:39.443]  The disgusting bill, H.R.
[01:08:39.463 --> 01:08:51.314]  1279, and we have Republicans passing this, called the Gang Deterrence and Community Protection Act of 05, passed in the House in late May by a 279-144 vote.
[01:08:52.234 --> 01:08:55.457]  And Larry Pratt is getting into how dangerous this is.
[01:08:55.497 --> 01:08:59.521]  And again, in the name of enforcement, Project Exile and SAFE and all this,
[01:09:00.265 --> 01:09:07.629]  They take federal funds and federally charge you locally for just having a gun in your car because it had one too many bullets in it.
[01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:15.674]  No crime was committed, but because the gun is a crime under some regulation, now you're going to get a federal charge because that's a gun crime.
[01:09:16.314 --> 01:09:19.636]  But then you think it's, oh, they're just getting gangbangers and throwing the book at them.
[01:09:19.716 --> 01:09:20.276]  No, no, no.
[01:09:21.317 --> 01:09:22.818]  Larry Pratt, good to have you on with us.
[01:09:23.158 --> 01:09:24.038]  Good to be with you.
[01:09:24.118 --> 01:09:25.259]  Thank you so much for having me.
[01:09:27.589 --> 01:09:46.900]  Measures that we're talking about, not only is it a gag bill, but this thing is getting worse because we're also talking about another piece of legislation, the Renewal of the Patriot Act, which has an amendment that was offered in a secret meeting of the Senate Intelligence Committee.
[01:09:47.901 --> 01:09:51.102]  So we don't know who sponsored it, but we do know finally what it says.
[01:09:51.142 --> 01:09:53.944]  They finally did print the amendment for that.
[01:09:54.734 --> 01:10:03.500]  And I'll try to get into exactly how it would work, but the cut to the chase, it would set up the potential for a national gun registry.
[01:10:04.421 --> 01:10:12.426]  All gun owners who had ever bought a gun... Well, the head of the FBI a few months ago was in front of the committee saying this, so they're not playing games!
[01:10:12.706 --> 01:10:14.307]  No, this is something they want.
[01:10:15.608 --> 01:10:19.811]  In this case, just to start with the last bill, they
[01:10:20.499 --> 01:10:20.960]  I don't know.
[01:10:42.333 --> 01:10:45.274]  Uh, and I'll have to do this at three o'clock in the afternoon.
[01:10:45.294 --> 01:10:49.815]  And they would, you know, Fourth Amendment, name the place, the person, the things to be seized.
[01:10:50.135 --> 01:10:51.516]  Okay, what's the horse look like?
[01:10:51.556 --> 01:11:00.478]  Well, it's got a big brown spot on its hind quarter, it's cream colored, it answers to Billy, and it has my brand on it.
[01:11:00.858 --> 01:11:05.960]  And so if Billy's not there at three o'clock along with John Doe, I gotta go get another
[01:11:06.696 --> 01:11:14.318]  I got a search warrant from a judge, and I got a show all over again that, well, yeah, the horse wasn't there then, but they were all out in the pastures.
[01:11:14.458 --> 01:11:15.478]  Okay, that's a good reason.
[01:11:15.858 --> 01:11:17.379]  Try it at 9 o'clock tonight.
[01:11:18.119 --> 01:11:20.440]  So it had to be done like that.
[01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:32.783]  Now we're talking about no judge, no third party, nobody outside the agency, somebody within the Justice Department simply being approached by a guy down the hall that works in the FBI.
[01:11:33.808 --> 01:11:35.113]  I want to go after John Doe.
[01:11:35.133 --> 01:11:36.539]  I want to take a look at his computer.
[01:11:37.330 --> 01:11:42.191]  And I want to get all of his business records.
[01:11:42.271 --> 01:11:46.572]  Well, this is the enabling clause for the new domestic spy agency.
[01:11:46.912 --> 01:11:56.714]  Well, it would certainly enable you to spy because if you get a gun stores, if you get all of their business records, guess what you got?
[01:11:57.154 --> 01:12:00.834]  You got a registration list of everybody that bought a gun through them.
[01:12:00.974 --> 01:12:04.075]  And if you did that to every gun dealer in the country,
[01:12:05.013 --> 01:12:09.476]  You wouldn't have everybody, because some folks have never bought a gun from a dealer.
[01:12:10.016 --> 01:12:11.997]  Most have bought at least one.
[01:12:12.357 --> 01:12:13.218]  They're going to be on the list.
[01:12:13.958 --> 01:12:20.742]  And that's how easy it would be for Janet Reno II, under a Hillary Clinton, to do something like this.
[01:12:20.762 --> 01:12:21.462]  Well, let me look.
[01:12:21.722 --> 01:12:23.263]  We have Janet Reno II.
[01:12:23.683 --> 01:12:25.484]  Alberto Gonzales is in his heart.
[01:12:25.564 --> 01:12:26.605]  He believes in gun control.
[01:12:26.625 --> 01:12:27.005]  That's true.
[01:12:27.045 --> 01:12:28.386]  He wants the assault weapons ban.
[01:12:29.156 --> 01:12:30.657]  And he thought he could get away with it?
[01:12:30.917 --> 01:12:36.321]  Yes, I think he would absolutely do that because those are the kinds of things he has said he believes.
[01:12:37.321 --> 01:12:38.862]  Boy, Bush sure is conservative!
[01:12:39.062 --> 01:12:39.423]  Boy!
[01:12:39.863 --> 01:12:56.754]  Well, we got ourselves some trouble because they're also talking about people like Bob Novak and the scholar John Lott, both of them this week reporting that Gonzalez is a very likely nominee for the Supreme Court.
[01:12:57.394 --> 01:12:58.435]  And in addition to his
[01:12:59.676 --> 01:13:07.541]  You know what?
[01:13:09.242 --> 01:13:16.006]  They'll put him in there, they'll ban our guns, and we'll be called liberals, Larry, because we're pro-gun.
[01:13:16.026 --> 01:13:20.889]  I'm so sick of these thumb-sucking, so-called conservatives, a bunch of idiots!
[01:13:21.549 --> 01:13:23.430]  Well, we're in real trouble.
[01:13:23.450 --> 01:13:27.013]  Well, seven of the nine on this court that's saying we don't have private property, Larry.
[01:13:27.213 --> 01:13:31.195]  Let me just digress for a millisecond here and let you get back into all this and how to fight it.
[01:13:31.395 --> 01:13:33.837]  What do you think of the Supreme Court ruling on the land grabbing?
[01:13:33.877 --> 01:13:35.258]  I mean, it just never ends, Larry.
[01:13:35.338 --> 01:13:44.163]  Well, I think that ought to be a shot across the bow, if you will, for gun owners because it was such an obvious hit on everybody.
[01:13:44.363 --> 01:13:46.885]  The only good thing I could think about in that ruling
[01:13:47.515 --> 01:13:47.935]  Well, it's
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:11.961]  And help do the job.
[01:14:12.061 --> 01:14:14.303]  I'd work for free if I had to run one of those things.
[01:14:14.723 --> 01:14:16.524]  Yeah, folks are saying we can't be like them.
[01:14:16.604 --> 01:14:17.025]  No, no, no.
[01:14:17.105 --> 01:14:18.365]  He's the one that did this.
[01:14:18.445 --> 01:14:19.506]  We need to have it repealed.
[01:14:19.686 --> 01:14:22.168]  Well, we have to come to grips with it.
[01:14:22.248 --> 01:14:24.870]  I mean, I think they should take his house and build a hotel on it.
[01:14:24.890 --> 01:14:25.630]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:14:26.291 --> 01:14:33.796]  It would be a much more productive tax yield, higher tax paying property than his little old squirrely $100,000
[01:14:35.297 --> 01:14:36.278]  House, which is probably 300,000.
[01:14:36.318 --> 01:14:40.562]  Yeah, 500,000 here in the metropolitan Washington area.
[01:14:40.902 --> 01:14:42.003]  So it's not that shabby.
[01:14:42.043 --> 01:14:46.026]  It's just that it's inexpensive relatively up in that part of New Hampshire.
[01:14:47.047 --> 01:14:52.792]  But we, I think, have to come to grips with a vocabulary that's been denied us.
[01:14:53.353 --> 01:14:57.076]  We used to realize that King George III was a rebel.
[01:14:57.620 --> 01:15:03.302]  And that's why our men were willing to go into the field and defend Hearth and Home.
[01:15:03.342 --> 01:15:05.322]  Yeah, he was engaging in criminality.
[01:15:05.362 --> 01:15:06.122]  He was oppressive.
[01:15:06.462 --> 01:15:06.922]  Exactly.
[01:15:07.583 --> 01:15:10.803]  He was no longer deserving of the title King.
[01:15:11.284 --> 01:15:15.265]  He had become destructive of the people's basic rights.
[01:15:15.625 --> 01:15:20.346]  And now that we are in the run-up to July 4, it would probably behoove us all.
[01:15:20.786 --> 01:15:22.308]  You know, I'll tell you something, Larry.
[01:15:22.368 --> 01:15:25.551]  I mean, you read the Declaration of Independence, it's exactly what's happening.
[01:15:25.891 --> 01:15:27.713]  Sounds kind of contemporary, indeed.
[01:15:28.093 --> 01:15:36.541]  Now, if gun owners realize, after this Fifth Amendment destruction, rewrite five to four, well, we just rewrote the amendment.
[01:15:36.721 --> 01:15:42.627]  Now, if they realize how easy that was, and how everybody is in jeopardy as one
[01:15:43.063 --> 01:15:44.905]  That person put it that I heard recently.
[01:15:44.945 --> 01:15:47.547]  Well, I guess we're all just renting our property, aren't we?
[01:15:47.828 --> 01:15:49.229]  None of us really own anything.
[01:15:49.509 --> 01:15:50.971]  We're kind of like a bunch of serfs.
[01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:54.972]  We've been thrown back to the Middle Ages, for goodness sake.
[01:15:55.212 --> 01:15:56.693]  Larry, let's go over this and I'll stop interrupting.
[01:15:56.713 --> 01:15:58.093]  There's just so many points you're bringing up.
[01:15:58.373 --> 01:16:03.996]  Okay, how do we stop this secret Patriot Act for the gun registration and the spying?
[01:16:04.516 --> 01:16:05.837]  How do we stop Gonzales?
[01:16:06.317 --> 01:16:06.938]  Heaven help us.
[01:16:07.498 --> 01:16:08.839]  And then this new gang bill.
[01:16:09.539 --> 01:16:12.981]  Well, and hopefully we'll have time to talk about that gang bill.
[01:16:13.001 --> 01:16:13.861]  We will, if you want to stay with us.
[01:16:13.881 --> 01:16:14.001]  Sure.
[01:16:14.201 --> 01:16:14.982]  That's a pretty one.
[01:16:15.362 --> 01:16:18.603]  But we don't have anything up on Gonzales yet.
[01:16:18.643 --> 01:16:19.244]  That's coming.
[01:16:20.364 --> 01:16:34.451]  We do have on the Patriot gun registration measure and the gang bill on our website, gunowners.org, and we've got email explaining it and inviting people to send the email we've written.
[01:16:34.471 --> 01:16:38.933]  If they don't like ours, they're certainly welcome to write their own, but we've made it easy.
[01:16:39.153 --> 01:16:39.714]  Send it in.
[01:16:40.094 --> 01:16:42.755]  The members of Congress got to realize we know what they're doing.
[01:16:43.143 --> 01:16:46.565]  We've killed stuff like the gang bill in the past.
[01:16:46.965 --> 01:16:56.752]  It's Orrin Hatch doing it to us all over again, the so-called conservative Republican from Utah, co-sponsoring the gang bill with Dianne Feinstein.
[01:16:57.032 --> 01:17:00.814]  That ought to be all you need to know that this is probably not good legislation.
[01:17:01.214 --> 01:17:03.816]  And again, you've done an analysis of it.
[01:17:03.856 --> 01:17:05.077]  Tell us about this new bill.
[01:17:05.637 --> 01:17:08.079]  Well, this is a little bit more complicated.
[01:17:08.679 --> 01:17:14.344]  Uh, to see what they're doing to us, but it wouldn't be complicated once you're sitting in jail.
[01:17:14.445 --> 01:17:15.506]  It would be a reality.
[01:17:16.046 --> 01:17:28.998]  The idea is that they've defined gang in a very loose way, and it involves anybody, say one of three people that hits a triggering action
[01:17:29.634 --> 01:17:39.420]  And a triggering action would be some, what they call, predicate offense that's been unconstitutionally made a violation of law by the federal government.
[01:17:39.441 --> 01:17:43.703]  So basically, just for any reason, they can just say you're a gang member?
[01:17:43.823 --> 01:17:44.264]  Almost.
[01:17:45.024 --> 01:17:45.825]  Here's the deal.
[01:17:45.845 --> 01:17:48.426]  Here's a very plausible scenario.
[01:17:49.287 --> 01:17:58.313]  You're in a state, there are several, where you are not allowed to use force until you've first retreated in the face of a violent attack.
[01:17:58.909 --> 01:18:04.573]  All right, with that in mind, you're in one of those states.
[01:18:04.593 --> 01:18:07.415]  Let me dial 911 first.
[01:18:07.455 --> 01:18:08.256]  Let's play fair.
[01:18:09.296 --> 01:18:16.882]  So let's assume that Sunday morning, you've got your wife and kids in the car, and after church you realize you need gas.
[01:18:17.944 --> 01:18:29.815]  You have, by the way, inadvertently, but almost everybody I did on my way to work this morning, you probably did too, unless you commuted home, but most of us have to drive by a school.
[01:18:30.176 --> 01:18:37.323]  You drive by a school, you're within a thousand feet of the outer perimeter of that school property, you've just gone through a school zone.
[01:18:38.268 --> 01:18:39.530]  And it sounds like a break coming.
[01:18:39.550 --> 01:18:39.911]  Let me finish.
[01:18:39.971 --> 01:18:40.713]  Yeah, now it's federal.
[01:18:40.733 --> 01:18:42.175]  When we come back, we'll finish the story.
[01:18:42.496 --> 01:18:42.876]  Please!
[01:18:43.097 --> 01:18:44.079]  Please don't kill me!
[01:18:44.159 --> 01:18:44.539]  No!
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:45.421]  Help me!
[01:18:45.481 --> 01:18:46.863]  Dial 9-1-1!
[01:18:46.944 --> 01:18:47.985]  I'm too weak!
[01:18:48.005 --> 01:18:49.268]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:19:00.726]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[01:19:01.266 --> 01:19:06.690]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:19:07.090 --> 01:19:17.118]  All Natural Non-X is a topical, ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[01:19:17.238 --> 01:19:20.061]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[01:19:20.081 --> 01:19:23.003]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[01:19:23.483 --> 01:19:24.643]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[01:19:24.763 --> 01:19:27.704]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris.
[01:19:27.944 --> 01:19:32.265]  It's podiatrist recommended and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[01:19:32.525 --> 01:19:34.265]  It's also money back guarantee.
[01:19:34.585 --> 01:19:46.367]  You'll find Non-X Gel spelled N-O-N-Y-X in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks and independent pharmacies nationwide or online at drugstore.com.
[01:19:46.847 --> 01:19:51.188]  Non-X Nail Gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:55.913]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[01:19:56.273 --> 01:19:59.136]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[01:19:59.376 --> 01:20:05.582]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[01:20:46.404 --> 01:20:47.685]  Currency devaluation.
[01:20:47.705 --> 01:20:48.505]  Inflation.
[01:20:48.605 --> 01:20:49.426]  One and the same.
[01:20:49.526 --> 01:20:58.910]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:13.842]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:21:14.222 --> 01:21:16.863]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:21:16.904 --> 01:21:20.846]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:21:22.507 --> 01:21:23.427]  Here is reality.
[01:21:23.747 --> 01:21:27.349]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:32.072]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:21:32.839 --> 01:21:36.722]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.

[01:23:02.563 --> 01:23:05.525]  Please, please, I'll give you whatever you want.
[01:23:05.545 --> 01:23:06.766]  Just please don't hurt me.
[01:23:06.866 --> 01:23:07.707]  I'm too weak.
[01:23:08.547 --> 01:23:09.168]  I was good.
[01:23:09.188 --> 01:23:11.009]  I never owned a firearm.
[01:23:11.029 --> 01:23:12.890]  Please don't hurt me and my family.
[01:23:13.350 --> 01:23:14.731]  Please, I'll do whatever you say.
[01:23:14.771 --> 01:23:15.732]  No, don't do that!
[01:23:15.812 --> 01:23:16.172]  No!
[01:23:16.472 --> 01:23:17.493]  No, please, no!
[01:23:17.753 --> 01:23:19.534]  No, please!
[01:23:19.574 --> 01:23:20.695]  Help me, government!
[01:23:20.895 --> 01:23:21.976]  Help me, government!
[01:23:23.317 --> 01:23:24.938]  Much less you worried about the average criminal.
[01:23:24.958 --> 01:23:26.018]  What about the government itself?
[01:23:26.058 --> 01:23:28.540]  More dangerous than anything else in human history.
[01:23:29.668 --> 01:23:36.412]  It is so alien to me to imagine not defending my family, to being just totally afraid of defending myself.
[01:23:36.472 --> 01:23:37.533]  It's so pathetic!
[01:23:38.632 --> 01:23:39.192]  All right, I'm sorry.
[01:23:39.232 --> 01:23:46.455]  Larry Fred, I'm ranting and raving and doing my pathetic imitation, but... Okay, so you're driving to work, taking the kids, you know, wherever.
[01:23:47.315 --> 01:23:48.636]  You've passed the school zone.
[01:23:49.016 --> 01:23:50.477]  You're a thousand feet from its perimeter.
[01:23:50.497 --> 01:23:51.117]  Please continue.
[01:23:51.637 --> 01:24:03.862]  So we're gassing up and we're approached by some less than honorable young men who have knives drawn and obviously have something other than selling apples to us in mind.
[01:24:04.395 --> 01:24:07.997]  So you happen to have a glove compartment with a gun in it.
[01:24:08.397 --> 01:24:09.457]  No, don't do that!
[01:24:10.198 --> 01:24:12.779]  You get the gun out and show it to them.
[01:24:13.219 --> 01:24:14.420]  That's called brandishing.
[01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:22.803]  And since you haven't fled first, that brandishing is a violent crime in those states where you're supposed to flee first.
[01:24:22.823 --> 01:24:29.586]  So at the red light with oncoming traffic, they're trying to carjack you, you should first open the door and go blaze them like you love to.
[01:24:29.766 --> 01:24:30.867]  And they're not going to stop you.
[01:24:31.027 --> 01:24:32.107]  Stab you first, right?
[01:24:32.147 --> 01:24:35.769]  Let me call 9-11, and maybe they'll be here before I die.
[01:24:36.509 --> 01:24:57.298]  And that means that if you've had that set of circumstances, you've driven through the school zone, predicate offense, because you had the gun in the glove compartment, and then you committed that act of violence, that telling the thug that you might shoot him and showing him that you had the wherewithal to do it, whoops, you're in a heap of trouble.
[01:24:58.078 --> 01:25:00.659]  Even if you happen to have had a concealed carry permit,
[01:25:01.221 --> 01:25:03.284]  It wouldn't, but not that you'd be likely to have one.
[01:25:03.325 --> 01:25:08.453]  Yeah, basically they're passing all these laws where just anything with a gun now is just this incredible offense.
[01:25:08.753 --> 01:25:16.105]  Thank you, Orrin Hatch, and this passed the House of Representatives, as you said in the intro a bit ago.
[01:25:17.027 --> 01:25:22.389]  Quite handily, because people thought, well, we're voting against gang violence, don't want to be for gang violence.
[01:25:22.909 --> 01:25:25.731]  Problem is, this is not a matter of federal jurisdiction.
[01:25:26.271 --> 01:25:42.377]  That doesn't seem to be a big issue these days, but, dog gone it, this is really going to hit gun owners, and it's going to hit them hard, because this would be, the scenario I just mapped out, would be mandatory minimum 20 years for you and your gang.
[01:25:43.072 --> 01:25:44.232]  You know, like your eleven-year-old kid?
[01:25:44.252 --> 01:25:45.133]  That's all you and your family.
[01:25:45.153 --> 01:25:49.034]  And by the way, I have them using the Patriot Act to arrest homeless people sleeping.
[01:25:50.094 --> 01:25:52.114]  So folks, don't think they won't do this.
[01:25:52.134 --> 01:25:52.834]  They're already doing it.
[01:25:52.854 --> 01:26:01.097]  You know, a guy's got a gun, and in his state it's only supposed to have ten rounds in it, and somehow he got eleven rounds in the magazine, and it's a doctor with no criminal record.
[01:26:01.397 --> 01:26:01.877]  That's it!
[01:26:02.197 --> 01:26:04.657]  Federal charges because it's a gun crime!
[01:26:04.938 --> 01:26:08.698]  See, the gun itself was the crime, not committing a crime with a gun.
[01:26:09.799 --> 01:26:10.559]  That's the, uh...
[01:26:11.475 --> 01:26:16.921]  The direction that this bill is certainly taking is these two bills are poison.
[01:26:18.342 --> 01:26:23.727]  The idea that they would, in the Patriot Act, use that to set up a national gun registry.
[01:26:24.648 --> 01:26:29.653]  The idea is, well, we need to see if any of the terrorists might be buying guns.
[01:26:30.154 --> 01:26:31.475]  Well, are they terrorists?
[01:26:31.715 --> 01:26:38.221]  If they are, why in the world are they out looting the 250 caliber barracks our government sold to Al-Qaeda?
[01:26:38.241 --> 01:26:38.762]  You mean those?
[01:26:38.962 --> 01:26:41.264]  Well, you know, why don't we arrest them?
[01:26:41.344 --> 01:26:48.150]  If they're here in the United States, and we shouldn't even be worried about them trying to buy a gun, they ought to be charged and arrested!
[01:26:48.530 --> 01:26:51.571]  Yeah, we should want more of our citizens to have guns like they do in Israel.
[01:26:52.032 --> 01:26:52.652]  Absolutely.
[01:26:53.212 --> 01:27:00.455]  I wonder why the Israel lobby is always lobbying for their politicians to get our guns, but then they hand out M16s to their people?
[01:27:00.856 --> 01:27:07.679]  Well, there's a real backwardness here because we're basically we're straining at match.
[01:27:07.779 --> 01:27:11.060]  That is the individual American that owns a gun.
[01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:13.501]  And we're swallowing camels.
[01:27:14.182 --> 01:27:17.303]  That is, we're letting the southwestern border
[01:27:18.262 --> 01:27:21.003]  Stay as open as a fire hydrant.
[01:27:21.063 --> 01:27:26.964]  And by the way, we have Los Zeptys going completely insane, killing hundreds, killing cops.
[01:27:27.985 --> 01:27:29.525]  It's almost a complete news blackout.
[01:27:29.945 --> 01:27:30.425]  That's right.
[01:27:30.545 --> 01:27:43.108]  The Americans that have been kidnapped down in Nuevo Laredo, and they rescued some people the other day, but they just casually mentioned in the one report I saw, nothing before or since.
[01:27:43.528 --> 01:27:46.009]  Well, the Americans that got kidnapped, we don't know where they are yet.
[01:27:46.858 --> 01:27:47.919]  That's no big deal.
[01:27:47.939 --> 01:27:49.479]  No, it's no big deal.
[01:27:49.519 --> 01:28:03.245]  By the way, it is confirmed, if you have any type of, you know, you drive to Mexico, you have your family, you do anything wrong in your car, they take the husband and wife, put the kids in an orphanage, and then extract hundreds of thousands out of your family.
[01:28:03.525 --> 01:28:05.386]  It is a criminal country, don't go there.
[01:28:06.547 --> 01:28:11.729]  It's a very dangerous place to be, because it's not just that they have a lot of crime,
[01:28:12.524 --> 01:28:18.086]  Uh, which they do, but as you say, the police themselves are often part of the problem.
[01:28:18.766 --> 01:28:22.468]  The sectors that you're talking about are ex-military and ex-cops?
[01:28:23.148 --> 01:28:24.408]  Well, they were trained by the U.S.
[01:28:24.448 --> 01:28:25.008]  government.
[01:28:25.309 --> 01:28:26.669]  They just get better paid now.
[01:28:26.809 --> 01:28:27.990]  Can you do five more minutes with us?
[01:28:28.030 --> 01:28:28.290]  Okay, fine.
[01:28:28.390 --> 01:28:32.851]  I want to come back and talk about some of the legislation, recap, and then give out your contact info.
[01:28:33.071 --> 01:28:34.072]  And then your calls, folks.
[01:28:34.092 --> 01:28:34.492]  Go ahead.
[01:28:43.408 --> 01:28:46.416]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.339 --> 01:28:50.026]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.015 --> 01:28:54.696]  Soon the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[01:28:54.897 --> 01:28:56.918]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.

[01:30:54.955 --> 01:30:58.997]  Hi, I'm Tom Valentine, and I want to tell you about the Sacro Wedge.

[01:31:36.639 --> 01:31:36.839]  Call them.
[01:31:36.859 --> 01:31:37.119]  It's only $29.95.
[01:31:37.199 --> 01:31:38.540]  And it really works.
[01:32:03.112 --> 01:32:07.474]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 central, back from 9 to midnight central standard time.
[01:32:07.494 --> 01:32:08.495]  We're here, my friends!
[01:32:10.095 --> 01:32:14.297]  And I will get to Megan and John and John and Steve and Matt and everybody else that's holding here in just a few minutes.
[01:32:15.138 --> 01:32:23.982]  Bottom line, slaves were disarmed in ancient Rome, or black Americans here in the United States, the first gun laws, after we kicked the British hind end.
[01:32:24.502 --> 01:32:25.943]  It was against blacks.
[01:32:27.144 --> 01:32:27.844]  And it's really simple.
[01:32:28.504 --> 01:32:29.745]  If you're disarmed, you're a slave.
[01:32:29.905 --> 01:32:40.572]  And the President has the courts, he has the state governors, he has the legislatures, he has the legislative in Washington, he has the executive.
[01:32:41.673 --> 01:32:44.535]  I don't think we've ever had one party with this much centralization.
[01:32:45.916 --> 01:32:49.999]  Since the last time the Republican Party had this much centralization during Reconstruction.
[01:32:51.159 --> 01:32:52.340]  And what do we see?
[01:32:53.941 --> 01:32:57.664]  Pro-abortion, pro-gun control people being appointed everywhere.
[01:32:59.767 --> 01:33:06.953]  Governor Pataki going after the gun manufacturers in New York, helping get a law passed so they can sue gun manufacturers.
[01:33:07.574 --> 01:33:08.475]  I'm sick of it.
[01:33:08.495 --> 01:33:10.237]  I don't want to hear the Democrats are going to get us.
[01:33:10.537 --> 01:33:16.663]  If scumbag people like Bill Clinton were in office and tried gun control, you'd have real conservatives take over the Congress.
[01:33:17.395 --> 01:33:18.896]  Larry Pratt, can you speak to this?
[01:33:18.936 --> 01:33:20.097]  I mean, I'm really getting angry.
[01:33:20.257 --> 01:33:26.500]  We could have all these gun bills repealed right now, but instead we're going straight to hell, and conservatives are asleep!
[01:33:26.841 --> 01:33:29.842]  It's amazing that we are fighting a defensive battle.
[01:33:29.962 --> 01:33:42.810]  I've been talking about two of them right in the previous segments with you, and as you say, we ought to be talking instead about which gun law are we repealing this month?
[01:33:43.970 --> 01:33:46.532]  Which one is it that the Republicans realize
[01:33:47.576 --> 01:33:56.000]  If nothing else, make a good vote, because they saw that it hurt the Democrats, cost them control of Congress, as you say, in 1994, cost them presidency in 2000.
[01:33:57.101 --> 01:34:02.884]  Why don't they make them vote on it regularly and often, knowing that it's going to hurt the Democrats?
[01:34:03.904 --> 01:34:15.810]  The CDC, the Center for Disease Control, which is in love with gun control, has done a study and found that gun control hadn't lowered crime,
[01:34:16.380 --> 01:34:26.265]  Well then, why don't they take their own government finding and shove it down the throat of pro-gun control proponents, and make them vote win, lose, or draw?
[01:34:26.285 --> 01:34:31.367]  Because even if we lose on the vote in the Congress, we know what to do the next election.
[01:34:31.467 --> 01:34:33.768]  We'll have proof what we can do with it.
[01:34:34.168 --> 01:34:39.991]  And it's not going to hurt the people that push it, because gun control is not popular with the American people.
[01:34:40.011 --> 01:34:41.672]  I think they instinctively realize
[01:34:42.370 --> 01:34:43.230]  It's true what you were just saying.
[01:34:43.250 --> 01:34:45.191]  And by the way, it's becoming less popular.
[01:34:45.251 --> 01:34:46.251]  We're winning the fight.
[01:34:46.531 --> 01:34:47.451]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:34:47.471 --> 01:34:49.952]  To the hearts and minds, but the government doesn't care what we want.
[01:34:49.992 --> 01:35:03.415]  And Larry, I've had a few good old boys in the last few years literally swagger up to me in a grocery store or at the shopping mall or walking down the street and going, George Bush ain't for gun control.
[01:35:03.515 --> 01:35:06.195]  Alex, I heard him on TV, so he believes in it.
[01:35:06.655 --> 01:35:08.036]  That's rhetoric, folks.
[01:35:08.176 --> 01:35:09.576]  That is sleeping gas.
[01:35:10.620 --> 01:35:17.285]  Yeah, when somebody says they want to renew a ban on guns, they say are militia guns, and they're not really.
[01:35:17.666 --> 01:35:21.348]  So they don't even, you know, tell us the truth about what it is they're trying to ban.
[01:35:21.709 --> 01:35:25.412]  But they're rifles, they're guns that belong in the hands of the American people.
[01:35:25.892 --> 01:35:38.922]  And when they say they want to ban them, the idea that they don't want us to have military guns, even though these weren't, that ought to tell us something, because the Second Amendment was intended to protect our ownership.
[01:35:39.483 --> 01:35:40.664]  of military guns.
[01:35:41.345 --> 01:35:48.392]  The whole idea was that the militia, being the people, always be ready to be called up.
[01:35:48.612 --> 01:35:59.763]  I've been privileged to interview on my little talk show, Live Fire, a guy, a researcher who's done a lot of work on the Fed and what a mess that is, and he's gone and read
[01:36:00.396 --> 01:36:02.578]  All the militia laws from Colonial America.
[01:36:02.598 --> 01:36:03.478]  He's writing a book.
[01:36:03.518 --> 01:36:05.580]  He's written a few articles so far.
[01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:09.963]  And he found that the militia system was mandatory.
[01:36:10.424 --> 01:36:12.525]  That you had to have a gun.
[01:36:12.545 --> 01:36:14.427]  You had to have a military gun.
[01:36:14.627 --> 01:36:16.388]  It was just like Switzerland.
[01:36:16.708 --> 01:36:19.751]  It was so close to what they do in Switzerland.
[01:36:20.431 --> 01:36:22.453]  Maybe not quite as many professional officers.
[01:36:22.493 --> 01:36:23.353]  They've got all of maybe 3,000.
[01:36:24.334 --> 01:36:27.056]  Will you do me a favor and send over that guest?
[01:36:27.717 --> 01:36:27.997]  Yes.
[01:36:28.621 --> 01:36:46.075]  Yes, Edwin Vieira is a first-rate researcher, a very articulate man, and what he has been finding and documenting is absolutely... Well, we have that professor up in Chicago lying, saying nobody owned guns, and he just got kicked out of that school.
[01:36:46.556 --> 01:36:50.759]  Yeah, the Emory professor Baleels, and he's
[01:36:52.119 --> 01:36:54.940]  Man, a big tailspin of disgrace, happily.
[01:36:55.380 --> 01:36:58.080]  In fact, I even have a book on my desk.
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:03.842]  I'm holding it in my hand, Past Imperfect, about some of the historians that have committed fraud.
[01:37:05.202 --> 01:37:07.182]  And this is one big one.
[01:37:07.342 --> 01:37:11.603]  And Vieira has shown that, yeah, we had a militia and they had guns.
[01:37:11.943 --> 01:37:14.024]  In fact, when you came to the militia,
[01:37:14.924 --> 01:37:21.933]  Muster, which you had to come to unless you were a politician or a doctor or there were a list of enumerated exemptions.
[01:37:22.393 --> 01:37:26.158]  And even then, when there was an invasion, everybody had to come.
[01:37:26.178 --> 01:37:29.582]  It didn't matter whether you were giving a speech or delivering a baby.
[01:37:29.922 --> 01:37:32.385]  You had to show up and defend against the invasion.
[01:37:32.906 --> 01:37:33.847]  But by the way,
[01:37:35.487 --> 01:37:38.970]  There were strict laws against a standing army to invade anybody.
[01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:40.751]  That was Prasada Nangrata.
[01:37:41.311 --> 01:37:42.171]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:37:42.352 --> 01:37:49.256]  And the reason they thought they didn't need a standing army was because they had a militia that had to own a gun.
[01:37:49.496 --> 01:37:52.738]  And when you showed up at muster, you better have a gun.
[01:37:52.758 --> 01:37:57.961]  And in fact, they got suspicious sometimes and made people sign that was their gun.
[01:37:58.181 --> 01:38:00.402]  They didn't borrow it from somebody else.
[01:38:01.323 --> 01:38:01.603]  Even
[01:38:02.236 --> 01:38:08.563]  There were times when they would go door-to-door, not like Billy Clinton through the projects to steal people's guns.
[01:38:09.023 --> 01:38:13.608]  They went door-to-door to the militia to make sure they had a gun!
[01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:16.872]  I know, well I had read that and I knew that.
[01:38:17.493 --> 01:38:22.438]  I mean, it's disgusting and I like the Kennesaw, Georgia law where you gotta own a gun.
[01:38:22.458 --> 01:38:24.180]  Of course, there's a waiver if you don't want it.
[01:38:24.855 --> 01:38:26.337]  I mean, the crime rate, what, went down by 87%?
[01:38:26.537 --> 01:38:34.224]  They had a home burglary rate that almost went to zero, and that was exactly what they were trying to do, and it worked!
[01:38:35.706 --> 01:38:39.750]  But then you look at New York and Chicago with gun bans, they're literal hellholes.
[01:38:40.370 --> 01:38:45.335]  Now, if we want to have legislation dealing with gang violence,
[01:38:45.734 --> 01:38:47.154]  Then let Illinois deal with it.
[01:38:47.194 --> 01:38:48.755]  Let California deal with it.
[01:38:48.795 --> 01:39:02.238]  But this is not a federal issue, and as long as these states like Illinois and California want to ban a lot of guns and make it impossible for most people to carry a gun concealed, well then let them live in their own spilled blood!
[01:39:02.338 --> 01:39:03.979]  We can turn this around.
[01:39:04.339 --> 01:39:12.681]  If conservatives get angry and stop buying the lives of the Republicans, we are losing some fights right now on this because you're asleep.
[01:39:13.368 --> 01:39:19.190]  Governor Pataki and others, you know, one state allowing suits of gun manufacturers can shut it all down.
[01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:24.672]  We've got gun manufacturers going out of business left and right, so buy some guns, folks.
[01:39:25.172 --> 01:39:28.433]  Support this industry, because it is a hallmark of freedom.
[01:39:29.033 --> 01:39:32.614]  Larry Pratt, give us the website, the toll-free number, and anything else you'd like to plug.
[01:39:33.074 --> 01:39:35.555]  Well, please do go to gunowners.org.
[01:39:35.575 --> 01:39:38.776]  We've got email, not only for information, but for action.
[01:39:38.816 --> 01:39:41.477]  If you read our email, you can click on a link and go
[01:39:42.237 --> 01:39:45.839]  Send an email to the Congress about these measures that we're talking about.
[01:39:46.259 --> 01:39:52.163]  The gang bill, the gun registration through the administrative subpoenas, gunowners.org.
[01:39:52.343 --> 01:39:55.264]  If you can't do that, call our toll-free number, which is 888-886-GUNS.
[01:40:01.403 --> 01:40:04.566]  Well, God bless you, Larry Perrette, and when is your radio show on?
[01:40:04.946 --> 01:40:06.747]  It's a weekly Saturday.
[01:40:06.867 --> 01:40:08.629]  It airs live at noon.
[01:40:08.689 --> 01:40:11.071]  It's on our website also at GunOwners.org.
[01:40:11.231 --> 01:40:15.414]  You know, Larry, I know you're on your own little network, but I think you ought to talk to Ted Anderson.
[01:40:15.434 --> 01:40:18.097]  We've got a lot of affiliates, and it's always good to have more satellites.
[01:40:18.117 --> 01:40:20.939]  We've got some of the premium radio satellites.
[01:40:21.219 --> 01:40:23.361]  We need to get your show simulcast on the network.
[01:40:23.701 --> 01:40:24.941]  I would love to do that.
[01:40:25.862 --> 01:40:30.123]  I'll email you and try to get the contact for that gentleman.
[01:40:30.223 --> 01:40:38.646]  You know what, I'll just have Ted contact you because that is... I've heard the broadcast before online and it is exemplary and it's something everybody should tune in to each week.
[01:40:38.946 --> 01:40:41.867]  Larry Perret, thanks for spending 35 minutes with us.
[01:40:42.087 --> 01:40:43.648]  Alex, thank you so much for having me.
[01:40:43.828 --> 01:40:44.508]  Take care, my friend.
[01:40:44.528 --> 01:40:44.828]  You too.
[01:40:45.068 --> 01:40:45.348]  Bye-bye.
[01:40:45.708 --> 01:40:46.369]  Alright, folks.
[01:40:46.409 --> 01:40:47.649]  There's the State of the Second Amendment.
[01:40:47.689 --> 01:40:49.870]  A bunch of degenerate, disgusting,
[01:40:50.550 --> 01:40:54.413]  Worm-headed, evil Republicans trying to get your guns.
[01:40:56.414 --> 01:41:05.060]  Few things make me mad, but these good ol' boys, swaggerin' up in their cowboy hats, probably never been on a horse in their life, or branded any cattle.
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:06.221]  It's always a good ol' boy, though.
[01:41:06.581 --> 01:41:10.024]  JORDAN BUSH, I'M FROM GUN CONTROL, ALEC, YOU'RE A LIAR!
[01:41:10.484 --> 01:41:11.124]  SHUT UP!
[01:41:11.364 --> 01:41:11.945]  SHUT UP!
[01:41:12.745 --> 01:41:17.729]  Don't you dare try to destroy my birthright through your slovenly ignorance, you morons!
[01:41:18.806 --> 01:41:20.527]  We're losing this whole country right now!
[01:41:21.647 --> 01:41:23.868]  You people make me sick!
[01:41:26.069 --> 01:41:28.009]  You understand if they get our guns, it's over?
[01:41:29.770 --> 01:41:31.591]  You understand they're very close to getting them?
[01:41:33.211 --> 01:41:38.813]  But the NRA isn't going to tell you that, because they go into federal court and lobby against the Second Amendment!
[01:41:39.013 --> 01:41:40.534]  We've caught them red-handed!
[01:41:40.554 --> 01:41:41.594]  They're controlled!
[01:41:43.295 --> 01:41:44.095]  Alright, I'm going to settle down.
[01:41:44.115 --> 01:41:44.776]  I've got to go quick now.
[01:41:44.796 --> 01:41:45.716]  Everybody's been holding forever.
[01:41:46.627 --> 01:41:48.168]  Megan called in, it got cut short.
[01:41:49.229 --> 01:41:54.812]  Megan is calling us from Pennsylvania about, yeah, CAPTA's passed the House and Senate committees.
[01:41:55.272 --> 01:41:58.093]  It could be voted on in the full House and Senate today or tomorrow.
[01:41:59.094 --> 01:42:06.058]  It dwarfs, it's roughly about nine to twelve times, depending on what study, larger in its impact than NAFTA.
[01:42:06.798 --> 01:42:10.821]  And so if you thought that was bad, again, it's just, it's just, anything else, Megan?
[01:42:10.841 --> 01:42:12.722]  You watched them pass it there in committee earlier.
[01:42:13.042 --> 01:42:14.843]  Yeah, you know, well, I took a
[01:42:15.498 --> 01:42:20.361]  No, I just jotted down everybody who voted, because I had a list of all the members, so I voted down their vote next to them.
[01:42:20.721 --> 01:42:33.509]  I was thinking, you know, I could email that so that people could call, you know, send a little note to your congressman thanking them for taking away your sovereignty, and just remembering, you know, one of the big things... Well, there's only, what, 11 people on the committee?
[01:42:33.529 --> 01:42:35.090]  Why don't you just read... There's 35, actually.
[01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:37.191]  Oh, this is a larger committee.
[01:42:37.211 --> 01:42:38.111]  Yes, it's quite large.
[01:42:38.352 --> 01:42:39.952]  Well, give us some of the names.
[01:42:40.333 --> 01:42:42.194]  Okay, here's Bill Thomas.
[01:42:42.214 --> 01:42:42.894]  He's the chairman.
[01:42:42.954 --> 01:42:43.795]  He was really...
[01:42:44.639 --> 01:42:45.299]  He was a yes.
[01:42:45.519 --> 01:42:47.880]  I'll tell you from Texas, Kevin Brady was a yes.
[01:42:48.721 --> 01:42:51.042]  He said it would be good for farms and small businesses.
[01:42:51.202 --> 01:42:55.763]  However, Lloyd Doggett of Texas was against it.
[01:42:56.324 --> 01:42:59.745]  Earl Pomeroy from North Dakota had very good points to make.
[01:42:59.785 --> 01:43:01.666]  He was a no vote.
[01:43:03.646 --> 01:43:06.368]  The thing that people need to remember is that we get to vote again in 08.
[01:43:08.972 --> 01:43:18.262]  In 07, the farms, this will totally pretty much supersede our farm bill, so the farmers have protections for another two years and after that they're completely, you know, toast.
[01:43:19.023 --> 01:43:23.407]  When all these restrictions that protect the farms right now are going to be gone.
[01:43:23.427 --> 01:43:24.869]  Yeah, everything goes in in 07 and 08.
[01:43:25.049 --> 01:43:26.010]  Yeah, it's going to be bad.
[01:43:26.090 --> 01:43:31.796]  And look folks, do you think all this foreign food being dumped on us is bad now?
[01:43:32.654 --> 01:43:34.915]  Just wait, but you think the textile's shutting down?
[01:43:34.935 --> 01:43:37.276]  You think all these jobs are going as bad?
[01:43:37.296 --> 01:43:39.417]  Don't worry, it's going to get a lot worse.
[01:43:39.677 --> 01:43:41.138]  But that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[01:43:41.178 --> 01:43:46.140]  It also controls our regulatory agencies, merges law enforcement, merges databases.
[01:43:46.621 --> 01:43:47.661]  It is a union.
[01:43:48.021 --> 01:43:49.702]  Yeah, it was really appalling.
[01:43:49.742 --> 01:43:52.203]  I actually was crying a little bit.
[01:43:52.223 --> 01:43:56.385]  By the way, the Canadians' newspapers and their governments openly admitting it's the end of their sovereignty.
[01:43:56.746 --> 01:43:58.626]  Yeah, it definitely is.
[01:43:58.686 --> 01:43:59.667]  Listening to the different
[01:44:00.356 --> 01:44:01.637]  Point, counterpoint, back and forth.
[01:44:01.697 --> 01:44:02.657]  It is just appalling.
[01:44:02.677 --> 01:44:04.058]  I've never watched a hearing like that.
[01:44:04.098 --> 01:44:04.678]  Yeah, email me that.
[01:44:04.718 --> 01:44:05.499]  I'd like to post it.
[01:44:05.519 --> 01:44:07.119]  Send it to tips at InfoWars.com.
[01:44:07.139 --> 01:44:08.160]  Thank you, Megan.
[01:44:08.420 --> 01:44:09.320]  Great points, and God bless.
[01:44:09.641 --> 01:44:10.541]  John in California.
[01:44:10.581 --> 01:44:11.161]  Got to move quick.
[01:44:11.201 --> 01:44:12.302]  John, and then John in Ohio.
[01:44:12.322 --> 01:44:12.922]  John, go ahead.
[01:44:13.442 --> 01:44:14.483]  Hey, Alex.
[01:44:14.843 --> 01:44:21.807]  I just wanted to talk about the evolution teaching in our schools, and I'm wondering if you hear about a person called Kent Hovind.
[01:44:24.188 --> 01:44:26.529]  It brings some nebulous bell.
[01:44:27.205 --> 01:44:34.429]  Yeah, and about the Second Amendment, too, people just don't understand, can't get it through their heads, it's just our last defense of defending ourselves against our government.
[01:44:34.449 --> 01:44:35.549]  What if our government goes back?
[01:44:36.730 --> 01:44:37.090]  Period.
[01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:41.632]  Well, did you hear about the honor student who wrote an article about God?
[01:44:41.652 --> 01:44:47.555]  They said, write about whatever you want, and he just said, I don't care, you get an F, because God is like the Easter Bunny, it doesn't exist.
[01:44:47.875 --> 01:44:50.477]  So see now, they penalize you for not having their views.
[01:44:51.017 --> 01:44:52.758]  Yeah, it's ridiculous.
[01:44:53.385 --> 01:44:56.347]  And I wanted to know if you heard about a guy named Michael Bagnerik.
[01:44:56.607 --> 01:44:58.208]  Yeah, I'm friends with Michael Bagnerik.
[01:44:58.249 --> 01:44:59.850]  He was the presidential candidate.
[01:45:00.190 --> 01:45:01.211]  Yeah.
[01:45:01.251 --> 01:45:02.151]  He's from Austin, Texas.
[01:45:02.532 --> 01:45:04.753]  He talks about basically real estate.
[01:45:05.053 --> 01:45:06.654]  You own everything from the ground up.
[01:45:06.694 --> 01:45:07.355]  You don't own the ground.
[01:45:07.395 --> 01:45:12.619]  That's basically why you have to get permission to go drill for water or oil or anything on your own.
[01:45:12.639 --> 01:45:14.400]  Well, the government claims that right.
[01:45:14.460 --> 01:45:15.981]  Yeah, it claims they're God, basically.
[01:45:16.341 --> 01:45:16.642]  Yeah.
[01:45:17.882 --> 01:45:18.583]  It's ridiculous.
[01:45:20.271 --> 01:45:29.736]  It's called feudalism, sir, and just because the government says you don't own your body, just because the government says you don't own your property, just because the government says you don't have rights, doesn't mean that that's the case.
[01:45:30.076 --> 01:45:32.197]  They are in violation of the Big Ten.
[01:45:32.577 --> 01:45:33.718]  That's the supreme law.
[01:45:36.079 --> 01:45:40.121]  The state police come out with a regulation where our regulation supersedes the Constitution.
[01:45:40.461 --> 01:45:41.802]  No it doesn't, criminals!
[01:45:41.842 --> 01:45:42.502]  Thanks for the call.
[01:45:43.322 --> 01:45:44.163]  I am sick of it.
[01:45:45.123 --> 01:45:46.804]  Folks, we're losing everything right now.
[01:45:47.124 --> 01:45:48.344]  We're losing the Second Amendment.
[01:45:48.504 --> 01:45:50.265]  They're suing manufacturers left and right.
[01:45:50.305 --> 01:45:51.005]  Thanks for Pataki.
[01:45:51.545 --> 01:45:53.666]  You're going to lose your ability to buy them.
[01:45:53.686 --> 01:45:54.346]  This isn't a joke.
[01:45:55.367 --> 01:45:56.667]  They're going after the land rights.
[01:45:57.808 --> 01:45:59.248]  They're going after our borders.
[01:45:59.268 --> 01:46:00.749]  They're going after everything.
[01:46:01.329 --> 01:46:03.150]  Our kids with forced psychological testing.
[01:46:03.730 --> 01:46:05.411]  John in Ohio.
[01:46:05.471 --> 01:46:06.051]  Welcome, John.
[01:46:06.613 --> 01:46:07.515]  Hello, Alex.
[01:46:07.755 --> 01:46:08.777]  I hope you can hold me over.
[01:46:08.797 --> 01:46:10.520]  A lot of things came to mind while I was waiting.
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:11.902]  Well, your phone sounds bad.
[01:46:11.922 --> 01:46:13.204]  Can you get up on the mic there?
[01:46:13.625 --> 01:46:14.286]  Okay.
[01:46:14.787 --> 01:46:15.768]  I just wanted to say that.
[01:46:15.849 --> 01:46:18.092]  By the way, I heard you calling on coast to coast to defend me.
[01:46:18.353 --> 01:46:19.535]  You did a sterling job.
[01:46:20.345 --> 01:46:28.191]  Yes, I have to give you credit for those issues with which I agree with you, but I still have these disagreements, and I commend you for what you're doing on those issues.
[01:46:28.271 --> 01:46:34.075]  I think it's really partly important, and a lot of the timid left won't get into these things.
[01:46:35.176 --> 01:46:38.558]  And the bottom line, we've had this debate for a couple of years now, John, you call in every few months.
[01:46:39.119 --> 01:46:49.847]  You think that basically the socialists or the leftists or whatever aren't controlled by the bankers when the founding documents show that they founded a lot of it and took control of most of it.
[01:46:49.887 --> 01:46:50.167]  Go ahead.
[01:46:50.848 --> 01:46:53.552]  Well, I'll start with that on the other end of what I was going to talk about.
[01:46:53.612 --> 01:46:55.415]  It's kind of a response to Carlos.
[01:46:55.435 --> 01:46:56.477]  I knew it!
[01:46:56.517 --> 01:47:01.825]  You don't like the fact that some of these Marxists and others were meeting with the bankers.
[01:47:02.475 --> 01:47:03.355]  No, that's not it.
[01:47:03.396 --> 01:47:05.136]  Please don't put words in my mouth.
[01:47:05.196 --> 01:47:05.737]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:47:05.757 --> 01:47:06.037]  Go ahead.
[01:47:06.077 --> 01:47:06.557]  I'll shut up.
[01:47:06.577 --> 01:47:07.157]  You got the floor.
[01:47:07.277 --> 01:47:21.464]  And I'm saying that rather than throwing, I think, calumny and daggers at those who are really on the nice point of the world globalist and the military industrial complex and the Central Intelligence Agency like Cuba and Venezuela.
[01:47:22.324 --> 01:47:23.305]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:47:23.585 --> 01:47:27.667]  When they have been subjected to assassinations, assassination attempts,
[01:47:28.411 --> 01:47:37.087]  Terrorism all these years, in the case of Chavez, he's been overthrown twice by elites allied with our CIA, colluding to overthrow him, nearly killed him.
[01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:49.252]  And for 45 years, Castro for opposing the policies of the World Bank and the IMF has been subjected to airlines being blown up in his country, hotels being bombed, German warfare being perpetrated.
[01:47:49.372 --> 01:47:51.714]  Yeah, that's admitted.
[01:47:51.774 --> 01:47:55.158]  Just because our government's evil doesn't mean Fidel's good.
[01:47:55.238 --> 01:48:00.683]  People either see Republican good, Democrat good, or Cuba good, America bad.
[01:48:00.743 --> 01:48:01.444]  No, they're all bad.
[01:48:01.964 --> 01:48:16.567]  Well, I have a disagreement on that, but at the same time, I think that we should not be throwing daggers at those that the very same military industrial CIA assassins are trying to overthrow, precisely because they are opposing these policies of the World Bank.
[01:48:16.867 --> 01:48:18.687]  You talk about sleeping gas and rhetoric.
[01:48:19.048 --> 01:48:30.110]  There are some leftists who, before they come into office, like Lula da Silva in Brazil, are brought into office because they claim to be opposing those very same policies of austerity and privatization and looting of their country.
[01:48:30.390 --> 01:48:31.270]  Once they get in office,
[01:48:31.650 --> 01:48:41.198]  They go along with it, which is why the American government tolerates a man like Lula, but will not tolerate Castro, or even Chavez, a populist like Chavez.
[01:48:41.718 --> 01:48:54.808]  So I agree with you that you were talking earlier about how on the Sean Hannity Show they tried to use the complicity of the Democrats in war mongering and lying us into attacking and starving a million people to death in Iraq.
[01:48:55.922 --> 01:48:57.023]  It's more than a million.
[01:48:57.303 --> 01:48:58.623]  Yes, yes, more than a million.
[01:48:58.883 --> 01:49:01.684]  To justify the war mongering and lies of the Republicans.
[01:49:01.805 --> 01:49:12.289]  The conservative estimate now, since 1990 at the start to 2005, two and a half years, or two and a quarter years into occupation, is about a million, six hundred thousand.
[01:49:12.853 --> 01:49:20.961]  Yes, and we have to remember that Clinton was primarily the director of that kind of genocide, even though he had the full support of the Republicans.
[01:49:21.321 --> 01:49:30.850]  For somebody like this, Bonnie Hannity, to come up and say, because the Clintonites were complicit in that genocide, in that line, that means that... That was all PNAC directed!
[01:49:31.491 --> 01:49:31.851]  Yes!
[01:49:32.492 --> 01:49:37.957]  And I think we've also got to realize you were also talking about what happened in Yugoslavia.
[01:49:38.650 --> 01:49:45.879]  The reason that Milosevic was demonized was because he didn't want to go along with becoming part of NATO and privatizing all of his industry.
[01:49:45.919 --> 01:49:48.422]  This is one of the demands... No, it was a thriving country.
[01:49:48.462 --> 01:49:49.484]  Stay there, I'll let you finish up.
[01:49:53.132 --> 01:49:57.474]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:57.674 --> 01:50:02.096]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.236 --> 01:50:06.598]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:06.638 --> 01:50:07.999]  The New World Order.
[01:50:08.759 --> 01:50:09.740]  Panama!
[01:50:09.780 --> 01:50:14.001]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.061 --> 01:50:21.004]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.124 --> 01:50:23.185]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:23.385 --> 01:50:33.889]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much much more.
[01:50:33.909 --> 01:50:35.230]  If you want to understand what
[01:50:35.230 --> 01:50:36.270]  That's what the New World Order really is.

[01:51:54.420 --> 01:51:58.004]  These chemicals are affecting our brains and may well destroy our society.
[01:51:58.124 --> 01:51:58.484]  Shocking?
[01:51:58.584 --> 01:51:59.044]  Of course!

[01:52:45.566 --> 01:52:48.068]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:52:48.228 --> 01:52:58.033]  The Constitution has been shredded and America is now a police state.

[01:54:49.580 --> 01:54:50.961]  Folks, I can't mention it all.
[01:54:51.401 --> 01:54:52.362]  E-books, you name it.
[01:54:52.422 --> 01:54:53.663]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:54:53.923 --> 01:54:54.824]  Take action, don't wait.
[01:54:54.844 --> 01:54:56.645]  Alright, before I go back to John, I'm just going to say this.
[01:54:58.666 --> 01:54:59.827]  This is just scientific.
[01:55:00.888 --> 01:55:05.591]  I am for a decentralized government that has a Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:55:05.731 --> 01:55:07.332]  I am for a Constitutional Republic.
[01:55:08.616 --> 01:55:19.699]  It is the real political science that, whether you call it socialism or fascism or communism, anything centralized, always throughout history, is taken over by a small elite.
[01:55:20.279 --> 01:55:25.941]  If you do not have a big government and you do not have big mechanisms, you cannot have a dictatorship.
[01:55:26.221 --> 01:55:28.661]  You cannot have a plutocracy or an oligarchy.
[01:55:29.842 --> 01:55:30.382]  It's that simple.
[01:55:31.522 --> 01:55:34.743]  Okay, so we got away from the monarchs, but the same people that are the monarchs,
[01:55:35.535 --> 01:55:37.757]  But manufacture these new centralized systems.
[01:55:38.277 --> 01:55:42.080]  So regardless, folks, that's the truth and you cannot argue with that.
[01:55:42.740 --> 01:55:48.845]  It is big corporations that lobby for big government and the poor left thinks that big government's going to save them.
[01:55:48.965 --> 01:55:49.485]  It is not.
[01:55:49.726 --> 01:55:51.347]  Now, John, do you disagree with what I just said?
[01:55:52.307 --> 01:55:54.869]  Well, I disagree, and I feel it's too abstract.
[01:55:54.989 --> 01:56:00.292]  I wasn't going to talk about that, but just to encapsulate, I think it's a class issue.
[01:56:00.332 --> 01:56:03.754]  It's a question of that we had a former aristocracy ruling.
[01:56:03.774 --> 01:56:06.196]  We've got a plutocracy, monopoly corporatism.
[01:56:06.216 --> 01:56:09.218]  But you're always going to have an elite that manipulates the general public.
[01:56:09.358 --> 01:56:19.084]  Well, I think we've got to orient towards the middle and manual workers who can somehow take control and decentralize that government and have them take control of that government.
[01:56:19.104 --> 01:56:20.665]  You're always going to have some kind of a government.
[01:56:21.065 --> 01:56:27.229]  But what I also want to talk about is this plan of the globalists, as I was saying.
[01:56:27.249 --> 01:56:27.950]  You know what, John?
[01:56:27.970 --> 01:56:31.072]  I'm going to hold you over if you can do it, but I'm going to stop you right there.
[01:56:31.873 --> 01:56:32.953]  It has never worked.
[01:56:33.073 --> 01:56:42.660]  As soon as you grab a factory, there's going to be some strong man with his, quote, security man, who becomes the de facto owner of that, like the Russian oligarchs.
[01:56:42.780 --> 01:56:45.061]  It does not work.
[01:56:45.502 --> 01:56:47.203]  Are you against private property ownership?
[01:56:47.754 --> 01:56:55.099]  I'm against only that property of the heights of capital, the means of production and distribution held by those who lead it.
[01:56:55.139 --> 01:56:57.441]  But that's organized crime!
[01:56:57.621 --> 01:56:58.402]  Only that, yes.
[01:56:58.442 --> 01:56:59.943]  Those are organized crime syndicates.
[01:56:59.963 --> 01:57:01.604]  They didn't get their property through just means.
[01:57:01.864 --> 01:57:02.544]  Well, exactly.
[01:57:02.745 --> 01:57:05.727]  So I say keep your house, your car, all your personal property.
[01:57:05.807 --> 01:57:09.369]  I agree with you that it's being savaged by the Supreme Court and the rest of it.
[01:57:09.389 --> 01:57:10.310]  So I'm on your side there.
[01:57:10.330 --> 01:57:14.453]  I'm on your side so far as a leftist that we've got to keep our guns.
[01:57:15.173 --> 01:57:17.714]  Uh, as a deterrent to the Marshall Law that's impending.
[01:57:18.154 --> 01:57:23.556]  But I think, uh, as I was saying, what they have against all of these, uh, governments, what you call... John, stay there.
[01:57:23.576 --> 01:57:24.596]  I'll give you five more minutes.
[01:57:24.616 --> 01:57:25.577]  I'm sorry to all the other callers.
[01:57:25.597 --> 01:57:26.277]  We'll get to you too.
[01:57:26.317 --> 01:57:29.198]  And there's just so much news and a surprise guest next hour.
[01:57:29.858 --> 01:57:30.418]  Just stay with us.
[01:57:30.438 --> 01:57:31.199]  Third hour coming up.
[01:57:32.939 --> 01:57:37.521]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:37.541 --> 01:57:37.801]  Hello, folks.
[01:57:49.382 --> 01:57:50.022]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.683 --> 01:57:51.743]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.464 --> 01:57:53.565]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.205 --> 01:57:55.046]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.806 --> 01:57:57.307]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.347 --> 01:58:01.269]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.530 --> 01:58:05.612]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:14.862 --> 01:58:17.964]  Alright folks, we're now into hour number three.
[01:58:17.984 --> 01:58:22.106]  And I really can't give you five minutes, Sean.
[01:58:22.126 --> 01:58:31.450]  I'll give you a few, then I've got to get to Steve and Regina and Daniel and everybody else because I've got a bunch of news and in 30 minutes we've got a guest coming on about the attack on free speech in Texas.
[01:58:31.871 --> 01:58:33.551]  But John, just finish up the point you wanted to make.
[01:58:34.112 --> 01:58:40.635]  Yeah, it's kind of related because as I was saying, what they really had against Milosevic was that he wanted to
[01:58:41.345 --> 01:58:50.394]  Partially, keep the socialized industries, the nationalized industries, the United States, the IMF told them that he had to completely abandon that and join NATO.
[01:58:51.234 --> 01:58:54.517]  Similarly, in Iraq, they've completely privatized it.
[01:58:54.537 --> 01:58:55.779]  Well, you just stole my thunder.
[01:58:56.379 --> 01:58:59.742]  Iraq, half the women, half the people in college were women.
[01:59:00.243 --> 01:59:01.644]  Freedom, Christians were there.
[01:59:02.365 --> 01:59:03.726]  Jews were there and left alone.
[01:59:04.507 --> 01:59:06.469]  They were industrialized on par.
[01:59:07.664 --> 01:59:13.647]  With a first world country, like Portugal, and so they had to be knocked down to Stone Age.
[01:59:14.068 --> 01:59:15.548]  Same thing with Slobo.
[01:59:15.889 --> 01:59:17.429]  I'm not defending either one of these individuals.
[01:59:17.449 --> 01:59:27.735]  The point is, if they're sovereign, and if they have aircraft manufacturing, car manufacturing, the people's standard of living was rising, they just can't put up with that.
[01:59:27.995 --> 01:59:33.318]  Yeah, and some of the independent journalists, not the prostitutes embedded over there like Naomi Klein and Darja Monk,
[01:59:33.738 --> 01:59:34.118]  Why not?
[01:59:34.138 --> 01:59:36.419]  This had nothing to do with freedom, these phony elections.
[01:59:36.559 --> 01:59:55.685]  Even in those controlled elections over there, the winning coalition, the Iraqi Alliance, had to try to track votes by saying their campaign planks were to get the United States out of Iraq and to re-nationalize all the industries that Paul Bremer had privatized and turned over to the American Alibert Bechtel and the various corporations.
[01:59:56.115 --> 02:00:03.461]  So you see here, it has nothing whatsoever to do with freedom, and they actually voted for everything that Bush and company are trying to shut down.
[02:00:03.481 --> 02:00:06.423]  You know, John, I think the problem is we use their term, privatization.
[02:00:06.464 --> 02:00:11.668]  It's not privatization to seize it and give it to a corporation bigger than most governments.
[02:00:12.929 --> 02:00:13.469]  Absolutely.
[02:00:13.489 --> 02:00:14.470]  I mean, it's piracy.
[02:00:14.530 --> 02:00:17.553]  It's like if I pull up beside your ship and take it by force.
[02:00:17.613 --> 02:00:19.154]  I didn't privatize it, I stole it.
[02:00:19.194 --> 02:00:19.794]  Thanks for the call.
[02:00:20.555 --> 02:00:23.517]  Alright, but let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Colorado.
[02:00:23.537 --> 02:00:24.078]  Steve, go ahead.
[02:00:24.841 --> 02:00:25.801]  Yeah, hi there Alex.
[02:00:26.101 --> 02:00:28.642]  Hey, I have a question and then two comments.
[02:00:29.022 --> 02:00:32.123]  First of all, was Sneak and Peek in Patriot 1?
[02:00:32.343 --> 02:00:33.543]  Yes, Section 213.
[02:00:34.323 --> 02:00:39.405]  Okay, and then the next thing is, they're trying to federalize all the laws.
[02:00:39.685 --> 02:00:42.906]  Remember the old phrase, don't make a federal case out of it?
[02:00:43.546 --> 02:00:45.986]  Yeah, everything is going to be a federal case now.
[02:00:46.367 --> 02:00:48.387]  Exactly, so that's part of the plan.
[02:00:48.647 --> 02:00:51.828]  Which federalizes the local government and gives you longer prison sentences.
[02:00:52.839 --> 02:00:59.368]  Yeah, okay, but it's a federalization of everything just so that the federal government becomes, you know, states' rights are out the window.
[02:00:59.528 --> 02:01:03.554]  And what they do is they come in with the grant money that's already our money to begin with.
[02:01:03.654 --> 02:01:04.315]  Oh, yeah.
[02:01:04.915 --> 02:01:10.483]  With a state program, you get about 75% in service back for your dollar, whether that's a good service or not.
[02:01:11.101 --> 02:01:13.122]  Federal, it's 30 cents on the dollar.
[02:01:13.142 --> 02:01:14.603]  This is not free money, folks.
[02:01:15.164 --> 02:01:16.705]  And with it comes control.
[02:01:17.545 --> 02:01:26.031]  Yeah, the carrot is the money, and of course then, after they get the money, then the Federales say, you do it our way.
[02:01:26.772 --> 02:01:27.672]  And what do they fund?
[02:01:27.692 --> 02:01:31.335]  They have thousands of checkpoints a month around the country, and they're all federally funded.
[02:01:31.655 --> 02:01:35.978]  The cops go, we don't like doing this, but it's a federal grant, just to get you all used to it.
[02:01:36.570 --> 02:01:38.011]  That's one example of a thousand.
[02:01:38.391 --> 02:01:41.554]  CPS is federally funded for bounties.
[02:01:42.334 --> 02:01:53.042]  That's why a cop will arrest somebody at a house even if nobody got, even if there was no physical action, physical violence, because if they take somebody to jail, it doesn't even matter if they get convicted, they get money.
[02:01:54.143 --> 02:01:54.903]  I see, okay.
[02:01:55.043 --> 02:01:56.304]  Yeah, there's bounties, sir.
[02:01:57.445 --> 02:01:58.766]  Okay, and then C.A.P.S.
[02:01:58.966 --> 02:02:03.890]  too, is that the police system where they just have a whole national database?
[02:02:04.494 --> 02:02:07.036]  Yeah, that was going to be an airline system, but now it's going to be in everything.
[02:02:07.696 --> 02:02:07.976]  Okay.
[02:02:08.416 --> 02:02:09.737]  And then actually I had another comment.
[02:02:10.338 --> 02:02:14.080]  The Republicans, most of the Republicans are sold out neocons.
[02:02:14.660 --> 02:02:17.302]  The true Republicans basically have almost gone away.
[02:02:17.842 --> 02:02:24.366]  And so the Rockefeller wing of the Republican Party has unfortunately taken over the Republican Party, and thus you have neocons.
[02:02:25.787 --> 02:02:26.788]  I heartily agree with you.
[02:02:26.848 --> 02:02:30.110]  I mean, they were always in predominant control, but now they're in total control.
[02:02:31.031 --> 02:02:34.875]  And the Neocon Talk Show hosts keep all the conservatives asleep as we lose everything.
[02:02:35.996 --> 02:02:38.259]  And Alberto Gonzalez probably will be on the Supreme Court.
[02:02:38.279 --> 02:02:39.320]  They'll probably ban guns.
[02:02:39.580 --> 02:02:40.761]  You'll be a liberal if you're against it.
[02:02:40.781 --> 02:02:41.302]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:46.008 --> 02:02:48.870]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.110 --> 02:02:50.692]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.032 --> 02:02:55.715]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.055 --> 02:03:00.479]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:03:00.919 --> 02:03:05.082]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:03:05.302 --> 02:03:08.146]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.246 --> 02:03:12.912]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.113 --> 02:03:17.519]  Martial law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:17.759 --> 02:03:22.946]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death.
[02:03:23.046 --> 02:03:24.968]  that is sworn to turn the earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:25.208 --> 02:03:27.650]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:03:27.811 --> 02:03:31.374]  Call toll free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:03:45.228 --> 02:03:46.829]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:03:46.989 --> 02:03:51.053]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:03:51.233 --> 02:03:54.115]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:03:54.195 --> 02:04:00.920]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:04:01.100 --> 02:04:04.103]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:04:04.303 --> 02:04:06.685]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:04:06.825 --> 02:04:14.711]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[02:04:15.411 --> 02:04:16.992]  Benzene, Chloride, and Chloroform.
[02:04:17.172 --> 02:04:17.933]  MTBE.
[02:04:18.133 --> 02:04:18.573]  Radon 222.
[02:04:19.033 --> 02:04:21.034]  Foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur.
[02:04:21.174 --> 02:04:26.297]  Even nitrates and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[02:04:26.437 --> 02:04:35.222]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:35.262 --> 02:04:35.482]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:35.522 --> 02:04:37.123]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:04:45.541 --> 02:04:52.427]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[02:04:52.947 --> 02:04:58.371]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:04:58.772 --> 02:05:08.800]  All Natural Non-X is a topical, ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[02:05:08.940 --> 02:05:11.222]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[02:05:11.642 --> 02:05:14.723]  I used to have yellow nails and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[02:05:14.824 --> 02:05:16.324]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[02:05:16.464 --> 02:05:19.406]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris.
[02:05:19.626 --> 02:05:23.948]  It's podiatrist recommended and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[02:05:24.208 --> 02:05:25.928]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[02:05:26.289 --> 02:05:37.574]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, and independent pharmacies nationwide or online at www.drugstore.com.
[02:05:38.534 --> 02:05:42.916]  Non-X Nail Gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[02:05:49.320 --> 02:05:49.920]  Big Brother.
[02:05:50.626 --> 02:05:51.666]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:52.387 --> 02:05:53.527]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.127 --> 02:05:54.987]  You want answers?
[02:05:55.727 --> 02:05:56.708]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.288 --> 02:06:00.909]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.469 --> 02:06:05.630]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:05.770 --> 02:06:15.813]  Alright, here's what I'm gonna do.
[02:06:16.213 --> 02:06:18.714]  We got a guest coming up in about 20 minutes.
[02:06:18.774 --> 02:06:19.734]  23 minutes to be precise.
[02:06:20.797 --> 02:06:26.122]  And I got a bunch of news I need to cover, so we're going to take two more calls today and that's it from Regina and Daniel.
[02:06:26.142 --> 02:06:29.025]  I'm sorry for the other callers, it's just, I gotta cover this other news.
[02:06:29.865 --> 02:06:40.335]  Regina in Pennsylvania, let me guess, I've heard you calling into other shows trying to warn people, I heard you earlier this week talking about how it could come up for a vote, and you're right, it's passed the House and Senate committees.
[02:06:40.816 --> 02:06:42.657]  It now could be passed today or tomorrow.
[02:06:43.078 --> 02:06:45.400]  CAFTA, that is many times
[02:06:46.697 --> 02:06:47.997]  9 to 12 depending on what study.
[02:06:49.018 --> 02:06:54.639]  Larger with a greater economic impact on America and gets rid of a lot of our sovereignty.
[02:06:54.679 --> 02:07:02.380]  The final step towards the free trade area of the Americas with the Canadian media admitting it's the end of their sovereignty as well as ours.
[02:07:03.100 --> 02:07:10.642]  And now it's out that they put out a lot of fake documents and fake news reports and suppress internal federal government studies.
[02:07:10.702 --> 02:07:11.862]  I have those articles today.
[02:07:12.739 --> 02:07:18.341]  These are on top of the ones that came out last week about how bad this will be for the economy, but good for the elite.
[02:07:18.801 --> 02:07:20.381]  Regina, is that what you were calling about?
[02:07:20.701 --> 02:07:23.682]  I'm going to call and just plead with people to call on 877-762-8762.
[02:07:25.943 --> 02:07:28.123]  The battle is in the Congress right now.
[02:07:28.483 --> 02:07:29.764]  We need to decentralize.
[02:07:29.804 --> 02:07:32.944]  We need to use all our army power to call our Congress.
[02:07:33.305 --> 02:07:34.885]  I thank the Lord for the lady that called in.
[02:07:34.905 --> 02:07:37.406]  I wish she would have given me Melissa Hart, Phil English.
[02:07:37.426 --> 02:07:38.466]  I'm glad Doggett
[02:07:38.886 --> 02:07:45.410]  I voted against it, but you know, they are our members of Congress, and the members under this new CAFTA... So I take it I guessed right.
[02:07:45.430 --> 02:07:46.671]  You're calling it about CAFTA.
[02:07:47.011 --> 02:07:47.331]  Amen.
[02:07:47.692 --> 02:07:53.395]  And I just, you know, we all need to call, because we can see... Now notice we had a big debate about NAFTA in 93-94.
[02:07:54.116 --> 02:07:55.196]  Now there's really no debate.
[02:07:55.236 --> 02:07:56.417]  It's like a news blackout.
[02:07:56.597 --> 02:07:57.398]  Well, that's...
[02:07:58.018 --> 02:08:00.501]  We know that, Alex, but we need to bring the debate, you know?
[02:08:01.102 --> 02:08:02.903]  And there's language contained in the trade agreement.
[02:08:02.923 --> 02:08:04.145]  Well, let's give up our private property.
[02:08:04.165 --> 02:08:06.407]  Let's get rid of our... Let's turn our guns in it.
[02:08:06.768 --> 02:08:08.309]  Regina, it's conservative.
[02:08:08.550 --> 02:08:09.931]  No, Alex, it's not, okay?
[02:08:09.951 --> 02:08:10.191]  It's demonic.
[02:08:10.211 --> 02:08:11.313]  But George Bush is in office.
[02:08:11.353 --> 02:08:11.993]  He's good.
[02:08:12.214 --> 02:08:13.735]  It's demonic, okay?
[02:08:14.376 --> 02:08:19.001]  Language contained in this trade agreement would adversely affect your access to dietary supplements.
[02:08:19.577 --> 02:08:24.604]  Members shall base their food safety measures on international standards.
[02:08:24.685 --> 02:08:26.527]  This is the World Union, folks.
[02:08:26.707 --> 02:08:35.741]  It merges our police, it merges the databases, it merges the social security, it merges the military, a continental security perimeter.
[02:08:36.443 --> 02:08:39.506]  Right, but also some of those things have already happened on the Real ID.
[02:08:39.846 --> 02:08:52.136]  We have things like, and I don't want to step on anybody's toes, I need to pray the way I say this, but you know, some of the sugar farmers now, the Republicans in those states are getting a lot of flack because they've lost their industry in those places.
[02:08:52.176 --> 02:08:55.479]  So they're going to buy the sugar farmers out, with what Alex?
[02:08:55.539 --> 02:08:58.461]  What they did under the Trade Promotion Authority, probably what they did under GAAP.
[02:08:58.842 --> 02:09:02.605]  Our tax dollars go subsidize the farmers who lost their business.
[02:09:02.725 --> 02:09:05.107]  It's not my job to subsidize them because they put a bad
[02:09:06.608 --> 02:09:10.212]  I think it's a great thing, Regina, that all the industry is shutting down.
[02:09:10.572 --> 02:09:13.595]  The news told me the economy is great, and I want to be serious here.
[02:09:14.335 --> 02:09:18.760]  All they're doing is printing money at record levels, okay?
[02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:22.163]  That's all the Federal Reserve is doing, because the industry is all shut down.
[02:09:22.463 --> 02:09:24.205]  It's like 90% shut down now, literally.
[02:09:24.967 --> 02:09:26.208]  All they're doing is printing money.
[02:09:26.228 --> 02:09:28.450]  We're still the world reserve currency, not for long.
[02:09:28.751 --> 02:09:31.914]  That's the only reason we're not all out on our hind ends.
[02:09:32.294 --> 02:09:33.415]  We don't make anything.
[02:09:33.455 --> 02:09:34.596]  We don't do anything.
[02:09:34.877 --> 02:09:35.697]  We are a joke.
[02:09:36.018 --> 02:09:37.559]  And this will marginalize the laws.
[02:09:37.639 --> 02:09:46.908]  Also, one of the things I read, information I got, was products can come from China, go to, and this was something that was being debated, I believe,
[02:09:47.284 --> 02:09:52.988]  Somebody, I'm not real sure, but go to one of those Central or South American countries, and then come duty free to America.
[02:09:53.028 --> 02:09:54.609]  What name's going to be on that product, Alex?
[02:09:54.629 --> 02:09:55.070]  We already have it.
[02:09:55.090 --> 02:09:55.670]  Well, no, exactly.
[02:09:55.710 --> 02:10:04.216]  They literally take the, say, telephone, unboxed, and they box it in Mexico or, you know, in Guatemala, and then it comes.
[02:10:04.577 --> 02:10:05.758]  Right.
[02:10:05.778 --> 02:10:07.259]  $617 billion trade deficit.
[02:10:07.559 --> 02:10:11.822]  Remind these people that we do not want any more trade deals.
[02:10:11.862 --> 02:10:15.144]  Look, remind them that we know they're criminals, and we know they're slitting the country's throat.
[02:10:15.165 --> 02:10:15.665]  Thanks for the call.
[02:10:16.425 --> 02:10:17.346]  I appreciate it, Regina.
[02:10:19.027 --> 02:10:19.948]  No, she makes good points.
[02:10:19.988 --> 02:10:20.888]  Call your Congressman.
[02:10:20.908 --> 02:10:21.229]  Call him.
[02:10:21.249 --> 02:10:21.709]  Let him know.
[02:10:21.729 --> 02:10:22.590]  I mean, this is pathetic.
[02:10:23.270 --> 02:10:24.731]  It's wildly unpopular.
[02:10:25.372 --> 02:10:27.753]  It's past the committees, but we've got to fight it.
[02:10:27.773 --> 02:10:32.477]  I just... It's so... Folks, they're butchering.
[02:10:32.497 --> 02:10:34.638]  When I say butcher, I mean, look at everything they're doing.
[02:10:35.359 --> 02:10:37.140]  You're not going to hear Rush Limbaugh talk about it.
[02:10:37.701 --> 02:10:39.522]  You're not going to hear Michael Savage talk about it.
[02:10:40.283 --> 02:10:42.424]  You are not going to hear Sean Hannity talk about it.
[02:10:42.944 --> 02:10:44.926]  You are not going to hear the Democrats talk about it.
[02:10:46.558 --> 02:10:48.479]  This is the sell-out of this country.
[02:10:49.659 --> 02:10:51.080]  Daniel in Louisiana.
[02:10:51.120 --> 02:10:51.801]  Go ahead, Daniel.
[02:10:52.481 --> 02:10:53.021]  Hello, Alex.
[02:10:53.221 --> 02:10:55.323]  The insurgency is about to collapse.
[02:10:58.144 --> 02:10:59.765]  Okay, what insurgency is that?
[02:11:00.406 --> 02:11:03.287]  Oh, that was the comment by the Vice President a few weeks ago.
[02:11:03.888 --> 02:11:05.168]  Oh yeah, and then Bush.
[02:11:05.228 --> 02:11:13.073]  Yeah, we got them on the ropes with all the internal CIA and Pentagon assessments are saying it's about to be total civil war.
[02:11:13.689 --> 02:11:17.112]  And also the sacrifices are vital for our national security.
[02:11:18.713 --> 02:11:22.576]  I saw your friend, Mr. Gergen, on after the speech the other day, I believe CNN.
[02:11:22.596 --> 02:11:24.358]  Kind of interesting.
[02:11:27.880 --> 02:11:38.469]  Just kind of covering it, you know, being, I guess, kind of fair and balanced or whatever, what he thought of, you know, that it's not going to, his speech wasn't all that great, but kind of an expert pundit type thing.
[02:11:39.116 --> 02:11:40.737]  I want to compliment you on your show just calling
[02:12:06.294 --> 02:12:10.375]  You don't have to go through the silly, I don't even call Hannity, Savage, any of those, Rush.
[02:12:10.755 --> 02:12:11.635]  It's a waste of time.
[02:12:11.655 --> 02:12:13.796]  You gotta go through their screeners and play little games.
[02:12:14.056 --> 02:12:18.517]  And if they don't like the angle you're coming from, basically click.
[02:12:18.557 --> 02:12:23.298]  What I wanted to touch on is, I got your video, 9-11 was awesome.
[02:12:23.918 --> 02:12:28.779]  You see things, it's like precious digitation, you can't believe them about the downing of those buildings.
[02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:31.060]  What I wondered if you've covered,
[02:12:32.272 --> 02:12:35.873]  The setting of those explosives must have been such a massive job.
[02:12:36.193 --> 02:12:40.455]  And my mind still wants to say people couldn't do such a thing.
[02:12:41.135 --> 02:12:53.118]  But I heard there was a security guard reading all these websites that said they powered down like the 50th floor and above two days beforehand to install these broadband cables on all these floors.
[02:12:54.599 --> 02:12:55.239]  That's admitted.
[02:12:55.259 --> 02:12:57.599]  It's not some security guard on the internet saying it.
[02:12:57.619 --> 02:12:59.240]  It was in major publications
[02:13:00.242 --> 02:13:13.548]  That they shut down the buildings, the entire buildings, on two separate occasions for entire weekends, and then entire floors were shut down for maintenance and remodeling for weeks in the months before 9-11.
[02:13:14.628 --> 02:13:18.530]  What goes through my mind, who are these people that would do this?
[02:13:18.670 --> 02:13:21.531]  I mean, agents from another country?
[02:13:21.551 --> 02:13:27.894]  Well, that's how intelligence agencies operate, is they do each other's dirty work, and it's just hardcore criminals, sir.
[02:13:29.031 --> 02:13:29.291]  Yeah.
[02:13:30.112 --> 02:13:37.057]  Hardcore criminals that have already done a hundred other dirty jobs, killed families, assassinated people, and they get off on it.
[02:13:37.077 --> 02:13:37.598]  They enjoy it.
[02:13:38.178 --> 02:13:39.219]  I've watched the videos.
[02:13:39.239 --> 02:13:45.204]  You plainly see the cattails popping out of the buildings, you know, asynchronously as they're collapsing.
[02:13:45.324 --> 02:13:49.407]  You know, about five floors below it collapsed, and you see the glass blowing out.
[02:13:49.447 --> 02:13:50.728]  There's no question about it.
[02:13:51.550 --> 02:13:53.751]  That they were, uh, that charge was probably down.
[02:14:22.079 --> 02:14:23.940]  So he's probably the average doe.
[02:14:24.460 --> 02:14:27.881]  That's what most people see when they have the information presented to them.
[02:14:28.281 --> 02:14:29.842]  Hey, listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:14:31.742 --> 02:14:33.743]  This is the end of childhood, folks.
[02:14:33.763 --> 02:14:35.224]  That's a term for growing up.
[02:14:36.404 --> 02:14:36.764]  Okay?
[02:14:37.344 --> 02:14:41.506]  Why do women get in cars with the little yellow Volkswagen with Ted Bundy?
[02:14:42.166 --> 02:14:44.127]  Because they can't believe they're about to be killed.
[02:14:44.887 --> 02:14:45.487]  They're trusting.
[02:14:47.028 --> 02:14:49.789]  Why do people get conned by con artists over and over again?
[02:14:50.914 --> 02:14:52.495]  Why do individuals fall for this?
[02:14:53.837 --> 02:15:02.564]  Most people see the world from a very idiosyncratic view, from their center.
[02:15:03.225 --> 02:15:05.347]  They think the world is what they're thinking.
[02:15:05.707 --> 02:15:09.771]  They think the world ends at the end of their fingertips, at the end of their sight.
[02:15:10.131 --> 02:15:14.795]  They think that the world operates according to their morals, their values, their views.
[02:15:14.915 --> 02:15:16.817]  And folks, it does not operate that way.
[02:15:17.947 --> 02:15:26.152]  I think because somebody's got a short haircut and wears a $2,000, $3,000 suit with a $500 tie, that they're a Christian conservative.
[02:15:26.992 --> 02:15:27.333]  Okay?
[02:15:28.473 --> 02:15:30.494]  I mean, the devil will quote scripture.
[02:15:31.295 --> 02:15:32.055]  They don't know that.
[02:15:33.076 --> 02:15:35.677]  And so it's just, well, I wouldn't do that.
[02:15:35.797 --> 02:15:37.098]  I wouldn't blow those buildings up.
[02:15:37.158 --> 02:15:38.239]  So it must not be true.
[02:15:40.373 --> 02:15:47.319]  And then you give them all the official government plans to do it, all the statements, we need a new Pearl Harbor, a helpful Pearl Harbor, all the evidence of 9-11.
[02:15:47.399 --> 02:15:49.480]  I mean, I'm sorry, folks!
[02:15:51.522 --> 02:15:53.644]  I'm sorry that it's just the way it is.
[02:15:55.866 --> 02:15:57.647]  But, this is the end of childhood.
[02:15:58.528 --> 02:15:59.709]  This is the end of La La Land.
[02:16:00.770 --> 02:16:03.272]  Alright, children too are abused in U.S.
[02:16:03.312 --> 02:16:04.373]  President's New York Times.
[02:16:06.695 --> 02:16:07.135]  And, uh,
[02:16:08.647 --> 02:16:12.030]  It gets into what the government is up to.
[02:16:12.050 --> 02:16:13.290]  I want to cover that when we get back.
[02:16:13.310 --> 02:16:16.293]  They're also torturing children in these camps.
[02:16:17.634 --> 02:16:19.235]  But first I want to get into BBC.
[02:16:19.295 --> 02:16:22.257]  Bush sets up domestic spy services.
[02:16:24.178 --> 02:16:24.278]  U.S.
[02:16:24.298 --> 02:16:35.747]  President George W. Bush has ordered the creation of a domestic intelligence service within the FBI as part of a package of 70 new security measures and nine new agencies.
[02:16:36.543 --> 02:16:36.803]  U.S.
[02:16:36.883 --> 02:16:39.484]  tried to conceal anti-CAFTA reports.
[02:16:40.764 --> 02:16:41.964]  Some of the Associated Press.
[02:16:43.325 --> 02:16:46.386]  President Bush to begin Intel Agency shake-up.
[02:16:46.426 --> 02:16:47.786]  That ties into the first article.
[02:16:49.566 --> 02:16:54.728]  Souter wants real hotel company, wants a real thing to be built on his property.
[02:16:55.068 --> 02:16:59.369]  Hawkeye's iMercury, they just banned mercury-based vaccines in Iowa.
[02:16:59.429 --> 02:16:59.829]  Good news.
[02:17:00.845 --> 02:17:03.806]  Lawmakers wayward email refers to constituents as idiots.
[02:17:03.826 --> 02:17:06.527]  Well, I've talked to a witness who saw Bob Dole call us a bunch of fools.
[02:17:06.567 --> 02:17:07.287]  It'll never wake up.
[02:17:07.968 --> 02:17:10.069]  Student gets F-grade for mentioning God.
[02:17:10.089 --> 02:17:15.411]  Shaney, EKG, media pulse quickening, New York Daily News.
[02:17:16.391 --> 02:17:17.311]  Was he in the hospital?
[02:17:17.331 --> 02:17:18.352]  Why are they covering it up?
[02:17:19.432 --> 02:17:19.532]  U.S.
[02:17:19.572 --> 02:17:20.853]  agrees to send alarms to Egypt.
[02:17:21.373 --> 02:17:24.114]  North Korea resumes building of two nuclear reactors.
[02:17:26.594 --> 02:17:28.456]  And on and on.
[02:17:28.636 --> 02:17:29.617]  ID cards on trial.
[02:17:29.657 --> 02:17:32.820]  Will ID cards have RFID tags?
[02:17:33.321 --> 02:17:36.263]  Virginia Beach to remove red light cameras Friday.
[02:17:36.283 --> 02:17:37.985]  Good news there.
[02:17:38.806 --> 02:17:40.227]  So much coming up.
[02:17:40.447 --> 02:17:40.988]  Stay with us.

[02:17:51.980 --> 02:17:52.801]  Read the labels.
[02:17:53.241 --> 02:17:57.345]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:17:57.585 --> 02:18:01.768]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.

[02:19:44.700 --> 02:19:45.681]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:19:45.761 --> 02:19:50.545]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:19:50.705 --> 02:19:58.511]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:19:58.772 --> 02:20:04.136]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:20:04.356 --> 02:20:11.342]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:20:11.622 --> 02:20:16.964]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[02:20:17.224 --> 02:20:21.946]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[02:20:22.286 --> 02:20:29.869]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[02:20:30.229 --> 02:20:36.473]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[02:20:36.794 --> 02:20:37.834]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:37.854 --> 02:20:38.074]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:00.009 --> 02:21:00.329]  I think so.
[02:21:18.345 --> 02:21:18.885]  I think so.
[02:21:49.654 --> 02:21:51.536]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:21:52.016 --> 02:21:54.919]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:01.124 --> 02:22:10.672]  We'll be talking about how the First Amendment is under attack and the venues that you can use to expose the globalists are being restricted and shut down.
[02:22:12.533 --> 02:22:16.557]  Getting into the news, Bush sets up domestic spy service BBC
[02:22:17.834 --> 02:22:17.954]  U.S.
[02:22:17.994 --> 02:22:27.343]  President George W. Bush has ordered the creation of a new domestic intelligence service within the FBI as part of a package of 70 new security measures.
[02:22:28.063 --> 02:22:31.506]  And again, they set up a blue-ribbon commission of their people who then call for total control.
[02:22:32.668 --> 02:22:36.091]  This is just the military-industrial complex taking possession of America.
[02:22:36.471 --> 02:22:43.077]  The White House says it is enacting the measures to fight international terrorist groups and prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction.
[02:22:44.614 --> 02:22:46.135]  We'll stop selling them to everybody then.
[02:22:46.595 --> 02:22:54.418]  The authorities would also be given the power to seize the property of people deemed to be helping the spread of WMD, so a new asset forfeiture seizure, folks.
[02:22:55.099 --> 02:22:57.700]  An independent commission recommended the measure earlier this year.
[02:22:58.400 --> 02:23:02.322]  An independent commission, like Bush appointed the 9-11 Commission or Reno appointed a commission.
[02:23:02.662 --> 02:23:03.503]  Folks, I'm sick of this.
[02:23:04.043 --> 02:23:06.664]  The new measures are part of Mr. Bush's overhaul of U.S.
[02:23:06.704 --> 02:23:11.846]  intelligence agencies aimed at broadening the fight against terrorism and weapons proliferation.
[02:23:12.447 --> 02:23:13.347]  FBI overhaul.
[02:23:15.123 --> 02:23:20.804]  The FBI is to be reorganized and will include another new intelligence body called the National Security Service.
[02:23:21.384 --> 02:23:23.005]  Well, that sounds like the Gestapo.
[02:23:23.705 --> 02:23:27.605]  And again, they consulted with the former head of the Shkaji, Mr. Wolf.
[02:23:28.766 --> 02:23:30.426]  They also consulted with Primakov.
[02:23:30.446 --> 02:23:31.246]  This is admitted!
[02:23:32.026 --> 02:23:32.786]  These are the guys!
[02:23:33.447 --> 02:23:36.487]  It will assume responsibility for intelligence work within the U.S.
[02:23:37.067 --> 02:23:41.068]  and combine the Justice Department's intelligence, counterterrorism, and espionage units.
[02:23:42.358 --> 02:23:48.960]  Correspondents say the measure is designed to help dissolve the barriers between the FBI and the CIA.
[02:23:48.980 --> 02:23:51.540]  The CIA is not supposed to operate domestically, though they always have.
[02:23:52.120 --> 02:23:57.702]  John Negroponte, the death squad leader, who was given the new job of U.S.
[02:23:57.722 --> 02:24:02.303]  Director of National Intelligence in April, will be charged with putting the changes into effect.
[02:24:02.443 --> 02:24:07.264]  Other measures include... Then it goes on for two and a half pages of small print.
[02:24:08.124 --> 02:24:11.765]  Folks, this is a domestic STASI or KGB or GRU.
[02:24:13.268 --> 02:24:14.609]  An executive order allowing U.S.
[02:24:14.629 --> 02:24:19.372]  authorities to seize the assets of any person or any company thought to be aiding the spread of WMD.
[02:24:19.512 --> 02:24:20.313]  That means anything.
[02:24:21.093 --> 02:24:25.696]  Targets specifically eight companies, including two from North Korea, one Iran, and one from Syria.
[02:24:25.716 --> 02:24:29.359]  Again, it starts with that, but they're using the Patriot Act on homeless people.
[02:24:29.379 --> 02:24:30.860]  That was the Associated Press yesterday.
[02:24:31.600 --> 02:24:36.143]  The establishment of a National Counter-Proliferation Center to centralize U.S.
[02:24:36.263 --> 02:24:36.623]  efforts.
[02:24:36.663 --> 02:24:38.845]  That means to cover up who really carries out the attacks.
[02:24:39.617 --> 02:24:40.157]  And it goes on.
[02:24:40.177 --> 02:24:43.239]  Giving control of overseas human intelligence operations to the CIA.
[02:24:44.100 --> 02:24:51.044]  Seeking the creation of a new assistant attorney general position to centralize responsibility for intelligence and national security at the Justice Department.
[02:24:51.305 --> 02:24:52.265]  Win for the people.
[02:24:52.285 --> 02:24:53.586]  That's a nice little name of it.
[02:24:54.226 --> 02:24:57.989]  The Silverman-Robb Commission handed its report in to Bush in March.
[02:24:58.049 --> 02:24:58.689]  And it goes on and on.
[02:25:00.791 --> 02:25:01.331]  Oh boy.
[02:25:01.491 --> 02:25:02.832]  That is not pretty.
[02:25:03.743 --> 02:25:04.703]  That is not pretty at all.
[02:25:04.743 --> 02:25:06.484]  Talking about CAFTA, I mentioned this earlier.
[02:25:06.504 --> 02:25:07.364]  This is out of the AP.
[02:25:07.784 --> 02:25:08.084]  The U.S.
[02:25:08.104 --> 02:25:10.545]  tried to conceal anti-CAFTA reports.
[02:25:10.985 --> 02:25:11.245]  The U.S.
[02:25:11.305 --> 02:25:20.948]  Labor Department kept secret for more than a year government studies that supported Democratic opponents of the new Central American trade deal devised by President Bush.
[02:25:21.781 --> 02:25:36.912]  Administration internal documents show the studies paid for by the department concluded that several countries the administration wants to be granted free trade status have poor working conditions and fail to protect workers rights and that it will again undercut the United States and our jobs.
[02:25:37.753 --> 02:25:38.373]  And it goes on.
[02:25:39.374 --> 02:25:50.142]  And they also the report came out two days ago about how they knew that his amnesty plan would draw record numbers of illegal aliens here from all over the world and that they knew that's why they wanted to do it.
[02:25:51.403 --> 02:25:56.567]  They know full well what open borders and ordering the Border Patrol to stand down, which they've done will do.
[02:25:57.007 --> 02:26:01.571]  But you're gonna have a domestic Stasi spying on you, but the border's wide open!
[02:26:01.991 --> 02:26:07.775]  With government-trained Los Zetas working for the CIA, going after anybody that didn't control the globalists and killing them.
[02:26:09.797 --> 02:26:13.119]  Folks, Negroponte's death squads are now in America!
[02:26:13.379 --> 02:26:15.201]  And they hired a bunch of them and took them to Iraq!
[02:26:17.288 --> 02:26:21.112]  And 25% of the force in Iraq is Mexican or even Americans.
[02:26:21.532 --> 02:26:22.313]  Or even citizens.
[02:26:22.353 --> 02:26:23.654]  They get their citizenship by doing it.
[02:26:23.794 --> 02:26:26.316]  We literally have foreign Hessian armies.
[02:26:28.018 --> 02:26:29.359]  This is so crazy.
[02:26:29.419 --> 02:26:31.501]  I mean, it's so... I'm shocked by this.
[02:26:32.962 --> 02:26:38.227]  The government funded and trained and protects thousands of these commando killers.
[02:26:39.395 --> 02:26:51.358]  And they've got former Latin American death squad leaders and others working with them, training at bases in South Texas, training at bases in Georgia, training and killing people all over, other drug dealers that aren't controlled by the CIA!
[02:26:52.479 --> 02:26:57.320]  It's just like Colombia, where a third of it's controlled by the FARC, the Communists, I'm not a supporter of them, this is just the facts.
[02:26:57.960 --> 02:27:00.021]  That's the only land that gets sprayed for coca!
[02:27:00.921 --> 02:27:01.541]  And marijuana!
[02:27:03.570 --> 02:27:11.255]  They sent Grasso five years ago down there, New York Stock Exchange head, and he told the head of the FARC, invest with us or we're going to invade.
[02:27:11.476 --> 02:27:11.936]  And they did!
[02:27:12.876 --> 02:27:13.756]  It's the same thing here.
[02:27:13.796 --> 02:27:23.841]  I mean, the government controls hit teams to go after their competition in drugs, but cops out there are going to pull over teenagers today and take them to jail and give them a record for some marijuana?
[02:27:24.181 --> 02:27:26.022]  When your government controls murderers?
[02:27:26.422 --> 02:27:27.943]  Hit teams killing cops?
[02:27:28.383 --> 02:27:29.944]  What is wrong with you people?
[02:27:30.244 --> 02:27:31.264]  Wake up, police!
[02:27:35.406 --> 02:27:36.346]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.807 --> 02:27:38.447]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.308 --> 02:27:42.009]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.006 --> 02:27:51.250]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:27:51.370 --> 02:27:57.553]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:27:57.814 --> 02:28:06.259]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:28:06.519 --> 02:28:13.523]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:28:13.823 --> 02:28:18.666]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:28:18.866 --> 02:28:24.270]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:28:24.610 --> 02:28:27.712]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:28:28.033 --> 02:28:35.998]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:28:36.038 --> 02:28:36.598]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:28:44.504 --> 02:28:51.970]  This is Wendy Malek from Just Shoot Me, here to tell you about Pets 911, a free public service changing the way we care for pets in every community nationwide.
[02:28:52.110 --> 02:28:56.293]  Across the country, there are thousands of healthy, adoptable pets waiting for a loving home every day.

[02:29:08.363 --> 02:29:09.984]  So when thinking adoption, think Pets 911.
[02:29:13.920 --> 02:29:15.620]  Soon, the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[02:29:15.800 --> 02:29:17.821]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[02:29:18.021 --> 02:29:18.701]  Prepare yourself.
[02:29:18.881 --> 02:29:22.582]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.

[02:29:45.043 --> 02:29:48.784]  For a while now you've been hearing about Energize Water and what it can do for your health.
[02:29:49.044 --> 02:29:52.505]  But have you taken the next step and actually experienced Energize Water?

[02:30:47.733 --> 02:30:53.776]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:30:54.376 --> 02:30:57.357]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:58.998 --> 02:31:04.160]  Alright, we've got about 26 minutes left in this Thursday edition.
[02:31:05.900 --> 02:31:07.681]  Big broadcast coming up tomorrow.
[02:31:07.701 --> 02:31:08.361]  You don't want to miss it.
[02:31:08.441 --> 02:31:09.822]  And on Monday, I'm going to re-air.
[02:31:10.706 --> 02:31:24.928]  On the 4th of July, FBI whistleblower information, also the MI5 agent David Shaler blowing the whistle about government involvement in 9-11, and also that interview I did with Professor David Ray Griffin a couple weeks ago.
[02:31:24.988 --> 02:31:26.349]  So that's coming up on Monday.
[02:31:26.369 --> 02:31:27.049]  You don't want to miss it.
[02:31:27.509 --> 02:31:33.230]  On the 4th of July, while you're out there with your hamburgers and hot dogs, you can crank up the radio and maybe wake folks up in the park.
[02:31:34.690 --> 02:31:38.191]  But we see the Supreme Court saying there's no basic private property.
[02:31:38.211 --> 02:31:39.771]  If somebody else wants it, he's got more money.
[02:31:41.029 --> 02:31:42.831]  We see attacks on the Second Amendment.
[02:31:42.871 --> 02:31:45.033]  We see attacks on our borders and our sovereignty.
[02:31:45.933 --> 02:31:53.439]  We see attacks... Peace protesters will be in a crowd of 500 to 1,000 different cases of Bush supporters on a street corner.
[02:31:53.680 --> 02:31:54.560]  They're not permitted.
[02:31:54.580 --> 02:31:56.842]  Neither are the, you know, five people against Bush.
[02:31:57.583 --> 02:32:00.285]  And they come and arrest them and give them six months of peace in federal prison.
[02:32:00.865 --> 02:32:02.807]  And the judge says, yeah, there's no First Amendment.
[02:32:04.135 --> 02:32:13.399]  We see the ADL, if you criticize open borders openly, they won a law in California to arrest you and register you basically in the same database as sex offenders.
[02:32:14.599 --> 02:32:21.942]  We know the Christians out praying on the street corner last year in Philadelphia during the Outfest, the gay pride parade.
[02:32:23.022 --> 02:32:27.204]  The police didn't like it, they arrested them, but luckily the Christians had video, they were just praying.
[02:32:28.024 --> 02:32:33.026]  And they faced 47 years in prison for praying, it was called inciting terrorism.
[02:32:35.074 --> 02:32:36.255]  That was thrown out of court.
[02:32:36.796 --> 02:32:39.418]  The point is the government wants to do this.
[02:32:41.160 --> 02:32:45.343]  And all over the country they're shutting down access television or getting control of content.
[02:32:46.965 --> 02:32:52.149]  And Pat Garlinghouse ran Access TV when I first got on Access TV ten years ago.
[02:32:53.210 --> 02:32:57.394]  And Pat, you know, never censored, did a great job.
[02:32:57.434 --> 02:33:01.498]  And she moved on to Houston and has really built up their access television.
[02:33:02.799 --> 02:33:05.200]  And there was really nothing controversial on there before she went there.
[02:33:05.280 --> 02:33:12.322]  She got all my videos and dropped by, even when she was here in Austin, got like 10 or 15 of them, aired them down there.
[02:33:12.362 --> 02:33:14.083]  They get some of my TV shows and air them down there.
[02:33:14.103 --> 02:33:14.963]  They're very popular.
[02:33:15.363 --> 02:33:17.024]  They put on other shows like Democracy Now!
[02:33:17.084 --> 02:33:22.905]  and stuff, but if you want a show, you can go get one, and potentially hundreds of thousands of people in primetime can watch it.
[02:33:23.245 --> 02:33:24.846]  Houston's got 5 million people in it.
[02:33:25.626 --> 02:33:27.207]  The cable system reaches a couple million.
[02:33:28.127 --> 02:33:30.948]  And they've been trying to shut it down there, trying to shut it down around the country.
[02:33:31.827 --> 02:33:38.350]  And all over the nation, I've probably had 20 news articles where they cite my videos around the country and city councils do shut them down.
[02:33:39.091 --> 02:33:41.652]  And my films are just powerful and it scares people.
[02:33:42.532 --> 02:33:47.555]  And they'll always use the excuse of something sexual to shut them down, but I've talked to the city council members before here in Austin.
[02:33:47.975 --> 02:33:49.636]  It is the political stuff they don't like.
[02:33:50.837 --> 02:34:01.342]  And if you tune in to 7 o'clock, 9 o'clock TV, there's F word, S word on broadcast TV, men in bed together, men and women in bed together, breasts, butts, everything.
[02:34:02.136 --> 02:34:03.798]  You know, all this stuff is going on.
[02:34:04.478 --> 02:34:04.859]  Okay?
[02:34:05.239 --> 02:34:12.445]  But then some goofballs, who I don't agree with, you know, dress up like women on TV and say some cuss words at 2 a.m.
[02:34:12.826 --> 02:34:18.051]  and it's big news in Houston and boy, we need to have the City Council regulate speech and control it.
[02:34:18.751 --> 02:34:23.816]  Meanwhile, at 2 o'clock in the morning on TV, folks, I mean, this is, this stuff a hundred times worse.
[02:34:24.549 --> 02:34:27.730]  Regardless, you let them regulate because of that, they'll regulate everything.
[02:34:28.091 --> 02:34:29.611]  Pat Garlinghouse, thanks for coming on.
[02:34:30.131 --> 02:34:30.652]  You're welcome.
[02:34:30.952 --> 02:34:32.052]  Glad to be with you, Alex.
[02:34:32.452 --> 02:34:32.732]  You bet.
[02:34:32.792 --> 02:34:35.574]  First off, give us the website of Houston Media Source.
[02:34:35.594 --> 02:34:38.455]  Tell us about the channel, how folks can get TV shows down there.
[02:34:38.755 --> 02:34:43.897]  Okay, www.houston-mediasource.org.
[02:34:45.838 --> 02:34:54.101]  And we, like other public access around the country, promote everyone's right to have a free speech option to the mass media.
[02:34:54.611 --> 02:34:57.572]  All they have to do is call, come to our orientation.
[02:34:57.592 --> 02:35:02.394]  We accept tapes on a limited basis from outside of the area.
[02:35:03.194 --> 02:35:04.074]  But give me a call.
[02:35:04.254 --> 02:35:05.915]  I can give you my regular number.
[02:35:05.935 --> 02:35:07.916]  713-524-7700, extension 13.
[02:35:07.956 --> 02:35:10.697]  I'd be happy to talk about options for getting your show on.
[02:35:15.117 --> 02:35:16.158]  And we'll do that.
[02:35:17.318 --> 02:35:21.900]  We'll give that number and that website out again several times before you leave us in about ten minutes.
[02:35:21.960 --> 02:35:22.840]  Pat, I know you're very busy.
[02:35:22.860 --> 02:35:23.821]  I appreciate you coming on.
[02:35:24.341 --> 02:35:37.727]  Tell us in a nutshell what happened and now what this particular City Council person is proposing and how they're trying to blow it out of proportion and how we can call the City Council and try to pressure them politely not to restrict free speech.
[02:35:38.527 --> 02:35:38.967]  Okay.
[02:35:39.708 --> 02:35:40.948]  I don't know specifically.
[02:35:41.228 --> 02:35:42.849]  I still only know third hand.
[02:35:43.516 --> 02:35:48.438]  But, um, one of the council members had a complaint and wanted about our program content.
[02:35:48.698 --> 02:35:50.239]  You don't know the specifics of her complaint.
[02:35:50.279 --> 02:35:51.940]  You do know what's on the news.
[02:35:52.080 --> 02:36:05.525]  I know what's on the news and I know what people have been asking me that they said that she complained about a music video that had the F word several times and there was some partial nudity on some other show and that's the only information I've gotten.
[02:36:06.065 --> 02:36:08.486]  Not the names of the shows or anything more specific.
[02:36:08.506 --> 02:36:11.988]  Well, the callers on and off there said it was some music video with men dressed up like women.
[02:36:13.171 --> 02:36:18.614]  I don't know about the Bendrix, I didn't know that, but I did know that it was a music video that used the F word.
[02:36:19.075 --> 02:36:21.336]  So that might be more information than even we have.
[02:36:21.656 --> 02:36:24.558]  Well, I mean, they do that at 9 o'clock at night on national TV.
[02:36:25.118 --> 02:36:25.759]  Right, right.
[02:36:25.839 --> 02:36:40.047]  And the thing that, if it's one of the music video producers that I know of their programming, it's very, very mild, and there is stuff like that on regular TV in the day, but I can't really comment on this specific thing because I still don't know what it was.
[02:36:40.874 --> 02:36:43.758]  We just know that she's complained and now she's gone to the council?
[02:36:43.838 --> 02:36:49.467]  Well, she, you know, wants to hold up the funding or, you know, preclude the funding for public access.
[02:36:50.945 --> 02:36:52.466]  Now, understand how this works, folks.
[02:36:52.506 --> 02:36:54.467]  You don't pay taxes for AXS TV.
[02:36:54.827 --> 02:37:09.014]  The cable company's got monopolies of right-of-way, hugely profitable, and all Congress said back in the seventies was, okay, provide a channel for citizens to come down and have a soapbox, predominantly for politics, but whatever else you want to do, because that's free speech and expression.
[02:37:09.735 --> 02:37:17.859]  And now she's running around on TV, and it's also been in the newspaper, saying that she wants some body to regulate speech or something?
[02:37:18.679 --> 02:37:27.187]  Yeah, well, it sort of precipitated a conversation and discussion about how can we address the programming content on Houston Media Source.
[02:37:29.209 --> 02:37:32.192]  And you dealt with that here when you were the director in Austin, too.
[02:37:33.113 --> 02:37:40.480]  Sure, but I think in Austin most people understood that they couldn't regulate in any way content.
[02:37:41.221 --> 02:37:43.802]  I think in Houston it may still be a little unclear.
[02:37:44.242 --> 02:37:47.704]  Well, Houston is a black hole of information.
[02:37:47.784 --> 02:37:51.045]  It's nothing but neocon lies on radio and TV.
[02:37:51.105 --> 02:37:57.088]  It's probably the worst city in the country for propaganda, because there are good conservative people there, and they've got to keep them in the dark.
[02:37:57.508 --> 02:38:04.572]  And I know we've been having a massive effect the last three years you've been there, Pat, or maybe longer, airing my films there on a weekly basis, don't you?
[02:38:04.812 --> 02:38:05.892]  Oh, very popular films.
[02:38:06.292 --> 02:38:09.734]  I mean, people call in and say, where's Alex Jones Show for this week?
[02:38:10.295 --> 02:38:12.006]  Yeah, I gotta send you a couple of the new films.
[02:38:13.161 --> 02:38:15.362]  Pat, like Martial Law and American Dictators.
[02:38:16.143 --> 02:38:17.584]  Three hours long, played in three parts.
[02:38:18.784 --> 02:38:20.665]  Give us your website, your phone number again.
[02:38:20.725 --> 02:38:22.526]  It's got the City Council numbers on it.
[02:38:22.967 --> 02:38:28.710]  Folks, seriously, if you live in Texas or Houston or anywhere, you need to call them and say, knock it off, give us a break.
[02:38:29.030 --> 02:38:30.471]  Cuss words at 2am.
[02:38:30.871 --> 02:38:32.512]  Look, I don't support that.
[02:38:32.652 --> 02:38:34.553]  You have to support it because it's the First Amendment.
[02:38:34.893 --> 02:38:36.654]  I have the right to say that's dumb.
[02:38:37.074 --> 02:38:39.116]  But at the same time, folks, that is nothing.
[02:38:39.596 --> 02:38:41.757]  Pat, give us the phone number and website.
[02:38:41.877 --> 02:38:42.217]  Okay.
[02:38:42.497 --> 02:38:43.517]  My phone number is 713-524-7700, extension 13.
[02:38:43.558 --> 02:38:45.078]  I'm willing to talk to anyone anytime.
[02:38:45.098 --> 02:38:45.878]  Give it out again slowly.
[02:38:45.898 --> 02:38:46.418]  713-524-7700, extension 13.
[02:38:46.458 --> 02:38:48.359]  And our website is www.houston-mediasource.com.
[02:39:06.517 --> 02:39:07.457]  OneWord.org.
[02:39:07.557 --> 02:39:09.298]  You know what I wish we had, Pat?
[02:39:09.338 --> 02:39:10.679]  Because I don't have the money or the staff.
[02:39:11.139 --> 02:39:21.503]  I wish an Austin listener would call you, volunteer, to tape my TV show and to mail it to you each week, or maybe once a month, so you could have one of my regular TV shows down there.
[02:39:21.803 --> 02:39:23.684]  Actually, somebody was talking about doing that.
[02:39:23.944 --> 02:39:28.966]  Someone did contact us, and we thought that was fine, and we thought somebody was doing that.
[02:39:29.006 --> 02:39:31.087]  I think when we lived over on Bylam.
[02:39:32.127 --> 02:39:34.408]  Yeah, you guys have moved offices to a bigger facility.
[02:39:34.608 --> 02:39:35.269]  Oh, it's great.
[02:39:35.289 --> 02:39:36.009]  You should see it.
[02:39:36.863 --> 02:39:44.025]  Well, you know, they're shutting it down all over the country, and while it's there in Houston under your tutelage, anybody, everybody should use it.
[02:39:44.825 --> 02:39:46.605]  If you live in Houston, you should be using it.
[02:39:46.625 --> 02:39:49.006]  I know we have a lot of listeners in Houston on the internet at Shortwave.
[02:39:49.626 --> 02:39:51.646]  We have a lot of listeners on AM and FM around the state.
[02:39:52.687 --> 02:39:54.027]  People need to use this, folks.
[02:39:54.547 --> 02:39:58.048]  Look, we've had Senators fly to Austin to speak to 500 of us.
[02:39:59.730 --> 02:40:01.491]  They know the power of talking to crowds.
[02:40:02.072 --> 02:40:04.834]  Imagine having a show on at, what, eight, nine o'clock at night.
[02:40:05.254 --> 02:40:08.176]  Pat, any estimation on what type of viewership you've got, potentially?
[02:40:08.697 --> 02:40:16.503]  Well, we have over a million subscribers if you count all the apartments and the individual ones that aren't counted as single ones.
[02:40:16.883 --> 02:40:18.484]  Well, there's five million people in Houston.
[02:40:18.584 --> 02:40:18.864]  Right.
[02:40:18.884 --> 02:40:21.366]  Well, inside the city limits, we have three million.
[02:40:21.987 --> 02:40:29.172]  And then the surrounding areas, if they get any of the coverage that is within the city, I'd say at least three million.
[02:40:30.086 --> 02:40:30.686]  Absolutely.
[02:40:30.726 --> 02:40:32.907]  So folks need to really, I mean, come on.
[02:40:33.167 --> 02:40:38.148]  Everybody's always saying they want a way to fight the globalists, fight the corruption, fight all this stuff that's happening.
[02:40:38.349 --> 02:40:39.949]  Use access television in your area.
[02:40:40.269 --> 02:40:44.810]  Pat, for those, I always get these questions, for those in a nutshell, how does access TV usually work?
[02:40:45.131 --> 02:40:53.233]  How does somebody say in, you know, Billy Bob Maine or Houston, Texas, how do you come down and get an access TV show?
[02:40:55.074 --> 02:40:58.975]  You find our phone number and call it and come on down.
[02:40:59.015 --> 02:40:59.995]  We have orientation.
[02:41:00.675 --> 02:41:02.296]  You get all your questions answered.
[02:41:02.316 --> 02:41:06.096]  I usually want a couple classes that might take five or six nights.
[02:41:06.316 --> 02:41:11.998]  If they don't have access to their own equipment, we have very short, very inexpensive classes.
[02:41:12.298 --> 02:41:13.758]  Less than $50 usually.
[02:41:14.198 --> 02:41:15.178]  Three nights max.
[02:41:16.359 --> 02:41:18.019]  You can get on the air within that week.
[02:41:18.698 --> 02:41:35.309]  I've got to tell you Pat, 11 years ago I went down to AXS, did shows for a year as a guest before I got my own show, took 3 little $25 classes, that's how much it was then, it's like $50 now, took 3 classes, learned how to use a camera, learned how to edit,
[02:41:36.090 --> 02:41:39.012]  And now I have documentaries that are winning awards around the world.
[02:41:39.292 --> 02:41:39.972]  I know that.
[02:41:40.012 --> 02:41:40.713]  You're amazing.
[02:41:40.873 --> 02:41:41.353]  Well, no, no.
[02:41:41.413 --> 02:41:42.353]  I keep my horn.
[02:41:42.393 --> 02:41:43.694]  You guys are amazing.
[02:41:43.714 --> 02:41:45.775]  I mean, you talk about real training.
[02:41:45.795 --> 02:41:48.016]  You talk about really getting a leg up in the media.
[02:41:48.056 --> 02:41:55.380]  I know people that slave as interns for five years and then spend ten years, you know, at eight bucks an hour working at radio stations and never get their break.
[02:41:55.781 --> 02:41:56.661]  I got my break.
[02:41:56.781 --> 02:41:57.742]  I got a radio show.
[02:41:57.842 --> 02:41:58.822]  I got a syndicated show.
[02:41:59.082 --> 02:42:02.104]  Now I'm in Hollywood movies talking about the New World Order, Pat.
[02:42:02.364 --> 02:42:03.645]  I owe it all to AXS television.
[02:42:03.725 --> 02:42:04.686]  That's exactly right.
[02:42:04.706 --> 02:42:09.108]  Isn't it wonderful to be able to talk about how wonderful AXS television is around the country?
[02:42:09.669 --> 02:42:10.729]  Everyone should be using it.
[02:42:10.749 --> 02:42:15.132]  Well, the famous director here in Austin, Rodriguez, he got his start at AXS TV.
[02:42:15.192 --> 02:42:16.873]  He used the equipment for El Mariachi.
[02:42:16.993 --> 02:42:17.574]  He sure did.
[02:42:17.594 --> 02:42:19.675]  I was there then, actually.
[02:42:21.094 --> 02:42:24.796]  Tommy Pallotta, who produces a lot of big films.
[02:42:25.156 --> 02:42:25.937]  Rick Linklater.
[02:42:26.537 --> 02:42:34.121]  Rick Linklater, Tommy Pallotta started out down there with Human Events, that documentary show.
[02:42:35.621 --> 02:42:38.603]  Right, the first step is just to learn all about what media literacy is.
[02:42:38.663 --> 02:42:50.269]  You know, how media shadows what the truth is, or they have their own opinions because they're commercial, and this is a non-commercial format that everyone can use where their rights are protected.
[02:42:52.205 --> 02:42:55.287]  Pat, I wanted to ask you a question on air about the Austin Access.
[02:42:55.387 --> 02:42:59.450]  They just will not enforce commercialism now, which I commend you for doing.
[02:42:59.871 --> 02:43:02.392]  It is a problem when people are putting infomercials on.
[02:43:03.213 --> 02:43:04.554]  I know you don't allow that in Houston.
[02:43:05.174 --> 02:43:15.042]  Well, there's a fine line between commercialism and infomercial, and I try to stay away from all of it and keep it very clean so that we don't have to worry about any of those commercial areas.
[02:43:15.062 --> 02:43:17.804]  Well, I agree, and then that violates the charter.
[02:43:19.242 --> 02:43:20.502]  Right, with the franchise.
[02:43:20.602 --> 02:43:22.503]  And Time Warner doesn't like that, and I don't blame them.
[02:43:22.543 --> 02:43:23.703]  I think that's justified.
[02:43:24.043 --> 02:43:25.804]  Because they do subsidize the channels.
[02:43:26.504 --> 02:43:26.704]  Yep.
[02:43:26.944 --> 02:43:30.685]  Well, Pat, why don't you come back and run the access here in Austin?
[02:43:30.805 --> 02:43:31.385]  I would love to!
[02:43:31.425 --> 02:43:33.045]  I don't know what's going to happen here, Alex.
[02:43:33.065 --> 02:43:33.946]  Save me a spot!
[02:43:34.866 --> 02:43:45.349]  Well, I'll tell you, Pat, we need to get... I mean, look, millions of potential viewers, folks, and you start doing a show, you'll have thousands the first night, the next weekend's of thousands.
[02:43:46.109 --> 02:43:46.449]  Instant.
[02:43:46.509 --> 02:43:47.029]  It's wonderful.
[02:43:47.549 --> 02:43:49.310]  You will build an audience very quickly.
[02:43:50.190 --> 02:43:52.211]  And look, my little AXS TV show.
[02:43:52.331 --> 02:43:56.052]  One year it's the UT football game wins favorite show of the year in the Reader's Bowl.
[02:43:57.172 --> 02:43:59.993]  Next year it's Austin City Limits, national show.
[02:44:00.433 --> 02:44:02.394]  And then my TV shows won several times.
[02:44:02.474 --> 02:44:05.555]  Not best AXS show, best TV show, folks.
[02:44:06.155 --> 02:44:09.317]  And they even had some one-time Nielsen ratings were done on cable.
[02:44:09.597 --> 02:44:10.957]  We showed up pretty high on there.
[02:44:11.317 --> 02:44:14.118]  That makes the establishment very angry, Pat.
[02:44:14.818 --> 02:44:16.199]  I totally understand.
[02:44:17.426 --> 02:44:19.567]  Well, it's something people should take advantage of.
[02:44:19.587 --> 02:44:23.028]  What if somebody lives outside Houston?
[02:44:23.088 --> 02:44:27.550]  Isn't it just a little bit bigger yearly fee to live outside Houston but have your own show?
[02:44:27.870 --> 02:44:36.633]  Yes, slightly bigger and less priority in terms of scheduling their show because it is primarily... That comes from the federal law, that's not you.
[02:44:36.673 --> 02:44:37.154]  Go ahead.
[02:44:37.234 --> 02:44:38.474]  Right, well and the franchise.
[02:44:38.554 --> 02:44:43.196]  I mean it is a channel that is subsidized for local citizens and that's good.
[02:44:43.817 --> 02:44:50.179]  And we look for people outside the area if they want to come here who have something to offer the local area.
[02:44:50.259 --> 02:44:54.160]  It's not like they can just have something that's totally unrelated to Houston.
[02:44:54.760 --> 02:45:06.964]  And, you know, for the distance and the admin fees that would be slightly different for out of town, we do charge a slightly higher fee, but we believe if they don't have access available in their area, that the nearest one should be available to them as well.
[02:45:06.984 --> 02:45:11.526]  Now, I understand, folks, that's just your license, which is like a hundred bucks a year in Austin.
[02:45:11.546 --> 02:45:12.286]  What does it do there?
[02:45:14.326 --> 02:45:15.186]  Which license, Alex?
[02:45:15.287 --> 02:45:17.027]  The producer license.
[02:45:17.668 --> 02:45:18.808]  Oh, and here it's $150.
[02:45:19.649 --> 02:45:22.070]  Okay, and again, that's needed to pay the staff, folks.
[02:45:22.690 --> 02:45:25.712]  You got that fee and then a couple classes that are, what, $50 a piece?
[02:45:25.832 --> 02:45:26.552]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:45:26.752 --> 02:45:41.279]  So for about $250, a year of programming, folks, it is so serious, you need to... and look, Pat, I would imagine the reason you air my documentaries is because the police state and the corruption, that affects everybody on a local level.
[02:45:41.299 --> 02:45:42.240]  Is that why you air my films?
[02:45:43.243 --> 02:45:48.604]  Well, certainly, you know, my personal opinion might be different, but the people demand it.
[02:45:48.664 --> 02:45:49.504]  They like your show.
[02:45:49.924 --> 02:45:52.505]  They believe what you say and they want to see it.
[02:45:54.065 --> 02:46:01.727]  And so programs that were similar that are covering, you know, things that affect all Houstonites, that could be allowable on the channel then?
[02:46:02.347 --> 02:46:05.428]  Everything as long as it's within the law of the country.
[02:46:05.448 --> 02:46:10.329]  You know, like it doesn't violate libel, slander,
[02:46:10.916 --> 02:46:12.257]  And that it's non-commercial.
[02:46:12.418 --> 02:46:12.758]  Exactly.
[02:46:12.778 --> 02:46:15.260]  To be clear, if you live in Houston, you can go on the air and do whatever you want.
[02:46:15.340 --> 02:46:26.891]  It's just that if you're outside the city, then, you know, and it's a show about, say, Connecticut, you know, water quality, well, there's no reason to have a Connecticut water quality show on Houston Media Source.
[02:46:27.071 --> 02:46:27.552]  Exactly.
[02:46:27.952 --> 02:46:29.854]  Okay, so, that's the difference.
[02:46:30.394 --> 02:46:32.176]  And listen, this stuff's powerful, folks.
[02:46:32.276 --> 02:46:33.938]  Now, state congressmen
[02:46:35.685 --> 02:46:40.327]  Federal congressmen are producing weekly TV shows just for Austin Access.
[02:46:40.947 --> 02:46:47.649]  In a fancy studio with this Williamson County creature up there telling us how wonderful the New World Order is every week.
[02:46:48.249 --> 02:46:59.513]  Folks, if a congressman is producing a show just for Austin Access, it's because he knows, folks, tens of thousands of people when that comes on Wednesday night at 7 o'clock are watching it.
[02:47:01.013 --> 02:47:03.135]  So, again, it's not a waste of time.
[02:47:03.255 --> 02:47:04.155]  Do it, do it, do it.
[02:47:04.456 --> 02:47:06.617]  Pat, give us your website and phone number one more time.
[02:47:06.917 --> 02:47:08.719]  Okay, website, www.houston-mediasource.org.
[02:47:08.979 --> 02:47:11.040]  My phone number, 713-524-7700, extension 13.
[02:47:11.120 --> 02:47:15.323]  Folks, it is an underused, wonderful First Amendment system.
[02:47:26.934 --> 02:47:30.755]  And the airwaves and the transmission lines supposedly belong to the people.
[02:47:30.816 --> 02:47:36.358]  And while these avenues are still open, because they are moving to try to take it over, use it or lose it.
[02:47:36.478 --> 02:47:41.520]  Especially the more people get involved, the stronger and more vibrant these institutions are.
[02:47:43.500 --> 02:47:44.721]  Would you agree with that statement, Pat?
[02:47:44.921 --> 02:47:45.461]  Absolutely.
[02:47:45.541 --> 02:47:53.684]  And especially in light, I'm sure you're on top of the emerging technology with the telephone companies having the debate as well.
[02:47:53.904 --> 02:47:55.785]  Texas, I guess, was one of the test states.
[02:47:56.671 --> 02:48:06.019]  to eliminate local franchising and local access to wireless with SBC and Time Warner and those things.
[02:48:06.080 --> 02:48:07.541]  Are you up on that one?
[02:48:08.081 --> 02:48:10.543]  Yeah, they're trying to shut it down in the next three years.
[02:48:10.603 --> 02:48:18.731]  Well, and now there's a movement, I think, I don't know exactly which one it is, nationally, you know, so that would threaten things like public access as well.
[02:48:18.851 --> 02:48:22.434]  So that was the big thing that was defeated just recently in Austin, but
[02:48:23.813 --> 02:48:26.274]  That's on the horizon, so folks need to be aware of that.
[02:48:26.474 --> 02:48:30.537]  Alright, Pat Garlinghouse from Houston Media Source, thank you for coming on with us.
[02:48:31.318 --> 02:48:32.339]  Loved it, thanks Alex.
[02:48:32.519 --> 02:48:33.059]  God bless.
[02:48:33.739 --> 02:48:40.524]  Folks, go to that website, get the City Council numbers, and call those creatures immediately.
[02:48:40.544 --> 02:48:42.866]  Some final news on the other side.
[02:48:45.467 --> 02:48:52.314]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:48:52.634 --> 02:48:54.016]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:54.196 --> 02:48:56.418]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:56.558 --> 02:48:58.660]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:58.921 --> 02:49:03.865]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:04.186 --> 02:49:08.230]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:08.470 --> 02:49:10.231]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:49:10.311 --> 02:49:20.957]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.117 --> 02:49:23.018]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:49:23.218 --> 02:49:25.279]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today.
[02:49:25.479 --> 02:49:26.119]  We're good to go.

[02:51:56.375 --> 02:51:58.556]  Police briefly evacuate the U.S.
[02:51:58.676 --> 02:51:59.976]  Capitol today again.
[02:51:59.996 --> 02:52:04.997]  And they did it because some plane got barely out of its airspace.
[02:52:05.737 --> 02:52:06.857]  Total fear-mongering.
[02:52:07.357 --> 02:52:11.198]  Training everybody that the nice men with machine guns and black uniforms control the Congress.
[02:52:11.738 --> 02:52:14.479]  That's all this is, is drills for martial law to create fear.
[02:52:15.719 --> 02:52:16.319]  Good news!
[02:52:16.999 --> 02:52:19.640]  Virginia Beach removed red-light cameras Friday.
[02:52:20.908 --> 02:52:26.936]  Red light cameras, plug to be pulled, only after a few months of operation in Virginia Beach.
[02:52:27.554 --> 02:52:28.954]  Well, they've been found to be illegal, folks.
[02:52:28.974 --> 02:52:30.555]  You have private companies giving you tickets.
[02:52:31.115 --> 02:52:32.395]  Plus, they cause more accidents.
[02:52:32.415 --> 02:52:33.816]  They shorten the yellow lights to do it.
[02:52:34.376 --> 02:52:41.798]  Officials in Virginia Beach, Virginia are preparing to shut down their red light cameras program this Friday, even though it has been operational for less than a year.
[02:52:42.358 --> 02:52:44.799]  Virginia law will not allow the devices for July 1st.
[02:52:45.099 --> 02:52:45.359]  Yes!
[02:52:45.979 --> 02:52:52.101]  The Virginia legislature adjourned in April after refusing to renew the law authorizing camera enforcement within the state.
[02:52:53.556 --> 02:52:59.240]  See folks, it's the state legislatures where we have the power to say no to the Patriot Act, no to land grabs.
[02:52:59.800 --> 02:53:02.322]  The government, the feds, can say the states don't have the power.
[02:53:02.882 --> 02:53:03.382]  But they do.
[02:53:03.502 --> 02:53:05.284]  We go get the states to not take federal money.
[02:53:05.304 --> 02:53:10.107]  We go get the states, we take these over before they put the electronic voting machines in and take our right to vote away.
[02:53:11.447 --> 02:53:12.328]  So good news there.
[02:53:14.409 --> 02:53:19.132]  And this was a college student, an honor college student, excuse me, a freshman, not a high school senior.
[02:53:19.152 --> 02:53:19.893]  That was a correction.
[02:53:20.549 --> 02:53:27.734]  A student gets an F grade for mentioning God, he told me, you might think as well and write about the Easter Bunny.
[02:53:29.215 --> 02:53:36.720]  A college in Southern California is investigating the case of a student who says she was given an F for mentioning God against the express wishes of her atheist instructor.
[02:53:37.081 --> 02:53:38.782]  So see, mind control, folks!
[02:53:39.514 --> 02:53:41.216]  Punishing people for thought crime!
[02:53:41.636 --> 02:53:50.564]  Bethany Hoff, a freshman at Victor Valley Community College near San Bernardino, wrote the G-word in her paper, In God We Trust, explaining the role of religion in government.
[02:53:50.744 --> 02:53:54.047]  And he said, uh, I don't want to hear about the First Amendment.
[02:53:54.988 --> 02:53:57.390]  I lose my First Amendment rights when I go to college.
[02:53:58.091 --> 02:54:00.713]  And that she was told not to mention God, so see?
[02:54:01.849 --> 02:54:03.090]  That's just incredible, folks.
[02:54:03.310 --> 02:54:03.911]  Absolutely.
[02:54:03.931 --> 02:54:05.192]  These people are out of control.
[02:54:05.693 --> 02:54:06.233]  Good news!
[02:54:06.474 --> 02:54:09.817]  Iowa has banned thimerosal mercury in vaccines.
[02:54:12.127 --> 02:54:17.269]  Cheney, E.K.G., media pulse quickening, New York Daily News.
[02:54:17.749 --> 02:54:23.391]  Did Vice President Cheney receive impromptu medical care Friday in the cardiac unit of Colorado Hospital?
[02:54:23.871 --> 02:54:33.395]  I'm intrigued by the possibility, even though the Veep's press secretary, Leah Ann McBride, yesterday told me the report from liberal blogger Arianna Huffington was unequivocally false.
[02:54:34.088 --> 02:54:42.790]  After having been said Friday night on our website that Cheney received an EKG at the Vail Valley Medical Center, Cheney's office and the hospital fielded a barrage of press calls.
[02:54:42.810 --> 02:54:44.851]  Their responses were confusing, to say the least.
[02:54:45.431 --> 02:54:51.793]  Initially, the hospital officials denied that Cheney, who had been attending the American Enterprise Institute World Forum, had been visited at the hospital.
[02:54:52.113 --> 02:54:56.674]  Then the VEAPS office acknowledged the Associated Press that Cheney indeed visited, but only to see prominent
[02:54:57.374 --> 02:55:01.157]  Uh, Osteopath Richard Steedman about a knee problem.
[02:55:01.217 --> 02:55:04.259]  The local paper, the Vail Daily, characterized Cheney's visit as social.
[02:55:05.960 --> 02:55:20.210]  Uh, but, uh, Huffington, who was in town to speak to the Vail Valley Institute on spot, on, uh, the spotted of the Veeps Gulf Stream in the airport, reported the Vice President did see Dr. Steedman, but he then proceeded to the cardiac unit of the center to see Dr. Jack Eek.
[02:55:20.610 --> 02:55:24.293]  While there, Cheney had a, uh, EKG.
[02:55:25.376 --> 02:55:26.897]  Prophylactic EKG.
[02:55:28.378 --> 02:55:35.081]  We are out of time, ladies and gentlemen, and I really wish we had more time, but that is it for this transmission.
[02:55:37.382 --> 02:55:38.363]  Have faith in freedom.
[02:55:38.423 --> 02:55:39.043]  Get involved.
[02:55:39.083 --> 02:55:39.824]  Become a leader.

[02:55:41.365 --> 02:55:42.265]  Ask God for guidance.
[02:55:42.285 --> 02:55:47.288]  And, you know, I'll probably forget to send my new video to the Houston Media Source.
[02:55:47.308 --> 02:55:48.649]  Why don't you get it and send it to them, folks?
